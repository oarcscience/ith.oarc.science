What is it?<br>  The phantom of a cup that comes and goes?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, monk! what phantom?" answered Percivale.<br>  "The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord<br>  Drank at the last sad supper with his own.<br>  This, from the blessed land of Aromat--<br>  After the day of darkness, when the dead<br>  Went wandering o'er Moriah--the good saint<br>  Arimathaean Joseph, journeying brought<br>  To Glastonbury, where the winter thorn<br>  Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.<br>  And there awhile it bode; and if a man<br>  Could touch or see it, he was healed at once,<br>  By faith, of all his ills. But then the times<br>  Grew to such evil that the holy cup<br>  Was caught away to Heaven, and disappeared."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the monk: "From our old books I know<br>  That Joseph came of old to Glastonbury,<br>  And there the heathen Prince, Arviragus,<br>  Gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build;<br>  And there he built with wattles from the marsh<br>  A little lonely church in days of yore,<br>  For so they say, these books of ours, but seem<br>  Mute of this miracle, far as I have read.<br>  But who first saw the holy thing today?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A woman," answered Percivale, "a nun,<br>  And one no further off in blood from me<br>  Than sister; and if ever holy maid<br>  With knees of adoration wore the stone,<br>  A holy maid; though never maiden glowed,<br>  But that was in her earlier maidenhood,<br>  With such a fervent flame of human love,<br>  Which being rudely blunted, glanced and shot<br>  Only to holy things; to prayer and praise<br>  She gave herself, to fast and alms. And yet,<br>  Nun as she was, the scandal of the Court,<br>  Sin against Arthur and the Table Round,<br>  And the strange sound of an adulterous race,<br>  Across the iron grating of her cell<br>  Beat, and she prayed and fasted all the more.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And he to whom she told her sins, or what<br>  Her all but utter whiteness held for sin,<br>  A man wellnigh a hundred winters old,<br>  Spake often with her of the Holy Grail,<br>  A legend handed down through five or six,<br>  And each of these a hundred winters old,<br>  From our Lord's time. And when King Arthur made<br>  His Table Round, and all men's hearts became<br>  Clean for a season, surely he had thought<br>  That now the Holy Grail would come again;<br>  But sin broke out. Ah, Christ, that it would come,<br>  And heal the world of all their wickedness!<br>  'O Father!' asked the maiden, 'might it come<br>  To me by prayer and fasting?' 'Nay,' said he,<br>  'I know not, for thy heart is pure as snow.'<br>  And so she prayed and fasted, till the sun<br>  Shone, and the wind blew, through her, and I thought<br>  She might have risen and floated when I saw her.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For on a day she sent to speak with me.<br>  And when she came to speak, behold her eyes<br>  Beyond my knowing of them, beautiful,<br>  Beyond all knowing of them, wonderful,<br>  Beautiful in the light of holiness.<br>  And 'O my brother, Percivale,' she said,<br>  'Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail:<br>  For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound<br>  As of a silver horn from o'er the hills<br>  Blown, and I thought, "It is not Arthur's use<br>  To hunt by moonlight;" and the slender sound<br>  As from a distance beyond distance grew<br>  Coming upon me--O never harp nor horn,<br>  Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,<br>  Was like that music as it came; and then<br>  Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam,<br>  And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,<br>  Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,<br>  Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed<br>  With rosy colours leaping on the wall;<br>  And then the music faded, and the Grail<br>  Past, and the beam decayed, and from the walls<br>  The rosy quiverings died into the night.<br>  So now the Holy Thing is here again<br>  Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,<br>  And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,<br>  That so perchance the vision may be seen<br>  By thee and those, and all the world be healed.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then leaving the pale nun, I spake of this<br>  To all men; and myself fasted and prayed<br>  Always, and many among us many a week<br>  Fasted and prayed even to the uttermost,<br>  Expectant of the wonder that would be.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And one there was among us, ever moved<br>  Among us in white armour, Galahad.<br>  'God make thee good as thou art beautiful,'<br>  Said Arthur, when he dubbed him knight; and none,<br>  In so young youth, was ever made a knight<br>  Till Galahad; and this Galahad, when he heard<br>  My sister's vision, filled me with amaze;<br>  His eyes became so like her own, they seemed<br>  Hers, and himself her brother more than I.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister or brother none had he; but some<br>  Called him a son of Lancelot, and some said<br>  Begotten by enchantment--chatterers they,<br>  Like birds of passage piping up and down,<br>  That gape for flies--we know not whence they come;<br>  For when was Lancelot wanderingly lewd?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she, the wan sweet maiden, shore away<br>  Clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair<br>  Which made a silken mat-work for her feet;<br>  And out of this she plaited broad and long<br>  A strong sword-belt, and wove with silver thread<br>  And crimson in the belt a strange device,<br>  A crimson grail within a silver beam;<br>  And saw the bright boy-knight, and bound it on him,<br>  Saying, 'My knight, my love, my knight of heaven,<br>  O thou, my love, whose love is one with mine,<br>  I, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.<br>  Go forth, for thou shalt see what I have seen,<br>  And break through all, till one will crown thee king<br>  Far in the spiritual city:' and as she spake<br>  She sent the deathless passion in her eyes<br>  Through him, and made him hers, and laid her mind<br>  On him, and he believed in her belief.<br>   <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then came a year of miracle: O brother,<br>  In our great hall there stood a vacant chair,<br>  Fashioned by Merlin ere he past away,<br>  And carven with strange figures; and in and out<br>  The figures, like a serpent, ran a scroll<br>  Of letters in a tongue no man could read.<br>  And Merlin called it 'The Siege perilous,'<br>  Perilous for good and ill; 'for there,' he said,<br>  'No man could sit but he should lose himself:'<br>  And once by misadvertence Merlin sat<br>  In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,<br>  Galahad, when he heard of Merlin's doom,<br>  Cried, 'If I lose myself, I save myself!'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then on a summer night it came to pass,<br>  While the great banquet lay along the hall,<br>  That Galahad would sit down in Merlin's chair.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And all at once, as there we sat, we heard<br>  A cracking and a riving of the roofs,<br>  And rending, and a blast, and overhead<br>  Thunder, and in the thunder was a cry.<br>  And in the blast there smote along the hall<br>  A beam of light seven times more clear than day:<br>  And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail<br>  All over covered with a luminous cloud,<br>  And none might see who bare it, and it past.<br>  But every knight beheld his fellow's face<br>  As in a glory, and all the knights arose,<br>  And staring each at other like dumb men<br>  Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sware a vow before them all, that I,<br>  Because I had not seen the Grail, would ride<br>  A twelvemonth and a day in quest of it,<br>  Until I found and saw it, as the nun<br>  My sister saw it; and Galahad sware the vow,<br>  And good Sir Bors, our Lancelot's cousin, sware,<br>  And Lancelot sware, and many among the knights,<br>  And Gawain sware, and louder than the rest."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake the monk Ambrosius, asking him,<br>  "What said the King? Did Arthur take the vow?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, for my lord," said Percivale, "the King,<br>  Was not in hall: for early that same day,<br>  Scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold,<br>  An outraged maiden sprang into the hall<br>  Crying on help: for all her shining hair<br>  Was smeared with earth, and either milky arm<br>  Red-rent with hooks of bramble, and all she wore<br>  Torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn<br>  In tempest: so the King arose and went<br>  To smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees<br>  That made such honey in his realm. Howbeit<br>  Some little of this marvel he too saw,<br>  Returning o'er the plain that then began<br>  To darken under Camelot; whence the King<br>  Looked up, calling aloud, 'Lo, there! the roofs<br>  Of our great hall are rolled in thunder-smoke!<br>  Pray Heaven, they be not smitten by the bolt.'<br>  For dear to Arthur was that hall of ours,<br>  As having there so oft with all his knights<br>  Feasted, and as the stateliest under heaven.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brother, had you known our mighty hall,<br>  Which Merlin built for Arthur long ago!<br>  For all the sacred mount of Camelot,<br>  And all the dim rich city, roof by roof,<br>  Tower after tower, spire beyond spire,<br>  By grove, and garden-lawn, and rushing brook,<br>  Climbs to the mighty hall that Merlin built.<br>  And four great zones of sculpture, set betwixt<br>  With many a mystic symbol, gird the hall:<br>  And in the lowest beasts are slaying men,<br>  And in the second men are slaying beasts,<br>  And on the third are warriors, perfect men,<br>  And on the fourth are men with growing wings,<br>  And over all one statue in the mould<br>  Of Arthur, made by Merlin, with a crown,<br>  And peaked wings pointed to the Northern Star.<br>  And eastward fronts the statue, and the crown<br>  And both the wings are made of gold, and flame<br>  At sunrise till the people in far fields,<br>  Wasted so often by the heathen hordes,<br>  Behold it, crying, 'We have still a King.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, brother, had you known our hall within,<br>  Broader and higher than any in all the lands!<br>  Where twelve great windows blazon Arthur's wars,<br>  And all the light that falls upon the board<br>  Streams through the twelve great battles of our King.<br>  Nay, one there is, and at the eastern end,<br>  Wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere,<br>  Where Arthur finds the brand Excalibur.<br>  And also one to the west, and counter to it,<br>  And blank: and who shall blazon it? when and how?--<br>  O there, perchance, when all our wars are done,<br>  The brand Excalibur will be cast away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So to this hall full quickly rode the King,<br>  In horror lest the work by Merlin wrought,<br>  Dreamlike, should on the sudden vanish, wrapt<br>  In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.<br>  And in he rode, and up I glanced, and saw<br>  The golden dragon sparkling over all:<br>  And many of those who burnt the hold, their arms<br>  Hacked, and their foreheads grimed with smoke, and seared,<br>  Followed, and in among bright faces, ours,<br>  Full of the vision, prest: and then the King<br>  Spake to me, being nearest, 'Percivale,'<br>  (Because the hall was all in tumult--some<br>  Vowing, and some protesting), 'what is this?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brother, when I told him what had chanced,<br>  My sister's vision, and the rest, his face<br>  Darkened, as I have seen it more than once,<br>  When some brave deed seemed to be done in vain,<br>  Darken; and 'Woe is me, my knights,' he cried,<br>  'Had I been here, ye had not sworn the vow.'<br>  Bold was mine answer, 'Had thyself been here,<br>  My King, thou wouldst have sworn.' 'Yea, yea,' said he,<br>  'Art thou so bold and hast not seen the Grail?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Nay, Lord, I heard the sound, I saw the light,<br>  But since I did not see the Holy Thing,<br>  I sware a vow to follow it till I saw.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then when he asked us, knight by knight, if any<br>  Had seen it, all their answers were as one:<br>  'Nay, Lord, and therefore have we sworn our vows.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Lo now,' said Arthur, 'have ye seen a cloud?<br>  What go ye into the wilderness to see?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then Galahad on the sudden, and in a voice<br>  Shrilling along the hall to Arthur, called<br>  'But I, Sir Arthur, saw the Holy Grail,<br>  I saw the Holy Grail and heard a cry--<br>  "O Galahad, and O Galahad, follow me."'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Ah, Galahad, Galahad,' said the King, 'for such<br>  As thou art is the vision, not for these.<br>  Thy holy nun and thou have seen a sign--<br>  Holier is none, my Percivale, than she--<br>  A sign to maim this Order which I made.<br>  But ye, that follow but the leader's bell'<br>  (Brother, the King was hard upon his knights)<br>  'Taliessin is our fullest throat of song,<br>  And one hath sung and all the dumb will sing.<br>  Lancelot is Lancelot, and hath overborne<br>  Five knights at once, and every younger knight,<br>  Unproven, holds himself as Lancelot,<br>  Till overborne by one, he learns--and ye,<br>  What are ye? Galahads?--no, nor Percivales'<br>  (For thus it pleased the King to range me close<br>  After Sir Galahad); 'nay,' said he, 'but men<br>  With strength and will to right the wronged, of power<br>  To lay the sudden heads of violence flat,<br>  Knights that in twelve great battles splashed and dyed<br>  The strong White Horse in his own heathen blood--<br>  But one hath seen, and all the blind will see.<br>  Go, since your vows are sacred, being made:<br>  Yet--for ye know the cries of all my realm<br>  Pass through this hall--how often, O my knights,<br>  Your places being vacant at my side,<br>  This chance of noble deeds will come and go<br>  Unchallenged, while ye follow wandering fires<br>  Lost in the quagmire! Many of you, yea most,<br>  Return no more: ye think I show myself<br>  Too dark a prophet: come now, let us meet<br>  The morrow morn once more in full field<br>  Of gracious pastime, that once more the King,<br>  Before ye leave him for this Quest, may count<br>  The yet-unbroken strength of all his knights,<br>  Rejoicing in that Order which he made.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So when the sun broke next from under ground,<br>  All the great table of our Arthur closed<br>  And clashed in such a tourney and so full,<br>  So many lances broken--never yet<br>  Had Camelot seen the like, since Arthur came;<br>  And I myself and Galahad, for a strength<br>  Was in us from the vision, overthrew<br>  So many knights that all the people cried,<br>  And almost burst the barriers in their heat,<br>  Shouting, 'Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale!'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when the next day brake from under ground--<br>  O brother, had you known our Camelot,<br>  Built by old kings, age after age, so old<br>  The King himself had fears that it would fall,<br>  So strange, and rich, and dim; for where the roofs<br>  Tottered toward each other in the sky,<br>  Met foreheads all along the street of those<br>  Who watched us pass; and lower, and where the long<br>  Rich galleries, lady-laden, weighed the necks<br>  Of dragons clinging to the crazy walls,<br>  Thicker than drops from thunder, showers of flowers<br>  Fell as we past; and men and boys astride<br>  On wyvern, lion, dragon, griffin, swan,<br>  At all the corners, named us each by name,<br>  Calling 'God speed!' but in the ways below<br>  The knights and ladies wept, and rich and poor<br>  Wept, and the King himself could hardly speak<br>  For grief, and all in middle street the Queen,<br>  Who rode by Lancelot, wailed and shrieked aloud,<br>  'This madness has come on us for our sins.'<br>  So to the Gate of the three Queens we came,<br>  Where Arthur's wars are rendered mystically,<br>  And thence departed every one his way.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I was lifted up in heart, and thought<br>  Of all my late-shown prowess in the lists,<br>  How my strong lance had beaten down the knights,<br>  So many and famous names; and never yet<br>  Had heaven appeared so blue, nor earth so green,<br>  For all my blood danced in me, and I knew<br>  That I should light upon the Holy Grail.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thereafter, the dark warning of our King,<br>  That most of us would follow wandering fires,<br>  Came like a driving gloom across my mind.<br>  Then every evil word I had spoken once,<br>  And every evil thought I had thought of old,<br>  And every evil deed I ever did,<br>  Awoke and cried, 'This Quest is not for thee.'<br>  And lifting up mine eyes, I found myself<br>  Alone, and in a land of sand and thorns,<br>  And I was thirsty even unto death;<br>  And I, too, cried, 'This Quest is not for thee.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And on I rode, and when I thought my thirst<br>  Would slay me, saw deep lawns, and then a brook,<br>  With one sharp rapid, where the crisping white<br>  Played ever back upon the sloping wave,<br>  And took both ear and eye; and o'er the brook<br>  Were apple-trees, and apples by the brook<br>  Fallen, and on the lawns. 'I will rest here,'<br>  I said, 'I am not worthy of the Quest;'<br>  But even while I drank the brook, and ate<br>  The goodly apples, all these things at once<br>  Fell into dust, and I was left alone,<br>  And thirsting, in a land of sand and thorns.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then behold a woman at a door<br>  Spinning; and fair the house whereby she sat,<br>  And kind the woman's eyes and innocent,<br>  And all her bearing gracious; and she rose<br>  Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,<br>  'Rest here;' but when I touched her, lo! she, too,<br>  Fell into dust and nothing, and the house<br>  Became no better than a broken shed,<br>  And in it a dead babe; and also this<br>  Fell into dust, and I was left alone.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And on I rode, and greater was my thirst.<br>  Then flashed a yellow gleam across the world,<br>  And where it smote the plowshare in the field,<br>  The plowman left his plowing, and fell down<br>  Before it; where it glittered on her pail,<br>  The milkmaid left her milking, and fell down<br>  Before it, and I knew not why, but thought<br>  'The sun is rising,' though the sun had risen.<br>  Then was I ware of one that on me moved<br>  In golden armour with a crown of gold<br>  About a casque all jewels; and his horse<br>  In golden armour jewelled everywhere:<br>  And on the splendour came, flashing me blind;<br>  And seemed to me the Lord of all the world,<br>  Being so huge. But when I thought he meant<br>  To crush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,<br>  Opened his arms to embrace me as he came,<br>  And up I went and touched him, and he, too,<br>  Fell into dust, and I was left alone<br>  And wearying in a land of sand and thorns.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I rode on and found a mighty hill,<br>  And on the top, a city walled: the spires<br>  Pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven.<br>  And by the gateway stirred a crowd; and these<br>  Cried to me climbing, 'Welcome, Percivale!<br>  Thou mightiest and thou purest among men!'<br>  And glad was I and clomb, but found at top<br>  No man, nor any voice. And thence I past<br>  Far through a ruinous city, and I saw<br>  That man had once dwelt there; but there I found<br>  Only one man of an exceeding age.<br>  'Where is that goodly company,' said I,<br>  'That so cried out upon me?' and he had<br>  Scarce any voice to answer, and yet gasped,<br>  'Whence and what art thou?' and even as he spoke<br>  Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I<br>  Was left alone once more, and cried in grief,<br>  'Lo, if I find the Holy Grail itself<br>  And touch it, it will crumble into dust.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And thence I dropt into a lowly vale,<br>  Low as the hill was high, and where the vale<br>  Was lowest, found a chapel, and thereby<br>  A holy hermit in a hermitage,<br>  To whom I told my phantoms, and he said:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'O son, thou hast not true humility,<br>  The highest virtue, mother of them all;<br>  For when the Lord of all things made Himself<br>  Naked of glory for His mortal change,<br>  "Take thou my robe," she said, "for all is thine,"<br>  And all her form shone forth with sudden light<br>  So that the angels were amazed, and she<br>  Followed Him down, and like a flying star<br>  Led on the gray-haired wisdom of the east;<br>  But her thou hast not known: for what is this<br>  Thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?<br>  Thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself<br>  As Galahad.' When the hermit made an end,<br>  In silver armour suddenly Galahad shone<br>  Before us, and against the chapel door<br>  Laid lance, and entered, and we knelt in prayer.<br>  And there the hermit slaked my burning thirst,<br>  And at the sacring of the mass I saw<br>  The holy elements alone; but he,<br>  'Saw ye no more? I, Galahad, saw the Grail,<br>  The Holy Grail, descend upon the shrine:<br>  I saw the fiery face as of a child<br>  That smote itself into the bread, and went;<br>  And hither am I come; and never yet<br>  Hath what thy sister taught me first to see,<br>  This Holy Thing, failed from my side, nor come<br>  Covered, but moving with me night and day,<br>  Fainter by day, but always in the night<br>  Blood-red, and sliding down the blackened marsh<br>  Blood-red, and on the naked mountain top<br>  Blood-red, and in the sleeping mere below<br>  Blood-red. And in the strength of this I rode,<br>  Shattering all evil customs everywhere,<br>  And past through Pagan realms, and made them mine,<br>  And clashed with Pagan hordes, and bore them down,<br>  And broke through all, and in the strength of this<br>  Come victor. But my time is hard at hand,<br>  And hence I go; and one will crown me king<br>  Far in the spiritual city; and come thou, too,<br>  For thou shalt see the vision when I go.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,<br>  Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew<br>  One with him, to believe as he believed.<br>  Then, when the day began to wane, we went.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There rose a hill that none but man could climb,<br>  Scarred with a hundred wintry water-courses--<br>  Storm at the top, and when we gained it, storm<br>  Round us and death; for every moment glanced<br>  His silver arms and gloomed: so quick and thick<br>  The lightnings here and there to left and right<br>  Struck, till the dry old trunks about us, dead,<br>  Yea, rotten with a hundred years of death,<br>  Sprang into fire: and at the base we found<br>  On either hand, as far as eye could see,<br>  A great black swamp and of an evil smell,<br>  Part black, part whitened with the bones of men,<br>  Not to be crost, save that some ancient king<br>  Had built a way, where, linked with many a bridge,<br>  A thousand piers ran into the great Sea.<br>  And Galahad fled along them bridge by bridge,<br>  And every bridge as quickly as he crost<br>  Sprang into fire and vanished, though I yearned<br>  To follow; and thrice above him all the heavens<br>  Opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed<br>  Shoutings of all the sons of God: and first<br>  At once I saw him far on the great Sea,<br>  In silver-shining armour starry-clear;<br>  And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung<br>  Clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud.<br>  And with exceeding swiftness ran the boat,<br>  If boat it were--I saw not whence it came.<br>  And when the heavens opened and blazed again<br>  Roaring, I saw him like a silver star--<br>  And had he set the sail, or had the boat<br>  Become a living creature clad with wings?<br>  And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung<br>  Redder than any rose, a joy to me,<br>  For now I knew the veil had been withdrawn.<br>  Then in a moment when they blazed again<br>  Opening, I saw the least of little stars<br>  Down on the waste, and straight beyond the star<br>  I saw the spiritual city and all her spires<br>  And gateways in a glory like one pearl--<br>  No larger, though the goal of all the saints--<br>  Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot<br>  A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there<br>  Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail,<br>  Which never eyes on earth again shall see.<br>  Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep.<br>  And how my feet recrost the deathful ridge<br>  No memory in me lives; but that I touched<br>  The chapel-doors at dawn I know; and thence<br>  Taking my war-horse from the holy man,<br>  Glad that no phantom vext me more, returned<br>  To whence I came, the gate of Arthur's wars."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brother," asked Ambrosius--"for in sooth<br>  These ancient books--and they would win thee--teem,<br>  Only I find not there this Holy Grail,<br>  With miracles and marvels like to these,<br>  Not all unlike; which oftentime I read,<br>  Who read but on my breviary with ease,<br>  Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass<br>  Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,<br>  And almost plastered like a martin's nest<br>  To these old walls--and mingle with our folk;<br>  And knowing every honest face of theirs<br>  As well as ever shepherd knew his sheep,<br>  And every homely secret in their hearts,<br>  Delight myself with gossip and old wives,<br>  And ills and aches, and teethings, lyings-in,<br>  And mirthful sayings, children of the place,<br>  That have no meaning half a league away:<br>  Or lulling random squabbles when they rise,<br>  Chafferings and chatterings at the market-cross,<br>  Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,<br>  Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs--<br>  O brother, saving this Sir Galahad,<br>  Came ye on none but phantoms in your quest,<br>  No man, no woman?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sir Percivale:<br>  "All men, to one so bound by such a vow,<br>  And women were as phantoms. O, my brother,<br>  Why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee<br>  How far I faltered from my quest and vow?<br>  For after I had lain so many nights,<br>  A bedmate of the snail and eft and snake,<br>  In grass and burdock, I was changed to wan<br>  And meagre, and the vision had not come;<br>  And then I chanced upon a goodly town<br>  With one great dwelling in the middle of it;<br>  Thither I made, and there was I disarmed<br>  By maidens each as fair as any flower:<br>  But when they led me into hall, behold,<br>  The Princess of that castle was the one,<br>  Brother, and that one only, who had ever<br>  Made my heart leap; for when I moved of old<br>  A slender page about her father's hall,<br>  And she a slender maiden, all my heart<br>  Went after her with longing: yet we twain<br>  Had never kissed a kiss, or vowed a vow.<br>  And now I came upon her once again,<br>  And one had wedded her, and he was dead,<br>  And all his land and wealth and state were hers.<br>  And while I tarried, every day she set<br>  A banquet richer than the day before<br>  By me; for all her longing and her will<br>  Was toward me as of old; till one fair morn,<br>  I walking to and fro beside a stream<br>  That flashed across her orchard underneath<br>  Her castle-walls, she stole upon my walk,<br>  And calling me the greatest of all knights,<br>  Embraced me, and so kissed me the first time,<br>  And gave herself and all her wealth to me.<br>  Then I remembered Arthur's warning word,<br>  That most of us would follow wandering fires,<br>  And the Quest faded in my heart. Anon,<br>  The heads of all her people drew to me,<br>  With supplication both of knees and tongue:<br>  'We have heard of thee: thou art our greatest knight,<br>  Our Lady says it, and we well believe:<br>  Wed thou our Lady, and rule over us,<br>  And thou shalt be as Arthur in our land.'<br>  O me, my brother! but one night my vow<br>  Burnt me within, so that I rose and fled,<br>  But waild and wept, and hated mine own self,<br>  And even the Holy Quest, and all but her;<br>  Then after I was joined with Galahad<br>  Cared not for her, nor anything upon earth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the monk, "Poor men, when yule is cold,<br>  Must be content to sit by little fires.<br>  And this am I, so that ye care for me<br>  Ever so little; yea, and blest be Heaven<br>  That brought thee here to this poor house of ours<br>  Where all the brethren are so hard, to warm<br>  My cold heart with a friend: but O the pity<br>  To find thine own first love once more--to hold,<br>  Hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms,<br>  Or all but hold, and then--cast her aside,<br>  Foregoing all her sweetness, like a weed.<br>  For we that want the warmth of double life,<br>  We that are plagued with dreams of something sweet<br>  Beyond all sweetness in a life so rich,--<br>  Ah, blessed Lord, I speak too earthlywise,<br>  Seeing I never strayed beyond the cell,<br>  But live like an old badger in his earth,<br>  With earth about him everywhere, despite<br>  All fast and penance. Saw ye none beside,<br>  None of your knights?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea so," said Percivale:<br>  "One night my pathway swerving east, I saw<br>  The pelican on the casque of our Sir Bors<br>  All in the middle of the rising moon:<br>  And toward him spurred, and hailed him, and he me,<br>  And each made joy of either; then he asked,<br>  'Where is he? hast thou seen him--Lancelot?-- Once,'<br>  Said good Sir Bors, 'he dashed across me--mad,<br>  And maddening what he rode: and when I cried,<br>  "Ridest thou then so hotly on a quest<br>  So holy," Lancelot shouted, "Stay me not!<br>  I have been the sluggard, and I ride apace,<br>  For now there is a lion in the way."<br>  So vanished.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then Sir Bors had ridden on<br>  Softly, and sorrowing for our Lancelot,<br>  Because his former madness, once the talk<br>  And scandal of our table, had returned;<br>  For Lancelot's kith and kin so worship him<br>  That ill to him is ill to them; to Bors<br>  Beyond the rest: he well had been content<br>  Not to have seen, so Lancelot might have seen,<br>  The Holy Cup of healing; and, indeed,<br>  Being so clouded with his grief and love,<br>  Small heart was his after the Holy Quest:<br>  If God would send the vision, well: if not,<br>  The Quest and he were in the hands of Heaven.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors<br>  Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm,<br>  And found a people there among their crags,<br>  Our race and blood, a remnant that were left<br>  Paynim amid their circles, and the stones<br>  They pitch up straight to heaven: and their wise men<br>  Were strong in that old magic which can trace<br>  The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him<br>  And this high Quest as at a simple thing:<br>  Told him he followed--almost Arthur's words--<br>  A mocking fire: 'what other fire than he,<br>  Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows,<br>  And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?'<br>  And when his answer chafed them, the rough crowd,<br>  Hearing he had a difference with their priests,<br>  Seized him, and bound and plunged him into a cell<br>  Of great piled stones; and lying bounden there<br>  In darkness through innumerable hours<br>  He heard the hollow-ringing heavens sweep<br>  Over him till by a miracle--what else?--<br>  Heavy as it was, a great stone slipt and fell,<br>  Such as no wind could move: and through the gap<br>  Glimmered the streaming scud: then came a night<br>  Still as the day was loud; and through the gap<br>  The seven clear stars of Arthur's Table Round--<br>  For, brother, so one night, because they roll<br>  Through such a round in heaven, we named the stars,<br>  Rejoicing in ourselves and in our King--<br>  And these, like bright eyes of familiar friends,<br>  In on him shone: 'And then to me, to me,'<br>  Said good Sir Bors, 'beyond all hopes of mine,<br>  Who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself--<br>  Across the seven clear stars--O grace to me--<br>  In colour like the fingers of a hand<br>  Before a burning taper, the sweet Grail<br>  Glided and past, and close upon it pealed<br>  A sharp quick thunder.' Afterwards, a maid,<br>  Who kept our holy faith among her kin<br>  In secret, entering, loosed and let him go."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the monk: "And I remember now<br>  That pelican on the casque: Sir Bors it was<br>  Who spake so low and sadly at our board;<br>  And mighty reverent at our grace was he:<br>  A square-set man and honest; and his eyes,<br>  An out-door sign of all the warmth within,<br>  Smiled with his lips--a smile beneath a cloud,<br>  But heaven had meant it for a sunny one:<br>  Ay, ay, Sir Bors, who else? But when ye reached<br>  The city, found ye all your knights returned,<br>  Or was there sooth in Arthur's prophecy,<br>  Tell me, and what said each, and what the King?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered Percivale: "And that can I,<br>  Brother, and truly; since the living words<br>  Of so great men as Lancelot and our King<br>  Pass not from door to door and out again,<br>  But sit within the house. O, when we reached<br>  The city, our horses stumbling as they trode<br>  On heaps of ruin, hornless unicorns,<br>  Cracked basilisks, and splintered cockatrices,<br>  And shattered talbots, which had left the stones<br>  Raw, that they fell from, brought us to the hall.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there sat Arthur on the da&iuml;s-throne,<br>  And those that had gone out upon the Quest,<br>  Wasted and worn, and but a tithe of them,<br>  And those that had not, stood before the King,<br>  Who, when he saw me, rose, and bad me hail,<br>  Saying, 'A welfare in thine eye reproves<br>  Our fear of some disastrous chance for thee<br>  On hill, or plain, at sea, or flooding ford.<br>  So fierce a gale made havoc here of late<br>  Among the strange devices of our kings;<br>  Yea, shook this newer, stronger hall of ours,<br>  And from the statue Merlin moulded for us<br>  Half-wrenched a golden wing; but now--the Quest,<br>  This vision--hast thou seen the Holy Cup,<br>  That Joseph brought of old to Glastonbury?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So when I told him all thyself hast heard,<br>  Ambrosius, and my fresh but fixt resolve<br>  To pass away into the quiet life,<br>  He answered not, but, sharply turning, asked<br>  Of Gawain, 'Gawain, was this Quest for thee?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Nay, lord,' said Gawain, 'not for such as I.<br>  Therefore I communed with a saintly man,<br>  Who made me sure the Quest was not for me;<br>  For I was much awearied of the Quest:<br>  But found a silk pavilion in a field,<br>  And merry maidens in it; and then this gale<br>  Tore my pavilion from the tenting-pin,<br>  And blew my merry maidens all about<br>  With all discomfort; yea, and but for this,<br>  My twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He ceased; and Arthur turned to whom at first<br>  He saw not, for Sir Bors, on entering, pushed<br>  Athwart the throng to Lancelot, caught his hand,<br>  Held it, and there, half-hidden by him, stood,<br>  Until the King espied him, saying to him,<br>  'Hail, Bors! if ever loyal man and true<br>  Could see it, thou hast seen the Grail;' and Bors,<br>  'Ask me not, for I may not speak of it:<br>  I saw it;' and the tears were in his eyes.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then there remained but Lancelot, for the rest<br>  Spake but of sundry perils in the storm;<br>  Perhaps, like him of Cana in Holy Writ,<br>  Our Arthur kept his best until the last;<br>  'Thou, too, my Lancelot,' asked the King, 'my friend,<br>  Our mightiest, hath this Quest availed for thee?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Our mightiest!' answered Lancelot, with a groan;<br>  'O King!'--and when he paused, methought I spied<br>  A dying fire of madness in his eyes--<br>  'O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be,<br>  Happier are those that welter in their sin,<br>  Swine in mud, that cannot see for slime,<br>  Slime of the ditch: but in me lived a sin<br>  So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure,<br>  Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung<br>  Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower<br>  And poisonous grew together, each as each,<br>  Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights<br>  Sware, I sware with them only in the hope<br>  That could I touch or see the Holy Grail<br>  They might be plucked asunder. Then I spake<br>  To one most holy saint, who wept and said,<br>  That save they could be plucked asunder, all<br>  My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed<br>  That I would work according as he willed.<br>  And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove<br>  To tear the twain asunder in my heart,<br>  My madness came upon me as of old,<br>  And whipt me into waste fields far away;<br>  There was I beaten down by little men,<br>  Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword<br>  And shadow of my spear had been enow<br>  To scare them from me once; and then I came<br>  All in my folly to the naked shore,<br>  Wide flats, where nothing but coarse grasses grew;<br>  But such a blast, my King, began to blow,<br>  So loud a blast along the shore and sea,<br>  Ye could not hear the waters for the blast,<br>  Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea<br>  Drove like a cataract, and all the sand<br>  Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens<br>  Were shaken with the motion and the sound.<br>  And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat,<br>  Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain;<br>  And in my madness to myself I said,<br>  "I will embark and I will lose myself,<br>  And in the great sea wash away my sin."<br>  I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat.<br>  Seven days I drove along the dreary deep,<br>  And with me drove the moon and all the stars;<br>  And the wind fell, and on the seventh night<br>  I heard the shingle grinding in the surge,<br>  And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up,<br>  Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek,<br>  A castle like a rock upon a rock,<br>  With chasm-like portals open to the sea,<br>  And steps that met the breaker! there was none<br>  Stood near it but a lion on each side<br>  That kept the entry, and the moon was full.<br>  Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs.<br>  There drew my sword. With sudden-flaring manes<br>  Those two great beasts rose upright like a man,<br>  Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between;<br>  And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice,<br>  "Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts<br>  Will tear thee piecemeal." Then with violence<br>  The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell.<br>  And up into the sounding hall I past;<br>  But nothing in the sounding hall I saw,<br>  No bench nor table, painting on the wall<br>  Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon<br>  Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea.<br>  But always in the quiet house I heard,<br>  Clear as a lark, high o'er me as a lark,<br>  A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower<br>  To the eastward: up I climbed a thousand steps<br>  With pain: as in a dream I seemed to climb<br>  For ever: at the last I reached a door,<br>  A light was in the crannies, and I heard,<br>  "Glory and joy and honour to our Lord<br>  And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail."<br>  Then in my madness I essayed the door;<br>  It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat<br>  As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I,<br>  Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was,<br>  With such a fierceness that I swooned away--<br>  O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail,<br>  All palled in crimson samite, and around<br>  Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes.<br>  And but for all my madness and my sin,<br>  And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw<br>  That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled<br>  And covered; and this Quest was not for me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So speaking, and here ceasing, Lancelot left<br>  The hall long silent, till Sir Gawain-- nay,<br>  Brother, I need not tell thee foolish words,--<br>  A reckless and irreverent knight was he,<br>  Now boldened by the silence of his King,--<br>  Well, I will tell thee: 'O King, my liege,' he said,<br>  'Hath Gawain failed in any quest of thine?<br>  When have I stinted stroke in foughten field?<br>  But as for thine, my good friend Percivale,<br>  Thy holy nun and thou have driven men mad,<br>  Yea, made our mightiest madder than our least.<br>  But by mine eyes and by mine ears I swear,<br>  I will be deafer than the blue-eyed cat,<br>  And thrice as blind as any noonday owl,<br>  To holy virgins in their ecstacies,<br>  Henceforward.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Deafer,' said the blameless King,<br>  'Gawain, and blinder unto holy things<br>  Hope not to make thyself by idle vows,<br>  Being too blind to have desire to see.<br>  But if indeed there came a sign from heaven,<br>  Blessed are Bors, Lancelot and Percivale,<br>  For these have seen according to their sight.<br>  For every fiery prophet in old times,<br>  And all the sacred madness of the bard,<br>  When God made music through them, could but speak<br>  His music by the framework and the chord;<br>  And as ye saw it ye have spoken truth.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Nay--but thou errest, Lancelot: never yet<br>  Could all of true and noble in knight and man<br>  Twine round one sin, whatever it might be,<br>  With such a closeness, but apart there grew,<br>  Save that he were the swine thou spakest of,<br>  Some root of knighthood and pure nobleness;<br>  Whereto see thou, that it may bear its flower.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'And spake I not too truly, O my knights?<br>  Was I too dark a prophet when I said<br>  To those who went upon the Holy Quest,<br>  That most of them would follow wandering fires,<br>  Lost in the quagmire?--lost to me and gone,<br>  And left me gazing at a barren board,<br>  And a lean Order--scarce returned a tithe--<br>  And out of those to whom the vision came<br>  My greatest hardly will believe he saw;<br>  Another hath beheld it afar off,<br>  And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,<br>  Cares but to pass into the silent life.<br>  And one hath had the vision face to face,<br>  And now his chair desires him here in vain,<br>  However they may crown him otherwhere.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'And some among you held, that if the King<br>  Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:<br>  Not easily, seeing that the King must guard<br>  That which he rules, and is but as the hind<br>  To whom a space of land is given to plow.<br>  Who may not wander from the allotted field<br>  Before his work be done; but, being done,<br>  Let visions of the night or of the day<br>  Come, as they will; and many a time they come,<br>  Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,<br>  This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,<br>  This air that smites his forehead is not air<br>  But vision--yea, his very hand and foot--<br>  In moments when he feels he cannot die,<br>  And knows himself no vision to himself,<br>  Nor the high God a vision, nor that One<br>  Who rose again: ye have seen what ye have seen.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So spake the king: I knew not all he meant."<br>
