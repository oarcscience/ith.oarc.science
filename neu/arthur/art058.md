## THE LAST BALLAD

### by

## JOHN DAVIDSON

  
  
By coasts where scalding deserts reek,  
   The apanages of despair;  
In outland wilds, by firth and creek,  
   O'er icy bournes of silver air;  
  
In storm or calm delaying not,  
   To every noble task addressed,  
Year after year, Sir Lancelot  
   Fulfilled King Arthur's high behest.  
  
He helped the helpless ones; withstood  
   Tyrants and sanctioners of vice;  
He rooted out the dragon brood,  
   And overthrew false deities.  
  
Alone with his own soul, alone  
   With life and death, with day and night,  
His thought and strength grew great and shone  
   A tongue of flame, a sword of light.  
  
And yet not all alone. On high,  
   When midnight set the spaces free,  
And brimming stars hung from the sky  
   Low down, and spilt their jewellery,  
  
Behind the nightly squandered fire,  
   Through a dark lattice only seen  
By love, a look of rapt desire  
   Fell from a vision of the Queen.  
  
From heaven she bent when twilight knit  
   The dusky air and earth in one;  
He saw her like a goddess sit  
   Enthroned upon the noonday sun.  
  
In passages of gulfs and sounds,  
   When wild winds dug the sailor's grave,  
When clouds and billows merged their bounds,  
   And the keel climbed the slippery wave,  
  
A sweet sigh laced the tempest; nay,  
   Low at his ear he heard her speak;  
Among the hurtling sheaves of spray  
   Her loosened tresses swept his cheek.  
  
And in the revelry of death,  
   If human greed of slaughter cast  
Remorse aside, a violet breath,  
   The incense of her being passed  
  
Across his soul, and deeply swayed  
   The fount of pity; o'er the strife  
He curbed the lightning of his blade,  
   And gave the foe his forfeit life.  
  
Low on the heath, or on the deck,  
   In bloody mail or wet with brine,  
Asleep he saw about her neck  
   The wreath of gold and rubies shine;  
  
He saw her brows, her lovelit face,  
   And on her cheek one passionate tear;  
He felt in dreams the rich embrace,  
   The beating heart of Guinevere.  
  
"Visions that haunt my couch, my path,  
   Although the waste, unfathomed sea  
Should rise against me white with wrath  
   I must behold her verily,  
  
"Once ere I die," he said, and turned  
   Westward his faded silken sails  
From isles where cloudy mountains burned,  
   And north to Severn-watered Wales.  
  
Beside the Usk King Arthur kept  
   His Easter court, a glittering rout.  
But Lancelot, because there swept  
   A passion of despair throughout  
  
His being, when he saw once more  
   The sky that canopied, the tide  
That girdled Guinevere, forebore  
   His soul's desire, and wandered wide  
  
In unknown seas companionless,  
   Eating his heart, until by chance  
He drifted into Lyonesse,  
   The wave-worn kingdom of romance.  
  
He leapt ashore and watched his barque  
   Unmastered stagger to its doom;  
Then doffed his arms and fled baresark  
   Into the forest's beckoning gloom.  
  
The exceeding anguish of his mind  
   Had broken him. "King Arthur's trust,"  
He cried; "ignoble, fateful, blind!  
   Her love and my love, noxious lust!  
  
"Dupes of our senses! Let us eat  
   In caverns fathoms underground,  
Alone, ashamed! To sit at meat  
   In jocund throngs?--the most profound  
  
"Device of life the mountebank,  
   Vendor of gilded ashes! Steal  
From every sight to use the rank  
   And loathsome needs that men conceal;  
  
"And crush and drain in curtained beds  
   The clusters called of love; but feed  
With garlanded uplifted heads;  
   Invite the powers that sanction greed  
  
"To countenance the revel; boast  
   Of hunger, thirst; be drunken; claim  
Indulgence to the uttermost,  
   Replenishing the founts of shame!"  
  
He gathered berries, efts, and snails,  
   Sorrel, and new-burst hawthorn leaves;  
Uprooted with his savage nails  
   Earth-nuts; and under rocky eaves  
  
Shamefast devoured them, out of sight  
   In darkness, lest the eye of beast,  
Or bird, or star, or thing of night  
   Uncouth, unknown, should watch him feast.  
  
At noon in twilight depths of pine  
   He heard the word Amaimon spoke;  
He saw the pallid, evil sign  
   The wred-eld lit upon the oak.  
  
The viper loitered in his way;  
   The minx looked up with bloodshot leer;  
Ill-meaning fauns and lamiae  
   With icy laughter flitted near.  
  
But if he came upon a ring  
   Of sinless elves, and crept unseen  
Beneath the brake to hear them sing,  
   And watch them dancing on the green,  
  
They touched earth with their finger-tips;  
   They ceased their roundelay; they laid  
A seal upon their elfin lips  
   And vanished in the purple shade.  
  
At times he rent the dappled flank  
   Of some fair creature of the chase,  
Mumbled its flesh, or growling drank  
   From the still-beating heart, his face  
  
And jowl ruddled, and in his hair  
   And beard, blood-painted straws and burs,  
While eagles barked screening the air,  
   And wolves that were his pensioners.  
  
Sometimes at night his mournful cry  
   Troubled all waking things; the mole  
Dived to his deepest gallery;  
   The vixen from the moonlit knoll  
  
Passed like a shadow underground,  
   And the mad satyr in his lair  
Whined bodeful at the world-old sound  
   Of inarticulate despair.  
  
Sir Lancelot, beloved of men!  
   The ancient earth gat hold of him;  
A year was blotted from his ken  
   In the enchanted forest dim.  
  
At Easter when the thorn beset  
   The bronzing wood with silver sprays,  
And hyacinth and violet  
   Empurpled all the russet ways;  
  
When buttercup and daffodil  
   A stainless treasure-trove unrolled,  
And cowslips had begun to fill  
   Their chalices with sweeter gold,  
  
He heard a sound of summer rush  
   By swarthy grove and kindled lawn;  
He heard, he sighed to hear the thrush  
   Singing alone before the dawn.  
  
Forward he stalked with eyes on fire  
   Like one who keeps in sound and sight  
An angel with celestial lyre  
   Descanting rapturous delight.  
  
He left behind the spell-bound wood;  
   He saw the branchless air unfurled;  
He climbed a hill and trembling stood  
   Above the prospect of the world.  
  
With lustre in its bosom pent  
   From many a shining summer day  
And harvest moon, the wan sea leant  
   Against a heaven of iron-grey.  
  
Inland on the horizon beat  
   And flickered, drooping heavily,  
A fervid haze, a vaporous heat,  
   The dusky eyelid of the sky.  
  
White ways, white gables, russet thatch  
   Fretted the green and purple plain;  
The herd undid his woven latch;  
   The bleating flock went forth again;  
  
The skylarks uttered lauds and prime;  
   The sheep-bells rang from hill to hill;  
The cuckoo pealed his mellow chime;  
   The orient bore a burden shrill.  
  
His memory struggled half awake;  
   Dimly he groped within to see  
What star, what sun, what light should break  
   And set his darkened spirit free.  
  
But from without deliverance came:  
   Afar he saw a horseman speed,  
A knight, a spirit clad in flame  
   Riding upon a milkwhite steed.  
  
For now the sun had quenched outright  
   The clouds and all their working charms,  
Marshalled his legionary light,  
   And fired the rider's golden arms.  
  
Softly the silver billows flowed;  
   Beneath the hill the emerald vale  
Dipped seaward; on the burnished road  
   The milkwhite steed, the dazzling mail  
  
Advanced and flamed against the wind;  
   And Lancelot, his body rent  
With the fierce trial of his mind  
   To know, reeled down the steep descent.  
  
Remembrances of battle plied  
   His soul with ruddy beams of day.  
"A horse! a lance! to arms!" he cried,  
   And stood there weeping in the way.  
  
"Speak!" said the knight. "What man are you?"  
   "I know not yet. Surely of old  
I rode in arms, and fought and slew  
   In jousts and battles manifold."  
  
Oh, wistfully he drew anear,  
   Fingered the reins, the jewelled sheath;  
With rigid hand he grasped the spear,  
   And shuddering whispered, "Life and death,  
  
"Love, lofty deeds, renown--did these  
   Attend me once in days unknown?"  
With courtesy, with comely ease,  
   And brows that like his armour shone,  
  
The golden knight dismounting took  
   Sir Lancelot by the hand and said,  
"Your voice of woe, your lonely look  
   As of a dead man whom the dead  
  
"Themselves cast out--whence are they, friend?"  
   Sir Lancelot a moment hung  
In doubt, then knelt and made an end  
   Of all his madness, tensely strung  
  
In one last effort to be free  
   Of evil things that wait for men  
In secret, strangle memory,  
   And shut the soul up in their den.  
  
"Spirit," he said, "I know your eyes:  
   They bridge with light the heavy drift  
Of years. . . . A woman said, 'Arise;  
   And if you love the Queen, be swift!'  
  
"The token was an emerald chased  
   In gold, once mine. Wherefore I rode  
At dead of night in proudest haste  
   To Payarne where the Queen abode.  
  
"A crafty witch gave me to drink:  
   Almost till undern of the morn  
Silent, in darkness. . . . When I think  
   It was not Guinevere, self-scorn  
  
"Cuts to the marrow of my bones,  
   A blade of fire. Can wisdom yield  
No mood, no counsel, that atones  
   For wasted love! . . . Heaven had revealed  
  
"That she should bear a child to me  
   My bed-mate said. . . . Yet am I mad?  
The offspring of that treachery!  
   The maiden kngiht! You--Galahad,  
  
"My son, who make my trespass dear!"  
   His look released his father's thought--  
The darkling orbs of Guinevere;  
   For so had Lancelot's passion wrought.  
  
With tenderer tears than women shed  
   Sir Galahad held his father fast.  
"Now I shall be your squire," he said.  
   But Lancelot fought him long. At last  
  
The maiden gently overpowered  
   The man. Upon his milkwhite steed  
He brought him where a castle towered  
   Midmost a green enamelled mead;  
  
And clothed his body, clothed his heart  
   In human garniture once more.  
"My father, bid me now depart.  
   I hear beside the clanging shore,  
  
"Above the storm, or in the wind,  
   Outland, or on the old Roman street,  
A chord of music intertwined  
   From wandering tones deep-hued and sweet.  
  
"Afar or near, at noon, at night,  
   The braided sound attends and fills  
My soul with peace, as heaven with light  
   O'erflows when morning crowns the hills.  
  
"And with the music, seen or hid,  
   A blood-rose on the palace lawn,  
A fount of crimson, dark amid  
   The stains and glories of the dawn;  
  
"Above the city's earthly hell  
   A token ominous of doom,  
A cup on fire and terrible  
   With thunders in its ruddy womb;  
  
"But o'er the hamlet's fragrant smoke,  
   The dance and song at eventide,  
A beating heart, the gentle yoke  
   Of life the bridegroom gives the bride;  
  
"A ruby shadow on the snow;  
   A flower, a lamp--through every veil  
And mutable device I know,  
   And follow still the Holy Grail  
  
"Until God gives me my new name  
   Empyreal, and the quest be done."  
Then like a spirit clad in flame,  
   He kissed his father and was gone.  
  
Long gazed Sir Lancelot on the ground  
   Tormented till benign repose  
Enveloped him in depths profound  
   Of sweet oblivion. When he rose  
  
The bitterest was past. "And I  
   Shall follow now the Holy Grail,  
Seen, or unseen, until I die:  
   My very purpose shall avail  
  
"My soul," he said. By day, by night,  
   He rode abroad, his vizor up;  
With sun and moon his vehement sight  
   Fought for a vision of the cup--  
  
In vain. For evermore on high  
   When darkness set the spaces free,  
And brimming stars hung from the sky  
   Low down, and spilt their jewellery,  
  
Behind the nightly squandered fire,  
   Through a dim lattice only seen  
By love, a look of rapt desire  
   Fell from a vision of the Queen.  
  
From heaven she bent when twilight knit  
   The dusky air and earth in one;  
He saw her like a goddess sit  
   Enthroned upon the noonday sun.  
  
Wherefore he girt himself again:  
   In lawless towns and savage lands,  
He overthrew unrighteous men,  
   Accomplishing the King's commands.  
  
In passages of gulfs and sounds  
   When wild winds dug the sailor's grave,  
When clouds and billows merged their bounds,  
   And the keel climbed the slippery wave,  
  
A sweet sigh laced the tempest; nay,  
   Low at his ear he heard her speak;  
Among the hurtling sheaves of spray  
   Her loosened tresses swept his cheek.  
  
And in the revelry of death,  
   If human greed of slaughter cast  
Remorse aside, a violet breath,  
   The incense of her being passed  
  
Across his soul, and deeply swayed  
   The fount of pity; o'er the strife  
He curbed the lightning of his blade,  
   And gave the foe his forfeit life.  
  
His love, in utter woe annealed,  
   Escaped the furnace, sweet and clear--  
His love that on the world had sealed  
   The look, the soul of Guinevere.
