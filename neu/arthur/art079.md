## THE OPERA OF OPERAS; OR, TOM THUMB THE GREAT ALTER'D FROM THE LIFE AND DEATH OF TOM THUMB THE GREAT And Set to Musick after the Italian Manner. As it is Performing at the New Theatre in the Hay-Market

## ELIZA HAYWOOD AND WILLIAM HATCHETT

  
  

THE ARGUMENT.

  
TOM THUMB was the Son of *Gaffer Thumb* , tho' some Authors assert,
*Thumb* was not the Father's Name, but a Sirname given the Son from the
Diminitiveness of his Stature, agreeable to a Wish his Parents made,
that they might have a Son and Heir, tho' he were no bigger than their
*Thumb* . Like another *Homer* , his Birth is much contended, and many
claim the Honour of it. Some will have him of *German* Extraction,
Others of *French* , but the most received Opinion is, that he was an
*Englishman* , born of very honest, but simple Parents, living in the
Reign of King *Arthur* , a *British* Monarch of the sixth Century, who
was Chief General against the *Saxons* ; but whether ever *Arthur*
existed, is a Point much controverted.  
     However that be, *Tom Thumb* is the Hero of the subsequent Opera,
and Favourite of *Arthur* . He returns about this Time from the Wars,
leading a Captive Giantess in Triumph. The King gives him a most
gracious Reception, and in Recompence of his signal Services, bestows on
him his Daughter the Princess *Huncamunca* in Marriage. At the same
Time, his Majesty conceives a violent Passion for the fair Captive
*Glumdalca* , whose Heart is already devoted to *Tom Thumb* . The Queen,
who is likewise enamour'd of the Generalissimo *Thumb* , strenuously
opposes the Match agreed to by the King, upon which a great Quarrel
arises between their Majesties. On the other Hand, Lord *Grizzle* , a
Courtier, is passionately fond of the Princess *Huncamunca* , whose
Pretensions her Majesty seems to cherish, as a Means to frustrate the
intended Nuptials, and thereby gratify her own Inclinations; but
perceiving her Policy of espousing his Interest does not answer her
Design, but on the contrary, adds Fewel to the enflam'd *Grizzle* , and
makes him breathe nothing but Destruction on his Rival, she immediately
breaks with *Grizzle* ; who, in Return, vows Revenge on *Thumb* , and
also threatens to involve the Nation in the Disappointment of his
Love.  
      *Tom Thumb* is not content to gain Glory only in the Field, but he
likewise gives a singular Mark of Prowess, and Heroick Virtue, soon
after his Arrival; for his Friend *Noodle* being arrested, he gallantly
assails the Bailiff, and triumphant kills both him and his Follower.  
      *Thumb's* intended Spouse being of a Disposition, apt for the
State of Matrimony, appears in a very sad, and languishing Condition,
till the Proposition the King her Royal Father makes of a Husband, when
her heavy Melancholy soon dissipates, and she is transported beyond
Expression with the Idea of changing her Condition. Lord *Grizzle*
paying his Respects at this Juncture, she faintly rejects his Suit,
alledging her being promis'd to *Thumb* ; and *Grizzle* using the
Rhetorick of a slighted Lover, detracting from his Rival's Merit, but
above all urging his Insufficiency, she is overcome by his prevailing
Arguments, and gives her Consent to marry him privately. Wing'd with the
high Thoughts of Possession, *Grizzle* flies to fetch the Licence. In
the mean Time *Tom Thumb* waits on the Princess to commence his
Courtship. He makes some amorous Speeches, but is told by her Highness,
that she is promis'd to another. *Glumdalca* , who thinks herself
injur'd in her Love by *Huncamunca* , enters at this Crisis, and a Scene
of Contention between the two fair Rivals ensues, but *Glumdalca* is
defeated, *Tom* giving his Preference to *Huncamunca* . *Glumdalca* is
left full of Fury and Resentment. The King, like a solitary Lover,
throws himself in her Way, which occasions a Scene of Groans, finely
wrought up.  
      *Tom Thumb* , who a little before found the Princess wavering in
her Love, has now remov'd all her late Difficulties, and the Ceremony is
perform'd, which puts an End to a Lover's Anxieties. *Huncamunca* soon
after sees *Grizzle* , and tells thim that, rather than incur his
Displeasure, she will marry him likewise; but the incens'd *Grizzle*
rejects the Proposal with the greatest Contempt, and vows Destruction on
*Thumb* , and the whole Kingdom, which puts *Huncamunca* in a terrible
Pannick.  
     The Ghost of Gaffer *Thumb* appears to *Arthur* , who is foretold
of the Rebellion of *Grizzle* . The Queen having some Presage of this in
her Sleep, quits her Bed in Search of *Arthur* , when a Messenger
arrives, who informs their Majesties that *Grizzle* is in Arms. *Tom
Thumb* is appointed to go against him. *Grizzle* with the Rebels appear.
*Tom Thumb* marching in Pursuit of them, is told by *Merlin* the Manner
of his being begot, and withal shews him his Fate. The two Armies come
to an Engagement. *Glumdalca* is slain by *Grizzle* , and he by *Tom
Thumb* . The King causes Rejoicings to be made on this Success, but in
the midst, a Messenger arrives, that brings Word of *Tom Thumb* 's being
devour'd by a huge Red Cow, as he was bearing off *Grizle* 's Head to
his Majesty. This News puts a Damp on the King's Liberality, and he is
much in Wrath. The Queen stabs the Messenger, and like Children at the
Play of *Strike your next Neighbour* , etc. they stab at one another all
round.  
     But this Scene of Horror is soon transform'd. *Tom Thumb* by
Conjuration, is emitted from the Belly of the Cow, and all the rest are
rais'd to Life again, by Virtue of *Merlin* 's Wand, in perfect Harmony
with each other.

ACT I. SCENE I.  
SCENE, *The Palace* .  
*  
Enter* Doodle, and Noodle.  
  
RECITATIVO.  
  
**Doodle** . Sure, such a day was never seen!  
The sun himself on this harmonious day,  
Shines like a beau in a new birthday suit;  
All nature wears one universal grin.  
**Noodle.** This day, O *Doodle!* doubtless is a day,  
A day we never saw before.  
The mighty *Thumb* , call'd *Tom* , victorious comes;  
Millions of *Giants* , like as many *Bees* ,  
Swarm round his chariot wheels,  
*Giants!* to whom the *Giants* in *Guild Hall*  
Are fools, are infant dwarfs.  
They frown, they foam, they roar, while *Tom* ,  
Regardless of their din, rides on.  
  
                           AIR I.  
      *So the* Cock-Sparrow, *at barn-door,  
     Huge flocks of* Turkeys *hops before;  
     The lubberd* Red-Heads *does despise,  
     Nor at their noisy gugling flies.  
  
* **Doodle. ** 'Tis whisper'd in the books of all our sages,  
This mighty little hero,  
By *Merlin* 's art begot,  
Has not a bone within his skin,  
But is a lump of Gristle.  
**Noodle *.*** Then 'tis a gristle of no mortal kind!  
**Doodle.** Some god, O *Noodle!* stept into the place  
Of gaffer *Thumb* , and more than half begot  
This matchless warriour *Tom* .  
**Noodle** . Sure he was sent express from Heav'n,  
To be the pillar of our state  
Tho' small his carcass be, so very small,  
A chairman's Leg is more than twice as large,  
Yet is his soul like any mountain big,  
And as a mountain once brought forth a mouse,  
So does this mouse contain a mighty mountain.  
**Doodle.** Mountain indeed!  
**Noodle.** But hark!     \[ *Flourish.* \]  
Those trumpets speak the King's approach.  
**Doodle.** He comes most luckily for my petition.  
  
*Enter* King, Queen, Grizzle, *and* Doodle.  
  
**King.** Let nothing but a face of joy appear;  
The man who frowns this day shall lose his head,  
That he may have no face to frown withal.  
Smile *Dollalolla* --ha! what wrinkled sorrow  
Hangs, sits, lies, frowns upon thy knitted brow.  
Whence flow those tears fast down thy blubber'd cheeks,  
Like a swoln gutter, gushing thro' the streets?  
**Queen.** Excess of joy, folks say my lord,  
Gives tears as certain as excess of grief.  
**King.** If it be so, let all men cry for joy,  
'Till my whole Court be drown'd with tears,  
Nay, till they overflow my utmost land,  
And leave me nothing  
But a sea of tears to rule.  
**Doodle.** My liege! I humbly petition--     \[ *Kneeling.* \]  
**King.** Petition me no petitions, Sir, to day;  
Let other hours be set apart for business;  
To day it is our pleasure to be drunk,  
And this our queen shall be as drunk as we.  
**Queen.** Already I am half seas over,  
Yet let the cistern overflow  
With goodRack punch--'fore *George* , I'll see it out--  
Of *Rum* and *Brandy* I'll not taste a drop.  
**King.** Tho' *Rack* in punch 10 *s.* be a quart,  
And *Rum* and *Brandy* be no more than six,  
Rather than quarrel, you shall have your will.  
  
                          AIR II.  
      *When your dames of superior class,  
          Submit to the pow'r of drams,  
     This virtue attends the kind glass,  
          It makes 'em as quiet as lambs.  
     If then without* Brandy, *or* Rum,  
           *Your Wives will not study to please,  
     Let 'em swill till they're tight as a drum  
          Or they'll live the longer to teaze.  
  
* But, ha! the warrior's come--the great *Tom Thumb*      \[
*Trumpets.*  
The little hero-giant killing boy,  
Preserver of my kingdom is arriv'd!  
  
*Enter* Tom Thum.  
  
*With Officers, Prisoners, and Attendants.*  
  
O welcome! most welcome to my arms!  
What gratitude can thank--away the debt,  
Thy valour lays--upon me!  
**Queen.** Oh! ye gods!     \[ *Aside.* \]  
**Thumb.** When I'm not thank'd at all, I'm thank'd enough;  
I've done my duty, and I've done no more.  
**Queen.** Was ever such a god-like creature seen!     \[ *Aside.* \]  
**King.** Thy modesty's a candle to thy merit;  
It shines itself, and shews thy merit too--  
But say, my Boy--  
Where didst thou leave the *Giants* ?  
**Thumb.** My liege, without the castle gates,  
The castle gates too low for their admittance.  
**King.** What look they like?  
**Thumb.** Like nothing but themselves.  
**Queen.** And sure thou'rt like to nothing but thyself.     \[ *Aside.*
\]  
**King.** Enough! the vast idea fills my soul.  
I see them--yes, I see them before me--  
The monstrous, ugly, barb'rous sons of whores!--  
But, ha!  
What finish'd piece of human nature strikes us!  
Sure she was drawn by all the gods in council!  
Who paus'd, and then cry'd out--this is a woman!  
**Thumb.** Then, were the gods mistaken--  
She's not a woman, but a giantess,  
A *High-German* Giantess.  
**Glumdalca.** We yesterday were both a queen and wife;  
One hundred thousand *Giants* own'd our sway,  
Twenty whereof were marry'd to ourself.  
**Queen.** Oh! happy state of giantism!  
  
                         AIR III.  
      *Our Passions are of Giant kind,  
          And have to th' full as large a sense;  
     'Tis hard to one to be confin'd,  
          When with a score we could dispense.*  
  
**Glumdalca.** But then to lose full twenty in one day!  
**Queen.** Madam, believe,  
I view your sorrows with a woman's eye,  
But be as patient as you can,  
To morrow we will have our Grenadiers  
Drawn out before you, when you may chuse  
What Husband you think fit.  
**Glumdalca.** Madam, I am your most obedient Servant.  
**King.** Think, lovely princess, think this court your own,  
Nor think my house an Inn, myself the landlord;  
Call for whate'er you will, you'll nothing pay.  
I feel a sudden pain within my breast;  
Nor know I whether it proceeds from love,  
Or only the wind-cholick--time must shew,      \[ *Aside.* \]  
Oh! *Tom* ! what do we to thy valour owe?  
Ask some reward, great as we can bestow.  
**Thumb.** I ask not kingdoms, I can conquer those;  
I ask not money, money I've enough;  
If what I've done be call'd a debt,  
Take my receipt in full--I ask but this;  
To sun myself in *Huncamunca* 's Eyes.  
**King.** Prodigious bold request!  
**Queen.** Be still my Soul! }     \[ *Aside.* \]  
**Thumb.** My heart is at the threshold of your Mouth,  
And waits it's answer there.  
**King.** It is resolved--the princess is your own.  
**Thumb.** Oh! happy, happy, happy *Thumb* !  
**Queen.** Consider, Sir,--reward your Soldiers merit,  
But give not *Huncamunca* to *Tom Thumb* !  
**King.** *Tom Thumb* !  
Odzooks! my wide extended Realm  
Knows not a name so glorious as *Tom Thumb* !  
  
                    AIR IV  
      *Your* Alexander's, Scipio's,  
           *Inferior are to* Tommy,  
      *While others brag of* Mac's *and* O's,  
           *Let* England *boast of* Thummy.  
  
      *A Title is an empty name,  
          Like many we have knighted;  
     His merit bids us aid his fame,  
          So* Tom *shall not be slighted.  
  
* **Queen.** Tho' greater yet his boasted merit was,  
He shall not have my daughter, that is pos!  
**King.** Ha! sayst thou *Dollalolla?  
* **Queen.** I say he shan't.  
**King.** Then, by our royal self we swear you lie  
**Queen.** Who but a dog--who but a Dog  
Wou'd use me thus?  
But I will be reveng'd, or hang myself.  
  
                         AIR. V.  
      *Then tremble all, who ever weddings made,  
     But tremble more, who did this match perswade;  
     For riding on a Cat, from high I'll fall,  
     And squirt down royal vengeance on you all.*      \[ *Exit*
Queen.  
  
**Doodle.** Her majesty, the queen, is in a passion.  
**King.** Be she, or be she not--now, by ourself  
We were indeed a pretty king of clouts,  
To truckle to our consort's will,  
  
                         AIR VI.  
           *We politic Kings,  
          Know far better things  
     Than e'er to our consorts stoop;  
          For once you give way  
          To Petticoat sway,  
     You may for your Breeches go whoop.*  
  
Come *Thumb* --I'll to the girl, and pave thy way.     \[ *Exeunt all
but* Grizzle.  
**Grizzle.** Where are now thy glories, *Grizzle* ?  
Where are the drums that waken'd thee to honour?  
O, what art thou greatness?  
A lac'd coat from *Monmouth-street* ,  
Worn to day, put on anothers back to-morrow.  
Yesterday as St. *Paul* 's high,  
To day as *Fleet-ditch* low.  
  
*Enter* Queen.  
  
**Queen.** Teach me to scold, oh, *Grizzle* !  
Mountain of treason! ugly as the devil!  
Teach this confounded mouth  
To spout forth words might shame  
All *Billingsgate* to speak.  
**Grizzle.** But first I beg to ask,  
Wherefore my Queen wou'd scold?  
**Queen.** Wherefore? oh! blood and thunder! han't you heard,  
What ev'ry corner of the court resounds,  
That little *Tom* will be a great man made?  
**Grizzle.** I heard it, I confess.  
**Queen.** Odsbobs! I have a mind to hang myself,  
A grand-mother by such a rascal.  
Sure, the King forgets  
His mother put the bastard in a pudding,  
And on a stile was drop'd?  
O, good lord *Grizzle* ! can I bear  
To see him from a pudding mount the throne?  
Or can my *Huncamunca* bear  
To take a pudding's offspring in her arms?  
**Grizzle.** Oh, horror! horror!  
**Queen.** Then rouse thy spirit--we may yet prevent  
This hated Match.  
**Grizzle.** We will, in spite of fate.  
  
                         AIR VII.  
      *The Spaniel, when bid, does obey,  
          And twenty fine tricks shew with all;  
     The Soldier's observant as Tray,  
          And both will come to a call.  
  
     The Lover's more fawning than these,  
          Or any Court Sycophant spark,  
     He'll shoot, fetch, and carry to please,  
          And all for a touch in the dark.  
  
* I'll tear the scoundrel into twenty pieces.  
**Queen.** Oh, no! prevent the match, but hurt him not;  
For tho' I shoud not like him for a son,  
Yet can we kill the man that kill'd the *Giants* ?  
**Grizzle.** I tell you, madam, it was all a trick;  
He made the *Giants* first, and then he kill'd them.  
**Queen.** How! have you seen no *Giants* ? are there not  
Now in the yard, ten thousand proper *Giants* ?  
**Grizzle.** I cannot postively tell,  
But firmly do believe there is not one.  
**Queen.** Hence! from my sight! thou traytor! hie away!  
By all my stars! thou enviest *Tom Thumb* .  
Go, sirrah! go! hie away! hie!  
Thou art a setting dog! begone!  
**Grizzle.** Madam, I go--  
And *Thumb* shall feel the vengeance you have rais'd.  
  
                    AIR VIII.  
      *I'll roar, I'll rant, I'll rave;  
          I'll ride on clouds, thro' seas I'll swim,  
     I'll for the nation dig a grave,  
          And bury it for my whim*      \[ *Exit* Grizzle.  
  
**Queen.** Alack-a-day! oh! whither shall I go?  
I love *Tom Thumb* , but must not tell him so;  
For what's a woman when her virtue's gone?  
A coat that's got no lace-wig out of buckle--  
A stocking with a hole in't--I can't live  
Without my virtue, or *Tom Thumb* :  
Then let me weigh them in two equal scales;  
In this put virtue, that *Tom Thumb* --  
Alas! *Tom Thumb* is heavier than my virtue;  
But hold!--cou'd I prevent the match,  
And shou'd be left a widow,  
Then *Tom Thumb* is mine.  
  
                         AIR IX.  
      *In that dear hope how many live?  
          I'm not the only one;  
     Oh! what wou'd some fine Ladies give  
          To have their husbands gone!  
                    All things new,  
                    Ever wanting;  
                    Joys in view,  
                    More enchanting;  
          'Tis the mode e'er husbands die,  
          To have another in one's Eye.*

**Bailiff.** Come, trusty follower, come on,  
This day stand by me, and at night  
Three double mugs of beer and beer expect--  
This way must *Noodle* pass.  
**Follower.** No more, oh, *Bailiff* ! ev'ry word  
Inspires my soul with virtue.  
Oh. I long to meet the fish, and nab him;  
To lay arresting hands upon his back,  
And nobly drag him to the spunging-house.  
**Bailiff.** Oh! glorious thought!  
But see our prey! let us retire-- *     \[they go aside.*  
  
*Enter* Tom Thumb, *and* Noodle.*  
  
* **Thumb** . O *Noodle* ! I am wondrous sick;  
For tho' I love the gentle *Huncamunca* ,  
Yet at the thought of marriage, I grow pale;  
For oh!--  
**Noodle.** Oh! what?  
**Thumb.** My grand mamma hath often said,  
*Tom Thumb* , beware of marriage!  
**Noodle.** Cou'd you indeed the princess gain without,  
I would not have you marry,  
But Sir, be jealous of old women's sayings,  
If they're against it, 'tis because they're past it.  
Oh! think of all the joy your soul will have.  
While on her panting breast, dissolv'd in bliss,  
You pour out all *Tom Thumb* in every kiss.

Take here your fees--     \[ *draws and stabs 'em both* .

Musick.*  
*Oh* ! Thumb! *Oh* ! *wherefore art thou* Thumb?

**Cleora.** Madam, the King.  
  
*Enter the* King.  
  
**King.** Let all but *Huncamunca* leave the room.     \[ *Exeunt*
Cleora *and* Mustacha.  
Daughter, I have observ'd of late,  
Some Grief unusual in your Countenance.  
Say, what's the Cause?  
Ha'n't you enough of Meat and Drink?  
**Huncamunca.** Alas! my Lord, I value not myself,  
That once I ate two fowls, and half a Pig;  
Small is that Praise; but Oh! a Maid may want,  
What she can neither eat or drink.  
**King.** What's that?  
**Huncamunca.** O spare my Blushes; but I mean a Husband.  
**King.** If that be all, I have provided one;  
A Husband great in Arms,  
Whose Valour, Wisdom, Virtue, make a Noise,  
Great as the Kettle-Drums of twenty Armies.  
**Huncamunca.** Whom does my Royal Fater mean?  
**King.** *Tom Thumb.*  
**Huncamunca.** Is it possible?

\[ *Smiling.*

  
**King.** A Country Dance of Joy is in your Face;  
Your Eyes spit Fire, your Cheeks grow red as Beef.  
**Huncamunca.** Yes, I will own, since licens'd by your Word,  
I'll own *Tom Thumb* the Cause of all my Grief:  
For him I've sighed, I've wept, I've gnaw'd my Sheets.  
**King.** Then thou shalt gnaw thy Holland-Sheets no more,  
A Husband thou shalt have to mumble now.  
**Huncamunca.** O happy Sound.  
  
                         AIR XII.  
      *Long my Maiden head in keeping  
          I have had against my Will;  
     It has cost me much sad weeping,  
          Lest I should lead Apes in Hell.  
     I thank my Stars that Fright is over,  
          I shall try the Marriage-State;  
     Twenty sure deserves a Lover,  
          Or too hard's a Princess' Fate.*  
  
Oh! I am over-joy'd.  
**King.** I see thou art.  
This joyful News shall on our Tonge ride Post,  
And we ourself will bear it to *Tom Thumb* .

Oh! *Huncamunca* ! *Huncamunca* , Oh!  
**Huncamunca.** Ha! What Boldnes' this!  
**\[Grizzle.\]** Yes, Princess, well I know your Rank;  
But Love nor Meanness scorns, nor Grandeur dreads.  
Love often Lords into the Cellar bears,  
And bids as oft the Porter come up-stairs.  
For what's too high for Love, or what too low?  
Oh! *Huncamunca* ! *Huncamunca* , Oh!  
**Huncamunca.** But granting all you say is true,  
                         My Love, alas! is to another due.

One fitter for your Pocket than your Bed?  
Oh! fie! the puny Baby shun,  
Or you will ne'er be brought to Bed of one.

This Instant I renounce my Promise.

**Grizzle.** Ah! sing that o'er again--let the  
sweet Sound attend me as I fly  
to *Doctor's Commons* for a licence.  
**Huncamunca.** O no! lest some Disaster we shou'd meet,  
'Twere better to be marry'd at the *Fleet* .

Where are those Eyes, those Card-matches of Love,  
That light up all with Love my waxen Soul?  
**Huncamunca.** Oh! what is Musick to the Ear that's deaf?  
Or a Goose-Pye to him that has no Taste?  
What are these Praises now to me,  
Since I am promis'd to another?  
**Thumb.** Ha! promis'd?

To be but half so handsome.  
**Huncamunca.** Since you come to that,  
I'll put my Beauty to the Test;  
*Tom Thumb* , I'm thine, if thou wilt go with me.  
**Glumdalca.** O! stay, and thou alone shalt fill  
That Bed wehre twenty Giants us'd to lie.

Ghost.** Hail! ye black horrors of mid-night's mid-noon!  
You *Fairies* , *Goblins* , *Bats* , and *Screech-owls* hail!  
And oh! ye mortal watch-men, whose hoarse throats  
Th' immortal ghosts dread croakings counterfeit,  
All hail!  
  
*Enter* King.  
  
**King.** What noise is this? what villain dares,  
At this dread hour, disturb our royal walls?  
**Ghost.** One who defies thy empty pow'r to hurt him.  
**King.** Presumptuous slave! thou diest!  
**Ghost.** Threat others with that word,  
I am a *Ghost* , and am already dead.  
**King.** Have at thee Man, or *Ghost* --  
Thou fly'st! 'tis well--     \[ *Ghost* retires.\]  
I thought what was the courage of a *Ghost* !  
Yet dare not walk again within these walls  
On pain of the *Red-Sea* ;  
For if henceforth I ever find thee here,  
Sure as a Gun I'll have thee laid.  
**Ghost.** Were the *Red-Sea* , a Sea of *Holland's-Gin* ,  
The liquor, when alive, I did detest,  
Yet for the sake of *Thomas Thumb* ,  
I wou'd be laid therein.  
**King.** Ha! said you?  
**Ghost.** Yes, my liege, I said *Tom Thumb* ,  
Whose Father's Ghost I am,  
Once not unknown to mighty *Arthur* ;

      *I am a civil, friendly sprite,

     I throw not topsy-turvy chairs,  
     Nor tables rumbling down the stairs;  
     Nor yet behind the Wainscot rap,  
     Nor sudden make the casement flap:  
     The doors not jar, nor curtains spread,  
     Nor peep I in at feet of bed.*  
  
**King.** 'Tis he--it is the honest gaffer *Thumb* ,  
Oh! let me press thee in my eager arms,  
Thou best of Ghosts! thou something more than Ghost!  
But say, thou dearest air! oh! say, what dread  
Important business sends thee back to earth?  
**Ghost.** Oh! then prepare to hear--  
Thy Subjects are in arms, by *Grizzle* led,  
Intending to besiege thy royal palace.  
**King.** Thou ly'st, and thy intelligence is false  
Hence--or by all the torments of thy *Hell* ,  
I'll run thee thro' the body, tho' thou hast none.  
**Ghost.** *Arthur* , beware!--I must this moment hence,  
Not frightened by thy voice, but by the cocks.

      *Slight not the warnings of us rambling sprites,

Thus silently from *Dollalolla* 's breast?  
Why dost thou leave me in the dark alone,  
When well thou know'st, I'm so afraid of *Sprites* ,  
I cannot sleep?  
**King.** Prithee, *Dollalolla* , do not blame me;  
I hop'd the fumes of last night's punch had laid  
Thy lovely eye-lids fast--but oh! I find  
There is no pow'r in dreams to quiet wives.  
**Queen.** Think, what must be thy wretched wife's surprise,  
When, stretching-out her arms to hold thee fast,  
She folds her useless Bolster in her arms.  
Think! think on that! oh think! think well on that.  
  
                       AIR XXVI.  
      *In bed we often lie awake,

     When winds are high, and house does shake,

     We simple women, when alone,  
           Are nat'rally afraid;  
     Least motion puts us in a swoon,  
           Except when dear's in bed.*  
  
**King.** Oh! didst thou know one quarter what I know,  
Then wou'dst thou know--alas! what thou wou'dst know?  
**Queen.** What can I gather hence? why dost thou speak  
Like men who carry *Raree-shows* about,  
Now you shall see, gentlemen, what you shall see?  
Oh, tell me more, or thou hast told too much.  
  
*Enter* Noodle.  
  
**Noodle.** Long life attend your Majesties--

And the victorious *Thumb* , without his pate, }  
They are resolv'd to batter down the gate.  
  
*Enter* Huncamunca.  
  
**King.** See, where the princess comes! where is *Tom Thumb* ?  
**Huncamunca.** Oh! Sir, about an hour and a half ago,  
He sallied out to fag the Foe,  
And swore upon his great, his warlike soul,  
He'd make a Grizzle's Head a Nine-pin bowl.  
Come, *Dollalolla* , *Huncamunca* , come,  
Within we'll wait securely for brave *Thumb* .  
Tho' Men and Giants shou'd conspire with Gods,  
Yet he alone is equal to those odds.

While he supports, we need not fear to fall.

     While that's preserv'd, the State may snore,  
           And safely we may spend our Crowns.

For tho' we have not fought, yet we have found  
No enemy to fight withal.  
**Foodle.** And yet, methinks, we'd best avoid this day,  
This first of *April* to engage our foes.  
**Grizzle.** This day, of all the days of the year, I'd chuse;  
God's? I will make *Tom Thumb* an *April* Fool.

Chairmen and porters, hachney-coachmen--whores,  
Aloft he bore the grizly head of *Grizzle* ,  
When on a sudden thro' the streets there came  
A *Cow* , much larger than the usual size,  
And in a moment--Oh! guess the rest  
And in a moment, swallow'd up *Tom Thumb* !  
**King.** Shut up again the prisons--bid my treasurer  
Not give three farthings out--hang all the *Culprits* ,  
Guilty, or not,--no matter--ravish virgins--  
Go bid the school-masters whip all their boys;  
Let lawyers, parsons, and physicians loose  
To rob, impose on, and to kill the world.  
**Noodle.** Her Majesty the Queen is in a swoon.  
**Queen.** Not so much a swoon, but I have still  
Strength to reward the messenger of ill news.     \[ *Stabs him.*  
**Noodle.** Oh! I am slain.  
**Cleora.** My lover's kill'd, and I revenge him so.     \[ *Stabs the
Queen.*  
**Huncamunca.** My mamma kill'd! vile murtheress! there.     \[ *Stabs*
Cleora.  
**Doodle.** This for an old grudge, to thy heart.     \[ *Stabs*
Huncamunca.  
**Mustacha.** And this I drive to thine,  
O *Doodle* for a new one.     \[ *Stabs* Doodle.  
**King.** Ha! murdress vile! take that.     \[ *Stabs* Mustacha.  
And take thou this--     \[ *Kills himself and falls.*  
  
                       AIR XXXII.  
      *A monarch, when his people's gone,  
     Wou'd look but awkward on a throne.  
     With pleasure then resign thy crown,  
     Since all they subjects are o'er thrown.  
     What signifies it to survive,  
     When only thou art left alive?*  
So!  
Oh!     \[ *Dies.*        
  
*Enter Sir* Crit-Operatical *and* Modely.  
  
**Modely.** Well, Sir *Crit-Operatical* , how like you the Entertainment
so far?  
**Sir Crit-Operatical.** Faith, Sir, 'tis as pretty a Banquet of dead
Bodies as a Sexton could wish, and Variety--but I hope Mr. *Modely* has
a better Opinion of the Tenderness, as well as Regularity of my musical
Disposition, than to imagine I can see such a stupid, irregular, and
abominable Catastrophe, without Indignation.  
**Modely.** Have Patience, till you see the Catastrophe.  
**Sir Crit-Operatical.** I would be glad to know who ever saw an
*Italian* Opera end tragically? By Gad, when we *English* imitate any
Thing that's foreign, we do it so awkwardly! There's something of Whim
in the Opera, but split me, this will infallibly damn it in the Eyes of
all good Judges--I could almost cudgel the Rogue, that committed so
unparallel'd a Blunder.  
**Modely.** But good *Sir Crit* , keep your Temper till you see the
Catastrophe.  
**Sir Crit-Operatical.** Catastrophe! Why, the Actors are all dead, and
unless the Author can give them a new Being, he will never be able to
give his Opera another Ending.  
**Modely.** But I hear they are not really dead.  
**Sir Crit-Operatical.** How! not dead?  
**Modely.** No, Sir; they are only inchanted; for you must know,
*Merlin* interpos'd in their Fall, and intends, by Virtue of the same
Magick Art, to make them all rise again, in Order to give a happy
Conclusion to the Opera. And see--he comes.  
  
*Enter* Merlin.  
  
RECITATIVO.  
**Merlin.** Sweet Goddess of inchanting Strains,  
That steal'st, like Drink, into Men's Brains;  
Great Trader in soft, melting, Wane;  
Thou best of Cradles to our Care,  
Lend thy harmonious Aid to free  
From magick Spell this Company.     \[ *solemn Music.*  
And first arise, thou fell--thou hideous Brute--      \[ *waves his
wand.*  
Thou rav'nous Cow!--I do conjure thee to't.  
  
*A Red Cow appears.*      \[ *Curtain drops.*  
Now by emetick Power, Red Cannibal,      \[ *waves his Wand.*  
Cast up thy Pris'ner, *England's Hannibal* .  
Forth from her growling Guts, brave Worthy, come,  
And be thyself--the Little Great TOM THUMB.      \[ *he comes out of her
Mouth, after which she disappears* .  
Now King, now Lords, now Commons, all arise;      \[ *waves his Wand
over each as he speaks.  
* Be loose your Tongues, and open all your Eyes;  
Be chang'd from what ye were--let Faction cease,  
And ev'ry one enjoy his Love in Peace!     \[ *they rise up.  
* **Sir Crit-Operatical.** Wond'rous, astonishing Plot! more sudden than
the Reprieve in the *Beggars Opera* --a Transformation exceeding all
Transformation--even the Comical Transformation, or any in *Ovid's
Metamorphosis* .  
  
RECITATIVO.  
**King.** O *Dollalolla* ! O my Queen!  
Thou only art my Queen!  
**Queen.** O *Arthur* ! O my King!  
Thou only art my King!  
**Huncamunca.** O TOM THUMB!  
**Thumb.** O *Huncamunca* !  
**Grizzle.** Rub well thy Eyes, O *Grizzle* , to see clear!  
Hast thou been in the Moon, or in a Sleep?  
That matters not, but this I know,  
I've slept myself into a better Mood.  
Pardon my late Rebellion, good my Liege--  
*Tom Thumb* , be happy in thy *Hunky* 's Love--  
O sweet *Glumdalca* ! could'st thou be so with me,  
But half a Giant, yet an able Man.  
**Glumdalca.** The Offer's kind, and not to be rejected  
By one in my sad Case--a Stranger here--  
Some hundred thousand Leagues, or more,  
From any of my Giant Country-men.  
  
                       AIR XXXIII.  
      *Dimension, in Lovers, takes all knowing Lasses,  
           From twenty to thirty, or more;  
     But little or great, no matter, he passes  
           With longing Old Maids of two Score.  
     For be he short, or be he tall,  
           One's better, sure, than none at all.*  
  
**Thumb.** Rebellions' dead, tho' we are all alive;  
Cur'd by a Miracle, by giving Life,  
While others heal by taking it away--  
Inchantment happy! Conjuror most blest!  
Among the Faculty of Quacks the best.  
  
DUETTE.  
**Thumb.** Tell, *Hunky* , without feigning,  
Dost thou longer like abstaining?  
**Huncamunca.** View my eyes, and know my meaning.  
**Thumb.** I see the lent of love is past;  
**Huncamunca.** And yet I have not broke my fast;  
**Thumb.** But soon you shall--I'm in the fit.--  
**Huncamunca.** For what?  
**Thumb.** To love.  
**Huncamunca.** Then, prithee humour it.  
**Both.** Ay, prithee let us humor it.  
**Huncamunca.** But dear *Tommy* , prithee say,  
Wilt thou never go astray?  
**Thumb.** I'll be constant as times go;  
I'll sup abroad a night or so.  
**Huncamunca.** But what if I should do the same?  
**Thumb.** You'd only do like modish dame.  
**Huncamunca.** Pshaw! rather let us faithful prove;  
Who shares a lover, does not love.  
**Both.** Who shares a lover does not love.  
**King.** *Bravo! Bravissimo!*  
Thrice three! full nine times happy *Arthur* !  
Shew me the King, who is so bless'd as I?  
My Subjects now no longer by the ears,  
But all shake hands, like friends, with one another.  
  
CHORUS.  
*Let fierce animosities cease,  
Let all marry'd couples agree,  
Let each his own wife kiss in peace,  
And end all their Cavils as we.*  
  
  
FINIS.
