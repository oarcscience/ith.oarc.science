An Arthurian Miscellany at Intangible Textual Heritage

## NEAR AVALON

### by

## WILLIAM MORRIS

  
A ship with shields before the sun,  
Six maidens round the mast,  
A red-gold crown on every one,  
A green gown on the last.  
  
The fluttering green banners there  
Are wrought with ladies' heads most fair,  
And a portraiture of Guenevere  
The middle of each sail doth bear.  
  
A ship with sails before the wind,  
And round the helm six knights,  
Their heaumes are on, whereby, half blind,  
They pass by many sights.  
  
The tatter'd scarlet banners there  
Right soon will leave the spear-heads bare.  
Those six knights sorrowfully bear  
In all their heaumes some yellow hair.
