It was heard<br> At first there was a ghost in Arthur's palace,<br> But soon among the scullions and anon<br> Among the knights a firmer credit held<br> All tongues from uttering what all glances told--<br> Though not for long.  Gawaine, this afternoon,<br> Fearing he might say more to Lancelot<br> Of Merlin's rumor-laden resurrection<br> Than Lancelot would have an ear to cherish,<br> Had sauntered off with his imagination<br> To Merlin's Rock, where now there was no Merlin<br> To meditate upon a whispering town<br> Below him in the silence.--Once he said<br> To Gawaine: "You are young; and that being so,<br> Behold the shining city of our dreams<br> And of our King."--"Long live the King," said Gawaine.--<br> "Long live the King," said Merlin after him;<br> "Better for me that I shall not be King;<br> Wherefore I say again, Long live the King,<br> And add, God save him, also, and all kings--<br> All kings and queens.  I speak in general.<br> Kings have I known that were but weary men<br> With no stout appetite for more than peace<br> That was not made for them."--"Nor were they made<br> For kings," Gawaine said, laughing.--"You are young,<br> Gawaine, and you may one day hold the world<br> Between your fingers, knowing not what it is<br> That you are holding.  Better for you and me,<br> I think, that we shall not be kings."<br> <br>                                      Gawaine,<br> Remembering Merlin's words of long ago,<br> Frowned as he thought, and having frowned again,<br> He smiled and threw an acorn at a lizard:<br> "There's more afoot and in the air to-day<br> Than what is good for Camelot.  Merlin<br> May or may not know all, but he said well<br> To say to me that he would not be King.<br> Nor more would I be King."  Far down he gazed<br> On Camelot, until he made of it<br> A phantom town of many stillnesses,<br> Not reared for men to dwell in, or for kings<br> To reign in, without omens and obscure<br> Familiars to bring terror to their days;<br> For though a knight, and one as hard at arms<br> As any, save the fate-begotten few<br> That all acknowledged or in envy loathed,<br> He felt a foreign sort of creeping up<br> And down him, as of moist things in the dark,--<br> When Dagonet, coming on him unawares,<br> Presuming on his title of Sir Fool,<br> Addressed him and crooned on till he was done:<br> "What look ye for to see, Gawaine, Gawaine?"<br> <br> "Sir Dagonet, you best and wariest<br> Of all dishonest men, I look through Time,<br> For sight of what it is that is to be.<br> I look to see it, though I see it not.<br> I see a town down there that holds a king,<br> And over it I see a few small clouds--<br> Like feathers in the west, as you observe;<br> And I shall see no more this afternoon,<br> Than what there is around us every day,<br> Unless you have a skill that I have not<br> To ferret the invisible for rats."<br> <br> "If you see what's around us every day,<br> You need no other showing to go mad.<br> Remember that and take it home with you;<br> And say tonight, 'I had it of a fool--<br> With no imediate obliquity<br> For this one or for that one, or for me.'"<br> Gawaine, having risen, eyed the fool curiously:<br> "I'll not forget I had it of a knight,<br> Whose only folly is to fool himself;<br> And as for making other men to laugh,<br> And so forget their sins and selves a little,<br> There's no great folly there.  So keep it up,<br> As long as you've a legend or a song,<br> And have whatever sport of us you like<br> Till havoc is the word and we fall howling.<br> For I've a guess there may not be so loud<br> A sound of laughing here in Camelot<br> When Merlin goes again to his gay grave<br> In Brittany.  To mention lesser terrors,<br> Men say his beard is gone."<br> <br>                            "Do men say that?"<br> A twitch of an impatient weariness<br> Played for a moment over the lean face<br> Of Dagonet, who reasoned inwardly:<br> "The friendly zeal of this inquiring knight<br> Will overtake his tact and leave it squealing,<br> One of these days."--Gawaine looked hard at him:<br> "If I be too familiar with a fool,<br> I'm on the way to be another fool,"<br> He mused, and owned a rueful qualm within him:<br> "Yes, Dagonet," he ventured, with a laugh,<br> "Men tell me that his beard has vanished wholly,<br> And that he shines now as the Lord's anointed,<br> And wears the valiance of an ageless youth<br> Crowned with a glory of eternal peace."<br> <br> Dagonet, smiling strangely, shook his head:<br> "I grant your valiance of a kind of youth<br> To Merlin, but your crown of peace I question;<br> For, though I know no more than any churl<br> Who pinches any chambermaid soever<br> In the King's palace, I look not to Merlin<br> For peace, when out of his peculiar tomb<br> He comes again to Camelot.  Time swings<br> A mighty scythe, and some day all your peace<br> Goes down before its edge like so much clover.<br> No, it is not for peace that Merlin comes,<br> Without a trumpet--and without a beard,<br> If what you say men say of him be true--<br> Nor yet for sudden war."<br> <br>                         Gawaine, for a moment,<br> Met then the ambiguous gaze of Dagonet,<br> And, making nothing of it, looked abroad<br> As if at something cheerful on all sides,<br> And back again to the fool's unasking eyes:<br> "Well, Dagonet, if Merlin would have peace,<br> Let Merlin stay away from Brittany,"<br> Said he, with admiration for the man<br> Whom Folly called a fool: "And we have known him;<br> We knew him once when he knew everything."<br> <br> "He knew as much as God would let him know<br> Until he met the lady Vivian.<br> I tell you that, for the world knows all that;<br> Also it knows he told the King one day<br> That he was to be buried, and alive,<br> In Brittany; and that the King should see<br> The face of him no more.  Then Merlin sailed<br> Away to Vivian in Broceliande,<br> Where now she crowns him and herself with flowers<br> And feeds him fruits and wines and many foods<br> Of many savors, and sweet ortolans.<br> Wise books of every lore of every land<br> Are there to fill his days, if he require them,<br> And there are players of all instruments--<br> Flutes, hautboys, drums, and viols; and she sings<br> To Merlin, till he trembles in her arms<br> And there forgets that any town alive<br> Had ever such a name as Camelot.<br> So Vivian holds him with her love, they say,<br> And he, who has no age, has not grown old.<br> I swear to nothing, but that's what they say.<br> That's being buried in Broceliande<br> For too much wisdom and clairvoyancy.<br> But you and all who live, Gawaine, have heard<br> This tale, or many like it, more than once;<br> And you must know that Love, when Love invites<br> Philosophy to play, plays high and wins,<br> Or low and loses.  And you say to me,<br> 'If Merlin would have peace, let Merlin stay<br> Away from Brittany.'  Gawaine, you are young,<br> And Merlin's in his grave."<br> <br>                            "Merlin said once<br> That I was young, and it's a joy for me<br> That I am here to listen while you say it.<br> Young or not young, if that be burial,<br> May I be buried long before I die.<br> I might be worse than young; I might be old."--<br> Dagonet answered, and without a smile:<br> "Somehow I fancy Merlin saying that;<br> <br> A fancy--a mere fancy."  Then he smiled:<br> "And such a doom as his may be for you,<br> Gawaine, should your untiring divination<br> Delve in the veiled eternal mysteries<br> Too far to be a pleasure for the Lord.<br> And when you stake your wisdom for a woman,<br> Compute the woman to be worth a grave,<br> As Merlin did, and say no more about it.<br> But Vivian, she played high.  Oh, very high!<br> Flutes, hautboys, drums, and viols,--and her love.<br> Gawaine, farewell."<br> <br>                    "Farewell, Sir Dagonet,<br> And may the devil take you presently."<br> He followed with a vexed and envious eye,<br> And with an arid laugh, Sir Dagonet's<br> Departure, till his gaunt obscurity<br> Was cloaked and lost amid the glimmering trees.<br> "Poor fool!" he murmured.  "Or am I the fool?<br> With all my fast ascendency in arms,<br> That ominous clown is nearer to the King<br> Than I am--yet; and God knows what he knows,<br> And what his wits infer from what he sees<br> And feels and hears.  I wonder what he knows<br> Of Lancelot, or what I might know now,<br> Could I have sunk myself to sound a fool<br> To springe a friend. . . . No, I like not this day.<br> There's a cloud coming over Camelot<br> Larger than any that is in the sky,--<br> Or Merlin would be still in Brittany,<br> With Vivian and the viols.  It's all too strange."<br> <br> And later, when descending to the city,<br> Through unavailing casements he could hear<br> The roaring of a mighty voice within,<br> Confirming fervidly his own conviction:<br> "It's all too strange, and half the world's half crazy!"--<br> He scowled: "Well, I agree with Lamorak."<br> He frowned, and passed: "And I like not this day."<br> <br>  <center>II</center>  <br> <br> Sir Lamorak, the man of oak and iron,<br> Had with him now, as a care-laden guest,<br> Sir Bedivere, a man whom Arthur loved<br> As he had loved no man save Lancelot.<br> Like one whose late-flown shaft of argument<br> Had glanced and fallen afield innocuously,<br> He turned upon his host a sudden eye<br> That met from Lamorak's an even shaft<br> Of native and unused authority;<br> And each man held the other till at length<br> Each turned away, shutting his heavy jaws<br> Again together, prisoning thus two tongues<br> That might forget and might not be forgiven.<br> Then Bedivere, to find a plain way out,<br> Said, "Lamorak, let us drink to some one here,<br> And end this dryness.  Who shall it be--the King,<br> The Queen, or Lancelot?"--"Merlin," Lamorak growled;<br> And then there were more wrinkles round his eyes<br> Than Bedivere had said were possible.<br> "There's no refusal in me now for that,"<br> The guest replied; "so, 'Merlin' let it be.<br> We've not yet seen him, but if he be here,<br> And even if he should not be here, say 'Merlin.'"<br> They drank to the unseen from two new tankards,<br> And fell straightway to sighing for the past,<br> And what was yet before them.  Silence laid<br> A cogent finger on the lips of each<br> Impatient veteran, whose hard hands lay clenched<br> And restless on his midriff, until words<br> Were stronger than strong Lamorak:<br> <br>                                   "Bedivere,"<br> Began the solid host, "you may as well<br> Say now as at another time hereafter<br> That all your certainties have bruises on 'em,<br> And all your pestilent asseverations<br> Will never make a man a salamander--<br> Who's born, as we are told, so fire won't bite him,--<br> Or a slippery queen a nun who counts and burns<br> Herself to nothing with her beads and candles.<br> There's nature, and what's in us, to be sifted<br> Before we know ourselves, or any man<br> Or woman that God suffers to be born.<br> That's how I speak; and while you strain your mazard,<br> Like Father Jove, big with a new Minerva,<br> We'll say, to pass the time, that I speak well.<br> God's fish!  The King had eyes; and Lancelot<br> Won't ride home to his mother, for she's dead.<br> The story is that Merlin warned the King<br> Of what's come now to pass; and I believe it<br> And Arthur, he being Arthur and a king,<br> Has made a more pernicious mess than one,<br> We're told, for being so great and amorous:<br> It's that unwholesome and inclement cub<br> Young Modred I'd see first in hell before<br> I'd hang too high the Queen or Lancelot;<br> The King, if one may say it, set the pace,<br> And we've two strapping bastards here to prove it.<br> Young Borre, he's well enough; but as for Modred,<br> I squirm as often as I look at him.<br> And there again did Merlin warn the King,<br> The story goes abroad; and I believe it."<br> <br> Sir Bedivere, as one who caught no more<br> Than what he would of Lamorak's outpouring,<br> Inclined his grizzled head and closed his eyes<br> Before he sighed and rubbed his beard and spoke:<br> "For all I know to make it otherwise,<br> The Queen may be a nun some day or other;<br> I'd pray to God for such a thing to be,<br> If prayer for that were not a mockery.<br> We're late now for much praying, Lamorak,<br> When you and I can feel upon our faces<br> A wind that has been blowing over ruins<br> That we had said were castles and high towers--<br> Till Merlin, or the spirit of him, came<br> As the dead come in dreams.  I saw the King<br> This morning, and I saw his face.  Therefore,<br> I tell you, if a state shall have a king,<br> The king must have the state, and be the state;<br> Or then shall we have neither king nor state,<br> But bones and ashes, and high towers all fallen:<br> And we shall have, where late there was a kingdom,<br> A dusty wreck of what was once a glory--<br> A wilderness whereon to crouch and mourn<br> And moralize, or else to build once more<br> For something better or for something worse.<br> Therefore again, I say that Lancelot<br> Has wrought a potent wrong upon the King,<br> And all who serve and recognize the King,<br> And all who follow him and all who love him.<br> Whatever the stormy faults he may have had,<br> To look on him today is to forget them;<br> And if it be too late for sorrow now<br> To save him--for it was a broken man<br> I saw this morning, and a broken king--<br> The God who sets a day for desolation<br> Will not forsake him in Avilion,<br> Or whatsoever shadowy land there be<br> Where peace awaits him on its healing shores."<br> <br> Sir Lamorak, shifting in his oaken chair,<br> Growled like a dog and shook himself like one:<br> "For the stone-chested, helmet-cracking knight<br> That you are known to be from Lyonnesse<br> To northward, Bedivere, you fol-de-rol<br> When days are rancid, and you fiddle-faddle<br> More like a woman than a man with hands<br> Fit for the smiting of a crazy giant<br> With armor an inch thick, as we all know<br> You are, when you're not sermonizing at us.<br> As for the King, I say the King, no doubt,<br> Is angry, sorry, and all sorts of things,<br> For Lancelot, and for his easy Queen,<br> Whom he took knowing she'd thrown sparks already<br> On that same piece of tinder, Lancelot,<br> Who fetched her with him from Leodogran<br> Because the King--God save poor human reason!--<br> Would prove to Merlin, who knew everything<br> Worth knowing in those days, that he was wrong.<br> I'll drink now and be quiet,--but, by God,<br> I'll have to tell you, Brother Bedivere,<br> Once more, to make you listen properly,<br> That crowns and orders, and high palaces,<br> And all the manifold ingredients<br> Of this good solid kingdom, where we sit<br> And spit now at each other with our eyes,<br> Will not go rolling down to hell just yet<br> Because a pretty woman is a fool.<br> And here's Kay coming with his fiddle face<br> As long now as two fiddles.  Sit ye down,<br> Sir Man, and tell us everything you know<br> Of Merlin--or his ghost without a beard.<br> What mostly is it?"<br> <br>                    Sir Kay, the seneschal,<br> Sat wearily while he gazed upon the two:<br> "To you it mostly is, if I err not,<br> That what you hear of Merlin's coming back<br> Is nothing more or less than heavy truth.<br> But ask me nothing of the Queen, I say,<br> For I know nothing.  All I know of her<br> Is what her eyes have told the silences<br> That now attend her; and that her estate<br> Is one for less complacent execration<br> Than quips and innuendoes of the city<br> Would augur for her sin--if there be sin--<br> Or for her name--if now she have a name.<br> And where, I say, is this to lead the King,<br> And after him, the kingdom and ourselves?<br> Here be we, three men of a certain strength<br> And some confessed intelligence, who know<br> That Merlin has come out of Brittany--<br> Out of his grave, as he would say it for us--<br> Because the King has now a desperation<br> More strong upon him than a woman's net<br> Was over Merlin--for now Merlin's here,<br> And two of us who knew him know how well<br> His wisdom, if he have it any longer,<br> Will by this hour have sounded and appraised<br> The grief and wrath and anguish of the King,<br> Requiring mercy and inspiring fear<br> Lest he forego the vigil now most urgent,<br> And leave unwatched a cranny where some worm<br> Or serpent may come in to speculate."<br> <br> "I know your worm, and his worm's name is Modred--<br> Albeit the streets are not yet saying so,"<br> Said Lamorak, as he lowered his wrath and laughed<br> A sort of poisonous apology<br> To Kay: "And in the meantime, I'll be gyved!<br> Here's Bedivere a-wailing for the King,<br> And you, Kay, with a moist eye for the Queen.<br> I think I'll blow a horn for Lancelot;<br> For by my soul a man's in sorry case<br> When Guineveres are out with eyes to scorch him:<br> I'm not so ancient or so frozen certain<br> That I'd ride horses down to skeletons<br> If she were after me.  Has Merlin seen him--<br> This Lancelot, this Queen-fed friend of ours?"<br> <br> Kay answered sighing, with a lonely scowl:<br> "The picture that I conjure leaves him out;<br> The King and Merlin are this hour together,<br> And I can say no more; for I know nothing.<br> But how the King persuaded or beguiled<br> The stricken wizard from across the water<br> Outriddles my poor wits.  It's all too strange."<br> <br> "It's all too strange, and half the world's half crazy!"<br> Roared Lamorak, forgetting once again<br> The devastating carriage of his voice.<br> "Is the King sick?" he said, more quietly;<br> "Is he to let one damned scratch be enough<br> To paralyze the force that heretofore<br> Would operate a way through hell and iron,<br> And iron already slimy with his blood?<br> Is the King blind--with Modred watching him?<br> Does he forget the crown for Lancelot?<br> Does he forget that every woman mewing<br> Shall some day be a handful of small ashes?"<br> <br> "You speak as one for whom the god of Love<br> Has yet a mighty trap in preparation.<br> We know you, Lamorak," said Bedivere:<br> "We know you for a short man, Lamorak,--<br> In deeds, if not in inches or in words;<br> But there are fens and heights and distances<br> That your capricious ranging has not yet<br> Essayed in this weird region of man's love.<br> Forgive me, Lamorak, but your words are words.<br> Your deeds are what they are; and ages hence<br> Will men remember your illustriousness,<br> If there be gratitude in history.<br> For me, I see the shadow of the end,<br> Wherein to serve King Arthur to the end,<br> And, if God have it so, to see the Grail<br> Before I die."<br> <br>               But Lamorak shook his head:<br> "See what you will, or what you may.  For me,<br> I see no other than a stinking mess--<br> With Modred stirring it, and Agravaine<br> Spattering Camelot with as much of it<br> As he can throw.  The Devil got somehow<br> Into God's workshop once upon a time,<br> And out of the red clay that he found there<br> He made a shape like Modred, and another<br> As like as eyes are to this Agravaine.<br> 'I never made 'em,' said the good Lord God,<br> 'But let 'em go, and see what comes of 'em.'<br> And that's what we're to do.  As for the Grail,<br> I've never worried it, and so the Grail<br> Has never worried me."<br> <br>                       Kay sighed.  "I see<br> With Bedivere the coming of the end,"<br> He murmured; "for the King I saw today<br> Was not, nor shall he ever be again,<br> The King we knew.  I say the King is dead;<br> The man is living, but the King is dead.<br> The wheel is broken."<br> <br>                      "Faugh!" said Lamorak;<br> "There are no dead kings yet in Camelot;<br> But there is Modred who is hatching ruin,--<br> And when it hatches I may not be here.<br> There's Gawaine too, and he does not forget<br> My father, who killed his.  King Arthur's house<br> Has more divisions in it than I like<br> In houses; and if Modred's aim be good<br> For backs like mine, I'm not long for the scene."<br>   <center>III</center>  <br> King Arthur, as he paced a lonely floor<br> That rolled a muffled echo, as he fancied,<br> All through the palace and out through the world,<br> Might now have wondered hard, could he have heard<br> Sir Lamorak's apathetic disregard<br> Of what Fate's knocking made so manifest<br> And ominous to others near the King--<br> If any, indeed, were near him at this hour<br> Save Merlin, once the wisest of all men,<br> And weary Dagonet, whom he had made<br> A knight for love of him and his abused<br> Integrity.  He might have wondered hard<br> And wondered much; and after wondering,<br> He might have summoned, with as little heart<br> As he had now for crowns, the fond, lost Merlin,<br> Whose Nemesis had made of him a slave,<br> A man of dalliance, and a sybarite.<br> <br> "Men change in Brittany, Merlin," said the King;<br> And even his grief had strife to freeze again<br> A dreary smile for the transmuted seer<br> Now robed in heavy wealth of purple silk,<br> With frogs and foreign tassels.  On his face,<br> Too smooth now for a wizard or a sage,<br> Lay written, for the King's remembering eyes,<br> A pathos of a lost authority<br> Long faded, and unconscionably gone;<br> And on the King's heart lay a sudden cold:<br> "I might as well have left him in his grave,<br> As he would say it, saying what was true,--<br> As death is true.  This Merlin is not mine,<br> But Vivian's.  My crown is less than hers,<br> And I am less than woman to this man."<br> <br> Then Merlin, as one reading Arthur's words<br> On viewless tablets in the air before him:<br> "Now, Arthur, since you are a child of mine--<br> A foster-child, and that's a kind of child--<br> Be not from hearsay or despair too eager<br> To dash your meat with bitter seasoning,<br> So none that are more famished than yourself<br> Shall have what you refuse.  For you are King,<br> And if you starve yourself, you starve the state;<br> And then by sundry looks and silences<br> Of those you loved, and by the lax regard<br> Of those you knew for fawning enemies,<br> You may learn soon that you are King no more,<br> But a slack, blasted, and sad-fronted man,<br> Made sadder with a crown.  No other friend<br> Than I could say this to you, and say more;<br> And if you bid me say no more, so be it."<br> <br> The King, who sat with folded arms, now bowed<br> His head and felt, unfought and all aflame<br> Like immanent hell-fire, the wretchedness<br> That only those who are to lead may feel--<br> And only they when they are maimed and worn<br> Too sore to covet without shuddering<br> The fixed impending eminence where death<br> Itself were victory, could they but lead<br> Unbitten by the serpents they had fed.<br> Turning, he spoke: "Merlin, you say the truth:<br> There is no man who could say more to me<br> Today, or say so much to me, and live.<br> But you are Merlin still, or part of him;<br> I did you wrong when I thought otherwise,<br> And I am sorry now.  Say what you will.<br> We are alone, and I shall be alone<br> As long as Time shall hide a reason here<br> For me to stay in this infested world<br> Where I have sinned and erred and heeded not<br> Your counsel; and where you yourself--God save us!--<br> Have gone down smiling to the smaller life<br> That you and your incongruous laughter called<br> Your living grave.  God save us all, Merlin,<br> When you, the seer, the founder, and the prophet,<br> May throw the gold of your immortal treasure<br> Back to the God that gave it, and then laugh<br> Because a woman has you in her arms . . .<br> Why do you sting me now with a small hive<br> Of words that are all poison?  I do not ask<br> Much honey; but why poison me for nothing,<br> And with a venom that I know already<br> As I know crowns and wars?  Why tell a king--<br> A poor, foiled, flouted, miserable king--<br> That if he lets rats eat his fingers off<br> He'll have no fingers to fight battles with?<br> I know as much as that, for I am still<br> A king--who thought himself a little less<br> Than God; a king who built him palaces<br> On sand and mud, and hears them crumbling now,<br> And sees them tottering, as he knew they must.<br> You are the man who made me to be King--<br> Therefore, say anything."<br> <br>                          Merlin, stricken deep<br> With pity that was old, being born of old<br> Foreshadowings, made answer to the King:<br> "This coil of Lancelot and Guinevere<br> Is not for any mortal to undo,<br> Or to deny, or to make otherwise;<br> But your most violent years are on their way<br> To days, and to a sounding of loud hours<br> That are to strike for war.  Let not the time<br> Between this hour and then be lost in fears,<br> Or told in obscurations and vain faith<br> In what has been your long security;<br> For should your force be slower then than hate,<br> And your regret be sharper than your sight,<br> And your remorse fall heavier than your sword,--<br> Then say farewell to Camelot, and the crown.<br> But say not you have lost, or failed in aught<br> Your golden horoscope of imperfection<br> Has held in starry words that I have read.<br> I see no farther now than I saw then,<br> For no man shall be given of everything<br> Together in one life; yet I may say<br> The time is imminent when he shall come<br> For whom I founded the Siege Perilous;<br> And he shall be too much a living part<br> Of what he brings, and what he burns away in,<br> To be for long a vexed inhabitant<br> Of this mad realm of stains and lower trials.<br> And here the ways of God again are mixed:<br> For this new knight who is to find the Grail<br> For you, and for the least who pray for you<br> In such lost coombs and hollows of the world<br> As you have never entered, is to be<br> The son of him you trusted--Lancelot,<br> Of all who ever jeopardized a throne<br> Sure the most evil-fated, saving one,<br> Your son, begotten, though you knew not then<br> Your leman was your sister, of Morgause;<br> For it is Modred now, not Lancelot,<br> Whose native hate plans your annihilation--<br> Though he may smile till he be sick, and swear<br> Allegiance to an unforgiven father<br> Until at last he shake an empty tongue<br> Talked out with too much lying--though his lies<br> Will have a truth to steer them.  Trust him not,<br> For unto you the father, he the son<br> Is like enough to be the last of terrors--<br> If in a field of time that looms to you<br> Far larger than it is you fail to plant<br> And harvest the old seeds of what I say,<br> And so be nourished and adept again<br> For what may come to be.  But Lancelot<br> Will have you first; and you need starve no more<br> For the Queen's love, the love that never was.<br> Your Queen is now your Kingdom, and hereafter<br> Let no man take it from you, or you die.<br> Let no man take it from you for a day:<br> For days are long when we are far from what<br> We love, and mischief's other name is distance.<br> Let that be all, for I can say no more;<br> Not even to Blaise the Hermit, were he living,<br> Could I say more than I have given you now<br> To hear; and he alone was my confessor."<br> <br> The King arose and paced the floor again.<br> "I get gray comfort of dark words," he said;<br> "But tell me not that you can say no more:<br> You can, for I can hear you saying it.<br> Yet I'll not ask for more.  I have enough--<br> Until my new knight comes to prove and find<br> The promise and the glory of the Grail,<br> Though I shall see no Grail.  For I have built<br> On sand and mud, and I shall see no Grail."--<br> <br> "Nor I," said Merlin.  "Once I dreamed of it,<br> But I was buried.  I shall see no Grail,<br> Nor would I have it otherwise.  I saw<br> Too much, and that was never good for man.<br> The man who goes alone too far goes mad--<br> In one way or another.  God knew best,<br> And he knows what is coming yet for me.<br> I do not ask.  Like you, I have enough."<br> <br> That night King Arthur's apprehension found<br> In Merlin an obscure and restive guest,<br> Whose only thought was on the hour of dawn,<br> When he should see the last of Camelot<br> And ride again for Brittany; and what words<br> Were said before the King was left alone<br> Were only darker for reiteration.<br> They parted, all provision made secure<br> For Merlin's early convoy to the coast,<br> And Arthur tramped the past.  The loneliness<br> Of kings, around him like the unseen dead,<br> Lay everywhere; and he was loath to move,<br> As if in fear to meet with his cold hand<br> The touch of something colder.  Then a whim,<br> Begotten of intolerable doubt,<br> Seized him and stung him until he was asking<br> If any longer lived among his knights<br> A man to trust as once he trusted all,<br> And Lancelot more than all.  "And it is he<br> Who is to have me first," so Merlin says,--<br> "As if he had me not in hell already.<br> Lancelot! Lancelot!"  He cursed the tears<br> That cooled his misery, and then he asked<br> Himself again if he had one to trust<br> Among his knights, till even Bedivere,<br> Tor, Bors, and Percival, rough Lamorak,<br> Griflet, and Gareth, and gay Gawaine, all<br> Were dubious knaves,--or they were like to be,<br> For cause to make them so; and he had made<br> Himself to be the cause.  "God set me right,<br> Before this folly carry me on farther,"<br> He murmured; and he smiled unhappily,<br> Though fondly, as he thought: "Yes, there is one<br> Whom I may trust with even my soul's last shred;<br> And Dagonet will sing for me tonight<br> An old song, not too merry or too sad."<br> <br> When Dagonet, having entered, stood before<br> The King as one affrighted, the King smiled:<br> "You think because I call for you so late<br> That I am angry, Dagonet?  Why so?<br> Have you been saying what I say to you,<br> And telling men that you brought Merlin here?<br> No?  So I fancied; and if you report<br> No syllable of anything I speak,<br> You will have no regrets, and I no anger.<br> What word of Merlin was abroad today?"<br> <br> "Today have I heard no man save Gawaine,<br> And to him I said only what all men<br> Are saying to their neighbors.  They believe<br> That you have Merlin here, and that his coming<br> Denotes no good.  Gawaine was curious,<br> But ever mindful of your majesty.<br> He pressed me not, and we made light of it."<br> <br> "Gawaine, I fear, makes light of everything,"<br> The King said, looking down.  "Sometimes I wish<br> I had a full Round Table of Gawaines.<br> But that's a freak of midnight,--never mind it.<br> Sing me a song--one of those endless things<br> That Merlin liked of old, when men were younger<br> And there were more stars twinkling in the sky.<br> I see no stars that are alive tonight,<br> And I am not the king of sleep.  So then,<br> Sing me an old song."<br> <br>                      Dagonet's quick eye<br> Caught sorrow in the King's; and he knew more,<br> In a fool's way, than even the King himself<br> Of what was hovering over Camelot.<br> "O King," he said, "I cannot sing tonight.<br> If you command me I shall try to sing,<br> But I shall fail; for there are no songs now<br> In my old throat, or even in these poor strings<br> That I can hardly follow with my fingers.<br> Forgive me--kill me--but I cannot sing."<br> Dagonet fell down then on both his knees<br> And shook there while he clutched the King's cold hand<br> And wept for what he knew.<br> <br>                           "There, Dagonet;<br> I shall not kill my knight, or make him sing.<br> No more; get up, and get you off to bed.<br> There'll be another time for you to sing,<br> So get you to your covers and sleep well."<br> Alone again, the King said, bitterly:<br> "Yes, I have one friend left, and they who know<br> As much of him as of themselves believe<br> That he's a fool.  Poor Dagonet's a fool.<br> And if he be a fool, what else am I<br> Than one fool more to make the world complete?<br> 'The love that never was!' . . . Fool, fool, fool, fool!"<br> <br> The King was long awake.  No covenant<br> With peace was his tonight; and he knew sleep<br> As he knew the cold eyes of Guinevere<br> That yesterday had stabbed him, having first<br> On Lancelot's name struck fire, and left him then<br> As now they left him--with a wounded heart,<br> A wounded pride, and a sickening pang worse yet<br> Of lost possession.  He thought wearily<br> Of watchers by the dead, late wayfarers,<br> Rough-handed mariners on ships at sea,<br> Lone-yawning sentries, wastrels, and all others<br> Who might be saying somewhere to themselves,<br> "The King is now asleep in Camelot;<br> God save the King."--"God save the King, indeed,<br> If there be now a king to save," he said.<br> Then he saw giants rising in the dark,<br> Born horribly of memories and new fears<br> That in the gray-lit irony of dawn<br> Were partly to fade out and be forgotten;<br> And then there might be sleep, and for a time<br> There might again be peace.  His head was hot<br> And throbbing; but the rest of him was cold,<br> As he lay staring hard where nothing stood,<br> And hearing what was not, even while he saw<br> And heard, like dust and thunder far away,<br> The coming confirmation of the words<br> Of him who saw so much and feared so little<br> Of all that was to be.  No spoken doom<br> That ever chilled the last night of a felon<br> Prepared a dragging anguish more profound<br> And absolute than Arthur, in these hours,<br> Made out of darkness and of Merlin's words;<br> No tide that ever crashed on Lyonnesse<br> Drove echoes inland that were lonelier<br> For widowed ears among the fisher-folk,<br> Than for the King were memories tonight<br> Of old illusions that were dead for ever.<br> <br>  <center>IV</center>  <br> The tortured King--seeing Merlin wholly meshed<br> In his defection, even to indifference,<br> And all the while attended and exalted<br> By some unfathomable obscurity<br> Of divination, where the Grail, unseen,<br> Broke yet the darkness where a king saw nothing--<br> Feared now the lady Vivian more than Fate;<br> for now he knew that Modred, Lancelot,<br> The Queen, the King, the Kingdom, and the World,<br> Were less to Merlin, who had made him King,<br> Than one small woman in Broceliande.<br> Whereas the lady Vivian, seeing Merlin<br> Acclaimed and tempted and allured again<br> To service in his old magnificence,<br> Feared now King Arthur more than storms and robbers;<br> For Merlin, though he knew himself immune<br> To no least whispered little wish of hers<br> That might afflict his ear with ecstasy,<br> Had yet sufficient of his old command<br> Of all around him to invest an eye<br> With quiet lightning, and a spoken word<br> With easy thunder, so accomplishing<br> A profit and a pastime for himself--<br> And for the lady Vivian, when her guile<br> Outlived at intervals her graciousness;<br> And this equipment of uncertainty,<br> Which now had gone away with him to Britain<br> With Dagonet, so plagued her memory<br> That soon a phantom brood of goblin doubts<br> Inhabited his absence, which had else<br> Been empty waiting and a few brave fears,<br> And a few more, she knew, that were not brave,<br> Or long to be disowned, or manageable.<br> She thought of him as he had looked at her<br> When first he had acquainted her alarm<br> At sight of the King's letter with its import;<br> And she remembered now his very words:<br> "The King believes today as in his boyhood<br> That I am Fate," he said; and when they parted<br> She had not even asked him not to go;<br> She might as well, she thought, have bid the wind<br> Throw no more clouds across a lonely sky<br> Between her and the moon,--so great he seemed<br> In his oppressed solemnity, and she,<br> In her excess of wrong imagining,<br> So trivial in an hour, and, after all<br> A creature of a smaller consequence<br> Than kings to Merlin, who made kings and kingdoms<br> And had them as a father; and so she feared<br> King Arthur more than robbers while she waited<br> For Merlin's promise to fulfil itself,<br> And for the rest that was to follow after:<br> "He said he would come back, and so he will.<br> He will because he must, and he is Merlin,<br> The master of the world--or so he was;<br> And he is coming back again to me<br> Because he must and I am Vivian.<br> It's all as easy as two added numbers:<br> Some day I'll hear him ringing at the gate,<br> As he rang on that morning in the spring,<br> Ten years ago; and I shall have him then<br> For ever.  He shall never go away<br> Though kings come walking on their hands and knees<br> To take him on their backs."  When Merlin came,<br> She told him that, and laughed; and he said strangely:<br> "Be glad or sorry, but no kings are coming.<br> Not Arthur, surely; for now Arthur knows<br> That I am less than Fate."<br> <br>                           Ten years ago<br> The King had heard, with unbelieving ears<br> At first, what Merlin said would be the last<br> Reiteration of his going down<br> To find a living grave in Brittany:<br> "Buried alive I told you I should be,<br> By love made little and by woman shorn,<br> Like Samson, of my glory; and the time<br> Is now at hand.  I follow in the morning<br> Where I am led.  I see behind me now<br> The last of crossways, and I see before me<br> A straight and final highway to the end<br> Of all my divination.  You are King,<br> And in your kingdom I am what I was.<br> Wherever I have warned you, see as far<br> As I have seen; for I have shown the worst<br> There is to see.  Require no more of me,<br> For I can be no more than what I was."<br> So, on the morrow, the King said farewell;<br> And he was never more to Merlin's eye<br> The King than at that hour; for Merlin knew<br> How much was going out of Arthur's life<br> With him, as he went southward to the sea.<br> <br> Over the waves and into Brittany<br> Went Merlin, to Broceliande.  Gay birds<br> Were singing high to greet him all along<br> A broad and sanded woodland avenue<br> That led him on forever, so he thought,<br> Until at last there was an end of it;<br> And at the end there was a gate of iron,<br> Wrought heavily and invidiously barred.<br> He pulled a cord that rang somewhere a bell<br> Of many echoes, and sat down to rest,<br> Outside the keeper's house, upon a bench<br> Of carven stone that might for centuries<br> Have waited there in silence to receive him.<br> The birds were singing still; leaves flashed and swung<br> Before him in the sunlight; a soft breeze<br> Made intermittent whisperings around him<br> Of love and fate and danger, and faint waves<br> Of many sweetly-stinging fragile odors<br> Broke lightly as they touched him; cherry-boughs<br> Above him snowed white petals down upon him,<br> And under their slow falling Merlin smiled<br> Contentedly, as one who contemplates<br> No longer fear, confusion, or regret,<br> May smile at ruin or at revelation.<br> <br> A stately fellow with a forest air<br> Now hailed him from within, with searching words<br> And curious looks, till Merlin's glowing eye<br> Transfixed him and he flinched: "My compliments<br> And homage to the lady Vivian.<br> Say Merlin from King Arthur's Court is here,<br> A pilgrim and a stranger in appearance,<br> Though in effect her friend and humble servant.<br> Convey to her my speech as I have said it,<br> Without abbreviation or delay,<br> And so deserve my gratitude forever."<br> "But Merlin?" the man stammered; "Merlin? Merlin?"--<br> "One Merlin is enough.  I know no other.<br> Now go you to the lady Vivian<br> And bring to me her word, for I am weary."<br> Still smiling at the cherry-blossoms falling<br> Down on him and around him in the sunlight,<br> He waited, never moving, never glancing<br> This way or that, until his messenger<br> Came jingling into vision, weighed with keys,<br> And inly shaken with much wondering<br> At this great wizard's coming unannounced<br> And unattended.  When the way was open<br> The stately messenger, now bowing low<br> In reverence and awe, bade Merlin enter;<br> And Merlin, having entered, heard the gate<br> Clang back behind him; and he swore no gate<br> Like that had ever clanged in Camelot,<br> Or any other place if not in hell.<br> "I may be dead; and this good fellow here,<br> With all his keys," he thought, "may be the Devil,--<br> Though I were loath to say so, for the keys<br> Would make him rather more akin to Peter;<br> And that's fair reasoning for this fair weather."<br> <br> "The lady Vivian says you are most welcome,"<br> Said now the stately-favored servitor,<br> "And are to follow me.  She said, 'Say Merlin--<br> A pilgrim and a stranger in appearance,<br> Though in effect my friend and humble servant--<br> Is welcome for himself, and for the sound<br> Of his great name that echoes everywhere.'"--<br> "I like you and I like your memory,"<br> Said Merlin, curiously, "but not your gate.<br> Why forge for this elysian wilderness<br> A thing so vicious with unholy noise?"--<br> "There's a way out of every wilderness<br> For those who dare or care enough to find it,"<br> The guide said: and they moved along together,<br> Down shaded ways, through open ways with hedgerows,<br> And into shade again more deep than ever,<br> But edged anon with rays of broken sunshine<br> In which a fountain, raining crystal music,<br> Made faery magic of it through green leafage,<br> Till Merlin's eyes were dim with preparation<br> For sight now of the lady Vivian.<br> He saw at first a bit of living green<br> That might have been a part of all the green<br> Around the tinkling fountain where she gazed<br> Upon the circling pool as if her thoughts<br> Were not so much on Merlin--whose advance<br> Betrayed through his enormity of hair<br> The cheeks and eyes of youth--as on the fishes.<br> But soon she turned and found him, now alone,<br> And held him while her beauty and her grace<br> Made passing trash of empires, and his eyes<br> Told hers of what a splendid emptiness<br> Her tedious world had been without him in it<br> Whose love and service were to be her school,<br> Her triumph, and her history: "This is Merlin,"<br> She thought; "and I shall dream of him no more.<br> And he has come, he thinks, to frighten me<br> With beards and robes and his immortal fame;<br> Or is it I who think so?  I know not.<br> I'm frightened, sure enough, but if I show it,<br> I'll be no more the Vivian for whose love<br> He tossed away his glory, or the Vivian<br> Who saw no man alive to make her love him<br> Till she saw Merlin once in Camelot,<br> And seeing him, saw no other.  In an age<br> That has no plan for me that I can read<br> Without him, shall he tell me what I am,<br> And why I am, I wonder?"  While she thought,<br> And feared the man whom her perverse negation<br> Must overcome somehow to soothe her fancy,<br> She smiled and welcomed him; and so they stood,<br> Each finding in the other's eyes a gleam<br> Of what eternity had hidden there.<br> <br> "Are you always all in green, as you are now?"<br> Said Merlin, more employed with her complexion,<br> Where blood and olive made wild harmony<br> With eyes and wayward hair that were too dark<br> For peace if they were not subordinated;<br> "If so you are, then so you make yourself<br> A danger in a world of many dangers.<br> If I were young, God knows if I were safe<br> Concerning you in green, like a slim cedar,<br> As you are now, to say my life was mine:<br> Were you to say to me that I should end it,<br> Longevity for me were jeopardized.<br> Have you your green on always and all over?"<br> <br> "Come here, and I will tell you about that,"<br> Said Vivian, leading Merlin with a laugh<br> To an arbored seat where they made opposites:<br> "If you are Merlin--and I know you are,<br> For I remember you in Camelot,--<br> You know that I am Vivian, as I am;<br> And if I go in green, why, let me go so,<br> And say at once why you have come to me<br> Cloaked over like a monk, and with a beard<br> As long as Jeremiah's.  I don't like it.<br> I'll never like a man with hair like that<br> While I can feed a carp with little frogs.<br> I'm rather sure to hate you if you keep it,<br> And when I hate a man I poison him."<br> <br> "You've never fed a carp with little frogs,"<br> Said Merlin; "I can see it in your eyes."--<br> "I might then, if I haven't," said the lady;<br> "For I'm a savage, and I love no man<br> As I have seen him yet.  I'm here alone,<br> With some three hundred others, all of whom<br> Are ready, I dare say, to die for me;<br> I'm cruel and I'm cold, and I like snakes;<br> And some have said my mother was a fairy,<br> Though I believe it not."<br> <br>                          "Why not believe it?"<br> Said Merlin; "I believe it.  I believe<br> Also that you divine, as I had wished,<br> In my surviving ornament of office<br> A needless imposition on your wits,<br> If not yet on the scope of your regard.<br> Even so, you cannot say how old I am,<br> Or yet how young.  I'm willing cheerfully<br> To fight, left-handed, Hell's three headed hound<br> If you but whistle him up from where he lives;<br> I'm cheerful and I'm fierce, and I've made kings;<br> And some have said my father was the Devil,<br> Though I believe it not.  Whatever I am,<br> I have not lived in Time until to-day."<br> A moment's worth of wisdom there escaped him,<br> But Vivian seized it, and it was not lost.<br> <br> Embroidering doom with many levities,<br> Till now the fountain's crystal silver, fading,<br> Became a splash and a mere chilliness,<br> They mocked their fate with easy pleasantries<br> That were too false and small to be forgotten,<br> And with ingenious insincerities<br> That had no repetition or revival.<br> At last the lady Vivian arose,<br> And with a crying of how late it was<br> Took Merlin's hand and led him like a child<br> Along a dusky way between tall cones<br> Of tight green cedars: "Am I like one of these?<br> You said I was, though I deny it wholly."--<br> "Very," said Merlin, to his bearded lips<br> Uplifting her small fingers.--"O, that hair?"<br> She moaned, as if in sorrow: "Must it be?<br> Must every prophet and important wizard<br> Be clouded so that nothing but his nose<br> And eyes, and intimations of his ears,<br> Are there to make us know him when we see him?<br> Praise heaven I'm not a prophet!  Are you glad?"--<br> <br> He did not say that he was glad or sorry;<br> For suddenly came flashing into vision<br> A thing that was a manor and a castle,<br> With walls and roofs that had a flaming sky<br> Behind them, like a sky that he remembered,<br> And one that had from his rock-sheltered haunt<br> Above the roofs of his forsaken city<br> Made flame as if all Camelot were on fire.<br> The glow brought with it a brief memory<br> Of Arthur as he left him, and the pain<br> That fought in Arthur's eyes for losing him,<br> And must have overflowed when he had vanished.<br> But now the eyes that looked hard into his<br> Were Vivian's, not the King's; and he could see,<br> Or so he thought, a shade of sorrow in them.<br> She took his two hands: "You are sad," she said.--<br> He smiled: "Your western lights bring memories<br> Of Camelot.  We all have memories--<br> Prophets, and women who are like slim cedars;<br> But you are wrong to say that I am sad."--<br> "Would you go back to Camelot?" she asked,<br> Her fingers tightening.  Merlin shook his head.<br> "Then listen while I tell you that I'm glad,"<br> She purred, as if assured that he would listen:<br> "At your first warning, much too long ago,<br> Of this quaint pilgrimage of yours to see<br> 'The fairest and most orgulous of ladies'--<br> No language for a prophet, I am sure--<br> Said I, 'When this great Merlin comes to me,<br> My task and avocation for some time<br> Will be to make him willing, if I can,<br> To teach and feed me with an ounce of wisdom.'<br> For I have eaten to an empty shell,<br> After a weary feast of observation<br> Among the glories of a tinsel world<br> That had for me no glory till you came,<br> A life that is no life.  Would you go back<br> To Camelot?"--Merlin shook his head again,<br> And the two smiled together in the sunset.<br> <br> They moved along in silence to the door,<br> Where Merlin said: "Of your three hundred here<br> There is but one I know, and him I favor;<br> I mean the stately one who shakes the keys<br> Of that most evil sounding gate of yours,<br> Which has a clang as if it shut forever."--<br> "If there be need, I'll shut the gate myself,"<br> She said.  "And you like Blaise?  Then you shall have him.<br> He was not born to serve, but serve he must,<br> It seems, and be enamoured of my shadow.<br> He cherishes the taint of some high folly<br> That haunts him with a name he cannot know,<br> And I could fear his wits are paying for it.<br> Forgive his tongue, and humor it a little."--<br> "I knew another one whose name was Blaise,"<br> He said; and she said lightly, "Well, what of it?"--<br> "And he was nigh the learnedest of hermits;<br> His home was far away from everywhere,<br> And he was all alone there when he died."--<br> "Now be a pleasant Merlin," Vivian said,<br> Patting his arm, "and have no more of that;<br> for I'll not hear of dead men far away,<br> Or dead men anywhere this afternoon.<br> There'll be a trifle in the way of supper<br> This evening, but the dead shall not have any.<br> Blaise and this man will tell you all there is<br> For you to know.  Then you'll know everything."<br> She laughed, and vanished like a humming-bird.<br>   <center>V</center>  <br> <br> The sun went down, and the dark after it<br> Starred Merlin's new abode with many a sconced<br> And many a moving candle, in whose light<br> The prisoned wizard, mirrored in amazement,<br> Saw fronting him a stranger, falcon-eyed,<br> Firm-featured, of a negligible age,<br> And fair enough to look upon, he fancied,<br> Though not a warrior born, nor more a courtier.<br> A native humor resting in his long<br> And solemn jaws now stirred, and Merlin smiled<br> To see himself in purple, touched with gold,<br> And fledged with snowy lace.--The careful Blaise,<br> Having drawn some time before from Merlin's wallet<br> The sable raiment of a royal scholar,<br> Had eyed it with a long mistrust and said:<br> "The lady Vivian would be vexed, I fear,<br> To meet you vested in these learned weeds<br> Of gravity and death; for she abhors<br> Mortality in all its hues and emblems--<br> Black wear, long argument, and all the cold<br> And solemn things that appertain to graves."--<br> And Merlin, listening, to himself had said,<br> "This fellow has a freedom, yet I like him;"<br> And then aloud: "I trust you.  Deck me out,<br> However, with a temperate regard<br> For what your candid eye may find in me<br> Of inward coloring.  Let them reap my beard,<br> Moreover, with a sort of reverence,<br> For I shall never look on it again.<br> And though your lady frown her face away<br> To think of me in black, for God's indulgence,<br> Array me not in scarlet or in yellow."--<br> And so it came to pass that Merlin sat<br> At ease in purple, even though his chin<br> Reproached him as he pinched it, and seemed yet<br> A little fearful of its nakedness.<br> He might have sat and scanned himself for ever<br> Had not the careful Blaise, regarding him,<br> Remarked again that in his proper judgment,<br> And on the valid word of his attendants,<br> No more was to be done.  "Then do no more,"<br> Said Merlin, with a last look at his chin;<br> "Never do more when there's no more to do,<br> And you may shun thereby the bitter taste<br> Of many disillusions and regrets.<br> God's pity on us that our words have wings<br> And leave our deeds to crawl so far below them;<br> For we have all two heights, we men who dream,<br> Whether we lead or follow, rule or serve."--<br> "God's pity on us anyhow," Blaise answered,<br> "Or most of us.  Meanwhile, I have to say,<br> As long as you are here, and I'm alive,<br> Your summons will assure the loyalty<br> Of all my diligence and expedition.<br> The gong that you hear singing in the distance<br> Was rung for your attention and your presence."--<br> "I wonder at this fellow, yet I like him,"<br> Said Merlin; and he rose to follow him.<br> <br> The lady Vivian in a fragile sheath<br> Of crimson, dimmed and veiled ineffably<br> By the flame-shaken gloom wherein she sat,<br> And twinkled if she moved, heard Merlin coming,<br> And smiled as if to make herself believe<br> Her joy was all a triumph; yet her blood<br> Confessed a tingling of more wonderment<br> Than all her five and twenty worldly years<br> Of waiting for this triumph could remember;<br> And when she knew and felt the slower tread<br> Of his unseen advance among the shadows<br> To the small haven of uncertain light<br> That held her in it as a torch-lit shoal<br> Might hold a smooth red fish, her listening skin<br> Responded with a creeping underneath it,<br> And a crinkling that was incident alike<br> To darkness, love, and mice.  When he was there,<br> She looked up at him in a whirl of mirth<br> And wonder, as in childhood she had gazed<br> Wide-eyed on royal mountebanks who made<br> So brief a shift of the impossible<br> That kings and queens would laugh and shake themselves;<br> Then rising slowly on her little feet,<br> Like a slim creature lifted, she thrust out<br> Her two small hands as if to push him back--<br> Whereon he seized them.  "Go away," she said;<br> "I never saw you in my life before."--<br> "You say the truth," he answered; "when I met<br> Myself an hour ago, my words were yours.<br> God made the man you see for you to like,<br> If possible.  If otherwise, turn down<br> These two prodigious and remorseless thumbs<br> And leave your lions to annihilate him."--<br> <br> "I have no other lion than yourself,"<br> She said; "and since you cannot eat yourself,<br> Pray do a lonely woman, who is, you say,<br> More like a tree than any other thing<br> In your discrimination, the large honor<br> Of sharing with her a small kind of supper."--<br> "Yes, you are like a tree,--or like a flower;<br> More like a flower to-night."  He bowed his head<br> And kissed the ten small fingers he was holding,<br> As calmly as if each had been a son;<br> Although his heart was leaping and his eyes<br> Had sight for nothing save a swimming crimson<br> Between two glimmering arms.  "More like a flower<br> To-night," he said, as now he scanned again<br> The immemorial meaning of her face<br> And drew it nearer to his eyes.  It seemed<br> A flower of wonder with a crimson stem<br> Came leaning slowly and regretfully<br> To meet his will--a flower of change and peril<br> That had a clinging blossom of warm olive<br> Half stifled with a tyranny of black,<br> And held the wayward fragrance of a rose<br> Made woman by delirious alchemy.<br> She raised her face and yoked his willing neck<br> With half her weight; and with hot lips that left<br> The world with only one philosophy<br> For Merlin or for Anaxagoras,<br> Called his to meet them and in one long hush<br> Of capture to surrender and make hers<br> The last of anything that might remain<br> Of what was now their beardless wizardry.<br> Then slowly she began to push herself<br> Away, and slowly Merlin let her go<br> As far from him as his outreaching hands<br> Could hold her fingers while his eyes had all<br> The beauty of the woodland and the world<br> Before him in the firelight, like a nymph<br> Of cities, or a queen a little weary<br> Of inland stillness and immortal trees.<br> <br> "Are you to let me go again sometime,"<br> She said,--"before I starve to death, I wonder?<br> If not, I'll have to bite the lion's paws,<br> And make him roar.  He cannot shake his mane,<br> For now the lion has no mane to shake;<br> The lion hardly knows himself without it,<br> And thinks he has no face, but there's a lady<br> Who says he had no face until he lost it.<br> So there we are.  And there's a flute somewhere,<br> Playing a strange old tune.  You know the words:<br> 'The Lion and the Lady are both hungry.'"<br> <br> Fatigue and hunger--tempered leisurely<br> With food that some devout magician's oven<br> Might after many failures have delivered,<br> And wine that had for decades in the dark<br> Of Merlin's grave been slowly quickening,<br> And with half-heard, dream-weaving interludes<br> Of distant flutes and viols, made more distant<br> By far, nostalgic hautboys blown from nowhere,--<br> Were tempered not so leisurely, may be,<br> With Vivian's inextinguishable eyes<br> Between two shining silver candlesticks<br> That lifted each a trembling flame to make<br> The rest of her a dusky loveliness<br> Against a bank of shadow.  Merlin made,<br> As well as he was able while he ate,<br> A fair division of the fealty due<br> To food and beauty, albeit more times than one<br> Was he at odds with his urbanity<br> In honoring too long the grosser viand.<br> "The best invention in Broceliande<br> Has not been over-taxed in vain, I see,"<br> She told him, with her chin propped on her fingers<br> And her eyes flashing blindness into his:<br> "I put myself out cruelly to please you,<br> And you, for that, forget almost at once<br> The name and image of me altogether.<br> You needn't, for when all is analyzed,<br> It's only a bird-pie that you are eating."<br> <br> "I know not what you call it," Merlin said;<br> "Nor more do I forget your name and image,<br> Though I do eat; and if I did not eat,<br> Your sending out of ships and caravans<br> To get whatever 'tis that's in this thing<br> Would be a sorrow for you all your days;<br> And my great love, which you have seen by now,<br> Might look to you a lie; and like as not<br> You'd actuate some sinewed mercenary<br> To carry me away to God knows where<br> And seal me in a fearsome hole to starve,<br> Because I made of this insidious picking<br> An idle circumstance.  My dear fair lady--<br> And there is not another under heaven<br> So fair as you are as I see you now--<br> I cannot look at you too much and eat;<br> And I must eat, or be untimely ashes,<br> Whereon the light of your celestial gaze<br> Would fall, I fear me, for no longer time<br> Than on the solemn dust of Jeremiah--<br> Whose beard you likened once, in heathen jest,<br> To mine that now is no man's."<br> <br>                               "Are you sorry?"<br> Said Vivian, filling Merlin's empty goblet;<br> "If you are sorry for the loss of it,<br> Drink more of this and you may tell me lies<br> Enough to make me sure that you are glad;<br> But if your love is what you say it is,<br> Be never sorry that my love took off<br> That horrid hair to make your face at last<br> A human fact.  Since I have had your name<br> To dream of and say over to myself,<br> The visitations of that awful beard<br> Have been a terror for my nights and days--<br> For twenty years.  I've seen it like an ocean,<br> Blown seven ways at once and wrecking ships,<br> With men and women screaming for their lives;<br> I've seen it woven into shining ladders<br> That ran up out of sight and so to heaven,<br> All covered with white ghosts with hanging robes<br> Like folded wings,--and there were millions of them,<br> Climbing, climbing, climbing, all the time;<br> And all the time that I was watching them<br> I thought how far above me Merlin was,<br> And wondered always what his face was like.<br> But even then, as a child, I knew the day<br> Would come some time when I should see his face<br> And hear his voice, and have him in my house<br> Till he should care no more to stay in it,<br> And go away to found another kingdom."--<br> "Not that," he said; and, sighing, drank more wine;<br> "One kingdom for one Merlin is enough."--<br> "One Merlin for one Vivian is enough,"<br> She said.  "If you care much, remember that;<br> But the Lord knows how many Vivians<br> One Merlin's entertaining eye might favor,<br> Indifferently well and all at once,<br> If they were all at hand.  Praise heaven they're not."<br> <br> "If they were in the world--praise heaven they're not--<br> And if one Merlin's entertaining eye<br> Saw two of them, there might be left him then<br> The sight of no eye to see anything--<br> Not even the Vivian who is everything,<br> She being Beauty, Beauty being She,<br> She being Vivian, and so on for ever."--<br> "I'm glad you don't see two of me," she said;<br> "For there's a whole world yet for you to eat<br> And drink and say to me before I know<br> The sort of creature that you see in me.<br> I'm withering for a little more attention,<br> But, being woman, I can wait.  These cups<br> That you see coming are for the last there is<br> Of what my father gave to kings alone,<br> And far from always.  You are more than kings<br> To me; therefore I give it all to you,<br> Imploring you to spare no more of it<br> Than a small cockle-shell would hold for me<br> To pledge your love and mine in.  Take the rest,<br> That I may see tonight the end of it.<br> I'll have no living remnant of the dead<br> Annoying me until it fades and sours<br> Of too long cherishing; for Time enjoys<br> The look that's on our faces when we scowl<br> On unexpected ruins, and thrift itself<br> May be a sort of slow unwholesome fire<br> That eats away to dust the life that feeds it.<br> You smile, I see, but I said what I said.<br> One hardly has to live a thousand years<br> To contemplate a lost economy;<br> So let us drink it while it's yet alive<br> And you and I are not untimely ashes.<br> My last words are your own, and I don't like 'em."--<br> A sudden laughter scattered from her eyes<br> A threatening wisdom.  He smiled and let her laugh,<br> Then looked into the dark where there was nothing:<br> "There's more in this than I have seen," he thought,<br> "Though I shall see it."--"Drink," she said again;<br> "There's only this much in the world of it,<br> And I am near to giving all to you<br> Because you are so great and I so little."<br> <br> With a long-kindling gaze that caught from hers<br> A laughing flame, and with a hand that shook<br> Like Arthur's kingdom, Merlin slowly raised<br> A golden cup that for a golden moment<br> Was twinned in air with hers; and Vivian,<br> Who smiled at him across their gleaming rims,<br> From eyes that made a fuel of the night<br> Surrounding her, shot glory over gold<br> At Merlin, while their cups touched and his trembled.<br> He drank, not knowing what, nor caring much<br> For kings who might have cared less for themselves,<br> He thought, had all the darkness and wild light<br> That fell together to make Vivian<br> Been there before them then to flower anew<br> Through sheathing crimson into candle-light<br> With each new leer of their loose, liquorish eyes.<br> Again he drank, and he cursed every king<br> Who might have touched her even in her cradle;<br> For what were kings to such as he, who made them<br> And saw them totter--for the world to see,<br> And heed, if the world would?  He drank again,<br> And yet again--to make himself assured<br> No manner of king should have the last of it--<br> The cup that Vivian filled unfailingly<br> Until she poured for nothing.  "At the end<br> Of this incomparable flowing gold,"<br> She prattled on to Merlin, who observed<br> Her solemnly, "I fear there may be specks."--<br> He sighed aloud, whereat she laughed at him<br> And pushed the golden cup a little nearer.<br> He scanned it with a sad anxiety,<br> And then her face likewise, and shook his head<br> As if at her concern for such a matter:<br> "Specks?  What are specks?  Are you afraid of them?"<br> He murmured slowly, with a drowsy tongue;<br> "There are specks everywhere.  I fear them not.<br> If I were king in Camelot, I might<br> Fear more than specks.  But now I fear them not.<br> You are too strange a lady to fear specks."<br> <br> He stared a long time at the cup of gold<br> Before him but he drank no more.  There came<br> Between him and the world a crumbling sky<br> Of black and crimson, with a crimson cloud<br> That held a far off town of many towers.<br> All swayed and shaken, till at last they fell,<br> And there was nothing but a crimson cloud<br> That crumbled into nothing, like the sky<br> That vanished with it, carrying away<br> The world, the woman, and all memory of them,<br> Until a slow light of another sky<br> Made gray an open casement, showing him<br> Faint shapes of an exotic furniture<br> That glimmered with a dim magnificence,<br> And letting in the sound of many birds<br> That were, as he lay there remembering,<br> The only occupation of his ears<br> Until it seemed they shared a fainter sound,<br> As if a sleeping child with a black head<br> Beside him drew the breath of innocence.<br> <br> One shining afternoon around the fountain,<br> As on the shining day of his arrival,<br> The sunlight was alive with flying silver<br> That had for Merlin a more dazzling flash<br> Than jewels rained in dreams, and a richer sound<br> Than harps, and all the morning stars together,--<br> When jewels and harps and stars and everything<br> That flashed and sang and was not Vivian,<br> Seemed less than echoes of her least of words--<br> For she was coming.  Suddenly, somewhere<br> Behind him, she was coming; that was all<br> He knew until she came and took his hand<br> And held it while she talked about the fishes.<br> When she looked up he thought a softer light<br> Was in her eyes than once he had found there;<br> And had there been left yet for dusky women<br> A beauty that was heretofore not hers,<br> He told himself he must have seen it then<br> Before him in the face at which he smiled<br> And trembled.  "Many men have called me wise,"<br> He said, "but you are wiser than all wisdom<br> If you know what you are."--"I don't," she said;<br> "I know that you and I are here together;<br> I know that I have known for twenty years<br> That life would be almost a constant yawning<br> Until you came; and now that you are here,<br> I know that you are not to go away<br> Until you tell me that I'm hideous;<br> I know that I like fishes, ferns, and snakes,--<br> Maybe because I liked them when the world<br> Was young and you and I were salamanders;<br> I know, too, a cool place not far from here,<br> Where there are ferns that are like marching men<br> Who never march away.  Come now and see them,<br> And do as they do--never march away.<br> When they are gone, some others, crisp and green,<br> Will have their place, but never march away."--<br> He smoothed her silky fingers, one by one:<br> "Some other Merlin, also, do you think,<br> Will have his place--and never march away?"--<br> Then Vivian laid a finger on his lips<br> And shook her head at him before she laughed:<br> "There is no other Merlin than yourself,<br> And you are never going to be old."<br> <br> Oblivious of a world that made of him<br> A jest, a legend, and a long regret,<br> And with a more commanding wizardry<br> Than his to rule a kingdom where the king<br> Was Love and the queen Vivian, Merlin found<br> His queen without the blemish of a word<br> That was more rough than honey from her lips,<br> Or the first adumbration of a frown<br> To cloud the night-wild fire that in her eyes<br> Had yet a smoky friendliness of home,<br> And a foreknowing care for mighty trifles.<br> "There are miles and miles for you to wander in,"<br> She told him once: "Your prison yard is large,<br> And I would rather take my two ears off<br> And feed them to the fishes in the fountain<br> Than buzz like an incorrigible bee<br> For always around yours, and have you hate<br> The sound of me; for some day then, for certain,<br> Your philosophic rage would see in me<br> A bee in earnest, and your hand would smite<br> My life away.  And what would you do then?<br> I know: for years and years you'd sit alone<br> Upon my grave, and be the grieving image<br> Of lean remorse, and suffer miserably;<br> And often, all day long, you'd only shake<br> Your celebrated head and all it holds,<br> Or beat it with your fist the while you groaned<br> Aloud and went on saying to yourself:<br> 'Never should I have killed her, or believed<br> She was a bee that buzzed herself to death,<br> First having made me crazy, had there been<br> Judicious distance and wise absences<br> To keep the two of us inquisitive.'"--<br> "I fear you bow your unoffending head<br> Before a load that should be mine," said he;<br> "If so, you led me on by listening.<br> You should have shrieked and jumped, and then fled yelling;<br> That's the best way when a man talks too long.<br> God's pity on me if I love your feet<br> More now than I could ever love the face<br> Of any one of all those Vivians<br> You summoned out of nothing on the night<br> When I saw towers.  I'll wander and amend."--<br> At that she flung the noose of her soft arms<br> Around his neck and kissed him instantly:<br> "You are the wisest man that ever was,<br> And I've a prayer to make: May all you say<br> To Vivian be a part of what you knew<br> Before the curse of her unquiet head<br> Was on your shoulder, as you have it now,<br> To punish you for knowing beyond knowledge.<br> You are the only one who sees enough<br> To make me see how far away I am<br> From all that I have seen and have not been;<br> You are the only thing there is alive<br> Between me as I am and as I was<br> When Merlin was a dream.  You are to listen<br> When I say now to you that I'm alone.<br> Like you, I saw too much; and unlike you<br> I made no kingdom out of what I saw--<br> Or none save this one here that you must rule,<br> Believing you are ruled.  I see too far<br> To rule myself.  Time's way with you and me<br> Is our way, in that we are out of Time<br> And out of tune with Time.  We have this place,<br> And you must hold us in it or we die.<br> Look at me now and say if what I say<br> Be folly or not; for my unquiet head<br> Is no conceit of mine.  I had it first<br> When I was born; and I shall have it with me<br> Till my unquiet soul is on its way<br> To be, I hope, where souls are quieter.<br> So let the first and last activity<br> Of what you say so often is your love<br> Be always to remember that our lyres<br> Are not strung for Today.  On you it falls<br> To keep them in accord here with each other,<br> For you have wisdom, I have only sight<br> For distant things--and you.  And you are Merlin.<br> Poor wizard!  Vivian is your punishment<br> For making kings of men who are not kings;<br> And you are mine, by the same reasoning,<br> For living out of Time and out of tune<br> With anything but you.  No other man<br> Could make me say so much of what I know<br> As I say now to you.  And you are Merlin!"<br> <br> She looked up at him till his way was lost<br> Again in the familiar wilderness<br> Of night that love made for him in her eyes,<br> And there he wandered as he said he would;<br> He wandered also in his prison-yard,<br> And, when he found her coming after him,<br> Beguiled her with her own admonishing<br> And frowned upon her with her own admonishing<br> And frowned upon her with a fierce reproof<br> That many a time in the old world outside<br> Had set the mark of silence on strong men--<br> Whereat she laughed, not always wholly sure,<br> Nor always wholly glad, that he who played<br> So lightly was the wizard of her dreams:<br> "No matter--if only Merlin keep the world<br> Away," she thought.  "Our lyres have many strings,<br> But he must know them all, for he is Merlin."<br> <br> And so for years, till ten of them were gone,--<br> Ten years, ten seasons, or ten flying ages--<br> Fate made Broceliande a paradise,<br> By none invaded, until Dagonet,<br> Like a discordant, awkward bird of doom,<br> Flew in with Arthur's message.  For the King,<br> In sorrow cleaving to simplicity,<br> And having in his love a quick remembrance<br> Of Merlin's old affection for the fellow,<br> Had for this vain, reluctant enterprise<br> Appointed him--the knight who made men laugh,<br> And was a fool because he played the fool.<br> <br> "The King believes today, as in his boyhood,<br> That I am Fate; and I can do no more<br> Than show again what in his heart he knows,"<br> Said Merlin to himself and Vivian:<br> "This time I go because I made him King,<br> Thereby to be a mirror for the world;<br> This time I go, but never after this,<br> For I can be no more than what I was,<br> And I can do no more than I have done."<br> He took her slowly in his arms and felt<br> Her body throbbing like a bird against him:<br> "This time I go; I go because I must."<br> <br> And in the morning, when he rode away<br> With Dagonet and Blaise through the same gate<br> That once had clanged as if to shut for ever,<br> She had not even asked him not to go;<br> For it was then that in his lonely gaze<br> Of helpless love and sad authority<br> She found the gleam of his imprisoned power<br> That Fate withheld; and, pitying herself,<br> She pitied the fond Merlin she had changed,<br> And saw the Merlin who had changed the world.<br> <br>  <center>VI</center>  <br> "No kings are coming on their hands and knees,<br> Nor yet on horses or in chariots,<br> To carry me away from you again,"<br> Said Merlin, winding around Vivian's ear<br> A shred of her black hair.  "King Arthur knows<br> That I have done with kings, and that I speak<br> No more their crafty language.  Once I knew it,<br> But now the only language I have left<br> Is one that I must never let you hear<br> Too long, or know too well.  When towering deeds<br> Once done shall only out of dust and words<br> Be done again, the doer may then be wary<br> Lest in the complement of his new fabric<br> There be more words than dust."<br> <br>                                "Why tell me so?"<br> Said Vivian; and a singular thin laugh<br> Came after her thin question.  "Do you think<br> That I'm so far away from history<br> That I require, even of the wisest man<br> Who ever said the wrong thing to a woman,<br> So large a light on what I know already--<br> When all I seek is here before me now<br> In your new eyes that you have brought for me<br> From Camelot?  The eyes you took away<br> Were sad and old; and I could see in them<br> A Merlin who remembered all the kings<br> He ever saw, and wished himself, almost,<br> Away from Vivian, to make other kings,<br> And shake the world again in the old manner.<br> I saw myself no bigger than a beetle<br> For several days, and wondered if your love<br> Were large enough to make me any larger<br> When you came back.  Am I a beetle still?"<br> She stood up on her toes and held her cheek<br> For some time against his, and let him go.<br> <br> "I fear the time has come for me to wander<br> A little in my prison-yard," he said.--<br> "No, tell me everything that you have seen<br> And heard and done, and seen done, and heard done,<br> Since you deserted me.  And tell me first<br> What the King thinks of me."--"The King believes<br> That you are almost what you are," he told her:<br> "The beauty of all ages that are vanished,<br> Reborn to be the wonder of one woman."--<br> "I knew he hated me.  What else of him?"--<br> "And all that I have seen and heard and done,<br> Which is not much, would make a weary telling;<br> And all your part of it would be to sleep,<br> And dream that Merlin had his beard again."--<br> "Then tell me more about your good fool knight,<br> Sir Dagonet.  If Blaise were not half-mad<br> Already with his pondering on the name<br> And shield of his unshielding nameless father,<br> I'd make a fool of him.  I'd call him Ajax;<br> I'd have him shake his fist at thunder-storms,<br> And dance a jig as long as there was lightning,<br> And so till I forgot myself entirely.<br> Not even your love may do so much as that."--<br> "Thunder and lightning are no friends of mine,"<br> Said Merlin slowly, "more than they are yours;<br> They bring me nearer to the elements<br> From which I came than I care now to be."--<br> "You owe a service to those elements;<br> For by their service you outwitted age<br> And made the world a kingdom of your will."--<br> He touched her hand, smiling: "Whatever service<br> Of mine awaits them will not be forgotten,"<br> He said; and the smile faded on his face.--<br> "Now of all graceless and ungrateful wizards--"<br> But there she ceased, for she found in his eyes<br> The first of a new fear.  "The wrong word rules<br> Today," she said; 'and we'll have no more journeys."<br> <br> Although he wandered rather more than ever<br> Since he had come again to Brittany<br> From Camelot, Merlin found eternally<br> Before him a new loneliness that made<br> Of garden, park, and woodland, all alike,<br> A desolation and a changelessness<br> Defying reason, without Vivian<br> Beside him, like a child with a black head,<br> Or moving on before him, or somewhere<br> So near him that, although he saw it not<br> With eyes, he felt the picture of her beauty<br> And shivered at the nearness of her being.<br> Without her now there was no past or future,<br> And a vague, soul-consuming premonition<br> He found the only tenant of the present;<br> He wondered, when she was away from him,<br> If his avenging injured intellect<br> Might shine with Arthur's kingdom a twin mirror,<br> Fate's plaything, for new ages without eyes<br> To see therein themselves and their declension.<br> Love made his hours a martyrdom without her;<br> The world was like an empty house without her,<br> Where Merlin was a prisoner of love<br> Confined within himself by too much freedom,<br> Repeating an unending exploration<br> Of many solitary silent rooms,<br> And only in a way remembering now<br> That once their very solitude and silence<br> Had by the magic of expectancy<br> Made sure what now he doubted--though his doubts,<br> Day after day, were founded on a shadow.<br> <br> For now to Merlin, in his paradise,<br> Had come an unseen angel with a sword<br> Unseen, the touch of which was a long fear<br> For longer sorrow that had never come,<br> Yet might if he compelled it.  He discovered,<br> One golden day in autumn as he wandered,<br> That he had made the radiance of two years<br> A misty twilight when he might as well<br> Have had no mist between him and the sun,<br> The sun being Vivian.  On his coming then<br> To find her all in green against a wall<br> Of green and yellow leaves, and crumbling bread<br> For birds around the fountain while she sang<br> And the birds ate the bread, he told himself<br> That everything today was as it was<br> At first, and for a minute he believed it.<br> "I'd have you always all in green out here,"<br> He said, "if I had much to say about it."--<br> She clapped her crumbs away and laughed at him:<br> "I've covered up my bones with every color<br> That I can carry on them without screaming,<br> And you have liked them all--or made me think so."--<br> "I must have liked them if you thought I did,"<br> He answered, sighing; "but the sight of you<br> Today as on the day I saw you first,<br> All green, all wonderful" . . . He tore a leaf<br> To pieces with a melancholy care<br> That made her smile.--"Why pause at 'wonderful'?<br> You've hardly been yourself since you came back<br> From Camelot, where that unpleasant King<br> Said things that you have never said to me."--<br> He looked upon her with a worn reproach:<br> "The King said nothing that I keep from you."--<br> "What is it then?" she asked, imploringly;<br> "You man of moods and miracles, what is it?"--<br> He shook his head and tore another leaf:<br> "There is no need of asking what it is;<br> Whatever you or I may choose to name it,<br> The name of it is Fate, who played with me<br> And gave me eyes to read of the unwritten<br> More lines than I have read.  I see no more<br> Today than yesterday, but I remember.<br> My ways are not the ways of other men;<br> My memories go forward.  It was you<br> Who said that we were not in tune with Time;<br> It was not I who said it."--"But you knew it;<br> What matter then who said it?"--"It was you<br> Who said that Merlin was your punishment<br> For being in tune with him and not with Time--<br> With Time or with the world; and it was you<br> Who said you were alone, even here with Merlin;<br> It was not I who said it.  It is I<br> Who tell you now my inmost thoughts."  He laughed<br> As if at hidden pain around his heart,<br> But there was not much laughing in his eyes.<br> They walked, and for a season they were silent:<br> "I shall know what you mean by that," she said,<br> "When you have told me.  Here's an oak you like,<br> And here's a place that fits me wondrous well<br> To sit in.  You sit there.  I've seen you there<br> Before; and I have spoiled your noble thoughts<br> By walking all my fingers up and down<br> Your countenance, as if they were the feet<br> Of a small animal with no great claws.<br> Tell me a story now about the world,<br> And the men in it, what they do in it,<br> And why it is they do it all so badly."--<br> "I've told you every story that I know,<br> Almost," he said.--"O, don't begin like that."--<br> "Well, once upon a time there was a King."--<br> "That has a more commendable address;<br> Go on, and tell me all about the King;<br> I'll bet the King had warts or carbuncles,<br> Or something wrong in his divine insides,<br> To make him wish that Adam had died young."<br> <br> Merlin observed her slowly with a frown<br> Of saddened wonder.  She laughed rather lightly,<br> And at his heart he felt again the sword<br> Whose touch was a long fear for longer sorrow.<br> "Well, once upon a time there was a king,"<br> He said again, but now in a dry voice<br> That wavered and betrayed a venturing.<br> He paused, and would have hesitated longer,<br> But something in him that was not himself<br> Compelled an utterance that his tongue obeyed,<br> As an unwilling child obeys a father<br> Who might be richer for obedience<br> If he obeyed the child: "There was a king<br> Who would have made his reign a monument<br> For kings and peoples of the waiting ages<br> To reverence and remember, and to this end<br> He coveted and won, with no ado<br> To make a story of, a neighbor queen<br> Who limed him with her smile and had of him,<br> In token of their sin, what he found soon<br> To be a sort of mongrel son and nephew--<br> And a most precious reptile in addition--<br> To ornament his court and carry arms,<br> And latterly to be the darker half<br> Of ruin.  Also the king, who made of love<br> More than he made of life and death together,<br> Forgot the world and his example in it<br> For yet another woman--one of many--<br> And this one he made Queen, albeit he knew<br> That her unsworn allegiance to the knight<br> That he had loved the best of all his order<br> Must one day bring along the coming end<br> Of love and honor and of everything;<br> And with a kingdom builded on two pits<br> Of living sin,--so founded by the will<br> Of one wise counsellor who loved the king,<br> And loved the world and therefore made him king<br> To be a mirror for it,--the king reigned well<br> For certain years, awaiting a sure doom;<br> For certain years he waved across the world<br> A royal banner with a Dragon on it;<br> And men of every land fell worshipping<br> The Dragon as it were the living God,<br> And not the living sin."<br> <br>                         She rose at that,<br> And after a calm yawn, she looked at Merlin:<br> "Why all this new insistence upon sin?"<br> She said; "I wonder if I understand<br> This king of yours, with all his pits and dragons;<br> I know I do not like him."  A thinner light<br> Was in her eyes than he had found in them<br> Since he became the willing prisoner<br> That she had made of him; and on her mouth<br> Lay now a colder line of irony<br> Than all his fears or nightmares could have drawn<br> Before today: "What reason do you know<br> For me to listen to this king of yours?<br> What reading has a man of woman's days,<br> Even though the man be Merlin and a prophet?"<br> <br> "I know no call for you to love the king,"<br> Said Merlin, driven ruinously along<br> By the vindictive urging of his fate;<br> "I know no call for you to love the king,<br> Although you serve him, knowing not yet the king<br> You serve.  There is no man, or any woman,<br> For whom the story of the living king<br> Is not the story of the living sin.<br> I thought my story was the common one,<br> For common recognition and regard."<br> <br> "Then let us have no more of it," she said;<br> "For we are not so common, I believe,<br> That we need kings and pits and flags and dragons<br> To make us know that we have let the world<br> Go by us.  Have you missed the world so much<br> That you must have it in with all its clots<br> And wounds and bristles on to make us happy--<br> Like Blaise, with shouts and horns and seven men<br> Triumphant with a most unlovely boar?<br> Is there no other story in the world<br> Than this one of a man that you made king<br> To be a moral for the speckled ages?<br> You said once long ago, if you remember,<br> 'You are too strange a lady to fear specks';<br> And it was you, you said, who feared them not.<br> Why do you look at me as at a snake<br> All coiled to spring at you and strike you dead?<br> I am not going to spring at you, or bite you;<br> I'm going home.  And you, if you are kind,<br> Will have no fear to wander for an hour.<br> I'm sure the time has come for you to wander;<br> And there may come a time for you to say<br> What most you think it is that we need here<br> To make of this Broceliande a refuge<br> Where two disheartened sinners may forget<br> A world that has today no place for them."<br> <br> A melancholy wave of revelation<br> Broke over Merlin like a rising sea,<br> Long viewed unwillingly and long denied.<br> He saw what he had seen, but would not feel,<br> Till now the bitterness of what he felt<br> Was in his throat, and all the coldness of it<br> Was on him and around him like a flood<br> Of lonelier memories than he had said<br> Were memories, although he knew them now<br> For what they were--for what his eyes had seen,<br> For what his ears had heard and what his heart<br> Had felt, with him not knowing what it felt.<br> But now he knew that his cold angel's name<br> Was Change, and that a mightier will than his<br> Or Vivian's had ordained that he be there.<br> To Vivian he could not say anything<br> But words that had no more of hope in them<br> Than anguish had of peace: "I meant the world . . .<br> I meant the world," he groaned; "not you--not me."<br> <br> Again the frozen line of irony<br> Was on her mouth.  He looked up once at it.<br> And then away--too fearful of her eyes<br> To see what he could hear now in her laugh<br> That melted slowly into what she said,<br> Like snow in icy water: "This world of yours<br> Will surely be the end of us.  And why not?<br> I'm overmuch afraid we're part of it,--<br> Or why do we build walls up all around us,<br> With gates of iron that make us think the day<br> Of judgment's coming when they clang behind us?<br> And yet you tell me that you fear no specks!<br> With you I never cared for them enough<br> To think of them.  I was too strange a lady.<br> And your return is now a speckled king<br> And something that you call a living sin--<br> That's like an uninvited poor relation<br> Who comes without a welcome, rather late,<br> And on a foundered horse."<br> <br>                           "Specks?  What are specks?"<br> He gazed at her in a forlorn wonderment<br> That made her say: "You said, 'I fear them not.'<br> 'If I were king in Camelot,' you said,<br> 'I might fear more than specks.'  Have you forgotten?<br> Don't tell me, Merlin, you are growing old.<br> Why don't you make somehow a queen of me,<br> And give me half the world?  I'd wager thrushes<br> That I should reign, with you to turn the wheel,<br> As well as any king that ever was.<br> The curse on me is that I cannot serve<br> A ruler who forgets that he is king."<br> <br> In his bewildered misery Merlin then<br> Stared hard at Vivian's face, more like a slave<br> Who sought for common mercy than like Merlin:<br> "You speak a language that was never mine,<br> Or I have lost my wits.  Why do you seize<br> The flimsiest of opportunities<br> To make of what I said another thing<br> Than love or reason could have let me say,<br> Or let me fancy?  Why do you keep the truth<br> So far away from me, when all your gates<br> Will open at your word and let me go<br> To some place where no fear or weariness<br> Of yours need ever dwell?  Why does a woman,<br> Made otherwise a miracle of love<br> And loveliness, and of immortal beauty,<br> Tear one word by the roots out of a thousand,<br> And worry it, and torture it, and shake it,<br> Like a small dog that has a rag to play with?<br> What coil of an ingenious destiny<br> Is this that makes of what I never meant<br> A meaning as remote as hell from heaven?"<br> <br> "I don't know," Vivian said reluctantly,<br> And half as if in pain; "I'm going home.<br> I'm going home and leave you here to wander,<br> Pray take your kings and sins away somewhere<br> And bury them, and bury the Queen in also.<br> I know this king; he lives in Camelot,<br> And I shall never like him.  There are specks<br> Almost all over him.  Long live the king,<br> But not the king who lives in Camelot,<br> With Modred, Lancelot, and Guinevere--<br> And all four speckled like a merry nest<br> Of addled eggs together.  You made him King<br> Because you loved the world and saw in him<br> From infancy a mirror for the millions.<br> The world will see itself in him, and then<br> The world will say its prayers and wash its face,<br> And build for some new king a new foundation.<br> Long live the King! . . . But now I apprehend<br> A time for me to shudder and grow old<br> And garrulous--and so become a fright<br> For Blaise to take out walking in warm weather--<br> Should I give way to long considering<br> Of worlds you may have lost while prisoned here<br> With me and my light mind.  I contemplate<br> Another name for this forbidden place,<br> And one more fitting.  Tell me, if you find it,<br> Some fitter name than Eden.  We have had<br> A man and woman in it for some time,<br> And now, it seems, we have a Tree of Knowledge."<br> She looked up at the branches overhead<br> And shrugged her shoulders.  Then she went away;<br> And what was left of Merlin's happiness,<br> Like a disloyal phantom, followed her.<br> <br> He felt the sword of his cold angel thrust<br> And twisted in his heart, as if the end<br> Were coming next, but the cold angel passed<br> Invisibly and left him desolate,<br> With misty brow and eyes.  "The man who sees<br> May see too far, and he may see too late<br> The path he takes unseen," he told himself<br> When he found thought again.  "The man who sees<br> May go on seeing till the immortal flame<br> That lights and lures him folds him in its heart,<br> And leaves of what there was of him to die<br> An item of inhospitable dust<br> That love and hate alike must hide away;<br> Or there may still be charted for his feet<br> A dimmer faring, where the touch of time<br> Were like the passing of a twilight moth<br> From flower to flower into oblivion,<br> If there were not somewhere a barren end<br> Of moths and flowers, and glimmering far away<br> Beyond a desert where the flowerless days<br> Are told in slow defeats and agonies,<br> The guiding of a nameless light that once<br> Had made him see too much--and has by now<br> Revealed in death, to the undying child<br> Of Lancelot, the Grail.  For this pure light<br> Has many rays to throw, for many men<br> To follow; and the wise are not all pure,<br> Nor are the pure all wise who follow it.<br> There are more rays than men.  But let the man<br> Who saw too much, and was to drive himself<br> From paradise, play too lightly or too long<br> Among the moths and flowers, he finds at last<br> There is a dim way out; and he shall grope<br> Where pleasant shadows lead him to the plain<br> That has no shadow save his own behind him.<br> And there, with no complaint, nor much regret,<br> Shall he plod on, with death between him now<br> And the far light that guides him, till he falls<br> And has an empty thought of empty rest;<br> Then Fate will put a mattock in his hands<br> And lash him while he digs himself the grave<br> That is to be the pallet and the shroud<br> Of his poor blundering bones.  The man who saw<br> Too much must have an eye to see at last<br> Where Fate has marked the clay; and he shall delve,<br> Although his hand may slacken, and his knees<br> May rock without a method as he toils;<br> For there's a delving that is to be done--<br> If not for God, for man.  I see the light,<br> But I shall fall before I come to it;<br> For I am old.  I was young yesterday.<br> Time's hand that I have held away so long<br> Grips hard now on my shoulder.  Time has won.<br> Tomorrow I shall say to Vivian<br> That I am old and gaunt and garrulous,<br> And tell her one more story: I am old."<br> <br> There were long hours for Merlin after that,<br> And much long wandering in his prison-yard,<br> Where now the progress of each heavy step<br> Confirmed a stillness of impending change<br> And imminent farewell.  To Vivian's ear<br> There came for many days no other story<br> Than Merlin's iteration of his love<br> And his departure from Broceliande,<br> Where Merlin still remained.  In Vivian's eye,<br> There was a quiet kindness, and at times<br> A smoky flash of incredulity<br> That faded into pain.  Was this the Merlin--<br> This incarnation of idolatry<br> And all but supplicating deference--<br> This bowed and reverential contradiction<br> Of all her dreams and her realities--<br> Was this the Merlin who for years and years<br> Before she found him had so made her love him<br> That kings and princes, thrones and diadems,<br> And honorable men who drowned themselves<br> For love, were less to her than melon-shells?<br> Was this the Merlin whom her fate had sent<br> One spring day to come ringing at her gate,<br> Bewildering her love with happy terror<br> That later was to be all happiness?<br> Was this the Merlin who had made the world<br> Half over, and then left it with a laugh<br> To be the youngest, oldest, weirdest, gayest,<br> And wisest, and sometimes the foolishest<br> Of all the men of her consideration?<br> Was this the man who had made other men<br> As ordinary as arithmetic?<br> Was this man Merlin who came now so slowly<br> Towards the fountain where she stood again<br> In shimmering green?  Trembling, he took her hands<br> And pressed them fondly, one upon the other,<br> Between his:<br> <br>             "I was wrong that other day,<br> For I have one more story.  I am old."<br> He waited like one hungry for the word<br> Not said; and she found in his eyes a light<br> As patient as a candle in a window<br> That looks upon the sea and is a mark<br> For ships that have gone down.  "Tomorrow," he said;<br> "Tomorrow I shall go away again<br> To Camelot; and I shall see the King<br> Once more; and I may come to you again<br> Once more; and I shall go away again<br> For ever.  There is now no more than that<br> For me to do; and I shall do no more.<br> I saw too much when I saw Camelot;<br> And I saw farther backward into Time,<br> And forward, than a man may see and live,<br> When I made Arthur king.  I saw too far,<br> But not so far as this.  Fate played with me<br> As I have played with Time; and Time, like me,<br> Being less than Fate, will have on me his vengeance.<br> On Fate there is no vengeance, even for God."<br> He drew her slowly into his embrace<br> And held her there, but when he kissed her lips<br> They were as cold as leaves and had no answer;<br> For Time had given him then, to prove his words,<br> A frozen moment of a woman's life.<br> <br> When Merlin the next morning came again<br> In the same pilgrim robe that he had worn<br> While he sat waiting where the cherry-blossoms<br> Outside the gate fell on him and around him<br> Grief came to Vivian at the sight of him;<br> And like a flash of a swift ugly knife,<br> A blinding fear came with it.  "Are you going?"<br> She said, more with her lips than with her voice;<br> And he said, "I am going.  Blaise and I<br> Are going down together to the shore,<br> And Blaise is coming back.  For this one day<br> Be good enough to spare him, for I like him.<br> I tell you now, as once I told the King,<br> That I can be no more than what I was,<br> And I can say no more than I have said.<br> Sometimes you told me that I spoke too long<br> And sent me off to wander.  That was good.<br> I go now for another wandering,<br> And I pray God that all be well with you."<br> <br> For long there was a whining in her ears<br> Of distant wheels departing.  When it ceased,<br> She closed the gate again so quietly<br> That Merlin could have heard no sound of it.<br>   <center>VII</center>  <br> <br> By Merlin's Rock, where Dagonet the fool<br> Was given through many a dying afternoon<br> To sit and meditate on human ways<br> And ways divine, Gawaine and Bedivere<br> Stood silent, gazing down on Camelot.<br> The two had risen and were going home:<br> "It hits me sore, Gawaine," said Bedivere,<br> "To think on all the tumult and affliction<br> Down there, and all the noise and preparation<br> That hums of coming death, and, if my fears<br> Be born of reason, of what's more than death.<br> Wherefore, I say to you again, Gawaine,--<br> To you--that this late hour is not too late<br> For you to change yourself and change the King:<br> For though the King may love me with a love<br> More tried, and older, and more sure, may be,<br> Than for another, for such a time as this<br> The friend who turns him to the world again<br> Shall have a tongue more gracious and an eye<br> More shrewd than mine.  For such a time as this<br> The King must have a glamour to persuade him."<br> <br> "The King shall have a glamour, and anon,"<br> Gawaine said, and he shot death from his eyes;<br> "If you were King, as Arthur is--or was--<br> And Lancelot had carried off your Queen,<br> And killed a score or so of your best knights--<br> Not mentioning my two brothers, whom he slew<br> Unarmored and unarmed--God save your wits!<br> Two stewards with skewers could have done as much,<br> And you and I might now be rotting for it."<br> <br> "But Lancelot's men were crowded,--they were crushed;<br> And there was nothing for them but to strike<br> Or die, not seeing where they struck.  Think you<br> They would have slain Gareth and Gaheris,<br> And Tor, and all those other friends of theirs?<br> God's mercy for the world he made, I say,<br> And for the blood that writes the story of it.<br> Gareth and Gaheris, Tor and Lamorak,--<br> All dead, with all the others that are dead!<br> These years have made me turn to Lamorak<br> For counsel--and now Lamorak is dead."<br> <br> "Why do you fling those two names in my face?<br> 'Twas Modred made an end of Lamorak,<br> Not I; and Lancelot now has done for Tor.<br> I'll urge no king on after Lancelot<br> For such a two as Tor and Lamorak:<br> Their father killed my father, and their friend<br> was Lancelot, not I.  I'll own my fault--<br> I'm living; and while I've a tongue can talk,<br> I'll say this to the King: 'Burn Lancelot<br> By inches till he give you back the Queen;<br> Then hang him--drown him--or do anything<br> To rid the world of him.'  He killed my brothers,<br> And he was once my friend.  Now damn the soul<br> Of him who killed my brothers!  There you have me."<br> <br> "You are a strong man, Gawaine, and your strength<br> Goes ill where foes are.  You may cleave their limbs<br> And heads off, but you cannot damn their souls;<br> What you may do now is to save their souls,<br> And bodies too, and like enough your own.<br> Remember that King Arthur is a king,<br> And where there is a king there is a kingdom.<br> Is not the kingdom any more to you<br> Than one brief enemy?  Would you see it fall<br> And the King with it, for one mortal hate<br> That burns out reason?  Gawaine, you are king<br> Today.  Another day may see no king<br> But Havoc, if you have no other word<br> For Arthur now than hate for Lancelot.<br> Is not the world as large as Lancelot?<br> Is Lancelot, because one woman's eyes<br> Are brighter when they look on him, to sluice<br> The world with angry blood?  Poor flesh!  Poor flesh!<br> And you, Gawaine,--are you so gaffed with hate<br> You cannot leave it and so plunge away<br> To stiller places and there see, for once,<br> What hangs on this pernicious expedition<br> The King in his insane forgetfulness<br> Would undertake--with you to drum him on?<br> Are you as mad as he and Lancelot<br> Made ravening into one man twice as mad<br> As either?  Is the kingdom of the world,<br> Now rocking, to go down in sound and blood<br> And ashes and sick ruin, and for the sake<br> Of three men and a woman?  If it be so,<br> God's mercy for the world he made, I say,--<br> And say again to Dagonet.  Sir Fool,<br> Your throne is empty, and you may as well<br> Sit on it and be ruler of the world<br> From now till supper-time."<br> <br>                            Sir Dagonet,<br> Appearing, made reply to Bedivere's<br> Dry welcome with a famished look of pain,<br> On which he built a smile: "If I were King,<br> You, Bedivere, should be my counsellor;<br> And we should have no more wars over women.<br> I'll sit me down and meditate on that."<br> Gawaine, for all his anger, laughed a little,<br> And clapped the fool's lean shoulder; for he loved him<br> And was with Arthur when he made him knight.<br> Then Dagonet said on to Bedivere,<br> As if his tongue would make a jest of sorrow:<br> "Sometime I'll tell you what I might have done<br> Had I been Lancelot and you King Arthur--<br> Each having in himself the vicious essence<br> That now lives in the other and makes war.<br> When all men are like you and me, my lord,<br> When all are rational or rickety,<br> There may be no more war.  But what's here now?<br> Lancelot loves the Queen, and he makes war<br> Of love; the King, being bitten to the soul<br> By love and hate that work in him together,<br> Makes war of madness; Gawaine hates Lancelot,<br> And he, to be in tune, makes war of hate;<br> Modred hates everything, yet he can see<br> With one damned illegitimate small eye<br> His father's crown, and with another like it<br> He sees the beauty of the Queen herself;<br> He needs the two for his ambitious pleasure,<br> And therefore he makes war of his ambition;<br> And somewhere in the middle of all this<br> There's a squeezed world that elbows for attention.<br> Poor Merlin, buried in Broceliande!<br> He must have had an academic eye<br> For woman when he founded Arthur's kingdom,<br> And in Broceliande he may be sorry.<br> Flutes, hautboys, drums, and viols.  God be with him!<br> I'm glad they tell me there's another world,<br> For this one's a disease without a doctor."<br> <br> "No, not so bad as that," said Bedivere;<br> The doctor, like ourselves, may now be learning;<br> And Merlin may have gauged his enterprise<br> Whatever the cost he may have paid for knowing.<br> We pass, but many are to follow us,<br> And what they build may stay; though I believe<br> Another age will have another Merlin,<br> Another Camelot, and another King.<br> Sir Dagonet, farewell."<br> <br>                        "Farewell, Sir Knight,<br> And you, Sir Knight: Gawaine, you have the world<br> Now in your fingers--an uncommon toy,<br> Albeit a small persuasion in the balance<br> With one man's hate.  I'm glad you're not a fool,<br> For then you might be rickety, as I am,<br> And rational as Bedivere.  Farewell.<br> I'll sit here and be king.  God save the King!"<br> <br> But Gawaine scowled and frowned and answered nothing<br> As he went slowly down with Bedivere<br> To Camelot, where Arthur's army waited<br> The King's word for the melancholy march<br> To Joyous Gard, where Lancelot hid the Queen<br> And armed his host, and there was now no joy,<br> As there was now no joy for Dagonet<br> While he sat brooding, with his wan cheek-bones<br> Hooked with his bony fingers: "Go, Gawaine,"<br> He mumbled: "Go your way, and drag the world<br> Along down with you.  What's a world or so<br> To you if you can hide an ell of iron<br> Somewhere in Lancelot, and hear him wheeze<br> And sputter once or twice before he goes<br> Wherever the Queen sends him?  There's a man<br> Who should have been a king, and would have been,<br> Had he been born so.  so should I have been<br> A king, had I been born so, fool or no:<br> King Dagonet, or Dagonet the King;<br> King-Fool, Fool-King; 'twere not impossible.<br> I'll meditate on that and pray for Arthur,<br> Who made me all I am, except a fool.<br> Now he goes mad for love, as I might go<br> Had I been born a king and not a fool.<br> Today I think I'd rather be a fool;<br> Today the world is less than one scared woman--<br> Wherefore a field of waving men may soon<br> Be shorn by Time's indifferent scythe, because<br> The King is mad.  The seeds of history<br> Are small, but given a few gouts of warm blood<br> For quickening, they sprout out wondrously<br> And have a leaping growth whereof no man<br> May shun such harvesting of change or death,<br> Or life, as may fall on him to be borne.<br> When I am still alive and rickety,<br> And Bedivere's alive and rational--<br> If he come out of this, and there's a doubt,--<br> The King, Gawaine, Modred, and Lancelot<br> May all be lying underneath a weight<br> Of bloody sheaves too heavy for their shoulders<br> All spent, and all dishonored, and all dead;<br> And if it come to be that this be so,<br> And if it be true that Merlin saw the truth,<br> Such harvest were the best.  Your fool sees not<br> So far as Merlin sees: yet if he saw<br> The truth--why then, such harvest were the best<br> I'll pray for Arthur; I can do no more."<br> <br> "Why not for Merlin?  Or do you count him,<br> In this extreme, so foreign to salvation<br> That prayer would be a stranger to his name?"<br> <br> Poor Dagonet, with terror shaking him,<br> Stood up and saw before him an old face<br> Made older with an inch of silver beard,<br> And faded eyes more eloquent of pain<br> And ruin than all the faded eyes of age<br> Till now had ever been, although in them<br> There was a mystic and intrinsic peace<br> Of one who sees where men of nearer sight<br> See nothing.  On their way to Camelot,<br> Gawaine and Bedivere had passed him by,<br> With lax attention for the pilgrim cloak<br> They passed, and what it hid: yet Merlin saw<br> Their faces, and he saw the tale was true<br> That he had lately drawn from solemn strangers.<br> <br> "Well, Dagonet, and by your leave," he said,<br> "I'll rest my lonely relics for a while<br> On this rock that was mine and now is yours.<br> I favor the succession; for you know<br> Far more than many doctors, though your doubt<br> Is your peculiar poison.  I foresaw<br> Long since, and I have latterly been told<br> What moves in this commotion down below<br> To show men what it means.  It means the end--<br> If men whose tongues had less to say to me<br> Than had their shoulders are adept enough<br> To know; and you may pray for me or not,<br> Sir Friend, Sir Dagonet."<br> <br>                          "Sir fool, you mean,"<br> Dagonet said, and gazed on Merlin sadly:<br> "I'll never pray again for anything,<br> And last of all for this that you behold--<br> The smouldering faggot of unlovely bones<br> That God has given to me to call Myself.<br> When Merlin comes to Dagonet for prayer,<br> It is indeed the end."<br> <br>                       "And in the end<br> Are more beginnings, Dagonet, than men<br> Shall name or know today.  It was the end<br> Of Arthur's insubstantial majesty<br> When to him and his knights the Grail foreshowed<br> The quest of life that was to be the death<br> Of many, and the slow discouraging<br> Of many more.  Or do I err in this?"<br> <br> "No," Dagonet replied; "there was a Light;<br> And Galahad, in the Siege Perilous,<br> Alone of all on whom it fell, was calm;<br> There was a Light wherein men saw themselves<br> In one another as they might become--<br> Or so they dreamed.  There was a long to-do,<br> And Gawaine, of all forlorn ineligibles,<br> Rose up the first, and cried more lustily<br> Than any after him that he should find<br> The Grail, or die for it,--though he did neither;<br> For he came back as living and as fit<br> For new and old iniquity as ever.<br> Then Lancelot came back, and Bors came back,--<br> Like men who had seen more than men should see,<br> And still come back.  They told of Percival<br> Who saw too much to make of this worn life<br> A long necessity, and of Galahad,<br> Who died and is alive.  They all saw Something.<br> God knows the meaning or the end of it,<br> But they saw Something.  And if I've an eye,<br> Small joy has the Queen been to Lancelot<br> Since he came back from seeing what he saw;<br> For though his passion hold him like hot claws,<br> He's neither in the world nor out of it.<br> Gawaine is king, though Arthur wears the crown;<br> And Gawaine's hate for Lancelot is the sword<br> That hangs by one of Merlin's fragile hairs<br> Above the world.  Were you to see the King,<br> The frenzy that has overthrown his wisdom,<br> Instead of him and his upheaving empire,<br> Might have an end."<br> <br>                    "I came to see the King,"<br> Said Merlin, like a man who labors hard<br> And long with an importunate confession.<br> "No, Dagonet, you cannot tell me why,<br> Although your tongue is eager with wild hope<br> To tell me more than I may tell myself<br> About myself.  All this that was to be<br> Might show to man how vain it were to wreck<br> The world for self if it were all in vain.<br> When I began with Arthur I could see<br> In each bewildered man who dots the earth<br> A moment with his days a groping thought<br> Of an eternal will, strangely endowed<br> With merciful illusions whereby self<br> Becomes the will itself and each man swells<br> In fond accordance with his agency.<br> Now Arthur, Modred, Lancelot, and Gawaine<br> Are swollen thoughts of this eternal will<br> Which have no other way to find the way<br> That leads them on to their inheritance<br> Than by the time-infuriating flame<br> Of a wrecked empire, lighted by the torch<br> Of woman, who, together with the light<br> That Galahad found, is yet to light the world."<br> <br> A wan smile crept across the weary face<br> Of Dagonet the fool: "If you knew that<br> Before your burial in Broceliande,<br> No wonder your eternal will accords<br> With all your dreams of what the world requires.<br> My master, I may say this unto you<br> Because I am a fool, and fear no man;<br> My fear is that I've been a groping thought<br> That never swelled enough.  You say the torch<br> Of woman and the light that Galahad found<br> Are some day to illuminate the world?<br> I'll meditate on that.  The world is done<br> For me; and I have been, to make men laugh,<br> A lean thing of no shape and many capers.<br> I made them laugh, and I could laugh anon<br> Myself to see them killing one another<br> Because a woman with corn-colored hair<br> Has pranked a man with horns.  'Twas but a flash<br> Of chance, and Lancelot, the other day<br> That saved this pleasing sinner from the fire<br> That she may spread for thousands.  Were she now<br> The cinder the King willed, or were you now<br> To see the King, the fire might yet go out;<br> But the eternal will says otherwise.<br> So be it; I'll assemble certain gold<br> That I may say is mine and get myself<br> Away from this accurst unhappy court,<br> And in some quiet place where shepherd clowns<br> And cowherds may have more respondent ears<br> Than kings and kingdom-builders, I shall troll<br> Old men to easy graves and be a child<br> Again among the children of the earth.<br> I'll have no more kings, even though I loved<br> King Arthur, who is mad, as I could love<br> No other man save Merlin, who is dead."<br> <br> "Not wholly dead, but old.  Merlin is old."<br> The wizard shivered as he spoke, and stared<br> Away into the sunset where he saw<br> Once more, as through a cracked and cloudy glass,<br> A crumbling sky that held a crimson cloud<br> Wherein there was a town of many towers<br> All swayed  and shaken, in a woman's hand<br> This time, till out of it there spilled and flashed<br> And tumbled, like loose jewels, town, towers, and walls,<br> And there was nothing but a crumbling sky<br> That made anon of black and red and ruin<br> A wild and final rain on Camelot.<br> He bowed, and pressed his eyes: "Now by my soul,<br> I have seen this before--all black and red--<br> Like that--like that--like Vivian--black and red;<br> Like Vivian, when her eyes looked into mine<br> Across the cups of gold.  A flute was playing--<br> Then all was black and red."<br> <br>                             Another smile<br> Crept over the wan face of Dagonet,<br> Who shivered in his turn.  "The torch of woman,"<br> He muttered, "and the light that Galahad found,<br> Will some day save us all, as they saved Merlin.<br> Forgive my shivering wits, but I am cold,<br> And it will soon be dark.  Will you go down<br> With me to see the King, or will you not?<br> If not, I go tomorrow to the shepherds.<br> The world is mad, and I'm a groping thought<br> Of your eternal will; the world and I<br> Are strangers, and I'll have no more of it--<br> Except you go with me to see the King."<br> <br> "No, Dagonet, you cannot leave me now,"<br> Said Merlin, sadly.  "You and I are old;<br> And, as you say, we fear no man.  God knows<br> I would not have the love that once you had<br> For me be fear of me, for I am past<br> All fearing now.  But Fate may send a fly<br> Sometimes, and he may sting us to the grave,<br> So driven to test our faith in what we see.<br> Are you, now I am coming to an end,<br> As Arthur's days are coming to an end,<br> To sting me like a fly?  I do not ask<br> Of you to say that you see what I see,<br> Where you see nothing; nor do I require<br> Of any man more vision than is his;<br> Yet I could wish for you a larger part<br> For your last entrance here than this you play<br> Tonight of a sad insect stinging Merlin.<br> The more you sting, the more he pities you;<br> And you were never overfond of pity.<br> Had you been so, I doubt if Arthur's love,<br> Or Gawaine's, would have made of you a knight.<br> No, Dagonet, you cannot leave me now,<br> Nor would you if you could.  You call yourself<br> A fool, because the world and you are strangers.<br> You are a proud man, Dagonet; you have suffered<br> What I alone have seen.  You are no fool;<br> And surely you are not a fly to sting<br> My love to last regret.  Believe or not<br> What I have seen, or what I say to you,<br> But say no more to me that I am dead<br> Because the King is mad, and you are old,<br> And I am older.  In Broceliande<br> Time overtook me as I knew he must;<br> And I, with a fond overplus of words,<br> Had warned the lady Vivian already,<br> Before these wrinkles and this hesitancy<br> Inhibiting my joints oppressed her sight<br> With age and dissolution.  She said once<br> That she was cold and cruel; but she meant<br> That she was warm and kind, and over-wise<br> For woman in a world where men see not<br> Beyond themselves.  She saw beyond them all,<br> As I did; and she waited, as I did,<br> The coming of a day when cherry-blossoms<br> Were to fall down all over me like snow<br> In springtime.  I was far from Camelot<br> That afternoon; and I am farther now<br> From her.  I see no more for me to do<br> Than to leave her and Arthur and the world<br> Behind me, and to pray that all be well<br> With Vivian, whose unquiet heart is hungry<br> For what is not, and what shall never be<br> Without her, in a world that men are making,<br> Knowing not how, nor caring yet to know<br> How slowly and how grievously they do it,--<br> Though Vivian, in her golden shell of exile,<br> Knows now and cares, not knowing that she cares,<br> Nor caring that she knows.  In time to be,<br> The like of her shall have another name<br> Than Vivian, and her laugh shall be a fire,<br> Not shining only to consume itself<br> With what it burns.  She knows not yet the name<br> Of what she is, for now there is no name;<br> Some day there shall be.  Time has many names,<br> Unwritten yet, for what we say is old<br> Because we are so young that it seems old.<br> And this is all a part of what I saw<br> Before you saw King Arthur.  When we parted,<br> I told her I should see the King again,<br> And, having seen him, might go back again<br> To see her face once more.  But I shall see<br> No more the lady Vivian.  Let her love<br> What man she may, no other love than mine<br> Shall be an index of her memories.<br> I fear no man who may come after me,<br> And I see none.  I see her, still in green,<br> Beside the fountain.  I shall not go back.<br> We pay for going back; and all we get<br> Is one more needless ounce of weary wisdom<br> To bring away with us.  If I come not,<br> The lady Vivian will remember me,<br> And say: 'I knew him when his heart was young,<br> Though I have lost him now.  Time called him home,<br> And that was as it was; for much is lost<br> Between Broceliande and Camelot.'"<br> <br> He stared away into the west again,<br> Where now no crimson cloud or phantom town<br> Deceived his eyes.  Above a living town<br> There were gray clouds and ultimate suspense,<br> And a cold wind was coming.  Dagonet,<br> Now crouched at Merlin's feet in his dejection,<br> Saw multiplying lights far down below,<br> Where lay the fevered streets.  At length he felt<br> On his lean shoulder Merlin's tragic hand<br> And trembled, knowing that a few more days<br> Would see the last of Arthur and the first<br> Of Modred, whose dark patience had attained<br> To one precarious half of what he sought:<br> "And even the Queen herself may fall to him,"<br> Dagonet murmured.--"The Queen fall to Modred?<br> Is that your only fear tonight?" said Merlin;<br> "She may, but not for long."--"No, not my fear;<br> For I fear nothing.  But I wish no fate<br> Like that for any woman the King loves,<br> Although she be the scourge and the end of him<br> That you saw coming, as I see it now."<br> Dagonet shook, but he would have no tears,<br> He swore, for any king, queen, knave, or wizard--<br> Albeit he was a stranger among those<br> Who laughed at him because he was a fool.<br> "You said the truth, I cannot leave you now,"<br> He stammered, and was angry for the tears<br> That mocked his will and choked him.<br> <br>                                     Merlin smiled,<br> Faintly, and for the moment: "Dagonet,<br> I need your word as one of Arthur's knights<br> That you will go on with me to the end<br> Of my short way, and say unto no man<br> Or woman that you found or saw me here.<br> No good would follow, for a doubt would live<br> Unstifled of my loyalty to him<br> Whose deeds are wrought for those who are to come;<br> And many who see not what I have seen,<br> Or what you see tonight, would prattle on<br> For ever, and their children after them,<br> Of what might once have been had I gone down<br> With you to Camelot to see the King.<br> I came to see the King,--but why see kings?<br> All this that was to be is what I saw<br> Before there was an Arthur to be king,<br> And so to be a mirror wherein men<br> May see themselves, and pause.  If they see not,<br> Or if they do see and they ponder not,--<br> I saw; but I was neither Fate nor God.<br> I saw too much; and this would be the end,<br> Were there to be an end.  I saw myself--<br> A sight no other man has ever seen;<br> And through the dark that lay beyond myself<br> I saw two fires that are to light the world."<br> <br> On Dagonet the silent hand of Merlin<br> Weighed now as living iron that held him down<br> With a primeval power.  Doubt, wonderment,<br> Impatience, and a self-accusing sorrow<br> Born of an ancient love, possessed and held him<br> Until his love was more than he could name,<br> And he was Merlin's fool, not Arthur's now:<br> "Say what you will, I say that I'm the fool<br> Of Merlin, King of Nowhere; which is Here.<br> With you for king and me for court, what else<br> Have we to sigh for but a place to sleep?<br> I know a tavern that will take us in;<br> And on the morrow I shall follow you<br> Until I die for you.  And when I die . . ."--<br> "Well, Dagonet, the King is listening."--<br> And Dagonet answered, hearing in the words<br> Of Merlin a grave humor and a sound<br> Of graver pity, "I shall die a fool."<br> He heard what might have been a father's laugh,<br> Faintly behind him; and the living weight<br> Of Merlin's hand was lifted.  They arose,<br> And, saying nothing, found a groping way<br> Down through the gloom together.  Fiercer now,<br> The wind was like a flying animal<br> That beat the two of them incessantly<br> With icy wings, and bit them as they went.<br> The rock above them was an empty place<br> Where neither seer nor fool should view again<br> The stricken city.  Colder blew the wind<br> Across the world, and on it heavier lay<br> The shadow and the burden of the night;<br> And there was darkness over Camelot.<br>
