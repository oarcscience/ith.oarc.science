## MERLIN'S LAST PROPHECY

### by

## GEORGE DARLEY

  
"Come ye from far, wild Ocean Daughters!  
Shell-borne on the dangerous sea,  
With pearly oars that ply the waters,  
Say, bright Strangers, whence ye be?"  
  
From a far Isle in unknown waters  
Fleeting like mist the windswept sea,  
We come--wise Merlin's potent Daughters,  
Morgain-le-fay's handmaidens we!  
  
Wide our gossamer sails unfurling,  
With coral prow we stem the spray,  
Our crisp shell behind us curling  
Keeps the plashy surge away.  
  
Fear not baleful charms or chidings,  
Sweet our words as dropping balm,  
Peace we bring and gentle tidings,  
Keep thy heart in holiest calm.  
  
The wild winds lull to our harps' soft numbers,  
Lo! when music meet our hands,  
Even the restless Ocean slumbers  
Hugely on his bed of sands.  
  
Lo! how swift our notes of pleasure  
Sparkle along the golden strings,  
While in rapturous mood and measure  
Her dulcet verse each Maiden sings.  
  
We o'er your land, like Guardian Spirits,  
From our far isle of Avalon,  
Watch, and o'er all that here inherits,  
Beautiful daughter and brave son.  
  
Favour to One grew strong and stronger,  
Who from her bright looks aye hath been  
Our Princess Fair-star: now no longer,  
But Britain's fair and starry Queen.  
  
Say to that young and sovran Beauty  
This message hymned to thee alone,  
Offering these gifts with proudest duty  
At the bright foot which gems her throne.  
  
Morgain to Britain's Queen commendeth  
This magic Trident, virtue-stored;  
Pendragon's Son, fair greeting, sendeth  
*Caliburn* , his enchanted sword.  
  
Rapt Merlin sings: "where a strengthless Woman  
This sceptre holds with a firm strain,  
That Land, maugre East and Western foeman,  
Shall rule both East and Western main.  
  
Where, with the same small clasp and slender,  
This sword pale Resolution draws,  
That Land need pray nought else defend her  
But grace of God and her good Cause!"  
  
Farewell!--the mortal arms that kept her  
Safe, thro' the Past, its rage might quell,  
But 'tis no common sword and sceptre  
Shall sway Futurity!--Farewell!
