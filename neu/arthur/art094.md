## FOR ALL LADIES OF SHALOTT

### by

## ALINE KILMER

  
  
The web flew out and floated wide.  
Poor lady! I was with her then.  
She gathered up her piteous pride,  
But she could never weave again.  
  
The mirror cracked from side to side;  
I saw its silver shadows go.  
"The curse has come on me!" she cried.  
Poor lady! I had told her so.  
  
She was so proud: she would not hide.  
She only laughed and tried to sing.  
But singing, in her song she died.  
*She did not profit anything.*
