It was a woefulle chance,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&As ever was in Christent&igrave;e.<br>  <br>  When the knighte found him wounded sore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And sawe the wild-worm hanginge there,<br>  His sworde he from his scabberde drewe;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&A piteous case, as ye shall heare.<br>  <br>  For when the two hostes sawe the sworde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&They joyned battayle instantlye;<br>  Till of soe manye noble knightes,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&On one side there were left but three.<br>  <br>  For all were slain that durst abide,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And but some fewe that fled awaye:<br>  Ay mee! it was a bloodye fielde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&As ere was foughte on a summer's daye.<br>  <br>  Upon King Arthur's own party&egrave;,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Onlye himselfe escaped there,<br>  And Lukyn Duke of Gloster free,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And the king's butler Bedevere.<br>  <br>  And when the king beheld his knightes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&All dead and scattered on the molde,<br>  The teares fast trickled downe his face;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&That manlye face in fight so bolde.<br>  <br>  "Nowe reste yee all, brave knights," he said,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"Soe true and faithful to your trust:<br>  And must ye then, ye valiant hearts,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Be lefte to moulder into dust!<br>  <br>  "Most loyal have yee been to mee,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Most true and faithful unto deathe:<br>  And, oh! to rayse yee up againe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&How freelye could I yield my breathe!<br>  <br>  "But see, the traitor's yet alive!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Lo where hee stalkes among the deade!<br>  Nowe bitterlye he shall abye:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And vengeance fall upon his head."<br>  <br>  "O staye, my liege," then sayd the duke;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"O staye for love and charit&igrave;e;<br>  Remember what the vision spake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Nor meete your foe, if it may bee."<br>  <br>  "O staye mee not, thou worthye wight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&This debt my loyal knights I owe:<br>  Betide my life, betide me death,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&I will avenge them of their foe."<br>  <br>  Then straite he grasp'd his trustye speare,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And on his horse then mounted hee:<br>  As his butler holpe him to his horse,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&His bowels gushed to his knee.<br>  <br>  "Alas!" then sayd the noble king,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"That I should live this sight to see!<br>  To see this good knight here be slaine,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&All for his love in helping mee!<br>  <br>  He put his speare into his reste.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And to Sir Mordred loud gan crye:<br>  "Nowe sette thyself upon thy guarde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&For, traitor, nowe thy death is nye."<br>  <br>  Sir Mordred lifted up his sworde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And fierce to meet the king ran hee:<br>  The king his speare he through him thrust,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&A fathom thorow his bod&igrave;e.<br>  <br>  When Mordered felt the stroke of death,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And found that he was wounded soe,<br>  He thrust himselfe upon the speare,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And strucke the king a deadlye blowe.<br>  <br>  Then grimmlye dyed Sir Mordered,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Presentlye upon that tree:<br>  And bloody streames ranne from the kinge,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Ere to the duke returned hee.<br>  <br>  Sir Lukyn then he thus bespake:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"Sir Knighte, thou hast been faithfulle tryde;<br>  Nowe take my sworde Excalibar,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&That hangs so freelye by my syde;<br>  <br>  "O take my sword Excalibar,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And there into the river throwe:<br>  For here, henceforth, benethe this tree,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&All use of weapons I forgoe.<br>  <br>  "And fare thee well, thou trustye sword,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp& A better neer had valiant knighte;<br>  With thee full ofte, and many a daye,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Have I withstood my foe in fighte.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&With this good fauchion in my hande,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Oft have I reapd the bloody feelde:<br>  But nowe the fatalle houre is come,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&That never more I may thee weelde."<br>  <br>  The duke to the river side he went,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And there his owne sword in threwe he;<br>  But he kept back Excalibar,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&He kept it back in privitie.<br>  <br>  For all of coleyne was the blade,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And all the hilte of precious stone:<br>  "And ever alacke!" then sayd the knighte,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"Must such a sword awaye be throwne?"<br>  <br>  Then backe he came unto the kinge,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Who sayd, Sir Lukyn, what did yee see?"<br>  "Nothing, my liege, save that the winde<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Blewe oer the waters faire and free."<br>  <br>  "O goe againe," then said the kinge,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"O good Sir Lukyn, goe againe:<br>  Into the rivere throwe my sword,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Nor keepe me lingering here in paine."<br>  <br>  The duke then to the river went,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And the kings scabberd in threwe hee;<br>  But he kept backe Excalibar,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And hid it undernethe a tree.<br>  <br>  Then backe he came to tell the kinge,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Who sayde, "Sir Lukyn, sawe ye oughte?"<br>  "Nothinge, my liege, save that the winde<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Nowe with the angrye waters fought."<br>  <br>  "O Lukyn, Lukyn," said the kinge,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&"Twice haste thou dealt deceytfullye:<br>  Alacke, whom may wee ever truste,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&When suche a knighte soe false can bee!<br>  <br>  "Saye, wouldst thou have thy master dead,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&All for a sword that wins thine eye?<br>  Now goe againe, and throwe it in,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Or here the one of us shall dye."<br>  <br>  The duke, all shent with this rebuke,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&No aunswere made unto the kinge;<br>  But to the rivere tooke the sworde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And threwe it far as he coulde flinge.<br>  <br>  A hande and an arme did meete the sworde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And flourishd three times in the air;<br>  Then sunke benethe the renninge streme,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And of the duke was seene noe mair.<br>  <br>  All sore astonied stood the duke,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&He stood as still, as still mote bee;<br>  Then hastened backe to telle the kinge,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&But he was gone from under the tree.<br>  <br>  But to what place he cold not tell,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&For never after hee did him spye;<br>  But hee sawe a barge goe from the land,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&And hee heard ladyes howle and crye.<br>  <br>  And whether the kinge were there or not,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Hee never knewe, nor ever colde,<br>  For from that sad and direfulle daye,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&Hee never more was seene on molde.<br>
