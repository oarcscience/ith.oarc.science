## THE SAN-GRAIL

### by

## ELLA YOUNG

  
Sir Lancelot rode between the trees,  
The evening sun was red:  
He thought upon Queen Guinevere  
With hair outspread.  
  
He thought upon the Holy Grail  
That he had come to win,  
And knew his love of Guinevere  
Was deadly sin.  
  
Then from his horse he lighted down  
Beneath the treen  
And prayed that God would sain his soul  
Of Arthur's queen.  
  
A sudden glory filled the wood,  
And there his eyes  
Beheld a wonder that had come  
From Paradise.  
  
He saw the Grail-Maid with the Grail  
Between her hands,  
The sight that is most beautiful  
In the world's lands.  
  
Full humbly Lancelot bowed himself  
Shamed and afraid  
But the Grail-Maiden said to him  
"Be not dismayed."  
  
"Look up," she said, "and see the Grail  
If thine eyes endure  
And if thy heart hath flame of love  
Through Love made pure."  
  
He lifted up his eyes if so  
The San-Grail might be found:  
The splendour smote him to the earth  
Deep in a swound.  
  
But through the swound Sir Lancelot knew  
The Grail-Maid stood  
Like a bright-coloured bird of Heaven  
In a dark wood.  
  
And he besought of Christ the Lord  
To lend him grace,  
Although he might not see the Grail,  
To see her face.  
  
"Look up," she said, "and see my face,  
The grace is won:  
Quenched in me now the moon-fire is  
And the fire of the sun."  
  
He looked upon the Grail-Maid's face  
Enshadowed by her hair:  
He knew her, wan, and white, and still,  
Queen Guinevere!
