## THE TRUE STORY OF GUENEVER

### by

## ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS

  
In all the wide, dead, old world of story, there is to me no wraith more
piteously pursuant than the wraith of Guenever. No other voice has in it
the ring of sweet harmonies so intricately bejangled; no other face
turns to us eyes of such luminous entreaty from slow descents of
despair; no other figure, majestic though in ruins, carries through
every strained muscle and tense nerve and full artery so magnetic a
consciousness of the deeps of its deserved humiliation the height of its
lost privilege. One pauses as before an awful problem, before the nature
of this miserable lady. A nature wrought, it is plain, of the finer
tissues, since it not only won but returned the love of the blameless
king. One follows her young years with bated breath. We see a delicate,
high-strung, impulsive creature, a trifle mismated to a faultless,
unimpulsive man. We shudder to discover in her, before she discovers it
for or in herself, that, having given herself to Arthur, she yet has not
given all; that there arises now another self, an existence hitherto
unknown, unsuspected,--a character groping, unstable, unable, a
wandering wind, a mist of darkness, a chaos, over which Arthur has no
empire, of which he has no comprehension, and of which she--whether of
Nature or of training who shall judge?--has long since discrowned
herself the Queen. Guenever is unbalanced, crude, primeval woman. She
must be at once passionately wooed and peremptorily ruled; and in wooing
or in ruling there must be no despondencies or declines. There are no
soundings to be found in her capacities of loving, as long as the
mariner cares to go on striking for them. At his peril let him hold his
plummet lightly or weary of the sweet toil taken in the measure of it;
at his peril, and at hers.  
     To Arthur love is a state, not a process; an atmosphere, not a
study; an assurance, not a hope; a fact, not an ideal. He is serene,
reflective, a statesman. The Queen is intense, ill-educated, idle.
Undreamed of by the one, unsuspected by the other, they grow apart.
Ungoverned, how shall Guenever govern herself? Misinterpreted, value
herself? Far upon the sunlit moor, a speck against the pure horizon,
Launcelot rides,--silent, subtle, swift, as Fate rides ever. . . .  
     Poor Guenever! After all, poor Guenever! Song and story, life and
death are so cruel to a woman. To Launcelot, repentant, is given in
later life the best thing left upon earth for a penitent man--a spotless
son. To Launcelot is reserved the aureola of that blessed fatherhood
from which sprang the finder of the Holy Grael, "pure in thought and
word and deed." To Guenever is given the convent and solitary expiation;
to Guenever disgrace, exile, and despair. Prone upon the convent floor,
our fancy leaves her, kissing Arthur's kingly and forgiving, but
departing feet, half dead for joy because he bids her hope that in some
other world--in which she has not sinned--those spotless feet may yet
return to her, her true and stronger soul return to him; but neither in
this world--never in this. Poor soul! Erring, weak, unclean; but for
that, and that, and that, poor soul! Poor soul! I can never bear to
leave her there upon the convent floor. I rebel against the story. I am
sure the half of it was never told us. It must be that Arthur went back
some autumn day and brought her gravely home. It *must* be that
penitence and patience and acquired purity shall sometime win the
respect and confidence of men, as they receive the respect and
confidence of God. It must be that at some distant but approaching day
*something* of the tenderness of divine stainlessness shall creep into
the instinct of human imperfection, and a repentant sinner become to
human estimates an object sorrowful, appalling, but appealing, sacred,
and sweet.  
     Who can capture the where, the how, the wherefore of a train of
fancy? Was it because I thought of Guenever that I heard the story? Or
because I heard the story that I thought of Guenever? My washwoman told
it, coming in the bitter day at twilight and sitting by the open fire,
as I had bidden her, for rest and warmth. What should *she* know of the
Bulfinch and Ellis and Tennyson and Dunlop, that had fallen from my lap
upon the cricket at her feet, that she should sit, with hands across her
draggled knees, and tell me such a story? Or were Dunlop and the rest
untouched upon the library shelves till after she had told it? Whether
the legend drew me to the fact, or the fact impelled me to the legend?
Indeed, why should I know? It is enough that I heard the story. She told
it in her way. I, for lack of her fine, realistic manner, must tell it
in my own.  
       
Queen Guenever had the toothache. Few people can look pretty with the
toothache. The cheeks of royalty itself will swell, and princely eyelids
redden, and queenly lips assume contours as unæsthetic as the
kitchen-maids', beneath affliction so plebeian. But Guenever looked
pretty.  
     She abandoned herself to misery, to begin with, in such a royal
fashion. And, by the way, we may notice that in nothing does blood
"tell" more sharply than in the endurance of suffering. There is a vague
monotony in the processes of wearing pleasure. Happy people are very
much alike. In the great republic of joy we find tremendous and
humiliating levels. When we lift our heads to bear the great crown of
pain, all the "points" of the soul begin to make themselves manifest at
once.  
     Guenever yielded herself to this vulgar agony with a beautiful
protest. She had protested, indeed, all winter, for that tooth had ached
all winter; had never even told her husband of it till yesterday. She
had flung herself upon the little crocheted cricket by the sitting-room
fire, with her slender, tightly-sleeved arm upon the chintz-covered
rocking-chair, and her erect, firm head upon her arm. Into the palm of
the other hand the offending cheek crept, like a bird into its nest;
with a caressing, nestling movement, as if that tiny hand of hers were
the only object in the world to which Guenever did not scorn to say how
sorry she was for herself. The color of her cheeks was high but fine.
Her eyes--Guenever, as we all know, had brown eyes, more soft than
dark--were as dry as they were iridescent. Other women might cry for the
toothache! All the curves of the exhausted attitude she had chosen, had
in them the bewitching defiance of a hard surrender to a power stronger
than herself, with which certain women meet every alien influence, from
a needle-prick to a heartbreak. She wore a white apron and a white
ribbon against a dress of a soft dark brown color; and the chintz of the
happy chair, whose stiff old elbows held her beautiful outline, was of
black and gold, with birds of paradise in the pattern. There was a
stove, with little sliding doors, in Guenever's sitting-room. Arthur
thought it did not use so very much more wood to open the doors, and was
far healthier. Secretly he liked to see Guenever in the bird-of-paradise
chair, with the moody firelight upon her; but he had never said so--it
was not Arthur's "way." Launcelot, now, for instance had said something
to that effect several times.  
     Launcelot, as all scholars of romantic fiction know, was the young
bricklayer to whom Arthur and Guenever had rented the spare room when
the hard times came on,--a good-natured, inoffensive lodger as one could
ask for, and quite an addition, now and then, before the little sliding
doors of the open stove, on a sober evening, when she and Arthur were
dull, as Guenever had said. To tell the truth, Arthur was often dull of
late, what with being out of work so much, and the foot he lamed with a
rusty nail. King Arthur, it is unnecessary to add, was a master
carpenter.  
     King Arthur came limping in that evening, and found the beautiful,
protesting, yielding, figure in the black and golden chair. The Queen
did not turn as he came in. One gets so used to one's husband! And the
heavy, uneven step he left upon the floor jarred upon her aching nerves.
Launcelot, when he had come, about an hour since, to inquire how she
was, had bounded down the stairs as merrily as a school-boy, as lightly
as a hare, and turned his knightly feet a-tip-toe as he crossed the room
to say how sorry he felt for her; to stand beside her in the moody
light, to gaze intently down upon her, then to ask why Arthur was not
yet at home; to wonder were she lonely; to say he liked her ribbon at
her throat; to say he liked a hundred things; to say it quite unmanned
him when he saw her suffer; to start as if he would say more to her, and
turn as if the would have touched her, and fly as if he dared not, and
out into the contending, mad March night. For the wind blew that night!
To the last night of her life Queen Guenever will not forget the way it
blew!  
     "Take some Drops," said Arthur. What a tiresome manner Arthur had
of putting things! Some Drops, indeed! There was nothing Guenever wanted
to take. She wanted, in fact, to *be* taken; to be caught and gathered
to her husband's safe, broad breast; to be held against his faithful
heart; to be fondled and crooned over and cuddled. She would have her
aching head imprisoned in his healthy hands. And if he should think to
kiss the agonizing cheek, as *she* would kiss a woman's cheek if she
loved her and she had the toothache? But Arthur never thought! Men were
so dull at things. Only women knew how to take care of one another. Only
women knew the infinite fine languages of love. A man was tender when he
thought of it, in a blunt, broad way.  
     There might be men-- One judged somewhat from voices; and a tender
voice-- Heaven forgive her! Though he spoke with the tongues of all
angels, and the music of all spheres, and the tenderness of all loves,
what was any man's mortal voice to her--a queen, the wife of Arthur,
blameless king of men?  
     The wife of Arthur started from the old chair whereon the birds of
paradise seemed in the uneven firelight to be fluttering to and fro. The
color on her cheeks had deepened painfully, and she lifted her crowned
head with a haughty motion towards her husband's face.  
     "I'm sure I'd try the Drops," repeated Arthur.  
     "I'll have it out!" snapped Guenever. "I don't believe a word of
its being neuralgia. I'll have them all out, despite him!"  
     Guenever referred to the court dentist.  
     "I'll have them out and make a fright of myself once for all, and
go mumbling round. I doubt if anybody would find it made any difference
to anybody how anybody looked."  
     It cannot be denied that there was a certain remote vagueness in
this remark. King Arthur, who was of a metaphysical temperament, sighed.
He was sorry for the Queen--so sorry that he went and set the
supper-table, to save her from the draughts that lurked even in the
royal pantry that mad March night. He loved the Queen--so much that he
would have been a happy man to sit in the bird-of-paradise rocking-chair
and kiss that aching, sweet cheek of hers till supper-time to-morrow, if
that would help her. But he supposed, if she had the toothache, she
wouldn't want to be touched. He knew he shouldn't. So, not knowing what
else to do, he just limped royally about and got the supper, like a dear
old dull king as he was.  
     If Queen Guenever appreciated this little kingly attention, who can
say? She yielded herself with a heavy sigh once more to the arms of the
chintz rocking-chair, and ached in silence. Her face throbbed in time to
the pulses of the wind. What a wind it was! It seemed to come from
immense and awful distances, gathering slow forces as it fled, but
fleeing with a compressed, rebellious roar, like quick blood chained
within the tissues of a mighty artery, beating to and fro as it rushed
to fill the heart of the black and lawless night.  
     It throbbed so resoundingly against the palace windows that the
steps of Launcelot, blending with it, did not strike the Queen's ears
till he stood beside her, in the firelight. Arthur, setting the supper
table, had heard the knightly knock, and bidden their friend and lodger
enter (as King Arthur bade him always) with radiant, guileless eyes.  
     Sir Launcelot had a little bottle in his hand. He had been to the
druggist's. There was a druggist to the king just around the corner from
the palace.  
     "It's laudanum," said Launcelot. "I got it for your tooth. I wish
you'd try it. I couldn't bear to see you suffer."  
     "I'm half afraid to have Guenever take laudanum," said Arthur,
coming up. "It takes such a mite of anything to influence my wife. The
doctor says it is her nerves. I know he wouldn't give her laudanum when
her arm was hurt. But it's just as good in you, Sir Launcelot."  
     Guenever thought it very good in him. She lifted her flushed and
throbbing face to tell him so; but, in point of fact, she told him
nothing. For something in Sir Launcelot's eyes, the wife of Arthur could
not speak.  
     She motioned him to put the bottle on the shelf, and signified by a
slight gesture peculiar to herself--a little motion of the shoulders, as
tender as it was imperious--her will that he should leave her.  
     Now Launcelot, we see, was plainly sorry for Guenever. Was it then
a flitting tenderer than sorrow that she had seen within his knightly
eyes? Only Guenever will ever know; for Arthur, on his knees upon the
crocheted cricket before the palace fire, was toasting graham bread.  
     Guenever, on her knees before the rocking-chair, sat very still.
Her soft brown eyes, wide open, almost touched the cool, smooth chintz
where the birds of paradise were flying on a pall-black sky. It seemed
to her strained vision, sitting so, that the birds flew from her as she
looked at them, and vanished; and that the black sky alone was left. The
eyes that watched the golden birds departing were fair and still, like
the eyes of children just awake. It was a child's mouth, as innocent and
fair, that Guenever lifted just that minute suddenly to Arthur, with a
quick, unqueenly, appealing smile.  
     "Kiss me, dear?" said Guenever, somewhat disconnectedly.  
     "Why, yes!" said Arthur.  
     He was n't able to follow the train of thought exactly. It was
never clear to him why Guenever should want to be kissed precisely in
the *middle* of a slice of toast. And the graham bread was burned. But
he kissed the Queen, and they had supper; and he eat the burnt slice
himself, and said nothing about it. That, too, was one of Arthur's
"ways."  
     "Only," said Guenever, as the King contentedly finished the last
black crust, "I wish the wind would stop."  
     "What's the trouble with the wind?" asked Arthur. "I thought it was
well enough."  
     "It must be well enough," said the Queen, and she shook her little
white fist at the window. "It *shall* be well enough!"  
     For the pulse of the wind ran wildly against the palace and
Guenever was speaking, and throbbed and bounded and beat, as if the
heart of the March night would break.  
     All this was long, long, long ago. How long Guenever can never
tell. Days, weeks, months,--few or many, swift or slow,--of that she
cannot answer. Passion takes no count of time; peril marks no hours or
minutes; wrong makes its own calendar; and misery has solar systems
peculiar to itself. It seemed to her years, it seemed to her days,
according to her tossed, tormented mood.  
     It is in the nature of all passionate and uncontrolled emotion to
prey upon and weaken the forces of reflective power, as much as it is in
the nature of controlled emotion to strengthen them. Guenever found in
herself a marked instance of this law. It seemed to her sometimes that
she knew as little of her own story as she did of that of any erring
soul at the world's width from her. It seemed to her that her very
memory had yielded in the living of it, like the memory of a person in
whose brain insidious disease had begun to fasten itself. So subtle and
so sure had been the disease which gnawed at the Queen's heart, that she
discovered with a helpless terror--not unlike that one might feel in
whom a cancerous process had been long and undetected working--that her
whole nature was lowering its tone in sympathy with her special
weakness. She seemed suddenly to have become, or to feel herself become,
a poisoned thing.  
     We may wonder, does not the sense of guilt--not the sensitiveness
to, but the sense of guilt--come often as a sharp and sudden experience?
Queen Guenever, at least, felt stunned by it. Distinctly, as if it and
she were alone in the universe, she could mark the awful moment when it
came to her. Vivid as a blood-red rocket shot against her stormy sky,
that moment whirred and glared before her.  
     It was a fierce and windy night, like that in which she had the
toothache, when she and the King had eaten such a happy supper of burnt
toast (for *hers* was burnt, too, although she wouldn't have said so for
the world, since the King had got so tired and warm about it). How happy
they had been that night! Sir Launcelot did not come again after supper,
dimly feeling, despite the laudanum, that the Queen had dismissed him
for the evening. She and Arthur had the evening to themselves. It was
the first evening they had been alone together for a long time. Arthur
sat in the chintz rocking-chair. He held her in his lap. He comforted
her poor cheek with his huge, warm hand. His shining, kingly eyes looked
down on her like stars from Heaven. He said:--  
     "If it wasn't for your tooth, little woman, how happy we would
be."  
     And Guenever had laughed and said: "What's a toothache? I'm
content, if you are." And then they laughed together, and the golden
birds upon the old chair had seemed to flit and sing before her; and
brighter and sweeter, as they watched her, glimmered Arthur's guileless
eyes.  
     The stars were fallen now; the heavens were black; the birds of
paradise had flown; the wind was abroad mightily and cold; there was
snow upon the ground; and she and Launcelot were fleeing through it and
weeping as they fled.  
     Guenever, at least, was weeping. All the confusion of the miserable
states and processes which had led her to this hour had cleared away,
murky clouds from a lurid sky. Suddenly, by a revelation awful as some
that might shock a soul upon the day of doom, she knew that she was no
longer a bewildered or a pitiable, but an evil creature.  
     A gossip in the street, an old neighbor who used to borrow eggs of
her, had spoken in her hearing, as she and Launcelot passed swiftly
through the dark, unrecognized, at the corner of the Palace Court, and
had said:--  
     "Guenever has fled with Launcelot. The Queen has left the King. All
the world will know it by to-morrow."  
     These words fell upon the Queen's ear distinctly. They tolled after
her through the bitter air. She fled a few steps, and stopped.  
     "Launcelot!" she cried, "what have we done? Why are we here? Let me
go home! Oh! what have I done?"  
     She threw out her arms with that tender, imperious gesture of
hers--more imperious than tender now--which Launcelot knew so well.  
     Strange! Oh! strange and horrible! How came it to be thus with her?
How came she to be alone with Launcelot in the blinding night? *The
Queen fled from the King? Guenever false to Arthur?*  
     Guenever, pausing in the cruel storm, looked backward at her
footsteps in the falling snow. Her look was fixed and frightened as a
child's. Her memory seemed to her like snow of all that must have led
her to this hour.  
     She knew not what had brought her hither, nor the way by which she
came. She was a creature awakened from a moral catalepsy. With the
blessed impulse of the Prodigal, old as Earth's error, sweet as Heaven's
forgiveness, she turned and cried: "I repent! I repent! I will go home
to my husband, before it is too late!"  
     "It is too late!" said a bitter voice beside her. "It is too late
already for repentance, Guenever."  
     Was it Launcelot who spoke, or the deadly wind that shrieked in
passing her? Guenever could never say. A sickening terror took
possession of her. She felt her very heart grow cold, as she stood and
watched her foot-prints, on which the snow was falling wild and fast.  
     It was a desolate spot in which she and Launcelot stood. They had
left the safe, sweet signs of holy human lives and loves behind them.
They were quite alone. A wide and windy moor stretched from them to a
forest, on which a horror of great darkness seemed to hang. Behind them,
in the deserted distance, gleamed the palace lights. Within these the
Queen saw, or fancied that she saw, the shadow of the King, moving sadly
to and fro, against the drawn curtain, from behind which the birds of
paradise had fled forever.  
     From palace to wilderness her footsteps lay black in the falling
snow. As she gazed, the increasing storm drifted, and here and there
they blurred and whitened over and were lost to sight.  
     So she, too, would whiten over her erring way. Man was not more
merciless than Nature.  
     "I will retrace them all!" cried Guenever.  
     "You can never retrace the first of them," said again bitterly
beside her Launcelot or the deathly wind. "Man is more merciless than
Nature. There is no way back for you to the palace steps. In all the
kingdom, there is no soul to bid you welcome, should you dare return.
The Queen can never come to her throne again."  
     "I seek no throne!" wailed Guenever. "I ask for no crown! All I
want is to go back and to be clean. I'll crawl on my knees to the
palace, if I may be clean."  
     But again said sneeringly to her that voice, which was either of
Launcelot or of the wind:--  
     "Too late! too late! too late! You can never be clean! You can
never be clean!"  
     "Launcelot," said Guenever, rallying sharply and making as it
seemed, a mighty effort to collect control over the emotion which was
mastering her, "Launcelot, there is some mistake about this. I never
meant to do wrong. I never said I would leave the King. There is some
mistake. Perhaps I have been dreaming or have been ill. Let me go home
at once to the King!"  
     "There is no mistake," said once more the voice, which seemed
neither of Launcelot nor of the wind, but yet akin to both; "and you are
not dreaming and you can never return to the King. The thing that is
done is done. Sorrow and longing are dead to help you. Agony and
repentance are feeble friends. Neither man nor Nature can wash away a
stain."  
     "God is more merciful!" cried Guenever, in the tense, shrill voice
of agony, stung beyond endurance. It seemed to her that nature could
bear no more. It seemed to her that she had never before this moment
received so much as an intellectual perception of the guiltiness of
guilt. Now mind and heart, soul and body throbbed with the throes of it.
She quivered, she struggled, she rebelled with the accumulated fervors
and horrors of years of innocence. But it seemed to her as if the soil
of sin eat into her like caustic, before whose effects the most
compassionate or skillful surgeon is powerless. She writhed with her
recoil from it. She shrank from it with terror proportioned to her sense
of helplessness and stain.  
     "They who are only afflicted know nothing of misery!" moaned
Guenever. "There *is* no misery but guilt!"  
     She flung herself down in the storm upon the snow.  
     "God loves!" cried Guenever. "Christ died! I *will* be clean!"  
     It seemed then suddenly to the kneeling woman, that He whose body
and blood were broken for tempted souls appeared to seek her out across
the desolated moor. The Man whose stainless lips were first to touch the
cup of the Holy Grael, which all poor souls should after Him go seeking
up and down upon the earth, stood in the pure white snow, and, smiling,
spoke to her.  
      *"Though your sins,"* he said, *"are scarlet, they shall be
white."*  
     He pointed, as he spoke, across the distance; past the safe, sweet
homes of men and women, toward the palace gates. It seemed to Guenever
that he spoke again and said:--  
     "Return!"  
     "Through those black footsteps?" sobbed the Queen.  
     But when she looked again, behold! each black and bitter trace was
gone. Smooth across them all, fair, pure, still, reposed the stainless
snow. She could not find them, though she would. They were blotted out
by Nature, as they were forgiven of God. Alas! alas! if man were but
half as compassionate or kind. If Arthur--  
     She groveled on the ground where the sacred Feet had stood, which
now were vanished from her. Wretched woman that she was! Who should
deliver her from this bondage to her life's great holy love? If Arthur
would but open the door for her in the fair distance, where the palace
window shone; if he would take a single step toward her where she
kneeled within the wilderness; if he would but loiter toward her where
that Other had run swiftly, and speak one word of quiet to her where He
had sung her songs of joy! But the palace door was shut. The King took
no step toward the wilderness. The King was mute as death and cold as
his own white soul. On Arthur's throne was never more a place for
Guenever.  
     Guenever, in the desert, stretched her arms out blindly across the
blotted footprints to the palace lights.  
     Oh! Arthur. Oh! Arthur, Arthur, *Arthur* . . .

     "Why, Pussy!" said Arthur. "What's the matter?"  
     However unqueenly, Pussy was one of the royal pet names.  
     "My little woman! Guenever! My darling! Why do you call me so?"  
     Why did she call him indeed? Why call for anything?  
     Why ask or need or long? In his great arms he held her. To his true
breast he folded her. Safe in his love he sheltered her. From heaven the
stars of his eyes looked down on her. As those may look who wake in
heaven, whose anguished soul had thought to wake in hell, looked
Guenever. She was his honored wife. There was no Launcelot, no
wilderness. The soul which the King had crowned with his royal love was
clean, was clean, was clean!  
     She hid her scarlet face upon his honest heart and seemed to mutter
something about "dreams." It was all that she could say. There are
dreams that are epochs in life.  
     "But it wasn't a dream, you see," said Arthur. "We've had a scare
over you, Guenever. You took the laudanum, after all."  
     "Launcelot's laudanum! Indeed, no! I took the drops, as I told you,
Arthur."  
     "The bottles stood together on the shelf, and you made the
blunder," said Arthur, anxiously. "We think you must have taken a
tremendous dose. I've sent Launcelot for the Doctor. And Nabby Jones,
she was in to borrow eggs, and she said a little camphire would be good
for you. She just went home to get it. But I've been frightened about
you, Guenever," said Arthur. Arthur spoke in his own grave and repressed
manner. But he was very pale. His lips, as the Queen crept, sobbing, up
to touch them, trembled.  
     "Well, well," he said, "we won't talk about it now." Guenever did
not want to talk. She wished Nabby Jones would stay away, with her
camphire. She wished Launcelot would never come. Upon her husband's
heart she lay. Within her husband's eyes the safe, home fire-light
shone. Across the old chintz chair the birds of paradise were fluttering
like birds gone wild with joy.  
     Without, the wind had lulled, the storm had ceased, and through the
crevices in the windows had sifted tiny drifts of cool, clean snow.  
     And this, know all men henceforth by these presents, is the true
story of Guenever the Queen.
