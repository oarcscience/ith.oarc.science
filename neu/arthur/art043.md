### **THE TRAGEDY OF ETARRE**

  
  
                    **PROLOGUE**  
  
*SCENE: The curtain rises upon shifting fog-clouds  
     which drive across the stage in ceaseless unrest.  
     * GAWAINE *is half visible, struggling against  
     the grey drift.*  
  
                    GAWAINE  
Is this the dawn whose fingers strive so weak  
To pluck away the clinging shroud of night,  
Or is this some unlightened, sullen land  
Fallen between the darkness and the day?  
Back from me, shrouded phantoms, misty sprites!  
This is no time to whirl your shadow-dance:  
Seek out the flooded marshes of the North  
If ye would revel; seek the sunless heights  
And laugh along their chasms and dark ravines,  
Or frown and lower on plain of gloomy lakes,  
Or battle with the giants of the hills.  
                         \[ *He unsheathes his sword* .\]  
Since ye have shape and substance, fear this blade.  
Shifting and mocking though ye vex mine eyes,  
Yet are ye more than breath of mindless air,  
For here I see your bodies' countenance  
That leers against me, stupid mouth ajar,  
And there I see your clutching hands which stretch  
With boneless fingers, snatching at the wind.  
                         \[ *He strikes.* \]  
Lo, how I cleft thee, shuddering breast and waist  
From formless nether-limbs! Thy silly strength  
Is thistle-down that's harried by the storm,  
Or rain-drop's airy bubble threatening  
With tiny voice the clarion-mouthèd sea.  
Give way, weak phantom-thoughts of impotence,  
Less real than clouded dreams that fall and break  
In splintered crystals of awakening.  
Grey-blooded, mirthless things that toss and fret,  
I drive you back before me, void and vain.  
\[ *He disappears in the fog, cleaving with his sword  
     the clouds which press in on every side. From  
     the unseen background are heard three voices  
     singing.* \]  
                         SONG  
     Children of the misty plain,  
     Creatures wrought of cloud and rain,  
     Shadowed phantoms of the brain  
         Of the dreaming earth,  
     Fade and vanish! in the sun  
     All your magic is undone,  
     All your charmèd webs unspun,  
         Tangles little worth,  
     Tattered shreds and wisps of grey  
     By the breezes swept away,  
     Smitten by the swords of day.  
         \[ *During the song the fog has begun to clear.* \]  
     Fade and vanish, take you hence,  
     Loose your revel, break your spell,  
     Crush the heaven's lightless shell;  
     Hidden in the magic well,  
         Held enfettered by our thrall,  
     Move no wing and stir no sense,  
         Bide imprisoned till we call.  
                         \[ *The fog has entirely cleared.* \]  
  
*SCENE: A woodland pool, about which stand three  
     maidens, the first of whom is young, the second  
     in the mid of life, the third old, with grey-  
     streaked hair. The trees show autumn leafage.  
     Early morning.*  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What sprites are ye that weave a riddled song  
Whereby the very forces of the sky  
Are held enmeshed in sure obedience?  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
Draw near and hearken to our speech,  
   For we have wonders on our lips  
     And work strange magic with our tongue.  
  
                   THE SECOND  
On sable reef and golden beach  
   By will of us sea-things and ships  
     In wrack of wind and wave are flung.  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
The fingers of our fortune reach  
   From moon to sun and work eclipse  
     Whereby dead stars are fashioned young.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What wild black speech is this of sun and star,  
And what have ye to do with ruined ships?  
Are ye the devil's handmaids working grief  
Against the sunlit ways of God?  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
                           We guard:  
Ours is a sacred heritage.  
  
                   THE SECOND  
                           We wait:  
Ours is a dark fulfillment.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
                           We attain:  
For we are one with all that moves and is.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What ye attain I know not, why ye wait  
Is hidden till the waiting hour be done,  
And what ye guard I see not, yet am fain  
To snatch this knowledge from your flying speech  
As feather stricken from a fleeing bird.  
                         \[ *He approaches the three* \]  
  
                   THE SECOND  
The plume that flutters down the tired wind  
Is not more idly grasped, nor with less toil  
Attained, than is the secret of our word.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Is this a spring wherein the fair water lies,  
Or but illusion's round, some silver gleam  
Caught up and pent within the hoop of night,  
A mirror wrought of nothing? Nay, but here  
Is water welcome to the thirsty mouth!  
I pray you by all holy thoughts and names  
Give me to drink! Three days of wandering  
Have parched my lips and snapped my strength in twain.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
The well of strange adventure: whoso drinks  
Shall fill the changing pages of his deeds  
With words of written wonder.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                         And the king  
Has nought of higher praise to give his knights  
Than this: "They sought adventure and attained."  
Give me to drink. Alone and without steed,  
Wearied with hunger, stricken with fatigue,  
I take upon me danger, toil, and strife,  
And drink adventure with an eager mouth;  
For I am Gawaine, and of Arthur's court!  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
Before that hour when over stony ways  
Thy steed was broken, never in the lists  
To run against the wind with nostrils wide  
Or stand again the shock of breaking spears,  
Before, alone in wood and tangled glade,  
Thy feet strove sadly, seeking hermitage,  
We knew of Gawaine, dreaming he would come  
And beg a draught to quench his bitter thirst.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What tale is this? Ye knew that I should come?  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
Yea, 'twas our knowledge that this thing should be.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Beneath gold raiment lurks deceptive heart  
And too-great knowledge is a mask for ill.  
I fear you that are fair of face, and wise  
Beyond all proper wisdom of mankind.  
God and the devil's workers are alone  
In such foreknowledge.  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
                           Find no fear of us.  
This was a dream: we are beset with dreams.  
What faults of ours if they be always true?  
We cannot guide our dreams, they are of God.  
  
                   THE SECOND  
We are the warders of a deathless source.  
Draw near and drink, and have no further fear.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
We give, yet give not save for gift's return.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What will ye of me?  
  
                   THE SECOND  
                           That which all must give,  
Judgement between us of his true desire.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
The shrouds of clinging words are yet undrawn,  
And deep enfolded lies the inner wish:  
I know not what ye say, nor what ye will.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
No colours of strange magic hide our speech.  
The well of strange adventure: whoso drinks  
Shall choose between us whom his true desire  
Would make companion in the day of deeds.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Is this the price wherewith a draught is paid?  
Small price and quickly given. Yet to choose  
Vexes the spirit with a running doubt  
That will not rest.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
                           Nay, drink thy draught,  
And when the clamour of the hounds of thirst  
Has ceased above its quarry, and thy lips  
Are drinking in their long-sought sustenance,  
Perchance thy spirit's fire shall rise again  
Until the lamp of judgement shall be light  
Within thy mind, to cast its faultless shine  
Upon our waiting and release thy doubt.  
  
                   THE SECOND  
Loosen thy helm and make of it thy bowl,  
Thy silver goblet dipping crystal wine.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
The subtle threads of water twist and spin  
And will not be contained within a helm.  
  
                   THE SECOND  
Nay, make thy trial.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                           If there be magic here,  
Perchance the helm will hold the dwindling weight;  
Else is it vain. Yet let my hands essay  
What soul and body thirst for; and ye streams  
Of shadowed water, lend your kindly aid.  
\[ *He looses his helmet and dips it into the well until it  
       is filled to the brim. He raises it to his lips,  
       and, stooping above it, drinks long.* \]  
Through all the barren chambers of my soul  
There went the sound of music and a voice  
That woke the silence with a song of life;  
And my own spirit sang. Through open doors  
Came breath of springtime, earth's awakening,  
The resurrection from the graves of sleep.  
Look down, look down; the water at thy feet  
Is troubled with the coming of a dream.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
\[ *Gawaine bends over the well and stares into its depths.* \]  
What world of changing pageants here is hid?  
Across the mirrored passage of the well  
Move bright processions, glittering array  
Of bannered knights and charging battle-fields.  
The shift like oil on silent rivers borne  
And blend quick colours caught from rainbow heights  
With gold and silver pride of broidered silks  
Precious beyond all treasured count of wealth.  
                           \[ *He remains, staring spellbound.* \]  
The armies pass, and now again the sky  
Lies here reflected, and the shaded trees  
Bring silence with their canopy of green.  
There sped a swallow like a gleam of grey,  
And here the wind went laughing through the leaves.  
The magic show has passed.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
                                              It will renew.  
Some fuller vision draws across the depths.  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
What seest thou, O Gawaine? for mine eyes  
Are not as are my sister's, keen to mark  
From farthest bounds the uttermost approach,  
And in quick vision versed; yet mine retain  
Their memories, unfaded for all time.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
An armoured knight in shameful wise is borne  
Bound to the belly of a drooping steed;  
Three sorry knaves of little stature drag  
Th' unwilling bridle. Now the dream is passed.  
What sight was this? what riddle of a world  
Where men are pictures on the water's shield,  
And things go by without our minds' control  
Like scattered dreams when body's maladies  
Assail the brain and make of it their toy?  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
This is thy future: time's processional  
Moves ever through the water's mirrored depth,  
And he who drinks may gain a broken glimpse  
Within the endless change of shape and form  
Wherewith the false, illusive world of sense  
Doth clothe itself in unreality.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Am I that knight, in wretched manner bound?  
Shall others drag me at their bridle's will?  
Would I were slain in battle, ere such fate  
Had darkened all the splendour of my deeds  
And over all the glory of great wars  
And broken fields of battle cast a pall.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
My knight he is and loyally he serves.  
But let thine eyes and not thy lips demand  
Response: lean forth above the crystal flood  
And with keen search from visioned future pluck  
A present knowledge; in those depths there lie  
The figures, shapes, and fashions of all things.  
Call forth again its magic pageantry,  
And seek thy answer there.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                           The depths are stirred,  
Light leaps from shadow, figures move and sway  
And gather into outline fraught with life. . .  
Unbound he lies, the horse with feet unmoved  
Crops short the herbage, triple caitiff knights  
Have laid their hands beneath him; now they toil  
Across the gorse; his helpless body hangs  
With legs and arms that strike against the ground  
In mimic eagerness and mock embrace.  
And here they move beyond the mirror's rim,  
And lo, myself, approaching on the hill! . . .  
Dark! . . . dark! . . . more quick than sun before the storm,  
Or moon cloud-ridden, sped the light away.  
This water, gleaming with the shapes of men,  
Is now but water --  
  
                   THE SECOND  
                           And therewith fulfils  
Thy thirst, and calls upon thee for thy word,  
That pledged reward, that choice between our lives.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
How ran your saying? "Whoso drinks  
Shall choose among us her whom true desire  
Would make companion in the day of deeds."  
Fair are ye all: here lies no price to pay,  
But some reward, heav'n-sent to quench desire.  
Fair are ye all, and therein lurks the doubt:  
I choose the one, and straight the other two  
Neglected rankle, till a gaping wound  
Across my memory cries out regret,  
And lo, I know not whom my choice approves.  
Yet often, when our brains are still at fault,  
Still measuring confusion, weighing doubts,  
There wakens in our heart a sudden fire  
To guide the will and light the darkened thought.  
I pray you, therefore, be compassionate  
And find no evil in my words; their fault,  
If fault they hold, set not against my charge,  
But lay their burden at the doors of Them  
Who fashioned men and gave them their desires.  
  
                   THE ELDEST  
To him that cries my name, I bring a gift  
Of wisdom greater than the strength of kings.  
Mine eyes have seen, through many a changing year,  
The circles of men's life revolve, return,  
Through birth and childhood unto age and death.  
My lips can tell thee tales and mysteries  
Of olden days when dragons held the earth  
And creatures of the slime were on the sea,  
When men did battle in fierce, brutish wise  
And lived in hollow caverns of the hills.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
The past I love not: 'tis a murdered life,  
A corpse wherein the worms of memory cling.  
I like not tales, they haunt the present deed  
And make the sword-edge tremble with their dreams,  
The faltering spear-shaft snap within our hands.  
  
                   THE YOUNGEST  
But I am one who never felt the past  
Blow like the bitter wind from winter seas.  
For me the world is yet a dream unheard,  
A flower whose cup has never held the sun.  
Turn unto me and love me; thou and I  
Shall guide anew the world, restore the right,  
And make of men a goodlier, nobler race.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
There is nought certain in this world of change  
Save what our hands can grasp, our eyes behold;  
All else is mockery of chance and time,  
A golden bauble, a deceptive lure,  
A sunlit rainbow seen across the clouds, --  
Draw nearer, there is nothing: mist and rain.  
And thou, fair maid upon the threshold caught  
With eager feet half ventured, half afraid,  
Thy promise is not yet fulfillment grown,  
Thine eyes are mirrors of a future world,  
Foreboders of enchantment, giving view  
On womanhood and sweet matured delights,  
Still hidden, now, in virginal reserve.  
                \[ *He turns towards the* SECOND MAIDEN.\]  
But thou whose gaze is neither sad nor gay,  
Not sad for years behind thee taken flight,  
Nor gay with hope of pleasant days unseen,  
But full with knowledge of a present grace,  
Demanding not from future or from past,  
Secure within the fastness of thy ways,  
Thou art to me a token and a sign  
Of perfect womanhood's unyielding charm,  
For matchless adoration set apart.  
I choose thee for the mistress whom my spear  
Shall champion against the warring earth;  
My sword shall bear thy name through cloven steel  
Of foeman's helm and reeling battle-shield;  
And like a beacon shalt thou blaze and burn  
Above the lists, through cries of fallen men,  
To light me into battle, till I grasp,  
With victor's hand, th' unsteady plume of fame.  
  
                   THE SECOND  
The choice is made, the choosing spirit bound;  
The reed is cut, the spoken word is writ;  
Closed lies the book; already, many hands  
Are fashioning the unrelenting seal.  
The hour is here wherein thou shalt depart.  
In form invisible I come to guide  
Thy shifting purpose and uncertain will.  
Go forth and seek fulfillment from thy choice:  
Beyond this wood there lies the waiting world  
And many deeds therein, to do or spurn.  
Across the shifting picture of thy fate  
Lie sun and shadow of incessant change  
And nought of steadfast purpose under all  
Save me, in guise unseen, to lead thy hand  
From fortune into favour, love, and strife.  
Farewell, and fare as best such spirits may  
That choose my counsel; theirs is but a life  
That mocks its own attainment, wrought in vain.  
     \[ *She bends over the well and speaks in incantation.* \]  
  
                Veil the light:  
                Hide the day!  
                Shadow and silence!  
                Dreamless sleep!  
       Spirits hidden in the well,  
       Bound beneath a magic spell,  
       Stirring neither limb nor sense  
       In an idle impotence,  
       Rise against the glaring day,  
                Spreading sable shrouds and dun,  
       Cover earth and sky with grey;  
                Cast your veils against the sun!  
\[ *As she speaks, the light gradually wanes. From the well  
     a fine mist begins to rise.* \]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
By sorcery accursed I stand agape  
Nor stretch a thwarting hand to break the spell.  
Were I a cliff, a thousand ages old,  
Or gnarlèd pine deep-rooted in the rock,  
I could not stand more idly, nor endure  
More helpless in the surging front of ill.  
\[ *The mist grows ever heavier, until a dense fog, rising  
     from the well, has covered the entire stage.* \]  
  
          THE THREE MAIDENS \[ *singing* \]  
     Damp and mist and heavy vapour,  
         Shrouded fog and dripping cold,  
     Quench the sunlight's fallen taper,  
         Hide away the flame of gold.  
     Out of pond and becken cool,  
         Out of well and fountain head,  
     Out of tree-enshadowed pool  
         Where the autumn leaves lie dead,  
     Where no deer with frightened feet  
     Ever leapt in terror fleet,  
         Out of marshy river bed  
     Where no forest creature drank,  
         Out of swamp and fen arisen,  
         Break your bonds and loose your prison,  
     Water vapours, grey and dank!  
  
\[ *The fog has completely hidden everything. The  
     singing voices have drifted ever further and  
     further away, until at last the song dies in the  
     distance. A long silence follows. For several  
     minutes the stage remains grey and void. At  
     last the fog begins to clear.* \]  
  
  
  
                          **ACT ONE**  
  
*SCENE: A wild upland open to the sky. Hill-  
     slopes with scattered firs. The ground is  
     covered with gorse-bushes; knee-high, in golden  
     bloom. The last shreds of fog drift off over the  
     moors to the left and vanish, reevaeling far-away  
     the gleaming towers of the Castle of* ETARRE.  
      *Full morning.* AVRAN, BALARIN, *and* MARIS*  
     stand above the helpless body of* PELLEAS.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Enough of drudge and drag: here let him lie.  
The pricking gorse has played an eager bride  
And clapped him welcome in her unwelcome arms.  
  
                   BALARIN  
A weary work fulfilling punishment!  
Too often in the scourger's thankless toil  
The swinging lash flies back, and with shrewd blow  
Assails th' inflicting hand: so is't with us,  
Who strain against yon living weight of mail  
With bloodless fingers, and with stumbling feet  
Through country-side accurst scarce feel our way;  
Small glory have we got us therewithal.  
This is our fame: to counter with a knight  
Who will not lift his spear against our shields,  
A mad-cap creature in whose brain there sits  
The bird of folly. Truth, a mighty task.  
  
                   AVRAN  
And here, within the growing heat of morn,  
We come like serfs in secret burial,  
Dragging a living corpse beneath the sky.  
Enough, enough! this is no food for knights;  
Our very horses would revolt the taste  
And eye their masters with a keen disdain.  
  
                   MARIS  
There is a feast which no knight may refuse  
If he be bid to a table; all that owe  
Allegiance to an overlord must eat  
The meat of service, drink the willing wine  
Of fealty, whereby true knighthood lives.  
You know from whom you draw your honour's strength;  
She laid upon us bond of her commands  
And bade us from the belly of his steed  
Unbind this knight and over briar and thorn  
Drag out his body till the breath be faint:  
So should his courage vanish like a dream,  
And that mad frequency of his desire  
Be staid to abstinence. Up! drag him on.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Then snare the sun and strangle out its heat.  
Go, draw cool shadows out of distant trees  
And wake the winds that sleep upon the hills.  
Call back our bodies' breath that's taken flight  
At sight of labour, like a bonded wretch.  
  
                   MARIS  
Then let him lie, and heaven rest his soul.  
  
                   BALARIN  
The mighty Pelleas, the rumoured knight  
Well proven in the midmost toil of war,  
How fares he now, the hero of the lance,  
The champion such as men have never seen?  
  
                   AVRAN  
In curious wise beneath the open sun  
He dreams of battle, while the springing gorse  
Grows up unheard around his silent helm.  
  
                   BALARIN  
But when his bruisèd limbs have found the balm  
Of first recovery, he'll rise and seek  
To draw the shattered ships of his emprise  
To greater battles over windier deeps.  
  
                   AVRAN  
'Twere well to slay him here and quench his soul.  
Else will the spirit that indwells his breast  
Grow wings once more and fly above our heads  
Like loosened hawk against the fleeing hare.  
  
                   MARIS  
We may not slay him, tho' 'twere mercy's hand  
Which dealt that stroke.  
  
                   AVRAN  
                       Then will he, like a midge,  
In vast persistence make our lives a curse  
Of tiny wounds and quick annoyances.  
  
                   MARIS  
'Twill prove him small avail to prick and sting:  
The midge, if he return too often, learns  
That wings so small can yet be clipped and crushed  
And tiny body caught and buffeted.  
  
                   AVRAN  
'Twere well to hold it longer to its cage;  
Yet here it has its freedom and the world  
Wherein to fly abroad, and lo, it lies  
Ungrateful, without sign of thanks or praise.  
Fly warrior, we salute thee! Noisy gnat,  
Midge of the marshes, fare thee well!  
  
                   BALARIN  
                                                    All hail,  
Chit-sparrow; sit i' the bush and braggart sing;  
O valiant bird! O wren with eagle's soul!  
An owl that flies in daytime without eyes.  
\[BALARIN *and* AVRAN *depart across the hill.* MARIS  
      *follows, but hesitates and turns back.* \]  
  
     MARIS \[ *standing above the body of* PELLEAS\]  
Too many times, far, far too many times  
In this same outcome of the selfsame deed  
Have we prevailed above you, dragged you off,  
Railed over you and spoken out our curse  
Of bitterness against your foolish ways  
And ears forever thirsting for abuse.  
Too many times our lips have brewed this draught  
And mixed the gall of laughter with farewell,  
A honeyed mead in truth, a stirrup cup  
To speed you in your folly. Change your ways!  
But if you fall once more within our hands,  
Expect no better fare from us, nor yet  
From her that sent us, whom your seeking eyes  
Shall never look upon again.  
                                     \[PELLEAS *moves slightly.* \]  
                   PELLEAS  
                                             Etarre!  
  
                   MARIS  
Yes, 'tis Etarre! the one sweet word forlorn  
That lies upon your lips like magic seal,  
Like stroke of sorcery and mystic spell  
Awak'ning fever in your blood and brain  
That iron may not chill, nor dungeon tame!  
                                         \[ *He goes off. Silence.* \]  
  
                   PELLEAS \[ *moaning* \]  
O world! O disillusion!  
                             \[ *In a sudden passionate outburst* \]  
                                                  Black despair,  
Come, cover me with all the shrouds of night!  
\[ *Silence.* FERGUS, *attendant on* Pelleas, *comes over the hill to
the right.* \]  
  
                   FERGUS  
I marked them how they stood upon this hill  
In final converse of an evil deed,  
Here, here upon these trackless, silent slopes  
Within the yellow reaches of the gorse  
Lies Pelleas on prison-bed of thorns,  
Bound with the glowing fetters of the sun.  
O misery, that in his mind should dwell  
Submission unto knaves, the lowered shaft,  
The sunken sword, the battle void and thin.  
Alas the name that rang in other days!  
The knight whose deeds dwelt ever on the lips  
Of others' praises -- how with single hand  
He smote the robbers of the woods and hills  
With keen destruction -- how within the lists  
His spear was fire, a gathered shaft of light,  
His battle-cry the voices of the storm.  
And now his name is overset with growth  
Of dark abuse and shameful calumny,  
And those that should have reeled and sunk to earth  
In red disaster and dark swoon of sense,  
These, even these, mean varlets, thieves, and rogues,  
Drag Pelleas through upland gorse and way  
And throw him like a carcase for the birds!  
               \[ *He casts about him in the gorse.* \]  
In vain: in vain. Oh, would that eyes were made  
To pierce the barriers which hide their goal,  
Or cleave like lightning in a darkened sky,  
Bringing their own fierce strength wherewith to see.  
Here, somewhere here, he lies in bitterness  
With broken mail and battered helmet thrown,  
A useless tool discarded from the hands  
Of little workers fashioning misdeeds.  
Etarre! Etarre! accursèd beauteous face  
That shines like fire of madness in his eyes  
And makes his courage falter like a flame;  
Etarre! Etarre! from heaven's utmost height  
May God's unfailing anger strike you down  
And burn that body like a blackened tree!  
May you be fire engulfed with water-floods,  
May you be embers smouldered into death,  
May you be ashes blown across the air!  
I hate you! who are poison in my lips;  
Within my mouth your name runs like a curse,  
A thing to rail against with tongue and teeth.  
                        \[ *He comes upon* PELLEAS.\]  
O mighty master -- fallen, fallen, fallen,  
See, I am here, your servant, nigh at hand  
To raise you up, to loose your helm and mail  
And with fresh water lave your sunken eyes  
And wet your thirsty lips and cheeks and hair.  
               \[PELLEAS *moves slightly, groaning.* \]  
Midway between the waking sense he swoons.  
Ah, master, fallen master, turn and speak!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Leave me. Depart. I have no wish for you.  
Go, bring me death to minister my needs.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Death's a false friend, a thief within your tents;  
He'll stab you in your slumber. Cast him out!  
\[FERGUS *has been busy stooping above Pelleas. He  
     busies himself in loosening the armour while he  
     speaks.* \]  
  
                   PELLEAS  
I'll have no other servant: bring me death.  
  
               FERGUS \[ *loosening the helmet* \]  
Death's a grim army laying endless siege  
Against the living fortress of the soul.  
Endure, endure; beat back the pressing foe,  
Lift up again your shield above the walls  
In stern defiance. See, I raise you up.  
  
               PELLEAS \[ *in* FERGUS' *arms* \]  
Leave me, ah, leave me here. My broken strength  
Is fainter than a sunset wind, my mind  
Is dry and empty. -- Do not make me live,  
But leave me, leave me here; Etarre --  
I saw her not, nor heard her voice, nor felt  
Her anger go across me like a rain.  
God knows, such rain were welcome to my lips!  
Her anger is more sweet than other's praise,  
Her voice is like a wind within the grain,  
A moving swell of wave-like melody.  
  
             FERGUS \[ *raising* PELLEAS *to his feet* \]  
Her voice is like the winter moon half seen  
Across the other shoulder, magical -- a curse!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Have you come hither mocking at my grief,  
To cry before me words against Etarre  
And prick my sorrow into festered rage?  
No, leave me, leave me: what avails your heed?  
I may not look upon her eyes again!  
She will not see me, will not grant me speech;  
Her wretched knights perform her word afar,  
And cast me from her. Oh, world, world,  
What cruelty there lies within your breast  
To poison all the milk whereat we suck!  
We are the children of your hate, conceived  
In some dark moment of false passion, born  
In anguish of repentance, things accursed  
For whom you have no mother-love, no care,  
No joy if we be happy, no regret  
If we be clothed in sorrow and in grief.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Each man, if he be strong, can take the world  
Within the grasping hollows of his hand  
And shape anew the image of his will.  
There is no knight of all this country wide  
Can sit his steed unshaken in the lists  
Against your onset, none that can maintain  
A helm unshorn, and armour unassailed.  
What runes are carven by an evil hand  
Within the iron of your spirit? Wake,  
Throw off the clutch of sleep, the grasp of dreams,  
And blow the wraith of magic into mist  
Of idle vapour. Ah, if I were you,  
My lance should smite the laughter of your foes,  
My wrath should strike them like an angry sea,  
My vengeance scatter them like autumn leaves!  
Ride, ride against them! Snap their strength in twain!  
Go like a curse across this evil land  
And leave behind you weeping in the halls  
And wail of women seeking 'mid the slain  
For their departed lords: and she, the shining snake  
That sits enfolded in your changèd heart,  
She, even she, whose castle holds these lands,  
Etarre, the witch of evil, let her die.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
What, is your service changed to blackest gall?  
Is all your heart tormented like your speech  
With envious canker? O ungrateful task  
To lift from earth the children of the dust  
And give the toiling creatures of the plough  
High freedom in a servitude of love.  
Nay, who shall give the oxen of the field  
The battle-steed's high temper, who shall place  
A soul within the body of a slave,  
And waken knighthood stifled in the serf?  
  
                   FERGUS  
With no sweet ointment of forgiving love  
Will I anoint the heads of those that feed  
Their starving wits on hatred and foul thoughts.  
To them that do you wrong I bear one love,  
The love to see their naked bodies hang  
From windy branches, and their vulture necks  
Engirdled with the swaying, clinging noose.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
God grant you never set your feet within  
The holy circle of knighthood! -- Take me hence.  
For I will wait until my body's harm  
Be grown to match my soul's serenity,  
The high security of my resolve.  
Then shall I find me other ways to seek  
My lady's favour, win her angry heart  
To softer mood of loving.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                      Yet your words  
Are greater than your strength. How would you walk  
Through upland gorse and rough unlevelled way?  
I cannot bear you far, tho' I am fain  
My back would seek the burden.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                          Search and say  
If with your eyes you mark my loosened steed  
Among the heather ranging; for they came  
And bore me bound thereto. You see him not?  
Go, search the distance with quick feet and bring  
Him hither straight; he has not wandered far.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Rest here in quiet till I come again  
And wait in patience for my sure return.  
                                                          \[ *He
departs.* \]  
     \[PELLEAS *stands staring before him in silence.* \]  
  
                   PELLEAS  
I would I were as changeless as the sun  
Who sinks each day into the nether-mist  
And on the morrow mounts above the dawn  
In light undimmed; but I with shaken soul  
Survey the darkness, and with faltering step  
Go down into the countries of the night,  
Not knowing if within another East  
My eyes shall look upon the risen day.  
All, all is dark: the hell-pits of despair  
Gape ever at my feet. Where leads the way  
That brings me to the daylight of her eyes,  
The dawn which is her presence, and the world  
Which is her body's grace, her beauty's orb  
Of circled wonder? Barred and double barred!  
There is no oaken shaft can break this port,  
No twisted hook to catch the bolt aside.  
                                           \[ *Silence* .\]  
O sérene sun, alone and pitiless,  
How mocking is the glitter of thy beams!  
Meseems thou art the laughter of the world  
Made visible, contemptuous disdain  
Wherewith all nature frames the race of man.  
O shadow stretched before me on the ground,  
What thing art thou, with what fidelity  
Art thou my steadfast comrade? Is't thy wish  
That binds thee, or a dread necessity?  
Art thou my soul, an unsubstantial thing  
Knit to me while the sun of life shall last?  
The sun's a mockery, and life a lure!  
Go! I release thee from thy servitude;  
Thou canst not love me who am no man's friend.  
Here in the world I stand alone. Go forth,  
My soul, my shadow; seek a happier land  
And leave this wretched body to fulfil  
Unequal combat with a grudging fate  
And so go down to death, all purposeless.  
     \[ *He becomes aware of* GAWAINE *approaching.* \]  
What knight is this that stands upon the hill?  
Is this some foe to plague my restless life,  
Some novel torment wrought against my love?  
He moves alone, an armoured knight, afoot  
Within these reaches of untrodden wild.  
How came he here? Why moves he without steed  
In painful toil beneath his armour's press?  
                                      \[GAWAINE *enters.* \]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Long have I sought you, wayfaring alone.  
In visionary speech with three, I gained  
Strange knowledge and strange biddings to fulfil.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Knight, if on wrathful deed your steps be turned,  
Let not your pride so wander from its ways  
That it o'erstride itself and seek the dark  
Of high self-confidence and vaunting word.  
Fulfil your bidding, add your little stroke  
Of evil action, yet at heart know well  
By no necessity of fallen strength  
I yield my honour to your lesser sword.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
You shall not find the hungry bird of hate  
Upon my shield engraven, with fierce claws  
Tearing the world asunder.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                          Are you not  
Of them that loathe me at my lady's will  
And their own coward hearts' high jealousy?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
I am of Arthur's court. I come in need  
To succour knighthood, as our king enjoins  
Upon the glorious order of his knights.  
I know not who you are nor with what wrong  
Pent up by men's ill-will and jealous hate.  
Yet three there were who spoke in visioned speech  
And by their power on heaven's high elements  
Conveyed my hither.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                      O belovèd sound,  
The speech of knighthood in this wretched land,  
The light of honour risen in the dark  
Of shameless men and unrepentant deeds!  
Pelleas I am: my spear has held the prize  
In many tourneys made in many lands.  
Much have I heard and loved your noble king.  
The name of Arthur is a silver star  
Of truth and equity; in faultless strength  
The sword of chivalry gleams there aloft,  
A vision unto men, a creed for faith.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
And I am Gawaine, of the king's high court,  
Come hither from the walls of Camelot.  
The fame of Pelleas has pierced the dark  
Of distance, with the light of far renown  
For tourney's wreath, and battle's blameless meed.  
Our noble order knows no nobler knight.  
What fateful force of men iniquitous  
Or deed self-willed has brought you, armed and lone,  
To stand upon the broom's flower-gilded heights  
And gaze across the stretch of wind and sun  
On warring wastes where no man's hand is set  
Compulsive o'er the unwilling growth of fields?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Alas, this tale runs back among the years  
And far beyond the present sight attains  
Its first awakening.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                     Yet would I hear.  
I seek adventure and I strive to bring  
Knighthood's redemption into creedless lands.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
On word there is, which shuts and opens wide  
The doors of all my deeds and all my thoughts:  
It is a sign wherewith to clothe my soul  
In courage linked from bright security;  
It is a charmèd ring, a circled rune,  
A treasure-stone of wizardry -- Etarre!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
The name I know not, but am fain to hear  
This mystic potency, enfolded deep  
Within a word's soft-sounding innocence.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
If you would hear, and track the winding speech  
Through courts of men and castles set anigh,  
I have no need to hide on lying lips  
The truth wherefrom my knighthood gets its shame.  
So hearken: -- in the eager days long since,  
I know not how far back, for memory stands  
In helpless failure at the count of time  
So wretched and so slow to drag away,  
Perhaps ten years are flown, enough to fill  
A stripling youth's advance to manly state, --  
Long time, long time, how long ago it seems --  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Nay, well I know the adverse wind of fate  
Clouds all the backward years and hides the sun  
Of memory in a grey forgetfulness;  
The past becomes a lost and distant land  
Where once we moved and shall not move again.  
But for your story. -- Speak, and tell the tale.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Magic of forge and steel and crucible  
Had wrought a sword; by whose hand, no one knew;  
'Twas thought the workers of the hills had steeped  
Their fires in incantation and had made  
This sword to be a gift to mortal child,  
A king's son of the western isles, who died.  
Golden the hilt, alight with ruddy glow;  
Thereon engraved, in token of its gift,  
"The son of Ork. Be strong and hold me fast."  
Now, when the king's son died, his father called  
A mighty tourney in the land and set  
This sword as guerdon to the winning arm.  
And many came and made their name be cried  
Within the tourney, and King Arthur's knights  
Were gathered, ten or twelve, and Kay was there  
(Him whom they call the Seneschal), Sir Tor,  
And many others. So the joust was made.  
Great ladies, queens and nobly born, beheld;  
And one there was whose eyes were like a fire  
Within my heart, and ever as I strove  
Her beauty shone about me like a star,  
And in mine ears I heard a crying voice,  
And felt a throbbing of unmeasured strength  
Which of my body made its minister  
To triumph in the tourney. So I fought,  
And over all prevailed.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                              Then you are grown  
A giant from the strength of lesser men;  
The hard-wrought prowess of each vanquished name  
Like hound that changes master comes to you  
To aid you in the quest for fame, and swell  
The cry of hunting.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                      In my hands they set  
The tourney's meed, the gleaming hilt of gold  
That clasped the flash of steel; upon my head  
The golden circlet clung. And I, forthwith,  
Rode down the lists, and passed with heedless eyes  
The rangèd queens, and at the shining feet  
Of one more fair than kingly daughter cast  
The golden circle, royal crown of love  
And adoration; but with mocking hands  
She flung it from her, high above the heads  
Of those who sat about her, that it fell  
Within the dust and turmoil of the lists.  
And many there cried out with jealous speech  
And wrought her shame, until I made be known  
That I would prove her every act and word  
Against their gathered spears: thereat they ceased.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Strange tale it is, yet not too hard to read.  
She loved a lesser knight and with sure strength  
Spurned proffered homage of his vanquisher.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Nay, in that quiet heart of hers there beats  
No blood of passion. Dark indifference  
With sluggish stream mounts ever in her veins.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What came of this?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                        Into her rightful land  
I followed her; and there I still abide.  
Against the sky of my desires and deeds  
There stands, with distant battlements agleam,  
The castle of Etarre, undimmed, unchanged,  
While over me the seasons spend their wrath  
And men work out their hate; yet I prevail.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
What brought you here alone and without steed?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
The hands of men across the thorny wild.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
In anger, or by your own spoken wish?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
In anger done, yet by another's will.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Why seek to hide the need? Within a glass  
I saw a knight whom other three unbound  
From belly of a steed, and with rude strength  
Dragged far across the barren fields of gold.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Ah, I am shamed forever in your sight.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
True knighthood never sleeps with naked shame,  
And though he share her hovel leaves therein  
No children of ill fame. Your courage shines  
Through all the shrouds of dark ignóminy.  
Pure spirits cannot err.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                           O noble creed,  
That brings the eye to witness, not to judge  
Ask what you will.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                    I ask your present need,  
And give you service of my sword and spear.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Strength will not ease the tightened cord of hate,  
'Tis drawn too high above an earthly reach.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
The sword of courage and the spear of truth  
May yet avail. Who were these wretched three  
And by what order moved?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                            The self-same word:  
It is a light for knowledge.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                            Speak! Etarre?  
And is it she who brings you into wrong?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Because I may not live sans sight of her  
I ride against her knights in mimic fray  
And suffer them to make me prisoner  
That I may come before my lady's eyes  
To look upon her countenance and hear  
The wonder of her speech. In wrath alway  
She cries against me and commands her knights  
To cast me into dungeon or to set  
The brand of shame across my fallen shield  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Were those her men that wrought you this despite?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Her will through others moving, cast me here.  
And now the last sweet flower of hope is dead,  
Trod under by her foot. The autumn grows  
And winter creeps along the leafless cold,  
With mortal fingers plucking branch and twig  
And blowing harsh against the feeble strength  
Which is the life of man and beast and flower.  
My hope is dead; I shall not see it more.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
If hope through snow and chill of winter love  
Has ever blossomed in your heart, and spread  
Its balm of perfume through your wounded soul,  
'Twill reach its flower once more against the sky  
To catch the sunlight in its chaliced cup  
And nurture trustless sorrow into confidence.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
This is the last; beyond this utmost bound  
Nought further lies: love, life, all, all at end!  
She will not suffer me her presence' grace,  
But strikes me from afar with other hands.  
To-day, I saw her not; her worthless knaves  
Fulfilled her final anger, bringing word  
More bitter than their curses and their blows.  
"O fool," they said, "our lady whom we serve  
Bids us to tell you that until she die  
She will not look upon your loathèd form  
Nor hear your wretched pleading." So they spoke,  
And dragged me hither with full jest and jeer.  
Accurst be all the forces in me pent  
That out of shattered nody, darkened brain,  
Build up anew the empery of life,  
The realm with I *must* rule, unwilling king  
Of citizens that hold me prisoner  
Within the palace of my self. Have end,  
O dreadful powers working in the dark;  
Have end, and let me die!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                  Nay, live, and love!  
Or if you may not love, then hate; but live!  
Life is a present moment, a shifting point  
That moves from nothing into nothing; where it is,  
There is the world, the beating pulsing world  
With all its marvel of a felt design.  
Stretch out your hand and snare the fleeting point;  
Then have you all the world within your grasp.  
Live, live, and I will aid you in your quest.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
What can you do? For many a month and year  
I dreamed that love would waken in her breast.  
A fool, I dreamed that mortal will could guide  
Love the immortal, Love the uncompelled, --  
From impious effort gaining due reward,  
Sadness of heart, bruised limbs, and shattered faith.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Is there no gentler word which I may speak?  
May I not plead before her, win her heart  
To softer ways and kindlier moods?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                                     In vain.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
May I not say she has misjudged, has scorned  
That which no queen may purchase with her crown,  
A lover's worship, gift of gifts?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                               In vain.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Then let us find some subtler web to catch  
Her fleeting love and bring it to your lips.  
If she be mortal, she shall yet be yours;  
If pity stir within her, let us make  
A staff of pity; if within her dwell  
A woman's worship of high deeds and thoughts,  
Then let us make high thoughts and deeds our scrip  
To help us in our quest; if fear of death  
Live in her body, death shall be our shoon  
Wherewith to walk; if dreams of love  
E'er stir the curtains of her sleep, then love  
Shall be a cloak and clothe us from the rain.  
Pity, high deeds, and love, and fear of death,  
Shall be to us cloak, shoon, and scrip, and staff,  
And from her we'll get alms.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                    In vain! in vain!  
You would with naked strength and covered wiles  
Beget from hatred tears, from loathing love.  
I tell you, not with open pomp and power  
Love enters in. There is a world unseen  
Wherein our passions live, and come and go  
When no eye marks them. In the world of sense  
Our words and deeds have puissance, and the earth  
Trembles before our coming; blown with pride  
We stretch our sceptres toward that other world  
And lo, the wand whereat earth's kingdoms shook  
Stands idle in our hand, a gilded stem.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
And yet Etarre shall love you; grief and fear  
Are masters of the soul, and work their will.  
Love is their servant; they but clap their hands  
And he appears. Give me your knighthood's trust  
And by my knighthood's faith I swear to you,  
Etarre shall love you.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                        O mistaken creed!  
Is love a hound that walks within the leash?  
Too long, too long in folly I maintained,  
Seeking to win her love. Love comes not thus.  
We know not when nor wherefore, we have seen  
No shadow fall across our steps, nor heard  
His mystic footfall; yet we raise our eyes  
And lo, he stands before us, garbed in white,  
Triumphant, with a light upon his brows.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Nay, call him and he'll come, a willing slave.  
God gave him unto men, that men might be.  
Hearken and heed: your shield and helm and sword  
Shall change with mine. So armed, and with a steed,  
Will I approach the castle where Etarre  
Holds state aloof.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                   What then? She'll love me more  
Because you hold my arms?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                Nay, hate you less.  
Death breaks in twain the stubborn plant of wrath  
And treads to earth its growth and jealous fruit;  
He lays his finger on the lips of hate,  
And anger stands with saddened eyes downcast  
Before his presence. In the camps of war  
He binds proud nations with a chain of tears,  
And with a mound of earth builds emperies.  
Etarre shall hear my words of bitter weal  
And think you dead. Thereat her brow will change  
And all her nature be suffused with grief;  
Th' unshaken headland of her wrath shall sink  
Within a sea of tears. With sudden ray  
Illumined, she shall see life's large expanse  
Move like a landless ocean, vast and void.  
So will her heart be caught with sudden love  
And she shall hate me, and against my name  
Cry murderer. Her body's burning light  
Shall languish in the sable cloth of grief,  
Affliction's gloomy cloak; her cheeck shall pale  
With wan reflection, like the moon that broods  
Too much upon the splendour of the sun.  
Then will I cry her pardon of my fault,  
Confess you living, till the glad blood leap  
Through all her veins and mantle in her brow.  
She shall give thanks to Heaven's holy power  
That held you safe; to all, she shall proclaim  
You loved and dear; and she shall bid me go  
To seek you out and bring you to her arms.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
So, with the breath of falsehood you would blow  
Love, like a wooden vane that points the wind?  
The gust of truth will veer it straight once more!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
The winds must change; the north must yield to south,  
The breath of snow be melted by the spring,  
And hate must falter at undoubting love.  
Give me your shield and sword, and let me fare.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Shall love's high course be furthered by deceit,  
Blessed by false words and hastened by false wiles,  
And crooked path lead straighter to the goal?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Yet paths that cannot scale a naked cliff  
May find soft slopes to guide a sure ascent  
On other sides. What matter for the turn?  
Give me your shield and sword, and let me fare.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
I will not. 'Tis by other ways I seek  
To win her pure truth and faultless love.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Are you a fisher who with straining net  
Enmeshes ocean prey, and at the last  
When silver fishes struggle in his grasp  
Throws back his booty to the waiting sea?  
The years with eyes of pity have looked down  
Upon you, and in restless flight o'erhead  
Paused for a moment with a prophecy  
Of other years to come.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                             And now?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                                     And now  
The time is here with open-handed gift,  
And you would spurn it! Oh, how vain are thoughts!  
They have no more reality than mist  
Which sunlight scatters: 'tis the deed that *is* .  
Three days, and you shall lie within the clasp  
Of golden arms and hear from burning lips  
Love's true confessional, the marriage night.  
Will you then doubt she loves you? Will you smite  
Her mouth and call her lips a liar's tool  
And cast her from you? What shall matter then  
The means whereby we strove and wrought, and gained  
This loved reality, this goal of all your thoughts?  
If she be brought to love you, then she loves,  
And on it there's no doubt.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                  But in my heart  
Doubt raises tumult like an angry sea.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
A stormless sky shall lay its waves at rest.  
Etarre shall love you, by my word and truth!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
O fond belief, that wings the heart  
As feather to a bird new-born  
Wherewith to leave the nest of pain  
And seek the lands of gold!  
Give me your oath of knightly faith  
That you are herald in this act,  
Not wooer.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
            For that jealous word  
I give you pardon.  
\[ *He stretches out his hands and touches* PELLEAS'  
*sword* .\]  
                   Hilt and bar and blade  
Be record of my oath; sunlight and wind  
Maintain it; honour keep it fast. I swear  
By Arthur's knighthood shining in the skies  
Of false enchantment and black cowardice,  
If I be found unfaithful, changeful, false,  
May my bare through feel this unsheathèd blade,  
May I be cast for ever from the light!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Across despair's black-vaulted firmament  
Your words have moved refulgent like a star  
Which angels hurl from heaven to guide men's steps  
On stormy nights through treacherous foul ways.  
Words lie too lightly on the lips of man  
That I with words could thank you.  
                                       \[ *He loosens his helm.* \]  
                                            Take my helm,  
And here my shield.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                   The sword--?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                                I cannot give.  
"Be strong and hold me fast," so runs the rune.  
Through dungeon keep, through false defeat, foul hands,  
And knaves' dark roguery, the rhyme has wrought;  
Unharmed the sword abides. Take shield and helm,  
Therefrom the tale has evidence enough.  
                   \[FERGUS *appears over the hill.* \]  
And here at time's full flood my servant comes,  
Called by the present need, -- and yet, alone;  
Wherein our need is desolate. He went  
To seek a mount, yet comes with empty zeal.  
\[FERGUS *at sight of* GAWAINE *stops, alarmed. Reassured  
      by* GAWAINE'S *attitude and bearing, he advances.* \]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Armed and afoot, I cannot far proceed.  
Yon castle on the deep horizon's rim  
Beckons and nods with greeting from afar  
In vain civility. Stands nowhere nigh  
Some hermitage whence I may find a steed?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
My man-at-arms knows well this waste of land.  
He shall inform us.   \[ *To* FERGUS\] So, in idle quest  
You sought?  
  
                   FERGUS  
               Sir Pelleas, the steed I found.  
He waits beyond the slant of yonder rise.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
What mock of service have you hid herein?  
I bade you lead him hither.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                   How? with wings?  
He cannot mount the sudden sheer ascent;  
But thither I can bear you, where he waits.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Then thither lead Sir Gawaine.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                       Shall he ride  
And you remain?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                  Shall squires-at-arms protest  
When knights hold counsel?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                          Good sir knight, oft time  
The fool's hid wisdom guides the king aright,  
The jester's bells sit steadier than the crown.  
I guard my lord and master from deceit.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
I pray you pardon him, a faithful servant,  
Who errs too much in serving and in faith.  
                                                        \[ *To*
FERGUS\]  
Sir Gawaine goes to plead before Etarre,  
And win me favour.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                    Favour in love's cause  
Is not a ring to slip on other's hand.  
The pleader pleads but for himself.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                               O vile,  
O base earth-born, were you my serving man  
Red stripes should leap across your quivering back;  
The dogs should laugh at you and loll their tongues  
To see you lower fallen than themselves!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Sir Gawaine, pardon. Much adversity,  
On me descended, has made dark his mind.  
He probes forever in suspicious depths,  
And where he thinks to find an enemy,  
His very soul drips poison and his words  
Are but the distillations of his thoughts,  
The gathered fumes and acids of his brain.  
He shall repent and serve you loyally.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Then let me go forthwith and seek the steed,  
And so depart. My helm and shield I leave  
In pledged exchange. When twice the sun has set  
And twice arisen, messenger shall come  
And big you to the castle of Etarre.  
Till then, farewell.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                    God speed the ventured aim.  
  
                   FERGUS  
And you, O master, what of you alone,  
Wearied and hungered on the shadeless hills?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Go seek for me from distant hermitage  
Another steed. By sun-down be returned  
And bear my hence at last.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                    Farewell.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                                   Farewell.  
                  \[FERGUS *and* GAWAINE *depart.* \]  
  
                   PELLEAS  
\[ *alone, watching the two move across the brow of the hill* \]  
So fare, my heart's adventure, so fare well.  
  
                   **CURTAIN**  
  
  
  
  
                    **ACT TWO**  
  
*SCENE: A room in the Castle of* ETARRE.  
        *Tapestries upon the walls. The late afternoon  
       sun streams in through a solitary window. Its  
       shaft of light falls full upon* ETARRE, *who sits  
       before a loom set in a recess. She is working  
       at a tapestry, now nearly finished. A maid,  
       * AILEEN, *attends her.*  
  
                   ETARRE  
And one more colour to enrich his crest.  
Shall it be scarlet?  
  
                   AILEEN  
                    Would not blue lie well?  
  
                   ETARRE  
It shall be scarlet. He shall flash and burn  
Like dew sun-kindled with a thousand sheens.  
Where hangs the scarlet thread?  
  
                   AILEEN  
                                       Here at the wing  
From this last dripping stain.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                       The sun a-mist  
On autumn afternoons so stains the world;  
A noble colour for a crested plume.  
  
                   AILEEN  
Yet blue were softer.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                     You are bitten deep  
With this sea-madness; in your own blue eyes  
Nought's fair that is not blue.  
  
                   AILEEN  
                                       The world's a-drip  
With red and crimson, or you like it not.  
  
                   ETARRE  
But, look you, I have reason in my choice,  
For red's the fairer colour. There is nought so brave  
As scarlet banners or a crimson sky.  
  
                   AILEEN  
For them that like it. But the blue of streams  
On summer afternoons 'neath summer skies  
Gladdens my heart with deep and pure content.  
  
                   ETARRE  
And one lone spray of hooded red in flower  
Cries louder than the murmur of your streams,  
The quiet of your skies. They are fancy-poor  
Who love not red.  
  
                   AILEEN  
                  And false of heart  
Who love not blue.  
                                                \[ *Sings.* \]  
          Love came to me in kirtle red,  
          (Honour's false and Faith is dead);  
          Came again in kirtle blue  
          (Honour's fair and Faith is true).  
  
                   ETARRE  
You're quick in mocking me with children's rhyme.  
Make me a rhyme to mock this rainbow bird  
Whose crest is finished. How he sweeps and flies!  
Come, I'll begin it.  
                                                \[ *Sings* \]  
          On the wind there flies a bird;  
              He is come from distant shores,  
              From the dawn's unopened doors  
          To the western gates unstirred.  
          In his wingèd flight there run  
          Colours of the setting sun.  
                                      Do you end the song.  
  
                   AILEEN \[ *singing* \]  
          Eyes and lips and sweet desires  
              Are but feathers for his wings,  
              Burning love the song he sings;  
          All thy hope and thought are fires  
              Giving light unto his eyes;  
                 Life and youth,  
                 Beauty, truth,  
          Are the strength wherewith he flies.  
          Snowy breast and golden hair  
          Are but plumes for him to wear.  
          He shall sing a summer's day,  
          Clap his wings, away, away.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Ill caught. You've made your bird too like to Time,  
The raven dark who speeds across the world,  
And dressed him in fine colours like a daw  
Which steals strange ornament.  
  
                   AILEEN \[ *singing* \]  
          Silken raiment wherein dressed  
              Beauty shimmers half divine,  
              Glint of jewels, rare and fine,  
          Are but colours for his crest,  
          Crimson colours for his wings;  
          Hark! 'tis love whereof he sings!  
              Brave and gay, a summer's day,  
              Ere he flies away, away.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                       I like it not.  
It troubles me with some half-dreamed lament,  
An unknown broken promise, I know not  
To whom, nor for what purpose, made. Poor bird  
Here woven on the loom, thou are maligned!  
Thou art pure fancy of mine inmost dreams,  
Not touched with these gross images of earth.  
Thy colours are imperishable light  
Caught from the steadfast sun and held secure.  
Thou'lt never fly away, but here remain  
To be mine eye's interpreter of joy,  
To hang upon my castle walls, and sing  
Thy crimson colours in sheer ecstasy.  
  
                   AILEEN  
Ay, let him live in silken thread and woof;  
There is a bird which flies from mortal grasp.  
Most fair he is, to perch upon our wrist  
With flashing colours, and from sunlit throat  
Pour forth his flooding heart's high melodies.  
In every word you speak, he trills and sings;  
In every motion of your hand, he moves  
With wings aflutter; in your brightening eyes  
He lives triumphant: oh, beware, beware;  
Too soon he's gone, and in the dusk and chill  
No nightingale shall waken into song.  
  
                   ETARRE  
What mean you? Life and Youth and Happiness?  
I have them in sweet surfeit.  
  
                   AILEEN  
                                  And of love?  
  
                   ETARRE  
How many times did I forbid his name  
And cast him from my highest battlement?  
With subtle track you turn upon my words  
And lead me toward that monstrous loathing, hid  
In all your thoughts. Shall I not be content  
With golden solitude, that I must bind  
Love's naked body to my car of dreams?  
  
                   AILEEN  
A maiden's eyes, a maiden's wise,  
The open gates of paradise.  
  
                   ETARRE  
What mask of rhyme holds revel in your brain  
That you make mock of me?  
  
                   AILEEN  
A loveless fate, and Eden's gate  
Is barred with double sword of hate.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                             Have done! have done!  
  
                   AILEEN  
Flame that burns not, stream that flows not,  
Maid that loves not, Eden knows not.  
  
                   ETARRE  
This is an old wives' song, a ragged cloth  
With halting stitches sewn in knotted thread,  
And you would clothe me with it like a queen!  
I am content with life; you'd stir the stream  
To waters turbid as the floods in spring.  
  
                   AILEEN  
I pray for love's awakening, to end  
This dream that hides its own poor solitude  
In deep illusion of a soulless life.  
My heart can do no more.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                              Not more, yet less,  
And cease to weary me with hopes and tears.  
Your tongue moves ever in the wells of speech  
Drawing new wonders to the light of day;  
And chief there-mid ther curling snake of love  
Winds envious through all your words. Have done.  
                                            \[MARIS *enters.* \]  
                   AILEEN  
And here comes one to guide you in your ways,  
To steep your heart in cold indifference,  
And marble every living pulse and vein.  
  
                   MARIS  
I pray you, give me a moment's grace, to cross  
Your silken fancy with rough thread of care.  
I have been troubled with much thought of late;  
Our silent halls have heard my pacing step  
And stared in dark displeasure, matching frown  
Of sullen stone to sullen brow of thought.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Has Care thrown nets within my castle-yard  
Or brought us siege? We'll catch him prisoner  
And show him forth. Speak on, lay bare his haunt;  
Pull down his hiding place and hale him out.  
  
                   MARIS  
Your eyes have seen him, many a day that's past.  
He will not be gainsayed, but comes again  
With unstilled clamour to our quiet walls.  
He carries armour like a knight, has shield,  
A spear, a sword, yet will no battle bear;  
We drag him out and cast him to the wilds,  
Where nature tends him with her healing dew  
And dries him with the sunshine and the wind.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Pelleas.  
  
                   MARIS  
            The orbed and golden fire of day  
With no more steadfast pace in heaven's track  
Returns to us: yet one gives light and warmth,  
The other is a flame within our fields  
That must be quenched.  
  
                   AILEEN  
              Flame quenches flame, but sword  
Can cut it not.  
  
                   MARIS  
               Here's parable enough  
To quench the very sun in ignorance  
And cloud the light of reason in our brains.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Her idle speech yields up its idle tale:  
To all her riddles waits a single key,  
A key which I have dropped in blackest moat.  
  
                   MARIS  
You've carved a rune to clear a parable.  
Your words are like a flight of wingèd birds  
Crossing from sea to sea above my head;  
I watch them pass, yet know not where they go.  
But as for Pelleas, we'll speak of him;  
He has a malady which eats his life  
Like rain upon a sword-blade, turning steel  
From flash and splendour into edgeless rust;  
Deeper and deeper sinks the water-drop  
Till all's corroded and the biting teeth  
Of slow destruction meet from either side.  
And such a sword is worthless unto men,  
Fit for quick burial. In short word and brief,  
For Pelleas I come, to counsel death.  
  
                   ETARRE  
You'd have me slay him!  
  
                   AILEEN  
                             Overstepped indeed!  
He runs with too great fury.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                Shall my name  
Be joined with murder's most ignoble rout  
And brought to silence?  
  
                   MARIS  
                       Not in cruelty  
I come. There are some souls so weighed with life,  
So deep in sorrow, so oppressed with ill,  
That death comes like a prison-keeper kind  
To strike away the chains of their captivity.  
The holy Church's covenant of hell and heaven  
Is but a prophecy of that unmeasured dark  
Wherein the dead find sustenance and life;  
And men in their last hour come down unto the strand  
With all earth's hills behind them, and the level sea  
Ready for new emprise unknown and unexplored.  
Death is the hand that sends them from the shore,  
And death the wind that swells within their sails.  
And unto them that walk with leaden eyes  
Viewless and vacant as the staring blind  
Through life's harsh country, weary and despaired,  
To them, you call it cruelty and hate  
To give them vision of th' eternal sea  
Which leads into th' unknown? Oh, be assured  
That Mercy, queen of heaven, with backward grasp  
Beneath her grey-starred gown holds fast a sword,  
And unto some poor souls, in gift of gifts,  
Brings not fine balsam, but the edge of death.  
  
                   ETARRE  
What charge is this; am I then merciful?  
Did mercy move me through the days and weeks  
Of his imprisonment, when he was cast  
To sleep among the nettled dungeon-holds  
And pray for sunbeams in a lightless pit?  
Did mercy move me when with jest and jeer  
You dragged him in the dust of horses' hoofs  
Or cast him in the sight of beast and bird  
To be their mockery? Freedom I sought.  
Slaves can be cruel, and I was worse than slave,  
Tormented with the thought that I was strong  
And he was weak, yet he with all his cries  
Made day a nightmare, and within my breast  
Dried up the wells of pity. Idle hope  
That I should turn against myself, and walk  
On paths of mercy!  
  
                   MARIS  
                     Slay him and be free.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Slay him, and hear the owl at nightfall cry,  
And watch the rooks, wind-blown above the towers,  
Circle and caw, while all with self-same voice  
Say "Murderer?" Slay him, and think the dew  
Is born of lamentation, and the wind  
Is come on wings funereal and wild  
To scream for vengeance from the fiends of hell?  
Slay him, you say, and watch the lips of men  
Curdle against me, till my frenzied hands  
Are clapped above mine ears to hide the sound  
Of spoken evil? O unhappy, I,  
Laden with unpremeditated wrong  
Which will not alter. Oh, unhappy grief!  
  
                   AILEEN  
How changed is your contentment, torn aside  
To bare the inner sorrow of unrest.  
Oh, leave these false pursuings; be at ease  
With woven pictures and imagined scenes  
And make not real the dreams of tragedy.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Dreams, dreams, false shadows, phantoms thoughts,  
How I am wearied of their flapping wings  
Across the twilight of imagined worlds!  
There is a change within me of new hours  
And other suns; I could be kind or cruel  
With unsuspected tenderness and hate.  
There's something born within me, great and strange,  
A child of impulse, wakened in my veins.  
I'll have no more of dreams; come take this loom  
And set it forth to other hands. And now  
We'll hearken, Maris, to your deathly plaint.  
  
                   AILEEN  
I wish you were not wrought of changeful mood.  
But late, you spoke of solitude's content  
And wove yourself a golden web of dreams,  
And now you're torn it like a tangled fly  
Within a spider's mesh that's spun too weak.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Too weak it was; I've torn it with a word.  
  
                   AILEEN  
And with a word rebuilt it many a time.  
  
                   ETARRE  
The spider's dead; he'll weave no more. And now  
We'll listen, Maris, to your plea of hate.  
  
                   MARIS  
'Tis not in hate I urge it. Well you know  
I bear no hate to mightier knights than I.  
  
                   ETARRE  
And well you know I loathe your Pelleas  
And turn all praise of him to darker speech.  
  
                   MARIS  
Still darker speech has gone abroad, to stain  
The honour of Etarre and all her knights.  
There is a tale now told in other halls,  
And false it rings, and yet, alas, is true.  
It tells of one lone knight who puts to scorn  
Dungeon and steel, a foe who will not fight  
Yet always conquers. Men speak hard of you  
And call you vampire, sucking might and power  
From lovelorn men. If this continues on,  
Before the year's end Camelot will hear,  
For Arthur's knights ride fast through all this land.  
If you would keep untarnished light of fame,  
This Pelleas must vanish from the land,  
And mouths of men gape empty of ill words.  
  
                   ETARRE  
And if they know I slew him?  
  
                   MARIS  
                                    Not by guile;  
By open battle in the sight of men.  
  
                   ETARRE  
And who is there in all this land of mine  
To battle with Sir Pelleas?  
  
                   MARIS  
                                Even I.  
For he is fallen from his ancient strength  
Till I and he are grown one force in arms.  
  
                   ETARRE  
And if he slay you?  
  
                   MARIS  
                   Then my cause is lost;  
I bear the sorrow.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                If he will not fight?  
  
                   MARIS  
We'll give him open choice to fight or die  
And love of you will guide him in his choice.  
  
                   ETARRE  
And then he'd slay you! I have seen his spear  
Go down the lists and ravish charging steeds  
Of their proud burden. I have seen his sword  
Shear crest and helm, and leap through buckled steel.  
He'd slay you, slay you, and with eager cry  
Come throw himself before me, plead for love.  
No; other ways there are wherein men die,  
And I, the vampire of the strength of men,  
Shall know a better counsel.  
                                   \[ *A horn is heard.* \]  
                                 Hark, a horn!  
Go bring me news. Return with every speed.  
                                    \[MARIS *goes out.* \]  
Look from the window; is there aught to see?  
  
                   AILEEN  
The sinking light of day on field and moor,  
A flight of birds, the moving heads of grain,  
The leaves ashiver on the trees; nought else.  
  
                   ETARRE  
What meant that horn? Is Pelleas returned  
And have my knights brought me but empty words,  
Boasting completion of the unfulfilled?  
  
                   AILEEN  
It cannot be. Some other danger calls;  
For Pelleas is cast upon the hills  
And comes not riding with imperious haste  
Of new adventure.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                 Year and threefold year  
Unvisited of danger, I have held  
Communion with the change of day and night;  
Wrapped in the quiet of a warless land  
I have forgotten ravaging and death,  
As one who inland dwelling on the hills  
Forgets the loud-tongued clamour of the sea  
And thinks to measure fierceness of all storms  
By that weak wind that plays upon the moor,  
Forgetting all the wrack and thund'rous surge  
Which sweeps to ruin: on a sudden day  
He comes unto the cliffs and hears the sea,  
The menace of the waters holding guard  
Before the portals of the earth. So I.  
And here is war with brazen throat and strong  
Come crying at my door, and I have slept.  
  
                   AILEEN  
Here is no tramping of the hoofs of war;  
Some messenger on peaceful journey bent  
Craves food and shelter, giving in return  
The last hot news of joust at Camelot  
And feast of Arthur's knights, the noble tales  
Of battle unto giant and to dwarf  
In magic wood and isle snake-habited;  
Fen-dwelling sorcerers and craggy fiends;  
The last sad word of knights no more returned;  
Court-news and scandal, like a spider's thread  
That waves in th' wind, seeking whereon to build.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Whate'er it be, my warders stand at guard  
In quick restraint lest any enter in,  
And unexpected come, and unannounced.  
Where's Maris that he waits so long?  
\[GAWAINE *enters, with helm and shield of* PELLEAS.  
      *The visor is down.* \]  
                                       Who's here?  
Pelleas? Quick, help me! call for Maris! help!  
Help, Balarin and Avran, Erse, and Dane!  
Is no one here to help me, none to come?  
O treachery outdark'ning all belief!  
What! none, not one, -- one man to bring me help?  
  
                   AILEEN  
He dare not so assail you! If he come,  
I'll cast myself against him, break his path,  
And hamper him till you be fled.  
\[GAWAINE *stands unmoved, leaning upon his shield.* \]  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                       What! still?  
No motion, no advance to pluck me hence?  
You're harrier and I the song-bird caught,  
And you leave sheathed your claws? What, great of heart,  
You dare so come, and offer me, not death, --  
No! that's too little for your hungry soul! --  
But kindness and a sword that holds its sheath?  
You dare so stand before me, raise no hand  
To bring me hurt? You dare humility?  
O impudence that mocks my woman's strength  
And spurns all vengeance, every stroke of sword!  
You've slain my knights or caught them with some trick,  
You've made me here defenceless to your might,  
And now you stand before me dumb and still  
And speak no word and raise no awful hand.  
  
                   AILEEN  
Shall I bring aid, go search the battlements,  
Call every serf from labour, strip the fields?  
He will not dare assail you.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                 Here abide.  
I need not man's assistance; woman's will  
And woman's word borrow an unknown strength  
When wrong's at issue. Here, in last defence,  
You stand on trial, plead a mortal cause  
Before an unrelenting judge. Have care  
Of every moving word and springing phrase  
Lest they o'ertip the balance with false weight.  
Much have I found of blame and heavy fault:  
A restless spirit walking in the night,  
His mantle blown by gust of unseen winds  
Across the darkness toward the home of storms  
Where stars and sun are hidden; so he moves,  
Wild-eyed with some new vision drawn aghast;  
And this is he who makes my life a curse,  
Pelleas, the knight; for him make your defence!  
What! not an outburst of an injured love?  
Are not those furnaces of passion stirred  
That shone so ruddy in the dark of hate,  
That burned upon the hill-tops of abuse  
Like beacon fires, those furnaces of love  
That once consumed your soul to ashen drift  
And made you like a coal that's burnt to th' end?  
What! not a word? no, not a single word?  
Is all your life's endeavour stricken dumb?  
Then hark; for them that will not plead their cause  
Judgement is given. You have sinned too much  
To keep the water's surface; lead, and more than lead,  
Drags at your body, and the stream's quick flood  
Closes above you, who are judged and damned.  
A thousand ways you've found in your offence:  
Your shadow has been dark on all my paths,  
A fiery shadow burning grass and herb.  
You've eaten out the petals of my life  
And strewn my happiness like withered leaves  
On autumn walks; you've been the wind and rain  
To hold me prisoner beneath my roof  
Longing in vain for sunlight and clear skies.  
You've sinned too much against me, you have moved  
A hundred feet beneath my castle walls  
And with huge shoulders shaken keep and tower;  
You've caught the lightning on the barren wild  
And driven it against me like a hound;  
For like the stroke of earthquake underground  
Or bolt of errant flame across the night,  
So have you shaken me and burned my sight,  
So have you cast my life in monstrous ruin  
And blackened all the walls of strength and love.  
For this you have no penitence, no grief,  
But are returned like hawk upon his flight  
To seek anew the victim you have struck;  
But I am changed to poison-throated snake  
With deadly venom poised upon my tongue  
And all my body tense in gathered coil;  
No harmless serpent of the fens am I,  
But an undreamed and deadly throat of pain;  
I call you to that sombre house of rest  
Wherein all men must while eternally.  
I have been bitter; drunken deep in words  
I have assailed you; now I speak no more.  
Prepare you for your death. I seek my knights.  
\[GAWAINE *raises the bar of his helmet.* ETARRE *starts aghast.* \]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
There is no need. I am not Pelleas.  
  
                   ETARRE  
What knight are you? Oh, speak, how came you here?  
What dark intent of silence led you in?  
What will you of me? Are you rapine's hand  
Or stroke of vengeance, war's untimely sword,  
Some miracle of quick disaster sprung  
From seed unplanted? Speak!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                   Gawaine am I,  
Knight of King Arthur's Court, of royal kith.  
Deception's mask no guiltier purpose hides  
Than from your love and anger to extort  
A knowledge in each mood of praise of blame  
And learn if I win favour for my deed.  
  
                   ETARRE  
What deed? You've slain my knights?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
            They are unharmed.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Are they not stricken and not captive bound?  
Do men-at-arms still hold their watch and guard?  
How came you here? Were all my servants false?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Smooth words and promise of high recompense,  
An oath of loyalty unto your cause,  
A servitor of yours that knew my face  
In other days and other lands -- no more;  
These were enough to gain my entrance here.  
Your servants sought to serve you as they could,  
Thinking to win new favour through my aid.  
Deal not too harshly with them, but on me  
Turn all the passion of your fit rebuke.  
  
                   ETARRE  
I have no heart to child a noble knight  
Well known in Caerleon's court. But answer me,  
This shield so quartered, see, I know it well,  
Yon helm with the green plume half caught aside,  
These are of Pelleas.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                       From him I took them.  
  
                   ETARRE  
You've slain him or made him prisoner?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Not made him prisoner.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                               Then slain?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                       Yea, slain.  
In battle smitten to the final breath.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Dead, Pelleas! Now let the hooded sun  
Break forth in splendour, let the golden moors  
Proclaim thanksgiving from a thousand flowers!  
Oh, I am as the earth, with winter bowed,  
Who sudden feels the weight of snow and frost  
With one great stroke from his twain shoulders cast,  
And leaps unto his feet, and calls for Spring.  
For I had taken resolution dread,  
And death was all about me, lithe and dark,  
To haunt my footsteps and in silent halls  
Afflict my purpose with the nightmare forms  
Which Horror views with shuddering lidless eyes  
Or with fixed stare pursues. Join exultation  
And be aroused to song, my silent heart;  
We are of much relieved, our troubled days  
That were as night's dark pall of mist and cloud,  
Are turned to smoke upcurling in the sun,  
And vanish in the clear expanse of light.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Have you no pity, are you carved of stone?  
This is unholy so to cry and sing,  
To whet rejoicing on the steel of death.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Is it unholy for the wanderer  
Through night's black pitfalls and most secret lures  
To hail the sunrise with a joyful song,  
Knowing he walks securely on his way?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
I could not slay a man with such a wild heart!  
  
                   ETARRE  
It is not I who slew him! Oh, be glad.  
Look you, I am most merciful and kind;  
You know not all my history of grief,  
You know not how he came across my life,  
Black thread within the weaving of my joys!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Noble he was, and glorious in strength.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Whereof I had much cause of bitterness.  
We thrust the dwarf aside, spurn him the path;  
The giant brings us terror in our knees.  
Oh, had he not so noble been, so strong,  
So burning on the lips of man and maid,  
So high redoubted in all mighty arms,  
I would have pitied him, not hated to the last.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Have you no sorrow now, that he is dead;  
Have you no word of praise?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                   Oh, ask me not;  
But unto you who brought me into peace,  
All gratefulness of heart, all kindly words.  
Be welcome to our halls, and bide with us.  
  
                   AILEEN  
Shall I prepare a chamber for our guest?  
  
                   ETARRE  
With every speed. Let Avran know of this.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
I cannot here abide. My journey calls.  
I was on idle mission sent and vain.  
I must go hence again in haste.  
         \[AILEEN, *at a sign from* ETARRE, *goes out.* \]  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                      Oh, stay!  
It is unkindness to defeat all thanks  
And set true praise at loss; you render base  
Her whom your kindness most has cherishèd,  
Most nurtured into grateful ways. You spurn  
The springing blade of recompense, and flee  
Before its growth has quickened into leaf.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
A truer deed, that is not done for gain.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Those purposes were never truly sown  
Which no man bides to reap; but like the wind  
You've scattered bounty with a careless strength  
And run abroad intent on other joys.  
The harvest threshers mock with plundered chaff  
The wind that sowed and knew not how to reap;  
Be more advised and with more human grace  
Glean recompense and store the golden grain.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
With how persuasive touch you lull asleep  
The serpent-heads of honour. 'Tis too late,  
For they have set their fangs within me deep,  
And I must go.  
  
                   ETARRE  
              For honour? Is it honour  
To trample welcome underfoot, and turn  
With angry frown from greeting to farewell?  
Does honour quarrel with hospitality  
And virtue with all kindness?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                 Ask my Wish  
And learn it does not with my Will accord;  
Prove Inclination, and 'twill here abide,  
But speak to Duty, Knighthood, Self-resolve,  
And they will cry "To horse!" and ride away.  
  
                   ETARRE  
It is Ill-will that plucks you by the sleeve,  
A servant in high banquet come to call  
His master forth on other needs?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                        Ah, no;  
For admiration pours me heavy wine  
Of looks and words persuasive to the sense.  
I pray your pardon if I seem unkind:  
There is a vow which bids me hence.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                                         A vow?  
Of fasting and of shelterless advance  
Through rainy ways and dripping nights a-cold?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
A vow most recent to impatient lips,  
To further love's advantage.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                Then remain;  
Tell me the tale and I with woman's heart  
Can find a surer way than quickest wit  
Of man's device. Thus shall you hold the vow  
And further love's advantage.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                    'Twere in vain;  
For she is hard of heart and loves him not.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Is he of manner lovable and kind,  
In birth accepted and on courtly ways?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
All these he is, noble and great and true.  
Knighthood he honours, and the halls of men  
Which feel his stately presence. Such an one  
Is like a crown upon the head of kings,  
Adorning them with beauty. He is strong  
As mountain elm or heaven-cresting pine,  
Yet in his deeds more gentle than a child  
And in his thought as pure.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                               'Tis you that love.  
Could she with such enamoured eyes behold,  
The earth would shrink to nothing at her feet  
And he would stand alone against the stars,  
A hero, crowned with passion, as with light.  
In other guise she knows him, be assured,  
And finds some deadly fault whose clinging tooth  
Tears at his virtues and with venomed drop  
Discolours those fair tints wherein he shines.  
Can you not say with what quick wrong estranged  
She holds him from her?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                         By a wilful mood,  
A child's unreasoned passion of dislike.  
  
                   ETARRE  
There is an eye more deep than reason set.  
False-shadowed forms deceive the fleshly sight,  
False words with reason dally, lead astray  
The wisest thought; but this is undeceived.  
Have you not marked how the untutored wild  
With thoughtless vision of pure sense discern  
Their friends or enemies in humankind?  
And so with woman when she loves or hates.  
Ask why the leaf unfolds to April rain  
But lies close-hidden from the winds of March.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Did I not say, "In vain"? My mind forbode  
A fruitless mission. Therefore, let me go.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Is this a snare of wisdom curling round  
Into unreason? You go forth in vain:  
"Therefore," you say, "make haste!" Nay, therefore bide;  
If you are so persuaded, that your words  
Can never waken love in this Unknown,  
This obdurate and loveless Beautiful  
Who spurns this knight of yours and will not heed,  
Then bide with me, and feast with me, and dream  
Of more successful loves, more gracious toils,  
More sweet acceptance. You are welcome here,  
For you have freed me from a deep distress  
Which boded worse disaster, drawing on  
With monstrous shapes and dreams of murdered men:  
For with my own weak hands and woman's strength,  
Goaded by anger, driven by despair  
I should have bartered Pelleas with death,  
And sold him to the fearful hands of night  
To be their captive, gaining in return  
From that grim changers'-table quick release  
And freedom from the bonds of hate.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                       In vain!  
Did I not say, "In vain"? -- This murdered knight,  
This Pelleas, was noble-souled and great  
And women loved him.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                         Like a strangling noose  
He clung about my heart; through pulse and vein  
A clogging hatred thickened, and my mouth  
Grew dry with anger and unbidden rage.  
But tell me why you slew him; not in hate,  
For praise you speak; and not in rivalry,  
For great you name him.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                         'Twas a slanderous tale  
Against your beauty and your name. To him  
I told it; and in sudden fire he shone  
And with his sword and spear proclaimed you true.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Who bade him praise me? let my word and deed  
Be their own champion, dress their shields alone  
And ride to battle! Was my hate in vain  
That he should hound me with remorseless love?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
For you he died.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                  And I shall bury him  
And on his mound set an ungraven stone,  
That I may cast him alway from my mind  
As life has cast him from her herald's scroll.  
But you who from the one have purged his name  
Shall never from the other be effaced.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
I pray you let me now depart in peace.  
  
                   ETARRE  
By all the sacred bonds of gratitude  
I fetter you and hold you now in thrall.  
By courtesy of knighthood, by the grace  
Of man to feebler woman, by the strength  
Of that great company of Arthur's knights,  
By creed of chivalry and law of faith  
I conjure you, remain!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                         Accursed vow,  
What evil have you brought me! Will you come  
And cry fulfilment of your darkest word?  
For I must bide and to the utmost proof  
Display that broken embassy of love  
Whose hopes are all in vain!  
  
                   ETARRE  
                               Like stricken priest  
Who sees temptation writ on every wall,  
Wide-eyed for sustenance you murmur prayer.  
Am I a creature wrought in deadly shape  
Of mortal passion, that with quivering fear  
You dare not here abide and with me feast  
Holding high converse of adventured deed?  
You do offend me with ungracious thoughts  
And with unworthy shaft suspicion point.  
Yet shall you be forgiven with full heart  
If you from stern intention draw aside  
And turn to kindness. For three nights and days  
Let helm and breastplate join with greave and spur  
Unstirred in idleness.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                       With eager hands  
I lay aside the heavy press of mail.  
  
                   ETARRE  
My knights shall swift disarm you. Here remain;  
My servants shall attend you.  
                         \[ *She leaves the room* .\]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                Fatal vow,  
For thee I am assailed. How hard of heart,  
How cold to pity is that glorious form,  
That haunting presence! Yet, what body's grace  
Here shone about me! with what subtle charm  
Of pleading voice and of unveiled desire  
She bade me welcome! Nay, not ice and stone  
That lovely breast, though it be white as snow  
And like unsullied marble carven out.  
O honour, bide with me, unshaken, strong;  
O knighthood, watch above me. Deep events  
Have wrought me danger. O thrice wretched vow  
That makes my path a journey through the dark  
And spreads disaster wide on every hand!  
  
                    **CURTAIN**  
  
  
  
                    **ACT THREE**  
  
*SCENE: Three richly bedecked pavilions, the  
       central one in the foreground, the others set  
       further back. Draperies and silk hangings.  
       The curtain of the central pavilion is drawn  
       aside to reveal the decorated interior. Within,  
       and near the entrance, are seated* GAWAINE *and  
       * ETARRE *. To the left, through the branching trees  
       and above their summits, the walls of the Castle  
       of* ETARRE *are dimly visible. Toward the  
       right, a gentle slope descends to a thicket which  
       shuts off the view. The last colours of sunset  
       are in the sky.*  
  
                   ETARRE  
Now sinks the day beneath the western rim.  
Night's hooded shepherd gathers-in the light  
And drives the crimson and the purple hues  
From highest heav'n unto their twilight fold;  
There shall they sleep till morn upwakes anew  
And sends them forth on eastern pasturage.  
O golden cloud, farewell; and yonder, too,  
Which like a billowed sea upon the West  
Heaves ruddy flame. Farewell, sweet colours all;  
That night makes shut the heavy doors of sleep  
And seals the portals with a silver star.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Dim silence flings its misty veil abroad.  
Hark! how the birds are stilled, and one by one  
Drop off to slumber.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                     Soon the hornèd bat,  
Shy lover of the twilight, soft of flight,  
With ribbèd wings in noiseless here-and-there  
Will weave the darkness; and the searching owl  
Will be a shadow-phantom clothed with sight.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Gone is the day, and now another sun,  
Another taper in th' eternal halls,  
Is quenched for ever.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                    So the breath of night  
Moves down the long expanse of kindled flames  
And one by one makes dark the future days,  
Until the last weak taper is blown out  
And night unending rules the sunless world.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Let not the sadness of departed day  
Weigh present joy with far fore-boded grief.  
Night robs us not of vision, though her hands  
Pluck down the light from heav'n and bind our eyes.  
Night clothes herself in beauty like a queen  
And robes her naked body with soft folds  
Whose half-concealment makes more rapturous  
The deep allurement of her charms. The day  
Is but a meadow garlanded with flowers;  
The darkness is a forest, deep and far,  
Where wonders move in every rustling leaf,  
And every footfall of the wind foretells  
Some mystic presence. In the noonday sun  
We see too well, and thence see not at all;  
But in the night our very spirit wakes,  
And with more gleaming power than day-lit eyes  
Reads deep the world's enchanted rune. 'Tis Night  
Who unto our most sacred thought and word  
In birth brings for the beauty of the soul.  
  
                   ETARRE  
With quiet hands she lights her waiting stars  
And sends them forth to wander in the skies.  
O Night, sweet mother of eternal calm,  
I owe thee penance. Thy bright brother, Day,  
Has lured me with his colours.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                            See, the East  
Is spreading silver cloth of woven light.  
  
                   ETARRE  
The little people of the hills and meads  
Now hold their gathering at full of moon,  
With grave debate enacting law and will  
Whereby to rule. In angry conclave set,  
They gird their resolution unto war,  
Till beast and bird are stricken by their wrath  
And cry full penitence.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                        This is a tale;  
Yet in this land are wonders strange enow  
Which I myself have witnessed.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                       There be three  
Who hold this land in power, and with strange skill  
Ordain the deeds of men. They oft appear  
To travellers intent on distant ways  
And by gift of favour bind their will.  
These three have you encountered?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                       Even they.  
What shall their craft portend?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                    Nor good nor ill.  
My knights in journey unto other courts,  
My men from field returning at the dusk  
Have met these three and for some trifling grace,  
A draught of water or a sprig of thorn,  
Been bound to choice, but having mid the three  
To one assented are unharmed released.  
                                    \[ *The moon rises.* \]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Whence are they, and with what malign intent  
Draw toll from men?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                 This no man knows or deems.  
They are of mist and water, and their ways  
Are as the air phantastic or the clouds  
Which change their shape to every wilful mood.  
But this adventure comes from many lips  
And I would hear some deed of sword and spear  
Wrough by your hand alone, and from your lips  
Alone recounted. Were you not of they  
Who sought the Grail through lands beyond the sea  
And wrought adventure such as none had dreamed?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
A future quest, forever unfulfilled;  
A lure across the rainbow to the sun!  
'Tis present always and yet never here.  
May I not be of them who make this life  
A great To-be, a vision and a dream.  
Has earth no riches, that we ride aquest  
To find the silver path beyond the moon?  
Are there no flowers save those which other walls  
Enclose for ever from us, and no streams  
Save those beyond the trackless rocks, no sun  
In our own heav'n and no portentous start  
Save those which others see? O wretched souls  
That spurn the wine of life, and drain the cup  
Into the basin which is never filled,  
Where all the lees of mad desire run down, --  
The Unattainable, the great In Vain!  
It is enough for me that here to-night  
I feel the soft sweet air and view the stars  
And hear your voice beside me. 'Tis enough  
That love is beautiful, that life is great,  
That old age is not come, nor winter bleak.  
  
                   ETARRE  
The year looks backward with half-wistful face  
This autumn night; the air is soft with spring  
And lulls the sense to a sweet repose.  
So is it on the first warm eve of May  
When earth, expectant of an unseen grace,  
Awaits it knows not what, all awed and still,  
And thinks to hear across the sleeping hills  
The footsteps of divinity returned.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
And not in vain; for God, each Spring, descends  
In guise unseen to shape the world anew  
To plant desire in every fleshly form  
And resurrect the world from winter sleep.  
Meseems, to-night He is returned to earth  
And with soft wand of vernal sorcery  
Brought back the Spring, and in our sleeping souls  
Awakened voices singing through the dark  
Like birds beneath the stars, to fill the night  
With rapt enchantment.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                 Mystical delight!  
Awake, awake, O sleeping birds of song!  
AWake within my heart, O silent birds,  
And fill the night with music till the stars  
Tremble in adoration! Have I lived and breathed  
These many years, these sombre silent years,  
Or was I numbered with the dreamless dead,  
Encharnelled in a palace, deep entombed  
In empty vault of daily thought and deed?  
Like them that walk within a sleep wide-eyed  
And deem themselves awake, so have I lived, --  
Nay, so been dead, and deemd myself alive.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Do you not feel a pulse of eager blood  
Through every vein, striving with beat and throb  
To rouse the broken armies of the spring,  
And hear the stamping of the hoofs, the cries  
Of mounted knights to battle riding down?  
They are reclaiming to their empery  
The autumn year, and winter's pagan horde  
Falls back before them.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                         Not in earth and air  
Alone they conquer, but in human mind  
They set their banners and in human heart  
Stir high their beacons.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                       Yea, in thine and mine,  
Held captive to them here beneath the stars.  
  
                   ETARRE  
The flames leap heavenward with growing beam  
Of kindled passion. O mad heart, wild heart,  
Why do you beat so fast, why leap and strive  
Like a wild thing netted, caught within a snare  
That leaves it free to struggle? O sweet heart,  
Be still, be still!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                 O sweeter lips, speak on;  
Or better, speak no more; but unto mine  
Make harmony of silence and desire.  
                                       \[ *They kiss.* \]  
\[ *From the pavilions in the background is heard a voice singing.* \]  
  
                   SONG  
   When bleak December bares the hills  
     And snowflakes curl in air,  
   When hoary January chills  
     Young hearts with old despair,  
   When February plucks the day  
     And plumes the stormy night,  
   When March winds prowl in quest of prey  
     And battle with the light,  
   By river marge and reedless lake  
     Love makes her weary moan,  
   "O April sun, awake, awake!"  
     She sings alone, alone.  
   O hearts of men, make penance due  
     When April draws anear,  
   For life is false, but love is true,  
     And Spring is here, is here!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
O singing voice, the year is old and grey,  
Unto the tomb totters her shaking step.  
September has from April stolen dress  
And you by quick illusion are deceived.  
  
                   ETARRE  
One day, one night, one shift of moon and sun,  
Each year are stolen from the hoard of Spring  
And unto Autumn given. On that eve  
All flowers, unknown to sleep-enchanted eyes,  
Break into blossom from a withered stem,  
The trees are clothed in leaf, the faded stars  
Put on new splendour, and the drowsy earth  
With glow-worm hangs each branch and dewy bower.  
It is the year's farewell festivity  
Ere love be quenched and winter cold return,  
Ere bird fly southward under warmer skies  
And fourfoot beast to sunless lair retire.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
But we unharmed through rainy nights and chill  
Shall hear the storm about the towered walls,  
And in security close-wrapped shall laugh  
When winter's frosty fingers pierce and pry  
At every stone and corner, and the wind  
Cries like a beast unsheltered through the night.  
Yea, thou and I, caught in each other's arms,  
Shall dream of stormy battle overhead  
When winter with the giants of the north  
Sweeps down across the hills and smites the plain  
With desolation, when above the dead  
The whirling snow in burial descends,  
When waters are bound captive in strong chains,  
When wells are sealed, and rivers turned to stone.  
And I will tell thee many a tale and strange  
Of dark enchantment wrought in waking dreams,  
Of magic lawns, and flowers that backward draw,  
Of shields that burn in flame, and helms that raise  
Quick serpents clutching the unwarded blow.  
So shall we hold the icy fiend at scorn  
And waken endless summer in our breast,  
With love to sing to us, and love to clothe  
Our souls with gladness and our hearts with peace.  
  
                   ETARRE  
How many times I love thee, whom three days  
Have scarcely crowned, whom speech and look and thought  
Have scarce revealed! And yet a thousand suns  
Could with no lordlier radiance bind thy brows  
Nor with more light illumine.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                    Thou are dear  
As pearl deep-hidden in the lightless sea  
Which careless net a-search for other prey  
By chance drags upward to th' astounded light.  
One glance alone, one beam of shafted day,  
The wretched fisher clutches priceless wealth  
And needs no knowledge wrought of week and year  
To teach his fortune. So art thou to me,  
Revealed and perfect in an instant sight.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Hold me yet closer, let the living world  
Sink from me like wild stars that seek the night  
And downward vanish in the vast obscure.  
Quench yonder gleams that hold the dark in power,  
And ban yon moving shield of argent beam;  
Veil moon and stars, and draw me to thy own.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
O best endeared and sweet belovèd form,  
Thou art the earth's most precious heritage.  
A thousand years, she fashioned in the dark  
With labour and sad toil, and brought thee forth  
To be her fairest marvel all unstained.  
Thou art of summer nutured, light-enwrought,  
Cradled in southern flame.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                        The silent years  
In their dim fastness of forgotten days  
With virgin toil unrecompensed and lone  
Have fashioned me and brought me to thy lips.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
And now like shrouded mantles of the dawn  
Soft falling from the shoulders of the sun,  
They do reveal thee, girt and crowned with love,  
Thine inmost self, for utmost worship meet.  
  
                   ETARRE  
They have deserted me, like startled birds  
Rising from nook and deep recess of rock  
And wheeling, wheeling higher overhead,  
Till with a sudden impulse they depart  
And leave the watcher on the silent shore  
Alone and marvelling. So have they fled,  
My years of childhood and of maiden thought,  
My lonely years of growing womanhood,  
And I am left alone with love and thee,  
While at my feet the waters smite the shore,  
Wave after wave, in-coming from the deep.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Of that great time-swept ocean have no fear.  
The future is a snare to lead the eye  
Toward far horizons clouding the unknown.  
It is the present which our feet must tread  
And there our vision is the most unsheathed  
And we with least illusion can behold.  
Think not of years, but grasp the present day,  
And adamantine make the fleeting phase,  
Arrested and in memory's stone held fast,  
Carved with rich wonder, traced with strange design.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Ah would that Time thus stayed his course, or clipped  
The present hour and left it shorn of wings  
To be our prisoner! For evermore  
Should I so cling to thee, my lips upheld  
For thy sweet ardour and enkindled mouth,  
For ever so be clasped within thine arms,  
And dure eternity in thine embrace.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
All things save this can might of love fulfil.  
Love can of dew makes pearls and emeralds  
And build a palace of a ruined moat,  
From deepest forest charm the wingèd bird  
To minstrelsy and hymeneal song,  
And from the mountains draw the sullen wild  
To serve in quick attendance at the feast.  
With power of shadowed dreams and quickening thought  
Love is endowed: she chains eternal things  
To be her servant, binds th' unwilling moon,  
And draws the silver-threaded stars which weave  
The tapestries of heav'n. The golden sun,  
Which like a shuttle moves across the sky  
With strands alternate of the day and night,  
Becomes her slave and lives but for her word.  
For they that love are rulers of the earth  
And in their hands the future ages lie.  
                   \[ *A nightingale sings close at hand.* \]  
  
                   ETARRE  
Did I not say this night was caught from Spring?  
Hark April's nightingale who turns the dark  
To music, and with radiant voice proclaims  
That summer is not fled, nor autumn here.  
To bed! to bed! sweet bird; with weary eyes  
You'll see the dawn if he o'ertake you singing.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
And unto us that selfsame counsel turns  
And bids us sleep. Good night, sweet love, good night.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Kiss me once more, till love be bared indeed  
And I in sweet communion with thy thoughts  
Be drawn into thy life and be a dream  
Within thy mind, a pulse within thy heart. --  
Kiss me once more, till life forsake his toil  
Of mystic alchemy and hidden consonance  
Of soul with body, till he break his glass  
Wherein he visions that processional  
Of generation unto generation matched,  
That sequence of mankind and beast and bird  
Which marks his handicraft: kiss me once more,  
Until he merge my soul in deathless bond  
To thine, and in eternal union join  
Our mind and thought and will. -- Kiss me once more,  
Till heav'n and earth be reft of all their veils  
And robbed of their mysterious dark conceit,  
Till I behold the circles of the sun  
And see the pulsing of the day and night,  
Hear time upon his anvil forge the stars,  
And be at one with universal might. --  
Kiss me once more, and shatter earth and sky  
Hurl all to dissolution, and with stroke  
Of vast desire still that gigantic heart  
Whose beating is the living, moving world.  
Leave me alone with thee, set round with night,  
In universal dark of boundless space,  
Alone, alone. -- Kiss me, and so good night!  
\[ *She rises and comes forward to the entrance of the  
     pavilion, where she stands gazing out.* \]  
How silent treads the night, how soft and still,  
With finger at her lips to hush each sound,  
That none of those who bide beneath her care  
Shall with uneasy dreams be stirred, and wake.  
Sleep soft, ye woods and meadow-lands,  
Ye silent leaves and sleeping flowers.  
Pale primroses, and daisies, ye sweet eyes  
With which the earth looks out on heaven,  
Be still; all, all, be still.  
Farewell, ye stars which overhead  
Drift by with distant song.  
Moon wide-eyed, watch well;  
Watch well until the dawn.  
\[ *She lets fall the curtain across the entrance of the  
    pavilion, thus shrouding* GAWAINE *and her-  
    self from sight. The moon has now risen  
    high above the trees and bathes the stage in silver  
    light. A soft wind stirs the leaves. Their  
    rustling is taken up and transformed to music,  
    -- at first scarcely audible, but gradually grow-  
    ing in intensity,-- representing the sounds  
    of a late summer night.* \]  
  
\[ *The music stills.* PELLEAS *and* FERGUS *emerge  
    from the thicket on the right.* \]  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Stay still: no further move. Our question here  
Shall find its answer.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                   Know you what this means?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Rejoicing and festivity.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                       The rite  
Of burial.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
             What mean you?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                               That the dead  
From battle ride not home. You are betrayed.  
This is rejoicing for your death, festivity  
To honour him who slew you. For she holds  
That Gawaine with true victor's right and might  
Carries your shield and helm. You are betrayed.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Though mine own eyes beheld, I scarce should hold  
That such a knight to such a vow were false.  
'Tis Gawaine, born of Caerleon's royal blood,  
Whom you, low-born, attaint. With deadly vow  
He swore him faithful, and in utmost pledge  
Bound life and body to fulfil my love.  
These were his words upon my sword-hilt sworn:  
"If I be found unfaithful, changeful, false,  
May my bare throat feel this unsheathèd blade,  
May I be cast for ever from the light!"  
  
                   FERGUS  
The vow is forfeit. Go! reclaim the oath.  
They have no fear of you and set no guard.  
Etarre believes you dead, and Gawaine laughs.  
She shall remember that the dead arise  
To wreak their vengeance. In these tents are hid  
Sure proofs and testimony.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                             There remain,  
Within yon thicket hidden, till I come.  
\[FERGUS *draws back out of sight.* PELLEAS *advances  
up the slope toward the central pavilion.* \]  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Is this the timid prey which ran to earth  
Close harried, and like mole which dreads the light  
Drew shut her portals? This is she who feared  
My least approach, who with armed battlement  
Greeted my coming and with moat unbridged  
Bade welcome. These soft silks and drooping fanes  
Point mockery, as though they scorned to hide  
That which they cannot guard.  
    \[ *He has approached the curtain of the pavilion.* \]  
                                       So comes the thief  
At dead of night on foul endeavour bent,  
So peers to left and right with fearing eye,  
And so on tip-toe to his booty draws.  
O watching powers of darkness and deceit,  
Grant that I be the very thief and true,  
And not myself the stolen-from, the robbed,  
The injured one down-tracking to his lair  
The plucking knave and claiming back his own!  
\[ *He raises the curtain and peers in. After a moment  
   he suddenly starts back.* \]  
O sight too horrible for mortal eyes,  
Burning the eye-ball with a blackened scar  
Of infamy and loathing! Oh, be blind,  
Twice injured eyes. Look not again on light.  
Clothe yourselves round with darkness, and forget  
This fatal gift of seeing! O accursed,  
O nest of shame breeding repugnant brood  
Of broken oaths and false virginity!  
Now is the scroll of knighthood ended; fame  
Forsakes her ancient stronghold of renown.  
The days of chivalry are past, and knights  
With plea insidious of inviolate oath  
Work treason and adultery. This was Etarre,  
The maiden ivory in her chastity,  
With eyes downcast for fear of shame; and now  
Her lips are drawn apart with hungry sin  
And like a serpent feast on evil fruit.  
O night, how canst thou sleep so still? Up! Wake!  
With hundred voices clamour at this deed,  
And loose the hell-hounds of your winds and storms  
To sweep into destruction's cloven pit  
This treachery and crime! O bitterness of man,  
To see his life down-trodden and the dust  
Of wild despair heap charnel mounds and whirl  
In mockery, while Heaven lifts no hand,  
The oceans are unmoved, the river-floods  
Within their channels tarry, wind and fire  
Their ancient office elsewhere do perform,  
And moon and star smile in serenity!  
Forsaken, thrice forsaken, with his grief  
Man wrings no pity. The great world is stone;  
God holds himself aloof, cold, passionless,  
Wrapt in designs of far eternities.  
Spurning the race which shudders at his feet,  
He fashions future kingdoms. Weak, alone,  
From death unsheltered, bearing wounds and ill  
In life upgathered, man cries out in vain  
For judge of evil, champion 'gainst the wrong.  
But I, though I be so forsaken, scorned of God,  
Unheard of earth and Heaven, yet shall I  
Fulfil my vengeance, with unaided hand,  
And right the wrong and champion the true!  
False Nature, cry farewell to children twain  
Whom hast thou nurtured into infamy;  
Thou canst not save them! here, against thy will,  
I slay them, and in mockery of thee.  
\[ *Lifting the curtain of the pavilion with one hand,  
   and with the other holding his drawn sword,  
   he enters and disappears from view. He  
   re-emerges.* \]  
And is it manhood so to halt and fail,  
To hide the sword of vengeance in the sheath  
Of pity? Thought and deed wage mutual war,  
And deed is conquered; the weak thought prevails.  
So let them sleep; I cannot slay them now. --  
               \[ *He turns to go, but halts suddenly.* \]  
What, let that injury to all my hopes  
So slumber on, so let that shameless word  
Sleep unavenged? --  
                      Ah me, how still they lay!  
Gawaine at peace, half god-like in his dreams,  
And she like carven statue motionless,  
Her lips half-smiling, her dark-lidded eyes  
Soft closed, and one white hand against her breast  
As though her lover still within her clasp  
Lay sleeping. --  
                O deep misery accursed  
To find Etarre at last, and find her so!  
Am I by craft of wizardry encharmed  
That all my thoughts are shades and fleshless dreams?  
With maiden weakness here I stand and weep  
As though I had no strength of hand, no sword  
To bring me vengeance, and no warrior's will  
To punish proved deceit and oath forsworn.  
Unto my mercy's prayer I cast Etarre  
For pittance, but my anger's deadly curse  
Shall Gawaine take, and with the stroke of death  
Drive out his soul from earthly dwelling place  
And ban for ever from the living world.  
\[ *He re-enters the pavilion. After a little, he re-emerges.* \]  
Sleep on, sleep on, I cannot slay you here.  
On field of battle, waking and full-armed,  
I'll slay you; but not here, not now, asleep,  
Unarmed, defenceless. Though you traitor be,  
Of knighthood's stroke unworthy, yet am I  
A knight, and with that sacred oath am bound  
To slay no sleeping man nor foe unarmed,  
To battle with the sword and not, as they  
Who slay their sheep for feasting, to approach  
With sharpened knife the victim's helpless throat.  
Not so in cowardice was knighthood framed,  
Not so adorned for valour. Nay, sleep on.  
You've wronged me more than thousand deaths could pay;  
To take a single life so wretchedly  
Were but a mockery of payment. Nay, sleep on,  
And if your dreams affright you, be at ease;  
For that grim shadow, standing at your bed  
And with malign intent upon your life  
Down-gazing, is departed and returns  
No more to vex you. Ay, sleep on, sleep on.  
\[ *He proceeds down the slope. At the foot of the  
    slope he is met by* FERGUS.\]  
  
                   FERGUS  
And was it other than I said?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                 Full well  
Your heart's malignity foretold me truth.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Gawaine is false?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                  The night with darkling robe  
No falser thing conceals.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                          Where are they hid?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Yonder pavilion holds the twain as one.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Then have you slain them, meted that reward  
Alone sufficient and well-earned?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                       They live.  
  
                   FERGUS  
You had not power, not opportunity  
To fall upon them; they were held in guard  
Or otherway from you removed?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                                      Unwatched  
Their couch, unarmed they sleep and lone.  
  
                   FERGUS  
And are not dead! Are you of honour reft,  
Of resolution shorn, of anger void!  
Unmoved you know yourself betrayed and spurned,  
Laughed at and mocked, your prize of ten long years  
Snatched from you in a day, and all your life  
O'ercast with sorrow. Have you not a sword?  
Do swords not slay? Alas, suspicion grows;  
This is not Pelleas who held the field  
Of armoured knights at nought! This is a shade,  
And Pelleas by years of pining love  
Is grown too frail for manhood, and too weak  
For anger. Quick, take sword, and slay;  
Set seal of blood on this foul testament.  
Match deed to deed. Send me with hungry knife  
And I will slay, and take the fault, the shame,  
If you have found a fault in such a right,  
A shame in such a work of injured honour.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
I cannot slay a sleeping knight, nor turn  
The pointed sword against a woman's breast.  
Let us depart this most unhallowed spot  
Lest quick contagion which is here abroad  
Should with its ill infect us.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                       Unavenged  
You would depart, and leave no trace behind,  
No proof of anger, no memorial  
To that dishonourable union set,  
As though you were the spirit of the wind  
Across the moors, trailing nor track nor sign  
To mark your presence? Shall they wake at dawn  
And fill another day with wretched love,  
And deem themselves secure and laugh at thought  
Of Pelleas?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
              Well said, a sign, a sign  
That I am not a shadow, but a man,  
A fleshly thing with mortal strength of arm,  
A threat of punishment, a deadly fear  
Unsilenced in their hearts.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                        Ay, still their hearts.  
This is the sign I meant, the sign of death,  
That all men may take knowledge to themselves  
And learn what thing it is thus to forswear  
All honour, and in treason to be false  
To Pelleas. These two together slain  
Shall be a history to all mankind,  
A legend and a saying.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                        Here remain  
Yet once again until the deed be done.  
I shall exact his oath.  
                 \[ *He ascends toward the pavilion.* \]  
  
                   FERGUS  
                     Praise be to Heaven!  
The ancient valour is returned, to swell  
High flood of vengeance and exact the oath.  
How ran the words wherewith he pledged his life?  
"May my bare throat feel this unsheathèd blade,  
May I be cast for ever from the light!"  
Then is he slain.  
                     \[PELLEAS *enters the pavilion.* \]  
                   And yet his temper burns  
Like sudden sun upon an April day,  
Hot for the moment but too soon o'ercast.  
Let me go up and strengthen his resolve  
Lest at the last he weaken.  
\[ *He moves toward the pavilion.* PELLEAS *comes out.* \]  
                           Ah, returned,  
So soon returned. He had not time to fail.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
It is fulfilled. Across his naked throat  
My sword has gone.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                     And he is slain in truth!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Slain? Nay, not slain, but sleeping as before.  
So let them sleep until the morning comes  
To waken them and they behold my sword  
Across their breasts, close drawn beneath their throats,  
A sign, in symbol of a broken oath.  
Comes, let us go; the night draws on apace.  
  
                   FERGUS  
O idle hope to dream that he was dead,  
By vengeance over taken! No! return;  
Not so that oath was sworn, not such th' intent;  
With death he bargained. Let him death receive.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
What I have done is with full purpose wrought.  
Come, let us go; the night draws on apace.  
\[ *They disappear into the thicket. A cloud crosses  
   the moon, and a sudden gust of wind shakes the trees.* \]  
  
  
                   **CURTAIN**  
  
  
  
                   **ACT FOUR**  
  
*SCENE: In the Castle of* ETARRE. *A hall, with  
   windows overlooking a central court. Early  
   morning of a gloomy day.*  
  
                   ETARRE  
Find me some counsel, for with wrath and hate  
My senses are disordered. Let me turn  
And hide myself for ever; here close-walled  
Within my castle, let me sit and brood  
On man's dishonour and my fallen pride.  
Let me no more be seen of foreign eye  
Lest memory's brand draw fire across my cheek  
And I turn hot with shame. Ah, so deceived  
And in deception so displayed to him  
Who most was wronged! Speak! is there no escape?  
Do all the paths draw close their hedgèd walks  
And bar the way? And you who sang of love,  
For day and night unwearied in your rhyme,  
Know you no counsel?  
  
                   AILEEN  
                       None of wrath and hate.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Shall I be loving? with corruptive name  
Call falsehood truth and welcome all deceit?  
  
                   AILEEN  
You are not stricken so beyond all health  
That you must turn to death for comfort, -- ay,  
Keep house with grief and marry with despair.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Then on my sickness lay some remedy;  
Pluck me some healing herb of sweet advice.  
  
                   AILEEN  
Forgive, forget. These are most heav'nly sounds  
Which to discordant actions concord bring  
And work harmonious union. Gawaine sleeps  
And of th' event knows nothing. Be as he:  
Know not of broken slumber and a sword.  
Nurture no counsel of unquiet mind  
Against his fault; he loves you well and true  
And there no falsehood lies.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                         Forgive! forget!  
Forget that to these walls came Gawaine riding,  
With victor's helm and plume, and with false word  
Cried Pelleas dead? Forget my joyful praise,  
My love which was but thankfulness of heart  
Upraised in gratitude? Forgive the lie  
Wherewith he lured my thanks and bought my love,  
The lie wherewith he sealed my lips and eyes  
And to deep slumber bound me, while another,  
Him whom he boasted slain, within my tent  
In musing stood and saw me in my shame  
And with a naked sword cursed me and him  
With whom I slept? Forgive, you say? forget?  
Not till the mated wolf forget his lair  
Shall I forget, nor till the son forgive  
The slayer of his sire, shall I forgive.  
  
                   AILEEN  
You judge too harshly, with a view too near,  
Like them who hillocks into mountains raise  
Because they stand beneath them, head thrown back  
And eyes upcast, unknown that from afar  
These hillocks merge into the level plain.  
No deadly work of ancient kingdoms lost,  
Armed hosts betrayed and knights in prison slain,  
Has Gawaine wrought. He lied? nay, what of that?  
With false pretence won favour? 'tis no crime.  
He was with love intentioned: men are fain  
To overstep the fettered pace of honour  
When love's the goal. And do you think him base  
Claiming another's death, thereby to gain  
Your love, when to have held the ways of truth  
Led to a loveless issue?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                        You would make  
Fair winds from stormy quarters blow, and set  
The northern sun in winter skies. With words  
False-founded on the marsh of shifting thought  
You'll not persuade me.  
  
                   AILEEN  
                       But by surer proof,  
Rock-built and firm, which never wind of doubt  
Can shake to earth. Though Gawaine falsely wrought  
And with dishonour entered covenant,  
Let past be past, and mingle not its gall  
With present mead, lest bitter be the draught.  
Gawaine you love; and for that love's fair sake  
Rouse not the past against him.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                    Love and hate  
Hang not on every moment's fleeting lure,  
But from dead hours and withered years depend.  
Past thoughts do act upon our present mood  
And get new children; men are fools, who think  
This deathless creature, time, was ever held  
Within the coffin: there's no hour o' the day  
But lives for ever in unlessened strength;  
No mightier love in earth or ocean dwells  
Than that between the present and the past,  
And none more fruitful. Ay, forget the past?  
Forget the dark which quenches every fire  
Within my heart, and in unmindful bliss  
Call Gawaine pure, a knight without a stain?  
  
                   AILEEN  
And is he so dishonoured?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                            Let me speak,  
Let me be herald and proclaim his deed;  
For now I mind me of a word he said,  
A truthful tale for lying purpose told.  
His was a quest to win a lady's love,  
Not for himself, he said, -- O guileful claim! --  
But for another. I, with idle wit,  
Knew not 'twas Pelleas of whom he spoke  
And mine the heart which he was sent to win.  
'Twas thus that with another's helm and shield  
He came disguised; but not as conqueror, --  
As servant bearing message to my halls.  
And like a servant to his master false  
He decked himself with borrowed finery  
And played a stolen part.  
  
                   AILEEN  
                            'Twas not a slave  
Who played the master, but the royal lord  
In servile garb demeaned. You are unkind  
To make comparison with things unlike  
And thence draw profit.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                        He has cast aside  
The cloak of honour, thrown the sceptre down,  
The kingly staff of faith, whereby we rule  
Ourselves and others. Perjured and forsworn,  
To knighthood false, to fellow-knight untrue,  
He wrought upon me with unrighteous deed  
Which to his oath proved mortal and betrayed  
His embassy.  
  
                   AILEEN  
              It is himself he harms,  
Not others. Pelleas whom you never loved  
Is not of love defrauded. What, forget?  
You say to heav'n, you cannot so forget?  
You have forgotten in an hour's short span  
Ten years of hatred.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                       Nay! I love him not!  
Yet, when I see a knight so wronged, the tears  
Of pity well unbidden to mine eyes  
In quick compassion; when I think on him,  
Betrayed by Gawaine and from hope exiled,  
Spurning revenge and to his sleeping foe  
Soft pity granting, can I nourish hate  
Against a grief so nobly self-endured,  
Knighthood so proven?  
  
                   AILEEN  
                           What of grief he bore  
Through ten cruel years, knighthood so nobly shown  
In joust and battle, dungeon and disgrace?  
Well, let him stand forgiven: light the fires  
Of your resentment, kindle torture-flames,  
And unto Gawaine turn your restless hate.  
Let him like purest ore be doubly proved  
In midmost heat of anger, till the dross  
Of foolish pride and guileful deed be shed  
And golden faith emerge. He will repent  
And with contrition turn to them he wronged,  
Suing for pardon.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                  He shall sue in vain  
If unto me he turn.  
  
                AILEEN \[ *at the window* \]  
                         Within the court  
Rain-drops begin to fall; the western wind  
From stormy ocean journeys, with the net  
Wherewith he dragged the sea for water-drops  
Across his shoulders flung, dripping with rain.  
His cloak upcast, he hides the morning sun  
And with his fisher's hat throws giant shade  
On all the hills. Look well upon his ways,  
For in your soul there strides a shadow vast  
Hiding the sunlight of clear thought and love  
With clouds of anger, fraught with fall of tears.  
  
                   ETARRE  
'Twas but a phantom sun at midnight sent,  
A wisp o' the marshes, caught among the stars.  
  
                   AILEEN  
'Twas the great sun in heav'n, and you have spurned  
God's utmost gift, the light wherewith men see.  
For love is as a light within the eyes,  
And with it vision enters, bird and beast  
Wax cunning, the fierce eagle's sight is bared  
Where like a drifting point against the clouds  
He holds his guard; swallows and singing birds  
Gather their tribe and nation, and unvexed  
Go pilgrimage; who guides them on their way?  
Who taught the thrush to build his nest, the mole  
To dig his halls and chambers? Well you know  
Desire of life, desire of love, alone  
Give these their knowledge; river-fish depart  
On distant journey to the ocean stream  
And yet return; the woodland deer with fawn  
Sees huntsman while the hounds are yet in leash;  
And arrows miss their prey in summer months.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Fine threads of fancy, airy webs of thought;  
They touch me not.  
  
                   AILEEN  
                    Then hear a grosser tale.  
It is not well that woman's hand should rule  
By man unaided, for in weaker mould  
Her body's strength is fashioned, and her mind  
Trembles before assault. Bright fortune's star  
Has watched above you, for the hounds of war  
Have never drawn their trail across your land,  
And that grim huntsman, who with double stroke  
Slays foe and friend, has passed these regions by;  
'Twas far away we heard the clamorous tongues  
Of questing hounds, and cry of men a-chase.  
But war returns: one quarry run to earth  
And slain in bloody moil, his hounds find scent  
Of other prey. Across the harvest-fields  
He spurs the hunt, through villages asleep,  
By moat and grange, through breadth of all the land.  
And when beneath your walls his bugles blow  
And you with woman's strength of arm and will  
Must bold confront him, you will shrink afraid;  
The walls with stroke of iron-girded beam,  
The shaken portals, towers down-ravening,  
Shall with disaster terrify your sense.  
Yield unto man his heritage of power;  
His is the crown of courage, his the strength  
Which bides unmoved the deadly front of war.  
To man, but yesternight, you gave your love  
And to his passion yielded sense and soul;  
To-day you cry release and would reclaim  
Th' irrevocable compact. -- Let me speak!  
You wrong me with your anger! At your gates  
A wanderer stands, with staff and laden scrip;  
Upon his brow is written peace, his hands  
A scroll upraise; he bears the hidden sword  
Of safety, and the cup of heart's content.  
You turn him from your gates, because his feet  
Are travel-stained, because he wears a cloak  
From others taken, and the scroll reads false.  
Be well advised; this pilgrim comes but once;  
Throw wide your doors, cry Welcome, he is here!  
  
                   ETARRE  
I close my portals to him; from the walls  
I herald him be gone. You fan the flame  
Of anger in me.  
                                    \[GAWAINE *enters* .\]  
  
                ETARRE \[ *to* AILEEN\]  
                 Let me be alone.  
     \[AILEEN *goes out while* GAWAINE *is speaking* .\]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Must love at touch of dawn his dreams dispel  
And from his kingdom flee? Through empty halls  
I've sought in vain.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                    With scrutiny more keen  
Instruct your failing eyes. I am not she  
For whom you search.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                    Why, you are changed indeed.  
Are you some flower that blossoms in the night  
And in the day with envious stalk of thorns  
Enfolds its chalice? With unfriendly mien  
You look upon me, warn me with set frown,  
Chill me with loveless words. Are you not she  
Who yesternight beneath the flaming stars  
Vowed me eternal love? You are not she!  
The day has raised its sword and cleft apart  
That union of our souls. What have I wrought  
Amiss, what deed to love untrue?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                 Demand  
Of your own heart.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                   'Tis dark, pierced with no light  
Of knowledge.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                Nought is to you better known.  
It is forever in your waking mind;  
The day has written it in thousand hues  
Across your vision; wheresoe'er you turn  
'Tis burnt and carven in your inmost thought;  
The cocks have crowed it in their morning song,  
And every word men speak points thumb to it.  
You cannot sleep but in your deepest dream  
It shows its pattern.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                      What is this you know?  
Have I with slumb'ring spirit's drowsy sense  
Some foolish tale unfolded? Men believe  
The waking words and not th' illusive dream.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Your lips betrayed you not: they are too well  
In silence schooled.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                    Then is some message come,  
Some lying tale from sland'rous lips of men?  
  
                   ETARRE  
Nor spoken word, nor written.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                      From the walls  
You saw some vision to affright your mind  
Against me?  
  
                   ETARRE  
               Ay, the golden king of day  
Held prisoner in gloomy halls: nought else.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Why, then rejoice, and laugh at wind and rain.  
Come, kiss me; and confess you penitent  
That dawn should wake me in an empty world  
And rob me of the fairest jewel of day.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Plant flowers to close the grave where murder lies,  
With golden portal seal the beggar's hut,  
But this you cannot hide.  
\[ *From behind a curtain she drags out the sword of* PELLEAS.\]  
                         Know you this sword?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
'Tis but a sword: I know it not.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                    The hilt  
Has graven letters: hearken their device,  
"The son of Ork; be strong and hold me fast."  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Pelleas! the sword! Tell me, whence came the sword?  
Who brought it to your hands?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                            Who else but he?  
Pelleas the slain, the dead knight from his grave!  
  
                   GAWAINE  
Through shadows of the early day he crept  
And in your ear dropped poison? told you all,  
With bitter words probed deep his injury,  
And searched the vitals of his hate!  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                    I know  
But this, that Pelleas lives and can avenge,  
That you have dealt with perjury and shame.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
You know that I have falsely wrought, have lied,  
Worked with untruth: these things you know full well.  
You know not that I was by Pelleas sent,  
By him enarmed, trusted with tale of death.  
You think not of the strife within my soul,  
Unbodied forces in contention thrown  
For mastery within me. Do you mind  
How you with praise assailed me, with soft word  
And glance? Not I, not I, who played me false,  
But you who brought me ruin. 'Twas a vow,  
Upon this very hilt 'twas given oath,  
And now it is betrayed. It was a knight,  
Who in great tourney won this very sword,  
And now he is betrayed. You ask me, Why?  
With Wherefore vex me -- you who know so well!  
Your eyes, your lips, your body's silver form,  
These are the Wherefore, these the cunning cause,  
So deadly, so corruptive to the mind,  
That were the deed undone, and I to choose,  
I'd choose against all honour, and with you  
Blind out this pallid ghost of knighthood, drown  
Reproach, and strangle recompense.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                       Away!  
Mine eyes are stricken with the sight of you  
And inward turn, praying for some release  
From this most bitter vision. You have dared  
To wed me with the broken ring of faith  
Forsworn; you've snapped in twain the lute of joy,  
And Happiness, bright minister of God,  
That solitary hermit who descends  
But once a year from his eternal rocks  
Into the market-place of men, you've crowned  
With crown of thorns, dealt stripes and buffeting  
And sent him back into the desert heights  
To weep forlorn. You've brought me grief and hate,  
And now 'tis I who wronged you, I who led  
Your helpless honour to dishonour's grave!  
Away! and come not ever to these halls  
Lest I forget my woman's heritage  
And like a man avenge me.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                             Give me word,  
And let me speak. For much pleads with my cause  
And with me makes defence.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                             The very night,  
Which shelters crime and to the deeds of sin  
Accords its refuge and unhallowed screen,  
Betrayed you. I have heard and seen and judged,  
Yea, judged too kindly, leaned too much aside  
To mercy. Go! And if you here remain,  
You idly wait: here shall I not set foot  
Until within the court I know the hoofs  
Of your departing steed bear from my life  
Its cruelest injury.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                    No steed have I  
Who am alone in all the land.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                  Then take  
From out my stables. Quick! make haste and go.  
              \[ *She turns abruptly and leaves the room* .\]  
  
                   GAWAINE  
So shatters that mysterious glass of love  
Wherein delight was mirrored; so departs  
That glorious ray, and so the night returns  
With all its solitude. Lo, I am cast  
For ever from the light! Farewell, Etarre;  
You were unkind, and with a passion's storm  
Brought devastation to the garden-close  
Wherein love blossomed. Wrath and fiercest hate  
Were never of a speedier onset borne,  
And the red flight of hell was never stirred  
To such a fury. On the mound which marks  
Your love's decease, my thought shall plant a spray  
Of budding thorn for memory. Mighty Heaven,  
That on our thought and action holdest count,  
Bear witness in thy universal scroll,  
I am misjudged! \[ *pausing suddenly* \] Or am I judged aright?  
To quick repentance should I turn, or hate?  
Be scornful or be sad?  
                                   \[ *He turns to go* .\]  
                          What's done is done.  
Close meditation's gloomy book of fears;  
I'll read no more in it.  
                                    \[FERGUS *enters* .\]  
                       Who's here?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                     I came  
With other hopes than these, not thought to find  
Gawaine within the land.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                          Yes, you are he  
Who on the moors thought every wind which blew  
Christened the serf with knighthood, equal made  
Low born and high.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                    And of false wooers spake  
A word not unfulfilled.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                      That rankling tongue  
Has learned no better trade than erst it knew.  
  
                   FERGUS  
No better trade than truth.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                              Nor lighter curb  
Than that which silences for ever.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                     Knight,  
If knight you be, who so with knighthood deal,  
Ill taught am I in that mysterious lore  
Whereof my master speaks; 'tis honour called.  
It bids us spare the foe when at our feet  
He crumpled lies; when prison doors spring wide,  
It spurns escape; when fortune to our hands  
Has brought, unarmed and sleeping, our revenge,  
It falters in its anger. 'Tis a staff  
Which leads us into regions insecure  
And robber-haunted ways. It is a lance  
Which backward wounds, a double-toothèd sword.  
I am not learned in this subtle craft;  
For me a single law sufficient rules, --  
To help my friend and slay mine enemy.  
And when I hear this speech of low and high,  
Base-born and noble, I am much perplexed --  
  
                   GAWAINE  
As all men are, with what they cannot grasp.  
  
                   FERGUS  
One truth I know, one truth I grasp secure.  
You have betrayed my master, worked him wrong  
As only death can pay. He has released  
That mortal payment, left you all unharmed;  
And you, who know how great a debt is here,  
Unmoved remain within these halls. Take horse  
And ride with all the cudgels of the wind  
To speed your flight! Or else on bended knee  
Cry his forgiveness; praise that noble heart  
Which unto anger turns not; to all men  
Bear forth the shield of his tranquillity,  
Recount his deed in every festival  
And at the door of kings proclaim his worth.  
Go forth in penance. You have worked a deed  
Which I, low born, of honour all untaught,  
Should hold too black for doing.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                                  May the fiends  
In cauldron's brazen darkness thrust you down!  
Such taunts with th' sword are answered, not with words.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Such taunts are written in the book of deeds  
Where every word is truth. You dare not slay,  
Who with a guilty eye stare out on me  
And with fear's ague tremble to behold  
Your deed confronted.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                        Then, false deed, be still,  
And never more between those lips be cast  
To work me slander.  
     \[ *He draws his sword against* FERGUS.\]  
  
                   FERGUS  
                     You have slain enough.  
First 'twas your honour which you stabbed to heart  
And with that stroke to Pelleas' happiness  
Dealt mortal blow; then 'twas a virgin name  
Which you from life despatched with lusting hand;  
And now on pardon's messenger you turn  
Your deadly blade.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                    Unclothe that mystery,  
And let me look on naked form of thought,  
Not on these wordy veils. What message comes?  
What is this pardon you are sent to bring?  
  
                   FERGUS  
'Tis dead. Lest it should fall between your hands,  
I've slain it. Go, and dream that mad revenge  
With dripping foam upon her speechless lips  
Is on your track, pursuing with red feet  
In murder dabbled, and with rabble-rout  
Of demons plucking at your fleeing hair.  
  
                   GAWAINE  
So have you driven the last bolt and bar  
Across your tomb.  
    \[ *He strides with drawn sword against* FERGUS.\]  
  
                   FERGUS  
                  And so with blade drawn bare  
Stood Pelleas above your sleeping couch  
And at your throat set hate's envenomed point;  
Yet spared you, spared you in your marriage sleep  
Which was to his lone love the sleep of death.  
Have you from mercy's high example learned  
No lowly creed?  
  
                   GAWAINE  
                Within our tent, you say?  
Above our couch? What? found me lain with her  
And took no vengeance?  
  
                                       \[ *After a pause* .\]  
              Verily, 'tis here,  
Knighthood's most glorious pattern to all time  
Mercy's most perfect counterpart. Be sheathed,  
Mad sword of hate; be still, and strive no more;  
In other lands we'll seek a nobler crown  
And bear this emblem of bright chivalry  
Blazoned within our heart.  
\[ *He turns and leaves the room. Through the opposite  
   door* AVRAN *enters* .\]  
  
                   AVRAN  
High words were here, and wrangle of dispute.  
Are you alone? Whence came that sound of strife  
Which from the rampart drew me?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                                 'Twas a tale  
Which I to me recounted, of a knight.  
Who did foul deeds with fairest countenance.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Two voices quarrelled. Who was here with you?  
And how within these halls came you alone?  
  
                   FERGUS  
'Twas Gawaine bringing me a last farewell;  
And as for me I seek some knight-at-arms  
To carry urgent message to Etarre.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Whence come you?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                    From the hill and open moors  
Where we inhabit.  
  
                   AVRAN  
                 Whom is it you serve?  
  
                   FERGUS  
The greatest knight in all the western land.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Has he a name, that I may know of him?  
  
                   FERGUS  
A name that to your hearing rings not strange.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Then let me know it.  
  
                   FERGUS  
                        Pelleas is the name.  
  
                   AVRAN  
Are you his servant?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                      With a message here  
That Pelleas with Etarre would speak.  
  
                   AVRAN  
                                           You come  
On venture profitless. From open door  
You'll see dismissal beckoning your flight.  
Etarre has only hatred. Get you gone.  
  
                   FERGUS  
Do you not know, the sparrows in the rain  
Of early morning hold another speech  
Than that of sunlight and clear day?  
  
                   AVRAN  
                                       And what  
Portends that saying?  
  
                   FERGUS  
                       Do you tell Etarre  
That Pelleas is at hand, and would be heard.  
There is a change come over heaven's demean  
And other forces rule; this message bear  
While I in search of Pelleas am departed.  
                                 \[ *He goes out* .\]  
  
                   AVRAN  
How insolent he stares; his vaunting tongue  
Bristles with pride. Yet shall it soon be dulled,  
And like the thistle's head lie low, cut short  
By all the scythes of anger.  
                               \[ETARRE *enters* .\]  
  
                   ETARRE  
                        He is fled.  
  
                   AVRAN  
This very moment gone.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                          I marked his step  
Some minute since within the court; how say you  
This very moment gone?  
  
                   AVRAN  
                            But, as you entered  
He did depart. How know you of him?  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                            Whom?  
Of Gawaine?  
  
                   AVRAN  
            No; this knavish messenger  
Who plumes himself with dappled tints of pride,  
And like a mating bird struts high.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                Whom mean you?  
  
                   AVRAN  
'Twas one from Pelleas come --  
  
                   ETARRE  
                        What, come from Pelleas?  
Good fortune works communion with my wish.  
What said he? Is he yet within the land?  
  
                   AVRAN  
Are you so eager, where I looked for scorn's  
Fierce speech of hatred; nor for such a tone --  
  
                   ETARRE  
Will you destroy me with impatience? Quick,  
What said he?  
  
                   AVRAN  
                Word most insolent and vile;  
That Pelleas with Etarre demanded speech.  
Here is affront o'ertopping all offence.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Where is he?  
  
                   AVRAN  
           Near at hand. His servant went  
To fetch him hither.  
  
                   ETARRE  
                       Then take haste to wife  
And with all speed bring Pelleas to my sigh.  
                                \[AVRAN *goes out* .\]  
  
                   ETARRE  
How wretched are the dead, to whom remains  
No holy power in reparation's wand  
Transmuting into gold their baser deeds.  
Within the narrow channels of the grave  
They think upon their sins, and with no word  
Can alter that which erst they wrought amiss.  
The past cries out against them with its wrongs,  
And mem'ry presses for revenge. They writhe  
In all the torments of contrition's wheel  
And backward gace upon their crooked years  
Which nought can straighten. Happiest are they  
Who in this life their evil ways discover  
And with repentant eyes trace out anew  
The virtue whence they strayed. O holy stream  
Of penitence, wash out this wretched stain  
Of passion false and unrestrained desire.  
Give me the love which I have spurned, lead back  
My life to those remoter happier days  
And let my changèd heart atone to Pelleas.  
                              \[PELLEAS *enters* .\]  
  
                   PELLEAS  
It much repents me, this unhappy night  
Wherein I brought dissension's toothèd fiends  
To tear your love asunder. Anger's spur  
Too wanton played, and hate's distempered hand  
Caught from me that soft robe of gentle thought  
Which from barbaric nakedness enclothes  
Our wretched souls. That golden crown I lost  
And with unworthy passion rode afield.  
If words can gain forgiveness to a deed,  
Forgive me.  
  
                   ETARRE  
               Nay; for how shall I forgive,  
Nurse others into virtue, and myself  
Be sick with every vice? 'Tis not the poor,  
The starveling beggar of the street, who gives  
Unto the rich.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                 The leper gives his blessing  
And 'tis as holy as the touch of kings.  
But you who are in mercy rich, forgive.  
  
                   ETARRE  
Have I been merciful and set the bowl  
Of pity at my gates? I am a fiend  
From heav'nly sorrow shut; the very stones  
Within these walls are with more mercy fraught.  
Ten years of wrong have left you still as pure  
In your forgiveness as a youth who dreams  
All wrong illusive, all the world of gold.  
I come before you, penitent and shamed,  
Before your stainless honour throw me down  
And clasp the knees of mercy. In the house  
Of your long-garnered misery and ill  
Can you yet find the grains of pity stored  
And uncorrupted?  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                  I have wrongly done.  
Ten years I have assailed you, made your life  
Most bitter to your lips, and at the last,  
When love before your castle held his steed,  
At dead of night across his sleeping eyes  
Set fire of deadly vision. Let me go,  
To death and danger my atonement make,  
And seek in new adventure novel crown  
To bind my fading glory. I forgive,  
If aught there be whereon forgiveness waits.  
Take Gawaine to you; from his erring throat  
Draw back the sword which I have laid athwart,  
And let that curse be broken in your heart  
As in my heart it now long shattered lies.  
My sword, the hilt of Ork, the tourney's meed,  
Return to me. "Be strong and hold me fast,"  
So is it written.  
                   \[ETARRE *gives him the sword* .\]  
  
                   ETARRE  
               Leave me not alone!  
Look, I am changed; this mouth at breast of hate  
No more draws milk, these eyes no more seek light  
From wells of angry fire. Oh, leave me not!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Through break of dawn I heard the distant horns  
Of wild adventure from new countries blowing.  
Let me forget as I have now forgiven.  
Be still, dead years, and let me seek the world  
Where battles break like ocean's stormy surge,  
Where glory hides beneath the passing leaf  
And fame upon her highroad journeys far.  
  
                   ETARRE  
O dread event, and is thy vision true?  
Last night within my fairest dreams appeared  
The warders of the haunted well, and stretched  
Their hands in supplication. "Choose," they said.  
And I unto that ancient crone replied,  
And knew that she should comfort me, not stir  
My heart to the wild dreams of youth. "You choose  
The past," they said, and vanished from my sight.  
And I awoke, and cold against my throat  
The sword of anger pressed. Gawaine is fled;  
I drove him from me with contemptuous word  
And unto you with sudden passion turned  
Who so have loved me. Do not you depart.  
Make me your helpmate, teach me your great faith,  
And let me live as you have lived and wrought.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
I cannot love you now. This naked sword  
Has cloven us for ever. Hark, the horns!  
  
                   ETARRE  
I hear no sound.  
  
                   PELLEAS  
                The horns! hark, how they ring!  
The horns of wild adventure in my heart  
Calling to battle! calling. . . .  
  
                   ETARRE  
                                     Give me love!  
  
                   PELLEAS  
Now are the seas of pity troubled deep  
Within my breast. I cannot love. Love comes  
Unheard, unseen; in silence so departs.  
Our ears are not attuned to melody  
Of his sweet progress. Those ethereal sounds  
Vanish within us in a dust of sense.  
For who has heard the fingers of the sun  
That sweep across the lyre-strings of the rain?  
What mortal ear with sweet enchantment's touch  
Has heard the moving stars at play, or caught  
The magic silver song of floating moon  
Whereby the waves like charmèd birds are drawn?  
We are too grossly fashioned. Who has heard  
The midnight hammer of the winter frost  
Spanning the rivers with an icy bridge,  
Or caught the ringing of his chisels keen  
Cutting the tracery of fern and flower  
In wayside rut and frozen marsh and pool?  
We cannot hear the footfalls of the Spring,  
Nor answering cry of blossoms underneath  
In winter darkness waiting for the sun.  
And Love we cannot hear. He comes and goes,  
And no man sees him. Think me not unkind  
So passionless to answer. Love is fled,  
Unheard in silence. But the horns of war,  
These ring and cry within my ears. Farewell!  
There is some madness caught upon my life  
And drawing me away. Hark, hark, the horns!  
Farewell, and live in peace for all your days.  
\[ *He suddenly stoops to kiss her forehead; then without  
   a word departs* .\]  
  
                   ETARRE  
Stay, stay! You are betraying me to death!  
O life! O life! Broken the empty shell,  
Withered the kernel. Naught remains. The night  
Closes upon me with its memories;  
The curtain of my life descends to veil  
All happiness for ever from mine eyes.  
                       \[ *She turns to the window* .\]  
Lo, he departs: and from my spirit flee  
All present joys, all future ecstasies,  
And nought remains save only thought withheld  
Upon the visions of adventured days.  
                                                      \[ *A pause* .\]  
Meseems that I have always loved the past,  
And now within those halls, so drear and pale,  
My habitation taken for all time.  
O memory, live within me; with your hand  
Lay cooling touch upon my fevered brow  
And draw my spirit toward the hills of peace.  
\[ *Alone in the room, she bows her head within her  
   hands, and weeps* .\]  
  
                  CURTAIN
