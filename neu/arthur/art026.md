## MERLIN: A POEM

### by

## MELISSA \[pseudonym of Jane Brereton\]

  

Humbly Inscribed ( *Octob.* 1735.) to  
*Her* MAJESTY *QUEEN GUARDIAN* .

  
ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN !  
                                    The loyal Zeal excuse,  
The fond Ambition, of a *British Muse* ,  
Who wou'd, in *Merlin's* Praise, attempt to soar;  
And in his *Cave,* Your Patronage implore:  
Protection seek, beneath Your *Royal Name* ;  
And borrow Strength to rise, from *Merlin's* Fame.  
  
   When *Sol* to distant Climes had giv'n the Day,  
And shone on ours, with pale reflected Ray;  
When *Night* with solemn pace, advanc'd her Head,  
And o'er the Hemisphere her Mantle spread;  
Yet thro' the fable Gloom, those Orbs reveal'd,  
Which in a Flood of Light, the Day conceal'd:  
I, to a Summit, mus'd along, to see  
Unnumber'd *Suns* , which croud the *Galaxy.*  
But *Merlin's Cave* , had such Impressions made,  
And Royal Honours, to his Mem'ry pay'd;  
Pleas'd with Reflection, and involv'd in Thought;  
Creative *Fancy* , soon this *Vision* wrought.  
  
   Then, lo! beneath a venerable *Oak* ,  
Which oft repell'd the Tempest's furious stroke;  
Whose spreading Arms, a wide Circumf'rence show,  
And from whose Trunk, springs sacred *Misseltoe* :  
Methought, I saw an awful *Shade* arise;  
(Fit object only, for Poetick Eyes.)  
The Form Majestick, and the Front serene;  
*Angles* , and *Circles* , on his Robe were seen.  
The *Northern Crown* <sup>1</sup> , around his Temples shone,  
And the *Celestial Signs* adorn'd his Zone.  
The *British Harp* , seem'd to support one Hand;  
While t'other, gently wav'd the sacred *Wand.*  
The *Manes* of great *Merlin* stood confess'd;  
And my enraptur'd Fancy, thus address'd:  
  
   "Why will *Melissa* , *Merlin's* praise decline,  
"Distinguish'd now, by Royal CAROLINE ?  
"Believe not *such* , as wou'd asperse my Name;  
"But trust those *Authors* , who defend my Fame.  
"You, to the Royal *Grotto* , touch'd the Lyre,  
"And durst in God-like *Newton's* Praise aspire.  
"Why shou'd not *British Merlin* , grace thy Page,  
"In *Mathematicks* , once esteem'd a Sage?  
"A well-try'd *Genius* , cou'd transmit to Fame  
"My honour'd Modern *Cave* , and Ancient *Name* :  
"Might to my ROYAL GUEST , re-touch the String,  
And as *he* <sup>2</sup> sung the *Saint* , the *Prophet* sing.  
"But since the *Cambrian Bards* , neglect the Muse;  
" *Melissa's* humbler Strains, I'll not refuse.  
  
   "SIX Centuries, twice told, are now compleat,  
"Since *Merlin* liv'd on this terrestrial Seat.  
"Knowledge appear'd, but dawning to my Sight;  
"She blaz'd on *Newton* with Meridian Light.  
"Yet the faint Glimm'rings, which my *Genius* taught,  
"Beyond the ken, of human Art, were thought.  
"What I by meer mechanick Pow'rs atchiev'd,  
"Th' Effects of *Magick* , then, by most believ'd.  
"To *Stone-henge* , let the Sons of Art, repair,  
"And View the Wonders, I, erected There.  
"Try, if their Skill improv'd, Mine, e'er can foil;  
"Restore the *Giants-Dance* t' *Hibernian* Soil.  
"Nor in *Geometry* , excell'd alone;  
"But other *Sciences* to me were known.  
"I study'd *Nature* , through her various Ways;  
"And chaunted to this *Harp, prophetick* Lays.  
"To *Cader Ydris* <sup>3</sup> oft, I took my Way;  
"Rose with the *Sun* , toil'd up th' Ascent all Day;  
"But scarce could reach, the Mountains tow'ring height,  
"E'er Radiant *Vesper* , usher'd in the Night.  
"The Summit gain'd, I sought with naked Eye,  
"To penetrate, the Wonders of the Sky.  
"No Telescopic Glass known in that Age,  
"To assist the Optics of the curious Sage.  
"Though lov'd *Astronomy* oft charm'd my Mind,  
"I now erroneous, all my Notions fined.  
"I thought bright *Sol,* around our *Globe* had run;  
"Nor knew Earth's Motion, nor the central *Sun* .  
"And had I known; cou'd I Belief have gain'd,  
"When Ignorance, and Superstition reign'd?  
   'Unseen by me, *Attraction's* mighty Force,  
"And how fierce *Comets* , run their stated Course;  
"Surprizing Scenes! by Heav'n reserv'd in store,  
"For its own Fav'rite *Newton* , to explore.  
"With Faculties enlarg'd, *He* 's gone to prove  
"The Laws, and Motions of yon *Worlds* above;  
"And the vast Circuits of th'Expanse *survey,*  
"View *Solar Systems* in the *Milky Way* .  
"My Spirit too through Ether wings its Flight,  
"Discov'ring *Truths* , deny'd my mortal Sight.  
"Transported hovers, o'er my native Isle,  
"Where Arts improve, and Peace and Plenty smile.  
  
   "But lo! Boötes drives his radiant Car,  
"High on its Course, around the *Polar Star* ,  
"And fiery *Draco* , drops his starry Crest;  
"'Tis time, though shouldst indulge thy needful Rest.  
"Yet stay, *Melissa!* ---try this fav'rite Lyre;  
"And *Merlin* will the grateful Song inspire.  
"To *Learning'* s *Patroness* , my Thanks convey;  
"And humbly at her Feet, present thy Lay.  
"Conscious, how mean, and how unskill'd thy Hand,  
"I see thee tremble, at my kind Command.  
"Let my Persuasion, once, thy Fears beguile;  
"The gracious QUEEN , will condescend to smile.  
"For *Merlin* 's sake, will give *Melissa* leave,  
"To touch the Strings, in my much-honour'd *Cave* .  
   "And *Wallia* 's gen'rous Prince, will not disdain  
"What I foretell; ---tho' low, thy Lyrick Strain.
