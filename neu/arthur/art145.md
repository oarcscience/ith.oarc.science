## THE WAKING OF KING ARTHUR

### BRECHVA'S HARP-SONG

### by

## ERNEST RHYS

  
  
Little harp, at the cry  
   He shall come in his time;  
And thy sword-song on high,  
   High shall chime.  
  
Little harp, in his heart  
   Is the fire; in his hand  
Are the sword, and the Art,  
   To command.  
  
Little harp, like the wind  
   Is his strength; like thy sound  
Are his words, to unbind  
   Every wound.  
  
Little harp, if his name  
   Be unknown, ye shall hear  
How the Stars tell his fame  
   Far and near.  
  
Little harp, if unknown  
   He awake, there shall sing  
All the Stars, as they crown  
   Him All-King!
