## THE CHAPEL IN LYONESS

### by

## WILLIAM MORRIS

  

SIR OZANA LE CURE HARDY. SIR GALAHAD. SIR BORS DE GANYS.  
  
SIR OZANA.

  
All day long and every day,  
From Christmas-Eve to Whit-Sunday,  
Within that Chapel-aisle I lay,  
And no man came a-near.  
  
Naked to the waist was I,  
And deep within my breast did lie,  
Though no man any blood could spy,  
The truncheon of a spear.  
  
No meat did ever pass my lips  
Those days. Alas! the sunlight slips  
From off the gilded parclose, dips,  
And night comes on apace.  
  
My arms lay back behind my head;  
Over my raised-up knees was spread  
A samite cloth of white and red;  
A rose lay on my face.  
  
Many a time I tried to shout;  
But as in dream of battle-rout,  
My frozen speech would not well out;  
I could not even weep.  
  
With inward sigh I see the sun  
Fade off the pillars one by one,  
My heart faints when the day is done,  
Because I cannot sleep.  
  
Sometimes strange thoughts pass through my head;  
Not like a tomb is this my bed,  
Yet oft I think that I am dead;  
That round my tomb is writ,  
  
"Ozana of the hardy heart,  
Knight of the Table Round,  
Pray for his soul, lords, of your part;  
A true knight he was found."  
  
Ah! me, I cannot fathom it. \[ *He sleeps* .  
  

SIR GALAHAD.

  
All day long and every day,  
Till his madness pass'd away,  
I watch'd Ozana as he lay  
Within the gilded screen.  
  
All my singing moved him not;  
As I sung my heart grew hot,  
With the thought of Launcelot  
Far away, I ween.  
  
So I went a little space  
From out the chapel, bathed my face  
In the stream that runs apace  
By the churchyard wall.  
  
There I pluck'd a faint wild rose,  
Hard by where the linden grows,  
Sighing over silver rows  
Of the lilies tall.  
  
I laid the flower across his mouth;  
The sparkling drops seem'd good for drouth;  
He smiled, turn'd round towards the south,  
Held up a golden tress.  
  
The light smote on it from the west;  
He drew the covering from his breast,  
Against his heart that hair he prest;  
Death him soon will bless.  
  

SIR BORS.

  
I enter'd by the western door;  
I saw a knight's helm lying there:  
I raised my eyes from off the floor,  
And caught the gleaming of his hair.  
  
I stept full softly up to him;  
I laid my chin upon his head;  
I felt him smile; my eyes did swim,  
I was so glad he was not dead.  
  
I heard Ozana murmur low,  
"There comes no sleep nor any love."  
But Galahad stoop'd and kiss'd his brow:  
He shiver'd; I saw his pale lips move.  
  

SIR OZANA.

  
There comes no sleep nor any love;  
Ah me! I shiver with delight.  
I am so weak I cannot move;  
God move me to thee, dear, to-night!  
Christ help! I have but little wit:  
My life went wrong; I see it writ,  
  
"Ozana of the hardy heart,  
Knight of the Table Round,  
Pray for his soul, lords, on your part;  
A good knight he was found."  
  
Now I begin to fathom it. \[ *He dies* .  
  

SIR BORS.

  
Galahad sits dreamily;  
What strange things may his eyes see,  
Great blue eyes fix'd full on me?  
On his soul, Lord, have mercy.  
  

SIR GALAHAD.

  
Ozana, shall I pray for thee?  
Her cheek is laid to thine;  
No long time hence, also I see  
Thy wasted fingers twine  
  
Within the tresses of her hair  
That shineth gloriously,  
Thinly outspread in the clear air  
Against the jasper sea.
