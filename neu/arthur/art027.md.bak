## EXCALIBUR

### by

## SALLIE BRIDGES

  
  
For months it rested in the stone,  
          The sword Excalibur;  
The noblest knights of England's realm  
          Strove hard the steel to stir;  
For word had gone through all the land  
          That he who drew the blade  
Should fill the sovereign's empty throne,  
          The rightful king be made.  
  
The flower of island chivalry  
          Had come from far and near,  
To try their skill at tournament  
          The first day of the year.  
Mid the barons went Sir Ector,  
          His valiant son, Sir Kaye,  
And his foster-child, young Arthur,  
          Forth to the courtly fray.  
  
Unknown to all, dead Uther's son  
          Mix'd with the noble throng,  
Who dream'd not that to stripling page  
          Could crown and throne belong.  
"Now, grammercy," quoth Arthur,  
          In riding by Sir Kaye,  
"Good brother mine, how came you out  
          Without a sword to-day?"  
  
Sir Kaye look'd down, and paled to see  
          No weapon at his side:  
Then back his comrade spurr'd his steed,  
          Across the meadows wide,  
To where lay idle in its sheath  
          The knight's forgotten blade,  
But found that not a single squire  
          Had in the castle stay'd.  
  
Quoth Arthur then, with sudden wrath,  
           "From yonder mystic stone  
I'll pluck the sword, that good Sir Kaye  
          May wield it as his own!"  
So, lighting down from off his horse,  
          Towards the empty tent  
In which was kept Excalibur  
          His eager footsteps bent.  
  
In golden-letter'd hilt was bright,  
          Its knightly guards away;  
And so, with brave and fearless heart,  
          He made his bold essay.  
He grasp'd the handle in his hand,  
          Its point leap'd sharp and free.  
"My brother shall not go unarm'd  
          To battle now!" cried he.  
  
When old Sir Ector saw the blade  
          Flash in the morning light,  
He knew it was the Sword of Fate  
          That met his wondering sight,  
And ask'd of Arthur, "Whither came  
          The steel thou gavest Sir Kaye?"  
"I bore it," was the plain reply,  
           "From stone and tent away."  
  
"Then, by my faith," the gray knight swore,  
           "An' thou canst draw again  
The sword from out the selfsame place,  
          A monarch thou shalt reign!"  
And back within the marble stone  
          Prince Arthur thrust the blade,  
While long in vain to pluck it thence  
          Both high and low essay'd.  
  
"Come hither; strive again, my son!"  
          And quick on Ector's sight,  
In Arthur's hand, the marvellous steel  
          Was flashing keen and bright.  
Then kneel'd Sir Ector and Sir Kaye,  
          With every squire and lord,  
To greet as lawful king the youth  
          Who lean'd upon the Sword!  
  
Then spoke his aged foster-sire.  
           "Ye hail no child of mine!"  
But wist not buried Uther's heir  
          Was king by right divine.  
Thus Arthur through Excalibur  
          Received his father's crown;  
And ever through Excalibur  
          He kept his high renown!
