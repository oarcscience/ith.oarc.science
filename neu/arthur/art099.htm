J. LINTON</h2>  </center>  <br>  "Thou knewest nor fear nor faltering; thy life-vow<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of patriotic service thou didst well maintain:<br>  Therefore, though Death may hide thy valour now,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:When comes worst need thou shalt return again."<br>  <br>  So chaunted in low tones the fairy crew<br>  Of that dark barge whereon King Arthur lay,<br>  Drifting adown the misty river's flood,<br>  After his latest fight.  So chaunted they,<br>  Staunching his death-clefts; while he, sad of soul,<br>  Ponder'd Sir Lukyn's story wonder-fraught:<br>  How when Excalibar, at Arthur's hest<br>  Flung in the stream, had dipp'd toward the wave,<br>  A hand had risen, and grasp'd and borne it down.<br>  And thus King Arthur dream'd amid his wounds.<br>  <br>  "Excalibar, the charmed sword, returns<br>  Unto the hand that gave it,--sunk,--drawn in,--<br>  Nor left such ripple as an autumn leaf<br>  Reaching the water-marge on Evening's breath.<br>  So sinks my life after its turmoil'd years<br>  Without a trace:  blown from its branch of power,--<br>  And Time's dull stream flows o'er it heedlessly.<br>  It should not be so.  I have served the Gods;<br>  Kept myself pure; and stoutly grappled Hope,<br>  Till, firm-embraced, our pulses were but one.<br>  It is no braggart speech: yon gifted sword<br>  Had courage for its handle, and as straight<br>  My life was and close-hammer'd as the blade,--<br>  True steel that never struck an idle blow.<br>  Unto what end its stalwartness?  Defeat.<br>  Lo, I lie here.  The sword hath left no mark."<br>  <br>  "Thou shalt return again!" the Ladies sang;<br>  While the sore-hearted dream'd amid his wounds.<br>  <br>  "Year after year I strove, and through the fight<br>  Bore Hope upon my breast, as one would bear<br>  His beautiful bride; and when they slew her there<br>  I struggled on beneath her dearest form.<br>  O Hope!  belov&eacute;d, best-belov&eacute;d Hope!<br>  That brought my Country's ransom as thy dower;<br>  O Hope!  that I have cherish'd 'mid my griefs<br>  In long night-watches and through all the din<br>  Of battle-storm; ay! even when toil was curst,<br>  And knightliest endeavour by repulse<br>  Was driven away, like chaff swept from the floor;<br>  When field on field beheld me overthrown.<br>  Yet never conquer'd: witness Dawn and Eve,<br>  That ever found me rising from defeat<br>  As clomb the Sun from yesternight's red couch!<br>  Would I might battle yet!  Give way!  I will;<br>  And pile our foes upon the last free space<br>  Of British earth.  Why am I slumbering here,<br>  And my good sword not ready to my hand?<br>  <br>  "Year after year, and ever the same fierce strife<br>  Without remission.  I was as a pass<br>  Through which a host defiles with measured tramp:<br>  Squadron hard-following squadron till the earth<br>  Rejoices in the custom of sure steps.<br>  Let me be buried in the shallowest tomb,<br>  Beneath the march of heroes!  Death is nought,<br>  If I may be a stair to Victory.<br>  Where art thou?  Victory!--I am here, o'ercome."<br>  <br>  And shame, more deep than spear-thrusts, draining life,<br>  He lay entranced, nor heard the Fairies' song:--<br>  <br>  "Calmly the sun drops in its western grave,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seed beneath the glebe, and life to death;<br>  To-morrow comes in joy, ripe corn-fields wave,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever the heroic wears its wreath."<br>  <br>  "How have I fallen?  Has the fault been mine?<br>  I have not flinch'd from peril, nor counted pains;<br>  What adverse odds, what difficult steeps to climb,<br>  What possible inconvenience or mishap,<br>  Troubled me never.  I ask'd nought but this--<br>  May it serve thee?  my Country!  Welcome then.<br>  Self-care was but a feather in the scale,<br>  Or as a spark in one vast-soaring blaze--<br>  The fiery passionate wish to rescue thee.<br>  Thou wast my sacrificial altar; I<br>  A bridegroom offering.  Do I boast?  Ye Gods!<br>  The boaster has done nothing.  Lived and died.<br>  He boasts a failure.  Give him leave to say<br>  He fell as a king falleth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where again<br>  The Chorus swell'd around him, as a pulse<br>  Throbbing indignantly against reproach.<br>  "Thou knewest nor fear nor faltering!"--still they sang.<br>  "Ho!  who will follow Arthur to the war?<br>  Methought when once our banner was display'd<br>  The whole land should have risen as one man.<br>  Behold your duty--Forward at the foe--<br>  Had been enough.--The recreants!  Woe is me!<br>  They cavil'd at the standard-bearer's name;<br>  Doubted the leader could maintain his place;<br>  Others were worthier, might be 'mong themselves;<br>  'Twas an unlucky day to close with Doom;<br>  Yon covert safest was for skirmishers;<br>  Some little forethought till the rest came up;--<br>  And so sate down on cowardice, a soft couch,<br>  Where some would plan campaigns, as sluggards think<br>  In morning sleeps they put their armour on,<br>  And wake in bed.  But these would never wake:<br>  Rotting amid their reveries till the land<br>  Stank with the Cowards' Pestilence.  'Twas so--<br>  Brave Hearts that fought by me from first to last!<br>  That we were left to meet the invader's whelm:<br>  Wrong ever active, while before these homes<br>  Right humbly begg'd for alms some stealthy help<br>  In her sore want.  Even that was oft denied.<br>  False-lifed lip-servants!  pillow'd warriors!<br>  Whose crest should be a liar's cloven tongue,--<br>  You barter'd Freedom for a dunghill ease,<br>  And let the land of all our glorious sires<br>  Be trampled underneath the ruffian heel<br>  Of foreign tyranny.--My soul is drear.<br>  <br>  "Do I forget you?  Arthur's trusty peers!<br>  Proud comrades, lovely in your noble strength:<br>  My Knights, my Royal Ones!  whose words were deeds,<br>  Whose deeds were hymns of triumph.  Let me die,<br>  Since you are fallen.  Have the Powers betray'd <br>  Your promise?  Worth is worthless.  Life itself<br>  Is falsehood.--It may be the Powers are weak,<br>  Since Valour wins not.  Is their own abode<br>  Invaded by the Evil of our days?--<br>  I am a king, and I may dare to ask.--<br>  Are even the Gods grown false and dastardly?<br>  I hear the smooth lush whispering of the stream,<br>  And, blending with it, words as dreamy smooth.<br>  What forms are these that hang above my bier?<br>  Where do they carry me, throughout this night?--<br>  Defeat, and death, and all before me dark."<br>  <br>  But the white garments glimmer'd in his sight<br>  For all the darkness,--like the first of dawn<br>  To one lone-watching on some weary height;<br>  And on the sweet chaunt slid through his barren griefs<br>  Like softest rain in fields long parch'd with drought.<br>  Ever the Fairies sang, as glode the barge.<br>  <br>  "Thou knewest nor fear nor faltering.  Thy sure life<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been an act devout, whose worth shall chain<br>  The future to thy purpose.  When the strife<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath reach'd its height thou shalt return again."<br>  <br>  And one clear voice--whose echoes leap'd to shore<br>  And stirr'd the dead upon the battle-ground--<br>  Sang yet again:  the King forgot his wounds.<br>  <br>  "Thy true adventure was a living seed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest of the Eternal can not fail:<br>  Thy spirit shall return, at their worst need<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help whom now thy arm may not avail."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------<br>  <br>  It is a fable of the meed of Truth:<br>  Most knight-like Truth, that, scorning sloth or fear,<br>  Hastens to meet the Evils of the time;<br>  And, be he ne'er so poorly companied,<br>  Dares all their force, copes with their fiercest tides,<br>  Defies disaster and despair itself,<br>  And leaves upon the sorriest place of death--<br>  Where hopes are scatter'd like autumnal wrecks--<br>  A memory that shall live and bring his name<br>  In fire to the hearts of new endeavourers,--<br>  Leading them from the gloomiest depth of care,<br>  Even when their need shall be most desperate,<br>  With power as if his Angel had return'd<br>  To avenge the past defeat with victory.<br>  <br>  True-soul'd and valiant!  Arthur!  come again.<br>  Is not our need enough?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What voice replies?<br>
