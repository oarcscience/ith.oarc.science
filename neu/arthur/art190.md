## ON KING ARTHUR'S ROUND-TABLE AT WINCHESTER

### by

## THOMAS WARTON

  
  
  
Where Venta's Norman castle still uprears  
Its rafter'd hall, that o'er the grassy foss,  
And scatter'd flinty fragments, clad in moss,  
On yonder steep in naked state appears;  
High hung remains, the pride of warlike years,  
Old Arthur's Board: on the capacious round  
Some British pen has sketch'd the names renown'd,  
In marks obscure, of his immortal peers.  
Though join'd by magic skill, with many a rime,  
The Druid frame, unhonour'd, falls a prey  
To the slow vengeance of the wisard Time,  
And fade the British characters away;  
Yet Spenser's page, that chants in verse sublime  
Those Chiefs, shall live, unconscious of decay.
