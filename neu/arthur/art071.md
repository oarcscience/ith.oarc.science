## THE TRAGEDY OF TRAGEDIES

### by

## HENRY FIELDING

  
  

*H. Scriblerus Secundus;*  
  
HIS  
  
**PREFACE**

  
  
The Town hath seldom been more divided in its Opinion, than concerning
the Merit of the following Scenes. Whilst some publickly affirmed, That
no Author could produce so fine a Piece but Mr. *P* ------, others have
with as much Vehemence insistsed, That no one could write any thing so
bad, but Mr. *F* ------.  
    Nor can we wonder at this Dissention about its Merit, when the
learned World have not unanimously decided even the very Nature of this
Tragedy. For tho' most of the Universities in *Europe* have honoured it
with the Name of *Egregium & maximi pretii opus, Tragaediis tam antiquis
quam novis longe anteponendum;* nay, Dr. *B* ------ hath pronounced,
*Citiùs Maevii AEneadem quam Scribleri istius Tragaediam hanc
crediderim, cujus Autorem Senecam ipsum tradidisse haud dubitârim* ; and
the great Professor *Burman* , hath stiled *Tom Thumb, Heroum omnium
Tragicorum facilè Principem* . Nay, tho' it hath, among other Languages,
been translated into *Dutch* , and celebrated with great Applause at
*Amsterdam* (where Burlesque never came) by the Title of *Mynheer Vander
Thumb* , the Burgomasters receiving it with that reverent and silent
Attention, which becometh an Audience at a deep Tragedy: Notwithstanding
all this, there have not been wanting some who have represented these
Scenes in a ludicrous Light; and Mr. *D* ------ hath been heard to say,
with some Concern, That he wondered a Tragical and Christian Nation
would permit a Representation on its Theatre, so visibly designed to
ridicule and extirpate every thing that is Great and Solemn among us.  
    This learned Critick, and his Followers, were led into so great an
Error, by that surreptitious and piratical Copy which stole last Year
into the World; with what Injustice and Prejudice to our Author, I hope
will be acknowledged by every one who shall happily peruse this genuine
and original Copy. Nor can I help remarking, to the great Praise of our
Author, that, however imperfect the former was, still did even that
faint Resemblance of the true *Tom Thumb* , contain sufficient Beauties
to give it a Run of upwards of Forty Nights, to the politest Audiences.
But, nothwithstanding that Applause which it receiv'd from all the best
Judges, it was as severely censured by some few bad ones, and I believe,
rather maliciously than ignorantly, reported to have been intended a
Burlesque on the loftiest Parts of Tragedy, and designed to banish what
we generally call Fine Things, from the Stage.  
    Now, if I can set my Country right in an Affair of this Importance,
I shall lightly esteem any Labour which it may cost. And this I the
rather undertake, First, as it is indeed in some measure incumbent on me
to vindicate myself from that surreptitious Copy before-mentioned,
published by some ill-meaning People, under my Name: Secondly, as
knowing my self more capable of doing Justice to our Author, than any
other Man, as I have given my self more Pains to arrive at a thorough
Understanding of this little Piece, having for ten Years together read
nothing else; in which time, I think I may modestly presume, with the
help of my English Dictionary, to comprehend all the Meanings of every
Word in it.  
    But should any Error of my Pen awaken *Clariss. Bentleium* to
enlighten the World with his Annotations on our Author, I shall not
think that the least Reward or Happiness arising to me from these my
Endeavours.  
    I shall wave at present, what hath caused such Feuds in the learned
World, Whether this Piece was originally written by *Shakespear* , tho'
certainly That, were it true, must add a considerable Share to its
Merit; especially, with such who are so generous as to buy and to
commend what they never read, from an implicit Faith in the Author only:
A Faith! which our Age abounds in as much, as it can be called deficient
in any other.  
    Let it suffice, that the *Tragedy of Tragedies* , or, *The Life and
Death of Tom Thumb* , was written in the Reign of Queen *Elizabeth* .
Nor can the Objection made by Mr. *D* ------, That the Tragedy must then
have been antecedent to the History, have any Weight, when we consider,
That tho' the *History of Tom Thumb* , printed by and for *Edward
M------r* , at the Looking-Glass on *London-Bridge* , be of a later
Date; still must we suppose this History to have been transcribed from
some other, unless we suppose the Writer thereof to be inspired: A Gift
very faintly contended for by the Writers of our Age. As to this
History's not bearing the Stamp of Second, Third, or Fourth Edition, I
see but little in that Objection; Editions being very uncertain Lights
to judge of Books by: And perhaps Mr. *M------r* may have joined twenty
Editions in one, as Mr. *C------l* hath ere now divided one into
twenty.  
    Nor doth the other Argument, drawn from the little Care our Author
hath taken to keep up to the letter of the History, carry any greater
Force. Are there not Instances of Plays, wherein the History is so
perverted, that we can know the Heroes whom they celebrate by no other
Marks than their Names? Nay, do we not find the same Character placed by
different Poets in such different Lights, that we can discover not the
least Sameness, or even Likeness in the Features? The *Sophonisba* of
*Mairet* , and of *Lee* , is a tender, passionate, amorous Mistress of
*Massinissa; Corneille* , and Mr. *Thomson* give her no other Passion
but the Love of her Country, and make her as cool in her Affection to
*Massinissa* , as to *Syphax* . In the two latter, she resembles the
Character of Queen *Elizabeth* ; in the two former she is the Picture of
*Mary* Queen of *Scotland* . In short, the one *Sophonisba* is as
different from the other, as the *Brutus* of *Voltaire* , is from the
*Marius* Jun. of *Otway* ; or as the *Minerva* is from the *Venus* of
the Ancients.  
    Let us now proceed to a regular Examinatoin of the Tragedy before
us, in which I shall treat separately of the Fable, the Moral, the
Characters, the Sentiments, and the Diction. And first of the  
     *Fable* ; which I take to be the most simple imaginable; and, to
use the Words of an eminent Author, 'One, regular, and uniform, not
'charged with a Multiplicity of Incidents, and yet affording several
'Revolutions of Fortune; by which the Passions may be excited, 'varied,
and driven to their full Tumult of Emotion.' -- Nor is the *Action* of
this Tragedy less great than uniform. The Spring of all, is the Love of
*Tom Thumb* for *Huncamunca* ; which causeth the Quarrel between their
Majesties in the first Act; the Passion of Lord *Grizzle* in the Second;
the Rebellion, Fall of Lord *Grizzle* , and *Glumdalca* , Devouring of
*Tom Thumb* by the Cow, and that bloody Catastrophe, in the Third.  
    Nor is the *Moral* of this excellent Tragedy less noble than the
*Fable* ; it teaches these two instructive Lessons, *viz* . That Human
Happiness is exceeding transient, and, That Death is the certain End of
all Men; the former whereof is inculcated by the fatal End of *Tom
Thumb* ; the latter, by that of all the other Personages.  
    The *Characters* are, I think, sufficeintly described in the
*Dramatis Personae* ; and I believe we shall find few Plays, where
greater care is taken to maintain them throughout, and to preserve in
every Speech that Characteristical Mark which distinguishes them from
each other. 'But (says Mr. *D* ------) how well doth the *Character* of
' *Tom Thumb* , whom we must call the Hero of this Tragedy, if it hath
'any Hero, agree with the Precepts of *Aristotle* , who defineth
*Tragedy 'to be the Imitation of a short, but perfect Action, containing
a just 'Greatness in itself* , &c. What Greatness can be in a Fellow,
whom History 'relateth to have been no higher than a Span?' This
Gentleman seemeth to think, with Serjeant *Kite* , that the Greatness of
a Man's Soul is in proportion to that of his Body, the contrary of which
is affirmed by our *English* Physognominical Writers. Besides, if I
understand *Aristotle* right, he speaketh only of the Greatness of the
Action, and not of the Person.  
    As for the *Sentiments* and the *Diction* , which now only remain to
be spoken to; I thought I could afford them no stronger Justification,
than by producing parallel Passages out of the best of our *English*
Writers. Whether this Sameness of Thought and Expression which I have
quoted from them, proceeded from an Agreement in their Way of Thinking;
or whether they have borrowed from our Author, I leave the Reader to
determine. I shall adventure to affirm this of the Sentiments of our
Author; That they are generally the most familiar which I have ever met
with, and at the same time delivered with the highest Dignity of Phrase;
which brings me to speak of his *Diction* . -- Here I shall only beg one
Postulatum, *viz* . That the greatest Perfection of the Language of a
Tragedy is, that it is not to be understood; which granted (as I think
it must be) it will necessarily follow, that the only ways to avoid
this, is by being too high or too low for the Understanding, which will
comprehend every thing within its Reach. Those two extremities of Stile
Mr. *Dryden* illustrates by the familiar Image of two Inns, which I
shall term the Aerial and the Subterrestrial.  
     *Horace* goeth farther, and sheweth when it is proper to call at
one of these Inns, and when at the other;  
     *Telephus & Peleus, cùm pauper & exul uterque,  
    Projicit Ampullas & Sesquipedalia Verba* .  
That he approveth of the *Sesquipedalia Verba* , is plain; for had not
*Telephus & Peleus* used this sort of Diction in Prosperity, they could
not have dropt it in Adversity. The Aerial Inn, therefore (says *Horace*
) is proper only to be frequented by Princes and other great Men, in the
highest Affluence of Fortune; the Subterrestrial is appointed for the
Entertainment of the poorer sort of People only, whom *Horace*
advises,  
  
    ---- *dolere Sermone pedestri* .  
  
The true Meaning of both which Citations is, That Bombast is the proper
Language for Joy, and Doggrel for Grief, the latter of which is
literally imply'd in the *Sermo pedestris* , as the former is in the
*Sesquipedalia Verba* .  
     *Cicero* recommendeth the former of these. *Quid est tam furiosum
vel tragicum quàm verborum sonitus inanis, nullâ subjectâ Sententiâ
neque Scientiâ* . What can be so proper for Tragedy as a Set of big
sounding Words, so contrived together, as to convey no Meaning; which I
shall one Day or other prove to be the Sublime of *Longinus. Ovid*
declareth absolutely for the latter Inn:  
*Omne genus scripti Gravitate Tragaedia vincit* .  
Tragedy hath of all Writings the greatest Share in the *Bathos* , which
is the Profound of *Scriblerus* .  
    I shall not presume to determine which of these two Stiles be
properer for Tragedy. -- It sufficeth, that our Author excelleth in
both. He is very rarely within sight through the whole Play, either
rising higher than the Eye of your Understanding can soar, or sinking
lower than it careth to stoop. But here it may perhaps be observed, that
I have given more frequent Instances of Authors who have imitated him in
the Sublime, than in the contrary. To which I answer, First, Bombast
being properly a Redundancy of Genius, Instances of Nature occur in
Poets whose Names do more Honour to our Author, than the Writers in the
Doggerel, which proceeds from a cool, calm, weighty Way of Thinking.
Instances whereof are most frequently to be found in Authors of a lower
Class. Secondly, That the Works of such Authors are difficultly found at
all. Thirdly, That it is a very hard Task to read them, in order to
extrat these Flowers from them. And Lastly, It is very often difficult
to transplant them at all; they being like some Flowers of a very nice
Nature, which will flourish in no Soil but their own: For it is easy to
transcribe a Thought, but not the Want of one. The *Earl of Essex* , for
Instance, is a little Garden of choice Rarities, whence you can scarce
transplant one Line so as to perserve its original Beauty. This must
account to the Reader for his missing the Names of several of his
Acquaintance, which he had certainly found here, had I ever read their
Works; for which, if I have not a just Esteem, I can at least say with
*Cicero, Quae non contemno, quippè quae nunquam legerim* . However, that
the Reader may meet with due Satisfaction in this Point, I have a young
Commentator from the University, who is reading over all the modern
Tragedies, at Five Shillings a Dozen, and collecting all that they have
stole from our Author, which shall shortly be added as an Appendix to
this Work.

        SCENE *the Court of King* Arthur, *and a Plain thereabouts* .  
  
  
  

ACT I  
  
SCENE I  
  
SCENE, *The Palace* .  
DOODLE, NOODLE.

  
DOODLE. Sure, such a 1 Day as this was never seen!  
    The Sun himself, on this auspicious Day,  
    Shines, like a Beau in a new Birth-Day Suit:  
    This down the Seams embroider'd, that the Beams.  
    All Nature wears one universal Grin.  
NOODLE. This Day, O Mr. *Doodle* , is a Day  
    Indeed, 2 a Day we never saw before.  
    The mighty 3 *Thomas Thumb* victorious comes;  
    Millions of Giants crowd his Chariot Wheels,  
    4 Giants! to whom the Giants in *Guild-hall*  
    Are Infant Dwarfs. They frown, and foam, and roar,  
    While *Thumb* regardless of their Noise rides on.  
    So some Cock-Sparrow in a Farmer's Yard,  
    Hops at the Head of an huge Flock of Turkeys.  
DOODLE. When Goody *Thumb* first brought this *Thomas* forth,  
    The *Genius* of our Land triumphant reign'd;  
    Then, then, Oh *Arthur* ! did thy *Genius* reign.  
NOODLE. They tell me it is 5 whisper'd in the Books  
    Of all our Sages, that this mighty Hero  
    By *Merlin's* Art begot, hath not a Bone  
    Within his Skin, but is a Lump of Gristle.  
DOODLE. Then 'tis a Gristle of no mortal kind,  
    Some God, my *Noodle* , stept into the Place  
    Of Gaffer *Thumb* , and more than 6 half begot,  
    This mightly *Tom* .  
NOODLE. --7 Sure he was sent Express  
    From Heav'n, to be the Pillar of our State.  
    Tho' small his Body be, so very small,  
    A Chairman's Leg is more than twice as large;  
    Yet is his Soul like any Mountain big,  
    And as a Mountain once brought forth a Mouse,  
    8 So doth this Mouse contain a mighty Mountain.  
DOODLE. Mountain indeed! So terrible his Name,  
    9 The Giant Nurses frighten Children with it;  
    And cry *Tom Thumb* is come, and if you are  
    Naughty, will surely take the Child away.  
NOODLE. But hark! 10 these Trumpets speak the King's Approach.  
DOODLE. He comes most luckily for my Petition.  
  
                                                                     
                                          *Flourish*  
  
  

SCENE II  
  
KING, QUEEN, GRIZZLE, NOODLE, DOODLE, FOODLE.

  
KING. 11 Let nothing but a Face of Joy appear;  
    The man who frowns this Day shall lose his Head,  
    That he may have no Face to frown withal.  
    Smile, *Dollalolla,* -- Ha! what wrinkled Sorrow,  
    12 Hangs, sits, lies, frowns upon thy knitted Brow?  
    Whence flow those Tears fast down thy blubber'd Cheeks,  
    Like a swoln Gutter, gushing through the Streets?  
QUEEN. 13 Excess of Joy, my Lord, I've heard Folks say,  
    Gives Tears as certain as Excess of Grief.  
KING. If it be so, let all Men cry for Joy,  
    14 'Till my whole Court be drowned with their Tears;  
    Nay, till they overflow my utmost Land,  
    And leave me Nothing but the Sea to rule.  
DOODLE. My Liege, I a Petition have here got.  
KING. Petition me no Petitions, Sir, to-day;  
    Let other Hours be set apart for Business.  
    To-day it is our pleasure to be 15 drunk,  
    And this our Queen shall be as drunk as We.  
QUEEN. (Tho' I already 16 half Seas over am)  
    If the capacious Goblet overflow  
    With *Arrack-Punch* -- 'fore *George* ! I'll see it out;  
    Of *Rum* , and *Brandy* , I'll not taste a Drop.  
KING. Tho' *Rack* , in *Punch* , Eight Shillings be a Quart,  
    And *Rum* and *Brandy* be no more than Six,  
    Rather than quarrel, you shall have your Will.  
  
                                                                     
                                          *Trumpets* .  
  
    But, ha! the Warrior comes; the Great *Tom Thumb* ;  
    The little Hero, Giant-killing Boy,  
    Preserver of my Kingdom, is arrived.  
  
  

SCENE III  
  
TOM THUMB, *to them with Officers, Prisoners, and Attendants* .

  
KING. 17 Oh! welcome most, most welcome to my Arms,  
    What Gratitude can thank away the Debt,  
    Your Valour lays upon me?  
QUEEN. \[Aside.\] -- 18 Oh! ye Gods!  
TOM THUMB. When I'm not thank'd at all, I'm thank'd enough,  
    19 I've done my Duty, and I've done no more.  
QUEEN. \[Aside\] Was ever such a Godlike Creature seen!  
KING. Thy Modesty's a 20 Candle to thy Merit,  
    It shines itself, and shews thy Merit too.  
    But say, my Boy, where did'st thou leave the Giants?  
TOM THUMB. My Liege, without the Castle Gates they stand,  
    The Castle Gates too low for their Admittance.  
KING. What look they like?  
TOM THUMB. Like Nothing but Themselves.  
QUEEN. 21 And sure thou art like nothing but thy Self.  
KING. \[Aside.\] Enough! the vast Idea fills my Soul.  
    I see them, yes, I see them now before me:  
    The monst'rous, ugly, barb'rous Sons of Whores.  
    But, Ha! what Form Majestick strikes our Eyes?  
    22 So perfect, that it seems to have been drawn  
    By all the Gods in Council: So fair she is,  
    That surely at her Birth the Council paus'd,  
    And then at length cry'd out, This is a Woman!  
TOM THUMB. Then were the Gods mistaken. -- She is not  
    A Woman, but a Giantess -- whom we  
    23 With much ado, have made a shift to hawl  
    Within the Town: 24 for she is by a Foot,  
    Shorter than all her Subject Giants were.  
GLUMDALCA. We yesterday were both a Queen and Wife,  
    One hundred thousand Giants own'd our Sway,  
    Twenty whereof were married to our self.  
QUEEN. Oh! happy State of Giantism -- where Husbands  
    Like Mushrooms grow, whilst hapless we are forc'd  
    To be content, nay, happy thought with one.  
GLUMDALCA. But then to lose them all in one black Day,  
    That the same Sun, which rising, saw me wife  
    To Twenty Giants, setting, should behold  
    Me widow'd of them all. -- 25 My worn out Heart,  
    That Ship, leaks fast, and the great heavy Lading,  
    My Soul, will quickly sink.  
QUEEN. -- Madam, believe,  
    I view your Sorrows with a Woman's Eye;  
    But learn to bear them with what Strength you may,  
    To-morrow we will have our Grenadiers  
    Drawn out before you, and you then shall choose  
    What Husbands you think fit.  
GLUMDALCA. -- 26 Madam, I am  
    Your most obedient, and most humble Servant.  
KING. Think, mighty Princess, think this Court your own,  
    Nor think the Landlord me, this House my Inn;  
    Call for whate'er you will, you'll Nothing pay.  
    27 I feel a sudden Pain within my Breast,  
    Nor know I whether it arise from Love,  
    Or only the Wind-Cholick. Time must shew.  
    Oh *Thumb* ! What do we to thy Valour owe?  
    Ask some Reward, great as we can bestow.  
TOM THUMB. 28 I ask not Kingdoms, I can conquer those,  
    I ask not Money, Money I've enough;  
    For what I've done, and what I mean to do,  
    For Giants slain, and Giants yet unborn,  
    Which I will slay -- if this be call'd a Debt,  
    Take my Receipt in full -- I ask but this,  
    29 To Sun my self in *Huncamunca's* Eyes.  
KING. Prodigious bold Request.  
QUEEN. \[Aside.\] -- 30 Be still my Soul.  
TOM THUMB. 31 My heart is at the Threshold of your Mouth,  
    And waits its answer there -- Oh! do not frown,  
    I've try'd, to Reason's Tune, to tune my Soul,  
    But Love did overwind and crack the String.  
    Tho' *Jove* in Thunder had cry'd out, YOU SHAN'T,  
    I should have love'd her still -- for oh strange fate,  
    Then when I lov'd her least, I lov'd her most.  
KING. It is resolv'd -- the Princess is your own.  
TOM THUMB. 32 Oh! happy, happy, happy, happy, *Thumb* !  
QUEEN. Consider, Sir, reward your Soldiers Merit,  
    But give not *Huncamunca* to *Tom Thumb* .  
KING. *Tom Thumb* ! Odzooks, my wide extended Realm  
    Knows not a Name so glorious as *Tom Thumb* .  
    Let *Macedonia, Alexander* boast,  
    Let *Rome* her *Caesar's* and her *Scipio's* show,  
    Her Messieurs *France* , let *Holland* boast *Mynheers* ,  
     *Ireland* her O's, her *Mac's* let *Scotland* boast,  
    Let *England* boast no other than *Tom Thumb* .  
QUEEN. Tho' greater yet his boasted Merit was,  
    He shall not have my Daughter, that is Pos'.  
KING. Ha! sayst thou *Dollalolla* ?  
QUEEN. -- I say he shan't.  
KING. 33 Then by our Royal Self we swear you lye.  
QUEEN. 34 Who but a Dog, who but a Dog,  
    Would use me as thou dost? Me, who have lain  
    35 These twenty Years so loving by thy Side.  
    But I will be reveng'd. I'll hang my self,  
    Then tremble all who did this Match persuade,  
    36 For riding on a Cat, from high I'll fall,  
    And squirt down Royal Vengeance on you all.  
FOODLE. 37 Her Majesty the Queen is in a Passion.  
KING. 38 Be she, or be she not -- I'll to the Girl  
    And pave thy Way, oh *Thumb* -- Now, by our self,  
    We were indeed a pretty King of Clouts,  
    To truckle to her Will -- For when by Force  
    Or Art the Wife her Husband over-reaches,  
    Give him the Peticoat, and her the Breeches.  
TOM THUMB. 39 Whisper, ye Winds, that *Huncamunca's* mine;  
    Echoes repeat, that *Huncamunca's* mine!  
    The dreadful Bus'ness of the War is o'er,  
    And Beauty, heav'nly Beauty! crowns my Toils,  
    I've thrown the bloody Garment now aside,  
    And *Hymeneal* Sweets invite my Bride.  
        So when some Chimney-Sweeper, all the Day,  
    Hath through dark Paths pursu'd the sooty Way,  
    At Night, to wash his Hands and Face he flies,  
    And in his t'other Shirt with his *Brickdusta* lies.  
  
  

SCENE IV  
  
GRIZZLE *solus* .

  
GRIZZLE. 40 Where art thou *Grizzle* ? where are now thy Glories?  
    Where are the Drums that waken'd thee to Honour?  
    Greatness is a lac'd Coat from *Monmouth-Street* ,  
    Which Fortune lends us for a Day to wear,  
    To-morrow puts it on another's Back.  
    The spiteful Sun but yesterday survey'd.  
    His Rival, high as Saint *Paul's* Cupola;  
    Now may he see me as *Fleet-Ditch* laid low.  
  
  

SCENE V  
  
QUEEN, GRIZZLE.

  
QUEEN. 41 Teach me to scold, prodigious-minded *Grizzle* .  
    Mountain of Treason, ugly as the Devil,  
    Teach this confounded hateful Mouth of mine,  
    To spout forth Words malicious as thy self,  
    Words, which might shame all *Billingsgate* to speak.  
GRIZZLE. Far be it from my Pride, to think my Tongue  
    Your Royal Lips can in that Art instruct,  
    Wherein you so excel. But may I ask,  
    Without Offence, wherefore my Queen would scold?  
QUEEN. Wherefore, Oh! Blood and Thunder! han't you heard  
    (What ev'ry Corner of the Court resounds)  
    That little *Thumb* will be a great Man made.  
GRIZZLE. I heard it, I confess -- for who, alas!  
    42 Can always stop his Ears -- but wou'd my Teeth,  
    By grinding Knives, had first been set on Edge.  
QUEEN. Would I had heard at the still Noon of Night,  
    The Hallaloo of Fire in every Street!  
    Odsbobs! I have a mind to hang my self,  
    To think I shou'd a Grandmother be made,  
    By such a Raskal. -- Sure the King forgets,  
    When in a Pudding, by his Mother put,  
    The Bastard, by a Tinker, on a Stile  
    Was drop'd. -- O, good Lord *Grizzle* ! can I bear  
    To see him from a Pudding, mount the Throne?  
    Or can, Oh can! my *Huncamunca* bear,  
    To take a Pudding's Offspring to her Arms?  
GRIZZLE. Oh Horror! Horror! Horror! cease my Queen,  
    43 Thy Voice like twenty Screech-Owls, wracks my Brain.  
QUEEN. Then rouse thy Spirit -- we may yet prevent  
    This hated Match. --  
GRIZZLE. -- We will; 44 not Fate it self,  
    Should it conspire with *Thomas Thumb* , should cause it.  
    I'll swim through Seas; I'll ride upon the Clouds;  
    I'll dig the Earth; I'll blow out ev'ry Fire;  
    I'll rave; I'll rant; I'll rise; I'll rush; I'll roar;  
    Fierce as the Man whom 45 smiling Dolphins bore,  
    From the Prosaick to Poetick Shore.  
    I'll tear the Scoundrel into twenty Pieces.  
QUEEN. Oh, no! prevent the Match, but hurt him not;  
    For tho' I would not have him have my Daughter,  
    Yet can we kill the Man that kill'd the Giants?  
GRIZZLE. I tell you, Madam, it was all a Trick,  
    He made the Giants first, and then he kill'd them;  
    As Fox-hunters bring Foxes to the Wood,  
    And then with Hounds they drive them out again.  
QUEEN. How! have you seen no Giants? Are there not  
    Now, in the Yard, ten thousand proper Giants?  
GRIZZLE. 46 Indeed, I cannot positively tell,  
    But firmly do believe there is not One.  
QUEEN. Hence! from my Sight! thou Traitor, hie away;  
    By all my Stars! thou enviest *Tom Thumb* .  
    Go, Sirrah! go, 47 hie away! hie! -- thou art  
    A setting Dog, be gone.  
GRIZZLE. Madam, I go.  
     *Tom Thumb* shall feel the Vengeance you have rais'd:  
    So, when two Dogs are fighting in the Streets,  
    With a third Dog, one of the two Dogs meets,  
    With angry Teeth, he bites him to the Bone,  
    And this Dog smarts for what the Dog had done.  
  
  
  

SCENE VI.  
  
QUEEN *sola* .

  
QUEEN. And whither shall I go? -- Alack-a-day!  
    I love *Tom Thumb* -- but must not tell him so;  
    For what's a Woman, when her Virtue's gone?  
    A Coat without its Lace; Wig out of Buckle;  
    A Stocking with a Hole in't -- I can't live  
    Without my Virtue, or without *Tom Thumb* .  
    48 Then let me weigh them in two equal Scales,  
    In this Scale put my Virtue, that, *Tom Thumb* .  
    Alas! *Tom Thumb* is heavier than my Virtue.  
    But hold! -- perhaps I may be left a Widow:  
    This Match prevented, then *Tom Thumb* is mine:  
    In that dear Hope, I will forget my Pain.  
        So, when some Wench to *Tothill-Bridewell's* sent,  
    With beating Hemp, and Flogging she's content:  
    She hopes in time to ease her present Pain,  
    At length is free, and walks the Streets again.  
  

THE END OF THE FIRST ACT  
  
  
  
ACT II  
  
SCENE I  
  
SCENE, *The Street* .  
BAILIFF, FOLLOWER.

  
BAILIFF. Come on, my trusty Follower, come on,  
    This Day discharge thy Duty, and at Night  
    A Double Mug of Beer, and Beer shall glad thee.  
    Stand here by me, this Way must *Noodle* pass.  
FOLLOWER. No more, no more, Oh Bailiff! every Word  
    Inspires my Soul with Virtue. -- Oh! I long  
    To meet the Enemy in the Street -- and nab him;  
    To lay arresting Hands upon his Back,  
    And drag him trembling to the Spunging-House.  
BAILIFF. There, when I have him, I will spunge upon him.  
    49 Oh! glorious Thought! by the Sun, Moon, and Stars,  
    I will enjoy it, tho it be in Thought!  
    Yes, yes, my Follower, I will enjoy it.  
FOLLOWER. Enjoy it then some other time, for now  
    Our Prey approaches.  
BAILIFF. Let us retire.  
  
  

SCENE II.  
  
TOM THUMB, NOODLE, BAILIFF, FOLLOWER.

  
TOM THUMB. Trust me my *Noodle* , I am wondrous sick;  
    For tho' I love the gentle *Huncamunca* ,  
    Yet at the Thought of Marriage, I grow pale;  
    For oh! -- 50 but swear thoul't keep it ever secret,  
    I will unfold a Tale will make thee stare.  
NOODLE. I swear by lovely *Huncamunca's* Charms.  
TOM THUMB. Then know -- 51 my Grand-mamma hath often said,  
     *Tom Thumb* , beware of Marriage.  
NOODLE. Sir, I blush  
    To think a Warrior great in Arms as you,  
    Should be affrighted by his Grand-mamma;  
    Can an old woman's empty Dreams deter  
    The blooming Hero from the Virgin's Arms?  
    Think of the Joy that will your Soul alarm,  
    When in her fond Embraces clasp'd you lie,  
    While on her panting Breast dissolv'd in Bliss,  
    You pour out all *Tom Thumb* in every Kiss.  
TOM THUMB. Oh! *Noodle* , thou hast fir'd my eager Soul;  
    Spight of my Grandmother, she shall be mine;  
    I'll hug, caress, I'll eat her up with Love.  
    Whole Days, and Nights, and Years shall be too short  
    For our Enjoyment, every Sun shall rise  
    52 Blushing, to see us in our Bed together.  
NOODLE. Oh Sir! this Purpose of your Soul pursue.  
BAILIFF. Oh, Sir! I have an Action against you.  
NOODLE. At whose Suit is it?  
BAILIFF. At your Taylor's, Sir.  
    Your Taylor put this Warrant in my Hands,  
    And I arrest you, Sir, at his Commands.  
TOM THUMB. Ha! Dogs! Arrest my Friend before my Face!  
    Think you *Tom Thumb* will suffer this Disgrace!  
    But let vain Cowards threaten by their Word,  
     *Tom Thumb* shall shew his Anger by his Sword.  
  
                                                                     
              *Kills the* BAILIFF and his FOLLOWER.  
  
BAILIFF. Oh, I am slain!  
FOLLOWER. I am murthered also,  
    And to the Shades, the dismal Shades below,  
    My Bailiff's faithful Follower I go.  
NOODLE. 53 Go then to Hell, like Rascals as you are,  
    And give our Service to the Bailiffs there.  
TOM THUMB. Thus perish all the Bailiffs in the Land,  
    Till Debtors at Noon-Day shall walk the streets,  
    And no one fear a Bailiff or his Writ.  
  
  

SCENE III.  
  
*The Princess* Huncamunca's *Apartment* .  
HUNCAMUNCA, CLEORA, MUSTACHA.

  
HUNCAMUNCA. 54 Give me some Musick -- see that it be sad.  
CLEORA *sings* .  
               Cupid, *ease a Love-sick Maid,  
               Bring thy Quiver to her Aid;  
               With equal Ardor wound the Swain:  
               Beauty should never sigh in vain.*  
  
                                           II.  
  
               *Let him feel the pleasing Smart,  
               Drive thy Arrow thro' his Heart;  
               When One you wound, you then destroy;  
               When Both you kill, you kill with Joy* .  
HUNCAMUNCA. 55 O, *Tom Thumb* ! *Tom Thumb* ! wherefore art thou *Tom
Thumb* ?  
    Why had'st thou not been born of Royal Race?  
    Why had not mighty *Bantam* been thy Father?  
    Or else the King of *Brentford, Old* or *New* ?  
MUSTACHA. I am surpriz'd that your Highness can give your  
    self a Moment's Uneasiness about that little insignificant Fellow,  
    56 *Tom Thumb the Great* -- One properer for a Play-thing, than  
    a Husband. -- Were he my Husband, his Horns should be as long  
    as his Body. -- If you had fallen in Love with a Grenadier, I  
    should not have wonder'd at it -- If you had fallen in Love with  
    Something; but to fall in Love with Nothing!  
HUNCAMUNCA. Cease, my *Mustacha* , on thy Duty cease.  
    The *Zephyr* , when in flowry Vales it plays,  
    Is not so soft, so sweet as *Thummy's* Breath.  
    The Dove is not so gentle to its Mate.  
MUSTACHA. The Dove is every bit as proper for a Husband --  
    Alas! Madam, there's not a Beau about the Court looks so little  
    like a Man -- He is a perfect Butterfly, a Thing without
Substance,  
    and almost without Shadow too.  
HUNCAMUNCA. This Rudeness is unseasonable, desist;  
    Or, I shall think this Railing comes from Love.  
     *Tom Thumb's* a Creature of that charming Form,  
    That no one can abuse, unless they love him.  
MUSTACHA. Madam, the King.  
  
  

SCENE IV  
  
KING, HUNCAMUNCA.

  
KING. Let all but *Huncamunca* leave the Room.  
  
                                                            
              *Exit* CLEORA, *and* MUSTACHA.  
  
    Daughter, I have observ'd of late some Grief,  
    Unusual in your Countenance -- your Eyes,  
    57 That, like two open Windows, us'd to shew  
    The lovely Beauty of the Rooms within,  
    Have now two Blinds before them -- What is the Cause?  
    Say, have you not enough of Meat and Drink?  
    We've giv'n strict Orders not to have you stinted.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Alas! my Lord, I value not my self,  
    That once I eat two Fowls and half a Pig;  
    58 Small is that Praise; but oh! a Maid may want,  
    What she can neither eat nor drink.  
KING. What's that?  
HUNCAMUNCA. 59 O spare my Blushes; but I mean a Husband.  
KING. If that be all, I have provided one,  
    A husband great in Arms, whose warlike Sword  
    Streams with the yellow Blood of slaughter'd Giants.  
    Whose Name in *Terrâ Incognitâ* is known,  
    Whose Valour, Wisdom, Virtue make a Noise,  
    Great as the Kettle-Drums of twenty Armies.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Whom does my Royal Father mean?  
KING. *Tom Thumb* .  
HUNCAMUNCA. Is it possible?  
KING. Ha! the Window-Blinds are gone,  
    60 A Country Dance of Joy is in your Face,  
    Your Eyes spit Fire, your Cheeks grow red as Beef.  
HUNCAMUNCA. O, there's a Magick-musick in that Sound,  
    Enough to turn me into Beef indeed.  
    Yes, I will own, since licens'd by your Word,  
    I'll own *Tom Thumb* the Cause of all my Grief.  
    For him I've sigh'd, I've wept, I've gnaw'd my Sheets.  
KING. Oh! thou shalt gnaw thy tender Sheets no more,  
    A Husband thou shalt have to mumble now.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh! happy Sound! henceforth, let no one tell,  
    That *Huncamunca* shall lead Apes in Hell.  
    Oh! I am over-joy'd!  
KING. I see thou art.  
    61 Joy lightens in thy Eyes, and thunders from thy Brows;  
    Transports, like Lightning, dart along thy Soul,  
    As Small-shot thro' a hedge.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh! say not small.  
KING. This happy News shall on our Tongue ride Post,  
    Our self will bear the happy News to *Thumb* .  
    Yet think not, Daughter, that your powerful Charms  
    Must still detain the Hero from his Arms;  
    Various his Duty, various his Delight;  
    Now is his Turn to kiss, and now to fight;  
    And now to kiss again. So mighty 62 *Jove* ,  
    When with excessive thund'ring tir'd above,  
    Comes down to Earth, and takes a Bit -- and then,  
    Flies to his Trade of Thund'ring, back again.  
  
  

SCENE V  
  
GRIZZLE, HUNCAMUNCA.

  
63 GRIZZLE. Oh, *Huncamunca, Huncamunca* , oh,  
    Thy pouting Breasts, like Kettle-Drums of Brass,  
    Beat everlasting loud Alarms of Joy;  
    As bright as Brass they are, and oh, as hard;  
    Oh *Huncamunca, Huncamunca* ! oh!  
HUNCAMUNCA. Ha! do'st thou know me, Princess as I am,  
    64 That thus of me you dare to make your Game.  
GRIZZLE. Oh *Huncamunca* , well I know that you  
    A Princess are, and a King's Daughter too.  
    But Love no Meanness scorns, no Grandeur fears,  
    Love often Lords into the Cellar bears,  
    And bids the sturdy Porter come up Stairs.  
    For what's too high for Love, or what's too low?  
    Oh *Huncamunca, Huncamunca* , oh!  
HUNCAMUNCA. But granting all you say of Love were true,  
    My Love, alas! is to another due!  
    In vain to me, a Suitoring you come;  
    For I'm already promis'd to *Tom Thumb* .  
GRIZZLE. And can my Princess such a Durgen wed,  
    One fitter for your Pocket than your Bed!  
    Advis'd by me, the worthless Baby shun,  
    Or you will ne'er be brought to bed of one.  
    Oh take me to thy Arms and never flinch,  
    Who am a Man by *Jupiter* ev'ry Inch.  
    65 Then while in Joys together lost we lie  
    I'll press thy Soul while Gods stand wishing by.  
HUNCAMUNCA. If, Sir, what you insinuate you prove  
    All Obstacles of Promise you remove;  
    For all Engagements to a Man must fall,  
    Whene'er that Man is prov'd no Man at all.  
GRIZZLE. Oh let him seek some Dwarf, some fairy Miss,  
    Where no Joint-stool must lift him to the Kiss.  
    But by the Stars and Glory, you appear  
    Much fitter for a *Prussian* Grenadier;  
    One Globe alone, on *Atlas* Shoulders rests,  
    Two Globes are less than *Huncamunca's* Breasts:  
    The Milky-way is not so white, that's flat,  
    And sure thy Breasts are full as large as that.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh, Sir, so strong your Eloquence I find,  
    It is impossible to be unkind.  
GRIZZLE. Ah! speak that o'er again, and let the 66 Sound  
    From one Pole to another Pole rebound;  
    The Earth and Sky, each be a Battledoor  
    And keep the Sound, that Shuttlecock, up an Hour;  
    To *Doctors Commons* , for a License I,  
    Swift as an Arrow from a Bow will fly.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh no! lest some Disaster we should meet,  
    'Twere better to be marry'd at the Fleet.  
GRIZZLE. Forbid it, all ye Powers, a Princess should  
    By that vile Place, contaminate her Blood;  
    My quick Return shall to my Charmer prove,  
    I travel on the 67 Post-Horses of love.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Those Post-Horses to me will seem too slow,  
    Tho' they should fly swift as the Gods, when they  
    Ride on behind that Post-Boy, Opportunity.  
  
  

SCENE VI  
  
TOM THUMB, HUNCAMUNCA.

  
TOM THUMB. Where is my Princess, where's my *Huncamunca* ?  
    Where are those Eyes, those Cardmatches of Love,  
    That 68 Light up all with Love my waxen Soul?  
    Where is that Face which artful Nature made  
    69 In the same Moulds where *Venus* self was cast?  
HUNCAMUNCA. 70 Oh! What is Musick to the Ear that's deaf,  
    Or a Goose-Pye to him that has no taste?  
    What are these Praises now to me, since I  
    Am promis'd to another?  
TOM THUMB. Ha! promis'd.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Too sure; it's written in the Book of Fate.  
TOM THUMB. 71 Then I will tear away the Leaf  
    Wherein it's writ, or if Fate won't allow  
    So large a Gap within its Journal-Book,  
    I'll blot it out at least.  
  
  

SCENE VII  
  
GLUMDALCA, TOM THUMB, HUNCAMUNCA.

  
GLUMDALCA. 72 I need not ask if you are *Huncamunca* ,  
    Your Brandy Nose proclaims --  
HUNCAMUNCA. I am a Princess;  
    Nor need I ask who you are.  
GLUMDALCA. A Giantess;  
    The Queen of those who made and unmade Queens.  
HUNCAMUNCA. The Man, whose chief Ambition is to be  
    My Sweetheart, hath destroy'd these mightly Giants.  
GLUMDALCA. Your Sweetheart? do'st thou think the Man, who once  
    Hath worn my easy Chains, will e'er wear thine?  
HUNCAMUNCA. Well may your chains be easy, since if Fame  
    Says true, they have been try'd on twenty Husbands.  
    73 The Glove or Boot, so many times pull'd on,  
    May well sit easy on the Hand or Foot.  
GLUMDALCA. I glory in the Number, and when I  
    Sit poorly down, like thee, content with one,  
    Heaven change this Face for one as bad as thine.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Let me see nearer what this Beauty is,  
    That captivates the Heart of Men by Scores.  
  
                                                                     
               *Holds a Candle to her Face* .  
  
    Oh! Heaven, thou art as ugly as the Devil.  
GLUMDALCA. You'd give the best of Shoes within your Shop,  
    To be but half so handsome.  
HUNCAMUNCA. -- Since you come  
    74 To that, I'll put my Beauty to the Test;  
     *Tom Thumb* , I'm yours, if you with me will go.  
GLUMDALCA. Oh! stay, *Tom Thumb* , and you alone shall fill  
    That Bed where twenty giants us'd to lie.  
TOM THUMB. In the Balcony that o'er-hangs the Stage,  
    I've seen a Whore two 'Prentices engage;  
    One half a Crown does in his Fingers hold,  
    The other shews a little Piece of Gold;  
    She the Half Guinea wisely does purloin,  
    And leaves the larger and the baser Coin.  
  
                                                                     
                             *Exeunt all but GLUMDALCA* .  
  
GLUMDALCA. Left, scorn'd, and loath'd for such a Chit as this;  
    75 I feel the Storm that's rising in my Mind,  
    Tempests, and Whirlwinds rise, and rowl and roar.  
    I'm all within a Hurricane, as if  
    76 The World's four Winds were pent within my Carcass.  
    77 Confusion, Horror, Murder, Guts and Death.  
  
  

SCENE VIII  
  
KING, GLUMDALCA.

  
KING. 78 Sure never was so sad a King as I,  
    79 My Life is worn as ragged as a Coat  
    A Beggar wears; a Prince should put it off,  
    80 To love a Captive and a Giantess.  
    Oh Love! Oh Love! how great a King art thou!  
    My Tongue's thy Trumpet, and thou Trumpetest,  
    Unknown to me, within me. 81 oh *Glumdalca* !  
    Heaven thee design'd a Giantess to make,  
    But an Angelick Soul was shuffled in.  
    82 I am a Multitude of Walking Griefs,  
    And only on her Lips the Balm is found,  
    83 To spread a Plaister that might cure them all.  
GLUMDALCA. What do I hear?  
KING. What do I see?  
GLUMDALCA. Oh!  
KING. Ah!  
84 GLUMDALCA. Ah Wretched Queen!  
KING. Oh! Wretched King!  
GLUMDALCA. Ah!  
KING. 85 Oh!  
  
  

SCENE IX  
  
TOM THUMB, HUNCAMUNCA, PARSON.

  
PARSON. Happy's the Wooing, that's not long adoing;  
    For if I guess aright, *Tom Thumb* this Night  
    Shall give a Being to a New *Tom Thumb* .  
TOM THUMB. It shall be my Endeavour so to do.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh! fie upon you, Sir, you make me blush.  
TOM THUMB. It is the Virgin's Sign, and suits you well:  
    86 I know not where, nor how, nor what I am,  
    87 I'm so transported, I have lost my self.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Forbid it, all ye Stars, for you're so small,  
    That were you lost, you'd find your self no more.  
    So the unhappy Sempstress once, they say,  
    Her needle in a Pottle, lost, of Hay;  
    In vain she look'd, and look'd, and made her Moan,  
    For ah, the Needle was for ever gone.  
PARSON. Long may they live, and love, and propagate,  
    Till the whole Land be peopled with *Tom Thumbs* .  
    88 So when the *Cheshire* Cheese a Maggot breeds,  
    Another and another still succeeds.  
    By thousands, and ten thousands they increase,  
    Till one continued Maggot fills the rotten Cheese.  
  

SCENE X  
  
NOODLE, *and then* GRIZZLE.

  
NOODLE. 89 Sure Nature means to break her solid Chain,  
    Or else unfix the World, and in a Rage,  
    To hurl it from its Axle-tree and Hinges;  
    All things are so confus'd, the King's in Love,  
    The Queen is drunk, the Princess married is.  
GRIZZLE. Oh! *Noodle* , hast thou *Huncamunca* seen?  
NOODLE. I've seen a Thousand Sights this day, where none  
    Are by the wonderful Bitch herself outdone,  
    The King, the Queen, and all the Court are Sights.  
GRIZZLE. 90 D------n your Delay, you Trifler, are you drunk, ha?  
    I will not hear one Word but *Huncamunca* .  
NOODLE. By this time she is married to *Tom Thumb* .  
GRIZZLE. 91 My *Huncamunca* .  
NOODLE. Your *Huncamunca* .  
     *Tom Thumb's Huncamunca* , every Man's *Huncamunca* .  
GRIZZLE. If this be true all Womankind are damn'd.  
NOODLE. If it be not, may I be so my self.  
GRIZZLE. See where she comes! I'll not believe a Word  
    Against that Face, upon whose 92 ample Brow,  
    Sits Innocence with Majesty Enthron'd.  
  
                                   GRIZZLE, HUNCAMUNCA.  
  
GRIZZLE. Where has my *Huncamunca* been? See here  
    The Licence in my Hand!  
HUNCAMUNCA. Alas! *Tom Thumb* .  
GRIZZLE. Why dost thou mention him?  
HUNCAMUNCA. Ah me! *Tom Thumb* .  
GRIZZLE. What means my lovely *Huncamunca* ?  
HUNCAMUNCA. Hum!  
GRIZZLE. Oh! Speak.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Hum!  
GRIZZLE. Ha! your every Word is Hum  
    93 You force me still to answer you *Tom Thumb* .  
     *Tom Thumb* , I'm on the Rack, I'm in a Flame,  
    94 *Tom Thumb* , *Tom Thumb* , *Tom Thumb* , you love the Name;  
    So pleasing is that Sound, that were you dumb  
    You still would find a Voice to cry *Tom Thumb* .  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh! Be not hasty to proclaim my Doom,  
    My ample Heart for more than one has Room,  
    A Maid like me, Heaven form'd at least for two,  
    95 I married him, and now I'll marry you.  
GRIZZLE. Ha! dost thou own thy Falshood to my Face?  
    Think'st thou that I will share thy Husband's place,  
    Since to that Office one cannot suffice,  
    And since you scorn to dine one single Dish on,  
    Go, get your Husband put into Commission,  
    Commissioners to discharge, (ye Gods) it fine is,  
    The duty of a Husband to your Highness;  
    Yet think not long, I will my Rival bear,  
    Or unreveng'd the slighted Willow wear;  
    The gloomy, brooding Tempest now confin'd.  
    Within the hollow Caverns of my Mind,  
    In dreadful Whirl, shall rowl along the Coasts,  
    Shall thin the Land of all the Men it boasts,  
    96 And cram up ev'ry Chink of Hell with Ghosts.  
    97 So have I seen, in some dark Winter's Day,  
    A sudden Storm rush down the Sky's High-Way,  
    Sweep thro' the streets with terrible ding dong,  
    Gush thro' the Spouts, and wash whole Crowds along.  
    The crowded Shops, the thronging Vermin skreen,  
    Together cram the Dirty and the Clean,  
    And not one Shoe-Boy in the Street is seen.  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh! fatal Rashness should his Fury slay,  
    My hapless Bridegroom on his Wedding Day;  
    I, who this Morn, of two chose which to wed,  
    May go again this Night alone to Bed;  
    98 So have I seen some wild unsettled Fool,  
    Who had her Choice of this, and that Joint Stool;  
    To give the Preference to either, loath  
    And fondly coveting to sit on both:  
    While the two Stools her Sitting Part confound,  
    Between 'em both fall Squat upon the Ground.

ACT III  
  
SCENE I  
  
SCENE, *King* Arthur's *Palace* .  
99 GHOST *solus* .

  
GHOST. Hail! ye black Horrors of Midnight's Midnoon!  
    Ye Fairies, Goblins, Bats and Screech-Owls, Hail!  
    And Oh! ye mortal Watchmen, whose hoarse Throats  
    Th' Immortal Ghosts dread Croakings counterfeit,  
    All Hail! -- Ye dancing Fantoms, who by Day,  
    Are some condemn'd to fast, some feast in Fire;  
    Now play in Church-yards, skipping o'er the Graves,  
    To the 100 loud Musick of the silent Bell,  
    All Hail!  
  
  

SCENE II  
  
KING, *and* GHOST.

  
KING. What Noise is this? -- What Villain dares,  
    At this dread Hour, with Feet and Voice prophane,  
    Disturb our Royal Walls?  
GHOST. One who defines  
    Thy empty Power to hurt him; 101 one who dares  
    Walk in thy Bed-Chamber.  
KING. Presumptuous Slave!  
    Thou diest!  
GHOST. Threaten others with that Word,  
    102 I am a Ghost, and am already dead.  
KING. Ye Stars! 'tis well; were thy last Hour to come,  
    This Moment had been it; 103 yet by thy Shrowd  
    I'll pull thee backward, squeeze thee to a Bladder,  
    'Till thou dost groan thy Nothingness away.  
  
                                                                     
                             GHOST *retires* .  
  
    Thou fly'st! 'Tis well.  
    104 I thought what was the Courage of a Ghost!  
    Yet, dare not, on thy Life -- Why say I that,  
    Since Life thou hast not? -- Dare not walk again,  
    Within these Walls, on pain of the *Red-Sea* .  
    For, if henceforth I ever find thee here,  
    As sure, sure as a Gun, I'll have thee laid --  
GHOST. Were the *Red-Sea* , a Sea of *Holland's* Gin,  
    The Liquor (when alive) whose very Smell  
    I did detest, did loath -- yet for the Sake  
    Of *Thomas Thumb* , I would be laid therein.  
KING. Ha! said you?  
GHOST. Yes, my Liege, I said *Tom Thumb* ,  
    Whose Father's Ghost I am -- once not unknown  
    To mighty *Arthur* . But, I see, 'tis true,  
    The dearest Friend, when dead, we all forget.  
KING. 'Tis he, it is the honest Gaffer *Thumb* .  
    Oh, let me press thee in my eager Arms,  
    Thou best of Ghosts! Thou something more than Ghost!  
GHOST. Would I were Something more, that we again  
    Might feel each other in the warm Embrace.  
    But now I have th' Advantage of my King,  
    105 For I feel thee, whilst thou dost not feel me.  
KING. But say, 106 thou dearest Air, Oh! say, what Dread,  
    Important Business sends thee back to Earth?  
GHOST. Oh! then prepare to hear -- which, but to hear,  
    Is full enough to send thy spirit hence.  
    Thy Subjects up in Arms, by *Grizzle* led,  
    Will, ere the rosy finger'd Morn shall ope  
    The Shutters of the Sky, before the Gate  
    Of this thy Toyal Palace, swarming spread:  
    107 So have I seen the Bees in Clusters swarm,  
    So have I seen the Stars in frosty Nights,  
    So have I seen the Sand in windy Days,  
    So have I seen the Ghosts on *Pluto's* Shore,  
    So have I seen the Flowers in Spring arise,  
    So have I seen the Leaves in *Autumn* fall,  
    So have I seen the Fruits in Summer smile,  
    So have I seen the Snow in Winter frown.  
KING. D------n all thou'st seen! -- Dost thou, beneath the Shape  
    Of Gaffer *Thumb* , come hither to abuse me,  
    With Similies to keep me on the Rack?  
    Hence -- or by all the Torments of thy Hell,  
    108 I'll run thee thro' the Body, tho' thou'st none.  
GHOST. *Arthur* , beware; I must this Moment hence,  
    Not frighted by your Voice, but by the Cocks;  
     *Arthur* beware, beware, beware, beware!  
    Strive to avert thy yet impending Fate;  
    For if thou'rt kill'd To-day  
    To-morrow all thy Care will come too late.  
  

SCENE III  
  
KING *solus* .

  
KING. Oh! stay, and leave me not uncertain thus!  
    And whilst thou tellest me what's like my Fate,  
    Oh, teach me how I may avert it too!  
    Curst be the Man who first a Simile made!  
    Curst, ev'ry Bard who writes! -- So have I seen  
    Those whose Comparisons are just and true,  
    And those who liken things not like at all.  
    The Devil is happy, that the whole Creation  
    Can furnish out no Simile to his Fortune.  
  

SCENE IV  
  
KING, QUEEN.

  
QUEEN. What is the Cause, my *Arthur* , that you steal  
    Thus silently from *Dollallolla's* Breast?  
    Why dost thou leave me in the 109 Dark alone,  
    When well thou know'st I am afraid of Sprites?  
KING. Oh *Dollallolla* ! do not blame my Love;  
    I hop'd the Fumes of Last Night's Punch had laid  
    Thy lovely Eye-lids fast. -- But, Oh! I find  
    There is no Power in Drams, to quiet Wives;  
    Each Morn, as the returning Sun, they wake,  
    And shine upon their Husbands.  
QUEEN. Think, Oh think!  
    What a Surprize it must be to the Sun,  
    Rising, to find the vanish'd World away.  
    What less can be the wretched Wife's Surprize,  
    When, stretching out her Arms to fold thee fast,  
    She folds her useless Bolster in her Arms.  
    110 Think, think on that -- Oh! think, think well on that.  
    I do remember also to have read  
    111 In *Dryden's Ovid's Metamorphosis* ,  
    That *Jove* in Form inanimate did lie  
    With beauteous *Danae* ; and trust me, Love  
    112 I fear'd the Bolster might have been a *Jove* .  
KING. Come to my Arms, most virtuous of thy Sex;  
    Oh *Dollallolla* ! were all Wives like thee,  
    So many Husbands never had worn Horns.  
    Should Huncamunca of thy Worth partake,  
     *Tom Thumb* indeed were blest. -- Oh fatal Name!  
    For didst thou know one Quarter what I know,  
    Then would'st thou know -- Alas! what thou would'st know!  
QUEEN. What can I gather hence? Why dost thou speak  
    Like Men who carry *Raree-Shows* about,  
     *Now you shall see, Gentlemen, what you shall see* ?  
    O tell me more, or thou hast told too much.  
  
  

SCENE V  
  
KING, QUEEN, NOODLE.

  
NOODLE. Long life attend your Majesties serene,  
    Great *Arthur* , King, and *Dollallolla* , Queen!  
    Lord *Grizzle* , with a bold, rebellious Crowd,  
    Advances to the Palace, threat'ning loud,  
    Unless the Princess be deliver'd straight,  
    And the victorious *Thumb* , without his Pate,  
    They are resolv'd to batter down the Gate.  
  
  

SCENE VI  
  
KING, QUEEN, HUNCAMUNCA, NOODLE.

  
KING. See where the Princess comes! Where is *Tom Thumb* ?  
HUNCAMUNCA. Oh! Sir, about an Hour and half ago  
    He sallied out to encounter with the Foe,  
    And swore, unless his Fate had him mis-led,  
    From *Grizzle's* Shoulders to cut off his Head,  
    And serve't up with your Chocolate in Bed.  
KING. 'Tis well, I find one Devil told us both.  
    Come *Dollallolla, Huncamunca* , come,  
    Within we'll wait for the victorious *Thumb* ;  
    In Peace and Safety we secure may stay,  
    While to his Arm we trust the bloody Fray;  
    Tho' Men and Giants should conspire with Gods,  
    113 He is alone equal to all these Odds.  
QUEEN. He is indeed, a 114 Helmet to us all,  
    While he supports, we need not fear to fall;  
    His Arm dispatches all things to our Wish,  
    And serves up every Foe's Head in a Dish.  
    Void is the Mistress of the House of Care,  
    While the good Cook presents the Bill of Fare;  
    Whether the Cod, that Northern King of Fish,  
    Or Duck, or Goose, or Pig, adorn the Dish.  
    No Fears the Number of her Guests afford,  
    But at her Hour she sees the Dinner on the Board.  
  
  

SCENE VII  
  
, *a Plain* .  
*Lord* GRIZZLE, FOODLE, *and Rebels* .  

  
GRIZZLE. Thus far our Arms with Victory are crown'd;  
    For tho' we have not fought, yet we have found  
    115 No Enemy to fight withal.  
FOODLE. Yet I,  
    Methinks, would willingly avoid this Day,  
    116 This First of *April* , to engage our Foes.  
GRIZZLE. This Day, of all the Days of th' Year, I'd choose,  
    For on this Day my Grandmother was born.  
    Gods! I will make *Tom Thumb* an *April* Fool;  
    117 Will teach his Wit an Errand it ne'er knew,  
    And send it Post to the *Elysian* Shades.  
FOODLE. I'm glad to find our Army is so stout,  
    Nor does it move my Wonder less than Joy.  
GRIZZLE. 118 What Friends we have, and how we came so strong,  
    I'll softly tell you as we march along.  
  
  

SCENE VIII  
  
*Thunder and Lightning* .  
TOM THUMB, GLUMDALCA *cum suis* .

  
TOM THUMB. Oh, *Noodle* ! hast thou seen a Day like this?  
    119 The unborn Thunder rumbles o'er our Heads,  
    120 As if the Gods meant to unhinge the World;  
    And Heaven and Earth in wild Confusion hurl;  
    Yet will I boldly tread the tott'ring Ball.  
MERLIN. *Tom Thumb!*  
TOM THUMB. What Voice is this I hear?  
MERLIN. *Tom Thumb!*  
TOM THUMB. Again it calls.  
MERLIN. *Tom Thumb!*  
GLUMDALCA. It calls again.  
TOM THUMB. Appear, whoe'er thou art, I fear thee not.  
MERLIN. Thou hast no Cause to fear, I am thy Friend,  
     *Merlin* by Name, a Conjuror by Trade,  
    And to my Art thou dost thy Being owe.  
TOM THUMB. How!  
MERLIN. Hear then the mystick Getting of *Tom Thumb* .  
                121 *His Father was a Ploughman plain,  
                    His Mother milk'd the Cow;  
                And yet the way to get a Son,  
                    This Couple knew not how.  
                Until such time the good old Man  
                    To learned* Merlin *goes,  
                And there to him, in great Distress,  
                    In secret manner shows;  
                How in his Heart he wish'd to have  
                    A Child, in time to come,  
                To be his Heir, tho' it might be  
                    No biger than his Thumb:  
                Of which old* Merlin *was foretold,  
                    That he his Wish should have;  
                And so a Son of Stature small,  
                    The Charmer to him gave* .  
    Thou'st heard the past, look up and see the future.  
TOM THUMB. 122 Lost in Amazement's Gulph, my Senses sink;  
    See there, *Glumdalca* , see another 123 Me!  
GLUMDALCA. O Sight of Horror! see, you are devour'd  
    By the expanded Jaws of a red Cow.  
MERLIN. Let not these Sights deter thy noble Mind,  
    124 For lo! a Sight more glorious courts thy Eyes;  
    See from a far a Theatre arise;  
    There Ages yet unborn, shall Tribute pay  
    To the Heroick Actions of this Day:  
    Then Buskin Tragedy at length shall choose  
    Thy Name the best Supporter of her Muse.  
TOM THUMB. Enough, let every warlike Musick sound,  
    We fall contented, if we fall renown'd.  
  
  

SCENE IX  
  
*Lord* GRIZZLE, FOODLE, *Rebels, on one Side* .  
TOM THUMB, GLUMDALCA, *on the other* .

  
FOODLE. At length the Enemy advances nigh,  
    125 I hear them with my Ear, and see them with my Eye.  
GRIZZLE. Draw all your Swords, for Liberty we fight,  
    126 And Liberty the Mustard is of Life.  
TOM THUMB. Are you the Man whom Men fam'd *Grizzle* name?  
GRIZZLE. 127 Are you the much more fam'd *Tom Thumb* ?  
TOM THUMB. The same.  
GRIZZLE. Come on, our Worth upon our selves we'll prove,  
    For Liberty I fight.  
TOM THUMB. And I for Love.  
  

> > > > > *A bloody Engagement between the two Armies here, Drums
> > > > > beating, Trumpets sounding, Thunder and Lightning. -- They
> > > > > fight off and on several times. Some fall* . GRIZZLE *and*
> > > > > GLUMDALCA *remain* .

GLUMDALCA. Turn, Coward, turn, nor from a Woman fly.  
GRIZZLE. Away -- thou art too ignoble for my Arm.  
GLUMDALCA. Have at thy Heart.  
GRIZZLE. Nay then, I thrust at thine.  
GLUMDALCA. You push too well, you've run me thro' the Guts,  
    And I am dead.  
GRIZZLE. Then there's an End of One.  
TOM THUMB. When thou art dead, then there's an End of Two,  
    128 Villain.  
GRIZZLE. *Tom Thumb!*  
TOM THUMB. Rebel!  
GRIZZLE. *Tom Thumb!*  
TOM THUMB. Hell!  
GRIZZLE. *Huncamunca!*  
TOM THUMB. Thou hast it there.  
GRIZZLE. Too sure I feel it.  
TOM THUMB. To Hell then, like a Rebel as you are,  
    And give my Service to the Rebels there.  
GRIZZLE. Triumph not, *Thumb* , nor think thou shalt enjoy  
    Thy *Huncamunca* undisturb'd, I'll send  
    129 My Ghost to fetch her to the other World;  
    130 It shall but bait at Heaven, and then return.  
    131 But, ha! I feel Death rumbling in my Brains,  
    132 Some kinder Spright knocks softly at my Soul,  
    And gently whispers it to haste away:  
    I come, I come, most willingly I come.  
    133 So; when some City Wife, for Country Air,  
    To *Hampstead* , or to *Highgate* does repair;  
    Her, to make haste, Her Husband does implore,  
    And cries, My Dear, *the Coach is at the Door* .  
    With equal Wish, desirous to be gone,  
    She gets into the Coach, and then she cries -- *Drive on!*  
TOM THUMB. With those last Words 134 he vomited his Soul,  
    Which, 135 like whipt Cream, the Devil will swallow down.  
    Bear off the Body, and cut off the Head,  
    Which I will to the King in Triumph lug;  
    Rebellion's dead, and now I'll go to Breakfast.  
  
  

SCENE X  
  
KING, QUEEN, HUNCAMUNCA, *and Courtiers* .

  
KING. Open the Prisons, set the Wretched free,  
    And bid our Treasurer disburse six Pounds  
    To pay their Debts. -- Let no one weep To-day.  
    Come, *Dollallolla* ; 136 Curse that odious Name!  
    It is so long, it asks an Hour to speak it.  
    By Heavens! I'll change it into *Doll* , or *Loll* ,  
    Or any other civil Monosyllable  
    That will not tire my Tongue. -- Come, sit thee down.  
    Here seated, let us view the Dancer's Sports;  
    Bid 'em advance. This is the Wedding-Day  
    Of Princess *Huncamunca* and *Tom Thumb* ;  
     *Tom Thumb!* who wins two Victories 137 To-day,  
    And this way marches, bearing *Grizzle's* Head.  
  
                                                                     
                 *A Dance here* .  
  
NOODLE. Oh! monstrous, dreadful, terrible, Oh! Oh!  
    Deaf be my Ears, for ever blind my Eyes!  
    Dumb be my Tongue! Feet lame! All senses lost!  
    138 Howl Wolves, grunt Bears, hiss Snakes, shriek all ye Ghosts!  
KING. What does the Blockhead mean?  
NOODLE. I mean, my Liege  
    139 Only to grace my Tale with decent Horror;  
    Whilst from my Garret, twice two Stories high,  
    I look'd abroad into the Streets below;  
    I saw *Tom Thumb* attended by the Mob,  
    Twice Twenty Shoe-Boys, twice two Dozen Links,  
    Chairmen and Porters, Hackney-Coachmen, Whores;  
    Aloft he bore the grizly Head of *Grizzle* ;  
    When of a sudden thro' the Streets there came  
    A Cow, of larger than the usual Size,  
    And in a Moment -- guess, Oh! guess the rest!  
    And in a Moment swallow'd up *Tom Thumb* .  
KING. Shut up again the Prisons, bid my Treasurer  
    Not give three Farthings out -- hang all the *Culprits* ,  
    Guilty or not -- no matter -- Ravish Virgins,  
    Go bid the Schoolmasters whip all their Boys;  
    Let Lawyers, Parsons, and Physicians loose,  
    To rob, impose on, and to kill the World.  
NOODLE. Her Majesty the Queen is in a Swoon.  
QUEEN. Not so much in a swoon, but I have still  
    Strength to reward the Messenger of ill News.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills* NOODLE.  
  
NOODLE. Oh! I am slain.  
CLEORA. My Lover's kill'd, I will revenge him so.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills the* QUEEN.  
  
HUNCAMUNCA. My Mamma kill'd! vile Murtheress, beware.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills* CLEORA.  
  
DOODLE. This for an old Grudge, to thy Heart.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills* HUNCAMUNCA.  
  
MUSTACHA. And this  
    I drive to thine, Oh *Doodle* ! for a new one.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills* DOODLE.  
  
KING. Ha! Murtheress vile, take that  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills* MUSTACHA.  
    140 And take thou this.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Kills himself, and falls* .  
  
    So when the Child whom Nurse from Danger guards,  
    Sends *Jack* for Mustard with a Pack of Cards;  
    Kings, Queens and Knaves throw one another down,  
    'Till the whole Pack lies scatter'd and o'erthrown;  
    So all our Pack upon the Floor is cast,  
    And all I boast is -- that I fall the last.  
  
                                                                     
                               *Dies* .  
  

FINIS.

  
  
  
  

**NOTES**

  
1 *Corneille* recommends some very remarkable Day, wherein to fix the
Action of a Tragedy. This the best of our Tragical Writers have
understood to mean a Day remarkable for the Serenity of the Sky, or what
we generally call a fine Summer's Day: So that according to this their
Exposition, the same Months are proper for Tragedy, which are proper for
Pastoral. Most of our celebrated *English* Tragedies, as *Cato,
Mariamne, Tamerlane* , &c. begin with their Observations on the Morning.
*Lee* seems to have come the nearest to this beautiful Description of
our Authors;  

> > *The Morning dawns with an unwonted Crimson,  
> > The Flowers all odorous seem, the Garden Birds  
> > Sing louder, and the* laughing *Sun ascends,  
> > The gaudy Earth with an unusual brightness,  
> > All Nature smiles.*   (Caes. Borg.)

*Massinissa* in the new *Sophonisba* is also a Favourite of the Sun;  

> > *-- The Sun too seems  
> > As conscious of my Joy with broader Eye  
> > To look abroad the World, and all things smile  
> > Like* Sophonisba.

*Memnon* in the *Persian Princess* , makes the Sun decline rising, that
he may not peep on Objects, which would prophane his Brightness.  

> > -- *The Morning rises slow,  
> > And all those ruddy Streaks that us'd to paint  
> > The Days Approach, are lost in Clouds as if  
> > The Horrors of the Night had sent 'em back,  
> > To warn the Sun, he should not leave the Sea,  
> > To Peep* , &c.

2 This Line is highly conformable to the beautiful Simplicity of the
Antients. It hath been copied by almost every Modern,  
  
             *Not to be is not to be in Woe.*   (State of Innocence.)  
  
             *Love is not Sin but where 'tis sinful Love.*   (Don
Sebastian.)  
  
             *Nature is Nature,* Laelius.  (Sophonisba.)  
  
             *Men are but Men, we did not make our selves.*
  (Revenge.)  
  
  
3 Dr. *B------y* reads the mighty Tall-mast Thumb. Mr. *D------s* the
mighty Thumping Thumb. Mr. T------d reads Thundering. I think *Thomas*
more agreeable to the great Simplicity so apparent in our Author.  
  
4 That learned Historian Mr. *S------n* in the third Number of his
Criticism on our Author, takes great Pains to explode this Passage. It
is, says he, difficult to guess what Giants are here meant, unless the
Giant *Despair* in the *Pilgrim's Progress* , or the Giant *Greatness*
in the *Royal Villain* ; for I have heard of no other sort of Giants in
the Reign of King *Arthur. Petrus Burmanus* makes three *Tom Thumbs* ,
one whereof he supposes to have been the same Person whom the *Greeks*
called *Hercules* , and that by these Giants are to be understood the
*Centaurs* slain by that Heroe. Another *Tom Thumb* he contends to have
been no other than the *Hermes Trismegistus* of the Antients. The third
*Tom Thumb* he places under the Reign of King *Arthur* , to which third
*Tom Thumb* , says he, the Actions of the other two were attributed. Now
tho' I know that this Opinion is supported by an Assertion of *Justus
Lipsius, Thomam illum Thumbum non alium quam Herculem fuisse satis
constat* ; yet shall I venture to oppose one Line of Mr. *Midwinter* ,
against them all,  
  
             *In* Arthur's *Court* Tom Thumb *did live* .  
  
But then, says Dr. *B------y* , if we place *Tom Thumb* in the Court of
King *Arthur* , it will be proper to place that Court out of *Britain* ,
where no Giants were ever heard of. *Spencer* , in his *Fairy Queen* ,
is of another Opinion, where describing *Albion* he says,  
  
             *-- Far within a salvage Nation dwelt  
             Of hideous Giants* .  
  
And in the same Canto,  
  
             *Then* Elfar, *who two Brethren Giants had,  
             The one of which had two Heads --  
                 The other three* .  
  
Risum teneatis, Amici.  
  
5 To whisper in Books says Mr. *D------s* is errant Nonsense. I am
afraid this learned Man does not sufficiently understand the extensive
meaning of the Word Whisper. If he had rightly understood what is meant
by the *Senses Whisp'ring the Soul* in the *Persian Princess* , or what
*Whisp'ring like Winds* is in *Aurengzebe* , or like Thunder in another
Author, he would have understood this. *Emmeline* in *Dryden* sees a
Voice, but she was born blind, which is an Excuse *Panthea* cannot plead
in *Cyrus* , who hears a sight.  
  
             *-- Your Description will surpass,  
             All Fiction, Painting, or dumb Shew of Horror,  
             That ever Ears yet heard, or Eyes beheld* .  
  
When Mr. *D------s* understands these he will understand Whisp'ring in
Books.  
  
6            -- *Some Ruffian stept into his Father's Place* ,  
             And more than half begot him.  ( *Mary Q. of Scots* ).  
  
7            -- *For* Ulamar *seems* sent Express from Heaven,  
             *To civilize this rugged* Indian *Clime* .  (Liberty
Asserted.)  
  
8 *Omne majus continet in se minus, sed minus non in se majus continere
potest* , says *Scaliger* in *Thumbo* . - I suppose he would have
cavilled at these beautiful Lines in the Earl of *Essex* ;  
  
             *-- Thy most inveterate Soul,  
             That looks through the foul Prison of thy Body* .  
  
             And at those of *Dryden,  
  
             The Palace is without too well design'd,  
             Conduct me in, for I will view thy Mind.  * (Aurengzebe.)  
  
9 Mr. *Banks* hath copied this almost Verbatim,  
  
             *It was enough to say, here's* Essex *come,  
             And Nurses still'd their Children with the fright.  * (E.
of *Essex* .)  
  
10 The Trumpet in a Tragedy is generally as much as to say enter King:
Which makes Mr. *Banks* in one of his Plays call it the Trumpets's
formal Sound.  
  
11 *Phraortes* in the *Captives* seems to have been acquainted with King
*Arthur* .  
  
             *Proclaim a Festival for seven Days space,  
             Let the Court shine in all its Pomp and Lustre,  
             Let all our Streets resound with Shouts of Joy;  
             Let Musick's Care-dispelling Voice be heard,  
             The sumptuous Banquet, and the flowing Goblet  
             Shall warm the Cheek, and fill the Heart with Gladness.  
             Astarbe shall sit Mistress of the Feast* .  
  
12         *Repentance* frowns on *thy contracted Brow*
.  (Sophonisba.)  
  
             *Hung on his clouded Brow, I mark'd Despair* .  (Ibid.)  
  
*             -- A sullen Gloom,*  
*             Scowls on his Brow* .  (Busiris.)  
  
13 *Plato* is of this Opinion, and so is Mr. *Banks* ;  
  
             *Behold these Tears sprung from fresh Pain and Joy* .  (E.
of *Essex* .)  
  
14 These Floods are very frequent in the Tragick Authors.  
  
             *Near to some murmuring Brook I'll lay me down,  
             Whose Waters if they should too shallow flow,  
             My Tears shall swell them up till I will drown* .  (Lee's
Sophonisba.)  
  
             *Pouring forth Tears at such a lavish Rate,  
             That were the World on Fire, they might have drown'd  
             The Wrath of Heav'n, and quench'd the mighty Ruin*
.  (Mithridates.)  
  
   One Author changes the Waters of Grief to those of Joy,

             *-- These Tears that sprung from Tides of Grief,  
             Are now augmented to a Flood of Joy* .  (Cyrus the
Great.)  
  
   Another,

             *Turns all the Streams of Hates, and makes them flow  
             In Pity's Channel* .  (Royal Villain.)  
  
   One drowns himself,  
  
             *-- Pity like a Torrent* pours *me down,  
             Now I am drowning all within a Deluge* .  (Anna Bullen.)  
  
    *Cyrus* drowns the whole world,  
  
             *Our swellin Grief  
             Shall melt into a Deluge, and the World  
             Shall drown in Tears.*   (Cyrus the Great.)  
  
15 An Expression vastly beneath the Dignity of Tragedy, says Mr.
*D------s* , yet we find the Word he cavils at in the Mouth of
*Mithridates* less properly used and applied to a more terrible Idea;  
  
             *I would be drunk with Death* .  (Mithrid.)  
  
The Author of the New *Sophonisba* taketh hold of this Monosyllable, and
uses it pretty much to the same purpose,  
  
             *The* Carthaginian *Sword with* Roman *Blood  
             Was drunk* .  
  
I would ask Mr. *D------s* which gives him the best Idea, a drunken
King, or a drunken Sword?  
Mr. *Tate* dresses up King *Arthur's* Resolution in Heroicks,  
  
             *Merry, my Lord, o' th' Captain's Humour right,  
             I am resolv'd to be dead drunk to Night* .  
  
Lee also uses this charming Word;  
  
             *Love's the Drunkenness of the Mind* .  (Gloriana.)  
  
16 *Dryden* hath borrowed this, and applied it improperly,  
  
             *I'm half Seas o'er in Death* .  (Cleom.)  
  
17 This Figure is in great use among the Tragedians;  
  
             *'Tis therefore, therefore 'tis* .  (Victim.)  
  
             *I long repent, repent and long again* .  (Busiris.)  
  
18 A Tragical Exclamation.  
  
19 This Line is copied verbatim in the *Captives* .  
  
20We find a Candlestick for this Candle in two celebrated Authors;

             *-- Each Star withdraws  
             His golden Head and burns within the Socket.*   (Nero.)  
  
             *A Soul grown old and sunk into the Socket*
.  (Sebastian.)  
  
21 This Simile occurs very frequently among the Dramatick Writers of
both Kinds.  
  
22 Mr. Lee hath stolen this Thought from our Author;

             *-- This perfect Face, drawn by the Gods in Council,  
             Which they were long a making.*   (Lu. Jun. Brut.)  
  
             *-- At his Birth, the heavenly Council paus'd,  
             And then at last cry'd out, This is a Man!  
  
Dryden* hath improved this Hint to the utmost Perfection:  
  
             *So perfect, that the very Gods who form'd you, wonder'd  
             At their own Skill, and cry'd, A lucky Hit  
             Has mended our Design! Their Envy hindred,  
             Or you had been Immortal, and a Pattern,  
             When Heaven would work for Ostentation sake,  
             To copy out again* .  (All for Love.)  
  
*Banks* prefers the Works of *Michael Angelo* to that of the Gods;  
  
             *A Pattern for the Gods to make a Man by,  
             Or* Michael Angelo *to form a Statue* .  
  
23 It is impossible says Mr. *W------* sufficiently to admire this
natural easy Line.  
  
24 This Tragedy which in most Points resembles the Antients differs from
them in this, that it assigns the same Honour to Lowness of Stature,
which they did to Height. The Gods and Heroes in *Homer* and *Virgil*
are continually described higher by the Head than their Followers, the
contrary of which is observ'd by our Author: In short, to exceed on
either side is equally admirable, and a Man of three Foot is as
wonderful a sight as a Man of nine.  
  
25      *        My Blood leaks fast, and the great heavy lading  
             My Soul will quickly sink.*   (Mithrid.)  
  
             *My Soul is like a Ship* .  (Injur'd Love.)  
  
26 This well-bred Line seems to be copied in the *Persian Princess* ;

             *To be your humblest, and most faithful Slave* .  
  
27 This Doubt of the King puts me in mind of a Passage in the *Captives*
, where the Noise of Feet is mistaken for the Rustling of Leaves,

             *-- Methinks I hear  
             The sound of Feet  
             No, 'twas the Wind that* shook yon Cypress Boughs.  
  
28 Mr. *Dryden* seems to have had this Passage in his Eye in the first
Page of *Love Triumphant* .  
  
29 *Don Carlos* in the Revenge suns himself in the Charms of his
Mistress,

             *While in the Lustre of her Charms I lay* .  
  
30 A tragical phrase much in use.  
  
31 This Speech hath been taken to pieces by several Tragical Authors who
seem to have rifled it and shared its Beauties among them.

             *My soul waits at the Portal of thy Breast,  
             To ravish from thy Lips the welcome News.*   (Anna
Bullen.)  
  
             *My Soul stands listening at my Ears* .  (Cyrus the
Great.)  
  
             *Love to his Tune my jarring Heart would bring,  
             But Reason overwinds and cracks the String.*   (D. of
Guise.)  
  
             *-- I should have lov'd,  
             Tho'* Jove *in* muttering *Thunder had forbid it* .  (New
Sophonisba.)  
  
             *And when it* (my Heart) *wild resolves to love no more,  
             Then is the Triumph of excessive Love* .  (Ibidem.)  
  
32 *Massinissa* is one fourth less happy than *Tom Thumb* .

             *Oh! happy, happy, happy.*   (New Sophonisba.)  
  
33            *No by my self.*   (Anna Bullen.)  
  
34          *-- Who caus'd  
             This dreadful Revolution in my Fate?  
                * Ulamar. *Who but a Dog, who but a Dog?*   (Liberty
Asserted.)  
  
35      *    -- A Bride,  
             Who twenty Years lay* loving *by your side* .  (Banks.)  
  
36          *For born upon a Cloud, from high I'll fall,  
             And rain down Royal Vengeance on you all.*   (Albion
Queens.)  
  
37 An Information very like this we have in the *Tragedy of Love* ,
where *Cyrus* having stormed in the most violent manner, *Cyaxares*
observes very calmly,  
  
             *Why, Nephew *Cyrus --* you are mov'd* .  
  
38          *'Tis in your Choice,  
             Love me, or love me not!*   (Conquest of Granada.)  
  
39 There is not one Beauty in this Charming Speech, but hath been
borrowed by almost every Tragick Writer.  
  
40 Mr. *Banks* has (I wish I could not say too servilely) imitated this
of *Grizzle* in his *Earl of Essex.*

*             Where art thou* Essex, &c.  
  
41 The Countess of *Nottingham* in the *Earl of Essex* is apparently
acquainted with *Dollalolla* .  
  
42 *Grizzle* was not probably possessed of that Glew, of which Mr.
*Banks* speaks in his *Cyrus* .  
  
             *I'll glew my Ears to ev'ry word.*  
  
43          *    Screech-Owls, dark Ravens and amphibious Monsters,  
             Are screaming in that Voice* .  (Mary Q. of Scots.)  
  
44 The Reader may see all the Beauties of this Speech in a late Ode
called the *Naval Lyrick* .  
  
45 This Epithet to a Dolphin doth not give one so clear an Idea as were
to be wished, a smiling Fish seeming a little more difficult to be
imagined than a flying Fish. Mr. *Dryden* is of Opinion, that smiling is
the Property of Reason, and that no irrational Creature can smile.  
  
             *Smiles not allowed to Beasts from Reason move* .  (State
of Innocence.)  
  
46 These Lines are written in the same Key with those in the *Earl of
Essex;*

*             Why sayst thou so, I love thee well, indeed  
             I do, and thou shalt find by this, 'tis true.*  
  
Or with this in *Cyrus;  
  
             The most heroick Mind that ever was.*  
  
And with above half of the modern Tragedies.  
  
47 *Aristotle* in that excellent Work of his which is very justly stiled
his Masterpiece, earnestly recommends using the Terms of Art, however
coarse or even indecent they may be. Mr. *Tate* is of the same Opinion.

             Bru. *Do not, like young Hawks, fetch a Course about,  
                    Your Game flies fair.*  
             Fra. *Do not fear it* .  
                    He answers you in your own *Hawking Phrase*
.  (Injur'd Love.)  

I think these two great Authorities are sufficient to justify
*Dollalolla* in the use of the Phrase -- *Hie away hie* ; when in the
same Line she says she is speaking to a setting Dog.  
  
48 We meet with such another Pair of Scales in *Dryden's* King *Arthur*
.

             Arthur *and* Oswald *and their different Fates,  
             Are weighing now within the Scales of Heav'n*  

Also in *Sebastian.  
*

*             This Hour my Lot is weighing in the Scales* .  
  
49 Mr. *Rowe* is generally imagin'd to have taken some Hints from this
Scene in his Character of *Bajazet* ; but as he, of all the Tragick
Writers, bears the least Resemblance to our Author in his Diction, I am
unwilling to imagine he would condescend to copy him in this
particular.  
  
50 This method of surprizing an Audience by raising their Expectation to
the highest Pitch, and then baulking it, hath been practis'd with great
Success by most of our Tragical Authors.  
  
51 *Almeyda* in *Sebastian* is in the same Distress;  
  
             *Sometimes methinks I hear the Groan of Ghosts,  
             Thin hollow Sounds and lamentable Screams;  
             Then, like a dying Echo from afar,  
             My Mother's Voice that cries, wed not* Almeyda  
             *Forewarn'd* , Almeyda, *Marriage is thy Crime* .  
  
52 As very well he may if he hath any Modesty in him, says Mr.
*D------s* . The Author of *Busiris* , is extremely zealous to prevent
the Sun's blushing at any indecent Object; and therefore on all such
Occasions he addresses himself to the Sun, and desires him to keep out
of the way.  
  
             *Rise never more, O Sun! let Night prevail,  
             Eternal Darkness close the World's wide Scene*
.  (Busiris.)  
  
             *Sun hide thy Face and put the World in Mourning.*
  (Ibid.)  
  
Mr. *Banks* makes the Sun perform the Office of *Hymen* ; and therefore
not likely to be disgusted at such a Sight;  
  
             *The Sun sets forth like a gay Brideman with you* .  (Mary
Q. of Scots.)  
  
53 *Nourmahal* sends the same Message to Heaven;  
  
             *For I would have you, when you upwards move,  
             Speak kindly of us, to our Friends above.*
  (Aurengzebe.)  
  
We find another to Hell, in the *Persian* Princess;  
  
             *Villain, get thee down  
             To Hell, and tell them that the Fray's begun.*  
  
54 *Anthony* gives the same Command in the same Words.  
  
55       Oh! *Marius, Marius* ; wherefore art thou *Marius* ?  (Otway's
Marius.)  
  
56 Nothing is more common than these seeming Contradictions; such as,  

             *Haughty Weakness.*   (Victim.)  
  
             *Great small World* .  (Noah's Flood.)  
  
57 *Lee* hath improv'd this Metaphor.  
  
             *Dost thou not view Joy peeping from my Eyes,  
             The Casements open'd wide to gaze on thee;  
             So* Rome's *glad Citizens to Windows rise,  
             When they some young Triumpher fain would see.*
  (Gloriana.)  
  
58 *Almahide* hath the same Contempt for these Appetites;  
  
             *To eat and drink can no Perfection be* .  (Conquest of
Granada.)  
  
The Earl of *Essex* is of a different Opinion, and seems to place the
chief Happiness of a General therein.  
  
             *Were but Commanders half so well rewarded,  
             Then they might eat.*   (Banks' Earl of Essex.)  
  
But if we may believe one, who knows more than either, the Devil
himself; we shall find Eating to be an Affair of more moment than is
generally imagined.  
  
             *Gods are immortal only by their Food* .  (Lucifer in the
State of Innocence.)  
  
59 This Expression is enough of it self (says Mr. *D------s* ) utterly
to destroy the Character of *Huncamunca* ; yet we find a Woman of no
abandon'd Character in *Dryden* , adventuring farther and thus excusing
her self;  
  
             *To speak our Wishes first, forbid it Pride,  
             forbid it Modesty: True, they forbid it,  
             But Nature does not, when we are athirst,  
             Or hungry, will imperious Nature stay,  
             Nor eat, nor drink, before 'tis bid fall on*
.  (Cleomenes.)  

*Cassandra* speaks before she is asked. *Huncamunca* afterwards.  
*Cassandra* speaks her Wishes to her Lover.  
Huncamunca *only to her Father.*  
  
60             *Her Eyes resistless Magick bear,  
             Angels I see, and Gods are dancing there.*   (Lee's
Sophonisba.)  
  
61 Mr. *Dennis* in that excellent Tragedy, called *Liberty Asserted* ,
which is thought to have given so great a Stroke to the late *French*
King, hath frequent Imitations of this beautiful Speech of King
*Arthur;  
  
             Conquest light'ning in his Eyes, and thund'ring in his
Arm.  
             Joy lighten'd in her Eyes.  
             Joys like Light'ning dart along my Soul* .  
  
62          Jove *with excessive Thund'ring tir'd above,  
             Comes down for Ease, enjoys a Nymph, and then  
             Mounts dreadful, and to Thund'ring goes again.*
  (Gloriana.)  
  
63 This beautiful Line, which ought, says Mr. *W------* to be written in
Gold, is imitated in the New *Sophonisba* ;  
  
             Oh! *Sophonisba, Sophonisba* , oh!  
             Oh! *Narva, Narva* , oh!  
  
The Author of a Song call'd Duke upon Duke, hath improv'd it.  
  
             *Alas! O* Nick, *O* Nick, *alas!*  
  
Where, by the help of a little false Spelling, you have two Meanings in
the repeated Words.  
  
64 *Edith* , in the *Bloody Brother* , speaks to her Lover in the same
familiar Language.  
  
             *Your Grace is full of Game* .  
  
65      *        Traverse the glitt'ring Chambers of the Sky,  
             Born on a Cloud in view of Fate I'll lie,  
             And press her Soul while Gods stand wishing by.*
  (Hannibal.)  
  
66             *Let the four Winds from distant Corners meet,  
             And on their Wings first bear it into* France;  
             *Then back again to* Edina's *proud Walls,  
             Till Victim to the Sound th' aspiring City falls.*
  (Albion Queens.)  
  
67 I do not remember any Metaphors so frequent in the Tragick Poets as
those borrow'd from Riding Post;  
  
             *The Gods and Opportunity ride Post* .  (Hannibal.)  
  
             *-- Let's rush together,  
             For Death rides Post.*   (Duke of Guise.)  
  
             *Destruction gallops to thy murther Post* .  (Gloriana.)  
  
68 This Image too very often occurs;  
  
             -- *Bright as when thy Eye  
             'First lighted up our Loves* .  (Aurengzebe.)  
  
             *This not a Crown alone lights up my Name* .  (Busiris.)  
  
69 There is great Dissension among the Poets concerning the Method of
making Man. One tells his Mistress that the Mold she was made in being
lost, Heaven cannot form such another. *Lucifer* in *Dryden* , gives a
merry Description of his own Formation;  
  
             *Whom Heaven neglecting, made and scarce design'd,  
             But threw me in for Number to the rest.*   (State of
Innocence.)  
  
In one Place, the same Poet supposes Man to be made of Metal;  
  
             *I was form'd  
             Of that coarse Metal, which when she was made,  
             The Gods threw by for Rubbish.*   (All for Love.)  
  
In another, of Dough;  
  
             *When the Gods moulded up the Paste of Man,  
             Some of their Clay was left upon their Hands,  
             And so they made* Egyptians.  (Cleomenes.)  

In another of Clay;  
  
             *-- Rubbish of remaining Clay* .  (Sebastian.)  
  
One makes the Soul of Wax;  
  
             *Her waxen Soul begins to melt apace.*   (Anna Bullen.)  
  
Another of Flint;  
  
             *Sure our two Souls have somewhere been acquainted  
             In former Beings, or struck out together,  
             One Spark to* Africk *flew, and one to*
Portugal.  (Sebastian.)  
  
To omit the great Quantities of Iron, Brazen and Leaden Souls which are
so plenty in modern Authors -- I cannot omit the Dress of a Soul as we
find it in *Dryden;  
  
             Souls shirted but with Air* .  (King Arthur.)  
  
Nor can I pass by a particular sort of Soul in a particular sort of
Description, in the New *Sophonisba.  
  
             Ye mysterious Powers,  
             -- Whether thro' your gloomy Depths I wander,  
             Or on the Mountains walk; give me the calm,  
             The steady smiling Soul, where Wisdom sheds  
             Eternal Sun-shine, and eternal Joy* .  
  
70 This Line Mr. *Banks* has plunder'd entire in his *Anna Bullen* .  
  
71      *        Good Heaven, the Book of Fate before me lay,  
             But to tear out the Journal of that Day.  
             Or if the Order of the World below,  
             Will not the Gap of one whole Day allow,  
             Give me that Minute when she made her Vow* .  (Conquest of
Granada.)  
  
72 I know some of the Commentators have imagined, that Mr. *Dryden* , in
the *Altercative* Scene between *Cleopatra* and *Octavia* , a Scene
which Mr. *Addison* inveighs against with great Bitterness, is much
beholden to our Author. How just this their Observation is, I will not
presume to determine.  
  
73 A cobling Poet indeed, says Mr. *D* . and yet I believe we may find
as monstrous Images in the Tragick-Authors: I'll put down one;  
  
             *Untie your folded Thoughts, and let them dangle loose as
a  
             Bride's Hair* .  (Injur'd Love.)  
  
Which Lines seem to have as much Title to a Milliner's Shop, as our
Author's to a Shoemaker's.  
  
74 Mr. *L------* takes occasion in this Place to commend the great Care
of our Author to preserve the Metre of Blank Verse, in which
*Shakespear, Johnson* and *Fletcher* were so notoriously negligent; and
the Moderns, in Imitation of our Author, so laudably observant;  
  
             *-- Then does  
             Your Majesty believe that he can be  
             A Traitor!*   (Earl of Essex.)  
  
Every Page of *Sophonisba* gives us Instances of this Excellence.  
  
75      *        Love mounts and rowls about my stormy Mind.*
  (Aurengzebe.)  
  
             *Tempests and Whirlwinds thro' my Bosom move.*   (Cleom.)  
  
76              *With such a furious Tempest on his Brow,  
             As if the World's four Winds were pent within  
             His blustring Carcase.*   (Anna Bullen.)  
  
77 Verba Tragica.  
  
78 This Speech hath been terribly maul'd by the Poets.  
  
79              *-- My Life is worn to Rags;  
             Not worth a Prince's wearing* .  (Love Triumph.)  
  
80              *Must I beg the Pity of my Slave?  
             Must a King beg! But Love's a greater King,  
             A Tyrant, nay a Devil that possesses me.  
             He tunes the Organ of my Voice and speaks,  
             Unknown to me, within me.*   (Sebastian.)  
  
81             *When thou wer't form'd, Heaven did a Man begin;  
             But a Brute Soul by chance was shuffled in.*
  (Aurengzebe.)  
  
82               *-- I am a Multitude,  
             Of walking Griefs.*   (New Sophonisba.)  
  
83               *I will take thy Scorpion Blood,  
             And lay it to my Grief till I have Ease.*   (Anna
Bullen.)  
  
84 Our Author, who every where shews his great Penetration into human
Nature, here outdoes himself: Where a less judicious Poet would have
raised a long Scene of whining Love. He who understood the Passions
better, and that so violent an Affection as this must be too big for
Utterance, chooses rather to send his Characters off in this sullen and
doleful manner: In which admirable Conduct he is imitated by the Author
of the justly celebrated *Eurydice* . Dr. *Young* seems to point at this
Violence of Passion;  
  
             *-- Passion choaks  
             Their Words, and they're the Statues of Despair* .  

And *Seneca* tells us, *Curaeleves Loquuntur, ingentes stupent* . The
Story of the *Egyptian* King in *Herodotus* is too well known to need to
be inserted; I refer the more curious Reader to the excellent *Montagne*
, who hath written an Essay on this Subject.  
  
85     *         To part is Death --  
             -- 'Tis Death to part.  
             -- Ah.  
             -- Oh.*   (Don Carlos.)  
  
86     *        Nor know I whether,  
             What am I, who or where,*   (Busiris.)  
  
             *I was I know not what, and am I know not how.*
  (Gloriana.)  
  
87 To understand sufficiently the Beauty of this Passage, it will be
necessary that we comprehend every Man to contain two Selfs. I shall not
attempt to prove this from Philosophy, which the Poets make so plainly
evident.  
   One runs away from the other;  
  
             *Let me demand your Majesty,  
             Why fly you from your self?*   (Duke of Guise.)  
  
In a *2d.* One Self is a Guardian to the other;  
  
             *Leave me the Care of me* .  (Conquest of Granada.)  
  
Again,   *My self am to my self less near* .  (Ibid.)  
  
In the same, the first Self is proud of the second;  
  
             *I my self am proud of me* .  (State of Innocence.)  
  
In a *3d.* Distrustful of him;  
  
             *Fain I would tell, but whisper it in mine Ear,  
             That none besides might hear, nay not my self* .  (Earl of
Essex.)  
  
In a *4th.* Honours him;  
  
             *I honour* Rome,  
             *But honour too my self* .  (Sophonisba.)  
  
In a *5th.* At Variance with him;  
  
             *Leave me not thus at Variance with my self*
.  (Busiris.)  
  
Again, in a *6th.  
  
             I find my self divided from my self.*   (Medea.)  
  
             *She seemed the sad Effigies of her self.*   (Albion
Queens.)  
  
             *Assist me,* Zulema, *if thou would'st be  
             The Friend thou seemest, assist me against me* .  
  
From all which it appears, that there are two Selfs; and therefore *Tom
Thumb's* losing himself is no such Solecism as it hath been represented
by Men, rather ambitious of Criticizing, than qualify'd to Criticize.  
  
88 Mr. *F-----* imagines this Parson to have been a *Welsh* one from his
Simile.  
  
89 Our Author hath been plunder'd here according to Custom;  
  
             *Great Nature* break thy Chain *that links together,  
             The Fabrick of the World and make a* Chaos,  
             *Like that within my Soul* .  (Love Triumphant.)  
  
             *-- Startle Nature, unfix the Globe,  
             And hurl it from its* Axle-tree and Hinges.  (Albion
Queens.)  
  
             *The tott'ring Earth seems sliding off its Props.*  
  
90      *    D------n your delay, ye Torturers proceed,  
             I will not hear one Word but* Almahide.  (Conq. of
Granada.)  
  
91 Mr. *Dryden* hath imitated this in *All for Love* .  
  
92 This Miltonick Stile abounds in the New *Sophonisba* .  
  
             *-- And on her ample Brow  
             Sat Majesty* .  
  
93      *    Your ev'ry Answer, still so ends in that,  
             You force me still to answer you* Morat.  (Aurengzebe.)  
  
94         Morat, Morat, Morat, *You love the Name* .  (Aurengzebe.)  
  
95 Here is a Sentiment for the Virtuous *Huncamunca* (says Mr.
*D------s* ) and yet with the leave of this great Man, the Virtuous
*Panthea* in *Cyrus* , hath an Heart every whit as Ample;  
  
             *For two I must confess are Gods to me,  
             Which is my* Abradatus *first, and thee.*   (Cyrus the
Great.)  
  
Nor is the Lady in *Love Triumphant* more reserv'd, tho' not so
intelligible;  
  
             *-- I am so divided,  
             That I grieve most for both, and love both most.*  
  
96 A ridiculous Supposition to any one, who considers the great and
extensive Largeness of Hell, says a Commentator: But not so to those who
consider the great Expansion of immaterial Substance. Mr. *Banks* makes
one Soul to be so expanded that Heaven could not contain it;  
  
             *The Heavens are all too narrow for her Soul* .  (Virtue
Betray'd.)  
  
The *Persian Princess* hath a Passage not unlike the Author of this;  
  
             *We will send such Shoals of murther'd Slaves,  
             Shall glut Hell's empty Regions* .  
  
This threatens to fill Hell even tho' it were empty; Lord *Grizzle* only
to fill up the Chinks, supposing the rest already full.  
  
97 Mr. *Addisoin* is generally thought to have had this Simile in his
Eye, when he wrote that beautiful one at the end of the third Act of his
*Cato* .  
  
98 This beautiful simile is founded on a Proverb, which does Honour to
the *English* Language;  
  
             *Between two Stools the Breech falls to the Ground.*  
  
I am not so pleased with any written Remains of the Ancients, as with
those little Aphorisms, which verbal Tradition hath delivered down to
us, under the Title of Proverbs. It were to be wished that instead of
filling their Pages with the fabulous Theology of the Pagans, our modern
Poets would think it worth their while to enrich their Works with the
Proverbial Sayings of their Ancestors. Mr. *Dryden* hath chronicl'd one
in Heroick;  
  
             *Two ifs scarce make one Possibility* .  (Conquest of
Granada.)  
  
My Lord *Bacon* is of Opinion, that whatever is known of Arts and
Sciences might be proved to have lurked in the Proverbs of *Solomon* . I
am of the same Opinion in relation to those abovemention'd: At least I
am confident that a more perfect System of Ethicks, as well as Oeconomy,
might be compiled out of them, than is at present extant, either in the
Works of the Antient Philosophers, or those more valuable, as more
voluminous, ones of the modern Divines.  
  
99 Of all the Particulars in which the modern Stage falls short of the
ancient, there is none so much to be lamented, as the great Scarcity of
Ghosts in the latter. Whence this proceeds, I will not presume to
determine. Some are of opinion, that the Moderns are unequal to that
sublime Language which a Ghost ought to speak. One says ludicrously,
That Ghosts are out of Fashion; another, That they are properer for
Comedy; forgetting, I suppose, that *Aristotle* hath told us, That a
Ghost is the Soul of Tragedy; for so I render the which M. *Dacier* ,
amongst others, hath mistaken; I suppose mis-led, by not understanding
the *Fabula* of the *Latins* , which signifies a *Ghost* as well as a
*Fable* .  
  
             *-- Te premet nox, fabulaeque Manes*   (Hor.)  
  
Of all the Ghosts that have ever appeared on the Stage, a very learned
and judicious foreign Critick, gives the Preference to this of our
Author. These are his Words, speaking of this Tragedy;  
  
*-- Nec quidquam in illâ admirabilius quam Phasma quoddam horrendum,
quod omnibus aliis Spectris, quibuscum scatet Anglorum Tragaedia, longè
(pace D ------ isii V. Doctiss. dixerim) praetulerim.*  
  
100 We have already given Instances of this Figure.  
  
101 *Almanzor* reasons in the same manner;  
  
             *-- A Ghost I'll be,  
             And from a Ghost, you know, no Place is free.*   (Conq. of
Granada.)  
  
102 *The Man who writ this wretched Pun* (says (Mr. *D.* ) *would have
picked your Pocket:* Which he proceeds to shew, not only bad in it self,
but doubly so on so solemn an Occasion. And yet in that excellent Play
of *Liberty Asserted* , we find something very much resembling a Pun in
the Mouth of a Mistress, who is parting with the Lover she is fond of;  
  
Ul.              *Oh, mortal Woe! one Kiss, and then farewel.*  
Irene.          *The Gods have given to others to fare well.  
                   O miserably must* Irene *fare.  
  
Agamemnon* , in the *Victim* , is full as facetious on the most solemn
Occasion, that of Sacrificing his Daughter;  
  
             *Yes, Daughter, yes; you will assist the Priest;  
             Yes, you must offer up your -- Vows for* Greece.  
  
103    *    I'll pull thee backwards by thy Shrowd to Light,  
             Or else, I'll squeeze thee, like a Bladder, there,  
             And make thee groan thy self away to Air.*   (Conquest of
Granada.)  
  
             *Snatch me, ye Gods, this Moment into Nothing.*   (Cyrus
the Great.)  
  
104   *  * *  *   *So, art thou gone? Thou canst no Conquest boast,  
             I thought what was the Courage of a Ghost* .  (Conquest of
Granada.)  
  
King *Arthur* seems to be as brave a Fellow as *Almanzor* , who says
most heroically,  
  
             *-- In spight of Ghosts, I'll on.*  
  
105 The Ghost of *Lausaria* in *Cyrus* is a plain Copy of this, and is
therefore worth reading.  
  
             *Ah* , Cyrus!  
             *Thou may'st as well grasp Water, or fleet Air,  
             As think of touching my immortal Shade.*   (Cyrus the
Great.)  
  
106   *Thou better Part of heavenly Air.*   (Conquest of Granada.)  
  
107 *A String of Similies* (says one) *proper to be hung up in the
Cabinet of a Prince* .  
  
108 This Passage hath been understood several different Ways by the
Commentators. For my part, I find it difficult to understand it at all.
Mr. *Dryden* says,  
  
             *I have heard something how two Bodies meet,  
             But how two Souls join, I know not.*  
  
So that 'till the Body of a Spirit be better understood, it will be
difficult to understand how it is possible to run him through it.  
  
109 *Cydaria* is of the same fearful Temper with *Dollallolla* ;  
  
             *I never durst in Darkness be alone.*   (Ind. Emp.)  
  
110       *Think well of this, think that, think every way.*
  (Sophonisba.)  
  
111 These Quotations are more usual in the Comick, than in the Tragick
Writers.  
  
112 *This Distress* (says Mr. *D------* ) *I must allow to be extremely
beautiful, and tends to heighten the virtuous Character of* Dollallolla,
*who is so exceeding delicate, that she is in the highest Apprehension
from the inanimate Embrace of a Bolster. An Example worthy of Imitation
from all our Writers of Tragedy* .  
  
113 *Credat Judaeus Apelles.  
Non ego* -- (Says Mr. *D.* ) -- *For, passing over the Absurdity of
being equal to Odds, can we possibly suppose a little insignificant
Fellow - I say again, a little insignificant Fellow able to vie with a
Strength which all the* Sampsons *and* Hercules's *of Antiquity would be
unable to encounter.*  
  
I shall refer this incredulous Critick to Mr. *Dryden's* Defence of his
*Almanzor* ; and lest that should not satisfy him, I shall quote a few
Lines from the Speech of a much braver Fellow than *Almanzor* , Mr.
*Johnson's Achilles;  
  
             Tho'* Human Race rise in embattel'd Hosts,  
             *To force her from my Arms -- Oh! Son of* Atreus!  
             *By that immortal Pow'r, whose deathless Spirit  
             Informs this Earth,* I will oppose them all.  (Victim.)  
  
114 *I have heard of being supported by a Staff* (says Mr. *D.* ) *but
never of being supported by an Helmet* . I believe he never heard of
Sailing with Wings, which he may read in no less a Poet than Mr.
*Dryden* ;  
  
             *Unless we borrow Wings, and sail thro' Air.*   (Love
Triumphant.)  
  
What will he say to a kneeling Valley?  
  
             *-- I'll stand  
             Like a safe Valley, that low bends the Knee,  
             To some aspiring Mountain.*   (Injur'd Love.)  
  
I am asham'd of so ignorant a Carper, who doth not know that an Epithet
in Tragedy is very often no other than an Expletive. Do not we read in
the New *Sophonisba* of *grinding Chains, blue Plagues, white Occasions*
, and *blue Serenity* ? Nay, 'tis not the Adjective only, but sometimes
half a Sentence is put by way of Expletive, as, *Beauty pointed high
with Spirit* , in the same Play -- and, *In the Lap of Blessing, to be
most curst* , in the Revenge.  
  
115    *  * *  * A Victory like that of *Almanzor* .  
             Almanzor *is victorious without Fight* .  (Conq. of
Granada.)  
  
116    *    Well have we chose an happy Day for Fight,  
             For every Man in course of Time has found,  
             Some Days are lucky, some unfortunate* .  (K. Arthur.)  
  
117 We read of such another in *Lee;  
  
             Teach his rude Wit a Flight she never made,  
             And sent her Post to the* Elysian *Shade.*   (Gloriana.)  
  
118 These Lines are copied *Verbatim* in the *Indian Emperor* .  
  
119    *  * *  * *Unborn Thunder rolling in a Cloud.*   (Conq. of
Gran.)  
  
120    *    Were Heaven and Earth in wild Confusion hurl'd,  
             Should the rash Gods unhinge the rolling World,  
             Undaunted, would I tread the tott'ring Ball,  
             Crush'd, but unconquer'd, in the dreadful Fall.*   (Female
Warrior.)  
  
121 See the History of *Tom Thumb* , pag. 2.  
  
122    *  * *  * *-- Amazement swallows up my Sense,  
             And in th' impetuous Whirl of circling Fate,  
             Drinks down my Reason.  (Pers.* Princess.)  
  
123   *  * *  *   *-- I have outfaced my self,  
             What! am I two? Is there another Me?*   (K. Arthur.)  
  
124 The Character of *Merlin* is wonderful throughout, but most so in
this Prophetick Part. We find several of these Prophecies in the Tragick
Authors, who frequently take this Opportunity to pay a Compliment to
their Country, and sometimes to their Prince. None but our Author (who
seems to have detested the least Appearance of Flattery) would have past
by such an Opportunity of being a Political Prophet.  
  
125    *I saw the Villain,* Myron, *with these Eyes I saw him*
.  (Busiris.)  
  
In both which Places it is intimated, that it is sometimes possible to
see with other Eyes than your own.  
  
126 *This Mustard* (says Mr. *D.* ) *is enough to turn one's Stomach: I
would be glad to know what Idea the Author had in his Head when he wrote
it* . This will be, I believe, best explained by a Line of Mr. *Dennis*
;  
  
             *And gave him Liberty, the Salt of Life* .  (Liberty
asserted.)  
  
The Understanding that can digest the one, will not rise at the other.  
  
127       Han. *Are you the Chief, whom Men fam'd* Scipio *call?*  
             Scip. *Are you the much more famous* Hannibal?  (Hannib.)  
  
128 Dr. *Young* seems to have copied this Engagement in his *Busiris*
:  
  
             Myr. *Villain!*  
             Mem. Myron!  
             Myr. *Rebel!*  
             Mem. Myron!  
*            * Myr. *Hell!*  
*            * Mem. Mandane  
  
129 This last Speech of my Lord *Grizzle* , hath been of great Service
to our Poets;  
  
             *-- I'll hold it fast  
             As Life, and when Life's gone, I'll hold this last;  
             And if thou tak'st it from me when I'm slain,  
             I'll send my Ghost, and fetch it back again* .  (Conquest
of Granada.)  
  
130    *    My Soul should with such Speed obey,  
             It should not bait at Heaven to stop its way* .  
  
*Lee* seems to have had this last in his Eye;  
  
             *'Twas not my Purpose, Sir, to tarry there,  
             I would but go to Heaven to take the Air* .  (Gloriana.)  
  
131    *    A rising* Vapour rumbling *in my Brains* .  (Cleomenes.)  
  
132    *  * *  * *Some kind Spright knocks softly at my Soul,  
             To tell me Fate's at Hand* .  
  
133 Mr. *Dryden* seems to have had this Simile in his Eye, when he
says,  
  
             *My Soul is* packing up, *and just on Wing* .  (Conquest of
Granada.)  
  
134    *  * *  * *And in a purple Vomit pour'd his Soul.*
  (Cleomenes.)  
  
135    *    The Devil swallows vulgar Souls  
             Like whipp'd Cream* .  (Sebastian.)  
  
136    *    How I could curse my Name of* Ptolemy!  
             *It is so long, it asks an Hour to write it.  
             By Heav'n! I'll change it into* Jove, *or* Mars,  
             *Or any other civil Monosyllable,  
             That will not tire my Hand* .  (Cleomenes.)  
  
137 Here is a visible Conjunction of two Days in one, by which our
Author may have either intended an Emblem of a Wedding; or to insinuate,
that Men in the Honey-Moon are apt to imagine time shorter than it is.
It brings into my Mind a Passage in the Comedy call'd the *Coffee-House
Politician* ;  
  
             *We will celebrate this Day at my House To-morrow* .  
  
138 These beautiful Phrases are all to be found in one single Speech of
*King Arthur* , or *The British Worthy* .  
  
139    *  * *  * *I was but teaching him to grace his Tale  
             With decent Horror* .  (Cleomenes.)  
  
140 We may say with *Dryden,  
  
             Death did at length so many Slain forget,  
             And left the Tale, and took them by the Great* .  
  
I know of no Tragedy which comes nearer to this charming and bloody
Catastrophe, than *Cleomenes* , where the Curtain covers five principal
Characters dead on the Stage. These Lines too,  
  
             *I ask no Questions then, of Who kill'd Who?  
             The Bodies tell the Story as they lie.*  
  
seem to have belonged more properly to this Scene of our Author. -- Nor
can I help imagining they were originally his. The Rival Ladies too seem
beholden to this Scene;  
  
             *We're now a Chain of Lovers link'd in Death,  
            * Julia *goes first* , Gonsalvo *hangs on her,  
             And* Angelina *hangs upon* Gonsalvo,  
             *As I on* Angelina.  
  
No Scene, I believe, ever received greater Honours than this. It was
applauded by several *Encores* , a Word very unusual in Tragedy -- And
it was very difficult for the Actors to escape without a second
Slaughter. This I take to be a lively Assurance of that fierce Spirit of
Liberty which remains among us, and which Mr. *Dryden* in his *Essay* on
*Dramatick Poetry* hath observed -- *Whether Custom* (says he) *hath so
insinuated it self into our Countrymen, or Nature hath so formed them to
Fierceness, I know not, but they will scarcely suffer Combats, and other
Objects of Horror, to be taken from them* . -- And indeed I am for
having them encouraged in this Martial Disposition: Nor do I believe our
Victories over the *French* have been owing to any thing more than to
those bloody Spectacles daily exhibited in our Tragedies, of which the
*French* Stage is so entirely clear.
