An Arthurian Miscellany at Intangible Textual Heritage

## THE LAST LOVE OF GAWAINE

### by

## RICHARD HOVEY

  
  
You will betray me--oh, deny it not!  
What right have I, alas, to say you nay?  
I, traitor of ten loves, what shall I say  
To plead with you that I be not forgot?  
My love has not been squandered jot by jot  
In little loves that perish with the day.  
My treason has been ever to the sway  
Of queens; my faith has known no petty blot.  
You will betray me, as I have betrayed,  
And I shall kiss the hand that does me wrong.  
And oh, not pardon--I need pardon more--  
But in proud torment, grim and unafraid,  
Burn in my hell nor cease the bitter song  
Your beauty triumphs in forevermore.
