## SIR DAGONET'S QUEST

### by

## F. B. MONEY-COUTTS

  
  
I  
King Mark came riding, in great despite,  
Seeking Sir Tristram to slay,  
And chanced on a merry and courteous knight,  
But knew him not for that jesting wight  
Sir Dinadan, brave and gay.  
  
II  
As saddle to saddle they paced along,  
Hoving afar they saw  
Horses and knights in a gallant throng  
Under the forest shaw.  
  
III  
Said Dinadan, "Lo! by yon cloth of gold  
Launcelot rides this way!"  
And Mark, like a man that shakes with cold,  
Said, "Launcelot here? Then I cannot hold  
Longer with you today!"  
  
IV  
When Dinadan spied he might scarce abide  
For terror, he cried, "I see  
Sir Launcelot's shield! On a silver field  
Three lions and lilies three!"  
  
V  
But he said it to shape a jest and jape,  
That cowardly King to school;  
For lions and lilies emblazoned thrice  
He wist full well were the new device  
Of Dagonet, Arthur's fool.  
  
VI  
Now Mark had turned him about, to slip  
Back, like a snake, for fear;  
But Dinadan rode to his fellowship,  
Who made of him passing cheer.  
  
VII  
He told them his craft and all agreed;  
So Dagonet, armed to fight,  
Adventured his spear and spurred at speed,  
Crying, "Ho! ye caitiff of Cornish breed !  
Keep ye, ye craven knight!"  
  
VIII  
Now out, now in, through thick and through thin,  
Mark fled from that shield aghast;  
Through thick and through thin, with dindle and din,  
Sir Dagonet followed fast!  
  
IX  
Then the knights chased after, with Ho! and Yield!  
And he ran like a rated hound;  
And the cry rose high and the laughter pealed,  
Till wood and water and forest and field  
Rang with the noise and sound.
