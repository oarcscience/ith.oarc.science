C. C.</h2>  </center>  <br>  The night is here, and thou art with me still,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved one, although beyond the reach of hands<br>  Eager to clasp thee; and I long to fill<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again this soul more dry than desert sands<br>  Now thou art gone, with the deep-flowing streams<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy most gracious prescence.  Soon it will<br>  Return all life-like in the land of dreams.<br>  <br>  How shall our struggling hearts, so many years<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As may perchance be thine and mine, sweet Love,<br>  Out-face this ceaseless storm of hopes and fears,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For aye within us, round, below, above?<br>  Oh ask me not; for whether joy or tears<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain for us, we must bear silently,<br>  Dearest, and with a love that cannot die.<br>  <br>  How do the angels reason of our love?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those blest spirits that are gone before,<br>  Who, now rejoicing in their place above,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked with us on this melancoly shore<br>  Of life, years, years ago; will they forgive<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In us such earth-born folly?  Or once more<br>  Could we with such as they are choose to live?<br>  <br>  Ah weary hearts, encrusted o'er with dross<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught up from this vile world!  Can we be sure,<br>  When of this lower life we suffer loss,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will beat freely in an air so pure,<br>  Fit for the souls who enter into light?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such dross is in the grain; it must endure<br>  Our own, unchanging still, in death's despite.<br>  <br>  But come what will, to the last agony,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My choice is made; I cannot yield thee up.<br>  Dross or pure gold, I give it all to thee.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pearls of all my life shall in thy cup<br>  Be thrown and melted; they are nought to me,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save as they make some bubbling sparkle rise<br>  To see itself one instant in thine eyes.<br>
