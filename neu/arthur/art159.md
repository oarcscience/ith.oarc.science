          Camelford--Camelot

                        I.

Not Camelot the towered--the goodly town   
   Upon the shining rive, whither passed  
   The Lady of Shalott, when fallen at last  
A victim to her spell, slow-wafted down!  
Not Camelot the towered, the glittering crown  
   Of all King Arthur's cities! Yet thou hast  
   Thy legend of the King--how Modred massed  
His traitor legions, where the waters brown  
Run neath the Bridge of Slaughter, how the King,  
   With Launcelot dishonoured, Tristram slain  
And half of his Round-table following  
   Dead or apostate--triumphed; then was ta'en;  
Stricken to death, by bold Sir Bedivere  
To Dozmary and passed upon the mere.

 

          Camelford--Slaughter Bridge

                        II.

In the soft prelude of an August night  
   We sallied forth from Camelford in quest  
   Of where his last great battle in the west  
Brought death to Athur. Grey the gloaming light  
Ere we were in the valley of the fight,  
   A spot by Nature framed for fierce contest,  
   With ridge commanding ridge, and crest on crest,  
On either side a little river, bright  
   With waving sedge and darting trout. The bridge  
      Was wreathed with blackhaired spleenwort and wild flowers,  
   And the rank grass beneath the lowest bridge  
      Guarded a stone, in characters not ours,  
   Claimed by the country-folk with wondering eyes  
   To tell that Arthur underneath it lies.
