## PASTORAL OF GALAHAD

### by

## ELINOR SWEETMAN

  
The blackthorn-flower hath fallen away--  
The blackthorn-flower that wise men say  
Keeps wild and variable skies  
As long as it may stay:  
But here's the gorse, and here's the whin,  
And here the pearlèd may appears,  
And poison-weeds of satin skin  
Through every bank prick long green ears  
To hear the cuckoo-cries.  
  
By early field and coppice dark,  
One cometh singing like the lark;  
His limbs with silver plates are clad  
More bright than beechen-bark;  
And bathed in mist, half sun, half steam,  
The yokels made their clumsy bow,  
Or pull aside their smoking team  
To murmur kneeling in the plough:  
"Here cometh Galahad."  
  
And Galahad hath stayed his song  
To help the labouring hinds along,  
And prayed them, pitying the dumb,  
To spare both goad and thong;  
And blessed them all, and wandered forth  
Through pasture purpled o'er with thyme,  
And cried unto the fragrant earth,  
And louder than the minster chime:  
"Laudate Dominum!"  
  
For earth is soft with summer's dole:  
Each worn-out mare hath got a foal  
To suck her weariness away,  
And make old bruises whole;  
And deep in grass may weaklings rest  
Beside the milky mother-things;  
The starling by his hidden nest  
Like a low sound of bubbling springs  
Chuckles the livelong day.  
  
"I thank Thee, Lord," Sir Galahad said,  
"Thy sinless earth is happy made."  
By day, by night, his thrilling voice  
Ringeth through sun and shade.  
At eve he picks the flowering thorn  
To scourge therewith his shoulders bare;  
The flowers fly off, the flesh is torn,  
Yet ever more he sings in prayer:  
"Rejoice, my heart, rejoice."  
  
Now with the full-leaved Whitsuntide  
The truant knights to Camelot ride,  
That they may keep the festival  
By noble Arthur's side.  
And some are bronzed by wind and sun,  
And some are seamed with blows and care,  
And all are full of speech; but none  
The record of his soul lays bare  
Within that courtly hall.  
  
Eleven at the Table Round  
With gemmy carcanets are crowned:  
The twelfth hath flowers of woodroffe wild  
Around his forehead bound.  
He cometh singing like the lark--  
He entereth gay with garlands green--  
"Art shepherd-clown or chapel-clerk,  
O knight?" said Guinevere the queen  
To Galahad undefiled.  
  
"Why Galahad this joyous mien?  
O Galahad where hast thou been?  
Hath prayed and fasted all the Lent? <sup>1</sup>  
What vision hast thou seen?"  
But Galahad throws his garland down:  
"O king, O knights, no monk am I;  
Nor yet, my queen, a shepherd-clown;  
In wanderings 'neath the open sky  
Mine idle days were spent.  
  
"In grassy ways I set my feet;  
I tuned mine ears to chirp and bleat;  
I saw a sickle-moon at birth  
Over the young green what.  
I sate among the kindly beasts  
And knew them seasonably glad;  
Of balsam-herbs I made my feasts;  
A happier man than Galahad  
Was never seen on earth.  
  
"My heart was glad for that I knew  
The fallen bole had greened anew,  
And sucking things were glad and mad  
And gambolled in the dew;  
For when new leaves come round the bole,  
And every beast hath young unto her,  
O king, within the loneliest soul  
Are silent place all in flower!"  
Answereth Galahad.  
  
"Shame! shame!" cry then the Table Round,  
"What! never a blow, and never a wound?  
And never a holy image kissed  
In crypts beneath the ground?"  
Saith Galahad: "I think no shame;  
The story of the Lord of all  
When first on Christmas night He came  
Beginneth with a pastoral:  
Even your captain, Christ.  
  
"Have ye not heard of ass and ox  
That warmed the stable in the rocks?  
Have ye not read of them that kept  
Night-watches o'er their flocks?  
And shall His humble virgin knight  
With herds and shepherds scorn to dwell,  
If He who leads all heaven's might  
To battle with the crews of hell,  
By beasts of burden slept?  
  
"I am not less a soldier sealed,  
Because in life of tilth and field  
I saw the light, I heard the call,  
That God Himself revealed.  
But king, hast thou a perilous quest,  
And would'st thou doubt which knight to send?  
Mine arm is strong, my heart at rest--  
Behold the man!"  
                         Here hath an end  
Sir Galahad's pastoral.
