## ARTHUR'S KNIGHTING

### by

## SEBASTIAN EVANS

  
  
I mind me of Toraise in Carmelide:--  
Plenary court with show and festival  
Held King Leodegan that Whitsuntide.  
By noon the busy cooks had served in hall  
Pottage of herbs with spiceries and wine,  
Boars' heads in aigredouce and therewithal  
Herons and egrets in sauce Gamelyne,  
Peacocks in pride in platters of pure gold,  
And swans in silver served with galentine,  
Bakemeats and venison and a store untold  
Of savoury breads, and flesh, and fowl, and fish,  
Sallets and mortrews, fritters hot and cold,  
Creams, cates, and jellies, many a lordly dish  
Of pear and pippin, comfit-carraways,  
Citron and dates--a Cardinal could wish  
No fairer garnish on his holy days.  
And after every course the Sewer arrayed  
A subtle fancy of Dame Fortune's ways:  
First, Belisaire upon his throne displayed;  
Next, the blind lazar cowering by the wall;  
The third, in tattered weed, a beggar-maid;  
And last, Cophetua's bride in crown and pall.  
Dame Fortune's self the while, in midmost place,  
Poising her gilded limbs on her swift ball  
Above the mast-head, with a silken lace  
Bare up the mainsail of an argosy  
Of beaten silver, that in hypocras  
Swam idly, all becalmed in a Red Sea,  
Among the isles of wafer-cake in sop.  
  
And fair aloft, the minstrel-gallery  
A ceilure starred with gold did overtop:  
And ever among, the quire or played or sang  
With citole, sackbut, sawtrey, and sweet stop  
Of clariner and cornet, and the clang  
Of timbrels and of tabors--pipe and lute  
With their wild warble thrilling through the twang  
Of harps and wail of melancholy flute.  
To that high music every heart beat high  
With knightly passion, and when all was mute,  
The young men did not think it much to die;  
And greybeards knew that their old blood was young,  
And looked upon the young men with a sigh.  
Then forward stood a chorister and flung  
Such sweet, sweet sorrow into his sweet lay  
Of lovers' woe, that, ere the song was sung,  
There was no warrior's eye but turned away  
Lest it should meet his fellow's for the tear.  
  
Ginevra looked at Arthur, but the grey  
Of her bright eyne knew nought of lover's fear;  
And when they met not his, the rebel blood  
Flushed to the fair tip of her tingling ear,  
As there before him teeth on lip she stood,  
For that she knew she showed so beautiful  
In the wild triumph of that sovran mood,  
And grudged that he should see not. Was he dull,  
And drank that philtre of sweet sound in vain,  
That thus he looked away, nor cared to lull  
The divine longing of love's hunger-pain  
By feeding in her eyes his love with love?  
He saw not,--no! Nor, though he stared amain,  
Saw he the banners blazoned bright above  
The starry ceilure. Not until the stir  
After the song, when all the guests 'gan move,  
Did her true lover think to look at her.  
  
And then, pardie, her eyes were otherwhere:  
For lo, past truncheoned steward and cellarer  
Who stood beside the cupboard, mazed with care  
Of the great goblets and the cups of state,  
Limped Tronc the jester, with a Kaiser's air,  
His kingly train upborne by an ape sedate,  
And four white poodles, two on either side,  
Marching upright, but sad, as if the fate  
Of courtier-life bore hardly on their pride,  
And those gay silken masquer weeds they wore  
Repaid not half what they must needs abide  
As hangers-on to majesty so poor.  
Long laughter shook the hall at that strange show,  
Which waxed amain when on the lower floor  
The motley knave, with many a mop and mow,  
Bade all his four-foot courtiers dance and leap,  
Just as a king might bid his dukes do so.  
The feasters laughed and drank, and they drank deep  
Of those tall flagons, and the butler's wand  
Waved for fresh vintage with a lordly sweep.  
  
Ginevra raught a wine-flask from the stand  
Brimmed with the ripest, and at Arthur's knee  
Knelt, a deep beaker in her dainty hand,  
Gemmed all within with jewels that make flee  
All taint and venom from the faery brim,  
And humbly proffered her new lord. But he,  
Shamed that such service should be done to him  
By her who was his worship, bade her rise.  
"Nay," quoth the Sire, "fair knight, in life and limb  
We are all thine--Let be, the girl is wise."  
Then Arthur drank and gave her back the cup;  
But still she knelt beside him, and her eyes  
Betrayed no signal as she raised them up  
Of woman's art in the child's artlessness,  
As if she wondered how her lord should sup.  
  
Yet inly knew she all her loveliness:  
The pilch of velvet, parted white and blue,  
Reversed with ermines for an emperess,  
All overt on the sides, where shimmered through  
The kirtle's silken warp with weft of gold  
From looms of Baldack--O, full well she knew  
The needled broidery wrought on every fold--  
Those smiling suns above and sunflowers three  
Under each sun, with faces broad and bold  
Staring upon him through their greenery  
Of sheeny leafage; all along the hem  
*A rienz plus bas jeo ne me tourne mie*  
Figured in umber, and on every stem  
*Solleil m'attire* on scroll of argent grain--  
The glistening girdle brooched with pearl and gem,  
The gipciere silver-guarded and its chain,  
The coronal of gold and golden net--  
Full well she knew she wore them not in vain,  
But knew no less herself was mightier yet.  
The joyous witchcraft of her sunny hair,  
The spell of eyes that dimmed the eyes they met,  
Even the sigh that half betrayed how fair  
The rosy promise of the imperial breast,  
Guising an art to tell how, pillowed there,  
Her love, the sovran of the world, might rest  
In empire sweeter than the sway of kings.  
So, for the night was waxing, host and guest  
Betook them to their chambers, and the things  
Which showed so mighty faded while they slept  
Utterly even as fond imaginings,  
And no man knew that he had laughed or wept.  
But not forgetful of sweet life they lay,  
For each, almost ere midnight tolled, had leapt  
Forth from his couch to busk him for the day.  
  
Then on the dais a carpet of fine Tars  
Was spread in hall, where grooms and pages gay,  
With tapers twinkling under the gold stars,  
Lighted the bare-armed, leathern-aproned band  
Who cased us in our harness for the wars.  
And 'mid the clang, a squire on either hand,  
Came Arthur's self, and on the carpet doffed  
His mantle blue of cloth of Samarcand,  
Unhasped the jewelled girdle, and aloft  
Lifted the velvet coat, and set aside  
The banded shoon of cheveril white and soft.  
Then stately through high hall in seemly pride,  
Among the clashing press, that Peerless One  
Stepped with such gait as might beseem the bride  
Of empire peerless underneath the sun.  
Yet to her lord right maidenly she spake,  
Bidding good morrow: "Nay," quoth she, "by none  
Save mine own hands, sweet Sire, for knighthood's sake  
Shalt thou be armed this day."--With that she set  
Upon the kingly cycladoun of lake  
The hacketon all lined with sarcinet,  
Orfreyed without with crescents of thin gold  
Upon the buckskin; next the solleret  
She fitted on each foot with fold on fold  
Of overlapping steel and toe-piece keen,  
Like scale and sting of hornet; next in hold  
She locked his thews in greaves of damasked sheen  
Of Milan; next the cuisses featously  
She hasped upon his thigh, and fair between  
Buckled the knee-piece underneath the knee;  
Vambrace and brassart next, and elbow-plate  
As squire who knew full well where each should be  
Upon his arms she jointed in due state,  
And shelled the shoulders in their silver scale.  
Then, o'er the pourpoint, heeding not the weight,  
Deftly she donned the jesseraunt of mail;  
And over that, the jupon, blazoned fair  
With fiery dragon swindging his huge tail,  
And broidered bordure, wrought in leafage rare  
Of braided strands of silk incarnadine.  
Then on the golden glory of his hair  
With gentle stedfast hand and earnest eyne,  
As if she offered up a kingly gift  
With solemn pageant at a saintly shrine,  
With arms upstretched before him did she lift  
The bascinet all burnished, rich inlaid  
With golden damask, then with fingers swift  
Made fast the fringe of camail fair displayed;  
Drew on the gauntlets with their gadlings gilt  
And tasseled hems with knotted silk arrayed;  
And kneeling then, the spurs he won in tilt  
On the first day he armed him, on his heel  
She set and buckled. Deftly thus she built  
Around her love that sheeny tower of steel.--  
But more was wanting. Still upon one knee  
Beside her new lord did the proud one kneel,  
And from the blushing page took reverently  
The faery wonder of Escalibor  
With all its wealth of jewelled wizardry  
Wherewith to gird her knightly bachelor:  
Baldrick and hilt and scabbard--not a gem  
But flashed with virtue for a conqueror:--  
This ruby once on Judith's diadem  
Blazed like a star--that diamond clasp of yore  
Girdled the Wise King in Jerusalem:  
Yet all not worthier than the blade they bore,  
Forged in the caverns of the Enchanted Lake  
By Weland, snapped and forged again thrice o'er,  
Graven with names whereat the foul fiends quake  
In potent rune and mystic sign enscrolled;  
Then for the first time did the fair hand shake,  
Yet tongued the buckle smoothly on the fold  
And the rich ends in a loose knot let fall.  
  
So rose she, proudly smiling to behold  
Her knight and king, how comely and how tall  
He showed in that fair labour of her hand.  
Yea, and beside her others smiled in hall;  
For watching the sweet pair anigh did stand  
Her sire and Merlin, with such thoughts as stir  
Old hearts at sight of young love, 'mid a band  
Of gaping losels, page and armourer.  
  
Then spake old Merlin with his sour-sweet smile,  
By name to Arthur, but as much to her:--  
"Fair sir, in Logress, in the minster-aisle  
Of sweet Saint Stephen erst thou didst receive  
At pious Dubric's hand the name and style  
Of a true knight, but now thou wouldst achieve  
A dearer honour--now almost 'tis thine  
To be love-knighted. By this lady's leave  
One thing alone is lacking."--Her full eyne  
Ginevra flashed upon that wizard grey,  
As Arthur asked: "What lacketh, master mine?  
No rite shall fail my chivalry this day  
From whence I date my knighthood, for till this  
I have but jested." Then quoth Merlin: "Nay,  
'Tis but a trifle--let the lady kiss,  
And thou, fair sir, art knight for evermore!"  
"Sweet Sire," quoth she, "King Arthur shall not miss  
For gift so small his knighthood. If my lore  
Be nothing in this matter, pardon me:  
Yet as to kisses, I am not so poor  
That I can spare none." Then full maidenly  
Her rosy lips she lifted to her lord  
And kissed him in all stateliness; but he  
Caught her in both arms and without a word  
Repaid the kiss thrice o'er and thrice to boot.  
O, but no rune nor gem on belt nor sword  
Could stay the trembling that from head to foot  
Shook the new knight in that encounter sweet,  
No harness ward the wound from his heart's root.  
So kissed those lovers. Fleet and few, how fleet,  
How few, from the first cradle to the last,  
Those high eternal moments! O, the beat  
Within their pulses made our own beat fast  
And dimmed our eyes with pity and regret.  
Or do we now grow old, and fondly cast  
A sadness on the joy we half forget,  
Clouding with sorrows of our eld the youth  
We do remember to remember yet?  
We know not now. But even thus in sooth  
Those lovers kissed, and we who saw them kiss  
Look back and see them still with such deep ruth  
As maketh old men weep at sight of bliss;--  
Still feel the whisper which we could not hear:  
"All eyes are staring--loose me after this."  
So slipped she from his arms with gracious cheer,  
Ruddy for maiden shame, yet not the less  
Proud, not alone of her own knight sans peer,  
But proud that all should see that fond caress.  
Then Arthur turned as one but half awake,  
Drunken with that deep draught of loveliness,  
Dazed with his dreams of conquest for her sake  
And bliss to be. But when his eye did light  
On her sad-smiling sire, a flush 'gan break  
Into his brow, with love's own wanness white;  
And when beyond he felt the glittering blue  
Of Merlin's eye, he crimsoned through outright;  
For well that bridegroom knew that Merlin knew  
His lawless other love and its wild sin--  
Sin unto death, even though all else be true.  
  
But Merlin spake: "Hereafter thou shalt win  
Glory undying, such as never yet  
Was e'er achieved by prince or paladin.  
Yea, there be mighty names that men forget,  
And all our life is but a little space,  
And soon we shall lie still for all our fret.  
Our day is short, and night comes on apace,  
And then we shall not know sorrow nor bliss,  
Nor toil nor rest, nor recollect the face  
Of man nor woman. Yet by that sweet kiss  
To the world's end men shall remember thee!  
They shall remember, yea, and more than this:  
King thou art now, and king again shalt be  
Hereafter in this land of Bloy Bretayne;  
For though thou go away, and shalt be free  
No less than others from the toil and pain,  
Thou shalt not die as others, nor the years  
Shall waste no glory of thy secret reign  
In realm of Faery, whence among thy peers  
Thou shalt return to rule in sight of all  
That shall have eyes to see thee through their tears  
Of joy that after so long interval  
Their own King Arthur doth come back to men."  
  
So Merlin spake, and we, who stood in hall,  
Were mute for musing. But Ginevra then  
As one whom joy and doubt at once o'erwhelm,  
Hearing how he, her lord, should come agen,  
Yet nought of her, the lady of his realm--  
Stepped forth once more and with firm hand did don  
Over the knight's steel cap the kingly helm,  
Windowed and pranked with gold, and thereupon  
A chaplet wrought with leaf of lily and vine,  
Beaten in gold--a Jew's-work pentagon  
Under each foil, inwrought with subtle twine  
Of stones of empire on the sheeny rim.  
Then Merlin came, saying: "The last is mine,"  
And set above the helm a crest to dim  
All gold and gemwork flash they as they might;  
The Dragon-royal, through whose every limb  
The lifeblood beat in pulses of quick light;  
Yet stirred it not, save that its snaky tail  
It curled in glancing folds, and fiery bright  
It breathed a flame, red-mirrored in the mail.  
  
So strode the King full kingly to the gate,  
Where in gay trappings o'er the burnished scale  
Bridged by the saddle, his tall steed did wait  
And neighed to greet his monarch as he strode  
And swung into the stirrups in all state.  
Sadly those lovers each bade each to God;  
For glory is sweet but love is loth to go;  
And through the strait lane clattering forth we rode  
With folded gonfanons and lances low.
