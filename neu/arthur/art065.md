## WHEN TRISTRAM TO TINTAGEL CAME

### by

## CYRIL EMRA

  
When Tristram with his fifty knights  
On a midnight hour  
Back to long Tintagel came,  
Queen Iseult sate watching them  
In the glare of the cresset-lights,  
From her royal tower.  
  
Hurry and hum of hoofs she had heard,  
(Who sooner than she?)  
And the chains in the gateway groaned and stirred,  
Straining heavily;  
And the mighty drawbridge downward swung  
Massive and slow;  
And through the vaulted archway rung  
Voice and tread of steel-girt men,  
When Tristram's knights came home again  
In Cornwall long ago!  
Over the drawbridge came the knights  
Riding together,  
Three abreast,  
With clank of steel and rattle of leather  
And flaunt of many a scarf and crest  
In the windy flare of the dancing lights  
Agleam on shining arms and mail;  
But here and there, as they rode,  
Was a sun-tanned face dead pale, -  
Ay, there was rust and stain of blood,  
And shoulder-high the splash of mud  
When the watchers gave them hail.  
  
'Greet ye well and true, Sir Tristram,  
That ye come back from war!  
Welcome to Cornwall's chivalry!  
And how did ye fare?  
  
'I give ye thanks,' Sir Tristram said,  
'For your brave welcoming.  
We have fought and gotten victory,  
So good news I bring!  
I greet ye well, fair gentlemen.  
And whither is Mark the King?'  
  
'Well is thee for victory,  
Tristram, Sir Knight!  
King Mark went out a-hunting  
To-day at dawn-light;  
And no more cometh he  
Till the third night.'  
  
Then waxed Sir Tristram  
Right wroth with King Mark,  
And bitter his smile was,  
And his face grew dark.  
'A strange thing is this,' said he,  
'That Mark has done! -  
But left he aught word for me?'  
And they told him, 'None!'  
  
'That is an ill thing!' Tristram said,  
'And it grieves me full sore;  
Here win we back with a dozen dead  
And wounded a score, -  
And Mark is out a-hunting gone  
While I fight his war"  
I trow me well, by Godis head,  
It grieves me full sore!'  
  
And here came a lady's lad  
With golden curled hair,  
Desiring of Tristram,  
From Iseult, with courtesies,  
To learn how he fare.  
  
Then made he none else other word,  
But bade his squire to him,  
And did him off his great fell sword  
And his harness hacked and grim,  
And girt him with a chain of gold  
And his long cloak of green,  
And gat him as a gentle knight  
To greet that fair queen.  
  
All alone in her royal chamber  
Iseult watched for him,  
Where she screened candles made her  
A light soft and dim;  
They lit the beauty of her face  
And the glory of her hair:  
There was no maid in Christendom  
Half so wondrous fair.  
  
*'Hail to thee, Tristram, back from thy warfare!  
Home again come again, hero, to me!  
Lone I have waited, fain for thy welfare,  
Longing and praying, dear one, for thee!'  
  
'Yea, I come again, O my belovèd,  
Back to Tintagel, home dear to thee.  
In the red warfare thy will for my welfare,  
Praying, has holpen and comforted me!'  
  
'Comest thou spent from the foemen who pressed thee?'  
'Yea, I am weary with travail of war!'  
'Ah, lay thy head on my bosom and rest thee.'  
'Dear, at thy touch, I am weary no more!'*  
  
He knelt before her knightly-wise  
And kissed her finger-tips;  
She kissed him once on either cheek  
And twice upon the lips.  
'And now,' quoth he, 'is dole on me,  
That I may not abide with thee:  
Iseult, mine own, I pray thee then,  
Think me not graceless if I go,  
For much is now for me to do  
When home again come we;  
And I wis my gallant gentlemen  
Are calling for me!'  
  
'Nay till this candle burn away,'  
She said, 'O tarry thou, -  
And that will be, as well we see,  
Short while enough from now!'  
And Tristram, watching near her, smiled  
As one on whom old memories fall,  
Saying, 'Iseult, art still a child  
In spite of all, in spite of all!'  
And low he sat him at her feet  
And took in his the hand she gave,  
And felt her presence, rare and sweet,  
As ever sway him, till it drave  
From sense and limb the weariness  
Of battle and the road, and lent  
Its lulling magic to caress  
His soul with some divine content.  
  
The pine-log smouldering on the hearth  
Shone through the shaded gloom;  
The flowers on her table thrilled  
With drowsy, faint perfume.  
They talked of battle and the chase,  
They spake of life and love,  
So that they saw no shadow  
Across the dim wall more,  
Neither behind them wist they  
From the corner curtain-screened  
King Mark out of the darkness  
Creep with face of fiend!  
  
'Tristram! - ah no -!' A gleam like silver swung  
Downward and struck. And frozen on her tongue  
The low cry died that warned him of his fate,  
Ah God, too late, too late!  
Too late she saw the shadowed image fall  
Of a man's huge armed hand upon the wall,  
And felt the presence clutch her heart, of one  
Like doom behind them, silent, knowing all.  
Dear Christ! too late she heard  
That sudden gasp of sharply loosened breath  
As sheer the great blade fell.  
And Mark stood forth with face of flaming hell,  
And they two looked on death  
And spake no word.
