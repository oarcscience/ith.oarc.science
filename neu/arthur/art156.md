An Arthurian Miscellany at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VIVIEN

### by

## ALAN SEEGER

  
  
Her eyes under their lashes were blue pools  
Fringed round with lilies; her bright hair unfurled  
Clothed her as sunshine clothes the summer world.  
Her robes were gauzes--gold and green and gules,  
All furry things flocked round her, from her hand  
Nibbling their foods and fawning at her feet.  
Two peacocks watched her where she made her seat  
Beside a fountain in Broceliande.  
Sometimes she sang. . . . Whoever heard forgot  
Errand and aim, and knights at noontide here,  
Riding from fabulous gestes beyond the seas,  
Would follow, tranced, and seek . . . and find her not . . .  
But wake that night, lost, by some woodland mere,  
Powdered with stars and rimmed with silent trees.
