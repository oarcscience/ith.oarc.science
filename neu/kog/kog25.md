# THE WITCH AND THE HORSESHOES

ONCE there was a farmer's wife--I can't tell you which one--who was a
witch. Now these folks used to have a feast every Eve of St. Philip and
St. James. As soon as they began to burn the brooms she couldn't rest:
go she must. So she stripped her clothes off, and, standing under the
chimney, she anointed herself with some ointment. When she had finished,
she said: "Fly, but don't touch anything." And away she flew in the
twinkling of an eye. Yes, that was just how it was.

But the farmhand was watching all this from the stables, and he watched
carefully where she put the ointment. So he went in too, stripped his
clothes off, and anointed himself. He said: "Fly, but don't touch
anything." And off he flew till he came to the place where the witches
were having their feast. Now, when he came there, the farmer's wife knew
him, and, to hide herself from him, she turned

herself into a white horse. But he did not lose sight of the horse. He
mounted it and went to the smith with it, and told him to shoe it. Next
day the woman had four horseshoes on, two on her hands and two on her
feet. And she had to stay like that always!
