# VÍŤAZKO

ONCE there was a mother, and, being a mother, she had a son. She suckled
him for twice seven years. After that she took him into a forest and
told him to pull up a fir-tree, roots and all. But the lad could not
pull up the fir-tree.

"You are not strong enough yet," said the mother. So she suckled him for
another seven years. When she had suckled him for thrice seven years,
she took him to the forest again and told him to pull up a beech-tree,
roots and all. He seized hold of the beech and pulled it up.

"Now you are strong enough. So you are Victor (Víťazko). Now you can
provide for me."

"Yes, I will. Only tell me what I can do for you."

"You must get me a good house first, and then you can take me there,"
said the mother, and she went home.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

Víťazko took the beech-tree which he had pulled up, and, carrying it in
his hand like a club, he started in search of a house for his mother.
Following the wind, he walked by old roads and paths until he came to a
castle. This castle was inhabited by griffins.

When Víťazko reached the castle, the griffins would not let him in. But
he did not wait long for their permission: he smashed the gate and went
into the castle and killed the griffins; their bodies he flung over the
wall, and then he went for a walk through the castle. He was pleased
with everything he saw. The rooms were nice, nine in number, but the
tenth was closed. When he had gone through the nine he went into the
tenth, and there he saw a griffin chained to the wall by three iron
bands.

"What are you doing here?" asked Víťazko.

"I am sitting here, as you see. My brothers have chained me here. Untie
my bonds and I will give you a splendid reward."

"You must be a wicked old rascal if your own brothers tied you there. I
won't unfasten your bonds either," said Víťazko.

So he slammed the door, and went off to

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

fetch his mother to the castle. When he had brought her there, he showed
her every-thing, but he did not open the tenth room, and he forbade her
to enter that room, for otherwise there would be trouble. As soon as
Víťazko left the house, the mother could not rest, and she kept on
walking near the door of that tenth room, till at last she went in, and,
of course, she found the griffin there.

"What are you doing here, and who are you?"

"I am a griffin. My own brothers chained me here. They would have
unfastened my bonds again, but your son has killed them all. Untie my
bonds and I will reward you, and, if you like, I will marry you," said
the griffin.

"And what would Víťazko say?" answered the mother.

"What could he say? We will put him out of the world, and you will be
your own mistress."

The mother hesitated long enough, but at last she consented, and then
she asked the griffin how she could untie his bonds.

"Go into the cellar and fetch me a cup of wine from the last cask."

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

The mother went into the cellar and brought him a glass of wine from the
last cask. As soon as he had drained the first cup, crash! the first
chain fell down. The mother brought him another cup and--well! the
second chain snapped. So he begged her to bring him a third cup, and
when she brought him the third cup the third chain broke too and the
griffin was free again.

"But what am I to tell my son when he comes back?" said the mother
anxiously.

"Oh! you must feign illness, and when he asks you what will save you,
say that nothing can save you but a suckling of the earth sow. When he
goes to get it, the sow will tear him in pieces."

Well (but not particularly well!), when Víťazko returned from the chase,
bringing a buck for his mother, she groaned and complained: "Alas! my
dear son, your toil has been in vain. It is no use your bringing me this
good food; I cannot eat it, for I am deadly sick."

"Alas! mother, you must not die. Only tell me what would cure you, and I
will bring it for you, even though it were from hell," cried the good
Víťazko, for he loved his mother well.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

"I can only be cured if I get the suckling of the earth sow."

Víťazko did not wait; he took his beech-tree and set off in quest of the
earth sow. He wandered through the country, poor soul! for he did not
know where to go, till at last he came to a tower, and there he found
Holy Sunday.

"Where are you going?" asked Holy Sunday.

"I am going to the earth sow to get one of her sucklings. My mother is
ill, but this will cure her."

"My dear boy, it will be a hard task for you to get that piglet.
However, I will help you. Only you must follow my advice exactly."

Víťazko promised that he would follow it exactly. So first she gave him
a long, sharp spit, and then she said:

"Go to the stable and take my horse. He will bring you to the place
where the earth sow lies buried in the earth. When you have come there
you must prick one of her pigs. The pig will squeak, and the sow,
hearing it, will start up and run round the earth in a moment. But she
won't see you

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

or anybody else, and so she will tell the pigs that if they squeak again
she will tear them to pieces. Then she will lie down to sleep, and then
you must spit the pig and run quickly away. The pig will be afraid to
squeak, the sow won't stir, and my horse will carry you away."

Víťazko promised to carry out her directions exactly. He took the spit,
mounted the magic horse, and it brought him swiftly to the place--far,
very far it was--where the earth sow lay buried in the earth. Víťazko
pricked one of the pigs, and it squeaked terribly. The sow started
wildly up and ran round the earth in one moment. But the magic horse did
not move, so the sow did not see him or anybody else, and she said
angrily to the pigs:

"If one of you squeaks, I will tear you all to pieces at once."

Having said this, she buried herself again.

At once Víťazko spitted the pig. It kept quiet and didn't squeak at all,
and the magic horse began to fly, and it wasn't long till they were home
again.

"Well, Víťazko, how did it go?" asked Holy Sunday.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

"Well, it went just as you said, and here is the pig."

"Very well. Take it to your mother."

Víťazko gave her back the spit; he led the magic horse back to its
stall, thanked Holy Sunday, and, hanging the pig from the beech-tree,
made haste to go home to his mother.

The mother and the griffin were feasting; they did not expect Víťazko,
and here he was. They ran away and discussed what they should do with
him.

"When he has given you the pig, you must still pretend to be ill," said
the griffin; "and when he asks you what will save you, tell him that
only the Water of Life and the Water of Death can cure you. If he goes
in quest of that, he is bound to perish."

Víťazko came running to the castle full of joy. He gave the pig to his
mother, but she still went on groaning and complaining that she was
going to die, and that the pig would not cure her.

"Alas! mother, don't die, but tell me what will cure you, so that I may
bring it for you at once," said Víťazko anxiously.

"Ah! my dear son, I can only be cured

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

by the Water of Life and the Water of Death, and where would you get
that?" sighed the mother.

Víťazko did not waste time thinking about it. He grasped his beech, and
off he went to Holy Sunday.

"Where are you going, Víťazko?" asked Holy Sunday.

"I am coming to you to ask where I could find the Water of Life and the
Water of Death, for my mother is still ill, and only those will cure
her."

"I t will be a hard task for you to get them, but I will help you as
well as I can. Here are two jugs; mount my magic horse, and he will
bring you to two banks. Beneath those two banks spring forth the Water
of Life and the Water of Death. The right bank opens at noon, and from
beneath it gushes the Water of Life. The left bank opens at midnight,
and beneath it is the Water of Death. As soon as the bank opens, run up
to it and fill your jug with water, and so you must do in the other case
too. When you have the water, come back. Follow my instructions
carefully."

Saying this, she gave him two jugs. He

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

took them and mounted the magic horse, and in a moment they were gone
like the wind. The two banks were in a far distant land, and thither the
magic horse brought Víťazko. At noon he raised the right bank and the
Water of Life gushed forth, then, crash! the bank fell down again, and
it was a wonder that it did not take Víťazko's heels off. Quickly
Víťazko mounted the magic horse and made haste for the left bank. There
they waited till midnight. When the bank lifted, beneath it was the
Water of Death. He hurried to it and filled the jug, and, crash! down
fell the bank again; and it was a marvel it didn't take Víťazko's hand
off. Quickly he mounted the magic horse, the horse flew off, and soon
they were home again.

"Well, Víťazko, how have you fared?" asked Holy Sunday.

"Oh! everything went all right, Holy Sunday; and here is the water,"
said Víťazko, giving her the water.

Holy Sunday kept the water, and gave him two jugs full of spring water
and told him to take them to his mother. Víťazko thanked her and went
home.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

The mother and the griffin were carousing as before, for they did not
expect that he would ever return--and there he was just outside. They
were terribly frightened, and considered how they could get rid of him.

"You must pretend to be sick still, and tell him you won't recover
unless you get the Pelican bird, and he will perish on the quest," said
the griffin.

Víťazko brought the water joyfully, but the mother was still groaning
and complaining; even that was no good, she was sure she was going to
die.

"Ah! don't die, sweet mother. Tell me what will cure you, and I shall be
glad to get it all for you," said the good lad.

"There is no help for me unless I can see the Pelican bird. Where could
you get it for me?" groaned the mother.

Víťazko took his beech again, and it was no trouble to him to go to Holy
Sunday once more.

"Where are you going?" asked Holy Sunday.

"Well, I am coming to you to ask for advice. Mother is still sick; the
water did not cure her either, and she says she must

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

see the Pelican bird. And where is the Pelican bird?"

"My dear child, it would be very hard for you to get the Pelican bird.
But I will help you all I can. The Pelican bird is a gigantic bird, His
neck is very long, and, whenever he shakes his wings, he raises such a
wind that the trees begin to shake. Here is a gun; mount my magic horse,
and he will bring you to the place where the Pelican bird lives. But be
careful. Point the gun against the wind from whatever quarter it blows,
and when the hammer falls, ram the gun with the ramrod and come quickly
back. You must not look into the gun."

Víťazko took the gun and mounted the magic horse, and the horse spread
his wings, and they were flying through the air a long way until they
came to a vast desert, where dwelt the Pelican bird. There the magic
horse stopped. Now Víťazko perceived that the wind was blowing strongly
on his left cheek, so he pointed the gun in that direction, and, clap!
the hammer fell. Víťazko rammed the gun quickly with the ramrod and
flung it over his shoulder, and the horse started flying, and very soon
they were home again.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

"Well, how did things go?"

"I don't know whether they went well or ill, but I did what you
commanded," answered Víťazko, handing down the gun to Holy Sunday.

"All right. You did quite right. Here he is!" she said. And then she
took out the Pelican bird. Then she gave Víťazko another gun to shoot an
eagle with. He went out into the forest, and returned before long with
an eagle. She gave him this eagle for his mother, in place of the
Pelican bird.

The griffin and the mother were making merry again, hoping that Víťazko
would never come back, but he was already near. They were terrified, and
began to consider what new task they were to set him.

"You must pretend to be sick still, and tell him nothing can do you any
good but the golden apples from the garden of the Griffin. If he goes
there the Griffin will tear him in pieces, for he is enraged because
Víťazko has killed his brothers."

Joyfully Víťazko gave the bird to his mother, but she still kept on
groaning; nothing was any good, only the golden

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

apples from the garden of the Griffin could save her.

"You shall have them," said Víťazko, and without resting, he started
again and came to Holy Sunday.

"Where are you going, Víťazko?"

"Well," he replied, "not even that did her any good. Mother is still
sick, for only the golden apples from the garden of the Griffin will
cure her."

"Well, you'll have to fight, my boy," said Holy Sunday; "but, even
though you were stronger than you are, it would be a bad look-out for
you. Still, I will help you all I can. Here is a ring for you; put it on
your finger, and, when you are in need, think of me, turn the ring round
on your finger, and you will have the strength of a hundred men. Now
mount the magic horse; he will take you there."

Víťazko thanked her heartily, mounted the magic horse, and was carried
by him a far journey, till they came to a garden hedged about by a high
rampart. Had it not been for the magic horse Víťazko could never have
got into the garden, but the horse flew like a bird over the rampart.
Víťazko leapt down

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

from the horse, and instantly began to look for a tree with golden
apples. A beautiful girl met him and asked him what he was looking for.
Víťazko said that he was looking for golden apples to cure his sick
mother, and begged her to tell him where to look for them.

"The apple-tree is under my charge, and I must not give the apples to
anybody, or the Griffin would tear me to pieces. I am a king's daughter,
and the Griffin carried me off and brought me to this garden and put me
in charge of the apples. Go back, good youth, go back, for the Griffin
is very strong, and, if he sees you, he will kill you like a fly," said
the girl.

But Víťazko was not to be turned back, and he hastened on into the
garden. So the princess pulled off a priceless ring and handed it to
Víťazko, saying: "Take this ring, and when you think of me and turn this
ring round on your finger, you will have the strength of a hundred men,
otherwise you could not gain the victory over the Griffin."

Víťazko took the ring and put it on his finger. He thanked her and went
off to the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

centre of the garden. In the middle of the garden stood an apple-tree
full of golden apples, and underneath it a horrible Griffin was lying.

"What do you want here, murderer of my brothers?" shouted the Griffin.

"I have come to get some apples from this tree," answered Víťazko
undauntedly.

"You shall not have any of the apples unless you wrestle with me,"
exclaimed the Griffin angrily.

"I will if you like. Come on!" said Víťazko, and he turned the ring on
his right hand and thought of Holy Sunday. He set his legs wide apart
and they began to wrestle. In the first round the Griffin moved Víťazko
a little, but Víťazko drove him into the ground above his ankles. Just
at this moment they heard a swirl of wings above them, and a black raven
shouted to them:

"Which am I to help, the Griffin or Víťazko?"

"Help me," said the Griffin.

"And what will you give me?"

"I will give you gold and silver as much as you like."

"Help me," cried Víťazko, "and I will

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

give you all those horses grazing on yonder meadow."

"I will help you, then," said the raven. "But how am I to help you?"

"Cool me when I grow hot," said Víťazko. He felt hot indeed, for the
Griffin was breathing out fire against him. So they went on wrestling.
The Griffin seized Víťazko and drove him into the ground up to his
ankles. Víťazko turned the ring, and again he thought of Holy Sunday. He
put his arms round the Griffin's waist and drove him down into the
ground above his knees. The black raven dipped his wings in a spring,
and then he alighted on Víťazko's head and sprinkled cool drops over
Víťazko's hot cheeks, and thus he cooled him. Then Víťazko turned the
other ring and thought of the beautiful maiden, and they began wrestling
again. So the Griffin drove Víťazko into the ground up to his ankles,
but Víťazko took hold of him and drove him into the ground up to his
shoulders, and quickly he seized his sword, the gift of Holy Sunday, and
cut the Griffin's head off.

The princess came to him at once and plucked the golden apples for him.
She thanked him too for delivering her, and said

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

that she liked him well and she would marry him.

"I like you well too," confessed Víťazko, "and, if I could, I would go
with you at once. But if you really love me, and if you will consent to
wait a year for me, I will come to you then."

The princess pledged herself by shaking hands with him, and she said she
would wait a year for him. And so they said good-bye to each other.
Víťazko mounted his horse, cleared the rampart at a leap, killed the
horses on the meadow for the black raven, and hastened home.

"Well, how have you fared?" asked Holy Sunday.

"Very well, but if it hadn't been for a ring which was given me by a
princess I should have fared very badly," answered Víťazko, and he told
her everything. She told him to go home with the golden apples and to
take the magic horse with him too. Víťazko obeyed.

The griffin and the mother were carousing again. They were greatly
startled when Víťazko came riding home; they had never expected that he
would return alive even from

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

the garden of the Griffin. The mother asked what she should do; but the
griffin had no more shifts; he made off to the tenth room at once and
hid himself there. When Víťazko had given the apples to his mother, she
pretended that the mere sight of them had cured her, and, rising from
the bed, she put the finest of food before Víťazko and then began to
caress him as she used to do sometimes when he was a tiny baby. Víťazko
was delighted to see his mother in good health again. The mother took a
strong cotton cord and said jestingly: "Lie down, dear son; I will wind
this cord round you as I used to wind it round your father, to see if
you are as strong as he was, and if you can break it."

Víťazko smiled and laid himself down, and allowed his mother to wind the
cord round him. When she had finished, he stretched his limbs and snapt
the cord in pieces.

"You are strong," she said. "But wait! I will wind this thin silk cord
round you to see if you can break it also."

So she did. Víťazko tried to stretch his limbs, but the more he
stretched, the deeper

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

the cord cut into him. So he was helpless, and had to lie like a baby in
its swaddling-clothes. Now the griffin hastened to cut his head off; he
hewed the body in pieces and hung the heart from the ceiling. The mother
packed the body in a cloth, and put the bundle on the back of the magic
horse, which was waiting in the courtyard, saying:

"You carried him alive, so you can carry him dead too, wherever you
like."

The horse did not wait, but flew off, and soon they reached home.

Holy Sunday had been expecting him, for she knew what would probably
happen to him. Without delay she rubbed the body with the Water of
Death, then she put it together and poured the Water of Life over it.
Víťazko yawned, and rose to his feet alive and well. "Well, I have had a
long sleep," he said to himself.

"You would have been sleeping till doomsday if I hadn't awakened you.
Well, how do you feel now?"

"Oh! I am all right! Only, it's funny: it's as though I had not got any
heart."

"That is true; you haven't got a heart," answered Holy Sunday.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

"Where can it be, then?"

"Where else should it be, but in the castle, hanging from the
crossbeam?" said Holy Sunday, and she told him all that had happened to
him.

But Víťazko could not be angry, neither could he weep, for he had no
heart. So he had to go and get it. Holy Sunday gave him a fiddle and
sent him to the castle. He was to play on the fiddle, and, as a reward,
was to ask for the heart, and, when he got it, he must return at once to
Holy Sunday--those were her orders.

Víťazko went to the castle, and when he saw that his mother was looking
out of the window, he began playing beautifully. The mother was
delighted with the music below, so she called the old fiddler (for Holy
Sunday had put that shape upon him) into the castle and asked him to
play. He played, and the mother danced with the griffin; they danced
hard, and did not stop until they were tired. Then the mother gave the
fiddler meat and drink, and she offered him gold, but he would not take
it.

"What could I do with all that money? I am too old for it," he answered.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

"Well, what am I to give you, then? It is for you to ask," said the
mother.

"What are you to give me?" said he, looking round the room. "Oh! give me
that heart, hanging there from the crossbeam!"

"If you like that, we can give it to you," said the griffin, and the
mother took it down and gave it to Víťazko. He thanked them for it, and
hastened from the castle to Holy Sunday.

"It is lucky that we have got it again," said Holy Sunday; and she took
the heart in her hands, washed it first in the Water of Death and
afterwards in the Water of Life, and then she put it in the bill of the
Pelican bird. The bird stretched out his long neck and replaced the
heart in Víťazko's breast. At once Víťazko felt it joyfully leaping. And
for this service Holy Sunday gave the Pelican bird his freedom again.

And now she said to Víťazko: "You must go once more to the castle and
deal out justice. Take the form of a pigeon and, when you think of me,
you will regain your own shape."

No sooner had she said this than Víťazko was changed into a pigeon, and
away he

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

flew to the castle. The mother and the griffin were caressing each other
when suddenly a pigeon alighted on the windowsill. As soon as the mother
saw the pigeon she sent the griffin to shoot him, but before the griffin
could get hold of his crossbow the pigeon flew down into the hall, took
human form, seized the sword and cut the griffin's head off at a stroke.

"And what am I to do with thee, thou good-for-nothing mother?" he said,
turning to his mother, who in terror fell at his feet begging for mercy.
"Do not be afraid--I will not do you any harm. Let God judge between
us." He took her hand and led her to the castle yard, unsheathed his
sword, and said: "Behold, mother! I will throw this sword into the air.
If I am guilty, it will strike me; if you are guilty, it is you it will
strike. Let God decide."

The sword whirled through the air, it darted past Víťazko's head, and
smote straight into his mother's heart.

Víťazko lamented over her and buried her. Then he returned to Holy
Sunday and thanked her well for all her kindness. He girded on the
sword, took his beech-tree

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

in his hand, and went to his beautiful princess. He found her with her
royal father, who had tried to make her marry various kings and princes,
but she would marry none of them. She would wait a year, she said. The
year was not yet over when one day Víťazko arrived in the royal palace
to ask for the maiden's hand.

"This is my betrothed," exclaimed the princess joyfully, as soon as she
saw him, and she went straight up to him.

A splendid feast was made ready, the father gave his kingdom into their
hands, and that is the end of this story.
