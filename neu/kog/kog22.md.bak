# THE KNIGHT BAMBUS

THERE was a poor gamekeeper once, who had suffered from hard times all
his life, so as he grew older, he wanted to get rich. He was only an
under-forester. One day the forester said: "Near those old ruins, you
know the ones I mean, a fox or a roe, or some creature of that sort,
often crosses my path, and I can never manage to hit it, though I have
shot at it a hundred times. If you happen to be going in that direction,
look out for it."

When the gamekeeper heard this, the first thing he did was to go to the
ruins. Just as he got there, a huge fox appeared with a rustling noise.
The gamekeeper felt uneasy, but the fox disappeared at once, so he sat
down, put five big charges in his gun, and waited. It wasn't long till
the fox appeared again, and this time he was carrying a young fawn in
his mouth. The gamekeeper shot at him--boom! The fox cried out, and ran

off into the bushes. But the gamekeeper saw that the fawn had run away
and hidden itself in a cave. He thought: "The fox cried out, so he has
some of my shots in his fur coat. I'll get him some other time."

So he went into the ruins through the gate. Within, there was a
courtyard all deserted, and with its wall fallen down. So the
game-keeper passed through the courtyard and came into a spacious
cellar. There he saw three lamps burning, and looking round, he was
filled with amazement. But all this was as nothing, for in the corner
were three glittering heaps of golden coins and one heap of big gold
pieces. The gamekeeper reflected: "If I had all that, I should give up
gamekeeping and have a splendid time."

No sooner had he said this than a grey old man appeared and asked: "What
are you looking for, gamekeeper?"

"Well, I shot at a fox and he ran in some-where here, and so I'm
wandering about looking for him."

"You won't get the fox you're looking for, for I am he."

"And why are you here in a fox's shape? What's the reason of that?"

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

"I am the Knight Bambus, and all these forests belong to this castle. I
was a robber-knight, and so as a punishment I have to keep watch here
now."

"And how long is it to last?"

"When three poor people come here, and each of them takes away two
sackfuls of gold, I shall be delivered. I am bound to give all this gold
away for nothing. Already I have outlived three generations of my
kinsmen here."

Then he bade him fetch two leather sacks from the other room and collect
the gold into them, filling them up to the brim. He must keep it all for
himself and must not tell any one what he had seen. The gamekeeper
promised that he wouldn't even tell his wife, Hátička, how he had got
the money. So he filled the two sacks up to the brim, and the old man
helped him to hoist them on to his shoulders and saw him out of the
door. All the time he kept warning him to keep his mouth shut: "For what
a woman knows all the world knows; that's gospel truth, sure enough."

So the gamekeeper left the castle, carrying those two sacks, and the man
shook hands with him before he left. At the border of the

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

forest, near a beech-tree, his wife, Háta, was standing looking for him.
She ran up to him.

"Great Heavens, Florian! where have you been all this long time? I have
been looking everywhere for you for three days."

Now Florian was delighted that his wife had come to meet him, so he
blurted out: "Hátička, wife, Count Bambus has given me these two sacks
of gold pieces. Have a look here--see what heaps of the stuff there
are!" and he let one of the sacks fall on the ground. But behold!
instead of gold there were only rustling leaves in it. Then he
remembered that he was not to say anything about it. He frowned, and his
wife burst into tears; and they had to spend the rest of their life,
until they died, in poverty just as before.
