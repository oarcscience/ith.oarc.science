# THE HAUNTED MILL

THERE was a haunted mill, and, dear me, what was it like! A rope-dancer
came there with some monkeys. In the evening the Waternick came with a
basketful of fishes. He made a fire and fried the fishes. Meanwhile the
monkeys had been sitting behind the stove, but when the Nick put the
fishes in the pan and was tasting whether they were done, the monkeys
came from behind the stove, and one of them put its paw into the pan.
The man smacked him over the paw and said: "Get away, pussy! You didn't
catch them, so don't eat them." And the monkey ran away.

After awhile comes another monkey and puts his paw in the pan. He
smacked him too and said the same. But the rope-dancer had a bear, too,
which was lying under the table all the time; and, when he heard the
Waternick speak, he came from under the table, ran straight to the pan,
and put his

paw into it. The Waternick did the same to him as he had done to the
monkeys. But the bear couldn't stand that. He sprang upon the poor
Waternick and gave him a good beating. The Waternick had to run off,
leaving the fishes behind. He didn't haunt the mill any more, and that's
how they got rid of him.
