### NOTE

The stories in this book are those that Russian peasants tell their
children and each other. In Russia hardly anybody is too old for fairy
stories, and I have even heard soldiers on their way to the war talking
of very wise and very beautiful princesses as they drank their tea by
the side of the road. I think there must be more fairy stories told in
Russia than anywhere else in the world. In this book are a few of those
I like best. I have taken my own way with them more or less, writing
them mostly from memory. They, or versions like them, are to be found in
the coloured chap-books, in Afanasiev's great collection, or in solemn,
serious volumes of folklorists writing for the learned. My book is not
for the learned, or indeed for grown-up people at all. No people who
really like fairy stories ever grow up altogether. This is a book
written far away in Russia, for English children who play in deep lanes
with wild roses above them in the high hedges, or by the

small singing becks that dance down the gray fells at home. Russian
fairyland is quite different. Under my windows the wavelets of the
Volkhov (which has its part in one of the stories) are beating quietly
in the dusk. A gold light burns on a timber raft floating down the
river. Beyond the river in the blue midsummer twilight are the broad
Russian plain and the distant forest. Somewhere in that forest of great
trees--a forest so big that the forests of England are little woods
beside it--is the hut where old Peter sits at night and tells these
stories to his grandchildren.
