### SPRING IN THE FOREST.

Warmer the sun shone, and warmer yet. The pines were green now. All the
snow had melted off them, drip, drip, the falling drops of water making
tiny wells in the snow under the trees. And the snow under the trees was
melting too. Much had gone, and now there were only patches of snow in
the forest--like scraps of a big white blanket, shrinking every day.

"Isn't it lucky our blankets don't shrink like that?" said Maroosia.

Old Peter laughed.

"What do you do when the warm weather comes?" he asked. "Do you still
wear sheepskin coats? Do you still roll up at night under the rugs?"

"No," said Maroosia; "I throw the rugs off, and put my fluffy coat away
till next winter."

"Well," said old Peter, "and God, the Father of us all, He does for the
earth just what you do for yourself; but He does it better. For the
blankets He gives the earth in winter get smaller and smaller as

the warm weather comes, little by little, day by day."

"And then a hard frost comes, grandfather," said Ivan.

"God knows all about that, little one," said old Peter, "and it's for
the best. It's good to have a nip or two in the spring, to make you feel
alive. Perhaps it's His way of telling the earth to wake up. For the
whole earth is only His little one after all."

That night, when it was story-time, Ivan and Maroosia consulted
together; and when old Peter asked what the story was to be, they were
ready with an answer.

"The snow is all melting away," said Ivan.

"The summer is coming," said Maroosia.

"We'd like the tale of the little snow girl," said Ivan.

"'The Little Daughter of the Snow,'" said Maroosia.

Old Peter shook out his pipe, and closed his eyes under his bushy
eyebrows, thinking for a minute. Then he began.
