### INTRODUCTION

### Distribution of Gypsies.

No race is more widely scattered over the earth's surface than the
Gypsies; the very Jews are less ubiquitous. Go where one will in Europe,
one comes upon Gypsies everywhere--from Finland to Sicily, from the
shores of the Bosporus to the Atlantic seaboard. Something under a
million is their probable number in Europe; of these Hungary claims
275,000, Roumania 200,000, Servia 38,000, and Bulgaria 52,000. How many
Gypsies there are in Great Britain I have not the vaguest notion, for
there are no statistics of the slightest value to go by. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) But I have never lived for any length of
time in any place--and I have stayed in most parts of both England and
Scotland--without lighting sooner or later on nomadic or house-dwelling
Gypsies. London and all round London, the whole Thames valley as high at
least as Oxford, the Black Country, Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, and
Yarmouth, it is here I should chiefly look for settled Gypsies. Whilst
from study of parish registers, local histories, and suchlike, and from
my own knowledge, I doubt if there is the parish between Land's End and
John o’ Groats where Gypsies have not pitched their camp some time or
other in the course of the last four centuries.

Asia has untold thousands of these wanderers, in Anatolia, Syria,
Armenia, Persia, Turkestan, and Siberia, perhaps also India and China;
so, too, has Africa, in Egypt, Algeria, Darfûr, and Kordofan. We find
them in both the Americas, from Pictou in Canada to Rio in Brazil; nor
are New Zealand and Australia without at least their isolated bands.

To-day at any rate the sedentary Gypsies must greatly outnumber the
nomadic: in Hungary only 9000, or less than one-thirtieth of the entire
number, are returned as 'constantly on the move.' Still the race has
always been largely a migratory race; its wide distribution is due to
bygone migrations. Of these the most important known to us is that of
the first half of the fifteenth century, whose movements have been so
lovingly and laboriously traced by the late

in his *Dè l’Apparition et de la Dispersion des Bohémiens en Europe*
(1844), *Nouvelles Recherches* (1849), and 'Immigration of the Gypsies
into Western Europe in the Fifteenth Century' (*Gypsy Lore Journal*,
April 1889 to January 1890, for pages <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[ix:1](gft003.htm#fr_0) According to the
*Spectator* (24th December 1897) ten thousand Gypsies wintered in Surrey
in 1896-97!

<span id="fn_1"></span>[x:1](gft003.htm#fr_1) I shall have frequent
occasion to refer to the *Gypsy Lore Journal* (3 vols. 1888-92), which
should in time be one of the *libri rarissimi*, as the issue was limited
to 150 copies, many of which are sure to have perished. There are
complete sets, however, at the British Museum, the Bodleian, the
Edinburgh Advocates' Library, Leyden, Berlin, Munich, Cracow, Rome,
Madrid, Harvard, and twelve other public libraries.
