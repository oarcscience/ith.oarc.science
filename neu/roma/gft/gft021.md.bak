### Nails of Crucifixion.

Du Cange's last passage is by far the most interesting:--'Anonymus de
Passione Domini: "And when they arrive at the place, the *komodromos*
coming to crucify him," etc.' 'Why so interesting? there does not seem
much in that,' my readers may exclaim. Why? because there is a
widely-spread superstition that a Gypsy forged the nails for the
crucifixion, and that henceforth his race has been accursed of heaven.
That superstition was first recorded in an article by Dr. B. Bogisic on
'Die slavisirten Zigeuner in Montenegro' (*Das Ausland*, 25th May 1874);
and in *Le Folklore de Lesbos*, by G. Georgeakis and Léon Pineau (Paris,
1891, pp. 273-8), is this 'Chant du Vendredi Saint,' this plaint of Our
Lady:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'Our Lady was in a grotto  
And made her prayer.  
She hears rolling of thunder,  
She sees lightnings,  
She hears a great noise.  
She goes to the window:  
She sees the heaven all black  
And the stars veiled:  
The bright moon was bathed in blood.  
She looks to right, she looks to left:  
She perceives St. John;  
She sees John coming  
In tears and dejection:  
He holds a handkerchief spotted with blood.  
"Good-day, John. Wherefore  
These tears and this dejection?  
Has thy Master beaten thee,  
Or hast thou lost the Psalter?"  
"The Master has not beaten me,  
And I have not lost the Psalter.  
I have no mouth to tell it thee,  
Nor tongue to speak to thee:  
And thine heart will be unable to hear me.  
These miserable Jews have arrested my Master,  
They have arrested him like a thief,  
And they are leading him away like a murderer." <span
id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>  
Our Lady, when she heard it,  
Fell and swooned.  
They sprinkle her from a pitcher of water,  
From three bottles of musk,  
And from four bottles of rose-water,  
Until she comes to herself.  
When she was come to herself, she says,  
"All you who love Christ and adore him,  
Come with me to find him,  
Before they kill him,  
And before they nail him,  
And before they put him to death.  
Let Martha, Magdalene, and Mary come,  
And the mother of the Forerunner."  
These words were still on her lips,  
Lo! five thousand marching in front,  
And four thousand following after.  
They take the road, the path of the Jews.  
No one went near the Jews except the unhappy mother.  
The path led them in front of the door of a nail-maker.  
She finds the nail-maker with his children,  
The nail-maker with his wife.  
"Good-day, workman, what art making there?"  
"The Jews have ordered nails of me;  
They have ordered four of me;  
But I, I am making them five."  
"Tell me, tell me, workman,  
What they will do with them."  
"They will put two nails in his feet,  
Two others in his hands;  
And the other, the sharpest,  
Will pierce his lung."  
Our Lady, when she heard it,  
Fell and swooned.  
They sprinkle her from a pitcher of water  
From three bottles of musk,  
And from four bottles of rose;  
Until she comes to herself.  
When she had come to herself, she says:  
"Be accursed, O Tziganes!  
May there never be a cinder in your forges,  
May there never be bread on your bread-pans,  
Nor buttons to your shirts!"  
They take the road,' etc.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And M. Georgeakis
adds in a footnote, The Tziganes whom one sees in the island of Mitylene
are all smiths.' It is a far cry from the Greek Archipelago to the
Highlands of Scotland, but in the

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Gypsy Lore
Journal* (iii. 1892, p. 190), is this brief unsigned note: 'I should be
pleased to know if you have the tradition in the South \[of Scotland\],
that the tinkers are descendants of the one who made the nails for the
Cross, and are condemned to wander continually without rest.' No answer
appeared; and I know of no other hint of the currency of this belief in
Western Europe, unless it be the couplet:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'A whistling maid and a crowing hen  
Are hateful alike to God and men,'

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'because,'
according to Lieut.--Col. A. Fergusson (*Notes and Queries*, August
1879, p. 93), though he gives no authorities, 'a woman stood by and
whistled while she watched the nails for the Cross being forged.' <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

On the other hand, the Gypsies of Alsace have a legend of their own,
opposed to, and probably devised expressly to refute, the *gaújo* or
Gentile version. How there were two Jew brothers, Schmul and Rom-Schmul.
The first of them exulted at the Crucifixion; the other would gladly
have saved Our Lord from death, and, finding that impossible, did what
he could--pilfered one of the four nails. So it came about that Christ's
feet must be placed one over the other, and fastened with a single nail.
And Schmul remained a Jew, but Rom-Schmul turned Christian, and was the
founder of the Rómani race ('Die Zigeuner in Elsass and in
Deutschlothringen,' by Dr. G. Mühl, in *Der Salon*, 1874). In a letter
of 16th December 1880, M. Bataillard wrote: 'An Alsatian Gypsy woman,
one of the Reinhart family, has been at me for some time past to procure
a remission of sentence for one of her relations who has been in gaol
since ad October. "The *Manousch*" \[Gypsies\], she urges, "are not bad;
they do not murder." And on my answering with a smile that unluckily
they are only too prone to take what doesn't belong to them, and that
the judges, knowing this, are extra severe towards them, her answer is,
"It is true, it's in the blood. Besides, you surely know, you who know
all about the Manousch, they have leave to steal once in seven years."
"How so?" "It's a story you surely must know. They were just going to
crucify Jesus. One of our women passed by, and she whipped up one of the
nails they were going to use. She would have liked to steal all four
nails, but couldn't. Anyhow, it was always one, and that's why Jesus was
crucified with only three nails, a single one for the two feet. And
that's why Jesus

<span id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span>

gave the *Manousch* leave to steal once every seven years."' <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) The Lithuanian Gypsies say, likewise, that
'stealing has been permitted in their favour by the crucified Jesus,
because the Gypsies, being present at the Crucifixion, stole one of the
four nails. Hence when the hands had been nailed, there was but one nail
left for the feet; and therefore God allowed them to steal, and it is
not accounted a sin to them.' ('The Lithuanian Gypsies and their
Language,' by Mieczyslaw Dowojno-Sylwestrowicz, in *Gypsy Lore Journal*,
i. 1889, p. 253.)

This Gypsy counter-legend offers a possible explanation of the
hitherto-unexplained transition from four nails to three in crucifixes
during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The change must at first
have been hardly less startling than a crucifix now would be in which
both hands should be pierced with one nail. Dr. R. Morris discusses it
in his Introduction to *Legends of the Holy Rood* (Early Eng. Text Soc.,
1875). There it appears that while St. Gregory Nazianzen, Nonnus, and
the author of the *Ancren Riwle* speak of three nails only, SS. Cyprian,
Augustine, and Gregory of Tours, Pope Innocent 555., Rufinus, Theodoret,
and Ælfric speak of four; and that the earliest known crucifix with
three nails only is a copper one, of probably Byzantine workmanship,
dating from the end of the twelfth century. Now, if the Byzantine
Gypsies possessed at that date a metallurgical monopoly, this crucifix
must of course have been fashioned by Gypsy hands, when the three nails
would be an easily intelligible protest against the calumny that those
nails were forged by the founder of the Gypsy race.

I give the suggestion just for what it is worth; but the occurrence of
the legend and the counter-legend in regions so far apart as Lesbos and
Scotland, Alsace and Lithuania, strongly argues their antiquity, and
corroborates the idea that the *komodromos* was a Gypsy who figures in
'Anonymus de Passione Domini.' One would like to know the date of that
Greek manuscript; but Professor R. Bensly, in a long letter of 28th May
5879, could only conjecturally identify it with 'S. Joannis Theologi
Commentarius Apocryphus MS. de J. C.' (? No. 929 or 5005, Colbert Coll.
Paris Cat. MSS. <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9).md). Probably there are
many allusions to *komodromoi* in Byzantine writers, if one had leisure
and scholarship to hunt them up; certainly it is strange that of Du
Cange's six quotations for *komodromoi* four should seem unmistakably to
point to Gypsies. I myself have

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

little doubt of their identity. From which it would follow that more
than a thousand years ago south-eastern Europe had its Gypsies, and that
not as new-comers, but as recognised strollers, like the Boswells and
Stanleys of our old grassy lanes. The verb *kōmodromein* occurs in
Pollux Archæologus (*flo*. 583 A.D.); and the classic authors present
many hints of the possible presence of Gypsies in their midst. Rómani
Chals, or Gypsies, would often fit admirably for *Chaldæi*; and the fact
that the water-wagtail is the 'Gypsy bird' of both German and English
Gypsies reminds one that the Greeks had a saying, as old at least as the
fifth century B.C., 'Poorer than a kinklos' (κίγκλος = water-wagtail),
and that peasants in the third century A.D. called homeless wanderers
*kinkloi*. One need not, with Erasmus and Pierius, derive *Cingarus*
(*Zingaro*, *Tchinghiané*, *Zigeuner*, etc.) from *kinklos*; the words
in all likelihood were as distinct originally as *Gypsies* (Egyptians)
and *vipseys* or *gipseys* (eruptions of water in the East Riding of
Yorkshire; *cf*. William of Newburgh's twelfth century Chronicle). But
the Gypsies may have been led, by the resemblance of its name to theirs,
to adopt the water-wagtail as their bird; and Theognis and Menander may
have applied to the water-wagtail the epithets 'much-wandering' and
'poor,' because the bird was associated in their minds with some poor
wandering race.

I do not build on this guesswork, as neither even on the ingenious
theories of M. Bataillard, according to which prehistoric Europe gained
from the Gypsies its knowledge of metallurgy, and which may be studied
in his *L’Ancienneté des Tsiganes* (1877) and other monographs, or in my
summaries of them in the articles 'Gipsies' (*Encycl. Britannica*, vol.
x. 1879, p. 658), and 'Gypsies' (*Chambers's Encycl.*, vol. v. 5890, p.
487). All that I hold for certain is our absolute uncertainty at present
whether Gypsies first set foot in Europe a thousand years after or a
thousand years before the Christian era. We have no certitude even for
western Europe. In 1866 a large band of English ball-giving Gypsies paid
a visit to Edinburgh; Scottish newspapers of that date wrote as though
Gypsies had never till then been seen to the north of the Border. That
was ridiculous: a similar mistake may have been made by the German,
Swiss, Italian, and French chroniclers of 1417-34. As it is, M.
Bataillard has established the presence, before 1400, of 'foreigners
called *Bemische*' in the bishopric of Würzburg, who may have been
Gypsies, as almost indubitably were certain *Bemische* at
Frankfort-on-Main in 1495 (*Gypsy Lore Journal*, i. 207-50). <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then 'A Charter of
Edward III. confirming the Privileges of St. Giles' Fair, Winchester,
A.D. 1349 (ed. by Dean Kitchin, 1886), contains this passage:--'And the
Justiciaries and the Treasurer of the Bishop of Wolvesey for the time
being, and the Clerk of the Pleas, shall yearly receive four basons and
ewers, by way of fee (as they have received them of old time) from those
traders from foreign parts, called *Dynamitters*, who sell brazen
vessels in the fair.' On which passage Dean Kitchin has this note:
'These foreigners were sellers, we are told, of brazen vessels of all
kinds. The word may be connected with *Dinant* near Namur, where there
was a great manufacture of *Dinanderie*, *i.e.* metal-work (chiefly in
copper). A friend suggests *Dinant-batteurs* as the origin. *Batteur*
was the proper title of these workers in metal. See Commines, II. i.,
'une marchandise de ces œuvres de cuivre, qu’on appelle *Dinanderie*,
qui sont en effet *pots et pesles*."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_7"></span>[xxix:1](gft021.htm#fr_7.md) It is just worth noting
that St. Columbanus (543-615) was accustomed to celebrate the Eucharist
in vessels of bronze (*aeris*), alleging as a reason for so doing that
Our Lord was affixed to the cross by brazen nails.--Smith's *Dict.
Christ. Antiqs.*, s.v. CHALICE.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[xxx:1](gft021.htm#fr_8.md) *Cf. supra*, [p.
xi](gft005.htm#page_xi.md)., line 13.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[xxx:2](gft021.htm#fr_9.md) Information supplied by
M. Omont of the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, and by Prof, von
Dobschütz of Jena, shows that the *komodromos* passage is to be found in
neither of these two mss. It has still to be sought for, then.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[xxxi:1](gft021.htm#fr_10.md) In his *Beiträge zur
Kenntniss der deutschen Zigeuner* (Halle, 1894) pp. 5-6), Herr Richard
Pischel maintains, as it seems to me, successfully, that the 'Bemische
<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span> lute' (*Boehmische Leute*) at
Würzburg between 1372 and 1400 were real Bohemians and not Gypsies.
