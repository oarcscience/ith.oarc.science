*Gypsy Folk Tales*, by Francis Hindes Groome, \[1899\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Miklosich.

In part iv. of his great work, *Ueber die Mundarten and die Wanderungen
der Zigeuner Europa's* (Vienna, 1874), Dr. Franz von Miklosich published
fifteen Gypsy folk-tales and nine songs from the Bukowina, in the
original Rómani, with an interlinear Latin translation. They were
collected by Professor Leo Kirilowicz, of Czernowicz, but when, where,
or from whom is not told; and they, alone of Gypsy folk-tales, have been
utilised by M. Emmanuel Cosquin to illustrate his admirable *Contes de
Lorraine* (2 vols. 1886). I have given them all in full, except 'The
Rivals,' part only of which is cited under [No. 48](gft108.htm#an_48.md),
[p. 181](gft108.htm#page_181.md). 'Tropsyn,' 'The Enchanted City,' and 'The
Jealous Husband' are perhaps the best; the last has a special interest
through its relation to Cymbeline. In his Beiträge zur Kenntniss der
Zigeunermundarten (part iv., Vienna 1878), Miklosich published three
more folk-tales, communicated by Professor Kirilowicz, Herr J. Kluch,
and Dr. M. Gaster--the first a Lying Story from the Bukowina ([No.
35](gft095.htm#an_35).md), the second, 'The Three Brothers,' from the
Hungarian Carpathians ([No. 31](gft091.htm#an_31).md), and the third, a
mere fragment, from Roumania. This fragment is on the familiar theme of
an emperor who till old age has had no heir; then his empress bears him
a son; but just as the child is being shown to the people, two eagles
carry it off. 'Men,' cries the empress, 'if you will find my boy, I will
become your servant, to wait on you, to wash your feet, to drink the
water they are washed in, to quit my greatness, to make you king in my
stead, if only you will find my boy.' After which the story becomes
hopeless nonsense, then suddenly stops--I fancy the Gypsy story-teller
had got too drunk to continue.
