### No. 65.--The Three Wishes <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](gft124.htm#fn_135)

A fool lives with his mother. Once on a hillside he finds a young lady
exposed to the heat of the sun, and twines a bower of bushes round her
for protection. She awakes, and gives him three wishes. He wishes he
were at home: no sooner said than done. On the way he catches a glimpse
of a lovely lady at a window, and wishes idly that she were with child
by him. She proves so, but knows not the cause. She bears a child, and
her parents summon every one from far and near to visit her. When the
fool enters, the babe says, 'Dad, dad!' Disgusted at the lover's low
estate, the parents cast all three adrift in a boat. The lady asks him
how she became with child, and he tells her. 'Then you must have a wish
still left.' He wishes they were safe on shore in a fine castle of their
own. They live happily there for some time, then return home, and visit
the girl's parents splendidly dressed. The parents refuse to believe him
the same man. He returns in his old clothes. Triumph and reconciliation.
He provides for his old mother.

<span class="small">This story is largely identical with Hahn's No. 8,
'Der Halbe Mensch' (i. 102; 201), which lacks, however, the episode of
making a bower</span>

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="small">for the fairy. That episode forms the opening of
Wratislaw's Illyrian-Slovenish story of 'The Vila' (No. 60, p. 314),
otherwise different. And the whole Welsh-Gypsy story is absolutely
identical with Basile's story of Peruonto in the Pentamerone (i. 3). For
the recognition of the father by the child see Clouston, ii. 159, note.
In Hahn's story the child gives its father an apple; and in Friedrich
Müller's Hungarian-Gypsy story, No. 3, 'The Wallachian Gypsy,' a lady is
adjudged to him to whom she shall throw a red apple. *Cf*. also Hahn, i.
94, ii. 56; Bernhard Schmidt's *Griechische Märchen*, pp. 85, 228; and
Reinhold Köhler in *Orient and Occident*, ii. 1864, pp. 304, 306.</span>
