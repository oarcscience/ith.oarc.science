### Dr. Paspati.

Alexander G. Paspati, M.D., who died at Athens in the Christmas week of
1891, practised long as a doctor at Constantinople, and was an eminent
Byzantine antiquary. His *Études sur les Tchinghianés ou Bohémiens de
l’Empire Ottoman* (Cont. 1870, 652 pp.), is one of the very best works
that we have on the Rómani language. It is largely based on
Turkish-Gypsy folk-tales, of which Dr. Paspati seems to have made a huge
collection, but six only of which are published by him as an appendix
(pp. 594-629), in the original Rómani with a French translation. Two of
these six stories--'Baldpate,' [No. 2](gft062.htm#an_02.md), and The
Riddle,' [No. 3](gft063.htm#an_03.md)--he got from a sedentary Gypsy, 'Léon
Zafíri, middle-aged, by profession mower, musician, and story-teller.
Gifted with a prodigious memory, this man has repeated to me a great
number of folk-tales (*contes fabuleux*), portions of which I have
inserted in the text of my vocabulary. To test his memory I have made
him repeat some of these stories, and he has retold them word for word,
making only very slight changes. During the long nights of winter his
brother Gypsies invite him to tell his tales, which he also translates
into Turkish with extreme facility. I have one whose recital would
occupy two hours. These stories are very old. He has heard them from
various members of his race, and has been able to retain them in his
marvellous memory. I have written these stories at his dictation. I have
several volumes of them among my papers. Several were told by his
grandfather, long since dead, who was also a story-teller. In these
stories, with their mixture of truth and fable, I have not hitherto met
any token either of their Indian origin or of an ancient faith. I say
that these stories are old, for one finds in them words such as
*manghín*, *shéhi*, etc., which to-day are quite forgotten by the
Tchinghianés. This illiterate man is not only familiar with the dialect
of the Sedentary Gypsies, but he knows also that of the Nomads, in whose
midst he sings his songs and tells his stories. One is sorry to see a
man of such intelligence, so superior to the mass of his race, dragging
out a pitiful existence and clad in rags' (pp. 34-35).

Paspati was, obviously, no folklorist; the folk-tales to him were
valuable solely as so much linguistic material. But every word almost of
the above deserves the closest consideration. I have tried, but in vain
hitherto, to recover some trace of those 'several volumes'; their
destruction would be a grievous loss to the science of folklore. <span

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Still, from
passages cited in the vocabulary, one can guess at in some cases, and in
others actually identify, a portion of their contents. Thus, when one
finds, 'The Sun said to her, "Thou art pretty, and thou art good; thou
art not as pretty as Maklítcha"' (p. 580), one may feel sure that the
Tchinghianés must possess some such version of Grimm's 'Little
Snow-white' (No. 53) as 'Marietta et la Sorcière, sa Marâtre,' in Carnoy
and Nicolaides' *Traditions Populaires de l’Asie Mineure* (p. 91), where
the stepmother asks, not a mirror, but the Sun, 'Hast thou seen any
woman fairer than I?' and the Sun answers, 'I am fair, thou art fair,
but not so fair as Marietta.' Three passages point as clearly to
Bernhard Schmidt's 'Die Schönste' (*Griechische Märchen*, p. 88), or
some other version of 'Beauty and the Beast':--'In those days there was
a man with three daughters. He said, "I am going to the city, I ask you
what your souls desire me to bring you"' (p. 394); 'The eldest daughter
said, "O father, bring me a thousand pieces of linen, to make dresses
of"' (p. 410); and 'The middle daughter came, and she said, "Bring me, O
father, the heaven with the stars, the sea with the fishes, the forest
with the flowers"' (p. 535). 'My daughter, if your husband goes home,
and one of his people kisses him, he will forget you, and you will
remain in the forest' (p. 555) must be an excerpt from a 'Forsaken
Bride' tale; and in 'He became a church, and the girl turned into a
priest' (p. 580) one recognises a widespread episode, which recurs in
our [No. 34](gft094.htm#an_34.md), 'Made over to the Devil,' and [No.
50](gft110.htm#an_50.md), 'The Witch.' Similarly, our , 'The Deluded
Dragon,' a Bukowina-Gypsy version of 'The Valiant Little Tailor,' is
foreshadowed by--'I am looking for the biggest mountain, to seize you,
and fling you there, that not a bone of you may remain whole,' on which
Paspati observes that 'this story relates the combat of a young man with
a dragon, and the speaker here is the young man' (p. 576). 'She stuck a
pin in her head; as soon as she had done so, the young girl turned into
a pretty and beautiful bird' (p. 514), may be matched from India
(*infra*, [p. 271](gft132.htm#page_271).md); and 'He gave the old man a
feather, and said to the old man, "Take it and carry it to the maiden. I
will come when she burns it,"' is discussed on our [p.
167](gft106.htm#page_167). The 'Beauty of the World' (pp. 347, 511, 569.md)
is familiar through Hahn; and with Hahn i. p. 90, compare 'The mare was
pregnant, and his wife, the queen, also was pregnant' (p. 195). 'The
king said, "Come, my brother, and restore her to human shape" (a story
of a woman punished by being turned into an ass),' on p. 351, must
belong to a variant of our [No. 25](gft085.htm#an_25.md), 'The Hen that
laid Diamonds'; and our [No. 7](gft067.htm#an_07.md), 'The Snake who became
the King's Son-in-law,' is suggested by two passages on pp. 262, 266:

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'He said to his
mother, "I want the king's daughter to wife "' and '"How am I to plant
trees, and make them grow up, and gather their fruits?" (from a story in
which, as the price of his daughter's hand, the father requires the
suitor to plant trees in the morning and gather their fruits in the
evening).' One can almost reconstruct a story out of 'We are forty cats;
three are black, one is white' (p. 411), . . . "'Very early we go to the
bath, and we strip ourselves naked, we take off our skins, and we become
human beings" (a story of forty pretty women turned into cats),' (p.
367), and '"When we are in the bath take the skins and fling them in the
fire"' (p. 368; *cf*. also p. 537). That story should belong to the
husk-myth or swan-maiden type, as should also perhaps this passage on p.
381 "Why did you go off?" "There was a man." "There was no man: a stick
fell from the tree" (a story in which a man surprises three maidens at
the bath. Two go off, but the third, whom the man is in love with,
remains behind, and she holds this discourse with her sisters as they go
home).' Cats are pretty often referred to--*e.g.* 'The cat found a shop
where they sold honey. She dipped her tail in it, and then rolled it in
the ashes' (p. 344); 'The cat sat down near them; she sees they are
flinging away the precious stone with the guts of the fish that had
swallowed it' (p. 189); 'The queen said to the lame cat' (p. 195); and
'The lame cat said to the lad, "I'll give you a bit of advice"' (p.
245). To the same story--perhaps a version of the well-known 'Silly
Women'--certainly belong 'His wife said, "Wait a bit till they put him
in the coffin"' (p. 295) and 'They put him in the coffin; he rose up in
the coffin; and his wife said, "Hold! my husband who was in the coffin,
is alive"' (p. 227); and to the same story (? 'Ali Baba') doubtfully,
these two passages: 'He packed the riches on his horses, and brought
them at midnight to his house, and he became a rich man' (p. 349) and
'He sat down and sewed up the belly of his brother, whom the robbers had
killed' (p. 422). Finally, some passages picked almost at random, to
illustrate the wealth of Paspati's collections, are, on p. 472, 'He is
the son of the King of the Serpents'; on p. 582, 'I pray you earnestly,
O my wise king, have all the doors shut, and let no man come in, and
none go out' (? 'Master Thief'); on p. 195, 'The King of India said, "I
have no son"'; on p. 564, 'She went into the forest, she found a
shepherd, and she changed clothes with the shepherd, and took the road:
she went walking on a whole month'; on p. 505, 'One taper burnt at her
head, the other at her feet' (? a 'Sleeping Beauty' story); on p. 170,
'I heard him, and I became a devil'; on p. 302, 'She took a sword and an
arrow, and set off. She did

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

not wish any one, even her sisters, to know of her departure'; on p.
250, 'The girl dressed herself, mounted her horse, and took her sword';
on p. 251, 'I become a bird for thee, O apple of my eyes'; on p. 291, 'I
shall become a swallow, I shall sit on thy neck, to kiss the freckle
upon thy cheek'; on p. 259, 'Said the lad, "Who has taken my black
bird?"'; on p. 356, 'They lay down: the lad placed the sword between
himself and the maiden' (*cf*. Grimm's No. 60, i. 262); on p. 421, 'The
old man said, "I give you forty days to find me"'; on p. 310, 'The ass
said, "All these years we have been with you, and to me you give bones
to eat, and the dog has had to eat straw"' <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](gft032.htm#fn_20.md); and on p. 362, ' The dead man
goes last, the *khodja* goes in front.'

They are not very lively reading, these little scraps; still, they
considerably extend our knowledge of Tchinghiané folk-tales. Of the six
stories given in full by Paspati I have had to omit two. One of these,
told by Christian nomads in the mixed style, is mixed indeed, more
incoherent than the tale of the Great Panjandrum, as witness this
sample:--'The godfather sees her with flowers on her head. Song, "The
wolf will eat the lamb; The wolf will eat the turkey; The cat hit the
bear; A stranger was alarmed."' The other story, told by one of the wild
Zapáris, opens with a boon granted by an old man to the youngest of a
king's five sons, to possess all the holes in the country. 'He went; in
the forest he went; he found a hole. He stooped down over the hole.
"Come out of the hole, whoever is inside." A woman came out; he asked
her, "What are you doing down there?" "There are two wolves; I feed
them." "Feed them well; God be with you." "And with you also." Again he
went and went; he found a hole, and stooped down over that hole. "Come
out of the hole." Out came a blackamoor,' etc. It is not a bad opening,
but the story wanders off into drivel and obscenity. Even of the four
tales I do give, one, the 'Story of the Bridge,' is valuable solely for
its theme, of the master-builder Manóli and his wife; if it is as old as
it is corrupt, it should be of hoary antiquity. But the three others are
really good folk-tales, versions of 'The Grateful Dead,' 'Faithful
John,' and Campbell of Islay's 'Knight of Riddles.' As always wherever
possible, my translations are made direct from the original Rómani.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_19"></span>[xlix:1](gft031.htm#fr_19.md) Since writing this, I
have learned, through the kindness of Mr. Rufus B. Richardson of the
American School of Classical Studies at Athens, that 'nothing remains of
Paspati's collections except a few notes, which will be brought out in a
new edition of his works.'
