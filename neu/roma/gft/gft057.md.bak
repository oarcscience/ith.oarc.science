Textual Heritage

### Gypsy story-tellers.

Campbell of Islay has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller in
London, and Paspati has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller, the
grandson of one at Constantinople. That is not much, perhaps; but there
are several more indications of the transmission of folk-tales by
Gypsies. *Bakht*, the Rómani word for 'luck' or 'fortune,' has passed,
not merely into Albanian folk-tales, but into the Greek and Turkish
languages, as I show in a footnote on [p. 53](gft072.htm#page_53.md); and a
good many of the following seventy-six stories seem to show unmistakable
tokens of the practised raconteur's art. 'Let us leave the dogs, and
return to the girl,' in [No. 47](gft107.htm#an_47.md); 'Now we'll leave the
master to stand a bit, and go back to the mother,' in [No.
68](gft128.htm#an_68.md); 'And I came away, told the story,' in Nos.
[6](gft066.htm#an_06), [7](gft067.htm#an_07), [8](gft068.htm#an_08.md), and
[15](gft075.htm#an_15.md); 'And I left them there, and came and told my
story to your lordships,' in [No. 10](gft070.htm#an_10.md); 'I was there,
and heard everything that happened,' in [No. 12](gft072.htm#an_12.md);
'Away I came, the tale have told,' in [No. 18](gft078.htm#an_18.md); 'Now
you've got it,' in [No. 28](gft088.htm#an_28.md); 'If they are not dead,
they are still alive,' in Nos. [41](gft101.htm#an_41.md) and
[42](gft102.htm#an_42.md), and also in Hungarian-Gypsy stories; 'The floor
there was made of paper, and I came away here,' in [No.
43](gft103.htm#an_43.md); 'So if they are not dead, they are living
together,' in [No. 44](gft104.htm#an_44.md); 'Excuse me for saying it,' in
[No. 55](gft115.htm#an_55); 'She was delivered (pray, excuse me.md) of a
boy,' in [No. 46](gft106.htm#an_46.md); 'And the last time I was there I
played my harp for them, and got to go again,' in [No.
54](gft114.htm#an_54.md)--these all sound like tags or formulas of the
professional story-teller. Léon Zafiri's usual wind-up, says Paspati (p.
421), ran: 'And I too, I was there, and I ate, and I drank, and I have
come to tell you the story.'
