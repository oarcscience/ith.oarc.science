### No. 56.--The Five Trades

Once there were a sailor and other four men. One was a smith, and the
other was a soldier and a tailor, and the last was an innkeeper. The
sailor asked the smith to come upon the sea. The smith said, 'No, I must
go and do some work.' 'What is your work?' 'To heat iron,' says the
smith, and make it into shoes for horses.' The sailor asked the other
three to come on board his ship. The soldier said he must go to make
facings and marchings; and the tailor said, 'I must go and make clothes
to keep you warm.' And the innkeeper said, 'I am going to make beer to
make you drunk, that you may all of you go to the devil.' That's all of
that.

is one of the very few Gypsy stories with a moral.</span>
