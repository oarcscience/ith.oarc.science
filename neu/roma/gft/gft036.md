*Gypsy Folk Tales*, by Francis Hindes Groome, \[1899\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dr. Kopernicki.

Isidore Kopernicki, M.D. (1825-91), published in 1872 a German monograph
on Gypsy craniology, and, called from Bucharest to Cracow in 1870,
collected thirty Polish- Gypsy folk-tales in 1875-77. A year or two
before his death he

<span id="page_lv">p. lv</span>

put out a prospectus of a projected work on Rómani stories and songs,
with a French translation; but the work never found a publisher. Six,
however, of his stories appeared in the *Gypsy Lore Journal*, and are
reproduced here, Nos. [45](gft105.htm#an_45)-[50](gft110.htm#an_50.md).
They are one and all so admirable as stories and valuable as folklore
that I cannot but hope some folklore society or some individual
folklorist may purchase and publish the entire collection--Madame
Kopernicki, I believe, is still a resident of Cracow.
