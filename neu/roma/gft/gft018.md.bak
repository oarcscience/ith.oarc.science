### Athingani.

From whatever cause, it seems certain that a confusion did exist between
the Ἀτσίγκανοι, or Gypsies, and the Ἀθίγγανοι, or heretics forming a
branch of the Manichæan sect of the Paulicians, which renders it
sometimes extremely difficult to determine whom the Byzantine historians
are speaking of in seven passages collected by Dr. Franz von Miklosich
in his great work, *Ueber die Mundarten and die Wanderungen der Zigeuner
Europa's* (part vi., 1876, Vienna, pp. 57-64). It appears from these
that the Athingani, described as magicians, soothsayers, and
serpent-charmers, first emerge in Byzantine history under Nicephorus I.

banished by Michael I. (811-13), and were restored to favour by Michael
II. (820-29). But Miklosich's grounds for absolutely identifying them
with Gypsies, and positively asserting the latter to have appeared at
Byzantium in 810 under Nicephorus, are hard to recognise.
