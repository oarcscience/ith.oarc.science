### No. 4.--Story of the Bridge

In olden days there were twelve brothers. And the eldest brother, the
carpenter Manoli, was making the long bridge. One side he makes; one
side falls. The twelve brothers had one mistress, and they all had to do
with her. They called her to them, 'Dear bride.' On her head was the
tray; in her hands was a child. Whoseso wife came first, she will come
to the twelve brothers. Manoli's wife, Lénga, will come to the twelve
brothers. Said his wife, 'Thou hast not eaten bread with me. What has
befallen thee that thou eatest not bread with me? My ring has fallen
into the water. Go and fetch my ring.' Her husband said, 'I will fetch
thy ring out of the water.' Up to his two breasts came the water in the
depth of the bridge there. He came into the fountain, he was drowned.
Beneath he became a talisman, the innermost foundation of the bridge.
Manoli's eyes became the great open arch of the bridge. 'God send a wind
to blow, that the tray may fall from the head of her who bears it in
front of Lénga.' A snake crept out before Lénga, and she feared, and
said, 'Now have I fear at sight of the snake, and am sick. Now is it not
bad for my

children?' Another man seized her, and sought to drown her, Manoli's
wife. She said, 'Drown me not in the water. I have little children.' She
bowed herself over the sea, where the carpenter Manoli made the bridge.
Another man called Manoli's wife; with him she went on the road. There,
when they went on the road, he went to the tavern, he was weary; the man
went, drank the juice of the grape, got drunk. Before getting home, he
killed Manoli's wife, Lénga.

<span class="small">I hesitated whether to give this story; it is so
hopelessly corrupt, it seems such absolute nonsense. Yet it enshrines
beyond question, however confusedly, the widespread and ancient belief
that to ensure one's foundation one should wall up a human victim. So
St. Columba buried St. Oran alive in the foundation of his monastery; in
Western folklore, however, the victim is usually an infant--a bastard
sometimes, in one case (near Göttingen) a deaf-mute. But in
south-eastern Europe it is almost always a woman----the wife of the
master-builder, whose name, as here, is Manoli. Reinhold Köhler has
treated the subject admirably in his *Aufsätze über Märchen and
Volkslieder* (Berlin, 1894, pp. 36-47); there one finds much to
enlighten the darkness of our original. 'God send a wind,' etc., is the
husband's prayer as he sees his wife coming towards him, and hopes to
avert her doom; 'My ring has fallen into the water,' etc., must also be
his utterance, when he finds that it is hope-less, that she has to die.
The Gypsy story is probably of high antiquity, for two at least of the
words in it were quite or almost meaningless to the nomade Gypsy who
told it (Paspati, p. 190). The masons of south-eastern Europe are, it
should be noticed, largely Gypsies; and a striking Indian parallel may
be pointed out in the Santal story of 'Seven Brothers and their Sister'
(Campbell's *Santal Folk-tales*, pp. 106-110). Here seven brothers set
to work to dig a tank, but find no water, so, by the advice of a yogi,
give their only sister to the spirit of the tank. 'The tank was soon
full to the brim, and the girl was drowned.' And then comes a curious
mention of a Dom, or Indian vagrant musician, whose name is probably
identical with *Doum*, *Lom*, or *Rom*, the Gypsy of Syria, Asia Minor,
and Europe.</span>
