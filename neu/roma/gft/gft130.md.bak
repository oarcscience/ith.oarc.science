### No. 70.--The Tinker and his Wife

Once there was a tinker and his wife, and they got into a bit of very
good country for yernin’ a few shillings quick. And in this country
there wasn't very little lodgings. 'Well, my wench,' he said to his
wife, 'I think we'll go and take that little empty house, and keep a
little beer. Well, my wench, I'll order for a barrel of beer.' He has
this barrel of beer in the house. 'Now, my wench, you make the biggest
penny out of it as ever you can, and I'll go off for another week's
walk.'

In the course of one day a packman come by. He says, 'It's gettin' very
warm, missus, isn't it?'

'No, indeed,' she says, 'it's very cold weather.'

'I've got a very big load, and it makes me sweat, and I think it's
warm.'

'I sell beer here,' she says.

He says, 'Well, God bless you, put me a drop for this penny.'

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

It was one of the old big pennies, and was the biggest penny she ever
saw there. She brought him all the barrel for it. So she takes the penny
and drops it in the basin on the mantel-shelf. He was there three days
drinking till he emptied the barrel of beer. The husband comes home at
the end of the week.

'Well, my wench, how did you get on?'

'Well, Jack, I did very well. I sold every drop of beer.'

'Well done, my wench, we'll have another one and see how that goes. Now,
my wench, bring them few shillin's down, and let's see what you made
upon it.'

She brings the basin down, and says, 'You telled me to make the biggest
penny on it as ever I could.'

He begin to count it, and turns the basin upside down, and empties it on
the table. And what was there but the one big penny?

'Well! well!! well!!!' he says, 'you'll ruin me now for life.'

'Ah!' she says, 'Jack, didn't you tell me to make the biggest penny out
of it as ever I could, and that was the biggest penny as ever I seen.'

'Well,' he says, 'my wench, I see you don't understand sellin’ beer. I
think I'll buy a little pig. We've got plenty of taters and cabbage in
the garden. Well, now, my wench, when the butcher comes round to kill
the pig, you walk round the garden and count every cabbage that's in the
garden, and you get a little stick, and stick it by every cabbage in the
garden, and when the butcher slays the pig up, you revide a piece of pig
up for every cabbage in the garden.'

She revided a piece of pig up for every cabbage in the garden, and stuck
it on every stick round the cabbages. The husband comes home again.

'Well, my wife, how did you go on with the pig?'

'Well, Jack, I done as you told me,' she says. 'I got a stick and stuck
it by every cabbage, and put a piece of mate on every stick.'

'Well! well!! well!!!' he says, 'where is the mate gone to now? You'll
ruin me if I stop here much longer. Pull the fire out,' he says, 'and
I'll get away from here.' And he picks up his basket and throws it on
his shoulder. 'Pull that door after you,' he says.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

What did she do but she pulls all the fire out and put it into her
apron. The old door of the house was tumbling down, and she picks it up
and put it on her back. So him being into a temper, he didn't take much
notice of her behind him. They travelled on, and it come very dark. They
comes to an old hollow tree by the side of the road.

'Well, my wench, I think we'll stop here to-night.'

They goes up to the top of the old tree. After they got up in the tree,
the robbers got underneath them.

'Whatever you do, my wench, keep quiet. This is a robbers' den.'

The robbers had plenty of meat and everything, and they prayed for a bit
of fire.

She says, 'Jack,' she says, 'I shall have to drop it.'

So she drops the fire out of her apron, and it goed down the hollow
tree.

'See, what a godsend that is,' said one.

They cooked the meat as they had. 'The Lord send me a drop of vinegar,'
says one.

'Thank God for that,' says that other one. 'See what a godsend ’tis to
us.'

Now, the door's fastened to her back yet, and she says, 'Jack, I shall
have to drop it.'

'Drop what?' he says.

'I shall have to drop the door, Jack,' she says, 'the rope's cutting my
shoulders in two.'

So she drop the door down the hollow tree, and it went
dummel-tummel-tummel down the tree, and these robbers thought ’twas the
devil himself coming. They jumps up, and away they goes down the road as
hard as ever they could go. .The time as they run, Jack's wife goes down
the tree and picks up the bag of gold what they'd left. Being frightened
as they'd had such godsends to ’em, they left all behind.

They had one brother as was deaf and dumb. Him being a very
valuable <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) fellow, he thought he'd
come back to see what was the matter. He come peepin’ round the old
tree. Who happened to see him but Jack's wife. And he went 'A a a a a a'
to her.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

'Come here,' she says, 'I can cure your speech.'

She made motions with her own mouth for him to put his tongue out. She
drew the knife slightly from behind her as he put his tongue out, and
cut half of his tongue off. Him being bleeding, he went
'Awa wa wa wa wa,' putting his hand to his mouth and making motions to
his brothers. And when he got back to his brothers, them seeing him
bleeding, they thought sure the devil was there.

I never see Jack nor his wife nor the robbers sense after they left the
tree.
