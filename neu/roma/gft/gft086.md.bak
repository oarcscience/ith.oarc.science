### No. 26.--The Winged Hero

There was a certain great craftsman, and he was rich. He took to
drinking and gambling, and drank away all his wealth, and grew poor, so
that he had nothing to eat. He saw a dream, that he should make himself
wings; and he made himself wings, and screwed them on, and flew to the
Ninth Region, to the emperor's castle, and lighted down And the
emperor's son went forth to meet him, and asked him, 'Where do you come
from, my man?'

'I come from afar.'

'Sell me your wings.'

'I will.'

'What do you want for them?'

'A thousand gold pieces.'

And he gave him them, and said to him, 'Go home with the wings, and come
back in a month's time.'

He flew home, and came back in a month; and the prince said to him,
'Screw the wings on to me.'

And he screwed them on, and wrote down for the prince which peg he was
to turn to fly, and which peg he was to turn to alight. The prince flew
a little, and let himself down on the ground, and gave him another
thousand florins more, and gave him also a horse, that he might ride
home. The prince screwed on the wings, and flew to the south. A wind
arose from the south, and tossed the trees, and drove him to the north.
In the north dwelt the wind, drove him to the Ninth Region. And a fire
was shining in the city. And he lighted down on the earth, and unscrewed
his wings, and folded them by his side, and came into the house. There
was an old woman, and he asked for food. She gave him a dry crust, and
he ate it not. He lay down and slept. And in the morning he wrote a
letter for her, and gave her money, and sent her to a cookshop with a
letter to the cookshop to give him good food. And the old woman came
home, and gave him to eat, and he also gave to the old woman. He went
outside, and saw the emperor's palace with three stories of stone and
the fourth of glass. And he asked the old woman, 'Who lives in the
palace? and who lives in the fourth story?'

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

'The emperor's daughter lives there. He won't let her go out. He gives
her her food there by a rope.'

And the maid-servant lowered the rope, and they fastened the victuals to
it, and she drew them up by the rope. And the maid-servant had a
bedchamber apart, where she slept only of a night, and the day she
passed with the princess.

And that emperor's son screwed on his wings and flew up, flew to the
glass house, and he looked to see how the bars opened, and opened them,
and let himself in. And she was lying lifeless on the bed. And he shakes
her, and she never speaks. And he took the candle from her head; and she
arose, and embraced him, and said to him, 'Since you are come to me, you
are mine, and I am yours.' They loved one another till daybreak; then he
went out, placed the candle at her head, and she was dead. And he closed
the bars again, and flew back to the old woman.

Half a year he visited the princess. She fell with child. The
maid-servant noticed that she was growing big, and her clothes did not
fit her. She wrote a letter to the emperor: 'What will this be, that
your daughter is big?' The emperor wrote back a letter to her: 'Smear
the floor at night with dough, and whoever comes will leave his mark on
the floor.' She placed the candle at her head, and the girl lay dead.
And she smeared the floor with dough, and went to her chamber. The
emperor's son came again to her, and let himself in to her, and never
noticed they had smeared the floor, and made footprints with his shoes,
and the dough stuck to his shoes, but he never noticed it, and went home
to the old woman, and lay down and slept. The servant-maid went to the
emperor's daughter, and saw the footprints, and wrote a letter to the
emperor, and took the measure of the footprints, and sent it to the
emperor. The emperor summoned two servants, and gave them a letter, and
gave them the measure of the footprints. 'Whose shoes the measure shall
fit, bring him to me.' They traversed the whole city, and found nothing.

And one said, 'Let's try the old woman's.'

And another said, 'No, there's nobody there.'

'Stay here. I'll go.'

And he saw him sleeping, and applied the measure to his shoes. They
summoned him. 'Come to the emperor.'

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

'All right.'

He bought himself a great cloak, and put it on, so that his wings might
not be noticed, and went to the emperor. The emperor asked him, 'Have
you been going to my daughter?'

'I have.'

'With what purpose have you done so?'

'I want to marry her.'

The emperor said, 'Bah! you'll not marry her, for I'll burn you both
with thorns.'

The emperor commanded his servants, and they gathered three loads of
thorns, and set them on fire, and lowered her down, to put them both on
the fire. The emperor's son asked, 'Allow us to say a *pater noster*.'
He said to the girl, 'When I fall on my knees, do you creep under the
cloak and clasp me round the neck, for I'll fly upwards with you.'

She clasped him round the neck, and quickly he screwed the wings, and
flew upwards. The cloak flew off, the soldiers fired their guns at it;
on he flew. She cried, 'Let yourself down, for I shall bear a child.'

He said, 'Hold out.'

He flew further, and alighted on a rock on a mountain, and she brought
forth a child there. She said, 'Make a fire.' He saw a fire in a field
afar off. He screwed his wings, and flew to the fire, and took a brand
of it, and returned. And a spark fell on one wing, and the wing caught
fire. Just as he was under the mountain the wing fell off, and he flung
away the other one as well. And he walked round the mountain, and could
not ascend it.

And God came to him and said, 'Why weepest thou?' Ah! how should I not
weep? for I cannot ascend the mountain, and my wife has brought forth a
child.'

'What will you give me if I carry you up to the top?'

'I will give you whatever you want.'

'Will you give me what is dearest to you?'

'I will.'

'Let us make an agreement.'

They made one. God cast him into a deep sleep, and her as well, and God
bore them home to his father's, to his own bed, and left them there, and
departed. And the child cried. The warders heard a child crying in the
bedchamber.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They went and
opened the door, and recognised him, the emperor's son. And they went to
the emperor and told him, Your son has come, O emperor.'

'Call him to me.'

They came to the emperor; they bowed themselves before him; they tarried
there a year. The boy grew big, and was playing one day. The emperor and
the empress went to church, and his nurse too went to the church. God
came, disguised like a beggar. The emperor's son said to the little lad,
'Take a handful of money, and give it to the beggar.'

The beggar said, 'I don't want this money; it's bad. Tell your father to
give me what he vowed he would.'

The emperor's son was angry, and he took his sword in his hand, and went
to the old man to kill him. The old man took the sword into his own hand
and said, 'Give me what you swore to me--the child, you know--when you
were weeping under the mountain.'

'I will give you money, I will not give you the child.'

God took the child by the head, and the father took him by the feet, and
they tugged, and God cut the child in half.

'One half for you, and one half for me.'

'Now you've killed him, I don't want him. Take him and be hanged to
you.'

God took him, and went outside, and put him together; and he was healed,
and lived again.

'Do you take him now.'

For God cut off his sins.

<span class="small">Of this story, widely familiar through H. C.
Andersen's 'Flying Trunk,' Wlislocki furnishes a Transylvanian-Gypsy
variant, 'The Wooden Bird,' in his 'Beiträge zu Benfey's Pantschatantra'
(*Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl. Gesellschaft*, vol. xxxii. 1888,
part i. p. 119). For that variant and many others--Persian, Hindu,
Modern Greek, etc., including 'Der Weber als Wischnu' from Benfey, i.
159-163, ii. 48-56, see W. A. Clouston's *Notes on the Magical Elements
in Chaucer's 'Squire's Tale,' and Analogues* (Chaucer Soc. 1890, pp.
413-471). *Cf*. also Grimm's 'Blue Light,' No. 116; Hahn, No. 15, and
ii. 269, for tower of glass or crystal; Cosquin, No. 31; and Hahn, ii.
186, for a king who governs nine kingdoms. With the princess lying
lifeless on the bed compare the lady sleeping on a golden bedstead in
Lal Behari Day's *Folk-tales of Bengal*, p. 251. In 'The Demon and the
King's Son' (Maive Stokes's *Indian Fairy Tales*, p. 186), the demon
every day makes his daughter lie on her bed, and covers her with a
sheet, and</span>

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="small">places a thick stick at her head, and another at her
feet. Then she dies till he comes home in the evening and changes the
sticks. This brings her to life again. *Cf*. also notes to our
Welsh-Gypsy story of 'An Old King and his three Sons' ([No.
55](gft115.htm#an_55).md).</span>
