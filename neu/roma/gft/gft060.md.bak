*Gypsy Folk Tales*, by Francis Hindes Groome, \[1899\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### Theory.

To recapitulate, my theory, then, is this:--The Gypsies quitted India at
an unknown date, probably taking with them some scores of Indian
folk-tales, as they certainly took with them many hundreds of Indian
words. By way of Persia and Armenia, they arrived in the Greek-speaking
Balkan Peninsula, and tarried there for several centuries, probably
disseminating their Indian folk-tales, and themselves picking up Greek
folk-tales, as they certainly gave Greek the Rómani word *bakht*,
'fortune,' and borrowed from it *paramísi*, 'story,' and about a hundred
more terms. From the Balkan Peninsula they have spread since 1417, or
possibly earlier, to Siberia, Norway, Scotland, Wales, Spain, Brazil,
and the countries between, everywhere probably disseminating the
folk-tales they started with and those they picked up by the way, and
everywhere probably adding to their store. Thus, I take it, they picked
up the complete Rhampsinitus story in the Balkan Peninsula, and carried
it thence to Roumania and Scotland; in

<span id="page_lxxxiii">p. lxxxiii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scotland, if John
MacDonald was any sort of a Gypsy, they seem to have picked up 'Osean
after the Feen.'

It is not so smooth and rounded a theory as I hoped to be able to
present to folklorists, or as I might easily have made it by suppressing
a little here and filling out somewhat there. But at least I have
pointed out a few fresh parallels; I have, thanks to Mr. Sampson's
generosity, enriched our stock, not of English folk-tales, but of
folk-tales collected in England and Wales; <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) and I have, I hope, stimulated a measure
of curiosity in the strange, likeable, uncanny race, whom 'Hans
Breitmann' has happily designated 'the Colporteurs of Folklore.' I let
my little theory go reluctantly, but invite the fullest argument and
discussion. There is nothing like argument. I was once at a meeting of a
Learned Society, where a friend of mine read a most admirable paper.
Then uprose another member of that Learned Society, and challenged his
every contention. In a rich, sonorous voice he thus began: 'Max Müller
has said (and I agree with Max Müller), that Sanskrit in dying left
twins--Chinese and Semitic.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_36"></span>[lxxxiii:1](gft060.htm#fr_36.md) Only four years
ago Mr. Joseph Jacobs wrote: 'It is at any rate clear, that the only
considerable addition to our folklore knowledge in these isles must come
from the Gaelic area.' And since then a folklorist has expressed himself
in the *Athenæum* as 'pretty certain that as to complete stories of any
length there are none such to be found in Wales at the present day.'
