### Possible Gypsy influences.

I have told English Gypsies Grimm's tale of 'The Hare and the Hedgehog,'
and they always pronounce that it must be a Rómani story ('Who else
would have gone for to make up a tale about hedgehogs?') <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) But the question whether in many non-Gypsy
collections there are not a number of folk-tales that present strong
internal evidence of their Gypsy origin is a difficult question; it
would take us too far afield, and could lead to no really definite
results. Still, I must say a word or two. In Hahn's fine variant (ii.
267) of our 'Mare's Son' from the island of Syra a vizier travels from
town to town, seeking a lad as handsome as the prince. At last he is
passing through a Gypsy quarter, <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md)
when he hears a boy singing: 'his voice was beautiful as any
nightingale's.' He looks through a door, and sees a boy, who is every
whit as handsome as the prince, so he purchases this boy, and the boy
plays a leading part in the story. The abject contempt in which Gypsies
are held throughout the whole of south-eastern Europe renders it
probable that none but a Gypsy would thus have described a member of the
race. The story, too, from its opening clause, a greeting to the 'goodly
company,' would seem to have, been told by

<span id="page_lxxxii">p. lxxxii</span>

a professional story-teller--a kinsman, possibly, of Léon Zafiri.
Krauss's Croatian story (No. 98) of 'The Gypsy and the Nine Franciscans'
is just 'Les Trois Bossus' of the trouvère Durant (Liebrecht's *Dunlop*,
p. 209); yet it has, to my thinking, a thoroughly Rómani ring. In
Campbell's Gaelic story of 'The Young King of Easaidh Ruadh' (No. 1) the
hero's young wife is carried off by a giant, and, following their track,
he comes thrice on the site of a fire. If I were telling that story to
Gypsies, I should say, not site of a fire, but fireplace: I fancy I can
hear the Gypsies' exclamations--'Dere! my blessed! following de
fireplaces. Course he'd know den which way de giant had gone.' I could
cite a good score of similar instances; but I will content myself with
this footnote from Scott's *Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border* (ed.
1873, iv. 102):--'Besides the prophetic powers ascribed to the Gypsies
in most European countries, the Scottish peasants believe them possessed
of the power of throwing upon bystanders a spell, and causing them to
see the thing that is not. . . . The receipt to prevent the operation of
these deceptions was to use a sprig of four-leaved clover. I remember to
have heard (certainly very long ago, for at that time I believed the
legend), that a Gypsy exercised his glamour over a number of persons at
Haddington, to whom he exhibited a common dunghill cock, trailing what
appeared to the spectators a massy oaken trunk. An old man passed with a
cart of clover; he stopped, and picked out a four-leaved blade; the eyes
of the spectators were opened,--and the oaken trunk appeared to be a
bulrush.' But that is just Grimm's No. 149, 'The Beam': what folklorist
has ever associated 'The Beam' with the Gypsies?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_34"></span>[lxxxi:1](gft059.htm#fr_34.md) For an excursus, of
true German erudition, on Gypsies and hedgehogs, see R. Pischel's
*Beiträge zur Kenntniss der deutschen Zigeuner* (Halle, 1894, pp.
26-30). He shows that hedgehogs are a Gypsy delicacy from Wales to
Odessa, and that the Gypsies probably brought the taste from the
foothills of the Himalayas, where hedgehogs are plentiful.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[lxxxi:2](gft059.htm#fr_35.md) 'Γυφτικά' says Hahn
in a footnote. 'The sedentary Gypsies as a rule are smiths, therefore
*Gypsy* and Lock*smith* are synonymous in the towns,'
