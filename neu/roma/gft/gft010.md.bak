### In South America.

For South America our information was, quite recently, even more meagre.
Twenty years ago I just knew from Henry Koster's *Travels in Brazil*
(Lond. 1816, p. 399) of the presence of Ciganos there, whom he described
as ' a people of a brownish cast, with features which resemble those of
white persons, and tall and handsome. They wander from place to place in
parties of men, women, and children, exchanging, buying, and selling
horses, and gold and silver trinkets. . . . They are said to be
unmindful of all religious observances, and never to hear Mass or
confess their sins. It is likewise said that they never marry out of
their own nation.' Since then, however, Mello Moraes has published *Os
Ciganos no Brazil* (Rio de Janeiro, 1886), which, besides a Rómani
glossary, gives a good historical and statistical account of the
Brazilian Gypsies. They seem to be the descendants of Ciganos
transported from Portugal towards the close of the seventeenth and the
beginning of the eighteenth century. Thus, by a decree of 27th August
1685, the Gypsies were henceforth to be transported to Maranhão, instead
of to Africa; and in 1718, by a decree of 11th April, the Gypsies were
banished from the kingdom to the city of Bahia, special orders being
given to the governor to be diligent in the prohibition of the language
and 'cant ' (*giria*), not permitting them to teach it to their
children, that so it might die out. It was about this time, according to
'Sr. Pinto Noites, an estimable and venerable Gypsy of eighty-nine
years,' that his ancestors and kinsfolk arrived at Rio de Janeiro--nine
families transported hither by reason of a robbery imputed to the
Gypsies.

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The heads of these
nine families were João da Costa Ramos, called João do Reino, with his
son, Fernando da Costa Ramos, and his wife, Dona Eugenia; Luis Rabello
de Aragão; one Ricardo Frago, who went to Minas; Antonio Laço, with his
wife, Jacintha Laço; the Count of Cantanhede; Manoel Cabral and Antonio
Curto, who settled in Bahia, accompanied by daughters-in-law,
sons-in-law, and grandchildren, as well as by wife and sons. They
applied themselves to metallurgy--were tinkers, farriers, braziers, and
goldsmiths; the women told fortunes and gave charms to avert the evil
eye. In the first half of the nineteenth century the Brazilian Gypsies
seem to have been great slave-dealers, just as their brethren on this
side of the Atlantic have always been great dealers in horses and asses.
We read on p. 40 of 'M . . ., afterwards Marquis of B . . ., belonging
to the Bohemian race, whose immense fortune proceeded from his acting as
middleman in the purchase of slaves for Minas.' And there are several
more indications, scattered through the book, that the Brazilian nation,
from highest to lowest, must be strongly tinctured with Rómani blood. We
know far too little about the Chinganéros or Montanéros, wandering
minstrels of Venezuela, to identify them more or less vaguely with
Gypsies (*Gypsy Lore Journal*, i. 306, 373); and a like remark applies,
even more strongly, to the Lowbeys of Gambia, who have been described as
the 'Gypsies of North-West Africa,' who never intermarry with another
race, and who confine themselves almost exclusively to the making of the
various wooden utensils in use by natives generally (*ib*. i. 54).
Still, these Lowbeys *may* be the descendants of Gypsies transported
from Portugal, or of the Basque Gypsies, whole bands of whom so lately
as 1802 were caught by night as in a net, huddled on shipboard, and
landed on the coast of Africa (Michel's *Pays Basque*, p. 137).
