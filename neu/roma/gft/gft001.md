### 'PAZORRHUS'

I AM no folklorist; I have merely dabbled in folklore as a branch of the
great Egyptian Question, which includes also intricate problems of
philology, ethnology, craniology, archæology, history, music, and what
not besides. But for twenty years I have been trying to interest
folklorists in Gypsy folk-tales. Vainly so far; and during those twenty
years there have died Dr. Paspati, Dr. Barbu Constantinescu, Dr. Franz
von Miklosich, Dr. Isidore Kopernicki, M. Paul Bataillard, and John
Roberts, the Welsh-Gypsy harper: with them much has perished that
folklorists should not have willingly let go. Meanwhile, however, a
Rómani Grimm has arisen in Mr. John Sampson, the librarian of University
College, Liverpool. With unparalleled generosity he has placed his
collections at my free disposal--I trust I have not made too lavish use
of them,--and has read, moreover, every page of the proofs of this
volume, enriching it from the depths of his knowledge of 'matters of
Egypt.' Another, a very old friend, to whom my debt is great, is the
Rev. Thomas Davidson, author of the admirable folklore articles in
*Chambers's Encyclopædia*; he has lent me scores of scarce works from
his unrivalled folklore library. Others to whom I owe acknowledgments
are: Mr. Tom Taylor, Mr. W. R. S. Ralston, Mr. W. A. Clouston, Dr. Hyde
Clarke, Professor Bensly (all five also dead), Mrs. Gomme, Mr. H. Browne
of Bucharest, Mr. Robert Burns, Lord Archibald Campbell, Mr. Archibald
Constable, Mr. H. T. Crofton,

Dobschütz of Jena, Mr. Fitzedward Hall, Dean Kitchin, Mr. William
Larminie, Mr. David MacRitchie, M. Omont of the Bibliothèque Nationale,
Dr. David Patrick, Dr. Fearon Ranking, Mr. Rufus B. Richardson of
Athens, Professor Sayce, and Dr. Rudolf von Sowa of Brünn. And, finally,
I would thank in advance whoever may send me corrections, additions, or
suggestions on the subject of Gypsy folk-tales.
