### In North America.

As to America it was till recently supposed that there were not, had
never been, any Gypsies there. In 'The Fortune-teller,' a story
reprinted in *Chambers's Journal* for November 25, 1843, from *The
Lady's Book*, an American publication, a Mrs. Somers is made to exclaim,
'An English gipsy! Alice, you must be deceived. There never has been a
gipsy in America.' And, sure enough, the fortune-teller turns out to be
no Gypsy. Nay, in a work so well-informed as Appleton's

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *American
Cyclopædia* (1874), the writer of the article 'Gipsies' pronounces it
'questionable whether a band of genuine Gipsies has ever been in
America.' Yet in 1665 at Edinburgh the Privy Council gave warrant and
power to George Hutcheson, merchant, and his co-partners to transport to
Jamaica and Barbadoes Egyptians and other loose and dissolute persons;
and on 1st January 1715 nine Border Gypsies, men and women, of the names
of Faa, Stirling, Yorstoun, Finnick (Fenwick), Lindsey, Ross, and
Robertson, were transported by the magistrates of Glasgow to the
Virginia plantations at a cost of thirteen pounds sterling (*Gypsy Lore
Journal*, ii. 60-62). That is all, or practically all, we know of the
coming of the Gypsies to North America, where, at New York, there were
house-dwelling Gypsies as far back as 1850, and where to-day there must
be hundreds or thousands of the race from England, Scotland, Hungary,
Spain, one knows not whence else besides. Some day somebody will study
them and write about them; meanwhile we have merely stray jottings by
Simson and Leland.
