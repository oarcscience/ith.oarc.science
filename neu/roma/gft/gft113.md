### No. 53.--De Little Bull-calf

Centers of yeahs ago, when all de most part of de country wur a
wilderness place, deah wuz a little boy lived in a pooah bit of a
poverty <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) house. An’ dis boy's
father guv him a deah little bull-calf. De boy used to tink de wurl’ of
dis bull-calf, an’ his father gived him everyting he wanted fur it.

Afterward dat his father died, an’ his mother got married agin; an’ dis
wuz a werry wicious stepfather, an’ he couldn't abide dis little boy.
An’ at last he said, if de boy bring'd de bull-calf home agin, he wur
a-goin’ to kill it. Dis father should be a willint to dis deah little
boy, shouldn't he, my Sampson?

He used to gon out tentin’ his bull-calf every day wid barley bread. An’
arter dat deah wus an ole man comed to him, an’ we have a deal of
thought who Dat wuz, eh? An’ he d’rected de little boy, 'You an’ youah
bull-calf had better go away an’ seek youah forchants.'

So he wents an, an’ wents an, as fur as I can tell you to-morrow
night, <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md) an’ he wents up to a
farmhouse an’ begged a crust of bread, an’ when he comed back he broked
it in two, and guv half an it to his little bull-calf.

An’ he wents an to another house, an’ begs a bit of cheese crud, an’
when he comed back, he wants to gin half an it to his bull-calf.

'No,' de little bull-calf says, 'I'm a-goin’ acrost dis field into de
wild wood wilderness country, where dere’ll be tigers, lepers, wolfs,
monkeys, an’ a fiery dragin. An’ I shall kill dem every one excep’ de
fiery dragin, an’ he'll kill me.' (De Lord could make any animal speak
dose days. You know trees could speak wonst. Our blessed Lord He hid in
de eldon bush, an’ it tell’t an Him, an’ He says, 'You shall always
stink,' and so it always do. But de ivy let Him hide into it, and He
says, It should be green both winter an’ summer.) <span
id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117.md)

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

An’ dis little boy did cry, you 'ah shuah; and he says, 'O my little
bull-calf, I hope he won't kill you.'

'Yes, he will,' de little bull-calf says. 'An’ you climb up dat tree,
an’ den no one can come anigh you but de monkeys, an’ ef dey come de
cheese crud will sef you. An’ when I'm killt de dragin will go away fur
a bit. An’ you come down dis tree, an’ skin me, an’ get my biggest gut
out, an’ blow it up, an’ my gut will kill everyting as you hit wid it,
an’ when dat fiery dragin come, you hit it wid my gut, an’ den cut its
tongue out.' (We know deah were fiery dragins dose days, like George an’
his dragin in de Bible. But deah! it aren't de same wurl’ now. De wurl’
is tu’n’d ovah sence, like you tu’n’d it ovah wid a spade.)

In course he done as dis bull-calf tell’t him, an’ he climb’t up de
tree, an’ de monkeys climb’t up de tree to him. An’ he belt de cheese
crud in his hend, an’ he says, 'I'll squeeze youah heart like dis flint
stone.'

An’ de monkey cocked his eye, much to say, 'Ef you can squeeze a flint
stone an’ mek de juice come outer it, you can squeeze me.' An’ he never
spoked, for a monkey's cunning, <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md)
but down he went.

An’ de little bull-calf wuz fighting all dese wild tings on de groun’;
an’ de little boy wuz clappin' his hands up de tree an’ sayin’, 'Go an,
my little bull-calf! Well fit, my little bull-calf!' An’ he mastered
everyting barrin’ de fiery dragin. An’ de fiery dragin killt de little
bull-calf.

An’ he wents an, an’ saw a young lady, a king's darter, staked down by
de hair of her head. (Dey wuz werry savage dat time of day kings to deir
darters if dey misbehavioured demselfs, an’ she wuz put deah fur de
fiery dragin to ’stry her.)

An’ he sat down wid her several hours, an’ she says, 'Now, my deah
little boy, my time is come when I'm a-goin’ to be worried, an’ you'll
better go.'

An’ he says, 'No,' he says, 'I can master it, an’ I won't go.'

She begged an’ prayed an him as ever she could to get him away, but he
wouldn't go. An’ he could heah it comin' far enough, roarin’ an’ doin’.
An’ dis dragin come spitting fire, wid a tongue like a gret speart: an’
you could heah

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

it roarin’ fur milts; an’ dis place wheah de king's darter wur staked
down wuz his beat wheah he used to come. And when it comed, de little
boy hit dis gut about his face tell he wuz dead, but de fiery dragin
bited his front finger affer him. Den de little boy cut de fiery
dragin’s tongue out, an’ he says to de young lady, 'I've done all dat I
can, I mus’ leave you.' An’ you ’ah shuah she wuz sorry when he hed to
leave her, an’ she tied a dimant ring into his hair, an’ said good-bye
to him.

Now den, bime bye, de ole king comed up to de werry place where his
darter wuz staked by de hair of her head, ’mentin’ an’ doin’, an’
espectin’ to see not a bit of his darter, but de prents of de place
where she wuz. An’ he wuz disprised, an’ he says to his darter, 'How
come you seft?'

'Why, deah wuz a little boy comed heah an’ sef me, daddy.'

Den he untied her, an’ took’d her home to de palast, for you’ah shuah he
wor glad, when his temper comed to him agin. Well, he put it into all de
papers to want to know who seft dis gal, an’ ef de right man comed he
wur to marry her, an’ have his kingdom an’ all his destate. Well, deah
wuz gentlemen comed fun all an’ all parts of England, wid deir front
fingers cut aff, an’ all an’ all kinds of tongues--foreign tongues, an’
beastès’ tongues, an’ wile animals' tongues. Dey cut all sorts of
tongues out, an’ dey went about shootin’ tings a-purpose, but dey never
could find a dragin to shoot. Deah wuz genlemen comin' every other day
wid tongues an’ dimant rings; but when dey showed deir tongues, it
warn’t de right one, an’ dey got turn’t aff.

An’ dis little ragged boy comed up a time or two werry desolated like;
an’ she had an eye on him, an’ she looked at dis boy, tell her father
got werry angry an’ turn’t dis boy out.

Daddy,' she says, 'I've got a knowledge to dat boy.'

You may say deah wuz all kinds of kings' sons comin’ up showin’ deir
parcels; an’ arter a time or two dis boy comed up agin dressed a bit
better.

An’ de ole king says, 'I see you've got an eye on dis boy. An’ ef it is
to be him, it has to be him.'

All de oder genlemen wuz fit to kill him, an’ dey says, 'Pooh! pooh!
tu’n dat boy out; it can't be him.'

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

But de ole king says, 'Now, my boy, let's see what you got.'

Well, he showed the dimant ring, with her name into it, an’ de fiery
dragin's tongue. *Dordi!* how dese genlemen were mesmerised when he
showed his ’thority, and de king tole him, 'You shall have my destate,
an’ marry my darter.'

An’ he got married to dis heah gal, an’ got all de ole king's destate.
An’ den de stepfather came an’ wanted to own him, but de young king
didn't know such a man.

<span class="small">A bull-calf helps twins in a Russian story
summarised by Ralston, p.134; the squeezing of the cheese crud can be
matched from the Slovak-Gypsy story of 'The Gypsy and the Dragon' ([No.
22](gft082.htm#an_22), [p. 84](gft082.htm#page_84.md); *cf*. also Hahn, i.
152 and ii. 211). For the slaying of a dragon with the aid of helpful
animals, and so rescuing a princess, and for the recognition of the
rescuer by means of the dragon's tongues, *cf*. Grimm's No. 60, 'The Two
Brothers' (i. 244-264 and 418-422). That story must be known to the
Gypsies of Hungary, for we get a rude version of it in the latter half
of Dr. Friedrich Müller's No. 5, whose first half we have summarised on
[p. 34](gft069.htm#page_34.md). The hero here comes to a city deprived of
its water by twelve dragons, who are also going to devour the king's
daughter. He undertakes to rescue her, but falls asleep with his head on
her knees. The twelve white dragons roar beneath the earth, and then
emerge one by one from the fountain, but are torn in pieces by the
hero's twelve wild animals, whose lives he has spared when hunting.
Thereupon the water becomes plentiful, and the hero marries the
princess. Her former lover, however, poisons him. The twelve animals
find his grave, and dig him up. They go in quest of the healing herb;
and the hare, 'whose eyes are always open,' sees a snake with that herb
in its mouth, robs it thereof, and is running away, but at the snake's
request gives back a bit. They then resuscitate their master, who sends
a challenge to the lover by the lion. The marriage is just about to come
off, but the princess reads, weeps, and breaks off the match. In comes
the hero, and having packed off the lover, remarries her. 'If they are
not dead, they are still alive.' *Cf*. our [No. 30](gft090.htm#an_30.md),
'The Rich and the Poor Brother,' pp.
[112](gft089.htm#page_112)-[117](gft091.htm#page_117.md), for stopping the
water <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119); [No. 29](gft089.htm#an_29.md),
' Pretty-face,' [p. 111](gft089.htm#page_111.md), for the snake-leaf; and
[No. 42](gft102.htm#an_42), 'The Dragon,' [p. 143](gft101.htm#page_143.md).
None of these stories, however, offers more than analogues to 'De Little
Bull-calf,' whose humour as to the dragon's tongue is peculiarly its
own. The tongue as the test of who killed the demon occurs in 'Kara and
Guja' (A. Campbell's *Santal Folk-tales*, 1891, pp. 20-21).</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_115"></span>[205:1](gft113.htm#fr_115.md) *Poverty*= poor,
possibly confused with *paltry*, is very common among English Gypsies.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[205:3](gft113.htm#fr_117.md) *Cf*. Noah Young's
name for elder, *mi-duvel's kandlo ruk* ('God's stinking tree'); some
other Gypsies, including Isaac Herren, call it *wuzén*. Oliver Lee's
name for ivy is *ckirikléskro ruk* ('bird's tree'), because it was the
tree brought back by the dove into the ark, and this is the reason that
birds are fond of clustering round it. Holly is *mi-duveléskro ruk*
('God's tree'; *cf*. Cornish *Aunt Mary's Tree*); and Gypsies pitching
their tent against a holly-bush are under divine protection.--J. S.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[206:1](gft113.htm#fr_118.md) 'As cunning as a
bushel o’ monkeys' is a favourite figure of a Gypsy friend of mine.
