*Gypsy Folk Tales*, by Francis Hindes Groome, \[1899\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Campbell of Islay

In the *Saturday Review* for 22nd August 1856 was an article by, I
fancy, Grenville Murray, the 'Roving Englishman,' on Alexandri's
*Ballades et Chants Populaires de la Roumanie*, where allusion is made
to 'the long-haired Gypsies who wander about in their snowy tunics and
bright sashes, the ῥαψῷδοι of Moldo-Wallachia, as in Russia their
brethren are the popular musicians.' But our earliest account of actual
Gypsy folk-tales occurs in vol. iv. p. 431 of *Popular Tales of the West
Highlands*, by J. F. Campbell of Islay (4 vols. Edinburgh, 1860-62).
That eminent collector 'picked up two gipsy tinkers in London--William
and Soloman Johns. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) They came to the
office after hours, and were treated to beer and tobacco. Present, the
author of *Norse Tales* \[Sir George Dasent\]. They were rather hard to
start, but, when once set agoing, they were fluent. One brother was very
proud of the other, who plays the fiddle by ear, and is commonly sent
for to wakes, where he entertains the company with stories. He gave us:
(1) A ghost, which appeared to himself. Finding that he was on the wrong
track, told him a popular tale which I had got from another tinker in
London, "The Cutler and Tinker." Got (2) "The Lad and the Dancing Pigs."
This is the same as the "Mouse and Bee," and has something of "Hacon
Grizzlebeard." A version of it was told to me by Donald MacPhie in South
Uist. It is one of the few indecent stories which I have heard in the
Highlands. There are adventures with a horse, a lion, and a fox, which
the London tinker had not got. It savours of the wit which is to be
found in Straparola. (No. 3) A sailor and others by the help of a magic
blackthorn stick, go to three underground castles

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

of copper, silver, and gold, and win three princesses. Same as "The King
of Lochlin's Daughters" \[i. 236\] and "The Knight of Grianaig" \[iii.
1\], and several stories in *Norse Tales* and Grimm. (No. 4) "The Five
Hunchbacks." This story was quite new to both of us, but a version of it
was subsequently found in a book of Cruikshank's. The tinker's version
was much better. (No. 5) A long and very well told story of a Jew, in
which there figured a magic strap, hat, etc. Same as "Big and Little
Peter," "Eoghan Tuarach" \[ii. 235\], a story in Straparola, etc.
\[*cf*. my [No. 68](gft128.htm#an_68)\]. (No. 6.md) "The Art of
Doctoring"--dirty wit. (No. 7) Poor student and black man travel, dig up
dead woman, make fire in church, steal sheep, clerk and parson take
black man for fiend and bolt. Very well told. See "Goosey Grizzle" and
several Gaelic versions. (No. 8) Poor student, parson, and man with cat,
which was the fiend in disguise. Well told; new to both of us. The men
said that they knew a great many more; that they could neither read nor
write; that they picked these up at wakes and other meetings, where such
tales are commonly told in England now.'

I hoped that the Campbell MSS. in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh,
might yield some further notes on these eight folk-tales; but a search,
instituted in 1888 through the kindness of Mr. Clark, the librarian,
proved ineffectual. Of all unlikely places in the world for a
professional story-teller, London seems the unlikeliest; the heroine, it
may be remembered, of Mr. Hardy's *Hand of Ethelberta* prides herself on
the absolute novelty of the notion. What is almost more surprising is
that two folklorists like Campbell and Dasent should have struck so
precious a vein, and not followed it up. Whatever the source of these
stories, Gypsy, Irish, or English, they were distinctly valuable, and
their value was enhanced by the meagreness forty years ago of the
folk-tales collected in England. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) But
it is quite possible that one or other of the two brothers may still be
living (he need not be seventy). At least any folklorist could probably
find this out at the Potteries, Notting Hill, on Mitcham Common, or in
some other of the Gypsyries in or round London.

Again in vol. i. p. xlvii., Campbell tells how in February 1860 he

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

met two tinkers in St James's Street, with black faces and a pan of
burning coals each. They were followed by a wife, and preceded by a
mangy terrier with a stiff tail. I joined the party, and one told me a
version of "The Man who travelled to learn what Shivering meant," while
we walked together through the park to Westminster. It was clearly the
popular tale which exists in Norse, and German, and Gaelic, and it bore
the stamp of the class, and of the man, who told it in his own peculiar
dialect, and who dressed the actors in his own ideas. A cutler and a
tinker travel together, and sleep in an empty house for a reward. They
are beset by ghosts and spirits of murdered ladies and gentlemen; and
the inferior, the tinker, shows most courage, and is the hero. "He went
into the cellar to draw beer, and there he found a little chap a-sittin’
on a barrel with a red cap on ’is ’ed; and sez he, sez he, 'Buzz.'
'Wot's buzz?' sez the tinker. 'Never you mind wot's buzz,' sez he.
'That's mine; don't you go for to touch it,'" etc. etc. etc.' \[*Cf*. my
[No. 57](gft117.htm#an_57), 'Ashypelt,' and [No. 74](gft134.htm#an_74.md),
The Tale of the Soldier.' <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)\] In vol.
ii. p. 285, Campbell adds that he was never able again to find this
London tinker, who 'could not read the card which I gave him, with a
promise of payment if he would come and repeat his stock of stories. His
female companion, indeed, could both read the card and speak French. The
whole lot seemed to suspect some evil design on my part; and I have
never seen the one who told the story or the woman since, though I met
their comrade afterwards.'

In enumerating the sources of his Gaelic stories (i. p. xxiv.), Campbell
gives (*a*) a West Country fisherman; (*b*) an old dame of seventy;
(*c*) a pretty lass; or (*d*) 'it is an old wandering vagabond of a
tinker who has no roof but the tattered covering of his tent. . . .
There he lies, an old man past eighty, who has been a soldier, and "has
never seen a school"; too proud to beg, too old to work; surrounded by
boxes and horn spoons; with shaggy hair and naked feet, as perfect a
nomad as the wildest Lapp or Arab in the whole world.' etc. Campbell
gives four stories of tinker origin, our Nos. 73-76. To them and to
their tellers I shall revert in my Introduction.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[xlv:1](gft029.htm#fr_16.md) Query, Solomon Jones?
Jones I know for a real Gypsy surname.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[xlvi:1](gft029.htm#fr_17.md) I take some little
pride in having myself been a means of preserving two of our best--I had
almost said, our only two really good--English folk-tales. These are
'Cap o’ Rushes' and 'Tom Tit Tot,' which were told by an old Suffolk
servant to Miss Lois Fison when a child, and which she communicated to
Nos. 23 and 43 of a series of 'Suffolk Notes and Queries,' edited by me
for the Ipswich journal in 1876-77. Thence my friend, Mr. Clodd,
unearthed them a dozen years afterwards; and on the latter he has just
issued a masterly monograph.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[xlvii:1](gft029.htm#fr_18.md) The London tinker's
story, however, seems more closely to resemble 'The Claricaune' in
Crofton Croker's *Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland*
(ed. by Thos. Wright, N.D. pp. 98-112).
