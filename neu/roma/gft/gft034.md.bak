### Wlislocki.

*Märchen and Sagen der Transilvanischen Zigeuner* (Berlin, 1886, 157
pages), by Dr. Heinrich von Wlislocki, differs from all other
Continental collections of Rómani folk-tales in this, that its
sixty-three stories are published for their intrinsic interest, not
solely as linguistic curiosities. They are

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

given in German only, not in the original. Hence they are open to a
suspicion of having been here and there touched up, a suspicion somewhat
confirmed in the rare cases where the original is appended in a
footnote, as on [p. 88](gft083.htm#page_88.md). They are interesting, but
only as a 'restored' building may be interesting; one doubts, one can
never feel quite sure of anything. At the same time, I believe that such
'improvements' apply solely to the language, not to the subject-matter,
of these stories. Their general genuineness is attested by their
occasional lacunæ, as in 'Godfather Death,' which is closely identical
with Grimm's No. 44, but lacks the entire episode of the sick princess.
Besides, except that his work is dedicated to Liebrecht, Dr. von
Wlislocki gives no indication of acquaintance with the subject of
folk-tales, whilst he has approved himself a master of Rómani by his
*Grammar of the Dialect of the Transylvanian Gypsies* (Leipzig, 1884).
He tells us in the preface to his *Märchen* that for several months of
the summer of 1883 he wandered with a band of tented Gypsies through
Transylvania and south-east Hungary, and that during his wanderings he
collected these sixty-three stories, every one of which he was careful
to verify from the lips of a second member of the race. His little work
is easily accessible to every folklorist, so to the folklorists I leave
the task of analysing its stories in detail, premising merely that, like
their predecessors, they offer numerous analogies to non-Gypsy
folk-tales, but that fourteen of them bear a distinctively Gypsy
character, especially Nos. [15](gft075.htm#an_15.md),
[24](gft084.htm#an_24), [31](gft091.htm#an_31), [36](gft096.htm#an_36.md),
[51](gft111.htm#an_51), [55](gft115.htm#an_55.md). Haltrich also gives some
Transylvanian-Gypsy stories (*Zur Volkskunde der siebenbürgischen
Sachsen*, Vienna, 1885); and Vladislav Kornel, Ritter von Zielinski,
contributed four Hungarian-Gypsy ones to the *Gypsy Lore Journal* for
April 1890, pp. 65-73.
