### Transportation.

Banishment and transportation have been important factors in the
dispersion of the Gypsies. They were banished from Germany in 1497,
Spain in 1499, France in 1504, England in 1531, Denmark in 1536, Moravia
in 1538, Scotland in 1541, Poland in 1557, Venetia in 1549, 1558, and
1588, etc.; to such banishment is probably due the fact that in 1564 we
find in the Netherlands a Gypsy woman, Katarine Mosroesse, who had been
born in Scotland. Besides the transportation, already noticed, of
Scottish Gypsies to Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Virginia, of Portuguese
Gypsies to Africa and Brazil, of Basque Gypsies to Africa, and of
English Gypsies to Botany Bay, we know that some time prior to 1800
Gitanos were transported from Spain to Louisiana; whilst in 1544 we find
one large band of Egyptians being sentenced at Huntingdon to be taken to
Calais, the nearest English port on the Continent, and another being
shipped at Boston in Lincolnshire and landed somewhere in Norway.
