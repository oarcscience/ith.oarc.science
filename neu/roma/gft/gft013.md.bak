### In Crete.

From the preceding it may be safely deduced that, with our present
knowledge, or rather lack of knowledge, we can seldom, if ever, fix the
precise date when the Gypsies first set foot in any country. Till 1849
it was almost universally accepted that 1417, the year of their
appearance at the Hanse cities of the Baltic, was also the date of their
first arrival in Europe. But since then Bataillard, Hopf, and Miklosich
have collected a number of passages which prove incontestably that long
before then there must have been Gypsies in south-eastern Europe. Symon
Simeonis, a Minorite friar, who made pilgrimage from

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ireland to the
Holy Land, tells in his *Itinerarium* (Camb. 1778, p, 17), how in 1322
near Candia in Crete: 'There also we saw a race outside the city,
following the Greeks' rite, and asserting themselves to be of the family
of Chaym \[Ham\]. They rarely or never stop in one place beyond thirty
days, but always wandering and fugitive, as though accursed by God,
after the thirtieth day remove from field to field with their oblong
tents, black and low, like the Arabs', and from cave to cave. For after
that period any place in which they have dwelt becomes full of worms and
other nastinesses, with which it is impossible to dwell.' <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xix:1](gft013.htm#fr_3.md) This passage was cited
as far back as 1785 by Jacob Bryant in *Archæologia*, vii. 393; but
another on p. 57 of the *Itinerarium* has hitherto escaped
Gypsiologists. I give it in the original Latin:--'Item sciendum est,
quod in sæpedictis civitatibus \[Alexandria and Cairo\] de omni secta
alia ab illorum viri mulieres lactantes juvenes et cani pravæ venditioni
exponuntur ad instar bestiarum; et signanter indiani schismatici et
danubiani, qui omnes utriusque sexus in colore cum corvis et carbonibus
multum participant; quia hii cum arabis et danubianis semper guerram
continuant, atque cum capiuntur redemptione vel venditione evadunt. . .
. Prædicti autem Danubiani, quamvis ab Indianis non sunt figura et
colore distincti, tamen ab eis distinguuntur per cicatrices longas quas
habent in facie et cognoscuntur; comburunt enim sibi cum ferro ignito
facies illas vilissimas terribiliter in longum, credentes se sic flamine
\[?flammis\] baptizari ut dicitur, et a peccatorum sordibus igne
purgari. Qui postquam ad legem Machometi fuerunt conversi christianis
deteriores sunt Saracenis, sicut et sunt Radiani renegati, et plures
molestias inferunt. . . . Item sciendum, quod in præfatis civitatibus
tanta est eorum multitudo, quod nequaquam numerari possunt.' There is
much in this passage that remains obscure; but it seems clear from it
that in 1322 there were in Egypt large numbers of captives, male and
female, old and young, from the Danubian territories. They were black as
crows and coal, and in complexion and features differed little from
Indians, except that their faces bore long scars produced by burning (?a
kind of tattooing, like that of the Gypsy women in 1427 at Paris on [p.
xii](gft005.htm#page_xii)..md). On conversion to Mohammedanism these
Danubians were worse to the Christians than the Saracens. Were these
Danubians, or some at least of them, Gypsies, prisoners of war, from the
Danubian territories? and did some of them buy back their freedom and
return to Europe? If so, perhaps one has here an explanation of the
hitherto unexplained names 'Egyptian,' 'Gypsy,' 'Gitano,' etc., and of
the story told by the western immigrants of 1417-34 of renegacy from the
Christian faith.
