### Other Parallels.

Resemblances only less strongly marked are observable between Campbell's
two stories of 'The Shifty Lad' and 'The Three Widows' and the
Welsh-Gypsy story of 'Jack the Robber' (No. 68), between his ' Tale of
the Soldier' (given here as a tinker story, [No. 74](gft134.htm#an_74)),
and my 'Ashypelt' ([No. 57](gft117.htm#an_57)), and between his 'Brown
Bear of the Green Glen' ([No. 73](gft133.htm#an_73) here) and my 'Old
King his Three Sons' ([No. 55](gft115.htm#an_55)). There is also
sometimes a striking similarity of phrase and idea in Gaelic and
Welsh-Gypsy stories. Thus, in Campbell we get: 'The dun steed would
catch the swift March wind that would be before, and the swift March
wind could not catch her'; 'He went much further than I can tell or you
can think'; and 'Whether dost thou like the big half of the bannock and
my curse, or the little half and my blessing?' For which John Roberts
gives: 'Off he went as fast as the wind, which the wind behind could not
catch the wind before'; 'Now poor Jack goes . . . further than I can
tell you to-night or ever intend to tell you'; and 'Which would you like
best for me to make you--a little cake and to bless you, or a big cake
and to curse you?' This last feature--of the big cake and curse, or the
little cake and blessing--is found, to the best of my knowledge, in no
folk-tale outside the British Isles; but it occurs also in the
Aberdeenshire story of 'The Red Etin' (Chambers's *Popular Rhymes of
Scotland*, p. 90), and in Kennedy's
