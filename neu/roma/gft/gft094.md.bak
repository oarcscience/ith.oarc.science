### No. 34.--Made over to the Devil

There was a rich man, and he went into the forest, and fell into a bog
with his carriage. And his wife brought forth a

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

son, and he knew it not. And the Devil came forth, and said, 'What will
you give me if I pull you out?'

I will give you what you want.'

'Give me what you have at home.'

'I have horses, oxen.'

'Give me that which you have not seen.'

'I will.'

'Make a covenant with me.'

He made a covenant with him, and the Devil pulled him out of the mud,
and the man went home. By the time he got home he had forgotten the
covenant.

The boy was twenty years old. 'Make me a cake, mother, for I'm off to
the place my father pledged me to.' And he went far over the mountains,
and came to the Devil's house. There was an old woman in the house, and
a daughter of the Devil's, and she asked him, 'Whither art going, lad?'

'I have come to the lord here, to serve.'

And the girl saw him, and he pleased her. 'I may tell you that he is my
father. My father will turn himself into a horse, and will tell you to
mount him and traverse the world. And do you make yourself an iron club
and an iron curry-comb, and hit him with the club, for he will not
stoop, and get on his back, and as you go keep hitting him on the head.'

He traversed the world, and came home, put him in the stable, and went
to the maiden.

'My father didn't fling you?'

'No, for I kept hitting him on the head.'

The Devil called him, and took a jar of poppy-seed, and poured it out on
the grass, and told him to gather it all up, and fill the jar, for, 'If
you don't, I will cut off your head.'

He went to the maiden, and wept.

'What are you weeping for?'

'Your father has told me to fill the jar with poppy-seed; and if I
don't, he will cut off my head.'

She said, 'Fear not.' She went outside and gave a whistle, and the mice
came as many as all the blades of grass and the leaves.

And they asked, 'What do you want, mistress?'

'Gather the poppy-seed and fill the jar.'

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

And the mice came and picked up the grains of poppy-seed one by one, and
filled the jar.

The Devil saw it. 'You're a clever chap. Here is one more task for you:
drain the marsh, and plough it, and sow it, and to-morrow bring me
roasted maize. And if you do not, I shall cut your head off.'

He went to the maiden and wept. 'Your father has told me to drain the
marsh, and give him roasted maize to-morrow.'

'Fear not.'

She went outside, and took the fiery whip. And she struck the marsh
once, and it was dried up; a second time she struck, and it was
ploughed; the third time she struck, it was sowed; the fourth time she
struck, and the maize was roasted; and in the morning he gave him
roasted maize.

She said to him, 'We are three maidens. He will make us all alike, will
call you to guess which is the eldest, which is the middle one, and
which the youngest; and you will not be able to guess, for we shall be
all just alike. I shall be at the top, and notice my feet, for I shall
keep tapping one foot on the other; the middle one will be in the
middle, and the eldest fronting you, and so you will know.'

The Devil said to him, 'One more task I will give you. Fell the whole
forest, and stack it by to-morrow.'

He went to the maiden, and the maiden asked him, 'Have you a father and
mother?'

'I have.'

'Ah! let us fly, for my father will kill you. Take the whetstone, and
take a comb; I have a towel.'

They set out and fled. The Devil arose, saw that the forest is not
felled. ' Go and call him to me.'

Ho, ho! there is neither the lad nor the maiden.

'Hah! go after them.'

They went, and the two saw them coming after them. And she said to him,
'I will make myself a field of wheat, and do you make yourself to be
looking at the wheat, and they will ask you, "Didn't a maiden and a lad
pass by?" "Bah! they passed when I was sowing the wheat."'

'Go back, for we shall not catch them.'

They went back. 'We did not catch them.'

'On the road did not you find anything?'

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

'We found a field of wheat and a peasant.'

'Go back, for the field of wheat was she, and he was the peasant.'

They saw them again. She said to the lad, 'I will turn a somersault and
make myself an old church, and do you turn a somersault and make
yourself an old monk, and they will ask you, "Didn't a maiden and a lad
pass by?" "They passed just as I began the church."'

'Ah! go back, for we shall never catch them. When he was beginning the
church! It is old now.'

'Did you not find anything on the road?'

'We found a church and a monk.'

'The church was she, and he was the monk. I will go myself.'

They saw him. 'Now my father is coming; we shall not escape. Fling the
comb.'

He flung the comb, and it became a forest from earth to sky. Whilst he
was gnawing away the forest, they got a long way ahead. He was catching
them up; she cried, Fling the whetstone.'

He flung the whetstone, and it became a rock of stone from earth even to
heaven. Whilst he, the Devil, was making a hole in the rock, they got a
long way ahead. Again he is catching them up. 'Father is catching us
up.' She flung the towel, and it became a great water and a mill. They
halted on the bank.

And he cried, 'Harlot, how did you cross the water?'

'Fasten the millstone to your neck, and jump into the water.'

He fastened the millstone to his neck, and jumped into the water, and
was choked.

She said, 'Fear not, for my father is choked.'

He went to his father with the maiden. His father rejoiced; but the
maiden said to the lad, 'I will go to expiate my father's sins, for I
choked him. I go for three years.'

She took her ring, and broke it in half, and gave one half to him. 'Keep
that, and do not lose it.' She departed for three years.

He forgot her, and made preparations to marry. He was holding his
wedding. She came, and he knew her not.

'Drink a glass of brandy.'

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

She drank out of his glass, and flung the half of the ring into the
glass, and gave it to him. When he drank, he got it into his mouth, and
he took it in his hand and looked at it, and he took his half and fitted
the two together. 'Hah! this is my wife; this one saved me from death.'

And he quashed that marriage, and took his first wife and lived with
her.

<span class="small">There are several obvious lacunæ in this story, one
that the poppy-seed must have been mixed with some other seed, else the
task would have been far too easy. The Polish-Gypsy story of 'The Witch'
([No. 50](gft110.htm#an_50).md), corresponds pretty closely; and for the
roasted maize task compare the Roumanian-Gypsy story of The Snake who
became the King's Son-in-law' ([No. 7](gft067.htm#an_07).md). For a
multitude of non-Gypsy variants see Ralston's The Water-King and
Vasilissa the Wise' (pp. 120-133), especially the Indian story at the
end. *Cf*. also Cosquin, ii. 9, and i. 103, 106, 139, 141. The ring
episode recurs in the Bohemian-Gypsy story, The Three Dragons' ([No.
44](gft104.htm#an_44), [p. 154](gft104.htm#page_154).md). The fiery whip in
the Gypsy story is, to the best of my knowledge, unique.</span>
