### Gypsy Migrations.

In the *Academy* for 11th June 1887 Mr. Lang objected: 'Can M. Cosquin
show that South Siberia and Zanzibar got their contes by oral
transmission from India within the historical period? This is doubtful;
but it seems still more unlikely that tales which originated in India
could have reached Barra and Uist in the Hebrides, and Zululand, and the
Samoyeds--not to mention America--by oral transmission, and all within
the historical period.' My pp. [xv](gft008.htm#page_xv.md).--xviii. and
[xxxv](gft022.htm#page_xxxv.md).--xlv. furnish a fairly good answer to much
of this objection, for they show that during the last three centuries
recent immigrants from India, possessed of folk-tales, have been passing
to and fro between Lorraine and Italy, Scotland and North America,
Portugal and Africa and Brazil, Poland and Siberia, Spain and Louisiana,
the Basque Country and Africa, Hungary and Italy, Germany, Belgium,
France, Spain, and Algeria, the Balkan Peninsula and Scandinavia, Italy
and Asia Minor, Corfu and Corsica, the Levant and Liverpool, Hungary and
Scotland. But, indeed, Mr. Lang's objection was, in part at least,
answered already, by the discovery in Scandinavia, Orkney, and
Lancashire of thousands of Cufic coins of the ninth and tenth centuries.
For where coins could journey from Bagdad, so also of course could
folk-tales.

I remember once in an English parsonage being shown a 'cannibal fork.' I
do not think I rushed to the conclusion that the parson's grandmother
had been a ghoul; no, I rather fancy there was talk of

<span id="page_lxxv">p. lxxv</span>

a son or a brother who was a missionary somewhere, perhaps in the South
Sea Islands. And I remember also how a Suffolk vicar unearthed a
Romano-British cemetery. One of his most treasured finds was a pair of
brass compasses: 'Marvellous,' he would point out, 'how like they are to
our own.' 'As well they may be,' old Mrs. C------ remarked to me (she
was the daughter of a former vicar), for I can quite well remember my
poor brother John losing them.'
