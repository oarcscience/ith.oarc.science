### Gypsies as Nomads.

No; language, like history, has yielded important results, but on many
points we still have almost everything to learn. We do not know within a
thousand years when the Gypsies left India, or when they arrived in
Persia, Armenia, Africa, Asia Minor, and South-eastern Europe. But we do
know that India was their original home, that they must have sojourned
long in a Greek-speaking region, and that in western and northern Europe
their present dispersion dates mainly if not entirely from after the
year 1417. These three facts will have to be borne in mind for
understanding what follows; a fourth fact is that a portion, if a small
portion, of the Gypsy race is still intensely nomadic. Nothing is
commoner than for the English Gypsies of our novels and plays to speak
familiarly of 'sunny Spain'; those of a little anonymous story, *The
Gipsies* (1842), go backwards and forwards to Norway. But as a rule
English Gypsies never stir out of Great Britain, or, if they do leave
it, leave it only for another English-speaking country--Canada, the
United States, or New Zealand. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12) So
far, too, as we know, our present Gypsies are all descendants of early
Gypsy immigrants; their surnames--Lee, Faa, Baillie, Stanley, Gray,
Smith, Heron, Boswell, etc.--date back to the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. And our sole hint, until a quite recent date, as to visits to
England by Continental Gypsies is a Bartholomew Fair handbill of 1689
about some German Gypsies, rope-dancers.

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Mutatis
mutandis*, the same seems to hold good of the Gypsies of Germany,
Poland, Norway, etc.; they are apparently the descendants of early
immigrants into those different countries.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[xxxv:1](gft023.htm#fr_12) In *Chronicles of a
Virgin Fortress* (1896), Mr. W. V. Herbert gives an extraordinary story
of one of the Stanleys, who, forced to fly Hampshire for some offence,
found his way to Bulgaria, and as 'Istanli' became a Gypsy chieftain and
public executioner of Widdin about 1874. Tom Taylor's returned 'lag' of
p. xvii recurs also to memory, and John Lee, the Gypsy recruit of 'John
Company,' from whom on the outward voyage in 1805 Lieut. Francis Irvine
of the Bengal Native Infantry took down a Rómani vocabulary of 138 words
(*Trans. Lit. Soc.* Bombay, 1819).
