### Indian Parallels.

I raise these objections myself, knowing that, if I did not, someone
else would certainly do so, with the gleeful remark, 'Down goes the
silly theory of the dispersion of folk-tales by Gypsies.' By no means,
necessarily. The theory

<span id="page_lxix">p. lxix</span>

may be inapplicable in these and in other cases; but what will the
folklorists make of another Polish-Gypsy story, the 'Tale of a Foolish
Brother and of a Wonderful Bush' ([No. 45](gft105.htm#an_45))? Of it we
find a variant in the Welsh-Gypsy story of 'The Dragon' ([No.
61](gft121.htm#an_61)), and a most unmistakable version in the Indian
fairy-tale of 'The Monkey Prince' (Maive Stokes, No. 10, p. 41). The
connection, indeed, between the Gypsy and the Indian folk-tale seems
scarcely less obvious than that between *páni*, water, in Rómani, and
*páni*, water, in Hindustani. This, I think, must be granted; but what,
then, of the non-Gypsy versions, cited on [p. 161](gft105.htm#page_161),
from Russia, Norway, and Sicily? Or take the Turkish-Gypsy story of
'Baldpate' ([No. 2](gft062.htm#an_02)). It is identical, on the one
hand, with Grimm's 'Faithful John' (No. 6) and many more European
versions, and, on the other hand, with the latter half of 'Phakir Chand'
(Lal Behari Day's *Folk-tales of Bengal*, pp. 39-52). Is it not possibly
the link between them? And may not similar links be discernible in these
eight parallels, where the notes on the Gypsy tales will supply the
exact references:--

There is also a frequent identity of incident in Gypsy and Indian
folk-tales. Thus, in the Hungarian-Gypsy version of 'The Vampire' ([No.
5](gft065.htm#an_05)), the king sends his coachman to pluck the flower
that has grown from the maiden's grave; the coachman cannot, but the
king himself can, and takes the flower home. Just so the Bel-Princess,
thrown into a well, turns into a lotus-flower, which recedes from the
villager who tries to pluck it, but floats into the prince's hand

<span id="page_lxx">p. lxx</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Maive Stokes's
*Indian Fairy Tales*, p. 145; also p. 10). Fruits causing pregnancy are
common in Gypsy as in Indian folk-tales (*cf*. Notes to [No.
16](gft076.htm#an_16)); and God sends St. Peter with them in the former
just as Mahádeo does an old fakír in the latter. The sleeping beauty in
'The Winged Hero' ([No. 26](gft086.htm#an_26)) lies lifeless on the bed,
and is awakened only by the removal of the candle from her head; in 'The
Boy with the Moon on his Forehead' (Lal Behari Day's *Folk-tales of
Bengal*, p. 251) it is two little sticks of gold and silver that revive
the suspended animation of the young lady sleeping on the golden
bedstead. The rescue of the eaglets from the dragon in 'Mare's Son'
([No. 20](gft080.htm#an_20)) exactly matches the rescue of the two birds
from the huge serpent in the Bengal 'Story of Prince Sobur' (p. 134);
and the princess in the tree in that same Bengal story (p. 126) comes
very near the wife in the oak in the Polish-Gypsy 'Tale of a Girl who
was sold to the Devil' ([No. 46](gft106.htm#an_46)). The robbers in a
Moravian-Gypsy story ([No. 43](gft103.htm#an_43)) break through the wall
of a castle like the robbers of Scripture and of Indian folk-tales; and
one very curious feature, which we can trace across two continents, is
the feather, hair, or wing of a bird, beast, or insect, the burning of
which, or sometimes the mere thinking on which, summons its former
possessor to the hero's aid. It occurs in this passage from an
unpublished Turkish-Gypsy story (Paspati, p. 523):--'He gave the old man
a feather, and he said to the old man, "Take it and carry it to your
daughter, and if she puts it in the fire I will come."' It occurs, too,
in the Roumanian-Gypsy story of The Three Princesses and the Unclean
Spirit' ([No. 10](gft070.htm#an_10)), in the Bukowina-Gypsy story of
'The Enchanted City' ([No. 32](gft092.htm#an_32)), and in the
Polish-Gypsy 'Tale of a Girl who was sold to the Devil' ([No.
46](gft106.htm#an_46)). It is by no means a common feature in Western
folk-lore, but it occurs in Basile's *Pentamerone*, iv. 3, and in the
Irish story of 'The Weaver's Son and the Giant of the White Hill'
(Curtin, pp. 64-77) the hero gets a bit of wool from the ram, a bit of
fin from the salmon, and a feather from the eagle, with injunctions to
take them out when in any difficulty, and so summon all the rams,
salmon, or eagles of the world to his assistance. As I show in the notes
to [No. 46](gft106.htm#an_46), the idea is of frequent occurrence in the
folk-tales of the Levant <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27) and of
India. In Mrs. Steel's *Wide-awake Stories*, p. 32, the demon says to
the Faithful Prince, 'Take this hair with you, and, when you need help,
burn it,

<span id="page_lxxi">p. lxxi</span>

then I will come immediately to your assistance.' And in the *Arabian
Nights* ('Conclusion of the Story of the Ladies of Baghdad') the
Jinneeyeh gives the first lady a lock of her hair, and says, When thou
desirest my presence, burn a few of these hairs, and I will be with thee
quickly, though I should be beyond Mount Kaf.'

The list, I expect, of identical plots and incidents could be largely
extended even from my collection by M. Cosquin or any one else well
versed in Indian folklore. Yet, as it stands, that list goes some way to
corroborate my theory. One obvious objection may be anticipated. A
folk-tale, as told to-day in India, need not be more primitive, more
faithful to the original, than the same folk-tale as told to-day in
Greece or Germany. The same wear and tear may have affected the story
that stayed at home as has affected the story that wandered westward a
thousand or two thousand years ago; it may have affected it in a very
much greater degree. That is just what we find in language; the Rómani
*vast*, hand, comes much nearer the Sanskrit *hasta* than does the
Hindustani *hāth*. Another point may also be illustrated from language.
The same word, or two kindred words, may have reached the same
destination by different routes and at widely different periods. The
Gypsies brought with them *páni*, water, to England, whither centuries
after came the 'brandy-*pawnee*' of Anglo-Indians; *páni* is a far-away
cousin of *ae*, *aqueous*, *aquarium*, etc. *Brother* and
*fraternal*, <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28) *foot* and
*pedestrian*, are two out of hundreds of similar instances. In much the
same way, it need not be any positive objection to the late transmission
of a folk-tale to Norway or England, that an earlier form of that
folk-tale already existed there. Because in the *Nibelungenlied* one
finds a striking parallel to an episode in the Bukowina-Gypsy story of
The Prince, his Comrade, and Nastasa the Fair' ([No.
24](gft084.htm#an_24)), it does not follow that that story is
necessarily derived from the *Nibelungenlied*. Still, the difficulty of
discriminating between the earlier and the more recent forms of a
folk-tale must be enormous--it may be, insuperable.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_27"></span>[lxx:1](gft047.htm#fr_27) Some one will be sure
to point out, if I do not, that most or all of these incidents occur
also in non-Gypsy European folk-tales, and that therefore they are not
peculiar to the Gypsies. Precisely: that is a possible confirmation of
my theory.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[lxxi:1](gft047.htm#fr_28) To which add the
slang *pal*, a comrade, from the Rómani, *pral*, brother.
