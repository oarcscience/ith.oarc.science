### In Corfu.

The Empress Catherine de Courtenay-Valois (1301-46), granted to the
suzerains of Corfu authority to receive as vassals certain '*homines
vageniti*,' coming from the Greek mainland, and using the Greek rite. By
the close of the fourteenth century these *vageniti* were all of them
subject to a single baron, Gianuli de Abitabulo, and formed the nucleus
of a fief called the fief of Abitabulo or *feudum Acinganorum*, which
lasted under various superiors until the abolition of feudal tenures in
the beginning of the present century. One of those superiors,

about 1540, was the learned Antonio Eparco, Melanchthon's correspondent;
another, the tyrannical Count Teodoro Michele, who died in 1787. This
little Gypsy colony, numbering about a hundred adults, besides children,
had a tax to pay twice a year to their superior, as also such fines as
two gold pieces and a couple of fat hens for permission to marry. They
were mechanics, smiths, tinkers, and husbandmen; celebrated a great
yearly festival on the first of May; and were amenable only to the
jurisdiction of their lord. Carl Hopf, in *Die Einwanderung der Zigeuner
in Europa* (Gotha, 1870, pp. 17-23), tells us much about them, collected
from the papers of Count Teodoro Trivoli, who succeeded to the property
in 1863. Still we would fain know much more, especially something as to
their language. One point to be noticed is that Italians must in Corfu
have come early in contact with Gypsies, for the island belonged to
Venice from 1401 to 1797.
