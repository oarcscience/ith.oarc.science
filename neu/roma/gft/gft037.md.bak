*Gypsy Folk Tales*, by Francis Hindes Groome, \[1899\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### John Roberts.

Twenty to thirty years ago I knew hundreds of Gypsies in most parts of
England and Wales. But the Rómani dialect was in those days my
all-in-all; I would walk or ride thirty miles, and feel richly rewarded
if I came back with two or three new words, such as *mormússi*, midwife,
or *taltoráiro*, crow. I knew little or nothing about folklore, and
cared less; the few stray odds and ends of it that I picked up among the
people are scattered mostly through my *In Gypsy Tents* (Edinb. 1880).
At Virginia Water, in 1872, I remember old Matty Cooper telling me how
the plaice went about calling out, 'I'm the King of the Fishes,' which
was why her mouth was made crooked (*cf*. Grimm's No. 172, The Sole');
and from a Boswell in, I think, 1875, I got the lying story of 'Happy
Boz’ll,' which I give here, [No. 36](gft096.htm#an_36.md). But my one great
find was my lighting on the Welsh-Gypsy harper, John Roberts (1815-94),
of Newtown in Montgomeryshire. *In Gypsy Tents* contains a great deal
about him and by him (pp. 78-81, 94-99, 149-158, 197-216, 269-278,
290-294, 299-319, 372-377) here, then, it may suffice to say that,
though not a full-blooded Gypsy, he could speak Rómani, yes, and write
Rómani, as no other Gypsy I have ever met at home or on the Continent. I
know, indeed, of no other instance where the teller of folk-tales has
also been able himself to transcribe them. He wrote out for me the two
long folk-tales reprinted here (Nos. 54 and 55), and he had a wealth of
others: I fear that many of them have perished with him. He was one of
the finest of Welsh harpers; he spoke Welsh, English, and Rómani with
equal fluency; and he was a man besides of rare intelligence. His tales,
he would have it, were all derived from the *Arabian Nights*, 'leastwise
if it was not from my poor old mother, or else from my grandmother, and
she was a wonderful woman for telling stories.'
