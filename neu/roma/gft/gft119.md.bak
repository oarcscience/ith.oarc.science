### No. 59.--The Old Smith <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md)

An old smith lived on a hill with his wife and mother-in-law. He could
only make ploughshares. A boy comes, and wants his horse shod. The smith
could not do it. The boy cuts the horse's legs off, stops the blood, and
puts the legs on the fire, beats them on the anvil, and replaces them on
the horse. He gives the smith a guinea, and goes away. The smith tries
this with his mother-in-law's horse, but bungles it: the horse bleeds to
death, and its legs are burnt to ashes. The boy comes again with two old
women. 'I want you to make them young again.' The smith couldn't. The
boy puts them on the fire, beats them on the anvil, and rejuvenates
them. The smith tries it with his wife and mother-in-law, but burns them
to ashes. He leaves his forge, and sets off in the snow and wind. The
barefooted boy follows him. The smith wants to send him off. The boy
tells him of a sick king in the next town, whom they will cure, the boy
acting as the smith's servant. The butler admits them, and gives them
plenty to eat and drink. The smith forgets all about the sick king, but
the boy reminds him. They go up. The boy asks for a knife, pot, water,
and spoon. He cuts the king's head off, and spits on his hand to stop
the blood. He puts the head in the pot, boils it, lifts it out with the
golden spoon, and replaces it on the king, who is cured. The king gives
them a sack of gold.

They take the road again.

'All I want,' says Barefoot, 'is a pair of shoes.'

'I've little enough for myself,' says the smith.

The boy leaves him, and the smith goes on alone. Hearing of another sick
king, he goes to cure him, but takes too much to drink, and boils his
head all to ribbons, and lets him bleed to death. A knock comes to the
door. The smith, frightened, refuses admittance.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

'Won't you open to little Barefoot?'

The boy enters, and with much difficulty gets the head on again. The
king is cured, and gives them two sacks of gold. The boy asks for shoes
and gets them. The boy tells the smith of a gentleman who has a
wizard, <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md) whom none can beat: 'Let's
go there. Three sacks of gold to any one who beats him.' They enter.
There was a bellows. The wizard blows, and blows up half the sea; the
boy blows up a fish that drinks up all the wizard's water. The wizard
blows up corn as it were rain; the boy blows up birds that eat the corn.
The wizard blows up hundreds of rabbits; the boy blows up greyhounds
that catch the rabbits. So they win the three sacks of gold. The smith
hardly knows what to do with all his money. He builds a village and
three taverns, and spends his time loafing round. An old woman comes and
begs a night's lodging. He gives it her. She gives him three wishes. He
wishes that whoever takes his hammer in his hand can't put it down
again, that whoever sits on his chair can't get up again, and that
whoever gets in his pocket can't get out again. One day, when money had
run low, a man comes to the smith and asks will he sell himself. The
smith sells himself for a bag of gold, the time to be up in five years.
After five years the man returns. The smith gives him his hammer to
hold, and goes off to his tavern. From inn to inn the man follows him,
and, finding him in the third inn, gives him five more years' freedom.
The same thing happens with the chair; and the smith gets five more
years from the old man (now called *Beng*, devil). The third time the
devil finds the smith in one of his taverns. The smith explains that he
has called for drinks, and asks the devil to change himself into a
sovereign in his (the smith's) pocket to pay for them. The devil does
so. The smith returns home, and goes to bed. At night he hears a great
uproar in his trousers pocket, gets up, puts them on the anvil, and
hammers. The devil promises never to meddle with him in future if he
will release him. The

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

smith lets him go. Afterwards the smith dies, and goes to the devil's
door and knocks. An imp of Satan comes out. Tell your father the smith
is here.'

The little devil went and told his father.

'He will kill us all,' said the devil, 'if we let him in. Here, take
this wisp of straw, and light him upstairs to God.'

The little devil did so. The smith went to heaven. There he sat and
played the harp. And there we shall all see him one day unless we go to
the devil instead.

Paul Bataillard got from Catalonian Gypsies encamped near Paris in 1869,
and which very closely resembles one of the *Cento Novelle Antiche*,
summarised by Crane (*Italian Popular Tales*, p. 360).</span>

St. Peter travels with Christ as his servant, and they are often hard
put to it for a livelihood. Christ sends St. Peter to find a sheep, and,
bidding him cook it, goes to heal a sick person, who rewards him richly.
Peter eats the sheep's liver and kidneys, and Christ, when he comes
back, asks where the liver and kidneys are, 'for Jesus, who is God,
knows everything.' Peter replying that the sheep had none, at the end of
their meal Christ divides into three heaps the large sum received from
the farmer whom he has healed. 'For whom are these three heaps?' asks
Peter. 'The two first for each of us,' Christ answers, 'and the third
for him who ate the liver and kidneys.' 'That was me,' says Peter. 'Very
well,' Christ answers, 'take my share as well. I return to my own.' And
then it is that Christ takes the cross, etc. 'You see,' the narrator
ended, 'that it was God Jesus who at the beginning of the world founded
all the estates of men--first doctors, for he healed for money--and who
taught the Gypsies to beg and to go barefoot, whilst St. Peter
instructed them how to deceive their like.'

<span class="small">In another Catalonian-Gypsy story, Christ sends St.
Peter to a farm to get an omelette or some roasted eggs, and Peter
returns with the omelette hidden in his hat, intending to keep it for
himself. Two other pseudo-Christian legends of Christ travelling with
St. Peter were told</span>

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

to M. Bataillard by an Alsatian Gypsy, but he had forgotten them (Letter
of 22nd April 1872). Ralston has a legend (p. 346) of a Gypsy who learns
of God, through St. George, that 'his business is to cheat and to swear
falsely,' so opens business by stealing the saint's golden stirrup.

Lastly Dr. von Sowa gives [this confused but curious Slovak-Gypsy
tale](gft120.htm#an_60.md):--

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_133"></span>[247:1](gft119.htm#fr_133.md) The next eight
Welsh-Gypsy stories were told, like the last, in Rómani, by Matthew Wood
to Mr. Sampson; and the English summaries of them given here are by Mr.
Sampson.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[248:1](gft119.htm#fr_134.md) I am reminded of
Poly Mace, the champion's cousin. He was camping at Golden Acre near
Granton, and told me one Sunday that he knew a sea captain who had a
familiar: would I care to see it? Of course I would; had he seen it?
what was it like, then? 'well, it's a very curious kind of a little,
wee, teeny dragon, that is, Mr. Groome; changes colour, it does,
according to where you puts it.' I found Poly meant a chameleon.
