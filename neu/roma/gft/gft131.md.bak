### No. 71.--Winter

An old man and woman, very poor, live in a cottage. The old man saves up
money in a stocking for winter. A beggar comes to the door. The old
woman asks his name. 'Winter.' 'Here is money, my old man, saved for
you.' The old husband comes home. They leave the cottage, the old woman
taking the door with her (reason not given), and camp out in a tree.
Robbers come and camp underneath, and quarrel over the division of their
spoil. They want change for £1. One says he will have change if he goes
to the devil for it. Down falls the door. The robbers think it is the
devil, and fly, leaving the money. The old man and woman seize it, and
return to their cottage.

<span class="small">Halliwell's *Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales*
(1849), p. 31, has a story of 'The Miser and his Wife,' where the beggar
calls himself 'Good Fortune.' A most unlikely name, whereas Winter, it
is worth remarking, was the name of a Northumbrian Gypsy family
(Simson's *History of the Gypsies*, 1865, p. 96), as also of German
Gypsies. 'The Story of Mr. Vinegar' (Halliwell, p. 26), obtained from
oral tradition in the West of England, tells how a husband and wife go
off, taking the door, climb a tree, let the door fall on thieves, and
get the booty. A very Rabelaisian passage in Price's story, which I have
omitted, explains why Vinegar. That story is identical with Grimm's
'Frederick and Catherine' (No. 59, i. 238-244 and 417-18); for putting
meat among the cabbages, *cf*. Grimm's Diemel variant. In Campbell's
*Santal Folk-tales*, p. 30, Bitaram climbs into a true for safety when
darkness comes on, 'as wild beasts infested the forest through which he
was passing. During the night some thieves came under the tree in which
he was, and began to divide the money they had stolen. Bitaram then
relaxed</span>

<span class="small">his hold of his dry cowhide, which made such a noise
as it fell from branch to branch that the thieves fled terror-stricken,
and left all their booty behind them. In the morning Bitaram descended,
and collecting all the rupees carried them home.' And in F. A. Steel's
*Wide-awake Stories* from the Panjab, p. 242, there is another most
curious parallel, where the robber captain puts out his tongue, and,
snip! the barber's clever wife bites the tip off clean. 'What with the
fright and the pain, he tumbled off the branch and fell bump on the
ground, where he sat with his legs very wide apart, looking as if he had
fallen from the skies. "What is the matter?" cried his comrades,
awakened by the noise of his fall. "Bul-ul-a-bul-ul-ul!" said he, still
pointing upwards. "The man is bewitched," cried one; "there must be a
ghost in the tree."' From India to Wales I know not how many thousands
of miles; neither know I how many centuries since the forebears of the
tellers of these two tales parted company. *Cf*. also Hahn, i.
221.</span>
