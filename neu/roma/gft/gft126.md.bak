### No. 66.--Fairy Bride

A king has three sons, and knows not to which of them to leave his
kingdom. They shoot for it with bow and arrows. The youngest shoots so
far that his arrow is lost. He seeks it for a long time, and at last
finds it sticking in a glass door. He enters and finds himself in the
home of the Queen of the Fairies, whom he marries. After a while he
returns home with his bride. An old witch who lives in the park incites
the king to ask the fairy bride to fetch him a handkerchief which will
cover the whole park. She does it, and then is asked to bring her
brother. She refuses, but finally summons him. He enters, and terrifies
the king by his threatening aspect. 'What did you call me for?' The king
is too frightened to answer coherently. The fairy's brother kills him
and the old witch, and vanishes. They live at the castle.

<span class="small">Arrows occur in the Bukowina-Gypsy story of 'Mare's
Son' ([No. 20](gft080.htm#an_20), [p. 79](gft080.htm#page_79).md). The
handkerchief that will cover all the park reminds one of the tent with
room for the king and all his soldiers in an Arab version of our [No.
17](gft077.htm#an_17), 'It all comes to Light' (Cosquin, i. 196.md).
Otherwise I can offer no parallel for this story.</span>
