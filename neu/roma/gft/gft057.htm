<p>Campbell of Islay has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller in London, and Paspati has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller, the grandson of one at Constantinople. That is not much, perhaps; but there are several more indications of the transmission of folk-tales by Gypsies. <i>Bakht</i>, the R&oacute;mani word for 'luck' or 'fortune,' has passed, not merely into Albanian folk-tales, but into the Greek and Turkish languages, as I show in a footnote on <A HREF="gft072.htm#page_53">p. 53</A>; and a good many of the following seventy-six stories seem to show unmistakable tokens of the practised raconteur's art. 'Let us leave the dogs, and return to the girl,' in <A HREF="gft107.htm#an_47">No. 47</A>; 'Now we'll leave the master to stand a bit, and go back to the mother,' in <A HREF="gft128.htm#an_68">No. 68</A>; 'And I came away, told the story,' in Nos. <A HREF="gft066.htm#an_06">6</A>, <A HREF="gft067.htm#an_07">7</A>, <A HREF="gft068.htm#an_08">8</A>, and <A HREF="gft075.htm#an_15">15</A>; 'And I left them there, and came and told my story to your lordships,' in <A HREF="gft070.htm#an_10">No. 10</A>; 'I was there, and heard everything that happened,' in <A HREF="gft072.htm#an_12">No. 12</A>; 'Away I came, the tale have told,' in <A HREF="gft078.htm#an_18">No. 18</A>; 'Now you've got it,' in <A HREF="gft088.htm#an_28">No. 28</A>; 'If they are not dead, they are still alive,' in Nos. <A HREF="gft101.htm#an_41">41</A> and <A HREF="gft102.htm#an_42">42</A>, and also in Hungarian-Gypsy stories; 'The floor there was made of paper, and I came away here,' in <A HREF="gft103.htm#an_43">No. 43</A>; 'So if they are not dead, they are living together,' in <A HREF="gft104.htm#an_44">No. 44</A>; 'Excuse me for saying it,' in <A HREF="gft115.htm#an_55">No. 55</A>; 'She was delivered (pray, excuse me) of a boy,' in <A HREF="gft106.htm#an_46">No. 46</A>; 'And the last time I was there I played my harp for them, and got to go again,' in <A HREF="gft114.htm#an_54">No. 54</A>--these all sound like tags or formulas of the professional story-teller. L&eacute;on Zafiri's usual wind-up, says Paspati (p. 421), ran: 'And I too, I was there, and I ate, and I drank, and I have come to tell you the story.'</p>
