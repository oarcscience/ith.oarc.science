*Gypsy Folk Tales*, by Francis Hindes Groome, \[1899\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### Gypsy originality.

Sometimes, I scarce know why, the eloquence and the ingenuity of
folklorists suggest these reminiscences; anyhow, I doubt if to

folklorists my theory is likely to commend itself. From solar myths,
savage philosophy, archæan survivals, polyonymy, relics of Druidism,
polygamous frameworks, and such-like high-sounding themes, it is a
terrible come-down to Gypsies = gipsies = tramps. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) So I look for most folklorists to scout my
theory, and to maintain that the Turkish Gypsies picked up their
folk-tales from Turks or Greeks, the Roumanian Gypsies theirs from
Roumans, the Hungarian Gypsies theirs from Magyars, the English and
Welsh Gypsies theirs from the English and Welsh, the ------ Hold! hold!
pray where are the English or Welsh originals of our Gypsy versions of
The Master Thief,' 'The Little Peasant,' Frederick and Catherine,'
'Ferdinand the Faithful,' 'The Master Smith,' 'The Robber Bridegroom,'
or 'Strong Hans'? where those of such English and Welsh Gypsy stories as
The Black Dog of the Wild Forest,' 'De Little Bull-calf,' 'Jack and his
Golden Snuff-box,' or An Old King and his Three Sons in England'? It may
be answered that the last three are in Mr. Joseph Jacobs' *English Fairy
Tales* (2 vols. 1890-94). I know those stories are there; they form
nearly ten per cent. of Mr. Jacobs' entire collection; but have they any
business to be there? I have John Roberts' manuscript of An Old King'
before me now; it opens--'Adoi ses yecker porro koreelish, to ses les
trin chavay.' You may render that, as I rendered it, into English,
'There was once an old king, and he had three sons'; but that does not
make the story an English one. No; so far as our present information
goes, An Old King' is a Welsh-Gypsy folk-tale. <span

<span id="page_lxxvi">p. lxxvi</span>

There is at least one other story in Mr. Jacobs' collection that may be
Gypsy, not English. This is 'The Three Feathers,' which, Mrs. Gomme
tells me, was collected from some Deptford hop-pickers by a lady now in
America. Not all hop-pickers are Gypsies, but a goodly proportion are,
as I know from old walks among Kentish and Surrey hop-gardens. 'The
Three Feathers' is a variant of Laura Gonzenbach's Sicilian story of
'Feledico and Epomata' (No. 55, i. 251), of an incident in Campbell's
Gaelic story of 'The Battle of the Birds' (No. 2, i. 36, 50), of one in
Kennedy's Irish story of 'The Brown Bear of Norway' (p. 63), and of one
in the Norse story of ' The Master-maid.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[lxxv:1](gft053.htm#fr_30.md) That, however, is a
vulgar error; the Gypsies are one of the purest races in Europe.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[lxxv:2](gft053.htm#fr_31.md) I have sometimes
wondered, what if a folklorist, making a little tour in Wales, in a
Welsh inn-garden had come on a venerable Welsh harper, playing ancient
Welsh airs, and speaking Welsh more fluently than English? He would have
drawn him, of course, for folk-tales, and to! a perfect mine of
them--long, unpublished stories, all about magic snuff-boxes and magic
balls of yarn, the kings of the mice and the frogs and the fowls of the
air, griffins of the greenwood, <span id="page_lxxvi">p. lxxvi</span>
golden apples and golden castles, sleeping princesses, and all the rest
of it. 'Eureka!' that folklorist would have shouted, and straightway
meditated a new Welsh *Mabinogion*. Welsh--Celtic--not at all
necessarily; his old Welsh bard might have been just John Roberts the
Gypsy.
