### Unique Features.

An absolutely unique story or incident is a very rare find in folklore.
A few stories in the present collection I have not been able to match,
*e.g.* 'The Three Princesses and the Unclean Spirit' ([No.
10](gft070.htm#an_10).md), 'The Red King and the Witch'
([14](gft074.htm#an_14).md), 'The Prince and the Wizard'
([15](gft075.htm#an_15)), 'Pretty-face' ([29](gft089.htm#an_29).md), 'A
Girl who was sold to the Devil' ([46](gft106.htm#an_46).md), and 'The Black
Dog of the Wild Forest' ([72](gft132.htm#an_72).md). Then as to incidents,
I have met with no non-Gypsy parallel to the somersault that in Gypsy
stories almost invariably precedes a transformation (*cf*. footnote
[2](gft065.htm#fn_43) on [p. 16](gft065.htm#page_16).md). I have met with
none to the striking ordeal in 'Mare's Son' ([No.
20](gft080.htm#an_20).md):--

<span class="small">'He went to his brothers. "Good-day to you,
brothers. You fancied I should perish. If you acted fairly by me, toss
your arrows up in the air, and they will fall before you; but if
unfairly, then they will fall on your heads." All four tossed up their
arrows, and they stood in a row. His fell right before him, and theirs
fell on their heads, and they died.'</span>

'The Seer' ([No. 23](gft083.htm#an_23).md) offers a variant:

<span class="small">'And he said, "Good-day to you, brothers. You
fancied I had perished. You have pronounced your own doom. Come out with
me, and toss your swords up in the air. If you acted fairly by me, it
will fall before you; but if unfairly, it will fall on your head." The
three of them tossed up their swords, and that of the youngest fell
before him, but theirs fell on their head, and they died.'</span>

Then there is the fine conception, of frequent occurrence in Wlislocki's
Transylvanian-Gypsy stories, that the sun in the morning sets forth as a
little child, by noon has grown to a man, and comes home at eventide
weary, old, and grey. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) And this
again, from 'The Hen that laid Diamonds' ([No. 25](gft085.htm#an_25).md)--

<span class="small">The emperor there was dead, and they took his crown
and put it in the church; whosever head the crown falls on, he shall be
emperor. And men of all ranks came into the church; and the three boys
came. And the eldest went before, and slipped into the church; and the
crown floated on to his head. "We have a new emperor." They raised him
shoulder-high, and clad him in royal robes.'</span>

The episode is reminiscent of 'Excalibur' in the old Arthurian legend.
The story in which it occurs is identical with Hahn's No. 36, but there
the episode is wholly wanting. The multiplication of such seemingly
unique Gypsy stories and incidents would certainly favour a belief in
the originality of the Gypsies, would suggest that

<span id="page_lxvi">p. lxvi</span>

some at least of their stories are at first-hand, and not derived from
Greeks, Roumans, Slavs, Teutons, or Celts.

Still, nothing would surprise me less than to come on non-Gypsy versions
of one or all of these stories or incidents. The great mass of the
collection can be paralleled from Grimm, Asbjörnsen, Hahn, Campbell,
Cosquin, etc. Thus my [No. 63](gft123.htm#an_63.md) is Grimm's 'Our Lady's
Child' (No. 3); [No. 57](gft117.htm#an_57.md) his 'Youth who went forth to
learn what Fear was' (No. 4); [No. 2](gft062.htm#an_02.md) his 'Faithful
John' (No. 6); [No. 21](gft081.htm#an_21.md) his 'Valiant Little Tailor'
(No. 20); [No. 38](gft098.htm#an_38.md) his 'Devil with the Three Golden
Hairs' (No. 29); [No. 47](gft107.htm#an_47.md) his 'Robber Bridegroom' (No.
40); [No. 70](gft130.htm#an_70) his 'Frederick and Catherine' (No. 59.md);
[No. 25](gft085.htm#an_25) his 'Two Brothers' (No. 60.md); [No.
68](gft128.htm#an_68) his 'Little Peasant' (No. 61.md); [No.
59](gft119.htm#an_59) his 'Brother Lustig' (No. 81.md) and 'Old Man made
Young again' (No. 147); [No. 32](gft092.htm#an_32.md) his 'King of the
Golden Mountains' (No. 92); [No. 17](gft077.htm#an_17.md) his 'Three Little
Birds' (No. 96); Nos. [55](gft115.htm#an_55) and [73](gft133.htm#an_73.md)
his 'Water of Life' (No. 97); [No. 43](gft103.htm#an_43.md) his 'Skilful
Huntsman' (No. 111); [No. 25](gft085.htm#an_25.md) his 'Ferdinand the
Faithful' (No. 126); [No. 41](gft101.htm#an_41.md) his 'Shoes that were
danced to Pieces' (No. 133); Nos. [20](gft080.htm#an_20.md) and
[58](gft118.htm#an_58) his 'Strong Hans' (No. 166.md); and Nos.
[11](gft071.htm#an_11) and [12](gft072.htm#an_12.md) his 'Master Thief'
(No. 192); besides which his 'Cinderella' (No. 21), 'Godfather Death'
(No. 44), and 'The Sole' (No. 172) are known to be current among the
Gypsies. The Gypsies, then, by the showing even of our present meagre
store of Gypsy folk-tales, have over ten per cent. of Grimm's entire
collection.

Which are the better, the Gypsy versions, or the non-Gypsy versions, can
only be definitely determined when we can feel pretty sure of possessing
the best Gypsy versions procurable. Take, for example, our story of 'The
Vampire' ([No. 5](gft065.htm#an_05).md). The wretched Hungarian-Gypsy
version of Dr. Friedrich Miller (1869) could not for a moment compare
with Ralston's fine Russian story of 'The Fiend,' but the
Roumanian-Gypsy version of Barbu Constantinescu (1878) quite well can.
The standard of Gypsy folk-tales should clearly be taken from the best,
not the poorest, specimens; and the standard by that rule is high.
Indeed, 'The Red King and the Witch' to me appears as good as anything
in the whole field of folk-lore; and 'Ashypelt,' 'The Jealous Husband,'
and half a dozen more of my collection seem only less good than it. But,
of course, one's own geese are all swans.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[lxv:1](gft044.htm#fr_25.md) *Not* unique; occurs
also in Wratislaw's Bohemian story, [No. 2](gft062.htm#an_02.md), [p.
21](gft066.htm#page_21.md). But I let the lines stand for a warning against
the vanity of dogmatising.
