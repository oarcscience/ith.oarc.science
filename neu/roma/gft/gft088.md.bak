### No. 28.--The Beautiful Mountain

Somewhere far off were a quarryman and his wife. They had a son in their
old age. They died. An old man comes to beg, and asks boy will he come
with him to seek fortune. They go. 'Wish

me into a horse.' Boy does so. 'Jump on my back.' He does so. They take
the road. Horse warns boy to help anything in distress. Boy finds a
little fish cast up by the tide, and puts it back in the water. Fish
promises gratitude. They cross the Beautiful Mountain. Horse warns boy
to touch nothing. A feather blows in his mouth. He spits it out again
and again, but it returns. He looks at it, thinks it pretty, puts it in
his pocket. They descend other side of the mountain. Boy hears noise of
bellowing in a castle. Finds sick giant in bed, without servant-maid.
Boy gets him food. Giant promises gratitude. Horse asks boy if he
touched anything on mountain. 'Nothing but this feather.' 'That feather
will bring you sorrow, but keep it now you have it.' They come to a
castle. Boy asks for work. Master tests his hand-writing. Engages him.
Wants him to sleep indoors; he prefers stable beside his old horse
(*cf*. Grimm, No. 126, ii. 155, also for *pen*). They marvel at his
penmanship, done with this feather. One day the master's man steals the
pen by a ruse, and brings it to master: 'Master, the man that got the
feather can get the bird.' Boy tells horse what they want him to do.
Horse tells him to ask for three days' leave and three sacks of gold.
Horse and boy go off. They go and get the bird, choosing the dirtiest
and ugliest bird (*cf*. Polish-Gypsy story, [No. 49](gft109.htm#an_49.md),
for choosing bird in common cage). The master's man says, 'Master, the
bird is fair, but fairer still the lady' (that owned it). Boy told to
fetch lady; he tells horse. Horse reminds him that he said the feather
would bring him trouble. Three more days and three purses of gold. Horse
says, 'Wish me into a boat on the sea.' The boat is full of the finest
silk. They sail under the castle. Lure lady on board to see silk. She
goes into cabin. Boy weighs anchor and off. Lady comes up, and drops her
keys into sea. They return. Man says to master, 'Master, the man that
got the lady can get the castle.' Boy tells horse. Horse reminds him of
unlucky feather. Three more days and bags of gold. They go. Horse
reminds boy of giant's promise. Giant puts chain round castle and drags
it along. The castle is walled round and locked. Lady demands her keys.
Boy and horse go off, call the little fish. He fails to find keys. Tries
again and brings them up. Keys given to lady. Lady says, 'Which would
you prefer, Jack, to have your head cut off or your master's head cut
off?' Boy says, 'Cut off mine, not his.' Lady says, 'You have spoken
well. Had you not spoken thus, your own head would have been cut off.
Now the master's head will fall, not yours.' Boy and lady wed, and live
in the castle still. 'Now you've got it.'

<span class="small">It must at least be nearly five hundred years since
the ancestors of our Welsh Gypsies parted from those of their kinsfolk
in Bukowina; yet the resemblance between these two versions still is
marvellous. The talking horse, the entering into service at the castle,
the feather, the fetching the bird, the fetching a lady (in the Bukowina
version not *the* lady), the cabin even, the fetching the lady's
belongings, and the doom of the master--these eight details are common
to both: the very order of them is identical. Non-Gypsy variants are
Grimm's 'Ferdinand the Faithful' (No. 126; ii. 153, 425), Cosquin's 'Le
Roi d’Angleterre et son Filleul' (No. 3, i. 32), his 'La Belle aux
Cheveux d’Or' (No. 72, ii. 290), the Donegal story of 'The Red Pony' in
W. Larmenie's *West Irish Folk-tales* (1893, pp. 211-218), a Russian
story summarised by Ralston (p. 287), and Laura Gonzenbach's long
Sicilian story, 'Die Geschichte von Caruseddu' (No. 83, ii. 143-155,
257-9). All six deserve careful study, but specially the last, which
links these stories to the heroic version of 'The Master Thief'
(*supra*, [p. 51](gft072.htm#page_51).md). For its plot, told briefly, is
this:--Caruseddu and his two elder brothers go as gardeners to a drape
(rendered 'menschenfresser' or 'ogre,' but query rather 'dragon'). By
the Hop-o’-my-thumb device of changing caps, as in 'Tropsyn' (*cf*. also
Hahn, ii. 179-180), Caruseddu deludes him into devouring his own three
daughters. The brothers then take service with a king--Caruseddu as
trusted servant, the others as gardeners. They are jealous of Caruseddu,
and get the king to send him to steal first the *dragu's* talking horse,
next his bed-cover with golden balls, and lastly the *dragu* himself.
This last task he achieves by the trick of getting the *dragu* to try if
a new coffin for (the supposed dead) Caruseddu is big enough. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) Still at his brothers' suggestion,
Caruseddu is now sent to fetch the daughter of the queen with the seven
veils; he achieves this, like his former feats, with the help of the
talking horse. The princess refuses to wed the king unless he recovers
for her the veil and the ring she had lost on the way to him; Caruseddu
recovers them by the aid of a grateful bird and a grateful fish (*cf.*
the Welsh version). He also sifts a barnful of wheat, oats, and barley
with the aid of grateful ants. Lastly, he has to plunge into a fiery
furnace, but, smeared with foam snorted by the talking horse, he emerges
uninjured, far fairer than before. The old and ugly king has to essay
the same ordeal, and asks Caruseddu what he smeared himself with. Who,
sickened at last by his master's ingratitude, answers, 'With fat.' So
the king is burnt to ashes, and Caruseddu marries the princess. Reinhold
Köhler, the learned annotator of Gonzenbach, compares Straparola, iii. 2
(Grimm, ii. 478) and a Wallachian story, where the hero bathes in
boiling milk, which his magic horse blows cold, but in which the king
himself perishes. Wratislaw gives a curious Servian story from
Bosnia,--'The Bird-catcher' (No. 42, pp. 239-245). Here the hero, a
bird-catcher, is advised by a grateful crow, but the horse comes in very
*mal-àpropos* at the finish. *Cf*. also Hahn, ii. 180, 186; and
Clouston's *Eastern Romances*, p. 499, 570.</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_85"></span>[109:1](gft088.htm#fr_85.md) Hahn has the selfsame
story up to this point, only not so well told, 'Von dem Schönen and vom
Drakos' (No. 3, i. 75-79, and ii. 178-86).
