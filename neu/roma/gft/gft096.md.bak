### No. 36.--Happy Boz’ll

Wonst upon a time there was a Romano, and his name was Happy Boz’ll, and
he had a German-silver grinding-barrow, and he used to put his wife and
his child on the top,

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

and he used to go that quick along the road he 'd beat all the coaches.
Then he thought this grinding-barrow was too heavy and clumsy to take
about, and he cut it up and made tent-rods of it. And then his donkey
got away, and he didn't know where it was gone to; and one day he was
going by the tent, and he said to himself, 'Bless my soul, wherever's
that donkey got to?' And there was a tree close by, and the donkey
shouted out and said, 'I'm here, my Happy, getting you a bit o’ stick to
make a fire.' Well, the donkey come down with a lot of sticks, and he
had been up the tree a week, getting firewood. Well then, Happy had a
dog, and he went out one day, the dog one side the hedge, and him the
other. And then he saw two hares. The dog ran after the two; and as he
was going across the field, he cut himself right through with a scythe;
and then one half ran after one hare, and the other after the other.
Then the two halves of the dog catched the two hares; and then the dog
smacked together again; and he said, 'Well, I've got ’em, my Happy'; and
then the dog died. And Happy had a hole in the knee of his breeches, and
he cut a piece of the dog's skin, after it was dead, and sewed it in the
knee of his breeches. And that day twelve months his breeches-knee burst
open, and barked at him. And so that's the end of Happy Boz’ll.

Also Münchausen-like; but I believe it was largely this story, which I
printed on p. 160 of my *In Gypsy Tents*, that led the great Lazarus
Petulengro to remark once to Mr. Sampson, 'Isn't it wonderful, sir, that
a real gentleman could have wrote such a thing--nothing but low language
and povertiness, and not a word of grammar or high-learned talk in it
from beginning to end.'

We have a third Gypsy lying story, a Welsh-Gypsy one. Matthew Wood's
father had, like a good many Gypsies, a contempt for folk-tales, and,
when called on for his turn, he always gave this, the very shortest
one;--'There were a naked man and a blind man and a lame man. The blind
man saw a hare, and the lame man ran and caught it, and the naked man
put it in his pocket.' *Cf*. Grimm's No. 159, 'The Ditmarsch Tale of
Wonders' (ii. 230, 452). Indian lying stories occur in Maive Stokes's
*Indian Fairy Tales*, Nos. 4, 8, 17.
