OF OOD

Men say that if thou comest to Sundari, beyond all the plains, and shalt
climb to his summit before thou art seized by the avalanche which
sitteth always on his slopes, that then there lie before thee many
peaks. And if thou shalt climb these and cross their valleys (of which
there be seven and also seven peaks) thou shalt come at last to the land
of forgotten hills, where amid many valleys and white snow there
standeth the "Great Temple of One god Only."

Therein is a dreaming prophet who doeth naught, and a drowsy priesthood
about him.

These be the priests of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.

Within the temple it is forbidden to work, also it is forbidden to pray.
Night differeth not from day within its doors. They rest as MANA rests.
And the name of their prophet is Ood.

Ood is a greater prophet than any of all the prophets of Earth, and it
hath been said by some that were Ood and his priests to pray chaunting
all together and calling upon MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI that MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI
would then awake, for surely he would hear the prayers of his own
prophet—then would there be Worlds no more.

There is also another way to the land of forgotten hills, which is a
smooth road and a straight, that lies through the heart of the
mountains. But for certain hidden reasons it were better for thee to go
by the peaks and snow, even though thou shouldst perish by the way, that
thou shouldst seek to come to the house of Ood by the smooth, straight
road.
