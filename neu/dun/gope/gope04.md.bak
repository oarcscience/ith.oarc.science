OF SKARL THE DRUMMER

When MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI had made the gods and Skarl, Skarl made a drum,
and began to beat upon it that he might drum for ever. Then because he
was weary after the making of the gods, and because of the drumming of
Skarl, did MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI grow drowsy and fall asleep.

And there fell a hush upon the gods when they saw that MANA rested, and
there was silence on Pegana save for the drumming of Skarl. Skarl
sitteth upon the mist before the feet of MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, above the
gods of Pegana, and there he beateth his drum. Some say that the Worlds
and the Suns are but the echoes of the drumming of Skarl, and others say
that they be dreams that arise in the mind of MANA because of the
drumming of Skarl, as one may dream whose rest is troubled by sound of
song, but none knoweth, for who hath heard the voice of
MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, or who hath seen his drummer?

Whether the season be winter or whether it be summer, whether it be
morning among the worlds or whether it be night, Skarl still beateth his
drum, for the purposes of the gods are not yet fulfilled. Sometimes the
arm of Skarl grows weary; but still he beateth his drum, that the gods
may do the work of the gods, and the worlds go on, for if he cease for
an instant then MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI will start awake, and there will be
worlds nor gods no more.

But, when at the last the arm of Skarl shall cease to beat his drum,
silence shall startle Pegana like thunder in a cave, and
MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI shall cease to rest.

Then shall Skarl put his drum upon his back and walk forth into the void
beyond the worlds, because it is THE END, and the work of Skarl is over.

There may arise some other god whom Skarl may serve, or it may be that
he shall perish; but to Skarl it shall matter not, for he shall have
done the work of Skarl.
