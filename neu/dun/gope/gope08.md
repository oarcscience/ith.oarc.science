THE SAYINGS OF KIB

(Sender of Life in all the Worlds)

Kib said: "I am Kib. I am none other than Kib."

Kib is Kib. Kib is he and no other. Believe! Kib said: "When Time was
early, when Time was very early indeed—there was only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.
MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI was before the beginning of the gods, and shall be
after their going."

And Kib said: "After the going of the gods there will be no small worlds
nor big."

Kib said: "It will be lonely for MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI."

Because this is written, believe! For is it not written, or are you
greater than Kib? Kib is Kib.
