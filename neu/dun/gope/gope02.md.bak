PREFACE

In the mists before THE BEGINNING, Fate and Chance cast lots to decide
whose the Game should be; and he that won strode through the mists to
MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI and said: "Now make gods for Me, for I have won the
cast and the Game is to be Mine." Who it was that won the cast, and
whether it was Fate or whether Chance that went through the mists before
THE BEGINNING to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI—\_none knoweth.\_
