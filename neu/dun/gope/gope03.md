INTRODUCTION

Before there stood gods upon Olympus, or ever Allah was Allah, had
wrought and rested MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.

There are in Pegana Mung and Sish and Kib, and the maker of all small
gods, who is MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI. Moreover, we have a faith in Roon and
Slid.

And it has been said of old that all things that have been were wrought
by the small gods, excepting only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, who made the gods
and hath thereafter rested.

And none may pray to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI but only the gods whom he hath
made.

But at the Last will MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI forget to rest, and will make
again new gods and other worlds, and will destroy the gods whom he hath
made.

And the gods and the worlds shall depart, and there shall be only
MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.
