YONATH THE PROPHET

Yonath was the first among prophets who uttered unto men.

These are the words of Yonath, the first among all prophets:

There be gods upon Pegana.

Upon a night I slept. And in my sleep Pegana came very near. And Pegana
was full of gods.

I saw the gods beside me as one might see wonted things.

Only I saw not MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI.

And in that hour, in the hour of my sleep, I knew.

And the end and the beginning of my knowing, and all of my knowing that
there was, was this—that Man Knoweth Not.

Seek thou to find at night the utter edge of the darkness, or seek to
find the birthplace of the rainbow where he leapeth upward from the
hills, only seek not concerning the wherefore of the making of the gods.

The gods have set a brightness upon the farther side of the Things to
Come that they may appear more felititous to men than the Things that
Are.

To the gods the Things to Come are but as the Things that Are, and
nothing altereth in Pegana.

The gods, although not merciful, are not ferocious gods. They are the
destroyers of the Days that Were, but they set a glory about the Days to
Be.

Man must endure the Days that Are, but the gods have left him his
ignorance as a solace.

Seek not to know. Thy seeking will weary thee, and thou wilt return much
worn, to rest at last about the place from whence thou settest out upon
thy seeking.

Seek not to know. Even I, Yonath, the oldest prophet, burdened with the
wisdom of great years, and worn with seeking, know only that man knoweth
not.

Once I set out seeking to know all things. Now I know one thing only,
and soon the Years will carry me away.

The path of my seeking, that leadeth to seeking again, must be trodden
by very many more, when Yonath is no longer even Yonath.

Set not thy foot upon that path.

Seek not to know.

These be the Words of Yonath.
