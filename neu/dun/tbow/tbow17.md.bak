EPILOGUE

Here the fourteenth Episode of the Book of Wonder endeth and here the
relating of the Chronicles of Little Adventures at the Edge of the
World. I take farewell of my readers. But it may be we shall even meet
again, for it is still to be told how the gnomes robbed the fairies, and
of the vengeance that the fairies took, and how even the gods themselves
were troubled thereby in their sleep; and how the King of Ool insulted
the troubadours, thinking himself safe among his scores of archers and
hundreds of halberdiers, and how the troubadours stole to his towers by
night, and under his battlements by the light of the moon made that king
ridiculous for ever in song. But for this I must first return to the
Edge of the World. Behold, the caravans start.
