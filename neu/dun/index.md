# Lord Dunsany

Edward Plunkett, the 18th Baron of Dunsany, (July 24, 1878-Oct 25, 1957)
was an Anglo-Irish writer known for his tales set in purely invented
fantasy universes under the pen name 'Lord Dunsany.' Most of these
stories were published in collections between 1905 to 1919. He loved
inventing new worlds, each with bits of amusing detail. Dunsany later
turned to writing stage and radio plays. Dunsany had a huge influence on
[H.P. Lovecraft](../../nec/index.md), and his inventive fantasy paved the
way for [J.R.R. Tolkien](../../ring/index.md).
