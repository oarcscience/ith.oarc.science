*VII*

In the valley beyond Sidono there lies a garden of poppies, and where
the poppies' heads are all a-swing with summer breezes that go up the
valley there lies a path well strewn with ocean shells. Over Sidono's
summit the birds come streaming to the lake that lies in the valley of
the garden, and behind them rises the sun sending Sidono's shadow as far
as the edge of the lake. And down the path of many ocean shells when
they begin to gleam in the sun, every morning walks an aged man clad in
a silken robe with strange devices woven. A little temple where the old
man lives stands at the edge of the path. None worship there, for
Zornadhu, the old prophet, hath forsaken men to walk among his poppies.

For Zornadhu hath failed to understand the purport of Kings and cities
and the moving up and down of many people to the tune of the clinking of
gold. Therefore hath Zornadhu gone far away from the sound of cities and
from those that are ensnared thereby, and beyond Sidono's mountain hath
come to rest where there are neither kings nor armies nor bartering for
gold, but only the heads of the poppies that sway in the wind together
and the birds that fly from Sidono to the lake, and then the sunrise
over Sidono's summit; and afterwards the flight of birds out of the lake
and over Sidono again, and sunset behind the valley, and high over lake
and garden the stars that know not cities. There Zornadhu lives in his
garden of poppies with Sidono standing between him and the whole world
of men; and when the wind blowing athwart the valley sways the heads of
the tall poppies against the Temple wall, the old prophet says: "The
flowers are all praying, and lo! they be nearer to the gods than men."

But the heralds of the King coming after many days of travel to Sidono
perceived the garden valley. By the lake they saw the poppy garden
gleaming round and small like a sunrise over water on a misty morning
seen by some shepherd from the hills. And descending the bare mountain
for three days they came to the gaunt pines, and ever between the tall
trunks came the glare of the poppies that shone from the garden valley.
For a whole day they travelled through the pines. That night a cold wind
came up the garden valley crying against the poppies. Low in his Temple,
with a song of exceeding grief, Zornadhu in the morning made a dirge for
the passing of poppies, because in the night time there had fallen
petals that might not return or ever come again into the garden valley.
Outside the Temple on the path of ocean shells the heralds halted, and
read the names and honours of the King; and from the Temple came the
voice of Zornadhu still singing his lament. But they took him from his
garden because of the King's command, and down his gleaming path of
ocean shells and away up Sidono, and left the Temple empty with none to
lament when silken poppies died. And the will of the wind of the autumn
was wrought upon the poppies, and the heads of the poppies that rose
from the earth went down to the earth again, as the plume of a warrior
smitten in a heathen fight far away, where there are none to lament him.
Thus out of his land of flowers went Zornadhu and came perforce into the
lands of men, and saw cities, and in the city's midst stood up before
the King.

And the King said:

"Zornadhu, what of the journey of the King and of the princes and the
people that shall meet me?"

Zornadhu answered:

"I know nought of Kings, but in the night time the poppy made his
journey a little before dawn. Thereafter the wildfowl came as is their
wont over Sidono's summit, and the sun rising behind them gleamed upon
Sidono, and all the flowers of the lake awoke. And the bee passing up
and down the garden went droning to other poppies, and the flowers of
the lake, they that had known the poppy, knew him no more. And the sun's
rays slanting from Sidono's crest lit still a garden valley where one
poppy waved his petals to the dawn no more. And I, O King, that down a
path of gleaming ocean shells walk in the morning, found not, nor have
since found, that poppy again, that hath gone on the journey whence
there is not returning, out of my garden valley. And I, O King, made a
dirge to cry beyond that valley and the poppies bowed their heads; but
there is no cry nor no lament that may adjure the life to return again
to a flower that grew in a garden once and hereafter is not.

"Unto what place the lives of poppies have gone no man shall truly say.
Sure it is that to that place are only outward tracks. Only it may be
that when a man dreams at evening in a garden where heavily the scent of
poppies hangs in the air, when the winds have sunk, and far away the
sound of a lute is heard on lonely hills, as he dreams of silken-scarlet
poppies that once were a-swing together in the gardens of his youth, the
lives of those old lost poppies shall return, living again in his dream.
\*So there may dream the gods.\* And through the dreams of some divinity
reclining in tinted fields above the morning we may haply pass again,
although our bodies have long swirled up and down the world with other
dust. In these strange dreams our lives may be again, all in the centre
of our hopes, rejoicings and laments, until above the morning the gods
wake to go about their work, haply to remember still Their idle dreams,
haply to dream them all again in the stillness when shines the starlight
of the gods."
