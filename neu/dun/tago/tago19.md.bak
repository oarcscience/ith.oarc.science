THE RELENTING OF SARNIDAC

The lame boy Sarnidac tended sheep on a hill to the southward of the
city. Sarnidac was a dwarf and greatly derided in the city. For the
women said:

"It is very funny that Sarnidac is a dwarf," and they would point their
fingers at him saying:—"This is Sarnidac, he is a dwarf; also he is very
lame."

Once the doors of all the temples in the world swung open to the
morning, and Sarnidac with his sheep upon the hill saw strange figures
going down the white road, always southwards. All the morning he saw the
dust rising above the strange figures and always they went southwards
right as far as the rim of the Nydoon hills where the white road could
be seen no more. And the figures stooped and seemed to be larger than
men, but all men seemed very large to Sarnidac, and he could not see
clearly through the dust. And Sarnidac shouted to them, as he hailed all
people that passed down the long white road, and none of the figures
looked to left or right and none of them turned to answer Sarnidac. But
then few people ever answered him because he was lame, and a small
dwarf.

Still the figures went striding swiftly, stooping forward through the
dust, till at last Sarnidac came running down his hill to watch them
closer. As he came to the white road the last of the figures passed him,
and Sarnidac ran limping behind him down the road.

For Sarnidac was weary of the city wherein all derided him, and when he
saw these figures all hurrying away he thought that they went perhaps to
some other city beyond the hills over which the sun shone brighter, or
where there was more food, for he was poor, even perhaps where people
had not the custom of laughing at Sarnidac. So this procession of
figures that stooped and seemed larger than men went southward down the
road and a lame dwarf hobbled behind them.

Khamazan, now called the City of the Last of Temples, lies southward of
the Nydoon hills. This is the story of Pompeides, now chief prophet of
the only temple in the world, and greatest of all the prophets that have
been:

On the slopes of Nydoon I was seated once above Khamazan. There I saw
figures in the morning striding through much dust along the road that
leads across the world. Striding up the hill they came towards me, not
with the gait of men, and soon the first one came to the crest of the
hill where the road dips to find the plains again, where lies Khamazan.
And now I swear by all the gods that are gone that this thing happened
as I shall say it, and was surely so. When those that came striding up
the hill came to its summit they took not the road that goes down into
the plains nor trod the dust any longer, but went straight on and
upwards, striding as they strode before, as though the hill had not
ended nor the road dipped. And they strode as though they trod no
yielding substance, yet they stepped upwards through the air.

This the gods did, for They were not born men who strode that day so
strangely away from earth.

But I, when I saw this thing, when already three had passed me, leaving
earth, cried out before the fourth:

'Gods of my childhood, guardians of little homes, whither are ye going,
leaving the round earth to swim alone and forgotten in so great a waste
of sky?'

And one answered:

'Heresy apace shoots her fierce glare over the world and men's faith
grows dim and the gods go. Men shall make iron gods and gods of steel
when the wind and the ivy meet within the shrines of the temples of the
gods of old.'

And I left that place as a man leaves fire by night, and going
plainwards down the white road that the gods spurned cried out to all
that I passed to follow me, and so crying came to the city's gates. And
there I shouted to all near the gates:

'From yonder hilltop the gods are leaving earth.'

Then I gathered many, and we all hastened to the hill to pray the gods
to tarry, and there we cried out to the last of the departing gods:

'Gods of old prophecy and of men's hopes, leave not the earth, and all
our worship shall hum about Your ears as never it hath before, and oft
the sacrifice shall squeal upon Your altars.'

And I said:—

'Gods of still evenings and quiet nights, go not from earth and leave
not Your carven shrines, and all men shall worship You still. For
between us and yonder still blue spaces oft roam the thunder and the
storms, there in his hiding lurks the dark eclipse, and there are stored
all snows and hails and lightnings that shall vex the earth for a
million years. Gods of our hopes, how shall men's prayers crying from
empty shrines pass through such terrible spaces; how shall they ever
fare above the thunder and many storms to whatever place the gods may go
in that blue waste beyond?'

But the gods bent straight forward, and trampled through the sky and
looked not to the right nor left nor downwards, nor ever heeded my
prayer.

And one cried out hoping yet to stay the gods, though nearly all were
gone, saying:—

'O gods, rob not the earth of the dim hush that hangs round all Your
temples, bereave not all the world of old romance, take not the glamour
from the moonlight nor tear the wonder out of the white mists in every
land; for, O ye gods of the childhood of the world, when You have left
the earth you shall have taken the mystery from the sea and all its
glory from antiquity, and You shall have wrenched out hope from the dim
future. There shall be no strange cries at night time half understood,
nor songs in the twilight, and the whole of the wonder shall have died
with last year's flowers in little gardens or hill-slopes leaning south;
for with the gods must go the enchantment of the plains and all the
magic of dark woods, and something shall be lacking from the quiet of
early dawn. For it would scarce befit the gods to leave the earth and
not take with Them that which They had given it. Out beyond the still
blue spaces Ye will need the holiness of sunset for Yourselves and
little sacred memories and the thrill that is in stories told by
firesides long ago. One strain of music, one song, one line of poetry
and one kiss, and a memory of one pool with rushes, and each one the
best, shall the gods take to whom the best belongs, when the gods go.

'Sing a lamentation, people of Khamazan, sing a lamentation for all the
children of earth at the feet of the departing gods. Sing a lamentation
for the children of earth who now must carry their prayers to empty
shrines and around empty shrines must rest at last.'

Then when our prayers were ended and our tears shed, we beheld the last
and smallest of the gods halted upon the hilltop. Twice he called to
Them with a cry somewhat like the cry wherewith our shepherds hail their
brethren, and long gazed after Them, and then deigned to look no longer
and to tarry upon earth and turn his eyes on men. Then a great shout
went up when we saw that our hopes were saved and that there was still
on earth a haven for our prayers. Smaller than men now seemed the
figures that had loomed so big, as one behind the other far over our
heads They still strode upwards. But the small god that had pitied the
world came with us down the hill, still deigning to tread the road,
though strangely, not as men tread, and into Khamazan. There we housed
him in the palace of the King, for that was before the building of the
temple of gold, and the King made sacrifice before him with his own
hands, and he that had pitied the world did eat the flesh of the
sacrifice.

And the Book of the Knowledge of the gods in Khamazan tells how the
small god that pitied the world told his prophets that his name was
Sarnidac and that he herded sheep, and that therefore he is called the
shepherd god, and sheep are sacrificed upon his altars thrice a day, and
the North, East, West and the South are the four hurdles of Sarnidac and
the white clouds are his sheep. And the Book of the Knowledge of the
gods tells further how the day on which Pompeides found the gods shall
be kept for ever as a fast until the evening and called the Fast of the
Departing, but in the evening shall a feast be held which is named the
Feast of the Relenting, for on that evening Sarnidac pitied the whole
world and tarried.

And the people of Khamazan all prayed to Sarnidac, and dreamed their
dreams and hoped their hopes because their temple was not empty. Whether
the gods that are departed be greater than Sarnidac none know in
Khamazan, but some believe that in their azure windows They have set
lights that lost prayers swarming upwards may come to them like moths
and at last find haven and light far up above the evening and the
stillness where sit the gods.

But Sarnidac wondered at the strange figures, at the people of Khamazan,
and at the palace of the King and the customs of the prophets, but
wondered not more greatly at aught in Khamazan than he had wondered at
the city which he had left. For Sarnidac, who had not known why men were
unkind to him, thought that he had found at last the land for which the
gods had let him hope, where men should have the custom of being kind to
Sarnidac.
