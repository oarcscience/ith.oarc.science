THE JEST OF THE GODS

Once the Older gods had need of laughter. Therefore They made the soul
of a king, and set in it ambitions greater than kings should have, and
lust for territories beyond the lust of other kings, and in this soul
They set strength beyond the strength of others and fierce desire for
power and a strong pride. Then the gods pointed earthward and sent that
soul into the fields of men to live in the body of a slave. And the
slave grew, and the pride and lust for power began to arise in his
heart, and he wore shackles on his arms. Then in the Fields of Twilight
the gods prepared to laugh.

But the slave went down to the shore of the great sea, and cast his body
away and the shackles that were upon it, and strode back to the Fields
of Twilight and stood up before the gods and looked Them in Their faces.
This thing the gods, when They had prepared to laugh, had not foreseen.
Lust for power burned strong in that King's soul, and there was all the
strength and pride in it that the gods had placed therein, and he was
too strong for the Older gods. He whose body had borne the lashes of men
could brook no longer the dominion of the gods, and standing before Them
he bade the gods to go. Up to Their lips leapt all the anger of the
Older gods, being for the first time commanded, but the King's soul
faced Them still, and Their anger died away and They averted Their eyes.
Then Their thrones became empty, and the Fields of Twilight bare as the
gods slunk far away. But the soul chose new companions.
