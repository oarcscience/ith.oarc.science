*III*

Then spake Monith, Prophet of the Temple of Azure that stands on the
snow-peak of Ahmoon and said: "All knowledge is with the King. Once thou
didst set out upon a one day's journey riding thy horse and before thee
had gone a beggar down the road, and his name was Yeb. Him thou didst
overtake and when he heeded not thy coming thou didst ride over him.

"Upon the journey that thou shalt one day take riding upon no horse,
this beggar has set out before thee and is labouring up the crystal
steps towards the moon as a man goeth up the steps of a high tower in
the dark. On the moon's edge beneath the shadow of Mount Angises he
shall rest awhile and then shall climb the crystal steps again. Then a
great journey lies before him before he may rest again till he come to
that star that is called the left eye of Gundo. Then a journey of many
crystal steps lieth before him again with nought to guide him but the
light of Omrazu. On the edge of Omrazu shall Yeb tarry long, for the
most dreadful part of his journey lieth before him. Up the crystal steps
that lie beyond Omrazu he must go, and any that follow, though the
howling of all the meteors that ride the sky; for in that part of the
crystal space go many meteors up and down all squealing in the dark,
which greatly perplex all travellers. And, if he may see though the
gleaming of the meteors and in spite of their uproar come safely
through, he shall come to the star Omrund at the edge of the Track of
Stars. And from star to star along the Track of Stars the soul of a man
may travel with more ease, and there the journey lies no more straight
forward, but curves to the right."

Then said King Ebalon:

"Of this beggar whom my horse smote down thou hast spoken much, but I
sought to know by what road a King should go when he taketh his last
royal journey, and what princes and what people should meet him upon
another shore."

Then answered Monith:

"All knowledge is with the King. It hath been doomed by the gods, who
speak not in jest, that thou shalt follow the soul that thou didst send
alone upon its journey, that that soul go not unattended up the crystal
steps.

"Moreover, as this beggar went upon his lonely journey he dared to curse
the King, and his curses lie like a red mist along the valleys and
hollows wherever he uttered them. By these red mists, O King, thou shalt
track him as a man follows a river by night until thou shalt fare at
last to the land wherein he hath blessed thee (repenting of anger at
last), and thou shalt see his blessing lie over the land like a blaze of
golden sunshine illumining fields and gardens."

Then said the King:

"The gods have spoken hard above the snowy peak of this mountain
Ahmoon."

And Monith said:

"How a man may come to the shore of space beyond the tides of time I
know not, but it is doomed that thou shalt certainly first follow the
beggar past the moon, Omrund and Omrazu till thou comest to the Track of
Stars, and up the Track of Stars coming towards the right along the edge
of it till thou comest to Ingazi. There the soul of the beggar Yeb sat
long, then, breathing deep, set off on his great journey earthward adown
the crystal steps. Straight through the spaces where no stars are found
to rest at, following the dull gleam of earth and her fields till he
come at last where journeys end and start."

Then said King Ebalon:

"If this hard tale be true, how shall I find the beggar that I must
follow when I come again to the earth?"

And the Prophet answered:

"Thou shalt know him by his name and find him in this place, for that
beggar shall be called King Ebalon and he shall be sitting upon the
throne of the Kings of Zarkandhu."

And the King answered:

"If one sit upon this throne whom men call King Ebalon, who then shall I
be?"

And the Prophet answered:

"Thou shalt be a beggar and thy name shall be Yeb, and thou shalt ever
tread the road before the palace waiting for alms from the King whom men
shall call Ebalon."

Then said the King:

"Hard gods indeed are those that tramp the snows of Ahmoon about the
temple of Azure, for if I sinned against this beggar called Yeb, they
too have sinned against him when they doomed him to travel on this weary
journey though he hath not offended."

And Monith said:

"He too hath offended, for he was angry as thy horse struck him, and the
gods smite anger. And his anger and his curses doom him to journey
without rest as also they doom thee."

Then said the King:

"Thou that sittest upon Ahmoon in the Temple of Azure, dreaming thy
dreams and making prophecies, foresee the ending of this weary quest and
tell me where it shall be?"

And Monith answered:

"As a man looks across great lakes I have gazed into the days to be, and
as the great flies come upon four wings of gauze to skim over blue
waters, so have my dreams come sailing two by two out of the days to be.
And I dreamed that King Ebalon, whose soul was not thy soul, stood in
his palace in a time far hence, and beggars thronged the street outside,
and among them was Yeb, a beggar, having thy soul. And it was on the
morning of a festival and the King came robed in white, with all his
prophets and his seers and magicians, all down the marble steps to bless
the land and all that stood therein as far as the purple hills, because
it was the morning of festival. And as the King raised up his hand over
the beggars' heads to bless the fields and rivers and all that stood
therein, I dreamed that the quest was ended.

"All knowledge is with the King."
