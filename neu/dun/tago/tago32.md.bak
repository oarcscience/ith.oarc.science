*XI*

Then Ulf spake, the prophet who in Sistrameides lives in a temple
anciently dedicated to the gods. Rumour hath guessed that there the gods
walked once some time towards evening. But Time whose hand is against
the temples of the gods hath dealt harshly with it and overturned its
pillars and set upon its ruins his sign and seal: now Ulf dwells there
alone. And Ulf said, "There sets, O King, a river outward from earth
which meets with a mighty sea whose waters roll through space and fling
their billows on the shores of every star. These are the river and the
sea of the Tears of Men."

And the King said:

"Men have not written of this sea."

And the prophet answered:

"Have not tears enough burst in the night time out of sleeping cities?
Have not the sorrows of 10,000 homes sent streams into this river when
twilight fell and it was still and there was none to hear? Have there
not been hopes, and were they all fulfilled? Have there not been
conquests and bitter defeats? And have not flowers when spring was over
died in the gardens of many children? Tears enough, O King, tears enough
have gone down out of earth to make such a sea; and deep it is and wide
and the gods know it and it flings its spray on the shores of all the
stars. Down this river and across this sea thou shalt fare in a ship of
sighs and all around thee over the sea shall fly the prayers of men
which rise on white wings higher than their sorrows. Sometimes perched
in the rigging, sometimes crying around thee, shall go the prayers that
availed not to stay thee in Zarkandhu. Far over the waters, and on the
wings of the prayers beats the light of an inaccessible star. No hand
hath touched it, none hath journeyed to it, it hath no substance, it is
only a light, it is the star of Hope, and it shines far over the sea and
brightens the world. It is nought but a light, but the gods gave it.

"Led only by the light of this star the myriad prayers that thou shalt
see all around thee fly to the Hall of the gods.

"Sighs shall waft thy ship of sighs over the sea of Tears. Thou shalt
pass by islands of laughter and lands of song lying low in the sea, and
all of them drenched with tears flung over their rocks by the waves of
the sea all driven by the sighs.

"But at last thou shalt come with the prayers of men to the great Hall
of the gods where the chairs of the gods are carved of onyx grouped
round the golden throne of the eldest of the gods. And there, O King,
hope not to find the gods, but reclining upon the golden throne wearing
a cloak of his master's thou shalt see the figure of Time with blood
upon his hands, and loosely dangling from his fingers a dripping sword,
and spattered with blood but empty shall stand the onyx chairs.

"There he sits on his master's throne dangling idly his sword, or with
it flicking cruelly at the prayers of men that lie in a great heap
bleeding at his feet.

"For a while, O King, the gods had sought to solve the riddles of Time,
for a while They made him Their slave, and Time smiled and obeyed his
masters, for a while, O King, for a while. He that hath spared nothing
hath not spared the gods, nor yet shall he spare thee."

Then the King spake dolefully in the Hall of Kings, and said:

"May I not find at last the gods, and must it be that I may not look in
Their faces at the last to see whether They be kindly? They that have
sent me on my earthward journey I would greet on my returning, if not as
a King coming again to his own city, yet as one who having been ordered
had obeyed, and obeying had merited something of those for whom he
toiled. I would look Them in Their faces, O prophet, and ask Them
concerning many things and would know the wherefore of much. I had
hoped, O prophet, that those gods that had smiled upon my childhood,
Whose voices stirred at evening in gardens when I was young, would hold
dominion still when at last I came to seek Them. O prophet, if this is
not to be, make you a great dirge for my childhood's gods and fashion
silver bells and, setting them mostly a-swing amidst such trees as grew
in the garden of my childhood, sing you this dirge in the dusk: and sing
it when the low moth flies up and down and the bat first comes peering
from her home, sing it when white mists come rising from the river, when
smoke is pale and grey, while flowers are yet closing, ere voices are
yet hushed, sing it while all things yet lament the day, or ever the
great lights of heaven come blazing forth and night with her splendours
takes the place of day. For, if the old gods die, let us lament Them or
ever new knowledge comes, while all the world still shudders at Their
loss.

"For at the last, O prophet, what is left? Only the gods of my childhood
dead, and only Time striding large and lonely through the spaces,
chilling the moon and paling the light of stars and scattering earthward
out of both his hands the dust of forgetfulness over the fields of
heroes and smitten Temples of the older gods."

But when the other prophets heard with what doleful words the King spake
in the Hall they all cried out:

"It is not as Ulf has said but as I have said—and I."

Then the King pondered long, not speaking. But down in the city in a
street between the houses stood grouped together they that were wont to
dance before the King, and they that had borne his wine in jewelled
cups. Long they had tarried in the city hoping that the King might
relent, and once again regard them with kindly faces calling for wine
and song. The next morning they were all to set out in search of some
new Kingdom, and they were peering between the houses and up the long
grey street to see for the last time the palace of King Ebalon; and
Pattering Leaves, the dancer, cried:

"Not any more, not any more at all shall we drift up the carven hall to
dance before the King. He that now watches the magic of his prophets
will behold no more the wonder of the dance, and among ancient
parchments, strange and wise, he shall forget the swirl of drapery when
we swing together through the Dance of the Myriad Steps."

And with her were Silvern Fountain and Summer Lightning and Dream of the
Sea, each lamenting that they should dance no more to please the eyes of
the King.

And Intahn who had carried at the banquet for fifty years the goblet of
the King set with its four sapphires each as large as an eye, said as he
spread his hands towards the palace making the sign of farewell:

"Not all the magic of prophecy nor yet foreseeing nor perceiving may
equal the power of wine. Through the small door in the King's Hall one
goes by one hundred steps and many sloping corridors into the cool of
the earth where lies a cavern vaster than the Hall. Therein, curtained
by the spider, repose the casks of wine that are wont to gladden the
hearts of the Kings of Zarkandhu. In islands far to the eastward the
vine, from whose heart this wine was long since wrung, hath climbed
aloft with many a clutching finger and beheld the sea and ships of the
olden time and men since dead, and gone down into the earth again and
been covered over with weeds. And green with the damp of years there lie
three casks that a city gave not up until all her defenders were slain
and her houses fired; and ever to the soul of that wine is added a more
ardent fire as ever the years go by. Thither it was my pride to go
before a banquet in the olden years, and coming up to bear in the
sapphire goblet the fire of the elder Kings and to watch the King's eye
flash and his face grow nobler and more like his sires as he drank the
gleaming wine.

"And now the King seeks wisdom from his prophets while all the glory of
the past and all the clattering splendour of today grows old, far down,
forgotten beneath his feet."

And when he ceased the cupbearers and the women that danced looked long
in silence at the palace. Then one by one all made the farewell sign
before they turned to go, and as they did this a herald unseen in the
dark was speeding towards them.

After a long silence the King spake:

"Prophets of my Kingdom," he said, "you have not prophesied alike, and
the words of each prophet condemn his fellows' words so that wisdom may
not be discovered among prophets. But I command that none in my Kingdom
shall doubt that the earliest King of Zarkandhu stored wine beneath this
palace before the building of the city or ever the palace arose, and I
shall cause commands to be uttered for the making of a banquet at once
within this Hall, so that ye shall perceive that the power of my wine is
greater than all your spells, and dancing more wondrous than prophecy."

The dancers and the winebearers were summoned back, and as the night
wore on a banquet was spread and all the prophets bidden to be seated,
Samahn, Ynath, Monith, Ynar Thun, the prophet of Journeys, Zornadhu,
Yamen, Paharn, Ilana, Ulf, and one that had not spoken nor yet revealed
his name, and who wore his prophet's cloak across his face.

And the prophets feasted as they were commanded and spake as other men
spake, save he whose face was hidden, who neither ate nor spake. Once he
put out his hand from under his cloak and touched a blossom among the
flowers upon the table and the blossom fell.

And Pattering Leaves came in and danced again, and the King smiled, and
Pattering Leaves was happy though she had not the wisdom of the
prophets. And in and out, in and out, in and out among the columns of
the Hall went Summer Lightning in the maze of the dance. And Silvern
Fountain bowed before the King and danced and danced and bowed again,
and old Intahn went to and fro from the cavern to the King gravely
through the midst of the dancers but with kindly eyes, and when the King
had often drunk of the old wine of the elder Kings he called for Dream
of the Sea and bade her sing. And Dream of the Sea came through the
arches and sang of an island builded by magic out of pearls, that lay
set in a ruby sea, and how it lay far off and under the south, guarded
by jagged reefs whereon the sorrows of the world were wrecked and never
came to the island. And how a low sunset always reddened the sea and lit
the magic isle and never turned to night, and how someone sang always
and endlessly to lure the soul of a King who might by enchantment pass
the guarding reefs to find rest on the pearl island and not be troubled
more, but only see sorrows on the outer reef battered and broken. Then
Soul of the South rose up and sang a song of a fountain that ever sought
to reach the sky and was ever doomed to fall to the earth again until at
last....

Then whether it was the art of Pattering Leaves or the song of Dream of
the Sea, or whether it was the fire of the wine of the elder Kings,
Ebalon bade farewell kindly to the prophets when morning paled the
stars. Then along the torchlit corridors the King went to his chamber,
and having shut the door in the empty room, beheld suddenly a figure
wearing the cloak of a prophet; and the King perceived that it was he
whose face was hidden at the banquet, who had not revealed his name.

And the King said:

"Art thou, too, a prophet?"

And the figure answered:

"I am a prophet."

And the King said: "Knowest *thou* aught concerning the journey of the
King?" And the figure answered: "I know, but have never said."

And the King said: "Who art thou that knowest so much and has not told
it?"

And he answered:

"I am *The End*."

Then the cloaked figure strode away from the palace; and the King,
unseen by the guards, followed upon his journey.

THE END
