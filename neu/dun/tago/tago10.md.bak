THE SORROW OF SEARCH

It is told also of King Khanazar how he bowed very low unto the gods of
Old. None bowed so low unto the gods of Old as did King Khanazar.

One day the King returning from the worship of the gods of Old and from
bowing before them in the temple of the gods commanded their prophets to
appear before him, saying:

"I would know somewhat concerning the gods."

Then came the prophets before King Khanazar, burdened with many books,
to whom the King said:

"It is not in books."

Thereat the prophets departed, bearing away with them a thousand methods
well devised in books whereby men may gain wisdom of the gods. One alone
remained, a master prophet, who had forgotten books, to whom the King
said:

"The gods of Old are mighty."

And answered the master prophet:

"Very mighty are the gods of Old."

Then said the King:

"There are no gods but the gods of Old."

And answered the prophet:

"There are none other."

And they two being alone within the palace the King said:

"Tell me aught concerning gods or men if aught of the truth be known."

Then said the master prophet:

"Far and white and straight lieth the road to Knowing, and down it in
the heat and dust go all wise people of the earth, but in the fields
before they come to it the very wise lie down or pluck the flowers. By
the side of the road to Knowing—O King, it is hard and hot—stand many
temples, and in the doorway of every temple stand many priests, and they
cry to the travellers that weary of the road, crying to them:

"This is the End."

And in the temples are the sounds of music, and from each roof arises
the savour of pleasant burning; and all that look at a cool temple,
whichever temple they look at, or hear the hidden music, turn in to see
whether it be indeed the End. And such as find that their temple is not
indeed the End set forth again upon the dusty road, stopping at each
temple as they pass for fear they miss the End, or striving onwards on
the road, and see nothing in the dust, till they can walk no longer and
are taken worn and weary of their journey into some other temple by a
kindly priest who shall tell them that this also is the End. Neither on
that road may a man gain any guiding from his fellows, for only one
thing that they say is surely true, when they say:

"Friend, we can see nothing for the dust."

And of the dust that hides the way much has been there since ever that
road began, and some is stirred up by the feet of all that travel upon
it, and more arises from the temple doors.

And, O King, it were better for thee, travelling upon that road, to rest
when thou hearest one calling: "This is the End," with the sounds of
music behind him. And if in the dust and darkness thou pass by Lo and
Mush and the pleasant temple of Kynash, or Sheenath with his opal smile,
or Sho with his eyes of agate, yet Shilo and Mynarthitep, Gazo and
Amurund and Slig are still before thee and the priests of their temples
will not forget to call thee.

And, O King, it is told that only one discerned the end and passed by
three thousand temples, and the priests of the last were like the
priests of the first, and all said that their temple was at the end of
the road, and the dark of the dust lay over them all, and all were very
pleasant and only the road was weary. And in some were many gods, and in
a few only one, and in some the shrine was empty, and all had many
priests, and in all the travellers were happy as they rested. And into
some his fellow travellers tried to force him, and when he said:

"I will travel further," many said:

"This man lies, for the road ends here."

And he that travelled to the End hath told that when the thunder was
heard upon the road there arose the sound of the voices of all the
priests as far as he could hear, crying:

"Hearken to Shilo"—"Hear Mush"—"Lo! Kynash"—"The voice of
Sho"—"Mynarthitep is angry"—"Hear the word of Slig!"

And far away along the road one cried to the traveller that Sheenath
stirred in his sleep.

O King this is very doleful. It is told that that traveller came at last
to the utter End and there was a mighty gulf, and in the darkness at the
bottom of the gulf one small god crept, no bigger than a hare, whose
voice came crying in the cold:

"I know not."

And beyond the gulf was nought, only the small god crying.

And he that travelled to the End fled backwards for a great distance
till he came to temples again, and entering one where a priest cried:

"This is the End," lay down and rested on a couch. There Yush sat
silent, carved with an emerald tongue and two great eyes of sapphire,
and there many rested and were happy. And an old priest, coming from
comforting a child, came over to that traveller who had seen the End and
said to him:

"This is Yush and this is the End of wisdom."

And the traveller answered:

"Yush is very peaceful and this indeed the End."

"O King, wouldst thou hear more?"

And the King said:

"I would hear all."

And the master prophet answered:

"There was also another prophet and his name was Shaun, who had such
reverence for the gods of Old that he became able to discern their forms
by starlight as they strode, unseen by others, among men. Each night did
Shaun discern the forms of the gods and every day he taught concerning
them, till men in Averon knew how the gods appeared all grey against the
mountains, and how Rhoog was higher than Mount Scagadon, and how Skun
was smaller, and how Asgool leaned forward as he strode, and how Trodath
peered about him with small eyes. But one night as Shaun watched the
gods of Old by starlight, he faintly discerned some other gods that sat
far up the slopes of the mountains in the stillness behind the gods of
Old. And the next day he hurled his robe away that he wore as Averon's
prophet and said to his people:

"There be gods greater than the gods of Old, three gods seen faintly on
the hills by starlight looking on Averon."

And Shaun set out and travelled many days and many people followed him.
And every night he saw more clearly the shapes of the three new gods who
sat silent when the gods of Old were striding among men. On the higher
slopes of the mountain Shaun stopped with all his people, and there they
built a city and worshipped the gods, whom only Shaun could see, seated
above them on the mountain. And Shaun taught how the gods were like grey
streaks of light seen before dawn, and how the god on the right pointed
upward toward the sky, and how the god on the left pointed downward
toward the ground, but the god in the middle slept.

And in the city Shaun's followers built three temples. The one on the
right was a temple for the young, and the one on the left a temple for
the old, and the third was a temple for the old, and the third was a
temple with doors closed and barred—therein none ever entered. One night
as Shaun watched before the three gods sitting like pale light against
the mountain, he saw on the mountain's summit two gods that spake
together and pointed, mocking the gods of the hill, only he heard no
sound. The next day Shaun set out and a few followed him to climb to the
mountain's summit in the cold, to find the gods who were so great that
they mocked at the silent three. And near the two gods they halted and
built for themselves huts. Also they built a temple wherein the Two were
carved by the hand of Shaun with their heads turned towards each other,
with mockery on Their faces and Their fingers pointing, and beneath Them
were carved the three gods of the hill as actors making sport. None
remembered now Asgool, Trodath, Skun, and Rhoog, the gods of Old.

For many years Shaun and his few followers lived in their huts upon the
mountain's summit worshipping gods that mocked, and every night Shaun
saw the two gods by starlight as they laughed to one another in the
silence. And Shaun grew old.

One night as his eyes were turned towards the Two, he saw across the
mountains in the distance a great god seated in the plain and looming
enormous to the sky, who looked with angry eyes towards the Two as they
sat and mocked. Then said Shaun to his people, the few that had followed
him thither:

"Alas that we may not rest, but beyond us in the plain sitteth the one
true god and he is wroth with mocking. Let us therefore leave these two
that sit and mock and let us find the truth in the worship of that
greater god, who even though he kill shall yet not mock us."

But the people answered:

"Thou hast taken from us many gods and taught us now to worship gods
that mock, and if there is laughter on their faces as we die, lo! thou
alone canst see it, and we would rest."

But three men who had grown old with following followed still.

And down the steep mountain on the further side Shaun led them, saying:

"Now we shall surely know."

And the three old men answered:

"We shall know indeed, O last of all the prophets."

That night the two gods mocking at their worshippers mocked not at Shaun
nor his three followers, who coming to the plain still travelled on till
they came at last to a place where the eyes of Shaun at night could
closely see the vast form of their god. And beyond them as far as the
sky there lay a marsh. There they rested, building such shelters as they
could, and said to one another:

"This is the End, for Shaun discerneth that there are no more gods, and
before us lieth the marsh and old age hath come upon us."

And since they could not labour to build a temple, Shaun carved upon a
rock all that he saw by starlight of the great god of the plain; so that
if ever others forsook the gods of Old because they saw beyond them the
Greater Three, and should thence come to knowledge of the Twain that
mocked, and should yet persevere in wisdom till they saw by starlight
him whom Shaun named the Ultimate god, they should still find there upon
the rock what one had written concerning the end of search. For three
years Shaun carved upon the rock, and rising one night from carving,
saying:

"Now is my labour done," saw in the distance four greater gods beyond
the Ultimate god. Proudly in the distance beyond the marsh these gods
were tramping together, taking no heed of the god upon the plain. Then
said Shaun to his three followers:

"Alas that we know not yet, for there be gods beyond the marsh."

None would follow Shaun, for they said that old age must end all quests,
and that they would rather wait there in the plain for Death than that
he should pursue them across the marsh.

Then Shaun said farewell to his followers, saying:

"You have followed me well since ever we forsook the gods of Old to
worship greater gods. Farewell. It may be that your prayers at evening
shall avail when you pray to the god of the plain, but I must go onward,
for there be gods beyond."

So Shaun went down into the marsh, and for three days struggled through
it, and on the third night saw the four gods not very far away, yet
could not discern Their faces. All the next day Shaun toiled on to see
Their faces by starlight, but ere the night came up or one star shone,
at set of sun, Shaun fell down before the feet of his four gods. The
stars came out, and the faces of the four shone bright and clear, but
Shaun saw them not, for the labour of toiling and seeing was over for
Shaun; and lo! They were Asgool, Trodath, Skun, and Rhoog—The gods of
Old.

Then said the King:

"It is well that the sorrow of search cometh only to the wise, for the
wise are very few."

Also the King said:

"Tell me this thing, O prophet. Who are the true gods?"

The master prophet answered:

"Let the King command."
