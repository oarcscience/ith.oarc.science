ROSES

I know a roadside where the wild rose blooms with a strange abundance.
There is a beauty in the blossoms too of an almost exotic kind, a taint
of deeper pink that shocks the Puritan flowers. Two hundred generations
ago (generations, I mean, of roses) this was a village street; there was
a floral decadence when they left their simple life and the roses came
from the wilderness to clamber round houses of men.

Of all the memories of that little village, of all the cottages that
stood there, of all the men and women whose homes they were, nothing
remains but a more beautiful blush on the faces of the roses.

I hope that when London is clean passed away and the defeated fields
come back again, like an exiled people returning after a war, they may
find some beautiful thing to remind them of it all; because we have
loved a little that swart old city.
