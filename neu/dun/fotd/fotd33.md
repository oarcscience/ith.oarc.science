A LOSING GAME

Once in a tavern Man met face to skull with Death. Man entered gaily but
Death gave no greeting, he sat with his jowl morosely over an ominous
wine.

"Come, come," said Man, "we have been antagonists long, and if I were
losing yet I should not be surly."

But Death remained unfriendly watching his bowl of wine and gave no word
in answer.

Then Man solicitously moved nearer to him and, speaking cheerily still,
"Come, come," he said again, "you must not resent defeat."

And still Death was gloomy and cross and sipped at his infamous wine and
would not look up at Man and would not be companionable.

But Man hated gloom either in beast or god, and it made him unhappy to
see his adversary's discomfort, all the more because he was the cause,
and still he tried to cheer him.

"Have you not slain the Dinatherium?" he said. "Have you not put out the
Moon? Why! you will beat me yet."

And with a dry and barking sound Death wept and nothing said; and
presently Man arose and went wondering away; for he knew not if Death
wept out of pity for his opponent, or because he knew that he should not
have such sport again when the old game was over and Man was gone, or
whether because perhaps, for some hidden reason, he could never repeat
on Earth his triumph over the Moon.
