COMPROMISE

They built their gorgeous home, their city of glory, above the lair of
the earthquake. They built it of marble and gold in the shining youth of
the world. There they feasted and fought and called their city immortal,
and danced and sang songs to the gods. None heeded the earthquake in all
those joyous streets. And down in the deeps of the earth, on the black
feet of the abyss, they that would conquer Man mumbled long in the
darkness, mumbled and goaded the earthquake to try his strength with
that city, to go forth blithely at night and to gnaw its pillars like
bones. And down in those grimy deeps the earthquake answered them, and
would not do their pleasure and would not stir from thence, for who knew
who they were who danced all day where he rumbled, and what if the lords
of that city that had no fear of his anger were haply even the gods!

And the centuries plodded by, on and on round the world, and one day
they that had danced, they that had sung in that city, remembered the
lair of the earthquake in the deeps down under their feet, and made
plans one with another and sought to avert the danger, sought to appease
the earthquake and turn his anger away.

They sent down singing girls, and priests with oats and wine, they sent
down garlands and propitious berries, down by dark steps to the black
depths of the earth, they sent peacocks newly slain, and boys with
burning spices, and their thin white sacred cats with collars of pearls
all newly drawn from sea, they sent huge diamonds down in coffers of
teak, and ointment and strange oriental dyes, arrows and armor and the
rings of their queen.

"Oho," said the earthquake in the coolth of the earth, "so they are not
the gods."
