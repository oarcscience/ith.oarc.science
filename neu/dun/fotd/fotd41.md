THE TROUBLE IN LEAFY GREEN STREET

She went to the idol-shop in Moleshill Street, where the old man
mumbles, and said: "I want a god to worship when it is wet."

The old man reminded her of the heavy penalties that rightly attach to
idolatry and, when he had enumerated all, she answered him as was meet:
"Give me a god to worship when it is wet."

And he went to the back places of his shop and sought out and brought
her a god. The same was carved of grey stone and wore a propitious look
and was named, as the old man mumbled, The God of Rainy Cheerfulness.

Now it may be that long confinement to the house affects adversely the
liver, or these things may be of the soul, but certain it is that on a
rainy day her spirits so far descended that those cheerful creatures
came within sight of the Pit, and, having tried cigarettes to no good
end, she bethought her of Moleshill Street and the mumbling man.

He brought the grey idol forth and mumbled of guarantees, although he
put nothing on paper, and she paid him there and then his preposterous
price and took the idol away.

And on the next wet day that there ever was she prayed to the grey-stone
idol that she had bought, the God of Rainy Cheerfulness (who knows with
what ceremony or what lack of it?), and so brought down on her in Leafy
Green Street, in the preposterous house at the corner, that doom of
which all men speak.
