THE MIST

The mist said unto the mist: "Let us go up into the Downs." And the mist
came up weeping.

And the mist went into the high places and the hollows.

And clumps of trees in the distance stood ghostly in the haze.

But I went to a prophet, one who loved the Downs, and I said to him:
"Why does the mist come up weeping into the Downs when it goes into the
high places and the hollows?"

And he answered: "The mist is the company of a multitude of souls who
never saw the Downs, and now are dead. Therefore they come up weeping
into the Downs, who are dead and never saw them."
