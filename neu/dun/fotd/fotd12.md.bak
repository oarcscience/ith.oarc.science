DEATH AND THE ORANGE

Two dark young men in a foreign southern land sat at a restaurant table
with one woman.

And on the woman's plate was a small orange which had an evil laughter
in its heart.

And both of the men would be looking at the woman all the time, and they
ate little and they drank much.

And the woman was smiling equally at each.

Then the small orange that had the laughter in its heart rolled slowly
off the plate on to the floor. And the dark young men both sought for it
at once, and they met suddenly beneath the table, and soon they were
speaking swift words to one another, and a horror and an impotence came
over the Reason of each as she sat helpless at the back of the mind, and
the heart of the orange laughed and the woman went on smiling; and
Death, who was sitting at another table, tête-à-tête with an old man,
rose and came over to listen to the quarrel.
