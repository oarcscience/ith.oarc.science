TIME AND THE TRADESMAN

Once Time as he prowled the world, his hair grey not with weakness but
with dust of the ruin of cities, came to a furniture shop and entered
the Antique department. And there he saw a man darkening the wood of a
chair with dye and beating it with chains and making imitation wormholes
in it.

And when Time saw another doing his work he stood by him awhile and
looked on critically.

And at last he said: "That is not how I work," and he turned the man's
hair white and bent his back and put some furrows in his little cunning
face; then turned and strode away, for a mighty city that was weary and
sick and too long had troubled the fields was sore in need of him.
