THE UNPASTURABLE FIELDS

Thus spake the mountains: "Behold us, even us; the old ones, the grey
ones, that wear the feet of Time. Time on our rocks shall break his
staff and stumble: and still we shall sit majestic, even as now, hearing
the sound of the sea, our old coeval sister, who nurses the bones of her
children and weeps for the things she has done.

"Far, far, we stand above all things; befriending the little cities
until they grow old and leave us to go among the myths.

"We are the most imperishable mountains."

And softly the clouds foregathered from far places, and crag on crag and
mountain upon mountain in the likeness of Caucasus upon Himalaya came
riding past the sunlight upon the backs of storms and looked down idly
from their golden heights upon the crests of the mountains.

"Ye pass away," said the mountains.

And the clouds answered, as I dreamed or fancied,

"We pass away, indeed we pass away, but upon our unpasturable fields
Pegasus prances. Here Pegasus gallops and browses upon song which the
larks bring to him every morning from far terrestrial fields. His
hoof-beats ring upon our slopes at sunrise as though our fields were of
silver. And breathing the dawn-wind in dilated nostrils, with head
tossed upwards and with quivering wings, he stands and stares from our
tremendous heights, and snorts and sees far-future wonderful wars rage
in the creases and the folds of the togas that cover the knees of the
gods."
