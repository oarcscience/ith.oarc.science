THE RETURN OF THE EXILES

The old man with a hammer and the one-eyed man with a spear were seated
by the roadside talking as I came up the hill.

"It isn't as though they hadn't asked us," the one with the hammer said.

"There ain't no more than twenty as knows about it," said the other.

"Twenty's twenty," said the first.

"After all these years," said the one-eyed man with the spear. "After
all these years. We might go back just once."

"O' course we might," said the other.

Their clothes were old even for laborers, the one with the hammer had a
leather apron full of holes and blackened, and their hands looked like
leather. But whatever they were they were English, and this was pleasant
to see after all the motors that had passed me that day with their
burden of mixed and doubtful nationalities.

When they saw me the one with the hammer touched his greasy cap.

"Might we make so bold, sir," he said, "as the ask the way to
Stonehenge?"

"We never ought to go," mumbled the other plaintively. "There's not more
than twenty as knows, but...."

I was bicycling there myself to see the place so I pointed out the way
and rode on at once, for there was something so utterly servile about
them both that I did not care for their company. They seemed by their
wretched mien to have been persecuted or utterly neglected for many
years, I thought that very likely they had done long terms of penal
servitude.

When I came to Stonehenge I saw a group of about a score of men standing
among the stones. They asked me with some solemnity if I was expecting
anyone, and when I said No they spoke to me no more. It was three miles
back where I left those strange old men, but I had not been in the stone
circle long when they appeared, coming with great strides along the
road. When they saw them all the people took off their hats and acted
very strangely, and I saw that they had a goat which they led up then to
the old altar stone. And the two old men came up with their hammer and
spear and began apologizing plaintively for the liberty they had taken
in coming back to that place, and all the people knelt on the grass
before them. And then still kneeling they killed the goat by the altar,
and when the two old men saw this they came up with many excuses and
eagerly sniffed the blood. And at first this made them happy. But soon
the one with the spear began to whimper. "It used to be men," he
lamented. "It used to be men."

And the twenty men began looking uneasily at each other, and the plaint
of the one-eyed man went on in that tearful voice, and all of a sudden
they all looked at me. I do not know who the two old men were or what
any of them were doing, but there are moments when it is clearly time to
go, and I left them there and then. And just as I got up on to my
bicycle I heard the plaintive voice of the one with the hammer
apologizing for the liberty he had taken in coming back to Stonehenge.

"But after all these years," I heard him crying, "After all these
years...."

And the one with the spear said: "Yes, after three thousand years...."
