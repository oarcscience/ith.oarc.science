THE LONELY IDOL

I had from a friend an old outlandish stone, a little swine-faced idol
to whom no one prayed.

And when I saw his melancholy case as he sat cross-legged at receipt of
prayer, holding a little scourge that the years had broken (and no one
heeded the scourge and no one prayed and no one came with squealing
sacrifice; and he had been a god), then I took pity on the little
forgotten thing and prayed to it as perhaps they prayed long since,
before the coming of the strange dark ships, and humbled myself and
said:

"O idol, idol of the hard pale stone, invincible to the years, O
scourge-holder, give ear for behold I pray.

"O little pale-green image whose wanderings are from far, know thou that
here in Europe and in other lands near by, too soon there pass from us
the sweets and song and the lion strength of youth: too soon do their
cheeks fade, their hair grow grey and our beloved die; too brittle is
beauty, too far off is fame and the years are gathered too soon; there
are leaves, leaves falling, everywhere falling; there is autumn among
men, autumn and reaping; failure there is, struggle, dying and weeping,
and all that is beautiful hath not remained but is even as the glory of
morning upon the water.

"Even our memories are gathered too with the sound of the ancient
voices, the pleasant ancient voices that come to our ears no more; the
very gardens of our childhood fade, and there dims with the speed of the
years even the mind's own eye.

"O be not any more the friend of Time, for the silent hurry of his
malevolent feet have trodden down what's fairest; I almost hear the
whimper of the years running behind him hound-like, and it takes few to
tear us.

"All that is beautiful he crushes down as a big man tramples daises, all
that is fairest. How very fair are the little children of men. It is
autumn with all the world, and the stars weep to see it.

"Therefore no longer be the friend of Time, who will not let us be, and
be not good to him but pity us, and let lovely things live on for the
sake of our tears."

Thus prayed I out of compassion one windy day to the snout-faced idol to
whom no one kneeled.
