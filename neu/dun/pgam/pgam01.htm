<p align="center">Preface</p>  
<p>Lest any idle person might think that I have had time to write plays during the last few years I may mention that the first act of <i>The Tents of the Arabs</i> was written on September 3rd, and the second act on September 8th, 1910.</p>  
<p>The first and second acts of <i>The Laughter of the Gods</i> were written on January 29th, and the third act on February 2nd and 3rd, 1911. <i>A Night at an Inn</i> was written on January 17th, 1912, and <i>The Queen's Enemies</i> on April 19, 20, 21, 24, 28, 29, 1913.</p>
