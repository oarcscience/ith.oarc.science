Preface

Lest any idle person might think that I have had time to write plays
during the last few years I may mention that the first act of *The Tents
of the Arabs* was written on September 3rd, and the second act on
September 8th, 1910.

The first and second acts of *The Laughter of the Gods* were written on
January 29th, and the third act on February 2nd and 3rd, 1911. *A Night
at an Inn* was written on January 17th, 1912, and *The Queen's Enemies*
on April 19, 20, 21, 24, 28, 29, 1913.
