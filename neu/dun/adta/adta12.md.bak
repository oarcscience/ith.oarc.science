POOR OLD BILL

On an antique haunt of sailors, a tavern of the sea, the light of day
was fading. For several evenings I had frequented this place, in the
hope of hearing something from the sailors, as they sat over strange
wines, about a rumour that had reached my ears of a certain fleet of
galleons of old Spain still said to be afloat in the South Seas in some
uncharted region.

In this I was again to be disappointed. Talk was low and seldom, and I
was about to leave, when a sailor, wearing ear-rings of pure gold,
lifted up his head from his wine, and looking straight before him at the
wall, told his tale loudly:

(When later on a storm of rain arose and thundered on the tavern's
leaded panes, he raised his voice without effort and spoke on still. The
darker it got the clearer his wild eyes shone.)

"A ship with sails of the olden time was nearing fantastic isles. We had
never seen such isles.

"We all hated the captain, and he hated us. He hated us all alike, there
was no favouritism about him. And he never would talk a word with any of
us, except sometimes in the evening when it was getting dark he would
stop and look up and talk a bit to the men he had hanged at the
yard-arm.

"We were a mutinous crew. But Captain was the only man that had pistols.
He slept with one under his pillow and kept one close beside him. There
was a nasty look about the isles. They were small and flat as though
they had come up only recently from the sea, and they had no sand or
rocks like honest isles, but green grass down to the water. And there
were little cottages there whose looks we did not like. Their thatches
came almost down to the ground, and were strangely turned up at the
corners, and under the low eaves were queer dark windows whose little
leaded panes were too thick to see through. And no one, man or beast,
was walking about, so that you could not know what kind of people lived
there. But Captain knew. And he went ashore and into one of the
cottages, and someone lit lights inside, and the little windows wore an
evil look.

"It was quite dark when he came aboard again, and he bade a cheery
good-night to the men that swung from the yard-arm and he eyed us in a
way that frightened poor old Bill.

"Next night we found that he had learned to curse, for he came on a lot
of us asleep in our bunks, and among them poor old Bill, and he pointed
at us with a finger, and made a curse that our souls should stay all
night at the top of the masts. And suddenly there was the soul of poor
old Bill sitting like a monkey at the top of the mast, and looking at
the stars, and freezing through and through.

"We got up a little mutiny after that, but Captain comes up and points
with his finger again, and this time poor old Bill and all the rest are
swimming behind the ship through the cold green water, though their
bodies remain on deck.

"It was the cabin-boy who found out that Captain couldn't curse when he
was drunk, though he could shoot as well at one time as another.

"After that it was only a matter of waiting, and of losing two men when
the time came. Some of us were murderous fellows, and wanted to kill
Captain, but poor old Bill was for finding a bit of an island, out of
the track of ships, and leaving him there with his share of our year's
provisions. And everybody listened to poor old Bill, and we decided to
maroon Captain as soon as we caught him when he couldn't curse.

"It was three whole days before Captain got drunk again, and poor old
Bill and all had a dreadful time, for Captain invented new curses every
day, and wherever he pointed his finger our souls had to go; and the
fishes got to know us, and so did the stars, and none of them pitied us
when we froze on the masts or were hurried through forests of seaweed
and lost our way—both stars and fishes went about their businesses with
cold, unastonished eyes. Once when the sun had set and it was twilight,
and the moon was showing clearer and clearer in the sky, and we stopped
our work for a moment because Captain seemed to be looking away from us
at the colours in the sky, he suddenly turned and sent our souls to the
Moon. And it was colder there than ice at night; and there were horrible
mountains making shadows; and it was all as silent as miles of tombs;
and Earth was shining up in the sky as big as the blade of a scythe, and
we all got homesick for it, but could not speak nor cry. It was quite
dark when we got back, and we were very respectful to Captain all the
next day, but he cursed several of us again very soon. What we all
feared most was that he would curse our souls to Hell, and none of us
mentioned Hell above a whisper for fear that it should remind him. But
on the third evening the cabin-boy came and told us that Captain was
drunk. And we all went to his cabin, and we found him lying there across
his bunk, and he shot as he had never shot before; but he had no more
than the two pistols, and he would only have killed two men if he hadn't
caught Joe over the head with the end of one of his pistols. And then we
tied him up. And poor old Bill put the rum between the Captain's teeth,
and kept him drunk for two days, so that he could not curse, till we
found a convenient rock. And before sunset of the second day we found a
nice bare island for Captain, out of the track of ships, about a hundred
yards long and about eighty wide; and we rowed him along to it in a
little boat, and gave him provisions for a year, the same as we had
ourselves, because poor old Bill wanted to be fair. And we left him
sitting comfortable with his back to a rock singing a sailor's song.

"When we could no longer hear Captain singing we all grew very cheerful
and made a banquet out of our year's provisions, as we all hoped to be
home again in under three weeks. We had three great banquets every day
for a week—every man had more than he could eat, and what was left over
we threw on the floor like gentlemen. And then one day, as we saw San
Huegedos, and wanted to sail in to spend our money, the wind changed
round from behind us and beat us out to sea. There was no tacking
against it, and no getting into the harbour, though other ships sailed
by us and anchored there. Sometimes a dead calm would fall on us, while
fishing boats all around us flew before half a gale, and sometimes the
wind would beat us out to sea when nothing else was moving. All day we
tried, and at night we laid to and tried again the next day. And all the
sailors of the other ships were spending their money in San Huegedos and
we could not come nigh it. Then we spoke horrible things against the
wind and against San Huegedos, and sailed away.

"It was just the same at Norenna.

"We kept close together now and talked in low voices. Suddenly poor old
Bill grew frightened. As we went all along the Siractic coast-line, we
tried again and again, and the wind was waiting for us in every harbour
and sent us out to sea. Even the little islands would not have us. And
then we knew that there was no landing yet for poor old Bill, and every
one upbraided his kind heart that had made them maroon Captain on a
rock, so as not to have his blood upon their heads. There was nothing to
do but to drift about the seas. There were no banquets now, because we
feared that Captain might live his year and keep us out to sea.

"At first we used to hail all passing ships, and used to try to board
them in the boats; but there was no towing against Captain's curse, and
we had to give that up. So we played cards for a year in Captain's
cabin, night and day, storm and fine, and every one promised to pay poor
old Bill when we got ashore.

"It was horrible to us to think what a frugal man Captain really was, he
that used to get drunk every other day whenever he was at sea, and here
he was still alive, and sober too, for his curse still kept us out of
every port, and our provisions were gone.

"Well, it came to drawing lots, and Jim was the unlucky one. Jim only
kept us about three days, and then we drew lots again, and this time it
was the nigger. The nigger didn't keep us any longer, and we drew again,
and this time it was Charlie, and still Captain was alive.

"As we got fewer one of us kept us longer. Longer and longer a mate used
to last us, and we all wondered how ever Captain did it. It was five
weeks over the year when we drew Mike, and he kept us for a week, and
Captain was still alive. We wondered he didn't get tired of the same old
curse; but we supposed things looked different when one is alone on an
island.  "When there was only Jakes and poor old Bill and the cabin-boy
and Dick, we didn't draw any longer. We said that the cabin-boy had had
all the luck, and he mustn't expect any more. Then poor old Bill was
alone with Jakes and Dick, and Captain was still alive. When there was
no more boy, and the Captain still alive, Dick, who was a huge strong
man like poor old Bill, said that it was Jakes' turn, and he was very
lucky to have lived as long as he had. But poor old Bill talked it all
over with Jakes, and they thought it better than Dick should take his
turn.

"Then there was Jakes and poor old Bill; and Captain would not die.

"And these two used to watch one another night and day, when Dick was
gone and no one else was left to them. And at last poor old Bill fell
down in a faint and lay there for an hour. Then Jakes came up to him
slowly with his knife, and makes a stab at poor old Bill as he lies
there on the deck. And poor old Bill caught hold of him by the wrist,
and put his knife into him twice to make quite sure, although it spoiled
the best part of the meat. Then poor old Bill was all alone at sea.

"And the very next week, before the food gave out, Captain must have
died on his bit of an island; for poor old Bill heard the Captain's soul
going cursing over the sea, and the day after that the ship was cast on
a rocky coast.

"And Captain's been dead now for over a hundred years, and poor old Bill
is safe ashore again. But it looks as if Captain hadn't done with him
yet, for poor old Bill doesn't ever get any older, and somehow or other
he doesn't seem to die. Poor old Bill!"

When this was over the man's fascination suddenly snapped, and we all
jumped up and left him.

It was not only his revolting story, but it was the fearful look in the
eyes of the man who told it, and the terrible ease with which his voice
surpassed the roar of the rain, that decided me never again to enter
that haunt of sailors—the tavern of the sea.
