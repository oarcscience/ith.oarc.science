The Bad Old Woman in Black

The bad old woman in black ran down the street of the ox-butchers.

Windows at once were opened high up in those crazy gables; heads were
thrust out: it was she. Then there arose the counsel of anxious voices,
calling sideways from window to window or across to opposite houses. Why
was she there with her sequins and bugles and old black gown? Why had
she left her dreaded house? On what fell errand she hasted?

They watched her lean, lithe figure, and the wind in that old black
dress, and soon she was gone from the cobbled street and under the
town's high gateway. She turned at once to her right and was hid from
the view of the houses. Then they all ran down to their doors, and small
groups formed on the pavement; there they took counsel together, the
eldest speaking first. Of what they had seen they said nothing, for
there was no doubt it was she; it was of the future they spoke, and the
future only.

In what notorious thing would her errand end? What gains had tempted her
out from her fearful home? What brilliant but sinful scheme had her
genius planned? Above all, what future evil did this portend? Thus at
first it was only questions. And then the old grey-beards spoke, each
one to a little group; they had seen her out before, had known her when
she was younger, and had noted the evil things that had followed her
goings: the small groups listened well to their low and earnest voices.
No one asked questions now or guessed at her infamous errand, but
listened only to the wise old men who knew the things that had been, and
who told the younger men of the dooms that had come before.

Nobody knew how many times she had left her dreaded house; but the
oldest recounted all the times that they knew, and the way she had gone
each time, and the doom that had followed her going; and two could
remember the earthquake that there was in the street of the shearers.

So were there many tales of the times that were, told on the pavement
near the old green doors by the edge of the cobbled street, and the
experience that the aged men had bought with their white hairs might be
had cheap by the young. But from all their experience only this was
clear, that never twice in their lives had she done the same infamous
thing, and that the same calamity twice had never followed her goings.
Therefore it seemed that means were doubtful and few for finding out
what thing was about to befall; and an ominous feeling of gloom came
down on the street of the ox-butchers. And in the gloom grew fears of
the very worst. This comfort they only had when they put their fear into
words—that the doom that followed her goings had never yet been
anticipated. One feared that with magic she meant to move the moon; and
he would have dammed the high tide on the neighbouring coast, knowing
that as the moon attracted the sea the sea must attract the moon, and
hoping by his device to humble her spells. Another would have fetched
iron bars and clamped them across the street, remembering the earthquake
there was in the street of the shearers. Another would have honoured his
household gods, the little cat-faced idols seated above his hearth, gods
to whom magic was no unusual thing, and, having paid their fees and
honoured them well, would have put the whole case before them. His
scheme found favour with many, and yet at last was rejected, for others
ran indoors and brought out their gods, too, to be honoured, till there
was a herd of gods all seated there on the pavement; yet would they have
honoured them and put their case before them but that a fat man ran up
last of all, carefully holding under a reverent arm his own two
hound-faced gods, though he knew well—as, indeed, all men must—that they
were notoriously at war with the little cat-faced idols. And although
the animosities natural to faith had all been lulled by the crisis, yet
a look of anger had come into the cat-like faces that no one dared
disregard, and all perceived that if they stayed a moment longer there
would be flaming around them the jealousy of the gods; so each man
hastily took his idols home, leaving the fat man insisting that his
hound-faced gods should be honoured.

Then there were schemes again and voices raised in debate, and many new
dangers feared and new plans made.

But in the end they made no defence against danger, for they knew not
what it would be, but wrote upon parchment as a warning, and in order
that all might know: "*The bad old woman in black ran down the street of
the ox-butchers*."
