Preface

Ebrington Barracks

Aug. 16th 1916.

I do not know where I may be when this preface is read. As I write it in
August 1916, I am at Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry, recovering from a
slight wound. But it does not greatly matter where I am; my dreams are
here before you amongst the following pages; and writing in a day when
life is cheap, dreams seem to me all the dearer, the only things that
survive.

Just now the civilization of Europe seems almost to have ceased, and
nothing seems to grow in her torn fields but death, yet this is only for
a while and dreams will come back again and bloom as of old, all the
more radiantly for this terrible ploughing, as the flowers will bloom
again where the trenches are and the primroses shelter in shell-holes
for many seasons, when weeping Liberty has come home to Flanders.

To some of you in America this may seem an unnecessary and wasteful
quarrel, as other people's quarrels often are; but it comes to this that
though we are all killed there will be songs again, but if we were to
submit and so survive there could be neither songs nor dreams, nor any
joyous free things any more.

And do not regret the lives that are wasted amongst us, or the work that
the dead would have done, for war is no accident that man's care could
have averted, but is as natural, though not as regular, as the tides; as
well regret the things that the tide has washed away, which destroys and
cleanses and crumbles, and spares the minutest shells.

And now I will write nothing further about our war, but offer you these
books of dreams from Europe as one throws things of value, if only to
oneself, at the last moment out of a burning house.

DUNSANY.
