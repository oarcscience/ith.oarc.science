The Bird of the Difficult Eye

Observant men and women that know their Bond Street well will appreciate
my astonishment when in a jewellers' shop I perceived that nobody was
furtively watching me. Not only this but when I even picked up a little
carved crystal to examine it no shop-assistants crowded round me. I
walked the whole length of the shop, still no one politely followed.

Seeing from this that some extraordinary revolution had occurred in the
jewelry business I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer old
person half demon and half man who has an idol-shop in a byway of the
City and who keeps me informed of affairs at the Edge of the World. And
briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by way of snuff he
gave me this tremendous information: that Mr. Neepy Thang the son of
Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World and was even now in
London.

The information may not appear tremendous to those unacquainted with the
source of jewelry; but when I say that the only thief employed by any
West-end jeweller since famous Thangobrind's distressing doom is this
same Neepy Thang, and that for lightness of fingers and swiftness of
stockinged foot they have none better in Paris, it will be understood
why the Bond Street jewellers no longer cared what became of their old
stock.

There were big diamonds in London that summer and a few considerable
sapphires. In certain astounding kingdoms behind the East strange
sovereigns missed from their turbans the heirlooms of ancient wars, and
here and there the keepers of crown jewels who had not heard the
stockinged feet of Thang, were questioned and died slowly.

And the jewellers gave a little dinner to Thang at the Hotel Great
Magnificent; the windows had not been opened for five years and there
was wine at a guinea a bottle that you could not tell from champagne and
cigars at half a crown with a Havana label. Altogether it was a splendid
evening for Thang.

But I have to tell of a far sadder thing than a dinner at a hotel. The
public require jewelry and jewelry must be obtained. I have to tell of
Neepy Thang's last journey.

That year the fashion was emeralds. A man named Green had recently
crossed the Channel on a bicycle and the jewellers said that a green
stone would be particularly appropriate to commemorate the event and
recommended emeralds.

Now a certain money-lender of Cheapside who had just been made a peer
had divided his gains into three equal parts; one for the purchase of
the peerage, country house and park, and the twenty thousand pheasants
that are absolutely essential, and one for the upkeep of the position,
while the third he banked abroad, partly to cheat the native
tax-gatherer and partly because it seemed to him that the days of the
Peerage were few and that he might at any moment be called upon to start
afresh elsewhere. In the upkeep of the position he included jewelry for
his wife and so it came about that Lord Castlenorman placed an order
with two well-known Bond-street jewellers named Messrs. Grosvenor and
Campbell to the extent of £100,000 for a few reliable emeralds.

But the emeralds in stock were mostly small and shop-soiled and Neepy
Thang had to set out at once before he had had as much as a week in
London. I will briefly sketch his project. Not many knew it, for where
the form of business is blackmail the fewer creditors you have the
better (which of course in various degrees applies at all times).

On the shores of the risky seas of Shiroora Shan grows one tree only so
that upon its branches if anywhere in the world there must build its
nest the Bird of the Difficult Eye. Neepy Thang had come by this
information, which was indeed the truth, that if the bird migrated to
Fairyland before the three eggs hatched out they would undoubtedly all
turn into emeralds, while if they hatched out first it would be a bad
business.

When he had mentioned these eggs to Messrs. Grosvenor and Campbell they
had said, "The very thing": they were men of few words, in English, for
it was not their native tongue.

So Neepy Thang set out. He bought the purple ticket at Victoria Station.
He went by Herne Hill, Bromley and Bickley and passed St. Mary Cray. At
Eynsford he changed and taking a footpath along a winding valley went
wandering into the hills. And at the top of a hill in a little wood,
where all the anemones long since were over and the perfume of mint and
thyme from outside came drifting in with Thang, he found once more the
familiar path, age-old and fair as wonder, that leads to the Edge of the
World. Little to him were its sacred memories that are one with the
secret of earth, for he was on business, and little would they be to me
if I ever put them on paper. Let it suffice that he went down that path
going further and further from the fields we know, and all the way he
muttered to himself, "What if the eggs hatch out and it be a bad
business!" The glamour that is at all times upon those lonely lands that
lie at the back of the chalky hills of Kent intensified as he went upon
his journeys. Queerer and queerer grew the things that he saw by little
World-End Path. Many a twilight descended upon that journey with all
their mysteries, many a blaze of stars; many a morning came flaming up
to a tinkle of silvern horns; till the outpost elves of Fairyland came
in sight and the glittering crests of Fairyland's three mountains
betokened the journey's end. And so with painful steps (for the shores
of the world are covered with huge crystals) he came to the risky seas
of Shiroora Shan and saw them pounding to gravel the wreckage of fallen
stars, saw them and heard their roar, those shipless seas that between
earth and the fairies' homes heave beneath some huge wind that is none
of our four. And there in the darkness on the grizzly coast, for
darkness was swooping slantwise down the sky as though with some evil
purpose, there stood that lonely, gnarled and deciduous tree. It was a
bad place to be found in after dark, and night descended with multitudes
of stars, beasts prowling in the blackness gluttered \[See any
dictionary, but in vain.\] at Neepy Thang. And there on a lower branch
within easy reach he clearly saw the Bird of the Difficult Eye sitting
upon the nest for which she is famous. Her face was towards those three
inscrutable mountains, far-off on the other side of the risky seas,
whose hidden valleys are Fairyland. Though not yet autumn in the fields
we know, it was close on midwinter here, the moment as Thang knew when
those eggs hatch out. Had he miscalculated and arrived a minute too
late? Yet the bird was even now about to migrate, her pinions fluttered
and her gaze was toward Fairyland. Thang hoped and muttered a prayer to
those pagan gods whose spite and vengeance he had most reason to fear.
It seems that it was too late or a prayer too small to placate them, for
there and then the stroke of midwinter came and the eggs hatched out in
the roar of Shiroora Shan or ever the bird was gone with her difficult
eye and it was a bad business indeed for Neepy Thang; I haven't the
heart to tell you any more.

"'Ere," said Lord Castlenorman some few weeks later to Messrs. Grosvenor
and Campbell, "you aren't 'arf taking your time about those emeralds."
