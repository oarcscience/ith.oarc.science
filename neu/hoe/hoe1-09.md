## CANTO IV <span class="small">THE ISLAND MAIDEN</span>

W<span class="small">HEN</span> the Kalevide had satisfied himself that
no further traces of his mother were to be found, he cast himself into
the sea beneath the stars, and swam northwards manfully towards Finland,
swimming with his hands, steering with his feet, and with his hair
floating like a sail. He swam on till past midnight without meeting with
a resting-place; but at length he espied a black speck in the distance,
which proved to be a small rocky island. The hero discovered a mossy
bank on a projecting rock, and made his way to the shore, and lay down,
intending to sleep a little, when he was roused by the voice of a maiden
singing a love-song. It was very dark and somewhat foggy, but he saw the
light of a fire at a little distance at the foot of an oak-tree, beneath
which sat a fair girl with brown eyes.<span
id="page_32_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_32_note_1.md) The hero soon joined <span
id="page_33">p. 33</span> her, and they talked together for some time,
when the maiden became alarmed at his familiarities, and cried out. Her
mother awoke, and thought it was only a bad dream; but her father
hastened to her aid, armed with a great club. But when he saw the
terrible giant, he grew as pale as death, and his club dropped from his
hand.

 The maiden could not lift her eyes to her father, but the Kalevide
asked carelessly if he had seen the Finnish sorcerer pass the island in
his boat on the previous evening. “No,” replied the islander, “I have
not seen anything of him for weeks; but tell me your name and lineage,
for I judge that you are of the race of the gods.” The hero answered him
fully; but when the maiden heard that he was the son of Kalev and Linda,
she was seized with terror, and her foot slipping she fell from the
cliff into the sea.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

 The father shrieked and wrung his hands, but the Kalevide plunged into
the sea after the maiden, and sought for her for a long time in vain.
When he abandoned the search, he did not venture to return to the
island, but after crying out a few words of unavailing regret swam again
towards Finland. The father’s cry of despair fully roused the mother,
who sprang up, and ran down to the shore, only to learn that her
daughter was lost.

 Then the mother took a rake with a long copper handle, and the father
took his net, and with them they sought for their daughter’s body at the
bottom of the sea.<span id="page_34_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_34_note_1.md)
They did not find their daughter, but they raked up an oak-tree, a
fir-tree, an eagle’s egg, an iron helmet, a fish, and a silver dish.
They took them all carefully home, and went again to seek for their lost
child.

 Then a song arose from the deep, telling how a maiden went down to the
sea:<span id="page_34_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_34_note_2.md)

 Then the man of copper offered her the weapons if she would take him as
her husband, but she refused, saying that she was the daughter of a
landsman, and preferred a husband from the village on the land. He
laughed scornfully; her foot slipped, and she sank into the sea. Her
father and mother came to seek her, and found only her ornaments
scattered on the beach. They called her by her name, and implored her to
go home with them; but she answered that she could not, <span
id="page_37">p. 37</span> for she was weighed down by the water; and she
related to them her adventure with the copper man. But she begged her
parents not to weep for her, for she had a house at the bottom of the
sea, and a soft resting-place in the ooze.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_32">p. 32</span>

<span id="page_32_note_1"></span>[1](#page_32_fr_1.md) The story in the
*Kalevipoeg* is very confused, but this maiden <span
id="footnotes_page_33">p. 33</span> evidently corresponds to the lost
sister of Kullervo (*Kalevala*, Runo 35), whom he meets casually, and
seduces. When they discover the truth, the girl throws herself into a
torrent. In the *Kalevipoeg*, Canto 7, the Kalevide and the maiden are
actually spoken of as brother and sister. There are many versions of
this story; in one of them (Neus, *Ehstnische Volkslieder*, pp. 5-8;
Latham’s *Nationalities of Europe*, i. p. 138), the maiden is
represented as slaying her brother, who is called indifferently the son
of Kalev or of Sullev, to the great satisfaction of her father and
mother.

<span id="footnotes_page_34">p. 34</span>

<span id="page_34_note_1"></span>[1](#page_34_fr_1.md) In the *Kalevala*,
Runo 15, Lemminkainen’s mother collects together the fragments of his
body from the River of Death with a long rake.

<span id="page_34_note_2"></span>[2](#page_34_fr_2.md) This song and story
(except for the incident of the man of copper) resembles that of the
drowning of Aino in the *Kalevala*, Runo 4.

<span id="footnotes_page_35">p. 35</span>

<span id="page_35_note_1"></span>[1](#page_35_fr_1.md) It was a copper man
who rose from the water to fell the great oak-tree (*Kalevala*, Runo 2).
Compare also the variant in Canto 6 of the *Kalevipoeg*. We may also
remember the copper men connected with the mountain of loadstone
(*Thousand and One Nights*, Third Calendar’s Story).

<span id="page_35_note_2"></span>[2](#page_35_fr_2.md) Literally a
“house-hen;” one of those idiomatic terms of endearment which cannot be
reproduced in another language.
