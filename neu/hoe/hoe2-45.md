# SECTION VII

### *LAKE LEGENDS.*

A<span class="small">LTHOUGH</span> Esthonia is not so distinctly a
lake-country as Finland,<span
id="page_135_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_135_note_1) which is often called
“The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes,” yet it is a low swampy country, with
many small lakes besides the great Lake Peipus, on the south-east, and
lake stories of various kinds are numerous in Esthonian tales.

 Jannsen relates that Lake Korküll or Oiso, in the district of Fellin in
Livonia, stands on the site of a castle, the lord of which insisted on
marrying his sister. He bribed a priest to perform the ceremony, but the
castle sank into the ground with all present, and a lake arose in its
stead.

 We add a selection of Esthonian lake-stories.
