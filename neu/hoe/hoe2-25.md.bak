## HOW THE SEA BECAME SALT. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

T<span class="small">HIS</span> is an interesting variant of a story
known from Iceland to Finland.

 There were two brothers, one rich and one poor. One Christmas the rich
brother gave the other a ham, on condition that he should go to Pōrgu.
On his way, he met an old man who told him that ham was a rarity there,
but he must not sell it for money, but only for what was behind the
door, which proved to be a wishing-mill. The rich brother bought it for
a high price, and set it to grind herrings and milk-soup; but he was
soon forced to give his brother another great sum to induce him to take
it back, and to save him and his wife, and indeed the whole village,
from being overwhelmed by the torrents of herrings and soup. Afterwards
it was sold to a sea-captain, who set it to grind salt, and it ground on
till the ship sank, and it now lies at the bottom of the sea, grinding
salt for ever.<span id="page_70_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_70_note_*.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_70">p. 70</span>

<span id="page_70_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_70_fr_*.md) It will be
remembered that the Sampo, the magic mill in the *Kalevala*, <span
id="footnotes_page_71">p. 71</span> ground salt as well as corn and
money, and was ultimately broken to pieces and sunk in the sea. The
Grôtta-Söngr in the Edda of Sæmund is better known; and many other
variants might be cited. The story in the text much resembles that of
“Silly Nicholas,” which I remember reading in one of Chambers’s
publications many years ago.
