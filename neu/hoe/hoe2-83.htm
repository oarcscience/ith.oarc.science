On the west wind&#8217;s path of copper,<BR> On the pathway of the rainbow,<BR> Swift I hastened on as envoy,<BR> With the king&#8217;s note in my wallet,<BR> And his mandate in my bosom,<BR> And upon my tongue the secret<BR> And the leader&#8217;s secret orders<BR> That the flags should now be waving,<BR> And the spear-points should be sharpened,<BR> What was it I there encountered,<BR> And what met me there to vex me?<BR> &#8217;&#8201;Twas the raven&#8217;s son that met me,<BR> &#8217;&#8201;Twas a carrion-bird that met me;<BR> With his beak he sniffed around him,<BR> And his nostrils snuffed the vapour,<BR> That the meaning of my message<BR> With his nose he thus might fathom.<BR> He had smelt the war already,<BR> And the scent of blood had reached him,<BR> And he went to call his comrades.<BR> &#8195;To the Finnish Bridge when driving<BR> On the west wind&#8217;s path of copper,<BR> On the pathway of the rainbow,<BR> While I hastened as an envoy,<BR> With the king&#8217;s note in my wallet,<BR> And his mandate in my bosom,<BR> And upon my tongue the secret,<BR> And the leader&#8217;s secret orders,<BR> What was that which came to meet me,<BR> And what horror to confound me?<BR> &#8217;&#8201;Twas a little wolf that met me,<BR>

And a bear that followed closely;<BR> With their snouts they sniffed around them,<BR> Through the mist they pushed their nostrils,<BR> Seeking thus to probe the secret,<BR> And the letter to discover;<BR> They had smelt the war already,<BR> And the scent of blood had reached them,<BR> And they ran to spread the tidings.<BR> &#8195;To the Finnish Bridge when driving<BR> On the west wind&#8217;s path of copper,<BR> On the pathway of the rainbow,<BR> While I hastened as an envoy,<BR> With the king&#8217;s note in my wallet,<BR> And his mandate in my bosom,<BR> And upon my tongue defiance,<BR> With the leader&#8217;s secret orders<BR> That the flags unfurled should flutter,<BR> And the spear-points do their duty,<BR> And the axes should be lifted,<BR> And the swords should flash in sunlight,<BR> What was that which came to meet me,<BR> And what horror to confound me?<BR> It was Famine met me tottering,<BR> Tottering Famine, chewing garbage;<BR> With her nose she sniffed around her,<BR> That the meaning of my message<BR> With her nose she thus might fathom;<BR> For she smelt the war already,<BR> And the scent of blood had reached her,<BR> And she went to call her comrades.<BR> &#8195;To the Finnish Bridge while driving<BR>

On the west wind&#8217;s path of copper,<BR> On the pathway of the rainbow,<BR> While I hastened as an envoy,<BR> With the king&#8217;s note in my wallet,<BR> And his mandate in my bosom,<BR> On my tongue the secret orders<BR> That the flags unfurled should flutter,<BR> And the spear-points do their duty,<BR> And the axes and the fish-spears<BR> All should do the work before them,<BR> What was that which came to meet me,<BR> What unlooked-for horror met me?<BR> &#8217;&#8201;Twas the Plague I there encountered,<BR> Crafty Plague, the people&#8217;s murderer,<BR> Of the sevenfold war-plagues direst;<BR> With his nose he sniffed around him,<BR> And his nostrils snuffed the vapour,<BR> Seeking thus to probe the matter,<BR> And the letter to discover;<BR> He had smelt the war already,<BR> And the scent of blood had lured him<BR> And he went to call his comrades.<BR> &#8195;After this my horse I halted,<BR> Yoked him with a yoke of iron,<BR> Fettered him with Kalev&#8217;s fetters,<BR> That he stood as rooted firmly,<BR> From the spot to move unable,<BR> While I pondered and considered,<BR> Deeply in my heart reflecting<BR> If the profit of my journey<BR> Were not lost in greater evil<BR>

For the war brings wounds and bloodshed,<BR> And the war has throat of serpent.<BR> Wherefore then should I the battle,<BR> Whence springs only pain and murder,<BR> Forth to peaceful homesteads carry?<BR> Let a message so accursed<BR> In the ocean-depths be sunken,<BR> There to sleep in endless slumber,<BR> Lost among the spawn of fishes,<BR> There to rest in deepest caverns,<BR> Rather than that I should take it,<BR> Till it spreads among the hamlets.<BR> Thereupon I took the mandate<BR> Which I carried in my wallet,<BR> And amid the depths I sunk it,<BR> Underneath the waves of ocean,<BR> Till the waves to foam had torn it,<BR> And to mud had quite reduced it,<BR> While the fishes fled before it.<BR> Thus was hushed the sound of warfare,<BR> Thus was lost the news of battle.<BR></SMALL></TD></TR>
