## THE WONDERFUL HAYCOCK. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

O<span class="small">NE</span> autumn evening a girl was going home
across a frozen heath, but though she walked fast, she shivered.
Presently she was pestered by a moving <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>
haycock without a band, which pressed upon her so closely that the hay
pricked her face. This continued till midnight; but when a cock crew in
the village, the haycock vanished, and the girl made her way home
exhausted, and died within a week. Since then, the people say that cries
for help have been heard from the heath by night. But they are very
particular that every haycock shall be tied with a band. If thus
secured, no evil spirit can interfere with it.
