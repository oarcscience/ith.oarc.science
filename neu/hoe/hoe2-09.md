## THE IDIOT’S LUCK.

W<span class="small">E</span> find this form of the story of the
despised younger son in the “Strange Tale of an Ox” (Kreutzwald). A
dying father leaves an ox to his third son, a simpleton, who goes to
sell it, and when passing through a wood he hears a noise in a tree, and
thinks it is an offer to buy the ox; so he ties it to the tree, and
takes a log home with him as security for the money. Not receiving it
when he expected, he breaks open the log, and finds a jar of money
inside. He afterwards kills a shepherd who tries to cheat him out of it;
and it is given out that the shepherd has been carried away by the
devil.
