### *BEAST-STORIES*

I <span class="small">COMMENCE</span> with wolf-stories, which are
rather numerous in Esthonia. One of them relates the creation of the
wolf. When God had created the world, he asked the Devil what he thought
of his work; and the Devil objected that there was no animal to scare
away mischievous boys from the woods when the bear and the snake were
sunk in their winter sleep. Thereupon God gave leave to the Devil to
make such an animal as he wished, and to give it life by the formula,
“Stand up and devour the Devil.” Then the Devil made the wolf’s back of
a strong hedge-pole, the head of a tree-stump, the breast of twigs and
leather, and the loins of bricks.<span
id="page_274_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_274_note_1.md) He made the tail of a
fern-frond, and the feet of alder-stumps, but he put a stone into its
breast for the heart. He clothed the body with <span id="page_275">p.
275</span> moss, burning coals formed the eyes, and iron nails were used
for the teeth and claws. He then named the creature Wolf, and pronounced
the spell as far as “devour,” when the creature raised his head and
snorted. The Devil was too much frightened to finish, but afterwards
plucked up courage, and repeated the spell, substituting God’s name for
his own. But the wolf took no notice, and when the Devil appealed to
God, he was only told to use the same spell; so he stood a long way off
and pronounced it. Then the wolf rushed at the Devil, who was forced to
hide under a stone to save himself. Since then the wolf has been the
Devil’s worst enemy, and pursues him everywhere.

 Another story relates how God forbade the wolf to eat the flocks and
the dogs, but to receive his share when the farmers baked. But one day a
farmer’s wife threw the wolf a red-hot stone instead of bread, and he
burnt his muzzle, which has been black ever since. Since then he devours
whatever falls in his way.

 A farmer, hemmed in by a herd of wolves, succeeded in driving them
away, but was followed home by one of them. When he took his provisions
out of the sledge, he laid his hand on a square object like a <span
id="page_276">p. 276</span> whetstone. He then remembered hearing that
the wolves sometimes receive food from heaven, and thought this might be
their portion. So he flung it to the wolf, saying, “Take it if it’s
yours;” and the wolf seized it and disappeared.

 There is an odd story of a young woman who was carrying an apron full
of eggs to her mother. She was overtaken by a violent thunderstorm, and
sheltered under a fir-tree. She felt something moving among the eggs,
and was frightened; but presently she was still more terrified when she
found a great wolf tugging at her apron. She dropped it in her fright,
and a black cat jumped out and darted away, pursued by the wolf. When
she reached the village, her mother told her that the black cat was the
Devil, who had taken that form in order to play her a trick or do her
some injury, but had been scared away by the wolf.

 Have we here an inverted and distorted echo of “Little Red Riding
Hood?”

 A peasant who was broiling fish in the forest at nightfall met with a
still more alarming adventure. A black man appeared to him, and
commanded him to fetch him a spit, for he wanted to broil fish too. But
the spit which he wanted was a long sharp <span id="page_277">p.
277</span> stake, and the peasant himself was to be the fish. In his
terror the peasant called “St. George’s Dogs” to his aid, and a pack of
wolves rushed out, and chased the Devil away, while the peasant drew out
the axle from his cart-wheel, and supplied its place with a pole of
rowan-wood.

 Another story relates how an unfortunate wolf missed getting his usual
rations from God, and set out to forage for himself. After sparing some
whom he met, and allowing others to escape, he fell into the hands of a
young peasant, who gave him a sound beating and then took refuge in a
tree. The wolf’s relatives, seeking revenge, climbed on each other’s
back till they nearly reached the peasant, who upset them by a
stratagem, and they fell, many breaking their limbs. Since then a wolf
always runs away when he sees a man.

 Were-wolves are sometimes alluded to in Esthonian tales.

 

 The following stories are of a more miscellaneous character, and some
of them are sufficiently interesting to be given with little or no
abridgment.

<span id="page_274_note_1"></span>[1](#page_274_fr_1.md) Such origins are
common in Esthonian and Finnish folk-literature, and I regard them as
relics of fetishism.
