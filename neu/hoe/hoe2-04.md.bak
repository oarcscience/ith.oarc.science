## CINDERELLA. (K<span class="small">REUTZWALD.</span>)

T<span class="small">HE</span> Esthonian story of Tuhka-Triinu
(Ash-Katie<span id="page_4_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_4_note_1).md), as given
by Kreutzwald, is more on the lines of the German *Aschenputtel* than on
those of the French *Cendrillon*.

 Once upon a time there lived a rich man with his wife and an only
daughter. When the mother dies, she directs her daughter to plant a tree
on her grave, where the birds can find food and shelter.<span
id="page_4_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_4_note_2.md) The father marries a widow
with two daughters, who ill-treat the motherless girl, declaring that
she shall be their slave-girl. A magpie cries from the summit of the
tree, “Poor child, poor child! why do you not go and complain to the
rowan-tree? Ask for counsel, when your hard life will be lightened.”

 She goes to the grave at night, and a voice asks <span id="page_5">p.
5</span> her to whom she should appeal, and in whom she should trust,
and she answers, “God.” Then the voice tells her to call the cock and
hen to help her, when she has work to do which she cannot perform by
herself.

 When the king’s ball is announced, Cinderella has to dress her sisters,
after which the eldest throws lentils into the ashes, telling her to
pick them up; but this is done by the cock and hen. She is left at home
weeping, and a voice tells her to go and shake the rowan-tree. When she
had done so, a light appeared in the darkness, and she saw a woman
sitting on the summit of the tree. She was an ell high, and clothed in
golden raiment, and she held a small basket and a gold wand in her
hands. She took a hen’s egg from her basket, which she turned into a
coach; six mice formed the horses, a black beetle<span
id="page_5_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_5_note_1.md) formed the coachman, and two
speckled butterflies the footmen.

 The little witch-maiden then dressed Tuhka Triinu as magnificently as a
Saxon lady. She then sent her to the ball, warning her to leave before
the cock crows for the third time, as everything will then resume its
original shape. On the second <span id="page_6">p. 6</span> night Tuhka
Triinu took to flight, and lost one of her little gold shoes, which the
prince found next morning. When it came to be tried on, Tuhka Triinu’s
sisters, who thought they had small feet, tugged and squeezed without
success. But the shoe fitted Tuhka Triinu. Her guardian again robed her
magnificently, and she married the prince.<span

<span id="page_4_note_1"></span>[1](#page_4_fr_1.md) Here Cinderella’s real
name is Katrina; in Finnish she is sometimes called Kristina (see Miss
Cox, *Cinderella*, p. 552), while in Slavonic tales she is called Marya,
and in some German adaptations Aennchen.

<span id="page_4_note_2"></span>[2](#page_4_fr_2.md) When Väinämöinen
cleared the forest, he left a birch-tree standing for the same purpose
(*Kalevala*, Runo ii.).

<span id="footnotes_page_5">p. 5</span>

<span id="page_5_note_1"></span>[1](#page_5_fr_1.md) A black dung-beetle
(*Geotrupes*) is meant, not a cockroach.

<span id="footnotes_page_6">p. 6</span>

<span id="page_6_note_1"></span>[1](#page_6_fr_1.md) This story is one of
