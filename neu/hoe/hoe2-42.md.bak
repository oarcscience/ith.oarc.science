### *HEATH LEGENDS.* (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

J<span class="small">ANNSEN</span> gives the following account of
heath-spirits, &c. Abstracts of stories not included under other
headings we have appended to his general observations.

 In former days, when trees and bushes talked, animals and birds
understood a wonderful language, and the Old Boy wandered about openly
and unabashed, and wonderful things often happened on the heaths. He who
wished to cross a heath must keep his eyes open day and night. In the
daytime, indeed, no spectre dared to appear; but it often happened at
night that people were teased and frightened on the heath. If any one
was on the heath on a summer or autumn evening, he often heard a
rustling and tapping in the bushes, and perhaps water suddenly spurted
out under his feet. On winter evenings, or at midnight, he saw <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> little flames dancing on the moor, and if he
went towards them, they disappeared suddenly, and danced up again in the
distance. But if a man was on the moor at night-time, he could not
escape from it till cockcrow. If a man had to fetch anything from the
heath during hay-harvest, he heard strange voices, or heard a bird
singing with a human voice; and whoever drove across the moor in winter
with a light sledge must have heard an invisible hand striking against
the tree-trunks or the ice. Then you whip up your horse, and hasten
across the moor, if you can.

 Jannsen also relates a story of a herd-boy who was scolding at some
girls who were gathering berries on the heath, and defying the devil;
when he was suddenly seized by the feet and dragged down into the
ground, crying for help.
