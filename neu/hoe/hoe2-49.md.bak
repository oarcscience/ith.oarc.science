## THE BLUE SPRING. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

A<span class="small">T</span> the foot of the Villina hill, near the
church of Lais,<span id="page_145_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_145_note_1.md) is
a swamp where rises a spring of water, called from its colour the Blue
Spring. It is said that the spring can produce rain or drought, and thus
cause dearth or plenty. In time of drought three widows of the same name
must go to the spring on a Sunday during service-time, to clean it out
and to enlarge the opening. Each must take a spade, hoe, rake, a cake of
bread, and a hymn-book with her. But if too much rain falls, the spring
must be closed up to a mere crevice, and this is at once efficacious.

 One day three widows named Anna opened the spring too wide, when a
dreadful rain spread over the country. Sometimes it has happened that
women who were about to clean the spring have failed to finish the work
during church-time, and it has been fruitless. Another time the people
wished <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> to find out how deep was the
spring. They let down a stone with a long cord, but drew the cord up
without the stone. They then let down a kettle filled with stones, but,
to their horror, they drew up a bleeding human head instead. They were
about to make another trial, when a voice cried from the depths, “If you
attempt this again, you will all sink!” So the depth of the Blue Spring
is still unknown.
