 The next story, which belongs to the same class as Grimm’s “Devil with
the Three Golden Hairs,” introduces us to the personified Frost, who is
here a much less malevolent being than in the *Kalevala*, Runo xxx. It
also combines two familiar classes of tales: those in which a man
receives gifts which are stolen from him, and which he afterwards
recovers by means of another, often a magic cudgel; and those in which a
man visiting the house of a giant or devil in his absence is concealed
by the old mother in order to listen to the secrets revealed by her son
when he comes home.

 

## THE TWO BROTHERS AND THE FROST. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

O<span class="small">NCE</span> upon a time there were two brothers, one
of whom was rich and the other poor. The rich brother had much cornland
and many cattle, but the poor one had only a little corner of a field,
in which <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> he sowed rye. Then came the
Frost and destroyed even this poor crop. Nothing was left to the poor
brother, so he set out in search of the Frost. When he had gone some
distance, he arrived at a small house and went in. He found an old woman
sitting there, who asked what he wanted. The man answered, “I had tilled
a small field, and the Frost came and took away even the littie that I
had. So I set out in search of him, to ask why he has done me this
mischief.” The old woman answered, “The Frosts are my sons, and they
destroy everything; but just now they are not at home. If they came home
and found you here, they would destroy you likewise. Get up on the
stove, and wait there.” The man crept up, and just then the Frost came
in. “Son,” said the old woman, “why did you spoil the field of a poor
man who was sufficiently pinched without this?” “Oh,” said the Frost, “I
was only trying whether my cold would bite.” Then said the poor man on
the stove, “Only give me so much back that I can just scrape through, or
I must soon die of hunger, for I have nothing to break and bite.” The
Frost said, “We will give him enough to last him all his life.” Then he
gave him a knapsack, saying, “When you are hungry, you have only to
<span id="page_73">p. 73</span> say, ‘Open, sack,’ and you will have
food and drink in abundance. But when you have had enough, say, ‘Sack,
shut,’ and all will immediately return into the knapsack, and it will
shut of itself.”

 The man thanked him heartily for his gift, and went his way. When he
had gone some distance, he said, “Open, sack,” and immediately the
knapsack opened of itself, and supplied him with food in plenty. When he
had had enough, he said, “Sack, shut,” and the food sprang into the
knapsack, which closed of itself. When he got home, he continued to use
it as the Frost directed.

 When he and his wife had lived comfortably thus for some time, the rich
brother began to covet the knapsack, and wanted to buy it. He gave his
poor brother a hundred oxen and cows, and as many horses and sheep. Thus
the poor brother became rich, but he was not much better off, for he had
to feed the animals. They all gathered round him, and he was now as poor
as before. He did not know what to do, except to go back to the Frost
and ask for a new sack. The Frost said, “Why were you so thoughtless as
to give away such a knapsack? You are now just as poor as before.” But
at length he gave him a new knapsack, much handsomer than <span
id="page_74">p. 74</span> the first. The poor brother thanked him
heartily, and went away joyful, for he thought he had got a knapsack
like the first.

 When he felt hungry, he said as before, “Open, sack.” Immediately the
knapsack opened, and two fellows sprang out with thick cudgels in their
hands, who beat him as if it was a fine art. The man was so overwhelmed
that he could hardly utter the words, “Sack, shut!” Then the two retired
and the knapsack shut. The man thought to himself, “Have patience! I’ll
exchange this with my brother.” When he got home, his brother noticed
what a fine knapsack he had, and wanted to exchange. The other had no
objection, and the exchange was soon effected. Then the rich brother
invited all his relatives and the distinguished people of the
neighbourhood, for he thought to use the knapsack first to provide a
grand feast.

 As soon as all these people were assembled, the host cried out, “Open,
sack!” Then the knapsack indeed opened, but the men with the cudgels
leaped out among the people, and belaboured them so lustily that they
all fled in different directions, and some barely escaped with their
lives. They all caught it hot, both the host and his guests. When <span
id="page_75">p. 75</span> at length the host cried out in his distress,
“Sack, shut!” the men sprang back, and the sack closed. But now the
bolder guests themselves gave the host a good beating before they left.
After this, things went as badly with the rich brother as with the poor
one before. He kept the handsome knapsack, but the men with the cudgels
were in it, and if he only thought of opening it, they laid them on his
back. But the poor brother had enough for himself and his wife from the
first knapsack as long as he lived.

 

 Versions of this story are current throughout Europe; but in general,
the magical properties (of which there are usually two or three) are
stolen or exchanged by a designing innkeeper, or other person, without
the knowledge of the owner.
