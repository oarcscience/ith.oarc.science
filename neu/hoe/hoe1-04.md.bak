# PART I

## THE HERO OF ESTHONIA

T<span class="small">HE</span> *Kalevipoeg*, which may be called the
national epic of Esthonia, contains the adventures of a mythical hero of
gigantic size, who ruled over the country in its days of independence
and prosperity. He is always called by his patronymic, Kalevipoeg, or
Kalevide, the son of Kalev; and, notwithstanding the great differences
between them, he is evidently the Kullervo of the Finnish *Kalevala*.

 The *Kalevipoeg* consists of twenty cantos and about 19,000 lines; and
a fairly complete prose outline of the story is here given, all the
tedious lyrical interludes which break its continuity, especially at the
beginning of several of the cantos, being entirely omitted. For further
<span id="page_2">p. 2</span> general information respecting the poem
itself we will refer to the Introduction, and will now proceed to give a
short abstract of the principal contents of the cantos, before
proceeding to a more detailed analysis.
