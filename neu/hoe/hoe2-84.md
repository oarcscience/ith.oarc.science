Siuru, bird of azure plumage,<br />
With the shining silken feathers,<br />
<span id="page_293">p. 293</span> Was not reared by care of father,<br />
Nor the nursing of her mother,<br />
Nor affection of her sisters,<br />
Nor protection of her brothers;<br />
For the bird was wholly nestless,<br />
Like a swallow needing shelter,<br />
Where her down could grow to feathers<br />
And her wing-plumes could develop;<br />
Yet did Ukko wisely order,<br />
And the aged Father’s wisdom<br />
Gave his daughter wind-like pinions,<br />
Wings of wind and cloudy pinions,<br />
That his child might float upon them,<br />
Far into the distance soaring.<br />
 Siuru, bird and Taara’s daughter,<br />
Siuru, bird of azure plumage,<br />
Sailed afar into the distance,<br />
And she winged her way to southward,<br />
Then she turned again to northward,<br />
And above three worlds went sailing.<br />
One of these the world of maidens,<br />
One where dwell the curly-headed,<br />
One the home of prattling children,<br />
Where the little ones are tended.<br />
 Siuru bird outspread her pinions,<br />
Wide her silken plumes expanding,<br />
Soaring far aloft to heaven.<br />
To the fortress of the sunlight,<br />
To the lighter halls of moonlight,<br />
To the little gate of copper.<br />
 Siuru bird outspread her pinions,<br />
<span id="page_294">p. 294</span> Wide her silken plumes expanding,<br />
Soaring far into the distance,<br />
Till she reached her home at evening;<br />
And her father asked his daughter,<br />
“Whither have thy pinions borne thee?<br />
Whither didst thou take thy journey?<br />
Tell me what thine eyes have witnessed.”<br />
 Siuru heard and comprehended,<br />
And without alarm she answered,<br />
“Where my pinions have conveyed me,<br />
There I scattered feathers from me;<br />
Where I sailed above the country,<br />
There I scattered silken feathers;<br />
Where I shook and flapped my pinions,<br />
From my tail I dropped the feathers:<br />
What I saw with marten keenness,<br />
Might be told in seven narrations,<br />
Or in eight tales be recounted.<br />
Long I flew on path of thunder,<br />
On the roadway of the rainbow,<br />
And the hailstone’s toilsome pathway;<br />
Onwards thus I sailed light-hearted,<br />
Heedless, far into the distance,<br />
And at length three worlds discovered,<br />
One the country of the maidens,<br />
One where dwell the curly-headed,<br />
One the world of prattling children,<br />
Where the little ones are tended;<br />
There it is they rear the fair ones,<br />
Slender-grown and silky-headed.”<br />
 “What thou heardest? speak and tell me;<br />
<span id="page_295">p. 295</span> What thou sawest, let us hear it.”<br />
“What then heard I, sire beloved,<br />
What beheld, O dearest father?<br />
There I heard the sport of maidens,<br />
There I heard their mirth and sadness,<br />
Jesting from the curly-headed,<br />
From the little infants wailing.<br />
Wherefore, said the maidens, jesting,<br />
Do the curly-headed children<br />
Dwell in solitude and lonely,<br />
Living thus apart from nurses?<br />
And they asked in every quarter,<br />
Are no youths in starry regions,<br />
Youths of starry birth or other,<br />
Who might dwell among the maidens,<br />
And amuse the curly-headed?”<br />
 Ukko heard her words, and answered,<br />
“Soar away, my dearest daughter,<br />
Steer thy flight again to southward,<br />
Sailing, far away till evening,<br />
Turning then unto the northward,<br />
Come before the doors of Ukko,<br />
To the western mother’s threshold,<br />
To the northern mother’s region;<br />
Seek thou there the youths to woo them,<br />
Youths that may release the maidens.”<br />
