 The story of Tiidu<span id="page_303_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_303_note_1.md)
the Flute-player introduces us to a mysterious old man, and is therefore
given a place after the narrative of the stolen prince. It contains many
points of interest, including the cosmopolitan incident of the Nose-tree
(which, however, some critics suggest is probably a recent addition);
but it is long and tedious in the original, and therefore only an
abstract is given here.

## TIIDU THE FLUTE-PLAYER.

A <span class="small">POOR</span> man with a large family had among them
a lazy useless son who would do nothing but play tunes on a willow-pipe.
One day a strange old man passed by, and asked what trade he would
prefer. He replied that he would like to be rich and independent. The
old man advised him to make use of the gift he had, and to earn money
<span id="page_304">p. 304</span> enough by playing on his willow-flute
to buy a flute.<span id="page_304_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_304_note_1.md) So
Tiidu left his home without telling his parents of his intention, but
they were glad enough to be rid of him. He wandered from village to
village till he had earned enough money to buy a good flute, and in a
few years he became a famous and prosperous flute-player. But his
avarice left him no peace, and he heard so much of the wealth of the
land of Kungla, that he longed to go there to make his fortune.

 One day he arrived at the town of Narva, where he found a ship just
sailing for Kungla; but as he could not afford to pay his passage, he
contrived to smuggle himself on board with the aid of one of the
sailors. On the following night, Tiidu’s friend threw him into the sea
with a rope round his body, when Tiidu began to cry for help, and his
friend roused the other sailors. The captain crossed himself thrice, and
on being assured by the sailors that it was not a spirit but a mortal
man, ordered a rope to be thrown to the aid of the swimmer. As soon as
<span id="page_305">p. 305</span> Tiidu seized the rope, he cut away
that which was fastened round him, and on being hauled on board,
pretended to have swum from the shore. On this the captain offered him a
free passage, and he amused the crew with his flute during the voyage.

 When Tiidu reached Kungla, he set out for the capital, which he found
to be a city of great wealth and splendour. He was afraid to try his
luck with his flute, and after many days he succeeded in obtaining a
post as kitchen-boy. All the utensils were of gold and silver, the food
was cooked in silver pots, the cakes were baked in silver pans, and
dinner was served up in golden cups and dishes, and even the pigs fed
from silver pails. Tiidu’s month’s wages were larger than he would have
earned in a year at home, but still he was very discontented.

 One day Tiidu’s master gave a christening, and distributed fine clothes
to his servants; and next Sunday Tiidu put them on and went to a
pleasure-garden, where he met his old friend who had advised him to play
the flute, and who now reproached him for having neglected to use it in
Kungla. He made him fetch it and begin to play, when a crowd gathered
round, who made a good collection for <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
Tiidu. The old man gave Tiidu full instructions how to follow the
vocation of a flute-player profitably, and Tiidu followed his advice and
grew very rich.

 At last he decided to return home, and chartered a ship to convey
himself and his treasures to his native land; but a great storm arose,
the ship was wrecked, and only Tiidu contrived to struggle ashore. He
lay dazed for a time, and dreamed that the old man visited him, and gave
him a pull from his flask. Next morning, much refreshed, he wandered
into the country, which he found to be an uninhabited island. He now
repented of his undutiful conduct in leaving his parents, and felt his
sad plight to be a fitting punishment for his fault.

 All at once he saw a tree with beautiful red apples, feasted on them,
lay down to sleep for the night, breakfasted on the apples, and walked
on; but on stooping down to drink at a spring, he saw to his horror that
his nose hung down to his middle, and looked like the wattles of an
enraged turkey-cock; and the more he lamented his misfortune, the bigger
and bluer became his nose. At last he discovered a nut-tree, and found
that eating a few nuts restored his nose to its natural state. So he
laid in a stock <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> of nuts, wove himself
a basket, which he filled with apples, and then slept under the tree,
when the old man appeared to him in a dream, advised him to return to
the shore, and gave him a new flute.

 When he reached the shore, he was picked up by a passing vessel, and
returned to Kungla, where he disguised himself, sold the apples at the
palace, and next day presented himself in another guise as a learned
foreign physician to cure the king and the royal family of the
turkey-disease. In return, Tiidu asked only as much reward as would
enable him to purchase an estate on which he could live comfortably for
the rest of his life, but the king cheerfully gave him three times as
much as he asked, and Tiidu then went to the harbour and sailed home.
First, however, he paid his passage-money to the captain who had rescued
him from the desert island.

 On reaching home, Tiidu found his father and several brothers and
sisters still living, but his mother and some of his brothers were dead.
He bought an estate, invited the whole family to a great feast, and
revealed himself to them, and he insisted that they should all settle on
his estate, <span id="page_308">p. 308</span> and that his father should
stay with him in his own house as long as he lived.

 A little later he married a good and pretty but dowerless girl, and on
entering the bridal chamber they found that it contained all the
treasures which Tiidu had lost at sea, with a paper attached: “Even the
depths of the sea restore the treasures which they have stolen to a good
son who cares for parents and relatives.” But Tiidu never discovered
anything about the aged enchanter who had been his friend and protector.

in the stories relative to the Thunder-God’s musical instrument, Löwe
calls it a bagpipe; but I do not find this meaning for the word in the
dictionaries. Still, in the present story, it appears to have been a
rather expensive instrument.
