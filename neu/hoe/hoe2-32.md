## THE FOUR GIFTS OF THE WATER-SPRITE. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

F<span class="small">OUR</span> boys were playing one Sunday on the
banks of Lake Peipus, when the water-spirit appeared to them in the form
of an old man with long grey hair and beard, and gave each of them a
present—a boat, a hammer, a ploughshare, and a little book. As they grew
up, one became a smith, another a fisherman, another a farmer, and the
last a great king, who conquered the Danes and Swedes.

 

 After this story, of which we have only given a brief abstract, we
place another, descriptive of the dwellings of the lake-spirits.
