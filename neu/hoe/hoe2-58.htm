<H2 ALIGN="center">THE BEWITCHED HORSE.</H2>

<P>A <SMALL>FARMER&#8217;S</SMALL> old horse had died, so he skinned it, and threw it behind the threshing-floor, intending to bury it next day. He saw a great toad creep under it as he went away. At night he went into the barn to sleep, and hearing a noise outside, kept watch for thieves; but, to his horror, he saw the door slowly open, and his dead horse enter. The horse came in snuffling and snorting, and broke down several of the posts that supported the loft where his master had been sleeping; but the farmer contrived to scramble into the rafters. At last the cock crew, when the horse fell down like a lump of meat, and the farmer too lost his hold and fell upon him. Next morning the farmer buried the horse, and stamped three times with his left heel on the grave; so the horse remained quiet.</P>

<P>&#8195;But it was a sorcerer who had a grudge against the farmer who had sent the toad into the carcass of the horse.</P>
