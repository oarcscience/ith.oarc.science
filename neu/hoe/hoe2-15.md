## POLYPHEMUS.<span id="page_38_fr_1"></span> (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

I<span class="small">N</span> the Esthonian version the Devil visits a
locksmith, who promises to cast him new eyes. When the Devil calls for
them, he binds him to a bench on his back, telling him that his name is
Myself. He then pours molten tin into his eyes, and the Devil jumps up
with the pain, and rushes out with the bench on his back, telling his
companions that “Myself” has done it. He dies miserably, and the dog,
fox, rat, and wolf bury him under the dung of a white mare. “Since
this,” adds the narrator, “there has been no devil more.” There is a
very similar story from Swedish Lappmark, in which the man who outwits
and blinds a giant tells him that his own name is “Nobody.”<span
