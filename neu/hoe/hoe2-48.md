## EMMU LAKE AND VIRTS LAKE. (K<span class="small">REUTZWALD.</span>)

S<span class="small">OON</span> after the Creation, Vanaisa<span
id="page_144_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_144_note_1) formed a beautiful lake,
called the Emmu Lake, which was intended to furnish men with refreshing
water at all times, but owing to the wickedness of men, he caused all
the water to be absorbed by a waterspout. Now men had nothing but
rain-water, and although rainwater and melted snow sometimes filled the
old Emmu Lake, it was dirty and unrefreshing, and people called it the
Virts Lake. But at length Vanaisa, took pity on the people, who had
somewhat improved, and formed narrow channels in the earth, through
which the waters of the old Emmu lake flow as springs. But to prevent
their being too warm in summer and too cold in winter, a cold stone is
put into the springs in spring, and replaced by a warm one in autumn.
