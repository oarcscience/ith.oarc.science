# SECTION V

### *STORIES OF THE GODS, AND SPIRITS OF THE ELEMENTS*

V<span class="small">ANEMUINE</span> appears in the *Kalevala*, under
his Finnish name of Väinämöinen, as a culture-hero, though in the first
recension of the poem, as well as in most of the creation-myths of the
Finns, the creation is ascribed to him, and not to his mother, Ilmatar.
He is, however, always a great musician, and in Esthonian tales usually
appears rather in the character of a god than of a patriarch.

 We read much of Väinämöinen’s playing and singing in the *Kalevala*,
especially in Runo 46, where he charms all nature by his playing and
singing, like Orpheus. In Runo 50 he is described as leaving Finland on
account of his authority departing at the coming of Christ; though it is
said by an old writer that the favourite deities <span id="page_81">p.
81</span> of the Finns in his time were Väinämöinen and the Virgin Mary.
