## THE DEVIL’S TREASURE. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

A <span class="small">TRAVELLING</span> Swedish shoemaker saw a fire
burning one night on the Sand Mountain, and on reaching the spot, found
an iron chest, which he opened, and finding it to contain a pot of gold,
helped himself to a good supply. He then left his situation, and
wandered about till he came to Ringen, where he was appointed shoemaker
to the castle. One evening he was alone in his room when he heard a horn
blown twice, but each time he went out and found nothing. He then took
his prayer-book in his hand, ate his supper, and went to bed, but was
awakened by a tremendous noise in the castle. On opening his eyes, he
saw that his room was lit up with tapers, and two women, one in a red
and the other in a green dress, stood by his bed, who invited him to
dance. Half asleep, he cried out, “To hell with you! Is this a time to
dance?” They reminded him of the money which he had taken, left the
room, and banged the door after them, <span id="page_226">p. 226</span>
so that the whole castle shook. The lights went out, and the shoemaker
turned over and went to sleep again. Next morning he found himself lying
terribly bruised, with his head and body in the hall, and his legs in
the room. On his breast were the impress of two hands, showing prints of
all the fingers. Shortly afterwards he died, having confessed to the
priest, and left all his money for a church-bell. The chest was found
empty, the demons having carried off their treasure again; but the
shoemaker was buried under the pulpit in the church at Ringen.
