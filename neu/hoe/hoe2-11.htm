<H2 ALIGN="center">THE MAN IN THE MOON.</H2>

<P>S<SMALL>TORIES</SMALL> of the Man in the Moon are generally common. In Esthonia it is generally the Woman in the Moon, as may be seen in the two beautiful legends of Videvik, and of the Maiden at the Vaskjalla Bridge. The short legend which follows these resembles that in the Prose Edda relative to two children carrying a bucket (Jack and Jill?) who were taken to himself by the Moon. The story of the Moon-Painter might have been inserted here; but it seemed to come in more appropriately in another place.</P>

<P>&#8195;We meet with sons and daughters of the Sun and Moon among the Finns and Lapps, as well as among the Esthonians.</P>
