On the west wind’s path of copper,<br />
On the pathway of the rainbow,<br />
With the king’s note in my wallet,<br />
And his mandate in my bosom,<br />
And upon my tongue defiance,<br />
What was that which came to meet me,<br />
And what horror to confound me?<br />
Nothing but an ancient corbie,<br />
Aged crow, a wretched creature;<br />
<span id="page_288">p. 288</span> With his beak he sniffed around him,<br />
And his nostrils snuffed the vapour;<br />
He had smelt the war already,<br />
When his nostrils snuffed the vapour,<br />
That he might discern the message<br />
Which I carried in my pocket;<br />
He had smelt the war already,<br />
And the scent of blood allured him.<br />
 To the Finnish Bridge when driving<br />
On the west wind’s path of copper,<br />
On the pathway of the rainbow,<br />
Swift I hastened as an envoy,<br />
With the king’s note in my wallet,<br />
And his mandate in my bosom,<br />
In my charge the leader’s orders,<br />
And upon my tongue the secret<br />
That the flags in breeze should flutter,<br />
And the lance-points smite in battle,<br />
And the swords should do their duty.<br />
What was that which came to meet me,<br />
And what horror to confound me?<br />
’ Twas an eagle came to meet me,<br />
Eagle fierce with beak hooked sharply;<br />
With his beak he sniffed around him,<br />
Through the mist he pushed his nostrils,<br />
By the scent he sought to fathom<br />
What was in the envoy’s message.<br />
He had smelt the war already,<br />
And the scent of blood had reached him,<br />
And he went to call his comrades.<br />
 To the Finnish Bridge when driving<br />
<span id="page_289">p. 289</span> On the west wind’s path of copper,<br />
On the pathway of the rainbow,<br />
Swift I hastened on as envoy,<br />
With the king’s note in my wallet,<br />
And his mandate in my bosom,<br />
And upon my tongue the secret<br />
And the leader’s secret orders<br />
That the flags should now be waving,<br />
And the spear-points should be sharpened,<br />
What was it I there encountered,<br />
And what met me there to vex me?<br />
’ Twas the raven’s son that met me,<br />
’ Twas a carrion-bird that met me;<br />
With his beak he sniffed around him,<br />
And his nostrils snuffed the vapour,<br />
That the meaning of my message<br />
With his nose he thus might fathom.<br />
He had smelt the war already,<br />
And the scent of blood had reached him,<br />
And he went to call his comrades.<br />
 To the Finnish Bridge when driving<br />
On the west wind’s path of copper,<br />
On the pathway of the rainbow,<br />
While I hastened as an envoy,<br />
With the king’s note in my wallet,<br />
And his mandate in my bosom,<br />
And upon my tongue the secret,<br />
And the leader’s secret orders,<br />
What was that which came to meet me,<br />
And what horror to confound me?<br />
’ Twas a little wolf that met me,<br />
<span id="page_290">p. 290</span> And a bear that followed closely;<br />
With their snouts they sniffed around them,<br />
Through the mist they pushed their nostrils,<br />
Seeking thus to probe the secret,<br />
And the letter to discover;<br />
They had smelt the war already,<br />
And the scent of blood had reached them,<br />
And they ran to spread the tidings.<br />
 To the Finnish Bridge when driving<br />
On the west wind’s path of copper,<br />
On the pathway of the rainbow,<br />
While I hastened as an envoy,<br />
With the king’s note in my wallet,<br />
And his mandate in my bosom,<br />
And upon my tongue defiance,<br />
With the leader’s secret orders<br />
That the flags unfurled should flutter,<br />
And the spear-points do their duty,<br />
And the axes should be lifted,<br />
And the swords should flash in sunlight,<br />
What was that which came to meet me,<br />
And what horror to confound me?<br />
It was Famine met me tottering,<br />
Tottering Famine, chewing garbage;<br />
With her nose she sniffed around her,<br />
That the meaning of my message<br />
With her nose she thus might fathom;<br />
For she smelt the war already,<br />
And the scent of blood had reached her,<br />
And she went to call her comrades.<br />
 To the Finnish Bridge while driving<br />
<span id="page_291">p. 291</span> On the west wind’s path of copper,<br />
On the pathway of the rainbow,<br />
While I hastened as an envoy,<br />
With the king’s note in my wallet,<br />
And his mandate in my bosom,<br />
On my tongue the secret orders<br />
That the flags unfurled should flutter,<br />
And the spear-points do their duty,<br />
And the axes and the fish-spears<br />
All should do the work before them,<br />
What was that which came to meet me,<br />
What unlooked-for horror met me?<br />
’ Twas the Plague I there encountered,<br />
Crafty Plague, the people’s murderer,<br />
Of the sevenfold war-plagues direst;<br />
With his nose he sniffed around him,<br />
And his nostrils snuffed the vapour,<br />
Seeking thus to probe the matter,<br />
And the letter to discover;<br />
He had smelt the war already,<br />
And the scent of blood had lured him<br />
And he went to call his comrades.<br />
 After this my horse I halted,<br />
Yoked him with a yoke of iron,<br />
Fettered him with Kalev’s fetters,<br />
That he stood as rooted firmly,<br />
From the spot to move unable,<br />
While I pondered and considered,<br />
Deeply in my heart reflecting<br />
If the profit of my journey<br />
Were not lost in greater evil<br />
<span id="page_292">p. 292</span> For the war brings wounds and bloodshed,<br />
And the war has throat of serpent.<br />
Wherefore then should I the battle,<br />
Whence springs only pain and murder,<br />
Forth to peaceful homesteads carry?<br />
Let a message so accursed<br />
In the ocean-depths be sunken,<br />
There to sleep in endless slumber,<br />
Lost among the spawn of fishes,<br />
There to rest in deepest caverns,<br />
Rather than that I should take it,<br />
Till it spreads among the hamlets.<br />
Thereupon I took the mandate<br />
Which I carried in my wallet,<br />
And amid the depths I sunk it,<br />
Underneath the waves of ocean,<br />
Till the waves to foam had torn it,<br />
And to mud had quite reduced it,<br />
While the fishes fled before it.<br />
Thus was hushed the sound of warfare,<br />
Thus was lost the news of battle.<br />

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_287">p. 287</span>

<span id="page_287_note_1"></span>[1](#page_287_fr_1.md) *Kalevipoeg*,
Canto 9, lines 769-925. Neus, *Ehstnische Volkslieder*, pp. 305-311. The
manner in which the gathering symbols of the horrors of war, each more
terrible than the last, are successively brought upon the scene in this
poem is very fine.
