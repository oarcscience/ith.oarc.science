## CANTO XIII <span class="small">THE KALEVIDE’S FIRST JOURNEY TO HADES</span>

O<span class="small">N</span> the Kalevide’s homeward journey he slept
for a night at the place where his sword had been stolen, and set out
early next morning, making his way through bush and brake. He walked on
till sunset with his load of planks without stopping to rest, and then
ate his supper and prepared himself a bed of sand as usual. When he
awoke in the morning, a magpie informed him for the first time that the
sorcerer had kept him in a magic sleep for seven weeks, and he quickened
his pace. But when he reached Lake Ilma he found it, to his disgust, too
deep to wade through, and he was compelled to go round it.

 Presently he encountered an old witch, a relative of the sorcerer who
had done him so much harm already, sitting among the bushes and singing
magic songs. The hero stopped to rest himself, for the day <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> was very warm, and listened to her song, which
was a long charm against snake-bites. Then he walked on till noon, when
he took a siesta, breaking down trees of all kinds to make himself a
couch. Afterwards he turned to the left in the direction of Lake Endla,
and towards evening he came to the entrance of a cavern, before which a
great fire was burning. A huge caldron hung over it by heavy iron
chains, just opposite the entrance to the cavern, and three fellows were
standing round, who grinned and whispered to each other as the stranger
approached.

 The Kalevide threw down the planks and asked the men what they had got
in the caldron, and whether they were getting ready for a feast or a
wedding. They replied that the caldron cooked for everybody, and that
when they made a feast they killed a great ox. It took a hundred men to
kill it, five hundred to bleed it, and a thousand to cleanse it.<span
id="page_88_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_88_note_1.md) But to-day they were only
cooking for poor people; only half an elk, the ribs of an old boar, the
lungs and liver of a bear, the suet of a young wolf, the hide of an old
bear, and an egg <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> from an eagle’s nest.
Old Sarvik<span id="page_89_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_89_note_1.md) and the
old mother were to dine from it; the cat and dog were to get their
share, and the rest was to be divided among the cooks and workmen; but
the old mother was going to bake cakes for the young ladies’ dinner.

 The Kalevide expressed his disgust at such cookery, but they told him
it was good enough for witches and sorcerers, and he then asked them to
show him the way to their master’s house, as he wished to pay his
respects to the family. They warned him that he might not escape easily;
but as he persisted, they directed him to the cavern, which he
immediately entered, while the demons laughed, saying that the bear had
fallen into the trap and the lion<span
id="page_89_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_89_note_2.md) into the net, and that he
was carrying his hide to market for nothing.

 The cave was so dark and narrow that the hero soon found himself
obliged to creep on all fours, and to grope his way. At last he
perceived a faint light at a distance, and the cavern enlarged so much
that he could now stand upright again.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

 Where the roof rose highest, a heavy lamp hung by chains from the
ceiling, and beyond it were great folding-doors. On each side stood a
jar, one filled with a liquid as white as milk, and the other with a
liquid as black as pitch. Inside he could hear maidens spinning and
singing,<span id="page_90_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_90_note_1.md) lamenting
the happiness of their former lives, and hoping that some deliverer
might appear. Then he strove to force the door, but it resisted all his
efforts, so he sang a song in his softest tones, telling how he had
encountered four fair maidens gathering flowers in the woods. The
maidens sang back that he had come at a good time, for all the family
were out, and they directed him to dip his hands in the dark liquid,
which would give him magic strength; but if he wished to moderate his
strength, then to dip his hands in the white liquid, for the dark liquid
would give him strength to dash everything to pieces.

 The hero dipped his hands in the dark liquid, and felt his strength
redoubled. He pushed against the door again, and the door and door-posts
too came thundering to the ground. The maidens fled into the adjoining
room, crying out <span id="page_91">p. 91</span> to him not to approach
them till he had dipped his hands in the white liquid, which would
remove the enchantment. He laughed, and, notwithstanding their
entreaties, followed them into the next room, where he saw a naked
sword, a small willow wand, and a ragged old hat hanging on the wall.
“Look,” cried he joyfully, “this is the sword which I saw forged for me
in my dream!”

 “Beware,” said one of the maidens, “do not touch that sword, for it
belongs to Sarvik; but take the rod and the hat, for they are yours, and
you can work any wonders with them. Swords you can only obtain from the
smith himself.” But the Kalevide answered that he could have his will
without the wishing-rod and cap, which were only fit for witches and
wizards. So the maiden, who was anxious to convince him of the value of
the treasures which he despised, took down the hat from its peg. It was
made of the cuttings of finger-nails,<span
id="page_91_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_91_note_1.md) and she declared that
there was not <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> another like it in the
world, for it could fulfil every desire of its possessor. So she put it
on her head and said—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="small">“Raise thee, raise thee, golden<span id="page_92_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_92_note_1">1</a> maiden,<br />
Blue-eyed maiden, raise thee, raise thee,<br />
Like unto the son of Kalev,<br />
Like unto thy friend in stature.”<br />
</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 She began at once to grow taller, ell after ell, till she grew fully as
tall as the son of Kalev himself.

 Then the Kalevide took the hat from her head and set it on his own,
wishing to become as small as she had been. His stature immediately
sank, ell after ell, till he was reduced to the size of an ordinary
man.<span id="page_92_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_92_note_2.md) The young
giantess took back the hat, and wished to resume her former stature,
which accordingly befell.

 The Kalevide then said to the maiden that he would willingly remain a
little boy that day for her sake, but he was now anxious to keep the
hat, that he <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> might at once resume his
own stature and strength in case of any sudden and unexpected danger.
They sang and danced and sported to their heart’s content, and the
maiden called her second sister, whose duty it was to polish the gold,
silver, and copper ware; and her third sister, who tended the geese on
the common; and the sisters locked and bolted the kitchen door, for fear
the old woman should hear the noise and come to disturb their merriment.

 The maidens were delighted, for though the Kalevide declared that he
could not think of marrying a wife himself, he would deliver them from
Hades next day, and would marry one to the son of Alev, one to the son
of Sulev, and one to the cup-bearer.<span
id="page_93_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_93_note_1.md) So they played all sorts
of games; the falcon-game, in which the hero was the falcon, and they
were the birds; kiss-in-the-ring, blind man’s buff, &c. But whatever
they played at, the hero always got the best of the game. When they were
tired of this amusement, they put out all the lights.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_88">p. 88</span>

<span id="page_88_note_1"></span>[1](#page_88_fr_1.md) We meet with this
big ox elsewhere in the *Kalevipoeg* (Canto 19), as well as in the
*Kalevala*, Runo 20.

<span id="footnotes_page_89">p. 89</span>

<span id="page_89_note_1"></span>[1](#page_89_fr_1.md) Old Hornie, the name
of the ruler of Pōrgu (Hell).

<span id="page_89_note_2"></span>[2](#page_89_fr_2.md) The word used for
lion is “*lōwi*,” undoubtedly derived from the German. The Finns
generally call the lion “*jalopeura*,” which also denotes the lynx.

<span id="footnotes_page_90">p. 90</span>

<span id="page_90_note_1"></span>[1](#page_90_fr_1.md) Compare the story of
the Gold Spinners.

<span id="footnotes_page_91">p. 91</span>

<span id="page_91_note_1"></span>[1](#page_91_fr_1.md) We meet with a
similar hat in other stories. Many Esthonians and Lithuanians still hide
their nail-parings as carefully as possible, or else make a cross over
them lest the devil should find them and use them to make a wishing-hat.
Can this hat have any connection with the white straw hat of the devil
in a Deptford rhyme?—Gomme’s *Traditional Games*, I. p. 4. In the Edda,
we are told that Naglfar, the largest ship in the world, which is to
bring the <span id="footnotes_page_92">p. 92</span> giants to the fight
at Ragnarok, is similarly constructed, and as both gods and men wish
that it should be completed as late as possible, every one shauld be
very careful not to die with unpared nails, lest he should supply
materials for its construction.

<span id="footnotes_page_92">p. 92</span>

<span id="page_92_note_1"></span>[1](#page_92_fr_1.md) Golden is often used
in Finnish and Esthonian, as in many other languages, as a term of
endearment.

<span id="page_92_note_2"></span>[2](#page_92_fr_2.md) The maidens were
afterwards married to the relatives of the Kalevide, giants like
himself, and described as walking arm-in-arm with them, nothing being
then said of any difference in their stature.

<span id="footnotes_page_93">p. 93</span>

<span id="page_93_note_1"></span>[1](#page_93_fr_1.md) This reminds us of a
well-known feudal custom, more honoured in the breach than in the
observance, which also prevailed among the old kings of Scotland for
several reigns. The second sister was ultimately married, not to the
cup-bearer, but to the son of Olev.
