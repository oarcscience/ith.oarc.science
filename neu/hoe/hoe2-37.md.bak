## THE WILL O’ THE WISPS. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

A <span class="small">FARMER</span> was driving home one winter evening
from Fellin across the Parika heath, when he suddenly saw a little blue
flame on one side, and his horse stopped short and would not move. It
was as if he had been stopped by a ditch. He dismounted, and found not a
ditch, but an open pit; and he could not drive round it, because there
was deep water on all sides. Presently he saw a light flare up like a
torch, and then another, till many of them were flitting about
everywhere. In consternation, the farmer cried out, “Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, what’s going on here to-night?” The horse sprang forward, as
if somebody had stuck a pin into him, and the farmer had only just time
to tumble on the sledge, when they went off at full gallop; and the
farmer could say that the name of God had occurred to him just at the
right time.
