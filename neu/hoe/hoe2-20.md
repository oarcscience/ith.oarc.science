## THE WITCH-BRIDE.

V<span class="small">ERSIONS</span> of this story are common in Finland
as well as in Esthonia. One of the latter is “Rōugutaja’s Daughter”
(Kreutzwald). Old Rōugutaja<span
id="page_45_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_45_note_1) lived with his wife and
daughter in a wood. The daughter had a beautiful face, but it was
reported that her skin was of bark, and she could find no suitors. At
last the mother contrived to inveigle a youth into marrying her daughter
by means of a love-philtre, but on the first night be ran away, and
shortly afterwards married another bride. On the birth <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> of a child, the witch-mother transforms the
young mother into a wolf, and substitutes her own daughter. The nurse is
ordered to take the crying child for a walk; she meets the wolf; the
deceit is discovered, and the husband inveigles the witch-mother and
daughter into the bathhouse, and burns it down.

 There is little in this story except the bark-skin of the witch-bride
to distinguish it from the numerous variants among other peoples.
