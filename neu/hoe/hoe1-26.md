# PART II

## Esthonian Folk-Tales

T<span class="small">HESE</span> are very numerous, and, while some are
of course identical with well-known stories of world-wide distribution,
others have a peculiarly original character of their own. We have
divided them into sections, but this classification must not be taken as
too stringent, for many tales would fall equally well under two or three
of our separate headings. In so far as any foreign elements are visible,
they are apparently Scandinavian or German. Finnish tales show more
trace of Russian influence, but there is seldom any visible in Esthonian
tales, and even in the *Kalevipoeg* there is no resemblance to the
Russian hero-legends. It is, however, noteworthy that even in the most
heathenish tales, the heroes usually have names of <span
id="page_146">p. 146</span> Christian origin; though not in the
*Kalevipoeg*. It is possible that the Gospel of Nicodemus, which
describes the descent into hell, may have suggested the name of
Nicodemus for Slyboots.
