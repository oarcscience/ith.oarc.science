 Our next story is a very odd one about a hat.

## THE GOOD DEED REWARDED. (K<span class="small">REUTZWALD.</span>)

O<span class="small">NCE</span> upon a time a young countryman was busy
raking up his hay in the meadow, when a threatening thundercloud which
arose on the horizon caused him to hasten with his work. He was lucky
enough to complete it before the rain began, and he then turned his
steps homewards. On his way he perceived a stranger asleep under a tree.
“He’ll get his hide pretty well soaked if I leave him asleep here,”
thought the countryman, so he went to the stranger, and shook him till
he roused him from a sound sleep. The stranger stood up, and turned pale
when he saw the advancing thundercloud. He felt in his pocket, intending
to give something to the man who had roused him, but unfortunately he
found it empty. So he said hurriedly, “For the present I must remain
your debtor, but a day will come when I shall be able to show you my
gratitude for your kindness. Do not forget what I tell you. You will
become a soldier. After you have been parted from your friends for
years, a day will come when you will be seized with homesickness <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> in a foreign country. When you look up, you
will see a crooked birch-tree a few steps before you. Go to this tree,
knock on the trunk three times, and say, ‘Is the Humpback at home?’ Then
the rest will follow.” As soon as he had finished speaking, the stranger
hurried away and disappeared in an instant. The countryman went home
too, and soon forgot his meeting with the sleeper on the road.

 Some time afterwards the first part of the prophecy was fulfilled, for
the countryman became a soldier, without his remembering anything of his
adventure in the wood. He had already worn the uniform of a cavalry
regiment for four years, when he was stationed with his regiment in
North Finland. It fell to the turn of our friend to bring home the
horses on a Whitsunday, while his jolly comrades off duty went singing
to enjoy themselves at the inns. Suddenly the solitary groom was seized
with such a fit of home-sickness as he had never known before. Tears
filled his eyes, and charming pictures of home floated before his
vision. Now, too, he remembered his sleeping friend in the wood, and his
speech. Everything came before him as plainly and distinctly as if it
had happened only yesterday. <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> He looked
up, and saw before him, oddly enough, an old crooked birch-tree. More in
jest than expecting any result, he went up to the tree, and did what he
had been instructed. But the question, “Is the Humpback at home?” had
scarcely passed his lips, when the stranger stood before him, and said,
“My friend, it is good that you have come, for I was afraid that you had
quite forgotten me. Isn’t it true that you would be glad to be at home?”
The cavalry soldier sobbed out, “Yes.” Then the Humpback called into the
tree, “Boys, which of you can run fastest?” A voice answered from the
birch, “Father, I can run as fast as a grouse can fly.”—“Very well, I
want a quicker messenger to-day.” A second voice answered, “I can run
like the wind.”—“I want a quicker messenger still,” replied the father.
Then a third voice answered, “I can run as fast as the thoughts of
men.”—“You are just to my mind. I want you now. Fill a
four-hundredweight sack with money, and carry it home with my friend and
benefactor.” Then he seized hold of the soldier’s hat and cried out,
“Let the hat become a man, and let the man and the sack go home!” The
soldier felt his hat fly off his head. He turned round to look for it,
and found himself in his own father’s room, <span id="page_131">p.
131</span> dressed like a countryman as before, and the great sack of
money by his side.<span id="page_131_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_131_note_1.md)

 At first he thought it was a dream, till he found that his good luck
was real. As nobody made any inquiries after the deserter, he began to
think at last that his lost hat had remained behind to do soldier’s
service in his stead. He related the wonderful story to his children
before his death, and as the money had brought him happiness and
prosperity, he could not suppose that it had been the gift of an evil
spirit.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_131">p. 131</span>

<span id="page_131_note_1"></span>[1](#page_131_fr_1.md) The hat reminds us
of the doll in the story of the Tontla Wood. In the original the
stranger is simply called “Köwer.” Jannsen interprets the name to mean
“Köwer-silm” (Crooked-eye), and thinks the stranger might have been
Tapio himself. But it appears to me from the whole context that he was
simply the indwelling spirit of one particular crooked birch-tree, whom
we find at the beginning of the story wandering at a distance from home.
