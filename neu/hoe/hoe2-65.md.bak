treasure through fear.

 

## THE NOCTURNAL CHURCH-GOERS. (K<span class="small">REUTZWALD.</span>)

O<span class="small">NE</span> Christmas Eve the people at a farm-house
a couple of versts from a church went to bed early, intending to go to
early morning service by candle-light. The farmer woke up, and on going
out to see <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> how the weather was, he saw
the church lit up, and thinking he had overslept himself, called his
people and they set out. They found the church lit up and full of
people, but the singing sounded rather strange. When they reached the
open door, the lights and people disappeared, and a stranger came out,
who told them to return, saying, “This is our service; yours begins
to-morrow.” But he took one youth of the party aside, and told him to
come again at midnight three days before St. John’s Eve and he would
make his fortune, but he warned him to keep it secret.

 As the party returned to the farm-house, the sky cleared, and they saw
from the position of the stars that it was midnight. When the matter
came to the pastor’s ears, he tried to persuade the people that it was
only a dream; but the matter could not be hushed up.

 The youth who had received an invitation from the stranger felt very
doubtful about keeping the appointment, especially as he had been
commanded to keep it secret; but a fortnight before the time, he was
going home one evening after sunset, when he saw an old woman sitting by
the roadside, who asked him what he was thinking about so deeply. <span
id="page_228">p. 228</span> He made no answer, and then she asked to
see, his hand to tell his fortune, assuring him that she meant him well.
She put on her spectacles, and after examining his hand for some time,
promised him great good fortune, and told him to go with the stranger
without fear. But if he wished to take a wife, let him not do so without
great consideration, or he might fall into misfortune. She refused any
payment, and hurried away as lightly as a young girl.

 Three days before St. John’s Eve, the youth set out a little before
midnight. A voice cried in his ear, “You are not going right!” and he
was about to turn back when he heard voices singing in the air, which
urged him not to throw away his good fortune, and encouraged him to
proceed. He found the church-door closed, but the stranger came from
behind the left side of the church. He told the youth he feared he might
not have come; and that the church service was held at Christmas only
once in seven years, at a time when men are all asleep. The stranger
then told the youth that there was a grave mound in a certain meadow on
which grew three junipers, and under the middle one a great treasure was
buried. In order to propitiate the <span id="page_229">p. 229</span>
guardians of the treasure, it was needful to slaughter three black
animals, one feathered and two hairy, and to take care that not a drop
of the sacrificial blood was lost, but all offered to the guardians. A
bit of silver was to be scraped from the youth’s buckle that the gleam
of the costly silver might lead him to that which was buried. “Then cut
a stick from the juniper three spans long, turn the point three times
toward the grass where you have offered the blood, and walk nine times
round the juniper bush from west to east. But at every round strike the
grass under the bush three times with the stick, and at every blow say
‘Igrek!’<span id="page_229_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_229_note_1.md) At the
eighth round you will perceive a subterranean jingling of money, and
after the ninth round you will see the gleam of silver. Then fall on
your knees, bend your face to the ground, and cry out nine times
‘Igrek,’ when the treasure will rise.” The seeker must wait patiently
till the treasure has risen, and not allow himself to be frightened by
the spectres which would appear, for they were only soulless
phantoms,<span id="page_229_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_229_note_2.md) to try
the seeker’s courage. If it failed, he would return home with empty
hands. <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> The seeker must go to the hill
on St. John’s Eve, when the bonfires were burning and the people
merrymaking. A third of the treasure was to be given to the poor; the
rest belonged to the finder.

 The stranger repeated his directions three times word for word that the
youth should not forget them, when the sexton’s cock crew and the
stranger vanished suddenly.

 Next day the youth obtained a black cock and a black dog from some
neighbours, and next night be caught a mole. On St. John’s Eve he took
the three animals, and carried out his instructions at midnight,
slaughtering first the cock, then the mole, and lastly the dog, taking
care that every drop of blood should fall on the appointed spot. But
when he had called “Igrek!” at the conclusion of the ceremony, a
fiery-red cock rose suddenly under the juniper, flapped his wings,
crowed and flew away. A shovelful of silver was then cast up at the
youth’s feet. Next a fiery-red cat with long golden claws rose from
under the juniper, mewed, and darted away, when the earth opened and
threw up another shovelful of silver. Next appeared a great fiery-red
dog, with a golden head and tail, who barked, and ran away, when a
shovelful of roubles was cast <span id="page_231">p. 231</span> up at
the youth’s feet. This was followed by a red fox with a golden tail, a
red wolf with two golden heads, and a red bear with three golden heads;
and behind each animal money was thrown out in the grass, but behind the
bear there came about a ton of silver, and the entire heap rose to the
height of a haycock. When the bear had disappeared, there was a rushing
and roaring under the juniper as if fifty smiths were blowing the
bellows at once. Then appeared from the juniper a huge head, half man,
half beast, with golden horns nine feet long, and with golden tusks two
ells long. Still more dreadful were the flames which shot from mouth and
nostrils, and which caused the rushing and roaring. The youth was now
beside himself with terror, and rushed away, fancying himself closely
pursued by the spectre, and at last he fell down in his own farmyard and
fainted. In the morning the sunbeams roused him; and when he came to
himself, he took six sacks with him from the barn to carry off the
treasure. He found the hill with the three junipers, the slaughtered
animals, and the wand; but the earth showed no signs of having been
disturbed, and the treasure had vanished. Probably it still rests
beneath the hill, waiting for a bolder man to raise it.

 The grandson of the unlucky treasure-seeker, who relates this story,
could not say if his grandfather had been equally unfortunate in his
marriage, as he never alluded to the subject.
