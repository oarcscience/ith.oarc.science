## THE GOLDEN SNAKES. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

T<span class="small">WO</span> woodcutters found a number of snakes in
the wood, and one of the men killed some, and he and his comrade
followed them up till they came to a vast mass of snakes, among which
was one with a golden crown. They fled, but were pursued by the
snake-king, when one of them turned round and hit him on the head with
an axe, when he changed into a heap of gold. They then returned to the
cluster of snakes, but they had all disappeared, and they found only
another heap of gold. They divided the money, and with half of it they
built a church.

 

 The previous story is Lithuanian rather than Esthonian in character.
The next has a more diabolical character than any of the preceding.
