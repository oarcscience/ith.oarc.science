<P>&#8195;Kreutzwald relates several other stories of young adventurers who go forth into the world to seek their fortunes with the aid of powerful protectors.</P>

<P>&#8195;In one of these, &#8220;The Magician in the Pocket,&#8221; a young man releases a magician who had been imprisoned by his enemy under a great stone, after which the magician accompanies him in his wanderings in the form of a flea, and helps him to deliver four princesses from enchantment, one of whom he marries. In another, &#8220;The God-Daughter of the Rock-Maidens,&#8221; a young girl named Maasika (Strawberry) is taken down into an underground region by her godmothers, the rock-spirits, one of whom her mother had once aided when in distress. When she is grown up, she goes out into the world, kills the king of the serpents, and disenchants a king, queen, and prince, who prove to be the parents and brother of her godmothers, and she marries the prince. In a third story, &#8220;The Foundling,&#8221; the hero likewise goes out in a similar manner, and meets with various adventures before marrying a princess.<HR></P>
