## THE MAGIC EGG. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

I<span class="small">N</span> former days, people used to find bits of
leather, and fragments of old gloves, shoes, and hats on the moor; but
if anybody took them home, some misfortune befell him. One day a man
found what he thought was a duck’s egg, and boiled and ate it; but the
more he ate, the more there seemed to be, and he could not finish it.
Next morning the portion left proved to be not an egg, but half his
neighbour’s cat.
