## VIDEVIK, KOIT, ANDÄMARIK<span id="page_30_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_30_note_1) <span class="small">(*Twilight, Dawn, and Evening Twilight*.md).</span>

T<span class="small">HE</span> Creator had three diligent servants—two
fair and lovely maidens, Videvik and Ämarik, and the slender youth Koit.
They fulfilled his orders and looked after his affairs. One evening at
sunset, Videvik, the eldest, came back from ploughing with her oxen, and
led them to the river to drink. But maidens are always accustomed to
think first of their own bright faces, and so was it with the charming
Videvik. She thought no more of the oxen, but stepped to the water’s
edge and looked down. And behold, her brown eyes and red cheeks looked
back upon her from the surface of the stream, and her heart beat with
pleasure. But the Moon, whom the Creator had ordered to take the place
of the setting sun to enlighten the world, forgot his duty, and hurried
down to the earth to the bed of the stream. Here he stayed with Videvik,
mouth to mouth and lip to lip.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

 But while the Moon thus forgot his duty, his light became extinguished,
and thick darkness covered the land as he lay on Videvik’s heart. And
now a great misfortune happened. The wolf, the wild beast of the forest,
who could work mischief when no eye could see him, attacked one of
Videvik’s oxen and tore him to pieces. The nightingale sang loudly
through the dark thicket, “Idle maid, idle maid, long is the night.
Black stripes to the yoke, to the yoke! Bring the whip, bring the whip,
whip, whip, whip.” But Videvik heard nothing. She had forgotten
everything but her love.

 Early in the morning, when Koit rose from his couch, Videvik awakened
at last from her dream of love. When she saw the evil deed that the wolf
had wrought, she began to weep bitterly. But the tears of her innocent
affliction were not hidden from the Creator. He descended from his
heaven to punish the evil-doer and to bring the criminal to justice. He
dealt out severe punishment to the wolf, and yoked him high in heaven
with the ox, to draw water for ever, driven by the iron rod of the
pole-star.<span id="page_31_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_31_note_1.md) But to
Videvik he said, “As the Moon has touched thee with the light of his
beauty <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> and has wooed thee, I will
forgive thee, and if thou lovest him from thy heart, I will not hinder
you, and you shall be wedded. But from thee, Videvik, I look for
faithful watch and vigilance that the Moon begins his course at the
right time, and that deep darkness falls no more on earth at night, when
the evil powers can work mischief at their pleasure. Rule over the
night, and take care that a happy peace prevails in its course.”

 Thus the moon received Videvik as his wife. Her friendly countenance
still smiles down upon us, and is reflected in the mirror of the brook,
where she first enjoyed the love of her consort.

 Then the Creator summoned Koit and Ämarik to his presence, and said, “I
will guard against any further negligence respecting the light of the
world, lest darkness should again get the upper hand, and I will appoint
two watchers under whose care all shall run its course. The Moon and
Videvik shall illumine the night with their radiance at the appointed
time. Koit and Ämarik, to your watch and ward I intrust the light of day
beneath the firmament. Fulfil your duty with diligence. To thy care, my
daughter Ämarik, I entrust the sinking sun. Receive him on the horizon,
and carefully <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> extinguish all the sparks
every evening, lest any harm should ensue, and lead him to his setting.
Koit, my active son, let it be thy care to receive the sun from the
hands of Ämarik when he is ready to begin his course, and to kindle new
light, that there may never be any deficiency.”

 The two servants of the sun did their duty with diligence, so that the
sun was never absent from the sky for a day. Then began the long summer
nights when Koit and Ämarik join their hands, when their hearts beat and
their lips meet in a kiss, while the birds in the woods sing sweet songs
each according to his note, when flowers blossom, the trees flourish,
and all the world rejoices. At this time the Creator descended from his
golden throne to earth to celebrate the festival of Lijon.<span
id="page_33_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_33_note_1.md) He found all his works and
affairs in good order, and rejoiced in his creation, and said to Koit
and Ämarik, “I am well pleased with your management, and desire your
lasting happiness. From henceforth be husband and wife.”

 But the two exclaimed with one voice, “Father, let us enjoy our
happiness undisturbed. We are <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> content
with our lot, and will remain lover and beloved, for thus we enjoy a
happiness which is ever young and new.”

 Then the Creator granted them their desire, and returned to his golden
heaven.
