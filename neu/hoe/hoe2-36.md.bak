## THE SPIRIT OF THE WHIRLWIND. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

T<span class="small">WO</span> men were walking together when they saw a
haystack carried away by the wind. The elder man said it was the Spirit
of the Whirlwind; but the other would not believe him till they saw a
cloud of dust, when they turned their backs to it, and the young man
repeated a spell after the old one. When they turned round, they saw an
old grey man with a long white beard, a broad flapping coat, and
streaming hair, devastating the woods. He took no notice of them, but
the elder one cautioned the other not to forget to repeat the spell
whenever he saw him. However, he forgot it, and the whirlwind in a fury
carried him many miles from home, and ever afterwards persecuted him
till he went to his friend and learned the spell again. Next time he saw
the whirlwind he was fishing; and on his repeating the spell, the spirit
passed him angrily, and a great wave surged up from the river, and
wetted the man to the skin. But after that the spirit never reappeared
to him, and left him in peace.
