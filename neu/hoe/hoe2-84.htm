Was not reared by care of father,<BR> Nor the nursing of her mother,<BR> Nor affection of her sisters,<BR> Nor protection of her brothers;<BR> For the bird was wholly nestless,<BR> Like a swallow needing shelter,<BR> Where her down could grow to feathers<BR> And her wing-plumes could develop;<BR> Yet did Ukko wisely order,<BR> And the aged Father&#8217;s wisdom<BR> Gave his daughter wind-like pinions,<BR> Wings of wind and cloudy pinions,<BR> That his child might float upon them,<BR> Far into the distance soaring.<BR> &#8195;Siuru, bird and Taara&#8217;s daughter,<BR> Siuru, bird of azure plumage,<BR> Sailed afar into the distance,<BR> And she winged her way to southward,<BR> Then she turned again to northward,<BR> And above three worlds went sailing.<BR> One of these the world of maidens,<BR> One where dwell the curly-headed,<BR> One the home of prattling children,<BR> Where the little ones are tended.<BR> &#8195;Siuru bird outspread her pinions,<BR> Wide her silken plumes expanding,<BR> Soaring far aloft to heaven.<BR> To the fortress of the sunlight,<BR> To the lighter halls of moonlight,<BR> To the little gate of copper.<BR> &#8195;Siuru bird outspread her pinions,<BR>

Wide her silken plumes expanding,<BR> Soaring far into the distance,<BR> Till she reached her home at evening;<BR> And her father asked his daughter,<BR> &#8220;Whither have thy pinions borne thee?<BR> Whither didst thou take thy journey?<BR> Tell me what thine eyes have witnessed.&#8221;<BR> &#8195;Siuru heard and comprehended,<BR> And without alarm she answered,<BR> &#8220;Where my pinions have conveyed me,<BR> There I scattered feathers from me;<BR> Where I sailed above the country,<BR> There I scattered silken feathers;<BR> Where I shook and flapped my pinions,<BR> From my tail I dropped the feathers:<BR> What I saw with marten keenness,<BR> Might be told in seven narrations,<BR> Or in eight tales be recounted.<BR> Long I flew on path of thunder,<BR> On the roadway of the rainbow,<BR> And the hailstone&#8217;s toilsome pathway;<BR> Onwards thus I sailed light-hearted,<BR> Heedless, far into the distance,<BR> And at length three worlds discovered,<BR> One the country of the maidens,<BR> One where dwell the curly-headed,<BR> One the world of prattling children,<BR> Where the little ones are tended;<BR> There it is they rear the fair ones,<BR> Slender-grown and silky-headed.&#8221;<BR> &#8195;&#8220;What thou heardest? speak and tell me;<BR>

What thou sawest, let us hear it.&#8221;<BR> &#8220;What then heard I, sire beloved,<BR> What beheld, O dearest father?<BR> There I heard the sport of maidens,<BR> There I heard their mirth and sadness,<BR> Jesting from the curly-headed,<BR> From the little infants wailing.<BR> Wherefore, said the maidens, jesting,<BR> Do the curly-headed children<BR> Dwell in solitude and lonely,<BR> Living thus apart from nurses?<BR> And they asked in every quarter,<BR> Are no youths in starry regions,<BR> Youths of starry birth or other,<BR> Who might dwell among the maidens,<BR> And amuse the curly-headed?&#8221;<BR> &#8195;Ukko heard her words, and answered,<BR> &#8220;Soar away, my dearest daughter,<BR> Steer thy flight again to southward,<BR> Sailing, far away till evening,<BR> Turning then unto the northward,<BR> Come before the doors of Ukko,<BR> To the western mother&#8217;s threshold,<BR> To the northern mother&#8217;s region;<BR> Seek thou there the youths to woo them,<BR> Youths that may release the maidens.&#8221;<BR></SMALL></TD></TR>
