# SECTION II

### *ORPHAN AND FOUNDLING STORIES*

T<span class="small">HE</span> Esthonians appear to be very
compassionate towards orphans, for many of their tales relate to the
adventures of neglected or ill-used orphan children, and the wonderful
events by which their welfare was finally secured. Nevertheless, wicked
stepmothers and farmers’ wives are just as common as in other
folk-tales.

 The first story of this class which we have selected, “The Wood of
Tontla,”<span id="page_236_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_236_note_1) is
specially interesting from its resemblance to Tieck’s well-known German
story of “The Elves,” which must originally have been derived from the
same source as the present narrative.

 With the Orphan Stories proper I have placed others relating to stolen
or friendless children.
