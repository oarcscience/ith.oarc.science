## THE MAN IN THE MOON.

S<span class="small">TORIES</span> of the Man in the Moon are generally
common. In Esthonia it is generally the Woman in the Moon, as may be
seen in the two beautiful legends of Videvik, and of the Maiden at the
Vaskjalla Bridge. The short legend which follows these resembles that in
the Prose Edda relative to two children carrying a bucket (Jack and
Jill?) who were taken to himself by the Moon. The story of the
Moon-Painter might have been inserted here; but it seemed to come in
more appropriately in another place.

 We meet with sons and daughters of the Sun and Moon among the Finns and
Lapps, as well as among the Esthonians.
