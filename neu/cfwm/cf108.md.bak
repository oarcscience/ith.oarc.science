### Manx Folklore

Be it remembrid that one Manaman Mack Clere, a paynim, was the first
inhabitour of the ysle of Man, who by his Necromancy kept the same, that
when he was assaylid or invaded he wold rayse such mystes by land and
sea that no man might well fynde owte the ysland, and he would make one
of his men seeme to be in nombre a hundred.-*The Landsdowne MSS*.

THE following paper exhausts no part of the subject: it simply embodies
the substance of my notes of conversations which I have had with Manx
men and Manx women, whose names, together with such other particulars as
I could get, are in my possession . I have mostly avoided reading up the
subject in printed books; but those who wish to see it exhaustively
treated may be directed to Mr. Arthur W. Moore's book on *The Folklore
of the Isle of Man*, to which may now be added Mr. C. Roeder's
*Contributions to the Folklore of the Isle of Man* in the *Lioar
Manninagh* for 1897, pp. 129-91.

For the student of folklore the Isle of Man is very fairly stocked with
inhabitants of the imaginary order. She has her fairies and her giants,
her mermen and brownies, her kelpies and water-bulls. The water-bull or
tarroo ushtey, as he is called in Manx, is a creature about which I have
not been able to learn much, but he is described as a sort of bull
disporting himself about the pools and swamps. For instance, I was told
at the village of Andreas, in the flat country forming the northern end
of the island, and known as the Ayre, that there used to be a *tarroo
ushtey* between Andreas and the sea to the west: it was before the
ground had been drained as it is now. And an octogenarian captain at
Peel related to me how he had once when a boy heard a *tarroo ushley*:
the bellowings of the brute made the ground tremble, but otherwise the
captain was unable to give me any very intelligible description. This
bull is by no means of the same breed as the bull that comes out of the
lakes of Wales to mix with the farmers' cattle, for there the result
used to be great fertility among the stock, and an overflow of milk and
dairy produce, but in the Isle of Man the tarroo ushtey only begets
monsters and strangely formed beasts.

The kelpie, or, rather, what I take to be a kelpie, was called by my
informants a *glashtyn*; and Kelly, in his Manx Dictionary, describes
the object meant as 'a goblin, an imaginary animal which rises out of
the water.' One or two of my informants confused the *glashtyn* with the
Manx brownie. On the other hand, one of them was very definite in his
belief that it had nothing human about it, but was a sort of grey colt,
frequenting the banks of lakes at night, and never seen except at night.
Mermen and mermaids disport themselves on the coasts of Man, but I have
to confess that I have made no careful inquiry into what is related
about them; and my information about the giants of the island is equally
scanty. To confess the truth, I do not recollect hearing of more than
one giant, but that was a giant: I have seen the marks of his huge hands
impressed on the top of two massive monoliths. They stand in a field at
Balla Keeill Pherick, on the way down from the Sloc to Colby. I was told
there were originally five of these stones standing in a circle, all of
them marked in the same way by the same giant as he hurled them down
there from where he stood, miles away on the top of the mountain called
Cronk yn Irree Laa. Here I may mention that the Manx word for a giant is
*foawr*, in which a vowel-flanked *m* has been spirited away, as shown
by the modern Irish spelling, *fomhor*. This, in the plural in old
Irish, appears as the name of the Fomori, so well known in Irish legend,
which, however, does not always represent them as giants, but rather as
monsters. I have been in the habit of explaining the word as meaning
*submarini*; but no more are they invariably connected with the sea. So
another etymology recommends itself, namely, one which comes from Dr.
Whitley Stokes, and makes the *mor* in *fomori* to be of the same origin
as the mare in the English nightmare, French cauche*mar*, German *mahr*,
'an elf,' and cognate words. I may mention that with the Fomori of
mythic origin have doubtless been confounded and identified certain
invaders of Ireland, especially the Dumnonians from the country between
Galloway and the mouth of the Clyde, some of whom may be inferred to
have coasted the north of Ireland and landed in the West, for example in
Erris, the north-west of Mayo, called after them *Irrus* (or Erris)
*Domnann*.

The Manx brownie is called the *fenodyree*, and he is described as a
hairy and apparently clumsy fellow, who would, for instance, thrash a
whole barnful of corn in a single night for the people to whom he felt
well disposed; and once on a time he undertook to bring down for the
farmer his wethers from Snaefell. When the fenodyree had safely put them
in an outhouse, he said that he had some trouble with the little ram, as
it had run three times round Snaefell that morning. The farmer did not
quite understand him, but on going to look at the sheep, he found, to
his infinite surprise, that the little ram was no other than a hare,
which, poor creature, was dying of fright and fatigue. I need scarcely
point out the similarity between this and the story of Peredur, who, as
a boy, drove home two hinds with his mother's goats from the forest: he
owned to having had some trouble with the goats that had so long run
wild as to have lost their horns, a circumstance which had greatly
impressed him \[a\]. . To return to the fenodyree, I am not sure that
there were more than one in Man--I have never heard him spoken of in the
plural; but two localities at least are assigned to him, namely, a; farm
called Ballachrink, in Colby, in the south, and a farm called Lanjaghan,
in the parish of Conchan, near Douglas. Much the same stories, however,
appear to be current about him in the two places, and one of the most
curious of them is that which relates how he left. The farmer so valued
the services of the fenodyree, that one day he took it into his head to
provide clothing for him. The fenodyree examined each article carefully,
and expressed his idea of it, and specified the kind of disease it was
calculated to produce. Inaword, he found that the clothes would make
head and foot sick, and he departed in disgust, saying to the farmer,
'Though this place is thine, the great glen of Rushen is not.' Glen
Rushen is one of the most retired glens in the island, and it drains
down through Glen Meay to the coast, some miles to the south of Peel. It
is to Glen Rushen, then, that the fenodyree is supposed to be gone; but
on visiting that valley in 1 892 \[b\] in quest of Manx-speaking
peasants, I could find nobody there who knew anything of him. I suspect
that the spread of the English language even there has forced him to
leave the island altogether. Lastly, with regard to the term *fenodyree*
I may mention that it is the word used in the Manx Bible of 1819 for
*satyr* in Isaiah xxxiv. 14 \[c\], where we read in the English Bible as
follows: 'The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow.' In the
Vulgate the latter clause reads*: et pilosus clamabit alter ad alterum*.
The term *fenodyree* has been explained by Cregeen in his *Manx
Dictionary* to mean one who has hair for stockings or hose. That answers
to the description of the hairy satyr, and seems fairly well to satisfy
the phonetics of the case, the words from which he derives the compound
being *fynney* \[c\], 'hair,' and *oashyr*, 'a stocking'; but as
*oashyr* seems to come from the old Norse *hosur*, the plural of *hosa*,
'hose or stocking,' the term *fenodyree* cannot date before the coming
of the Norsemen; and I am inclined to think the idea more Teutonic than
Celtic. At any rate I need not point out to the English reader the
counterparts of this hairy satyr in the hobgoblin 'Lob lie by the Fire,'
and Milton's 'Lubber Fiend,'whom he describes as one that

Basks at the fire his hairy strength,  
And crop-full out of doors he flings,  
Ere the first cock his matin rings.

Lastly, I rnay mention that Mr. Roeder has a great deal to say about the
fenodyree under the name of glashtyn; for it is difficult to draw any
hard and fast line between the glashtyn and the fenodyree, or even the
water-bull, so much alike do they seem to have been regarded. Mr.
Roeder's items of folklore concerning the glashtyns (see the *Lioar
Manninagh*, iii. 139) show that there were male and female glashtyns,
and that the former were believed to have been too fond of the women at
Ballachrink, until one evening some of the men, dressed as women,
arranged to receive some youthful glashtyns. Whether the fenodyree is of
Norse origin or not, the glashtyn is decidedly Celtic, as will be
further shown in chapter vii. Here it will suffice to mention one or two
related words which are recorded in Highland Gaelic, namely, *glaistig*,
'a shegoblin which assumes the 'form of a goat,' and *glaisrig*, a
female fairy or a goblin, half human, half beast.'

The fairies claim our attention next, and as the only other fairies
tolerably well known to me are those of Wales, I can only compare or
contrast the Manx fairies with the Welsh ones. They are called in Manx,
*sleih beggey*, or little people, and *ferrishyn*, from the English word
fairies, as it would seem. Like the Welsh fairies, they kidnap babies;
and I have heard it related how a woman in Dalby had a struggle with the
fairies over her baby, which they were trying to drag out of the bed
from her. Like Welsh fairies, also, they take possession of the hearth
after the farmer and his family are gone to bed. A man in Dalby used to
find them making a big fire in his kitchen: he would hear the crackling
and burning of the fire when nobody else could have been there except
the fairies and their friends. I said 'friends,' for they sometimes take
a man with them, and allow him to eat with them at the expense of
others. Thus, some men from the northernmost parish, Kirk Bride, went
once on a time to Port Erin, in the south, to buy a supply of fish for
the winter, and with them went a Kirk Michael man who had the reputation
of being a *persona grata* to the fairies. Now one of the Port Erin men
asked a man from the north who the Michael man might be: he was curious
to know his name, as he had seen him once before, and on that oc:casion
the Michael man was with the fairies at his house-the Port Erin man's
househelping himself to bread and cheese in company with the rest. As
the fairies were regaling themselves in this instance on ordinary bread
and cheese at a living Manxman's expense, the story may perhaps be
regarded as not inconsistent with one mentioned by Cumming \[e\] to the
following effect:--A man attracted one night as he was crossing the
mountains, by fairy music, entered a fairy hall where' a banquet was
going on. He noticed among them several faces which he seemed to know,
but no act of mutual recognition took place till he had some drink
offered him, when one of those whom he seemed to know warned him not to
taste of the drink if he had any wish to make his way home again. If he
partook of it he would become like one of them. So he found an
opportunity for spilling it on the ground and securing the cup;
whereupon the hall and all its inmates instantaneously vanished. On this
I may remark that it appears to have been a widely spread belief, that
no one who had partaken of the food for spirits \[08\] would be allowed
to return to his former life, and some instanc:es will be found
mentioned by Professor Tylor in his *Primitive Culture*, ii. 50-2.

Like the Welsh fairies, the Manx ones take men away with them and detain
them for years. Thus a Kirk Andreas man was absent from his people for
four years, which he spent with the fairies. He could not tell how he
returned, but it seemed as if, having been unconscious, he woke up at
last in this world. The other world, however, in which he was for the
four years was not far away, as he could see what his brothers and the
rest of the family were doing every day, although they could not see
him. To prove this, he mentioned to them how they were occupied on such
and such a day, and, among other things, how they took their corn on a
particular day to Ramsey. He reminded them also of their having heard a
sudden sharp crack as they were passing by a thorn bush he named, and
how they were so startled that one of them would have run back home. He
asked them if they remembered that, and they said they did, only too
well. He then explained to them the meaning of the noise, namely, that
one of the fairies with whom he had been galloping the whole time was
about to let fly an arrow at his brothers, but that as he was going to
do this, he (the missing brother) raised a plate and intercepted the
arrow: that was the sharp noise they had heard. Such was the account he
had to give of his sojourn in Faery. This representation of the world of
the fairies, as contained within the ordinary world of mortals, is very
remarkable; but it is not a new idea, as we seem to detect it in the
Irish story of the abduction of Conla \[09\] Ruad \[f\]: the fairy who
comes to fetch him tells him that the folk of Tethra, whom she
represents, behold him every day as he takes part in the assemblies of
his country and sits among his friends. The commoner way of putting it
is simply to represent the fairies as invisible to mortals at will; and
one kind of Welsh story relates how the mortal midwife accidentally
touches her eyes, while dressing a fairy baby, with an ointment which
makes the fairy world visible to her: see pp. 63,213, above.

Like Welsh fairies, the Manx ones had, as the reader will have seen,
horses to ride; they had also dogs, just as the Welsh ones had. This I
learn from another story, to the effect that a fisherman, taking a fresh
fish home, was pursued by a pack of fairy dogs, so that it was onl\~
with great trouble he reached his own door. Then he picked up a stone
and threw it at the dogs, which at once disappeared; but he did not
escape, as he was shot by the fairies, and so hurt that he lay ill for
fully six months from that day. He would have been left alone by the
fairies, I was told, if he had only taken care to put a pinch of salt in
the fish's mouth before setting out, for the Manx fairies cannot stand
salt or baptism. So children that have been baptized are, as in Wales,
less liable to be kidnapped by these elves than those that have not. I
scarcely need add that a twig of *cuirn* \[g\] or rowan is also as
effective against fairies in Man as it is in Wales. Manx fairies seem to
have been musical, like their kinsmen elsewhere; for I have heard of an
Orrisdale man crossing the neighbouring mountains at night and hearing
fairy music, which took his fancy so much that he listened, and tried to
remember it. He had, however, to return, it is said, three times to the
place before he could carry it away complete in his mind, which he
succeeded in doing at last just as the day was breaking and the
musicians disappearing. This air, I am told, is now known by the name of
the *Bollan Bane*, or White Wort. As to certain Welsh airs similarly
supposed to have been derived from the fairies, see above.

So far I have pointed out next to nothing but similarities between Manx
fairies and Welsh ones, and I find very little indicative of a
difference. First, with regard to salt, I am unable to say anything in
this direction, as I do not happen to know how Welsh fairies regard
salt: it is not improbable that they eschew salt as well as baptism,
especially as the Church of Rome has long associated salt with baptism.
There is, however, one point, at least, of difference between the
fairies of Man and of Wales: the latter are, so far as I can call to
mind, never supposed to discharge arrows at men or women, or to handle a
bow \[h\]at all, whereas Manx fairies are always ready to shoot. May we,
therefore, provisionally regard this trait of the Manx fairies as
derived from a Teutonic source? At any rate English and Scotch elves
were supposed to shoot, and I am indebted to the kindness of my
colleague, Professor Napier, for calling my attention to the Leechdoms
of Early England \[i\] for cases in point.

Now that most of the imaginary inhabitants of Man and its coasts have
been rapidly passed in review before the reader, I may say something of
others whom I regard as semi-imaginary-real human beings to whom
impossible attributes are ascribed: I mean chiefly the witches, or, as
they are sometimes called in Manx English, *butches* \[j\] \[10\]. That
term I take to be a variant of the English word *witch*, produced under
the influence of the verb *bewitch*, which was reduced in Manx English
to a form *butch*, especially if one bear in mind the Cumbrian and
Scottish pronunciation of these words, as *wutch* and *bewutch*. Now
witches shift their form, and I have heard of one old witch changing
herself into a pigeon; but that I am bound to regard as exceptional, the
regular form into which Manx witches pass at their pleasure being that
of the hare, and such a swift and thick skinned hare that no greyhound,
except a black one without a single white hair, can catch it, and no
shot, except a silver coin, penetrate its body. Both these peculiarities
are also well known in Wales. I notice a difference, however, between
Wales and Man with regard to the hare witches: in Wales only the women
can become hares, and this property runs, so far as I know, in certain
families. I have known many such, and my own nurse belonged to one of
them, so that my mother was reckoned to be rather reckless in entrusting
me to *y Gota*, or 'the Cutty One,' as she might run away at any moment,
leaving her charge to take care of itself. But I have never heard of any
man or boy of any such family turning himself into a hare, whereas in
the Isle of Man the hare witches may belong, if I may say so, to either
sex. I am not sure, however, that a man who turns himself into a hare
would be called a wizard or witch; and I recollect hearing in the
neighbourhood of Ramsey of a man nicknamed the *gaaue mwaagh*, that is
to say, 'the hare Smith,' the reason being that this particular smith
now and then assumed the form of a hare. I am not quite sure that *gaaue
mwaagh* is the name of a class, though I rather infer that it is. If so,
it must be regarded as a survival of the magic skill associated with
smiths in ancient Ireland, as evidenced, for instance, in St. Patrick's
Hymn in the eleventh or twelfth *century manuscript at Trinity College,
Dublin, known as the Liber* Hymnorum, in which we have a prayer-

Fri brichta ban ocus goband ocus druad.  
Against the spells of women, of smiths and magicians \[k\]

The persons who had the power of turning themselves into hares were
believed to be abroad and very active, together with the whole demon
world, on the eve of May-day of the Old Style. And a middle-aged man
from the parish of Andreas related to me how he came three or four times
across a woman reputed to be a witch, carrying on her evil practices at
the junction of cross-roads, or the meeting of three boundaries. This
happened once very early on Old May morning, and afterwards he met her
several times as he was returning home from visiting his sweetheart. He
warned the witch that if he found her again he would kick her: that is
what he tells me. Well, after a while he did surprise her again at work
at four crossroads, somewhere near Lezayre. She had a circle, he said,
as large as that made by horses in threshing, swept clean around her. He
kicked her and took away her besom, which he hid till the middle of the
day. Then he made the farm boys fetch some dry gorse, and he put the
witch's besom on the top of it. Thereupon fire was set to the gorse,
and, wonderful to relate, the besom, as it burned, crackled and made
reports like guns going off. In fact, the noise could be heard at
Andreas Church--that is to say, miles away. The besom had on it
'seventeen sorts of knots,' he stated, and the woman herself ought to
have been burned: in fact, he added that she did not long survive her
besom. The man who related this to me is hale and strong, living now in
the parish of Michael, and not in that of Andreas,:where he was born.

There is a tradition at St. John's, which is overlooked by the mountain
called Slieau Whallian, that witches used at one time to be punished by
being set to roll down the steep side of the mountain in spiked barrels;
but, short of putting them to death, there were various ways of
rendering the machinations of witches innocuous, or of undoing the
mischief done by them; for the charmers supply various means of meeting
them triumphantly, and in case an animal is the victim, the burning of
it always proves an effective means of bringing the offender to book: I
shall have occasion to return to this under another heading. There is a
belief that if you can draw blood, however little, from a witch, or one
who has the evil eye, he loses his power of harming you; and I have been
told that formerly this belief was sometimes acted upon. Thus, on
leaving church, for instance, the man who fancied himself in danger from
another would sidle up to him or walk by his side, and inflict on him a
slight scratch, or some other trivial wound, which elicited blood; but
this must have been a course always attended with more or less danger.

The persons able to undo the witches' work, and remove the malignant
influence of the evil eye, are known in Manx English as charmers, and
something must now be said of them, They have various ways of proceeding
to their work. A lady of about thirty-five, living at Peel, related to
me how, when she was a child suffering from a swelling in the neck, she
had it charmed away by an old woman. This charmer brought with her no
less than nine pieces of iron, consisting of bits of old pokers, old
nails, and other odds and ends of the same metal, making in all nine
pieces. After Invoking the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, she
began to rub the girl's neck with the old irons; nor was she satisfied
with that, for she rubbed the doors, the walls, and the furniture
likewise, with the metal. The result, I was assured, was highly
satisfactory, as she has never been troubled with a swelling in the
throat since that day. Sometimes a passage from the Bible is made use of
in charming, as, for instance, in the case of bleeding. One of the
verses then pronounced is Ezekiel xvi. 6, which runs thus:--'And when I
passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto
thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou
wast in thy blood, Live! This was told me by a Laxey man, who is over
seventy years of age. The methods of charming away warts are various. A
woman from the neighbourhood of St. John's explained to me how a charmer
told her to get rid of the warts on her hands. She was to take a string
and make a knot on it for every wart she had, and then tie the string
round her hand, or fingers--forget which; and I think my informant, on
her part, forgot to tell me a vital part of the formula, namely, that
the string was to be destroyed. But however that may be, she assured me
that the warts disappeared, and have never returned since. A lady at
Andreas has a still simpler method of getting rid of warts. She rubs a
snail on the warts, and then places the snail on one of the points of a
blackthorn, and, in fact, leaves the snail to die, transfixed by the
thorn; and as the snail dies the warts disappear. She has done this in
the case of her niece with complete success, so far as the wart was
concerned; but she had forgotten to notice whether the snail had also
succumbed.

The lady who in this case applied the remedy cannot be in any sense
called a charmer, however much one may insist on calling what she did a
charm. In fact, the term charmer tends to be associated with a
particular class of charm involving the use of herbs. Thus there used to
be at one time a famous charmer living near Kirk Michael, to whom the
fishermen were in the habit of resorting, and my informant told me that
he had been deputed more than once by his fellow fishermen to go to him
in consequence of their lack of success in the fishing. The charmer gave
him a packet of herbs, cut small, with directions that they should be
boiled, and the water mixed with some spirits-rum, I think-and partly
drunk in the boat by the captain and the crew, and partly sprinkled over
the boat and everything in it. The charmer clearly defined his position
in the matter to my informant. 'I cannot,' he said, 'put the fish in
your nets for you; but if there is any mischief in the way of your luck,
I can remove that for you.' The fishermen themselves had, however, more
exaggerated notions of the charmer's functions, for once on a time my
informant spent on drink for his boon companions the money which he was
to give the charmer, and then he collected herbs himselfit did not much
matter what herbs-and took them to his captain, who, with the crew, went
through the proper ritual, and made a most successful haul that night.
In fact, the only source of discontent was the charmer's not having
distributed the fish over two nights, instead of endangering their nets
by an excessive haul all in one night. They regarded him as able to do
almost anything he liked in the matter.

A lady at Andreas gave me an account of a celebrated charmer who lived
between there and the coast. He worked on her husband's farm, but used
to be frequently called away to be consulted. He usually cut up wormwood
for the people who came to him, and if there was none to be had, he did
not scruple to rob the garden of any small sprouts it contained of
cabbage or the like. He would chop them small, and give directions about
boiling them and drinking the water. He usually charged any one leaving
him to speak to nobody on the way, lest he break the charm, and this
mysteriousness was evidently an important element in his profession. But
he was, nevertheless, a thriftless fellow, and when he went to Peel, and
sent the crier round to announce his arrival, and received a good deal
of money from the fishermen, he seldom so conducted himself as to bring
much of his earnings home. He died miserably some seven or eight years
ago at Ramsey, and left a widow in great poverty. As to the present day,
the daughter of a charmer now dead is married to a man living in a
village on the southern side of the island, and she appears to have
inherited her father's reputation for charming, as the fishermen from
all parts are said to flock to her for luck. Incidentally, I have heard
in the south more than once of her being consulted in cases of sudden
and dangerous illness, even after the best medical advice has been
obtained: in fact, she seems to have a considerable practice.

In answer to my question, how the charmer who died at Ramsey used to
give the sailors luck in the fishing, my informant at Andreas could not
say, except that he gave them herbs as already described, and she
thought also that he sold them wisps to place under their pillows. I
gather that the charms were chiefly directed to the removal of supposed
impediments to success in the fishing, rather than to any act of a more
positive nature. So far as I have been able to ascertain, charming is
hereditary, and they say that it descends from father to daughter, and
then from daughter to son, and so on-a remarkable kind of descent, on
which I should be glad to learn the opinion of anthropologists. One of
the best Manx scholars in the island related to me how some fishermen
once insisted on his doing the charmer for them because of his being of
such and such a family, and how he made fools of them. It is my
impression that the charming families are comparatively few in number,
and this looks as if they descended from the family physicians or druids
of one or two chieftains in ancient times. It is very likely a question
which could be cleared up by a local man familiar with the island and
all that tradition has to say on the subject of Manx pedigrees.

In the case of animals ailing, the herbs were also resorted to; and, if
the beasts happened to be milch cows, the herbs had to be boiled in some
of their milk. This was supposed to produce wonderful results, described
as follows by a man living at a place on the way from Castletown up
South Barrule:--A farmer in his parish had a cow that milked blood, as
he described it, and this in consequence of a witch's ill-will. He went
to the charmer, who gave him some herbs, which he was to boil in the
ailing cow's milk, and the charmer charged him, whatever he did, not to
quit the concoction while it was on the fire, in spite of any noises he
might hear. The farmer went home and proceeded that night to boil the
herbs as directed, but he suddenly heard a violent tapping at the door,
a terrible lowing of the cattle in the cow-house, and stones coming down
the 'chumley': the end of it was that he suddenly fled and sprang into
bed to take shelter behind his wife. He went to the charmer again, and
related to him what had happened: he was told that he must have more
courage the next time, unless he wished his cow to die. He promised to
do his best, and this time he stood his ground in spite of the noises
and the creaking of the windows-until, in fact, a back window burst into
pieces and bodily let a witch in, who craved his pardon, and promised
nevermore to molest him or his. This all happened at the farm in
question in the time of the present farmer's grandfather. The boiling of
the charmer's herbs in milk always produces a great commotion and lowing
among the cattle, and it invariably cures the ailing ones: this is
firmly believed by respectable farmers whom I could name, in the north
of the island in particular, and I am alluding to men whom one might
consider fairly educated members of their class.

In the last mentioned instance not only is the requisite cure effected,
but the witch who caused the mischief is brought on the spot. I have
recently heard of a parallel to this in a belief which appears to be
still prevalent in the Channel Islands, more especially Guernsey. The
following incidents have been communicated to me by an ardent
folklorist, who has friends in the islands:--

An old woman in Torteval became ill, and her two sons were told that if
they tried one of the charms of divination, such as boiling certain
weeds in a pot, the first person to come to the house would prove to be
the one who had cast a spell over their mother. Accordingly they made
their bouillederie, and who should come to the door but a poor,
unoffending Breton onion seller, and as he was going away he was waylaid
by the two sons, who beat him within an inch of his life. They were
prosecuted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment; but the charming did
not come out in the evidence, though it was generally known to have been
the reason for the assault. This account was given my informant in 1898,
and the incident appears to have happened not very long before. Another
is related thus:--A certain family suffered from a plague of lice, which
they regarded as the consequence of a spell. They accordingly made their
boiling of herbs and looked for the first comer. He turned out to be a
neighbour of theirs who wished to buy some turnip seeds. The family
abused him roundly. He went away, but he was watched and caught by two
of the sons of the house, who beat him cruelly. They, on being
prosecuted, had to pay him; £5 damages. This took place in the summer of
1898, in the narrator's own parish, in Guernsey. I have also another
case of recent date, to the effect that a young woman, whose churning
was so unsuccessful that the butter would not come, boiled herbs in the
prescribed way. She awaited the first comer, and, being engaged, her
intended husband was not unnaturally the first to arrive. She abused him
so unsparingly that he broke off the engagement. These instances go far
enough to raise the question why the boiling of herbs should be supposed
to bring the culprit immediately on the spot, but they hardly go any
further, namely, to help us to answer it.

Magic takes us back to a very primitive and loose manner of thinking; so
the marvellously easy way in which it identifies any tie of association,
however flimsy, with the insoluble bond of relationship which educated
men and women regard as connecting cause and effect, renders even
simpler means than I have described quite equal to the undoing of the
evils resulting from\*the activity of the evil eye. Thus, let us suppose
that a person endowed with the evil eye has just passed by the farmer's
herd of cattle, and a calf has suddenly been seized with a serious
illness, the farmer hurries after the man of the evil eye to get the
dust from under his feet. If he objects, the farmer may, as has
sometimes been actually done, throw him down by force, take off his
shoes, and scrape off the dust adhering to their soles, and carry it
back to throw over the calf. Even that is not always necessary, as it
appears to be quite enough if he takes up dust where he of the evil eye
has just trod the ground. There are innumerable cases on folk-record of
both means proving entirely efficacious, and they remind one of a story
related in the *Itinerarium Kambriae*, i. ii, by Giraldus, as to the
archbishop when he was preaching in the neighbourhood of Haverfordwest.
A certain woman had lost her sight, but had so much faith in that holy
man that she sent her son to try and procure the least bit of the fringe
of his clothing. The youth, unable to make his way through the crowd
that surrounded the preacher, waited till it dispersed, and then took
home to his mother the sod on which he had stood and on which his feet
had left their mark. That earth was applied by her to her face and eyes,
with the result that she at once recovered her sight. A similar question
of psychology presents itself in a practice intended as a preservative
against the evil eye rather than as a cure. I allude to what I have
heard about two maiden ladies living in a Manx village which I know very
well: they are natives of a neighbouring parish, and I am assured that
whenever a stranger enters their house they proceed, as soon as he goes
away, to strew a little dust or sand over the spot where he stood. That
is understood to prevent any malignant influence resulting from his
visit. This tacit identifying of a man with his footprints may be
detected in a more precarious and pleasing form in a quaint conceit
familiar to me in the lyrics of rustic life in Wales, when, for example,
a coy maiden leaves her lovesick swain hotly avowing his perfect
readiness to cusanu ol ei thraed, that is, to do on his knees all the
stages of her path across the meadow, kissing the ground wherever it has
been honoured with the tread of her dainty foot. Let me take another
case, in which the cord of association is not so inconceivably slender,
namely, when two or more persons standing in a close relation to one
another are mistakenly treated a little too much as if mutually
independent, the objection is heard that it matters not whether it is A
or B, that it is, in fact, all the same, as they belong to the same
concern. In Welsh this is sometimes expressed by saying, *Yr un yw Huw
G'lyn a'I glocs*, that is, 'Hugh of the Glen and his clogs are all one.'
Then, when you speak in English of a man 'standing in another's shoes,'
I am by no means certain, that you are not employing an expression which
meant something more to those who first used it than it does to us. Our
modern idioms, with all'their straining after the abstract, are but
primitive man's mental tools adapted to the requirements of civilized
life, and they often retain traces of the form and shape which the
neolithic worker's chipping and polishing gave them.

It is difficult to arrange these scraps under any clearly classified,
headings, and now that I have led the reader into the midst of matters
magical, perhaps I may just as well go on to the mention of a few more:
I alluded to the boiling of the herbs according to the charmer's orderg,
with the result, among other things, of bringing the witch to the spot.
This is, however, not the only instance of the importance and strange
efficacy of fire. For when a beast dies on a farm, of course it dies,
according to the old-fashioned view of things as I understand it, from
the influence of the evil eye or the interposition of a witch. So if you
want to know to whom you are indebted for the loss of the beast, you
have simply to burn its carcase in the open air and watch who comes
first to the spot or who first passes by: that is the criminal to be
charged with the death of the animal, and he cannot help coming
there--such is the effect of the fire. A Michael woman, who is now about
thirty, related to me how she watched while the carcase of a bewitched
colt was burning, how sbe saw the witch coming, and how she remembers
her shrivelled face, with nose and chin in close proximity. According to
another native of Michael, a well informed middle-aged man, the animal
in question was oftenest a calf, and it was wont to be burnt whole, skin
and all. The object, according to him, is invariably to bring the
bewitcher on the spot, and he always comes; but I am not clear what
happens to him when he appears. My informant added, however, that it was
believed that, unless the bewitcher got possession of the heart of the
burning beast, he lost all his power of bewitching. He related, also,
how his father and three other men were once out fishing on the west
coast of the island, when one of the three suddenly expressed his wish
to land. As they were fishing successfully some two or three miles from
the shore, they would not hear of it. He, however, insisted that they
must put him ashore at once, which made his comrades highly indignant;
but they soon had to give way, as they found that he was determined to
leap overboard unless they complied. When he got on shore they watched
him hurrying away towards where a beast was burning in the corner of a
field.

Manx stories merge this burning in a very perplexing fashion with what
may be termed a sacrifice for luck. The following scraps of information
will make it clear what I mean:--A respectable farmer from Andreas told
me that he was driving with his wife to the neighbouring parish of Jurby
some years ago, and that on the way they beheld the carcase of a cow or
an ox burning in a field, with a woman engaged in stirring the fire. On
reaching the village to which they were going, they found that the
burning beast belonged to a farmer whom they knew. They were further
told it was no wonder that the said farmer had one of his cattle burnt,
as several of them had recently died. Whether this was a case of
sacrifice or not I cannot say. But let me give another instance: a man
whom I have already mentioned, saw at a farm nearer the centre of the
island a live calf being burnt. The owner bears an English name, but his
family has long been settled in Man. The farmer's explanation to my
informant was that the calf was burnt to secure luck for the rest of the
herd, some of which were threatening to die. My informant thought there
was absolutely nothing the matter with them, except that they had too
little food. Be that as it may, the one calf was sacrificed as a burnt
offering to secure luck for the rest of the cattle. Let me here also
quote Mr. Moore's note in his *Manx Surnames*, p. 184, on the place-name
*Cabbal Yn Oural Losht*, or the 'Chapel of the Burnt Sacrifice.' ' This
name,' he says, 'records a circumstance which took place in the
nineteenth century, but which, it is to be hoped, was never customary in
the Isle of Man. A farmer, who had lost a number of his sheep and cattle
by murrain, burned a calf as a propitiatory offering to the Deity on
this spot, where a chapel was afterwards built. Hence the name!
Particulars, I may say, of time, place, and person, could be easily
added to Mr. Moore's statement, excepting, perhaps, as to the deity In
question: on that point I have never been informed, but Mr. Moore was
probably right in the use of the capital *d*, as the sacrificer was,
according to all accounts, a devout Christian. I have to thank Sir
Frederick Pollock for calling my attention to a parallel this side of
the sea: he refers me to Worth's *History of Devonshire* (London, 1886),
p. 339, where one reads the following singular passage:--' Living
animals have been burnt alive in sacrifice within memory to avert the
loss of other stock. The burial of three puppies " brandise-wise " in a
field is supposed to rid it of weeds.' The second statement is very
curious, and the first seems to mean that preventive sacrifices have
been performed in Devonshire within the memory of men living in the
author's time.

One more Manx instance: an octogenarian woman, born in the parish of
Bride, and now living at Kirk Andreas, saw, when she was a 'lump of a
girl' of ten or fifteen years of age, a live sheep being burnt in a
field in the parish of Andreas, on May-day, whereby she meant the first
of May reckoned according to the Old Style. She asserts \[l\] very
decidedly that it was *son oural*, 'for a sacrifice,' as she put it, and
'for an object to the public': those were her words when she expressed
herself in English. Further, she made the statement that it was a custom
to burn a sheep on Old May-day for a sacrifice. I was fully alive to the
interest of this evidence, and cross-examined her so far as her age
allows of it, and I find that she adheres to her statement with all
firmness, but I distinguish two or three points in her evidence: (1). I
have no doubt that she saw, as she was passing by a certain field on the
borders of Andreas parish, a live sheep being burnt on

Old May-day. (2). But her statement that it was son oural, or as a
sacrifice, was probably only an inference drawn by her, possibly years
afterwards, on hearing things of the kind discussed- 3. Lastly, I am
convinced that she did hear the May-day sacrifice discussed, both in
Manx and in English: her words, 'for an object to the public,' are her
imperfect recollection of a phrase used in her hearing by somebody more
ambitious of employing English abstract terms than she is; and the
formal nature of her statement in Manx, that it was customary on May-day
to burn as a sacrifice one head of sheep *(Laa Boaldyn va cliaghtey dy
lostey son oural un baagh keyrragh*), produces the same impression on my
mind, that she is only repeating somebody else's words. I mention this
more especially as I have failed to find anybody else in Andreas or
Bride, or indeed in the whole island, who will now confess to having
ever heard of the sheep sacrifice on Old May-day.

The time assigned to the sheep sacrifice, namely May-day, leads me to
make some remarks on the importance of that day among the Celts. The day
meant is, as I have already said, Old May-day, in Manx *Shenn Laa
Boaldyn*, the *belltaine* of Cormac's *Glossary*, Scotch Gaelic
*bealtuinn*. This was a day when systematic efforts were made to protect
man and beast against elves and witches; for it was then that people
carried crosses of rowan  \[11\] in their hats and placed May flowers
over the tops of their doors and elsewhere as preservatives against all
malignant influences. With the same object in view crosses of rowan were
likewise fastened to the tails of the cattle, small crosses which had to
be made without the help of a knife: I exhibited a tiny specimen at one
of the meetings of the Folk-Lore Society. Early on May morning one went
out to gather the dew as a thing of great virtue, as in other countries.
At Kirk Michael one woman, who had been out on this errand years ago,
told me that she washed her face with the dew in order to secure luck, a
good complexion, and safety against witches. The break of this day is
also the signal for setting the ling or the gorse on fire, which is done
in order to burn out the witches wont to take the form of the hare; and
guns, I am told, were freely used to shoot any game met with on that
morning. With the proper charge some of the witches were now and then
hit and wounded, whereupon they resumed the human form and remained
cripples for the rest of their lives. Fire, however, appears to have
been the chief agency relied on to clear away the witches and other
malignant beings; and I have heard of this use of fire having been
carried so far that a practice was sometimes observed-as, for example,
in Lezayre-of burning gorse, however little, in the hedge of each field
on a farm in order to drive away the witches and secure luck.

The man who told me this, on being asked whether he had ever heard of
cattle being driven through fire or between two fires on May-day,
replied that it was not known to him as a Manx custom, but that it was
an Irish one. A cattle-dealer whom he named used on May-day to drive his
cattle through fire so as to singe them a little, as he believed that
would preserve them from harm. He was an Irishman, who came to the
island for many years, and whose children are settled in the island now.
On my asking him if he knew whence the dealer came, he answered, From
the mountains over there,' pointing to the Mourne Mountains looming
faintly in the mists on the western horizon. The Irish custom known to
my Manx informant is interesting both as throwing light on the Manx
custom, and as being the continuation of a very ancient rite mentioned
by Cormac. That writer, or somebody in his name, says that *belltaine*,
May-day, was so called from the 'lucky fire,' or the 'two fires,' which
the druids of Erin used to make on that day with great incantations; and
cattle, he adds, used to be brought to those fires, or to be driven
between them, as a safeguard against the diseases of the year. Cormac
\[m\] says nothing, it will be noticed, as to one of the cattle or the
sheep being sacrificed for the sake of prosperity to the rest. However,
Scottish \[n\] May-day customs point to a sacrifice having been once
usual, and that possibly of human beings, and not of sheep as in the
Isle of Man. I have elsewhere \[o\] tried to equate these Celtic May-day
practices -with the Thargelia \[p\] of the Athenians of antiquity. The
Thargelia were characterized by peculiar rites, and among other things
then done, two adult persons were led about, as it were scapegoats, and
at the end they were sacrificed and burnt, so that their ashes might be
dispersed. Here we seem to be on the track of a very ancient Aryan
practice, although the Celtic season does not quite coincide with the
Greek one. Several items of importance for comparison here will be found
passed under careful review in a most suggestive paper by Mr. Lawrence
Gomme,'On the Method of determining theValue of Folklore as Ethnological
Data,'in the Fourth Report of the Ethnographical Survey Committee \[q\]

It is probably in some ancient May-day custom that we are to look for
the key to a remarkable place-name occurring several times in the
island: I allude to that of *Cronk yn Irree Laa*, which probably means
the Hill of the Rise of Day. This is the name of one of the mountains in
the south of the island, but it is also borne by one of the knolls near
the eastern end of the range of low hiils ending abruptly on the coast
between Ramsey and Bride parish, and quite a small knoll bears the name,
near the church of Jurby \[r\]. I have heard of a fourth instance,
which, as I learn from Mr. Philip Kermode, editor of the *Lioar
Manninagh*, is on Clay Head, near Laxey. It has been attempted to
explain it as meaning the Hill of the Watch by Day, in reference to the
old institution of Watch and Ward on conspicuous places in the island;
but that explanation is inadmissible as doing violence to the phonetics
of the words in question \[s\]. 1 am rather inclined to think that the
name everywhere refers to an eminence to which the surrounding
inhabitants resorted for a religious purpose on a particular day in the
year. I should suggest that it was to do homage to the rising sun on May
morning, but this conjecture is offered only to await a better
explanation. The next great day in the pagan calendar of the Celts is
called in Manx *Laa Lhunys*, in Irish *Lugnassad*, the assembly or fair,
which was associated with the name of the god Lug. This should
correspond to Lammas, but, reckoned as it is according to the Old Style,
it falls on the twelfth of August, which used to be a great day for
business fairs in the Isle of Man as in Wales. But for holiday making
the twelfth only suited when it happened to be a Sunday: when that was
not the case, the first Sunday after the twelfth was'fixed upon. It is
known, accordingly, as the first Sunday of Harvest, and it used to be
celebrated by crowds of people visiting the tops of the mountains. The
kind of interference to which I have alluded with regard to an ancient
holiday, is one of the regular results of the transition from Roman
Catholicism to a Protestant system with only one fixed holiday, namely,
Sunday. The same shifting has partly happened in Wales, where Lammas is
*Gwyl Awst*, or the festival of Augustus, since the birthday of
Augustus, auspiciously for him and the celebrity of his day, fell in
with the great day of the god Lug in the Celtic world. Now the day for
going up the Fan Fach mountain in Carmarthenshire was Lammas, but under
a Protestant Church it became the first Sunday in August; and even
modified in that way it could not long survive under a vigorous
sabbatarian *régime* either in Wales or Man. As to the latter in
particular, I have heard it related by persons who were present, how the
crowds on the top of South Barrule on the first Sunday of Harvest were
denounced as pagans by a preacher called William Gick, some seventy
years ago; and how another man called Paric Beg, or Little Patrick,
preaching to the crowds on Snaefell in milder terms, used to wind up the
service with a collection, which appears to have proved a speedier
method of reducing the dimensions of these meetings on the mountain
tops. Be tha t as it may, they seem to have dwindled since then to
comparative insignificance.

If you ask the reason for this custom now, for it is not yet quite
extinct, you are told, first, that it is merely to gather ling berries;
but now and then a quasi-religious reason is given, namely, that it is
the day on which jephthah's daughter went forth to bewail her virginity
'upon the mountains': somehow some Manx people make believe that they
are doing likewise. That is not all, for people who have never
themselves thought of going up the mountains on the first Sunday of
harvest or any other, will be found devoutly reading at home about
Jephthah's daughter on that day. I was told this first in the south by a
clergyman's wife, who, finding a woman in the parish reading the chapter
in question on that day, asked the reason for her fixing on that
particular portion of the Bible. She then had the Manx view of the
matter fully explained to her, and she has since found more information
about it, and so have I. It is needless for me to say that I do not
quite understand how jephthah's daughter came to be introduced: perhaps
it is vain to look for any deeper reason than that the mention of the
mountains may have served as a sort of catch-word, and that as the Manx
people began to cease from visiting the tops of the mountains annually,
it struck the women as the next best thing for them to read at home of
one who did 'go up and down upon the mountains': they are great readers
of the Bible generally. In any case we have here a very curious instance
of a practice, originally pagan, modifying itself profoundly to secure a
new lease of life.

Between May-day and November eve, there was a day of considerable
importance in the island; but the fixing on it was probably due to
influence other than Celtic: I mean Midsummer Eve, or St. john's.
However, some practices connected with it would seem to have been of
Celtic origin, such as 'the bearing of rushes to certain places called
Warrefield and Maine on Midsummer Even." Warrefield was made in Manx
into *Barrule*, but *Mame*, 'the *jugum*, or ridge,' has not been
identified. The Barrule here in question was South Barrule, and it is to
the top of that mountain the green rushes were carried, according to
Manx tradition, as the only rent or tax which the inhabitants paid,
namely, to Manann.An mac Lir (called in Welsh Manawyc-tan ab Llyr), whom
the same tradition treats as father and founder, as king and chief
wizard of the Isle of Man, the same Manannan who is quaintly referred to
in the illiterate passage at the head of this chapter \[t\]. . As
already stated, the payment of the annual rent of rushes is associated
with Midsummer Eve; but it did not prevent the top of South Barrule from
being visited likewise later in the year. Perhaps it may also be worth
while mentioning, with regard to most of the mountains climbed on the
first Sunday of Harvest, that they seem to have near the summit of each
a well of some celebrity, which- appeairs to be the goal of the
visitors' peregrinations. This is the case with South Barrule, the
spring near the top of -which cannot, it is said, be found when sought a
second time; also with Snaefell and with Maughold Head, which boasts one
of the most famous springs in the island. When I visited it last summer
in company with Mr. Kermode, we found it to contain a considerable
number of pins, some of which were bent, and many buttons. Some of the
pins were not of a kind usually carried by men, and most of the buttons
decidedly belonged to the dress of the other sex.

Several people who had resorted many years ago to St. Maughold's Well,
told me that the water is good for sore eyes, and that after using it on
the spot, or filling a bottle with it to take home, one was wont to drop
a pin or bead or button into the well. But it had its full virtue only
when visited the first Sunday of Harvest, and that only during the hour
when the books were open at church, which, shifted back to Roman
Catholic times, means doubtless the hour when the priest was engaged in
saying Mass. Compare the passage in the *Mabinogi* of Math, where it is
said that the spear required for the slaying of Llew Llawgyffes had to
be a whole year in the making: the work was to be pursued only so long
as one was engaged at the sacrifice on Sunday *(ar yr aberth du6 slul*):
see the Oxford *Mabinogion*, p. 76. To return to Man, the restriction,
as might be expected, is not peculiar to St. Maughold's Well: I have
heard \~f it in connexion with other wells, such as Chibbyr Lansh in
Lezayre parish, and with a well on Sheau Maggyl, in which some Kirk
Michael people have a great belief. But even sea water was believed to
have considerable virtues if you washed in it while the books were open
at church, as I was told by a woman who had many years ago repeatedly
taken her own sister to divers wells and to the sea during the service
on Sunday, in order to have her eyes cured of a chronic weakness.

The remaining great day in the Celtic year is called *Sauin* or *Laa
Houney*., in Irish, *Samhain*, genitive *Samhna*. The Manx call it in
English *Hollantide*, a word derived from the English *All hallowen
tide*, 'the Season of All Saints \[u\].' This day is also reckoned in
Man according to the Old Style, so that it is our twelfth of November.
That is the day when  the tenure of land terminates, and when servant
men go to their places. In other words, it is the beginning of a new
year; and Kelly, in his *Manx-English* *Dictionary*, has, under the word
*blein*, 'year,' the following note:--'Vallancey says the Celts began
their year with January; yet in the Isle of Man the first of November is
called New Year's day by the Mummers, who, on the eve, begin their
petition in these words: *To-night is New Year's night, Hog-unnaa* \[v\]
&c.' It is a pity that Kelly, whilst he was on this subject, did not
give the rhyme in Manx, and all the more so, as the Mummers of the
present day, if he is right, must have changed their words into Noght
oie Houney, that is to say, To-night is Sauin Night or Halloween. So I
had despaired of finding anybody who could corroborate Kelly in his
statement, when I happened last summer to find a man at Kirk Michael who
was quite familiar with this way of treating the year. I asked him if he
could explain Kelly's absurd statement-I put my question designedly in
that form. He said he could, but that there was nothing absurd in it. He
then told me how he had heard some old people talk of it: he is himself
now about sixty\~seven. He had been a farm servant from the age of
sixteen till he was twenty-six to the same man, near Regaby, in the
parish of Andreas, and he remembers his master and a near neighbour of
his discussing the term New Year's Day as applied to the first of
November, and explaining to the younger men that it had always been so
in old times. In fact, it seemed to him natural enough, as all  tenure
of land ends at that time, and as all servant men begin their service
then. I cross-examined him, without succeeding in any way in shaking his
evidence. I should have been glad a few years ago to have come across
this piece of information, or even Kelly's note, when I was discussing
the Celtic year and trying to prove \[w\] that it began at the beginning
of winter, with May-day as the beginning of its second half.

One of the characteristics of the beginning of the Celtic year with the
commencement of winter was the belief that indications can be obtained
on the eve of that day regarding the events of the year; but with the
calendar year gaining ground it would be natural to expect that the
Calends of January would have some of the associations of the Calends of
Winter transferred to them, and vice versa. In fact, this can, as it
were, be watched now going on in the Isle of Man. First, I may mention
that the Manx mummers used to go about singing, in Manx, a sort of
Hogmanay song \[x\], reminding one of that usual in Yorkshire and other
parts of Great Britain, and now known to be of Romance origin \[y\]

The time for it in this country was New Year's Eve, according to the
ordinary calendar, but in the Isle of Man it has always been Hollantide
Eve, according to the Old Style, and this is the night when boys now go
about continuing the custom of the old mummers. There is no hesitation
in this case between Hollantide Eve and New Year's Eve. But with the
prognostications for the year it is different, and the following
practices have been usual. I may, however, premise that as a rule I have
abstained from inquiring too closely whether they still go on, but here
and there I have had the information volunteered that they do.

(1). I may mention first a salt prognostication, which was described to
me by a farmer in the north, whose wife practises it once a year
regularly. She carefully fills a thimble with salt in the evening and
upsets it in a neat little heap on a plate: she does that for every
member of the family, and every guest, too, if there happen to be any.
The plate is then left undisturbed till the morning, when she examines
the heaps of salt to see if any of them have fallen; for whoever is
found represented by a fallen heap will die during the year. She does
not herself, I am assured, believe in it, but she likes to continue a
custom which she has learned from her mother.

(2). Next may be mentioned the ashes being carefully swept to the open
hearth, and nicely flattened down by the women just before going to bed.
In the morning they look for footmarks on the hearth, and if they find
such footmarks directed towards the door, it means, in the course of the
year, a death in the family, and if the reverse, they expect an addition
to it by marriage \[z

(3). Then there is an elaborate process of eavesdropping recommended to
young women curious to know their future husbands' names: a girl would
go with her mouth full of water and her hands full of salt to the door
of the nearest neighbour's house, or rather to that of the nearest
neighbour but one-I have been carefully corrected more than once on that
point. There she would listen, and the first name she caught would prove
to be that of her future husband. Once a girl did so, as I was told by a
blind fisherman in the south, and heard two brothers quarrelling inside
the house at whose door she was listening. Presently the young men's
mother exclaimed that the devil would not let Tom leave John alone. At
the mention of that triad the girl burst into the house, laughing and
spilling the mouthful of water most incontinently. The end of it was
that before the year was out she married Tom, the second person
mentioned: the first either did not count or proved an unassailable
bachelor.

\(4\) There is also a ritual for enabling a girl to obtain other
information respecting her future husband: vessels placed about the room
have various things put into them, such as clean water, earth, meal, a
piece of a net, or any other article thought appropriate. The candidate
for matrimony, with her eyes bandaged, feels her way about the house
until she puts her hand in one of the aforesaid vessels. If what she
lays her hand on is the clean water, her husband will be a handsome man
\[aa\]--if it is the earth, he will be a farmer; if the meal, a miller;
if the net, a fisherman; and so on into as many of the walks of life as
may be thought worthy of consideration.

(5). Lastly, recourse may be had to a ritual of the same nature as that
observed by the druid of ancient Erin, when, burdened with a heavy meal
of the flesh of a red pig, he laid him down for the night in order to
await a prophetic dream as to the manner of man the nobles of Erin
assembled at Tara were to elect to be their king. The incident is given
in the story of Cuchulainn's Sick-bed; and the reader, doubtless, knows
the passage about Brian and the *taghairin* in the fourth Canto of
Scott's *Lady of the Lake*. But the Manx girl has only to eat a salt
herring, bones and all, without drinking or uttering a word, and to
retire backwards to bed. When she sleeps and dreams, she will behold her
future husband approaching to give her drink.

Probably none of the practices which I have enumerated, or similar ones
mentioned to me, are in any sense peculiar to the Isle of Man; but what
interests me in them is the divided opinion as to the proper night for
them in the year. I am sorry to say that I have very little information
as to the blindman's-buff ritual (No. 4); what information I have, to
wit, the evidence of two persons in the south, fixes it on Hollantide
Eve. But as to the others (Nos. 1, 2 3, 5), they are observed by some on
that night, and by others on New Year's Eve, sometimes according to the
Old Style \[ab\] and sometimes the New. Further, those who are wont to
practise the salt heap ritual, for instance, on Hollantide Eve, would be
very indignant to hear that anybody should think New Year's Eve the
proper night, and vice versa. So by bringing women bred and born in
different parishes to compare notes on this point, I have witnessed
arguing hardly less earnest than that which characterized the ancient
controversy between British and Italian ecclesiastics as to the proper
time for keeping Easter. I have not been able to map the island
according to the practices prevalent at Hollantide and the beginning of
January, but local folklorists could probably do it without much
difficulty. My impression, however, is that January is gradually
acquiring the upper hand. In Wales this must have been decidedly helped
by the inhuence of Roman rule and Roman ideas; but even there the
adjuncts of the Winter Calends have never been wholly transferred. to
the Calends of January. Witness, for instance, the women who used to
congregate in the parish church to discover who of the parishioners
would die during the year \[ac\] That custom, in the neighbourhoods
reported to have practised it, continued to attach itself to the last,
so far as I know, to the beginning of November. In the Isle of Man the
fact of the ancient Celtic year having so firmly held its own, seems to
point to the probability that the year of the Pagan Norsemen pretty
nearly coincided with that of the Celts \[ad\]. For there are reasons to
think, as I have endeavoured elsewhere to show, that the Norse Yule was
originally at the end of summer or the commencement of winter, in other
words, the days afterwards known as the Feast of the Winter Nights. This
was the favourite date in Iceland for listening to soothsayers
prophesying with regard to the winter then beginning. The late Dr.
Vigfusson had much to say on this subject, and how the local sibyl,
resuming her elevated seat at the opening of each successive winter,
gave the author of the *Volospa* his plan of that remarkable poem, which
has been described by the same authority as the highest spiritual effort
of the heathen muse of the North.

comparisons of the incident see Nutt's *Holy Grail*, p. 154 el seq.; and
Rhys' *Arthurian Legend*, pp. 75-6. A more exact parallel, however, is
to be mentioned in the next chapter.

\[b\]This chapter was written mostly in 1891.

\[c\]The spelling there used is *phynnodderee*, to the perversity of
which Cregeen calls aittiention in his *Dictionary*. In any case the
pronunciation is always approximately *fun-ó-dur*- or *fun-ód-ri*, with
the accent on the second syllable.

\[d\] I am inclined to think that the first part of the word *fenodyree*
is not *fynney*, the Manx word for' hair,'but the Scandinavian word
which survives in the Swedish. *ffun*, 'down.' Thus *ffun-hosur* (for
the *ffun-hosa* suggested by analogy) wouild explain the word
*fenodyree*, except its final *ee*, which is obscure. Compare also the
magic breeks called *fenn-brwkt*, as to which see Vigfusson's
*lcelandic* Did. s. v..*finnar*.

\[e\] Cumming's *Isle of Man* (London, 1848), p. 30, where he refers his
readers to Waldron's *Decription of the Isle of Man*: see pp. 28, 105.

\[f\] See Windisch's *Irische Grammatik*, p. 120.

\[g\]The Manx word for the rowan tree, incorrectly called a mountain
ash, is *cuirn*, which is in Mod. Irish *caorthann*, genitive
*caorthainn* '. Scotch Gaelic *caorunn*; but in Welsh books it is
*cerdin*, singular *cerdinnen* and in the spoken language mostly
*cerdin*, *cerding*, singular *cerdinen*, *cerdingen*. This variation
seems to indicate that these words have possibly been borrowed by the
Welsh from a Goidelic source; but the berry is known in Wales by the
native name of *criafol*, from which the wood is frequently called,
especially in North Wales, coed criafol, singular *coeden giafol* or
*pren criafol*. The sacredness of the rowan is the key to the proper
names Mac-Cáirthinn and Der-Ch,áirtinn, with which the student of Irish
hagiology is familiar. They mean the Son and the Daughter of the Rowan
respectively, and the former occurs as *Maqui Cairatini* on an Ogam
inscribed stone recently discovered in Meath, not very far from the
Boyne.

\[h \]I am sorry to say that it never occurred to me to ask whether the
shooting was done with such modern things as guns. But Mr. Arthur Moore
assures me that it is always understood to be bows and arrows, not guns.

1864-6): see more especially vol. ii. pp. 156-7,290-1, 401; vol-iii. pp.

\[j\] Mr. Moore is not familiar with this term, but I heard it at Surby,
in the south; and I find *buidseach* and *buidseachd* given as Highland
Gaelic words for a witch and witchcraft respectively.

\[r\] It is my impression that it is crowned with a small tumulus, and
that it forms the highest ground in Jurby, which was once an island by
itself. The one between Ramsey and Bride is also probably the highest
point of the range. But these are questions which I should like to see
further examined, say by Mr. Arthur Moore or Mr. Kermode.

\[s\] *Cronk yn Irree Laa*, despite the gender, is the name as
pronounced by all Manxmen who have not been misled by antiquarians. To
convey the other meaning, referring to the day watch, the name would
have to be Cronk *ny Harrey Laa*; in fact, a part of the Howe in the
south of the island is called *Cronk ny Harrey*, 'the Hill of the
Watch.' Mr. Moore tells me that the Jurby crvnk was one of the eminences
for Watch and Ward'; but he is now of opinion that the high mountain of
Cronk yn Irree Laa in the south was not. As to the duty of the
inhabitants to keep I Watch and Ward' over the island, see the passage
concerning it extracted from the Manx Statutes (vol. i. p. 65) by Mr.
Moore in his Manx *Surnames*, pp. 182-3; also my preface to the same
work, pp. v-viii.

\[t\] Q\]uoted from Oliver's *Manumoda de Insula Manniae*, vol. i.
*(Manx Society*, vol. iv) p. 84: see also Cumming's *Isle of Man*, p.
a58.

\[u\] See the New English Dictionary, s. v. 'Allhallows.'

\[v\] This comes near the pronunciation usual in Roxburghshire and the
south of Scotland generally, which is, as Dr. Murray informs me,
*Hungamay* without the m occurring in the other forms to be mentioned
presently. But so far as I have been able to find, the Manx
pronunciation is now Hob dy naa, which I have heard in the north, while
*Hob ju naa* is the prevalent form in the south.

\[w\] See my *Hibbert Lectures*, pp. 514-5; and as to hiring fairs in
Wales see above.

\[x\] See Robert Bell's *Early Ballads* (London, 1877), pp. 406-7, where
the following is given as sung at Richmond in Yorkshire:

To-night it is the New-Year's night, to-morrow is the day,  
And we are come for our right, and for our ray,  
As we used to do in old King Henry's day.  
Sing, fellows, sing, Hagman-heigh.

If you go to the bacon-flick, cut me a good bit;  
Cut, cut and low, beware of your maw;  
Cut, cut and round, beware of your thumb,  
That me and my merry men may have some.  
Sing, fellows, sing, Hagman-heigh.

If you go to the black-ark bring me X mark;  
Ten mark, ten pound, throw it down upon the ground,  
That me and my merry men may have some.  
Sing, fellows, sing, Hagman-heigh.

\[y\] The subject is worked out in Nicholson's *Golspie*, pp. 100-8,
also in the New English Dictionary, where mention is made of a
derivation involving calendae,,which reminds me oftheWelsh call for a
New-Year's Gift-Calennig! or C'lennig! in Arfon 'Y Ngh'Iennig!' My
Calends gift ify ou please!'

\[z\] On being asked, after reading this paper to the Folk-Lore Society,
who was supposed to make the footmarks in the ashes, I had to confess
that I had been careless enough never to have asked the question. I have
referred it to Mr. Moore, who informs me that nobody, as I expected,
will venture on any explanation by whom the footmarks are made.

\[aa\] This seems to imply the application of the same adjective, some
time or other, to *clean* water and a *handsome* man, just as we speak
in North Cardiganshire of *dwr glan*, 'clean water,' and *bachgen glan*,
'a handsome boy.'

\[ab\] In Phillips' Book of Common Prayer this is called *Lá nolicky
biggy*, 'Little Nativity Day,' and *La ghian blieny*, 'The Day of the
Year's End,' meaning, of course, the former end of the year, not the
latter: see pp. 55, 62, 66.

\[ac\] See my *Hibbert Lectures*, pp. 514-5, and the *Brython*, ii. 20,
120: an instance in point occurs in the next chapter.

\[ad\] This has been touched upon in my *Hibbert Lectures*, p. 676; but
to the reasons there briefly mentioned should be added a reference to
the position allotted to intercalary months in the Norse calendar,
namely, at the end of the summer half, that is, as I think, at the end
of the ancient Norse year.
