# Chapter IX

### Place-Name Stories

The *Dindisechas* is a collection of stories (*senchasa*), in
Middle-Irish prose and verse, about the names of noteworthy places
(*dind*) in Ireland-plains, mountains, ridges, cairns, lakes, rivers,
fords, estuaries, islands, and so forth. . . . But its value to students
of Irish folklore, romance (sometimes called history), and topography
has long been recognized by competent authorities, such as Petrie,
O'Donovan, and Mr. Alfred Nutt.  
WHITLEY STOKES.

 

IN the previous chapters some folklore has been produced in which we
have swine figuring: see more especially that concerned with the Hwch Du
Gwta, above. Now I wish to bring before the reader certain other groups
of swine legends not vouched for by oral tradition so much as found in
manuscripts more or less ancient. The first three to be mentioned occur
in one of the Triads \[a\]. 1 give the substance of it in the three best
known versions, premising that the Triad is entitled that of the Three
Stout Swineherds of the Isle of Prydain:--

i\. 30a:--Drystan \[b\] son of Taffwch who guarded the swine of March
son of Meirchion while the swineherd went to bid Essyllt come to meet
him: at the same time Arthur sought to have one sow by fraud or force,
and failed.

ii\. 56 b:--Drystan son of Tallwch with the swine of March ab Meirchion
whLle the swineherd went on a message to Essyttt. Arthur and March and
Cai and Bedwyr came all four to him, but obtained from Drystan not even
as much as a single porker, whether by force, by fraud, or by theft.

iii .:101c:--The third was Trystan son of Tallwch, who guarded the swine
of March son of Meirchion while the swineherd had gone on a message to
Essyllt to bid her appoint a meeting with Trystan. Now Arthur and
Marchell and Cai and Bedwyr undertook to go and make an attempt on him,
but they proved unable to get possession of as much as one porker either
as a gift or as a purchase, whether by fraud, by force, or by theft.  
In this story the well-known love of Drystan and Essyllt is taken for
granted; but the whole setting is so peculiar and so unlike that of the
story of Tristan and Iselt or Iseut in the romances, that there is no
reason to suppose it in any way derived from the latter.  
The next portion of the Triad runs thus:--

i\. 30b:--And Pryderi son of Pwyll of Annwvyn who guarded the swine of
Pendaran of Dyfed in the Glen of the Cuch in Emlyn.

ii\. 56a:--Pryderi son of Pwyll Head of Annwn with the swine of Pendaran
of Dyfed his foster father. The swine were the seven brought away by
Pwyll Head of Annwn and given by him to Pendaran of Dyfed his foster
father; and the Glen of the Cuch was the place where they were kept. The
reason why Pryderi is called a mighty swineherd is that no one could
prevail over him either by fraud or by force \[c\].

iii\. 101a:--The first was Pryderi son of Pwyll of Pendaran in Dyfed
\[d\], who guarded his father's swine while he was in Annwn, and it was
in the Glen of the Cuch that he guarded them.

The history of the pigs is given, so to say, in the *Mabinogion*. Pwyll
had been able to strike up a friendship and even an alliance with Arawn
king of Annwvyn \[e\] or Annwn, which now means Hades or the other
world; and they kept up their friendship partly by exchanging presents
of horses, greyhounds, falcons, and any other things calculated to give
gratification to the receiver of them. Among other gifts which Pryderi
appears to have received from the king of Annwn were *hobeu* or moch,
'pigs, swine,'which had never before been heard of in the island of
Prydain. The news about this new race of animals, and that they formed
sweeter food than oxen, was not long before it reached Gwynedd; and we
shall presently see that there was another story which flatly
contradicts this part of the Triad, namely to the effect that Gwydion,
nephew of Math king of Gwynedd and a great magician, came to Pryderi's
court at Rhuddlan, near Dolau Bach or Highmead on the Teifi in what is
now the county of Cardigan, and obtained some of the swine by deceiving
the king. But, to pass by that for the present, I may say that Dyfed
seems to have been famous for rearing swine; and at the present day one
affects to believe in the neighbouring districts that the chief industry
in Dyfed, more especially in South Cardiganshire, consists in the
rearing of parsons, carpenters, and pigs. Perhaps it is also worth
mentioning that the people of the southern portion of Dyfed are
nicknamed by the men of Glamorgan to this day *Moch Sir Benfro*, 'the
Pigs of Pembrokeshire.'

But why so much importance attached to pigs? I cannot well give a better
answer than the reader can himself supply if he will only consider what
role the pig plays in the domestic economy of modem Ireland. But, to
judge from old Irish literature, it was even more so in ancient times,
as pigs' meat was so highly appreciated, that under some one or other of
its various names it usually takes its place at the head of all flesh
meats in Irish stories. This seems the case, for instance, in the
medieval story called the Vision of MacConglinne \[f\]; and, to go
further back, to the Feast of Bricriu. for instance, one finds it
decidedly the case with the Champion's Portion \[g\] at that stormy
banquet. Then one may mention the story of the fatal feast on
MacD,Ath6's great swine \[h\], where that beast would have apparently
sufficed for the braves both of Connaught and Ulster had Conall Cernach
carved fair, and not given more than their share to his own Ultonian
friends in order to insult the Connaught men by leaving them nothing but
the fore-legs. It is right, however, to point out that most of the
stories go to show, that the gourmands of ancient Erin laid great stress
on the pig being properly fed, chiefly on milk and the best kind of
meal. It cannot have been very different in ancient Wales; for we read
in the story of Peredur that, when he sets out from his mother's home
full of his mother's counsel, he comes by-and-by to a pavilion, in front
of which he sees food, some of which he proceeds to take according to
his mother's advice, though the gorgeously dressed lady sitting near it
has not the politeness to anticipate his wish. It consisted, we are
told, of two bottles of wine, two loaves of white bread, and collops of
a milk-fed pig's flesh \[i\]. The home of the fairies was imagined to be
a land of luxury and happiness with which nothing could compare in this
world. In this certain Welsh and Irish stories agree; and in one of the
latter, where the king of the fairies is trying to persuade the queen of
Ireland to elope with him, we find that among the many inducements
offered her are fresh pig, sweet milk, and ale \[j\] Conversely, as the
fairies were considered to be always living and to be a very
old-fashioned and ancient people, story in the matter of the derivation
of the pig from Annwn: see the last chapter.  
  
The next story in the Triad is, if possible, wilder still: it runs as
follows:--  
  
i. 30c:--Coll son of Collrewi \[k\] who guarded Henwen \[l\], Dallweir
Dallben's sow, which went burrowing as far as the Headland of Awstin in
Kernyw and then took to the sea. It was at Aber Torogi in Gwent Is-coed
that she came to land, with Cott keeping his grip on her bristles
whatever way she went by sea or by land. Now in Maes Gwenith, 'Wheat
Field,' in Gwent she dropped a grain of wheat and a bee, and thenceforth
that has been the best place for wheat. Then she went as far as Llonwen
in Penfro and there dropped a grain of barley and a bee, and thenceforth
Llonwen has been the best place for barley. Then she proceeded to Rhiw
Gyferthwch in Eryri and dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick. These
Coll gave away, the eagle to the Goidel Brynach from the North, and the
wolf to Menwaed of Arllechwedd, and they came to be known as Menwaed's
Wolf and Brynach's Eagle. Then the sow went as far as the Maen Du at 
Llanfair in Arfon, and there she dropped a kitten, and that kitten Colt
cast into the Menai: that came later to be known as Cath Paluc, 'Palug's
Cat.'  
  
ii. 56c:--The third was Coll son of Kallureuy with the swine of Daffwyr
Daltben in Dallwyr's Glen in Kernyw. Now one of the swine was with young
and Henwen was her name; and it was foretold that the Isle of Prydain
would be the worse for her litter; and Arthur collected the host of
Prydain and went about to destroy it. Then one sow went burrowing, and
at the Headland of Hawstin in Kernyw she took to the sea with the
swineherd following her. And in Maes Gwenith in Gwent she dropped a
grain of wheat and a bee, and ever since Maes Gwenith is the best place
for wheat and bees. And at Llonyon in Penfro she dropped a grain of
barley and another of wheat: therefore the barley of Llonyon has passed
into a proverb. And on Rhiw Gyferthwch in Arfon she dropped a wolf-cub
and an eagle-chick. The wolf was given to Mergaed and the eagle to Breat
a prince from the North, and they were the worse for having them. And at
Manfair in Arfon, to wit below the Maen Du, she dropped a kitten, and
from the Maen Du the swineherd cast it into the sea, but the sons of
Paluc reared it to their detriment. It grew to be Cath Paluc, 'Palug's
Cat,' and proved one of the three chief molestations of Mona reared in
the island: the second was Daronwy and the third was Edwin king of
England.  
  
iii. 101b:--The second was Coff son of Colffrewi who guarded Dalwaran
Dallben's sow, that came burrowing as far as the Headland of Penwedic in
Kernyw and then took to the sea; and she came to land at Aber Tarogi in
Gwent Is-coed with Colt keeping his hold of her bristles whithersoever
she went on sea or land. At Maes Gwenith in Gwent she dropped three
grains of wheat and three bees, and ever since Gwent has the best wheat
and bees. From Gwent she proceeded to Dyfed and dropped a grain of
barley and a porker, and ever since Dyfed has the best barley and pigs:
it was in Llonnio Llonnwen these were dropped. Afterwards she proceeded
to Arfon (*sic*) and in Lleyn she dropped the grain of rye, and ever
since Lleyn and Eifionyd have the best rye. And on the side of Rhiw
Gyferthwch she dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick. Colt gave the
eagle to Brynach the Goidel of Dinas Affaraon, and the wolf to Menwaed
lord of Arltechwedd, and one often hears of Brynach's Wolf and Menwaed's
Eagle, \[the writer was careless: he has made the owners exchange
pests\]. Then she went as far as the Maen Du in Arfon, where she dropped
a kitten and Coll cast it into the Menai. That was the Cath Balwg
(*sic*), 'Palug's Cat': it proved a molestation to the Isle of Mona
subsequently.  
  
Such are the versions we have of this story, and a few notes on the
names seem necessary before proceeding further. Coll is called Coll son
of Collurewy in i. 3o, and Coll son of Kallureuy in ii. 56: all that is
known of him comes from other Triads, i. 32-3, ii. 20, and iii. 90. The
first two tell us that he was one of the Three chief Enchanters of the
Isle of Prydain, and that he was taught his magic by RhuddIwin the Giant
learnt his magic from Eidd\[il\]ig the Dwarf and from Coll son of
Collfrewi. Nothing is known of Dallwyr's Glen in Kernyw, or of the
person after whom it was named. Kernyw is the Welsh for Cornwall, but if
Penryn Awstin or Hawstin is to be identified with Aust Cliff on the
Severn Sea in Gloucestershire, the story would seem to indicate a time
when Cornwall extended north-eastwards as far as that point. The later
Triad, iii. ioi, avoids Penryn Awstin and substitutes Penweddic, which
recalls some such a name as Pengwaed \[m\] or Penwith in Cornwall:
elsewhere Penweddic \[n\] is only given as the name of the most northern
hundred of Keredigion. Gwent Is-coed means Gwent below the Wood or
Forest, and Aber Torogi or Tarogi-omitted, probably by accident, in ii.
56--is now Caldicot Pill, where the small river Tarogi, now called
Troggy, discharges itself not very far from Portskewet. Maes Gwenith in
the same neighbourhood is still known by that name. The correct spelling
of the name of the place in Penfro was probably Llonyon, but it is
variously given as ILonwen, Llonyon, and Llonion, not to mention the
Llonnio, Llonnwen of the later form of the Triad: should this last prove
to be based on any authority one might suggest Llonyon Henwen, so called
after the sow, as the original. The modern Welsh spelling of Llonyon
would be Llonion, and it is identified by Mr. Egerton Phillimore with
Lanion near Pembroke \[o\] . Rhiw Gyferthwch \[19\] is guessed to have
been one of the slopes of Snowdon on the Bedgelert side; but I have
failed to discover anybody who has ever heard the name used in that
neighbourhood.

Arllechwedd was, roughly speaking, that part of Carnarvonshire which
drains into the sea between Conway and Bangor. Brynach and Menwaed or
Mengwaed \[p\] seem to be the names underlying the misreadings in ii.
56; but it is quite possible that Brynach, probably for an Irish
Bronach, has here superseded an earlier Urnach or Eurnach also a Goidel,
to whom I shall have to return in another chapter. Dinas Affaraon \[q\]
is the place called *Dinas Ffaraon Dande* in the story of Llud and
Llevelys, where we are told that after Llud had had the two dragons
buried there, which had been dug up at the centre of his realm, to wit
at Oxford, Ffaraon, after whom the place was called, died of grief.
Later it came to be called Dinas Emrys from Myrddin Emrys, 'Merlinus
Ambrosius,' who induced Vortigern to go away from there in quest of
another place to build his castle \[r\]. So the reader will see that the
mention of this Dinas brings us back to a weird spot with which he has
been familiarized in the previous chapter: see above. Llanfair in Arfon
is Llanfair Is-gaer near Port Dinorwic on the Menai Straits, and the
Maen Du should be a black rock or black stone on the southern side of
those straits. Daronwy and Cath Paluc are both personages on whom light
is still wanted. Lastly, by Edwin king of England is to be understood
Edwin king of the Angles of Deira and Bernicia, whom Welsh tradition
represents as having found refuge for a time in Anglesey.

Now this story as a whole looks like a sort of device for stringing
together explanations of the origin of certain place-names and of
certain local characteristics. Leaving entirely out of the reckoning the
whole of Mid-Wales, that is to say, the more Brythonic portion of the
country, it is remarkable as giving to South Wales credit for certain
resources, but to North Wales for pests alone and scourges, except that
the writer of the late version bethought himself of Lleyn and EifionddI
as having good land for growing rye; but he was very hazy as to the
geography of North Wales--both he and the redactors of the other Triads
equally belonged doubtless to South Wales. Among the place-names, Maes
Gwenith, 'the Wheat Field,' is clear; but hardly less so is the case of
Aber Torogi, ' Mouth of the Troggy,' where *torogi* is 'the pregnancy of
animals, 'from *torrog*, 'being with young.' So with Rhiw Gyferthwch,
'the Hillside or Ascent of *Cyferthwch*,' where *cyferthwch* means '
pantings, pangs, labour.' The name Maen Du, 'Black Rock,' is left to
explain itself; and I am not sure that the original story was not so put
as also to explain ff-onion, to wit, as a sort of plural of llawn,
'full,' in reference, let us say, to the full ears of the barley grown
there. But the reference to the place-names seems to have partly escaped
the later tellers of the story or to have failed to impress them as
worth emphasizing. They appear to have thought more of explaining the
origin of Menwaed's Wolf and Brynach's Eagle. Whether this means in the
former case that the district of ArItechwe(I was more infested by wolves
than any other part of Wales, or that Menwaed, lord of Artlechwed, had a
wolf as his symbol, it is impossible to say.

In another Triad, however, i. 23 = ii- 57, he is reckoned one of the
Three Battle-knights who were favourites at Arthur's court, the others
being Caradog Freichfras and Llyr Llfuddog or Lludd Llurugog, while in
iii. 29 Menwaed's place is taken by a son of his called Mael Hir.
Similarly with regard to Brynach's Eagle one has nothing to say, except
that common parlance some time or other would seem to have associated
the eagle in some way with Brynach the Goidel. The former prevalence of
the eagle in the Snowdon district seems to be the explanation of its
Welsh name of Eryri-as already suggested above--and the association of
the bird with the Goidelic chieftain who had his stronghold under the
shadow of Snowdon seems to follow naturally enough. But the details are
conspicuous by their scarcity in Welsh literature, though Brynach's
Eagle is probably to be identified with the *Aquila Fabulosa* of Eryri,
of which Giraldus makes a curious mention \[s\]. Perhaps the final
disuse of Goidelic speech in the district is to be, to some extent,
regarded as accounting for our dearth of data. A change of language
involved in all probability the shipwreck of many a familiar mode of
thought; and many a homely expression must have been lost in the
transition before an equivalent acceptable to the Goidel was discovered
by him in his adopted idiom.

This question of linguistic change will be found further illustrated by
the story to which I wish now to pass, namely that of the hunting of
Twrch Trwyth. It is one of those incorporated in the larger tale known
as that of Kulhwch and Olwen, the hero and heroine concerned: see the
Oxford *Mabinogion*, pp. 135-41, and Guest's translation, iii- 306-16.
Twrch Trwyth is pictured as a formidable boar at the head of his
offspring,  consisting of seven swine, and the Twrch himself is
represented as carrying between his ears a comb, a razor, and a pair of
shears. The plot of the Kulhwch renders it necessary that these precious
articles should be procured; so Kulhwch prevails on his cousin Arthur to
undertake the hunt. Arthur began by sending one of his men, to wit, Menw
\[t\] son of Teirgwaedd, to see whether the three precious things
mentioned were really where they were said to be, namely, between Twrch
Trwyth's ears. Menw was a great magician who usually formed one of any
party of Arthur's men about to visit a pagan country; for it was his
business to subject the inhabitants to magic and enchantment, so that
they should n9t see Arthur's men, while the latter sawthem. Menw found
Twrch Trwyth \[20\] and his offspring at a place in Ireland called
Esgeir Oervel \[u\], and in order to approach them he alighted in the
form of a bird near where they were. He tried to snatch one of the three
precious articles from Twrch Trwyth, but he only succeeded in securing
one of his bristles, whereupon the Twrch stood up and shook himself so
vigorously that a drop of venom from his bristles fell on Menw, who
never enjoyed a day's health afterwards as long as he lived. Menw now
returned and assured Arthur that the treasures were really about the
Twrch's head as it was reported. Arthur then crossed to Ireland with a
host and did not stop until he found Twrch Trwyth and his swine at
Esgeir Oervel. The hunt began and was continued for several days, but it
did not prevent the Twrch from laying waste a *fifth part* of Ireland,
that is in Medieval Irish *coiced*, a province of the island. Arthur's
men, however, succeeded in killing one of the Twrch's offspring, and
they asked Arthur the history \[v\] of that swine. Arthur replied that
it had been a king before being transformed by God into a swine on
account of his sins. Here I should remark by the way, that the narrator
of the story forgets the death of this young boar, and continues to
reckon the Twrch's herd as seven. Arthur's next move was to send one of
his men, Gwrhyr, interpreter of tongues \[w\], to parley with the boars.
Gwrhyr, in the form of a bird, alighted above where Twrch Trwyth and his
swine lay, and addressed them as follows: 'For the sake of Him who
fashioned you in this shape, if you can speak, I ask one of you to come
to converse with Arthur! Answer was made by one of the boars, called
Grugyn Gwrych Ereint, that is, Grugyn Silver-bristle; for like feathers
of silver, we are told, were his bristles wherever he went, and whether
in woods or on plains, one saw the gleam of his bristles. The following,
then, was Grugyn's answer: 'By Him who fashioned us in this shape, we
shall not do so, and we shall not converse with Arthur. Enough evil has
God done to us when He fashioned us in this shape, without your coming
to fight with us.' Gwrhyr replied: 'I tell you that Arthur will fight
for the comb, the razor, and the shears that are between the ears of
Twrch Trwyth.' 'Until his life has first been taken,' said Grugyn,
'those trinkets shall not be taken, and to-morrow morning we set out
hence for Arthur's own country, and all the harm we can, shall we do
there'.  
  
The boars accordingly set out for Wales, while Arthur with his host, his
horses, and his hounds, on board his ship *Prydwen*, kept within sight
of them. Twrch Trwyth came to land at Porth Clais, a small creek south
of St. David's, but Arthur went that night to Mynyw, which seems to have
been Menevia or St. David's. The next day Arthur was told that the boars
had gone past, and he overtook them killing the herds of Kynnwas
Cwrvagyl, after they had destroyed all they could find in Deugleclyf,
whether man or beast. Then the Twrch went as far as Presseleu, a name
which survives in that of Preselly or Precelly, as in Preselly Top and
Preselly Mountains in North Pembrokeshire. Arthur and his men began the
hunt again, while his warriors were ranged on both sides of the *Nyfer*
or the river Nevem. The Twrch then left the Glen of the Nevern and made
his way to Cwni Kerwyn, the name of which survives in that of Moel Cwm
Kerwyn, one of the Preselly heights. In the course of the hunt in that
district the Twrch killed Arthur's four champions and many of the people
of the country. He was next overtaken in a district called Peuliniauc
\[x\] or Peuliniog, which appears to have occupied a central area
between the mountains, Llanddewi Velfrey, Henllan Amgoed, and Laugharne:
it probably covered portions of the parish of Whitland and of that of
Llandysilio, the church of which is a little to the north of the railway
station of Clyn Derwen on the Great Western line. Leaving Peuliniog for
the Laugharne Burrows, he crossed, as it seems, from Ginst Point to
*Aber Towy* or Towy Mouth \[y\], which at low water are separated mostly
by tracts of sand interrupted only by one or two channels of no very
considerable width; for Aber Towy would seem to have been a little
south-east of St. Ishmael's, on the eastern bank of the Towy. Thence the
Twrch makes his way to Glynn Ystu, more correctly perhaps *Clyn Ystun*,
now written *Clun Ystyn* \[z\], the name of a farm between Carmarthen
and the junction of the Amman with the Llychwr, more exactly about six
miles from that junction and about eight and a half from Carmarthen as
the crow flies. The hunt is resumed in the Valley of the Llychwr or
Loughor \[aa\], where Grugyn and another young boar, called Llwydawc
Gouynnyat \[ab\], committed terrible ravages among the huntsmen. This
brought Arthur and his host to the rescue, and Twrch Trwyth, on his
part, came to help his boars; but as a tremendous attack was now made on
him he moved away, leaving the Llychwr, and making eastwards for Mynydd
Amanw, or 'the Mountain of Amman,\[ac\] for Amanw is plentifully
preserved in that neighbourhood in the shortened form of Aman or
Amman:'. On Mynydd Amanw one of his boars was killed, but he is not
distinguished by any proper name: he is simply called a *banw*, 'a young
boar.' The Twrch was again hard pressed, and lost another called Twrch
ILawin. Then a third of the swine is killed, called Gwys, whereupon
Twrch Trwyth went to Dyffryn Amanw, or the Vale of Amman, where he lost
a banw and a benwic, a' boar' and a 'sow.' All this evidently takes
place in the same district, and MYnyd Amanw was, if not Bryn Amman,
probably one of the mountains to the south or south-east of the river
Amman, so that Dyffryn Amanw may have been what is still called Dyffryn
Amman, or the Valley of the Amman from Bryn Amman to where the river
Amman falls into the Llychwr. From the Amman the Twrch and the two
remaining boars of his herd made their way to Llwch Ewin, 'the lake or
pool of Ewin, 'which is now represented by a bog mere above a farm house
called Llwch in the parish of Bettws, which covers the southern slope of
the Amman Valley. I have found this bog called in a map *Llwch is Awel*,
'Pool below Breeze,' whatever that may mean.  
  
We find them next at Llwch Tawi, the position of which is indicated by
that of *Ynys Pen Llwch*, 'Pool's End Isle,' some distance lower down
the Tawe than Pont ar Dawe. At this point the boars separate, and Grugyn
goes away to Din Tywi, 'Towy Fort,' an unidentified position somewhere
on the Towy, possibly Grongar Hill near Llandeilo, and thence to a place
in Keredigion where he was killed, namely, Garth Grugyn. I have not yet
been able to identify the spot, though it must have once had a castle,
as we read of a castle called Garthgrugyn being strengthened by Maelgwn
Vychan in the year 1242: the *Bruts* locate it in Keredigion \[ad\], but
this part of the story is obscured by careless copying on the part of
the scribe \[ae\] of the *Red Book*. After Grugyn's death we read of
Llwydawc having made his way to Ystrad Yw, and, after inflicting
slaughter on several of his assailants, he is himself killed there. Now
Ystrad Yw, which our mapsters, would have us call *Ystrad Wy*, as if it
had been on the Wye \[af\], is supposed to have covered till Henry
VIII's time the same area approximately as the hundred of Crickhowel has
since, namely, the parishes of (I) Crickhowel, (2) Llanbedr Ystrad Yw
with Patrishow, (3) ILanfihangel Cwm Du with Tretower and Penmyarth, (4)
Langattock with Llangenny, (5) Llanelly with Brynmawr, and (6)
Llangynidr. Of these ILanbedr perpetuates the name of Ystrad Yw,
although it is situated near the junction of the Greater and Lesser
Grwynd and not in the Strath of the Yw, which Ystrad Yw means. So one
can only treat *Llanbedr Ystrad Yw* as meaning that particular Llanbedr
or St. Peter's Church which belongs to the district comprehensively
called Ystrad Yw. Now if one glances at the *Red Book* list of cantreds
and cymwds, dating in the latter part of the fourteenth century, one
will find Ystrad Yw and *Cruc Howel* existing as separate cymwds. So we
have to look for the former in the direction of the parish of Cwm Du;
and on going back to the *Taxatio* of Pope Nicholas IV dating about
1291, we find that practically we have to identify with Cwm. Du a name
*Stratden'*, p. 273", which one is probably to treat as *Strat d'Eue* 
\[ag\] or some similar Norman spelling; for most of the other parishes
of the district are mentioned by the names which they still bear. That
is not all; for from Cwm Du a tributary of the Usk called the Rhiangoll
comes down and receives at Tretower the waters of a smaller stream
called the Yw. The land on both sides of that Yw burn forms the *ystrad*
or strath of which we are in quest. The chief source of this water is
called Llygad Yw, and gives its name to a house of some pretensions
bearing an inscription showing that it was built in its present form
about the middle of the seventeenth century by a member of the Gunter
family well known in the history of the county. Near the house stands a
yew tree on the boundary line of the garden, and close to its trunk, but
at a lower level, is a spring of bubbling water: this is Llygad Yw,'the
Eye of the Yw.' For Llygad Yw is a succinct expression for the source of
the Yw burn \[ah\], and the stream retains the name Yw to its fall into
the Rhiangoll; but besides the spring of Llygad Yw it has several other
similar sources in the fields near the house. There is nothing, however,
in this brook to account for the name of Ystrad Yw having been extended
to an important district; but if one traces its short course one will at
once guess the explanation. For a few fields below Llygad Yw is the
hamlet of the Gaer or fortress, consisting of four farm houses called
the Upper, Middle, and Lower Gaer, and Pen y Gaer: through this hamlet
of the Gaer flows the Yw. These, and more especially Pen y Gaer, are
supposed to have been the site of a Roman camp of considerable
importance, and close by it the Yw is supposed to have been crossed by
the Roman road proceeding towards Brecon \[ai\]. The camp in the Strath
of the Yw was the head quarters of the ruling power in the district, and
hence the application of the name of Ystrad Yw to a wider area. But for
our story one has to regard the name as confined to the land about the
Yw burn, or at most to a somewhat larger portion of the parish of Cwm
Du, to which the Yw and Tretower belong. The position of the Gaer in
Ystrad Yw at the foot of the Bwlch or the gap in the difficult mountain
spur stretching down towards the Usk is more likely to have been
selected by the Romans than by any of the Celtic inhabitants, whose
works are to be found on several of the neighbouring hills, such as
Myarth \[aj\] between the Yw and the Usk.

We next find Twrch Trwyth, now the sole survivor, making his way towards
the Severn: so Arthur summons Cornwall and Devon to meet him at Aber
Hafren or Severn mouth. Then a furious conflict with the Twrch takes
place in the very waters of that river, between Llyn Lliwan and Aber Gwy
or the mouth of the Wye. After much trouble, Arthur's men succeed in
getting possession of two out of the three treasures of the boar, but he
escapes with the third, namely, the comb, across the Severn \[ak\]. Then
as soon as he gets ashore he makes his way to Cornwall, where the comb
is at length snatched from him. Chased thence, he goes straight into the
sea, with the hounds Anet and Aethlem after him, and nothing has ever
been heard of any of the three from that day to this.  
  
That is the story of Twrch Trwyth, and Dr. Stokes calls my attention to
a somewhat similar hunt briefly described in the Rennes *Dindsenchas* in
the *Revue Celtique*, xv-  474-5. Then as to the precious articles
carried by the Twrch about his head and ears, the comb, the razor, and
the shears, two out of the three-the comb and the razor-belong to the
regular stock of a certain group of tales which recount how the hero
elopes with the daughter of a giant who loses his life in the pursuit
\[al\]. In order to make sure of escaping from the infuriated giant, the
daughter abstracts from her father's keeping a comb, a razor, and
another article. When she and her lover fleeing on their horse are hard
pressed, the latter throws behind him the comb, which at once becomes a
rough impenetrable forest to detain the giant for a while. When he is
again on the point of overtaking them, the lover throws behind him the
razor, which becomes a steep and sharp mountain ridge through which the
pursuing giant has to waste time tunnelling his way. The third article
is usually such as, when thrown in the giant's way, becomes a lake in
which he is drowned while attempting to swim across. In the Kulhwch.
story, however, as we have it, the allusion to these objects is torn
away from what might be expected as its context. The giant is Yspaddaden
Penkawr, whose death is effected in another way; but before the giant is
finally disposed of he requires to be shaved and to have his hair
dressed. His hair, moreover, is so rough that the dressing cannot be
done without the comb and shears in the possession of Twrch Trwyth,
whence the hunt; and for the shaving one would have expected the Twrch's
razor to have been requisite; but not so, as the shaving had to be done
by means of another article, namely, the tusk of *Yskithyrwynn
Pennbeidd*, 'White-tusk chief of Boars,' for the obtaining of which one
is treated briefly to another boar hunt. The Kulhwch story is in this
respect very mixed and disjointed, owing, it would seem, to the
determination of the narrator to multiply the number of things difficult
to procure, each involving a separate feat to be described.  
  
Let us now consider the hunt somewhat more in detail, with special
reference to the names mentioned; and let us begin with that of Twrch
Trwyth: the word *twrch* means the male of a beast of the swine kind,
and *twrch coed*, 'a wood pig,' is a wild boar, while *twrch daear*, 'an
earth pig,' is the word in North Wales for a mole. In the next place we
can practically equate *Twrch Trwyth* with a -name at the head of one of
the articles in Cormac's *Irish Glossary*. There the exact form is Orc
Tréith, and the following is the first part of the article itself as
given in O'Donovan's translation edited by Stokes:--*'Orc Tréith i. e.*
nomen for a king's son, *triath enim rex vocatur, unde dixit poela
Oinach n-uirc* *tréith* " fair of a king's son," i. e. food and precious
raiment, down and quilts, ale and flesh-meat, chessmen and chessboards,
horses and chariots, greyhounds and playthings besides.' In this extract
the word *orc* occurs in the genitive as *uirc*, and it means a 'pig' or
'boar'; in fact it is, with the usual Celtic loss of the consonant *p*,
the exact Goidelic equivalent of the Latin *porcus*, genitive *porci*.
From another article in Cormac's *Glossary*, we learn that *Tréith* is
the genitive of *Triath*, which has been explained to mean a king. Thus,
*Orc* *Tréith* means Triath's Orc, Triath's Boar, or the King's Boar; so
we take Twrch Trwyth in the same way to mean 'Trwyth's Boar.' But we
have here a discrepancy, which the reader will have noticed, for twrch
is not the same word as Irish *orc*, the nearest form to be expected in
Welsh being *Wrch*, not *Twrch*; but such a word as Wrch does not, so
far as I know, exist. Now did the Welsh render *orc* by a different word
unrelated to the Goidelic one which they heard? I  think not; for it is
remarkable that Irish has besides orc a word torc, meaning a 'boar,' and
*torc* is exactly the Welsh *twrch*. So there seems to be no objection
to our supposing that what Cormac calls *Orc* *Tréith* was known in the
Goidelic of Wales as *Torc* *Tréith*, which had the alliteration to
recommend it to popular favour. In that case one could say that the
Goidelic name *Torc* *Tréith* appears in Welsh with a minimum of change
as *Twrch Trwyth*, and also with the stamp of popular favour more
especially in the retention of the Goidelic *th*, just as in the name of
an ancient camp or fortification on the Withy Bush Estate in
Pembrokeshire: it is called the *Rath*, or the *Rath Ring*. Here *rath*
is identical with the Irish word *ráth*, 'a fortification or
earthworks,' and we seem to have it also in *Cil Rath Fawr*, the name of
a farm in the neighbourhood of Narberth. Now the Goidelic word tréith
appears to have come into Welsh as treth-i, the long vowel of which must
in Welsh have become *oi* or *ui* by about the end of the sixth century;
and if the *th* had been treated on etymological principles its proper
equivalent in the Welsh of that time would have been *d* or *t*. The
retention of the th is a proof, therefore, of oral transmission; that is
to say, the Goidelic word passed bodily into Brythonic, to submit
afterwards to the phonological rules of that language.

A little scrutiny of the tale will, I think, convince the reader that
one of the objects of the original story-teller was to account for
certain place-names. Thus Grugyn was meant to account for the name of
Garth Grugyn,--where Grugyn was killed; Gwys, to account similarly for
that of Gwys, a tributary of the Twrch, which gives its name to a
station on the line of railway between Ystalyfera and Bryn Amman; and
Twrch Llawin to account for the name of the river Twrch, which receives
the Gwys, and falls into the Tawe some distance below Ystrad Gynlais,
between the counties of Brecknock and Glamorgan.

Besides Grugyn and Twrch Llawin, there was a third brother to whom the
story gives a special name, to wit, Llwydawc Gouynnyat, and this was, I
take it, meant also to account for a place-name, which, however, is not
given: it should have been somewhere in Ystrad Yw, in the county of
Brecknock. Still greater interest attaches to the swine that have not
been favoured with names of their own, those referred to simply as
*banw*, 'a young boar,' and *benwic*, 'a young sow.' Now *banw* has its
equivalent in Irish in the word *banbh*, which O'Reilly explains as
meaning a 'sucking pig,' and that is the meaning also of the Manx
*bannoo*; but formerly the word may have had a somewhat wider meaning.
The Welsh appellative is introduced twice into the story of Twrch
Trwyth; once to account, as I take it, for the name Mynydd Amanw, 'Amman
Mountain,'and once for Dyffryn Amanw, 'Amman Valley.' In both instances
Amanw was meant, as I think, to be accounted for by the banw killed at
each of the places in question. But how, you will ask, does the word
banw account for Amanw, or throw any light on it at all? Very simply, if
you will just suppose the name to have been Goidelic; for then you have
only to provide it with the definite article and it makes *in banbh*,
'the pig or the boar,' and that could not in Welsh yield anything but
*ymmanw* or ammanw \[am\], which with the accent shifted backwards,
became *Ammanw* and *Amman* or *Aman*.

Having premised these explanations let us, before we proceed further,
see to what our evidence exactly amounts. Here, then, we have a mention
of seven swine, but as two of them, a *banw* and a *benwic*, are killed
at one and the same place, our figure is practically reduced to six
\[an\]. The question then is, in how many of these six cases the story
of the hunt accounts for the names of the places of the deaths
respectively, that is to say, accounts for them in the ordinary way with
which one is familiar in other Welsh stories. They may be enumerated as
follows:--

  
1. A *banw* is killed at Mynyd Amanw.  
2. A *twrch* is killed in the same neighbourhood, where there is a river
*Twrch*.  
3. A swine called *Gwys* is killed in the same neighbourhood still,
where there is a river called *Gwys*, falling into the Twrch.  
4. A *banw* and a *benwic* are killed in Dyffryn *Amanw*.  
5. Grugyn is killed at a place called Garth *Grugyn*.  
6. A swine called Llwydawc is killed at a spot, not named, in Ystrad Yw
or not far off \[ao\]

  
Thus in five cases out of the six, the story accounts for the
place-name, and the question now is, can that be a mere accident? just
think what the probabilities of the case would be if you put them into
numbers: South Wales, from St. David's to the Vale of the Usk, would
supply hundreds of place-names as deserving of mention, to say the
least, as those in this story; is it likely then that out of a given six
among them no less than five should be accounted for or alluded to by
any mere accident in the course of a story of the brevity of that of
Twrch Trwyth. To my thinking such an accident is inconceivable, and I am
forced, therefore, to suppose that the narrative was originally so
designed as to account for them. I said 'originally so designed,' for
the scribe of the *Red Book*, or let us say the last redactor of the
story as it stands in the *Red Book*, shows no signs of having noticed
any such design. Had he detected the play on the names of the places
introduced, he would probably have been more inclined to develop that
feature of the story than to efface it.

What I mean may best be illustrated by another swine story, namely, that
which has already been referred to as occurring in the *Mabinogi* of Mat
There we find Pryderi, king of Dyfed, holding his court at Rhuctlan on
the Teifi, but though he had become the proud possessor of a new race of
animals, given him as a present by his friend Arawn, king of Annwn, he
had made a solemn promise to his people, that he should give none of
them away until they had doubled their number in Dyfed: these animals
were the hobeu or pigs to which reference was made at p. 69 above. Now
Gwydion, having heard of them, visited Pryderi's court, and by magic and
enchantment deceived the king. Successful in his quest, he sets out for
Gwynect with his hobeu, and this is how his journey is described in the
Mabinogi: 'And that evening they journeyed as far as the upper end of
Keredigion, to a place which is still called, for that reason, Mochdref,
"Swine-town or Pigs' stead." On the morrow they went theirway, and came
across the Elenyd mountains, and that night they spent between Kerry and
Arwystli, in the stead which is also called for that reason Mochdref,
Thence they proceeded, and came the same evening as far as a commot in
Powys, which is for that reason called Mochnant Swine-burn.\[ap\] Thence
they journeyed to the cantred of Rhos, and spent that night within the
town which is still called Mochdref \[aq\].'  'Ah, my men,' said
Gwydion, 'let us make for the fastness of Gwyned with these beasts: the
country is being raised in pursuit of us.' So this is what they did:
they made for the highest town of Artfechwect, and there built a creu or
sty for the pigs, and for that reason the town was called Creu-Wyrion,
that is, perhaps, 'Wyrion's Sty.' In this, it is needless to state, we
have the Corwrion above--the name is variously pronounced also
*Cyrwrion* and *Crwrion*.  
  
That is how a portion of the Math story is made to account for a series
of place-names, and had the editor of the Kulhwch understood the play on
the names of places in question in the story of Twrch Trwyth, it might
be expected that he would have given it prominence, as already
suggested. Then comes the question, how it came to pass that he did not
understand it? The first thing to suggest itself as an answer is, that
he may have been a stranger to the geography of the country concerned.
That, however, is a very inadequate explanation; for his being a
stranger, though it might account for his making blunders as to the
localities, would not be likely to deter him from venturing into
geography which he had not mastered.

What was it, then, that hid from him a portion of the original in this
instance? In part, at least, it must have been a difficulty of language.
Let us take an illustration: Gwys has already been mentioned more than
once as a name applied to one of Twrch Trwyth's offspring, and the words
used are very brief, to the following effect:--'And then another of his
swine was killed: Gwys was its name.' As a matter of fact, the scribe
was labouring under a mistake, for he ought to have said rather, ' And
then another of his swine was killed: it was a sow'; since gwys was a
word meaning a sow, and not the name of any individual hog. The word
has, doubtless, long been obsolete in Welsh; but it was known to the
poet of the 'Little Pig's Lullaby' in the *Black Book of Carmarthen*,
where one of the stanzas begins, fo. 29a, with the line:

  

Oian aparchellan. aparchell. guin guis.

The late Dr. Pughe translated it thus:

Listen, little porkling! thou forward little white pig.

I fear I should be obliged to render it less elegantly:

Lullaby, little porker, white sow porker.

For the last four words Stokes suggests 'O pigling of a white sow'; but
perhaps the most natural rendering of the words would be 'O white porker
of a sow! '--which does not recommend itself greatly on the score of
sense, I must admit. The word occurs, also, in Breton as *gwys* or
*guis*,  'truie, femelle du porc,' and as *gwys* or *guis* in Old
Cornish, while in Irish it was *feis*. Nevertheless, the editor of the
Twrch Trwyth story did not know it; but it would be in no way surprising
that a Welshman, who knew his language fairly well, should be baffled by
such a word in case it was not in use in his own district in his own
time. This, however, barely touches the fringe of the question. The
range of the hunt, as already given, was mostly within the boundaries,
so to say, of the portion of South Wales where we find Goidelic
inscriptions in the Ogam character of the fifth or sixth century; and I
am persuaded that the Goideliclanguage must have lived down to the sixth
or seventh century in the south and in the north of Wales \[ar\], a
tract of Mid-Wales being then, probably, the only district which can be
assumed to have been completely Brythonic in point of speech. In this
very story, probably, such a name as Garth Grugyn is but slightly
modified from a Goidelic *Gort Grucaind*, 'the enclosure of Grucand
\[as\] or Grugan': compare Cfichulaind or Cfichulainn made in Welsh into
Cocholyn. But the capital instance in the story of Twrch Trwyth as has
already been indicated is that of Amanw, which I detect also as Ammann
(probably to be read *Ammanu*), in the *Book of Llan Dav* (or *Liber
Landavensis*), p. 199: it is there borne by a lay witness to a grant of
land called Tir Dimuner, which would appear to have been in what is now
Monmouthshire. Interpreted as standing for in Banbh, I the Boar,' it
would make a man's name of the same class as *Ibleid*, found elsewhere
in the same manuscript (pp. 178, l84), meaning evidently *i Bleid*, now
*y Blaidd*, 'the Wolf' But observe that the latter was Welsh and the
former Goidelic, which makes all the difference for our story. The
Goidel relating the story would say that a-  boar, *banbh*, was killed
on the mountain or hill of in *Banbh* or of 'the Boar'; and his Goidelic
hearer could noit fail to associate the place-name with the appellative.
But a Brython could hardly understand what the words in *Banbh* meant,
and certainly not after he had transformed them into *Ammanw*, with the
nb assimilated into mm, and the accent shifted to the first syllable. It
is needless to say that my remarks have no meaning unless Goidelic was
the original language of the tale In the summary I have given of the
hunt, I omitted a number of proper names of the men who fell at the
different spots where the Twrch is represented brought to bay. I wish
now to return to them with the question, why were their names inserted
in the story at all? It may be suspected that they also, or at any rate
some of them, were intended to explain place-names; but I must confess
to having had little success in identifying traces of them in the
ordnance maps. Others, however, may fare better, who have a better
acquaintance with the districts in point, and in that hope I append them
in their order in the story:--  
  
1. Arthur sends to the hunt on the banks of the Nevern, in
Pembrokeshire, his men, Eli and Trachmyr, Gwarthegydd son of Caw, and
Bedwyr; also *Tri meib Cledyv  Divwlch*, 'three Sons of the Gapless
Sword' The dogs are also mentioned: Drudwyn, Greid son of Eri's whelp,
led by Arthur himself; Glythmyr Ledewig's two dogs, led by Gwarthegydd
son of Caw; and Arthur's dog Cavall, led by Bedwyr.  
2. Twrch Trwyth makes for Cwm Kerwyn in the Preselly Mountains, and
turns to bay, killing the following men, who are called Arthur's four
rhyswyr \[at\] or champion s-Gwarthegyd son of Caw, Tarawg of Altt
Clwyd, Rheidwn son of Eli Atver, and Iscovan Hael.  
3. He turns to bay a second time in Cwm Kerwyn, and kills Gwydre son of
Arthur, Garselid Wydel, Glew son of Yscawt, and Iscawyn son of Bannon or
Panon.  
4. Next day he is overtaken in the same neighbourhood, and he kills
Glewlwyd Gavaelvawes three men, Huandaw, Gogigwr, and Penn Pingon, many
of the men of the country also, and Gwlydyn Saer, one of Arthur's chief
architects.  
5. Arthur overtakes the Twrch next in Peuliniauc (above); and the Twrch
there kills Madawc son of Teithion, Gwyn son of Tringad son of Neued,
and Eiriawn Pen1toran.  
6. Twrch Trwyth next turns to bay at Aber Towy, 'Towy Mouth,' and kills
Cynlas son of Cynan, and G wilenhin, king of Franc  
7. The next occasion of his killing any men whose names are given, is
when he reaches Llwch Ewin, near which he killed Echel Vorddwyd-twll,
Arwyli eil Gwyclawg Gwyr, and many men and dogs besides.  
8. Grugyn, one of the Twrch's offspring, goes to Garth Grugyn in
Keredigion with Eli and Trachmyr pursuing him; but what happened to them
we are not told in consequence of the omission mentioned above (p. 515)
as occurring in the manuscript.  
9. Llwydawc at bay in an uncertain locality kills Rudvyw Rys \[au\] and
many others.  
10. Llwydawc goes to Ystrad Yw, where he is met by the Men of Llydaw,
and he kills Hirpeissawc, king of Llydaw, also Llygatrudd Emys and
Gwrbothu Hen, maternal uncles to Arthur.  
  
By way of notes on these items, I would begin with the last by asking,
what is one to make of these Men of Llydaw? First of all, one notices
that their names are singular: thus *Hirpeissawc*, 'Long-coated or
Longrobed,' is a curious name for their king, as it sounds more like an
epithet than a name itself. Then *Llygatrwdd* (also *Llysgatrudd*, which
I cannot understand, except as as a scribal error) *Emys* is also
unusual: one would have rather expected *Emys Lygatrudd*, ' Emys the
Red-eyed.' As it stands it looks as if it meant the 'Red-eyed One of
Emys.' Moreover *Emys* reminds one of the name of Emyr Llydaw, the
ancestor in Welsh hagiology of a number of Welsh saints. It looks as if
the redactor of the Red Book had mistaken an r for an s in copying from
a pre-Norman original. That he had to work on such a manuscript is
proved by the remaining instance, Gwbothu Hen, 'G. the Ancient,' in
which we have undoubtedly a pre-Norman spelling of Gwrfoddzv: the same
redactor having failed to recognize the name, left it without being
converted  into the spelling of his own school. In the *Book of Llan
Dav* it will be found variously written *Gurbodu*, *Guoruodu*, and
*Guruodu*. Then the epithet hén, 'old or ancient,' reminds one of such
instances as Math Hén and Gofynion Hén, to be noticed a little later in
this chapter. Let us now direct the reader's attention for a moment to
the word Llydaw, in order to see whether that may not suggest something.
The etymology of it is contested, so one has to infer its meaning, as
well as one can, from the way in which it is found used. Now it is the
ordinary Welsh word for Brittany or Little Britain, and in Irish it
becomes *Letha*, which is found applied not only to Armorica but also to
*Latium*. Conversely one could not be surprised if a Goidel, writing
Latin, rendered his own *Letha* or the Welsh *Llydaw* by Latium, even
when no part of Italy was meant. Now it so happens that *Llydaw* occurs
in Wales itself, to wit in the name of 1Lyn 1Lydaw, a Snowdonian lake
already mentioned,. It is thus described by Pennant, ii. 339:--'We
found, on arriving at the top, an hollow a mile in length, filled with
Lyn Ll-ydaw, a fine lake, winding beneath the rocks, and vastly indented
by rocky projections, here and there jutting into it. In it was one
little island, the haunt of black-backed gulls, which breed here, and,
alarmed by such unexpected visitants, broke the silence of this
sequestered place by their deep screams.' But since Pennant's time
mining operations \[av\] have been carried on close to the  margin of
this lake; and in the course of them the level of the water is said to
have been lowered to the extent of sixteen feet, when, in the year 1856,
an ancient canoe was discovered there. According to the late Mr. E. L.
Barnwell, who has described it in the *Archæologia Cambrensis* for 1874,
pp. 150-1, it was in the possession of Dr. Griffith Griffith of Tal y
Treuddyn, near Harlech, who exhibited it at the Cambrian Archaeological
Association's meeting at Machyntfeth in 1866 \[\[aw\]. 'It measures,'
Mr. Barnwell says, 'nine feet nine inches-a not uncommon length in the
Scotch early canoes,-and has been hollowed out of one piece of wood, as
is universally the case with these early boats.' He goes on to surmise
that 'this canoe may have been used to reach the island, for the sake of
birds or eggs; or what is not impossible, the island may have been the
residence of some one who had reasons for preferring so isolated an
abode. It may, in fact, have been · kind of small natural crannog, and,
in one sense, veritable lake-dwelling, access to and from which was easy
by means of such a canoe.' Stokes conjectures .Lydaw to have meant
coast-land, and Thurneysen connects it with the Sanskrit *prihivi* and
Old Saxon *folda* \[ax\], 'earth': and, so far as I can see, one is at
liberty to assume a meaning that would satisfy *Llydaw*, 'Armorica,' and
the *Llydaw of Llyn Lydaw*, 'the Lake of Llydaw,' namely that it
signified land which one had to reach by boat, so that it was in fact
applicable to a lake settlement of any kind, in other words, that
*Llydaw* on Snowdon was the name of the lake-dwelling. So I cannot help
suggesting, with great deference, that the place whence came the Men of
Llydaw in the story of the hunting of Twrch Trwyth was the settlement in
Syfadon lake, and that the name of that stronghold, whether it was a
crannog or a stockaded islet, was also Llydaw. For the power of that
settlement over the surrounding country to have extended a few mLles
around would be but natural to suppose-the distance between the Yw and
Llyn Syfadon is, I am told, under three miles. Should this guess prove
well founded, we should have to scan with renewed care the allusions in
our stories to Llydaw, and not assume that they always refer us to
Brittany.

That the name Llydaw did on occasion refer to the region of Llyn
Syfaclon admits of indirect proof as follows:--The church of Llangorse
on its banks is dedicated to a Saint Paulinus, after whom also is called
Capel Peulin, in the upper course of the Towy, adjacent to the
Cardiganshire parish of Llanctewi Brefi. Moreover, tradition makes
Paulinus attend a synod in 519 at Llandewi Brefi, where St. David
distinguished himself by his preaching against Pelagianism. Paulinus was
then an old man, and St. David had been one of his pupils at the *Ty
Gwyn*, 'Whitland,'on the Taf, where Paulinus had established a religious
house \[ay\]; and some five miles up a tributary brook of the Taf is the
church of LlandysLlio, where an ancient inscription mentions a Paulinus.
These two places, Whitland and LlandysLlio, were probably in the cymwd
of Peuliniog, which is called after a Paulinus, and through which we
have just followed the hunt of Twrch Trwyth  
  
Now the inscription to which I have referred reads \[az\], with
ligatures:--\[21\]  
  
CLVTORIGI  
FLLI  PAVLINI  
MARINLLATIO

This probably means '(the Monument) of Clutorix, son of Paulinus from
Latium in the Marsh'; unless one ought rather to treat *Marini* as an
epithet to *Paulini*. In either case *Latio* has probably to be
construed '*of* or *from Latium'*: compare a Roman inscription found at
Bath (Hűbner's No. 48), which begins with *C. Murrius*. I *C. F.
Arniensis* I *Foro. Iuli. Mo destus* \[azz\], and makes in English,
according to Mr. Haverfield, 'Gaius Murrius Modestus, son of Gaius, of
the tribe Arniensis, of the town Forum Iulii.' The easiest way to
explain the last line as a whole is probably to treat it as a compound
with the qualifying word deriving its meaning, not from mare, 'the sea,'
but from the Late Latin *mara*, 'a marsh or bog.' Thus *Marini-Latium*
would mean 'Marshy Latium,' to distinguish it from Latium in Italy, and
from *Letha* or *Llydaw* in the sense of Brittany, which was analogously
termed in Medieval Irish *Armuirc* Letha  \[ba\], that is the Armorica
of *Letha*. This is borne out by the name of the church of Paulinus,
which is in Welsh *LlanY Gors*, anglicized *Llangorse*, ' the Church of
the Marsh or Bog,' and that is exactly the meaning of the name given it
in the *Taxatio* of Pope Nicholas, which is that of *Ecclesia de Mara*.
In other terms, we have in the qualified Latium of the inscription the
Latium or Letha which came to be called in Welsh Llydaw. It is, in my
opinion, from that settlement as their head quarters, that the Men of
LLydaw sallied forth to take part in the hunt in Ystrad Yw, where the
boar Llwydog was killed.

The idea that the story of Twrch Trwyth was more or less topographical
is not a new one. Lady Charlotte Guest, in her *Mabinogion*, ii. 363-5,
traces the hunt through several places called after Arthur, such as
*Buarth Arthur*, 'Arthur's Cattle-pen,' and *Bwrdd,Arthur*, 'Arthur's
Table,' besides others more miscellaneously named, such as *Twyn y
Moch*, 'the Swine's Hill ' near the source of the Amman, and *Llwyn y
Moch*, 'the Swine's Grove,' near the foot of the same eminence. But one
of the most remarkable statements in her note is the following:--'An
other singular coincidence may be traced between the name of a brook in
this neighbour. hood, called Echel, and the Echel Forclwyawlt who is
recorded in the tale as having been slain at this period of the chase.'
I have been unable to discover any clue to a brook called Echel, but one
called Egel occurs in the right place; so I take it that Lady Charlotte
Guest's informants tacitly identified the name with that of Echel.
Substantially they were probably correct, as the Egel, called Ecel in
the dialect of the district, flows into the upper Clydach, which in its
turn falls into the Tawe near Pont ar Dawe. As the next pool mentioned
is Llwch Tawe, I presume it was some water or other which drained into
the Tawe in this same neighbourhood. The relative positions of Llwch
Ewin, the Egel, and Llwch Tawe as indicated above offer no apparent
difficulty. The Goidelic name underlYing that of Echel was probably some
such a one as *Eccel* or *Ecell*; and *Ecell* occurs, for instance, in
the *Book of the Dun Cow*, fo. 80b, as the name of a noble or prince. In
rendering this name into Welsh as *Echel*, due regard was had for the
etymological equivalence of Goidelic *cc* or *c* to Welsh *ch*, but the
unbroken oral tradition of a people changing its language by degrees
from Goidelic to Welsh was subject to no such influence, especially in
the matter of local names; so the one here in question passed into Welsh
as Eccel, liable only to be modified into Egel. In any case, one may
assume that the death of the hero Echel was introduced to account for
the name of the brook Egel. Indications of something simLlar in the
linguistic sense occur in the part of the narrative relating the death
of Grugyn, at Garth Grugyn. This boar is pursued by two huntsmen called
Eli and Trachmyr, the name of the former of whom reminds one of Garth
Eli, in the parish of Llanclewi Brefi. Possibly the original story
located at Garth Eli the death of Eli, or some other incident in which
Grugyn was concerned; but the difficulty here is that the exact position
of Garth Grugyn is still uncertain.

Lastly, our information as to the hunting of Twrch Trwyth is not
exclusively derived from the Kulhwch, for besides an extremely obscure
poem about the Twrch in the *Book of Aneurin*, a manuscript of the
thirteenth century, we have one item given in the *Mirablilia*
associated with the *Historia Brittonum* of Nennius, § 73, and, this
carries us back to the eighth century. It reads as follows:--  
  
*Est aliud mirabile in regione qux dicitur Buelt. Est ibi cumulus
lapidum, et unus latis suterpositus super congestum, cum vestigo canis
in eo. Quando venatus est porcum Troit, impressit Cabal, qui erat canis
Arthuri militis, vestigium in lapide, et Arthur postea congregavit
congestum lapidum sub labide in quo erat vestigium canis sui, et vocatur
Carn Cabal, Et veniunt homines et tollunt lapidem in manibus suis per
spacium die et noctis, et in crastino die invenitur super congestum
suum*.

'Another wonder there is in the district called Buallt: there is there a
heap of stones, and one stone is placed on the top of the pile with the
footmark of a dog in it. Cafall, the dog of the warrior Arthur, when
chasing the pig Trwyd printed the mark of his foot on it, and Arthur
afterwards collected a heap of stones underneath the stone in which was
the footmark of his dog, and it is called Cafalt's Cairn. And men come
and take the stone away in their hands for the space of a day and a
night, and on the following day the stone is found on the top of its
heap \[bb\].'

Lady Charlotte Guest, in a note to the Kulhwch story in her
*Mabinogion*, ii. 360, appears to have been astonished to find that
*Carn Cavall*, as she writes it, was no fabulous mound but an actual I
mountain in the district of BuLlth, to the south of Rhayader Gwy, and
within sight of that town.' She went so far as to per. suade one of her
friends to visit the summit, and he begins his account of it to her with
the words: 'Cam Cavalt, or as it is generally pronounced Corn Cavalt, is
a lofty and rugged mountain.' On one of the caims on the mountain he
discovered what may have been the very stone to which the *Mirabilia*
story refers; but the sketch with which he accompanied his communication
cannot be said to be convincing, and he must have been drawing on his
imagination when he spoke of this somewhat high hill as a lofty
mountain. Moreover his account of its name only goes just far enough to
be misleading: the name as pronounced in the neighbourhood of Rhayader
is *Corn Gafalt* by Welsh-speaking people, and *Corn Gavalt* by monoglot
Englishmen. So it is probable that at one time the pronunciation was
Carn Gavall  \[bc\]. But to return to the incident recorded by Nennius,
one has to remark that it does not occur in the Kulhwch; nor, seeing the
position of the hLll, can it have been visited by Arthur or his dog in
the course of the Twrch Trwyth hunt as described by the redactor of the
story in its present form. This suggests the reflection not only that
the Twrch story is very old, but that it was put together by selecting
certain incidents out of an indefinite number, which, taken all
together, would probably have formed a network covering the whole of
South Wales as far north as the boundary of the portion of Mid-Wales
occupied by the Brythons before the Roman occupation. In other words,
the Goidels of this country had stories current among them to explain
the names of the places with which they were famLliar; and ifis known
that was the case with the Goidels of Ireland. Witness the place-name
legends known in Medieval Irish as Dindsenchas, with which the old
literature of Ireland abounds. On what principle the narrator of the
Kulhwch made his selection from the repertoire I cannot say; but one
cannot help seeing that he takes little interest in the detaLls, and
that he shows stLll less insight into the etymological motz)r of the
incidents which he mentions. However, this should be laid mainly to the
charge, perhaps, of the early medieval redactor.  
  
Among the reasons which have been suggested for the latter overlooking
and effacing the play on the placenames, I have hinted that be did not
always understand them, as they sometimes involved a language which may
not have been his. This raises the question of translation: if the story
was originally in Goidelic, what was the process by which it passed into
Brythonic? Two answers suggest themselves, and the first comes to this:
if the story was in writing, we may suppose a literary man to have sat
down to translate it word for word from Goidelic to Brythonic, or else
to adapt it in a looser fashion. In either case, one should suppose him
a master of both languages, and capable of doing justice to the play on
the place-names. But it is readLly conceivable that the fact of his
understanding both languages might lead him to miscalculate what was .
exactly necesary to enable a monoglot Brython to grasp his meaning
clearly. Moreover, if the translator had ideas of his own as to style,
he might object on principle to anything like an explanation of words
being interpolated in the narrative. In short, one could see several
loopholes through which a little confusion might force itself in, and
prevent the monoglot reader or hearer of the translation from correctly
grasping the story at all points as it was in the original. The other
view, and the more natural one, as I think, is that we should postulate
the interference of no special translator, but suppose the story, or
rather a congeries of stories, to have been current among the natives of
a certain part of South Wales, say the LoughorValley, at a time when
their language was still Goidelic, and that, as they gradually gave up
Goidelic and adopted Brythonic, they retained their stories and
translated the narrative, whLle they did not always translate the
place-names occurring in that narrative. Thus, for instance, would arise
the discrepancy between *banw* and *Amanw*, the latter of which to be
Welsh should have been rendered y Banw, 'the Boar! If this is
approximately what took place, it is easy to conceive the possibLlity of
many points of nicety being completely effaced in the course of such a
rough process of ti-ansformation. In one or two small matters it happens
that we can contrast the community as translator with the literary
individual at work: I allude to the word *Trwyth*. That vocable was not
translated, not metaphoned, if I may so term it, at all at the time: it
passed, when it was still *Treth-i,* from Goidelic into Brythonic, and
continued in use without a break; for the changes whereby *Treth-i* has
become *Trwyth* have been such as other words have undergone in the
course of ages, as already stated. On the other hand, the literary man
who knew something of the two languages seems to have reasoned, that
where a Goidelic th occurred between vowels, the correct etymological
equivalent in Brythonic was *t*, subject to be mutated to *d*. So when
he took the name over he metaphoned *Treth-i* into *Tret-i*, whence we
have the *Porcus Troit* of Nennius, and *Twrch Trwyd* \[bc\] in Welsh
poetry: these *Troit* and *Trwyd* were the literary forms as contrasted
with the popular *Trwyth*. Now, if my surmises as to Echel and Egel are
near the truth, their history must be similar; that is to say, *Echel*
would be the literary form and *Ecel*, *Egel* the popular one
respectively of the Goidelic Ecell. A third parallel offers itself in
the case of the personal name *Arwyli*, borne by one of Echel's
companions: the *Arwyl* of that name has its etymological equivalent in
the *Arwystl*- of *Arwystli*, the name of a district comprising the
eastern slopes of Plinlimmon, and represented now by the Deanery of
Arwystli. So *Arwystli* challenges comparison with the Irish *Airgialla*
or Airgéill, anglicized *Oriel*, which denotes, roughly speaking, the
modern counties of Armagh, Louth, and Monaghan. For here we have the
same prefix *ar* placed in front of one and the same vocable, which in
Welsh is *wystl*, 'a hostage,' and in Irish *giall*, of the same meaning
and origin. The reader will at once think of the same word in German as
*geisel*, 'a hostage,' Old High German *gisal*. But the divergence of
sound between *Arwystl*-i and *Arwyl*-i arises out of the difference of
treatment of *sl* in Welsh and Irish. In the Brythonic district of
Mid-Wales we have *Arwystli* with *s*l treated in the Brythonic way,
whLle in Arwyli we have the combination treated in the Goidelic way, the
result being left standing when the speakers of Goidelic in South Wales
learnt Brythonic \[bd\].

.Careful observation may be expected to add to the number of these
instructive instances. It is, however, not to be supposed that all
double forms of the names in these stories areto be explained in exactly
the same way. Thus, for instance, corresponding to Lug, genitive Loga,
we have the two forms Lleu and Lew, of which the former alone matches
the Irish. But it is to be observed that Lleu remains in some verses
\[be\] in the story of Math, whereas in the prose he appears to be
called Llew. It is not improbable that the editing which introduced Llew
dates comparatively late, and that it was done by a man who was not
familiar with the Venedotian place-names of which lLeu formed part,
namely, *Dinlleu* and *Nantllem*, now *Dinlle* and *Nantlle*. Simmilarly
the two brothers, Gofannon and Amaethon, as they are called in the
*Mabinogi* of Math and in the Kulhwch story, are found also called
Gofynyon and Amathaon. The former agrees with the Irish form Goibniu,
genitive Goibnenn, whereas Gofannon does not. As to Amaethon or
Arnathaon the Irish counterpart has, unfortunately, not been identified.
Gofannon and Amaethon have the appearance of being etymologically
transparent in Welsh, and they have probably been remodelled by the hand
of a literary redactor.  
There were also two forms of the name of Manawydan in Welsh; for by the
side of that there was another, namely, Manawydan, liable to be
shortened to Manawyd: both occur in old Welsh poetry \[bf\]. But
*manawyd* or *mynawyd* is the Welsh word for an awl, which is
significant here, as the *Mabinogi* called after Manawyddan makes him
become a shoemaker on two occasions, whence the Triads style him one of
the Three golden Shoemakers of the Isle of Prydain: see the Oxford
*Mabinogion*, p. 308.

What has happened in the way of linguistic change in one of our stories,
the Kulhwch, may have happened in others, say in the four branches of
the *Mabinogi*, namely, Pwyll, prince of Dyved; Branwen, daughter of
Llyr; Math, son of Mathonwy; and Manawyctan, son of Llyr. Some time ago
'endeavoured to show that the principal characters in the *Mabinogi* of
Math, namely, the sons and daughters of Don, are to be identified as a
group with the Tuatha Dé Danann, 'Tribes of the Goddess Danu or Donu,'of
Irish legend. I called attention to the identity of our Welsh Don with
the Irish Donu, genitive Donann, Gofynion or Gofannon with Goibniu,
genitive Goibnenn, and of Lleu or Llew with Lug. Since then Professor
Zimmer has gone further, and suggested that the *Mabinogion* are of
Irish origin; but that I cannot quite admit. They are of Goidelic
origin, but they do not come from the Irish or the Goidels of Ireland:
they come rather, as I think, from this country's Goidels, who never
migrated to the sister island, but remained here eventually to adopt
Brythonic speech. There is no objection, however, so far as this
argument is concerned, to their being regarded as this country's Goidels
descended either from nat've Goidels or from early Goidelic invaders
from Ireland, or else partly from the one origin and partly from the
other. This last is perhaps the safest view to accept as a working
hypothesis. Now Professor Zimmer fixes on that of *Mathonwy*, among
other names, as probably the Welsh adaptation of some such an Irish name
as the genitive Mathgamnai \[bg\], now anglicized Mahony. This I am also
prepared to accept in the sense that the Welsh form is a loan from a
Goidelic one current some time or other in this country, and represented
in Irish by *Mathgamnai*. The preservation of Goidelic th in *Mathonwy*
stamps it as ranking with *Trwyth, Egel, and Arwyli*, as contrasted with
a form etymologically more correct, of which we seem to have an echo in
the Breton names Madganoe and Madgone \[bh\].

Another name which I am inclined to regard as brought in from Goidelic
is that of Gilvaethwy, son of Don: it would seem to involve some such a
word as the Irish *gilla*, 'a youth, an attendant or servant,' and some
form of the Goidelic name *Maughteus* or *Mochla*, so that the name
*Gilla-mochtai* meant the attendant of Mochta. This last vocable appears
in Irish as the name of several saints, but previously it was probably
that of some pagan god of the Goidels, and its meaning was most likely
the same as that of the Irish participial *mochta*, which Stokes
explains as 'magnified, glorified see his *Calendar of Oengus*, p.
ccxiv, and compare the name *Mael-mochta*. Adamnan, in his *Vita S.
Columbae*, writes the name *Maucteus* in the following passage, pref.
ii. p. 6:--\[22\]

Nam quidam proselytus Brito, homo sanctus, sancti Patricii episcopi
discpulus, Macteus nominae, ita de nostro prothetizavit Patrono, sicutii
nobis ab antiquis traditum expertis compertum habetur.  
  
This saint, who is said to have prophesied of St. Columba and died in
the year 534, is described in his Life (Aug. ig) as *ortus ex Britannia*
\[bi\]*'*, which, coupled with Adamnan's Brito, probably refers him to
Wales; but it is remarkable that nevertheless he bore the very
un-Brythonic name of *Mochta* or *Mauchta* \[bj\].

To return to the *Mabinogion:* I have long been inclined to identify
Llwyd, son of Kilcoed, with the Irish Liath \[ak\], son of Celtchar, of
Cualu in the present county of Wicklow. Liath, whose name means 'grey,'
is described as the comeliest youth of noble rank among the fairies of
Erin; and the only time the Welsh Llwyd, whose name also means 'grey,'
appears in the Mabinogion he is ascribed, not the comeliest figure, it
is true, or the greatest personal beauty, but the most imposing disguise
of a bishop attended by his suite: he was a great magician. The name of
his father, Kil-coet, seems to me merely an inexact popular rendering of
Ceftchar, the name of Liath's father: at any rate one faLls here to
detect the touch of the skilled translator or literary redactor But the
*Mabinogi* of Manawyddan, in which Llwyd figures, is also the one in
which Pryderi king of Dyfed's wife is called *Kicua* or *Cigfa*, a name
which has no claim to be regarded as Brythonic. It occurs early,
however, in the legendary history of Ireland: the *Four Masters*, under
the year A.M. 2520, mention a Ciocbha as wife of a son of Parthalon; and
so it seems probable that the Welsh Llyr \[bm\] is no other word than
the Goidelic genitive *Lir*, retained in use with its pronunciation
modified according to the habits of the Welsh language; and in that case
\[bn\] it forms comprehensive evidence, that the stories about  the Llyr
famLly in Welsh legend were Goidelic before they put on a Brythonic
garb. \[23\]

As to the *Mabinogion* generally, one may say that they are devoted to
the fortunes chiefly of three powerful houses or groups, the children of
Don, the children of Llyr, and Pwyll's family. This last is brought into
contact with the Llyr group, which takes practically the position of
superiority. Pwyll's family belonged chiefly to Dyfed; but the power and
influence of the sons of Llyr had a far wider range: we find them in
Anglesey, at Harlech, in Gwales or the Isle of Grasholm off
Pembrokeshire, at Aber Henvelen somewhere south of the Severn Sea, and
in Ireland. But the expedition to Ireland under Bran, usually called
*Bendigeituran*, 'Bran \[bo\]  the Blessed,' proved so disastrous that
the Llyr group, as a whole, disappears, making way for the children of
Don. These last came into collision with Pwylls son, Pryderi, in whose
country Manawyddan, son of Llyr, had ended his days. Pryderi, in
consequence of Gwydion's deceit, makes war on Math and the children of
Don: he falls in it, and his army gives hostages to Math. Thus after the
disappearance of the sons of Llyr, the children of Don are found in
power in their stead in North Wales \[bp\], and that state of things
corresponds closely enough to the relation between the Tuatha Dé Danann
and the Lir family in Irish legend. There Lir and his famLly are
reckoned in the number

The whole cycle of the *Mabinogion* must have appeared strange to the
story-teller and the poet of medieval Wales, and far removed from the
world in which they lived. We have possibly a trace of this feeling in
the epithet *hen*, 'old, ancient,' given to Math in a poem in the *Red
Book of Hergest*, where we meet with the line \[br\]:--

Gan uath hen gax gouannon.  
With Math the ancient, with Gofannon.  
  
Similarly in the confused list of heroes which the story-teller of the
Kulhwch (*Mabinogion*, p. 108) was able to put together, we seem to have
Gofannon, Math's relative, referred to under the designation of
*Gouynyon Hen*, 'Gofynion the Ancient.' To these might be added others,
such as Gwrbothu Hen, mentioned above, and from another source Lleu Hen
\[bs\], ' LLew the Ancient.' So strange, probably, and so obscure did
some of the contents of the stories themselves seem to the
story-tellers, that they may be now and then suspected of having effaced
some of the features which it would have interested us to find
preserved. This state of things brings back to my mind words of Matthew
Arnold's, to which I had the pleasure of listening more years ago than I
care to remember. He was lecturing at Oxford on Celtic literature, and
observing 'how evidently the mediawal story-teller is pLllaging an
antiquity of which he does not fully possess the secret; he is like a
peasant,' Matthew Arnold went on to say,'building his hut on the site of
Halicarnassus or Ephesus; he builds, but what he builds is full of
materials of which he knows not the history, or knows by a glimmering
tradition merely-stones "not of this buLlding," but of an older
architecture, greater, cunninger, more majestical. In the mediwval
stories of no Latin or Teutonic people does this strike one as in those
of the Welsh.' This becomes intelligible only on the theory of the
stories having been in Goidelic before they put on a Welsh dress.

When saying that the *Mabinogion* and some of the stories contained in
the Kulhwch, such as the Hunting of Twrch Trwyth, were Goidelic before
they became Brythonic, I wish to be understood to use the word Goidelic
in a qualified sense. For tLll the Brythons came, the Goidels were, I
take it, the ruling race in most of the southern half of Britain, with
the natives as their subjects, except in so far as that statement has to
be limited by the fact, that we do not know how far they and the natives
had been amalgamating together. In any case, the hostLle advent of
anolher race, the Brythons, would probably tend to hasten the process of
amalgamation. That being so, the stories which I have loosely called
Goidelic may have been largely aboriginal in point of origin, and by
that I mean native, pre-Celtic and non-Aryan. It comes to this, then: we
cannot say for certain whose creation Bran, for instance, should be
considered to have been-that of Goidels or of non-Aryan natives. He sat,
as the *Mabinogi* of Branwen des-cribes him, on the rock of Harlech, a
figure too colossal for any house to contain or any ship to carry. This
would seem to challenge comparison with Cernunnos, the squatting god of
ancient Gaul, around whorn the other gods appear as mere striplings, as
proved by the monumental representations in point. In these \[bt\] he
sometimes appears antlered like a stag; sometimes he is provided either
with three normal heads or with one head furnished with three faces; and
sometimes he is reduced to a head provided with no body, which reminds
one of Bran, who, when he had been rid of his body in consequence of a
poisoned wound inflicted on him in his foot in the slaughter of the
Meal-bag PavLlion, was reduced to the *Urddawl Ben*, 'Venerable or
Digmified Head,' mentioned in the *Mabinogi* of Branwen \[bu\]. The
*Mabinogi* goes on to relate how Bran's companions began to enjoy,
subject to certain conditions, his ' Venerable Head's' society, which
involved banquets of a fabulous duration and of a nature not readily to
be surpassed by those around the Holy Grail. In fact here we have beyond
all doubt one of the heathen originals of which the Grail is a Christian
version. But the multiplicity of faces or heads of the Gaulish divinity
find their analogues in a direction hitherto unnoticed as far as I know,
namely, among the LettoSlavic peoples of the Baltic sea-board. Thus the
image of Svatovit in the island of Ragen is said to have had four faces
\[bv\]; and the life of Otto of Bamberg relates \[bw\] how that
high-handed evangelist proceeded to convert the ancient Prussians to
Christianity. Among other things we are told how he found at Stettin an
idol called Triglaus, a word referring to the three heads for which the
god was remarkable. The saint took possession of the image and hewed
away the body, reserving for himself the three heads, which are
represented adhering together, forming one piece. This he sent as a
trophy to Rome, and in Rome it may be still. Were it perchance to be
found, it might be expected to show a close resemblance to the tricepbal
of the Gaulish altar found at Beaune in Burgundy.  
  
Before closing this chapter a word may be permitted as to the Goidelic
element in the history of Wales: it wLll come again before the reader in
a later chapter, but what has already been advanced or implied
concerning it may here be recapitulated as follows:--  
  
It has been suggested that the hereditary dislike of the Brython for the
Goidel argues their having formerly lived in close proximity to one
another: see  above.  
  
The tradition that the cave treasures of the Snowdon district belong by
right to the Goidels, means that they were formerly supposed to have
hidden them away when hard pressed by the Brythons: see above.  
  
The sundry instances of a pair of names for a single person or place,
one Goidelic (Brythonicized) still in use, and the other Brythonic
(suggested by the Goidelic one), literary mostly and obsolete, go to
prove that the Goidels were not expelled, but allowed to remain to adopt
Brythonic speech.

Evidence of the indebtedness of story-tellers in Wales to their brethren
of the same profession in Ireland is comparatively scarce; and almost in
every instance of recent research establishing a connexion between
topics or incidents in the Arthurian romances and the native literature
of Ireland, the direct contact may be assumed to have been with the
folklore and legend of the Goidelic inhabitants of Wales, whether before
or after their change of language.

Probably the folklore and mythology of the Goidels of Wales and of
Ireland were in the mass much the same, though in some instances they
reach us in different stages of development: thus in such a case as that
of Don and Danu (genitive *Danann*) the Welsh allusions in point refer
to Don at a conspicuously earlier stage of her role than that
represented by the Irish literature touching the Tuatha Dé Danann \[bx\]

 The common point of view from which our ancestors liked to look at the
scenery around them is well Lllustrated by the fondness of the Goidel,
in Wales and Ireland alike, for incidents to explain his place-names. He
required the topography-indeed he requires it stLll, and hence the
activity of the local etymologist-to connote story or history: he must
have something that wLll impart the cold light of physical nature, river
and lake, moor and mountain, a warmer tint, a dash of the pathetic
element, a touch of the human, borrowed from the light and shade of the
world of imagination and fancy in which he lives and dreams.

\[a\] They are produced here in their order as printed at the beginning
of the second volume of the *Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales*, and the
series or versions are indicated as i, ii, iii. Version ii will be found
printed in the third volume of the *Cymmrodor*, pp. 52-61 also in the
Oxford *Mabinogion*, pp. 297-308, from the *Red Book of Hergest* of the
fourteenth century. The letter (a, b, c) added is intended to indicate
the order of the three parts of the Triad, for it is not the same in all
the series. Let me here remark in a general way that the former fondness
of the Welsh for Triads was not peculiar to them. The Irish also must
have been at one time addicted to this grouping. Witness the Triad of
Cleverest Countings, in the *Book of the Dun Cow*, fol. 58A, and the
Triad of the Blemishes of the Women of Ulster, ib. 43b.

\[b\] As to the names Drystan (also Trystan) and Essytit, see above.

\[c\] This was meant to explain the unusual term *g6rdueichyat*, also
written *g6rdwichat*, *g6rutichyat*, and *gwrddfeiehiad*. This last
comes in the modern spelling of iii. 101, where this clause is not put
in the middle of the Triad but at the end.

  
\[d\] The editor of this version seems to have supposed Pendaran to have

\[e\] This word is found written in Mod. Welsh *Annwfm*, but it has
been  
mostly superseded by the curtailed form *Annwn*, which appears twice in
the

Meyer  
and Stern's *Zeitschrift fur Celtische Philoologie*i, 29-34 where he
equates  
*Annwfn* with the Breton *anauon*, which is a plural used collectively
for the souls of the departed, the other world. His view, however, of
these interesting words has since been mentioned in the same
*Zeitschrift*, iii. 184-5, and opposed in the Annals de Bretagne. xi.

\[i\] See the Oxford *Mabinogion*, p. 196, and Guest's trans., i. 302,
where the Welsh words a gol6ython o gic meluoch are rendered 'and
collops of the flesh of the wild boar,' which can hardly be correct; for
the *mel* in *mel-uoch*, or *mel-foch* in the modern spelling, is the
equivalent of the Irish *melg*, 'milk.' So the word must refer either to
a pig that had been fed on cows' milk or else a sucking pig. The former
is the more probable meaning, but one is not helped to decide by the
fact, that the word is still sometimes used in books by writers who
imagine that they have here the word mel, I honey,' and that the
compound means pigs whose flesh is as sweet as honey: see Dr. Pughe's
*Dictionary*, where *melfoch* is rendered 'honey swine/ whatever that
may mean  it was but natural to suppose that they had the animals which
man found useful, such as horses, cattle, and sheep, except that they
were held to be of superior breeds, as they are represented, for
instance, in our lake legends. Similarly, it is natural enough that
other stories should ascribe to them also the possession of herds of
swine; and all this prior to man's having any. The next step in the
reasoning would be that man had obtained his from the fairies. It is
some tradition of this kind that possibly suggested the line taken by
the Pwyll

\[k\] *Cotllirui* was probably, like *Gwenfrewi*, a woman's name: this
is a point of some importance when taken in connexion with what was said

\[l\] This reminds one of Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Henvinus*, whom he
makes into *dux Cornubiae* and father of *Cunedagius* or *Cunedda*: see

Cunedda and Dyfnwal Moelmud (ii. 17) with Cornwall is due to the fact,
that the name of the Dumnonia of the North had been forgotten long
before that of the Dumnonia to be identified with Devon and Cornwall.

parish.

\[p\] *Mergaed* for *Mengwaed* hardly requires any explanation; and as
to *Breat* or rather *Vreat*, as it occurs in mutation, we have only to
suppose the original carelessly written *Vreac* for *Vreach*, and we
have the usual error of neglecting the stroke indicating the n, and the
very common one of confounding *c* with *t*. This first-mentioned name
should possibly be analysed into *Mengw-aed* or *Menw-aed* for an Irish
*Menb-aed*, with the *menb*, 'little,'noticed; in that case one might
compare such compounds of *Aed* as *Beo-aed* and *Lug-aed* in the
*Martyrology of Gorman*. Should this prove well founded the Mod. Welsh
transcription of *Menwaed* should be *Menwaedd*. I have had the use of
other versions of the Triads from MSS. in the Peniarth collection; but
they contribute nothing of any great importance as regards the proper
names in the passages here in question.

\[t\] Menw's name is to be equated with the Irish word ownh, 'little,
small,' and connected with the Welsh derivative *di-fenw-i*, 'belittling
or reviling': it will be seen that he takes the form of a bird, and his
designation *Menw  fab Teirgwaedd* might perhaps be rendered  'Little,
son of Three-Cries.'  
  
\[u\] Identified by Professor Kuno Meyer in the *Transactions of the
Cymmrodorion  Society* 1895-6, p. 73, with a place in Leinster called
*Sescenn Uairbeoil*,  'the Marsh of Uairbhél,' where Uairbhél may
possibly be a man's name, but more likely that of a pass or gap
described as Cold-mouth: compare the Slack or Sloc in the Isle of Man,
called in Manx I the big Mouth of the Wind! The Irish name comes near in
part to the Welsh Esgeir Oervel or Oerfel, which means 'the mountain
Spur of cold weather.'

\[v\] The word used in the text is *ystyr*, which now means 'meaning or
signification'; but it is there used in the sense of I history,' or of
the Latin historia,' from which it is probably borrowed.

\[w\] In the original his designation is *Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd*,
and the man so called is in the Kulhwch credited with the mastery of all
languages, including those of certain birds and quadrupeds. *Gwalstawt*,
found written also *gwalstot*, is the Anglo-Saxon word *wealhstod*, 'an
interpreter,' borrowed. The name Gwrhyr is possibly identical with that
of Ferghoir, borne by the Stentor of Fionn mac Cumhaill's following.
Ferghoir's every shout is said to have been audible over three cantreds.
Naturally one who was to parley with a savage host had good reason to
cultivate a far-reaching voice, if he wished to be certain of returning
to his friends. For more about it see the footnote at p.  489 of my
*Hibbert Lectures*.

\[x\] The original has Pelumyawc, p. 138, and the name occurs in the
(Red Book) *Bruts*, p. 355, as Pelunyawc, and p. 411 as Pelunea(wc)
between the commots of Amgoed and Velfrey. The identification here
suggested comes from Mr. Phillimore, who has seen that Peuliniawc must
be a derivative from the name Paulinus, that is of the Paulinus,
probably, who is mentioned in an ancient inscription at Llandysilio.
There are other churches called after Tysilio, so this one used to be
distinguished as *Llandysilio yn Yyfed*, that is, Llandysilio-in -Dyfed;
but the pronunciation was much the same as if it had been written
Llandysilio yn Yfed, meaning 'Llandysilio-a-drinking,' 'whereof arose a
merrye jest,' as George Owen tells us in his Pembrokeshire, p. 9. It is
now sometimes called *Llandysilio'r Gynffon*, or ' Llandysilio of the
Tail,' from the situation of a part of the parish on a strip as it were
a tail, of Carmarthenshire land running into Pembrokeshire.  
  
 \[y\] This Aber Towy appears to have been a town with a harbour in
1042, for we read in *Brut y Tywysogion* of a cruel engagement fought
there between Gruffydd ab Llewelyn and Howel ab Edwin, who, with Irish
auxiliaries, tried to effect a landing. Not long ago a storm, carrying
away the accumulation of sand, laid bare a good deal of the site. It is
to be hoped that excavations will be made soon on the spot.  
  
\[z\] See the Transactions of the *Cymmrodorion*, 1894-5,pp. 146-7.
There are a good many *clyns* about South Wales, but our etymologists
are careful to have them in most cases written *glyn*, 'a glen.' Our
story, however, shows that the word came under the influence of glyn
long ago, for it should be, when accented, *clun*, corresponding to
Irish *cluain*, 'a meadow.' We have it as *clun* in *Clun Kein* in the
*Black Book*, p. 34 b, where I guess it to mean the place now called
Cdcain, I Kilken' in Flintshire, which is accented on the first
syllable; and we have had it in y Clun Hir, 'the Long Meadow,' mentioned
above.  
  
\[aa\] Cas Llychwr, 'Loughor Castle,' is supposed to involve in its
*Llychwr*, *Llwchwr, or Loughor*, the name of the place in the
*Antoninus Itinerary*, 484, 1, to wit *Leucarum*; but the guttural
spirant *ch* between vowels in Llwhwr argues a phonetic process which
was Goidelic rather than Brythonic.

\[ab\] Lluydac Gouynnyat would seem to mean Llwydawc the Asker or
Demander, and the epithet occurs also in the Kulbwch in the name
*Gallcoyt Gouynynat (Mabinogion*, 106), to be read doubtless *G.
Gouynnyat*,  'G. who asks or demands': possibly one should rather
compare with *Go-uynnyat* the word *tra-mynyat*, 'a wild boar': see
Williams' *Seint Greal*, pp. 374, 381. However, the epithets in the
Twrch Trwyth story do not count so far as concerns the place-names
derived.

\[ac\] Other instances of the like shortening occur in words like
*cefnder*,  
'a cousin,' for *cefnderw*, and *arddel*, 'to own,' for *arddelw*. As to
Amman, it enters, also, into a group of Glamorganshire place-names:
witness Aber Amman and CWm Amman, near Aberdare.

\[ad\] It should perhaps be looked for near Brechfa, where there is a
Hafod Grugyn, and, as I am told, a *Garth* also which is, however, not
further defined. For it appears that both Brechfa and Cayo, though now
in Carmarthenshire, once belonged to Keredigion: see OvNm's
*Pembrokeshire*, p. 216. But perhaps another spot should be considered:
J. D. Rhys, the grammarian (above), gives in the Peniarth MS. 118 a list
of *caers* or castles called after giants, and among them is that of
Grugyn in the parish, he says, of 'Llan Hilar.' I have, however, not
been able to hear of any trace of the name there, though I should guess
the spot to have been Pen y Castell, called in English Castle Hill, the
residence of Mr. Loxdale in the parish of lLlaniIar, near Aberystwyth.  
  
\[ae\] I have re-examined the passage, and I have no doubt that the
editors were wrong in printing *Gregyn*: the manuscript has *Grugyn*,
which comes in the last line of column 841. Now besides that the line is
in part somewhat faint, the scribe has evidently omitted something from
the original story, and I guess that the lacuna occurs in the first line
of the next column after the words y has, I was killed,' which seem to
end the story of Grugyn.

\[af\] Those who have discovered an independent Welsh appeflative *wy*
meaning water are not to be reasoned with. The Welsh *wy* only means an
egg, while the meaning of *Gwy* as the name of the Wye has still to be
discovered.  
  
\[ag\] This name also occurs in a passage quoted in Jones' Brecknock, ii
501, from a Carte MS. which he treats as relating to the year 1234 . the
MS. is said to be at the Bodleian, though I have not succeeded in
tracing it. But Jones gives *Villa de Ystraddewi*, and speaks of a
chapel of St. John's of *Stradlewi*, which must have been St. John's
Church, at Tretower, one of the ecclesiastical districts of Cwm Du: see
also P- 497. The name is probably to be treated as *Strad* or *Strat
d'Ewe*.

\[ah\] A river may in Welsh be briefly called after anybody or anything.
Thus in North Cardiganshire there is a stream called *Einon*, that is to
say 'Einion's river,' and the flat land on both sides of it is called
*Ystrad Einon*, which looks as if one might translate it Einion's
Strath, but it means the Strath of Einion's river, or of the stream
called Einon, as one will at once see from the upper course of the water
being called *Blaen Einon*, which can only mean the upper course of the
Einon river. So here yw is in English 'yew,' but *Ystrad Yw* and *Llygad
Yw* have to be rendered the Strath of the Yew burn and the Eye of the
Yew burn respectively. It is moreover felt by the Welsh-speaking people
of the district that *yw* is the plural of *ywen*,, a single yew,' and
as there is only one yew at the source somebody had the brilliant idea
of making the name right by calling it *Ywen*, and this has got into the
maps as Ewyn, as though it were the Welsh word for foam. Who began it I
cannot say, but Theophilus Jones his it in his *History of the County of
Brecknock,* published in 1809. Nevertheless the name is still *Yw*, not
*Ywen* or *Ewyn*, in the Welsh of the district, though Lewis gives it as
*Ywen* in his article on

Llanvihangel-Cwm-Du.

\[ai\] For exact information as to the Gaer, the Yw, and Llygad Yw, I am
indebted chiefly to the courtesy of Lord Glanusk, the owner of that
historic strath, and to the Rector of ILansantffread, who made a special
visit to *Llygad Yw* for me; also to Mr. Francis Evans, of the Farmers'
Arms at the Bwlch, who would be glad to change the name *Llygad Yw* into
*Llygad dan yr Ywen*, 'the Source beneath the Yew-tree,' partly on
account of the position 'of the spring emanating under the but of the
yew tree,' and partly because there is only a single yew there.
Theophilus Jones complained a century ago that the Gaer in Ystrad Yw had
not attracted the attention it deserved; and I have been greatly
disappointed to find that the Cambrian Archaeological Association has
had nothing to say of it. At any rate, I have tried the Index of its
proceedings and found only a single mention of it. The whole district is
said to teem with antiquities, Celtic, Roman, and Norman.  
  
\[aj\] Theophilus Jones, in his *Brecknockshire* ii. 5oa, describes
Miarth or Myarth as a I very extensive' camp, and proceeds as
follows:--' Another British camp of less extent is seen on a knoll on
Pentir hill, westward of the Rhiangott and the parish church of Cwmdu,
above a wood called Coed y Gaer, and nearly opposite to the peak or
summit called Cloch y Pibwr, or the piper's call.' This would probably
be more accurately rendered the Piper's Rock or Stone, with *cloch*
treated as the Goidelic word for a stone rather than the Brythonic word
for a bell: how many more *clochs* in our place-names are Goidelic?

\[ak\] The Twrch would seem to have crossed somewhere opposite the mouth
of the Wye, let us say not very far from Aust; but he escapes to
Cornwall without anything happening to him, so we are left without any
indication whether the story originally regarded Kernyw as including the
Penrhyn Awstin of the Coll story.

\[al\] For this suggestion I am indebted to the Rev. Dr. Gaster in the
Cymmrodorion's *Transactions* for 1894--5, p. 341 and also for
references in point to M. Cosquin's *Contes Populaires de la Lorraine*,
i. 134, 141, 152. Compare also such Gaelic stories as that of the Bodach
Glas, translated by Mrs. Mackellar, in the *Celtic Magazine*,  xii.
12-6, 57-64.

\[am\]  In some native Welsh words we have an option between a prefix
*ym* and am, an option arising out of the fact that originally it was
neither *ym* nor *am*, but *m*, for an earlier *mbi*, of the same origin
as Latin *ambi* and Greek άμρι, 'around, about'. The article, its
meaning in the combination in baxbh being forgotten, would fall under
the influence of the analogy of the prefix, now am orym, so far as the
pronunciation was concerned.

\[an\] Possibly the *benwic* was thrown in to correct the reckoning when
the redactor discovered, as he thought, that he had one too many to
account for: it has been pointed out that he had forgotten that one had
been killed in Ireland.  
  
\[ao\] It is just possible, however, that in an older version it was
named, and that the place was no other than the rock just above Ystrad
Yw, called Craig Ltvyd or, as it is said to be pronounced, *Craig
Llwyd*. If so, *Llwyd* would seem to have been substituted for the
dissyllable *Llwydog*: compare the same person called *Llwyt* and
*Lwydeu* in the *Mabixogion*, pp. 57; 110; 136.

\[ap\] The name is well known in that of Llanrhaiadr yn Mochnant,
'Llanrhaiadr in Mochnant,' in the north of Montgomeryshire.  
  
\[aq\]  Between Colwyn Bay and Landudno junction, on the Chester and
Holyhead line of railway.

\[ar\] I have discussed:some of the traces of the Goidels in Wales in
the *Arch. Camb*. for 1895, pp. 18-39, 264-302; 1899, pp.  160-7.  
  
\[as\] In fact the genitive Grfucind occurs in the *Book of Leinster*,
fo.. 359b.

\[at\] The sort of question one would like to ask in that district is,
whether there is a spot there called *Bedd y Rhyswyr, Carn y Rhyswyr*,
or the like. The word *rhyswr* is found applied to Arthur himself in the
Life of Gruffyd ab Cynan, as the equivalent probably of the Latin
*Arthur Miles* (p. 538 below): see the *Myvyrian Archaiology*, ii. 590.
Similarly the soldiers or champions of Christ are called rys6yr cri\~t
in the Welsh Life of St. David: see the *Elucidaium* and other Tracts
(in the *Anecdota Oxoniensis*), p. 118.

\[au\] Rudvyw Rys would be in Modern Welsh *Rhuddfyw Rys*, and probably
means Rhudfyw the Champion or Fighter, as Rhys is likely to have been
synonymous with *rhyswr*. The corresponding Irish name was *Russ* or
*Ross*, genitive *Rossa*, and it appears to come from the same origin as
Irish row, 'a headland, a forest,' Welsh *rhos*, 'moorland, uncultivated
ground.' Ile original meaning-was presumably I exposed or open and
untilled land'; and Stokes supposes the word to stand for an early
*(p)ro-sto*- with sto of the same origin as Latin *sto*, 'I stand,' and
as the English word stand itself. In that case *Ros*, genitive *Rossa*,
Welsh *Rhys*, would mean one who stands out to fight, a xxxxxxxx, so to
say. But not only are these words of a different declension implying a
nominative *Ro-stus*, but the Welsh one must have been once accented
*Ro-sitis* on the ending which is now lost, otherwise there is no
accounting for the change of the remaining vowel into *y*. Other
instances postulating an early Welsh accentuation of the same kind are
very probably *llyg*, 'a fieldmouset' Irish luck, 'a mouse'; *pryd*,
'form,' Irish *cruth*; *pryf*, 'aworm,' Irish *cruim*; so also with
*ych*, 'an ox; and *nyth*, 'a nest,' Irish *nett*, genitive *nitt*,
derived by Stokes from *niedo*-, which, however, must have been oxytone,
like the corresponding Sanskrit *nidhd*. There is one very interesting
compound of *rhys*, namely the saint's name *Rhwydrys*, as it were
*Redo-rostms* to be compared with Gaulish xxxxxxx, which is found in
Irish analysed into *ri Eochraidhi*, designating the fairy king who was
father to Etain: see Windisch's *Irische Texte* p. 119. *Bledrws,
Bledrus*, as contmsted with *Bledrws, Bledris*, postulate Goidelic
accentuation, while one has to treat *Bledruis* as a compromise between
*Bledrws and Bledris*, unless it be due to misreading a *Bledruif*
(*Book of Llan Dav*, pp. 185, 221-29 and *Arch. Camb*. for 1875, p.
310).The Goidelic accent at an early date moved to first syllables,
hence cruth (with its vowel influenced by the *u* of a stem *qurt* under
the stress accent, became, when unstressed, *cridh* (from a simplified
stem *crt*) as in *Nokride* (also *Noicrothach*, Windisch, ibid., pp.
259, 261,:a66) and *Luicridh* (*Four Masters*, A. D. 748), *Luccaid*,
genitive *Luccruide* (*Book of Leinster*, 359f) *Luguqurit* in Ogam

\[av\] These operations cannot have been the first of the kind in the
district, as a writer in the *Archæologia Cambrensis* for 1862, pp.
159-60, in extracting a note from the *Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries* (series II, vol. i. p. 10) relative to the discovery of the
canoe, adds a statement based on the same volume, p. 161, to the effect
that 'within half a mile of Llyn Llydaw there are the remains of a
British town, not marked in the ordnance map, corn. prising the
foundations of numerous circular dwellings. In some of them quantities
of the refuse of copper smeltings were found. This town should be
visited and examined with care by some of the members of our Associa
tion.' This was wiitten not far short of forty years ago; but I am not
aware that the Association has done anything positive as yet in this
matter.

\[aw\] According to Jenkins' *Bedd Gelert*, p. 300, the canoe was
subsequently sold for a substantial price, and nobody seems to know what
has eventually becomeofit. It is to be hoped thisis not correct.

\[ax\] See Holder's *Alt-celtischer Sprachschatz*, s.v,

Litavia.

\[ay\] For these notes I am indebted to Williams' *Dictionary of Eminent
Welshmen*, and to Rees' *Welsh Saints*, pp- 187,  191; for our Paulinus
is not yet recognized in the *Dictionary of Christian Boiography*. His
day was Nov. 22.

\[az\] There are two other inscriptions in South Wales which contain the
name Paulinus, one on a stone found in the neighbourhood of Port Talbot
in Glamorgan, reading *Hic iacit Cantusus Pater Paulinus*, which seems
to imply that Paulinus set up the stone to the memory of a son of his
named Cantusus. The other, found on the site of the extinct church of
LL&nwrthwl, near Dolau Cothi in Carmarthenshire, is a remarkable one in
a kind of hexameter to the following effect:--  
  
*Servatur fidaei patrieque semper amator  
Hic Paulinus iacit cultor pientsimus aequi.  
*  
Whether we have one or two or three Paulini in these inscriptions I
cannot say. Welsh writers, however, have made the name sometimes into
*Pawl* *Hén*, 'Paul the Aged,' but, so far as I can see, without rhyme
or reason.  
  
\[azz\] Since I chanced on this inscription my friend Professor Lindsay
of St. Andrews has called my attention to Plautus' Asinaria, 499 (II,
iv- 92), where one reads, *Periphanes Rhodo merrator dives*, 'Periphanes
a wealthy merchant of Rhodes'; he finds also *Aesculapius Epidauro*
(Arnobius? 278. 18), and elsewhere *Nepos Phlilippis* and

Priscus Vienna

\[ba\]  See Stokes *Patrick*, pp. 16, 412

\[bb\] This will give the reader some idea of the pre-Norman orthography
of Welsh, with *I* for the sound of *ll* and *b* for that of *v*.

\[bc\] The softening of *Cafall* to *Gafall* could not take place after
the masculine com, I a horn'; but it was just right after the feminine
earn, I a cairn.' So here corn is doubtless a colloquial corruption; and
so is probably the t at the end, for as M his frequently been reduced to
*ll*, as in *cyfaill*, I a friend,' from the older *cyfaillt*, in
Medieval Irish *comalta*, 'a foster brother or sister: the language has
sometimes reversed the process, as when one hears *hollt* for *holl*,
'all,' or reads *fferyllt*, 'alchemist, chemist,' *fferyll* from
*Vergilius*. The Nennian orthography does not much trouble itself to
distinguish between *I* and *ll* and even when *Carn Cabal* was written
the pronunciation was probably *Carn Gavall*, the mutation being ignored
in the spellingt which frequently happens in the case even of Welsh
people who never fail to mutate their consonants in speaking. Lastly,
though it was a dog that was called *Cafall*, it is remarkable that the
word has exactly the form taken by *caballus* in Welsh -. for *cafall*,
as meaning some sort of a horse, see Silvan Evans' *Geiriadur*.

\[bc\] An instance or two of *Trwyd* will be found in a note by Silvan
Evans in Skene's *Four Ancient Books of Wales*, ii. 393

\[bi\] See Reeves' note to the passage just cited in his edition of
Adamnan's

\[bj\] Here possibly one might mention likewise *Gilmin Troetu* or
*Troedifu*, 'Gilmin of the Black Foot,' the legendary ancestor of the
Wynns of Glyn Llifon, in Carnarvonsbire. So the name might be a
shortening of some such a combination as *Gilla- min*, 'the attendant of
*Min* or *Men*,' a name we have also in *Mocu-Min*, 'Min's Kin,' a
family or sept so called more than once by Adamnan. Perhaps one would
also be right in regarding as of similar origin the name of Gilberd or
Gilbert, son of Cadgyffro, who is mentioned in the Kulhwch, and in the
*Black Book*, fo. 14b': at any rate I am not convinced that the name is
to be identified with the Gillebert of the Normans, unless that was
itself derived from Celtic. But there is a discrepancy between *Gilmin*,
*Gilbert*, with unmutated *m* and *b*, and *Gilvaelhwy* with its
mutation consonant *v*. In all three, however, *Gil*, had it been Welsh,
would probably have appeared as *Gill*, as indicated by the name *Gilla*
in the Kulhwch (Oxford *Mabinogion*, p. 110), in which we seem to have
the later form of the old name *Gildas*. Compare such Irish instances as
Fiachna and Cera, which seem to imply stems originally ending in
*-asa-*s (masculine) and *-asd* (feminine); and see the *Journal of the
Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland*, 1899, p.  402.

\[bk\] An article in the Rennes *Dindsenchas* is devoted to Liath: see
the *Rev. Celtique*, xvi. 78-9. As to *Celtchar*, genitive *Celtchair*,
the name would seem to have meant 'him who is fond of concealment! The
Mabinogi form of the Welsh name is *Llwyl uab kil coet*, which literally
meant 'Ll. son of (him of) the Retreat of the Wood! But in the Twrch
Trwyth story, under a slightly different form of designation, we appear
to have the same person as *Llwydeu mab kel coet* and *Llwydeu mab kel
coet*, which would seem to mean 'Ll. son of (him of) the Hidden Wood.'
It looks as if the bilingual storyteller of the language transition had
not been able to give up the *cel* of Celtchar at the same time that he
rendered *celt* by *coet*, 'wood or trees,' as if identifying it with
cail: witness the Medieval Irish *caill*, 'a wood or forest,' dative
plural *cadlib*, derivative adjective *caillteamhuil*, 'silvester'; and
see Windisch's *Irische Texte*, p. 410, s. v. *caill*. the name seems to
be related to that of a man called *Cioccal*, A.M. 2530. Lastly,
Manawyddan, from whom the *Mabinogi* takes its name, is called *mab
Llyr*, 'son  
of Llyr,' in Welsh, and *Manannan mac Lir* in Irish. Similarly with his
brother Bran, and his sister Branwen, except that she has not been
identified in Irish story. But in Irish literature the genitive *Lir*,
as in *mac Lir*, 'son of Llyr,' is so common, and the nominative so
rare, that *Lir* came to be treated in late Irish as the nominative too;
but a genitive of the form *Lir* suggests a nominative-accusative *Ler*,
and as a matter of fact it occurs, for instance, in the couplet:--

  

Fer co n-dilur gnim dar ler  
Labraid Luath Lam ar Claideb \[bl\] .

A man of many feats beyond sea,  
Labraid swift of Hand on Sword is he.

\[bl\] Windisch's *Irische Texte*, p. 217, and the *Book of the Dun
Cow*, fo. 47 .

  
\[bm\] There has been a good deal of confusion as to the name Llyr: thus
for instance, the Welsh translations of Geoffrey of Monmouth make the
*Leir* of his Latin into Llyr, and the personage intended is represented
as the father of three daughters named Gonerilla, Regan, and Cordeilla
or Cordelia. But Cordelia is probably the Creurdilad of the *Black
Book*, p- 49b, and the Creieylat of the Kulhwch story (the Oxford
*Mabinogion*, pp.  113, 134), and her father was Llud Llawereint (=
Irish Nuada Airgetlám) and not Llyr. Then as to the *Leir* of Geoffrey's
Latin, that name looks as if given its form on the strength of the
*legr*- of *Legracraester*, the Anglo-Saxon name of the town now called
Leicester, of which William of Malmesbury (*Gesta Pontificum*,  176)
says, *Legrecestra est citvitas antiqua in Mediterraneis Anglis, a Legra
fluvio praeterfluente sic vocata*. Mr. Stevenson regards *Legra* as an
old name of the Soar, and as surviving in that of the village of Leire,
spelled *Legre* in Domesday. It seems to point back to a *Legere* or
*Ligere*, which recalls Liger, ' the Loire.'

  
\[bn\] I say in that case, as this is not quite conclusive; for Welsh
has an appellative *llyr* 'mare, aequor,' which may be a generalizing of
*Llyr*; or else it may represent an early *lerio*-s from *lero-s* (see
below), and our *Llyr* may possibly be this and not the Irish genitive
*Lir* retained as *Llyr*. That, however, seems to me improbable on the
whole.

\[bo\] Here it is relevant to direct the reader's attention to Nutt's
*Legend of the Holy Grail*, p. 28, where, in giving an abstract of the
*Petit saint Graal*, he speaks of the *Bran* of that romance, in French
*Bron*, nominative *Brons*, as having the keeping of the Grail and
dwelling 'in these isles of Ireland.'

  
\[bp\] The Don and Llyr groups are not brought into conflict or even
placed in contact with one another; and the reason seems to be that the
story-teller wanted to introduce the sons of Beli as supreme in Britain
after the death of Brin. Beli and his sons are also represented in
Maxen's Dream as ruling over Britain when the Roman conqueror arrives.
What is to be made of Beli may be learnt from *The Welsh People*, pp.
41-3. of the Tuatha Dé Danann, but within that community Lir was so
powerful that it was considered but natural that he should resent a
rival candidate being elected king in preference to him. So the Tuatha
Dé took pains to conciliate Lir, as did also their king, who gave his
daughter to Lir to wife, and when she died he gave him another of his
daughters \[bq\]; and with the treatment of her stepchildren by that
deceased wife's sister begins one of the three Sorrowful Tales of Erin,
known to English readers as the Fate of the Children of Lir. But the
reader should observe the relative position: the Tuatha Dé remain in
power, whLle the chLldren of Lir belong to the past, which is also the
sequence in the Mabinogion. Possibly this is not to be considered as
having any significance, but it is to be borne in mind that the Lir-Llyr
group is strikingly elemental in its patronymic Lir, Llyr. The
nominative, as already stated, was ler, 'sea,' and so Cormac renders mac
Lir by *filius maris*. How far we may venture to consider the sea to
have been personified in this context, and how early, it is impossible
to say. In any case it is deserving of notice that one group of Goidels
to this day do not say mac Lir, 'son of Lir,*'filium maris*, but always
'son of the Lir': I allude to the Gaels of the Isle of Man, in whose
language *Manannán mac Lir* is always *Mannanan mac y Lir*, or as they
spell it, *Lear*; that is to say 'Mannanan, son of the *ler*.' Manxmen
have been used to consider Manannan their eponymous hero, and first king
of their island: they call him more familiarly *Mannanan beg mac y
Lear*, 'Little Mannanan, son of the *ler*.' This we may, though no
Manxman of the present day attaches any meaning to the word fir or lear,
interpret as 'Little Mannanan, son of the Sea.' The wanderings at large
of the chLldren of Lir before being eclipsed by the Danann-Don group,
remind one of the story of the labours of Hercules, where it relates
that hero's adventures on his return from robbing Geryon of his cattle.
Pomponius Mela, ii. 5 (p. .50), makes Hercules on that journey fight in
the neighbourhood of Arles with two sons of Poseidon or Neptune, whom he
calls (in the accusative) Albiona and Bergyon. To us, with our more
adequate knowledge of geography, the locality and the men cannot appear
the most congruous, but there can hardly be any mistake as to the two
personal names being echoes of those of Albion and Iverion, Britain and
Ireland.

\[bq\] These things one learns about Lir from the story mentioned in the
text as the 1 Fate of the ChLldren of Lir,' as to which it is right,
however, to say that no ancient manuscript version is known: see M.
d'Arbois de jubainville's *Essai d'un Catalogne do la Litterature epique
de l'Irelande*, p. 8.

\[br\] See Skene's *Four Ancient Books of Wales*, ii. 303, also 108-9,
where the fragment of the poem as given in the *Book of Taliessin* is
printed. The line here quoted has been rendered in vol. i. 286, 'With
Matheu and Govannon,' which places the old pagan Gofannon in rather
unexpected company. A few lines later in the poem mention is made of a
*Kaer Gofammom*: where was that? Skene, in a note on it (ii. 452), says
that I In an old list of the churches of Linlithgow, printed by Theiner,
appears Vicapia de Gumamyn. The place meant is probably Dalmeny, on the
Firth of Forth, formerly called Dumanyn.' This is interesting only as
showing that Gumamyn is probably to be construed Dumamyn, and that
Dalmeny represents an ancient *Dun Mamann* in a neighbourhood where one
already has Clach Hamann, 'the stone of Manau,' and *Sliabh Mamann*,
'Mountain of Manau,' now respectively Clackmannan and Slamannan, in what
Nennius calls *Manan Guotodin*.

\[bs\] This occurred unrecognized and, therefore, unaltered by thse
scribe of the Nennian Pedigree no. xvi in the *Cymmrodor*, ix. 176, as
he found it written in an old spelling, *Louhen. map. Guid gen. map.
Caratauc. map. Cinbelim*, where Caradog is made father of Gwydion; for
in *Guid-gem* we seem to have the compound name which suggested Gwydiom.
This agnees with the fact that the Habinogi of Math treats Gwydion as
the father of Lew Lawgyffes; but the pedigree itself seems to have been
strangely put together.

The whole passage is worth quoting; it runs thus:

Erat autem simulacrum triceps, quad in sino corpore fria capita habens
Triglaus vocabatur; quad solum accipiens, ipsa capitella sibi
coharrentia, corpore comminuto, seum inde qasi pro tropheo asportavit,
et postea Romam pro argumento conversionis illoum transmisit.
