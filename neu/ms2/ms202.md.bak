# PRE- AND PROTO-HISTORIC FINNS

### CHAPTER VII

### CHARMS OF THE EAST FINNS, RUSSIANS, LETTS, ETC.

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have now to deal more especially with
the text of the Magic Songs, to explain their purport, to examine their
form, and compare them with the charms of the Eastern Finns, the
Russians, and other neighbouring nations. The text here translated is a
large part of the collection of Magic Songs edited and published by Dr.
Lönnrot in 1880, under the title of *Suomen Kansan muinaisia
Loitsurunoja*, 'Bygone Magic Songs of the Finns.' He did not collect
them all himself; some were taken down in the last century, and a very
few perhaps even earlier. They were found chiefly in the east and north
of Finland, especially in those localities where the peasants belong to
the Orthodox Church. Unfortunately the exact place where each was
collected is not specified, as the editor utilised sometimes as many as
twenty variants to form what he considered a complete whole. His main
reason for doing so was that no singer ever gives another man a magic
song complete; partly from forgetfulness; partly for fear lest it should
lose its efficacy if he gave it entire. Another reason was, that where
one singer uses a particular charm or song for one disease, such as
rickets, another recites it for itch or for

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

rash. This doubtless diminishes the value of Lönnrot's edition. It is
impossible to note the changes that have taken place in a given area
during the last hundred years or more, or to trace the diffusion of a
well-marked type from a definite centre. The form too suffers; none or
only a very few of the songs are exactly in the shape in which they were
sung—though I am not sure that this last defect is of very vital
importance. The singers, through failure of memory, did not recite them
precisely the same on each occasion, but unconsciously made small
changes. Having a considerable stock of songs, all of the same general
character, in their memories, the phrases of one song would often get
transported to another. There may have been a belief that each song was
a genuine formula to which nothing could be added and from which
nothing, not even three words, could be deducted without losing its
efficacy. But in practice it was otherwise. No half-civilised people has
any idea of absolute exactitude, and any fair approximation to a given
type of incantation or exorcism would undoubtedly pass muster. In a low
stage of culture, too, mere semblance and make-believe often stands on
the same level as reality; the shadow passes current for the substance.
If every one believed that each magic formula was invariable, such a
pretence would amply cover or counterbalance any irregularity the
exorcist might commit in his recitations.

According to their contents, Lönnrot classified and arranged the Magic
Songs most minutely under 233 headings. The general formulæ, common to
many charms, are given separately under eighteen heads, from § 1 to §
18; words of releasing or healing power under forty heads, § 19 to § 58;
fifty-one formulæ of a very varied kind from § 59

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

to § 109; seventy-three prayers, § 110 to § 182; fifty-one origins, §
183 to § 233. Under each of these 233 heads Lönnrot has often given a
number of variants, distinguished by the letters of the alphabet. Mainly
for reasons of space, though I have given specimens under each head, I
have curtailed the number of variants, yet those I have translated
amount to 639 magic songs, which is amply sufficient to allow one to
form an idea of the whole collection. To facilitate reference I have
numbered the different headings consecutively; in the original each of
the five great subdivisions is numbered separately, so that after § 18
my numbering no longer coincides with the Finnish text; so too in the
variants, I have lettered them, even after omitting some, in their
proper alphabetical order, regardless of whether they agree with the
original or not.

1\. Of the 'preliminary' formulæ the exorcist repeated one or more when
about to begin operations, especially when healing the sick. 2. The
'defensive' formulæ were directed against sorcerers, witches, and other
malevolent persons, and were specially necessary before setting out on a
journey. 3. Those 'against envy' prevented the envious from spoiling the
good work of the exorcist by their evil glances and other intrigues. 4.
The vengeance formulæ were to frighten away every kind of antagonist. 5.
The formulæ 'to discover the cause' were used in charming the sick, when
the origin of the malady was uncertain. 6. With the 'reparation for
harm' formulæ the exorcist or wizard, when dealing with a contusion,
ailment, or snake-bite, orders the person who caused all the pain and
suffering to come and cure the sufferer. 7. The formulæ 'against
inflammation' were useful in cases of snake-bite, contusions, and
inflammatory wounds. 8. 'Expulsion' charms were available

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

for many complaints and diseases, especially in those attributed to
bewitchment. 9. A 'posting' formula was recited after an expulsion or an
exorcism formula, and under the same conditions. 10. 'A pain or
sickness' formula was serviceable in allaying pains, smarts, and aches.
11. The 'reproaching' formula could be used in case of snake-bite,
toothache, and injuries caused by stone, fire, iron, frost, etc. 12.
'Falling into an ecstasy' was a formula for steeling the nerves while
conjuring the sick and removing obstacles. 13. A 'distress' formula was
of service in acute pain and in sudden attacks. 14. 'Boasting' was
efficacious in frightening away sorcerers, witches, the envious, and
other opponents; in steeling one's faculties, proclaiming one's power,
and gaining complete confidence. 15. Formulæ 'to still violence' were
good for assuaging severe pain in sickness. 16. 'Menacing' was used
after an expulsion formula, if the later had proved of no avail. 17. By
an 'exorcism,' disease, pain, curses, spell-sent injuries of every
description, were removed elsewhere. 18. After the recitation of a
formula 'to make fast,' the evil, which has been exorcised away, was
obliged to settle down in a given locality and there to remain
motionless. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

According to Dr. Lönnrot it is hard to say in what order the charms or
magic songs were recited, for if there was any order at all it was not
everywhere uniform. But if the patient was suffering from a wound or
open sore, a 'vapour' formula (§ 87) was repeated to prevent the hot
steam from hurting it; then, had it not been done previously, the
'preliminary and defensive' formulas as well as those 'against envy.'
These were followed, if the ailment or

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

injury was of a known kind, such as burns, frost-bites, stitch,
pleurisy, colic, rickets, rash, cancer, toothache, bites from snakes or
animals, cuts from iron, contusions from stones or timber, by the
recitations of their respective 'origins.' When the origin was not known
the formula 'to discover the cause' was said in order to discover it.
Then they continued the repetition in no particular order, just as the
exorcist remembered or regarded as most useful, the 'words of releasing
and healing power,' the 'reparation of harm,' 'against inflammation,'
and expulsion' formulæ, or any other from § 9 to § 18.

The 'origins,' it should be observed, have nothing to do with the origin
or cause of the disease or injury from which a patient was suffering. To
ascertain the latter, the wizard usually had recourse to divination (§
59 a). But when once he had learnt this he was able to recite the
'origin' or genealogy of the disease, or of the cause of harm, as glibly
and circumstantially as any Garter-King-at-Arms. This 'origin' or
pedigree was of an opprobrious, derisive, or contemptuous nature. The
object of the wizard was twofold. After describing the ancestry of the
cause of harm, and showing how ignominious, contemptible, and disgusting
it was, while the cause of harm was made out to be a good-for-nothing,
cowardly, and feeble wretch, the wizard tried either to shame it into
repairing the evil it had committed, or to make it clear that such a
helpless villain could have no chance of success against himself, who
feigned at times to be the son of Ukko, and was amply protected by
defensive clothing. The recital of the origin was of itself sufficient
to banish a spirit of evil; 'by pronouncing a deep origin, words that
are handed down, a needless evil is expelled' (210 a).

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

The work of healing was usually performed in the vapour-bath house,
which was heated as secretly as possible, so that no envious or
malevolent person should get wind of it and injure the operation. The
most suitable wood for heating the vapour was obtained from trees struck
by lightning, or that had been washed ashore by the wind (169 b); but in
cases of childbirth it was preferable to use splinters cut from the
hindmost beam of the barn; and if love was to be excited, then wood was
taken from two trees that had grown together, or had twisted round each
other like the tendril of hops round a pole. The water was drawn from a
stream flowing northwards, especially from the bubbly part of it if
rapids happened to be near at hand. Water from a natural spring was also
of service if scrapings of gold or silver had been dropped into it
thrice, a little each time. This was called 'buying the water.' For a
bath-switch they took triple-twigged sprigs of birch from the land of
three or nine rent-paying farms. These were termed 'exorcism-twigs.'
When it was a matter of throwing a 'love spell,' the bath-switch was
made of twigs growing at a place where three paths crossed, and in the
centre of the switch were inserted three root-shoots that had grown on
the north side of a tree. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) In the text
we also find that a bath-switch should be taken 'from a copse, near
three rapids, from the highest birch, and that wood of the rowan-tree
should be used for heating the bath' (133 c). Or the bath-switch may be
broken off at the brink of three angry rapids, while the bath is to be
heated with juniper from a sandy heath. The water is to be carried from
the Vento stream in a cup taken from near the moon, in a ladle belonging
to the sun (169 b).

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

To allow folklorists to compare in some small degree the charms and
exorcisms of surrounding peoples with those of the Finns I bring forward
a small selection. As those of the Esthonians, collected and translated
into German by Kreutzwald and Neus, are fairly accessible, and at any
rate are of the same character and in the same metre as the Finnish
Magic Songs, it is not necessary to reproduce them here. So too the few
prose charms of the Vepsas, given by Ujfalvy, are so entirely Russian
that they need not be transcribed. Though hardly worth giving, since
they all belong to a very late period, a few Swedish formulæ are
appended. Unfortunately I have never met with any large collection of
Swedish charms, and so cannot give better specimens than those below.
Russian charms and exorcisms are extremely numerous, some of them very
lengthy, and too long to quote. To omit them here is of less importance,
however, as they all seem to bear traces of literary origin, though the
ideas they embody may be much older. I have therefore given a few of the
shorter ones from a single collection. In 1894 Dr. Kobert of Dorpat
published 347 Lettish charms, of which I have taken about a fifth. The
post-classical examples, mostly from Marcellus, are interesting, as they
help to explain certain common features in Lettish, Russian,
and—probably by derivation—Finnish exorcisms. The eleven Mordvin charms
are interesting, but some of them have been unmistakably influenced by
Russian formulæ. All the Čeremisian and Votiak examples seem also to be
built up on an idea borrowed from the Russians, though, as I have never
seen any Cuvaš or Tatar formulæ, the idea may have been taken from a
Turkish-speaking people.

#### MORDVIN CHARMS.

*Against illness caused by a fall*.

1\. Sovereign lady of the earth, Ultáva! Perhaps Little John has fallen
on thy hand or foot, perhaps thou art angry with him, enraged at him. Or
maybe (he has fallen) on thy son, the great lord; perhaps he has been
knocked, perhaps thy son is enraged at Little John. Look! we are giving
him a present, 40 lbs. of copper, 40 lbs. of silver, and 100 rubles in
money. We will take a 3-kopek piece and scratch it with a knife as a
present to thy son. Perhaps Little John has fallen on thy daughter, the
lady, on thy daughter's hand or foot. It may be she has been knocked,
and perhaps she is enraged at Little John. We will give her a present,
we will buy (her) a copper ring.

Sovereign lady of the dwelling-place, Yurtava! Look! perhaps Little John
has fallen on thy hand or foot, perhaps thou art angry with him, perhaps
enraged at him.

I know not where Little John fell. An otter's claw will seek for the
place where he fell. Get to the place, look for it! I am sending the
otter's claw to look for the place where Little John fell. Don't trouble
thyself about the water, don't trouble about the bridge, thou swimmer
over broad waters, thou wader through deep mud, only mind that thou
lookest for the place. Look! on the place where Little John fell is a
white egg, a white hen laid it. We must take water, break the egg in it,
mix it with the water and wash the child in the water.

*Against burns*.

2\. It is not I that blow, God is blowing. A handless fellow lifted the
firewood, a footless fellow carried it here,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

a blind fellow went into the water, a breathless fellow blew up the
fire.

3\. On the hearth is a black girl, she wears a black cloth on her head,
black clothes, a black girdle, black gloves on her hands, black
bast-shoes on her feet, black bast-laces on her feet, black leggings on
her legs.

4\. Tokhantoyitsa, the black girl, carries her wood here, carries
running water, mitigates the burns, blows the burns away. When cold
water begins to boil (of itself), then will he (the patient) be burnt.

*Against frost-bite*.

5\. On a dust-heap is a white old man, he wears a white cap on his head,
white clothes, a white belt, white gloves on his hands, white trousers,
white bast-shoes on his feet, white bast-laces on his feet, white
leggings on his legs.

*Against worms*.

6\. Tatar plant, the thunder-nettle! I have come to you as a guest.
Sergei's cow has got the worms. In case you don't get rid of them I
shall visit you again. Now I shall only tear off your top, but I shall
come again, should you not get rid of them, and tear you up by the root,
I shall even dry up your roots.

*Against snake-bite*.

7\. Great snake, noxious snake! why have you bitten this animal? why was
it necessary for you to do so?—'The old snake sent me to devour the
animal.'—'Its flesh is not dainty, its blood is not pleasant.'

*Against violent pain in the joints, rheumatism.*

8\. Separate the painful illness, the rheumatism from the marrow in
their bones, from their bodies and muscles,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

their flesh and blood, their dark-red liver, and from the brain in their
heads! Separate the rheumatism from their cheeks, faces, eyes, eyebrows,
and cheek-bones! I separate the rheumatism from their breasts,
breast-bones, hands, wrists, and from the inside of their wrists. I
separate the rheumatism from the inside of their pubis and from its
marrow, from the roots of the hair and the tips of the hair. Assist us
and help us, Niške-pas! I drive away the rheumatism. Niške-pas drives
away, but Vere-pas separates.

*Against imprecation*.

9\. I heal from curses by blowing. There is a large, large, large hill;
on the top of the hill is an apple-tree; its roots stretch round the
earth; at the top are its branches, at the end of the branches its
leaves, and between the leaves are apples. When the cores of the apples
get counted, when its roots in the earth get counted, then let the curse
hold good, then let it return with a noise! There is a large, large,
large field; in the great field is a well, its water gushes forth like
silver, the uppermost part of its water flows like gold, over the earth
it casts its sand and dregs. When these are gathered together in one
place and counted and brought (back) to their place, then let the
imprecation hold good, then let it return with a noise.

*Against gripes, colic*.

10\. Behold! I dash to pieces the man's gripes, I cut his colic to
pieces. Grandfather Sorokin, grandfather Vid´aša, Mikhaila's wife,
grandmother, aunt Sekla, Gava's wife and daughter-in-law, the seven
wizards, see, these are blowing and they tell me (to blow). With your
favour I blow and I spit. From the other side of the great water a great
old woman has come, she has blown (the illness) away.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

*To staunch blood*.

11\. On the shore of the great water is a white stone; in the stone are
three girls on a white piece of felt. One sews with thread, the second
with silk, the third with silver tinsel. She will strengthen Vasya's
heart, will staunch his blood. When blood comes from the end of a dog's
member, then let it come from this place. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

#### ČEREMISIAN CHARMS.

stringing an 80 lb. weight on each eyelash, he is able to throw a

3\. As the cold earth lies heavy, so may also Vasili's body become
heavy!—As a great stone lies heavy on the ground, may Vasili's body,
becoming heavy, also lie!

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

*To give relief in sickness*.

4\. As a feather lies, so may Vasili's body become light!—As a hops
flower lies, so may Vasili's body become lighter and set itself in
motion!—As an owl with puffed-up feathers lies, so also may Vasili's
body stand forth swelling (with health).

*To gain abundance of corn*.

5\. As (the wind) brings snow in heaps and deposits it at the barn, so
may (it) deposit corn in heaps. As ants bring their ant-heaps near here,
so also may corn be brought near here!—As the sun, after making the
circuit of the sky and reaching its place, stays there, so also let the
corn come and stay.—When a stone melts, only then may (the corn) come to
an end! <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

*Against hoarseness*.

6\. The morning sun rises and approaches; if he (the sorcerer), stroking
the sunrise with both hands, can lick it with his tongue and push it
back in the winking of an eye, only then may he bewitch and throw spells
upon me.

*Against a snake's glance, i.e. swelling of the fingers*.

7\. Whenever the 'snake's glance,' chancing to be on the point of a
sharp steel sword, can jump about; only then at that very instant may it

the red earth, can cause it to flow in an instant; only then may my
blood flow!

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

As the red of dawn melts away, so may it (the evil) melt away.

*Against colic in horses*.

9\. From the gold blast-furnace issues the mass of gold throwing off
sparks with a crackling noise. If the Colic with a golden ladle can lay
it on (his own) bare heart and bare liver, and with patient endurance
can quietly take a seat, only then, at that very moment, may it attack
the horse.

*Against burns*.

10\. Fire, like a dry tree-stump in flames, comes rolling this way;
whenever it can rush into the river Ut, can char the river Ut, reduce it
to ashes, swallow and drink it up; only then, at that very moment, may
burns overwhelm me.

11\. As butter melts, as honey melts, as the morning mist melts away, as
the morning hoar-frost melts away, so may they (the burns) melt away in
an instant.

*Against an illness inflicted by the Russians*.

12\. When it is possible for a man to bring forty-one paths on forty-one
hills to one place and tie them in one knot; only then may he bewitch

twelve agues! Otherwise I will not give up this sick man!

If you divert from their course the full sun and the full moon, if you

them in your fist, then rove about eating this man! <span

on the broken boat of a Lauma (= witch).

13\. Flee, flee, holy virgins! I shall chase you, I shall overtake you,
I shall catch you, I shall whip you, I shall beat you; to me belongs the
dwelling-room, the table, the bed, and the cradle.

they wade, the drier (it gets); the further they wade, the drier (it

a golden besom and sweep up the blood of the black raven.

25\. The black snake flew through the air, spilling black blood—spilling
black blood, biting the slender nettles. The swamps are full of black

full of ice-heaps, the fields are full of ploughmen! Collect, O sea,
your ice—dear mother, your ploughmen!

26\. The alder grows in the forest, the alder grows in the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

forest; from the alder flows blood, from the alder flows blood. Let the

his waist and a steel tube in his hand. Flee, adders! flee, adders! They
will cut you in two crossways with the steel, they will hew you into
nine pieces.

32\. Don't sleep in the feather-grass, in the feather-grass, in the
feather-grass! Swamps and forests belong to you, the broad fatherland to
me. You ought to avoid the shadow of man, the ox-yoke, the handles of
the plough, the shadow of cattle! You have as many sins as the stars of
heaven; as many sins as the pebbles in the sea.

33\. The snake goes through the feather-grass with a white bar on its
back; it has the bar, I have a feather-grass. Let the (bitten) place
become as soft as feather-grass.

34\. Big snake, little snake! sleep in the vine-bush, don't

another variegated, the third brown. Open, copper gate.! that all may
crawl through.

of the willow thicket. Let the pain rot like a willow leaf! Let the
swelling subside like a heap of wool!

*Against sprains*.

38\. A billy-goat jumps over the fence, encounters an old harrow,—upsets
it,—let flesh turn towards flesh, let bone press against bone, let
health turn towards health; the ailment falls on the field as an old
harrow falls to pieces.

39\. Bone to bone, soft part to soft part, sinew to sinew, and red blood
through the middle.

40\. An old man walks along the street, leads by the hand a white mare,
crosses hills, crosses valleys—the hills break, the valleys break, oaks
break, steel breaks. The hills collide, the valleys collide; iron melts,
the steel melts; become as level as the floor. No groan, no moan, no
swelling;—become as well as it was.

*Against tumours, buboes*.

41\. I hew a willow, I hew a willow, I hew a willow—the lime-tree shot
forth between the roots of the oak. Let this man's body revive like the
lime leaves, let the swelling of dropsy vanish; stone (is its) name.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

*Against swellings*.

42\. Thrice nine red waggons are passing along the street, thrice nine
horses run before them, thrice nine drivers are in front; red caps, red
clothes, red whips, red gloves, red cord. They let their whips crack,
they let the swelling, the bulging, altogether disappear, that
suppresses (N.'s) malady, that suppresses (N.'s) malady.

43\. Thrice nine Pērkoni emerge from the sea with thrice nine iron
arrows—they dash the swelling under a stone,—the man remains in his
former state of health.

besom: dip in and sprinkle, dip in and sprinkle, dip in and sprinkle
that the swelling may be suffocated. Amen.

*Against boils, abscesses*.

45\. An old man is walking along the sea with a steel sword in his hand;
he cuts the boils in two. The boil runs into the deep sea, into the deep
sea-sand, into the deep sea-gravel;—there you must spin, there you must
twist.

46\. The boil is spinning between the door: there it spins, there it
twists. Hurry into the forest to the thickly-ramified willow-bush—there
you must spin, there must you twist; your grandfathers are there, your
grandmothers are there,—there you must spin, there must twist. God the
Father . . .

47\. The little old mother sits on the hill with a little basket in her
hand; in it is a ball of yarn; the ball unwinds, the boil discharges
itself, vanishes, passes into dust like a fuzz-ball.

48\. The little old mother sits on the hill with a ball of thread in her
bosom, a little dog is at her side; the ball

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

rolls to the bottom, the little dog retrieves it. These are the words
against boils that are appropriate for (N.). A little white stone in the
sea, a little white stone in the sea, a diamond knitting-needle in the
middle. Make haste (N.), exert yourself quickly to receive your health.

49\. I am a woman of iron, I have a tongue of steel: I split the boil
into nine pieces like an old mill-stone. Let it vanish, let it turn to
dust like an old fuzz-ball! In the name of Jesus—all is well (again).

50\. Boil, boil, howling boil! howl like a dog, coo like an egg (*sic*),
burst like an egg, like a barley-corn.

birch-leaf'!—without end, without end.

*Against erysipelas*.

52\. A woman sits at the foot of the hill with thrice nine balls of
string in her little basket. The ball rolls, the hills break and roll
down. A woman sits at the foot of the hill with thrice nine balls of
thread in her little basket: a black ball, blue ball, speckled ball, red
ball, white ball. Let the balls roll, the hills break and roll down.
Become as soft as a fuzz-ball (repeat twenty-seven times). God the
Father . . .

53\. The blue erysipelas, the white erysipelas, the red erysipelas,
vanish and disappear like the morning frost, like the waning moon, like
the shadow of the sun.

*Against caries of the bone*.

54\. Kindle, sun and moon! and let the evil die of hunger. And you,
bright stars! come to help. (This must be repeated twenty-seven times
over fine tobacco mixed with honey.)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

*Against cramp*.

55\. A black billy-goat cooks beef, lights a fire of ice; a black man
stays in the house, he wishes to contend with me. Go to the sea, in the
sea are two posts of ice; you can contend with these! God the Father . .
.

*At childbirth*.

56\. 'Wanderer,' 'wanderer,' stand up, seat yourself in the cart, take
the reins in your hands and drive home! Hasten, hasten to open the
'gate'; now nobles are driving along, like fish in the Dvina.

gentry are travelling—the 'golden sails' belly out. Our Father, which
art . . .

*Against convulsions in children*.

58\. The devil's mother and the devil's father drove to church in a
large waggon with black horses; three servants with thrice nine arrows
issue from the sea, and meet them at the cross roads. There they will
shoot thee, there thou wilt vanish, and turn to dust like an old
fuzz-ball, like the old moon! God the Father . . .

59\. An old master and an old woman in climbing hills get tired. So let
(N.) tire the evil that plagues him (the child), that tortures him, that
gives him convulsions, that tears him.

60\. The evil one breaks a rod. I weep at side of the road; hew the
pine, strike the fir; don't strike (N.); (N.) [is](errata.htm#0.md) given
by God, begotten of God. God the Father . . .

61\. Black men with iron teeth wished to bite (N.); all the small stones
of the sea came to help (N.).

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

62\. A black man walks along the street, he carries in his hand a black
cat. It was no black man, it was the merciful God himself. Lord Jesus
Christ help me. In the name . . .

63\. A black man and a black horse are standing in the willow thicket;
he has an iron cap, an iron shirt, and iron boots. The black man
vanishes, the black horse vanishes, the willow thicket vanishes. In the
name . . .

64\. A tiny little dog runs about day and night, barking and protecting
my cradle and my bairnie. God the Father . . .

65\. Four table-legs, four table-corners, four corners of the room;
three magpies; one black magpie, one parti-coloured magpie, one green
magpie; three black whelps, three black kittens, watch my little child.
God the Father . . .

*Against all sorts of evil*.

66\. An iron pig creeps through a hay-cock. You have crept in there,
remain there! Iron men! take iron forks and cast it (the pig) out. Lord
Jesus Christ, thou and thy Mother protect me! Our Father . . . (thrice).

67\. Go away to the sea, gnaw the white flint stones in the sea, don't
gnaw my body! Let all evils disappear like mist, like smoke, like the
morning frost in the sun, like the waning moon! Let my good health beam
like the sun in the sky!

68\. The black cock is sitting on the willow bush, the mother of the
devil (*Jods*) is coming with swords and pistols; there they will shoot
thee down, there thou wilt disappear. Hew into the pine, hew into the
fir, don't hew into the oak. God the Father . . .

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

*Charms relating to cow's milk*.

69\. (If the milk has been bewitched, one says:) Black men were mowing
hay on an island in the sea, with pitchy caps on their heads, and
dressed in coats of plaited withes.

70\. A hen is running to the stall with nine chicks; kind Maria went
behind with nine milk-pails. Three springs flow into the sea; may they
all flow into the udder of my cows. One-armed fellow, one-armed fellow!
stand at the cross-way and look out for who comes by, who comes by, who
runs by. One-armed fellow, one-armed fellow! look out for who comes, who
runs by, the witches and the sorceresses.

71\. Fly, witch, obliquely through the air, don't enter my farmyard. My
farmyard is tipped with iron, the rafters are made of scythes, the
rafters are made of scythes, the roofs are studded with needles, trimmed
with scythes, stuck with needles. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

#### GREAT RUSSIAN EXORCISMS.

*A love-spell*.

1\. I the servant of God (N.) begin, I shall go from door to door, from
the door to the gate, to the eastern side of the sea-ocean. In this sea
lies an island; on this island stands a post; on this post sit
seventy-seven brothers. They forge steel arrows day and night. I shall
address them in a whisper: 'Give me, ye seventy-seven brothers, the
arrow that is hottest and lightest.'

I shall shoot that arrow at the servant of God, the girl (N.) in the
left teat, lungs, and liver, that she shall lament

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

and weary (for me) by day, at night and at midnight, and shall not
dispel the feeling by eating and drinking.

I lock with a strong lock and (throw) the key into the water.—*From the
Government of Perm*.

*Against toothache*.

2\. Near a path, near a wood, stands a tree, under the tree lies a dead
body; St. Antipi goes past the corpse and says: 'Why, corpse, dost thou
lie down? do not thy teeth ache, do not thy ribs pain thee, do not worms
gnaw thee, art thou not bleeding?'

'They do not pain me.'

'Become, ye teeth, insensible to pain in the servant of God (N.), like
those in the dead body; O God, ratify it (with a ratification) stronger
than a stone.'—*From the Government of Vorónež*.

3\. The moon is in the sky, a bear in a forest, a corpse in a coffin;
when these three brothers come together, then let the servant's (N.)
teeth ache.'—*From Vorónež*.

4\. The new moon is in the sky, a grey horse is in a field, a pike is in
the sea; when these three meet, then let my teeth part company.—*From
Vorónež*.

5\. Go to a rowan-tree and gnaw it a little several times, repeating:
'Rowan-tree, Rowan-tree! cure my teeth! If thou wilt not cure them I
will gnaw thee all over.'—*From the Government of Kaluga*.

*Against gripes*.

6\. The wizard circles round the place where the gripes are felt with a
whetstone and makes a cross over the place with a table-knife while
praying, and crosses himself thrice: I cut, I cut off, I hew, I hew in
half, I cut, I split the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

gripes with a sharp knife. As a whetstone is worn down by steeled iron,
by steel, by iron, so let the inborn gripes in the white bone, in the
dark flesh, in the white body, wear down and wither for ever and ever.

Afterwards they wash the knife with water and give it to the patient to
drink, or with it they wash the sore place.—*From Pri-Argunsk in the
Transbaikal Province*.

*Against scrofula*.

7\. To be spoken over water and salt.

Thou must not remain here, thou must not live here; thou must remain in
swamps, on rotten trunks, behind dark forests, steep mountains, and
yellow sands. There thou must remain, there must live.—*From Vorónež*.

8\. To be said thrice over the oil with which the sore place is rubbed.

I begin by blessing myself, crossing myself, I shall go from door to
door into an open field. In the open field flow three rivers: the first
Varvareya, the second Nastaseya, the third Paraskoveya. These rivers
wash stumps, roots, white stones, and steep mountains, and yellow sand.
So let them wash the horrid red redness, the scrofulous scrofula, in the
servant of God (N.). O horrid red redness, roll, tumble out of his bones
and marrow, from the white body, from the hot blood, so that it shall
not pain nor pinch by day or night, for an hour, half an hour, a minute,
half a minute, for ever. Amen.—*Parish of Turensk, Valdai district,
Government of Novgorod*.

*Against fever and ague*.

9\. I the servant of God (N.) begin by blessing myself and crossing
myself. I shall go to the blue sea. On the blue sea

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

lies a white inflammable stone; on this stone stands God's throne; on
this throne sits the very holy Mother, holding in her small white hands
a white swan. She plucks, she pulls out of the swan a white feather.
Just as the white feather jumped and leaped back, so jump and leap back,
sever from the servant of God (N.), ye inborn fevers and inborn heat
from the poor raging head, the bright eyes, the dark brows, the white
body, the warm heart, the black liver, the white lungs, and from the
poor hands and feet.

If it came from the wind, let it go back to the wind; if it came from
the water, let it go back to the water; if it came from the forest, to
the forest let it return henceforth and for ever.—*From Pri-Argunsk,
Transbaikal Province*.

*Against hernia*.

10\. In an open field stands a moist oak; in the moist oak is an iron
man. And this iron man cannot be given to drink or be fed with bread or
salt or any fruit, but they have to feed this iron man with the hernia
from the heart of a living man, with hernia from under the breast, with
hernia from the navel. Also, in the blue sea ocean is a white stone, and
from this white stone issues a pretty girl, who advances to the servant
of God (N.) and takes from the servant of God the hernia in his navel,
the hernia in his heart, the hernia in his breast, and lays it on a silk
ribbon, and takes it down to the moist oak, to the iron man. This iron
man eats up and devours the hernia from the heart of this servant of
God, the hernia from under his breast, the hernia from his navel, and
then the iron man becomes satiated—*From eighteenth-century documents of
the Secret Chancery*.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

11\. To be repeated thrice, and each time the sore place is to be
bitten:

O hernia, hernia, thou hernia that growest in a pine forest, gnaw,
hernia! stumps, roots, and rough stones. Go for a walk, hernia, in an
open field; there thou canst walk at pleasure, there amuse thyself away
from the servant (N.) of God for ever and ever.—*From Turensk, Valdai
district, Government of Novgorod*.

*Against an abscess or boil*.

12\. Draw the middle finger of the right hand round a knot in the
woodwork of the door or window-post and repeat:

As a knot dries and withers up, so let the abscess dry and wither up. As
no fire comes from the finger, so let no nodule (come) from the
boil.—*Čerlinsk, Government of Perm*.

*Against bleeding*.

13\. On the sea Kiyan, on the island of Buyana, on a high stone stands a
tomb; in the tomb lies a pretty girl. Rise and get up, pretty girl! take
a sewing-needle, thread it with a silk thread, and sew up the bleeding
wound. Amen (thrice).—*From Alatịrsk, Government of Simbirsk*.

14\. On the sea Okiyan, on the island of Buyana, stands a small room; in
the small room are three girls. The first keeps needles, the second girl
makes thread, and the third sews up a bloody wound. Horse! thou art
chestnut; Blood! do not gush. Horse I thou art brown; Blood! do not
drip.—*From Government of Tula*.

15\. On the sea-ocean is the oceanic Tsar; under him is a brown horse.
Blood! don't drip up to this day and hour, till it is with my agreement
and decree, for ever and

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

ever. Amen. *From district of Valdai, Government of Novgorod*.

*Against snake-bite*.

16\. To be said thrice over damp aspen bark, which is then rubbed on the
wound.

From the sea, from behind a hill, from a white stone  issued a broad
feathered snake, and brought three iron pincers and took out the sting
of a black snake, of a little striped snake, of a copper snake, of a
blind-worm.—*Government of Tula*.

17\. Make a circle round the wound with the finger moistened with
spittle and say:

Fierce snake! thy house is in a cave, the servant (N.) of God is in a
village. Fierce snake! for thee it is a long way to the sea, and for the
servant of God (N.) it is high to the sky. Fierce snake! thou hast a
glowing coal in thy teeth and the servant of God has a white body. Do
not pain, do not swell, henceforth and for ever.—*From the Government of
Tula*.

*Against worms, grubs*.

18\. Saddles rattle, bits jingle, let the grub ride into empty sacks for
hops, for light goods, and fly across the sea. There grubs are holding a
wedding; a lamb, a barren cow, are being roasted; there is a fire for
grubs there, burning brimstone and boiling tar; run away, grubs, from
here across the sea!—*From a seventeenth-century MS., Government of
Perm.*

*Against a tired back*.

19\. A woman going out for the first time in harvest cuts the first
handful of rye and girds herself with it, saying:

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

As Mother Rye stood for a year and did not get tired, so let my back not
get tired from reaping.—*Government of Vologda*.

*Hunting spells*.

20\. A white hare runs, (it is) like white ice. On one side stands the
prophet Ilya with twelve servants: 'Servants, faithful servants, I lay
upon you no heavy task! take each of you an iron switch and drive
together from the Kama and the Volga, from the open field, from a wide
comfortable place, from hillocks and hills into the trap set by
(N.).'—*From the district of Tigrits in the Altai, in the Province of
Transbaikal*.

*Fishing*.

21\. When baiting a hook, say:

The fish is fresh, the bait is fat; nibble and bite and pull it to the
bottom.—*Government of Archangel*.

22\. Repeat thrice:

Fish, little fish! enter the mother net, the wide 'pair of
drawers.'—*From South Siberia*.

*On presenting a petition*.

23\. Before actually entering the house you must catch hold of the
handle of the door three times and say:

'As the handle of this door speaks, so let (N.) speak against me.'

up, be afraid of me.'—*From district of Yenisei*. <span

#### THE STRUCTURE OF THE MAGIC SONGS.

The Magic Songs and Charms are built up or composed of various simple
cells, or elements, each containing an idea which can be compressed into
a single sentence. The number of these simple elements, when stated in
the most general and comprehensive terms, amounts to about seventy-five,
though it will be sufficient to enumerate the limited number of ten.

1\. The exorcist or reciter of the song invokes or desires the help of a
stronger power, or invokes the aid of a helper; this last may be an
animal or an inanimate object.

2\. The spirit of disease, or whatever harm the exorcist or the reciter
has to counteract, is told what to do, or the helper is told what to do.

Each of these themes occurs over 260 times; with hardly

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

an exception, all the prayers or invocations for aid from a kindly
helper, from § 114 to § 182, contain these two ideas alone, though
worked out in a great variety of phraseology. In fact, they are the
simplest and most natural forms of incantation, merely amounting to the
invocation of a friendly helper and telling him what to do. In the
Mordvin, Lettish, and Russian examples we also find the invocation of
helpers, and with the two latter peoples the spirit of disease or other
harm-doer is instructed how to act.

3\. The origin or genealogy of the disease or cause of harm is
described, or its early state mentioned, *e.g.* § 183 to § 233. This
occurs 150 times, and is also found in Esthonian charms, which greatly
resemble those of the Finlanders, but not elsewhere, so far as I know.
Yet the string of abusive and contemptuous epithets, followed by no
further remarks, such as the Lettish charms 35, 51, might be taken to
represent the sort of germ from which the 'origins,' from one point of
view at least, came gradually into use.

4\. The exorcist, or speaker, relates a short story or fact, the
incidents of which are appropriate, and have reference to what he wishes
to do or to obtain. There are fifty-five examples of this in the Magic
Songs, e.g. 2 *d*, *f*, 8 *c*, *d*, 10 *a*—*d*, 12 *c*, 21 *a*, etc.;
five in the Mordvin charms; four in the Swedish; six in the
Post-Classical; ten in the Russian; and no less than 35 or 50 per cent.
in the Lettish charms. The recitation of the story was itself sufficient
for the purpose of banishing the evil, *e.g.* 2 *f*, 10 *b*—*d*, etc.;
Mordvin 3–5; Swedish 7–10; Post-Classical 6, 9–11; Russian 1, 2, 8, 9,
etc.; Lettish 5, 6, 11, etc.;—though sometimes it was followed by a
wish, a curse, or some other formula. In seven instances mentioned
above,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

vol. i. 358, stories are cited as a precedent why a similar result to
that in the stories should again occur. As the recitation of an
anecdote, which is sometimes reduced to a couple of sentences, is a very
indirect way of exorcising, especially when it is purposely composed of
*impossible* incidents, with the intention that they should react on the
disease or injury, and render it *impossible*, we have good reason to
suppose that it is not an original Finnish element. The frequency of
this method of procedure among the Letts is remarkable, and it is from
them the Finns have probably borrowed the usage; the Mordvins may have
taken the idea from the Russians.

5\. The exorcist, or other speaker, orders, advises, or hints to the
spirit of disease, or cause of pain, to remove to a definite place.
There are thirty-seven examples of this very simple formula, e.g. 10
*a*, 17 *a*, *d*—*f*, *m*—*p*, *r*—*u*, *w*.

6\. An inducement to depart is offered to the cause of the ailment or
injury. Of this there are twenty-four examples, many of which have been
mentioned in vol. i. 349. In the Russian list, No. 18, grubs are tempted
to retire by the inducement of a wedding, held at a great distance,
where a lamb and a cow are being roasted; and in the Lettish No. 46 a
boil or abscess is to hurry off to the forest, where it will find its
grandfather and grandmother, quite as in some of the Finnish examples.
The notion of offering a bribe or bait of some kind to an enemy is so
natural that, as regards the Finns, it may have arisen spontaneously.

7\. The exorcist or the reciter describes or invokes the assistance that
can be rendered by animals, birds, trees, or stones. There are twenty
examples, e.g. 2 *c*, 14 *g*, *h*, 16 *a*, 17 *d*, *x*, *etc*.

8\. If the disease or injury came from a certain place or

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

person, it is to return there. This occurs nineteen times, e.g. 17 6,
*c*, *g*, *j*—*l*, *q*, *v*, *x*—*z*, 24, etc. It is also found in the
Russian list, No. 9.

9\. The speaker boasts his powers, or relates what he has done or will
do. This theme occurs seventeen times, e.g. 14 *a*—*i*, 16 *b*, 17 *u*,
etc., and is also found in the Votiak, No. 17, 24; Lettish, No. 49.

10\. Something impossible is to happen before the particular evil
dreaded is to be effected, or to take place. With the Votiaks twenty-two
out of twenty-five charms are based upon this conception; with the
Čeremis ten out of fourteen; with the Mordvins three out of eleven; with
the Russians two out of twenty-three; with the Letts and Finns it does
not occur at all. The nearest approach to it with the latter people is
to be found in the formula 'to make fast,' 18 *a*, *b*, where the evils
exorcised to a certain place are to remain till something impossible
happens. It is possible that the East Finns have borrowed this mode of
exorcising from the Russians, though the former have elaborated the
idea, and venture on far bolder and quainter impossibilities than the
Russians. The Čeremisian idea of making a ladder of one's ribs to climb
up to heaven (No. 14), as a hyperbole, is decidedly original.

In smaller details there are also correspondences between the Finnish
and some of the other groups. In the Mordvin No. 8 the exorcist seems to
identify himself with the god Niške-pas, just as the Finnish wizard
calls himself 'the son of Ukko, the father above, the observant man of.
the sky' (176 *l*). Again, an ailment of some kind or other is told to
injure something inanimate instead of a human being. This injunction is
very baldly stated in the Lettish No. 1, 34, 68; but it is worked out in
considerable detail in the

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Finnish examples.
'Let tumours grow on trees, on the earth excrescences, watery blisters
upon shoots, boils charged with blood on sapling firs, not on a human
being's skin, on the body of a mother's son (146 *a*). Rather than
freezing me . . . nip willow-roots, pain roots of birch, shake alder
roots, smash aspen roots, freeze swamps, freeze fields, freeze Kalma's
rocks (93 *c*).'

#### THE AGE OF THE MAGIC SONGS.

It is far from certain that in the first three or four periods the Finns
had any magic formulæ at all. In those early times, judging from what we
know of the Ugrian groups and the Samoyedes, in a case of grave
sickness, an appeal was made to a wizard, first, to ascertain the cause
of the illness, and, secondly, to find out what offering would most
likely propitiate the offended household or other god. If they had any
formulae at all, they would be of a very simple character: an appeal to
some kindly helper, such as the household or the private god, to free
them from their trouble, and this would be far more of the nature of a
prayer than of a magic incantation. Indeed, the notion of magic in the
modern sense of the word did not exist. There was no thought of
attaining an object by other than what seemed thoroughly natural means,
and there was no supreme god whose prerogatives would be infringed
either by the words used, or by any sympathetic magical procedure that
accompanied the words and incantations. The great mass of the Magic
Songs belongs to comparatively recent times, and many have been composed
since the introduction of Christianity in the twelfth century.
Nevertheless they contain much older elements, and the mental

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

attitude of the composer is often decidedly archaic. The word *runo*, 'a
song or ballad,' originally a 'mysterious song,' came into use, as we
have seen, in the fifth period, and the earliest germs of magic songs
perhaps may be referred to that epoch, though the present regular metre
is doubtless later. It seems to me that the Magic Songs would receive
their greatest development in the interval between pure heathenism and
pure Christianity. By this time the mental progress and the material
civilisation of the Finns was very considerable, and nearly if not quite
on a par with their Swedish, Slav, and Lettish neighbours. This was
accompanied, as is generally the case, with a certain amount of
scepticism and recklessness. A power that was formerly supposed to exist
solely among professional wizards and wise men was now claimed by
laymen. People now began to be their own wizards, to recite their own
songs; divining was performed with a common sieve, not with a magic
drum; charming by means of versified incantations became vulgarised, so
to speak. Instead of holding one or two great public festivals at the
opening of the hunting and fishing season, when public religious
ceremonies were held and sacrifices offered for the success of the
expeditions, every fisherman and hunter recited his own private magic
song for himself as occasion required. Every house-father and
house-mother knew a few metrical charms that protected their few cows
and horses as they grazed in the forest against bears and wolves, or
their rye crops from the ravages of insects and frost. The housewife or
her near neighbour had always a song ready for every sick child,
whatever the complaint might be, for with the increase of civilisation
far greater care was taken of the children than in the old days. No
doubt there were

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

still professional wizards and wise men about the country, but their
office was not hereditary—it was thrown open, as it were, to public
competition; the successful became renowned, the unsuccessful fell back
into the ranks of the laymen. At least, an explanation of this sort
seems best to account for the frequent interrogations and hesitation on
the part of the exorcist, which in the case of a professional would
hardly occur. Perhaps the origins' are of lay origin, and developed out
of a practice of vilifying a man and his ancestors in everyday life. The
more or less poetic, sometimes almost lyrical, form of expression,
especially in the formulæ 'to benefit cattle'; the similes, the
metaphors, and figurative expressions, collected at the end of the
chapter, seem to show that the Magic Songs are in a great measure the
outcome of a great many minds of people of various vocations, not of a
professional class of wizards, sorcerers, and dealers in the black art.

#### POETIC ELEMENT—SIMILES.

In spite of their purely practical purpose, the Magic Songs, besides
possessing regular metre, are sometimes embellished by similes.
Doubtless they belong to the latest period, but are not the less
interesting as they seem to be of purely native growth, and not to be
due to external influence. They are drawn for the most part from natural
phenomena, from the animal and vegetable kingdom, or from artificial
products and objects made by man's hand.

*Firmness, rigidity, steadiness*.

Like a wall, stand still, O Blood, remain like a fence, O Foaming Gore,
like a yellow iris in the sea, like a sedge

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

amid the moss; stand like a stake in a morass, a bar of iron in a rock,
a stone in a raging cataract, a flag (stone) on a ploughed field's edge
(55 d).

(59 a.)

piece of barley dough (26 a).

*Helpless movement combined with expansion*.

(Thou wast not great) when in the furnace thou didst toss, like summer
butter didst flop about, like wheaten dough expand in the raging place
of fire (40 b).

The iron stretched out like pap, bubbled up like slag,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

expanded like wheaten dough, like rye-meal dough, in the smith's huge
fire (214 a).

hill (176 j, and 211 b).

on the sea, thy body is whiter still (80 a).

Cause her (a marriageable girl) to glisten like the moon, to sparkle

winter hare (89 b).

*Height, size*.

A stone as high as a church, a flagstone thick as a tower (28 a).

A stone as high as a church, a flagstone thick as a hill (99 b).

My dogs have eyes as large as a bridle-ring, my dogs have ears as large
as a water-lily on a lake, my dogs have teeth as sharp as an Esthonian
scythe, my dogs have tails as thick as the most lovely forest fir (89
b).

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

*Lowliness, insignificant condition*.

Who knew a stone to be a stone, when it was like a barley-corn, rose
from the earth like a strawberry, from the side of a tree like a
bilberry? (196 b.)

(Speaking of a tree.) Thou wast not great when thou rose from a knoll,
from the earth emerged like a strawberry, like an arctic bramble in the
woods (38 a).

He (a water-Hiisi) reached the land like a strawberry, fell down like a
lump of wheaten dough (206 b).

(The fir) sprang from the earth like a strawberry, like a rooted plant
with unbending head; it grew like a two-branched plant, like a
three-branched plant shot up (212 g).

(The fir,) like a strawberry, sprouted from the earth, like an arctic
bramble—in the woods (212 g).

(Bent grass.) It rose from the earth like a strawberry, grew up like a
three-branched plant (220).

*Unceremonious treatment*.

Hops . . . was poked into the ground, ploughed into the ground like a
little snake, was like an ant thrown down at the side of the well of
Kaleva (209 a).

*Tightness and softness*.

(To a dog.) May thy jawbones be as tightly closed as a flax-break lid is
tightly closed; may thy teeth be as soft as (the husks) in my fist are
soft (72 a).

*A minimum of benefit*.

Just this much they got out of me, what an axe gets from a stone, a
borer from a rock, a stump from slippery ice, or death from an empty
room (14 b).

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

*Plenty, abundance*.

There heads are (plentiful) as hills, hair (plentiful) as withered grass
(17 o).

*Speedy death*.

Like a cockroach thou shalt die forthwith (62).

*Dishonour, inglorious death*.

Well, wretch, thou brok’st thine oath, didst eat thine honour like a dog
(40 b).

He died with the glory of a dog, he fell with the honour of a whelp (228
b).

 

Besides similes such as the above, we also find more or less quaint
remarks, not devoid of humour; sometimes a pun or an example of drawing
the long bow.

The forest deities are addressed as follows:—Bind up their wings with
twine, confine their instruments of flight, entwine their legs with
string, roll up their toes in wax, that with their wings they cannot
fly, that with their feet they cannot run, till I am ready with my bow
(136 a).

Hey! Love, wake up! O Love, arise! without being lifted by a cord,
without being hauled by a tarry rope (133 f).

The same words are addressed by a housewife to yeast to make it rise:
'Rise, Yeast, when being raised . . . without being raised by ropes,
without being hauled by tarry cords. The sun and moon have risen both,
yet thou hast not begun to rise' (74).

’Tis better a stone should scream, ’tis better a flagstone yell, than
one of a woman born, or by a creature brought

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

to birth (128 d). A stone weeps not at pain, nor a flag bewail its
sufferings, though many should be laid on it, be flung on it
unstintingly (17 t). The pun is rare, but it was not tabooed: Mourning
(*suru*) I have for a morning meal (*suurus*), 89 e.

Exaggeration is more common: The brutal fellow broke it (an aspen tree)
through, completely shattered it in two; with the salve he anointed it .
. . the aspen was made whole again, became e’en better than before

(232 a). A swallow for a whole day flew from the withers to the end of
the tail, a squirrel for a whole month ran between the horns of the ox,
yet still it never reached the end, it never came indeed so far (232 g).

#### FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS, METAPHORS, EPITHETS.

The familiar language of the illiterate classes of society, the slang of
the man in the street all over Europe, is largely composed of figurative
expressions and metaphors. Having no literature, for the most part,
almost their only intellectual excitement, and the sole exercise of
their wit and fancy, consist in the invention of new ways of saying old
things. When worn-out and stale, these expressions are replaced by newer
ones. Sometimes, too, allusive words are used to avoid pronouncing the
proper word, either because it is unlucky to do so, or from notions of
delicacy and modesty. It is not surprising then that the inventors or
reciters of the Magic Songs, being themselves quite illiterate, found
pleasure and satisfaction in intercalating expressions which hinted at
what they meant to say in an indirect or roundabout fashion.
