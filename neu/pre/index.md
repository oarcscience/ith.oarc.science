# The Prose Edda

### of Snorri Sturlson

## Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur \[1916\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Prose Edda is a text on Old Norse Poetics, written about 1200 by the
Icelandic poet and politican Snorri Sturlson, who also wrote the
[Heimskringla](../heim/index). The Prose Edda contains a wide variety of
lore which a Skald (poet) of the time would need to know. The text is of
interest to modern readers because it contains consistent narratives of
many of the plot lines of Norse mythology. Although Snorri was a
Christian, he treated the ancient Pagan mythology with great respect. To
this end, Snorri created a quasi-historical backstory for the Norse
Gods. Hence the Prose Edda is of interest because it contains one of the
first attempts to devise a rational explanation for mythological and
legendary events. It is also notable because it contains fragments of a
number of manusripts which Snorri had access to, but which are now lost.
