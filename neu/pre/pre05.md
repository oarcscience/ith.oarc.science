# SKÁLDSKAPARMAL

## THE POESY OF SKALDS\[1\]

I. A certain man was named Ægir, or Hlér. He dwelt on the island which
is now called Hlér's Isle,\[2\] and was deeply versed in black magic. He
took his way to Ásgard, but the Æsir had foreknowledge of his journey;
he was received with good cheer, and yet many things were done by
deceit, with eye-illusions. And at evening, when it was time for
drinking, Odin had swords brought into the hall, so bright that light
radiated from them: and other illumination was not used while they sat
at drinking. The n the Æsir came in to their banquet, and in the
high-seats sat them down those twelve Æsir who were appointed to be
judges; these were their names: Thor, Njördr, Freyr, Týr, Heimdallr,
Bragi, Vídarr, Váli, Ullr, Hœnir, Forseti, Loki; and in like manner the
Ásynjur: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Idunn, Gerdr, Sigyn, Fulla, Nanna. It
seemed glorious to Ægir to look about him in the hall: the wainscottings
there were all hung with fair shields; there was also stinging mead,
copiously quaffed. The man seated next to Ægir was Bragi, and they took
part together in drinking and in converse: Bragi told Ægir of many
things which had come to pass among the Æsir.

He began the story at the point where three of the Æsir, Odin and Loki
and Hœnir, departed from home and were wandering over mountains and
wastes, and food was hard to find. But when they came down into a
certain dale, they saw a herd of oxen, took one ox, and set about
cooking it. Now when they thought that it must be cooked, they broke up
the fire, and it was not cooked. After a while had passed, they having
scattered the fire a

\[1. Usually translated "Poetical Diction."

2\. Now Læssø.\]

{p. 90}

second time, and it was not cooked, they took counsel together, asking
each other what it might mean. Then they heard a voice speaking in the
oak up above them, declaring that he who sat there confessed he had
caused the lack of virtue in the fire. They looked thither, and there
sat an eagle; and it was no small one. Then the eagle said: "If ye are
willing to give me my fill of the ox, then it will cook in the fire."
They assented to this. Then he let himself float down from the tree and
alighted by the fire, and forthwith at the very first took unto himself
the two hams of the ox, and both shoulders. Then Loki was angered,
snatched up a great pole, brandished it with all his strength, and drove
it at the eagle's body. The eagle plunged violently at the blow and flew
up, so that the pole was fast to the eagle's back, and Loki's hands to
the other end of the pole. The eagle flew at such a height that Loki's
feet down below knocked against stones and rock-heaps and trees, and he
thought his arms would be torn from his shoulders. He cried aloud,
entreating the eagle urgently for peace; but the eagle declared that
Loki should never be loosed, unless he would give him his oath to induce
Idunn to come out of Ásgard with her apples. Loki assented, and being
straightway loosed, went to his companions; nor for that time are any
more things reported concerning their journey, until they had come home.

But at the appointed time Loki lured Idunn out of Ásgard into a certain
wood, saying that he had found such apples as would seem to her of great
virtue, and prayed that she would have her apples with her and compare
them with these. Then Thjazi the giant came there in his eagle's plumage
and took Idunn and flew away with her, off into Thrymheimr to his abode.

{p. 91}

But the Æsir became straitened at the disappearance of Idunn, and
speedily they became hoary and old. Then those, Æsir took counsel
together, and each asked the other what had last been known of Idunn;
and the last that had been seen was that she had gone out of Ásgard with
Loki. Thereupon Loki was seized and brought to the Thing, and was
threatened with death, or tortures; when he had become well frightened,
he declared that he would seek after Idunn in Jötunheim, if Freyja would
lend him the hawk's plumage which she possessed. And when he got the
hawk's plumage, he flew north into Jötunheim, and came on a certain day
to the home of Thjazi the giant. Thjazi had rowed out to sea, but Idunn
was at home alone: Loki turned her into the shape of a nut and grasped
her in his claws and flew his utmost.

Now when Thjazi came home and missed Idunn, he took his eagle's plumage
and flew after Loki, making a mighty rush of sound with his wings in his
flight. But when the Æsir saw how the hawk flew with the nut, and where
the eagle was flying, they went out below Ásgard and bore burdens of
plane-shavings thither. As soon as the hawk flew into the citadel, he
swooped down close by the castle-wall; then the Æsir struck fire to the
plane-shavings. But the eagle could not stop himself when he missed the
hawk: the feathers of the eagle caught fire, and straightway his flight
ceased. Then the Æsir were near at hand and slew Thjazi the giant within
the Gate of the Æsir, and that slaying is exceeding famous.

Now Skadi, the daughter of the giant Thjazi, took helm and birnie and
all weapons of war and proceeded to Ásgard, to avenge her father. The
Æsir, however, offered her reconciliation and atonement: the first
article was that she should

{p. 92}

choose for herself a husband from among the Æsir and choose by the feet
only, seeing no more of him. Then she saw the feet of one man, passing
fair, and said: "I choose this one: in Baldr little can be loathly." But
that was Njördr of Nóatún. She had this article also in her bond of
reconciliation: that the Æsir must do a thing she thought they would not
be able to accomplish: to make her laugh. Then Loki did this: he tied a
cord to the beard of a goat, the other end being about his own genitals,
and each gave way in turn, and each of the two screeched loudly; then
Loki let himself fall onto Skadi's knee, and she laughed. Thereupon
reconciliation was made with her on the part of the Æsir. It is so said,
that Odin did this by way of atonement to Skadi: he took Thjazi's eyes
and cast them up into the heavens, and made of them two stars.

Then said Ægir: "It seems to me that Thjazi was a mighty man: now of
what family was he?" Bragi answered: "His father was called Ölvaldi, and
if I tell thee of him, thou wilt think these things wonders. He was very
rich in gold; but when he died and his sons came to divide the
inheritance, they determined upon this measure for the gold which they
divided: each should take as much as his mouth would hold, and all the
same number of mouthfuls. One of them was Thjazi, the second Idi, the
third Gangr. And we have it as a metaphor among us now, to call gold the
mouth-tale of these giants; but we conceal it in secret terms or in
poesy in this way, that we call it Speech, or Word, or Talk, of these
giants."

Then said Ægir: "I deem that well concealed in secret terms." And again
said Ægir: "Whence did this art, which ye call *poesy*, derive its
beginnings?" Bragi answered: "These were the beginnings thereof. The
gods had a dispute

{p. 93}

with the folk which are called Vanir, and they appointed a peace-meeting
between them and established peace in this way: they each went to a vat
and spat their spittle therein. Then at parting the gods took that
peace-token and would not let it perish, but shaped thereof a man. This
man is called Kvasir, and he was so wise that none could question him
concerning anything but that he knew the solution. He went up and down
the earth to give instruction to men; and when he came upon invitation
to the abode of certain dwarves, Fjalar and Galarr, they called him into
privy converse with them, and killed him, letting his blood run into two
vats and a kettle. The kettle is named Ódrerir, and the vats Són and
Bodn; they blended honey with the blood, and the outcome was that mead
by the virtue of which he who drinks becomes a skald or scholar. The
dwarves reported to the Æsir that Kvasir had choked on his own
shrewdness, since there was none so wise there as to be able to question
his wisdom.

"Then these dwarves invited the giant who is called Gillingr to visit
them, and his wife with him. Next the dwarves invited Gillingr to row
upon the sea with them; but when they had gone out from the land, the
dwarves rowed into the breakers and capsized the boat. Gillingr was
unable to swim, and he perished; but the dwarves righted their boat and
rowed to land. They reported this accident to his wife, but she took it
grievously and wept aloud. Then Fjalar asked her whether it would ease
her heart if she should look out upon the sea at the spot where he had
perished; and she desired it. Then he spoke softly to Galarr his
brother, bidding him go up over the doorway, when she should go out, and
let a mill-stone fall on her head, saying that her weeping grew
wearisome to him; and even so he did.

{p. 94}

"Now when the giant Suttungr, Gillingr's son, learned of this, he went
over and took the dwarves and carried them out to sea, and set them on a
reef which was covered at high tide. They besought Suttungr to grant
them respite of their lives, and as the price of reconciliation offered
him the precious mead in satisfaction of his father's death. And that
became a means of reconciliation between them. Suttungr carried the mead
home and concealed it in the place called Hnitbjörg, placing his
daughter Gunnlöd there to watch over it. Because of this we call poesy
Kvasir's Blood or Dwarves' Drink, or Fill, or any kind of liquid of
Ódrerir, or of Bodn, or of Són, or Ferry-Boat of Dwarves--since this
mead brought them life--ransom from the reef--or Suttungr's Mead, or
Liquor of Hnitbjörg."

Then Ægir said: "These seem to me dark sayings, to call poesy by these
names. But how did ye Æsir come at Suttungr's Mead?" Bragi answered:
"That tale runs thus: Odin departed from home and came to a certain
place where nine thralls were mowing hay. He asked if they desired him
to whet their scythes, and they assented. Then he took a hone from his
belt and whetted the scythes; it seemed to them that the scythes cut
better by far, and they asked that the hone be sold them. But he put
such a value on it that whoso desired to buy must give a considerable
price: nonetheless all said that they would agree, and prayed him to
sell it to them. He cast the hone up into the air; but since all wished
to lay their hands on it, they became so intermingled with one another
that each struck with his scythe against the other's neck.

"Odin sought a night's lodging with the giant who is called Baugi,
Suttungr's brother. Baugi bewailed his husbandry, saying that his nine
thralls had killed one another,

{p. 95}

and declared that he had no hope of workmen. Odin called himself
Bölverkr in Baugi's presence; he offered to undertake nine men's work
for Baugi, and demanded for his wages one drink of Suttungr's Mead.
Baugi declared that he had no control whatever over the mead, and said
that Suttungr was determined to have it to himself, but promised to go
with Bölverkr and try if they might get the mead. During the summer
Bölverkr accomplished nine men's work for Baugi, but when winter came he
asked Baugi for his hire. Then they both set out for Suttungr's. Baugi
told Suttungr his brother of his bargain with Bölverkr; but Suttungr
flatly refused them a single drop of the mead. Then Bölverkr made
suggestion to Baugi that they try certain wiles, if perchance they might
find means to get at the mead; and Baugi agreed readily. Thereupon
Bölverkr drew out the auger called Rati, saying that Baugi must bore the
rock, if the auger cut. He did so. At last Baugi said that the rock was
bored through, but Bölverkr blew into the auger-hole, and the chips flew
up at him. Then he discovered that Baugi would have deceived him, and he
bade him bore through the rock. Baugi bored anew; and when Bölverkr blew
a second time, then the chips were blown in by the blast. Then Bölverkr
turned himself into a serpent and crawled into the auger-hole, but Baugi
thrust at him from behind with the auger and missed him. Bölverkr
proceeded to the place where Gunnlöd was, and lay with her three nights;
and then she gave him leave to drink three draughts of the mead. In the
first draught he drank every drop out of Ódrerir; and in the second, he
emptied Bodn; and in the third, Són; and then he had all the mead. Then
he turned himself into the shape of an eagle and flew as furiously as he
could; but when Suttungr saw the eagle's

{p. 96}

flight, he too assumed the fashion of an eagle and flew after him. When
the Æsir saw Odin flying, straightway they set out their vats in the
court; and when Odin came into Ásgard, he spat up the mead into the
vats. Nevertheless he came so near to being caught by Suttungr that he
sent some mead backwards, and no heed was taken of this: whosoever would
might have that, and we call that the poetaster's part.\[1\] But Odin
gave the mead of Suttungr to the Æsir and to those men who possess the
ability to compose. Therefore we call poesy Odin's Booty and Find, and
his Drink and Gift, and the Drink of the Æsir."

Then said Ægir: "In how many ways are the terms of skaldship variously
phrased, or how many are the essential elements of the skaldic art?"
Then Bragi answered: "The elements into which all poesy is divided are
two." Ægir asked: "What two?" Bragi said: "Metaphor and metre." "What
manner of metaphor is used for skaldic writing?" "Three are the types of
skaldic metaphor." "Which?" "Thus: \[first\], calling everything by its
name; the second type is that which is called 'substitution;' the third
type of metaphor is that which is called 'periphrasis,' and this type is
employed in such manner: Suppose I take Odin, or Thor, or Týr, or any of
the Æsir or Elves; and to any of them whom I mention, I add the name of
a property of some other of the Æsir, or I record certain works of his.
Thereupon he becomes owner of the name, and not the one whose name was
applied to him: just as when we speak of Victory-Týr, or Týr of the
Hanged, or Týr of Cargoes: that then becomes Odin's name: and we call
these periphrastic names. So also with the title Týr of the Wain.\[2\]

\[1. See Burns, The Kirk's Alarm, 11th stanza, for a similar idea.

2\. Týr. See discussion in Cl.-Vig., p. 647. This word as a proper name
refers {footnote p. 97} to the one-armed God of War; but, especially in
compounds, it has the sense of God, the God, and is usually applied to
Odin. The compounds mentioned here by Snorri are all epithets of Odin.
See Gylfaginning, p. 30.\]

{p. 97}

"But now one thing must be said to young skalds, to such as yearn to
attain to the craft of poesy and to increase their store of figures with
traditional metaphors; or to those who crave to acquire the faculty of
discerning what is said in hidden phrase: let such an one, then,
interpret this book to his instruction and pleasure. Yet one is not so
to forget or discredit these traditions as to remove from poesy those
ancient metaphors with which it has pleased Chief Skalds to be content;
nor, on the other hand, ought Christian men to believe in heathen gods,
nor in the truth of these tales otherwise than precisely as one may find
here in the beginning of the book.

II\. Now you may hear examples of the way in which Chief Skalds have
held it becoming to compose, making use of these simple terms and
periphrases: as when Arnórr Earls' Skald says that Odin is called
Allfather:

Now I'll tell men the virtue  
Of the terrible Jarl;  
Allfather's Song-Surf streams;  
Late my sorrows lighten,

Here, moreover, he calls poesy the Song-Surf of Allfather. Hávardr the
Halt sang thus:

Now is the flight of eagles  
Over the field; the sailors  
Of the sea-horses hie them  
To the Hanged-God's gifts and feasting.

{p. 98}

Thus sang Viga-Glúmr:

With the Hanged-God's helmet  
The hosts have ceased from going  
By the brink; not pleasant  
The bravest held the venture.

Thus sang Refr:

Oft the Gracious One came to me  
At the holy cup of the Raven-God;  
The king of the stem-ploughed sea's gold  
From the skald in death is sundered.

Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:

And Sigurdr,  
He who sated the ravens  
Of Cargo-God  
With the gore of the host  
Of slain Haddings  
Of life was spoiled  
By the earth-rulers  
At Ögló.

Thus sang Glúmr Geirason:

There the Týr of Triumph  
Himself inspired the terror  
Of ships; the gods of breezes  
That favor good men steered them.

Thus sang Eyvindr:

{p. 99}

Göndull and Skögull  
Gauta-Týr sent  
To choose from kings  
Who of Yngvi's kin  
Should go with Odin  
And be in Valhall.

Thus sang Úlfr Uggason:

Swiftly the Far-Famed rideth,  
The Foretelling God, to the fire speeds,  
To the wide pyre of his offspring;  
Through my cheeks praise-songs are pouring.

Thus sang Thjódólfr of Hvin:

The slain lay there sand-strewing,  
Spoil for the Single-Eyed  
Dweller in Frigg's bosom;  
In such deeds we rejoiced.

Hallfredr sang thus:

The doughty ship-possessor  
With sharpened words and soothfast  
Lures our land, the patient,  
Barley-lockèd Wife of Thridi.

Here is an example of this metaphor, that in poesy the earth is called
the Wife of Odin. Here is told what Eyvindr sang:

Hermódr and Bragi,  
Spake Hropta-Týr.

{p. 100}

Go ye to greet the Prince;  
For a king who seemeth  
A champion cometh  
To the hall hither.

Thus sang Kormákr:

The Giver of Lands, who bindeth  
The sail to the top, with gold-lace  
Honors him who pours god's verse-mead;  
Odin wrought charms on Rindr.

Thus sang Steinthórr:

Much have I to laud  
The ancient-made (though little)  
Liquor of the valiant  
Load of Gunnlöd's arm-clasp.

Thus sang Úlfr Uggason:

There I think the Valkyrs follow,  
And ravens, Victorious Odin  
To the blood of holy Baldr.  
With old tales the hall was painted.

Thus sang Egill Skallagrímsson:

No victims for this  
To Víli's brother,  
The High-God, I offer,  
Glad to behold him;

{p. 101}

Yet has Mímir's friend  
On me bestowed  
Amends of evil  
Which I account better.

He has given me the art  
He, the Wolf's Opposer,  
Accustomed to battle,  
Of blemish blameless.

Here he is called High God, and Friend of Mímir, and Adversary of the
Wolf.

Thus sang Refr:

Swift God of Slain, that wieldeth  
The snowy billow's wave-hawks,  
The ships that drive the sea-road,  
To thee we owe the dwarves' drink.

Thus sang Einarr Tinkling-Scale:

'T is mine to pour the liquor  
Of the Host-God's mead-cask freely  
Before the ships' swift Speeder:  
For this I win no scorning.

Thus sang Úlfr Uggason:

His steed the lordly Heimdallr  
Spurs to the pyre gods builded  
For the fallen son of Odin,  
The All-Wise Raven-Ruler.

{p. 102}

This is said in *Eiríksmál*:

What dream is that? quoth Odin,--  
I thought to rise ere day-break  
To make Valhall ready  
For troops of slain;  
I roused the champions,  
Bade them rise swiftly  
Benches to strew,  
To wash beer-flagons;  
The Valkyrs to pour wine,  
As a Prince were coming.

Kormákr sang this:

I pray the precious Ruler  
Of Yngvi's people, o'er me  
To hold his hand, bow-shaking.  
Hroptr bore with him Gungnir.

Thórálfr sang this:

The Mighty One of Hlidskjálf  
Spake his mind unto them  
Where the hosts of fearless  
Hárekr were slaughtered.

Thus sang Eyvindr:

The mead which forth  
From Surtr's sunk dales  
The Strong-through-spells  
Swift-flying bore.

{p. 103}

So sang Bragi:

'Tis seen, on my shield's surface,  
How the Son of the Father of Peoples  
Craved to try his strength full swiftly  
'Gainst the rain-beat Snake earth-circling.

Thus sang Eínarr:

Since less with Bestla's Offspring  
Prevail most lordly princes  
Than thou, my task is singing  
Thy praise in songs of battle.

Thus sang Thorvaldr Blending-Skald:

Now have I much  
In the middle grasped  
Of the son of Borr,  
Of Búri's heir.

III\. "Now you shall hear how the skalds have termed the art of poesy in
these metaphorical phrases which have been recorded before: for example,
by calling it Kvasir's Gore and Ship of the Dwarves, Dwarves' Mead, Mead
of the Æsir, Giants' Father-Ransom, Liquor of Ódrerir and of Bodn and of
Són, and Fullness of these, Liquor of Hnitbjörg, Booty and Find and Gift
of Odin, even as has been sung in these verses which Einarr
Tinkling-Scale wrought:

I pray the high-souled Warder  
Of earth to hear the Ocean  
Of the Cliff of Dwarves, my verses:  
Hear, Earl, the Gore of Kvasir.

{p. 104}

And as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang further:

The Dwarves' Crag's Song-wave rushes  
O'er all the dauntless shield-host  
Of him who speeds the fury  
Of the shield-wall's piercing sword-bane.

Even as Ormr Steinthórsson sang:

The body of the dame  
And my dead be borne  
Into one hall; the Drink  
Of Dvalinn, Franklins, hear.

And as Refr sang:

I reveal the Thought's Drink  
Of the Rock-Folk to Thorsteinn;  
The Billow of the Dwarf-Crag  
Plashes; I bid men hearken.

Even as Egill sang:

The Prince requires my lore,  
And bound his praise to pour,  
Odin's Mead I bore  
To English shore.

And as Glúmr Geirason sang:

Let the Princely Giver hearken:  
I hold the God-King's liquor.

{p. 105}

Let silence, then, be granted,  
While we sing the loss of thanes.

And as Eyvindr sang:

A hearing I crave  
For the High One's Liquor,  
While I utter  
Gillingr's Atonement;  
While his kin  
In the Kettle-Brewing  
Of the Gallows-Lord  
To the gods I trace.

Even as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

The Wave of Odin surges;  
Of Ódrerir's Sea a billow  
'Gainst the tongue's song-glade crashes;  
Aye our King's works are goodly.

And as he sang further:

Now that which Bodn's Billow  
Bodes forth will straight be uttered:  
Let the War-King's host make silence  
In the hall, and hear the Dwarves' Ship.

And as Eilífr Gudrúnarson sang:

Grant shall ye gifts of friendship,  
Since grows of Són the Seedling  
In our tongue's fertile sedge-bank:  
True praise of our High Lord.

{p. 106}

Even as Völu-Steinn sang:

Egill, hear the Heart-streams  
Of Odin beat in cadence  
'Gainst my palate's skerry;  
The God's Spoil to me is given.

Thus sang Ormr Steinthórsson:

No verse of mine men need to fear,  
No mockery I intertwine  
In Odin's Spoil; my skill is sure  
In forging songs of praise.

Thus sang Úlfr Uggason:

I show to host-glad Áleifr  
The Heart-Fjord's Shoal of Odin,--  
My song: him do I summon  
To hear the Gift of Grímnir.

Poesy is called Sea, or Liquid of the Dwarves, because Kvasir's blood
was liquid in Ódrerir before the mead was made, and then it was put into
the kettle; wherefore it is called Odin's Kettle-Liquor, even as Eyvindr
sang and as we have recorded before:

While his kin  
In the Kettle-Brewing  
Of the Gallows-Lord  
To the gods I trace.\[1\]

\[1. See page 105.\]

{p. 107}

Moreover, poesy is called Ship or Ale of the Dwarves: ale is *líð*, and
*lið* is a word for ships; therefore it is held that it is for this
reason that poesy is now called Ship of the Dwarves, even as this verse
tells:

The wit of Gunnlöd's Liquor  
In swelling wind-like fullness,  
And the everlasting Dwarves' Ship  
I own, to send the same road.

IV\. "What figures should be employed to periphrase the name of Thor?
Thus: one should call him Son of Odin and of Jörd, Father of Magni and
Módi and Thrúdr, Husband of Sif, Stepfather of Ullr, Wielder and
Possessor of Mjöllnir and of the Girdle of Strength, and of Bilskirnir;
Defender of Ásgard and of Midgard, Adversary and Slaver of Giants and
Troll-Women, Smiter of Hrungnir, of Geirrödr and of Thrívaldi, Master of
Thjálfi and Röskva, Foe of the Midgard Serpent. Foster-father of Vingnir
and Hlóra. So sang Bragi the Skald:

The line of Odin's Offspring  
Lay not slack on the gunwale,  
When the huge ocean-serpent  
Uncoiled on the sea's bottom.

Thus sang Ölvir Cut-Nose-and-Crop-Ears:

The encírcler of all regions  
And Jörd's Son sought each other.

{p. 108}

Thus sang Eilífr:

Wroth stood Röskva's Brother,  
And Magni's Sire wrought bravely:  
With terror Thor's staunch heart-stone  
Trembled not, nor Thjálfi's.

And thus sang Eysteinn Valdason:

With glowing eyes Thrúdr's Father  
Glared at the sea-road's circler,  
Ere the fishes' watery dwelling  
Flowed in, the boat confounding.

Eysteinn sang further:

Swiftly Sif's Husband bouned him  
To haste forth with the Giants  
For his hardy fishing:  
Well sing we Hrímnir's horn-stream.

Again he sang:

The earth-fish tugged so fiercely  
That Ullr's Kinsman's clenched fists  
Were pulled out past the gunwale;  
The broad planks rent asunder.

Thus sang Bragi:

The strong fiend's Terrifier  
In his right hand swung his hammer,  
When he saw the loathly sea-fish  
That all the lands confineth.

{p. 109}

Thus sang Gamli:

While the Lord of high Bilskirnir,  
Whose heart no falsehood fashioned,  
Swiftly strove to shatter  
The sea-fish with his hammer.

Thus sang Thorbjörn Lady's-Skald:

Bravely Thor fought for Ásgard  
And the followers of Odin.

Thus sang Bragi:

And the vast misshapen circler  
Of the ship's sea-path, fierce-minded,  
Stared from below in anger  
At the Skull-Splitter of Hrungnir.

Again sang Bragi:

Well hast Thou, Hewer-in-Sunder  
Of the nine heads of Thrívaldi,  
Kept thy goats\[1\] . . . .

Thus sang Eilífr:

The Merciless Destroyer  
Of the people of the Giants  
Grasped with ready fore-arms  
At the heavy red-hot iron.

\[1. The remainder of this stanza cannot be made out.\]

{p. 110}

Thus sang Úlfr Uggason:

Faintly the stout-framed thickling  
A fearful peril called it,  
At the great draught wondrous heavy  
Drawn up by the Lord of he-goats.

Thus Úlfr sang further:

The very mighty Slayer  
Of the Mountain-Man brought crashing  
His fist on Hymir's temple:  
That was a hurt full deadly.

Yet again sang Úlfr:

Vimur's ford's Wide-Grappler  
'Gainst the waves smote featly  
The glittering Serpent's head off.  
With old tales the hall was gleaming.

Here he is called Giant of Vimur's Ford. There is a river called Vimur,
which Thor waded when he journeyed to the garth of Geirrödr.

Thus sang Vetrlidi the skald:

Thou didst break the leg of Leikn,  
Didst cause to stoop Starkadr,  
Didst bruise Thrívaldi,  
Didst stand on lifeless Gjálp.

Thus sang Thorbjörn Lady's-Skald:

Thou didst smite the head of Keila,  
Smash Kjallandi altogether,

{p. 111}

Ere thou slewest Lútr and Leidi,  
Didst spill the blood of Búseyra;  
Didst hold back Hengjankjapta,  
Hyrrokkin died before;  
Yet sooner in like fashion  
Svívör from life was taken.

V. "How should one periphrase Baldr? By calling him Son of Odin and
Frigg, Husband of Nanna, Father of Forseti, Possessor of Hringhorni and
Draupnir, Adversary of Hödr, Companion of Hel, God of Tears. Úlfr
Uggason, following the story of Baldr, has composed a long passage in
the *Húsdrápa*; and examples are recorded earlier to the effect that
Baldr is so termed.

VI\. "How should one periphrase Njördr? By calling him God of the Vanir,
or Kinsman of the Vanir, or Wane, Father of Freyr and Freyja, God of
Wealth-Bestowal.

So says Thórdr Sjáreksson:

Gudrun's self by ill  
Her sons did kill;  
The wise God-bride  
At the Wane's side  
Grieved; men tell  
Odin tamed steeds well;  
'T was not the saying  
Hamdir spared sword-playing.

Here it is recorded that Skadi departed from Njördr, as has already been
written.

{p. 112}

VII\. "How should one periphrase Freyr? Thus: by calling him Son of
Njördr, Brother of Freyja, and also God of Vanir, and Kinsman of the
Vanir, and Wane, and God of the Fertile Season, and God of Wealth-Gifts.

Thus sang Egill Skallagrímsson:

For that Grjótbjörn  
In goods and gear  
Freyr and Njördr  
Have fairly blessed.

Freyr is called Adversary of Beli, even as Eyvindr Spoiler of Skalds
sang:

When the Earl's foe  
Wished to inhabit  
The outer bounds  
Of Beli's hater.

He is the possessor of Skídbladnir and of that boar which is called
Gold-Bristle, even as it is told here:

Ívaldi's offspring  
In ancient days  
Went to shape Skídbladnir,  
Foremost of ships,  
Fairly for Freyr,  
Choicely for Njördr's child.

Thus speaks Úlfr Uggason:

The battle-bold Freyr rideth  
First on the golden-bristled

{p. 113}

Barrow-boar to the bale-fire  
Of Baldr, and leads the people.

The boar is also called Fearful-Tusk.

VIII\. "How should one periphrase Heimdallr? By calling him Son of Nine
Mothers, or Watchman of the Gods, as already has been written; or White
God, Foe of Loki, Seeker of Freyja's Necklace. A sword is called
Heimdallr's Head: for it is said that he was pierced by a man's head.
The tale thereof is told in *Heimdalar-galdr*; and ever since a head is
called Heimdallr's Measure; a sword is called Man's Measure. Heimdallr
is the Possessor of Gulltoppr; he is also Frequenter of Vágasker and
Singasteinn, where he contended with Loki for the Necklace Brísinga-men,
he is also called Vindlér. Úlfr Uggason composed a long passage in the
*Húsdrápa* on that legend, and there it is written that they were in the
form of seals. Heimdallr also is son of Odin.

IX\. "How should one periphrase Týr? By calling him the One-handed God,
and Fosterer of the Wolf, God of Battles, Son of Odin.

X. "How should one periphrase Bragi? By calling him Husband of Idunn,
First Maker of Poetry, and the Long-bearded God (after his name, a man
who has a great beard is called Beard-Bragi) and Son of Odin.

XI\. "How should one periphrase Vídarr? He maybe called the Silent God,
Possessor of the Iron Shoe, Foe and Slayer of Fenris-Wolf, Avenger of
the Gods, Divine Dweller in

{p. 114}

the Homesteads of the Fathers, Son of Odin, and Brother of the Æsir.

XII\. "How should Váli be periphrased? Thus: by calling him Son of Odin
and Rindr, Stepson of Frigg, Brother of the Æsir, Baldr's Avenger, Foe
and Slayer of Hödr, Dweller in the Homesteads of the Fathers.

XIII\. "How should one periphrase Hödr? Thus: by calling him the Blind
God, Baldr's Slayer, Thrower of the Mistletoe, Son of Odin, Companion of
Hel, Foe of Váli.

XIV\. How should Ullr be periphrased? By calling him Son of Sif, Stepson
of Thor, God of the Snowshoe, God of the Bow, Hunting-God, God of the
Shield.

XV\. How should Hœnir be periphrased? By calling him Bench-Mate or
Companion or Friend of Odin, the Swift of God, the Long-Footed, and'
King of Clay.\[1\]

XVI\. "How should one periphrase Loki? Thus: call him Son of Fárbauti
and Laufey, or of Nil, Brother of Býleistr and of Helblindi, Father of
the Monster of Ván (that is, Fenris-Wolf), and of the Vast Monster (that
is, the Midgard Serpent), and of Hel, and Nari, and Áli; Kinsman and
Uncle, Evil Companion and Bench-Mate of Odin and the Æsir, Visitor and
Chest-Trapping of Geirrödr, Thief of the Giants, of the Goat, of
Brísinga-men, and of Idunn's Apples, Kinsman of Sleipnir, Husband of
Sigyn, Foe of the Gods, Harmer of Sif's Hair, Forger of Evil, the Sly
God,

\[1. *?Aur-konung*.\]

{p. 115}

Slanderer and Cheat of the Gods, Contriver of Baldr's Death, the Bound
God, Wrangling Foe of Heimdallr and of Skadi. Even as Úlfr Uggason sings
here:

The famed rain-bow's defender,  
Ready in wisdom, striveth  
At Singasteinn with Loki,  
Fárbauti's sin-sly offspring;  
The son of mothers eight and one,  
Mighty in wrath, possesses  
The Stone ere Loki cometh:  
I make known songs of praise.

Here it is written that Heimdallr is the son of nine mothers.

XVII\. "Now an account shall be given of the source of those metaphors
which have but now been recorded, and of which no accounts were rendered
before: even such as Bragi gave to Ægir, telling how Thor had gone into
the east to slay trolls, and Odin rode Sleipnir into Jötunheim and
visited that giant who was named Hrungnir. Hrungnir asked what manner of
man he with the golden helm might be, who rode through air and water;
and said that the stranger had a wondrous good steed. Odin said he would
wager his head there was no horse in Jötunheim that would prove equally
good. Hrungnir answered that it was a good horse, but declared that he
had a much better paced horse which was called Gold-Mane. Hrungnir had
become angry, and vaulted up onto his horse and galloped after him,
thinking to pay him for his boasting. Odin gal loped so furiously that
he was on the top of the next hill first; but Hrungnir was so filled
with the giant's frenzy

{p. 116}

that he took no heed until he had come in beyond the gates of Ásgard.
When he came to the hall-door, the Æsir invited him to drink. He went
within and ordered drink to be brought to him, and then those flagons
were brought in from which Thor was wont to drink; and Hrungnir swilled
from each in turn. But when he had become drunken, then big words were
not wanting: he boasted that he would lift up Valhall and carry it to
Jötunheim, and sink Ásgard and kill all the gods, save that he would
take Freyja and Sif home with him. Freyja alone dared pour for him; and
he vowed that he would drink all the ale of the Æsir. But when his
overbearing insolence became tiresome to the Æsir, they called on the
name of Thor.

"Straightway Thor came into the hall, brandishing his hammer, and he was
very wroth, and asked who had advised that these dogs of giants be
permitted to drink there, or who had granted Hrungnir safe-conduct to be
in Valhall, or why Freyja should pour for him as at a feast of the Æsir.
Then Hrungnir answered, looking at Thor with no friendly eyes, and said
that Odin had invited him to drink, and he was under his safe-conduct.
Thor declared that Hrungnir should repent of that invitation before he
got away. Hrungnir answered that Ása-Thor would have scant renown for
killing him, weaponless as he was: it were a greater trial of his
courage if he dared fight with Hrungnir on the border at Grjótúnagard.
'And it was a great folly,' said he, 'when I left my shield and hone
behind at home; if I had my weapons here, then we should try
single-combat. But as matters stand, I declare thee a coward if thou
wilt slay me, a weaponless man.' Thor was by no means anxious to avoid
the fight when challenged to the field, for no one had ever offered him
single-combat before.

{p. 117}

"Then Hrungnir went his way, and galloped furiously until he came to
Jötunheim. The news of his journey was spread abroad among the giants,
and it became noised abroad that a meeting had been arranged between him
and Thor; the giants deemed that they had much at stake, who should win
the victory, since they looked for ill at Thor's hands if Hrungnir
perished, he being strongest of them all. Then the giants made a man of
clay at Grjótúnagard: he was nine miles high and three broad under the
arm-pits; but they could get no heart big enough to fit him, until they
took one from a mare. Even that was not steadfast within him, when Thor
came. Hrungnir had the heart which is notorious, of hard stone and
spiked with three corners, even as the written character is since
formed, which men call Hrungnir's Heart. His head also was of stone; his
shield too was stone, wide and thick, and he had the shield before him
when he stood at Grjótúnagard and waited for Thor. Moreover he had a
hone for a weapon, and brandished it over his shoulders, and he was not
a pretty sight. At one side of him stood the clay giant, which was
called Mökkurkálfi: he was sore afraid, and it is said that he wet
himself when he saw Thor.

"Thor went to the meeting-place, and Thjálfi with him. Then Thjálfi ran
forward to the spot where Hrungnir stood and said to him: 'Thou standest
unwarily, Giant, having the shield before thee: for Thor has seen thee,
and comes hither down below the earth, and will come at thee from
beneath.' Then Hrungnir thrust the shield under his feet and stood upon
it, wielding the hone with both hands. Then speedily he saw lightnings
and heard great claps of thunder; then he saw Thor in God-like anger,
who came forward furiously and swung the hammer and cast it at Hrungnir

{p. 118}

from afar off. Hrungnir lifted up the hone in both hands and cast it
against him; it struck the hammer in flight, and the hone burst in
sunder: one part fell to the earth, and thence are come all the
flint-rocks; the other burst on Thor's head, so that he fell forward to
the earth. But the hammer Mjöllnir struck Hrungnir in the middle of the
head, and smashed his skull into small crumbs, and he fell forward upon
Thor, so that his foot lay over Thor's neck. Thjálfi struck at
Mökkurkálfi, and he fell with little glory. Thereupon Thjálfi went over
to Thor and would have lifted Hrungnir's foot off him, but could not
find sufficient strength. Straightway all the Æsir came up, when they,
learned that Thor was fallen, and would have lifted the foot from off
him, and could do nothing. Then Magni came up, son of Thor and Járnsaxa:
he was then three nights old; he cast the foot of Hrungnir off Thor, and
spake: 'See how ill it is, father, that I came so late: I had struck
this giant dead with my fist, methinks, if I had met with him.' Thor
arose and welcomed his son, saying that he should surely become great;
'And I will give thee,' he said, the horse Gold-Mane, which Hrungnir
possessed.' Then Odin spake and said that Thor did wrong to give the
good horse to the son of a giantess, and not to his father.

"Thor went home to Thrúdvangar, and the hone remained sticking in his
head. Then came the wise woman who was called Gróa, wife of Aurvandill
the Valiant: she sang her spells over Thor until the hone was loosened.
But when Thor knew that, and thought that there was hope that the hone
might be removed, he desired to reward Gróa for her leech-craft and make
her glad, and told her these things: that he had waded from the north
over Icy Stream and had borne Aurvandill in a basket on his back from
the

{p. 119}

north out of Jötunheim. And he added for a token, that one of
Aurvandill's toes had stuck out of the basket, and became frozen;
wherefore Thor broke it off and cast it up into the heavens, and made
thereof the star called Aurvandill's Toe. Thor said that it would not be
long ere Aurvandill came home: but Gróa was so rejoiced that she forgot
her incantations, and the hone was not loosened, and stands yet in
Thor's head. Therefore it is forbidden to cast a hone across the floor,
for then the hone is stirred in Thor's head. Thjódólfr of Hvin has made
a song after this tale in the *Haustlöng*. \[It says there:

On the high and painted surface  
Of the hollow shield, still further  
One may see how the Giant's Terror  
Sought the home of Grjótún;  
The angry son of Jörd drove  
To the play of steel; below him  
Thundered the moon-way; rage swelled  
In the heart of Meili's Brother.

All the bright gods' high mansions  
Burned before Ullr's kinsman;  
With hail the earth was beaten  
Along his course, when the he-goats  
Drew the god of the smooth wain forward  
To meet the grisly giant:  
The Earth, the Spouse of Odin,  
Straightway reft asunder.

No truce made Baldr's brother  
With the bitter foe of earth-folk.

{p. 120}

Rocks shook, and crags were shivered;  
The shining Upper Heaven  
Burned; I saw the giant  
Of the boat-sailed sea-reef waver  
And give way fast before him,  
Seeing his war-like Slayer.

Swiftly the shining shield-rim  
Shot 'neath the Cliff-Ward's shoe-soles;  
That was the wise gods' mandate,  
The War-Valkyrs willed it.  
The champion of the Waste-Land  
Not long thereafter waited  
For the speedy blow delivered  
By the Friend of the snout-troll's crusher.

He who of breath despoileth  
Beli's baleful hirelings  
Felled on the shield rim-circled  
The fiend of the roaring mountain;  
The monster of the glen-field  
Before the mighty hammer  
Sank, when the Hill-Danes' Breaker  
Struck down the hideous caitiff.

Then the hone hard-broken  
Hurled by the Ogress-lover  
Whirred into the brain-ridge  
Of Earth's Son, that the whetter  
Of steels, sticking unloosened  
In the skull of Odin's offspring,

{p. 121}

Stood there all besprinkled  
With Einridi's blood.

Until the wise ale-goddess,  
With wondrous lays, enchanted  
The vaunted woe, rust-ruddy,  
From the Wain-God's sloping temples;  
Painted on its circuit  
I see them clearly pictured:  
The fair-bossed shield, with stories  
Figured, I had from Thórlelfr."\]\[1\]

XVIII\. Then said, Ægir: "Methinks Hrungnir was of great might. Did Thor
accomplish yet more valorous deeds when he had to do with the trolls?"
And Bragi answered: "It is worthy to be told at length, how Thor went to
Geirrödr's dwelling. At that time he had not the hammer Mjöllnir with
him, nor his Girdle of Might, nor the iron gauntlets: and that was the
fault of Loki, who went with him. For once, flying in his sport with
Frigg's hawk-plumage, it had happened to Loki to fly for curiosity's
sake into Geirrödr's court. There he saw a great hall, and alighted and
looked in through the window; and Geirrödr looked up and saw him, and
commanded that the bird be taken and brought to him, But he who was sent
could scarce get to the top of the wall, so high was it; and it seemed
pleasant to Loki to see the man striving with toil and pains to reach
him, and he thought it was not yet time to fly away until the other had
accomplished the perilous climb. When the man pressed hard after him,
then he stretched his wings for flight, and thrust out vehemently, but
now his feet were stuck fast.

\[1. Passages enclosed within brackets are considered by Jónsson to be
spurious.\]

{p. 122}

So Loki was taken and brought before Geirrödr the giant; but when
Geirrödr saw his eyes, he suspected that this might be a man, and bade
him answer; but Loki was silent. Then Geirrödr shut Loki into a chest
and starved him there three months. And now when Geirrödr took him out
and commanded him to speak, Loki told who he was; and by way of ransom
for his life he swore to Geirrödr with oaths that he would get Thor to
come into Geirrödr's dwelling in such a fashion that he should have
neither hammer nor Girdle of Might with him.

"Thor came to spend the night with that giantess who was called Grídr,
mother of Vídarr the Silent. She told Thor the truth concerning
Geirrödr, that he was a crafty giant and ill to deal with; and she lent
him the Girdle of Might and iron gloves which she possessed, and her
staff also, which was called Grídr's Rod. Then Thor proceeded to the
river named Vimur, greatest of all rivers. There he girded himself with
the Girdle of Might and braced firmly downstream with Grídr's Rod, and
Loki held on behind by the Girdle of Might. When Thor came to
mid-current, the river waxed so greatly that it broke high upon his
shoulders. Then Thor sang this:

Wax thou not now, Vimur,  
For I fain would wade thee  
Into the Giants' garth:  
Know thou, if thou waxest,  
Then waxeth God-strength in me  
As high up as the heaven.

"Then Thor saw Gjálp, daughter of Geirrödr, standing in certain ravines,
one leg in each, spanning the river,

{p. 123}

and she was causing the spate. Then Thor snatched up a great stone out
of the river and cast it at her, saying these words: 'At its source
should a river be stemmed.' Nor did he miss that at which he threw. In
that moment he came to the shore and took hold of a rowan-clump, and so
climbed out of the river; whence comes the saying that rowan is Thor's
deliverance.

"Now when Thor came before Geirrödr, the companions were shown first
into the goat-fold\[1\] for their entertainment, and there was one chair
there for a seat, and Thor sat there. Then he became aware that the
chair moved under him up toward the roof: he thrust Grídr's Rod up
against the rafters and pushed back hard against the chair. Then there
was a great crash, and screaming followed. Under the chair had been
Geirrödr's daughters, Gjálp and Greip; and he had broken both their
backs. Then Geirrödr had Thor called into the hall to play games. There
were great fires the whole length of the hall. When Thor came up over
against Geirrödr, then Geirrödr took up a glowing bar of iron with the
tongs and cast it at Thor. Thor caught it with his iron gloves and
raised the bar in the air, but Geirrödr leapt behind an iron pillar to
save himself. Thor lifted up the bar and threw it, and it passed through
the pillar and through Geirrödr and through the wall, and so on out,
even into the earth. Eilífr Gudrúnarson has wrought verses on this
story, in *Thórsdrápa*:

\[The winding sea-snake's father  
Did wile from home the slayer

\[1. So Cod. Reg. and Cod. Worm.; Cod. Upsal. and Cod. Hypn. read *gesta
hús* = guest's house. Gering, Simrock, and Anderson prefer the latter
reading. I have followed Jónsson in accepting *geita hús*.\]

{p. 124}

Of the life of the gods' grim foemen;  
--(Ever was Loptr a liar)--  
The never faithful Searcher  
Of the heart of the fearless Thunderer  
Declared green ways were lying  
To the walled stead of Geirrödr.

No long space Thor let Loki  
Lure him to the going:  
They yearned to overmaster  
Thorn's offspring, when the Seeker  
Of Idi's garth, than giants  
Greater in might, made ready  
In ancient days, for faring  
To the Giants' Seat, from Odin's.

Further in the faring  
Forward went warlike Thjálfi  
With the divine Host-Cheerer  
Than the deceiving lover  
Of her of enchanted singing:  
--(I chant the Ale of Odin)--  
The hill dame's Mocker measured  
The moor with hollow foot-soles.

And the war-wonted journeyed  
Till the hill-women's Waster  
Came to Gangr's blood, the Vimur;  
Then Loki's bale-repeller,  
Eager in anger, lavish  
Of valor, longed to struggle

{p. 125}

Against the maid, kinswoman  
Of the sedge-cowled giant.

And the honor-lessener  
Of the Lady of the Sea-Crag  
Won foot-hold in the surging  
Of the hail-rolled leaping hill-spate;  
The rock-knave's swift Pursuer  
Passed the broad stream of his staff's road,  
Where the foam-flecked mighty rivers  
Frothed with raging venom.

There they set the staves before them  
In the streaming grove of dogfish;  
The wind-wood's slippery pebbles,  
Smitten to speech, slept not;  
The clashing rod did rattle  
'Gainst the worn rocks, and the rapid  
Of the fells howled, storm-smitten,  
On the river's stony anvil.

The Weaver of the Girdle  
Beheld the washing slope-stream  
Fall on his hard-grown shoulders:  
No help he found to save him;  
The Minisher of hill-folk  
Caused Might to grow within him  
Even to the roof of heaven,  
Till the rushing flood should ebb.

The fair warriors of the Æsir,  
In battle wise, fast waded,

{p. 125}

And the surging pool, sward-sweeping,  
Streamed: the earth-drift's billow,  
Blown by the mighty tempest,  
Tugged with monstrous fury  
At the terrible oppressor  
Of the earth-born tribe of cave-folk.

Till Thjálfi came uplifted  
On his lord Thor's wide shield-strap:  
That was a mighty thew-test  
For the Prop of Heaven; the maidens  
Of the harmful giant stiffly  
Held the stream stubborn against them;  
The Giantess-Destroyer  
With Grídr's staff fared sternly.

Nor did their hearts of rancor  
Droop in the men unblemished,  
Nor courage 'gainst the headlong  
Fall of the current fail them:  
A fiercer-daring spirit  
Flamed in the dauntless God's breast,--  
With terror Thor's staunch heart-stone  
Trembled not, nor Thjálfi's.

And afterward the haters  
Of the host of sword-companions,  
The shatterers of bucklers,  
Dinned on the shield of giants,  
Ere the destroying peoples  
Of the shingle-drift of monsters

{p. 127}

Wrought the helm-play of Hedinn  
'Gainst the rock-dwelling marksmen.

The hostile folk of sea-heights  
Fled before the Oppressor  
Of headland tribes; the dalesmen  
Of the hill-tops, imperilled,  
Fled, when Odin's kindred  
Stood, enduring staunchly;  
The Danes of the flood-reef's border  
Bowed down to the Flame-Shaker.

Where the chiefs, with thoughts of valor  
Imbued, marched into Thorn's house,  
A mighty crash resounded  
Of the cave's ring-wall; the slayer  
Of the mountain-reindeer-people  
On the giant-maiden's wide hood  
Was brought in bitter peril:  
There was baleful peace-talk.

And they pressed the high head, bearing  
The piercing brow-moon's eye-flame  
Against the hill-hall's rafters;  
On the high roof-tree broken  
He crushed those raging women:  
The swinging Storm-car's Guider  
Burst the stout, ancient back-ridge  
And breast-bones of both women.

Earth's Son became familiar  
With knowledge strange; the cave-men

{p. 128}

Of the land of stone o'ercame not,  
Nor long with ale were merry:  
The frightful elm-string's plucker,  
The friend of Sudri, hurtled  
The hot bar, in the forge fused,  
Into the hand of Odin's Gladdener.

So that Gunnr's Swift-Speeder  
Seized (the Friend of Freyja),  
With quick hand-gulps, the molten  
High-raised draught of metal,  
When the fire-brand, glowing,  
Flew with maddened fury  
From the giant's gripping fingers  
To the grim Sire of Thrúdr.

The hall of the doughty trembled  
When he dashed the massy forehead  
Of the hill-wight 'gainst the bottom  
Of the house-wall's ancient column;  
Ullr's glorious step-sire  
With the glowing bar of mischief  
Struck with his whole strength downward  
At the hill-knave's mid-girdle.

The God with gory hammer  
Crushed utterly Glaumr's lineage;  
The Hunter of the Kindred  
Of the hearth-dame was victorious;  
The Plucker of the Bow-String  
Lacked not his people's valor,--

{p. 129}

The Chariot-God, who swiftly  
Wrought grief to the Giant's bench-thanes.

He to whom hosts make offering  
Hewed down the dolt-like dwellers  
Of the cloud-abyss of Elf-Home,  
Crushing them with the fragment  
Of Grídr's Rod: the litter  
Of hawks, the race of Listi  
Could not harm the help-strong  
Queller of Ella's Stone-Folk.\]

XIX." How should one periphrase Frigg? Call her Daughter of Fjörgynn,
Wife of Odin, Mother of Baldr, Co-Wife of Jörd and Rindr and Gunnlöd and
Grídr, Mother-in-law of Nanna, Lady of the Æsir and Ásynjur, Mistress of
Fulla and of the Hawk-Plumage and of Fensalir.

XX\. "How should one periphrase Freyja? Thus: by calling her Daughter of
Njördr, Sister of Freyr, Wife of Ódr, Mother of Hnoss, Possessor of the
Slain, of Sessrúmnir, of the Gib-Cats, and of Brísinga-men; Goddess of
the Vanir, Lady of the Vanir, Goddess Beautiful in Tears, Goddess of
Love. All the goddesses may be periphrased thus: by calling them by the
name of another, and naming them in terms of their possessions or their
works or their kindred.

\[XXI. "How should Sif be periphrased? By calling her Wife of Thor,
Mother of Ullr, Fair-Haired Goddess, Co-Wife of Járnsaxa, Mother of
Thrúdr.

XXII\. "How should Idunn be periphrased? Thus: by calling

{p. 130}

her Wife of Bragi, and Keeper of the Apples; and the apples should be
called Age-Elixir of the Æsir. Idunn is also called Spoil of the Giant
Thjazi, according to the tale that has been told before, how he took her
away from the Æsir. Thjódólfr of Hvin composed verses after that tale in
the *Haustlöng*:

How shall I make voice-payment  
Meetly for the shield-bridge  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .  
Of the war-wall Thórleifr gave me?  
I survey the truceless faring  
Of the three gods strife-foremost,  
And Thjatsi's, on the shining  
Cheek of the shield of battle.

The Spoiler of the Lady  
Swiftly flew with tumult  
To meet the high god-rulers  
Long hence in eagle-plumage;  
The erne in old days lighted  
Where the Æsir meat were bearing  
To the fire-pit; the Giant  
Of the rocks was called no faint-heart.

The skilful god-deceiver  
To the gods proved a stern sharer  
Of bones: the high Instructor  
Of Æsir, helmet-hooded,  
Saw some power checked the seething;  
The sea-mew, very crafty,

{p. 131}

Spake from the ancient tree-trunk;  
Loki was ill-willed toward him.

The wolfish monster ordered  
Meili's Sire to deal him  
Food from the holy trencher:  
The friend of Him of Ravens  
To blow the fire was chosen;  
The Giant-King, flesh-greedy,  
Sank down, where the guileless  
Craft-sparing gods were gathered.

The comely Lord of All Things  
Commanded Loki swiftly  
To part the bull's-meat, slaughtered  
By Skadi's ringing bow-string,  
Among the folk, but straightway  
The cunning food-defiler  
Of the Æsir filched-the quarters,  
All four, from the broad table.

And the hungry Sire of Giants  
Savagely ate the yoke-beast  
From the oak-tree's sheltering branches,--  
That was in ancient ages,--  
Ere the wise-minded Loki,  
Warder of war-spoil, smote him,  
Boldest of foes of Earth-Folk,  
With a pole betwixt the shoulders.

The Arm-Burden then of Sigyn,  
Whom all the gods in bonds see,

{p. 132}

Firmly forthwith was fastened  
To the Fosterer of Skadi;  
To Jötunheim's Strong Dweller  
The pole stuck, and the fingers  
Of Loki too, companion  
Of Hœnir, clung to the pole's end.

The Bird of Blood flew upward  
(Blithesome in his quarry)  
A long way off with Loki,  
The lither God, that almost  
Wolf's Sire was rent asunder;  
Thor's friend must sue for mercy,  
Such peace as he might purchase  
To pray: nigh slain was Loptr.

Then Hymir's Kinsman ordered  
The crafty god, pain-maddened,  
To wile to him the Maiden  
Who warded the Æsir's age-cure;  
Ere long the necklace-robber,  
Brísinga's thief, lured slyly  
The Dame of Brunnakr's brooklet  
Into the Base One's dwelling.

At that the steep slope-dwellers  
No sorrow felt; then Idunn  
Was from the south, by giants  
New-stolen, come among them.  
All Ingvi-Freyr's high kindred,  
Hoary and old, to council

{p. 133}

Hasted; grewsome of fashion  
And ugly all the gods were.  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .\[1\]  
This heard I, that the Staunch Friend  
Of Hœnir--oft thereafter  
With wiles he tricked the Æsir--  
Flew, in hawk-wings hidden;  
And the vile Sire of Giants,  
Vigorous Wing-Plume-Wielder,  
Hurtled on eagle-pinion  
After the hawk-shaped Loki.

Swiftly the gods have kindled  
A fire; and the sovereign rulers  
Sustained the flame with shavings:  
Scorched was the flying giant,--  
He plunged down in mid-soaring:  
'Tis pictured on the giant's  
Sole-bridge, the shield which, painted  
With stories, Thórleifr gave me.\]

"This is the correct manner of periphrasing the Æsir: To call each of
them by the name of another, and to designate him in terms of his works
or his possessions or his kindred.

XXIII\. "How should the heaven be periphrased? Thus: call it Skull of
Ymir, and hence, Giant's Skull; Task or Burden of the Dwarves, or Helm
of Vestri and Austri, Sudri, or Nordri; Land of the Sun, of the Moon,
and of the

\[1. "Brjála ður texti"--Jónsson, *Edda* (Reykjavik, 1907), p. 384. The
condition of the text makes translation impossible.\]

{p. 134}

Stars of Heaven, of the Wains and the Winds; Helm, or House, of the Air
and the Earth and the Sun. So sang Arnórr Earls'-Skald:

So large of gifts ne'er mounted  
Young Lord of Shields on ship-deck  
'Neath the ancient Skull of Ymir:  
Splendid this Prince's largess.

And as he sang again:

Bright grows the sun at dusking,  
The earth sinks into the dark sea,  
The Toil of Austri bursteth;  
All the ocean on the fells breaks.

Thus sang Bödvarr the Halt:

For never 'neath the Sun's Plain  
Shall come a nobler Land-Ward,  
Keener in battle-onset,  
Nor a brother of Ingi better.

And as Thjódólfr of Hvin sang:

Jörd's Son drove to the steel-play  
(High swelled the godlike anger  
In the mind of Meili's Brother),  
And the Moon-Way 'neath him quivered.

Even as sang Ormr Barrey's-Skald:

Lady of Draupnir's gore-streak,  
However great I know him,

{p. 135}

The wielder (by right he ruleth)  
Of the Wain's Road sees me gladly.

Even as the skald Bragi sang:

He who threw the dead eyes  
Of Thjazi, Skadi's father,  
Into the Winds' Wide Basin  
O'er the abodes of men-folk many.

And as Markús sang:

'Tis long since the dear-loved Warder  
Of sea-men was born on the wave-girt earth-bottom  
Of the Storm-Container; each man praises  
The sublime age of the Ring-Dispenser.

Even as Steinn Herdísarson sang:

I sing the holy Ruler  
Of the high World-Tent rather  
Than men, for very precious  
Is He: His praises tell I.

And as Arnórr Earls'-Skald sang:

Help, dear King of Heaven,  
The Day's Plain, help my Hermundr.

And as Arnórr sang further:

Soothfast King of the Sun-Tents,  
Help stout-hearted Rögnvaldr.

{p. 136}

And as Hallvardr sang:

Knútr wards the land, as the Ruler  
Of All wards the radiant Fell-Hall.

As Arnórr sang:

Michael, wise of understanding,  
Weighs what seems done ill, and good things:  
Then the Monarch of the Sun's Helm  
At the Doom-Seat parts all mortals.

XXIV\. "How should one periphrase the earth? Thus: by calling her Flesh
of Ymir, and Mother of Thor, Daughter of Ónarr, Odin's Bride, Co-Wife of
Frigg and Rindr and Gunnlöd, Mother-in-law of Sif, Floor and Bottom of
the Storm-Hall, Sea of Beasts, Daughter of Night, Sister of Audr and of
Day. Even as Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler sang:

Now the beaming gold is hidden  
In the body of the Mother  
Of the Giants' Foe; the counsels  
Of a kindred strong are mighty.

As sang Hallfredr Troublous-Skald:

In council 't was determined  
That the King's friend, wise in counsel,  
Should wed the Land, sole Daughter  
Of Ónarr, greenly wooded.

And he said further:

{p. 137}

The Raven-Abode's brave Ruler  
Got the broad-faced Bride of Odin,  
The Land, with kingly counsels  
Of weapons, lured unto him.

Even as Thjódólfr-sang:

The Ruler, glad in Warriors,  
In the rowed hull doth fasten  
The ships of men to the strand's end,  
At the head of the sea keel-ridden.

As Hallfredr sang:

Full loath to let the Land slip  
I hold the lordly Spear-Prince  
Audr's sister is subjected  
To the splendid Treasure-Spender.

Thus sang Thjódólfr:

Far off the dart-slow sluggard  
Stood, when the Sword-Inciter  
In ancient days took to him  
The unripe Co-Wife of Rindr.

XXV\. "How should one periphrase the sea? Thus: by calling it Ymir's
Blood; Visitor of the Gods; Husband of Rán; Father of Ægir's Daughters,
of them who are called Himinglæva, Dúfa, Blódughadda, Hefring, Udr,
Hrönn, Bylgja, Bára, Kolga; Land of Rán and of Ægir's Daughters, of
Ships and of ships' names, of the Keel, of Beaks, of Planks and Seams,
of Fishes, of Ice; Way and Road of

{p. 138}

Sea-Kings; likewise Encircler of Islands; House of Sands and of Kelp and
of Reefs; Land of Fishing-gear, of Sea-Fowls, and of Fair Wind. Even as
Ormr Barrey's-Skald sang:

On the gravelly beach of good ships  
Grates the Blood of Ymir.

As Refr sang:

The mild deer of the masthead beareth  
O'er the murky water from the westward  
Her wave-pressed bows; the land I look for  
Before the beak; the Whale-Home shallows.

Even as Steinn sang:

When the fallow fell-wall's Whirlwinds  
Wove o'er the waves full fiercely,  
And Ægir's storm-glad daughters  
Tore, of grim frost begotten.

And as Refr sang:

Gymir's wet-cold Spae-Wife  
Wiles the Bear of Twisted Cables  
Oft into Ægir's wide jaws,  
Where the angry billow breaketh.

It is said here that Ægir and Gymir are both the same. And he sang
further:

And the Sea-Peak's Sleipnir slitteth  
The stormy breast rain-driven,

{p. 139}

The wave, with red stain running  
Out of white Rán's mouth.

As Einarr Skúlason sang:

The stern snow-wind has thrust out  
With strength, the ship from landward:  
The Swan-Land's steed sees Iceland  
Into the surf receding.

And as he sang further:

Many a stiff rowlock straineth,  
And the noisy Strand of Fish-Gear,  
The Sea, the lands o'ercometh:  
Men's hands oft span the stays.

And he sang yet further:

The gray Isle-Fetter urges  
Heiti's raven-ship onward;  
Gold beaks the fleet ships carry:  
Rich that faring to the Chieftain.

And he sang again:

The Isle-Rim autumn chilly  
Impels the dock's cold snowshoe.

And thus also:

The cool lands' Surging-Girdle  
Before the beaks springs asunder.

{p. 140}

As Snæbjorn sang:

They say nine brides of skerries  
Swiftly move the Sea-Churn  
Of Grótti's Island-Flour-Bin  
Beyond the Earth's last outskirt,--  
They who long the corny ale ground  
Of Amlódí; the Giver  
Of Rings now cuts with ship's beak  
The Abiding-Place of boat-sides.

Here the sea is called Amlódi's Churn.

As Einarr Skúlason sang:

The sturdy drive-nails weaken  
In the swift swirl, where paleth  
Rakni's Heaving Plain: wind  
Puffs the reefs against the stays.

XXVI\. "How should one periphrase the sun? By calling her Daughter of
Mundilfari, Sister of the Moon, Wife of Glenr, Fire of Heaven and of the
Air. Even as Skúli Thorsteinsson sang:

Glenr's god-blithe Bed-Mate wadeth  
Into the Goddess's mansion  
With rays; then the good light cometh  
Of gray-sarked Máni downward.

Thus sang Einarr Skúlason:

Whereso the lofty flickering  
Flame of the World's Hall swimmeth

{p. 141}

O'er our loved friend, who hateth  
And lavisheth the sea-gold.

XXVII\. "How should the wind be periphrased? Thus: call it Son of
Fornjótr, Brother of the Sea and of Fire, Scathe or Ruin or Hound or
Wolf of the Wood or of the Sail or of the Rigging.

Thus spake Sveinn in the *Nordrsetu-drápa*:

First began to fly  
Fornjótr's sons ill-shapen.

XXVIII\. "How should one periphrase fire? Thus: call it Brother of the
Wind and the Sea, Ruin and Destruction of Wood and of Houses, Hálfr's
Bane, Sun of Houses.

XXIX\. "How should winter be periphrased? Thus: call it Son of
Vindsvalr, Destruction of Serpents, Tempest Season. Thus sang Ormr
Steinthórsson:

To the blind man I proffer  
This blessing: Vindsvalr's Son.

Thus sang Ásgrímr:

The warlike Spoil-Bestower,  
Lavish of Wealth, that winter--  
Snake's-Woe--in Thrándheim tarried;  
The folk knew thy true actions.

XXX\. "How should one periphrase summer? Thus: call

{p. 142}

it Son of Svásudr and Comfort of Serpents, and Growth of Men. Even as
Egill Skallagrímsson sang:

We shall wave our swords, O Dyer  
Of Wolf's Teeth, make them glitter:  
A deed we have for wreaking  
In the Comfort of Dale-Serpents.

XXXI\. "How should man be periphrased? By his works, by that which he
gives or receives or does; he may also be periphrased in terms of his
property, those things which he possesses, and, if he be liberal, of his
liberality; likewise in terms of the families from which he descended,
as well as of those which have sprung from him. How is one to periphrase
him in terms of these things? Thus, by calling him accomplisher or
performer of his goings or his conduct, of his battles or sea-voyages or
huntings or weapons or ships. And because he is a tester of weapons and
a winner of battles,--the words for 'winner' and 'wood' being the same,
as are also those for tester' and 'rowan,'--therefore, from these
phrases, skalds have called man Ash or Maple, Grove, or other masculine
tree-names, and periphrased him in such expressions in terms of battles
or ships or possessions. It is also correct to periphrase man with all
the names of the Æsir; also with giant-terms, and this last is for the
most part for mocking or libellous purposes. Periphrasis with the names
of elves is held to be favorable.

"Woman should be periphrased with reference to all female garments, gold
and jewels, ale or wine or any other drink, or to that which she
dispenses or gives; likewise with reference to ale-vessels, and to all
those things which it becomes her to perform or to give. It is correct
to periphrase

{p. 143}

her thus: by calling her giver or user of that of which she partakes.
But the words for 'giver' and 'user' are also names of trees; therefore
woman is called in metaphorical speech by all feminine tree-names. Woman
is periphrased with reference to jewels or agates for this reason: in
heathen times what was called a 'stone-necklace,' which they wore about
the neck, was a part of a woman's apparel; now it is used figuratively
in such a way as to periphrase woman with stones and all names of
stones. Woman is also metaphorically called by the names of the Ásynjur
or the Valkyrs or Norris or women of supernatural kind. It is also
correct to periphrase woman in terms of all her conduct or property or
family.

XXXII\. "How should gold be periphrased? Thus: by calling it Ægir's
Fire, and Needles of Glasir, Hair of Sif, Snood of Fulla, Freyja's
Tears, Talk and Voice and Word of Giants, Draupnir's Drop and Rain or
Shower of Draupnir, or of Freyja's Eyes, Otter's Ransom, Forced Payment
of the Æsir, Seed of Fýris-Plain, Cairn-Roof of Hölgi, Fire of all
Waters and of the Hand, Stone and Reef or Gleam of the Hand.

XXXIII\. Wherefore is gold called Ægir's Fire? This tale is to the same
purport as we have told before: Ægir went to Ásgard to a feast, but when
he was ready to return home, he invited Odin and all the Æsir to visit
him in three months' time. First came Odin and Njördr, Freyr, Týr,
Bragi, Vídarr, Loki; likewise the Ásynjur: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Skadi,
Idunn, Sif. Thor was not there, having gone into the eastern lands to
slay trolls. When the gods had sat down in their places, straightway
Ægir had bright gold

{p. 144}

brought in onto the floor of the hall, and the gold gave forth light and
illumined the hall like fire: and it was used there for lights at his
banquet, even as in Valhall swords were used in place of fire. Then Loki
bandied sharp words with all the gods, and slew one of Ægir's thralls,
him who was called Five-Finger; another of his thralls was named
Fire-Kindler. Rán is the name of Ægir's wife, and their daughters are
nine, even as we have written before. At this feast all things were
self-served, both food and ale, and all implements needful to the feast.
Then the Æsir became aware that Rán had that net wherein she was wont to
catch all men who go upon the sea. Now this tale is to show whence it
comes that gold is called Fire or Light or Brightness of Ægir, of Rán,
or of Ægir's daughters; and now such use is made of these metaphors that
gold is called Fire of the Sea, and of all names of the sea, even as
Ægir or Rán had names associated with the sea. Therefore gold is now
called Fire of Waters or of Rivers, and of all river names.

"But these names have fared just as other figures also have done: the
later skalds have composed after the examples of the old skalds, even
those examples which stood in their poems, but were later expanded into
such forms as seemed to later poets to be like what was written before:
as a lake is to the sea, or the river to the lake, or the brook to the
river. Therefore all these are called new figures, when terms are
expanded to greater length than what was recorded before; and all this
seems well and good, so fair as it concurs with verisimilitude and
nature. As Bragi the Skald sang:

I was given by the Battler  
The fire of the Brook of Sea-Fish:

{p. 145}

He gave it me, with mercy,  
For the Drink of the Mountain-Giant.

XXXIV\. "Why is gold called the Needles, or Leaves; of Glasir? In
Ásgard, before the doors of Valhall, there stands a grove which is
called Glasir, and its leafage is all red gold, even as is sung here:

Glasir stands  
With golden leafage  
Before the High God's halls.

Far and wide, this tree is the fairest known among gods and men.

XXXV\. "Why is gold called Sif's Hair? Loki Laufeyarson, for mischief's
sake, cut off all Sif's hair. But when Thor learned of this, he seized
Loki, and would have broken every bone in him, had he not sworn to get
the Black Elves to make Sif hair of gold, such that it would grow like
other hair. After that, Loki went to those dwarves who are called
Ívaldi's Sons; and they made the hair, and Skídbladnir also, and the
spear which became Odin's possession, and was called Gungnir. Then Loki
wagered his head with the dwarf called Brokkr that Brokkr's brother
Sindri could not make three other precious things equal in virtue to
these. Now when they came to the smithy, Sindri laid a pigskin in the
hearth and bade Brokkr blow, and did not cease work until he took out of
the hearth that which he had laid therein. But when he went out of the
smithy, while the other dwarf was blowing, straightway a fly settled
upon his hand and stung: yet he blew on

{p. 146}

as before, until the smith took the work out of the hearth; and it was a
boar, with mane and bristles of gold. Next, he laid gold in the hearth
and bade Brokkr blow and cease not from his blast until he should
return. He went out; but again the fly came and settled on Brokkr's
neck, and bit now half again as hard as before; yet he blew even until
the smith took from the hearth that gold ring which is called Draupnir.
Then Sindri laid iron in the hearth and bade him blow, saying that it
would be spoiled if the blast failed. Straightway the fly settled
between Brokkr's eyes and stung his eyelid, but when the blood fell into
his eyes so that he could not see, then he clutched at it with his hand
as swiftly as he could,--while the bellows grew flat,--and he swept the
fly from him. Then the smith came thither and said that it had come near
to spoiling all that was in the hearth. Then he took from the forge a
hammer, put all the precious works into the hands of Brokkr his brother,
and bade him go with them to Ásgard and claim the wager.

"Now when he and Loki brought forward the precious gifts, the Æsir sat
down in the seats of judgment; and that verdict was to prevail which
Odin, Thor, and Freyr should render. Then Loki gave Odin the spear
Gungnir, and to Thor the hair which Sif was to have, and Skídbladnir to
Freyr, and told the virtues of all these things: that the spear would
never stop in its thrust; the hair would grow to the flesh as soon as it
came upon Sif's head; and Skídbladnir would have a favoring breeze as
soon as the sail was raised, in whatsoever direction it might go, but
could be folded together like a napkin and be kept in Freyr's pouch if
he so desired. Then Brokkr brought forward his gifts: he gave to Odin
the ring, saying that eight

{p. 147}

rings of the same weight would drop from it every ninth night; to Freyr
he gave the boar, saying that it could run through air and water better
than any horse, and it could never become so dark with night or gloom of
the Murky Regions that there should not be sufficient light where be
went, such was the glow from its mane and bristles. Then he gave the
hammer to Thor, and said that Thor might smite as hard as he desired,
whatsoever might be before him, and the hammer would not fail; and if he
threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not
to return to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark,
it was so small; but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the
fore-haft was somewhat short.

"This was their decision: that the hammer was best of all the precious
works, and in it there was the greatest defence against the Rime-Giants;
and they gave sentence, that the dwarf should have his wager. Then Loki
offered to redeem his head, but the dwarf said that there was no chance
of this. 'Take me, then,' quoth Loki; but when Brokkr would have laid
hands on him, he was a long way off. Loki had with him those shoes with
which he ran through air and over water. Then the dwarf prayed Thor to
catch him, and Thor did so. Then the dwarf would have hewn off his head;
but Loki said that he might have the head, but not the neck. So the
dwarf took a thong and a knife, and would have bored a hole in Loki's
lips and stitched his mouth together, but the knife did not cut. Then
Brokkr said that it would be better if his brother's awl were there: and
even as he named it, the awl was there, and pierced the lips. He
stitched the Ups together, and Loki ripped the thong out of the edges.
That thong, with which Loki's mouth was sewn together, is called
Vartari.

{p. 148}

XXXVI\. "One may hear how gold is metaphorically called Fulla's Snood,
in this verse which Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler wrought:

Fulla's shining Fillet,  
The forehead's sun at rising,  
Shone on the swelling shield-hill  
For skalds all Hakon's life-days.

XXXVII\. "Gold is called Freyja's Tears, as was said before. So sang
Skúli Thorsteinsson:

Many a fearless swordsman  
Received the Tears of Freyja  
The more the morn when foemen  
We murdered; we were present.

And as Einarr Skúlason sang:

Where, mounted 'twixt the carvings,  
The Tear of Mardöll lieth,  
We bear the axe shield-splitting,  
Swollen with Serpent's lair-gold.

And here Einarr has further periphrased Freyja so as to call her Mother
of Hnoss, or Wife of Ódr, as standeth below:

The shield, tempest's strong roof-ice,  
With tear-gold is unminished,  
Eye-rain of Ódr's Bed-Mate:  
His age the King so useth.

And again thus:

{p. 149}

Hörn's Child, the glorious adornment,  
I own, gold-wound--a jewel  
Most fair--to the shield's rim  
Fast is the golden Sea-Flame:  
On the gem, Freyr's Niece, the tear-drift  
Of the fore-head of her Mother  
She bears; the Raven-Feeder  
Gave me Fródi's seed-gold's fostering.

It is also recorded here that one may periphrase Freyja by calling her
Sister of Freyr.

And thus also:

A defence of songs full goodly  
He freely gave me, neighbor  
Of sea-scales: I praise gladly  
Njördr's Daughter's golden gem-child.

Here she is called Daughter of Njördr.

And again thus:

The awesome Stately Urger  
Of Odin, he who raises  
The struggle stern, gave to me  
The courage-stalwart daughter  
Of the Vana-Bride, my fair axe;  
The valorous sword-mote's Ruler  
Led Gefn's girl to the Skald's bed,  
Set with the sea-flame's gold-work.

Here she is called Gefn and Bride of the Vanir.--It is proper to join
'tears' with all the names of Freyja, and

{p. 150}

to call gold by such terms; and in divers ways these periphrases have
been varied, so that gold is called Hail, or Rain, or Snow-Storm, or
Drops, or Showers, or Water falls, of Freyja's Eyes, or Cheeks, or
Brows, or Eyelids.

XXXVIII\. "In this place one may hear that gold is called Word, or
Voice, of Giants, as we have said before; thus sang Bragi the Skald:

Then had I the third friend  
Fairly praised: the poorest  
In the Voice of the Botched-Knob's Áli,  
But best of all to me.

He called a rock Botched Knob, and a giant Áli of Rock, and gold Voice
of the Giant.

XXXIX\. "For what reason is gold called Otter's Wergild? It is related
that when certain of the Æsir, Odin and Loki and Hœnir, went forth to
explore the earth, they came to a certain river, and proceeded along the
river to a waterfall. And beside the fall was an otter, which had taken
a salmon from the fall and was eating, blinking his eyes the while. Then
Loki took up a stone and cast it at the otter, and struck its head. And
Loki boasted in his catch, that he had got otter and salmon with one
blow. Then they took up the salmon and the otter and bore them along
with them, and coming to the buildings of a certain farm, they went in.
Now the husbandman who dwelt there was named Hreidmarr: he was a man of
much substance, and very skilled in black magic. The Æsir asked him for
a night's lodging, saying that they had sufficient food with them, and
showed him

{p. 151}

their catch. But when Hreidmarr saw the otter, straight way he called to
him his sons, Fáfnir and Reginn, and told them that the otter their
brother was slain, and who had done that deed.

It Now father and sons went up to the Æsir, seized them, bound them, and
told them about the otter, how he was Hreidmarr's son. The Æsir offered
a ransom for their lives, as much wealth as Hreidmarr himself desired to
appoint; and a covenant was made between them on those terms, and
confirmed with oaths. Then the otter was flayed, and Hreidmarr, taking
the otter-skin, bade them fill the skin with red gold and also cover it
altogether; and that should be the condition of the covenant between
them. Thereupon Odin sent Loki into the Land of the Black Elves, and he
came to the dwarf who is called Andvari, who was as a fish in the water.
Loki caught him in his hands and required of him in ransom of his life
all the gold that he had in his rock; and when they came within the
rock, the dwarf brought forth all the gold he had, and it was very much
wealth. Then the dwarf quickly swept under his hand one little gold
ring, but Loki saw it and commanded him to give over the ring. The dwarf
prayed him not to take the ring from him, saying that from this ring he
could multiply wealth for himself if he might keep it. Loki answered
that be should not have one penny left, and took the ring from him and
went out; but the dwarf declared that that ring should be the ruin of
every one who should come into possession of it. Loki replied that this
seemed well enough to him, and that this condition should hold good
provided that he himself brought it to the ears of them that should
receive the ring and the curse. He went his way and came to Hreidmarr's
dwelling, and showed the

{p. 152}

gold to Odin; but when Odin saw the ring, it seemed fair to him, and he
took it away from the treasure, and paid the gold to Hreidmarr. Then
Hreidmarr filled the otter-skin as much as he could, and set it up when
it was full. Next Odin went up, having the skin to cover with gold, and
he bade Hreidmarr look whether the skin were yet altogether hidden. But
Hreidmarr looked at it searchingly, and saw one of the hairs of the
snout, and commanded that this be covered, else their covenant should be
at an end. Then Odin drew out the ring, and covered the hair, saying
that they were now delivered from their debt for the slaying of the
otter. But when Odin had taken his spear, and Loki his shoes, and they
had no longer any need to be afraid, then Loki declared that the curse
which Andvari had uttered should be fulfilled: that this ring and this
gold should be the destruction of him who received it; and that was
fulfilled afterward. Now it has been told wherefore gold is called
Otter's Wergild, or Forced Payment of the Æsir, or Metal of Strife.

XL\. "What more is to be said of the gold? Hreidmarr took the gold for
his son's wergild, but Fáfnir and Reginn claimed some part of their
brother's blood-money for themselves. Hreidmarr would not grant them one
penny of the gold. This was the wicked purpose of those brethren: they
slew their father for the gold. Then Reginn demanded that Fáfnir share
the gold with him, half for half. Fáfnir answered that there was little
chance of his sharing it with his brother, seeing that he had slain his
father for its sake; and he bade Reginn go hence, else he should fare
even as Hreidmarr. Fáfnir had taken the helmet which Hreidmarr had
possessed, and set it upon his head (this helmet was

{p. 153}

called the Helm of Terror, of which all living creatures that see it are
afraid), and the sword called Hrotti. Reginn had that sword which was
named Refill. So he fled away, and Fáfnir went up to Gnita Heath, and
made himself a lair, and turned himself into a serpent, and laid him
down upon the gold.

"Then Reginn went to King Hjálprekr at Thjód, and there he became his
smith; and he took into his fostering Sigurdr, son of Sigmundr,
Völsungr's son, and of Hjördís, daughter of Eylimi. Sigurdr was. most
illustrious of all Host-Kings in race, in prowess, and in mind. Reginn
declared to him where Fáfnir lay on the gold, and incited him to seek
the gold. Then Reginn fashioned the sword Gramr, which was so sharp that
Sigurdr, bringing it down into running water, cut asunder a flock of
wool which drifted down-stream onto the sword's edge. Next Sigurdr clove
Reginn's anvil down to the stock with the sword. After that they went,
Sigurdr and Reginn, to Gnita Heath, and there Sigurdr dug a pit in
Fáfnr's way and laid him self in ambush therein. And when Fáfnir glided
toward the water and came above the pit, Sigurdr straightway thrust his
sword through him, and that was his end.

"Then Reginn came forward, saying that Sigurdr had slain his brother,
and demanded as a condition of reconciliation that he take Fáfnir's
heart and roast it with fire; and Reginn laid him down and drank the
blood of Fáfnir, and settled himself to sleep. But when Sigurdr was
roasting the heart, and thought that it must be quite roasted, he
touched it with his finger to see how hard it was; and then the juice
ran out from the heart onto his finger, so that he was burned and put
his finger to his mouth. As soon as the heart's blood came upon his
tongue, straightway he knew the speech

{p. 154}

of birds, and he understood what the nuthatches were saying which were
sitting in the trees. Then one spake:

There sits Sigurdr  
Blood-besprinkled,  
Fáfnir's heart  
With flame he roasteth:  
Wise seemed to me  
The Spoiler of Rings  
If the gleaming  
Life-fibre he ate.

There lies Reginn--sang another--  
Rede he ponders,  
Would betray the youth  
Who trusteth in him:  
In his wrath he plots  
Wrong accusation;  
The smith of bale  
Would avenge his brother.

Then Sigurdr went over to Reginn and slew him, and thence to his horse,
which was named Grani, and rode till he came to Fáfnir's lair. He took
up the gold, trussed it up in his saddle-bags, laid it upon Grani's
back, mounted up himself, and then rode his ways. Now the tale is told
why gold is called Lair or Abode of Fáfnir, or Metal of Gnita Heath, or
Grani's Burden.

XLI\. "Then Sigurdr rode on till he found a house on the mountain,
wherein a woman in helm and birnie lay sleeping. He drew his sword and
cut the birnie from her: she

{p. 155}

awoke then, and gave her name as Hildr: she is called Brynhildr, and was
a Valkyr. Sigurdr rode away and came to the king who was named Gjúki,
whose wife was Grímhildr; their children were Gunnarr, Högni, Gudrún,
Gudný; Gotthormr was Gjúki's stepson. Sigurdr tarried there a long time,
and then he obtained the hand of Gudrún, daughter of Gjúki, and Gunnarr
and Högni swore oaths of blood brotherhood with Sigurdr. Thereafter
Sigurdr and the sons of Gjúki went unto Atli, Budli's son, to sue for
the hand of Brynhildr his sister in marriage to Gunnarr. Brynhildr abode
on Hinda-Fell, and about her hall there was a flaring fire; and she had
made a solemn vow to take none but that man who should dare to ride
through the flaring fire.

"Then Sigurdr and the sons of Gjúki (who were also called Niflungs) rode
up onto the mountain, and Gunnarr should have ridden through the flaring
fire: but he had the horse named Goti, and that horse dared not leap
into the fire. So they exchanged shapes, Sigurdr and Gunnarr, and names
likewise; for Grani would go under no man but Sigurdr. Then Sigurdr
leapt onto Grani, and rode through the flaring fire. That eve he was
wedded with Brynhildr. But when they came to bed, he drew the Sword
Gramr from its sheath and laid it between them. In the morning when he
arose and clothed himself, he gave Brynhildr as linen-fee the same gold
ring which Loki had taken from Andvari, and took another ring from her
hand for remembrance. Then Sigurdr mounted his horse and rode to his
fellows, and he and Gunnarr changed shapes again and went home to Gjúki
with Brynhildr. Sigurdr and Gudrún had two children, Sigmundr and
Svanhildr.

"It befell on a time that Brynhildr and Gudrún went to the water to wash
their hair. And when they came to the

{p. 156}

river, Brynhildr waded out from the bank well into the river, saying
that she would not touch to her head the water which ran out of the hair
of Gudrún, since herself had the more valorous husband. Then Gudrún went
into the river after her and said that it was her right to wash her hair
higher upstream, for the reason that she had to husband such a man as
neither Gunnarr nor any other in the world matched in valor, seeing that
he had slain Fáfnir and Reginn and succeeded to the heritage of both.
And Brynhildr made answer: 'It was a matter of greater worth that
Gunnarr rode through the flaring fire and Sigurdr durst not.' Then
Gudrún laughed, and said: 'Dost thou think that Gunnarr rode through the
flaring fire? Now I think that he who went into the bride-bed with thee
was the same that gave me this gold ring; and the gold ring which thou
bearest on thine hand and didst receive for linen-fee is called
Andvari's Yield, and I believe that it was not Gunnarr who got that ring
on Gnita Heath.' Then Brynhildr was silent, and went home.

"After that she egged on Gunnarr and Högni to slay Sigurdr; but because
they were Sigurdr's sworn blood-brothers, they stirred up Gotthormr
their brother to slay him. He thrust his sword through Sigurdr as he
slept; but when Sigurdr felt the wound, he hurled his sword Gramr after
Gotthormr, so that it cut the man asunder at the middle. There fell
Sigurdr and Sigmundr, his son of three winters, whom they slew. Then
Brynhildr stabbed herself with a sword, and she was burned with Sigurdr;
but Gunnarr and Högni took Fáfnir's heritage and Andvari's Yield, and
ruled the lands thereafter.

"King Atli, Budli's son, and brother of Brynhildr, then wedded Gudrún,
whom Sigurdr had had to wife; and they

{p. 157}

had children. King Atli invited to him Gunnarr and Högni, and they came
at his invitation. Yet before they departed from their land, they hid
the gold, Fáfnir's heritage, in the Rhine, and that gold has never since
been found. Now King Atli had a host in readiness, and fought with
Gunnarr and Högni; and they were made captive. King Atli bade . the
heart be cut out of Högni alive, and that was his end. Gunnarr he caused
to be cast into a den of serpents. But a harp was brought secretly to
Gunnarr, and he struck it with his toes, his hands being bound; he
played the harp so that all the serpents fell asleep, saving only one
adder, which glided over to him, and gnawed into the cartilage of his
breast-bone so far that her head sank within the wound, and she clove to
his liver till he died. Gunnarr and Högni were called Niflungs and
Gjúkungs, for which reason gold is called Treasure, or Heritage, of the
Niflungs.

\["A little while after, Gudrún slew her two sons, and caused flagons to
be made of their skulls, set with gold and silver. Then the
funeral-feast was held for the Niflungs; and at this feast Gudrún had
mead poured into the flagons for King Atli, and the mead was mixed with
the blood of the boys. Moreover, she caused their hearts to be roasted
and set before the king, that he might eat of them. And when he had
eaten, then she herself told him what she had done, with many scathing
words. There was no lack of strong drink there, so that most of the
company had fallen asleep where they sat. That night she went to the
king while he slept, and Högni's son with her; they smote the king, and
that was the death of him. Then they set fire to the hall, and burned
the folk that were within. After that she went to the shore and leaped
into the sea, desiring to make

{p. 158}

an end of herself; but she was tossed by the billows over the firth, and
was borne to King Jónakr's land. And when he saw her, he took her to him
and wedded her, and they had three sons, called Sörli, Hamdir, and Erpr:
they were all raven-black of hair, like Gunnarr and Högni and the other
Niflungs. There Svanhildr, daughter of the youth Sigurdr, was reared,
and of all women she was fairest. King Jörmunrekkr the Mighty learned of
her beauty, and sent his son Randvér to woo her and bring her to be his
wife. When Randvér had come to the court of Jónakr, Svanhildr was given
into his hands, and he should have! brought her to King Jörmunrekkr. But
Earl Bikki said that it was a better thing for Randvér to wed
Svandhildr, since he and she were both young, whereas Jörmunrekkr was
old. This counsel pleased the young folk well. Thereupon Bikki reported
the matter to the king. Straightway, King Jörmunrekkr commanded that his
son be seized and led to the gallows. Then Randvér took his hawk and
plucked off ins feathers, and bade that it be sent so to his father;
after which he was hanged. But when King Jörmunrekkr saw the hawk,
suddenly it came home to him that even as the hawk was featherless and
powerless to fly, so was his kingdom shorn of its might, since he was
old and childless. Then King Jörmunrekkr, riding out of the wood where
he had been hunting, beheld Svanhildr as she sat washing her hair: they
rode upon her and trod her to death under their horses' feet.

"But when Gudrún learned of this, she urged on her sons to take
vengeance for Svanhildr. When they were preparing for their journey, she
gave them birnies and helmets so strong that iron could not bite into
them. She laid these instructions upon them: that, when they were come
to King Jörmunrekkr, they should go up to him by night as he slept:

{p. 159}

Sörli and Hamdir should hew off his hands and feet, and Erpr his head.
But when they were on their way, they asked Erpr what help they might
expect from him, if they met King Jörmunrekkr. He answered that he would
render them such aid as the hand affords the foot. They said that that
help which the foot received from the hand was altogether nothing. They
were so wroth with their mother that she had sent them away with angry
words, and they desired so eagerly to do what would seem worst to her,
that they slew Erpr, because she loved him most of all. A little later,
while Sörli was walking, one of his feet slipped, and he supported
himself on his hand; and he said: 'Now the hand assists the foot indeed;
it were better now that Erpr were living.' Now when they came to King
Jörmunrekkr by night, where he was sleeping, and hewed hands and feet
off him, he awoke and called upon his men, and bade them arise. And then
Hamdir spake, saying: 'The head had been off by now, if Erpr lived.'
Then the henchmen rose up and attacked them, but could not overmaster
them with weapons; and Jörmunrekkr called out to them to beat them with
stones, and it was done. There Sörli and Hamdir fell, and now all the
house and offspring of Gjúki were dead. A daughter named Áslaug lived
after young Sigurdr; she was reared with Heimir in Hlymdalir, and great
houses are sprung from her. It is said that Sigmundr, Völsungr's son,
was so strong that he could drink venom and receive no hurt; and
Sinfjötli his son and Sigurdr were so hard-skinned that no venom from
without could harm them: wherefore Bragi the Skald has sung thus:

When the wriggling Serpent  
Of the Völsung's Drink hung writhing

{p. 160}

On the hook of the Foeman  
Of Hill-Giants' kindred.

Most skalds have made verses and divers short tales from these sagas.
Bragi the Old wrote of the fall of Sörli and Hamdir in that song of
praise which he composed on Ragnarr Lodbrók:

Once Jörmunrekkr awakened  
To an dream, 'mid the princes  
Blood-stained, while swords were swirling:  
A brawl burst in the dwelling  
Of Randvér's royal kinsman,  
When the raven-swarthy  
Brothers of Erpr took vengeance  
For all the bitter sorrows.

The bloody dew of corpses,  
O'er the king's couch streaming,  
Fell on the floor where, severed,  
Feet and hands blood-dripping  
Were seen; in the ale-cups' fountain  
He fell headlong, gore-blended:  
On the Shield, Leaf of the Bushes  
Of Leifi's Land, 't is painted.

There stood the shielded swordsmen,  
Steel biting not, surrounding  
The king's couch; and the brethren  
Hamdir and Sörli quickly  
To the earth were beaten  
By the prince's order,

{p. 161}

To the Bride of Odin  
With hard stones were battered.

The swirling weapons' Urger  
Bade Gjúki's race be smitten  
Sore, who from life were eager  
To ravish Svanhildr's lover;  
And all pay Jónakr's offspring  
With the fair-piercing weapon,  
The render of blue birnies,  
With bitter thrusts and edges.

I see the heroes' slaughter  
On the fair shield-rim's surface;  
Ragnarr gave me the Ship-Moon  
With many tales marked on it.\]

XLII\. "Why is gold called Fródi's Meal? This is the tale thereof: One
of Odin's sons, named Skjöldr,--from whom the Skjöldungs are come,--had
his abode and ruled in the realm which now is called Denmark, but then
was known as Gotland. Skjöldr's son, who ruled the land after him, was
named Fridleifr. Fridleifr's son was Fródi: he succeeded to the kingdom
after his father, in the time when Augustus Caesar imposed peace on all
the world; at that time Christ was born. But because Fródi was mightiest
of all kings in the Northern lands, the peace was called by his name
wherever the Danish tongue was spoken; and men call it the Peace of
Fródi. No man injured any other, even though he met face to face his
father's slayer or his brother's, loose or bound. Neither was there any
thief nor robber then, so that a gold ring lay long on Jalangr's Heath.
King Fródi

{p. 162}

went to a feast in Sweden at the court of the king who was called
Fjölnir, and there he bought two maid-servants, Fenja and Menja: they
were huge and strong. In that time two mill-stones were found in
Denmark, so great that no one was so strong that he could turn them: the
nature of the mill was such that whatsoever he who turned asked for, was
ground out by the mill-stones. This mill was called Grótti. He who gave
King Fródi the mill was named Hengikjöptr. King Fródi had the
maid-servants led to the mill, and bade them grind gold; and they did
so. First they ground gold and, peace and happiness for Fródi; then he
would grant them rest or sleep no longer than the cuckoo held its peace
or a song might be sung. It is said that they sang the song which is
called the Lay of Grótti, and this is its beginning:

Now are we come  
To the king's house,  
The two fore-knowing,  
Fenja and Menja:  
These are with Fródi  
Son of Fridleifr,  
The Mighty Maidens,  
As maid-thralls held.

And before they ceased their singing, they ground out a host against
Fródi, so that the sea-king called Mýsingr came there that same night
and slew Fródi, taking much plunder. Then the Peace of Fródi was ended.
Mýsingr took Grótti with him, and Fenja and Menja also, and bade them
grind salt. And at midnight they asked whether Mýsingr were not weary of
salt. He bade them grind longer. They had ground but a little while,
when down sank the ship; and from that

{p. 163}

time there has been a whirlpool the sea where the water falls through
the hole in the mill-stone. It was then that the sea became salt.

\["The lay of Grótti:

They to the flour-mill  
Were led, those maidens,  
And bidden tirelessly  
To turn the gray mill-stone:  
He promised to neither  
Peace nor surcease  
Till he had heard  
The handmaids' singing.

They chanted the song  
Of the ceaseless mill-stone:  
'Lay we the bins right,  
Lift we the stones!'  
He urged the maidens  
To grind on ever.

They sung and slung  
The whirling stone  
Till the men of Fródi  
For the most part slept;  
Then spake Menja,  
To the mill coming:

'Wealth grind we for Fródi,  
We grind it in plenty,

{p. 164}

Fullness of fee  
At the mill of fortune:  
Let him sit on riches  
And sleep on down;  
Let him wake in weal:  
Then well 't is ground.

Here may no one  
Harm another,  
Contrive evil,  
Nor cast wiles for slaying,  
Nor slaughter any  
With sword well sharpened,  
Though his brother's slayer  
In bonds he find.'

But he spake no word  
Save only this:  
'Sleep ye no longer  
Than the hall-cuckoo's silence,  
Nor longer than so,  
While one song is sung.'

'Thou wast not, Fródi,  
Full in wisdom,  
Thou friend of men,  
When thou boughtest the maidens:  
Didst choose for strength  
And outward seeming;  
But of their kindred  
Didst not inquire.

{p. 164}

'Hardy was Hrungnir,  
And his father;  
Yet was Thjazi  
Than they more mighty:  
Idi and Aurnir  
Of us twain are kinsmen,--  
Brothers of Hill-Giants,  
Of them were we born.

Grótti had not come  
From the gray mountain,  
Nor the hard boulder  
From the earth's bosom,  
Nor thus would grind  
The Hill-Giants' maiden,  
If any had known  
The news of her.

'We nine winters  
Were playmates together,  
Mighty of stature,  
'Neath the earth's surface,  
The maids had part  
In mighty works:  
Ourselves we moved  
Mighty rocks from their place.

'We rolled the rock  
O'er the Giants' roof-stead,  
So that the ground,  
Quaking, gave before us;

{p. 166}

So slung we  
The whirling stone,  
The mighty boulder,  
Till men took it.

'And soon after  
In Sweden's realm,  
We twain fore-knowing  
Strode to the fighting;  
Bears we hunted,  
And shields we broke;  
We strode through  
The gray-mailed spear-host.

We cast down a king,  
We crowned another;  
To Gotthormr good  
We gave assistance;  
No quiet was there  
Ere Knúi fell.

'This course we held  
Those years continuous,  
That we were known  
For warriors mighty;  
There with sharp spears  
Wounds we scored,  
Let blood from wounds,  
And reddened the brand.

'Now are we come  
To the king's abode

{p. 167}

Of mercy bereft  
And held as bond-maids;  
Clay eats our foot-soles,  
Cold chills us above;  
We turn the Peace-Grinder:  
'T is gloomy at Fródi's.

'Hands must rest,  
The stone must halt;  
Enough have I turned,  
My toil ceases:  
Now may the hands  
Have no remission  
Till Fródi hold  
The meal ground fully.

'The hands should hold  
The hard shafts,  
The weapons gore-stained,--  
Wake thou, Fródi!  
Wake thou, Fródi,  
If thou wouldst hearken  
To the songs of us twain  
And to ancient stories.

'Fire I see burning  
East of the burg,  
War-tidings waken,  
A beacon of warning:  
A host shall come  
Hither, with swiftness,

{p. 168}

And fire the dwellings  
Above King Fródi.

'Thou shalt not hold  
The stead of Hleidr,  
The red gold rings  
Nor the gods' holy altar;  
We grasp the handle,  
Maiden, more hardly,--  
We were not warmer  
In the wound-gore of corpses.

'My father's maid  
Mightily ground  
For she saw the feyness  
Of men full many;  
The sturdy posts  
From the flour-box started,  
Made staunch with iron.  
Grind we yet swifter.

'Grind we yet swifter!  
The son of Yrsa,  
Hálfdanr's kinsman,  
Shall come with vengeance  
On Fródi's head:  
Him shall men call  
Yrsa's son and brother.  
We both know that.'

The maidens ground,  
Their might they tested,

{p. 169}

Young and fresh  
In giant-frenzy:  
The bin-poles trembled,  
And burst the flour-box;  
In sunder burst  
The heavy boulder.

And the sturdy bride  
Of Hill-Giants spake:  
'We have ground, O Fródi!  
Soon we cease from grinding;  
The women have labored  
O'er long at the grist.'

Thus sang Einarr Skúlason:

I have heard that Fródi's hand-maids  
Ground in the mill full gladly  
The Serpent's Couch; with gold-meal  
The king lets peace be broken:  
The fair cheeks of my axe-head,  
Fitted with maple, show forth  
Fenja's Grist; exalted  
Is the skald with the good king's riches.

So sang Egill:

Glad are full many men  
In Fródi's meal.\]

XLIII\. "Why is gold called Kraki's Seed? In Denmark there was a king
called Hrólfr Kraki: he was most renowned

{p. 170}

of all ancient kings for munificence, valor, and graciousness. One
evidence of his graciousness which is often brought into stories is
this: A little lad and poor, Vöggr by name, came into the hall of King
Hrólfr. At that time the king was young, and of slender stature. Vöggr
came into his presence and looked up at him; and the king said: 'What
wouldst thou say, lad, for thou lookest at me?' Vöggr answered: 'When I
was at home, I heard say that Hrólfr the king at Hleidr was the greatest
man in the northern lands; but now there sitteth in the high seat a
little pole, and he is called King.' Then the king made answer: 'Thou,
boy, hast given me a name, so that I shall be called Hrólfr the Pole
(Kraki); and it is the custom that the giving of a name be accompanied
by a gift. Now I see that with the name which thou has fastened on me,
thou hast no gift such as would be acceptable to me, wherefore he that
has wherewith to give shall give to the other.' And he took from his
hand a gold ring and gave it to him. Then Vöggr said: 'Above all kings
be thou most blessed of givers! Now I swear an oath that I shall be that
man's slayer who slays thee.' Then spake the king, laughing loudly:
'Vöggr is pleased with a small thing.'

"Another example is the tale told concerning the valor of Hrólfr Kraki:
That king whom men call Adils ruled over Uppsala; he had to wife Yrsa,
mother of Hrólfr Kraki. He was at strife with the king who ruled over
Norway, whose name was Ali; the two joined battle on the ice of the lake
called Vaeni. King Adils sent an embassy to Hrólfr Kraki, his stepson,
praying him to come to his aid, and promised wages to all his host so
long as they should be away; King Hrólfr himself should have three
precious gifts, whatsoever three he might choose from all Sweden. {p.
171} King Hrólfr could not make the journey in person, owing to the
strife in which he was engaged with the Saxons; but he sent to Adils his
twelve berserks: Bödvar-Bjarki was there for one, and Hjalti the
Stout-Hearted, Hvítserkr the Stern, Vöttr Véseti, and the brethren
Svipdagr and Beigudr. In that battle King Áli fell, and the great part
of his host with him; and King Adils took from him in death the helm
Battle-Swine and his horse Raven. Then the berserks of Hrólfr Kraki
demanded for their hire three pounds of gold for each man of them; and
in addition they required that they might bear to Hrólfr Kraki those
gifts of price which they had chosen for him: which were the Helm
Battle-Boar and the birnie Finn's Heritage,--on neither of which iron
would take hold,--and the gold ring which was called Pig of the Swedes,
which Adils' forefathers had had. But the king denied them all these
things, nor did he so much as pay their hire: the berserks went away
ill-pleased with their share, and told the state of things to Hrólfr
Kraki.

"Straightway he begin his journey to Uppsala; and when he had brought
his ships into the river Fýri, he rode at once to Uppsala, and his
twelve berserks with him, all without safe-conduct. Yrsa, his mother,
welcomed him and led him to lodgings, but not to the king's hall: fires
were made there before them, and ale was given them to drink. Then men
of King Adils came in and heaped firewood onto the fire, and made it so
great that the clothes were burnt off Hrólfr and his men. And the
fellows spake: 'Is it true that Hrólfr Kraki and his berserks shun
neither fire nor iron?' Then Hrólfr Kraki leapt up, and all they that
were with him; and he said:

{p. 172}

'Add we to the fire  
In Adils' dwelling!'

took his shield and cast it onto the fire, and leapt over the flames,
while the shield burnt; and he spake again:

'He flees not the flames  
Who o'er the fire leapeth!'

Even so did his men, one after another; and they laid hands on those
fellows who had heaped up the fire, and cast them into the flames. Then
Yrsa came and gave Hrólfr Kraki a deer's horn full of gold, the ring Pig
of the Swedes being with the gold; and she bade them ride away to the
host. They vaulted onto their horses and rode down into the Plain of the
Fýri; and soon they saw King Adils riding after them with his host all
in armor, hoping to slay them. Then Hrólfr Kraki plunged his right hand
down into the horn, grasped the gold, and strewed it all about the road.
When the Swedes saw that, they leapt down out of their saddles, and each
took up as much as he could lay hold of; but King Adils bade them ride
on, and himself rode furiously . His horse was called Slöngvir, swiftest
of all horses. Then Hrólfr Kraki saw that King Adils was drawing close
up to him, took the ring, Pig of the Swedes, and threw it toward him,
and bade him receive it as a gift. King Adils rode at the ring and
thrust at it with his spear-point, and let it slide down over the
shaft-socket. Then Hrólfr Kraki turned back and saw how he bent down,
and spake: 'Now I have made him who is mightiest of Swedes stoop as a
swine stoops.' Thus they parted. For this cause gold is called Seed of
Kraki or of Fýri's Plain. Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:

{p. 173}

God of the blade of battle,  
We bear through Hákon's life-days  
The Seed of Fýri's valley  
On our arms, where sits the falcon.

Even as Thjódólfr sang:

The king sows the bright seed-corn  
Of knuckle-splendid gold rings,  
With the crop of Yrsa's offspring,  
In his company's glad hand-grasp;  
The guileless 'Land-Director  
With Kraki's gleaming barley  
Sprinkles my arms, the flesh-grown  
Seat of the hooded falcon.

XLIV\. "It is said that the king called Hölgi, from whom Hálogaland is
named, was the father of Thorgerdr Hölgabrúdr; sacrifice was made to
both of them, and a cairn was raised over Hölgi: one layer of gold or
silver (that was the sacrificial money), and another layer of mould and
stones. Thus sang Skúli Thorsteinsson:

When I reddened Reifnir's Roof-Bane,  
The ravening sword, for wealth's sake  
At Svöldr, I heaped with gold rings  
Warlike Hölgi's cairn-thatch.

In the ancient *Bjarkamál* many terms for gold are told: it says there:

The king most gift-gracious  
His guardsmen enriched

{p. 174}

With Fenja's Labor,  
With Fáfnir's Midgard,  
Glasir's bright Needles,  
Grani's fair Burden,  
Draupnir's dear dripping,  
Down of Grafvitnir.

The free-handed Lord gave,  
The heroes accepted,  
Sif's firm-grown tresses,  
Ice of the bow-force,  
Otter-gild unwilling,  
Weeping of Mardöll,  
Fire-flame of Órun,  
Idi's fine Speeches.

The warrior rejoiced;  
We walked in fair garments,  
In Thjazi's counsels  
The people's host-countless,  
In the Rhine's red metal,  
Wrangling of Niflungs,  
The leader war-daring,  
Warded Baldr not.

XLV\. Gold is metaphorically termed Fire of the Hand, or of the Limb, or
of the Leg, because it is red; but silver is called Snow, or Ice, or
Hoar-Frost, because it is white. In like manner, gold or silver may be
periphrased in metaphors of purse, or crucible, or lather, and both
silver and gold may be called Hand-Stone, or Necklace, of any man who
was

{p. 175}

wont to have a necklace. Necklaces and rings are both silver and gold,
if no other distinction is raised.

As Thorleikr the Fair sang:

The kindly Prince the Load casts  
Of Crucibles on the Hawk-Seats  
Of thanes, the wrists embellished,--  
Gives Embers of the Arm-joint.

And as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

The land-strong King of Lurid  
Breaks the golden Limb-Brands;  
I think the Prince of Warriors  
Lacks not the Rhine's bright Pebbles.

Thus sang Einarr Skúlason:

The Purse-Snow and the Sea-Fire  
Lie on both sides of the axe-head  
Blood-spilling; 't is my office  
To praise our foemen's Scather.

And as he sang further:

The Sea-Glow each day standeth  
O'er the Crucible's white Snow-Drift,  
And the shield, ships' cheeks protecting,  
Shelters a heart most lavish;  
Ne'er can one melt the silver  
Flagon-Snow in the Fire-Flame  
Of the Eel's Stream-Road; the Feller  
Of Hosts all feats performeth.

176

Here gold is called Fire of the Eel's Stream-Road; and silver, Snow of
Flagons.

Thus sang Thórdr Mæri's Skald:

The glad Giver of the Hand-Waste  
Of the Gold-Minisher perceiveth  
That the Hermódr of the Snake's Lair  
Hath had a lordly father.

XLVI\. "Man is called Breaker of Gold, even as Óttarr the Swarthy sang:

I needs must use the Breaker  
Of the Battle-Glow of good men;  
Here is the watch war-doughty  
Of the Wise King assembled.

Or Gold-Sender, as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

The Sender of Gold permitteth  
The silent earth to hearken  
To song; his gifts I gather:  
The prince his young men gladdens.

Gold-Caster, as Thorleikr sang:

Gold-Caster makes loyal to him  
His guard with kingly armor.

Gold's Adversary, as sang Thorvaldr Blending-Skald:

The gold's foe Hot Coals casteth  
Of the Arm; the king gives red wealth;

{p. 177}

The vile folk's Desolator  
Dispenseth the Freight of Grani.

Gold-Towerer, as is written here:

The Gold-Towerer in friendship  
I got, and of the Warrior,  
Son of the glowing War-Blade,  
I make a song of praise.

Woman is periphrased in metaphors of gold, being called Willow or Giver
of Gold, as Hallarsteinn sang:

He who casts the Amber  
Of Vidblindi's Boar's cool, salt Drink,  
Long will recall the Willow  
Of the Reed-Snake's golden River.

Here the whale is called Boar of Vidblindi; this Vidblindi was a giant
who drew whales out of the sea like fishes. The Drink of Whales is the
sea; Amber of the Sea is gold; woman is the Willow, or Dealer, of that
gold which she gives; and the willow is a tree. Therefore, as is already
shown, woman is periphrased with all manner of feminine tree-names: she
is also called User of that which she gives; and the word for 'user'
also signifies a log, the tree which falls in the forest.

Thus sang Gunnlaugr Serpent's-Tongue:

That dame was born to stir strife  
Among the sons of men-folk;  
The War-Bush caused that; madly  
I yearned to have the Wealth-Log.

{p. 178}

Woman is called Forest; so sang Hallarsteinn:

With the well-trained Plane of Singing,  
The tongue, I have planed, my Lady,  
Dame of the First Song's ale-vats,  
Forest fair of Flagons.

Fagot, as Steinn sang:

Thou shalt, O fresh Sif-Tender  
Of the Flood's gold Fire, like other  
Fagots of Hjadnings' gravel,  
Break with thy good fortune.

Prop, as Ormr Steinthórsson sang:

The Prop of Stone was clothèd  
In garments clean and seemly:  
A new cloak did the hero  
Cast o'er the Mead's bright Valkyr.

Post, as Steinarr sang:

All my dreams of the gracious Goddess  
Of the bracelet-girded soft arms  
Have lied to me; the Stream-Moon's  
Unsteadfast Prop beguiled me.

Birch, as Ormr sang:

For a mark of the Birch  
Of the bright hollow ring,  
The palm-flame, I laid  
On the dwarf-flagon, my song.

{p. 179}

Oak, even as stands here:

The fair shaped Oak of Riches  
Stands, our mirth forestalling.

Linden, even as is written here:

O dreadful, towering Elm-Tree  
Of the dinning shower of weapons,  
Our courage shall not lessen:  
So bade the Linen's Linden.

Man is periphrased in tree-metaphors, as we have written before; he is
called Rowan, or Tester, of Weapons, or of Combats, of Expeditions and
of Deeds, of Ships, and of all that which he wields and tests; thus sang
Úlfr Uggason:

But the flashing-eyed stiff Edge-Rope  
Of the Earth stared past the gunwale  
At the Rowan-Tree of the people  
Of Stone, the Giant-Tester.

Tree and Beam, as Kormákr sang:

The Beam of the murdering Sword-Twig  
Is taller than are many  
In the Din of Darts; the sword wins.  
The land for dauntless Sigurdr.

Grove, as sang Hallfredr Troublous-Skald:

The Mighty Grove and Faithful  
Of the Shield-Murderer, budded

{p. 180}

With hair, stands in the Eastlands  
Safe with Ullr's Ash-Warriors.

Here he is also called Ash.

Box, as Arnórr sang:

The Box of Ships bade the Rygir  
Bring the shields together  
At early dusk; through the spear-rain  
Of strife-clouds held the autumn night.

Ash, as Refr sang:

The Strife-Lord, gracious Giver,  
Sought the Maid's bed gold-sprinkled;  
The Ash of Odin's War-Sleet  
Won the estate of manhood.

Maple, as here:

Hail, Maple of the Ice-Lumps  
Of the Hand!' So spake the Birnie.

Tree, as Refr sang:

Since I have appointed  
To proffer Odin's Breast-Sea,  
The War-God's Verse, to Thorsteinn;  
The Tree of Swords so wills it.

Staff, as Óttarr sang:

Thou, fierce War-Staff, maintainedst  
Maugre two kings, thy borders

{p. 181}

With heroes' kin, where the ravens  
Starved not; keen-hearted art thou.

Thorn, as Arnórr sang:

He gathered, the young Wealth-Thorn,  
Many great heaps of corpses  
For the eagles, and his henchmen  
Guided and helped the hero.

XLVII\. "How should battle be periphrased? By calling it Storm of
Weapons or of Sheltering Shields, or of Odin or the Valkyrs, or of
Host-Kings; and Din and Clashing.

Thus sang Hornklofi:

The king hath held a Spear-Storm  
With heroes, where the eagles  
Screamed at the Din of Skögul;  
The red wounds spat out blood.

Thus sang Eyvindr:

And that hero  
At Háar's Tempest  
Wore a sark  
Of gray wolf-skin.

Thus sang Bersi:

In earlier days I seemed not  
To Gunn's War-Bushes useful  
In the Sleet of Hlökk, when younger  
We were: so 't is said.

{p. 182}

Thus sang Einarr:

The stark prince lets Hildr's Shield-Sails  
Take the sternest crashing Storm-Wind  
Of the Valkyr, where hail of bow-strings  
Drives; the sword-blade hammers.

As Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

The mail-sarks of the warriors,  
Firm-woven, did not shelter  
The seemly youths 'gainst Högni's  
Showers of Hákon's onset.

Even as here:

They set the Point-Net's edge-band  
Against the Point-Crash-Urger.

And again:

'Neath eagles' claws the king's foes  
Sank at the Clash of Göndul.

XLVIII\. "Weapons and armor should be periphrased in figures of battle,
and with reference to Odin and the Valkyrs and host-kings: one should
call a helmet Cowl, or Hood; a birnie, Sark, or Kirtle; a shield, Tent;
and a shield-wall is termed Hall and Roof, Wall and Floor. Shields,
periphrased in figures of warships, are called Sun, or Moon, or Leaf, or
Sheen, or Garth, of the Ship; the shield is also called Ship of Ullr, or
periphrased in terms of Hrungnir's feet, since he stood upon his shield.
On ancient shields it

{p. 183}

was customary to paint a circle, which was called the 'ring,' and
shields are called in metaphors of that ring. Hewing weapons, axes or
swords, are called Fires of Blood, or of Wounds; swords are called
Odin's Fires; but men call axes by the names of troll-women, and
periphrase them in terms of blood or wounds or a forest or wood.
Thrusting weapons are properly periphrased by calling them by names of
serpents or fishes. Missile weapons are often metaphorically termed hail
or sleet or storm. Variants of all these figures have been made in many
ways, for they are used chiefly in poems of praise, where there is need
of such metaphors.

So sang Víga-Glúmr:

With the Hanged-God's helmet  
The hosts have ceased from going  
By the brink; not pleasant  
The bravest held the venture.

Thus sang Einarr Tinkling-Scale:

Helm-folded strife-bold Búi,--  
Who from the south went forth  
Into Gunn's Crash,--and din-swift  
Sigvaldi offered battle.

Sark of Ródi, as Tindr sang:

When came the birnied Hákon  
To cast away the ring-rent  
Streaming Sark of Odin,  
Ródi's rocking sea-steeds were cleared.

{p. 184}

Hamdir's Kirtle, as Hallfredr sang:

The war-sleet hard and streaming  
Of Egill's weapons breaketh  
Fiercely on Hamdir's Kirtles  
Of the foremost wave-deer's warriors.

Sörli's Garments, as he sang further:

Thence the bright Weeds of Sörli  
In men's blood must be reddened;  
I hear it clearly: Wound-Fire  
In cutting showers of iron.

Shields are called Tents of Hlökk, as Grettír sang:

Hlökk's Tent-Raisers held their noses  
Together, and the heroes  
Of the Rain-Storm of Hildr's Shield-Wall  
Hewed at each other's beards.

Ródi's Roof, as Einarr sang:

Ródi's Roof's great Ice-Lump  
For the Rain of Freyja's Eyelids  
Grows not less, my fair axe-head;  
His age my lord so useth.

Wall of Hildr, as Grettír sang, and as we have written before.

Ship-Sun, as Einarr sang:

In the sea Ólafr's Kinsman  
Reddens the flame of the Ship-Sun.

{p. 185}

Moon of the Ship's Cheek, as Refr sang:

Fair was the day, when Scatterers  
Of Arm-Fire thrust the clear Moon  
Of the Cheek into my hand-clasp,  
The coiling track of red rings.

Ship's Garth, as here:

The swift Sweller of the Spear-Crash  
Shot through the stain-dyed Prow-Garth  
As it were birch-bark; truly  
He was a bitter battler.

Ash of Ullr, as here:

The Snow-Gusts of Ullr's Ash-Ship  
Grimly o'er our Prince shoot  
With fullness, where are tossing  
The fearsome covered spike-spars.

Blade of Hrungnir's Foot-Soles, as Bragi sang:

Wilt hear, O Hrafnketill,  
How I shall praise the Sole-Blade  
Of Thrúdr's thief, stain-covered  
With skill, and praise my king.

Bragi the Skald sang this concerning the ring on the shield:

Unless it be, that Sigurdr's  
Renowned Son would have payment  
In good kind for the ring-nave  
Of the Ringing Wheel of Hildr.

{p. 186}

He called the shield Wheel of Hildr, and the ring the Nave of the Wheel.

Ring-Earth, as Hallvardr sang:

The Chief of ranks of Combat  
Sees the red-gleaming Ring-Earth  
Fly in two parts; the white disk,  
The pictured, bursts in sunder.

It is also sung:

A ring befits the shield best;  
Arrows befit the bow.

A sword is Odin's Fire, as Kormákr sang:

The fight swelled, when the Warrior,  
The Wolf's blithe Feeder, in tumult  
Fared with Odin's ringing Fire-Flame;  
Urdr came forth from the Well.

Fire of the Helm, as Úlfr Uggason sang:

The very mighty Maiden  
Of the Mountain made the Sea-Horse  
Roll forward, but the Champions  
Of Odin's Helm-Fire felled her Wolf-Steed.

Fire of the Birnie, as Glúmr Geirason sang:

At that the Land-Protector  
Let the Birnie's Streaming Fire whine,  
Hone-whetted, he who warded  
Him strongly 'gainst the warriors.

{p. 187}

Ice of the Rim, and Hurt of Sheltering Weapons, as Einarr sang:

I received the Ice of Wed Rims,  
With Freyja's golden Eye-Thaw,  
From the upright prince high-hearted;  
We bear in hand the Helm's Hurt.

An axe is called Troll-Woman of Sheltering Weapons, as Einarr sang:

Ræfill's Sea-Steed's Riders  
May see how, richly carven,  
The dragons close are brooding  
'Gainst the brow of the Helm-Ogress.

A spear is called Serpent, as Refr sang:

My angry Murky Serpent  
Of the markings of the Shield-Board  
Savagely doth sport, in  
My palms, where men in strife meet.

Arrows are called Hail of the Bow or Bowstring, or of the  
Shelters, or of Battle, as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

The hammering King of Swords shook  
From the Sails of Hlökk the Bow-Hail:  
Bravely the Wolf's Supporter  
Warded his life in battle.

And Hallfredr:

And the armor of the Spear-Sleet,  
Knitted with iron, saved not

{p. 188}

The saters of hungry ravens  
From the Shaft-Hail of the Bowstring.

And Eyvindr Skald- Despoiler:

They said, O Hörds' Land-Warder,  
Thy spirit little faltered,  
When the Birnie's Hail in the wound burst;  
Bent were the stringèd elm-bows.

XLIX\. "Battle is called Storm or Snow-Shower of the Hjadnings, and
weapons are termed Fire or Wands of Hjadnings; and this is the tale
thereof: that king who was called Högni had a daughter named Hildr: her
King Hedinn, son of Hjarrandi, took as the spoils of war, while King
Högni attended an assembly of kings. But when he learned that there had
been raiding in his realm and his daughter had been borne off, he
departed with his host to seek Hedinn, and heard tidings of him, that he
was proceeding northward along the land. When Högni had come into
Norway, he learned that Hedinn had sailed westward over the sea. Then
Högni sailed after him, even to the Orkneys; and when he landed at the
place called Hoy, Hedinn was already there before him with his host.
Then Hildr went to meet her father, and offered him a necklace on
Hedinn's behalf, for reconciliation and peace; but if it were not
accepted, she said, Hedinn was ready to fight, and Högni might hope for
no mercy at his hands.

"Högni answered his daughter harshly; and when she returned to Hedinn,
she told him that Högni desired no reconciliation, and she bade him make
ready for battle. So did both parties: they went to the island and
marshalled

{p. 189}

their hosts. Then Hedinn called to Högni his father-in-law, offering him
reconciliation and much gold in compensation. But Högni answered: 'Thou
hast made this offer over-late, if thou wouldst make peace: for now I
have drawn Dáinsleif, which the dwarves made, and which must cause a
man's death every time it is bared, nor ever fails in its stroke;
moreover, the wound heals not if one be scratched with it.' Then said
Hedinn: 'Thou dost boast in the sword, but not in the victory; I call
any sword good which is faithful to its lord.' Then they began that
famous battle which is called the Hjadnings' Strife, and they fought all
that day, but at evening the kings went to their ships. Now Hildr went
to the slain by night, and with magic quickened all those that were
dead. The next day the kings went to the battlefield and fought, and so
did all those that had fallen on the day before. So the fight went one
day after the other: all who fell, and all those weapons which lay on
the field, and the shields also, were turned to stone; but when day
dawned, up rose all the dead men and fought, and all weapons were
renewed. It is said in songs that in this fashion the Hjadnings shall
continue unto the Weird of the Gods. Bragi the Skald composed verses
after this tale in Ragnarr Lodbrók's *Song of Praise*:

And the belovèd Maiden  
Of the veins' blood-letting  
Purposed to bring, for wrath's sake,  
The bow-storm to her father:  
When the ring-wearing lady,  
The woman full of evil,  
Bore the neck-ring of War-Doom  
To the Battler of the Wind's Steeds.

{p. 190}

That gory Wound-Amender  
To the glorious Monarch offered  
The necklace not for fear's sake,  
At the mote of fatal weapons:  
Ever as restraining battle  
She seemed, although she goaded  
Warriors to walk the death-road  
With the ravening Wolf's dire Sister.

The Prince of Folk, the Land-God,  
Let not the fight, wolf-gladdening,  
Halt, nor slaughter on the sands cease,--  
Hate, deadly, swelled in Högni,  
When the stern Lords of Sword-Din  
Sought Hedinn with stern weapons,  
Rather than receive  
The necklet-rings of Hildr.

And that baleful Witch of Women,  
Wasting the fruits of victory,  
Took governance on the island  
O'er the axe, the Birnie's Ruin;  
All the Ship-King's war-host  
Went wrathful 'neath the firm shields  
Of Hjarrajidi, swift-marching  
From Reifnir's fleet sea-horses.

On the fair shield of Svölnir  
One may perceive the onslaught;  
Ragnarr\[1\] gave me the Ship-Moon,  
With many tales marked on it.

\[1. See page 161.\]

{p. 191}

Battle is called Storm of Odin, as is recorded above; so sang
Víga-Glúmr:

I cleared my way aforetime  
Like earls to lands; the word went  
Of this among the Storm-Staves,  
The men of Vidrir's Sword-Wand.

Here battle is called Storm of Vidrir, and the sword is the Wand of
Battle; men are Staves of the Sword. Here, then, both battle and weapons
are used to make metaphors for man. It is called 'inlaying,' when one
writes thus.

"The shield is the Land of Weapons, and weapons are Hail or Rain of that
land, if one employs figures of later coinage.

L. "How should the ship be periphrased? Call it Horse or Deer or
Snowshoe of the Sea-King, or of Ship's Rigging, or of Storm. Steed of
the Billow, as Hornklofi sang:

The Counsel-Stern Destroyer  
Of the pale Steed of the Billow  
When full young let the ships' prows  
Press on the sea at flood-tide.

Geitir's Steed, as Erringar-Steinn sang:

But though to the skald all people  
This strife from the south are telling,  
We shall yet load Geitir's Sea-Steed  
With stone; we voyage gladly.

{p. 192}

Sveidi's Reindeer:

O Son of Sveinn strife-valiant,  
Thou comest with Sveidi's Reindeer,  
Long of seam, on the Seat of Sölsi;  
The Sound-Deer from land glided.

So sang Hallvardr. Here the ship is also called Deer of the Sound; and
the Sea is called Sölsi's Seat.

Thus sang Thórdr Sjáreksson:

The swift Steed of the Gunwale  
Around Sigg veered from northward,  
The gust shoved Gylfi's Stream's Mirth,  
The Gull's Wake-Horse, to southward  
Of Aumar, laying fleetly  
Both Körmt and Agdir's coastline  
Along the stern; by Listi  
The Leek's Steed lightly bounded.

Here the ship is called Steed of the Gunwale; and the sea is Gylfi's
Land; the sea is also called Gull's Wake. The ship is called Horse, and
further, Horse of the Leek: for 'leek' means 'mast.'

And again, as Markús sang:

The Stream's Winterling waded  
Stoutly the Firth-Snake's Snow-Heaps;  
The Tusker of the Mast-Head  
Leaped o'er the Whale's spurned House-Tops;  
The Bear of the Flood strode forward  
On the ancient paths of sea-ships;

{p. 193}

The Stay's Bear, shower-breasting.  
Broke the Reef's splashing Fetter.

Here the ship is called Winterling of the Stream: a bear cub is called a
Winterling; and a bear is called Tusker; the Bear of the Stay is a ship.

The ship is also called Reindeer, and so Hallvardr sang, as we have
written before; and Hart, as King Haraldr Sigurdarson sang:

By Sicily then widely  
The Seam cut: we were stately;  
The Sea-Hart glided swiftly  
As we hoped beneath the heroes.

And Elk, as Einarr sang:

The ring's mild Peace-Dispenser,  
The princely hero, may not  
Long bide with thee, if something  
Aid not; we boune the Flood's Elk.

And Otter, as Máni sang:

What, laggard carle with gray cheeks,  
Canst do among keen warriors  
On the Otter of the Sea-Waves?  
For thy strength is ebbing from thee.

Wolf, as Refr sang:

And the Hoard-Diminisher hearkened  
To Thorsteinn; true my heart is

{p. 194}

To the Lord of the Wolf of Billows  
In the baleful Wrath-Wand's conflict.

And Ox also. The ship is called Snowshoe, or Wagon, or Wain. Thus sang
Eyjólfr the Valiant Skald:

Late in the day the young Earl  
In the Snowshoe of Landless Waters  
Fared with equal following  
To meet the fearless chieftain.

Thus sang Styrkárr Oddason:

Högni's host drove the Wagons  
Of Rollers o'er Heiti's snow-Heaps,  
Angrily pursuing  
The great Giver of Flood-Embers.

And as Thorbjörn sang:

The Freighter of Wave-Crests' Sea-Wain  
Was in the font of christening,  
Hoard-Scatterer, who was given  
The White Christ's highest favor.

LI\. "How should one periphrase Christ? Thus: by calling Him Fashioner
of Heaven and Earth, of Angels, and of the Sun; Governor of the World
and of the Heavenly Kingdom and of Jerusalem and Jordan and the Land of
the Greeks; Counsellor of the Apostles and of the Saints. Ancient skalds
have written of Him in metaphors of Urdr's Well and Rome; as Eilífr
Gudrúnarson sang:

{p. 195}

So has Rome's Mighty Ruler  
In the Rocky Realms confirmèd  
His power; they say He sitteth  
South, at the Well of Urdr.

Thus sang Skapti Thóroddssen:

The King of Monks is greatest  
Of might, for God all governs;  
Christ's power wrought this earth all,  
And raised the Hall of Rome.

King of the Heavens, as Markús sang:

The King of the Wind-House fashioned  
Earth, sky, and faithful peoples;  
Christ, sole Prince of Mortals,  
Hath power o'er all that liveth.

Thus sang Eilífr Kúlnasveinn:

The Host of the beaming World's Roof  
And the Band of Illustrious bow down  
To the Holy Cross; than all glory  
Else the Sole Sun's King is brighter.

Son of Mary, as Eilífr sang further:

The bright Host of Heaven boweth  
To Mary's Bairn: He winneth,  
The Gentle Prince, of glory  
The true might, God and man both.

{p. 196}

King of Angels, as Eilífr sang again:

The goodly might of God's friend  
Is better than men guess of;  
Yet the Gracious King of Angels  
Is dearer than all, and holier.

King of Jordan, as Sigvatr sang:

Four angels the King of Jordan  
Sent long ago through aether  
To earthward; and the stream washed  
The holy head of the World's Lord.

King of Greeks, as Arnórr sang:

I have lodged for the hero's ashes  
Prayers with the Lordly Warder  
Of Greeks and men of Gardar:  
Thus I pay my Prince for good gifts.

Thus sang Eilífr Kúlnasveinn:

The Glory of Heaven praises  
Man's Prince: He is King of all things.

Here he called Christ, first, King of Men, and again, King of All.
Eínarr Skúlason sang:

He who compasseth, Bright in Mercy,  
All the world, and gently careth  
For all, caused the realm of Heaven  
To ope for the valiant ruler.

{p. 197}

LII\. "There the metaphors coincide; and he who interprets the language
of poesy learns to distinguish which king is meant; for it is correct to
call the Emperor of Constantinople King of Greeks, and similarly to call
the king who rules over the land of Jerusalem King of Jerusalem, and
also to call the Emperor of Rome King of Rome, and to call him King of
Angles' who governs England. But that periphrasis which was cited but
now, which called Christ King of Men, may be had by, every king. It is
proper to periphrase all kings by calling them Land-Rulers, or
Land-Warders, or Land-Attackers, or Leader of Henchmen, or Warder of the
People.

Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:

Who filled the ravens  
From life was reft  
By the Earth-Rulers  
At Ögló.\[1\]

And as Glúmr Geirason sang:

The Prince beneath the helmet  
Reddened the sword hone-hollowed  
On the Geats: there the Land-Warder  
Was found in the grinding spear-din.

As Thjódólfr sang:

'T is my wish that the glorious Leader  
Of Henchmen, the Glad-hearted,  
Should leave his sons the heritage  
And the sod of his fair freehold.

\[1. The reverse of Gregory's pun: "Non Angli sed angeli."

2\. See page 98.\]

{p. 198}

As Einarr sang:

The valiant-souled Earth-Warder  
On his stern head the helm bears;  
The bard before heroes telleth  
The fame of the King of Hördland.

It is right also to call him King of Kings, under whom are tributary
kings. An emperor is highest of kings, and next under him is that king
who reigns over a nation; and each of these is equal to the other in the
periphrases made of them in poesy. Next to them are those men who are
called earls or tributary kings: and they are equal in periphrasis with
a king, save that one may not term them kings of nations. And thus sang
Arnórr Earl's Skald concerning Earl Thorfinnr:

Let the men hear how the Earl's King,  
Hardy of mind, the sea sought:  
The overwhelming Ruler  
Failed not to thwart the ocean.

Next to these in the figures of poesy are those men who are called
chiefs: one may periphrase them as one might a king or an earl, calling
them Dispensers of Gold, Wealth Munificent, Men of the Standards, and
Captains of the Host, or Van-Leaders of the Array or of Battle; since
each king of a nation, who rules over many lands, appoints tributary
kings and earls in joint authority with himself, to administer the laws
of the land and defend it from attack in those parts which lie far
removed from the king. And in those parts they shall be equal with the
king's self in giving

{p. 199}

judgment and meting punishment. Now there are many districts in one
land; and it is the practice of kings to appoint justiciars over as many
districts as one chooses to give into their hands. These justiciars are
called chiefs or landed men in the Danish tongue, reeves in Saxony, and
barons in England. They are also to be righteous judges and faithful
warriors over the land which is entrusted to them for governance. If the
king is not near, then a standard shall be borne before them in battle;
and then they are quite as lawful war-captains as kings or earls.

"Next under them are those men who are called franklins: they are those
freeholders who are of honorable kindred, and possessed of full rights.
One may periphrase them by calling them Wealth-Givers, and Protectors,
and Reconcilers of Men; headmen also may have these titles.

"Kings and earls have as their following the men called henchmen and
house-carles; landed-men also have in their service those who are called
henchmen in Denmark and Sweden, and house-carles in Norway, and these
men swear oaths of service to them, even as henchmen do to kings. The
house-carles of kings were often called henchmen in the old heathen
time.

Thus sang Thorvaldr Blending Skald:

Hail, King, swift in the onset!  
And thy sturdy house-carles with thee!  
In their mouths men have my verses,  
Made for a song of praising.

King Haraldr Sigurdarson composed this:

The man full mighty waiteth  
The filling of the King's seat;

{p. 200}

Oft, I find, to the Earl's heels  
Throngs my host of house-carles.

Henchmen and house-carles may be periphrased by calling them
House-Guard, or Wage-Band, or Men of Honor: thus sang Sigvatr:

I learned the Warrior's Wage-Band  
On the water fought that battle  
Newly: 't is not the smallest  
Snow-shower of Shields I tell of.

And thus also:

When on the Steed of Cables  
The clashing steel was meeting,  
'T was not as when a maid bears  
The Chief's mead to the Honor-Winners.

The service-fee which headmen give is called wages and gifts; thus sang
Óttarr the Swarthy:

I needs must use the Breaker  
Of the Battle-Glow of good men;  
Here is the watch war-doughty  
Of the Wise King assembled.\[1\]

Earls and chiefs and henchmen are periphrased by calling them
Counsellors or Speech-Friends or Seat-Mates of the King, as Hallfredr
sang:

\[1. See page 176.\]

{p. 201}

The Counsellor battle-mighty  
Of the Prince, whom boldness pleases,  
Lets the feud-fiery weeds of Högni,  
Hammer-beaten, clash upon him.

As Snaebjörn sang:

The Speech-Friend of Kings letteth  
The long-hulled steer-rope's Race-Horse  
Steady the swordlike steel beak  
Of the ship against the stern wave.

Thus sang Arnórr:

My young sons do bear for my sake  
Grave sorrow for the slaughter  
Of the Earl, destroyed by murder,  
The Bench-Mate of our Monarch.

King's Counsel-Friend, as Hallfredr sang:

In council 't was determined  
That the King's Friend, wise in counsel,  
Should wed the Land, sole Daughter  
Of Ónarr, greenly wooded.\[1\]

One should periphrase men by their kindred; as Kormákr sang:

Let the son of Haraldr's true friend  
Give ear, and hearken to me:  
I raise my song, the Yeast-Stream  
Of Sýr's snow-covered Monsters.

\[1. See page 136.\]

{p. 202}

He called the Earl True Friend of the King, and Hákon, Son of Earl
Sigurdr. And Thjódólfr sang thus concerning Haraldr:

About Ólafr's sire  
Waxed the steel-knife-storm's ire,  
That of wightness each deed  
Is worthy fame's meed.

And again:

Jarizleifr could espy  
Where the king passed by:  
The brave, sainted lord's kin  
Stoutly praise did win.

And again he sang:

Breath-bereft is he  
Who o'er all bore the gree,--  
Of chiefs kinsman mild,  
Haraldr's brother's child.

Arnórr also sang thus in *Rögnvaldr's Song of Praise*:

Heiti's war-good kinsman  
Made wedlock-kindred with me:  
The earl's strong tie of marriage  
Made honor to us rendered.

And again, concerning Earl Thorfinnr, he sang:

The thin-made swords bit keenly  
Old Rögnvaldr's kin, to southward

{p. 203}

Of Man, where rushed the strong hosts  
Under the sheltering shield-rims.

And he sang further:

O God, guard the glorious  
Kin-Betterer of great Turf-Einarr  
From harm; I pray, show mercy  
To him whom faithful chiefs love.

And Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

The House-Prop of the Kindred  
Of Hilditönn shall not lack  
Hardihood more munificent;  
I am bound to maintain praises.

LIII\. "How are the uninvolved terms of poesy made? By calling each
thing by its proper name. What are the simple terms for poesy? It is
called Poetry, Glorifying, Song, Laud, and Praise. Bragi the Old sang
this, when he was travelling through a forest late at evening: a troll
woman hailed him in verse, asking who passed:

'Trolls do call me  
Moon's . . .  
. . . of the giant,  
Storm-sun's (?) bale,  
Fellow-in-misery of the sibyl,  
Warder of the circled ring-earth,  
Wheel-devourer of the heaven.  
What is the troll but that?"

\[1. "Eru tröll-kenningar, sumar myrkar." Jónsson, p. 403.\]

{p. 204}

He answered thus:

'Skalds do call me  
Vidurr's Shape-Smith,  
Gautr's Gift-Finder,  
Bard not faulty,  
Yggr's Ale-Bearer,  
Song's Arrayer,  
Skilled Smith of Verse:  
What is the Skald but this?'

And as Kormákr sang:

I make more Glorifying  
By far o'er Hákon's great son:  
I pay him the song-atonement  
Of the gods. In his wain Thor sitteth.

And as Thórdr Kolbeinsson sang:

The Shield-Maple let many swift ships  
And merchant-craft, and speedy  
War-boats o'er the sea pour;  
The skald's ready Song of Laud waxed.

Laud, as Úlfr Uggason sang:

Now the stream to the sea cometh;  
But first the Laud I sang forth  
Of the Messenger of Sword-Rain:  
Thus I raise the praise of warriors.

Here poesy is called praise also.

{p. 205}  
LIV. "How are the gods named? They are called Fetters, as Eyjólfr the
Valiant Skald sang:

Eiríkr draws the lands beneath him  
At the pleasure of the Fetters,  
And fashions the Spear-Battle.

And Bonds, as Thjódólfr of Hvin sang:

The skilful God-Deceiver  
To the Bonds proved a stern sharer  
Of bones: the Helmet-Hooded  
Saw somewhat hindered seething.\[1\]

Powers, as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:

I say, the Mighty Powers  
Magnify Hákon's empire.

Jólnar,\[2\] as Eyvindr sang:

We have fashioned  
The Feast of Jólnar,  
The Prince's praise-song,  
Strong as a stone bridge.

Deities,\[3\] as Kormákr sang:

\[1. See page 130.

2\. This word, in the singular, is one of the names of Odin. I can find
no etymology for it.

3\. A rare and doubtful word. According to Cl.-Vig., the word occurs
only twice: *Yngl. S.*, ch. ii, and here. Cl.-Vig. holds that the word
probably meant *priests*: "The *díar* of the *Yngl. S.* were probably
analogous to the Icel. *godi*, from god (*deus*)" (p. 100).\]

{p. 206}

The Giver of Lands, who bindeth  
The sail to the top, with gold-lace  
Honors him who pours Deities' verse-mead;  
Odin wrought charms on Rindr.\[1\]

LV\. "These names of the heavens are recorded (but we have not found all
these terms in poems; and these skaldic terms, even as others, are not
meet for use in skaldic writing, methinks, unless one first find such
names in the works of Chief Skalds): Heaven, Hlýrnir, Heidthornir, Storm
Mímir, Long-Lying, Light-Farer, Driving, Topmost Sky, Wide-Fathom,
Vet-Mímir, Lightning, Destroyer, Wide-Blue. The solar planet is called
Sun, Glory, Ever-Glow, All-Bright, Sight, Fair Wheel, Healing Ray,
Dvalinn's Playmate, Elfin-Beam, Doubtful-Beam, Luminary. The lunar
planet is called Moon, Waxer, Waner, Year-Teller, Mock-Sun,
Fengari,\[2\] Glamour, Haster, Crescent, Glare.

LVI\. "Which are the simple terms for Earth? She is called Earth, as
Thjódólfr sang:

The hardy Point-Rain's Urger  
Oft caused the harsh sword-shower,  
Ere under him the broad Earth  
With battle he subjected.

Field, as Óttarr sang:

The Prince guards the Field:  
Few kings are so mighty;

\[1. See page 100.

2\. "Byzant. {Greek *fegga'ri*}; an {Greek *a?'p. leg.*}" (Cl.-Vig., p.
151).\]

{p. 207}

Óleifr fattens the eagle,  
Foremost is the Swedes' King.

Ground, as Hallvardr sang:

The broad Ground, 'neath the venom-cold Adder  
Bound, lies subject to the Warrior  
Of the Island-Fetter's heaped gold;  
The Hone-Land's Lord the hoard dispenseth.

Haudr,\[1\] as Einarr sang:

Brave heroes are defending  
The hard Haudr of famous princes  
With the sword; oft splits the helmet  
Before the furious edge-storm.

Land, as Thórdr Kolbeinsson sang:

The Land, after the battle,  
Was laid low from Veiga northward  
To Agdir south, or farther:  
Hard is song in conflict.

Fief, as Óttarr sang:

Thou, fierce War-Staff, maintainedst  
The Fief despite two Monarchs  
With heroes' kin. where the ravens  
Starved not; keen-hearted art thou.\[2\]

\[1. "Etymology not known" (Cl.-Vig., p. 241).

2\. See pages 180, 181.\]

{p. 208}

Hlödyn,\[1\] as Völu-Steinn sang:

I remember how murky earth yawned  
With graven mouth for the Sender  
Of the Gold-Words of the Giant  
Of the hard bones of Green Hlödyn.

Country, as Úlfr Uggason sang:

But the flashing-eyed stiff Edge-Rope  
Of the Earth stared past the gunwale  
At the Rowan-Tree of the Country  
Of Stone, the Giant-Tester.\[2\]

Fjörgyn,\[3\] as is said here:

I was faithful to the free Payer  
Of the stream-bed of Fjörgyn's Serpent;  
May honor be closely guarded  
By the Giver of the Giant's Stream-gold.

LVII\. "It is correct to periphrase blood or carrion in terms of the
beast which is called Strangler," by calling them his Meat and Drink; it
is not correct to express them in terms of other beasts. The Strangler
is also called Wolf.

As Thjódólfr sang:

Enough guesting to the Ravener  
Was given, when the Son of Sigurdr

\[1. A personification.

2\. See page 179.

3\. Cf. Goth. *fairguni* (= a mountain) and A.-S. *fyrgen*. A
personification: Fjörgynn is father of Frigg and of Jörd (Earth).

4\. *Vargr*; cf. A.-S. *wearg*, Ger. -würgen.\]

{p. 209}

Came from the North, the Wolf  
To lure from the wood to the wound.

Here he is called Ravener also.

Greedy One, as Egill sang:

The Greedy One gashed  
Grisly wounds, when plashed  
The red Point-Creek  
On the raven's beak.

Witch-Beast, as Einarr sang:

The Götha, cold with venom,  
With hot Wound-Gush was reddened;  
The Witch-Beast's warm drink, mingled  
With the water, in the sea poured.

She-Wolf, as Arnórr sang:

The She-Wolf's evil Kindred  
Swallowed the corpse, harm-swollen,  
When the green sea was turnèd  
To red, with gore commingled.

Strangler, as Illugi sang:

There was happiness for the Strangler  
When my lord pursued hosts full many;  
With the sword the Necklet-Minisher  
Pierced the swart Snake of the Forest.

{p. 210}

Thus sang Hallr:

He sated the Heath-Beasts' Hunger:  
The hoar howler in wounds gladdened;  
The king reddened the Wild One's mouth-hairs,--  
The Wolf went to drink of the wound.

And again, as Thórdr sang:

In blood Gjálp's Stud-Horse waded,  
The dusty pack got fullness  
Of the Greedy One's Wheat; the howler  
Enjoyed the Ravener's Gore-Drink.

The bear is called Wide-Stepper, Cub, Winterling, Ourse, Gib-Cat,
Tusker, Youngling, Roarer, Jölfudr,\[1\] Wilful-Sharp, She-Bear,
Horse-Chaser, Scratcher, Hungry One, Blómr,\[1\] Bustler. The hart is
called Módrödnir,\[2\] Dalarr,\[3\] Dalr,\[3\] Dáinn,\[4\] Dvalinn,\[4\]
Duneyrr,\[4\] Durathrór.\[4\] These are the names of horses enumerated
in the *Rhymes* of Thorgrímr:\[5\]

Hrafn\[6\] and Sleipnir,  
The famous horses;  
Valr\[7\] and Léttfeti;  
Tjaldari\[8\] a was there too;  
Gulltopr and Goti;\[9\]

Sheep: Ram, buck, ewe, lamb, wether.

Swine: Sow, she-pig, boar, hog, suckling.

LVIII\. "What are the names of the air and of the winds? Air is called
Yawning Void and Middle World, Bird-Abode, Wind-Abode. Wind is called
Storm, Breeze, Gale, Tempest, Gust, Blowing. Thus does one read in
*Alsvinnsmál*:

Wind 't is called among menfolk,  
And Waverer with the gods,--  
Neigher the great powers name it;  
Shrieker the giants,  
And Shouter elves call it;  
In Hel Clamorer 't is called.

The Wind is also called Blast.

LIX\. "Two are those birds which there is no need to periphrase

4\. Heir; cf. with 3.

5\. For these names and their meanings, see *Gylfag*., ch. xvi.\]

{p. 214}

or corpses; and then their names are terms of the eagle or the raven. As
Thjódólfr sang:

The Prince with Eagle's Barley  
Doth feed the bloody moor-fowl:  
The Hörd-King bears the sickle  
Of Odin to the gory Swan's crop;  
The Sater of the Vulture  
Of the Eagle's Sea of corpses  
Stakes each shoal to the southward  
Which he wards, with the spear-point.

These are names of the raven: Crow, Huginn,\[1\] Muninn,\[1\] Bold of
Mood, Yearly Flier, Year-Teller, Flesh-Boder.

Thus sang Einarr Tinkling-Scale:

With flesh the Host-Convoker  
Filled the feathered ravens:  
The raven, when spears were screaming,  
With the she-wolf's prey was sated.

Thus sang Einarr Skúlason:

He who gluts the Gull of Hatred,  
Our precious lord, could govern  
The sword; the hurtful raven  
Of Huginn's corpse-load eateth.

And as he sang further:

But the King's heart swelleth,  
His spirit flushed with battle,

\[1. For the meaning of these names (which are those of Odin's Ravens),
see *Gylfag*., ch. xxxviii.\]

{p. 215}

Where heroes shrink; dark Muninn  
Drinks blood from out the wounds.

As Víga-Glúmr sang:

When stood the shielded Maidens  
Of the gory sword, strife-eager,  
On the isle; the Bold of Mood then  
Received the meat of wound-blood.

As Skúli Thorsteinsson sang:

Not the hindmost in the hundred  
Might Hlökk of horns have seen me,  
Where to the Yearly Flier  
I fed the wounds full grievous.

The erne is called Eagle, Old One, Storm-Shearer, Inciter, Soarer,
Wound-Shearer, Cock. As Einarr sang:

With blood the lips he reddened  
Of the black steed of Járnsaxa;  
With steel Erne's meat was furnished:  
The Eagle slit the Wolf's Bait.

As Ottarr sang:

The Erne swills corpse-drink,  
The She-wolf is sated,  
The Eagle there feedeth,  
Oft the wolf his fangs reddens.

{p. 216}

As Thjódólfr sang:

The Spoiler of the Lady  
Swiftly flew with tumult  
To meet the high God-Rulers,  
Long hence, in Old One's plumage.\[1\]

And as stands here:

With skill will I rehearse  
Of the Storm-Shearer my verse.

And again as Skúli sang:

Early and late with sobbing  
I wake, where well is sated  
The hawk of the Cock's blood-ocean:  
Then the bard heareth good tidings.

LX\. "What are the names of the Sea? It is called Ocean, Main, Wintry,
Lee, Deep, Way, Weir, Salt, Lake, Furtherer. As Arnórr sang, and as we
have written above:

Let men hear how the Earls' King,  
Hardy of mind, the Sea sought;  
The overwhelming Ruler  
Failed not to resist the Main.\[2\]

Here it is named Sea, and Main also.

"Ocean, as Hornklofi sang:

When the man-scathing Meeter  
Of the Mansion of the Rock-Reefs

\[1. See Page 130.

2\. See page 198.\]

{p. 217}

Thrust the Forecastle-Adder  
And the skiff out on the Ocean.

In the following verse it is called Lake as well: thus sang Einarr:

The Lake doth bathe the vessel,  
Where the sea 'gainst each side beateth,  
And the bright wind-vanes rattle;  
The surf washes the Flood-Steeds.

Here it is called Flood also. Thus sang Refr, as was said before:

Wintry One's\[1\] wet-cold Spae-Wife  
Wiles the Bear of Twisted Cables  
Oft into Ægir's wide jaws,  
Where the angry billow breaketh.\[2\]

Deep, as Hallvardr sang:

The Sword-Shaker bids be pointed  
The prow of the hardy ship-steed  
Westward in the girdle  
Of all lands, the Watery Deep.

Way, as here:

On our course from land we glided;  
On the Way to the coast of Finland:  
I see from the Ship's Road, eastward,  
The fells with radiance gleaming.

Weir, as Egill sang:

\[1. *Gymir*. See Gering, *Die Edda*, p. 53, note 2.

2\. See page 139.\]

{p. 218}

I sailed o'er the Weir  
To the West: I bear  
Odin's Heart-Sea.  
So it stands with me.

Ocean, as Einarr sang:

Many a day the cold Ocean  
Washes the swarthy deck-planks  
'Neath the gracious Prince; and Snow-Storm  
Furrows Mona's Girdle.

Salt, as Arnórr sang:

The hardy King the Salt plowed  
From the east with hull ice-laden:  
Brown tempests tossed the Lessener  
Of Surf-Gold toward Sigtún.

Furtherer, as Bölverkr sang:

Thou didst summon from fair Norway  
A levy the next season,  
With Din-Surf's ships the Furtherer  
Didst shear; o'er decks the sea poured.  
Here the sea is called Din-Surf also.

Wide One, as Refr sang:

To its breast the Stay's steed taketh  
The Home of Planks, beak-furrowed,  
And tosses the Wide One over  
The hard side; the wood suffers.

{p. 219}

Dusky One, as Njáll of the Burning sang:

We sixteen pumped, my Lady,  
In four oar-rooms, but the surge waxed:  
The Dusky One beat over  
The hull of the driven sea-ship.

These are other names for the Sea, such as it is proper to use in
periphrasing ships or gold.

"Rán, it is said, was Ægir's wife, even as is written here:

To the sky shot up the Deep's Gledes,  
With fearful might the sea surged:  
Methinks our stems the clouds cut,--  
Rán's Road to the moon soared upward.

The daughters of Ægir and Rán are nine, and their names are recorded
before: Himinglæva,\[1\] Dúfa,\[2\] Blódughadda,\[3\] Hefring,\[4\]
Udr,\[5\] Hrönn,\[6\] Bylgja,\[7\] Dröfn,\[8\] Kólga.\[9\] Einarr
Skúlason recorded the names of six of them in this stanza, beginning:

Himinglæva sternly stirreth,  
And fiercely, the sea's wailing.

Welling Wave,\[10\] as Valgardr sang:

Foam rested in the Sea's bed:  
Swollen with wind, the deep played,

\[1. That through which one can see the heaven (Jónsson).

2\. The Pitching One (Jónsson).

3 Bloody-Hair.

4 Riser.

5\. Frothing Wave.

6\. Welling Wave.

7\. Billow.

8\. Foam-Fleck.

9\. Poetical term for Wave. "The Cool One" (Jónsson).

10\. In the following stanzas, for the sake of consistency, I have been
obliged to translate the names, since they are employed in the stanzas
as common nouns, {footnote p. 220} rather than as proper names. It is
beyond my ability to translate *Himinglæva* briefly.\]

{p. 220}

And the Welling Waves were washing  
The awful heads of the war-ships.

Billow, as Ottarr the Swarthy sang:

Ye shear with shaven rudder  
Billows moisty-deep; the broad sheet,  
Which girls spun, on the mast-head  
With the Roller's Reindeer sported.

Foam-Fleck, as Ormr sang:

The hawk-like, heedful Lady  
Has every virtue: Lofn  
Of the Foam-Fleck's flame-gold, faithful  
As a friend, all faults renounceth.

Wave-Borne, as Thorleikr the Fair sang:

The sea walls, and the Wave-Borne  
Bears bright froth o'er the red wood,  
Where gapes the Roller's Brown Ox,  
With mouth gold-ornamented.

Shoal, as Einarr sang:

Nor met the Forward-Minded,  
Where the fierce sea on our friends falls;  
I think the Shoal becalmed not  
The Ship, Wood of the Waters.

Fullness, as Refr sang:

{p. 221}

Downward the Fells of Fullness  
Fall on the Bear of Tackle:  
Now forward Winterling, stirreth,  
The ship, on Glammi's sea-path.

Comber,\[1\] as here:

The Comber fell headlong o'er me;  
The Main called me home unto it:  
I accepted not the Sea's bidding.

Breaker, as Óttarr sang:

In burst the ship-sides thin;  
Rushed the Breaker downward; flushed  
Stood the wind, bane of the wood;  
Men endured wild tempest then.

Wave, as Bragi sang:

The Giver of the Wave's Coals,  
Who cut Thor's slender tackle,  
The Line of the Land of Sea-Mews,  
Loved not to fight the wroth sea.

Sound, as Einarr sang:

I sheared the Sound  
From Hrund south-bound;  
My hand was gold-wound  
When the Giver I found.

\[1. So Cl.-Vig. Literally, the word means ominous, foreboder.\]

{p. 222}

Fjord, as Einarr sang:

Next I see a serpent  
Carved well on the splendid ale-horn:  
Let the Fjord-Fire's Dispenser  
Learn how for that I pay him.

Wetness, as Markús sang:

I'll not lampoon the Chatterer,  
Lord of the fearful sword-blade,  
Who squanders the Sun of Wetness:  
Ill is he who spoileth verses.

LXI\. "What are the names of fire? Even as is written here:

Not seldom does the fire blaze  
Which Magnús sets: the stalwart  
Ruler burns habitations:  
Houses blow reek before him.

Glow, as Valgardr sang:

Fierce Glow, with red-hot embers,  
Swiftly from the soot flared,  
Straight o'er the tottering dwellings  
Stood up the dense smoke-columns.

Bale, as here:

Haki was burned on Bale,  
Where the sea's broad wake weltered.

{p. 223}

Gledes, as Grani sang:

I think the Gledes diminished . . .  
Glammi's tracks; thus the king kindled.

Embers, as Atli sang:

With blood the axe is reddened,  
Embers wax, burn many houses,  
Halls stand aglow; now rages  
The Gem; good men are falling.

Here fire is called Gem also.

Vapor, as here:

Half-built, by the Nid's side  
Burn the All-Ruler's dwellings;  
I think fire razed the hall's pride:  
Vapor shot rime on the people.

Hot Ashes, as Arnórr sang:

The Isle-Danes' wrathful Harmer  
With the Raumar spared not hard counsel:  
Hot Ashes made them calmer;  
The Heinir's threatening words hushed.

Flames, as Einarr sang:

Flame soon was alight,  
And swiftly took flight  
All Hísing's host:  
The fight they lost.

{p. 224}

Flare, as Valgardr sang:

The sturdy king's bright Flare soared  
Above the castle's bulwark;  
The vikings burst in grimly:  
Grief on the maid descended.

Lowe, as Haldórr sang:

There did ye share their jewels,  
While o'er the host the Shield's Lowe,  
The sword, shrieked fiercely: never  
Wert thou spoiled of conquest.

LXII\. "These are time-names: Cycle, Days of Yore, Generation,
Lang-Syne, Year, Season, Winter, Summer, Spring, Autumn, Month, Week,
Day, Night, Morning, Eve, Twilight, Early, Soon, Late, Betimes, Day
before Yesterday, Yester Eve, Yesterday, To-morrow, Hour, Moment. These
are more names of Night in *Alsvinnsmál*:

Night 't is called among men,  
And among the gods, Mist-Time;  
Hooded Hour the Holy Powers know it;  
Sorrowless the giants,  
And elves name it Sleep-joy;  
The dwarves call it Dream-Weaver.

\["It is autumn from the equinox till the time when the sun sets three
hours and a half after noon; then winter endures till the equinox; then
it is spring till the moving-days;\[1\] then

\[1. In May.\]

{p. 225}

summer till the equinox. The month next before winter is called
Harvest-Month; the first in winter is the Month of Cattle-Slaughter;
then Freezing Month, then Rain-Month, then the Month of Winter's Wane,
then Gói;\[1\] then Single Month, then Cuckoo-Month and Seed-Time, then
Egg-time and Lamb-Weaning-Time; then come Sun-Month and Pasture Month,
then Haying-Season; then Reaping Month.\]\[2\]

LXIII\. "What are the simple terms for men? Each, in himself, is Man;
the first and highest name by which man is called is Emperor; next to
that, King; the next thereto, Earl: these three men possess in common
all the following titles: All-Ruler, as this song showeth:

I know all All-Rulers  
East and south, o'er the Ships' seat  
Sveinn's son in proof is better  
Than any other War-Prince.

Here he is called War-Prince also; for this reason he is called
All-Ruler, that he is sole Ruler of all his realm.

Host-Arrayer, as Gizurr sang:

The Host-Arrayer feedeth  
The wolf and the raven in folk-mote;  
Óláfr gladdens, in Skögul's sharp showers  
Of battle, the geese of Odin.

\[1. I cannot find the meaning of this word.

2\. "This passage, which U lacks, is clearly a later addition." Jónsson,
Copenhagen ed. (1900), p. 138, footnote.\]

{p. 226}

"A King is called Host-Arrayer because he divides his war-host into
companies.

Leader, as Ottarr the Swarthy sang:

The Leader taketh  
Odin's loved Wife,  
The lordless land;  
His a warrior's life.

Lord or Lording, as Arnórr sang:

The Lord of Hjaltland, highest  
Of heroes, gained the victory  
In every thunderous sword-clash:  
The bard will extol his glory.

An earl is called Host-Duke, and a king also is so termed, forasmuch as
he leads his host to battle. Thus sang Thjódólfr:

He who put to shame the Host-Duke  
Thrust out the eyes of prisoners,--  
He who speeds the sacrifices;  
In song I chant his praises.

Signor, or Señor, as Sigvatr sang:

O Norway's gracious Signor,  
Grant the wretched, as the happy,  
May now enjoy thy wise laws;  
Give greatly, hold thy word!

Munificent One, as Markús sang:

{p. 227}

The Munificent Prince brought fire's destruction  
O'er the base people; to the pirates  
Death was fated: Thief-Compeller,  
South at Jóm highest flame-glow kindle!

Illustrious One, as Hallvardr sang:

No Illustrious One nearer  
Under Earth's Hazel liveth  
Than thou, O Monks' Upholder:  
The Gold-Minisher Danes protecteth.

Land-Driver, as Thjódólfr sang:

The guileless Land-Driver sprinkles  
Kraki's gleaming barley,

as was written before;\[1\] he is called so because he drives his host
about the lands of other kings, or drives a host out of his own land.

LXIV\. "There was a king named Hálfdan the Old, who was most famous of
all kings. He made a great sacrificial feast at mid-winter, and
sacrificed to this end, that he might live three hundred years in his
kingdom; but he received these answers: he should not live more than the
full life of a man, but for three hundred years there should be no woman
and no man in his line who was not of great repute. He was a great
warrior, and went on forays far and wide in the Eastern Regions:\[2\]
there he slew in single combat the king who was called Sigtryggr. Then
he took in

\[1. See Page. 173.

2\. That is, in the lands bordering the Baltic.\]

{p. 228}

marriage that woman named Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymundr of
Hólmgardr:\[1\] they had eighteen sons, nine born at one birth. These
were their names: the first, Thengill,\[2\] who was called
Manna-Thengill;\[2\] the second, Ræsir;\[3\] the third, Gramr;\[3\] the
fourth, Gylfi;\[3\] the fifth, Hilmir;\[3\] the sixth, Jöfurr;\[3\] the
seventh, Tyggi;\[3\] the eighth, Skyli\[3\] or Skúli;\[3\] the ninth,
Harri\[3\] or Herra.\[3\] These nine brothers became so famous in
foraying that, in all records since, their names are used as titles of
rank, even as the name of King or that of Earl. They had no children,
and all fell in battle. Thus sang Ottarr the Swarthy:

In his youth stalwart Thengill  
Was swift and staunch in battle:  
I pray his line endureth;  
O'er all men I esteem him.

Thus sang Markus:

The Ræsir let the Rhine's Sun shimmer  
From the reddened Skull's ship on the Sea-Fells.

Thus sang Egill:

The Gramr the hood hath lifted  
From the hair-fenced brows of the Singer.

Thus sang Eyvindr:

He played with the land-folk  
Who should have defended;

\[1. Russia.

2\. This word means Prince or King; *Manna-Thengill* = Prince of Men.

3\. All of these words are poetic names for a Prince or King.\]

{p. 229}

Gylfi the gladsome  
Stood 'neath the gold helmet.

Thus sang Glúmr Geirason:

Hilmir beneath the helmet  
Reddened the sword hone-hollowed.\[1\]

Thus sang Óttarr the Swarthy:

Let Jöfurr hear the beginning  
Of his laud: all the king's praises  
Shall be maintained, and justly  
Let him mark my praise-song's measures.

As Stúfr sang:

The glory-ardent Tyggi  
South before Niz with two hands  
Beat down the band of heroes:  
Glad beneath their shields the host went.

Thus sang Hallfredr:

From Skyli I am parted:  
This age of swords hath caused it.  
'T is greatest of all self-mockings  
To hope that the king's guard cometh.

Thus sang Markús:

I bid the hawklike Danish Harri  
Hark to my cunning web of praises.

\[1. See page 197\]

{p. 230}

"Hálfdan and his wife had nine other sons also; these were Hildir, from
whom the Hildings are come; Nefir, from whom the Niflungs sprang; Audi,
from whom the Ödlungs are come; Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are
descended; Dagr, from whom come the Döglings; Bragi, from whom the
Bragnings are sprung (that is the race of Hálfdan the Munificent);
Budli, from whom the Budlungs are come (from the house of the Budlungs
Atli and Brynhildr descended); the eighth was Lofdi, who was a great
war-king (that host who were called Lofdar followed him; his kindred are
called Lofdungs, whence sprang Eylimi, Sigurdr Fáfnisbani's mother's
sire); the ninth, Sigarr, whence come the Siklings: that is the house of
Siggeirr, who was son-in-law of Völsungr,--and the house of Sigarr, who
hanged Hagbardr. From the race of Hildings sprang Haraldr the
Red-Bearded, mother's father of Hálfdan the Swarthy. Of the Niflung's
house was Gjúki; of the house of Ödlings, Kjárr; of the house of the
Ylfings was Eiríkr the Wise in Speech. These also are illustrious royal
houses: from Yngvi, the Ynglings are descended; from Skjöldr in Denmark,
the Skjöldungs are come; from Völsungr in the land of Franks, those who
are called Völsungs. One war-king was named Skelfir; and his house is
called the House of Skilfings: his kindred is in the Eastern Region.

"These houses which were named but now have been used in skaldship for
titles of rank. Even as Einarr sang:

I learned that the Hildings sallied  
To hold the Spear-Assembly  
On the Gray Isle; the broad shields,  
Green lindens, burst in sunder.

{p. 231}

As Grant sang:

The Dögling to eagle's kindred  
For drink gave Danish blood.

As Gamli Gnævadar-Skald sang:

Not long since, the young Ödling  
With ship's deck and with sword-blade  
Joined battle, waging fiercely  
Of points the bitter tempest.

As Jórunn sang:

The Bragning bade the weapons  
Be dyed in blood of vile folk;  
The people endured his anger:  
Houses bowed before red embers.

Thus sang Einarr:

The Budlung's blade sheared,  
Blood on darts was smeared;  
The storm-cloud of Hildr  
At Whitby spilled.

Thus sang Arnorr:

The Kin of Siklings inureth  
To the waves the ships sea-tossing;  
With blood he dyes the warships  
Within: 't is the weal of ravens.

{p. 232}

As Thjódólfr sang:

Thus the doughty Sikling ended  
His life; in dire straits were we:  
The glorious Lofdung waited  
Bravely surcease of living.

The folk who were called Lofdar followed King Lofdi.

As Arnórr sang:

Chief, another Skjöldung higher  
Than thou shall ne'er be born 'neath sun's light.

Völsung, as Thorkell Hamar-Skald sang:

The Kin of Völsungs  
Gave counsel to send me  
The gold-decked weapon  
O'er the cool waters.

Yngling, as Ottarr the Swarthy sang:

In the East no mighty Yngling  
To earth fell, ere o'ertook thee  
He who subjected to him  
The Sea-isles from the westward.

Yngvi: that too is a king's title, as Markús sang:

The age shall hear the praise of Eiríkr:  
None in the world a prince hath known of  
Lordlier; thou holdest, Yngvi,  
The Seat of Kings with long-kept glory.

{p. 233}

Skilfing, as Valgardr sang:

The Skilfing kept a great host  
Southward in the broad lands,  
Where the swift ships shivered:  
Sicily soon was desolated.

Signor, as Sigvatr sang:

O Norway's gracious Signor,  
Let the poor enjoy; give greatly.\[1\]

LXV\. "Skalds are called bards; and in skaldship it is correct to call
any man so whom one will. Those men who served King Hálfr were called
Champions.\[2\] and from their name warriors are called champions; and
it is correct to call all men so. In skaldship men are called Lofdar
also, as is written above.\[3\] Those men were called Skatnar\[4\] who
served the king named Skati the Munificent: from his name every one who
is munificent is called Skati. They who followed Bragi the Old were
called Bragnar.\[5\] They who assess the transactions of men are called
taxers. Fyrdar\[6\] and Firar\[7\] are they called who defend the land.
Vikings and fleet-men form a ship-army. They who followed King Beimuni
were called Beimar.\[8\] Captains of companies are called Grooms, even
as he is called who carries home a bride. The Goths are named after that
king who was called Goti, from whom Gotland is named: he was so called
after Odin's name, derived from the name *Gautr*,

\[1. See page 216.

2\. *Rekkar*.

3\. See page 232.

4\. Plural of *Skati* = lordly, towering.

5\. Heroes.

8\. Heroes, Men.\]

{p. 234}

for Gautland or Gotland was named after Odin's name, and Sweden from the
name of Svidurr, which is also a title of Odin's. At that time all the
mainland which he possessed was called Reid-Gotaland, and all the
islands, Ey-Gotaland: that is now called the Realm of Danes or of
Swedes.

"Young men not householders are called Drengs, while they are acquiring
wealth and glory: sea-faring Drengs are they who voyage from land to
land; King's Drengs are they who serve rulers. They also are Drengs who
serve wealthy men or franklins; valiant and ambitious men are called
Drengs. Warriors are also called Champions and Troops: these are
soldiers. Freeholders are called Thanes and Yeomen; those men who go
about reconciling men are called Day-Men. These men are they who are
called Champions, Kemps, Men of War, Brave Men, Valiant Men, Hardy Men,

Weakling, Qualmish, Caitiff, Scamp, Vile One, Dog, Lout, Feeble One,
Paltry' One, Imbecile, Bungler, Son of Wretchedness.

"A good man of his hands is called Munificent, Illustrious, Towerer,
Mighty Towerer, Towering Gold-Giver, Prince of Men, Wealthy One,
Prosperous, Heaper-Up of Riches, Mighty Man, Chieftain. In contrast to
these are they who are called Niggard, Miser, Calculator, Wretched One,
Wealth-Hiding, Gift-Tardy One. A man wise in Counsel is called Wielder
of Counsel. A witless man is called Clown, Oaf, Gander, Dupe, Boor,
Idiot, Dolt, Fool, Madman, Maniac, Moon-Struck. One who thinks much of

Sheath-Cleaner, Fawner, Brawler, Good-for-Naught, Worthless One.
Common-folk are called Country-folk or People. A thrall is called

LXVI\. "Each one singly is called man; 't is twain if they are two;
three are a thorp; four are a group; a band is five men; if there are
six, it is a squad; seven complete a crew; eight men make a panel; nine
are 'good fellows;' ten are a gang; eleven form an embassy; it is a
dozen if twelve go together; thirteen. are a crowd; fourteen are an
expedition; it is a gathering, when fifteen meet; sixteen make a

are a posse; thirty are a squadron; forty, a community; fifty are a
shire; sixty are an assembly; seventy are a line;\[1\] eighty are a
people; one hundred is a host.

LXVII\. "Beside these there are those terms which men prefix to the
names of men: we call such terms epithets of possession,\[2\] or true
terms, or surnames. It is an epithet of possession when one names a
thing by its true name, and calls him whom one desires to periphrase
Owner of that thing; or Father or Grandfather of that which was named;
Grandsire is a third epithet. Moreover, a son is also called Heir,
Heritor, Bairn, Child and Boy, Inheritor. A blood-kinsman is called
Brother, Twin, Germane, Consanguine; a relation is also called Nephew,
Kinsman, Kin,

Bench-Fellow, Fondling, Seat-Mate; bench-fellow also means Cabin-Mate. A
foe is called Adversary, Shooter Against One, Hater, Attacker, Scather,
Slayer, Hard Presser, Pursuer, Overbearer.

"These terms we call epithets of possession; and so also if a man is
known by his dwelling or his ship, which has a name of its own, or by
his estate, when a name of its own is given to it.

"This we call true terms: to call a man Wise Man, Man of Thought, Wise
in Speech, Sage in Counsel, Wealth Munificent, Not Slack, Endower,
Illustrious One; these are surnames.

LXVIII\. "These are simple terms for women in skald ship: Wife and Bride
and Matron are those women who are given to a man. Those who walk in
pomp and fine array are called Dame and Lady. They who are witty of
speech are called Women of Wisdom.\[1\] They who are gentle are called
Girls; they who are of high countenance are called Proud and Haughty
Ones. She who is of noble mind is called Gentlewoman;\[2\] she who is
richest, Lady. She who is bashful, as young -maids are, or those women
who are modest, is called Lass. The woman whose husband has departed
from the land is called Stay-at-Home.

\[1. *Snót* (plural, *Snótir*) = a gentlewoman. Cf. *Snotr* = wise. A
popular etymology.

2\. Literally = Plowshare. (See Cl.-Vig, p. 498.)\]

{p. 237}

That woman whose husband is slain is called War-Widow: Widow is the term
for her whose husband has died of sick ness. Maid means, first, every
woman, and then carlines that are old. Then there are those terms for
women which are libellous: one may find them in songs, though they be
not ill writing. Those women who have one husband in common are called
Concubines. A son's wife is termed Daughter-in-law; the husband's mother
is called Mother-in-law. A woman may also be called Mother, Grand
mother, Great-Grandmother; a Mother is called Dam. Woman is further
called Daughter, Bairn, and Child. She is also called Sister, Lady,\[1\]
and Maiden.\[1\] Woman is also called Bed-Fellow, Speech-Mate, and
Secret-Sharer of her husband; and that is an epithet of possession.

LXIX\. "A man's head is termed thus: \[thus should it he periphrased:
call it Toil or Burden of the Neck; Land of the Helm, of the Hood, and
of the Brain, of the Hair and Brows, of the Scalp, of Ears, Eves, and
Mouth; Sword of Heimdallr, arid it is correct to name any term for sword
which one desires; and to periphrase it in terms of every one of the
names of Heimdallr\]\[2\] the Head, in simple terms, is called Skull,
Brain, Temple, Crown. The eyes are termed Vision or Glance, and Regard,
Swift-Appraising; \[they may he so periphrased as to call them Sun or
Moon, Shields and Glass or Jewels or Stones of the Eyelids, of the
Brows, the Lashes, or the Forehead\]. The ears are called Listeners\[3\]
or Hearing;\[3\] \[one should periphrase

\[1. *Dís*; properly = sister. For discussion of these words, see under
*dís* in Cl.-Vig., p. 100.

2\. This and other pages in brackets are probably spurious.

3\. These are the literal meanings; the meanings, in general usage,
coincide: both words signify the inner parts of the ear (Cl.-Vig.).\]

{p. 238}

them by calling them Land, or any earth-name, or Mouth, or Canal, or
Vision, or Eyes of Hearing, if the metaphors employed are new-coined.
The mouth one should periphrase by calling it Land or House of the
Tongue or of the Teeth, of Words or of the Palate, of the Lips, or the
like; and if the metaphors used are not traditional, then men may call
the mouth Ship, and the lips the Planks, and the tongue Oar or Tiller of
the Ship. The teeth are sometimes called Gravel or Rocks of Words, of
the Mouth, or of the Tongue. The tongue is often called Sword of Speech
or of the Mouth\]. The hair which stands on the lips is called Beard,
Moustache, or Whiskers. Hair is called Nap; the hair of women is called
Tresses. Hair is termed Locks. \[One may periphrase hair by calling it
Forest, or by some tree-name; one may periphrase it in terms of the
skull or brain or head; and the beard in terms of chin or cheeks or
throat.\]

LXX\. The heart is called grain-sheaf; \[one should periphrase it by
terming it Grain or Stone or Apple or Nut or Ball, or the like, in
figures of the breast or of feeling. More over, it may be called House
or Earth or Mount of Feeling. One should periphrase the breast by
calling it House or Garth or Ship of the Heart, of Breath, or of the
Liver; Land of Energy, of Feeling, and of Memory\]. Feeling is affection
and emotion, love, passion, desire, love-longing. \[Passion should be
periphrased by calling it Wind of Troll Women; also it is correct to
name what one soever is desired, and to name giants, periphrasing
giantesses as Woman or Mother or Daughter of the Giants.\] Feeling is
also called mood, liking, eagerness, courage, activity, memory,
understanding,

{p. 239}

temper, humor, good faith. It is also wrath, enmity, mischievousness,
grimness, balefulness, grief, sorrow, ill-will, spite, falseness,
faithlessness, fickleness, light-mindedness, baseness, hasty temper,
violence.

LXXI\. "The hand and fore-arm may be called hand, arm, paw, palm. Parts
of the arm are called elbow, upper arm, wolf's joint,\[1\] finger, grip,
wrist, nail, finger-tip, hand-edge, quick. \[One may term the hand Earth
of Weapons or of Defensive Armor; and together with shoulder and arm,
the hollow of the hand and the wrist, it may, be called Earth of Gold
Rings, of the Falcon and the Hawk, and of all the equivalents thereof;
and in new-coined metaphors, Leg of the Shoulder-joint, and Force of the
Bow. The legs may be called Tree of the Soles, of the Insteps, of the
Ankles, or the like; Running Shaft of the Road or of the Way or the
Pace; one may call the leg Tree or Post of all these. The legs are
periphrased in metaphors of snowshoes, shoes, and breeks.\] The parts of
the legs are called thigh, knee, calf, lower leg, upper leg, instep,
arch, sole, toe; \[one may periphrase the leg in terms of all these,
calling it Tree, Mast, and Yard thereof; and in metaphors of them all\].

LXXIII\. "Understanding is called wisdom, counsel, discernment, memory,
speculation, intelligence, arithmetic, far sight,\[1\] craft, word-wit,
preëminence. It is called subtlety, wiliness, falsehood, fickleness.

LXXIV\. "Expression is of two kinds: that which is called voice, and
that which is called manners; manners is also temper. *Reiði*\[2\] also
has double meaning: *reiði*\[2\] is the ill humor of a man, and
*reiði*\[2\] is also the rigging of a ship or the driving-gear of a
horse. *Fár* also has double meaning: *fár*\[2\] signifies wrath, and
*far*\[2\] signifies a ship.

"Men have made frequent use of such ambiguous expressions as these; and
this practice is called punning. \[*Lith*\[3\] is that part of a man
where bones meet; *lið* is a word for ship; *lið* means people; when a
man renders an other assistance, his aid is *lið*; *líð* signifies ale.
*Hlið* signifies the gate in a garth; *hliðr* men call an ox, and *hlíð*
signifies a slope. One may make such use of these distinct meanings in
skaldship as to make a pun that is hard to interpret, provided one
employ other distinctions than those which are indicated by the
half-lines which precede. These cases are there, and many others, in
which divers things have the same name in common.\]"

\[1. That is, prophecy.

2\. These are properly two different words.

3\. *Lið*.\]
