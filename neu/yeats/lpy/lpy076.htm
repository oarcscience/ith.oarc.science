<p>THERE where the course is,<br> Delight makes all of the one mind,<br> The riders upon the galloping horses,<br> The crowd that closes in behind:<br> We, too, had good attendance once,<br> Hearers and hearteners of the work;<br> Aye, horsemen for companions,<br> Before the merchant and the clerk<br> Breathed on the world with timid breath.<br> Sing on: sometime, and at some new moon,<br> We'll learn that sleeping is not death,<br> Hearing the whole earth change its tune,<br> Its flesh being wild, and it again<br> Crying aloud as the racecourse is,<br> And we find hearteners among men<br> That ride upon horses.</p>
