### AN IMAGE FROM A PAST LIFE

HE

NEVER until this night have I been stirred.  
The elaborate star-light throws a reflection  
On the dark stream,  
Till all the eddies gleam;  
And thereupon there comes that scream  
From terrified, invisible beast or bird:  
Image of poignant recollection.

SHE

An image of my heart that is smitten through  
Out of all likelihood, or reason,  
And when at last,  
Youth's bitterness being past,  
I had thought that all my days were cast  
Amid most lovely places; smitten as though  
It had not learned its lesson.

HE

Why have you laid your hands upon my eyes?  
What can have suddenly alarmed you <span id="page_330">p. 330</span>  
Whereon ’twere best  
My eyes should never rest?  
What is there but the slowly fading west,  
The river imaging the flashing skies,  
All that to this moment charmed you?

SHE

A sweetheart from another life floats there  
As though she had been forced to linger  
From vague distress  
Or arrogant loveliness,  
Merely to loosen out a tress  
Among the starry eddies of her hair  
Upon the paleness of a finger.

HE

But why should you grow suddenly afraid  
And start--I at your shoulder--  
Imagining  
That any night could bring  
An image up, or anything  
Even to eyes that beauty had driven mad,  
But images to make me fonder.

SHE

Now she has thrown her arms above her head;  
Whether she threw them up to flout me, <span id="page_331">p.
331</span>  
Or but to find,  
Now that no fingers bind,  
That her hair streams upon the wind,  
I do not know, that know I am afraid  
Of the hovering thing night brought me.
