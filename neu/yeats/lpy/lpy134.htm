<p>THERE is a queen in China, or maybe it's in Spain,<br> And birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard<br> Of her unblemished lineaments, a whiteness with no stain,<br> That she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird;<br> And there's a score of duchesses, surpassing womankind,<br> Or who have found a painter to make them so for pay<br> And smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind:<br> I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.</p>  
<p>The young men every night applaud their Gaby's laughing eye,<br> And Ruth St. Denis had more charm although she had poor luck,<br> From nineteen hundred nine or ten, Pavlova's had the cry,<A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A><br> And there's a player in the States who gathers up her cloak<br> And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be bride<br> With all a woman's passion, a child's imperious way,<br> And there are--but no matter if there are scores beside:<br> I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.</p>  
<p>There's Margaret and Marjorie and Dorothy and Nan,<br> A Daphne and a Mary who live in privacy;<br> One's had her fill of lovers, another's had but one,<br> Another boasts, "I pick and choose and have but two or three."<br> If head and limb have beauty and the instep's high and light<br> They can spread out what sail they please for all I have to say,<br> Be but the breakers of men's hearts or engines of delight:<br> I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.</p>  
<p>There'll be that crowd, that barbarous crowd, through all the centuries,<br> And who can say but some young belle may walk and talk men wild <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A><br> Who is my beauty's equal, though that my heart denies,<br> But not the exact likeness, the simplicity of a child,<br> And that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun,<br> And all the shapely body no tittle gone astray.<br> I mourn for that most lonely thing; and yet God's will be done,<br> I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.</p>
