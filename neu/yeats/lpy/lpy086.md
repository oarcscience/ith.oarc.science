### PAUDEEN

INDIGNANT at the fumbling wits, the obscure spite  
Of our old Paudeen in his shop, I stumbled blind  
Among the stones and thorn trees, under morning light;  
Until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind  
A curlew answered; and suddenly thereupon I thought  
That on the lonely height where all are in God's eye,  
There cannot be, confusion of our sound forgot,  
A single soul that lacks a sweet crystalline cry.
