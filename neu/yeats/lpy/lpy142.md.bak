### IN MEMORY OF ALFRED POLLEXFEN

FIVE-AND-TWENTY years have gone  
Since old William Pollexfen  
Laid his strong bones down in death  
By his wife Elizabeth  
In the grey stone tomb he made.  
And after twenty years they laid  
In that tomb by him and her,  
His son George, the astrologer;  
And Masons drove from miles away  
To scatter the Acacia spray  
Upon a melancholy man  
Who had ended where his breath began.  
Many a son and daughter lies  
Far from the customary skies,  
The Mall and Eades's grammar school,  
In London or in Liverpool;  
But where is laid the sailor John?  
That so many lands had known:  
Quiet lands or unquiet seas  
Where the Indians trade or Japanese.  
He never found his rest ashore  
Moping for one voyage more.  
Where have they laid the sailor John? <span id="page_289">p.

And yesterday the youngest son,  
A humorous, unambitious man,  
Was buried near the astrologer;  
And are we now in the tenth year?  
Since he, who had been contented long,  
A nobody in a great throng,  
Decided he would journey home,  
Now that his fiftieth year had come,  
And "Mr. Alfred" be again  
Upon the lips of common men  
Who carried in their memory  
His childhood and his family.  
At all these death-beds women heard  
A visionary white sea-bird  
Lamenting that a man should die;  
And with that cry I have raised my cry.
