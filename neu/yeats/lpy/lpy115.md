### MEN IMPROVE WITH THE YEARS

I AM worn out with dreams;  
A weather-worn, marble triton  
Among the streams;  
And all day long I look  
Upon this lady's beauty  
As though I had found in book  
A pictured beauty,  
Pleased to have filled the eyes  
Or the discerning ears,  
Delighted to be but wise,  
For men improve with the years;  
And yet and yet  
Is this my dream, or the truth?  
O would that we had met  
When I had my burning youth;  
But I grow old among dreams,  
A weather-worn, marble triton  
Among the streams.
