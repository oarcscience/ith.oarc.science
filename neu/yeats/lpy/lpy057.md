### THE HARP OF AENGUS

*EDAIN came out of Midher's hill, and lay  
Beside young Aengus in his tower of glass,  
Where time is drowned in odour-laden winds  
And druid moons, and murmuring of boughs,  
And sleepy boughs, and boughs where apples made  
Of opal and ruby and pale chrysolite  
Awake unsleeping fires; and wove seven strings,  
Sweet with all music, out of his long hair,  
Because her hands had been made wild by love.  
When Midher's wife had changed her to a fly,  
He made a harp with druid apple wood  
That she among her winds might know he wept;  
And from that hour he has watched over none  
But faithful lovers*.
