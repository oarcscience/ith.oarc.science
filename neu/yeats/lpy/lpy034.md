### A LOVER SPEAKS TO THE HEARERS OF HIS SONGS IN COMING DAYS

O, WOMEN, kneeling by your altar rails long hence,  
When songs I wove for my beloved hide the prayer,  
And smoke from this dead heart drifts through the violet air  
And covers away the smoke of myrrh and frankincense;  
Bend down and pray for all that sin I wove in song,  
Till the Attorney for Lost Souls cry her sweet cry,  
And call to my beloved and me: "No longer fly  
Amid the hovering, piteous, penitential throng."
