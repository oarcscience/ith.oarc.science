### THE POET PLEADS WITH THE ELEMENTAL POWERS

THE Powers whose name and shape no living creature knows  
Have pulled the Immortal Rose;  
And though the Seven Lights bowed in their dance and wept,  
The Polar Dragon slept,  
His heavy rings uncoiled from glimmering deep to deep:  
When will he wake from sleep?

Great Powers of falling wave and wind and windy fire,  
With your harmonious choir  
Encircle her I love and sing her into peace,  
That my old care may cease;  
Unfold your flaming wings and cover out of sight  
The nets of day and night. <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

Dim Powers of drowsy thought, let her no longer be  
Like the pale cup of the sea,  
When winds have gathered and sun and moon burned dim  
Above its cloudy rim;  
But let a gentle silence wrought with music flow  
Whither her footsteps go.
