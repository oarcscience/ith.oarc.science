### FRIENDS

Now must I these three praise--  
Three women that have wrought  
What joy is in my days;  
One that no passing thought,  
Nor those unpassing cares,  
No, not in these fifteen  
Many times troubled years,  
Could ever come between  
Heart and delighted heart;  
And one because her hand  
Had strength that could unbind  
What none can understand,  
What none can have and thrive,  
Youth's dreamy load, till she  
So changed me that I live  
Labouring in ecstasy.  
And what of her that took  
All till my youth was gone  
With scarce a pitying look?  
How should I praise that one?  
When day begins to break  
I count my good and bad,  
Being wakeful for her sake, <span id="page_227">p. 227</span>  
Remembering what she had,  
What eagle look still shows,  
While up from my heart's root  
So great a sweetness flows  
I shake from head to foot.
