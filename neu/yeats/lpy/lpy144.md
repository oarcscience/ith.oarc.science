### EGO DOMINUS TUUS

HIC

ON the grey sand beside the shallow stream  
Under your old wind-beaten tower, where still  
A lamp burns on beside the open book  
That Michael Robartes left, you walk in the moon  
And though you have passed the best of life still trace  
Enthralled by the unconquerable delusion  
Magical shapes.

ILLE

By the help of an image  
I call to my own opposite, summon all  
That I have handled least, least looked upon.

HIC

And I would find myself and not an image.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

ILLE

That is our modern hope and by its light  
We have lit upon the gentle, sensitive mind  
And lost the old nonchalance of the hand;  
Whether we have chosen chisel, pen or brush  
We are but critics, or but half create  
Timid, entangled, empty and abashed  
Lacking the countenance of our friends.

HIC

                                     And yet  
The chief imagination of Christendom  
Dante Alighieri so utterly found himself  
That he has made that hollow face of his  
More plain to the mind's eye than any face  
But that of Christ.

ILLE

                      And did he find himself  
Or was the hunger that had made it hollow  
A hunger for the apple on the bough  
Most out of reach? and is that spectral image  
The man that Lapo and that Guido knew?  
I think he fashioned from his opposite  
An image that might have been a stony face,  
Staring upon a bedouin's horse-hair roof <span id="page_297">p.
297</span>  
From doored and windowed cliff, or half upturned  
Among the coarse grass and the camel dung.  
He set his chisel to the hardest stone.  
Being mocked by Guido for his lecherous life  
Derided and deriding, driven out  
To climb that stair and eat that bitter bread,  
He found the unpersuadable justice, he found  
The most exalted lady loved by a man.

HIC

Yet surely there are men who have made their art  
Out of no tragic war, lovers of life,  
Impulsive men that look for happiness  
And sing when they have found it.

ILLE

                               No not sing,  
For those that love the world serve it in action,  
Grow rich, popular and full of influence,  
And should they paint or write still it is action:  
The struggle of the fly in marmalade.  
The rhetorician would deceive his neighbours, <span id="page_298">p.
298</span>S  
The sentimentalist himself; while art  
Is but a vision of reality.  
What portion in the world can the artist have  
Who has awakened from the common dream  
But dissipation and despair?

HIC

                                 And yet  
No one denies to Keats love of the world;  
Remember his deliberate happiness.

ILLE

His art is happy but who knows his mind?  
I see a schoolboy when I think of him  
With face and nose pressed to a sweet-shop window,  
For certainly he sank into his grave  
His senses and his heart unsatisfied,  
And made--being poor, ailing and ignorant,  
Shut out from all the luxury of the world,  
The coarse-bred son of a livery stable-keeper-  
Luxuriant song.

HIC

Why should you leave the lamp  
Burning alone beside an open book, <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>  
And trace these characters upon the sands?  
A style is found by sedentary toil  
And by the imitation of great masters.

ILLE

Because I seek an image not a book.  
Those men that in their writings are most wise  
Own nothing but their blind, stupefied hearts.  
I call to the mysterious one who yet  
Shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream  
And look most like me, being indeed my double,  
And prove of all imaginable things  
The most unlike, being my anti-self,  
And standing by these characters disclose  
All that I seek; and whisper it as though  
He .were afraid the birds, who cry aloud  
Their momentary cries before it is dawn,  
Would carry it away to blasphemous men.
