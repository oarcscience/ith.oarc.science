### PRESENCES

THIS night has been so strange that it seemed  
As if the hair stood up on my head.  
From going-down of the sun I have dreamed  
That women laughing, or timid or wild,  
In rustle of lace or silken stuff,  
Climbed up my creaking stair. They had read  
All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing  
Returned and yet unrequited love.  
They stood in the door and stood between  
My great wood lecturn and the fire  
Till I could hear their hearts beating:  
One is a harlot, and one a child  
That never looked upon man with desire,  
And one it may be a queen.
