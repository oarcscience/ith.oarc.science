### THE PHASES OF THE MOON

*AN old man cocked his ear upon a bridge;  
He and his friend, their faces to the South,  
Had trod the uneven road. Their boots were soiled,  
Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape;  
They had kept a steady pace as though their beds,  
Despite a dwindling and late risen moon,  
Were distant. An old man cocked his ear*.

AHERNE

What made that sound?

ROBARTES

                           A rat or water-hen  
Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream.  
We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,  
And the light proves that he is reading still.  
He has found, after the manner of his kind,  
Mere images; chosen this place to live in  
Because, it may be, of the candle light <span id="page_302">p.
302</span>  
From the far tower where Milton's platonist  
Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:  
The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,  
An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;  
And now he seeks in book or manuscript  
What he shall never find.

AHERNE

                          Why should not you  
Who know it all ring at his door, and speak  
Just truth enough to show that his whole life  
Will scarcely find for him a broken crust  
Of all those truths that are your daily bread;  
And when you have spoken take the roads again?

ROBARTES

He wrote of me in that extravagant style  
He had learnt from Pater, and to round his tale  
Said I was dead; and dead I choose to be.

AHERNE

Sing me the changes of the moon once more;  
True song, though speech: "mine author sung it me."

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

ROBARTES

Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon,  
The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,  
Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty  
The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in:  
For there's no human life at the full or the dark.  
From the first crescent to the half, the dream  
But summons to adventure and the man  
Is always happy like a bird or a beast;  
But while the moon is rounding towards the full  
He follows whatever whim's most difficult  
Among whims not impossible, and though scarred,  
As with the cat-o’-nine-tails of the mind,  
His body moulded from within his body  
Grows comelier. Eleven pass, and then  
Athenae takes Achilles by the hair,  
Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,  
Because the heroes' crescent is the twelfth.  
And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must,  
Before the full moon, helpless as a worm.  
The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war <span id="page_304">p.
304</span>  
In its own being, and when that war's begun  
There is no muscle in the arm; and after  
Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon  
The soul begins to tremble into stillness,  
To die into the labyrinth of itself!

AHERNE

Sing out the song; sing to the end, and sing  
The strange reward of all that discipline.

ROBARTES

All thought becomes an image and the soul  
Becomes a body: that body and that soul  
Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle,  
Too lonely for the traffic of the world:  
Body and soul cast out and cast away  
Beyond the visible world.

AHERNE

                       All dreams of the soul  
End in a beautiful man's or woman's body.

ROBARTES

Have you not always known it?

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

AHERNE

The song will have it  
That those that we have loved got their long fingers  
From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top,  
Or from some bloody whip in their own hands.  
They ran from cradle to cradle till at last  
Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness  
Of body and soul.

ROBARTES

The lovers' heart knows that.

AHERNE

It must be that the terror in their eyes  
Is memory or foreknowledge of the hour  
When all is fed with light and heaven is bare.

ROBARTES

When the moon's full those creatures of the full  
Are met on the waste hills by country men  
Who shudder and hurry by: body and soul  
Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves <span id="page_306">p.
306</span>  
Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye  
Fixed upon images that once were thought,  
For separate, perfect, and immovable  
Images can break the solitude  
Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes.

*And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice  
Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within,  
His sleepless candle and laborious pen*.

ROBARTES

And after that the crumbling of the moon.  
The soul remembering its loneliness  
Shudders in many cradles; all is changed,  
It would be the world's servant, and as it serves,  
Choosing whatever task's most difficult  
Among tasks not impossible, it takes  
Upon the body and upon the soul  
The coarseness of the drudge.

AHERNE

                             Before the full  
It sought itself and afterwards the world.

ROBARTES

Because you are forgotten, half out of life,  
And never wrote a book your thought is clear. <span id="page_307">p.
307</span>  
Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man,  
Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn,  
Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all  
Deformed because there is no deformity  
But saves us from a dream.

AHERNE

                          And what of those  
That the last servile crescent has set free?

ROBARTES

Because all dark, like those that are all light,  
They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud,  
Crying to one another like the bats;  
And having no desire they cannot tell  
What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph  
At the perfection of one's own obedience;  
And yet they speak what's blown into the mind;  
Deformed beyond deformity, unformed,  
Insipid as the dough before it is baked,  
They change their bodies at a word.

AHERNE

And then?

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

ROBARTES

When all the dough has been so kneaded up  
That it can take what form cook Nature fancy  
The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more.

AHERNE

But the escape; the song's not finished yet.

ROBARTES

Hunchback and saint and fool are the last crescents.  
The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow  
Out of the up and down, the wagon wheel  
Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter--  
Out of that raving tide--is drawn betwixt  
Deformity of body and of mind.

AHERNE

Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,  
Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall  
Beside the castle door, where all is stark  
Austerity, a place set out for wisdom  
That he will never find; I'd play a part; <span id="page_309">p.
309</span>  
He would never know me after all these years  
But take me for some drunken country man;  
I'd stand and mutter there until he caught  
"Hunchback and saint and fool," and that they came  
Under the three last crescents of the moon,  
And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits  
Day after day, yet never find the meaning.

*And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard  
Should be so simple--a bat rose from the hazels  
And circled round him with its squeaky cry,  
The light in the tower window was put out*.
