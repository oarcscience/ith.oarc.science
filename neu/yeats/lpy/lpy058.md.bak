### THE SHADOWY WATERS

*The deck of an ancient ship. At the right of the stage is the mast,
with a large square sail hiding a great deal of the sky and sea on that
side. The tiller is at the left of the stage; it is a long oar coming
through an opening in the bulwark. The deck rises in a series of steps
behind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves overhead. When the
play opens there are four persons upon the deck.* AIBRIC *stands by the
tiller.* FORGAEL *sleeps upon the raised portion of the deck towards the
front of the stage. Two* SAILORS *are standing near to the mast, on
which a harp is hanging*.

FIRST SAILOR

Has he not led us into these waste seas  
For long enough?

SECOND SAILOR

Aye, long and long enough.

FIRST SAILOR

We have not come upon a shore or ship  
These dozen weeks.

 

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

SECOND SAILOR

                And I had thought to make  
A good round sum upon this cruise, and turn--  
For I am getting on in life--to something  
That has less ups and downs than robbery.

FIRST SAILOR

I am so tired of being bachelor  
I could give all my heart to that Red Moll  
That had but the one eye.

SECOND SAILOR

Can no bewitchment  
Transform these rascal billows into women  
That I may drown myself?

FIRST SAILOR

                          Better steer home,  
Whether he will or no; and better still  
To take him while he sleeps and carry him  
And drop him from the gunnel.

SECOND SAILOR

                              I dare not do it.  
Were't not that there is magic in his harp, <span id="page_101">p.
101</span>  
I would be of your mind; but when he plays it  
Strange creatures flutter up before one's eyes,  
Or cry about one's ears.

FIRST SAILOR

Nothing to fear.

SECOND SAILOR

Do you remember when we sank that galley  
At the full moon?

FIRST SAILOR

He played all through the night.

SECOND SAILOR

Until the moon had set; and when I looked  
Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird  
Like a grey gull upon the breast of each.  
While I was looking they rose hurriedly,  
And after circling with strange cries awhile  
Flew westward; and many a time since then  
I've heard a rustling overhead in the wind.

FIRST SAILOR

I saw them on that night as well as you.  
But when I had eaten and drunk myself asleep  
My courage came again.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

SECOND SAILOR

                           But that's not all.  
The other night, while he was playing it,  
A beautiful young man and girl came up  
In a white, breaking wave; they had the look  
Of those that are alive for ever and ever.

FIRST SAILOR

I saw them, too, one night. Forgael was playing,  
And they were listening there beyond the sail.  
He could not see them, but I held out my hands  
To grasp the woman.

SECOND SAILOR

You have dared to touch her?

FIRST SAILOR

O, she was but a shadow, and slipped from me.

SECOND SAILOR

But were you not afraid?

FIRST SAILOR

Why should I fear?

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

SECOND SAILOR

’Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering lovers,  
To whom all lovers pray.

FIRST SAILOR

                            But what of that?  
A shadow does not carry sword or spear.

SECOND SAILOR

My mother told me that there is not one  
Of the Ever-living half so dangerous  
As that wild Aengus. Long before her day  
He carried Edain off from a king's house,  
And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone  
And in a tower of glass, and from that day  
Has hated every man that's not in love,  
And has been dangerous to him.

FIRST SAILOR

                                  I have heard  
He does not hate seafarers as he hates  
Peaceable men that shut the wind away,  
And keep to the one weary marriage-bed.

SECOND SAILOR

I think that he has Forgael in his net,  
And drags him through the sea.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

FIRST SAILOR

                           Well, net or none,  
I'd drown him while we have the chance to do it.

SECOND SAILOR

It's certain I'd sleep easier o' nights  
If he were dead; but who will be our captain,  
Judge of the stars, and find a course for us?

FIRST SAILOR

I've thought of that. We must have Aibric with us,  
For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.  
                        \[*Going towards* AIBRIC.  
Become our captain, Aibric. I am resolved  
To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps.  
There's not a man but will be glad of it  
When it is over, nor one to grumble at us.

AIBRIC

You have taken pay and made your bargain for it.

FIRST SAILOR

What good is there in this hard way of living,  
Unless we drain more flagons in a year <span id="page_105">p.
105</span>  
And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men  
In their long lives? Will you be of our troop  
And take the captain's share of everything  
And bring us into populous seas again?

AIBRIC

Be of your troop! Aibric be one of you  
And Forgael in the other scale! kill Forgael,  
And he my master from my childhood up!  
If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard  
I'll give my answer.

FIRST SAILOR

You have awaked him.  
\[*To* SECOND SAILOR.  
We'd better go, for we have lost this chance.  
\[*They go out*.

FORGAEL

Have the birds passed us? I could hear your voice.  
But there were others.

AIBRIC

I have seen nothing pass.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

FORGAEL

You're certain of it? I never wake from sleep  
But that I am afraid they may have passed,  
For they're my only pilots. If I lost them  
Straying too far into the north or south,  
I'd never come upon the happiness  
That has been promised me. I have not seen them  
These many days; and yet there must be many  
Dying at every moment in the world,  
And flying towards their peace.

AIBRIC

                       Put by these thoughts,  
And listen to me for awhile. The sailors  
Are plotting for your death.

FORGAEL

                            Have I not given  
More riches than they ever hoped to find?  
And now they will not follow, while I seek  
The only riches that have hit my fancy.

AIBRIC

What riches can you find in this waste sea  
Where no ship sails, where nothing that's alive <span id="page_107">p.
107</span>  
Has ever come but those man-headed birds,  
Knowing it for the world's end?

FORGAEL

                        Where the world ends  
The mind is made unchanging, for it finds  
Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope,  
The flagstone under all, the fire of fires,  
The roots of the world.

AIBRIC

                     Who knows that shadows  
May not have driven you mad for their own sport?

FORGAEL

Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their plot?

AIBRIC

No, no, do not say that. You know right well  
That I will never lift a hand against you.

FORGAEL

Why should you be more faithful than the rest,  
Being as doubtful?

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

AIBRIC

                      I have called you master  
Too many years to lift a hand against you.

FORGAEL

Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.  
You've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,  
A melancholy that a cup of wine,  
A lucky battle, or a woman's kiss  
Could not amend.

AIBRIC

I have good spirits enough.

FORGAEL

If you will give me all your mind awhile--  
All, all, the very bottom of the bowl--  
I'll show you that I am made differently,  
That nothing can amend it but these waters,  
Where I am rid of life--the events of the world--  
What do you call it?--that old promise-breaker,  
The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,  
"You will have all you have wished for when you have earned  
Land for your children or money in a pot." <span id="page_109">p.
109</span>  
And when we have it we are no happier,  
Because of that old draught under the door,  
Or creaky shoes. And at the end of all  
How are we better off than Seaghan the fool,  
That never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!  
We have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living  
Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world,  
And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,  
And find their laughter sweeter to the taste  
For that brief sighing.

AIBRIC

If you had loved some woman--

FORGAEL

You say that also? You have heard the voices,  
For that is what they say--all, all the shadows--  
Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,  
And all the others; but it must be love  
As they have known it. Now the secret's out;  
For it is love that I am seeking for, <span id="page_110">p.
110</span>  
But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind  
That is not in the world.

AIBRIC

                           And yet the world  
Has beautiful women to please every man.

FORGAEL

But he that gets their love after the fashion  
Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope  
And bodily tenderness, and finds that even  
The bed of love, that in the imagination  
Had seemed to be the giver of all peace,  
Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,  
And as soon finished.

AIBRIC

                           All that ever loved  
Have loved that way--there is no other way.

FORGAEL

Yet never have two lovers kissed but they  
Believed there was some other near at hand,  
And almost wept because they could not find it.

AIBRIC

When they have twenty years; in middle life  
They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,  
And let the dream go by.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

FORGAEL

                              It's not a dream,  
But the reality that makes our passion  
As a lamp shadow--no--no lamp, the sun.  
What the world's million lips are thirsting for,  
Must be substantial somewhere.

AIBRIC

I have heard the Druids  
Mutter such things as they awake from trance.  
It may be that the Ever-living know it--  
No mortal can.

FORGAEL

Yes; if they give us help.

AIBRIC

They are besotting you as they besot  
The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows  
That he has been all night upon the hills,  
Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host  
With the Ever-living.

FORGAEL

                  What if he speak the truth,  
And for a dozen hours have been a part  
Of that more powerful life?

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

AIBRIC

                      His wife knows better.  
Has she not seen him lying like a log,  
Or fumbling in a dream about the house?  
And if she hear him mutter of wild riders,  
She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing  
That set him to the fancy.

FORGAEL

                            All would be well  
Could we but give us wholly to the dreams,  
And get into their world that to the sense  
Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly  
Among substantial things; for it is dreams  
That lift us to the flowing, changing world  
That the heart longs for. What is love itself,  
Even though it be the lightest of light love,  
But dreams that hurry from beyond the world  
To make low laughter more than meat and drink,  
Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,  
Could we but mix ourselves into a dream,  
Not in its image on the mirror!

AIBRIC

                                   While  
We're in the body that's impossible,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

FORGAEL

And yet I cannot think they're leading me  
To death; for they that promised to me love  
As those that can outlive the moon have known it,  
Had the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,  
Into their shining limbs--I've had great teachers.  
Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave--  
You'd never doubt that it was life they promised  
Had you looked on them face to face as I did,  
With so red lips, and running on such feet,  
And having such wide-open, shining eyes.

AIBRIC

It's certain they are leading you to death.  
None but the dead, or those that never lived,  
Can know that ecstasy. Forgael! Forgael!  
They have made you follow the man-headed birds,  
And you have told me that their journey lies  
Towards the country of the dead.

FORGAEL

                                   What matter  
If I am going to my death, for there,  
Or somewhere, I shall find the love they  
have promised. <span id="page_114">p. 114</span>  
That much is certain. I shall find a woman,  
One of the Ever-living, as I think--  
One of the Laughing People--and she and I  
Shall light upon a place in the world's core,  
Where passion grows to be a changeless thing,  
Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase,  
Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysolite;  
And there, in juggleries of sight and sense,  
Become one movement, energy, delight,  
Until the overburthened moon is dead.

\[*A number of* SAILORS *enter hurriedly*.\]

FIRST SAILOR

Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice  
And we are almost on her!

SECOND SAILOR

                           We had not known  
But for the ambergris and sandalwood.

FIRST SAILOR

No; but opoponax and cinnamon.

FORGAEL

\[*Taking the tiller from* AIBRIC\]

The Ever-living have kept my bargain for me,  
And paid you on the nail.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

AIBRIC

                         Take up that rope  
To make her fast while we are plundering her.

FIRST SAILOR

There is a king and queen upon her deck,  
And where there is one woman there'll be others.

AIBRIC

Speak lower, or they'll hear.

FIRST SAILOR

                           They cannot hear;  
They are too busy with each other. Look!  
He has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.

SECOND SAILOR

When she finds out we have better men aboard  
She may not be too sorry in the end.

FIRST SAILOR

She will be like a wild cat; for these queens  
Care more about the kegs of silver and gold  
And the high fame that come to them in marriage,  
Than a strong body and a ready hand.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

SECOND SAILOR

There's nobody is natural but a robber,  
And that is why the world totters about  
Upon its bandy legs.

AIBRIC

Run at them now,  
And overpower the crew while yet asleep!  
\[*The SAILORS go out*.  
\[*Voices and the clashing of swords are heard from the other ship,
which cannot be seen because of the sail*.

A VOICE

Armed men have come upon us! O, I am slain!

ANOTHER VOICE

Wake all below!

ANOTHER VOICE

Why have you broken our sleep?

FIRST VOICE

Armed men have come upon us! O, I am slain!

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

FORGAEL

\[*Who has remained at the tiller*\]

There! there they come! Gull, gannet, or diver,  
But with a man's head, or a fair woman's,  
They hover over the masthead awhile  
To wait their friends; but when their friends have come  
They'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.  
One--and one--a couple--five together;  
And I will hear them talking in a minute.  
Yes, voices! but I do not catch the words.  
Now I can hear. There's one of them that says:  
"How light we are, now we are changed to birds!"  
Another answers: "Maybe we shall find  
Our heart's desire now that we are so light."  
And then one asks another how he died,  
And says: "A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep."  
And now they all wheel suddenly and fly  
To the other side, and higher in the air.  
And now a laggard with a woman's head  
Comes crying, "I have run upon the sword.  
I have fled to my beloved in the air,  
In the waste of the high air, that we may wander  
Among the windy meadows of the dawn."  
But why are they still waiting? why are they <span id="page_118">p.
118</span>  
Circling and circling over the masthead?  
What power that is more mighty than desire  
To hurry to their hidden happiness  
Withholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones  
A meaning in that circling overhead?  
But what's the meaning? \[*He cries out*.\]  
Why do you linger there?  
Why do you not run to your desire,  
Now that you have happy winged bodies?  
                        \[*His voice sinks again*.  
Being too busy in the air and the high air,  
They cannot hear my voice; but what's the  
meaning?

\[*The* SAILORS *have returned.* DECTORA *is with them*.

FORGAEL

\[T*urning and seeing her*\]

Why are you standing with your eyes upon me?  
You are not the world's core. O no, no, no!  
That cannot be the meaning of the birds.  
You are not its core. My teeth are in the world,  
But have not bitten yet.

DECTORA

                             I am a queen,  
And ask for satisfaction upon these <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>  
Who have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.  
           \[*Breaking loose from the* SAILORS *who are holding her*.  
Let go my hands!

FORGAEL

                 Why do you cast a shadow?  
Where do you come from? Who brought you to this place?  
They would not send me one that casts a shadow.

DECTORA

Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,  
And drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,  
And blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,  
Had drowned me also. But, being yet alive,  
I ask a fitting punishment for all  
That raised their hands against him.

FORGAEL

                             There are some  
That weigh and measure all in these waste seas--  
They that have all the wisdom that's in life,  
And all that prophesying images  
Made of dim gold rave out in secret tombs; <span id="page_120">p.
120</span>  
They have it that the plans of kings and queens  
Are dust on the moth's wing; that nothing matters  
But laughter and tears--laughter, laughter, and tears;  
That every man should carry his own soul  
Upon his shoulders.

DECTORA

You've nothing but wild words,  
And I would know if you will give me vengeance.

FORGAEL

When she finds out I will not let her go--  
When she knows that.

DECTORA

What is it that you are muttering--  
That you'll not let me go? I am a queen.

FORGAEL

Although you are more beautiful than any,  
I almost long that it were possible;  
But if I were to put you on that ship,  
With sailors that were sworn to do your will,  
And you had spread a sail for home, a wind  
Would rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge, <span id="page_121">p.
121</span>  
It had washed among the stars and put them out,  
And beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,  
Until you stood before me on the deck--  
As now.

DECTORA

        Does wandering in these desolate seas  
And listening to the cry of wind and wave  
Bring madness?

FORGAEL

Queen, I am not mad.

DECTORA

And yet you say the water and the wind  
Would rise against me.

FORGAEL

                          No, I am not mad--  
If it be not that hearing messages  
From lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,  
At the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.

DECTORA

And did those watchers bid you take me captive?

FORGAEL

Both you and I are taken in the net.  
It was their hands that plucked the winds awake <span id="page_122">p.
122</span>  
And blew you hither; and their mouths have promised  
I shall have love in their immortal fashion;  
And for this end they gave me my old harp  
That is more mighty than the sun and moon,  
Or than the shivering casting-net of the stars,  
That none might take you from me.

DECTORA

\[*First trembling back from the mast where the harp is, and then
laughing*\]

                                For a moment  
Your raving of a message and a harp  
More mighty than the stars half troubled me,  
But all that's raving. Who is there can compel  
The daughter and the granddaughter of kings  
To be his bedfellow?

FORGAEL

                          Until your lips  
Have called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.

DECTORA

My husband and my king died at my feet,  
And yet you talk of love.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

FORGAEL

                      The movement of time  
Is shaken in these seas, and what one does  
One moment has no might upon the moment  
That follows after.

DECTORA

                      I understand you now.  
You have a Druid craft of wicked sound  
Wrung from the cold women of the sea--  
A magic that can call a demon up,  
Until my body give you kiss for kiss.

FORGAEL

Your soul shall give the kiss.

DECTORA

                             I am not afraid,  
While there's a rope to run into a noose  
Or wave to drown. But I have done with words,  
And I would have you look into my face  
And know that it is fearless.

FORGAEL

                           Do what you will,  
For neither I nor you can break a mesh  
Of the great golden net that is about us.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

DECTORA

There's nothing in the world that's worth a fear.  
      \[*She passes* FORGAEL *and stands for a moment looking into his
face*.  
I have good reason for that thought.  
      \[*She runs suddenly on to the raised part of the poop*.  
                                      And now  
I can put fear away as a queen should.  
       \[*She mounts on to the bulwark and turns towards* FORGAEL.  
Fool, fool Although you have looked into my face  
You do not see my purpose. I shall have gone  
Before a hand can touch me.

FORGAEL

\[*Folding his arms*\]

                         My hands are still;  
The Ever-living hold us. Do what you will,  
You cannot leap out of the golden net.

FIRST SAILOR

No need to drown, for, if you will pardon us  
And measure out a course and bring us home,  
We'll put this man to death.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

DECTORA

I promise it.

FIRST SAILOR

There is none to take his side.

AIBRIC

I am on his side.  
I'll strike a blow for him to give him time  
To cast his dreams away.  
         \[AIBRIC *goes in front of* FORGAEL *with drawn sword*. FORGAEL
*takes the harp*.

FIRST SAILOR

No other'll do it.  
\[*The* SAILORS *throw* AIBRIC *on one side. He falls and lies upon the
deck. They lift their swords to strike* FORGAEL*, who is about to play
the harp. The stage begins to darken. The* SAILORS *hesitate in fear*.

SECOND SAILOR

He has put a sudden darkness over the moon.

DECTORA

Nine swords with handles of rhinoceros horn  
To him that strikes him first!

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

FIRST SAILOR

I will strike him first.  
\[*He goes close up to* FORGAEL *with his sword lifted*.  
\[*Shrinking back*.\] He has caught the crescent moon out of the sky,  
And carries it between us.

SECOND SAILOR

                               Holy fire  
To burn us to the marrow if we strike.

DECTORA

I'll give a golden galley full of fruit,  
That has the heady flavour of new wine,  
To him that wounds him to the death.

FIRST SAILOR

                                    I'll do it.  
For all his spells will vanish when he dies,  
Having their life in him.

SECOND SAILOR

                      Though it be the moon  
That he is holding up between us there,  
I will strike at him.

THE OTHERS

And I! And I! And I!  
\[FORGAEL *plays the harp*.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

FIRST SAILOR

\[*Falling into a dream suddenly*\]

But you were saying there is somebody  
Upon that other ship we are to wake.  
You did not know what brought him to his end,  
But it was sudden.

SECOND SAILOR

You are in the right;  
I had forgotten that we must go wake him.

DECTORA

He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,  
And set you dreaming.

SECOND SAILOR

How can we have a wake  
When we have neither brown nor yellow ale?

FIRST SAILOR

I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.

THIRD SAILOR

How can we raise the keen that do not know  
What name to call him by?

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

FIRST SAILOR

Come to his ship.  
His name will come into our thoughts in a minute.  
I know that he died a thousand years ago,  
And has not yet been waked.

SECOND SAILOR

\[*Beginning to keen*\]

                        Ohone! O! O! O!  
The yew bough has been broken into two,  
And all the birds are scattered.

ALL THE SAILORS

O! O! O! O!  
\[*They go out keening*.

DECTORA

Protect me now, gods, that my people swear by.  
    \[AIBRIC *has risen from the deck where he had fallen. He has begun
looking for his sword as if in a dream*.

AIBRIC

Where is my sword that fell out of my hand  
When I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!  
    \[*He goes dreamily towards the sword, but* DECTORA *runs at it and
takes it up before he can reach it*.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

AIBRIC \[*sleepily*\]

Queen, give it me.

DECTORA

No, I have need of it.

AIBRIC

Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it,  
Now that he's dead I have no need of it,  
For everything is gone.

A SAILOR

\[*Calling from the other ship*\]

                         Come hither, Aibric,  
And tell me who it is that we are waking.

AIBRIC

\[*Half to* DECTORA, *half to himself*\]

What name had that dead king? Arthur of Britain?  
No, no--not Arthur. I remember now.  
It was golden-armed Iollan, and he died  
Broken-hearted, having lost his queen  
Through wicked spells. That is not all the tale,  
For he was killed. O! O! O! O! O! O!

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

For golden-armed Iollan has been killed.  
                \[He goes out.  
    \[*While he has been speaking, and through part of what follows, one
hears the wailing of the* SAILORS *from the other ship.* DECTORA *stands
with the sword lifted in front of* FORGAEL.

DECTORA

I will end all your magic on the instant.  
            \[*Her voice becomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword
slowly, and finally lets it fall. She spreads out her hair. She takes
off her crown and lays it upon the deck*.  
This sword is to lie beside him in the grave.  
It was in all his battles. I will spread my hair,  
And wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,  
For I have heard that he was proud and laughing,  
Blue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,  
And that he died a thousand years ago.  
O! O! O!  
                   \[FORGAEL *changes the tune*.  
              But no, that is not it.  
I knew him well, and while I heard him laughing  
They killed him at my feet. O! O! O! O! <span id="page_131">p.
131</span>  
For golden-armed Iollan that I loved.  
But what is it that made me say I loved him?  
It was that harper put it in my thoughts,  
But it is true. Why did they run upon him,  
And beat the golden helmet with their swords?

FORGAEL

Do you not know me, lady? I am he  
That you are weeping for.

DECTORA

No, for he is dead.  
O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.

FORGAEL

It was so given out, but I will prove  
That the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy  
Have buried nothing but my golden arms.  
Listen to that low-laughing string of the moon  
And you will recollect my face and voice,  
For you have listened to me playing it  
These thousand years.  
                \[*He starts up, listening to the birds. The harp slips
from his hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks behind him*.  
                       What are the birds at there? <span
id="page_132">p. 132</span>  
Why are they all a-flutter of a sudden?  
What are you calling out above the mast?  
If railing and reproach and mockery  
Because I have awakened her to love  
My magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:  
Being driven on by voices and by dreams  
That were clear messages from the Ever-living,  
I have done right. What could I but obey?  
And yet you make a clamour of reproach.

DECTORA \[*laughing*\]

Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning  
That I should keen him from the full of the moon  
To the horn, and he be hale and hearty.

FORGAEL

How have I wronged her now that she is merry?  
But no, no, no! your cry is not against me.  
You know the councils of the Ever-living,  
And all that tossing of your wings is joy,  
And all that murmuring's but a marriage song;  
But if it be reproach, I answer this:  
There is not one among you that made love  
By any other means. You call it passion, <span id="page_133">p.
133</span>  
Consideration, generosity;  
But it was all deceit, and flattery  
To win a woman in her own despite,  
For love is war, and there is hatred in it;  
And if you say that she came willingly--

DECTORA

Why do you turn away and hide your face,  
That I would look upon for ever?

FORGAEL

My grief.

DECTORA

Have I not loved you for a thousand years?

FORGAEL

I never have been golden-armed Iollan,

DECTORA

I do not understand. I know your face  
Better than my own hands.

FORGAEL

                             I have deceived you  
Out of all reckoning.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

DECTORA

                          Is it not true  
That you were born a thousand years ago,  
In islands where the children of Aengus wind  
In happy dances under a windy moon,  
And that you'll bring me there?

FORGAEL

                         I have deceived you;  
I have deceived you utterly.

DECTORA

                           How can that be?  
Is it that though your eyes are full of love  
Some other woman has a claim on you,  
And I've but half?

FORGAEL

                   Oh, no!

DECTORA

                          And if there is,  
If there be half a hundred more, what matter?  
I'll never give another thought to it;  
No, no, nor half a thought; but do not speak.  
Women are hard and proud and stubborn-hearted, <span id="page_135">p.
135</span>  
Their heads being turned with praise and flattery;  
And that is why their lovers are afraid  
To tell them a plain story.

FORGAEL

                       That's not the story;  
But I have done so great a wrong against you,  
There is no measure that it would not burst.  
I will confess it all.

DECTORA

                          What do I care,  
Now that my body has begun to dream,  
And you have grown to be a burning sod  
In the imagination and intellect?  
If something that's most fabulous were true--  
If you had taken me by magic spells,  
And killed a lover or husband at my feet--  
I would not let you speak, for I would know  
That it was yesterday and not to-day  
I loved him; I would cover up my ears,  
As I am doing now. \[*A pause*.\] Why do you weep?

FORGAEL

I weep because I've nothing for your eyes  
But desolate waters and a battered ship.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

DECTORA

O, why do you not lift your eyes to mine?

FORGAEL

I weep--I weep because bare night's above,  
And not a roof of ivory and gold.

DECTORA

I would grow jealous of the ivory roof,  
And strike the golden pillars with my hands.  
I would that there was nothing in the world  
But my beloved--that night and day had perished,  
And all that is and all that is to be,  
All that is not the meeting of our lips.

FORGAEL

You turn away. Why do you turn away?  
Am I to fear the waves, or is the moon  
My enemy?

DECTORA

               I looked upon the moon,  
Longing to knead and pull it into shape  
That I might lay it on your head as a crown.  
But now it is your thoughts that wander away,  
For you are looking at the sea. Do you not know <span id="page_137">p.
137</span>  
How great a wrong it is to let one's thought  
Wander a moment when one is in love?  
          \[*He has moved away. She follows him. He is looking out over
the sea, shading his eyes*.\]  
Why are you looking at the sea?

FORGAEL

Look there!

DECTORA

What is there but a troop of ash-grey birds  
That fly into the west?

FORGAEL

But listen, listen!

DECTORA

What is there but the crying of the birds?

FORGAEL

If you'll but listen closely to that crying  
You'll hear them calling out to one another  
With human voices.

DECTORA

                 O, I can hear them now.  
What are they? Unto what country do they fly?

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

FORGAEL

To unimaginable happiness.  
They have been circling over our heads in the air,  
But now that they have taken to the road  
We have to follow, for they are our pilots;  
And though they're but the colour of grey ash,  
They're crying out, could you but hear their words,  
"There is a country at the end of the world  
Where no child's born but to outlive the moon."

\[*The* SAILORS *come in with* AIBRIC*. They are in great excitement*.

FIRST SAILOR

The hold is full of treasure.

SECOND SAILOR

Full to the hatches.

FIRST SAILOR

Treasure on treasure.

THIRD SAILOR

Boxes of precious spice.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

FIRST SAILOR

Ivory images with amethyst eyes.

THIRD SAILOR

Dragons with eyes of ruby.

FIRST SAILOR

                                The whole ship  
Flashes as if it were a net of herrings.

THIRD SAILOR

Let's home; I'd give some rubies to a woman.

SECOND SAILOR

There's somebody I'd give the amethyst eyes to.

AIBRIC

\[*Silencing them with a gesture*\]

We would return to our own country, Forgael,  
For we have found a treasure that's so great  
Imagination cannot reckon it. <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>  
And having lit upon this woman there,  
What more have you to look for on the seas?

FORGAEL

I cannot--I am going on to the end.  
As for this woman, I think she is coming with me.

AIBRIC

The Ever-living have made you mad; but no,  
It was this woman in her woman's vengeance  
That drove you to it, and I fool enough  
To fancy that she'd bring you home again.  
’Twas you that egged him to it, for you know  
That he is being driven to his death.

DECTORA

That is not true, for he has promised me  
An unimaginable happiness.

AIBRIC

And if that happiness be more than dreams,  
More than the froth, the feather, the dust-whirl,  
The crazy nothing that I think it is,  
It shall be in the country of the dead,  
If there be such a country.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

DECTORA

                             No, not there,  
But in some island where the life of the world  
Leaps upward, as if all the streams o' the world  
Had run into one fountain.

AIBRIC

                                 Speak to him.  
He knows that he is taking you to death;  
Speak--he will not deny it.

DECTORA

Is that true?

FORGAEL

I do not know for certain, but I know  
That I have the best of pilots.

AIBRIC

                             Shadows, illusions,  
That the Shape-changers, the Ever-laughing Ones,  
The Immortal Mockers have cast into his mind,  
Or called before his eyes.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

DECTORA

                                  O carry me  
To some sure country, some familiar place.  
Have we not everything that life can give  
In having one another?

FORGAEL

                            How could I rest  
If I refused the messengers and pilots  
With all those sights and all that crying out?

DECTORA

But I will cover up your eyes and ears,  
That you may never hear the cry of the birds,  
Or look upon them.

FORGAEL

                       Were they but lowlier  
I'd do your will, but they are too high--too high.

DECTORA

Being too high, their heady prophecies  
But harry us with hopes that come to nothing,  
Because we are not proud, imperishable,  
Alone and winged.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

FORGAEL

                  Our love shall be like theirs  
When we have put their changeless image on.

DECTORA

I am a woman, I die at every breath.

AIBRIC

Let the birds scatter for the tree is broken,  
And there's no help in words. \[*To the* SAILORS.\]  
To the other ship,  
And I will follow you and cut the rope  
When I have said farewell to this man here,  
For neither I nor any living man  
Will look upon his face again.  
                             \[*The* SAILORS *go out*.

FORGAEL \[*to* DECTORA\]

                                Go with him,  
For he will shelter you and bring you home.

AIBRIC

\[*Taking* FORGAEL'S *hand*\]

I'll do it for his sake.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

DECTORA

No. Take this sword  
And cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael.

AIBRIC

\[*Half falling into the keen*\]

The yew bough has been broken into two,  
And all the birds are scattered--O! O! O!  
Farewell! farewell! \[*He goes out*.

DECTORA

                 The sword is in the rope--  
The rope's in two--it falls into the sea,  
It whirls into the foam. O ancient worm,  
Dragon that loved the world and held us to it,  
You are broken, you are broken. The world drifts away,  
And I am left alone with my beloved,  
Who cannot put me from his sight for ever.  
We are alone for ever, and I laugh,  
Forgael, because you cannot put me from you.  
The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I  
Shall be alone for ever. We two--this crown--  
I half remember. It has been in my dreams.<span id="page_145">p.
145</span>  
Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it.  
O flower of the branch, O bird among the leaves,  
O silver fish that my two hands have taken  
Out of the running stream, O morning star,  
Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn  
Upon the misty border of the wood,  
Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair,  
For we will gaze upon this world no longer.

FORGAEL

\[*Gathering* DECTORA'S *hair about him*\]

Beloved, having dragged the net about us,  
And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;  
And that old harp awakens of itself  
To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,  
That have had dreams for father, live in us.
