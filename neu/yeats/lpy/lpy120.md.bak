### A SONG

I THOUGHT no more was needed  
Youth to prolong  
Than dumb-bell and foil  
To keep the body young.  
Oh, who could have foretold  
That the heart grows old?

Though I have many words,  
What woman's satisfied,  
I am no longer faint  
Because at her side?  
Oh, who could have foretold  
That the heart grows old?

I have not lost desire  
But the heart that I had;  
I thought ’twould burn my body  
Laid on the death-bed,  
For who could have foretold  
That the heart grows old?
