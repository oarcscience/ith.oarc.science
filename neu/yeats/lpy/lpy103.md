### FALLEN MAJESTY

ALTHOUGH crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,  
And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,  
Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping place  
Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.

The lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,  
These, these remain, but I record what's gone. A crowd  
Will gather, and not know it walks the very street  
Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud.
