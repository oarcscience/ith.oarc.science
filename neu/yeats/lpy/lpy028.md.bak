### HE THINKS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN EVIL OF HIS BELOVED

HALF close your eyelids, loosen your hair,  
And dream about the great and their pride;  
They have spoken against you everywhere,  
But weigh this song with the great and their pride;  
I made it out of a mouthful of air,  
Their children's children shall say they have lied.
