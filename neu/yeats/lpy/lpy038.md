### HE THINKS OF HIS PAST GREATNESS WHEN A PART OF THE CONSTELLATIONS OF HEAVEN

I HAVE drunk ale from the Country of the Young  
And weep because I know all things now:  
I have been a hazel tree and they hung  
The Pilot Star and the Crooked Plough  
Among my leaves in times out of mind:  
I became a rush that horses tread:  
I became a man, a hater of the wind,  
Knowing one, out of all things, alone, that his head  
Would not lie on the breast or his lips on the hair  
Of the woman that he loves, until he dies.  
O beast of the wilderness, bird of the air,  
Must I endure your amorous cries?
