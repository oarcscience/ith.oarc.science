### MICHAEL ROBARTES AND THE DANCER

HE

OPINION Is not worth a rush;  
In this altar-piece the knight,  
Who grips his long spear so to push  
That dragon through the fading light,  
Loved the lady; and it's plain  
The half-dead dragon was her thought,  
That every morning rose again  
And dug its claws and shrieked and fought.  
Could the impossible come to pass  
She would have time to turn her eyes,  
Her lover thought, upon the glass  
And on the instant would grow wise.

SHE

You mean they argued.

HE

                           Put it so;  
But bear in mind your lover's wage <span id="page_324">p. 324</span>  
Is what your looking-glass can show,  
And that he will turn green with rage  
At all that is not pictured there.

SHE

May I not put myself to college?

HE

Go pluck Athena by the hair;  
For what mere book can grant a knowledge  
With an impassioned gravity  
Appropriate to that beating breast,  
That vigorous thigh, that dreaming eye?  
And may the devil take the rest.

SHE

And must no beautiful woman be  
Learned like a man?

HE

                         Paul Veronese  
And all his sacred company  
Imagined bodies all their days  
By the lagoon you love so much,  
For proud, soft, ceremonious proof  
That all must come to sight and touch;  
While Michael Angelo's Sistine roof <span id="page_325">p. 325</span>  
His "Morning" and his "Night" disclose  
How sinew that has been pulled tight,  
Or it may be loosened in repose,  
Can rule by supernatural right  
Yet be but sinew.

SHE

                       I have heard said  
There is great danger in the body.

HE

Did God in portioning wine and bread  
Give man His thought or His mere body?

SHE

My wretched dragon is perplexed.

HE

I have principles to prove me right,  
It follows from this Latin text  
That blest souls are not composite,  
And that all beautiful women may  
Live in uncomposite blessedness,  
And lead us to the like--if they  
Will banish every thought, unless  
The lineaments that please their view <span id="page_326">p.
326</span>  
When the long looking-glass is full,  
Even from the foot-sole think it too.

SHE

They say such different things at school.
