### WHEN HELEN LIVED

WE have cried in our despair  
That men desert,  
For some trivial affair  
Or noisy, insolent, sport,  
Beauty that we have won  
From bitterest hours;  
Yet we, had we walked within  
Those topless towers  
Where Helen walked with her boy,  
Had given but as the rest  
Of the men and women of Troy,  
A word and a jest.
