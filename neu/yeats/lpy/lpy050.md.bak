### THE OLD MEN ADMIRING THEMSELVES IN THE WATER

I HEARD the old, old men say,  
"Everything alters,  
And one by one we drop away."  
They had hands like claws, and their knees  
Were twisted like the old thorn trees  
By the waters.  
I heard the old, old men say,  
"All that's beautiful drifts away  
Like the waters."
