<p>THE Powers whose name and shape no living creature knows<br> Have pulled the Immortal Rose;<br> And though the Seven Lights bowed in their dance and wept,<br> The Polar Dragon slept,<br> His heavy rings uncoiled from glimmering deep to deep:<br> When will he wake from sleep?</p>  
<p>Great Powers of falling wave and wind and windy fire,<br> With your harmonious choir<br> Encircle her I love and sing her into peace,<br> That my old care may cease;<br> Unfold your flaming wings and cover out of sight<br> The nets of day and night. <A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Dim Powers of drowsy thought, let her no longer be<br> Like the pale cup of the sea,<br> When winds have gathered and sun and moon burned dim<br> Above its cloudy rim;<br> But let a gentle silence wrought with music flow<br> Whither her footsteps go.</p>
