### THE PEACOCK

WHAT'S riches to him  
That has made a great peacock  
With the pride of his eye?  
The wind-beaten, stone-grey,  
And desolate Three-rock  
Would nourish his whim.  
Live he or die  
Amid wet rocks and heather,  
His ghost will be gay  
Adding feather to feather  
For the pride of his eye.
