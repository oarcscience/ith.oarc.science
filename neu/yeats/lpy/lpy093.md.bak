### RUNNING TO PARADISE

As I came over Windy Gap  
They threw a halfpenny into my cap,  
For I am running to Paradise;  
And all that I need do is to wish  
And somebody puts his hand in the dish  
To throw me a bit of salted fish:  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.

My brother Mourteen is worn out  
With skelping his big brawling lout,  
And I am running to Paradise;  
A poor life do what he can,  
And though he keep a dog and a gun,  
A serving maid and a serving man:  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.

Poor men have grown to be rich men,  
And rich men grown to be poor again,  
And I am running to Paradise;  
And many a darling wit's grown dull  
That tossed a bare heel when at school,  
Now it has filled an old sock full:  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar. <span id="page_211">p.

The wind is old and still at play  
While I must hurry upon my way,  
For I am running to Paradise;  
Yet never have I lit on a friend  
To take my fancy like the wind  
That nobody can buy or bind:  
And there the king *is* but as the beggar.
