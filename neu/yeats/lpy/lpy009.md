### A CRADLE SONG

THE Danaan children laugh, in cradles of wrought gold,  
And clap their hands together, and half close their eyes,  
For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies,  
With heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold:  
I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast,  
And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me.  
Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea;  
Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West;  
Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat  
The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost;  
O heart the winds have shaken; the unappeasable host  
Is comelier than candles at Mother Mary's feet.
