### A PRAYER ON GOING INTO MY HOUSE

GOD grant a blessing on this tower and cottage  
And on my heirs, if all remain unspoiled,  
No table, or chair or stool not simple enough  
For shepherd lads in Galilee; and grant  
That I myself for portions of the year  
May handle nothing and set eyes on nothing  
But what the great and passionate have used  
Throughout so many varying centuries.  
We take it for the norm; yet should I dream  
Sinbad the sailor's brought a painted chest,  
Or image, from beyond the Loadstone Mountain,  
That dream is a norm; and should some limb of the devil  
Destroy the view by cutting down an ash  
That shades the road, or setting up a cottage  
Planned in a government office, shorten his life,  
Manacle his soul upon the Red Sea bottom.
