### AN APPOINTMENT

BEING out of heart with government  
I took a broken root to fling  
Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,  
Taking delight that he could spring;  
And he, with that low whinnying sound  
That is like laughter, sprang again  
And so to the other tree at a bound.  
Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,  
Nor heavy knitting of the brow  
Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb  
And threw him up to laugh on the bough;  
No government appointed him.
