### TOWARDS BREAK OF DAY

Was it the double of my dream  
The woman that by me lay  
Dreamed, or did we halve a dream  
Under the first cold gleam of day?

I thought: "There is a waterfall  
Upon Ben Bulben side,  
That all my childhood counted dear;  
Were I to travel far and wide  
I could not find a thing so dear."  
My memories had magnified  
So many times childish delight.

I would have touched it like a child  
But knew my finger could but have touched  
Cold stone and water. I grew wild  
Even accusing heaven because  
It had set down among its laws:  
Nothing that we love over-much  
Is ponderable to our touch.

I dreamed towards break of day,  
The cold blown spray in my nostril. <span id="page_343">p. 343</span>  
But she that beside me lay  
Had watched in bitterer sleep  
The marvellous stag of Arthur,  
That lofty white stag, leap  
From mountain steep to steep.
