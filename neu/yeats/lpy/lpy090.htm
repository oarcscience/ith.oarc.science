<p>"<i>THOUGH to my feathers in the wet,<br> I have stood here from break of day,<br> I have not found a thing to eat<br> For only rubbish comes my way.<br> Am I to live on lebeen-lone?</i>"<br> <i>Muttered the old crane of Gort</i>.<br> "<i>For all my pains on lebeen-lone</i>."</p>  
<p>King Guari walked amid his court<br> The palace-yard and river-side<br> And there to three old beggars said:<br> "You that have wandered far and wide<br> Can ravel out what's in my head.<br> Do men who least desire get most,<br> Or get the most who most desire?"<br> A beggar said: "They get the most<br> Whom man or devil cannot tire,<br> And what could make their muscles taut<br> Unless desire had made them so."<br> But Guari laughed with secret thought,<br> "If that be true as it seems true,<br> One of you three is a rich man,<br> For he shall have a thousand pounds<br> Who is first asleep, if but he can <A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A><br> Sleep before the third noon sounds."<br> And thereon merry as a bird,<br> With his old thoughts King Guari went<br> From river-side and palace-yard<br> And left them to their argument.<br> "And if I win," one beggar said,<br> "Though I am old I shall persuade<br> A pretty girl to share my bed";<br> The second: "I shall learn a trade";<br> The third: "I'll hurry to the course<br> Among the other gentlemen,<br> And lay it all upon a horse ";<br> The second: "I have thought again:<br> A farmer has more dignity."<br> One to another sighed and cried:<br> The exorbitant dreams of beggary,<br> That idleness had borne to pride,<br> Sang through their teeth from noon to noon;<br> And when the second twilight brought<br> The frenzy of the beggars' moon<br> None closed his blood-shot eyes but sought<br> To keep his fellows from their sleep;<br> All shouted till their anger grew<br> And they were whirling in a heap.</p>  
<p>They mauled and bit the whole night through;<br> They mauled and bit till the day shone;<br> They mauled and bit through all that day<br> And till another night had gone,<br> Or if they made a moment's stay <A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A><br> They sat upon their heels to rail,<br> And when old Guari came and stood<br> Before the three to end this tale,<br> They were commingling lice and blood.<br> "Time's up," he cried, and all the three<br> With blood-shot eyes upon him stared.<br> "Time's up," he cried, and all the three<br> Fell down upon the dust and snored.</p>  
<p><i>"Maybe I shall be lucky yet,<br> Now they are silent," said the crane.<br> "Though to my feathers in the wet<br> I've stood as I were made of stone<br> And seen the rubbish run about,<br> It's certain there are trout somewhere<br> And maybe I shall take a trout<br> If but I do not seem to care."</i>&nbsp;</p>
