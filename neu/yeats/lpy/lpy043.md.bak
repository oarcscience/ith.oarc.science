### THE ARROW

I THOUGHT of your beauty, and this arrow,  
Made out of a wild thought, is in my marrow.  
There's no man may look upon her, no man;  
As when newly grown to be a woman,  
Tall and noble but with face and bosom  
Delicate in colour as apple blossom.  
This beauty's kinder, yet for a reason  
I could weep that the old is out of season.
