# PREFACE

THIS book contains all poetry not in dramatic form that I have written
between my seven-and-twentieth year and the year 1921. I have included
one long poem in dramatic form, of which a much shortened version,
intended for stage representation, is in my book of plays. I have left
out nearly all the long notes which seemed necessary before the work of
various writers, but especially of my friend Lady Gregory, had made the
circumstantial origins of my verse, in ancient legend or in the legends
of the country side, familiar to readers of poetry.

THOOR BALLYLEE,  
*May* 1922.
