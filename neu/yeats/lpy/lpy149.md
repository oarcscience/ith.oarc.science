### TWO SONGS OF A FOOL

I

A SPECKLED cat and a tame hare  
Eat at my hearthstone  
And sleep there;  
And both look up to me alone  
For learning and defence  
As I look up to Providence.

I start out of my sleep to think  
Some day I may forget  
Their food and drink;  
Or, the house door left unshut,  
The hare may run till it's found  
The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.

I bear a burden that might well try  
Men that do all by rule,  
And what can I  
That am a wandering witted fool  
But pray to God that He ease  
My great responsibilities.

II

I slept on my three-legged stool by the fire,  
The speckled cat slept on my knee;  
We never thought to enquire  
Where the brown hare might be,  
And whether the door were shut.  
Who knows how she drank the wind  
Stretched up on two legs from the mat,  
Before she had settled her mind  
To drum with her heel and to leap:  
Had I but awakened from sleep  
And called her name she had heard,  
It may be, and had not stirred,  
That now, it may be, has found  
The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.
