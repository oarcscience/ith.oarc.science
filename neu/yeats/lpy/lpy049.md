### RED HANRAHAN'S SONG ABOUT IRELAND

THE old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand,  
Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand;  
Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies,  
But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes  
Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.

The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea,  
And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say.  
Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat;  
But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet  
Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan. <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare,  
For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air;  
Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood;  
But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood  
Is Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.
