### A WOMAN HOMER SUNG

IF any man drew near  
When I was young,  
I thought, "He holds her dear,"  
And shook with hate and fear.  
But oh, ’twas bitter wrong  
If he could pass her by  
With an indifferent eye.

Whereon I wrote and wrought,  
And now, being grey,  
I dream that I have brought  
To such a pitch my thought  
That coming time can say,  
"He shadowed in a glass  
What thing her body was."

For she had fiery blood  
When I was young,  
And trod so sweetly proud  
As ’twere upon a cloud,  
A woman Homer sung,  
That life and letters seem  
But an heroic dream.
