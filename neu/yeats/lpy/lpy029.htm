<p>CUMHAL called out, bending his head,<br> Till Dathi came and stood,<br> With a blink in his eyes at the cave mouth,<br> Between the wind and the wood.</p>  
<p>And Cumhal said, bending his knees,<br> "I have come by the windy way<br> To gather the half of your blessedness<br> And learn to pray when you pray.</p>  
<p>"I can bring you salmon out of the streams<br> And heron out of the skies."<br> But Dathi folded his hands and smiled<br> With the secrets of God in his eyes.</p>  
<p>And Cumhal saw like a drifting smoke<br> All manner of blessed souls,<br> Women and children, young men with books,<br> And old men with croziers and stoles.</p>  
<p>"Praise God and God's mother," Dathi said,<br> "For God and God's mother have sent<br> The blessedest souls that walk in the world<br> To fill your heart with content." <A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"And which is the blessedest," Cumhal said,<br> "Where all are comely and good?<br> Is it these that with golden thuribles<br> Are singing about the wood?"</p>  
<p>"My eyes are blinking," Dathi said,<br> "With the secrets of God half blind,<br> But I can see where the wind goes<br> And follow the way of the wind;</p>  
<p>"And blessedness goes where the wind goes,<br> And when it is gone we are dead;<br> I see the blessedest soul in the world<br> And he nods a drunken head.</p>  
<p>"O blessedness comes in the night and the day<br> And whither the wise heart knows;<br> And one has seen in the redness of wine<br> The Incorruptible Rose,</p>  
<p>"That drowsily drops faint leaves on him<br> And the sweetness of desire,<br> While time and the world are ebbing away<br> In twilights of dew and of fire."</p>
