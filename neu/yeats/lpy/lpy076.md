### AT GALWAY RACES

THERE where the course is,  
Delight makes all of the one mind,  
The riders upon the galloping horses,  
The crowd that closes in behind:  
We, too, had good attendance once,  
Hearers and hearteners of the work;  
Aye, horsemen for companions,  
Before the merchant and the clerk  
Breathed on the world with timid breath.  
Sing on: sometime, and at some new moon,  
We'll learn that sleeping is not death,  
Hearing the whole earth change its tune,  
Its flesh being wild, and it again  
Crying aloud as the racecourse is,  
And we find hearteners among men  
That ride upon horses.
