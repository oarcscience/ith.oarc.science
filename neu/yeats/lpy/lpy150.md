### ANOTHER SONG OF A FOOL

THIS great purple butterfly,  
In the prison of my hands,  
Has a learning in his eye  
Not a poor fool understands.

Once he lived a schoolmaster  
With a stark, denying look,  
A string of scholars went in fear  
Of his great birch and his great book.

Like the clangour of a bell,  
Sweet and harsh, harsh and sweet,  
That is how he learnt so well  
To take the roses for his meat.
