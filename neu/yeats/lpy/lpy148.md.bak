### THE SAINT AND THE HUNCHBACK

HUNCHBACK

STAND Up and lift your hand and bless  
A man that finds great bitterness  
In thinking of his lost renown.  
A Roman Caesar is held down  
Under this hump.

SAINT

God tries each man  
According to a different plan.  
I shall not cease to bless because  
I lay about me with the taws  
That night and morning I may thrash  
Greek Alexander from my flesh,  
Augustus Caesar, and after these  
That great rogue Alcibiades.

HUNCHBACK

To all that in your flesh have stood  
And blessed, I give my gratitude,  
Honoured by all in their degrees,  
But most to Alcibiades.
