# Later Poems

## by William Butler Yeats

#### \[1922\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Yeat's own anthology of his poetry, based on the 1922 edition,
which just meets the pre-1923 requirement for public domain books in the
US. This version includes some of his best known work, including
[Easter, 1916](lpy156) ('A terrible beauty is born'.md), and [The Second
Coming](lpy163.md) ('What rough beast slouches toward Bethlehem...to be
born'). Simultaneously hypermodern and bardic, Yeats' poetry speaks to
the 21st century with authenticity and mystical clarity.
