### HIS DREAM

I SWAYED upon the gaudy stern  
The butt end of a steering oar,  
And saw wherever I could turn  
A crowd upon a shore.

And though I would have hushed the crowd,  
There was no mother's son but said,  
"What is the figure in a shroud  
Upon a gaudy bed?"

And after running at the brim  
Cried out upon that thing beneath,  
--It had such dignity of limb--  
By the sweet name of Death.

Though I'd my finger on my lip,  
What could I but take up the song?  
And running crowd and gaudy ship  
Cried out the whole night long,

Crying amid the glittering sea,  
Naming it with ecstatic breath,  
Because it had such dignity  
By the sweet name of Death.
