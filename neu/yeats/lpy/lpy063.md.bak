### RECONCILIATION

SOME may have blamed you that you took away  
The verses that could move them on the day  
When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind  
With lightning you went from me, and I could find  
Nothing to make a song about but kings,  
Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things  
That were like memories of you--but now  
We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;  
And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,  
Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.  
But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,  
My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.
