### THE MOUNTAIN TOMB

POUR wine and dance if Manhood still have pride,  
Bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom;  
The cataract smokes upon the mountain side,  
Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.

Pull down the blinds, bring fiddle and clarionet  
That there be no foot silent in the room  
Nor mouth from kissing, nor from wine unwet;  
Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.

In vain, in vain; the cataract still cries  
The everlasting taper lights the gloom;  
All wisdom shut into his onyx eyes  
Our Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb.
