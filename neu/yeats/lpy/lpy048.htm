<p>WE sat together at one summer's end,<br> That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,<br> And you and I, and talked of poetry.</p>  
<p>I said: "A line will take us hours maybe;<br> Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,<br> Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.<br> Better go down upon your marrow bones<br> And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones<br> Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;<br> For to articulate sweet sounds together<br> Is to work harder than all these, and yet<br> Be thought an idler by the noisy set<br> Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen<br> The martyrs call the world."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon<br> That beautiful mild woman for whose sake<br> There's many a one shall find out all heartache <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A><br> On finding that her voice is sweet and low<br> Replied: "To be born woman is to know,<br> Although they do not talk of it at school--<br> That we must labour to be beautiful."</p>  
<p>I said: "It's certain there is no fine thing<br> Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.<br> There have been lovers who thought love should be<br> So much compounded of high courtesy<br> That they would sigh and quote with learned looks<br> Precedents out of beautiful old books;<br> Yet now it seems an idle trade enough."</p>  
<p>We sat grown quiet at the name of love;<br> We saw the last embers of daylight die,<br> And in the trembling blue-green of the sky<br> A moon, worn as if it had been a shell<br> Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell<br> About the stars and broke in days and years.</p>  
<p>I had a thought for no one's but your ears;<br> That you were beautiful, and that I strove<br> To love you in the old high way of love;<br> That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown<br> As weary hearted as that hollow moon.</p>
