<p>"THOUGH logic choppers rule the town,<br> And every man and maid and boy<br> Has marked a distant object down,<br> An aimless joy is a pure joy,"<br> Or so did Tom O'Roughley say<br> That saw the surges running by,<br> "And wisdom is a butterfly<br> And not a gloomy bird of prey.</p>  
<p>"If little planned is little sinned<br> But little need the grave distress.<br> What's dying but a second wind?<br> How but in zig-zag wantonness<br> Could trumpeter Michael be so brave?"<br> Or something of that sort he said,<br> "And if my dearest friend were dead<br> I'd dance a measure on his grave."</p>
