### A SONG FROM THE PLAYER QUEEN

My mother dandled me and sang,  
"How young it is, how young!"  
And made a golden cradle  
That on a willow swung.

"He went away," my mother sang,  
"When I was brought to bed,"  
And all the while her needle pulled  
The gold and silver thread.

She pulled the thread and bit the thread  
And made a golden gown,  
And wept because she had dreamt that I  
Was born to wear a crown.

"When she was got," my mother sang,  
"I heard a sea-mew cry,  
And saw a flake of the yellow foam  
That dropped upon my thigh."

How therefore could she help but braid  
The gold into my hair,  
And dream that I should carry  
The golden top of care?
