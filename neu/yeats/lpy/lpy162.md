### DEMON AND BEAST

FOR certain minutes at the least  
That crafty demon and that loud beast  
That plague me day and night  
Ran out of my sight;  
Though I had long pernned in the gyre,  
Between my hatred and desire,  
I saw my freedom won  
And all laugh in the sun.

The glittering eyes in a death's head  
Of old Luke Wadding's portrait said  
Welcome, and the Ormonds all  
Nodded upon the wall,  
And even Stafford smiled as though  
It made him happier to know  
I understood his plan.  
Now that the loud beast ran  
There was no portrait in the Gallery  
But beckoned to sweet company,  
For all men's thoughts grew clear  
Being dear as mine are dear.

But soon a tear-drop started up  
For aimless joy had made me stop <span id="page_345">p. 345</span>  
Beside the little lake  
To watch a white gull take  
A bit of bread thrown up into the air;  
Now gyring down and pernning there  
He splashed where an absurd  
Portly green-pated bird  
Shook off the water from his back;  
Being no more demoniac  
A stupid happy creature  
Could rouse my whole nature.

Yet I am certain as can be  
That every natural victory  
Belongs to beast or demon,  
That never yet had freeman  
Right mastery of natural things,  
And that mere growing old, that brings  
Chilled blood, this sweetness brought;  
Yet have no dearer thought  
Than that I may find out a way  
To make it linger half a day.

O what a sweetness strayed  
Through barren Thebaid,  
Or by the Mareotic sea  
When that exultant Anthony  
And twice a thousand more  
Starved upon the shore  
And withered to a bag of bones:  
What had the Caesars but their thrones?
