<p align="center">I</p>  
<p align="center">HER COURTESY</p>  
<p>WITH the old kindness, the old distinguished grace<br> She lies, her lovely piteous head amid dull red hair<br> Propped upon pillows, rouge on the pallor of her face.<br> She would not have us sad because she is lying there,<br> And when she meets our gaze her eyes are laughter-lit,<br> Her speech a wicked tale that we may vie with her<br> Matching our broken-hearted wit against her wit,<br> Thinking of saints and of Petronius Arbiter.</p>  
<p align="center">II</p>  
<p align="center">CERTAIN ARTISTS BRING HER DOLLS AND DRAWINGS</p>  
<p>Bring where our Beauty lies<br> A new modelled doll, or drawing, <A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A><br> With a friend's or an enemy's<br> Features, or maybe showing<br> Her features when a tress<br> Of dull red hair was flowing<br> Over some silken dress<br> Cut in the Turkish fashion,<br> Or it may be like a boy's.<br> We have given the world our passion,<br> We have naught for death but toys.</p>  
<p align="center">III</p>  
<p align="center">SHE TURNS THE DOLLS' FACES TO THE WALL</p>  
<p>Because to-day is some religious festival<br> They had a priest say Mass, and even the Japanese,<br> Heel up and weight on toe, must face the wall<br> --Pedant in passion, learned in old courtesies,<br> Vehement and witty she had seemed--; the Venetian lady<br> Who had seemed to glide to some intrigue in her red shoes,<br> Her domino, her panniered skirt copied from Longhi;<br> The meditative critic; all are on their toes, <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A><br> Even our Beauty with her Turkish trousers on.<br> Because the priest must have like every dog his day<br> Or keep us all awake with baying at the moon,<br> We and our dolls being but the world were best away.</p>  
<p align="center">IV</p>  
<p align="center">THE END OF DAY</p>  
<p>She is playing like a child<br> And penance is the play,<br> Fantastical and wild<br> Because the end of day<br> Shows her that some one soon<br> Will come from the house, and say--<br> Though play is but half-done--<br> "Come in and leave the play."</p>  
<p align="center">V</p>  
<p align="center">HER RACE</p>  
<p>She has not grown uncivil<br> As narrow natures would<br> And called the pleasures evil<br> Happier days thought good; <A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A><br> She knows herself a woman<br> No red and white of a face,<br> Or rank, raised from a common<br> Unreckonable race;<br> And how should her heart fail her<br> Or sickness break her will<br> With her dead brother's valour<br> For an example still.</p>  
<p align="center">VI</p>  
<p align="center">HER COURAGE</p>  
<p>When her soul flies to the predestined dancing-place<br> (I have no speech but symbol, the pagan speech I made<br> Amid the dreams of youth) let her come face to face,<br> Amid that first astonishment, with Grania's shade<br> All but the terrors of the woodland flight forgot<br> That made her Dermuid dear, and some old cardinal<br> Pacing with half-closed eyelids in a sunny spot<br> Who had murmured of Giorgione at his latest breath-- <A NAME="page_294"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 294</FONT></A><br> Aye and Achilles, Timor, Babar, Barhaim all<br> Who have lived in joy and laughed into the face of Death.</p>  
<p align="center">VII</p>  
<p align="center">HER FRIENDS BRING HER A CHRISTMAS TREE</p>  
<p>Pardon great enemy,<br> Without an angry thought<br> We've carried in our tree,<br> And here and there have bought<br> Till all the boughs are gay,<br> And she may look from the bed<br> On pretty things that may<br> Please a fantastic head.<br> Give her a little grace,<br> What if a laughing eye<br> Have looked into your face--<br> It is about to die.</p>
