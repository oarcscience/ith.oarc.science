### THE SONG OF THE OLD MOTHER

I RISE in the dawn, and I kneel and blow  
Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;  
And then I must scrub and bake and sweep  
Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;  
And the young lie long and dream in their bed  
Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,  
And their day goes over in idleness,  
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:  
While I must work because I am old,  
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.
