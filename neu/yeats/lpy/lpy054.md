### THE PLAYERS ASK FOR A BLESSING ON THE PSALTERIES AND ON THEMSELVES

*Three voices together*:

HURRY to bless the hands that play,  
The mouths that speak, the notes and strings,  
O masters of the glittering town!  
O ! lay the shrilly trumpet down,  
Though drunken with the flags that sway  
Over the ramparts and the towers,  
And with the waving of your wings.

*First voice*:

Maybe they linger by the way.  
One gathers up his purple gown;  
One leans and mutters by the wall--  
He dreads the weight of mortal hours.

*Second voice*:

O no, O no! they hurry down  
Like plovers that have heard the call.

*Third voice*:

O kinsmen of the Three in One,  
O kinsmen bless the hands that play.  
The notes they waken shall live on  
When all this heavy history's done;  
Our hands, our hands must ebb away.

*Three voices together*:

The proud and careless notes live on  
But bless our hands that ebb away.
