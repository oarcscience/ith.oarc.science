### BAILE AND AILLINN

<div align="center">

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| *Argument*. Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but Aengus, the Master of Love, wishing them to be happy in his own land among the dead, told to each a story of the other's death, so that their hearts were broken and they died. |

</div>

*I HARDLY hear the curlew cry,  
Nor the grey rush when the wind is high,  
Before my thoughts begin to run  
On the heir of Ulad, Buan's son,  
Baile, who had the honey mouth;  
And that mild woman of the south,  
Aillinn, who was King Lugaid's heir.  
Their love was never drowned in care  
Of this or that thing, nor grew cold  
Because their bodies had grown old.  
Being forbid to marry on earth,  
They blossomed to immortal mirth*.

About the time when Christ was born,  
When the long wars for the White Horn  
And the Brown Bull had not yet come,  
Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some  
Called rather Baile Little-Land,  
Rode out of Emain with a band  
Of harpers and young men; and they  
Imagined, as they struck the way <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>  
To many-pastured Muirthemne,  
That all things fell out happily,  
And there, for all that fools had said,  
Baile and Aillinn would be wed.

They found an old man running there:  
He had ragged long grass-coloured hair;  
He had knees that stuck out of his hose;  
He had puddle water in his shoes;  
He had half a cloak to keep him dry,  
Although he had a squirrel's eye.

*O wandering birds and rushy beds,  
You put such folly in our heads  
With all this crying in the wind;  
No common love is to our mind,  
And our poor Kate or Nan is less  
Than any whose unhappiness  
Awoke the harp-strings long ago.  
Yet they that know all things but know  
That all life had to give us is  
A child's laughter, a woman's kiss.  
Who was it put so great a scorn  
In the grey reeds that night and morn  
Are trodden and broken by the herds,  
And in the light bodies of birds  
That north wind tumbles to and fro  
And pinches among hail and snow?* 

That runner said: "I am from the south;  
I run to Baile Honey-Mouth, <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>  
To tell him how the girl Aillinn  
Rode from the country of her kin,  
And old and young men rode with her:  
For all that country had been astir  
If anybody half as fair  
Had chosen a husband anywhere  
But where it could see her every day.  
When they had ridden a little way  
An old man caught the horse's head  
With: 'You must home again, and wed  
With somebody in your own land.'  
A young man cried and kissed her hand,  
'O lady, wed with one of us';  
And when no face grew piteous  
For any gentle thing she spake,  
She fell and died of the heart-break."

Because a lover's heart's worn out,  
Being tumbled and blown about  
By its own blind imagining,  
And will believe that anything  
That is bad enough to be true, is true,  
Baile's heart was broken in two;  
And he being laid upon green boughs,  
Was carried to the goodly house  
Where the Hound of Ulad sat before  
The brazen pillars of his door,  
His face bowed low to weep the end  
Of the harper's daughter and her friend.  
For although years had passed away  
He always wept them on that day, <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>  
For on that day they had been betrayed;  
And now that Honey-Mouth is laid  
Under a cairn of sleepy stone  
Before his eyes, he has tears for none,  
Although he is carrying stone, but two  
For whom the cairn's but heaped anew.

*We hold because our memory is  
So full of that thing and of this  
That out of sight is out of mind.  
But the grey rush under the wind  
And the grey bird with crooked bill  
Have such long memories, that they still  
Remember Deirdre and her man;  
And when we walk with Kate or Nan  
About the windy water side,  
Our heart can hear the voices chide.  
How could we be so soon content,  
Who know the way that Naoise went  
And they have news of Deirdre's eyes,  
Who being lovely was so wise--  
Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise*.

Now had that old gaunt crafty one,  
Gathering his cloak about him, run  
Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids,  
Who amid leafy lights and shades  
Dreamed of the hands that would unlace  
Their bodices in some dim place  
When they had come to the marriage bed;  
And harpers, pacing with high head <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>  
As though their music were enough  
To make the savage heart of love  
Grow gentle without sorrowing,  
Imagining and pondering  
Heaven knows what calamity;

"Another's hurried off," cried he,  
From heat and cold and wind and wave;  
They have heaped the stones above his grave  
In Muirthemne, and over it  
In changeless Ogham letters writ--  
*Baile, that was of Rury's seed*.  
But the gods long ago decreed  
No waiting maid should ever spread  
Baile and Aillinn's marriage bed,  
For they should clip and clip again  
Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.  
Therefore it is but little news  
That put this hurry in my shoes."

Then seeing that he scarce had spoke  
Before her love-worn heart had broke,  
He ran and laughed until he came  
To that high hill the herdsmen name  
The Hill Seat of Leighin, because  
Some god or king had made the laws  
That held the land together there,  
In old times among the clouds of the air.

That old man climbed; the day grew dim;  
Two swans came flying up to him, <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>  
Linked by a gold chain each to each,  
And with low murmuring laughing speech  
Alighted on the windy grass.  
They knew him: his changed body was  
Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings  
Were hovering over the harp-strings  
That Etain, Midhir's wife, had wove  
In the hid place, being crazed by love.

What shall I call them? fish that swim,  
Scale rubbing scale where light is dim  
By a broad water-lily leaf;  
Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf  
Forgotten at the threshing place;  
Or birds lost in the one clear space  
Of morning light in a dim sky;  
Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye,  
Or the door pillars of one house,  
Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs  
That have one shadow on the ground;  
Or the two strings that made one sound  
Where that wise harper's finger ran.  
For this young girl and this young man  
Have happiness without an end,  
Because they have made so good a friend.

They know all wonders, for they pass  
The towery gates of Gorias,  
And Findrias and Falias,  
And long-forgotten Murias,  
Among the giant kings whose hoard, <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>  
Cauldron and spear and stone and sword,  
Was robbed before earth gave the wheat;  
Wandering from broken street to street  
They come where some huge watcher is,  
And tremble with their love and kiss.

They know undying things, for they  
Wander where earth withers away,  
Though nothing troubles the great streams  
But light from the pale stars, and gleams  
From the holy orchards, where there is none  
But fruit that is of precious stone,  
Or apples of the sun and moon.

What were our praise to them? They eat  
Quiet's wild heart, like daily meat;  
Who when night thickens are afloat  
On dappled skins in a glass boat,  
Far out under a windless sky;  
While over them birds of Aengus fly,  
And over the tiller and the prow,  
And waving white wings to and fro  
Awaken wanderings of light air  
To stir their coverlet and their hair.

And poets found, old writers say,  
A yew tree where his body lay;  
But a wild apple hid the grass  
With its sweet blossom where hers was;  
And being in good heart, because  
A better time had come again <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>  
After the deaths of many men,  
And that long fighting at the ford,  
They wrote on tablets of thin board,  
Made of the apple and the yew,  
All the love stories that they knew.

*Let rush and bird cry out their fill  
Of the harper's daughter if they will,  
Beloved, I am not afraid of her.  
She is not wiser nor lovelier,  
And you are more high of heart than she,  
For all her wanderings over-sea;  
But I'd have bird and rush forget  
Those other two; for never yet  
Has lover lived, but longed to wive  
Like them that are no more alive*.
