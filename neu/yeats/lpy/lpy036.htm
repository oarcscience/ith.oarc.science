<p>WERE you but lying cold and dead,<br> And lights were paling out of the West,<br> You would come hither, and bend your head,<br> And I would lay my head on your breast;<br> And you would murmur tender words,<br> Forgiving me, because you were dead:<br> Nor would you rise and hasten away,<br> Though you have the will of the wild birds,<br> But know your hair was bound and wound<br> About the stars and moon and sun:<br> O would, beloved, that you lay<br> Under the dock-leaves in the ground,<br> While lights were paling one by one.</p>
