<p>I BRING you with reverent hands<br> The books of my numberless dreams;<br> White woman that passion has worn<br> As the tide wears the dove-grey sands,<br> And with heart more old than the horn<br> That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:<br> White woman with numberless dreams<br> I bring you my passionate rhyme.</p>
