### THE HOUR BEFORE DAWN

A CURSING rogue with a merry face,  
A bundle of rags upon a crutch,  
Stumbled upon that windy place  
Called Croghan, and it was as much  
As the one sturdy leg could do  
To keep him upright while he cursed.  
He had counted, where long years ago  
Queen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed,  
A pair of lapwings, one old sheep  
And not a house to the plain's edge,  
When close to his right hand a heap  
Of grey stones and a rocky ledge  
Reminded him that he could make,  
If he but shifted a few stones,  
A shelter till the daylight broke.

But while he fumbled with the stones  
They toppled over; "Were it not  
I have a lucky wooden shin  
I had been hurt"; and toppling brought  
Before his eyes, where stones had been,  
A dark deep hollow in the rock.  
He gave a gasp and thought to have fled, <span id="page_213">p.

Being certain it was no right rock  
Because an ancient history said  
Hell Mouth lay open near that place,  
And yet stood still, because inside  
A great lad with a beery face  
Had tucked himself away beside  
A ladle and a tub of beer,  
And snored, no phantom by his look.  
So with a laugh at his own fear  
He crawled into that pleasant nook.

"Night grows uneasy near the dawn  
Till even I sleep light; but who  
Has tired of his own company?  
What one of Maeve's nine brawling sons  
Sick of his grave has wakened me?  
But let him keep his grave for once  
That I may find the sleep I have lost."

"What care I if you sleep or wake  
But I'll have no man call me ghost."

"Say what you please, but from daybreak  
I'll sleep another century."

"And I will talk before I sleep  
And drink before I talk."  
                                And he  
Had dipped the wooden ladle deep  
Into the sleeper's tub of beer  
Had not the sleeper started up. <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

"Before you have dipped it in the beer  
I dragged from Goban's mountain-top  
I'll have assurance that you are able  
To value beer; no half-legged fool  
Shall dip his nose into my ladle  
Merely for stumbling on this hole  
In the bad hour before the dawn."

"Why, beer is only beer."  
                             "But say  
I'll sleep until the winter's gone,  
Or maybe to Midsummer Day,'  
And drink, and you will sleep that length."

"I'd like to sleep till winter's gone  
Or till the sun is in his strength.  
This blast has chilled me to the bone."

"I had no better plan at first.  
I thought to wait for that or this;  
Maybe the weather was a-cursed  
Or I had no woman there to kiss;  
So slept for half a year or so;  
But year by year I found that less  
Gave me such pleasure I'd forgo  
Even a half hour's nothingness,  
And when at one year's end I found  
I had not waked a single minute,  
I chose this burrow under ground.  
I'll sleep away all Time within it:  
My sleep were now nine centuries <span id="page_215">p. 215</span>  
But for those mornings when I find  
The lapwing at their foolish cries  
And the sheep bleating at the wind  
As when I also played the fool."

The beggar in a rage began  
Upon his hunkers in the hole,  
"It's plain that you are no right man  
To mock at everything I love  
As if it were not worth the doing.  
I'd have a merry life enough  
If a good Easter wind were blowing,  
And though the winter wind is bad  
I should not be too down in the mouth  
For anything you did or said  
If but this wind were in the south."

"You cry aloud, O would ’twere spring  
Or that the wind would shift a point,  
And do not know that you would bring,  
If time were suppler in the joint,  
Neither the spring nor the south wind  
But the hour when you shall pass away  
And leave no smoking wick behind,  
For all life longs for the Last Day  
And there's no man but cocks his ear  
To know when Michael's trumpet cries  
That flesh and bone may disappear,  
And souls as if they were but sighs,  
And there be nothing but God left;  
But I alone being blessed keep <span id="page_216">p. 216</span>  
Like some old rabbit to my cleft  
And wait Him in a drunken sleep."  
He dipped his ladle in the tub  
And drank and yawned and stretched him out.  
The other shouted, "You would rob  
My life of every pleasant thought  
And every comfortable thing  
And so take that and that." Thereon  
He gave him a great pummelling,  
But might have pummelled at a stone  
For all the sleeper knew or cared;  
And after heaped up stone on stone,  
And then, grown weary, prayed and cursed  
And heaped upon stone on stone again,  
And prayed and cursed and cursed and fled  
From Maeve and all that juggling plain,  
Nor gave God thanks till overhead  
The clouds were brightening with the dawn.
