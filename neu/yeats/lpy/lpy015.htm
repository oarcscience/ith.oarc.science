<p>Do you not hear me calling, white deer with no horns!<br> I have been changed to a hound with one red ear;<br> I have been in the Path of Stones and the Wood of Thorns,<br> For somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear<br> Under my feet that they follow you night and day.<br> A man with a hazel wand came without sound;<br> He changed me suddenly; I was looking another way;<br> And now my calling is but the calling of a hound;<br> And Time and Birth and Change are hurrying by. <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A><br> I would that the Boar without bristles had come from the West<br> And had rooted the sun and moon and stars out of the sky<br> And lay in the darkness, grunting, and turning to his rest.</p>
