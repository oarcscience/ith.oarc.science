### THE FOLLY OF BEING COMFORTED

ONE that is ever kind said yesterday:  
"Your well-beloved's hair has threads of grey,  
And little shadows come about her eyes;  
Time can but make it easier to be wise  
Though now it seem impossible, and so  
Patience is all that you have need of."  
                                         No,  
I have not a crumb of comfort, not a grain,  
Time can but make her beauty over again:  
Because of that great nobleness of hers  
The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs  
Burns but more clearly. O she had not these ways,  
When all the wild summer was in her gaze.  
O heart! O heart! if she'd but turn her head,  
You'd know the folly of being comforted.
