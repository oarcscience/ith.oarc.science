<p>O'DRISCOLL drove with a song<br> The wild duck and the drake<br> From the tall and the tufted reeds<br> Of the drear Hart Lake.</p>  
<p>And he saw how the reeds grew dark<br> At the coming of night tide,<br> And dreamed of the long dim hair<br> Of Bridget his bride.</p>  
<p>He heard while he sang and dreamed<br> A piper piping away,<br> And never was piping so sad,<br> And never was piping so gay.</p>  
<p>And he saw young men and young girls<br> Who danced on a level place<br> And Bridget his bride among them,<br> With a sad and a gay face.</p>  
<p>The dancers crowded about him,<br> And many a sweet thing said,<br> And a young man brought him red wine<br> And a young girl white bread.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But Bridget drew him by the sleeve,<br> Away from the merry bands,<br> To old men playing at cards<br> With a twinkling of ancient hands.</p>  
<p>The bread and the wine had a doom,<br> For these were the host of the air;<br> He sat and played in a dream<br> Of her long dim hair.</p>  
<p>He played with the merry old men<br> And thought not of evil chance,<br> Until one bore Bridget his bride<br> Away from the merry dance.</p>  
<p>He bore her away in his arms,<br> The handsomest young man there,<br> And his neck and his breast and his arms<br> Were drowned in her long dim hair.</p>  
<p>O'Driscoll scattered the cards<br> And out of his dream awoke:<br> Old men and young men and young girls<br> Were gone like a drifting smoke;</p>  
<p>But he heard high up in the air<br> A piper piping away,<br> And never was piping so sad,<br> And never was piping so gay.</p>
