### KING O'TOOLE AND HIS GOOSE

S. Lover

"By Gor, I thought all the world, far and near, heerd o' King
O'Toole-well, well, but the darkness of mankind is ontellible! Well,
sir, you must know, as you didn't hear it afore, that there was a king
called King O'Toole, who was

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

a fine ould king in the ould ancient times, long ago; and it was him
that owned the churches in the early days. The king, you see, was the
right sort; he was the rale boy, and loved sport as he loved his life,
and huntin' in partic'lar; and from the risin' o' the sun, up he got,
and away he wint over the mountains beyant afther the deer; and the fine
times them wor.

"Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the king had his health; but,
you see, in coorse of time the king grew ould, by raison he was stiff in
his limbs, and when he got sthriken in years, his heart failed him, and
he was lost intirely for want o' divarshin, bekase he couldn't go a
huntin' no longer; and, by dad, the poor king was obleeged at last for
to get a goose to divart him. Oh, you may laugh, if you like, but it's
truth I'm tellin' you; and the way the goose divarted him was
this-a-way: You see, the goose used for to swim acrass the lake, and go
divin' for throut, and cotch fish on a Friday for the king, and flew
every other day round about the lake, divartin' the poor king. All went
on mighty well, antil, by dad, the goose got sthriken in years like her
master, and couldn't divart him no longer, and then it was that the poor
king was lost complate. The king was walkin' one mornin' by the edge of
the lake lamentin' his cruel fate, and thinkin' o' drownin' himself,
that could get no divarshun in life, when all of a suddint, turnin'
round the corner beyant, who should he meet but a mighty dacent young
man comin' up to him.

"'God save you,' says the king to the young man.

"'God save you kindly, King O'Toole,' says the young man. Thrue for
you,' says the king. 'I am King O'Toole,' says he, prince and
plennypennytinchery o' these parts,' says he; 'but how kem ye to know
that? says he, 'Oh, never mind,' says Saint Kavin.

"You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough--the saint himself in disguise,
and nobody else. 'Oh, never mind,' says he, 'I know more than that. May
I make bowld to ax how is your goose, King O'Toole?' says he.
'Blur-an-agers, how kem ye to know about my goose?' says

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the king. 'Oh, no matther; I was given to understand it,' says Saint
Kavin. After some more talk the king says, 'What are you?' 'I'm an
honest man,' says Saint Kavin. 'Well, honest man,' says the king, 'and
how is it you make your money so aisy?' 'By makin' ould things as good
as new,' says Saint Kavin. 'Is it a tinker you are?' says the king.
'No,' says the saint; 'I'm no tinker by thrade, King O'Toole; I've a
betther thrade than a tinker,' says he--'what would you say,' says he,
'if I made your ould goose as good as new?'

"My dear, at the word o' making his goose as good as new, you'd think
the poor ould king's eyes was ready to jump out iv his head. With that
the king whistled, and down kem the poor goose, all as one as a hound,
waddlin' up to the poor cripple, her masther, and as like him as two
pays. The minute the saint clapt his eyes on the goose, 'I'll do the job
for you,' says he, 'King O'Toole.' 'By *Jaminee*!' says King O'Toole,
'if you do, bud I'll say you're the cleverest fellow in the sivin
parishes.' 'Oh, by dad,' says Saint Kavin, 'you must say more nor
that--my horn's not so soft all out,' says he, 'as to repair your ould
goose for nothin'; what'll you gi' me if I do the job for you?--that's
the chat,' says Saint Kavin. 'I'll give you whatever you ax,' says the
king; 'isn't that fair?' 'Divil a fairer,' says the saint; 'that's the
way to do business. Now,' says he, 'this is the bargain I'll make with
you, King O'Toole: will you gi' me all the ground the goose flies over,
the first offer, afther I make her as good as new?' 'I will,' says the
king. 'You won't go back o' your word?' says Saint Kavin. 'Honour
bright!' says King O'Toole, howldin' out his fist. 'Honour bright! says
Saint Kavin, back agin, "it's a bargain. Come here!' says he to the poor
ould goose--'come here, you unfort'nate ould cripple, and it's I that'll
make you the sportin' bird.' With that, my dear, he took up the goose by
the two wings--'Criss o' my crass an you,' says he, markin' her to grace
with the blessed sign at the same minute--and throwin' her up in the
air, 'whew,' says he, jist givin' her a blast to help her; and with
that, my jewel, she tuk to her

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

heels, flyin' like one o' the aigles themselves, and cuttin' as many
capers as a swallow before a shower of rain.

"Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the king standin' with
his mouth open, lookin' at his poor ould goose flyin' as light as a
lark, and betther nor ever she was: and when she lit at his fut, patted
her an the head, and, '*Ma vourneen*,' says he, 'but you are the
*darlint* o' the world.' 'And what do you say to me,' says Saint Kavin,
'for makin' her the like?' 'By gor,' says the king, 'I say nothin' bates
the art o' man, barrin' the bees.' 'And do you say no more nor that?'
says Saint Kavin. 'And that I'm behoulden to you,' says the king. 'But
will you gi'e me all the ground the goose flew over?' says Saint Kavin.
'I will,' says King O'Toole, 'and you're welkim to it,' says he, 'though
it's the last acre I have to give.' 'But you'll keep your word thrue?'
says the saint. 'As thrue as the sun,' says the king. 'It's well for
you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,' says he; 'for if you didn't
say that word, *the devil receave the bit o' your goose id ever fly
agin*.' Whin the king was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was *plazed*
with him, and thin it was that he made himself known to the king. 'And,'
says he, 'King O'Toole, you're a decent man, for I only kem here to
*thry you*. You don't know me,' says he, 'bekase I'm disguised.' 'Musha!
thin,' says the king, 'who are you? 'I'm Saint Kavin,' said the saint,
blessin' himself. 'Oh, queen iv heaven!' says the king, makin' the sign
o' the crass betune his eyes, and fallin' down on his knees before the
saint; 'is it the great Saint Kavin,' says he, 'that I've been
discoorsin' an this time without knowin' it,' says he, 'all as one as if
he was a lump iv a *gossoon*?--and so you're a saint?' says the king. 'I
am,' says Saint Kavin. 'By gor, I thought I was only talking to a dacent
boy,' says the king. 'Well, you know the differ now,' says the saint.
'I'm Saint Kavin,' says he, 'the greatest of all the saints.' And so the
king had his goose as good as new, to divart him as long as he lived:
and the saint supported him afther he kem into his property, as I tould

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

you, until the day iv his death--and that was soon afther; for the poor
goose thought he was ketchin' a throut one Friday; but, my jewel, it was
a mistake he made--and instead of a throut, it was a thievin' horse-eel;
and by gor, instead iv the goose killin' a throut for the king's
supper,--by dad, the eel killed the king's goose-and small blame to him;
but he didn't ate her, bekase he darn't ate what Saint Kavin laid his
blessed hands on."
