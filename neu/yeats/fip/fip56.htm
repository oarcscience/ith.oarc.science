<P>On the ocean that hollows the rocks where ye dwell,<BR>
A shadowy land has appeared, as they tell;<BR>
Men thought it a region of sunshine and rest,<BR>
And they called it <I>Hy-Brasail</I>, the isle of the blest.<BR>
From year unto year on the ocean's blue rim,<BR>
The beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim;<BR>
The golden clouds curtained the deep where it lay,<BR>
And it looked like an Eden, away, far away!</P>
<P>A peasant who heard of the wonderful tale,<BR>
In the breeze of the Orient loosened his sail;<BR>
From Ara, the holy, he turned to the west,<BR>
For though Ara was holy, <I>Hy-Brasail</I> was blest.<BR>
He heard not the voices that called from the shore--<BR>
He heard not the rising wind's menacing roar;<BR>
Home, kindred, and safety, he left on that day,<BR>
And he sped to <I>Hy-Brasail</I>, away, far away!</P>
<P>Morn rose on the deep, and that shadowy isle,<BR>
O'er the faint rim of distance, reflected its smile;<BR>
Noon burned on the wave, and that shadowy shore<BR>
Seemed lovelily distant, and faint as before;<BR>
Lone evening came down on the wanderer's track,<BR>
And to Ara again he looked timidly back;<BR>
Oh! far on the verge of the ocean it lay,<BR>
Yet the isle of the blest was away, far away!</P>
<P>Rash dreamer, return! O, ye winds of the main,<BR>
Bear him back to his own peaceful Ara again.<BR>
Rash fool! for a vision of fanciful bliss,<BR>
To barter thy calm life of labour and peace.<BR>
The warning of reason was spoken in vain;<BR>
He never revisited Ara again!<BR>
Night fell on the deep, amidst tempest and spray,<BR>
And he died on the waters, away, far away!</P>
