This is an anthology of Irish folklore, edited by W. B. Yeats. Many of
these stories are from books which are archived at this site; some are
from books which have yet to be converted to etext or now-rare source
material. He selected many of the best (and often funniest) tales from
other writers such as Lady Wilde, Croker, Lover, Hyde, and Carelton.
Yeats wrote introductory material and notes to many of these stories.
