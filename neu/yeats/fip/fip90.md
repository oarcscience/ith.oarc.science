### FATHER JOHN O'HART.--Page [220](fip59.htm#page_220).

Father O'Rorke is the priest of the parishes of Ballysadare and
Kilvamet, and it is from his learnedly and faithfully and
sympathetically written history of these parishes that I have taken the
story of Father John, who had been priest of these parishes, dying in
the year 1739. Coloony is a village in Kilvamet.

Some sayings of Father John's have come down. Once when he was sorrowing
greatly for the death of his brother, the people said to him, "Why do
you sorrow so for your brother, when you forbid us to keen?" "Nature,"
he answered, "forces me, but ye force nature." His memory and influence
survives, in the fact that to the present day there has been no keening
in Coloony.

He was a friend of the celebrated poet and musician, Carolan.
