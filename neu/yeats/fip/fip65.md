### THE LONG SPOON <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56)

Patrick Kennedy

The devil and the hearth-money collector for Bantry set out one summer
morning to decide a bet they made the night before over a jug of punch.
They wanted to see which would have the best load at sunset, and neither
was to pick up anything that wasn't offered with the good-will of the
giver. They passed by a house, and they heard the poor ban-a-t'yee <span

------ take you for a lazy sthronsuch <span
id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_58) of a girl! do you intend to get up today?"
"Oh, oh," says the taxman, "there's a job for you, Nick." "Ovock," says
the other, "it wasn't from her heart she said it; we must pass on." The
next cabin they were passing, the woman was on the bawnditch <span
id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_59) crying out to her husband that was mending
one of his brogues inside: "Oh, tattheration to you, Nick! you never
rung them pigs, and there they are in the potato drills rootin' away;
the ------ run to Lusk with them." "Another windfall for you," says the
man of the inkhorn, but the old thief shook his horns and wagged his
tail. So they went on, and ever so many prizes were offered to the black
fellow without him taking one. Here it was a gorsoon playing marvels
when he should be using his clappers in the corn-field; and then it was
a lazy drone of a servant asleep with his face to the sod when he ought
to be weeding. No one thought of offering the hearth-money man even a
drink of butter-milk, and at last the sun was within half a foot of the
edge of Cooliagh. They were just then passing Monamolin, and a poor
woman that was straining her supper in a skeeoge outside her cabin-door,
seeing the two standing at the bawn gate, bawled out, "Oh, here's the
hearth-money man--run away wid him." "Got a bite at

last," says Nick. "Oh, no, no! it wasn't from her heart," says the
collector. "Indeed, an' it was from the very foundation-stones it came.
No help for misfortunes; in with you," says he, opening the mouth of his
big black bag; and whether the devil was ever after seen taking the same
walk or not, nobody ever laid eyes on his fellow-traveller again.
