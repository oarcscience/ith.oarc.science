### SOLITARY FAIRIES.--Page [80](fip23.htm#page_80.md).

The trooping fairies wear green jackets, the solitary ones red. On the
red jacket of the Lepracaun, according to McAnally, are seven rows of
buttons--seven buttons in each row. On the western coast, he says, the
red jacket is covered by a frieze one, and in Ulster the creature wears
a cocked hat, and when he is up to anything unusually mischievous, he
leaps on to a wall and spins, balancing himself on the point of the hat
with his heels in the air. McAnally tells how once a peasant saw a
battle between the green jacket fairies and the red. When the green
jackets began to win, so delighted was he to see the green above the red
he gave a great shout. In a moment all vanished and he was flung into
the ditch.
