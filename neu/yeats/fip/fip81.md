### CUSHEEN LOO.--Page [33](fip09.htm#page_33.md).

Forts, otherwise raths or royalties, are circular ditches enclosing a
little field, where, in most cases, if you dig down you come to stone
chambers, their bee-hive roofs and walls made of unmortared stone. In
these little fields the ancient Celts fortified themselves and their
cattle, in winter retreating into the stone chambers, where also they
were buried. The people call them Dane's forts, from a misunderstanding
of the word Danān (Tuath-de-Danān). The fairies, have taken up their
abode therein, guarding them from all disturbance. Whoever roots them up
soon finds his cattle falling sick, or his family or himself. Near the
raths are sometimes found flint arrow-heads; these are called "fairy
darts", and are supposed to have been flung by the fairies, when angry,
at men or cattle.
