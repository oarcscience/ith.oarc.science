### THE PHANTOM ISLE

Giraldus Cambrensis <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

Among the other islands is one newly formed, which they call the Phantom
Isle, which had its origin in this manner. One calm day a large mass of
earth rose to the surface of the sea, where no land had ever been seen
before, to the great amazement of islanders who observed it. Some of
them said that it was a whale, or other immense sea-monster; others,
remarking that it continued motionless, said, "No; it is land." In
order, therefore, to reduce their doubts to certainty, some picked young
men of the island determined to approach nearer the spot in a boat.
When, however, they came so near to it that they thought they should go
on shore, the island sank in the water and entirely vanished from sight.
The next day it re-appeared, and again mocked the same youths with the
like delusion. At length, on their rowing towards it on the third day,
they followed the advice of an older man, and let fly an arrow, barbed
with red-hot steel, against the island; and then landing, found it
stationary and habitable.

This adds one to the many proofs that fire is the greatest of enemies to
every sort of phantom; in so much that those who have seen apparitions,
fall into a swoon as soon as they are sensible of the brightness of
fire. For fire, both from its position and nature, is the noblest of the
elements, being a witness of the secrets of the heavens.

The sky is fiery; the planets are fiery; the bush burnt with fire, but
was not consumed; the Holy Ghost sat upon the apostles in tongues of
fire.
