S. C. Hall's *Ireland*; Lady Chatterton's *Rambles in the South of
Ireland*; Gerald Griffin's *Tales of a Jury-room*; and the *Leadbeater

*Four Masters* are several tales. The principal magazine articles are in
the *Dublin and London Magazine* for 1825-1828 (Sir William Wilde calls
this the best collection of Irish folk-lore in existence); and in the
*Dublin University Magazine* for 1839 and 1878, those in '78 being by
Miss Maclintock. The *Folk-Lore Journal* and the *Folk-Lore Record*
contain much Irish folk-lore, as also do the *Ossianic Society's*
publications and the proceedings of the *Kilkenny Archæological
Society*. Old Irish magazines, such as the *Penny Journal*, *Newry
Magazine*, and *Duffy's Sixpenny Magazine* and *Hibernian Magazine*,
have much scattered through them. Among the peasantry are immense
quantities of ungathered legends and beliefs.
