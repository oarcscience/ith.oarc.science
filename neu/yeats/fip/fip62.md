### CONVERSION OF KING LAOGHAIR'S DAUGHTERS.

ONCE when Patrick and his clericks were sitting beside a well in the
Rath of Croghan, with books open on their knees, they saw coming towards
them the two young daughters of the King of Connaught. 'Twas early
morning, and they were going to the well to bathe.

The young girls said to Patrick, "Whence are ye, and whence come ye?"
and Patrick answered, "It were better for you to confess to the true God
than to inquire concerning our race."

"Who is God?" said the young girls, "and where is God, and of what
nature is God, and where is His dwelling-place? Has your God sons and
daughters, gold and silver? Is he everlasting? Is he beautiful? Did Mary
foster her son? Are His daughters dear and beauteous to men of the
world? Is He in heaven, or on earth, in the sea, in rivers, in
mountainous places, in valleys?"

Patrick answered them, and made known who God was, and they believed and
were baptised, and a white garment put upon their heads; and Patrick
asked them would they live on or would they die and behold the face of
Christ? They chose death, and died immediately, and were buried near the
well Clebach.
