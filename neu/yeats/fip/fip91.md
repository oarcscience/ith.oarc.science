### SHONEEN AND SLEIVEEN.--Page [220](fip59.htm#page_220).

Shoneen is the diminutive of *shone* \[Ir. *Seón*\]. There are two Irish
names for John--one is *Shone*, the other is *Shawn* \[Ir. *Seághan*\].
Shone is the "grandest" of the two, and is applied to the gentry. Hence
*Shoneen* means "a little gentry John", and is applied to upstarts and
"big" farmers, who ape the rank of gentleman.

Sleiveen, not to be found in the dictionaries, is a comical Irish word
(at least in Connaught) for a rogue. It probably comes from *sliabh*, a
mountain, meaning primarily a mountaineer, and in a secondary sense, on
the principle that mountaineers are worse than anybody else, a rogue. I
am indebted to Mr. Douglas Hyde for these details, as for many others.
