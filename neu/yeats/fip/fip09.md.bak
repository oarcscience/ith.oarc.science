### PADDY CORCORAN'S WIFE

William Carleton

Paddy Corcoran's wife was for several years afflicted with a kind of
complaint which nobody could properly understand. She was sick, and she
was not sick; she was well, and she was not well; she was as ladies wish
to be who love their lords, and she was not as such ladies wish to be.
In fact nobody could tell what the matter with her was. She had a
gnawing at the heart which came heavily upon her husband; for, with the
help of God, a keener appetite than the same gnawing amounted to could
not be

met with of a summer's day. The poor woman was delicate beyond belief,
and had no appetite at all, so she hadn't barring a little relish for a
mutton-chop, or a "staik", or a bit o' mait, anyway; for sure, God help
her! she hadn't the laist inclination for the dhry pratie, or the dhrop
o' sour buttermilk along wid it, especially as she was so poorly; and,
indeed, for a woman in her condition--for, sick as she was, poor Paddy
always was made to believe her in *that* condition--but God's will be
done! she didn't care. A pratie an' a grain o' salt was a welcome to
her--glory be to his name!--as the best roast an' boiled that ever was
dressed; and why not? There was one comfort: she wouldn't be long wid
him--long troublin' him; it matthered little what she got; but sure she
knew herself, that from the gnawin' at her heart, she could never do
good widout the little bit o' mait now and then; an', sure, if her own
husband begridged it to her, who else had she a better right to expect
it from?

Well, as we have said, she lay a bedridden invalid for long enough,
trying doctors and quacks of all sorts, sexes, and sizes, and all
without a farthing's benefit, until, at the long run, poor Paddy was
nearly brought to the last pass in striving to keep her in "the bit o'
mait". The seventh year was now on the point of closing, when, one
harvest day, as she lay bemoaning her hard condition, on her bed beyond
the kitchen fire, a little weeshy woman, dressed in a neat red cloak,
comes in, and sitting down by the hearth, says:

"Well, Kitty Corcoran, you've had a long lair of it there on the broad
o' yer back for seven years, an' you're jist as far from bein' cured as
ever."

"Mavrone, ay" said the other; "in throth that's what I was this minnit
thinkin' ov, and a sorrowful thought it's to me."

"It's yer own fau't, thin," says the little woman; "an', indeed, for
that matter, it's yer fau't that ever you wor there at all."

"Arra, how is that?" asked Kitty; "sure I wouldn't be

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

here if I could help it? Do you think it's a comfort or a pleasure to me
to be sick and bedridden?"

"No," said the other, "I do not; but I'll tell you the truth: for the
last seven years you have been annoying us. I am one o' the good people;
an' as I have a regard for you, I'm come to let you know the raison why
you've been sick so long as you are. For all the time you've been ill,
if you'll take the thrubble to remimber, your childhre threwn out yer
dirty wather afther dusk an' before sunrise, at the very time we're
passin' yer door, which we pass twice a-day. Now, if you avoid this, if
you throw it out in a different place, an' at a different time, the
complaint you have will lave you: so will the gnawin' at the heart; an'
you'll be as well as ever you wor. If you don't follow this advice, why,
remain as you are, an' all the art o' man can't cure you." She then bade
her good-bye, and disappeared.

Kitty, who was glad to be cured on such easy terms, immediately complied
with the injunction of the fairy; and the consequence was, that the next
day she found herself in as good health as ever she enjoyed during her
life.
