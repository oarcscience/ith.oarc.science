### DEMON CAT.--Page [229](fip64.htm#page_229.md).

In Ireland one hears much of Demon Cats. The father of one of the
present editors of the *Fortnightly* had such a cat, say county Dublin
peasantry. One day the priest dined with him, and objecting to see a cat
fed before Christians, said something over it that made it go up the
chimney in a flame of fire. "I will have the law on you for doing such a
thing to my cat," said the father of the editor. "Would you like to see
your cat?" said the priest. "I would," said he, and the priest brought
it up, covered with chains, through the hearth-rug, straight out of
hell. The Irish devil does not object to these undignified shapes. The
Irish devil is not a dignified person. He has no whiff of sulphureous
majesty about him. A centaur of the ragamuffin, jeering and shaking his
tatters, at once the butt and terror of the saints!
