### SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON.--Pages [13](fip06.htm#page_13) and [38](fip11.htm#page_38.md).

Many in Ireland consider Sir Samuel Ferguson their greatest poet. The
English reader will most likely never have heard his name, for
Anglo-Irish critics, who have found English audience, being more Anglo
than Irish, have been content to follow English opinion instead of
leading it, in all matters concerning Ireland.
