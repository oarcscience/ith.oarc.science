### GRACE CONNOR.

MISS LETITIA MACLINTOCK.

THADY and Grace Connor lived on the borders of a large turf bog, in the
parish of Clondevaddock, where they could hear the Atlantic surges
thunder in upon the shore, and see the wild storms of winter sweep over
the Muckish mountain,

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

and his rugged neighbours. Even in summer the cabin by the bog was dull
and dreary enough.

Thady Connor worked in the fields, and Grace made a livelihood as a
pedlar, carrying a basket of remnants of cloth, calico, drugget, and
frieze about the country. The people rarely visited any large town, and
found it convenient to buy from Grace, who was welcomed in many a lonely
house, where a table was hastily cleared, that she might display her
wares. Being considered a very honest woman, she was frequently
entrusted with commissions to the shops in Letterkenny and Ramelton. As
she set out towards home, her basket was generally laden with little
gifts for her children.

"Grace, dear," would one of the kind housewives say, "here's a
farrel <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) of oaten cake, wi' a taste o'
butter on it; tak' it wi' you for the weans;" or, "Here's half-a-dozen
of eggs; you've a big family to support."

Small Connors of all ages crowded round the weary mother, to rifle her
basket of these gifts. But her thrifty, hard life came suddenly to an
end. She died after an illness of a few hours, and was waked and buried
as handsomely as Thady could afford.

Thady was in bed the night after the funeral, and the fire still burned
brightly, when he saw his departed wife across the room and bend over
the cradle. Terrified, he muttered rapid prayers, covered his face with
the blanket; and on looking up again the appearance was gone.

Next night he lifted the infant out of the cradle, and laid it behind
him in the bed, hoping thus to escape his ghostly visitor; but Grace was
presently in the room, and stretching over him to wrap up her child.
Shrinking and shuddering, the poor man exclaimed, "Grace, woman, what is
it brings you back? What is it you want wi' me?"

"I want naething fae you, Thady, but to put thon wean back in her
cradle," replied the spectre, in a tone of scorn. "You're too feared for
me, but my sister Rose willna be

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

feared for me--tell her to meet me tomorrow evening, in the old
wallsteads."

Rose lived with her mother, about a mile off, but she obeyed her
sister's summons without the least fear, and kept the strange tryste in
due time.

"Rose, dear," she said, as she appeared before her sister in the old
wallsteads, "my mind's oneasy about them twa' red shawls that's in the
basket. Matty Hunter and Jane Taggart paid me for them, an' I bought
them wi' their money, Friday was eight days. Gie them the shawls the
morrow. An' old Mosey M'Corkell gied me the price o' a wiley coat; it's
in under the other things in the basket. An' now farewell; I can get to
my rest."

"Grace, Grace, bide a wee minute," cried the faithful sister, as the
dear voice grew fainter, and the dear face began to fade--"Grace,
darling! Thady? The children? One word mair!" but neither cries nor
tears could further detain the spirit hastening to its rest!

flat griddle cake is divided into triangular cuts, each of these cuts is
called a farrel, farli or parli.
