# THE TROOPING FAIRIES

## THE MERROW

The Merrow, of if you write it in the Irish, *Moruadh* or *Murúghach*,
from *muir*, sea, and *oigh*, a maid, is not uncommon, they say, on the
wilder coasts. The fishermen do not like to see them, for it always
means coming gales. The male *Merrows* (if you can use such a phrase--I
have never heard the masculine of Merrow) have green teeth, green hair,
pig's eyes, and red noses; but their women are beautiful, for all their
fish tails and the little duck-like scale between their fingers.
Sometimes they prefer, small blame to them, good-looking fishermen to
their sea lovers. Near Bantry in the last century, there is said to have
been a woman covered all over with scales like a fish, who was descended
from such a marriage. Sometimes they come out of the sea, and wander
about the shore in the shape of little hornless cows. They have, when in
their own shape, a red cap, called a *cohullen druith*, usually covered
with feathers. If this is stolen, they cannot again go down under the
waves.

Red is the colour of magic in every country, and has been so from the
very earliest times. The caps of fairies and magicians are well-nigh
always red.
