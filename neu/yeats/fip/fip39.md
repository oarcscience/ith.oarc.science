### THE BLACK LAMB. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17)

LADY WILDE.

It is a custom amongst the people, when throwing away water at night, to
cry out in a loud voice, "Take care of the water"; or literally, from
the Irish, "Away with yourself from the water"--for they say that the
spirits of the dead last buried are then wandering about, and it would
be dangerous if the water fell on them.

One dark night a woman suddenly threw out a pail of boiling water
without thinking of the warning words. Instantly a cry was heard, as of
a person in pain, but no one was seen. However, the next night a black
lamb entered the house, having the back all fresh scalded, and it lay
down moaning by the hearth and died. Then they all knew that this was
the spirit that had been scalded by the woman, and they carried the dead
lamb out reverently, and buried it deep in the earth. Yet every night at
the same hour it walked again into the house, and lay down, moaned, and
died; and after this had happened many times, the priest was sent for,
and finally, by the strength of his exorcism, the spirit of the dead was
laid to rest; the black lamb appeared no more. Neither was the body of
the dead lamb found in the grave when they searched for it, though it
had been laid by their own hands deep in the earth, and covered with
clay.
