### THE STOLEN CHILD.

W. B. YEATS

Where dips the rocky highland  
  Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,  
There lies a leafy island  
  Where flapping herons wake  
The drowsy water-rats.  
There we've hid our fairy vats  
Full of berries,  
And of reddest stolen cherries.  
Come away, O, human child!  
To the woods and waters wild  
With a fairy hand in hand,  
For the world's more full of weeping than  
           you can understand.

Where the wave of moonlight glosses  
  The dim grey sands with light,  
Far off by farthest Rosses  
  We foot it all the night,  
Weaving olden dances,  
Mingling hands, and mingling glances,  
  Till the moon has taken flight; <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>  
To and fro we leap,  
  And chase the frothy bubbles,  
  While the world is full of troubles  
And is anxious in its sleep.  
Come away! O, human child!  
To the woods and waters wild,  
With a fairy hand in hand,  
For the world's more full of weeping than  
           you can understand.

Where the wandering water gushes  
  From the hills above Glen-Car,  
In pools among the rushes,  
  That scarce could bathe a star,  
We seek for slumbering trout,  
  And whispering in their ears;  
    We give them evil dreams,  
Leaning softly out  
  From ferns that drop their tears  
    Of dew on the young streams.  
Come! O, human child!  
To the woods and waters wild,  
With a fairy hand in hand,  
For the world's more full of weeping then  
           you can understand.

Away with us, he's going,  
  The solemn-eyed;  
He'll hear no more the lowing  
  Of the calves on the warm hill-side.  
Or the kettle on the hob  
  Sing peace into his breast;  
Or see the brown mice bob  
  Round and round the oatmeal chest.  
For he comes, the human child,  
To the woods and waters wild,  
With a fairy hand in hand,  
For the world's more full of weeping than  
           he can understand.
