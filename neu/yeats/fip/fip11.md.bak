### THE WHITE TROUT; A LEGEND OF CONG

BY S. LOVER

There was wanst upon a time, long ago, a beautiful lady that lived in a
castle upon the lake beyant, and they say she was promised to a king's
son, and they war to be married, when all of a sudden he was murthered,
the crathur (Lord help us), and threwn into the lake above, and so, of
course, he couldn't keep his promise to the fair lady--and more's the
pity.

Well, the story goes that she went out iv her mind, bekase av loosin'
the king's son--for she was tendher-hearted, God help her, like the rest
iv us!--and pined away after him, until at last, no one about seen her,
good or bad; and the story wint that the fairies took her away.

Well, sir, in coarse a' time, the White Throut, God bless it, was seen
in the sthrame beyant, and sure the people didn't know what to think av
the crathur, seein' as how a *white* throut was never heard av afar, nor
since; and years upon years the throut was there, just where you seen it
this blessed minit, longer nor I can tell--aye throth, and beyant the
memory a' th' ouldest in the village.

At last the people began to think it must be a fairy; for what else
could it be?--and no hurt nor harm was iver put an the white throut,
until some wicked sinners of sojers kem to these parts, and laughed at
all the people, and gibed and jeered them for thinkin' a' the likes; and
one a' them in partic'lar (bad luck to him; God forgi' me for saying
it!) swore he'd catch the throut and ate it for his dinner--the
blackguard!

Well, what would you think o' the villainy of the sojer? Sure enough he
catch the throut, and away wid him home, and puts an the fryin'-pan, and
into it he pitches the purty little thing. The throut squeeled all as
one as a christian crathur, and, my dear, you'd think the sojer id split
his

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

sides laughin'--for he was a harden'd villain; and when he thought one
side was done, he turns it over to fly the other; and, what would you
think, but the divil a taste of a burn was an it all at all; and sure
the sojer thought it was a *quare* throut that could not be briled.
"But," says he, 'I'll give it another turn by-and-by," little thinkin'
what was in store for him, the haythen.

Well, when he thought that side was done he turns it agin, and lo and
behould you, the divil a taste more done that side was nor the other.
"Bad luck to me," says the sojer, "but that bates the world," says he;
"but I'll thry you agin, my darlint," says he, "as cunnin' as you think
yourself;" and so with that he turns it over, but not a sign of the fire
was on the purty throut. "Well," says the desperate villain--(for sure,
sir, only he was a desperate villain *entirely*, he might know he was
doing a wrong thing, seein' that all his endeavours was no
good)--"Well," says he, "my jolly little throut, maybe you're fried
enough, though you don't seem over well dress'd; but you may be better
than you look, like a singed cat, and a tit-bit afther all," says he;
and with that he ups with his knife and fork to taste a piece a' the
throut; but, my jew'l, the minit he puts his knife into the fish, there
was a murtherin' screech, that you'd think the life id lave you if you
hurd it, and away jumps the throut out av the fryin'-pan into the middle
a' the flure; and an the spot where it fell, up riz a lovely lady--the
beautifullest crathur that eyes ever seen, dressed in white, and a band
a' goold in her hair, and a sthrame a' blood runnin' down her arm.

"Look where you cut me, you villain," says she, and she held out her arm
to him--and, my dear, he thought the sight id lave his eyes.

"Couldn't you lave me cool and comfortable in the river where you snared
me, and not disturb me in my duty?" says she.

Well, he thrimbled like a dog in a wet sack, and at last he stammered
out somethin', and begged for his life, and ax'd her ladyship's pardin,
and said he didn't know she was

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

on duty, or he was too good a sojer not to know betther nor to meddle
wid her.

"I *was* on duty, then," says the lady; "I was watchin' for my true love
that is comin' by wather to me," says she, "an' if he comes while I'm
away, an' that I miss iv him, I'll turn you into a pinkeen, and I'll
hunt you up and down for evermore, while grass grows or wather runs."

Well the sojer thought the life id lave him, at the thoughts iv his
bein' turned into a pinkeen, and begged for mercy; and with that says
the lady--

"Renounce your evil coorses," says she, "you villain, or you'll repint
it too late; be a good man for the futhur, and go to your duty <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) reg'lar, and now," says she, "take me back
and put me into the river again, where you found me."

"Oh, my lady," says the sojer, "how could I have the heart to drownd a
beautiful lady like you?"

But before he could say another word, the lady was vanished, and there
he saw the little throut an the ground. Well he put it in a clean plate,
and away he runs for the bare life, for fear her lover would come while
she was away; and he run, and he run, even till he came to the cave
agin, and threw the throut into the river. The minit he did, the wather
was as red as blood for a little while, by rayson av the cut, I suppose,
until the sthrame washed the stain away; and to this day there's a
little red mark an the throut's side, where it was cut. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md)

Well, sir, from that day out the sojer was an altered man, and reformed
his ways, and went to his duty reg'lar, and fasted three times
a-week--though it was never fish he tuk an fastin' days, for afther the
fright he got, fish id never rest an his stomach--savin' your presence.

But anyhow, he was an altered man, as I said before, and in coorse o'
time he left the army, and turned hermit at last; and they say he *used
to pray evermore for the soul of the White Throut*.

\[These trout stories are common all over Ireland. Many holy wells are
haunted by such blessed trout. There is a trout in a well on the border
of Lough Gill, Sligo, that some paganish person put once on the
gridiron. It carries the marks to this day. Long ago, the saint who
sanctified the well put that trout there. Nowadays it is only visible to
the pious, who have done due penance.\]
