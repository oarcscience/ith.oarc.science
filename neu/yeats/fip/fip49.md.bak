### THE WITCHES' EXCURSION. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)

PATRICK KENNEDY

SHEMUS RUA <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27) (Red James.md) awakened from
his sleep one night by noises in his kitchen. Stealing to the door, he
saw half-a-dozen old women sitting round the fire, jesting and laughing,
his old housekeeper, Madge, quite frisky and gay, helping her sister
crones to cheering glasses of punch. He began to admire the impudence
and imprudence of Madge, displayed in the invitation and the riot, but
recollected on the instant her officiousness in urging him to take a
comfortable posset, which she had brought to his bedside just before he
fell asleep. Had he drunk it, he would have been just now deaf to the
witches' glee. He heard and saw them drink his health in such a mocking
style as nearly to tempt him to charge them, besom. in hand, but he
restrained himself.

The jug being emptied, one of them cried out, "Is it time to be gone?"
and at the same moment, putting on a red cap, she added--

"By yarrow and rue,  
And my red cap too,  
  Hie over to England."

\[paragraph continues\] Making use of a twig which she held in her hand
as a steed, she gracefully soared up the chimney, and was rapidly

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

followed by the rest. But when it came to the house-keeper, Shemus
interposed. "By your leave, ma'am," said he, snatching twig and cap.
"Ah, you desateful ould crocodile! If I find you here on my return,
there'll be wigs on the green--

'By yarrow and rue,  
And my red cap too,  
Hie over to England'."

\[paragraph continues\] The words were not out of his mouth when he was
soaring above the ridge pole, and swiftly ploughing the air. He was
careful to speak no word (being somewhat conversant with witch-lore), as
the result would be a tumble, and the immediate return of the
expedition.

In a very short time they had crossed the Wicklow hills, the Irish Sea,
and the Welsh mountains, and were charging, at whirlwind speed, the hall
door of a castle. Shemus, only for the company in which he found
himself, would have cried out for pardon, expecting to be *mummy*
against the hard oak door in a moment; but, all bewildered, he found
himself passing through the keyhole, along a passage, down a flight of
steps, and through a cellar-door key-hole before he could form any clear
idea of his situation.

Waking to the full consciousness of his position, he found himself
sitting on a stillion, plenty of lights glimmering round, and he and his
companions, with full tumblers of frothing wine in hand, hob-nobbing and
drinking healths as jovially and recklessly as if the liquor was
honestly come by, and they were sitting in *Shemus's* own kitchen. The
red *birredh* <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) has assimilated
*Shemus's* nature for the time being to that of his unholy companions.
The heady liquors soon got into their brains, and a period of
unconsciousness succeeded the ecstasy, the head-ache, the turning round
of the barrels, and the "scattered sight" of poor Shemus. He woke up
under the impression of being roughly seized, and shaken, and dragged
upstairs, and subjected to a disagreeable examination by the lord of the
castle, in his state parlour. There was much derision among the whole
company, gentle

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

and simple, on hearing Shemus's explanation, and, as the thing occurred
in the dark ages, the unlucky Leinster man was sentenced to be hung as
soon as the gallows could be prepared for the occasion.

The poor Hibernian was in the cart proceeding on his last journey, with
a label on his back, and another on his breast, announcing him as the
remorseless villain who for the last month had been draining the casks
in my lord's vault every night, He was surprised to hear himself
addressed by his name, and in his native tongue, by an old woman in the
crowd. "Ach, Shemus, alanna! is it going to die you are in a strange
place without your *cappen d'yarrag*?" <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) These words infused hope and courage into
the poor victim's heart. He turned to the lord and humbly asked leave to
die in his red cap, which he supposed had dropped from his head in the
vault. A servant was sent for the head-piece, and Shemus felt lively
hope warming his heart while placing it on his head. On the platform he
was graciously allowed to address the spectators, which he proceeded to
do in the usual formula composed for the benefit of flying
stationers--"Good people all, a warning take by me;" but when he had
finished the line, "My parents reared me tenderly," he unexpectedly
added--"By yarrow and rue," etc., and the disappointed spectators saw
him shoot up obliquely through the air in the style of a sky-rocket that
had missed its aim. It is said that the lord took the circumstance much
to heart, and never afterwards hung a man for twenty-four hours after
his offence.
