### THE SOUL CAGES

T. CROFTON CROKER

Jack Dogherty lived on the coast of the county Clare. Jack was a
fisherman, as his father and grandfather before him had been. Like them,
too, he lived all alone (but for

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the wife), and just in the same spot. People used to wonder why the
Dogherty family were so fond of that wild situation, so far away from
all human kind, and in the midst of huge shattered rocks, with nothing
but the wide ocean to look upon. But they had their own good reasons for
it.

The place was just the only spot on that part of the coast where anybody
could well live. There was a neat little creek, where a boat might lie
as snug as a puffin in her nest, and out from this creek a ledge of
sunken rocks ran into the sea. Now when the Atlantic, according to
custom, was raging with a storm, and a good westerly wind was blowing
strong on the coast, many a richly-laden ship went to pieces on these
rocks; and then the fine bales of cotton and tobacco, and such like
things, and the pipes of wine and the puncheons of rum, and the casks of
brandy, and the kegs of Hollands that used to come ashore! Dunbeg Bay
was just like a little estate to the Doghertys.

Not but they were kind and humane to a distressed sailor, if ever one
had the good luck to get to land; and many a time indeed did Jack put
out in his little *corragh* (which, though not quite equal to honest
Andrew Hennessy's canvas life-boat would breast the billows like any
gannet), to lend a hand towards bringing off the crew from a wreck. But
when the ship had gone to pieces, and the crew were all lost, who would
blame Jack for picking up all he could find?

"And who is the worse of it?" said he. "For as to the king, God bless
him! everybody knows he's rich enough already without getting what's
floating in the sea."

Jack, though such a hermit, was a good-natured, jolly fellow. No other,
sure, could ever have coaxed Biddy Mahony to quit her father's snug and
warm house in the middle of the town of Ennis, and to go so many miles
off to live among the rocks, with the seals and sea-gulls for next-door
neighbours. But Biddy knew that Jack was the man for a woman who wished
to be comfortable and happy; for to say nothing of the fish, Jack had
the supplying of half

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the gentlemen's houses of the country with the *Godsends* that came into
the bay. And she was right in her choice; for no woman ate, drank, or
slept better, or made a prouder appearance at chapel on Sundays, than
Mrs. Dogherty.

Many a strange sight, it may well be supposed, did Jack see, and many a
strange sound did he hear, but nothing daunted him. So far was he from
being afraid of Merrows, or such beings, that the very first wish of his
heart was to fairly meet with one. Jack had heard that they were mighty
like Christians, and that luck had always come out of an acquaintance
with them. Never, therefore, did he dimly discern the Merrows moving
along the face of the waters in their robes of mist, but he made direct
for them; and many a scolding did Biddy, in her own quiet way, bestow
upon Jack for spending his whole day out at sea, and bringing home no
fish. Little did poor Biddy know the fish Jack was after!

It was rather annoying to Jack that, though living in a place where the
Merrows were as plenty as lobsters, he never could get a right view of
one. What vexed him more was that both his father and grandfather had
often and often seen them; and he even remembered hearing, when a child,
how his grandfather, who was the first of the family that had settled
down at the creek, had been so intimate with a Merrow that, only for
fear of vexing the priest, he would have had him stand for one of his
children. This, however, Jack did not well know how to believe.

Fortune at length began to think that it was only right that Jack should
know as much as his father and grandfather did. Accordingly, one day
when he had strolled a little farther than usual along the coast to the
northward, just as he turned a point, he saw something, like to nothing
he had ever seen before, perched upon a rock at a little distance out to
sea. It looked green in the body, as well as he could discern at that
distance, and he would have sworn, only the thing was impossible, that
it had a cocked hat in its hand. Jack stood for a good half-hour
straining his eyes,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

and wondering at it, and all the time the thing did not stir hand or
foot. At last Jack's patience was quite worn out, and he gave a loud
whistle and a hail, when the Merrow (for such it was) started up, put
the cocked hat on its head, and dived down, head foremost, from the
rock.

Jack's curiosity was now excited, and he constantly directed his steps
towards the point; still he could never get a glimpse of the
sea-gentleman with the cocked hat; and with thinking and thinking about
the matter, he began at last to fancy he had been only dreaming. One
very rough day, however, when the sea was running mountains high, Jack
Dogherty determined to give a look at the Merrow's rock (for he had
always chosen a fine day before), and then he saw the strange thing
cutting capers upon the top of the rock, and then diving down, and then
coming up, and then diving down again.

Jack had now only to choose his time (that is, a good blowing day), and
he might see the man of the sea as often as he pleased. All this.
however, did not satisfy him--"much will have more"; he wished now to
get acquainted with the Merrow, and even in this he succeeded. One
tremendous blustering day, before he got to the point whence he had a
view of the Merrow's rock, the storm came on so furiously that Jack was
obliged to take shelter in one of the caves which are so numerous along
the coast; and there, to his astonishment, he saw sitting before him a
thing with green hair, long green teeth, a red nose, and pig's eyes. It
had a fish's tail, legs with scales on them, and short arms like fins.
It wore no clothes, but had the cocked hat under its arm, and seemed
engaged thinking very seriously about something.

Jack, with all his courage, was a little daunted; but now or never,
thought he; so up he went boldly to the cogitating fishman, took off his
hat, and made his best bow.

"Your servant, sir," said Jack.

"Your servant, kindly, Jack Dogherty," answered the Merrow.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

"To be sure, then, how well your honour knows my name!" said Jack.

"Is it I not know your name, Jack Dogherty? Why man, I knew your
grandfather long before he was married to Judy Regan, your grandmother!
Ah, Jack, Jack, I was fond of that grandfather of yours; he was a mighty
worthy man in his time: I never met his match above or below, before or
since, for sucking in a shellful of brandy. I hope, my boy," said the
old fellow, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, "I hope you're his own
grandson!"

'Never fear me for that," said Jack; "if my mother had only reared me on
brandy, 'tis myself that would be a sucking infant to this hour!"

"Well, I like to hear you talk so manly; you and I must be better
acquainted, if it were only for your grandfather's sake. But, Jack, that
father of yours was not the thing! he had no head at all."

"I'm sure, said Jack, "since your honour lives down under the water, you
must be obliged to drink a power to keep any beat in you in such a
cruel, damp, could place. Well, I've often heard of Christians drinking
like fishes; and might I be so bold as ask where you get the spirits?"

"Where do you get them yourself, Jack?" said the Merrow, twitching his
red nose between his forefinger and thumb.

"Hubbubboo," cries Jack "now I see how it is; but I suppose, sir, your
honour has got a fine dry cellar below to keep them in."

"Let me alone for the cellar," said the Merrow, with a knowing wink of
his left eye.

'I'm sure," continued Jack, "it must be mighty well worth the looking
at."

"You may say that, Jack," said the Merrow; "and if you meet me here next
Monday, just at this time of the day, we will have a little more talk
with one another about the matter."

Jack and the Merrow parted the best friends in the world.\[paragraph
continues\]

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

On Monday they met, and Jack was not a little surprised to see that the
Merrow had two cocked hats with him, one under each arm.

"Might I take the liberty to ask, sir," said Jack, "why your honour has
brought the two hats with you today? You would not, sure, be going to
give me one of them, to keep for the *curiosity* of the thing?"

"No, no, Jack," said he, "I don't get my hats so easily, to part with
them that way; but I want you to come down and dine with me, and I
brought you that hat to dive with."

"Lord bless and preserve us!" cried Jack, in amazement, would you want
me to go down to the bottom of the salt sea ocean? Sure, I'd be
smothered and choked up with the water, to say nothing of being drowned!
And what would poor Biddy do for me, and what would she say?"

"And what matter what she says, you pinkeen? Who cares for Biddy's
squalling? It's long before your grandfather would have talked in that
way. Many's the time he stuck that same hat on his head, and dived down
boldly after me; and many's the snug bit of dinner and good shellful of
brandy he and I have had together below, under the water."

"Is it really, sir, and no joke?" said Jack; "why, then, sorrow from me
for ever and a day after, if I'll be a bit worse man nor my grandfather
was! Here goes--but play me fair now. Here's neck or nothing!" cried
Jack.

"That's your grandfather all over," said the old fellow; "so come along,
then, and do as I do."

They both left the cave, walked into the sea, and then swam a piece
until they got to the rock, The Merrow climbed to the top of it, and
Jack followed him. On the far side it was as straight as the wall of a
house, and the sea beneath looked so deep that Jack was almost cowed.

"Now, do you see, Jack," said the Merrow: "just put this hat on your
head, and mind to keep your eyes wide open. Take hold of my tail, and
follow after me, and you'll see what you'll see."

In he dashed, and in dashed Jack after him boldly.\[paragraph
continues\]

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

They went and they went, and Jack thought they'd never stop going. Many
a time did he wish himself sitting at home by the fireside with Biddy.
Yet where was the use of wishing now, when he was so many miles, as he
thought, below the waves of the Atlantic? Still he held hard by the
Merrow's tail, slippery as it was; and, at last, to Jack's great
surprise, they got out of the water, and he actually found himself on
dry land at the bottom of the sea. They landed just in front of a nice
house that was slated very neatly with oyster shells! and the Merrow,
turning about to Jack, welcomed him down.

Jack could hardly speak, what with wonder, and what with being out of
breath with travelling so fast through the water. He looked about him
and could see no living things, barring crabs and lobsters, of which
there were plenty walking leisurely about on the sand. Overhead was the
sea like a sky, and the fishes like birds swimming about in it.

"Why don't you speak, man?" said the Merrow: "I dare say you had no
notion that I had such a snug little concern here as this? Are you
smothered, or choked, or drowned, or are you fretting after Biddy, eh?"

"Oh! not myself indeed," said Jack, showing his teeth with a
good-humoured grin; "but who in the world would ever have thought of
seeing such a thing?"

'Yell, come along, and let's see what they've got for us to eat?"

Jack really was hungry, and it gave him no small pleasure to perceive a
fine column of smoke rising from the chimney, announcing what was going
on within. Into the house he followed the Merrow, and there he saw a
good kitchen, right well provided with everything. There was a noble
dresser, and plenty of pots and pans, with two young Merrows cooking.
His host then led him into the room, which was furnished shabbily
enough. Not a table or a chair was there in it; nothing but planks and
logs of wood to sit on, and eat off. There was, however, a good fire
blazing upon the hearth--a comfortable sight to Jack.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

"Come now, and I'll show you where I keep--you know what," said the
Merrow, with a sly look; and opening a little door, he led Jack into a
fine cellar, well filled with pipes, and kegs, and hogsheads, and
barrels.

"What do you say to that, Jack Dogherty? Eh! may be a body can't live
snug under the water?"

"Never the doubt of that," said Jack, with a convincing smack of his
upper lip, that he really thought what he said.

They went back to the room, and found dinner laid. There was no
tablecloth, to be sure--but what matter? It was not always Jack had one
at home. The dinner would have been no discredit to the first house of
the country on a fast day. The choicest of fish, and no wonder, was
there. Turbots, and sturgeons, and soles, and lobsters, and oysters, and
twenty other kinds, were on the planks at once, and plenty of the best
of foreign spirits. The wines, the old fellow said, were too cold for
his stomach.

Jack ate and drank till he could eat no more: then taking up a shell of
brandy, "Here's to your honour's good health, sir," said he; "though,
begging you pardon, it's mighty odd that as long as we've been
acquainted I don't know your name yet."

"That's true, Jack," replied he; "I never thought of it before, but
better late than never. My name's Coomara."

"And a mighty decent name it is," cried Jack, taking another shellfull:
"here's to your good health, Coomara, and may ye live these fifty years
to come!"

"Fifty years!" repeated Coomara; "I'm obliged to you, indeed! If you had
said five hundred, it would have been something worth the wishing."

"By the laws, sir," cries Jack, "*youz* live to a powerful age here
under the water! You knew my grandfather, and he's dead and gone better
than these sixty years. I'm sure it must be a healthy place to live in."

"No doubt of it; but come, Jack, keep the liquor stirring."

Shell after shell did they empty, and to Jack's exceeding

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

surprise, he found the drink never got into his head, owing, I suppose,
to the sea being over them, which kept their noddles cool.

Old Coomara got exceedingly comfortable, and sung several songs; but
Jack, if his life had depended on it, never could remember more than

"*Rum fum boodle boo,  
Ripple dipple nitty dob;  
Dumdoo doodle coo,  
Raffle taffle chittiboo*!"

\[paragraph continues\] It was the chorus to one of them; and, to say
the truth, nobody that I know has ever been able to pick any particular
meaning out of it; but that, to be sure, is the case with many a song
nowadays.

At length said he to Jack, "Now, my dear boy, if you follow me, I'll
show you my *curiosities*!" He opened a little door, and led Jack into a
large room, where Jack saw a great many odds and ends that Coomara had
picked up at one time or another. What chiefly took his attention,
however, were things like lobsterpots ranged on the ground along the
wall.

"Well, Jack, how do you like my *curiosities*?" said old Coo.

"Upon my *sowkins*, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) sir," said Jack,
"they're mighty well worth the looking at; but might I make so bold as
to ask what these things like lobster-pots are?"

"Oh! the Soul Cages, is it?"

"The what? sir!"

"These things here that I keep the souls in."

"*Arrah*! what souls, sir?" said Jack, in amazement; "sure the fish have
no souls in them?"

"Oh! no," replied Coo, quite coolly, "that they have not; but these are
the souls of drowned sailors."

"The Lord preserve us from all harm!" muttered lack, "how in the world
did you get them?"

"Easily enough: I've only, when I see a good storm

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

coming on, to set a couple of dozen of these, and then, when the sailors
are drowned and the souls get out of them under the water, the poor
things are almost perished to death, not being used to the cold; so they
make into my pots for shelter, and then I have them snug, and fetch them
home, and is it not well for them, poor souls, to get into such good
quarters?"

Jack was so thunderstruck he did not know what to say, so he said
nothing. They went back into the dining-room, and had a little more
brandy, which was excellent, and then, as Jack knew that it must be
getting late, and as Biddy might be uneasy, he stood up, and said he
thought it was time for him to be on the road.

"Just as you like, Jack," said Coo, "but take a *duc an durrus* <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) before you go; you've a cold journey before
you."

Jack knew better manners than to refuse the parting glass.

"I wonder," said he, "will I be able to make out my way home?"

"What should ail you," said Coo, "when I'll show you the way?"

Out they went before the house, and Coomara took one of the cocked hats,
and put it upon Jack's head the wrong way, and then lifted him up on his
shoulder that he might launch him up into the water.

"Now," says he, giving him a heave, "you'll come up just in the same
spot you came down in; and, Jack, mind and throw me back the hat."

He canted Jack off his shoulder, and up he shot like a bubble--whirr,
whiff, whiz--away he went up through the water, till he came to the very
rock he had jumped off where he found a landing-place, and then in he
threw the hat, which sunk like a stone.

The sun was just going down in the beautiful sky of a calm summer's
evening. *Feascor* was seen dimly twinkling in the cloudless heaven, a
solitary star, and the waves of the Atlantic flashed in a golden flood
of light. So Jack,

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

perceiving it was late, set off home; but when he got there, not a word
did he say to Biddy of where he had spent his day.

The state of the poor souls cooped up in the lobster-pots gave Jack a
great deal of trouble, and how to release them cost him a great deal of
thought. He at first had a mind to speak to the priest about the matter.
But what could the priest do, and what did Coo care for the priest?
Besides, Coo was a good sort of an old fellow, and did not think he was
doing any harm. Jack had a regard for him, too, and it also might not be
much to his own credit if it were known that he used to go dine with
Merrows. On the whole, he thought his best plan would be to ask Coo to
dinner, and to make him drunk, if he was able, and then to take the hat
and go down and turn up the pots. It was, first of all, necessary,
however, to get Biddy out of the way; for Jack was prudent enough, as
she was a woman, to wish to keep the thing secret from her.

Accordingly, Jack grew mighty pious all of a sudden, and said to Biddy
that he thought it would be for the good of both their souls if she was
to go and take her rounds at Saint John's Well, near Ennis. Biddy
thought so too, and accordingly off she set one fine morning at
day-dawn, giving Jack a strict charge to have an eye to the place. The
coast being clear, away went Jack to the rock to give the appointed
signal to Coomara, which was throwing a big stone into the water. Jack
threw, and up sprang Coo!

"Good morning, Jack," said he; "what do you want with me?"

"Just nothing at all to speak about, sir," returned Jack, "only to come
and take a bit of dinner with me, if I might make so free as to ask you,
and sure I'm now after doing so."

"It's quite agreeable, Jack, I assure you; what's your hour?"'

"Any time that's most convenient to you, sir--say one o'clock, that you
may go home, if you wish, with the daylight."

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

"I'll be with you," said Coo, "never fear me."

Jack went home, and dressed a noble fish dinner, and got out plenty of
his best foreign spirits, enough, for that matter, to make twenty men
drunk. Just to the minute came Coo, with his cocked hat under his arm.
Dinner was ready, they sat down, and ate and drank away manfully. Jack,
thinking of the poor souls below in the pots, plied old Coo well with
brandy, and encouraged him to sing, hoping to put him under the table,
but poor Jack forgot that he had not the sea over his head to keep it
cool. The brandy got into it, and did his business for him, and Coo
reeled off home, leaving his entertainer as dumb as a haddock on a Good
Friday.

Jack never woke till the next morning, and then he was in a sad way.
"'Tis to no use for me thinking to make that old Rapparee drunk," said
Jack, "and how in this world can I help the poor souls out of the
lobster-pots?" After ruminating nearly the whole day, a thought struck
him. "I have it," says he, slapping his knee; "I'll be sworn that Coo
never saw a drop of *poteen*, as old as he is, and that's the *thing* to
settle him! Oh! then, is not it well that Biddy will not be home these
two days yet; I can have another twist at him."

Jack asked Coo again, and Coo laughed at him for having no better head,
telling him he'd never come up to his grandfather.

"Well, but try me again," said Jack, "and I'll be bail to drink you
drunk and sober, and drunk again."

"Anything in my power," said Coo, "to oblige you."

At this dinner Jack took care to have his own liquor well watered, and
to give the strongest brandy he had to Coo. At last says he, "Pray, sir,
did you ever drink any poteen?--any real mountain dew?"

"No," says Coo; "what's that, and where does it come from?"

"Oh, that's a secret," said Jack, "but it's the right stuff--never
believe me again, if 'tis not fifty times as good as brandy or rum
either. Biddy's brother just sent me a

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

present of a little drop, in exchange for some brandy, and as you're an
old friend of the family, I kept it to treat you with."

"Well, let's see what sort of thing it is," said Coomara.

The *poteen* was the right sort. It was first-rate, and had the real
smack upon it. Coo was delighted: he drank and he sung *Rum bum boodle
boo* over and over again; and he laughed and he danced, till he fell on
the floor fast asleep. Then Jack, who had taken good care to keep
himself sober, snapt up the cocked hat--ran off to the rock--leaped, and
soon arrived at Coo's habitation.

All was as still as a churchyard at midnight--not a Merrow, old or
young, was there. In he went and turned up the pots, but nothing did he
see, only he heard a sort of a little whistle or chirp as he raised each
of them. At this he was surprised, till he recollected what the priests
had often said, that nobody living could see the soul, no more than they
could see the wind or the air. Having now done all that he could for
them, he set the pots as they were before, and sent a blessing after the
poor souls to speed them on their journey wherever they were going. Jack
now began to think of returning; he put the hat on, as was right, the
wrong way; but when he got out he found the water so high over his head
that he had no hopes of ever getting up into it, now that he had not old
Coomara to give him a lift. He walked about looking for a ladder, but
not one could he find, and not a rock was there in sight. At last he saw
a spot where the sea hung rather lower than anywhere else, so he
resolved to try there. Just as he came to it, a big cod happened to put
down his tail. Jack made a jump and caught hold of it, and the cod, all
in amazement, gave a bounce and pulled Jack up. The minute the hat
touched the water away Jack was whisked, and up he shot like a cork,
dragging the poor cod, that he forgot to let go, up with him tail
foremost. He got to the rock in no time and without a moment's delay
hurried home, rejoicing in the good deed he had done.

But, meanwhile, there was fine work at home; for our

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

friend Jack had hardly left the house on his soul-freeing expedition,
when back came Biddy from her soul-saving one to the well. When she
entered the house and saw the things lying *thrie-na-helah* <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) on the table before her--"Here's a pretty
job!" said she; "that blackguard of mine--what ill-luck I had ever to
marry him! He has picked up some vagabond or other, while I was praying
for the good of his soul, and they've been drinking all the *poteen*
that my own brother gave him, and all the spirits, to be sure, that he
was to have sold to his honour." Then hearing an outlandish kind of
grunt, she looked down, and saw Coomara lying under the table. "The
Blessed Virgin help me," shouted she, "if he has not made a real beast
of himself! Well, well, I've often heard of a man making a beast of
himself with drink! Oh hone, oh hone!--Jack, honey, what will I do with
you, or what will I do without you? How can any decent woman ever think
of living with a beast?"

With such like lamentations Biddy rushed out of the house, and was going
she knew not where, when she heard the well-known voice of Jack singing
a merry tune. Glad enough was Biddy to find him safe and sound, and not
turned into a thing that was like neither fish nor flesh. Jack was
obliged to tell her all, and Biddy, though she had half a mind to be
angry with him for not telling her before, owned that he had done a
great service to the poor souls. Back they both went most lovingly to
the house, and Jack wakened up Coomara; and, perceiving the old fellow
to be rather dull, he bid him not to be cast down, for 'twas many a good
man's case; said it all came of his not being used to the *poteen*, and
recommended him, by way of cure, to swallow a hair of the dog that bit
him. Coo, however, seemed to think he had had quite enough. He got up,
quite out of sorts, and without having the manners to say one word in
the way of civility, he sneaked off to cool himself by a jaunt through
the salt water.

Coomara, never missed the souls. He and Jack continued

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

the best friends in the world, and no one, perhaps, ever equalled Jack
for freeing souls from purgatory; for he contrived fifty excuses for
getting into the house below the sea, unknown to the old fellow, and
then turning up the pots and letting out the souls. It vexed him, to be
sure, that he could never see them; but as he knew the thing to be
impossible, he was obliged to be satisfied.

Their intercourse continued for several years. However, one morning, on
Jack's throwing in a stone as usual, he got no answer. He flung another,
and another, still there was no reply. He went away, and returned the
following morning, but it was to no purpose. As he was without the hat,
he could not go down to see what had become of old Coo, but his belief
was, that the old man, or the old fish, or whatever he was, had either
died, or had removed from that part of the country.
