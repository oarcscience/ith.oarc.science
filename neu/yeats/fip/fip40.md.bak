### SONG OF THE GHOST.

ALFRED PERCIVAL GRAVES.

When all were dreaming  
  But Pastheen Power,  
A light came streaming  
  Beneath her bower: <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>  
A heavy foot  
  At her door delayed,  
A heavy hand  
  On the latch was laid.

"Now who dare venture,  
  At this dark hour,  
Unbid to enter  
  My maiden bower?"  
"Dear Pastheen, open  
  The door to me,  
And your true lover  
  You'll surely see."

"My own true lover,  
  So tall and brave,  
Lives exiled over  
  The angry wave."  
"Your true love's body  
  Lies on the bier,  
His faithful spirit  
  Is with you here."

"His look was cheerful,  
  His voice was gay;  
Your speech is fearful,  
  Your face is grey;  
And sad and sunken  
  Your eye of blue,  
But Patrick, Patrick,  
  Alas! 'tis you!"

Ere dawn was breaking  
  She heard below  
The two cocks shaking  
  Their wings to crow. <span id="page_136">p. 136</span>  
"Oh, hush you, hush you,  
  Both red and grey,  
Or will you hurry  
  My love away.

"Oh, hush your crowing,  
  Both grey and red,  
Or he'll be going  
  To join the dead;  
Or, cease from calling  
  His ghost to the mould,  
And I'll come crowning  
  Your combs with gold."

When all were dreaming  
  But Pastheen Power,  
A light went streaming  
  From out her bower,  
And on the morrow,  
  When they awoke,  
They knew that sorrow  
  Her heart had broke.
