### OMENS.--Page [108](fip31.htm#page_108.md).

Coach-a-Bower. I know one family where death is announced by the

or other birds. When McManus, of '48 celebrity, was sitting by his dying
brother, a bird of vulture-like appearance came through the window and
lighted on the breast Of the dying man. The two watched in terror, not
daring to drive it off. It crouched there, bright-eyed, till the soul
left the body. It was considered a most evil omen. Lefanu worked this
into a tale. I have good authority for tracing its origin to McManus and
his brother.
