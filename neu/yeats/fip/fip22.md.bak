### FLORY CANTILLON'S FUNERAL

T. CROFTON CROKER

The ancient burial-place of the Cantillon family was on an island in
Ballyheigh Bay. This island was situated at no great distance from the
shore, and at a remote period was overflowed in one of the encroachments
which the Atlantic has made on that part of the coast of Kerry. The
fishermen declare they have often seen the ruined walls of an old chapel
beneath them in the water, as they sailed over the clear green sea of a
sunny afternoon. However this may be, it is well-known that the
Cantillons were, like most other Irish families, strongly attached to
their ancient burial-place; and this attachment led to the custom, when
any of the family died, of carrying the corpse to the seaside, where the
coffin was left on the shore within reach of the tide. In the morning it
had disappeared, being, as

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

was traditionally believed, conveyed away by the ancestors of the
deceased to their family tomb.

Connor Crowe, a county Clare man, was related to the Cantillons by
marriage. "Connor Mac in Cruagh, of the seven quarters of Breintragh,"
as he was commonly called, and a proud man he was of the name. Connor,
be it known, would drink a quart of salt water, for its medicinal
virtues, before breakfast; and for the same reason, I suppose, double
that quantity of raw whiskey between breakfast and night, which last he
did with as little inconvenience to himself as any man in the barony of
Moyferta; and were I to add Clanderalaw and Ibrickan, I don't think I
should say wrong.

On the death of Florence Cantillon, Connor Crowe was determined to
satisfy himself about the truth of this story of the old church under
the sea: so when he heard the news of the old fellow's death, away with
him to Ardfert, where Flory was laid out in high style, and a beautiful
corpse he made.

Flory had been as jolly and as rollicking a boy in his day as ever was
stretched, and his wake was in every respect worthy of him. There was
all kind of entertainment, and all sort of diversion at it, and no less
than three girls got husbands there--more luck to them. Everything was
as it should be; all that side of the country, from Dingle to Tarbert,
was at the funeral. The Keen was sung long and bitterly; and, according
to the family custom, the coffin was carried to Ballyheigh strand, where
it was laid upon the shore, with a prayer for the repose of the dead.

The mourners departed, one group after another, and at last Connor Crowe
was left alone. He then pulled out his whiskey bottle, his drop of
comfort, as he called it, which he required, being in grief; and down he
sat upon a big stone that was sheltered by a projecting rock, and partly
concealed from view, to await with patience the appearance of the
ghostly undertakers.

The evening came on mild and beautiful. He whistled an old air which he
had heard in his childhood, hoping to keep

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

idle fears out of his head; but the wild strain of that melody brought a
thousand recollections with it, which only made the twilight appear more
pensive.

"If 'twas near the gloomy tower of Dunmore, in my own sweet country, I
was," said Connor Crowe, with a sigh, "one might well believe that the
prisoners, who were murdered long ago there in the vaults under the
castle, would be the hands to carry off the coffin out of envy, for
never a one of them was buried decently, nor had as much as a coffin
amongst them all. 'Tis often, sure enough, I have heard lamentations and
great mourning coming from the vaults of Dunmore Castle; but," continued
he, after fondly pressing his lips to the mouth of his companion and
silent comforter, the whiskey bottle, "didn't I know all the time well
enough, 'twas the dismal sounding waves working through the cliffs and
hollows of the rocks, and fretting themselves to foam. Oh, then, Dunmore
Castle, it is you that are the gloomy-looking tower on a gloomy day,
with the gloomy hills behind you; when one has gloomy thoughts on their
heart, and sees you like a ghost rising out of the smoke made by the
kelp burners on the strand, there is, the Lord save us! as fearful a
look about you as about the Blue Man's Lake at midnight. Well, then,
anyhow," said Connor, after a pause, "is it not a blessed night, though
surely the moon looks mighty pale in the face? St. Senan himself between
us and all kinds of harm."

It was, in truth, a lovely moonlight night; nothing was to be seen
around the dark rocks, and the white pebbly beach, upon which the sea
broke with a hoarse and melancholy murmur. Connor, notwithstanding his
frequent draughts, felt rather queerish, and almost began to repent his
curiosity. It was certainly a solemn sight to behold the black coffin
resting upon the white strand. His imagination gradually converted the
deep moaning of old ocean into a mournful wail for the dead, and from
the shadowy recesses of the rocks he imaged forth strange and visionary
forms.

As the night advanced, Connor became weary with watching. He caught
himself more than once in the act

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

of nodding, when suddenly giving his head a shake, he would look towards
the black coffin. But the narrow house of death remained unmoved before
him.

It was long past midnight, and the moon was sinking into the sea, when
he heard the sound of many voices, which gradually became stronger,
above the heavy and monotonous roll of the sea. He listened, and
presently could distinguish a Keen of exquisite sweetness, the notes of
which rose and fell with the heaving of the waves, whose deep murmur
mingled with and supported the strain!

The Keen grew louder and louder, and seemed to approach the beach, and
then fell into a low, plaintive wail. As it ended Connor beheld a number
of strange and, in the dim light, mysterious-looking figures emerge from
the sea, and surround the coffin, which they prepared to launch into the
water.

"This comes of marrying with the creatures of earth," said one of the
figures, in a clear, yet hollow tone.

"True," replied another, with a voice stiff more fearful, "our king
would never have commanded his gnawing white-toothed waves to devour the
rocky roots of the island cemetery, had not his daughter, Durfulla, been
buried there by her mortal husband!"

"But the time will come," said a third, bending over the coffin,

"When mortal eye--our work shall spy,  
And mortal ear--our dirge shall hear."

"Then," said a fourth, "our burial of the Cantillons is at an end for
ever!"

As this was spoken the coffin was borne from the beach by a retiring
wave, and the company of sea people prepared to follow it; but at the
moment one chanced to discover Connor Crowe, as fixed with wonder and as
motionless with fear as the stone on which he sat.

"The time is come," cried the unearthly being, "the time is come; a
human eye looks on the forms of ocean, a human ear has heard their
voices. Farewell to the\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

Cantillons; the sons of the sea are no longer doomed to bury the dust of
the earth!"

One after the other turned slowly round, and regarded Connor Crowe, who
still remained as if bound by a spell. Again arose their funeral song;
and on the next wave they followed the coffin. The sound of the
lamentation died away, and at length nothing was heard but the rush of
waters. The coffin and the train of sea people sank over the old
churchyard, and never since the funeral of old Flory Cantillon have any
of the family been carried to the strand of Ballyheigh, for conveyance
to their rightful burial-place, beneath the waves of the Atlantic.
