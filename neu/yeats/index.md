William Butler Yeats (born 1865, died 1939), a key figure in the Celtic
literary revival at the turn of the 20th Century, also moved in occult
circles and knew many of the key figures of the Golden Dawn. He served
as a Senator of the Irish free state and won the Nobel prize for
literature in 1923.

Note on copyrights: all of Yeats' books and other writings are
copyrighted in the UK and EU because he died in 1939, since their
current copyright term is death+70 years. Therefore they will be covered
by copyright in the UK and EU until 2009. However, all of his writings
prior to January 1st, 1923 are in the public domain in the United States
by the terms of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act; since sacred-texts
is hosted in the US we abide by this criteria. We have been careful only
to use pre-1923 editions to produce these etexts. Please take this into
consideration if you plan to republish or post these texts outside the
US.
