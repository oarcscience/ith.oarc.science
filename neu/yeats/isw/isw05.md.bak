### THE FOLLY OF BEING COMFORTED.

One that is ever kind said yesterday  
'Your well beloved's hair has threads of grey  
And little shadows come about her eyes;  
Time can but make it easier to be wise  
Though now it's hard, till trouble is at an end;  
And so be patient, be wise and patient, friend.'  
But heart, there is no comfort, not a grain.  
Time can but make her beauty over again  
Because of that great nobleness of hers;  
The fire that stirs; about her, when she stirs <span id="page_21">p.

Burns but more clearly; O she had not these ways  
When all the wild summer was in her gaze.  
O heart, O heart, if she'd but turn her head,  
You'd know the folly of being comforted.
