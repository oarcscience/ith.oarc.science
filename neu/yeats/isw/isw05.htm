<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FOLLY OF BEING COMFORTED.</H3>
<P>One that is ever kind said yesterday<BR>
'Your well beloved's hair has threads of grey<BR>
And little shadows come about her eyes;<BR>
Time can but make it easier to be wise<BR>
Though now it's hard, till trouble is at an end;<BR>
And so be patient, be wise and patient, friend.'<BR>
But heart, there is no comfort, not a grain.<BR>
Time can but make her beauty over again<BR>
Because of that great nobleness of hers;<BR>
The fire that stirs; about her, when she stirs <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A><BR>
Burns but more clearly; O she had not these ways<BR>
When all the wild summer was in her gaze.<BR>
O heart, O heart, if she'd but turn her head,<BR>
You'd know the folly of being comforted.</P>
