### THE RIDER FROM THE NORTH.

From the play of The Country of the Young.

There's many a strong farmer  
Whose heart would break in two  
If he could see the townland  
That we are riding to;  
Boughs have their fruit and blossom,  
At all times of the year,  
Rivers are running over  
With red beer and brown beer.  
An old man plays the bagpipes  
In a golden and silver wood,  
Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,  
Are dancing in a crowd. <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>  
The little fox he murmured,  
'O what is the world's bane?'  
The sun was laughing sweetly,  
The moon plucked at my rein;  
But the little red fox murmured,  
'O do not pluck at his rein,  
He is riding to the townland  
That is the world's bane.'

When their hearts are so high,  
That they would come to blows,  
They unhook their heavy swords  
From golden and silver boughs;  
But all that are killed in battle  
Awaken to life again;  
It is lucky that their story  
Is not known among men.  
For O the strong farmers  
That would let the spade lie,  
For their hearts would be like a cup  
That somebody had drunk dry. <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>  
The little fox he: murmured,  
'O what is the world's bane?'  
The sun was laughing sweetly,  
The moon plucked at my rein;  
But the little red fox murmured,  
'O do not pluck at his rein,  
He is riding to the townland  
That is the world's bane.'

Michael will unhook his trumpet  
From a bough overhead,  
And blow a little noise  
When the supper has been spread.  
Gabriel will come from the water  
With a fish tail, and talk  
Of wonders that have happened  
On wet roads where men walk,  
And lift up an old horn  
Of hammered silver, and drink  
Till he has fallen asleep  
Upon the starry brink. <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>  
The little fox he murmured,  
'O what is the world's bane?  
The sun was laughing sweetly,  
The moon plucked at my rein;  
But the little red fox murmured,  
'O do not pluck at his rein,  
He is riding to the townland,  
That is the world's bane.'
