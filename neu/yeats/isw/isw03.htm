<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BAILE AND AILLINN.</H3>
<P>Argument. Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but Aengus, the Master of Love, wishing them to be happy in his own land among the dead, told to each a story of the other's death, so that their hearts were broken and they died.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="RED">I hardly hear the curlew cry,<BR>
Nor the grey rush when wind is high,<BR>
Before my thoughts begin to run<BR>
On the heir of Ulad, Buan's son,<BR>
Baile who had the honey mouth,<BR>
And that mild woman of the south,<BR>
Aillinn, who was King Lugaid's heir.<BR>
Their love was never drowned in care<BR>
Of this or that thing, nor grew cold<BR>
Because their bodies had grown old;<BR>
Being forbid to marry on earth<BR>
They blossomed to immortal mirth.</FONT></P>
<P>About the time when Christ was born,<BR>
When the long wars for the White Horn<BR>
And the Brown Bull had not yet come,<BR>
Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some<BR>
Called rather Baile Little-Land,<BR>
Rode out of Emain with a band<BR>
Of harpers and young men, and they<BR>
Imagined, as they struck the way<BR>
To many pastured Muirthemne, <A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A> <BR>
That all things fell out happily<BR>
And. there, for all that fools had said,<BR>
Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</P>
<P>They found an old man running there,<BR>
He had ragged long grass-yellow hair;<BR>
He had knees that stuck out of his hose;<BR>
He had puddle water in his shoes;<BR>
He had half a cloak to keep him dry;<BR>
Although he had a squirrel's eye.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="RED">O wandering birds and rushy beds<BR>
You put such folly in our heads<BR>
With. all this crying in the wind<BR>
No common love is to our mind,<BR>
And our poor Kate or Nan is less<BR>
Than. any whose unhappiness<BR>
Awoke the harp strings long ago.<BR>
Yet they that know all things but know<BR>
That all life had to give us is<BR>
A child's laughter, a woman's kiss. </FONT><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="RED"><BR>
Who was it put so great a scorn<BR>
In the grey reeds that night and morn<BR>
Are trodden and broken by the herds,<BR>
And in the light bodies of birds<BR>
That north wind tumbles to and fro<BR>
And pinches among hall and snow?</FONT></P>
<P>That runner said, 'I am from the south;<BR>
I run to Baile Honey-Mouth<BR>
To tell him how the girl Aillinn<BR>
Rode from the country of her kin<BR>
And old and young men rode with her:<BR>
For all that country had been astir<BR>
If anybody half as fair<BR>
Had chosen a husband anywhere<BR>
But where it could see her every day.<BR>
When they had ridden a little way<BR>
An old man caught the horse's head<BR>
With "You must home again and wed<BR>
With somebody in your own land."<BR>
A young man cried and kissed her hand<BR>
"O lady, wed with one of us;" <A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A><BR>
And when no face grew piteous<BR>
For any gentle thing she spake<BR>
She fell and died of the heart-break.'</P>
<P>Because a lover's heart's worn out<BR>
Being tumbled and blown about<BR>
By its own blind imagining,<BR>
And will believe that anything<BR>
That is bad enough to be true, is true,<BR>
Baile's heart was broken in two;<BR>
And he being laid upon green boughs<BR>
Was carried to the goodly house<BR>
Where the Hound of Ulad sat before<BR>
The brazen pillars of his door;<BR>
His face bowed low to weep the end<BR>
Of the harper's daughter and her friend;<BR>
For although years had passed away<BR>
He always wept them on that day,<BR>
For on that day they had been betrayed;<BR>
And now that Honey-Mouth is laid<BR>
Under a cairn of sleepy stone<BR>
Before his eyes, he has tears for none, <A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A><BR>
Although he is carrying stone, but two<BR>
For whom the cairn's but heaped anew.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="RED">We hold because our memory is<BR>
So full of that thing and of this<BR>
That out of sight is out of mind.<BR>
But the grey rush under the wind<BR>
And the grey bird with crooked bill<BR>
Have such long memories that they still<BR>
Remember Deirdre and her man,<BR>
And when we walk with Kate or Nan<BR>
About the windy water side<BR>
Our heart can hear the voices chide.<BR>
How could we be so soon content<BR>
Who know the way that Naoise went?<BR>
And they have news of Deirdre's eyes<BR>
Who being lovely was so wise,<BR>
Ah wise, my heart knows well how wise.</FONT></P>
<P>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,<BR>
Gathering his cloak about him, run<BR>
Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids<BR>
Who amid leafy lights and shades <A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A><BR>
Dreamed of the hands that would unlace<BR>
Their bodices in some dim place<BR>
When they had come to the marriage bed;<BR>
And harpers pondering with bowed head<BR>
A music that had thought enough<BR>
Of the ebb of all things to make love<BR>
Grow gentle without sorrowings;<BR>
And leather-coated men with slings<BR>
Who peered about on every side;<BR>
And amid leafy light he cried,<BR>
I He is well out of wind and wave,<BR>
They have heaped the stones above his grave<BR>
In Muirthemne and over it<BR>
In changeless Ogham letters writ<BR>
<FONT COLOR="RED">Baile that was of Rury's seed.</FONT><BR>
But the gods long ago decreed<BR>
No waiting maid should ever spread<BR>
Baile and Aillinn's marriage bed,<BR>
For they should clip and clip again<BR>
Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.<BR>
Therefore it is but little news<BR>
That put this hurry in my shoes.' <A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A><BR>
And hurrying to the south he came<BR>
To that high hill the herdsmen name<BR>
The Hill Seat of Leighin, because<BR>
Some god or king had made the laws<BR>
That held the land together there,<BR>
In old times among the clouds of the air.</P>
<P>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;<BR>
Two swans came flying up to him<BR>
Linked by a gold chain each to each<BR>
And with low murmuring laughing speech<BR>
Alighted on the windy grass.<BR>
They knew him: his changed body was<BR>
Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings<BR>
Were hovering over the harp strings<BR>
That Etain, Midhir's wife, had wove<BR>
In the hid place, being crazed by love.</P>
<P>What shall I call them? fish that swim<BR>
Scale rubbing scale where light is dim<BR>
By a broad water-lily leaf;<BR>
Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf<BR>
Forgotten at the threshing place; <A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A><BR>
Or birds lost in the one clear space<BR>
Of morning light in a dim sky;<BR>
Or it may be, the eyelids of one eye<BR>
Or the door pillars of one house,<BR>
Or two sweet blossoming apple boughs<BR>
That have one shadow on the ground;<BR>
Or the two strings that made one sound<BR>
Where that wise harper's finger ran;<BR>
For this young girl and this young man<BR>
Have happiness without an end<BR>
Because they have made so good a friend.</P>
<P>They know all wonders, for they pass<BR>
The towery gates of Gorias<BR>
And Findrias and Falias<BR>
And long-forgotten Murias,<BR>
Among the giant kings whose hoard<BR>
Cauldron and spear and stone and sword<BR>
Was robbed before Earth gave the wheat;<BR>
Wandering from broken street to street<BR>
They come where some huge watcher is<BR>
And tremble with their love and kiss. <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A><BR>
They know undying things, for they<BR>
Wander where earth withers away,<BR>
Though nothing troubles the great streams<BR>
But light from the pale stars, and gleams<BR>
From the holy orchards, where there is none<BR>
But fruit that is of precious stone,<BR>
Or apples of the sun and moon.</P>
<P>What were our praise to them: they eat<BR>
Quiet's wild heart, like daily meat,<BR>
Who when night thickens are afloat<BR>
On dappled skins in a glass boat<BR>
Far out under a windless sky,<BR>
While over them birds of Aengus fly,<BR>
And over the tiller and the prow<BR>
And waving white wings to and fro<BR>
Awaken wanderings of light air<BR>
To stir their coverlet and their hair.</P>
<P>And poets found, old writers say,<BR>
A yew tree where his body lay,<BR>
But a wild apple hid the grass <A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A><BR>
With its sweet blossom where hers was<BR>
And being in good heart, because<BR>
A better time had come again<BR>
After the deaths of many men,<BR>
And that long fighting at the ford,<BR>
They wrote on tablets of thin board,<BR>
Made of the apple and the yew,<BR>
All the love stories that they knew.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="RED">Let rush and bird cry out their fill<BR>
Of the harper's daughter if they will,<BR>
Beloved, I am not afraid of her<BR>
She is not wiser noir lovelier,<BR>
And you are more high of heart than she<BR>
For all her wanderings over-sea;<BR>
But I'd have bird and rush forget<BR>
Those other two, for never yet<BR>
Has lover lived but longed to wive<BR>
Like them that are no more alive.</FONT></P>
