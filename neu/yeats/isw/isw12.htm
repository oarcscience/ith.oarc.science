<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE RIDER FROM THE NORTH.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">From the play of The Country of the Young.</P>
<P>There's many a strong farmer<BR>
Whose heart would break in two<BR>
If he could see the townland<BR>
That we are riding to;<BR>
Boughs have their fruit and blossom,<BR>
At all times of the year,<BR>
Rivers are running over<BR>
With red beer and brown beer.<BR>
An old man plays the bagpipes<BR>
In a golden and silver wood,<BR>
Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,<BR>
Are dancing in a crowd. <A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A><BR>
The little fox he murmured,<BR>
'O what is the world's bane?'<BR>
The sun was laughing sweetly,<BR>
The moon plucked at my rein;<BR>
But the little red fox murmured,<BR>
'O do not pluck at his rein,<BR>
He is riding to the townland<BR>
That is the world's bane.'</P>
<P>When their hearts are so high,<BR>
That they would come to blows,<BR>
They unhook their heavy swords<BR>
From golden and silver boughs;<BR>
But all that are killed in battle<BR>
Awaken to life again;<BR>
It is lucky that their story<BR>
Is not known among men.<BR>
For O the strong farmers<BR>
That would let the spade lie,<BR>
For their hearts would be like a cup<BR>
That somebody had drunk dry. <A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A><BR>
The little fox he: murmured,<BR>
'O what is the world's bane?'<BR>
The sun was laughing sweetly,<BR>
The moon plucked at my rein;<BR>
But the little red fox murmured,<BR>
'O do not pluck at his rein,<BR>
He is riding to the townland<BR>
That is the world's bane.'</P>
<P>Michael will unhook his trumpet<BR>
From a bough overhead,<BR>
And blow a little noise<BR>
When the supper has been spread.<BR>
Gabriel will come from the water<BR>
With a fish tail, and talk<BR>
Of wonders that have happened<BR>
On wet roads where men walk,<BR>
And lift up an old horn<BR>
Of hammered silver, and drink<BR>
Till he has fallen asleep<BR>
Upon the starry brink. <A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A><BR>
The little fox he murmured,<BR>
'O what is the world's bane?<BR>
The sun was laughing sweetly,<BR>
The moon plucked at my rein;<BR>
But the little red fox murmured,<BR>
'O do not pluck at his rein,<BR>
He is riding to the townland,<BR>
That is the world's bane.'</P>
