### THE OLD MEN ADMIRING THEMSELVES IN THE WATER.

I heard the old, old men say  
'Everything alters,  
And one by one we drop away.' <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>  
They had hands like claws, and their knees  
Were twisted like the old thorn trees  
By the waters.  
I heard the old, old men say  
'All that's beautiful drifts away  
Like the waters.'
