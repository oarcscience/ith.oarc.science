### ADAM'S CURSE.

We sat together at one summer's end  
That beautiful mild woman your close friend  
And you and I, and talked of poetry.

I said 'a line will take us hours maybe,  
Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought  
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.  
Better go down upon your marrow bones  
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones  
Like an old pauper in all kinds of weather;  
For to articulate sweet sounds together  
Is to work harder than all these and yet  
Be thought an idler by the noisy set  
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen  
The martyrs call the world.' <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>  
                            That woman then  
Murmured with her young voice, for whose mild sake  
There's many a one shall find out all heartache  
In finding that it's young and mild and low.  
'There is one thing that all we women know  
Although we never heard of it at school,  
That we must labour to be beautiful.'

I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing  
Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.  
There have been lovers who thought love should be  
So much compounded of high courtesy  
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks  
Precedents out of beautiful old books;  
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'

We sat grown quiet at the name of love,  
We saw the last embers of daylight die  
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky  
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>  
Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell  
About the stars and broke in days and years.

I had a thought for no one's but your ears  
That you were beautiful and that I strove  
To love you in the old high way of love  
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown  
As weary hearted as that hollow moon.
