### THE WITHERING OF THE BOUGHS.

I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds,  
'Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will,  
I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words,  
For the roads are unending and there is no place to my mind.'  
The honey-pale Moon lay low on the sleepy hill  
And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams;  
No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,  
The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.

I know of the leafy paths that the witches take,  
Who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool, <span

And their secret smile, out of the depths of the lake;  
And of apple islands where the Danaan kind  
Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool  
On the island lawns, their feet where the pale foam gleams;  
No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,  
The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.

I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round  
Coupled with golden chains and sing as they fly,  
A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound  
Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so blind  
With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone by;  
I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of streams;  
No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,  
The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.
