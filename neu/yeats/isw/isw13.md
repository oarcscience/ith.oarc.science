I made some of these poems walking about among the Seven Woods, before
the big wind of nineteen hundred and three blew down so many trees, &
troubled the wild creatures, & changed the look of things; and I thought
out there a good part of the play which follows. The first shape of it
came to me in a dream, but it changed much in the making, foreshadowing,
it may be, a change that may bring a less dream-burdened will into my
verses. I never re-wrote anything so many times; for at first I could
not make these wills that stream into mere life poetical. But now I hope
to do easily much more of the kind, and that our new Irish players will
find the buskin and the sock.
