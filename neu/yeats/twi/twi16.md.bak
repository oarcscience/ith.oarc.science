# 'AND FAIR, FIERCE WOMEN'

ONE day a woman that I know came face to face with heroic beauty, that
highest beauty which Blake says changes least from youth to age, a
beauty which has been fading out of the arts, since that decadence we
call progress, set voluptuous beauty in its place. She was standing at
the window, looking over to Knocknarea where Queen Maive is thought to
be buried, when she saw, as she has told me, 'the finest woman you ever
saw travelling right across from the mountain and straight to her.' The
woman had a sword by her side and a dagger lifted up in her hand, and
was dressed in white, with bare arms and feet. She looked 'very strong,
but not wicked,' that is, not cruel. The old woman had seen the Irish
giant, and 'though he was a fine man,' he was nothing to this woman,
'for he was round, and could not have stepped out so soldierly'; 'she
was like Mrs.-----' a

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

stately lady of the neighbourhood, 'but she had no stomach on her, and
was slight and broad in the shoulders, and was handsomer than any one
you ever saw; she looked about thirty.' The old woman covered her eyes
with her hands, and when she uncovered them the apparition had vanished.
The neighbours were 'wild with her,' she told me, because she did not
wait to find out if there was a message, for they were sure it was Queen
Maive, who often shows herself to the pilots. I asked the old woman if
she had seen others like Queen Maive, and she said, 'Some of them have
their hair down, but they look quite different, like the sleepy-looking
ladies one sees in the papers. Those with their hair up are like this
one. The others have long white dresses, but those with their hair up
have short dresses, so that you can see their legs right up to the
calf.' After some careful questioning I found that they wore what might
very well be a kind of buskin; she

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

went on, 'They are fine and dashing looking, like the men one sees
riding their horses in twos and threes on the slopes of the mountains
with their swords swinging.' She repeated over and over, 'There is no
such race living now, none so finely proportioned,' or the like, and
then said, 'The present Queen <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) is a
nice, pleasant-looking woman, but she is not like her. What makes me
think so little of the ladies is that I see none as they be,' meaning as
the spirits. 'When I think of her and of the ladies now, they are like
little children running about without knowing how to put their clothes
on right. Is it the ladies? Why, I would not call them women at all.'
The other day a friend of mine questioned an old woman in a Galway
workhouse about Queen Maive, and was told that 'Queen Maive was
handsome, and overcame all her enemies with a bawl stick, for the hazel
is blessed, and the best weapon that can be got. You might

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

walk the world with it,' but she grew 'very disagreeable in the end--oh
very disagreeable. Best not to be talking about it. Best leave it
between the book and the hearer.' My friend thought the old woman had
got some scandal about Fergus son of Roy and Maive in her head.

And I myself met once with a young man in the Burren Hills who
remembered an old poet who made his poems in Irish and had met when he
was young, the young man said, one who called herself Maive, and said
she was a queen 'among them,' and asked him if he would have money or
pleasure. He said he would have pleasure, and she gave him her love for
a time, and then went from him, and ever after he was very mournful. The
young man had often heard him sing the poem of lamentation that he made,
but could only remember that it was 'very mournful,' and that he called
her 'beauty of all beauties.'
