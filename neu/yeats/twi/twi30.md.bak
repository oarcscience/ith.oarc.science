# THE THICK SKULL OF THE FORTUNATE

### I

ONCE a number of Icelandic peasantry found a very thick skull in the
cemetery where the poet Egil was buried. Its great thickness made them
feel certain it was the skull of a great man, doubtless of Egil himself.
To be doubly sure they put it on a wall and hit it hard blows with a
hammer. It got white where the blows fell but did not break, and they
were convinced that it was in truth the skull of the poet, and worthy of
every honour. In Ireland we have much kinship with the Icelanders, or
'Danes' as we call them and all other dwellers in the Scandinavian
countries. In some of our mountainous and barren places, and in our
seaboard villages, we still test each other in much the same way the
Icelanders tested the head of Egil. We may have acquired the custom from
those ancient Danish pirates,

whose descendants the people of Rosses tell me still remember every
field and hillock in Ireland which once belonged to their forebears, and
are able to describe Rosses itself as well as any native. There is one
seaboard district known as Roughley, where the men are never known to
shave or trim their wild red beards, and where there is a fight ever on
foot. I have seen them at a boat-race fall foul of each other, and after
much loud Gaelic, strike each other with oars. The first boat had gone
aground, and by dint of hitting out with the long oars kept the second
boat from passing, only to give the victory to the third. One day the
Sligo people say a man from Roughley was tried in Sligo for breaking a
skull in a row, and made the defence not unknown in Ireland, that some
heads are so thin you cannot be responsible for them. Having turned with
a look of passionate contempt towards the solicitor who was prosecuting,
and cried, 'that little fellow's skull if ye were to hit

it would go like an egg-shell,' he beamed upon the judge, and said in a
wheedling voice, 'but a man might wallop away at your lordship's for a
fortnight.'

### II

I wrote all this years ago, out of what were even then old memories. I
was in Roughley the other day, and found it much like other desolate
places. I may have been thinking of Moughorow, a much wilder place, for
the memories of one's childhood are brittle things to lean upon.
