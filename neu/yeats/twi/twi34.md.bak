# OUR LADY OF THE HILLS

WHEN we were children we did not say at such a distance from the
post-office, or so far from the butcher's or the grocer's, but measured
things by the covered well in the wood, or by the burrow of the fox in
the hill. We belonged then to God and to His works, and to things come
down from the ancient days. We would not have been greatly surprised had
we met the shining feet of an angel among the white mushrooms upon the
mountains, for we knew in those days immense despair, unfathomed
love--every eternal mood,--but now the draw-net is about our feet. A few
miles eastward of Lough Gill, a young Protestant girl, who was both
pretty herself and prettily dressed in blue and white, wandered up among
those mountain mushrooms, and I have a letter of hers telling how she
met a troop of children, and became a portion of their dream. When they
first saw her

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

they threw themselves face down in a bed of rushes, as if in a great
fear; but after a little other children came about them, and they got up
and followed her almost bravely. She noticed their fear, and presently
stood still and held out her arms. A little girl threw herself into them
with the cry, 'Ah, you are the Virgin out o’ the picture!' 'No,' said
another, coming near also, 'she is a sky faery, for she has the colour
of the sky.' 'No,' said a third, 'she is the faery out of the foxglove
grown big.' The other children, however, would have it that she was
indeed the Virgin, for she wore the Virgin's colours. Her good
Protestant heart was greatly troubled, and she got the children to sit
down about her, and tried to explain who she was, but they would have
none of her explanation. Finding explanation of no avail, she asked had
they ever heard of Christ? 'Yes,' said one; 'but we do not like Him, for
He would kill us if it were not for the Virgin.' 'Tell Him to be good to
me,'

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

whispered another into her ear. 'We would not let me near Him, for dad
says I am a divil,' burst out a third.

She talked to them a long time about Christ and the apostles, but was
finally interrupted by an elderly woman with a stick, who, taking her to
be some adventurous hunter for converts, drove the children away,
despite their explanation that here was the great Queen of Heaven come
to walk upon the mountain and be kind to them. When the children had
gone she went on her way, and had walked about half-a-mile, when the
child who was called 'a divil' jumped down from the high ditch by the
lane, and said she would believe her 'an ordinary lady' if she had 'two
skirts,' for 'ladies always had two skirts.' The 'two skirts' were
shown, and the child went away crestfallen, but a few minutes later
jumped down again from the ditch, and cried angrily, 'Dad's a divil,
mum's a divil, and I'm a divil, and you are only an ordinary

lady,' and having flung a handful of mud and pebbles ran away sobbing.
When my pretty Protestant had come to her own home she found that she
had dropped the tassels of her parasol. A year later she was by chance
upon the mountain, but wearing now a plain black dress, and met the
child who had first called her the Virgin out o' the picture, and saw
the tassels hanging about the child's neck, and said, 'I am the lady you
met last year, who told you about Christ.' 'No, you are not! no, you are
not! no, you are not!' was the passionate reply. And after all, it was
not my pretty Protestant, but Mary, Star of the Sea, still walking in
sadness and in beauty upon many a mountain and by many a shore, who cast
those tassels at the feet of the child. It is indeed fitting that man
pray to her who is the mother of peace, the mother of dreams, and the
mother of purity, to leave them yet a little hour to do good and evil
in, and to watch old Time telling the rosary of the stars.
