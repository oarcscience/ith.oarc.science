# ARISTOTLE OF THE BOOKS

THE friend who can get the wood-cutter to talk more readily than he will
to anybody else went lately to see his old wife. She lives in a cottage
not far from the edge of the woods, and is as full of old talk as her
husband. This time she began to talk of Goban, the legendary mason, and
his wisdom, but said presently, 'Aristotle of the Books, too, was very
wise, and he had a great deal of experience, but did not the bees get
the better of him in the end? He wanted to know how they packed the
comb, and he wasted the better part of a fortnight watching them, and he
could not see them doing it. Then he made a hive with a glass cover on
it and put it over them, and he thought to see. But when he went and put
his eyes to the glass, they had it all covered with wax so that it was
as black as the pot; and he was as blind as before. He said he was never
rightly kilt till then. They had him that time surely!'

1902\.
