# AN ENDURING HEART

ONE day a friend of mine was making a sketch of my Knight of the Sheep.
The old man's daughter was sitting by, and, when the conversation
drifted to love and lovemaking, she said, 'Oh, father, tell him about
your love affair.' The old man took his pipe out of his mouth, and said,
'Nobody ever marries the woman he loves,' and then, with a chuckle,
'There were fifteen of them I liked better than the woman I married,'
and he repeated many women's names. He went on to tell how when he was a
lad he had worked for his grandfather, his mother's father, and was
called (my friend has forgotten why) by his grandfather's name, which we
will say was Doran. He had a great friend, whom I shall call John Byrne;
and one day he and his friend went to Queenstown to await an emigrant
ship, that was to take John Byrne to America. When they were walking
along the quay, they

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

saw a girl sitting on a seat, crying miserably, and two men standing up
in front of her quarrelling with one another. Doran said, 'I think I
know what is wrong. *That* man will be her brother, and *that* man will
be her lover, and the brother is sending her to America to get her away
from the lover. How she is crying! but I think I could console her
myself.' Presently the lover and brother went away, and Doran began to
walk up and down before her, saying, 'Mild weather, Miss,' or the like.
She answered him in a little while, and the three began to talk
together. The emigrant ship did not arrive for some days; and the three
drove about on outside cars very innocently and happily, seeing
everything that was to be seen. When at last the ship came, and Doran
had to break it to her that he was not going to America, she cried more
after him than after the first lover. Doran whispered to Byrne as he
went aboard

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

ship, 'Now, Byrne, I don't grudge her to you, but don't marry young.'

When the story got to this, the farmer's daughter joined In mockingly
with, 'I suppose you said that for Byrne's good, father.' But the old
man insisted that he had said it for Byrne's good; and went on to tell
how, when he got a letter telling of Byrne's engagement to the girl, he
wrote him the same advice. Years passed by, and he heard nothing; and
though he was now married, he could not keep from wondering what she was
doing. At last he went to America to find out, and though he asked many
people for tidings, he could get none. More years went by, and his wife
was dead, and he well on in years, and a rich farmer with not a few
great matters on his hands. He found an excuse in some vague business to
go out to America again, and to begin his search again. One day he fell
into talk with an Irishman in a railway carriage,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

and asked him, as his way was, about emigrants from this place and that,
and at last, 'Did you ever hear of the miller's daughter from Innis
Rath?' and he named the woman he was looking for. 'Oh yes,' said the
other, 'she is married to a friend of mine, John MacEwing. She lives at
such-and-such a street in Chicago.' Doran went to Chicago and knocked at
her door. She opened the door herself, and was 'not a bit changed.' He
gave her his real name, which he had taken again after his grandfather's
death, and the name of the man he had met in the train. She did not
recognize him, but asked him to stay to dinner, saying that her husband
would be glad to meet anybody who knew that old friend of his. They
talked of many things, but for all their talk, I do not know why, and
perhaps he did not know why, he never told her who he was. At dinner he
asked her about Byrne, and she put her head down on the table and began
to cry, and she cried so he was afraid her

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

husband might be angry. He was afraid to ask what had happened to Byrne,
and left soon after, never to see her again.

When the old man had finished the story, he said, 'Tell that to Mr.
Yeats, he will make a poem about it, perhaps.' But the daughter said,
'Oh no, father. Nobody could make a poem about a woman like that.' Alas!
I have never made the poem, perhaps because my own heart, which has
loved Helen and all the lovely and fickle women of the world, would be
too sore. There are things it is well not to ponder over too much,
things that bare words are the best suited for.

1902\.
