# THE MAN AND HIS BOOTS

THERE was a doubter in Donegal, and he would not hear of ghosts or
sheogues, and there was a house in Donegal that had been haunted as long
as man could remember, and this is the story of how the house got the
better of the man. The man came into the house and lighted a fire in the
room under the haunted one, and took off his boots and set them On the
hearth, and stretched out his feet and warmed him self. For a time he
prospered in his unbelief; but a little while after the night had
fallen, and everything had got very dark, one of his boots began to
move. It got up off the floor and gave a kind of slow jump towards the
door, and then the other boot did the same, and after that the first
boot jumped again. And thereupon it struck the man that an invisible
being had got into his boots, and was now going away in them. When the
boots reached the door they went up-stairs

slowly, and then the man heard them go tramp, tramp round the haunted
room over his head. A few minutes passed, and he could hear them again
upon the stairs, and after that in the passage outside, and then one of
them came in at the door, and the other gave a jump past it and came in
too. They jumped along towards him, and then one got up and hit him, and
afterwards the other hit him, and then again the first hit him, and so
on, until they drove him out of the room, and finally out of the house.
In this way he was kicked out by his own boots, and Donegal was avenged
upon its doubter. It is not recorded whether the invisible being was a
ghost or one of the Sidhe, but the fantastic nature of the vengeance is
like the work of the Sidhe who live in the heart of fantasy.
