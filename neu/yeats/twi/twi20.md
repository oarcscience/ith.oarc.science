# THE SWINE OF THE GODS

A FEW years ago a friend of mine told me of something that happened to
him when he was a. young man and out drilling with some Connaught
Fenians. They were but a car-full, and drove along a hillside until they
came to a quiet place. They left the car and went further up the hill
with their rifles, and drilled for a while. As they were coming down
again they saw a very thin, long-legged pig of the old Irish sort, and
the pig began to follow them. One of them cried out as a joke that it
was a fairy pig, and they all began to run to keep up the joke. The pig
ran too, and presently, how nobody knew, this mock terror became real
terror, and they ran as for their lives. When they got to the car they
made the horse gallop as fast as possible, but the pig still followed.
Then one of them put up his rifle to fire, but when he looked along the
barrel he could see nothing. Presently they turned

a corner and came to a village. They told the people of the village what
had happened, and the people of the village took pitchforks and spades
and the like, and went along the road with them to drive the pig away.
When they turned the corner they could not find anything.
