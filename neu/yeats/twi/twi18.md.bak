# MIRACULOUS CREATURES

THERE are marten cats and badgers and foxes in the Enchanted Woods, but
there are of a certainty mightier creatures, and the lake hides what
neither net nor fine can take. These creatures are of the race of the
white stag that flits in and out of the tales of Arthur, and of the evil
pig that slew Diarmuid where Ben Bulben mixes with the sea wind. They
are the wizard creatures of hope and fear, they are of them that fly and
of them that follow among the thickets that are about the Gates of
Death. A man I know remembers that his father was one night in the wood
Of Inchy, 'where the lads of Gort used to be stealing rods. He was
sitting by the wall, and the dog beside him, and he heard something come
running from Owbawn Weir, and he could see nothing, but the sound of its
feet on the ground was like the sound of the feet of a deer. And when it
passed him, the dog got

between him and the wall and scratched at it there as if it was afraid,
but still he could see nothing but only hear the sound of hoofs. So when
it was passed he turned and came away home.' 'Another time,' the man
says, 'my father told me he was in a boat out on the lake with two or
three men from Gort, and one of them had an eel-spear, and he thrust it
into the water, and it hit something, and the man fainted and they had
to carry him out of the boat to land, and when he came to himself he
said that what he struck was like a calf, but whatever it was, it was
not fish!' A friend of mine is convinced that these terrible creatures,
so common in lakes, were set there in old times by subtle enchanters to
watch over the gates of wisdom. He thinks that if we sent our spirits
down into the water we would make them of one substance with strange
moods of ecstasy and power, and go out it may be to the conquest of the
world. We would, however, he believes, have first to outface

and perhaps overthrow strange images full of a more powerful life than
if they were really alive. It may be that we shall look at them without
fear when we have endured the last adventure, that is death.
