# THE EATERS OF PRECIOUS STONES

SOMETIMES when I have been shut off from common interests, and have for
a little forgotten to be restless, I get waking dreams, now faint and
shadow-like, now vivid and solid-looking, like the material world under
my feet. Whether they be faint or vivid, they are ever beyond the power
of my will to alter in any way. They have their own will, and sweep
hither and thither, and change according to its commands. One day I saw
faintly an immense pit of blackness, round which went a circular
parapet, and on this parapet sat innumerable apes eating precious stones
out of the palms of their hands. The stones glittered green and crimson,
and the apes devoured them with an insatiable hunger. I knew that I saw

avid a thirst, lost peace and form and became shapeless and common. I
have seen into other people's hells also, and saw in one an infernal
Peter, who had a black face and white lips, and who weighed on a curious
double scales not only the evil deeds committed, but the good deeds left
undone, of certain invisible shades. I could see the scales go up and
down, but I could not see the shades who were, I knew, crowding about
him. I saw on another occasion a quantity of demons of all kinds of
shapes--fish-like, serpent-like, ape-like, and dog-like--sitting about a
black pit such as that in my own Hell, and looking at a moon--like
reflection of the Heavens which shone up from the depths of the pit.
