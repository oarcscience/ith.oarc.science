This etext corresponds to the second (1902) expanded edition of the
*Celtic Twilight*. This is one of the best-known collections of Yeats'
prose; in it he explores the longstanding connection between the people
of Ireland and the inhabitants of the land of Fairy. Yeats, who had
profound mystic and visionary beliefs, writes with conviction of the
reality of Fairies, both in his own experience, and in the everyday life
of the Irish. This relatively short work serves as a way for readers to
discover Yeats' powerful wordcraft and get an overview of celtic Fairy
lore.

This etext, created at Intangible Textual Heritage in 2001, was revised
in January 2004 from an original copy of the 1902 edition, to include
page numbers and correspond more closely to the formatting of the
original, and to correct a few transcription errors. It was reformatted
in 2009. The Project Gutenberg version of *Celtic Twilight* is based on
the sacred-texts version.
