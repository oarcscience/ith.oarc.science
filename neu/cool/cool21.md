21\. Cuchulain and the Rivers

Then came certain men of the Ulstermen thither to help and succour
Cuchulain. Before all, Senoll Uathach and the two sons of Gegè: Muridach
and Cotreb, to wit. And they bore him to the streams and rivers of
Conalle Murthemni, to rub and to wash his stabs and his cuts, his sores
and his many wounds in the face of these streams and rivers. For the
Tuatha De Danann were wont to put herbs and plants of healing and a
curing charm in the waters and rivers of the territory of Conalle
Murthemni, to help and to succour Cuchulain, so that the streams were
speckled and green-topped therewith.

Accordingly these are the names of the healing rivers of Cuchulain:

Sas, Buan, Buas, Bithslan, Findglas ('Whitewater'), Gleoir, Glenamain,
Bedg, Tadg, Telameit, Rind, Bir, Brenidè, Dichaem, Muach, Miliuc,
Cumung, Cuilind, Gainemain, Drong, Delt, Dubglas ('Blackwater').
