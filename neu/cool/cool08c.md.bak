8c. The Killing of The Squirrel And of The Tame Bird

Then Cuchulain made a threat in Methe that wherever he saw Medb he would
cast a stone at her and that it would not go far from the side of her
head. That he also fulfilled. In the place where he saw Medb west of the
ford he cast a stone from his sling at her, so that it killed the pet
bird that was on her shoulder.

Medb passed over the ford eastwards, and again he cast a stone from his
sling at her east of the ford, so that it killed the tame squirrel that
was on her shoulder. Hence the names of those places are still, Meide in
Togmail ('Squirrel's Neck') and Meide ind Eoin ('Bird's Neck'). And Ath
Srethe ('Ford of the Throw') is the name of the ford over which
Cuchulain cast the stone from his sling.

Then did the men of Erin deliberate about going to ravage and lay waste
Mag Breg and Meath and the plain of Conall and the land of Cuchulain;
and it was in the presence of Fergus macRoig they discussed it.

The four grand provinces of Erin moved out on the morrow, and began to
harry the plains of Breg and Murthemne. And the sharp, keen-edged
anxiety for Cuchulain came over his fosterer Fergus. And he bade the men
of Erin be on their guard that night, for that Cuchulain would come upon
them. And here again he sang in his praise, as we wrote it before, and
he uttered the lay:--

> "If Cuchulain, Cualnge's Hound,  
> And Red Branch chiefs on you come,  
> Men will welter in their blood,  
> Laying waste Murthemne's plain!

> "Far away he held his course,  
> Till he reached Armenia's heights;  
> Battle dared he, past his wont,  
> And the Burnt-breasts put to death!

> Hardest for him was to drive  
> Necht's sons from their chieftest haunts;  
> And the smith's hound-- mighty deed--  
> Hath he slain with single hand!

> "More than this I've naught to say,  
> As concerns Dechtird's son;  
> My belief, in troth, is this:  
> Ye will now meet with your fate."

After this lay, that was the day that Donn ('the Brown Bull') of Cualnge
came into the land of Marginè to Sliab Culinn and with him fifty heifers
of the heifers of Ulster; and there he was pawing and digging up the
earth in that place, in the land of Marginè, in Cualnge; that is, he
flung the turf over him with his heels.

It was on the same day that the Morrigan, daughter of Ernmas, the
prophetess of the fairy-folk, came in the form of a bird, and she
perched on the standing-stone in Temair of Cualnge giving the Brown Bull
of Cualnge warning end lamentations before the men of Erin. Then she
began to address him and what she said was this: "Good, now, O luckless
one, thou Brown Bull of Cualnge," so spake the Morrigan; "take heed; for
the men of Erin are on thy track and seeking thee and they will come
upon thee, and if thou art taken they will carry thee away to their camp
like any ox on a raid, unless thou art on thy guard." And she commenced
to give warning to him in this fashion, and she delivered this judgement
and spake these words aloud:--

> "Knows not the restless Brown of the truly deadly fray that is not
> uncertain?-- A raven's croak-- The raven that doth not conceal-- Foes
> range your checkered plain-- Troops on raids-- I have a secret-- Ye
> shall know. . . The waving fields-- The deep-green grass . . . and
> rich, soft plain-- Wealth of flowers' splendour-- Badb's cow-lowing--
> Wild the raven-- Dead the men-- A tale of woe-- Battle-storm on
> Cualnge evermore, to the death of mighty sons-- Kith looking on the
> death of kin!"

When the Brown Bull of Cualnge heard those words he moved on to Glenn na
Samaisce ('Heifers' Glen') in Sliab Culinn ('Hollymount'), and fifty of
his heifers with him.

This was one of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of Cualnge: Fifty
heifers he would cover every day. These calved before that same hour on
the next day and such of them that calved not at the due time burst with
the calves, because they could not suffer the begetting of the Brown
Bull of Cualnge. One of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of Cualnge
were the fifty grown youths who engaged in games, who on his fine back
found room every evening to play. Another of the magic virtues of the
Brown Bull of Cualnge was the hundred warriors he screened from the heat
and the cold under his shadow and shelter.

Another of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of Cualnge was that no
goblin nor boggart nor sprite of the glen dared come into one and the
same cantred with him. Another of the magic virtues of the Brown Bull of
Cualnge was his musical lowing every evening as he returned to his
haggard, his shed and his byre. It was music enough and delight for a
man in the north and in the south, in the east and the west, and in the
middle of the cantred of Cualnge, the lowing he made at even as he came
to his haggard, his shed, and his byre. These, then, are some of the
magic virtues of the Brown Bull of Cualnge.

Thereupon on the morrow the hosts proceeded among the rocks and dunes of
the land of Conalle Murthemni. And Medb ordered a canopy of shields to
be held over her head in order that Cuchulain might not strike her from
the hills or hillocks or heights. Howbeit on that day, no killing nor
attack came from Cuchulain upon the men of Erin, in the land of
Murthemne among the rocks and dunes of Conalle Murthemni.
