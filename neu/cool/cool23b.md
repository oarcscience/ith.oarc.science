23b. Here Followeth the Accoutrement of the Charioteers

Then came the charioteers of the Ulstermen to them. Thrice fifty was
their number. They offered three battles to the hosts. Thrice their
number fell at their hands, and the charioteers themselves fell on the
field whereon they stood. Hence this here is called the 'Accoutrement of
the Charioteers \[with stones.\]'
