8d. The Slaying Of Lochè

The warriors of four of the five grand provinces of Erin bided their
time in Rede Lochè in Cualnge and pitched camp and took quarters therein
for that night. Medb bade her fair handmaiden from amongst her
attendants to go for her to the river for water for drinking and
washing. Lochè was the name of the maiden. Thereupon Lochè went, and
fifty women in her train and the queen's diadem of gold on her head.

And Cuchulain espied them and he put a stone on his sling and cast a
stone from his staff-sling at her, so that he broke the diadem of gold
in three pieces and killed the maiden on her plain. Thence is Redè Lochè
('the Plain of Lochè') in Cualnge. For Cuchulain had thought, for want
of acquaintance and knowledge, that it was Medb that was there.
