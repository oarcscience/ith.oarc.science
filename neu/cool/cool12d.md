12d. Here The Combat of Munremar and Curoi

While the hosts were there in the evening they perceived that one stone
fell on them coming from the east and another from the west to meet it.
The stones met one another in the air and kept falling between Fergus'
camp, the camp of Ailill and the camp of Nera. This sport and play
continued from that hour till the same hour on the next day, and the
hosts spent the time sitting down, with their shields over their heads
to protect them from the blocks of stones, till the plain was full of
the boulders, whence cometh Mag Clochair ('the Stony Plain').

Now it happened it was Curoi macDar√® did this. He had come to bring help
to his people and had taken his stand in Cotal to fight against Munremar
son of Gerrcend. The latter had come from Emain Macha to succour
Cuchulain and had taken his stand on Ard ('the Height') of Roch. Curoi
knew there was not in the host a man to compete with Munremar. These
then it was who carried on this sport between them. The army prayed them
to cease. Whereupon Munremar and Curoi made peace, and Curoi withdrew to
his house and Munremar to Emain Macha and Munremar came not again till
the day of the battle. As for Curoi, he came not till the combat of
Ferdiad.

"Pray Cuchulain," said Medb and Ailill, "that he suffer us to change our
place." This then was granted to them and the change was made.

The 'Pains' of the Ulstermen left them then. When now they awoke from
their 'Pains,' bands of them came continually upon the host to restrain
it again.
