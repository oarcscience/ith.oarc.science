12e. The Slaughter of The Boy-Troop

Now the youths of Ulster discussed the matter among themselves in Emain
Macha. "Alas for us," said they, "that our friend Cuchulain has no one
to succour him!" "I would ask then," spake Fiachu Fulech ('the Bloody')
son of Ferfebè and own brother to Fiachu Fialdana ('the
Generous-daring') son of Ferfebè, "shall I have a company from you to go
to him with help?"

Thrice fifty youths accompany him with their play-clubs, and that was a
third of the boy-troop of Ulster. The army saw them drawing near them
over the plain. "A great army approaches us over the plain," spake
Ailill. Fergus goes to espy them. "Some of the youths of Ulster are
they," said he, "and it is to succour Cuchulain they come." "Let a troop
go to meet them," said Ailill, "unknown to Cuchulain; for if they unite
with him ye will never overcome them." Thrice fifty warriors went out to
meet them. They fell at one another's hands, so that not one of them got
off alive of the number of the youths of Lia Toll. Hence is Lia ('the
Stone') of Fiachu son of Ferfebè, for it is there that he fell.

"Take counsel," quoth Ailill; "inquire of Cuchulain about letting you go
from hence, for ye will not go past him by force, now that his flame of
valour has risen." For it was usual with him, when his hero's flame
arose in him, that his feet would turn back on him and his buttocks
before him, and the knobs of his calves would come on his shins, and one
eye would be in his head and the other one out of his head. A man's head
would have gone into his mouth. There was not a hair on him that was not
as sharp as the thorn of the hew, and a drop of blood was on each single
hair. He would recognize neither comrades nor friends. Alike he would
strike them before and behind. Therefrom it was that the men of Connacht
gave Cuchulain the name Riastartha ('the Contorted One').
