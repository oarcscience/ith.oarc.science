9\. The Proposals

The four grand provinces of Erin proceeded till they pitched camp and
took quarters in Druim En ('Birds' Ridge') in the land of Conalle
Murthemni, and they slept there that night, and Cuchulain held himself
at Ferta Illergaib ('the Burial-mound on the Slopes') hard by them that
night, and he, Cuchulain, shook, brandished and flourished his weapons
that night, so that one hundred warriors of the host perished of fright
and fear and dread of Cuchulain.

Medb called upon Fiachu son of Ferfebè of the Ulstermen to go parley
with Cuchulain, to come to some terms with him. "What terms shall be
given him?" asked Fiachu son of Ferfebè. "Not hard to answer," Medb
replied: "He shall be recompensed for the loss of his lands and estates,
for whosoever has been slain of the Ulstermen, so that it be paid to him
as the men of Erin adjudge. Entertainment shall be his at all times in
Cruachan; wine and mead shall be poured out for him. And he shall come
into my service and Ailill's, for that is more seemly for him than to be
in the service of the lordling with whom he is.

Accordingly this was the greatest word of scorn and insult spoken on the
Cow-Raid of Cualnge, to make a lordling of the best king of a province
in Erin, even of Conchobar.

Then came Fiachu son of Ferfebè to converse with Cuchulain. Cuchulain
bade him welcome. "I regard that welcome as truly meant," said Fiachu.
"It is truly meant for thee," replied Cuchulain. "Not for hospitality am
I come, but to parley with thee am I come from Medb, and to bring thee
terms." "What hast thou brought with thee?"

"Thou shalt be recompensed for whatsoever was destroyed of Ulster which
shall be paid thee as best the men of Erin adjudge. Entertainment shalt
thou enjoy in Cruachan; wine and mead shall be poured out for thee and
thou shalt enter the service of Ailill and Medb, for that is more seemly
for thee than to be in the service of the lordling with whom thou art."
"Nay, of a truth," answered Cuchulain, "I would not sell my mother's
brother for any other king!" "Further," continued Fiachu, "that thou
comest to-morrow to a tryst with Medb and Fergus in Glenn Fochaine.

Accordingly, early on the morrow, Cuchulain set forth for Glenn
Fochaine. Likewise Medb and Fergus went to meet him. And Medb looked
narrowly at Cuchulain, and her spirit chafed her at him that day, for no
bigger than the bulk of a stripling did he seem to her. "Is that yonder
the renowned Cuchulain thou speakest of, O Fergus?" asked Medb. And Medb
began to address Fergus and she made this lay:--

> M: "If that be the noble Hound,  
> Of whom ye of Ulster boast,  
> What man e'er stout foe hath faced  
> Will fend him from Erin's men!"

> F: "Howe'er young the Hound thou seest  
> That Murthemne's Plain cloth course,  
> That man hath not stood on earth  
> Whom he'd crush not with his might!"

> M: "We will bring this warrior terms;  
> If he slight them, he is mad:  
> Half his cows, his women, half.  
> He shall change his way of fight! "

> F: "My wish, that ye'll not o'ercome  
> This Hound from proud Murthemne!  
> Deeds he fears not-- fierce and bright--  
> This I know, if it be he!"

"Accost Cuchulain, O Fergus," said Medb. "Nay, then," quoth Fergus, "but
do thou accost him thyself, for ye are not asunder here in the valley,
in Glenn Fochaine." And Medb began to address Cuchulain and she made a
lay, to which he responded:

> M: "Culann's Hound, whom quatrains praise,  
> Keep thy staff-sling far from us;  
> Thy fierce, famed fight hath us ruined,  
> Hath us broken and confused!"

> C: "Medb of Mur, he, Maga's son,  
> No base arrant wight am I.  
> While I live I'll never cease  
> Cualnge's raid to harass sore!"

> M: "If thou wilt take this from us,  
> Valiant chief, thou Cualnge's Hound;  
> Half thy cows; thy women, half,  
> Thou shalt have through fear of thee!"

> C: "As by right of thrusts am I  
> Ulster's champion and defence,  
> Naught I'll yield till I retrieve  
> Cow and woman ta'en from Gael! "

> M: "What thou askest is too much,  
> After slaughtering our fair troops,  
> That we keep but steeds and gauds,  
> All because of one sole man! "

> C: "Eocho's daughter, fair, of Fal,  
> I'm not good at wars of words;  
> Though a warrior-- fair the cheer--  
> Counsel mine is little worth! "

> M: "Shame thou hast none for what thou sayest  
> O Dechtire's lordly son!  
> Famous are the terms for thee,  
> O thou battling Culann's Hound!"

When this lay was finished, Cuchulain accepted none of the terms which
she had offered. In such wise they parted in the valley and withdrew in
equal anger on the one side and on the other.

The warriors of four of the five grand provinces of Erin pitched camp
and took quarters for three days and three nights at Druim En ('Birds'
Ridge') in Conalle Murthemni, but neither huts nor tents did they set
up, nor did they engage in feasts or repasts, nor sang they songs nor
carols those three nights. And Cuchulain destroyed a hundred of their
warriors every night ere the bright hour of sunrise on the morrow.

"Our hosts will not last long in this fashion," said Medb, "if Cuchulain
slays a hundred of our warriors every night. Wherefore is a proposal not
made to him and do we not parley with him?" "What might the proposal
be?" asked Ailill. "Let the cattle that have milk be given to him and
the captive women from amongst our booty. And he on his side shall check
his staff-sling from the men of Erin and give leave to the hosts to
sleep, even though he slay them by day."

"Who shall go with that proposal?" Ailill asked. "Who," answered Medb,
"but macRoth the chief runner!" "Nay, but I will not go," said macRoth,
"for I am in no way experienced and know not where Cuchulain may be, and
even though I should meet him, I should not know him." "Ask Fergus,"
quoth Medb; "like enough he knows where he is." "Nay, then, I know it
not," answered Fergus; "but I trow he is in the snow between Fochain and
the sea, taking the wind and the sun after his sleeplessness last night,
killing and slaughtering the host single handed." And so it truly was.

Then on that errand to Delga macRoth set forth, the messenger of Ailill
and Medb. He it is that circles Erin in one day. There it is that Fergus
opined that Cuchulain would be, in Delga.

Heavy snow fell that night so that all the five provinces of Erin were a
white plane with the snow. And Cuchulain doffed the seven-score waxed,
boardlike tunics which were used to be held under cords and strings next
his skin, in order that his sense might not be deranged when the fit of
his fury came on him. And the snow melted for thirty feet all around
him, because of the intensity of the warrior's heat and the warmth of
Cuchulain's body. And the gilla remained a good distance from him for he
could not endure to remain near him because of the might of his rage and
the warrior's fury and the heat of his body.

"A single warrior approacheth, O Cuchulain," cried Laeg to Cuchulain.
"What manner of warrior is he?" asked Cuchulain. "A brown, broad-faced,
handsome fellow; a splendid, brown, hooded cloak, about him; a fine,
bronze pin in his cloak; a leathern three-striped doublet next his skin;
two gapped shoes between his two feet and the ground; a white-hazel
dog-staff in one of his hands; a single-edged sword with ornaments of
walrus-tooth on its hilt in the other. "Good, O gilla," quoth Cuchulain,
"these be the tokens of a herald. One of the heralds of Erin is he to
bring me message and offer of parley."

Now was macRoth arrived at the place where Laeg was. "How now! What is
thy title as vassal, O gilla?" macRoth asked. "Vassal am I to the youth
up yonder," the gilla made answer. MacRoth came to the place where
Cuchulain was. "How now! What is thy name as vassal, O warrior?" asked
macRoth. "Vassal am I to Conchobar son of Fachtna Fathach, son of the
High King of this province." "Hast not something, a name more special
than that?" "'Tis enough for the nonce," answered Cuchulain.

"Haply, thou knowest where I might find that famous Cuchulain of whom
the men of Erin clamour now on this foray?" "What wouldst thou say to
him that thou wouldst not to me?" asked Cuchulain. "To parley with him
am I come on the part of Ailill and Medb, with terms and friendly
intercourse for him." "What terms hast thou brought with thee for him?"
"The milch-kine and the bondwomen of the booty he shall have, and for
him to hold back his staff-sling from the hosts, for not pleasant is the
thunder-feat he works every evening upon them."

"Even though the one thou seekest were really at hand, he would not
accept the proposals thou askest." "For the Ulstermen, in reprisal for
injuries and satires and hindrances, will kill for meat in the winter
the milch-cows ye have captured, should they happen to have no yeld
cattle. And, what is more, they will bring their bondwomen to bed to
them, and thus will grow up a base progeny on the side of the mothers in
the land of Ulster.

MacRoth went his way back. "What! Didst thou not find him?" Medb asked.
"Verily, I know not, but I found a surly, angry, hateful, wrathful gilla
in the snow betwixt Fochain and the sea. Sooth to say, I know not if he
were Cuchulain." "Hath he accepted these proposals from thee?" "Nay
then, he hath not." And macRoth related unto them all his answer, the
reason why he did not accept them. "It was he himself with whom thou
spakest," said Fergus.

"Another offer shall be made him," said Medb. "What is the offer?" asked
Ailill. "There shall be given to him the yeld cattle and the noblest of
the captive women of the booty, and his sling shall be checked from the
hosts, for not pleasant is the thunder-feat he works on them every
evening." "Who should go make this covenant?" said they. "Who but
macRoth the king's envoy," said every one. "Yea, I will go," said
macRoth, "because this time I know him."

Thereupon macRoth arose and came to parley with Cuchulain. "To parley
with thee am I come this time with other terms, for I wis it is thou art
the renowned Cuchulain." "What hast thou brought with thee now?"
Cuchulain asked. "What is dry of the kine and what is noblest of the
captives shalt thou get, and hold thy staff-sling from the men of Erin
and suffer the men of Erin to go to sleep, for not pleasant is the
thunder-feat thou workest upon them every evening."

"I accept not that offer, because, as amends for their honour, the
Ulstermen will kill the dry cattle. For the men of Ulster are honourable
men and they would remain wholly without dry kine and milch-kine. They
would bring their free women ye have captured to the querns and to the
kneading-troughs and into bondage and other serfdom besides. This would
be a disgrace. Loath I should be to leave after me this shame in Ulster,
that slave-girls and handmaids should be made of the daughters of kings
and princes of Ulster."

"Is there any offer at all thou wilt accept this time?" "Aye, but there
is," answered Cuchulain. "Then wilt thou tell me the offer?" asked
macRoth. "By my word," Cuchulain made answer, "'tis not I that will tell
you." "It is a question, then," said macRoth. "If there be among you in
the camp," said Cuchulain, "one that knows the terms I demand, let him
inform you, and I will abide thereby." "If there be not," said
Cuchulain, "let no one come near me any more with offers or with
friendly intercourse or concerning aught other injunction, for,
whosoever may come, it will be the term of his life! "

MacRoth came back, and Medb asked his tidings. "Didst thou find him?"
Medb asked. "In truth, I found him," macRoth replied. "Hath he accepted
the terms?" "He hath not accepted," replied macRoth. "Is there an offer
he will accept?" "There is one, he said," answered macRoth. "Hath he
made known to thee this offer?" "This is his word," said macRoth, "that
he himself would not disclose it to ye." "'Tis a question, then," said
Medb.

"But" (macRoth continued), "should there be one in our midst that knows
his terms, that one would tell it to me." "And if there be not, let no
one go seek him any more. But, there is one thing I promise thee," said
macRoth; "even though the kingdom of Erin were given me for it, I for
one would not go on these same legs to that place to parley with him
again."

Therewith Medb looked at Fergus. "What are the terms yonder man demands,
O Fergus?" Medb asked. "I know what the man meant to disclose. I see no
advantage at all for ye in the terms he demands," Fergus replied. "But
what are those terms?" asked Medb. "That a single champion of the men of
Erin be sent to fight and contend with him every day. The while he
slayeth that man, the army will be permitted to continue its march.
Then, when he will have slain that man, another warrior shall be sent to
meet him on the ford. Either that, or the men of Erin shall halt and
camp there till sunrise's bright hour in the morning. And further,
Cuchulain's food and clothing shall be provided by you, so long as he
will be on this expedition."

"By our conscience," said Ailill, "this is a grievous proposal." "What
he asks is good," replied Medb; "and he shall obtain those terms, for we
deem it easier to bear that he should have one of our warriors every day
than a hundred every night." "Who will go and make known those terms to
Cuchulain?" "Who, then, but Fergus?" replied Medb.

"Nevermore!" said Fergus. "Why not?" asked Ailill. "Bonds and covenants,
pledges and bail shall be given for abiding by those terms and for their
fulfillment towards Cuchulain." "I abide by it," said Medb, and she fast
bound Fergus to them in like manner.
