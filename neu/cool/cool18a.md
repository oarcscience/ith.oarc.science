18a. The Misthrow At Belach Eoin.

Then came to them Fiacha Fialdana ('the Generous and Intrepid') of the
Ulstermen to speak with the son of his mother's sister, namely with Manè
Andoè ('the Unslow') of the Connachtmen. And thus he came, and Dubthach
Doel ('the Black Tongue') of Ulster with him. It was in this wise that
Manè Andoè came, and Dochè son of Maga along with him.

When now Dochè macMagach espied Fiacha Fialdana, he straightway hurled a
spear at him, but so that it went through his own friend, through
Dubthach Doel of Ulster. Then Fiacha Fialdana hurled a spear at Dochè
macMagach, so that it went through his own friend, through Manè Andoè of
Connacht. Thereupon said the men of Erin: "A mishap in throwing," they
said, "is what hath happened to the men, for each of them to kill his
friend and nearest relation."

Hence this is entitled Imroll Belaig Eoin ('the Misthrow at Bird-pass').
And 'the Other Misthrow at Bird-pass' is another name for it.
