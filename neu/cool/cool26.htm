<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">26. The Decision of the Battle</P>
</B><P>It was on that night that the Morrigan, daughter of Ernmas, came, and she was engaged in fomenting strife and sowing dissension between the two camps on either side, and she spoke these words: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Ravens shall pick<BR>
The necks of men!<BR>
Blood shall gush<BR>
In combat wild!<BR>
Skins shall be hacked<BR>
Crazed with spoils!<BR>
Men's sides pierced<BR>
In battle brave,<BR>
Luibnech near!<BR>
Warriors' storm;<BR>
Mien of braves;<BR>
Cruachan's men!<BR>
Upon them comes<BR>
Ruin complete!<BR>
Lines shall be strewn<BR>
Under foot;<BR>
Their race die out!<BR>
Then Ulster hail:<BR>
To Erna woe!<BR>
To Ulster woe:<BR>
Then Erna hail!<BR>
(This she said in Erna's ear.)<BR>
Naught inglorious shall they do<BR>
Who them await!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It was then that Cuchulain spake to Laeg son of Riangabair. "It would surely be unworthy of thee, O Laeg my master," said Cuchulain, "if between the two battle-lines there should happen anything to-day whereof thou hadst no tidings for me." "Whatsoever I shall learn, O Cucucuc," answered Laeg, "will be told thee. But, see yonder a little flock coming forth on the plain from the western camp and station now. Behold a band of henchmen after them to check and to stay them. Behold also a company of henchmen emerging from the eastern camp and station to seize them." "Surely, that is so!" exclaimed Cuchulain. " That bodes a mighty combat and is the occasion of a grand battle. The little flock will come over the plain and the bands of henchmen will encounter the little flock on the great field of battle." There, indeed, Cuchulain spoke true. And the little flock came forth upon the plain, and the companies of henchmen met in fray. </P>
<P>"Who gives the battle now, O Laeg my master," Cuchulain asked. "The folk of Ulster," Laeg answered: "that is the same as the young warriors of Ulster." "But how fight they?" Cuchulain asked. "Like men they fight," Laeg answered. "There where are the heroes of valour from the east in battle, they force a breach through the ranks to the west. There where are the heroes from the west, they lay a breach through the ranks to the eastward." </P>
<P>"I grieve that I am not yet strong enough to be on my feet amongst them. For, were I able to be on my feet amongst them, my breach would be manifest there to-day like that of another!" "But, this avow, O Cucuc," said Laeg: "it is no reproach to thy valour; it is no disgrace to thine honour. Thou hast done bravely in time before now and thou wilt do bravely hereafter." </P>
<P>"Come, O my master Laeg!" cried Cuchulain; "rouse the men of Ulster to the battle now, for it is time that they come." Laeg came and roused the men of Ulster to battle, and he uttered these words there: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Arise, ye kings of Macha,<BR>
Valiant in your deeds!<BR>
The Badb doth covet<BR>
Imbel's kine.<BR>
Blood of hearts pours out!<BR>
Goodly heroes' battle rushes in<BR>
With deeds of valour!<BR>
Hearts all red with gore:<BR>
Brows turned in flight.<BR>
Dismay of battle riseth.<BR>
For there was never found<BR>
One like unto Cuchulain,<BR>
Hound that Macha's weal doth work!<BR>
Quickly,<BR>
If it is for Cualnge's kine,<BR>
Let them now arise!</BLOCKQUOTE>
