12f. The Slaughter of The King's Bodyguard

"Let us ask for a sword-truce from Cuchulain," said Ailill and Medb.
Lugaid goes to him and Cuchulain accords the truce. "Put a man for me on
the ford to-morrow," said Cuchulain. There happened to be with Medb six
royal hirelings, to wit: six princes of the Gans of Deda, the three Dubs
('the Blacks') of Imlech, and the three Dergs ('the Reds') of Sruthair,
by name. "Why should it not be for us," quoth they, "to go and attack
Cuchulain?" So the next day they went and Cuchulain put an end to the
six of them.
