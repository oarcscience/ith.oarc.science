23a. The Red-Shame of Menn Followeth Here

It was then came to them great Menn son of Salcholga, he from Renna
('the Waterways') of the Boyne in the north. Twelve men with
many-pointed weapons, that was his number. It was thus they came, and
two spearheads on each shaft with them, a spear-head on the top and a
spearhead at the butt, so that it made no difference whether they
wounded the hosts with the points or with the butts.

They offered three attacks upon the hosts. Three times their own number
fell at their hands and there fell twelve men of the people of Menn. But
Menn himself was sorely wounded in the strait, so that blood ran crimson
on him. Then said the men of Erin: "Red is this shame," said they, "for
Menn son of Salcholga, that his people, should be slain and destroyed
and he himself wounded till blood ran crimson red upon him." Hence here
is the 'Reddening Shame of Menn.'

Then said the men of Erin, it would be no dishonour for Menn son of
Salcholga to leave the camp and quarters, and that the hosts would go a
day's journey back to the north again, and that Menn should cease his
weapon-feats on the hosts till Conchobar arose out of his 'Pains' and
battle would be offered them at Garech and Ilgarech, as the druids and
soothsayers and the knowers of the men of Erin had foretold it.

Menn son of Salcholga agreed to that, to leave the camp and
halting-place. And the hosts fell back a day's march for to rest and
wait, and Menn went his way to his own land.
