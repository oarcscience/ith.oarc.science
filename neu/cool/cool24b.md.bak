24b. The Agitation of Celtchar

It was then that Celtchar in his sleep uttered these words in the midst
of the men of Ulster in Iraird Cuillinn that night:

> "Thirty hundred chariot-men;  
> An hundred horse-companions stout;  
> An hundred with an hundred druids!  
> To lead us will not fail  
> The hero of the land,  
> Conchobar with hosts around him!  
> Let the battle line be formed!  
> Gather now, ye warriors!  
> Battle shall be fought  
> At Garech and Ilgarech  
> On aftermorrow's morn!"

On that same night Cormac Conlongas, Conchobar's son, spake these words
to the men of Erin at Slemain Mide that night:

> "A wonder of a morning,  
> A wondrous I time!  
> When hosts will be confused,  
> Kings turned back in flight!  
> Necks will be broken,  
> The sand made red,  
> When forth breaks the battle, the seven chieftains before,  
> Of Ulster's host round Conchobar!  
> Their women will they defend,  
> For their herds will they fight  
> At Garech and Ilgarech,  
> On the morning after the morrow! "

On that same night, Dubthach Doel ('the Scorpion') of Ulster uttered
these words in his sleep among the men of Erin at Slemain Mide that
night:

> "Great be the morn,  
> The morn of Meath!  
> Great be the truce  
> The truce of Culenn!

> "Great be the fight,  
> The fight Of Clartha!  
> Great, too, the steeds,  
> The steeds of Assal!

> "Great be the plague,  
> The plague of Tuath-Bressi!  
> Great be the storm,  
> Ulster's battle-storm round Conchobar!

> "Their women will they defend,  
> For their herds will they fight  
> At Garech and Ilgarech,  
> On the morning after the morrow!"

Dubthach was awakened from his sleep, so that Nemain brought confusion
on the host and they fell trembling in their arms under the points of
their spears and weapons, so that an hundred warriors of them fell dead
in the midst of their camp and quarters at the fearfulness of the shout
they heard on high. Be that as it would, that night was not the calmest
for the men of Erin that they passed before or since, because of the
forebodings and predictions and because of the spectres and visions that
were revealed to them.
