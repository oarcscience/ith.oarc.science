18\. The Slaying Of Oengus Son Of Oenlam

Then it was that a very bold young warrior of the Ulstermen came nigh
the hosts; his bye-name was Oengus son of Oenlam Gabè ('the One-handed
Smith'). And he drove the hosts before him from Moda Loga, which at that
time was called Lugmud, to Ath da Fert ('the Ford of the Two
Gravemounds') in Sliab Fuait.

What scholars say is: If Oengus son of Oenlam Gabè had fought them in
single combat, two-thirds of the host would have fallen before that by
him in single battle. Howbeit it was by no means so that they acted, but
they attacked him from ambush on every side, till he fell at their hands
in unequal fight at Ath da Fert in Sliab Fuait.
