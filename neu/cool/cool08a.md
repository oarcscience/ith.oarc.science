8a. The Slaying Of The Three Macarach

Then came the three macArach on to the ford at Ard Ciannacht to
encounter Cuchulain: Lon ('Ousel'), Uala ('Pride'), and Diliu
('Deluge');-- Meslir ('Lir's Fosterling'), and Meslaoc ('Hero's
Fosterling'), and Meslethain ('Lethan's Fosterling') were the names of
their charioteers. This is why they came to engage with Cuchulain, for
the deed he had done the day before they deemed past bearing, when the
two sons of Nera son of Nuatar, son of Tacan, were slain at Ath Gabla
('Fork-ford'), and Orlam, Ailill's son and Medb's, was slain withal and
his head displayed to the men of Erin, so that their desire was to kill
Cuchulain in the same manner in revenge for him, and that they should be
the ones to rid the host of that pest and bring his head with them to
set it aloft.

They went into the wood and cut off three great white-hazelwood-strips
(and put them) into the hands of their charioteers, so that the six of
them might engage in battle at one and the same time with Cuchulain.
Cuchulain turned on them and smote their six heads from them. Thus fell
the macArach at the hands of Cuchulain
