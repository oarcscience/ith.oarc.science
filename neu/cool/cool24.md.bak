24\. The Repeated Warning of Sualtaim

Now while the deeds we have told here were being done, Sualtaim ('Goodly
fosterer') son of Becaltach ('of Small belongings') son of Moraltach
('of Great belongings'), the same the father of Cuchulain macSualtaim,
was told of the distress of his son contending in unequal combat on the
Cualnge Cattle-spoil, even against Calatin Dana ('the Bold') with his
seven and twenty sons, and against Glass son of Delga, his grandson.

"Whate'er it be, this that I hear from afar," quoth Sualtaim, "it is the
sky that bursts or the sea that ebbs or the earth that quakes, or is it
the distress of my son overmatched in the strife on the Driving of the
Kine of Cualnge?" In that, indeed, Sualtaim spoke true. And he went to
learn all after a while, without hastening on his way. And when Sualtaim
was come to where his son Cuchulain was, Sualtaim began to moan and
lament for Cuchulain.

Forsooth Cuchulain deemed it neither an honour nor glory that Sualtaim
should bemoan and lament him, for Cuchulain knew that, wounded and
injured though he was, Sualtaim would not be the man to avenge his
wrong. For such was Sualtaim: He was no mean warrior and he was no
mighty warrior, but only a good, worthy man was he. "Come, my father
Sualtaim," said Cuchulain, "do thou go to Emain Macha to the men of
Ulster and tell them to come now to have a care for their droves, for no
longer am I able to protect them in the gaps and passes of the land of
Conalle Murthemni. All alone am I against four of the five grand
provinces of Erin from Monday at Summer's end till the beginning of
Spring, every day slaying a man on a ford and a hundred warriors every
night. Fair fight is not granted me nor single combat, and no one comes
to aid me nor to succour. Spancel-hoops hold my cloak over me. Dry tufts
of grass are stuffed in my wounds. There is not a single hair on my body
from my crown to my sole whereon the point of a needle could stand,
without a drop of deep-red blood on the top of each hair, save the left
hand alone which is holding my shield, and even there thrice fifty
bloody wounds are upon it. And let them straightway give battle to the
warriors, and unless they avenge this anon, they will never avenge it
till the very day of doom and of life!"

Sualtaim set out on Liath ('the Roan') of Macha as his only horse, with
warning to the men of Ulster. And when he was come alongside of Emain,
he shouted these words there: "Men are slain, women stolen, cattle
lifted, ye men of Ulster!" cried Sualtaim.

He had not the answer that served him from the Ulstermen, and forasmuch
as he had it not he went on further to the rampart of Emain. And he
cried out the same words there: "Men are slain, women stolen, cattle
lifted, ye men of Ulster!" cried Sualtaim.

Again he had not the response that served him from the men of Ulster.
Thus stood it among the Ulstermen: It was geis for the Ulstermen to
speak before their king, geis for the king to speak before his druids.
Thereafter Sualtaim drove on to the 'Flag-stone of the hostages' in
Emain Macha. He shouted the same words there: "Men are slain, women
stolen, cows carried off!"

"But who has slain them, and who has stolen them, and who has carried
them off?" asked Cathba the druid. "Ailill and Medb have overwhelmed
you," said Sualtaim. "Your wives and your sons and your children, your
steeds and your stock of horses, your herds and your flocks and your
droves of cattle have been carried away. Cuchulain all alone is checking
and staying the hosts of the four great provinces of Erin at the gaps
and passes of the land of Conalle Murthemni. Fair fight is refused him,
nor is he granted single combat, nor comes any one to succour or aid
him. The youth is wounded, his limbs are out of joint. Spancel-hoops
hold his cloak over him. There is not a hair from his crown to his sole
whereon the point of a needle could stand, without a drop of deep-red
blood on the top of each hair, except his left hand alone which is
holding his shield, and even there thrice fifty bloody wounds are upon
it. And unless ye avenge this betimes, ye will never avenge it till the
end of time and of life."

"Fitter is death and doom and destruction for the man that so incites
the king!" quoth Cathba the druid. "In good sooth, it is true!" said the
Ulstermen all together. Thereupon Sualtaim went his way from them,
indignant and angry because from the men of Ulster he had not had the
answer that served him.

Then reared Liath ('the Roan') of Macha under Sualtaim and dashed on to
the ramparts of Emain. Thereat Sualtaim fell under his own shield, so
that the edge of the shield severed Sualtaim's head. The horse himself
turned back again to Emain, and the shield on the horse and the head on
the shield. And Sualtaim's head uttered the same words: "Men are slain
women stolen, cattle lifted, ye men of Ulster!" spake the head of
Sualtaim.

"Some deal too great is that cry," quoth Conchobar; "for yet is the sky
above us, the earth underneath and the sea round about us. And unless
the heavens shall fall with their showers of stars on the man-like face
of the world, or unless the ground burst open in quakes beneath our
feet, or unless the furrowed, blue-bordered ocean break o'er the tufted
brow of the earth, will I restore to her byre and her stall, to her
abode and her dwelling-place, each and every cow and woman of them with
victory of battle and contest and combat!"

Thereupon a runner of his people was summoned to Conchobar, Findchad
Ferbenduma ('he of the copper Horn') to wit, son of Fraech Lethan ('the
Broad'), and he bade him go assemble and muster the men of Ulster. And
in like manner, Conchobar enumerated to him their quick and their dead,
in the drunkenness of sleep and of his 'Pains,' and he uttered these
words: The Order of the men of Ulster.

> "Arise, O Findchad!  
> I Thee I send forth:  
> A negligence not to be wished (?);  
> Proclaim it to the chiefs of Ulster!
