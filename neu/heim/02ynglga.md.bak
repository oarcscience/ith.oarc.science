    THE YNGLINGA SAGA, OR THE STORY OF THE YNGLING FAMILY FROM ODIN
    TO HALFDAN THE BLACK.



    1. OF THE SITUATION OF COUNTRIES.

    It is said that the earth's circle which the human race inhabits
    is torn across into many bights, so that great seas run into the
    land from the out-ocean. Thus it is known that a great sea goes
    in at Narvesund (1), and up to the land of Jerusalem.  From the
    same sea a long sea-bight stretches towards the north-east, and
    is called the Black Sea, and divides the three parts of the
    earth; of which the eastern part is called Asia, and the western
    is called by some Europa, by some Enea.  Northward of the Black
    Sea lies Swithiod the Great, or the Cold.  The Great Swithiod is
    reckoned by some as not less than the Great Serkland (2); others
    compare it to the Great Blueland (3).  The northern part of
    Swithiod lies uninhabited on account of frost and cold, as
    likewise the southern parts of Blueland are waste from the
    burning of the sun.  In Swithiod are many great domains, and many
    races of men, and many kinds of languages.  There are giants, and
    there are dwarfs, and there are also blue men, and there are any
    kinds of stranger creatures.  There are huge wild beasts, and
    dreadful dragons.  On the south side of the mountains which lie
    outside of all inhabited lands runs a river through Swithiod,
    which is properly called by the name of Tanais, but was formerly
    called Tanaquisl, or Vanaquisl, and which falls into the Black
    Sea.  The country of the people on the Vanaquisl was called
    Vanaland, or Vanaheim; and the river separates the three parts of
    the world, of which the eastermost part is called Asia, and the
    westermost Europe.

    2. OF THE PEOPLE OF ASIA.

    The country east of the Tanaquisl in Asia was called Asaland, or
    Asaheim, and the chief city in that land was called Asgaard.  In
    that city was a chief called Odin, and it was a great place for
    sacrifice.  It was the custom there that twelve temple priests
    should both direct the sacrifices, and also judge the people.
    They were called Diar, or Drotner, and all the people served and
    obeyed them.  Odin was a great and very far-travelled warrior,
    who conquered many kingdoms, and so successful was he that in
    every battle the victory was on his side.  It was the belief of
    his people that victory belonged to him in every battle.  It was
    his custom when he sent his men into battle, or on any
    expedition, that he first laid his hand upon their heads, and
    called down a blessing upon them; and then they believed their
    undertaking would be successful.  His people also were
    accustomed, whenever they fell into danger by land or sea, to
    call upon his name; and they thought that always they got comfort
    and aid by it, for where he was they thought help was near. 
    Often he went away so far that he passed many seasons on his
    journeys.



    3. OF ODIN'S BROTHERS.

    Odin had two brothers, the one called Ve, the other Vilje, and
    they governed the kingdom when he was absent.  It happened once
    when Odin had gone to a great distance, and had been so long away
    that the people Of Asia doubted if he would ever return home,
    that his two brothers took it upon themselves to divide his
    estate; but both of them took his wife Frigg to themselves.  Odin
    soon after returned home, and took his wife back.



    4. OF ODIN'S WAR WITH THE PEOPLE OF VANALAND.

    Odin went out with a great army against the Vanaland people; but
    they were well prepared, and defended their land; so that victory
    was changeable, and they ravaged the lands of each other, and did
    great damage.  They tired of this at last, and on both sides
    appointed a meeting for establishing peace, made a truce, and
    exchanged hostages.  The Vanaland people sent their best men,
    Njord the Rich, and his son Frey.  The people of Asaland sent a
    man called Hone, whom they thought well suited to be a chief, as
    he was a stout and very handsome man; and with him they sent a
    man of great understanding called Mime.  On the other side, the
    Vanaland people sent the wisest man in their community, who was
    called Kvase.  Now, when Hone came to Vanaheim he was immediately
    made a chief, and Mime came to him with good counsel on all
    occasions.  But when Hone stood in the Things or other meetings,
    if Mime was not near him, and any difficult matter was laid
    before him, he always answered in one way -- "Now let others give
    their advice"; so that the Vanaland people got a suspicion that
    the Asaland people had deceived them in the exchange of men. They
    took Mime, therefore, and beheaded him, and sent his head to the
    Asaland people.  Odin took the head, smeared it with herbs so
    that it should not rot, and sang incantations over it.  Thereby
    he gave it the power that it spoke to him, and discovered to him
    many secrets.  Odin placed Njord and Frey as priests of the
    sacrifices, and they became Diar of the Asaland people.  Njord's
    daughter Freya was priestess of the sacrifices, and first taught
    the Asaland people the magic art, as it was in use and fashion
    among the Vanaland people.  While Njord was with the Vanaland
    people he had taken his own sister in marriage, for that was
    allowed by their law; and their children were Frey and Freya. 
    But among the Asaland people it was forbidden to intermarry with
    such near relations.



    5. ODIN DIVIDES HIS KINGDOM: ALSO CONCERNING GEFION.

    There goes a great mountain barrier from north-east to south-
    west, which divides the Greater Swithiod from other kingdoms.
    South of this mountain ridge it is not far to Turkland, where
    Odin had great possessions.  In those times the Roman chiefs went
    wide around in the world, subduing to themselves all people; and
    on this account many chiefs fled from their domains.  But Odin
    having foreknowledge, and magic-sight, knew that his posterity
    would come to settle and dwell in the northern half of the world.
    He therefore set his brothers Ve and Vilje over Asgaard; and he
    himself, with all the gods and a great many other people,
    wandered out, first westward to Gardarike, and then south to
    Saxland.  He had many sons; and after having subdued an extensive
    kingdom in Saxland, he set his sons to rule the country.  He
    himself went northwards to the sea, and took up his abode in an
    island which is called Odins in Fyen.  Then he sent Gefion across
    the sound to the north to discover new countries; and she came to
    King Gylve, who gave her a ploughgate of land.  Then she went to
    Jotunheim, and bore four sons to a giant, and transformed them
    into a yoke of oxen.  She yoked them to a plough, and broke out
    the land into the ocean right opposite to Odins.  This land was
    called Sealand, and there she afterwards settled and dwelt.
    Skjold, a son of Odin, married her, and they dwelt at Leidre.
    Where the ploughed land was is a lake or sea called Laage.  In
    the Swedish land the fjords of Laage correspond to the nesses in
    Sealand.  Brage the Old sings thus of it: --

         "Gefion from Gylve drove away,
         To add new land to Denmark's sway --
         Blythe Gefion ploughing in the smoke
         That steamed up from her oxen-yoke:
         Four heads, eight forehead stars had they,
         Bright gleaming, as she ploughed away;
         Dragging new lands from the deep main
         To join them to the sweet isle's plain.

    Now when Odin heard that things were in a prosperous condition in
    the land to the east beside Gylve; he went thither, and Gylve
    made a peace with him, for Gylve thought he had no strength to
    oppose the people of Asaland.  Odin and Gylve had many tricks and
    enchantments against each other; but the Asaland people had
    always the superiority.  Odin took up his residence at the
    Maelare lake, at the place now called Old Sigtun.  There he
    erected a large temple, where there were sacrifices according to
    the customs of the Asaland people.  He appropriated to himself
    the whole of that district, and called it Sigtun.  To the temple
    priests he gave also domains.  Njord dwelt in Noatun, Frey in
    Upsal, Heimdal in the Himinbergs, Thor in Thrudvang, Balder in
    Breidablik; to all of them he gave good estates.



    6. OF ODIN'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

    When Odin of Asaland came to the north, and the Diar with him,
    they introduced and taught to others the arts which the people
    long afterwards have practised.  Odin was the cleverest of all,
    and from him all the others learned their arts and
    accomplishments; and he knew them first, and knew many more than
    other people.  But now, to tell why he is held in such high
    respect, we must mention various causes that contributed to it.
    When sitting among his friends his countenance was so beautiful
    and dignified, that the spirits of all were exhilarated by it,
    but when he was in war he appeared dreadful to his foes.  This
    arose from his being able to change his skin and form in any way
    he liked.  Another cause was, that he conversed so cleverly and
    smoothly, that all who heard believed him.  He spoke everything
    in rhyme, such as now composed, which we call scald-craft.  He
    and his temple priests were called song-smiths, for from them
    came that art of song into the northern countries.  Odin could
    make his enemies in battle blind, or deaf, or terror-struck, and
    their weapons so blunt that they could no more but than a willow
    wand; on the other hand, his men rushed forwards without armour,
    were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were strong
    as bears or wild bulls, and killed people at a blow, but neither
    fire nor iron told upon themselves.  These were called Berserker.



    7. OF ODIN'S FEATS.

    Odin could transform his shape: his body would lie as if dead, or
    asleep; but then he would be in shape of a fish, or worm, or
    bird, or beast, and be off in a twinkling to distant lands upon
    his own or other people's business.  With words alone he could
    quench fire, still the ocean in tempest, and turn the wind to any
    quarter he pleased.  Odin had a ship which was called
    Skidbladnir, in which he sailed over wide seas, and which he
    could roll up like a cloth.  Odin carried with him Mime's head,
    which told him all the news of other countries.  Sometimes even
    he called the dead out of the earth, or set himself beside the
    burial-mounds; whence he was called the ghost-sovereign, and lord
    of the mounds.  He had two ravens, to whom he had taught the
    speech of man; and they flew far and wide through the land, and
    brought him the news.  In all such things he was pre-eminently
    wise.  He taught all these arts in Runes, and songs which are
    called incantations, and therefore the Asaland people are called
    incantation-smiths.  Odin understood also the art in which the
    greatest power is lodged, and which he himself practised; namely,
    what is called magic.  By means of this he could know beforehand
    the predestined fate of men, or their not yet completed lot; and
    also bring on the death, ill-luck, or bad health of people, and
    take the strength or wit from one person and give it to another.
    But after such witchcraft followed such weakness and anxiety,
    that it was not thought respectable for men to practise it; and
    therefore the priestesses were brought up in this art.  Odin knew
    finely where all missing cattle were concealed under the earth,
    and understood the songs by which the earth, the hills, the
    stones, and mounds were opened to him; and he bound those who
    dwell in them by the power of his word, and went in and took what
    he pleased.  From these arts he became very celebrated.  His
    enemies dreaded him; his friends put their trust in him, and
    relied on his power and on himself.  He taught the most of his
    arts to his priests of the sacrifices, and they came nearest to
    himself in all wisdom and witch-knowledge.  Many others, however,
    occupied themselves much with it; and from that time witchcraft
    spread far and wide, and continued long.  People sacrificed to
    Odin and the twelve chiefs from Asaland, and called them their
    gods, and believed in them long after.  From Odin's name came the
    name Audun, which people gave to his sons; and from Thor's name
    comes Thore, also Thorarinn; and also it is sometimes compounded
    with other names, as Steenthor, or Havthor, or even altered in
    other ways.



    8. ODIN'S LAWGIVING.

    Odin established the same law in his land that had been in force
    in Asaland.  Thus he established by law that all dead men should
    be burned, and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and
    the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth.  Thus,
    said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had
    with him upon the pile; and he would also enjoy whatever he
    himself had buried in the earth.  For men of consequence a mound
    should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who
    had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom
    remained long after Odin's time.  On winter day there should be
    blood-sacrifice for a good year, and in the middle of winter for
    a good crop; and the third sacrifice should be on summer day, for
    victory in battle.  Over all Swithiod the people paid Odin a
    scatt or tax -- so much on each head; but he had to defend the
    country from enemy or disturbance, and pay the expense of the
    sacrifice feasts for a good year.



    9. OF NJORD'S MARRIAGE.

    Njord took a wife called Skade; but she would not live with him
    and married afterwards Odin, and had many sons by him, of whom
    one was called Saeming; and about him Eyvind Skaldaspiller sings
    thus: --

         "To Asa's son Queen Skade bore
         Saeming, who dyed his shield in gore, --
         The giant-queen of rock and snow,
         Who loves to dwell on earth below,
         The iron pine-tree's daughter, she
         Sprung from the rocks that rib the sea,
         To Odin bore full many a son,
         Heroes of many a battle won."

    To Saeming Earl Hakon the Great reckoned back his pedigree.  This
    Swithiod they called Mannheim, but the Great Swithiod they called
    Godheim; and of Godheim great wonders and novelties were related.



    10. OF ODIN'S DEATH.

    Odin died in his bed in Swithiod; and when he was near his death
    he made himself be marked with the point of a spear, and said he
    was going to Godheim, and would give a welcome there to all his
    friends, and all brave warriors should be dedicated to him; and
    the Swedes believed that he was gone to the ancient Asgaard, and
    would live there eternally.  Then began the belief in Odin, and
    the calling upon him.  The Swedes believed that he often showed
    to them before any great battle.  To some he gave victory; others
    he invited to himself; and they reckoned both of these to be
    fortunate.  Odin was burnt, and at his pile there was great
    splendour.  It was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in
    the air, the higher he would be raised whose pile it was; and the
    richer he would be, the more property that was consumed with him. 


    11. OF NJORD.

    Njord of Noatun was then the sole sovereign of the Swedes; and he
    continued the sacrifices, and was called the drot or sovereign by
    the Swedes, and he received scatt and gifts from them.  In his
    days were peace and plenty, and such good years, in all respects,
    that the Swedes believed Njord ruled over the growth of seasons
    and the prosperity of the people.  In his time all the diar or
    gods died, and blood-sacrifices were made for them.  Njord died
    on a bed of sickness, and before he died made himself be marked
    for Odin with the spear-point.  The Swedes burned him, and all
    wept over his grave-mound.



    11. FREY'S DEATH.

    Frey took the kingdom after Njord, and was called drot by the
    Swedes, and they paid taxes to him.  He was, like his father,
    fortunate in friends and in good seasons.  Frey built a great
    temple at Upsal, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his
    taxes, his land, and goods.  Then began the Upsal domains, which
    have remained ever since.  Then began in his days the Frode-
    peace; and then there were good seasons, in all the land, which
    the Swedes ascribed to Frey, so that he was more worshipped than
    the other gods, as the people became much richer in his days by
    reason of the peace and good seasons.  His wife was called Gerd,
    daughter of Gymis, and their son was called Fjolne.  Frey was
    called by another name, Yngve; and this name Yngve was considered
    long after in his race as a name of honour, so that his
    descendants have since been called Ynglinger.  Frey fell into a
    sickness; and as his illness took the upper hand, his men took
    the plan of letting few approach him.  In the meantime they
    raised a great mound, in which they placed a door with three
    holes in it.  Now when Frey died they bore him secretly into the
    mound, but told the Swedes he was alive; and they kept watch over
    him for three years.  They brought all the taxes into the mound,
    and through the one hole they put in the gold, through the other
    the silver, and through the third the copper money that was paid.
    Peace and good seasons continued.



    13. OF FREYA AND HER DAUGHTERS.

    Freya alone remained of the gods, and she became on this account
    so celebrated that all women of distinction were called by her
    name, whence they now have the title Frue; so that every woman is
    called frue, or mistress over her property, and the wife is
    called the house-frue.  Freya continued the blood-sacrifices.
    Freya had also many other names.  Her husband was called Oder,
    and her daughters Hnoss and Gerseme.  They were so very
    beautiful, that afterwards the most precious jewels were called
    by their names.

    When it became known to the Swedes that Frey was dead, and yet
    peace and good seasons continued, they believed that it must be
    so as long as Frey remained in Sweden; and therefore they would
    not burn his remains, but called him the god of this world, and
    afterwards offered continually blood-sacrifices to him,
    principally for peace and good seasons.



    14. OF KING FJOLNE'S DEATH.

    Fjolne, Yngve Frey's son, ruled thereafter over the Swedes and
    the Upsal domains.  He was powerful, and lucky in seasons and in
    holding the peace.  Fredfrode ruled then in Leidre, and between
    them there was great friendship and visiting.  Once when Fjolne
    went to Frode in Sealand, a great feast was prepared for him, and
    invitations to it were sent all over the country.  Frode had a
    large house, in which there was a great vessel many ells high,
    and put together of great pieces of timber; and this vessel stood
    in a lower room.  Above it was a loft, in the floor of which was
    an opening through which liquor was poured into this vessel.  The
    vessel was full of mead, which was excessively strong.  In the
    evening Fjolne, with his attendants, was taken into the adjoining
    loft to sleep.  In the night he went out to the gallery to seek a
    certain place, and he was very sleepy and exceedingly drunk.  As
    he came back to his room he went along the gallery to the door of
    another left, went into it, and his foot slipping, he fell into
    the vessel of mead and was drowned.  So says Thjodolf of Kvine:
    --

         "In Frode's hall the fearful word,
         The death-foreboding sound was heard:
         The cry of fey denouncing doom,
         Was heard at night in Frode's home.
         And when brave Frode came, he found
         Swithiod's dark chief, Fjolne, drowned.
         In Frode's mansion drowned was he,
         Drowned in a waveless, windless sea."



    15. OF SWEGDE.

    Swegde took the kingdom after his father, and he made a solemn
    vow to seek Godheim and Odin.  He went with twelve men through
    the world, and came to Turkland, and the Great Svithiod, where he
    found many of his connections.  He was five years on this
    journey; and when he returned home to Sweden he remained there
    for some time.  He had got a wife in Vanheim, who was called
    Vana, and their son was Vanlande.  Swegde went out afterwards to
    seek again for Godheim, and came to a mansion on the east side of
    Swithiod called Stein, where there was a stone as big as a large
    house.  In the evening after sunset, as Swegde was going from the
    drinking-table to his sleeping-room, he cast his eye upon the
    stone, and saw that a dwarf was sitting under it.  Swegde and his
    man were very drunk, and they ran towards the stone.  The dwarf
    stood in the door, and called to Swegde, and told him to come in,
    and he should see Odin.  Swegde ran into the stone, which
    instantly closed behind him, and Swegde never came back. 
    Thiodolf of Kvine tells of this: --

         "By Diurnir's elfin race,
         Who haunt the cliffs and shun day's face,
         The valiant Swegde was deceived,
         The elf's false words the king believed.
         The dauntless hero rushing on,
         Passed through the yawning mouth of stone:
         It yawned -- it shut -- the hero fell,
         In Saekmime's hall, where giants dwell."



    16. OF VANLANDE, SWEGDE'S SON.

    Vanlande, Swegde's son, succeeded his father, and ruled over the
    Upsal domain.  He was a great warrior, and went far around in
    different lands.  Once he took up his winter abode in Finland
    with Snae the Old, and got his daughter Driva in marriage; but in
    spring he set out leaving Driva behind, and although he had
    promised to return within three years he did not come back for
    ten.  Then Driva sent a message to the witch Huld; and sent
    Visbur, her son by Vanlande, to Sweden.  Driva bribed the witch-
    wife Huld, either that she should bewitch Vanlande to return to
    Finland, or kill him.  When this witch-work was going on Vanlande
    was at Upsal, and a great desire came over him to go to Finland;
    but his friends and counsellors advised him against it, and said
    the witchcraft of the Finn people showed itself in this desire of
    his to go there.  He then became very drowsy, and laid himself
    down to sleep; but when he had slept but a little while he cried
    out, saying that the Mara was treading upon him.  His men
    hastened to him to help him; but when they took hold of his head
    she trod on his legs, and when they laid hold of his legs she
    pressed upon his head; and it was his death.  The Swedes took his
    body and burnt it at a river called Skytaa, where a standing
    stone was raised over him.  Thus says Thjodolf: --

         "And Vanlande, in a fatal hour,
         Was dragg'd by Grimhild's daughter's power,
         The witch-wife's, to the dwelling-place
         Where men meet Odin face to face.
         Trampled to death, to Skytaa's shore
         The corpse his faithful followers bore;
         And there they burnt, with heavy hearts,
         The good chief killed by witchcraft's arts.



    17. OF VISBUR, VANLANDE'S SON.

    Visbur succeeded his father Vanlande.  He married the daughter of
    Aude the Rich, and gave her as her bride-gift three large farms,
    and a gold ornament.  They had two sons, Gisle and Ond; but
    Visbur left her and took another wife, whereupon she went home to
    her father with her two sons.  Visbur had a son who was called
    Domald, and his stepmother used witchcraft to give him ill-luck.
    Now, when Visbur's sons were the one twelve and the other
    thirteen years of age, they went to their father's place, and
    desired to have their mother's dower; but he would not deliver it
    to them.  Then they said that the gold ornament should be the
    death of the best man in all his race, and they returned home. 
    Then they began again with enchantments and witchcraft, to try if
    they could destroy their father.  The sorceress Huld said that by
    witchcraft she could bring it about by this means, that a
    murderer of his own kin should never be wanting in the Yngling
    race; and they agreed to have it so.  Thereafter they collected
    men, came unexpectedly in the night on Visbur, and burned him in
    his house.  So sings Thjodolf: --

         "Have the fire-dogs' fierce tongues yelling
         Lapt Visbur's blood on his own hearth?
         Have the flames consumed the dwelling
         Of the here's soul on earth?
         Madly ye acted, who set free
         The forest foe, red fire, night thief,
         Fell brother of the raging sea,
         Against your father and your chief."



    18. OF DOMALD, VISBUR'S SON.

    Domald took the heritage after his father Visbur, and ruled over
    the land.  As in his time there was great famine and distress,
    the Swedes made great offerings of sacrifice at Upsal.  The first
    autumn they sacrificed oxen, but the succeeding season was not
    improved thereby.  The following autumn they sacrificed men, but
    the succeeding year was rather worse.  The third autumn, when the
    offer of sacrifices should begin, a great multitude of Swedes
    came to Upsal; and now the chiefs held consultations with each
    other, and all agreed that the times of scarcity were on account
    of their king Domald, and they resolved to offer him for good
    seasons, and to assault and kill him, and sprinkle the stalle of
    the gods with his blood.  And they did so.  Thjodolf tells of
    this: --

         "It has happened oft ere now,
         That foeman's weapon has laid low
         The crowned head, where battle plain,
         Was miry red with the blood-rain.
         But Domald dies by bloody arms,
         Raised not by foes in war's alarms --
         Raised by his Swedish liegemen's hand,
         To bring good seasons to the land."



    19. OF DOMAR, DOMALD'S SON.

    Domald's son, called Domar, next ruled over the land.  He reigned
    long, and in his days were good seasons and peace.  Nothing is
    told of him but that he died in his bed in Upsal, and was
    transported to the Fyrisvold, where his body was burned on the
    river bank, and where his standing stone still remains.  So says
    Thjodolf: --

         "I have asked wise men to tell
         Where Domar rests, and they knew well.
         Domar, on Fyrie's wide-spread ground,
         Was burned, and laid on Yngve's mound."



    20. OF DYGVE, DOMAR'S SON.

    Dygve was the name of his son, who succeeded him in ruling the
    land; and about him nothing is said but that he died in his bed.
    Thjodolf tells of it thus: --

         "Dygve the Brave, the mighty king,
         It is no hidden secret thing,
         Has gone to meet a royal mate,
         Riding upon the horse of Fate.
         For Loke's daughter in her house
         Of Yngve's race would have a spouse;
         Therefore the fell-one snatched away
         Brave Dygve from the light of day."

    Dygve's mother was Drott, a daughter of King Danp, the son of
    Rig, who was first called "king" in the Danish tongue.  His
    descendants always afterwards considered the title of king the
    title of highest dignity.  Dygve was the first of his family to
    be called king, for his predecessors had been called "Drottnar",
    and their wives "Drottningar", and their court "Drott".  Each of
    their race was called Yngve, or Yngune, and the whole race
    together Ynglinger.  The Queen Drott was a sister of King Dan
    Mikillati, from whom Denmark a took its name.



    21. OF DAG THE WISE.

    King Dygve's son, called Dag, succeeded to him, and was so wise a
    man that he understood the language of birds.  He had a sparrow
    which told him much news, and flew to different countries.  Once
    the sparrow flew to Reidgotaland, to a farm called Varva, where
    he flew into the peasant's corn-field and took his grain.  The
    peasant came up, took a stone, and killed the sparrow.  King Dag
    was ill-pleased that the sparrow did not come home; and as he, in
    a sacrifice of expiation, inquired after the sparrow, he got the
    answer that it was killed at Varva.  Thereupon he ordered a great
    army, and went to Gotland; and when he came to Varva he landed
    with his men and plundered, and the people fled away before him.
    King Dag returned in the evening to his ships, after having
    killed many people and taken many prisoners.  As they were going
    across a river at a place called Skjotan's [the Weapon's] Ford, a
    labouring thrall came running to the river-side, and threw a hay-
    fork into their troop.  It struck the king on the head, so that
    he fell instantly from his horse and died.  In those times the
    chief who ravaged a country was called Gram, and the men-at-arms
    under him Gramer.  Thjodolf sings of it thus: --

         "What news is this that the king's men,
         Flying eastward through the glen,
         Report?  That Dag the Brave, whose name
         Is sounded far and wide by Fame --
         That Dag, who knew so well to wield
         The battle-axe in bloody field,
         Where brave men meet, no more will head
         The brave -- that mighty Dag is dead!

         "Varva was wasted with the sword,
         And vengeance taken for the bird --
         The little bird that used to bring
         News to the ear of the great king.
         Varva was ravaged, and the strife
         Was ended, when the monarch's life
         Was ended too -- the great Dag fell
         By the hay-fork of a base thrall!"



    22. OF AGNE, DAG'S SON.

    Agne was the name of Dag's son, who was king after him -- a
    powerful and celebrated man, expert, and exercised in all feats.
    It happened one summer that King Agne went with his army to
    Finland, and landed and marauded.  The Finland people gathered a
    large army, and proceeded to the strife under a chief called
    Froste.  There was a great battle, in which King Agne gained the
    victory, and Froste fell there with a great many of his people.
    King Agne proceeded with armed hand through Finland, subdued it,
    and made enormous booty.  He took Froste's daughter Skjalv, and
    her brother Loge, and carried them along with him.  When he
    sailed from the east he came to land at Stoksund, and put up his
    tent on the flat side of the river, where then there was a wood.
    King Agne had at the time the gold ornament which had belonged to
    Visbur.  He now married Skjalv, and she begged him to make burial
    feast in honour of her father.  He invited a great many guests,
    and made a great feast.  He had become very celebrated by his
    expedition, and there was a great drinking match.  Now when King
    Agne had got drank, Skjalv bade him take care of his gold
    ornament which he had about his neck; therefore he took hold of
    the ornament, and bound it fast about his neck before he went to
    sleep.  The land-tent stood at the wood side, and a high tree
    over the tent protected it against the heat of the sun.  Now when
    King Agne was asleep, Skjalv took a noose, and fastened it under
    the ornament.  Thereupon her men threw down the tent-poles, cast
    the loop of the noose up in the branches of the tree, and hauled
    upon it, so that the king was hanged close under the branches and
    died; and Skjalv with her men ran down to their ships, and rowed
    away.  King Agne was buried upon the spot, which was afterwards
    called Agnefet; and it lies on the east side of the Tauren, and
    west of Stoksund.  Thjodolf speaks of it thus: --

         "How do ye like the high-souled maid,
         Who, with the grim Fate-goddess' aid,
         Avenged her sire? -- made Swithiod's king
         Through air in golden halter swing?
         How do ye like her, Agne's men?
         Think ye that any chief again
         Will court the fate your chief befell,
         To ride on wooden horse to hell?"



    23. OF ALRIC AND ERIC.

    The sons of Agne were called Alric and Eric, and were kings
    together after him.  They were powerful men, great warriors, and
    expert at all feats of arms.  It was their custom to ride and
    break in horses both to walk and to gallop, which nobody
    understood so well as they; and they vied with each other who
    could ride best, and keep the best horses.  It happened one day
    that both the brothers rode out together alone, and at a distance
    from their followers, with their best horses, and rode on to a
    field; but never came back.  The people at last went out to look
    after them, and they were both found dead with their heads
    crushed.  As they had no weapons, except it might be their
    horses' bridles, people believed that they had killed each other
    with these.  So says Thjodolf: --

         "Alric fell, by Eric slain,
         Eric's life-blood dyed the plain,
         Brother fell by brother's hand;
         And they tell it in the land,
         That they worked the wicked deed
         With the sharp bits that guide the steed.
         Shall it be said of Frey's brave sons,
         The kingly race, the noble ones,
         That they have fought in deadly battle
         With the head-gear of their cattle?"



    24. OF YNGVE AND ALF.

    Alric's sons, Yngve and Ali, then succeeded to the kingly power
    in Sweden.  Yngve was a great warrior, always victorious;
    handsome, expert in all exercises, strong and very sharp in
    battle, generous and full of mirth; so that he was both renowned
    and beloved.  Alf was a silent, harsh, unfriendly man, and sat at
    home in the land, and never went out on war expeditions.  His
    mother was called Dageid, a daughter of King Dag the Great, from
    whom the Dagling family is descended.  King Alf had a wife named
    Bera, who was the most agreeable of women, very brisk and gay.
    One autumn Yngve, Alric's son, had arrived at Upsal from a viking
    cruise by which he was become very celebrated.  He often sat long
    in the evening at the drinking-table; but Alf went willingly to
    bed very early.  Queen Bera sat often till late in the evening,
    and she and Yngve conversed together for their amusement; but Alf
    soon told her that she should not sit up so late in the evening,
    but should go first to bed, so as not to waken him.  She replied,
    that happy would be the woman who had Yngve instead of Alf for
    her husband; and as she often repeated the same, he became very
    angry.  One evening Alf went into the hall, where Yngve and Bera
    sat on the high seat speaking to each other.  Yngve had a short
    sword upon his knees, and the guests were so drunk that they did
    not observe the king coming in.  King Alf went straight to the
    high seat, drew a sword from under his cloak, and pierced his
    brother Yngve through and through.  Yngve leaped up, drew his
    short sword, and gave Alf his death-wound; so that both fell dead
    on the floor.  Alf and Yngve were buried under mounds in
    Fyrisvold.  Thus tells Thjodolf of it: --

         "I tell you of a horrid thing,
         A deed of dreadful note I sing --
         How by false Bera, wicked queen,
         The murderous brother-hands were seen
         Each raised against a brother's life;
         How wretched Alf with bloody knife
         Gored Yngve's heart, and Yngve's blade
         Alf on the bloody threshold laid.
         Can men resist Fate's iron laws?
         They slew each other without cause."



    25. OF HUGLEIK.

    Hugleik was the name of King Alf's son, who succeeded the two
    brothers in the kingdom of the Swedes, the sons of Yngve being
    still children.  King Hugleik was no warrior, but sat quietly at
    home in his country.  He was very rich, but had still more the
    reputation of being very greedy.  He had at his court all sorts
    of players, who played on harps, fiddles, and viols; and had with
    him magicians, and all sorts of witches.  Hake and Hagbard were
    two brothers, very celebrated as sea-kings, who had a great force
    of men-at-arms.  Sometimes they cruised in company, sometimes
    each for himself, and many warriors followed them both.  King
    Hake came with his troops to Sweden against King Hugleik, who, on
    his side, collected a great army to oppose him.  Two brothers
    came to his assistance, Svipdag and Geigad, both very celebrated
    men, and powerful combatants.  King Hake had about him twelve
    champions, and among them Starkad the Old; and King Hake himself
    was a murderous combatant.  They met on Fyrisvold, and there was
    a great battle, in which King Hugleik's army was soon defeated.
    Then the combatants, Svipdag and Geigad, pressed forward
    manfully; but Hake's champions went six against one, and they
    were both taken prisoners.  Then King Hake penetrated within the
    shield-circle around King Hugleik, and killed him and two of his
    sons within it.  After this the Swedes fled; and King Hake
    subdued the country, and became king of Sweden.  He then sat
    quietly at home for three years, but during that time his
    combatants went abroad on viking expeditions, and gathered
    property for themselves.



    26. KING GUDLOG'S DEATH.

    Jorund and Eric, the sons of Yngve Alricsson, lay all this time
    in their warships, and were great warriors.  One summer they
    marauded in Denmark, where they met a King Gudlog from
    Halogaland, and had a battle with him, which ended in their
    clearing Gudlog's ship and taking him prisoner.  They carried him
    to the land at Stromones, and hanged him there, and afterwards
    his men raised a mound over him.  So says Eyvind Skaldaspiller: 
    --

         "By the fierce East-kings' cruel pride,
         Gudlog must on the wild horse ride --
         The wildest horse you e'er did see:
         'Tis Sigur's steed -- the gallows tree.
         At Stromones the tree did grow,
         Where Gudlog's corpse waves on the bough.
         A high stone stands on Stromo's heath,
         To tell the gallant hero's death."



    27. OF KING HAKE.

    The brothers Eric and Jorund became more celebrated by this deed,
    and appeared to be much greater men than before.  When they heard
    that King Hake in Sweden had sent from him his champions, they
    steered towards Sweden, and gathered together a strong force.  As
    soon as the Swedes heard that the Yngling brothers were come to
    them, they flocked to them in multitudes.  The brothers proceeded
    up the Maelare lake, and advanced towards Upsal against King
    Hake, who came out against them on the Fyrisvoid with far fewer
    people.  There was a great battle, in which King Hake went
    forward so bravely that he killed all who were nearest to him,
    and at last killed King Eric, and cut down the banner of the two
    brothers.  King Jorund with all his men fled to their ships. 
    King Hake had been so grievously wounded that he saw his days
    could not be long; so he ordered a warship which he had to be
    loaded with his dead men and their weapons, and to be taken out
    to the sea; the tiller to be shipped, and the sails hoisted. 
    Then he set fire to some tar-wood, and ordered a pile to be made
    over it in the ship.  Hake was almost if not quite dead, when he
    was laid upon this pile of his.  The wind was blowing off the
    land -- the ship flew, burning in clear flame, out between the
    islets, and into the ocean.  Great was the fame of this deed in
    after times.



    28. JORUND, YNGVE'S SON.

    Jorund, King Yngve's son, remained king at Upsal.  He ruled the
    country; but was often in summer out on war expeditions.  One
    summer he went with his forces to Denmark; and having plundered
    all around in Jutland, he went into Lymfjord in autumn, and
    marauded there also.  While he was thus lying in Oddesund with
    his people, King Gylog of Halogaland, a son of King Gudlog, of
    whom mention is made before, came up with a great force, and gave
    battle to Jorund.  When the country people saw this they swarmed
    from all parts towards the battle, in great ships and small; and
    Jorund was overpowered by the multitude, and his ships cleared of
    their men.  He sprang overboard, but was made prisoner and
    carried to the land. Gylog ordered a gallows to be erected, led
    Jorund to it, and had him hanged there.  So ended his life.
    Thjodolf talks of this event thus: --

         "Jorund has travelled far and wide,
         But the same horse he must bestride
         On which he made brave Gudlog ride.
         He too must for a necklace wear
         Hagbert's fell noose in middle air.
         The army leader thus must ride
         On Horva's horse, at Lymfjord's side."



    29. OF KING ON, JORUND'S SON.

    On or Ane was the name of Jorund's son, who became king of the
    Swedes after his father.  He was a wise man, who made great
    sacrifices to the gods; but being no warrior, he lived quietly at
    home.  In the time when the kings we have been speaking of were
    in Upsal, Denmark had been ruled over by Dan Mikellati, who lived
    to a very great age; then by his son, Frode Mikellati, or the
    Peace-loving, who was succeeded by his sons Halfdan and Fridleif,
    who were great warriors.  Halfdan was older than his brother, and
    above him in all things.  He went with his army against King On
    to Sweden, and was always victorious.  At last King On fled to
    Wester Gotland when he had been king in Upsal about twenty-five
    years, and was in Gotland twenty-five years, while Halfdan
    remained king in Upsal.  King Halfdan died in his bed at Upsal,
    and was buried there in a mound; and King On returned to Upsal
    when he was sixty years of age.  He made a great sacrifice, and
    in it offered up his son to Odin.  On got an answer from Odin,
    that he should live sixty years longer; and he was afterwards
    king in Upsal for twenty-five years.  Now came Ole the Bold, a
    son of King Fridleif, with his army to Sweden, against King On,
    and they had several battles with each other; but Ole was always
    the victor.  Then On fled a second time to Gotland; and for
    twenty-five years Ole reigned in Upsal, until he was killed by
    Starkad the Old.  After Ole's fall, On returned to Upsal, and
    ruled the kingdom for twenty-five years.  Then he made a great
    sacrifice again for long life, in which he sacrificed his second
    son, and received the answer from Odin, that he should live as
    long as he gave him one of his sons every tenth year, and also
    that he should name one of the districts of his country after the
    number of sons he should offer to Odin.  When he had sacrificed
    the seventh of his sons he continued to live; but so that he
    could not walk, but was carried on a chair.  Then he sacrificed
    his eighth son, and lived thereafter ten years, lying in his bed.
    Now he sacrificed his ninth son, and lived ten years more; but so
    that he drank out of a horn like a weaned infant.  He had now
    only one son remaining, whom he also wanted to sacrifice, and to
    give Odin Upsal and the domains thereunto belonging, under the
    name of the Ten Lands, but the Swedes would not allow it; so
    there was no sacrifice, and King On died, and was buried in a
    mound at Upsal.  Since that time it is called On's sickness when
    a man dies, without pain, of extreme old age. Thjodolf tell of
    this: --

         "In Upsal's town the cruel king
         Slaughtered his sons at Odin's shrine --
         Slaughtered his sons with cruel knife,
         To get from Odin length of life.
         He lived until he had to turn
         His toothless mouth to the deer's horn;
         And he who shed his children's blood
         Sucked through the ox's horn his food.
         At length fell Death has tracked him down,
         Slowly, but sure, in Upsal's town."



    30. OF EGIL AND TUNNE.

    Egil was the name of On the Old's son, who succeeded as king in
    Sweden after his father's death.  He was no warrior, but sat
    quietly at home.  Tunne was the name of a slave who had been the
    counsellor and treasurer of On the Old; and when On died Tunne
    took much treasure and buried it in the earth.  Now when Egil
    became king he put Tunne among the other slaves, which he took
    very ill and ran away with others of the slaves.  They dug up the
    treasures which Tunne had concealed, and he gave them to his men,
    and was made their chief.  Afterwards many malefactors flocked to
    him; and they lay out in the woods, but sometimes fell upon the
    domains, pillaging and killing the people.  When King Egil heard
    this he went out with his forces to pursue them; but one night
    when he had taken up his night quarters, Tunne came there with
    his men, fell on the king's men unexpectedly, and killed many of
    them.  As soon as King Egil perceived the tumult, he prepared for
    defence, and set up his banner; but many people deserted him,
    because Tunne and his men attacked them so boldly, and King Egil
    saw that nothing was left but to fly.  Tunne pursued the
    fugitives into the forest, and then returned to the inhabited
    land, ravaging and plundering without resistance.  All the goods
    that fell into Tunne's hands he gave to his people, and thus
    became popular and strong in men.  King Egil assembledúan army
    again, and hastened to give battle to Tunne.  But Tunne was again
    victorious, and King Egil fled with the loss of many people. 
    Egil and Tunne had eight battles with each other, and Tunne
    always gained the victory.  Then King Egil fled out of the
    country, and went to Sealand in Denmark, to Frode the Bold, and
    promised him a scatt from the Swedes to obtain help.  Frode gave
    him an army, and also his champions, with which force King Egil
    repaired to Sweden.  When Tunne heard this he came out to meet
    him; and there was a great battle, in which Tunne fell, and King
    Egil recovered his kingdom, and the Danes returned home.  King
    Egil sent King Frode great and good presents every year, but he
    paid no scatt to the Danes; but notwithstanding, the friendship
    between Egil and Frode continued without interruption.  After
    Tunne's fall, Egil ruled the kingdom for three years.  It
    happened in Sweden that an old bull, which was destined for
    sacrifice, was fed so high that he became dangerous to people;
    and when they were going to lay hold of him he escaped into the
    woods, became furious, and was long in the forest committing
    great damage to the country.  King Egil was a great hunter, and
    often rode into the forest to chase wild animals.  Once he rode
    out with his men to hunt in the forest.  The king had traced an
    animal a long while, and followed it in the forest, separated
    from all his men.  He observed at last that it was the bull, and
    rode up to it to kill it.  The bull turned round suddenly, and
    the king struck him with his spear; but it tore itself out of the
    wound.  The bull now struck his horn in the side of the horse, so
    that he instantly fell flat on the earth with the king.  The king
    sprang up, and was drawing his sword, when the bull struck his
    horns right into the king's breast.  The king's men then came up
    and killed the bull.  The king lived but a short time, and was
    buried in a mound at Upsal.  Thjodolf sings of it thus: --

         "The fair-haired son of Odin's race,
         Who fled before fierce Tunne's face,
         Has perished by the demon-beast
         Who roams the forests of the East.
         The hero's breast met the full brunt
         Of the wild bull's shaggy front;
         The hero's heart's asunder torn
         By the fell Jotun's spear-like horn."



    31. OF KING OTTAR.

    Ottar was the name of King Egil's son who succeeded to the
    domains and kingdom after him.  He did not continue friendly with
    King Frode, and therefore King Frode sent messengers to King
    Ottar to demand the scatt which Egil had promised him.  Ottar
    replied, that the Swedes had never paid scatt to the Danes,
    neither would he; and the messengers had to depart with this
    answer.  Frode was a great warrior, and he came one summer with
    his army to Sweden, and landed and ravaged the country.  He
    killed many people, took some prisoners, burned all around in the
    inhabited parts, made a great booty, and made great devastation.
    The next summer King Frode made an expedition to the eastward;
    and when King Ottar heard that Frode was not at home in his own
    country, he went on board his own ships, sailed over to Denmark,
    and ravaged there without opposition.  As he heard that a great
    many people were collected at Sealand, he proceeds westward to
    the Sound, and sails north about to Jutland; lands at Lymfjord;
    plunders the Vend district; burns, and lays waste, and makes
    desolate the country he goes over with his army.  Vatt and Faste
    were the names of the earls whom Frode had appointed to defend
    the country in Denmark while he was abroad.  When the earls heard
    that the Swedish king was laying Denmark waste, they collected an
    army, hastened on board their ships, and sailed by the south side
    to Lymfjord.  They came unexpectedly upon Ottar, and the battle
    began immediately.  The Swedes gave them a good reception, and
    many people fell on both sides; but as soon as men fell in the
    Danish army other men hastened from the country to fill their
    places, and also all the vessels in the neighbourhood joined
    them.  The battle ended with the fall of Ottar and the greater
    part of his people.  The Danes took his body, carried it to the
    land, laid it upon a mound of earth, and let the wild beasts and
    ravens tear it to pieces.  Thereafter they made a figure of a
    crow out of wood, sent it to Sweden, and sent word with it that
    their king, Ottar, was no better than it; and from this he was
    called Ottar Vendelcrow.  Thjodolf tells so of it: --

         "By Danish arms the hero bold,
         Ottar the Brave, lies stiff and cold.
         To Vendel's plain the corpse was borne;
         By eagles' claws the corpse is torn,
         Spattered by ravens' bloody feet,
         The wild bird's prey, the wild wolf's meat.
         The Swedes have vowed revenge to take
         On Frode's earls, for Ottar's sake;
         Like dogs to kill them in their land,
         In their own homes, by Swedish hand."



    32. OF KING ADILS' MARRIAGE.

    Adils was the name of King Ottar's son and successor.  He was a
    long time king, became very rich, and went also for several
    summers on viking expeditions.  On one of these he came to
    Saxland with his troops.  There a king was reigning called
    Geirthjof, and his wife was called Alof the Great; but nothing is
    told of their children.  The king was not at home, and Adils and
    his men ran up to the king's house and plundered it, while others
    drove a herd of cattle down to the strand.  The herd was attended
    by slave-people, churls, and girls, and they took all of them
    together.  Among them was a remarkably beautiful girl called
    Yrsa.  Adils returned home with this plunder. Yrsa was not one of
    the slave girls, and it was soon observed that she was
    intelligent, spoke well, and in all respects was well behaved. 
    All people thought well of her, and particularly the king; and at
    last it came to this that the king celebrated his wedding with
    her, and Yrsa became queen of Sweden, and was considered an
    excellent woman.



    33. OF KING ADILS' DEATH.

    King Halfdan's son Helge ruled at that time over Leidre.  He came
    to Sweden with so great an army, that King Adils saw no other way
    than to fly at once.  King Helge landed with his army, plundered,
    and made a great booty.  He took Queen Yrsa prisoner, carried her
    with him to Leidre, took her to wife, and had a son by her called
    Rolf Krake.  When Rolf was three years old, Queen Alof came to
    Denmark, and told Queen Yrsa that her husband, King Helge, was
    her own father, and that she, Alof, was her mother.  Thereupon
    Yrsa went back to Sweden to King Adils, and was queen there as
    long as she lived.  King Helge fell in a war expedition; and Rolf
    Krake, who was then eight years old, was taken to be king in
    Leidre.  King Adils had many disputes with a king called Ole of
    the Uplands; and these kings had a battle on the ice of the
    Venner lake, in which King Ole fell, and King Adils won the
    battle.  There is a long account of this battle in the
    "Skjoldunga Saga", and also about Rolf Krake's coming to Adils,
    and sowing gold upon the Fyrisvold.  King Adils was a great lover
    of good horses, and had the best horses of these times.  One of
    his horses was called Slongve, and another Raven.  This horse he
    had taken from Ole on his death, and bred from him a horse, also
    called Raven, which the king sent in a present to King Godgest in
    Halogaland.  When Godgest mounted the horse he was not able to
    manage him, and fell off and was killed.  This accident happened
    at Omd in Halogaland.  King Adils was at a Disa sacrifice; and as
    he rode around the Disa hall his horse' Raven stumbled and fell,
    and the king was thrown forward upon his head, and his skull was
    split, and his brains dashed out against a stone.  Adils died at
    Upsal, and was buried there in a mound.  The Swedes called him a
    great king.  Thjodolf speaks thus of him: --

         "Witch-demons, I have heard men say,
         Have taken Adils' life away.
         The son of kings of Frey's great race,
         First in the fray, the fight, the chase,
         Fell from his steed -- his clotted brains
         Lie mixed with mire on Upsal's plains.
         Such death (grim Fate has willed it so)
         Has struck down Ole's deadly foe."



    34. ROLF KRAKE'S DEATH.

    Eystein, King Adils' son, ruled next over Sweden, and in his
    lifetime Rolf Krake of Leidre fell.  In those days many kings,
    both Danes and Northmen, ravaged the Swedish dominions; for there
    were many sea-kings who ruled over many people, but had no lands,
    and he might well be called a sea-king who never slept beneath
    sooty roof-timbers.



    35. OF EYSTEIN AND THE JUTLAND KING SOLVE.

    There was a sea-king called Solve, a son of Hogne of Njardo, who
    at that time plundered in the Baltic, but had his dominion in
    Jutland.  He came with his forces to Sweden, just as King Eystein
    was at a feast in a district called Lofond.  Solve came
    unexpectedly in the night on Eystein, surrounded the house in
    which the king was, and burned him and all his court.  Then Solve
    went to Sigtun, and desired that the Swedes should receive him,
    and give him the title of king; but they collected an army, and
    tried to defend the country against him, on which there was a
    great battle, that lasted, according to report, eleven days.
    There King Solve was victorious, and was afterwards king of the
    Swedish dominions for a long time, until at last the Swedes
    betrayed him, and he was killed.  Thjodolf tells of it thus: --

         "For a long time none could tell
         How Eystein died -- but now I know
         That at Lofond the hero fell;
         The branch of Odin was laid low,
         Was burnt by Solve's Jutland men.
         The raging tree-devourer fire
         Rushed on the monarch in its ire;
         First fell the castle timbers, then
         The roof-beams -- Eystein's funeral pyre."



    36. OF YNGVAR'S FALL.

    Yngvar, who was King Eystein's son, then became king of Sweden.
    He was a great warrior, and often lay out with his warships; for
    the Swedish dominions were much ravaged then by Danes and
    East-country men.  King Yngvar made a peace with the Danes; but
    betook himself to ravaging the East country in return.  One
    summer he went with his forces to Estland, and plundered at a
    place called Stein.  The men of Estland came down from the
    interior with a great army, and there was a battle; but the army
    of the country was so brave that the Swedes could not withstand
    them, and King Yngvar fell, and his people fled.  He was buried
    close to the seashore under a mound in Estland; and after this
    defeat the Swedes returned home.  Thjodolf sings of it thus: --

         "Certain it is the Estland foe
         The fair-haired Swedish king laid low.
         On Estland's strand, o'er Swedish graves,
         The East Sea sings her song of waves;
         King Yngvar's dirge is ocean's roar
         Resounding on the rock-ribbed shore."



    37. OF ONUND THE LAND-CLEARER.

    Onund was the name of Yngvar's son who succeeded him.  In his
    days there was peace in Sweden, and he became rich in valuable
    goods.  King Onund went with his army to Estland to avenge his
    father, and landed and ravaged the country round far and wide,
    and returned with a great booty in autumn to Sweden.  In his time
    there were fruitful seasons in Sweden, so that he was one of the
    most popular of kings.  Sweden is a great forest land, and there
    are such great uninhabited forests in it that it is a journey of
    many days to cross them.  Onund bestowed great diligence and
    expense on opening the woods and cultivating the cleared land. 
    He made roads through the desert forests; and thus cleared land
    is found all through the forest country, and great districts are
    settled.  In this way extensive tracts of land were brought into
    cultivation, for there were country people enough to cultivate
    the land.  Onund had roads made through all Sweden, both through
    forests and morasses, and also over mountains; and he was
    therefore called Onund Roadmaker.  He had a house built for
    himself in every district of Sweden, and went over the whole
    country in guest-quarters.



    38. OF INGJALD THE BAD.

    Onund had a son called Ingjald, and at that time Yngvar was king
    of the district of Fjadryndaland.  Yngvar had two sons by his
    wife -- the one called Alf, the other Agnar -- who were about the
    same age as Ingjald.  Onund's district-kings were at that time
    spread widely over Sweden, and Svipdag the Blind ruled over
    Tiundaland, in which Upsal is situated, and where all the Swedish
    Things are held.  There also were held the mid-winter sacrifices,
    at which many kings attended.  One year at midwinter there was a
    great assembly of people at Upsal, and King Yngvar had also come
    there with his sons.  Alf, King Yngvar's son, and Ingjald, King
    Onund's son, were there -- both about six years old.  They amused
    themselves with child's play, in which each should be leading on
    his army.  In their play Ingjald found himself not so strong as
    Alf, and was so vexed that he almost cried.  His foster-brother
    Gautvid came up, led him to his foster-father Svipdag the Blind,
    and told him how ill it appeared that he was weaker and less
    manly than Alf, King Yngvar's son.  Svipdag replied that it was a
    great shame.  The day after Svipdag took the heart of a wolf,
    roasted it on the tongs, and gave it to the king's son Ingjald to
    eat, and from that time he became a most ferocious person, and of
    the worst disposition.  When Ingjald was grown up, Onund applied
    for him to King Algaut for his daughter Gauthild.  Algaut was a
    son of Gautrek the Mild, and grandson of Gaut; and from them
    Gotland (Gautland) took its name.  King Algaut thought his
    daughter would be well married if she got King Onund's son, and
    if he had his father's disposition; so the girl was sent to
    Sweden, and King Ingjald celebrated his wedding with her in due
    time.



    39. OF KING ONUND'S DEATH.

    King Onund one autumn, travelling between his mansion-houses,
    came over a road called Himmenheath, where there are some narrow
    mountain valleys, with high mountains on both sides.  There was
    heavy rain at the time, and before there had been snow on the
    mountains.  A landslip of clay and stones came down upon King
    Onund and his people, and there he met his death, and many with
    him.  So says Thjodolf, namely: --

         "We all have heard how Jonkur's sons,
         Whom weapons could not touch, with stones
         Were stoned to death in open day,
         King Onund died in the same way.
         Or else perhaps the wood-grown land,
         Which long had felt his conquering hand,
         Uprose at length in deadly strife,
         And pressed out Onund's hated life."



    40. THE BURNING IN UPSAL.

    Then Ingjald, King Onund's son, came to the kingdom.  The Upsal
    kings were the highest in Sweden among the many district-kings
    who had been since the time that Odin was chief.  The kings who
    resided at Upsal had been the supreme chiefs over the whole
    Swedish dominions until the death of Agne, when, as before
    related, the kingdom came to be divided between brothers.  After
    that time the dominions and kingly powers were spread among the
    branches of the family as these increased; but some kings cleared
    great tracts of forest-land, and settled them, and thereby
    increased their domains.  Now when Ingjald took the dominions and
    the kingdom of his father, there were, as before said, many
    district-kings.  King Ingjald ordered a great feast to be
    prepared in Upsal, and intended at that feast to enter on his
    heritage after King Onund his father.  He had a large hall made
    ready for the occasion -- one not less, nor less sumptuous, than
    that of Upsal; and this hall was called the Seven Kings Hall, and
    in it were seven high seats for kings.  Then King Ingjald sent
    men all through Sweden, and invited to his feast kings, earls,
    and other men of consequence.  To this heirship-feast came King
    Algaut, his father-in-law; Yngvar king of Fjadryndaland, with his
    two sons, Alf and Agnar; King Sporsnjall of Nerike; King Sighvat
    of Aattundaland: but Granmar king of Sodermanland did not come.
    Six kings were placed in the seats in the new hall; but one of
    the high seats which Ingjald had prepared was empty.  All the
    persons who had come got places in the new hall; but to his own
    court, and the rest of his people, he had appointed places at
    Upsal.  It was the custom at that time that he who gave an
    heirship-feast after kings or earls, and entered upon the
    heritage, should sit upon the footstool in front of the high
    seat, until the full bowl, which was called the Brage-beaker, was
    brought in.  Then he should stand up, take the Brage-beaker, make
    solemn vows to be afterwards fulfilled, and thereupon empty the
    beaker.  Then he should ascend the high seat which his father had
    occupied; and thus he came to the full heritage after his father.
    Now it was done so on this occasion.  When the full Brage-beaker
    came in, King Ingjald stood up, grasped a large bull's horn, and
    made a solemn vow to enlarge his dominions by one half, towards
    all the four corners of the world, or die; and thereupon pointed
    with the horn to the four quarters.  Now when the guests had
    become drunk towards evening King Ingjald told Svipdag's sons,
    Gautvid and Hylvid, to arm themselves and their men, as had
    before been settled; and accordingly they went out, and came up
    to the new hall, and set fire to it.  The hall was soon in a
    blaze, and the six kings, with all their people, were burned in
    it.  Those who tried to come out were killed.  Then King Ingjald
    laid all the dominions these kings had possessed under himself,
    and took scatt from them.



    41. OF HJORVARD'S MARRIAGE.

    When King Granmar heard the news of this treachery, he thought
    the same lot awaited him if he did not take care.  The same
    summer King Hjorvard, who was called Ylfing, came with his fleet
    to Sweden, and went into a fjord called Myrkva-fjord.  When King
    Granmar heard this he sent a messenger to him to invite him and
    all his men to a feast.  He accepted it willingly; for he had
    never committed waste in King Granmar's dominions.  When he came
    to the feast he was gladly welcomed.  In the evening, when the
    full bowls went round, as was the custom of kings when they were
    at home, or in the feasts they ordered to be made, they sat and
    drank together, a man and woman with each other in pairs, and the
    rest of the company sat and drank all together.  But it was the
    law among the vikings that all who were at the entertainment
    should drink together in one company all round.  King Hjorvard's
    high seat was placed right opposite to King Granmar's high seat,
    and on the same bench sat all his men.  King Granmar told his
    daughter Hildigunn, who was a remarkably beautiful girl, to make
    ready to carry ale to the vikings.  Thereupon she took a silver
    goblet, filled it, bowed before King Hjorvard, and said, "Success
    to all Ylfinger: this cup to the memory of Rolf Krake" -- drank
    out the half, and handed the cup to King Hjorvard.  He took the
    cup, and took her hand, and said she must sit beside him.  She
    says that is not viking fashion to drink two and two with women.
    Hjorvard replies that it were better for him to make a change,
    and leave the viking law, and drink in company with her.  Then
    Hildigunn sat down beside him, and both drank together, and spoke
    a great deal with each other during the evening.  The next day,
    when King Granmar and Hjorvard met, Hjorvard spoke of his
    courtship, and asked to have Hildigunn in marriage.  King Granmar
    laid this proposal before his wife Hilda, and before people of
    consequence, saying they would have great help and trust in
    Hjorvard; and all approved of it highly, and thought it very
    advisable.  And the end was, that Hildigunn was promised to
    Hjorvard, and the wedding followed soon after; and King Hjorvard
    stayed with King Granmar, who had no sons, to help him to defend
    his dominions.



    42. WAR BETWEEN INGJALD AND GRANMAR AND HJORVARD.

    The same autumn King Ingjald collected a war-force, with which he
    intended to fall upon Granmar and Hjorvard; but when they heard
    it they also collected a force, and Hogne, who ruled over East
    Gotland, together with his son Hildur, came to their assistance.
    Hogne was father of Hilda, who was married to King Granmar.  King
    Ingjald landed with his army, which was by far the most numerous.
    A battle began, which was very sharp; but after it had lasted a
    short time, the chiefs who ruled over Fjadryndaland, West
    Gotland, Nerike, and Aattundaland, took to flight with all the
    men from those countries, and hastened to their ships.  This
    placed King Ingjald in great danger, and he received many wounds,
    but escaped by flight to his ships.  Svipdag the Blind, Ingjald's
    foster-father, together with his sons, Gautvid and Hylvid, fell.
    Ingjald returned to Upsal, very ill-satisfied with his
    expedition; and he thought the army levied from those countries
    he had acquired by conquest had been unfaithful to him.  There
    was great hostility afterwards between King Ingjald and King
    Granmar, and his son-in-law King Hjorvard; and after this had
    continued a long time the friends of both parties brought about a
    reconciliation.  The king appointed a meeting, and concluded a
    peace.  This peace was to endure as long as the three kings
    lived, and this was confirmed by oath and promises of fidelity.
    The spring after, King Granmar went to Upsal to make offering, as
    usual, for a steady peace.  Then the foreboding turned out for
    him so that it did not promise him long life, and he returned to
    his dominions.



    43. DEATH OF THE KINGS GRANMAR AND HJORVARD.

    The autumn after, King Granmar and his son-in-law Hjorvard went
    to a feast at one of their farms in the island Sile.  When they
    were at the entertainment, King Ingjald came there in the night
    with his troops, surrounded the house, and burnt them in it, with
    all their men.  Then he took to himself all the country these
    kings had possessed, and placed chiefs over it.  King Hogne and
    his son Hildur often made inroads on horseback into the Swedish
    dominions, and killed King Ingjald's men, whom he had placed over
    the kingdom which had belonged to their relation Granmar.  This
    strife between King Ingjald and King Hogne continued for a long
    time; but King Hogne defended his kingdom against King Ingjald to
    his dying day.  King Ingjald had two children by his wife -- the
    eldest called Aasa, the other Olaf.  Gauthild, the wife of
    Ingjald, sent the boy to his foster-father Bove, in West Gotland,
    where he was brought up along with Saxe, Bove's son, who had the
    surname of Flette.  It was a common saying that King Ingjald had
    killed twelve kings, and deceived them all under pretence of
    peace; therefore he was called Ingjald the Evil-adviser.  He was
    king over the greater part of Sweden.  He married his daughter
    Aasa to Gudrod king of Scania; and she was like her father in
    disposition.  Aasa brought it about that Gudrod killed his
    brother Halfdan, father of Ivar Vidfavne; and also she brought
    about the death of her husband Gudrod, and then fled to her
    father; and she thus got the name also of Aasa the Evil-adviser. 


    44. OF INGJALD'S DEATH.

    Ivar Vidfavne came to Scania after the fall of his uncle Gudrod,
    and collected an army in all haste, and moved with it into
    Sweden.  Aasa had gone to her father before.  King Ingjald was at
    a feast in Raening, when he heard that King Ivar's army was in
    the neighbourhood.  Ingjald thought he had not strength to go
    into battle against Ivar, and he saw well that if he betook
    himself to flight his enemies would swarm around him from all
    corners.  He and Aasa took a resolution which has become
    celebrated.  They drank until all their people were dead drunk,
    and then put fire to the hall; and it was consumed, with all who
    were in it, including themselves, King Ingjald, and Aasa.  Thus
    says Thjodolf: --

         "With fiery feet devouring flame
         Has hunted down a royal game
         At Raening, where King Ingjald gave
         To all his men one glowing grave.
         On his own hearth the fire he raised,
         A deed his foemen even praised;
         By his own hand he perished so,
         And life for freedom did forego."



    45. OF IVAR.

    Ivar Vidfavne subdued the whole of Sweden.  He brought in
    subjection to himself all the Danish dominions, a great deal of
    Saxland, all the East Country, and a fifth part of England.  From
    his race the kings of Sweden and Denmark who have had the supreme
    authority in those countries, are descended.  After Ingjald the
    Evil-adviser the Upsal dominion fell from the Yngling race
    notwithstanding the length of time they could reckon up the
    series of their forefathers.



    46. OF OLAF THE TREE-FELLER.

    When Olaf, King Ingjald's son, heard of his father's end, he went
    with the men who chose to follow him to Nerike; for all the
    Swedish community rose with one accord to drive out Ingjald's
    family and all his friends.  Now, when the Swedes got
    intelligence of him he could not remain there, but went on
    westwards, through the forest, to a river which comes from the
    north and falls into the Venner lake, and is called Klar river. 
    There they sat themselves down, turned to and cleared the woods,
    burnt, and then settled there.  Soon there were great districts;
    which altogether were called Vermeland; and a good living was to
    be made there.  Now when it was told of Olaf, in Sweden, that he
    was clearing the forests, they laughed at his proceedings, and
    called him the Tree-feller.  Olaf got a wife called Solva, or
    Solveig, a daughter of Halfdan Guldtand, westward in Soleyar.
    Halfdan was a son of Solve Solvarson, who was a son of Solve the
    Old, who first settled on these islands.  Olaf Tree-feller's
    mother was called Gauthild, and her mother was Alov, daughter of
    Olaf the Sharp-sighted, king in Nerike.  Olaf and Solva had two
    sons: Ingjald and Halfdan.  Halfdan was brought up in Soleyar, in
    the house of his mother's brother Solve, and was called Halfdan
    Hvitbein.



    47. OLAF THE TREE-FELLER'S DEATH.

    There were a great many people who fled the country from Sweden,
    on account of King Ivar; and when they heard that King Olaf had
    got good lands in Vermeland, so great a number came there to him
    that the land could not support them.  Then there came dear times
    and famine, which they ascribed to their king; as the Swedes used
    always to reckon good or bad crops for or against their kings.
    The Swedes took it amiss that Olaf was sparing in his sacrifices,
    and believed the dear times must proceed from this cause.  The
    Swedes therefore gathered together troops, made an expedition
    against King Olaf, surrounded his house and burnt him in it,
    giving him to Odin as a sacrifice for good crops.  This happened
    at the Venner lake.  Thus tells Thjodolf of it: --

         "The temple wolf, by the lake shores,
         The corpse of Olaf now devours.
         The clearer of the forests died
         At Odin's shrine by the lake side.
         The glowing flames stripped to the skin
         The royal robes from the Swedes' king.
         Thus Olaf, famed in days of yore,
         Vanished from earth at Venner's shore."



    48. HALFDAN HVITBEIN MADE KING.

    Those of the Swedes who had more understanding found that the
    dear times proceeded from there being a greater number of people
    on the land than it could support, and that the king could not be
    blamed for this.  They took the resolution, therefore, to cross
    the Eida forest with all their men, and came quite unexpectedly
    into Soleyar, where they put to death King Solve, and took
    Halfdan Hvitbein prisoner, and made him their chief, and gave him
    the title of king.  Thereupon he subdued Soleyar, and proceeding
    with his army into Raumarike, plundered there, and laid that
    district also in subjection by force of arms.



    49. OF HALFDAN HVITBEIN.

    Halfdan Hvitbein became a great king.  He was married to Aasa, a
    daughter of Eystein the Severe, who was king of the Upland
    people, and ruled over Hedemark.  Halfdan and Aasa had two sons,
    Eystein and Gudrod.  Halfdan subdued a great part of Hedemark,
    Toten, Hadeland, and much of Westfold.  He lived to be an old
    man, and died in his bed at Toten, from whence his body was
    transported to Westfold, and was buried under a mound at a place
    called Skaereid, at Skiringsale.  So says Thjodolf: --

         "Halfdan, esteemed by friends and foes,
         Receives at last life's deep repose:
         The aged man at last, though late,
         Yielded in Toten to stern fate.
         At Skiringsale hangs o'er his grave
         A rock, that seems to mourn the brave Halfdan,
         to chiefs and people dear,
         Received from all a silent tear."



    50. OF INGJALD, BROTHER OF HALFDAN.

    Ingjald, Halfdan's brother, was king of Vermeland; but after his
    death King Halfdan took possession of Vermeland, raised scatt
    from it, and placed earls over it as long as he lived.



    51. OF KING EYSTEIN'S DEATH.

    Eystein, Halfdan Hvitbein's son, became king after in Raumarike
    and Westfold.  He was married to Hild, a daughter of Eric
    Agnarsson, who was king in Westfold.  Agnar, Eric's father, was a
    son of Sigtryg, king in the Vend district.  King Eric had no son,
    and died while King Halfdan Hvitbein was still in life.  The
    father and son, Halfdan and Eystein, then took possession of the
    whole of Westfold, which Eystein ruled over as long as he lived.
    At that time there lived at Varna a king called Skjold, who was a
    great warlock.  King Eystein went with some ships of war to
    Varna, plundered there, and carried away all he could find of
    clothes or other valuables, and of peasants' stock, and killed
    cattle on the strand for provision, and then went off.  King
    Skjold came to the strand with his army, just as Eystein was at
    such a distance over the fjord that King Skjold could only see
    his sails.  Then he took his cloak, waved it, and blew into it.
    King Eystein was sitting at the helm as they sailed in past
    Jarls, and another ship was sailing at the side of his, when
    there came a stroke of a wave, by which the boom of the other
    ship struck the king and threw him overboard, which proved his
    death.  His men fished up his body, and it was carried into
    Borre, where a mound was thrown up over it, out towards the sea
    at Raden, near Vodle.  So says Thjodolf: --

         "King Eystein sat upon the poop
         Of his good ship: with sudden swoop
         The swinging boom dashed him to hell,
         And fathoms deep the hero fell
         Beneath the brine.  The fury whirl
         Of Loke, Tempest's brother's girl,
         Grim Hel, clutched his soul away;
         And now where Vodle's ocean bay
         Receives the ice-cold stream, the grave
         Of Eystein stands -- the good, the brave!"



    52. OF HALFDAN THE MILD. 

    Halfdan was the name of King Eystein's son who succeeded him.  He
    was called Halfdan the Mild, but the Bad Entertainer; that is to
    say, he was reported to be generous, and to give his men as much
    gold as other kings gave of silver, but he starved them in their
    diet.  He was a great warrior, who had been long on viking
    cruises, and had collected great property.  He was married to
    Liv, a daughter of King Dag of Westmare.  Holtar, in Westfold,
    was his chief house; and he died there on the bed of sickness,
    and was buried at Borre under a mound.  So says Thjodolf: --

         "By Hel's summons, a great king
         Was called away to Odin's Thing:
         King Halfdan, he who dwelt of late
         At Holtar, must obey grim Fate.
         At Borre, in the royal mound,
         They laid the hero in the ground."



    53. OF GUDROD THE HUNTER.

    Gudrod, Halfdan's son, succeeded.  He was called Gudrod the
    Magnificent, and also Gudrod the Hunter.  He was married to
    Alfhild, a daughter of King Alfarin of Alfheim, and got with her
    half the district of Vingulmark.  Their son Olaf was afterwards
    called Geirstad-Alf.  Alfheim, at that time, was the name of the
    land between the Glommen and Gotha rivers.  Now when Alfhild
    died, King Gudrod sent his men west to Agder to the king who
    ruled there, and who was called Harald Redbeard.  They were to
    make proposals to his daughter Aasa upon the king's account; but
    Harald declined the match, and the ambassadors returned to the
    king, and told him the result of their errand.  Soon after King
    Gudrod hove down his ships into the water, and proceeded with a
    great force in them to Agder.  He immediately landed, and came
    altogether unexpectedly at night to King Harald's house.  When
    Harald was aware that an army was at hand, he went out with the
    men he had about him, and there was a great battle, although he
    wanted men so much.  King Harald and his son Gyrd fell, and King
    Gudrod took a great booty.  He carried away with him Aasa, King
    Harald's daughter, and had a wedding with her.  They had a son by
    their marriage called Halfdan; and the autumn that Halfdan was a
    year old Gudrod went upon a round of feasts.  He lay with his
    ship in Stiflesund, where they had been drinking hard, so that
    the king was very tipsy.  In the evening, about dark, the king
    left the ship; and when he had got to the end of the gangway from
    the ship to the shore, a man ran against him, thrust a spear
    through him, and killed him.  The man was instantly put to death,
    and in the morning when it was light the man was discovered to be
    Aasa's page-boy: nor did she conceal that it was done by her
    orders.  Thus tells Thjodolf of it: --

         "Gudrod is gone to his long rest,
         Despite of all his haughty pride --
         A traitor's spear has pierced his side:
         For Aasa cherished in her breast
         Revenge; and as, by wine opprest,
         The hero staggered from his ship,
         The cruel queen her thrall let slip
         To do the deed of which I sing:
         And now the far-descended king,
         At Stiflesund, in the old bed
         Of the old Gudrod race, lies dead."



    54. OF KING OLAF'S DEATH.

    Olaf came to the kingdom after his father.  He was a great
    warrior, and an able man; and was besides remarkably handsome,
    very strong and large of growth.  He had Westfold; for King
    Alfgeir took all Vingulmark to himself, and placed his son
    Gandalf over it.  Both father and son made war on Raumarike, and
    subdued the greater part of that land and district.  Hogne was
    the name of a son of the Upland king, Eystein the Great, who
    subdued for himself the whole of Hedemark, Toten, and Hadeland.
    Then Vermeland fell off from Gudrod's sons, and turned itself,
    with its payment of scatt, to the Swedish king.  Olaf was about
    twenty years old when Gudrod died; and as his brother Halfdan now
    had the kingdom with him, they divided it between them; so that
    Olaf got the eastern and Halfdan the southern part.  King Olaf
    had his main residence at Geirstad.  There he died of a disease
    in his foot, and was laid under a mound at Geirstad.  So sings
    Thjodolf: --

         "Long while this branch of Odin's stem
         Was the stout prop of Norway's realm;
         Long while King Olaf with just pride
         Ruled over Westfold far and wide.
         At length by cruel gout oppressed,
         The good King Olaf sank to rest:
         His body now lies under ground,
         Buried at Geirstad, in the mound."



    55. OF ROGNVALD THE MOUNTAIN-HIGH.

    Rognvald was the name of Olaf's son who was king of Westfold
    after his father.  He was called "Mountain-high," and Thjodolf of
    Hvina composed for him the "Ynglinga-tal", in which he says: -- 

         "Under the heaven's blue dome, a name
         I never knew more true to fame
         Than Rognvald bore; whose skilful hand
         Could tame the scorners of the land, --
         Rognvald, who knew so well to guide
         The wild sea-horses through the tide:
         The "Mountain-high" was the proud name
         By which the king was known to fame."
