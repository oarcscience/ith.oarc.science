    SAGA OF HAKON HERDEBREID (HAKON THE BROAD-SHOULDERED) (1)



    PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

    This saga describes the feud between Hakon Sigurdson and his
    uncle Inge.

    The only skald quoted is Einar Skulason.


    ENDNOTES:
    (1)  The period is from A.D. 1157 to 1161. -- L.



    1. BEGINNING OF HAKON HERDEBREID.

    Hakon, King Sigurd's son, was chosen chief of the troop which had
    followed King Eystein, and his adherents gave him the title of
    king.  He was ten years old.  At that time he had with him
    Sigurd, a son of Halvard Hauld of Reyr, and Andreas and Onund,
    the sons of Simon, his foster-brothers, and many chiefs, friends
    of King Sigurd and King Eystein; and they went first up to
    Gautland.  King Inge took possession of all the estates they had
    left behind, and declared them banished.  Thereafter King Inge
    went to Viken, and was sometimes also in the north of the
    country.  Gregorius Dagson was in Konungahella, where the danger
    was greatest, and had beside him a strong and handsome body of
    men, with which he defended the country.



    2. OF GREGORIUS DAGSON.

    The summer after (A.D. 1158) Hakon came with his men, and
    proceeded to Konungahella with a numerous and handsome troop.
    Gregorius was then in the town, and summoned the bondes and
    townspeople to a great Thing, at which he desired their aid; but
    he thought the people did not hear him with much favour, so he
    did not much trust them.  Gregorius set off with two ships to
    Viken, and was very much cast down.  He expected to meet King
    Inge there, having heard he was coming with a great army to
    Viken.  Now when Gregorius had come but a short way north he met
    Simon Skalp, Haldor Brynjolfson, and Gyrd Amundason, King Inge's
    foster-brothers.  Gregorius was much delighted at this meeting,
    and turned back with them, being all in one body, with eleven
    ships.  As they were rowing up to Konungahella, Hakon, with his
    followers, was holding a Thing without the town, and saw their
    approach; and Sigurd of Reyr said, "Gregorius must be fey to be
    throwing himself with so few men into our hands."  Gregorius
    landed opposite the town to wait for King Inge, for he was
    expected, but he did not come.  King Hakon put himself in order
    in the town, and appointed Thorliot Skaufaskalle, who was a
    viking and a robber, to be captain of the men in the merchant
    ships that were afloat in the river; and King Hakon and Sigurd
    were within the town, and drew up the men on the piers, for all
    the townspeople had submitted to King Hakon.



    3. KING HAKON'S FLIGHT.

    Gregorius rowed up the river, and let the ship drive down with
    the stream against Thorliot.  They shot at each other a while,
    until Thorliot and his comrades jumped overboard; and some of
    them were killed, some escaped to the land.  Then Gregorius rowed
    to the piers, and let a gangway be cast on shore at the very feet
    of Hakon's men.  There the man who carried his banner was slain,
    just as he was going to step on shore.  Gregorius ordered Hal, a
    son of Audun Halson, to take up the banner, which he did, and
    bore the banner up to the pier.  Gregorius followed close after
    him, held his shield over his head, and protected him as well as
    himself.  As soon as Gregorius came upon the pier, and Hakon's
    men knew him, they gave way, and made room for him on every side.
    Afterwards more people landed from the ships, and then Gregorius
    made a severe assault with his men; and Hakon's men first moved
    back, and then ran up into the town.  Gregorius pursued them
    eagerly, drove them twice from the town, and killed many of them.
    By the report of all men, never was there so glorious an affair
    as this of Gregorius; for Hakon had more than 4000 men, and
    Gregorius not full 400.  After the battle, Gregorius said to Hal
    Audunson, "Many men, in my opinion, are more agile in battle than
    ye Icelanders are, for ye are not so exercised as we Norwegians;
    but none, I think, are so bold under arms as ye are."  King Inge
    came up soon after, and killed many of the men who had taken part
    with Hakon; made some pay heavy fines, burnt the houses of some,
    and some he drove out of the country, or treated otherwise very
    ill.  Hakon fled at first up to Gautland with all his men; but
    the winter after (A.D. 1159), he proceeded by the upper road to
    Throndhjem, and came there before Easter.  The Throndhjem people
    received him well, for they had always served under that shield.
    It is said that the Throndhjem people took Hakon as king, on the
    terms that he should have from Inge the third part of Norway as
    his paternal heritage.  King Inge and Gregorius were in Viken,
    and Gregorius wanted to make an expedition against the party in
    the north; but it came to nothing that winter, as many dissuaded
    from it.



    4. FALL OF GYRD AND HAVARD.

    King Hakon left Throndhjem in spring with thirty ships nearly;
    and some of his men sailed before the rest with seven ships, and
    plundered in North and South More.  No man could remember that
    there ever before had been plundering between the two towns
    (Bergen and Nidaros).  Jon the son of Halkel Huk collected the
    bondes in arms, and proceeded against them; took Kolbein Ode
    prisoner, killed every woman's son of them in his ship.  Then
    they searched for the others, found them all assembled in seven
    ships, and fought with them; but his father Halkel not coming to
    his assistance as he had promised, many good bondes were killed,
    and Jon himself was wounded.  Hakon proceeded south to Bergen
    with his forces; but when he came to Stiornvelta, he heard that
    King Inge and Gregorius had arrived a few nights before from the
    east at Bergen, and therefore he did not venture to steer
    thither.  They sailed the outer course southwards past Bergen,
    and met three ships of King Inge's fleet, which had been
    outsailed on the voyage from the east.  On board of them were
    Gyrd Amundason, King Inge's foster-brother, who was married to
    Gyrid a sister of Gregorius, and also lagman Gyrd Gunhildson, and
    Havard Klining.  King Hakon had Gyrd Amundason and Havard Klining
    put to death; but took lagman Gyrd southwards, and then proceeded
    east to Viken.



    5. OF THE CONSULTATIONS OF KING INGE.

    When King Inge heard of this he sailed east after them, and they
    met east in the Gaut river.  King Inge went up the north arm of
    the river, and sent out spies to get news of Hakon and his fleet;
    but he himself landed at Hising, and waited for his spies.  Now
    when the spies came back they went to the king, and said that
    they had seen King Hakon's forces, and all his ships which lay at
    the stakes in the river, and Hakon's men had bound the stems of
    their vessels to them.  They had two great East-country trading
    vessels, which they had laid outside of the fleet, and on both
    these were built high wooded stages (castles).  When King Inge
    heard the preparations they had made, he ordered a trumpet to
    call a House-thing of all the men; and when the Thing was seated
    he asked his men for counsel, and applied particularly to
    Gregorius Dagson, his brother-in-law Erling Skakke, and other
    lendermen and ship-commanders, to whom he related the
    preparations of Hakon and his men.

    Then Gregorius Dagson replied first, and made known his mind in
    the following words: -- "Sometimes we and Hakon have met, and
    generally they had the most people; but, notwithstanding, they
    fell short in battle against us.  Now, on the other hand, we have
    by far the greatest force; and it will appear probable to the men
    who a short time ago lost gallant relations by them, that this
    will be a good occasion to get vengeance, for they have fled
    before us the greater part of the summer; and we have often said
    that if they waited for us, as appears now to be the case, we
    would have a brush with them.  Now I will tell my opinion, which
    is, that I will engage them, if it be agreeable to the king's
    pleasure; for I think it will go now as formerly, that they must
    give way before us if we attack them bravely; and I shall always
    attack where others may think it most difficult."

    The speech was received with much applause, and all declared they
    were ready to engage in battle against Hakon.  Then they rowed
    with all the ships up the river, until they came in sight of each
    other, and then King Inge turned off from the river current under
    the island.  Now the king addressed the lendermen again, and told
    them to get ready for battle.  He turned himself especially to
    Erling Skakke, and said, what was true, that no man in the army
    had more understanding and knowledge in fighting battles,
    although some were more hot.  The king then addressed himself to
    several of the lendermen, speaking to them by name; and ended by
    desiring that each man should make his attack where he thought it
    would be of advantage, and thereafter all would act together.



    6. ERLING'S SPEECH.

    Erling Skakke replied thus to the king's speech: "It is my duty,
    sire, not to be silent; and I shall give my advice, since it is
    desired.  The resolution now adopted is contrary to my judgment;
    for I call it foolhardy to fight under these circumstances,
    although we have so many and such fine men.  Supposing we make an
    attack on them, and row up against this river-current; then one
    of the three men who are in each half room must be employed in
    rowing only, and another must be covering with the shield the man
    who rows; and what have we then to fight with but one third of
    our men?  It appears to me that they can be of little use in the
    battle who are sitting at their oars with their backs turned to
    the enemy.  Give me now some time for consideration, and I
    promise you that before three days are over I shall fall upon
    some plan by which we can come into battle with advantage."

    It was evident from Erling's speech that he dissuaded from an
    attack; but, notwithstanding, it was urged by many who thought
    that Hakon would now, as before, take to the land.  "And then,"
    said they, "we cannot get hold of him; but now they have but few
    men, and we have their fate in our own hands."

    Gregorius said but little; but thought that Erling rather
    dissuaded from an attack that Gregorius's advice should have no
    effect, than that he had any better advice to give.



    7. OF HAKON'S FLEET.

    Then said King Inge to Erling, "Now we will follow thy advice,
    brother, with regard to the manner of attacking; but seeing how
    eager our counsellors are for it, we shall make the attack this
    day."

    Erling replied, "All the boats and light vessels we have should
    row outside the island, and up the east arm of the river, and
    then down with the stream upon them, and try if they cannot cut
    them loose from the piles.  Then we, with the large ships, shall
    row from below here against them; and I cannot tell until it be
    tried, if those who are now so furiously warm will be much
    brisker at the attack than I am."

    This counsel was approved by all.  There was a ness stretched out
    between their fleet and Hakon's, so that they could not see each
    other.  Now when Hakon and his men, who had taken counsel with
    each other in a meeting, saw the boat-squadron rowing down the
    river, some thought King Inge intended to give them battle; but
    many believed they did not dare, for it looked as if the attack
    was given up; and they, besides, were very confident, both in
    their preparations and men.  There were many great people with
    Hakon: there were Sigurd of Reyr, and Simon's sons; Nikolas
    Skialdvarson; Eindride, a son of Jon Mornef, who was the most
    gallant and popular man in the Throndhjem country; and many other
    lendermen and warriors.  Now when they saw that King Inge's men
    with many ships were rowing out of the river, Hakon and his men
    believed they were going to fly; and therefore they cut their
    land-ropes with which they lay fast at the piles, seized their
    oars, and rowed after them in pursuit.  The ships ran fast down
    with the stream; but when they came further down the river,
    abreast of the ness, they saw King Inge's main strength lying
    quiet at the island Hising.  King Inge's people saw Hakon's ships
    under way, and believed they were coming to attack them; and now
    there was great bustle and clash of arms, and they encouraged
    each other by a great war-shout.  Hakon with his fleet turned
    northwards a little to the land, where there was a turn in the
    bight of the river, and where there was no current.  They made
    ready for battle, carried land-ropes to the shore, turned the
    stems of their ships outwards, and bound them all together.  They
    laid the large East-country traders without the other vessels,
    the one above, the other below, and bound them to the long-ships.
    In the middle of the fleet lay the king's ship, and next to it
    Sigurd's; and on the other side of the king's ship lay Nikolas,
    and next to him Endride Jonson.  All the smaller ships lay
    farther off, and they were all nearly loaded with weapons and
    stones.



    8. SIGURD OF REYR'S SPEECH.

    Then Sigurd of Reyr made the following speech: "Now there is hope
    that the time is come which has been promised us all the summer,
    that we shall meet King Inge in battle.  We have long prepared
    ourselves for this; and many of our comrades have boasted that
    they would never fly from or submit to King Inge and Gregorius,
    and now let them remember their words.  But we who have sometimes
    got the toothache in our conflicts with them, speak less
    confidently; for it has happened, as all have heard, that we very
    often have come off without glory.  But, nevertheless, it is now
    necessary to fight manfully, and stand to it with steadiness; for
    the only escape for us is in victory.  Although we have somewhat
    fewer men than they, yet luck determines which side shall have
    the advantage, and God knows that the right is on our side.  Inge
    has killed two of his brothers; and it is obvious to all men that
    the mulct he intends to pay King Hakon for his father's murder is
    to murder him also, as well as his other relations, which will be
    seen this day to be his intent.  King Hakon desired from the
    beginning no more of Norway than the third part, which his father
    had possessed, and which was denied him; and yet, in my opinion,
    King Hakon has a better right to inherit after his father's
    brother, King Eystein, than Inge or Simon Skalp, or the other men
    who killed King Eystein.  Many of them who would save their
    souls, and yet have defiled their hands with such bloody deeds as
    Inge has done, must think it a presumption before God that he
    takes the name of king; and I wonder God suffers such monstrous
    wickedness as his; but it may be God's will that we shall now put
    him down.  Let us fight then manfully, and God will give us
    victory; and, if we fall, will repay us with joys unspeakable for
    now allowing the might of the wicked to prevail over us.  Go
    forth then in confidence, and be not afraid when the battle
    begins.  Let each watch over his own and his comrade's safety,
    and God protect us all."  There went a good report abroad of this
    speech of Sigurd, and all promised fairly, and to do their duty.
    King Hakon went on board of the great East-country ship, and a
    shield-bulwark was made around him; but his standard remained on
    the long-ship in which it had been before.



    9. OF KING INGE'S MEN.

    Now must we tell about King Inge and his men.  When they saw that
    King Hakon and his people were ready for battle, and the river
    only was between them, they sent a light vessel to recall the
    rest of the fleet which had rowed away; and in the meantime the
    king waited for them, and arranged the troops for the attack.
    Then the chiefs consulted in presence of the army, and told their
    opinions; first, which ships should lie nearest to the enemy; and
    then where each should attack.

    Gregorius spoke thus: "We have many and fine men; and it is my
    advice, King Inge, that you do not go to the assault with us, for
    everything is preserved if you are safe.  And no man knows where
    an arrow may hit, even from the hands of a bad bowman; and they
    have prepared themselves so, that missiles and stones can be
    thrown from the high stages upon the merchant ships, so that
    there is less danger for those who are farthest from them.  They
    have not more men than we lendermen can very well engage with.  I
    shall lay my ship alongside their largest ship, and I expect the
    conflict between us will be but short; for it has often been so
    in our former meetings, although there has been a much greater
    want of men with us than now."  All thought well of the advice
    that the king himself should not take part in the battle.

    Then Erling Skakke said, "I agree also to the counsel that you,
    sire, should not go into the battle.  It appears to me that their
    preparations are such, that we require all our precaution not to
    suffer a great defeat from them; and whole limbs are the easiest
    cured.  In the council we held before to-day many opposed what I
    said, and ye said then that I did not want to fight; but now I
    think the business has altered its appearance, and greatly to our
    advantage, since they have hauled off from the piles, and now it
    stands so that I do not dissuade from giving battle; for I see,
    what all are sensible of, how necessary it is to put an end to
    this robber band who have gone over the whole country with
    pillage and destruction, in order that people may cultivate the
    land in peace, and serve a king so good and just as King Inge who
    has long had trouble and anxiety from the haughty unquiet spirit
    of his relations, although he has been a shield of defence for
    the whole people, and has been exposed to manifold perils for the
    peace of the country."  Erling spoke well and long, and many
    other chiefs also; and all to the same purpose -- all urging to
    battle.  In the meantime they waited until all the fleet should
    be assembled.  King Inge had the ship Baekisudin; and, at the
    entreaty of his friends, he did not join the battle, but lay
    still at the island.



    10. BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE.

    When the army was ready they rowed briskly against the enemy, and
    both sides raised a war-shout.  Inge's men did not bind their
    ships together, but let them be loose; for they rowed right
    across the current, by which the large ships were much swayed.
    Erling Skakke laid his ship beside King Hakon's ship, and ran the
    stem between his and Sigurd's ship, by which the battle began.
    But Gregorius's ship swung upon the ground, and heeled very much
    over, so that at first she could not come into the battle; and
    when Hakon's men saw this they laid themselves against her, and
    attacked Gregorius's ship on all sides.  Ivar, Hakon Mage's son,
    laid his ship so that the stems struck together; and he got a
    boat-hook fastened on Gregorius, on that part of his body where
    the waist is smallest, and dragged him to him, by which Gregorius
    stumbled against the ship's rails; but the hook slipped to one
    side, or Gregorius would have been dragged over-board. 
    Gregorius, however, was but little wounded, for he had on a plate
    coat of armour.  Ivar called out to him, that he had a "thick
    bark."  Gregorius replied, that if Ivar went on so he would
    "require it all, and not have too much."  It was very near then
    that Gregorius and his men had sprung overboard; but Aslak Unge
    threw an anchor into their ship, and dragged them off the ground.
    Then Gregorius laid himself against Ivar's ship, and they fought
    a long while; but Gregorius's ship being both higher sided and
    more strongly manned, many people fell in Ivar's ship, and some
    jumped overboard.  Ivar was so severely wounded that he could not
    take part in the fight.  When his ship was cleared of the men,
    Gregorius let Ivar be carried to the shore, so that he might
    escape; and from that time they were constant friends.



    11. KING HAKON'S FLIGHT.

    When King Inge and his men saw that Gregorius was aground, he
    encouraged his crew to row to his assistance.  "It was," he said,
    "the most imprudent advice that we should remain lying here,
    while our friends are in battle; for we have the largest and best
    ship in all the fleet.  But now I see that Gregorius, the man to
    whom I owe the most, is in need of help; so we must hasten to the
    fight where it is sharpest.  It is also most proper that I should
    be in the battle; for the victory, if we win it, will belong to
    me.  And if I even knew beforehand that our men were not to gain
    the battle, yet our place is where our friends are; for I can do
    nothing if I lose the men who are justly called the defence of
    the country, who are the bravest, and have long ruled for me and
    my kingdom."  Thereupon he ordered his banner to be set up, which
    was done; and they rowed across the river.  Then the battle
    raged, and the king could not get room to attack, so close lay
    the ships before him.  First he lay under the East-country
    trading ship, and from it they threw down upon his vessel spears,
    iron-shod stakes, and such large stones that it was impossible to
    hold out longer there, and he had to haul off.  Now when the
    king's people saw that he was come they made place for him, and
    then he laid alongside of Eindride Jonson's ship.  Now King
    Hakon's men abandoned the small ships, and went on board the
    large merchant vessels; but some of them sprang on shore.  Erling
    Skakke and his men had a severe conflict.  Erling himself was on
    the forecastle, and called his forecastlemen, and ordered them to
    board the king's ship; but they answered, this was no easy
    matter, for there were beams above with an iron comb on them.
    Then Erling himself went to the bow, and stayed there a while,
    until they succeeded in getting on board the king's ship: and
    then the ship was cleared of men on the bows, and the whole army
    gave way.  Many sprang into the water, many fell, but the greater
    number got to the land.  So says Einar Skulason: --

         "Men fall upon the slippery deck --
         Men roll off from the blood-drenched wreck;
         Dead bodies float down with the stream,
         And from the shores witch-ravens scream.
         The cold blue river now runs red
         With the warm blood of warriors dead,
         And stains the waves in Karmt Sound
         With the last drops of the death-wound.

         "All down the stream, with unmann'd prow,
         Floats many an empty long-ship now,
         Ship after ship, shout after shout,
         Tell that Kign Hakon can't hold out.
         The bowmen ply their bows of elm,
         The red swords flash o'er broken helm:
         King Hakon's men rush to the strand,
         Out of their ships, up through the land."

    Einar composed a song about Gregorius Dagson, which is called the
    River-song.  King Inge granted life and peace to Nikolas
    Skialdvarson when his ship was deserted, and thereupon he went
    into King Inge's service, and remained in it as long as the king
    lived.  Eindride Jonson leaped on board of King Inge's ship when
    his own was cleared of men, and begged for his life.  King Inge
    wished to grant it; but Havard Klining's son ran up, and gave him
    a mortal wound, which was much blamed; but he said Eindride had
    been the cause of his father's death.  There was much lamentation
    at Eindride's death, but principally in the Throndhjem district.
    Many of Hakon's people fell here, but not many chiefs.  Few of
    King Inge's people fell, but many were wounded.  King Hakon fled
    up the country, and King Inge went north to Viken with his
    troops; and he, as well as Gregorius, remained in Viken all
    winter (A.D. 1160).  When King Inge's men, Bergliot and his
    brothers, sons of Ivar of Elda, came from the battle to Bergen,
    they slew Nickolas Skeg, who had been Hakon's treasurer, and then
    went north to Throndhjem.

    King Hakon came north before Yule, and Sigurd was sometimes home
    at Reyr; for Gregorius, who was nearly related to Sigurd, had
    obtained for him life and safety from King Inge, so that he
    retained all his estates.  King Hakon was in the merchant-town of
    Nidaros in Yule; and one evening in the beginning of Yule his men
    fought in the room of the court, and in this affray eight men
    were killed, and many were wounded.  The eighth day of Yule, King
    Hakon's man Alf Rode, son of Ottar Birting, with about eighty
    men, went to Elda, and came in the night unexpectedly on the
    people, who were very drunk, and set fire to the room; but they
    went out, and defended themselves bravely.  There fell Bergliot,
    Ivar's son, and Ogmund, his brother, and many more.  They had
    been nearly thirty altogether in number.  In winter died, north
    in the merchant-town, Andres Simonson, King Hakon's foster-
    brother; and his death was much deplored.  Erling Skakke and
    Inge's men, who were in Bergen, threatened that in winter they
    would proceed against Hakon and his men; but it came to nothing.
    Gregorius sent word from the east, from Konungahella, that if he
    were so near as Erling and his men, he would not sit quietly in
    Bergen while Hakon was killing King Inge's friends and their
    comrades in war north in the Throndhjem country.



    12. THE CONFLICT UPON THE PIERS.

    King Inge and Gregorius left the east in spring, and came to
    Bergen; but as soon as Hakon and Sigurd heard that Inge had left
    Viken, they went there by land.  When King Inge and his people
    came to Bergen, a quarrel arose between Haldor Brynjolfson and
    Bjorn Nikolason.  Bjorn's house-man asked Haldor's when they met
    at the pier, why he looked so pale.

    He replied, because he had been bled.

    "I could not look so pale if I tried, at merely being bled." 

    "I again think," retorted the other, "that thou wouldst have
    borne it worse, and less manfully."  And no other beginning was
    there for their quarrel than this.  Afterwards one word followed
    another, till from brawling they came to fighting.  It was told
    to Haldor Brynjolfson, who was in the house drinking, that his
    house-man was wounded down on the pier and he went there
    immediately.  But Bjorn's house-men had come there before, and as
    Haldor thought his house-man had been badly treated, he went up
    to them and beat them; and it was told to Bjorn Buk that the
    people of Viken were beating his house-men on the pier.  Then
    Bjorn and his house-men took their weapons, hurried down to the
    pier, and would avenge their men; and a bloody strife began.  It
    was told Gregorius that his relation Haldor required assistance,
    and that his house-men were being cut down in the street; on
    which Gregorius and his men ran to the place in their armour. 
    Now it was told Erling Skakke that his sister's son Bjorn was
    fighting with Gregorius and Haldor down on the piers, and that he
    needed help.  Then he proceeded thither with a great force, and
    exhorted the people to stand by him; saying it would be a great
    disgrace never to be wiped out, if the Viken people should
    trample upon them in their own native place.  There fell thirteen
    men, of whom nine were killed on the spot, and four died of their
    wounds, and many were wounded.  When the word came to King Inge
    that Gregorius and Erling were fighting down on the piers, he
    hastened there, and tried to separate them; but could do nothing,
    so mad were they on both sides.  Then Gregorius called to Inge,
    and told him to go away; for it was in vain to attempt coming
    between them, as matters now stood.  He said it would be the
    greatest misfortune if the king mixed himself up with it; for he
    could not be certain that there were not people in the fray who
    would commit some great misdeed if they had opportunity.  Then
    King Inge retired; and when the greatest tumult was over,
    Gregorius and his men went to Nikolas church, and Erling behind
    them, calling to each other.  Then King Inge came a second time,
    and pacified them; and both agreed that he should mediate between
    them.

    When King Inge and Gregorius heard that King Hakon was in Viken,
    they went east with many ships; but when they came King Hakon
    fled from them, and there was no battle.  Then King Inge went to
    Oslo, and Gregorius was in Konungahella.



    13. MUNAN'S DEATH.

    Soon after Gregorius heard that Hakon and his men were at a farm
    called Saurby, which lies up beside the forest.  Gregorius
    hastened there; came in the night; and supposing that King Hakon
    and Sigurd would be in the largest of the houses, set fire to the
    buildings there.  But Hakon and his men were in the smaller
    house, and came forth, seeing the fire, to help their people.
    There Munan fell, a son of Ale Uskeynd, a brother of King Sigurd
    Hakon's father.  Gregorius and his men killed him, because he was
    helping those whom they were burning within the house.  Some
    escaped, but many were killed.  Asbjorn Jalda, who had been a
    very great viking, escaped from the house, but was grievously
    wounded.  A bonde met him, and he offered the man money to let
    him get away; but the bonde replied, he would do what he liked
    best; and, adding that he had often been in fear of his life for
    him, he slew him.  King Hakon and Sigurd escaped, but many of
    their people were killed.  Thereafter Gregorius returned home to
    Konungahella.  Soon after King Hakon and Sigurd went to Haldor
    Brynjolfson's farm of Vettaland, set fire to the house, and burnt
    it.  Haldor went out, and was cut down instantly with his house-
    men; and in all there were about twenty men killed.  Sigrid,
    Haldor's wife, was a sister of Gregorius, and they allowed her to
    escape into the forest in her night-shift only; but they took
    with them Amunde, who was a son of Gyrd Amundason and of Gyrid
    Dag's daughter, and a sister's son of Gregorius, and who was then
    a boy about five years old.



    14. OF THE FALL OF GREGORIUS DAGSON.

    When Gregorius heard the news he took it much to heart, and
    inquired carefully where they were.  Gregorius set out from
    Konungahella late in Yule, and came to Fors the thirteenth day of
    Yule, where he remained a night, and heard vespers the last day
    of Yule, which was a Saturday, and the holy Evangel was read
    before him.  When Gregorius and his followers saw the men of King
    Hakon and Sigurd, the king's force appeared to them smaller than
    their own.  There was a river called Befia between them, where
    they met; and there was unsound ice on the river, for there went
    a stream under the ice from it.  King Hakon and his men had cut a
    rent in the ice, and laid snow over it, so that nobody could see
    it.  When Gregorius came to the ice on the river the ice appeared
    to him unsound, he said; and he advised the people to go to the
    bridge, which was close by, to cross the river.  The bonde-troops
    replied, that they did not know why he should be afraid to go
    across the ice to attack so few people as Hakon had, and the ice
    was good enough.  Gregorius said it was seldom necessary to
    encourage him to show bravery, and it should not be so now.  Then
    he ordered them to follow him, and not to be standing on the land
    while he was on the ice, and he said it was their council to go
    out upon the dangerous ice, but he had no wish to do so, or to be
    led by them.  Then he ordered the banner to be advanced, and
    immediately went out on the ice with the men.  As soon as the
    bondes found that the ice was unsound they turned back. 
    Gregorius fell through the ice, but not very deep, and he told
    his men to take care.  There were not more than twenty men with
    him, the others having turned back.  A man of King Hakon's troop
    shot an arrow at Gregorius, which hit him under the throat, and
    thus ended his life.  Gregorius fell, and ten men with him.  It
    is the talk of all men that he had been the most gallant
    lenderman in Norway that any man then living could remember; and
    also he behaved the best towards us Icelanders of any chief since
    King Eystein the Elder's death.  Gregorius's body was carried to
    Hofund, and interred at Gimsey Isle, in a nunnery which is there,
    of which Gregorius's sister, Baugeid, was then the abbess.



    15. KING INGE HEARS OF GREGORIUS'S FALL.

    Two bailiffs went to Oslo to bring the tidings to King Inge. 
    When they arrived they desired to speak to the king: and he
    asked, what news they brought.

    "Gregorius Dagson's death," said they.

    "How came that misfortune?" asked the king.

    When they had told him how it happened, he said, "They gave
    advice who understood the least."

    It is said he took it so much to heart that he cried like a
    child.  When he recovered himself he said, "I wanted to go to
    Gregorius as soon as I heard of Haldor's murder; for I thought
    that Gregorius would not sit long before thinking. of revenge.
    But the people here would think nothing so important as their
    Yule feasts, and nothing could move them away; and I am confident
    that if I had been there, he would either have proceeded more
    cautiously, or I and Gregorius would now have shared one lodging.
    Now he is gone, the man who has been my best friend, and more
    than any other has kept the kingdom in my hands; and I think it
    will be but a short space between us.  Now I make an oath to go
    forth against Hakon, and one of two things shall happen: I shall
    either come to my death, or shall walk over Hakon and his people;
    and such a man as Gregorius is not avenged, even if all were to
    pay the penalty of their lives for him."

    There was a man present who replied, "Ye need not seek after
    them, for they intend to seek you."

    Kristin, King Sigurd's daughter and King Inge's cousin, was then
    in Oslo.  The king heard that she intended going away.  He sent a
    message to her to inquire why she wished to leave the town.

    She thought it was dangerous and unsafe for a female to be there. 
    The king would not let her go. "For if it go well with me, as I
    hope, you will be well here; and if I fall, my friends may not
    get leave to dress my body; but you can ask permission, and it
    will not be denied you, and you will thereby best requite what I
    have done for you."



    16. OF KING INGE.

    On Saint Blasius' day (February 3, 1161), in the evening, King
    Inge's spies brought him the news that King Hakon was coming
    towards the town.  Then King Inge ordered the war-horns to call
    together all the troops up from the town; and when he drew them
    up he could reckon them to be nearly 4000 men.  The king let the
    array be long, but not more than five men deep.  Then some said
    that the king should not be himself in the battle, as they
    thought the risk too great; but that his brother Orm should be
    the leader of the army.  The king replied, "I think if Gregorius
    were alive and here now, and I had fallen and was to be avenged,
    he would not lie concealed, but would be in the battle.  Now,
    although I, on account of my ill health, am not fit for the
    combat as he was, yet will I show as good will as he would have
    had; and it is not to be thought of that I should not be in the
    battle."

    People say that Gunhild, who was married to Simon, King Hakon's
    foster-brother, had a witch employed to sit out all night and
    procure the victory for Hakon; and that the answer was obtained,
    that they should fight King Inge by night, and never by day, and
    then the result would be favourable.  The witch who, as people
    say, sat out was called Thordis Skeggia; but what truth there may
    be in the report I know not.

    Simon Skalp had gone to the town, and was gone to sleep, when the
    war-shouts awoke him.  When the night was well advanced, King
    Inge's spies came to him, and told him that King Hakon and his
    army were coming over the ice; for the ice lay the whole way from
    the town to Hofud Isle.



    17. KING INGE'S SPEECH.

    Thereupon King Inge went with his army out on the ice, and he
    drew it up in order of battle in front of the town.  Simon Skalp
    was in that wing of the array which was towards Thraelaberg; and
    on the other wing, which was towards the Nunnery, was Gudrod, the
    king of the South Hebudes, a son of Olaf Klining, and Jon, a son
    of Svein Bergthor Buk.  When King Hakon and his army came near to
    King Inge's array, both sides raised a war-shout.  Gudrod and Jon
    gave King Hakon and his men a sign, and let them know where they
    were in the line; and as soon as Hakon's men in consequence
    turned thither, Gudrod immediately fled with 1500 men; and Jon,
    and a great body of men with him, ran over to King Hakon's army,
    and assisted them in the fight.  When this news was told to King
    Inge, he said, "Such is the difference between my friends.  Never
    would Gregorius have done so in his life!"  There were some who
    advised King Inge to get on horseback, and ride from the battle
    up to Raumarike; "where," said they, "you would get help enough,
    even this very day."  The king replied, he had no inclination to
    do so.  "I have heard you often say, and I think truly, that it
    was of little use to my brother, King Eystein, that he took to
    flight; and yet he was a man distinguished for many qualities
    which adorn a king.  Now I, who labour under so great
    decrepitude, can see how bad my fate would be, if I betook myself
    to what proved so unfortunate for him; with so great a difference
    as there is between our activity, health, and strength.  I was in
    the second year of my age when I was chosen king of Norway, and I
    am now twenty-five; and I think I have had misfortune and sorrow
    under my kingly dignity, rather than pleasure and peaceful days.
    I have had many battles, sometimes with more, sometimes with
    fewer people; and it is my greatest luck that I have never fled.
    God will dispose of my life, and of how long it shall be; but I
    shall never betake myself to flight."



    18. KING INGE'S FALL.

    Now as Jon and his troop had broken the one wing of King Inge's
    array, many of those who were nearest to him fled, by which the
    whole array was dispersed, and fell into disorder.  But Hakon and
    his men went briskly forwards; and now it was near daybreak.  An
    assault was made against King Inge's banner, and in this conflict
    King Inge fell; but his brother Orm continued the battle, while
    many of the army fled up into the town.  Twice Orm went to the
    town after the king's fall to encourage the people, and both
    times returned, and went out again upon the ice to continue the
    battle.  Hakon's men attacked the wing of the array which Simon
    Skalp led; and in that assault fell of King Inge's men his
    brother-in-law, Gudbrand Skafhogson.  Simon Skalp and Halvard
    Hikre went against each other with their troops, and fought while
    they drew aside past Thraelaberg; and in this conflict both Simon
    and Halvard fell.  Orm, the king's brother, gained great
    reputation in this battle; but he at last fled.  Orm the winter
    before had been contracted with Ragna, a daughter of Nikolas
    Mase, who had been married before to King Eystein Haraldson; and
    the wedding was fixed for the Sunday after Saint Blasius's mass,
    which was on a Friday.  Orm fled east to Svithjod, where his
    brother Magnus was then king; and their brother Ragnvald was an
    earl there at that time.  They were the sons of Queen Ingerid and
    Henrik Halte, who was a son of the Danish king Svein Sveinson.
    The princess Kristin took care of King Inge's body, which was
    laid on the stone wall of Halvard's church, on the south side
    without the choir.  He had then been king for twenty-three years
    (A.D. 1137-1161).  In this battle many fell on both sides, but
    principally of King Inge's men.  Of King Hakon's people fell Arne
    Frirekson.  Hakon's men took all the feast and victuals prepared
    for the wedding, and a great booty besides.



    19. OF KING HAKON AND QUEEN KRISTIN.

    Then King Hakon took possession of the whole country, and
    distributed all the offices among his own friends, both in the
    towns and in the country.  King Hakon and his men had a meeting
    in Halvard's church, where they had a private conference
    concerning the management of the country.  Kristin the princess
    gave the priest who kept the church keys a large sum of money to
    conceal one of her men in the church, so that she might know what
    Hakon and his counsellors intended.  When she learnt what they
    had said, she sent a man to Bergen to her husband Erling Skakke,
    with the message that he should never trust Hakon or his men.



    20. OF OLAF'S MIRACLE.

    It happened at the battle of Stiklestad, as before related, that
    King Olaf threw from him the sword called Hneiter when he
    received his wound.  A Swedish man, who had broken his own sword,
    took it up, and fought with it.  When this man escaped with the
    other fugitives he came to Svithjod, and went home to his house.
    From that time he kept the sword all his days, and afterwards his
    son, and so relation after relation; and when the sword shifted
    its owner, the one told to the other the name of the sword and
    where it came from.  A long time after, in the days of Kirjalax
    the emperor of Constantinople, when there was a great body of
    Varings in the town, it happened in the summer that the emperor
    was on a campaign, and lay in the camp with his army.  The
    Varings who had the guard, and watched over the emperor, lay on
    the open plain without the camp.  They changed the watch with
    each other in the night, and those who had been before on watch
    lay down and slept; but all completely armed.  It was their
    custom, when they went to sleep, that each should have his helmet
    on his head, his shield over him, sword under the head, and the
    right hand on the sword-handle.  One of these comrades, whose lot
    it was to watch the latter part of the night, found, on awakening
    towards morning, that his sword was gone.  He looked after it,
    and saw it lying on the flat plain at a distance from him.  He
    got up and took the sword, thinking that his comrades who had
    been on watch had taken the sword from him in a joke; but they
    all denied it.  The same thing happened three nights.  Then he
    wondered at it, as well as they who saw or heard of it; and
    people began to ask him how it could have happened.  He said that
    his sword was called Hneiter, and had belonged to King Olaf the
    Saint, who had himself carried it in the battle of Stiklestad;
    and he also related how the sword since that time had gone from
    one to another.  This was told to the emperor, who called the man
    before him to whom the sword belonged, and gave him three times
    as much gold as the sword was worth; and the sword itself he had
    laid in Saint Olaf's church, which the Varings supported, where
    it has been ever since over the altar.  There was a lenderman of
    Norway while Harald Gille's sons, Eystein, Inge, and Sigurd
    lived, who was called Eindride Unge; and he was in Constantinople
    when these events took place.  He told these circumstances in
    Norway, according to what Einar Skulason says in his song about
    King Olaf the Saint, in which these events are sung.



    21. OLAF'S MIRACLE IN FAVOUR OF THE VARINGS.

    It happened once in the Greek country, when Kirjalax was emperor
    there, that he made an expedition against Blokumannaland.  When
    he came to the Pezina plains, a heathen king came against him
    with an innumerable host.  He brought with him many horsemen, and
    many large waggons, in which were large loop-holes for shooting
    through.  When they prepared for their night quarters they drew
    up their waggons, one by the side of the other, without their
    tents, and dug a great ditch without; and all which made a
    defence as strong as a castle.  The heathen king was blind.  Now
    when the Greek king came, the heathens drew up their array on the
    plains before their waggon-fortification.  The Greeks drew up
    their array opposite, and they rode on both sides to fight with
    each other; but it went on so ill and so unfortunately, that the
    Greeks were compelled to fly after suffering a great defeat, and
    the heathens gained a victory.  Then the king drew up an array of
    Franks and Flemings, who rode against the heathens, and fought
    with them; but it went with them as with the others, that many
    were killed, and all who escaped took to flight.  Then the Greek
    king was greatly incensed at his men-at-arms; and they replied,
    that he should now take his wine-bags, the Varings.  The king
    says that he would not throw away his jewels, and allow so few
    men, however bold they might be, to attack so vast an army.  Then
    Thorer Helsifig, who at that time was leader of the Varings
    replied to the king's words, "If there was burning fire in the
    way, I and my people would run into it, if I knew the king's
    advantage required it."  Then the king replied, "Call upon your
    holy King Olaf for help and strength."  The Varings, who were 450
    men, made a vow with hand and word to build a church in
    Constantinople, at their own expense and with the aid of other
    good men, and have the church consecrated to the honour and glory
    of the holy King Olaf; and thereupon the Varings rushed into the
    plain.  When the heathens saw them, they told their king that
    there was another troop of the Greek king's army come out upon
    the plain; but they were only a handful of people.  The king
    says, "Who is that venerable man riding on a white horse at the
    head of the troop?"  They replied, "We do not see him."  There
    was so great a difference of numbers, that there were sixty
    heathens for every Christian man; but notwithstanding the Varings
    went boldly to the attack.  As soon as they met terror and alarm
    seized the army of the heathens, and they instantly began to fly;
    but the Varings pursued, and soon killed a great number of them.
    When the Greeks and Franks who before had fled from the heathens
    saw this, they hastened to take part, and pursue the enemy with
    the others.  Then the Varings had reached the waggon-
    fortification, where the greatest defeat was given to the enemy.
    The heathen king was taken in the flight of his people, and the
    Varings brought him along with them; after which the Christians
    took the camp of the heathens, and their waggon-fortification.
