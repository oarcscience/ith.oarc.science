# The Danish History, Introduction Part II

WAR.

"Weapons". -- The sword is the weapon par excellence in Saxo's
narrative, and he names several by name, famous old blades like our
royal Curtana, which some believed was once Tristrem's, and that sword
of Carlus, whose fortunes are recorded in Irish annals. Such are
"Snyrtir", Bearce's sword; "Hothing", Agnar's blade; "Lauf", or "Leaf",
Bearce's sword; "Screp", Wermund's sword, long buried and much
rust-eaten, but sharp and trusty, and known by its whistle; Miming's
sword ("Mistletoe"), which slew Balder. Wainhead's curved blade seems to
be a halbert; "Lyusing" and "Hwiting", Ragnald of Norway's swords;
"Logthe", the sword of Ole Siward's son.

The "war-club" occurs pretty frequently. But it is usually introduced as
a special weapon of a special hero, who fashions a gold-headed club to
slay one that steel cannot touch, or who tears up a tree, like the
Spanish knight in the ballad, or who uses a club to counteract spells
that blunt steel. The bat- shapen archaic rudder of a ship is used as a
club in the story of the Sons of Arngrim.

The "spear" plays no particular part in Saxo: even Woden's spear Gungne
is not prominent.

"Bows and arrows" are not often spoken of, but archer heroes, such as
Toki, Ane Bow-swayer, and Orwar-Odd, are known. Slings and stones are
used.

The shield, of all defensive armour, is far the most prominent. They
were often painted with devices, such as Hamlet's shield, Hildiger's
Swedish shield. Dr. Vigfusson has shown the importance of these painted
shields in the poetic history of the Scandinavians.

A red shield is a signal of peace. Shields are set round ramparts on
land as round ships at sea.

"Mail-coats" are worn. Frode has one charmed against steel. Hother has
another; a mail-coat of proof is mentioned and their iron meshes are
spoken of.

"Helmets" are used, but not so carefully described as in "Beowulf's
Lay"; crested helmets and a gilded helmet occur in Bearca-mal and in
another poem.

"Banners" serve as rallying points in the battle and on the march. The
Huns' banners are spoken of in the classic passage for the description
of a huge host invading a country. Bearca- mal talks of golden banners.

"Horns" (1) were blown pp at the beginning of the engagement and for
signalling. The gathering of the host was made by delivery of a wooden
arrow painted to look like iron.

"Tactics". -- The hand-to-hand fight of the wager of battle with sword
and shield, and the fighting in ranks and the wedge-column at close
quarters, show that the close infantry combat was the main event of the
battle. The preliminary hurling of stones, and shooting of arrows, and
slinging of pebbles, were harassing and annoying, but seldom
sufficiently important to affect the result of the main engagement.

Men ride to battle, but fight on foot; occasionally an aged king is
car-borne to the fray, and once the car, whether by Saxo's adorning
hand, or by tradition, is scythe-armed.

The gathered host is numbered, once, where, as with Xerxes, counting was
too difficult, by making each man as he passed put a pebble in a pile
(which piles survive to mark the huge size of Frode's army). This is, of
course, a folktale, explaining the pebble-hills and illustrating the
belief in Frode's power; but armies were mustered by such expedients of
old. Burton tells of an African army each man of whom presented an egg,
as a token of his presence and a means of taking the number of the host.

We hear of men marching in light order without even scabbards, and
getting over the ice in socks.

The war equipment and habits of the Irish, light armoured, clipped at
back of head, hurling the javelin backwards in their feigned flight; of
the Slavs, small blue targets and long swords; of the Finns, with their
darts and skees, are given.

Watches are kept, and it is noted that "uht", the early watch after
midnight, is the worst to be attacked in (the duke's two-
o'clock-in-the-morning courage being needed, and the darkness and cold
helping the enemy).

Spies were, of course, slain if discovered. But we have instances of
kings and heroes getting into foeman's camps in disguise (cf. stories of
Alfred and Anlaf).

The order of battle of Bravalla fight is given, and the ideal array of a
host. To Woden is ascribed the device of the boar's head, hamalt fylking
(the swine-head array of Manu's Indian kings), the terrible column with
wedge head which could cleave the stoutest line.

The host of Ring has men from Wener, Wermland, Gotaelf, Thotn, Wick,
Thelemark, Throndham, Sogn, Firths, Fialer, Iceland; Sweden, Gislamark,
Sigtun, Upsala, Pannonia.

The host of Harold had men from Iceland, the Danish provinces, Frisia,
Lifland; Slavs, and men from Jom, Aland, and Sleswick.

The battle of Bravalla is said to have been won by the Gotland archers
and the men of Throndham, and the Dales. The death of Harald by
treachery completed the defeat, which began when Ubbe fell (after he had
broken the enemy's van) riddled with arrows.

The defeated, unless they could fly, got little quarter. One- fifth only
of the population of a province are said to have survived an invasion.
After sea-battles (always necessarily more deadly) the corpses choke the
harbours. Seventy sea-kings are swept away in one sea-fight. Heads seem
to have been taken in some cases, but not as a regular Teutonic usage,
and the practice, from its being attributed to ghosts and aliens, must
have already been considered savage by Saxo, and probably by his
informants and authorities.

Prisoners were slaves; they might be killed, put to cruel death,
outraged, used as slaves, but the feeling in favour of mercy was
growing, and the cruelty of Eormenric, who used tortures to his
prisoners, of Rothe, who stripped his captives, and of Fro, who sent
captive ladies to a brothel in insult, is regarded with dislike.

Wounds were looked on as honourable, but they must be in front or
honourably got. A man who was shot through the buttocks, or wounded in
the back, was laughed at and disgraced. We hear of a mother helping her
wounded son out of battle.

That much of human interest centered round war is evident by the mass of
tradition that surrounds the subject in Saxo, both in its public and
private aspects. Quaint is the analysis of the four kinds of warriors:
(a) The Veterans, or Doughty, who kill foes and spare flyers; (b) the
Young men who kill foes and flyers too; (c) the well-to-do, landed, and
propertied men of the main levy, who neither fight for fear nor fly for
shame; (d) the worthless, last to fight and first to fly; and curious
are the remarks about married and unmarried troops, a matter which Chaka
pondered over in later days. Homeric speeches precede the fight.

"Stratagems of War" greatly interested Saxo (probably because Valerius
Maximus, one of his most esteemed models, was much occupied with such
matters), so that he diligently records the military traditions of the
notably skillful expedients of famous commanders of old.

There is the device for taking a town by means of the "pretended death"
of the besieging general, a device ascribed to Hastings and many more
commanders (see Steenstrup Normannerne); the plan of "firing" a besieged
town by fire-bearing birds, ascribed here to Fridlev, in the case of
Dublin to Hadding against Duna (where it was foiled by all tame birds
being chased out of the place).

There is the "Birnam Wood" stratagem, by which men advanced behind a
screen of boughs, which is even used for the concealment of ships, and
the curious legend (occurring in Irish tradition also, and recalling
Capt. B. Hall's "quaker gun" story) by which a commander bluffs off his
enemy by binding his dead to stakes in rows, as if they were living men.

Less easy to understand are the "brazen horses" or "machines" driven
into the close lines of the enemy to crush and open them, an invention
of Gewar. The use of hooked weapons to pull down the foes' shields and
helmets was also taught to Hother by Gewar.

The use of black tents to conceal encampment; the defence of a pass by
hurling rocks from the heights; the bridge of boats across the Elbe; and
the employment of spies, and the bold venture, ascribed in our
chronicles to Alfred and Anlaf, of visiting in disguise the enemy's
camp, is here attributed to Frode, who even assumed women's clothes for
the purpose.

Frode is throughout the typical general, as he is the typical statesman
and law-giver of archaic Denmark.

There are certain heathen usages connected with war, as the hurling of a
javelin or shooting of an arrow over the enemy's ranks as a "sacratio"
to Woden of the foe at the beginning of a battle. This is recorded in
the older vernacular authorities also, in exact accordance with the
Homeric usage, "Odyssey" xxiv, 516-595.

The dedication of part of the spoils to the god who gave good omens for
the war is told of the heathen Baltic peoples; but though, as Sidonius
records, it had once prevailed among the Saxons, and, as other witnesses
add, among the Scandinavian people, the tradition is not clearly
preserved by Saxo.

"Sea and Sea Warfare." -- As might be expected, there is much mention of
Wicking adventure and of maritime warfare in Saxo.

Saxo tells of Asmund's huge ship (Gnod), built high that he might shoot
down on the enemy's craft; he speaks of a ship (such as Godwin gave as a
gift to the king his master), and the monk of St. Bertin and the
court-poets have lovingly described a ship with gold-broidered sails,
gilt masts, and red-dyed rigging. One of his ships has, like the ships
in the Chansons de Geste, a carbuncle for a lantern at the masthead.
Hedin signals to Frode by a shield at the masthead. A red shield was a
peace signal, as noted above. The practice of "strand-hewing", a great
feature in Wicking-life (which, so far as the victualling of raw meat by
the fishing fleets, and its use raw, as Mr. P. H. Emerson informs me,
still survives), is spoken of. There was great fear of monsters
attacking them, a fear probably justified by such occasional attacks of
angry whales as Melville (founding his narrative on repeated facts) has
immortalised. The whales, like Moby Dick, were uncanny, and inspired by
troll-women or witches (cf. "Frithiof Saga" and the older "Lay of Atle
and Rimegerd"). The clever sailing of Hadding, by which he eludes
pursuit, is tantalising, for one gathers that, Saxo knows the details
that he for some reason omits. Big fleets of 150 and a monster armada of
3,000 vessels are recorded.

The ships were moved by oars and sails; they had rudders, no doubt such
as the Gokstad ship, for the hero Arrow-Odd used a rudder as a weapon.

"Champions". -- Professed fighting men were often kept by kings and
earls about their court as useful in feud and fray. Harald Fairhair's
champions are admirably described in the contemporary Raven Song by
Hornclofe --

         "Wolf-coats they call them that in battle
         Bellow into bloody shields.
         They wear wolves' hides when they come into the fight,
         And clash their weapons together."

and Saxo's sources adhere closely to this pattern.

These "bear-sarks", or wolf-coats of Harald give rise to an O. N. term,
"bear-sarks' way", to describe the frenzy of fight and fury which such
champions indulged in, barking and howling, and biting their shield-rims
(like the ferocious "rook" in the narwhale ivory chessmen in the British
Museum) till a kind of state was produced akin to that of the Malay when
he has worked himself up to "run-a-muck." There seems to have been in
the 10th century a number of such fellows about unemployed, who became
nuisances to their neighbours by reason of their bullying and
highhandedness. Stories are told in the Icelandic sagas of the way such
persons were entrapped and put to death by the chiefs they served when
they became too troublesome. A favourite (and fictitious) episode in an
"edited" Icelandic saga is for the hero to rescue a lady promised to
such a champion (who has bullied her father into consent) by slaying the
ruffian. It is the same "motif" as Guy of Warwick and the Saracen lady,
and one of the regular Giant and Knight stories.

Beside men-warriors there were "women-warriors" in the North, as Saxo
explains. He describes shield-maidens, as Alfhild, Sela, Rusila (the
Ingean Ruadh, or Red Maid of the Irish Annals, as Steenstrup so
ingeniously conjectures); and the three she- captains, Wigbiorg, who
fell on the field, Hetha, who was made queen of Zealand, and Wisna,
whose hand Starcad cut off, all three fighting manfully at Bravalla
fight.

SOCIAL LIFE AND MANNERS.

"Feasts". -- The hall-dinner was an important feature in the old
Teutonic court-life. Many a fine scene in a saga takes place in the hall
while the king and his men are sitting over their ale. The hall decked
with hangings, with its fires, lights, plate and provisions, appears in
Saxo just as in the Eddic Lays, especially Rigsmal, and the Lives of the
Norwegian Kings and Orkney Earls.

The order of seats is a great point of archaic manners. Behaviour at
table was a matter of careful observance. The service, especially that
of the cup-bearer, was minutely regulated by etiquette. An honoured
guest was welcomed by the host rising to receive him and giving him a
seat near himself, but less distinguished visitors were often victims to
the rough horseplay of the baser sort, and of the wanton young gentleman
at court. The food was simple, boiled beef and pork, and mutton without
sauce, ale served in horns from the butt. Roast meat, game, sauces,
mead, and flagons set on the table, are looked on by Starcad as foreign
luxuries, and Germany was credited with luxurious cookery.

"Mimes and jugglers", who went through the country or were attached to
the lord's court to amuse the company, were a despised race because of
their ribaldry, obscenity, cowardice, and unabashed self-debasement; and
their newfangled dances and piping were loathsome to the old
court-poets, who accepted the harp alone as an instrument of music.

The story that once a king went to war with his jugglers and they ran
away, would represent the point of view of the old house- carle, who was
neglected, though "a first-class fighting man", for these debauched
foreign buffoons.

SUPERNATURAL BEINGS.

GODS AND GODDESSES. -- The gods spring, according to Saxo's belief, from
a race of sorcerers, some of whom rose to pre-eminence and expelled and
crushed the rest, ending the "wizard-age", as the wizards had ended the
monster or "giant-age". That they were identic with the classic gods he
is inclined to believe, but his difficulty is that in the week-days we
have Jove : Thor; Mercury : Woden; whereas it is perfectly well known
that Mercury is Jove's son, and also that Woden is the father of Thor --
a comic "embarras". That the persians the heathens worshipped as gods
existed, and that they were men and women false and powerful, Saxo
plainly believes. He has not Snorre's appreciation of the humorous side
of the mythology. He is ironic and scornful, but without the kindly,
naive fun of the Icelander.

The most active god, the Dane's chief god (as Frey is the Swede's god,
and patriarch), is "Woden". He appears in heroic life as patron of great
heroes and kings. Cf. "Hyndla-Lay", where it is said of Woden: --

         "Let us pray the Father of Hosts to be gracious to us!
         He granteth and giveth gold to his servants,
         He gave Heremod a helm and mail-coat,
         And Sigmund a sword to take.
         He giveth victory to his sons, to his followers wealth,
         Ready speech to his children and wisdom to men.
         Fair wind to captains, and song to poets;
         He giveth luck in love to many a hero."

He appears under various disguises and names, but usually as a one-eyed
old man, cowled and hooded; sometimes with another, bald and ragged, as
before the battle Hadding won; once as "Hroptr", a huge man skilled in
leechcraft, to Ragnar's son Sigfrid.

Often he is a helper in battle or doomer of feymen. As "Lysir", a rover
of the sea, he helps Hadding. As veteran slinger and archer he helps his
favourite Hadding; as charioteer, "Brune", he drives Harald to his death
in battle. He teaches Hadding how to array his troops. As "Yggr" the
prophet he advises the hero and the gods. As "Wecha" (Waer) the leech he
woos Wrinda. He invented the wedge array. He can grant charmed lives to
his favourites against steel. He prophesies their victories and death.
He snatches up one of his disciples, sets him on his magic horse that
rides over seas in the air, as in Skida-runa the god takes the beggar
over the North Sea. His image (like that of Frey in the Swedish story of
Ogmund dytt and Gunnar helming, "Flatey book", i, 335) could speak by
magic power.

Of his life and career Saxo gives several episodes.

Woden himself dwelt at Upsala and Byzantium (Asgard); and the northern
kings sent him a golden image ring-bedecked, which he made to speak
oracles. His wife Frigga stole the bracelets and played him false with a
servant, who advised her to destroy and rob the image.

When Woden was away (hiding the disgrace brought on him hy Frigga his
wife), an imposter, Mid Odin, possibly Loke in disguise, usurped his
place at Upsala, instituted special drink-offerings, fled to Finland on
Woden's return, and was slain by the Fins and laid in barrow. But the
barrow smote all that approached it with death, till the body was
unearthed, beheaded, and impaled, a well-known process for stopping the
haunting of an obnoxious or dangerous ghost.

Woden had a son Balder, rival of Hother for the love of Nanna, daughter
of King Gewar. Woden and Thor his son fought for him against Hother, but
in vain, for Hother won the laity and put Balder to shameful flight;
however, Balder, half-frenzied by his dreams of Nanna, in turn drove him
into exile (winning the lady); finally Hother, befriended hy luck and
the Wood Maidens, to whom he owed his early successes and his magic
coat, belt, and girdle (there is obvious confusion here in the text), at
last met Balder and stabbed him in the side. Of this wound Balder died
in three days, as was foretold by the awful dream in which Proserpina
(Hela) appeared to him. Balder's grand burial, his barrow, and the magic
flood which burst from it when one Harald tried to break into it, and
terrified the robbers, are described.

The death of Balder led Woden to seek revenge. Hrossthiof the wizard,
whom he consulted, told him he must beget a son by "Wrinda" (Rinda,
daughter of the King of the Ruthenians), who should avenge his
half-brother.

Woden's wooing is the best part of this story, half spoilt, however, by
euhemeristic tone and lack of epic dignity. He woos as a victorious
warrior, and receives a cuff; as a generous goldsmith, and gets a
buffet; as a handsome soldier, earning a heavy knock-down blow; but in
the garb of a women as Wecha (Wakr), skilled in leechcraft, he won his
way by trickery; and ("Wale") "Bous" was born, who, after some years,
slew Hother in battle, and died himself of his wounds. Bous' barrow in
Bohusland, Balder's haven, Balder's well, are named as local
attestations of the legend, which is in a late form, as it seems.

The story of Woden's being banished for misbehaviour, and especially for
sorcery and for having worn woman's attire to trick Wrinda, his
replacement by "Wuldor" ("Oller"), a high priest who assumed Woden's
name and flourished for ten years, but was ultimately expelled by the
returning Woden, and killed by the Danes in Sweden, is in the same
style. But Wuldor's bone vessel is an old bit of genuine tradition
mangled. It would cross the sea as well as a ship could, by virtue of
certain spells marked on it.

Of "Frey", who appears as "satrapa" of the gods at Upsala, and as the
originator of human sacrifice, and as appeased by black victims, at a
sacrifice called Froblod (Freys-blot) instituted by Hadding, who began
it as an atonement for having slain a sea-monster, a deed for which he
had incurred a curse. The priapic and generative influences of Frey are
only indicated by a curious tradition mentioned. It almost looks as if
there had once been such an institution at Upsala as adorned the
Phoenician temples, under Frey's patronage and for a symbolic means of
worship.

"Thunder", or "Thor", is Woden's son, strongest of gods or men, patron
of Starcad, whom he turned, by pulling off four arms, from a monster to
a man.

He fights by Woden's side and Balder's against Hother, by whose magic
wand his club (hammer) was lopped off part of its shaft, a wholly
different and, a much later version than the one Snorre gives in the
prose Edda. Saxo knows of Thor's journey to the haunt of giant Garfred
(Geirrod) and his three daughters, and of the hurling of the iron
"bloom", and of the crushing of the giantesses, though he does not seem
to have known of the river- feats of either the ladies or Thor, if we
may judge (never a safe thing wholly) by his silence.

Whether "Tew" is meant by the Mars of the Song of the Voice is not
evident. Saxo may only be imitating the repeated catch-word "war" of the
original.

"Loke" appears as Utgard-Loke, Loke of the skirts of the World, as it
were; is treated as a venomous giant bound in agony under a
serpent-haunted cavern (no mention is made of "Sigyn" or her pious
ministry).

"Hela" seems to be meant by Saxo's Proserpina.

"Nanna" is the daughter of Gewar, and Balder sees her bathing and falls
in love with her, as madly as Frey with Gertha in Skirnismal.

"Freya", the mistress of Od, the patroness of Othere the homely, the
sister of Frey-Frode, and daughter of Niord-Fridlaf, appears as Gunwara
Eric's love and Syritha Ottar's love and the hair- clogged maiden, as
Dr. Rydberg has shown.

The gods can disguise their form, change their shape, are often met in a
mist, which shrouds them save from the right person; they appear and
disappear at will. For the rest they have the mental and physical
characteristics of the kings and queens they protect or persecute so
capriciously. They can be seen by making a magic sign and looking
through a witch's arm held akimbo. They are no good comates for men or
women, and to meddle with a goddess or nymph or giantess was to ensure
evil or death for a man. The god's loves were apparently not always so
fatal, though there seems to be some tradition to that effect. Most of
the god-sprung heroes are motherless or unborn (i.e., born like Macduff
by the Caesarean operation) -- Sigfred, in the Eddic Lays for instance.

Besides the gods, possibly older than they are, and presumably mightier,
are the "Fates" (Norns), three Ladies who are met with together, who
fulfil the parts of the gift-fairies of our Sleeping Beauty tales, and
bestow endowments on the new-born child, as in the beautiful "Helge
Lay", a point of the story which survives in Ogier of the Chansons de
Geste, wherein Eadgar (Otkerus or Otgerus) gets what belonged to Holger
(Holge), the Helga of "Beowulf's Lay". The caprices of the Fates, where
one corrects or spoils the others' endowments, are seen in Saxo, when
beauty, bounty, and meanness are given together. They sometimes meet
heroes, as they met Helgi in the Eddic Lay (Helgi and Sigrun Lay), and
help or begift them; they prepare the magic broth for Balder, are
charmed with Hother's lute-playing, and bestow on him a belt of victory
and a girdle of splendour, and prophesy things to come.

The verse in Biarca-mal, where "Pluto weaves the dooms of the mighty and
fills Phlegethon with noble shapes," recalls Darrada-liod, and points to
Woden as death-doomer of the warrior.

"Giants". -- These are stupid, mischievous, evil and cunning in Saxo's
eyes. Oldest of beings, with chaotic force and exuberance, monstrous in
extravagant vitality.

The giant nature of the older troll-kind is abhorrent to man and woman.
But a giantess is enamoured of a youth she had fostered, and giants
carry off king's daughters, and a three-bodied giant captures young
children.

Giants live in caves by the sea, where they keep their treasure. One
giant, Unfoot (Ofoti), is a shepherd, like Polyphemus, and has a famous
dog which passed into the charge of Biorn, and won a battle; a giantess
is keeping goats in the wilds. A giant's fury is so great that it takes
twelve champions to control him, when the rage is on him. The troll
(like our Puss-in-Boots Ogre) can take any shape.

Monstrous apparitions are mentioned, a giant hand (like that in one
story of Finn) searching for its prey among the inmates of a booth in
the wilds. But this Grendel-like arm is torn off by a giantess,
Hardgrip, daughter of Wainhead and niece possibly of Hafle.

The voice heard at night prophesying is that of some god or monster,
possibly Woden himself.

"Dwarves". -- These Saxo calls Satyrs, and but rarely mentions. The
dwarf Miming, who lives in the desert, has a precious sword of sharpness
(Mistletoe?) that could even pierce skin-hard Balder, and a ring
(Draupnir) that multiplied itself for its possessor. He is trapped by
the hero and robbed of his treasures.

FUNERAL RITES AND MAN'S FUTURE STATE.

"Barrow-burials". -- The obsequies of great men (such as the classic
funeral of "Beowulf's Lay", 3138-80) are much noticed by Saxo, and we
might expect that he knew such a poem (one similar to Ynglingatal, but
not it) which, like the Books of the Kings of Israel and Judah, recorded
the deaths and burials, as well as the pedigrees and deeds, of the
Danish kings.

The various stages of the "obsequy by fire" are noted; the byre
sometimes formed out of a ship; the "sati"; the devoted bower- maidens
choosing to die with their mistress, the dead man's beloved (cf. The
Eddic funerals of Balder, Sigfred, and Brunhild, in the Long "Brunhild's
Lay", Tregrof Gudrumar and the lost poem of Balder's death paraphrased
in the prose Edda); the last message given to the corpse on the pyre
(Woden's last words to Balder are famous); the riding round the pyre;
the eulogium; the piling of the barrow, which sometimes took whole days,
as the size of many existing grass mounds assure us; the funeral feast,
where an immense vat of ale or mead is drunk in honor of the dead; the
epitaph, like an ogham, set up on a stone over the barrow.

The inclusion of a live man with the dead in a barrow, with the live or
fresh-slain beasts (horse and bound) of the dead man, seems to point to
a time or district when burning was not used. Apparently, at one time,
judging from Frode's law, only chiefs and warriors were burnt.

Not to bury was, as in Hellas, an insult to the dead, reserved for the
bodies of hated foes. Conquerors sometimes show their magnanimity (like
Harald Godwineson) by offering to bury their dead foes.

The buried "barrow-ghost" was formidable; he could rise and slay and
eat, vampire-like, as in the tale of Asmund and Aswit. He must in such
case be mastered and prevented doing further harm by decapitation and
thigh-forking, or by staking and burning. So criminals' bodies were
often burnt to stop possible haunting.

Witches and wizards could raise corpses by spells to make them prophesy.
The dead also appeared in visions, usually foretelling death to the
person they visited.

OTHER WORLDS. -- The "Land of Undeath" is spoken of as a place reached
by an exiled hero in his wanderings. We know it from Eric the
traveller's S., Helge Thoreson's S., Herrand and Bose S., Herwon S.,
Thorstan Baearmagn S., and other Icelandic sources. But the voyage to
the Other Worlds are some of the most remarkable of the narratives Saxo
has preserved for us.

"Hadding's Voyage Underground". -- (a) A woman bearing in her lap
angelica fresh and green, though it was deep winter, appears to the hero
at supper, raising her head beside the brazier. Hadding wishes to know
where such plants grow.

\(b\) She takes him with her, under cover of her mantle, underground.

\(c\) They pierce a mist, get on a road worn by long use, pass
nobly-clad men, and reach the sunny fields that bear the angelica: --

         "Through griesly shadowes by a beaten path,
         Into a garden goodly garnished."
         -- F.Q. ii. 7, 51.

\(d\) Next they cross, by a bridge, the "River of Blades", and see "two
armies fighting", ghosts of slain soldiers.

\(e\) Last they came to a high wall, which surrounds the land of Life,
for a cock the woman brought with her, whose neck she wrung and tossed
over this wall, came to life and crowed merrily.

Here the story breaks off. It is unfinished, we are only told that
Hadfling got back. Why he was taken to this under-world? Who took him?
What followed therefrom? Saxo does not tell. It is left to us to make
out.

That it is an archaic story of the kind in the Thomas of Ercildoune and
so many more fairy-tales, e.g., Kate Crack-a-Nuts, is certain. The
"River of Blades" and "The Fighting Warriors" are known from the Eddic
Poems. The angelica is like the green birk of that superb fragment, the
ballad of the Wife of Usher's Well -- a little more frankly heathen, of
course --

         "It fell about the Martinmas, when nights are long and mirk,
         The carline wife's three sons cam hame, and their hats were
              o' the birk.
         It neither grew in syke nor dyke, nor yet in ony sheugh,
         But at the gates o' Paradise that birk grew fair eneuch."

The mantel is that of Woden when he bears the hero over seas; the cock
is a bird of sorcery the world over; the black fowl is the proper gift
to the Underground powers -- a heriot really, for did not the Culture
god steal all the useful beasts out of the underground world for men's
use?

Dr. Rydberg has shown that the "Seven Sleepers" story is an old Northern
myth, alluded to here in its early pre-Christian form, and that with
this is mixed other incidents from voyages of Swipdag, the Teutonic
Odusseus.

"Thorkill's Second Voyage to Outgarth-Loke to get Knowledge". -- (a)
Guthrum is troubled as to the immortality and fate of the soul, and the
reward of piety after death. To spite Thorkill, his enviers advised the
king to send him to consult Outgarth- Loke. He required of the king that
his enemies should be sent with him.

\(b\) In one well-stored and hide-defended ship they set out, reached a
sunless, starless land, without fuel; ate raw food and suffered. At
last, after many days, a fire was seen ashore. Thorkill, setting a jewel
at the mast-head to be able to regain his vessel easily, rows ashore to
get fire.

\(c\) In a filthy, snake-paved, stinking cavern he sees two horny-
nebbed giants, (2) making a fire. One of the giants offers to direct him
to Loke if he will say three true things in three phrases, and this
done, tells him to row four days and then he would reach a Dark and
Grassless Land. For three more true sayings he obtains fire, and gets
back to his vessel.

\(d\) With good wind they make Grassless Land, go ashore, find a huge,
rocky cavern, strike a flint to kindle a fire at the entrance as a
safeguard against demons, and a torch to light them as they explored the
cavern.

\(e\) First appears iron seats set amid crawling snakes.

\(f\) Next is sluggish water flowing over sand.

\(g\) Last a steep, sloping cavern is reached, in a chamber of which lay
Outgarth-Loke chained, huge and foul.

\(h\) Thorkill plucks a hair of his beard "as big as a cornel-wood
spear." The stench that arose was fearful; the demens and snakes fell
upon the invaders at once; only Thorkill and five of the crew, who had
sheltered themselves with hides against the virulent poison the demons
and snakes cast, which would take a head off at the neck if it fell upon
it, got back to their ship.

\(i\) By vow to the "God that made the world", and offerings, a good
voyage was made back, and Germany reached, where Thorkill became a
Christian. Only two of his men survived the effects of the poison and
stench, and he himself was scarred and spoilt in the face.

\(k\) When he reached the king, Guthrum would not listen to his tale,
because it was prophesied to him that he would die suddenly if he heard
it; nay, he even sent men to smite him as he lay in bed, but, by the
device of laying a log in his place, he escaped, and going to the king
as he sat at meat, reproached him for his treachery.

\(l\) Guthrum bade him tell his story, but died of horror at hearing his
god Loke foully spoken of, while the stench of the hair that Thorkill
produced, as Othere did his horn for a voucher of his speech, slew many
bystanders.

This is the regular myth of Loke, punished by the gods, lying bound with
his own soils' entrails on three sharp stones and a sword-blade, (this
latter an addition, when the myth was made stones were the only blades),
with snakes' venom dripping on to him, so that when it falls on him he
shakes with pain and makes earthquakes -- a Titan myth in answer to the
question, "Why does the earth quake?" The vitriolic power of the poison
is excellently expressed in the story. The plucking of the hair as a
token is like the plucking of a horn off the giant or devil that occurs
in some folk-tale.

MAGIC AND FOLK-SCIENCE.

There is a belief in magic throughout Saxo's work, showing how fresh
heathendom still was in men's minds and memories. His explanations, when
he euhemerizes, are those of his day.

By means of spells all kinds of wonders could be effected, and the
powers of nature forced to work for the magician or his favourite.

"Skin-changing" (so common in "Landnamaboc") was as well known as in the
classic world of Lucian and Apuleius; and, where Frode perishes of the
attacks of a witch metamorphosed into a walrus.

"Mist" is induced by spells to cover and hide persons, as in Homer, and
"glamour" is produced by spells to dazzle foemen's sight. To cast
glamour and put confusion into a besieged place a witch is employed by
the beleaguerer, just as William the Conqueror used the witch in the
Fens against Hereward's fortalice. A soothsayer warns Charles the Great
of the coming of a Danish fleet to the Seine's mouth.

"Rain and bad weather" may be brought on, as in a battle against the
enemy, but in this, as in other instances, the spell may be
counteracted.

"Panic Terror" may be induced by the spell worked with a dead horse's
head set up on a pole facing the antagonist, but the spell may be met
and combatted by silence and a counter-curse.

"Magic help" may be got by calling on the friendly magician's name. The
magician has also the power of summoning to him anyone, however
unwilling, to appear.

Of spells and magic power to blunt steel there are several instances;
they may be counteracted (as in the Icelandic Sagas) by using the hilt,
or a club, or covering the blade with fine skin. In another case the
champion can only be overcome by one that will take up some of the dust
from under his feet. This is effected by the combatants shifting their
ground and exchanging places. In another case the foeman can only be
slain by gold, whereupon the hero has a gold-headed mace made and
batters the life out of him therewith. The brothers of Swanhild cannot
be cut by steel, for their mail was charmed by the witch Gudrun, but
Woden taught Eormenric, the Gothic king, how to overcome them with
stones (which apparently cannot, as archaic weapons, be charmed against
at all, resisting magic like wood and water and fire). Jordanis tells
the true history of Ermanaric, that great Gothic emperor whose rule from
the Dnieper to the Baltic and Rhine and Danube, and long reign of
prosperity, were broken by the coming of the Huns. With him vanished the
first great Teutonic empire.

Magic was powerful enough even to raise the dead, as was practised by
the Perms, who thus renewed their forces after a battle. In the
Everlasting battle the combatants were by some strange trick of fate
obliged to fulfil a perennial weird (like the unhappy Vanderdecken).
Spells to wake the dead were written on wood and put under the corpses'
tongue. Spells (written on bark) induce frenzy.

"Charms" would secure a man against claw or tooth.

"Love philtres" (as in the long "Lay of Gudrun) appear as everywhere in
savage and archaic society.

"Food", porridge mixed with the slaver of tortured snakes, gives magic
strength or endues the eater with eloquence and knowledge of beast and
bird speech (as Finn's broiled fish and Sigfred's broiled dragon-heart
do).

"Poison" like these hell-broths are part of the Witch or Obi
stock-in-trade, and Frode uses powdered gold as an antidote.

"Omens" are observed; tripping as one lands is lucky (as with our
William the Norman). Portents, such as a sudden reddening of the sea
where the hero is drowned, are noticed and interpreted.

"Dreams" (cf. Eddic Lays of Attila, and the Border ballads) are
prophetic (as nine-tenths of Europeans firmly believe still); thus the
visionary flame-spouting dragon is interpreted exactly as Hogne's and
Attila's dreams. The dreams of the three first bridals nights (which
were kept hallowed by a curious superstition, either because the dreams
would then bold good, or as is more likely, for fear of some Asmodeus)
were fateful. Animals and birds in dreams are read as persons, as
nowadays.

A "curse" is powerful unless it can be turned back, when it will harm
its utterer, for harm someone it must. The "curse" of a dying man on his
slayer, and its lack of effect, is noted.

Sometimes "magic messengers" are sent, like the swans that bore a token
and uttered warning songs to the hero.

"Witches and wizards" (as belonging to the older layer of archaic
beliefs) are hateful to the gods, and Woden casts them out as accursed,
though he himself was the mightiest of wizards. Heathen Teutonic life
was a long terror by reason of witchcraft, as is the heathen African
life to-day, continual precautions being needful to escape the magic of
enemies. The Icelandic Sagas, such as Gretter's, are full of magic and
witchcraft. It is by witchcraft that Gretter is first lamed and finally
slain; one can see that Glam's curse, the Beowulf motif, was not really
in the original Gretter story.

"Folk-medicine" is really a branch of magic in old days, even to such
pioneers of science as Paracelsus.

Saxo's traditions note drinking of a lion's blood that eats men as a
means of gaining might and strength; the drinking of bear's blood is
also declared to give great bodily power.

The tests for "madness" are of a primitive character, such as those
applied to Odusseus, who, however, was not able, like Hamlet, to evade
them.

The test for death is the red-hot iron or hot brand (used by the
Abyssinians of to-day, as it was supposed in the thirteenth century to
have been used by Grimhild. "And now Grimhild goes and takes a great
brand, where the house had burnt, and goes to Gernot her brother, and
thrusts the burning brand in his mouth, and will know whether he is dead
or living. But Gernot was clearly dead. And now she goes to Gislher and
thrusts the firebrand in his mouth. He was not dead before, but Gislher
died of that. Now King Thidrec of Bern saw what Grimhild is doing, and
speaks to King Attila. \`See how that devil Grimhild, thy wife, is
killing her brothers, the good warriors, and how many men have lost
their lives for her sake, and how many good men she has destroyed, Huns
and Amalungs and Niflungs; and in the same way would she bring thee and
me to hell, if she could do it?' Then spake King Attila, \`Surely she is
a devil, and slay thou her, and that were a good work if thou had done
it seven nights ago! Then many a gallant fellow were whole that is now
dead.' Now King Thidrec springs at Grimhild and swings up his sword
Eckisax, and hews her asunder at the middle").

It was believed (as in Polynesia, where "Captain Cook's path" was shown
in the grass) that the heat of the hero's body might blast the grass; so
Starcad's entrails withered the grass.

It was believed that a severed head might bite the ground in rage, and
there were certainly plenty of opportunities for observation of such
cases.

It was believed that a "dumb man" might be so wrought on by passion that
he would speak, and wholly acquire speech-power.

Little is told of "surgery", but in one case of intestines protruding
owing to wounds, withies were employed to bind round the trunk and keep
the bowels from risk till the patient could be taken to a house and his
wounds examined and dressed. It was considered heroic to pay little heed
to wounds that were not dangerous, but just to leave them to nature.

Personal "cleanliness" was not higher than among savages now. A lover is
loused by his lady after the mediaeval fashion.

CHRISTIANITY -- In the first nine books of Saxo, which are devoted to
heathendom, there is not much save the author's own Christian point of
view that smacks of the New Faith. The apostleships of Ansgarius in
Denmark, the conversion of King Eric, the Christianity of several later
Danish Kings, one of whom was (like Olaf Tryggwason) baptised in Britain
are also noticed.

Of "Christian legends" and beliefs, besides the euhemerist theory,
widely held, of the heathen gods there are few hints, save the idea that
Christ was born in the reign of Frode, Frode having been somehow
synchronised with Augustus, in whose reign also there was a world-peace.

Of course the christening of Scandinavia is history, and the mythic
books are little concerned with it. The episode in Adam of Bremen, where
the king offers the people, if they want a new god, to deify Eric, one
of their hero-kings, is eminently characteristic and true.

FOLK-TALES.

There might be a classification of Saxo's stories akin to that of the
Irish poets, Battles, Sieges, Voyages, Rapes, Cattle Forays, etc.; and
quite apart from the historic element, however faint and legendary,
there are a set of stories ascribed by him, or rather his authorities,
to definite persons, which had, even in his day, probably long been the
property of Tis, their original owners not being known owing to lapse of
time and the wear of memory, and the natural and accidental
catastrophies that impair the human record. Such are the "Dragon-Slayer"
stories. In one type of these the hero (Frithlaf) is cast on a desolate
island, and warned by a dream to attack and slay a dragon guarding
treasure. He wakes, sees the dragon arise out of the waves, apparently,
to come ashore and go back to the cavern or mound wherein the treasure
lay. His scales are too hard to pierce; he is terribly strong, lashing
trees down with his tail, and wearing a deep path through the wood and
over the stones with his huge and perpetual bulk; but the hero, covered
with hide-wrapped shield against the poison, gets down into the hollow
path, and pierces the monster from below, afterward rifling its
underground store and carrying off its treasure.

Again the story is repeated; the hero (Frode Haddingsson) is warned by a
countryman of the island-dragon and its hoard, is told to cover his
shield and body with bulls' hides against the poison, and smite the
monster's belly. The dragon goes to drink, and, as it is coming back, it
is attacked, slain, and its treasure lifted precisely as before. The
analogies with the Beowulf and Sigfred stories are evident; but no great
poet has arisen to weave the dragon-slaying intimately into the lives of
Frode and Frithlaf as they have been woven into the tragedy of Sigfred
the wooer of Brunhild and, if Dr. Vigffisson be right the conqueror of
Varus, or into the story of Beowulf, whose real engagements were with
sea-monsters, not fiery dragons.

Another type is that of the "Loathly Worm". A king out hunting (Herod or
Herraud, King of Sweden), for some unexplained reason brings home two
small snakes as presents for his daughter. They wax wonderfully, have to
be fed a whole ox a day, and proceed to poison and waste the
countryside. The wretched king is forced to offer his daughter (Thora)
to anyone who will slay them. The hero (Ragnar) devises a dress of a
peculiar kind (by help of his nurse, apparently), in this case, woolly
mantle and hairy breeches all frozen and ice-covered to resist the
venom, then strapping his spear to his hand, he encounters them boldly
alone. The courtiers hide "like frightened little girls", and the king
betakes him to a "narrow shelter", an euphemism evidently of Saxo's, for
the scene is comic. The king comes forth when the hero is victorious,
and laughing at his hairy legs, nick-names him Shaggy-breech, and bids
him to the feast. Ragnar fetches up his comrades, and apparently seeks
out the frightened courtiers (no doubt with appropriate quip, omitted by
Saxo, who hurries on), feasts, marries the king's daughter, and begets
on her two fine sons.

Of somewhat similar type is the proud "Maiden guarded" by Beasts. Here
the scene is laid in Gaulardale in Norway. The lady is Ladgerda, the
hero Ragnar. Enamoured of the maiden by seeing her prowess in war, he
accepts no rebuffs, but leaving his followers, enters the house, slays
the guardian Bear and Dog, thrusting one through with a spear and
throttling the other with his hand. The lady is won and wed, and two
daughters and a son (Frithlaf) duly begotten. The story of Alf and
Alfhild combines several types. There are the tame snakes, the baffled
suitors' heads staked to terrify other suitors, and the hero using
red-hot iron and spear to slay the two reptiles.

The "Proud Lady", (cf. Kudrun and the Niebelungen, and Are's story of
the queen that burnt her suitors) appears in Hermintrude, Queen of
Scotland, who battles and slays her lovers, but is out-witted by the
hero (Hamlet), and, abating her arrogance, agrees to wed him. This seems
an obvious accretion in the original Hamlet story, and probably owing
not to Saxo, but to his authority.

The "Beggar that stole the Lady" (told of Snio Siwaldson and the
daughter of the King of the Goths), with its brisk dialogue, must have
been one of the most artful of the folk-tales worked on by Saxo or his
informants; but it is only half told, unfortunately.

The "Crafty Soaker" is another excellent comic folk-tale. A terrible
famine made the king (Snio) forbid brewing to save the barley for bread,
and abolished all needless toping. The Soaker baffled the king by
sipping, never taking a full draught. Rebuked, be declared that he never
drank, but only sucked a drop. This was forbidden him for the future, so
he sopped his bread in ale, and in that inconvenient manner continued to
get drunk, excusing himself with the plea that though it was forbidden
to drink or sip beer, it was not forbidden to eat it. When this was in
turn prohibited, the Soaker gave up any pretence, and brewed and drank
unabashed, telling the angry king that he was celebrating his
approaching funeral with due respect, which excuse led to the repeal of
the obnoxious decree. A good Rabelaisian tale, that must not have been
wide-spread among the Danish topers, whose powers both Saxo and
Shakespeare have celebrated, from actual experience no doubt.

The "Magician's tricks to elude pursuit", so common an incident in our
fairy tales, e.g., Michael Scot's flight, is ascribed here to the
wonder-working and uncanny Finns, who, when pursued, cast behind them
successively three pebbles, which become to their enemies' eyes
mountains, then snow, which appeared like a roaring torrent. But they
could not cast the glamour on Arngrim a third time, and were forced to
submit. The glamour here and in the case of the breaking of Balder's
barrow is akin to that which the Druid puts on the sons of Uisnach.

The tale of the king who shuts up his daughter in an "earth- house" or
underground chamber with treasures (weapons and gold and silver), in
fear of invasion, looks like a bit of folk-tale, such as the "Hind in
the Wood", but it may have a traditional base of some kind here.

A folk-tale, very imperfectly narrated, is the "Clever King's Daughter",
who evidently in the original story had to choose her suitor by his feet
(as the giantess in the prose Edda chooses her husband), and was able to
do so by the device she had practised of sewing up her ring in his leg
sometime before, so that when she touched the flesh she could feel the
hardness of the ring beneath the scar.

Bits of folk-tales are the "Device for escaping threatened death by
putting a log in one's bed" (as in our Jack the Giant-Killer). The
device, as old as David's wife, of dressing up a dummy (here a basket
with a dog inside, covered outside with clothes), while the hero
escapes, is told of Eormenric, the mighty Gothic King of Kings, who,
like Walter of Aquitaine, Theodoric of Varona, Ecgherht, and Arminius,
was an exile in his youth. This traditional escape of the two lads from
the Scyths should be compared with the true story in Paul the Deacon of
his little ancestor's captivity and bold and successful stroke for
freedom.

"Disguise" plays a great part in the folk-tales used by Saxo. Woden
disguises himself in a cowl on his earthly travels, and heroes do the
same; a king disguises himself as a slave at his rival's court, to try
and find occasion of slaying him; a hero wraps himself up in skins, like
Alleleirah.

"Escaped recognition" is accordingly a feature in many of these simple
but artistic plots. A son is not known by his mother in the story of
Hrolf.

Other "Devices" are exemplified, such as the "booby-trap" loaded with a
millstone, which slays a hateful and despised tyrant, imposed by a
foreign conqueror; evasion by secret passages, and concealment in
underground vaults or earth-houses. The feigning of madness to escape
death occurs, as well as in the better-known Hamlet story. These
stratagems are universal in folk-history.

To Eric, the clever and quick of speech, is ascribed an excellent
sailor's smuggling trick to hide slaughtered cattle, by sinking them
till the search is over.

The "Hero's Mighty Childhood" (like David's) of course occurs when he
binds a bear with his girdle. Sciold is full grown at fifteen, and
Hadding is full grown in extreme youth. The hero in his boyhood slays a
full-grown man and champion. The cinder- biting, lazy stage of a mighty
youth is exemplified.

The "fierce eyes" of the hero or heroine, which can daunt an assassin as
could the piercing glance of Marius, are the "falcon eyes" of the Eddic
Lays.

The shining, effulgent, "illuminating hair" of the hero, which gives
light in the darkness, is noticed here, as it obtains in Cuaran's
thirteenth century English legend.

The wide-spread tale of the "City founded on a site marked out by a hide
cut into finest thongs", occurs, told of Hella and Iwarus exactly as our
Kentishmen told it of Hengist, and as it is also told of Dido.

The incidents of the "hero sleeping by a rill", of the guarded king's
daughter, with her thirty attendants, the king's son keeping sheep, are
part of the regular stock incidents in European folk-tales. So are the
Nausicaa incident of the "king's daughter going a washing", the hero
disguising himself as a woman and winding wool (like a second Heracles).

There are a certain number of stories, which only occur in Saxo and in
our other Northern sources with attributions, though they are of course
legendary; such are:

The "Everlasting Battle" between Hedhin and Hogne, a legend connected
with the great Brisinga-men story, and paralleled by the Cordelia-tale
among the Britons.

The story of the "Children preserved" is not very clearly told, and Saxo
seems to have euhemerized. It is evidently of the same type as the
Lionel-Lancelot story in the Arthurian cycle. Two children, ordered to
be killed, are saved by the slaying of other children in their place;
and afterwards by their being kept and named as dogs; they come to their
own and avenge their wrongs.

The "Journey to Hell" story is told of Eric, who goes to a far land to
fetch a princess back, and is successful. It is apparently an adventure
of Swipdag, if everyone had their rights. It is also told of Thorkill,
whose adventures are rather of the "True Thomas" type.

The "Test of Endurance" by sitting between fires, and the relief of the
tortured and patient hero by a kindly trick, is a variant of the famous
Eddic Lays concerning Agnar.

The "Robbers of the Island", evidently comes from an Icelandic source
(cf. The historic "Holmveria Saga" and Icelandic folk- tales of later
date), the incident of the hero slaying his slave, that the body might
be mistaken for his, is archaic in tone; the powerful horse recalls
Grani, Bayard, and even Sleipner; the dog which had once belonged to
Unfoot (Ofote), the giant shepherd (cf. its analogues in old Welsh
tales), is not quite assimilated or properly used in this story. It
seems (as Dr. Rydberg suspects) a mythical story coloured by the
Icelandic relater with memory full of the robber-hands of his own land.

The stratagem of "Starcad", who tried even in death to slay his slayer,
seems an integral part of the Starcad story; as much as the doom of
three crimes which are to be the price for the threefold life that a
triple man or giant should enjoy. The noose story in Starcad (cf. that
told of Bicce in the Eormenric story), is also integral.

SAXO'S MYTHOLOGY.

No one has commented upon Saxo's mythology with such brilliancy, such
minute consideration, and such success as the Swedish scholar, Victor
Rydberg. More than occasionally he is over- ingenious and over-anxious
to reduce chaos to order; sometimes he almost loses his faithful reader
in the maze he treads so easily and confidently, and sometimes he
stumbles badly. But he has placed the whole subject on a fresh footing,
and much that is to follow will be drawn from his "Teutonic Mythology"
(cited here from the English version by Rasmus B. Anderson, London,
1889, as "T.M.").

Let us take first some of the incontestable results of his
investigations that affect Saxo.

SCIOLD is the father of Gram in Saxo, and the son of Sceaf in other
older authorities. Dr. Rydberg (97-101) forms the following equations
for the Sciolding patriarchs: --

         a. Scef -- Heimdal -- Rig.
         b. Sciold -- Borgar -- Jarl.
         c. Gram -- Halfdan -- Koming.

Chief among the mythic tales that concern Saxo are the various portions
of the Swipdag-Myth, which Dr. Rydberg has been able to complete with
much success. They may be resumed briefly as follows: --

Swipdag, helped by the incantations of his dead mother, whom he had
raised from the dead to teach him spells of protection, sets forth on
his quests. He is the Odusseus of the Teutonic mythology. He desires to
avenge his father on Halfdan that slew him. To this end he must have a
weapon of might against Halfdan's club. The Moon-god tells him of the
blade Thiasse has forged. It has been stolen by Mimer, who has gone out
into the cold wilderness on the rim of the world. Swipdag achieves the
sword, and defeats and slays Halfdan. He now buys a wife, Menglad, of
her kinsmen the gods by the gift of the sword, which thus passes into
Frey's hands.

How he established a claim upon Frey, and who Menglad was, is explained
in Saxo's story of Eric, where the characters may be identified thus: --

         Swipdag -- Eric
         Freya -- Gunwara
         Frey -- Frode III
         Niord -- Fridlaf
         Wuldor -- Roller
         Thor -- Brac
         Giants -- The Greps
         Giants -- Coller.

Frey and Freya had been carried off by the giants, and Swipdag and his
faithful friend resolve to get them back for the Anses, who bewail their
absence. They journey to Monster-land, win back the lady, who ultimately
is to become the hero's wife, and return her to her kindred; but her
brother can only be rescued by his father Niord. It is by wit rather
than by force that Swipdag is successful here.

The third journey of Swipdag is undertaken on Frey's behalf; he goes
under the name of Scirner to woo giant Gymer's daughter Gerth for his
brother-in-law, buying her with the sword that he himself had paid to
Frey as his sister's bride-price. So the sword gets back to the giants
again.

Swipdag's dead foe Halfdan left two young "avengers", Hadding and
Guthorm, whom he seeks to slay. But Thor-Brache gives them in charge of
two giant brothers. Wainhead took care of Hadding, Hafle of Guthorm.
Swipdag made peace with Guthorm, in a way not fully explained to us, but
Hadding took up the blood-feud as soon as he was old enough.

Hadding was befriended by a woman, who took him to the Underworld -- the
story is only half told in Saxo, unluckily -- and by Woden, who took him
over-sea wrapt in his mantle as they rode Sleipner over the waves; but
here again Saxo either had not the whole story before him, or he wished
to abridge it for some reason or prejudice, and the only result of this
astonishing pilgrimage is that Woden gives the young hero some useful
counsels. He falls into captivity, entrapped by Loke (for what reason
again we are left to guess), and is exposed to wild beasts, but he slays
the wolf that attacks him, and eating its heart as Woden had bidden him,
he gains wisdom and foresight.

Prepared by these adventures, he gets Guthorm to join him (how or why
the peace between him and Swipdag was broken, we know not), and they
attack their father's slayer, but are defeated, though Woden sunk Asmund
Swipdag's son's ship, Grio, at Hlessey, and Wainhead and Hardgrip his
daughter fought for Hadding.

Hadding wanders off to the East with his foster-sister and mistress and
Hardgrip, who is slain protecting him against an angry ghost raised from
the Underworld by her spells. However, helped by Heimdal and Woden (who
at this time was an exile), Hadding's ultimate success is assured.

When Woden came back to power, Swipdag, whose violence and pride grew
horribly upon him, was exiled, possibly by some device of his foes, and
took upon him, whether by will or doom, a sea- monster's shape. His
faithful wife follows him over land and sea, but is not able to save
him. He is met by Hadding and, after a fierce fight, slain. Swipdag's
wife cursed the conqueror, and he was obliged to institute an annual
sacrifice to Frey (her brother) at Upsale, who annuls the curse. Loke,
in seal's guise, tried to steal the necklace of Freya at the Reef of
Treasures, where Swipdag was slain, but Haimdal, also in seal- skin,
fought him, and recovered it for the gods.

Other myths having reference to the goddesses appear in Saxo. There is
the story of "Heimdall and Sol", which Dr. Rydberg has recognised in the
tale of Alf and Alfhild. The same tale of how the god won the sun for
his wife appears in the mediaeval German King Ruther (in which title Dr.
Ryuberg sees Hrutr, a name of the ram-headed god).

The story of "Othar" (Od) and "Syritha" (Sigrid) is obviously that of
Freya and her lover. She has been stolen by the giants, owing to the
wiles of her waiting-maid, Loke's helper, the evil witch Angrbode. Od
seeks her, finds her, slays the evil giant who keeps her in the cave;
but she is still bewitched, her hair knotted into a hard, horny mass,
her eyes void of brightness. Unable to gain recognition he lets her go,
and she is made by a giantess to herd her flocks. Again found by Od, and
again refusing to recognise him, she is let go again. But this time she
flies to the world of men, and takes service with Od's mother and
father. Here, after a trial of her love, she and Od are reconciled.
Sywald (Sigwald), her father, weds Od's sister.

The tale of the vengeance of Balder is more clearly given by the Dane,
and with a comic force that recalls the Aristophanic fun of Loka-senna.
It appears that the story had a sequel which only Saxo gives. Woden had
the giantess Angrbode, who stole Freya, punished. Frey, whose
mother-in-law she was, took up her quarrel, and accusing Woden of
sorcery and dressing up like a woman to betray Wrind, got him banished.
While in exile Wuldor takes Woden's place and name, and Woden lives on
earth, part of the time at least, with Scathe Thiasse's daughter, who
had parted from Niord.

The giants now resolved to attack Ansegard; and Woden, under the name of
Yggr, warned the gods, who recall him after ten years' exile.

But for Saxo this part of the story of the wars of the gods would be
very fragmentary.

The "Hildiger story", where a father slays his son unwittingly, and then
falls at his brother's hand, a tale combining the Rustam and the
Balin-Balan types, is one of the Hilding tragedies, and curiously
preserved in the late "Saga of Asmund the Champions' bane". It is an
antithesis, as Dr. Rydberg remarks, to the Hildebrand and Hadubrand
story, where father and son must fight and are reconciled.

The "story of Orwandel" (the analogue of Orion the Hunter) must be
gathered chiefly from the prose Edda. He was a huntsman, big enough and
brave enough to cope with giants. He was the friend of Thor, the husband
of Groa, the father of Swipdag, the enemy of giant Coller and the
monster Sela. The story of his birth, and of his being blinded, are lost
apparently in the Teutonic stories, unless we may suppose that the
bleeding of Robin Hood till he could not see by the traitorous prioress
is the last remains of the story of the great archer's death.

Great part of the troubles which befell the gods arose from the
antagonism of the sons of Iwalde and the brethren Sindre and Brokk
(Cinder and Brank), rival artist families; and it was owing to the
retirement of their artist foster-parents that Frey and Freya were left
among the giants. The Hniflung hoard is also supposed to have consisted
of the treasures of one band of primaeval artists, the Iwaldings.

Whether we have here the phenomenon of mythological doublets belonging
to different tribes, or whether we have already among these early names
that descent of story which has led to an adventure of Moses being
attributed to Garibaldi, given to Theodoric the king the adventures of
Theodoric the god, taken Arthur to Rome, and Charles the Great to
Constantinople, it is hard to say.

The skeleton-key of identification, used even as ably as Dr. Rydberg
uses it, will not pick every mythologic lock, though it undoubtedly has
opened many hitherto closed. The truth is that man is a finite animal;
that he has a limited number of types of legend; that these legends, as
long as they live and exist, are excessively prehensile; that, like the
opossum, they can swing from tree to tree without falling; as one tree
dies out of memory they pass on to another. When they are scared away by
what is called exact intelligence from the tall forest of great
personalities, they contrive to live humbly clinging to such bare plain
stocks and poles (Tis and Jack and Cinderella) as enable them to find a
precarious perch.

To drop similitudes, we must be prepared, in unravelling our tangled
mythology, to go through several processes. We must, of course, note the
parallelisms and get back to the earliest attribution-names we can find.
But all system is of late creation, it does not begin till a certain
political stage, a stage where the myths of coalescing clans come into
contact, and an official settlement is attempted by some school of poets
or priests. Moreover, systematization is never so complete that it
effaces all the earlier state of things. Behind the official systems of
Homer and Hesiod lies the actual chaos of local faiths preserved for us
by Pausanias and other mythographers. The common factors in the various
local faiths are much the majority among the factors they each possess;
and many of these common factors are exceedingly primitive, and resolve
themselves into answers to the questions that children still ask, still
receiving no answer but myth -- that is, poetic and subjective
hypothesis, containing as much truth as they can receive or their
inventors can grasp.

Who were our forbears? How did day and night, sun and moon, earth and
water, and fire come? How did the animals come? Why has the bear no
tail? Why are fishes dumb, the swallow cleft- tail? How did evil come?
Why did men begin to quarrel? How did death arise? What will the end be?
Why do dead persons come back? What do the dead do? What is the earth
shaped like? Who invented tools and weapons, and musical instruments,
and how? When did kings and chiefs first come?

From accepted answers to such questions most of the huge mass of
mythology arises. Man makes his gods in his own image, and the doctrines
of omen, coincidence, and correspondence helped by incessant and
imperfect observation and logic, bring about a system of religious
observance, of magic and ritual, and all the masses of folly and
cruelty, hope and faith, and even charity, that group about their
inventions, and seem to be the necessary steps in the onward path of
progressive races.

When to these we add the true and exaggerated memories of actual heroes,
the material before the student is pretty completely comprised. Though
he must be prepared to meet the difficulties caused in the contact of
races, of civilisations, by the conversion of persons holding one set of
mythical ideas to belief in another set of different, more attractive,
and often more advanced stage.

The task of arriving at the scientific, speculative ethic, and the
actual practice of our remote ancestry (for to that end is the student
of mythology and folk-lore aiming) is not therefore easy. Nor is the
record perfect, though it is not so poor in most cases as was once
believed. The Brothers Grimm, patriarchs alike as mythologists and
folk-lorists, the Castor and Pollox of our studies, have proved this as
regards the Teutonic nations, just as they showed us, by many a striking
example, that in great part folk-lore was the mythology of to-day, and
mythology the folk-lore of yesterday.

In many cases we are helped by quite modern material to make out some
puzzle that an old tale presents, and there is little doubt but that the
present activity in the field of folklore will not only result in fresh
matter but in fresh methods freshly applied.

The Scandinavian material, at all events, is particularly rich: there is
the extensive Icelandic written literature touching the ninth and tenth
and eleventh centuries; the noble, if fragmentary remains of Old
Northern poetry of the Wickingtide; and lastly, the mass of tradition
which, surviving in oral form, and changing in colour from generation to
generation, was first recorded in part in the seventeenth, and again in
part, in the present century; and all these yield a plentiful field for
research. But their evidence gains immensely by the existence of Saxo's
nine books of traditional and mythic lore, collected and written down in
an age when much that was antique and heathen was passing away forever.
The gratitude due to the Welshman of the twelfth century, whose garnered
hoard has enriched so many poets and romances from his day to now, is no
less due to the twelfth- century Dane, whose faithful and eloquent
enthusiasm has swept much dust from antique time, and saved us such a
story as Shakespeare has not disdained to consecrate to highest use. Not
only Celtic and Teutonic lore are the richer for these two men, but the
whole Western world of thought and speech. In the history of modern
literature, it is but right that by the side of Geoffrey an honourable
place should be maintained for Saxo, and

"awake remembrance of these mighty dead."
