# HEROIC ROMANCES OF IRELAND

##### BY

### A. H. LEAHY

### IN TWO VOLUMES

###### Scanned at ith.oarc.science, November-February 2000.

These two books are scholarly translations of Irish legends. Although
many of the stories in these books center around cattle raids, they have
numerous supernatural incidents and remnants of pre-Christian religious
beliefs.

-   [Volume I.](hroiv1) \[1905\] *393,186 bytes*  
    The first volume contains five separate stories, the "Courtship of
    Etain," the "Boar of Mac Datho," the "Sick-bed of Cuchulain," the
    "Death of the Sons of Usnach" (Book of Leinster version), and the
    "Combat at the Ford" out of the Book of Leinster version of the
    "Tain bo Cuailnge." Two versions are given of the "Courtship of
    Etain "; and the "Sick-bed of Cuchulain".

-   [Volume II.](hroiv2) \[1906\] *230,468 bytes*  
    This part includes the five "Tains" or Cattle-Forays of Fraech (Tain
    bo Fraich), Dartaid (The Raid for Dartaid's Cattle), Regamon (The
    Raid for the Cattle of Regamon), Flidais (The Driving of the Cattle
    of Flidais), and Regamna (The Apparition of The Great Queen to
    Cuchulain); They are all expressly named as "fore-tales," remscéla,
    or preludes to the story of the great war of Cualnge, which is the
    central event in the Ulster heroic cycle. As an appendix, this book
    includes the Irish text and literal translation of an incident of
    the Courtship of Etain, which is translated in the first volume.

    The original book of Volume II. had literal and verse translations
    on facing pages. We have maintained the page order in the etext, and
    have left the page number markers so that the two translations can
    be distinguished.
