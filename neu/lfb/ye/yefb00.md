THE YELLOW FAIRY BOOK

Edited by ANDREW LANG

London, New York: Longmans, Green, and Co.

\[1894\]

Dedication

TO

JOAN, TODDLES, AND TINY

 

Books Yellow, Red, and Green and Blue,  
All true, or just as good as true,  
And here's the Yellow Book for YOU!

Hard is the path from A to Z,  
And puzzling to a curly head,  
Yet leads to Books—Green, Blue, and Red.

For every child should understand  
That letters from the first were planned  
To guide us into Fairy Land

So labour at your Alphabet,  
For by that learning shall you get  
To lands where Fairies may be met.

And going where this pathway goes,  
You too, at last, may find, who knows?  
The Garden of the Singing Rose.
