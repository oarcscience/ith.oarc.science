### LI.--THE HUNDRED-LEAVED ROSE.

THE man contended with Kurent for the earth. Unable to decide their
dispute by agreement, they seized each other, and struggled together up
and down the earth for full seven years; but neither could Kurent
overcome the man, nor the man Kurent. At that time they kicked the earth
about and broke it up, so that it became such as it now is: where there
was formerly nothing but wide plains, they dug out ravines with their
heels, and piled up mountains and hills. When they were wearied with
fighting, they both fell down like dead corpses, and lay for a hundred
and a hundred years; and the mighty Dobrin hastened to the earth, bound
both the man and Kurent, and ruled the world. But the two woke up, and,
looking about them, observed Dobrin's cords, and wondered who had thrown
spider's webs over them. Raising themselves, they broke their bonds as
mere spiders' webs, seized Dobrin, bound him with golden fetters, and
handed him over to a fiery dragon, to plait the lady-dragon's hair and
wash her white hands. Then said Kurent to the man: 'See, by quarrelling
we got tired out, and fell asleep, and a good-for-nothing came to us and
ruled the world. We have handed him over to the fiery dragon, but if we
contend as before, a stronger than Dobrin will come to us, and will
conquer both me and you, and we shall suffer like silly Dobrin. But let
us give up disputing; you are a hero, and I think I am, too; the hills
and abysses are our

witnesses, when they crashed under our heels. Hear, therefore, and
follow my advice. I have a garden, and in my garden is a mysterious
plant, the hundred-leaved rose. By the root it is attached to the bottom
of the earth, imprisoning a terrible creature--the living fire. In vain
does the creature endeavour to release and free itself from its bonds,
the roots. But woe to us, if you pull up the hundred-leaved rose out of
the earth! The creature 'living-fire' would force its way through, and
the earth, and all that is in it, would become nothing but a mighty
desert where the water has dried up. Such is the root of the
hundred-leaved rose. But don't seize hold of its top, either. It is in
your power to pull it off; it is neither too strong nor lofty, but it
conceals within it wondrous powers--lightning and thunder. They would
knock to pieces both you and the earth, and all that is beneath it and
above it; the hundred-leaved rose would alone remain; but a hundred and
a hundred of God's years would elapse before a new earth grew up around
it, and a living race was again produced. Such is the garden of the
hundred-leaved rose. But it also possesses extraordinary petals. I have
often sat a day at a time under them, and the petals would comfort me,
and sing songs sweeter than even the slender throat of a Vila singing
ever uttered. But from the petals there is no danger; pluck them, and
next morning they will sprout forth handsomer than ever. But up to the
present time I have not injured them, but have noticed in the night, how
they fell and raised themselves again; and I easily understood how the
stars and the moon go round, for all came up in the sky just like the
petals of the hundred-leaved rose. Come, then; let us ask the wondrous
plant, and then make peace together. The first petal is yours, the
second mine, the third belongs to neither of us, and so on till we pluck
all the petals: let him who pulls off the last petal be ruler on the
earth, but not for

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

ever, for that would be a disgrace to a hero, but for one of God's
hours, a hundred terrestrial years; and when the hour passes, let that
one rule again to whom that luck does not fall the first time, whether
it be I or you, so that we may arrange to succeed each other in a
friendly manner without dispute and dangerous discord. But the beginning
is difficult; let us have no suspicion, either I as to you, or you as to
me, but let all be of goodwill, and without trickery; let us ask the
hundred-leaved rose, with whom there is no unrighteousness. The man
agreed to what Kurent said; one hero trusted the other. They went off to
the garden, and asked the hundred-leaved rose. The man pulled a petal,
Kurent pulled one, and the third petal remained unowned. 'I am yours,'
'you are mine,' 'each is his own;' 'I am yours,' 'you are mine,' 'each
is his own;' so said both heroes, as they pulled the mysterious petals.
But it was not the will of the hundred-leaved rose that one autocrat
should rule the earth. There were still three petals, the first
belonging to the man, the second to Kurent, and the third to neither,
and this was the only one remaining on the hundred-leaved rose. Kurent
and the man saw that it was not destined for either to rule or to humble
himself; they parted in grief, and roamed through the wide world, each
afraid of the other, so that they did not venture even to go to sleep at
night. An hour of God, a hundred terrestrial years, elapsed, and then
both heroes met again. For the second time they consulted the
hundred-leaved rose, and it arranged it so, that Kurent was to humble
himself, and the man, who pulled off the last petal, was to rule. The
hero humbled himself to him, but the man did not know how to rule, but
allowed himself to be deluded, and lay down on a plain to rest and
sleep. Thus he lay for a whole hour of God, a hundred terrestrial years,
and the wild beasts came up and made game of him: foxes littered in his
ear, and

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

predaceous kites nested in his thick hair. The man was a great
simpleton, but also a mighty hero, as tall, as a plain, the end of which
you cannot see, is long, and as shaggy as a wooded mountain. But the
hour of God had elapsed, and Kurent came to the sleeper, and woke him up
in no agreeable fashion. The man saw that he had slept through his term
of rule, and that it was his, according to the agreement, to serve
during an hour of God, a hundred terrestrial years. Kurent began to
rule, but he didn't go to sleep, but made use of his rule, and exercised
his power to the full. He invited the man to dinner, and treated him in
a courteous and friendly manner, that he might soon forget his
servitude. Kurent kept this in view, and drew him a cup of wine straight
from his own vineyard. The simpleton was tricked, and drank it up; but
it tasted sour to him, so he grumbled: 'Bad drink at a bad host's!'
Kurent did not get angry at this, but drew him a second cup of old red
wine: 'Drink, and don't find fault with what is God's.' The second time
the man was tricked and drank it up. It did not taste sour to him, but
he said: 'Wondrous drink at a wondrous host's!' Kurent drew him a third
cup, of wonderful wine, which the first plant, the first planted,
yielded, of the first autumn in the first created year. The third time
the man was tricked, but for ever. After drinking it up, he threw his
arms round Kurent's neck, and cried out: 'Oh, good drink at a good
host's! Treat me with this wine, and rule both my body and soul, not
only for one hour of God, but from henceforth for evermore.' Kurent was
delighted, and plied the man with sweet wine, and the man drank, and
cried without ceasing, that he had no need of freedom so long as there
was wine to be had with Kurent. Kurent laughed at him, seeing how the
man's powers had decayed through wine, and that nobody could any more
contend with him for the sovereignty of the earth.
