# MORAVIAN STORIES

MORAVIA is so named from the river Morava (in German the river March),
of which, and its affluents, it is the basin. It falls into the Danube a
little above Presburg. In very early times Moravia appears to have been
more civilized and powerful than Bohemia; but later, Bohemia became a
considerable kingdom, and Moravia a dependency of, and eventually a
margravate under the Bohemian crown.

The Moravian stories differ but little in character from those of
Bohemia. The country, unlike Bohemia, abounds in dialects, although the
literary language is the Bohemian. On the east the Moravian melts into
the Silesian, or 'Water-Polish.'

[No. 8](sfs12.htm#an_08.md), 'Godmother Death,' is an interesting variant
of the Teutonic 'Godfather Death,' which is given by Grimm. The reason
why Death is represented as a Godmother, rather than a Godfather, in the
Moravian story, is, that Death (Smrt) is feminine in all Slavonic
dialects. The story constructed on this basis is more graceful and
fuller of incident than the Teutonic tale, in which Death is masculine.

[No. 9](sfs13.htm#an_09.md) is another story falling under the head of
'Natural Science in Allegory,' which is clearer and simpler in
construction and interpretation than any variant of it that I am
acquainted with.
