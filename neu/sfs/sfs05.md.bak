### II.--'THE THREE GOLDEN HAIRS OF GRANDFATHER ALLKNOW.'

THERE was once upon a time a king who delighted in hunting wild animals
in forests. One day he chased a stag to a great distance and lost his
way. He was all alone; night came on, and the king was only too glad to
find a cottage in a clearing. A charcoal-burner lived there. The king
asked him whether he would guide him out of the forest to the road,
promising to pay him well for it. 'I would gladly go with you,' said the
charcoal-burner, 'but, you see, my wife is expecting; I cannot go away.
And whither would you go at this time of night? Lie down on some hay on
the garret floor, and to-morrow morning I will be your guide.' Soon
afterwards a baby boy was born to the charcoal-burner. The king was
lying on the floor and couldn't sleep. At midnight he observed a kind of
light in the keeping-room below. He peeped through a chink in the
boarding and saw the charcoal-burner asleep, his wife lying in a dead
faint, and three old hags, all in white, standing by the baby, each with
a lighted taper in her hand. The first said: 'My gift to this boy is,
that he shall come into great dangers.' The second said: 'My gift to him
is, that he shall escape from them all and live long.' And the third
said: 'And I give him to wife the baby daughter who has this day been
born to that king who is lying upstairs on the hay.' Thereupon the hags
put out their tapers, and all was still again. They were the Fates.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The king felt as if a sword had been thrust into his breast. He didn't
sleep till morning, thinking over what to do, and how to do it, to
prevent that coming to pass which he had heard. When day dawned the
child began to cry. The charcoal-burner got up and saw that his wife had
gone to sleep for ever. 'Oh, my poor little orphan!' whimpered he; 'what
shall I do with you now?' 'Give me the baby,' said the king; 'I'll take
care that it shall be well with it, and will give you so much money that
you needn't burn char-coal as long as you live.' The charcoal-burner was
delighted at this, and the king promised to send for the baby. When he
arrived at his palace they told him, with great joy, that a beautiful
baby-daughter had been born to him on such and such a night. It was the
very night on which he saw the three Fates. The king frowned, called one
of his servants, and told him: 'Go to such a place in the forest; a
charcoal-burner lives there in a cottage. Give him this money, and he
will give you a little child. Take the child and drown it on your way
back. If you don't drown it, you shall drink water yourself.' The
servant went, took the baby and put it into a basket, and when he came
to a narrow foot-bridge, under which flowed a deep and broad river, he
threw the basket and all into the water. 'Good-night, uninvited
son-in-law!' said the king, when the servant told him what he had done.

The king thought that the baby was drowned, but it wasn't. It floated in
the water in the basket as if it had been its cradle, and slept as if
the river were singing to it, till it floated down to a fisherman's
cottage. The fisherman was sitting by the bank mending his net. He saw
something floating down the river, jumped into his boat, and went to
catch it, and out of the water he drew the baby in the basket. He
carried it to his wife, and said: 'You've always wanted a little son,
and here you have one. The

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

water has brought him to us.' The fisherman's wife was delighted, and
brought up the child as her own. They named him 'Floatling'
(*Plaváczek*), because he had floated to them on the water.

The river flowed on and years passed on, and from a boy he became a
handsome youth, the like of whom was not to be found far and wide. One
day in the summer it came to pass that the king rode that way all alone.
It was hot, and he was thirsty, and beckoned to the fisherman to give
him a little fresh water. When Floatling brought it to him, the king
looked at him with astonishment. 'You've a fine lad, fisherman!' said
he; 'is he your son?" 'He is and he isn't,' replied the fisherman; 'just
twenty years ago he floated, as a little baby, down the river in a
basket, and we brought him up.' A mist came before the king's eyes; he
became as pale as a whitewashed wall, perceiving that it was the child
he had ordered to be drowned. But he soon recollected himself, sprang
from his horse, and said: 'I want a messenger to my palace, and have
nobody with me: can this youth go thither for me?' 'Your majesty has but
to command and the lad will go,' said the fisherman. The king sat down
and wrote a letter to his queen: 'Cause this young man whom I send you
to be run through with a sword at once; he is a dangerous enemy of mine.
Let it be done before I return. Such is my will.' He then folded the
letter, fastened and sealed it with his signet.

Floatling started at once with the letter. He had to go through a great
forest, but missed the road and lost his way. He went from thicket to
thicket till it began to grow dark. Then he met an old hag, who said to
him: 'Whither are you going, Floatling?' 'I am going with a letter to
the king's palace, and have lost my way. Can't you tell me, mother, how
to get into the right road?" 'Anyhow, you won't get there to-day,' said
the hag; 'it's dark. Stay the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

night with me. You won't be with a stranger. I am your godmother.' The
young man allowed himself to be persuaded, and they hadn't gone many
paces when they saw before them a pretty little house, just as if it had
grown all at once out of the ground. In the night, when the lad was
asleep, the hag took the letter out of his pocket and put another in its
place, in which it was written thus: 'Cause this young man whom I send
you to be married to our daughter at once; he is my destined son-in-law.
Let it be done before I return. Such is my will.'

When the queen read the letter, she immediately ordered arrangements to
be made for the wedding, and neither she nor the young princess could
gaze enough at the bridegroom, so delighted were they with him; and
Floatling was similarly delighted with his royal bride. Some days after,
the king came home, and when he found what had happened, he was
violently enraged at his queen for what she had done. 'Anyhow, you
ordered me yourself to have him married to our daughter before you
returned,' answered the queen, and gave him the letter. The king took
the letter and looked it through--writing, seal, paper, everything was
his own. He had his son-in-law called, and questioned him about what had
happened on his way to the palace.

Floatling related how he had started and had lost his way in the forest,
and stayed the night with his old godmother. 'What did she look like?'
'So and so.' The king perceived from his statement that it was the same
person that had, twenty years before, assigned his daughter to the
charcoal-burner's son. He thought and thought, and then he said: 'What's
done can't be altered; still, you can't be my son-in-law for nothing. If
you want to have my daughter, you must bring me for a dowry three golden
hairs of Grand-father Allknow.' He thought to himself that he should
thus be quit of his distasteful son-in-law.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Floatling took leave of his bride and went--which way, and whither? I
don't know; but, as a Fate was his god-mother, it was easy for him to
find the right road. He went far and wide, over hills and dales, over
fords and rivers, till he came to a black sea. There he saw a boat, and
in it a ferryman. 'God bless you, old ferryman!' 'God grant it, young
pilgrim! Whither are you travelling?' 'To Grand-father Allknow, for
three golden hairs.' 'Ho, ho! I have long been waiting for such a
messenger. For twenty years I've been ferrying here, and nobody's come
to set me free. If you promise me to ask Grandfather Allknow when the
end of my work will be, I will ferry you over.' Floatling promised, and
the ferryman ferried him across.

After this he came to a great city, but it was decayed and sad. In front
of the city he met an old man, who had a staff in his hand, and could
scarcely crawl. 'God bless you, aged grandfather!' 'God grant it,
handsome youth! Whither are you going?' 'To Grandfather Allknow, for
three golden hairs.' 'Ah! ah! we've long been waiting for some such
messenger; I must at once conduct you to our lord the king.' When they
got there the king said: 'I hear that you are going on an errand to
Grandfather Allknow. We had an apple-tree here that bore youth-producing
apples. If anybody ate one, though he were on the brink of the grave, he
got young again, and became like a young man. But for the last twenty
years our apple-tree has produced no fruit. If you promise me to ask
Grandfather Allknow whether there is any help for us, I will requite you
royally.' Float-ling promised, and the king dismissed him graciously.

After that he came again to another great city, which was half ruined.
Not far from the city a son was burying his deceased father, and tears,
like peas, were rolling down his cheek. 'God bless you, mournful
grave-digger!' said Floatling. 'God grant it, good pilgrim! Whither are
you

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

going?' 'I am going to Grandfather Allknow, for three golden hairs.' 'To
Grandfather Allknow? It's a pity you didn't come sooner! But our king
has long been waiting for some such messenger; I must conduct you to
him.' When they got there, the king said: 'I hear that you are going on
an errand to Grandfather Allknow. We had a well here, out of which
sprang living water; if anybody drank it, even were he at the point of
death, he would get well at once; nay, were he already a corpse, if this
water were sprinkled upon him, he would immediately rise up and walk.
But for the last twenty years the water has ceased to flow. If you
promise me to ask Grandfather Allknow whether there is any help for us,
I will give you a royal reward.' Floatling promised, and the king
dismissed him graciously.

After this he went far and wide through a black forest, and in the midst
of that forest espied a large green meadow, full of beautiful flowers,
and in it a golden palace. This was Grandfather Allknow's palace; it
glittered as if on fire. Floatling went into the palace, but found
nobody there but an old hag sitting and spinning in a corner. 'Welcome,
Floatling said she; 'I am delighted to see you again.' It was his
godmother, at whose house he had spent the night when he was carrying
the letter. 'What has brought you here?' 'The king would not allow me to
be his son-in-law for nothing, so he sent me for three golden hairs of
Grand-father Allknow.' The hag smiled, and said: 'Grandfather Allknow is
my son, the bright Sun; in the morning he is a little lad, at noon a
grown man, and in the evening an old grandfather. I will provide you
with the three golden hairs from his golden head, that I too mayn't be
your godmother for nothing. But, my boy! you can't remain as you are. My
son is certainly a good soul, but when he comes home hungry in the
evening, it might easily happen that he might

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

roast and eat you for his supper. Yonder is an empty tub; I will cover
you over with it.' Floatling begged her also to question Grandfather
Allknow about the three things concerning which he had promised on the
road to bring answers. 'I will,' said the hag, 'and do you give heed to
what he says.'

All at once a wind arose outside and in flew the Sun, an old grandfather
with a golden head, by the west window into the room. 'A smell, a smell
of human flesh!' says he; have you anybody here, mother?' 'Star of the
day! whom could I have here without your seeing him? But so it is;
you're all day long flying over God's world, and your nose is filled
with the scent of human flesh; so it's no wonder that you still smell it
when you come home in the evening.' The old man said nothing in reply,
and sat down to his supper.

After supper he laid his golden head on the hag's lap and began to
slumber. As soon as she saw that he was sound asleep, she pulled out a
golden hair and threw it on the ground. It rang like a harp-string.
'What do you want, mother?' said the old man. 'Nothing, sonny, nothing!
I was asleep, and had a marvellous dream.' 'What did you dream about?'
'I dreamt about a city, where they had a spring of living water; when
anybody was ill and drank of it, he got well again; and if he died and
was sprinkled with this water, he came to life again. But for the last
twenty years the water has ceased to flow; is there any help that it may
flow again?' 'Quite easy; there's a toad sitting on the spring in the
well that won't let the water flow. Let them kill the toad and clean out
the well; the water will flow as before.' When the old man fell asleep
again, the hag pulled out a second golden hair and threw it on the
ground. 'What ails you again, mother?' 'Nothing, sonny, nothing; I was
asleep, and again had a marvellous dream. I dreamt of a

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

city where they had an apple-tree which bore youth-restoring apples;
when anybody grew old and ate one he became young again. But for the
last twenty years the apple-tree has borne no fruit; is there any help?'
'Quite easy; under the tree there lies a snake that exhausts its powers;
let them kill the snake and transplant the apple-tree; it will bear
fruit as before.' The old man then fell asleep again, and the hag pulled
out a third golden hair. 'Why won't you let me sleep, mother?' said the
old man crossly, and wanted to get up. 'Lie still, sonny, lie still!
Don't be angry, I didn't want to wake you. But a heavy sleep fell upon
me, and I had another marvellous dream. I dreamt of a ferryman on a
black sea; for twenty years he has been ferrying across it, and no one
has come to set him free. When will his work have an end?' 'He's the son
of a stupid mother. Let him give the oar into another person's hand and
jump ashore himself; the other will be ferryman in his stead. But let me
be quiet now; I must get up early to-morrow and go to dry the tears
which the king's daughter sheds every night for her husband, the
charcoal-burner's son, whom the king has sent for three golden hairs of
mine.'

In the morning a wind again arose outside, and on the lap of its old
mother awoke, instead of the old man, a beautiful golden-haired child,
the divine Sun, who bade farewell to his mother and flew out by the east
window. The hag turned up the tub and said to Floatling: 'There are the
three golden hairs for you, and you also know what Grandfather Allknow
has answered to those three things. Go; and good-bye! You will see me no
more; there is no need of it.' Floatling thanked the hag gratefully, and
departed.

When he came to the first city, the king asked him what news he brought
him. 'Good news,' said Floatling. 'Have the well cleaned out, and kill
the toad which sits on the spring, and the water will flow again as
aforetime.' The

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

king had this done without delay, and when he saw the water bubbling up
with a full stream, he presented Floatling with twelve horses white as
swans, and on them as much gold and silver as they could carry.

When he came to the second city the king asked him again what news he
brought. 'Good news!' said Floatling. 'Have the apple-tree dug up; you
will find a snake under the roots; kill it; then plant the apple-tree
again, and it will bear fruit as aforetime.' The king had this done at
once, and during the night the apple-tree was clothed with bloom, just
as if it had been bestrewn with roses. The king was delighted, and
presented Floatling with twelve horses as black as ravens, and on them
as much riches as they could carry.

Floatling travelled on, and when he came to the black sea, the ferryman
asked him whether he had learnt when he would be liberated. 'I have,'
said Floatling. 'But ferry me over first, and then I will tell you.' The
ferryman objected, but when he saw that there was nothing else to be
done, he ferried him over with his four-and-twenty horses. 'Before you
ferry anybody over again,' said Floatling, 'put the oar into his hand
and jump ashore, and he will be ferryman in your stead.'

The king didn't believe his eyes when Floatling brought him the three
golden hairs of Grandfather Allknow; and his daughter wept, not from
sorrow, but from joy at his return. 'But where did you get these
beautiful horses and this great wealth?' asked the king. 'I earned it,'
said Floatling; and related how he had helped one king again to the
youth-restoring apples, which make young people out of old ones; and
another to the living water, which makes sick

people well and dead people living. 'Youth-restoring apples! living
water!' repeated the king quietly to himself. 'If I ate one I should
become young again; and if I died I should be restored to life by that
water.' Without delay he

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

started on the road for the youth-restoring apples and the living
water--and hasn't returned yet.

Thus the charcoal-burner's son became the king's son-in-law, as the Fate
decreed; and as for the king, maybe he is still ferrying across the
black sea.

This story is a variant of Grimm's 'Giant with the Three Golden Hairs.'
But, whereas in Grimm there is nothing to indicate who the giant is, or
whether he has three golden hairs and three only, in the Bohemian tale
it is plain that 'Grandfather Allknow' is the Sun, and that the three
golden hairs are three sunbeams.
