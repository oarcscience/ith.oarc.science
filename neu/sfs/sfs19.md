# UPPER AND LOWER LUSATIAN STORIES.

THE Upper Lusatian language is spoken in a district which may be marked
by the towns of Löbau, Bautzen, and Muskau, while the Lower Lusatians
dwell round the towns of Spremberg and Kottbus. Of the Upper Lusatians
the larger portion live in Saxony and the smaller in Prussian territory;
the Lower Lusatians are all Prussian subjects.

The [Upper Lusatian story](sfs20.htm#an_14.md) illustrates, in folklore
style, a moral principle of great value. The [Lower Lusatian
tale](sfs21.htm#an_15.md) is a variant of our own 'Little Red Ridinghood.'
But it completes the story in such a manner as to explain the
allegorical meaning of the narrative in the sense in which I am inclined
to interpret it, as will be shown at the conclusion of the story.

But the Slavonic remnant in Lusatia is so surrounded by German
territory, that most of its folklore has already been pressed into the
service of the Germans.

A remarkable point in the Lusatian language is the completeness of the
dual number in both nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
