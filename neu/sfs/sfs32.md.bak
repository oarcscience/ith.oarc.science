### XXIII.--THE WONDERFUL BOYS.

A FATHER had three daughters; they went to the river to wash the linen.
The king's son rode up. One said: Well, if the king's son were to marry
me, I would hem the

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

whole palace round with a single needle.' The second said: 'If the
king's son were to marry me, I would feed the whole palace with a single
roll.' But the third said: 'If the king's son were to marry me, I would
bring him two sons, each with a moon on his head and a star on the nape
of his neck.' The king rode up to the one that said: 'I would bring him
two sons;' they lived one year, two years, and she was expecting to
become a mother. The king came and gave orders to her mother: 'Whatever
God gives my wife, let it be reared.' He rode away twenty miles off, and
God gave his wife children; she brought him two sons, each with a moon
on his head and a star on the nape of his neck. His wife wrote a letter,
that God had given them two sons, each with a moon on his head and a
star on the nape of his neck. A servant carried the letter to him, and
went in to stop the night at the house of the queen's sister, without
knowing that it was her sister. He lay down to sleep; then she took and
opened the letter, erased that which was written in it--'Each with a
moon on his head and a star on the nape of his neck '--and wrote
instead, that it was not a snake nor a lizard--it was nobody knew what,
that she had become the mother of. The man went to the king and
delivered the letter. He read it through: 'What God has given her, let
it not be destroyed without my orders.' He went back and again stopped
at the same place to pass the night; she took the letter again, opened
it, erased what the king had written, and wrote instead, that before he
returned, she was to bury her sons. When he arrived, the king's wife
read it through, and began to weep; she was grieved to bury those
beautiful sons. She dug two graves in the yard and buried them; out of
them grew two maples, a golden stem and a silver one. The king came to
the house and put her away because she had buried them without his
orders.

He rode off and married his wife's second sister. They lived together,
and after a time she said: 'My most illustrious husband! let us cut down
those maples and make ourselves a bed.'--'Ah! my most illustrious
husband! let us cut up that bed and burn it, and sprinkle the ashes on
the road.' A shepherd was driving sheep that way; a ewe strayed and
swallowed some of the ashes; she bore two he-lambs; on the head of each
was a moon, on the back of the neck a star. Then she disliked those
lambs, ordered them to be slaughtered, and the entrails to be thrown out
into the street. The first wife came out, collected the entrails, cooked
and ate them, and became the mother of two sons; each had a moon on his
head and a star on the nape of his neck. The two sons grew and grew, and
never took off their caps. Then the king had a desire that somebody
should come to tell him stories. People said that there were two
brothers there who could tell stories. They came to tell stories.

They began to tell a story. 'There was a king who had a queen; the queen
become the mother of two sons; on the head of each was a moon, on the
nape of the neck a star. Afterwards the king went hunting; the queen
wrote a letter and sent it. The man went to her sister's for the night;
she took the letter, opened it, and wrote that it was not a snake nor a
lizard--it was nobody knew what, that the queen had been the mother of.
The king read it through, and replied that it was to be reared, whether
it were a snake or a lizard. The man went homewards, and again rested at
the house where he had passed the night. She opened the letter, and
wrote that she was to bury it '*by my arrival*.' Then she dug two
holes--graves--and buried them; and two maples grew out, a golden stem
and a silver one. The new queen contrived that they should be cut down
and a bed made of them, and began to sleep on it,

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

and began to be uncomfortable: she ordered the bed to be cut up and
burnt, and the ashes to be thrown out into the yard. A shepherd was
driving sheep; a ewe swallowed some of the ashes and bore two he-lambs;
each had a moon on the head and a star on the back of the neck. The
queen ordered the lambs to be slaughtered, and their entrails to be
thrown out into the street. Her divorced sister went out into the
street, collected the entrails, took them to her house, cooked and ate
them, and became the mother of two sons; each had a moon on his head and
a star on the nape of his neck.' The boys bowed and took off their caps,
thus illuminating the whole room. The second wife was placed on an iron
harrow, and torn to pieces, but the king took his first wife, and they
began to live happily.
