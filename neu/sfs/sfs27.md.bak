### XIX.--THE PALE MAIDEN.

A PEASANT farmer in reduced circumstances had a beautiful daughter, whom
an old knight, the proprietor of the village, wanted to marry, and that
even by compulsion. But the damsel disliked him, and her parents also
refused to consent to the marriage. So the proprietor persecuted them in
every way in his power, and so oppressed them with forced labour and
ordered them to be beaten on the slightest occasion, that the poor
farmer could hold out no longer, but determined to remove from the
village with his whole family. In the cottage in which the farmer dwelt
there was something continually grating behind the stove, but though
they searched several times, and turned the seat constructed at the side
of the stove upside down, yet were they unable to discover aught. But
when, on the day of their departure, they were removing the rest of
their goods, they heard a more and more articulate grating, and whilst
they were impatiently listening, as the grating and scraping went on,
out of the stove sprang a thin pale form, like a buried maiden. 'What
the devil is this?' cried the father. 'For heaven's sake!' screamed the
mother, and all the children after her. 'I am no devil,' said the thin
pale maiden, but I am your Poverty. You are now taking yourselves off
hence, and you are bound to take me with you to your new abode.' The
poor householder was no fool; he bethought himself a little, and neither
seized nor throttled his Poverty, for she was so slight that he could
have done

nothing of any consequence to her, but he made the lowest possible
reverence to her, and said: 'Well, your gracious ladyship, if you are so
well satisfied amongst us, then come with us; but, as you see, we are
removing everything for ourselves, so help us to carry something, and we
shall get off the quicker.' Poverty agreed to this, and wanted to take a
couple of small vessels out of the house, but the house-holder
distributed the small vessels among his children to remove, and said
that there was still a block of wood in the yard which must also be
taken away. Going out into the yard, he made a cut in the block from
above with his axe. He then called Poverty, and politely requested her
to help him remove the block. Poverty did not see on which side to lift
the block, till, when the farmer pointed out the cleft to her, she put
her long thin fingers in the chink. The farmer, pretending to lift the
block on the other side, suddenly pulled his axe out of the cleft, and
Poverty's long thin fingers remained squeezed in the block, so that,
being utterly unable to pull them out, she shrieked out immediately in
what pain she was. But all in vain. The farmer removed all his goods as
well as his children, quitted the cottage completely, and returned to
the place no more.

When the farmer settled in another village, things went with him so
prosperously that ere long he was the richest man in the whole village;
he married his daughter to a respectable and wealthy farmer's son,
twenty years old, and the whole family prospered. On the other hand, the
proprietor of the first village, the oppressor of these poor people,
having to assign vacant cottages to fresh tenants, came to inspect the
cottage left vacant by the reduced farmer, who had refused to give him
his daughter. Seeing Poverty beside the block complaining of the pain of
her fingers, he took pity on the pale maiden, took her fingers out by
means of a wedge, and set her completely free.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> From the time of
her liberation the pale maiden never quitted the side of her liberator,
and when, moreover, the devil lit a fire in the old stove, and the
proprietor went dotty with love in his old age, he spent and spent, and
ran through everything that he had.
