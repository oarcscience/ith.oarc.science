# WHITE RUSSIAN STORIES.

WE now come to the first set of stories belonging to those Slavonians
who make use of the Cyrillic instead of the Latin characters. The White
Russians occupy the whole of the Governments of Minsk and Mogilef, and
great part of those of Vitebsk and Grodno. In these stories we first met
with the distinction between the Western and Eastern Slavonic terms for
monarch. The Western Slavonians employ the terms *kral*, *krul*, or
*korol*, for a monarch, which are believed to originate from the name of
the mighty Frankish monarch, KARL the Great, whom we generally know by
his French title, Charlemagne. The Eastern Slavonians usually make use
of the term TZAR, 'Emperor,' which is a corruption of the Latin 'Cæsar,'
the title of the emperors of Constantinople, and later of the Russian
emperors. Thus in the following stories we shall find emperors and
empresses generally, though not invariably, replacing kings and queens,
till we return again to the West.

The White Russian language possesses but little literature, but was
employed for diplomatic purposes by the once powerful state of Lithuania
(Morfill's 'Slavonic Literature,' S.P.C.K., p. 113).

The heroes 'Overturn-hill' (*Vertogor*) and 'Overturn-oak'

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*Vertodub*), who
appear in [No. 22](sfs31.htm#an_22.md), occur also in a story from the
Ukraine, given by Mr. Ralston (pp. 170-175). Several circumstances in
[No. 22](sfs31.htm#an_22.md) are also similar to incidents in the Russian
tale of 'Ivan Popyalof' (Ralston, p. 66), but in spite of these
similarities the stories are truly distinct.
