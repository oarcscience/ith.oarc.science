# KASHUBIAN STORY.

THE Kashubians inhabit a small district in the North-east of Pomerania,
'the province upon the sea,' from *po*, upon, and *more*, the sea. The
limits of the district may be roughly marked by the towns of Leba,
Lauenburg and Bütow or Bytom.

[The story](sfs23.htm#an_16.md) contains many of the circumstances of the
German story of 'The Table, the Ass and the Stick' in Grimm's
collection. The Kashubian tales again would naturally be pressed into
the service of the surrounding Germans. Bitter complaints have been made
by Slavonic literati, that their Folklore tales have been appropriated
by the Germans. Of course there is a vast amount of common ground in
Folklore, and incidents belonging to one tale will sometimes start up at
a distance in another apparently entirely unconnected with it. But I
believe that there is considerable ground for the complaint.
