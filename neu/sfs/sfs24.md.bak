# POLISH STORIES.

THE Polish language is one of great beauty and flexibility, but it is
disfigured by an orthography which causes English readers to imagine
that it is very difficult to pronounce, which is by no means the case.
The letter *z* in Polish performs the office frequently assigned to *h*
in English, viz., that of softening the preceding consonant without
possessing any further power of its own. Thus *cz* is the exact
equivalent in Polish of our *ch*, and *sz* exactly represents our *sh*.
The other grand peculiarities of the Polish language are the sibillated
*r*, written *rz*, the retention of the nasal sounds of long *a* (as
*on*) and long *e* (as *en* in French), and the dull *l* represented by
a curved stroke through the letter *l*, which has the sound of our final
*ll* in 'bull,' but is somewhat difficult to pronounce at the beginning
or in the middle of a word.

Poland, or rather Lithuania, the aristocracy of which is Polish, has
produced a really great poet, Mickiewicz, whose poems are so beautiful,
that it would be worth while for a literary person of leisure to study
the language for the mere purpose of reading them. See Morfill's
'Russia' (Sampson Low, 1880), pp. 207-272. One of the most celebrated of
Mickiewicz's poems, 'Pan Taddeus,' has lately been translated by Miss M.
A. Biggs (Trübner and Co.).

In the Polish story, [No. 17](sfs25.htm#an_17.md), we make acquaintance
with 'Kostchey the Deathless,' who plays a great part in Russian
stories, but is entirely unknown by name among the southern and most of
the western Slavonians. His place is with them taken by dragons and evil
shapes of various kinds. His name is probably derived from *kost*, a
'bone,' and I have ventured to Anglicize it accordingly. He is generally
supposed to symbolize winter, and certainly deciduous trees and bushes
then exhibit a very skeleton-like appearance. In a story from the
government of Perm, given by Mr. Ralston, the secret of his immortality
is discovered, and he is put to death accordingly. But I cannot help
inferring that his death is of annual occurrence, and that he resumes
his reign annually at the proper season, to be again put to death
towards spring. With [No. 18](sfs26.htm#an_18.md) several Russian tales
given by Mr. Ralston (pp. 185-193) may be compared. [No.
19](sfs27.htm#an_19.md) is a singular story of a more Oriental than
European cast, and [No. 20](sfs28.htm#an_20.md) reads as much like a dream
dreamed after the consumption of a considerable quantity of *vodka*, as
a genuine Folklore story. Such is also the case with several of Crofton
Croker's Legends of the south of Ireland.

Tale [No. 17](sfs25.htm#an_17.md) has already appeared in the 'Folklore
Journal' for January, 1884. For mere beauty of construction and
narration I doubt whether its equal can be found in any language.
