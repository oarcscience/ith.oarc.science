### LII.--KRALJEVITCH MARKO.

THERE was once upon a time a mother who gave birth to Kraljevitch Marko.
She reared him, and placed him in a position to become a hero. When
Marko was growing up he was obliged to feed swine, but he was then
weakly, and so dwarfish a lad that his comrades were able to beat him,
and wanted him to be a sort of servant for them and tend their swine.
But he was not willing to do this, so they beat him and lugged him by
the hair, so that he was obliged to run away from them. He got away, and
went into the fields, and there roamed about, thinking: 'They would be
beating me all day, now one, now another of them; but as it is, when I
go to them in the evening, they will only beat me once.' As he roamed
about, he came up to a baby. He saw that it was a handsome one, and that
it was lying in the sun. He made it a cool shade with branches, and went
a little way off and sat down. As he thus sat, up came a Vila, and said
to herself: 'Gracious God! who has done this? Let him ask me for
anything in the world; I will give it him.' He heard this, approached,
and said: 'Sister, I have done this for you.' 'You have done it, little
brother? Come! what do you ask of me in return, that I may reward you
for being so good as to make a cool shade for my baby?' 'Ah, dear
sister! what I should ask you, you could not give me.' 'Well, what is
such a mighty matter? only tell me.' He was thinking of this, that his
comrades might not beat him at the pasture; therefore he said that he
should

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

wish that they should not beat him. She replied: 'Well, if that is what
you wish for, come and suck my breast.' He obeyed her, went and sucked.
When he had finished sucking, the Vila said to him: 'Well, go now and
heave yon stone, and try whether you can heave it up.' The stone was
twelve hundredweight. He went to heave it, but could not stir it from
its place. Then the Vila said to him: 'Come and suck again; when you
have done sucking, go and heave it. He went to suck, and when he had
finished, went to heave it, but only lifted it a little. Then he went
again to suck, with such effect that he could already cast it a little
way. He went to suck once more. Then he was already able to cast it to a
great height and over hills, so that it was no more to be found. Once
more she bade him come to suck. He sucked his fill, and then she said to
him: 'Go now whithersoever you will; no one will beat you any more--no,
not your comrades.' He went merrily to the herdsmen, and they called to
him: 'Where have you been that we are obliged to tend your swine?' and
rushed upon him to beat him. He only waited for them. When they came up
to him, he seized one, knocked them down, and the one who was in his
hands was quite squashed, with such force had he taken hold of him. The
other shepherds, who saw what he did, ran to the home of those whom he
had knocked down, saying: 'Marko has knocked down your son, and
so-and-so's, and so-and-so's.' They all went to his mother: 'What manner
of son is this that you have reared up?--a brigand, who kills our
children!' She was terrified out of her wits, thinking what her son had
done. She began to revile him: 'Sonny, never did my eye see that you did
anything; wherefore do you thus to me, that other people come to revile
me because of your doings? Go! I shall be glad if my eye never sees you
more. Why do you put me to shame?' 'Well, then, good! if so you say, I
will

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

go into the world.' 'Only go that I may never see you.' 'Well, then,
good! go I will.'

He went. Now, he thought to himself: 'What shall I do? I am a hero, but
I have not what a hero requires.' Then he went to a smith, at whose
smithy were five-and-twenty smiths. 'God help you, smith!' 'God help
you, Kraljevitch Marko! why have you come to me?' 'I have come to you
that you may forge me a sword weighing twelve hundredweight; then you
shall also forge me a mace, if you make the sword well; but you must
know that it must he stronger than your anvil. If it cuts it through,
you shall receive payment; otherwise, not. Have you understood me?"
'Yes.' 'Well, then make it now.' All five-and-twenty smiths went
immediately and forged the sword. When it was ready, Marko came. 'Well,
smith, have you got it ready?' 'Yes, Marko.' 'Now come, let me see.'
Marko struck, but the sword broke into two pieces, and not the anvil.
'Ah! friend smith, you've not done it well; you get no pay.' He went on
to another smith. 'God help you, smith!' 'God help you, Kraljevitch
Marko! What work do you want done?' 'I have come to you to make me a
sword weighing twelve hundredweight, and to make it stronger than your
anvil, because, if it cuts through your anvil, you will receive payment;
if not, you will get nothing. Have you understood me?' 'Yes.' 'Then make
it.' Then up came the thirty smiths, worked at the sword, and worked
until they had finished forging it. Marko came: 'Well, smith, is the
sword ready?' 'It is, Marko.' 'Show it me that I may see it.' Marko took
it, struck, cut through the anvil, and cut right into the block. 'Well,
smith, you've made it well. Now that you've made me a sword, make me
also a sheath for the sword, and also a club, that is, a mace, weighing
twelve hundredweight, then I will pay you all at once. But when I throw
the mace, it must not break; if it

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

breaks, then you get no payment.' He made him a mace also, but did not
make it well. When Marko threw it, he let it fall upon himself, and the
mace broke. Then said Marko: 'You have made me the sword well, but not
the mace. Reach out your hand that I may pay you for the sword.' The
smith reached out his hand, and Marko cut it off with the sword, saying:
'There's your payment, smith, for the sword, that you may no more make
such swords for any hero.' Then he went to a third smith, with whom
thirty-eight smiths were at work, and said: 'God help you, smith!' 'God
requite you, Marko! why have you come to me?' 'I have come to you to
make me a club, that is, a mace, weighing twelve hundredweight; I tell
you the truth, if I throw it up on high, and it breaks when it falls,
you get no payment.' All thirty-eight smiths worked till they forged it.
Marko came: 'Well, is the mace ready?' 'It is, Marko.' 'Show it, that I
may see it.' When he gave it him, he threw it so high into the air that
it was three days and three nights in the sky. When it came down, Marko
presented his back; it fell upon him, and cast him to the ground, and
blood flowed from his nose and teeth, but the mace remained sound. But
Marko sprang up quickly, and said to the smith: 'Ah! dear smith! you've
made it well for me; reach out your hand that I may pay you.' He reached
out his hand to him, and he cut his hand off with his sword. 'Let this
be your payment, smith, that you may no more make such staves for any
hero.'

Then he went off to his mother and said to her: 'Mother, you see in me a
hero; if you revile me, I shall go about the world.' Then his mother
began to scold him: 'Why are you like this? Why don't you live like
other people? You have oxen; go, then, on to the green hill and plough
the fallows and pastures, and thereby support your old mother.' Marko
obeyed her, took the oxen, and went. But he didn't

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

go on to the green hill, to plough the fallows and pastures, but he went
and ploughed the emperor's highroads. When the Turks saw this, they went
to Marko--three hundred Turks, all chosen warriors--and said to him:
'Why, Marko, do you plough the emperor's highroads? you have the fallows
and pastures!' Then at him, to cut him down. When Marko saw this, he
hadn't with him either his sword or his mace, so seized his plough and
felled all three hundred Turks. Then said he: 'Ah! gracious God! a
wondrous hero!' Then he took the Turks' gold from them, left his plough,
unyoked the oxen, and turned them loose on the green hill: 'Go, little
oxen, on to the green hill, and feed and graze from pine to pine, like
the cuckoo Marko has not managed to plough with you, and now never will
he more.' And home he went singing: 'Here, mother, you have gold enough,
live upon it, and I will go into the world, that your eye may see me no
more.'

He took his mace and sword, went and came to an inn, where some Turks
were drinking red wine and conversing. We should be glad to make the
acquaintance of Kraljevitch Marko and see him. We have heard that he is
a celebrated hero. His brother Andro is in Stambol here. He is a hero,
but they say that *he* is a still greater hero.' 'In whose service is
Andro Kraljevitch?' 'In that of a pasha; he will soon come riding past
here.' 'Good; I will wait for him.' Up came Andro Kraljevitch, riding
with the pasha. Marko called out to him: 'Eh, adopted brother,
Kraljevitch Andro!' 'Thanks, unknown hero, perhaps you are Kraljevitch
Marko?' 'Quite true, I am Kraljevitch Marko.' 'Good; let us go into the
inn to drink a cup of wine, that love and the fortune of heroes may thus
unite us. Now we are not afraid of going into combat against any
empire.' So they went on the way to an inn. Kraljevitch Marko said:
'Prithee, sing me a song, Andro.' 'Dear brother, I

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

dare not. The Vila of the cloud would shoot me.' 'Don't be afraid; I am
here.' Andro obeyed, and sang so that all the branches began to fall.
All at once a spear flew against Andro and struck him down. Marko looked
about to see whence it came, and espied a Vila in the cloud; he seized
his mace and threw it at the Vila, so that it at once struck her to the
ground. The Vila began to shriek: 'Let me go, Marko! I will bring Andro
back to life, and will give you a wondrous horse, so that you will be
able to fly in the air.' Marko agreed, and she took certain grasses, and
brought Andro back to life. Marko obtained the wondrous horse, and both
rode off to an inn and drank red wine. But in the inn there was a wicked
harlot. She became enamoured of Andro, but he would not even look at
her. She therefore put sweet honey into his wine, that he might drink
the wine. Marko went out for a short time, and the wicked woman murdered
Andro. But when Marko came in he seized the wicked woman, and spitted
her on his sword: Take that, wretch, for murdering my brother Andro.'

He went on into the world. He roamed hither and thither, and when he met
with any hero, he tried the fortune of combat with him, as in his
encounter with black Arapin. Arapin built a tower beside the level sea.
When he had built it handsomely and raised it high, he said thus to it:
'Handsomely, my tower, handsomely have I built thee, and high have I
raised thee, for I have no father nor mother, no brother nor sister, nor
even my beloved, to walk about in thee. But I have a love, the daughter
of the emperor Soliman. I will write him the leaf of a white book, and
send up to him by a black Tatar; for if he will not give her to me, let
him meet me in single combat.' He wrote the leaf of a white book and
sent it by a black Tatar. When Soliman read over the leaf of the white
book, he shed tears abundantly, and his empress Solimanitza came to him
and

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

questioned him 'Why do you weep, emperor Soliman? Ofttimes have letters
come for you, and you have not shed abundant tears; what distress is
tormenting you?' He told her this, that black Arapin had written to him,
that, if he did not give him his daughter, he must meet him in single
combat; and how could he meet him in single combat? She advised him to
write the leaf of a white book to Kraljevitch Marko to come, promising
to give him three loads of money. He wrote the leaf of a white book and
sent it by a black Tatar. When Kraljevitch Marko read over the leaf of
the book, he began to laugh greatly: 'Yes, i’ faith, emperor Soliman!
what will your money do for me, if black Arapin severs my head from my
shoulders?' And he said not whether he would go or not go. The emperor
Soliman was anxiously expecting the Tatar, who brought to him the words,
that Marko neither said that he would come, nor that he would not come.
Thereupon the emperor was sorrowful, for he had no such man who would
deliver his daughter. There arrived a second letter from black Arapin,
that he must give him his daughter; if he did not give her, he must meet
him in single combat. As he read it, he shed abundant tears. Thereupon
his only daughter came to him and asked him: 'Why do you weep, emperor
Soliman? Letters have ofttimes arrived for you, and you have not shed
abundant tears.' He replied to her: 'Dear daughter! You see that black
Arapin writes to me, that, if I do not give you to him, I must meet him
in single combat; and how shall I, poor man that I am, meet him?' You
know, dear father, that there is one hero, Kraljevitch Marko. Write to
him, that you will give him nine loads of money, if he will come and
meet him in single combat.' The emperor Soliman wrote to Kraljevitch
Marko the leaf of a white book, and sent it to him by a black Tatar.
When he read over the leaf of the white book he laughed greatly:

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'I’ faith, emperor
Soliman! what will your money be to me, if black Arapin severs my head
from my shoulders?' Thereupon he did not say whether he would come or
not come. Sorrowful thereat, the emperor did not know what to do. Then
came a third letter from black Arapin, that he was coming, and that he
must prepare, would he, nould he, to give him his daughter, and that all
inns and shops must be shut for fear of him. Thereupon the emperor
Soliman shed abundant tears as he read it. His daughter came to him:
'Why do you weep, emperor Soliman? Letters have ofttimes arrived for
you, and you have not shed abundant tears. What distress is assailing
you?' 'You see, dear daughter, that black Arapin writes to me, that if I
don't give you to him, I must meet him in single combat! But how shall
I, poor man, meet him?' 'Write, dear father, to Kraljevitch Marko to
come, and offer him twelve loads of money, and a shirt which is neither
spun nor woven nor bleached, but made of nothing but pure gold, and a
serpent that holds a tray in its mouth, and on the tray a golden casket,
and in the casket a precious stone, by aid of which you can sup at
midnight just as well as at mid-day.' He wrote the leaf of a white book
and sent it to Kraljevitch Marko by a black Tatar, and offered him all
that his daughter told him. When Marko read the leaf of the white book,
he laughed greatly, and said: 'I’ faith, emperor Soliman! what will your
money do for me, if black Arapin severs my head from my shoulders?' And
then, too, he did not say that he would come or not come. Thereupon came
the leaf of a white hook from black Arapin, that Arapin had now got
ready three hundred heroes, all in silver armour, and all chosen
warriors. Then said Kraljevitch Marko to his piebald horse: 'Eh! piebald
horse, my pearl! you know well that you must be faithful to me, for, if
not, I shall cut off your feet at the knees, and

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

that you must bear yourself valiantly.' And the piebald horse replied
that he must saddle and mount with speed to go soon, and that black
Arapin was already near. Marko saddled and mounted him, and went to the
city where the emperor Soliman reigned.

Now, when he had ascertained by which road Arapin's men were coming, he
presented himself to a young inn-keeper, and said, knocking at the door:
'Open, and bring some wine.' But he excused himself, saying that he
dared not draw any, for all inns and shops were obliged to be shut for
fear of black Arapin. But the hero said to him: 'You must bring some for
me, or I shall cleave your head to the shoulders.' The innkeeper saw
that it could not be otherwise, and was obliged to bring him a cup of
wine. Marko drank half; and gave half to his piebald horse. Then he
brought two cups, one for Marko, and one for the horse. Meanwhile, Marko
went into the garden to look about him. When he got there, he saw by the
side of a brook a damsel In sorrow, and wondered what ailed her that she
wept so piteously, saying: 'Ah! my rivulet! I would rather abide in you,
than lie behind black Arapin's back.' When Marko saw that it was
Soliman's daughter, he said: What ails you, damsel, that you weep so
piteously?' She replied to him: 'Go hence, unknown hero! As to what you
ask me, you cannot aid me.' 'Now, only tell me; maybe I shall aid you.'
'Black Arapin will come, and will take me away from my father and
mother; but I had a man, who could have set me free, but he will not. I
offered him twelve loads of money, and a shirt, which is neither spun
nor bleached, but is made of pure gold; and a serpent, that holds in its
mouth a tray, and on the tray a golden casket, and in the casket a
precious stone, by aid of which he could sup at midnight, as well as at
mid-day; but he won't. The sun has not seen him, neither has the moon
thrown its light

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

upon him, nor has he seen his mother more, nor has a bird sung to him.'
Marko answered her: 'Don't chatter, don't chatter; but go and say that I
have arrived. I am Marko; and let him dress and furnish you handsomely,
and give you all that is requisite for Arapin, and all that he shall
desire.' Then she ran to her father, and told him all that Marko said.
Meanwhile, while Marko was conversing with the damsel, Arapin arrived,
saw an inn open, and a horse in front of it standing tethered at the
entrance. He said: 'Who is this, that is not afraid of my terror?' And
thereupon he said that he would soon teach him to be afraid of him.
After this, he shouted an order to the bedelija; the bedelija (such is
the \[Turkish\] name for a horse) would not stir. 'Well, I'll go
thither; I won't make quarrels; maybe I shall obtain possession of the
damsel without any disturbance.' And, in fact, thither he went, obtained
possession of the damsel, and all that he needed was given him. Then he
went again to the inn, and saw the horse again standing there. Again he
was about to go to the innkeeper to slay him; but he shouted to the
horse, the horse wouldn't stir. Said Arapin: 'Well, I won't make
quarrels, now that I have obtained the damsel without any quarrel.' When
Arapin proceeded on his way, Marko came out of the garden, and his
piebald horse said to him: 'Where have you been so long, that Arapin
might easily have killed me?" 'Now don't fear, my piebald; we shall soon
kill him, please God, not he you.' Then he called for one more cup of
wine for himself, and one for his piebald. When they had finished
drinking, they started on their way, and in pursuit of Arapin. Arapin
had already told his chief officer to look round to see whether any dark
fog came out behind them. He looked round, but saw nothing. But when he
afterwards looked round a second time, he espied a dark fog, and said to
Arapin: 'Yes, my lord, a dark foul fog is coming behind

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

us.' Scarcely had he said this, when Marko attacked, and began to
slaughter, his rearguard. Arapin said to him: Don't be silly, Marko; why
are you playing the fool with us? I don't know whether you are jesting,
or playing the fool.' 'I am neither jesting nor playing the fool, but am
in earnest.' 'Do, then, what you can; throw what you have.' 'I won't;
but throw you your mace.' Marko's piebald threw himself down, and
Arapin's mace went over Marko's head. Then Marko threw his mace, and
felled Arapin to the ground, and the piebald leapt to Arapin, and said
to Marko: 'Come, see that you cut off Arapin's head.' When the piebald
leapt, Marko, too, struck with his sword, and cut off Arapin's head, and
the piebald quickly leapt backwards thirty paces. Then he left Arapin's
carcase on the ground, gave the head to the damsel, and said: 'Kiss him,
now that he is dead, though you wouldn't when he was living.' They went
home, and the emperor caused a great entertainment to be prepared, and
all Marko's friends, and his father and mother, to be invited, and Marko
obtained his promised reward.

So, too, he tried the fortune of combat with Musa Urbanusa. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[\*](#fn_18.md) He had three hearts. Marko fought with
him for three nights and three white days without cessation, so that red
foam already issued from Marko, while not even white foam came from Musa
Urbanusa. Then Kraljevitch Marko shouted: 'Eh! sister Vila!' The Vila
replied: 'I cannot help you, because the baby has fallen asleep in my
arms; but don't you know your secret weapon?' Then said Kraljevitch
Marko: 'Look, Musa Urbanusa, whether the sun is now rising or setting.'
Musa looked at the sun, and Marko drew his knife, and ripped Musa up.
Musa seized hold of him so powerfully that he barely dug his way out
from under Musa, whom he had ripped up. There he

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

lay, and Marko pushed himself sideways, and when he had extricated
himself, went to look what there was in this man that was so strong. He
saw that Musa had three hearts, one was beating, the second was
beginning to beat a little, and the third did not yet know aught about
it. On the third he saw a snake lying, and the snake said to Marko:
Thank God that I didn't know of it; you wouldn't have done what you have
done. But open your mouth, Marko, that I may enter into you, that you,
too, may be as strong as he was.' Marko became angry, and cut the snake
to pieces, saying: 'I don't need such a foul creature as you are.'

Then he proceeded on his way, and went about till firearms were
invented. He went up to a shepherd, who was shooting birds. Then Marko
asked him: 'What's this that you are doing?' 'Eh! you see, I'm shooting
birds; and I could shoot you, also.' 'And how would you kill me with
this thing? Heroes have not killed me; could you do so?' Then he reached
his hand to him, and said: 'Shoot into my hand here.' He shot, and shot
through his hand. Then said Marko: 'It is not worth my while to live any
longer in the world; now any cuckoo could slay me; I had rather quit
it.' He went into a cavern, and lives there still at the present day.
Into this cavern a man was compelled to go, who was let down by a rope
in a chest. When he arrived within, the Vila immediately stepped up to
him, and said: 'Christian soul, why come you here?' He told her why and
how. But Marko heard that somebody was conversing, and immediately asked
the Vila who it was that had come in. She told him that a soul from that
world had come to see what was in the cavern. Marko immediately said
that he must come to him, that he might see how strong people in the
world still were, and he must give him his hand. But she gave him a
red-hot iron, and Marko took it, and squeezed it in his hands so that
water spirted out of it, and

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

said: 'Ah, ah I could still live in the world if no one would talk about
me for three days.' He also commissioned him to tell the lords that he
should come there. He gave him a letter, too, and sealed it with his own
hand, and allowed him to go up. He shook the rope, and got into the
chest. Then they pulled him up, and he gave the letter to the lords;
but, for fear of Marko's coming, the lords did not make the letter
public for people to know how Marko had gone into the cavern. The
footprints of his horse are still recognised.
