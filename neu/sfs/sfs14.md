# HUNGARIAN-SLOVENISH STORIES.

THE Slovenes or Slovaks of North Hungary speak a great number of
dialects, their literary language being, however, the Bohemian. They
seem to be the *débris* of a much larger nation or assemblage of
nations, which was forced out of the plains of Pannonia into the
mountains by the invasion of the Magyar or Hungarian horsemen, who,
according to the Russian chronicler Nestor, marched past Kief in A.D.
898, on their way to establish themselves in their present abode.

Their stories are not very dissimilar to the Bohemian tales, although
they do not resemble them so closely as the Moravian stories do. [No.
10](sfs15.htm#an_10.md) is one of the tales that especially attracted my
attention, and caused me to entertain the idea of translating a
considerable selection out of the hundred given by Erben. [No.
11](sfs16.htm#an_11.md) contains incidents which occur again in the White
Russian story ([No. 22](sfs31.htm#an_22).md), and in the great Russian tale
of 'Ivan Popyalof,' given by Ralston, though in other respects the
stories are very different. [No. 22](sfs31.htm#an_22.md) is a superior
variant of the German 'Rumpelstilskin' given by Grimm, and [No.
13](sfs18.htm#an_13.md) is a specimen of an entirely different kind of
story, illustrating 'The biter bitten.'
