# SERBIAN STORIES FROM BOSNIA.

THE Bosnian stories are not written in the Cyrillic, but in the Latin
character. This indicates that the Christian inhabitants of Bosnia
belong to the Latin rather than to the Greek Church. The Serbians of the
Kingdom of Serbia would, no doubt, gladly absorb Bosnia, but it is very
doubtful whether the Bosnians would be equally glad to be absorbed by
them. In Bosnia the landed proprietors are extensively Mahometans, and
neither they nor the Latin Christians would be very willing to place
themselves under the domination of the Orthodox Greek Church, without
much stronger guarantees than the Serbians of the kingdom, as at present
constituted, are likely to be able or willing to give them.
