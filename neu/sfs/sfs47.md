# BULGARIAN STORIES.

THE Bulgarians do not derive their name from a Slavonic origin, but from
a small and warlike nation of horsemen, which in A.D. 679 crossed the
Danube under a chief named Isperich, conquered the disunited Slavonic
tribes that had settled in Mœsia, and consolidated them into a powerful
realm. The conquerors melted into the conquered, and lost their
language, but gave their name to the state and country. The Slavonic
language of the people does not appear to have been affected by that of
their Ugrian conquerors, but rather by the old Thracian language, which,
conjointly with Latin, has produced the present Roumanian. The
peculiarities of the present Bulgarian language are: (1) the loss of
case-inflexions in nouns and adjectives, while the verbal system is most
complete and complex; (2) the expression of the genitive and dative
cases by prefixing the preposition *na*; (3) the post-positive article,
which is also borrowed from the old Thracian language, which was akin to
the Illyrian now spoken by the present Albanians and Epirots; (q) the
loss of the infinitive mood, which is replaced by *da* with the finite
verb. Baron Wenceslas Wratislaw, in describing his journey through
Bulgaria in 1591, says of the people: They use a Slavonic language, so
that we Bohemians can converse with them.'

The Bulgarian tales themselves are curious, and some of them very
beautiful, as are also the songs, to which considerable space is devoted
by Mr. Morfill in his 'Slavonic Literature' (pp. 125-144). There are old
traditions as to the world and its inhabitants, apparently of heathen
origin ([No. 35](sfs48.htm#an_35).md) a singular fusion of the history of
Abraham and Isaac with some other, probably heathen, tradition ([No.
36](sfs49.htm#an_36).md); a version of 'Cinderella' ([No.
37](sfs50.htm#an_37).md), which, involving as it does the transmigration of
souls, clearly exhibits an Indian origin; a beautiful story ([No.
38](sfs51.htm#an_38).md), the latter part of which is a variant of the
latter part of the Russian tale of 'Marya Morevna' (Ralston, p. 85), and
[No. 39](sfs52.htm#an_39.md), in the latter part of which many people will
recognise a variant of an old acquaintance.
