# SERBIAN STORIES.

THE Serbian is the most widely spread of the South Slavonic dialects,
being spoken not only in Serbia proper, but also in Bosnia, Herzegovina,
Croatia, Carniola, and a great part of South Hungary. It has, like the
Bulgarian, been affected by the old Thracian language, but not to the
same extent. The infinitive is very frequently represented by *da* with
the finite verb. Szafarzik includes the whole of the South Slavonic
dialects, except the Bulgarian, under the common name 'Illyrian,' and
subdivides them into the three divisions of Serbian, Croatian, and
Carinthian-Slovenish.

The Serbian stories are generally good, particularly [No.
40](sfs54.htm#an_40), which may be compared with a very inferior variant
in Grimm, 'The Golden Bird.' [No. 40](sfs54.htm#an_40) is one of the
stories, the beauty of which set me to work upon the present series of
translations. In it is to be noticed the *pobratimstvo*, or adoptive
brotherhood, which plays so important a part in Serbian life, and of
which we have just had a glimpse in the Bulgarian story, [No.
38](sfs51.htm#an_38). [No. 43](sfs57.htm#an_43) is a very good story,
containing novel and interesting incidents. In [No. 44](sfs58.htm#an_44)
it must be observed that 'Fate' is represented as a man, for the
converse reason to that for which Death is represented as a woman in the
Moravian story, [No. 8](sfs12.htm#an_08).

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Usud* (Fate) is
masculine, while *Smrt* (Death) is feminine in Slavonic.

The Serbs possess actual epic poetry, of which an account is given by
Mr. Morfill ('Slavonic Literature,' pp. 154-162).
