### XLVI.--THE TWO BROTHERS.

THERE was a man who had a wife but no sons, a female hound but no
puppies, and a mare but no foal. 'What in the world shall I do?' said he
to himself. 'Come, let me go away from home to seek my fortune in the
world, as I haven't any at home.' As he thought, so he did, and went out
by himself into the white world as a bee from flower to flower. One day,
when it was about dinner-time, he came to a spring, took down his
knapsack, took out his provisions for the journey, and began to eat his
dinner. Just then a traveller appeared in front of him, and sat down
beside the spring to rest; he invited him to sit down by him that they
might eat together. When they had inquired after each other's health and
shaken hands, then the second corner asked the first on what business he
was travelling about the world. He said to him: 'I have no luck at home,
therefore I am going from home; my wife has no children, my hound has no
puppies, and my mare has never had a foal; I am going about the white
world as a bee from flower to flower.' When they had had a good dinner,
and got up to travel further, then the one who had arrived last thanked
the first for his dinner, and offered him an apple, saying: 'Here is
this apple for you '--if I am not mistaken it was a Frederic
pippin--'and return home at once; peel the apple and give the peel to
your hound and mare; cut the apple in two, give half to your wife to
eat, and eat the other half yourself. What has hitherto been
unproductive will hence-forth be productive. And as for the two pips
which you will find in the apple, plant them on the top of your house.'
The man thanked him for the apple; they rose up and parted, the one
going onwards and the other back to his house. He peeled the apple and
did everything as the other had instructed him. As time went on his wife
became

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

the mother of two sons, his hound of two puppies, and his mare of two
foals, and, moreover, out of the house grew two apple-trees. While the
two brothers were growing up, the young horses grew up, and the hounds
became fit for hunting. After a short time the father and mother died,
and the two sons, being now left alone like a tree cut down on a hill,
agreed to go out into the world to seek their fortune. Even so they did:
each brother took a horse and a hound, they cut down the two
apple-trees, and made themselves a spear apiece, and went out into the
wide world. I can't tell you for certain how many days they travelled
together; this I do know, that at the first parting of the road they
separated. Here they saw it written up: 'If you go by the upper road you
will not see the world for five years; if you go by the lower road, you
will not see the world for three years.' Here they parted, one going by
the upper and the other by the lower road. The one that went by the
lower road, after three years of travelling through another world, came
to a lake, beside which there was written on a post: 'If you go in, you
will repent it; if you don't go in, you will repent it.' If it is so,'
thought he to himself, 'let me take whatever God gives,' and swam across
the lake. And lo! a wonder! he, his horse, and his hound were all gilded
with gold. After this he speedily arrived at a very large and spacious
city. He went up to the emperor's palace and inquired for an inn where
he might pass the night. They told him, up there, yon large tower, that
was an inn. In front of this tower he dismounted; servants came out and
welcomed him, and conducted him into the presence of their master in the
courtyard. But it was not an innkeeper, but the king of the province
himself. The king welcomed and entertained him handsomely. The next day
he began to prepare to set forth on his journey. The evening before, the
king's only daughter, when she saw him go in front of her apartments,

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

had observed him well, and fixed her eyes upon him. This she did because
such a golden traveller had never before arrived, and consequently she
was unable to close her eyes the whole night. Her heart thumped, as it
were; and it was fortunate that the summer night was brief, for if it
had been a winter one, she could hardly have waited for the dawn. It all
seemed to her and whirled in her brain as if the king was calling her to
receive a ring and an apple; the poor thing would fly to the door, but
it was shut and there was nobody at hand. Although the night was a short
one, it seemed to her that three had passed one after another. When she
observed in the morning that the traveller was getting ready to go, she
flew to her father, implored him not to let that traveller quit his
court, but to detain him and to give her to him in marriage. The king
was good-natured, and could easily be won over by entreaties; what his
daughter begged for, she also obtained. The traveller was detained and
offered marriage with the king's daughter. The traveller did not
hesitate long, kissed the king's hand, presented a ring to the maiden,
and she a handkerchief to him, and thus they were betrothed. Methinks
they did not wait for publication of banns. Erelong they were wedded;
the wedding feast and festival were very prolonged, but came to an end
in due course. One morning after all this the bridegroom was looking in
somewhat melancholy fashion down on the country through a window in the
tower. His young wife asked him what ailed him? He told her that he was
longing for a hunt, and she told him to take three servants and go while
the dew was still on the grass. Her husband would not take a single
servant, but mounting his gilded horse and calling his gilded hound,
went down into the country to hunt. The hound soon found scent, and put
up a stag with gilded horns. The stag began to run straight for a tower,
the hound after him, and the hunter after the

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

hound, and he overtook the stag in the gate of the courtyard, and was
going to cut off its head. He had drawn his sword, when a damsel cried
through the window: 'Don't kill my stag, but come upstairs: let us play
at draughts for a wager. If you win, take the stag; if I win, you shall
give me the hound.' He was as ready for this as an old woman for a
scolding match, went up into the tower, and on to the balcony, staked
the hound against the stag, and they began to play. The hunter was on
the point of beating her, when some damsels began to sing: 'A king, a
king, I've gained a king!' He looked round, she altered the position of
the draughtsmen, beat him and took the hound. Again they began to play a
second time, she staking the hound and he his horse. She cheated him the
second time also. The third time they began to play, she wagered the
horse, and he himself. When the game was nearly over, and he was already
on the point of beating her, the damsels began to sing this time too,
just as they had done the first and second times. He looked round, she
cheated and beat him, took a cord, bound him, and put him in a dungeon.

The brother, who went by the upper road, came to the lake, forded it,
and came out all golden--himself; his horse, and his hound. He went for
a night's lodging to the king's tower; the servants came out and
welcomed him. His father-in-law asked him whether he was tired, and
whether he had had any success in hunting; but the king's daughter paid
special attention to him, frequently kissing and embracing him. He
couldn't wonder enough how it was that everybody recognised him;
finally, he felt satisfied that it was his brother, who was very like
him, that had been there and got married. The king's daughter could not
wonder enough, and it was very distressing to her, that her
newly-married husband was so soon tired of her, for the more
affectionate she was to him, the more did he repulse

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

her. When the morrow came, he got ready to go out to look for his
brother. The king, his daughter, and all the courtiers, begged him to
take a rest. 'Why,' said they to him, you only returned yesterday from
hunting, and do you want to go again so soon?' All was in vain; he
refused to take the thirty servants whom they offered him, but went down
into the country by himself. When he was in the midst of the country,
his hound put up a stag, and he after them on his horse, and drove it up
to a tower; he raised his sword to kill the stag, but a damsel cried
through a window: 'Don't meddle with my stag, but come upstairs that we
may have a game at draughts, then let the one that wins take off the
stakes, either you my hound, or I yours.' When he went into the
basement, in it was a hound and a horse--the hounds and horses
recognised each other--and he felt sure that his brother had fallen into
prison there. They began the game at draughts, and when the damsel saw
that he was going to beat her, some damsels began to sing behind them:
'A king! a king! I've gained a king!' He took no notice, but kept his
eye on the draughtsmen; then the damsel, like a she-devil, began to make
eyes and wink at the young man. He gave her a flip with his coat behind
the ears: 'Play now!' and thus beat her. The second game they both
staked a horse. She couldn't cheat him; he took both the hound and the
horse from her. The third and last time they played, he staking himself
and she herself; and after giving her a slap in her face for her winking
and making of eyes, he won the third game. He took possession of her,
brought his brother out of the dungeon, and they went to the town.

Now the brother, who had been in prison, began to think within himself:
'He was yesterday with my wife, and who knows whether she does not
prefer him to me?' He drew his sword to kill him, but the draught-player
defended him.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He darted before
his brother into the courtyard, and as he stepped on to the passage from
the tower, his wife threw her arms round his neck and began to scold him
affectionately for having driven her from him overnight, and conversed
so coldly with her. Then he repented of having so foolishly suspected
his brother, who had, moreover, released him from prison, and of having
wanted to kill him; but his brother was a considerate person and forgave
him. They kissed each other and were reconciled. He retained his wife
and her kingdom with her, and his brother took the draught-player and
her kingdom with her. And thus they attained to greater fortune than
they could ever have even hoped for.
