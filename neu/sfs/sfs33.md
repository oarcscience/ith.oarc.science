# LITTLE RUSSIAN STORIES.

### (FROM GALICIA.)

MR. RALSTON does not seem to have been directly acquainted with these
tales; at any rate, none of them are given in either his book of Russian
folk-tales or in that of Russian songs. It is, therefore, the more
necessary for me to supplement his admirable work by giving all the
Galician stories in Erben's collection.

The Little Russians, or Ruthenians, form the bulk of the population in
the Austrian province of Galicia, formerly the principality of Halicz,
and also designated 'Red Russia.' The capital is Lemberg (contracted
from Löwenberg), or Lvóv. They are also found in the adjoining parts of
the north of Hungary, and in the Bukovina.

I think that the present selection is the first introduction of the
literature of the Austrian Russians to the notice of the British reader.

The prophet Elijah (*Ilya*) is a very important and powerful personage
in Russian folklore, and we find him accordingly in [No.
27](sfs37.htm#an_27.md) holding a prominent position in the heavenly
hierarchy, even before the creation of man! He seems to have taken the
place of Perun, the god of thunder, among the heathen Slavonians.

I must also draw attention to the extreme stupidity of the

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

'devils' of Slavonic folklore. They are still less intelligent than
their Teutonic brethren, and do not appear to have any connection with
the Arch Enemy, but to be, as Mr. Ralston says (p. 370), rather 'the
lubber fiends of heathen mythology, beings endowed with supernatural
might, but scantily provided with mental power.' [No.
26](sfs36.htm#an_26.md) gives a specimen of their average intelligence.
