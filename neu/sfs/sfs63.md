### XLVII.--THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

IN the beginning there was nothing but God, and God slept and dreamed.
For ages and ages did this dream last. But it was fated that he should
wake up. Having roused himself from sleep, he looked round about him,
and every glance transformed itself into a star. God was amazed, and
began to travel, to see what he had created with his eyes. He travelled
and travelled, but nowhere was there either end or limit. As he
travelled, he arrived at our earth also; but he was already weary; sweat
clung to his brow. On the earth fell a drop of sweat: the drop became
alive, and here you have the first man. He is God's kin, but he was not
created for pleasure: he was produced from sweat; already in the
beginning it was fated for him to toil and sweat.
