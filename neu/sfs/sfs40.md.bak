### XXIX.--THE SNAKE AND THE PRINCESS.

THERE was an emperor and empress who had three daughters. The emperor
fell ill, and sent his eldest daughter for water. She went to fetch it,
when a snake said: 'Come! will you marry me?' The princess replied: 'No,
I won't.' 'Then,' said he, 'I won't give you any water.' Then the second
daughter said: 'I'll go; he'll give me some.' She went; the snake said
to her: 'Come! will you marry me?' 'No,' she said, 'I won't.' He gave
her no water. She returned and said: 'He gave me no water. He said: "If
you will marry me I will give it."' The youngest said: 'I will go; he
will give me some.' She went, and the snake said to her: 'Come! will you
marry me?' 'I will,' she said. Then he drew her water from the very
bottom, cold and fresh. She brought it home, gave it her father to
drink, and her father recovered. Then on Sunday a carriage came, and
those with it said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'Open the door,  
     Princess!  
Why did the dear one love?  
Why draw water from the ford,  
     Princess?'</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> She was terrified,
wept, and went and opened the door. Then they said again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'Open the rooms,  
     Princess!  
Why did the dear one love?  
Why draw water from the ford,  
     Princess?'</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then they came
into the house and placed the snake in a plate on the table. There he
lay, just as if he were of gold! They went out of the house, and said:

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'Sit in the carriage,  
     Princess!  
Why did the dear one love?  
Why draw water from the ford,  
     Princess?'</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They drove off
with her to the snake's abode. There they lived, and had a daughter born
to them. They also took a godmother to live with them, but she was a
wicked woman. The child soon died, and the mother died soon after it.
The godmother went in the night to the place where she was buried, and
cut off her hands. Then she came home, and heated water-gruel, scalded
the hands, and took off the gold rings. Then the princess--such was the
ordinance of God--came to her for the hands, and said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'The fowls are asleep, the geese are asleep,  
Only my godmother does not sleep.  
She scalds white hands in water-gruel,  
She takes off golden rings.'</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The godmother
concealed herself under the stove. She said again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'The fowls are asleep, the geese are asleep,  
Only my godmother does not sleep.  
She scalds white hands in water-gruel,  
She takes off golden rings.'</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The next day they
came and found the godmother dead under the stove. They didn't give her
proper burial, but threw her into a hole.
