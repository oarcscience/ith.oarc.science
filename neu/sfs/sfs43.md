### XXXII.--THE WIZARD.

THERE was here once in our village a certain Avstriyat, who was such a
wizard that he could cause rain or hail to pass away when he chose. It
happened that we were cutting corn in the country; a cloud came up. We
began to hurry off the sheaves, but he took no notice, cut and cut away
by himself, smoked his pipe, and said: 'Don't be frightened--there'll be
no rain.' Lo and behold, there was no rain. Once--all this I saw with my
own eyes--we were cutting rye, when the sky became black, the wind rose:
it began to

whistle at first afar off, then over our very heads. There was thunder,
lightning, whirlwind--such a tempest, that--O God! Thy will be done! We
went after our sheaves, but he--'Don't be frightened, there'll be no
rain.' 'Where won't it be?' We didn't hearken to him. But he smoked his
pipe out, and cut away quietly by himself. Up came a man on a black
horse, and all black himself: he darted straight up to Avstriyat: 'Hey!
give permission!' said he. Avstriyat replied: 'No, I won't!' 'Give
permission; be merciful!' 'I won't. It would be impossible to get such a
quantity in.' The black horseman bowed to the man, and hastened off over
the country.

Then the black cloud became gray and whitened. Our elders feared that
there would be hail. But Avstriyat took no notice. He cut the corn by
himself and smoked his pipe. But again a horseman came up; he hastened
over the country still quicker than the first. But this one was all in
white, and on a white horse. 'Give permission he shouted to Avstriyat.
'I won't!' 'Give permission, for God's sake!' 'I won't. It wouldn't be
possible to get such a quantity in.' 'Hey! give permission; I can't hold
out! Then, and not till then, did Avstriyat relent. 'Well, then, go now,
but only into the glen, which is beyond the plain.' Scarcely had he
spoken, when the horseman disappeared, and hail poured down as out of a
basket. In the course of a short hour it filled the glen brimful, level
with the banks.
