# INTERESTING THINGS

### THE TINY HISTORY OF THE BALTIC SEA

### Pirate Days

RING! RING! RING! TOLL! TOLL! TOLL! The alarm bells were ringing, over
twelve hundred years ago; along the east coast of Britain they were
ringing and tolling. The Baltic Pirates were coming.

The British children, and their fathers and mothers saw the long,
gilded, dragon-prowed pirate-ships come flashing through the billows of
the North Sea. Painted ships they were, high-pooped, each with a
spreading square sail and oars that dipped and rose and dipped again.
Shields hung along the bulwarks; swords, spears and axes bristled on the
decks. The stiff gale blew the Pirates' flowing red or blond beards and
tossing locks. Helmets shone, birnies glittered, and icy blue eyes
gleamed. Gigantic, huge-limbed, bold, were the heathen Pirates from the
Baltic Sea, shouting praises to their gods, Thor and Odin. Vikings we
call those Pirates.

And when the British children and women saw them coming, they ran about
hunting for places in which to hide. The British men got out their pikes
to defend their homes and children.

And after the Pirates' raid was over and the British homes lay sacked
and smoking in ashes, back across the North Sea, through the winding
channels into the Baltic, sailed the Vikings, their ships laden with
rich booty. To the lands of Denmark or Sweden, or to the coast of the
Saxons and Angles, the Vikings sailed their ships and anchored in
home-harbors, till ready for another raid. Many were the raids made
during hundreds of years.

And the Vikings themselves had to watch for Pirates. For there were
Rovers on the Baltic, in those days, who preyed on the Vikings. From
time to time brave red-haired Finns fell upon the coast towns and
villages of Sweden, and made many a successful raid.

In those far-away days, the lands encircling the Baltic, were swarming
with countless heathen Tribes of different races. The lands could
scarcely feed them all. And the desire for bold adventures, for booty,
for battle, for new homes in strange lands--with broad acres, plenty to
eat, and a chance to rule--was strong upon the restless, fierce folk of
the Baltic.

### The Moving Hordes

IN those tumultuous days, the Baltic was not merely a protecting haven
for Pirates. From its swarming beehive of peoples, went forth Tribes and
Tribes and Tribes again migrating southward till at last they
overwhelmed the mighty Roman Empire.

And from the Baltic shores sailed Saxons, Angles, and Danes who founded
England in the British Isles. And in later days, English descendants of
those same Baltic conquerors, crossed the Atlantic and helped colonize
North America.

To go back to those far-off times of the Vikings, the peoples who did
not leave their homes on the Baltic shores, but stayed to build cities,
towns, and fleets of ships, became strong nations. Hundreds of years
passed, and, in the Middle Ages, the Baltic was a centre of world
commerce.

### The Great Amber Sea

AND the Baltic is the Amber Sea.

Long, long ago, at the dawn of history, before the Birth of Christ, the
Ancient Greeks used to buy a mysterious, beautiful substance, hard,
light to lift, transparent like honey-drops, or of a milky yellow or
clear, rich, red-brown color.

When they rubbed the substance, forth came a curious fragrance. When
they burned it, up shot bright flames with a pleasant odor. And when
they rubbed it again, lo! it was charged with an energy like that of the
lodenstone, attracting objects to it. They were making the first
electrical experiments, those Ancient Greeks, but they did not know it.

Nor did they know where the marvellous stuff came from. The Phoenician
sailors had brought it from the coast of Gaul. The Gauls said that they
had got it from the Tribes who dwelt near a northern water. They did not
suspect, those Ancient Greeks, wise as they were, that the
stuff--amber--was a petrified gum from the pine forests buried for
unknown ages under the waves of the Baltic and in the amber-beds of its
coast.

And if you admire amber, "the balsam of the forest, the gold of the sun,
the shining of the water, the tin gling freshness of the breeze, when
the world was young," you may read more about it in the Tiny Dictionary.

### The Baltic Nations Today

TODAY, great Christian nations descended from heathen Vikings and the
Baltic Tribes of old times rule the Baltic Sea. A number of them have no
sea-outlet for their ships to pass to other lands, except through the
Baltic. That Sea is a great centre of world-trade.

The Baltic measures about 160,000 square miles. Its waters are nearly
tideless, almost saltless, and in places quite shallow, and are warmed
by the Gulf Stream. In the northeast lie thousands of islands and
islets.

The Baltic stretches one long finger northward between Sweden and
Finland, and becomes the Gulf of Bothnia. It points another finger
westward towards Russia, between Finland and Estonia, and becomes the
Gulf of Finland. It presses a finger into Latvia's coast, and is the
Gulf of Riga.

As for the nations and races of the Baltic shores, get out your map and
count them. They are many--German, Polish, Danish, Swedish, also
Russian, and all those interesting peoples living on the eastern coast.

And it is those interesting East Baltic folk, Finnish, Estonian,
Latvian, and Lithuanian, who have told the stories in this book. So if
you want to know about the Lapps who belong to the Republic of Finland,
and about the Northern Lights, Lapp Reindeer Kings, Finland's thousand
lakes and isles, Estonia's wonders, Latvia and Lithuania of the Amber
Coast, and of many strange Baltic Things, read the Tiny Dictionary. Read
it through! It is like a story--a true one!
