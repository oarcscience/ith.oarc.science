### THE RAINBOW MAIDEN

CLING! CLING! CLING! CLANG! CLING! Listen to the Red-Haired Wizard from
Suomi the beautiful of the thousand lakes and thousand isles!

Listen to his tale of Vainamoinen, Ancient Wizard:

It was in those first Golden Wonder Days that the rash boastful
Youkahainen promised his lovely, young sister Aino to be the bride of
the Ancient Vainamoinen.

But Aino, weeping bitter tears, clad herself in the finest of blue
robes, adorned her head with gold and silver, girded herself with a
golden girdle, and tied bands of blue and scarlet about her forehead.

Then she wandered hither and yon; for three days she wandered, singing
sadly, singing madly, till on the third day she reached the purple
border of a blue lake. There she hung her silken robes on an alder, and
her scarlet and blue ribbands on an aspen. Down she sat on a large,
many-colored rock in the water, and wailed and lamented.

Then suddenly the rock sank to the bottom of the lake, and the lovely
Maiden Aino became a Water-Maiden in the grottoes of the Lake King.
Sometimes in the form of a water-salmon she swam to and fro in the
waves.

Now it happened that Vainamoinen heard of the wonder-salmon, and set out
to catch it. Day after day, in his copper boat, he glided over the
waves, but he fished in vain with his copper rod and golden line. Though
he caught the salmon once, it slipped through his fingers into the
water.

Then Aino in her fish-shape raised her head above the waves, and cried
mockingly:

"O Vainamoinen, pitiful old thing! You have not the wit to hold me! I am
the darling of the Water King, the youngest Daughter of the Surge!"

Then turning away, she dived deep, deep into the lake, and was never
seen again.

The ancient Vainamoinen, with bowed head and sorrowful sighs, guided his
copper boat to land.

The days passed, and he was lonely and grief-stricken. Then thought he:

"I will go to dismal, distant Lapland, and there seek the Rainbow Maiden
for my bride. She, the most beautiful of all Maidens, dwells upon a
Magic Rainbow."

So to the land of cruel winter, the land of little sunshine,
Vainamoinen, mounted on his Magic Dappled Steed, plunged onward, onward
towards the cold Northern land. Still onward the Magic Dappled Steed
galloped, till it reached the blue sea water. Then over the water it
sped.

Now it happened that the boastful Youkahainen, Lapland's most wicked
Wizard, saw Vainamoinen skimming over the blue waves. He raised his
Magic Crossbow, drew its cruel bow-string, and loosed a feathered arrow.
Fast sped the arrow, stuck the Magic Dappled Steed, and passed through
Vainamoinen's shoulder. Headlong into the sea, plunged Vainamoinen.

Then the boastful evil Youkahainen thought that Vainamoinen was dead, so
he hurried home boasting more loudly.

But the rolling billows upheld the ancient Wizard. He swam through the
deep sea, and floated on the tide like a branch of aspen. He swam six
days in summer, and six nights in golden moonlight. Then there rose a
mighty Wind Storm, and an eagle came soaring around his head. On its
back, the eagle carried him to the coast of dismal Lapland, set him
down, and flew away.

Then Vainamoinen, old and lonely, sat down beside the border of the blue
sea, and fell to bitter weeping. Three long days he wept and lamented.

Now it chanced that the Rainbow Maiden, rosy and beautiful, went out
early one morning to gather six white fleeces from six gentle lambkins,
to make her a robe of the softest raiment. She heard a wailing from the
water, a weeping from the seashore, a hero's voice lamenting. Straight
she ran to her mother, old Louhi the Lapland Witch.

Old Louhi, toothless creature, hurried down to the water-side. There she
found Vainamoinen weeping in a grove of alders and shivering aspens. His
locks were flowing wildly and his lips were trembling. She led him to
her dwelling, fed him, let him warm himself at her fire, and then said:

"Weep no more, O Vainamoinen, Wizard Great of the Land of Heroes! Grieve
no more, friend of the waters! Live here with us, and be always welcome.
You shall eat salmon from our platters, feed on the sweetest of bacon
and the most delicate of small fish."

But Vainamoinen answered shaking his head strangely:

"O Lapland Witch, I am grateful! Though toothsome and delicate is your
food, yet food in my own home is more to me. It is better to dwell in my
own beloved home in the Land of Heroes, there to drink cool, clear water
in birchen cups, than in strange lands to quaff the richest liquor from
golden bowls."

"What will you give me, O ancient Vainamoinen," said the Witch, "if I
carry you back to your own fireside in the Land of Heroes?"

"If you will take me back to hear once more the silver-voiced cuckoos
call, I will give you a helmet full of gold, or fill your cups with
sparkling silver."

"Surely you are a wise and true Wizard, O Vainamoinen!" answered the old
Witch craftily. "But I do not want your gold or silver. Can you forge
for me the Sampo, with its many colored lid and its many many pictures,
make it from the tips of the white swan's wing-plumes, from the magic
milk of virtue, from a single grain of barley, from the finest wool of
lambkins? If you can, I will give you my lovely daughter, the Rainbow
Maiden, to go with you to the Land of Heroes, to hear the silver-voiced
cuckoos sing."

"I cannot forge the Sampo with its lid of many colors," answered
Vainamoinen. "But if you will take me back to my own home, I will send
you the Wizard Blacksmith, Ilmarinen. He is a man of mighty muscle. None
but he can wield the Heavy Hammer. He will forge the Sampo and beat its
lid of many colors. He alone can win the lovely Rainbow Maiden!"

"I will give my darling daughter to him who can forge the Sampo," said
the old Witch. "Go, send Ilmarinen here."

Then she harnessed a Magic Horse to her snow-white sledge of birch-wood,
placed the ancient Vainamoinen on the sledge, and sent him homeward to
the Land of Heroes.

And as he raced onward, onward, onward, rushing along the roadway, he
heard the whizzing of a loom and the mocking of a voice. Lifting his
eyes he saw a rainbow. On it was seated the Rainbow Maiden, lovelier
than a dream, and dressed in a gold and silver air-gown. Merrily flew a
golden shuttle to and fro in the Maiden's hands. She was weaving a web
of finest, richest texture, with a weaving comb of silver. And she
mocked the Great Wizard, as she rustled the silver webs of wondrous
beauty, mocked him as he rode along, mocked him with many words of song
and laughter.

"LISTEN now, O ye Lapp People!" cried the Red-Haired Wizard of Finland
finishing this story. "Later I shall tell you another tale:

Tell you all of Ilmarinen,  
Mighty Blacksmith, mighty forger,  
Who could wield the Magic Hammer,  
Weld the wondrous Magic Sampo,  
Woo the mocking Rainbow Maiden.  
Ilmarinen, strongest Wizard!
