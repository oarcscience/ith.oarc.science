FROM  
ESTONIA  
THE WISE AND THE FREE  
LAND OF ENCHANTMENT  
AND OF  
WONDER LEGENDS

Where the mystic cliffs are rising,  
Where the billows beat and clammer,  
Where they leap, and boil, and bubble,  
In a Cavern, Crystal-Lighted,  
Sings Estonia's Happy Wizard--  
Sings a song of weird enchantments,  
Sings of gnomes and magic serpents,  
Sings of treasure and of mermaids,  
Sings of fairies and of witches,  
Sings of moons, and suns, and starlets,  
Sings the mighty deeds of wonder  
Wrought by strong and handsome Heroes,  
In Estonia, Land of Magic,  
In Estonia, Land of Wizards.
