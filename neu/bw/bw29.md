### THE GOLD AXE

GLITTER! SHINE! SHINE! GLITTER! Listen to the Wizard with yellow
eyeballs and green hair!

Once on a time, in a farmhouse, a young Maiden sat spinning by the light
of a burning pine-splinter. The farmer's wife and her daughter--the
farmer had been dead for three years--were asleep already, for they were
very lazy and liked to play the grand lady.

They always put off all the household tasks on the Maiden, who from
sun-up to midnight had to keep her hands busy, without ever satisfying
those who provided her with bread. If she did anything well and
carefully, it was always, "What of it? Bestir yourself and finish the
rest." And at the very least fault, it was scoldings and blows.

What was there to do? Ilsa, for that was the Maiden's name, had no
parents and was poor. So she had to endure both the bad and the good.
And there was a special reason why this was hard--the neighbor's son, a
brave, handsome lad, would have her for his wife if his parents were not
against it. It was not fitting, they thought, that the heir to a farm
should woo a poor girl. He should bring home a farmer's daughter. And
she was already chosen--no other than the daughter of the Maiden's
Mistress. The wedding was to take place at Easter.

Ilsa loved the good Hans with all her heart, but she had to shut away
her feelings in her breast, from the eyes and ears of the world. She
was, yes! a poor orphan. Who cared to ask after her weal or woe? So Ilsa
sat brooding at the spinning-wheel, while the icy North Wind howled and
raged around the house, and whirled the flocks of snowflakes against its
walls.

Many bitter tears fell on the flax, many heavy sighs ascended to the low
smoke-blackened rafters. Till from the sighs and tears there was formed
a sad complaining little song:

See! The sun is hurrying on.  
Let me to the shadows flee!  
Little Mother can no more  
In the sunshine lead poor me.

Wait! O wait, thou hurrying sun!  
To my words, O listen! hear!  
Take a thousand greetings sweet,  
To my little Mother dear.

Low sets the sun--so very low!  
Little Mother's far away.  
I cannot overtake the sun,  
Nor words to little Mother say!

The hoarse voice of the Mistress growled from her room, "To the Evil One
with your sing-song!"

The daughter then began to scold, "If you will complain, go outside and
howl with the North Wind."

Ilsa was silent and tried to spin on, but eyes and hands refused their
service. Tired, she leaned her blond golden head against the hard wall,
and closed her eyes. The pine-splinter had burned down and gone out, and
it was dark in the room. Outside the North Wind howled and raged.

It was about six o'clock in the morning when the Maiden was startled out
of her sleep, by a knocking on the little window. She stepped outside,
but in the darkness of the winter morning could see no one. A trembling
voice like an old beggar's fell on her ear:

"Pity me, dear Maiden, a lost, hungry, nigh-frozen, old man!"

Ilsa thought for a moment. She knew well that her Mistress never gave
anything to a beggar, but chased any beggar from the house with insults
and jeering. But she and her daughter were sleeping now, and would
certainly not get up till seven o'clock.

"Come with me to the cow stable, Old Man," Ilsa said compassionately.
"There you may warm yourself, and I will give you some bread and milk."

She let the benumbed old man into the stable, let him sit down on an
overturned bucket, and milked some milk into a bowl. Then she fetched
from the house a bit of bread, which the night before, in her great
sorrow, she had not been able to choke down.

The beggar refreshed himself, and warmed himself as best he was able.
Then he said to Ilsa, but not in a trembling voice, no! but with musical
accents:

"Receive my thanks for your pity and your charity. I am not he for whom
you take me. Who I am, however, it is not necessary for you to learn.
But this I may say, I know you and all that your heart thinks and feels.
I wish your happiness. Listen, now, to my words! Have you never heard of
Lauskis and his Gold Axe?"

Ilsa said, "No."

"Lauskis is a Spirit of the Cold, who, when the frost is strong, goes
about cracking the earth with his Gold Axe. If a young and innocent
Maiden at midnight, just between the first and twelfth stroke of the
hour, runs three times around the house, it comes about that Lauskis the
Frost Spirit loses his Axe. This Axe is fashioned out of rich heavy
gold, and whoever finds it will receive for it many thousands of gold
pieces. Only innocence, courage, and swiftness can win it."

So spoke the old man.

Ilsa gazed on him in wonderment. But where was he? The bucket on which
he had been sitting was empty! And the dull light of dawn showed no
trace of him. The young girl involuntarily said a short prayer, and went
back thoughtfully to the house. There was the mistress already up, and
the every-day misery began again. So the winter passed away.

The stormy January was followed by a bitter cold February. At night the
earth cracked and the ice burst on the pond. One day the Mistress and
her daughter went to the city to buy a few trinkets for the wedding.
They were not to return till the next afternoon. Ilsa was left all alone
in the house.

That evening while she was spinning, the half-forgotten tale of the
strange old man came back to her, and the longer she thought of his
words, the greater grew in her an irresistible desire to run a race with
the Lauskis.

The hours till midnight went by like a dream. Just as the old wall-clock
in the Mistress' room struck, the Maiden rushed out and hurried like the
wind three times around the house.

There came such a fearful crash! House, stable, and corncrib trembled
and began to rock to and fro. Ilsa could scarcely keep herself upright
by holding on to the doorposts.

But soon this was all over. The moon shone out sharp and clear, as it
does only in the Northland winter, and it shone on a magnificent Gold
Axe lying directly at Ilsa's feet.

At Easter-time the neighbors celebrated the wedding of Hans, not to the
daughter of the farmer's wife, but to the long despised Maiden, the poor
orphan, now the richest girl in the neighborhood.

As the years passed the pair lived happily and contented; and if they
are not dead they are living today.
