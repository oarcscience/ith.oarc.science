### THE HIDDEN MAIDEN

RING! RING! RING! RING! Listen to the Living Speaking Kantele!

In the land where the sea shines white in the twilight of midnight,
where the Kantele sighs and breathes the sweetest music, there stands an
ancient Castle. Its frowning massive walls rise from an island. Around
the walls flows a strong current of water, so deep that it looks inky
black. Icy cold is the water and swift of current. There never was a
swimmer who could swim through that current guarding the Castle.

Fiercely frowns the Castle, for it knows many a terrible secret. Its
thick walls are silent, and they are blind for they have no outside
windows.

Once, long ago, the brave Finns held the Castle against the attacking
Russian foe. They were defending a lovely Swedish Maiden from the enemy
who wished to seize her. At last, just as the Russians were taking the
Castle, the girl's brave defenders hid her away in a secret place. With
great difficulty the Russians scaled the walls. One by one, they killed
the Finns. At last there was no one left to tell where the Maiden was.

The Russian soldiers entered the great hall, grand and gloomy, where the
flare of torches fell upon the armor. But no Maiden was there. They
rushed up the stairway, they searched the round tower, they climbed deep
down into the hollow vaults, but the Maiden was not there. In vain they
searched in every corner, room, and dungeon, the lovely Swedish Maiden
was never found.

Time went by, high up on the wall an ash-tree, delicate and graceful,
grew up out of the stones. Then men knew where the Maiden was. Her
defenders, rather than let her fall into the hands of the foe, had
sealed her close in the wall, where her shrieks and moans could not
betray her. Then all had died defending her, and no one was left to tell
where she was hidden.

And there the ash-tree hangs to-day. So rings and sings the sweet sad
music of the Kantele!
