## CHAPTER VI.

### NOTICES OF DOUBTFUL VALUE; FICTIONS.

IT will be remembered that a passage in the Book of Settlement
\[Landnamabok\] recites the discovery, by one Ari Marsson, of a country
lying westward from Ireland, called White-men's-land, or Ireland the
Great. This White-men's-land is also mentioned in the Saga of Eric the
Red, and in both places is assigned a location in the vicinity of
Wineland the Good. Many writers have regarded this White-men's-land as
identical with a strange country, the discovery of which is recounted in
the Eyrbyggja Saga, having been led to this conclusion, apparently, from
the fact that both unknown lands lay to the "westward," and that there
is a certain remote resemblance between the brief particulars Of the
Eric's Saga and the more detailed narrative of Eyrbyggja.

It is related in the Eyrbyggja Saga that a certain Biorn Asbrandsson
became involved in an intrigue with a married woman named Thurid, which
resulted in his wounding the affronted husband and slaying two of the
husband's friends, for which he was banished from Iceland for the term
of three years. Biorn went abroad, led an adventurous life, and received
the name of "kappi" \[champion, hero\] on account of his valorous deeds.
He subsequently returned to Iceland, where he was afterwards known as
the Broadwickers'-champion. He brought with him on his return not only
increase of fame,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

but the added graces of bearing due to his long fellowship with foreign
chieftains, and he soon renewed his attentions to his former mistress.
The husband, fearing to cope alone with so powerful a rival, invoked the
aid of one skilled in the black art to raise a storm, which should
overwhelm the object of his enmity. The hero, however, after three days
of exposure to the preternaturally-agitated elements, returned
exhausted, but in safety, to his home. The husband then prevailed upon
his powerful brother-in-law, the godi ( [72](nda12.htm#xref_72).md) Snorri,
to come to his assistance, and as a result of Snorri's intervention,
Biorn agreed to leave the country. He accordingly rode "south, to a ship
in Laga-haven, in which he took passage that same summer, but they were
rather late in putting to sea. They sailed away with a north-east wind,
which prevailed far into the summer, but nothing was heard of this ship
for a long time afterwards."

Further on in the same saga we read of the fortuitous discovery of this
same Biorn by certain of his fellow-countrymen, and as the account of
their strange meeting contains the sole description of this unknown
land, it may best be given in the words of the saga. "It was in the
latter days of Olaf the Saint that Gudleif engaged in a trading voyage
westward to Dublin, and when he sailed from the west it was his
intention to proceed to Iceland. He sailed to the westward of Ireland,
and had easterly gales and winds from the northeast, and was driven far
to the westward over the sea and toward the southwest, so that they had
lost all track of land. The summer was then far spent, and they uttered
many prayers that they

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

might be permitted to escape from the sea, and it befell thereupon that
they became aware of land. It was a great country, but they did not know
what country it was. Gudleif and his companions determined to sail to
the land, for they were weary with battling with the tempestuous sea.
They found a good harbour there, and they had been alongside the land
but a short time when men came toward them. They did not recognize a
single man, but it rather seemed to them that they were speaking Irish;
soon so great a throng of men had drawn about them that they amounted to
several hundreds. These people thereupon seized them all and bound them,
and then drove them up upon the land. They were then taken to a meeting,
at which their case was considered. It was their understanding that some
\[of their captors\] wished them to be slain, while others would have
them distributed among the people and thrown into bondage. While this
was being argued they descried a body of men riding, and a banner was
carried in their midst, from which they concluded that some manner of
chieftain must be in the company; and when this band drew near they saw
a tall and warlike man riding beneath the banner; he was far advanced in
years, however, and his hair was white. All of the people assembled
bowed before this man and received him as he had been their lord; they
soon observed that all questions and matters for decision were submitted
to him. This man then summoned Gudleif and his fellows, and when they
came before him he addressed them in the Northern tongue \[i. e.,
Icelandic\], and asked them to what country they belonged. They

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

responded that they were, for the most part, Icelanders. This man asked
which of them were the Icelanders. Gudlief then advanced before this
man, and greeted him worthily, and he received his salutations
graciously, and asks from what part of Iceland they came, and Gudleif
replied that he came from Borgarfirth. He then enquired from what part
of Borgarfirth he came, and Gudleif informs him. After this he asked
particularly after every one of the leading men of Borgarfirth and
Breidafirth, and in the course of the conversation he asked after Snorri
Godi and Thurid, of Froda, his sister, and he enquired especially after
all details concerning Froda, and particularly regarding the boy
Kiartan, <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) who was then the master at
Froda. The people of the country, on the other hand, demanded that some
judgment should be reached concerning the ship's crew. After this the
tall man left them, and called about him twelve of his men, and they sat
together for a long time in consultation, after which they betook
themselves to the \[general\] meeting. Thereupon the tall man said to
Gudleif and his companions: 'We, the people of this country, have
somewhat considered your case, and the inhabitants have given your
affair into my care, and I will now give you permission to go whither ye
list; and even though it may seem to you that the summer is far spent,
still I would counsel you to leave here, for the people here are
untrustworthy and hard to deal with, and have already formed the belief
that their laws have been broken.' Gudleif replied: 'If it be vouchsafed
us to reach our native land, what shall we say

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

concerning him who has granted us our freedom.' He answered: 'That I may
not tell you, for I cannot bear that my relatives and foster-brothers
should have such a voyage hither as ye would have had if ye had not had
my aid; but now I am so advanced in years,' said he, 'that the hour may
come at any time when age shall rise above my head; and even though I
should live yet a little longer, still there are those here in the land
who are more powerful than I who would offer little mercy to strangers,
albeit these are not in this neighbourhood where ye have landed.'
Afterward this man aided them in equipping their ship, and remained with
them until there came a fair wind, which enabled them to put to sea. But
before he and Gudleif parted, this man took a gold ring from his hand
and handed it to Gudleif, and with it a goodly sword; and he then said
to Gudleif: 'If it be granted thee to come again to thy father-land,
then do thou give this sword to Kiartan, the master at Froda, and the
ring to his mother.' Gudleif said: 'What shall I reply as to who sends
these precious things?' He answered: 'Say that he sends them who was
more of a friend of the mistress at Froda than of the Godi at Helgafell,
her brother. But if any persons shall think they have discovered from
this to whom these treasures belonged, give them my message, that I
forbid any man to go in search of me, for it would be a most desperate
undertaking, unless he should fare as successfully as ye have in finding
a landing-place; for here is an extensive country with few harbours, and
over all a disposition to deal harshly with strangers, unless it befall
as it has in this case.' After

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

this they parted. Gudleif and his men put to sea, and arrived in Ireland
late in the autumn, and passed the winter in Dublin; but in the summer
they sailed to Iceland, and Gudleif delivered the treasures, and all men
held of a verity that this man was Biorn Broadwickers'-champion; but
people have no other proof of this, save these particulars, which have
now been related."

It will be observed that the narrator of the saga does not in this
incident once connect this unknown land with White-men's-land, nor does
he offer any suggestion as to its situation. The work of identifying
this strange country with White-men's-land, and so with Wineland the
Good, has been entirely wrought by the modern commentator. If we accept
as credible a meeting so remarkable as the one here described, if we
disregard the statements of the narrative showing the existence of
horses in this unknown land, which the theorist has not hesitated to do,
and, finally, if we assume that there was at this time an Irish colony
or one speaking a kindred tongue in North America, we may conclude that
Biorn's adopted home was somewhere on the eastern North-American coast.
If, however, we read the statements of the saga as we find them, they
seem all to tend to deny this postulate, rather than to confirm it. The
entire story has a decidedly fabulous appearance, and, as has been
suggested by a learned editor of the saga, a romantic cast, which is not
consonant with the character of the history in which it appears. A
narrative, the truth of which the narrator himself tells us had not been
ratified by collateral evidence, and whose details are so vague and
indefinite, seems to afford

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

historical evidence of a character so equivocal that it may well be
dismissed without further consideration.

Of an altogether different nature from the narrative of discovery above
recited is the brief notice of the finding of a new land, set down in
the Icelandic Annals toward the end of the thirteenth century. In the
Annales regii, in the year 1285, the record reads: "Adalbrand and
Thorvald, Helgi's sons, found New-land;" in the Annals of the Flatey
Book, under the same year, "Land was found to the westward off Iceland;"
and again in Gottskalk's Annals an entry exactly similar to that of the
Flatey Book. In Hoyer's Annals the entry is of a different character:
"Helgi's sons sailed into Greenland's uninhabited regions."

In the parchment manuscript AM. 415, 4to, written, probably, about the
beginning of the fourteenth century, is a collection of annals called
"Annales vetustissimi," and here, under the year 1285, is an entry
similar to that of the Flatey Book: "Land found to the westward off
Iceland." In the Skalholt Annals, on the other hand, the only
corresponding entry against the year 1285 is: "Down-islands discovered."

It required but the similarity between the names Newland and
Newfoundland to arouse the effort to identify the two countries; and the
theory thus created was supposed to find confirmation in a passage in a
copy of a certain document known as Bishop Gizur Einarsson's Register
\[brefa-bok\], for the years 1540-47, which is contained in a paper
manuscript of the seventeenth century, AM. 266, fol. This passage is as
follows: "Wise men

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

have said that you must sail to the southwest from Krisuvik mountain to
Newland." Krisuvik mountain is situated on the
[promontory](errata.htm#2.md) of Reykianess, the southwestern extremity of
Iceland, and, as has been recently pointed out, to sail the course
suggested by Bishop Gizur would in all probability land the adventurous
mariner in southeastern Greenland. The record of the Annals, however, is
so explicit, that in determining the site of "Newland" we do not need to
orient ourselves by extraneous evidence. We are informed, that, in 1285,
Helgi's sons sailed into Greenland's "obygdir," the name by which the
Greenland colonists were wont to designate the uninhabited east coast of
Greenland; and as it is elsewhere distinctly stated that the "Newland,"
which these men discovered in the same year, lay to the "westward off
Iceland," there can be little room for hesitancy in reaching, the
conclusion that "Newland," and the "Down-islands" all lie together, and
are probably only different names for, the same discovery. However this
may be, it is at least manifest, from the record, that if Newland was
not a part of the eastern coast of Greenland, there is nothing to
indicate that it was anywhere in the region of Newfoundland.

A few years after this discovery is recorded, namely in 1289, we find
the following statement in the Flatey Annals: "King Eric sends Rolf to
Iceland to seek Newland;" and again in the next year: "Rolf travelled
about Iceland soliciting men for a Newland voyage." No additional
information has been preserved touching this enterprise, and it
therefore seems probable that if the voyage

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

was actually undertaken, it was barren of results. The Flatey Annals
note the death of Rolf, Land-Rolf, as he was called, in 1295, and as no
subsequent seeker of Newland is named in Icelandic history, it may be
assumed that the spirit of exploration died with him.

This brief record of the Annals is unquestionably historically accurate;
moreover there may be somewhat of an historical foundation for the
adventures of the Broadwickers'-champion recounted in the Eyrbyggja
Saga; neither of these notices of discovery, however, appears to have
any connection with the discovery of Wineland; they have been considered
here chiefly because of the fact that they have been treated in the past
as if they had a direct bearing upon the Wineland history.

The historical and quasi-historical material relating to the discovery
of Wineland has now been presented. A few brief notices of Helluland,
contained in the later Icelandic literature, remain for consideration.
These notices necessarily partake of the character of the sagas in which
they appear, and as these sagas are in a greater or less degree pure
fictions, the references cannot be regarded as possessing much
historical value.

First among these unhistorical sagas is the old mythical tale of
Arrow-Odd, of which two recensions exist; the more recent and inferior
version is that which contains the passages where Helluland is
mentioned, as follows: "'But I will tell thee where Ogmund is; he is
come into that firth which is called Skuggi, it is in Helluland's
deserts . . . .; he has gone thither because he does not wish to meet
thee; now thou mayest track him home, if

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

thou wishest, and see how it fares.' Odd said thus it should be.
Thereupon they sail until they come into Greenland's sea, when they turn
south and west around the land . . . They sail now until they come to
Helluland, and lay their course into the Skuggi-firth. And when they had
reached the land the father and son went ashore, and walked until they
saw where there was a fortification, and it seemed to them to be very
strongly built."

In the same category with Arrow-Odd's Saga may be placed two other
mythical sagas, the Saga of Halfdan Eysteinsson, and the Saga of Halfdan
Brana's-fostering; in the first of these the passage containing the
mention of Helluland is as follows: "Raknar brought Helluland's deserts
under his sway, and destroyed all the giants there." In the second of
these last-mentioned sagas the hero is driven out of his course at sea,
until he finally succeeds in beaching his ship upon "smooth sands"
beside "high cliffs;" "there was much drift-wood on the sands and they
set about building a hut, which was soon finished. Halfdan frequently
ascended the glaciers, and some of the men bore him company . . . . The
men asked Halfdan what country this could be. Halfdan replied that they
must be come to Helluland's deserts."

Belonging to a class of fictitious sagas known as "landvættasogur"
\[stories of a country's guardian spirits\], is the folk-tale of Bard
the Snow-fell god. The first chapter of this tale begins: "There was a
king named Dumb, who ruled over those gulfs, which extend northward
around Helluland and are now called Dumb's sea." Subsequently we find
brief mention of a king of Helluland, of

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

whom Gest, the son of the hero of the saga, says: "I have never seen him
before, but I have been told by my relatives that the king was called
Rakin, and from their account I believe I recognize him; he at one time
ruled over Helluland and many other countries, and after he had long
ruled these lands he caused himself to be buried alive, together with
five hundred men, at Raknslodi; he murdered his father and mother, and
many other people; it seems to me probable, from the reports of other
people, that his burial-mound is northward in Helluland's deserts." Gest
goes in quest of this mound, sails to Greenland's deserts, where, having
traversed the lava-fields \[!\] for three days on foot, he at length
discovers the burial-mound upon an island near the sea-coast; "some men
say that this mound was situated to the northward off Helluland, but
wherever it was, there were no settlements in the neighbourhood."

The brief extracts here quoted will suffice to indicate not only the
fabulous character of the sagas in which they appear, but they serve
further to show how completely the discoveries of Leif, and the
exploration of Karlsefni had become distorted in the popular memory of
the Icelanders at the time these tales were composed, which was probably
in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. The Helluland of these stories
is an unknown region, relegated, in the popular superstition, to the
trackless wastes of northern Greenland.
