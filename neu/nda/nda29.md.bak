## CHAPTER IV.

### DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY THE IRISH.

IN the preceding chapter I intimated that the Irish have some claim to
the honor of having discovered America before Columbus. It is a large
subject, and all I am able to, do at this time is to give the particular
facts and traditions, and some hints in regard to their proper
interpretation. The name of St. Brendan (or Brandan, as it is sometimes
written) is well known, at least it may be found in the larger
cyclopedias. He was an Irish monk, famous for his voyages upon the sea
to strange lands. The traditions handed down to us from the Middle Ages
contain many legends in regard to him. He belongs to the sixth century
after Christ, and hence to an age where fact and fiction are strangely
mingled. His death is said to have occurred A. D. 577. Report has it
that he went on a nine years' voyage, and visited unknown lands. These
lands are described in the work "De Fortunatis Insulis," published in
the eleventh century, in the Latin language, and translated into French
about the year 1120. Versions of his voyages appeared also in German,
English and Dutch. Popular tradition has identified the Fortunate
Islands of St. Brendan with America, and given this Irish saint the
credit of discovering the western continent.

According to one legend, St. Brendan, conducted by

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

an angel, descended to the lower world, where he witnessed the torments
of the Devil and of the damned, and subsequently he came to, the
Fortunate Islands, and finally he visited Paradise. At the end of the
nine years he returned to Ireland, and gave an account of his
adventures. The less superstitious interpreted St. Brendan's voyages as
referring to existing countries, and I now hasten to declare it here as
a fact that the reports concerning St. Brendan constituted one of the
causes which led the Spanish and Portuguese to undertake voyages of
discovery in the western ocean. Thus St. Brendan is one of the links in
that chain of influences operating on the mind of the great Genoese
navigator.

There is evolution in history, as well as in other things. The voyages
of the Phœnicians and of the Greek Pytheas were germs that budded in the
explorations of the Irish and of the Welsh, blossomed in the expeditions
of the Norsemen, and culminated and bore fruit in the discovery of
America by Columbus. The Phœnicians and Columbus are the two ends of the
long chain of events in the opening of the new world to civilization.
Columbus was a scholar, who studied industriously all books and
manuscripts that contained any information about voyages and
discoveries. His searching mind sought out the writings of Adam of
Bremen and the works relating to St. Brendan. It is in this wise that we
are able to explain the firm conviction that Columbus invariably
expressed in his reference to land in the west. In that way we are able
to account for the absolute certainty and singular firmness with which
he talked of land across the

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

ocean, and thus, too, we can account for his accurate knowledge of the
breadth of the ocean.

It is now my privilege to call the attention of my readers once more to
the Icelandic sagas, and show from them corroborations of the above
theory concerning the discovery of America by the Irish. There was a
powerful [chieftain](errata.htm#15.md) in Iceland, by name Are Marson, and
the sagas tell us that in the year 983, that is, three years before
Vinland was seen by Bjarne Herjulfson, he was driven to Great Ireland by
storms, and was there baptized. The first author of this account was his
contemporary, Rafn, surnamed the Limerick Trader, he having long resided
in Limerick, Ireland. The illustrious Icelandic sagaman, Are the Wise,
descendant in the fourth degree from Are Marson, states on this subject
that his uncle, Thorkel Gellerson (whose testimony he on another
occasion declares to be worthy of all credit), had been informed by
Icelanders, who had their information from Thorfin Sigurdson, Earl of
Orkney, that Are Marson had been recognized in Great Ireland, and could
not get away from there, but was held there in great respect. This
statement, therefore, shows that in those times (about the year 983)
there was an occasional intercourse between the western part of Europe,
that is to, say, the Orkneys and Ireland, and the Great Ireland or
Whitemen's Land of America. The sagas from which we get our information
about Leif Erikson expressly state that Great Ireland lies to the west
in the sea, near Vinland the Good, six days' sail west from Ireland.
Doubtless; the "VI" has arisen through some mistake or carelessness

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

of the transcriber of the original manuscript, which is now lost, and
was erroneously written for XX, or XI, or perhaps XVI, which would
correspond with the distance. Such a mistake might easily have been
caused by a blot or defect in the manuscript.

It must have been in this same Great Ireland that Bjorn Asbrandson,
surnamed the Champion of Breidavik, spent the latter part of his life.
He had been adopted into the celebrated band of Jormsborg warriors,
under Palnatoke. His relations with Thurid of Froda, in Iceland, a
sister of the powerful official Snorre, drew upon him the enmity and
persecution of the latter, in consequence of which he found himself
obliged to quit Iceland forever, and in 999 he set sail with a northeast
wind.

And now comes the most interesting part of this story. Gudleif
Gudlaugson, the ancestor of the celebrated historian, Snorre Sturlason,
had made a trading voyage to Dublin, in Ireland, but when he left that
place again, with the intention of sailing around Ireland and returning
to Iceland, he met with long-continued northeasterly winds, which drove
him far to the southwest in the ocean, and late in the summer he and his
company came at last to an extensive country, but they knew not what
land it was. They went on shore, whereupon a crowd of the natives,
several hundred in number, came against them and laid hands on them and
bound them. They did not know to what race these people belonged, but it
seemed to. them that their language resembled Irish. The natives now
took counsel whether they should kill

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

the strangers or make slaves of them. While they were deliberating, a
large company approached, displaying a banner, close to which rode a man
of distinguished appearance, who was far advanced in years and had gray
hair. The matter under deliberation was referred to his decision, when
to their astonishment it was discovered that he was none other than the
above named Bjorn Asbrandson. He caused Gudleif to be brought before
him, and addressing him in Icelandic, asked him whence he came. On
Gudleif's reply that he was an Icelander, Bjorn made many inquiries
about his acquaintances in Iceland, and particularly about his beloved
Thurid of Froda and her son, Kjartan, supposed to be his own son, and
who at that time was the proprietor of the estate of Froda. In the
meantime, the natives becoming impatient and demanding a decision, Bjorn
selected twelve of his company as counselors, and took them aside with
him, and some time afterward he went toward Gudleif and his companions,
and told them that the natives had left the matter to his decision. He
thereupon gave them their liberty, and advised them, although the summer
was then far advanced, to depart immediately, because the natives were
not to be depended upon and were difficult to deal with, and, moreover,
conceived that an infringement on their laws had been committed to their
disadvantage. He gave them a gold ring for Thurid and a sword for
Kjartan, and told them to charge his friends and relations not to come
over to him, as he had now become old and might daily expect that old
age would get the better of him; that the country was large, having

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

but few harbors, and that strangers must everywhere expect a hostile
reception. Gudleif and his company accordingly set sail again, and found
their way back to Dublin, where they spent the winter; but the next
summer they repaired to Iceland and delivered the presents, and
everybody was convinced that it was really Bjorn Asbrandson, the
Champion of Breidavik, that they had met with in this far-off country.

The date of Gudleif's voyage is the year 1029, and my readers may easily
find the account in chapter 64 of the Eyrbyggja Saga. The portion of
America here referred to is supposed to be situated south of the
Chesapeake Bay, and includes North and South Carolina, Georgia and East
Florida. In the saga of Thorfin Karlsefni, chapter 13, it is distinctly
called "Irland-it-Milka;" that is, Great Ireland. The presumption is
that the name Great Ireland arose from the fact that the inhabitants
seemed to Gudlaugson's party to speak Irish; that the country presumably
had been colonized by the Irish long before Gudlaugson's visit, and that
they, coming from their own green island to a vast continent possessing
many of the fertile qualities of their own native soil, found such an
appellation natural and appropriate. I see nothing improbable in this
conclusion; for the Irish, who visited and inhabited Iceland toward the
close of the eighth century, to accomplish which they had to traverse a
stormy ocean to the extent of eight hundred miles; who as early as 725
were found upon the Fareys (voyages between Ireland and Iceland in the
tenth century were of ordinary occurrence)--a people so familiar

with the sea were certainly capable of making a voyage across the
Atlantic Ocean.

The geography of the western world, according to the old Norsemen,
consisted of (1) Helluland (Newfoundland), (2) Markland (Nova Scotia),
(3) Vinland ([Massachusetts](errata.htm#16.md) or some part of New
England), and then (4) stretching far to the south of Vinland lay
Whitemen's Land or Great Ireland.
