LEIF ERIKSON DISCOVERS A NEW WORLD(From a drawing by Heller.)  
</span>

<span class="small">THE discovery of America by Norsemen about the year
1000, is so well authenticated as to be no longer a matter of mere
tradition, but to whom the honor is due is less easy to prove by the
historical sagas. The claim set up in favor of Bjarne Herjulfson is well
substantiated, but if the discovery be credited to Bjarne, to Leif
Erikson belongs the fame of having founded the first settlement in the
New World. This flourished for a time and was frequently visited by
other voyagers, until all the settlers it is supposed perished from a
plague known as the Black Death.</span>
