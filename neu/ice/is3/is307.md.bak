FROM PETER CLAUSON UNDAL'S TRANSLATION OF THE LOST "INGA SAGA";  ALSO
CALLED THE CROZIERMENS' SAGA.

 

      There arose a great noise both among the Birchshanks and the
Croziermen, for that there were many famous men who had lost all their
goods and money in that feud.  Then that plan was devised that the
summer after they should set off west into the Southern isles a sea
roving, and get them goods and money again.  And they fitted out ships
on both sides.  Peter Steypir and Reider the messenger who had to wife
Margaret daughter of king Magnus, Erling's son, became brothers in arms
that they might sail out to Jerusalem the next coming summer, and with
that they parted. (12) 

      Sometime after this atonement many asked leave on both sides; 
some went home to their houses and farms, and some on trading voyages,
and the next spring after then both Birchshanks and Croziermen sailed
with twelve ships a sea roving in the Western lands and harried on the
Southern isles, and the neighbouring isles, for the kings in those isles
had domestic feud with one another.  They plundered the Holy Island
(Iona) which the Northmen have always held sacred.  After that they fell
out among one another and parted, and so were beaten in various places. 
And they who came back to Norway were sharply spoken to by the bishops
for their plunderings.

      That summer Peter Steypir and Reider the messenger left the land
with two big ships and much folk, and their wives Ingibjorg and Margaret
king Magnus' daughter followed with them.  Of their journey much is
told.  Peter Steypir and his wife died on the journey, but Reider got to
Jerusalem and went back again to the Emperor in Constantinople, and
served him long and died there.

      In king Sverrir's time, Torald (!) the son of earl Maddad in
Orkney with many more there in the isles had risen up against him, and
called themselves the Island lads.  And when the earl became reconciled
again to king Sverrir, then all the land tax and fines in suits from
Orkney and Shetland were to fall to the king in Norway;  and the king
set his bailiff by name Arni Löria with the earl in Orkney, and earl
Harold durst not say a word against him so long as king Sverrir lived; 
but straightway after his death he caused Arni Löria to be treacherously
slain, and laid Orkney and Shetland under him again, with all scatts and
dues just as he had them before;  and he died two years after king Ingi
was made king in Norway.  After that his sons John and David became
earls in Orkney, and they held the lands like their father so long as
there was domestic feud in Norway;  but when they heard that the kings
were reconciled they sent bishop Björn to Norway.  He found king Ingi
and earl Hacon in Bergen, and made known to them the earls' errand that
they desired to be reconciled to them;  and it got so far that he took
leave on their behalf from the king and the earl, that the earls should
come to them the summer after and be reconciled to them.

      That summer when the vikings, that is Norse sea rovers, fared west
over the sea, and after the kings' atonement, then the king's officers
fared with him (the bishop) to Orkney and Shetland;  and the next summer
after the earls and the bishop came with them to Norway to be reconciled
with the king and the earl;  and they left the whole business to the
good pleasure of the king and earl.  They doomed them to pay a large sum
of money, and besides they had to give them pledges and hostages, and
swear to them faithfulness and obedience;  but at last king Ingi made
them his earls over Orkney and Shetland with such conditions as were
afterwards kept until their deathday.

      King Rognvald of Man in the Southern isles and Godred king of Man
had not for a long time paid the kings of Norway taxes.  Now when the
Norse vikings had swarmed about among the isles and plundered and burnt,
and the kings learnt that peace was made in Norway, then they were
afraid and set off to Norway, and were reconciled with king Ingi and
earl Hacon, and paid the taxes which were owing, and swore faith and
obedience to them, and took their lands as fiefs of the king of Norway,
and so sailed home again.

      There was a man called Erling in Fœroe, he gave himself out as
king Sverrir's son;  his mother was Astrid the daughter of Roi.  He set
out with some followers for the isles and wrought great wrong and
strife.  He had seven children, and afterwards he sailed to Norway on
board Einar the steward's ship, and betook himself to Philip and the
Lady Christine.  She received him well and owned him for her brother; 
and some years afterwards he died of bleeding after he had let himself
be bled.

1.                  See Dr. Smith in the 8th vol. of the Proceedings of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

2.                  Calfdale \] Calder, in Caithness.

3.                  The Danish Translation reads, "while he was a
dying."

4.                  Fl., quoting some collection of annals, reads thus,
"The death-day of earl Rognvald---Kali is five nights after Mary's mass
the former , in summer."

5.                  Fl. reads, "until God revealed his worthiness by
many and great miracles."

6.                  Afreka \] She was sister of Duncan, earl of Fife. 
When earl Harold quarrelled with the Scottish Court, during earl
Rognvald's absence in the Holy Land, he repudiated her, and married
Hvarflada, daughter of Malcolm McHeth, earl of Moray.  See below, ch.
119 comp. also Munch, N. H. iii. 847 note.

7.                  G. V. thinks that this passage from "So it was said"
to "with God," is a later interpolation.

8.                  Here the Danish Translation ends, adding "Finis.  A
final historical conclusion to this chronicle."  The following sentences
are from the Fl.

9.                  Hvarflada \] Comp. ch. 115 above, and note.

10.             Harold the young\]  This account of the latter years of
earl Harold Maddad son's reign and of the doings of earl Harold the
young is very confused, and the Saga disposes of the events of several
years in a very summary way.  Fuller accounts are to be found in the
Melrose Chronicle, in Fordun, and in Hoveden, Savile, Watts, p. 767. 
These accounts very in some material points, but Munch, N. H. iv. 41,
note, and 443, note, has done his best to reconcile them.

11.              The slaying of earl Harold the younger is assigned in
the Ann Island, to the year 1198;  cfr. Biskupass. i. 455 (fall Haralds
jarls únga á Katanesi).

12.              The Icelandic text to this first paragraph is preserved
in the abridged Ingi's Saga in Eirspennil (Unger's Ed., p. 235).  The
following is a translation of the passage: ---  "Then arose a noise in
either band from those men who had lost their money and yet had titles
to rank.  Then that counsel was taken that afterwards in the spring they
should harry in the Southern isles and get them money.  Then men were
chosen for this out of each band.  Then too they, Peter Steypir and
Reider the messenger, also took counsel;  he, Reidar, had to wife
Margaret, a daughter of king Magnus.  They proposed to fare out to
Jerusalem.  Then they parted, having made this agreement."  And in
another passage it is said:  --- "That summer they fared on a Viking
voyage into the Southern isles, Thormod thasram and Thormod foal-leg,
and Ospak the southislander.  These were of the Birchshanks.  But of the
Croziermen was Eric Tofi's son and Erlend pike, Berg muncher, and
Nicholas gilly.  They had twelve ships.  One winter later they fared
away out of the land, Peter Steypir (the stouper, cup bearer?) and
Reider, and had two ships.  And neither of them came back."  See Munch.
N. H. III. 539-544.
