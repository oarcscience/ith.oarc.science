THE BURNING OF BISHOP ADAM.

 

FROM THE FLATEY BOOK.

 

      When bishop John died in Caithness, he whom earl Harold caused to
be maimed, a man called Adam was chosen bishop in his stead;  and no one
knew his stock, for the child had been found at some church door.  The
Caithnesingers thought him rather hard in the bishoprick;  and they laid
most of the blame of that on a monk who was with him.  It was an old
custom that the bishop should have a span of butter for every thirty
kine;  this each householder was to pay who was in Caithness;  he more
who had more kine, but he less according to his means;  and each was to
pay according to the tale of his kine.  But bishop Adam wished to raise
the tax and have a span for every fifteen kine;  and when he got that he
claimed to have it for every twelve kine;  and when that was given up he
wished to have it for every ten kine.  But that all thought something
unheard of.  Then the Caithnesingers fared to find earl John, he was
then in Caithness, and raised this matter with him.  The earl said he
could give them no advice;  and beside that he thought it concerned him
very little;  he said two bad things were before them;  that it was
unbearable, but said he could not suggest another choice.  Bishop Adam
was then at the High church \[Halkirk\] in Thorsdale, but earl John was
a little way off.  The Caithnesingers then held a Thing on the fell
above the homestead in which the earl was.  Rafn the lawman was then
with the bishop, and he prayed the bishop rather to spare the men, also
he said he was afraid how things might go.  The bishop bade him be
quiet, and said the freemen would calm down of themselves.  Then a
message was sent to earl John with a prayer that he would reconcile the
bishop and the freemen;  but the earl would come never near the spot. 
Then the freemen ran down from the fell and fared hotly and eagerly. 
And when Rafn the lawman saw that he bade the bishop devise some plan to
save himself.  He and the bishop were drinking in a loft.  And when the
freemen came to the loft, the monk went out at the door;  and was
straightway smitten across the face, and fell down dead inside the
loft.  And when the bishop was told that he answered:  "That had not
happened sooner than was likely, for he was always making our matters
worse."  Then the bishop bade Rafn tell the freemen that he wished to be
reconciled with them.  But when this was told to the freemen, all those
among them who were wiser were glad to hear it.  Then the bishop went
out and meant to be reconciled.  But when the worse kind of men saw
that, those who were most mad, they seized bishop Adam, and brought him
into a little house, and set fire to it.  But the house burnt so quickly
that they who wished to save the bishop could do nothing.  Thus bishop
Adam died, and his body was little burnt when it was found.  Then a
fitting grave was bestowed on it and a worthy burial.  But those men who
had been the greatest friends of the bishop, they then sent men to find
the king of Scots.  Alexander was then king of Scots, the son of king
William the saint.  But when the king was ware of these tidings
............. so ill that men have those miseries in mind which he
wrought after the burning of the bishop in maiming of men and
manslaying, and loss of goods and banishment of men out of the land.

      And now we cannot tell more certainly of those tidings which
belong to the earls of the Orkneyingers than just as we have said.
