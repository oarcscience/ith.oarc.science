<p align="center">MAGNUS' SAGA THE LONGER.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Praise
glory and splendour and honour be to Almighty God, our redeemer and maker, for
his manifold mercy and grace, which he bestows on us who dwell on the uttermost
edge of the world;&nbsp; so that after the saying of the masters who so set it
in their books, it seems to them as though we were come out of the world.
&nbsp;And yet all the same though it be so, God hath deigned to show us his
mercy, especially in that he hath let us come to the knowledge of his blessed
name;&nbsp; and therewith given us strong pillars, the most saintly forerunners
of holy Christianity, from whose holiness the whole North shines and beams near
and far.&nbsp; These are, the saint king Olaf, and the exalted Hallvard his
kinsman, who adorn Norway with their halidoms;&nbsp; the worshipful Magnus, the
Isle-earl, who brightens the Orkneys with his holiness, to whose honour the aftercoming
Saga is put together.&nbsp; Herewith are the blessed bishops John and Thorlak,
who have enlightened Iceland with the exalted shining of their bright
worthiness.&nbsp; By this it may be seen that we are not far off from God's
mercy, though we be far off from other peoples in our abode in the world;&nbsp;
and therefore we are bound to pay Him thanks, honour and reverence all the time
of our life.</p>

<p>Master Robert, who hath collected and composed the Saga of the holy earl
Magnus in Latin, so begins his Prologue as may here be heard.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each
one bringeth such things as he hath means to bring into the tabernacle of God,
as a help to mercy for himself.&nbsp; One gold, others silver, some gemstones,
some goats hair and red buckskin;&nbsp; and such offerings are not to be
contemptuously esteemed, for of such is made the covering over the tabernacle
of God, to shield it and keep it from wet and sun heat.&nbsp; These words may
be so glossed with few words.&nbsp; Let every christain man offer to God of the
gifts and grants which He hath bestowed on him, what he hath best.&nbsp; That
God's christianity is the tabernacle that Moses made for God's service, denotes
its worth as a shelter and support against the onslaughts of his foes.&nbsp;
Gold denotes wit and wisdom;&nbsp; silver chastity;&nbsp; gemstones the
miracles of holy men;&nbsp; goatshair the repentance of sins;&nbsp; red
buckskin martyrdom.&nbsp; Now the man who reads may so make up his mind, that
all these offerings hath the holy Magnus offered to his Lord, as the story of
his life witnesseth.&nbsp; Now though the praise of God be not seemly in sinful
man's mouth, still it may be profitable and helpful to others;&nbsp; for we so
read that the whole house was filled with the sweetest savour of the ointment
and spices of that sinful woman, who in penitence fell down to wash and anoint
the Lord's feet.&nbsp; But after the bad fashion of those men who cultivate
others' lands, the neglect their own and let them lie dry, so we begin this
story about the life of earl Magnus the saint all the more trustfully and
lovingly, and we bestow our toil on such holy and sublime knowledge, because we
trust on and thoroughly look for his help to stay and strengthen us to his
worship and honour.&nbsp; Now for that he is a partaker in the kingdom of
heaven, and hath entered into the power of the Lord, so is he mighty to obtain
all that he willeth.&nbsp; But for that we are sinful, and for the sake of our
wretched life are not able to set others good examples of ourselves, so we show
saint Magnus with his fameful life, which all are bound to follow, and take
holy patterns from.&nbsp; Now that we may not make trouble to&nbsp; our readers
by this discourse, for the Lord made short discourses, so we make this story
plain with clear words and pure telling, as God hath granted us to discern.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
days of Harold Sigurd's son king of Norway there ruled as earls over the
Orkneys two brothers, Paul and Erlend, sons of earl Thorfinn, who has been the
mightiest of all the earls of the Orkneyingers.&nbsp; He was the son of earl
Sigurd, whom king Olaf Tryggvi's son christened and all the folk in the
Orkneys.&nbsp; This Sigurd fell in Brian's battle in Ireland.&nbsp; The mother
of those two Paul and Erlend was Ingibj&ouml;rg, who was called earlsmother, the
daughter of earl Finn Arni's son;&nbsp; but Harold Sigurd's son had to wife
Thora the daughter of Thorberg Arni's son, the mother of Olaf the quiet, and in
that way they were second cousins, king Olaf and the aforesaid earls.&nbsp;
Earl Erlend had to wife that woman whose name was Thora, she was Summerled's
daughter, the son of Ospak.&nbsp; The mother of Ospak was Thordis the daughter
of Hall of the Side.&nbsp; Egill was the name of a son of the aforenamed
Hall;&nbsp; his daughter was Thorgerda, the mother of Saint John, bishop of
Holar.&nbsp; The sons of earl Erlend and Thora were these, Saint Magnus and
Erling, but their daughters were Gunnhilda and Cecilia.&nbsp; Kol Kali's son, a
liegeman in Norway, afterwards had Gunnhilda to wife;&nbsp; their son was
Rognvald-Kali, who became afterwards earl in the Orkneys;&nbsp; he is a
thoroughly saintly man;&nbsp; Rognvald-Kali was a sister's son of earl Magnus the
Saint.&nbsp; Earl Paul the brother of Erlend had to wife a daughter of earl
Hacon Ivar's son and Ragnhilda the daughter of king Magnus the good, son of the
saint-king Olaf.&nbsp; Paul's son's name was Hacon, who afterwards comes into
the story.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saint
Magnus the earl was born in the Orkneys, the most noble of race and the most
famous of kindred.&nbsp; His father Erlend was earl of the Orkneys, a
worshipful lord and chief, honoured in power and esteem, as is the wont of
those who live mightily on this earth.&nbsp; His mother Thora was sprung from
the most noble chiefs of that land.&nbsp; But though to many good birth might
turn to pride and spoiling of temper, this blessed youth was already in the
first offshoot of his childhood bright and learned by the teaching of the Holy
Spirit;&nbsp; for he held to and loved, valued and kept, the highest power of
the mind, sweetness of temper and soberness of morals, and the steadiness of
honourable habits.&nbsp; This youth showed himself old in good behaviour,
shareless of childish life in his deeds, gladspoken and blithe, gentle in his
loving words, and yielding and reasonable in his conduct and in all his
doings.&nbsp; Well mature and self restrained, so that nothing was found in his
dealings that might hurt or shock men who beheld him.&nbsp; He was soon put to
school to learn holy writings, and all that other knowledge which men were then
most wont to know.&nbsp; Magnus was docile and obedient, pliant and attentive
to his father and mother and his masters;&nbsp; kind and pleasant to the whole
people.&nbsp; He cared little for loose company and&nbsp; games like other
young men, but rather showed himself of seemly conduct, though he were young in
the tale of winters;&nbsp; because at once was revealed in him the evident gift
of the Holy Spirit, which guided him to all good things.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
those brothers, Paul and Erlend, had taken the power in the Orkneys, king
Harold Sigurd's son, came from the east from Norway with a mighty host to the
Orkney's and left there behind him queen Elizabeth, and Maria and Ingigerda his
daughters.&nbsp; The earls made them ready to go along with the king with a
great host, and they held on south for England;&nbsp; and in that battle which
they fought against king Harold Godwin's son, Harold Sigurd's son fell five
nights after the feast of St. Matthew in the autumn.&nbsp; After this battle
Olaf the quiet, Harold's son, sailed with the earls that autumn back to the
Orkneys.&nbsp; And that same day and at that hour on which king Harold fell in
England, his daughter Maria died a sudden death in the Orkneys;&nbsp; and it is
the saying of men that they both had one life between them.&nbsp; Olaf the
quiet was the winter over in the Orkneys, and he was the dearest friend of the
earls his kinsmen, for they were brothers' daughters, Thora the mother of Olaf
and Ingibj&ouml;rg the mother of the earls.&nbsp; Olaf fared in the spring east to
Norway, and there he was taken to be king with his (brother) Magnus.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those
brothers, Paul and Erlend, ruled the Orkneys a long while, and their agreement
was a long time good.&nbsp; But when their sons began to grow up, then Hacon
and Erling got to be very overbearing men, but Magnus was the quietest and best
behaved of them in every way.&nbsp; All those kinsmen were tall and strong, and
proper men in all things.&nbsp; Hacon, Paul's son, wished to be ruler over the
sons of Erlend, because he thought himself greater by birth than they;&nbsp;
for that he was the daughter's son of earl Hacon, Ivar's son, and Ragnhilda,
the daughter of king Magnus the good, as was shown before, and Hacon would have
the higher hand in all their dealings.&nbsp; Then it so fell out, that they
could not agree peacefully together, for many men leaned towards the sons of
Erlend, and would not let them bear the lower lot there in the isles;&nbsp; for
they were better friends with all the people and more beloved of men;&nbsp;
Hacon harboured many a grudge for this all his life long.&nbsp; So then there
was risk with the earl's sons.&nbsp; Then their fathers took part in the matter
with them, that they should make things up.&nbsp; Then a meeting was
summoned;&nbsp; and it was soon found out&nbsp; that each of the earls leaned
towards his sons, and they could not agree;&nbsp; thenceforth arose great
discord between those brothers, and they parted as things stood.&nbsp; Then
next after that men came between them to try to make peace, and then a meeting
was summoned between them in Hrossey.&nbsp; At that meeting peace was agreed to
between them on these terms, that the isles were shared into halves;&nbsp; then
things stood so for a while.&nbsp; Hacon Paul's son pressed hard on those men
who served Erlend and his sons, so that they thought things could not stand
thus, and so it came about again that they became at variance, and marched
against one another with a great force.&nbsp; Havard Gunni's son and other
chiefs and friends of the earls then tried to bring about an atonement between
them;&nbsp; but Erlend and his sons would not then take any terms, so that
Hacon should be there in the isles.&nbsp; But for that their friends thought
that there was much to answer for if they were at variance, then Hacon fared
away out of the isles at once;&nbsp; and then an atonement was brought about
between those brothers by the counsel of good men and true.&nbsp; Hacon fared
first east to Norway to see king Olaf the quiet, that was toward the end of his
days;&nbsp; there he stayed a short while.&nbsp; Thence he fared east to Sweden
to see king Ingi Steinkel's son, and was with him some while well
received.&nbsp; Then christianity was young in Sweden;&nbsp; there were many
men there who went about with witchcraft, and so thought that they would become
wiser as to many things which had not yet come to pass.&nbsp; King Ingi was a
good christian, and took great pains in rooting out those bad customs which had
long followed heathendom.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
Hacon Paul's son was in Sweden, he had heard say that there in the land was a
man who went about with wisdom and spaedom, whether it were by witchcraft or
other things.&nbsp; Hacon had a great longing to find out this man, and to know
whether he could be made wise as to his future fate.&nbsp; Then he fared to
look for that man, and found him at last in a woodland district;&nbsp; there he
used to go about to feasts, and told the freemen about their crops and other
things which they were curious to know.&nbsp; But when Hacon found that man,
then he asked him how he might come to power or other good luck.&nbsp; The
wizard asks him what manner of man he might be.&nbsp; He tells him his name and
kin, that he was the daughter's son of earl Hacon Ivar's son.&nbsp; Then
answers the wizard:&nbsp; "Why wilt thou get from me wisdom or
sayings?&nbsp; Knowest thou not that those former kinsmen of thine have had
little faith in such like men as I am.&nbsp; And it may serve thy turn that
thou shouldest seek to know thy fate from Olaf the Stout, in Norway, thy
kinsman, whom ye set all faith in.&nbsp; But I rather doubt that he would not
have lowly mindedness enought to tell thee what thou art eager to know, or
perhaps be not so powerful either as ye say he is."&nbsp; Hacon
answers:&nbsp; "I will not blame him;&nbsp; I think it more likely that I
may not have worthiness enough to get wisdom from him, than that he should not
be able to make me wise, if he would.&nbsp; But this is why I have come to see
thee, because it hath come into my mind that here neither of us twain will need
to look down upon the other for the sake of matters of virtue or
belief."&nbsp; That man answers:&nbsp; "It likes me well that I find
that thou dost not think that thou hast all trust where thy kinsmen of yore had
faith.&nbsp; Wonderful it is, too, that those men who strive after such things
go about with fasts and wakes, and deem that therefore those things must be granted
to them which they are eager to know.&nbsp; But though ye take such pains, yet
are ye all the less wise the more curious ye are to know those things which it
is worth your while to know;&nbsp; but we lay ourselves under no torments, and
yet we are always wise as to those things of which our friends think it worth
while to know.&nbsp; Now things will so go with us two that thou shalt get
thyself better able to get the truth from me than from king Ingi's priestly
teachers, whom he thinks he may put all trust in.&nbsp; Thou shalt come to me
in three nights' space, and then we two will try if I can tell thee any of
these things which thou art eager to know."&nbsp; After that they parted,
and Hacon stayed there in those parts.&nbsp; And when three nights were gone by
he fared to meet the wizard.&nbsp; He was then in a certain house all alone,
and drew his breath heavily when he [Hacon] went in, and stroked his brow with
his hand, and said it had cost him much ere he became wise of those things
which he wished to know beforehand.&nbsp; Hacon said he was then willing to
hear what he had to say.&nbsp; He then said:&nbsp; "If thou wilt know thy
fate, then is it long to tell about, and about thy life;&nbsp; for that from
thy voyage west to the Orkneys very great tidings will come to pass when everything
hath been fulfilled which will follow from it.&nbsp; And it is my belief that
thou wilt come to be sole chief over the Orkneys in the end;&nbsp; may be that
thou wilt think it long.&nbsp; I trow also that thy offspring will dwell
there.&nbsp; Thou wilt also in thy days let that wickedness be done, which thou
must either make atonement for or not to that God in whom thou believest.&nbsp;
But thy footsteps lie further out into the world than I can get to see;&nbsp;
but still I think that thou wilt bring back thy bones here to the northern half
of the world.&nbsp; Now have I told thee those things that I can at this time,
but say thou how thou likest thy lot or errand."&nbsp; Hacon
answers:&nbsp; "A great story is this thou tellest, if it be sooth;
but&nbsp; I think it will go better with me, as it may well be that thou hast
not seen all this of a truth."&nbsp; The spaeman bade him believe as much
of it as he chose.&nbsp; And after that they parted.</p>

<p>And when Hacon had been a short time with king Ingi, then he fared thence to
Norway to see king Magnus barelegs his kinsman.&nbsp; There he learned those
tidings from the Orkneys, that earl Erlend and his sons had most of the rule
there, and were very much beloved, but earl Paul his father had very little
share in the rule.&nbsp; He thought too that he made out that the Orkneyingers
would long little for his coming thither west;&nbsp; then they had good peace,
and feared, if Hacon came, that from him would arise strife and uproar;&nbsp;
and Hacon thought it not unlikely that his kinsmen would hold the realm against
him.&nbsp; He took that counsel to ask from his kinsman king Magnus, that he
would put him into his realm in the Orkneys.&nbsp; Hacon egged king Magnus on
much to lead a host to Scotland and Ireland, and after that to England, to
avenge there king Harold Sigurd's son.&nbsp; The king answers:&nbsp; "That
must thou bear in mind, Hacon, if I do this for the sake of thy words, to fare
with a host across the sea west, that it shall not take thee unawares though I
bore on with a bold claim to those lands which lie there west across the main,
and make there no distinction of persons."&nbsp; But when Hacon heard that
he grew cold, and said little more about it;&nbsp; but king Magnus then made
them call out the levies in full numbers of men and ships over all Norway.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
next after this we must turn back to the holy Magnus the hero of our
Saga;&nbsp; for a little before ye heard how virtuous he was in all his
behaviour, and unlike other young men in his growing up.&nbsp; But for that
many turn their customs after those with whom they live, and whosoever toucheth
tar is defiled of it;&nbsp; so when Magnus had come to be about fullgrown of
age, placed among grim and wicked men who were illwilled against good habits,
unstable in the faith, opposed to right laws, stiff-necked in learning,
yielding to evil habits, gainsayers and disobedient to God's
commandments;&nbsp; he seemed for some winters like wicked men, and as a viking
with robbers and warriors he lived by robbery and plunder, and stood by at
manslaughters along with others.&nbsp; But it is to be believed that he did
this more from the wickedness and egging on of bad men than from his own
badness.&nbsp; Men think it likeliest that Magnus did this at that time when he
and Hacon and Erling his kinsmen were all together in the Orkneys, for
afterwards no time can be found for it.&nbsp; About this his behaviour master
Robert thus speaks, who has composed the story.</p>

<p>"Ho ho!&nbsp; I wonder,"&nbsp; says he, "how unspeakable is
the deepness of the riches of godly knowledge and of the Lord's wisdom;&nbsp;
how inexplicable are his decrees, and how inscrutable are his ways to the race
of man.&nbsp; Why did the allruling God allow this his servant to let himself
be greedy for robbery and manslaughter, and to be defiled by so manifold sins
and misdeeds?&nbsp; Why did God's goodness suffer his knight and martyr to let
himself fall so fearfully, which from the beginning elected to crown him
sublimely in heaven?&nbsp; With joy and gladness God enriched him, and turned
his dust into heavenly glory, and gave him everlasting comfort after this
world's woe;&nbsp; the cloak of good fortune and praise after the stripes of
the heart.&nbsp; What is this?&nbsp; but that which we have seen every day as
manifestly as gloriously, that God raises up and makes sons to Abraham out of
stones, righteous out of wrong-doers, honest out of sinners, glorious out of
mortals --- (stones) smooth and polished, and four-cornered, with four main
virtues, that they may be made to fit into the heavenly edifice, as strong and
steadfast cornerstones in Jesus Christ our head stone of the corner;&nbsp; of
one mind with him, and of the same temper with everlasting affection and the
link of endless love.&nbsp; For the Lord Jesus is the son of the great builder,
who made and makes the world, and all that is therein, and rules it after his
will;&nbsp; and he changes the vessels of his wrath into vessels of mercy, polishing
them with the file of the Holy Spirit;&nbsp; and he receives sinful men into
the widest bosom of his pity and mercy, all those who leave off their
naughtiness and turn to him with their whole heart.&nbsp; For it belongs to the
great glory and mercy of the Lord that he lets the abundance of his mercy there
be shown, where before the great weight of our wretchedness is in the
way;&nbsp; and he tendeth and healeth all the more powerfully when the sickness
already more hotly attacks the sick man, and he makes them all whole and holpen
who look to him for help.&nbsp; See at last, how the holy Magnus, though he was
entangled in such sins, yet came to leave off those pursuits, and followed his
father and brother and the liegemen in the Orkneys."</p>

<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that
time which we have reached in the story of king Magnus barelegs came from the
east out of Norway, with a countless multitude of ships and force of
warriors.&nbsp; Him followed many of his liegemen;&nbsp; Vidkun Johnson, Sark
of Sogn, Kali of Agdir the son of Seabear, and Kol his son, and many other
chiefs.&nbsp; The king meant in this voyage to lay under him and to harry the
western lands, England and Ireland, as was before mentioned.&nbsp; When king
Magnus came to the Orkneys, he seized the earls Erlend and Paul, and forced
them away from the isles, and sent them east to Norway;&nbsp; but he set his
son Sigurd over the Orkneys, and gave him councillors, for he was not older
than nine winters.&nbsp; King Magnus settled that the sons of the earls should
fare with and attend him;&nbsp; Magnus and Erling the sons of Erlend, and Hacon
Paul's son.&nbsp; Magnus the son of earl Erlend was a tall man of growth, quick
and gallant, and strong of body, fair to look on, lighthued, and well-limbed,
noble in aspect, and the most courteous in all his behaviour;&nbsp; him king Magnus
made his waiting-swain, and he always served at the king's board.&nbsp; King
Magnus fared out of the Orkneys to the Southern isles, and he won in that
voyage all the Southern Isles under his sway, and seized Logman the son of
Godred, king of the Southern isles.&nbsp; Thence he fared south under Wales,
and had there a great battle in Anglesea-sound, with two Welch earls, Hugh the
stout, and Hugh the proud.&nbsp; But when men were getting out their weapons,
and busked them to battle, then Magnus Erlend's son sat him down in the foreroom,
where he was wont to be, and did not arm himself.&nbsp; The king asked him why
he did so.&nbsp; Saint Magnus answers, "I have here no quarrel with any
man, and that is why I will not fight."&nbsp; "Get away then,"
says the king, "down under the planks, but do not lie here under the feet
of men if thou darest not to fight, for I do not think that faith drives thee
to do this."&nbsp; Magnus the earl's son sat in the same place, and took a
psalter, and sung out of it during the battle, but did not shield himself.&nbsp;
This battle was both hard and long.&nbsp; But at last Hugh the proud fell, but
the Welchmen fled, and king Magnus got the victory, but he had lost many good
men, and a number were wounded.&nbsp; Kali Seabear's son had got many and great
wounds.&nbsp; Magnus the son of Erlend had not been wounded in the battle,
though he had not shielded himself, and all may see that it was the fairest
token that in so thick flights of arrows, and strong showers of shafts, he
should not be wounded, though on all sides of him armed men fell.&nbsp; And now
this need not be wondered at, for God has kept him for a greater crown and
victory than to fall there.&nbsp; King Magnus was not moved by aught of these
things, and he laid great feud and dislike on Magnus the earl's son for
this.&nbsp; And when saint Magnus saw that it would neither be for his honour
nor for his soul's help to be any longer with king Magnus, then he took another
counsel for himself to do that which God taught him.</p>

<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It fell on a night when king Magnus
lay off Scotland, that Magnus Erlend's son stole off from the king's ship, and
so made up his berth that it seemed as though a man lay there.&nbsp; But next
morning when the king was clad, he asked whether Magnus Erlend's son were
sick.&nbsp; Then enquiry was made for him, and he was missed.&nbsp; The king
made them look for him, and still he was not found. &nbsp;Then the king let the
slot hounds run loose on land.&nbsp; Magnus, the earl's son had hurt his foot
when he was running on land, and the slot-hounds had found the trail at
once.&nbsp; Magnus had taken to the wood, and he had got up into a tree.&nbsp;
The hounds came to the oak, and stood upon their hindlegs round it.&nbsp; Then
Magnus smote one of them with a staff, which he had hold of, but they betook
them to flight at once, and laid their tails behind them, and ran off to the
ships.&nbsp; Magnus Erlend's son hid himself in the wood while the king's men
hunted for him.&nbsp; After that he fared up the country, and came forth at the
court of Malcolm, the Scot-king, and stayed there awhile, but sometimes he was
in Wales with a certain bishop.&nbsp; That same autumn king Magnus fared back
to the Southern isles, and was there the winter over.&nbsp; That winter Kali
Seabear's son breathed his last of his wounds.&nbsp; Next spring, early, king
Magnus fared to the Orkneys.&nbsp; There he heard of the deaths of the earls
out of Norway;&nbsp; Erlend had died in Drontheim, and was there buried, but
Paul at Bergen.&nbsp; Then king Magnus gave away in marriage Gunnhilda, earl
Erlend's daughter, the sister of Saint Magnus, to Kol the son of Kali, as an
atonement for the loss of his father, together with great possessions in the
Orkneys.&nbsp; Then Kol became the liegeman of the king;&nbsp; their son was
Rognvald-Kali.&nbsp; Some men say that Erling, the son of Erlend, brother of
Saint Magnus, has fallen in Anglesea-sound, but Snorri Sturluson says he has
fallen in Ulster with king Magnus.&nbsp; For when king Magnus had ruled Norway
nine winters, he fared west to Ireland with a great host, and the summer after
he fell in Ulster on the feast of Saint Bartholomew.&nbsp; But Sigurd his son
fared straightway out of the Orkneys east to Norway, and was there taken to be
king with his brothers Eystein and Olaf.</p>

<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now ye heard in the former
chapter how Almighty God is ready to have mercy, whose especial goodness is
ever to pity and to turn trouble to comfort and help;&nbsp; and how he kept
this his chosen champion from the woes and worry of the world, to reveal to
him, and to show him how great things it behoved him to suffer for his
name;&nbsp; and that he who had often stood by at great manslayings, should at
last become an offering of the Holy Spirit, and give to God his own blood with
life and body.&nbsp; And that was why he came out of the power of the greedy
king as was read before.</p>

<p>When the holy Magnus was in Scotland he learnt the death of earl Erlend his
father, and those other tidings which before were written.&nbsp; And when he
had been such time at the court of the Scot-king as liked him, honoured of the
king with gifts and noble company, he fared to Caithness, and was there
worthily received of all, kept and cared for, and at once chosen and honoured
with the title "earl," beloved and worshipful to all the friends of
God.</p>

<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And next to that without
tarrying the saint earl Magnus became Paul out of Saul, a preacher out of a
manslayer, and he avenged it on himself that he had lived an ill life.&nbsp; He
fell to weeping himself dead to sin with daily wailing and steadfast
remorse;&nbsp; and he now took fitting vengeance in manifold penance on the
sinful lusts of his wretched flesh.&nbsp; Then he seemed to become a new man,
who is changed into what is honourable to God;&nbsp; and he turned into another
man, into a good from a bad man, into a sober from a sinful, into a saint from
a sinner, into a blessed and pure man from a defiled man.&nbsp; This is the
conversion of thy right hand, Almighty God.&nbsp; Thou art strong to
strengthen, gracious to help, ready to better, excellent to keep.&nbsp; In this
wise was the holy Magnus changed into a saintly man.&nbsp; He began to ear the
earth of his heart with the sharp share of confession.&nbsp; Then he slew his unlucky
adversary and hid him under the sand.&nbsp; Then he buried Laban's idols under
the treeroots.&nbsp; He tore up out of himself sins and defilements, and clad
him in sublime strength in godly desires with manful steadfastness.&nbsp; Then
he began to wax as an olivetree, and was uplifted in all good things and worthy
works.&nbsp; Just as the cypress is above other trees, so waxed the holy
Magnus, that he might be as "magnus," that is
"great,"&nbsp; in godliness, as he was in name, uprising in good
fortune and holiness.</p>

<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One winter or two after the
fall of king Magnus barelegs, Hacon Paul's son came from the west across the
sea to Norway, and the king gave him the title of earl and such power as his
birth might claim.&nbsp; Then he fared west over the sea, and took under him
all the realm in the Orkneys with so much greed and aggression that he slew the
guiltless steward of the king of Norway, who held and looked after that half of
the isles which Saint Magnus owned, and in that way laid under him all the
Orkneys with violence;&nbsp; for half the isles fell to Saint Magnus by
inheritance from his father.&nbsp; Now when Saint Magnus heard of such tumult,
that his first cousin Hacon was taking under him his inheritance with open
wrong, he held counsel with his men what should be done.&nbsp; It was agreed
with them that he shall bide for a time till the wrath and greed of his kinsman
Hacon were soothed, and that it should not be shown that he sought his
inheritance after warriors' wise, but rather as the friend and dear lover of
law and justice.</p>

<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when that time is come
that Saint Magnus will seek his heritage, then he fares with a goodly company
from Caithness to the Orkneys, and friends and kinsmen are alike glad to see
him.&nbsp; Then he begged to take his father's heritage.&nbsp; That was well
pleasing to the freemen, for he was blessed with many friends;&nbsp; he had
many kinsmen and connexions who were ready to support him to power.&nbsp; His
mother Thora was then married to that man whose name was Sigurd, they had a
great homestead in Paplay.&nbsp; When earl Hacon heard that Magnus was come
into the isles, he gathered force to him, and would not give up the realm, but
rather defend it.&nbsp; Then the friends of both came between them and tried to
reconcile them.&nbsp; Then it so came about by the help of good men and true,
that it was agreed that earl Hacon sould give up half the realm, if that were
the award of the kings of Norway.&nbsp; Then Magnus Erlend's son fared at once
east to Norway to seek king Eystein, for king Sigurd had then set out for
Jewry.&nbsp; King Eystein received lord Magnus excellently well, and gave up to
him his father's inheritance, half the Orkneys, and with that he took the title
of earl from the king, together with the most honourable gifts.&nbsp; And after
that lord Magnus the earl fared west over the sea to his realm;&nbsp; and his
friends and kinsfolk, and along with them all the people were fain of
him.&nbsp; Then the kinship of Hacon and Magnus was very close many winters, so
long as their friends took part in it.&nbsp; There was then peace and plenty in
the Orkneys while their friendship lasted.&nbsp; Those kinsmen, lord Magnus the
earl and Hacon, had both together the wardship of the land for some while, so
that they were well agreed.&nbsp; It is so said in those songs which have been
made on them, that they fought with that viking who harried their realm, whose
name was Dufnjal;&nbsp; he was one degree further off than the earl's first
cousin, and he fell before them.&nbsp; Thorbjorn was the name of a man mighty
and noble for family's sake, but poor in good works, whom they cut off in
Burrafirth in Shetland for good cause.&nbsp; And again they wrought many
tidings which the songs point to, that they shared both together, though we
cannot speak plainly of them.&nbsp; These things Saint Magnus hath done not as
a viking or robber, but rather as lawful ruler of the realm and a keeper of the
laws, the lover of peace, to restrain bad customs of men and to chastise
wrongdoing, to free and relieve his subjects and his realm from the pride and
onslaughts of wicked men, who aye lay in wait to spoil the peace.</p>

<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Magnus was the most
famous man in his chieftainship, of good habits and counsel, a fast friend and
bold in fight, well skilled in arms, and victorious in battle, meek-tempered in
peace, and yet fit to rule, humble in speech and merciful, a sage in wit, and
having the praise of every one.&nbsp; He was generous of money, and open-handed
to chiefs, he gave daily great help to poor men for God's love.&nbsp; He
chastised much plunder and stealing, he let vikings and ill-doers be slain, as
well powerful as poor.&nbsp; He was not given to side with his friends in his
judgments;&nbsp; he set more store by God's law than the distinctions of
rank.&nbsp; In all things he kept firmly God's commandments, and was unsparing
towards himself.&nbsp; Many and famous were his virtues which he showed to God
himself but hid from men.</p>

<p>But for that the earl Saint Magnus had rule and government over worldly
folk, so he would be like worldly chiefs in the customs of this life;&nbsp; he
took and betrothed unto himself a high-born lady and the purest maid of the
noblest stock of Scotland's chiefs, and brought her home to him, and entered
into wedlock with her.&nbsp; This the blessed Magnus did, as it was proved, by
the deep-set plan of godly mercy, for the sake of damping the lusts of his
body, for he was holpen by godly mercy, for the sake of damping the blithe
temptations of this world, rather than to fulfil the lusts of his body, for he
was holpen by godly guardianship and heavenly power.&nbsp; He abode ten winters
by this maid pure and thoroughly lotless of all sins of defilement.&nbsp; But
when he felt temptation coming on him to bodily lusts, then he went into cold
water and prayed for help from God.</p>

<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See here the stout champion of
God in daily strife, how wondrously he lived with this maiden so long
time.&nbsp; For that, though he might lawfully take pleasure with her, he would
rather, stayed by the mercy of God, choose the better lot to live unspoilt,
than to fulfil lawful wedlock;&nbsp; for they suffer the burning passions of
the body who follow such things.&nbsp; Because it is better and more steadfast
to keep flowers safe, than to cure those which are already spoilt;&nbsp; for no
wound is as well healed as that flesh which has been kept whole.&nbsp; But to
live in the body without the body's lusts, is not of man's power, but rather of
God's gift.&nbsp; But what temptation and suffering he bore from the heat of
the body, what heavy shafts of unlawful feeling, and in what hard strife he
overcame and steadied the strong desires of glowing flesh, he knows who tries,
but he that is untried doubts.&nbsp; See my dearest!&nbsp; this is that great
sight which Moses saw, that bush blazing and not burning;&nbsp; that is so to
be understood, this young man tempted but not overcome.&nbsp; But for that the
apostle Paul so says that no one is crowned save he lawfully strives and
manfully works for it, so this courtly chief and warlike knight chose thy
courts, ["Thy courts" i.e. "God's courts."] to suffer daily
strife, and the constant battle of the burning flesh.&nbsp; And he fought
stoutly and conquered luckily, for it seemed to him that he will be too much a
carpet knight who will first have the glory ere he accomplishes some doughty
deed;&nbsp; for might is the way to glory and false is that fairness which holy
strength does not bring forth.&nbsp; And I wonder, says the scripture, how fair
and desirable is pure begetting with its brightness and loveliness.&nbsp; This
the exalted knight of God, girt with the belt of chastity, took pains with all
the desire of his heart to further and fulfil all kinds of loving works to the
honour of his Lord.&nbsp; For what could he refuse of this world's goods to his
God, who gave his own life and body in pledge, and poured out his own blood for
God's sake?</p>

<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, for that no man can be
Abel, save he who tholes and proves the spite and envy of Cain;&nbsp; and as
the holy Ezekiel dwelt with venomous men, and the righteous Lot was hard
pressed of wrongful men;&nbsp; so the foe of the whole human race waked up
temptation, and the heat of persecution on all sides against this knight of
God, sowing discord and hatred between brothers and kinsfolk and dear friends,
all that he might hinder him, and make those wonders of none effect, which then
began to grow with him.&nbsp; But the branch of the godly vine might be moved,
but not cut off;&nbsp; for as wood floats on water, and is turned over and over
by the winds and waves, but sinks not, and just as "the Wain" [i.e.,
'Charles' Wain," the Bear, the well-known constellation.] turns round in
the heaven, but never sets;&nbsp; as gold is purified in the furnace, and burns
not;&nbsp; and as a strong house is shaken of the storm and falls not:&nbsp;
after that wise was the will and heart of this famous martyr strong and
steadfast, unshaken and fearless amid the hot onslaughts and onset of manifold
temptation, in the midst of storms and great breakers of hidden envy and guile,
as well as of open wickedness and ill-will, against the shafts of the tempting
foe. --- Next after this it must be shown in what wise this discord came about
between the earls.</p>

<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When those kinsmen, Saint
Magnus and earl Hacon, had ruled the land some winters with peace and good
agreement, then that fell about which can often happen, that ill-willing men
set themselves to spoil their kinship.&nbsp; Then wicked men gathered
themselves around earl Hacon, for those kinsmen were very unlike in
temper.&nbsp; The lord earl Magnus was good-hearted and trusty in his
promises;&nbsp; he wished to hold the power that God had given him, and coveted
naught beyond.&nbsp; For in what wise could he be proved to be greedy of other
men's power or property, who was so free of his own body, that he spared not
his own life for the love of God?&nbsp; He schooled and taught his subjects to
right conduct, so that after he had freed and saved his realm from the
onslaughts of wicked vikings, he allowed none of his men to go on warfare, and
sternly restrained all lawlessness and wickedness.&nbsp; But earl Hacon was
hard-hearted and grim, greedy both of money and power, and more prone to egg on
his men to warfare than to hinder them;&nbsp; but wickedness and ill-doing he
punished little.&nbsp; He was very envious at the friendships and lordliness of
saint Magnus;&nbsp; Hacon would willingly, with the greediness of his bad
counsellors, hinder the honour of earl Magnus, and lay under him his realm by
wrong and robbery, and Hacon began with his men to plot against his life with
guileful schemes.</p>

<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when the blessed Magnus
has become thoroughly aware of this by many proofs, which he thinks cannot be
hidden, that Hacon wished to get at his life and realm, then he took counsel
with his advisers, and it seemed good to him to yield for a while to the envy
and wrath of Hacon.&nbsp; He chose then out of his men those who were choicest
and best fitted to follow him, and sailed to England and sought a meeting with
king Henry son of William the bastard, who at that time was absolute king over
England.&nbsp; When saint Magnus was come to this king, then he laid bare to
him all the story and cause of his coming thither.&nbsp; And the king received
him with great worship.&nbsp; And he rose up into such great friendship with
the king, that he kept him and all his band at his own cost a whole twelvemonth
nobly, as it beseemed a king to treat a noble duke.&nbsp; But this holy martyr
kept himself and his followers so wisely that he was ware of and set his face
against all fellowship with wicked men.&nbsp; And when the lord king skilled of
his wisdom how earl Magnus was a doer of good works and of honourable habits,
and that the Holy Spirit abode in him, then he listened willingly to his
counsels, and had his foresight in his undertakings;&nbsp; for he was sound and
safe in his discourse and counsels, blithe-hearted and long-suffering like
Chusi, merry and loveable like Jonathan, a righteous zealot for the law like
Phineas.&nbsp; He was so dear and so beloved by all, so pleasant and popular,
that there were many who so spoke:&nbsp; "Blessed are they that saw thee,
and who flourished in thy friendship."&nbsp; He was gladsome and of good
will towards great men, open-handed and liberal towards the poor, good-tempered
and good-hearted and lowly-minded to all the people.&nbsp; And though he took
his place at the court with wordly chiefs, still he was beware of and set his
face against all kinds of lust, which spoil the habits of courtiers.&nbsp; And
that he might not for the future fleck his chastity by consorting with other
men's sins, he made ready to return home, as soon as those twelve months were
past, which he had spent with king Henry.&nbsp; May be that God had revealed to
him that he should close his toils within a short time, and so offer to God the
pure flower of his chastity, by the triumphant death of his martyrdom.&nbsp;
For to be set free from the body, and live with Christ, is far more glorious
than to be here in the defilement of this world.</p>

<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that Saint Magnus had taken
leave of king Henry, honoured and esteemed with rich gifts of many kinds,
reverenced of the lord king, then they parted with the greatest love and
friendship.&nbsp; Then he first visited all those holy shrines which were in
the neighbourhood, and afterwards fared home to his own land.&nbsp; But during
that time when the holy Magnus was abroad, earl Hacon laid under his rule with
great greed and warfare not only all the Orkneys, but all Caithness as well,
with robbery and wantoness;&nbsp; whence it came about that Hacon sat at that
time in Caithness when the holy earl Magnus landed in the Orkneys with five
ships well manned with bold and well-armed men, meaning to get back his realm,
albeit with no wrong greed of this world's honour or of property which did not
belong to him;&nbsp; least of all when he had already so long yearned for God,
and was with the whole joy of his heart taken up from the greed of mortal
things into the desire of eternal joys;&nbsp; and so he came now in a little
while to close his lifetime all the more worthily as he went sooner away.&nbsp;
These tidings of his homecoming were soon heard on all sides.&nbsp; Earl Hacon
eftsoons awakening as a grim she-bear robbed of her cubs, gathering together
and summoning to him the sons of Belial, wicked ill-doers, and sons of the bad
Dohet, who aye and aye wrought evil from the day they were born of their
mother's womb.&nbsp; Hacon then meant to come unawares upon the holy Magnus, to
work out and fulfil there and then his evil greed and the treachery which he
already long had kept harboured in his heart.&nbsp; But the highest Heaven-king,
who from the everlasting beginning determined that he would keep that his
glorious chosen vessel among his treasures, saw in his chosen man still some
rust of worldly behaviour that was to be cleansed away.&nbsp; For the God would
that he should be cleansed and purified within a few days with the fire of
suffering and insult, and with the frost of temptation and much opposition,
though there were no mortal sins to wash off him.&nbsp; Then would God increase
his worthiness if aught were lacking in it, that in the same proportion as his
temptation and struggle were more and harder so the glory and bliss of the
conqueror should be higher and more sublime.&nbsp; For that, it so came about
that the earls sent with messages between them for peace and atonement their&nbsp;
most trusty counsellors, who rightly betoken Chusi and Ahitophel, who brought
about the atonement between king David and Absolom his son when they had fallen
out.&nbsp; So at last this matter, by the intervention of good men, was so
settled, that there an atonement was formed between those kinsmen in this wise,
that the earldom of the Orkneys, Caithness, and Shetland should be equally
divided between earls Magnus and Hacon;&nbsp; neither of them was to attack the
other's realm with any greed.&nbsp; When this agreement had been settled and
strengthened with oaths and hansels, then the earls met with the kiss of
peace.&nbsp; But what saint Magnus thought to be peace, that Hacon turned to
guile and plotting;&nbsp; and the longer he kept down the venom of his badness,
the more basely he spewed it up;&nbsp; for his badness and villainy came forth
with great force at the time when he could no longer hide it.&nbsp; In the same
way as boils on the face give a man by so much the more pain as they be longer
hidden in it, so fares it with all kinds of badness;&nbsp; the longer it
festers in heart and mind, the grimmer it grows to do harm.</p>

<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy Magnus then began
again to rule his realm with peace and joy for some time, and that is most in
God's sight how holily he lived in this biding-tide of his death;&nbsp; how he
clothed himself with sublime force, and in forwarding all kinds of virtue, in
prayers and shedding of tears, and in repentance of heart, in chastity and
soberness, in almsgiving and all goodness towards his subjects, in almsgiving
and all goddness towards his subjects, in penance and manifold sufferings which
he bore on his body, and many more other good deeds than sinful man can call to
mind.&nbsp; In the way in which God's saints do, in that way saint Magnus made
him ready for his martyrdom, the telling of which we will next after this begin
by God's will.</p>

<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the aforesaid atonement and
peace had been kept between the earls for some winters, then Hacon showed
himself a traitor, pouring forth out of his breast great wrongfulness, which he
had up to that time held back.&nbsp; Hearken how sooth is the judgment of the
old poet so saying: ---- "Nulla fides regni sociis, omnisque
potestas&nbsp; Inpatiens consortis erit, totum sitit illa."&nbsp; Which
says this:&nbsp; "Never can fellowship in this world's power be safe, for
all rulers can bear no rivals, and will alone have all."&nbsp; By this ye
may skill what kind of fruit guile brings forth, and what growths spring up of
greed.&nbsp; All sins come of covetousness, and all unlawful desires proceed
from greediness.&nbsp; That was proved with Ahab the most wrongful king, who
persecuted Elias the prophet.&nbsp; That was shown by the most wicked Judas,
who sold our Lord for a price.&nbsp; The very same showed the traitor earl
Hacon, both by examples and plain proofs in that treachery by which he beguiled
his kinsman earl Magnus who trusted in him, though the events which led to
their dealings and quarrel happened in sundry ways.</p>

<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two men were they with earl Hacon
who are named as having been the worst of all in going between those kinsmen;&nbsp;
the one's name was Sigurd, and the other Sighvat sock.&nbsp; Sigurd had a
brother hight Thorstein, who was the doughtiest follower of earl Magnus.&nbsp;
There were many others who had a bad share in those matters, and these were all
with Hacon, for saint Magnus would not keep any backbiters in his
following.&nbsp; These backbitings came to such a length that the earls drew
force together and fared each against the other with a very great
company.&nbsp; They both held on for Hrossey, for that was the place of meeting
of the Orkneyingers.&nbsp; But when they came thither, then either side drew
them up in array and busked them to battle.&nbsp; Then there had come together
there all the great men with the earls, and many were friends of both, who did
all they could to set them at one, and went between them with manliness and
good will.&nbsp; This meeting was in Lent.&nbsp; But for that many men their
well wishers took part in hindering difficulties between them, but would stand
by neither to do the other a mischief, then they bound this their agreement
with oaths and handsels, at the witness of the best men.&nbsp; It was so
settled that they should meet in the spring at Egelsha (Egils-ey) after
Easter.&nbsp; At this meeting each of the earls was to have two ships, and just
as many men as the other.&nbsp; Both the earls bound that with oaths to have
and to hold those terms of agreement which the best men should settle to utter
between them at that meeting.&nbsp; And when this had been done each fared back
to his home again.&nbsp; This preliminary of agreement and concord liked the
holy Magnus right well, as he was thoroughly whole-hearted and of good
conscience without all mistrust.&nbsp; But earl Hacon at this meeting had
veiled his treachery and covered it with the cloud of falsehood;&nbsp; for he
had made this agreement with guile and treachery and full deceit, as was
afterwards proved;&nbsp; for at that time Hacon and his band, who are rightly
called the treasury of hidden wickedness, together with his unworthy thralls,
had conspired together in the counsel of their badness for the death and murder
of the holy Magnus.&nbsp; For that all evil is mighty and right dear to
shameful company, they determine among themselves that this mischief shall now
no longer be put off, and that now they will thoroughly slake their cruel
thirst in the out-shedding of innocent blood.&nbsp; But the highest Lord of all
power took care for his dear friend and chosen martyr that, as at that time
ready for the kingdom of heaven, he should be taken out of this life under the
heavy flail of sharp death.&nbsp; As the grapes in the winepress by being
trodden on and crushed give off the purest wine in their season with great
fragrance and sweet savour;&nbsp; so gave this the glorious martyr of God by
reason of his death to all the friends of God and his own, the heavenly sweetness
of godly mercy, from that glory and bliss which he hath obtained in the endless
joy of everlasting life with God and his saints.</p>

<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the holy time of Easter
day was over, then each side made them ready to this meeting in unlike
wise.&nbsp; The holy Magnus summoned to him all those men whom he knew had the
best good-will to do a good turn to those kinsmen.&nbsp; He had two longships
manned with the bravest men, just as many as were agreed on, and when he was
boun he held on for Egelsha.&nbsp; But as they were rowing in still water and
calm weather, then there rose a billow close to the ship in which the earl
Magnus was, and broke over the ship where the earl sat.&nbsp; The chief men on
board the ship of earl Magnus hight thus:&nbsp; Thorstein, of whom we spoke
before, Arnkell, Grim, and Gilli, and many other doughty men.&nbsp; They
wondered much at the hap that a billow fell on them in a calm where no man had
ever known a billow to fall before, and where the water under was deep.&nbsp;
Then saint Magnus said:&nbsp; "It is not strange though ye wonder at this,
but my thought is, that this hap is a foreboding of my life's end;&nbsp; may be
that may happen here which was before spaed, that earl Paul's son would work
the greatest wickedness;&nbsp; may be that Hacon is plotting treachery against
us at this meeting."&nbsp; The men of earl Magnus were much afraid at
these words, when he said he had so short hope as to his life's end, and bade
him to shelter himself and be wary of his life, and not go on trusting in earl
Hacon.&nbsp; Saint Magnus answers:&nbsp; "I will of a surety fare to this
meeting as hath been agreed on, and bring no reproach that I have broken my
word on me for the sake of my foreboding alone.&nbsp; And may all be done after
God's will as to our voyage.&nbsp; But if I may have any choice, then I would
much rather thole wrong than do wrong to another man.&nbsp; So may God let my
kinsman Hacon get forgiveness though he may do wrong to me."</p>

<p>Now we must tell of earl Hacon that he summoned to him a great band of
warriors.&nbsp; He had seven or eight warships all large, filled with
men;&nbsp; all that company were well boun as though they were running out to
battle.&nbsp; But when the force came together, the earl made it clear to his
men that that meeting should so settle matters between earl Magnus and him that
they should not thenceforth both of them be over the realm.&nbsp; Many of the
earl's men, who might soothly be called the sons of the Devil, showed
themselves well pleased at this purpose, and added to it many fearful
words;&nbsp; but they, Sigurd and Sighvat sock, were then still among the worst
in utterance, who aye and aye were egging on to ill.&nbsp; Then men fell to
rowing hard, and they fared hotly and furiously.&nbsp; Havard Gunni's son, of
whom we spoke before, ws then with earl Hacon, he was a dear friend of both
earls, Hacon had hidden this bad counsel from Havard.&nbsp; But as soon as ever
he was aware of it, then he leaped overboard from the earl's ship and swam to
an isle where no man dwelt, for he would not be a partner in any treachery with
Hacon against the holy Magnus.&nbsp; That man was with earl Magnus who hight
Holdbodi, a truth-telling householder out of the Southern isles, he was one of
the dearest of earl Magnus' followers;&nbsp; he was then hard by at all these
tidings, and has afterwards told most fully about all that befell and all the
discourse between earl Hacon and earl Magnus, as may now be heard next after
this.</p>

<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Magnus the saint came to
Egelsha with his men sooner than earl Hacon.&nbsp; And when they saw Hacon's
eight warships then earl Magnus thought he knew that foul play must be meant,
and all men who had any clear-sightedness, wondered how such a number of armed
men could be wanted for any peaceful purpose.&nbsp; Would be revealed, then he
went up on the isle to the church to prayer;&nbsp; and was there the night, not
for dread or fear's sake, but rather to commit to God all his case.&nbsp; The
men of earl Magnus offered to defend him and to fight against earl Hacon, but
he answered so:&nbsp; "I will not lay your life in peril for me, and if
peace cannot be set between us two kinsmen, then God's will be done;&nbsp; for
I will rather thole hurt and treachery than use them against
others."&nbsp; For this noble martyr, saying these things, well knew that
all guile and deceit recoil on him who does them.&nbsp; Now his men thought
that came sooth which he had before said about the treachery of Hacon.&nbsp;
But for that earl Magnus knew beforehand as to the duration of his life,
whether it were of his own wit or of godly foreshowing, so he would not fly or
fare far from the meeting of his foes, and he sought not the holy church for
other sake than that of faith.&nbsp; Earl Magnus was awake long in prayer
through the night, and took heed for his soul's help and prayed for it
carefully;&nbsp; he confided all his business and his own self into God's
hand.&nbsp; Next morning he made them sing him mass, and in that mass he
received the Lord's Body.&nbsp; And this his deed was needed for the highest
proof, that on that spot he should become the sacrifice of God, as the helpful
sacrifice of Our Lord Jesus Christ's body and blood was offered up for the good
of the whole world.&nbsp; But earl Hacon, who at that time was banished from
all fear and love of God, dishonouring the privileges of the Church, was not
afraid to go into the holy church violating thus her peace and freedom, so that
he showed his wickedness all the more grimly that he did it in a holier
place.&nbsp; For ever is sin increased by ill deeds and evil by badness;&nbsp;
and the sinner, when he comes into the deep of sins, throws off all fear of
God, and the more he is wont to sin, the more bold he gets, and the less he
cares what ill he doeth, for then he thinks it little worth however great his
misdeeds may be.&nbsp; That same morning that earl Hacon had come up on the
isle with his evildoers, he sent four of his men, the worst of his servants,
who were most cruel and readiest to evil deeds, to seize earl Magnus wherever
he might be.&nbsp; These four, who may rather be called for their cruelty the
most harmful wolves than reasonable men, ever thirsting for the outshedding of
blood, rushed into the church just about the end of the mass.&nbsp; They
snatched at once earl Magnus the saint with great violence, noise, and tumult
out of the peace and bosom of holy church, as the gentlest sheep out of the
sheep-fold.&nbsp; The holy one was holden of sinful thralls, the righteous one
was bound and dragged wrongfully by wrong-doers, and led in that way before the
covetous judge earl Hacon.&nbsp; But this the strong champion of God showed so
much steadfastness in all these sufferings, that his body neither quaked for
fear, nor his heart for dread or grief, for he left this thorny world with all
its fruitless flowers.&nbsp; He looked that God would recompence to him his
long-suffering with an unspeakable crown;&nbsp; but their cruelty and fury with
endless pangs in the hot fire of hell, for such unmanly evil and monstrous
covetousness.&nbsp; He was as glad and merry when they laid hands on him as if
he were bidden to a banquet, and with such steadfast heart and soul that he
neither spoke to his adversaries with any bitterness, wrath, or broken voice.</p>

<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When earl Magnus the saint was come
before earl Hacon, he spoke with much steadfastness to Hacon.&nbsp; "Thou
dost not well, kinsman," says he, "that thou holdest not thy oaths,
and it is much to be looked for that thou hast done this more by the ill will
of others and their egging on, than of thy own badness.&nbsp; Now I will offer
thee three choices, that thou may'st take one of them rather than that thou
shouldst spoil thy oaths, and let me be slain thy kinsman, and guiltless as
some will say."&nbsp; Earl Hacon said, "I will first hear then what
thou offerest."&nbsp; Saint Magnus says, "This is the first choice,
that I shall fare away out of the land to Rome, or right out to Jerusalem, to
seek holy places, and so make amends for both of us twain;&nbsp; I shall have
two ships out of the land manned with good men, and those necessaries which we
need to have.&nbsp; I shall swear never to come to the Orkneys
afterwards."&nbsp; That choice was quickly refused by Hacon and his
men.&nbsp; Then said saint Magnus:&nbsp; "Now for that our life is in your
power, but I know that I have been guilty in many things against all-ruling
God, and that I therefore need to make amends:&nbsp; then send me up into
Scotland to the friends of both of us, and let me be kept in ward there with
two men for a passtime to me;&nbsp; and see thou so to it that I may never come
out of that wardship without thy leave."&nbsp; To this they said
"Nay" quickly, and found many reasons why it might not be.&nbsp; Then
this steadfast knight said, "I am in a great strait about the
choice," says he.&nbsp; "Now is that one alone left, which I will
offer thee;&nbsp; and God knows that about this I look rather to the salvation
of thy soul than to the life of my body;&nbsp; for after all it beseems thee
less to quench my life.&nbsp; Let me be maimed in my limbs, or let my eyes be
plucked out, and so set me in a dark dungeon from which I may never come
out."&nbsp; Then said earl Hacon, "This atonement I take, nor do I
ask for aught more."&nbsp; Then earl Hacon's men jumped up and said To
this we will not agree, to torture earl Magnus;&nbsp; but we will slay either
one of you twain;&nbsp; and ye two shall not from this day forth both rule the
lands."&nbsp; Then says earl Hacon, "I will rather rule the lands
than die quickly, if ye are so stern in this matter." --- So said Holdbodi
of their parley.&nbsp; After that saint Magnus fell to prayers, and looked into
the palms of his hands, and poured out many tears in God's eyesight, giving his
cause, his life, and himself into the Lord's power.</p>

<p>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to this, when the holy
friend of God, earl Magnus, was done and doomed to death, then earl Hacon bade
Ofeig his banner-bearer to slay earl Magnus;&nbsp; but he said "Nay"
with the greatest wrath.&nbsp; Then earl Hacon forced his cook, whose name was
Lifolf, to kill earl Magnus, but he began to weep with a loud voice.&nbsp; Then
earl Magnus the saint spoke and said to him, "Thou shalt not
weep,"&nbsp; says he, "for there is fame for thee in doing such
deeds.&nbsp; Be thou of steadfast heart, for thou shalt have my clothes, as is
the wont and law of the men of old.&nbsp; Thou shalt not be afraid, for thou
doest this by force, and he that forces thee to do it hath greater sin than
thou."&nbsp; But when he had said this, then he stripped off him his
kirtle, and gave it to Lifolf.&nbsp; After that the blessed earl Magnus asked
leave to say his prayers, and it was granted him.&nbsp; Then he fell flat on
the earth and gave himself over into God's power, bringing himself to Him as an
offering.&nbsp; Nor did he pray for himself alone, but rather for his foes and
banemen as well, and he forgave them from all his heart what they had misdone
towards him;&nbsp; and he confessed to God all his offences, and prayed that
they might all be washed off him by the outshedding of his blood;&nbsp; and he
commended his soul into God's hand, praying God's angels to come to meet it,
and bear it into the rest of Paradise.&nbsp; Then, when this famous martyr of
God had ended his prayers, he said to Lifolf, "Stand thou before me, and
hew me on the head a great wound, for it beseems not to behead chiefs like
thieves.&nbsp; Strengthen thee, man, and weep not, for I have prayed God that
he will pardon thee."&nbsp; After that earl Magnus signed himself with the
cross, and bowed him to the stroke.&nbsp; But Lifolf hewed him on the head a
great blow with an axe.&nbsp; Then earl Hacon said, "Hew thou a second
time."&nbsp; Then Lifolf hewed into the same wound.&nbsp; Then saint
Magnus the earl fell on his knees, and fared with this martyrdom from the
wretchedness of this world to the everlasting bliss of the kingdom of
heaven.&nbsp; And this man whom the man-slayer took out of the world,
All-ruling God let rule with him in heaven.&nbsp; His body fell to earth, but
his soul was loftily lifted up to the heavenly glory of the angels.&nbsp; That
spot on which saint Magnus was smitten with stony and mossy;&nbsp; but a little
after his worthiness towards God was revealed, so that since there is there a
green field, fair and smooth;&nbsp; and God showed by this token that earl
Magnus was slain for righteousness sake, and that he had gotten the fairness
and greenness of Paradise on the land of the living.&nbsp; The death-day of
earl Magnus the saint is two nights after the feast of Tiburtius and
Valerianus;&nbsp; it was on the second day of the week that the worthy earl
Magnus was slain, three weeks after Lady Day [Lady Day, 25th of March, and St.
Magnus' Day, April 16th.] in Lent.&nbsp; He had then been twelve winters earl
with Hacon.&nbsp; Then were kings in Norway Sigurd Jewry-farer, and his
brothers Eystein and Olaf.&nbsp; Then had passed since the fall of saint Olaf
Harold's son seventy-four [The figures are wrong both in the Orkneyingers Saga
and here.&nbsp; They should be eighty-six.] winters.&nbsp; That was in the days
of Pope Pascal the second of that name, and of St. John bishop of Holar in
Iceland."&nbsp; To the honour of earl Magnus the saint, Master Robert who
has written the story in Latin so speaks:</p>

<p>28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This day is revealed to us,
dearest brethren, the death day of the blessed earl Magnus the Martyr, his day
of rest and everlasting bliss.&nbsp; Let us be glad and joyful on this high
day, for that he craves solemn good-will and special honour of us, who dwell by
his halidom [From this it appears that Master Robert, who preached the sermon
on the day of the Saint's martyrdom, was an Orkneyinger.] and under his
patronage and safe-keeping;&nbsp; and let us look towards his worthiness.&nbsp;
For that because of his sublime example and holy life, first bloomed in the
reagion of the realm of the Orkneys the fairest dispensations of pure good
will, and from the holiest decrees of this gloryful martyr sprung manifold
increase of the most seemly virtue.&nbsp; He drove away the throne of the
lordship of the Devil out of the northern airt of the world, and established in
its stead the tabernacle of Almighty God.&nbsp; He withered and uprooted all
ill weeds with his preaching, but let grow up the fairest flowers and the
sweetest corn crop of the most helpsome growth. &nbsp;He turned all the
bitterness of the Orkneys into the seemliness and sweetness of holy
habits.&nbsp; Today he conquered the world and the world's lords, and he
ascended a noble victor over the world, taking from his holy master, our Lord Jesus
Christ, a crown of glory.&nbsp; Today he was parted from all the weight of
bodily weakness, faring through the heavens, and he entered into bliss, having
become like to holy men in all glory.&nbsp; Today he threw off the worldly garb
of this changeful life, uprising higher than human weakness may reckon;&nbsp;
and to him for that is granted heavenly worship, honour and bliss before the
eyes of all the Saints.&nbsp; He ascended in truth bright in worthiness, mighty
in perfect blessedness, gloriful from the most seemly victory.&nbsp; This the
exalted martyr of God, the blessed earl Magnus, adorned with the crown of his
own blood, was tortured when there had passed from the incarnation of Our Lord
Jesus Christ one thousand one hundred and four years, [It should be sixteen.]
on a Monday, the sixteenth of the kalends of the month of May.&nbsp; Now, my
dearest, let us cast away bodily lusts, and keep us from the love of unlawful
things, conquering and rising above the attacks of blasphemy;&nbsp; but let us
follow the footsteps and life of this the glorious martyr with all the strength
of our minds, so far as our feebleness may bring us.&nbsp; Let us follow the
ways of his life;&nbsp; let us hold to the pattern of his works, let us strive
to be like his life, though it be every day revealed and made plain --- by
wondrous miracles and great and glorious tokens, which Almighty God grants to
the Northern region for his noble intercession and famous worthiness, both on
sea and land, --- that his life and holy virtue is rather more praiseworthy and
wonderful than possible to be imitated by our weakness.&nbsp; He appeared on
earth that he might became our guardian and intercessor for help and mercy with
Almighty God.&nbsp; For this it beseems us who are weighed down with the great
load of our sins ever to pay him worship with the special devotion of bounden
obedience and honour, that this the exalted martyr earl Magnus may deign to
beseech for us with his worthiness and prayers that we may attain to be
partakers of the heavenly crown and everlasting glory, which he obtained on the
day of his martyrdom.&nbsp; May Our Lord Jesus Christ grant us this, who is
honour and bliss, help and health, gladness and glory of all his saints and
righteous men;&nbsp; who with the Father and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth
one God in three persons world without end.&nbsp; Amen."&nbsp; Master
Robert wrote this story in Latin to the worship and honour of saint Magnus the
isle-earl, when twenty winters [It is impossible to verify this date, but if it
be correct Master Robert must have written his life of St. Magnus in the year
1136.] were passed from his martyrdom.</p>

<p>29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we must take up the story and
tell of those things which were done after the death of saint Magnus the earl,
that so great was the cruelty and hardness of earl Hacon, and so great his wrath
and fury against the blessed Magnus, that he no less envied earl Magnus dead
than alive.&nbsp; And though the fury and grimness of most men can be soothed
after an ill deed is done, still neither ill will nor envy was soothed or sated
in the heart of Hacon, for he forbids that earl Magnus should be buried at the
church like Christian men, but rather that he should be there hidden in the
ground where he was slain.</p>

<p>30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been settled at the former
meeting of the earls in Hrossey, that when their agreement had been fully
strengthened and made steadfast after the judgment of the best men, which they
had bound with oaths, that both earls, when they fared from the meeting, which
had been fixed in Egelsha, should go to a feast in Paplay, to Thora the mother
of earl Magnus.&nbsp; But now after the slaying and death of the earl, then
earl Hacon still went to the feast with his men.&nbsp; There was the best of
banquets.&nbsp; But when drink took hold on earl Hacon, then Thora went to him
and said thus: --- "Now art thou alone come here, lord, but I looked for
both of you twain, thee and earl Magnus my son.&nbsp; Now be so with me in my
prayer, as thou wilt that all ruling God shall be to thee at doomsday, that
thou givest me leave that my son may be buried at church."&nbsp; Earl
Hacon looked towards her and shed tears, and said, "Bury thy son, woman,
there where it liketh thee."&nbsp; Saint Magnus was then brought to church
and buried at Birsay in Christchurch, which earl Thorfinn his grandfather had
let be built.&nbsp; Then eftsoons a heavenly light was seen to shine over his
grave.&nbsp; Afterwards men who were placed in peril began to vow to saint
Magnus the earl, and their need was granted as they themselves prayed for
it.&nbsp; At the same time a heavenly fragrance was perceived at his grave, and
there sick men got their health.&nbsp; Next to that men made their voyage from
the Orkneys and Shetland who were past hope of cure, and watched over his tomb,
and all got healing for their hurts;&nbsp; but still men dared not to spread
the miracles of earl Magnus much abroad while earl Hacon lived.&nbsp; It is is
so said of those men who had been worst in going between the earls, and were
most in treachery against earl Magnus, that they most of them had quick ends
and a short life, and they died an ill death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the slaying of of saint Magnus, Hacon Paul's son took under him all the
rule in the Orkneys;&nbsp; he made then all men to take oaths of fealty to him,
even those as well who had before served earl Magnus.&nbsp; Then he became a
great chief, and laid heavy burdens on the friends of earl Magnus, whom he
thought had been most against him in their dealings.&nbsp; Some winters after
Hacon made him ready for a voyage out of the land;&nbsp; he fared south to
Rome, and in that voyage he fared right out to Jewry, as was then palmers' wont;&nbsp;
there he sought holy places, and bathed him in the river Jordan.&nbsp; After
that he fared back to his own land, and took under him the rule in the
Orkneys.&nbsp; He became then a good governor, and kept his realm well at
peace.&nbsp; He laid down then new laws, which the freemen liked far better
than those which had been before.&nbsp; By such things his friendships began to
wax many.&nbsp; Then it came about that those Orkneyingers desired nothing else
than to keep earl Hacon in power in the Orkneys, and his offspring.&nbsp; And
there we make an end of speaking of Hacon in this book.</p>

<p>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most merciful God, our
Lord Jesus Christ, who bids and leads his friends to everlasting bliss from all
the misery of this world, he the same who looses all those who creep with all
their heart to his mercy, from all the sins and defilement of this sorrowful
world, and makes out of the ignorant the wisest, of low and humble the most
famous, of poor the richest, of ignoble the most noble chiefs, not indeed of
this world's kingdom, but rather of the kingdom of heaven, and of endless
glory, as he did of old by Joseph the patriarch, who was led out of the dark
dungeon, and made at once lord and chief of all the realm of Egypt --- he, the
same who made David out of a shepherd's lad the highest king over all the
tribes of Israel, and led Judas Maccabeus out of the starvation of the
wilderness, that he might attain honour and renown in victory, and such great
glory that he was thought by far to excel other men;&nbsp; and Alexander the
son of Philip, who was called the Macedonian, for the sake of the hard
mastership of Aristotle [Here at least one leaf in the MS. is lost.]&nbsp;
**************** and furnished in all things, as might be most seemly.&nbsp;
Then the lord bishop enshrined the halidom of the blessed earl Magnus with
honour and pomp, and the thanksgiving of the whole people;&nbsp; and then all
those were healed who were in despair of health, and needing mercy, who had
come thither at that time to his halidom.&nbsp; Saint Magnus the earl was
enshrined on the Feast of Lucy the Virgin, before Yule in the winter.&nbsp; And
that day is worthily kept far and wide, both to saint Magnus and the blessed
maid of God Lucy;&nbsp; but the day of his departure to the kingdom of heaven
is in spring.</p>

<p>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we have gone over, though it be
less worthily than should be, the story of the translation, proving, and
enshrining of the halidom of the blessed earl Magnus, and no less the law which
was passed as to his feast.&nbsp; And it is to be borne in mind and marked that
the Lord God honours his bosom friends with divers privileges for their
righteousness, some here at once in this life, but others after life.&nbsp; But
still those prerogatives among saints seem somewhat special and preeminent
which belong to Magnus the martyr of God.&nbsp; This is to be understood thus,
that when one of his bones was proved at home in the Orkneys, it turned into
the fairest mark of the cross in the eyesight of men who stood by.&nbsp;
Another mark is this, that this very same cross of bone was turned afterwards
to the brightest hue of gold before the lord Pope himself in Rome.&nbsp;
Wherefore he takes this the purple martyr into the catalogue of saints;&nbsp;
but that has been granted to few others in the North lands, that he (the Pope)
himself has done this.&nbsp; For this we may behold and wonder, though no man
may understand it as it is, how mighty the all ruling God is in the riches and
depth of his mercy;&nbsp; for he grants these gifts of love to some of his
friends which he doth not grant to others, and shares them between them in the
way that he will;&nbsp; and never faileth, though he give the gifts of the Holy
Spirit to each of them.&nbsp; Therefore be his name eternally praised and
blessed for ever and ever, Amen.</p>

<p>33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that time the working of
miracles of saint Magnus the earl was noised and spread far and near over all
the western lands, and the north region of the world;&nbsp; and men fared from
nearlying lands, burgs, and towns, castles and hundreds, with great hearts and
offering hands to seek his halidom;&nbsp; but some sent money towards his holy
shrine as an honour to him, but as a means of healing soul and body for
themselves, both in this world and the other.&nbsp; For that shall here next be
told some miracles, though they be few, of the countless ones which God grants
for his worthiness.</p>

<p>34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When goodman Bergfinn from the north
of Shetland, who was before named in this matter, [i.e., in the lost leaves.]
heard these joyful tidings of the translation of saint Magnus the earl, then he
fared a second time from the north of Shetland with his leprous son, whose name
was Halfdan, to Kirkwall, and they both watched, that father and son, at the
halidom of earl Magnus.&nbsp; But the saint of God appeared to Halfdan, and
passed his hands over his body, and on the spot all leprosy fell off him.&nbsp;
Then he arose as whole.&nbsp; Saint Magnus the earl also showed himself to
goodman Bergfinn in sleep, and said to him, "Now shalt thou take clear
sight, for now hast thou fared hither with right faith, and not doubted my
holiness, and offered me fair vows, both in prayers and fee-gifts."&nbsp;
Then he made the mark of the cross over Bergfinn's eyes, and he awoke as
sharpsighted as when he had been sharpest-sighted, and both father and son
fared home whole, praising God and saint Magnus the earl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorkell
hight a man who abode in the Orkneys, he fell off his barley-rick and was all
lamed on his other side on which he fell on the earth.&nbsp; He was borne to
the saint earl Magnus, and there he got speedy cure of his hurts, in healed
broken bones, and strengthened body.&nbsp; He thanked God and saint Magnus for
his healing
gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Amundi Illugi's son hight a man, a goodman north from Shetland, he was leprous
and very sick.&nbsp; He fared to earl Magnus the saint, and watched at his
shrine, and begged him for mercy and cure.&nbsp; But as he slept then Magnus
the isle-earl appeared to him, and passed his hands over his body, and gave him
healing so speedily that he woke up quite whole;&nbsp; and he gave thanks to
God for his cure, and to the merciful
Magnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sigurd Tandri's son hight a man, he abode in Shetland at that farm which is
hight the Dale;&nbsp; he became mad, so that he was sewn up in hide.&nbsp; This
man was brought to saint Magnus the earl, and there he got his wit and full
health, and he fared thence quite whole, praising God and the saint earl
Magnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another
man hight Sigurd, from the north of Shetland;&nbsp; he had cramped hands, so
that all the fingers lay in the palms.&nbsp; He sought the halidom of the saint
earl Magnus, and there he got his cure with straight and lissom fingers for all
his needs.&nbsp; He thanked God for the mercies which had been shown him for
the worthiness of earl
Magnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a man hight Thorbjorn Olaf's son, from the north of Shetland, he was
devil-mad and witless.&nbsp; He was brought to the shrine of St. Magnus the
earl, and he became at once whole, and he fared to his own home, praising and
blessing God, and this his blissful martyr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thord hight a man who was also called "dragonbeak," hireling of the
aforesaid goodman Bergfinn.&nbsp; He thrashed corn in the barley barn the next
day before the mass-day of saint Magnus the earl.&nbsp; But when it was about
nones in the day, then Bergfinn bade him to leave off working.&nbsp; "Tis
not very often," said Thord, "that thou thinkest overmuch work is
done."&nbsp; Bergfinn said, "The highday that cometh tomorrow we are
bound to keep with all the reverence that we may and can."&nbsp; Then
Bergfinn went away, but Thord worked on as before.&nbsp; But when a short time
was over, then Bergfinn went out the second time, and said to Thord in great
wrath,&nbsp; "It mislikes me very much that thou workest in holy
times;&nbsp; but leave off at once on the spot."&nbsp; Then the goodman
went away very wrath, but Thord worked on as before.&nbsp; But when men were
about full at supper, then in came Thord in workaday clothes, and fell at once
to drinking greedily.&nbsp; And when he had drunk one horn of liquor, then he
became mad, so that men had once to throw him into bonds, and he went on so for
six days.&nbsp; Then goodman Bergfinn vowed for him to give a half a mark of
silver towards the shrine of saint Magnus the earl, and to let Thord watch
there three nights if he became whole.&nbsp; But Thord got back his health the
next night after the vow was made for him;&nbsp; and all praised the highest
King of heaven, and this his worthy bosom friend saint Magnus the
earl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is said again that two men broke gold from off the shrine of saint Magnus
the earl, one of them was a Caithness man, and the other an Orkneyan.&nbsp; But
that Caithness man was lost and drowned in the Pentland Firth, and his name was
Gilli.&nbsp; But the Orkneyan became mad, and he said in his ravings what they
had done.&nbsp; Then a pilgrimage to Rome was vowed for him if he got
whole.&nbsp; After that he was brought to earl Magnus the saint, and a vow was
made for his cure, and he became whole on the spot, and praised God and saint
Magnus the
earl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Asmund hight a man.&nbsp; On his head fell a great log, and crushed his
skull, but the oftnamed goodman Bergfinn vowed for him;&nbsp; and lots were
cast whether it should be vowed for him to go on a pilgrimage to Rome, or to
give money to the church of Magnus.&nbsp; But the lot came up that he should
seek the halidom of earl Magnus the saint.&nbsp; Then he got back at once his
speech which he had before lost.&nbsp; After that he fared to saint Magnus the
earl, and watched there and got the full cure of his hurts.&nbsp; But goodman
Bergfinn gave earl Magnus half a mark of silver weighed as he had
vowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>There was a woman hight Sigrid;&nbsp; she was daughter of Sigurd of Sand,
from the north of Shetland.&nbsp; She was blind from blate babyhood [i.e., from
"tender years."] till she was quite twenty.&nbsp; Her father carried
her south to the Orkneys, and let her watch at the shrine of saint Magnus the
earl.&nbsp; e offered there much money.&nbsp; Sigrid got there clear sight in
both her eyes, and that father and daughter fared thence, blessing and praising
God and earl Magnus the saint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;There was yet another woman hight Sigrid, daughter of Arnfrid, from
the north of Shetland, from that farm which is called Unst.&nbsp; Her leg broke
into two bits, and she was carried to saint Magnus the earl, and she got speedy
cure, and thanked God and earl Magnus the
saint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Yet a third woman hight Sigrid, from the north of Shetland out of
Unst.&nbsp; She was at board with that householder whose name was
Thorlak;&nbsp; he abode at Bollastede.&nbsp; Sigrid was sewing about evening
before the feast of saint Magnus the earl, after that other men had kept it
holy.&nbsp; Thorlak asked why she worked so long, but she said she was just
going to stop.&nbsp; The goodman went away then, but she sewed as before.&nbsp;
Then came Thorlak the second time to her, and said, "Why dost thou so ill
at such a holy time?&nbsp; Go away now, and work no longer in my
house."&nbsp; She said it was a very little fault, and sewed on as before
till it was dark night.&nbsp; But when men busked them to meat, then Sigrid
fell mad, so that she had to be thrown at once into bonds, and was hardly held
until Thorlak vowed for her, and cast lots whether she should go to Rome or
give goods to saint Magnus the earl.&nbsp; And that lot came up that she was to
go to Kirkwall to the halidom of earl Magnus the saint.&nbsp; And afterwards
she was borne thither, and got there the sublime gift of healing for her loss
of wit, and she praised God and his exalted knight earl Magnus;&nbsp; but still
she fared afterwards to Rome for her (soul's)
help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Groa hight a woman out of Hrossey;&nbsp; she was devil mad, and fared
to Kirkwall to saint Magnus the earl, and there she got good health, and
praised God and the earl saint
Magnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ragnhild hight a woman;&nbsp; she was a cripple when she was four winters
old, and all up to the time she was twenty.&nbsp; Then she watched three nights
at the halidom of St. Magnus the earl.&nbsp; And on the third night there
appeared to her in her sleep a bright man and a noble and fairly clad, and said
to her, "Ever and oft hast thou lain here, great is thy need;&nbsp; rise
thou up now, and be whole, and bear this staff in thy hand."&nbsp; After
that he vanished from her.&nbsp; But she woke;&nbsp; then she had hold on the
lock that was on the aumbry which was on the other side of the choir of Magnus'
(church).&nbsp; (She) rose up at once quite whole, as though she had never been
bent, with straight legs and sinews, praising God and saint Magnus the
earl.&nbsp; She was with the bishop many
winters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Asa hight a woman;&nbsp; she had been all her days a cripple, but she got
such a sublime cure of her health from the blessed earl Magnus, that she walked
to Rome the same summer that she became whole.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gudrun hight a woman;&nbsp; she was a cripple a long time of her life.&nbsp;
She got quick healing of her hurt and full cure from the worthiness and
intercession of earl Magnus the saint, and praised God and his bosom friend
earl
Magnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sigurd hight a man;&nbsp; he was an almsman from Knotsand.&nbsp; He was so
very weakly that he crawled on his knees, and could not stand upright.&nbsp; He
became quite whole at the shrine of earl Magnus;&nbsp; he praised God and saint
Magnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Two men from the Southern isles cast dice for silver, and one of them lost a
hundred marks;&nbsp; then all his goods were at an end, save one barge that he
had left.&nbsp; Then he laid the barge against all the goods which he had
lost.&nbsp; Then he threw that had won before two sixes.&nbsp; The then the
other vowed a vow to earl Magnus the saint for help that he might get back his
goods.&nbsp; After that he cast, and there turned up six on one of the dice,
but the other split asunder into two bits, and there were seven spots on both
the bits together and thirteen on the three, and so he won all his
goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>That event happened in Norway in the days of Harold Gilli, that some
powerful and high and mighty men laid it against two brothers that they meant
to beguile their kinswomen.&nbsp; But this charge was not sooth.&nbsp; But for
all that those powerful men fell on them and laid hands on them, carrying them
to the wood away from other men, and slew him against whom they gave it out
that he was most guilty.&nbsp; After that they took the other, and dealt him
many and great tortures with great cruelty, so far that they broke asunder both
his legs and his arms too.&nbsp; After that those cruel men stabbed out both
his eyes, therewith cutting the tongue away out of his head, and parting from
him in such unmanly wise that they fared away, but he lay there half
dead.&nbsp; Speedily after they were away, many wolves rushed out of the wood,
rending and tearing the flesh off the bones of him that lay slain, and after
that fairing back into the wood.&nbsp; But of the wounded one it is to be said
that albeit he could not with his tongue pray for mercy, he still bethought him
all at once that Almighty God might grant him some help.&nbsp; Especially he
turned his thoughts thither where the earl saint Magnus was, for in that time
his miracle-making flourished most of all.&nbsp; And when he had vowed his vow
he became aware that a man has come to him, who passes his hands over his
broken legs and arms.&nbsp; Therewith he takes the stump of the tongue and
brings it to its place at last;&nbsp; afterwards he lays his hands on the
eye-sockets.&nbsp; But with this handling wondrous changes came about;&nbsp;
the eyes were reset with clear sight, the tongue is become useful for all
utterance, the broken limbs were healed, and all his former health restored to
him.&nbsp; He sees standing by him a man fair of face, to whom he thus speaks:
--- "What is thy name most noble lord?"&nbsp; The bright man answers,
"Here is earl Magnus, but mind well to keep what thou hast vowed to
God."&nbsp; At this he was full of joy, and so speaks the second time: ---
"For that, sublime friend of God, that thou hast granted me a great gift
of healing.&nbsp; I pray again of thy mercy that thou beggest life for my
brother from God."&nbsp; After he had so spoken the saint earl Magnus
vanished from his sight, answering nothing to the prayer mentioned.&nbsp; But
that man falls forward, and thanks God for the mercy shown him, meaning to
abide there in that spot two nights in steadfast prayer to help his brother.&nbsp;
But as time went by he looks around, and sees a flock of many wolves running
out of the wood to where the carcase of the departed one lay, and there they
spew up all that they had eaten of his flesh and bones, and turn back after
that into the wood.&nbsp; And when a little time is passed he sees saint Magnus
come, and he blesses with his right hand the whole mass together, the wolves'
spew and the bones.&nbsp; Next to this the body becomes quite whole by these
means.&nbsp; Saint Magnus blesses the breathless body a second time, for the
sake of which he that before was slain rose up whole and living, and goes to
his brother.&nbsp; Then each of them greeted the other, giving thanks to God
and to saint Magnus the earl for such ready mercy as was shown them.&nbsp; So
let also all hearing such great works yield manifold praise to the true God who
grants such great things to sinful men for the prayers and worthiness of his
most beloved bosom friends.</p>
