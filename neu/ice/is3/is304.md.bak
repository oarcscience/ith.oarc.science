THE STORY OF EARL ROGNVALD

 

61.        Cecilia (1) was the name of a sister of earl Magnus, born in
wedlock.  She was given away east in Norway, and that man whose name was
Isaac had her to wife.  Their son’s name was Kol.  Kol (Kali’s son) sate
on his farms in Agdir, as was written before, and was the wisest of all
men.  He did not fare into the Orkneys.  Kol was a very shrewd man. 
Kali his son grew up there, and was the most hopeful (2) man, a
middleman in growth, well set up, one of the best limbed of men, with
light brown hair.  He had more friends than most men, and was a more
proper man, both in body and mind, than most of the other men of his
time.  He made this song:

                        “Draughts I play with open hand,

                        Games and feats so skilful nine;

                        Writing runes to me comes ready;

                        Books I read and smith’s work furnish;

                        I can glide on snow-shoon swift;

                        Doughtily I shoot and row;

                        Either stands at my behest,

                        Sweep of harp or burst of song.”

         Kali was almost always with Solmund his kinsman, the son of
Sigurd supple.  He was (the king’s) steward at Tunsberg, and had a house
of his own at East Agdir.  He was a chief, and had a great following. 
They were much of an age, those kinsmen.

62.       Kali was fifteen winters old when he fared with chapmen west
to England, and had good wares for traffic.  They held on their course
to that town which is called Grimsby.  Thither came a very great crowd
of men both from Norway, the Orkneys, and from Scotland, and so also
from the Southern isles.  There Kali met that man who went by the name
of Gillikrist. (3)  He asked then much about Norway, and talked most
with Kali;  there was a great fellowship sprung up (between them).  He
told Kali as a secret that his name was Harold, and that king Magnus
barelegs was his father, but that his mother’s stock was in the Southern
isles, and some of them in Ireland.  He asked Kali how he thought he
would be welcomed if he came to Norway.  Kali says he thought king
Sigurd likely to give him a good welcome if other men did not spoil
matters between them.  They, Gillikrist and Kali, exchanged gifts at
their parting;  each promised the other his thorough friendship wherever
their next meeting might be.  But Gillikrist does not tell his secret to
more men in that place.

63.       After that Kali fared from the west on board the same ship,
and they came from abroad at Agdir, and held on thence north to Bergen. 
Then Kali sang this song:

Weeks of grimmest walking five

We have waded through the mud;

In mid Grimsby where we were,

Was no want of mud and mire.

Now it is with merry minds,

O’er the sea-moors (4) that we let,

Beaked elk (5) across the billow,

Blithely bound to Bergen home.”

         But when they came to the town, they found there a great crowd
of men out the land, both from the north and from the south, and many,
too, from other lands, who had flitted thither much goods.  Then those
shipmates went into the taverns to make merry.  Kali was then a great
man for dress, and had many braveries with him as he was newly come from
England.  Then he thought much of himself, and many others thought so
too, for he came of a good stock, and was a well-bred man in himself. 
But in that tavern where he drank he found a young man of rank whose
name was John;  he was the son of Peter Sark’s son of Sogn.  He was then
one of the king’s liegemen.  His mother’s name was Helga, a daughter of
Harek of Sæter.  John was a very showy man in his dress.  Unna was the
name of a worthy housewife who owned the house in which they drank. 
Then there arose a great fellowship between those two, John and Kali,
and they parted with love;  John fared then south (6) to Sogn, to his
abode, but Kali east to Agdir, to his father.  Kali was also often with
Solmund his kinsman.  So it went on for some half years, that Kali was
in the summers on trading voyages, but at home in the winters or with
his kinsman Solmund.

64.       So it fell out one summer, when Kali had fared north to
Drontheim, that he lay weather-bound under that island which is called
Doll. (7)  In the isle was a great cave, which is called Doll’s cave. 
In the cave was great hope of treasure.  The chapmen made ready, and
went into the cave, and had the hardest work to make their way there. 
They came where water stood across the cave, and none dared to fare
across the water save Kali and another man, whose name was Havard,
Solmund’s house-carle.  They swam across the water, and had a rope
between them.  Kali swam first, and had in his hand a blazing torch and
a tinder-box between his shoulders. (8)  So they swam over the water and
came to land.  That place was rough and rugged, and there was a great
stench, and they could scarce get the light struck.  Then Kali gave out
that they would go no farther, and said they should make a beacon there
as a memorial.  Then Kali sang a song:

“Here have I built in darksome cave

Of Doll a beacon high

To goblin grim of sternest mood,

So golden store I sought,

None knows what man of those who work

The water-skates (9) will wend his way,

His long and weary path, once more

Across this water wide.”

         After that they turned back and came safe and sound to their
men, then they fared out of the cave;  it is not told about their
journey that any tidings happened that summer.  They came back to
Bergen, and Kali turned into the same tavern to Unna the housewife. 
There too he found again John Peter’s son and his serving-man, whose
name was Brynjulf.  There were there besides many others of his men,
though they are not named.  It happened one evening that they John
Peter’s son and Kali, were gone to sleep, but many sat behind and
drank.  Then there was much talk, when men were well drunk;  and it came
about that they spoke of matching one man with another, and of who were
thought to be noblest of the king’s liegemen in Norway.  Brynjulf stood
up that John Peter’s son was the best bred and best born of the younger
men south of Stad; (10)  but Havard Kali’s companion spoke up for
Solmund, and said he was no worse bred than John, and declared that the
dwellers in the Bay would set much greater store by him than by John
Peter’s son.  Out of this a great strife arose, and when the ale spoke
in them, then no better heed was taken than this, that up jumped Havard
and got him a cudgel and gave Brynjulf there and then such a blow on the
head that he fell down at once senseless, and men ran to help him up; 
but Havard was packed off to see Kali, and Kali sent him south into
Alvidra to a priest whose name was Richard, “and bring him,” he says,
“my message that I beg him to take thee in till I go home east.”  Kali
got him a man to bear him company, and a boat, and they row away south
till they come to Græning Sound.  Then Havard said to his
fellow-traveller:  “Now we two are come beyond the bark of hounds, and
we will rest ourselves here,” and with that they lie down to sleep.  Now
we must take up our story and say that Brynjulf came to his wits, and he
was carried to see John, and he tells him all that had happened, and how
the man had been packed off there and then.  John guessed the truth as
to his doings, and made them take a rowing-cutter, and ten men got into
her;  Brynjulf was there to lead the men.  After that they row south,
and come south into Græning Sound, (11) when it was getting daylight. 
Then they saw that a boat lay before them on the beach, “and may be,”
says Brynjulf, “that these men will be able to tell us something of
Havard.”  So they went up on land and found them;  Havard and his mate
were then just awake.  Brynjulf fell on Havard at once with the sword,
and both those companions were slain at that meeting.  And now Brynjulf
and his men fared back to Bergen after these tidings, and tell them to
John;  and after that all the townsfolk knew them.  Kali took the
tidings of these slayings very ill;  and when men came between him and
John, John says that his wish is that Kali shall alone make his award as
to the wrong which he thinks he has suffered, but that should be saving
the king’s right and that of the next of kin to take the feud up.  And
Kali agreed to those terms, but still there was no love between him and
John.  Then Kali fared home east very soon after that;  and when he and
his father met, and Kali had told about those tidings and the close of
his quarrel, then Kol says:  “Methought thou wert showing thyself in a
strange light when thou tookest any atonement before thy kinsman Solmund
were by;  now methinks thou has come into a strait, and canst take
little part in the matter, except to ask for atonement;  and so would
not Solmund do if thy house-carle were slain and his shipmate.”  Kali
says:  “Thou speakest the truth, no doubt, father, when thou sayest that
I have been too hasty in looking at the matter;  but thou wert too far
off to teach me what to do.  It will often be shown too that I am not so
deep-witted as thou, but still I thought this, that Solmund would be
never the nearer his due though I forsook that which was offered to me; 
and I do not call it a disgrace either to Solmund or to thee to accept
the right to fix your own terms from John for your share in the suit, if
he offers it you, though I very much doubt whether there is any need for
you to take up the matter.  But as for myself, I call myself quite free
as to Brynjulf, so long as I have come to no final utterance in the
matter, and taken no money in atonement.”  So that father and son talked
much together, and each of them drew his own way about it; (12)  then
they sent men to tell Solmund those tidings.  After that Kol and Kali
and Solmund met;  Kol wished that men should be sent to John to seek for
an atonement;  but Solmund and Hallvard, Havard’s brother, would hear of
nothing but revenge, man for man;  and said it was unseemly to ask a
Sogn man for atonement.  But for all that the plan was taken which Kol
wished, with this understanding, that Kol gave his word not to withdraw
from this suit before Solmund got what was due to his honour.  Kol too
was to have the whole management of the matter in his hands.  But when
the messengers came back, they say that their business was taken up
slowly and unwillingly;  and John refused right out to atone for that
man with money who had before made himself an outlaw by his deeds. 
Solmund said that had gone just after his guess, that it would bring
them little honour to ask John for an atonement;  and now he begged Kol
to give them some advice that was worth having.  Kol says:  “Will
Hallvard run any risk to get revenge for “his brother, and may be that
after all there may be little brought about.”  Hallvard said he would
not spare himself to get revenge for his brother, even though there were
risk of life in it.  Kol says:  “Then shalt thou fare north stealthily
to Sogn to that man whose name is Uni;  he dwells hard by John:  he is a
wise man and rather short of money, for John has long elbowed him out of
his means.  He is a great friend (of mine), and now rather stricken in
years.  To him thou shalt bring six marks weighed, which I send him that
he may lay some plan how thou mayest wreak thy revenge on Brynjulf, or
some other man of John’s household, whom he will think not less loss
(than Brynjulf.)  But if this deed be fulfilled, then Uni shall send
thee on to Studla (13) to Kyrping-Worm my kinsman, and his sons Ogmund
and Erling, and then methinks thou art as good as come home.  Bid Uni
after that to sell his land, and change his abode hither to me.”  Now
Hallvard busked him to this journey, and nothing is told of how he
fared, or where his night-quarters were, before he came one day at
evening to Uni’s house, and did not call himself by his own name.  Uni
and his household asked him about the news of the day, and at night when
men sat by the fires, then the guest asked much about high-born men
there in Sogn and Hördaland.  Uni said that none of the king’s liegemen
there was thought more powerful than John, both for his birth’s sake,
but still more for his unfairness, and asked whether they had not some
keepsakes of that down south in the land.  The guest he said little when
he (Uni) spoke thus;  and after that men dropped off from the fires one
by one, so that at last they two were left behind.  Then Uni began to
speak, and said thus:  “Is thy name Hallvard, pray?” says he.  “Nay,”
says the guest, and again gave the name he had given in the evening. 
Then Uni said:  “Off then is my difficulty,” says he, “and yet I would
have thought that if my name were Brynjulf, thine would be Hallvard; 
but still we two will now go to sleep.”  Then the guest took hold of
him, and said:  “No, we two will not go yet,” and with that he handed
him over the bag of money, and says that Kol sent him that silver, with
his greeting, “and why he sends it is that thou mayest lay a plan with
me that I may fulfil my revenge for my brother,” and then he tells him
all Kol’s counsel.  Uni said:  “Kol were worthy of good from me, but I
cannot tell how it is fated as to revenge on Brynjulf;  but he is looked
for hither tomorrow to fetch clothes from his sweetheart.”  And now Uni
led him out to the horse-stable which stood before the door outside, and
stowed him away there in the manger.  That was before men rose, but he
had lain indoors during the night.  Now, when Hallvard had been a little
while in the horse stable, he saw how a huge man had come up to the
homestead, and calls out that the woman must be quick;  she took her
clothes, and carries them out.  Then Hallvard thinks he knows who it
must be.  So he goes out.  Brynjulf had laid aside his arms while he
tied up the clothes which the woman brought, and as soon as ever they
meet, Hallvard smites Brynjulf his death-blow, and then went back again
into the horse stable, and hid himself there.  While the slaying was
going on the woman had gone into the house to kiss and take leave of her
friends in the household;  and when she came out she saw the tokens of
the deed, and ran in with a great shriek, and was in such a fright that
she was just about to faint away, but still she told them what had
happened.  Goodman Uni ran out, and said that the guest must have been a
hired murderer, and sent a man at once to John to tell these tidings,
and egged on men as much as he could to search for the man, and for that
no man suspected him of having anything to do with the deed.  Hallvard
was in the horse stable till the hottest of the chase had passed off,
but after that he fared by Uni’s help and counsel till he came to Studla
to Worm and his sons, and they got him company home east.  Kol and
Solmund made him welcome, and were well pleased with their share in the
matter;  and now these tidings are noised abroad, and men became aware
of the truth.  Now John is heavily displeased at this, and so that
winter and the summer after pass away;  and thenext winter when Yule was
drawing on, John busked him from home with thirty men, and gave it out
that he meant to go on a journey to see his kinsfolk up at Sæter to the
house of Harek, his mother’s father, and so he did, and gets there a
hearty welcome.  And when those kinsmen were talking together, John says
that he means to go thence to East Agdir to look up Solmund.  Harek
tried to turn him from this, and said he had not got the worst of it,
though they (John and Solmund) parted as they were.  John said he would
not be content that Brynjulf should be unavenged.  Harek said he thought
his lot would not be bettered, though they (John and Solmund) had any
further dealings in the matter;  but still he had with him away thence
thirty men, and so they fared east with half a hundred men (14) by the
upper road, and thought to come unawares upon Solmund and Kol.  But when
John was newly gone from home, Uni bestirred himself and fared south to
Studla to see Worm, and that father and son got him company south to
Kol, and he came there at Yule, and told them he thought that John was
on his way to attack them.  Kol sends out spies at once on all the ways
about him, by which he looked that John might come, and he fared to find
Solmund;  and those kinsmen sat with a great company.  News came to them
about John’s journey, and they fared against him;  their meeting was in
a wood;  they fell at once to battle;  Kol and his men were far more in
number, and had the victory.  But John lost many men and fled himself
into the woods.  He got a wound in his leg, and that healed so ill that
he was halt ever after, and was called limp-leg John.  He came home
north in Lent, and his journey was thought most shameful.  So now this
winter wore away.  But the summer after John made them slay two of Kol’s
kinsmen, Gunnar and Aslak.  A little after king Sigurd came to the town,
(15) and this difficulty was brought before him.  After that the king
sent word to both sides, and summoned them to him.  Then they came to
the king, with their kinsfolk and friends;  then an atonement was
sought, and the end of it was that the king’s doom should pass upon all
their quarrels, and either side plighted their troth to the other.  King
Sigurd made a settlement between them with the advice of the best men. 
It was so fixed in that settlement that John Peter’s son should take
Ingirid Kol’s daughter to wife, and then friendship would spring up with
those ties, while the manslaughters (of Havard and Brynjulf) were to be
set off one against the other.  The attack on Kol and John’s wound were
set off against the loss of men away there east, but the wounds on
either side were matched together and set off, and those that were odd
were atoned for in money.  Each side too was to yield help to the other
both at home and abroad.  It followed also on this settlement that king
Sigurd gave Kali Kol’s son half the Orkneys with earl Paul Hacon’s son,
and the title of earl too.  He also gave him the name of earl Rognvald
Brusi’s son, because his mother Gunnhilda said that he had been the most
proper man of all the Orkney earls, and thought the name would bring
good luck.  This share of the Orkneys Saint Magnus had owned,
Rognvald-Kali’s mother’s brother.  After this atonement they parted with
great love-tokens;  they who had erewhile been foes.

65.       That winter after king Sigurd sat in Oslo, (16) but about the
spring in Lent he took a sickness, and breathed his last one night after
Lady-day.  His son Magnus was then in the town there, and held a Thing
at once, and was taken to be king over all the land according to the
oath which men had sworn to king Sigurd.  Then he took the king’s
treasures into his power.  Harold Gilli was then at Tunsberg, (17) when
he heard of king Sigurd’s death, then he held meetings with his
friends.  Then he sent for Rognvald and his kindred, for he had always
been his friend (18) since they met in England.  That father and son too
had most hand in Harold’s clearing himself by ordeal before king Sigurd,
with the help of other liegemen, Ingimar Sweyn’s son and Thiostolf Ali’s
son.  The counsel of Harold and his friends was to hold the Hauga-Thing
there in Tunsberg.  There Harold was taken to be king over half the
land.  Then those were called force-oaths (19) by which he had sworn
away his fathers inheritance out of his hands before they would let him
take the ordeal.  Then men flocked to him and became hand-bound to him,
and he gathered a very great company.  Then words passed between those
kinsmen.  And it was so that seven nights passed ere a settlement was
brought about on these terms, that each of them should have half the
land against the other;  but king Magnus had (beside) king Sigurd’s
longship and his table furniture and all his treasures, and yet he still
was not content with his share.  He fastened feuds on all Harold’s
friends.  King Magnus too would not let that gift hold good by which
king Sigurd gave the Orkneys and the earldom to Rognvald, because he
clung very fast to Harold’s cause in all their quarrels, and would never
leave his cause till all their quarrels were brought to an end.  They,
Magnus and Harold, were three winters kings over Norway, so that their
settlement might be said to hold good, but the fourth summer they fought
at Fyrileif; (20) then king Magnus had near sixty hundred men, but
Harold had fifteen hundred.  These chiefs were with Harold:  Kristred
his brother, earl Rognvald, Ingimar of Ask, Thiostolf Ali’s son, and
Solmund.  King Magnus got the victory, but king Harold fled.  There fell
Kristred and Ingimar.  He (Ingimar) chanted this song: ---

“Friends befooled me

To Fyrileif field,

Aye was I unwilling

For onslaught of war;

Me bit bolts bitter

From crossbow sped,

Ne’er again shall I

To Ask (21) go back.”

         King Harold fled east to the Bay to his ships, and fared south
to Denmark to find king Eric the ever-memorable.  He gave him Halland as
a lordship and eight longships without tackle.  Thiostolf Ali’s son sold
his lands for ships and arms, and went to seek king Harold south in
Denmark that autumn.  King Harold came towards Yule to Bergen, and lay
over Yule-tide in Floru-voe. (22)  But after Yule they run up to the
town, and there was but a little struggle;  king Magnus was taken
captive on board his ship and maimed, but king Harold took all the land
under his sway.  But the next spring after king Harold renewed the gift
to Rognvald about the isles, and the title of earl as well.

66.       Kol gave this advice to send men to the Orkneys at once after
this, and (Rognvald) begged earl Paul that he would give up half the
isles as king Harold had given them to him;  then friendship and
thorough kinship should spring up between them.  But if earl Paul
refused these things, then these very same men should fare to find
Frakok and Oliver the unruly, and offer them half the lands with earl
Rognvald, if they would seek to get it from earl Paul with a host.  But
when these men came to the Orkneys and saw earl Paul, and brought
forward their errand there, then earl Paul answers:  “I understand this
claim, how it is made with mickle cunning and forethought;  they have
betaken themselves to the kings of Norway to get the realm away from
under me.  Now I will not reward that faithlessness by giving up my
realm to those who come no nearer to me than Rognvald, and by refusing
it to my brother’s son and my sister’s son.  There is no need here of
long words, for I will guard the Orkneys by the strength of my friends
and kinsfolk while God grants me life to do so.”  Then the messengers
saw how their errand was likely to turn out there.  So they fared away,
and went south over the Pentland firth to Caithness, and so into
Sutherland to find Frakok, and tell their errand there, how earl
Rognvald and Kol offer Oliver and Frakok half the Orkneys if they will
win them back from earl Paul.  Frakok speaks thus:  “True it is that Kol
is a very wise man, and wisely has it been seen to in this plan to look
hither for strength, because we kinsfolk have great strength, and many
men bound to us by ties.  I have now given away Margaret Hacon’s
daughter to earl Moddan of Athole, who is noblest of all the
Scottish-chiefs by birth.  Melmari his father was brother of Malcolm the
Scot-king, father of David, who is now the Scot-king.  We have also,”
she said, “many true claims to the Orkneys, but we are ourselves
something of schemers, and we are said to be rather deep-witted, so that
this strife does not come upon us unawares;  but still it seems good to
me to join fellowship with that father and son for many things’ sake. 
Ye shall say these words to Kol and Rognvald that we two, Oliver and I,
will come to the Orkneys next summer at midsummer with a host to fall on
earl Paul;  let Rognvald and his men come thither then to meet us, and
let us then fight it out with earl Paul;  but this winter I will draw
strength to me out of Scotland and the Southern isles from my kinsfolk
and friends and connexions.”  Now the messengers fare back east to
Norway, and tell that father and son how they had sped.

67.        That winter after this earl Rognvald busked him to fare west,
and these chiefs with him, Solmund and John;  they fared in the course
of the summer after, and had picked men, though not many;  (and) five or
six ships.  They come off Shetland at midsummer and heard nothing of
Frakok.  Then high and foul winds arose, and they laid their ships up in
Alasound, (23) but fared about to feasts and free-quarters over the land
and the freemen made them good cheer.  But of Frakok it must be told
that she fares in the spring out to the Southern isles, and she and
Oliver gather force thence to themselves in men and ships;  they got
twelve ships, and all of them small and rather thinly manned.  And near
midsummer they held on for the Orkneys, and mean to meet earl Rognvald,
as was said;  they were slow in getting a wind.  There Oliver the unruly
was leader of that host, and the earldom in the Orkneys was meant for
him if they could get it.  Frakok was there in the fleet too, and many
of her kith and kin.

68.       Earl Paul was then at Westness in Rowsay at a feast with
Sigurd, when he heard that earl Rognvald was come to Shetland;  then too
was heard how a host was gathering together in the Southern isles to
attack them.  Then the earl sent word to Kugi in Westray, and to
Thorkell flayer, they were wise men;  and many other chieftains he
summoned to him.  At this meeting the earl asked counsel of his friends,
but they did not all look on the matter in one way;  some wished to
share the realm with one or other (of the foe), and not to have both
against them, but some advised that the earl should fare over to the
Ness to his friends, and see what force he could get there.  Earl Paul
answers:  “I will not now offer my realm to those to whom I refused it
then right out when they sought it by fair means;  methinks too it is
unchieftainlike to fly my land without one trial of strength;  I will
take that counsel to send men tonight round all the isles to gather
force, and let us fare against Rognvald and his men as soon as we can,
and let our quarrel come to the sword'’ point ere the South-islanders
come."” This plan was taken which the earl spoke of.  That man was then
with earl Paul, whose name was Sweyn breastrope;  he was one of the
earl’s bodyguard, and well honoured of him;  he was ever on viking
voyages in the summer, but the winters he spent with earl Paul.  Sweyn
was a tall, strong man, swarthy and rather unlucky-looking;  he was very
fond of the old faith, and had all his life lain out at night (to follow
his black arts).  He was one of the earl’s forecastle men.  These chiefs
came at once that night to earl Paul;  Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son;  he had a
longship fully manned.  Olaf Hrolf’s son of Gairsay had another,
Thorkell flayer a third, Sigurd the master of the house there a fourth,
the fifth the earl had himself.  With these five ships they hold on to
Hrossey, and come there on the evening of the fifth day of the week
(Thursday evening) at sundown;  then force flocked to them during the
night, but they got no more ships.  They meant the day after to sail to
Shetland against Rognvald and his men.  But next morning, when it had
got light, and the sun was just up, those men came to the earl, who said
they had seen longships fairing from the south on the Pentland firth; 
they said they could not tell whether there were ten or twelve of them. 
The earl and his men made up their minds that there must be coming
Frakok’s host.  Then the earl bade them to get ready to row against them
as hard and as fast as they could.  Then they, Olaf and Sigurd begged
him to take time about it, and said men would come into them every
hour.  And lo!  as they rowed east from Tankarness, longships come
sailing against them from the east round the Mull, and they were twelve
in all.  Then the earl and his men lashed their ships together.  Then
came to him Erling, the master of Tankarness, and his sons, and offered
him his help.  By that time they were so thronged on board their ships
that they thought they could find room for no more men.  Then the earl
bade Erling to bring down stones for them while they were in no risk of
attack.  And when they had made all clear for fight, Oliver and his side
came up, and gave them an onslaught by rowing at once, and they had far
more men, but smaller ships.  Oliver had a great ship, and he laid that
against the earl’s ship.  There was then the hardest fight.  Olaf
Hrolf’s son, laid his ship against the smaller ships of Oliver, and
there was a great difference in the height of the sides, and in a short
while he cleared the decks of three ships.  Oliver made such a hard
onslaught on the earl’s ship, that all the forecastle men gave way and
fled aft of the mast.  Then Oliver egged on his men to board, and goes
himself the first man up.  Sweyn breastrope was the foremost of all the
earl’s men, and fought most stoutly.  Earl Paul sees now that Oliver was
come up on board his ship, and eggs on his men fast;  he leaps down
himself from the poop, and springs forward in the ship, and when Oliver
saw that, he snatched up a boat-hook, and hurled it at the earl, and it
fell upon his shield, and down he fell at once on the planks.  Then
there was a great shout.  And at that moment Sweyn breastrope snatched
up a great stone and hurled it at Oliver, and hit him full in the
breast;  the blow was so great that he tumbled at once overboard, and
sank in the sea.  His men got hold of him, and then he was drawn up into
his ship, and he lay there senseless, and men knew not whether he were
dead or alive.  Then some ran and hewed the lashings asunder, and were
for flying, and then all Oliver’s men were driven down from the earl’s
ship.  Then they took to flying.  Just then Oliver came to himself, and
bade them not to fly;  but then no one made as though he knew what he
said:  The earl chased the flying ships east of Hrossey, and so farther
east of Hrossey and Rognvaldsey, and so into the Pentland firth;  then
they drew away from one another.  Then the earl turns back, and where
they had fought five ships of Oliver’s fleet lay empty and unmanned. 
The earl took them for his own, and manned them with his followers.  The
fight took place on the Fastday (Friday), but that night the earl made
them put their ships into trim.  Then many men gathered to him, and two
longships.  Next morning he had twelve ships, and all in good trim and
well manned.  Saturday he sailed to Shetland, and came by night into
Alasound unawares to those who watched earl Rognvald’s ships;  then earl
Paul made them slay the men, but took the ships and the goods to
himself.  But next morning news came to Rognvald and his men;  they
rushed together and had a great gathering of the freemen;  after that
they fared down to the strand, and then egg on Paul and his men to come
on shore and fight with them.  But earl Paul put no trust in the
Shetlanders, and therefore would not go on land, but offered that they
should get them ships and fight it out on shipboard.  But Rognvald and
his men saw that they could get no ships in which they could fight on
fair terms.  And so they parted as things stood.  Earl Paul and his men
fared back to the Orkneys, but earl Rognvald and his men were in
Shetland all that summer, but at autumn they got carried in ships to
Norway by divers chapmen, and their voyage was thought rather shameful. 
But when earl Rognvald came home, and he and his father met, Kol asks
whether Rognvald was ill content with his lot.  He says he thinks very
little had come of his errand, and that little rather unworthily.  Kol
says:  “I do not think so though;  methinks the errand has been good,
and that much has been done if the Shetlanders are your friends, and
that it is better to have gone than not to have gone.”  Rognvald says: 
“If thou praisest this voyage, then it must either be that thou must
care less about our lot than I thought, or thou must see something in
our voyage which we have not yet thought of seeing.  I should be very
glad now that thou shouldest lay down a plan for us and be thyself on
the voyage with us.”  Kol says:  “Both of these things now shall not be
done;  say all your work is easy, but come one self’s never near the
spot.  I shall be very glad to use my counsel so as not to swerve from
your honour.”  Rognvald answers:  “We will willingly follow the advice
thou givest.”  Kol says:  “My first advice is that thou sendest word to
king Harold and other of thy friends that they get thee force and ships
for a western voyage early in the spring, but we will draw to us all the
strength we can get this winter, and let us so lay our plans this second
time that one of two things may be, either that we get the Orkneys, or
else lay our bones there.”  Rognvald answers:  “The thought dwells in my
mind not to fare on many more such voyages as this which we have now
fared;  and such, I ween, is the thought of most of those who lately
fared with us.”

69.       Earl Paul fared to the Orkneys after that he had taken the
ships of earl Rognvald and his men;  he had then to boast over a great
victory.  Then he had a great feast and bade to him his chieftains. 
There then was taken that counsel to pile up (24) a beacon in the Fair
Isle;  fire was to be put to it if a host were seen sailing from
Shetland.  Then there was another on Rinansey (North Ronaldsay), and so
on in more of the isles, so that it might be seen all over the isles if
war were coming on them.  Then too men were set to call out men round
all the islands;  Thorstein Havard’s son, Gunni’s son, was to have
Rinansey, but his brother Magnus was to have Sanday, Kugi (was to be on
the watch) round Westray, Sigurd of Westness on Rowsay, Olaf Hrolf’s son
fared to Duncansby in Caithness, and had the wardship there.  His son
Waltheof dwelt then in Stronsay.  Then earl Paul granted gifts to his
friends, and all promised him their thorough friendship.  He kept many
men about him that autumn, until he learned that Rognvald and his men
were away from Shetland.  Then no tidings happened in the islands, and
so it went on up to Yule.  Earl Paul had a great Yule-feast, and made
ready for it at that homestead of his which is called Orfir;  he bade
thither many noble men.  Thither was bidden Waltheof Olaf’s son out of
Stronsay. (25)  They set off ten of them in a ten-oared boat, and they
were all lost in the West-firth the day before Yule, and that was
thought great tidings, for Waltheof one of the best-bred of men.  His
father Olaf had a great train of followers in Caithness;  there were his
sons Sweyn and Gunni, and the sons of Grim of Swanay, Asbjorn and
Margad, but Asleif the mistress of the house and her son Gunni had gone
to a feast at a friend’s house no long way off.  These tidings happened
at Duncansby three nights before Yule that Sweyn Olaf’s son had rowed
out to fish, and those brothers Asbjorn and Margad with him.  They
always went about with him, and were the briskest and bravest of men. 
But in the night after they had gone away came Oliver the unruly to
Duncansby with that train which had followed him on his viking voyage
that summer, and seized the house over Olaf’s head and set fire to it at
once, and burned him inside it and six men with him, but allowed the
others in the house to go out.  They took there all the chattels and
goods, and went away after they had done that deed.  Sweyn, who was
afterwards called Asleif’s son, came home before the first day of Yule,
and fared at once north on the Pentland firth;  he came about midnight
to Swanay to the house of Grim, the father of Asbjorn and his brother. 
Grim got into a ship with them, and they put Sweyn across to Knarstead
on Scapa-neck.  Arnkell was the name of the man who kept house there,
and his sons’ names were Hanef and Sigurd.  Grim and his sons turned
back thence, and Sweyn gave Grim a gold finger-ring.  Hanef and his
brother Sigurd brought Sweyn to Orfir;  there he had a hearty welcome; 
men guided him to Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son, Sweyn’s kinsman.  Eyvind led
Sweyn before earl Paul, and the earl greeted Sweyn well and asked him
what news, but Sweyn tells the death of his father, with all that had
happened.  The earl was ill pleased at that, and said that he had
suffered a great loss;  he asked Sweyn to be with him, and said that he
would do him great honour.  Sweyn thanks the earl kindly for his
bidding, and said he would willingly accept it.

70.       After that men went to even-song.  There was a great homestead
there, and it stood on the side of a slope, and there was a steep hill
at the back of the house, and when one came on to the brow of the hill,
Orrida-firth lay down below.  In it lies Damsay.  There was a castle in
the island, and that man guarded it whose name was Blann, a son of
Thorstein of Flidruness.  There in Orfir was a great drinking hall, and
there was a door at the east gable from the south in the side wall, and
a noble church stood before the hall door, and one went down steps from
the hall into the church.  But as one went into the hall, there was on
the left hand a great flat stone, and further on inside ale-casks, both
many and great, but when one passed through the doorway there was a
small room facing one. (26)  When men were come from even-song, they
were ranged in seats.  The earl made Sweyn Asleif’s son sit next to him
on the inside, but on the outside of the earl Sweyn breastrope sat next
him, and then John the kinsman of Sweyn breastrope.  When the board was
cleared those men came who told of the drowning of Waltheof Olaf’s son; 
and the earl thought that great news.  Then the earl bade that no one
should tease Sweyn Asleif’s son while Yule lasted, and said that even
then he would have enough to think on.  And at even, when men had drunk,
the earl and most men with him went to sleep.  But Sweyn breastrope went
out, and sat out all night, in heathen rites, as was his wont.  And
during the night men rose and went to church and heard prayers, and
after high mass men sat down at the board.  Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son had
most of the management of the feast with the earl, and did not sit down
himself.  The waiting-men and torch-bearers stood before the earl’s
table, but Eyvind poured out the drink into the cup of each of those
namesakes.  Then Sweyn breastrope thought that Eyvind filled his cup
higher, and would not touch it before Sweyn Asleif’s son had drunk off
his cup, and said Sweyn (Asleif’s son) drank unfairly.  There had long
been no love lost between Sweyn breastrope and Olaf Hrolf’s son, and so
too between those namesakes since Swein Asleif’s son grew up to be a
man.  And when drinking had gone on a while, then they went to Nones. 
But when men came in again, then healths and memories were solemnly
spoken of, and horns were drained.  Then Sweyn breastrope would change
horns with his namesake, and said he thought it was a little one.  Then
Eyvind thrust a great horn into Sweyn Asleif’s son’s hand, and he
offered that to his namesake.  Then Sweyn breastrope got wrath, and said
to himself between his lips, so that some men, and the earl among the
rest, heard him:  “Sweyn will be Sweyn’s death, and Sweyn shall be
Sweyn’s death.”  This was hushed up at once, and now the drinking went
on up to even-song.  And when the earl went out, then Sweyn Asleif’s son
went before him, but Sweyn breastrope sat behind and drank.  But when
they came out into the ale-room, Eyvind came after them, and led Sweyn
aside to talk.  “Heardest thou,” he asked, “what thy namesake said when
thou hadst offered him the horn?”  “No,” he said.  Then Eyvind repeated
the words, and said that the fiend must have put those words into his
mouth during the night.  “He must mean thee death, but thou shalt be
beforehand with him in the deed, and slay him."” Eyvind put an axe into
his hand, and bade him stand by the flat stone in the shade, and told
him to give Sweyn the blow in front if John went before him, but if John
went behind, then he bade Sweyn to deal his namesake the blow behind. 
The earl went to church, and no one gave heed to Eyvind and Sweyn.  But
Sweyn breastrope and John went out a little later than the earl.  Sweyn
breastrope had a sword in his hand, for he always bore his sword, though
others were weaponless, and John went first.  It was light up to the
doorway, but the weather was thick.  And when Sweyn breastrope came to
the doorway, Sweyn Asleif’s son smote him in front on the forehead, and
he stumbled forward at the blow, but did not fall.  And when he stood
straight again, then he saw a man standing at the door, and thought it
must be he that had wounded him.  Then he drew his sword, and dealt him
a blow with it on the head, and clave him down to the shoulders;  but it
was his kinsman John on whom the blow fell, and there they both fell
down.  Then Eyvind came up and led Sweyn Asleif’s son into that room
which was over against the doorway, and he was there drawn out at a
window-slit. (27)  There Magnus Eyvind’s son has a horse ready saddled,
and guided him away at the back of the homestead, and so to
Orrida-firth.  Then they took ship, and Magnus carried Sweyn to Damsay,
and brought him to the castle;  but Blann carried him next morning north
to Egil’s isle to meet bishop William.  The bishop was then at prayers
when they came thither.  And after mass Sweyn was brought by stealth to
the bishop, and Sweyn tells him the tidings, the death of his father
Olaf and of Waltheof, and the slaying of Sweyn and John, and called on
the bishop to shelter him.  The bishop thanked him for the slaying of
Sweyn breastrope, and said that had been a cleansing of the land.  The
bishop let Sweyn stay there till Yule was over;  but after that he sent
him into the Southern isles to Tyree, to that man whose name was
Holdbodi, and who was Hundi’s son;  he was a great chief there, and gave
Sweyn a very hearty welcome.  He stayed there that winter, and was
thought of much worth by all the people.

71.     A little while after those manslayings had taken place in Orfir
men ran up from the church, and Sweyn was borne inside the house, for he
had not yet drawn his last breath, though he had lost his senses.  He
died in the course of the night.  Then the earl made every man take his
seat, and wanted to be sure who it was that had caused the slayings; 
and then Sweyn Asleif’s son was missing.  Then men thought it clear that
Sweyn had slain them.  Then Eyvind came up and said:  “Any man can see
that Sweyn breastrope must have given John his death.”  The earl said
that no man should blow a hair off Sweyn’s (1) head, and says he would
not have done this without a cause.  “But if he takes himself off from
meeting me,” says he, “then he will be doing himself an ill turn by
that.” (2)  Men thought it most likely that Sweyn  would have gone to
Paplay to Hacon churl, brother of earl Magnus the saint;  he was a great
chief, mild and gentle.  The earl heard no news of Sweyn that winter,
and made them make him an outlaw.  When the spring began the earl fared
far and near about the north isles to get in his rents.  He made great
friends with the great men, and gave away almost with both hands.  The
earl came into Stronsay, and gave Thorkell flayer that farm which
Waltheof Olaf’s son had owned, for the sake of knowing where Sweyn had
settled down.  Thorkell spoke and said:  “It does not turn out now as
the saying goes, ‘Many are a king’s ears.’  But though thou beest earl,
still it seems to me wonderful that though hast heard no tidings of
Sweyn, for I knew at once that bishop William sent him to the Southern
isles to Holdbodi Hundi’s son, and there he has been this winter.”  The
earl said:  “What shall I do to the bishop who has dared to do this?” 
Thorkell answers:  “No blame must be given to the bishop for this in the
face of what now lies at the door;  thou wilt need all thy friends if
Rognvald and his men come from the east.”  The earl says, “that what he
says is true.”  Earl Paul fared thence to Rinansey (North Ronaldsay),
and accepted feast at mistress Ragna’s house and Thorstein’s her son. 
Ragna was a wise woman.  They had another farm in Papay. (3)  The earl
sat there three nights, for he could not get a wind to Kugi’s house in
Westray.  They, Ragna and the earl, talked much, and she says to the
earl that he had little loss in Sweyn breastrope, even though he was a
great warrior.  “Thou gottest from him many feuds;  it were my counsel,
in the face of that trouble which stares you in the face, that ye make
you as many friends as you can, and not be fault-finding.  I would too
that ye laid no blame on bishop William or the other kinsmen of Sweyn
Asleif’s son;  but I would rather that thou wouldest forgive the bishop
thy wrath, and this besides, that thou wouldest let word be sent to the
Southern isles for Sweyn, and forgive him thy wrath too, and give him
back his estates on condition that he will be to thee such a man as his
father was.  It has always been the custom of the noblest men to do much
for the sake of their friends, and so to gather to themselves force and
friendship."  The earl answers:  “Thou art a wise wife, Ragna, but still
thou has not yet gotten the title of earl in the Orkneys;  thou shalt
not rule the land here.  A pretty thing indeed that I should give Sweyn
goods for an atonement, and think that I should win victory for my side
in that way!”  He gets wrath about this, and said:  “God settle matters
between my kinsman earl Rognvald and me, and let things so go as each
has deserved by his deeds.  If I have misdone towards him, then it is
time that I should atone for it;  but if so be his aim is to get my
realm, then methinks that man my best friend who aids me, that I may be
able to hold my realm.  Rognvald I have never yet seen;  and this is
why, so far as my knowledge goes, I have all the less done him any
wrong, because whatever our kinsfolk may have caused to be done, men
know well enough that I had no share in those things.”  Many answered
that it was quite unpardonabl for any one to try and strive with him for
the realm, but no one spoke against him.  When the spring began to wear
away, earl Paul made them pile up the beacons in the Fair Isle and
Rinansey, and in almost all the isles, so that each might be seen from
the other.  There was a man named Dagfinn Hlodver’s son, who kept house
on the Fair Isle, a brisk stirring man;  he was to watch that beacon and
set fire to it if a host were seen faring from Shetland.

Earl Rognvald sat that winter at home in Agdir on the farms of that
father and son, and sent word to his friends and kinsfolk;  but some he
went to see, and begged that they would aid him in his voyage west both
in men and ships, and most of them turned a willing ear to his wants. 
But about February Kol sent two ships of burden out of the land, one
west to England to buy stores and weapons, but in the other Solmund
sailed south to Denmark to buy there what Kol bade him, for he has now
all the business of fitting them out in his hands.  It was so meant that
these ships of burden should come back to Norway at Easter, but they
mean to set sail on the voyage after Easter week.  So it was done, and
they held on from the east after Easter week.  Each of that pair, father
and son, had his own long-ship, but Solmund had the third.  Kol and his
son had besides a ship of burden laden with stores.  But when they came
to Bergen, they found king Harold there;  he gave Rognvald a long-ship
fully trimmed and manned.  John limp-leg had also a long-ship.  The
sixth Aslak, son of Erlend of Hern had;  he was a daughter’s son of
Steigar-Thorir.  He too had a ship of burden laden with stores.  They
had six large ships, five cutters, and three ships of burden.  When they
lay waiting for a wind at Hern, a ship ran in from the west, and they
heard news from the Orkneys and Shetland, and what preparations earl
Paul was taking, if earl Rognvald came thither west with a host that
summer.

72.    Earl Rognvald let them blow the trumpets to call together a
house-Thing (4) while they lay in Hern, (5) and spoke then of earl
Paul’s preparations, and how great feud the Orkneyingers showed towards
him when they meant to keep him from the inheritance of his kinsfolk,
after the kings of Norway had given it to him as the rightful heir.  And
so he makes them a long and clever speech, --- I meant, he said, “so to
go to the Orkneys as either to get them or else die.”  Men gave him
great praise for his speech, and promised him trustier following.  Then
Kol stood up and said:  “We have heard from the Orkneys how all men
there will rise up against you, and keep you from your realm, siding
with earl Paul;  and be sure, kinsman, that they will be slow to lay
down that feud which they have taken up against you.  Now, it is my
counsel to look for trust thither where there is enough of it and to
spare, that he may give you your realm who owns it by right;  but that
is the saint earl Magnus, your mother’s brother.  My wish is that though
vowest to him, if he will grant thee the inheritance of thy kindred and
make thee his heir, that thou wilt let a stone minster be built in the
Orkneys at Kirkwall if thou canst get that realm, so that there shall
not be another as splendid in that land, and let it be hallowed in the
name of Saint Magnus the earl thy kinsman, and that thou wilt lay out
money, so that the church may grow and thrive, and that thither may come
his halidom, together with the bishop’s seat.”  This all thought good
advice.  And that vow was fast made.  After that they put to sea, and
they got a fair wind, and made Shetland, and each were glad at meeting
the others.  The Shetlanders were able to tell them many tidings from
the Orkneys, and so they stayed there some time.

73.    It chanced once that Kol asks Uni, for he was then there, and had
changed his abode to that of Kol and his son, after he had taken part in
the plot against Brynjulf.  Then Kol asks:  “Whether of the twain wilt
thou, Uni, give counsel how the beacon in the Fair Isle may be set on
fire for naught, or undertake that work that another beacon may not be
lighted.  I speak to thee about this because I know that thou art wiser
than most of the others who are now here, though we have here many men
of worth.”  Uni answers:  “I am no man for advice, but still less would
I make a rush to war by my plans.  I will therefore rather choose what
shall be done last, because I mean to take the doing of it all on
myself.” (6)  And a little after, one day when the weather was fair, Kol
made them fit out many small ships, and turned his course towards the
Orkneys.  There were no chiefs on board the ships but Kol.  And when
they come so far that they think their fleet might be seen from the Fair
Isle, then Kol made them hoist the sails on all the ships, and set men
to back water with the oars, so that the ships might move as slowly as
possible, though the wind was right aft;  and he made them set the sails
no higher than half-mast, and so hoist them higher and higher up as they
had gone further on.  Kol says that then their fleet would be seen from
the Fair Isle, “\[and it would seem\] as though the ships were coming
near to the isle. (7)  May be then that they will set fire to the
beacon, and there will be a rush to arms all over the islands.”  Then
Dagfinn of the Fair Isle saw the ships sailing and he set fire to the
beacon at once, but fared himself to the earl and told him the news. 
And as soon as ever the beacon was seen on the Fair Isle, then Thorstein
Ragna’s son made them kindle the beacon on Rinansey.  And after that all
the others were lit one after the other over all the isles.  But all the
freemen fared to meet the earl, and that was the greatest
war-gathering.  But when Kol saw that the beacon was a-blaze, he bade
his men fare back;  and said it might so happen that this would be a
cause of quarrel to some of them;  Kol fares back to Shetland after he
had done thus much, and says that now Uni shall betake himself to his
plans.  Uni calls three Shetlanders to go along with him;  they take a
six-oared boat and a few stores beside and fishing-tackle.  They fared
to the Fair Isle, and Uni said he was a Norseman, but gives out that he
had wedded in Shetland and had sons there;  he says too he had been
robbed by earl Rognvald’s men, and speaks the hardest things of them. 
He takes up his abode in a house there, and his sons row out to fish; 
but he stays at home to watch their stores and catch.  He gets to
speaking with and to knowing those men who take the lead there, and they
are well pleased with him.

74.        After that Dagfinn had set fire to the beacon, he set off to
find earl Paul, as was before said, and thither came all the earl’s
chieftains.  Then they took to asking every one about the doings of earl
Rognvald and his men;  and men thought it wonderful when they showed
themselves nowhere.  But still they kept the force together three days. 
Then the freemen began to take it ill, and say that it was great folly
to burn the beacons, though fishermen were seen sailing in their boats. 
Then blame was laid on Thorstein Ragna’s son that he had done a bad
thing when he kindled the beacon on Rinansey.  Thorstein answers, and
says he could do nothing else than fire the beacon, when he saw the
blaze on the Fair Isle, and said this had been all Dagfinn’s doing. 
Dagfinn answers:  “Men far more often get ill from thee than though art
able to say the same of me.”  Thorstein bade him hold his tongue, and
sprang up to him with an axe, and smote him there and then his
death-blow.  Then men sprang to arms and a battle arose.  This was in
Hrossey, a little way from Kirkwall.  Sigurd of Westness and his sons
Hacon pike and Brynjulf aided Hlodver Dagfinn'’ father, but his own kin
helped Thorstein.  Then this was told the earl, and he came up, but it
was long ere he could get them parted.  Then Kugi of Westray speaks a
long speech, and says thus:  "Do not do the earl this shame, that ye
fall to blows among yourselves, for ye will need all your men within a
little time.  Let us take heed then that we be not unhandy or
quarrelsome.  But as for this, it must have come about by the will and
plan of our foes, and it must have been a trick of theirs to waste the
beacons thus.  But now they may be looked for to come every day, and so
let us take counsel and make our plans.  No ill-will could have driven
Dagfinn to do as he did, but he was a little more hasty than he ought to
have been.”  This guess of Kugi was the very truth, and so he went on
with many wise words.  So it came about that each side was willing that
the earl should settle the matter;  but still it was thought best to
break up the gathering, and men went home.  But that man was set to
watch the beacon in the Fair Isle whose name was Eric.  And when Uni had
been a little while in the Fair Isle, he came to Eric and said:  “Wilt
thou that I watch the beacon? since I do naught else, and I may well sit
and spend all my time on it.”  Eric accepted that.  But as soon as ever
no men were near to the spot, Uni threw water on the beacon, and made it
so wet that fire had no hold of it anywhere.

75.        Earl Rognvald and his men agreed that they would wait until
the spring tides and east wind set in together, for then it is scarcely
possible to pass between Westray and Hrossey, but with an east wind one
may sail from Shetland to Westray.  And so earl Rognvald and his men
profited by this, and came on Friday evening to Westray into Hofn, to
the house of Helgi, who lived there.  No signs were then given by the
beacons, for when the sails were seen from the Fair Isle, Eric busked
him to go to earl, and sent men to Uni to bid him fire the beacon, but
when that man came thither, Uni was off and away.  And when that man
wanted to fire the beacon, then it was so wet that the fire would not
catch it.  And when Eric hears this, he thinks he sees how things have
gone.  After that he fares to find earl Paul, and tells him.  But when
earl Rognvald was come into Westray, all the island blades gathered
together, and they, Kugi and Helgi, take counsel for them.  The first
thing was to seek for peace from the earl.  And the end of this business
was that the Westrayingers come under earl Rognvald’s power, and swear
oaths to him.

76.  On the Sunday after earl Rognvald heard mass there in the thorpe,
and they were standing outside by the church.  Then they saw how sixteen
men walked without weapons and bald.  Them they thought wonderously
boun.  The earl’s men talked together, and asked who these men might
be.  Then the earl sang a song:

“Sixteen have I seen at once---

Topknots fell about their brows,

Shield or weapon bore they none, ---

Women all together walk;

We bore witness now to this,

That here west are far the most

Shaveling maidens in this isle,

In the main it lies in tempests.”

         When the Sunday was over earl Rognvald’s men fared there about
the country round, and all men came under the earl’s power.  It fell out
one night in Westray that the earl’s men had news that the islanders
were to have a secret meeting to plot against earl Rognvald.  But when
the earl got news of that, then he arose and went to the meeting.  But
it happened that the earl’s men had beaten many of the island blades,
and taken master Kugi and put him in fetters, and said he was at the
bottom of this plot.  But when earl Rognvald came to the meeting Kugi
fell at his feet and laid all his cause in God’s hand and the earl’s; 
he said he had been brought to the meeting against his will, for all the
freemen wished him to be foreman in the plot.  Kugi pleaded his own
cause well and glibly, and many others pleaded with him, and tried to
prove what he said to be true.  Then the earl chanted this:

                        “Crooked fetters I see lying

                        On the legs of greybeard Kugi,

                        Kugi, worst of midnight plotters,

                        Fetters now forbid thy straying!

                        Kugi!  never hold again

                        Midnight tryst nor bargain break,

                        Thou shalt be shut out from guile,

                        Take an oath and keep it too.”

         The earl gave all the men there peace.  Then they bound their
fellowship anew \[with oaths\].

77.  When earl Rognvald had come into the Orkneys and many men had come
under his power, Paul was in Hrossey, and he and his friends held a
Thing and took counsel with their men.  The earl asked for advice as to
how he should behave in this strait.  But men handled it in various
ways, and it was counsel of some that the lands should be shared with
earl Rognvald;  but most of the mighty men, and the freemen too, wished
to buy earl Rognvald off with money, and offered there and then help to
do it.  Some were eager to have a fight for it, and said that had turned
out well before.  Earl Rognvald had had spies at the meeting, and when
they come to him, the earl asked the news.  A skald who had been at the
Thing answered the earl: (8)

                        “Mighty chief!  I hear that our

                        Foemen hide a hostile mind,

                        From the freemen at the meeting

                        This report I also heard,

                        That the feeders of the wolf,

                        Many masters too of ships,

                        Wished thy ships to keep the sea,

                        But for Paul to hold the land.”

         After that earl Rognvald sent men to find the bishop and begged
him to become a daysman (9) between them, and (he) sent for Thorstein
Ragna’s son, and Thorstein Havard’s son out of Sanday, and bade them to
go with him and try to make a settlement and to stand by neither side in
making any strife;  and when they came to the bishop they fared
altogether to find earl Paul, and he (the bishop) tried to make a
settlement between those kinsmen.  The bishop brought this about, that
peace was fixed for half a month, that they might try to make a more
lasting settlement.  Then the isles were shared into lots, where either
earl should have his living during that time.  Then earl Rognvald fared
to Hrossey, but earl Paul fared to Rowsay.  And in that time these
tidings happened in the isles, that those kinsmen of Swein Asleif’s son,
John wing of the Upland in Hoy, and Richard of the Brink in Stronsay,
fared against Thorkell flayer to that farm which Waltheof had owned, and
burned him inside it, and nine men with him.  They fared after that to
find earl Rognvald, and gave him that choice, that they would join earl
Paul with all their kin if earl Rognvald would not take to them.  The
earl did not turn them away from him.  And when Haflidi Thorkell’s son
heard that, he fared at once to find earl Paul, as soon as he heard of
his father’s burning, and earl Paul took to him.  After that John and
his kinsfolk bound themselves as earl Rognvald’s liegemen.  He soon had
a great following there in the isles, and was much beloved.  Earl
Rognvald gave John and Solmund and Aslak and many other of his helpers
leave to go home;  but they wished to stay and see how things would turn
out.  Then earl Rognvald said:  “My thought is, if God wills that I
should get rule in the Orkneys, that he will give me strength, and so
will the saint earl Magnus, my kinsman, to hold it, even though ye fare
home to your estates.”  After that they fared home to Norway, each of
them to his own abode.

78.    That spring early Sweyn Asleif’s son had fared away from the
Southern isles up into Scotland to see his friends.  He stayed a long
time in Athole with earl Moddad and Margaret Hacon’s daughter, and they
talked about many things in secret.  There Sweyn heard of strife from
the Orkneys, and he grew eager to fare thither and find his kinsfolk. 
He fared first to Caithness to Thurso, and a noble man with him whose
name was Ljotolf;  with him Sweyn had been long that spring.  They came
to earl Ottar’s house in Thurso, Frakok’s brother, and Ljotolf tried to
bring about a settlement between Ottar and Sweyn for what Frakok had
caused to be done, and earl Ottar paid down the fines for the atonement
on his own behalf.  The earl also gave his word that he would be friends
with Sweyn, but Sweyn promised earl Ottar to strengthen Erlend the son
of Harold smooth-tongue, so that he might get back his father’s
inheritance in the Orkneys when he laid claim to it.  Sweyn there
changed ships, and had a ship of burden thence, and thirty men on board
her.  Thence he took a northwest wind across the Pentland firth, and so
west of Hrossey, and so to Evie sound, and so up the sound to Rowsay. 
At the isle’s end was a high headland, and a great heap of stones under
it beneath;  and there otters often lay among the rocks.  And as Sweyn
and his men were rowing along the sound, he began to speak, and said: 
“There are men yonder on the headland, and we will run in thither and
learn the news of them.  My will now is that men should change their
trim a little;  we will take to our hammocks;  and there twenty men
shall lie down, but ten shall row; (10) we will go softly and slowly.” 
But when they neared the isle, men call out from the head that they must
row to Westness, and bring to earl Paul what they had on board ship. 
They thought they were speaking to chapmen.  But earl Paul had been that
night at Westness to a feast in Sigurd’s house.  The earl had risen up
betimes, and he and nineteen men had gone south on the isle to hunt
otters which lay among the rocks under the head.  They meant to be back
home in time for their morning draught.  The men on board the ship of
burden rowed to land, and they asked one another of this thing and that,
and what the men were called whom they had met.  The men in the ship of
burden told whence they had come;  they ask also where the earl might
be.  They tell them that he was there on the rocks.  Sweyn and his men
heard that as they lay in their hammocks;  and Sweyn then told them to
run the ship in so that she might not be seen from the head.  Then Sweyn
said that they must arm themselves, and fall at once on the earl’s men
when they met.  And so they do.  There they slew nineteen men, but six
of Sweyn’s men fell.  They took earl Paul by force, and led him on board
their ship, and turned their stem to the sea, and fared back the same
way west of Hrossey, and ran in between Hoy and Grimsey, and so east of
Swelg, (11) thence south to Broad firth, and up it to Ekkjalsbakka.
(12)  There he left his ship and twenty men, but he and the rest fared
till he came to Athole and met earl Maddad and Margaret earl Paul’s
sister.  There they had a hearty welcome, and earl Maddad set earl Paul
in his own high-seat.  And when they had sat down, in came Margaret
walking with a great train of women, and threw her arms round her
brother.  After that men were brought in to amuse them.  Earl Paul was
rather short of words, as was not wonderful that he should have great
misgivings.  Nothing has been handed down of earl Paul’s words, or of
Sweyn’s as they were faring both together.  Earl Maddad and Margaret and
Sweyn Asleif’s son went into a room and talked together.  But at even
after drink Sweyn and his captive were shown the way to a sleeping-house
all alone, and they were locked in there, and so it went on every
evening while they were there.

79.    It happened one day that Margaret gave out that Sweyn Asleif’s
son was going to the Orkneys to see earl Rognvald, and give him his
choice whether he would rather have earl Paul to rule with him in the
Orkneys, or Harold, son of Maddad and herself, who was three winters
old.  And when earl Paul heard of that, he answers:  “As to my mind, it
is to be said that I fared away so from my realm that men will never
have heard of such doings before:  nor will I ever go back to the
Orkneys.  I see that this vengeance must be given of God for the robbery
of me and my kinsmen;  but if it seems to God that the realm is mine,
then will I give it to Harold, if he may live to enjoy it;  but as for
me, I wish that money may be given me to settle me in some cloister, and
then keep ye watch and ward, so that I do not get away thence.  But my
wish is, Sweyn, that thou farest to the Orkneys, and sayest that I am
blinded, or even more maimed, for my friends will seek me out if I am
sound and hale in all my limbs.  It may then be that I may not be able
to forego faring back to my realm with them, for I guess they will think
there is more harm in our parting than will really befall them.”  No
more words of the earl are handed down than these.  After that Sweyn
Asleif’s son fared to the Orkneys, but earl Paul stayed behind in
Scotland.  And this is the story that Sweyn told of what had happened. 
But some men tell a story which is less seemly, that Margaret had led
Sweyn Asleif’s son by her counsel to blind earl Paul her brother, and
put him into a dark dungeon;  but after that she got another man to take
his life there.  But we do not know which of the two stories is more
true;  but all men know that he never afterwards came back to the
Orkneys, nor held he any rule in Scotland.

80.   These tidings happened at Westness, when the earl’s home-coming
grew late, then Sigurd, the master of the house, made them send men to
look for them;  but when they got to where the pile of rocks was, they
saw the bodies of the slain.  Then they thought the earl must have
fallen there;  fared home and told these tidings.  Sigurd fared at once
to the spot to see and reckon the dead, and they found there nineteen of
the earl’s men, but there were six men besides there whom they knew
not.  After that Sigurd sent men to Egil’s isle to find the bishop and
to tell him these tidings.  And the bishop fared at once to see Sigurd,
and they fell to talk of these tidings, and Sigurd guessed that this
must have been by the plotting of earl Rognvald.  But the bishop answers
that some other proof must be brought forward before he would believe
that earl Rognvald had betrayed earl Paul his kinsman.  “I guess,” says
the bishop, “that some others must have wrought this ill deed.”  Borgar
the son of Jatvor Erlend’s daughter, who dwelt at Goathill, (13) he had
seen the ship of burden when it fared from the south, and fared back
south.  But when that was heard, then men thought that this must have
been by the plotting of Frakok and Oliver the unruly.  But when these
tidings were noised about the isles, that earl Paul was away and gone,
and no man knew what was become of him, then they sought counsel among
themselves, and there were very many who then fared to find earl
Rognvald, and swore fealty to him.  But Sigurd of Westness, and his sons
Brynjulf and Hakon pike, said they would swear oaths to no man, while
they were without news of earl Paul, whether he were to be looked for
back or not.  There were more men too who refused to take oaths to earl
Rognvald, but there were some who laid down a time or a day when they
would come over into his hand if nothing was then heard of earl Paul. 
But when earl Rognvald saw that he had to do with many mighty men, then
he took crossly nothing that the freemen asked.  And so time went on,
that every now and then he held Things with the freemen, and from time
to time some of them came over to his hand at each Thing.

Now it happened one day at Kirkwall, that earl Rognvald had a Thing with
the freemen, and when men were at the Thing, it was seen how nine armed
men came from Scapa-neck to the Thing.  And when they came to the Thing,
there they knew Sweyn Asleif’s son, and men were eager to know what
tidings he had to tell.  Sweyn had sailed in his ship from the south to
Scapa-neck, and there left his ship, but he and his men walked to
Kirkwall afterwards.  And so when they came on the place of meeting,
then his friends and kinsfolk flocked round him, and asked him what
news, but he answered little, and bade them call the bishop to him.  But
the bishop greeted Sweyn well, for they had long been friends.  They two
went aside to talk, and Sweyn tells the bishop all the truth about his
doings, and bade him now take counsel with him about these knotty
points.  The bishop said:  “These are mickle tidings that thou tellest
Sweyn, and it is more than likely that we two shall not be able to
settle this matter by ourselves;  and now my will is that thou bidest
for me here, but I will go and back thy suit before all the people and
earl Rognvald.”  Then the bishop goes to the meeting, and craves for a
hearing, and when he got it, then the bishop pleads Sweyn’s cause, and
said for what cause he had fared away from the Orkneys, and what
penalties earl Paul had laid on him for the slaying of Sweyn breastrope,
that worst of men.  Then the bishop begged of earl Rognvald for peace on
Sweyn'’ part, and he begs it too of all the people.  Then earl Rognvald
answers:  “I give my word that Sweyn shall have peace from me for three
nights, but methinks, bishop, thou bearest that look beneath thy brow,
as though ye two, Sweyn and thou, will be able to tell us of some great
tidings which have not yet come out.  My will is that thou takest Sweyn
into thy keeping and be answerable for him, but I will have a talk with
him on the morrow."” "Yes, yes,” said the bishop, “willingly will he
talk with you, and that as soon as may be, and he will become thy man if
ye will take to him.”  The earl answers:  “Methinks there are not over
many friends of mine in this land, but still we must talk more together
ere I agree to that.”  After that those four went aside to talk, earl
Rognvald, Kol his father, the bishop, and Sweyn Asleif’s son;  then
Sweyn tells them the lieve and the loath (14) of all that had passed
between him and earl Paul;  but they took that counsel to let most of
the crowd of men fare away from the Thing.  The earl stands up the
morning after, and gave the men then leave to go home.  But when the
crowd of men broke up from the Thing, then he fetched this man and that
man by himself to come and talk with them, and made all men first
promise Sweyn peace who were by before he told the tidings.  But the
morning after Hacon churl, brother of earl Magnus the saint, was got to
go and tell Sigurd of Westness and his sons of what had befallen the
earl, and this too that he was not to be looked for to take up his rule,
and that he was maimed.  Sigurd says:  “This methinks is great tidings
about the earl’s going away, but that methinks is heaviest of all that
he is maimed, for there is no place whither he could have gone that I
would not fare to find him out if he were hale.”  And so he had said to
his friends afterwards, that Hacon should not have gone away unmaimed if
he had had force enough when he \[Hacon\] told him this story, he took
it so much to heart.

But after these tidings, all men in the Orkneys went over into earl
Rognvald’s hands, and now he became sole chief over that realm which
earl Paul had owned.  And not long after the ground plan was marked out
for Magnus’ church, and builders were gathered for it;  and the work
went on so fast in three years, that less was done in four or five
thenceforth.  Kol was the man who looked most after the workmanship of
the building, and had most of the guidance as to the plan.  But as the
building went on, it grew costly to the earl, and his money was far
spent.  Then the earl sought for counsel to his father.  But Kol gave
him that advice that the earl should bring in a law to the effect that
the earls had taken all freehold lands in inheritance after men, but
that the heirs had to redeem them for their own, and that was thought
rather hard.  Then earl Rognvald made them call together a Thing, and
offered the freemen the choice of buying their freeholds out and out, so
that there was no need to redeem them.  And that they agreed on among
themselves, so that all were well pleased.  But a mark was to be paid to
the earl for every plough-land over all the isles.  But thenceforth
money was not lacking for the church building, and that building is
wrought with much toil and pains.

81.        When earl Rognvald had ruled two winters over the Orkneys,
then he kept the Yule feast at one of his farms which is called
Knarstead.  It was the sixth Yule day, that a ship was seen faring from
the south from the Pentland firth.  The weather was good, and the earl
stood out of doors, and many men by him, and looked and thought what
that ship might be.  That man was there whose name was Hrolf, and he was
the earl’s body-priest.  And when these men came to land, then they went
up from their ship, and the earl’s men kept count of them and reckoned
that they might be fifteen or sixteen men.  But at the head of the band
walked a man in a blue cape, and he had tucked his hair under the hood; 
he had shaven the beard from his chin in front, but his jaws and cheeks
were unshaven, and there (the hair) hung down full and long.  This man
seemed rather strange to them (the earl’s men), but Hrolf the Priest
knew that man, and says that that was bishop John who had come down from
Scotland out of Athole.  Then the earl went to meet them, and gives the
bishop a hearty welcome.  The earl seated the bishop on his own
high-seat, but waits himself at the board before him like a page.  Next
morning the bishop held mass early, and then he fared north to Egil’s
isle to see bishop William, and was there till the tenth Yule day.  Then
both the bishops fared to see earl Rognvald with a worthy following, and
brought out their errand.  They tell him of that agreement between
Sweyn’s Asleif’s son and earl Maddad, that their son Harold should fare
out into the Orkneys to be fostered by earl Rognvald, with this
understanding that Harold should bear the title of earl, and have half
the Orkneys with earl Rognvald, but they should both have one court, and
that earl Rognvald should rule for both of them, and do so though Harold
grew to be a man;  and if each had a will of his own, then earl Rognvald
was to have his way.  Sweyn was there too, and brought this matter
forward along with the bishop.  So earl Rognvald and his friends took
this counsel, that a meeting was fixed for the spring at Lent in
Caithness, and then an agreement was made on those terms, and was bound
by the oaths of the best men of the Orkneys and of Scotland.  Then
Harold Maddad’s son fared out into the Orkneys with earl Rognvald, and
there and then the title of earl was given him.  Then Thorbjorn clerk
fared unto the isles with earl Harold;  he was a son of Thorstein the
freeman and Gudrun Frakok’s daughter;  he was a wise man and of great
weight;  he then fostered earl Harold, and had great power over him. 
Thorbjorn took to himself a wife in the Orkneys, and got Ingirid (1)
Olaf’s daughter, Sweyn Asleif son’s sister.  Thorbjorn was then by turns
either out there in the Orkneys or up in Scotland, and he was the
boldest of men, and the most unfair overbearing man in most things. 
Sweyn Asleif's son took under him all those estates which his father
Olaf and his brother Waltheof had owned;  he then became a mighty chief,
and always had a great company of men with him.  He was a wise man and
foresighted (2) about many things;  an unfair overbearing man, and
reckless towards others.  There were not at that time those two men west
across the sea, who were not of greater birth, who were thought of more
power and weight than those brothers-in-law Sweyn and Thorbjorn.  There
was then between them great love.

82.       It fell out once that Sweyn Asleif’s son came to talk with
earl Rognvald, and asked that he would give him strength of men and
ships to avenge on Oliver and Frakok the burning of his father Olaf. 
The earl spoke and said:  “Do not think, Sweyn, that either of us need
now look for harm at the hands of either Oliver or Frakok, a carline,
who is fit for nothing.”  Sweyn answers:  “There will always be harm at
their hands so long as they live;  and I must say I then looked for
other things when I did my utmost for thy sake, than that thou shouldest
not grant me such things \[as I now ask\].”  The earl answers:  “What
help then shall I give thee which will please thee?”  Sweyn answers: 
“Two ships well fitted and manned.”  The earl said it should be as he
asked.  And after that Sweyn busked him for that voyage, and when he was
“boun” he sailed south to Broadfirth, and took the north-west wind to
Dufeyra. (3)  That is a market town in Scotland.  But thence he sailed
into the land along the shore of Murray and to Ekkjalsbakka.  Thence he
fared next of all to Athole to earl Maddad and lay at the place called
Elgin.  Then he \[the earl\] gave Sweyn guides, who knew the paths over
fells and wastes, whither he wished to go.  Thence he fared the upper
way over fells and wood, above all places where men dwelt, and came out
in Helmsdale, near the middle of Sutherland.  But Oliver and his men had
spies out everywhere where they thought that strife was to be looked for
from the Orkneys, but on this way they did not at all look for
warriors.  So they were not ware of the host before Sweyn and his men
had come to a slope at the back of Frakok’s homestead.  There came
against them Oliver the unruly with sixty men;  then they fell to battle
at once, and there was a short struggle.  Oliver and his men gave way
towards the homestead, for they could not get to the wood.  Then there
was a great slaughter of men, but Oliver he fled away up to Helmsdale
water, and swam across the river and so up on to the fell, and thence he
fared to Scotland’s firth, and so out to the Southern isles.  And he is
out of the story.  But when Oliver drew off, Sweyn and his men fared
straight up to the house and plundered it of everything, but after that
they burnt the homestead, and all those men and women who were inside
it.  And there Frakok lost her life.  Sweyn and his men did there the
greatest harm in Sutherland ere they fared to their ships.  After that
they lay out that summer, and harried round Scotland.  Sweyn came home
at autumn to the Orkneys to see earl Rognvald;  and he gave Sweyn a
hearty welcome;  then Sweyn fared across to the Ness to Duncansby, and
sat there that winter.  At that time came a message by word of mouth to
Sweyn from Holdbodi out of the Southern isles, that Sweyn should come to
help him, for thither to Tyree had come a Freeman from Wales, and had
chased Holdbodi out of house and home, and had robbed him of much
goods.  That man was called Robert who was sent, English by kin.  Sweyn
bestirred himself at once when the message was sent to him, and came out
into the Orkneys to meet earl Rognvald, and begged earl Rognvald that he
would give him force and ships.  The earl asked what Sweyn wanted to
take in hand.  He said that man had sent him word, to whom of all others
he ought to be the last to say “nay,” and who had stood him then in best
stead, when he had most need when almost every one turned against him. 
The earl answers:  “It were well then if ye two parted friends, but most
South-islanders are untrue;  but thou wilt be able to show thy
manliness, and I will give thee two ships thoroughly manned.”  This
pleases Sweyn well, and they fared then to the Southern isles, and he
did not find Holdbodi before he got as far west as Man, for he
\[Holdbodi\] had fled away thither.  But when Sweyn came to Man, then
Holdbodi was fain to see him.  And there in Man that Freeman from Wales
had done great harm in plunderings and manslayings, and so wide about in
the Southern-isles.  Before him had fallen a man of birth and worth,
whose name was Andrew;  he left behind him a wife whose name was
Ingirid, and a son whose name was Sigmund angle.  Ingirid the housewife
had much goods and a great homestead.  Holdbodi gave Sweyn that advice
to ask for her hand, but when that question was put to her, then she
said that Sweyn must do that deed for his match, to avenge her husband
Andrew.  Sweyn answers that he might do the Welshmen some harm, “but I
cannot tell how it will be fated as to loss of life.”  And after that
those two, Sweyn and Holdbodi, went on warfare and had five ships.  They
harried round Wales, and went up on land at the place called Earlsness,
and did there great mischief.  It was one morning that they went up into
a certain thorpe, and there was but a little struggle.  The householders
fled out of the thorpe, but Sweyn and his men plundered it of
everything, and burnt six homesteads before their breakfast.  There was
then with Sweyn a man from Iceland, whose name was Eric, and he sang
this stave:  “Farms are in flames, But farmers are robbed;  So hath
Sweyn willed it, Six in one morning:  Wild work enough too  He wrought
there to one man, Letting the leaseholder Livecoal on lease."  After
that they fared to their ship, and lay out that summer and got much
war-spoil, but the Freeman ran away to that isle which is called Lund.
(4)  There was a good stronghold;  Sweyn and Holdbodi sat before it for
some time, and could do nothing.  And they fared home in the autumn to
Man.

83.       That winter Sweyn made his wedding-feast with Ingirid, and
then sat there in great honour.  Next spring he gathered men to him, and
fared to see Holdbodi, and asked him for force of men, but he begged
off, and said the men were many of them at work, but some were on
trading voyages, and Sweyn got nothing of what he asked.  But there was
proof plain that the Freeman and Holdbodi had come to terms by stealth,
and bound their bargain by gifts.  But Sweyn fared away nevertheless,
and had then three ships, and they got little spoil in goods at the
beginning of the summer.  But as time went on they fared south under
Ireland, and took there a bark which the monks of the Scilly Isles owned
and plundered it.  He harried also far and wide on Ireland, and took
there much goods, and they fared home at autumn to Man, and had a great
force.  Sweyn Asleif’s son had sat there at home but a scant time, when
he heard this rumour that Holdbodi would not be true to him but Sweyn
would not hear of such a thing.  And one night about winter those
tidings happened, that Sweyn’s watchmen came and said that strife was
coming upon them.  Sweyn and his men ran to their weapons and out of
doors.  They saw where men were coming with fire to the homestead, and
they had a great band.  Then Sweyn and his men sprung up on a hillock
and defended themselves thence;  they had horns and blew them.  But that
place is thickly peopled, and men flocked to help Sweyn and his band, so
that the end of it was, that those who had come against them fell off. 
Sweyn and his men followed them up and chased them.  There many men fell
in the flight, but a crowd were wounded on either side ere they parted. 
But Holdbodi was the leader of this band, and he had taken himself off
in the flight.  He fared away till he came to Lundy;  the Freeman gave
him a hearty welcome, and they held together.  Sweyn fared home, and had
many men with him and kept good watch and ward, for he put little faith
in the South-islanders.  When the stores of Sweyn and his men began to
fail, the folk quarrelled with him;  and he sold his lands when the
winter went on for money and goods, and fared early in the spring from
the South to the Lewes, and stayed there a long time.  He had done much
mischief in this voyage.

84.       When Sweyn was in the Southern isles, earl Rognvald had fared
to Caithness, and went to a feast at Wick with that man whose name was
Hroald, his wife’s name was Arnljot.  Sweyn was the name of their son,
and he was the briskest of men.  But when the earl was at the feast,
Thorbjorn clerk and his men came down from Scotland, and told these
tidings that Thorstein the freeman his father was slain, and that a
Scottish earl had slain him, but that earl’s name was Waltheof.  But men
made that a matter of talk what a deal earl Rognvald and Thorbjorn had
to say to one another, for the earl could scarce finish the business he
had in hand for their talk.  Thorbjorn fared thence out into the isles
with the earl, but Sweyn Hroald’s son then became the earl’s
waiting-man.  Thorbjorn had then been for a while in Scotland;  he had
let two men be slain who had been at the burning of Frakok with Sweyn
Asleif’s son.  But when Sweyn came out of the Southern isles, then he
fared home to Gairsay to his house, but he did not go to see earl
Rognvald as he was wont when he came off warfare.  But when the earl
heard that he was come home, he asked Thorbjorn if he thought he knew
why it was that Sweyn would not come to see him.  Thorbjorn answers: 
“This I guess, that Sweyn mislikes me, for that I let those men be slain
who were with him at the burning of Frakok.”  The earl said:  “I will
not that ye two be at strife.”  And after that earl Rognvald fared to
Gairsay, and tried to bring about an atonement between them, and that
was easy, for they both were willing that the earl should settle the
matter.  After that he made them good friends for that time, and that
settlement was kept a long time after.

85.       In that time a vessel from Iceland came to the Orkneys, and
that man was on board whose name was Hall, son of Thorarin
broad-paunch;  he fared to live and lodge in Rinansey with Ragna and her
son Thorstein.  He was ill at ease there, and begged Thorstein that he
would take him to earl Rognvald.  They fared to find him, but the earl
would not take him into his service;  but when they came home, then
Ragna asks how they had fared.  Then Hall sang a song:  “I sent thy son
on an errand, Ragna,  Man to man speaks words of truth;  This his
weighty calling was Place at court for me to ask;  But the prince, of
rings the waster, He who rules with glory highest, Says he has warriors
enough;  Said ‘No’ to neighbour of the brawn.”  A little after Ragna
fared to see earl Rognvald on some errand of her own.  She was so “boun”
that she had a red cap on her head made of horsehair.  And when the earl
saw that, he sang:  “Never have I heard that ladies, All of them if
highly born, Wimples wore upon their heads;  Soft-tongued grows not
rings’ assassin; (5) But now Ragna, gold-lands’ fury, (6) Binds a mare’s
tail round her brow;  She a bride in gay attire Goes to meet the
wound-goose feeder.” (7)  Ragna said:  “Now it comes to that which is
often said that no man is so wise as to see everything as it is, for
this is of a horse and not of a mare.”  She took then a silken cloth,
and threw it over her head as a wimple, and still went on talking of her
affairs.  The earl was rather slow in listening to her at first, but
afterwards softened down his speech as she went on, and she got her
business settled as she wished, and leave for Hall to live at the earl’s
court.  And he was there long afterwards with earl Rognvald.  They made
both of them together the old Key to Verse-making, and let there be five
strophes in each metre, but then the song seemed too long, and now two
strophes are sung in each metre.

86.       It is said that Sweyn Asleif’s son heard how Holdbodi was come
into the Southern isles, then he begged Earl Rognvald to give him
strength to avenge himself.  The earl gave him five ships, and Thorbjorn
clerk steered one of them, but Haflidi son of Thorkell flayer the
second, Duffnjal son of Havard Gunni’s son the third, Richard Thorleif’s
son the fourth, Sweyn Asleif’s son the fifth.  But as soon as ever
Holdbodi heard of Sweyn, then he fled back south to Lundy;  and his
fellows took him to them.  Sweyn and his companions slew many men in the
Southern isles, but plundered and burnt far and wide.  They got much
goods, but they could not get at Holdbodi, and he never came back to the
Southern isles afterwards.  Sweyn wanted to be in the Southern isles
that winter, but Thorbjorn and the rest wished to go home, and so late
in the autumn they fared from the south to Caithness, and came to
Duncansby.  And when they were to share their war-spoil, then Sweyn said
that all should have an even share, save himself, who was to have a
chief’s share, for he said he alone had led them, and said the earl had
given them to him as help.  He said too he was the only one who had any
quarrel with the South-islanders, but they had none.  But Thorbjorn
thought he had not done a bit less work, and been not a whit less a
leader than Sweyn.  They wished also that all the ship-captains should
have an even share.  But the end of it was that Sweyn had his way, for
he had many more men to back him there on the Ness.  But Thorbjorn fared
out to the Orkneys to find earl Rognvald, and told him how things had
gone between them and Sweyn, and how ill pleased they were that he had
robbed them of their shares.  The earl said it would not be the only
time that Sweyn would be found to be no fair man in his dealings, “but
still the day will come when he will take his pay for his wrong-doings. 
But ye shall not strive with him about this.  I will give you as much
out of my goods as ye lose by him;  my will also is that ye make no
claim against him for this, and it will be well if greater difficulties
do not flow from him;  though I fear that we shall not have long to wait
for this.”  Thorbjorn answers:  “God thank you, lord, for this honour
which ye do to us, and we will not strive with Sweyn about this, but
never hereafter will I be his friend, and I will do him some dishonour
instead of this.”  And after that Thorbjorn declares himself parted from
Ingirid Sweyn’s sister, and sent her over to the Ness to Sweyn.  He gave
her a hearty welcome, but thought great shame had been done to him. 
Then there was feud between them, and it came to what the saw says, “Set
a thief to catch a thief.”  But still neither now plotted openly against
the other.

When Sweyn was in the Souther-isles, he had set Margad Grim’s son in
Duncansby to govern it, and given into his hand that charge (8) which he
held of earl Rognvald.  But Margad was quibbling and quarrelsome, and he
became hated for his unfairness.  But those who were most sufferers by
his unfairness ran off to find master Hroald and kept themselves there
with him.  From that a feud arose between Hroald and Margad.  A little
after Sweyn had come home Margad fared south to Wick with nineteen men
on some business of his own.  And ere he came from the south he made an
onslaught on master Hroald’s house and slew him and some men more. 
After that they fared to Duncansby to find Sweyn.  Then Sweyn gathers
men and fares to Lambburg, and got the place ready.  There was a good
stronghold, and there he sat with sixty men, and flitted thither for
himself food and other stores, which they needed to have.  The burg
stood on some sea-crags, but at the top on the land side there was a
stone wall well built.  The rocks went far along the sea the other way. 
They did there much mischief in Caithness in robberies, and flitted
thither their spoil into the burg, and they became much hated.

87.        These tidings came to the ears of earl Rognvald and Sweyn
Hroald’s son;  Sweyn begged the earl for help that he might set this
matter straight;  many men backed this prayer with Sweyn.  So it came
about that earl Rognvald bestirred himself and fared over to the Ness,
and these chiefs with him;  Thorbjorn, Haflidi Thorkel’s son, Duffnjal
Havard’s son, and Richard, and they were the worst in their counsel
against Sweyn.  They fared to Duncansby, and Sweyn was then away.  It
was said that he had fared south to Wick, and they fared thither.  But
when they came there they heard that Sweyn was in Lambburg.  Then the
earl and his men fared thither.  And when they came to the burg, then
Sweyn asks who ruled over the band.  He was told that Earl Rognvald
ruled over it.  Sweyn greeted him well and asked the earl after his
errand.  The earl answers that he wills that he should hand over Margad
into their power.  Sweyn asks whether he shall have peace.  The earl
said he would not promise that.  Then Sweyn said:  “I cannot find it in
my heart to give Margad up to the power of Sweyn Hroald’s son and his
band, or any other of my foes, those I mean who are with you, but
willingly would I be atoned with you, lord.”  Then Thorbjorn clerk
answers:  “Hear now what the lord’s traitor says, that he will willingly
be atoned;  but he has already robbed his land, and lain out like a
thief.  Ill repayest thou the earl the many honours which he has done to
thee, as thou wilt \[repay\] all those over whom thou mayest be able to
come.”  Sweyn answers:  “Thou hast no need Thorbjorn, to throw in so
much talk here, for it will not be done after thy words.  But that is my
foreboding that thou wilt repay him in the worst way the honour that he
has done thee ere ye two part, for that none will ever reap luck from
thee who have aught to do with thee.”  Then earl Rognvald bade that men
should not rail at one another.  After that they sat themselves down
round the burg, and forbade all ingoings of food, and so it went on for
a long time that they could do nothing in the way of attack.  And when
their food was wellnigh spent, then Sweyn called his men together and
sought counsel of them, but all men spoke with one mouth that they would
have his guidance and foresight while they had the choice of it.  Then
Sweyn took to words, and said:  “It seems to me most unworthy to starve
here, but after all to fall into the power of one’s foes.  And this too
has gone, as was likely, \[and proves\] that we lack both wit and luck
when matched with earl Rognvald.  And here now it was tried to bring
about peace and atonement, but neither could be got for Margad my
companion;  but though I know that all other men here will have a choice
of peace, yet I cannot find it in my heart to hand him over \[to fall\]
under the axe.  Now it is not right that so many should pay for his
perplexity, though I dare not part from him even yet.”  And after this
Sweyn took that counsel to knit together those ropes that they had.  But
at night then they let Sweyn and Margad slip down out of the burg into
the sea.  And after that they took to swimming, and struck out along the
rocks till the cliffs broke off.  After that they stepped on land, and
fared up into Sutherland, and so to Murray, and thence to Dufeyri. 
There they found some Orkneymen in a ship of burden;  the man’s name was
Hallvard who was their chief, but the second’s name was Thorkell;  they
were ten in all.  Sweyn and Margad went on board ship with them, and
they twelve together fared in the ship of burden south off Scotland till
they came to the isle of May.  There was then a monastery.  Baldwin was
the abbot’s name who ruled over it.  There Sweyn and his men were seven
nights weather-bound, and said that they were sent to find the Scot-king
from earl Rognvald.  The monks doubted their story, and thought they
were robbers, and sent to the land for men.  But when Sweyn and his men
were ware of that, then they sprang on shipboard and plundered the place
of much goods.  They fared away and in up Murkfirth. (9)  They found in
Edinburgh David the Scot-king;  he gave Sweyn a hearty welcome, and bade
them stay with him.  Sweyn told the king the whole story of his coming
thither, and how things had gone between him and earl Rognvald ere they
parted, and so also that they had robbed in the isle of May.  Sweyn and
his men were there for a while with the Scot-king in good cheer.  King
David sent men to those men who had lost goods at Sweyn’s hands in his
voyage, and let them put their own worth on their scathe, but made good
with his own money to each his loss.  King David offered Sweyn to send
and fetch his wife from the Orkneys, but to give him such honour in
Scotland as he might well be pleased with.  Sweyn laid bare his will
before the king, and spoke thus that his wish was that Margad should be
there behind with the king, but that he should send word to earl
Rognvald that he should take an atonement at his hand, but Sweyn says
that he was ready to lay all his suit in earl Rognvald’s power;  he said
he would ever be well-pleased if they were good friends, but ill-pleased
if they were foes.  King David answers:  “It is now clear both that this
earl must be worthy, and besides that ye think that only worth having
which looks towards him;  for now thou riskest all on his good faith,
but givest up that which we offer thee.”  Sweyn says he will never give
up his friendship, but still says that he must beg the king to grant him
this.  The king said so it should be.  King David sent men north into
the Orkneys with gifts, and this message, that the earl should take
atonement from Sweyn.  Then Sweyn too fared north into the isles, but
Margad stayed behind with the king.  King David’s messengers fared to
find earl Rognvald.  He gave them a hearty welcome, took the gifts too
which the king sent him, and gave his word as to the atonement.  He took
Sweyn after that into his peace and full friendship, and then he
\[Sweyn\] fared back to his house.

88.       When Sweyn and Margad were away out of Lambburg, those who
were in the burg took that counsel to give up the place into earl
Rognvald’s power.  He asked what was the last they knew of Sweyn and
Margad;  but they told him all about it.  And when the earl heard that,
he said:  “Sooth it is to say that no man is Sweyn’s match of all those
men of whom we have a choice here with us;  such deeds are both manly
and hardy.  But I will not be a dastard towards you, though ye have been
woven up in this difficulty with Sweyn;  each of you shall fare away in
peace from before me.”  The earl fared home thence to the Orkneys, but
sent Thorbjorn clerk with forty men on board a ship south to Broadfirth
to look after Sweyn and Margad, and naught could be heard of him.  Then
Thorbjorn speaks out and tells them that they are going on wondrously: 
“Here we are driving along ever so far at Sweyn’s heels, but we have
heard that earl Waltheof my father’s bane-man is but a short way hence
with a small following of men.  And now if ye will fare with me against
him, then will I give you my word that I shall not behave as Sweyn, that
I should make you robbed of your share if war-spoil falls into our
hands;  for those goods which we shall get ye shall have, but allot me
that only which ye please, for methinks fame is better than fee.”  After
that they fared to where earl Waltheof was at a feast, and took the
house over their heads, and set fire to it at once.  Waltheof and his
men ran to the doors, and asked who was master of that fire.  Thorbjorn
said who he was.  Waltheof offered atonement for the slaying of
Thorstein, but Thorbjorn said there was no need to seek for a
settlement.  Waltheof and his men defended themselves well for a while. 
But when the fire pressed them hard, they sprang out, and then their
defence lasted but a short while, for they were much worn out by the
fire.  There fell earl Waltheof and thirty men with him.  There
Thorbjorn and his men got much goods, and he kept all his promise
manfully by his men;  they fared after that out to the Orkneys to find
earl Rognvald, and he showed that he was well pleased at their errand. 
Then it was quiet in the isles, and there was good peace.

In that time dwelt at Wyre, in the Orkneys, Kolbein the burly, a man
from Norway, and he was a very mighty man;  he built him a good
stone-castle there;  that was a safe stronghold.  Kolbein had to wife
Herbjorg, a sister of Hacon bairn, but their mother was Sigrid a
daughter of Herborg, Paul’s daughter.  These were their children: 
Kolbein carle, Bjarni skald, Summerled, Aslak, Frida.  They were all of
might and mark.

89.       In that time the sons of Harold Gilli ruled over Norway.  Ingi
and Sigurd were children in years.  Then liegemen were chosen as
councillors to those brothers.  Eystein was the eldest of them.  But
Ingi was lawfully begotten, and the liegemen paid most honour to him; 
he let them have their own way in everything as they chose.  In that
time these liegemen had most to do with his counsel, Ogmund and Erling,
the sons of Kyrping-Worm.  They took that counsel with king Ingi, that
he should send word to earl Rognvald, and give him a seemly bidding to
come and see him.  They said, as was true, that the earl had been a
great friend of his father, and they bade him to behave as lovingly as
he could to the earl, so that he might be more his friend than his
brothers’, whatever might arise between them.  The earl was a kinsman of
those brothers, (10) and one of their greatest friends.  But when these
words came to earl Rognvald, he listened to them quickly, and busks him
for his voyage, for he was eager to fare to Norway to see his kinsfolk
and friends.  On this voyage earl Harold begged to go for the sake of
curiosity and pastime;  he was then fourteen or fifteen years old.  And
when the earls were “boun,” they fared from the west with chapmen, and
had a proper following, and came in the spring early to Norway.  They
found king Ingi in Bergen, and king Ingi gave them a very hearty
welcome;  there earl Rognvald found many of his kinsfolk and friends; 
he stayed there very long that summer.  That summer came from abroad,
from Micklegarth, (11) Eindrid the young;  he had been there long in
\[the Emperor’s\] service;  he was able to tell them many tidings
thence, and men thought it a pastime to ask him about things that had
happened abroad out in the world.  The earl often talked with him.  And
once on a time when they were talking, then Eindrid said:  “Methinks it
is wonderful, earl, that thou wilt not fare out to Jewry, and not have
stories alone as to the tidings which are to be told thence.  That is
the fittest place for such men as thou for the sake of your skill;  thou
wilt be best honoured there when thou fallest in with men of rank.”  And
when Eindrid had said that, many others backed it with him, and egged
the earl on that he should become the leader of this voyage.  Erling
threw in many words in favour of it, and said that he would make up his
mind to join the voyage, if the earl would become their leader.  And so,
when so many men of rank and birth were eager, then the earl gave his
word to go on the voyage.  And when the earl and Erling made up their
minds to this, then many great men chose to go on this voyage.  These
liegemen:  Eindrid the young shall tell them the way, John Peter’s son,
Aslak Erlend’s son, and Gudorm Mjola-pate of Helgeland.  It was agreed
that none of them should have a larger ship than one but the earl should
have a carved or painted or gilded ship.  That should be done so that no
man might envy another for that one had fitted out his ship or his crew
better than another;  John limp-leg shall get a ship made for the earl
to sail abroad in, and take the greatest pains with it.

Earl Rognvald fared home west in the autumn, and meant to sit two
winters in his realm.  King Ingi gave the earl two long-ships, rather
small but very handsome, and made most for rowing, and they were the
fastest of all ships.  Earl Rognvald gave one ship to earl Harold;  that
was named “Arrow,” but the other was named “Help.”  In these ships the
earls held on west across the sea.  Earl Rognvald had also taken great
gifts from his friends.  It was on Tuesday evening that the earl’s put
to sea, and they sailed with a very good wind that night;  and the wind
began to get high.  Midweek-day (Wednesday) there was a mighty storm,
but on Thursday night they were ware of land.  It was then very dark. 
They saw the surf of breakers on every side about them.  They had sailed
in company up to this.  Then there was no other choice than to sail on
and dash both ships to pieces, and so they did.  There were rocks
a-head, and a little strip of foreshore, but all the rest above cliffs. 
There all the men were saved, but they lost much goods;  some of it was
thrown ashore in the night.  Earl Rognvald behaved himself then still
best of all men, as he ever did.  He was so merry, that he played with
his fingers and made verses nearly at every word.  He drew his
finger-ring off his finger with his lips and sang a song:

               “Here I hang with hammer bent

               The hanger of the falcon’s seat, (12)

               On the gallows of the hawk’s bridge (13)

               Golden ring to Odin’s draught; (14)

               Cave-dwellers of giant voice

               Me so glad your pine hath made,

               That I play now with my fingers,

               Perch of hawk that harries geese.”

And when they had got together their baggage, they fared up into the
country to look for dwellings, for they thought they knew that they must
have come to Shetland.  They found homesteads speedily, and then the men
were shared out amongst the houses of the district.  Men were fain to
see the earl where he came, and the mistress asked about his voyage. 
The earl sang a song:

               “There was a crash when ocean billow

               Crushed to pieces, Help and Arrow;

               To those wives the storm brought sorrow,

               Wild waves threatened men with scathe;

               I see this voyage of ready-witted

               Earls, will long be had in mind;

               Hard work surely had the seamen

               To withstand the watery shock.”

The housewife bore a cloak of skin to the earl instead of a cloak;  he
took it laughingly, and reached out his hands towards her and sang:

               “Here I shake a wrinkled skin-cloak,

               Strangely scanty is my dress;

               That ship-plain that stands o’er our

               Plaids and mantles rises high;

               Still perhaps attired more bravely

               From the eel-mead’s briny horse (15)

               We may go;  against the rocks

               Dashed the surf the yardarm’s steed.”

Then great fires were made for them, and they roasted themselves at the
fires.  Asa was the name of the waiting-maid.  She went out for water,
and another woman with her.  But when they came to the water Asa
stumbled into the well in the fog;  but she ran home much chilled and
spoke between her shiverings, and men could not make out what she said. 
The earl says he knows her tongue, and sang:

               “Be quiet, now, alas!  but Asa

               Atatata! in water lieth;

               Hutututu!  where by the fire

               Shall I sit?  I’m very cold.”

The earl sends twelve of his men to Einar in Gullberwick, but he said he
would not take them in unless the earl came himself.  And when earl
Rognvald hears that, then he sang:

               “Einar says that he will nourish

               None of Rognvald’s trusty men

               Save the earl himself;  now Odin’s

               Ocean(16) rises in my throat;

               Well I know the stout of heart

               Ne’er yet broke his word to men;

               Late at even in I went

               Where the fires brightly blazed.”

This even happened one day south in Dynröstvoe in Shetland, that an old
and poor householder waited long for his mate, but all the boats rowed
out, each as it was manned.  Then came a man to the old householder in a
white cowl;  and asked why he did not row out a-fishing like other men. 
The householder says that his mate was not come.  “Master,” says the
cowl-man wilt “thou that I row with thee?”  “That I will” says the
householder, “but still I must have the lot which falls to my boat;  for
I have many bairns at home, and I work for them as well as I can.” 
After that they rowed out off Dynrösthead and inside the Hundholms. 
There was a strong current there where they lay and great eddies;  they
had to lie in the eddy and fish in the race.  The cowl-man sat in the
bow and paddled against the tide;  but the householder was to fish.  The
householder bade him mind that they were not borne into the race;  for
then he said they would run great risks.  The cowl-man did not behave as
he bade him, and cared not though the householder came into a little
danger.  A little after they were borne into the race, and the
householder was very scared and said “Wretch that I was for my ill-luck
when I took you today to row;  for here I must die;  but my folk at home
have no one to help them, and will all come to beggary if I am lost.” 
And the householder was so afraid that he wept, and he dreaded that his
death was nigh.  The cowl-man answers, “Be cheerful master, and do not
weep;  for he will pull us two out of the race who let us fall into
it.”  After that the cowl-man rowed out of the race, and the householder
was very glad at that.  Then they rowed to land, and put up the boat. 
And the householder bade the cowl-man to go with him and share the
fish.  But the cowl-man told the householder to share them as he liked; 
he says he will not have more than his third.  There was much folk come
down to the strand, both men and women, and many needy folk.  The
cowl-man gave the poor all the fish which had fallen to his lot that
day;  and then he made ready to go away.  There was a steep slope to
walk up, and many woman sat on the slope.  But as he went up the slope
his foot slipped, for it was slippery after rain, and he fell down from
the slope.  A woman was the first to see that and laughed loud at him,
and after her other folk.  But when the cowl-man heard that he sang:

               “The nymph of silk with eyes of fire,

               Louder laughs the lovely may,

               Than she aught at my array:

               Few can tell an earl indeed,

               Thus disguised in fisher’s weed,

               Yet through billows danger scorning,

               I drew the boat this early morning.”

After that the cowl-man went away;  and men became aware later that this
cowl-man had been earl Rognvald.  It became also known afterwards to
many men that there had been many such feats of his which were both
helpful in the sight of God, and pleasant in the eyes of men.  Men
reckoned (to him) also as a proverb what stood in the verse that “Few
can tell an earl in fisher’s weeds.”

The earl stayed very long in Shetland, and fared in the autumn south to
the Orkneys, and sat in his realm.  That autumn two Iceland men came to
him, the one’s name was Armod, and he was a skald;  the other’s Oddi the
little Glum’s son, a man from Broadfirth, and he too made good verses. 
The earl took to them both and gave them board and lodging in his
train.  The earl had a great Yule feast, and bade men to it and gave
gifts.  He reached out a spear inlaid with gold to Armod skald, and
shook it as he did that, and bade him make a song in return.  \[Armod
sang\]:

               “The best of chiefs, of Odin’s storm

               The rouser, does not trust his gifts

               To other men to bring to me,

               The poet who will sound his praise;

               The noble warder of the land,

               The first of kings, to Armod bore

               This best blood-taper (17) bright with gold,

               And placed the weapon in his hand.”

It fell out one day about Yule that men were looking at the hangings; 
then the earl said to Oddi the little:  “Make thou a song about the
behaviour of that man who is there on the hanging, and have thou thy
song sung when I have ended my song;  and mind and have none of those
words in thy song that I have in my song.”  The earl sang:

               “The ring lord of the falcon’s seat

               Who, old in years, stands on the hanging

               Down from his shoulder by his side;

               Bandy-legs will not move forward,

               Through the grove of Ocean’s brightness

               Waxes wrath with him who loves

               The icicle of battle-hour.”

Oddi sang:

               “Sword-god here with stooping shoulders

               Stands, and thinks to hew with sword

               His rival in a woman’s love

               At the door of yonder tent;

               He will do the men a mischief

               With his sword;  and now ‘tis time

               For the loaders of the sea-skates

               To make friends ere wounds are given.”

It happened one day that a mad man got loose from his bonds, and rushed
at earl Rognvald;  and clutched him so fast that the earl all but
tottered to his fall.  Then the earl sang a song:

               “At the mantle of the monarch

               The sturdy beggar caught and clutched,

               The carle was on the eve of hurling

               Hard to earth the liberal lord;

               Still the tree of steel stood upright,

               Though men said they saw him stagger;

               Might enow the sword-edge scatterer

               Careful keeps to hold his own.”

The earl had also bishop William at his feast that Yule, and many of his
chieftains.  Then he laid bare his plans how he meant to go away from
the land and out to Jewry;  he begged the bishop to go with him on his
voyage.  The bishop was a Paris clerk, and the earl wished above all
things that he should be their spokesman.  The bishop promised to go
with him.

90.       These men made ready to go with earl Rognvald:  Magnus, son of
Havard Gunni’s son, and Sweyn Hroald’s son.  They were captains of ships
both of them.  These fared of the lesser men, so far as they are named: 
Thorgeir Scotpoll, Oddi the little, Thorbjorn the swarthy, and Armod. 
These were the earl's skalds.  Then there were also these men:  Thorkell
crook-eye, and Grimkel of Glettness, and Blian, son of Thorstein of
Flydruness. --- And when those two winters were spent which they were to
have to get ready, earl Rognvald fared out of the Orkneys east to Norway
early in the spring, and wished to know how those liegemen got on with
their outfit.  And when the earl came to Bergen, he found there Erling
wryneck and John limp-leg the earl’s brother-in-law.  There too had come
Aslak, but Gudorm came a little after.  There too was that ship off the
wharf which John had got made for the earl;  it had five-and-thirty
seats for rowers, and was a very careful piece of work, and the
figure-head and taffrail and weather-vanes were all overlaid with gold,
and she was carved and painted in many other places;  the ship was the
greatest treasure of her kind.  Eindrid came also from time to time to
the town that summer, and always says that he would be boun the week
after;  but men were ill-pleased when they had to wait so long.  Some
wished that he should not be waited for, and said that men had sailed on
such voyages before though Eindrid were not with them.  And a little
while after Eindrid came to the town and gave out that he was then boun,
and then the earl bade him set sail as soon as ever he thought he was
like to get a fair wind.  And when that day came that they thought they
had a good chance, they pulled out of the town and took to their sails. 
The wind was rather light, and the earl’s ship made little way, for she
needed a good breeze.  The other chiefs slackened sail, and would not
sail away from the earl.  But as they drew away from among the isles,
the wind began to get sharp, and then it grew so high that they had to
reef sail on board the smaller ships, but the earl’s ship began to walk
fast.  Then they saw two big ships sailing after them and at once by and
beyond them.  One of those ships was a work of much pains, it was a
drake;  both the head forward and the coils aft were much gilded.  It
was gay and gaudy, and painted all above the water-line wherever it
seemed to look well.  The earl’s men said that there must Eindrid be
sailing, “and he has kept little to that which was laid down, that no
one should have a carved or gilded ship but thou, lord.”  The earl
says:  “Great is Eindrid’s pride.  But now there is this excuse for his
refusing to be equal with us that we have been so far wrong in our
opinion as to him;  but it is hard to see whether luck goes before him
or after him;  we will not shape our course after his haste.”  Then
Eindrid bore speedily away from them in that big ship, but the earl kept
in company with his ships, and they had a good passage.  They came about
autumn to the Orkneys safe and sound.  Then it was thought best that
they should sit there that winter;  some sat at their own cost, but some
were with the householders, and many with the earl. --- In the isles
there was great stir that winter, and the Easterlings and the
Orkneyingers fell asunder about bargains and love-matters, and many
quarrels sprang up.  The earl took great pains to keep watch on those on
both sides who thought they wre bound to repay him for all the good he
had done them, and that they were worthy of all good from him. --- Of
Eindrid and his messmates that is to be told that they came to
Shetland;  and he dashed there that good ship to splinters and lost much
goods, but the lesser ship was saved.  Eindrid was that winter in
Shetland, and sent men east to Norway to let them build him a ship for
his voyage abroad.

There was a man named Arni spindleshanks, a messmate of Eindrid’s;  he
fared south into the Orkneys that winter and nine of his companions with
him.  Arni was a very unfair man and bold and strong.  He and his
companions sat at his own cost in one of the isles that winter.  Arni
buys malt and cattle for slaughter from a tenant of Sweyn Asleif’s son; 
but when he asked for the price, Arni put him off.  And a second time,
when he asked for it, he was paid with threats, and ere they parted Arni
gave him a blow with the back of his axe and said this:  “Go now and
tell that champion Sweyn with whom thou art ever threatening us, and let
him set thy lot straight;  thou wilt not need more than this.”  The
husbandman went and told Sweyn and bade him set his lot straight.  Sweyn
answers shortly about it, and said he could make no promise about it. 
It was one day about spring that Sweyn fared to get in his rents;  they
were four of them in an eight-oared boat.  Their course lay by that isle
in which Arni and his men sat.  Sweyn told his men to pull in towards
the land, but there was a strong ebb tide on.  Sweyn went on shore
alone, and had his hand-axe in his hand and no other weapons.  He bade
them watch the boat so that the ebb did not leave it high and dry.  Arni
and his men sat in an outhouse a short way from the sea.  Sweyn went up
to the outhouse and into it.  Arni and five of his men were inside and
hailed Sweyn;  he took their greeting, and spoke to Arni, and told him
that he must pay up his debt to the husbandman.  Arni said there was
good time still for that.  Sweyn bade him do as he asked him, and pay up
the debt.  Arni said he would not do so for all that.  Sweyn said he
would only ask him for a little more, and with that he struck his axe
against Arni’s head, so that it went up to the back of the blade, and he
lost his hold of the axe.  Sweyn sprang out, but Arni’s messmates looked
to him, but some ran after Sweyn down into the mud.  So they ran along
the shore and one was fleetest;  Sweyn and his pursuer were then at very
close quarters.  Great sea-weed tangles lay on the shore in the mud. 
Sweyn caught up one of the tangles and dashed it into the face of him
who was nearest to him, sand and all.  This man took to rubbing his eyes
with both hands, and wiped the sand out of them.  But Sweyn got clear
off to his boat, and fared home to Gairsay to his house.  A little while
after Sweyn fared over to the Ness on an errand of his own;  he sent
word to earl Rognvald that he should take an atonement for the slaying
of Arni spindleshanks.  And as soon as these words came to him, he \[the
earl\] summoned to him all those who had the blood feud for the slaying
of Arni, and made matters up with them, so that they were pleased, and
he paid up the fine himself.  Much other mischief the earl made good
with his own money that was wrought that winter both by the Easterlings
and Orkneyingers, for they had pulled very ill together.  In the spring
very early the earl summoned a crowded Thing in Hrossey;  thither came
all the chiefs who were in his realm.  Then he made it bare to them that
he meant to go out of the land to Jewry, and says that he would give
over his realm into the hands of Harold Maddod’s son, his kinsman.  He
begged this that all would follow him like true men in whatever he might
need while he was away.  Earl Harold was then nearly a man of twenty.
(18)  He was a tall man of growth, and stout and strong, an ugly man and
wise enough, and men thought him a likely man for a chief.  Thorbjorn
clerk had then most share in ruling the land with him when earl Rognvald
first fared out of the Orkneys.

91.        Earl Rognvald busked him that summer to leave the Orkneys,
and he was rather late boun, for they had a long while to wait for
Eindrid, as his ship did not come from Norway which he had let be made
there the winter before.  But when they were boun, they held on their
course away from the Orkneys in fifteen big ships.  These were then the
ship-captains;  earl Rognvald, bishop William, Erling wry-neck, Aslak
Erlend’s son, Gudorm, Mjola-pate of Helgeland, Magnus Havard’s son,
Sweyn Hroald’s son, Eindrid the young, John Peter’s son limpleg, and
those five whose names are not told.  They were Eindrid’s men.  They
sailed away from the Orkneys, and south to Scotland, and so on to
England, and as they sailed by Northumberland, off Humbermouth, Armod
sang a song:

               “The sea was high off Humbermouth

               When our ships were beating out,

               Bends the mast and sinks the land

               ‘Neath our lee off Vesla-sand;

               Wave with veil of foam that rises

               Drives not in the eyes of him

               Who now sits at home;  the stripling

               From the meeting rideth dry.”

They sailed thence south round England and to France. (1)  Nothing is
said of their voyage before that they came to that seaburg which is
named Nerbon. (2)  There these tidings had happened, that the earl who
before had ruled the town was dead;  his name was Germanus;  he left
behind him a daughter young and fair, whose name was Ermingerd.  She
kept watch and ward over her father’s inheritance with the counsel of
the most noble men of her kinsfolk.  They gave that counsel to the queen
that she should bid the earl to a worthy feast, and said that by that
she would be famous if she welcomed heartily such men of rank who had
come so far to see her, and who would bear her fame still further.  The
queen bade them see to that.  And when this counsel had been agreed on
by them, men were sent to the earl and he was told that the queen bade
him to a feast with as many of his men as he chose to bring with him. 
The earl of his men bidding with thanks;  he chose out all his best men
for this journey with him.  And when they came to the feast, there was
the best cheer, and nothing was spared which could do the earl more
honour than he had ever met before.  One day it happened as the earl sat
at the feast that the queen came into the hall and many women with her,
she held a beaker of gold in her hand.  She was dressed in the best
clothes, had her hair loose as maidens wont to have, and had put a
golden band round her brow.  She poured the wine into the earl’s cup,
but her maidens danced before them.  The earl took her hand and the
beaker too and set her on his knee, and they talked much that day.  Then
the earl sang a song:

               “Sure it is, O lady lovely,

               That thy stature far outvies

               Form of women whose attire

               Gleams well fringed with Frodi’s meal; (3)

               Locks as soft as yellow silk,

               Lets the maiden downward fall

               On her shoulders;  I have reddened

               Eager eagles’ crooked claws.”

The earl stayed there very long in the best of cheer.  The townsmen
pressed the earl to settle down there, and spoke out loudly about how
they would give him the lady to wife.  The earl said he would fare on
that voyage which he had purposed, but said he would come thither as he
fared back, and then they could carry out their plan \[or not\] as they
pleased.  After that the earl busked him away thence with his fellow
voyagers.  And as they sailed west of Thrasness they have a good wind; 
then they sat and drank and were very merry.  Then the earl sang a song:

               “Noble youth will long remember

               Words which Ermingerda spoke;

               Brave bride wills that we should ride

               O’er Ran’s home to Jordan’s stream;

               But when back the water-horse’s

               Woods (4) fare north across the wave,

               He will cut the whale-land then

               Home to Nerbon at the fall.”

This Armod sang:

               “Unless changes my fate hard,

               I shall fair Ermingerd

               Ne’er meet again;

               Many nurseth for that noble maiden his pain;

               Were I not blessed in slumbering ---

               ‘Twere luck past all numbering ---

               One night by her side;

               The fairest of faces hath surely that bride.”

Oddi the little sang a song:

               “We are scarcely, as I ween,

               Worthy of fair Ermingerd;

               Well I know that noble crown-land

               May be called the king of queens;

               For it well befits that goddess

               Of the ringfield’s fire to find

               A better husband altogether;

               May she live blest ‘neath seat of sun.”

92.       They fared till they came west to Galicialand in the winter
before Yule, and meant to sit there Yule over.  They dealt with the
landsmen and begged them to set them a market to buy food;  for the land
was barren and bad for food;  for the land was barren and bad for food,
and the landsmen thought it hard to feed that host of men.  Now these
tidings had happened there, that in that land sat a chief, who was a
stranger, in a castle, and he had laid on the landsmen very heavy
burdens.  He harried them on the spot if they did not agree at once to
all that he asked, and he offered them the greatest tyranny and
oppression.  And when the earl spoke to the landsmen about bringing him
food to buy, they made him that offer, that they would set them up a
market thenceforth on till Lent, but they must rid them in some way or
other of the men in the castle;  but earl Rognvald was to bear the brunt
in return for the right of having all the goods that were gotten from
them.  The earl laid this bare before his men, and sought counsel from
them as to which choice he should take, but most of them were eager to
fall on the castlemen, and thought it bid fair for spoil.  And so earl
Rognvald and his host went into that agreement with the landsmen.  But
when it drew near to Yule, earl Rognvald called his men to a talk and
said:  “Now have we sat here awhile, and yet we have had nothing to do
with the castlemen, but the landsmen are getting rather slack in their
dealings with us;  methinks they think that what we promised them will
have no fulfilment;  but still that is not manly not to turn our hands
to what we have promised.  Now, kinsman Erling will I take counsel from
you in what way we shall win the castle, for I know that ye are here
some of you the greatest men for good counsel;  but still I will beg all
those men who are here that each will throw in what \[he thinks\] is
likeliest to be worth trying.”  Erling answered the earl’s speech:  “I
will not be silent at your bidding, but I am not a man for counsel;  and
it would be better rather to call on those men for that who have seen
more, and are more wont to such exploits, as is Eindrid the young.  But
here it will be as the saying goes, ‘You must shoot at a bird before you
get him.’  And so we will try to give some counsel whatever comes of
it.  We shall today, if it seems to you not bad counsel or to the other
shipmasters, go all of us to the wood, and bear each of us three
shoulder-bundles of faggots on our backs under the castle;  for it seems
to me as though the lime will not be trusty if a great fire is brought
to it.  We shall let this go on for the three next days and see what
turn things take.”  They did as Erling bade.  And when that toil was
over, it was come right on to Yule.  The bishop would not let them make
their onslaught while the Yule high feast stood over them.

That chief’s name was Godfrey who dwelt in the castle;  he was a wise
man and somewhat stricken in years.  He was a good clerk, and had fared
far and wide, and knew many tongues.  He was a grasping man and a very
unfair man.  He calls together his men when he saw their \[Rognvald’s\]
undertakings, and said to them:  “This scheme seems to me clever and
harmful to us which the Northmen have taken in hand;  it will befall us
thus if fire is borne against us, that the stone wall round the castle
will be untrusty, but the Northmen are strong and brave;  we shall have
to look for a sharp fight from them if they get a chance.  I will now
take counsel with you what shall be done in this strait which has
befallen us.”  But his men all bade him see to that for them.  Then he
began to speak, and said:  “My first counsel is that ye shall bind a
cord round me and let me slide down the castle wall tonight.  I shall
have on bad clothes and fare into the camp of the Northmen, and know
what I can find out.”  This counsel was taken as he had laid it down. 
And when Godfrey came to earl Rognvald, and said he was an old beggar
carle, and spoke in Spanish;  they understood that tongue best.  He
fared about among all the booths and begged for food.  He found out that
there was great envy and splitting into parties amongst the Northmen. 
Eindrid was the head of one side, but the earl of the other.  Godfrey
came to Eindrid and got to talk with him, and brought that before him
that the chief who held the castle had sent him thither.  “He will have
fellowship with thee, and he hopes that thou wilt give him peace if the
caste be won;  he would rather that thou shouldst have his treasures, if
thou wilt do so much in return for them, than those who would rather see
him a dead man.”  Of such things they talked and much besides.  But the
earl was kept in the dark;  all this went on by stealth at first.  And
when Godfrey had stayed a while with the earl’s men, then he turned back
to his men.  But this was why they did not flit what they owned out of
the castle, because they did not know whether the storm would take place
at all;  besides they could not trust the landfolk.

93.       It was the tenth day of Yule that earl Rognvald rose up.  The
weather was good.  Then he bade his men put on their arms, and let the
host be called up to the castle with the trumpet.  Then they drew the
wood towards it, and piled a bale (5) round about the wall;  the earl
drew up his men for the onslaught where each of them should go.  The
earl goes against it from the south with the Orkneyingers;  Erling and
Aslak from the west;  John and Gudorm from the east;  Eindrid the young
from the north, with his followers.  And when they were boun for the
storm they cast fire into the bale.  Then the earl sang:

               “Ermingerd’s white handmaid bore

               Wine to men, the goddess bright

               Of driven snow, so fair she seemed

               To my vision when we met;

               Now the warrior band resolves

               To rush onward and attack

               Castle-garrison with fire;

               Sharp-swords spring from out the sheaths.”

Now they begin to press on fast both with fire and weapons.  Then they
shot hard into the work, for they could not reach them by any other
attack.  The castlemen stood loosely here and there on the wall, for
they had to guard themselves against the shots.  They poured out too
burning pitch and brimstone, and the earl’s men took little harm by
that.  Now it turned out, as Erling had guessed, that the castle wall
crumbled before the fire when the lime would not stand it, and there
were great breaches in it.  Sigmund angle was the name of a man in the
earl’s body-guard;  he was Sweyn Asleif’s son’s stepson;  he pressed on
faster than any man to the castle, and ever went on before the earl;  he
was then scarcely grown up.  And when the storm had lasted awhile, then
all men fled from the castle wall.  The wind was on from the south, and
the reek of the smoke lay towards Eindrid and his men.  And when the
fire began to spread very fast, then the earl made them bring water, and
cool the rubble that was burned.  And then there was a lull in the
assault. (6)  Then earl Rognvald sang a song:

               “Aye shall I that Yule remember,

               Warrior!  which we spent at Agdir,

               East among the fells with Solmund,

               Steward strong of Norway’s king;

               Now again at that same season

               Of another year as then

               Stunning din of swords I make

               On the castle’s southern verge.”

And again he sang:

               “Well pleased was I when the wine-tree (7)

               Listened to my winning words;

               Past all hope then was I given

               At harvest to the foreign maid;

               Now again I sate the eagles,

               Since full well we love the girl

               Nobly born;  and now the freestone

               Set in mortar must give way.”

Then Sigmund angle sang this:

               “Bear these words back when the spring comes

               To the goddess needle-plying,

               Wearing gems from fell-side won,

               Bear them o’er the sea to Orkney;

               That no warrior, though he were

               Wight of elder years, went farther

               Forward ‘neath the castle walls,

               When strokes sung high at early morn.”

After that the earl made ready to storm, and Sigmund angle with him. 
There was then but a little struggle, and they got into the castle. 
There many men were slain, but those who would take life gave themselves
up to the earl’s power.  There they took much goods, but they did not
find the chief, and scarcely any precious things.  Then there was
forthwith much talk how Godfrey could have got away;  and then at once
they had the greatest doubt of Eindrid the young, that he must have
passed him away somehow, and that he \[Godfrey\] must have gone away
under the smoke to the wood.

After that earl Rognvald and his host stayed there a short time in
Galicialand, and held on west off Spain.  They harried wide in that part
of Spain which belonged to the heathen, and got there much goods.  They
ran up into a thorpe there, as the earl told them.  But those who dwelt
in the thorpe ran together and made ready to battle;  then there was a
hard struggle, and the landfolk fled at last, but many were slain.  Then
the earl sang a song:

               “Lady-meeting now I long for;

               Out away in Spain was driven

               Foe in speedy flight, and many

               Ring-trees (8) panting rushed before me;

               We were worthy Ermingerda,

               For that then sweet songs were chaunted

               In our praises to the people;

               Corses covered all the field.”

After that they sailed west off Spain, and got there a great storm, and
lay three days at anchor, so that they shipped very much water, and it
lay near that they had lost their ships.  Then the earl sang:

               “Cool fields goddess! (9) never shall I

               Free afraid in wintry storm

               If along the good ship’s sides

               Hemp and cable do not snap;

               To the white-hued clad in linen,

               To lady proud my word when sailing

               South I gave;  and now the wind

               To the Sound soon bears my ship.”

After that they hoisted their sails, and beat out to Njorfa Sound (10)
with a very cross wind. (11)  Then Oddi the little sang:

               “Hearty friend of men, who drinketh

               Mead in-doors, hath often spent

               Seven much more cheerful days

               With the captain of the sound-tree; (12)

               But today the high-souled Rognvald,

               With his band of shielded men,

               On his bright-hued wooden horse

               Ran for Njorvi’s narrow Sound.”

And as they were just beating into the Sound, the earl sang:

               “Eastern wind hath borne along

               Our ships at winter-tide

               Far from the French lady’s hands;

               Come, run out our boom to tack;

               We shall have to gird our sea-stag

               Half-mast high off Spain today;

               Soon to Svidrir’s stormy Sound,

               Speeds the gale our ships along.”

They sailed through Njorfa Sound, and then the weather began to get
better.  And then as they bore out of the Sound, Eindrid the younger
parted company from the earl with six ships.  He sailed over the sea to
Marseilles, but Rognvald and his ships lay behind at the Sound, and men
talked much about it, how Eindrid helped Godfrey away.  Then the earl
made them hoist their sails;  they sailed on the main, and steered a
south course along Sarkland. (13)  Then Rognvald sang a song:

               “North away the land still trends,

               Brave ship spares not now the wave,

               Nor shall now this man be slow

               To break out in burst of song;

               This soft belt of earth (14) I cut

               Off the Spanish shore today;

               With thin keel, this hateful bight

               To a lazy longshoreman.”

Nothing is told of the voyage of the earl and his men before they came
south off Sarkland, and lay in the neighbourhood of Sardinia, and knew
not what land they were near.  The weather had turned out in this wise,
that a great calm set in and mists and smooth seas --- though the nights
were light --- and they saw scarcely at all from their ships, and so
they made little way.  One morning it happened that the mist lifted. 
Men stood up and looked about them.  Then the earl asked if men saw
anything new.  They said they saw naught but two islets, little and
steep;  and when they looked for the islets the second time, then one of
the islets was gone.  They told this to the earl;  he began to say: 
“That can have been no islets, that must be ships which men have out
here in this part of the world, which they call Dromonds; (15)  those
are ships big as holms to look on.  But there where the other Dromond
lay a breeze must have come down on the sea, and they must have sailed
away, but these must be wayfaring men, either chapmen or faring in some
other way on their business.”  After that the earl lets them call to him
the bishop and all the shipmasters;  then he began to say:  “I call you
together for this, lord bishop and Erling my kinsman;  see ye any scheme
or chance of ours that we may win victory in some way over those who are
on the Dromond.”  The bishop answers:  “Hard, I guess, will it be for
you to run your longships under the Dromond, for ye will have no better
way of boarding than by grappling the bulwarks with a broad axe, but
they will have brimstone and boiling pitch to throw under your feet and
over your heads.  Ye may see, earl, so wise as ye are, that it is the
greatest rashness to lay one’s self and one’s men in such risk.”  Then
Erling began to speak:  “Lord bishop,” he says, “likely it is that ye
are best able to see this that there will be little hope of victory in
rowing against them.  But somehow it seems to me that though we try to
run under the Dromond, so methinks it will be that the greatest weight
of weapons will fall beyond our ships, if we hug her close, broadside to
broadside.  But if it be not so, then we can put off from them quickly,
for they will not chase us in the Dromond.”  The earl began to say: 
“That is spoken like a man and quite to my mind.  I will now make that
clear to the shipmasters and all the crews, that each man shall busk him
in his room, and arm himself as he best can.  After that we will row up
to them.  But if they are Christian chapmen, then it will be in our
power to make peace with them;  but if they are heathen, as I feel sure
they are, then Almighty God will yield us that mercy that we shall win
the victory over him.  But of the war-spoil which we get there, we shall
give the fiftieth penny to poor men.”  After that men got out their arms
and heightened the bulwarks of their ships, and made themselves ready
according to the means which they had at hand.  The earl settles where
each of his ships should run in.  Then they made an onslaught on her by
rowing, and pulled up to her as briskly as they could.

94.       But when those who were on board the Dromond saw that ships
were rowing up to them, and that men meant to make an onslaught on them,
they took silken stuffs and costly goods and hung them out on the
bulwarks, and then made great shoutings and hailings;  and it seemed to
the earl’s men as though they dared the Northmen to come on against
them.  Earl Rognvald laid his ship aft alongside the Dromond on the
starboard, but Erling aft too on the larboard.  John and Aslak, they
laid their ships foreward each on his own board, but the others
amidships on both boards, and all the ships hugged her close, broadside
to broadside.  And when they came under the Dromond, her sides were so
high out of the water that they could not reach up with their weapons. 
But they \[the foe\] poured down blazing brimstone and flaming pitch
over them.  And it was as Erling guessed it would be, that the greatest
weight of weapons fell out beyond the ships, and they had no need to
shield themselves on that side which was next to the Dromond, but those
who were on the other side held their shields over their heads and
sheltered themselves in that way.  And when they made no way with their
onslaught, the bishop shoved his ship off and two othes, and they picked
out and sent thither their bowmen, and they law within shot, and shot
thence at the Dromond, and then that onslaught was the hardest that was
made.  Then those \[on board the Dromond\] got under cover, but thought
little about what those were doing who had laid their ships under the
Dromond.  Earl Rognvald called out then to his men that they should take
their axes and hew asunder the broadside of the Dromond in the parts
where she was least iron-bound.  But when the men in the other ships saw
what the earls men were about, they also took the like counsel.  Now
where Erling and his men had laid their ship a great anchor hung on the
Dromond, and the fluke was hung by the crook over the bulwark, but the
stock pointed down to Erling’s ship.  Audun the red was the name of
Erling’s bowman;  he was lifted up on the anchor-stock.  But after that
he hauled up to him more men, so that they stood as thick as every they
could on the stock, and thence hewed at the sides as they best could,
and that hewing was by far the highest up.  And when they had hewn such
large doors that they could go into the Dromond, they made ready to
board, and the earl and his men got into the lower hold, but Erling and
his men into the upper.  And when both their bands had come up on the
ship, there was a fight both great and hard.  On board the Dromond were
Saracens, what we call Mahomet's unbelievers.  There were many
blackamoors, and they made the hardest struggle.  Erling got there a
great wound on his neck near his shoulders as he sprang up into the
Dromond.  That healed so ill, that he bore his head on one side ever
after.  That was why he was called wryneck.  And when they met, earl
Rognvald and Erling, the Saracens gave way before them to the forepart
of the ship, but the earl’s men then boarded her one after another. 
Then they were more numerous, and they pressed the enemy hard.  They saw
that on board the Dromond was that one man who was both taller and
fairer than the others;  the Northmen held it to be the truth that that
man must be their chief. Earl Rognvald said that they should not turn
their weapons against him, if they could take him in any other way. 
Then they hemmed him in and bore him down with their shields, and so he
was taken, and afterwards carried to the bishop’s ship, and few men with
him.  They slew there much folk, (16) and got much goods and many costly
things.  When they had ended the greatest part of their toil, they sat
down and rested themselves.  Then the earl sang this:

                        “Famous in victorious glory,

               Erling, brave in battle, went

               ‘Gainst the galleon, tree of spears, (17)

               When our banners dripped with blood;

               Low we laid the swarthy champions,

               Blood of foemen then was shed

               Far and wide, and soldiers brave

               Died their keen-edged faulchions red.”

And again he sang:

               “We make up our minds to win

               The galleon, slaughter this I call;

               At early dawn the warrior crew

               Reddened all their blades with gore;

               North and from the north the lady

               Of this shower of spears will hear

               Up to Nerbon;  from our people

               Foemen loathsome life-loss bore.”

Men spoke of these tidings which had happened there.  Then each spoke of
what he thought he had seen;  and men talked about who had been the
first to board the Dromond, and could not agree about it.  Then some
said that it was foolish that they should not all have one story about
these great tidings;  and the end of it was that they agreed that earl
Rognvald should settle the dispute;  and afterwards they should all back
what he said.  Then the earl sang:

               “First upon the gloomy galleon

               Ruddy Audun went with eager

               Daring, and the warrior dauntless

               Swift dashed on to seize the spoil;

               There at last we reached to redden

               Weapons in our foeman’s blood;

               Mankind’s God hath ruled it so;

               On the planks fell corses black.”

When they had stripped the Dromond, they put tire into her and burnt
her.  And when that tall man whom they had made captive saw that, he was
much stirred and changed colour, and could not hold himself still.  But
though they tried to make him speak, he said never a word, and made no
manner of sign, nor did he pay any heed to them whether they promised
him good or ill.  But when the Dromond began to blaze, they saw as
though blazing molten ore ran down into the sea.  That moved the captive
man much.  They were quite sure then that they had looked for goods
carelessly, and now the metal had melted in the heat of the fire,
whether it had been gold or silver.  Earl Rognvald and his men sailed
thence south under Sarkland, and lay under a sea-burg, and made a seven
nights’ truce with the townsmen, and had dealings with them, and sold
them the men whom they had taken.  No man would buy the tall man.  And
after that the earl gave him leave to go away, and four men with him. 
He came down the next morning with a train of men, and told them that he
was a prince of Sarkland, and had sailed thence with the Dromond and all
the goods that were aboard her.  He said too he thought that worst of
all that they burnt the Dromond, and made such waste of that great
wealth, that it was of no use to any one.  “But now I have great power
over your affairs.  Now ye shall have the greatest good from me for
having spared my life, and treated me with such honour as ye could;  but
I would be very willing that we saw each other never again.  And so now
live safe and sound and well.”  After that he rode up the country, but
earl Rognvald sailed thence south to Crete, and they lay there in very
foul weather.  Then Armod sang a song when he kept watch at night on
board the earl’s ship.

               “On the keel-horse we keep watch,

               Where below the stiff ribs dashes

               Wave on wave;  this weary work

               Have we here to win till morning;

               O’er my shoulder now I look

               Back on Crete, while milksop soft

               Sleeps to night with sleek-skinned maiden,

               Kind in her close-fitting smock.”

95.       The earl and his men lay under Crete till they got a fair wind
for Jewry-land, and came to Acreburg early on a Friday morning, and
landed then with such great pomp and state as was seldom seen there. 
Thorbjorn the swarthy then made a song:

               “In the Orkneys for a winter

               Was I serving with the chief;

               Feeder of the bird of battle

               First arose to strive in fight;

               Now the shield on Friday morning

               Here we bear with eager haste,

               With the earl in battle proven,

               In watery port of Acre town.”

The earl and his men stayed in Acreburg a while.  There sickness came
into their ranks, and many famous men breathed their last.  There
Thorbjorn the swarthy a liegeman breathed his last.  Oddi the little
sang:

               “Barks of chieftains

               Thorbjorn bore,

               Swarthy of hue,

               By Thrasness swift;

               Under the best of skalds

               Woodbear (18) trode

               Ati’s acres

               To Acreburg.

               Then saw I him,

               The hero’s friend,

               Sprinkled with mould

               In mother church;

               Now the soil stony,

               By sunbeam blest,

               Lies heavy o’er him

               In southern land.”

Earl Rognvald and his men then fared from Acreburg, and sought all the
holiest places in the land of Jewry.  They all fared to Jordan and
bathed there.  Earl Rognvald and Sigmund angle swam across the river,
and went up on the bank there, and thither where was a thicket of
brushwood, and there they twisted great knots.  Then the earl sang:

               “For the men a coil I twisted

               Of the way-thong on the heath,

               Out on Jordan’s further bank;

               Clever woman this will learn;

               But I trow that it will seem

               Long to go so far as this

               To all lazy stay-at-homes;

               On wide field the blood falls warm.”

Then Sigmund sang:

               “I will wreathe another knot

               For the sloth who sits at home;

               Sooth to say that we have set

               For his child a snare today.”

The earl sang:

               “To the coward here we twine

               In the thicket close a knot,

               On this feast of holy Laurence;

               Tired to quarters good I came.”

After that they fared back to Jerusalem.  And when they came close to
the city, then earl Rognvald sang:

               “At this bard’s breast hangs a cross,

               Twixt his shoulder-blades a palm;

               Pride of heart shall be laid low;

               Soldiers scale the cliffs in order.”

96.       Earl Rognvald and his men fared that summer from the land of
Jewry, and meant to go north to Micklegarth, and came about autumn to
that town which is called Imbolar. (19)  They stayed there a very long
time in the town.  They had that watchword in the town if men met one
another walking where it was throng and narrow, and the one thought it
needful that the other who met him should yield him the path, then he
says thus:  “Out of the way,” “Out of the way.”  One evening as the earl
and his men were coming out of the town, and Erling wryneck went out
along the whart to his ship, some of the townsmen met him and called
out, “Out of the way,” “Out of the way.”  Erling was very drunk, and
made as though he heard them not, and when they ran against one another,
Erling fell off the wharf, and down into the mud which was below, and
his men ran down to pick him up, and had to strip off every stitch of
his clothes, and wash him.  Next morning when he and the earl met, and
he was told what had happened, he smiled at it and sang:

               “ ‘Mid-street’ my friend would not call

               So he had in filth to fall

               Head and heels, and thus in that

               Great misfortune nearly followed;

               Then I trow the king’s own cousin

               Little comely looked when rolling

               midst the mud in Imbolar;

               To his breeks the blue clay clung.”

These tidings happened a little while after there in the town, when they
came out of the town very drunk that John limpleg’s men missed him, but
no man else.  They sent at once to look for him on board the other ships
that night, and he could not be found, but they could not look for him
upon the land in the night.  But next morning they rose up as soon as
ever it was light, and found him a little way from the burg-wall, and he
had breathed his last, and they found wounds on him.  But it was never
known who had given him his hurt.  Then they bestowed burial on his
body, and found him a grave at the church.  After that they fared away
thence.  And nothing is told of their voyage before they come north to
Engilsness \[Cape St. Angelo\].  There they lay some nights and waited
for a wind which would seem fair to them to sail north along the sea to
Micklegarth.  They took great pains then with their sailing, and so
sailed with great pomp just as they had heard that Sigurd Jewryfarer had
done.  And as they sailed north along the sea, earl Rognvald sang a
song:

              “Let us ride on Refil’s steed (20)

              Out to Micklegarth with speed;

              From the field draw not the plough,

              Ear the main with dripping prow;

              Take we bounty of the king,

              Push we on while weapons ring,

              Redden maw of wolf with gore,

              Mighty monarch bow before.”

97.        When earl Rognvald and his men came to Micklegarth, they had
a hearty welcome from the emperor and the Varangians.  Menelaus was then
emperor over Micklegarth, whom we call Manuel;  he gave the earl much
goods, and offered them bounty-money if they would stay there.  They
stayed there awhile that winter in very good cheer.  There was Eindrid
the young, and he had very great honour from the emperor.  He had little
to do with earl Rognvald and his men, and rather tried to set other men
against them.  Earl Rognvald set out on his voyage home that winter from
Micklegarth, and fared first west to Bulgaria-land to Dyrrachburg. (21) 
Thence he sailed west across the sea to Poule. (22)  There earl Rognvald
and bishop William and Erling and all the nobler men of their band
landed from their ships, and got them horses, and rode thence first to
Rome, and so homewards on the way from Rome until they come to Denmark,
and thence they fared north to Norway.  There men were glad to see them,
and this voyage was most famous, and they who had gone on it were
thought to be men of much more worth after than before.  While they had
been on their travels Ogmund the gallant, Erling wryneck’s brother had
died;  he was thought of most worth of those brothers while they were
both alive.  Erling threw in his lot at once with king Ingi, because he
leant most to him of those brothers in all friendship, and they never
parted so long as they both lived.

But after king Ingi’s fall Magnus was chosen to be king over that band,
the son of Erling and Kristina, daughter of king Sigurd Jewryfarer;  but
Erling alone had then the whole rule over the land in Norway.  Waldemar
the Dane-king gave Erling the title of earl;  he became the greatest man
after that, and a mighty chief, as is written in his saga.  Eindrid the
young came from abroad some winters later than earl Rognvald and his
men, and he threw in his lot then with king Eystein, for he would have
nothing to do with Erling.  But after the fall of king Eystein, these,
Eindrid the young and Sigurd son of Havard the freeman of Reyrir, got
together a band, and chose as king Hacon broadshoulders, son of king
Sigurd Harold’s son.  They slew Gregory Dag’s son and king Ingi.  Those
two, Eindrid and Hacon, fought with Erling wryneck under Sekk;  there
Hacon fell but Eindrid fled.  Earl Erling let Eindrid the young be slain
sometime after away east in the Bay.

98.       Earl Rognvald stayed a very long time in Hordaland that summer
when he came into the land, and heard then many tidings out of the
Orkneys.  It was told him that there was great strife, and the
chieftains had gone into two bands, but there were few who sat by so
that they had no share in the strife.  Earl Harold was on one side, but
on the other earl Erlend and Sweyn Asleif’s son.  And when the earl
heard that said, he sang this song:

               “Now the princes of the people

               Have gone back on many an oath;

               That is blasphemy ‘gainst God;

               Men’s ill redes now come to light;

               But this evil will not lessen

               In those who guile devise at home;

               So let us on lissom leg

               Step light so long as beard will wag.”

The earl had no ships at his command.  Then he looked to his kinsfolk
and friends that they should get him some longships made that winter. 
They took that well upon them, and granted him in that matter just what
he asked.  The earl busked him that summer to fare west into the Orkneys
to his realm, and he was very late boun, for he lingered much.  He fared
west on board that trading-ship which Thorhall Asgrim’s son owned;  he
was an Icelander, and of great kindred, and had a house south at
Bishopstongues.  The earl had for all that a great train on board the
ship and a noble band of companions.  They made Scotland when the winter
was far spent, and long lay off Scotland under Turfness.  The earl came
a little before Yule into the Orkney to his realm.

99.       Now shall be told what tidings happened in the Orkneys while
earl Rognvald was abroad on his travels.

That same summer that the earl had fared away from the land, came east
from Norway king Eystein son of Harold Gilli;  he had a great host.  And
when he came into the Orkneys he steered with his host for South
Ronaldshay.  Then he heard that earl Harold Maddad’s son had fared over
to Caithness with a twenty-benched ship, and had eighty men with him; 
he lay in Thurso.  But when king Eystein heard of him, he manned three
cutters and fared west over the Pentland-firth, and so to Thurso.  He
came there so that the earl and his men were not ware of it before the
king’s men boarded their ship and made the earl captive.  He was led
before the king, and their dealings turned out so, that the earl
ransomed himself with three marks of gold, but his realm he gave over
into king Eystein’s hands, so that he was to hold it of him ever after. 
Then the earl became king Eystein’s man, and bound that with oaths.  And
after that king Eystein fared to Scotland, and harried there that
summer.  He harried far and wide too round England on that voyage, and
he was thought to aveng king Harold Sigurd’s son.  After that king
Eystein fared east into his realm to Norway, and very various stories
were told of his doings.  Earl Harold stayed behind in the Orkneys in
his realm, and he was in good favour with most men.  Earl Maddad his
father was then dead, but his mother Margaret had come out into the
Orkneys.  She was a fair woman and very proud and haughty.  At that time
David the Scot-king died, and Malcolm his grandson (23) was taken to be
king;  he was a child in years when he took the realm.

100.  Erlend, son of Harold smooth-tongue, was most of his time in
Thurso, but sometimes he was in the Southern isles, or a-roving after
earl Ottar was dead.  He was the most promising man, and thoroughly
trained and skilled in most things, bountiful of money, blithe and ready
to listen to good advice, and of all men most beloved by his followers. 
He had a great train.  Anakol was the name of a man, he was Erlend’s
fosterer, and had most weight in his counsels.  Anakol was a viking and
a man of good birth and great hardihood, a Southislander by kin;  he was
Erlend’s counsellor.

When Erlend heard that earl Rognvald was gone away from his realm abroad
to Jerusalem, he went to him to give him the title of earl and Caithness
as a lordship, as his father Harold had held it from king David, king
Malcolm’s grandfather.  King Malcolm was then a child in years, but for
that Erlend had there many noble kinsfolk who backed his cause, it came
about that the Scot-king gave Erlend the title of earl, and granted him
half Caithness with his kinsman Harold.  Then Erlend fared to Caithness
and met his friends there.  After that he gathered force to himself and
fared out into the Orkneys.  There he bade them do homage to him, but
earl Harold Maddad’s son got a force together at once, when he heard of
Erlend, and had many men on his side.  Then men went between those
kinsman, and tried to set them at one.  Erlend asked for half the isles
with Harold, but he will not give them up, and the end of it was that
peace was fixed for that year.  But the plan was that Erlend shall fare
east into Norway to find king Eystein and ask for that half which earl
Rognvald owned, and then Harold said he would give it up.  Then Erlend
fared east into Norway, but Anakol and some of his train were behind in
the Orkneys.  Gunni Olaf’s son, Sweyn Asleif’s son’s brother, had got a
child by Margaret earl Harold’s mother, but the earl made him an
outlaw.  From that unfriendliness sprung up between Sweyn and earl
Harold, and Sweyn sent Gunni south into the Lewes to his friend Ljotolf,
with whom Sweyn had been before.  Fogl was the name of Ljotolf’s son; 
he was with earl Harold, and he and Sweyn had little to say to one
another.  When earl Erlend fared east to Norway, earl Harold fared over
to Caithness, and sat that winter in Wick.  Sweyn Asleif’s son was then
in Thraswick in Caithness, and had under his charge the farms of his
stepsons.  He had first to wife Ragnhild Ogmund’s daughter;  they were
but a short while together.  Olaf was their son.  After that he had to
wife Ingirid Thorkel’s daughter.  Andrew was their son.  It was on
Wednesday in Passion week that Sweyn had gone up into Lambaburg with
some men.  They saw where a ship of burden fared from the east off the
Pentland firth, and Sweyn thought he knew that there must be earl
Harold’s men, whom he had sent after his scatts to Shetland.  Sweyn bade
his men go on board ship, and pull out to the ship of burden, and so
they did.  They took the ship of burden and all that was worth anything,
but shoved earl Harold’s men ashore, and they went east to Wick and told
him.  Earl Harold said little in answer, and says that he and Sweyn
would take it by turns to have each other’s goods, and he quartered his
men about at different houses during Easter.  Then the Caithness men
said that the earl was on his visitations.  But as soon as ever Easter
was over, Sweyn fared away with the ship of burden and a rowing cutter
to the Orkneys.  And when they came to Scapa-neck, they took there a
ship from Fogl Ljotolf’s son;  he was then come from the south out of
the Lewes from his father, and meant to go to earl Harold.  And in that
trip they took about twelve ounces of gold from Sigurd cloven-foot, earl
Harold’s house-carle;  that money had been brought into his house, but
they were in Kirkwall who owned it.  After that Sweyn fared over to the
Ness and up into Scotland, and found Malcolm the Scot-king at Aberdeen. 
He was then nine winters old. (24)  There Sweyn was a month in very good
cheer, and the Scot-king bade him take all those rights and easements in
Caithness which he had owned ere he fell out with earl Harold.  Sweyn
thanked the king.  After that Sweyn busked him to go away, and he and
the Scot-king parted with great love.  Then Sweyn fared to his ships,
and sailed from the south to the Orkneys.  Anakol was then in Deerness
when Sweyn and his men sailed from the south, and they saw his sails off
the east side of the Mull.  They sent to Sweyn and his men Gauti the
Master of Skeggbjornsstead, and Anakol begged that Sweyn would come to
terms with Fogl about taking the ship, for there was kinship between
them, and Fogl was then with Anakol.  But when Gauti found Sweyn and his
men, and told him Anakol’s words, then Sweyn bade them sail to Sanday
and meet him there, for he said he must sail thither at once.  There was
a very numerous meeting there to make matters up, and the atonement was
only brought about slowly.  But the end of it was that Sweyn alone was
to make what award he chose.  After that Anakol threw in his force with
Sweyn, and they bound themselves to try to bring about an atonement
between him and earl Erlend when he came from the east, for there was
feud between them for the burning of Frakok.  Sweyn and Anakol fared to
Stronsay, and lay by Hofsness some nights.  Thorfinn Brusi’s son then
dwelt in Stronsay;  he had then to wife Ingigerd Sweyn’s sister, whom
Thorbjorn clerk had left to herself.  When Sweyn and Anakol lay by
Hofsness, earl Erlend sailed up from off the main, and Anakol and
Thorfinn Brusi’s son fared out at once to meet him, and tried to bring
about an atonement between him and Sweyn, and the earl took the offer of
atonement heavily, and said Sweyn had always gone against the stream
towards his kinsfolk and himself, but not kept to what he \[Sweyn\] and
earl Ottar had settled as to lending him \[Erlend\] strength to get the
realm for himself. (25)  Then Sweyn offered to the earl his following
and counsel, and they were trying to bring the atonement about all day,
but it was not brought about before they both of them, Anakol and
Thorfinn, gave out that they would follow Sweyn out of the islands if
the earl would not be atoned with him.  Earl Erlend brings back from the
east that message from king Eystein, that he should have that lot of the
Orkneys which earl Harold had owned before.  Sweyn gave that counsel,
when he and the earl were set at one, that they should fare at once to
find earl Harold ere he heard that of others, and bid him give up the
realm to him.  It was done as Sweyn said.  They met earl Harold off
Kjarrekstead, (26) and he lay on shipboard.  It was on Michaelmas
morning that earl Harold and his men saw that longships were faring up
to them, and they doubted that there would be strife.  They ran from
their ships and into the castle that was then there.  Arni Hrafn’s son
was the name of a man who ran from earl Harold’s ship and to Kirkwall; 
he was so scared that he did not know that he had his shield at his back
before he stuck fast in the church-door.  Thorgeirr was the name of a
man who was there inside and saw him Arni’s messmates thought that he
was lost, and looked for him two days.  Earl Erlend and Sweyn ran from
their ships to the castle after earl Harold and his men, and attacked
them all that day both with fire and weapons.  They made a very stout
defence, and the darkness of night parted them.  There many men were
wounded on either side, but earl Harold and his men had surely been worn
out and forced to give themselves up to them if the onslaught had lasted
longer.  But next morning freemen came up, friends of both sides, and
tried to bring about an atonement between them, and Sweyn and earl
Erlend were loath to make matters up.  But still it came about that they
were set at one on these terms, that earl Harold swore oaths that Erlend
should have his  (Harold’s), share of the isles, and that he would never
make any claim against him for that realm.  These oaths were taken
before many of the best men then in the isles as witnesses, and after
that earl Harold fared over to the Ness, and so on up to Scotland to his
kinfolk, then few Orkneyingers fared with him.  Earl Erlend and Sweyn
and his companions summoned a Thing of the freemen in Kirkwall, and the
freemen came to it from all the isles.  Earl Erlend pleaded his cause,
and so too did many others of his friends and kinsfolk.  Then the earl
said that king Eystein had given him that realm in the Orkneys which
earl Harold had before had in his keeping;  then he begged the freemen
to do him homage.  He had there with him Eystein’s letters, which proved
that he spoke sooth.  So it came about that the freemen yielded
obedience to earl Erlend, and then he took under him all the Orkneys,
and made himself chief over them.  But it was so settled between earl
Erlend and the freemen, that he should not withhold from earl Rognvald
that half of the realm which he owned, if it were fated that he should
come back.  But if earl Rognvald claimed more than half, then the
freemen should hold that against him along with earl Erlend.  Sweyn
Asleif’s son was ever with earl Erlend, and bade him be wary, and not
trust too well earl Harold or the Scots.  They lay most part of the
winter on shipboard, and kept spies out away from them.  But when Yule
drew on, and the weather began to grow hard, then Sweyn fared home to
Gairsay to his house, but bade the earl be not the less wary though they
were parted, and so the earl did, for he lay long on shipboard, and
gathered stores together in no one place for his Yule feast.

101.   It happened on the tenth day of Yule that Sweyn sat in Gairsay
and drank with his house-carles;  he began to speak and rubbed his
nose:  “It is my meaning that now earl Harold is on his voyage to the
isles.”  His house-carles say that that were unlikely for the storms’
sake that then lay over them.  He said he knew that they would think
so.  “And now,” says he, “I will not send the earl news of this for my
foreboding all alone, but I doubt though that there is worse counsel in
that.”  So that talk fell to the ground, and they drank on as before. 
Earl Harold began his voyage out to the Orkneys at Yule.  He had four
ships and one hundred men;  he lay two nights off Grimsay.  They landed
at Hamnavoe in Hrossey;  thence they went the thirteenth day of Yule to
Firth.  They were in Orkahow while a snow-storm drove over them, and
there two men of their band lost their wits and that was a great
hindrance to their journey.  It was in the night that they came to
Firth;  it happened then that earl Erlend had gone on board his ship,
but he had drunk that day up at the house.  Earl Harold and his men slew
two men there, and the name of one of them was Kettle; (1) but they took
prisoners four men:  Arnfinn Anakol’s brother, Ljot was the name of the
second, and two others.  Earl Harold fared back to Thurso, and Thorbjorn
clerk and his men.  But those brothers Benedict and Eric fared to
Lambaburg, and had Arnfinn along with them.  At once that very night, as
soon as earl Erlend was ware of the strife, then he sent men to Gairsay
to tell Sweyn, and he \[Sweyn\] made them run down to his ships to the
sea the day after, and fared to find earl Erlend, as he had sent word,
and they were then on shipboard most of the winter.  Benedict and his
brother sent that message, that Arnfinn would only be set loose on those
terms, if earl Erlend and his men would let them have that ship which
they had taken off Kjarrekstead.  The earl was rather eager that the
ship should be given up;  but Anakol set his face against it, and said
that Arnfinn should get away not a whit the less that winter, though
that were not granted.  It was on the midweekday (Wednesday) next before
the Fast that they Anakol and Thorstein Ragna’s son, fared over to the
Ness with twenty men in a cutter, and came off the coast in the night. 
They drew the cutter into a hidden cove under a certain burg. (2)  They
go up on shore, and hide themselves in thickets a short way from the
house in Thraswick, but they dressed up the ship so, that it looked just
as if men lay in every seat.  Men had come to the ship in the morning,
and had no doubt as to what she was.  Anakol and his men saw men row in
a ship away from the burg and land at the oyce. (3)  Then they saw a man
too ride out from the burg, and another walking, and knew it was Eric. 
Then Anakol and his men parted their force, and ten of them went to the
sea, down the river, and watched that no one should come to the ship,
but the other ten went to the house.  Eric came to the homestead a
little before them, and went up to the hall, there he heard the sound of
armed men, and then ran into the hall, and out at the other door, and
wanted to go to the ship, but there the men were in his way, and he got
taken captive there, and was carried out into the isles to earl Erlend. 
Then men were sent to earl Harold, and it was told him that Eric would
not be set free till Arnfinn and his companions came safe and sound to
earl Erlend, and that was done as he was told.  Next spring earl Harold
busked him from Caithness, and fared north to Shetland;  he meant to
take the life of Erlend the young, for he had asked the hand of Margaret
the earl’s mother, but she had refused.  After that he got himself a
train of followers, and took her away from the Orkneys, and bore her
north to Shetland, and sat himself down in Moussaburg;  there he had
laid in great stores.  But when earl Harold came to Shetland, he sat
down round the burg and forbade all supplies, but it is an unhandy place
to get at by storm.  Then men came up and tried to bring about an
atonement between them.  Erlend asked that the earl should give him the
woman in marriage, but offered himself to strengthen the earl’s hands,
and said that it was worth more to him to get back his realm, but said
too that the likeliest way to do that was to make himself as many
friends as he could.  That prayer many backed with Erlend, and this was
the end of the matter, that they were set at one, and Erlend got
Margaret, and after that made ready to follow the earl, and they fared
that summer east to Norway.  And when that was heard in the Orkneys,
then earl Erlend and his men laid their plans, and Sweyn was eager that
they should fare a sea-roving, and so get money.  And so they did, and
fared south to Broadfirth, and harried off the east of Scotland.  They
fared south to Berwick. (4)

Canute the wealthy was the name of a man, he was a chapman, and sat very
often in Berwick.  Sweyn and his companions took a ship large and good,
which Canute owned, and much goods aboard her;  there too his wife was
on board.  After that they fared south under Blyholm.  Canute was then
in Berwick when he heard of the robbery;  he made a bargain with the men
of Berwick for a hundred marks of silver, that they go out to get back
the goods.  They were most of them chapmen who went out to look for the
goods.  They fared in fourteen ships to look for them.  Now when Erlend
and Sweyn lay under Blyholm, Sweyn spoke to them, and told them that men
should lie with no awning over their ships;  said he had got it into his
head that the men of Berwick would come in a great company to look them
up at night.  But there was a sharp wind on, and men gave no heed to
what he said, and all men lay under their awnings, save that on Sweyn’s
ship there was no awning aft of the mast.  Sweyn sat up on the poop in a
hairy cloak on a chest and said he was so boun to spend the night. 
Einar skew was the name of a man on board Sweyn’s ship;  he spoke and
said that far too many stories had been told of Sweyn’s bravery;  “he is
called a better man than other men, but now he dares not throw an awning
over his ship.”  Sweyn made as though he heard not.  There were watchmen
upon the holm;  Sweyn heard how they could not agree as to what they
saw.  He went up to them and asked about what they strove.  They said
they could not tell what they saw.  Sweyn was the sharpest-sighted of
all men, and when he looked steadfastly at the spot, he saw that there
were fourteen ships coming on them from the north all together.  He went
on board his ship and bade the watchmen go on board the ships and tell
what had happened.  Sweyn bade his men wake up and throw off their
awnings.  After that a great cry arose, and most men shouted out to
Sweyn, and asked what counsel should be taken;  he bade men be still,
but said his counsel was to lay their ships between the holm and the
land, “and try if they will so sail round away from us;  but if that may
not be, then let us row against them as hard as we can.”  But other
counsellors spoke against that, and said the only plan was to sail away,
and so it was done.  Then Sweyn spoke:  “If ye will sail away, then beat
out to sea.”  Sweyn was last boun.  Anakol waited for him.  But when
Sweyn’s ship went faster, then he made them slacken sail, and waited for
Anakol, and would not that he should be left behind with a single ship. 
Then Einar skew said, as Sweyn and his men sailed with all sail: 
“Sweyn,” says he, “is it not so that our ship stands still?”  Sweyn
says:  “I do not think that,”  says he, “but I counsel thee that thou
speakest no more against my bravery, if thou canst not tell for fear’s
sake whether the ship walks under thee or not, for this is the fastest
of all ships under sail.”  The men of Berwick sailed south away from
them, but Sweyn and his fleet then turned in under the mainland.  And
when they came under the Isle of May, then Sweyn sent men to Edinburgh
to tell the Scot-king of the spoil they had taken, but ere they came to
the burg, twelve men rode to meet them, and they had bags full of silver
at their cruppers.  And when they met, the Scottish men asked after
Sweyn Asleif’s son;  they said where he was, and asked what they wanted
of him.  The Scots said that they had been told that Sweyn was taken
prisoner, and the Scot-king had sent them to set him free with that
money which they carried with them.  Sweyn’s men told them the news in
return, and fared to find the Scot-king, and told him their errand.  The
king spoke lightly of the loss of Canute’s money, and sent Sweyn a
costly shield and other good gifts more.  Earl Erlend and Sweyn fared
that autumn to the Orkneys and came back rather late.

That summer earl Harold fared to Norway, as was before told.  Then too
earl Rognvald came back from abroad from Micklegarth into Norway, and
Erling wry-neck with him, as was before written.  And earl Rognvald came
into the Orkneys a little before Yule.

102\. Then men at once came between earl Rognvald and earl Erlend, and
tried to set them at one.  Then men brought forward that understanding
which had passed between freemen and earl Erlend, that he should not
withhold his share of the isles from earl Rognvald.  Then things came to
a fixed meeting between those earls in Kirkwall, and at that meeting
they made matters up and bound that by oaths.  That was two nights
before Yule, and the terms of the settlement were that each of them
should have half of the isles, and both should guard them against earl
Harold or any others if they laid claim to them.  Earl Rognvald had then
no force of ships before the summer after, when his ships came from the
east out of Norway.  That winter all stood quiet, but in the spring
after the earls laid their plans against earl Harold if he should come
from the east, and earl Erlend and Sweyn Asleif’s son fared to Shetland,
and were to lie in wait for him there if he showed himself.  Earl
Rognvald fared over to Thurso, for they thought that Harold might make
thither when he came from the east, for he had many kinsfolk and friends
there.  Earl Erlend and Sweyn were in Shetland that summer, and stopped
all ships so that no one might go to Norway.  Earl Harold fared that
summer from the east out of Norway, and had seven ships;  he made the
Orkneys, but three of his ships were driven into Shetland by stress of
weather, and Erlend and Sweyn took them.  When earl Harold came into the
Orkneys, there he heard those tidings, that earl Rognvald and earl
Erlend were atoned, and that each of them was to have half the isles. 
Then earl Harold thought he saw that as for his choice, nothing was
meant for him.  Then he took that counsel to fare over to the Ness at
once to find earl Rognvald ere earl Erlend and Sweyn came back from
Shetland.  Earl Erlend and Sweyn were then in Shetland, when they heard
that earl Harold was come into the Orkneys with five ships;  they held
on south at once into the isles with five ships,  and got caught in
Dynrace, (5) in dangerous tides and a storm of wind, and there they
parted company.  Then Sweyn bore up for the Fair isle in two ships, and
they thought the earl lost.  Thence they held on their course south
under Sanday, and there earl Erlend lay before them with three ships,
and that was a very joyful meeting.  Thence they fared to Hrossey, and
heard there that earl Harold had fared over to the Ness.  But that is to
be said of earl Harold’s doings, that he came to Thurso and had six
ships.  Earl Rognvald was then up the country in Sutherland, and sat
there at a wedding, at which he gave away his daughter Ingirid to Eric
staybrails.  News came to him at once that earl Harold was come into
Thurso.  Earl Rognvald rode down with a great company from the bridal to
Thurso.  Eric staybrails was Harold’s kinsman, and he did all he could
to set them at one again, and many others backed that with him, and said
that it was as clear as day to them that they ought not to let
themselves be parted for the sake of that kinship and those foster-ties
and that fellowship which had been between them.  So it came about that
a meeting was brought to pass between them and peace given, and they
were to meet in a castle at Thurso, and they two talk alone, but each of
them was to have as many men as the other hard by the castle.  They
talked long, and things went well with them.  They had not met before
since earl Rognvald came into the land.  And when the day was far spent,
earl Rognvald was told that earl Harold’s people were flocking thither
with arms.  Earl Harold said that no harm would come of that.  Next
after that they heard great blows struck outside, and then they ran
out.  There was come Thorbjorn clerk with a great train of men, and he
began straightway to wound and maimearl Rognvald’s men when they met. 
The earls called out that they should not fight.  Then men ran up out of
the town and parted them.  There fell thirteen of earl Rognvald’s
house-carles, but he himself was wounded in the face.  After that their
friends did their best to set them at one again, and so it came about
that they were atoned and bound anew their friendship with oaths.  This
was four nights before Michaelmas.  Then too that counsel was taken that
they should fare at once that night out into the Orkneys against earl
Erlend and Sweyn.  They held on with thirteen ships west on the Pentland
firth, and ran across to Rognvaldsey, (6) and made the land in Vidvoe,
and there went on shore.  Earl Erlend and his men lay on shipboard in
Bardswick, and thence they saw a great company in Rognvaldsey, and sent
out spies thither, and then they had sure news that the earls had been
set at one.  It was also told them that they would not let them have the
power either of strand-slaughter or any other stores of food, and must
so mean then and there to cut off their food in the isles.  Then earl
Erlend and his men went to talk, and he sought counsel of his men.  But
they all agreed with one voice that Sweyn should see to it what counsel
should be taken.  But Sweyn gave utterance to this decision, that they
should at once that very night sail over to the Ness, and said that they
had no strength to strive with both of them there in the isles.  He made
that show before the people at large, that they would fare to the
Southern isles, and be there that winter.  That was Michaelmas eve when
they sailed on the firth, but as soon as ever they came to Caithness,
they hastened up into the country, and drove down to the shore great
droves of cattle to slaughter and slaughtered them, and put them on
board their ships.  Great storms were on and foul weather, and the firth
was always impassable.  But as soon as ever there was a fair wind, Sweyn
sent men in a boat to the other side from the Ness to say that earl
Erland had slaughtered cattle on the shore in Caithness, and that they
lay boun to sail to the Southern isles as soon as ever they got a
breeze.    And when these tidings came to earl Rognvald's ears, he
brought them before a meeting of householders, and spoke to his people. 
He bade his men be wary and keep good watch, and lie every night on
board their ships, "for there is not an hour of the day or night that I
do not look for Sweyn here in the Orkneys, and so much the rather that
he made so many words about how he would fare out of the land."

         At the beginning of winter Sweyn and his companions fared out
of Thurso, and turned west round the coast of Scotland.  They had seven
ships, and all well manned and trimmed and big.  They began their
passage by the help of oars alone.  But when they were come on their
course away from the Ness, earl Rognvald's spies fared out into the
isles, and told him these tidings.  The earls then rowed their ships to
Scapaneck, and earl Rognvald would that they should lie on board their
ships a while.  Now when Sweyn and his companions had got about as far
west as Staur, Sweyn spoke and said that they would not plague
themselves any longer by rowing, and bade them put their ships about and
hoist their sails.  This plan the men thought rather foolish, but still
it was done as Sweyn would.  But when they had sailed about, the
war-snakes ran swiftly before the wind. (7)  And nothing is told of
their voyage before they come to Vogland (8) in the Orkneys.  There they
heard that the earls lay at Scapa-neck with fourteen ships off
Knarstead.  There was then Erlend the young and Eric staybrails, and
many other noble men.

103  Thorbjorn clerk had gone east to Paplay at Firth to the house of
Hacon churl, his father-in-law.  Thorbjorn then had his daughter
Ingigerd to wife.  It was four nights before Simon's mass that Sweyn
uttered that decision, that he would row up and make an onslaught on the
earls at night.  But that seemed rather foolhardy considering the
difference of force which there was.  Still Sweyn would have his way,
and so it was, for the earl too was rather eager for it.

At even a storm of soft melting sleet set in;  then earl Rognvald went
away from his ship and meant to go to Ofir to his house;  he knew no
cause for fear;  he was with six men.  They came to Knarstead in the
sleet storm.  There dwelt Botolf bungle, a man from Iceland and a good
skald.  He asked earl Rognvald to be there with him the night over, and
tried to talk him over with many words.  They went in, and their clothes
were pulled off them;  they lay down to sleep, but Botolf was to keep
watch.  That self same night earl Erlend and his men pulled up against
earl Harold and his men, and came upon them unawares, so that they knew
nothing of their coming before they heard the warcry.  Then they ran to
their arms, and defended themselves like men.  There was great
slaughter, and the onslaught ended so that earl Harold fled away up on
shore, when only five men were left upstanding on board the ship.  There
fell Bjarni Erlend the young's brother, a man of rank and worth, and a
hundred men with him, but a whole crowd were wounded.  All men ran from
their ships and fled up on the land.  Few fell of earl Erlend's men, but
the earl took there fourteen ships that the earls owned, and all the
goods that were on board them.  When the most of the work was done, they
heard that earl Rognvald had gone away from his ship that evening, and
first up to Knarstead, and thither they fared.  Botolf the master was
outside before the door when they came there, and he gave them a hearty
greeting.  They asked whether earl Rognvald were there by chance. 
Botolf said he had been there that night.  But they behaved wildly, and
asked where he then was, and said he must know.  Botolf stretched out
his hand up and round about the yard, and sang a song:

               "After fowls the chieftain fares;

               Soldiers shoot their weapons well;

               Yonder heath-hen 'neath the hill

               May have hope of blow on neck;

               There the cross-bow crushes heath-poults

               Wondrously when warriors meet,

               Warrior stems that wound the snake; (9)

               The king defends his land with sword."

The earl's men ran headlong out of the "town," (10) and he thought he
had the best of it who ran fastest and first got power over the earl. 
But Botolf went indoors and woke up the earl, and tells him those
tidings that had happened in the night, and also what the earl's men
were after.  Then they jumped up and clothed themselves, and fared away
at once, and to Orfir to the earl's house, and when they came there,
earl Harold was there before them in hiding.  Then they fared at once
over to the Ness each in his boat, the one with three men and the other
with four men.  All their men fared over to the Ness as they got
passages.  Earl Erlend and Sweyn took all the earl's ships and very much
goods.  Sweyn Asleif's son made them hand over to him as his share all
earl Rognvald's treasures that were taken on board his ship, and he sent
them to earl Rognvald over to the Ness.  Sweyn was very eager that earl
Erlend and his men should station their ships out in Vogaland, and that
they should lie in that part of the Firth (11) where they could see any
sailing of ships as soon as ever they put out from the Ness.  He thought
it good thence to lie in wait for attacks, if there were any chance of a
passage.  But earl Erlend made up his mind, for the sake of the egging
on of his levies, that they should fare north to Damsay, and there they
drank by day in a great hall, but lashed their ships together every
evening, and slept in them by night.  And so it went up to the Yule
fast.  It was five nights before Yule, that Sweyn Asleif son fared east
to Sandwick to Sigrid his kinswoman;  he was to make up a quarrel
between her and her neighbour, whose name was Bjorn.  But ere he fared
away, he spoke to earl Erlend that he should sleep on shipboard by
night, and be then not less wary though he \[Sweyn\] were not with him. 
Sweyn was one night at the house of his kinswoman Sigrid.

104  Gisl was the name of a man;  he was Sweyn's tenant and dear
friend.  He made a prayer to Sweyn that he should come as a guest to his
house, and see how matters stood with him.  He had made them brew
liquor, and wated to tap it for Sweyn and his men.  When they came at
even to Gil's (12) house, it was told them that earl Erlend had not gone
to the ships the evening before.  As soon as ever Sweyn heard this, he
sent Margad Grim's son and two other men to the earl, and bade him take
heed to his counsel, though he had not done so the night before;  "but,"
says he, "methinks it is to be dreaded that I shall need to take counsel
for this earl but a short while longer."  Margad and his companions
fared to find earl Erlend, and told him Sweyn's words.  The earl's men
said he \[Sweyn\] had wondrous ways;  they said that one while he
thought nothing too dangerous, but sometimes he was so afraid that he
scarce knew how to keep himself or others safe.  They said that they
would sleep in peace on land, and not fare to the ships.  The earl said
it should be so as Sweyn had laid it down;  and the end of it was, that
the earl went on board his own ship with four-and-twenty men, but all
the others lay up at the house.  Margad and those who were on board
Sweyn's ship lay in another bay a short way off thence.

This very same night earl Rognvald and earl Harold came unawares upon
earl Erlend, so that those watchmen who watched on the isle and on the
ship were none of them aware of it before they boarded the ship.  Orm
was the name of a man, and Ufi was another;  they were in the forehold
on board earl Erlend's ship.  Ufi jumped up, and would wake the earl,
and could not get him awakened, so dead drunk was he.  Ufi caught up the
earl in his arms, and leapt overboard with him, and into the after boat
which floated by the ship's side;  but Orm leapt over on the other side,
and he got safe to land.  But the earl lost his life, and most of the
other men who were in the ships. (13)  The men on board Sweyn's ship
wakened at the war cry, and cut the cable asunder, and pulled out off
the ness, but the full moon gave a strong light, and then they saw that
the earls were pulling away.  Then they thought they could tell that
they must have settled their business with earl Erlend.  Sweyn's house
carles then rowed away, and fared first to Rendale, but sent a man to
Sweyn to tell him such things as they had then seen and heard.  Earl
Harold was for giving peace to earl Erlend's men, but earl Rognvald
would wait first to see whether his body were found, or whether he had
got away.  Earl Erlend's body was found two nights before Yule;  the
shaft of a spear was seen standing up out of the seaweed, and when they
got to it, that spear stood right through him.  His body was borne to
the church, but then peace was given to the earl's men, and so too to
four of Sweyn's house carles who were taken.  John was the name of a man
who was called wing;  he was a sister's son of John wing, of whom it was
spoken before, he had been with Hacon churl, and had got his sister with
child, and then ran away a sea roving with Anakol, but now he was with
earl Erlend, and yet he had not been at the battle.  Earl Erlend's men
made their way to Kirkwall, and took shelter in Magnus' church.  The
earls also fared thither, and then a meeting for a settlement was fixed
in the church.  Then John could not get an atonement with the earls
before he had given his word to keep his wedding with the woman.  There
all men took oaths to the earls, and they settled that matter rather
easily.  John wing bound himself over into earl Harold's hand, and
became his steward.

105  When Sweyn Asleif's son heard of the fall of earl Erlend, he fared
to Rendale, and met his house carles there. (14)  They were able to tell
him plainly of the tidings that had happened in Damsay.  After that
Sweyn and his men fared to Rowsay, and came there at the flood-tide; 
they took all the tackling out of the ship, and laid her up;  they
shared the men about among the houses, and kept spies out between them
and the earls and others of the great men to know what each were doing. 
Sweyn Asleif's son went there up on the fell, and five men with him, and
so down the other side to the sea shore, and stole right up to a
homestead thereabouts in the darkness.  They heard a great chattering
inside.  There were that father and son, Thorfinn and Ogmund, and Erlend
their brother in law.  Erlend, he was boasting about that to that father
and son, that he had given earl Erlend his death blow, but they all
thought they had fought very well.  And when Sweyn heard that, he
springs inside into the house at them, and his companions after him. 
Sweyn was quickest, and he smote Erlend at once his death blow;  but
they took Thorfinn prisoner, and had him off along with them, but Ogmund
was slightly wounded.  Sweyn and his men fared to Thingwall;  there
dwelt then Helgi Sweyn's father's brother, and they were there at the
beginning of Yule in hiding.  Earl Rognvald fared to Damsay at Yule, but
earl Harold stayed behind at Kirkwall.  Earl Rognvald sent men to
Thingwall to Helgi, and bade him tell his kinsman Sweyn if he knew
anything as to where he was, that the earl wanted to bid him to stay
with him at Yule, and said he was willing to have a hand in setting him
and earl Harold at one again.  And when these words came to Sweyn, he
fared to meet earl Rognvald with five men, and was with him the latter
part of Yule. (15)  But after Yule a meeting to make friends was fixed
between Sweyn and the earls;  there all those quarrels were to be put an
end to which had not been already made up.  And when they met, earl
Rognvald did his best to make Sweyn and earl Harold friends, but most
men there were very hard in their counsel against him, who were not
already either kinsfolk or friends of Sweyn;  but those men said that
trouble would always arise from Sweyn if he were not made away with out
of the isles.  But that settlement was made, that Sweyn should pay a
mark of gold to each of the earls, and lose half his lands and his good
longship.  Sweyn answers when he hears the award:  "This atonement will
be best kept if I am not treated with dishonour."  Earl Rognvald would
not take the fine from Sweyn.  He says he will in no wise disgrace him,
he says, too, he thinks there is much more gain to be got from his
friendship than from his goods.  Earl Harold fared after the atonement
to Gairsay to Sweyn's house, and dealt there rather wastefully with his
corn and other gear that he had.  But when Sweyn heard that he brought
it before earl Rognvald, and called it a breach of the atonement, and
said he would fare home and see after his stores.  Earl Rognvald said; 
"Be with me, Sweyn and I will send word to the earl, and again bring him
to speak about your affairs;  but I will not that thou shouldst think to
strive against earl Harold, for he will be too much of a man for thee in
strife, though thou art a mighty man in thyself, and a bold brisk man." 
But Sweyn would not let himself be hindered, and fared with nine men in
a cutter to Gairsay, and came there late at even.  They saw fire in the
bake house; (16) Sweyn fared thither to it.  He wished that they should
take the fire and lay it to the hall, and burn the homestead and the
earl inside it.  Sweyn Blakari's son was the name of a man;  he was the
man of most weight of all those that were there with Sweyn;  he set his
face most against this, and said might be the earl were not in the
house.  But even though he were there, he says that they would not let
his wife or his daughters come out;  but says that it would never do to
burn them inside the house.  Then Sweyn and his men went to the doorway,
and so in towards the hall door;  then those men sprang up who were in
the hall, and shut to the door.  Then Sweyn and his men became aware
that the earl was not in the homestead.  But those who were inside gave
up their defence, and handed over their weapons to Sweyn and his men,
and came out all unarmed, and Sweyn gave peace to all the earl's house
carles.  Sweyn broached all his drink, and had away with him his wife
and daughters.  He asked Ingirid his wife where Harold was, but she
would not tell him:  "Hold thy peace then and point it out to us."  She
would not do that either.  She was the earl's kinswoman.  Sweyn gave up
some of their arms when they came on shipboard.  There was an end of the
atonement between Sweyn and the earl when this news was heard.  Earl
Harold had gone to a little isle to hunt hares.  Sweyn held on his
course to Hellis isle, (17) that is a craggy isle towards the sea, and
there is a great cave in the rock, and the sea came right up into the
mouth of the cave at flood-tide.  When earl Harold's house carles got
their weapons from Sweyn and his men, they fared straightway to find
earl Harold, and told him of their dealings with Sweyn.  The earl made
them launch his ship at once, and egged on his men to row after them,
"and let us now bring matters to the sword's point."  Then they fell to
rowing after them, and each saw the other and knew one another.  And
when Sweyn sees that the earl and his men were drawing up to them, Sweyn
spoke and said:  "We must try and seek some plan, for I have no mind to
meet him when matters are so hot between us, with the difference in
force which there will be;  we will take that counsel," says he, "to
fare to the cave, and see what turn our matters then take."  So Sweyn
and his men did.  They came to the cave at the flood, laid the ship up
there, for the cave sloped up into the rock;  then the sea rose and
flowed into the mouth of the cave.  Earl Harold and his men fared all
day about the isle looking for them and found them not;  they saw too no
sailing of ships from the isle.  They wondered much at that;  they
thought it unlikely that Sweyn should have foundered and sunk.  They
rowed round and round the isle to look for Sweyn and could not find him,
as was likly.  Then the most they could make of it was that Sweyn and
his men must have borne up for other islands;  then they rowed thither
to seek them where they thought likeliest.  Almost as soon as ever the
earl and his men rowed away, the sea fell from the cave's mouth.  Sweyn
and his men had heard the talk of the earl and his men.  Sweyn left his
ship behind in the cave, (18) but they took an old ship of burden on the
isle, which the monks owned, and held on in her to Sanday.  There they
went on land, but shoved off the ship of burden and she drove about from
strand to strand until she broke up.  But Sweyn and his men went up into
the isle, and came to that homestead which is called Valaness, there
that man dwelt whose name was Bard, Sweyn's kinsman.  They called him
out by stealth, and Sweyn said that he wished to stay there.  Bard said
he should do so if he pleased "but I dare not that ye be here save in
hiding."  They went in and were alone in \[a room in\] the house, so
that only a wall of wattle was between them and other men.  There was a
secret doorway in the house in which Sweyn was, and stones were loosely
piled up in it.  That afternoon came John wing earl Harold's steward and
seven of them together.  Bard gave them a hearty welcome, and fires were
made for them, and they roasted themselves at them.  John was very wild
in his words, and talked about the tidings that had happened in those
dealings which the earls had had with Sweyn;  he blamed Sweyn much, and
said he was a dastardly trucebreaker and true to no man;  he had but
just now made peace with earl Harold, and yet he would fare forthwith
and burn the house over his head:  he said too there would never be
peace in the land before Sweyn were driven out of the land.  The master
Bard and John's companions rather spoke up for Sweyn.  After that John
took to speaking ill of earl Erlend, and said that was no scathe though
he had lost his life;  he called him such an overbearing man, that no
one dared to call his head his own for him.  And when Sweyn heard that,
then he could not stand it, and snatched up his weapons and ran at the
secret doorway, and hurled down the stones out of it.  Then there was a
great clatter.  Sweyn meant to run round to the hall door.  John sat in
his shirt and linen breeks.  And when he heard the noise that Sweyn made
he lost no time in lacing up his shoon, but jumped up from the fire, and
set off at once away from the house.  But it was moonless and pitch
dark, and a sharp frost.  He came that night to another homestead, and
was much frostbitten on his feet, so that some of his toes dropped off. 
Sweyn gave peace to John's companions for master Bard's words' sake. 
Sweyn was there that night, but afterwards next morning they fared away
thence with a cutter which Bard owned and gave to Sweyn.  Then they
fared south to Bardswick, and were there at a cave.  Sweyn was sometimes
during the day at the house and drank there, but slept by his ship at
night, and so guarded himself against his foes.

106  It happened one morning early that Sweyn and his men saw a great
longship fare from Hrossey to Rognvaldsey, and Sweyn knew at once that
it was earl Rognvald's ship, that he was wont to steer himself, and they
ran into Rognvaldsey, and thither where Sweyn's cutter lay, and five men
went on shore from the earl's ship, but Sweyn and his men were on a
height, and pelted the earl's men with stones thence.  And when they saw
that from the ship, men got out their arms.  But when Sweyn and his men
saw that they ran down from the height and to the beach, and shoved off
the cutter and jumped into her.  The longship had run up on shore, so
that she was fast.  Sweyn stood up in his cutter as they rowed out by
the longship, and had a spear in his hand.  But when earl Rognvald saw
that, then he took a shield and held it before him, but Sweyn did not
throw the spear.  But when the earl saw that they were about to part, he
made them hold up a truce shield, (19) and begged that Sweyn and his men
would come to land.  But when Sweyn saw that, he bade his men pull to
land, and says he would still be best pleased if he could be made
friends with earl Rognvald.

107     After that earl Rognvald and Sweyn went on shore, and they two
talked long together, and things went smoothly with them.  And as they
sat a talking then they saw earl Harold's sailing, as he fared from
Caithness and to Vogaland. (20)  And when the ship bore away under the
island, then Sweyn asked the earl what counsel should be taken now.  The
earl says that Sweyn should fare over to the Ness then and there.  This
was in Lent.  They fared both at the same time out of Rognvaldsey, the
earl he fared to Hrossey, but Sweyn fared west to Stroms, and earl
Harold and his men saw the ship, and thought they knew that Sweyn owned
her.  They put out at once into the firth after them.  And when Sweyn
and his men saw that the earl and his men held on after them;  then they
left their ship and hid themselves away.  But when earl Harold came to
Stroms, they saw Sweyn's ship, and doubted then that the abodes of men
must be too near, and for that they would not land from their ship. 
Amundi was a man's name the son of Hnefi;  he was a friend of earl
Harold, but a father's brother of Sweyn Asleif's son's step-children; 
he came between them then, and got it brought about that the same
atonement should be held which had been made the winter before.  Then a
storm of wind sprung up;  and each side had to stay there that night; 
and Amundi stowed away earl Harold and Sweyn both in one bed.  In that
house many men of each of them took their rest.  After this atonement
Sweyn fared over to the Ness, but earl Harold over to the Orkneys. 
Sweyn heard that the earl had said that he called their peace making
rather loosely made.  Little heed paid Sweyn to that.  He fared south
into the Dales, and was that Easter with Summerled his friend;  but earl
Harold fared north to Shetland, and was there very long that spring. 
Sweyn fared from the south after Easter, and met on the way John wing's
two brothers, the name of the one was Peter down-at-heel, (21) but the
other's Blane.  Sweyn and his men took them captive and stripped them of
all their goods, but brought them to land;  then a gallows tree was hewn
for them.  And when all was ready, Sweyn said that they should run away
up the country;  he said it would be more shame to their brother John
that they should live.  They were long out in the cold and much frozen
when they got to a homestead.  Sweyn fared thence to the Southern isles
to the Lewes, and stayed there a while.  But when John wing heard that
Sweyn had taken his brothers captive, but knew not what he had done with
them, then he fared to Enhallow, (22) and there seized Olaf Sweyn's son,
Kolbein the burly's fosterchild, and fared with him to Westray.  Then
earl Rognvald and he met at Rapness, and when the earl saw Olaf there,
he said:  "Why art thou here, Olaf?"  He answers:  "It is John wing's
doing."  The earl looked to John, and said:  "Why broughtest thou Olaf
hither?"  He answered:  "Sweyn seized my brothers, and I know not that
he has not slain them."  The earl said:  "Carry thou him back as fast as
thou canst, and do not dare to do him any harm, whatever has become of
thy bretheren;  for thou wilt have no peace in the isles, either at
Sweyn's or Kolbein's hands, if thou doest aught to him."

108     After Easter in the spring Sweyn began his voyage from the
Southern isles, and had sixty men.  He held on his course to the
Orkneys, and first to Rowsay.  There he seized that man whose name was
Hacon churl;  he had been with earl Harold when earl Erlend fell.  Hacon
bought himself off with three marks of gold, and so freed himself from
Sweyn.  There in Rowsay Sweyn and his men found that ship which the
earls had awarded that Sweyn should give up, and the bulwarks on both
sides had been hewn out of her.  That earl Rognvald had made them do,
for no one had been willing either to buy or beg the ship from the
earls.  Sweyn held on then to Hrossey, and found earl Rognvald in
Birsay.  The earl gave him a hearty welcome, and Sweyn was with him that
spring.  Earl Rognvald says that was why he had hewn the bulwarks out of
the ship, because he did not wish him to do any hasty deed there in the
isles when he came back from the Southern isles.  Sweyn was there with
earl Rognvald and fourteen men besides himself.  Earl Harold came from
Shetland that spring at Whitsuntide, and as soon as ever he came into
the Orkneys, earl Rognvald sent men to him to say that his will was that
he and Sweyn should make friends anew.  And then the meeting for an
atonement was fixed for the Friday in the Holy Week in Magnus' church,
and earl Rognvald went with a broad axe to the meeting and Sweyn with
him.  Then the self same atonement was agreed upon which had been
brought about the winter before.

109     Then earl Rognvald gave to earl Harold that ship which Sweyn had
owned, but he gave to Sweyn all else that had been awarded from him and
came to his share.  Earl Rognvald and Sweyn stood by the church door
while the sail was being borne out;  for it had been laid up in Magnus'
church;  and Sweyn looked rather cross when they bore out the sail.  The
Saturday after, when nones were over, earl Harold's men came to see
Sweyn Asleif's son, and said that he would that Sweyn should come and
talk with him.  Sweyn brought that message before earl Rognvald, and he
was not very eager that Sweyn should go on this quest;  he says he does
not know whether he might trust them.  But Sweyn went nevertheless, and
six of them together.  The earl sat in a little room on a cross bench,
and Thorbjorn clerk by him.  There were few other men with the earl. 
They greeted the earl worthily;  and he took their greeting well.  They
made room for Sweyn to sit;  so they sat a while and drank.  After that
Thorbjorn went away, and Sweyn and his men said that they then doubted
much as to what the earl was about to take in hand.  Thorbjorn came back
a little after and gave Sweyn a scarlet kirtle and cloak and sword;  he
said he did not know whether he would call them a gift, for those
precious things had been taken from Sweyn the winter before.  Sweyn
accepted these gifts.  Earl Harold gave Sweyn the longship which he had
owned, and half his lands and estates.  He asked Sweyn to come and be
with him, and said their friendship should never fail.  Sweyn took this
well, and went at once that night, and told earl Rognvald how things had
gone with earl Harold and himself.  Earl Rognvald showed that he was
glad at that, and bade Sweyn take heed that they did not fall out again.

110     Sometime after these three chiefs made up their minds to go a
sea roving, Sweyn, Thorbjorn, and Eric.  They fared first to the
Southern isles.  They fared as far west as the Scilly isles, and won
there a great victory in Mary Haven (23) on Columba's mass, and got very
much war spoil.  After that they fared to the Orkneys, and were well
agreed.

After the atonement of earl Rognvald and earl Harold and Sweyn Asleif's
son, the earls were always both together, and earl Rognvald had the
leadership, but they were very good friends.  When they came home from
Scilly, Thorbjorn clerk fared to earl Harold, and became his chief
councillor.  Sweyn fared home to Gairsay, and sat there with a great
band of men in the winters, and had his war spoil to keep up his
household expenses, along with his other stores, which he had there in
the isles.  He had most leaning to earl Rognvald.  Every summer he was
out roving.  It was said that Thorbjorn clerk made things no better
between earl Rognvald and earl Harold.  Thorarin cod-nose was the name
of one of earl Rognvald's body guard and his friend too;  he was always
with the earl.  Thorkell was the name of one of Thorbjorn clerk's
followers and friends.  Those Thorarin and Thorkell, quarrelled over
their drink in Kirkwall, and Thorkell gave Thorarin a wound, and got
away afterwards to Thorbjorn.  Thorarin's messmates followed Thorkell
up, but he and Thorbjorn defended themselves out of a loft.  Then that
was told to the earls, and they came to the spot to part them. 
Thorbjorn would not let earl Rognvald utter an award in this quarrel,
and found fault with the hue and cry that had been made to his house. 
But when Thorarin was whole of his wounds, then he slew Thorkell as he
went to church.  Thorarin ran into the church, but Thorbjorn and his men
ran after him and his followers.  Then that was told to earl Rognvald,
and he went thither with a great company, and asked whether Thorbjorn
meant to break open the church.  Thorbjorn said that the church had no
right to hold those who were inside it.  Earl Rognvald said once for all
the church must not be broken into, and Thorbjorn was hustled away from
the church by the throng of men.  No atonement was made for this. 
Thorbjorn fared over to the Ness, and was there a while.  Then there was
much heard of their doings, for Thorbjorn did much mischief both in the
ravishing of women and in slaughter of men.  Thorbjorn fared by stealth
into the Orkneys, in a cutter, with thirty men with him.  He rushed in
by himself alone in the evening into the tavern where Thorarin was a
drinking.  Thorbjorn smote him at once his death blow;  after that he
ran off in the dark far away.  For this sake earl Rognvald made
Thorbjorn clerk an outlaw over all his realm.  Thorbjorn fared over to
the Ness, and was with his brother in law Hosvir in hiding;  he was
called "the strong";  he had to wife Ragnhilda, Thorbjorn's sister; 
their son was Stephen councillor, Thorbjorn's follower.  A little while
after Thorbjorn fared to see Malcolm the Scot-king, and was with him in
good cheer.  With the Scot-king was the man whose name was Gilli-Odran; 
he was of great kindred and a very unfair man;  he fell under the wrath
of the Scot-king for the mischief and manslaying which he wrought in his
realm.  Gilli-Odran ran away into the Orkneys, and the earls took him
into their service.  Gilli-Odran was in Caithness, and had the earl's
stewardship there.  Helgi was the name of a man of rank and a
householder in Caithness, he was earl Rognvald's friend.  He and
Gilli-Odran quarrelled about the stewardship, and Gilli-Odran fell upon
him and slew him.  But after the manslaughter he fared away west to
Scotland's firths, and that chief took him in whose name was Summerled
the freeman, he had rule in the Dales, in Scotland's firths.  Summerled
had to wife Ragnhilda daughter of Olaf bitling, (24) the Southern isle
king.  The mother of Ragnhilda was Ingibjorg, the daughter of earl Hacon
Paul's son.  These were the children of Summerled and Ragnhilda:  Dougal
the king, Rognvald, and Angus, that is called the Dale-dwellers' kin. 
Earl Rognvald summoned to him Sweyn Asleif's son ere he went on his
roving cruise.  And when they met, earl Rognvald begged him to keep a
look out for Gilli-Odran if he had a chance.  Sweyn said he could not
tell what might be fated to come of it.

111.          After that Sweyn fared off on his viking cruise, and had
five longships.  And when he came west off Scotland's firths, Sweyn
heard that Summerled the freeman was gone on board ship, and meant to go
a roving;  he had seven ships.  There Gilli-Odran steered one ship, and
he was gone higher up the firths after that force which had not yet
come.  As soon as ever Sweyn heard of Summerled, he ran in to battle
against him, and there was a hard battle.  And in that fight fell
Summerled the freeman, and much folk with him.  There Sweyn became sure
that Gilli-Odran had not been there.  Then Sweyn fared to look him up,
and found him in Murkfirth, and there he slew Gilli-Odran and fifty men
with him.  After that Sweyn fared a sea roving, and back at autumn, as
he was wont.  And when he came home he was not long in meeting earl
Rognvald, and he showed himself well pleased at those deeds.

112.          It was the earl's custom nearly every summer to fare over
to Caithness, and there to go up into the woods and wastes to hunt red
deer or reindeer. (1)  Thorbjorn clerk was with Malcolm the Scot-king,
but sometimes he fared down to the Ness, and was with his friends by
stealth.  He had three friends in Caithness, in whom he placed most
trust.  One was Hosvir his brother in law;  the second Lifolf, who dwelt
in Thorsdale;  the third was Halvard Dufa's son, who dwelt at Force in
Calfdale which goes off from Thorsdale.  These were his bosom friends.

113.          When earl Rognvald had been earl two and twenty winters
since earl Paul was made captive, then the earls fared over to
Caithness, when the summer was far spent, after their wont.  And when
they came to Thurso, then they heard some rumour that Thorbjorn clerk
must be up Thorsdale in hiding, and not at all short-handed, and how he
must mean an onslaught thence if he got a chance.  Then the earls got
men together to them, and fared with a band of one hundred, and twenty
of them ride, but the others were on foot.  They fared in the evening up
the dale and turned in as guests somewhere where there was (what the
Celts call) "erg," but we call "setr" (a shieling on the hill).  That
evening, as men sat by the fires, earl Rognvald sneezed very often. 
Earl Harold spoke and said:  "Shrill sneezing kinsman."  They fared on
up the dale the next morning, and earl Rognvald rode always on in front
that day, and that man with him whose name was Asolf;  another man who
was with him was Jomar his kinsman.  Five of them together so ride a
head up along Calfdale. (2)  And as they fared to the homestead which is
called Force, master Halvard was up on a corn-rick, and piled it up, but
his house carles bore the sheaves up to him.  Earl Harold and his men
rode somewhat behind.  But when Halvardk knew earl Rognvald, he hailed
him by name, and bawled out very loud, and asked him after news, and his
voice might have been heard just as well though he were farther off. 
This was a little way from the sitting room, and the house stood on a
high brink;  but there was a narrow fenced path to ride along up to the
house, and it was very steep.  In this homestead was Thorbjorn clerk
inside, and sat at drink.  The fenced path led up to the house end at
the gable, and there was a doorway in the house and another doorway in
the gable, and stones heaped up loosely in it.  When Thorbjorn and his
men heard the words that passed, and how Halvard hailed earl Rognvald
and his men, they ran at once to their arms, and broke down the stones
out of the secret door, and sprang out at it.  Thorbjorn runs round the
gable, and to the fence of the path.  Just then the earl and his men had
come to the door.  Then Thorbjorn smote at once at the earl, but Asolf
threw his arms in the way, and the stroke toomk off his hand. 
Afterwards the sword came on the earl's chin, and that was a great
wound.  Asolf said, when he got the stroke:  "Let those follow the earl
better who have more gifts to pay him for."  He was then eighteen
winters old, and was newcome to the earl.  Earl Rognvald wanted to jump
off his horse's back when he saw Thorbjorn, but his foot got fast in the
stirrup.  At that moment up came Stephen and thrust at the earl with a
spear.  Then Thorbjorn gave the earl another wound.  But Jomar just then
thrust a spear into Thorbjorn's thigh, and the blow passed on into his
small entrails.  Then Thorbjorn and his men turned to the back of the
house, and there they had to run down a great steep brink, and on to a
soft moor.  Just then up came earl Harold and his men, and their course
was so shaped that they came right in the way of Thorbjorn and his men,
and then each knew the others.  Then the earl's men said, those who knew
what was in the wind, that they should turn after Thorbjorn and his
men;  but earl Harold set his face against it, and says he will wait and
hear what earl Rognvald says about this matter:  "For Thorbjorn is a
very great friend of mine as ye know, for kinship's sake, and many other
ties which are between us."  But those men who were with earl Rognvald
thronged about him dead, (3) and rather a long time passed ere earl
Harold and his men heard the tidings.  Then they \[Thorbjorn and his
men\] were come on to the moor, and across the quagmire which ran along
through the moor.  But for the egging on of the earls' companions, earl
Harold and his men ran down on the moor, and the two bands met at the
quagmire, so that each band was on its own side, and Thorbjorn and his
men held the bank of the dike against them.  Then those men flocked to
him from the homestead who had followed him thither, and all together
they made up fifty men.  Then they defended themselves manfully, and had
a good stronghold to fight from, for the quagmire was both broad and
deep, and the moor was soft up to it in front, and the only way they
could make an onslaught on them was, that they shot at them with
spears.  Thorbjorn told his men that they should not shoot any of them
back.  And when the shots died away, then they began to speak to one
another, and Thorbjorn called out to earl Harold and spoke thus:  "This
I will pray of you, kinsman, that ye give me peace;  but I will offer to
give over this matter into your power, that ye alone may doom it;  and I
will then shrink from no one thing that is in my power, that your honour
may be then more than it was before.  I hope also, kinsman, that thou
wilt bear in mind that those strifes have been, in which thou wouldst
not have made such a difference between us two, earl Rognvald and me,
that thou wouldst have slain me though I had done this deed, I mean when
he kept thee most under his elbow, and let thee have no voice in
anything any more than his knave;  but I gave thee the best gifts, and
looked to do thee honour in all that I could.  But this deed that I have
done in great wickedness, and that lies on me, but the whole realm is
fallen into your power.  You may also know this, that earl Rognvald
meant the same lot for me which I have now given to him;  and it is my
foreboding, kinsman, though things had turned out so that I were dead,
but earl Rognvald were alive, that you would treat him as a man who had
done a deed which you must put up with, but me ye now wish to make a
dead man."  Thorbjorn went on so that many and fair spoken words, and
many men backed that with him, and begged for peace for him.  So it came
that the earl began to listen to what he said when many backed it.  Then
Magnus the son of Havard Gunni's son, a chieftain of the earls' and
their kinsman.  He was the man of most birth and worth in the band with
earl Harold.  He spoke thus:  "It is no business of ours to teach you
what to do, earl, after these great deeds which we see before us.  But I
must say how the common fame will run about them, if peace be given to
Thorbjorn after this work;  and this besides I will say, that when he
dares to say to your face nearly at every word that he hath done this
his ill deed for thee, or wrought it for thy honour, it will be an
everlasting shame and dishonour to thee, and to all the earl's kinsfolk,
if he be not avenged.  I think that earl Rognvald's friends will hold it
for sooth that thou must for a long while have been plotting the earl's
death;  but now hast brought it about.  Or thinkest thou that he will
clear thy conscience when he has to throw off the blame from himself,
but when no one makes an answer for you, when he now tells you to your
face that he has wrought this misdeed for your sake;  or how couldest
thou better prove the truth of that but by now giving him peace.  As for
me, my mind is made up, that he shall never have peace from me, if any
good men and true will follow me, whether it believe or loath to you." 
Just in the same way spoke his brothers, Thorstein and Hacon, and Sweyn
Hroald's son.  Then they turned away from the earl, and went up along
the bank of the dike, and tried where they might get across.  And when
Thorbjorn and his men saw that Magnus and his followers turn away along
the dike, then Thorbjorn began to speak and said:  "Now they must have
split about the counsel to take, the earl will wish to give me peace,
but Magnus will speak against it."  But while they were speaking about
that, Thorbjorn and his men fell away from the dike.  Earl Harold and
his men stood on the dike bank.  And when he saw that nothing would come
of the peace giving, he leapt over the quagmire with all his weapons,
and it was nine ells across the dike.  His companions leapt after him,
and no one got to leap clear over, but most of them got hold of the bank
and so floundered to land.  Thorbjorn's men egged him on that they
should turn either against the earl and his men or against Magnus and
his men, and let their quarrel be settled, there and then.  Then
Thorbjorn said:  "Methinks the best plan is that each man should choose
what he thinks likeliest to stand him in stead, but as for me, I will
still look to meeting with earl Harold."  Most men set their faces
against this, and begged him rather to take to the woods and save
himself.  Thorbjorn would not take that counsel.  So those men his
companions dropped off from him, and looked for help for themselves in
divers ways.  But Thorbjorn and eight men together with him were left
behind.  And when he sees that earl Harold is come over the dike, he
goes to meet him, and fell on his knees before him, and says he brings
him his head.  Many of the earl's men still begged for peace for
Thorbjorn.  Then the earl began to speak, and said:  "Away and save
thyself, Thorbjorn, I have no heart to slay thee, but I will not see
thee henceforth."  Then they were faring down along Calfdale's river,
when these words passed between them.  Magnus and his men pressed on
hard after them, and when the earl saw that, he spoke:  "Save thyself,
Thorbjorn;  I cannot fight for thee against my men."  Then Thorbjorn and
his men parted from the earl's company, and went to some empty
shielings, which are called Asgrim's "erg";  Magnus and his men followed
Thorbjorn and his men up, and forthwith set fire to the house. 
Thorbjorn and his men defended themselves manfully.  And when the house
began to fall down over their heads from the fire, Thorbjorn and his men
came out, and every weapon was at once brought to bear upon them that
could reach them;  they were already much worn out by the force of the
flames.  There all those nine brothers in arms lost their lives.  And
when they came to look what wounds Thorbjorn had, his entrails had slipt
out into that wound which Jomar had given him.  Earl Harold went his way
down along the dale, but Magnus and his men turned back to Force, and
laid out earl Rognvald's body and brought it down to Thurso.

Earl (4) Harold and his men fared with the body away thence out into the
Orkneys with a goodly company, and bestowed burial on it in St. Magnus'
church in the choir;  and there he rested until Bishop Bjarni caused his
halidom (relics) to be taken up by the Pope's leave. (5)  There on the
stone on which earl Rognvald's blood had come when he died, it may still
be seen at this very day as fair as though it were new shed blood.  Earl
Rognvald's death was a great grief, for he was very much beloved there
in the isles, and far and wide elsewhere.  He had been a very great
helper to many men, bountiful of money, gentle, and a steadfast friend; 
a great man for feats of strength and a good skald.  He had a daughter
his only child alive, Ingigerd, whom Eric staybrails had to wife.  Their
children were these:  Harald the young, and Magnus mannikin, Rognvald,
and Ingibjorg, Elin, and Ragnhilda.

114.          After the fall of earl Rognvald, earl Harold took all the
isles under his rule, and became the sole chief over them.  Earl Harold
was a mighty chief, one of the tallest and strongest of men, "dour" and
hard-hearted;  he had to wife Afreka; (6) their children were these: 
Henry and Hacon, Helena and Margaret.  When Hacon was but a few winters
old, Sweyn Asleif's son offered to take him as his foster child, and he
was bred up there, and as soon as ever he was so far fit, that he could
go about with other men, then Sweyn had him away with him a sea roving
every summer, and led him on to the worthiness in everything.  It was
Sweyn's wont at that time, that he sat through the winter at home in
Gairsay, and there he kept always about him eighty men at his beck.  He
had so great a drinking hall, that there was not another as great in all
the Orkneys.  Sweyn had in the spring hard work, and made them lay down
very much seed, and looked much after it himself.  But when that toil
was ended, he fared away every spring on a viking voyage, and harried
about among the Southern isles and Ireland, and came home after
midsummer.  That he called spring-viking.  Then he was at home until the
corn fields were reaped down, and the grain seen to and stored.  Then he
fared away on a viking voyage, and then he did not come home till the
winter was one month spent and that he called his autumn viking.

115.          These tidings happened once on a time, that Sweyn Asleif's
son fared away on his spring cruise, then Hacon earl Harold's son fared
with him;  and they had five ships with oars, and all of them large. 
They harried about among the Southern isles.  Then the folk was so
scared at him in the Southern isles, that men hid all their goods and
chattels in the earth or in piles of rocks.  Sweyn sailed as far south
as Man, and got ill off for spoil.  Thence they sailed out under Ireland
and harried there.But when they came about south under Dublin, then two
keels sailed there from off the main, which had come from England, and
meant to steer for Dublin;  they were laden with English cloths, and
great store of goods was aboard them.  Sweyn and his men pulled up to
the keels, and offered them battle.  Little came of the defence of the
Englishmen before Sweyn gave the word to board.  Then the Englishmen
were made prisoners.  And there they robbed them of every penny which
was aboard the keels, save that the Englishmen kept the clothes they
stood in and some food, and went on their way afterwards with the keels,
but Sweyn and his men fared to the Southern isles, and shared their war
spoil.  They sailed from the west with great pomp.  They did this as a
glory for themselves when they lay in harbours, that they threw awnings
of English cloth over their ships.  But when they sailed into the
Orkneys, they sewed the cloth on the fore part of the sails, so that it
looked in that wise as though the sails were made altogether of
broadcloth.  This they called the broadcloth cruise.  Sweyn fared home
to his house in Gairsay.  He had taken from the keels much wine and
English mead.  Now when Sweyn had been at home a short while, he bade to
him earl Harold, and made a worthy feast against his coming.  When earl
Harold was at the feast, there was much talk amongst them of Sweyn's
good cheer.  The earl spoke and said:  "This I would now, Sweyn, that
thou wouldest lay aside thy sea rovings;  'tis good now to drive home
with a whole wain.  But thou knowest this, that thou hast long
maintained thyself and thy men by sea roving, but so it fares with most
men who live by unfair means, that they lose their lives in strife, if
they do not break themselves from it."  Then Sweyn answered, and looked
to the earl, and spoke with a smile, and said thus:  "Well spoken is
this, lord, and friendly spoken, and it will be good to take a bit of
good counsel from you;  but some men lay that to your door, that ye too
are men of little fairness."  The earl answered:  "I shall have to
answer for my share, but a gossiping tongue drives me to say what I
do."  Sweyn said:  "Good, no doubt, drives you to it, lord.  And so it
shall be, that I will leave off sea roving, for I find that I am growing
old, and strength lessens much in hardships and warfare.  Now I will go
out on my autumn cruise, and I would that it might be with no less glory
than the spring cruise was;  but after that my warfaring shall be
over."  The earl answers:  "'Tis hard to see, messmate, whether death or
lasting luck will come first."  After that they dropped talking about
it.  Earl Harold fared away from the feast, and was led out with fitting
gifts.  So he and Sweyn parted with great love-tokens.

116.          A little after Sweyn busks him for his roving cruise;  he
had seven longships and all great.  Hacon earl Harold's son went along
with Sweyn on his voyage.  They held on their course first to the
Southern isles, and got there little war spoil;  thence they fared out
under Ireland, and harried there far and wide.  They fared so far south
as Dublin, and came upon them there very suddenly, so that the townsmen
were not ware of them before they had got into the town.  They took
there much goods.  They made prisoners there those men who were rulers
in the town.  The upshot of their business was that they gave the town
up into Sweyn's power, and agreed to pay as great a ransom as he chose
to lay upon them.  Sweyn was also to hold the town with his men and to
have rule over it.  The Dublin men swear an oath to do this.  They fared
to their ships at even, but next morning Sweyn was to come into the
town, and take the ransom, place his men about the town, and take
hostages from the townsmen.  Now it must be told of what happened in the
town during the night.  The men of good counsel who were in the town
held a meeting among themselves, and talked over the straits which had
befallen them;  it seemed to them hard to let their town come into the
power of the Orkneyingers, and worst of all of that man whom they knew
to be the most unjust man in the Western lands.  So they agreed amongst
themselves that they would cheat Sweyn if they might.  They took that
counsel, that they dug great trenches before the burg gate on the
inside, and in many other places between the houses where it was meant
that Sweyn and his men should pass;  but men lay in wait there in the
houses hard by with weapons.  They laid planks over the trenches, so
that they should fall down as soon as ever a man's weight comes on
them.  After that they strewed straw on the planks so that the trenches
might not be seen, and so bided the morrow.

117.          On the morning after Sweyn and his men arose and put on
their arms;  after that they went to the town.  And when they came
inside beyond the burg gate the Dublin men made a lane from the burg
gate right to the trenches.  Sweyn and his men saw not what they were
doing, and ran into the trenches.  The townsmen they ran straightway to
hold the burg gate, but some to the trenches, and brought their arms to
bear on Sweyn and his men.  It was unhandy for them to make any defence,
and Sweyn lost his life there in the trenches, and all those who had
gone into the town.  So it was said that Sweyn was the last to die of
all his messmates, and spoke these words ere he died:  "Know this all
men, whether I lose my life today or not, that I am one of the saint
earl Rognvald's bodyguard, and I now mean to put my trust in being there
where he is with God." (7)  Sweyn's men fared at once to their ships and
pulled away, and nothing is told about their voyage before they come
into the Orkneys.  There now is an end of telling about Sweyn;  and it
is the talk of men that he hath been most of a man for his own sake in
the Western lands, both of yore and now a days, of those men who had no
higher titles of honour than he. (8)

After the fall of Sweyn, his sons Olaf and Andrew shared his inheritance
between them.  They made the next summer after Sweyn lost his life a
party-wall in that great drinking hall which he had owned in Gairsay. 
Andrew Sweyn's son had to wife Frida Kolbein the burly's daughter,
sister of Bjarni, bishop of the Orkneyingers.

Earl Harold now ruled over the Orkneys, and was the greatest chief;  he
had to wife afterwards Hvarflada (9) earl Malcolm's daughter of Moray. 
Their children were these:  Thorfinn, David, and John, Gunhilda,
Herborga, and Longlife.
