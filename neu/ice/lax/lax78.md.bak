### Chapter LXXVIII: The Death of Snorri, and the End, A.D. 1030

When Bolli had been one winter in Iceland Snorri the Priest fell ill.
That illness did not gain quickly on him, and Snorri lay very long abed.
But when the illness gained on him, he called to himself all his
kinsfolk and affinity, and said to Bolli, "It is my wish that you shall
take over the manor here and the chieftainship after my day, for I
grudge honours to you no more than to my own sons, nor is there within
this land now the one of my sons who I think will be the greatest man
among them, Halldor to wit."

Thereupon Snorri breathed his last, being sixty-seven years old. That
was one winter after the fall of St. Olaf, so said Ari the Priest
"Deep-in-lore." Snorri was buried at Tongue. Bolli and Thordis took over
the manor of Tongue as Snorri had willed it, and Snorri's sons put up
with it with a good will. Bolli grew a man of great account, and was
much beloved. Herdis, Bolli's daughter, grew up at Holyfell, and was the
goodliest of all women. Orm, the son of Hermund, the son of Illugi,
asked her in marriage, and she was given in wedlock to him; their son
was Kodran, who had for wife Gudrun, the daughter of Sigmund. The son of
Kodran was Hermund, who had for wife Ulfeid, the daughter of Runolf, who
was the son of Bishop Ketill; their sons were Ketill, who was Abbot of
Holyfell, and Reinn and Kodran and Styrmir; their daughter was Thorvor.
whom Skeggi, Brand's son, had for wife, and from whom is come the stock
of the Shaw-men. Ospak was the name of the son of Bolli and Thordis. The
daughter of Ospak was Gudrun, whom Thorarin, Brand's son, had to wife.
Their son was Brand, who founded the benefice of Housefell. Gellir,
Thorkell's son, took to him a wife, and married Valgerd, daughter of
Thorgils Arison of Reekness. Gellir went abroad, and took service with
King Magnus the Good, and had given him by the king twelve ounces of
gold and many goods besides. The sons of Gellir were Thorkell and
Thorgils, and a son of Thorgils was Ari the "Deep-in-lore." The son of
Ari was named Thorgils, and his son was Ari the Strong. Now Gudrun began
to grow very old, and lived in such sorrow and grief as has lately been
told. She was the first nun and recluse in Iceland, and by all folk it
is said that Gudrun was the noblest of women of equal birth with her in
this land. It is told how once upon a time Bolli came to Holyfell, for
Gudrun was always very pleased when he came to see her, and how he sat
by his mother for a long time, and they talked of many things.

Then Bolli said, "Will you tell me, mother, what I want very much to
know? Who is the man you have loved the most?"

Gudrun answered, "Thorkell was the mightiest man and the greatest chief,
but no man was more shapely or better endowed all round than Bolli.
Thord, son of Ingun, was the wisest of them all, and the greatest
lawyer; Thorvald I take no account of."

Then said Bolli, "I clearly understand that what you tell me shows how
each of your husbands was endowed, but you have not told me yet whom you
loved the best. Now there is no need for you to keep that hidden any
longer."

Gudrun answered, "You press me hard, my son, for this, but if I must
needs tell it to any one, you are the one I should first choose
thereto."

Bolli bade her do so. Then Gudrun said, "To him I was worst whom I loved
best."

"Now," answered Bolli, "I think the whole truth is told," and said she
had done well to tell him what he so much had yearned to know.

Gudrun grew to be a very old woman, and some say she lost her sight.
Gudrun died at Holyfell, and there she rests. Gellir, Thorkell's son,
lived at Holyfell to old age, and many things of much account are told
of him; he also comes into many Sagas, though but little be told of him
here. He built a church at Holyfell, a very stately one, as Arnor, the
Earls' poet, says in the funeral song which he wrote about Gellir,
wherein he uses clear words about that matter. When Gellir was somewhat
sunk into his latter age, he prepared himself for a journey away from
Iceland. He went to Norway, but did not there long, and then left
straightway that land and "walked" south to Rome to "see the holy
apostle Peter." He was very long over this journey; and then journeying
from the south he came into Denmark, and there he fell ill and lay in
bed a very long time and received all the last rites of the church,
whereupon he died, and he rests at Roskild. Gellir had taken Skofnung
with him, the sword that had been taken out of the barrow of Hrolf
Kraki, and never after could it be got back. When the death of Gellir
was known in Iceland, Thorkell, his son, took over his father's
inheritance at Holyfell. Thorgils, another of Gellir's sons, was drowned
in Broadfirth at an early age, with all hands on board. Thorkell
Gellirson was a most learned man, and was said to be of all men the best
stocked of lore. Here is the end of the Saga of the men of
Salmon-river-Dale.
