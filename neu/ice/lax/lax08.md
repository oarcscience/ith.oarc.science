### Chapter VIII: The Birth of Hrut and Thorgerd's Second Widowhood, A.D. 916

Herjolf and Thorgerd had not long been together before they had a son.
The boy was sprinkled with water, and was given the name of Hrut. He was
at an early age both big and strong as he grew up; and as to growth of
body, he was goodlier than any man, tall and broad-shouldered, slender
of waist, with fine limbs and well-made hands and feet. Hrut was of all
men the fairest of feature, and like what Thorstein, his mother's
father, had been, or like Ketill Flatnose. And all things taken
together, he was a man of the greatest mettle. Herjolf now fell ill and
died, and men deemed that a great loss. After that Thorgerd wished to go
to Iceland to visit Hoskuld her son, for she still loved him best of all
men, and Hrut was left behind well placed with his relations. Thorgerd
arrayed her journey to Iceland, and went to find Hoskuld in his home in
Salmonriver-Dale. He received his mother with honour. She was possessed
of great wealth, and remained with Hoskuld to the day of her death. A
few winters after Thorgerd came to Iceland she fell sick and died.
Hoskuld took to himself all her money, but Hrut his brother owned
one-half thereof.
