### Chapter XII: Hoskuld Buys a Slave Woman

There were tidings at the beginning of the summer that the king went
with his fleet eastward to a tryst in Brenn-isles, to settle peace for
his land, even as the law laid down should be done every third summer.
This meeting was held between rulers with a view to settling such
matters as kings had to adjudge -- matters of international policy
between Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. It was deemed a pleasure trip to go
to this meeting, for thither came men from well-nigh all such lands as
we know of. Hoskuld ran out his ship, being desirous also to go to the
meeting; moreover, he had not been to see the king all the winter
through. There was also a fair to be made for. At the meeting there were
great crowds of people, and much amusement to be got -- drinking, and
games, and all sorts of entertainment. Nought, however, of great
interest happened there. Hoskuld met many of his kinsfolk there who were
come from Denmark. Now, one day as Hoskuld went out to disport himself
with some other men, he saw a stately tent far away from the other
booths. Hoskuld went thither, and into the tent, and there sat a man
before him in costly raiment, and a Russian hat on his head. Hoskuld
asked him his name.

He said he was called Gilli: "But many call to mind the man if they hear
my nickname -- I am called Gilli the Russian."

Hoskuld said he had often heard talk of him, and that he held him to be
the richest of men that had ever be longed to the guild of merchants.
Still Hoskuld spoke: "You must have things to sell such as we should
wish to buy."

Gilli asked what he and his companions wished to buy. Hoskuld said he
should like to buy some bondswoman, "if you have one to sell."

Gilli answers: "There, you mean to give me trouble by this, in asking
for things you don't expect me to have in stock; but it is not sure that
that follows."

Hoskuld then saw that right across the booth there was drawn a curtain;
and Gilli then lifted the curtain, and Hoskuld saw that there were
twelve women seated behind the curtain. So Gilli said that Hoskuld
should come on and have a look, if he would care to buy any of these
women. Hoskuld did so. They sat all together across the booth. Hoskuld
looks carefully at these women. He saw a woman sitting out by the skirt
of the tent, and she was very ill-clad. Hoskuld thought, as far as he
could see, this woman was fair to look upon. Then said Hoskuld, "What is
the price of that woman if I should wish to buy her?"

Gilli replied, "Three silver pieces is what you must weigh me out for
her."

"It seems to me," said Hoskuld, "that you charge very highly for this
bondswoman, for that is the price of three (such)."

Then Gilli said, "You speak truly, that I value her worth more than the
others. Choose any of the other eleven, and pay one mark of silver for
her, this one being left in my possession."

Hoskuld said, "I must first see how much silver there is in the purse I
have on my belt," and he asked Gilli to take the scales while he
searched the purse.

Gilli then said, "On my side there shall be no guile in this matter;
for, as to the ways of this woman, there is a great drawback which I
wish, Hoskuld, that you know before we strike this bargain."

Hoskuld asked what it was.

Gilli replied, "The woman is dumb. I have tried in many ways to get her
to talk, but have never got a word out of her, and I feel quite sure
that this woman knows not how to speak."

Then, said Hoskuld, "Bring out the scales, and let us see how much the
purse I have got here may weigh."

Gilli did so, and now they weigh the silver, and there were just three
marks weighed. Then said Hoskuld, "Now the matter stands so that we can
close our bargain. You take the money for yourself, and I will take the
woman. I take it that you have behaved honestly in this affair, for, to
be sure, you had no mind to deceive me herein."

Hoskuld then went home to his booth. That same night Hoskuld went into
bed with her. The next morning when men got dressed, spake Hoskuld, "The
clothes Gilli the Rich gave you do not appear to be very grand, though
it is true that to him it is more of a task to dress twelve women than
it is to me to dress only one."

After that Hoskuld opened a chest, and took out some fine women's
clothes and gave them to her; and it was the saying of every one that
she looked very well when she was dressed. But when the rulers had there
talked matters over according as the law provided, this meeting was
broken up. Then Hoskuld went to see King Hakon, and greeted him
worthily, according to custom. The king cast a side glance at him, and
said, "We should have taken well your greeting, Hoskuld, even if you had
saluted us sooner; but so shall it be even now."
