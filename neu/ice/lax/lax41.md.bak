### Chapter XLI: Bolli returns to Iceland, A.D. 1000

Kalf Asgeirson went to see Kjartan and asks what he was minded to do
that summer. Kjartan said, "I have been thinking chiefly that we had
better take our ship to England, where there is a good market for
Christian men. But first I will go and see the king before I settle
this, for he did not seem pleased at my going on this journey when we
talked about it in the spring."

Then Kalf went away and Kjartan went to speak to the king, greeting him
courteously. The king received him most kindly, and asked what he and
his companion (Kalf) had been talking about. Kjartan told what they had
mostly in mind to do, but said that his errand to the king was to beg
leave to go on this journey. "As to that matter, I will give you your
choice, Kjartan. Either you will go to Iceland this summer, and bring
men to Christianity by force or by expedients; but if you think this too
difficult a journey, I will not let you go away on any account, for you
are much better suited to serve noble men than to turn here into a
chapman."

Kjartan chose rather to stay with the king than to go to Iceland and
preach the faith to them there, and said he could not be contending by
force against his own kindred. "Moreover, it would be more likely that
my father and other chiefs, who are near kinsmen of mine, would go
against thy will with all the less stubbornness the better beholden I am
under your power."

The king said, "This is chosen both wisely and as beseems a great man."

The king gave Kjartan a whole set of new clothes, all cut out of scarlet
cloth, and they suited him well; for people said that King Olaf and
Kjartan were of an even height when they went under measure. King Olaf
sent the court priest, named Thangbrand, to Iceland. He brought his ship
to Swanfirth, and stayed with Side- Hall all the winter at Wash-river,
and set forth the faith to people both with fair words and harsh
punishments. Thangbrand slew two men who went most against him. Hall
received the faith in the spring, and was baptized on the Saturday
before Easter, with all his household; then Gizor the White let himself
be baptized, so did Hjalti Skeggjason and many other chiefs, though
there were many more who spoke against it; and then dealings between
heathen men and Christians became scarcely free of danger. Sundry chiefs
even took counsel together to slay Thangbrand, as well as such men who
should stand up for him. Because of this turmoil Thangbrand ran away to
Norway, and came to meet King Olaf, and told him the tidings of what had
befallen in his journey, and said he thought Christianity would never
thrive in Iceland. The king was very wroth at this, and said that many
Icelanders would rue the day unless they came round to him. That summer
Hjalti Skeggjason was made an outlaw at the Thing for blaspheming the
gods. Runolf Ulfson, who lived in Dale, under Isles'-fells, the greatest
of chieftains, upheld the lawsuit against him. That summer Gizor left
Iceland and Hjalti with him, and they came to Norway, and went forthwith
to find King Olaf. The king gave them a good welcome, and said they had
taken a wise counsel; he bade them stay with him, and that offer they
took with thanks. Sverting, son of Runolf of Dale, had been in Norway
that winter, and was bound for Iceland in the summer. His ship was
floating beside the landing stage all ready, only waiting for a wind.
The king forbade him to go away, and said that no ships should go to
Iceland that summer. Sverting went to the king and pleaded his case, and
begged leave to go, and said it mattered a great deal to him, that they
should not have to unship their cargo again. The king spake, and then he
was wroth: "It is well for the son of a sacrificer to be where he likes
it worst."

So Sverting went no whither. That winter nothing to tell of befell. The
next summer the king sent Gizor and Hjalti Skeggjason to Iceland to
preach the faith anew, and kept four men back as hostages, Kjartan
Olafson, Halldor, the son of Gudmund the Mighty, Kolbein, son of Thord
the priest of Frey, and Sverting, son of Runolf of Dale. Bolli made up
his mind to journey with Gizor and Hjalti, and went to Kjartan, his
kinsman, and said, "I am now ready to depart; I should wait for you
through the next winter, if next summer you were more free to go away
than you are now. But I cannot help thinking that the king will on no
account let you go free. I also take it to be the truth that you
yourself call to mind but few of the things that afford pastime in
Iceland when you sit talking to Ingibjorg, the king's sister."

She was at the court of King Olaf, and the most beautiful of all the
women who were at that time in the land. Kjartan said, "Do not say such
things, but bear my greeting to both my kinsfolk and friends."
