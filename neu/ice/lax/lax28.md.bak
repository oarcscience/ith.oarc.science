### Chapter XXVIII: The Birth of Kjartan, Olaf's Son, A.D. 970

Olaf and Thorgerd had a son, and the boy was sprinkled with water and a
name was given him, Olaf letting him be called Kjartan after Myrkjartan
his mother's father. Bolli and Kjartan were much of an age. Olaf and
Thorgerd had still more children; three sons were called Steinthor and
Halldor and Helgi, and Hoskuld was the name of the youngest of Olaf's
sons. The daughters of Olaf and his wife were named Bergthora, Thorgerd,
and Thorbjorg. All their children were of goodly promise as they grew
up. At that time Holmgang Bersi lived in Saurby at an abode called
Tongue. He comes to see Olaf and asked for Halldor his son to foster.
Olaf agreed to this and Halldor went home with him, being then one
winter old. That summer Bersi fell ill, and lay in bed for a great part
of the summer. It is told how one day, when all the men were out
haymaking at Tongue and only they two, Bersi and Halldor, were left in
the house, Halldor lay in his cradle and the cradle fell over under the
boy and he fell out of it on to the floor, and Bersi could not get to
him. Then Bersi said this ditty:

     

         "Here we both lie

         In helpless plight,

         Halldor and I,

         Have no power left us;

         Old age afflicts me,

         Youth afflicts you,

         You will get better

         But I shall get worse."

Later on people came in and picked Halldor up off the floor, and Bersi
got better. Halldor was brought up there, and was a tall man and doughty
looking. Kjartan, Olaf's son, grew up at home at Herdholt. He was of all
men the goodliest of those who have been born in Iceland. He was
striking of countenance and fair of feature, he had the finest eyes of
any man, and was light of hue. He had a great deal of hair as fair as
silk, falling in curls; he was a big man, and strong, taking after his
mother's father Egil, or his uncle Thorolf. Kjartan was better
proportioned than any man, so that all wondered who saw him. He was
better skilled at arms than most men; he was a deft craftsman, and the
best swimmer of all men. In all deeds of strength he was far before
others, more gentle than any other man, and so engaging that every child
loved him; he was light of heart, and free with his money. Olaf loved
Kjartan best of all his children. Bolli, his foster- brother, was a
great man, he came next to Kjartan in all deeds of strength and prowess;
he was strong, and fair of face and courteous, and most warrior-like,
and a great dandy. The foster-brothers were very fond of each other.
Olaf now remained quietly in his home, and for a good many years.
