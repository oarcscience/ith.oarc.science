### Chapter XXXI: Thurid's Second Marriage, A.D. 982

Olaf Hoskuldson now stayed at home in much honour, as has been told
before. There was a man named Gudmund, who was the son of Solround, and
lived at Asbjornness north in Willowdale. He wooed Thurid, and got her
and a great deal of wealth with her. Thurid was a wise woman,
high-tempered and most stirring. Their sons were called Hall and Bardi
and Stein and Steingrim. Gudrun and Olof were their daughters.
Thorbjorg, Olaf's daughter, was of women the most beautiful and stout of
build. She was called Thorbjorg the Stout, and was married west in
Waterfirth to Asgeir, the son of Knott. He was a noble man. Their son
was Kjartan, father of Thorvald, the father of Thord, the father of
Snorri, the father of Thorvald, from whom is sprung the Waterfirth race.
Afterwards, Vermund, the son of Thorgrim, had Thorbjorg for wife. Their
daughter was Thorfinna, whom Thorstein Kuggason had for wife. Bergthora,
Olaf's daughter, was married west in Deepfirth to Thorhall the Priest.
Their son was Kjartan, father of Smith-Sturla, the foster son of Thord
Gilson. Olaf Peacock had many costly cattle. He had one very good ox
named Harri; it was dapple-grey of coat, and bigger than any other of
his cattle. It had four horns, two great and fair ones, the third stood
straight up, and a fourth stood out of its forehead, stretching down
below its eyes. It was with this that he opened the ice in winter to get
water. He scraped snow away to get at pasture like a horse. One very
hard winter he went from Herdholt into the Broadfirth-Dales to a place
that is now called Harristead. There he roamed through the winter with
sixteen other cattle, and got grazing for them all. In the spring he
returned to the home pastures, to the place now called Harri's- Lair in
Herdholt land. When Harri was eighteen winters old his ice-breaking horn
fell off, and that same autumn Olaf had him killed. The next night Olaf
dreamed that a woman came to him, and she was great and wrathful to look
at.

She spoke and said: "Are you asleep?" He said he was awake.

The woman said, "You are asleep, though it comes to the same thing as if
you were awake. You have had my son slain, and let him come to my hand
in a shapeless plight, and for this deed you shall see your son
bloodstained all over through my doing, and him I shall choose thereto
whom I know you would like to lose least of all."

After that she disappeared, and Olaf woke up and still thought he saw
the features of the woman. Olaf took the dream very much to heart, and
told it to his friends, but no one could read it to his liking. He
thought those spoke best about this matter who said that what had
appeared to him was only a dream or fancy.
