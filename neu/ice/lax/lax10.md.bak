### Chapter X: Of Viga Hrapp

Hrapp was the name of a man who lived in Salmon-river-Dale, on the north
bank of the river on the opposite side to Hoskuldstead, at the place
that was called later on Hrappstead, where there is now waste land.
Hrapp was the son of Sumarlid, and was called Fight-Hrapp. He was Scotch
on his father's side, and his mother's kin came from Sodor, where he was
brought up. He was a very big, strong man, and one not willing to give
in even in face of some odds; and for the reason that he was most
overbearing, and would never make good what he had misdone, he had had
to fly from West-over-the-sea, and had bought the land on which he
afterwards lived. His wife was named Vigdis, and was Hallstein's
daughter; and their son was named Sumarlid. Her brother was named
Thorstein Surt; he lived at Thorness, as has been written before.
Sumarlid was brought up there, and was a most promising young man.
Thorstein had been married, but by this time his wife was dead. He had
two daughters, one named Gudrid, and the other Osk. Thorkell trefill
married Gudrid, and they lived in Svignaskard. He was a great chieftain,
and a sage of wits; he was the son of Raudabjorn. Osk, Thorstein's
daughter, was given in marriage to a man of Broadfirth named Thorarin.
He was a valiant man, and very popular, and lived with Thorstein, his
father-in-law, who was sunk in age and much in need of their care. Hrapp
was disliked by most people, being overbearing to his neighbours; and at
times he would hint to them that theirs would be a heavy lot as
neighbours, if they held any other man for better than himself. All the
goodmen took one counsel, and went to Hoskuld and told him their
trouble. Hoskuld bade them tell him if Hrapp did any one any harm, "For
he shall not plunder me of men or money."
