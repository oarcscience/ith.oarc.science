### Chapter LXVI: Osvif and Gest die

That winter Osvif fell ill and died, and a great loss that was deemed,
for he had been the greatest of sages. Osvif was buried at Holyfell, for
Gudrun had had a church built there. That same winter Gest Oddleifson
fell ill, and as the sickness grew heavy on him, he called to him Thord
the Low, his son, and said, "My mind forebodes me that this sickness
will put an end to our living together. I wish my body to be carried to
Holyfell, for that will be the greatest place about these countrysides,
for I have often seen a light burning there."

Thereupon Gest died. The winter had been very cold, and there was much
ice about, and Broadfirth was laid under ice so far out that no ship
could get over it from Bardastrand. Gest's body lay in state two nights
at Hagi, and that very night there sprang up such a gale that all the
ice was drawn away from the land, and the next day the weather was fair
and still. Then Thord took a ship and put Gest's body on board, and went
south across Broad firth that day, and came in the evening to Holyfell.
Thord had a good welcome there, and stayed there through the night. In
the morning Gest's body was buried, and he and Osvif rested in one
grave. So Gest's soothsaying was fulfilled, in that now it was shorter
between them than at the time when one dwelt at Bardastrand and the
other in Saelingsdale. Thord the Low then went home as soon as he was
ready. That next night a wild storm arose, and drove the ice on to the
land again, where it held on long through the winter, so that there was
no going about in boats. Men thought this most marvellous, that the
weather had allowed Gest's body to be taken across when there was no
crossing before nor afterwards during the winter.
