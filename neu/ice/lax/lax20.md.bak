### Chapter XX: Melkorka's Marriage and Olaf the Peacock's Journey, A.D. 955

Hoskuld now remained quietly at home, and began now to sink into old
age, and his sons were now all grown up. Thorleik set up a household of
his own. at a place called Combness, and Hoskuld handed over to him his
portion. After that he married a woman named Gjaflaug, daughter of
Arnbjorn, son of Sleitu Bjorn, and Thorlaug, the daughter of Thord of
Headland. It was a noble match, Gjaflaug being a very beautiful and
high-minded woman. Thorleik was not an easy man to get on with, but was
most warlike. There was not much friendship between the kinsmen Hrut and
Thorleik. Bard Hoskuld's son stayed at home with his father, looked
after the household affairs no less than Hoskuld himself. The daughters
of Hoskuld do not have much to do with this story, yet men are known who
are descended from them. Olaf, Hoskuld's son, was now grown up, and was
the handsomest of all men that people ever set eyes on. He arrayed
himself always well, both as to clothes and weapons. Melkorka, Olaf's
mother, lived at Melkorkastead, as has been told before. Hoskuld looked
less after Melkorka's household ways than he used to do, saying that
that matter concerned Olaf, her son. Olaf said he would give her such
help as he had to offer her. Melkorka thought Hoskuld had done
shamefully by her, and makes up her mind to do something to him at which
he should not be over pleased. Thorbjorn Skrjup had chiefly had on hand
the care of Melkorka's household affairs. He had made her an offer of
marriage, after she had been an householder for but a little while, but
Melkorka refused him flatly. There was a ship up by Board-Ere in
Ramfirth, and Orn was the name of the captain. He was one of the
bodyguard of King Harald, Gunnhild's son.

Melkorka spoke to Olaf, her son, and said that she wished he should
journey abroad to find his noble relations, "For I have told the truth
that Myrkjartan is really my father, and he is king of the Irish, and it
would be easy for you betake you on board the ship that is now at
Board-Ere."

Olaf said, "I have spoken about it to my father, but he seemed to want
to have but little to do with it; and as to the manner of my
foster-father's money affairs, it so happens that his wealth is more in
land or cattle than in stores of Icelandic market goods."

Melkorka said, "I cannot bear your being called the son of a slave-woman
any longer; and if it stands in the way of the journey, that you think
you have not enough money, then I would rather go to the length even of
marrying Thorbjorn, if then you should be more willing than before to
betake yourself to the journey. For I think he will be willing to hand
out to you as much wares as you think you may need, if I give my consent
to his marrying me. Above all I look to this, that then Hoskuld will
like two things mightily ill when he comes to hear of them, namely, that
you have gone out of the land, and that I am married."

Olaf bade his mother follow her own counsel. After that Olaf talked to
Thorbjorn as to how he wished to borrow wares of him, and a great deal
thereof. Thorbjorn answered, "I will do it on one condition, and that is
that I shall marry Melkorka for them; it seems to me, you will be as
welcome to my money as to that which you have in your keep."

Olaf said that this should then be settled; whereupon they talked
between them of such matters as seemed needful, but all these things
they agreed should be kept quiet. Hoskuld wished Olaf to ride with him
to the Thing. Olaf said he could not do that on account of household
affairs, as he also wanted to fence off a grazing paddock for lambs by
Salmon River. Hoskuld was very pleased that he should busy himself with
the homestead. Then Hoskuld rode to the Thing; but at Lambstead a
wedding feast was arrayed, and Olaf settled the agreement alone. Olaf
took out of the undivided estate thirty hundred ells' worth of wares,
and should pay no money for them. (1) Bard, Hoskuld's son, was at the
wedding, and was a party with them to all these doings. When the feast
was ended Olaf rode off to the ship, and found Orn the captain, and took
berth with him.

Before Olaf and Melkorka parted she gave him a great gold finger- ring,
and said, "This gift my father gave me for a teething gift, and I know
he will recognise it when he sees it." She also put into his hands a
knife and a belt, and bade him give them to her nurse: "I am sure she
will not doubt these tokens." And still further Melkorka spake, "I: have
fitted you out from home as best I know how, and taught you to speak
Irish, so that it will make no difference to you where you are brought
to shore in Ireland."

After that they parted. There arose forthwith a fair wind, when Olaf got
on board, and they sailed straightway out to sea.
