### Chapter XXII: Olaf the Peacock comes Home to Iceland, A.D. 957

Olaf Hoskuldson then went to the court of King Harald. The king gave him
a good welcome, but Gunnhild a much better. With many fair words they
begged him to stay with them, and Olaf agreed to it, and both he and Orn
entered the king's court. King Harald and Gunnhild set so great a store
by Olaf that no foreigner had ever been held in such honour by them.
Olaf gave to the king and Gunnhild many rare gifts, which he had got
west in Ireland. King Harald gave Olaf at Yule a set of clothes made out
of scarlet stuff. So now Olaf stayed there quietly all the winter. In
the spring, as it was wearing on, Olaf and the king had a conversation
together, and Olaf begged the king's leave to go to Iceland in the
summer, "For I have noble kinsfolk there the I want to go and see."

The king answered, "It would be more to my mind that you should settle
down with us, and take whatever position in our service you like best
yourself."

Olaf thanked the king for all the honour he was offering him, but said
he wished very much to go to Iceland, if that was not against the king's
will. The king answered, "Nothing shall be done in this in an unfriendly
manner to you, Olaf. You shall go out to Iceland in the summer, for I
see you have set your heart on it; but neither trouble nor toil shall
you have over your preparations, for I will see after all that," and
thereupon they part talking.

King Harald had a ship launched in the spring; it was a merchant ship,
both great and good. This ship the king ordered to be laden with wood,
and fitted out with full rigging. When the ship was ready the king had
Olaf called to him, and said, "This ship shall be your own, Olaf, for I
should not like you to start from Norway this summer as a passenger in
any one else's ship."

Olaf thanked the king in fair words for his generosity. After that Olaf
got ready for his journey; and when he was ready and a fair wind arose,
Olaf sailed out to sea, and King Harald and he parted with the greatest
affection. That summer Olaf had a good voyage. He brought his ship into
Ram-firth, to Board-Ere. The arrival of the ship was soon heard of, and
also who the captain was. Hoskuld heard of the arrival of Olaf, his son,
and was very much pleased, and rode forthwith north to Hrutafjord with
some men, and there was a joyful meeting between the father and son.
Hoskuld invited Olaf to come to him, and Olaf said he would agree to
that; so he set up his ship, but his goods were brought (on horseback)
from the north. And when this business was over Olaf himself rode with
twelve men home to Hoskuldstead, and Hoskuld greeted his son joyfully,
and his brothers also received him fondly, as well as all his kinsfolk;
but between Olaf and Bard was love the fondest. Olaf became very
renowned for this journey; and now was proclaimed the descent of Olaf,
that he was the daughter's son of Myrkjartan, king of Ireland. The news
of this spread over the land, as well as of the honour that mighty men,
whom he had gone to see, had bestowed on him. Melkorka came soon to see
Olaf, her son, and Olaf greeted her with great joy. She asked about many
things in Ireland, first of her father and then of her other relations.
Olaf replied to everything she asked. Then she asked if her
foster-mother still lived. Olaf said she was still alive. Melkorka asked
why he had not tried to give her the pleasure of bringing her over to
Iceland.

Olaf replied, "They would not allow me to bring your foster- mother out
of Ireland, mother."

"That may be so," she replied, and it could be seen that this she took
much to heart. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had one son, who was named Lambi.
He was a tall man and strong, like his father in looks as well as in
temper. When Olaf had been in Iceland a month, and spring came on,
father and son took counsel together. "I will, Olaf," said Hoskuld,
"that a match should be sought for you, and that then you should take
over the house of your foster- father at Goddistead, where still there
are great means stored up, and that then you should look after the
affairs of that household under my guidance."

Olaf answered, "Little have I set my mind on that sort of thing
hitherto; besides, I do not know where that woman lives whom to marry
would mean any great good luck to me. You must know I shall look high
for a wife. But I see clearly that you would not have broached this
matter till you had made up your mind as to where it was to end."

Hoskuld said, "You guess that right. There is a man named Egil. He is
Skallagrim's son. He lives at Borg, in Borgarfjord. This Egil has a
daughter who is called Thorgerd, and she is the woman I have made up my
mind to woo on your behalf, for she is the very best match in all
Borgarfjord, and even if one went further afield. Moreover, it is to be
looked for, that an alliance with the Mere-men would mean more power to
you."

Olaf answered, "Herein I shall trust to your foresight, for if this
match were to come off it would be altogether to my liking. But this you
must bear in mind, father, that should this matter be set forth, and not
come off, I should take it very ill."

Hoskuld answered, "I think I shall venture to bring the matter about."

Olaf bade him do as he liked. Now time wears on towards the Thing.
Hoskuld prepares his journey from home with a crowded company, and Olaf,
his son, also accompanies him on the journey. They set up their booth. A
great many people were there. Egil Skallagrim's son was at the Thing.
Every one who saw Olaf remarked what a handsome man he was, and how
noble his bearing, well arrayed as he was as to weapons and clothes.
