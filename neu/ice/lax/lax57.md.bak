### Chapter LVII: About Thorgils Hallason, A.D. 1018

There was a man named Thorgils Hallason; he was known by his mother's
name, as she lived longer than his father, whose name was Snorri, son of
Alf o' Dales. Halla, Thorgil's mother, was daughter of Gest Oddleifson.
Thorgils lived in Horddale at a place called Tongue. Thorgi1s was a man
great and goodly of body, the greatest swaggerer, and was spoken of as
one of no fairness in dealings with men. Between him and Snorri the
Priest there was often little love lost, for Snorri found Thorgils both
meddlesome and flaunting of demeanour. Thorgils would get up many
errands on which to go west into the country side, and always came to
Holyfell offering Gudrun to look after her affairs, but she only took
the matter quietly and made but little of it all. Thorgils asked for her
son Thorleik to go home with him, and he stayed for the most part at
Tongue and learnt law from Thorgils, for he was a man most skilled in
lawcraft. At that time Thorkell Eyjolfson was busy in trading journeys;
he was a most renowned man, and of high birth, and withal a great friend
of Snorri the Priest. He would always be staying with Thorstein
Kuggison, his kinsman, when he was out here (in Iceland). Now, one time
when Thorkell had a ship standing up in Vadill, on Bardastrand, it
befell, in Burgfirth, that the son of Eid of Ridge was killed by the
sons of Helga from Kropp. Grim was the name of the man who had done the
manslaughter, and that of his brother was Njal, who was drowned in
Whiteriver; a little later on Grim was outlawed to the woods because of
the manslaughter, and he lay out in the mountains whilst he was under
the award of outlawry. He was a great man and strong. Eid was then very
old when this happened, so the case was not followed up. People blamed
Thorkell very much that he did not see matters righted. The next spring
when Thorkell had got his ship ready he went south across
Broadfirth-country, and got a horse there and rode alone, not stopping
in his journey till he got as far as Ridge, to Eid, his kinsman. Eid
took him in joyfully. Thorkell told him his errand, how that he would go
and find Grim his outlaw, and asked Eid if he knew at all where his lair
was.

Eid answered, "I am nowise eager for this; it seems to me you have much
to risk as to how the journey may speed, seeing that you will have to
deal with a man of Hel's strength, such as Grim. But if you will go,
then start with many men, so that you may have it all your own way."

"That to me is no prowess," said Thorkell, "to draw together a great
company against one man. But what 1 wish is, that you would lend me the
sword Skofnung, for then I ween I shall be able to overcome a mere
runagate, be he never so mighty a man of his hands."

"You must have your way in this," said Eid, "but it will not come to me
unawares, if, some day, you should come to rue this wilfulness. But
inasmuch as you will have it that you are doing this for my sake, what
you ask for shall not be withheld, for I think Skofnung well bestowed if
you bear it. But the nature of the sword is such that the sun must not
shine upon its hilt, nor must it be drawn if a woman should be near. If
a man be wounded by the sword the hurt may not be healed, unless the
healing-stone that goes with the sword be rubbed there on."

Thorkell said he would pay careful heed to this, and takes over the
sword, asking Eid to point out to him the way to where Grim might have
his lair. Eid said he was most minded to think that Grim had his lair
north on Twodays-Heath by the Fishwaters. Then Thorkell rode northward
upon the heath the way which Eid did point out to him, and when he had
got a long way onward over the heath he saw near some great water a hut,
and makes his way for it.
