### Chapter XL: Kjartan and Bolli Voyage to Norway, A.D. 999

Asgeir was the name of a man, he was called Eider-drake. He lived at
Asgeir's-river, in Willowdale; he was the son of Audun Skokul; he was
the first of his kinsmen who came to Iceland; he took to himself
Willowdale. Another son of Audun was named Thorgrim Hoaryhead; he was
the father of Asmund, the father of Gretter. Asgeir Eider-drake had five
children; one of his sons was called Audun, father of Asgeir, father of
Audun, father of Egil, who had for wife Ulfeid, the daughter of Eyjolf
the Lame; their son was Eyjolf, who was slain at the All Thing. Another
of Asgeir's sons was named Thorvald; his daughter was Dalla whom Bishop
Isleif had for wife; their son was Gizor, the bishop. A third son of
Asgeir was named Kalf. All Asgeir's sons were hopeful men. Kalf
Asgeirson was at that time out travelling, and was accounted of as the
worthiest of men. One of Asgeir's daughters was named Thurid; she
married Thorkell Kuggi, the son of Thord Yeller; their son was
Thorstein. Another of Asgeir's daughters was named Hrefna; she was the
fairest woman in those northern country-sides and very winsome. Asgeir
was a very mighty man. It is told how one time Kjartan Olafson went on a
journey south to Burgfirth. Nothing is told of his journey before he got
to Burg. There at that time lived Thorstein, Egil's son, his mother's
brother. Bolli was with him, for the foster-brothers loved each other so
dearly that neither thought he could enjoy himself if they were not
together. Thorstein received Kjartan with loving kindness, and said he
should be glad for his staying there a long rather than a short time. So
Kjartan stayed awhile at Burg. That summer there was a ship standing up
in Steam-river-Mouth, and this ship belonged to Kalf Asgeirson, who had
been staying through the winter with Thorstein, Egil's son. Kjartan told
Thorstein in secret that his chief errand to the south then was, that he
wished to buy the half of Kalf's ship, "for I have set my mind on going
abroad," and he asked Thorstein what sort of a man he thought Kalf was.

Thorstein said he thought he was a good man and true. "I can easily
understand," said Thorstein, "that you wish to see other men's ways of
life, and your journey will be remarkable in one way or another, and
your kinsfolk will be very anxious as to how the journey may speed for
you."

Kjartan said it would speed well enough. After that Kjartan bought a
half share in Kalf's ship, and they made up half shares partnership
between them; Kjartan was to come on board when ten weeks of summer had
passed. Kjartan was seen off with gifts on leaving Burg, and he and
Bolli then rode home. When Olaf heard of this arrangement he said he
thought Kjartan had made up his mind rather suddenly, but added that he
would not foreclose the matter. A little later Kjartan rode to Laugar to
tell Gudrun of his proposed journey abroad. Gudrun said, "You have
decided this very suddenly, Kjartan," and she let fall sundry words
about this, from which Kjartan got to understand that Gudrun was
displeased with it.

Kjartan said, "Do not let this displease you. I will do something else
that shall please you."

Gudrun said, "Be then a man of your word, for I shall speedily let you
know what I want." Kjartan bade her do so.

Gudrun said, "Then. I wish to go out with you this summer; if that comes
off, you would have made amends to me for this hasty resolve, for I do
not care for Iceland."

Kjartan said, "That cannot be, your brothers are unsettled yet, and your
father is old, and they would be bereft of all care if you went out of
the land; so you wait for me three winters."

Gudrun said she would promise nothing as to that matter, and , each was
at variance with the other, and there-with they parted. Kjartan rode
home. Olaf rode to the Thing that summer, and Kjartan rode with his
father from the west out of Herdholt, and they parted at
North-river-Dale. From thence Kjartan rode to his ship, and his kinsman
Bolli went along with him. There were ten Icelanders altogether who went
with Kjartan on this journey, and none would part with him for the sake
of the love they bore him. So with this following Kjartan went to the
ship, and Kalf Asgeirson greeted them warmly. Kjartan and Bolli took a
great many goods with them abroad. They now got ready to start, and when
the wind blew they sailed out along Burg-firth with a light and good
breeze, and then out to sea. They had a good journey, and got to Norway
to the northwards and came into Thrandheim, and fell in with men there
and asked for tidings. They were told that change of lords over the land
had befallen, in that Earl Hakon had fallen and King Olaf Tryggvason had
come in, and all Norway had fallen under his power. King Olaf was
ordering a change of faith in Norway, and the people took to it most
unequally. Kjartan and his companions took their craft up to Nidaross.
At that time many Icelanders had come to Norway who were men of high
degree. There lay beside the landing-stage three ships, all owned by
Icelanders. One of the ships belonged to Brand the Bounteous, son of
Vermund Thorgrimson. And another ship belonged to Hallfred the
Trouble-Bard. The third ship belonged to two brothers, one named Bjarni,
and the other Thorhall; they were sons of Broad-river-Skeggi, out of
Fleetlithe in the east. All these men had wanted to go west to Iceland
that summer, but the king had forbidden all these ships to sail because
the Icelanders would not take the new faith that he was preaching. All
the Icelanders greeted Kjartan warmly, but especially Brand, as they had
known each other already before. The Icelanders now took counsel
together and came to an agreement among themselves that they would
refuse this faith that the king preached, and all the men previously
named bound themselves together to do this. Kjartan and his companions
brought their ship up to the landing stage and unloaded it and disposed
of their goods. King Olaf was then in the town. He heard of the coming
of the ship, and that men of great account were on board. It happened
one fair weather day in the autumn that the men went out of the town to
swim in the river Nid. Kjartan and his friends saw this. Then Kjartan
said to his companions that they should also go and disport themselves
that day. They did so. There was one man who was by much the best at
this sport. Kjartan asked Bolli if he felt willing to try swimming
against the towns man.

Bolli answered, "I don't think I am a match for him."

"I cannot think where your courage can now have got to," said Kjartan,
"so I shall go and try."

Bolli replied, "That you may do if you like."

Kjartan then plunges into the river and up to this man who was the best
swimmer and drags him forthwith under and keeps him down for awhile, and
then lets him go up again. And when they had been up for a long while,
this man suddenly clutches Kjartan and drags him under; and they keep
down for such a time as Kjartan thought quite long enough, when up they
come a second time. Not a word had either to say to the other. The third
time they went down together, and now they keep under for much the
longest time, and Kjartan now misdoubted him how this play would end,
and thought he had never before found himself in such a tight place; but
at last they come up and strike out for the bank. Then said the
townsman, "Who is this man?"

Kjartan told him his name. The townsman said, "You are very deft at
swimming. Are you as good at other deeds of prowess as at this?"

Kjartan answered rather coldly, "It was said when I was in Iceland that
the others kept pace with this one. But now this one is not worth much."

The townsman replied, "It makes some odds with whom you have had to do.
But why do you not ask me anything?"

Kjartan replied, "I do not want to know your name."

The townsman answered, "You are not only a stalwart man, but you bear
yourself very proudly as well, but none the less you shall know my name,
and with whom you have been having a swimming match. Here is Olaf the
king, the son of Tryggvi."

Kjartan answered nothing, but turned away forthwith without his cloak.
He had on a kirtle of red scarlet. The king was then well-nigh dressed;
he called to Kjartan and bade him not go away so soon. Kjartan turned
back, but rather slowly. The king then took a very good cloak off his
shoulders and gave it to Kjartan, saying he should not go back cloakless
to his companions. Kjartan thanked the king for the gift, and went to
his own men and showed them the cloak. His men were nowise pleased as
this, for they thought Kjartan had got too much into the king's power;
but matters went on quietly. The weather set in very hard that autumn,
and there was a great deal of frost, the season being cold. The heathen
men said it was not to be wondered at that the weather should be so bad;
"it is all because of the newfangled ways of the king and this new faith
that the gods are angry."

The Icelanders kept all together in the town during the winter, and
Kjartan took mostly the lead among them. On the weather taking a turn
for the better, many people came to the town at the summons of King
Olaf. Many people had become Christians in Thrandheim, yet there were a
great many more who withstood the king. One day the king had a meeting
out at Eyrar, and preached the new faith to men -- a long harangue and
telling. The people of Thrandheim had a whole host of men, and in turn
offered battle to the king. The king said they must know that he had had
greater things to cope with than fighting there with churls out of
Thrandheim. Then the goodmen lost heart and gave the whole case into the
king's power, and many people were baptized then and there. After that,
the meeting came to an end. That same evening the king sent men to the
lodgings of the Icelanders, and bade them get sure knowledge of what
they were saying. They did so. They heard much noise within. Then
Kjartan began to speak, and said to Bolli, "How far are you willing,
kinsman, to take this new faith the king preaches?"

"I certainly am not willing thereto," said Bolli, "for their faith seems
to me to be most feeble."

Kjartan said, "Did ye not think the king was holding out threats against
those who should be unwilling to submit to his will?"

Bolli answered, "It certainly seemed to me that he spoke out very
clearly that they would have to take exceeding hard treatment at his
hands."

"I will be forced under no one's thumb," said Kjartan, "while I have
power to stand up and wield my weapons. I think it most unmanly, too, to
be taken like a lamb in a fold or a fox in a trap. I think that is a
better thing to choose, if a man must die in any case, to do first some
such deed as shall be held aloft for a long time afterwards."

Bolli said, "What will you do?"

"I will not hide it from you," Kjartan replied; "I will burn the king in
his hall."

"There is nothing cowardly in that," said Bolli, "but this is not likely
to come to pass, as far as I can see. The king, I take it, is one of
great good luck and his guardian spirit mighty, and, besides, he has a
faithful guard watching both day and night."

Kjartan said that what most men failed in was daring, however valiant
they might otherwise be. Bolli said it was not so certain who would have
to be taunted for want of courage in the end. But here many men joined
in, saying this was but an idle talk. Now when the king's spies had
overheard this, they went away and told the king all that had been said.
The next morning the king wished to hold a meeting, and summoned all the
Icelanders to it; and when the meeting was opened the king stood up and
thanked men for coming, all those who were his friends and had taken the
new faith. Then he called to him for a parley the Icelanders. The king
asked them if they would be baptized, but they gave little reply to
that. The king said they were making for themselves the choice that
would answer the worst. "But, by the way, who of you thought it the best
thing to do to burn me in my hall?"

Then Kjartan answered, "You no doubt think that he who did say it would
not have the pluck to confess it; but here you can see him."

"I can indeed see you," said the king, "man of no small counsels, but it
is not fated for you to stand over my head, done to death by you; and
you have done quite enough that you should be prevented making a vow to
burn more kings in their houses: yet, for the reason of being taught
better things than you know and because I do not know whether your heart
was in your speech, and that you have bravely acknowledged it, I will
not take your life. It may also be that you follow the faith the better
the more outspoken you are against it; and I can also see this, that on
the day you let yourself be baptized of your own free will, several
ships' crews will on that day also take the faith. And I think it likely
to happen that your relations and friends will give much heed to what
you speak to them when you return to Iceland. And it is in my mind that
you, Kjartan, will have a better faith when you return from Norway than
you had when you came hither. Go now in peace and safety wheresoever you
like from the meeting. For the time being you shall not be tormented
into Christianity, for God says that He wills that no one shall come to
Him unwillingly."

Good cheer was made at the king's speech, though mostly from the
Christian men; but the heathen left it to Kjartan to answer as he liked.
Kjartan said, "We thank you, king, that you grant safe peace unto us,
and the way whereby you may most surely draw us to take the faith is, on
the one hand, to forgive us great offences, and on the other to speak in
this kindly manner on all matters, in spite of your this day having us
and all our concerns in your power even as it pleases you. Now, as for
myself, I shall receive the faith in Norway on that understanding alone
that I shall give some little worship to Thor the next winter when I get
back to Iceland."

Then the king said and smiled, "It may be seen from the mien of Kjartan
that he puts more trust in his own weapons and strength than in Thor and
Odin."

Then the meeting was broken up. After a while many men egged the king on
to force Kjartan and his followers to receive the faith, and thought it
unwise to have so many heathen men near about him. The king answered
wrathfully, and said he thought there were many Christians who were not
nearly so well-behaved as was Kjartan or his company either, "and for
such one would have long to wait."

The; king caused many profitable things to be done that winter; he had a
church built and the market-town greatly enlarged. This church was
finished at Christmas. Then Kjartan said they should go so near the
church that they might see the ceremonies of this faith the Christians
followed; and many fell in, saying that would be right good pastime.
Kjartan with his following and Bolli went to the church; in that train
was also Hallfred and many other Icelanders. The king preached the faith
before the people, and spoke both long and tellingly, and the Christians
made good cheer at his speech. And when Kjartan and his company went
back to their chambers, a great deal of talk arose as to how they had
liked the looks of the king at this time, which Christians accounted of
as the next greatest festival. "For the king said, so that we might
hear, that this night was born the Lord, in whom we are now to believe,
if we do as the king bids us."

Kjartan says: "So greatly was I taken with the looks of the king when I
saw him for the first time, that I knew at once that he was a man of the
highest excellence, and that feeling has kept steadfast ever since, when
I have seen him at folk-meetings, and that but by much the best,
however, I liked the looks of him today; and I cannot help thinking that
the turn of our concerns hangs altogether on our believing Him to be the
true God in whom the king bids us to believe, and the king cannot by any
means be more eager in wishing that I take this faith than I am to let
myself be baptized. The only thing that puts off my going straightway to
see the king now is that the day is far spent, and the king, I take it,
is now at table; but that day will be delayed, on which we, companions,
will let ourselves all be baptized."

Bolli took to this kindly, and bade Kjartan alone look to their affairs.
The king had heard of the talk between Kjartan and his people before the
tables were cleared away, for he had his spies in every chamber of the
heathens. The king was very glad at this, and said, "In Kjartan has come
true the saw: 'High tides best for happy signs.'"

And the first thing the next morning early, when the king went to
church, Kjartan met him in the street with a great company of men.
Kjartan greeted the king with great cheerfulness, and said he had a
pressing errand with him. The king took his greeting well, and said he
had had a thoroughly clear news as to what his errand must be, "and that
matter will be easily settled by you."

Kjartan begged they should not delay fetching the water, and said that a
great deal would be needed. The king answered and smiled. "Yes,
Kjartan," says he, "on this matter I do not think your eager-mindedness
would part us, not even if you put the price higher still."

After that Kjartan and Bolli were baptized and all their crew, and a
multitude of other men as well. This was on the second day of Yule
before Holy Service. After that the king invited Kjartan to his Yule
feast with Bolli his kinsman. It is the tale of most men that Kjartan on
the day he laid aside his white baptismal robes became a liegeman of the
king's, he and Bolli both. Hallfled was not baptized that day, for he
made it a point that the king himself should be his godfather, so the
king put it off till the next day. Kjartan and Bolli stayed with Olaf
the king the rest of the winter. The king held Kjartan before all other
men for the sake of his race and manly prowess, and it is by all people
said that Kjartan was so winsome that he had not a single enemy within
the court. Every one said that there had never before come from Iceland
such a man as Kjartan. Bolli was also one of the most stalwart of men,
and was held in high esteem by all good men. The winter now passes away,
and, as spring came on, men got ready for their journeys, each as he had
a mind to.
