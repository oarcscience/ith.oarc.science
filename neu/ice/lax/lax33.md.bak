### Chapter XXXIII: Of Gest Oddleifson and Gudrun's Dreams

Gest Oddleifson lived west at Bardastrand, at Hagi. He was a great
chieftain and a sage; was foreseeing in many things and in good
friendship with all the great men, and many came to him for counsel. He
rode every summer to the Thing, and always would put up at Hol. One time
it so happened once more that Gest rode to the Thing and was a guest at
Hol. He got ready to leave early in the morning, for the journey was a
long one and he meant to get to Thickshaw in the evening to Armod, his
brother-in-law's, who had for wife Thorunn, a sister of Gest's. Their
sons were Ornolf and Halldor. Gest rode all that day from Saurby and
came to the Saelingsdale spring, and tarried there for a while. Gudrun
came to the spring and greeted her relative, Gest, warmly. Gest gave her
a good welcome, and they began to talk together, both being wise and of
ready speech. And as the day was wearing on, Gudrun said, "I wish,
cousin, you would ride home with us with all your followers, for it is
the wish of my father, though he gave me the honour of bearing the
message, and told me to say that he would wish you to come and stay with
us every time you rode to or from the west."

Gest received the message well, and thought it a very manly offer, but
said he must ride on now as he had purposed. Gudrun said, "I have dreamt
many dreams this winter; but four of the dreams do trouble my mind much,
and no man has been able to explain them as I like, and yet I ask not
for any favourable interpretation of them."

Gest said, "Tell me your dreams, it may be that I can make something of
them."

Gudrun said, "I thought I stood out of doors by a certain brook, and I
had a crooked coif on my head, and I thought it misfitted me, and I
wished to alter the coif, and many people told me I should not do so,
but I did not listen to them, and I tore the hood from my head, and cast
it into the brook, and that was the end of that dream."

Then Gudrun said again, "This is the next dream. I thought I stood near
some water, and I thought there was a silver ring on my arm. I thought
it was my own, and that it fitted me exceeding well. I thought it was a
most precious thing, and long I wished to keep it. But when I was least
aware of it, the ring slipped off my arm and into the water, and nothing
more did I see of it afterwards. I felt this loss much more than it was
likely I should ever feel the loss of a mere keepsake. Then I awoke."

Gest answered this alone: "No lesser a dream is that one."

Gudrun still spoke: "This is the third dream. I thought I had a gold
ring on my hand, which I thought belonged to me, and I thought my loss
was now made good again. And the thought entered my mind that I would
keep this ring longer than the first, but it did not seem to me that
this keepsake suited me better than the former at anything like the rate
that gold is more precious than silver. Then I thought I fell, and tried
to steady myself with my hand, but then the gold ring struck on a
certain stone and broke in two, and the two pieces bled. What I had to
bear after this felt more like grief than regret for a loss. And it
struck me now that there must have been some flaw in the ring, and when
I looked at the pieces I thought I saw sundry more flaws in them; yet I
had a feeling that if I had taken better care of it, it might still have
been whole; and this dream was no longer."

Gest said, "The dreams are not waning."

Then said Gudrun, "This is my fourth dream. I thought I had a helm of
gold upon my head, set with many precious stones. And I thought this
precious thing belonged to me, but what I chiefly found fault with was
that it was rather too heavy, and I could scarcely bear it, so that I
carried my head on one side; yet I did not blame the helm for this, nor
had I any mind to part with it. Yet the helm tumbled from my head out
into Hvammfirth, and after that I awoke. Now I have told you all my
dreams."

Gest answered, "I clearly see what these dreams betoken; but you will
find my unravelling savouring much of sameness, for I must read them all
nearly in the same way. You will have four husbands, and it misdoubts me
when you are married to the first it will be no love match. Inasmuch as
you thought you had a great coif on your head and thought it ill
fitting, that shows you will love him but little. And whereas you took
it off your head and cast it into the water, that shows that you will
leave him. For that, men say, is 'cast on to the sea', when a man loses
what is his own, and gets nothing in return for it."

And still Gest spake: "Your second dream was that you thought you had a
silver ring on your arm, and that shows you will marry a nobleman whom
you will love much, but enjoy him for but a short time, and I should not
wonder if you lose him by drowning. That is all I have to tell of that
dream. And in the third dream you thought you had a gold ring on your
hand; that shows you will have a third husband; he will not excel the
former at the rate that you deemed this metal more rare and precious
than silver; but my mind forebodes me that by that time a change of
faith will have come about, and your husband will have taken the faith
which we are minded to think is the more exalted. And whereas you
thought the ring broke in two through some misdeed of yours, and blood
came from the two pieces, that shows that this husband of yours will be
slain, and then you will think you see for the first time clearly all
the flaws of that match."

Still Gest went on to say: "This is your fourth dream, that you thought
you had a helm on your head, of gold set with precious stones, and that
it was a heavy one for you to bear. This shows you will have a fourth
husband who will be the greatest nobleman (of the four), and will bear
somewhat a helm of awe over you. And whereas you thought it tumbled out
into Hvammfirth, it shows that that same firth will be in his way on the
last day of his life. And now I go no further with this dream."

Gudrun sat with her cheeks blood red whilst the dreams were unravelled,
but said not a word till Gest came to the end of his speech. Then said
Gudrun, "You would have fairer prophecies in this matter if my delivery
of it into your hands had warranted; have my thanks all the same for
unravelling the dreams. But it is a fearful thing to think of, if all
this is to come to pass as you say."

Gudrun then begged Gest would stay there the day out, and said that he
and Osvif would have many wise things to say between them. He answered,
"I must ride on now as I have made up my mind. But bring your father my
greeting and tell him also these my words, that the day will come when
there will be a shorter distance between Osvif's and my dwellings, and
then we may talk at ease, if then we are allowed to converse together."

Then Gudrun went home and Gest rode away. Gest met a servant of Olaf's
by the homefield fence, who invited Gest to Herdholt, at the bidding of
Olaf. Gest said he would go and see Olaf during the day, but would stay
(the night) at Thickshaw. The servant returned home and told Olaf so.
Olaf had his horse brought and rode with several men out to meet Gest.
He and Gest met up at Lea-river. Olaf greeted him well and asked him in
with all his followers. Gest thanked him for the invitation, and said he
would ride up to the homestead and have a look and see how he was
housed, but he must stay with Armod. Gest tarried but a little while,
yet he saw over the homestead and admired it and said, "No money has
been spared for this place."

Olaf rode away with Gest to the Salmon-river. The foster-brothers had
been swimming there during the day, and at this sport the sons of Olaf
mostly took the lead. There were many other young men from the other
houses swimming too. Kjartan and Bolli leapt out of the water as the
company rode down and were nearly dressed when Olaf and Gest came up to
them. Gest looked at these young men for a while, and told Olaf where
Kjartan was sitting as well as Bolli, and then Gest pointed his spear
shaft to each one of Olaf's sons and named by name all of them that were
there. But there were many other handsome young men there who had just
left off swimming and sat on the riverbank with Kjartan and Bolli. Gest
said he did not discover the family features of Olaf in any of these
young men. Then said Olaf: "Never is there too much said about your
wits, Gest, knowing, as you do, men you have never seen before. Now I
wish you to tell me which of those young men will be the mightiest man."

Gest replied, "That will fall out much in keeping with your own love,
for Kjartan will be the most highly accounted of so long as he lives."

Then Gest smote his horse and rode away. A little while after Thord the
Low rode up to his side, and said, "What has now come to pass, father,
that you are shedding tears?"

Gest answered, "It is needless to tell it, yet I am loath to keep
silence on matters that will happen in your own days. To me it will not
come unawares if Bolli one day should have at his feet the head of
Kjartan slain, and should by the deed bring about his own death, and
this is an ill thing to know of such sterling men."

Then they rode on to the Thing, and it was an uneventful meeting.
