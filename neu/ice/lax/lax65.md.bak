### Chapter LXV: Of Gudrun's Deceit

After these deeds Thorgils and his band rode away over the neck to
Reekdale, where they declared these manslaughters on their hands. Then
they rode the same way westward as they had ridden from the west, and
did not stop their journey till they came to Hord-Dale. They now told
the tidings of what had happened in their journey, which became most
famous, for it was thought a great deed to have felled such a hero as
was Helgi. Thorgils thanked his men well for the journey, and the sons
of Bolli did the same. And now the men part who had been in Thorgils'
train; Lambi rode west to Salmon-river-Dale, and came first to Herdholt
and told his kinsmen most carefully the tidings of what had happened in
Skorradale. They were very ill-pleased with his journey and laid heavy
reproaches upon him, saying he had shown himself much more of the stock
of Thorbjorn "Skrjup" than of that of Myrkjartan, the Irish king. Lambi
was very angry at their talk, and said they knew but little of good
manners in overwhelming him with reproaches, "for I have dragged you out
of death," says he. After that they exchanged but few words, for both
sides were yet more fulfilled of ill-will than before. Lambi now rode
home to his manor. Thorgils Hallason rode out to Holyfell, and with him
the sons of Gudrun and his foster-brothers Halldor and Ornolf. They came
late in the evening to Holyfell, when all men were in bed. Gudrun rose
up and bade the household get up and wait upon them. She went into the
guest-chamber and greeted Thorgils and all the others, and asked for
tidings. Thorgils returned Gudrun's greeting; he had laid aside his
cloak and his weapons as well, and sat then up against the pillars.
Thorgils had on a red-brown kirtle, and had round his waist a broad
silver belt. Gudrun sat down on the bench by him. Then Thorgils said
this stave --

     

         "To Helgi's home a raid we led,

         Gave ravens corpse-repast to swallow,

         We dyed shield-wands (1) with blood all red,

         As Thorleik's lead our band did follow.

         And at our hands there perished three

         Keen helmet-stems, (2) accounted truly

         As worthies of the folk -- and we

         Claim Bolli now's avenged full duly."

Gudrun asked them most carefully for the tidings of what had happened on
their journey. Thorgils told her all she wished. Gudrun said the journey
had been most stirringly carried out, and bade them have her thanks for
it. After that food was set before them, and after they had eaten they
were shown to bed, and slept the rest of the night.

The next day Thorgils went to talk to Gudrun, and said, "Now the matter
stands thus, as you know, Gudrun, that I have brought to an end the
journey you bade me undertake, and I must claim that, in a full manly
wise, that matter has been turned out of hand; you will also call to
mind what you promised me in return, and I think I am now entitled to
that prize."

Then Gudrun said, "It is not such a long time since we last talked
together that I should have forgotten what we said, and my only aim is
to hold to all I agreed to as concerning you. Or what does your mind
tell you as to how matters were bespoken between us?"

Thorgils said she must remember that, and Gudrun answered, "I think I
said that of men within this land I would marry none but you; or have
you aught to say against that?"

Thorgils said she was right. "That is well then," said Gudrun, "that our
memory should be one and the same on this matter. And I will not put it
off from you any longer, that I am minded to think tint it is not fated
to me to be your wife. Yet I deem that I fulfil to you all uttered
words, though I marry Thorkell Eyjolfson, who at present is not in this
land."

Then Thorgils said, and flushed up very much, "Clearly I do see from
whence that chill wave comes running, and from thence cold counsels have
always come to me. I know that this is the counsel of Snorri the
Priest."

Thorgils sprang up from this talk and was very angry, and went to his
followers and said he would ride away. Thorleik disliked very much that
things should have taken such a turn as to go against Thorgils' will;
but Bolli was at one with his mother's will herein. Gudrun said she
would give Thorgils some good gifts and soften him by that means, but
Thorleik said that would be of no use, "for Thorgils is far too
high-mettled a man to stoop to trifles in a matter of this sort."

Gudrun said in that case he must console himself as best he could at
home. After this Thorgils rode from Holyfell with his foster- brothers.
He got home to Tongue to his manor mightily ill at ease over his lot.
