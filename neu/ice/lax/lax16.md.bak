### Chapter XVI: Thord becomes Olaf's Foster Father, A.D. 945

About this time Asgaut came home. Vigdis greeted him, and asked him what
sort of reception they had had at Sheepfell. He gave a good account of
it, and told her the words wherewith Thorolf had spoken out his mind.
She was very pleased at that. "And you, Asgaut," she said, "have done
your part well and faithfully, and you shall now know speedily what
wages you have worked for. I give you your freedom, so that from this
day forth you shall bear the title of a freeman. Therewith you shall
take the money that Thord took as the price for the head of Thorolf, my
kinsman, and now that money will be better bestowed."

Asgaut thanked her for her gift with fair words. The next summer Asgaut
took a berth in Day-Meal-Ness' and the ship put to sea, and they came in
for heavy gales, but not a long sea-voyage, and made Norway. After that
Asgaut went to Denmark and settled there, and was thought a valiant and
true man. And herewith comes to an end the tale of him. But after the
plot Thord Goddi had made up with Ingjald, the Sheepisles priest, when
they made up their minds to compass the death of Thorolf, Vigdis'
kinsman, she returned that deed with hatred, and divorced herself from
Thord Goddi, and went to her kinsfolk and told them the tale. Thord
Yeller was not pleased at this; yet matters went off quietly. Vigdis did
not take away with her from Goddistead any more goods than her own
heirlooms. The men of Hvamm let it out that they meant to have for
themselves one-half of the wealth that Thord was possessed of. And on
hearing this he becomes exceeding fainthearted, and rides forthwith to
see Hoskuld to tell him of his troubles.

Hoskuld said, "Times have been that you have been terror-struck, though
not having with such overwhelming odds to deal."

Then Thord offered Hoskuld money for his help, and said he would not
look at the matter with a niggard's eye. Hoskuld said, "This is clear,
that you will not by peaceful consent allow any man to have the
enjoyment of your wealth."

Answers Thord, "No, not quite that though; for I fain would that you
should take over all my goods. That being settled, I will ask to foster
your son Olaf, and leave him all my wealth after my days are done; for I
have no heir here in this land, and I think my means would be better
bestowed then, than that the kinsmen of Vigdis should grab it."

To this Hoskuld agreed, and had it bound by witnesses. This Melkorka
took heavily, deeming the fostering too low. Hoskuld said she ought not
to think that, "for Thord is an old man, and childless, and I wish Olaf
to have all his money after his day, but you can always go to see him at
any time you like."

Thereupon Thord took Olaf to him, seven years old, and loved him very
dearly. Hearing this, the men who had on hand the case against Thord
Goddi thought that now it would be even more difficult than before to
lay claim to the money. Hoskuld sent some handsome presents to Thord
Yeller, and bade him not be angry over this, seeing that in law they had
no claim on Thord's money, inasmuch as Vigdis had brought no true
charges against Thord, or any such as justified desertion by her.
"Moreover, Thord was no worse a man for casting about for counsel to rid
himself of a man that had been thrust upon his means, and was as beset
with guilt as a juniper bush is with prickles."

But when these words came to Thord from Hoskuld, and with them large
gifts of money, then Thord allowed himself to be pacified, and said he
thought the money was well placed that Hoskuld looked after, and took
the gifts; and all was quiet after that, but their friendship was rather
less warm than formerly. Olaf grew up with Thord, and became a great man
and strong. He was so handsome that his equal was not to be found, and
when he was twelve years old he rode to the Thing meeting, and men in
other country-sides looked upon it as a great errand to go, and to
wonder at the splendid way he was made. In keeping here-with was the
manner of Olaf's war-gear and raiment, and therefore he was easily
distinguished from all other men. Thord got on much better after Olaf
came to live with him. Hoskuld gave Olaf a nickname, and called him
Peacock, and the name stuck to him.
