### Chapter XVII: About Viga Hrapp's Ghost, A.D. 950

The tale is told of Hrapp that he became most violent in his behaviour,
and did his neighbours such harm that they could hardly hold their own
against him. But from the time that Olaf grew up Hrapp got no hold of
Thord. Hrapp had the same temper, but his powers waned, in that old age
was fast coming upon him, so that he had to lie in bed. Hrapp called
Vigdis, his wife, to him, and said, "I have never been of ailing health
in life," said he, "and it is therefore most likely that this illness
will put an end to our life together. Now, when I am dead, I wish my
grave to be dug in the doorway of my fire hall, and that I be put
thereinto, standing there in the doorway; then I shall be able to keep a
more searching eye on my dwelling."

After that Hrapp died, and all was done as he said, for Vigdis did not
dare do otherwise. And as evil as he had been to deal with in his life,
just so he was by a great deal more when he was dead, for he walked
again a great deal after he was dead. People said that he killed most of
his servants in his ghostly appearances. He caused a great deal of
trouble to those who lived near, and the house of Hrappstead became
deserted. Vigdis, Hrapp's wife, betook herself west to Thorstein Swart,
her brother. He took her and her goods in. And now things went as
before, in that men went to find Hoskuld, and told him all the troubles
that Hrapp was doing to them, and asked him to do something to put an
end to this. Hoskuld said this should be done, and he went with some men
to Hrappstead, and has Hrapp dug up, and taken away to a place near to
which cattle were least likely to roam or men to go about. After that
Hrapp's walkings- again abated somewhat. Sumarlid, Hrapp's son,
inherited all Hrapp's wealth, which was both great and goodly. Sumarlid
set up household at Hrappstead the next spring; but after he had kept
house there for a little time he was seized of frenzy, and died shortly
afterwards. Now it was the turn of his mother, Vigdis, to take there
alone all this wealth; but as she would not go to the estate of
Hrappstead, Thorstein Swart took all the wealth to himself to take care
of. Thorstein was by then rather old, though still one of the most
healthy and hearty of men.
