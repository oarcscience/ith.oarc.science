### Chapter I: Of Ketill Flatnose and his Descendants, 9th Century A.D.

Ketill Flatnose was the name of a man. He was the son of Bjorn the
Ungartered. Ketill was a mighty and high-born chieftain (hersir) in
Norway. He abode in Raumsdale, within the folkland of the Raumsdale
people, which lies between Southmere and Northmere. Ketill Flatnose had
for wife Yngvild, daughter of Ketill Wether, who was a man of exceeding
great worth. They had five children; one was named Bjorn the Eastman,
and another Helgi Bjolan. Thorunn the Horned was the name of one of
Ketill's daughters, who was the wife of Helgi the Lean, son of Eyvind
Eastman, and Rafarta, daughter of Kjarval, the Irish king. Unn "the
Deepminded" was another of Ketill's daughters, and was the wife of Olaf
the White, son of Ingjald, who was son of Frodi the Valiant, who was
slain by the Svertlings. Jorunn, "Men's Wit- breaker," was the name of
yet another of Ketill's daughters. She was the mother of Ketill the
Finn, who settled on land at Kirkby. His son was Asbjorn, father of
Thorstein, father of Surt, the father of Sighvat the Speaker-at-Law.
