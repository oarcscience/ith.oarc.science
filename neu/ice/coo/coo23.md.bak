### 5. THE CHILDREN OF LOKI

THE children of Loki and the witch Angerboda were not as the children of
men: they were formless as water, or air, or fire is formless, but it
was given to each of them to take on the form that was most like to
their own greed.

Now the Dwellers in Asgard knew that these powers of evil had been born
into the world and they thought it well that they should take on forms
and appear before them in Asgard. So they sent one to Jarnvid, the Iron
Wood, bidding Loki bring before the Gods the powers born of him and the
witch Angerboda. So Loki came into Asgard once more. And his offspring
took on forms and showed themselves to the Gods. The first, whose greed
was destruction,

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

showed himself as a fearful Wolf. Fenrir he was named. And the second,
whose greed was slow destruction, showed itself as a Serpent. Jörmungand
it was called. The third, whose greed was for withering of all life,
took on a form also. When the Gods saw it they were affrighted. For this
had the form of a woman, and one side of her was that of a living woman
and the other side of her was that of a corpse. Fear ran through Asgard
as this form was revealed and as the name that went with it, Hela, was
uttered.

Far out of sight of the Gods Hela was thrust. Odin took her and hurled
her down to the deeps that are below the world. He cast her down to
Niflheim, where she took to herself power over the nine regions. There,
in the place that is lowest of all, Hela reigns. Her hall is Elvidnir;
it is set round with high walls and it has barred gates; Precipice is
the threshold of that hall; Hunger is the table within it; Care is the
bed, and Burning Anguish is the hanging of the chamber.

Thor laid hold upon Jörmungand. He flung the serpent into the ocean that
engirdles the world. But in the depths of the ocean Jörmungand
flourished. It grew and grew until it encircled the whole world. And men
knew it as the Midgard Serpent.

Fenrir the Wolf might not be seized upon by any of the Æsir. Fearfully
he ranged through Asgard and they were only able to bring him to the
outer courts by promising to give him all the food he was able to eat.

The Æsir shrank from feeding Fenrir. But Tyr, the brave swordsman, was
willing to bring food to the Wolf's

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

lair. Every day he brought him huge provision and fed him with the point
of his sword. The Wolf grew and grew until he became monstrous and a
terror in the minds of the Dwellers in Asgard.

At last the Gods in council considered it and decided that Fenrir must
be bound. The chain that they would bind him with was called Laeding. In
their own smithy the Gods made it and its weight was greater than Thor's
hammer.

Not by force could the Gods get the fetter upon Fenrir, so they sent
Skirnir, the servant of Frey, to beguile the Wolf into letting it go
upon him. Skirnir came to his lair and stood near him, and he was
dwarfed by the Wolf's monstrous size.

"How great may thy strength be, Mighty One?" Skirnir asked. "Couldst
thou break this chain easily? The Gods would try thee."

In scorn Fenrir looked down on the fetter Skirnir dragged. In scorn he
stood still allowing Laeding to be placed upon him. Then, with an effort
that was the least part of his strength, he stretched himself and broke
the chain in two.

The Gods were dismayed. But they took more iron, and with greater fires
and mightier hammer blows they forged another fetter. Dromi, this one
was called, and it was half again as strong as Laeding was. Skirnir the
Venturesome brought it to the Wolf's lair, and in scorn Fenrir let the
mightier chain be placed upon him.

He shook himself and the chain held. Then his eyes

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

became fiery and he stretched himself with a growl and a snarl. Dromi
broke across, and Fenrir stood looking balefully at Skirnir.

The Gods saw that no chain they could forge would bind Fenrir and they
fell more and more into fear of him. They took council again and they
bethought them of the wonder-work the Dwarfs had made for them, the
spear Gungnir, the ship Skidbladnir, the hammer Miölnir. Could the
Dwarfs be got to make the fetter to bind Fenrir? If they would do it the
Gods would add to their domain.

Skirnir went down to Svartheim with the in sage from Asgard. The Dwarf
Chief swelled with pride to think that it was left to them to make the
fetter that would bind Fenrir.

"We Dwarfs can make a fetter that will bind the Wolf," he said. "Out of
six things we will make it."

"What are these six things?" Skirnir asked.

"The roots of stones, the breath of a fish, the beards of women, the
noise made by the footfalls of cats, the sinews of bears, the spittle of
a bird."

"I have never heard the noise made by a cat's footfall, nor have I seen
the roots of stones nor the beards of women. But use what things you
will, O Helper of the Gods.

The Chief brought his six things together and the Dwarfs in their smithy
worked for days and nights. They forged a fetter that was named
Gleipnir. Smooth and soft as a silken string it was. Skirnir brought it
to Asgard and put it into the hands of the Gods.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

Then a day came when the Gods said that once again they should try to
put a fetter upon Fenrir. But if he was to be bound they would bind him
far from Asgard. Lyngvi was an island that they often went to to make
sport, and they spoke of going there. Fenrir growled that he would go
with them. He came and he sported in his own terrible way. And then as
if it were to make more sport, one of the Æsir shook out the smooth cord
and showed it to Fenrir.

"It is stronger than you might think, Mighty One," they said. "Will you
not let it go upon you that we may see you break it?"

Fenrir out of his fiery eyes looked scorn upon them. "What fame would
there be for me," he said, "in breaking such a binding?"

They showed him that none in their company could break it slender as it
was. "Thou only art able to break it, Mighty One," they said.

"The cord is slender, but there may be an enchantment in it," Fenrir
said.

"Thou canst not break it, Fenrir, and we need not dread thee any more,"
the Gods said.

Then was the Wolf ravenous wroth, for he lived on the fear that he made
in the minds of the Gods. "I am loth to have this binding upon me," he
said, "but if one of the Æsir will put his hand in my mouth as a pledge
that I shall be freed of it, I will let ye put it on me."

The Gods looked wistfully on one another. It would be health to them all
to have Fenrir bound, but who would lose his band to have it done? One
and then another of the

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

sir stepped backward. But not Tyr, the brave swordsman. He stepped to
Fenrir and laid his left hand before those tremendous jaws.

"Not thy left hand--thy swordhand, O Tyr," growled Fenrir, and Tyr put
his swordhand into that terrible mouth.

Then the cord Gleipnir was put upon Fenrir. With fiery eyes he watched
the Gods bind him. When the binding was on him he stretched himself as
before. He stretched himself to a monstrous size but the binding did not
break off him. Then with fury he snapped his jaws upon the hand, and
Tyr's hand, the swordsman's hand, was torn off.

But Fenrir was bound. They fixed a mighty chain to the fetter, and they
passed the chain through a hole they bored through a great rock. The
monstrous Wolf made terrible efforts to break loose, but the rock and
the chain and the fetter held. Then seeing him secured, and to avenge
the loss of Tyr's hand, the Gods took Tyr's sword and drove it to the
hilt through his underjaw. Horribly the Wolf howled. Mightily the foam
flowed down from his jaws. That foam flowing made a river that is called
Von--a river of fury that flowed on until Ragnarök came, the Twilight of
the Gods.
