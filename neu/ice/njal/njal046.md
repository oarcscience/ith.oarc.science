# 46. OF GIZUR THE WHITE AND GEIR THE PRIEST

There was a man named Gizur the White; he was Teit's son; Kettlebjorn
the Old's son, of Mossfell. (1) Bishop Isleif was Gizur's son. Gizur the
White kept house at Mossfell, and was a great chief. That man is also
named in this story whose name was Geir the Priest; his mother was
Thorkatla, another daughter of Kettlebjorn the Old of Mossfell. Geir
kept house at Lithe. He and Gizur backed one another in every matter. At
that time Mord Valgard's son kept house at Hof on the Rangrivervales; he
was crafty and spiteful. Valgard his father was then abroad, but his
mother was dead. He was very envious of Gunnar of Lithend. He was
wealthy, so far as goods went, but had not many friends.
