<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">56. GUNNAR AND GEIR THE PRIEST STRIVE AT THE THING</H1>
<P>There was a man named Skapti. He was the son of Thorod (1). That father and son were great chiefs, and very well skilled in law. Thorod was thought to be rather crafty and guileful. They stood by Gizur the White in every quarrel.</P>
<P>As for the Lithemen and the dwellers by Rangriver, they came in a great body to the Thing. Gunnar was so beloved that all said with one voice that they would back him.</P>
<P>Now they all come to the Thing and fit up their booths. In company with Gizur the White were these chiefs: Skapti Thorod's son, Asgrim Ellidagrim's son, Oddi of Kidberg, and Halldor Ornolf's son.</P>
<P>Now one day men went to the Hill of Laws, and then Geir the Priest stood up and gave notice that he had a suit of manslaughter against Gunnar for the slaying of Otkell. Another suit of manslaughter he brought against Gunnar for the slaying of Halljborn the White; then, too, he went on in the same way as to the slaying of Audulf, and so, too, as to the slaying of Skamkell. Then, too, he laid a suit of manslaughter against Kolskegg for the slaying of Hallkell.</P>
<P>And when he had given due notice of all his suits of manslaughter it was said that he spoke well. He asked, too, in what Quarter court the suits lay, and in what house in the district the defendants dwelt. After that men went away from the Hill of Laws, and so the Thing goes on till the day when the courts were to be set to try suits. Then either side gathered their men together in great strength.</P>
<P>Geir the Priest and Gizur the White stood at the court of the men of Rangriver looking north, and Gunnar and Njal stood looking south towards the court.</P>
<P>Geir the Priest bade Gunnar to listen to his oath, and then he took the oath, and afterwards declared his suit.</P>
<P>Then he let men bear witness of the notice given by the suit; then he called upon the neighbours who were to form the inquest to take their seats; then he called on Gunnar to challenge the inquest; and then he called on the inquest to utter their finding. Then the neighbours who were summoned on the inquest went to the court and took witness, and said that there was a bar to their finding in the suit as to Audulf's slaying, because the next of kin who ought to follow it up was in Norway, and so they had nothing to do with that suit.</P>
<P>After that they uttered their finding in the suit as to Otkell, and brought in Gunnar as truly guilty of killing him.</P>
<P>Then Geir the Priest called on Gunnar for his defence, and took witness of all the steps in the suit which had been proved.</P>
<P>Then Gunnar, in his turn, called on Geir the Priest to listen to his oath, and to the defence which he was about to bring forward in the suit. Then he took the oath and said, "This defence I make to this suit, that I took witness and outlawed Otkell before my neighbours for that bloody wound which I got when Otkell gave me a hurt with his spur; but thee, Geir the Priest, I forbid by a lawful protest made before a priest, to pursue this suit, and so, too, I forbid the judges to hear it; and with this I make all the steps hitherto taken in this suit void and of none-effect. I forbid thee by a lawful protest, a full, fair, and binding protest, as I have a right to forbid thee by the common custom of the Thing and by the law of the land.</P>
<P>"Besides, I will tell thee something else which I mean to do," says Gunnar.</P>
<P>"What!" says Geir, "wilt thou challenge me to the island as thou art wont, and not bear the law?"</P>
<P>"Not that," says Gunnar; "I shall summon thee at the Hill of Laws for that thou calledst those men on the inquest who had no right to deal with Audulf's slaying, and I will declare thee for that guilty of outlawry."</P>
<P>Then Njal said, "Things must not take this turn, for the only end of it will be that this strife will be carried to the uttermost. Each of you, as it seems to me, has much on his side. There are some of these manslaughters, Gunnar, about which thou canst say nothing to hinder the court from finding thee guilty; but thou hast set on foot a suit against Geir, in which he, too, must be found guilty. Thou too, Geir the Priest, shalt know that this suit of outlawry which hangs over thee shall not fall to the ground if thou wilt not listen to my words."</P>
<P>Thorod the Priest said, "It seems to us as though the most peaceful way would be that a settlement and atonement were come to in the suit. But why sayest thou so little, Gizur the White?"</P>
<P>"It seems to me," says Gizur, "as though we shall need to have strong props for our suit; we may see, too, that Gunnar's friends stand near him, and so the best turn for us that things can take will be that good men and true should utter an award on the suit, if Gunnar so wills it."</P>
<P>"I have ever been willing to make matters up," says Gunnar; "and besides, ye have much wrong to follow up, but still I think I was hard driven to do as I did."</P>
<P>And now the end of those suits was, by the counsel of the wisest men, that all the suits were put to arbitration; six men were to make this award, and it was uttered there and then at the Thing.</P>
<P>The award was that Skamkell should be unatoned. The blood money for Otkell's death was to be set off against the hurt Gunnar got from the spur; and as for the rest of the manslaughters, they were paid for after the worth of the men, and Gunnar's kinsmen gave money so that all the fines might be paid up at the Thing.</P>
<P>Then Geir the Priest and Gizur the White went up and gave Gunnar pledges that they would keep the peace in good faith.</P>
<P>Gunnar rode home from the Thing, and thanked men for their help, and gave gifts to many, and got the greatest honour from the suit.</P>
<P>Now Gunnar sits at home in his honour.</P>
<P>ENDNOTES:</P>
<P>(1) Thorod's mother was Thorvor, she was daughter of Thormod Skapti's son, son of Oleif the Broad, son of Oliver Barncarle.</P>
