<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">40. GUNNAR AND NJAL MAKE PEACE ABOUT BRYNJOLF'S SLAYING</H1>
<P>Now these tidings come to the Thing, and Njal made them tell him the tale thrice, and then he said, "More men now become man- slayers than I weened."</P>
<P>Skarphedinn spoke, "That man, though, must have been twice fey," he says, "who lost his life by our foster-father's hand, who has never seen man's blood. And many would think that we brothers would sooner have done this deed with the turn of temper that we have."</P>
<P>"Scant space wilt thou have," says Njal, "ere the like befalls thee; but need will drive thee to it."</P>
<P>Then they went to meet Gunnar, and told him of the slaying. Gunnar spoke and said that was little man-scathe, "but yet he was a free man."</P>
<P>Njal offered to make peace at once, and Gunnar said yes, and he was to settle the terms himself. He made his award there and then, and laid it at one hundred in silver. Njal paid down the money on the spot, and they were at peace after that.</P>
