# 139. OF ASGRIM AND GUDMUND

And when they came into the booth then they saw where Gudmund the
Powerful sate and talked with Einar Conal's son, his foster- child; he
was a wise man.

Then they come before him, and Gudmund welcomed them very heartily, and
made them clear the booth for them, that they might all be able to sit
down.

Then they asked what tidings, and Asgrim said, "There is no need to
mutter what I have to say. We wish, Gudmund, to ask for thy steadfast
help."

"Have ye seen any other chiefs before?" said Gudmund.

They said they had been to see Skapti Thorod's son and Snorri the
Priest, and told him quietly how they had fared with each of them.

Then Gudmund said, "Last time I behaved badly and meanly to you. Then I
was stubborn, but now ye shall drive your bargain with me all the more
quickly because I was more stubborn then, and now I will go myself with
you to the court with all my Thing-men, and stand by you in all such
things as I can, and fight for you though this be needed, and lay down
my life for your lives. I will also pay Skapti out in this way, that
Thorstein Gape-mouth his son shall be in the battle on our side, for he
will not dare to do aught else than I will, since he has Jodisa my
daughter to wife, and then Skapti will try to part us."

They thanked him, and talked with him long and low afterwards, so that
no other men could hear.

Then Gudmund bade them not to go before the knees of any other chiefs,
for he said that would be little-hearted.

"We will now run the risk with the force that we have. Ye must go with
your weapons to all law-business, but not fight as things stand."

Then they went all of them home to their booths, and all this was at
first with few men's knowledge.

So now the Thing goes on.
