# 113. OF SNORRI THE PRIEST, AND HIS STOCK

There was a man named Snorri, who was surnamed the Priest. He dwelt at
Helgafell before Gudruna Oswif's daughter bought the land of him, and
dwelt there till she died of old age; but Snorri then went and dwelt at
Hvamsfirth on Saelingdale's tongue. Thorgrim was the name of Snorri's
father, and he was a son of Thorstein codcatcher (1). Snorri was a great
friend of Asgrim Ellidagrim's son, and he looked for help there also.
Snorri was the wisest and shrewdest of all these men in Iceland who had
not the gift of foresight. He was good to his friends, but grim to his
foes.

At that time there was a great riding to the Thing out of all the
Quarters, and men had many suits set on foot.

ENDNOTES:

\(1\) Thorstein Codcatcher was the son of Thorolf Mostrarskegg, the son
of Ornolf Fish-driver, but Ari the Wise ways he was the son of Thorgil
Reydarside. Thorolf Mostrarskegg had to wife Oska, the daughter of
Thorstein the Red. The mother of Thorgrim was named Thora, a daughter of
Oleif the Shy, the son of Thorstein the Red, the son of Oleif the White,
the son of Ingialld, the son of Helgi; but the mother of Ingialld was
Thora, a daughter of Sigurd Snake-eye, son of Ragnar Hairybreeks; but
the mother of Snorri the Priest was Thordisa, the daughter of Sur, and
the sister of Gisli.
