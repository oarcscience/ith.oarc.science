# 112. THE PEDIGREE OF GUDMUND THE POWERFUL

mighty chief, wealthy in goods; he had in his house a hundred hired
servants. He overbore in rank and weight all the chiefs in the north
country, so that some left their homesteads, but some he put to death,
and some gave up their priesthoods for his sake, and from him are come
the greatest part of all the picked and famous families in the land,
such as "the Pointdwellers" and the "Sturlungs" and the "Hvamdwellers,"
