# 149. OF KARI AND BJORN

Now Kari talks to Bjorn and says, "We shall ride east across the fell
and down into Skaptartongue, and fare stealthily over Flosi's country,
for I have it in my mind to get myself carried abroad east in
Alftafirth."

"This is a very riskful journey," said Bjorn, "and few would have the
heart to take it save thou and I."

"If thou backest Kari ill," said his housewife, "know this, that thou
shalt never come afterwards into my bed, and my kinsmen shall share our
goods between us."

"It is likelier, mistress," said he, "that thou wilt have to look out
for something else than this if thou hast a mind to part from me: for I
will bear my own witness to myself what a champion and daredevil I am
when weapons clash."

Now they rode that day east on the fell to the north of the Jokul, but
never on the highway, and so down into Skaptartongue, and above all the
homesteads to Skaptarwater, and led their horses into a dell, but they
themselves were on the look-out, and had so placed themselves that they
could not be seen.

Then Kari said to Bjorn, "What shall we do now if they ride down upon us
here from the fell?"

"Are there not but two things to be done," said Bjorn; "one to ride away
from them north under the crags, and so let them ride by us, or to wait
and see if any of them lag behind, and then to fall on them."

They talked much about this, and one while Bjorn was for flying as fast
as he could in every word he spoke, and at another for staying and
fighting it out with them, and Kari thought this the greatest sport.

The sons of Sigfus rode from their homes the same day that they had
named to Bjorn. They came to the Mark and knocked at the door there, and
wanted to see Bjorn; but his mistress went to the door and greeted them.
They asked at once for Bjorn, and she said he had ridden away down under
Eyjafell, and so east under Selialandsmull, and on east to Holt, "for he
has some money to call in thereabouts," she said.

They believed this, for they knew that Bjorn had money out at call
there.

After that they rode east on the fell, and did not stop before they came
to Skaptartongue, and so rode down along Skaptarwater, and baited their
horses just where Kari had thought they would. Then they split their
band. Kettle of the Mark rode east into Middleland, and eight men with
him, but the others laid them down to sleep, and were not ware of aught
until Kari and Bjorn came up to them. A little ness ran out there into
the river; into it Kari went and took his stand, and bade Bjorn stand
back to back with him, and not to put himself too forward, "but give me
all the help thou canst."

"Well," says Bjorn, "I never had it in my head that any man should stand
before me as a shield, but still as things are thou must have thy way;
but for all that, with my gift of wit and my swiftness I may be of some
use to thee, and not harmless to our foes."

Now they all rose up and ran at them, and Modolf Kettle's son was
quickest of them, and thrust at Kari with his spear. Kari had his shield
before him, and the blow fell on it, and the spear stuck fast in the
shield. Then Kari twists the shield so smartly, that the spear snapped
short off, and then he drew his sword and smote at Modolf; but Modolf
made a cut at him too, and Kari's sword fell on Modolf's hilt, and
glanced off it on to Modolf's wrist, and took the arm off, and down it
fell, and the sword too. Then Kari's sword passed on into Modolf's side,
and between his ribs, and so Modolf fell down and was dead on the spot.

Grani Gunnar's son snatched up a spear and hurled it at Kari, but Kari
thrust down his shield so hard that the point stood fast in the ground,
but with his left hand he caught the spear in the air, and hurled it
back at Grani, and caught up his shield again at once with his left
hand. Grani had his shield before him, and the spear came on the shield
and passed right through it, and into Grani's thigh just below the small
guts, and through the limb, and so on, pinning him to the ground, and he
could not get rid of the spear before his fellows drew him off it, and
carried him away on their shields, and laid him down in a dell.

There was a man who ran up to Kari's side, and meant to cut off his leg,
but Bjorn cut off that man's arm, and sprang back again behind Kari, and
they could not do him any hurt. Kari made a sweep at that same man with
his sword, and cut him asunder at the waist.

Then Lambi Sigfus' son rushed at Kari, and hewed at him with his sword.
Kari caught the blow sideways on his shield, and the sword would not
bite; then Kari thrust at Lambi with his sword just below the breast, so
that the point came out between his shoulders, and that was his
deathblow.

Then Thorstein Geirleif's son rushed at Kari, and thought to take him in
flank, but Kari caught sight of him, and swept at him with his sword
across the shoulders, so that the man was cleft asunder at the chine.

A little while after he gave Gunnar of Skal, a good man and true, his
deathblow. As for Bjorn, he had wounded three men who had tried to give
Kari wounds, and yet he was never so far forward that he was in the
least danger, nor was he wounded, nor was either of those companions
hurt in that fight, but all those that got away were wounded.

Then they ran for their horses, and galloped them off across
Skaptarwater as hard as they could, and they were so scared that they
stopped at no house, nor did they dare to stay and tell the tidings
anywhere.

Kari and Bjorn hooted and shouted after them as they galloped off. So
they rode east to Woodcombe, and did not draw bridle till they came to
Swinefell.

Flosi was not at home when they came thither, and that was why no hue
and cry was made thence after Kari.

This journey of theirs was thought most shameful by all men.

Kari rode to Skal, and gave notice of these manslayings as done by his
hand; there, too, he told them of the death of their master and five
others, and of Grani's wound, and said it would be better to bear him to
the house if he were to live.

Bjorn said he could not bear to slay him, though he said he was worthy
of death; but those who answered him said they were sure few had bitten
the dust before him. But Bjorn told them he had it now in his power to
make as many of the Sidemen as he chose bite the dust; to which they
said it was a bad look out.

Then Kari and Bjorn ride away from the house.
