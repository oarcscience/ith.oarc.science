# 43. NJAL AND GUNNAR MAKE PEACE FOR THE SLAYING OF THORD

But when the messenger came to the Thing to tell Gunnar of the slaying,
then Gunnar said, "This has happened ill, and no tidings could come to
my ears which I should think worse; but yet we will now go at once and
see Njal. I still hope he may take it well, though he be sorely tried."

So they went to see Njal, and called him to come out and talk to them.
He went out at once to meet Gunnar, and they talked, nor were there any
more men by at first than Kolskegg.

"Hard tidings have I to tell thee," says Gunnar; "the slaying of Thord
Freedmanson, and I wish to offer thee selfdoom for the slaying."

Njal held his peace some while, and then said, "That is well offered,
and I will take it; but yet it is to be looked for that I shall have
blame from my wife or from my sons for that, for it will mislike them
much; but still I will run the risk, for I know that I have to deal with
a good man and true; nor do I wish that any breach should arise in our
friendship on my part.

"Wilt thou let thy sons be by, pray?" says Gunnar.

"I will not," says Njal, "for they will not break the peace which I
make, but if they stand by while we make it they will not pull well
together with us."

"So it shall be," says Gunnar. "See thou to it alone."

Then they shook one another by the hand, and made peace well and
quickly.

Then Njal said, "The award that I make is two hundred in silver, and
that thou wilt think much."

"I do not think it too much," says Gunnar, and went home to his booth.

Njal's sons came home, and Skarphedinn asked whence that great sum of
money came, which his father held in his hand.

Njal said, "I tell you of your foster-father's Thord's slaying, and we
two, Gunnar and I, have now made peace in the matter, and he has paid an
atonement for him as for two men."

"Who slew him?" says Skarphedinn.

"Sigmund and Skiolld, but Thrain was standing near too," says Njal.

"They thought they had need of much strength," says Skarphedinn, and
sang a song--

"Bold in deeds of derring-do,  
Burdeners of ocean's steeds,  
Strength enough it seems they needed  
All to slay a single man;  
When shall we our hands uplift?  
We who brandish burnished steel--  
Famous men erst reddened weapons,  
When? if now we quiet sit?"

"Yes! when shall the day come when we shall lift our hands?"

"That will not be long off," says Njal, "and then thou shalt not be
baulked; but still, methinks, I set great store on your not breaking
this peace that I have made."

"Then we will not break it," says Skarphedinn, "but if anything arises
between us, then we will bear in mind the old feud."

"Then I will ask you to spare no one," says Njal.
