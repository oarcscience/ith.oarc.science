# 27. HELGI NJAL'S SON'S WOOING

A little after they rode out across Thurso water, and fared till they
came into Tongue. Asgrim was at home, and gave them a hearty welcome;
and they were there that night. Next morning they began to talk, and
then Njal raised the question of the wooing, and asked for Thorhalla for
his son Helgi's hand. Asgrim answered that well, and said there were no
men with whom he would be more willing to make this bargain than with
them. They fell a-talking then about terms, and the end of it was that
Asgrim betrothed his daughter to Helgi, and the bridal day was named.
Gunnar was at that feast, and many other of the bestmen. After the feast
Njal offered to foster in his house Thorhall, Asgrim's son, and he was
with Njal long after. He loved Njal more than his own father. Njal
taught him law, so that he became the greatest lawyer in Iceland in
those days.
