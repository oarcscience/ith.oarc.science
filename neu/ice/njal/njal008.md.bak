# 8. MORD CLAIMS HIS GOODS FROM HRUT

Hrut came home, and knit his brows when he heard his wife was gone, but
yet kept his feelings well in hand, and stayed at home all that
half-year, and spoke to no one on the matter. Next summer he rode to the
Thing, with his brother Hauskuld, and they had a great fellowing. But
when he came to the Thing, he asked whether Fiddle Mord were at the
Thing, and they told him he was; and all thought they would come to
words at once about their matter, but it was not so. At last, one day
when the brothers and others who were at the Thing went to the Hill of
Laws, Mord took witness and declared that he had a money-suit against
Hrut for his daughter's dower, and reckoned the amount at ninety
hundreds in goods, calling on Hrut at the same time to pay and hand it
over to him, and asking for a fine of three marks. He laid the suit in
the Quarter Court, into which it would come by law, and gave lawful
notice, so that all who stood on the Hill of Laws might hear.

But when he had thus spoken, Hrut said, "Thou hast undertaken this suit,
which belongs to thy daughter, rather for the greed of gain and love of
strife than in kindliness and manliness. But I shall have something to
say against it; for the goods which belong to me are not yet in thy
bands. Now, what I have to say is this, and I say it out, so that all
who hear me on this hill may bear witness: I challenge thee to fight on
the island; there on one side shall be laid all thy daughter's dower,
and on the other I will lay down goods worth as much, and whoever wins
the day shall have both dower and goods; but if thou wilt not fight with
me, then thou shalt give up all claim to these goods."

Then Mord held his peace, and took counsel with his friends about going
to fight on the island, and Jorund the priest gave him an answer.

"There is no need for thee to come to ask us for counsel in this matter,
for thou knowest if thou fightest with Hrut thou wilt lose both life and
goods. He has a good cause, and is besides mighty in himself and one of
the boldest of men."

Then Mord spoke out, that he would not fight with Hrut, and there arose
a great shout and hooting on the hill, and Mord got the greatest shame
by his suit.

After that men ride home from the Thing, and those brothers Hauskuld and
Hrut ride west to Reykriverdale, and turned in as guests at Lund, where
Thiostolf, Bjorn Gullbera's son, then dwelt. There had been much rain
that day, and men got wet, so long-fires were made down the length of
the hall. Thiostolf, the master of the house, sat between Hauskuld and
Hrut, and two boys, of whom Thiostolf had the rearing, were playing on
the floor, and a girl was playing with them. They were great
chatterboxes, for they were too young to know better. So one of them
said, "Now I will be Mord, and summon thee to lose thy wife because thou
hast not been a good husband to her."

Then the other answered, "I will be Hrut, and I call on thee to give up
all claim to thy goods, if thou darest not to fight with me."

This they said several times, and all the household burst out laughing.
Then Hauskuld got wroth, and struck the boy who called himself Mord with
a switch, and the blow fell on his face, and grazed the skin.

"Get out with thee," said Hauskuld to the boy, "and make no game of us;"
but Hrut said, "Come hitherto me," and the boy did so. Then Hrut drew a
ring from his finger and gave it to him, and said, "Go away, and try no
man's temper henceforth."

Then the boy went away saying, "Thy manliness I will bear in mind all my
life."

From this matter Hrut got great praise, and after that they went home;
and that was the end of Mord's and Hrut's quarrel,
