# 80. OF KOLSKEGG: HOW HE WAS BAPTIZED

Now it is to be told of Kolskegg how he comes to Norway, and is in the
Bay east that winter. But the summer after he fares east to Denmark, and
bound himself to Sweyn Forkbeard the Dane-king, and there he had great
honour.

One night he dreamt that a man came to him; he was bright and
glistening, and he thought he woke him up. He spoke, and said to him,
"Stand up and come with me."

"What wilt thou with me?" he asks.

"I will get thee a bride, and thou shalt be my knight."

He thought he said yea to that, and after that he woke up.

Then he went to a wizard and told him the dream, but he read it so that
he should fare to southern lands and become God's knight.

Kolskegg was baptized in Denmark, but still he could not rest there, but
fared east to Russia, and was there one winter. Then he fared thence out
to Micklegarth (1), and there took service with the Emperor. The last
that was heard of him was, that he wedded a wife there, and was captain
over the Varangians, and stayed there till his deathday; and he, too, is
out of this story.
