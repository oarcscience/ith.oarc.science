# 32. GUNNAR COMES OUT TO ICELAND

When the spring came, the Earl asks Gunnar what course he meant to take.
He said he would go to Iceland. The Earl said that had been a bad year
for grain, "and there will be little sailing out to Iceland, but still
thou shalt have meal and timber both in thy ship."

Gunnar fitted out his ship as early as he could, and Hallvard fared out
with him and Kolskegg. They came out early in the summer, and made
Arnbael's Oyce before the Thing met.

Gunnar rode home from the ship, but got men to strip her and lay her up.
But when they came home all men were glad to see them. They were blithe
and merry to their household, nor had their haughtiness grown while they
were away.

Gunnar asks if Njal were at home; and he was told that he was at home;
then he let them saddle his horse, and those brothers rode over to
Bergthorsknoll.

Njal was glad at their coming, and begged them to stay there that night,
and Gunnar told him of his voyages.

Njal said he was a man of the greatest mark, "and thou hast been much
proved; but still thou wilt be more tried hereafter; for many will envy
thee."

"With all men I would wish to stand well," says Gunnar.

"Much bad will happen," said Njal, "and thou wilt always have some
quarrel to ward off."

"So be it, then," says Gunnar, "so that I have a good ground on my
side."

"So will it be too," says NjaI, "if thou hast not to smart for others."

Njal asked Gunnar if he would ride to the Thing. Gunnar said he was
going to ride thither, and asks Njal whether he were going to ride; but
he said he would not ride thither, "and if I had my will thou wouldst do
the like."

Gunnar rode home, and gave Njal good gifts, and thanked him for the care
he had taken of his goods. Kolskegg urged him on much to ride to the
Thing, saying, "There thy honour will grow, for many will flock to see
thee there."

"That has been little to my mind," says Gunnar, "to make a show of
myself; but I think it good and right to meet good and worthy men."

Hallvard by this time was also come thither, and offered to ride to the
thing with them.
