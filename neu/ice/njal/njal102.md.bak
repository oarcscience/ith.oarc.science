# 102. THE WEDDING OF HAUSKULD, THE PRIEST OF WHITENESS

Now we must take up the story, and say that Njal spoke thus to Hauskuld,
his foster-son, and said, "I would seek thee a match."

Hauskuld bade him settle the matter as he pleased, and asked whether he
was most likely to turn his eyes.

"There is a woman called Hildigunna," answers Njal, "and she is the
daughter of Starkad, the son of Thord Freyspriest. She is the best match
I know of."

"See thou to it, foster-father," said Hauskuld; "that shall be my choice
which thou choosest."

"Then we will look thitherward," says Njal.

A little while after, Njal called on men to go along with him. Then the
sons of Sigfus, and Njal's sons, and Kari Solmund's son, all of them
fared with him and they rode east to Swinefell.

There they got a hearty welcome.

The day after, Njal and Flosi went to talk alone, and the speech of Njal
ended thus, that he said, "This is my errand here, that we have set out
on a wooing-journey, to ask for thy kinswoman Hildigunna."

"At whose hand?" says Flosi.

"At the hand of Hauskuld, my foster-son," says Njal.

"Such things are well meant," says Flosi, "but still ye run each of you
great risk, the one from the other; but what hast thou to say of
Hauskuld?"

"Good I am able to say of him," says Njal; "and besides, I will lay down
as much money as will seem fitting to thy niece and thyself, if thou
wilt think of making this match.

"We will call her hither," says Flosi, "and know how she looks on the
man."

Then Hildigunna was called, and she came thither.

Flosi told her of the wooing, but she said she was a proudhearted woman.

"And I know not how things will turn out between me and men of like
spirit; but this, too, is not the least of my dislike, that this man has
no priesthood or leadership over men, but thou hast always said that
thou wouldest not wed me to a man who had not the priesthood."

"This is quite enough," says Flosi, "if thou wilt not be wedded to
Hauskuld, to make me take no more pains about the match."

"Nay! " she says, "I do not say that I will not be wedded to Hauskuld if
they can get him a priesthood or a leadership over men; but otherwise I
will have nothing to say to the match."

"Then," said Njal, "I will beg thee to let this match stand over for
three winters, that I may see what I can do."

Flosi said that so it should be.

"I will only bargain for this one thing," says Hildigunna, "if this
match comes to pass, that we shall stay here away east."

Njal said he would rather leave that to Hauskuld, but Hauskuld said that
he put faith in many men, but in none so much as his foster-father.

Now they ride from the east.

Njal sought to get a priesthood and leadership for Hauskuld, but no one
was willing to sell his priesthood, and now the summer passes away till
the Althing.

There were great quarrels at the Thing that summer, and many a man then
did as was their wont, in faring to see Njal; but he gave such counsel
in men's lawsuits as was not thought at all likely, so that both the
pleadings and the defence came to naught, and out of that great strife
arose, when the lawsuits could not be brought to an end, and men rode
home from the Thing unatoned.

Now things go on till another Thing comes. Njal rode to the Thing, and
at first all is quiet until Njal says that it is high time for men to
give notice of their suits.

Then many said that they thought that came to little, when no man could
get his suit settled, even though the witnesses were summoned to the
Althing, "and so," say they, "we would rather seek our rights with point
and edge."

"So it must not be," says Njal, "for it will never do to have no law in
the land. But yet ye have much to say on your side in this matter, and
it behoves us who know the law, and who are bound to guide the law, to
set men at one again, and to ensue peace. 'Twere good counsel, then,
methinks, that we call together all the chiefs and talk the matter
over."

Then they go to the Court of Laws, and Njal spoke and said, "Thee,
Skapti Thorod's son and you other chiefs, I call on, and say, that
methinks our lawsuits have come into a dead lock, if we have to follow
up our suits in the Quarter Courts, and they get so entangled that they
can neither be pleaded nor ended. Methinks, it were wiser if we had a
Fifth Court, and there pleaded those suits which cannot be brought to an
end in the Quarter Courts."

"How," said Skapti, "wilt thou name a Fifth Court, when the Quarter
Court is named for the old priesthoods, three twelves in each quarter?"

"I can see help for that," says Njal, "by setting up new priesthoods,
and filling them with the men who are best fitted in each Quarter, and
then let those men who are willing to agree to it, declare themselves
ready to join the new priest's Thing."

"Well," says Skapti, "we will take this choice; but what weighty suits
shall come before the court?"

"These matters shall come before it," says Njal,--"all matters of
contempt of the Thing, such as if men bear false witness, or utter a
false finding; hither, too, shall come all those suits in which the
judges are divided in opinion in the Quarter Court; then they shall be
summoned to the Fifth Court; so, too, if men offer bribes, or take them,
for their help in suits. In this court all the oaths shall be of the
strongest kind, and two men shall follow every oath, who shall support
on their words of honour what the others swear. So it shall be also, if
the pleadings on one side are right in form, and the other wrong, that
the judgment shall be given for those that are right in form. Every suit
in this court shall be pleaded just as is now done in the Quarter Court,
save and except that when four twelves are named in the Fifth Court,
then the plaintiff shall name and set aside six men out of the court,
and the defendant other six; but if he will not set them aside, then the
plaintiff shall name them and set them aside as he has done with his own
six; but if the plaintiff does not set them aside, then the suit comes
to naught, for three twelves shall utter judgment on all suits. We shall
also have this arrangement in the Court of Laws, that those only shall
have the right to make or change laws who sit on the middle bench, and
to this bench those only shall be chosen who are wisest and best. There,
too, shall the Fifth Court sit; but if those who sit in the Court of
Laws are not agreed as to what they shall allow or bring in as law, then
they shall clear the court for a division, and the majority shall bind
the rest; but if any man who has a seat in the Court be outside the
Court of Laws and cannot get inside it, or thinks himself overborne in
the suit, then he shall forbid them by a protest, so that they can hear
it in the Court, and then he has made all their grants and all their
decisions void and of none effect, and stopped them by his protest."

After that, Skapti Thorod's son brought the Fifth Court into the law,
and all that was spoken of before. Then men went to the Hill of Laws,
and men set up new priesthoods: In the Northlanders' Quarter were these
new priesthoods. The priesthood of the Melmen in Midfirth, and the
Laufesingers' priesthood in the Eyjafirth.

Then Njal begged for a hearing, and spoke thus: "It is known to many men
what passed between my sons and the men of Gritwater when they slew
Thrain Sigfus' son. But for all that we settled the matter; and now I
have taken Hauskuld into my house, and planned a marriage for him if he
can get a priesthood anywhere; but no man will sell his priesthood, and
so I will beg you to give me leave to set up a new priesthood at
Whiteness for Hauskuld."

He got this leave from all, and after that he set up the new priesthood
for Hauskuld; and he was afterwards called Hauskuld, the Priest of
Whiteness.

After that, men ride home from the Thing, and Njal stayed but a short
time at home ere he rides east to Swinefell, and his sons with him, and
again stirs in the matter of the marriage with Flosi; but Flosi said he
was ready to keep faith with them in everything.

Then Hildigunna was betrothed to Hauskuld, and the day for the wedding
feast was fixed, and so the matter ended. They then ride home, but they
rode again shortly to the bridal, and Flosi paid down all her goods and
money after the wedding, and all went off well.

They fared home to Bergthorsknoll, and were there the next year, and all
went well between Hildigunna and Bergthom. But the next spring Njal
bought land in Ossaby, and hands it over to Hauskuld, and thither he
fares to his own abode. Njal got him all his household, and there was
such love between them all, that none of them thought anything that he
said or did any worth unless the others had a share in it.

Hauskuld dwelt long at Ossaby, and each backed the other's honour, and
Njal's sons were always in Hauskuld's company. Their friendship was so
warm, that each house bade the other to a feast every harvest, and gave
each other great gifts; and so it goes on for a long while.
