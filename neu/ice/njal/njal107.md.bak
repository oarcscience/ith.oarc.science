# 107. OF MORD AND NJAL'S SONS

Some while after Mord rode to Bergthorsknoll and saw Skarphedinn there;
he fell into very fair words with them, and so he talked the whole day,
and said he wished to be good friends with them, and to see much of
them.

Skarphedinn took it all well, but said he had never sought for anything
of the kind before. So it came about that he got himself into such great
friendship with them, that neither side thought they had taken any good
counsel unless the other had a share in it.

Njal always disliked his coming thither, and it often happened that he
was angry with him.

It happened one day that Mord came to Bergthorsknoll, and Mord said to
Njal's sons, "I have made up my mind to give a feast yonder, and I mean
to drink in my heirship after my father, but to that feast I wish to bid
you, Njal's sons, and Kari; and at the same time I give you my word that
ye shall not fare away giftless."

They promised to go, and now he fares home and makes ready the feast. He
bade to it many householders, and that feast was very crowded.

Thither came Njal's sons and Kari. Mord gave Skarphedinn a brooch of
gold, and a silver belt to Kari, and good gifts to Grim and Helgi.

They come home and boast of these gifts, and show them to Njal. He said
they would be bought full dear, "and take heed that ye do not repay the
giver in the coin which he no doubt wishes to get."
