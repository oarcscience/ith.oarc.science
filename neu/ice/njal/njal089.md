# 89. NJAL'S SONS AND KARI COME OUT TO ICELAND

That summer Kari and Njal's sons busked them for Iceland, and when they
were "all-boun" they went to see the earl. The earl gave them good
gifts, and they parted with great friendship.

Now they put to sea and have a short passage, and they got a fine fair
breeze, and made the land at Eyrar. Then they got them horses and ride
from the ship to Bergthorsknoll, but when they came home all men were
glad to see them. They flitted home their goods and laid up the ship,
and Kari was there that winter with Njal.

But the spring after, Kari asked for Njal's daughter, Helga, to wife,
and Helgi and Grim backed his suit; and so the end of it was that she
was betrothed to Kari and the day for the wedding- feast was fixed, and
the feast was held half a month before mid-summer, and they were that
winter with Njal.

Then Kari bought him land at Dyrholms, east away by Mydale, and set up a
farm there; they put in there a grieve and housekeeper to see after the
farm, but they themselves were ever with Njal.
