# 100. OF GIZUR THE WHITE AND HJALLTI

That same summer Hjallti Skeggi's son was outlawed at the Thing for
blasphemy against the Gods.

Thangbrand told King Olaf of all the mischief that the Icelanders had
done to him, and said that they were such sorcerers there that the earth
burst asunder under his horse and swallowed up the horse.

Then King Olaf was so wroth that he made them seize all the men from
Iceland and set them in dungeons, and meant to slay them.

Then they, Gizur the White and Hjallti, came up and offered to lay
themselves in pledge for those men, and fare out to Iceland and preach
the faith. The king took this well, and they got them all set free
again.

Then Gizur and Hjallti busked their ship for Iceland, and were soon
"boun." They made the land at Eyrar when ten weeks of summer had passed;
they got them horses at once, but left other men to strip their ship.
Then they ride with thirty men to the Thing, and sent word to the
Christian men that they must be ready to stand by them.

Hjallti stayed behind at Reydarmull, for he had heard that he had been
made an outlaw for blasphemy, but when they came to the "Boiling Kettle"
(1) down below the brink of the Rift (2), there came Hjallti after them,
and said he would not let the heathen men see that he was afraid of
them.

Then many Christian men rode to meet them, and they ride in battle array
to the Thing. The heathen men had drawn up their men in array to meet
them, and it was a near thing that the whole body of the Thing had come
to blows, but still it did not go so far.

ENDNOTES:

\(1\) "Boiling kettle." This was a hyer, or hot spring. (2) This was the
"Raven's Rift," opposite to the "Great Rift" on the other side of
Thingfield.
