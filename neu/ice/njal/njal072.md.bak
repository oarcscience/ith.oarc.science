# 72. OF THE SUITS FOR MANSLAUGHTER AT THE THING

These tidings were spread far and wide, and Thorgeir's death was a great
grief to many a man. Gizur the White and his men rode to the spot and
gave notice of the manslaughter, and called the neighbours on the
inquest to the Thing. Then they rode home west.

Njal and Gunnar met and talked about the battle. Then Njal said to
Gunnar, "Now be ware of thyself. Now hast thou slain twice in the same
stock; and so now take heed to thy behaviour, and think that it is as
much as thy life is worth, if thou dost not hold to the settlement that
is made."

"Nor do I mean to break it in any way," says Gunnar, "but still I shall
need thy help at the Thing."

"I will hold to my faithfulness to thee," said Njal, "till my death
day."

Then Gunnar rides home. Now the Thing draws near; and each side gather a
great company; and it is a matter of much talk at the Thing how these
suits will end.

Those two, Gizur the White, and Geir the Priest, talked with each other
as to who should give notice of the suit of manslaughter after Thorgeir,
and the end of it was that Gizur took the suit on his hand, and gave
notice of it at the Hill of Laws, and spoke in these words:--

"I gave notice of a suit for assault laid down by law against Gunnar
Hamond's son; for that he rushed with an onslaught laid down by law on
Thorgeir Otkell's son, and wounded him with a body wound, which proved a
death wound, so that Thorgeir got his death.

"I say on this charge he ought to become a convicted outlaw, not to be
fed, not to be forwarded, not to be helped or harboured in any need.

"I say that his goods are forfeited, half to me and half to the men of
the Quarter, whose right it is by law to seize the goods of outlaws.

"I give notice of this charge in the Quarter Court, into which this suit
ought by law to come.

"I give this lawful notice in the hearing of all men at the Hill of
Laws.

"I give notice now of this suit, and of full forfeiture and outlawry
against Gunnar Hamond's son."

A second time Gizur took witness, and gave notice of a suit against
Gunnar Hamond's son, for that he had wounded Thorgeir Otkell's son with
a body wound which was a death wound, and from which Thorgeir got his
death, on such and such a spot when Gunnar first sprang on Thorgeir with
an onslaught, laid down by law.

After that he gave notice of this declaration as he had done of the
first. Then he asked in what Quarter Court the suit lay, and in what
house in the district the defendant dwelt.

When that was over, men left the Hill of Laws, and all said that he
spoke well.

Gunnar kept himself well in hand and said little or nothing.

Now the Thing wears away till the day when the courts were to be set.

Then Gunnar stood looking south by the court of the men of Rangriver,
and his men with him.

Gizur stood looking north, and calls his witnesses, and bade Gunnar to
listen to his oath, and to his declaration of the suit, and to all the
steps and proofs which he meant to bring forward. After that he took his
oath, and then he brought forward the suit in the same shape before the
court, as he had given notice of it before. Then he made them bring
forward witness of the notice, then he bade the neighbours on the
inquest to take their seats, and called upon Gunnar to challenge the
inquest.
