<P>And when they came into the booth then they saw where Gudmund the Powerful sate and talked with Einar Conal's son, his foster- child; he was a wise man.</P>
<P>Then they come before him, and Gudmund welcomed them very heartily, and made them clear the booth for them, that they might all be able to sit down.</P>
<P>Then they asked what tidings, and Asgrim said, "There is no need to mutter what I have to say. We wish, Gudmund, to ask for thy steadfast help."</P>
<P>"Have ye seen any other chiefs before?" said Gudmund.</P>
<P>They said they had been to see Skapti Thorod's son and Snorri the Priest, and told him quietly how they had fared with each of them.</P>
<P>Then Gudmund said, "Last time I behaved badly and meanly to you. Then I was stubborn, but now ye shall drive your bargain with me all the more quickly because I was more stubborn then, and now I will go myself with you to the court with all my Thing-men, and stand by you in all such things as I can, and fight for you though this be needed, and lay down my life for your lives. I will also pay Skapti out in this way, that Thorstein Gape-mouth his son shall be in the battle on our side, for he will not dare to do aught else than I will, since he has Jodisa my daughter to wife, and then Skapti will try to part us."</P>
<P>They thanked him, and talked with him long and low afterwards, so that no other men could hear.</P>
<P>Then Gudmund bade them not to go before the knees of any other chiefs, for he said that would be little-hearted.</P>
<P>"We will now run the risk with the force that we have. Ye must go with your weapons to all law-business, but not fight as things stand."</P>
<P>Then they went all of them home to their booths, and all this was at first with few men's knowledge.</P>
<P>So now the Thing goes on.</P>
