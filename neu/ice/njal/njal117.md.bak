# 117. NJAL AND SKARPHEDINN TALK TOGETHER

Now, we must say how Njal said to Skarphedinn.

"What plan have ye laid down for yourselves, thou and thy brothers and
Kari?"

"Little reck we of dreams in most matters," said Skarphedinn; "but if
thou must know, we shall ride to Tongue to Asgrim Ellidagrim's son, and
thence to the Thing; but, what meanest thou to do about thine own
journey, father?"

"I shall ride to the Thing," says Njal, "for it belongs to my honour not
to be severed from your suit so long as I live. I ween that many men
will have good words to say of me, and so I shall stand you in good
stead, and do you no harm."

There, too, was Thorhall Asgrim's son, and Njal's fosterson. The sons of
Njal laughed at him because he was clad in a coat of russet, and asked
how long he meant to wear that?

"I shall have thrown it off," he said, "when I have to follow up the
blood-feud for my foster-father."

"There will ever be most good in thee," said Njal, "when there is most
need of it."

So they all busked them to ride away from home, and were nigh thirty men
in all, and rode till they came to Thursowater. Then came after them
Njal's kinsmen, Thorleif Crow, and Thorgrim the Big; they were
Holt-Thorir's sons, and offered their help and following to Njal's sons,
and they took that gladly.

So they rode altogether across Thursowater, until they came on Laxwater
bank, and took a rest and baited their horses there, and there Hjallti
Skeggi's son came to meet them, and Njal's sons fell to talking with
him, and they talked long and low.

"Now, I will show," said Hjallti, "that I am not blackhearted; Njal has
asked me for help, and I have agreed to it, and given my word to aid
him; he has often given me and many others the worth of it in cunning
counsel."

Hjallti tells Njal all about Flosi's doings. They sent Thorhall on to
Tongue to tell Asgrim that they would be there that evening; and Asgrim
made ready at once, and was out of doors to meet them when Njal rode
into the town."

Njal was clad in a blue cape, and had a felt hat on his head, and a
small axe in his hand. Asgrim helped Njal off his horse, and led him and
sate him down in his own seat. After that they all went in, Njal's sons
and Kari. Then Asgrim went out.

Hjallti wished to turn away, and thought there were too many there; but
Asgrim caught hold of his reins, and said he should never have his way
in riding off, and made men unsaddle their horses, and led Hjallti in
and sate him down by Njal's side; but Thorleif and his brother sat on
the other bench and their men with them.

Asgrim sate him down on a stool before Njal, and asked, "What says thy
heart about our matter?"

"It speaks rather heavily," says Njal, "for I am afraid that we shall
have no lucky men with us in the suit; but I would, friend, that thou
shouldest send after all the men who belong to thy Thing, and ride to
the Althing with me."

"I have always meant to do that," says Asgrim; "and this I will promise
thee at the same time, that I will never leave thy cause while I can get
any men to follow me."

But all those who were in the house thanked him, and said that was
bravely spoken. They were there that night, but the day after all
Asgrim's band came thither.

And after that they all rode together till they come up on the
Thing-field, and fit up their booths.
