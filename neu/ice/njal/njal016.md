# 16. GLUM'S SHEEP HUNT

Now once on a time when autumn came, it happened that men had hard work
to get their flocks home, and many of Glum's wethers were missing. Then
Glum said to Thiostolf, "Go thou up on the fell with my house-carles and
see if ye cannot find out anything about the sheep."

"'Tis no business of mine," says Thiostolf, "to hunt up sheep, and this
one thing is quite enough to hinder it. I won't walk in thy thralls'
footsteps. But go thyself, and then I'll go with thee."

About this they had many words. The weather was good, and Hallgerda was
sitting out of doors. Glum went up to her and said, "Now Thiostolf and I
have had a quarrel, and we shall not live much longer together." And so
he told her all that they had been talking about.

Then Hallgerda spoke up for Thiostolf, and they had many words about
him. At last Glum gave her a blow with his hand, and said, "I will
strive no longer with thee," and with that he went away.

Now she loved him much, and could not calm herself, but wept out loud.
Thiostolf went up to her and said, "This is sorry sport for thee, and so
it must not be often again."

"Nay," she said, "but thou shalt not avenge this, nor meddle at all
whatever passes between Glum and me."

He went off with a spiteful grin.
