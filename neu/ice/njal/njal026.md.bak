# 26. OF ASGRIM AND HIS CHILDREN

There was a man named Asgrim (1). He was Ellidagrim's son. The brother
of Asgrim Ellidagrim's son was Sigfus (2). Gauk Trandil's son was
Asgrim's foster-brother, who is said to have been the fairest man of his
day, and best skilled in all things; but matters went ill with them, for
Asgrim slew Gauk.

Asgrim had two sons, and each of them was named Thorhall. They were both
hopeful men. Grim was the name of another of Asgrim's sons, and
Thorhalla was his daughter's name. She was the fairest of women, and
well behaved.

Njal came to talk with his son Helgi, and said, "I have thought of a
match for thee, if thou wilt follow my advice."

"That I will surely," says he, "for I know that thou both meanest me
well, and canst do well for me; but whither hast thou turned thine
eyes."

"We will go and woo Asgrim Ellidagrim's son's daughter, for that is the
best choice we can make."

ENDNOTES:

\(1\) Ellidagrim was Asgrim's son, Aundot the Crow's son. His mother's
