<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">18. FIDDLE MORD'S DEATH</H1>
<P>Now it must be told how Fiddle Mord took a sickness and breathed his last; and that was thought great scathe. His daughter Unna took all the goods he left behind him. She was then still unmarried the second time. She was very layish, and unthrifty of her property; so that her goods and ready money wasted away, and at last she had scarce anything left but land and stock.</P>
