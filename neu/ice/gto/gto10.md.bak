### CHAPTER V.

### THE SOURSOPS ABROAD.

THAT summer, there came a ship from the sea into Dyrafirth, owned by two
brothers, Norsemen. One's name was Thorir, and the other's Thorarinn.
They were men from "the Bay," in South Norway. The story runs that
Thorgrim the Priest rides to the ship, and buys of the captains wood
worth four hundreds in woollen, and pays some of the price down, and
promises to pay the rest. So the Easterlings made their ship snug at
Sandwater-mouth and got winter-quarters for themselves and their men at
the house of a man called Oddi who lived in Skutilsfirth. Now Thorgrim
sends his son Thorodd to fetch home the wood, and bade him reckon it and
know well every plank as he took it. So, he comes up to the ship, and
thought the terms of the bargain were not so clear as Thorgrim had told
him; for now the Easterlings were unwilling to keep to what they had
agreed at first, and the end was that Thorodd spake ill words to the
Easterlings. That they would not stand, and fell on him, and slew him
there and then. After that the Easterlings left the ship, and took
horse, and went to ride to their quarters in Skutilsfirth. They rode all
that day and the night after, till they came to the dale which turns off
from Skutilsfirth. Here they break their fast, and afterwards

rode on again. Meanwhile Thorgrim had heard what had happened; how his
son was slain, and the wood not handed over. Then he busked him for a
journey, and had himself put across the firth. After the Easterlings he
goes, all alone, and comes upon them as they lay and slept on a bit of
mead. Thorgrim. wakes Thorarinn, and prods him with the butt of his
spear. He springs up, and was about to draw his sword, for he knows
Thorgrim, but Thorgrim thrusts his spear through him. Now Thorir wakes
and would avenge his brother, but Thorgrim slew him too with his spear.
So that is called Breakfastdale, where they broke their fast, and the,
Easterlingsfall, where they lost their lives. Now Thorgrim goes home,
and is famous for this deed. All that winter he stayed at home; but next
spring the two brothers-in-law, Thorgrim and Thorkel, fitted out the
ship which the Easterlings had owned for a foreign cruise, and they lade
her with their goods, and were to sail for Norway. As for those
Easterlings, they had been ill-doers in Norway, and were under a ban
there. So they set sail the same summer, and Gisli also went aboard with
his brother-in-law Vestein, and they sailed from Skeljawick in
Steingrimsfirth. Aunund of Tweendale had care of Thorkel's and Gisli's
farm while they were away, and Quarrelsome Stein took charge of
Thorgrim's farm at Sæbol, along with his wife Thordisa.

At that time Harold Grayfell ruled over Norway. Thorgrim and Thorkel
went north to Drontheim, and met the king there. They went in before
him, and hailed him, and he was gracious to them. They became his
thanes. They were well off both

for goods and honour. As for Gisli and Vestein they were more than a
hundred days out, and about the first day of winter came upon the coast
of Hordaland in Norway, in a great fog and storm, at dead of night.
Their ship was dashed to pieces, but they saved their goods and crew.
There was a man off the coast called Beard-Bjalf. He owned a ship, and
was on his way to Denmark. So Gisli and Vestein dealt with him for half
the ship. He heard they were brave fellows, and gave them half the ship,
and they repaid him at once by giving him more than half her worth in
goods. So they held on their course for Denmark to that mart called
Viborg. They stayed there that winter with a man called Sigrhadd. There
they were all three in good fellowship--Gisli, Vestein, and Bjalf. They
were great friends, and many gifts passed between them. At that time
Christianity had come into Denmark, and Gisli and his companions were
marked with the cross, for it was much the wont in those days of all who
went on trading voyages; for so they entered into full fellowship with
Christian men. Early the spring after, Bjalf fitted out his ship for
Iceland. Now there was a man named Sigurd, a Norseman: he was a trading
partner of Vestein's, and was then away west in England. He sent word to
Vestein, and said he wished to cease partnership with him, for he
thought he needed his goods no longer. So Vestein asked leave of Gisli
to go to meet him; "for," he said, "I have money and goods to seek in
that country."

"Thou shalt pledge me thy word first," said Gisli, "never to leave
Iceland again, if thou comest safe back, unless I give thee leave."

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

To that Vestein agreed.

Next morning Gisli rises up early and goes to the smithy. He was the
handiest of men, and had the quickest wit. So Gisli smithies a silver
coin which weighed an ounce. He bent back the coin and broke it in two,
and forged it with twenty teeth. When it was in two pieces there were
ten teeth on one bit and ten on the other, but when they were put
together it looked as though it were one whole; yet it might be taken
asunder at once. Now Gisli takes the coin in two, and gives one half
into Vestein's hand, and the other he keeps himself, He bids him keep
that as a token if anything befell them which they thought of weight.
"And," says Gisli, we will only send these tokens between us if our life
is at stake; and in truth my heart tells me we shall need to send them,
though we do not see each other face to face."

With that they parted, and Vestein sails to England, but Gisli and Bjalf
to Norway. That summer they set sail for Iceland, and had thriven well
in goods and honour, and they ceased their partnership, and Bjalf bought
back the half of the ship that Gisli owned. So Gisli goes home to his
house in Dyrafirth with twelve men. That same spring Thorgrim and
Thorkel fitted out their ship and came to Dyrafirth in the summer; and
the very same day that Gisli had sailed into the mouth of the Hawkdale
river Thorgrim and Thorkel sailed into it after him. So those brothers,
Gisli and Thorkel, met; and that was a very joyful meeting.

So each of them went to his own home.
