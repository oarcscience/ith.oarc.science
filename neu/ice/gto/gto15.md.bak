### CHAPTER X.

### GISLI BETRAYS HIMSELF.

Now Thorgrim's ale of heirship is brewed and drunk, and Bork gives good
gifts to many of his friends. The next thing we have to say is, that
Bork bargains with Thorgrim Bottlenose that he should work spells and
charms, by which no man should be able to house or harbour him that had
slain Thorgrim, however great their will might be, and that the slayer
should have no rest on land. An ox nine winters old was given him for
this; and now Thorgrim sets about his spells over his cauldron, and
makes him a high-place, and fulfils his work with all witchcraft and
wickedness. After that, the guests broke up, and each man went to his
own abode.

And now, too, a thing happened which seemed strange and new. No snow
lodged on the south side of Thorgrim's howe, nor did it freeze there.
And men guessed it was because Thorgrim had been so dear to Frey for his
worship's sake that the god would not suffer the frost to come between
them.

Now Bork sets up his abode with Thordisa, and takes his brother's widow
to wife, with his brother's goods; that was the rule in those
days--wives were heritage like other things. But Thordisa was not single
when this happened, and after a while

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

she bears a son to Thorgrim, and he is sprinkled with water, and at
first called Thorgrim, after his father; but as he grew up he was
thought snappish and unyielding in temper, and so his name was changed
to suit his mood, and he was called Snerrir the Snarler, and afterwards
Snorro.

So Bork abode there that half-year, and the sports they had spoken of
were set afoot. There was a woman named Audbjorga who dwelt at the top
of the Dale at Anmarkstead. She was sister to Thorgrim Bottlenose. Her
husband had been that Thorkel of whom we have spoken. Her son's name was
Thorstein, and he was about the strongest man in all the west country,
save Gisli. They are partners in the game at ball, Gisli and Thorstein
and against them were matched Bork and Thorkel. One day a host of men
came to see the game, for many were eager to behold the sport, and all
wanted to know who was the strongest man and the best player. But here,
as elsewhere, it happened that the players played with greater spirit
when there were many lookers-on. It is said that Bork could not stand
against Thorstein that day, and at last Bork got wroth, and broke
asunder Thorstein's bat; but Thorstein gave him a fall, and sent him
spinning along the slippery ice. But when Gisli sees that he says:

"Thorstein shall go on playing with Bork with all his might. I will
change bats with thee."

So they changed bats, and Gisli sate him down and tries to put the
broken bat to rights, and then he looks at Thorgrim's howe. There was
snow on the ground, but on the south side

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

of the howe there was no snow; and there, up on the steep brink sat
Thordisa and many other women, who thought it fun to look on the game.

Then Gisli--woe worth the day!--chaunted this song:

"O'er him who Thor's grim vizard wore  
Melt, wreath by wreath, snow-hangings hoar.  
Few have the wit to understand  
The riddle of this mound of land.  
I harmed him? No! I harmed him not;  
A mansion bright is here his lot;  
The priest unto his god I gave,  
And Frey now warms his servant's grave."

Thordisa heard these verses, and learned them by heart. She goes home,
and understood their meaning at once.

Now they leave off playing, and Thorstein sets out to go home. There was
a man named Thorgeir, called Thorgeir the Gorcock. He lived at
Gorcockstead. There was another man named Berg; his nickname was
Shortshanks. He lived at Shortshanks-mire, west of the river. Now as men
fare home they talk about the games; and Thorstein and Berg from talking
fell to quarrelling. Berg takes Bork's side, but Thorstein stands up for
himself. At last Berg smote Thorstein with the back of his axe; but
Thorgeir threw himself between them, so that Thorstein could not avenge
himself. So he goes home to his mother Audbjorga, who binds up his
wound, for the skin was broken, and she is ill-pleased at his plight.

All that night the carline could not sleep, so much did she take it to
heart. The weather was cold, but still and bright.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

\[paragraph continues\] But she goes once or twice round the house
widdershins, <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) and snuffs to all
airts, and draws in the air. And as she did this the weather began to
change, and there was a driving sleet, and after that a thaw; and a
flood poured down the hillside; and a snowslip fell on the farm of Berg,
and there twelve souls lost their lives, and the tokens of the landslip
are still to be seen.

Now Thorstein goes to Gisli, and he sheltered him, and sent him south to
Borgarfirth, and so abroad. But as soon as Bork heard of this black
deed, he went straight to Anmarkstead, and made them seize Audbjorga,
and takes her out to Saltness, and stones her with stones till she dies.
And when this is noised abroad, Gisli goes from home to Nebstead, and
seizes Thorgrim Bottlenose, and brings him to Saltness, and there a
goatskin is drawn over his head, that his evil eye may be harmless, and
he too is stoned to death, and buried by his sister's side, on the ridge
between Hawkdale and Tweendale. And now all is quiet, and the spring
draws on.

Now Bork makes up his mind to set off south to Thorsness, and thinks to
change his abode thither, and thinks he has made rather a sorry figure
there away west: lost such a man as Thorgrim was, and got no amends for
it. Still he makes ready to go, and means first to set his house to
rights, and then to make another journey to fetch his wife and goods.
Thorkel too, the Soursop, makes up his mind to go with his
brother-in-law Bork.

So men say that Thordisa, Gisli's sister, went with Bork a bit of the
way, and as they went Bork said:

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

"I wish now thou wouldest tell me why thou wast all at once so sad last
autumn when we broke up the games. Thou knowest thou saidst thou wouldst
tell me ere I went away."

They had just then come to Thorgrim's howe as he uttered these words.

Then she stamps her foot on the ground, and says it was no use to fare
farther. And now she tells him of the verses that Gisli had chaunted as
he mended the bat and looked at Thorgrim's howe; and recites the verses.

"I ween," she said, "thou hast no need to look anywhere else for
Thorgrim's manslayer, and thou mayst sue him for it with a safe heart,
for he took the slaying on himself in those verses."

Then Bork grew awfully angry, and said:

"I will now turn back at once and slay Gisli. The best way is to waste
no more time."

But Thorkel says he will not agree to that. "I am not quite sure whether
this be true or not. Bear in mind the saw that says 'Women's counsel is
always unlucky.' For even though this should be as bad as she has said,
surely, Bork, it is better to follow the law of the land in this matter
and make the man an outlaw; for thou hast the cause so made to thy hand
that Gisli must be found guilty, even though he had some excuse. So that
we shall be able to manage this suit as we choose if we take the right
steps, and that is far better than spoiling everything by rushing on so
madly against all reason."

The end was, that he had his way.
