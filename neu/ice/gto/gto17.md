### CHAPTER XII.

### GISLI BEGINS TO DREAM.

THE next three years Gisli was sometimes in his house at
Geirthiofsfirth, and sometimes with Thorkel the Wealthy, harboured by
stealth. Other three years he spent in roaming over the land, and going
from house to house asking help and countenance from great chiefs; but
something always tripped him up everywhere, so that naught came of it.
So mighty was that spell that Thorgrim's witchcraft had thrown on him
that it was fated no chief should shelter him, and no one ever went
heartily into his cause. After those six years were over he spent his
time for the most part in Geirthiofsfirth, sometimes in his house, over
which Auda ruled, and sometimes in the hiding-place which he had
hollowed out for himself. That was on the north bank of the river. But
he had another lair on the south bank among the crags, and there he
lurked for the most part.

Now when Bork hears this, he set off from home, and seeks Eyjolf the
Gray, who then dwelt in Arnarfirth in Otterdale, and begs him to hunt
for Gisli, and slay him as an outlaw, and if he slew him, he said he
would give him three hundreds in silver of

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

the very best, and bade him leave no stone unturned to find him out. He
takes the money, and gives his word to do his best. There was a man with
Eyjolf named Helgi--Spy-Helgi by nickname; he was both swift of foot and
sharp of eye, and he knew every inch of the firths. This man is sent to
Geirthiofsfirth to find out if Gisli be there. He soon is aware of a man
in hiding, but he knows not whether it be Gisli or another. So he goes
back and tells Eyjolf how things stand. Eyjolf says at once it must be
Gisli, and loses no time, but sets off with six men for Geirthiofsfirth;
but he cannot find Gisli, and goes bootless back.

Gisli was a foresighted man and a great dreamer, and dreamt true. All
wise men are of one mind that Gisli lived an outlaw longest of all men,
save Grettir, the son of Osmund. Eighteen years was Grettir an outlaw.
It is told that one autumn night Gisli was very restless as he slept,
while he was in Auda's house, and when he wakes she asks him what he had
dreamt?

"I have two women who are with me in my dreams," he answers; "one is
good to me, but the other tells me naught but evil, and her tale is
every day worse and worse, and she spaes me downright ruin. But what I
just dreamed was this: Methought I came to a house or hall, and into
that hall I went, and there I saw many of my friends and kinsfolk: they
sat by fires and drank. There were. seven fires; some had burnt very
low, but some still burned as bright as bright could be. Then in came my
better dream-wife, and said these were tokens of my life, how much of it
was still to come; and she counselled me so long

as I lived to leave all old unbeliefs and witchcraft, and to be good to
the deaf and the halt, and the poor and the weak. "Bear in mind," she
said, "thou hast so many years yet to live as thou sawest fires alight."
My dream was no longer than that. Then Gisli chaunted several staves:

"Fires seven, the bard remembers,  
  Lady, blazed within that hall;  
Men around those glowing embers  
  Sate and drank like brothers all.  
One and all those inmates gladly  
  Greeted Gisli as their guest;  
Gisli hailed them soft and sadly,  
  Fitting words his thanks expressed.

"Thus that weird wife, wise and witty,  
  Spoke, and said to Norway's friend--  
Soft her voice and full of pity,--  
  'Man! behold thy journey's end;  
Mark those seven fires burning,  
  Seven years to thee remain;  
Then, to this abode returning,  
  Make thee merry, free from pain.'

"'Noble man!' the voice continues,  
  'Shun the wizard's hateful lore;  
Hero bold, of strongest sinews,  
  Seek the muse's golden store.  
Bear in mind this precept hoary--  
  Naught so much defileth hearts  
As wicked wit, as idle story;  
  Vile is witchcraft, black her arts.

"'Stay thy hand, be slow to slaughter;  
  Rouse not men to seek thy life:  
Come! thy word to wisdom's daughter  
  Be not first in stirring strife. <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>  
Man of noble nature, ever  
  Help the weak, the halt, the blind;  
Hard the hand that opens never,  
  Bright and blest the generous mind.'"

Now Bork presses Eyjolf hard, and thinks he has not done so much as he
said he would, and that there had been small return for the silver he
had given him. He said he was quite sure Gisli was in Geirthiofsfirth,
and if Eyjolf did not send some one to take Gisli's life, Bork said he
must come and hunt him down himself: "For 'tis a shame that two such
champions and chiefs as we think ourselves cannot get Gisli put out of
the way."

Eyjolf was all alive again, and sends Spy-Helgi again round
Geirthiofsfirth; and now he takes food with him, and is away a week, and
lies in wait to catch sight of Gisli. At last one day he sees a man come
out of a hiding-place, and knows Gisli at once. As soon as he sees him
he goes back and tells Eyjolf what he had seen.

Now Eyjolf sets off with eight men, and makes for Auda's house in
Geirthiofsfirth; but they do not find Gisli there, and now they beat all
the thickets thereabouts, and still cannot find Gisli. Then they go back
to Auda's house, and Eyjolf offers her a great sum of money if she will
betray Gisli; but she would do nothing of the kind. Then they threatened
to maim her, but it was all no good, and they had to go back as wise as
they came. This was thought a most shameful journey for them; and Eyjolf
stays at home all that autumn.

But though Gisli had not been hunted down, he sees plain

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

enough that he must be taken, and that very soon, if he stays there. So
he breaks up from home, and goes along the coast to Strand, and rides to
see his brother Thorkel at "the Combe." He knocks at the door of the
sleeping-house in which Thorkel is abed, and he gets up, goes out, and
greets Gisli.

"I want to know, now," said Gisli, "if thou wilt yield me any help? I
look to thee for comfort and countenance, for now I am hard pressed, and
I have forborne to do this for a long time."

But Thorkel gave him the old answer, and said outright he would give him
no help that might get himself into trouble. Silver and horses he would
give him, if he needed them, or anything else, as he said before, but
nothing besides.

"Now I see," said Gisli, "that thou wilt not help me. Give me now three
hundred in wadmel, and make up your mind that henceforth I shall not
often ask thy aid."

Thorkel does as he wishes, and gives him the woollen and some silver.
Gisli said he would take what was given him, but added he would not
behave so meanly were he in Thorkel's place. At their parting Gisli was
very down-hearted.

Now he goes out to Vadil, to the mother of Gest, the son of Oddleif, and
reaches her house before dawn, and knocks at the door. The housewife
goes to the door. She was often wont to harbour outlaws, and she had an
underground room. One end of it opened on the river-bank and the other
below her hall. One way see the ruins of it still. Thorgerda--for that
was heir name--made Gisli welcome. "I am willing enough thou

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

shouldest stay here awhile, but I am sure I can't tell whether this is
not mere old wife's talk."

Old wife's talk or not, Gisli was willing to take it as it was meant,
and said he had not been so well treated by men that better things were
not to be hoped for from women.

So Gisli stays there that winter, and he was never better cared for in
all his outlawry than there.

As soon as ever the spring came Gisli fares back to Geirthiofsfirth, for
he could not bear to be any longer away from Auda his wife, so much they
loved each other. He is there that summer by stealth, and up to autumn.
And now as the nights lengthen the dreams lengthen with them, and that
worse dream-wife comes oftener and oftener to him, and he has hard
nights. Once he says to Auda, when she asks him what he had dreamt, and
his answer was in verse:

"A weary wife now haunts my slumber;  
  If dreams be true, as oft they be,  
Not many winters shall I number,  
  No tongue shall 'Graybeard!' shout to me:  
This dream-wife bids me peak and pine,  
  Vain 'tis to try to break her spell  
But little care I, darling mine!  
  I dream, but slumber soft and well."

And now he tells her that that worse dream-wife was ever coming to him,
and wishing to sprinkle blood over him, and to smear and bathe him in
it; and that she looked spitefully on him. Then he chaunted:

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

"Still my dreams are heavy-hearted,  
  Still my evil genius lowers;  
All my mirth hath clean departed,  
  Mine no more are blithesome hours:  
Sleep no sooner seals my eyelids  
  Than a loathly wife appears,  
Bathed in blood and gore-bedabbled,  
  Drenching me with dew of spears." <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11)

And again he chaunted:

"Darling wife, I now have uttered  
  All my mind about my dreams  
Nothing hidden, nothing muttered,  
  Words of truth welled out in streams:  
Wrath now riseth hour by hour,  
  Worse my foes shall feel my hand--  
High-born chiefs, whose haughty power,  
  Marked me with an outlaw's brand."
