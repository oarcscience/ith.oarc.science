### CHAPTER XI.

### GISLI AN OUTLAW.

So Bork and his men rode on after that by the path over the sands till
they get across the mouth of Sandwater; there they get off their horses
and bait. Then Thorkel says he wishes to see his brother-in-law Aunund,
and that he will ride on hard before them. But as soon as ever he was
out of sight be rides straight for Hol, and says what had happened, and
how Thordisa had given out that Gisli slew Thorgrim.

"Now," he says, "the story is in every man's mouth."

Gisli was silent a while, and then chaunted:

"My sister loves to tire her head,  
But little thinks of Gudrun dead--  
Gudrun, that high-souled Gjuki's child,  
Who saw her husband slain, and smiled;  
Another husband she might have,  
But barren lies a brother's grave ;  
And so, to 'venge her brother's fall,  
She slew her husband, sons, and all.

\[paragraph continues\] "And yet I never thought she would do this, for
I think I have often shown that her dishonour was not a whit less felt
by me than my own. Sometimes, too, I have had my life in peril for her
sake, but now she deals me this death-blow. But what am I to look for at
thy hands, kinsman, now that I have done such a deed?"

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

"This," said Thorkel, "I will warn thee if I am myself aware that men
are about to lie in wait for thy life, but I will give thee no other
help for which I may get into trouble. Methinks, too, thou hast much
misdone against me--slain both my brother-in-law, and partner, and bosom
friend."

"Well," says Gisli, "was it not to be looked for, for such a man as
Vestein was, that some revenge must be had for his loss? I would not
answer thee as thou answerest me; nor would I do as thou doest."

So those brothers parted, and now Thorkel rides back to meet Bork, and
they ride west across the heath. Bork does not draw bridle till he comes
south to Thorsness, and sets his house in order there. As for Thorkel
Soursop he buys him land at Bardastrand at a place called "the Combe."

But when the summoning days are coming on Bork sets out with sixty men
for the west firths, and means to summon Gisli to take his trial at
Thorsness Thing, and Thorkel went with him, and Thorodd and Quarrelsome
Stein, Bork's nephews, the sons of Thordisa, the daughter of Thorstein
Codbiter. There was an Easterling too, named Thorgrim, who went with
them.

So they all fared till they came to Sandwatermouth. Then Thorkel says
that he has some debts to call for at a farm called Hol, farther on in
their way.

"I will ride on first," he says; and so he does. But as soon as ever he
reached the farm he bade the housewife change horses with him.

"But let this horse of mine stand outside before the door,

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

saddled and bridled, and when they come by--my fellow-travellers--say I
am indoors telling silver."'

She did as he bade her--got him another horse; and he rides might and
main to Hol, sees Gisli, and tells what was about to befall him. Gisli
asks Thorkel again what counsel was best to take, and what countenance
he will give him. But Thorkel answers as before that he will do naught
else but warn him if any danger is about to befall him.

Now Thorkel rides away, and so shapes his course that he rode round
behind Bork and his fellows, mounts his own horse, and overtakes them.
He delays them as much as he can, and makes them lose much time. But as
soon as those brothers parted--Thorkel and Gisli--Gisli takes two
sledges, and drives off with them into the wood, with all his goods and
chattels: he had already sold his land to Thorkel, Erie's son: and he
takes Thord the Hareheart, his thrall, with him. Then Gisli said to
Thord:

"Oft hast thou been faithful and obedient to me, and done my bidding,
and I am bound to repay thee well." It was ever Gisli's wont to wear a
blue cape, and he was often well clad; and now Gisli goes on to say:

"I will give thee this cape, friend; put it on at once, and get up on
the last sledge. But I will lead the horses and wear thy cloak." So they
did that, and Thord thanks him over and over again for the gift.

Again Gisli said:

"Bear in mind, though men may follow on our heels, never

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

to answer a word if they call out to thee! But if the worst comes to the
worst, and they try to do thee harm, jump down and run away into the
wood, and let it shield us."

So they changed clothes. Thord was something like Gisli in bearing and
gait, and a tall, proper man, but as to his courage and wit there was
not a pin to choose between them; he had not a spark of either.

Now, Bork and his friends see Gisli going off into the wood, and run
after them as hard as they can. But when Thord sees that, he jumps off
the sledge in a trice, and runs nimbly among the trees. They all thought
they knew Gisli, and press on after him, and call out to him, but he
utters never a word. Then Thorgrim the Easterling hurls his spear after
him, and hit the thrall between the shoulders, and he fell flat on his
face, and needed no more.

Then Bork bawled out "Good luck. to thee for thy shot, thou happy man!"

As for the brothers Thorodd and Quarrelsome Stein, they spoke together
and said: "We will e'en hold on after the thrall, and see if he shows
any sport."

So they turned after him.

But when Bork and his friends came to the man in the blue cape they
stripped him of it, and saw who it was. And now they think the deed not
so lucky as they weened at first, for they saw it was only Thord the
Hareheart.

As for those brothers, it is said they saw Gisli near enough to know him
among the trees. Then one of them hurled a spear at

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

him, but he catches it in the air, and hurls it back, and it comes
towards Thorodd's waist, and flies right through him. Then Stein turns
back to meet his companions, and tells them what had happened.

After that they all went into the wood to beat it for Gisli. And lo! the
Easterling sees that the twigs stirred in one place, and he casts a
spear at a venture thither, and hits Gisli in the calf. But he sends the
spear back again to its owner, and aims so that it struck the Easterling
in the breast, and slew him there and then.

Now Bork and his men beat about the wood and cannot find him.; and then
they turn back to Gisli's house and set the suit on foot against him,
for now the proofs were as plain as day, and they had more than
guesswork to go on. They did not plunder anything there. So Bork fares
back home, little pleased with his journey.

Now Gisli goes up to the fell which stands by his farm, and there he
binds his wounds. He stays there so long as Bork and his men are in his
homestead, and thence be sees all that passes. As soon as they are gone
he goes home and makes ready to leave Hol with all his household. He
takes a boat and so flits his goods and cattle. Auda his wife went with
him and Gudrida, his foster-child. He sails out of Dyrafirth as far as
Husaness, and there lands. Gisli goes up to the farm, and meets a man,
who asks him what man he was. Gisli told him what he pleased, but not
the real truth. With that Gisli takes up a stone and throws it out on to
the Holm, which lies off the land there, and bade the churl's son do the
like when he got home, and said perhaps

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

he would then know what man had been there. But there was never a man
who could throw a stone so far; and here again it came out that Gisli
was better than most others in feats of strength. After that he went on
board his boat and rows round the ness, and across Arnarfirth, and
across that firth that turns aside from Arnarfirth, and is called
Geirthiofsfirth. There he set up his abode, and built a whole homestead,
and dwelt there that winter.

The next thing that happens is that Gisli sends word to his
brothers-in-law, Helgi, and Sigurd, and Vestgeir, to go to the Thing and
offer an atonement for him, that he might not be outlawed. So they set
off for the Thing the sons of Bjartmar, and could bring nothing to pass
about the atonement; and men go so far as to say that they behaved very
ill, so that they almost burst out into tears ere the suit was over.
They were then very young, and Bork the Stout was so wroth they could do
nothing with him.

When the Thing was over they went west and saw Thorkel the Wealthy of
Alvidra, and tell him all that had happened, and begged him to see Gisli
and tell him, for they said they did not dare to say to his face that he
was an outlaw.

So Gisli was outlawed. That was the great news at that Thing. And
Thorkel the Wealthy went and told Gisli. Then Gisli chaunted this stave:

"At Thorsness Thing  
  My suit at law  
Had never failed  
  For quirk or flaw, <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>  
Had Vestein's heart,  
  That never blenched,  
In Bjartmar's babies  
  Burned unquenched.

"They quailed, those kinsmen of my wife,  
When all their souls should warm with strife.  
To think that here was work to do,  
And foes to foil and conquer too.  
And so they fled the throng of men,  
As when, with addle egg of hen,  
The base-born thrall is pelted down  
By all the riff-raff of the town.

"Evil tidings from the North,  
An outlaw now I wander forth  
A forfeit life by land and sea  
None dares to speak a word for me  
But still, O man in battle tried,  
O bounteous man, whate'er betide,  
Know this, that vengeance shall be mine  
On those two caitiffs, Bork and Stein."

\[paragraph continues\] Both those namesakes, the Thorkels, say they
will give him all the shelter they can, so that they run no risk of
losing life or land. After that they went home.
