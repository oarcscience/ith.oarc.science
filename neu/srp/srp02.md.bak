# PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

A work has recently been published, to which, had I seen it before my
book went to press, I should have made frequent reference--Professor
Bernhard Schmidt's *Das Volksleben der Neugriechen und das hellenische
Alterthum*. The similarity between the folk-lore of the modern Greeks,
as described in it, <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) and that of the
Russians, is most striking--so much so, that it seems to point to
something more than a common origin ages ago. Professor Schmidt utterly
repudiates Fallmerayer's doctrine with respect to the preponderance of
the Slavonic element in the population of modern Greece, and he will not
allow that Slavonic myths have at all seriously affected those of
Hellenic descent. However this may be, many of the customs and songs
which I have quoted

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

in the present book offer a singular resemblance to those of the modern
Greeks, one which is often for closer than that which can be traced
between them and the rest of their kin in other lands. It may be worth
while in this Preface to mention a few of the details in which Slavonic
and Hellenic folk-life and folk-lore seem most alike.

The Russian Khorovod--the circling dance to song often of a serious or
even sad nature, which Kavelin traces back to heathen rites performed in
circle around an idol--appears to be closely akin to the dances which in
Greece still retain much of their old religious character. The Russian
*Kaliki*, or blind psalm-singers, and the reciters of the builinas, find
their exact counterpart in Greece. Such ideas as are held by the
Slavonians about the demoniacal character of mid-day, and which are
common to many countries, exercise special influence on the Greeks. The
Slavonic nymphs--Rusalkas, Vilas, Mavkas etc.--bear a much closer
resemblance to the *Neraides* of modern Greece than they do to their
sisters in other European lands. A similar resemblance is to be found
between the Greek Lamia and the Russian Baba Yaga. The ideas about
vampires are identical among the Greeks and Slavonians, the name for a
vampire being one of the very few words

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

of Slavonic origin in modern Greek. The ceremonies, also, attendant on
the building of a new house are almost the same, whether the builders be
Greeks or Slavonians. The three Baba Yagas of Russian Storyland are very
like the three *Moirais* who in Greece have succeeded to the old Fates.
And the Slavonic folk-beliefs with respect to the life beyond the grave,
like as they are to those held in Latin, Teutonic, and Celtic lands, yet
still more closely resemble those of the modern Greeks.

Since the Preface to the first edition was printed I have read Professor
Hilferding's most interesting account (in the March number of the
*Vyestnik Evropui*) of his recent expedition to the home of the
"Rhapsodists" described by Ruibnikof. I have, for the present, availed
myself in a few instances only of his criticisms, but they will be of
the utmost value to me when I am dealing with the "metrical romances" in
detail.

It may be as well to observe that, throughout the following chapters, I
have generally confined myself to stating, without criticizing, the
opinions held by the Russian Mythologists whom I have quoted.

        *April*, 1872.
