<H2 ALIGN="center">THE LAY OF V&Iacute;KAR<BR> <SMALL>[V&Iacute;KARSB&Aacute;LKR]</SMALL></H2>

<P>T<SMALL>HIS FINE</SMALL> but difficult retrospective monologue is unique in Old Germanic literature; not so much in manner as in matter. Its hero is, to be sure, the Danish national champion, Starkath, celebrated in song and story (though this lay is the only extant poetic treatment of the theme in the original language); but in this episode he has undergone a change to the sinister and demonic. The stern warrior and unbending protagonist of the olden simplicity of morals and customs, such as he appears in the <I>Lay of Ingiald</I> and elsewhere, has here become an uncouth half-troll of superhuman strength and somewhat dubious, Ahasveric nature. But the lay bespeaks an unexpected sympathy for this composite character of mixed heroism and baseness. His crime, the most heinous, according to Old Germanic ethics, of treacherously slaying his leader and foster brother to whom he is, moreover, genuinely attached because he owes to him his awakening to the heroic life&#8212;this crime is not to be expiated by &#8220;repentance.&#8221; To be sure, the accompanying story, both in the <I>Gautreks saga,</I> in which the lay is interwoven, and in Saxo seeks at least to motivate, and thus palliate, the deed by laying the blame on &Oacute;thin<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A>&#8212;in all the Starkath lays he is the instigator to strife. But, of course, it is the troll nature that reveals itself finally, making him a &#8220;nithing.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;As to the prose of the <I>Gautreks saga</I> and the similar story of Saxo,<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> it seems to occupy a middle ground in technique: it is not mainly supererogatory and explicatory stage direction, as in the oldest lays&#8212;say, the <I>Lays of Skirnir,</I> of <I>Volund;</I> nor a wordy setting for lays elaborating, and based on, themes taken from it&#8212;as, say, the <I>Lay of Hi&aacute;lmar;</I> but has an independent value beside the lay, furnishing legendary facts which the lay may not even hint at, just as the lay in its turn is independent

of the prose. Hence a full account is given below of the somewhat complicated story.</P>

<P>&#8195;There is hardly a question about the Icelandic origin, say in the twelfth century, of this vigorous and pithy poem. The poor state of transmission necessitates a number of drastic emendations. <I>Fornyrthislag,</I> with a few <I>kvithuh&aacute;ttr</I> lines interspersed, is the meter employed.</P>

<P>&#8195;As the <I>H&aacute;lf&#8217;s saga</I> relates, in its first chapter, the sacrifice of V&iacute;kar to &Oacute;thin came about in the following manner: Beautiful Geirhild managed to be taken as wife by King Alrek of Horthaland<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A> through &Oacute;thin&#8217;s help, on condition that she should call on the god in all difficulties. King Alrek was married already to Signy, the daughter of another king. The two wives could not agree, and Alrek promised that he would retain as his queen her who brewed the best ale against his return. Signy called on Freya, and Geirhild on &Oacute;thin. He added his spittle for yeast and said that for his help he must have that which was between her and the vat. Her ale proved to be the best. Then said Alrek:</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=10  align=center>

<TR><TD>&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Beware, Geirhild!&#8195;Good is this ale,<BR> if not any&#8195;evil follow:<BR> on high gallows&#8195;hanging I see<BR> thy son, Geirhild,&#8195;given to &Oacute;thin.&#8217;&#8201;&#8221;<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&#8195;That same year was born their son V&iacute;kar.</P>

<P>&#8195;As to Starkath&#8217;s origin and youth, we learn from the <I>Gautreks saga,</I> Chapter 3, that his grandfather, the giant Starkath, robbed a princess. Her father called for aid on Th&oacute;r, inveterate enemy of the giant tribe, who slew Starkath and led her back to her father. She gave birth to St&oacute;rvirk&#8212;&#8220;a handsome man, though black of hair, larger and stronger than other men.&#8221; He becomes right-hand man of King Harold of Agthir. In his turn, St&oacute;rvirk abducts Unni, Earl Freki&#8217;s daughter. This deed is avenged in time by the earl&#8217;s two sons, Fiori and F&yacute;ri. They burn St&oacute;rvirk and Unni in their hall, but the infant Starkath survives the fire and is adopted by King Harold. When three years old he is taken thence and fostered by an old man called Hrossh&aacute;rsgrani

<!------------------------page 20------------------------>

<A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A>

(<I>i.e.,</I> &Oacute;thin) at Ask,<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#note_4"><FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT></A> where he grows to the age of twelve, uncouth and huge of strength, but unaware of his powers. Under the same fosterage, and as hostage, grew up also V&iacute;kar, the son (here) of the same King Harold who, meanwhile, was treacherously slain by a neighboring king, Herthi&oacute;f. V&iacute;kar becomes a great leader and, joined by Starkath, whom he arouses to action, and eleven other young warriors, he avenges his father on Herthi&oacute;f and wins back his kingdom. On all his various ensuing expeditions Starkath is his trusted friend and companion and distinguishes himself by deeds of valor.</P>

<P>&#8195;One time, V&iacute;kar is held back with his fleet by contrary winds. They consult the oracle, which pronounces that &Oacute;thin must be appeased by the sacrifice of a man. The lot falls on King V&iacute;kar. That same night, Hrossh&aacute;rsgrani comes to Starkath and bids him follow him. They row to land. In a forest close at hand the gods are assembled, debating Starkath&#8217;s fate. &Oacute;thin, his foster father and protector, bestows on him all manner of good things, among them, the gift of poetry and three lives; but Th&oacute;r, &Oacute;thin&#8217;s antagonist, who moreover hates Starkath by reason of his giant origin, adds a misfortune to each gift: in each life he is to commit some dastardly deed. &Oacute;thin, in return for his gifts, bids Starkath send him V&iacute;kar. He consents. On the morrow, Starkath proposes to the fleet to make a mock sacrifice of V&iacute;kar to &Oacute;thin. He induces the king to let him fasten about his neck the soft guts of a calf, which he attaches to a slender branch of a tree. Then Starkath touched him with a reed and said: &#8220;now I give thee to &Oacute;thin,&#8221; and let go of the branch. But the branch lifted V&iacute;kar up quickly, the guts did their service, and the reed became a spear and pierced him.<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#note_5"><FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT></A> Starkath is outlawed and flees to the Swedish court where the taunting of inferior men arouses the &#8220;speechless poet&#8221; to unburthen his heart in the following monologue.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_25"></A><A HREF="#fr_25">25</A> &#8220;Base villain and coward&#8221;; a term difficult to render in English with one vocable. The stanza is defective, but evidently the happenings on the island to which &Oacute;thin took Starkath in the night are referred to. The broken style betrays the agitation of the speaker.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_29"></A><A HREF="#fr_29">29</A> The exact meaning of Old Norse <I>thulr</I> (here translated &#8220;poet&#8221;) is not certain, especially in this passage. If the meaning generally attributed to it, and here followed, is correct, then we may surinise that the gift of poetry given Starkath by &Oacute;thin was denied utterance by Th&oacute;r. The princes allow Starkath to remain silent, brooding over his treachery. For once, he bursts out&#8212;with self-accusation, not in repentance. And he means to relapse into silence, for a long time.</P>
