## THE OLD LAY OF BIARKI <span class="small">\[BIARKAMÓL HIN FORNU\]</span>

I<span class="small">N A</span> famous passage of his great book on the
*History of the Norwegian Kings* (*Heimskringla*), Snorri relates how,
early at morn, before the fatal battle of Stiklastad (1030), King Ólaf
the Saint asked his skald (Thórmóth Kólbrunarskálld) to intone a song;
whereupon he recited the *Old Biarkamól* (*Biarkamól hin fornu*) so that
all the army could hear it, and all were pleased; and the men called the
lay the *Exhortation of the Housecarls*<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1) (*Húskarla hvot*). In the *Legendary Saga
of Ólaf* we are told, furthermore, that when the king asked Thórmóth
what boon he desired, that loyal heart asked for naught better than to
be allowed to go before his king in battle, and that it might be granted
to him not to survive his lord. “This answer is in the very spirit of
the Biarkamól;”<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2) as was the poem
singularly well chosen, from out of the many Thórmóth no doubt knew, to
fit the occasion, for it is a high song of devotion unto death—and every
one felt the king’s to be a Lost Cause.

 Unfortunately, only inconsiderable fragments have come down to us of
this proud lay, though once it was known all over the North. For a
conception of the whole poem we are now dependent on Saxo’s spirited,
but very free and wordy, translation into Latin hexameters,<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3) and on the prolix and novelistic account
of the late *Hrólfs saga kraka*. Taking these as his basis, aided by a
strong poetic imagination, and with a profound knowledge of Old Norse
poetry as a corrective, the Danish scholar, Axel Olrik, essayed to
reconstruct the lay in its original form. As to the success of this
difficult piece of restoration, one may question a detail, here and
there, and yet agree that it is in the main true to the type, and
rejoice in the successful <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> restoration of a
noble poem. For its meter Olrik chose the *málaháttr,* irregularly
varying with *fornyrthislag,* which is seen in the few rests preserved.
As to structure the poem consists of three long and chiefly lyrical
parts of about equal size, separated from one another by brief dramatic
interludes. In this decided preponderance of lyric over dramatic
elements, as also in the leisurely breadth of the lyric passages, the
lay reminds one of the Anglo-Saxon epics rather than of the poems of the
Edda with their firmer structure and more energetic movement—whether now
this be due to Danish origin or to the early date of the Icelandic lay
used by Saxo. This is estimated by Olrik to be from about 900; but other
scholars incline to a much later date (ca. 1200).

 Putting together the accounts of Saxo and of the saga, the action is as
follows: The great hero-king Hrólf kraki,<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5) the son of Helgi (and nephew of Hróar), is
assailed in his hall at Leire during the night by his vassal Hiorvarth,
the ruler of the Gauts, who is incited to this treachery by his wife
Skuld, Hrólf’s own sister (or daughter). Hialti, a youthful champion in
Hrólf’s *hird,* arouses the inmates, and with taunting speeches exhorts
them to fight and die for their generous lord, rallying them again and
again. After a bitter struggle, Hiorvarth bursts through the castle
gate, Hrólf falls, but his warriors continue to fight. The castle is
fired, it seems by Hrólf’s own men. Meanwhile, Biarki, his greatest
champion, who has risen from poverty and finally married Hrólf’s sister
Hrút, lies in the hall in profound sleep, superinduced by Skuld’s magic.
He wakes at Hialti’s third call and plunges into battle. But it is too
late. Biarki sinks at his beloved chieftain’s head, Hialti at his feet.
When the battle dies down the mortally wounded Biarki is found by Hrút
and made to see Óthin riding over the battle field. Dying, he defies
him.<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6)

 The king remains throughout in the background, yet is the invisible
center, worthy of the loyalty unto death of such warriors. They but
reflect his glory—Biarki, towering up over the <span id="page_5">p.
5</span> rest of them, the stern warrior, unyielding in death and
defying even the king of the gods; beside him, brisk and steadfast,
Hialti, his younger companion at arms, whose ringing alarums are thrice
repeated, thanks to the happy retarding device of Biarki’s magic sleep.
Sharp lights fall even on the lesser characters, living and dead—on
wicked Skuld, “by evil norns for ill created,” and her husband
Hiorvarth, swayed by her “to his kin to be false, his king to betray”;
on the fierce warrlor Agnar who “laughs toward death”; on wretched King
Hrœrek and gold-greedy King Athisl. Scelles of the present and the past
flit by Hialti’s and Biarki’s inner vision, in their supreme hour—the
glorious and deed-filled life of the housecarls in field and in banquet
hall, under the eyes of the hero-king. Through their speeches we sense
the hurly-burly, and feel the progress, of the battle. We learn of all
the noble qualities which the upstanding, manly warrior-life of old
allowed to unfold, and above all we appreciate that there may be glory
in defeat.
