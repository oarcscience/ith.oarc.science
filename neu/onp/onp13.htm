<P>I<SMALL>F THE</SMALL> <I>Lay of Eric</I> was &#8220;made to order&#8221; by an unknown poet, as the eulogium of an unpopular, though brave, king, the <I>Lay of H&aacute;kon</I> is composed by the best-known of Norwegian skalds, unquestionably of his own accord, to commemorate his generally beloved leader. Hence the warmth of feeling, the note of personal loss, which pervades this splendid poem.</P>

<P>&#8195;H&aacute;kon, surnamed the Good, a child of Harold Hairfair&#8217;s old age, had been fostered by King &AElig;thelstan of England, and thus brought up a Christian. After overthrowing his half brother Eric he tried to introduce the new faith, but met with stubborn opposition and had to desist in order to keep his throne. He is described as an ideal ruler for the times, handsome, generous, warlike though not aggressive, during whose reign of twenty-six years Norway enjoyed comparative peace and good harvests. He repelled several attempts of the sons of Eric to repossess themselves of the kingdom with the help of the Danes, but was wounded in a (victorious) battle against them on the island of Storth in southwest Norway (961) and died soon thereafter.</P>

<P>&#8195;The poet Eyvind Finnsson was himself a distant relative of the king. We know that he lived in moderate circumstances and was a man of character. His (much-debated) epithet of <I>sk&aacute;ldaspillir</I> seems to mean &#8220;despoiler of skalds&#8221;; and if so, must have been given him by his enemies who readily fastened on the fact that his best works, <I>H&aacute;konarm&oacute;l</I> and <I>H&aacute;leygiatal</I>&#8212;the latter a long genealogical poem&#8212;are quite evidently patterned, the one after <I>Eiriksm&oacute;l,</I> the other, after <I>Ynglingatal,</I> by the earlier poet, Thi&oacute;th&oacute;lf of Hvin.</P>

<P>&#8195;If, notwithstanding this lack of original inspiration, the <I>Lay of H&aacute;kon</I> has been generally admired, then as well as now, this is due, not only to the genuine warmth and sincerity, but also

<!------------------------page 67------------------------>

<A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A>

to the superior artistry which makes it, all in all, perhaps the finest monument of its kind erected by Northern antiquity.</P>

<P>&#8195;Central, and similar down to details, in both <I>Eiriksm&oacute;l</I> and <I>H&aacute;konarm&oacute;l,</I> is the hero-king&#8217;s advent in Valholl; but whereas the former does not change scene (and thus achieves greater unity) the latter, with richer content, shifts from earth to heaven and back again to earth as it ebbs in the poet&#8217;s plaint over the loss of the peerless king. Also in style <I>H&aacute;konarm&oacute;l</I> shows more variety&#8212;consciously striven for. Thus, the straightforward and sober style of the narrative stanzas contrasts with the typically skaldic, baroque overloading of the battle-scene, clamorous with gorgeous and bizarre kennings, and that again with the highly charged dramatic force of the dialogues and the elegiac sorrow of the final dirge. The meter likewise shows a carefully considered correspondence to the style and theme&#8212;simple, impressive <I>li&oacute;thah&aacute;ttr</I> for the epic-dramatic and lyric portions, against the martial tramp and blare of <I>m&aacute;lah&aacute;ttr</I> descriptive of the carnage.</P>

<P>&#8195;Eyvind had no doubt both a political and an apologetic aim with his poem: it was to be a counterblast to <I>Eiriksm&oacute;l</I> and outdo it in splendor, but also to save the king&#8217;s good heathen reputation. If H&aacute;kon at his entrance in Valholl is suspicious of &Oacute;thin&#8217;s attitude and refuses to abandon his arms, he has abundant cause to fear the god&#8217;s wrath&#8212;his abortive defection from the heathen cause. And the good reception accorded him because he had &#8220;protected&#8221; the heathen fanes which, in fact, he had been powerless to destroy, may not have been altogether convincing to his contemporaries.<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> Also the heathen trappings, the copious reminiscences from such arch heathen poems as <I>Volusp&oacute;</I> and <I>H&oacute;vam&oacute;l,</I> the interest in the king shown by the  valkyries, the delegation to receive him composed of the gods Bragi and Herm&oacute;th&#8212;the same who was to fetch Baldr back from Hel<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A>&#8212;all seem deliberately chosen to link the king with the old religion and to rehabilitate him in the eyes of his people.</P>

He always was in the thick of the fray. Then Eyvind Finnsson (our poet) drew a hood over it. Whereupon Eyvind skreya (one of the enemy) cried out: &#8216;Is the king of Norway hiding now, or has he fled&#8212;else where is his golden helmet?&#8217; The king shouted: &#8216;Come forward hither if you would find the King of Norway,&#8217; and in the ensuing hand-to-hand fight cleft his skull with his sword.&#8221;</P>
