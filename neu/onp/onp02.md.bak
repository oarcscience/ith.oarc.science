## INTRODUCTION

T<span class="small">HE GROUP</span> of poems here offered comprises
practically all the more considerable (non-Skaldic) verse material not
in the Edda. It shows, even better than that remarkable collection, of
which it is intended to be the supplement, the wealth of independent
poetic inventions and forms that flourished in the Scandinavian North
before and immediately after the introduction of Christianity,
especially when we bear in mind that much is irretrievably lost.

 As to contents these poems, with respect to the first group of nine,
range from the genuinely “heroic,” realistic, dialogic-dramatic, earlier
lays (such as the *Biarkamól*) to the more “romantic,” legendary,
monologic-elegiac, retrospective, *later* lays (like *Hiálmar’s Death
Song*); though the lines of demarcation are by no means sharp and, in
fact, nearly every poem represents an individual combination of these
traits. A very different type of lay is seen in the three contemporary
encomiastic poems which celebrate the life and deeds of (historic)
rulers of Norway—the only non-Skaldic efforts of this *genre* so
exceedingly numerous in Old Norse literature. There is no common
denominator for the four poems at the end of the volume, except possibly
their arch-heathen character. As a finale the *Song of the Sun* marks
the transition to Christian spheres of thought.

 Common to all of this material, however, is its unliterary, that is,
unbookish, character which is in marked contrast to virtually all of
Anglo-Saxon epic literature, influenced as it is, to a greater or lesser
degree, by Christian or classical models. That is to say, we deal here
with the genuinely native expression of the North.

 In particular, the “heroic” lays—figuring prominently also in the Edda,
but occurring only sparsely in Anglo-Saxon and Old High German
literature—are the concentrated expression of the ethos of Germanic
antiquity, its poetry. The spirit which animates and dominates it is
that of warfare under the leadership of men of heroic stature, in an age
when the warlike nature <span id="page_xii">p. xii</span> of the
Germanic race received an additional impulsion, viz., in that vast
spectacle which we call the migration of nations; when through causes
unknown to us and on a scale nowhere else recorded in history, many
great and numerous peoples of Europe and Asia were set in motion and for
the space of centuries wandered about in search of new homes; when the
fortunes of war made swift kaleidoscopic changes in the map, and nations
rose and fell overnight.

 In such an age the purpose of song is not to beguile the time but to
give to listeners a heightened sense of reality, of the verities of life
lived nobly; to rouse emulation through a recital of the great deeds,
the tragic fate, of the ancestors. Small wonder that the watchwords of
life lived dangerously—of the maintenance of honor, even in defeat and
death, through courage, energetic activity, generosity, loyalty to king,
clan, friend—are dwelt upon to the exclusion of the gentler virtues of a
settled life; and natural, that in this song there are recurrent
patterns of action, such as the motives of revenge or lust for gold and
power; that there are types, such as the guileless hero-king, the old
wily despot, the stern grizzled warrior, rather than individuals; that
the scenes are largely restricted to banquet hall and battle field. As a
result, inevitably, a feeling of harsh and insistent monotony will be
the first impression on readers of this literature, until greater
familiarity with it will allow us, here too, to distinguish the
individual in the type.

 Turning to the technique employed in this literature, it will be noted
that practically all is direct speech, monologue or dialogue, with
hardly any narrative of action or description of scene or explanation of
motive. As in the ballad of later times, all this is implied and
suggested, frequently in a masterly fashion. To be sure, the whole art
practice is addressed to an audience perfectly acquainted with the
“story” (much as in our times a bygone generation was with biblical
scenes) and to whom, therefore, the expression of the feelings alone was
important. Often there is but one scene, dramatically tense, in which
the quintessence of a life discharges itself in a sudden flash.

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

 The vehicle for Old Germanic poetry is the alliterative verse, which in
Old Norse poetic monuments is gathered into various stanzaic aggregates.
Basic for it is the “short-line” of two stresses and an indeterminate
number of unstressed syllables. Two such “short-lines,” linked by
alliteration—initial consonant riming with identical initial consonant,
initial vowel with any initial vowel (note well, of stressed syllables
only)—form a “long-line.” Four of these, again, make up a stanza, which
is called *fornyrthislag,* “old-lore meter” (as in *Hiálmar’s Death
Song*), if the number of unstressed syllables in each “short-line” is
restricted, and *málaháttr,* “speech meter” (as in stanzas 3-8 of
*Hákonarmól*), if the number of unstressed syllables is expanded.<span
id="page_xiii_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_xiii_note_1.md) The measure called
*lióthaháttr,* “chant meter” (as in *Sólarlióth*) is peculiar in that
each distich is formed by a “long-line” followed by a “full-line” with
(generally) three stresses<span
id="page_xiii_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_xiii_note_2.md) and alliterating in
itself. It is the (not invariable) rule that the alliteration in the
second (even) “short-line” falls on the first stress only, whereas the
first (odd) “short-line” may have two alliterative syllables.

 With respect to the stress it is important to remember that there is no
modern regularity, whether of its position in the line or of its
alternating with unstressed syllable(s). Of the six mutations possible
with a minimum of two accented and two unaccented syllables within a
“short-line,” only one is not permitted, viz., x x x´ x´. All others
occur, viz., x´ x x´ x—x´ x´ x x—x x´ x´ x—x´ x x x´—x x´ x x´—<span
id="page_xiii_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_xiii_note_3.md) and will be found in
this version.<span id="page_xiii_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_xiii_note_4.md)

 With slight exceptions, the poems here dealt with belong to Eddic art
practice, which differs from Skaldic poetry in several <span
id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> respects. Formally, Eddic verse occurs in
the relatively simple meters outlined above; stylistically, it is for
the most part in direct speech and uses few and relatively simple
kennings. (A kenning is a figure of speech in which a person or thing is
described or named by somebody or something else; in other words, it is
a condensed simile. Thus, we may call a football player a “knight of the
grid,” and a Norwegian, a “son of the Vikings.” In similar fashion, in
the old poems, e.g., “battle” is called “Hild’s (a valkyrie’s) play” or
“the meeting of swords,” etc., and Óthin, “Sleipnir’s rider” or “Frigg’s
husband,” etc.). Skaldic poetry, on the other hand, is characterized,
chiefly, by an exorbitant use of frequent and complicated kennings (cf.
the purely Skaldic stanzas 6-8 of *Hákonarmól*). Also, the meters are
generally more intricate, and there is scarcely ever direct speech.

 

 The principal thing to keep in mind when reading Old Germanic verse is
that, in consonance with the dramatic-passionate contents, the stress is
dynamic, emphasizes content. Or, as it is better stated negatively: no
stress, and therefore no alliteration, may fall on elements without an
important increment of meaning. Obviously then, as we should not be
misled, either, by our modern insistence on regularity of stress and
equal length of lines, this verse is utterly alien to our ears. Then why
translate into it, rather than into some more familiar form, or else why
not resign oneself to prose? Because, I contend, no other verse form
will approximate the feel of Old Germanic poetry: translation into any
other form, however palatable in itself, radically fails in that
respect. Hence, if it is worth while to become acquainted with Old
Germanic poetry, it would seem worth while also to undergo the effort of
reading the verse form in which it was given expression.

 Similarly with the language. For heightened impressiveness and
elevation, poets have always drawn on the hoarded treasure of their
speech, paying with doubloons and ducats and pieces of eight, rather
than with the current and trivial coin of the realm. So did the men who
indited these lays. Hence I make <span id="page_xv">p. xv</span> no
apology for occasional archaisms in my endeavor to recreate them on the
speech level of the original. In this as in following the old metrical
scheme I have preferred a true, rather than a smooth, rendering.

 As readers I have had in mind, while preparing the introducions and the
notes, especially the fairly numerous class of those interested in
Anglo-Saxon literature, and the specialists in Old Norse not at all, and
have therefore avoided dwelling on moot points. While of course leaning
on the explorations of predecessors, I have generally sailed my own
course—between reefs innumerable—with only occasional reference to the
tracks of others.<span id="page_xv_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_xv_note_5.md)
Nevertheless I am afraid that in the notes I have erred both in giving
too little and too much. On the one hand the whole world and
*Weltanschauung* of the ancient North clamored for elucidation; on the
other, as I well know, a plethora of notes is a weariness unto the
flesh, besides interfering with the pleasure of reading.

NOTE

 *Pronunciation*.—The acute accent over vowels signifies length. They
are to be voiced in the Continental fashion, as in German or Italian.
*G* is always hard, *s,* always surd. Word accent is invariably on the
first syllable. The diphthongs ia, io, ill are rising.

 *Eddic Poems*.—References to the Eddic poems are to the author’s
translation, *The Poetic Edda* (University of Texas Press, 1928).

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

<span id="page_xiii_note_1"></span>[1](#page_xiii_fr_1.md) A few examples
of *kvithuháttr,* in which the odd lines have three, the even four,
syllables, are found in the *Lay of Víkar*.

<span id="page_xiii_note_2"></span>[2](#page_xiii_fr_2.md) The efforts,
notably of Heusler, to show that this line is but an expanded two-stress
line, fail to convince me and, in fact, seem contradicted by the
evidence. Cf. *The Journal of English and Germanic Philology,* 1931, pp.
475 f.

<span id="page_xiii_note_3"></span>[3](#page_xiii_fr_3.md) Adherence to
these “Sievers Types” is not a matter of credulity on my part, as some
of the critics of my Edda translation seem to imply, but of simple
observation of the rhythmic facts.

<span id="page_xiii_note_4"></span>[4](#page_xiii_fr_4.md) The question of
long or short syllable need not concern the reader of the translation.

<span id="footnotes_page_xv">p. xv</span>

<span id="page_xv_note_5"></span>[5](#page_xv_fr_5.md) The originals
(nearly all) are most easily accessible in Heusler-Ranisch, *Eddica
Minora,* and (all) in F. Jónsson’s *Den Norsk-Islandske
Skjaldedigtning*.
