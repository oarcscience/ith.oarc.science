## THE LAY OF INGIALD

I<span class="small">N THE</span> sixth book of Saxo Grammaticus’s
*Gesta Danorum* there are embedded, in the narrative of the Danish hero,
Starkath’s, life and deeds, two extensive poems, the *Lay of Ingiald*
and *Starkath’s Death Song;* and a third lay, somewhat related to the
Icelandic *Víkarsbálk,* is to be inferred from Saxo’s prose narrative.
That there were current lays about Starkath, not only in Scandinavia,
but also in Anglo-Saxon England, brought thither from the old home, and
that they were in favor, is amply evident from that reproachful passage
in one of Alcuin’s letters:<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) “Quid
enim Hinieldus cum Christo? Angusta est domus; utrosque tenere non
poterit”—What hath Ingiald to do with Christ? Small is the house, it
will not hold both—even if we did not have the well-known Ingeld episode
of *Bēowulf* (2024-2069).

 Like the *Biarkamól,* and likewise Danish in origin, the *Lay of
Ingiald* is an “exhortation”—even more narrowly so—not to loyal devotion
unto death in the king’s cause, but addressed to the son of the slain
father, to bestir himself to revenge. Both the situation and the
reaction to it are typical of the Germanic North in pre-Christian times.

 According to the oldest, and no doubt most original, account as found
in *Bēowulf,* the matter is as follows: In a great battle with the
Heathobards,<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) their king, Frōda, was
slain. In order to effect a reconciliation between the two hostile
nations, the Danish king, Hrōthgār, gave his daughter, Frēawaru, in
marriage to Ingeld, the son of Frōda; but at the marriage feast—it
seems, in the royal hall of the Heathobards—a young warrior, stung to
the quick by the repeated eggings on of an old warrior, slays one of the
Danish company, in order to avenge his father. Ingeld’s love of the
Danish princess “cools” (*i.e.,* he puts her away), the feud breaks out
again which according to *Wīdsīth,* ends with the disastrous defeat of
the Heathobards before Heorot, the royal hall of the Danes.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

 This matter is significantly changed, and condensed to far greater
dramatic effect, in the Old Danish lay. There, the injured party are the
Danes, the ignominious peace and marriage lies in the past. Starkath,
the stern old warrior and companion in arms of Fróthi, arrives incognito
in Leire, where a sumptuous banquet is being given by Ingiald to his
brothers-in-law (here called the sons of Sverting), and arouses him by
bitter denunciation of his supineness to slay them and put away their
sister, his wife. To the rôle of the formidable hereditary enemies of
the land have succeeded the Germans<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md)—as well they might under the powerful and
aggressive (Saxon) Ottones, who finally compelled the Danes to accept
their overlordship and Christianity. The lay has gained, furthermore, by
the fierce denunciation of the new and hated Southron ways and by
concentrating this invective on Ingiald; who avenges himself on the
spot.

 Starkath’s own personality is kept in the background, though he is
unmistakably felt to be *the* representative of the older and better
ideals of the Viking Age. Since this age, to which the lay harks back
with such approbation, had come to an end in the ninth century, after
the conquest and settlement of the western and northern Atlantic
littoral; since the poem is still thoroughly heathen in spirit; and
since the fear and hatred of the Saxon and his ways could have arisen
only after the accession of the Saxon emperors, it is safe to conclude
that the lay was composed during the tenth century.

 As for its contents, we are altogether dependent on Saxo’s prolix and
highly rhetorical Latin version—in Sapphic stanzas and hexameters.<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md) From these, Olrik by judicious reduction
brought out the lay approximately as it may have come to the knowledge
of Saxo. The version here offered leans on Olrik’s, but is shorter by
nine stanzas through the elimination of some fulsome details improbable
in an old lay and, especially, the omission of the weak ending which in
Olrik’s version mars the fine climax of exultation over the revenge
accomplished, which Starkath calls on Óthin to witness.
