## THE CURSE OF BUSLA <span class="small">\[BUSLUBŒN\]</span>

T<span class="small">HE MYSTERIOUS</span> power of the word, whether for
prayer, benediction or malediction, has been felt at all times. And at
all times, both good wishes and imprecations have been apt to clothe
themselves in some kind of metric-rhythmic form for greater
expressiveness and impressiveness, for enhancing their magic power. And
no sooner is the “formula” fixed than the need is felt to perpetuate the
passing sound of words of such power and value by symbols through which
their effect may be multiplied, and even conveyed to some distance in
time and space. In the Germanic North the runes—alphabetic signs which
were adopted, it seems, from some Mediterranean alphabet, say, about the
beginning of our era<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1)—served this
purpose, especially when verbal curses had failed.<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2) They were scratched (“written”) on stone
and wood and bone and metal, on weapons, clothing, implements of all
kinds to be used by him in whose favor, or against whom, the magic was
to take effect.

 Old High German and Anglo-Saxon literature offers us a wealth of
examples of healing, or defensive, magic formulae—some of them of
literary value, like the Merseburg Incantations; but for extended
instances of offensive magic we must go to Old Norse literature. The
Eddic poems abound with magic of all sorts. As illustrations of
“offensive” magic we may point out the “classic” curses of Skírnir and
of Sigrún, and the shorter malisons of *Lokasenna,* *Fiólsvinnsmól,*
*Atlamól*.<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3) A monument wholly devoted
to the purpose of wishing ill “on” some one, and perhaps the most
instructive of its kind in literature, though admittedly on a lower
plane in æsthetic value than those mentioned, <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> is the *Buslubœn* of the *Bósa saga,* a Romantic fornaldar
saga (legendary tale) of the thirteenth century. Neither is the curse,
as a whole, much older; witness certain phrases and views; which,
however, does not preclude some portions breathing rank age-old
heathendom. It will be noted, by the way, that the last stanza,
containing the fiercest rune-magic, does not seem to belong here
originally; for whereas all the others contain some proviso, the
effectiveness of this curse is dependent, not on King Hring complying
with Busla’s demands, but on his not solving the runic riddle. Very
likely, the monument is fragmentary, whether through the pretended
squeamishness of the clerical scribe or, as seems more likely, through
his not remembering more.

 The saga tells how, impelled by untoward circumstances, young Herrauth
and his companion at arms, Bósi, fight a pitched battle with Herrauth’s
father, King Hring. They are subdued and bound, to be put to death on
the morrow; but old Busla, Bósi’s fostermother, a hag most experienced
in witchcraft, approaches the king at night “and began that curse which
is since called Busla’s Curse. It has become famous. In it are many
turns which are bad for Christians to have in their mouths. And this is
the beginning of it:”

1

“Here liest thou, Hring, Lord of the Gauts,<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4)  
the most headstrong of human kind—  
minded, to-morrow to murther thy son:  
will this foul deed be told far and wide.  

2

“Hear thou Busla’s song<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5)— ’t will be
sung full soon;  
so that it be heard the whole world about—  
harmful to him who heareth it,  
but fellest for him whom fain I would curse.  

3

“May wights be wildered, and wonders happen,  
may cliffs be shattered and the world shaken,  
may the weather worsen, and wonders happen,  
<span id="page_78">p. 78</span> but thou, King Hring, forgive
Herrauth,  
 and eke to Bósi no ill threaten.  

4

“O’er thy chest such charms now chant I shall<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6)  
that evil asps shall eat thy heart,  
that thy ears henceforth shall hear no more,  
and thy seeing eyes leave their sockets,  
 but thou with Bósi wilt bear, hereafter,  
 nor harbor hate against Herrauth, either.  

5

“If boat thou sailest, shall burst the ropes,  
if boat thou steerest, shall break the tholepins<span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7)—  
shall the sail-cloth be slit and sag downward,  
and all the tackle be torn asunder,  
 but thou harbor no hate against Herrauth,  
 and but thou with Bósi will bear hereafter.  

6

“Shall the reins ravel when thou ridest forth,  
shall horses go halt, and nags be hamstrung<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8)—  
shall both highways and bridle-paths  
take thee where trolls may tear thee straightway,  
 but thou with Bósi wilt bear hereafter,  
 nor harbor hate against Herrauth, either.  

7

“May thy bed be for thee like burning straw,  
thy high-seat unsteady like heaving sea-wave.  
Yet woe awaits thee much worse by far:  
if with maid thou meanest a man’s joy to have,  
shalt lose thy way then:<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9) doest wish
to hear more?”  

 (The king attempts to silence her and to rise, but finds himself
charmed fast to his bed and unable to wake his attendants. As he is
still unwilling to give in, Busla chants the second part of her curse:)

shall all straws stick thee,<span id="fr_10"></span><a href="#note_10">10</a> all storms stun thee:<br />
and woe worth thee but my will thou doest!”<br />
</td>
</tr>

 (Then the king is ready to pardon his son Herrauth, but to declare Bósi
outlaw.) Then started she to chant what is called *Syrpuvers* (*i.e.*,
“the Verses of Syrpa”), in which is the strongest magic, so that it is
not permitted to chant them after nightfall; and toward the end it goes
like this:

<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

I shall show them to thee unshackled all.<br />

shall ravening hounds rive thee to pieces,<br />
and thy soul sink to hell-fire!”<span id="fr_11"></span><a href="#note_11">11</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 (Then, after the king’s swearing an oath that he will do her bidding,
she “takes the curse off.”)

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_76">p. 76</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1) The theory long accepted, that they
originated through some adaptation of a Greek or Latin alphabet by the
Goths along the Black Sea has recently been challenged with some force,
and an earlier origin from Etruscan or Thracian script suggested.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2) Cf. *Skírnismól,* 38, note.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3) *Skírnismól,* *Helgakvitha
Hundingsbana,* II, 30-33; *Lokasenna,* 65; *Fiolsvinnsmól,* 45;
*Atlamól,* 30. Cf. also *Hervararkvitha,* 12, 21.

<span id="footnotes_page_77">p. 77</span>

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4) The inhabitants of Gautland, the
present Swedish province of Gotland.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5) Literally, “prayer”; but the
incantation is meant, of course.

<span id="footnotes_page_78">p. 78</span>

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6) The translation of the line is
doubtful.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7) In Germanic antiquity, vessels were
steered, not with a rudder, but with an extra oar on the “starboard,”
*i.e.,* the steering side. Oars were held by thongs to the tholepins.
Cf. *Haraldskvæthi,* 17; *Atlamól,* 34.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8) Literally, “become weak.”

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9) To be understood in *malam partem*.

<span id="footnotes_page_79">p. 79</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10) Proverbial for all things “going
against one.”

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11) There follow these runic signs:  
**ᚱ᛫ᚨ᛫ᚦ᛫ᚴ᛫ᚢ᛫ ᛬ ᛁᛁᛁᛁᛁ ᛬ ᛍᛍᛍᛍᛍ ᛬ ᛐᛐᛐᛐᛐ ᛬ ᛁᛁᛁᛁᛁ ᛬ ᛚᛚᛚᛚᛚ**  
 As a solution, Uhland (*Schriften,* VI, 248) suggested that with the
letters of the first group of runes successively placed before the five
others, the six words (or “fellows,” as the text has it) resulting would
be *ristill* “plowshare,” *aistill* “testicle,” *thistill* “thistle,”
*kistill* “box,” *mistill* “mistletoe,” *vistill* “?”—words whose sense
in *malam partem* is still partly discernible.
