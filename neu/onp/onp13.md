## THE LAY OF HÁKON <span class="small">\[HÁKONARMÓL\] B<span class="small">Y</span> E<span class="small">YVIND</span> F<span class="small">INNSSON SKÁLDASPILLIR</span></span>

I<span class="small">F THE</span> *Lay of Eric* was “made to order” by
an unknown poet, as the eulogium of an unpopular, though brave, king,
the *Lay of Hákon* is composed by the best-known of Norwegian skalds,
unquestionably of his own accord, to commemorate his generally beloved
leader. Hence the warmth of feeling, the note of personal loss, which
pervades this splendid poem.

 Hákon, surnamed the Good, a child of Harold Hairfair’s old age, had
been fostered by King Æthelstan of England, and thus brought up a
Christian. After overthrowing his half brother Eric he tried to
introduce the new faith, but met with stubborn opposition and had to
desist in order to keep his throne. He is described as an ideal ruler
for the times, handsome, generous, warlike though not aggressive, during
whose reign of twenty-six years Norway enjoyed comparative peace and
good harvests. He repelled several attempts of the sons of Eric to
repossess themselves of the kingdom with the help of the Danes, but was
wounded in a (victorious) battle against them on the island of Storth in
southwest Norway (961) and died soon thereafter.

 The poet Eyvind Finnsson was himself a distant relative of the king. We
know that he lived in moderate circumstances and was a man of character.
His (much-debated) epithet of *skáldaspillir* seems to mean “despoiler
of skalds”; and if so, must have been given him by his enemies who
readily fastened on the fact that his best works, *Hákonarmól* and
*Háleygiatal*—the latter a long genealogical poem—are quite evidently
patterned, the one after *Eiriksmól,* the other, after *Ynglingatal,* by
the earlier poet, Thióthólf of Hvin.

 If, notwithstanding this lack of original inspiration, the *Lay of
Hákon* has been generally admired, then as well as now, this is due, not
only to the genuine warmth and sincerity, but also <span id="page_67">p.
67</span> to the superior artistry which makes it, all in all, perhaps
the finest monument of its kind erected by Northern antiquity.

 Central, and similar down to details, in both *Eiriksmól* and
*Hákonarmól,* is the hero-king’s advent in Valholl; but whereas the
former does not change scene (and thus achieves greater unity) the
latter, with richer content, shifts from earth to heaven and back again
to earth as it ebbs in the poet’s plaint over the loss of the peerless
king. Also in style *Hákonarmól* shows more variety—consciously striven
for. Thus, the straightforward and sober style of the narrative stanzas
contrasts with the typically skaldic, baroque overloading of the
battle-scene, clamorous with gorgeous and bizarre kennings, and that
again with the highly charged dramatic force of the dialogues and the
elegiac sorrow of the final dirge. The meter likewise shows a carefully
considered correspondence to the style and theme—simple, impressive
*lióthaháttr* for the epic-dramatic and lyric portions, against the
martial tramp and blare of *málaháttr* descriptive of the carnage.

 Eyvind had no doubt both a political and an apologetic aim with his
poem: it was to be a counterblast to *Eiriksmól* and outdo it in
splendor, but also to save the king’s good heathen reputation. If Hákon
at his entrance in Valholl is suspicious of Óthin’s attitude and refuses
to abandon his arms, he has abundant cause to fear the god’s wrath—his
abortive defection from the heathen cause. And the good reception
accorded him because he had “protected” the heathen fanes which, in
fact, he had been powerless to destroy, may not have been altogether
convincing to his contemporaries.<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md)
Also the heathen trappings, the copious reminiscences from such arch
heathen poems as *Voluspó* and *Hóvamól,* the interest in the king shown
by the valkyries, the delegation to receive him composed of the gods
Bragi and Hermóth—the same who was to fetch Baldr back from Hel<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md)—all seem deliberately chosen to link the
king with the old religion and to rehabilitate him in the eyes of his
people.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

 The complete poem is found in Snorri Sturlason’s History of the
Norwegian Kings (*Heimskringla*), at the end of *Hákonarsaga gótha*.
Portions of it are transmitted also in *Fagrskinna*.

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md) Though we may in this stanza also
see a reflection on his successors who ravaged the sanctuaries and hid
the gold.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md) Cf. *Baldr’s Dreams*.

<span id="footnotes_page_68">p. 68</span>

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) “The God of the Gauts.” *i.e.,*
Óthin.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) Valkyries.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) Yngvi generally stands for Freyr in
his capacity of progenitor of the Swedish kings. Here, however, he
stands for Óthin, the progenitor of the royal race of Norway.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) Hákon. Biorn was one of the many
sons of Harold Fairhair.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) Cf. *Haraldskvæthi*, note 37.
Horthaland is here substituted for the Rogaland of the text. It is
directly south of the latter.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) The change to the golden helmet (in
the next stanza) has been referred to an episode of the battle as told
by Snorri: “Hákon was more easily recognized than other men, and his
helmet glittered when the sun shone on it. He always was in the thick of
the fray. Then Eyvind Finnsson (our poet) drew a hood over it. Whereupon
Eyvind skreya (one of the enemy) cried out: ‘Is the king of Norway
hiding now, or has he fled—else where is his golden helmet?’ The king
shouted: ‘Come forward hither if you would find the King of Norway,’ and
in the ensuing hand-to-hand fight cleft his skull with his sword.”

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md) This was not uncommon with fierce
warriors, in the heat of battle.

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md) Viz., against the sons of Eric.

<span id="footnotes_page_69">p. 69</span>

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md) At his departure from England,
his foster father, King Æthelstan, gave him the sword Quernbiter with
which Hákon is said to have cut a millstone in two.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md) Swords frequently had rings on
the hilt, for carrying.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md) The following stanzas are
examples of Skaldic style overloaded with kennings; though not as
complicated and disjointed as was believed until recently. The Týr
(god)-of-shields (or rings) is a kenning for “warrior.” In ordinary
language the first part of the stanza says that the shields and the
heads of Northmen were trodden (hewed) by the hardened steel of the king
(Kock).

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14.md) Viz., of Storth.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15.md) The serried shields thrown about
the king.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16.md) Kenning for “sword.”

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17.md) Kenning for “battle-axe.”

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18.md) Kenning for “blood.”

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19.md) *I.e.,* the mutual attacks. The
difficulties, both of interpretation and translation, are considerable.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20.md) Kenning for “battle.”

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21.md) Viz., dying.

<span id="footnotes_page_70">p. 70</span>

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22.md) Cf. *Eiriksmól*, 7,
[note](onp12.htm#note_6.md), for the conception implied.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23.md) *I.e.,* Spear-Skogul.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24.md) “God of gods,” *i.e.,* Óthin.

<span id="footnotes_page_71">p. 71</span>

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25.md) “Hero.”

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26.md) Cf. *Hovamól,* 1. I follow Kock’s
suggestion.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27.md) There is reference here,
probably, to his favor with the gods, manifest in good harvests and
general prosperity.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28.md) Cf. *Voluspó* 36, 54: not till
the end of the world will a better ruler come.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29.md) Patently, a reminiscence of the
famous stanzas 77, 78 of *Hóvamól*.

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30.md) This is, very likely, an allusion
to the lawless times that followed the reign of Hákon.
