## THE OATH OF TRUCE <span class="small">\[TRYGGTHAMÓL\]</span>

P<span class="small">RIMITIVE</span> law, based as it is on the
profoundest ethical convictions and sentiments of the race, has many
elements in common with poetry. Especially is this the case when the law
seeks to instance, or motivate, or elaborate, sanctions or punishments.
Thus we find embedded in the Icelandic laws, following a treatment of
weregild or composition for manslaughter, etc., a formula of peace<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) which both in form and spirit is
essentially poetic. Indeed, when passion infuses itself—as where a
mighty curse is called down on the violator of these oaths—heights of
truly great poetry are reached: for the benefit of both witnesses and
the interested parties, the abstract “everywhere” in which outlawry will
be visited on him is translated into concrete images which pass before
the mind’s eye in an artless series of vivid impressions from the life
of man, the boundless earth, the sky and the sea.

 Like other, similar, snatches in the laws, the *Tryggthamól* are most
instructive to the student of Old Germanic poetry in showing a more
primitive stage of alliterative verse than that seen in epic or lay.
There is as yet no regularity of metrical line, though a few normal
long-lines do occur;<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) far less, any
strophic structure. Still, alliteration has here its basic function of
marking and reinforcing the natural stress, variation (parallelism)
shows the instinctive fondness of the race for dwelling on favorite
objects or conceptions; and the occasionally magnificent rhythm
anticipates the effects of the more regular art practice to come. In
other words, there are here, as in embryo, all the peculiar and stirring
elements of Old Germanic poetry.

 It is reasonable to suppose that these oaths are age-old and were
brought over to Iceland from the common home in <span id="page_81">p.
81</span> Norway.<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md) Certainly the
groundstock is heathen; the references to Christian belief and practices
are but natural later accretions.

 The version here translated is that of the so-called *Konungabók* or
“Kings’ Book” MS of the *Grágás*,<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md) a
twelfth-century compilation of Icelandic laws. A shorter version exists
also in the so-called *Statharhólsbók,* or “Book of Statharhól
Bishopric” MS of the *Grágás*. Besides, we have versions with important
divergences in the seventy-second chapter of the *Grettis saga* and the
thirty-third chapter of the *Heitharvíga saga*.

There has been strife between N. N. and N. N.; but now peace has been
made between them,  
  and amends made  
  as the domesmen deemed  
  and the judges judged  
  and the awarders weighed.  
  Hath the offer been taken  
  as even-handed,  
  with full fees  
  and forth-paid ounces,<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5.md)  
  to them handseled  
  who were to have them.  
Ye shall henceforth be men  
  at peace and pledged  
  at ale and eating,  
  at thing and at folk-meet,  
  at kirk-going  
  and in king’s hall;  
and wherever men gather together, there shall ye be so agreed as though
this matter had never come between you. Ye shall share  
  both steel and steaks  
  and all the things  
   <span id="page_82">p. 82</span> that are betwixt you,  
  like friends<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7.md) and not like foes.  
And if, later, strife arise between you twain and things be not in good
case, then shall it  
  be settled by fees,  
  but no swords reddened.  
But that one of you  
  who is traitor to this truce  
  and goes against word given,  
he shall be  
  as ill outlaw  
  hunted and hated,  
  so far as men ever  
  an outlaw hunt,  
  as Christian folk  
  visit churches,  
  as Heathen folk  
  have hallowed shrines,  
  as fire doth flame  
  and earth is green,—  
  as babe calleth mother,  
  and mother suckles child,  
  as folks kindle fire,  
  ships sail the sea,  
  and shields are borne,  
  as the sun shineth,  
  snow drifteth,  
  Finn glideth,<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8.md)  
  fir-tree groweth,  
  as falcon flie’th  
  on a fair summer-day<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9.md)  
  with a brisk-blowing breeze  
  under both his wings,  
   <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> as the sky arches  
  and earth is tilled,  
  wind doth howl,  
  waters flow seaward,  
  and seed is sown.  
  He shall shun  
  churches and churched ones,  
  God’s house and men’s homes—  
  every abode  
  but hell only.  
Now hold ye both this book<span id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10.md) on
which lies also the money which N. N. offers as redress for himself and
his heir.  
  born or unborn,  
  begotten or unbegotten,  
  named or unnamed.  
N. N. accepts this composition, and N. N. swears an everlasting peace.
It is to hold  
  the while earth lasteth,  
  and live on it men.  
Now, then, are N. N. and N. N.  
  agreed and at one,  
  where’er they may meet—  
  on shore or on water,  
  on ship or on snow-shoe,  
  on high sea or on horseback,  
  to share in the rowing  
  or in baling out,  
  on bench or on deck,  
  if need there be,  
  at one with each other  
  as is father with son  
  or son with father,  
  in all their dealings.  
Now N. N. and N. N. shall clasp hands: hold ye well this truce, to the
liking of Christ and of all the men who have now heard this oath of
peace.  
   <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> May he have God’s grace  
  who holds this truce,  
  but his wrath, who rives  
  rightful truce—  
  his grace, he who holds it!  
Be ye now happy and at peace!  
  Witnesses be we  
  who about you stand!
