## HILDIBRAND’S DEATH SONG

T<span class="small">HIS FINE</span> fragment is an offshoot of the
South Germanic, and ultimately Gothic, heroic motif best known to us
from the famous old German lay in which the greatest tragedy conceivable
to the Germanic mind, kinsman slain by kinsman—son by father—has found
classic expression. There, Hiltibrant, the grey-haired warrior,
returning from long exile, meets his fiery young son Hadubrant,
recognizes, and makes advances to him but is rebuffed and, to save his
honor, is compelled to fight and slay him. In the Old Norse poem it is
Hildibrand who is slain, by his half brother, Ásmund; and the previous
death of Hildibrand’s son at his own hands (stanza 6) is right only as a
kind of rudiment. The lay is found, in a much mutilated condition, in
the *Asmunda saga kappabana* (“the Saga of Ásmund, Slayer of
Champions”), a *fornaldarsaga* which must have existed in the twelfth
century about as it has come down to us, since it is found in a very
similar form in Saxo’s *Danish History*<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) which was composed toward the end of that
century. This version also contains a Latin paraphrase of the lay, in
hexameters, agreeing with our fragment down to verbal details; so that a
tentative reconstruction of certain lines and stanzas is justifiable.

 The saga tells how King Buthli’s daughter, Hild—in the lay and in Saxo
she is called Drótt—by the fortunes of war is married successively to
two kings. Her sons by these, Hildibrand and Ásmund,<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) grow up in ignorance of one another. Both
become great warriors. Hildibrand is attached to the Hunnish court,
Ásmund becomes the champion of two Saxon lords whose realm has been
reduced by Hildibrand. He takes up Hildibrand’s standing challenge to
single combat; but as Hildibrand through a description has recognized
Ásmund he avoids him and sends his berserkers instead. Only when these
have all succumbed does he issue forth himself to the struggle which he
knows will be fatal to one or both of them. Wounded unto death,
Hildibrand addresses the victor:

 According to the saga, Ásmund—ill-pleased with his deed—fulfills his
brother’s dying wish. But when he returns from the combat he scornfully
remarks about the “odd custom” of sending two men against one.<span

the fourth stands out with peculiar vigor.

<span id="footnotes_page_53">p. 53</span>

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) Supplied by the translator after
Saxo, lines 1-7.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) I accept E. A. Kock’s emendation.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) Do., after lines 10-16.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) Two wondrous swords to which,
however, a curse had been attached, had been forged for Buthli by two
dwarfs. They came into the possession of the half brothers. In the duel,
Hildibrand’s is shattered.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) Supplied after lines 18-19 of Saxo’s
paraphrase.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) The recurrence of “by my head”
renders the line suspicious. In Saxo’s verses the dying Hildeglr’s
shield is adorned with the figures of the warriors he had slain—among
them his own son: “in the middle (panel) stands the picture of my son,
drawn with great art, whom this hand of mine snatched out of life.” In
the saga, Hildibrand is represented as slaying his son in the berserker
rage which overcomes him before going to meet Ásmund.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) There is nothing in Saxo’s version
to suggest a lacuna here.

<span id="footnotes_page_54">p. 54</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md) It being customary, rather, that
the victor despoils the vanquished of his armor.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md) Freely supplied by the translator
after Saxo’s lines 31-34.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md) Which is dishonorable, according
to the code of the single combat.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md) Adopting Detter’s and Heinzel’s
emendation of the passage.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14.md) The strange contradiction in this
line might, possibly, be interpreted ironically as meaning that they
picked him as their opponent.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15.md) In the original *dísir,* tutelary
spirits in the shape of women, guiding and warning one.

<span id="footnotes_page_55">p. 55</span>

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16.md) This epithet shows the same,
older, conception as the *Lay of Hiltibrant* where Hiltibrant is called
“*alter Hun*”; whereas in the saga he is represented as youthful,
notwithstanding his having a grown son.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17.md) Or “hard to overcome.” The line
seems corrupt.

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18.md) F. Jónsson’s emendation.
