## THE LAY OF HLOTH AND ANGANTÝR <span class="small">OR</span> THE BATTLE OF THE HUNS

T<span class="small">HIS</span> dialogic lay about the hostile half
brothers may justly claim high rank among the small number of genuine
“heroic” poems. In grandeur of theme, in extraordinary vigor and
splendor of style, in heroic passion, it challenges comparison with such
poems as *Atlakvitha* and *Hamthismól;* which it resembles also in its
air of antiquity, in the epic-dramatic form, in the rugged mixture of
*fornyrthtslag* and *málaháttr* and, alas! also in the sadly mutilated
condition of the text. Fully one-third of the original poem seems lost,
and a number of stanzas are no doubt corrupted. The total impression is
much weakened by the connecting prose, which, in this case, to a large
extent represents imperfectly remembered stanzas, with still an
occasional rhythm, here and there an alliteration, or a striking phrase
suggesting the noble original verse.

 There are good reasons for thinking the lay a quasi-historical
reminiscence from the time of Gothic greatness, transmitted possibly
through some South Germanic song—partial reflection of the tremendous
events of the migration period, perhaps the clash of Goth and Hun on the
Catalaunian Fields (451), or some other vast battle of nations
unrecorded in histories. The conflict is here located on the Dun-heath,
whether that locality be the plains of the Danube or those of the Lugii
Duni about the upper Oder. In the latter case, it is interesting to
note, the Jassar Fells (stanza 27) would correspond to the Jesenik
(German, Gesenke), the stretch of hill country which forms the broad
gate between the high and impassable Sudeti and the Carpathian ranges.
This, again, would permit the inference that the Goths were at that time
still in their North European homes by the Vistula<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) and the Baltic which, as we know from
other sources, they right at <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> the end of
the second century <span class="small">A.D.</span> Ultimate derivation
from a Gothic lay of these remote times is no more impossible than in
the case of *Hamthismól,* the great figures of Ermanaric and Theodoric,
and their relations with Attila forming the very basic layer of Germanic
folk hero lore. At any rate there are a number of clear indications that
the lay has as its background the vast plains and broad rivers of the
east central portions of Europe. Geographic exactness is not to be
expected at that distance of time. A clear argument for the very early
spread of the story may be seen in the fact that no less than five
persons connected with it occur in lines 116-119 of the Anglo-Saxon
catalogue poem of *Wīdsīth* from the seventh century—a poem which also
otherwise betrays considerable knowledge of very early Continental
conditions.

 No doubt the episode here celebrated is the original kernel of the
composite *Hervarar saga* in which it is preserved. For the lay after
stanza 11 (of this translation) we are dependent on seventeenth-century
MSS of the saga.

 On one of his expeditions the evil but wise son of Hervor, King
Heithrek, abducts the daughter of the powerful Humli,<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) King of the Huns. She gives birth to
Hloth, who is brought up by his maternal grandfather, since Heithrek put
his mother away in favor of another queen whose children by him are
Angantýr and Hervor—a quasi reincarnation of her amazon grandmother.
When Heithrek dies Angantýr succeeds him; but his half brother claims an
equal share of the inheritance.

 Now<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13.md) Hloth learned about the death
of his father, and that his brother, Angantýr, had himself made king
over all those lands which Heithrek had owned. Then King Humli advised
Hloth to claim from Angantýr his share of the inheritance with fair
words; as is said here:

 That winter, King Humli and Hloth stayed at home; but when spring came
they drew together so great a host that there <span id="page_42">p.
42</span> was a dearth of fighting men in Hunland. . . . And when this
mighty host was gathered they rode through Murkwood. . . . As they came
out of the forest they found many farms and level fields. In the fields
there stood a fair castle. There ruled Hervor, Angantýr’s and Hloth’s
sister, and with her, Ormar, her foster father. They warded the land
against the Huns and had a great host. . . . One morning, about sunrise,
Hervor stood on a tower above the castle gate. She saw so much dust
southward toward the forest that it hid the sun for a long time. Then
saw she a glow under the dust, as though from gold, of fair shields
inlaid with gold, of gilded helmets and bright byrnies. Then understood
she that this was the Hunnish host, and most numerous. She hurried down
and called her trumpeter and bade him summon the host. Then said Hervor
to them: “Take your weapons and make ready for battle; but thou, Ormar,
ride out toward the Huns and affer them battle before the southern
gate.”<span id="fr_30"></span>[30](#note_30.md)

 (And so he did and) then returned to the castle. Then was Hervor armed
and all her host. . . . There was a great battle; but because the Huns
had a much greater host, the battle turned against Hervor, and at length
she fell, and round about her, many men. But when Ormar saw her fall he
fled, and with him all they who still lived. He rode day and night as
fast as he could, to King Angantýr in Árheimar, while the Huns took to
harrying and burning the countryside. When he arrived he said:

made good, in the case of the Goths, by continual reinforcements; so
that at last the Huns were forced to give ground. Angantýr stepped into
the front ranks with the sword Tyrfing in hand, and slew both Hloth and
Humli. Then the Huns took to flight, and the Goths slew so many that the
rivers were dammed up and overflowed their banks and the valleys were
filled with dead men and horses. Angantýr went about on the battlefield
to search among the fallen. He found his brother Hloth. Then he said:

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) This stanza is held by some not to
belong to the lay.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) Pronounce Gitsur. Cf. the Prose
after 14.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) Old Norse *Gautar,* the inhabitants
of the present Swedish provinces of East and West Gotland. Not to be
confused with the Goths (Old Norse *Gotar*)—a name frequently used in a
general and honorific, but here in a special, sense. The seats, at
different times, of that noble and gifted race ranged from the Baltic to
the Black Sea and thence to Spain.

<span id="footnotes_page_38">p. 38</span>

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) Used, vaguely, of various west and
south European nations.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) This name is by some scholars held
to be derived from Cæsar, in view especially of *Wīdsīth,* lines
76-78—*mid Cāsere, sē the wimburga geweald āhte, Wiolena and Wilna and
Wala rīces*.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) No such English king is known in
legend or history. The name seems identical with that of Abbot Ælfric,
the famous writer of the latter part of the tenth century; but
unconsciously one thinks of Alfred the Great (849-901).

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md) The hostile brothers no doubt
correspond to the *Hlithe* and *Incgenthēow* of *Wīdsīth* (116). *Leth*
was the third king of the Langobardians.

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md) Thus Helgi “stands in arms” in
earliest infancy; cf. the *First Lay of Helgi*. The prose preceding
rationalizes this heroic trait as follows: “It was said, in former
times, that a man was born ‘with weapons and horses,’ for the reason
that the weapons lay ready when he was born—also livestock, such as oxen
and horses, if they happened to be born then. All these were given at
birth to men of rank, to honor them.”

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md) *I.e.,* helmets adorned with
strips of plaited rings, as were used in the Viking period.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md) *I.e.,* within the confines of
royal residence and temple.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md) This prose link may possibly
paraphrase the contents of a lost stanza or stanzas. Still, bearing in
mind the abrupt transitions in ballad technique, we need not conclude
this.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14.md) *I.e.,* “River-Dwelling”; by some
supposed to be by the Dniepr River, about which lay the lands of the
Goths in the fourth century.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15.md) Very evidently, it is Hloth who
comes from afar; but the text is ambiguous. To judge from similar
passages in other poems, a half-stanza containing a question <span
id="footnotes_page_39">p. 39</span> of the warrior on guard, and one
containing the beginning of Hloth’s speech, are missing.

<span id="footnotes_page_39">p. 39</span>

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16.md) The gap supplied after the
suggestion of Heusler-Ranisch.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17.md) This stanza and the following
half-stanza are found only in one seventeenth century MS. However, it
expresses the substance rather better than the Prose.

<span id="footnotes_page_40">p. 40</span>

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18.md) Thus the text. Possibly, the awl
is taken as representative of peaceful pursuits. “Edge,” *pars pro toto*
for “sword.”

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19.md) This great forest is mentioned
also in the *Lay of Atli,* 8, and in the *Plaint of Oddrún,* 23, as
separating the land of the Niflungs from that of the Huns.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20.md) Bugge (*Norrœne Skrifter,* etc.,
362) suggests that the “hallowed grave” refers to a burial place where
the departed Gothic kings were interred; and the “shining stone,” to a
boulder in the high place of assembly of the Goths on which the newly
chosen kings were acclaimed by the people.

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21.md) *I.e.,* “Stead by the Dniepr”
(Latin Danaper), probably. It is mentioned also in *Rígsthula*, 49.

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22.md) *I.e.,* his daughter’s son.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23.md) Cf. the penalty paid by the gods
for killing Otter, *Reginsmól,* 5.

<span id="footnotes_page_41">p. 41</span>

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24.md) Which is the usual share,
according to Old Germanic law, of the son born out of wedlock.

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25.md) Here equivalent to
“armor-bearer”—as is, e.g., Hildebrand to Dietrich. The Grytings are
probably identical with the Ostrogoths, by the Latin and Greek authors
called *Greothingi,* *Grouthingoi* (Bugge, *op. cit.,* p. 273). As the
wicked adviser and instigator of strife, he may represent Óthin. His
name may be a reminiscence of the East Germanic name Geiseric
(Gizericus).

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26.md) He sarcastically implies that
Hloth would acknowledge himself to be a bastard, entitled to
compensation—and no more—if he accepted anything but half of his
inheritance. Hloth is likened to a shepherd on a hill, tending his
flocks, when the kingdom was divided.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27.md) The wordy prose link of the
original no doubt represents one or more stanzas now lost.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28.md) The half-line is uncertain.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29.md) *I.e.,* down to the last
available resources in men and supplies.

<span id="footnotes_page_42">p. 42</span>

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30.md) This passage must represent a
series of stanzas; the last one evidently in direct speech, to which the
following stanza is the answer.

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31.md) The *Wyrmhere* of *Wīdsīth,* 119.

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32.md) The missing half-stanza is
supplied following the suggestions of Bugge and Heusler-Ranisch.

<span id="footnotes_page_43">p. 43</span>

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33.md) Freely supplied by the translator
after the suggestion of the prose.

<span id="footnotes_page_44">p. 44</span>

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34.md) The last sentence of the prose no
doubt paraphrases the lost portion of this stanza.

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35.md) “Battle.” Name of a traditional
field of battle?

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36.md) Supplied for this corrupt half
line.

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37.md) Supplied freely by the translator
for a hopelessly corrupt line.

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38.md) Thus dedicating them to Óthin;
cf. *Voluspó,* 16.

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39.md) Supplied by all editors.

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40.md) Both half-stanzas tentatively
restored by the translator from the prose.

<span id="footnotes_page_45">p. 45</span>

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41.md) Conjectural.

<span id="note_42"></span>[42](#fr_42.md) ”Hundreds” and “thousands” are
here used as designations for smaller tactical units.
