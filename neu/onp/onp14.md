## THE SONG OF THE VALKYRIES <span class="small">\[DARRA THARLIOTH\]</span>

“O<span class="small">N</span> Good Friday it happened in Caithness<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) that a man called Dorroth went out of
doors. He saw twelve persons ride toward a (stone) hut. There they were
lost to his sight. When he came up to the hut and looked through a chink
in the wall he saw that some women were inside and had set up a web.
Heads of men served as weights, men’s entrails formed the woof and weft,
a sword did as a weaver’s reed, and arrows as the rods. They sang this
song: (follows the *Song of the Valkyries*). Then they tore the web down
and into pieces, and each one held on to what she had in her hands.
Dorroth right the opening and went home; but the women mounted their
horses and rode away—six to the south and six to the north.”

 Thus the *Niáls saga* (Chapter 157), whose narrative is our sole source
for one of the most striking poems of Norse antiquity. Down to Walter
Scott’s days it was recited in the Norn tongue by the inhabitants of
North Ronaldsha (*Rinansey*), the northernmost of the Orkney
Islands.<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md)

 As we have it, the lay is darkly prophetic of the outcome of the great
battle of Clontarf (1014) in which some of the actors in the saga took
part on the side of the Viking leaders, Sigtrygg Silkbeard, King of
Dublin, and the Orkney earl, Sigurth Hlothversson, who were arrayed
against the famous King Brian Borumha of Leinster; but contrary to its
prophecy, history—and the saga, too—tells us that it was the Leinster
king who won <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> the victory, though he paid
for it with his life, and that the invaders were driven off, leaving
Earl Sigurth on the field. To account for this contradiction, some
scholars have surmised that the lay originally referred to some other
battle. Against this it may be urged that at any rate Sigurth’s fall is
foretold, in stanza 7. Also, it is just possible that the Irish
themselves are meant as the dwellers on the outer nesses in their own
land (*ibid*.) and that the valkyries are chanting their magic song to
safeguard only their favorite, the young King Sigtrygg, weaving for him
the “web of war”—much as the giant maidens in the *Quern Song* “grind
out” the fate of their captor, King Fróthi.

 As to the supposed transmitter of the lay, Dorroth, it seems that his
name was supplied, either from the kenning in stanza 4, the
“web-of-darts,” *i.e.,* “battle” (*vefr darratha(r)*) or, even more
probably, from the (unauthentic and inappropriate) current title of the
lay, *Darratha(r)lióth* or *Lay of the Darts* which was misunderstood as
*Dorroth’s Lay*.

 Few lays in Old Norse compare with the *Song of the Valkyries* in
somber power and dark magnificence. Thoroughly in harmony with the great
carnage presaged is the gruesome picture of the loom; and terribly
splendid the vision of the red dawn with its cloud-rack incarnadined by
the blood of warriors, into which the battle maidens issue forth, riding
on wild horses to join the fray.

 The lay—which is in regular *fornyrthislag*—is handed down in the four
main MSS of the *Niáls saga,* dating from the fourteenth to the
seventeenth century, but seems incomplete, for all that, and is in poor
shape.<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md) In this case it is not
altogether unlikely that the author was an inhabitant of the Northern
Isles. At any rate it is well to remember that still another poetic
prophecy—a genre more Celtic than Germanic in inspiration—viz., the
*Quern Song,* right memories in these localities where Norse and Celtic
blended most intimately.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_72">p. 72</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md) The northeasternmost district of
Scotland.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md) The poem had struck the imagination
of Thomas Gray, who in 1768 made a free version of it which he entitled
*The Fatal Sisters*. In 1814, when Scott was on his voyage among the
northern islands of Great Britain, he heard a gentleman tell that when
some remnants of the Norse were yet spoken there, a clergyman had
carried thither Gray’s version, then newly published, and had read it to
some old people as referring to the ancient history of the islands. But
as soon as he had proceeded a little way they exclaimed they knew it
well in the original and had often sung it. They called it “The
Enchantress” (Lockhart, *Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott,* IV,
81. See also *The Pirate,* Note c).

<span id="footnotes_page_73">p. 73</span>

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) In order not to overload the
footnotes I have tacitly essayed an approximation in the translation of
the first and second stanzas as well as in numerous other doubtful
passages.

<span id="footnotes_page_74">p. 74</span>

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) Kenning for “battle.” The same
conception, growing out of the interweaving of darts and arrows in the
air, is found in the Anglo-Saxon *wīgspēda gewiofu,* “the web of
battle-luck” (*Bēowulf* 697). The two parts of this difficult stanza are
parallel: a web is set up, the “web-of-battle,” which is all stained
with blood.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) Another kenning for “battle.” (Thing
= “meeting.”)

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) The whole line, probably, a kenning
for “blood.” Randvér’s banesman was Bikki, the evil counselor of
Iormunrekk (cf. *Guthrúnarhvot,* Prose, and note 8), in whom—as in Gizur
(*Battle of the Huns*)—we may detect Óthin, the instigator of strife
between men. “Fill” is here, probably, used in the sense of completing
the web with woof and weft. But it might also mean “to saturate” and so,
“to color.”

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) The batten is the instrument used to
beat home the yarn. Much also in this stanza is doubtful.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) The names of valkyries.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md) Kenning for “battle-axe.”

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md) Granting that “the web-of-darts”
is a kenning for “battle” (from the cloud, or web, of missiles flying
overhead), the meaning of this uncertain line is that the <span
id="footnotes_page_75">p. 75</span> valkyries are urging each other on
to “weave” another such victorious battle as the young king (Sigtrygg)
had before. Cf. Eiríkr Magnússon, *Old-lore Miscellany of Orkney* III,
92.

<span id="footnotes_page_75">p. 75</span>

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md) It is for the valkyries to decide
the fate of battle and to choose the slain: they have no need of his
life.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md) *I.e.,* King Brian, who was set
upon at the very end of the battle. The earl, Sigurth Hlothversson, had
fallen earlier.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md) A hint to the listener outside.
