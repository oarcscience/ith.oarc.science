### TROYÁN.

The meaning of this word has always been in dispute and must remain a
matter of sheer conjecture.

There are four references in the text.

I. l. 59. 'Oh Boyán, hadst but thou sung of these hosts. . . weaving
together from both ends of this epoch, racing down the path of Troyán!'

II\. l. 209. 'There have been the ages \[or, reading on the authority of
Karamzín, сѣчи, the affrays\] of Troyán, the years of Yarosláv have
passed by, there have been the regiments of Olég.'

III\. l. 288. Contumely arose in the forces of Dažbog's descendant \[?
Russia, the civilizing power; compare a curious passage in Ипат. 1114
where a myth is told at length of a king of Egypt, Dažbog, who civilized
men and was succeeded by the Sun\], stepped like a maiden in the Land of
Troyán. . .'

IV\. l. 569. 'In the seventh age of Troyán, Vséslav cast his lot for a
maiden dear to him.' <span id="fr_16"></span>[†](#fn_16.md)

In this last passage E. reads Зояни. If my view holds good that Troyán
is derived from три three, this would be a natural eror; in the original
MS. all numbers were designated by Cyrillic letters; and were copied by
Musin-Puškin as Arabic numerals: hence the original may have had Fояни,
which was copied out as Зояни by the clerk and then taken for Зояни.

If, again, on reading these passages, it appears that by substituting
'Russia' for 'Troyán,' a simple and satisfactory sense is obtained, the
last passage is an amplification of the first, and it will be found
there are exactly seven generations between Vséslav and Rurik, the
founder of the dynasty.

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

it is evident that the phrase is highly poetical, and that it is
associated with Boyán, the range of whose verse is set out in the very
corrupt passage at the end, Рекъ Боянъ и хокды. . . l. 745 \[v. the note
on this passage\].

There have been very many speculations.

1\. (1) Geographical. That the land and path of Troyán refer to some
country either East or West of medieval Russia, anyhow in Polovsk
territory. There is a town called Troitsk in Orenbúrg on the river Уй
and Увелка; a place Троянъ in Bulgaria in the Lobeč district on the
river Osma whence roads lead to Loveč, Teteren and Selvi.

Sederholm states that the country between the Pruth and the Ister was
called Provincia Traiani in the Geographia Antiqua of Cellarius. In the
historical map for the year 895 there is a spot in the Danube near Lat.
44° Long. 40°, marked Pons Traiani.--This is the district identified
with the "Trojan" country by other theorists.

To these facts may be added a town Troyán in Smolénsk, south of Krásny,
and Troyánovka in Poltáva \[Dubenski\], and Troílov on the River Don
near the Kagalnik or Kayála.

No doubt other names can be traced.

\(2\) Weltmann altogether rejects Троянъ and substitutes Краянъ the
border land, This is very violent and does not explain all the passages.

II\. That the word stands for Trajan, the Roman Emperor. This theory is
not altogether fantastic; for Trajan built a road and a wall in Dacia;
the road running from Várhély along the river Strey (which falls into
the Máros) thence to Karlsburg and so North to Torda (Salinum) where it
divided one branch leading to Kolosvár and the other North East.

There is some evidence that the name of Trajan survived in legend.
Sederholm quotes a topical былина of the reign of Catherine II
commemorating a Turkish war.

На разсвѣтѣ было бъ середу,  
На дорогѣ на Траяновой,  
Подашли мы близко къ лагерю.

On this theory Boyán's mind soared back very far to the oldest,
prehistoric battle-fields of the Slavs.

In South Russia there is a long wall балъ трояновъ connected with
traditions of Троянъ Царь Ермаланекій \[римлянскій\] and coins of Trajan
have been found by his walls on the Danube.

Lastly, as evidence of the permanence of Trajan's name, a miracle, of
Clement, Pope of Rome, commences thus.

Къ попу Клименту отъ Рима озимьстровану въ Херсонъ Траияну Царемь.
\[Изв. отд. рус. я. и словес.--VI Спб. 1903\].

III\. The possibilities of this flexible root are still unexhausted.

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

The word has been taken, mainly by Petrûševič and Vyázemski, to mean
Trojan, to be the Russian tradition of Homer; and in this connection the
Maiden is construed as the evil star of Helen, as the blood-thirsty
Artemis of Tauris, whose rites were recorded both by Euripides and by
Strabo. \[V. note незнаемѣ\]. This school tries to prove a Russian
tradition, similar to that which obtained in England, France and
Germany, of tracing ancestries back to Hector of Troy. It is argued that
the lower Danube country was called Dardania in Strabo's time. This land
would have served as a mart for interchange of the thoughts of the East
and the West. But granting these facts--and very much of the vast
erudition brought to bear on them is quite irrelevant to Russia--it is
difficult to see how the land-locked state of medieval Russia could have
imported very much of this lore.

The incessant warfare internal and external, the barring of the road to
Constantinople by the Pólovtsy and Bolgars, and the hostility of the
Catholic powers to the North West, have made Russian medieval
productions peculiarly native; and it is difficult to discern any
connection with ancient Greece, even in its medieval garb.

Rambaud (*La Russie Epique*) whose authorities are Vyázemski, Kirěyevski
and others, also supports the theory of classical origin.

IV\. Troyán has also been taken to be a Pagan god of Slavdom. For this
theory there is fairly strong external evidence. Míkloziš cites from
Vostókov of the ancient Slavs;--"believing in many gods, in Perun, and
Khors, Div and Troyán, who were men of past days; Perun amongst the
Greeks, Khors in Cyprus, Troyán an emperor at Rome. . .'

It has been supposed that Troyán was the God of the dead, but I cannot
find any proof.

In 'The Virgin's Descent into Hell' \[Leo Wiener's translation\]. 'These
are they who did not believe in the Father. . . . They changed Troyán,
Khors, Veles, Perún to gods. . . .'

As a supernatural being, Troyán is found in several Serbian legends.
Busláyev \[Москвитянинъ 1842 No. 11\] quotes Karadžić and says; there
was once a city of Troyán on Mount Tsera near Dvorišša where Tsar Troyán
lived. Every night he drove to Srěm \[Sirmia\], to see a maiden he
loved. He went by night because he feared the day as it might heat him.
When he arrived at Srěm, he gave his horses oats and at cock's crow \[до
Куръ v. l. 595\] returned. But one day the husband of the maiden put
sand into the manger instead of oats and slit all the cocks' tongues.
The Tsar was kept waiting and stayed too long. The sun had already
risen. He fled and hid behind a hayrick, but the cows came along and
tore it down and so the Tsar melted.'

Further \[Древности 1865 Moscow Vol. I Матеріалы\] in the Слово и
Откровеніе Св. Апостоловъ, XVI. Troyán is recorded amongst the Pagan
Gods, the passage, apparently being the one first quoted.

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

In Serbian and Bulgarian traditions of Troyán or Troím \[Vuk Stepanović
1852 2nd edition\] Troyán appears as a nocturnal being who fears
daylight, may have three heads \[? false etymology from три\] and wings
which melted in the sun; and in further development as a Midas with
goat's ears. There are Bulgarian songs of a town Troyán the inhabitants
of which believed in gold and silver.

It therefore appears that the Southern Slavs had legends of a nocturnal
gnome who bore this name. To attach this tale to Vséslav and to
translate до Куръ by cock's crow would be ridiculous and out of style
with the poem.

V. It remains to sum up and, if possible, extract something coherent
from this nebulous being.

I take it that Troyán is a name for Russia, derived from the significant
number three, and that it was thus written in the lost MS. There were
the three Scandinavian brothers who arrived at Kíev \[v. Nestor 6370\],
Rurik, Sineus and Truvor. As the hills of Kíev came into sight they
asked: "whose is this town?"The reply was;--"There were three brothers
Kiĭ, Šček and Khoriv \[i.e. the ancestors of Kíev, Čechs and Croatians\]
who built this little town, and they perished and we sit here paying
tribute to the Khozars."

--It was always the same tradition of the subject Slavs.--Druhenski
states that all the Slavs use the word Троянъ as a nickname; that it
means the third, and generally the third son.--He proceeds to support
his argument for шестикрыльци and осмомысле as a play on numbers; \[v.
notes on these words\].

Thus the land of Rurik, of the third brother, may have been a poetical
name; the exactness of the Seven Generations (l. 568) seems to me
conclusive proof.

The word next acquired alien import; the traditions of Trajan who was
worshipped in his lifetime, and who, after his death, was long
remembered for his great road and wall, tendered this title of Russia
more imperial and more dignified.

There also existed a belief in a subterranean God Troyán, a gnome ar
sprite, condemned with the Rusálki (the mermaids) by the ecclesiasts,
ever on their watch against the ineradicable lingerings of the old
superstitions. The fact that this Troyán could be imagined to have three
beads incidentally serves to justify the etymology from три. Probably
this Serbian being did not influence the poet of the Slóvo.

The poet of the Slôvo (l. 30) takes up the poetical narrative where
Boyán ceased; his scope of narration had been from Ígoŕ the son of Rurik
and Svyatoshiv I to the "ancient time" \[цтарое бремя\], i.e., (as
Sederholm remarks Vladímir I) \[v. l. 745\]
