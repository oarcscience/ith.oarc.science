</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">&sect;8. YAROSL&Aacute;V I.</h3>  
<p>Vlad&iacute;mir I left twelve sons surviving. The immediate business was to thin their ranks.</p>  
<p>Svyatop&oacute;lk o&iacute; Turov (a town on the Pripet&#8217; about 150 miles from K&iacute;ev) at once proclaimed himself grand prince and despatched his brothers Bor&iacute;s of Rost&oacute;v and Gl&#283;b of M&uacute;rom and Svyatosl&aacute;v, prince among the Drevly&aacute;ne.</p>  
<p>Svyatop&oacute;lk bears a very bad name in the annals of Russia, for bloodthirstiness and tyranny. In the Zad&oacute;n&#353;&#269;ina (the Moscovite plagiarism on the Sl&oacute;vo) he is constantly mentioned as the prototype of an evil prince.</p>  
<p>Svyatop&oacute;lk was married to a Polish princess and had already revolted against his father. Yarosl&aacute;v with the Norsemen of N&oacute;vgorod marched to K&iacute;ev and expelled Svyatop&oacute;lk, who recovered K&iacute;ev soon after with the aid of Polish troops. This foreign occupation rendered him even more detested, and soon after their departure, he was beaten by Yarosl&aacute;v in 1019 and died on his way to Poland.</p>  
<p>The reign of Yarosl&aacute;v the Wise [&#1052;&#1091;&#1076;&#1088;&#1099;&#1081;] lasted until 1054; up to 1036 Mst&iacute;slav of Tmutarak&aacute;&#324; obliged him to adhere to a partition of Russia; from 1036-1054 Russia was for the last time a unitary state.</p>  
<p>Yarosl&aacute;v's enduring reputation rests on his fortification of the boundaries by building cities and on his codification of Russian law [&#1056;&#1091;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1103; &#1055;&#1088;&#1072;&#1074;&#1076;&#1072;], the erection of cathedrals (e.g. Saint Sophia at N&oacute;vgorod); generally speaking on his work as a consolidator.</p>  
<p>In 1020 he defeated Svyatop&oacute;lk with great carnage on the Alta [or &#1051;&#1100;&#1090;&#1072;]; an event worth marking as the first time when a Russian prince appeared in the field leading the Pe&#269;enegs, nomad enemies against the Prince of K&iacute;ev. Polotsk became the permanent possession or the house of Izyasl&aacute;v; this marked the first definitive scission.</p>  
<p>In 1022 Mst&iacute;slav of Tmutarak&aacute;&#324; defeated the Kasog chieftain Red&eacute;lya in single combat, (a heroic episode for which see line 19 of the text, and the note on it).</p>  
<p>Yarosl&aacute;v tried to provide against the anarchy of the partitions by decreeing in his will the division stated in the previous section. It was a vain attempt.</p>  
<p>His death marks the passing of Russia's unity. In that same year, too, a more formidable foe began to assail the borders of Russia; the P&oacute;lovtsy under their leader Bolus or Blus. The Pe&#269;enegs were now conquered, but by a more energetic Turanian race that harassed Russia, until the Mongols in 1224 subdued them and the Russians alike.</p>
