### II. (1) THE GEOGRAPHY OF RUSSIA.

It would he useful to set out *seriatim* a few elementary geographical
facts before attempting to enter on an abstract of Russian history to
illustrate the references in the Slóvo.

Russia in Europe now comprises 1,997,000 square miles, a territory just
less than seventeen times that of the United Kingdom. But medieval
Russia, i.e. the country effectively occopied and nationalized, roughly
comprized only the present Governments of Volhynia, Kíev, Černígov,
Smolénsk, with outposts in Minsk and Vitebsk; farther North, Nóvgorod
had established a free domain, which had little or no share in the
current of Russian history, until it was merged in the Moscovite Empire
by Iván III in the year 1478. Moscow and Northern Russia were only
gradually colonized from the South in the course of the XII and XIII
centuries.

On a rough calculation this essential Russia occupied no less an area
than 90257 square miles, an expanse of not very much smaller than that
of the entirety of the British islands.

Russia is a country of great waterways,:none of which empty into any of
the great seas. The Dnĕstr flows through Poland and Galicia into the
Black Sea at Odessa, the Dnĕpr, with its numerous affluents flows
through central Russia, and reaches the same land-locked sea at 
Kherson; the Don and the Volga are still farther East, and the latter
finds its outlet in that huge salt-water lake, the Caspian.

Medieval Russia only benefited by the Dněpr, which formed the great
commercial road between the Baltic and the Black Sea.

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

But the homeland of Russian civilization suffered under great
disadvantages. The immense flat stretch of North-Eastern Europe has no
great mountains nor any natural frontiers, and medieval Russia in
particular was an undefined land, open to aggression from all sides,

On the South she was cut off from the Black Sea and the estuary of the
Dněpr at Čerkásy, <span id="fr_1"></span>[†](#fn_1.md) one hundred miles
south of Pereyáslavl’.

From Čerkásy the Russian frontier ran more or less parallel with the
coast of the Black Sea, and the land to the South was occupied by
hostile nomads, To the East the rivers Sulá and Seĭm formed another
shifting boundary; and the Turanian tribes held undisputed, sway up to
the farthest North, to the shores of the White Sea.

On the West, there was an uncertain line of demarcation in what is now
Austrian Galicia and Eastern Poland, a region always contested for by
the Roman Catholic Poles against the Orthodox Russians.

On the North, the Lithuanians and Esths, and other savage races, which
had not yet attained to civic life, barred the way to the Baltic; when
they were conquered, it was by the German knights of Brandenburg.

Thus the Russians, in addition to being an inland state, had none of the
security of a frontier formed by mountain-ranges (such as the
Carpathians, which sheltered the Hungarians, nor that of one formed by
one of the great rivers.

This indefensible position was held by the Russians of Kíev, who bore
all the brunt of the Turanian assaults in the confused migrations of the
ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries. Their realm, minute as it is in
comparison with modern Russia, was a vast field to defend. These
geographical factors are of the utmost importance, if the division and
anarchy of Russian history is to be understood, and, to a certain
extent, condoned. Thus, taking distances as the crow flies, from
Nóvgorod to Pskov is two hundred miles, from Pskov to Polotsk, (the fief
of the Kriviči and an independent branch of the reigning family)--300
miles, from Černígov to Minsk 325, from Černígov to Kíev (the two
capitals of medieval Russia) one hundred miles, from Kíev to
Pereyáslavl’ 75, from the junction of the rivers Donéts and Don to Kíev
500, and from Vladímir Suzdalski, (the first capital of the Northern
branch of the family who were to gain sovereignty over all Russia) 600
miles.

This tedious list of figures might be prolonged: but they must be
emphasized: otherwise the abuses of the medieval Russian polity will
remain inexplicable on any theory of human folly. These great flaws,
were the incessant subdivision of territory amongst the sons of the
reigning house; the retention of lateral descendibility instead of
lineal \[отчины, дѣдины\], with all of its attendant risks civil war,
disputed rights and the temptaion to establish independent domains: it
was because the rights of minors could not be effectually guarded,
because children could not

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

undertake the heavy military duties that so very swiftly wore out the
warlike generations of the Russians.

One or two really great rulers succeeded in the frightful task of
establishing central authority and maintaining these vague and shifting
boundaries.

The Russians themselves at this time called themselves collectively
Руць. It was a word with an import like that of Ἑλλάς of old; an
honorific, rather than a territorial designation; wherever the Russian
went was Руць; he built cities, established the Christian worship; and,
segregated from contact with the West by his position and parted from
the decaying Eastern Empire, (to which he owed his civilization) by
barbarian marauders who beset the lines of communication by land,
(whilst he had no access by sea), he upheld his culture and spread it
abroad, colonized and permeated the Finnish territories to the North and
the Turanian to the South, and everywhere carried his country with hire.

That he had great lacks and faults, is very evident, The Russian had no
genius for organization; stupendous as the work was, the later princes
showed no power of adaptation. Their separatist tendencies betrayed them
into every dishonourable course, alliance with the savage tent-dwellers
who were shaking the foundations of their state, treachery amongst
themselves, unwillingness to co-operate. All through Russian history
down to the final defeat by the Tatars in the year 1224, it was only the
house that happened to hold the throne at Kíev that fought against the
myriad foes from beyond the steppes; and, when the Tatars were
established for their two hundred years of rule, subjugation brought the
most disgusting servility and meanness in its train.

The Slóvo was written only some fifty years before the great disaster of
1224; it is literally and narrowly historical; and it portrays the
merits of the Russians, to whom it fell to beat off the Asiatic invaders
of Europe, their high ideal, as well as their lapses from it.

This history must now be reviewed in brief outline.
