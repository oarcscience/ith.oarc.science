### §6. VLADÍMIR I.

Vladímir was the first prince of Russia, by birth partly of Slav blood.
He owed his accesssion to the throne at Kíev to Norsemen; possibly it
was facilitated by the distrust aroused by his brother Yaropólk's
leanings towards Christianity. At any rate Vladímir, who was to be
sainted as the Constantine of Russia, commenced his reign by
re-instating Paganism with all the zeal of the proselytizer. He set up
idols on a hill in Kíev, facing the Palace, to Perun the god of thunder,
to Khors the Sungod, to Dažbog the god of the sky, to Stríbog, the god
of the winds, Sěmorgl and Mokoš; and he offered human sacrifice. It may
he remarked that of these deities next to nothing is known save their
names as recited in this list; that it is improbable that the Slavs, who
were nature-worshippers, had ever set up statues to their gods; and,
lastly, that human immolations had never taken place in Russia,--unless
the account in Euripides of the Tauric Artemis can be cited in this
connection.

Whether this sudden State establishment of heathendom would have
accomplished its end may be doubted; for Russia was by now permeated
with Christian doctrine. But the last flicker of Pagandom in Russia was
very vigorous, for it was the act of a strong and self-willed ruler.

This happened in the year 980. Eight years elapsed, and the politic
ruler found occasion to reverse the direction of this religious zeal. He
had been to Constantinople, and wished to ally himself to the Empire by
marrying Anna, the Emperor's sister. Also, his Varangians from
Scandinavia, through whom he had gained single sovereignty, were
becoming oppressive to their master; and Vladímir was glad to dismiss
them to the service of his Byzantine ally, recommending him to relegate
these unruly champions to the provinces, and safeguard himself against
their superfluous energies. This act marks the end of Scandinavian
government in Russia.

As early as the year 866 a bishop had been appointed for Kíev and a
church built for him; before that date, Saints Cyril and Method, the
apostles of Russia, had worked amongst the Western Slavs and in the
Tauric Chersonnese, for the purpose of evangelization inventing the
Cyrillic alphabet (as Ulfilas had done for the Goths): further, the
conversion of Olga in 945 must have been propagative.

The price of Anna was the baptism of her intended husband; the political
advantage of favouring the powerful Pagan party at Kíev had now ceased.

In 988 Vladímir ordered the conversion of Russia, cast his idols down
with a contumely only comparable to their peremptory erection; thus, he
tied Perun to the tail of a horse, had him flagellated and drowned in
the Dněpr, seeing that he was safely carried beyond the rapids on that
stream. The Chronicles add a pleasing legend that Vladímir assembled a
council of Boyárs, and examined into the desirabilities of the
German--i.e. the Roman--, the Jewish--i.e. the practices of the
Khozars,--and the Greek profession. Only in the Greek faith was the
supreme beauty to be found.

The citizens were baptized in droves on pain of the royal displeasure.
Vladímir acquired Kórsun, the capital of the Chersonesse (or Crimea)
which he had been besieging and also, as security for this important
conquest, (by means of which he could protect his Black Sea commerce)
the hand of the Greek princess.

Henceforth Russia was Holy Russia; her Christianity conferred on her
perennial struggle against the Pagan nomads the fervour of a crusade. In
her isolation the new faith lent her strength, endurance and purpose.

The baptism of Russia and the expulsion of the Varangians are the two
epoch-making events of Vladímir's reign.

In the year 993 Vladímir was engaged in a frontier foray against the
Croatians, and on his return had to encounter the Pečenegs not far from
the river Sulá; he defeated them at Trubež near Pereyáslavl’. This
battle was decided, according to the Chronicle, by single combat between
a Pečeneg Goliath and a Russian David. The Polovsk peril was very
imminent, for Vladímir thought fit to construct a network of fortresses
on the Dněpr and its affluents.

Vladímir, in the popular ballads of Russia, became the Charlemagne at
whose court the heroes met and the Tatar Pagan foes were invariably
overcome.

Amongst his military feats may be mentioned the reunion of Polotsk with
Russia, which had become independent under one Rógvolod; and his war
with Poland, as a result of which he retained Galicia for Russia.

After his conversion he founded many churches and an ecclesiastical
college at Kíev and showed great piety, which combined with uxoriousness
on a very lavish scale,

The North of Russia he had little leisure to watch; and Paganism
maintained itself much longer there, corresponding with the political
severance which distance made unavoidable and time was to confirm.

He died in the year 1015, leaving eleven sons, by various connections;
the twelfth, Svyatopolk I was his brother Yaropólk's son; Vladímir
married Yaropóik's widow.

He partitioned out principalities to his sons; these grants were called
удѣлы, (uděly).
