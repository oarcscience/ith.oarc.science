### § 13. THE FALL OF KIEV AND RISE OF SUZDAL AND MOSCOW.

The confused history of this epoch is clearest surveyed from its centre,
which had moved up North.

South Russia was exhausting itself. From the year 1054 the Pólovtsy had
been ravaging and laying waste, carrying off with them Russians as
slaves and creating utter insecurity, poignantly described in the
Chronicles for 1170. "God put a good thought into the heart of Mstíslav
Izyaslávič on behalf of the Russian land; for he wished her well with
all his heart; so he summoned his brothers, and took counsel with them,
saying;--'Brothers, have compassion on the Russian land, and for your
own ancestral estates; for the enemy every year carry away the peasants
\[or the Christians\] in their tents; they cut down our forests, and
always march over us; and already they will soon cut us off from the
road to Greece to Salonica. . . .'"; or again (1103) "In the spring the
serf \[смердъ\] sets out to plough with his horses, and the Polovčín
arrives, strikes him down with his arrow, takes his horse, then goes
into his village, seizes his wife, his children and all of his
possessions, and burns the empty hut."

After 1126 the evil went on unabated. Some of the Polovsk campaigns
should be outlined. In 1128 they were active under a leader Seluk, a
very Turkish name. In 1135, 1139, the Ólgoviči are in alliance with the

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

Pólovtsy. In 1140 the Pólovtsy were beaten and pursued beyond the Don
and Volga. In 1150 they are in alliance with Yúri of Suzdal. In 1152,
1154 they reappear in the heart of Russia, in 1155 on the Kanina river
(near Kíev), and there is another great battle in 1160.

After 1160 there is frequent mention of the wild Pólovtsy,: the
implication seems to be that some of them had been settled on Russian
territory, and used as auxiliaries by the territorial princes. Thus in
1172, when Glĕb Yúrevič of Suzdal was on the throne of Kíev, a host of
Pólovtsy invaded, and divided into two sections; one proceeding to
Pereyáslavl’, the other going down the Dnĕpr to Korsún; both sent envoys
to Glĕb to say that God had established him in his ancestral estate at
Kíev, and they wished to settle amongst the Russians who need fear
nothing from them. Terms were arranged with the first section, but not
with the second.

In 1161, 1162, 1165, 1167 (when the Polovsk leader was Bonyák), 1168,
this endless fight continues with the Pólovtsy; in 1172 Glĕb Yúrevič is
found in alliance with the 'wild' Pólovtsy, under Kontsák (or Končák)
against whom Ígoŕ Svyatoslávič, the hero of the Slóvo, made his foray in
1185. In 1173 the relentless nomads ravaged the neighbourhood of Kíev;
but were beaten and pursued as far as the river Bug.

This list of years and invasions might be prolonged; every year seems
the same; the nomads moved forwards with their herds and tents, no doubt
themselves shifted from their old pastures by other tribes who urged
them from the rear. In 1177 the Russians suffered another great defeat:
"God let loose his wrath on us," says the Chronicler in 1177, "and sent
the Pagans; but not in compassion for them; but, as manifesting to us,
turning us to repentance, that we might be deterred from evil paths. For
this is his scourge. . .'--pious reflections, but poor consolation.

Končák appears again in 1178, leading the "godless Ishmaelites, the
desperate sons of Hagar,"; whilst still the princes bickered and
Svyatosláv Vsévolodič in 1180, Prince of Kíev, used these foes in his
quarrel with the treacherous house of Suzdal which had imprisoned his
son Glĕb.

Meanwhile the princes of Suzdal were gradually conquering the Bolgars of
the Volga, a tribe which had almost settled into civic ways.

In 1184 Svyatosláv Vsévolodovič defeated the Polovsk chieftain Kobyák,
an incident mentioned in the Slóvo l. 344. But in that same year
Kontsák, "the desperate and godless and thrice-accursèd," made a very
dangerous inroad, using the 'Greek Fire,' that belched flames out of
long heavy tubes. Unfortunately for the Pólovtsy, their one artificer
was captured, and the Russians won a great victory.

And so the tale of these incursions goes on, until in 1224 the Pólovtsy
disappear from history, wiped out of separate existence by the Tatars,
and merged with the subject Russians.

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

The territory of Kíev and South Russia was being steadily devastated by
these ceaseless incursions of barbarians.

The population was also changing its character. The endless wars
internal and external resulted in great captures of slaves the general
impoverishment of the agricultural population was also contributing to
the enslavement of the Russian people. The husbandman in this insecurity
could not cultivate or pay his debts; as a debtor, he became a закупъ or
debt-serf, who had to pay in labour what he could not absolve in money;
as such, if he ran away or evaded his obligations he lost his freedom
altogether. Prosperity was founded on slave-ownership and, at the end
there were too few freemen left to fight for national freedom.

The composition of the population was changing. When the Pólovtsy
subdued the Pečenegs, the latter were soon absorbed into the mass of the
people, and these Asiatics were allowed to settle on Russian soil. The
remnants of the Pečenegs, the Torks, the Beréndiči, and other similar
tribes were collectively called Black-caps \[черные клобуки\] and used
as auxiliaries of the Prince of Kíev. In like manner Černígov <span
id="fr_4"></span>[†](#fn_4.md) and Galicia drew on other barbarian peoples
as mercenaries.

These ruralized Turanians became the natural allies of the Russians in
defence of their villages and lands; but these admixtures were altering
the composition and so the character of the nation.

To these disturbing factors may be added the continuous emigration
North, to Suzdal, six hundred miles away, where there was something like
a settled government, and above all some immunity from nomad incursion.
These Turanian invaders seem nearly all to have come from the South,
from the shores of the Caspian, North of the Caucasus, and to have
advanced by the steppes watered by the Don, the Volga and their
affluents. This also was the Tatars' line of advance.

Thus South Russia, racked with civil war, depleted by emigration,
repeopled by Asiatics, ravaged year in, year out, by savage foes, and
crippled in her energies by the rapid extention of slave-holding, was
exhausted, the wonder is that she kept up the struggle so long, and gave
such valiant account of herself at the last hopeless contest with the
Mongols.

Something, even though in outline, must be said of the dynastic changes
from 1126, when Vladímir II died, down to the extinction of Russian
freedom by the Tatars and the supersession of Kíev as the seat of the
Grand-Prince.

After the death of Mstíslav I in 1132, the Monomákhovici had to contend
with the Ólgoviči, who aspired to Kíev; with the rivalry of the
descendants of Izyasláv II and Rostíslav I, (i. e. the princes of
Volhynia and the princes of Smolénsk), as well as with the claims of
Suzdal which were governed by the descendants. of Yúri Vladímirovič. On
the death

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

of Izyasláv II, (a prince whom the Chronicle calls honourable, orthodox
and pious; he was certainly a brave warrior), Yúri from 1154-1157 held
the throne of Kíev, for which he had plotted so long and so
indefatigably. The annals from 1157 are mainly occupied with wars with
the princes of Galicia, during which Yarosláv Vladímirkovič was creating
his immense principality \[v. note *sub hoc nomine*\].

In 1169 Mstíslav II Izyáslavič was on the throne, and allied him self
with Nóvgorod in a last attempt to strengthen Kíev against Suzdal, which
under Andréy Bogolybhski Yúrevič (1110-1174) had been steadily growing
and consolidating. A great conspiracy was entered into against, Kíev,
amongst others by the princes of Pereyáslavl’, Smolénsk, Dorogobug,
Ovruc, Vysegórod, Olég and Ígoŕ Svyatoslávic of the house of Černígov.
The expedition was entrusted to Mstíslav, Andréy's son. Kíev was sacked
for two days; "no mercy was shown to anyone; the churches were burnt;
the inhabitants slaughtered, the women led into captivity and separated
from their husbands; and the children sobbed as they saw their mothers'
plight: houses were pillaged: royal robes, icons and books looted; and
all the bells were carried away. All men in Kíev groaned and lamented.
All of this was accomplished for our sins."

Andréy Yúrevič had too mean an opinion of the former capital of Russia
to trouble to occupy the throne; at his orders, his son Mstíslav set up
Glěb Yúrevič as regent.

Suzdal had long been virtually independent. It had taken practically no
share in the defence of Russia against the Pólovtsy, and directed its
energies to expansion Northwards against the pacific Bolgars of the
Volga. Andréy, by the brutal sack of Kíev, turned the current of Russian
history. In 1172 Mstíslav Izyaslavič with the aid of the Galicians \[cf.
1.486 of the text\] re-entered Kíev: and Glěb, to recover his conquest,
utilized the savage Pólovtsy under Končák. In 1173 Román Rostíslavič was
allowed to take the throne of Kíev, on the death of Glĕb, whom the
Chronicle celebrates as one who loved his brothers, held fast by his
oath until death, was gentle, courteous, generous to the church and
charitable. This obituary gathers force by comparison with another of
1174, one Vladímir Mstíslavič who suffered much evil, fleeing to
Galicia, to Hungary or Polovsk-land, for his own fault, that he never
was faithful to his pledged word.

In 1175 the prince of Suzdal already has the title of Grand Prince
\[великій князь\], whilst the ruler at Kíev is appointed and deposed at
his will, and soon called simply Князь кіевцкій like any other local
princelet. In 1175 Andréy Yúrevič, the real founder of the northern
Russian state, was assassinated. He is duly appraised by the Chronicle
for his wisdom and piety, his zeal in building cities, and the greatness
of the state he erected. He was born in the North, was cold and
calculating, unlike the great princes of Kíevite Russia; but he deserves
the lengthy laudation awarded to him by the contemporary Chronicle.

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

Moscow was founded in 1147, and already appears in 1175 and 1176 as a
place of importance. In 1271 it became the capital of Moscovite Russia,
replacing Vladímir, \[the northern town of that name\].

In 1177 Vsévolod Yúrevič succeeded to Andréy as virtual autocrat of the
independent state of Suzdal. He was the master of Russia, controlled the
Ólgoviči of Černígov, from whom he took Ryazán, compensating them with
the gift of Kíev. Thus in 1180 Svyatosláv Vsévolodič, the grandson of
Olég of Tmutarakáń succeeded to the sceptre of Vladímir II.

From all these causes the centre of gravity of medieval Russia gradually
shifted up North; Kíev was left to decay: to be swept into the
subsequent Lithuanian State, and at last to be recovered by Moscow, two
hundred and forty years later, together with the Tatar title of Tsar of
Russia \[Царь бсея Россіи\], after the Tatar dominion had been
overwhelmed by new Turkish invaders, who swept farther South to uproot
the ancient Eastern Empire, and to occupy the impregnable Dardanelles.
