# INTRODUCTION.

### I. THE HISTORY OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

The history of the manuscript of the Slóvo has been often stated. In
1795 Count Musin-Puškin, a distinguished arcæologist, bought from the
archimandrite of the Spaso-Yaroslávski monastery a bound volume of
manuscripts, amongst which was the original of this text. In 1800 he
published the *editio princeps* under the title of a 'A heroic song of
the foray against the Pólovtsy of the hereditary Prince of
Nóvgorod-Sěverski, Ígoŕ Svyatoslávič.' There were 1200 copies printed, a
few of which survived the fire of Moscow in the year 1812 in which the
original MS. and most of the printed copies perished.

Thus this printed book of 1800 was the only original, until Pekárski
discovered a second modern copy amongst the papers of the Empress
Catherine II, an account of which appears *infra*.

The *editio princeps* contains the text with a modern Russian
translation, historical and other notes, an abstract of the action of
the poem, and a preface giving the facts of the discovery. The text is
printed as continuous prose, and there is a long list of *errata* at the
end of the volume. The preface provides no sufficient detail as to the
style, conditions or date of the lost original; nor to what extent, if
any, the editors had adhered and followed it literally, or emended the
orthography in conformity with the standards either of Russian or
Church-Slavonic. From all accounts, Musin-Puškin was an ardent
collector, but an indifferent critic; and, from contemporary evidence it
has been gathered that only six of the learned men of the time ever had
the opportunity of seeing this vanished MS.: amongst them
Bantyš-Kamenski, A. F. Malinovski, A. I. Ermoláev, N. M. Karamzín, R. F.
Tirnkovski and G. N. Boltin. <span id="fr_0"></span>[†](#fn_0.md)

In the preface Musin-Puškin says:--"The original MS. is in very ancient
handwriting. It belongs to the editor who, through his own endeavours
and help received from experts in the Russian language has, in the
course of some years brought this translation to the degree of clearness
desired, and is now at the request of his friends publishing it to the
world at large. But, in despite of all this, there remain some passages
which are unintelligible; so, I beg my kindly readers to submit their
suggestions to me. . . ."

<span id="page_ii">p. ii</span>

Since that date there has been a deluge of editions and criticisms, as a
glance at the bibliography will show. Evidently Musin-Puškin underrated
the interest of his casual purchase.

It appears from the criticisms of Bareov and Tikhonrávov, as well as
from contemporary statements, that the lost MS. was in a sixteenth
century hand unpunctuated and with the words undivided, and Barsov
impugns the handwriting of Musin-Puškin as a contributory cause of
error.

For some years controversy raged on the genuineness of the poem; but the
drift of opinion confirmed authenticity. This poem was flashed on the
world very soon after MacPherson had roused all the scepticism of London
with his Ossian; but the historical exactitude of the Slóvo, the fact
that it had been vouched by a few but notable and responsible persons
soon allayed the doubts.

No other ancient copy has been traced. Petrúševi very plausibly opines
that the reason of the rarity is that the author was a layman with a
strong inclination towards Pagan superstitions--as is plain from the
constant references of Slavonic deities--and that, for this reason, the
poem was anathematized by the Church, which in medieval Russia, even
more than in the rest of Europe was the sole custodian of written
records and the art of writing. "Двоевѣрье" or double faith lingered on
throughout the hastily converted immensities of the Russian Continent
for a very long time; and certainly this poeth betrays no religious
horror of the gods of olden time.

The poem must have been written and completed after 1185 and before
1187; and probably suffered in various transcriptions leading up to the
XVI century original, which fell into Musin-Puškin's hands. Indeed I
suspect that this lost text must have been in two hands; otherwise I
cannot explain the variants in the terminations омъ омь етъ еть etc.,
the relative clarity of some parts and the utter corruption of others,
e.g. the passages referring to Svyatopólk and Tugorkán, the digression
on Vséslav of Polotsk; a cursory glance at my emended text will reveal
how the corrections abound at certain points and cease at others. Other
indications of this are slighter; e.g. Vladlmir is spelled in modern
Russian style with -*mir* towards the end, in older fashion -*mer* in
the beginning: and again the modern Russian genitives in аго and dative
plurals in амъ occur at the end, but not in the beginning; and this
suppositious second copyist seems to have been the more careless of the
two.

However, in 1864, Pekárski, whilst burrowing among the private archives
of Catherine II, lighted on six folios of manuscript, consisting of
chronological and historical notes, many of them in autograph. The
Empress was a keen student of medieval Russia, and, as appears from the
autobiography of Musin-Puškin, very much interested in his collections
of original records. She graciously allowed the Count to lend her some
of his treasures, and, in return gave him access to papers in her own
cabinet, asking him to elucidate manuscripts she found hard to decipher.

<span id="page_iii">p. iii</span>

It follows that he must have been her chief informant on ancient Russian
history: a fact confirmed by the discovery of a second copy of the Slóvo
from the lost eriginal, together with a special abstract of its
contents, special notes, and a new manuscript translation into modern
Russian for her use, She evidently conned this with great attention, as
some of her pencil notes on the margins go to prove. This text is known
as the Архивный списокъ the Archive copy, and is designated "E"
\[Екатерининцкій\] in this edition, the printed text of 1800 being
called П \[Мусинъ-Пушкинъ\]. In the same folio the Empress inserted in
her own hand a number of genealogies of the princes of Kíev.

The variants in these two copies are important and significant.
First,the vocalization of E is generally more in accordance with Russian
than Church Slav usage; in the second place, in a number of corrupt
passages, E supplies a better reading; in fact I take it that in E we
are spared the additional mistakes of the printing house, and I have
adopted it as the original in this book, incorporating the corrected
readings of E. in Simoni's edition of it (1890). The explanatory
documents--the translation, commentary etc.--also differ very slightly.
Thus Yaroslávna is made out to be the wife of Vladímir Ígoŕevič, instead
of Ígoŕ's; the abstract is shorter and more concise; the grammatical
forms especially in regard to the rather indiscriminate use of terminal
ъ and ь regular, though still pointing to an original confusion in the
lost MS. The numerals in E. are marked with the modern Arabic symbols,
not with the old Slav letters with numerical values, a difference of
some considerable critical value in one passage at least, where E. reads
Зояни for Трояни; this possibly proving some connection between the
incomprehensible word Троянъ and the numeral 3, confused with the
Russian letter З. In other cases, where words occur, probably derived
from Eastern sources, already unintelligible to the sixteenth century
copyist \[e.g. Карнаижля, дивица\] E. gives us a better, if more
difficult reading; probably leaving the original as it stood,
uninterpreted.

Obviously, in all these uncertainties and this hopeless field of
conjecture, it would be ridiculous to attempt to fix on an author. But,
as stated in the historical section of this Introduction, the date of
composition is fixed by the eclipse of the sun, by the reference to
Yarosláv of Galicia as alive, and by the appeal for help to contemporary
princes, and must have been in 1185 and 1186; in the latter year the
jubilant conclusion celebrating Ígoŕ's escape (uncontemplated in the
first two parts of the poem) was added to the first draft.

Furthermore, the author must have been an eye-witness; for,his account
of the battle confirms and corroborates the tales of the Chronicles,
supplying other detail; he had strong sympathies with the faction of the
Ólgoviči and the independent house of Polotsk, and shows little
kindliness towards the branch of the ruling family of whom Vladímir II

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

was the greatest and the best. Lastly, the author has a strong and
markedly individual style, avoiding exaggeration and grotesque figures
\[such as are found in the folk-tales, e,g. as extraordinary magic, many
headed monsters etc.\]; and is also free from the loose and inchoate
profuseness of the Ballads, with their rather sploshy and irregular
metre.

Lastly, to hazard a guess, the headings in the Ipatíevski Chronicle for
the years succeeding the events of 1185, often fall into a poetical
style, not altogether dissimilar; and as the writer of the Slóvo shows
accurate acquaintance with the records of the past and often repeats
almost *verbatim* the expressions used in these Chronicles, it is not
improbable that he may have been associated with the production of them.

This Introduction is intended to generalize and collect impressions, for
the proof of which the reader may be referred to the notes on the text,
where instances of such echoes of the Chronicles, and the reading of
MSS, will be found set out at length.

But, it is very unfortunate that the original authority for this poem is
so deficient and faulty.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[i:†](tai04.htm#fr_0.md) Malínovski stated (*teste*
Dubenski) that the MS. was of the end of the XIV century; Ermoláev that
it was of the middle of the XV: Kalaidovič (who did not see it)
pronounced it for the XVI century. At all events it was not the
contemporary copy.
