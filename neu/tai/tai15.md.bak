### §10. THE FOUR GREAT PRINCES.

In the year 1113 Svyatopólk II Izyaslávič died. Like his uncle, Vsévolod
I he had been maintained on the throne by Vladímir.

The citizens of Kíev insisted on Vladímir resuming the office of
Grand-Prince and passing over the claims of the Svyatosláviči, the next
eldest branch of the Yarosláviči, whose record had been none of the best
during the previous reigns. Svyatopólk left no brothers, and his sons
were mere lads. Vladímir Monomákh \[his baptismal name\] ascended the
throne; by so doing, he incurred the hostility of the envious Ólgoviči,
who were now sovereigns in the independent domain of Černígov.

There had, as yet, been three great rulers in Kíevite Russia. The first
of these, Svyatosláv I, was the great conqueror, a Bayard, who worked
with the statesmanlike object of giving his country intelligible
frontiers, to protect it against the nomads and secure the trade-routes

down the Dněpr and on the Black Sea. He shattered the Khozars, and shook
off the Asiatic yoke. His was a romantic figure that compels admiration.

The second is his son Vladímir I. His was a passionate and sensuous
nature, but his impulsiveness was directed to great ends. He re-created
Russian unity; gave Russia a new religious purpose, and, with this end
in view, even attempted to formalize and institute Paganism. He ruled
with vigour and concentrated authority in his own hands at Kíev within
those huge confines (which Svyatosláv could not enlarge).

After him there came the great administrator and law-giver, Yarosláv I.
This monarch had less initiative than his father Vladímir; but he was
just and strong and did all he could to build enduringly on the
foundations laid by Svyatosláv and Vladímir. Yarosláv I made Russia
known to foreign states: one of his daughters married Henry I of France:
another, the King of Hungary.

But the many sons of Yarosláv were unequal to the stupendous task of
maintaining in unity a realm with no defined boundaries, without even
the loose bond of a feudal system, and pertinaciously, relentlessly,
attacked by swarms of nomads from the steppes. During the anarchy of the
succeeding reigns, the natural lines of fissure asserted themselves and
developed; Nóvgorod split off, to enjoy till 1478 (when she was
conquered and destroyed by Moscow) virtual independence, electing and
rejecting what prince she would: Polotsk parted from Russia; and at last
the independence of Smolénsk, Volhynia, Černígov and Galicia had to be
conceded. The domain of Černígov included Moscow, Ryazáń, Vyátka and the
Rádimiči.

At this point of history, medieval Russia's last great ruler steps in, a
man trained to arms, which he had never used except against rebels or
the enemy, the faithful lieutenant of his father Vsévolod I and his
cousin Svyatopólk II, the statesman who adhered to the rules of
succession, imperfect as they were, so as to preserve some safeguard
against arbitrary force. The dismemberment of Russia was inevitable: he
accepted and tried to rebuild on this assumption. But the dilemma was
hopeless. Unless the great estates were made heritable, there would be
no stability, and no contentment of princely ambition: if they were made
heritable, there could be no concerted common action, save by casual
consent. If the old scheme obtained of grants of military posts for
life, the holders would be always dissatisfied, and their sons always in
rebellion. There was no middle course of feudal vassal tenure with a
sovereign overlord.

To a state racked with anarchy within, with its [*morale*](errata.htm#1.md)
broken by living precedents of treachery and alliance for selfish ends
with the Pagan foe, Vladímir II <span id="fr_3"></span>[†](#fn_3.md) at
last succeeded; he left Russia organized enough for common action, so as
to subsist a century longer.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[xxi:†](tai15.htm#fr_3.md) He is generally known as
Vladímir Monomákh; so called after his maternal grandfather Constantine

Мономаховичи.
