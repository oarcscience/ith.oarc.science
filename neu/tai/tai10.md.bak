### §5. THE SCANDINAVIAN PRINCES.

Russian history proper, i.e. the history of the state bearing this name,
with a dynasty enthroned at Kíev, begins with the three brothers Rurix,
Truvor and Sineus, or in Norse, Hrörekr, Thorvardr and Sikniutr.
Probably Rurik only followed in the wake of other Norse precessors; but
in the year 862 he invaded Russia, occupied Nóvgorod, and sailed down
the rivers to Kíev. He retained Nóvgorod for himself, assigning to
Sineus Bělo Ozëro, and to Truvor Izborsk. On their death these military
outposts reverted to Rurik.

Throughout medieval Russian history there is the same eagerness
displayed to gain possession of Kíev. Kíev was the natural mart for the
trade of the Volkhov and the Western Dviná; and the master of Kíev had
the control of Russian trade. All the other cities depended economically
on the good will of Kíev, which soon grew into a rich town with very
numerous churches and eight markets. It was the wealth of Kíev that
enabled the successors of Rurik to maintain the struggle against the
hordes of Asia for three hundred years, despite disaffection within and
disturbance without.

Kíev was left in the possession of Askold and Dir, whilst Rurik
consolidated his power in the North. Rurik died in the year 879, leaving
one son Ígoŕ, a minor, for whom Olég acted as regent.

Olég was the real founder of the Russian state. In 882 he enticed his
kinsmen Askold and Dir out of Kíev (which they had released from the
Khozar yoke) by means of a treacherous invitation to join him on a
trading expedition to Constantinople, and took the opportunity to rid
himself of these rivals. He hastened to make Kíev his capital. During
his long regency (879-912) Olég subdued the whole of Slav Russia, took
Smolénsk and reduced the Drevlyáne, Sěveryáne and Rádimiči to
subjection.

He also created for Russia its first international standing as an
independent state, in 911 concluding the first commercial treaty with
the Greeks, as the outcome of a raid on Constantinople in which the
Russian, ships sailed into the harbour and ravaged the environs.

This treaty, of which the text has come down in the Russian Chronicles,
is of prime importance. It was drafted in Greek and Russian,--

which [proved](errata.htm#0.md) successful, in the course of which he had
established a fortress at Pereyáslavets on the Danube (probably near
Marcianople and below Silistria), Svyatosláv decided on pulling these
chestnuts out of the fire for himself and Russia; and thus, when their
ally was becoming obnoxious, Constantinople suborned the Pečneg allies
of the Russians to rise, and attack Kíev and seize the rapids of the
lower Dněpr, so cutting off the trade-route to the Black Sea.
Svyatosláv, who had been defeated this time at Dristr (or Silistria)
hurried back to face the new enemy, but on his way back was beaten and
slain. His had was cut off and his skull used by the savage Pečenegs as
a drinking-vessel.

But the death of this heroic figure passed almost unnoticed in Russia,
which had during all of the reign been left to itself, whilst the
monarch was away on his remote schemes of conquest.

Svyatosláv left three sons, Yaropólk and Olég, legitimate by a
Scandinavian mother, and a third son, illegitimate, Vladímir, by a Slav
serf Malúša. They were all three under age, and the first partition was
made to provide them all with territory, Yaropólk the eldest being
assigned the capital, Kíev, Olég the region of the Drevlyáne (the land
watered by the Pripet’ and neighbouring streams) and Vladímir the North
with the capital city of Nóvgorod. Civil war soon ensued; and Vladímir,
who, under the tutorship of his maternal uncle, Dobrýnya, had been
partly educated in Scandinavia, and had thence brought with him a fresh
batch of Pagan Norsemen, in 980 assassinated Yaropólk, who had already
dispossessed and killed Olég in 977.

A new epoch may he said to begin with the accession of Vladímir I. The
period of expansion and consolidation was over; the Scandinavian
ascendancy was at the end; Russia was to become Christian and Slavonic.
