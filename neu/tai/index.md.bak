Then Igor gazed up at the bright sun, and saw all his warriors covered
with the darkness \[that proceeded\] out of it. And Igor said to his
druzhina:--"Brothers and druzhina! Better is it to be hewn to pieces
than to be captive! So let us mount, brothers, on our swift steeds and
look upon the blue Don!"

The Story of Igor is a long Russian ballad from the 12th century. This
work is often referred to simply as the Slovo, the Tale (from its
Russian title Slovo o pol'ku Igoreve). In the 12th century Russia was a
small feuding group of city states, without central authority or
cohesion. Fifty years hence, the Mongolians would roll over the Russians
and rule them with an iron fist for two centuries. But at that time the
most persistent enemies of the Russians were the fierce Polovtsi nomads.
They roamed the wide grassy plains of the Don and Dnepr down to the
inland seas, to the south of Russian territory. In 1185 a minor skirmish
between the Polovtsi and Igor Svyatoslavich, a noble of Chernigov, a
city in what it today the Ukraine, was immortalized in this poem.

This was not a strategic battle: Igor had marched with his brothers on a
grudge, having been excluded from a larger expedition, and the encounter
with the enemy was purely impromptu. Nor was it a victory: Igor was
wounded and captured in battle, later escaping to walk back to
Chernigov. Out of this incident, however, was built one of the first
treasures of Russian literature. There are vivid natural metaphors, the
evocation of Slavic pagan deities, and the stirring description of
combat. There an appeal for Russian national unity, as the poet pleads
for each of the factions to support Igor in his hour of need. Even more
striking is the fact that we know nothing about the author of the Slovo,
other than that he was a contemporary of the events he wrote
about--perhaps even a witness.

The Slovo was discovered in 1795 in a bundle of manuscripts purchased
from a monastery. It was published in 1800, although most of the print
run was destroyed along with the original manuscript in 1812 during the
fire which the retreating forces of Napoleon set to Moscow. There have
always been nagging doubts about the authenticity of the poem, because
no other manuscript of it has ever been found. Some have speculated that
this may be because of the explicit pagan beliefs in the Slovo, which
may have led the Church to quietly shelve it. It would be nearly
impossible to forge this text, as it is written in very archaic Russian
which has stood up to modern linguistic studies.

The 19th century opera Prince Igor, by Bordin and Rimsky-Korsakov was
based on the Slovo. An excerpt from this opera, the orchestral
Polovetsian Suite is a staple in the 'pops classical' repertoire.

This, the Magnus translation, is the only public domain English
translation of the Slovo, and it makes its first appearance on the
Internet at this site; it is long out of print and hard to obtain. There
is a notable 1960 translation by Vladimir Nabokov, the author of Lolita
(see box on the right), which is currently out of print but available
used in at least two editions. Nabokov describes Magnus' work as "a
bizarre blend of incredible blunders, fantastic emendations, erratic
erudition and shrewd guesses." However, as this is the only one
currently in the public domain in the US, it will have to suffice. Among
the features of this edition are a dozen genealogical charts of the
Russian noble families of the period, which Nabokov considered very
helpful in preparing his translation.
