### PREFACE.

This is the first English edition of this ancient Russian epic.

It is intended as a handbook to the increasing number of students of the
Russian language, and to reveal to the general public one of the
treasures of Russian medieval literature.

The editor has to express his gratitude to many friends without whose
encouragement and advice it could never have appeared; and, in especial
to Miss J. CURRIE who has drawn the map, as well as to Professor A. P.
GOUDY for his illuminative suggestions.

L. A. M.
