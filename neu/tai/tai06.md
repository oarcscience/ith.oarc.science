## (2) A SUMMARY OF RUSSIAN HISTORY UP TO THE MONGOL CONQUEST.

### §1. THE OLD TRADITION.

The old Russian Chroniclers from whose copious accounts this abstract
has partly been drawn, in right medieval fashion start their tale from
the Flood. A few chapters leads them on to the legendary beginnings of
Russia, and a version of the first migrations of the Slavs. Originally,
so says Nestor, the Slavs dwelt on the Danube in the country of the
Hungarians and Bolgars and took their national nomenclatures from the
rivers by which they settled; such were the Moravians and the Polc áne
from the Morava and the Polota, (an affluent of the. Dviná). '

The progenitors of the Slavs were three brothers, Kyĭ, Šček and Khoriv
and their sister Lybed <span id="fr_2"></span>[†](tai07.htm#fn_2.md), the
eponymous founders of the Polyáne of Kíev, the Čechs and Croatians.

They lived in anarchy without rulers; so they sent an embassy to the
Varangians (the Northmen who were then sweeping all of Europe down to
Constantinople) in the year 848 in these terms:--"Our country is good
and large and fruitful, but there is no good governance in it, because
we have no elders; so come and be our princes in our land and rule over
us."

Such is the traditional story.
