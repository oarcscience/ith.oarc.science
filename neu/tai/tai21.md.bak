### III. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE POEM.

The Slóvo falls into three distinct parts, each of them subdivisible.
The episode eternized by the author is very slight, one of the many
forays against the nomad foes, with whom, for the rest, these Russian
princes never scrupled to ally themselves in their perpetual dynastic
and territorial quarrels. But Ígoŕ, to judge by the space his exploits
occupy in the Chronicles, seems to have been a romantic and impulsive
figure, and this particular raid receives very much more than the usual
allowance of space. Still, to eke out the tale, the author in true epic
style introduces a mass of material, incidental and illustrative.

In the first section of Part I, (l. 1-28) the poet opens by hesitating
whether he shall tell the weary story of Ígoŕ's expedition in the
old-world

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

style of Boyán \[or Yan\], or in contemporary manner, probably like the
ballads, (a diffuse method of narration with many repetitions, and
couched in a loose metre of long lines with four or five accentual
beats). He passes on to a eulogy of Boyán the wizard, whose fingers made
the harpstrings live, in recording the feats of the princes three and
four generations back.

The next section (ll. 29-37) states the scope of the invention of the
author, from Vladímir I to his contemporary Ígoŕ; and passes on to the
third (ll. 38-58) where in words almost identical with the Chronicles,
Ígoŕ, despite the evil omen of an eclipse of the sun (astronomically
verified to the hour) summons his men, he being fierily eager,--as the
Chronicles tell,--to avenge the imagined slight that he had taken no
share in the victory of the previous year 1184.

At l. 38 the action begins in words very nearly identical with the
Chronicles.

The author, in the fourth section (ll. 59-78), characteristically
interrupts the narrative, this time with an invocation of Boyán, whose
inspiration extended back to the legendary days of Troyán, probably
representing the founders of the Scandinavian dynasty. He quotes some of
Boyán's lines, and composes a sequel in the same style, but applicable
to his own day.

In the fifth section (ll. 79-99) the action of the poem is resumed.
Vsévolod in a spirited speech,--which points a moral against others'
indifference,--announces his readiness to help his brother; and the
following division (ll. 100-112) relates how they start, how evil were
the portents.

But (ll. 113-135) the enemy are making their preparations and the
Russian force is cut off from its base.

Section Eight (ll. 136-148) describes the first day of battle, and the
Russian victory, the looting of the Polovsk tents; followed by a night
of ill-judged repose (149-155).

The tenth sub-division gives a brief narrative of the second day's fight
(156-189) and the countless re-inforcements of the barbarian enemy.

Again (section XI, ll. 190-208) other matter is interposed; the
panegyric of Vsévolod who showed such valour; and in section XII (ll.
209-249) there follows a reminiscence of the days of Rurik and Yarosláv
the Great and of Olég of Tmutarakáń, the ancestor of the Ólgoviči, the
house ousted from Kíev by Vladímir II. The exploits of Olég and his
associate Borís Vyáčeslavič, the battle on the Nežátin are mentioned;
the author deplores that the children of the civilizing Sun, the
Russians were and are wasting their blood in internecine strife.

Section XIII (250-284) describes the battle during the next night, and
the morning of the next day; the language is powerful and poetic; the
calamity expressed in words of striking simplicity and pathos. Ígoŕ has
fallen; his banners are the enemy's prize; the brothers are separated.

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

So the first part ends; and the second, the longest, touches on the woes
of Russia consequent on this defeat, and the misery inflicted on her by
her disunion.

The first section (ll. 284-308) is a gruesome account of how Discord
arose, and Ignominy walked abroad. So, too, after this disaster; when
Končák the Polovsk leader used the Greek fire against the cities of
Russia, (ll. 309-331) and the women of Russia wept, and Kíev was
oppressed with grief. The cause is ever the same; civil strife, whilst
the pagan gathers tribute. But this was Russia's secular bane; tinder
the Tatar rule, those immense territories could not combine for defence;
only the iron hand of Moscow could enforce union and despotism.

The third movement of this part (ll. 332-360) continues in the same
strain; that Ígoŕ and Vsévolod have courted disgrace and contrasts
Svyatosláv III, the reigning prince at Kíev, who had in 1184 gained such
a glorious victory. And, all the nations rang with his praise.

At this point (section IV ll. 361-389) the poet interposes another
subject, the Dream of Svyatosláv, and its interpretation by his
*boyárs*. He had dreamed he had been given wine mixed with dust; that
the mainstays of his house had been sapped; for on that fatal Third day
two such mighty princes had been defeated, and the Lights of Russia
extinguished (Section V. ll. 390-413) on the Kayála river; whilst the
maidens rejoiced on the shore of the Black sea.

After this lyric interruption, the poet (section VI II. 414-452) resumes
the lament of Svyatosláy. This "golden word" is terse and moving. Ígoŕ
and Vsévolod are valiant, but headstrong. Yet Svyatosláv sees no aid
approaching from his powerful Galician ally Yarosláv Vladímirkovič who
could summon the mercenaries from beyond the Carpathians. Nor is there
any relief going out to the city of Rim which the Pólovtsy have sacked
and gutted.

At section VII (l. 453) the poet leaves Svyatosláv and addresses the
principal territorial rulers of his time, who are backward in offering
assistance. First of all, he adjures Vsévolod Yúrevič, the sovereign of
Suzdal (the Northern state which had already gained practical supremacy
(ll. 453-464). Vsévolod had in 1182 conducted an expedition against the
Bolgars of the North; if he would help, slaves would be cheap again!

Next (ll. 465-476) he demands succour of Ruric and David Rostíslavič,
princes of Smolénsk.

Thirdly (ll. 477-494) he directs himself to Yarosláv of Galicia, a wise
and circumspect ruler over an immense territory bounded by the
Carpathians for all their length, and bordering on Poland. Yarosláv was
also Ígoŕ's father-in-law.

Fourthly, Roman and Mstíslav Rostíslavič (ll. 495-516) of Smolénsk <span
id="fr_10"></span>[†](#fn_10.md) are besought for aid. These campaigned
beyond the Tátra

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

range of the Carpathians, and amongst the Lithuanians; will they not
turn their arms nearer home to the frontier rivers of the East?

Next, the poet requests help (ll. 517-530) of Ingváŕ and Vsévolod
Yaroslávič of Lutsk, another branch of this prolific house. \[v. the
genealogy\], and joins with them the three Mstíslaviči, their first
cousins. Of all of these the poet records no good done; will they not
bestir themselves?

Now the writer prepares the way for suggestive reminiscences of
chieftains of the past. He recalls (ll. 531-557) the heroic death of
Izyasláv Vasíl’kovič of the house of Polotsk, fighting alone and unaided
of his brothers against the Lithuanians. It is curious that this is one
of the few references for which no authority can be found in the
Chronicles. The tone of these lines carries conviction of their factual
truth and is strong evidence of contemporary authorship. The same
expressions of ceremonial mourning are used of this Izyasláv, as of Ígoŕ
(555-557).

After this long section of the poem, we find a general imprecation
against the sluggishness of the princes of the day, addressed to the
cowardly brother of Svyatosláv III, Yarosláv Vsévolodovič, and to all of
the descendants of the great Vséslav of Polotsk (ll. 558-568). The
writer, whose sympathies are entirely with what the historians regard as
the rebellious houses of Polotsk and the Ólgoviči, still accuses these
princelets of degeneration from ancestral valour, and of utilizing
barbarian mercenaries, rather than fending off the national foe. With
this introduction of Vséslav who revolted so successfully against
Vladímir II, he enters on the ninth section (ll. 569-611).

This is one of the difficult and corupt passages in the text; full of
references which have been the standing puzzles of all interpreters.

The author selects the episode of the battle on the Nemíga, after
Vséslav had sacked Nóvgorod and Pskov, when Vséslav was treacherously
imprisoned at Kíev. For nine months he was chosen Grand Prince of Kíev,
whilst his enemy Izyasláv, the reigning prince, was in exile in Poland;
on Izyasláv's approach he fled secretly by night to Bělgorod and thence
home to Polotsk. Vséslav in the ballads was turned into a wizard, and in
these passages the writer of the Slóvo accumulates a perplexing detail
of mythological and superstitious lore, with incidental mention of those
riddling persons Boyán and Troyán.

From Vséslav (ll. 611-620) the poet passes on to a brief mention of
Vladímir I, whose energy was never abated.

A new section opens (ll. 621-662) the lament of Evfrósyna Yaroslávna,
Ígoŕ's wife. It is not too much to say that this portion of the poem is
one of the most beautiful heroic lyrics known. It is no doubt based on
some pagan incantation of the four elements and splits up into four
sections, her resolve to bind her hero's wounds, her appeals to the
Wind, the Water and the Sun.

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

The third great division of the poem opens at line 663. It is very short
and has the appearance, (as has been suggested by Sederholm and others)
of being a subsequent addition. This poem must have been written
immediately after the disaster, as the appeals for help go to show. When
Ígoŕ escaped, this jubilant appendix was added.

The first section (ll. 663-693) describes how Ígoŕ escaped at night from
captivity, during a drunken feast. He had to be persuaded against his
will, and removed by his fear of being murdered before he would adopt
this course of breaking parole. His groom Ovlur, Vlur or Lavor obtained
him the means of evasion.

There follows (ll. 694-718) a curious dialogue between Ígoŕ and the
river Donéts, in which the clemency of the river-god to Ígoŕ is
contrasted with the cruelty of the Stugná to young Rostíslav Vsévolodic
at the battle of 1093 against the Pólovtsy.

Still more remarkable is the following section (ll. 719-744), a
conversation between Gzak and Končák, the Polovsk leaders: the good
omens cease and these two discuss what will be the outcome of the
escape. They say that Ígoŕ's son will marry a daughter of one of their
chieftains during his captivity, but this will not be to the advantage
of the nomads.

The fourth section (ll. 745-753) contains a reference, possibly a
quotation, from Boyán, probably an outline of the history of the princes
whom he celebrated; and the quotation is made to bear upon the Ígoŕ of
1185.

The fifth section (751-770) concludes the poem and mainly consists of an
account of Ígoŕ's return, the joy it spread, and a conventional ending
not unlike that of the later ballads: some of this conclusion might be
spurious.

Allusions and historical references are very aptly introduced, and serve
to make, out of the bard's commemoration, a little epic in which the
life of medieval Russia is faithfully and appositely illustrated; one,
too in which much poetry of very high quality abounds.
