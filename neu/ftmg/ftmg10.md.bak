### VII

### THE FAIRY RING

PETROS GOURAS! The name rang through all the Peloponnesus, and every
tongue that spoke it spoke in praise and every ear that heard it
listened in admiration. Petros came of a noble family of warriors, rich
and powerful, with lands, herds, gold, and rare beauty of form and
feature, as his heritage.

Three days after the birth of Petros, his fairy grandmother, Selena,
came to offer blessings and gifts. She brought her grandson a bag of
incense and hung it about his neck to protect him from evil. Three
kisses she gave him for the Holy Trinity and then from her leather bag
she drew a ring. It was a ring such as no one in all that country had
ever seen.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The gold band was
delicately fashioned and engraved with strange figures, and the jewel
caught the light in its crimson heart and flashed it out again with
dazzling radiance.

"This is my gift to my grandson," said Selena as she kissed the ring
three times. "He shall not put it on his finger until the day he is
twenty-one years old, for only then will he be strong enough and wise
enough to wear it." She made the sign of the cross upon the head of the
child, upon the head of the mother and upon the ring, and touching the
heart of mother and child, she went away, murmuring words that no one
could understand.

The ring was a magic ring which the queen of the fairies had bestowed
upon Selena when she was a fairy maiden. It would have made her queen,
and it was her most beloved treasure until one day on the Eagle's Hill
she saw Panàgos Gouras. Then Selena remembered that fairy queens never
marry. Mortal youths are only their slaves. Suddenly the idea of being a
queen lost its fascination.

Selena kept the image of Panàgos ever before her. Sometimes she would go
to the spot on the Eagle's Hill where she had seen him, and weep,
wishing she need never go back to the fairy palace. One day, after three
years, Panàgos Gouras came upon her thus as he was on his way to the
Laconian Gulf to meet a ship from the Aegean. At his first glimpse of
Selena he vowed never to part from her. He did not meet his ship; he did
not reach the Laconian Gulf; he took the beautiful fairy maiden back
with him to his home among the hills. Selena thus renounced the right to
queenship for the

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

love of a mortal, and became the grandmother of the far-famed Petros
Gouras.

The fairy grandmother was as beautiful as the moon, the loveliest woman
in the land. Panàgos, her husband, was no less beautiful, and he was one
among the many warriors in his family who defended the hills of Taegetos
against the Turks and allowed no Turkish foot to step thereon. Because
of Selena the family was called *Neraidogenemanoi*, and its descendants
ever after were the fairest, richest and most noble in that part of
Lacedemonia.

When Petros grew to the stature of a man and could fight the Turks side
by side with his father, he was given the fairy ring and told by his
mother all that she knew of it. Petros kept it in his selahe, and often
while alone on the hills he would look at it, wonder where it had come
from, and dream of fairies, their flower gardens and their palaces, as
though he saw them in the strange figures on the ring.

Petros reached his twentieth year. He was alone one day upon the
*Aetorahe*, Eagle's Hill, from where he could gaze far away to the east
where the Eurotas River rolls. It was springtime; the hills of Taegetos
were abloom; cedars, firs and pines gave to the breeze their rich odors;
birds sang; and shepherdesses danced on the hills to the music of flutes
which their sweethearts played. Petros’ heart was filled with vague
longings. He took out the ring and gazed into the bright depths of the
jewel.

"I am nearly twenty-one," he thought. "I am old enough to fight the
Turks. Surely I am strong enough and wise

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

enough to wear the ring. What harm could there be in it? Besides, who
would know?"

He looked about. His dogs were sleeping near him. Quiet filled the land,
for it was mid-day and the field workers were at rest in the shadows of
trees. Swiftly, as though not to be seen, he slipped the ring on his
finger.

All was as it had been for a moment. Then far away on the Laconian Gulf
three cloud-like chariots with leaping white horses, and an army of
strange, fairy forms appeared, moving toward him. With incredible speed
they came on and in an instant the Aetorahe was enveloped in them, while
music and voices and the beating of drums echoed through all the hills.
Petros was lifted onto a white horse. The earth seemed to slip away from
him and drop down, down. There was no sensation of motion, only a great
wind in his face, and hills, trees and streams whirling beneath him.

Then he could not distinguish any objects below. All about him was
cloud. The sunlight was dim and even the faces of the fairy host were
blurred and indistinct. At last after what seemed days and days of
riding without motion on the horse's back, Petros saw ahead a mysterious
shore. A city of mist rested upon it and was faintly reflected in the
cloudy sea on which they floated. A palace of pearl could be seen from
afar, like a pile of foam glimmering in the faded light. The great
silver gate of the city at the very edge of the sea, admitted them
through the banked cloud walls to the pearl-studded path to the palace.

Petros was assisted to the ground. Throngs of fairy

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

maidens in white, with chains of pearls entwined with flowers, greeted
him in song and led him to the palace. The path lay between gardens of
white roses, roses of thirty petals, of a hundred petals, of a thousand
petals, whose perfume hung heavy above them. The maidens parted, bowing
on either hand while Petros passed up the sixty-six silver steps that
led into the hall.

Fairies in blue, in white and in gray, colors of the sky, surrounded
him. Strange notes, sweet as the murmur of the Eurotas, fell upon his
ears. The inner walls of the palace were festooned with cloud-like
draperies caught with pearls. In the center of the main hall was a
crystal fountain and beyond it, as behind a shimmering veil, the fairy
queen sat upon her throne.

Petros was dazzled, but the queen smiled reassuringly and spoke in the
gentlest of voices.

"Petros Gouras, I have a favor to ask of you."

"Oh queen," murmured the young man, almost overwhelmed by her beauty and
by the strangeness of all that was happening, "oh queen, ask anything
you wish of me."

"My dearest desire in the world," she explained, "is to possess the ring
that you wear on your finger. This jewel may mean only a little to you,
but to me it is more precious than all things else."

Instinctively Petros held out his hand and looked at the ring. He had
not thought of it since the appearance of the fairy hosts. He would have
given much to please the queen, but the ring was the gift of his fairy
grandmother.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

"Ask anything but this, oh queen, I beg of you, for this only I cannot
give."

The queen's frown seemed to darken the room. She arose and with an
imperious gesture summoned fifty of her servants.

"Take the ring from him," she ordered, "and bring it to me."

In spite of Petros’ resistance, she was instantly obeyed. Joyfully she
seized the ring, but in a flash her expression changed to angry
disappointment, almost fear.

"Oh!" she cried. "A cross upon it! A mortal's work! Give it back to him.
Give it back. Evil upon my palace. Take him away! Take him away!"

Again the queen's command was immediately carried out. The ring was
placed on his finger and Petros was rushed down the steps, along the
path, through the gate and on horseback across the mysterious sea of
foam to the top of the Aetorahe. When he had time to catch his breath
and look about, the fairies had disappeared and he was sitting in the
same spot as before with his dogs asleep near by.

Petros wished then that he had obeyed his grandmother's warning and
waited until he was twenty-one. Still, he had escaped. The cross Selena
had made upon the ring saved it for him. Probably now, he reasoned, the
fairies would never try again to take it. He might just as well go on
wearing it.

Months passed. The father and mother of Petros were both dead. A strange
disease fell upon his herds and their vast numbers were reduced by more
than half. Thieves one

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

night broke into Petros’ house, murdered the old servant who had guarded
it for years, and escaped with all the gold and jewels they could carry.
Crops failed. Part of the land had to be sold. Petros, who had not known
illness, moved about thin and wan. His pride, that had been fed by envy
and adulation, had to endure pity from all who saw him. He neglected the
supervision of his fields and flocks, to wander over the hills in search
of wild plants for potions. Every remedy suggested by wise old women,
eager with advice, he tried. He made offerings, and of the riches that
remained gave lavishly to the poor. But evil was upon his house and
nothing availed against it.

Ten months before he would reach the age of twenty-one, Petros heard of
a sorceress, Nessena, who in passing through the country, had taken up a
temporary abode among the highest rocks of the Taegetos. When he learned
that even the *Archontes*, chiefs, of Lacedemonia went to consult her on
mystical matters, he decided to ask her help in his trouble. Through a
friend he was given an audience and was told to meet Nessena at the top
of the Eagle's Hill at twelve o'clock on the night of the next full
moon.

Painfully Petros climbed the Aetorahe and waited. At the appointed hour,
old Nessena, wrinkled and bent, hobbled out from among her rocks. The
instant she saw Petros, she drew herself up, raised her stick above her
head and cried out:

"A curse! A curse is upon you!" Her flashing eyes were fixed upon him
while she told him all his history, as though she were reading it in his
face. "You have about you," she

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

continued, "yes, I see you are wearing it upon your left hand, a fairy
ring. You were not to put on that ring until you should be twenty-one
years of age, and I see that ten months must yet roll by before that
time arrives. Imprudent young man!"

"Imprudent and wretched," Petros accused himself.

"Do not speak, do not stop me!" cried the sorceress. "The ring has
magical power, giving the wearer control over fairies, if he knows how
to use it. You do not know, my boy, and you have exposed yourself to all
manner of danger. Until you are twenty-one, the fairies can and will
continue to persecute you through yourself and all that is dear to you."

"But, oh wise one, is there no remedy, no cure?"

"Do you not wish to wait the ten months for knowledge of the ring's
power to be given you?"

"I would not wait one single hour, if there is any means to be cured
immediately!"

"I see that you are in earnest," said Nessena. "Listen then. I shall
tell you what to do:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"If forever you would be free,  
   Kiss the ring thrice. Away, away,  
 Cast it into Eurotas’ sea,  
   Go, go, obey, obey!

"Three nights from now in the night's noon  
   (The cross cannot save you. Away, away.)  
 Let no one see you beneath the moon.  
   Go, go, obey, obey!"

</div>

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

On the third night at the time set, Petros stood on the banks of the
Eurotas. The night was beautiful with its bright moon and countless
stars. The waters were calm, softly murmuring secrets to the sky. The
land was deserted; not a soul was awake; not a breath stirred. Mounting
to the peak of a high, lone rock, Petros kissed the ring three times and
cast it far out into the water. Instantly three fairies with angel faces
and garments of gleaming white floated down and danced on the water
about the spot where the ring fell. Joy was in their faces and joy in
the swift movements of their dance. They watched the ripples spread
wider and wider until the outer circle touched the shore, when like a
bubble they separated and vanished into space.

Peace came to the house of Gouras. Petros regained his health; his
flocks prospered and increased; the earth sent forth an abundance; the
old property boundaries were restored and gold again filled the bags of
the treasure room. To the end of his days Petros enjoyed nothing more
than to recount the story of his fairy grandmother's gift.
