### III

### THE FAIRY WIFE

DEMETROS, the goatherd, lived alone with his mother on the Keafa Hill.
Near his hut and the *strounga*, a shed for the goats, was a spring
named *Neraidovreshe*, Fairy Spring, for the fairies that had been seen
there. Usually Demetros’ mother went to this spring with her great
earthen jar to get their water, but one day she fell ill and Demetros
had to go for it at night after his goats were driven home.

Since it was moonlight, he could see clearly, when he reached the
Neraidovreshe, that three maidens in white were sitting on the stones at
the edge. Supposing them to be shepherdesses who had come a long way for
water and had stopped to rest, Demetros paid them no attention until he
had

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

filled his jar. At that moment a cock's crow sounded across the valley
and, without a word, the maidens rose, joined hands and danced westward
across the hills, singing and whirling around, faster and faster, until
they disappeared like a wisp of white smoke.

Demetros watched them, wondering who they were, why they had come and
where they had gone. He said nothing about these strange maidens, but he
could think of nothing else all the next day. When night came he went
again to the Neraidovreshe. It was about the same time, the moon was
shining, the maidens were there; but now in addition to the first three
there were three others. Just as the cock crowed the maidens rose,
danced over the hills, singing, and vanished as before.

Demetros filled his water-jar and walked home with his head bent,
thinking. He was so quiet that his mother asked if anything were wrong.
He hesitated a little and then told her what he had seen on the two
evenings.

"Beware, my son!" she cried. "The maidens may be fairies. Evil may come.
Beware!"

The mother was still no better the next night and for the third time
Demetros went to the Neraidovreshe. This time nine maidens in white were
sitting on the stones. Once again the same things happened: a cock
crowed, the maidens rose and danced away in the moonlight, singing.

"Is there any harm in watching them?" the goatherd asked himself. "They
are so strange, so beautiful!" This time he forgot to fill the water-jar
and he walked

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

home still gazing westward at the far line of hills where the fairies
had disappeared.

"You must have seen them again!" his mother cried. Demetros nodded.
"Then go not again to the Neraidovreshe," she warned. "It would be
better to die of thirst. See! already you come back without water in the
jar. To-morrow night is the night of the full moon when fairies’ power
is greatest. To-morrow night you must not leave the strounga!"

Demetros intended to obey his mother. All day he sat on the hillside,
watching his goats and thinking of the maidens.

"I will not go to-night," he told himself. "I will never see them again.
I do not want to see them. They might bring evil to my mother and me. I
will not see them—how beautiful they were!"

That night he put his goats in the strounga as usual. Outside the door
he looked up at the full moon and remembered the three other nights when
he had gone to the spring. How lightly the maidens had danced! How
brightly their golden hair had shown as it rippled over their shoulders!

It was now almost midnight and before Demetros knew what he was doing,
he found himself hurrying toward the Neraidovreshe. He tried to stop,
but he was powerless, as though he were being drawn on and on in spite
of himself. He reached the spring and found ten maidens waiting for him.
Nine he had seen the night before and he had thought them all lovely,
but the one they had brought with them was many times fairer than they.
She was more slender and graceful,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

with brighter, more abundant hair, and her face was more lovely than
anything Demetros had ever imagined. Even the flowers she wore about her
head were sweeter and the little handkerchief she carried was finer and
more delicately embroidered than those of the nine others.

The ten maidens rose, joined hands in a circle about Demetros and danced
around and around, never touching the ground. They sang in their silvery
voices (hers the sweetest of all) and this time he could understand
their song.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh, to be light and oh, to be light  
   In the summer noonday sun;  
 Oh, to be light in the fairy night  
   When moon gossamers are spun;  
 On the sea sands bright and the hill snows white,  
   To run and to run and to run!

 "Oh, to be gay and oh, to be gay  
   Where bright rivers glide and glance;  
 In gardens of May to skip and play  
   While fairy flutes entrance;  
 Oh, to be gay, and away and away  
   To dance and to dance and to dance!

 "Oh, to be free and oh, to be free  
   As the north wind riding high;  
 Oh to be free with the lilting sea  
   When the wild waves wash the sky;  
 Oh, swift and free and a fairy to be,  
   To fly and to fly and to fly!"

</div>

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

Suddenly Demetros longed to be as light and gay and free as they.

"Come with us," begged the ten maidens. "Come with us, Demetros."

"Come and live in our palace with us," said the tenth fairy with her
loveliest smile. "We shall make you happy, Demetros."

Unable to resist, he went with them a long way over the hills. He
laughed and sang and forgot everything but the fairy maidens, their
flowers, their smiles, their golden hair. Once he thought of his mother,
ill and in need of him, and of his goats that would cry for him in the
morning. He knew he should not go any farther with the fairies, but when
he looked at the tenth, the most beautiful, he felt that he could not
leave her as long as he lived.

Now the loveliest one was near him in the dance. Her long golden hair
was sweeping past him. He breathed the fragrance of her flowers. He
reached out to catch her, but only her handkerchief remained in his
hand. The dance stopped. There was a scream from all the fairies. With a
rush, like wind through a forest, they shot upward and disappeared—all
but the tenth. She sank down upon the ground with a kind of moan and hid
her face in her hands.

Demetros stood for a long while looking down at his beautiful prisoner.
Then he fell to his knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but
nothing that he did could stop her tears.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

"Do not speak. Do not touch me," she said. "You have taken from me my
freedom, my happiness!"

Demetros did not know what to do. He stood up, tucked the handkerchief
into his *selahe*, leather belt, and walked slowly a little way off,
thinking. When he turned he saw that she had risen and was following
him, weeping and reluctant. He walked on and she came after, stopping
when he stopped, moving forward as he did, until they crossed the hills
to the little hut that was his home.

His mother was startled when she saw this strange, golden-haired maiden
with her son. She welcomed the stranger, however, and because she saw
that Demetros loved her, she kept the wonderful handkerchief wrapped in
silk and locked in a box in her own room where the fairy wife never
entered.

Katena, so she was called, spent her time spinning, sewing and
embroidering. She made beautiful clothes for Demetros’ mother, for
herself and for the little child when it came. Everybody in Loutro knew
that Katena was a fairy, because whatever she did was finer and lovelier
than anyone else could do in all that part of the country. The child,
too, was very beautiful, with fine, golden hair and soft, white skin.
All the villagers and country people called her *Neraidokoretso*, which
means fairy child.

But Katena was not happy. Demetros could do nothing to make her smile.
She never danced or sang or laughed, but sat quietly at her work,
scarcely glancing up or speaking a

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

word to anyone. Demetros became very sad, and to see him so unhappy made
his mother grieved and anxious. This went on for seven years.

One Saint Konstantinos day the mother went, as is the custom, to a
neighboring village to visit a cousin named Konstantinos. She left,
believing everything safe until her return.

Katena said to Demetros: "To-day is a holiday. I should like very much
to go to Loutro to dance. I have not danced for a long time. Will you
bring out one of my pretty dresses and my best handkerchief? We shall
dance together as we danced on the night of the full moon seven years
ago."

Demetros could not speak for his delight. His beautiful wife would dance
and be happy again. He fumbled with the keys which his mother had left
in his care; he caught up the first dress his eyes fell upon; he took
the beautiful handkerchief from his mother's box and put it into his
selahe with trembling hands. As soon as Katena was ready, she and
Demetros with Neraidokoretso hastened down the hill to Loutro.

The folk were already dancing on the grass plot in the center of the
village, their bright costumes, joyous faces and graceful movements
making an attractive picture. They formed a great circle, but instead of
joining hands they held opposite corners of a handkerchief stretched
between each two of them. Katena and Demetros stepped into the circle,
holding between them the fairy handkerchief which his mother had guarded
these seven years.

Katena's turn came to lead the dance. Demetros dropped

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

his corner of the handkerchief. Katena sprang from him and went whirling
madly about the circle. Demetros watched her amazed. Three times she
circled before the astonished villagers, then rose as though on wings
and floated like a cloud into the sky.

Demetros was heart-broken. When he realized that his fairy wife had left
him forever, he wanted to die. His mother, returned from her cousin
Konstantinos’, tried to console him.

"My son," she said, "this is the evil which the fairy has brought upon
us. Let us try to be content. Now nothing worse can come to us."

Demetros feared that Neraidokoretso would be unhappy without her mother,
but every morning the child would hurry away to the fields and in the
evening run home again, skipping and singing as she came. People said
they often heard her talking or chanting to herself in words no one
could understand.

Her grandmother was frightened at first because she could not induce the
child to eat anything. One morning Demetros followed Neraidokoretso. She
went straight to the Fairy Spring and, looking up, held her little arms
toward the sky. Demetros heard her calling and he saw something white
like a mist descending to her. A silvery voice came out of the mist and
the child answered in words of strange sound.

"It is Katena," he told his mother. "She must come every day to talk to
Neraidokoretso and to feed her fairy food. That is why she is in the
fields all day and will eat nothing here. Katena is caring for her
child."

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

As the years went by Neraidokoretso grew more lovely, always more like
her mother, with long, shining hair and the same beautiful smile. When
she went to the fields now she took her sewing or embroidery and worked
while she talked with the spirit that no one else could see. Often
Demetros followed her and watched her wonderingly. She was his daughter,
but she never seemed to belong to him. She did not need him and was
happy without him or anything he could do for her. She was so much more
a fairy than a human child that it made him afraid. He once said to his
mother: "I believe something worse can happen to us than the trouble we
have already suffered."

"How can that be, my son?" she asked.

"I am afraid that Neraidokoretso will not always be with us."

Demetros and his mother looked at each other without speaking. They both
loved Neraidokoretso very much.

On the girl's fifteenth birthday her father followed her to the
Neraidovreshe, as he had done every day for a long time. He saw again
the white mist come to her out of the clouds and heard the sweet,
silvery voice. She held up her arms and the mist, enfolding her, lifted
her up and carried her away. After it had vanished, Demetros caught the
echo of two fairy voices. He listened motionless as long as he could
distinguish the sound. Then he knew that Katena and Neraidokoretso had
gone from him forever.

Demetros did not keep his goats any more. He wandered day after day
through the fields and woods and over the hills,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

looking hopelessly for his wife and child. Sometimes a shepherd or
goatherd, meeting him, would hear him chanting to himself:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Come back, come back, my fairy wife.  
   Come back, my fairy child.  
 Seeking and searching I spend my life;  
   I wander lone and wild.  
             Come back!"

</div>
