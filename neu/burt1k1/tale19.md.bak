# THE SECOND VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN

  KNOW, O my brother, that I was living a most comfortable and enjoyable
life, in all solace and delight, as I told you yesterday, until one day
my mind became possessed with the thought of traveling about the world
of men and seeing their cities and islands, and a longing seized me to
traffic and to make money by trade. Upon this resolve I took a great
store of cash and buying goods and gear fit for travel, bound them up in
bales. Then I went down to the riverbank, where I found a noble ship and
brand-new about to sail equipped with sails of fine cloth and well
manned and provided. So I took passage in her, with a number of other
merchants, and after embarking our goods, we weighed anchor the same
day. Right fair was our voyage, and we sailed from place to place and
from isle to isle, and whenever we anchored we met a crowd of merchants
and notables and customers, and we took to buying and selling and
bartering.

  At last Destiny brought us to an island, fair and verdant, in trees
abundant, with yellow-ripe fruits luxuriant, and flowers fragrant and
birds warbling soft descant, and streams crystalline and radiant. But no
sign of man showed to the descrier- no, not a blower of the fire. The
captain made fast with us to this island, and the merchants and sailors
landed and walked about, enjoying the shade of the trees and the song of
the birds, that chanted the praises of the One, the Victorious, and
marveling at the works of the Omnipotent King. I landed with the rest,
and, sitting down by a spring of sweet water that welled up among the
trees, took out some vivers I had with me and ate of that which Allah
Almighty had allotted unto me. And so sweet was the zephyr and so
fragrant were the flowers that presently I waxed drowsy and, lying down
in that place, was soon drowned in sleep.

  When I awoke, I found myself alone, for the ship had sailed and left
me behind, nor had one of the merchants or sailors bethought himself of
me. I searched the island right and left, but found neither man nor
Jinn, whereat I was beyond measure troubled, and my gall was like to
burst for stress of chagrin and anguish and concern, because I was left
quite alone, without aught of worldly gear or meat or drink, weary and
heartbroken. So I gave myself up for lost and said: "Not always doth the
crock escape the shock. I was saved the first time by finding one who
brought me from the desert island to an inhabited place, but now there
is no hope for me." Then I fell to weeping and wailing and gave myself
up to an access of rage, blaming myself for having again ventured upon
the perils and hardships of voyage, whenas I was at my ease in mine own
house in mine own land, taking my pleasure with good meat and good drink
and good clothes and lacking nothing, neither money nor goods. And I
repented me of having left Baghdad, and this the more after all the
travails and dangers I had undergone in my first voyage, wherein I had
so narrowly escaped destruction, and exclaimed, "Verily we are, Allah's,
and unto Him we are returning!"

  I was indeed even as one mad and Jinn-struck, and presently I rose and
walked about the island, right and left and every whither, unable for
trouble to sit or tarry in ay one place. Then I climbed a tall tree and
looked in all directions, but saw nothing save sky and sea and trees and
birds and isles and sands. However, after a while my eager glances fell
upon some great white thing, afar off in the interior of the island. So
I came down from the tree and made for that which I had seen, and
behold, it was a huge white dome rising high in air and of vast compass.
I walked all around it, but found no door thereto, nor could I muster
strength or nimbleness by reason of its exceeding smoothness and
slipperiness. So I marked the spot where I stood and went round about
the dome to measure its circumference, which I found fifty good paces.
And as I stood casting about how to gain an entrance, the day being near
its fall and the sun being near the horizon, behold, the sun was
suddenly hidden from me and the air became dull and dar! Methought a
cloud had come over the sun, but it was the season of summer, so I
marveled at this and, lifting my head, looked steadfastly at the sky,
when I saw that the cloud was none other than an enormous bird, of
gigantic girth and inordinately wide of wing, which as it flew through
the air veiled the sun and hid it from the island.

  At this sight my wonder redoubled and I remembered a story I had heard
aforetime of pilgrims and travelers, how in a certain island dwelleth a
huge bird, called the "roc," which feedeth its young on elephants, and I
was certified that the dome which caught my sight was none other than a
roc's egg. As I looked and wondered at the marvelous works of the
Almighty, the bird alighted on the dome and brooded over it with its
wings covering it and its legs stretched out behind it on the ground,
and in this posture it fell asleep, glory be to Him who sleepeth not!
When I saw this, I arose and, unwinding my turban from my head, doubled
it and twisted it into a rope, with which I girt my middle and bound my
waist fast to the legs of the roc, saying in myself, "Peradventure this
bird may carry me to a land of cities and inhabitants, and that will be
better than abiding in this desert island." I passed the night watching
and fearing to sleep, lest the bird should fly away with me unawares,
and as soon as the dawn broke and morn shone, the roc rose off its egg
and spreading its wings with a great cry, flew up into the air dragging
me with it, nor ceased it to soar and to tower till I thought it had
reached the limit of the firmament. After which it descended earthward,
little by little, till it lighted on the top of a high hill.

  As soon as I found myself on the hard ground, I made haste to unbind
myself, quaking for fear of the bird, though it took no heed of me nor
even felt me, and loosing my turban from its feet, I made off with my
best speed. Presently I saw it catch up in its huge claws something from
the earth and rise with it high in air, and observing it narrowly, I saw
it to be a serpent big of bulk and gigantic of girth, wherewith it flew
away clean out of sight. I marveled at this, and faring forward, found
myself on a peak overlooking a valley, exceeding great and wide and deep
and bounded by vast mountains that spired high in air. None could descry
their summits for the excess of their height, nor was any able to climb
up thereto. When I saw this, I blamed myself for that which I had done
and said: "Would Heaven I had tarried in the island! It was better than
this wild desert, for there I had at least fruits to eat and water to
drink, and here are neither trees nor fruits nor streams. But there is
no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!
Verily, as often as I am quit of one peril I fall into a worse danger
and a more grievous."

  However, I took courage and walking along the wady, found that its
soil was of diamond, the stone wherewith they pierce minerals and
precious stones and porcelain and onyx, for that it is a dense stone and
a dure, whereon neither iron nor hardhed hath effect, neither can we cut
off aught therefrom nor break it, save by means of loadstone. Moreover,
the valley swarmed with snakes and vipers, each big as a palm tree, that
would have made but one gulp of an elephant. And they came out by night,
hiding during the day lest the rocs and eagles pounce on them and tear
them to pieces, as was their wont, why I wot not. And I repented of what
I had done and Allah, I have made haste to bring destruction upon
myself!" The day began to wane as I went along, and I looked about for a
place where I might pass the night, being in fear of the serpents, ace
for my and I took no thought of meat and drink in my concern for my
life. Presently, I caught sight of a cave near-hand, with a narrow
doorway, so I entered, and seeing a great stone close to the mouth, I
rolled it up and stopped the entrance, saying to myself, "I am safe here
for the night, and as soon as it is day, I will go forth and see what
Destiny will do." Then I looked within the cave and saw at the upper end
a great serpent brooding on her eggs, at which my flesh quaked and my
hair stood on end, but I raised my eyes to Heaven and, committing my
case to fate and lot, abode all that night without sleep till daybreak,
when I rolled back the stone from the mouth of the cave and went forth,
staggering like a drunken man and giddy with watching and fear and
hunger.

  As in this sore case I walked along the valley, behold, there fell
down before me a slaughtered beast. But I saw no one, whereat I marveled
with great marvel and presently remembered a story I had heard aforetime
of traders and pilgrims and travelers- how the mountains where are the
diamonds are full of perils and terrors, nor can any fare through them,
but the merchants who traffic in diamonds have a device by which they
obtain them; that is to say, they take a sheep and slaughter and skin it
and cut it in pieces and cast them down from the mountaintops into the
valley sole, where, the meat being fresh and sticky with blood, some of
the gems cleave to it. Then they leave it till midday, when the eagles
and vultures swoop down upon it and carry it in their claws to the
mountain summits, whereupon the merchants come and shout at them and
scare them away from the meat. Then they come, and taking the diamonds
which they find sticking to it, go their ways with them and leave the
meat to the birds and beasts, nor can any come at the diamonds but by
this device.

  So when I saw the slaughtered beast fall (he pursued) and bethought me
of the story, I went up to it and filled my pockets and shawl girdle and
turban and the folds of my clothes with the choicest diamonds, and as I
was thus engaged, down fell before me another great piece of meat. Then
with my unrolled turban and lying on my back, I set the bit on my breast
so that I was hidden by the meat, which was thus raised above the
ground. Hardly had I gripped it when an eagle swooped down upon the
flesh and, seizing it with his talons, flew up with it high in air and
me clinging thereto, and ceased not its flight till it alighted on the
head of one of the mountains, where, dropping the carcass he fell to
rending it. But, behold, there arose behind him a great noise of
shouting and clattering of wood, whereat the bird took fright and flew
away. Then I loosed off myself the meat, with clothes daubed with blood
therefrom, and stood up by its side. Whereupon up came the merchant who
had cried out at the eagle, and seeing me standing there, bespoke me
not, but was affrighted at me and shook with fear.

  However, he went up to the carcass and, turning it over, found no
diamonds sticking to it, whereat he gave a great cry and exclaimed:
"Harrow, my disappointment! There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah with Whom we seek refuge from Satan the stoned!" And he
bemoaned himself and beat hand upon hand, saying: "Alas, the pity of it!
How cometh this?" Then I went up-to him and he said to me, "Who art
thou, and what causeth thee to come hither?" And I: "Fear not, I am a
man and a good man and a merchant. My story is a wondrous and my
adventures marvelous and the manner of my coming hither is prodigious.
So be of good cheer. Thou shalt receive of me what shall rejoice thee,
for I have with me great plenty of diamonds and I will give thee thereof
what shall suffice thee, for each is better than aught thou couldst get
otherwise. So fear nothing." The man rejoiced thereat and thanked and
blessed me. Then we talked together till the other merchants, hearing me
in discourse with their fellow, came up and saluted me, for each of them
had thrown down his piece of meat.

  And as I went off with them and told them my whole story, how I had
suffered hardships at sea and the fashion of my reaching the valley. But
I gave the owner of the meat a number of the stones I had by me, so they
all wished me joy of my escape, saying: "By Allah, a new life hath been
decreed to thee, for none ever reached yonder valley and came off thence
alive before thee, but praised be Allah for thy safety!" We passed the
night together in a safe and pleasant place, beyond measure rejoiced at
my deliverance from the valley of Serpents and my arrival in an
inhabited land. And on the morrow we set out and journeyed over the
mighty range of mountains, seeing many serpents in the valley, till we
came to a fair great island wherein was a garden of huge champhor trees
under each of which a hundred men might take shelter. When the folk have
a mind to get camphor, they bore into the upper part of the bole with a
long iron, whereupon the liquid camphor, which is the sap of the tree,
floweth out and they catch it in vessels, where it concreteth like gum;
but after this the tree dieth and becometh firewood.

  Moreover, there is in this island a kind of wild beast, called
rhinoceros, that pastureth as do steers and buffaloes with us; but it is
a huge brute, bigger of body than the camel, and like it feedeth upon
the leaves and twigs of trees. It is a remarkable animal with a great
and thick horn, ten cubits long, a-middleward its head, wherein, when
cleft in twain, is the likeness of a man. Voyagers and pilgrims and
travelers declare that this beast called karkadan will carry off a great
elephant on its horn and graze about the island and the seacoast
therewith and take no heed of it till the elephant dieth and its fat,
melting in the sun, runneth down into the rhinoceros's eyes and blindeth
him, so that he lieth down on the shore. Then comes the bird roc and
carrieth off both the rhinoceros and that which is on its horn, to feed
its young withal. Moreover, I saw in this island many kinds of oxen and
buffaloes, whose like are not found in our country.

  Here I sold some of the diamonds which I had by me for gold dinars and
silver dirhams and bartered others for the produce of the country, and
loading them upon beasts of burden, fared on with the merchants from
valley to valley and town to town, buying and selling and viewing
foreign countries and the works and creatures of Allah till we came to
Bassorah city, where we abode a few days, after which I continued my
journey to Baghdad. I arrived at home with great store of diamonds and
money and goods, and forgathered with my friends and relations and gave
alms and largess and bestowed curious gifts and made presents to all my
friends and companions. Then I betook myself to eating well and drinking
well and wearing fine clothes and making merry with my fellows, and
forgot all my sufferings in the pleasures of return to the solace and
delight of life, with light heart and broadened breast. And everyone who
heard of my return came and questioned me of my adventures and of
foreign countries, and I related to them all that had befallen me, and
the much I had suffered, whereat they wondered and gave me joy of my
safe return.

  This, then, is the end of the story of my second voyage, and tomorrow,
Inshallah! I will tell you what befell me in my third voyage. The
company marveled at his story and supped with him, after which he
ordered a hundred dinars of gold to be given to the porter, who took the
sum with many thanks and blessings (which he stinted not even when he
reached home) and went his way, wondering at what he had heard. Next
morning as soon as day came in its sheen and shone, he rose and, praying
the dawn prayer, repaired to the house of Sindbad the Seaman, even as he
had bidden him, and went in and gave him good morrow. The merchant
welcomed him and made him sit with him till the rest of the company
arrived, and when they had well eaten and drunken and were merry with
joy and jollity, their host began by saying: Hearken, O my brothers, to
what I am about to tell you, for it is even more wondrous than what you
have already heard. But Allah alone kenneth what things His Omniscience
concealed from man! And listen to
