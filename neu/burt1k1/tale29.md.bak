# STORY OF THE LARRIKIN AND THE COOK

  ONE of the ne'er do-wells found himself one fine morning without
aught, and the world was straitened upon him and patience failed him. So
he lay down to sleep, and ceased not slumbering till the sun stang him
and the foam came out upon his mouth, whereupon he arose, and he was
penniless and had not even so much as a single dirham. Presently he
arrived at the shop of a cook, who had set his pots and pans over the
fire and washed his saucers and wiped his scales and swept his shop and
sprinkled it. And indeed his fats and oils were clear and clarified and
his spices fragrant, and he himself stood behind his cooking pots ready
to serve customers. So the larrikin, whose wits had been sharpened by
hunger, went in to him and saluting him, said to him, "Weigh me half a
dirham's worth of meat and a quarter of a dirham's worth of boiled
grain, and the like of bread." So the kitchener weighed it out to him
and the good-for-naught entered the shop, whereupon the man set the food
before him and he ate till he had gobbled up the whole and licked the
saucers and sat perplexed, knowing not how he should do with the cook
concerning the price of that he had eaten, and turning his eyes about
upon everything in the shop.

  And as he looked, behold, he caught sight of an earthen pan lying
arsy-versy upon its mouth, so he raised it from the ground and found
under it a horse's tail, freshly cut off and the blood oozing from it,
whereby he knew that the cook adulterated his meat with horseflesh. When
he discovered this default, he rejoiced therein, and washing his hands,
bowed his head and went out. And when the kitchener saw that he went and
gave him naught, he cried out, saying, "Stay, O pest, O burglar!" So the
larrikin stopped and said to him, "Dost thou cry out upon me and call to
me with these words, O comute?" Whereat the cook was angry, and coming
down from the shop, cried: "What meanest thou by thy speech, O low
fellow, thou that devourest meat and millet and bread and kitchen and
goest forth with 'the peace be on thee!' as it were the thing had not
been and down naught for it?" Quoth the lackpenny, "Thou liest, O
accursed son of a cuckold!" Whereupon the cook cried out, and laying
hold of his debtor's collar, said, "O Moslems, this fellow is my first
customer this day, and he hath eaten my food and given me naught."

  So the folk gathered about them and blamed the ne'er-do-well and said
to him, "Give him the price of that which thou hast eaten." Quoth he, "I
gave him a dirham before I entered the shop," and quoth the cook: "Be
everything I sell this day forbidden to me, if he gave me so much as the
name of a coin! By Allah, he gave me naught, but ate my food and went
out and would have made off, without aught said." Answered the larrikin,
"I gave thee a dirham," and he reviled the kitchener, who returned his
abuse, whereupon he dealt him a buffet and they gripped and grappled and
throttled each other. When the folk saw them fighting, they came up to
them and asked them, "What is this strife between you, and no cause for
it?" and the lackpenny answered, "Ay, by Allah, but there is a cause for
it, and the cause hath a tail!" Whereupon cried the cook: "Yea, by
Allah, now thou mindest me of thyself and thy dirham! Yes, he gave me a
dirham, and but a quarter of the coin is spent. Come back and take the
rest of the price of thy dirham." For he understood what was to do, at
the mention of the tail.

  "And I, O my brother," added Abu al-Hasan, "my story hath a cause,
which I will tell thee." The Caliph laughed at his speech and said: "By
Allah, this is none other than a pleasant tale! Tell me thy story and
the cause."

  Replied the host: "With love and goodly gree! Know, O my lord, that my
name is Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a and that my father died and left me
abundant wealth, of which I made two parts. One I laid up, and with the
other I betook myself to enjoying the pleasures of friendship and
conviviality and consorting with intimates and boon companions and the
sons of the merchants, nor did I leave one but I caroused with him and
he with me. And I lavished all my money on comrades and good cheer, till
there remained with me naught. Whereupon I betook myself to the friends
and fellow topers upon whom I wasted my wealth, so perhaps they might
provide for my case, but when I visited them and went round about to
them all, I found no vantage in one of them, nor would any so much as
break a bittock of bread in my face. So I wept for myself, and repairing
to my mother, complained to her of my case. Quoth she: 'Such are
friends. An thou have aught, they frequent thee and devour thee, but an
thou have naught, they cast thee off and chase thee away.' Then I
brought out the other half of my money and bound myself by an oath that
I would never more entertain any save one single night, after which I
would never again salute him nor notice him. Hence my saying to thee:
'Far be it, alas! that what is past should again come to pass, for I
will never again company with thee after this night."'

  When the Commander of the Faithful heard this, he laughed a loud laugh
and said: "By Allah, O my brother, thou art indeed excused in this
matter, now that I know the cause and that the cause hath a tail.
Nevertheless, Inshallah, I will not sever myself from thee." Replied Abu
al-Hasan: "O my guest, did I not say to thee, 'Far be it, alas! that
what is past should again come to pass?' For indeed I will never again
forgather with any!" Then the Caliph rose and the host set before him a
dish of roast goose and a bannock of first bread, and sitting down, fell
to cutting off morsels and morseling the Caliph therewith. They gave not
over eating till they were filled, when Abu al-Hasan brought basin and
ewer and potash and they washed their hands. Then he lighted three wax
candles and three lamps, and spreading the drinking cloth, brought
strained wine, clear, old, and fragrant, whose scent was as that of
virgin musk. He filled the first cup and saying, "O my boon companion,
be ceremony laid aside between us by thy leave! Thy slave is by thee,
may I not be afflicted with thy loss!" drank if off and filled a second
cup, which he handed to the Caliph with due reverence.

  His fashion pleased the Commander of the Faithful, and the goodliness
of his speech, and he said to himself, "By Allah, I will assuredly
requite him for this!" Then Abu al-Hasan filled the cup again and handed
it to the Cahph, reciting these two couplets:

  "Had we thy coming known, we would for sacrifice  
  Have poured thee out heart's blood or blackness of the eyes.  
  Ay, and we would have spread our bosoms in thy way,  
  That so thy feet might fare on eyelids, carpet-wise."  

When the Caliph heard his verses, he took the cup from his hand and
kissed it and drank it off and returned it to Abu al-Hasan, who made him
an obeisance and filled and drank. Then he filled again, and kissing the
cup thrice, recited these lines:

      "Your presence honoreth the base,  
      And we confess the deed of grace.  
      An you absent yourself from us,  
      No freke we find to fill your place."  

  Then he gave the cup to the Caliph, saying: "Drink it in health and
soundness! It doeth away malady and bringeth remedy and setteth the
runnels of health to flow free." So they ceased not carousing and
conversing till middle night, when the Caliph said to his host, "O my
brother, hast thou in thy heart a concupiscence thou wouldst have
accomplished, or a contingency thou wouldst avert?" Said he: "By Allah,
there is no regret in my heart save that I am not empowered with bidding
and forbidding, so I might manage what is in my mind!" Quoth the
Commander of the Faithful, "By Allah, and again by Allah, O my brother,
tell me what is in thy mind!" And quoth Abu al-Hasan: "Would Heaven I
might be Caliph for one day and avenge myself on my neighbors, for that
in my vicinity is a mosque, and therein four sheikhs, who hold it a
grievance when there cometh a guest to me, and they trouble me with talk
and worry me in words and menace me that they will complain of me to the
Prince of True Believers, and indeed they oppress me exceedingly. And I
crave of Allah the Most High power for one day, that I may beat each and
every of them with four hundred lashes, as well as the imam of the
mosque, and parade them round about the city of Baghdad and bid cry
before them: 'This is the reward and the least of the reward of whoso
exceedeth in talk and vexeth the folk and turneth their joy to annoy.'
This is what I wish, and no more."

  Said the Caliph: "Allah grant thee that thou seekest! Let us crack one
last cup and rise ere the dawn draw near, and, tomorrow night I will be
with thee again." Said Abu al-Hasan, "Far be it!" Then the Caliph
crowned a cup, and putting therein a piece of Cretan bhang, gave it to
his host and said to him, "My life on thee, O my brother, drink this cup
from my hand!" and Abu al-Hasan answered, "Ay, by thy life, I will drink
it from thy hand." So he took it and drank it off, but hardly had it
settled in his stomach when his head forewent his heels and he fell to
the ground like one slain. Whereupon the Caliph went out and said to his
slave Masrur: "Go in to yonder young man, the housemaster, and take him
up and bring him to me at the palace. And when thou goest out, shut the
door." So saying, he went away, whilst Masrur entered, and taking up Abu
al-Hasan, shut the door behind him, and made after his master till he
reached with him the palace what while the night drew to an end and the
cocks began crowing, and set him down before the Commander of the
Faithful, who laughed at him.

  Then he sent for Ja'afar the Barmecide and when he came before him,
said to him, "Note thou yonder young man," pointing to Abu al-Hasan,
"and when thou shalt see him tomorrow seated in my place of estate and
on the throne of my caliphate and clad in my royal clothing, stand thou
in attendance upon him, and enjoin the emirs and grandees and the folk
of my household and the officers of my realm to be upon their feet, as
in his service, and obey him in whatso he shall bid them do. And thou,
if he speak to thee of aught, do it, and hearken unto his say and
gainsay him not in anything during this coming day." Ja'afar
acknowledged the order with "Hearkening and obedience" and withdrew,
whilst the Prince of True Believers went in to the palace women, who
came up to him, and he said to them: "When this sleeper shall awake
tomorrow, kiss ye the ground between his hands, and do ye wait upon him
and gather round about him and clothe him in the royal clothing and
serve him with the service of the caliphate, and deny not aught of his
estate, but say to him, 'Thou art the Caliph."' Then he taught them what
they should say to him and how they should do with him, and withdrawing
to a retired room, let down a curtain before himself and slept.

  Thus fared it with the Caliph, but as regards Abu al-Hasan, he gave
not over snoring in his sleep till the day brake clear and the rising of
the sun drew near, when a woman in waiting came up to him and said to
him, "O our lord, the morning prayer!" Hearing these words, he laughed,
and opening his eyes, turned them about the palace and found himself in
an apartment whose walls were Painted with gold and lapis lazuli and its
ceiling dotted and starred with red gold. Around it were sleeping
chambers with curtains of gold-embroidered silk let down over their
doors, and all about vessels of gold and porcelain and crystal and
furniture and carpets dispread and lamps burning before the niche
wherein men prayed, and slave girls and eunuchs and Mamelukes and black
slaves and boys and pages and attendants.

  When he saw this, he was bewildered in his wit and said: "By Allah
either I am dreaming a dream, or this is Paradise and the Abode of
Peace!" And he shut his eyes and would have slept again. Quoth one of
the eunuchs, "O my lord, this is not of thy wont, O Commander of the
Faithful!" Then the rest of the handmaids of the palace came up to him
and lifted him into a sitting posture, when he found himself upon a
mattress raised a cubit's height from the ground and all stuffed with
floss silk. So they seated him upon it and propped his elbow with a
pillow, and he looked at the apartment and its vastness and saw those
eunuchs and slave girls in attendance upon him and standing about his
head, whereupon he laughed at himself and said, "By Allah, 'tis not as I
were on wake, yet I am not asleep!" And in his perplexity he bowed his
chin upon his bosom, and then opened his eyes, little by little,
smiling, and saying, "What is this state wherein I find myself?" Then he
arose and sat up, whilst the damsels laughed at him privily, and he was
bewildered in his wit, and bit his finger, and as the bite pained him,
he cried "Oh!" and was vexed. And the Caliph watched him whence he saw
him not, and laughed.

  Presently Abu al-Hasan turned to a damsel and called to her, whereupon
she answered, "At thy service, O Prince of True Believers!" Quoth he,
"What is thy name?" and quoth she, "Shajarat al-Durr." Then he said to
her, "By the protection of Allah, O damsel, am I Commander of the
Faithful?" She replied, "Yes, indeed, by the protection of Allah thou in
this time art Commander of the Faithful." Quoth he, "By Allah, thou
liest, O thousandfold whore!" Then he glanced at the chief eunuch and
called to him, whereupon he came to him and kissing the ground before
him, said, "Yes, O Commander of the Faithful." Asked Abu al-Hasan, "Who
is Commander of the Faithful?" and the eunuch answered "Thou." And Abu
al-Hasan said, "Thou Hest, thousandfold he-whore that thou art!" Then he
turned to another eunuch and said to him, "O my chief, by the protection
of Allah, am I Prince of the True Believers?" Said he: "Ay, by Allah, O
my lord, thou art in this time Commander of the Faithful and Viceregent
of the Lord of the Three Worlds."

  Abu al-Hasan laughed at himself and doubted of his reason and was
bewildered at what he beheld, and said: "In one night do I become
Caliph? Yesterday I was Abu al-Hasan the Wag, and today I am Commander
of the Faithful." Then the Chief Eunuch came up to him and said: "O
Prince of True Believers (the name of Allah encompass thee!), thou art
indeed Commander of the Faithful and Viceregent of the Lord of the Three
Worlds!" And the slave girls and eunuchs flocked round about him, till
he arose and abode wondering at his case. Hereupon the eunuch brought
him a pair of sandals wrought with raw silk and green silk and purfled
with red gold, and he took them and after examining them, set them in
his sleeve. Whereat the castrato cried out and said: "Allah! Allah! O my
lord, these are sandals for the treading of thy feet, so thou mayst wend
to the wardrobe." Abu al-Hasan was confounded, and shaking the sandals
from his sleeve, put them on his feet, whilst the Caliph died of
laughter at him. The slave forewent him to the chapel of ease, where he
entered, and doing his job, came out into the chamber, whereupon the
slave girls brought him a basin of gold and a ewer of silver and poured
water on his hands, and he made the wuzu ablution. Then they spread him
a prayer carpet and he prayed.

  Now he knew not how to pray, and gave not over bowing and prostrating
for twenty inclinations, pondering in himself the while and saying: "By
Allah, I am none other than the Commander of the Faithful in very truth!
This is assuredly no dream, for all these things happen not in a dream."
And he was convinced and determined in himself that he was Prince of
True Believers, so he pronounced the salaam and finished his prayers,
whereupon the Mamelukes and slave girls came round about him with
bundled suits of silken and linen stuffs and clad him in the costume of
the caliphate and gave the royal dagger in his hand.

  Then the chief eunuch came in and said, "O Prince of True Believers,
the Chamberlain is at the door craving permission to enter." Said he,
"Let him enter!" whereupon he came in, and after kissing ground, offered
the salutation, "Peace be upon thee, O Commander of the Faithful!" At
this Abu al-Hasan rose and descended from the couch to the floor,
whereupon the official exclaimed: "Allah! Allah! O Prince of True
Believers, wottest thou not that all men are thy lieges and under thy
rule and that it is not meet for the Caliph to rise to any man?"
Presently the eunuch went out before him, and the little white slaves
behind him, and they ceased not going till they raised the curtain and
brought him into the hall of judgment and the throne room of the
caliphate. There he saw all curtains and the forty doors and Al-'Ijli
and Al-Rakashi the poet, and 'Ibdan and Jadim and Abu Ishak the cup
companion, and beheld swords drawn and the lions compassing the throne
as the white of the eye encircleth the black, and gilded glaives and
death-dealing bows and Ajams and Arabs and Turks and Daylamites and folk
and peoples and emirs and wazirs and captains and grandees and lords of
the land and men of war in band, and in very sooth there appeared the
might of the House of Abbas and the majesty of the Prophet's family.

  So he sat down upon the throne of the caliphate and set the dagger on
his lap, whereupon all present came up to kiss ground between his hands
and called down on him length of life and continuance of weal. Then came
forward Ja'afar the Barmecide and, kissing the ground, said: "Be the
wide world of Allah the treading of thy feet, and may Paradise be thy
dwelling place and the fire the home of thy foes! Never may neighbor
defy thee, nor the lights of fire die out for thee, O Caliph of all
cities and ruler of all countries!" Therewithal Abu al-Hasan cried out
at him and said, "O dog of the sons of Barmak, go down forthright, thou
and the chief of the city police, to such a place in such a street, and
deliver a hundred dinars of gold to the mother of Abu al-Hasan the Wag,
and bear her my salutation. Then go to such a mosque and take the four
Sheikhs and the imam and scourge each of them with a thousand lashes and
mount them on beasts, face to tail, and parade them round about all the
city and banish them to a place other than this city. And bid the crier
make cry before them, saying: 'This is the reward and the least of the
reward of whoso multiplieth words and molesteth his neighbors and
damageth their delights and stinteth their eating and drinking!'"

  Ja'afar received the command and answered "With obedience," after
which he went down from before Abu al-Hasan to the city and did all he
had ordered him to do. Meanwhile, Abu al-Hasan abode in the caliphate,
taking and giving, bidding and forbidding and carrying out his command
till the end of the day, when he gave leave and permission to withdraw,
and the emirs and officers of state departed to their several
occupations and he looked toward the Chamberlain and the rest of the
attendants and said, "Begone!" Then the eunuchs came to him, and calling
down on him length of life and continuance of weal, walked in attendance
upon him and raised the curtain, and he entered the pavilion of the
harem, where he found candles lighted and lamps burning and singing
women smiting on instruments, and ten slave girls, high-bosomed maids.
When he saw this, he was confounded in his wit and said to himself, "By
Allah, I am in truth Commander of the Faithful!" presently adding: "Or
haply these are of the Jann, and he who was my guest yesternight was one
of their kings who saw no way to requite my favors save by commanding
his Ifrits to address me as Prince of True Believers. But an these be of
the Jann, may Allah deliver me in safety from their mischief!"

  As soon as he appeared, the slave girls rose to him, and carrying him
up on to the dais, brought him a great tray bespread with the richest
viands. So he ate thereof with all his might and main, till he had
gotten his fill, when he called one of the handmaids and said to her,
"What is thy name?" Replied she, "My name is Miskah," and he said to
another, "What is thy name?" Quoth she, "My name is Tarkah." Then he
asked a third, "What is thy name?" who answered, "My name is Tohfah."
And he went on to question the damsels of their names, one after other,
till he had learned the ten, when he rose from that place and removed to
the wine chamber. He found it every way complete, and saw therein ten
great trays, covered with all fruits and cates and every sort of
sweetmeats. So he sat down and ate thereof after the measure of his
competency, and finding there three troops of singing girls, was amazed,
and made the girls eat.

  Then he sat and the singers also seated themselves, whilst the black
slaves and the white slaves and the eunuchs and pages and boys stood,
and of the slave girls some sat and others stood. The damsels sang and
warbled all varieties of melodies and the place rang with the sweetness
of the songs, whilst the pipes cried out and the lutes with them wailed,
till it seemed to Abu al-Hasan that he was in Paradise, and his heart
was heartened and his breast broadened. So he sported, and joyaunce grew
on him and he bestowed robes of honor on the damsels and gave and
bestowed, challenging this girl and kissing that and toying with a
third, plying one with wine and morseling another with meat, till
nightfall.

  All this while the Commander of the Faithful was diverting himself
with watching him and laughing, and when night fell he bade one of the
slave girls drop a piece of bhang in the cup and give it to Abu al-Hasan
to drink. So she did his bidding and gave him the cup, which no sooner
had he drunk than his head forewent his feet. Therewith the Caliph came
forth from behind the curtain laughing, and calling to the attendant who
had brought Abu al-Hasan to the palace, said to him, "Carry this man to
his own place." So Masrur took him up, and carrying him to his own
house, set him down in the saloon. Then he went forth from him, and
shutting the saloon door upon him, returned to the Caliph, who slept
till the morrow.

  As for Abu al-Hasan, he gave not over slumbering till Almighty Allah
brought on the morning, when he recovered from the drug and awoke,
crying out and saying: "Ho, Tuffahah! Ho, Rahat al-Kulub! Ho, Miskah!
Ho, Tohfah!" And he ceased not calling upon the palace handmaids till
his mother heard him summoning strange damsels, and rising, came to him
and said: "Allah's name encompass thee! Up with thee, O my son, O Abu
al-Hasan! Thou dreamest." So he opened his eyes, and finding an old
woman at his head, raised his eyes and said to her, "Who art thou?"
Quoth she, "I am thy mother," and quoth he: "Thou liest! I am the
Commander of the Faithful the Viceregent of Allah." Whereupon his mother
shrieked aloud and said to him: "Heaven preserve thy reason! Be silent,
O my son, and cause not the loss of our lives and the wasting of thy
wealth, which will assuredly befall us if any hear this talk and carry
it to the Caliph."

  So he rose from his sleep, and finding himself in his own saloon and
his mother by him, had doubts of his wit, and said to her: "By Allah, O
my mother, I saw myself in a dream in a palace, with slave girls and
Mamelukes about me and in attendance upon me, and I sat upon the throne
of the Caliphate and ruled. By Allah, O my mother, this is what I saw,
and in very sooth it was no dream!" Then he bethought himself awhile and
said: "Assuredly, I am Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, and this that I saw was
only a dream when I was made Caliph and bade and forbade." Then he
bethought himself again and said: "Nay, but 'twas not a dream, and I am
none other than the Caliph, and indeed I gave gifts and bestowed honor
robes." Quoth his mother to him: "O my son, thou sportest with thy
reason. Thou wilt go to the madhouse and become a gazingstock. Indeed,
that which thou hast seen is only from the Foul Fiend, and it was an
imbroglio of dreams, for at times Satan sporteth with men's wits in all
manner of ways."

  Then said she to him, "O my son, was there anyone with thee
yesternight?" And he reflected and said: "Yes, one lay the night with me
and I acquainted him with my case and told him my tale. Doubtless, he
was of the devils, and I, O my mother, even as thou sayst truly, am Abu
al-Hasan al-Khali'a." She rejoined: "O my son, rejoice in tidings of all
good, for yesterday's record is that there came the Wazir Ja'afar the
Barmecide and his many, and beat the Sheikhs of the mosque and the imam,
each a thousand lashes, after which they paraded them round about the
city, making proclamation before them and saying, 'This is the reward
and the least of the reward of whoso faileth in goodwill to his
neighbors and troubleth on them their lives!' And he banished them from
Baghdad. Moreover, the Caliph sent me a hundred dinars and sent to
salute me."

  Whereupon Abu al-Hasan cried out and said to her: "O ill-omened crone,
wilt thou contradict me and tell me that I am not the Prince of True
Believers? 'Twas I who commanded Ja'afar the Barmecide to beat the
Sheikhs and parade them about the city and make proclamation before
them, and 'twas I, very I, who sent thee the hundred dinars and sent to
salute thee, and I, O beldam of ill luck, am in very deed the Commander
of the Faithful, and thou art a liar, who would make me out an idiot."
So saying, he rose up and fell upon her and beat her with a staff of
almond wood, till she cried out "Help, O Moslems!" And he increased the
beating upon her till the folk heard her cries, and coming to her, found
Abu al-Hasan bashing his mother and saying to her: "Old woman of ill
omen, am I not the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast ensorceled me!"
When the folk heard his words, they said, "This man raveth," and doubted
not of his madness.

  So they came in upon him, and seizing him, pinioned his elbows, and
bore him to the bedlam. Quoth the superintendant, "What aileth this
youth?" and quoth they, "This is a madman, afflicted of the Jinn." "By
Allah," cried Abu al-Hasan, "they lie against me! I am no madman, but
the Commander of the Faithful." And the superintendent answered him,
saying, "None lieth but thou, O foulest of the Jinn-maddened!" Then he
stripped him of his clothes, and clapping on his neck a heavy chain,
bound him to a high lattice and fell to beating him two bouts a day and
two a-nights, and he ceased not abiding on this wise the space of ten
days. Then his mother came to him and said: "O my son, O Abu al-Hasan,
return to thy right reason, for this is the Devil's doing." Quoth he:
"Thou sayest sooth, O my mother, and bear thou witness of me that I
repeat me of that talk and turn me from my madness. So do thou deliver
me, for I am nigh upon death." Accordingly his mother went out to the
superintendent and procured his release, and he returned to his own
house.

  Now this was at the beginning of the month, and when it ended, Abu
al-Hasan longed to drink liquor and, returning to his former habit,
furnished his saloon and made ready food and bade bring wine. Then,
going forth to the bridge, he sat there, expecting one whom he should
converse and carouse with, according to his custom. As he sat thus,
behold, up came the Caliph and Masrur to him, but Abu al-Hasan saluted
them not and said to Al-Rashid, "No friendly welcome to thee, O King of
the Jann!" Quoth Al-Rashid, "What have I done to thee?" and quoth Abu
al-Hasan, "What more couldst thou do than what thou hast done to me, O
foulest of the Jann? I have been beaten and thrown into bedlam, where
all said I was Jinn-mad, and this was caused by none save thyself. I
brought thee to my house and fed thee with my best, after which thou
dist empower thy Satans and Marids to disport themselves with my wits
from morning to evening. So avaunt and aroynt thee and wend thy ways!"

  The Caliph smiled and, seating himself by his side, said to him, "O my
brother, did I not tell thee that I would return to thee?" Quoth Abu
al-Hasan, "I have no need of thee, and as the byword sayeth in verse:

  "Fro' my friend, 'twere meeter and wiser to part,  
  For what eye sees not born shall ne'er sorrow heart."  

And indeed, O my brother, the night thou camest to me and we conversed
and caroused together, I and thou, 'twas as if the Devil came to me and
troubled me that night." Asked the Caliph, "And who is he, the Devil?"
and answered Abu al-Hasan, "He is none other than thou." Whereat the
Caliph laughed and coaxed him and spake him fair, saying: "O my brother,
when I went out from thee, I forgot the door and left it open, and
perhaps Satan came in to thee." Quoth Abu al-Hasan: "Ask me not of that
which hath betided me. What possessed thee to leave the door open, so
that the Devil came in to me and there befell me with him this and
that?" And he related to him all that had betided him, first and last
(and in repetition is no fruition), what while the Caliph laughed and
hid his laughter.

  Then said he to Abu al-Hasan: "Praised be Allah who hath done away
from thee whatso irked thee, and that I see thee once more in weal!" And
Abu al-Hasan said: "Never again will I take thee to cup companion or
sitting comrade, for the proverb saith, 'Whoso stumbleth on a stone and
thereto returneth, upon him be blame and reproach.' And thou, O my
brother, nevermore will I entertain thee nor company with thee, for that
I have not found thy heel propitious to me." But the Caliph coaxed him
and said, "I have been the means of thy winning to thy wish anent the
imam and the Sheikhs." Abu al-Hasan replied, "Thou hast," and Al-Rashid
continued, "And haply somewhat may betide which shall gladden thy heart
yet more." Abu al-Hasan asked, "What dost thou require of me?" and the
Commander of the Faithful answered: "Verily, I am thy guest. Reject not
the guest." Quoth Abu al-Hasan: "On condition that thou swear to me by
the characts on the seal of Solomon, David's son (on the twain be the
peace!) that thou wilt not suffer thine Ifrits to make fun of me." He
replied, "To hear is to obey!"

  Whereupon the wag took him and brought him into the saloon and set
food before him and entreated him with friendly speech. Then he told him
all that had befallen him, whilst the Caliph was like to die of stifled
laughter. After which Abu al-Hasan removed the tray of food, and
bringing the wine service, filled a cup and cracked it three times, then
gave it to the Caliph, saying: "O boon companion mine, I am thy slave,
and let not that which I am about to say offend thee, and be thou not
vexed, neither do thou vex me." And he recited these verses:

   "Hear one that wills thee well! Lips none shall bless  
   Save those who drink for drunk and all transgress.  
   Ne'er will I cease to swill while night falls dark  
   Till lout my forehead low upon my tass.  
   In wine like liquid sun is my delight  
   Which clears all care and gladdens allegresse."  

  When the Caliph heard these his verses and saw how apt he was at
couplets, he was delighted with exceeding delight, and taking the cup,
drank it off, and the twain ceased not to converse and carouse till the
wine rose to their heads. Then quoth Abu al-Hasan to the Caliph: "O boon
companion mine, of a truth I am perplexed concerning my affair, for
meseemed I was Commander of the Faithful and ruled and gave gifts and
largess, and in very deed, O my brother, it was not a dream." Quoth the
Caliph, "These were the imbroglios of sleep," and crumbling a bit of
bhang into the cup, said to him, "By my life, do thou drink this cup,"
and said Abu al-Hasan, "Surely I will drink it from thy hand." Then he
took the cup and drank it off, and no sooner had it settled in his
stomach than his head fell to the ground before his feet. Now his
manners and fashions pleased the Caliph, and the excellence of his
composition and his frankness, and he said in himself, "I will assuredly
make him my cup companion and sitting comrade." So he rose forthright,
and saying to Masrur, "Take him up," returned to the palace.

  Accordingly, the eunuch took up Abu al-Hasan, and carrying him to the
palace of the caliphate, set him down before Al-Rashid, who bade the
slaves and slave girls compass him about, whilst he himself hid in a
place where Abu al-Hasan could not see him. Then he commanded one of the
handmaidens to take the lute and strike it over the wag's head, whilst
the rest smote upon their instruments. So they played and sang, till Abu
al-Hasan awoke at the last of the night and heard the symphony of lutes
and tambourines and the sound of the flutes and the singing of the slave
girls, whereupon he opened eyes, and finding himself in the palace, with
the handmaids and eunuchs about him, exclaimed: "There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Come to my
help this night, which meseems more unlucky than the former! Verily, I
am fearful of the madhouse and of that which I suffered therein the
first time, and I doubt not but the Devil is come to me again, as
before. O Allah, my Lord, put thou Satan to shame!" Then he shut his
eyes and laid his head in his sleeve, and fell to laughing softly and
raising his head betimes, but still found the apartment lighted and the
girls singing.

  Presently one of the eunuchs sat down at his head and said to him,
"Sit up, O Prince of True Believers, and look on thy palace and thy
slave girls." Said Abu al-Hasan: "Under the veil of Allah, am I in truth
Commander of the Faithful, and dost thou not lie? Yesterday I rode not
forth, neither ruled, but drank and slept, and this eunuch cometh to
make me rise." Then he sat up and recalled to thought that which had
betided him with his mother and how he had beaten her and entered the
bedlam, and he saw the marks of the beating wherewith the superintendant
had beaten him, and was perplexed concerning his affair and pondered in
himself, saying, "By Allah, I know not how my case is nor what is this
that betideth me!" Then, gazing at the scene around him, he said
privily, "All these are of the Jann in human shape, and I commit my case
to Allah."

  Presently he turned to one of the damsels and said to her, "Who am I?"
Quoth she, "Thou art the Commander of the Faithful," and quoth he: "Thou
liest, O calamity! If I be indeed the Commander of the Faithful, bite my
finger." So she came to him and bit it with all her might, and he said
to her, "It doth suffice." Then he asked the chief eunuch, "Who am I?"
and he answered, "Thou art the Commander of the Faithful." So he left
him and returned to his wonderment. Then, turning to a little white
slave, said to him, "Bite my ear," and he bent his head low down to him
and put his ear to his mouth. Now the Mameluke was young and lacked
sense, so he closed his teeth upon Abu al-Hasan's ear with all his
might, till he came near to sever it. And he knew not Arabic, so as
often as the wag said to him, "It doth suffice," he concluded that he
said, "Bite like a vice," and redoubled his bite and made his teeth meet
in the ear, whilst the damsels were diverted from him with hearkening to
the singing girls, and Abu al-Hasan cried out for succor from the boy
and the Caliph lost his senses for laughter.

  Then he dealt the boy a cuff, and he let go his ear, whereupon all
present fell down with laughter and said to the little Mameluke, "Art
mad that thou bitest the Caliph's ear on this wise?" And Abu al-Hasan
cried to them: "Sufficeth ye not, O ye wretched Jinns, that which hath
befallen me? But the fault is not yours. The fault is of your chief, who
transmewed you from Jinn shape to mortal shape. I seek refuge against
you this night by the Throne Verse and the Chapter of Sincerity and the
Two Preventives!" So saying, the wag put off his clothes till he was
naked, with prickle and breech exposed, and danced among the slave
girls. They bound his hands and he wantoned among them, while they died
of laughing at him and the Caliph swooned away for excess of laughter.

  Then he came to himself, and going forth the curtain to Abu al-Hasan,
said to him: "Out on thee, O Abu al-Hasan! Thou slayest me with
laughter." So he turned to him, and knowing him, said to him, "By Allah,
'tis thou slayest me and slayest my mother and slewest the Sheikhs and
the imam of the mosque!" After which he kissed ground before him and
prayed for the permanence of his prosperity and the endurance of his
days. The Caliph at once robed him in a rich robe and gave him a
thousand dinars, and presently he took the wag into especial favor and
married him and bestowed largess on him and lodged him with himself in
the palace and made him of the chief of his cup companions, and indeed
he was preferred with him above them, and the Caliph advanced him over
them all, so that he sat with him and the Lady Zubaydah bint al-Kasim,
whose treasuress, Nuzhat al-Fuad hight, was given to him in marriage.

  After this Abu al-Hasan the wag abode with his wife in eating and
drinking and all delight of life, till whatso was with them went the way
of money, when he said to her, "Harkye, O Nuzhat al-Fuad!" Said she, "At
thy service," and he continued, "I have it in mind to play a trick on
the Caliph, and thou shalt do the like with the Lady Zubaydah, and we
will take of them at once, to begin with, two hundred dinars and two
pieces of silk." She rejoined, "As thou willest, but what thinkest thou
to do?" And he said: "We will feign ourselves dead, and this is the
trick. I will die before thee and lay myself out, and do thou spread
over me a silken napkin and loose my turban over me and tie my toes and
lay on my stomach a knife and a little salt. Then let down thy hair and
betake thyself to thy mistress Zubaydah, tearing thy dress and slapping
thy face and crying out. She will ask thee, 'What aileth thee?' and do
thou answer her, 'May thy head outlive Abu al-Hasan the wag, for he is
dead.' She will mourn for me and weep and bid her new treasuress give
thee a hundred dinars and a piece of silk and will say to thee, 'Go, lay
him out and carry him forth.' So do thou take of her the hundred dinars
and the piece of silk and come back, and when thou returnest to me, I
will rise up and thou shalt lie down in my place, and I will go to the
Caliph and say to him, 'May thy head outlive Nuzhat al-Fuad,' and rend
my raiment and pluck out my beard. He will mourn for thee and say to his
treasurer, 'Give Abu al-Hasan a hundred dinars and a piece of silk.'
Then he will say to me, 'Go, lay her out and carry her forth,' and I
will come back to thee."

  Therewith Nuzhat al-Fuad rejoiced and said, "Indeed, this is an
excellent device." Then Abu al-Hasan stretched himself out forthright
and she shut his eyes and tied his feet and covered him with the napkin
and did whatso her lord had bidden her. After which she tare her gear
and bared her head and letting down her hair, went in to the Lady
Zubaydah, crying out and weeping. When the Princess saw her in this
state, she cried: "What plight is this? What is thy story, and what
maketh thee weep?" And Nuzhatal-Fuad answered, weeping and loud-wailing
the while: "O my lady, may thy head live and mayst thou survive Abu
al-Hasan al-Khali'a, for he is dead!" The Lady Zubaydah mourned for him
and said, "Alas, poor Abu al-Hasan the wag!" and she shed tears for him
awhile. Then she bade her treasuress give Nuzhat al-Fuad a hundred
dinars and a piece of silk and said to her, "O Nuzhat al-Fuad, go, lay
him out and carry him forth."

  So she took the hundred dinars and the piece of silk and returned to
her dwelling, rejoicing, and went in to her spouse and acquainted him
what had befallen, whereupon he arose and rejoiced and girdled his
middle and danced and took the hundred dinars and the piece of silk and
laid them up. Then he laid out Nuzhat al-Fuad and did with her as she
had done with him, after which he rent his raiment and plucked out his
beard and disordered his turban and ran out, nor ceased running till he
came in to the Caliph, who was sitting in the judgment hall, and he in
this plight, beating his breast. The Caliph asked him, "What aileth
thee, O Abu al-Hasan?" and he wept and answered, "Would Heaven thy cup
companion had never been, and would his hour had never come!" Quoth the
Caliph, "Tell me thy case," and quoth Abu al-Hasan, "O my lord, may thy
head outlive Nuzhat al-Fuad!" The Caliph exclaimed, "There is no god but
God," and smote hand upon hand. Then he comforted Abu al-Hasan and said
to him, "Grieve not, for we will bestow upon thee a bedfellow other than
she." And he ordered the treasurer to give him a hundred dinars and a
piece of silk. Accordingly the treasurer did what the Caliph bade him,
and Al-Rashid said to him, "Go, lay her out and carry her forth and make
her a handsome funeral."

  So Abu al-Hasan took that which he had given him and returning to his
house, rejoicing, went in to Nuzhat al-Fuad and said to her, "Arise, for
our wish" is won." Hereat she arose and he laid before her the hundred
ducats and the piece of silk, whereat she rejoiced, and they added the
gold to the gold and the silk to the silk and sat talking and laughing
each to other.

  Meanwhile, when Abu al-Hasan fared forth the presence of the Caliph
and went to lay out Nuzhat al-Fuad, the Commander of the Faithful
mourned for her, and dismissing the Divan, arose and betook himself,
leaning upon Masrur, the Sworder of his vengeance, to the Lady Zubaydah,
that he might condole with her for her handmaid. He found her sitting
weeping and awaiting his coming, so she might condole with him for his
boon companion Abu al-Hasan the wag. So he said to her, "May thy head
outlive thy slave girl Nuzhat al-Fuad!" and said she: "O my lord, Allah
preserve my slave girl! Mayst thou live and long survive thy boon
companion Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, for he is dead." The Caliph smiled
and said to his eunuch: "O Masrur, verily women are little of wit. Allah
upon thee, say, was not Abu al-Hasan with me but now?" Quoth the Lady
Zubaydah, laughing from a heart full of wrath: "Wilt thou not leave thy
jesting? Sufficeth thee not that Abu al-Hasan is dead, but thou must put
to death my slave girl also and bereave us of the twain, and style me
little of wit?" The Caliph answered, "Indeed, 'tis Nuzhat al-Fuad who is
dead." And the Lady Zubaydah said: "Indeed he hath not been with thee,
nor hast thou seen him, and none was with me but now save Nuzhat
al-Fuad, and she sorrowful, weeping, with her clothes torn to tatters. I
exhorted her to patience and gave her a hundred dinars and a piece of
silk, and indeed I was awaiting thy coming, so I might console thee for
thy cup companion Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, and was about to send for
thee." The Caliph laughed and said, "None is dead save Nuzhat al-Fuad,"
and she, "No, no, good my lord; none is dead but Abu al-Hasan the wag."

  With this the Caliph waxed wroth, and the hashimi vein started out
from between his eyes and throbbed, and he cried out to Masrur and said
to him, "Fare thee forth to the house of Abu al-Hasan the wag, and see
which of them is dead." So Masrur went out, running, and the Caliph said
to the Lady Zubaydah, "Wilt thou lay me a wager?" And said she, "Yes, I
will wager, and I say that Abu al-Hasan is dead." Rejoined the Caliph:
"And I wager and say that none is dead save Nuzhat al-Fuad, and the
stake between me and thee shall be the Garden of Pleasaunce against thy
palace and the Pavilion of Pictures." So they agreed upon this and sat
awaiting Masrur's return with the news.

  As for the eunuch, he ceased not running till he came to the by-street
wherein was the stead of Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a. Now the wag was
comfortably seated and leaning back against the lattice, and chancing to
look round, saw Masrur running along the street and said to Nuzhat
al-Fuad, "Meseemeth the Caliph, when I went forth from him, dismissed
the Divan and went in to the Lady Zubaydah to condole with her,
whereupon she arose and condoled with him, saying, 'Allah increase thy
recompense for the loss of Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a!' And he said to her,
'None is dead save Nuzhat al-Fuad, may thy head outlive her!' Quoth she,
''Tis not she who is dead, but Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, thy boon
companion.' And quoth he, 'None is dead save Nuzhat al-Fuad.' And they
waxed so obstinate that the Caliph became wroth and they laid a wager,
and he hath sent Masrur the Sworder to see who is dead. Now, therefore,
'twere best that thou lie down, so he may sight thee and go and acquaint
the Caliph and confirm my saying."

  So Nuzhat al-Fuad stretched herself out and Abu al-Hasan covered her
with her mantilla and sat weeping at her head. Presently, Masrur, the
eunuch, suddenly came in to him and saluted him, and seeing Nuzhat
al-Fuad stretched out, uncovered her face and said: "There is no god but
God! Our sister Nuzhat al-Fuad is dead indeed. How sudden was the stroke
of Destiny! Allah have ruth on thee and acquit thee of all charge!" Then
he returned and related what had passed before the Caliph and the Lady
Zubaydah, and he laughing as he spoke. "O accursed one," cried the
Caliph: "this is no time for laughter! Tell us which is dead of them."
Masrur replied: "By Allah, O my lord, Abu al-Hasan is well, and none is
dead but Nuzhat al-Fuad." Quoth the Caliph to Zubaydah, "Thou hast lost
thy pavilion in thy play," and he jeered at her. and said, "O Masrur,
tell her what thou sawest."

  Quoth the eunuch: "Verily, O my lady, I ran without ceasing till I
came in to Abu al-Hasan in his house, and found Nuzhat al-Fuad lying
dead and Abu al-Hasan sitting tearful at her head. I saluted him and
condoled with him and sat down by his side and uncovered the face of
Nuzhat al-Fuad and saw her dead and her face swollen. So I said to him,
'Carry her out forthwith, so we may pray over her.' He replied, ''Tis
well,' and I left him to lay her out and came hither, that I might tell
you the news." The Prince of True Believers laughed and said, "Tell it
again and again to thy lady Little-wits." When the Lady Zubaydah heard
Masrur's words and those of the Caliph she was wroth and said, "None is
little of wit save he who believeth a black slave." And she abused
Masrur, whilst the Commander of the Faithful laughed; and the eunuch,
vexed at this, said to the Caliph, "He spake sooth who said, 'Women are
little of wits and lack religion."'

  Then said the Lady Zubaydah to the Caliph: "O Commander of the
Faithful, thou sportest and jestest with me, and this slave hoodwinketh
me, the better to please thee. But I will send and see which of them be
dead." And he answered, saying, "Send one who shall see which of them is
dead." So the Lady Zubaydah cried out to an old duenna, and said to her:
"Hie thee to the house of Nuzhat al-Fuad in haste and see who is dead,
and loiter not." And she used hard words to her. So the old woman went
out running, whilst the Prince of True Believers and Masrur laughed, and
she ceased not running till she came into the street. Abu al-Hasan saw
her, and knowing her, said to his wife: "O Nuzhat al-Fuad, meseemeth the
Lady Zubaydah hath sent to us to see who is dead and hath not given
credit to Masrur's report of thy death. Accordingly she hath dispatched
the old crone, her duenna, to discover the truth. So it behooveth me to
be dead in my turn for the sake of thy credit with the Lady Zubaydah."

  Hereat he lay down and stretched himself out, and she covered him and
bound his eyes and feet and sat in tears at his head. Presently the old
woman came in to her and saw her sitting at Abu al-Hasan's head, weeping
and recounting his fine qualities; and when she saw the old trot, she
cried out and said to her: "See what hath befallen me! Indeed Abu
al-Hasan is dead and hath left me lone and lorn!" Then she shrieked out
and rent her raiment and said to the crone, "O my mother, how very good
he was to me!" Quoth the other, "Indeed thou art excused, for thou wast
used to him and he to thee."

  Then she considered what Masrur had reported to the Caliph and the
Lady Zubaydah and said to her, "Indeed, Masrur goeth about to cast
discord between the Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah." Asked Nuzhat al-Fuad,
"And what is the cause of discord, O my mother?" and the other replied:
"O my daughter, Masrur came to the Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah and gave
them news of thee that thou wast dead and that Abu al-Hasan was well."
Nuzhat al-Fuad said to her: "O naunty mine, I was with my lady just now
and she gave me a hundred dinars and a piece of silk, and now see my
case and that which hath befallen me! Indeed I am bewildered, and how
shall I do, and I lone and lorn? Would Heaven I had died and he had
lived!" Then she wept and with her wept the old woman, who, going up to
Abu al-Hasan and uncovering his face, saw his eyes bound and swollen for
the swathing. So she covered him again and said, "Indeed, O Nuzhat
al-Fuad, thou art afflicted in Abu al-Hasan!"

  Then she condoled with her, and going out from her, ran along the
street till she came into the Lady Zubaydah and related to her the
story, and the Princess said to her, laughing: "Tell it over again to
the Caliph, who maketh me out little of wit, and lacking of religion,
and who made this ill-omened liar of a slave presume to contradict me."
Quoth Masrur, "This old woman lieth, for I saw Abu al-Hasan well and
Nuzhat al-Fuad it was who lay dead." Quoth the duenna, "'Tis thou that
liest, and wouldst fain cast discord-between the Caliph and the Lady
Zubaydah." And Masrur cried, "None lieth but thou, O old woman of ill
omen, and thy lady believeth thee, and she must be in her dotage."
Whereupon the Lady Zubaydah cried out at him, and in very sooth she was
enraged with him and with his speech and shed tears.

  Then said the Caliph to her: "I lie and my eunuch lieth, and thou
liest and thy waiting-woman lieth, so 'tis my rede we go, all four of us
together, that we may see which of us telleth the truth." Masrur said:
"Come, let us go, that I may do to this ill-omened old woman evil deeds
and deal her a sound drubbing for her lying." And the duenna answered
him: "O dotard, is thy wit like into my wit? Indeed thy wit is as the
hen's wit." Masrur was incensed at her words and would have laid violent
hands on her, but the Lady Zubaydah pushed him away from her and said to
him, "Her truthspeaking will presently be distinguished from thy
truth-speaking and her leasing from thy leasing." Then they all four
arose, laying wagers one with other, and went forth afoot from the
palace gate and hied on till they came in at the gate of the street
where Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a dwelt.

  He saw them, and said to his wife, Nuzhat al-Fuad: "Verily, all that
is sticky is not a pancake they cook, nor every time shall the crock
escape the shock. It seemeth the old woman hath gone and told her lady
and acquainted her with our case and she hath disputed with Masrur, the
eunuch, and they have laid wagers each with other about our death and
are come to us, all four, the Caliph and the eunuch and the Lady
Zubaydah and the old trot." When Nuzhat al-Fuad heard this, she started
up from her outstretched posture and asked, "How shall we do?" whereto
he answered, "We will both feign ourselves dead together and stretch
ourselves out and hold out breath." So she hearkened unto him and they
both lay down on the place where they usually slept the siesta and bound
their feet and shut their eyes and covered themselves with the veil and
held their breath.

  Presently up came the Caliph, Zubaydah, Masrur, and the old woman, and
entering, found Abu al-Hasan the wag and wife both stretched out as
dead, which when the Lady saw, she wept and said: "They ceased not to
bring ill news of my slave girl till she died. Methinketh Abu al-Hasan's
death was grievous to her and that she died after him." Quoth the
Caliph: "Thou shalt not prevent me with thy prattle and prate. She
certainly died before Abu al-Hasan, for he came to me with his raiment
rent and his beard plucked out, beating his breast with two bits of
unbaked brick, and I gave him a hundred dinars and a piece of silk and
said too him, 'Go, bear her forth, and I will give thee a bedfellow
other than she and handsomer, and she shall be instead of her.' But it
would appear that her death was no light matter to him and he died after
her, so it is I who have beaten thee and gotten thy stake." The Lady
Zubaydah answered him in words galore, and the dispute between them
waxed sore.

  At last the Caliph sat down at the heads of the pair and said: "By the
tomb of the Apostle of Allah (whom may He save and assain!) and the
sepulchers of my fathers and forefathers, whoso will tell me which of
them died before the other, I will willingly give him a thousand
dinars!" When Abu al-Hasan heard the Caliph's words, he sprang up in
haste and said: "I died first, O Commander of the Faithful! Here with
the thousand dinars, and acquit thee of thine oath and the swear thou
sworest." Nuzhat al-Fuad rose also and stood up before the Caliph and
the Lady Zubaydah, who both rejoiced in this and in their safety, and
the Princess chid her slave girl. Then the Caliph and Zubaydah gave them
joy of their well-being and knew that this death was a trick to get the
gold, and the Lady said to Nuzhat al-Fuad: "Thou shouldst have sought of
me that which thou neededst, without this fashion, and not have burned
my heart for thee." And she, "Verily, I was ashamed, O my lady."

  As for the Caliph, he swooned away for laughing and said, "O Abu
al-Hasan, thou wilt never cease to be a wag and do peregrine things and
prodigious!" Quoth he: "O Commander of the Faithful, this trick I played
off for that the money which thou gavest me was exhausted, and I was
ashamed to ask of thee again. When I was single, I could never keep
money in hand, but since thou marriedst me to this damsel, if I
possessed even thy wealth, I should lay it waste. Wherefore when all
that was in my hand was spent, I wrought this sleight so I might get of
thee the hundred dinars and the piece of silk, and all this is an alms
from our lord. But now make haste to give me the thousand dinars and
acquit thee of thine oath." The Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah laughed and
returned to the palace, and he gave Abu al-Hasan the thousand dinars
saying, "Take them as a douceur for thy perservation from death," whilst
her mistress did the like with Nuzhat al-Fuad, honoring her with the
same words. Moreover, the Caliph increased the wag in his solde and
supplies, and he and his wife ceased not to live in joy and contentment
till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and Severer of
societies, the Plunderer of palaces, and the Gamerer of graves.
