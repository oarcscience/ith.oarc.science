<H1 align=center>CANTO 14</H1>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Two squadrons lack of those which muster under<BR>
King Agramant, by single Roland slain;<BR>
Hence furious Mandricardo, full of wonder<BR>
And envy, seeks the count by hill and plain:<BR>
Next joys himself with Doralice; such plunder,<BR>
Aided by heaven, his valiant arms obtain.<BR>
Rinaldo comes, with the angel-guide before,<BR>
To Paris, now assaulted by the Moor.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
In many a fierce assault and conflict dread,<BR>
&#8217;Twixt Spain and Afric and their Gallic foe,<BR>
Countless had been the slain, whose bodies fed<BR>
The ravening eagle, wolf, and greedy crow;<BR>
But though the Franks had worse in warfare sped,<BR>
Forced all the champaigne country to forego,<BR>
This had the paynims purchased at the cost<BR>
Of more good princes and bold barons lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
So bloody was the price of victory,<BR>
Small ground was left them triumphs to prepare;<BR>
And if, unconquered Duke Alphonso, we<BR>
May modern things with ancient deeds compare,<BR>
The battle, whose illustrious palm may be<BR>
Well worthily assigned to you to wear,<BR>
At whose remembrance sad Ravenna trembles,<BR>
And aye shall weep her loss, this field resembles.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
When the Calesians and the Picards yielding,<BR>
And troops of Normandy and Aquitaine,<BR>
You, with your valiant arms their squadrons shielding,<BR>
Stormed the almost victorious flags of Spain;<BR>
And those bold youths their trenchant weapons wielding,<BR>
Through parted squadrons, followed in your train;<BR>
Who on that day deserved you should accord,<BR>
For honoured gifts, the gilded spur and sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
You, with such glorious hearts, who were not slow<BR>
To follow, nor far off, the gorgeous oak<BR>
Seized, and shook down the golden acorns so,<BR>
And so the red and yellow truncheon broke,<BR>
That we to you our festive laurels owe,<BR>
And the fair lily, rescued from its stroke;<BR>
Another wreath may round your temples bloom,<BR>
In that Fabricius you preserved to Rome.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Rome&#8217;s mighty column, by your valiant hand<BR>
Taken and kept entire, more praise has shed<BR>
On you, than if the predatory band<BR>
Had routed by your single valour bled,<BR>
Of all who flocked to fat Ravenna&#8217;s land,<BR>
Or masterless, without a banner fled,<BR>
Of Arragon, Castile, or of Navarre;<BR>
When vain was lance or cannon&#8217;s thundering car.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
This dear-bought victory brought more relief<BR>
Than joy, by its event too much outweighed,<BR>
The loss of that French captain and our chief,<BR>
Whom dead we on the fatal field surveyed;<BR>
And swallowed in one storm, for further grief,<BR>
So many glorious princes, who, arrayed<BR>
For safeguard of their own, or neighbouring lands,<BR>
Had poured through, frozen Alps their friendly bands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Our present safety, and life held in fear,<BR>
We see assured us by this victory,<BR>
That saved us from the wintry tempest drear,<BR>
Which would have whelmed us from Jove&#8217;s angry sky.<BR>
But ill can we rejoice, while yet the tear<BR>
Is standing in full many a widow&#8217;s eye,<BR>
Who weeping and attired in sable, vents,<BR>
Throughout all grieving France, her loud laments.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis meet King Lewis should find new supplies<BR>
Of chiefs by whom his troops may be arrayed,<BR>
Who for the lilies&#8217; honour shall chastise<BR>
The hands which so rapaciously have preyed;<BR>
Who brethren, black and white, in shameful wise,<BR>
Have outraged, sister, mother, wife, and maid,<BR>
And cast on earth Christ&#8217;s sacrament divine,<BR>
With the intent to thieve his silver shrine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Hadst thou not made resistance to thy foe,<BR>
Better, Ravenna, had it been for thee,<BR>
And thou been warned by Brescia&#8217;s fate, than so<BR>
Thine should Faenza warn and Rimini.<BR>
O Lewis, bid good old Trivulzio go<BR>
With thine, and to thy bands example be,<BR>
And tell what ills such license still has bred,<BR>
Heaping our ample Italy with dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
As the illustrious King of France has need<BR>
Of captains to supply his leaders lost,<BR>
So the two kings who Spain and Afric lead,<BR>
To give new order to the double host,<BR>
Resolve their bands should muster on the mead,<BR>
From winter lodgings moved and various post;<BR>
That they may furnish, as their wants demand,<BR>
A guide and government to every band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Marsilius first, and after Agramant,<BR>
Passing it troop by troop their army scan.<BR>
The Catalonians, who their captain vaunt<BR>
In Doriphoebus, muster in the van;<BR>
And next, without their monarch Fulvirant,<BR>
Erst killed by good Rinaldo, comes the clan<BR>
Of bold Navarre; whose guideless band to steer<BR>
The King of Spain appoints Sir Isolier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
With Balugantes Leon&#8217;s race comes on,<BR>
The Algarbi governed by Grandonio wheel.<BR>
The brother of Marsilius, Falsiron,<BR>
Brings up with him the power of Less Castile.<BR>
They follow Madarasso&#8217;s gonfalon,<BR>
Who have left Malaga and fair Seville,<BR>
&#8217;Twixt fruitful Cordova and Cadiz-bay,<BR>
Where through green banks the Betis winds its way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Stordilane, Tessira, and Baricond,<BR>
After each other, next their forces stirred;<BR>
This in Grenada, that in Lisbon crowned;<BR>
Majorca was obedient to the third.<BR>
Larbino had Lisbon ruled, whose golden round<BR>
Was at his death on Tessira conferred;<BR>
His kinsman he: Gallicia came in guide<BR>
Or Serpentine, who Mericold supplied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
They of Toledo and of Calatrave,<BR>
Who erst with Sinnagon&#8217;s broad banner spread,<BR>
Marched, and the multitude who drink and lave<BR>
Their limbs in chrystal Guadiana&#8217;s bed,<BR>
Came thither, under Matalista brave;<BR>
Beneath Bianzardin, their common head,<BR>
Astorga, Salamanca, Placenza,<BR>
With Avila, Zamorra, and Palenza.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
The household-troops which guard Marsilius&#8217; state,<BR>
And Saragossa&#8217;s men, Ferrau commands;<BR>
And in this force, well-sheathed in mail and plate,<BR>
Bold Malgarine and Balinverno stands;<BR>
Morgant and Malzarise, whom common fate<BR>
Had both condemned to dwell in foreign lands,<BR>
Who, when dethroned, had to Marsilius&#8217; court<BR>
(There hospitably harboured) made resort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Follicon, Kind Marsilius&#8217; bastard, hies<BR>
With valiant Doricont; amid this horde,<BR>
Bavartes, Analard, and Argalise,<BR>
And Archidantes, the Saguntine lord.<BR>
Here, Malagur, in ready cunning wise,<BR>
And Ammirant and Langhiran the sword<BR>
Unsheath, and march; of whom I shall endite,<BR>
When it is time, their prowess to recite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
When so had filed the warlike host of Spain<BR>
In fair review before King Agramant,<BR>
Appeared King Oran with his martial train,<BR>
Who might almost a giant&#8217;s stature vaunt;<BR>
Next they who weep their Martasino, slain<BR>
By the avenging sword of Bradamant,<BR>
King of the Garamantes, and lament<BR>
That woman triumphs in their monarch spent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Marmonda&#8217;s men next past the royal Moor,<BR>
Who left Argosto dead on Gascon meads;<BR>
And this unguided band, like that before,<BR>
As well as the fourth troop, a captain needs.<BR>
Although King Agramant has little store<BR>
Of chiefs, he feigns a choice, and thinks; next speeds<BR>
Buraldo, Ormida, and Arganio tried,<BR>
Where needing, the unordered troops to guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
He give Arganio charge of Libicane,<BR>
Who wept the sable Dudrinasso dead.<BR>
Brunello guides the men of Tingitane,<BR>
With cloudy countenance and drooping head;<BR>
Who since he in the wooded mountain-chain<BR>
(Nigh where Atlantes dwelt), to her he led,<BR>
Fair Bradamant, had lost the virtuous ring,<BR>
Had lived in the displeasure of his king;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
And but that Ferrau&#8217;s brother Isolier,<BR>
Who fastened to a stem had found him there,<BR>
Made to King Agramant the truth appear,<BR>
He from the gallows-tree had swung in air:<BR>
Already fastened was the noose, and near<BR>
The caitiff&#8217;s fate, when at the many&#8217;s prayer<BR>
The king bade loose him; but reprieving, swore,<BR>
For his first fault to hang, offending more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Thus, not without a cause, Brunello pined,<BR>
And showed a mournful face, and hung his head.<BR>
Next Farurantes; to whose care consigned,<BR>
Maurina&#8217;s valiant horse and footmen tread.<BR>
The new-made king Libanio comes behind,<BR>
By whom are Constatina&#8217;s people led:<BR>
Since Agramant the crown and staff of gold,<BR>
Once Pinador&#8217;s, had given to him to hold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Hesperia&#8217;s people come with Soridan,<BR>
With Dorilon the men of Setta ride;<BR>
The Nasamonians troop with Pulian,<BR>
And Agricaltes is Ammonia&#8217;s guide.<BR>
Malabupherso rules o&#8217;er Fezzan&#8217;s clan,<BR>
And Finaduro leads the band supplied<BR>
By the Canary Islands and Morocco:<BR>
Balastro fills the place of king Tardocco.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Next Mulga and Arzilla&#8217;s legions two.<BR>
The first beneath their ancient captains wend;<BR>
The second troop without a leader, who<BR>
Are given to Corineus, the sovereign&#8217;s friend.<BR>
So (late Tanphirion&#8217;s) Almonsilla&#8217;s crew,<BR>
To a new monarch in Caichus bend.<BR>
Goetulia is bestowed on Rhimedont,<BR>
And Cosca comes in charge of Balinfront.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Ruled by Clarindo, Bolga&#8217;s people go,<BR>
Who fills the valiant Mirabaldo&#8217;s post:<BR>
Him Baliverso, whom I&#8217;d have you know<BR>
For the worst ribald in that ample host,<BR>
Succeeded next. I think not, &#8217;mid that show,<BR>
The bannered camp a firmer troop could boast<BR>
Than that which followed in Sobrino&#8217;s care;<BR>
Nor Saracen than him more wise and ware.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Gualciotto dead, Bellamarina&#8217;s crew,<BR>
(His vassals) serve, the sovereign of Algiers,<BR>
King Rodomont, of Sarza; that anew<BR>
Brought up a band of foot and cavaliers:<BR>
Whom, when the cloudy sun his rays withdrew<BR>
Beneath the Centaur and the Goat, his spears<BR>
There to recruit, was sent to the Afric shore<BR>
By Agramant, returned three days before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
There was no Saracen of bolder strain,<BR>
Of all the chiefs who Moorish squadrons led;<BR>
And Paris-town (nor is the terror vain)<BR>
More of the puissant warrior stands in dread<BR>
Than of King Agramant and all the train,<BR>
Which he, or the renowned Marsilius head;<BR>
And amid all that mighty muster, more<BR>
Than others, hatred to our faith he bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Prusion is the Alvaracchia&#8217;s king: below<BR>
King Dardinello&#8217;s flag Zumara&#8217;s power<BR>
Is ranged. I wot not, I, if owl or crow,<BR>
Or other bird ill-omened, which from tower<BR>
Or tree croaks future evil, did foreshow<BR>
To one or to the other, that the hour<BR>
Was fixed in heaven, when on the following day<BR>
Either should perish in this deadly fray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Noritia&#8217;s men and Tremisene&#8217;s alone<BR>
Were wanting to complete the paynim host;<BR>
But in the martial muster sign was none,<BR>
Nor tale, nor tiding of the squadrons lost;<BR>
To wondering Agramant alike unknown,<BR>
What kept the slothful warriors from their post,<BR>
When of King Tremisene&#8217;s a squire was brought<BR>
Before him, who at large the mischief taught;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8212;Who taught how Manilardo was laid low,<BR>
Alzirdo, and many others, on the plain.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the bearer of the news, &#8220;the foe<BR>
Who slew our troop, would all thy camp have slain,<BR>
If thine assembled host had been more slow<BR>
Than me, who, as it was, escaped with pain.<BR>
This man slays horse and foot, as in the cote,<BR>
The wolf makes easy waste of sheep and goat.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Where the bold Africans their standards plant,<BR>
A warrior had arrived some days before;<BR>
Nor was there in the west, or whole Levant,<BR>
A knight, with heart or prowess gifted more.<BR>
To him much grace was done by Agramant,<BR>
As successor of Agrican, who wore<BR>
The crown of Tartary, a warrior wight;<BR>
The son the famous Mandricardo hight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Renowned he was for many a glorious quest<BR>
Atchieved, and through the world his fame was blown.<BR>
But him had glorified above the rest<BR>
Worth in the Syrian fairy&#8217;s castle shown:<BR>
Where mail, which cased the Trojan Hector&#8217;s breast<BR>
A thousand years before, he made his own.<BR>
And finished that adventure, strange and fell;<BR>
A story which breeds terror but to tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
When the squire told his news amid that show<BR>
Of troops, was present Agrican&#8217;s bold son,<BR>
Who raised his daring face, resolved to go<BR>
And find the warrior who the deed had done;<BR>
But the design he hatched, forebore to show;<BR>
As making small account of any one,<BR>
Or fearing lest, should he reveal his thought,<BR>
The quest by other champion might be sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
He of the squire demanded what the vest<BR>
And bearings, which the valiant stranger wore;<BR>
Who answered that he went without a crest,<BR>
And sable shield and sable surcoat bore.<BR>
&#8212;And, sir, &#8217;twas true; for so was Roland drest;<BR>
The old device renounced he had before:<BR>
For as he mourned within, so he without,<BR>
The symbols of his grief would bear about.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Marsilius had to Mandricardo sped,<BR>
As gift, a courser of a chestnut stain,<BR>
Whose legs and mane were sable; he was bred<BR>
Between a Friesland mare and nag of Spain.<BR>
King Mandricardo, armed from foot to head,<BR>
Leapt on the steed and galloped o&#8217;er the plain,<BR>
And swore upon the camp to turn his back<BR>
Till he should find the champion clad in black.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
The king encounters many of the crew<BR>
Whom good Orlando&#8217;s arm had put to flight;<BR>
And some a son, and some a brother rue,<BR>
Who in the rout had perished in their sight;<BR>
And in the coward&#8217;s cheek of pallid hue<BR>
Is yet pourtrayed the sad and craven sprite:<BR>
&#8212;Yet, through the fear endured, they far and nigh,<BR>
Pallid, and silent, and insensate fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Nor he long was had rode, ere he descried<BR>
A passing-cruel spectacle and sore;<BR>
But which the wonderous feats well testified,<BR>
That were recounted Agramant before.<BR>
Now on this hand, now that, the dead he eyed,<BR>
Measured their wounds, and turned their bodies o&#8217;er;<BR>
Moved by strange envy of the knight whose hand<BR>
Had strown the champaign with the slaughtered band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
As wolf or mastiff-dog, who comes the last<BR>
Where the remains of slaughtered bullock lie,<BR>
And finds but horn and bones, where rich repast<BR>
Had fed the ravening hound and vulture night,<BR>
Glares vainly on the scull, unsmacked; so passed<BR>
The barbarous Tartar king those bodies by;<BR>
And grudged, lamenting, like the hungry beast,<BR>
To have come too late for such a sumptuous feast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
That day, and half the next, in search he strayed<BR>
Of him who wore the sable vest and shield.<BR>
When lo! he saw a mead, o&#8217;ertopt with shade,<BR>
Where a deep river wound about the field,<BR>
With narrow space between the turns it made,<BR>
Where&#8217;er from side to side the water wheeled.<BR>
Even such a spot as this with circling waves<BR>
Below Otricoli the Tyber laves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Where this deep stream was fordable, he scanned<BR>
A crowd of cavaliers that armour bore:<BR>
And these the paynim questioned who had manned,<BR>
With such a troop, and to what end, the shore?<BR>
To him replied the captain of the band,<BR>
Moved by his lordly air, and arms he wore,<BR>
Glittering with gold and jewels,&#8212;costly gear,<BR>
Which showed him an illustrious cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In charge&#8221; (he said) &#8220;we of the daughter go<BR>
Of him our king, who fills Granada&#8217;s throne,<BR>
Espoused by Rodomont of Sarza, though<BR>
To fame the tidings are as yet unknown.<BR>
And we, departing when the sun is low,<BR>
And the cicala hushed, which now alone<BR>
Is heard, shall bring her where her father keeps<BR>
I&#8217; the Spanish camp; meanwhile the lady sleeps.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
He who for scorn had daffed the world aside,<BR>
Designs to see at once, how able were<BR>
Those horsemen to defend the royal bride,<BR>
Committed by their sovereign to their care.<BR>
&#8220;The maid, by what I hear, is fair&#8221; (he cried).<BR>
&#8220;Fain would I now be certified, how fair:<BR>
Then me to her, or her to me convey,<BR>
For I must quickly wend another way.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou needs art raving mad,&#8221; replied in few<BR>
The chief,&#8212;nor more. But with his lance in rest,<BR>
The Tartar monarch at the speaker flew,<BR>
And with the levelled spear transfixed his breast.<BR>
For the point pierced the yielding corslet through,<BR>
And lifeless he, perforce, the champaign prest.<BR>
The son of Agrican his lance regained,<BR>
Who weaponless without the spear remained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
Now sword nor club the warlike Tartar bore,<BR>
Since, when the Trojan Hector&#8217;s plate and chain<BR>
He gained, because the faulchion lacked, he swore<BR>
(To this obliged), nor swore the king in vain,<BR>
That save he won the blade Orlando wore,<BR>
He would no other grasp,&#8212;that Durindane.<BR>
Held in high value by Almontes bold,<BR>
Which Roland bears, and Hector bore of old.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Great is the Tartar monarch&#8217;s daring, those<BR>
At such a disadvantage to assay,<BR>
He pricks, with levelled lance, among his foes,<BR>
Shouting, in fury,&#8212;&#8220;Who shall bar my way?&#8221;&#8212;<BR>
Round and about him suddenly they close;<BR>
These draw the faulchion, and those others lay<BR>
The spear in rest: a multitude he slew,<BR>
Before his lance was broke upon the crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
When this he saw was broke, the truncheon sound<BR>
And yet entire, he took, both hands between,<BR>
And with so many bodies strewed the ground,<BR>
That direr havoc never yet was seen:<BR>
And as with that jaw bone, by hazard found,<BR>
The Hebrew Samson slew the Philistine,<BR>
Crushed helm and shield; and often side by side,<BR>
Slain by the truncheon, horse and rider died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
In running to their death the wretches vie,<BR>
Nor cease because their comrades perish near:<BR>
Yet bitterer in such a mode to die,<BR>
Than death itself, does to the troop appear.<BR>
They grudge to forfeit precious life, and lie<BR>
Crushed by the fragment of a broken spear;<BR>
And think foul scorn beneath the pounding stake<BR>
Strangely to die the death of frog or snake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
But after they at their expense had read<BR>
That it was ill to die in any way,<BR>
And near two thirds were now already dead,<BR>
The rest began to fly in disarray.<BR>
As if with what was his the vanquished fled,<BR>
The cruel paynim, cheated of his prey,<BR>
Ill bore that any, from the murderous strife<BR>
Of that scared rabble, should escape with life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
As in the well-dried fen or stubble-land,<BR>
Short time the stalk endures, or stridulous reed,<BR>
Against the flames, which careful rustic&#8217;s hand<BR>
Scatters when Boreas blows the fires to feed;<BR>
What time they take, and by the north-wind fanned.<BR>
Crackle and snap, and through the furrow speed;<BR>
No otherwise, with little profit, those<BR>
King Mandricardo&#8217;s kindled wrath oppose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
When afterwards he marks the entrance free,<BR>
Left ill-secured, and without sentinel.<BR>
He, following prints (which had been recently<BR>
Marked on the mead), proceeds, amid the swell<BR>
Of loud laments, Granada&#8217;s dame to see,<BR>
If she as beauteous were as what they tell.<BR>
He wound his way &#8217;mid corpses, where the wave,<BR>
Winding from side to side, a passage gave:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
And in the middle of the mead surveyed<BR>
Doralice (such the gentle lady&#8217;s name),<BR>
Who, at the root of an old ash tree laid,<BR>
Bemoaned her: fast her lamentations came.<BR>
And tears, like plenteous vein of water, strayed<BR>
Into the beauteous bosom of the dame;<BR>
Who, (so it from her lovely face appeared,)<BR>
For others mourned, while for herself she feared.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Her fear increased when she approaching spied<BR>
Him foul with blood, and marked his felon cheer;<BR>
And piercing shrieks the very sky divide<BR>
Raised by herself and followers, in their fear.<BR>
For over and above the troop who guide<BR>
The fair infanta, squire and cavalier,<BR>
Came ancient men and matrons in her train,<BR>
And maids, the fairest of Granada&#8217;s reign.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
When that fair face by him of Tartary<BR>
Is seen, which has no paragon in Spain,<BR>
Where amid tears (in laughter what were she?)<BR>
Is twisted Love&#8217;s inextricable chain.<BR>
He knows not if in heaven or earth he be;<BR>
Nor from his victory reaps other gain,<BR>
Than yielding up himself a thrall to her,<BR>
(He knows not why) who was his prisoner.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Yet not so far his courtesy he strained,<BR>
That he would lose his labour&#8217;s fruit, although<BR>
The royal damsel showed, who sorely plained,<BR>
Such grief as women in despair can show.<BR>
He, who the hope within him entertained<BR>
To turn to sovereign joy her present woe,<BR>
Would wholly bear her off; whom having placed<BR>
On a white jennet, he his way retraced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
He dames, maids, ancient men, and others, who<BR>
Had from Granada with the damsel fared,<BR>
Kindly dismissed, their journey to pursue;<BR>
Saying, &#8220;My care suffices; I of guard,<BR>
Of guide, of handmaid will the office do,<BR>
To serve her in her every need prepared.<BR>
Farewell!&#8221; and thus unable to withstand<BR>
The wrong, with tears and sighs withdrew the band,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Saying, &#8220;How woe-begone will be her sire,<BR>
When he the miserable case shall hear!<BR>
What grief will be the bridegroom&#8217;s! what his ire!<BR>
How dread the vengeance of that cavalier!<BR>
When so the lady&#8217;s needs such help require.<BR>
Alas! and why is not the champion near,<BR>
To save the illustrious blood of Stordilane,<BR>
Ere the thief bears her farther hence, from stain?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
The Tartar, joying in the prize possest,<BR>
Which he by chance and valour won and wore;<BR>
To find the warrior of the sable vest<BR>
Seemed not to have the haste he had before,<BR>
And stopp&#8217;d and loitered, where he whilom prest;<BR>
And cast about and studied evermore<BR>
To find some fitting shelter; with desire,<BR>
In quiet to exhale such amorous fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Doralice he consoled this while, whose eyes<BR>
And cheek were wetted with the frequent tear,<BR>
And many matters feigned and flattering lies;<BR>
&#8212;How, known by fame, he long had held her dear,<BR>
And how his country and glad realm, whose size<BR>
Shamed others, praised for grandeur far and near,<BR>
He quitted, not for sight of France or Spain;<BR>
But to behold that cheek of lovely grain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If a man merits love by loving, I<BR>
Yours by my love deserve; if it is won<BR>
By birth,&#8212;who boasts a genealogy<BR>
Like me, the puissant Agricano&#8217;s son?<BR>
By riches,&#8212;who with me in wealth can vie.<BR>
That in dominion yield to God alone?<BR>
By courage,&#8212;I to-day (I ween) have proved<BR>
That I for courage merit to be loved.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
These words, and many others on his part,<BR>
Love frames and dictates to the Tartar knight,<BR>
Which sweetly tend to cheer the afflicted heart<BR>
Of the unhappy maid, disturbed with fright.<BR>
By these fear first was laid, and next the smart<BR>
Sheathed of that woe, which had nigh pierced her sprite;<BR>
And with more patience thence the maid began<BR>
To hear, and her new lover&#8217;s reasons scan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Next much more affable, with courteous lore<BR>
Seasoning her answers to his suit, replies;<BR>
Nor looking at the king, sometimes forbore<BR>
To fix upon his face her pitying eyes.<BR>
The paynim thence, whom Love had smote before,<BR>
Not hopeful now, but certain, of his prize,<BR>
Deemed that the lovely damsel would not still,<BR>
As late, be found rebellious to his will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Riding in her glad company a-field,<BR>
Which so rejoiced his soul, so satisfied;<BR>
And being near the time, when to their bield,<BR>
Warned by the chilly night, all creatures hied,<BR>
Seeing the sun now low and half concealed,<BR>
The warrior &#8217;gan in greater hurry ride;<BR>
Until he heard reed-pipe and whistle sound,<BR>
And next saw farm and cabin smoking round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Pastoral lodgings were the dwellings near,<BR>
Less formed for show, than for conveniency;<BR>
And the young damsel and the cavalier<BR>
The herdsman welcomed with such courtesy,<BR>
That both were pleasured by his kindly cheer.<BR>
For not alone dwells Hospitality<BR>
In court and city; but ofttimes we find<BR>
In loft and cottage men of gentle kind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
What afterwards was done at close of day<BR>
Between the damsel and the Tartar lord,<BR>
I will not take upon myself to say;<BR>
So leave to each, at pleasure, to award.<BR>
But as they rose the following morn more gay,<BR>
It would appear they were of fair accord:<BR>
And on the swain who them such honour showed,<BR>
Her thanks at parting Doralice bestowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Thence from one place to the other wandering, they<BR>
Find themselves by a river, as they go.<BR>
Which to the sea in silence winds its way,<BR>
And ill could be pronounced to stand or flow,<BR>
So clear and limpid, that the cheerful day,<BR>
With nought to intercept it, pierced below.<BR>
Upon its bank, beneath a cooling shade,<BR>
They found two warriors and a damsel laid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Now lofty Fancy, which one course to run<BR>
Permits not, calls me hence in sudden wise;<BR>
And thither I return, where paynims stun<BR>
Fair France with hosile din and angry cries,<BR>
About the tent, wherein Troyano&#8217;s son<BR>
They holy empire in his wrath defies,<BR>
And boastful Rodomont, with vengeful doom,<BR>
Gives Paris to the flames, and levels Rome.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Tidings had reached the Moorish sovereign&#8217;s ear<BR>
That the English had already passed the sea;<BR>
And he bade Garbo&#8217;s aged king appear,<BR>
Marsilius, and his heads of chivalry:<BR>
Who all advised the monarch to prepare<BR>
For the assault of Paris. They may be<BR>
Assured they in the storm will never thrive,<BR>
Unless &#8217;tis made before the aids arrive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Innumerable ladders for the scale<BR>
Had been collected upon every hand,<BR>
And plank and beam, and hurdle&#8217;s twisted mail,<BR>
For different uses, at the king&#8217;s command;<BR>
And bridge and boat; and, what might more avail<BR>
Than all the rest, a first and second band<BR>
For the assault (so bids the monarch) form;<BR>
Who will himself go forth with them that storm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
The emperor, on the vigil of the day<BR>
Of battle, within Paris, everywhere,<BR>
By priest and friar of orders black and gray,<BR>
And white, bade celebrate mass-rite and prayer;<BR>
And those who had confessed, a fair array,<BR>
And from the Stygian demons rescued were,<BR>
Communicated in such fashions, all,<BR>
As if they were the ensuing day to fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
At the high church, he, girt with paladine<BR>
And preachers of the word, and barons brave,<BR>
With much devotion at those acts divine<BR>
Assisted, and a fair example gave;<BR>
And there with folded hands and face supine,<BR>
Exclaimed, &#8220;O Lord! although my sins be grave,<BR>
Permit not, that, in this their utmost need,<BR>
Thy people suffer for their king&#8217;s misdeed!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if that they should suffer is thy will,<BR>
And that they should due penance undergo,<BR>
At least delay thy purpose to fulfil;<BR>
So that thine enemies deal not the blow.<BR>
For, when &#8217;tis given him in his wrath to kill<BR>
Us who are deemed thy friends, the paynim foe,<BR>
That thou art without power to save, will cry,<BR>
Because thou lett&#8217;st thy faithful people die:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, for one faithless found, against thy sway<BR>
A hundred shall throughout the world rebel;<BR>
So that false Babel&#8217;s law will have its way,<BR>
And thus thy blessed faith put down and quell.<BR>
Defend thy suffering people, who are they<BR>
That purged thy tomb from heathen hounds and fell.<BR>
And many times and oft, by foes offended,<BR>
Thy holy church and vicars have defended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That our deserts unfitting are to place<BR>
I&#8217; the scale against our mighty debt, I know;<BR>
Nor pardon can we hope, if we retrace<BR>
Our sinful lives; but if thou shouldst bestow<BR>
In aid, the gift of they redeeming grace,<BR>
The account is quit and balanced, that we owe;<BR>
Nor can we of thy succour, Lord, despair,<BR>
While we in mind thy saving mercy bear.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
So spake the holy emperor aloud,<BR>
In humbleness of heart and deep contrition;<BR>
And added other prayers withal, and vowed<BR>
What fitted his great needs and high condition.<BR>
Now was his supplication disallowed;<BR>
For his good genius hears the king&#8217;s petition,<BR>
Best of the seraphs he; who spreads his wings,<BR>
And to the Saviour&#8217;s feet this offering brings.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Infinite other prayers as well preferred,<BR>
Were, by like couriers, to the Godhead&#8217;s ear<BR>
So borne; which when the blessed spirits heard,<BR>
They all together gazed, with pitying cheer,<BR>
On their eternal, loving Lord, and, stirred<BR>
With one desire, besought that he would hear<BR>
The just petition, to his ears conveyed,<BR>
Of this his Christian people, seeking aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
And the ineffable Goodness, who in vain<BR>
Was never sought by faithful heart, an eye,<BR>
Full of compassion, raised; and from the train<BR>
Waved Michael, and to the arch-angel: &#8220;Hie,<BR>
To seek the Christian host that crost the main,<BR>
And lately furled their sails in Picardy:<BR>
These so conduct to Paris, that their tramp<BR>
And noise be heard not in the hostile camp.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Find Silence first, and bid him, on my part,<BR>
On this emprize attend thee, at thy side:<BR>
Since he for such a quest, with happiest art<BR>
Will know what is most fitting to provide.<BR>
Next, where she sojourns, instantly impart<BR>
To Discord my command, that she, supplied<BR>
With steel and tinder, &#8217;mid the paynims go,<BR>
And fire and flame in their encampment blow;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And throughout those among them, who are said<BR>
To be the mightiest, spread such strife, that they<BR>
Together may contend, and that some dead<BR>
Remain, some hurt, some taken in the fray;<BR>
And some to leave the camp, by wrath, be led;<BR>
So that they yield their sovereign little stay.&#8221;<BR>
Nothing the blessed winged-one replies,<BR>
But swoops descending from the starry skies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Where&#8217;er the angel Michael turns his wing,<BR>
The clouds are scattered and the sky turns bright;<BR>
About his person forms a golden ring,<BR>
As we see summer lightning gleam at night.<BR>
This while the courier of the heavenly king<BR>
Thinks, on his way, where he may best alight,<BR>
With the intent to find that foe to speech,<BR>
To whom he first his high behest would teach.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Upon the thought the posting angel brooded,<BR>
Where he, for whom he sought was used to dwell,<BR>
Who after thinking much, at last concluded<BR>
Him he should find in church or convent cell;<BR>
Where social speech is in such mode excluded,<BR>
That SILENCE, where the cloistered brethren swell<BR>
Their anthems, where they sleep, and where they sit<BR>
At meat; and everywhere in fine is writ.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Weening that he shall find him here, he plies<BR>
With greater speed his plumes of gilded scale,<BR>
And deems as well that Peace, here guested, lies,<BR>
And Charity and Quiet, without fail.<BR>
But finds he is deceived in his surmise,<BR>
As soon as he has past the cloister&#8217;s pale.<BR>
Here Silence is not; nor (&#8217;tis said) is found<BR>
Longer, except in writing, on this ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Nor here he Love, nor here he Peace surveys,<BR>
Piety, Quiet, or Humility.<BR>
Here dwelt they once; but &#8217;twas in ancient days;<BR>
Chased hence by Avarice, Anger, Gluttony,<BR>
Pride, Envy, Sloth, and Cruelty. In amaze<BR>
The angel mused upon such novelty:<BR>
He narrowly the hideous squadron eyed,<BR>
And Discord too amid the rest espied;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Even her, to whom the eternal Sire as well,<BR>
Having found Silence, bade him to repair.<BR>
He had believed he to Avernus&#8217; cell,<BR>
Where she was harboured with the damned, must fare,<BR>
And now discerned her in this other hell<BR>
(Who would believe it?) amid mass and prayer.<BR>
Strange Michael thought to see her there enshrined,<BR>
Whom he believed he must go far to find.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Her by her party-coloured vest he knew.<BR>
Unequal strips and many formed the gown,<BR>
Which, opening with her walk, or wind that blew,<BR>
Now showed, now hid her; for they were unsown.<BR>
Her hair appeared to be at strife; in hue<BR>
Like silver and like gold, and black and brown;<BR>
Part in a tress, in riband part comprest,<BR>
Some on her shoulders flowed, some on her breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Examinations, summons, and a store<BR>
Of writs and letters of attorney, she,<BR>
And hearings, in her hands and bosom bore,<BR>
And consultation, and authority:<BR>
Weapons, from which the substance of the poor<BR>
Can never safe in walled city be.<BR>
Before, behind her, and about her, wait<BR>
Attorney, notary, and advocate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Her Michael calls to him, and give command<BR>
That she among the strongest paynims go;<BR>
And find occasion whence amid the band<BR>
Warfare and memorable scathe may grow.<BR>
He next from her of Silence makes demand,<BR>
Who of his motions easily might know;<BR>
As one who from one land to the other hied,<BR>
Kindling and scattering fire on either side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I recollect not ever to have viewed<BR>
Him anywhere,&#8221; quoth Discord in reply;<BR>
&#8220;But oft have heard him mentioned, and for shrewd<BR>
Greatly commended by the general cry:<BR>
But Fraud, who makes one of this multitude,<BR>
And who has sometimes kept him company,<BR>
I think, can furnish news of him to thee,<BR>
And&#8221; (pointing with her finger) &#8220;that is she.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
With pleasing mien, grave walk, and decent vest,<BR>
Fraud rolled her eye-balls humbly in her head;<BR>
And such benign and modest speech possest,<BR>
She might a Gabriel seem who Ave said.<BR>
Foul was she and deformed, in all the rest;<BR>
But with a mantle long and widely spread,<BR>
Concealed her hideous parts; and evermore<BR>
Beneath the stole a poisoned dagger wore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Of her the good archangel made demand<BR>
What way in search of Silence to pursue:<BR>
Who said; &#8220;He with the Virtues once was scanned<BR>
Nor dwelt elsewhere; aye guested by the crew<BR>
Of Benedict, or blest Elias&#8217; band,<BR>
When abbeys and when convent-cells were new;<BR>
And whilom in the schools long time did pass,<BR>
With sage Archytas and Pythagorus.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But those philosophers and saints of yore<BR>
Extinguished, who had been his former stay,<BR>
From the good habits he had used before<BR>
He passed to evil ones; began to stray,<BR>
Changing his life, at night with lovers, bore<BR>
Thieves company, and sinned in every way:<BR>
He oftentimes consorts with Treason; further,<BR>
I even have beheld him leagued with Murther.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With coiners him you oftentimes may see<BR>
Harbour in some obscure and close repair.<BR>
So oft he changes home and company,<BR>
To light on him would be a fortune rare:<BR>
Yet have I hope to point him out to thee;<BR>
If to Sleep&#8217;s house thou wilt at midnight fare,<BR>
Him wilt thou surely find; for to repose<BR>
At night he ever to that harbour goes.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Though Fraud was alway wont to deal in lies,<BR>
So like the simple truth appears her say,<BR>
The angel yields the tale belief; and flies<BR>
Forth from the monastery without delay,<BR>
Tempers his speed, and schemes withal in wise<BR>
To finish at the appointed time his way,<BR>
That at the house of Sleep (the mansion blind<BR>
Full well he knew) this Silence he may find.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
In blest Arabia lies a pleasant vale,<BR>
Removed from village and from city&#8217;s reach.<BR>
By two fair hills o&#8217;ershadowed is the dale,<BR>
And full of ancient fir and sturdy beech.<BR>
Thither the circling sun without avail<BR>
Conveys the cheerful daylight: for no breach<BR>
The rays can make through boughs spread thickly round;<BR>
And it is here a cave runs under ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Beneath the shadow of this forest deep,<BR>
Into the rock there runs a grotto wide.<BR>
Here widely wandering, ivy-suckers creep,<BR>
About the cavern&#8217;s entrance multiplied.<BR>
Harboured within this grot lies heavy Sleep,<BR>
Ease, corpulent and gross, upon this side,<BR>
Upon that, Sloth, on earth has made her seat;<BR>
Who cannot go, and hardly keeps her feet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Mindless Oblivion at the gate is found,<BR>
Who lets none enter, and agnizes none;<BR>
Nor message hears or bears, and from that ground<BR>
Without distinction chases every one;<BR>
While Silence plays the scout and walks his round,<BR>
Equipt with shoes of felt and mantle brown,<BR>
And motions from a distance all who meet<BR>
Him on his circuit, from the dim retreat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
The angel him approaches quietly,<BR>
And, &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis God&#8217;s bidding&#8221; (whispers in his ear)<BR>
&#8220;That thou Rinaldo and his company,<BR>
Brought in his sovereign&#8217;s aid, to Paris steer:<BR>
But that thou do the deed so silently,<BR>
That not a Saracen their cry shall hear;<BR>
So that their army come upon the foe,<BR>
Ere he from Fame of their arrival know.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Silence to him no otherwise replied<BR>
Than signing with his head that he obeyed:<BR>
(And took his post behind the heavenly guide)<BR>
Both at one flight to Picardy conveyed.<BR>
The angel moved those bands of valour tried,<BR>
And short to them a tedious distance made:<BR>
Whom he to Paris safe transports; while none<BR>
Is conscious that a miracle is done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Silence the advancing troop kept skirting round,<BR>
In front, and flank, and rear of the array;<BR>
Above the band he spread a mist profound,<BR>
And everywhere beside &#8217;twas lightsome day;<BR>
Nor through the impeding fog the shrilling sound<BR>
Of horn was heard, without, or trumpet&#8217;s bray.<BR>
He next the hostile paynims went to find,<BR>
And with I know not what made deaf and blind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
While with such haste his band Rinaldo led,<BR>
That him an angel well might seem to guide,<BR>
And in such silence moved, that nought was said<BR>
Or heard of this upon the paynim side;<BR>
King Agramant his infantry had spread<BR>
Throughout fair Paris&#8217; suburbs, and beside<BR>
The foss, and underneath the walls; that day<BR>
To make upon the place his worst assay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
He who the Moorish monarch&#8217;s force would tell,<BR>
Which Charlemagne this day will have to meet,<BR>
In wooded Apennine might count as well<BR>
The trees upon its back, or waves that beat<BR>
(What time the troubled waters highest swell)<BR>
Against the Mauritanian Atlas&#8217; feet;<BR>
Or watch at midnight with how many eyes<BR>
The furtive works of lovers Heaven espies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
The larum-bells, loud-sounding through the air,<BR>
Stricken with frequent blows, the town affray;<BR>
And in the crowded temples every where<BR>
Movement of lips and hands upraised to pray<BR>
Are seen: if treasure seemed to God so fair<BR>
As to our foolish thoughts, upon this day<BR>
The holy consistory had bid mould<BR>
Their every statue upon earth in gold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Lamenting may be heard the aged just,<BR>
In that they were reserved for such a woe;<BR>
Calling those happy that in sacred dust<BR>
Were buried many and many a year ago.<BR>
But the bold youths who, valiant and robust,<BR>
Small thought upon the approaching ills bestow,<BR>
Scorning their elders&#8217; counsel, here and there<BR>
Hurrying, in fury, to the walls repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Here might you paladin and baron ken,<BR>
King, duke, and marquis, count and chivalry,<BR>
And soldier, foreigner or citizen,<BR>
Ready for honour and for Christ to die;<BR>
Who, eager to assail the Saracen,<BR>
On Charlemagne to lower the bridges cry.<BR>
He witnesses with joy their martial beat,<BR>
But to permit their sally deems not meet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
And them he ordered in convenient post,<BR>
The advance of the barbarians to impede:<BR>
For this would ill suffice a numerous host,<BR>
To that he was content that few should speed.<BR>
Some worked at the machines, some wild-fire tost,<BR>
All ranged according to the separate need.<BR>
Charles, never in one place, with restless care<BR>
Provides defence and succour every where.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
Paris is seated on a spacious plain,<BR>
I&#8217; the midst&#8212;the heart of France, more justly say.<BR>
A stream flows into it, and forth again;<BR>
But first, the passing waters, as they stray,<BR>
An island form, and so secure the main<BR>
And better part, dividing on their way.<BR>
The other two (three separate quarters note).<BR>
Within the river girds, without the moat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
The town, whose walls for miles in circuit run,<BR>
Might well have been attacked from many a side;<BR>
Yet, for he would assail it but on one,<BR>
Nor willingly his scattered troops divide,<BR>
Westward beyond the stream Troyano&#8217;s son<BR>
Retired, from thence the assailing bands to guide.<BR>
In that, he neither city had nor plain<BR>
Behind, but what was his, as far as Spain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
Where&#8217;er the walls of Paris wound about,<BR>
Large ammunition had king Charles purveyed;<BR>
Strengthening with dyke each quarter held in doubt;<BR>
And had within trench, drain, and casemate made:<BR>
And where the river entered and went out,<BR>
Had thickest chains across the channel laid.<BR>
But most of all, his prudent cares appear<BR>
Where there is greatest cause for present fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
With eyes of Argus, Pepin&#8217;s valiant son,<BR>
Where Agramant was bent to storm foresaw,<BR>
And every thing forestalled, ere yet begun<BR>
By the bold followers of Mahound&#8217;s law.<BR>
With Isolier, Grandonio, Falsiron,<BR>
Serpentin, Balugantes, and Ferrau,<BR>
And what beside he out of Spain had led,<BR>
Marsilius was in arms, their valiant head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
With old Sobrino, on the left of Seine,<BR>
Pulian and Dardinel d&#8217;Almontes meet,<BR>
With Oran&#8217;s giant king, to swell the train:<BR>
Six cubits is the prince, from head to feet.<BR>
But why move I my pen with greater pain<BR>
Than these men move their arms? for in his heat<BR>
King Rodomont exclaims, blaspheming sore,<BR>
Nor can contain his furious spirit more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
As swarming to assail the pastoral bowl,<BR>
With sound of stridulous wing, through summer sky,<BR>
Or relics of a feast, their luscious dole,<BR>
Repair the ready numbers of the fly;<BR>
As starlings to the vineyard&#8217;s crimsoning pole<BR>
With the ripe clusters charged,&#8212;heaven&#8217;s concave high<BR>
Filling, as they advanced, with noise and shout,<BR>
Fast hurried to the storm the Moorish rout.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
Upon their walls the Christians in array,<BR>
With lance, sword, axe, and wild-fire tost,<BR>
The assaulted city guard without dismay,<BR>
And little reck the proud barbarian&#8217;s boast:<BR>
Nor when death snatches this or that away,<BR>
Does any one in fear refuse his post.<BR>
Into the fosse below the paynim foes<BR>
Return, amid a storm of strokes and blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
Nor in this was is iron plied alone,<BR>
But mighty masses and whole bulwarks fall,<BR>
And top of tower, huge piece of bastion,<BR>
And with much toil disrupted, solid wall;<BR>
While streams of boiling water pouring down,<BR>
Insufferably the advancing paynims gall:<BR>
An ill-resisted rain, which, in despite<BR>
Of helmet, makes its way, and blinds the sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
And this than iron spear offended more:<BR>
Then how much more the mist of lime-dust fine!<BR>
Then how the emptied vessel, burning sore<BR>
With nitre, sulphur, pitch, and turpentine!<BR>
Nor idle lie the fiery hoops in store,<BR>
Which, wreathed about with flaming tresses, shine.<BR>
These at the foemen scaled, upon all hands,<BR>
Form cruel garlands for the paynim bands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile, up to the walls the second crew<BR>
Fierce Sarza&#8217;s king was driven, accompanied<BR>
By bold Orlando and Buraldo, who<BR>
The Garamantes and Marmonda guide;<BR>
Clarindo and Loridano; nor from view,<BR>
It seems, will Setta&#8217;s valiant monarch hide:<BR>
Morocco&#8217;s king and he of Cosco go<BR>
With these, that men their martial worth may know.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
With crimson Rodomont his banner stains,<BR>
And in the vermeil field a lion shows;<BR>
Who, bitted by a maid, to curb and reins<BR>
His savage mouth disdains not to unclose.<BR>
Himself in the submissive lion feigns<BR>
The haughty Rodomont, and would suppose<BR>
In her who curbs him with the bit and string,<BR>
Doralice, daughter to Grenada&#8217;s king;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
Whom Mandricardo took, as I before<BR>
Related, and from whom, and in what wise.<BR>
Even she it was, whom Sarza&#8217;s monarch more<BR>
Loved than his realm,&#8212;beyond his very eyes:<BR>
And valour showed for her and courteous lore,<BR>
Not knowing yet she was another&#8217;s prize.<BR>
If he had,&#8212;then,&#8212;then, first,&#8212;the story known,<BR>
Even what he did that day, he would have done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
At once the foes a thousand ladders rear.<BR>
Against the wall by the assailants shored,<BR>
Two mannered each round; the second, in the rear,<BR>
Urged on by the first; the third the second gored.<BR>
One mounts the wall through valour, one through fear,<BR>
And all attempt perforce the dangerous ford;<BR>
For cruel Rodomont of Argier slays<BR>
Or smites the wretched laggard who delays.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis thus, &#8217;mid fire and ruin, all assay<BR>
To mount the wall; but others to assure<BR>
Themselves, some safer passage seek, where they<BR>
Will have least pain and peril to endure.<BR>
Rodomont only scorns by any way<BR>
To wend, except by what is least secure;<BR>
And in that desperate case, where others made<BR>
Their offerings, cursed the god to whom they prayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
He in a cuirass, hard and strong, was drest;<BR>
A dragon-skin it was with scaly quilt,<BR>
Which erst secured the manly back and breast<BR>
Of his bold ancestor, that Babel built;<BR>
Who hoped the rule of heaven from God to wrest,<BR>
And him would from his golden dome have split.<BR>
Perfect, and for this end alone, were made<BR>
Helmet and shield as well as trenchant blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
Nor Rodomont to Nimrod yields in might,<BR>
Proud and untamed; and who would not forbear<BR>
To scale the lofty firmament till night,<BR>
Could he in this wide world descry the stair.<BR>
He stood not, he, to mark the bulwark&#8217;s plight<BR>
Nor if the fosse of certain bottom were.<BR>
He past, ran,&#8212;rather flew across the moat,<BR>
Plunging in filth and water to his throat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
Dripping and foul with water and with weeds,<BR>
&#8217;Mid fire and stone, and arbalests, and bows,<BR>
On drives the chief; as through the marshy reeds,<BR>
The wild-swine of our own Mallea goes;<BR>
Who makes large day-light wheresoe&#8217;er he speeds,<BR>
Parting the sedge with breast and tusk and nose.<BR>
The paynim, safe in buckler lifted high,<BR>
Scorns not the wall alone, but braves the sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
Rodomont has no sooner gained the shore,<BR>
Than on the wooden bartizan he stands,<BR>
Within the city walls, a bridge that bore<BR>
(Roomy and large) king Charles&#8217;s Christian bands.<BR>
Here many a scull is riven, here men take more<BR>
Than monkish tonsure at the warrior&#8217;s hands:<BR>
Heads fly and arms; and to the ditch a flood<BR>
Runs streaming from the wall of crimson blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
He drops the shield; and with two-handed sway<BR>
Wielding his sword, duke Arnulph he offends.<BR>
Who came from whence, into the briny bay,<BR>
The water of the rapid Rhine descends.<BR>
No better than the sulphur keeps away<BR>
The advancing flame, the wretch his life defends.<BR>
He his last shudder gives, and tumbles dead;<BR>
Cleft downwards, a full palm from neck and head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
At one back-stroke sir Spineloccio true,<BR>
Anselmo, Prando, and Oldrado fell;<BR>
The narrow place and thickly-swarming crew<BR>
Make the wide-circling blow so fully tell.<BR>
The first half Flemings were, the residue<BR>
Are Normans, who the list of slaughter swell.<BR>
Orghetto of Maganza, he from brow<BR>
To breast divides, and thence to paunch below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
Down from the wall Andropono and Moschine<BR>
He cast into the ditch: a priest the first;<BR>
The second, but a worshipper of wine,<BR>
Drained, at a draught, whole runlets in his thirst;<BR>
Aye wonted simple water to decline,<BR>
Like viper&#8217;s blood or venom: now immersed<BR>
In this, he perishes amid that slaughter;<BR>
And, what breeds most affliction, dies by water.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
Lewis the Provencal is cleft in two;<BR>
Arnold of Thoulouse through the breast before;<BR>
Hubert of Tours, sir Dionysius, Hugh,<BR>
And Claud, pour forth their ghosts in reeking gore.<BR>
Odo, Ambaldo, Satallon ensue,<BR>
And Walter next; of Paris are the four&#8212;<BR>
With others, that by me unmentioned fall,<BR>
Who cannot tell the name and land of all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
The crowd, by Rodomont of Sarza led,<BR>
The ladders lift, and many places scale.<BR>
Here the Parisians make no further head,<BR>
Who find their first defense of small avail<BR>
Full well they know that danger more to dread<BR>
Within awaits the foemen who assail;<BR>
Because between the wall and second mound<BR>
A fosse descends, wide, horrid, and profound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
Besides, that ours, with those upon the height,<BR>
War from below, like valiant men and stout,<BR>
New files succeed to those who fall in fight,<BR>
Where, on the interior summit, stand the rout,<BR>
Who gall with lances, and a whistling flight<BR>
Of darts, the mighty multitude without;<BR>
Many of whom, I ween, that post would shun,<BR>
If it were not for royal Ulien&#8217;s son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
But he still heartened some, and chid the rest,<BR>
And forced them forward to their sore alarm.<BR>
One paynim&#8217;s head he cleft, and other&#8217;s breast,<BR>
Who turned about to fly; and of the swarm<BR>
Some shoved and pushed and to the encounter prest,<BR>
Close-grappled by the collar, hair, or arm:<BR>
And downwards from the wall such numbers threw,<BR>
The ditch was all to narrow for the crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
While so the foes descend, or rather fling<BR>
Themselves into the perilous profound;<BR>
And thence by many ladders try to spring<BR>
Upon the summit of the second mound,<BR>
King Rodomont, as if he had a wing<BR>
Upon his every member, from the ground<BR>
Upraised his weight, and vaulted clean across,<BR>
Loaded with all his arms, the yawning fosse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
The moat of thirty feet, not less, he cleared,<BR>
As dexterously as leaps the greyhound fleet,<BR>
Nor at his lighting louder noise was heard<BR>
Than if he had worn felt beneath his feet.<BR>
He now of this, now that, the mantle sheared;<BR>
As though of pewter, not of iron beat,<BR>
Or rather of soft rind their arms had been:<BR>
So matchless was his force and sword so keen!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
This while, not idle, those of ours had laid<BR>
Snares in the inner moat, a well-charged mine:<BR>
Where broom and thick fascines, all over paid<BR>
With swarthy pitch, in plenty intertwine.<BR>
Though they from bank to bank that hollow line,<BR>
Filling the bottom well-nigh to the brink;<BR>
And countless vessels the defenders sink.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
Charged with salt-petre, oil, or sulphur pale,<BR>
One and the other, or with such like gear;<BR>
While ours, intent the paynims that assail<BR>
The town, should pay their daring folly dear,<BR>
(Who from the ditch on different parts would scale<BR>
The inner bulwark&#8217;s platform) when they hear<BR>
The appointed signal which their comrades raise,<BR>
Set, at fit points, the wildfire in a blaze.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
For that the moat was full from side to side,<BR>
The scattered flames united into one,<BR>
And mounted to such height, they well-nigh dried<BR>
The watery bosom of the moon; a dun<BR>
And dismal cloud above extending wide,<BR>
Dimmed every glimpse of light, and hid the sun:<BR>
A fearful crash, with a continued sound,<BR>
Like a long peal of thunder, shook the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
A horrid concert, a rude harmony<BR>
Of deep lament, and yell and shriek, which came<BR>
From those poor wretches in extremity,<BR>
Perishing through their furious leader&#8217;s blame,<BR>
Was heard, as in strange concord, to agree<BR>
With the fierce crackling of the murderous flame.<BR>
No more of this, no more!&#8212;Here, sir, I close<BR>
My canto, hoarse, and needing short repose.</TD></TR>
