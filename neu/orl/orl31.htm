Rinaldo and Dudon fight; then friendship make,<BR>
And to each other fitting honour pay.<BR>
Agramant&#8217;s host the united champions break,<BR>
And scatter it, like chaff, in disarray.<BR>
Brandimart wages war, for Roland&#8217;s sake,<BR>
With Rodomont, and loses in the fray.<BR>
This while, for good Bayardo, with more pain,<BR>
Contend Rinaldo and the Sericane.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
What sweeter, gladder, state could be possest<BR>
Than falls to the enamoured bosom&#8217;s share?<BR>
What happier mode of life, what lot more blest,<BR>
Than evermore the chains of love to wear?<BR>
Were not the lover, &#8217;mid his joys, distrest<BR>
By that suspicious fear, that cruel care,<BR>
That martyrdom, which racks the suffering sprite,<BR>
That phrensied rage, which jealousy is hight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
For by all bitters else which interpose<BR>
Before enjoyment of this choicest sweet,<BR>
Love is augmented, to perfection grows,<BR>
And takes a finer edge; to drink and eat,<BR>
Hunger and thirst the palate so dispose,<BR>
And flavour more our beverage and our meat.<BR>
Feebly that wight can estimate the charms<BR>
Of peace, who never knew the pain of arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
That which the heart aye sees, though undiscerned<BR>
Of human eye, we can support in peace.<BR>
To him long absent, to his love returned,<BR>
A longer absence is but joy&#8217;s increase.<BR>
Service may be endured, though nought is earned,<BR>
So that the hope of guerdon does not cease.<BR>
For worthy service in the end is paid,<BR>
Albeit its wages should be long delaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Scorn, and repulse, and finally each pain<BR>
Of suffering love, his every martyrdom,<BR>
Through recollection, make us entertain<BR>
Delights with greater rapture, when they come.<BR>
But if weak mind be poisoned by that bane,<BR>
That filthy pest, conceived in Stygian home,<BR>
Though joy ensue, with all its festive pleasures,<BR>
The wretched lover ill his comfort measures.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
This is that cruel and envenomed wound<BR>
Where neither salve nor portion soothes the smart;<BR>
Nor figure made by witch, nor murmured sound;<BR>
Nor star benign observed in friendly part;<BR>
Nor aught beside by Zoroaster found,<BR>
Inventor as he was of magic art.<BR>
Fell wound, which, more than every other woe,<BR>
Makes wretched man despair, and lays him low!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
O&#8217; cruel wound! incapable of cure,<BR>
Inflicted with such ease on lover&#8217;s breast,<BR>
No less by false suspicion than by sure!<BR>
O wound! whose pangs so wofully molest,<BR>
They reason and our better wit obscure,<BR>
And from it natural bent our judgment wrest:<BR>
Wound, which against all reason didst destroy<BR>
The damsel of Dordona&#8217;s every joy!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
I speak not of what fatal mischief wrought<BR>
Hippalca&#8217;s and the brother&#8217;s bitter blow;<BR>
I speak of fell and cruel tidings brought<BR>
Some few days after; for the former woe,<BR>
Weighed with this other, was a thing of nought:<BR>
This after some digression will I show:<BR>
But first Rinaldo&#8217;s feats I must declare,<BR>
Who with his troop to Paris made repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
The following day they met a cavalier,<BR>
Towards evening, with a lady by his side;<BR>
Sable his shield, and sable was his gear,<BR>
Whose ground a bar of silver did divide.<BR>
As foremost, and of seeming force, the peer,<BR>
Young Richardetto to the joust defend:<BR>
He, prompt for battle, wheeled his courser round,<BR>
And for the tourney took sufficient ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Between those knights no further parley past:<BR>
Without more question, charged the martial two.<BR>
Rinaldo with the friendly troop stood fast,<BR>
And looked to see what issue would ensue.<BR>
&#8220;Him from his saddle will I quickly cast,<BR>
If firm the footing, and mine arm prove true&#8221;;<BR>
Within himself young Richardetto cries:<BR>
But that encounter ends in other wise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Him underneath the vizor&#8217;s sight offends<BR>
The stranger champion, of the sable weed,<BR>
With force so fell, that he the youth extends<BR>
Above two lances&#8217; length beyond his steed.<BR>
Quickly to venge the knight Alardo wends,<BR>
But falls himself astounded on the mead;<BR>
Sore handled, and unhorsed by such a stroke,<BR>
His buckler in the cruel shock is broke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
His lance Guichardo levelled, when he spied<BR>
Outstretched upon the field, the brethren two;<BR>
Although &#8220;Halt, halt,&#8221; (renowned Rinaldo cried,)<BR>
&#8220;For this third course to me is justly due&#8221;:<BR>
But he as yet his helmet had not tied;<BR>
So that Guichardo to the combat flew.<BR>
He kept his seat no better than the twain;<BR>
Forthwith, like them, extended on the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
All to be foremost in the joust contend,<BR>
Richardo, Malagigi, Viviane:<BR>
But to their strife Rinaldo puts an end;<BR>
He shows himself in arms before the train,<BR>
Saying, &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis time that we to Paris wend;<BR>
For us too long the tourney will detain,<BR>
If I expect till each his course has run,<BR>
And ye are all unseated, one by one.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
So spake the knight, yet spake not in a tone<BR>
To be o&#8217;erheard in what he inly said;<BR>
Who thus foul scorn would to the rest have done.<BR>
Both now had wheeled, and fierce encounter made.<BR>
In the career Rinaldo was not thrown,<BR>
Who all the banded kinsmen much outweighed;<BR>
Their spears like brittle glass to pieces went,<BR>
But not an inch the champions backward bent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
The chargers such a rough encounter made,<BR>
That on his crupper sank each staggering horse:<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s rose so quick, he might be said<BR>
Scarcely to interrupt his rapid course:<BR>
The stranger&#8217;s broke his spine and shoulder-blade;<BR>
That other shocked him with such desperate force.<BR>
When his lord sees him slain, he leaves his seat,<BR>
And in an instant springs upon his feet;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
And to his foe, that having wheeled anew,<BR>
Approached with hand unarmed, the warrior cried:<BR>
&#8220;Sir, to the goodly courser whom ye slew,<BR>
Because, whenas he lived, he was my pride,<BR>
I deem, I ill should render honour due,<BR>
If thus unvenged by my good arm he died;<BR>
And so fall on, and do as best ye may,<BR>
For we parforce must meet in new assay.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
To him Rinaldo, &#8220;If we for thy horse<BR>
Have to contend in fight, and nought beside,<BR>
Take comfort, for I ween that with no worse<BR>
Thou, in his place, by me shalt be supplied.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Thou errest if thou deem&#8217;st his loss the source<BR>
Of my regret&#8221; (the stranger knight replied);<BR>
&#8220;But I, since thou divinest not my speech,<BR>
To thee my meaning will more plainly teach.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I should esteem it were a foul misdeed,<BR>
Unless I proved thee also with the brand.<BR>
I, if thou in this other dance succeed<BR>
Better or worse than me, would understand:<BR>
Then, as it please, afoot or on thy steed,<BR>
Attack me, so it be with arms in hand.<BR>
I am content all vantage to afford;<BR>
Such my desire to try thee with the sword!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Not long Rinaldo paused: he cried, &#8220;I plight<BR>
My promise not to balk thee of the fray;<BR>
And, for I deem thou art a valiant knight,<BR>
And lest thou umbrage take at mine array,<BR>
These shall go on before, nor other wight,<BR>
Beside a page, to hold my horse, shall stay.&#8221;<BR>
So spake Mount Alban&#8217;s lord; and to his band,<BR>
To wend their way the warrior gave command.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
To that king paladin with praise replied<BR>
The stranger peer; alighting on the plain,<BR>
Rinaldo to the valet, at his side,<BR>
Consigned the goodly steed Bayardo&#8217;s rein,<BR>
And when his banner he no longer spied,<BR>
Now widely distant with the warrior&#8217;s train,<BR>
His buckler braced, his biting faulchion drew,<BR>
And to the field defied the knight anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
And now each other they in fight assail:<BR>
Was never seen a feller strife in show.<BR>
Neither believes his foeman can avail,<BR>
Long, in that fierce debate, against his blow:<BR>
But when they knew, well neighed in doubtful scale,<BR>
That they were fitly matched, for weal or woe,<BR>
They laid their fury and their pride apart,<BR>
And for their vantage practised every art.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Their cruel and despiteous blows resound,<BR>
Re-echoing wide, what time the valiant twain<BR>
With cantlets of their shields now strew the ground,<BR>
Now with their faulchions sever plate and chain.<BR>
Yet more behoves to parry than to wound,<BR>
If either knight his footing would maintain;<BR>
For the first fault in fence, by either made,<BR>
Will with eternal mischief be appaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
One hour and more than half another, stood<BR>
The knights in battle; and the golden sun<BR>
Already was beneath the tumbling flood,<BR>
And the horizon veiled with darkness dun:<BR>
Nor yet had they reposed, nor interlude<BR>
Had been, since that despiteous fight begun,<BR>
&#8217;Twixt these, whom neither ire nor rancour warms,<BR>
But simple thirst of fame excites to arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo in himself revolving weighed<BR>
Who was the stranger knight, so passing stout;<BR>
That not alone him bravely had gainsaid,<BR>
But oft endangered in that deadly bout;<BR>
And has so harassed with his furious blade,<BR>
He of its final issue stands in doubt.<BR>
&#8212;He that the strife was ended would be fain,<BR>
So that his knightly honour took no stain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
The stranger knight, upon the other side,<BR>
As little of his valiant foeman knew;<BR>
Nor in that lord Mount Alban&#8217;s chief descried,<BR>
In warfare so renowned all countries through.<BR>
And upon whom, with such small cause defied,<BR>
His faulchion he in deadly combat drew.<BR>
He was assured he could not have in fight<BR>
Experience of a more redoubted wight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
He gladly would be quit of the emprize<BR>
He undertook to venge his courser&#8217;s fall;<BR>
And, could he, without blame, a mean devise,<BR>
Would fain withdraw from that disastrous brawl.<BR>
So overcast already were the skies,<BR>
Their cruel strokes well nigh fell harmless all.<BR>
Both blindly strike; more blindly yet those lords<BR>
Parry the stroke, who scarce discern their swords.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
He of Mount Alban is the first to say,<BR>
They should not combat darkling, on the plain;<BR>
But should their duel till such time delay<BR>
As slow Arcturus should have turned his wain.<BR>
(And adds,) as safely as himself might stay<BR>
The foe in his pavilion, of his train<BR>
As duly tended, honoured, and well seen,<BR>
As he in any place had ever been.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
To pray him has Rinaldo little need:<BR>
He courteously accepts him for his host;<BR>
And thither the united warriors speed,<BR>
Where lies Mount Alban&#8217;s troop in chosen post.<BR>
From his attendant squire a goodly steed,<BR>
With sumptuous housings gorgeously embossed,<BR>
Rinaldo takes, with tempered sword and spear,<BR>
And these bestows upon the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
For Montalbano&#8217;s lord the stranger guest,<BR>
The baron recognised, with whom he came;<BR>
Because, before they reached their place of rest,<BR>
The paladin had chanced himself to name;<BR>
And (for they brethren were) with love opprest,<BR>
His tenderness him wholly overcame;<BR>
And touched with kind affection, at his heart,<BR>
From his full eyes the tears of pleasure start.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Guido the savage was that cavalier,<BR>
Who, with Marphisa leagued, the martial maid,<BR>
Sansonet, and the sons of Olivier,<BR>
Long sailed the sea, as I erewhile have said;<BR>
From earlier meeting with his kindred dear<BR>
By Pinnabel, the felon knight, delaid;<BR>
Seized by that traitor, and by him detained,<BR>
To enforce the wicked law he had ordained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Sir Guido, when he knew his host to be<BR>
Rinaldo, famed above each famous knight,<BR>
Whom he had burned with more desire to see<BR>
Than ever blindman covets the lost light,<BR>
In rapture cries, &#8220;What fortune tempted me<BR>
With you, my lord, to strive in deadly fight,<BR>
Whom long I have beloved, and love, whose worth<BR>
I prize above all dwellers&#8217; upon earth?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Me on the distant bank of Euxine&#8217;s flood<BR>
(I Guido am yclept) Constantia bare,<BR>
Conceived of the illustrious seed and good<BR>
Of generous Aymon, as ye likewise are.<BR>
To visit you and my bold brotherhood<BR>
Is the occasion, hither I repair;<BR>
And, where to honour you I had in thought,<BR>
I see my coming has but mischief wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But that I neither ye nor the others knew,<BR>
Must for so foul a fault be my excuse;<BR>
And, if I can amend it, bid me do<BR>
Whate&#8217;er thou wilt, nor ought will I refuse.&#8221;<BR>
When, on this part and that, between the two,<BR>
Of interchanged embraces there was truce,<BR>
&#8220;Take you no farther thought upon your side<BR>
The battle to excuse,&#8221; Rinaldo cried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For in complete assurance that you are<BR>
A real offset of our ancient tree,<BR>
You could no better testimony bear<BR>
Than the tried valour which in you we see;<BR>
If your demeanour more pacific were,<BR>
We ill should have believed your ancestry:<BR>
Since neither lion from the doe proceeds,<BR>
Nor fearful pigeon, hawk or eagle breeds.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
While neither they through talk their journey stay,<BR>
Neither through speed abate their talk, those two<BR>
Reached the pavilions where the kinsmen lay:<BR>
There good Rinaldo, crying to his crew<BR>
That this was Guido, whom so many a day<BR>
They had impatiently desired to view,<BR>
Much pleased the friendly troop; and, at his sight<BR>
All like his father deemed the stranger knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
I will not tell what welcome to the peer<BR>
Made Richardet, Alardo, and those twain;<BR>
What Malagigi, what Sir Aldigier,<BR>
And gallant Vivian, of that kindred train;<BR>
What every captain, every cavalier;<BR>
What Guido spake, what they replied again:<BR>
I for conclusion of my tale will say,<BR>
He was well greeted of the whole array.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Ever, I deem, good Guido would have been<BR>
Dear to his brethren bold; but welcomed more<BR>
Was now the valiant knight, and better seen<BR>
That at another time, as needed sore.<BR>
When the sun, garlanded with radiance sheen,<BR>
Upraised his visage from the watery floor,<BR>
Sir Guido and his kinsmen, in a band,<BR>
Beneath Rinaldo&#8217;s banner took their stand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
So one day and another prick the train,<BR>
That they to Paris&#8217; leaguered gates are nigh,<BR>
Scarce ten miles distant, on the banks of Seine;<BR>
When, as good Fortune wills it, they descry<BR>
Gryphon and Aquilant, the two that stain<BR>
Their virtuous armour with a different dye;<BR>
Sable was Aquilant&#8217;s, white Gryphon&#8217;s, weed;<BR>
Good Olivier&#8217;s and Sigismonda&#8217;s seed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
In parley were they by a damsel stayed,<BR>
Nor she of mean condition to behold;<BR>
That in a snowy samyte was arraid,<BR>
The vesture edged about with list of gold:<BR>
Graceful and fair; although she was dismaid,<BR>
And down her visage tears of sorrow rolled;<BR>
Who with such mien and act her speech enforced,<BR>
It seemed of some high matter she discoursed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
As Guido them, they gallant Guido knew.<BR>
He with the pair had been few days before;<BR>
And to Rinaldo: &#8220;Behold those! whom few<BR>
In valour and in prowess go before,<BR>
And if they join your banner, against you<BR>
Feebly will stand the squadrons of the Moor.&#8221;<BR>
Rinaldo vouched what valiant Guido told,<BR>
How either champion was a warrior bold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Nor them he less had recognized at sight;<BR>
Because (such was the usage of the pair)<BR>
One by a vest all black, and one all white,<BR>
He knows, and by the ornaments they wear.<BR>
The brethren know as well Mount Alban&#8217;s knight,<BR>
And give the warlike kinsmen welcome fair:<BR>
They both embrace Rinaldo as a friend,<BR>
And of their ancient quarrel make an end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
They&#8212;erst at feud and with sore hate possest,<BR>
Through Truffaldino&#8212;(which were long to say)<BR>
Each other with fraternal love carest,<BR>
Now putting all their enmity away.<BR>
Rinaldo next Sir Sansonet addrest,<BR>
Who somewhat later joined that fair array;<BR>
And (knowing well his force and mighty thew)<BR>
Received the cavalier with honour due.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
When she, that gentle damsel, now more near,<BR>
Beholds renowned Rinaldo, him she knows,<BR>
Acquainted with each paladin and peer.<BR>
She news which sorely grieve the warrior shows;<BR>
And thus begin: &#8220;My lord, your cousin dear,<BR>
To whom its safety Church and Empire owes,<BR>
Roland, erewhile so honoured and so sage,<BR>
Now roves the world, possest with frantic rage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whence woe, so direful and so strange, ensued<BR>
Cannot by me to you be signified:<BR>
I saw on earth his sword and armour strewed,<BR>
Doffed by that peer, and scattered far and wide;<BR>
And I a pious knight and courteous viewed<BR>
Those arms collecting upon every side,<BR>
Who, in the guise of trophy, to a tree<BR>
Fastened that fair and pompous panoply.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But from the trophied stem the sword withdrew<BR>
The son of Agrican that very day.<BR>
Thou mayst conceive what mischief may ensue<BR>
To Charles and to the christened host&#8217;s array,<BR>
From loss of Durindana, if anew<BR>
The infidels that goodly blade should sway.<BR>
Good Brigliador as well, who roved, forsaken,<BR>
About those arms, was by the paynim taken.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Few days are past, since I in shameful wise<BR>
Saw Roland, running naked in his mood,<BR>
Sending forth piteous shrieks and fearful cries.<BR>
In fine, that he is frantic I conclude;<BR>
Nor this had I believed, save with these eyes<BR>
That strange and cruel wonder I had viewed.&#8221;<BR>
She added next, how from the bridge&#8217;s top,<BR>
Embraced by Rodomont, she saw him drop.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To whosoe&#8217;er I deem not Roland&#8217;s foe<BR>
I tell my tale,&#8221; (pursued the dame again,)<BR>
&#8220;That, of the crowd who hear this cruel woe<BR>
Some one, in pity to his cruel pain,<BR>
May strive the peer in Paris to bestow,<BR>
Or other friendly place, to purge his brain.<BR>
Well wot I, if such tidings he receive,<BR>
Nought unattempted Brandimart will leave.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Fair Flordelice was she, the stranger dame;<BR>
That his own self to Brandimart more dear:<BR>
Who in pursuit of him to Paris came.<BR>
That damsel, after, tells the cavalier,<BR>
How hate and strife were blown into a flame<BR>
Between Gradasso and the Tartar peer,<BR>
For Roland&#8217;s faulchion; fierce Gradasso&#8217;s prey,<BR>
When slain in combat Mandricardo lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
By accident, so strange and sad, distrust,<BR>
Rinaldo is distraught with ceaseless woe:<BR>
He feels his heart dissolve within his breast,<BR>
As in the sun dissolves the flake of snow;<BR>
And, with unchanged resolve, upon the quest<BR>
Of good Orlando, every where will go;<BR>
In hopes, if he discover him, to find<BR>
Some means of cure for his distempered mind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
But since his band already had he dight,<BR>
(Did him the hand of Heaven or Fortune sway)<BR>
He first to put the Saracens to flight,<BR>
And raise the siege of Paris, will assay.<BR>
But (for it promised vantage) he till night<BR>
The assault of their cantonments will delay,<BR>
Till the third watch or fourth, when heavy sleep<BR>
Their senses shall in Lethe&#8217;s water steep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
His squadron in the wood he placed, and there,<BR>
Ambushed, he made them lie the daylight through;<BR>
But when the sun, leaving this nether air<BR>
In darkness, to his ancient nurse withdrew;<BR>
And fangless serpent now, and goat, and bear,<BR>
With other beasts, adorned the heavens anew,<BR>
Which by the greater blaze had been concealed,<BR>
Rinaldo moved his silent troop afield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
A mile an-end with Aquilant he prest,<BR>
Gryphon, Alardo, and Vivian of his race,<BR>
Guido and Sansonetto, and the rest,<BR>
Without word spoken, and with stealthy pace.<BR>
The Moorish guard they find with sleep opprest:<BR>
They slaughter all, nor grant one paynim grace;<BR>
And, ere they were by others seen or heard,<BR>
Into their midmost camp the squadron spurred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
At the first charge on that unchristened band,<BR>
Their guard and sentries, taken by surprise,<BR>
So broken are by good Rinaldo&#8217;s brand,<BR>
No wight is left, save he who slaughtered lies.<BR>
Their first post forced, the paynims understand<BR>
No laughing matter is the lord&#8217;s emprize;<BR>
For. sleeping and dismaid, their naked swarms<BR>
Make small resistance to such warriors&#8217; arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
To strike more dread into the Moorish foe,<BR>
Mount Alban&#8217;s champion, leading the assault,<BR>
Bade beat his drums and bade his bugles blow,<BR>
And with loud echoing cries his name exalt.<BR>
He spurs Bayardo, that is nothing slow;<BR>
He clears the lofty barriers at a vault,<BR>
Trampling down foot, o&#8217;erturning cavalier,<BR>
And scatters booth and tent in his career.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Is none so bold of all that paynimry<BR>
But what his stiffened hair stands up on end,<BR>
Hearing Mount Alban&#8217;s and Rinaldo&#8217;s cry<BR>
From earth into the starry vault ascend.<BR>
Him the twin hosts of Spain and Afric fly,<BR>
Nor time in loading baggage idly spend;<BR>
Who will not wait that deadly fury more,<BR>
Which to have proved so deeply irks them sore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Guido succeeds; no less their foe pursue,<BR>
The valiant sons of warlike Olivier,<BR>
Alardo, Richardet, and the other two;<BR>
Sansonet&#8217;s sword and horse a pathway clear;<BR>
And well is proved upon that paynim crew<BR>
The force of Vivian and of Aldigier.<BR>
Thus each bestirs himself like valorous knight,<BR>
Who follows Clermont&#8217;s banner to the fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Seven hundred men with good Rinaldo speed,<BR>
Drawn from Mount Alban and the townships nigh<BR>
&#8212;No fiercer erst obeyed Achilles&#8217; lead&#8212;<BR>
Enured to summer and to winter sky:<BR>
So stout each warrior is, so good at need,<BR>
A hundred would not from a thousand fly;<BR>
And, better than some famous cavaliers,<BR>
Many amid that squadron couch their spears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
If good Rinaldo gathers small supplies<BR>
From rents or cities, which his rule obey,<BR>
So these he bound by words and courtesies,<BR>
And sharing what he had with his array,<BR>
Is none that ever from his service buys<BR>
Deserter by the bribe of better pay.<BR>
Of Montalbano these are left in care,<BR>
Save pressing need demands their aid elsewhere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Them now in succour of King Charles he stirred,<BR>
And left with little guard his citadel.<BR>
Among the Africans that squadron spurred,<BR>
That squadron, of whose doughty feats I tell,<BR>
Doing by them what wolf on woolly herd<BR>
Does where Galesus&#8217; limpid waters well,<BR>
Or lion by the bearded goat and rank,<BR>
That feeds on Cinyphus&#8217;s barbarous bank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
Tidings to Charles Rinaldo had conveyed,<BR>
That he for Paris with his squadron steers,<BR>
To assail, by night, the paynims ill purveyed;<BR>
And ready and in arms the king appears.<BR>
He, when his help is needed, comes in aid,<BR>
With all his peerage, and, beside his peers,<BR>
Brings Monodantes&#8217; son, amid that crew,<BR>
Of Flordelice the lover chaste and true;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Whom by such long and by such tedious way<BR>
She sought throughout the realm of France in vain;<BR>
Here by the cognizance, his old display,<BR>
Afar, by her distinguished from the train.<BR>
At the first sight of her he quits the fray,<BR>
And wears a semblance loving and humane.<BR>
He clipt her round with many a fond caress,<BR>
And kissed a thousand times, or little less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
To dame and damsel in that ancient age<BR>
They trusted much, that, in their wandering vein,<BR>
Roved, unescorted, many a weary stage,<BR>
Through foreign countries and by hill and plain;<BR>
Whom they returning hold for fair and sage,<BR>
Nor of their faith suspicion entertain.<BR>
Here Brandimart by Flordelice was taught<BR>
How Roland wandered, of his wits distraught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Had he such strange and evil tidings heard<BR>
From other lips, he scarce had these believed:<BR>
But credited fair Flordelice&#8217;s word,<BR>
From whom more wondrous things he had received,<BR>
Nor this, as told by other, she averred;<BR>
This had she seen, and ill could be deceived;<BR>
For well as any she Orlando knows;<BR>
And both the when and where that damsel shows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
She tells him how the perilous bridge&#8217;s floor<BR>
From cavaliers king Rodomont defends;<BR>
Where, on a pompous sepulchre, the Moor<BR>
His prisoners&#8217; ravished arms and vest suspends;<BR>
Tells how she saw Orlando, raging sore,<BR>
Do fearful deeds, and her relation ends,<BR>
Describing how the paynim fell reversed,<BR>
To his great peril, in the stream immersed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Brandimart, who the Country loves as dear<BR>
As man can love a brother, friend, or son,<BR>
Disposed to seek Orlando, far and near,<BR>
Nor pain nor peril in the adventure shun,<BR>
Till something for the comfort of that peer<BR>
By wizard&#8217;s or by leech&#8217;s art be done,<BR>
Armed as he is, leaps lightly on his steed,<BR>
And takes his way beneath the lady&#8217;s lead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Thitherward were Orlando she had spied,<BR>
In company the knight and lady made.<BR>
They daily post till to that bridge they ride,<BR>
Which Argier&#8217;s king maintained, in arms arraid,<BR>
To him the guard their coming signified;<BR>
Courser and arms his squires as well conveyed;<BR>
And Brandimart no sooner is at hand<BR>
Than Rodomont is armed and at his stand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
With lofty voice the sovereign of Argier,<BR>
Assorting with his moody rage, &#8217;gan say:<BR>
&#8220;&#8212;Whoe&#8217;er thou art, sir knight, and whencesoe&#8217;er&#8212;<BR>
Brought by mistake of purpose or of way,<BR>
Light from thine horse and doff thy warlike gear,<BR>
To deck this sepulchre, ere thee I slay,<BR>
An offering to its lovely tenant&#8217;s spirit;<BR>
And thou in thy forced homage have no merit.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Brandimart, at the paynim&#8217;s proud discourse,<BR>
His weapon in the rest, for answer, layed;<BR>
He good Batoldo spurred, his gentle horse,<BR>
And at the champion with such fury made,<BR>
As showed that he, for courage and for force,<BR>
With any warrior in the world had weighed.<BR>
King Rodomont as well, with rested spear,<BR>
Thundered along the bridge, in fierce career.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
The paynim&#8217;s courser, ever used to go<BR>
Upon that bridge&#8217;s fearful pass, where one<BR>
Fell prone parforce into the stream below,<BR>
Securely to the fierce encounter run:<BR>
While, trembling, and irresolute in show,<BR>
That other to the unwonted course is gone.<BR>
Quivers the bridge beneath, as it would sink:<BR>
Narrow that passage is, unfenced the brink!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
With heavy spears, the growth of forest hoar,<BR>
Saplings rough-hewn, those masters of the just,<BR>
Upon the perilous bridge encountering sore,<BR>
Exchange, on either side, no gentle thrust.<BR>
Nor much their mighty strength or manege-lore<BR>
Avails the steeds; for, prostrate in the dust,<BR>
Crumbles each knight and charger in mid-course;<BR>
Whelmed in one fate, the rider and his horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
When either steed would nimbly spring from ground,<BR>
As the spur galled and gored his bleeding flank,<BR>
He on that little bridge no footing found;<BR>
For all to narrow was the scanty plank.<BR>
Hence both fall headlong, and the deafening sound<BR>
Re-echo vaulted skies and grassy bank.<BR>
So rang our stream, when from the heavenly sphere<BR>
Was hurled the sun&#8217;s ill-fated charioteer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
With all their weight, down hurtled from the steep,<BR>
Coursers and cavaliers, who sate them well;<BR>
And dived into the river&#8217;s darksome deep,<BR>
To search for beauteous nymph in secret cell.<BR>
Nor this the first nor yet the second leap<BR>
Which from the bridge had made that infidel!<BR>
Who, often floundering in its oozy bed,<BR>
Well in the soundings of that stream was read.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
He where &#8217;tis hand and where &#8217;tis softer knows,<BR>
Where shallow is the water, where profound:<BR>
With breast and flanks above the waves he rose,<BR>
And Brandimart assailed on safer ground.<BR>
Brandimart, whirling with the current, goes,<BR>
While his steed&#8217;s feet the faithless bottom pound.<BR>
He, with his lord, stands rooted in the mud,<BR>
With risk to both of drowning in the flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Whelming them upside-down, the waters flow,<BR>
And plunge them in the river&#8217;s deepest bed;<BR>
The horse is uppermost, the knight below.<BR>
From the bridge looks his lady, sore bested,<BR>
And tear employs, and prayer, and suppliant vow:<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Ah, Rodomont! for love of her, whom dead<BR>
Ye worship, do not deed of such despite!<BR>
Permit not, sir, the death of such a knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! courteous lord! if e&#8217;er you loved withal,<BR>
Have pity upon me who love this peer;<BR>
Let it suffice that he become thy thrall!<BR>
For if thou on this stone suspend his gear,<BR>
Amid whatever spoils adorn the wall,<BR>
The best and worthiest will his spoils appear.&#8221;<BR>
She ended, and her prayer so well addrest,<BR>
It touched, though hard to move, the paynim&#8217;s breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Moved by her words, he lent her lover aid,<BR>
So by his courser in the stream immersed;<BR>
And largely drank, albeit with little thirst.<BR>
But Rodomont a while his help delayed,<BR>
And seized the warrior&#8217;s sword and helmet first.<BR>
Him half exhausted from the stream he drew,<BR>
And prisoned with that other captive crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
All happiness was in that damsel spent,<BR>
When taken she her Brandimart espied,<BR>
Although to see him captive more content,<BR>
Than to behold him perish in the tide.<BR>
None but herself she blames for the event,<BR>
Who thitherward had been the champion&#8217;s guide,<BR>
She having to that faithful warrior shown,<BR>
How at the bridge Orlando she had known.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
She parts, and has anew already planned<BR>
Thither with good Rinaldo to resort;<BR>
With Guido, Sansonet of doughty hand,<BR>
Or other cavalier of Pepin&#8217;s court;<BR>
Some warrior good by water and by land,<BR>
That with the Saracen will well assort.<BR>
Who, if no stronger than her baffled knight,<BR>
With better fortune may maintain the fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
For many days the damsel vainly strayed,<BR>
Ere she encountered any one who bore<BR>
Semblance of knight, that might afford her aid,<BR>
And free her prisoned lover from the Moor;<BR>
After she long and fruitless search had made,<BR>
At length a warrior crost her way, that wore<BR>
A richly ornamented vest, whose ground<BR>
With trunks of cypresses was broidered round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Who was that champion, shall be said elsewhere;<BR>
For I to Paris must return, and show<BR>
How Malagigi and Rinaldo are<BR>
Victorious o&#8217;er the routed Moorish foe.<BR>
To count the flyers were a useless care,<BR>
Or many drowned in Stygian streams below.<BR>
The darkness rendered Turpin&#8217;s labour vain,<BR>
Who tasked himself to tell the pagans slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
King Agramant in his pavilion lies,<BR>
From his first sleep awakened by a knight:<BR>
He that the king will be a prisoner cries,<BR>
Save he with speed betake himself to flight,<BR>
The monarch looks about him and espies<BR>
His paynim bands dispersed in panic fright.<BR>
Naked, they far and near desert the field;<BR>
Nay, never halt to snatch the covering shield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Uncounselled and confused, the king arrayed<BR>
His naked limbs in knightly plate and chain,<BR>
When thither Falsiron, the Spaniard, made<BR>
Grandonio, Balugantes, and their train:<BR>
They to the Moorish king the risk displayed<BR>
Of being taken in that press, or slain;<BR>
And vouched if thence he should in safety fare,<BR>
He well might thank propitious Fortune&#8217;s care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Marsilius so, Sobrino so, their fear<BR>
Express; so, one and all, the friendly band;<BR>
They warn him that Destruction is as near<BR>
As swift Mount Alban&#8217;s lord is nigh at hand.<BR>
And if against so fierce a cavalier,<BR>
And such a troop, he seeks to make a stand,<BR>
He and his friends in that disastrous strife<BR>
Will surely forfeit liberty or life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
But he to Arles and Narbonne may retreat,<BR>
With such few squadrons as his rule obey:<BR>
Since either is well fortified, and meet<BR>
The warfare to maintain above one day;<BR>
And having saved his person, the defeat<BR>
May venge upon the foe, by this delay:<BR>
His troops may rally quickly in that post,<BR>
And rout in fine King Charles&#8217; conquering host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Agramant to those lords&#8217; opinion bent,<BR>
Though that hard counsel he could ill endure;<BR>
As if supplied with wings, towards Arles he went,<BR>
By roads which offered passage most secure.<BR>
Beside safe guides, much favoured his intent<BR>
His setting out, when all things were obscure.<BR>
Scaping the toils by good Rinaldo spread,<BR>
Some twenty thousand of the paynims fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Those whom Rinaldo, whom his brethren slew,<BR>
Whom Oliviero&#8217;s sons, the valiant twain,<BR>
Those who were slaughtered by Mount Alban&#8217;s crew,<BR>
&#8212;The fierce seven hundred, good Rinaldo&#8217;s train&#8212;<BR>
Those whom the valiant Sansonet o&#8217;erthrew,<BR>
And those that in their flight were drowned in Seine,<BR>
He who would count, might count as well what flowers<BR>
Zephyr and Flora shed, mid April-showers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Here one conjectures Malagigi bore<BR>
A part in the alarum of that night:<BR>
Not that he stained the mead with paynim gore,<BR>
Nor splintered heads; but that the wizard wight,<BR>
Infernal angels, by his magic lore,<BR>
Called from Tartarean caverns into light;<BR>
Whose many spears and banners waving wide<BR>
Two kingdoms such as France had scarce supplied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
And with them such sonorous metal brayed,<BR>
So many drums and martial noises sounded;<BR>
So many steeds in that encounter neighed;<BR>
So many cries&#8212;with rush of foot confounded&#8212;<BR>
Rose all about, that hill, dale, wood, and glade,<BR>
From distant parts, the deafening din rebounded;<BR>
And struck into the Moors such sudden dread,<BR>
They turned and from the field in panic fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Their king forgets no, how Rogero lay<BR>
Sore wounded, and as yet in evil case.<BR>
Him, with what care they could, he made convey<BR>
From that dread field, on horse of easy pace.<BR>
Borne to the sea by the securest way,<BR>
They in a bark the suffering warrior place,<BR>
And thence commodiously to Arles transport;<BR>
Whither their wasted squadrons make resort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Chased by Rinaldo and King Charlemagne,<BR>
A hundred thousand, or well nigh, I ween,<BR>
By wood, by mountain, valley, and by plain,<BR>
Flying the fury of the Franks are seen;<BR>
More find the passage blocked, and widely stain<BR>
With crimson what before was white and green.<BR>
Not so Gradasso&#8217;s puissant troops was spent,<BR>
Who farther from the field had pitched his tent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Nay; when he hears it is Mount Alban&#8217;s knight<BR>
By whom assailed the paynim quarters are,<BR>
He in his heart exults, with such delight,<BR>
That he, for very joy, leaps here and there.<BR>
He thanks and lauds his God, who him that night<BR>
Blest with so high a fortune and so rare;<BR>
Hoping to win the horse without a peer,<BR>
Bayardo, from the Christian cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Gradasso had desired long time before<BR>
(I think you will have read the tale elsewhere)<BR>
To back that courser, which Rinaldo bore,<BR>
And Durindana by his side to wear:<BR>
He with a hundred thousand men and more<BR>
To France, with this design, had made repair;<BR>
And had erewhile to bloody fight defied,<BR>
Even for that good steed, Mount Alban&#8217;s pride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Hence had that king repaired to the sea-shore,<BR>
The place assigned to end their discord fell:<BR>
But all was marred by Malagigi&#8217;s lore;<BR>
Who, cheating good Rinaldo with a spell,<BR>
To sea the champion in a pinnace bore.<BR>
Too tedious were the tale at length to tell.<BR>
Hence evermore Gradasso had opined,<BR>
The gentle baron was of craven kind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Now that Gradasso learns Mount Alban&#8217;s peer<BR>
Is he, that storms the camp, in huge delight,<BR>
Armed, on Alfana leaps the cavalier,<BR>
And through the pitchy darkness seeks the knight,<BR>
O&#8217;erturning all who cross his fierce career,<BR>
He leaves afflicted and in piteous plight<BR>
The broken bands of Afric and of France.<BR>
All, food alike for his wide-wasting lance.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
He seeks the paladin, now here now there,<BR>
Echoing his name as loud as he can shout;<BR>
And thitherward inclines his courser, where<BR>
The bodies are most thickly strown about.<BR>
At length encounter, sword to sword, the pair,<BR>
For broken are alike their lances stout;<BR>
Which shivering in their hands, had flown upright.<BR>
And smote the starry chariot of the Night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
When King Gradasso recognized the foe,<BR>
Not by the blazoned bearing of his shield,<BR>
But by Bayardo&#8212;by that horrid blow,<BR>
Which made him seem sole champion of the field,<BR>
He to reproach the knight was nothing slow,<BR>
And of unworthy action him appealed;<BR>
In that he had not kept his ground and day,<BR>
Erewhile appointed for the fierce assay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Belike thou hoped,&#8221; (said he of Sericane,)<BR>
&#8220;If for that time my vengeance thou couldst fly,<BR>
We should not meet in this wide world again:<BR>
But we are met, thou seest, anew; and I,<BR>
Be sure, though thou shouldst seek the Stygian reign,<BR>
Or be from earth translated to the sky,<BR>
Will hunt thee, save that courser thou forego,<BR>
Be it through heaven above or hell below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Dost thou, as matched with me mistrust thy force,<BR>
(And that thou wert ill paired was seen whilere,)<BR>
And more esteemest life than fame, a course<BR>
Remains, which thee may from thy peril clear.<BR>
And thou, if thou in peace resign the horse,<BR>
May&#8217;st live, if life be deemed so passing dear;<BR>
But live afoot, unmeriting a steed,<BR>
That dost by chivalry such foul misdeed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Guido the savage, as he spake, was nigh<BR>
With Richardetto; and the warlike twain<BR>
Brandished alike their trenchant swords on high,<BR>
To teach more wit to him of Sericane:<BR>
But them Rinaldo stopt with sudden cry,<BR>
Nor brooked that he should injury sustain.<BR>
&#8220;Am I too weak,&#8221; (he cried,) &#8220;without your aid,<BR>
To answer him that dares my deeds upbraid?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Then to the pagan thus: &#8220;Gradasso hear,<BR>
And wilt thou listen, thou shalt understand,<BR>
And I will prove it manifest and clear,<BR>
I came to seek thee out upon the strand;<BR>
And afterwards on thee will made appear<BR>
The truth of all I say with arms in hand;<BR>
Know then thou liest, if e&#8217;er with slanderous speech<BR>
Thou taxest me with aught in knighthood&#8217;s breach.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But warmly I beseech thee, that before<BR>
The battle be, thou fully comprehend<BR>
My just excuses, that thou may&#8217;st no more<BR>
Me for my failure wrongly reprehend:<BR>
Next for Bayardo, as agreed of yore,<BR>
&#8217;Tis my desire that we afoot contend;<BR>
Even as ordained by thee, in desert place,<BR>
Alone in knightly duel, face to face.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Courteous was Sericana&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
(For generous bosoms aye such practise use)<BR>
And is content to listen to the peer,<BR>
How he his breach of promise will excuse.<BR>
With him he seeks the river side, and here<BR>
In simple words what chanced Rinaldo shews;<BR>
Form the true history removes the veil,<BR>
And cites all Heaven to witness to his tale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Next calls upon the son of Buovo, who<BR>
Is of that history informed aright;<BR>
And now, from point to point, relates anew<BR>
(Nor more nor less rehearsed) the magic sleight.<BR>
When thus Rinaldo: &#8220;What I warrant true<BR>
By witness, I with arms in single fight,<BR>
For better proof, will vouch upon thy crest,<BR>
Both now and ever, as it likes thee best.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
The king of Sericane, as loath to leave<BR>
The second quarrel for the former breach,<BR>
Though doubtful how that tale he should receive,<BR>
Takes in good part the bold Rinaldo&#8217;s speech.<BR>
Not, as upon the former battle&#8217;s eve,<BR>
They choose their ground on Barcellona&#8217;s beach:<BR>
But on the morn ensuing, and, fast by<BR>
A neighbouring fountain, will the question try.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
Thither Rinaldo will the steed convey,<BR>
There to be placed in common, &#8217;twixt the two.<BR>
If good Gradasso take his foe or slay,<BR>
He wins Bayardo without more ado.<BR>
But if Gradasso fails in that affray,<BR>
&#8212;Should he be slain, or else for mercy sue,<BR>
A prisoner to Mount Alban&#8217;s valiant lord,<BR>
Rinaldo shall possess the virtuous sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
With mighty marvel and with greater pain,<BR>
The paladin from Flordelice (as shown)<BR>
Had heard how troubled was his cousin&#8217;s brain.<BR>
And from the damsel&#8217;s lips as well had known<BR>
How he his arms had scattered on the plain;<BR>
And heard the quarrel which from thence had grown;<BR>
In fine, how King Gradasso had the brand,<BR>
Which won such thousand palms in Roland&#8217;s hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
When they so agreed, Gradasso made<BR>
Thither where, camped apart, his servants lay,<BR>
Albeit warmly by Rinaldo prayed,<BR>
He would with him in his pavillion stay.<BR>
The paynim king in armour was arrayed,<BR>
And so the paladin, by break of day;<BR>
And to the destined fount came either lord,<BR>
The field of combat for the horse and sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
It seemed Rinaldo&#8217;s friends were all in fear,<BR>
And dreaded much, before it was begun,<BR>
The issue of the fight their cavalier<BR>
Should wage against Gradasso, one to one.<BR>
Much force, much daring, and much skill appear<BR>
In that fierce king; and since of Milo&#8217;s son<BR>
The goodly sword was to his girdle tied,<BR>
All cheeks looked pale upon Rinaldo&#8217;s side;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
And Malagigi, more than all the rest,<BR>
Sore doubted the event which would ensue,<BR>
He willingly himself would have addrest<BR>
To disappoint the destined fight anew;<BR>
But fears if he that deadly strife arrest,<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s utter enmity to rue,<BR>
Yet wroth with him upon that other score,<BR>
When he conveyed the warrior from the shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
Let others nourish idle grief and fears!<BR>
Rinaldo wends afield secure and gay,<BR>
Hoping that shame, which to the knight appears<BR>
Too foul to be endured, to wipe away:<BR>
So that of Altafoglia and Poictiers,<BR>
He may for ever silence the mis-say.<BR>
Boldly, and in his heart secure to win<BR>
That battle&#8217;s honour, wends the paladin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
When now from either side those warriors meet,<BR>
Nigh at the same time at the fountain-side,<BR>
So in all points the pair each other greet,<BR>
With countenance, so kind, so satisfied,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem by kindred and by friendship sweet<BR>
Rinaldo and Gradasso were allied.<BR>
But how they after closed in fierce affray,<BR>
I till another season shall delay.</TD></TR>
