<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Restored to sense, the beauteous Bradamant<BR>
Finds sage Melissa in the vaulted tomb,<BR>
And hears from her of many a famous plant<BR>
And warrior, who shall issue from her womb.<BR>
Next, to release Rogero from the haunt<BR>
Of old Atlantes, learns how from the groom,<BR>
Brunello hight, his virtuous ring to take;<BR>
And thus the knight&#8217;s and others&#8217; fetters break.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Who will vouchsafe me voice that shall ascend<BR>
As high as I would raise my noble theme?<BR>
Who will afford befitting words, and lend<BR>
Wings to my verse, to soar the pitch I scheme?<BR>
Since fiercer fire for such illustrious end,<BR>
Than what was wont, may well my song beseem.<BR>
For this fair portion to my lord is due<BR>
Which sings the sires from whom his lineage grew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Than whose fair line, &#8217;mid those by heavenly grace<BR>
Chosen to minister this earth below,<BR>
You see not, Ph&#339;bus, in your daily race,<BR>
One that in peace or war doth fairer show;<BR>
Nor lineage that hath longer kept its place;<BR>
And still shall keep it, if the lights which glow<BR>
Within me, but aright inspire my soul,<BR>
While the blue heaven shall turn about the pole.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
But should I seek at full its worth to blaze,<BR>
Not mine were needful, but that noble lyre<BR>
Which sounded at your touch the thunderer&#8217;s praise,<BR>
What time the giants sank in penal fire.<BR>
Yet should you instruments, more fit to raise<BR>
The votive work, bestow, as I desire,<BR>
All labour and all thought will I combine,<BR>
To shape and shadow forth the great design.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Till when, this chisel may suffice to scale<BR>
The stone, and give my lines a right direction;<BR>
And haply future study may avail,<BR>
To bring the stubborn labour to perfection.<BR>
Return we now to him, to whom the mail<BR>
Of hawberk, shield, and helm, were small protection:<BR>
I speak of Pinabel the Maganzeze,<BR>
Who hopes the damsel&#8217;s death, whose fall he sees.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The wily traitor thought that damsel sweet<BR>
Had perished on the darksome cavern&#8217;s floor,<BR>
And with pale visages hurried his retreat<BR>
From that, through him contaminated door.<BR>
And, thence returning, clomb into his seat:<BR>
Then, like one who a wicked spirit bore,<BR>
To add another sin to evil deed,<BR>
Bore off with him the warlike virgin&#8217;s steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Leave we sometime the wretch who, while he layed<BR>
Snares for another, wrought his proper doom;<BR>
And turn we to the damsel he betrayed,<BR>
Who had nigh found at once her death and tomb.<BR>
She, after rising from the rock, dismayed<BR>
At her shrewd fall, and gazing through the gloom,<BR>
Beheld and passed that inner door, which gave<BR>
Entrance to other and more spacious cave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
For the first cavern in a second ended,<BR>
Fashioned in form of church, and large and square;<BR>
With roof by cunning architect extended<BR>
On shafts of alabaster rich and rare.<BR>
The flame of a clear-burning lamp ascended<BR>
Before the central altar; and the glare,<BR>
Illuminating all the space about,<BR>
Shone through the gate, and lit the cave without.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Touched with the sanctifying thoughts which wait<BR>
On worthy spirit in a holy place,<BR>
She prays with eager lips, and heart elate,<BR>
To the Disposer of all earthly grace:<BR>
And, kneeling, hears a secret wicket grate<BR>
In the opposing wall; whence, face to face,<BR>
A woman issuing forth, the maid addresses,<BR>
Barefoot, ungirt, and with dishevelled tresses.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O generous Bradamant,&#8221; the matron cried,<BR>
&#8220;Know thine arrival in this hallowed hold<BR>
Was not unauthorized of heavenly guide:<BR>
And the prophetic ghost of Merlin told,<BR>
Thou to this cave shouldst come by path untried,<BR>
Which covers the renowned magician&#8217;s mould.<BR>
And here have I long time awaited thee,<BR>
To tell what is the heavens&#8217; pronounced decree.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This is the ancient memorable cave<BR>
Which Merlin, that enchanter sage, did make:<BR>
Thou may&#8217;st have heard how that magician brave<BR>
Was cheated by the Lady of the Lake.<BR>
Below, beneath the cavern, is the grave<BR>
Which holds his bones; where, for that lady&#8217;s sake,<BR>
His limbs (for such her will) the wizard spread.<BR>
Living he laid him there, and lies there dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet lives the spirit of immortal strain;<BR>
Lodged in the enchanter&#8217;s corpse, till to the skies<BR>
The trumpet call it, or to endless pain,<BR>
As it with dove or raven&#8217;s wing shall rise.<BR>
Yet lives the voice, and thou shalt hear how plain<BR>
From its sepulchral case of marble cries:<BR>
Since this has still the past and future taught<BR>
To every wight that has its counsel sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Long days have passed since I from distant land<BR>
My course did to this cemetery steer,<BR>
That in the solemn mysteries I scanned,<BR>
Merlin to me the truth should better clear;<BR>
And having compassed the design I planned,<BR>
A month beyond, for thee, have tarried here;<BR>
Since Merlin, still with certain knowledge summing<BR>
Events, prefixed this moment for thy coming.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
The daughter of Duke Aymon stood aghast,<BR>
And silent listened to the speech; while she<BR>
Knew not, sore marvelling at all that passed,<BR>
If &#8217;twere a dream or a reality.<BR>
At length, with modest brow, and eyes down cast,<BR>
Replied (like one that was all modesty),<BR>
&#8220;And is this wrought for me? and have I merit<BR>
Worthy the workings of prophetic spirit?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
And full of joy the adventure strange pursues,<BR>
Moving with ready haste behind the dame,<BR>
Who brings her to the sepulchre which mews<BR>
The bones and spirit, erst of Merlin&#8217;s name.<BR>
The tomb, of hardest stone which masons use,<BR>
Shone smooth and lucid, and as red as flame.<BR>
So that although no sun-beam pierced the gloom,<BR>
Its splendour lit the subterraneous room.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Whether it be the native operation<BR>
O certain stones, to shine like torch i&#8217; the dark,<BR>
Or whether force of spell or fumigation,<BR>
(A guess that seems to come more near the mark)<BR>
Or sign made under mystic constellation,<BR>
The blaze that came from the sepulchral ark<BR>
Discovered sculpture, colour, gems, and gilding,<BR>
And whatsoever else adorned the building.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Scarcely had Bradamant above the sill<BR>
Lifter her foot, and trod the secret cave,<BR>
When the live spirit, in clear tones that thrill,<BR>
Addressed the martial virgin from the grave;<BR>
&#8220;May Fortune, chaste and noble maid, fulfil<BR>
Thine every wish!&#8221; exclaimed the wizard brave.<BR>
&#8220;Since from thy womb a princely race shall spring,<BR>
Whose name through Italy and earth shall ring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The noble blood derived from ancient Troy,<BR>
Mingling in thee its two most glorious streams,<BR>
Shall be the ornament, and flower, and joy<BR>
Of every lineage on which Ph&#339;bus beams,<BR>
Where genial stars lend warmth, or cold annoy,<BR>
Where Indus, Tagus, Nile, or Danube gleams;<BR>
And in thy progeny and long drawn line<BR>
Shall marquises, counts, dukes and C&aelig;sers shine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Captains and cavaliers shall spring from thee,<BR>
Who both by knightly lance and prudent lore,<BR>
Shall once again to widowed Italy<BR>
Her ancient praise and fame in arms restore;<BR>
And in her realms just lords shall seated be,<BR>
(Such Numa and Augustus were of yore),<BR>
Who with their government, benign and sage,<BR>
Shall re-create on earth the golden age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then, that the will of Heaven be duly brought<BR>
To a fair end through thee, in fitting date,<BR>
Which from the first to bless thy love has wrought,<BR>
And destined young Rogero for thy mate,<BR>
Let nothing interpose to break that thought,<BR>
But boldly tread the path perscribed by fate;<BR>
Nor let aught stay thee till the thief be thrown<BR>
By thy good lance, who keeps thee from thine own.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Here Merlin ceased, that for the solemn feat<BR>
Melissa might prepare with fitting spell,<BR>
To show bold Bradamant, in aspect meet,<BR>
The heirs who her illustrious race should swell.<BR>
Hence many sprites she chose; but from what seat<BR>
Evoked, I know not, or if called from hell;<BR>
And gathered in one place (so bade the dame),<BR>
In various garb and guise the shadows came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
This done, into the church she called the maid,<BR>
Where she had drawn a magic ring, as wide<BR>
As might contain the damsel, prostrate laid;<BR>
With the full measure of a palm beside.<BR>
And on her head, lest spirit should invade,<BR>
A pentacle for more assurance tied.<BR>
So bade her hold her peace, and stand and look,<BR>
Then read, and schooled the demons from her book.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Lo! forth of that first cave what countless swarm<BR>
Presses upon the circle&#8217;s sacred round,<BR>
But, when they would the magic rampart storm,<BR>
Finds the way barred as if by fosse or mound;<BR>
Then back the rabble turns of various form;<BR>
And when it thrice with bending march has wound<BR>
About the circle, troops into the cave,<BR>
Where stands that beauteous urn, the wizard&#8217;s grave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To tell at large the puissant acts and worth,<BR>
And name of each who, figured in a sprite,<BR>
Is present to our eyes before his birth,&#8221;<BR>
Said sage Melissa to the damsel bright;<BR>
&#8220;To tell the deeds which they shall act on earth,<BR>
Were labour not to finish with the night.<BR>
Hence I shall call few worthies of thy line,<BR>
As time and fair occasion shall combine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;See yonder first-born of thy noble breed,<BR>
Who well reflects thy fair and joyous face;<BR>
He, first of thine and of Rogero&#8217;s seed,<BR>
Shall plant in Italy thy generous race.<BR>
In him behold who shall distain the mead,<BR>
And his good sword with blood of Pontier base;<BR>
The mighty wrong chastised, and traitor&#8217;s guilt,<BR>
By whom his princely father&#8217;s blood was spilt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By him King Desiderius shall be pressed,<BR>
The valiant leader of the Lombard horde:<BR>
And of the fiefs of Calaon and Este;<BR>
For this imperial Charles shall make him lord.<BR>
Hubert, thy grandson, comes behind; the best<BR>
Of Italy, with arms and belted sword:<BR>
Who shall defend the church from barbarous foes,<BR>
And more than once assure her safe repose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alberto next, unconquered captain, see,<BR>
Whose trophies shall so many fanes array.<BR>
Hugh, the bold son, is with the sire, and he<BR>
Shall conquer Milan, and the snakes display.<BR>
Azo, that next approaching form shall be,<BR>
And, his good brother dead, the Insubri sway.<BR>
Lo! Albertazo! by whose rede undone,<BR>
See Berengarius banished, and his son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With him shall the imperial Otho join<BR>
In wedlock worthily his daughter fair.<BR>
And lo! another Hugh! O noble line!<BR>
O! sire succeeded by an equal heir!<BR>
He, thwarting with just cause their ill design,<BR>
Shall thrash the Romans&#8217; pride who overbear;<BR>
Shall from their hands the sovereign pontiff take,<BR>
With the third Otho, and their leaguer break.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;See Fulke, who to his brother will convey<BR>
All his Italian birth-right, and command<BR>
To take a mighty dukedom far away<BR>
From his fair home, in Almayn&#8217;s northern land.<BR>
There he the house of Saxony shall stay,<BR>
And prop the ruin with his saving hand;<BR>
This in his mother&#8217;s right he shall possess,<BR>
And with his progeny maintain and bless.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;More famed for courtesy than warlike deed,<BR>
Azo the second, he who next repairs!<BR>
Bertoldo and Albertazo are his seed:<BR>
And, lo! the father walks between his heirs.<BR>
By Parma&#8217;s walls I see the Germans bleed,<BR>
Their second Henry quelled; such trophy bears<BR>
The one renowned in story&#8217;s future page:<BR>
The next shall wed Matilda, chaste and sage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His virtues shall deserve so fair a flower,<BR>
(And in his age, I wot, no common grace)<BR>
To hold the half of Italy in dower,<BR>
With that descendent of first Henry&#8217;s race.<BR>
Rinaldo shall succeed him in his power,<BR>
Pledge of Bertoldo&#8217;s wedded love, and chase<BR>
Fierce Frederick Barbarossa&#8217;s hireling bands,<BR>
Saving the church from his rapacious hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Another Azo rules Verona&#8217;s town,<BR>
With its fair fields; and two great chiefs this while<BR>
(One wears the papal, one the imperial crown),<BR>
The baron, Marquis of Ancona style.<BR>
But to show all who rear the gonfalon<BR>
Of the consistory, amid that file,<BR>
Were task too long; as long to tell each deed<BR>
Achieved for Rome by thy devoted seed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;See Fulke and Obyson, more Azos, Hughs!<BR>
Both Henrys!&#8212;mark the father and his boy.<BR>
Two Guelphs: the first fair Umbria&#8217;s land subdues,<BR>
And shall Spoleto&#8217;s ducal crown enjoy.<BR>
Behold the princely phantom that ensues,<BR>
Shall turn fair Italy&#8217;s long grief to joy;<BR>
I speak of the fifth Azo of thy strain,<BR>
By whom shall Ezelin be quelled and slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Fierce Ezelin, that most inhuman lord,<BR>
Who shall be deemed by men a child of hell.<BR>
And work such evil, thinning with the sword<BR>
Who in Ausonia&#8217;s wasted cities dwell;<BR>
Rome shall no more her Anthony record,<BR>
Her Marius, Sylla, Nero, Cajus fell.<BR>
And this fifth Azo shall to scathe and shame<BR>
Put Frederick, second C&aelig;ser of the name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, with his better sceptre well contented,<BR>
Shall rule the city, seated by the streams,<BR>
Where Ph&#339;bus to his plaintive lyre lamented<BR>
The son, ill-trusted with the father&#8217;s beams;<BR>
Where Cygnus spread his pinions, and the scented<BR>
Amber was wept, as fabling poet dreams.<BR>
To him such honour shall the church decree;<BR>
Fit guerdon of his works, and valour&#8217;s fee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But does no laurel for his brother twine,<BR>
Aldobrandino, who will carry cheer<BR>
To Rome (when Otho, with the Ghibelline,<BR>
Into the troubled capital strikes fear),<BR>
And make the Umbri and Piceni sign<BR>
Their shame, and sack the cities far and near;<BR>
Then hopeless to relieve the sacred hold,<BR>
Sue to the neighbouring Florentine for gold:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And trust a noble brother to his hands,<BR>
Boasting no dearer pledge, the pact to bind:<BR>
And next, victorious o&#8217;er the German bands,<BR>
Give his triumphant ensigns to the wind:<BR>
To the afflicted church restore her lands,<BR>
And take due vengeance of Celano&#8217;s kind.<BR>
Then die, cut off in manhood&#8217;s early flower,<BR>
Beneath the banners of the Papal power?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, dying, leaves his brother Azo heir<BR>
Of Pesaro and fair Ancona&#8217;s reign,<BR>
And all the cities which &#8217;twixt Tronto are,<BR>
And green Isauro&#8217;s stream, from mount to main;<BR>
With other heritage, more rich and rare,<BR>
Greatness of mind, and faith without a strain.<BR>
All else is Fortune&#8217;s in this mortal state;<BR>
But Virtue soars beyond her love and hate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In good Rinaldo equal worth shall shine,<BR>
(Such is the promise of his early fire)<BR>
If such a hope of thine exalted line.<BR>
Dark Fate and Fortune wreck not in their ire.<BR>
Alas! from Naples in this distant shrine,<BR>
Naples, where he is hostage for his sire,<BR>
His dirge is heard: A stripling of thy race,<BR>
Young Obyson, shall fill his grandsire&#8217;s place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This lord to his dominion shall unite<BR>
Gay Reggio, joined to Modena&#8217;s bold land.<BR>
And his redoubted valour lend such light,<BR>
The willing people call him to command.<BR>
Sixth of the name, his Azo rears upright<BR>
The church&#8217;s banner in his noble hand:<BR>
Fair Adria&#8217;s fief to him in dower shall bring<BR>
The child of second Charles, Sicilia&#8217;s king.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Behold in yonder friendly group agreed.<BR>
Many fair princes of illustrious name;<BR>
Obyson, Albert famed for pious deed,<BR>
Aldobrandino, Nicholas the lame.<BR>
But we may pass them by, for better speed,<BR>
Faenza conquered, and their feats and fame;<BR>
With Adria (better held and surer gain)<BR>
Which gives her title to the neighbouring main:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And that fair town, whose produce is the rose,<BR>
The rose which gives it name in Grecian speech:<BR>
That, too, which fishy marshes round enclose,<BR>
And Po&#8217;s two currents threat with double breach;<BR>
Whose townsmen loath the lazy calm&#8217;s repose,<BR>
And pray that stormy waves may lash the beach.<BR>
I pass, mid towns and towers, a countless store,<BR>
Argenta, Lugo, and a thousand more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;See Nicholas, whom in his tender age,<BR>
The willing people shall elect their lord;<BR>
He who shall laugh to scorn the civil rage<BR>
Of the rebellious Tideus and his horde;<BR>
Whose infantine delight shall be to wage<BR>
The mimic fight, and sweat with spear and sword:<BR>
And through the discipline such nurture yields,<BR>
Shall flourish as the flower of martial fields.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By him rebellious plans are overthrown,<BR>
And turned upon the rash contriver&#8217;s head;<BR>
And so each stratagem of warfare blown,<BR>
That vainly shall the cunning toils be spread.<BR>
To the third Otho this too late is known,<BR>
Of Parma and the pleasant Reggio dread;<BR>
Who shall by him be spoiled in sudden strife,<BR>
Of his possessions and his wretched life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And still the fair dominion shall increase,<BR>
And without wrong its spreading bounds augment;<BR>
Nor its glad subjects violate the peace,<BR>
Unless provoked some outrage to resent,<BR>
And hence its wealth and welfare shall not cease;<BR>
And the Divine Disposer be content<BR>
To let it flourish (such his heavenly love!)<BR>
While the celestial spheres revolve above.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! Lionel! lo! Borse great and kind!<BR>
First duke of thy fair race, his realm&#8217;s delight;<BR>
Who reigns secure, and shall more triumphs find<BR>
In peace, than warlike princes win in fight.<BR>
Who struggling Fury&#8217;s hands shall tie behind<BR>
Her back, and prison Mars, removed from sight.<BR>
His fair endeavours bent to bless and stay<BR>
The people, that his sovereign rule obey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! Hercules, who may reproach his neighbour,<BR>
With foot half burnt, and halting gait and slow,<BR>
That at Budrio, with protecting sabre,<BR>
He saved his troops from fatal overthrow;<BR>
Not that, for guerdon of his glorious labour,<BR>
He should distress and vex him as a foe;<BR>
Chased into Barco. It were hard to say,<BR>
If most he shine in peace or martial fray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lucania, Puglia, and Calabria&#8217;s strand,<BR>
Shall with the rumour of his prowess ring:<BR>
Where he shall strive in duel, hand to hand,<BR>
And gain the praise of Catalonia&#8217;s king.<BR>
Him, with the wisest captains of the land<BR>
His worth shall class; such fame his actions bring:<BR>
And he the fief shall win like valiant knight,<BR>
Which thirty years before was his of right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To him his grateful city owes a debt,<BR>
The greatest subjects to their lord can owe;<BR>
Not that he moves her from a marsh, to set<BR>
Her stones, where Ceres&#8217; fruitful treasures grow.<BR>
Nor that he shall enlarge her bounds, nor yet<BR>
That he shall fence her walls against the foe;<BR>
Nor that he theatre and dome repairs,<BR>
And beautifies her streets and goodly squares;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not that he keeps his lordship well defended<BR>
From the winged lions&#8217; claws and fierce attacks;<BR>
Nor that, when Gallic ravage is extended,<BR>
And the invader all Italia sacks,<BR>
His happy state alone is unoffended;<BR>
Unharassed, and ungalled by toll or tax.<BR>
Not for these blessings I recount, and more<BR>
His grateful realm shall Hercules adore;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So much as that from him shall spring a pair<BR>
Of brothers, leagued no less by love than blood;<BR>
Who shall be all that Leda&#8217;s children were;<BR>
The just Alphonso, Hippolite the good.<BR>
And as each twin resigned the vital air<BR>
His fellow to redeem from Stygian flood,<BR>
So each of these would gladly spend his breath,<BR>
And for his brother brave perpetual death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In these two princes&#8217; excellent affection,<BR>
Their happy lieges more assurance feel,<BR>
Than if their noble town, for its protection,<BR>
Were girded twice by Vulcan&#8217;s works of steel.<BR>
And so Alphonso in his good direction,<BR>
Justice, with knowledge and with love, shall deal,<BR>
Astrea shall appear returned from heaven,<BR>
To this low earth to varying seasons given.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Well is it that his wisdom shines as bright<BR>
As his good sire&#8217;s, nor is his valour less;<BR>
Since here usurping Venice arms for fight,<BR>
And her full troops his scanty numbers press,<BR>
There she (I know not if more justly hight<BR>
Mother or stepmother) brings new distress;<BR>
But, if a mother, scarce to him more mild<BR>
Than Progue or Medea to her child.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This chief, what time soever he shall go<BR>
Forth with his faithful crew, by night or day,<BR>
By water or by land, will shame the foe,<BR>
With memorable rout and disarray;<BR>
And this too late Romagna&#8217;s sons shall know.<BR>
Led against former friends in bloody fray,<BR>
Who shall bedew the campaign with their blood,<BR>
By Santern, Po, and Zaniolus&#8217; flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This shall the Spaniard know, to his dismay,<BR>
&#8217;Mid the same bounds, whom papal gold shall gain;<BR>
Who shall from him Bastia win and slay,<BR>
With cruel rage, her hapless Castellain,<BR>
The city taken; but shall dearly pay;<BR>
His crime, the town retrieved, and victor slain:<BR>
Since in the rescued city not a groom<BR>
Is left alive, to bear the news to Rome.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis he, who with his counsel and his lance,<BR>
Shall win the honours of Romagna&#8217;s plain,<BR>
And open to the chivalry of France<BR>
The victory over Julius, leagued with Spain.<BR>
Paunch-deep in human blood shall steeds advance<BR>
In that fierce strife, and struggle through the slain,<BR>
&#8217;Mid crowded fields, which scarce a grace supply,<BR>
Where Greek, Italian, Frank, and Spaniard die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! who in priestly vesture clad, is crowned<BR>
With purple hat, conferred in hallowed dome!<BR>
&#8217;Tis he, the wise, the liberal, the renowned<BR>
Hippolitus, great cardinal of Rome;<BR>
Whose actions shall in every region sound,<BR>
Where&#8217;er the honoured muse shall find a home:<BR>
To whose glad era, by indulgent heaven,<BR>
As to Augustus&#8217; is a Maro given.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His deeds adorn his race, as from his car<BR>
The glorious sun illumes the subject earth<BR>
More than the silver moon or lesser star;<BR>
So far all others he transcends in worth.<BR>
I see this captain, ill bested for war,<BR>
Go forth afflicted, and return in mirth:<BR>
Backed by few foot, and fewer cavaliers,<BR>
He homeward barks, and fifteen gallies steers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Two Sigismonds, the first, the second, see;<BR>
To these Alphonso&#8217;s five good sons succeed;<BR>
Whose glories spread o&#8217;er seas and land shall be.<BR>
The first shall wed a maid of France&#8217;s seed.<BR>
This is the second Hercules; and <I>he</I>,<BR>
(That you may know their every name and deed),<BR>
Hippolitus; who with the light shall shine,<BR>
Of his wise uncle, gilding all his line.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Francis the third comes next; the other two<BR>
Alphonsos both;&#8212;but yet again I say,<BR>
Thy line through all its branches to pursue,<BR>
Fair virgin, would too long protract thy stay;<BR>
And Ph&#339;bus, many times, to mortal view,<BR>
Would quench and light again the lamp of day.<BR>
Then, with thy leave, &#8217;tis time the pageant cease,<BR>
And I dismiss the shades and hold my peace.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
So with the lady&#8217;s leave the volume closed,<BR>
Whose precepts to her will the spirits bent.<BR>
And they, where Merlin&#8217;s ancient bones reposed,<BR>
From the first cavern disappearing, went.<BR>
Then Bradamant her eager lips unclosed,<BR>
Since the divine enchantress gave consent;<BR>
&#8220;And who,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;that pair of sorrowing mien,<BR>
Alphonso and Hippolitus between?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sighing, those youths advanced amid the show,<BR>
Their brows with shame and sorrow overcast,<BR>
With downward look, and gait subdued and slow:<BR>
I saw the brothers shun them as they passed.&#8221;<BR>
Melissa heard the dame with signs of woe,<BR>
And thus, with streaming eyes, exclaim&#8217;d at last:<BR>
&#8220;Ah! luckless youths, with vain illusions fed,<BR>
Whither by wicked men&#8217;s bad counsel led!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O, worthy seed of Hercules the good,<BR>
Let not their guilt beyond thy love prevail;<BR>
Alas! the wretched pair are of thy blood,<BR>
So many prevailing pity turn the scale!&#8221;<BR>
And in a sad and softer tone pursued,<BR>
&#8220;I will not further press the painful tale.<BR>
Chew on fair fancy&#8217;s food: Nor deem unmeet<BR>
I will not with a bitter chase the sweet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Soon as to-morrow&#8217;s sun shall gild the skies<BR>
With his first light, myself the way will show<BR>
To where the wizard knight Rogero sties;<BR>
And built with polished steel the ramparts glow:<BR>
So long as through deep woods thy journey lies,<BR>
Till, at the sea arrived, I shall bestow<BR>
Such new instructions for the future way,<BR>
That thou no more shalt need Melissa&#8217;s stay.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
All night the maid reposes in the cave,<BR>
And the best part in talk with Merlin spends;<BR>
While with persuasive voice the wizard grave<BR>
To her Rogero&#8217;s honest love commends;<BR>
Till from the vault goes forth that virgin brave,<BR>
As through the sky the rising sun ascends,<BR>
By path, long space obscure on either side,<BR>
The weird woman still her faithful guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
They gain a hidden glen, which heights inclose,<BR>
And mountains inaccessible to man:<BR>
And they all day toil on, without repose,<BR>
Where precipices frowned and torrents ran.<BR>
And (what may some diversion interpose)<BR>
Sweet subjects of discourse together scan,<BR>
In conference, which best might make appear<BR>
The rugged road less dismal and severe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Of these the greater portion served to guide<BR>
(Such the wise woman&#8217;s scope) the warlike dame;<BR>
And teach by what device might be untied<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s gyves, if stedfast were her flame.<BR>
&#8220;If thou wert Mars himself, or Pallas,&#8221; cried<BR>
The sage Melissa, &#8220;though with thee there came<BR>
More than King Charles or Agramant command,<BR>
Against the wizard foe thou could&#8217;st not stand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides that it is walled about with steel,<BR>
And inexpugnable his tower, and high;<BR>
Besides that his swift horse is taught to wheel,<BR>
And caracol and gallop in mid sky,<BR>
He bears a mortal shield of power to seal,<BR>
As soon as &#8217;tis exposed, the dazzled eye;<BR>
And so invades each sense, the splendour shed,<BR>
That he who sees the blaze remains as dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And lest to shut thine eyes, thou should&#8217;st suppose<BR>
Might serve, contending with the wizard knight;<BR>
How would&#8217;st thou know, when both in combat close,<BR>
When he strikes home, or when eschews the fight?<BR>
But to escape the blaze which blinds his foes,<BR>
And render vain each necromantic sleight,<BR>
Have here a speedy mean which cannot miss;<BR>
Nor can the world afford a way but this.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;King Agramant of Africa a ring,<BR>
Thieved from an Indian queen by subtle guiles,<BR>
Has to a baron of his following<BR>
Consigned, who now precedes us by few miles;<BR>
Brunello he. Who wears the gift shall bring<BR>
To nought all sorceries and magic wiles.<BR>
In thefts and cheats Brunello is as well<BR>
Instructed, as the sage in charm and spell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Brunello, he so practised and so sly<BR>
As now I tell thee, by his king is sent,<BR>
That he with aid of mother wit may try,<BR>
And of this ring, well proved in like event,<BR>
To take Rogero from the castle high;<BR>
So has he boasted, by the wizard pent:<BR>
And to his lord such promise did impart,<BR>
Who has Rogero&#8217;s presence most at heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That his escape to thee alone may owe,<BR>
Not to the king, the youthful cavalier,<BR>
How to release Rogero from his foe<BR>
And his enchanted cage, prepare to hear.<BR>
Three days along the shingle shalt thou go,<BR>
Beside the sea, whose waves will soon appear;<BR>
Thee the third day shall to a hostel bring,<BR>
Where he shall come who bears the virtuous ring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That thou may&#8217;st recognise the man, in height<BR>
Less than six palms, observe one at this inn<BR>
Of black and curly hair, the dwarfish wight!<BR>
Beard overgrown about the cheek and chin;<BR>
With shaggy brow, swoln eyes, and cloudy sight,<BR>
A nose close flattened, and a sallow skin;<BR>
To this, that I may make my sketch complete,<BR>
Succinctly clad, like courier, goes the cheat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thy conversation with this man shall turn<BR>
Upon enchantment, spell, and mystic pact:<BR>
And thou shalt, in thy talk, appear to yearn<BR>
To prove the wizard&#8217;s strength, as is the fact.<BR>
But, lady, let him not thy knowledge learn<BR>
Of his good ring, which mars all magic act:<BR>
He shall propose to bring thee as a guide<BR>
To the tall castle, whither thou would&#8217;st ride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Follow him close, and viewing (for a sign),<BR>
Now near, the fortress of the enchanter hoar;<BR>
Let no false pity there thy mind incline<BR>
To stay the execution of my lore.<BR>
Give him his death; but let him not divine<BR>
Thy thought, nor grant him respite; for before<BR>
Thine eyes, concealed by it, the caitiff slips<BR>
If once he place the ring between his lips.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Discoursing thus, they came upon the sea<BR>
Where Garonne near fair Bordeaux meets the tide;<BR>
Here, fellow travellers no more to be,<BR>
Some natural tears they drop and then divide.<BR>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s child, who slumbers not till she<BR>
Release her knight, holds on till even-tide:<BR>
&#8217;Twas then the damsel at a hostel rested,<BR>
Where Sir Brunello was already guested.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
The maid Brunello knows as soon as found<BR>
(So was his image on her mind impressed),<BR>
And asks him whence he came, and whither bound;<BR>
And he replies and lies, as he is pressed.<BR>
The dame, who is forewarned, and knows her ground,<BR>
Feigns too as well as he, and lies her best:<BR>
And changes sex and sect, and name and land,<BR>
And her quick eye oft glances at his hand;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Oft glances at his resless hand, in fear<BR>
That he might undetected make some prize;<BR>
Nor ever lets the knave approach too near,<BR>
Well knowing his condition: In this guise<BR>
The couple stand together, when they hear<BR>
A sudden sound: but what that sound implies<BR>
I, sir, shall tell hereafter with its cause;<BR>
But first shall break my song with fitting pause.</TD></TR>
