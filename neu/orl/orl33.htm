<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Bradamant sees in picture future fight<BR>
There, where she gained admission by the spear.<BR>
From combat cease, upon Bayardo&#8217;s flight,<BR>
Gradasso and Montalban&#8217;s cavalier.<BR>
While soaring through the world, the English knight<BR>
Arrives in Nubia&#8217;s distant realm, and here<BR>
Driving the Harpies from the royal board,<BR>
Hunts to the mouth of hell that impious horde.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Timagoras, Parrhasius, Polygnote,<BR>
Protogenes, renowned Apollodore,<BR>
Timanthes, and Apelles, first of note,<BR>
Zeuxis and others, famed heretofore,<BR>
Whose memory down the stream of Time will float,<BR>
While we their wreck and labours lost deplore,<BR>
Whose fame will flourish still in Fate&#8217;s despite,<BR>
(Grammercy authors!) while men read and write.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
And those, yet living or of earlier day,<BR>
Mantegna, Leonardo, Gian Belline,<BR>
The Dossi, and, skilled to carve or to pourtray,<BR>
Michael, less man than angel and divine,<BR>
Bastiano, Raphael, Titian, who (as they<BR>
Urbino and Venice) makes Cadoro shine;<BR>
With more, whose works resemble what he hear<BR>
And credit of those spirits, famed whilere;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
The painters we have seen, and others, who<BR>
Thousands of years ago in honour stood,<BR>
Things which had been with matchless pencil drew,<BR>
Some working upon wall, and some on wood.<BR>
But never, amid masters old or new,<BR>
Have ye of pictures heard or pictures viewed<BR>
Of things to come; yet such have been pourtrayed<BR>
Before the deeds were done which they displayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Yet let not artist whether new or old,<BR>
Boast of his skill such wondrous works to make;<BR>
But leave this feat to spell, wherewith controlled<BR>
The spirits of the infernal bottom quake.<BR>
The hall, whereof in other strain I told,<BR>
With volume sacred to Avernus&#8217; lake,<BR>
Or Norsine grot, throught subject Demons&#8217; might,<BR>
Was made by Merlin in a single night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
That art, whereby those ancient erst pourtrayed<BR>
Such wonders, is extinguished in our day.<BR>
But to the troop, by whom will be surveyed<BR>
The painted chamber, I return, and say;<BR>
A squire attendant on a signal made,<BR>
Bore thither lighted torches, by whose ray<BR>
Were scattered from that hall the shades of night,<BR>
Nor this in open day had shown more bright.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
When thus the castle&#8217;s lord addressed that crew:<BR>
&#8220;Know, of adventures in this chamber wrought,<BR>
Up to our days, have yet been witnessed few;<BR>
A warfare storied, but its fields unfought.<BR>
Who limned the battles, these as well foreknew.<BR>
Here of defeats to come and victories taught,<BR>
Whate&#8217;er in Italy our host befalls<BR>
You may discern as painted on these walls.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The wars, wherein French armies should appear,<BR>
Beyond the Alps, of foul event or fair,<BR>
Even from his days until the thousandth year,<BR>
By the prophetic Merlin painted were.<BR>
Hither Great Britain&#8217;s monarch sent the seer,<BR>
To him, that of King Marcomir was heir:<BR>
Why hither sent, and why this hall was made,<BR>
At the same time to you shall be displayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;King Pharamond, the first of those that passed<BR>
The Rhine, amid his Franks&#8217; victorious train,<BR>
When Gaul was won, bethought him how to cast<BR>
On restive Italy the curbing rein;<BR>
And this; that evermore he wasting fast<BR>
Beheld the Roman empire&#8217;s feeble reign;<BR>
And (for both reigned at once) would make accord,<BR>
To compass his design, with Britain&#8217;s lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The royal Arthur, by whom nought was done<BR>
Without the ripe advice of Merlin sage,<BR>
(Merlin, I say, the Devils mighty son,<BR>
Well versed in what should chance in future age,)<BR>
Knowing through him, to Pharamond made known,<BR>
He would in many woes his host engage,<BR>
Entering that region, which, with rugged mound,<BR>
Apennine parts, and Alp and sea surround.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To him sage Merlin shows, that well nigh all<BR>
Those other monarchs that in France will reign,<BR>
By murderous steel will see their people fall,<BR>
Consumed by famine, or by fever slain;<BR>
And that short joy, long sorrow, profit small,<BR>
And boundless ill shall recompense their pain;<BR>
Since vainly will the lily seek to shoot<BR>
In the Italian fields its withered root.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;King Pharamond so trusted to the seer<BR>
That he resolved to turn his arms elsewhere;<BR>
And Merlin, who beheld with sight as clear<BR>
The things to be, as things that whilom were,<BR>
&#8217;Tis said, was brought by magic art to rear<BR>
The painted chamber at the monarch&#8217;s prayer;<BR>
Wherein whatever deeds the Franks shall do,<BR>
As if already done, are plain to view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That king who should succeed, might comprehend,<BR>
As he renown and victory would obtain,<BR>
Whene&#8217;er his friendly squadrons should defend<BR>
From all barbarians else the Italian reign;<BR>
So, if to damage her he should descend,<BR>
Thinking to bind her with the griding chain,<BR>
&#8212;Might comprehend, I say, and read his doom&#8212;<BR>
How he beyond these hills should find a tomb.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
So said, he leads the listening ladies where<BR>
Those pictured histories begin; to show<BR>
How Sigisbert his arms will southward bear<BR>
For what imperial Maurice shall bestow.<BR>
&#8220;Behold him from the Mount of Jove repair<BR>
Thither where Ambra and Ticino flow!<BR>
Eutar behold, who not alone repels,<BR>
But puts the foe to flight, and routs and quells.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Where they with Clovis tread the mountain way,<BR>
More than a hundred thousand warriors trace;<BR>
See Benevento&#8217;s duke the monarch stay,<BR>
Whose thinner files his hostile army face.<BR>
Lo! these who feign retreat an ambush lay.<BR>
Lo! where through danger, havoc, and disgrace,<BR>
The Franks, who to the Lombard wine-fat hie,<BR>
Drugged by the bait, like poisoned mullets die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Where Childibert the boundary hills has crost,<BR>
Heading what bands of France and captains, see;<BR>
Yet shall no more than baffled Clovis boast<BR>
The conquest or the spoil of Lombardy.<BR>
Heaven&#8217;s sword descends so heavy on his host.<BR>
Choked with their bodies every road shall be;<BR>
So pined with watery flux and withering sun,<BR>
That, out of ten, unharmed returns not one.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
He shows King Pepin, shows King Charlemagne;<BR>
How into Italy their march they bend;<BR>
And one and the other fair success obtain,<BR>
Because her land they came not to offend.<BR>
But Stephen one, the other Adriane,<BR>
And, after, injured Leo, would defend.<BR>
This quells Astolpho, and that takes his heir,<BR>
And re-establishes the papal chair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
A youthful Pepin of the royal line<BR>
He after shows; who seemed to spread his host,<BR>
Even from THE KILNS to the Isle of Palestine;<BR>
And with a bridge, achieved at mighty cost,<BR>
At Malamocco, to bestride the brine,<BR>
And on Rialto&#8217;s shore his battle post.<BR>
Then fly and leave his drowning bands behind,<BR>
His bridge destroyed by wasting waves and wind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Burgundian Lewis ye behold descend<BR>
Thither with his invading squadrons, where,<BR>
Vanquishing and taken, nevermore to offend<BR>
With hostile arms, he is compelled to swear.<BR>
Behold! he slights his solemn oath&#8212;to wend,<BR>
Anew, with reckless steps, into the snare.<BR>
Lo! there he leaves his eyes; and his array,<BR>
Blind as the moldwarp, hence their lord convey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You see him named from Arles, victorious Hugh,<BR>
From Italy the Berengari chase!<BR>
Whom, quelled and broken twice and thrice, anew<BR>
Now the Bavarians, now the Huns, replace.<BR>
O&#8217;ermatched, he then for peace is fain to sue;<BR>
Nor long survives, nor he who fills his place;<BR>
To Berengarius yielding his domains,<BR>
Who, repossest of all his kingdom, reigns.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You see, her goodly pastor to sustain,<BR>
Another Charles set fire to Italy;<BR>
Who has two kings in two fierce battles slain,<BR>
Manfred and Conradine, and after see<BR>
His bands, who seem to vex the new-won reign<BR>
With many wrongs, and who dispersedly<BR>
&#8212;Some here, some there&#8212;in different cities dwell.<BR>
Slain on the rolling of the vesper-bell.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
He shows them next (but after interval,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem, of many and many an age, not years)<BR>
How through the Alps, a captain out of Gaul,<BR>
To war upon the great Viscontis, steers;<BR>
And seems to straiten Alexandria&#8217;s wall,<BR>
Girt with his forces, foot and cavaliers:<BR>
A garrison within, an ambuscade<BR>
Without the works, the warlike duke has laid;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
And the French host, decoyed in cunning wise<BR>
Thither where the surrounding toils are spread,<BR>
Conducted on that evil enterprise<BR>
By Armagnac, the Gallic squadron&#8217;s head,<BR>
Slaughtered throughout the spacious champaign lies,<BR>
Or is to Alexandria captive led:<BR>
While, swoln not more with water than with blood,<BR>
Tanarus purples wide Po&#8217;s ample flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Successively that castellain displayed<BR>
One hight of Marca, of the Anjouites three.<BR>
How &#8220;Marsi, Daunians, Salentines,&#8221; (he said)<BR>
&#8220;And Bruci, these shall oft molest, you see:<BR>
Yet not by Frank or Latian&#8217;s friendly aid<BR>
Shall one delivered from destruction be.<BR>
Lo! from the realm, as oft as they attack,<BR>
Alphonso and Gonsalvo beat them back.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You see the eighth Charles, amid his martial train,<BR>
The flower of France, through Alpine pass has pressed.<BR>
Who Liris fords, and takes all Naples&#8217; reign,<BR>
Yet draws not sword nor lays a lance in rest:<BR>
All, save that rock which&#8212;Typheus&#8217; endless pain&#8212;<BR>
Lies on the giant&#8217;s belly, arms, and breast:<BR>
By Inigo del Guasto here withstood,<BR>
Derived from Avalo&#8217;s illustrious blood.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
The warder of the castle, who makes clear<BR>
To beauteous Bradamant that history,<BR>
Says, having shown her Ischia&#8217;s island, &#8220;Ere<BR>
I lead you further other things to see,<BR>
I&#8217;ll tell what my great-grandfather whilere<BR>
&#8212;I then a child&#8212;was wont to tell to me.<BR>
Which in like manner (that great-grandsire said),<BR>
As well to him his father whilome read;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And his from sire or grandsire heard recite;<BR>
So son from sire; even to that baron, who<BR>
Heard it related by the very wight,<BR>
That these fair pictures without pencil drew,<BR>
Which you see painted azure, red, and white.<BR>
He when to Pharamond (as now to you)<BR>
Was shown the castle on the rocky mount,<BR>
Heard him relate the things I now recount.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Heard him relate, how in that fortilage<BR>
From that good knight should spring, who, &#8217;twould appear,<BR>
Guards it so well, he scorns the fires that rage,<BR>
Even to the Pharo, flaming far and near,<BR>
Then, or within short space, and in that age,<BR>
(And named the week and day, as well as year,)<BR>
A noble warrior, unexcelled in worth<BR>
By other, that has yet appeared on earth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nereus less fair, Achilles was less strong,<BR>
Less was Ulysses famed for daring feat;<BR>
Nestor, that knew so much and lived so long,<BR>
Less prudent; nimble Ladas was less fleet;<BR>
Less liberal and less prompt to pardon wrong,<BR>
Caesar, whose praises ancient tales repeat.<BR>
So that, compared with him, in Ischia born,<BR>
Each might appear of vaunted virtues shorn;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if illustrious Crete rejoiced of old<BR>
In giving birth to Coelus&#8217; godlike heir;<BR>
If Thebes in Hercules and Bacchus bold,<BR>
If Delos boasted of her heavenly pair,<BR>
Nought should as well this happy isle withhold<BR>
From lifting high her glorious head in air,<BR>
When that great Marquis shall in her be born,<BR>
Whom with its every grace shall Heaven adorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sage Merlin said&#8212;and oft renewed that say&#8212;<BR>
He was reserved to flourish in an age,<BR>
When most opprest the Roman empire lay,<BR>
That he might free that holy heritage:<BR>
But as some deeds of his I must display<BR>
Hereafter, these I will not now presage.<BR>
So spake that wizard, and renewed the story,<BR>
Which told of Charlemagne&#8217;s predestined glory.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lewis, (so learned Merlin said,) is woe<BR>
To have brought to Italy King Charlemagne,<BR>
Whom he called in to harass, not o&#8217;erthrow<BR>
That ancient rival of his goodly reign;<BR>
At his return declares himself his foe,<BR>
And, leagued with Venice, would the king detain.<BR>
Behold that valiant monarch couch his spear,<BR>
And in his foes&#8217; despite a passage clear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But his new kingdom leaving to his band,<BR>
Far other destiny awaits that throng:<BR>
For, with the Mantuan&#8217;s friendly succour manned,<BR>
Gonsalvo to the war returns so strong,<BR>
He leaves not in few months, by sea or land,<BR>
One living head, his slaughtered troops among.<BR>
But then, because of one by treason spent,<BR>
In him appears the joy of triumph shent.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
So saying, to his guests the cavalier<BR>
Alphonso, of Pescara hight, displayed:<BR>
&#8220;Who in a thousand feats will shine more clear<BR>
Than the resplendent carbuncle,&#8221; he said.<BR>
&#8220;Behold, deceived by faithless treaty, here,<BR>
Mid snares by the malignant Aethiop laid,<BR>
Transfixt with deadly dart the warrior lies,<BR>
In whom the age&#8217;s worthiest champion dies.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Under Italian escort next they see<BR>
Where the twelfth Lewis o&#8217;er the hills is gone;<BR>
Has by its roots uptorn the mulberry,<BR>
And in Viscontis&#8217; land the lilies sown:<BR>
&#8220;Treading in Charles&#8217;s steps, by him shall be<BR>
Bridges athwart the Garigliano thrown.<BR>
Yet after shall he mourn his army&#8217;s slaughter,<BR>
Dispersed and drowning in that fatal water.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
(The lord pursues) &#8220;with no less overthrow,<BR>
Broken in Puglia, see the Gallic train.<BR>
In him who twice entraps the routed foe,<BR>
Gonslavo you behold, the pride of Spain.<BR>
Fortune to Lewis a fair face shall show,<BR>
As late a troubled mien, upon that plain,<BR>
Which even to where vext Adria pours her tides,<BR>
Po, between Alp and Apennine, divides.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
The host reproved himself, while so he said,<BR>
And pieced his tale, as having left untold<BR>
Things first in order; next to them displayed<BR>
A royal castle by its warder sold.<BR>
A prisoner by the faithless Switzer made,<BR>
He shows the lord who hired him with his gold:<BR>
Which double treason, without couching lance,<BR>
Has given the victory to the king of France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
That warder then shows Caesar Borgia, grown<BR>
Puissant in Italy, through this king&#8217;s grace;<BR>
For all Rome&#8217;s peerage, and all lords that own<BR>
Her sway, he into exile seems to chase:<BR>
Then shows the king, that will the saw take down,<BR>
And papal acorns in Bologna place:<BR>
Then Genoa&#8217;s burghers, by this monarch broke,<BR>
And rebel city stooping to his yoke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You see,&#8221; (pursued that warder,) &#8220;how with dead<BR>
Covered is Ghiaradada&#8217;s green champaign.<BR>
It seems each city opes her gates through dread;<BR>
And Venice scarce her freedom can maintain.<BR>
You see he suffers not the Church&#8217;s head,<BR>
Passing the narrow confines of Romagne,<BR>
Modena from Ferrara&#8217;s duke to reave;<BR>
Who would not to that prince a remnant leave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nay he Bologna rescues from his sway;<BR>
Whither the Bentivogli them betake.<BR>
You next see Lewis siege to Brescia lay,<BR>
And the close-straitened city storm and take;<BR>
Felsina almost at the same time stay<BR>
With succour, and the papal army break;<BR>
And next, &#8217;twould seem, that either hostile band<BR>
Lies tented upon Chassis&#8217; level strand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;On this side France, upon the other Spain,<BR>
Extend their files, and battle rages high;<BR>
Fast fall the men at arms in either train,<BR>
And the green earth is tinged with crimson dye.<BR>
Flooded with human gore seems every drain;<BR>
Mars doubts to whom to give the victory;<BR>
When through Alphonso&#8217;s worth the Spaniards yield,<BR>
And the victorious Franks maintain the field;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, for Ravenna sacked and ravaged lies,<BR>
The Roman pastor bites his lips through woe;<BR>
Called by him, from the hills, in tempest&#8217;s guise,<BR>
Swoop the fierce Germans on the fields below.<BR>
It seems each Frenchman unresisting flies,<BR>
Chased by their bands beyond the mountain snow,<BR>
And that they set the mulberry&#8217;s thriving shoot<BR>
There, whence they plucked the golden lily&#8217;s root.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Behold the Frank returns, and here behold<BR>
Is broken, by the faithless Swiss betrayed,<BR>
He, that his royal father seized and sold,<BR>
Whose succour dearly by the youth is paid.<BR>
Those over whom false Fortune&#8217;s wheel had rolled,<BR>
Erewhile, beneath another king arraid,<BR>
You here behold, preparing to efface<BR>
With vengeful deed Novara&#8217;s late disgrace;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And see with better auspices return<BR>
The valiant Francis, foremost of his train,<BR>
Who so shall break the haughty Switzer&#8217;s horn,<BR>
That little short of spent their bands remain;<BR>
And them shall nevermore the style adorn,<BR>
Usurped by that foul troop of churlish vein,<BR>
Of scourge of princes, and the faith&#8217;s defence,<BR>
To which those rustics rude shall make pretence.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! he takes Milan, in the league&#8217;s despite:<BR>
Lo! with the youthful Sforza makes accord:<BR>
Lo! Bourbon the fair city keeps, in right<BR>
Of Francis, from the furious German horde:<BR>
Lo! while in other high emprize and fight<BR>
Elsewhere is occupied his royal lord,<BR>
Nor knows the pride and license of his host,<BR>
Through these the city shall anew be lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! other French who his grandsire&#8217;s vein<BR>
Inherits, not his generous name alone!<BR>
Who by the Church&#8217;s favour will regain<BR>
&#8212;The Gaul expelled&#8212;a land which was his own.<BR>
France too returns, but keeps a tighter rein,<BR>
Nor over Italy, as wont, has flown:<BR>
For Mantua&#8217;s noble duke the foe shall stay,<BR>
And, at Ticino&#8217;s passage, bar his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though on his cheek youth&#8217;s blossoms scarce appear,<BR>
Worthy immortal glory, Frederick shines;<BR>
And well that praise deserves, since by his spear,<BR>
But more by care and skill, Pavia&#8217;s lines<BR>
Against the French defends that cavalier,<BR>
And frustrates the sea-lion&#8217;s bold designs.<BR>
You see two marquises, Italia&#8217;s boast,<BR>
And both, alike the terror of our host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Both of one blood and of one nest they are;<BR>
The foremost is the bold Alphonso&#8217;s seed,<BR>
Whom, led by that false black into the snare,<BR>
You late beheld in purple torrent bleed.<BR>
You see defeated by his counsel ware,<BR>
How oft the Franks from Italy recede.<BR>
The next, of visage so benign and bright,<BR>
Is lord of Guasto and Alphonso hight;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This is that goodly knight, whose praise you heard<BR>
When rugged Ischia&#8217;s island I displayed,<BR>
Of whom sage Merlin, with prophetic word,<BR>
To Pharamond such mighty matters said;<BR>
Whose birth should to that season be deferred,<BR>
When more than ever such a champion&#8217;s aid,<BR>
Against the barbarous enemy&#8217;s attack,<BR>
Vext Italy, and Church, and Empire lack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He in his cousin of Pescara&#8217;s rear,<BR>
&#8212;Prosper Colonna, chief of that emprize&#8212;<BR>
Makes the rude Switzer pay Bicocca dear,<BR>
Paid by the Frenchman in yet dearer wise.<BR>
Behold where France prepares for fresh career,<BR>
And to repair her many losses tries<BR>
Behold one host on Lombardy descend!<BR>
Behold that other against Naples wend!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Bust she, that moves us like the dust which flies<BR>
Before the restless wind, which whirls it round,<BR>
Lifts if aloft awhile, and from the skies<BR>
Blows back anew the rising cloud to ground,<BR>
To a hundred thousand swells, in Francis&#8217; eyes,<BR>
The soldiers who Pavia&#8217;s walls surround.<BR>
The monarch sees but that which he commands,<BR>
Nor marks how wax or waste his leaguering bands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis thus that, through the greedy servant&#8217;s sin,<BR>
And easy sovereign&#8217;s goodness, on his side,<BR>
The files beneath his banners muster thin,<BR>
When in his midnight camp, &#8216;to arms,&#8217; is cried,<BR>
For by the wary Spaniards charged within<BR>
His ramparts is he; foes that with the guide<BR>
Of Avalo&#8217;s fair lineage, would assay<BR>
To make to heaven or hell their desperate way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You see the best of the nobility<BR>
Of all fair France extinguished on the field;<BR>
How many swords, how many lances, see<BR>
The Spaniards round the valiant monarch wield.<BR>
Behold! his horse falls under him; yet he<BR>
Will neither own himself subdued, or yield;<BR>
Though to assault him from all sides is run<BR>
By wrathful bands, and succour there is none.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The monarch well defends him from the foe,<BR>
All over bathed with blood of hostile vein.<BR>
But valour stoops at last to numbers; lo!<BR>
The king is taken, is conveyed to Spain;<BR>
And all upon Pescara&#8217;s lord bestow<BR>
And him of that inseparable twain&#8212;<BR>
Of Guasto hight&#8212;the praise and prime renown<BR>
For that great king captived and host o&#8217;erthrown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This host o&#8217;erthrown upon Pavia&#8217;s plains,<BR>
That, bound for Naples, halts upon its way:<BR>
As an ill-nourished lamp or taper wanes,<BR>
For want of wax or oil, with flickering ray.<BR>
Lo! the king leaves his sons in Spanish chains,<BR>
And home returns, his own domain to sway.<BR>
Lo! while in Italy he leads his band,<BR>
Another wars upon his native land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In every part you see how Rome is woe,<BR>
Mid ruthless rapine, murder, fire, and rape.<BR>
See all to wasting rack and ruin go,<BR>
And nothing human or divine escape.<BR>
The league&#8217;s men hear the shrieks, behold the glow<BR>
Of hostile fires, and lo! they backward shape<BR>
Their course, where they should hurry on their way,<BR>
And leave the pontiff to his foes a prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lautrec the monarch sends with other bands;<BR>
Yet not anew to war on Lombardy;<BR>
But to deliver from rapacious hands<BR>
The Church&#8217;s head and limbs, already free,<BR>
So slowly he performs the king&#8217;s commands.<BR>
Next, overrun by him the kingdom see,<BR>
And his strong arms against the city turned,<BR>
Wherein the Syren&#8217;s body lies inurned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! the imperial squadrons thither steer,<BR>
Aid to the leaguered city to convey;<BR>
And lo! burnt, sunk, destroyed, they disappear,<BR>
Encountered by the Doria in mid-way.<BR>
Behold! how Fortune light does shift and veer,<BR>
So friendly to the Frenchman till this day!<BR>
Who slays their host with fever, not with lance;<BR>
Nor of a thousand one returns to France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
These histories and more the pictures shew,<BR>
(For to tell all would ask too long a strain)<BR>
In beauteous colours and of different hue;<BR>
Since such that hall, it these could well contain.<BR>
The painting twice and thrice those guests review,<BR>
Nor how to leave them knows the lingering train,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem; perusing oft what they behold<BR>
Inscribed below the beauteous work in gold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
When with these pictures they their sight had fed,<BR>
And talked long while&#8212;these ladies and the rest&#8212;<BR>
They to their chambers by that Lord were led,<BR>
Wont much to worship every worthy guest.<BR>
Already all were sleeping, when her bed<BR>
At last Duke Aymon&#8217;s beauteous daughter prest.<BR>
She here, she there, her restless body throws,<BR>
Now right, now left, but vainly seeks repose:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Yet slumber toward dawn, and in a dream<BR>
The form of her Rogero seems to view.<BR>
The vision cries: &#8220;Why vex yourself, and deem<BR>
Things real which are hollow and untrue?<BR>
Backwards shall sooner flow the mountainstream<BR>
Than I to other turn my thought from you.<BR>
When you I love not, then unloved by me<BR>
This heart, these apples of mine eyes, will be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hither have I repaired (it seemed he said)<BR>
To be baptized and do as I professed.<BR>
If I have lingered, I have been delaid,<BR>
By other wound than that of Love opprest.&#8221;<BR>
With that he vanished from the martial maid,<BR>
And with the vision broken was her rest.<BR>
New floods of tears the awakened damsel shed,<BR>
And to herself in this sad fashion said:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What pleased was but a dream; alas! a sheer<BR>
Reality is this my waking bane;<BR>
My joy a dream and prompt to disappear,<BR>
No dream my cruel and tormenting pain.<BR>
Ah! wherefore what I seemed to see and hear,<BR>
Cannot I, waking, see and hear again?<BR>
What ails ye, wretched eyes, that closed ye show<BR>
Unreal good, and open but on woe?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sweet sleep with promised peace my soul did buoy,<BR>
But I to bitter warfare wake anew;<BR>
Sweet sleep but brought with it fallacious joy,<BR>
But&#8212;sure and bitter&#8212;waking ills ensue.<BR>
If falsehood so delight and truth annoy,<BR>
Never more may I see or hear what&#8217;s true!<BR>
If sleeping brings me weal, and watching woe,<BR>
The pains of waking may I never know!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Blest animals that sleep through half the year,<BR>
Nor ope your heavy eyelids, night nor day!<BR>
For if such tedious sleep like death appear,<BR>
Such watching is like life, I will not say,<BR>
Since&#8212;such my lot, beyond all wont, severe&#8212;<BR>
I death in watching, life in sleep assay.<BR>
But oh! if death such sleep resemble, Death,<BR>
Even now I pray three stop my fleeting breath!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
The clouds were gone, the horizon overspread<BR>
With glowing crimson by the new-born sun,<BR>
And in these signs, unlike the past, was read<BR>
A better promise of the day begun:<BR>
When Bradamant upstarted from her bed,<BR>
And armed her for the journey to be done,<BR>
Her thanks first rendered to the courteous lord,<BR>
For his kind of cheer and hospitable board.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
And found, the lady messenger, with maid<BR>
And squire, had issued from the castled hold,<BR>
And was a-field, where her arrival stayed<BR>
Those three good warriors, those the damsel bold<BR>
The eve before had on the champaign laid,<BR>
Cast from their horses by her lance of gold;<BR>
And who had suffered, to their mighty pain,<BR>
All night, the freezing wind and pattering rain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Add to such ill, that, hungering sore for food,<BR>
They and their horses, through the livelong night,<BR>
Trampling the mire, with chattering teeth, had stood:<BR>
But (what well-nigh engendered more despite<BR>
&#8212;Say not well nigh&#8212;more moved the warrior&#8217;s mood)<BR>
Was that they knew the damsel would recite<BR>
How they had been unhorsed by hostile lance<BR>
In the first course which they had run in France;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
And&#8212;each resolved to die or else his name<BR>
Forthwith in new encounter to retrieve&#8212;<BR>
That Ulany, the message-bearing dame,<BR>
(Whose style no longer I unmentioned leave),<BR>
A fairer notion of their knightly fame<BR>
Than heretofore, might haply now conceive,<BR>
Bold Bradamant anew to fight defied,<BR>
When of the drawbridge clear they her descried;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Not thinking, howsoe&#8217;er, she was a maid,<BR>
Who in no look or act the maid confest;<BR>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter, loth to be delaid,<BR>
Refuses, as a traveller that is pressed.<BR>
But they so often and so sorely prayed,<BR>
That she could ill refuse the kings&#8217; request.<BR>
Her lance she levels, at three strokes extends<BR>
All three on earth, and thus the warfare ends:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
For Bradamant no more her courser wheeled,<BR>
But turned her back upon the foes o&#8217;erthrown.<BR>
They, that intent to gain the golden shield,<BR>
Had sought a land so distant from their own,<BR>
Rising in sullen silence from the field<BR>
(For speech with all their hardihood was gone)<BR>
Appeared as stupefied by their surprise,<BR>
Nor to Ulania dared to lift their eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
For they, as thither they their course addrest,<BR>
Had vaunted to the maid in boasting vein,<BR>
No paladin or knight with lance in rest,<BR>
Against the worst his saddle could maintain.<BR>
To make them vail yet more their haughty crest,<BR>
And look upon the world with less disdain,<BR>
She tells them, by no paladin or peer<BR>
Were they unhorsed, but by a woman&#8217;s spear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Now what of Roland&#8217;s and Rinaldo&#8217;s might,<BR>
Not without reason held in such renown,<BR>
Ought you to think (she said) when thus in fight<BR>
Ye by a female hand are overthrown?<BR>
Say, if the buckler one of these requite,<BR>
&#8212;Better than by a woman ye have done,<BR>
Will ye by those redoubted warriors do?<BR>
So think not I, nor haply think so you.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This may suffice you all; and need in none<BR>
A clearer proof of prowess to display;<BR>
And who desires, if rashly any one<BR>
Desires, again his valour to assay,<BR>
Would add but scathe to shame, now made his own;<BR>
Now; and the same to-day as yesterday.<BR>
Unless perchance he thinks it praise and gain,<BR>
By such illustrious warriors to be slain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
When they by Ulany were certified<BR>
A woman&#8217;s hand had caused their overthrow,<BR>
Who with a deeper black than pitch had dyed<BR>
Their honour, heretofore so fair of show;<BR>
And more than ten her story testified,<BR>
Where one sufficed&#8212;with such o&#8217;erwhelming woe<BR>
Were they possest, they with such fury burned,<BR>
They well nigh on themselves their weapons turned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
What arms they had upon them, they unbound,<BR>
And cast them, strung by rage and fury sore,<BR>
Into the moat which girt that castle round,<BR>
Nor even kept the faulchions which they wore;<BR>
And, since a woman them had cast to ground,<BR>
O&#8217;erwhelmed with rage and shame, the warriors swore,<BR>
Themselves of such a crying shame to clear,<BR>
They, without bearing arms, would pass a year;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
And that they evermore afoot would fare<BR>
Up hill or down, by mountain or by plain,<BR>
Nor, when the year was ended, would they wear<BR>
The knightly mail or climb the steed again;<BR>
Save that from other they by force should bear,<BR>
In battle, other steeds and other chain.<BR>
So, without arms, to punish their misdeeds,<BR>
These wend a-foot, those others on their steeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Lodged in a township at the fall of night,<BR>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter, journeying Paris-ward,<BR>
Hears how King Agramant was foiled in fight.<BR>
Good harbourage withal of bed and board,<BR>
She in her hostel found; but small delight<BR>
This and all comforts else to her afford.<BR>
For the sad damsel meat and sleep foregoes,<BR>
Nor finds a resting place; far less repose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
But so I will not on her story dwell,<BR>
As not to seek anew the valiant twain;<BR>
Who, by consent, beside a lonely well,<BR>
Had tied their goodly coursers by the rein.<BR>
I of their war to you somedeal will tell,<BR>
A war not waged for empire or domain,<BR>
But that the best should buckle to his side<BR>
Good Durindana, and Bayardo ride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
No signal they, no trumpet they attend,<BR>
To blow them to the lists, no master who<BR>
Should teach them when to foin and when to fend,<BR>
Or wake their sleeping wrath; their swords they drew:<BR>
Then, one against the other, boldly wend,<BR>
With lifted blades, the quick and dextrous two.<BR>
Already &#8217;gan the champions&#8217; fury heat,<BR>
And fast and hard their swords were heard to beat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
None e&#8217;er by proof two other faulchions chose<BR>
For sound and solid, able to endure<BR>
Three strokes alone of such conflicting foes,<BR>
Passing all means and measure; but so pure,<BR>
So perfect was their temper, from all blows<BR>
By such repeated trial so secure,<BR>
They in a thousand strokes might clash on high,<BR>
&#8212;Nay more, nor yet the solid metal fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
With mickle industry, with mighty pain<BR>
And art, Rinaldo, shifting here and there,<BR>
Avoids the deadly dint of Durindane,<BR>
Well knowing how &#8217;tis wont to cleave and tear.<BR>
Gradasso struck with greater might and main,<BR>
But well nigh all his strokes were spent in air;<BR>
Of, if he sometimes smote, he smote on part,<BR>
Where Durindana wrought less harm than smart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo with more skill his blade inclined,<BR>
And stunned the arm of Sericana&#8217;s lord.<BR>
Him oft he reached where casque and coat confined,<BR>
And often raked his haunches with the sword:<BR>
But adamantine was his corslet&#8217;s rind,<BR>
Nor link the restless faulchion broke or bored.<BR>
If so impassive was the paynim&#8217;s scale,<BR>
Know, charmed by magic was the stubborn mail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Without reposing they long time had been,<BR>
Upon their deadly battle so intent,<BR>
That, save on one another&#8217;s troubled mien,<BR>
Their angry eyes the warriors had not bent.<BR>
When such despiteous war and deadly spleen,<BR>
Diverted by another strife, were spent,<BR>
Hearing a mighty noise, both champions turn,<BR>
And good Bayardo, sore bested, discern.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
They good Bayardo by a monster view,<BR>
&#8212;A bird, and bigger than that courser&#8212;prest.<BR>
Above three yards in length appeared to view<BR>
The monster&#8217;s beak; a bat in all the rest.<BR>
Equipt with feathers, black as ink in hue,<BR>
And piercing talons was the winged pest;<BR>
An eye of fire it had, a cruel look,<BR>
And, like ship-sails, two spreading pinions shook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Perhaps it was a bird; but when or where<BR>
Another bird resembling this was seen<BR>
I know not, I, nor have I any where,<BR>
Except in Turpin, heard that such has been.<BR>
Hence that it was a fiend, to upper air<BR>
Evoked from depths of nether hell I ween;<BR>
Which Malagigi raised by magic sleight,<BR>
That so he might disturb the champions&#8217; fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
So deemed Rinaldo too: and contest sore<BR>
&#8217;Twixt him and Malagigi hence begun;<BR>
But he would not confess the charge; nay swore,<BR>
Even by the light which lights the glorious sun,<BR>
That he might clear him of the blame he bore,<BR>
He had not that which was imputed done.<BR>
Whether a fiend or fowl, the pest descends,<BR>
And good Bayardo with his talons rends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Quickly the steed, possessed of mickle might,<BR>
Breaks loose, and, in his fury and despair,<BR>
Against the monster strives with kick and bite;<BR>
But swiftly he retires and soars in air:<BR>
He thence returning, prompt to wheel and smite,<BR>
Circles and beats the courser, here and there.<BR>
Wholly unskilled in fence, and sore bested,<BR>
Bayardo swiftly from the monster fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Bayardo to the neighbouring forest flies,<BR>
Seeking the closest shade and thickest spray;<BR>
Above the feathered monster flaps, with eyes<BR>
Intent to mark where widest is the way.<BR>
But that good horse the greenwood threads, and lies<BR>
At last within a grot, concealed from day.<BR>
When the winged beast has lost Bayardo&#8217;s traces.<BR>
He soars aloft, and other quarry chases.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo and Gradasso, who descried<BR>
Bayardo&#8217;s flight, the conqueror&#8217;s destined meed,<BR>
The battle to suspend, on either side,<BR>
Till they regained the goodly horse, agreed,<BR>
Saved from that fowl which chased him, far and wide;<BR>
Conditioning whichever found the steed,<BR>
With him anew should to that fountain wend,<BR>
Beside whose brim their battle they should end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Quitting the fount, they follow, where they view<BR>
New prints upon the forest greensward made:<BR>
By much Bayardo distances the two,<BR>
Whose tardy feet their wishes ill obeyed.<BR>
Himself the king on his Alfana threw,<BR>
That near at hand was tethered in the glade,<BR>
Leaving his foe behind in evil plight;<BR>
&#8212;Never more malcontent and vext in sprite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo ceased in little time to spy<BR>
Bayardo&#8217;s traces, who strange course had run;<BR>
And made for thorny thicket, wet or dry,<BR>
Tree, rock, or river, with design to shun<BR>
Those cruel claws, which, pouncing from the sky,<BR>
To him such outrage and such scathe had done.<BR>
Rinaldo, after labour vain and sore<BR>
To await him at the fount returned once more;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
In case, as erst concerted by the twain,<BR>
The king should thither with the steed resort;<BR>
But having sought him there with little gain,<BR>
Fared to his camp afoot, with piteous port.<BR>
Return we now to him of Sericane,<BR>
He that had sped withal in other sort,<BR>
Who, not by judgement, guided to his prey,<BR>
But his rare fortune, heard Bayardo neigh;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
And found him shrowded in his caverned lair,<BR>
So sore moreover by his fright opprest,<BR>
He feared to issue into open air.<BR>
Thus of that horse himself the king possest.<BR>
Well he remembered their conditions were<BR>
To bring him to the fount; but little pressed<BR>
Now was that knight to keep the promise made,<BR>
And thus within himself in secret said:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Win him who will, in war and strife, I more<BR>
Desire in peace to make the steed my own:<BR>
From the world&#8217;s further side, did I of yore<BR>
Wend hitherward, and for this end alone.<BR>
Having the courser, he mistakes me sore,<BR>
That thinks the prize by me will be foregone.<BR>
Him would Rinaldo conquer, let him fare<BR>
To Ind, as I to France have made repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For him no less secure is Sericane,<BR>
Than twice for me has been his France,&#8221; he said,<BR>
And pricked for Arles, along the road most plain,<BR>
And in its haven found the fleet arrayed.<BR>
Freighted with him, the steed and Durindane,<BR>
A well-rigged galley from that harbour weighed.<BR>
Of these hereafter!&#8212;I, at other call,<BR>
Now quit Rinaldo, king, and France, and all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Astolpho in his flight will I pursue,<BR>
That made his hippogryph like palfrey flee,<BR>
With reins and sell, so quick the welkin through;<BR>
That hawk and eagle soar a course less free.<BR>
O&#8217;er the wide land of Gaul the warrior flew<BR>
From Pyrenees to Rhine, from sea to sea.<BR>
He westward to the mountains turned aside,<BR>
Which France&#8217;s fertile land from Spain divide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
To Arragon he past out of Navarre,<BR>
&#8212;They who beheld, sore wondering at the sight&#8212;<BR>
Then, leaves he Tarragon behind him far,<BR>
Upon his left, Biscay upon his right:<BR>
Traversed Castile, Gallicia, Lisbon, are<BR>
Seville and Cordova, with rapid flight;<BR>
Nor city on sea-shore, nor inland plain,<BR>
Is unexplored throughout the realm of Spain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Beneath him Cadiz and the strait he spied,<BR>
Where whilom good Alcides closed the way;<BR>
From the Atlantic to the further side<BR>
Of Egypt, bent o&#8217;er Africa, to stray;<BR>
The famous Balearic isles descried,<BR>
And Ivica, that in his passage lay;<BR>
Toward Arzilla then he turned the rein,<BR>
Above the sea that severs it from Spain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Morocco, Fez, and Oran, looking down,<BR>
Hippona, Argier, he, and Bugia told,<BR>
Which from all cities bear away the crown,<BR>
No palm or parsley wreath, but crown of gold;<BR>
Noble Biserta next and Tunis-town,<BR>
Capys, Alzerba&#8217;s isle, the warrior bold,<BR>
Tripoli, Berniche, Ptolomitta viewed,<BR>
And into Asia&#8217;s land the Nile pursued.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twixt Atlas&#8217; shaggy ridges and the shore,<BR>
He viewed each regions in his spacious round;<BR>
He turned his back upon Carena hoar,<BR>
And skimmed above the Cyrenaean ground;<BR>
Passing the sandy desert of the Moor,<BR>
In Albajada, reached the Nubian&#8217;s bound;<BR>
Left Battus&#8217; tomb behind him on the plain,<BR>
And Ammon&#8217;s, now dilapidated, fane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
To other Tremizen he posts, where bred<BR>
As well the people are in Mahound&#8217;s style;<BR>
For other Aethiops then his pinions spread,<BR>
Which face the first, and lie beyond the Nile.<BR>
Between Coallee and Dobada sped,<BR>
Bound for the Nubian city&#8217;s royal pile;<BR>
Threading the two, where, ranged on either land,<BR>
Moslems and Christians watch, with arms in hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
In Aethiopia&#8217;s realm Senapus reigns,<BR>
Whose sceptre is the cross; of cities brave,<BR>
Of men, of gold possest, and broad domains,<BR>
Which the Red Sea&#8217;s extremest waters lave.<BR>
A faith well nigh like ours that king maintains,<BR>
Which man from his primaeval doom may save.<BR>
Here, save I err in what their rites require,<BR>
The swarthy people are baptized with fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
Astolpho lighted in the spacious court,<BR>
Intending on the Nubian king to wait.<BR>
Less strong than sumptuous is the wealthy fort,<BR>
Wherein the royal Aethiop keeps his state,<BR>
The chains that serve the drawbridge to support,<BR>
The bolts, the bars, the hinges of the gate,<BR>
And finally whatever we behold<BR>
Herewrought in iron, there is wrought in gold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
High prized withal, albeit it so abound,<BR>
Is that best metal; lodges built in air<BR>
Which on all sides the wealthy pile surround,<BR>
Clear colonnades with crystal shafts upbear.<BR>
Of green, white, crimson, blue and yellow ground,<BR>
A frieze extends below those galleries fair.<BR>
Here at due intervals rich gems combine,<BR>
And topaz, sapphire, emerald, ruby shine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
In wall and roof and pavement scattered are<BR>
Full many a pearl, full many a costly stone.<BR>
Here thrives the balm; the plants were ever rare,<BR>
Compared with these, which were in Jewry grown,<BR>
The musk which we possess from thence we bear,<BR>
In fine those products from this clime are brought,<BR>
Which in our regions are so prized and sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
The soldan, king of the Egyptian land,<BR>
Pays tribute to this sovereign, as his head,<BR>
They say, since having Nile at his command<BR>
He may divert the stream to other bed.<BR>
Hence, with its district upon either hand,<BR>
Forthwith might Cairo lack its daily bread.<BR>
Senapus him his Nubian tribes proclaim;<BR>
We Priest and Prester John the sovereign name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Of all those Aethiop monarchs, beyond measure,<BR>
The first was this, for riches and for might;<BR>
But he with all his puissance, all his treasure,<BR>
Alas! had miserably lost his sight.<BR>
And yet was this the monarch&#8217;s least displeasure;<BR>
Vexed by a direr and a worse despite;<BR>
Harassed, though richest of those Nubian kings,<BR>
By a perpetual hunger&#8217;s cruel stings.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
Whene&#8217;er to eat or drink the wretched man<BR>
Prepared, by that resistless need pursued,<BR>
Forthwith&#8212;infernal and avenging clan&#8212;<BR>
Appeared the monstrous Harpies&#8217; craving brood;<BR>
Which, armed with beak and talons, overran<BR>
Vessel and board, and preyed upon the food;<BR>
And what their wombs suffice not to receive<BR>
Foul and defiled the loathsome monsters leave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
And this, because upborn by such a tide<BR>
Of full blown honours, in his unripe age,<BR>
For he excelled in heart and nerve, beside<BR>
The riches of his royal heritage,<BR>
Like Lucifer, the monarch waxed in pride,<BR>
And war upon his maker thought to wage.<BR>
He with his host against the mountain went,<BR>
Where Egypt&#8217;s mighty river finds a vent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
Upon this hill which well-nigh kissed the skies,<BR>
Piercing the clouds, the king had heard recite,<BR>
Was seated the terrestrial paradise,<BR>
Where our first parents flourished in delight.<BR>
With camels, elephants, and footmen hies<BR>
Thither that king, confiding in his might;<BR>
With huge desire if peopled be the land<BR>
To bring its nations under his command.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
God marred the rash emprise, and from on high<BR>
Sent down an angel, whose destroying sword<BR>
A hundred thousand of that chivalry<BR>
Slew, and to endless night condemned their lord.<BR>
Emerging, next, from hellish caverns, fly<BR>
These horrid harpies and assault his board;<BR>
Which still pollute or waste the royal meat,<BR>
Nor leave the monarch aught to drink or eat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
And him had plunged in uttermost despair<BR>
One that to him erewhile had prophesied<BR>
The loathsome Harpies should his daily fare<BR>
Leave unpolluted only, when astride<BR>
Of winged horse, arriving through the air,<BR>
An armed cavalier should be descried.<BR>
And, for impossible appears the thing,<BR>
Devoid of hope remains the mournful king.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Now that with wonderment his followers spy<BR>
The English cavalier so make his way,<BR>
O&#8217;er every wall, o&#8217;er every turret high,<BR>
Some swiftly to the king the news convey.<BR>
Who calls to mind that ancient prophecy,<BR>
And heedless of the staff, his wonted stay,<BR>
Through joy, with outstretched arms and tottering feet,<BR>
Comes forth, the flying cavalier to meet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
Within the castle court Astolpho flew,<BR>
And there, with spacious wheels, on earth descended;<BR>
The king, conducted by his courtly crew,<BR>
Before the warrior knelt, with arms extended,<BR>
And cried: &#8220;Thou angel send of God, thou new<BR>
Messiah, if too sore I have offended,<BR>
For mercy, yet, bethink thee, &#8217;tis our bent<BR>
To sin, and thine to pardon who repent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Knowing my sin, I ask not, I, to be<BR>
&#8212;Such grace I dare not ask&#8212;restored to light;<BR>
For well I ween such power resides in thee,<BR>
As Being accepted in thy Maker&#8217;s sight.<BR>
Let it suffice, that I no longer see,<BR>
Nor let me with perpetual hunger fight.<BR>
At least, expel the harpies&#8217; loathsome horde,<BR>
Nor let them more pollute my ravaged board;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And I to build thee, in my royal hold,<BR>
A holy temple, made of marble, swear,<BR>
With all its portals and its roof of gold,<BR>
And decked, within and out, with jewels rare.<BR>
Here shall thy mighty miracle be told<BR>
In sculpture, and thy name the dome shall bear.&#8221;<BR>
So spake the sightless king of Nubia&#8217;s reign,<BR>
And sought to kiss the stranger&#8217;s feet in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor angel&#8221;&#8212;good Astolpho made reply&#8212;<BR>
&#8220;Nor new Messiah, I from heaven descend;<BR>
No less a mortal and a sinner I,<BR>
To such high grace unworthy to pretend.<BR>
To slay the monsters I all means will try,<BR>
Or drive them from the realm which they offend.<BR>
If I shall prosper, be thy praises paid<BR>
To God alone, who sent me to thine aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Offer these vows to God, to him well due;<BR>
To him thy churches build, thine altars rear.&#8221;<BR>
Discoursing so, together wend the two,<BR>
&#8217;Mid barons bold, that king and cavalier.<BR>
The Nubian prince commands the menial crew<BR>
Forthwith to bring the hospitable cheer;<BR>
And hopes that now the foul, rapacious band,<BR>
Will not dare snatch the victual from his hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
Forthwith a solemn banquet they prepare<BR>
Within the gorgeous palace of the king.<BR>
Seated alone here guest and sovereign are,<BR>
And the attendant troop the viands bring.<BR>
Behold! a whizzing sound is heard in air,<BR>
Which echoes with the beat of savage wing.<BR>
Behold! the band of harpies thither flies,<BR>
Lured by the scent of victual from the skies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
All bear a female face of pallid dye,<BR>
And seven in number are the horrid band;<BR>
Emaciated with hunger, lean, and dry;<BR>
Fouler than death; the pinions they expand<BR>
Ragged, and huge, and shapeless to the eye;<BR>
The talon crook&#8217;d; rapacious is the hand;<BR>
Fetid and large the paunch; in many a fold,<BR>
Like snake&#8217;s, their long and knotted tails are rolled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
The fowls are heard in air; then swoops amain<BR>
The covey well nigh in that instant, rends<BR>
The food, o&#8217;erturns the vessels, and a rain<BR>
Of noisome ordure on the board descends.<BR>
To stop their nostrils king and duke are fain;<BR>
Such an insufferable stench offends.<BR>
Against the greedy birds, as wrath excites,<BR>
Astolpho with his brandished faulchion smites.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
At croup or collar now he aims his blow,<BR>
Now strikes at neck or pinion; but on all,<BR>
As if he smote upon a bag of tow,<BR>
The strokes without effect and languid fall.<BR>
This while nor dish nor goblet they forego;<BR>
Nor void those ravening fowls the regal hall,<BR>
Till they have feasted full, and left the food<BR>
Waste or polluted by their rapine rude.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
That king had firmly hoped the cavalier<BR>
Would from his royal seat the harpies scare.<BR>
He now, that hope foregone, with nought to cheer,<BR>
Laments, and sighs, and groans in his despair.<BR>
Of his good horn remembers him the peer,<BR>
Whose clangours helpful aye in peril are,<BR>
And deems his bugle were the fittest mean<BR>
To free the monarch from those birds unclean;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
And first to fill their ears, to king and train,<BR>
With melted wax, Astolpho gives command;<BR>
That every one who hears the deafening strain<BR>
May not in panic terror fly the land.<BR>
He takes the reins, his courser backs again,<BR>
Grasps the enchanted bugle in his hand;<BR>
And to the sewer next signs to have the board<BR>
Anew with hospitable victual stored.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
The meats he to an open galley bears,<BR>
And other banquet spreads on other ground.<BR>
Behold, as wont, the harpy-squad appears;<BR>
Astolpho quickly lifts the bugle&#8217;s round;<BR>
And (for unguarded are their harassed ears)<BR>
The harpies are not proof against the sound;<BR>
In terror form the royal dome they speed,<BR>
Nor meat nor aught beside the monsters heed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
After them spurs in haste the valiant peer:<BR>
And on the winged courser forth is flown,<BR>
Leaving beneath him, in his swift career,<BR>
The royal castle and the crowded town;<BR>
The bugle ever pealing, far and near.<BR>
The harpies fly toward the torrid zone;<BR>
Nor light until they reach that loftiest mountain<BR>
Where springs, if anywhere, Nile&#8217;s secret fountain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
Almost at that a&euml;rial mountain&#8217;s feet,<BR>
Deep under earth, extends a gloomy cell.<BR>
The surest pass for him, as they repeat,<BR>
That would at any time descend to hell.<BR>
Hither the predatory troop retreat,<BR>
As a safe refuge from the deafening yell.<BR>
As far, and farther than Cocytus&#8217; shore<BR>
Descending, till that horn is heard no more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
At that dark hellish inlet, which a way<BR>
Opens to him who would abandon light,<BR>
The terrifying bugle ceased to bray;<BR>
&#8212;The courser furled his wings and stopt his flight.<BR>
But, ere Astolpho further I convey,<BR>
&#8212;Not to depart from my accustomed rite&#8212;<BR>
Since on all sides the paper overflows,<BR>
I shall conclude my canto and repose.</TD></TR>
