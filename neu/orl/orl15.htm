<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Round about Paris every where are spread<BR>
The assailing hosts of Africa and Spain.<BR>
Astolpho home by Logistilla sped,<BR>
Binds first Caligorantes with his chain;<BR>
Next from Orrilo&#8217;s trunk divides the head;<BR>
With whom Sir Aquilant had warred in vain,<BR>
And Gryphon bold: next Sansonet discerns,<BR>
Ill tidings of his lady Gryphon learns.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Though Conquest fruit of skill or fortune be,<BR>
To conquer always is a glorious thing.<BR>
&#8217;Tis true, indeed, a bloody victory<BR>
Is to a chief less honour wont to bring;<BR>
And that fair field is famed eternally,<BR>
And he who wins it merits worshipping,<BR>
Who, saving from all harm his own, without<BR>
Loss to his followers, puts the foe to rout.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
You, sir, earned worthy praise, when you o&#8217;erbore<BR>
The lion of such might by sea, and so<BR>
Did by him, where he guarded either shore<BR>
From Francolino to the mouth of Po,<BR>
That I, though yet again I heard him roar,<BR>
If you were present, should my fear forego.<BR>
How fields are fitly won was then made plain;<BR>
For we were rescued, and your foemen slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
This was the Paynim little skilled to do,<BR>
Who was but daring to his proper loss;<BR>
And to the moat impelled his meiny, who<BR>
One and all perished in the burning fosse.<BR>
The mighty gulf had not contained the crew,<BR>
But that, devouring those who sought to cross,<BR>
Them into dust the flame reduced, that room<BR>
Might be for all within the crowded tomb.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Of twenty thousand warriors thither sent,<BR>
Died nineteen thousand in the fiery pit;<BR>
Who to the fosse descended, ill content;<BR>
But so their leader willed, of little wit:<BR>
Extinguished amid such a blaze, and spent<BR>
By the devouring flame the Christians lit.<BR>
And Rodomont, occasion of their woes,<BR>
Exempted from the mighty mischief goes:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
For he to the inner bank, by foes possest,<BR>
Across the ditch had vaulted wonderously:<BR>
Had he within it been, among the rest,<BR>
It sure had been his last assault. His eye<BR>
He turns, and when the wild-fires, which infest<BR>
The infernal vale, he sees ascend so high,<BR>
And hears his people&#8217;s moan and dying screams,<BR>
With imprecations dread he Heaven blasphemes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
This while a band King Agramant had brought,<BR>
To make a fierce assault upon a gate:<BR>
For while the cruel battle here was fought,<BR>
Wherein so many sufferers met their fate,<BR>
This haply unprovided had he thought<BR>
With fitting guard. Upon the monarch wait<BR>
King Bambirago, &#8217;mid his knights of price,<BR>
And Baliverso, sink of every vice.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
And Corineus of Mulga, Prusion,<BR>
The wealthy monarch of the blessed isles;<BR>
Malabuferzo, he who fills the throne<BR>
Of Fez, where a perpetual summer smiles;<BR>
And other noble lords, and many a one<BR>
Well-armed and tried; and others &#8217;mid their files,<BR>
Naked, and base, whose hearts in martial fields<BR>
Had found no shelter from a thousand shields.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
But all things counter to the hopes ensue<BR>
Of Agramant upon his side; within,<BR>
In person, girded by a gallant crew,<BR>
Is Charlemagne, with many a paladin:<BR>
Ogier the Duke, King Salamon, the two<BR>
Guidos are seen, and either Angelin;<BR>
Bavaria&#8217;s duke, and Ganelon are here,<BR>
Avino, Avolio, Otho, and Berlinghier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
And of inferior count withal, a horde<BR>
Of Lombards, French, and Germans, without end;<BR>
Who, every one, in presence of his lord,<BR>
To rank among the valiantest contend,<BR>
This will I in another place record;<BR>
Who here a mighty duke perforce attend,<BR>
Who signs to me from far, and prays that I<BR>
Will not omit him in my history.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis time that I should measure back my way<BR>
Thither, where I Astolpho left of yore;<BR>
Who, in long exile, loathing more to stay,<BR>
Burnt with desire to tread his native shore;<BR>
As hopes to him had given the sober fay,<BR>
Who quelled Alcina by her better lore,<BR>
She with all care would send the warrior back<BR>
By the securest and the freest track.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
And thus by her a barque is fitted out;<BR>
&#8212;A better galley never ploughed the sea;<BR>
And Logistilla wills, for aye in doubt<BR>
Of hinderance from Alcina&#8217;s treachery,<BR>
That good Andronica, with squadron stout,<BR>
And chaste Sophrosina, with him shall be,<BR>
Till to the Arabian Sea, beneath their care,<BR>
Or to the Persian Gulf he safe repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
By Scyth and Indian she prefers the peer<BR>
Should coast, and by the Nabataean reign;<BR>
Content he, after such a round, should veer<BR>
For Persian gulf, or Erithraean main,<BR>
Rather than for that Boreal palace steer,<BR>
Where angry winds aye vex the rude domain:<BR>
So ill, at seasons, favoured by the sun,<BR>
That there, for months together, light is none.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Next, when she all in readiness espied,<BR>
Her license to depart the prudent fay<BR>
Accorded to the duke, first fortified<BR>
With counsel as to things too long to say;<BR>
And that he might no more by charms be stayed<BR>
In place from whence he could not wend his way,<BR>
Him with a useful book and fair purveyed,<BR>
And ever for her love to wear it prayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
How man should guard himself from magic cheats<BR>
The book instructed, which the fay bestowed;<BR>
At the end or the beginning, where it treats<BR>
Of such, an index and appendix showed.<BR>
Another gift, which in its goodly feats<BR>
All other gifts excelled, to her he owed;<BR>
This was a horn, which made whatever wight<BR>
Should hear its clang betake himself to flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
I say, the horn is of such horrid sound,<BR>
That, wheresoe&#8217;er &#8217;tis heard, all fly for fear;<BR>
Nor in the world is one of heart so sound<BR>
That would not fly, should he the bugle hear.<BR>
Wind, thunder, and the shock which rives the ground,<BR>
Come not, in aught, the hideous clangour near.<BR>
With thanks did the good Englishman receive<BR>
The gift, and of the fairy took his leave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Quitting the port and smoother waves, they stand<BR>
To sea, with favouring wind which blows astern;<BR>
And (coasting) round the rich and populous land<BR>
Of odoriferous Ind the vessels turn,<BR>
Opening a thousand isles on either hand,<BR>
Scattered about that sea, till they discern<BR>
The land of Thomas; here the pilot veers<BR>
His ready tiller, and more northward steers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Astolpho, furrowing that ocean hoar,<BR>
Marks, as he coasts, the wealthy land at ease.<BR>
Ganges amid the whitening waters roar,<BR>
Nigh skirting now the golden Chersonese;<BR>
Taprobana with Cori next, and sees<BR>
The frith which chafes against its double shore;<BR>
Makes distant Cochin, and with favouring wind<BR>
Issues beyond the boundaries of Ind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Scouring at large broad ocean, with a guide<BR>
So faithful and secure, the cavalier<BR>
Questions Andronica, if from that side<BR>
Named from the westering sun, of this our sphere,<BR>
Bark, which with oars or canvas stemmed the tide,<BR>
On eastern sea was wonted to appear;<BR>
&#8212;And could a wight, who loosed from Indian strand,<BR>
Reach France or Britain, without touching land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Andronica to England&#8217;s duke replies:<BR>
&#8220;Know that this earth is girt about with seas,<BR>
And all to one another yield supplies,<BR>
Whether the circling waters boil or freeze:<BR>
But, since the Aethiops&#8217; land before us lies,<BR>
Extending southward many long degrees.<BR>
Across his waters, some one has supposed<BR>
A barrier here to Neptune interposed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hence bark from this Levant of Ind is none<BR>
Which weighs, to shape her course for Europe&#8217;s shore;<BR>
Nor navigates from Europe any one,<BR>
Our Oriental regions to explore;<BR>
Fain to retrace alike the course begun<BR>
By the mid land, extending wide before:<BR>
Weening (its limits of such length appear)<BR>
That it must join another hemisphere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But in the course of circling years I view<BR>
From farthest lands which catch the western ray,<BR>
New Argonauts put forth, and Tiphys new<BR>
Opening, till now an undiscovered way.<BR>
Others I see coast Afric, and pursue<BR>
So far the negroes&#8217; burning shore, that they<BR>
Pass the far sign, from whence, on his return,<BR>
The sun moves hither, leaving Capricorn;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And find the limit of this length of land,<BR>
Which makes a single sea appear as two;<BR>
Who, scouring in their frigates every strand,<BR>
Pass Ind and Arab isles, or Persian through:<BR>
Others I see who leave, on either hand,<BR>
The banks, which stout Alcides cleft in two,<BR>
And in the manner of the circling sun,<BR>
To seek new lands and new creations run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The imperial flags and holy cross I know,<BR>
Fixed on the verdant shore; see some upon<BR>
The shattered barks keep guard, and others go<BR>
A-field, by whom new countries will be won;<BR>
Ten chase a thousand of the flying foe,<BR>
Realms beyond Ind subdued by Arragon;<BR>
And see all, wheresoe&#8217;er the warriors wend,<BR>
To the fifth Charles&#8217; triumphant captains bend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That this way should be hidden was God&#8217;s will<BR>
Of old, and ere &#8217;twas known long time should run;<BR>
Nor will he suffer its discovery, till<BR>
The sixth and seventh century be done.<BR>
And he delays his purpose to fulfil,<BR>
In that he would subject the world to one,<BR>
The justest and most fraught with prudent lore<BR>
Or emperors, since Augustus, or before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of Arragon and Austria&#8217;s blood I see<BR>
On the left bank of Rhine a monarch bred;<BR>
No sovereign is so famed in history,<BR>
Of all whose goodly deeds are heard or read.<BR>
Astraea reinthroned by him will be,&#8212;<BR>
Rather restored to life, long seeming dead;<BR>
And Virtues with her into exile sent,<BR>
By him shall be recalled from banishment.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For such desert, Heaven&#8217;s bounty not alone<BR>
Designs he should the imperial garland bear,&#8212;<BR>
Augustus&#8217;, Trajan&#8217;s, Mark&#8217;s, Severus&#8217;, crown;<BR>
But that of every farthest land should wear,<BR>
Which here and there extends, as yet unknown,<BR>
Yielding no passage to the sun and year;<BR>
And wills that in his time Christ&#8217;s scattered sheep<BR>
Should be one flock, beneath one Shepherd&#8217;s keep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And that this be accomplished with more ease,<BR>
Writ in the skies from all eternity,<BR>
Captains, invincible by lands and seas,<BR>
Shall heavenly Providence to him supply.<BR>
I mark Hernando Cortez bring, &#8217;mid these,<BR>
New cities under Caesar&#8217;s dynasty,<BR>
And kingdoms in the Orient so remote,<BR>
That we of these in India have no note.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With Prospero Colonna, puissant peer,<BR>
A marquis of Pescara I behold;&#8212;<BR>
A youth of Guasto next, who render dear<BR>
Hesperia to the flower-de-luce of gold;<BR>
I see prepared to enter the career<BR>
This third, who shall the laurel win and hold;<BR>
As a good horse before the rest will dart,<BR>
And first attain the goal, though last to start.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I see such faith, such valour in the deeds<BR>
Of young Alphonso (such his name) confest,<BR>
He in his unripe age,&#8212;nor he exceeds<BR>
His sixth and twentieth year,&#8212;at Caesar&#8217;s hest,<BR>
(A mighty trust) the imperial army leads:<BR>
Saving which, Caesar not alone the rest<BR>
Of his fair empire saves, but may the world<BR>
Reduce, with ensigns by this chief unfurled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As with these captains, where the way by land<BR>
Is free, he spreads the ancient empire&#8217;s sway,<BR>
So on the sea, which severs Europe&#8217;s strand<BR>
From Afric, open to the southern day,<BR>
When with good Doria linked in friendly band,<BR>
Victorious he shall prove in every fray.<BR>
This is that Andrew Doria who will sweep<BR>
From pirates, on all sides, your midland deep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Pompey, though he chased rovers everywhere,<BR>
Was not his peer; for ill the thievish brood<BR>
Vanquished by him, in puissance, could compare<BR>
With the most mighty realm that ever stood.<BR>
But Doria singly will of the corsair<BR>
With his own forces purge the briny flood:<BR>
So that I see each continent and isle<BR>
Quake at his name, from Calpe to the Nile.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Beneath the faith, beneath the warrantry<BR>
Of the redoubted chief, of whom I say,<BR>
I see Charles enter fertile Italy,<BR>
To which this captain clears the monarch&#8217;s way;<BR>
But on his country, not himself, that fee<BR>
Shall he bestow, which is his labour&#8217;s pay;<BR>
And beg her freedom, where himself perchance<BR>
Another would to sovereign rule advance.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The pious love he bears his native land<BR>
Honours him more than any battle&#8217;s gain<BR>
Which Julius ever won on Afric&#8217;s strand,<BR>
Or in thine isle, France, Thessaly, or Spain.<BR>
Nor great Octavius does more praise command,<BR>
Nor Anthony who jousted for the reign,<BR>
With equal arms: in that the wrong outweighs<BR>
&#8212;Done to their native land&#8212;their every praise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Let these, and every other wight who tries<BR>
To subject a free country, blush for shame,<BR>
Nor dare in face of man to lift his eyes,<BR>
Where he hears Andrew Doria&#8217;s honoured name!<BR>
To him I see Charles other meed supplies;<BR>
For he beside his leaders&#8217; common claim,<BR>
Bestows upon the chief the sumptuous state,<BR>
Whence Norman bands their power in Puglia date.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not only to this captain courtesy<BR>
Shall Charles display, still liberal of his store;<BR>
But to all those who for the empery<BR>
In his emprizes have not spared their gore.<BR>
Him to bestow a town,&#8212;a realm&#8212;I see,<BR>
Upon a faithful friend, rejoicing more,<BR>
And on all such as have good service done,<BR>
Than in new kingdom and new empire won.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Thus of the victories, by land and main,<BR>
Which, when long course of years shall be complete,<BR>
Charles&#8217; worthy captains for their lord will gain,<BR>
Andronica did with Astolpho treat.<BR>
This while, now loosening, tightening now, the rein<BR>
On the eastern winds, which blow upon their feet,<BR>
Making this serve or that, her comrade stands;<BR>
While the blasts rise or sink as she commands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
This while they saw, as for their port they made,<BR>
How wide the Persian sea extends to sight;<BR>
Whence in few days the squadron was conveyed<BR>
Nigh the famed gulf from ancient Magi hight;<BR>
Here they found harbourage; and here were stayed<BR>
Their wandering barks, which stern to shore were dight.<BR>
Secure from danger from Alcina&#8217;s wrath,<BR>
The duke by land continued hence his path.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
He pricks through many a field and forest blind,<BR>
By many a vale and many a mountain gray;<BR>
Where robbers, now before and now behind,<BR>
Oft threat the peer by night or open day;<BR>
Lion and dragon oft of poisonous kind,<BR>
And other savage monsters cross his way:<BR>
But he no sooner has his bugle wound,<BR>
Than these are scared and scattered by the sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Through Araby the blest he fares, where grow<BR>
Thickets of myrrh, and gums odorous ooze,<BR>
Where the sole phoenix makes her nest, although<BR>
The world is all before her where to choose;<BR>
And to the avenging sea which whelmed the foe<BR>
Of Israel, his way the duke pursues;<BR>
In which King Pharaoh and his host were lost:<BR>
From whence he to the land of heroes crost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Astolpho along Trajan&#8217;s channel goes,<BR>
Upon that horse which has no earthly peer,<BR>
And moves so lightly, that the soft sand shows<BR>
No token of the passing cavalier;<BR>
Who prints not grass, prints not the driven snows,<BR>
&#8212;Who dry-shod would the briny billows clear,<BR>
And strains so nimbly in the course, he wind<BR>
And thunderbolt and arrow leaves behind:&#8212;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
Erst Argal&igrave;a&#8217;s courser, which was born<BR>
From a close union of the wind and flame,<BR>
And, nourished not by hay or heartening corn,<BR>
Fed on pure air, and Rabican his name.<BR>
His way the bearer of the magic horn<BR>
Following, where Nile received that river, came;<BR>
But ere he at its outlet could arrive,<BR>
Towards him saw a pinnace swiftly drive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
A hermit in the poop the bark did guide<BR>
With snowy beard descending to mid breast;<BR>
Who when from far the Paladin be spied,<BR>
Him to ascend his ready pinnace prest.<BR>
&#8220;My son, unless thou loathest life, (he cried)<BR>
And wouldst that Death to-day thy course arrest,<BR>
Content thee in my bark to cross the water;<BR>
For yonder path conducts thee straight to slaughter.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Within six miles, no further, shalt thou light<BR>
(Pursued the hermit) on the bloody seat,<BR>
Where dwells a giant, horrible to sight,<BR>
Exceeding every stature by eight feet.<BR>
From him wayfaring man or errant knight<BR>
Would vainly hope with life to make retreat;<BR>
For some the felon quarters, some he flays,<BR>
And some he swallows quick, and some he slays.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, &#8217;mid the cruel horrors he intends,<BR>
Takes pleasure in a net, by cunning hands<BR>
Contrived, which near his mansion he extends;<BR>
So well concealed beneath the crumbling sands,<BR>
That whoso uninstructed thither wends,<BR>
Nought of the subtle mischief understands;<BR>
And so the giant scares him with his cries,<BR>
That he within the toils in terror flies;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whom with loud laughter, to his seat hard by<BR>
He drags along, enveloped in his snare;<BR>
And knight and damsel views with equal eye,<BR>
And for his prisoners&#8217; worth has little care.<BR>
Then, having sucked their brains and life-blood dry,<BR>
Casts forth their bones upon the desert lair;<BR>
And round about his griesly palace pins,<BR>
For horrid ornament, their bloody skins.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Take this,&#8212;my son, oh! take this other way,<BR>
Which thee will to the sea in safety guide.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;I thank thee, holy father, for thy say,<BR>
(To him the fearless cavalier replied)<BR>
But cannot peril against honour weigh,<BR>
Far dearer than my life. To the other side<BR>
Me vainly dost thou move to pass the wave;<BR>
Rather for this I seek the giant&#8217;s cave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I with dishonour life to flight may owe;<BR>
But worse than death loath thus to save my head.<BR>
The worst that can befall me if I go,<BR>
Is I my blood shall with the others shed:<BR>
But if on me such mercy God bestow,<BR>
That I remain alive, the giant dead,<BR>
Secure for thousands shall I make the ways;<BR>
So that the greater good the risque o&#8217;erpays.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I peril but the single life of one<BR>
Against safety of the countless rest.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Go then in peace,&#8221; (the other said) &#8220;my son,<BR>
And to thy succour, form among the blest,<BR>
May God dispatch the Archangel Michael down.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;And him, with that, the simple hermit blest.<BR>
Astolpho pricks along Nile&#8217;s rosy strand,<BR>
More in his horn confiding than his brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Between the mighty river and the fen,<BR>
A path upon the sandy shore doth lie,<BR>
Barred by the giant&#8217;s solitary den<BR>
Cut off from converse with humanity.<BR>
About it heads and naked limbs of men<BR>
Were fixed, the victims of his cruelty.<BR>
Window or battlements was not, whence strung<BR>
Might not be seen some wretched prisoner hung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
As in hill-farm or castle, fenced with moat,<BR>
The hunter, mindful what his dangers were,<BR>
Aye fastens on his door the shaggy coat<BR>
And horrid paws and monstrous head of bear;<BR>
So showed the giant those of greatest note,<BR>
Who, thither brought, had perished in his snare.<BR>
The bones of countless others wide were spread,<BR>
And every ditch with human blood was red.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Caligorant was standing at the gate<BR>
(For so was the despiteous monster hight);<BR>
Who decked his house with corpses, as for state<BR>
Some theirs with cloth of gold and scarlet dight.<BR>
He scarce contained himself for joy, so great<BR>
His pleasure, when the duke appeared in sight;<BR>
For &#8217;twas two months complete, a third was near,<BR>
Since by that road had past a cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Towards the marish, where green rushes grow,<BR>
He hastes, intending from that covert blind<BR>
To double on his unsuspecting foe,<BR>
And issue on the cavalier behind:<BR>
For him to drive into the net, below<BR>
The sand, the griesly giant had designed;<BR>
As others trapt he had been wont to see,<BR>
Brought thither by their evil destiny.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
When him the wary paladin espied,<BR>
He stopt his courser, not without great heed,<BR>
Lest he into the covert snare might tide,<BR>
Forewarned of this by the good hermit&#8217;s rede.<BR>
Here to his horn for succour he applied,<BR>
Nor failed its wonted virtue in this need:<BR>
It smote the giant&#8217;s heart with such affright,<BR>
That he turned back, and homeward fled outright.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Astolpho blew, still watchful of surprise,<BR>
Weening to see the engine sprung: fast flew<BR>
The giant,&#8212;as if heart as well as eyes<BR>
The thief had lost,&#8212;nor whitherward he knew:<BR>
Such is his fear, he kens not as he flies,<BR>
How is own covert mischief to eschew:<BR>
He runs into the net, which closing round,<BR>
Hampers the wretch, and drags him to the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Astolpho, who beholds his bulky prey<BR>
Fall bodily, drives thither at full speed,<BR>
Secure himself, and, bent&#8212;to make him pay<BR>
The price of slaughtered thousands&#8212;quits his steed.<BR>
Yet after, deems a helpless wight to slay<BR>
No valour were, but rather foul misdeed:<BR>
For him, arms, neck, and feet, so closely tied,<BR>
He could not shake himself, the warrior spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
With subtle thread of steel had Vulcan wrought<BR>
The net of old, and with such cunning pain,<BR>
He, who to break its weakest mesh had sought,<BR>
Would have bestowed his time and toil in vain.<BR>
It was with this he Mars and Venus caught,<BR>
Who, hands and feet, were fettered by the chain:<BR>
Nor did the jealous husband weave the thread<BR>
For aught, but to surprise that pair in bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Mercury from the smith conveyed the prize,<BR>
Wanting to take young Chloris in the snare;<BR>
Sweet Chloris, who behind Aurora flies,<BR>
At rise of sun, through fields of liquid air,<BR>
And from her gathered garment, through the skies,<BR>
Scatters the violet, rose, and lily fair.<BR>
He for this nymph his toils so deftly set,<BR>
One day, in air he took her with the net.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
The nymph (it seems) was taken as she flew,<BR>
Where the great Aethiop river meets the brine:<BR>
The net was treasured in Canopus, through<BR>
Successive ages, in Anubis&#8217; shrine.<BR>
After three thousand years, Caligorant drew<BR>
The sacred relict from the palace divine:<BR>
Whence with the net the impious thief returned,<BR>
Who robbed the temple and the city burned,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
He fixed it here, beneath the sandy plain,<BR>
In mode, that all the travellers whom he chased<BR>
Ran into it, and the engine was with pain<BR>
Touched, ere it arms, and feet, and neck embraced.<BR>
From this the good Astolpho took a chain,<BR>
And with the gyve his hands behind him laced:<BR>
His arms and breast he swaddled in such guise,<BR>
He could not loose himself; then let him rise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
After, his other knots unfastening,<BR>
(For he was turned more gentle than a maid)<BR>
Astolpho, as a show, the thief would bring,<BR>
By city, borough-town, and farm conveyed;<BR>
The net as well; than which no quainter thing<BR>
Was ever by the file and hammer made.<BR>
On him, like sumpter-nag he laid the load,<BR>
In triumph led, behind him, on his road.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Him helm and shield he gives alike to bear,<BR>
As to a valet; hence proceeds the peer,<BR>
Gladdening the fearful pilgrim every where,<BR>
Who joys to think, henceforth his way is clear.<BR>
So far an end does bold Astolpho fare,<BR>
He is to Memphis&#8217; tombs already near,&#8212;<BR>
Memphis renowned for pyramids; in sight,<BR>
He marks the populous Cairo opposite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Ran all the people in tumultuous tide,<BR>
To see him drag the unmeasured wight along.<BR>
&#8220;How can it be,&#8221; (each to his fellow cried)<BR>
&#8220;That one so weak could master one so strong?&#8221;<BR>
Scarce can Astolpho put the press aside,<BR>
So close from every part their numbers throng;<BR>
While all admire him as a cavalier<BR>
Of mighty worth, and make him goodly cheer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Then Cairo was not such, as common cry<BR>
Pronounces in our age that costly seat;<BR>
&#8212;That eighteen thousand districts ill supply<BR>
Lodging to those who in her markets meet;<BR>
&#8212;And though the houses are three stories high,<BR>
Numbers are forced to sleep in the open street;<BR>
And that the soldan has a palace there<BR>
Of wonderous size, and passing rich and fair;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
And therein (Christian renegadoes all)<BR>
Keeps fifteen thousand vassals, for his needs,<BR>
Beneath one roof supplied with bower and stall,<BR>
Themselves, and wives, and families, and steeds.<BR>
The duke desired to see the river&#8217;s fall,<BR>
And how far Nile into the sea proceeds.<BR>
At Damietta; where wayfaring wight,<BR>
He heard, was prisoner made or slain outright.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
For at Nile&#8217;s outlet there, beside his bed,<BR>
A sturdy thief was sheltered in a tower,<BR>
Alike the native&#8217;s and the stranger&#8217;s dread,<BR>
Wont even to Cairo&#8217;s gate the road to scower.<BR>
Him no one could resist, and, it was said,<BR>
That man to slay the felon had no power.<BR>
A hundred thousand wounds he had in strife<BR>
Received, yet none could ever take his life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
To see if he could break the thread which tied<BR>
The felon&#8217;s life, upon his way the knight<BR>
Set forward, and to Damietta hied,<BR>
To find Orrilo, so the thief was hight;<BR>
Thence to the river&#8217;s outlet past, and spied<BR>
The sturdy castle on the margin dight;<BR>
Harboured in which the enchanted demon lay,<BR>
The fruit of a hobgoblin and a fay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
He here Orrilo and two knights in mail<BR>
Found at fierce strife: the two ill held their own<BR>
Against him; so Orrilo did assail<BR>
The warlike pair, although himself alone;<BR>
And how much either might in arms avail,<BR>
Fame through the universal world had blown.<BR>
Of Oliviero&#8217;s seed was either plant;<BR>
Gryphon the white, and sable Aquilant.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
The necromancer had this while (to say<BR>
The truth) with vantage on his side, begun<BR>
The fight, who brought a monster to the fray,<BR>
Found only in those parts, and wont to won<BR>
Ashore or under water, and to prey,<BR>
For food, on human bodies; feeding on<BR>
Poor mariners and travelling men, who fare,<BR>
Of the impending danger, unaware.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
The monster, slaughtered by the brethren two,<BR>
Upon the sand beside the haven lies;<BR>
And hence no wrong they to Orrilo do,<BR>
Assailing him together in this guise.<BR>
Him they dismembered often and not slew:<BR>
Now he,&#8212;because dismembered,&#8212;ever dies;<BR>
For he replaces leg or hand like wax,<BR>
Which the good faulchion from his body hacks.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Gryphon and Aquilant by turns divide,<BR>
Now to the teeth, now breast, the enchanted wight.<BR>
The fruitless blow Orrilo does deride,<BR>
While the two baffled warriors rage for spite.<BR>
Let him who falling silver has espied<BR>
(Which mercury by alchymists is hight)<BR>
Scatter, and reunite each broken member,<BR>
Hearing my tale, what he has seen remember.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
If the thief&#8217;s head be severed by the pair,<BR>
He lights and staggers till he finds it; now<BR>
Uptaken by the nose or by the hair,<BR>
And fastened to the neck, I know not how.<BR>
This sometimes Gryphon takes, and whirled through air,<BR>
Whelms in the stream; but bootless is the throw:<BR>
For like a fish can fierce Orrilo swim;<BR>
And safely, with the head, regains the brim.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Two ladies, meetly clad in fair array,<BR>
One damsel was in black and one in white,<BR>
And who had been the occasion of that fray,<BR>
Stood by to gaze upon the cruel fight:<BR>
Either of these was a benignant fay,<BR>
Whose care had nourished one and the other knight,<BR>
Oliver&#8217;s children; when the babes forlorn<BR>
They from the claws of two huge birds had torn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Since, from Gismonda they had these conveyed,<BR>
Borne to a distance from their native sky.<BR>
But more to say were needless, since displaid<BR>
To the whole world has been their history.<BR>
Though the author has the father&#8217;s name mis-said;<BR>
One for another (how I know not, I)<BR>
Mistaking. Now this fearful strife the pair<BR>
Of warriors waged at both the ladies&#8217; prayer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Though it was noon in the happy islands, day<BR>
Had vanished in this clime, displaced by night;<BR>
And, underneath the moon&#8217;s uncertain ray,<BR>
And ill-discerned, were all things hid from sight;<BR>
When to the fort Orrilo took his way.<BR>
Since both the sable sister and the white<BR>
Were pleased the furious battle to defer,<BR>
Till a new sun should in the horizon stir.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
The duke, who by their ensigns, and yet more<BR>
Had by the sight of many a vigorous blow,<BR>
Gryphon and Aquilant long time before<BR>
Agnized, to greet the brethren was not slow:<BR>
And they, who in the peer, victorious o&#8217;er<BR>
The giant, whom he led a captive, know<BR>
The BARON OF THE PARD, (so styled at court)<BR>
Him to salute, with no less love resort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
The ladies to repose the warriors led<BR>
To a fair palace near, their sumptuous seat:<BR>
Thence issuing courtly squire and damsel sped,<BR>
Them with lit torches in mid-way to meet.<BR>
Their goodly steeds they quit, there well bested,<BR>
Put off their arms, and in a garden sweet<BR>
Discern the ready supper duly laid<BR>
Fast by, where a refreshing fountain played.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Here they bid bind the giant on the green,<BR>
Fast-tethered by a strong and weighty chain<BR>
To a tough oak, whose ancient trunk they ween<BR>
May well be proof against a single strain;<BR>
With that, by ten good serjeants overseen,<BR>
Lest he by night get loose, and so the train<BR>
Assault and haply harm; while careless they<BR>
Without a guard and unsuspecting lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
At the abundant and most sumptuous board,<BR>
With costly viands (its least pleasure) fraught,<BR>
The longest topic for discourse afford<BR>
Orrilo&#8217;s prowess, and the marvel wrought;<BR>
For head or arm dissevered by the sword,<BR>
They (who upon the recent wonder thought)<BR>
Might think a dream to see him re-unite,<BR>
And but return more furious to the fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Astolpho in his book had found exprest<BR>
(That which prescribed a remedy for spell)<BR>
How he who of one hair deprived the pest<BR>
Only could him in battle hope to quell:<BR>
But this plucked out or sheared, he from his breast<BR>
Parforce the felon&#8217;s spirit would expell.<BR>
So says the volume; but instructs not where,<BR>
&#8217;Mid locks so thickly set, to find the hair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
The duke no less with hope of conquest glows<BR>
Than if the palm he has already won;<BR>
As he that hopes with small expense of blows<BR>
To pluck the hair, the wizard-wight undone.<BR>
Hence does he to the youthful pair propose<BR>
The burden of that enterprize upon<BR>
Himself to take: Orrilo will he slay,<BR>
If the two brethren nought the intent gainsay,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
But willingly to him these yield the emprize,<BR>
Assured his toil will be bestowed in vain;<BR>
And now a new Aurora climbs the skies,<BR>
And from his walls Orrilo on the plain<BR>
Drops,&#8212;and the strife begins&#8212;Orrilo plies<BR>
The mace, the duke the sword; he &#8217;mid a rain<BR>
Of strokes would from the body at one blow<BR>
Divorce the spirit of the enchanted foe:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Together with the mace he lops the fist;<BR>
And now this arm, now the other falls to ground;<BR>
Sometimes he cleaves the corslet&#8217;s iron twist,<BR>
And piecemeal shares and maims the felon round.<BR>
Orrilo re-unites the portions missed,<BR>
Found on the champagne, and again is sound:<BR>
And, though into a hundred fragments hewed,<BR>
Astolpho sees him, in a thought, renewed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
After a thousand blows, Astolpho sped<BR>
One stroke, above the shoulders and below<BR>
The chin, which lopt away both helm and head:<BR>
Nor lights the duke less swiftly than his foe.<BR>
Then grasps the hair defiled with gore and red,<BR>
Springs in a moment on his horse, and lo!<BR>
Up-stream with it along Nile&#8217;s margin hies,<BR>
So that the thief cannot retake the prize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
That fool, who had not marked the warrior&#8217;s feat,<BR>
Was searching in the dust to find his head;<BR>
But when he heard the charger in retreat,<BR>
Who through the forest with the plunder fled,<BR>
Leapt quickly into his own courser&#8217;s seat,<BR>
And in pursuit of bold Astolpho sped.<BR>
Fain had Orrilo shouted &#8220;Hola! stay!&#8221;<BR>
But that the duke had borne his mouth away:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Yet pleased Astolpho had not in like guise<BR>
Borne off his heels, pursues with flowing rein.<BR>
Him Rabican, who marvellously flies,<BR>
Distances by a mighty length of plain.<BR>
This while the wizard&#8217;s head Astolpho eyes<BR>
From poll to front, above the eyebrows twain,<BR>
Searching, in haste, if he the hair can see<BR>
Which makes Orrilo&#8217;s immortality.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Amid innumerable locks, no hair<BR>
Straiter or crisper than the rest was seen.<BR>
How then should good Astolpho, in his care<BR>
To slay the thief, so many choose between?<BR>
&#8220;To cut them all (he said) it better were.&#8221;<BR>
And since he scissors lacked and razor keen,<BR>
He wanting these, resorted to his glaive,<BR>
Which cut so well, it might be said to shave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
And, holding, by the nose, the severed head,<BR>
Close-sheared it all, behind and eke before.<BR>
He found, among the rest, the fatal thread.<BR>
Then pale became the visage, changing sore,<BR>
Turned up its eyes, and signals sore and dread<BR>
Of the last agony of nature wore;<BR>
And the headless body seated in the sell,<BR>
Shuddered its last, and from the courser fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The duke returns where he the champions two<BR>
And dames had left, the trophy in his hand,<BR>
Which manifests of death the tokens true;<BR>
And shows the distant body on the sand.<BR>
I know not if they this with pleasure view,<BR>
Though him they welcome with demeanour bland:<BR>
For the intercepted victory might pain<BR>
Perchance inflict upon the envying twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Nor do I think that either gentle fay<BR>
With pleasure could that battle&#8217;s issue see:<BR>
Since those kind dames, because they would delay<BR>
The doleful fate which shortly was to be<BR>
In France the brethren&#8217;s lot, had in that fray<BR>
With fierce Orrilo matched the warriors free;<BR>
And so to occupy the pair had cast,<BR>
Till the sad influence of the skies were past.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
When to the castellan was certified<BR>
In Damietta, that the thief was dead,<BR>
He loosed a carrier pigeon, having tied<BR>
Beneath her wing a letter by a thread.<BR>
She went to Cairo; and, to scatter wide<BR>
The news, another from that town was sped<BR>
(Such is the usage there); so, Egypt through,<BR>
In a few hours the joyful tidings flew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
As he had brought the adventure to an end,<BR>
The duke now sought the noble youths to stir,<BR>
(Though of themselves that way their wishes tend,<BR>
Nor they to whet that purpose need the spur)<BR>
That they the Church from outrage to defend,<BR>
And rights of Charles, the Roman Emperor,<BR>
Would cease to war upon that Eastern strand,<BR>
And would seek honour in their native land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Gryphon and Aquilant thus bid adieu,<BR>
One and the other, to his lady fair;<BR>
Who, though it sorely troubled them, ill knew<BR>
How to resist the wishes of the pair.<BR>
The duke, together with the warlike two,<BR>
Turns to the right, resolved to worship, where<BR>
God erst incarnate dwelt, the holy places,<BR>
Ere he to cherished France his way retraces.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
The warriors to the left-hand might incline,<BR>
As plainer and more full of pleasant cheer,<BR>
Where still along the sea extends their line;<BR>
But take the right-hand path, abrupt and drear;<BR>
Since the chief city of all Palestine,<BR>
By six days&#8217; journey, is, through this, more near.<BR>
Water there is along this rugged track,<BR>
And grass; all other needful matters lack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
So that, before they enter on their road,<BR>
All that is needful they collect, and lay<BR>
Upon the giant&#8217;s back the bulky load,<BR>
Who could a tower upon his neck convey.<BR>
The Holy Land a mountain-summit showed,<BR>
At finishing their rough and salvage way;<BR>
Where HEAVENLY LOVE a willing offering stood,<BR>
And washed away our errors with his blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
They, at the entrance of the city, view<BR>
A gentle stripling; and in him the three<BR>
Agnize Sir Sansonet of Mecca, who<BR>
Was, in youth&#8217;s flower, for sovereign chivalry,<BR>
For sovereign goodness, famed the country through,<BR>
And wise beyond his years: from paganry<BR>
Converted by Orlando to the truth,<BR>
Who had, with his own hands, baptized the youth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Designing there a fortilage, in front<BR>
Of Egypt&#8217;s caliph they the warrior found;<BR>
And with a wall two miles in length, the mount<BR>
Of Calvary intending to surround.<BR>
Received with such a countenance, as is wont<BR>
To be of inward love the surest ground,<BR>
Them he conducted to his royal home,<BR>
And, with all comfort, harboured in the dome.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
As deputy, the sainted land he swayed,<BR>
Conferred on him by Charlemagne, in trust,<BR>
To him the English duke a present made<BR>
Of that so sturdy and unmeasured beast,<BR>
That it ten draught horse burdens had conveyed;<BR>
So monstrous was the giant, and next gave<BR>
The net, in which he took the unwieldy slave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
In quittance, Sansonet, his sword to bear,<BR>
Gave a rich girdle to Astolpho bold,<BR>
And spurs for either heel, a costly pair,<BR>
With bucklers and with rowels made of gold;<BR>
Which (&#8217;twas believed) the warrior&#8217;s relicts were,<BR>
Who freed the damsel from that dragon old;<BR>
Spoils, which Sir Sansonet, with many more,<BR>
From Joppa, when he took the city, bore</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Cleansed of their errors in a monastery,<BR>
From whence the odour of good works upwent,<BR>
They of Christ&#8217;s passion every mystery<BR>
Contemplating, through all the churches went;<BR>
Which now, to our eternal infamy,<BR>
Foul Moor usurp; what time on strife intent,<BR>
All Europe rings with arms and martial deeds,<BR>
And war is everywhere but where it needs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
While grace the warlike three devoutly sought,<BR>
Intent on pardon and on pious lore,<BR>
A Grecian pilgrim, known to Gryphon, brought<BR>
Tidings, which ill the afflicted champion bore,<BR>
From his long-cherished vow and former thought,<BR>
Too foreign, too remote; and these so sore<BR>
Inflamed his troubled breast, and bred such care,<BR>
They wholly turned aside his mind from prayer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
For his misfortune, one of lovely feature<BR>
Sir Gryphon worshipped, Origilla hight.<BR>
Of fairer visage and of better stature,<BR>
Not one among a thousand meets the sight:<BR>
But faithless, and of such an evil nature,<BR>
That thou mightst town and city search outright,<BR>
And continent and island, far and near,<BR>
Yet, never, as I think, wouldst find her peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
In Constantine&#8217;s imperial city, burned<BR>
With a fierce fever, he had left the fair;<BR>
And hoped to find her, to that place returned,<BR>
Lovelier than ever; and enjoy her there.<BR>
But she to Antioch (as the warrior learned)<BR>
Had with another leman made repair;<BR>
Thinking, while such fresh youth was yet her own,<BR>
&#8217;Twere not a thing to brook&#8212;to sleep alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
Sir Gryphon, from the time he heard the news<BR>
Had evermore bemoaned him, day or night:<BR>
Whatever pleasure other wight pursues<BR>
Seems but the more to vex his troubled sprite.<BR>
Let each reflect, who to his mischief woos,<BR>
How keenly tempered are Love&#8217;s darts of might,<BR>
And, heavier than all ills, the torment fell,<BR>
In that he was ashamed his grief to tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
This: for that Aquilant had oft before<BR>
Reproved him for the passion which he nursed,<BR>
And sought to banish her from his heart&#8217;s core;<BR>
&#8212;Her, who of all bad women is the worst,<BR>
He still had censured, in his wiser lore,<BR>
If by his brother Aquilant accurst,<BR>
Her Gryphon, in his partial love, excuses,<BR>
For mostly self-conceit our sense abuses.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
It therefore is his purpose, without say<BR>
To Aquilant, alone to take the quest<BR>
As far as Antioch, and bear her away,<BR>
Who had borne off his heart-core from his breast:<BR>
To find him, who had made the dame his prey,<BR>
And take such vengeance of him, ere he rest,<BR>
As shall for aye be told. My next will tell<BR>
How he effected this, and what befell.</TD></TR>
