Guido and his from that foul haunt retire,<BR>
While all Astolpho chases with his horn,<BR>
Who to all quarters of the town sets fire,<BR>
Then roving singly round the world is borne.<BR>
Marphisa, for Gabrina&#8217;s cause, in ire<BR>
Puts upon young Zerbino scathe and scorn,<BR>
And makes him guardian of Gabrina fell,<BR>
From whom he first learns news of Isabel.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Great fears the women of antiquity<BR>
In arms and hallowed arts as well have done,<BR>
And of their worthy works the memory<BR>
And lustre through this ample world has shone.<BR>
Praised is Camilla, with Harpalice,<BR>
For the fair course which they in battle run.<BR>
Corinna and Sappho, famous for their lore,<BR>
Shine two illustrious light, to set no more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Women have reached the pinnacle of glory,<BR>
In every art by them professed, well seen;<BR>
And whosoever turns the leaf of story,<BR>
Finds record of them, neither dim nor mean.<BR>
The evil influence will be transitory,<BR>
If long deprived of such the world had been;<BR>
And envious men, and those that never knew<BR>
Their worth, have haply hid their honours due.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
To me it plainly seems, in this our age<BR>
Of women such is the celebrity,<BR>
That it may furnish matter to the page,<BR>
Whence this dispersed to future years shall be;<BR>
And you, ye evil tongues which foully rage,<BR>
Be tied to your eternal infamy,<BR>
And women&#8217;s praises so resplendent show,<BR>
They shall, by much, Marphisa&#8217;s worth outgo.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
To her returning yet again; the dame<BR>
To him who showed to her such courteous lore,<BR>
Refused not to disclose her martial name,<BR>
Since he agreed to tell the style be bore.<BR>
She quickly satisfied the warrior&#8217;s claim;<BR>
To learn his title she desired so sore.<BR>
&#8220;I am Marphisa,&#8221; the virago cried:<BR>
All else was known, as bruited far and wide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The other, since &#8217;twas his to speak, begun<BR>
With longer preamble: &#8220;Amid your train,<BR>
Sirs, it is my belief that there is none<BR>
But has heard mention of my race and strain.<BR>
Not Pontus, Aethiopia, Ind alone,<BR>
With all their neighbouring realms, but France and Spain<BR>
Wot well of Clermont, from whose loins the knight<BR>
Issued who killed Almontes bold in fight,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And Chiareillo and Mambrino slew,<BR>
And sacked the realm whose royal crown they wore.<BR>
Come of this blood, where Danube&#8217;s waters, through<BR>
Eight horns or ten to meet the Euxine pour,<BR>
Me to the far-renowned Duke Aymon, who<BR>
Thither a stranger roved, my mother bore.<BR>
And &#8217;tis a twelvemonth now since her, in quest<BR>
Of my French kin, I left with grief opprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But reached not France, for southern tempest&#8217;s spite<BR>
Impelled me hither; lodged in royal bower<BR>
Ten months or more; for&#8212;miserable wight!&#8212;<BR>
I reckon every day and every hour.<BR>
Guido the Savage I by name am hight,<BR>
Ill known and scarcely proved in warlike stower.<BR>
Here Argilon of Meliboea I<BR>
Slew with ten warriors in his company.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Conqueror as well in other field confessed,<BR>
Ten ladies are the partners of my bed:<BR>
Selected at my choice, who are the best<BR>
And fairest damsels in this kingdom bred:<BR>
These I command, as well as all the rest,<BR>
Who of their female band have made me head;<BR>
And so would make another who in fight,<BR>
Like me, ten opposites to death would smite.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Sir Guido is besought of them to say<BR>
Why there appear so few of the male race,<BR>
And to declare if women there bear sway<BR>
O&#8217;er men, as men o&#8217;er them in other place.<BR>
He: &#8220;Since my fortune has been here to stay,<BR>
I oftentimes have heard relate the case;<BR>
And now (according to the story told)<BR>
Will, since it pleases you, the cause unfold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When, after twenty years, the Grecian host<BR>
Returned from Troy (ten years hostility<BR>
The town endured, ten weary years were tost<BR>
The Greeks, detained by adverse winds at sea),<BR>
They found their women had, for comforts lost,<BR>
And pangs of absence, learned a remedy;<BR>
And, that they might not freeze alone in bed,<BR>
Chosen young lovers in their husbands&#8217; stead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With others&#8217; children filled the Grecian crew<BR>
Their houses found, and by consent was past<BR>
A pardon to their women; for they knew<BR>
How ill they could endure so long a fast.<BR>
But the adulterous issue, as their due,<BR>
To seek their fortunes on the world were cast:<BR>
Because the husbands would not suffer more<BR>
The striplings should be nourished from their store.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Some are exposed, and others underhand<BR>
Their kindly mothers shelter and maintain:<BR>
While the adults, in many a various band,<BR>
Some here, some there dispersed, their living gain.<BR>
Arms are the trade of some, by some are scanned<BR>
Letters and arts; another tills the plain:<BR>
One serves in court, by other guided go<BR>
The herd as pleases her who rules below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A boy departed with they youthful peers,<BR>
Who was of cruel Clytemnestra born;<BR>
Like lily fresh (he numbered eighteen years)<BR>
Or blooming rose, new-gathered from the thorn.<BR>
He having armed a bark, his pinnace steers<BR>
In search of plunder, o&#8217;er the billows borne.<BR>
With him a hundred other youths engage,<BR>
Picked from all Greece, and of their leader&#8217;s age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The Cretans, who had banished in that day<BR>
Idomeneus the tyrant of their land,<BR>
And their new state to strengthen and upstay,<BR>
Were gathering arms and levying martial band,<BR>
Phalantus&#8217; service by their goodly pay<BR>
Purchased (so hight the youth who sought that strand),<BR>
And all those others that his fortune run,<BR>
Who the Dictaean city garrison.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Amid the hundred cities of old Crete,<BR>
Was the Dictaean the most rich and bright;<BR>
Of fair and amorous dames the joyous seat,<BR>
Joyous with festive sports from morn to night:<BR>
And (as her townsmen aye were wont to greet<BR>
The stranger) with such hospitable rite<BR>
They welcomed these, it little lacked but they<BR>
Granted them o&#8217;er their households sovereign sway.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Youthful and passing fair were all the crew,<BR>
The flower of Greece, who bold Phalantus led;<BR>
So that with those fair ladies at first view,<BR>
Stealing their hearts, full well the striplings sped.<BR>
Since, fair in deed as show, they good and true<BR>
Lovers evinced themselves and bold in bed.<BR>
And in few days to them so grateful proved,<BR>
Above all dearest things they were beloved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;After the war was ended on accord,<BR>
For which were hired Phalantus and his train,<BR>
And pay withdrawn, nor longer by the sword<BR>
Was aught which the adventurous youth can gain,<BR>
And they, for this, anew would go aboard,<BR>
The unhappy Cretan women more complain,<BR>
And fuller tears on this occasion shed,<BR>
That if their fathers lay before them dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Long time and sorely all the striplings bold<BR>
Were, each apart, by them implored to stay:<BR>
Who since the fleeting youths they cannot hold,<BR>
Leave brother, sire, and son, with these to stray,<BR>
Of jewels and of weighty sums of gold<BR>
Spoiling their households ere they wend their way,<BR>
For so well was the plot concealed, no wight<BR>
Throughout all Crete was privy to their flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So happy was the hour, so fair the wind,<BR>
When young Phalantus chose his time to flee,<BR>
They many miles had left the isle behind,<BR>
Ere Crete lamented her calamity.<BR>
Next, uninhabited by human kind,<BR>
This shore received them wandering o&#8217;er the sea.<BR>
&#8217;Twas here they settled, with the plunder reft,<BR>
And better weighed the issue of their theft.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With amorous pleasures teemed this place of rest,<BR>
For ten days, to that roving company:<BR>
But, as oft happens that in youthful breast<BR>
Abundance brings with it satiety,<BR>
To quit their women, with one wish possest,<BR>
The band resolved to win their liberty;<BR>
For never burden does so sore oppress<BR>
As woman, when her love breeds weariness.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;They, who are covetous of spoil and gain,<BR>
And ill-bested withal in stipend, know<BR>
That better means are wanted to maintain<BR>
So many paramours, than shaft and bow;<BR>
And leaving thus alone the wretched train,<BR>
Thence, with their riches charged the adventurers go<BR>
For Puglia&#8217;s pleasant land: there founded near<BR>
The sea, Tarentum&#8217;s city, as I hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The women when they find themselves betrayed<BR>
Of lovers by whose faith they set most store,<BR>
For many days remain so sore dismayed,<BR>
That they seem lifeless statues on the shore.<BR>
But seeing lamentations nothing aid,<BR>
And fruitless are the many tears they pour,<BR>
Begin to meditate, amid their pains,<BR>
What remedy for such an ill remains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Some laying their opinions now before<BR>
The others, deem that to return to Crete<BR>
Is in their sad estate the wiser lore,<BR>
Throwing themselves at sire and husband&#8217;s feet,<BR>
Than in those wilds, and on that desert shore,<BR>
To pine of want. Another troop repeat,<BR>
They should esteem it were a worthier notion<BR>
To cast themselves into the neighbouring ocean;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And lighter ill, if they as harlots went<BR>
About the world,&#8212;beggars or slaves to be,<BR>
Than offer up themselves for punishment,<BR>
Well merited by their iniquity.<BR>
Such and like schemes the unhappy dames present,<BR>
Each harder than the other. Finally,<BR>
One Orontea amid these upstood,<BR>
Who drew her origin from Minos&#8217; blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Youngest and fairest of the crew betrayed<BR>
She was, and wariest, and who least had erred,<BR>
Who to Phalantus&#8217; arms had come a maid,<BR>
And left for him her father: she in word,<BR>
As well as in a kindling face, displayed<BR>
How much with generous wrath her heart was stirred;<BR>
Then, reprobating all advised before,<BR>
Spake; and adopted saw her better lore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She would not leave the land they were upon,<BR>
Whose soil was fruitful, and whose air was sane,<BR>
Throughout which many limpid rivers ran,<BR>
Shaded with woods, and for the most part plain;<BR>
With creek and port, where stranger bark could shun<BR>
Foul wind or storm, which vexed the neighbouring main,<BR>
That might from Afric or from Egypt bring<BR>
Victual or other necessary thing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For vengeance (she opined) they there should stay<BR>
Upon man&#8217;s sex, which had so sore offended.<BR>
She willed each bark and crew which to that bay<BR>
For shelter from the angry tempest wended,<BR>
They should, without remorse, burn, sack, and slay,<BR>
Nor mercy be to any one extended.<BR>
Such was the lady&#8217;s motion, such the course<BR>
Adopted; and the statute put in force.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The women, when they see the changing heaven<BR>
Turbid with tempest, hurry to the strand,<BR>
With savage Orontea, by whom given<BR>
Was the fell law, the ruler of the land;<BR>
And of all barks into their haven driven<BR>
Make havoc dread with fire and murderous brand,<BR>
Leaving no man alive, who may diffuse<BR>
Upon this side or that the dismal news.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Twas thus with the male sex at enmity,<BR>
Some years the lonely women lived forlorn:<BR>
Then found that hurtful to themselves would be<BR>
The scheme, save changed; for if from them were born<BR>
None to perpetuate their empery,<BR>
The idle law would soon be held in scorn,<BR>
And fail together with the fruitful reign,<BR>
Which they had hoped eternal should remain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So that some deal its rigour they allay,<BR>
And in four years, of all who made repair<BR>
Thither, by chance conducted to this bay,<BR>
Chose out ten vigorous cavaliers and fair;<BR>
That for endurance in the amorous play<BR>
Against those hundred dames good champions were:<BR>
A hundred they; and, of the chosen men,<BR>
A husband was assigned to every ten.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ere this, too feeble to abide the test,<BR>
Many a one on scaffold lost his head.<BR>
Now these ten warriors so approved the best,<BR>
Were made partakers of their rule and bed;<BR>
First swearing at the sovereign ladies&#8217; hest,<BR>
That they, if others to that port are led,<BR>
No mercy shall to any one afford,<BR>
But one and all will put them to the sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To swell, and next to child, and thence to fear<BR>
The women turned to teeming wives began<BR>
Lest they in time so many males should bear<BR>
As might invade the sovereignty they plan,<BR>
And that the government they hold so dear<BR>
Might finally from them revert to man.<BR>
And so, while these are children yet, take measure,<BR>
They never shall rebel against their pleasure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That the male sex may not usurp the sway,<BR>
It is enacted by the statute fell,<BR>
Each mother should one boy preserve, and slay<BR>
The others, or abroad exchange or sell.<BR>
For this, they these to various parts convey,<BR>
And to the bearers of the children tell,<BR>
To truck the girls for boys in foreign lands,<BR>
Or not, at least, return with empty hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor by the women one preserved would be,<BR>
If they without them could the race maintain.<BR>
Such all their mercy, all the clemency<BR>
The law accords for theirs, not others&#8217; gain.<BR>
The dames all others sentence equally;<BR>
And temper but in this their statute&#8217;s pain,<BR>
That, not as was their former practice, they<BR>
All in their rage promiscuously slay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Did ten or twenty persons, or yet more,<BR>
Arrive, they were imprisoned and put by;<BR>
And every day one only from the store<BR>
Of victims was brought out by lot to die,<BR>
In fane by Orontea built, before<BR>
An altar raised to Vengeance; and to ply<BR>
As headsman, and dispatched the unhappy men,<BR>
One was by lot selected from the ten.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To that foul murderous shore by chance did fare,<BR>
After long years elapsed, a youthful wight,<BR>
Whose fathers sprung from good Alcides were,<BR>
And he, of proof in arms, Elbanio hight;<BR>
There was he seized, of peril scarce aware,<BR>
As unsuspecting such a foul despite:<BR>
And, closely guarded, into prison flung,<BR>
Kept for like cruel use the rest among.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Adorned with every fair accomplishment,<BR>
Of pleasing face and manners was the peer,<BR>
And of a speech so sweet and eloquent,<BR>
Him the deaf adder might have stopt to hear;<BR>
So that of him to Alexandria went<BR>
Tidings as of a precious thing and rare.<BR>
She was the daughter of that matron bold,<BR>
Queen Orontea, that yet lived, though old.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet Orontea lived, while of that shore<BR>
The other settlers all were dead and gone;<BR>
And now ten times as many such or more<BR>
Had into strength and greater credit grown.<BR>
Nor for ten forges, often closed, in store<BR>
Have the ill-furnished band more files than one;<BR>
And the ten champions have as well the care<BR>
To welcome shrewdly all who thither fare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Young Alexandria, who the blooming peer<BR>
Burned to behold so praised on every part,<BR>
The special pleasure him to see and hear,<BR>
Won from her mother; and, about to part<BR>
From him, discovers that the cavalier<BR>
Remains the master of her tortured heart;<BR>
Finds herself bound, and that &#8217;tis vain to stir,<BR>
&#8212;A captive made by her own prisoner.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I pity,&#8217; (said Elbanio) &#8216;lady fair,<BR>
Was in this cruel region known, as through<BR>
All other countries near or distant, where<BR>
The wandering sun sheds light and colouring hue,<BR>
I by your beauty&#8217;s kindly charms should dare<BR>
(Which make each gentle spirit bound to you)<BR>
To beg my life; which always, at your will,<BR>
Should I be ready for your love to spill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;But since deprived of all humanity<BR>
Are human bosoms in this cruel land,<BR>
I shall not now request my life of thee,<BR>
(For fruitless would, I know, be the demand)<BR>
But, whether a good knight or bad I be,<BR>
Ask but like such to die with arms in hand,<BR>
And not as one condemned to penal pain;<BR>
Or like brute beast in sacrifice be slain.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The gentle maid, her eye bedimmed with tear,<BR>
In pity for the hapless youth, replied:<BR>
&#8216;Though this land be more cruel and severe<BR>
Than any other country, far and wide,<BR>
Each woman is not a Medaea here<BR>
As thou wouldst make her; and, if all beside<BR>
Were of such evil kind, in me alone<BR>
Should an exception to the rest be known.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And though I, like so many here, of yore<BR>
Was full of evil deeds and cruelty,<BR>
I can well say, I never had before<BR>
A fitting subject for my clemency.<BR>
But fiercer were I than a tiger, more<BR>
Hard were my heart than diamonds, if in me<BR>
All hardness did not vanish and give place<BR>
Before your courage, gentleness, and grace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Ah! were the cruel statute less severe<BR>
Against the stranger to these shores conveyed!<BR>
So should I not esteem my death too dear<BR>
A ransom for thy worthier life were paid.<BR>
But none is here so great, sir cavalier,<BR>
Nor of such puissance as to lend thee aid;<BR>
And what thou askest, though a scanty grace,<BR>
Were difficult to compass in this place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And yet will I endeavour to obtain<BR>
For thee, before thou perish, this content;<BR>
Though much, I fear, &#8217;twill but augment thy pain.<BR>
And thee protracted death but more torment.&#8217;<BR>
&#8216;So I the ten encounter,&#8217; (said again<BR>
Elbanio), &#8216;I at heart, am confident<BR>
Myself to save, and enemies to slay;<BR>
Though made of iron were the whole array.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To this the youthful Alexandria nought<BR>
Made answer, saving with a piteous sigh;<BR>
And from the conference a bosom brought,<BR>
Gored with deep wounds, beyond all remedy.<BR>
To Orontea she repaired, and wrought<BR>
On her to will the stripling should not die,<BR>
Should he display such courage and such skill<BR>
As with his single hand the ten to kill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Queen Orontea straightway bade unite<BR>
Her council, and bespoke the assembled band:<BR>
&#8216;It still behoves us place the prowest wight<BR>
Whom we can find, to guard our ports and strand.<BR>
And, to discover whom to take or slight,<BR>
&#8217;Tis fitting that we prove the warrior&#8217;s hand;<BR>
Lest, to our loss, the election made be wrong,<BR>
And we enthrone the weak and slay the strong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I deem it fit, if you the counsel shown<BR>
Deem fit as well, in future to ordain,<BR>
That each upon our coast by Fortune thrown,<BR>
Before he in the temple shall be slain,<BR>
Shall have the choice, instead of this, alone<BR>
Battle against ten others to maintain;<BR>
And if he conquer, shall the port defend<BR>
With other comrades, pardoned to that end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I say this, since to strive against our ten,<BR>
It seems, that one imprisoned here will dare:<BR>
Who, if he stands against so many men,<BR>
By Heaven, deserves that we should hear his prayer;<BR>
But if he rashly boasts himself, again<BR>
As worthily due the punishment should bear.&#8217;<BR>
Here Orontea ceased; on the other side,<BR>
To her the oldest of the dames replied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;The leading cause, for which to entertain<BR>
This intercourse with men we first agreed,<BR>
Was not because we, to defend this reign,<BR>
Of their assistance stood in any need;<BR>
For we have skill and courage to maintain<BR>
This of ourselves, and force, withal, to speed.<BR>
Would that we could in all as well avail<BR>
Without their succour, nor succession fail!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;But since this may not be, we some have made<BR>
(These few) partakers of our company;<BR>
That, ten to one, we be not overlaid;<BR>
Nor they possess them of the sovereignty.<BR>
Not that we for protection need their aid,<BR>
But simply to increase and multiply.<BR>
Than be their powers to this sole fear addressed,<BR>
And be they sluggards, idle for the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;To keep among us such a puissant wight<BR>
Our first design would render wholly vain.<BR>
If one can singly slay ten men in fight,<BR>
How many women can he not restrain?<BR>
If our ten champions had possessed such might,<BR>
They the first day would have usurped the reign.<BR>
To arm a hand more powerful than your own<BR>
Is an ill method to maintain the throne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Reflect withal, that if your prisoner speed<BR>
So that he kill ten champions in the fray,<BR>
A hundred women&#8217;s cry, whose lords will bleed<BR>
Beneath his falchion, shall your ears dismay.<BR>
Let him not &#8217;scape by such a murderous deed;<BR>
But, if he would, propound some other way.<BR>
&#8212;Yet if he of those ten supply the place,<BR>
And please a hundred women, grant him grace.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This was severe Artemia&#8217;s sentiment,<BR>
(So was she named) and had her counsel weighed,<BR>
Elbanio to the temple had been sent,<BR>
To perish by the sacrificial blade.<BR>
But Orontea, willing to content<BR>
Her daughter, to the matron answer made;<BR>
And urged so many reasons, and so wrought,<BR>
The yielding senate granted what she ought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Elbanio&#8217;s beauty (for so fair to view<BR>
Never was any cavalier beside)<BR>
So strongly works upon the youthful crew,<BR>
Which in that council sit the state to guide,<BR>
That the opinion of the older few<BR>
That like Artemia think, is set aside;<BR>
And little lacks but that the assembled race<BR>
Absolve Elbanio by especial grace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To pardon him in fine the dames agreed:<BR>
But, after slaying his half-score, and when<BR>
He in the next assault as well should speech,<BR>
Not with a hundred women, but with ten;<BR>
And, furnished to his wish with arms and steed,<BR>
Next day he was released from dungeon-den,<BR>
And singly with ten warriors matched in plain,<BR>
Who by his arm successively were slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He to new proof was put the following night,<BR>
Against ten damsels naked and alone;<BR>
When so successful was the stripling&#8217;s might,<BR>
He took the &#8217;say of all the troop, and won<BR>
Such grace with Orontea, that the knight<BR>
Was by the dame adopted for her son;<BR>
And from her Alexandria had to wife,<BR>
With those whom he had proved in amorous strife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And him she left with Alexandria, heir<BR>
To this famed city, which from her was hight,<BR>
So he and all who his successors were,<BR>
Should guard the law which willed, whatever wight,<BR>
Conducted hither by his cruel star,<BR>
Upon this miserable land did light,<BR>
Should have his choice to perish by the knife,<BR>
Or singly with ten foes contend to strife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if he should dispatch the men by day,<BR>
At night should prove him with the female crew;<BR>
And if so fortunate that in this play<BR>
He proved again the conqueror, he, as due,<BR>
The female band, as prince and guide, should sway,<BR>
And his ten consorts at his choice renew:<BR>
And reign with them, till other should arrive<BR>
Of stouter hand, and him of life deprive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;They for two thousand years nigh past away<BR>
This usage have maintained, and yet maintain<BR>
The impious rite; and rarely passes day<BR>
But stranger wight is slaughtered in the fane.<BR>
If he, Elbanio-like, ten foes assay,<BR>
(And such sometimes is found) he oft is slain<BR>
In the first charge: nor, in a thousand, one<BR>
The other feat, of which I spake, has done,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet some there are have done it, though so few,<BR>
They may be numbered on the fingers; one<BR>
Of the victorious cavaliers, but who<BR>
Reigned with his ten short time, was Argilon:<BR>
For, smote by me, whom ill wind hither blew,<BR>
The knight to his eternal rest is gone.<BR>
Would I with him that day had filled a grave,<BR>
Rather than in such scorn survive a slave!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For amorous pleasures, laughter, game, and play,<BR>
Which evermore delight the youthful breast;<BR>
The gem, the purple garment, rich array,<BR>
And in his city place before the rest.<BR>
Little, by Heaven, the wretched man appay<BR>
Who of his liberty is dispossest:<BR>
And not to have the power to leave this shore<BR>
To me seems shameful servitude and sore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To know I wear away life&#8217;s glorious spring<BR>
In such effeminate and slothful leisure<BR>
Is to my troubled heart a constant sting,<BR>
And takes away the taste of every pleasure.<BR>
Fame bears my kindred&#8217;s praise on outstretched wing,<BR>
Even to the skies; and haply equal measure<BR>
I of the glories of my blood might share<BR>
If I united with my brethren were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Methinks my fate does such injurious deed<BR>
By me, condemned to servitude so base,<BR>
As he who turns to grass the generous steed<BR>
To run amid the herd of meaner race,<BR>
Because unfit for war or worthier meed,<BR>
Through blemish, or disease of sight or pace.<BR>
Nor hoping but by death, alas! to fly<BR>
So vile a service, I desire to die.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Here Guido ceased to address the martial peers,<BR>
And cursed withal the day, in high disdain,<BR>
That he achieved o&#8217;er dames and cavaliers<BR>
The double victory which bestowed that reign.<BR>
Astolpho hides his name, and silent hears,<BR>
Until to him by many a sign is plain<BR>
That this Sir Guido is, as he had said,<BR>
The issue of his kinsman Aymon&#8217;s bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Then cried: &#8220;The English duke, Astolpho, I<BR>
Thy cousin am,&#8221; and clipt him round the waist,<BR>
And in a kindly act of courtesy,<BR>
Not without weeping, kist him and embraced.<BR>
Then, &#8220;Kinsman dear, thy birth to certify<BR>
No better sign thy mother could have placed<BR>
About thy neck. Enough! that sword of thine,<BR>
And courage, vouch thee of our valiant line.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Guido, who gladly would in other place<BR>
So near a kin have welcomed, in dismay<BR>
Beholds him here and with a mournful face;<BR>
Knowing, if he himself survives the fray,<BR>
Astolpho will be doomed to slavery base,<BR>
His fate deferred but till the following day;<BR>
And he shall perish, if the duke is free:<BR>
So that one&#8217;s good the other&#8217;s ill shall be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
He grieves, as well, the other cavaliers<BR>
Should through his means for ever captive be;<BR>
Nor, that he should, if slain, those martial peers<BR>
Deliver by his death from slavery.<BR>
Since if Marphisa from one quicksand clears<BR>
The troop, yet these from other fails to free,<BR>
She will have won the victory in vain;<BR>
For they will be enslaved, and she be slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
On the other hand, the stripling&#8217;s age, in May<BR>
Of youth, with courtesy and valour fraught,<BR>
Upon the maid and comrades with such sway,<BR>
Touching their breasts with love and pity, wrought<BR>
That they of freedom, for which he must pay<BR>
The forfeit of his life, nigh loathed the thought;<BR>
And if Marphisa him perforce must kill,<BR>
She is resolved as well herself to spill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Join thou with us,&#8221; she to Sir Guido cried,<BR>
&#8220;And we from hence will sally.&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;From within<BR>
These walls to sally&#8221;&#8212;Guido on his side<BR>
Answered, &#8220;Ne&#8217;er hope: With me you lose or win.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;&#8212;I fear not, I,&#8221; the martial maid replied,<BR>
&#8220;To execute whatever I begin;<BR>
Nor know what can securer path afford<BR>
Than that which I shall open with my sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Such proof of thy fair prowess have I made,<BR>
With thee I every enterprise would dare.<BR>
To-morrow when about the palisade<BR>
The crowds assembled in the circus are,<BR>
Let us on every side the mob invade,<BR>
Whether they fly or for defence prepare;<BR>
Then give the town to fire, and on their bed<BR>
Of earth to wolf and vulture leave the dead.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
He: &#8220;Ready shalt thou find me in the strife<BR>
To follow thee or perish at thy side:<BR>
But let us hope not to escape with life.<BR>
Enough, is vengeance somedeal satisfied<BR>
Ere death; for oft ten thousand, maid and wife,<BR>
I in the place have witnessed; and, outside,<BR>
As many castle, wall and port, defend.<BR>
Nor know I certain way from hence to wend.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And were there more (Marphisa made reply)<BR>
Than Xerxes led, our squadrons to oppose,<BR>
More than those rebel spirits from the sky<BR>
Cast out to dwell amid perpetual woes,<BR>
All in one day should by this weapon die,<BR>
Wert thou with me, at least, not with my foes.&#8221;<BR>
To her again, &#8220;No project but must fail,<BR>
(Sir Guido said) I know, save this avail.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This only us can save, should it succeed;<BR>
This, which but now remembered I shall teach.<BR>
To dames alone our laws the right concede<BR>
To sally, or set foot upon the beach,<BR>
And hence to one of mine in this our need<BR>
Must I commit myself, and aid beseech;<BR>
Whose love for me, by perfect friendship tied,<BR>
Has oft by better proof than this been tried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No less than me would she desire that I<BR>
Should &#8217;scape from slavery, so she went with me;<BR>
And that, without her rival&#8217;s company,<BR>
She of my lot should sole partaker be.<BR>
She bark or pinnace, in the harbour nigh,<BR>
Shall bid, while yet &#8217;tis dark, prepare for sea;<BR>
Which shall await your sailors, rigged and yare<BR>
For sailing, when they thither shall repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Behind me, in a solid band comprest,<BR>
Ye merchants, mariners and warriors, who,<BR>
Driven to this city, have set up your rest<BR>
Beneath this roof (for which my thanks are due)<BR>
&#8212;You have to force your way with stedfast breast,<BR>
If adversaries interrupt our crew.<BR>
&#8217;Tis thus I hope, by succour of the sword,<BR>
To clear a passage through the cruel horde.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Do as thou wilt,&#8221; Marphisa made reply,<BR>
&#8220;I of escape am confident withal:<BR>
And likelier &#8217;twere that by my hand should die<BR>
The martial race, encompassed by this wall,<BR>
Than any one should ever see me fly,<BR>
Or guess by other sign that fears appall.<BR>
I would my passage force in open day,<BR>
And shameful in my sight were other way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I wot if I were for a woman known,<BR>
Honour and place from women I might claim,<BR>
Here gladly entertained, and classed as one<BR>
Haply among their chiefs of highest fame:<BR>
But privilege or favour will I none<BR>
Unshared by those with whom I hither came.<BR>
Too base it were, did I depart or free<BR>
Remain, to leave the rest in slavery.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
These speeches by Marphisa made, and more,<BR>
Showed that what only had restrained her arm<BR>
Was the respect she to the safety bore<BR>
Of the companions whom her wrath might harm;<BR>
By this alone withheld form taking sore<BR>
And signal vengeance on the female swarm.<BR>
And hence she left in Guido&#8217;s care to shape<BR>
What seemed the fittest means for their escape.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Sir Guido speaks that night with Alery<BR>
(So the most faithful of his wives was hight)<BR>
Nor needs long prayer to make the dame agree,<BR>
Disposed already to obey the knight.<BR>
She takes a ship and arms the bark for sea,<BR>
Stowed with her richest chattels for their flight;<BR>
Feigning design, as soon as dawn ensues,<BR>
To sail with her companions on a cruise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
She into Guido&#8217;s palace had before<BR>
Bid sword and spear and shield and cuirass bear;<BR>
With the intent to furnish from this store,<BR>
Merchants and sailors that half naked were.<BR>
Some watch, and some repose upon the floor,<BR>
And rest and guard among each other share;<BR>
Oft marking, still with harness on their backs,<BR>
If ruddy yet with light the orient wax.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Not yet from earth&#8217;s hard visage has the sun<BR>
Lifted her veil of dim and dingy dye;<BR>
Scarcely Lycaon&#8217;s child, her furrow done,<BR>
Has turned about her ploughshare in the sky;<BR>
When to the theatre the women run<BR>
Who would the fearful battle&#8217;s end espy,<BR>
As swarming bees upon their threshold cluster,<BR>
Who bent on change of realm in springtide muster.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
With warlike trumpet, drum, and sound of horn,<BR>
The people make the land and welkin roar;<BR>
Summoning thus their chieftain to return,<BR>
And end of unfinished warfare. Covered o&#8217;er<BR>
With arms stand Aquilant and Gryphon stern,<BR>
And the redoubted duke from England&#8217;s shore.<BR>
Marphisa, Dudo, Sansonet, and all<BR>
The knights or footmen harboured in that hall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Hence to descend towards the sea or port<BR>
The way across the place of combat lies;<BR>
Nor was there other passage, long or short.<BR>
Sir Guido so to his companions cries:<BR>
And having ceased his comrades to exhort,<BR>
To do their best set forth in silent wise,<BR>
And in the place appeared, amid the throng,<BR>
Head of a squad above a hundred strong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Toward the other gate Sir Guido went,<BR>
Hurrying his band, but, gathered far and nigh<BR>
The mighty multitude, for aye intent<BR>
To smite, and clad in arms, when they descry<BR>
The comrades whom he leads, perceive his bent,<BR>
And truly deem he is about to fly.<BR>
All in a thought betake them to their bows,<BR>
And at the portal part the knight oppose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Sir Guido and the cavaliers who go<BR>
Beneath that champion&#8217;s guidance, and before<BR>
The others bold Marphisa, were not slow<BR>
To strike, and laboured hard to force the door.<BR>
But such a storm of darts from ready bow,<BR>
Dealing on all sides death or wounding sore,<BR>
Was rained in fury on the troop forlorn,<BR>
They feared at last to encounter skaith and scorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Of proof the corslet was each warrior wore,<BR>
Who without this would have had worse to fear:<BR>
Sansonnet&#8217;s horse was slain, and that which bore<BR>
Marphisa: to himself the English peer<BR>
Exclaimed, &#8220;Why wait I longer? As if more<BR>
My horn could ever succour me than here.<BR>
Since the sword steads not, I will make assay<BR>
If with my bugle I can clear the way.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
As he was customed in extremity,<BR>
He to his mouth applied the bugle&#8217;s round;<BR>
The wide world seemed to tremble, earth and sky,<BR>
As he in air discharged the horrid sound.<BR>
Such terror smote the dames, that bent to fly,<BR>
When in their ears the deafening horn was wound,<BR>
Not only they the gate unguarded left,<BR>
But from the circus reeled, of wit bereft.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
As family, awaked in sudden wise,<BR>
Leaps from the windows and from lofty height,<BR>
Periling life and limb, when in surprise<BR>
They see, now near, the fire&#8217;s encircling light,<BR>
Which had, while slumber sealed their heavy eyes,<BR>
By little and by little waxed at night:<BR>
Reckless of life, thus each, impelled by dread,<BR>
At sound of that appalling bugle fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Above, below, and here and there, the rout<BR>
Rise in confusion and attempt to fly.<BR>
At once, above a thousand swarm about<BR>
Each entrance, to each other&#8217;s lett, and lie<BR>
In heaps: from window these, or stage without,<BR>
Leap headlong; in the press these smothered die.<BR>
Broken is many an arm, and many a head;<BR>
And one lies crippled, and another dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Amid the mighty ruin which ensued,<BR>
Cries pierce the very heavens on every part.<BR>
Where&#8217;er the sound is heard, the multitude,<BR>
In panic at the deafening echo, start.<BR>
When you are told that without hardihood<BR>
Appear the rabble, and of feeble heart,<BR>
This need not more your marvel; for by nature<BR>
The hare is evermore a timid creature.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
But of Marphisa what will be your thought,<BR>
And Guido late so furious?&#8212;of the two<BR>
Young sons of Olivier, that lately wrought<BR>
Such deeds in honour of their lineage? who<BR>
Lately a hundred thousand held as nought,<BR>
And now, deprived of courage, basely flew,<BR>
As ring-doves flutter and as coneys fly,<BR>
Who hear some mighty noise resounding nigh.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
For so to friend as stranger, noxious are<BR>
The powers that in the enchanted horn reside.<BR>
Sansonet, Guido, follow, with the pair<BR>
Or brethren bold, Marphisa terrified.<BR>
Nor flying, can they to such distance fare,<BR>
But that their ears are dinned. On every side<BR>
Astolpho, on his foaming courser borne,<BR>
Lends louder breath to his enchanted horn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
One sought the sea, and one the mountain-top,<BR>
One fled the hide herself in forest hoar;<BR>
And this, who turned not once nor made a stop,<BR>
Not for ten days her headlong flight forbore:<BR>
These from the bridge in that dread moment drop,<BR>
Never to climb the river&#8217;s margin more.<BR>
So temple, house and square and street were drained,<BR>
That nigh unpeopled the wide town remained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, Guido, and the brethren two,<BR>
With Sansonetto, pale and trembling, hie<BR>
Towards the sea, and behind these the crew<BR>
Of frighted mariners and merchants fly;<BR>
And &#8217;twixt the forts, in bark, prepared with view<BR>
To their escape, discover Alery;<BR>
Who in sore haste receives the warriors pale,<BR>
And bids them ply their oars and make all sail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
The duke within and out the town had bear<BR>
From the surrounding hills to the sea-side,<BR>
And of its people emptied every street.<BR>
All fly before the deafening sound, and hide:<BR>
Many in panic, seeking a retreat,<BR>
Lurk, in some place obscure and filthy stied;<BR>
Many, not knowing whither to repair,<BR>
Plunge in the neighbouring sea, and perish there.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
The duke arrives, seeking the friendly band,<BR>
Whom he had hoped to find upon the quay;<BR>
He turns and gazes round the desert strand,<BR>
And none is there&#8212;directs along the bay<BR>
His eyes, and now, far distant from the land,<BR>
Beholds the parting frigate under way.<BR>
So that the paladin, for his escape&#8212;<BR>
The vessel gone&#8212;must other project shape.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Let him depart! nor let it trouble you<BR>
That he so long a road must beat alone;<BR>
Where, never without fear, man journeys through<BR>
Wild paynim countries: danger is there none,<BR>
But what he with his bugle may eschew,<BR>
Whose dread effect the English duke has shown;<BR>
And let his late companions be our care,<BR>
Who trembling to the beach had made repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
They from that cruel and ensanguined ground<BR>
To seaward, under all their canvas, bore;<BR>
And having gained such offing, that the sound<BR>
Of that alarming horn was heard no more,<BR>
Unwonted shame inflicted such a wound,<BR>
That all a face of burning crimson wore.<BR>
One dares not eye the other, and they stand<BR>
With downcast looks, a mute and mournful band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Fixed on his course, the pilot passes by<BR>
Cyprus and Rhodes, and ploughs the Aegean sea:<BR>
Beholds a hundred islands from him fly,<BR>
And Malea&#8217;s fearful headland; fanned by free<BR>
And constant wind, sees vanish from the eye<BR>
The Greek Morea; rounding Sicily,<BR>
Into the Tuscan sea his frigate veers,<BR>
And, coasting Italy&#8217;s fair region, steers:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Last rises Luna, where his family<BR>
Is waiting his return, the patron hoar<BR>
Gives thanks to God at having passed the sea<BR>
Without more harm, and makes the well-known shore.<BR>
Here, offering passage to their company,<BR>
They find a master, ready to unmoor<BR>
For France, and that same day his pinnace climb;<BR>
Thence wafted to Marseilles in little time.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
There was not Bradamant, who used to sway<BR>
The land, and had that city in her care,<BR>
And who (if present there) to make some stay<BR>
Would have compelled them by her courteous prayer.<BR>
They disembarked; and that same hour away<BR>
Did bold Marphisa at a venture fare;<BR>
Bidding adieu to salvage Guido&#8217;s wife,<BR>
And to the four, her comrades in the strife:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
Saying she deems unfitting for a knight<BR>
To fare in like great fellowship; that so<BR>
The starlings and the doves in flock unite,<BR>
And every beast who fears&#8212;the stag and doe;<BR>
But hawk and eagle, that in other&#8217;s might<BR>
Put not their trust, for ever singly go;<BR>
And lion, bear, and tyger, roam alone,<BR>
Who fear no prowess greater than their own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
But none with her opine, and, in the lack<BR>
Of a companion, singly must she fare,<BR>
So then, alone and friendless, she a track<BR>
Uncouth pursues, and through a wooded lair.<BR>
Gryphon the white and Aquilant the black<BR>
Take road more beaten with the other pair;<BR>
And on the following day a castle see,<BR>
Within which they are harboured courteously.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
Courteously I, in outward show, would say;<BR>
For soon the contrary was made appear.<BR>
Since he, the castellain, who with display<BR>
Of kindness sheltered them and courteous cheer,<BR>
The night ensuing took them as they lay<BR>
Couched in their beds, secure and void of fear.<BR>
Nor from the snare would he his prisoners loose,<BR>
Till they had sworn to observe an evil use.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
But I will first pursue the martial maid,<BR>
Ere more of these, fair sir, I shall proclaim.<BR>
Beyond the Durence, Rhone, and Saone she strayed,<BR>
And to the foot of sunny mountain came;<BR>
And there approaching in black gown arrayed,<BR>
Beside a torrent, saw an ancient dame;<BR>
Who with long journey weak, and wearied sore,<BR>
Appeared, but pined by melancholy more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
This was the beldam who had wont to ply<BR>
Serving the robbers in the caverned mount;<BR>
Whither stern Justice sent (that they might die<BR>
By that good paladin) Anglante&#8217;s count.<BR>
The aged harridan, for cause which I<BR>
To you shall in another place recount,<BR>
Now many days by path obscure had flown,<BR>
Still fearing lest her visage should be known.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
The semblance now of foreign cavalier<BR>
She in Marphisa saw, in arms and vest;<BR>
And hence she flies not her, though wont to fear,<BR>
(As being natives of that land) the rest;<BR>
&#8212;Nay, with security and open cheer,<BR>
Stops at the ford the damsel to arrest:<BR>
Stops at the ford&#8212;where that old beldam meets<BR>
Marphisa, and with fair encounter greets.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
And next implored the maid, she of her grace<BR>
Would bear her on the croupe to the other shore.<BR>
Marphisa, who was come of gentle race,<BR>
The hag with her across the torrent bore;<BR>
And is content to bear, till she can place<BR>
In a securer road the beldam hoar,<BR>
Clear of a spacious marish: as its end<BR>
They see a cavalier towards them wend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
In shining armour and in fair array,<BR>
The warrior rode on saddle richly wrought<BR>
Towards the river, and upon his way<BR>
With him a single squire and damsel brought.<BR>
Of passing beauty was the lady gay,<BR>
But little pleasing was her semblance haught;<BR>
All overblown with insolence and pride,<BR>
Worthy the cavalier who was her guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
He of Maganza was a count, who bore<BR>
The lady with him (Pinabello hight):<BR>
The same who Bradamant, some months before,<BR>
Had plunged into a hollow cave in spite.<BR>
Those many sobs, those burning sighs and sore,<BR>
Those tears which had nigh quenched the warrior&#8217;s sight,&#8212;<BR>
All for the damsel were, now at his side;<BR>
And then by that false necromancer stied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
But when the magic tower upon the hill<BR>
Was razed, the dwelling of Atlantes hoar,<BR>
And every one was free to rove at will,<BR>
Through Bradamant&#8217;s good deed and virtuous lore,<BR>
The damsel, who had been compliant still<BR>
With the desires of Pinabel before,<BR>
Rejoined him, and now journeying in a round<BR>
With him, from castle was to castle bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
As wanton and ill-customed, when she spies<BR>
Marphisa&#8217;s aged charge approaching near,<BR>
She cannot rein her saucy tongue, but plies<BR>
Here, in her petulance, with laugh and jeer.<BR>
Marphisa haught, unwont in any wise<BR>
Outrage from whatsoever part to hear,<BR>
Makes answer to the dame, in angry tone,<BR>
That handsomer than her she deems the crone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
And that she this would prove upon her knight<BR>
With pact that she might strip the bonnibell<BR>
Of gown and palfrey, if, o&#8217;erthrown in fight,<BR>
Her champion from his goodly courser fell.<BR>
&#8212;In silence to have overpast the slight<BR>
Would have been sin and shame in Pinabel,<BR>
Who for short answer seized his shield and spear,<BR>
And wheeled, and drove at her in fierce career.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa grasped a mighty lance, and thrust,<BR>
Encountering him, at Pinabello&#8217;s eyes;<BR>
And stretched him so astounded in the dust,<BR>
That motionless an hour the warrior lies.<BR>
Marphisa, now victorious in the just,<BR>
Gave orders to strip off the glorious guise<BR>
And ornaments wherewith the maid was drest,<BR>
And with the spoils her ancient crone invest;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
And willed that she should don the youthful weed,<BR>
Bedizened at the haughty damsel&#8217;s cost;<BR>
And took away as well the goodly steed<BR>
Which her had thither borne, and&#8212;bent to post<BR>
On her old track&#8212;with her the hag will speed,<BR>
Who seems most hideous when adorned the most.<BR>
Three days the tedious road the couple beat,<BR>
Without adventure needful to repeat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
On the fourth day they met a cavalier,<BR>
Who came in fury galloping alone.<BR>
If you the stranger&#8217;s name desire to hear,<BR>
I tell you &#8217;twas Zerbino, a king&#8217;s son,<BR>
Of beauty and of worth example rare,<BR>
Now grieved and angered, as unvenged of one,<BR>
Who a great act of courtesy, which fain<BR>
The warrior would have done, had rendered vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
Vainly the young Zerbino, through the glade,<BR>
Had chased that man of his, who this despite<BR>
Had done him, who himself so well conveyed<BR>
Away and took such &#8217;vantage in his flight,<BR>
So hid by wood and mist, which overlaid<BR>
The horizon and bedimmed the morning-light,<BR>
That he escaped Zerbino&#8217;s grasp, and lay<BR>
Concealed until his wrath was past away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
Zerbino laughed parforce, when he descried<BR>
That beldam&#8217;s face, though he was full of rage;<BR>
For too ill-sorted seemed her vest of pride<BR>
With her foul visage, more deformed by age;<BR>
And to the proud Marphisa, at her side<BR>
The prince, exclaimed, &#8220;Sir warrior, you are sage,<BR>
In having chosen damsel of a sort,<BR>
Whom none, I ween, will grudge you should escort.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
Older than Sibyl seemed the beldam hoar,<BR>
(As far as from her wrinkles one might guess),<BR>
And in the youthful ornaments she wore,<BR>
Looked like an ape which men in mockery dress;<BR>
And now appears more foul, as angered sore,<BR>
While rage and wrath her kindled eyes express.<BR>
For none can do a woman worse despite<BR>
Than to proclaim her old and foul to sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
To have sport of him&#8212;as she had&#8212;an air<BR>
Of wrath the maid assumed upon her part,<BR>
And to the prince, &#8220;By Heaven, more passing fair<BR>
Is this my lady than thou courteous art,&#8221;<BR>
Exclaimed in answer; &#8220;though I am aware<BR>
What thou hast uttered comes not from thy heart.<BR>
Thou wilt not own her beauty; a device<BR>
Put on to masque thy sovereign cowardice.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And of what stamp would be that cavalier<BR>
Who found such fair and youthful dame alone,<BR>
Without protection, in the forest drear,<BR>
Nor sought to make the lovely weft his own?&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;So well she sorts with thee,&#8221; replied the peer,<BR>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Twere ill that she were claimed by any one:<BR>
Nor I of her would thee in any wise<BR>
Deprive; God rest thee merry with thy prize!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But would thou prove what is my chivalry,<BR>
On other ground I to thy wish incline;<BR>
Yet deem me not of such perversity<BR>
As to tilt with thee for this prize of thine.<BR>
Or fair or foul, let her remain thy fee;<BR>
I would not, I, such amity disjoin.<BR>
Well are ye paired, and safely would I swear<BR>
That thou as valiant art as she is fair.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
To him Marphisa, &#8220;Thou in thy despite<BR>
Shalt try to bear from me the dame away.<BR>
I will not suffer that so fair a sight<BR>
Thou shouldst behold, nor seek to gain the prey.&#8221;<BR>
To her the prince, &#8220;I know not wherefore wight<BR>
Should suffer pain and peril in affray,<BR>
Striving for victory, where, for his pains,<BR>
The victor losses, and the vanquished gains.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If this condition please not, other course<BR>
Which ill thou canst refuse, I offer thee,&#8221;<BR>
(Marphisa cried): &#8220;If thou shalt me unhorse<BR>
In this our tourney, she remains with me:<BR>
But if I win, I give her thee parforce.<BR>
Then prove we now who shall without her be.<BR>
Premised, if loser, thou shalt be her guide,<BR>
Wherever it may please the dame to ride.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And be it so,&#8221; Zerbino cried, and wheeled<BR>
Swiftly his foaming courser for the shock,<BR>
And rising in his stirrups scowered the field,<BR>
Firm in his seat, and smote, with levelled stock,<BR>
For surer aim, the damsel in mid-shield;<BR>
But she sate stedfast as a metal rock,<BR>
And at the warrior&#8217;s morion thrust so well,<BR>
She clean out-bore him senseless from the sell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
Much grieved the prince, to whom in other fray<BR>
The like misfortune had not chanced before,<BR>
Who had unhorsed some thousands in his day:<BR>
Now shamed, he thought for ever. Troubled sore,<BR>
And mute long space upon the ground he lay,<BR>
And, when &#8217;twas recollected, grieved the more,<BR>
That he had promised, and that he was bound,<BR>
To accompany the hag where&#8217;er she wound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Turning about to him the victoress cried,<BR>
Laughing, &#8220;This lady I to thee present,<BR>
And the more beauty is in her descried,<BR>
The more that she is thine I am content,<BR>
Now in my place her champion and her guide.<BR>
But do not thou thy plighted faith repent,<BR>
So that thou fail, as promised, to attend<BR>
The dame, wherever she may please to wend.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
Without awaiting answer, to career<BR>
She spurred her horse, and vanished in the wood.<BR>
Zerbino, deeming her a cavalier,<BR>
Cried to the crone, &#8220;By whom am I subdued?&#8221;<BR>
And, knowing &#8217;twould be poison to his ear,<BR>
And that it would inflame his angered blood,<BR>
She in reply, &#8220;It was a damsel&#8217;s blow<BR>
Which from thy lofty saddle laid thee low.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She, for her matchless force, deservedly<BR>
Usurps from cavalier the sword and lance;<BR>
And even from the east is come to try<BR>
Her strength against the paladins of France.&#8221;<BR>
Not only was his cheek of crimson dye,<BR>
Such shame Zerbino felt as his mischance,<BR>
Little was wanting (so his blushes spread)<BR>
But all the arms he wore had glowed as red.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
He mounts, and blames himself in angry wise,<BR>
In that he had no better kept his seat.<BR>
Within herself the beldam laughs, and tries<BR>
The Scottish warrior more to sting and heat.<BR>
To him for promised convoy she applies;<BR>
And he, who knows that there is no retreat,<BR>
Stands like tired courser, who in pensive fit,<BR>
Hangs down his ears, controlled by spur and bit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
And, sighing deeply, cries, in his despair,<BR>
&#8220;Fell Fortune, with what change dost thou repay<BR>
My loss! she who was fairest of the fair,<BR>
Who should be mine, by thee is snatched away!<BR>
And thinkest thou the evil to repair<BR>
With her whom thou hast given to me this day?<BR>
Rather than make like ill exchange, less cross<BR>
It were to undergo a total loss.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her, who for virtue and for beauteous form<BR>
Was never equalled, nor will ever be,<BR>
Thou on the rocks hast wrecked, in wintry storm,<BR>
As food for fowls and fishes of the sea;<BR>
And her who should have fed the earth-bred worm<BR>
Preserved beyond her date, some ten or score<BR>
Of years, to harass and torment me more.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
So spake Zerbino, and like grief displaid,<BR>
In his despairing words and woful mien,<BR>
For such an odious acquisition made,<BR>
As he had suffered when he lost his queen.<BR>
The aged woman now, from what he said,<BR>
Though she before Zerbino had not seen,<BR>
Perceived &#8217;twas him of whom, in the thieves&#8217; hold,<BR>
Isabel of Gallicia erst had told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
If you remember what was said before,<BR>
This was the hag who &#8217;scaped out of the cave,<BR>
Where Isabella, who had wounded sore<BR>
Zerbino&#8217;s heart, was long detained a slave;<BR>
Who oft had told how she her native shore<BR>
Had left, and, launching upon ocean&#8217;s wave<BR>
Her frigate, had been wrecked by wind and swell<BR>
Upon the rocky shallows near Rochelle.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVI.</TD><TD>
And she to her Zerbino&#8217;s goodly cheer<BR>
And gentle features had pourtrayed so well,<BR>
That the hag hearing him, and now more near,<BR>
Letter her eyes upon his visage dwell,<BR>
Discerned it was the youth for whom, whilere,<BR>
Had grieved at heart the prisoned Isabel;<BR>
Whose loss she in the cavern more deplored,<BR>
Than being captive to the murderous horde.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVII.</TD><TD>
The beldam, hearing what in rage and grief<BR>
Zerbino vents, perceives the youth to be<BR>
Deceived, and cheated by the false belief<BR>
That Isabel had perished in the sea;<BR>
And though she might have given the prince relief,<BR>
Knowing the truth, in her perversity<BR>
What would have made him joyful she concealed,<BR>
And only what would cause him grief revealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hear, you that are so proud,&#8221; (the hag pursues)<BR>
&#8220;And flout me with such insolence and scorn,<BR>
You would entreat me fair to have the news<BR>
I know of her whose timeless death you mourn;<BR>
But to be strangled would I rather choose,<BR>
And be into a thousand pieces torn.<BR>
Whereas if you had made me kinder cheer,<BR>
Haply from me the secret might you hear.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIX.</TD><TD>
As the dog&#8217;s rage is quickly overblown,<BR>
Who flies the approaching robber to arrest,<BR>
If the thief proffer piece of bread or bone,<BR>
Of offer other lure which likes him best;<BR>
As readily Zerbino to the crone<BR>
Humbled himself, and burned to know the rest;<BR>
Who, in the hints of the old woman, read<BR>
That she had news of her he mourned as dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXL.</TD><TD>
And with more winning mien to her applied,<BR>
And her did supplicate, entreat, conjure,<BR>
By men and gods, the truth no more to hide,<BR>
Did she benign or evil lot endure.<BR>
The hard and pertinacious crone replied,<BR>
&#8220;Nought shalt thou hear, thy comfort to assure.<BR>
Isabel has not yielded up her breath,<BR>
But lives a life she would exchange for death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She, since thou heardest of her destiny,<BR>
Within few days, has fallen into the power<BR>
Of more than twenty. If restored to thee,<BR>
Think now, if thou hast hope to crop her flower.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Curst hag, how well thou shapest thy history,<BR>
Yet knowest it is false! Her virgin dower<BR>
Secure from brutal wrong, would none invade,<BR>
Though in the power of twenty were the maid.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLII.</TD><TD>
Questioning of the maid, he when and where<BR>
She saw her, vainly asked the beldam hoar,<BR>
Who, ever restive to Zerbino&#8217;s prayer,<BR>
To what she had rehearsed would add no more.<BR>
The prince in the beginning spoke her fair,<BR>
And next to cut her throat in fury swore.<BR>
But prayers and menaces alike were weak;<BR>
Nor could he make the hideous beldam speak.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIII.</TD><TD>
At length Zerbino to his tongue gave rest,<BR>
Since speaking to the woman booted nought;<BR>
Scarcely his heart found room within his breast,<BR>
Such dread suspicion had her story wrought.<BR>
He to find Isabella was so pressed,<BR>
Her in the midst of fire he would have sought;<BR>
But could not hurry more than was allowed<BR>
By her his convoy, since he so had vowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIV.</TD><TD>
They hence, by strange and solitary way,<BR>
Rove, as the beldam does her will betoken,<BR>
Nor climbing, nor descending hill, survey<BR>
Each other&#8217;s face, nor any word is spoken.<BR>
But when the sun upon the middle day<BR>
Had turned his back, their silence first was broken<BR>
By cavalier encountered in their way:<BR>
What followed the ensuing strain will say.</TD></TR>
