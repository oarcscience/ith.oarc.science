<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
To her that does for her Rogero stay,<BR>
Tidings are brought which irk the damsel sore,<BR>
That fair Marphisa caused the youth&#8217;s delay;<BR>
She bent to slay her, grieving evermore,<BR>
Departs, and overtakes, upon the way,<BR>
Ullania with the three kings who rode before.<BR>
These she o&#8217;ercomes, and had o&#8217;ercome that maid,<BR>
But that an evil law she disobeyed.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
I recollect that I was bound to sing<BR>
(I promised so, but it escaped my mind)<BR>
Of a suspicion, fraught with suffering<BR>
To Bradamant of more displeasing kind,<BR>
And made by keener and more venomed sting<BR>
Than caused that other wound, wherewith she pined,<BR>
Which, hearing Richardet his news impart,<BR>
Had pierced her breast and preyed upon her heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
So was I bound to sing, but I begun<BR>
Another song, Rinaldo crossed my way,<BR>
And then those deeds by savage Guido done,<BR>
Kept me employed and caused no small delay;<BR>
And so from subject I to subject run,<BR>
That I forgot of Bradamant to say.<BR>
I now remember, and will tell you, ere<BR>
You of Rinaldo or Gradasso hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
But it behoves, ere more of these be said,<BR>
I should awhile of Agramant discourse,<BR>
Who had from that night&#8217;s raging fire conveyed<BR>
To Arles, the remnant of his scattered force:<BR>
Since to unite his troops, and furnish aid<BR>
And victual, &#8217;twas a place of much resource,<BR>
Seated upon a river, nigh the shore,<BR>
With Spain in front and Africa before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
With horse and foot, of good or evil sort,<BR>
Marsilius throughout Spain their loss repairs;<BR>
And each armed back in Barcellona&#8217;s port,<BR>
Furnished through love or fear, for sea prepares.<BR>
The Moor to council daily calls his court;<BR>
Nor care nor cost the watchful monarch spares:<BR>
Meanwhile sore taxes and repeated cess,<BR>
All Africa&#8217;s o&#8217;erburdened towns oppress.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
He offers Rodomont, if to his side<BR>
He will return, but offers him in vain,<BR>
Renowned Almontes&#8217; daughter, as a bride;<BR>
His cousin she, her portion Oran&#8217;s reign.<BR>
He lures not from his bridge that knight of pride,<BR>
Who has so many sells, such plate and chain<BR>
Collected there, from cavaliers o&#8217;erthrown,<BR>
As serve to hide the monumental stone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Marphisa would not such a course pursue:<BR>
Nay, the redoubted damsel hearing said<BR>
That Agramant, subdued by Charles&#8217;s crew,<BR>
&#8212;His choicest warriors taken, chased, or dead&#8212;<BR>
In Arles was sheltered with his broken few,<BR>
Thither, unbidden by the monarch, sped,<BR>
Prompt to assist him with her friendly blade;<BR>
And proffered purse and person in his aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
As a free gift to him the martial fair<BR>
Brunello bore, nor had she done him wrong.<BR>
He, for ten days and nights, to swing in air,<BR>
Had sorely feared, from lofty gallows hung:<BR>
But seeing him unhelped by force or prayer<BR>
Of any one amid the paynim throng,<BR>
She thought foul scorn to stain her generous hands<BR>
With such base blood, and loosed the losel&#8217;s bands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
She pardoned every ancient injury,<BR>
And him to Agramant in Arles conveyed.<BR>
Well may you fancy with what joy and glee<BR>
The monarch greeted her who brought him aid;<BR>
He in Brunello&#8217;s fate wills all shall see<BR>
In what esteem he holds that warlike maid;<BR>
For he in earnest does upon her foe<BR>
What fierce Marphisa menaced but in show.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
The hangman hung his corpse in desert field,<BR>
The craving vulture and the crow to feed.<BR>
Rogero, that erewhile had been his shield,<BR>
And from the noose that caitiff would have freed,<BR>
Heaven&#8217;s justice willed, now lay with wound unhealed,<BR>
Nor could assist the craven in his need;<BR>
And when the news were known, the knot was tied;<BR>
So that Brunello, unassisted, died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
This while does good duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter mourn,<BR>
Because those twenty days so slowly trail:<BR>
&#8212;Which term elapsed&#8212;Rogero should return,<BR>
And be received into her church&#8217;s pale.<BR>
Time halts not more with him to foreign bourne<BR>
Exiled, with prisoner pent in noisome jail,<BR>
Pines the poor wretch for liberty and light,<BR>
Or his loved land, desired and gladsome sight!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Aye sick with hope deferred, the expecting maid,<BR>
That Ph&#339;bus&#8217; steeds were foundered one while deemed;<BR>
Then that his wheels were out of frame, so stayed,<BR>
Beyond the wonted term, his chariot seemed.<BR>
Yet longer than that day when Faith delayed<BR>
The sun, which on the righteous Hebrew beamed,<BR>
Or than that night Alcides was conceived,<BR>
She every day and every night believed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
How oft of dormouse, badger, or of bear,<BR>
The heavy slumber would she fain partake!<BR>
For she that time in sleep would waste and wear;<BR>
Nor such prolonged repose desired to break;<BR>
Nor wished the damsel any sound to hear,<BR>
Until Rogero&#8217;s voice should her awake:<BR>
But not alone is this beyond her power;<BR>
She cannot close her eyes one single hour.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
She here and there, throughout the livelong night,<BR>
Tosses and turns, nor ever finds repose;<BR>
And still, impatient for the dawn of light,<BR>
From time to time she to her window goes,<BR>
To see if Tithon&#8217;s spouse the lily white<BR>
Yet scatters mingled with the crimson rose.<BR>
Nor less desires the damsel, when &#8217;tis morn,<BR>
To see the golden stars the heaven adorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
When, saving some four days, the term was ended,<BR>
Appointed for the youthful warrior&#8217;s stay,<BR>
She, full of hope, the messenger attended<BR>
From hour to hour, that should arrive, and say,<BR>
&#8220;Behold Rogero comes&#8221;; and oft ascended<BR>
A turret, from whose top she might survey<BR>
Gay champaign, wood, and, mid the wide expanse,<BR>
A portion of the road, that led to France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
When shining arms at distance she perceives,<BR>
Or any thing that speaks a cavalier,<BR>
&#8217;Tis her desired Rogero, she believes;<BR>
And her fair eyes and brows are seen to clear.<BR>
If footman, or unarmed, the maid conceives,<BR>
It is a courier from the youthful peer;<BR>
And, though fallacious every hope she feeds,<BR>
Another and another aye succeeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
And then she arms, and will the warrior meet;<BR>
And from the hill descends into the plain:<BR>
She finds him not, and to Montalban&#8217;s seat<BR>
Hopes he by other road his way has ta&#8217;en.<BR>
In the design, wherewith she moved her feet<BR>
From thence, she to her fort returns in vain;<BR>
Nor finds him here nor there; meanwhile expired<BR>
The period whose approach she so desired.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8212;The period so prefixt o&#8217;erpast by one,<BR>
By two, three, six, by eight, by twenty days&#8212;<BR>
She seeing not her spouse, and tidings none<BR>
Receiving of the youth, laments &#8217;gan raise,<BR>
Which had from snake-haired Furies pity won,<BR>
In those dark realms that Rhadamanthus sways.<BR>
She smote her eyes divine, and bosoms fair;<BR>
She rent the tresses of her golden hair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Can it be true?&#8221;&#8212;(she cried)&#8212;&#8220;Shall I be fain<BR>
To follow one, that strives to hide and fly?<BR>
Esteem a man that has me in disdain?<BR>
Pray him that never hears my suppliant cry?<BR>
Suffer who hates me o&#8217;er my heart to reign?<BR>
One that his lofty virtues holds so high,<BR>
&#8217;Twere need some heaven-born goddess should descend<BR>
From realms above, his stubborn heart to bend?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Proud youth! he knows my worship and my love,<BR>
Nor me will have for lover or for slave.<BR>
The cruel stripling knows what pangs I prove,<BR>
Yet will not aid me till I am in my grave.<BR>
Nor let me tell my sorrows, lest they move<BR>
Him his perverse and evil will to wave;<BR>
Shunning me like malignant asp, that fears<BR>
To change his mood, if he the charmer hears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! Love, arrest this wight who runs so free,<BR>
Outstripping my slow feet, or me install<BR>
In the condition whence thou tookest me,<BR>
Such as I was, ere thine or other&#8217;s thrall.<BR>
&#8212;Alas! how vain the hope! that thou shouldst be<BR>
Ever to pity moved by suppliant call,<BR>
Who sport, yea feed and live, in streams that rise<BR>
From the distracted lover&#8217;s brimming eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But, woe is me, alas! and, what can I<BR>
Save my irrational desire lament?<BR>
Which makes me soar a pitch so passing high,<BR>
I reach a region, where my plumes are brent;<BR>
Then, unsustained, fall headlong from the sky;<BR>
Nor ends my woe; on other flight intent,<BR>
Again I imp my wings, again I soar;<BR>
To flame and fall, tormented evermore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yea; rather of myself should I complain,<BR>
Than the desire, to which I bared my breast<BR>
Whereby was Reason hunted from her reign,<BR>
And all my powers by stronger force opprest.<BR>
Thus borne from bad to worse, without a rein,<BR>
I cannot the unbridled beast arrest;<BR>
Who makes me see I to destruction haste,<BR>
That I more bitterness in death may taste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet, ah! why blame myself? Wherein have I<BR>
Ever offended, save in loving thee?<BR>
What wonder was it then that suddenly<BR>
A woman&#8217;s feeble sense opprest should be?<BR>
Why fence and guard myself, lest bearing high,<BR>
Wise words, and beauty rare should pleasure me?<BR>
Most wretched is the mortal that would shun<BR>
To look upon the visage of the sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides that me my destiny entrained,<BR>
Words, worthy credence, moved me much, that drew<BR>
A picture of rare happiness, ordained<BR>
As meed of this fair unless to ensue.<BR>
If these persuasive words were false and feigned,<BR>
If famous Merlin&#8217;s counsel was untrue,<BR>
Wrath at the wizard may I well profess;<BR>
But cannot therefore love Rogero less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Both Merlin and Melissa have I need<BR>
To blame, and shall for ever blame the twain,<BR>
That, to exhibit suckers of my seed,<BR>
Conjured up spirits from infernal reign,<BR>
Who with this empty hope my fancy feed,<BR>
Me in perpetual bondage to detain.<BR>
Nor other cause for this can I suppose,<BR>
Save that they grudge me safe and sweet repose.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Sorrow the maid so wholly occupies,<BR>
Room has she none for comfort or for rest.<BR>
Yet, maugre her affliction, Hope will rise,<BR>
And form a lodgement in her harassed breast;<BR>
And to the damsel&#8217;s memory still supplies<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s parting words to her addrest;<BR>
So makes her, in all seeming facts&#8217; despite,<BR>
Await from hour to hour the youthful knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
For a month&#8217;s space beyond those twenty days<BR>
This hope affords fair Bradamant content:<BR>
Hence sorrow not on her so heavy weighs<BR>
As it would else her harassed soul have shent.<BR>
She, one day that along the road she strays,<BR>
By which she oft to meet Rogero went,<BR>
Hears tidings, that of Hope&#8212;last comfort left&#8212;<BR>
(Like every other good) her breast bereft.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Bound homeward from the hostile camp, where lay<BR>
King Agramant, she met a Gascon knight,<BR>
A prisoner to those paynims, from the day,<BR>
That fought nigh Paris was the famous fight.<BR>
The damsel prest him all he knew to say:<BR>
Then to the point she covets led the knight:<BR>
Asks of Rogero, on that theme abides,<BR>
Listens to that, not aught inquires besides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Of him a full account did he afford,<BR>
As well acquainted with the court; he said<BR>
How, matched with Mandricardo, strove that lord,<BR>
And layed the martial king in combat dead.<BR>
And how, sore wounded by the Tartar&#8217;s sword,<BR>
Above a month the stripling kept his bed:<BR>
And had the stranger here but closed his news,<BR>
Well might his tale the missing knight excuse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
But then subjoins the Gascon cavalier<BR>
How in the Moorish camp a damsel lies,<BR>
By name Marphisa hight, of beauteous cheer,<BR>
Bold and as skilled in arms of every guise,<BR>
Who loves Rogero and to him is dear;<BR>
And then the host so rarely sundered spies,<BR>
That every one, throughout the paynim train,<BR>
Deems that betrothed in wedlock are the twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
And hope, when healed shall be the youthful knight,<BR>
The marriage of those lovers will succeed;<BR>
(For sure) with pleasure and sincere delight,<BR>
Those tidings paynim prince and monarch read:<BR>
Since, knowing either&#8217;s superhuman might,<BR>
They augur, from their loins will spring a breed,<BR>
In little season, which shall pass in worth<BR>
The mightiest race that ever was on earth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
What he rehearsed, the Gascon knight believed,<BR>
Nor without cause believed the news he bore,<BR>
A rumour universally received<BR>
And bruited through the squadrons of the Moor;<BR>
Who had that notion of their love conceived<BR>
From signs of kindness witnessed evermore.<BR>
For&#8212;good or bad&#8212;though from one mouth it flows,<BR>
Fame to a boundless torrent quickly grows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
That she with him had brought the Paynim aid,<BR>
And ne&#8217;er was seen without the cavalier,<BR>
The first foundation of the rumour layed:<BR>
But what confirmed that fame in every ear,<BR>
Was, that she, having from the camp conveyed<BR>
The thief Brunello (as I sang whilere)<BR>
As if alone to see Rogero brought,<BR>
Had to the camp returned, uncalled, unsought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
She solely to the camp had ta&#8217;en her way,<BR>
To visit him that on a sick-bed smarted;<BR>
Nor once alone; but often all the day<BR>
There passed that maid, and but at eve departed:<BR>
Who gave yet greater cause of her to say,<BR>
That&#8212;known as one so haughty and hard-hearted,<BR>
Who all the world despised&#8212;she now was grown<BR>
Benign and humble to the Child alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
When Bradamant the Gascon&#8217;s story heard,<BR>
That lady suffered such tormenting pain,<BR>
Such cruel woe her inmost bosom stirred,<BR>
From falling she preserved herself with pain.<BR>
She turned her courser round, without a word,<BR>
Inflamed with jealousy and fierce disdain:<BR>
From her all hope the wretched damsel spurns,<BR>
And to her chamber breathing wrath returns.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Turned on her face, her body on the bed,<BR>
Armed as she is, th4e grieving damsel throws,<BR>
And that the sad lament by sorrow bred,<BR>
May be unheard of any, bites the clothes;<BR>
And so, repeating what the stranger said,<BR>
To such a pitcher her smothered anguish grows,<BR>
Her plaints no longer able to restrain,<BR>
So vents the maid parforce her piteous pain:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Who ever can be trusted? woe is me!<BR>
All false and cruel well may be esteemed,<BR>
If thou, Rogero, false and cruel be,<BR>
That I so pious and so faithful deemed.<BR>
What foul and felon act, what treachery,<BR>
Was ever yet by tragic poet dreamed,<BR>
But will fall short of thine, if thou wilt set<BR>
The sum of my desert, against thy debts?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Wherefore, Rogero, since no cavalier<BR>
Mates thee in beauteous form and daring feat,<BR>
Since thou in matchless valour hast no peer,<BR>
And none with thee in gentleness compete,<BR>
Why cannot we, &#8217;mid godlike gifts and clear,<BR>
Allow thee truth, thy graces to complete?<BR>
The praise of spotless truth to thee allow,<BR>
To which all other virtues yield and bow?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Knowest thou not, without it, worthless are<BR>
All gentle bearing and all martial might?<BR>
As there is nothing, howsoever fair,<BR>
That can be seen without the aid of light.<BR>
Easily mightest thou a maid ensnare,<BR>
Lord as thou was, and idol in her sight.<BR>
Her with thy honied words thou might&#8217;st have won,<BR>
To deem that cold and darksome was the sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Cruel, what sin can trouble thee, if thou<BR>
Do&#8217;st not her murder who loved thee repent?<BR>
If held so lightly be a breach of vow&#8212;<BR>
Beneath what burden will thy heart be bent?<BR>
What treatment will thine adversary know,<BR>
If one who loves like me thou so torment?<BR>
Justice is none in heaven, I well may say,<BR>
If Heaven its vengeance for my wrongs delay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If of all human sins of deepest dye<BR>
Be fell ingratitude; if doomed to smart<BR>
For this, the fairest angel of the sky<BR>
Was banished into foul and darksome part;<BR>
If mighty sins for mighty vengeance cry,<BR>
Where due atonement cleanses not the heart;<BR>
Beware lest thou beneath such vengeance groan,<BR>
Ingrate! that wouldest not thy sin atone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Cruel Rogero, I of theft, beside<BR>
All other sins, may justly thee arraign.<BR>
That thou my heart has ravished form my side,<BR>
&#8212;Of this offence I will not, I complain&#8212;<BR>
But, having made it mine, that thou defied<BR>
All right, and took away thy gift again.<BR>
Restore it; well thou know&#8217;st what pains requite<BR>
His sin, who keeps what is another&#8217;s right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou hast left me, Rogero; thee to leave,<BR>
Alas! I neither will nor power possess.<BR>
But will and power have I my life to reave,<BR>
To scape from this o&#8217;erwhelming wretchedness.<BR>
To die at strife with thee alone I grieve:<BR>
For, had the gods so pleased my lot to bless,<BR>
As to require my life, when loved of thee,<BR>
Never so welcome had been death to me.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Resolved to die, &#8217;twas so the damsel cried;<BR>
And starting from her bed, by passion warmed,<BR>
To her left breast her naked sword applied;<BR>
Then recollected she was wholly armed.<BR>
Meanwhile her better Spirit, at her side,<BR>
With these persuasive words her fury charmed:<BR>
&#8220;O lady, born to such illustrious name!<BR>
Would&#8217;st thou conclude thy life with such foul shame?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Were it not better to the field to go,<BR>
Where aye thy breath with glory may be spent?<BR>
There, should Rogero chance to lay thee low,<BR>
He to have slain thee haply may repent;<BR>
But, should his faulchion deal the mortal blow,<BR>
What death could ever yield thee more content?<BR>
Reason it were thou should&#8217;st by him be slain,<BR>
Who dooms thee living to such passing pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Haply of that Marphisa, too, before<BR>
Thou die, thou yet may deadly vengeance take,<BR>
Who with dishonest love and treacherous lore<BR>
Did thy beloved Rogero&#8217;s fealty shake.&#8221;<BR>
This seemed to please the mournful lady more<BR>
Than her first thought; and she forthwith bade make<BR>
A mantle for her arms, which should imply<BR>
Her desperation and desire to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
The vest is of that colour which is spied<BR>
In leaf, when gray and yellow are at strife;<BR>
When it is gathered from the branch, or dried<BR>
Is the green blood, that was it&#8217;s parent&#8217;s life.<BR>
Embroidered is the surcoat&#8217;s outer side<BR>
With stems of cypress which disdain the knife;<BR>
Which shoot not, when by biting steel laid low.<BR>
A habit well according with her woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
She took the courser that was wont to bear<BR>
Astolpho, and with him the lance of gold,<BR>
By whose sole touch unhorsed all champions were.<BR>
Needless anew I deem it to unfold<BR>
Why by Astolpho given, and when and where,<BR>
Or how that spear obtained the warrior bold.<BR>
The lady took the lance, but nothing guessed<BR>
Of the stupendous virtue it possessed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Without attendants, without squire, alone,<BR>
The hill descending by the nearest way,<BR>
Toward Paris is the mournful damsel gone,<BR>
Where camped erewhile the Moorish forces lay;<BR>
For yet to her the tidings were unknown,<BR>
That good Rinaldo and his bold array<BR>
Had raised, with Charles&#8217; and Malagigi&#8217;s aid,<BR>
The siege the paynims had to Paris laid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8212;Cadurci, and Cahors city left behind&#8212;<BR>
Bradamant sees the mountain, far and near,<BR>
Whence Dordogne&#8217;s waters to the valley wind;<BR>
And Montferrant&#8217;s and Clermont&#8217;s towers appear:<BR>
When she, a lady fair, of semblance kind,<BR>
Beholds, by that same road, towards her steer.<BR>
Three knights were nigh, and&#8212;at the pommel hung&#8212;<BR>
A buckler from the damsel&#8217;s saddle swung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Before the lady and behind her ride<BR>
More squires and maids, a numerous company.<BR>
Fair Bradamant of one that past beside<BR>
Demanded who the stranger dame might be?<BR>
&#8220;That lady to the king of France&#8221; (replied<BR>
The squire) &#8220;is sent upon an embassy<BR>
From THE LOST ISLE, which lies mid seas that roll<BR>
Their restless waves beyond the northern pole.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Some THE LOST ISLE, some Iceland call the reign<BR>
Whereof a royal lady fills the throne;<BR>
Whose charms (before those charms all beauties wane)<BR>
Are such as Heaven had dealt to her alone.<BR>
The shield you see she sends to Charlemagne,<BR>
But with the pact and purpose plainly shown,<BR>
He should confer it on the knight, whose worth<BR>
Is, in his judgment, fairest upon earth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She, as she deems herself (and it is true<BR>
She is the fairest of all womankind),<BR>
A cavalier, that should in heart and thew<BR>
Surpass all other warriors, fain would find;<BR>
Resolved, should her a hundred thousand woo,<BR>
None shall unfix the purpose of her mind;<BR>
&#8212;But he, held worthiest by the world&#8217;s accord,<BR>
Alone shall be her lover and her lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In France, in royal Charles&#8217;s famous court,<BR>
The damsel hopes to find the cavalier,<BR>
Who in a thousand feats of high report<BR>
Has shown that he excels each puissant peer.<BR>
All three are monarchy who the dame escort,<BR>
And what their kingdoms ye as well shall hear.<BR>
One Sweden rules, one Gothland, Norway one;<BR>
Surpast in martial praise by few or none.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;These three, whose kingdoms at some distance lie,<BR>
Yet the least distant lie from the LOST ISLE,<BR>
(Because few mariners its shore descry,<BR>
As little known, that island so they style),<BR>
Wooed and yet woo her for a wife, and vie<BR>
In valour, and, to win the lady&#8217;s smile,<BR>
Illustrious deeds have done, which Fame shall sound,<BR>
While Heaven shall circle in its wonted round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet she not these will wed, nor cavalier<BR>
That does not, as she deems, all else excell.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;Lightly I hold your proof of valour here,&#8217;<BR>
(Those northern monarchs was she wont to tell)<BR>
&#8216;And if, like sun amid the stars, one peer<BR>
Outshines his fellows, him I honour well:<BR>
But therefore hold him not, in fierce alarms,<BR>
Of living men the bravest knight at arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;To Charlemagne, whom I esteem and hold<BR>
As wisest among reigning kings, by me<BR>
Shall be dispatched a costly shield of gold,<BR>
On pact and on condition, that it be<BR>
Bestowed on him, deemed boldest of the bold,<BR>
Amid the martial ranks of chivalry.<BR>
Serves the king Charlemagne or other lord,<BR>
I will be governed by that king&#8217;s award.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;If when King Charles the buckler shall receive<BR>
And give to one so stout, that best among<BR>
All others he that warrior shall believe,<BR>
Do they to his or other court belong.<BR>
For me the golden buckler shall retrieve<BR>
One of you three, in his own virtue strong;<BR>
My every love and thought shall he possess;<BR>
Him for my spouse and lord will I confess.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Moved by these stirring speeches, hither hie<BR>
From that wide-distant sea, those monarchs bold,<BR>
Resolved to win the buckler, or to die<BR>
Beneath his hand who has that shield of gold.&#8221;<BR>
Bradamant ponders much the squire&#8217;s reply:<BR>
He give his horse the head&#8212;his story told&#8212;<BR>
And plies him so with restless heel and hand,<BR>
He overtakes the damsel&#8217;s distant band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
After him gallops not, nor hurries ought,<BR>
Bradamant, who pursues her road at ease:<BR>
Much evermore evolving in her thought<BR>
Things that may chance, she finally foresees<BR>
That through the buckler by that damsel brought,<BR>
Will follow strife and boundless enmities,<BR>
Amid king Charles&#8217;s peerage and the rest,<BR>
If with that shield he shall reward the best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
This grieved the damsel&#8217;s heart, but far above<BR>
That grief, the former fear her heard did goad;<BR>
That young Rogero had withdrawn his love<BR>
From her, and on the warlike queen bestowed.<BR>
So buried in the thoughts wherewith she strove,<BR>
Was Bradamant, she heeded nor her road,<BR>
Nor took she care where, at the close of light,<BR>
To find befitting shelter for the night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
As when from squall, or other chance, a barge<BR>
Drives from the river-side, where late it lay,<BR>
Under no mariner or pilot&#8217;s charge,<BR>
The winds and waves at will transport their prey;<BR>
So Rabican with Bradamant, at large,<BR>
&#8212;She musing on Rogero&#8212;wends his way.<BR>
For thence, by many miles, was distant wide<BR>
That mind which should her courser&#8217;s bridle guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
She raised her eyes at last, and saw the sun<BR>
Had turned his back on Bocchus&#8217; towers and wall;<BR>
Then, like a cormorant, his journey done,<BR>
Into his nurse&#8217;s lap beheld him fall,<BR>
Beyond Marocco; and for her to run<BR>
To tree, for shelter from the rising squall,<BR>
Had been a foolish thought; for now &#8217;gan blow<BR>
A blustering wind, which threatened rain or snow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
To better speed fair Bradamant aroused<BR>
Her courser, yet but little way did ride,<BR>
When with his flock, which on the champaign browsed,<BR>
Leaving the fields, a shepherd she espied.<BR>
To him where, well or ill, she might be housed,<BR>
&#8212;With many instances the maid applied&#8212;<BR>
For never house could such ill shelter yield,<BR>
But that in rain &#8217;twere worse to lodge afield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
To her the shepherd said, &#8220;I know of none<BR>
Whereto I could direct you, near at hand.<BR>
At least six leagues are distant all, but one,<BR>
Named TRISTRAM&#8217;S TOWER, throughout the neighbouring land.<BR>
But not to all men is the door undone;<BR>
For it behoves that they, with lance in hand,<BR>
Achieve their footing first and the defend,<BR>
Who to be lodged within its walls pretend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If there be room within, to stranger knight<BR>
The castellain gives kindly welcome there:<BR>
But is a lodging claimed by other wight,<BR>
To joust with all new comers makes him swear:<BR>
If none, he need not move; but arms and fight<BR>
He must what stranger thither shall repair;<BR>
And he that worst his warlike arms shall ply,<BR>
Must wander forth beneath the naked sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If two. three, four, or more, seek shelter, they<BR>
That first arrive, in peace their quarters take.<BR>
Who follows, has a harder game to play;<BR>
For war upon those many must he make.<BR>
So, if one only in that mansion stay,<BR>
He with those two, or more, a lance must break.<BR>
Then with as many others as succeed:<BR>
Thus he what strength he has shall sorely need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As well, if wife or maid seek that repair,<BR>
(Is she alone, is she accompanied),<BR>
And afterwards another, the most fair<BR>
Is housed; that other must without abide.&#8221;<BR>
Bradamant asked the kindly shepherd where<BR>
That castle stood; and he with signs replied<BR>
As well as words, and pointed with his hand<BR>
Where, five or six miles wide, the tower did stand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Though Rabican&#8217;s good paces merit praise,<BR>
To hurry him the damsel had no skill,<BR>
By those so passing foul and broken ways,<BR>
(By season somewhat rainy rendered ill)<BR>
So, as to reach the tower, ere Night o&#8217;erlays<BR>
The world, whose every nook dark shadows fill.<BR>
Arrived, that lady finds the portal barred,<BR>
And that she seeks a lodging tells the guard.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
He answers that the place is occupied<BR>
By dame and knight already housed, who, met<BR>
About the fire, in that chill evening-tide,<BR>
Wait till their supper be before them set.<BR>
To him that maid: &#8220;The board is not supplied,<BR>
I deem, for them, unless the meal be eat.<BR>
Now, say I wait their coming.&#8221; (she pursues,)<BR>
Who know and will observe your castle&#8217;s use.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
The guard his message bore, where at their ease<BR>
Reposed the weary cavaliers; his tale<BR>
Not overlikely was those kings to please;<BR>
For cold and peevish blew the wintry gale,<BR>
And now fast fell the rain; yet, forced to seize<BR>
Their arms, they slowly don the martial mail.<BR>
The rest remain within; while they proceed<BR>
Against the damsel, but with little speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Three cavaliers they were, of might so tried,<BR>
Few champions but to them in prowess yield,<BR>
The same that she that very day, beside<BR>
The courier maid, encountered in the field,<BR>
They that in Iceland boasted, in their pride,<BR>
To bear away from France the golden shield:<BR>
Who (for they had the martial maid outrode)<BR>
Arrived before her at that lord&#8217;s abode.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
In feats of arms few warriors were more stout;<BR>
But she besure will be among those few,<BR>
She, that on no account will wait without,<BR>
Fasting and wet, night&#8217;s weary watches through.<BR>
Within from window and from lodge, the rout<BR>
Look forth, and will the joust by moonlight view,<BR>
Which streams from underneath a covering cloud;<BR>
Albeit the furious rain beats fast and loud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Such transport as the longing gallant cheers,<BR>
About to seize the stolen fruits of love,<BR>
When, after long delay, the listener hears<BR>
The bold within its socket softly move,<BR>
Such transport cheered her, of those cavaliers<BR>
The prowess and the pith a-fire to prove,<BR>
When now the opened portals she descried,<BR>
And drawbridge dropt, and issuing knights espied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
When she beheld, how, of the drawbridge clear<BR>
Those knights, together or scarce sundered, came,<BR>
She took her ground; and next in fierce career,<BR>
With flowing bridle, drove the furious dame,<BR>
Levelling against those kings that virtuous spear,<BR>
Her cousin&#8217;s gift, which never missed its aim;<BR>
Whose touch each warrior must unseat parforce;<BR>
Yea Mars, should Mars contend in mortal course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
The king of Sweden, foremost of those knights,<BR>
In falling too is foremost of the train;<BR>
With such surpassing force his helmet smites<BR>
That spear, which never yet was couched in vain.<BR>
Gothland&#8217;s good king next meets the maid, and lights<BR>
With feet in air, at distance on the plain.<BR>
The third (unhorsed by Aymon&#8217;s beauteous daughter)<BR>
Half buried lies in mire and marshy water.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
When at three strokes she had unhorsed them all,<BR>
Lighting with head on earth and heels in air,<BR>
Retiring from the field, she sought the Hall,<BR>
In search of lodging; but, ere harboured there,<BR>
To issue forth, at whosoever&#8217;s call,<BR>
Is, by the warder&#8217;s hest, obliged to swear.<BR>
That lord who well had weighed her famous feats,<BR>
The damsel with surpassing honour greets.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
So does by her the lady, that erewhile<BR>
Had thither journeyed, with those monarchs three,<BR>
As I related, sent from the LOST ISLE<BR>
To France&#8217;s king, upon an embassy.<BR>
Kind as she is and affable of style,<BR>
She renders back the stranger&#8217;s courtesy;<BR>
Rises to welcome her with smiling air,<BR>
And to the fire conducts that warlike fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
As Bradamant unarms, and first her shield,<BR>
And after puts her polished casque away,<BR>
A caul of shining gold, wherein concealed<BR>
And clustering close, her prisoned tresses lay,<BR>
She with the helmet doffs; and now revealed,<BR>
(While the long locks about her shoulders play,)<BR>
A lovely damsel by that band is seen,<BR>
No fiercer in affray than fair of mien.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
As when the stage&#8217;s curtain is uprolled,<BR>
Mid thousand lamps, appears the mimic scene,<BR>
Adorned with arch and palace, pictures, gold,<BR>
And statues; or, as limpid and serene<BR>
The sun his visage, glorious to behold,<BR>
Unveils, emerging from a cloudy screen;<BR>
So when the lady doffs her iron case,<BR>
All paradise seems opened in her face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Already so well-grown and widely spread<BR>
Were the bright tresses which the hermit shore,<BR>
These, gathered in a knot, behind her head,<BR>
Though shorter than their wont, the damsel wore;<BR>
And he, that castle&#8217;s master, plainly read,<BR>
(Who often had beheld her face before)<BR>
That this was Bradamant; and now he paid<BR>
Yet higher honours to the martial maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
With modest and with mirthful talk this while,<BR>
Seated about the fire, they feed the ear;<BR>
And in this way the weary time beguile<BR>
Till they are heartened with more solid cheer.<BR>
If new or ancient were his castle&#8217;s style,<BR>
(Bradamant asks the courteous cavalier)<BR>
By whom begun, and how it took its rise?<BR>
And thus that castellain to her replies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When Pharamond of France possessed the throne,<BR>
His son, prince Clodion, had a mistress rare;<BR>
And damsel in that ancient age was none<BR>
More graceful, beauteous, or more debonair;<BR>
So loved of Pharamond&#8217;s enamoured son,<BR>
That he lost sight no oftener of the fair<BR>
Than Io&#8217;s shepherd of his charge whilere:<BR>
For jealous as enamoured was the peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her in this mansion, which his sire bestowed,<BR>
He kept, and rarely issued from his rest:<BR>
With him were lodged ten cavaliers, allowed<BR>
Through France to be the boldest and the best.<BR>
Hither, while in this castle he abode,<BR>
Sir Tristram and a dame their course addrest:<BR>
Whom from a furious giant, in her need,<BR>
Short time before that gentle knight had freed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sir Tristram and his lady reached the Hall,<BR>
When now the sun had Seville left behind.<BR>
They for admission on the porter call,<BR>
Since they for ten miles round no shelter find,<BR>
But Clodion, that loved much, and was withal<BR>
Sore jealous, was determined in his mind<BR>
No stranger in his keep should ever inn,<BR>
So long as that fair lady lodged therein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When, after long entreaties made in vain,<BR>
The castellain refused to house the knight,<BR>
He said, &#8216;What supplication cannot gain,<BR>
I hope to make thee do in they despite&#8217;;<BR>
And loudly challenged him, with all his train,<BR>
Those ten which he maintained, to bloody fight;<BR>
Offering, with levelled lance and lifted glaive,<BR>
To prove Sir Clodion a discourteous knave;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;On pact, if he sate fast, and overthrown<BR>
Should be the warder, and his warlike rout,<BR>
He in that castle should be lodged alone,<BR>
And Clodion with his knights remain without.<BR>
Against him goes the king of France&#8217;s son,<BR>
At risque of death, to venge that galling flout;<BR>
But falls astound; the rest partake his fate,<BR>
And on the losers Tristram bars the gate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Entering the tower, he finds her harboured there<BR>
Whereof I spake, so dear in Clodion&#8217;s eyes;<BR>
Whom SHE had equalled with the loveliest fair,<BR>
Nature, so niggard of such courtesies.<BR>
With her Sir Tristram talks, while fell despair<BR>
Aye racks the houseless prince in horrid wise.<BR>
Who prays the conquering knight, with suppliant cry,<BR>
Not to his arms the damsel to deny.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though she small worth in Tristram&#8217;s sight possess,<BR>
Nor any, saving Yseult, please his sight,<BR>
Nor other dame to love or to caress,<BR>
The philtre, drunk erewhile, allows the knight;<BR>
Yet, for he would that foul discourteousness<BR>
Of Clodion with a fit revenge requite,<BR>
He cries, &#8216;I deem it were foul wrong and sore,<BR>
If so such beauty I should shut the door.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And, should Sir Clodion grieve beneath the tree<BR>
To lodge alone, and company demand;<BR>
Although less beautiful, I have with me<BR>
A fair and youthful damsel, here at hand,<BR>
Who, I am well content, his mate shall be,<BR>
And do in all things, as he shall command.<BR>
But she that is most fair to the most strong,<BR>
Meseemeth, in all justice should belong.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Shut out all night, the moody Clodion strayed,<BR>
Puffing and pacing round his lofty tower,<BR>
As if that prince the sentinel had played<BR>
On them, that slept at ease in lordly bower:<BR>
Him, sorer far than wind and cold dismayed<BR>
That lovely lady&#8217;s loss in Tristram&#8217;s power:<BR>
But he, with pity touched, upon the morrow,<BR>
Rendered her back, and so relieved his sorrow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Because, he said, and made it plain appear,<BR>
Such as he found her, he returned the fair;<BR>
And though for his discourtesy whilere,<BR>
Clodion had every scorn deserved to bear,<BR>
He was content with having made the peer<BR>
Outwatch the weary night in open air.<BR>
Accepting not that cavalier&#8217;s excuse,<BR>
Who would have thrown on Love his castle&#8217;s use.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For Love should make a churlish nature kind,<BR>
And not transform to rude a gentle breast.<BR>
When Tristram hence was gone, not long behind<BR>
Remained the enamoured prince who changed his rest:<BR>
But first he to a cavalier consigned<BR>
The tower; whereof that baron he possest,<BR>
On pact, that he and his in the domain<BR>
Henceforth this usage ever should maintain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That cavalier of greater heart and power<BR>
Should in this hall be harboured without fail:<BR>
They that less worthy were should void the tower,<BR>
And seek another inn, by hill or dale.<BR>
In fine, that law was fixt, which to this hour<BR>
Endures, as you have seen&#8221;; while so his tale<BR>
To Bradamant recounts that castle&#8217;s lord,<BR>
The sewer with savoury meats has heaped the board.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
In the great hall that plenteous board was laid,<BR>
(None fairer was in all the world beside)<BR>
Then came where those beauteous ladies stayed,<BR>
And them, with torches lit, did thither guide.<BR>
On entering, Bradamant the room surveyed,<BR>
And she, that other fair, on every side;<BR>
Who as they gaze about the gorgeous hall<BR>
Filled full of picture, mark each storied wall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
So beauteous are the figures, that instead<BR>
Of eating, on the painted walls they stare;<BR>
Albeit of meat they have no little need,<BR>
Who wearied sore with that day&#8217;s labour are.<BR>
With grief the sewer, with grief the cook takes heed,<BR>
How on the table cools the untasted fare.<BR>
Nay, there is one amid the crowd, who cries,<BR>
&#8220;First fill your bellies, and then feast your eyes.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
The guests were placed, and now about to eat,<BR>
When suddenly bethought that castellain,<BR>
To house two damsels were a thing unmeet;<BR>
One lady must dislodge, and one remain;<BR>
The fairest stay, and she least fair retreat.<BR>
Where howls the wind, where beats the pattering rain.<BR>
Because they separate came, &#8217;tis ordered so:<BR>
One lady must remain, one lady go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
The lord some matrons of his household crew<BR>
Calls, with two elders, in such judgments wise;<BR>
He marks the dames, and bids them of the two<BR>
Declare which is most beauteous in their eyes;<BR>
And all, upon examination due,<BR>
Cry, Aymon&#8217;s daughter best deserves the prize,<BR>
And vouch as she in might those kings outweighed,<BR>
No less in beauty she surpassed the maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
The warder cries to that Islandic dame,<BR>
Who of her sentence has a shrewd suspicion,<BR>
&#8220;O lady, let it be no cause of blame,<BR>
That we observe our usage and condition;<BR>
To seek some other rest must be thine aim,<BR>
Since, by our universal band&#8217;s admission,<BR>
Though unadorned that martial maid be seen,<BR>
Thou canst not match her charms and lovely mien.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
As in a moment&#8217;s time a cloud obscure<BR>
Steams from the bottom of some marshy dale,<BR>
Which the sun&#8217;s visage, late so bright and pure,<BR>
Mantles all over with its dingy veil;<BR>
So that poor damsel, sentenced to endure,<BR>
Without, the pelting shower and blustering gale,<BR>
Is seen to change her cheer, and is no more<BR>
The fair and mirthful maid she was before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
The maid turns pale, and all her colour flies,<BR>
Who dreads so stern a sentence to obey:<BR>
But generous Bradamant, in prudent guise,<BR>
Who could not bear to see her turned away,<BR>
Cried to that baron, &#8220;Partial and unwise<BR>
Your judgment seems, as well all judgments may,<BR>
Wherein the losing party has not room<BR>
To plead before the judge pronounces doom.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I, who this cause take on me to defend,<BR>
Say (whether fairer or less fair I be)<BR>
I came not as a woman, nor intend<BR>
That now mine actions shall be womanly.<BR>
But, saving I undress, who shall pretend<BR>
To say I am or am not such as she?<BR>
Neither should aught be said but what we know,<BR>
And least of all what works another woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Many, as well as I, long tresses wear,<BR>
Yet are not therefore women; if, as guest,<BR>
I have admittance gained to your repair,<BR>
Like woman or like man, is manifest:<BR>
Then why should I the name of woman bear,<BR>
That in my actions stand a man confest?<BR>
&#8217;Tis ruled that woman should a woman chase;<BR>
Nor that a knight a woman should displace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Grant we (what I confess not howsoe&#8217;er)<BR>
That you the woman in my visage read;<BR>
But that in beauty I am not her peer:<BR>
Not therefore, deem I, of my valour&#8217;s meed<BR>
Ye would deprive me, though in beauteous cheer<BR>
The palm I to that damsel should concede<BR>
&#8217;Twere hard, before I yield to her in charms,<BR>
That I should forfeit what I won in arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if it be your usage, that the dame<BR>
Who yields in beauty, from your tower must wend,<BR>
Here to remain I my design to proclaim,<BR>
Should my resolve have good or evil game,<BR>
Hence I infer, unequal were the game,<BR>
If she and I in beauty should contend:<BR>
For if such strife &#8217;twixt her and me ensues,<BR>
Nought can the damsel gain, and much may lose;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And save the gain and loss well balanced be<BR>
In every match, the contest is unfair.<BR>
So that by right, no less than courtesy,<BR>
May she a shelter claim in you repair.<BR>
But are there any here that disagree,<BR>
And to impugn my equal sentence dare,<BR>
Behold my prompt, at such gainsayer&#8217;s will,<BR>
To prove my judgment right, his judgment ill!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant&#8212;grieved that maid of gentle kind<BR>
Should from that castle wrongfully be sped,<BR>
To bide the raging of the rain and wind,<BR>
Where sheltering house was none, nor even shed&#8212;<BR>
With reasons good, in wary speech combined,<BR>
Persuades that lord; but mostly what she said<BR>
On ending silences the knight; and he<BR>
Allows the justice of that damsel&#8217;s plea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
As when hot summer sun the soil has rived,<BR>
And most the thirsty plant of moisture drains,<BR>
The weak and wasting flower, well nigh deprived<BR>
Of that quick sap which circled in its veins,<BR>
Sucks in the welcome rain, and is revived;<BR>
So, when bold Bradamant so well maintains<BR>
The courier maid&#8217;s defence, her beauteous cheer<BR>
And mirth revive, and brighten as whilere.</TD></TR>

At length the supper, which had long been dight,<BR>
Nor yet was touched, enjoys each hungry guest;<BR>
Nor any further news of errant knight<BR>
Them, seated at the festive board, molest;<BR>
All, saving Bradamant, enjoy, whose sprite,<BR>
As wont, is still afflicted and opprest.<BR>
For that suspicious fear, that doubt unjust,<BR>
Which racked her bosom, marred the damsel&#8217;s gust.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
The supper done&#8212;brought sooner to a close<BR>
Haply from their desire to feast their eyes&#8212;<BR>
First of the set, Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter rose,<BR>
And next the courier maid is seen to rise.<BR>
With that the warder signs to one, that goes<BR>
And many torches fires in nimble wise;<BR>
Whose light on storied wall and ceiling fell.<BR>
What followed shall another canto tell.</TD></TR>
