<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Orlando, full of rage, pursues a knight<BR>
Who bears by force his lady-love away,<BR>
And comes where old Atlantes, by his sleight<BR>
Had raised a dome, Rogero there to stay.<BR>
Here too Rogero comes; where getting sight<BR>
Of his lost love, the County strives in fray<BR>
With fierce Ferrau, and, after slaughter fell<BR>
Amid the paynim host, finds Isabel.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Ceres, when from the Idaean dame in haste<BR>
Returning to the lonely valley, where<BR>
Enceladus the &AElig;tnaean mountain placed<BR>
On his bolt-smitten flanks, is doomed to bear,<BR>
Her girl she found not, on that pathless waste,<BR>
By her late quitted, having rent her hair,<BR>
And marked cheeks, eyes, and breast, with livid signs,<BR>
At the end of her lament tore up two pines,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
And lit at Vulcan&#8217;s fire the double brand,<BR>
And gave them virtue never to be spent;<BR>
And, afterwards, with one in either hand,<BR>
Drawn by two dragons, in her chariot went,<BR>
Searching the forest, hill, and level land,<BR>
Field, valley, running stream, or water pent,<BR>
The land and sea; and having searched the shell<BR>
Of earth above, descended into hell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Had Roland of Eleusis&#8217; deity<BR>
The sovereign power possessed no less than will,<BR>
He for Angelica had land and sea<BR>
Ransacked, and wood and field, and pool and rill,<BR>
Heaven, and Oblivion&#8217;s bottom: but since he<BR>
Had not, his pressing purpose to fulfil,<BR>
Her dragon and her car, the unwearied knight<BR>
Pursued the missing maid as best he might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Through France he sought her, and will seek her through<BR>
The realms of Italy and of Almayn,<BR>
And thence through the Castiles, both old and new,<BR>
So passing into Libya out of Spain.<BR>
While bold Orlando has this plan in view,<BR>
He hears, or thinks he hears, a voice complain:<BR>
He forward spurs, and sees on mighty steed<BR>
A warrior trot before him on the mead;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Who in his arms a captive damsel bears,<BR>
Sore grieving, and across the pommel laid;<BR>
She weeps and struggles, and the semblance wears<BR>
Of cruel woe, and ever calls for aid<BR>
Upon Anglantes&#8217; prince; and now appears<BR>
To him, as he surveys the youthful maid,<BR>
She, for whom, night and day, with ceaseless pain,<BR>
Inside and out, he France had searched in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
I say not is, but that she to the sight<BR>
Seems the Angelica he loves so dear.<BR>
He who is lady-love and goddess&#8217; flight<BR>
Beholds, borne off in such afflicted cheer,<BR>
Impelled by fury foul, and angry spite,<BR>
Calls back with horrid voice the cavalier;<BR>
Calls back the cavalier, and threats in vain,<BR>
And Brigliadoro drives with flowing rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
That felon stops not, nor to him replies,<BR>
On his great gain intent, his glorious prey;<BR>
And with such swiftness through the greenwood hies,<BR>
Wind would not overtake him on his way.<BR>
The one pursues while him the other flies,<BR>
And with lament resounds the thicket gray.<BR>
They issue in a spacious mead, on which<BR>
Appears a lofty mansion, rare and rich.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Of various marbles, wrought with subtle care,<BR>
Is the proud palace. He who fast in hold<BR>
Bears off upon his arm the damsel fair,<BR>
Sore pricking, enters at a gate of gold.<BR>
Nor Brigliador is far behind the pair,<BR>
Backed by Orlando, angry knight and bold.<BR>
Entering, around Orlando turns his eyes,<BR>
Yet neither cavalier nor damsel spies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
He suddenly dismounts, and thundering fares<BR>
Through the inmost palace, seeking still his foe,<BR>
And here and there in restless rage repairs,<BR>
Till he has seen each bower, each galleried row;<BR>
With the same purpose he ascends the stairs,<BR>
Having first vainly searched each room below.<BR>
Nor spends less labour, on his task intent,<BR>
Above, than he beneath had vainly spent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Here beds are seen adorned with silk and gold;<BR>
Nor of partition aught is spied or wall:<BR>
For these, and floor beneath, throughout that hold,<BR>
Are hid by curtains and by carpets all.<BR>
Now here, now there, returns Orlando bold,<BR>
Nor yet can glad his eyes, in bower or hall,<BR>
With the appearance of the royal maid,<BR>
Or the foul thief by whom she was conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
This while, as here and there in fruitless pain<BR>
He moves, oppressed with thought and trouble sore,<BR>
Gradasso, Brandimart, and him of Spain,<BR>
Ferrau, he finds, with Sacripant and more;<BR>
Who ever toiling, like himself, in vain<BR>
Above, that building, and beneath explore,<BR>
And as they wander, curse with one accord<BR>
The malice of the castle&#8217;s viewless lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
All in pursuit of the offender speed,<BR>
And upon him some charge of robbery lay:<BR>
One knight complains that he has stolen his steed,<BR>
One that he has purloined his lady gay.<BR>
Other accuses him of other deed:<BR>
And thus within the enchanted cage they stay,<BR>
Nor can depart; while in the palace pent,<BR>
Many have weeks and months together spent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Roland, when he round that strange dome had paced<BR>
Four times or six, still vainly seeking, said<BR>
Within himself, at last, &#8220;I here might waste<BR>
My time and trouble, still in vain delayed,<BR>
While haply her the robber whom I chased<BR>
Has far away, through other gate conveyed.&#8221;<BR>
So thinking, from the house he issued out<BR>
Into the mead which girt the dome about.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
While Roland wanders round the sylvan Hall,<BR>
Still holding close his visage to the ground,<BR>
To see if recent print or trace withal<BR>
Can, right or left, upon the turf be found,<BR>
He from a neighbouring window hears a call,<BR>
And looks, and thinks he hears that voice&#8217;s sound,<BR>
And thinks he sees the visage by which he<BR>
Was so estranged from what he wont to be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
He thinks he hears Angelica, and she<BR>
&#8220;Help, help!&#8221; entreating cries, and weeping sore,<BR>
&#8220;More than for life and soul, alas! of thee<BR>
Protection for my honour I implore.<BR>
Then shall it in my Roland&#8217;s presence be<BR>
Ravished by this foul robber? Oh! before<BR>
Me to such miserable fate you leave,<BR>
Let me from your own hand my death receive!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
These words repeated once, and yet again,<BR>
Made Roland through each chamber, far and near,<BR>
Return with passion, and with utmost pain;<BR>
But tempered with high hope. Sometimes the peer<BR>
Stopt in his search and heard a voice complain,<BR>
Which seemed to be Angelica&#8217;s: if here<BR>
The restless warrior stand, it sounds from there,<BR>
And calls for help he knows not whence nor where,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Returning to Rogero, left, I said,<BR>
When through a gloomy path, upon his steed,<BR>
Following the giant and the dame who fled,<BR>
He from the wood had issued on the mead;<BR>
I say that he arrived where Roland dread<BR>
Arrived before him, if I rightly read.<BR>
The giant through the golden portal passed,<BR>
Rogero close behind, who followed fast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
As soon as he his foot has lifted o&#8217;er<BR>
The threshold, he through court and gallery spies;<BR>
Nor sees the giant or the lady more,<BR>
And vainly glances here and there his eyes.<BR>
He up and down returns with labour sore,<BR>
Yet not for that his longing satisfies;<BR>
Nor can imagine where the felon thief<BR>
Has hid himself and dame in space so brief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
After four times or five he so had wound<BR>
Above, below, through bower and gallery fair,<BR>
He yet returned, and, having nothing found,<BR>
Searched even to the space beneath the stair.<BR>
At length, in hope they in the woodlands round<BR>
Might be, he sallied; but the voice, which there<BR>
Roland recalled, did him no less recall,<BR>
And made as well return within the Hall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
One voice, one shape, which to Anglantes&#8217; peer<BR>
Seemed his Angelica, beseeching aid.<BR>
Seemed to Rogero Dordogne&#8217;s lady dear.<BR>
Who him a truant to himself had made:<BR>
If with Gradasso, or with other near<BR>
He spake, of those who through the palace strayed.<BR>
To all of them the vision, seen apart,<BR>
Seemed that which each had singly most at heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
This was a new and unwonted spell,<BR>
Which the renowned Atlantes had composed,<BR>
That in this toil, this pleasing pain, might dwell<BR>
So long Rogero, by these walls enclosed,<BR>
From him should pass away the influence fell,<BR>
&#8212;Influence which him to early death exposed.<BR>
Though vain his magic tower of steel, and vain<BR>
Alcina&#8217;s art, Atlantes plots again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Not only he, but others who stood high<BR>
For valour, and in France had greatest fame,<BR>
That by their hands Rogero might not die,<BR>
Brought here by old Atlantes&#8217; magic came:<BR>
While these in the enchanted mansion lie,<BR>
That food be wanting not to knight or dame,<BR>
He has supplied the dome throughout so well,<BR>
That all the inmates there in plenty dwell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
But to Angelica return we, who<BR>
Now of that ring so wondrous repossessed,<BR>
(Which, in her mouth, concealed the maid from view,<BR>
Preserved from spell when it the finger pressed,)<BR>
Was in the mountain-cavern guided to<BR>
Whatever needed, viands, mare, and vest,<BR>
And had conceived the project to pursue<BR>
Her way to her fair Indian realm anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
King Sacripant, or Roland, willingly<BR>
The damsel would have taken for her guide;<BR>
Not that, propitious to their wishes, she<BR>
(Averse from both) inclined to either side;<BR>
But, since her eastern journey was to be<BR>
Through town and city, scattered far and wide,<BR>
She needed company, and ill had found<BR>
More trusty guides than these for such a round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Now this, now that she sought with fruitless care,<BR>
Before she lit on either warrior&#8217;s trace,<BR>
By city or by farm, now here, now there,<BR>
In forest now, and now in other place.<BR>
Fortune, at length, where caged with Roland are<BR>
Ferrau and Sacripant, directs her chase;<BR>
Rogero, with Gradasso fierce, and more,<BR>
Noosed with strange witcheries by Atlantes hoar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
She enters, hidden from the enchanter&#8217;s eyes,<BR>
And by the ring concealed, examines all;<BR>
And Roland there, and Sacripant espies,<BR>
Intent to seek her vainly through the Hall;<BR>
And with her image cheating both, descries<BR>
Atlantes old. The damsel doubts withal<BR>
Which of the two to take, and long revolves<BR>
This in her doubtful thought, nor well resolves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
She knows not which with her will best accord,<BR>
The Count Orlando or Circassia&#8217;s knight.<BR>
As of most powers, her would Rogero ward<BR>
In passage perilous, with better might.<BR>
But should she make the peer her guide, her lord,<BR>
She knew not if her champion she could slight,<BR>
If him she would depress with altered cheer,<BR>
Or into France send back the cavalier:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
But Sacripant at pleasure could depose,<BR>
Though him she had uplifted to the sky.<BR>
Hence him alone she for her escort chose,<BR>
And feigned to trust in his fidelity.<BR>
The ring she from her mouth withdraws, and shows<BR>
Her face, unveiled to the Circassian&#8217;s eye:<BR>
She thought to him alone; but fierce Ferrau<BR>
And Roland came upon the maid, and saw.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Ferrau and Roland came upon the maid;<BR>
For one and the other champion equally<BR>
Within the palace and without it strayed<BR>
In quest of her, who was their deity.<BR>
And now, no longer by the enchantment stayed,<BR>
Each ran alike towards the dame, for she<BR>
Had placed the ring upon her hand anew,<BR>
Which old Atlantes&#8217; every scheme o&#8217;erthrew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Helm on the head and corselet on the breast<BR>
Of both the knights, of whom I sing, was tied;<BR>
By night or day, since they into this rest<BR>
Had entered, never doffed and laid aside:<BR>
For such to wear were easy as a vest,<BR>
To these, so wont the burden to abide.<BR>
As well was armed, except with iron masque,<BR>
Ferrau, who wore not, nor would wear, a casque.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Till he had that erst wrested by the peer,<BR>
Orlando, from the brother of Troyane;<BR>
For so had sworn the Spanish cavalier,<BR>
What time he Argal&igrave;a&#8217;s helm in vain<BR>
Sought in the brook; yet though the count was near,<BR>
Has not stretched forth his hand the prize to gain.<BR>
For so it was, that neither of the pair<BR>
Could recognise the other knight while there.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell,<BR>
That they from one another were concealed;<BR>
They doffed not, night nor day, the corselet&#8217;s shell,<BR>
Not sword, nor even put aside the shield.<BR>
Saddled, with bridle hanging at the sell,<BR>
Their steeds were feeding, ready for the field,<BR>
Within a chamber, near the palace door,<BR>
With straw and barley heaped in plenteous store.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Nor might nor mean in old Atlantes lies<BR>
To stop the knights from mounting, who repair<BR>
To their good steeds, to chase the bright black eyes,<BR>
The fair vermillion cheeks and golden hair<BR>
Of the sweet damsel, who before them flies,<BR>
And goads to better speed her panting mare;<BR>
Ill pleased the three assembled to discern,<BR>
Though haply she had taken each in turn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
And when these from the magic palace she<BR>
Had ticed so far, that she no more supposed<BR>
The warriors to the wicked fallacy<BR>
Of the malign enchanter were exposed,<BR>
The ring, which more than once from misery<BR>
Had rescued her, she &#8217;twixt her lips enclosed,<BR>
Hence from their sight she vanished in a thought,<BR>
And left them wondering there, like men distraught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Although she first the scheme had entertained<BR>
Roland or Sacripant to have released,<BR>
To guide her thither, where her father reigned,<BR>
King Galaphron, who ruled i&#8217; the farthest East,<BR>
The aid of both she suddenly disdained,<BR>
And in an instant from her project ceased;<BR>
And deemed, without more debt to count or king,<BR>
In place of either knight sufficed the ring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
In haste, they through the forest, here and there,<BR>
So scorned of her, still gaze with stupid face;<BR>
Like questing hound which loses sight of hare<BR>
Or fox, of whom he late pursued the trace,<BR>
Into close thicket, ditch, or narrow lair,<BR>
Escaping from the keen pursuer&#8217;s chase.<BR>
Meantime their ways the wanton Indian queen<BR>
Observes, and at their wonder laughs unseen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
In the mid wood, where they the maid did lose,<BR>
Was but a single pathway, left or right;<BR>
Which they believed the damsel could not choose<BR>
But follow, when she vanished from their sight.<BR>
Ferrau halts not, and Roland fast pursues,<BR>
Nor Sacripant less plies the rowels bright.<BR>
Angelica, this while, retrains her steed,<BR>
And follows the three warriors with less speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
When pricking thus they came to where the way<BR>
Was in the forest lost, with wood o&#8217;ergrown,<BR>
And had begun the herbage to survey<BR>
For print of recent footsteps, up and down,<BR>
The fierce Ferrau, who might have borne away<BR>
From all that ever proudest were, the crown,<BR>
With evil countenance, to the other two<BR>
Turned him about, and shouted &#8220;Whence are you?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Turn back or take another road, save here,<BR>
In truth, you covet to be slain by me.<BR>
Nor when I chase or woo my lady dear,<BR>
Let any think I bear with company.&#8221;<BR>
And&#8212;&#8220;What more could he say, sir cavalier,&#8221;<BR>
(Orlando cried to Sacripant) &#8220;if we<BR>
Were known for the two basest whores that pull<BR>
And reel from spindle-staff the matted wool?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Then turning to Ferrau,, &#8220;But that thine head,<BR>
Thou brutish sot, as I behold, is bare,<BR>
If thy late words were ill or wisely said,<BR>
Thou should&#8217;st perceive, before we further fare.&#8221;<BR>
To him Ferrau: &#8220;For that which breeds no dread<BR>
In me, why should&#8217;st thou take such sovereign care?<BR>
What I have said unhelmed will I prove true,<BR>
Here, single as I am, on both of you.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; (to Circassia&#8217;s king cried Roland dread)<BR>
&#8220;Thy morion for this man let me entreat,<BR>
Till I have driven such folly from his head;<BR>
For never with like madness did I meet.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Who then would be most fool?&#8221; the monarch said;<BR>
&#8220;But if indeed you deem the suit discreet,<BR>
Lend him thine own; nor shall I be less fit<BR>
Haply than thee to school his lack of wit.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;Fools, both of you!&#8221; (the fierce Ferrau replied)<BR>
&#8220;As if, did I to wear a helm delight,<BR>
You would not be without your casques of pride,<BR>
Already reft by me in your despite;<BR>
But know thus much, that I by vow am tied<BR>
To wear no helm, and thus my promise quite;<BR>
Roaming without, till that fine casque I win<BR>
Worn by Orlando, Charles&#8217;s paladin.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;Then&#8221; (smiling, to the Spaniard said the count)<BR>
&#8220;With naked head, thou thinkest to repeat<BR>
On Roland what he did in Aspramont,<BR>
By Agolant&#8217;s bold son: but shouldst thou meet<BR>
The warrior whom thou seekest, front to front,<BR>
I warrant thou wouldst quake from head to feet;<BR>
Nor only wouldst forego the casque, but give<BR>
The knight thine other arms to let thee live.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;So oft have I had Roland on the hip,<BR>
And oft,&#8221; (exclaimed the boaster) &#8220;heretofore;<BR>
From him it had been easy task to strip<BR>
What other arms, beside his helm, he wore;<BR>
And if I still have let the occasion slip,<BR>
&#8212;We sometimes think of things unwished before:<BR>
Such wish I had not; I have now; and hope<BR>
To compass easily my present scope.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
The good Orlando could no more forbear,<BR>
And cried, &#8220;Foul miscreant, liar, marched with me,<BR>
Say, caitiff, in what country, when and where<BR>
Boast you to have obtained such victory?<BR>
That paladin am I, o&#8217;er whom you dare<BR>
To vaunt, and whom you distant deemed: now see<BR>
If you can take my helm, or I have might<BR>
To take your other arms in your despite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor I o&#8217;er you the smallest vantage wou&#8217;d.&#8221;<BR>
He ended, and his temples disarrayed,<BR>
And to a beech hung up the helmet good,<BR>
And nigh as quickly bared his trenchant blade.<BR>
Ferrau stands close, and in such attitude,<BR>
(His courage not for what had chanced dismayed)<BR>
Covered with lifted shield and naked sword,<BR>
As might best shelter to his head afford.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas thus those warriors two, with faulchions bare,<BR>
Turning their ready steeds, began to wheel;<BR>
And where the armour thinnest was, and where<BR>
The meeting plates were joined, probed steel with steel;<BR>
Nor was there in the world another pair<BR>
More fitted to be matched in fierce appeal:<BR>
Equal their daring, equal was their might,<BR>
And safe alike from wound was either knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
By you, fair sir, already, I presume,<BR>
That fierce Ferrau was charmed is understood,<BR>
Save where the child, enclosed within the womb<BR>
Of the full mother, takes its early food;<BR>
And hence he ever, till the squalid tomb<BR>
Covered his manly face, wore harness good<BR>
(Such was his wont) the doubtful part to guard,<BR>
Of seven good plates of metal, tempered hard.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Alike a charmed life Orlando bore,<BR>
Safe every where, except a single part:<BR>
Unfenced beneath his feet, which evermore<BR>
By him were guarded with all care and art.<BR>
The rest than diamond dug from mountain hoar<BR>
More hard, unless report from truth depart;<BR>
And armed to battle either champion went,<BR>
Less for necessity than ornament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Waxing more fierce and fell the combat rages,<BR>
Of fear and horror full, between the twain:<BR>
The fierce Ferrau such dreadful battle wages,<BR>
That stroke or thrust is never dealt in vain:<BR>
Each mighty blow from Roland disengages<BR>
And loosens, breaks, or shatters, plate and chain.<BR>
Angelica alone, secure from view,<BR>
Regards such fearful sight, and marks the two.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
For, during this, the king of Circassy,<BR>
Who deemed Angelica not far before,<BR>
When Ferrau and Orlando desperately<BR>
Closing in fight were seen, his horse did gore<BR>
Along the way by which he deemed that she<BR>
Had disappeared; and so that battle sore<BR>
Was witnessed &#8217;twixt the struggling foes, by none,<BR>
Beside the daughter of king Galaphron.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
After the damsel had sometime descried<BR>
This dread and direful combat, standing nigh;<BR>
And it appearing that on either side<BR>
With equal peril both the warriors vie,<BR>
She, fond of novelty, the helm untied<BR>
Designs to take; desirous to espy<BR>
What they would do when they perceived the wrong;<BR>
But, without thought to keep her plunder long.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
To give it to Orlando was she bent,<BR>
But first she would upon the warrior play:<BR>
The helmet she took down with this intent<BR>
And in her bosom hid, and marked the fray:<BR>
Next thence, without a word to either went,<BR>
And from the scene of strife was far away<BR>
Ere either of the two had marked the feat;<BR>
So were they blinded by their angry heat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
But Ferrau, who first chanced the loss to see,<BR>
From Roland disengaged himself, and cried,<BR>
&#8220;How like unwary men and fools are we<BR>
Treated by him, who late with us did ride!<BR>
What meed, which worthiest of the strife might be,<BR>
If this be stolen, the victor shall abide?&#8221;<BR>
Roland draws back, looks upward, and with ire,<BR>
Missing the noble casque, is all on fire:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
And in opinion with Ferrau agreed,<BR>
That he the knight, who was with them before,<BR>
Had born away the prize: hence turned his steed.<BR>
And with the spur admonished Brigliador.<BR>
Ferrau, who from the field beheld him speed.<BR>
Followed him, and when Roland and the Moor<BR>
Arrived where tracks upon the herbage green<BR>
Of the Circassian and the maid were seen,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Towards a vale upon the left the count<BR>
Went off, pursuing the Circassian&#8217;s tread;<BR>
The Spaniard kept the path more nigh the mount,<BR>
By which the fair Angelica had fled.<BR>
Angelica, this while, has reached a fount,<BR>
Of pleasant site, and shaded overhead;<BR>
By whose inviting shades no traveller hasted,<BR>
Nor ever left the chrystal wave untasted.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Angelica, the sylvan spring beside,<BR>
Reposes, unsuspicious of surprise;<BR>
And thinking her the sacred ring will hide,<BR>
Fears not that evil accident can rise.<BR>
On her arrival at the fountain&#8217;s side,<BR>
She to a branch above the helmet ties;<BR>
Then seeks the fittest sapling for her need,<BR>
Where, fastened to its trunk, her mare may feed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
The Spanish cavalier the stream beside<BR>
Arrived, who had pursued her traces there:<BR>
Angelica no sooner him espied,<BR>
Than she evanished clean, and spurred her mare:<BR>
The helm this while had dropt, but lay too wide<BR>
To be recovered of the flying fair.<BR>
As soon as sweet Angelica he saw,<BR>
Towards her full of rapture sprang Ferrau.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
She disappeared, I say, as forms avaunt<BR>
At sleep&#8217;s departure: toiling long and sore<BR>
He seeks the damsel there, &#8217;twixt plant and plant,<BR>
Now can his wretched eyes behold her more.<BR>
Blaspheming his Mahound and Termagant,<BR>
And cursing every master of his lore,<BR>
Ferrau returned towards the sylvan fount,<BR>
Where lay on earth the helmet of the count.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
This he soon recognised, for here he read<BR>
Letters upon the margin, written fair,<BR>
Which how Orlando won the helmet said;<BR>
And from what champion took, and when and where.<BR>
With it the paynim armed his neck and head,<BR>
Who would not for his grief the prize forbear;<BR>
His grief for loss of her, conveyed from sight,<BR>
As disappear the phantoms of the night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
When in this goodly casque he was arrayed,<BR>
He deemed nought wanting to his full content,<BR>
But the discovery of the royal maid,<BR>
Who like a flash of lightning came and went:<BR>
For her he searches every greenwood shade,<BR>
And when all hope of finding her is spent,<BR>
He for the vain pursuit no longer tarries,<BR>
But to the Spanish camp returns near Paris;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Tempering the grief which glowed within his breast,<BR>
For such sore disappointment, with the thought<BR>
That he was with Orlando&#8217;s morion blest,<BR>
As sworn. By good Anglante&#8217;s count, when taught<BR>
That the false Saracen the prize possest,<BR>
Long time the Spanish knight was vainly sought;<BR>
Nor Roland took the helmet from his head,<BR>
Till he between two bridges laid him dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Angelica thus, viewless and alone,<BR>
Speeds on her journey, but with troubled front;<BR>
Grieved for the helmet, in her haste foregone<BR>
On her departure from the grassy fount.<BR>
&#8220;Choosing to do what I should least have done,&#8221;<BR>
(She said) &#8220;I took his helmet from the count.<BR>
This for his first desert I well bestow;<BR>
A worthy recompense for all I owe!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With good intentions, as God knows, I wrought;<BR>
Though these an ill and different end produce;<BR>
I took the helmet only with the thought<BR>
To bring that deadly battle to a truce;<BR>
And not that this foul Spaniard what he sought<BR>
Should gain, or I to his intent conduce.&#8221;<BR>
So she, lamenting, took herself to task<BR>
For having robbed Orlando of his casque.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
By what appeared to her the meetest way,<BR>
Moody and ill-content she eastward pressed;<BR>
Ofttimes concealed, sometimes in face of day,<BR>
As seemed most opportune and pleased her best.<BR>
After much country seen, a forest gray<BR>
She reached, where, sorely wounded in mid breast,<BR>
Between two dead companions on the ground,<BR>
The royal maid a bleeding stripling found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
But of Angelica I now no more<BR>
Shall speak, who first have many things to say;<BR>
Nor shall to the Circassian or the Moor<BR>
Give for long space a rhyme; thence called away<BR>
By good Anglante&#8217;s prince, who wills, before<BR>
I of those others tell, I should display<BR>
The labours and the troubles he sustained,<BR>
Pursuing the great good he never gained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
At the first city, whither he was brought<BR>
(Because to go concealed he had good care),<BR>
He a new helmet donned; but took no thought<BR>
What was the head-piece he designed to bear.<BR>
So safe is he in fairy spell, it nought<BR>
Imports, if hard or soft its temper were.<BR>
Orlando, covered thus, pursues the quest,<BR>
Nor him day, night, or rain, or sun arrest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
It was the hour that our of Ocean&#8217;s bed<BR>
Dan Ph&#339;bus drew his dripping steeds, and high<BR>
And low, still scattering yellow flowers and red,<BR>
Aurora stained the heavens with various dye,<BR>
And Stars had cast their veils about their head,<BR>
Departing from their revels in the sky;<BR>
When passing on a day fair Paris near,<BR>
Orlando made his mighty worth appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Two squadrons he encountered; one an old<BR>
Saracen, Manilardo clept, obeyed;<BR>
King of Noritia, whilom fierce and bold.<BR>
But fitter now to counsel than to aid.<BR>
The next beneath the standard was enrolled<BR>
Or Tremisena&#8217;s monarch, who was said<BR>
&#8217;Mid Africans to be a perfect knight;<BR>
Alzirdo he by those who knew him, hight:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
These, with the other Saracen array,<BR>
Cantoned throughout the winter months had lain,<BR>
Some near the city, some more far away,<BR>
All lodged nigh town or hamlet on the plain.<BR>
For since King Agramant had many a day<BR>
Spent in attacking Paris&#8217; walls in vain,<BR>
He (for no other means remained to try)<BR>
Would lastly with a siege the city ply;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
And to do this had people infinite:<BR>
Since he, beside the host that with him came,<BR>
And that of Spain which followed to the fight<BR>
The Spanish King Marsilius&#8217; oriflame,<BR>
Many of France did in his pay unite:<BR>
For all from Paris he to Arles&#8217;s stream,<BR>
With part of Gascony, some straggling tower<BR>
Excepted, had reduced beneath his power.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
The quivering brook, as warmer breezes blew,<BR>
Beginning now from ice its waves to free,<BR>
And the fresh-springing grass and foliage new,<BR>
To cloathe again the field and greenwood tree,<BR>
All those King Agramant assembled, who<BR>
Had followed him in his prosperity;<BR>
To muster in review the armed swarm,<BR>
And give to his affairs a better form:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Hence did the King of Tremisen&#8217; repair,<BR>
With him who had Noritia in command,<BR>
To be in time at that full muster, where<BR>
Each squadron, good or bad, was to be scanned<BR>
Orlando thus by chance encountered there,<BR>
As I have told you, this united hand;<BR>
Who, as his usage was, went seeking her,<BR>
By whom he had been made Love&#8217;s prisoner.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Alzirdo, as the approaching count he eyes,<BR>
Who in this world for valour has no peer,<BR>
With such a haughty front, and in such guise,<BR>
The God of war would less in arms appear,<BR>
The features known before astounded spies,<BR>
The fierce, disdainful glance and furious cheer;<BR>
And him esteems a knight of prowess high,<BR>
Which, fondly, he too sore desires to try.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Arrogant, young, and of redoubted force,<BR>
Alzirdo was, and prized for dauntless mind;<BR>
Who bent to joust pricked forth his foaming horse,<BR>
Happier had he remained in line behind!<BR>
Met by Anglante&#8217;s prince in middle course,<BR>
Who pierced his heart as they encountering joined.<BR>
Frighted, the lightened courser scoured the plain,<BR>
Without a rider to direct the rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Rises a sudden and a horrid cry,<BR>
And air on every side repeats the scream;<BR>
As his scared band the falling youth descry,<BR>
And issuing from his wound so wide a stream:<BR>
Disordered, they the count in fury ply,<BR>
And, raised to cut or thrust, their weapons gleam.<BR>
Against that flower of knights, their feathered reeds,<BR>
A thicker squadron yet in tempest speeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
With sound like that, with which from hill repair,<BR>
Or from the champaign&#8217;s flat the hurrying swine,<BR>
(If the Wolf, issue from his grot, or Bear,<BR>
Descending to the mountains&#8217; lower line,<BR>
Some bristly youngling take away and tear,<BR>
Who with loud squeal and grunt is heard to pine)<BR>
Came driving at the count the barbarous rout;<BR>
&#8220;Upon him!&#8221; and &#8220;upon him!&#8221; still their shout.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
At once spears, shafts, and swords, his corslet bore<BR>
By thousands, and as many pierce his shield.<BR>
This threatens on one side, and that before,<BR>
And those the ponderous mace behind him wield.<BR>
But he esteems the craven rout no more.<BR>
He, who did never yet to terror yield,<BR>
Than hungry Wolf in twilight makes account<BR>
To what the number of the flock may mount.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
He held unsheathed that thundering sword in hand,<BR>
Which with so many foes has heaped the plain,<BR>
That he who thinks to count the slaughtered band,<BR>
Has undertaken, hard emprize and vain.<BR>
The road ran red, ensanguined by his brand,<BR>
And scarce capacious of the many slain.<BR>
For neither targe nor head-piece good defends,<BR>
Where fatal Durindana&#8217;s blade descends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Nor safety cotton vest, nor cloths supply,<BR>
In thousand folds about the temples spread:<BR>
Nor only groan and lamentation fly<BR>
Through air, but shoulder, arm, and severed head,<BR>
Death roams the field in strange variety<BR>
Of horrid forms, and all inspiring dread;<BR>
And says, &#8220;For hundreds of my scythes may stand<BR>
His Durindana in Orlando&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
His ceaseless strokes scarce one the other wait:<BR>
Speedily all his foemen are in flight.<BR>
And when before they came at furious rate,<BR>
They hoped to swallow quick the single knight.<BR>
None is there who, in that unhappy straight,<BR>
Stops for his comrade, flying from the fight.<BR>
Here one man speeds afoot, one gallops there;<BR>
None stays to question if the road be fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
His mirror Valour bore about, and here<BR>
Each blemish of the soul was seen confest:<BR>
None looked therein, except an aged peer,<BR>
Whose blood was chilled, but courage unreprest.<BR>
That death were better deems this cavalier<BR>
Than life in flight, and in disgrace possest:<BR>
I mean Noritia&#8217;s king, who lays his lance<BR>
In rest against the paladin of France;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
He broke it on the border of the shield<BR>
Of the intrepid count, with stedfast hand,<BR>
Who, by the stroke unshaken, nothing reeled:<BR>
And smote the king, in passing, with his brand.<BR>
Him Fortune saved; for as Orlando wheeled<BR>
The blade, it turned, descending, in his hand.<BR>
Although an-edge he guides not still the sword,<BR>
Stunned from his saddle reels the paynim lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Astounded from his saddle reels the king,<BR>
Nor him Orlando turns about to see.<BR>
He cuts, and cleaves, and slays his following;<BR>
Who all believe him at their backs to be.<BR>
As through the spacious air, with troubled wing,<BR>
The starlings from the daring merlin flee;<BR>
So, of that broken squadron, scattered round,<BR>
Some fly, some dip, and some fall flat to ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
He ceased not his ensanguined blade to sway<BR>
Till living wight remained not in his view.<BR>
Orlando doubted to resume his way,<BR>
Although the country all about he knew.<BR>
Does he the right or left-hand road assay,<BR>
His thoughts still rove from what his steps pursue,<BR>
And he to seek the damsel is in dread<BR>
Through other path than that by which she fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Through wood and field his courser did he goad,<BR>
Often inquiring for the royal dame:<BR>
Beside himself, he strayed beside his road,<BR>
And to the foot of rising mountain came,<BR>
Whence (it was night-time) through a fissure glowed<BR>
The distant flicker of a quivering flame.<BR>
Orlando to the rock approached, to spy<BR>
If there Angelica concealed might lie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
As where low junipers o&#8217;er shade her lair,<BR>
Or in the stubble of the open lay,<BR>
What time the hunters seek the fearful hare<BR>
Through traversed woods, and through uncertain way,<BR>
&#8212;Lest peradventure she be hidden there,<BR>
They every bramble, every bush assay;<BR>
Even so, where hope the toiling warrior leads,<BR>
Searching his lady-love, Orlando speeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Pricking in haste towards that ray, the count<BR>
Arrived where in the wood the light was shed,<BR>
Forth-streaming from a crevice in the mount,<BR>
Within whose womb a spacious grotto spread;<BR>
And there, like wall or bank, discerned in front,<BR>
Of thorns and underwood a bristly bed,<BR>
To hide the grotto&#8217;s inmates, and defend<BR>
From scathe or scorn, which others might intend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
By day it had been hidden evermore;<BR>
But the clear flame betrayed the haunt by night.<BR>
Its use he guessed; but would the place explore,<BR>
And better certify himself by sight.<BR>
When he without had tied his Brigliador,<BR>
In silence to the grotto stole the knight;<BR>
Threading the shrubs; nor calling for a guide,<BR>
Entered the passage in the mountain&#8217;s side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
By a long flight of steps was the descent<BR>
Into the cave; where, in the rocky tomb,<BR>
Buried were living folk. Of wide extent,<BR>
The grot was chiselled into vaulted room;<BR>
Nor was, although its entrance little lent,<BR>
All daylight wanting to disperse the gloom:<BR>
For much was furnished by a window dight,<BR>
Within a natural fissure on the right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
In the mid cave, beside a fire was seen<BR>
A gentle maid of pleasing look and guise;<BR>
Who seemed to Roland little past fifteen,<BR>
As far as at first sight he might surmise.<BR>
With that so fair she made the rugged scene<BR>
Seem in the warrior&#8217;s sight a paradise.<BR>
Although this while her eyes with tears o&#8217;erflow,<BR>
Clear tokens of a heart oppressed with woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
An aged dame was with her, and the pair<BR>
Wrangled, as oftentimes is women&#8217;s way;<BR>
But when the County was descending there,<BR>
Concluded the dispute and wordy fray.<BR>
Orlando hastens to salute them fair<BR>
(As still is due to womankind) and they<BR>
To welcome him rise lightly form their seat,<BR>
And with benign return the warrior greet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis true, that when that sudden voice they hear,<BR>
Somedeal confused in look they seem to be,<BR>
At the same time beholding thus appear<BR>
So fierce a wight, and harnessed cap-a-pee.<BR>
&#8220;What wight&#8221; (demands Anglantes&#8217; cavalier)<BR>
So barbarous is, and void of courtesy,<BR>
That he keeps buried, in this rude repair,<BR>
A face so gentle and so passing fair?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
With pain the virgin to the count replies,<BR>
As he inquires of her unhappy doom,<BR>
In sweet and broken accents, which by sighs<BR>
Impelled, through rows of pearl and coral come:<BR>
And between rose and lily, from her eyes<BR>
Tears fall so fast, she needs must swallow some.<BR>
In other canto, sir, be pleased to attend<BR>
The rest, for here &#8217;tis time my strain should end.</TD></TR>
