<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
While with the fierce Marphisa at despite<BR>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter wages fierce affray,<BR>
One and the other host engage in fight.<BR>
With Bradamant Rogero wends his way.<BR>
With other war disturbs their great delight<BR>
Marphisa bold; but when that martial may<BR>
Has for her brother recognized the peer,<BR>
They end their every strife with joyous cheer.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Where&#8217;er they be, all hearts of gentle strain<BR>
Still cannot choose but courtesy pursue;<BR>
For they from nature and from habit gain<BR>
What they henceforth can never more undo.<BR>
Alike the heart that is of churlish vein,<BR>
Where&#8217;er it be, its evil kind will shew.<BR>
Nature inclines to ill, through all her range,<BR>
And use is second nature, hard to change.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Among the warriors of antiquity<BR>
Much gentleness and courtesy appear,<BR>
Virtues but seldom seen with us; while we<BR>
Of evil ways, on all sides, see and hear.<BR>
Hippolytus, when you, with ensignry<BR>
Won from the foe, and with his captive gear<BR>
Adorned our temples; and his galleys bore,<BR>
Laden with prey, to your paternal shore;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
All the inhuman deeds which wrought by hand<BR>
Of Moor, or Turk, or Tartar ever were,<BR>
(Yet not by the Venetians&#8217; ill command,<BR>
That evermore the praise of justice bear,)<BR>
Were practised by that foul and evil band<BR>
Of soldiers, who their mercenaries are.<BR>
Of those so many fires not now I tell<BR>
Which on our farms and pleasant places fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Though a foul vengeance in that blow was meant<BR>
Mainly at you, who being at Caesar&#8217;s side,<BR>
When Padua by his leaguering host was pent,<BR>
&#8217;Twas known, that oft, through you, was turned aside<BR>
More than one ravening flame, and oft was spent<BR>
The fire, in fane and village blazing wide:<BR>
What time the destined mischief ye withstood,<BR>
As to your inborn courtesy seemed good.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
This will I pass, nor their so many more<BR>
Discourteous and despiteous doings tell,<BR>
Save one alone, whereat from rock-stone hoar<BR>
Whene&#8217;er the tale is told warm tears might well.<BR>
That day you sent your family before,<BR>
Thither, my lord, where, under omens fell,<BR>
Your foes into a well protected seat,<BR>
Abandoning their barks, had made retreat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
As Hector and Aeneas, mid the flood,<BR>
Fire to the banded fleet of Greece applied,<BR>
I Hercules and Alexander viewed,<BR>
Urged by too sovereign ardour, side by side,<BR>
Spurring before all others in their mood,<BR>
Even within the hostile ramparts ride;<BR>
And prick so far, the second &#8217;scaped with pain,<BR>
And on the foremost closed the opposing train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Feruffine &#8217;scaped, the good Cantelmo left,<BR>
What counsel, Sora&#8217;s duke, was thine, what heart,<BR>
When thy bold son thou saw&#8217;st, of helm bereft,<BR>
Amid a thousand swords, when&#8212;dragged apart&#8212;<BR>
Thou saw&#8217;st his young head from his shoulders cleft,<BR>
A shipboard, on a plank? I, on my part,<BR>
Marvel, that seeing but the murder done,<BR>
Slew thee not, as the faulchion slew thy son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Cruel Sclavonian! say, whence hast thou brought<BR>
Thy ways of warfare? By what Scythian rite<BR>
To slay the helpless prisoner is it taught,<BR>
Who yields his arms, nor fends himself in fight?<BR>
Was it a crime he for his country fought?<BR>
Ill upon thee the sun bestows his light.<BR>
Remorseless aera, which hast filled the page<BR>
With Atreus&#8217;, Tantalus&#8217;, Thyestes&#8217; rage!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Barbarian! thou madest shorter by the head<BR>
The boldest of his age, on whom did beam<BR>
The sun &#8217;twixt pole and pole, &#8217;twixt Indus&#8217; bed<BR>
And where he sinks in Ocean&#8217;s western stream;<BR>
Whose years and beauty might have pity bred<BR>
In Anthropophagus, in Polypheme;<BR>
Not thee; that art in wickedness outdone<BR>
By any Cyclops, any Lestrigon.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
I ween, mid warriors in the days of yore,<BR>
No such example was; they all, in field,<BR>
Were full of gentleness and courteous lore,<BR>
Nor against conquered foe their bosom steeled.<BR>
Not only gentle Bradamant forbore<BR>
To harm the knights whom, smitten on the shield,<BR>
Her lance unhorsed; but for the vanquished crew<BR>
Detained their steeds, that they might mount anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
I of that lady fair, of mickle might,<BR>
Told you above, how she had overthrown<BR>
Serpentine of the Star in single fight,<BR>
Grandonio and Ferrau, and then upon<BR>
Their coursers had replaced each baffled knight.<BR>
I told moreover how the third was gone<BR>
Rogero to defy to the career,<BR>
Upon her call, who seemed a cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Rogero heard the call in joyous vein,<BR>
And bade his arms be brought; now while in view<BR>
Of Agramant he donned the plate and chain,<BR>
Those lords the former question moved anew;<BR>
Who was the knight, that on the martial plain<BR>
The manage of the lance so quaintly knew?<BR>
And of Ferrau, who spake with him whilere,<BR>
Craved, if to him was known that cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Be ye assured,&#8221; to them Ferrau replied,<BR>
&#8220;He is not one of those I hear you cite<BR>
To me (for I his open face descried).<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s youthful brother seemed the knight.<BR>
But since his doughty valour I have tried,<BR>
And wot not such is Richardetto&#8217;s might,<BR>
I ween it is his sister, who, I hear,<BR>
Resembles much in mien that martial peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The damsel equals well, so Rumour tells,<BR>
Rinaldo, and every paladin in fray.<BR>
But brother she and cousin both excels,<BR>
Measured by that which I have seen to-day.&#8221;<BR>
Hearing him, while upon her praise he dwells,<BR>
As the sky reddens with the morning ray,<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s face is flushed with crimson hue,<BR>
And his heart throbs, nor knows he what to do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Stung, at these tidings, by the amorous dart&#8212;<BR>
Within, new fire inflames the cavalier;<BR>
And strait, together with the burning smart,<BR>
Shoots through his bones a chill, produced by fear;<BR>
Fear, that new wrath had stifled in her heart<BR>
That mighty love, wherewith she burned whilere.<BR>
Confused he stands, irresolute and slow,<BR>
And undecided if to stay or go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Now fierce Marphisa, who was there, and prest<BR>
By huge desire to meet the stranger wight,<BR>
And armed withal (for, save in iron vest,<BR>
Her seldom would you find by day or night).<BR>
Hearing Rogero is in armour drest,<BR>
Fearing to lose the honour of the fight,<BR>
If first that champion with the stranger vies;<BR>
Thinks to prevent the youth and win the prize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
She leapt upon her horse, and thither hied<BR>
Where Aymon&#8217;s daughter on the listed plain,<BR>
With palpitating heart, upon her side,<BR>
Waited Rogero; whom the damsel fain<BR>
Would make her prisoner, and but schemed to guide<BR>
Her lance in mode the stripling least to pain.<BR>
Marphisa from the city portal fares,<BR>
And on her gallant helm a phoenix wears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Whether the maid would publish, in her pride,<BR>
That she was single in the world, for might;<BR>
Or whether by that symbol signified,<BR>
That she would live, exempt from bridal rite.<BR>
Her closely Aymon&#8217;s martial daughter eyed;<BR>
When seeing not those features, her delight,<BR>
She craves the damsel&#8217;s name before they move,<BR>
And hears that it is she who joys her love:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Or rather she, that gentle lady thought,<BR>
Had joyed her love; and whom she hated so,<BR>
Her to Death&#8217;s door her anger would have brought,<BR>
Unless she venged her sorrow on the foe.<BR>
She wheeled her courser round, with fury fraught,<BR>
Less with desire to lay her rival low,<BR>
Than with the lance to pierce her in mid breast,<BR>
And put her every jealousy at rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Parforce to ground must go the royal maid,<BR>
To prove it hard or soft the listed plain,<BR>
And be with such unwonted scorn appaid,<BR>
That she is nearly maddened by disdain.<BR>
Scarce was she thrown, before her trenchant blade<BR>
She bared, and hurried to avenge the stain.<BR>
Cried Aymon&#8217;s daughter, no less proud of heart,<BR>
&#8220;What art thou doing? Thou my prisoner art.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though I have courtesy for others, none&#8221;<BR>
(She said) &#8220;from me, Marphisa, shalt thou find.<BR>
Since evermore I hear of thee, as one<BR>
To pride and every churlishness inclined.&#8221;<BR>
Marphisa, at these words, was heard to groan,<BR>
As roars in some sea-rock the prisoned wind.<BR>
She screamed an answer; but its sense was drowned<BR>
(Such rage confused that damsel) in the sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
She whirls this while her faulchion, and would fain<BR>
Wound horse or rider in the paunch or breast;<BR>
But Aymon&#8217;s watchful daughter turns the rein;<BR>
And on one side her courser leaps; possest<BR>
With furious anger and with fierce disdain,<BR>
She at her opposite her lance addrest;<BR>
And hardly touched the damsel, ere, astound,<BR>
Marphisa fell, reversed upon the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Scarce down, Marphisa started from the plain,<BR>
Intent fell mischief with her sword to do,<BR>
Bradamant couched her golden spear again,<BR>
And yet again the damsel overthrew.<BR>
Yet Bradamant, though blest with might and main,<BR>
Was not so much the stronger of the two<BR>
As to have flung the maid in every just,<BR>
But that such power was in the lance&#8217;s thrust.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
This while some knights (some knights upon our side,<BR>
I say) forth issuing from the city, go<BR>
Towards the field of strife, which did divide<BR>
The squadrons, here and there, of either foe<BR>
&#8212;Not half a league of one another wide&#8212;<BR>
Seeing their knight such mighty prowess show;<BR>
Their knight, but whom no otherwise they knew<BR>
Than as a warrior of the Christian crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Troyano&#8217;s generous son, who had espied<BR>
This band approaching to the city-wall,<BR>
For due defence would every means provide,<BR>
And every peril, every case forestall:<BR>
And orders many to take arms, who ride<BR>
Forth from the ramparts, at the monarch&#8217;s call.<BR>
With them Rogero goes, in armour cased,<BR>
Balked of the battle by Marphisa&#8217;s haste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
The enamoured youth, with beating heart, intent,<BR>
Stood by, the issue of the just to view.<BR>
For his dear cousin fearing the event,<BR>
In that he well Marphisa&#8217;s valour knew;<BR>
&#8212;At the beginning I would say&#8212;when, bent<BR>
On mischief, fiercely closed the furious two:<BR>
But when that duel&#8217;s turn the stripling eyes,<BR>
He stands amazed and stupid with surprize;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
And when he saw unfinished was the fight,<BR>
At the first onset, like the justs whilere,<BR>
Misdoubting some strange accident, in sprite,<BR>
Sore vexed, this while remained the cavalier.<BR>
To either maid wished well that youthful knight;<BR>
For both were loved, but not alike were dear.<BR>
For this the stripling&#8217;s love was fury, fire;<BR>
For that &#8217;twas rather fondness than desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
If so Rogero could with honour do,<BR>
He willingly the warriors would divide;<BR>
But his companions, in the fear to view<BR>
Victory with King Charles&#8217;s knight abide,<BR>
Esteeming him the better of the two,<BR>
Break in between and turn their arms aside;<BR>
Upon the other part, the Christian foes<BR>
Advance, and both divisions come to blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
On this side and that other, rings the alarm,<BR>
Which in those camps is sounded every day,<BR>
Bidding the unmounted mount, the unarmed arm,<BR>
And all their standards seek, without delay,<BR>
Where, under separate flags, the squadrons swarm,<BR>
More than one shrilling trump is heard to bray;<BR>
And as their rattling notes the riders call,<BR>
Rousing the foot, beat drum and ataball.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
As fierce as thought could think, &#8217;twixt either host<BR>
Kindled the fell and sanguinary fray.<BR>
The daring damsel, fair Dordona&#8217;s boast,<BR>
Sore vexed and troubled, that in the affray<BR>
She cannot compass what she covets most,<BR>
&#8212;Marphisa with avenging steel to slay,&#8212;<BR>
Now here, not there, amid the medley flies,<BR>
Hoping to see the youth for whom she sighs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
By the eagle argent on the shield of blue<BR>
She recognized Rogero, mid the rest.<BR>
With eyes and thought intent, she stops to view<BR>
The warrior&#8217;s manly shoulders and his breast,<BR>
Fair face and movements full of graceful shew;<BR>
And then the maid, with mickle spite possest,<BR>
Thinking another joys the stripling&#8217;s love,<BR>
Thus speaks, as sovereign rage and fury move.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Shall then another kiss those lips so bright<BR>
And sweet, if those fair lips are lost to me?<BR>
Ah! never other shall in thee delight;<BR>
For it not mine, no other&#8217;s shalt thou be.<BR>
Rather than die alone and of despite,<BR>
I with this hand will slay myself and thee,<BR>
That if I lose thee here, at least in hell<BR>
With thee I to eternity may dwell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If thou slay&#8217;st me, there is good reason, I<BR>
The comfort too of vengeance should obtain;<BR>
In that all edicts and all equity<BR>
The death of him that causes death ordain;<BR>
Nor, since you justly, I unjustly, die,<BR>
Deem I that thine is equal to my pain.<BR>
I him who seeks my life, alas! shall spill,<BR>
Thou her that loves and worships thee wouldst kill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My hand, why hast thou not the hardiment<BR>
To rive with steel the bosom of my foe,<BR>
That me so many times to death has shent,<BR>
Under the faith of love, in peaceful show;<BR>
Him, who to take my life can now consent,<BR>
Nor even have pity of my cruel woe?<BR>
Dare, valiant heart, this impious man to slay,<BR>
And let his death my thousand deaths appay!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
So said, she spurred at him amid the throng;<BR>
But, first&#8212;&#8220;Defend thee, false Rogero!&#8221;&#8212;cried.<BR>
&#8220;No more, if I have power, in spoil and wrong,<BR>
Done to a virgin heart, shalt thou take pride.&#8221;<BR>
Hearing that voice the hostile ranks among,<BR>
He deems&#8212;and truly deems&#8212;he hears his bride;<BR>
Whose voice the youth remembers in such wise,<BR>
That mid a thousand would he recognize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Her further meaning well did he divine,<BR>
Weening that him she in that speech would blame,<BR>
For having broke their pact; and&#8212;with design,<BR>
The occasion of his failure to proclaim,&#8212;<BR>
Of his desire for parley made a sign:<BR>
But she, with vizor closed, already came,<BR>
Raging and grieved, intent, with vengeful hand,<BR>
To fling the youth; nor haply upon sand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Rogero, when he saw her so offended,<BR>
Fixed himself firmly in his arms and seat,<BR>
He rests his lance, but holds the stave suspended,<BR>
So that it shall not harm her when they meet,<BR>
She that to smite and pierce the Child intended,<BR>
Pitiless, and inflamed with furious heat,<BR>
Has not the courage, when she sees him near,<BR>
To fling, or do him outrage with the spear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Void of effect, &#8217;tis thus their lances go;<BR>
And it is well; since Love with burning dart,<BR>
Tilting this while at one and the other foe,<BR>
Has lanced the enamoured warriors in mid-heart.<BR>
Unable at the Child to aim her blow,<BR>
The lady spent her rage in other part,<BR>
And mighty deeds achieved, which fame will earn,<BR>
While overhead the circling heavens shall turn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Above three hundred men in that affray<BR>
In little space by her dismounted lie,<BR>
Alone that warlike damsel wins the day;<BR>
From her alone the Moorish people fly.<BR>
To her Rogero, circling, threads his way,<BR>
And says: &#8220;Unless I speak with you I die.<BR>
Hear me, for love of heaven!&#8212;what done I done,<BR>
Alas! that ever mine approach ye shun?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
As when soft southern breezes are unpent,<BR>
Which with a tepid breath from seaward blow,<BR>
The snows dissolve, and torrents find a vent,<BR>
And ice, so hard erewhile, is seen to flow;<BR>
At those entreaties, at that brief lament,<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s sister&#8217;s heart is softened so;<BR>
Forthwith compassionate and pious grown;<BR>
Which anger fain had made more hard than stone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
Would she not, could she not, she nought replied,<BR>
But spurred aslant the ready Rabicane,<BR>
And, signing to Rogero, rode as wide<BR>
As she could wend from that embattled train;<BR>
Then to a sheltered valley turned aside,<BR>
Wherein embosomed was a little plain.<BR>
In the mid lawn a wood of cypress grew,<BR>
Whose saplings of one stamp appeared to view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
Within that thicket, of white marble wrought,<BR>
Is a proud monument, and newly made;<BR>
And he that makes enquiry, here is taught<BR>
In few brief verses who therein is laid.<BR>
But of those lines, methinks, took little thought,<BR>
Fair Bradamant, arriving in that glade.<BR>
Rogero spurred his courser, and pursued<BR>
And overtook that damsel in the wood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
But turn we to Marphisa, that anew<BR>
During this space was seated on her steed,<BR>
And sought again the valiant champion, who<BR>
At the first onset cast her on the mead;<BR>
And saw, how from the mingling host withdrew<BR>
Rogero, after that strange knight to speed;<BR>
Nor deemed the youth pursued in love; she thought<BR>
He but to end their strife and quarrel sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
She pricks her horse behind the two, and gains,<BR>
Well nigh as soon as they, that valley; how<BR>
Her coming thither either lover pains,<BR>
Who lives and loves, untaught by me, may know:<BR>
But sorest vext sad Bradamant remains;<BR>
Beholding her whence all her sorrows flow.<BR>
Who shall persuade the damsel but that love<BR>
For young Rogero brings her to that grove?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
And him perfidious she anew did name.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Perfidious, was it not enough (she said)<BR>
That I should know thy perfidy from fame,<BR>
But must the witness of thy guilt be made?<BR>
I wot, to drive me from thee is thine aim;<BR>
And I, that thy desires may be appaid,<BR>
Will die; but strive, in yielding up my breath,<BR>
She too shall die, the occasion of my death.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Angrier than venomed viper, with a bound,<BR>
So saying, she upon Marphisa flies;<BR>
And plants so well the spear, that she, astound,<BR>
Fell backward on the champaigne in such guise,<BR>
Nigh half her helm was buried in the ground:<BR>
Nor was the damsel taken by surprise:<BR>
Nay, did her best the encounter to withstand;<BR>
Yet with her helmed head she smote the sand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant who will die, or in that just<BR>
Will put to death Marphisa, rages so,<BR>
She has no mind again with lance to thrust,<BR>
Again that martial maid to overthrow:<BR>
But thinks her head to sever from the bust,<BR>
Where it half buried lies, with murderous blow:<BR>
Away the enchanted lance that damsel flings,<BR>
Unsheathes the sword, and from her courser springs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
But is too slow withal; for on her feet<BR>
She finds Marphisa, with such fierce disdain<BR>
Inflamed, at being in that second heat<BR>
So easily reversed upon the plain,<BR>
She hears in vain exclaim, in vain entreat,<BR>
Rogero, who beholds their strife with pain.<BR>
So blinded are the pair with spite and rage,<BR>
That they with desperate fury battle wage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
At half-sword&#8217;s engage the struggling foes;<BR>
And&#8212;such their stubborn mood&#8212;with shortened brand<BR>
They still approach, and now so fiercely close,<BR>
They cannot choose but grapple, hand to hand.<BR>
Her sword, no longer needful, each foregoes;<BR>
And either now new means of mischief planned.<BR>
Rogero both implores with earnest suit:<BR>
But supplicates the twain with little fruit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
When he entreaties unavailing found,<BR>
The youth prepared by force to part the two;<BR>
Their poniards snatched away, and on the ground,<BR>
Beneath a cypress-tree, the daggers threw.<BR>
When they no weapons have wherewith to wound,<BR>
With prayer and threat, he interferes anew:<BR>
But vainly; for, since better weapons lack,<BR>
Each other they with fists and feet attack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Rogero ceased not from his task; he caught,<BR>
By hand or arm, the fiercely struggling pair,<BR>
Till to the utmost pitch of fury wrought<BR>
The fell Marphisa&#8217;s angry passions were.<BR>
She, that this ample world esteemed at nought,<BR>
Of the Child&#8217;s friendship had no further care.<BR>
Plucked from the foe, she ran to seize her sword,<BR>
And fastened next upon that youthful lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Like a discourteous man and churl ye do,<BR>
Rogero, to disturb another&#8217;s fight;<BR>
A deed (she cried) this hand shall make ye rue,<BR>
Which I intend, shall vanquished both.&#8221; The knight<BR>
Sought fierce Marphisa&#8217;s fury to subdue<BR>
With gentle speech; but full of such despite<BR>
He found her, and inflamed with such disdain,<BR>
All parley was a waste of time and pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
At last his faulchion young Rogero drew;<BR>
For ire as well had flushed that cavalier:<BR>
Nor is it my belief, that ever shew<BR>
Athens or Rome, or city whatsoe&#8217;er<BR>
Witnessed, which ever so rejoiced the view,<BR>
As this rejoices, as this sight is dear<BR>
To Bradamant, when, through their strife displaced,<BR>
Every suspicion from her breast is chased.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Bradamant took her sword, and to descry<BR>
The duel of those champions stood apart.<BR>
The god of war, descended from the sky,<BR>
She deemed Rogero, for his strength and art:<BR>
If he seemed Mars, Marphisa to the eye<BR>
Seemed an infernal Fury, on her part.<BR>
&#8217;Tis true, that for a while the youthful knight<BR>
Against that damsel put not forth his might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
He knew the virtues of that weapon well,<BR>
Such proof thereof the knight erewhile had made.<BR>
Where&#8217;er it falls parforce is every spell<BR>
Annulled, or by its stronger virtue stayed.<BR>
Hence so Rogero smote, it never fell<BR>
Upon its edge or point, but still the blade<BR>
Descended flat: he long this rule observes;<BR>
Yet once he from his patient purpose swerves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
In that, a mighty stroke Marphisa sped,<BR>
Meaning to cleave the brainpan of her foe:<BR>
He raised the buckler to defend his head,<BR>
And the sword smote upon its bird of snow,<BR>
Nor broke nor bruised the shield, by spell bested;<BR>
But his arm rang astounded by the blow;<BR>
Nor aught but Hector&#8217;s mail the sword had stopt,<BR>
Whose furious blow would his left arm have lopt;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
And had upon his head descended shear,<BR>
Whereat designed to strike the savage fair.<BR>
Scarce his left arm can good Rogero rear;<BR>
Can scarce the shield and blazoned bird upbear.<BR>
All pity he casts off, and &#8217;twould appear<BR>
As in his eyes a lighted torch did glare.<BR>
As hard as he can smite, he smites; and woe<BR>
To thee, Marphisa, if he plants the blow!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
I cannot tell you truly in what wise,<BR>
That faulchion swerves against a cypress-stock,<BR>
In such close-serried ranks the saplings rise,<BR>
Buried above a palm within the block.<BR>
As this the mountain and the plain that lies<BR>
Beneath it, with a furious earthquake rock;<BR>
And from that marble monument proceeds<BR>
A voice, that every mortal voice exceeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
The horrid voice exclaims, &#8220;Your quarrel leave;<BR>
For &#8217;twere a deed unjust and inhumane,<BR>
That brother should of life his sister reave,<BR>
Or sister by her brother&#8217;s hand be slain.<BR>
Rogero and Marphisa mine, believe!<BR>
The tale which I deliver is not vain.<BR>
Seed of one father, on one womb ye lay;<BR>
And first together saw the light of day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Galaciella&#8217;s children are ye, whom<BR>
She to Rogero, hight the second, bare.<BR>
Whose brothers, having, by unrighteous doom,<BR>
Of your unhappy sire deprived that fair,<BR>
Not heeding that she carried in her womb<BR>
Ye, who yet suckers of their lineage are,<BR>
Her in a rotten carcase of a boat,<BR>
To founder in mid ocean, set afloat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But Fortune, that had destined you whilere,<BR>
And yet unborn, to many a fair emprize,<BR>
Your mother to that lonely shore did steer,<BR>
Which overright the sandy Syrtes lies.<BR>
Where, having given you birth, that spirit dear<BR>
Forthwith ascended into Paradise.<BR>
A witness of the piteous case was I,<BR>
So Heaven had willed, and such your destiny!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I to the dame as descent burial gave<BR>
As could be given upon that desert sand.<BR>
Ye, well enveloped in my vest, I save,<BR>
And bear to Mount Carena from the strand;<BR>
And make a lioness leave whelps and cave,<BR>
And issue from the wood, with semblance bland.<BR>
Ye, twice ten months, with mickle fondness bred,<BR>
And from her paps the milky mother fed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Needing to quit my home upon a day,<BR>
And journey through the country, (as you can<BR>
Haply remember by an Arab clan.<BR>
Those robbers thee, Marphisa, bore away:<BR>
While young Rogero &#8217;scaped, who better ran.<BR>
Bereaved of thee, they woful loss I wept,<BR>
And with more watchful care thy brother kept.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Rogero, if Atlantes watched thee well,<BR>
While yet he was alive, thou best dost know.<BR>
I the fixed stars had heard of thee foretell,<BR>
That thou shouldst perish by a treacherous foe<BR>
In Christian land; and still their influence fell<BR>
Was ended, laboured to avert the blow;<BR>
Nor having power in fine thy will to guide,<BR>
I sickened sore, and of my sorrow died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But here, before my death, for in this glade<BR>
I knew thou should&#8217;st with bold Marphisa fight,<BR>
I with huge stones, amassed by hellish aid,<BR>
Had this fair monument of marble dight;<BR>
And I to Charon with loud outcries said;<BR>
I would not he should hence convey my sprite,<BR>
Till here, prepared in deadly fray to strive,<BR>
Rogero and his sister should arrive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thus has my spirit for this many a day<BR>
Waited thy coming in these beauteous groves;<BR>
So be no more to jealous fears a prey,<BR>
O Bradamant, because Rogero loves.<BR>
But me to quit the cheerful realms of day,<BR>
And seek the darksome cloisters it behoves.&#8221;<BR>
Here ceased the voice; which in the Child amazed<BR>
And those two damsels mighty marvel raised.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Gladly a sister in the martial queen<BR>
Rogero, she in him a brother knows;<BR>
Who now embrace, nor move her jealous spleen,<BR>
That with the love of young Rogero glows;<BR>
And citing what, and when, and where had been<BR>
Their childish deeds, as they to memory rose,<BR>
In summing up past times, more sure they hold<BR>
The things whereof the wizard&#8217;s spirit told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero from Marphisa does not hide,<BR>
How Bradamant to him at heart is dear;<BR>
And by what obligations he is tied<BR>
In moving words relates the cavalier;<BR>
Nor ceases till he has, on either side,<BR>
Turned to firm love the hate they bore whilere.<BR>
When, as a sign of peace, and discord chased,<BR>
They, at his bidding, tenderly embraced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Marphisa to Rogero makes request<BR>
To say what sire was theirs, and what their strain;<BR>
And how he died; by banded foes opprest,<BR>
Or at close barriers, was the warrior slain?<BR>
And who it was had issued the behest<BR>
To drown their mother in the stormy main?<BR>
For of the tale, if ever heard before,<BR>
Little or nothing she in memory bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of Trojan ancestors are we the seed,<BR>
Through famous Hector&#8217;s line,&#8221; (Rogero said,)<BR>
&#8220;For after young Astyanax was freed,<BR>
From fierce Ulysses and the toils he spread,<BR>
Leaving another stripling in his stead,<BR>
Of his own age, he out of Phrygia fled.<BR>
Who, after long and wide sea-wandering, gained<BR>
Sicily&#8217;s shore, and in Messina reigned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Part of Calabria within Faro held<BR>
The warrior&#8217;s heirs, who after a long run<BR>
Of successors, departed thence and dwelled<BR>
In Mars&#8217; imperial city: more than one<BR>
Famed king and emperor, who that list have swelled,<BR>
In Rome and other part has filled the throne;<BR>
And from Constantius and good Constantine,<BR>
Stretched to the son of Pepin, is their line.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Rogero, Gambaron, Buovo hence succeed;<BR>
And that Rogero, second of the name,<BR>
Who filled our fruitful mother with his seed;<BR>
As thou Atlantes may&#8217;st have heard proclaim.<BR>
Of our fair lineage many a noble deed<BR>
Shalt thou hear blazed abroad by sounding Fame.&#8221;<BR>
Of Agolant&#8217;s inroad next the stripling told,<BR>
With Agramant and with Almontes bold;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
And how a lovely daughter, who excelled<BR>
In feats of arms, that king accompanied;<BR>
So stout she many paladins had quelled;<BR>
And how, in fine, she for Rogero sighed;<BR>
And for his love against her sire rebelled;<BR>
And was baptized, and was Rogero&#8217;s bride;<BR>
And how a traitor loved (him Bertram name)<BR>
His brother&#8217;s wife with an incestuous flame;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
And country, sire, and brethren two betrayed,<BR>
Hoping he so the lady should have won;<BR>
How Risa open to the foe he laid,<BR>
By whom all scathe was on those kinsmen done;<BR>
How Agolant&#8217;s two furious sons conveyed<BR>
Their mother, great with child, and six months gone,<BR>
Aboard a helmless boat, and with its charge,<BR>
In wildest winter, turned adrift the barge.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Valiant Marphisa, with a tranquil face,<BR>
Heard young Rogero thus his tale pursue,<BR>
And joyed to be descended of a race<BR>
Which from so fair a font its waters drew:<BR>
Whence Clermont, whence renowned Mongrana trace<BR>
Their noble line, the martial damsel knew;<BR>
Blazoned through years and centuries by Fame,<BR>
Unrivalled, both, in arms of mighty name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
When afterwards she from her brother knew<BR>
Agramant&#8217;s uncle, sire, and grandsire fell,<BR>
In treacherous wise, the first Rogero slew<BR>
And brought to cruel pass Galacielle,<BR>
Marphisa could not hear the story through:<BR>
To him she cries, &#8220;With pardon, what you tell,<BR>
Brother, convicts you of too foul a wrong,<BR>
In leaving thus our sire unvenged so long.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Could&#8217;st thou not in Almontes and Troyane,<BR>
As dead whilere, your thirsty faulchion plant,<BR>
By you those monarch&#8217;s children might be slain.<BR>
Are you alive, and lives King Agramant?<BR>
Never will you efface the shameful stain,<BR>
That ye, so often wronged, not only grant<BR>
Life to that king, but as your lord obey;<BR>
Lodge in his court, and serve him for his pay?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Here heartily in face of Heaven I vow,<BR>
That Christ my father worshipped, to adore;<BR>
And till I venge my parents on the foe<BR>
To wear this armour, and I will deplore<BR>
Your deed, Rogero, and deplore even now,<BR>
That you should swell the squadrons of the Moor,<BR>
Or other follower of the Moslem faith,<BR>
Save sword in hand, and to the paynim&#8217;s scathe.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Ah! how fair Bradamant uplifts again<BR>
Her visage at that speech, rejoiced in sprite!<BR>
Rogero she exhorts in earnest vein<BR>
To do as his Marphisa counsels right;<BR>
And bids him seek the camp of Charlemagne,<BR>
And have himself acknowledged in his sight,<BR>
Who so reveres and lauds his father&#8217;s worth,<BR>
He even deems him one unmatched on earth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
In the beginning so he should have done,<BR>
(Warily young Rogero answer made,)<BR>
But, for the tale was not so fully known,<BR>
As since, the deed had been too long delaid.<BR>
Now, seeing it was fierce Troyano&#8217;s son<BR>
That had begirt him with the knightly blade,<BR>
He, as a traitor, well might be abhorred,<BR>
If he slew one, accepted as his lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
But, as to Bradamant whilere, he cries,<BR>
He will all measures and all means assay,<BR>
Whereby some fair occasion may arise<BR>
To leave the king; and had there been delay,<BR>
And he whilere had done in otherwise,<BR>
She on the Tartar king the fault must lay:<BR>
How sorely handled that redoubted foe<BR>
Had left him in their battle, she must know;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
And she, that every day had sought his bed,<BR>
Must of this truth the fittest witness be.<BR>
Much upon this was answered, much was said,<BR>
Between those damsels, who at last agree;<BR>
And as their last resolve, last counsel read,<BR>
He should rejoin the paynim&#8217;s ensignry,<BR>
Till he found fair occasion to resort<BR>
From Agramant&#8217;s to Charles&#8217;s royal court.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
To Bradamant the bold Marphisa cries:<BR>
&#8220;Let him begone, nor doubt am I, before<BR>
Many days pass, will manage in such wise,<BR>
That Agramant shall be his lord no more.&#8221;<BR>
So says the martial damsel, nor implies<BR>
The secret purpose which she has in store.<BR>
Making his congees to the friendly twain,<BR>
To join his king Rogero turns the rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
When a complaint is heard from valley near:<BR>
All now stand listening, to the noise attent;<BR>
And to that plaintive voice incline their ear,<BR>
A woman&#8217;s (as &#8217;twould seem) that makes lament.<BR>
But I this strain would gladly finish here,<BR>
And, that I finish it, be ye content:<BR>
For better things I promise to report,<BR>
If ye to hear another strain resort.</TD></TR>
