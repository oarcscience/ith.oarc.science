<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Zerbino for Gabrina, who a heart<BR>
Of asp appears to bear, contends. O&#8217;erthrown,<BR>
The Fleming falls upon the other part,<BR>
Through cause of that despised and odious crone,<BR>
He wounded sore, and writhing with the smart,<BR>
The beldam&#8217;s treason to the prince makes known,<BR>
Whose scorn and hatred hence derive new force.<BR>
Towards loud cries Zerbino spurs his horse.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
No cord I well believe is wound so tight<BR>
Round chest, nor nails the plank so fastly hold,<BR>
As Faith enwraps an honourable sprite<BR>
In its secure, inextricable, fold;<BR>
Nor holy Faith, it seems, except in white<BR>
Was mantled over in the days of old;<BR>
So by the ancient limner ever painted,<BR>
As by one speck, one single blemish tainted.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Faith should be kept unbroken evermore,<BR>
With one or with a thousand men united;<BR>
As well if given in grot or forest hoar,<BR>
Remote from town and hamlet, as if plighted<BR>
Amid a crowd of witnesses, before<BR>
Tribunal, and in act and deed recited:<BR>
Nor needs the solemn sanction of an oath:<BR>
It is sufficient that we pledge our troth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
And this maintains as it maintained should be,<BR>
In each emprize the Scottish cavalier,<BR>
And gives good proof of his fidelity,<BR>
Quitting his road with that old crone to steer;<BR>
Although this breeds the youth such misery,<BR>
As &#8217;twould to have Disease itself as near,<BR>
Or even Death; but with him heavier weighed<BR>
That his desire the promise he had made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Of him I told who felt at heart such load,<BR>
Reflecting she beneath his charge must go,<BR>
He spake no word; and thus in silent mode<BR>
Both fared: so sullen was Zerbino&#8217;s woe.<BR>
I said how vexed their silence, as they rode,<BR>
Was broke, when Sol his hindmost wheels did show,<BR>
By an adventurous errant cavalier,<BR>
Who in mid pathway met the crone and peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The hag, who the approaching warrior knew,<BR>
(Hermonides of Holland he was hight)<BR>
That bore upon a field of sable hue<BR>
A bar of vermeil tint, transversely dight,<BR>
Did humbly now to good Zerbino sue,<BR>
&#8212;Her pride abased, and look of haught despite&#8212;<BR>
And him reminded of the promise made,<BR>
When her Marphisa to his care conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Because as foe to her and hers she knew<BR>
The knight they were encountering, who had slain<BR>
Her only brother and her father true;<BR>
And was advised, the traitor would be fain<BR>
By her, the remnant of her race, to do<BR>
What he had perpetrated on the twain.<BR>
&#8220;Woman, while guarded by my arm (he said)<BR>
I will not thou shouldst any danger dread.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
As nearer now, the stranger knight espied<BR>
That face, which was so hateful in his sight,<BR>
With menacing and savage voice he cried,<BR>
&#8220;Either with me prepare thyself to fight,<BR>
Or arm thee not on that old woman&#8217;s side,<BR>
Who by my hand shall perish, as is right.<BR>
If thou contendest for her, thou art slain;<BR>
For such their portion is who wrong maintain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Him young Zerbino answered courteously,<BR>
Twas sign of evil and ungenerous will,<BR>
And corresponded not with chivalry,<BR>
That he a woman should desire to kill;<BR>
Yet if the knight persists, he will not flee&#8212;<BR>
But bids him well consider first how ill<BR>
&#8217;Twould sound, that he, a gentle knight and good,<BR>
Should wish to dip his hand in woman&#8217;s blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
This and yet more he vainly says; nor stand<BR>
They idle long; from word they pass to deed;<BR>
And having compassed on the level land<BR>
Enough of ground, encounter on the mead.<BR>
Not fired in some rejoicing, from the hand<BR>
Discharged, so fast the whistling rockets speed,<BR>
As the two coursers bear the cavaliers<BR>
To hurtle in mid space with rested spears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Hermonides of Holland levelled low,<BR>
And for the youth&#8217;s left flank the stroke intended;<BR>
But his weak lance was shivered by the blow,<BR>
And little the opposing Scot offended:<BR>
But vain was not the spear-thrust of his foe,<BR>
Who bored his opposite&#8217;s good shield, and rended<BR>
His shoulder, by the lance pierced through and through,<BR>
And good Hermonides on earth o&#8217;erthrew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Thinking him slain who only lay amazed,<BR>
By pity prest, Zerbino leapt to ground,<BR>
And from his deathlike face the vizor raised;<BR>
And he, as wakened out of sleep profound,<BR>
In silence, hard upon Zerbino gazed;<BR>
Then cried, &#8220;It does not me, in truth, confound,<BR>
To think that I am overthrown by thee,<BR>
Who seem&#8217;st the flower of errant chivalry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But it with reason grieves me this is done<BR>
Upon account of a false woman&#8217;s spite;<BR>
Whose wicked cause I know not why you own,<BR>
An office ill according with your might:<BR>
And when to you the occasion shall be known<BR>
Which urges me her wickedness to quite,<BR>
Whene&#8217;er you think on it, you will repent<BR>
How she by you was saved, and I was shent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if enough of breath, although I fear<BR>
The contrary, is left me to expound<BR>
Her evil actions, I shall make appear<BR>
She in all guilt transgresses every bound.<BR>
I had a brother once: the youthful peer<BR>
Set out from Holland&#8217;s isle, our natal ground,<BR>
To serve Heraclius, &#8217;mid his knights arrayed,<BR>
Who then the Grecian empire&#8217;s sceptre swayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Brother in arms and bosom-friend installed<BR>
Here was he by a baron of that court,<BR>
Who, in a pleasant site, and strongly walled,<BR>
On Servia&#8217;s distant frontier had a fort.<BR>
Argaeus he of whom I tell was called,<BR>
Husband of that ill hag, whom in such sort<BR>
He loved, as passed all mean, and misbecame<BR>
One of his worth and honourable fame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But she, more volatile than leaf, when breeze<BR>
Of autumn most its natural moisture dries,<BR>
And strips the fluttering foliage from the trees,<BR>
Which, blown about, before its fury flies,<BR>
Changes her humour, and her husband sees,<BR>
Whom she some time had loved, with other eyes,<BR>
And in her every wish and every thought<BR>
Schemes how my brother&#8217;s love may best be bought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But not Acroceraunus fronts the brine,<BR>
&#8212;Ill-famed&#8212;against whose base the billow heaves,<BR>
Nor against Boreas stands the mountain pine,<BR>
That has a hundred times renewed its leaves,<BR>
And towering high on Alp or Apennine,<BR>
With its fast root the rock as deeply cleaves,<BR>
So firmly as the youth resists the will<BR>
Of that foul woman, sink of every ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Now, as it oft befalls a cavalier<BR>
Who seeks and finds adventure, high and low,<BR>
It happened that my gentle brother near<BR>
His comrade&#8217;s fort was wounded by a foe;<BR>
Where often, uninvited by the peer,<BR>
He guested, was his host with him or no;<BR>
And thither he resorted from the field,<BR>
There to repose until his wounds were healed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;While there he wounded lay, upon some need<BR>
It chanced Argaeus was compelled to ride.<BR>
Quickly that wanton, from his presence freed,<BR>
As was her use, my brother&#8217;s fealty tried.<BR>
But he, as one unstained in thought and deed,<BR>
So fell a goad no longer would abide;<BR>
And to preserve his faith, as lures increased,<BR>
Of many evils chose what seemed the least.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To break communion with the cavalier,<BR>
To him&#8212;of many&#8212;seemed the lightest ill,<BR>
And go so far, that wanton should not hear<BR>
More of his name: this purpose to fulfil<BR>
Was honester (though quitting one so dear<BR>
Was hard) than to content her evil will,<BR>
Of her foul wishes to her lord impart,<BR>
Who cherished her as fondly as his heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And though yet smarting with his wounds and pined,<BR>
He dons his arms, and from the tower departs;<BR>
And wanders thence with firm and constant mind,<BR>
Ne&#8217;er to return again into those parts.<BR>
But nought availed the purpose he designed;<BR>
His projects Fortune baffled with new arts.<BR>
This while, behold! the castellain returned,<BR>
And bathed in bitter tears the wife discerned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And with flushed face, and hair in disarray,<BR>
He asks of her what had disturbed her mood;<BR>
Who, ere she in reply a word will say,<BR>
Is vainly more than once to answer wooed;<BR>
And all the while is thinking in what way<BR>
The knight can best with vengeance be pursued.<BR>
And well it suited with her fickle vein,<BR>
Lightly to change her love into disdain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Ah! why should I conceal (in fine she cried)<BR>
The fault committed while you were away?<BR>
For though I it from all the world should hide,<BR>
This would my conscience to myself bewray.<BR>
The soul, which is with secret evil dyed,<BR>
Does with such penitence its fault appay,<BR>
As every corporal sufferance exceeds<BR>
That thou couldst deal me for my evil deeds;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;If evil be the deed, when done parforce.<BR>
But, be it what it may, the mischief know;<BR>
Then, with my sword from this polluted corse,<BR>
Delivered, let my spotless spirit go;<BR>
And quench these wretched eyes, which in remorse,<BR>
I, if I lived, on earth must ever throw,<BR>
As the least penance of so foul a blame,<BR>
And, look on whom they may, must blush for shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;My honour has been ruined by thy mate,<BR>
Who to this body violence has done,<BR>
And fearing lest I all to thee relate,<BR>
Without farewell the graceless churl is gone.&#8217;<BR>
She by this story made her husband hate<BR>
The youth, than whom before was dearer none.<BR>
Argaeus credits all, without delay<BR>
Arms him, and, breathing vengeance, posts away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In knowledge of that country not to seek,<BR>
He overtook the knight in little space;<BR>
For my poor brother, yet diseased and weak,<BR>
Rode, unsuspicious, at an easy pace;<BR>
Argaeus, eager his revenge to wreak,<BR>
Assailed him straight in a sequestered place.<BR>
My brother would excuse him if he might,<BR>
But his indignant host insists on fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This one was sound and full of new disdain,<BR>
That weak and friendly, as aye wont to be:<BR>
My brother was ill fitted to sustain<BR>
His altered comrade&#8217;s new-born enmity.<BR>
Philander, then unmeriting such pain,<BR>
(So was the stripling named, described by me)<BR>
Not gifted with the power to undergo<BR>
Such fierce assault, was taken by the foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Forbid it, Heaven! I should be led astray<BR>
So by just wrath and thy iniquity,<BR>
(To him Argaeus cried) as thee to slay,<BR>
Who loved thee once, and certes thou lovedst me,<BR>
Though in the end thou ill didst this display,<BR>
I yet desire this ample world may see<BR>
That, measured by my deeds, I rank above<BR>
Thyself in hate as highly as in love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;In other mode shall I chastise the deed,<BR>
Than spilling more of thine ill blood.&#8217; The peer,<BR>
This said, commands his followers, on a steed,<BR>
Of verdant boughs composed to place a bier,<BR>
And with the knight half-lifeless homeward speed,<BR>
And in a tower enclose the cavalier;<BR>
There dooms the guiltless stripling to remain,<BR>
And suffer prisonment&#8217;s perpetual pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet nothing but his former liberty<BR>
Thence to depart was wanting to the knight;<BR>
In all the rest, as one at large and free,<BR>
He ordered, and was still obeyed aright.<BR>
But that ill dame her former phantasy<BR>
Pursuing ever with unwearied sprite,<BR>
Having the keys, repaired nigh every day<BR>
To the close turret where the prisoner lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And evermore my brother she assailed,<BR>
And with more boldness prest her former suit.<BR>
&#8216;Mark what to thee fidelity availed!&#8217;<BR>
(She cries) &#8216;which all mere perfidy repute.<BR>
With what triumphant joy shalt thou be hailed!<BR>
What noble spoils are thine, what happy fruit!<BR>
Oh what a worthy guerdon is thy meed!<BR>
Branded by all men for a traitor&#8217;s deed!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;How well thou mightst have given, and without stain<BR>
Of thine own honour, what I sought of thee!<BR>
Now of so rigorous mood the worthy gain<BR>
Have and enjoy. In close captivity<BR>
Thou art; nor ever hope to break thy chain,<BR>
Unless thou soften thy obduracy.<BR>
But, if compliant, I a mean can frame<BR>
To render thee thy liberty and fame.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;No, no; have thou no hope,&#8217; (replied the knight,)<BR>
&#8216;That my true faith shall ever change, although<BR>
It thus should happen that, against all right,<BR>
I should so hard a sentence undergo.<BR>
Let the world blame. Enough that in HIS sight<BR>
&#8212;Who sees and judges every thing below,<BR>
And in HIS grace divine my fame can clear&#8212;<BR>
My innocence unsullied shall appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Does not Argaeus deem enough to sty<BR>
Me in his prison, let him take away<BR>
This noisome life. Nor yet may Heaven deny<BR>
Its meed, though ill the world my work appay.<BR>
And yet he who condemns me may, when I<BR>
Am parted from this tenement of clay,<BR>
Perceive that he has wronged me in the end,<BR>
And shall bewail when dead his faithful friend.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thus oftentimes that shameless woman prest<BR>
The good Philander, but obtained no fruit.<BR>
Nursing her blind desires, which knew not rest<BR>
In seeking what her wicked love may boot,<BR>
She her old vices, in her inmost breast,<BR>
Ransacks for what may best the occasion suit,<BR>
And sifts them all: then, having overrun<BR>
A thousand evil thoughts, resolved on one.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Six months she waited ere again she sought<BR>
The prisoner&#8217;s tower, as she was wont before:<BR>
From which the sad Philander hoped and thought<BR>
That love to him the dame no longer bore.<BR>
Lo! Fortune for her an occasion wrought,<BR>
(To evil deed propitious evermore)<BR>
To give effect, with memorable ill,<BR>
To her irrational and evil will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The husband had an ancient feud with one<BR>
Who was by name Morando hight the fair;<BR>
Who even within the fort would often run<BR>
In its lord&#8217;s absence; but the knight&#8217;s repair<BR>
At the wide distance of ten miles would shun,<BR>
Was he assured the castellain was there:<BR>
Who now, to lure him thither, bruited how<BR>
He for Jerusalem was bound by vow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Said he would go; and went. Thus each who spies<BR>
His outset, of his journey spreads the fame:<BR>
Nor he, who only on his wife relies,<BR>
Trusts any with his purpose but the dame,<BR>
And home returned when dusky waxed the skies;<BR>
Nor ever, save at evening, thither came;<BR>
And with changed ensigns, at the dawn of day,<BR>
Unseen of any, always went his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He now on this side, now on the other side,<BR>
Roved round his castle but to ascertain<BR>
If credulous Morando, who to ride<BR>
Thither was wonted, would return again.<BR>
All day he in the forest used to hide,<BR>
And, when he saw the sun beneath the main,<BR>
Came to the tower, and, through a secret gate,<BR>
Was there admitted by his faithless mate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thus every one, except his consort ill,<BR>
Argaeus many miles away suppose:<BR>
She, when &#8217;tis time her errand to fulfil,<BR>
Hatching new mischief, to my brother goes.<BR>
Of tears she has a ready shower at will,<BR>
Which from her eyes into her bosom flows,<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;Where shall I succour find, now needed most,<BR>
So that my honour be not wholly lost,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And, with my own, my wedded lord&#8217;s?&#8217; (she cries;)<BR>
&#8216;I should feel no alarm, if he were here.<BR>
Thou knowst Morando, know if deities<BR>
Or men he in Argaeus&#8217; absence fear.<BR>
He at this time tries all extremities;<BR>
Nor servant have I but by threat or prayer<BR>
He him to further his desire has swayed;<BR>
Nor know I whither to recur for aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Of my lord&#8217;s absence hearing the report,<BR>
And that he would not quickly homeward fare,<BR>
He had the insolence within my court,<BR>
Upon no other pretext to repair;<BR>
Who, were my absent lord within his fort,<BR>
So bold a deer not only would not dare,<BR>
But would not deem himself secure withal,<BR>
By Heaven! at three miles&#8217; distance from his wall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And what he erst by messenger had sought,<BR>
From me to-day has sued for face to face;<BR>
And in such manner that long time I thought<BR>
Dishonour must have followed and disgrace;<BR>
And if I had not humbly him besought,<BR>
And feigned to yield to him with ready grace,<BR>
He haply would have ravished that by force,<BR>
Which he expects to win by milder course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I promise, not designing to comply,<BR>
For void is contract made in fear; alone<BR>
From his ill purpose would I put him by,<BR>
And what he then parforce would else have done.<BR>
So stands the case: the single remedy<BR>
Lies in yourself: my honour else is gone,<BR>
And that of my Argaeus; which as dear,<BR>
Or more so, than your own you vowed whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;If you refuse me, I shall say, you show<BR>
That you have not the faith which you pretended,<BR>
But that in cruelty you said me no,<BR>
When vainly were my tears on you expended,<BR>
And no wise for Argaeus&#8217; sake, although<BR>
With this pretext you have yourself defended.<BR>
Our loves bad been concealed and free from blame;<BR>
But here I stand exposed to certain shame.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;To me such preface needs not (said anew<BR>
The good Philander), bound by amity<BR>
To my Argaeus still; thy pleasure shew:<BR>
I what I ever was will be, and I,<BR>
Although from him I bear such ill undue,<BR>
Accuse him not; for him would I defy<BR>
Even death itself; and let the world, allied<BR>
With my ill destiny, against me side!&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The impious woman answered, &#8217; &#8217;Tis my will<BR>
Thou slay him who would do us foul despite;<BR>
Nor apprehend to encounter any ill:<BR>
For I the certain mean will tell aright.<BR>
He will return, his purpose to fulfil,<BR>
At the third hour, when darkest is the night;<BR>
And, at a preconcerted signal made,<BR>
Be without noise by me within conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Let it not irk thee to await the peer<BR>
Within my chamber, where no light will be;<BR>
Till I shall make him doff his warlike gear,<BR>
And, almost naked, yield him up to thee.&#8217;<BR>
So did his wife into that quicksand steer<BR>
Her hapless husband (it appears to me)<BR>
If wife she rightly could be called; more fell<BR>
And cruel than a fury sprung from hell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She drew my brother forth, that guilty night,<BR>
With his good arms in hand, and him again<BR>
Secreted in the chamber without light,<BR>
Till thither came the wretched castellain.<BR>
As it was ordered, all fell out aright,<BR>
For seldom ill design is schemed in vain.<BR>
So fell Argaeus by Philander&#8217;s sword,<BR>
Who for Morando took the castle&#8217;s lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;One blow divided head and neck; for nought<BR>
Was there of helm, the warrior to defend.<BR>
Without a struggle was Argaeus brought<BR>
To his unhappy life&#8217;s disastrous end,<BR>
And he who slew him never had such thought,<BR>
Nor this would have believed: to aid his friend<BR>
Intent, (strange chance!) he wrought him in that blow<BR>
The worst that could be done by mortal foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When now, unknown, on earth Argaeus lay,<BR>
My brother to Gabrina gave the blade,<BR>
(So was she named) who lived but to betray.<BR>
She, who discovery had till then delayed,<BR>
Wills that Philander with a light survey<BR>
The man whom he on earth has lifeless laid,<BR>
And she, with the assistance of the light,<BR>
Shows him Argaeus in the murdered wight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And threatens, save he with desires comply<BR>
To which her bosom had been long a prey,<BR>
What he would be unable to deny<BR>
She to the assembled household will display,<BR>
And he like traitor and assassin die,<BR>
Upon her tale, in ignominious way:<BR>
And minds him fame is not to be despised,<BR>
Albeit so little life by him be prized.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Philander stood oppressed with grief and fear,<BR>
When his mistake to him the woman showed,<BR>
And to have slain her in his wrath went near,<BR>
And long be doubted, so his choler glowed;<BR>
And, but that Reason whispered in his ear<BR>
That he was in an enemy&#8217;s abode,<BR>
For lack of faulchion in his empty sheath,<BR>
He would have torn her piece-meal with his teeth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As sometimes vessel by two winds which blow<BR>
From different points is vext upon the main,<BR>
And now one speeds the bark an-end, and now<BR>
Another squall impels her back again;<BR>
Still on her poop assailed, or on her prow,<BR>
Till she before the strongest flies amain:<BR>
Philander, so distraught by two designs,<BR>
Takes what he pregnant with least ill opines.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Reason demonstrates with what peril fraught<BR>
His case, not more with death than lasting stain,<BR>
If in the castle were that murder taught;<BR>
Nor any time has he to sift his brain.<BR>
Will he or nill he, in conclusion nought<BR>
Is left him but the bitter cup to drain.<BR>
Thus in his troubled heart prevailing more,<BR>
His fear his resolution overbore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The fear of shameful punishment&#8217;s pursuit<BR>
Made him with many protestations swear<BR>
To grant in every thing Gabrina&#8217;s suit,<BR>
If from the fortilage they safely fare.<BR>
So plucks that impious dame, parforce, the fruit<BR>
Of her desires, and thence retreat the pair.<BR>
Thus home again the young Philander came,<BR>
Leaving behind him a polluted name;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And deeply graven in his bosom bore<BR>
The image of his friend so rashly slain;<BR>
By this to purchase, to his torment sore,<BR>
A Progne, a Medea; impious gain!<BR>
&#8212;And but his knightly faith, and oaths he swore,<BR>
Were to his fury as a curbing rein,<BR>
From him when safe she would have met her fate;<BR>
But lived subjected to his bitterest hate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thenceforth he nevermore was seen to smile:<BR>
All his discourse was sad, and still ensued<BR>
Sobs from his breast; afflicted in the style<BR>
Of vext Orestes, when he in his mood<BR>
Had slain his mother and Aegysthus vile;<BR>
By vengeful furies for the deed pursued.<BR>
Till broken by the ceaseless grief he fed,<BR>
He sickened and betook himself to bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Now in the harlot, when she had discerned<BR>
This other set by her so little store,<BR>
The former amorous flame was quickly turned<BR>
Into despiteous rage and hatred sore;<BR>
Nor with less wrath she towards my brother burned<BR>
Than for Argaeus she had felt before;<BR>
And she disposed herself, in treasons versed,<BR>
To slay her second husband like the first.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of a deceitful leech she made assay,<BR>
Well fitted for the work she had in hand,<BR>
Who better knew what deadly poisons slay<BR>
Than he the force of healing syrup scanned;<BR>
And promised him his service to repay<BR>
With a reward exceeding his demand,<BR>
When he should, with some drink of deadly might,<BR>
Of her detested husband rid her sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In presence of myself and more beside,<BR>
The wicked elder, with his deadly dole,<BR>
Approaching my unhappy brother, cried,<BR>
&#8216;It was a sovereign drink to make him whole.&#8217;<BR>
But here a new device Gabrina tried,<BR>
And, ere the sickly man could taste the bowl,<BR>
To rid her of accomplice in the deed,<BR>
Or to defraud him of his promised meed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Seized on his hand, the instant he presented<BR>
The poison to my brother. &#8216;Ill my fear,<BR>
(Exclaimed the dame) by you would be resented,<BR>
Excited for a spouse I hold so dear.<BR>
I, that the beverage has not been fermented<BR>
With evil drug and poisonous, will be clear;<BR>
Nor deem it meet that you to him convey<BR>
The proffered bowl, unless you take the say.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In what condition think you, sir, remained<BR>
The wretched elder by his fears opprest?<BR>
Thus by the woman&#8217;s suddenness constrained,<BR>
He had no time for thinking what were best.<BR>
He, lest more doubt of him be entertained,<BR>
Tastes of the chalice, at Gabrina&#8217;s hest;<BR>
And the sick man, emboldened so, drinks up<BR>
All the remainder of the poisoned cup.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As the trained hawk of crooked talon who<BR>
Clutches the partridge, when about to eat,<BR>
Is by the dog, she deems her comrade true,<BR>
O&#8217;ertaken and defrauded of the meat;<BR>
So on ill gain intent, the leech, in lieu<BR>
Of the expected aid, received defeat.<BR>
Hear, thus, what sovereign wickedness will dare,<BR>
And be like fate each greedy miscreant&#8217;s share!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This past and done, the leech would homeward speed,<BR>
That he, to counteract the pest he bore<BR>
Within his bowels, in this fearful need,<BR>
Might use some secret of his cunning lore;<BR>
But this the wicked dame would not concede,<BR>
Forbidding him to issue thence before<BR>
His patient&#8217;s stomach should the juice digest,<BR>
And its restoring power be manifest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No prayer will move, nor offered price will buy<BR>
The woman&#8217;s leave to let him thence depart.<BR>
The desperate man who saw that death was nigh,<BR>
And sure to follow, quickly changed his part;<BR>
And told the story to the standers-by;<BR>
Nor could she cover it with all her art.<BR>
Thus what he wont to do by many a one,<BR>
That goodly doctor by himself has done;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And follows with his soul my brother true,<BR>
That hence, already freed, was gone before.<BR>
We, the assistants, that the matter knew<BR>
From the old man who lingered little more,<BR>
Took that abominable monster, who<BR>
More cruel was than beast in forest hoar,<BR>
And, prisoned in a darksome place, reserved<BR>
To perish in the fire, as she deserved.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
So said Hermonides, and had pursued<BR>
His tale, and told how she from prison fled;<BR>
But suffered from his wound a pang so shrewd,<BR>
He fell reversed upon his grassy bed.<BR>
Meanwhile two squires, who served him in the wood,<BR>
A rustic bier of sturdy branches spread.<BR>
Their master upon this the servants lay,<BR>
Who could not thence be borne in other way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Zerbino, in excuse, assured the peer,<BR>
He grieved so good a knight to have offended;<BR>
But, as was still the use of cavalier,<BR>
Had guarded her who in his guidance wended;<BR>
Nor had he else preserved his honour clear:<BR>
For when the dame was to his care commended,<BR>
Her to defend his promise he had plight<BR>
From all men, to the utmost of his might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
He, if he might, is any thing beside,<BR>
Would readily assist him in his need.<BR>
&#8212;His only wish, (the cavalier replied,)<BR>
Was, he might be from ill Gabrina freed,<BR>
Ere him some mighty mischief should betide,<BR>
Of future penitence the bitter seed.<BR>
Gabrina keeps on earth her downcast eye;<BR>
For ill the simple truth admits reply.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Zerbino thence, upon the promised way,<BR>
With the old woman in his escort, went,<BR>
And inly cursed her all the livelong day,<BR>
That in her cause that baron he had shent.<BR>
And having heard the knight her guilt display,<BR>
Who was instructed in her evil bent,<BR>
He&#8212;if before he had her at despite&#8212;<BR>
So loathed her, she was poison to his sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Well read in young Zerbino&#8217;s hate, the dame<BR>
Would not by him in malice be outdone,<BR>
Nor bated him an inch, but in that game<BR>
Of deadly hatred set him two for one.<BR>
Her face was with the venom in a flame<BR>
Wherewith her swelling bosom overrun.<BR>
&#8217;Twas thus in such concord as I say,<BR>
These through the ancient wood pursued their way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
When, lo! as it is now nigh eventide,<BR>
They a mixt sound of blows and outcries hear,<BR>
Which seem a sign of battle fiercely plied,<BR>
And (as the deafening noise demonstrates) near.<BR>
To mark what this might be, towards that side<BR>
Whence came the tumult, moved the Scottish peer;<BR>
Nor is in following him Gabrina slow:<BR>
What chanced in other canto you shall know.</TD></TR>
