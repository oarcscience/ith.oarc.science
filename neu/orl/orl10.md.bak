Feared lest the buckler’s light should be impaired,<br />

Defended, which had him already snared.<br />

Which works as it was wont in other time.<br />
As trout or grayling to the bottom goes<br />
In stream, which mountaineer disturbs with lime;<br />

The orc, reversed among the foam and slime.<br />

Still beats, but cannot find the way to wound.</td>

Still weeping) “ere the orc awake again.<br />
Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way.<br />

Untied the maid, and raised her from the shore.</td>

Proposed, for compassing the whole of Spain:<br />
But stopt his courser on the neighbouring shore<br />
Where lesser Britain runs into the main.<br />
Upon the bank there rose an oakwood hoar,<br />
Where Philomel for ever seemed to plain;<br />
I’ the middle was a meadow with a fountain,<br />
And, at each end, a solitary mountain.</td>

And dropping in the meadow, made his steed<br />
Furl, yet not shut so close, his wings again,<br />
As he had spread them wide for better speed.<br />
Down lights Rogero, and forbears with pain<br />
From other leap; but this his arms impede:<br />
His arms impede; a bar to his desire,<br />
And he must doff them would he slake the fire.</td>

Rogero did his shining arms undo:<br />
Never the task appeared to him so long;<br />
For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two.<br />
But, sir, too long continued is this song,<br />
And haply may as well have wearied you;<br />
So that I shall delay to other time,<br />
When it may better please, my tedious rhyme.</td>
