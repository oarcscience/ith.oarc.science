Rogero flies; Astolpho with the rest,<BR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
H<SMALL>OW</SMALL> many enchantresses among us! oh,<BR>
How many enchanters are there, though unknown!<BR>
Who for their love make man or woman glow,<BR>
Changing them into figures not their own.<BR>
Nor this by help of spirits from below,<BR>
Nor observation of the stars is done:<BR>
But these on hearts with fraud and falsehood plot,<BR>
Binding them with indissoluble knot.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Who with Angelica&#8217;s, or rather who<BR>
Were fortified with Reason&#8217;s ring, would see<BR>
Each countenance, exposed to open view,<BR>
Unchanged by art or by hypocrisy.<BR>
This now seems fair and good, whose borrowed hue<BR>
Removed, would haply foul and evil be.<BR>
Well was it for Rogero that he wore<BR>
The virtuous ring which served the truth to explore!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Rogero, still dissembling, as I said,<BR>
Armed, to the gate on Rabican did ride;<BR>
Found the guard unprepared, not let his blade,<BR>
Amid that crowd, hang idle at his side:<BR>
He passed the bridge, and broke the palisade,<BR>
Some slain, some maimed; then t&#8217;wards the forest hied;<BR>
But on that road small space had measured yet,<BR>
When he a servant of the fairy met.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
He on his fist a ravening falcon bore,<BR>
Which he made fly for pastime every day;<BR>
Now on the champaign, now upon the shore<BR>
Of neighbouring pool, which teemed with certain prey;<BR>
And rode a hack which simple housings wore,<BR>
His faithful dog, companion of his way.<BR>
He, marking well the haste with which he hies,<BR>
Conjectures truly what Rogero flies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Towards him came the knave, with semblance haught,<BR>
Demanding whither in such haste he sped:<BR>
To him the good Rogero answers naught.<BR>
He hence assured more clearly that he fled,<BR>
Within himself to stop the warrior thought,<BR>
And thus, with his left arm extended, said:<BR>
&#8220;What, if I suddenly thy purpose balk,<BR>
And thou find no defence against this hawk?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Then flies his bird, who works so well his wing,<BR>
Rabican cannot distance him in flight:<BR>
The falconer from his back to ground did spring,<BR>
And freed him from the bit which held him tight;<BR>
Who seemed an arrow parted from the string,<BR>
And terrible to foe, with kick and bite;<BR>
While with such haste behind the servant came,<BR>
He sped as moved by wind, or rather flame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Nor will the falconer&#8217;s dog appear more slow;<BR>
But hunts Rogero&#8217;s courser, as in chace<BR>
Of timid hare the pard is wont to go.<BR>
Not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace,<BR>
And turns towards the swiftly-footed foe,<BR>
Whom he sees wield a riding-wand, place<BR>
Of other arms, to make his dog obey.<BR>
Rogero scorns his faulchion to display.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
The servant made at him, and smote him sore;<BR>
The dog his left foot worried; while untied<BR>
From rein, the lightened horse three times and more<BR>
Lashed from the croup, nor missed his better side.<BR>
The hawk, oft wheeling, with her talons tore<BR>
The stripling, and his horse so terrified,<BR>
The courser, by the whizzing sound dismayed,<BR>
Little the guiding hand or spur obeyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Constrained at length, his sword Rogero drew<BR>
To clear the rabble, who his course delay;<BR>
And in the animals&#8217; or villain&#8217;s view<BR>
Did now its point, and now its edge display.<BR>
But with more hinderance and vexatious crew<BR>
Swarm here and there, and wholly block the way;<BR>
And that dishonour will ensue and loss,<BR>
Rogero sees, if him they longer cross.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
He knew each little that he longer stayed,<BR>
Would bring the fay and followers on the trail;<BR>
Already drums were beat, and trumpets brayed,<BR>
And larum-bells rang loud in every vale.<BR>
An act too foul it seemed to use his blade<BR>
On dog, and knave unfenced with arms or mail:<BR>
A better and shorter way it were<BR>
The buckler, old Atlantes&#8217; work, to bare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
He raised the crimson cloth in which he wore<BR>
The wondrous shield, enclosed for many a day;<BR>
Its beams, as proved a thousand times before,<BR>
Work as they wont, when on the sight they play;<BR>
Senseless the falconer tumbles on the moor;<BR>
Drop dog and hackney; drop the pinions gay,<BR>
Which poised in air the bird no longer keep:<BR>
Then glad Rogero leaves a prey to sleep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
In the mean time, Alcina, who had heard<BR>
How he had forced the gate, and, in the press,<BR>
Slaughtered a mighty number of her guard,<BR>
Remained nigh dead, o&#8217;erwhelmed with her distress:<BR>
She tore her vesture, and her visage marred,<BR>
And cursed her want of wit and wariness.<BR>
Then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms,<BR>
And round herself arrayed her martial swarms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Divided next, one squadron by the way<BR>
Rogero took, she sent; the bands were two:<BR>
She at the port embarked the next array,<BR>
And straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew.<BR>
With this good squadron went the desperate fay,<BR>
And darked by loosened sails the billows grew;<BR>
For so desire upon her bosom preyed,<BR>
Of troops she left her city unpurveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Without a guard she left her palace there,<BR>
Which to Melissa, prompt her time to seize,<BR>
To loose her vassals that in misery were,<BR>
Afforded all convenience and full ease;<BR>
&#8212;To range, at leisure, through the palace fair,<BR>
And so examine all her witcheries;<BR>
To raze the seal, burn images, and loose<BR>
Or cancel hag-knot, rhomb, or magic noose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Thence, through the fields, fast hurrying from that dome,<BR>
The former lovers changed, a mighty train,<BR>
Some into rock or tree, to fountain some,<BR>
Or beast, she made assume their shapes again:<BR>
And these, when they anew are free to roam,<BR>
Follow Rogero&#8217;s footsteps to the reign<BR>
Of Logistilla&#8217;s sage; and from that bourn<BR>
To Scythia, Persia, Greece, and Ind return.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
They to their several homes dispatched, repair,<BR>
Bound by a debt which never can be paid:<BR>
The English duke, above the rest her care,<BR>
Of these, was first in human form arrayed:<BR>
For much his kindred and the courteous prayer<BR>
Of good Rogero with Melissa weighed.<BR>
Beside his prayers, the ring Rogero gave;<BR>
That him she by its aid might better save.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Thus by Rogero&#8217;s suit the enchantress won,<BR>
To his first shape transformed the youthful peer;<BR>
But good Melissa deemed that nought was done<BR>
Save she restored his armour, and that spear<BR>
Of gold, which whensoe&#8217;er at tilt he run,<BR>
At the first touch unseated cavalier;<BR>
Once Argal&igrave;a&#8217;s, next Astolpho&#8217;s lance,<BR>
And source of mighty fame to both in France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The sage Melissa found this spear of gold,<BR>
Which now Alcina&#8217;s magic palace graced,<BR>
And other armour of the warrior bold,<BR>
Of which he was in that ill dome uncased.<BR>
She climbed the courser of the wizard old,<BR>
And on the croup, at ease, Astolpho placed:<BR>
And thus, an hour before Rogero came,<BR>
Repaired to Logistilla, knight and dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Meantime, through rugged rocks, and shagged with thorn,<BR>
Rogero wends, to seek the sober fay;<BR>
From cliff to cliff, from path to path forlorn,<BR>
A rugged, lone, inhospitable way:<BR>
Till he, with labour huge oppressed and worn,<BR>
Issued at noon upon a beach, that lay<BR>
&#8217;Twixt sea and mountain, open to the south,<BR>
Deserted, barren, bare, and parched with drouth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
The sunbeams on the neighbouring mountain beat<BR>
And glare, reflected from the glowing mass<BR>
So fiercely, sand and air both boil with heat,<BR>
In mode that might have more than melted glass.<BR>
The birds are silent in their dim retreat,<BR>
Nor any note is heard in wood or grass,<BR>
Save the bough-perched Cicala&#8217;s wearying cry,<BR>
Which deafens hill and dale, and sea and sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
The heat and thirst and labour which he bore<BR>
By that drear sandy way beside the sea,<BR>
Along the unhabited and sunny shore,<BR>
Were to Rogero grievous company:<BR>
Bur for I may not still pursue this lore,<BR>
Nor should you busied with one matter be,<BR>
Rogero I abandon in this heat,<BR>
For Scotland; to pursue Rinaldo&#8217;s beat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
By king, by daughter, and by all degrees,<BR>
To Sir Rinaldo was large welcome paid;<BR>
And next the warrior, at his better ease,<BR>
The occasion of his embassy displayed:<BR>
&#8216;That he from thence and England, subsidies<BR>
Of men was seeking, for his monarch&#8217;s aid,<BR>
In Charles&#8217;s name;&#8217; and added, in his care,<BR>
The justest reasons to support his prayer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
The king made answer, that &#8216;without delay,<BR>
Taxed to the utmost of his power and might,<BR>
His means at Charlemagne&#8217;s disposal lay,<BR>
For the honour of the empire and the right.<BR>
And that, within few days, he in array<BR>
Such horsemen, as he had in arms, would dight;<BR>
And, save that he was now waxed old, would lead<BR>
The expedition he was prayed to speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8216;Nor like consideration would appear<BR>
Worthy to stop him, but that he possessed<BR>
A son, and for such charge that cavalier,<BR>
Measured by wit and force, was worthiest.<BR>
Though not within the kingdom was the peer,<BR>
It was his hope (as he assured his guest)<BR>
He would, while yet preparing was the band,<BR>
Return, and find it mustered to his hand.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
So sent through all his realm, with expedition,<BR>
His treasures, to levy men and steeds;<BR>
And ships prepared, and warlike ammunition,<BR>
And money, stores and victual for their needs.<BR>
Meantime the good Rinaldo on his mission,<BR>
Leaving the courteous king, to England speeds;<BR>
He brought him on his way to Berwick&#8217;s town,<BR>
And was observed to weep when he was gone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
The wind sat in the poop; Rinaldo good<BR>
Embarked and bade farewell to all; the sheet<BR>
Still loosening to the breeze, the skipper stood,<BR>
Till where Thames&#8217; waters, waxing bitter, meet<BR>
Salt ocean: wafted thence by tide of flood,<BR>
Through a sure channel to fair London&#8217;s seat,<BR>
Safely the mariners their course explore,<BR>
Making their way, with aid of sail and oar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
The Emperor Charles, and he, King Otho grave,<BR>
Who was with Charles, by siege in Paris pressed,<BR>
A broad commission to Rinaldo brave,<BR>
With letters to the Prince of Wales addressed,<BR>
And countersigns had given, dispatched to crave<BR>
What foot and horse were by the land possessed.<BR>
The whole to be to Calais&#8217; port conveyed;<BR>
That it to France and Charles might furnish aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
The prince I speak of, who on Otho&#8217;s throne<BR>
Sate in his stead, the vacant helm to guide,<BR>
Such honor did to Aymon&#8217;s valiant son,<BR>
He not with such his king had gratified.<BR>
Next, all to good Rinaldo&#8217;s wish, was done:<BR>
Since for his martial bands on every side,<BR>
In Britain, or the isles which round her lay,<BR>
To assemble near the sea he fixed a day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
But here, sir, it behoves me shift my ground,<BR>
Like him that makes the sprightly viol ring,<BR>
Who often changes chord and varies sound,<BR>
And now a graver strikes, now sharper string:<BR>
Thus I:&#8212;who did to good Rinaldo bound<BR>
My tale, Angelica remembering;<BR>
Late left, where saved from him by hasty flight,<BR>
She had encountered with an anchorite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Awhile I will pursue her story: I<BR>
Told how the maid of him with earnest care,<BR>
Enquired, how she towards the shore might fly:<BR>
Who of the loathed Rinaldo has such fear,<BR>
She dreads, unless she pass the sea, to die,<BR>
As insecure in Europe, far or near,<BR>
But she was by the hermit kept in play,<BR>
Because he pleasure took with her to stay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
His heart with love of that rare beauty glowed,<BR>
And to his frozen marrow pierced the heat;<BR>
Who, after, when he saw that she bestowed<BR>
Small care on him, and thought but of retreat,<BR>
His sluggish courser stung with many a goad;<BR>
But with no better speed he plied his feet.<BR>
Ill was his walk, and worse his trot; nor spur<BR>
Could that dull beast to quicker motion stir:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
And for the flying maid was far before,<BR>
And he would soon have ceased to track her steed,<BR>
To the dark cave recurred the hermit hoar,<BR>
And conjured up of fiends a grisly breed:<BR>
One he selected out of many more,<BR>
And first informed the demon of his need;<BR>
Then in the palfrey bade him play his part,<BR>
Who with the lady bore away his heart:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
And as sagacious dog on mountain tried<BR>
Before, accustomed fox or hare to chase,<BR>
If he behold the quarry choose one side,<BR>
The other takes, and seems to slight the trace:<BR>
But at the turn arriving, is espied,<BR>
Already tearing what he crossed to face;<BR>
So her the hermit by a different road<BR>
Will meet, wherever she her palfrey goad.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
What was the friar&#8217;s design I well surmise;<BR>
And you shall know; but in another page.<BR>
Angelica now slow, now faster, flies,<BR>
Nought fearing this: while conjured by the sage,<BR>
The demon covered in the courser lies;<BR>
As fire sometimes will hide its smothered rage:<BR>
Then blazes with devouring flame and heat,<BR>
Unquenchable, and scarce allows retreat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
After the flying maid had shaped her course<BR>
By the great sea which laves the Gascon shore,<BR>
Still keeping to the rippling waves her horse,<BR>
Where best the moistened sand the palfrey bore,<BR>
Him, plunged into the brine, the fiend perforce<BR>
Dragged, till he swam amid the watery roar.<BR>
Nor what to do the timid damsel knew,<BR>
Save that she closer to her saddle grew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
She cannot, howsoe&#8217;er the rein she ply,<BR>
Govern the horse, who swims the surge to meet:<BR>
Her raiment she collects and holds it high;<BR>
And, not to wet them, gathers up her feet.<BR>
Her tresses, which the breeze still wantonly<BR>
Assaults, dishevelled on her shoulders beat.<BR>
The louder winds are hushed, perchance in duty,<BR>
Intent, like ocean, on such sovereign beauty.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Landward in vain her eyes the damsel bright<BR>
Directs, which water face and breast with tears,<BR>
And ever sees, decreasing to her sight,<BR>
The beach she left, which less and less appears.<BR>
The courser, who was swimming to the right,<BR>
After a mighty sweep, the lady bears<BR>
To shore, where rock and cavern shag the brink,<BR>
As night upon the land begins to sink.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
When in that desert, which but to descry<BR>
Bred fear in the beholder, stood the maid<BR>
Alone, as Ph&#339;bus, plunged in ocean, sky<BR>
And nether earth had left obscured in shade;<BR>
She paused in guise, which in uncertainty<BR>
Might leave whoever had the form surveyed,<BR>
If she were real woman, or some mock<BR>
Resemblance, coloured in the living rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
She, fixed and stupid in her wretchedness,<BR>
Stood on the shifting sand, with ruffled hair:<BR>
Her hands were joined, her lips were motionless,<BR>
Her languid eyes upturned, as in despair,<BR>
Accusing <SMALL>HIM</SMALL> on high, that to distress<BR>
And whelm her, all the fates united were.<BR>
Astound she stood awhile; when grief found vent<BR>
Through eyes and tongue, in tears and in lament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Fortune what more remains, that thou on me<BR>
Shouldst not now satiate thy revengeful thirst?<BR>
What more (she said) can I bestow on thee<BR>
Than, what thou seekest not, this life accurst?<BR>
Thou wast in haste to snatch me from the sea,<BR>
Where I had ended its sad days, immersed;<BR>
Because to torture me with further ill<BR>
Before I die, is yet thy cruel will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But what worse torment yet remains in store<BR>
Beyond, I am unable to descry:<BR>
By thee from my fair throne, which nevermore<BR>
I hope to repossess, compelled to fly;<BR>
I, what is worse, my honour lost deplore;<BR>
For if I sinned not in effect, yet I<BR>
Give matter by my wanderings to be stung<BR>
For wantonness of every carping tongue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What other good is left to woman, who<BR>
Has lost her honour, in this earthly ball?<BR>
What profits it that, whether false or true,<BR>
I am deemed beauteous, and am young withal?<BR>
No thanks to heaven for such a gift are due,<BR>
Whence on my head does every mischief fall.<BR>
For this my brother Argal&igrave;a died;<BR>
To whom small help enchanted arms supplied:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For this the Tartar king, Sir Agrican,<BR>
Subdued my sire, who Galaphron was hight,<BR>
And of Cat&agrave;y in India was great khan;<BR>
&#8217;Tis hence I am reduced to such a plight,<BR>
That wandering evermore, I cannot scan<BR>
At morn, where I shall lay my head at night.<BR>
If thou hast ravished what thou couldst, wealth, friends,<BR>
And honour; say what more thy wrath intends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If death by drowning in the foaming sea<BR>
Was not enough thy wrath to satiate,<BR>
Send, if thou wilt, some beast to swallow me,<BR>
So that he keep me not in pain! Thy hate<BR>
Cannot devise a torment, so it be<BR>
My death, but I shall thank thee for my fate!&#8221;<BR>
Thus, with loud sobs, the weeping lady cried,<BR>
When she beheld the hermit at her side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
From the extremest height the hermit hoar<BR>
Of that high rock above her, had surveyed<BR>
Angelica, arrived upon the shore,<BR>
Beneath the cliff, afflicted and dismayed.<BR>
He to that place had come six days before;<BR>
For him by path untrod had fiend conveyed:<BR>
And he approached her, feigning such a call<BR>
As e&#8217;er Hilarion might have had, or Paul.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
When him, yet unagnized, she saw appear,<BR>
The lady took some comfort, and laid by,<BR>
Emboldened by degrees, her former fear:<BR>
Though still her visage was of death-like dye.<BR>
&#8220;<I>Misericord!</I> father,&#8221; when the friar was near<BR>
(She said), &#8220;for brought to evil pass am I.&#8221;<BR>
And told, still broke by sobs, in doleful tone,<BR>
The story, to her hearer not unknown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
To comfort her, some reasons full of grace,<BR>
Sage and devout the approaching hermit cites:<BR>
And, now his hand upon her moistened face,<BR>
In speaking, now upon her bosom lights:<BR>
As her, securer, next he would embrace:<BR>
Him, kindling into pretty scorn, she smites<BR>
With one hand on his breast, and backward throws,<BR>
Then flushed with honest red, all over glows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
A pocket at the ancient&#8217;s side was dight,<BR>
Where he a cruise of virtuous liquor wore;<BR>
And at those puissant eyes, whence flashed the light<BR>
Of the most radiant torch Love ever bore,<BR>
Threw from the flask a little drop, of might<BR>
To make her sleep: upon the sandy shore<BR>
Already the recumbent damsel lay,<BR>
The greedy elder&#8217;s unresisting prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
   (Stanza XLIX untranslated by Rose)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
   (Lines 1-2 untranslated by Rose)<BR>
Hopeless, at length upon the beach he lies,<BR>
And by the maid, exhausted, falls asleep.<BR>
When to torment him new misfortunes rise:<BR>
Fortune does seldom any measure keep;<BR>
Unused to cut her cruel pastime short,<BR>
If she with mortal man is pleased to sport.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
It here behoves me, from the path I pressed,<BR>
To turn awhile, ere I this case relate:<BR>
In the great northern sea, towards the west,<BR>
Green Ireland past, an isle is situate.<BR>
Ebuda is its name, whose shores infest,<BR>
(Its people wasted through the Godhead&#8217;s hate)<BR>
The hideous orc, and Proteus&#8217; other herd,<BR>
By him against that race in vengeance stirred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Old stories, speak they falsely or aright,<BR>
Tell how a puissant king this country swayed;<BR>
Who had a daughter fair, so passing bright<BR>
And lovely, &#8217;twas no wonder if the maid,<BR>
When on the beach she stood in Proteus&#8217; sight,<BR>
Left him to burn amid the waves: surveyed,<BR>
One day alone, upon that shore in-isled,<BR>
Her he compressed, and quitted great with child.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
This was sore torment to the sire, severe<BR>
And impious more than all mankind; nor he,<BR>
Such is the force of wrath, was moved to spare<BR>
The maid, for reason or for piety.<BR>
Nor, though he saw her pregnant, would forbear<BR>
To execute his sentence suddenly;<BR>
But bade together with the mother kill,<BR>
Ere born, his grandchild, who had done no ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Sea-Proteus to his flocks&#8217; wide charge preferred<BR>
By Neptune, of all ocean&#8217;s rule possessed,<BR>
Inflamed with ire, his lady&#8217;s torment heard,<BR>
And, against law and usage, to molest<BR>
The land (no sluggard in his anger) stirred<BR>
His monsters, orc and sea-calf, with the rest;<BR>
Who waste not only herds, but human haunts,<BR>
Farm-house and town, with their inhabitants:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
And girding them on every side, the rout<BR>
Will often siege to walled cities lay;<BR>
Where in long weariness and fearful doubt,<BR>
The townsmen keep their watch by night and day.<BR>
The fields they have abandoned all about,<BR>
And for a remedy, their last assay,<BR>
To the oracle, demanding counsel, fly,<BR>
Which to the suppliant&#8217;s prayer made this reply:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8216;That it behoved them find a damsel, who<BR>
A form as beauteous as that other wore,<BR>
To be to Proteus offered up, in lieu<BR>
Of the fair lady, slain upon the shore:<BR>
He, if he deems her an atonement due,<BR>
Will keep the damsel, not disturb them more:<BR>
If not, another they must still present,<BR>
And so, till they the deity content.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
And this it was the cruel usage bred;<BR>
That of the damsels held most fair of face,<BR>
To Proteus every day should one be led.<BR>
Till one should in the Godhead&#8217;s sight find grace.<BR>
The first and all those others slain, who fed,<BR>
All a devouring orc, that kept his place<BR>
Beside the port, what time into the main<BR>
The remnant of the herd retired again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Were the old tale of Proteus&#8217; false or true,<BR>
(For this, in sooth, I know not who can read)<BR>
With such a clause was kept by that foul crew<BR>
The savage, ancient statute, which decreed<BR>
That woman&#8217;s flesh the ravening monster, who<BR>
For this came every day to land, should feed.<BR>
Though to be woman is a crying ill<BR>
In every place, &#8217;tis here a greater still.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
O wretched maids! whom &#8217;mid that barbarous rout<BR>
Ill-fortune on that wretched shore has tost!<BR>
Who for the stranger damsel prowl about,<BR>
Of her to make an impious holocaust;<BR>
In that the more they slaughter from without,<BR>
They less the number of their own exhaust.<BR>
But since not always wind and waves convey<BR>
Like plunder, upon every strand they prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
With frigate and with galley wont to roam,<BR>
And other sort of barks they range the sea,<BR>
And, as a solace to their martyrdom,<BR>
From far, or from their isle&#8217;s vicinity,<BR>
Bear women off; with open rapine some,<BR>
These bought by gold, and those by flattery:<BR>
And, plundered from the different lands they scower,<BR>
Crowd with their captives dungeon-cell and tower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Keeping that region close aboard, to explore<BR>
The island&#8217;s lonely bank, a gallery creeps;<BR>
Where, amid stubs upon the grassy shore,<BR>
Angelica, unhappy damsel, sleeps.<BR>
To wood and water there the sailor&#8217;s moor,<BR>
And from the bark, for this, a party leaps;<BR>
And there that matchless flower of earthly charms<BR>
Discovers in the holy father&#8217;s arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Oh! prize too dear, oh! too illustrious prey!<BR>
To glut so barbarous and so base a foe!<BR>
Oh! cruel Fortune! who believed thy sway<BR>
Was of such passing power in things below?<BR>
That thou shouldst make a hideous monster&#8217;s prey<BR>
The beauty, for which Agrican did glow,<BR>
Brought with half Scythia&#8217;s people from the gates<BR>
Of Caucasus, in Ind, to find their fates.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
The beauty, by Circassian Sacripant<BR>
Preferred before his honour and his crown,<BR>
The beauty which made Roland, Brava&#8217;s vaunt,<BR>
Sully his wholesome judgment and renown,<BR>
The beauty which had moved the wide Levant,<BR>
And awed, and turned its kingdom upside down,<BR>
Now has not (thus deserted and unheard)<BR>
One to assist it even with a word.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Oppressed with heavy sleep upon the shore,<BR>
The lovely virgin, ere awake, they chain:<BR>
With her, the enchanter friar the pirates bore<BR>
On board their ship, a sad, afflicted train.<BR>
This done, they hoisted up their sail once more,<BR>
And the bark made the fatal isle again,<BR>
Where, till the lot shall of their prey dispose,<BR>
Her prisoned in a castle they enclose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
But such her matchless beauty&#8217;s power, the maid<BR>
Was able that fierce crew to mollify,<BR>
Who many days her cruel death delayed,<BR>
Preserved until their last necessity;<BR>
And while they damsels from without purveyed,<BR>
Spared such angelic beauty: finally,<BR>
The damsel to the monstrous orc they bring,<BR>
The people all behind her sorrowing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Who shall relate the anguish, the lament<BR>
And outcry which against the welkin knock?<BR>
I marvel that the sea-shore was not rent,<BR>
When she was placed upon the rugged block,<BR>
Where, chained and void of help, the punishment<BR>
Of loathsome death awaits her on the rock.<BR>
This will not I, so sorrow moves me, say,<BR>
Which makes me turn my rhymes another way;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
To find a verse of less lugubrious strain,<BR>
Till I my wearied spirit shall restore:<BR>
For not the squalid snake of mottled stain,<BR>
Nor wild and whelpless tiger, angered more,<BR>
Nor what of venomous, on burning plain,<BR>
Creeps &#8217;twixt the Red and the Atlantic shore,<BR>
Could see the grisly sight, and choose but moan<BR>
The damsel bound upon the naked stone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Oh! if this chance to her Orlando, who<BR>
Was gone to Paris-town to seek the maid,<BR>
Had been reported! or those other two,<BR>
Duped by a post, dispatched from Stygian shade,<BR>
They would have tracked her heavenly footsteps through<BR>
A thousand deaths, to bear the damsel aid.<BR>
But had the warriors of her peril known.<BR>
So far removed, for what would that have done?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
This while round Paris-walls the leaguer lay<BR>
Of famed Troyano&#8217;s son&#8217;s besieging band,<BR>
Reduced to such extremity one day,<BR>
That it nigh fell into the foeman&#8217;s hand;<BR>
And, but that vows had virtue to allay<BR>
The wrath of Heaven, whose waters drenched the land,<BR>
That day had perished by the Moorish lance<BR>
The holy empire and great name of France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
To the just plaint of aged Charlemagne<BR>
The great Creator turned his eyes, and stayed<BR>
The conflagration with a sudden rain,<BR>
Which haply human art had not allayed.<BR>
Wise whosoever seeketh, not in vain,<BR>
His help, than whose there is no better aid!<BR>
Well the religious king, to whom &#8217;twas given,<BR>
Knew that the saving succour was from Heaven.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
All night long counsel of his weary bed,<BR>
Vexed with a ceaseless care, Orlando sought;<BR>
Now here, now there, the restless fancy sped,<BR>
Now turned, now seized, but never held the thought:<BR>
As when, from sun or nightly planet shed,<BR>
Clear water has the quivering radiance caught,<BR>
The flashes through the spacious mansion fly,<BR>
With reaching leap, right, left, and low, and high.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
To memory now returned his lady gay,<BR>
She rather ne&#8217;er was banished from his breast;<BR>
And fanned the secret fire, which through the day<BR>
(Now kindled into flame) had seemed at rest;<BR>
That in his escort even from Cat&agrave;y<BR>
Or farthest Ind, had journeyed to the west;<BR>
There lost: Of whom he had discerned no token<BR>
Since Charles&#8217;s power near Bordeaux-town was broken.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
This in Orlando moved great grief, and he<BR>
Lay thinking on his folly past in vain:<BR>
&#8220;My heart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;oh! how unworthily<BR>
I bore myself! and out, alas! what pain,<BR>
(When night and day I might have dwelt with thee,<BR>
Since this thou didst not in thy grace disdain.)<BR>
To have let them place thee in old Namus&#8217; hand!<BR>
Witless a wrong so crying to withstand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Might I not have excused myself?&#8212;The king<BR>
Had not perchance gainsaid my better right&#8212;<BR>
Of if he had gainsaid my reasoning,<BR>
Who would have taken thee in my despite?<BR>
Why not have armed, and rather let them wring<BR>
My heart out of my breast? But not the might<BR>
Of Charles or all his host, had they been tried,<BR>
Could have availed to tear thee from my side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Oh! had he placed her but in strong repair,<BR>
Guarded in some good fort, or Paris-town!<BR>
&#8212;Since he <I>would</I> trust her to Duke Namus&#8217; care,<BR>
That he should lose her in this way, alone<BR>
Sorts with my wish.&#8212;Who would have kept the fair<BR>
Like me, that would for her to death have gone?<BR>
Have kept her better than my heart or sight:<BR>
Who should and could, yet did not what I might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Without me, my sweet life, beshrew me, where<BR>
Art thou bestowed, so beautiful and young!<BR>
As some lost lamb, what time the daylight fair<BR>
Shuts in, remains the wildering woods among,<BR>
And goes about lamenting here and there,<BR>
Hoping to warn the shepherd with her tongue;<BR>
Till the wolf hear from far the mournful strain,<BR>
And the sad shepherd weep for her in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My hope, where are thou, where? In doleful wise<BR>
Dost thou, perchance, yet rove thy lonely round?<BR>
Art thou, indeed, to ravening wolf a prize,<BR>
Without thy faithful Roland&#8217;s succour found?<BR>
And is the flower, which, with the deities,<BR>
Me, in mid heaven had placed, which, not to wound,<BR>
(So reverent was my love) thy feelings chaste,<BR>
I kept untouched, alas! now plucked and waste?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If this fair flower be plucked, oh, misery! oh,<BR>
Despair! what more is left me but to die?<BR>
Almighty God, with every other woe<BR>
Rather than this, thy wretched suppliant try.<BR>
If this be true, these hands the fatal blow<BR>
Shall deal, and doom me to eternity.&#8221;<BR>
Mixing his plaint with bitter tears and sighs,<BR>
So to himself the grieved Orlando cries.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Already every where, with due repose,<BR>
Creatures restored their weary spirits; laid<BR>
These upon stones and upon feathers those,<BR>
Or greensward, in the beech or myrtle&#8217;s shade:<BR>
But scarcely did thine eyes, Orlando, close,<BR>
So on thy mind tormenting fancies preyed.<BR>
Nor would the vexing thoughts which bred annoy,<BR>
Let thee in peace that fleeting sleep enjoy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
To good Orlando it appeared as he,<BR>
Mid odorous flowers, upon a grassy bed,<BR>
Were gazing on that beauteous ivory,<BR>
Which Love&#8217;s own hand had tinged with native red;<BR>
And those two stars of pure transparency,<BR>
With which he in Love&#8217;s toils his fancy fed:<BR>
Of those bright eyes, and that bright face, I say,<BR>
Which from his breast had torn his heart away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
He with the fullest pleasure overflows,<BR>
That ever happy lover did content:<BR>
But, lo! this time a mighty tempest rose,<BR>
And wasted flowers, and trees uptore and rent.<BR>
Not with the rage with which this whirlwind blows,<BR>
Joust warring winds, north, south, and east, unpent.<BR>
It seemed, as if in search of covering shade,<BR>
He, vainly wandering, through a desert strayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile the unhappy lover lost the dame<BR>
In that dim air, nor how he lost her, weets;<BR>
And, roving far and near, her beauteous name<BR>
Through every sounding wood and plain repeats.<BR>
And while, &#8220;Oh wretched me!&#8221; is his exclaim,<BR>
&#8220;Who has to poison changed my promised sweets?&#8221;<BR>
He of his sovereign lady who with tears<BR>
Demands his aid, the lamentation hears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Thither, whence comes the sound, he swiftly hies,<BR>
And toils, now here, now there, with labour sore:<BR>
Oh! what tormenting grief, to think his eyes<BR>
Cannot again the lovely rays explore!<BR>
&#8212;Lo! other voice from other quarter cries&#8212;<BR>
&#8220;Hope not on earth to enjoy the blessing more.&#8221;<BR>
At that alarming cry he woke, and found<BR>
Himself in tears of bitter sorrow drowned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Not thinking that like images are vain,<BR>
When fear, or when desire disturbs our rest,<BR>
The thought of her, exposed to shame and pain,<BR>
In such a mode upon his fancy pressed,<BR>
He, thundering, leaped from bed, and with what chain<BR>
And plate behoved, his limbs all over dressed;<BR>
Took Brigliadoro from the stall he filled,<BR>
Nor any squire attendant&#8217;s service willed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
And to pass every where, yet not expose<BR>
By this his dignity to stain or slight,<BR>
The old and honoured ensign he foregoes,<BR>
His ancient bearing, quartered red and white.<BR>
And in its place a sable ensign shows,<BR>
Perhaps as suited to his mournful plight,<BR>
That erst he from an Amostantes bore,<BR>
Whom he had slain in fight some time before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
At midnight he departed silently,<BR>
Not to his uncle spake, not to his true<BR>
And faithful comrade Brandimart, whom he<BR>
So dearly cherished, even bade adieu;<BR>
But when, with golden tresses streaming-free,<BR>
The sun from rich Tithonus&#8217; inn withdrew,<BR>
And chased the shades, and cleared the humid air,<BR>
The king perceived Orlando was not there.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
To Charles, to his displeasure, were conveyed<BR>
News that his nephew had withdrawn at night,<BR>
When most he lacked his presence and his aid;<BR>
Nor could he curb his choler at the flight,<BR>
But that with foul reproach he overlaid,<BR>
And sorely threatened the departed knight,<BR>
By him so foul a fault should be repented,<BR>
Save he, returning home, his wrath prevented.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Nor would Orlando&#8217;s faithful Brandimart,<BR>
Who loved him as himself, behind him stay;<BR>
Whether to bring him back he in his heart<BR>
Hoped, or of him ill brooked injurious say:<BR>
And scarce, in his impatience to depart,<BR>
Till fall of eve his sally would delay.<BR>
Lest she should hinder his design, of this<BR>
He nought imparted to his Flordelis:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
To him this was a lady passing dear,<BR>
And from whose side he unwont to stray;<BR>
Endowed with manners, grace, and beauteous cheer,<BR>
Wisdom and wit: if now he went away<BR>
And took no leave, it was because the peer<BR>
Hoped to revisit her that very day.<BR>
But that befel him after, as he strayed,<BR>
Which him beyond his own intent delayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
She when she has expected him in vain<BR>
Well nigh a month, and nought of him discerns,<BR>
Sallies without a guide or faithful train,<BR>
So with desire of him her bosom yearns:<BR>
And many a country seeks for him in vain;<BR>
To whom the story in due place returns.<BR>
No more I now shall tell you of these two,<BR>
More bent Anglantes&#8217; champion to pursue;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Who having old Almontes&#8217; blazonry<BR>
So changed, drew nigh the gate; and there the peer<BR>
Approached a captain of the guard, when he;<BR>
&#8220;I am the County,&#8221; whispered in his ear;<BR>
And (the bridge quickly lowered, and passage free<BR>
At his commandment) by the way most near<BR>
Went straight towards the foe: but what befell<BR>
Him next, the canto which ensues shall tell.</TD></TR>
