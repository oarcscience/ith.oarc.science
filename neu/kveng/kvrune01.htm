<p>IN primeval times, a maiden,<br> Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,<br> Passed for ages her existence<br> In the great expanse of heaven,<br> O'er the prairies yet enfolded.<br> Wearisome the maiden growing,<br> Her existence sad and hopeless,<br> Thus alone to live for ages<br> In the infinite expanses<br> Of the air above the sea-foam,<br> In the far outstretching spaces,<br> In a solitude of ether,<br> She descended to the ocean,<br> Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.<br> Thereupon the rising storm-wind<br> Flying from the East in fierceness,<br> Whips the ocean into surges,<br> Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean<br> Till the waves are white with fervor.<br> To and fro they toss the maiden,<br> Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;<br> With her sport the rolling billows,<br> With her play the storm-wind forces,<br> On the blue back of the waters;<br> On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,<br> Play the forces of the salt-sea,<br> With the lone and helpless maiden;<br> Till at last in full conception,<br> Union now of force and beauty,<br> Sink the storm-winds into slumber;<br> Overburdened now the maiden<br> Cannot rise above the surface;<br> Seven hundred years she wandered,<br> Ages nine of man's existence,<br> Swam the ocean hither, thither,<br> Could not rise above the waters,<br> Conscious only of her travail;<br> Seven hundred years she labored<br> Ere her first-born was delivered.<br> Thus she swam as water-mother,<br> Toward the east, and also southward,<br> Toward the west, and also northward;<br> Swam the sea in all directions,<br> Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,<br> Swam in travail, swam unceasing,<br> Ere her first-born was delivered.</p> 
<p>Then began she gently weeping,<br> Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> Woe is me, in this my travail!<br> Into what have I now fallen?<br> Woe is me, that I unhappy,<br> Left my home in subtle ether,<br> Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,<br> To be tossed by rolling billows,<br> To be rocked by winds and waters,<br> On the far outstretching waters,<br> In the salt-sea's vast expanses,<br> Knowing only pain and trouble!<br> Better far for me, O Ukko!<br> Were I maiden in the Ether,<br> Than within these ocean-spaces,<br> To become a water-mother!<br> All this life is cold and dreary,<br> Painful here is every motion,<br> As I linger in the waters,<br> As I wander through the ocean.<br> Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,<br> Thou the ruler of the heavens,<br> Come thou hither, thou art needed,<br> Come thou hither, I implore thee,<br> To deliver me from trouble,<br> To deliver me in travail.<br> Come I pray thee, hither hasten,<br> Hasten more that thou art needed,<br> Haste and help this helpless maiden!"</p> 
<p>When she ceased her supplications,<br> Scarce a moment onward passes,<br> Ere a beauteous duck descending,<br> Hastens toward the water-mother,<br> Comes a-flying hither, thither,<br> Seeks herself a place for nesting.<br> Flies she eastward, flies she westward,<br> Circles northward, circles southward,<br> Cannot find a grassy hillock,<br> Not the smallest bit of verdure;<br> Cannot find a spot protected,<br> Cannot find a place befitting,<br> Where to make her nest in safety.<br> Flying slowly, looking round her,<br> She descries no place for resting,<br> Thinking loud and long debating,<br> And her words are such as follow:<br> "Build I in the winds my dwelling,<br> On the floods my place of nesting?<br> Surely would the winds destroy it,<br> Far away the waves would wash it."</p> 
<p>Then the daughter of the Ether,<br> Now the hapless water-mother,<br> Raised her shoulders out of water,<br> Raised her knees above the ocean,<br> That the duck might build her dwelling,<br> Build her nesting-place in safety.<br> Thereupon the duck in beauty,<br> Flying slowly, looking round her,<br> Spies the shoulders of the maiden,<br> Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,<br> Now the hapless water-mother,<br> Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,<br> On the blue back of the ocean.<br> Thence she flies and hovers slowly,<br> Lightly on the knee she settles,<br> Finds a nesting-place befitting,<br> Where to lay her eggs in safety.<br> Here she builds her humble dwelling,<br> Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,<br> Six, the golden eggs she lays there,<br> Then a seventh, an egg of iron;<br> Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,<br> Quickly warms them on the knee-cap<br> Of the hapless water-mother;<br> Hatches one day, then a second,<br> Then a third day sits and hatches.<br> Warmer grows the water round her,<br> Warmer is her bed in ocean,<br> While her knee with fire is kindled,<br> And her shoulders too are burning,<br> Fire in every vein is coursing.<br> Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,<br> Shakes her members in succession,<br> Shakes the nest from its foundation,<br> And the eggs fall into ocean,<br> Dash in pieces on the bottom<br> Of the deep and boundless waters.<br> In the sand they do not perish,<br> Not the pieces in the ocean;<br> But transformed, in wondrous beauty<br> All the fragments come together<br> Forming pieces two in number,<br> One the upper, one the lower,<br> Equal to the one, the other.<br> From one half the egg, the lower,<br> Grows the nether vault of Terra:<br> From the upper half remaining,<br> Grows the upper vault of Heaven;<br> From the white part come the moonbeams,<br> From the yellow part the sunshine,<br> From the motley part the starlight,<br> From the dark part grows the cloudage;<br> And the days speed onward swiftly,<br> Quickly do the years fly over,<br> From the shining of the new sun<br> From the lighting of the full moon.</p> 
<p>Still the daughter of the Ether,<br> Swims the sea as water-mother,<br> With the floods outstretched before her,<br> And behind her sky and ocean.<br> Finally about the ninth year,<br> In the summer of the tenth year,<br> Lifts her head above the surface,<br> Lifts her forehead from the waters,<br> And begins at last her workings,<br> Now commences her creations,<br> On the azure water-ridges,<br> On the mighty waste before her.<br> Where her hand she turned in water,<br> There arose a fertile hillock;<br> Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,<br> There she made a hole for fishes;<br> Where she dived beneath the waters,<br> Fell the many deeps of ocean;<br> Where upon her side she turned her,<br> There the level banks have risen;<br> Where her head was pointed landward,<br> There appeared wide bays and inlets;<br> When from shore she swam a distance,<br> And upon her back she rested,<br> There the rocks she made and fashioned,<br> And the hidden reefs created,<br> Where the ships are wrecked so often,<br> Where so many lives have perished.</p> 
<p>Thus created were the islands,<br> Rocks were fastened in the ocean,<br> Pillars of the sky were planted,<br> Fields and forests were created,<br> Checkered stones of many colors,<br> Gleaming in the silver sunlight,<br> All the rocks stood well established;<br> But the singer, Wainamoinen,<br> Had not yet beheld the sunshine,<br> Had not seen the golden moonlight,<br> Still remaining undelivered.<br> Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Lingering within his dungeon<br> Thirty summers altogether,<br> And of winters, also thirty,<br> Peaceful on the waste of waters,<br> On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,<br> Well reflected, long considered,<br> How unborn to live and flourish<br> In the spaces wrapped in darkness,<br> In uncomfortable limits,<br> Where he had not seen the moonlight,<br> Had not seen the silver sunshine.<br> Thereupon these words be uttered,<br> Let himself be heard in this wise:<br> "Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,<br> Take me, thou, O Sun above me,<br> Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,<br> From this dark and dreary prison,<br> From these unbefitting portals,<br> From this narrow place of resting,<br> From this dark and gloomy dwelling,<br> Hence to wander from the ocean,<br> Hence to walk upon the islands,<br> On the dry land walk and wander,<br> Like an ancient hero wander,<br> Walk in open air and breathe it,<br> Thus to see the moon at evening,<br> Thus to see the silver sunlight,<br> Thus to see the Bear in heaven,<br> That the stars I may consider."</p> 
<p>Since the Moon refused to free him,<br> And the Sun would not deliver,<br> Nor the Great Bear give assistance,<br> His existence growing weary,<br> And his life but an annoyance,<br> Bursts he then the outer portals<br> Of his dark and dismal fortress;<br> With his strong, but unnamed finger,<br> Opens he the lock resisting;<br> With the toes upon his left foot,<br> With the fingers of his right hand,<br> Creeps he through the yielding portals<br> To the threshold of his dwelling;<br> On his knees across the threshold,<br> Throws himself head foremost, forward<br> Plunges into deeps of ocean,<br> Plunges hither, plunges thither,<br> Turning with his hands the water;<br> Swims he northward, swims he southward,<br> Swims he eastward, swims he westward,<br> Studying his new surroundings.</p> 
<p>Thus our hero reached the water,<br> Rested five years in the ocean,<br> Six long years, and even seven years,<br> Till the autumn of the eighth year,<br> When at last he leaves the waters,<br> Stops upon a promontory,<br> On a coast bereft of verdure;<br> On his knees he leaves the ocean,<br> On the land he plants his right foot,<br> On the solid ground his left foot,<br> Quickly turns his hands about him,<br> Stands erect to see the sunshine,<br> Stands to see the golden moonlight,<br> That he may behold the Great Bear,<br> That he may the stars consider.<br> Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,<br> Thus the wonderful enchanter<br> Was delivered from his mother,<br> Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.</p>
