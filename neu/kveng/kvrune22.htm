<p>WHEN the marriage was completed,<br> When the many guests had feasted,<br> At the wedding of the Northland,<br> At the Dismal-land carousal,<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola<br> To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br> "Wherefore, bridegroom, dost thou linger,<br> Why art waiting, Northland hero?<br> Sittest for the father's pleasure,<br> For affection of the mother,<br> For the splendor of the maidens,<br> For the beauty of the daughter?<br> Noble son-in-law and brother,<br> Wait thou longer, having waited<br> Long already for the virgin,<br> Thine affianced is not ready,<br> Not prepared, thy life-companion,<br> Only are her tresses braided.</p> 
<p>"Chosen bridegroom, pride of Pohya,<br> Wait thou longer, having waited<br> Long already for the virgin,<br> Thy beloved is preparing,<br> Only is one hand made ready.</p> 
<p>"Famous artist, Ilmarinen,<br> Wait still longer, having waited<br> Long already for the virgin,<br> Thy beloved is not ready,<br> Only is one foot in fur-shoes,"<br> Spake again the ancient Louhi:<br> "Chosen suitor of my daughter,<br> Thou hast thrice in kindness waited,<br> Wait no longer for the virgin,<br> Thy beloved now is ready,<br> Well prepared thy life-companion,<br> Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow.</p> 
<p>"Beauteous daughter, join thy suitor,<br> Follow him, thy chosen husband,<br> Very near is the uniting,<br> Near indeed thy separation.<br> At thy hand the honored bridegroom,<br> Near the door he waits to lead thee,<br> Guide thee to his home and kindred;<br> At the gate his steed is waiting,<br> Restless champs his silver bridle,<br> And the sledge awaits thy presence.</p> 
<p>"Thou wert anxious for a suitor,<br> Ready to accept his offer,<br> Wert in haste to take his jewels,<br> Place his rings upon thy fingers;<br> Now, fair daughter, keep thy promise;<br> To his sledge, with happy footsteps,<br> Hie in haste to join the bridegroom,<br> Gaily journey to the village<br> With thy chosen life-companion,<br> With thy suitor, Ilmarinen.<br> Little hast thou looked about thee,<br> Hast not raised thine eyes above thee,<br> Beauteous maiden of the Northland,<br> Hast thou made a rueful bargain,<br> Full of wailing thine engagement,<br> And thy marriage full of sorrow,<br> That thy father's ancient cottage<br> Thou art leaving now forever,<br> Leaving also friends and kindred,<br> For the, blacksmith, Ilmarinen?</p> 
<p>"O how beautiful thy childhood,<br> In thy father's dwelling-places,<br> Nurtured like a tender flower,<br> Like the strawberry in spring-time<br> Soft thy couch and sweet thy slumber,<br> Warm thy fires and rich thy table;<br> From the fields came corn in plenty,<br> From the highlands, milk and berries,<br> Wheat and barley in abundance,<br> Fish, and fowl, and hare, and bacon,<br> From thy father's fields and forests.</p> 
<p>"Never wert thou, child, in sorrow,<br> Never hadst thou grief nor trouble,<br> All thy cares were left to fir-trees,<br> All thy worry to the copses,<br> All thy weeping to the willows,<br> All thy sighing to the lindens,<br> All thy thinking to the aspens<br> And the birches on the mountains,<br> Light and airy as the leaflet,<br> As a butterfly in summer,<br> Ruddy as a mountain-berry,<br> Beautiful as vernal flowers.</p> 
<p>"Now thou leavest home and kindred,<br> Wanderest to other firesides,<br> Goest to another mother,<br> Other sisters, other brothers,<br> Goest to a second father,<br> To the servant-folk of strangers,<br> From thy native hills and lowlands.<br> There and here the homes will differ,<br> Happier thy mother's hearth-stone;<br> Other horns will there be sounded,<br> Other portals there swing open,<br> Other hinges there be creaking;<br> There the doors thou canst not enter<br> Like the daughters of Wainola,<br> Canst not tend the fires and ovens<br> As will please the minds of strangers.</p> 
<p>"Didst thou think, my fairest maiden,<br> Thou couldst wed and on the morrow<br> Couldst return, if thou shouldst wish it,<br> To thy father's court and dwelling?<br> Not for one, nor two, nor three days,<br> Wilt thou leave thy mother's chambers,<br> Leave thy sisters and thy brothers,<br> Leave thy father's hills and lowlands.<br> Long the time the wife must wander,<br> Many months and years must wander,<br> Work, and struggle, all her life long,<br> Even though the mother liveth.<br> Great, indeed, must be the changes<br> When thou comest back to Pohya,<br> Changed, thy friends and nearest kindred,<br> Changed, thy father's ancient dwellings,<br> Changed, the valleys and the mountains,<br> Other birds will sing thy praises!"</p> 
<p>When the mother thus had spoken,<br> Then the daughter spake, departing:<br> "In my early days of childhood<br> Often I intoned these measures:<br> 'Art a virgin, yet no virgin,<br> Guided by an aged mother,<br> In a brother's fields and forests,<br> In the mansion of a father!<br> Only wilt become a virgin,<br> Only when thou hast a suitor,<br> Only when thou wedst a hero,<br> One foot on the father's threshold,<br> And the other for the snow-sledge<br> That will speed thee and thy husband<br> To his native vales and highlands!'</p> 
<p>"I have wished thus many summers,<br> Sang it often in my childhood,<br> Hoped for this as for the flowers,<br> Welcome as the birds of spring-time.<br> Thus fulfilled are all my wishes,<br> Very near is my departure,<br> One foot on my father's threshold,<br> And the, other for the journey<br> With my husband to his people;<br> Cannot understand the reason<br> That has changed my former feelings,<br> Cannot leave thee now with gladness,<br> Cannot go with great rejoicing<br> From my dear, old home and kindred,<br> Where as maiden I have lingered,<br> From the courts where I was nurtured,<br> From my father's band and guidance,<br> From my faithful mother's counsel.<br> Now I go, a maid of sorrow,<br> Heavy-hearted to the bridegroom,<br> Like the bride of Night in winter,<br> Like the ice upon the rivers.</p> 
<p>"Such is not the mind of others,<br> Other brides of Northland heroes;<br> Others do not leave unhappy,<br> Have no tears, nor cares, nor sorrows,<br> I alas! must weep and murmur,<br> Carry to my grave great sadness,<br> Heart as dark as Death's black river.</p> 
<p>"Such the feelings of the happy,<br> Such the minds of merry maidens:<br> Like the early dawn of spring-time,<br> Like the rising Sun in summer<br> No such radiance awaits me,<br> With my young heart filled with terror;<br> Happiness is not my portion,<br> Like the flat-shore of the ocean,<br> Like the dark rift of the storm-cloud,<br> Like the cheerless nights of winter!<br> Dreary is the day in autumn,<br> Dreary too the autumn evening,<br> Still more dreary is my future!"</p> 
<p>An industrious old maiden,<br> Ever guarding home and kindred,<br> Spake these words of doubtful comfort:<br> "Dost thou, beauteous bride, remember,<br> Canst thou not recall my counsels?<br> These the words that I have taught thee:<br> 'Look not joyfully for suitors,<br> Never heed the tongues of wooers,<br> Look not in the eyes of charmers,<br> At their feet let fall thy vision.<br> He that hath a mouth for sweetness,<br> He that hath an eye for beauty,<br> Offers little that will comfort;<br> Lempo sits upon his forehead,<br> In his mouth dwells dire Tuoni.'</p> 
<p>"Thus, fair bride, did I advise thee,<br> Thus advised my sister's daughter:<br> Should there come the best of suitors,<br> Noblest wooers, proudest lovers,<br> Give to all these wisdom-sayings,<br> Let thine answer be as follows:<br> 'Never will I think it wisdom,<br> Never will it be my pleasure,<br> To become a second daughter,<br> Linger with my husband's mother;<br> Never shall I leave my father,<br> Never wander forth to bondage,<br> At the bidding of a bridegroom:<br> Never shall I be a servant,<br> Wife and slave to any hero,<br> Never will I be submissive<br> To the orders of a husband.'</p> 
<p>"Fairest bride, thou didst not heed me,<br> Gav'st no thought to my advices,<br> Didst not listen to my counsel;<br> Wittingly thy feet have wandered<br> Into boiling tar and water,<br> Hastened to thy suitor's snow-sledge,<br> To the bear-dens of thy husband,<br> On his sledge to be ill-treated,<br> Carried to his native country,<br> To the bondage of his people,<br> There, a subject to his mother.<br> Thou hast left thy mother's dwelling,<br> To the schooling of the master;<br> Hard indeed the master's teachings,<br> Little else than constant torture;<br> Ready for thee are his bridles,<br> Ready for thy bands the shackles,<br> Were not forged for any other;<br> Soon, indeed, thou'lt feel the hardness,<br> Feel the weight of thy misfortune,<br> Feel thy second father's censure,<br> And his wife's inhuman treatment,<br> Hear the cold words or thy brother,<br> Quail before thy haughty sister.</p> 
<p>"Listen, bride, to what I tell thee:<br> In thy home thou wert a jewel,<br> Wert thy father's pride and pleasure,<br> 'Moonlight,' did thy father call thee,<br> And thy mother called thee 'Sunshine,'<br> 'Sea-foam' did thy brother call thee,<br> And thy sister called thee 'Flower.'<br> When thou leavest home and kindred<br> Goest to a second mother,<br> Often she will give thee censure,<br> Never treat thee as her daughter,<br> Rarely will she give thee counsel,<br> Never will she sound thy praises.<br> 'Brush-wood,' will the father call thee,<br> 'Sledge of Rags,' thy husband's mother,<br> 'Flight of Stairs,' thy stranger brother,<br> 'Scare-crow,' will the sister call thee,<br> Sister of thy blacksmith-husband;<br> Then wilt think of my good counsels,<br> Then wilt wish in tears and murmurs,<br> That as steam thou hadst ascended,<br> That as smoke thy soul had risen,<br> That as sparks thy life had vanished.<br> As a bird thou canst not wander<br> From thy nest to circle homeward,<br> Canst not fall and die like leaflets,<br> As the sparks thou canst not perish,<br> Like the smoke thou canst not vanish.</p> 
<p>"Youthful bride, and darling sister,<br> Thou hast bartered all thy friendships,<br> Hast exchanged thy loving father,<br> Thou hast left thy faithful mother<br> For the mother of thy husband;<br> Hast exchanged thy loving brother,<br> Hast renounced thy gentle sister,<br> For the kindred of thy suitor;<br> Hast exchanged thy snow-white covers<br> For the rocky couch of sorrow;<br> Hast exchanged these crystal waters<br> For the waters of Wainola;<br> Hast renounced these sandy sea-shores<br> For the muddy banks of Kalew;<br> Northland glens thou hast forsaken<br> For thy husband's barren meadows;<br> Thou hast left thy berry-mountains<br> For the stubble-fields and deserts.</p> 
<p>"Thou, O maiden, hast been thinking<br> Thou wouldst happy be in wedlock;<br> Neither work, nor care, nor sorrow,<br> From this night would be thy portion,<br> With thy husband for protection.<br> Not to sleep art thou conducted,<br> Not to happiness, nor joyance,<br> Wakefulness, thy night-companion,<br> And thy day-attendant, trouble;<br> Often thou wilt drink of sorrow,<br> Often long for vanished pleasures.</p> 
<p>"When at home thou hadst no head-gear,<br> Thou hadst also little sadness;<br> When thy couch was not of linen,<br> No unhappiness came nigh thee;<br> Head-gear brings but pain and sorrow,<br> Linen breeds bad dispositions,<br> Linen brings but deeps of anguish,<br> And the flax untimely mourning.</p> 
<p>"Happy in her home, the maiden,<br> Happy at her father's fireside,<br> Like the master in his mansion,<br> Happy with her bows and arrows.<br> 'Tis not thus with married women;<br> Brides of heroes may be likened<br> To the prisoners of Moskva,<br> Held in bondage by their masters.</p> 
<p>"As a wife, must weep and labor,<br> Carry trouble on both shoulders;<br> When the next hour passes over,<br> Thou must tend the fire and oven,<br> Must prepare thy husband's dinner,<br> Must direct thy master's servants.<br> When thine evening meal is ready,<br> Thou must search for bidden wisdom<br> In the brain of perch and salmon,<br> In the mouths of ocean whiting,<br> Gather wisdom from the cuckoo,<br> Canst not learn it from thy mother,<br> Mother dear of seven daughters;<br> Cannot find among her treasures<br> Where were born the human instincts,<br> Where were born the minds of heroes,<br> Whence arose the maiden's beauty,<br> Whence the beauty of her tresses,<br> Why all life revives in spring-time.</p> 
<p>"Weep, O weep, my pretty young bride.<br> When thou weepest, weep sincerely,<br> Weep great rivers from thine eyelids,<br> Floods of tears in field and fallow,<br> Lakelets in thy father's dwelling;<br> Weep thy rooms to overflowing,<br> Shed thy tears in great abundance,<br> Lest thou weepest on returning<br> To thy native hills and valleys,<br> When thou visitest thy father<br> In the smoke of waning glory,<br> On his arm a withered tassel.</p> 
<p>"Weep, O weep, my lovely maiden,<br> When thou weepest, weep in earnest,<br> Weep great rivers from thine eyelids;<br> If thou dost not weep sincerely,<br> Thou wilt weep on thy returning<br> To thy Northland home and kindred,<br> When thou visitest thy mother<br> Old and breathless near the hurdles,<br> In her arms a barley-bundle.</p> 
<p>"Weep, O weep, sweet bride of beauty,<br> When thou weepest, weep profusely;<br> If thou dost not weep in earnest,<br> Thou wilt weep on thy returning<br> To thy native vales and highlands,<br> When thou visitest thy brother<br> Lying wounded by the way-side,<br> In his hand but empty honors.</p> 
<p>"Weep, O weep, my sister's daughter,<br> Weep great rivers from thine eyelids;<br> If thou dost not weep sufficient,<br> Thou wilt weep on thy returning<br> To the scenes of happy childhood,<br> When thou visitest thy sister<br> Lying, prostrate in the meadow,<br> In her hand a birch-wood mallet."</p> 
<p>When the ancient maid had ended,<br> Then the young bride sighed in anguish,<br> Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<br> Spake these words in deeps of sorrow:<br> "O, ye sisters, my beloved,<br> Ye companions of my childhood,<br> Playmates of my early summers,<br> Listen to your sister's counsel:<br> Cannot comprehend the reason,<br> Why my mind is so dejected,<br> Why this weariness and sadness,<br> This untold and unseen torture,<br> Cannot understand the meaning<br> Of this mighty weight of sorrow!<br> Differently I had thought it,<br> I had hoped for greater pleasures,<br> I had hoped to sing as cuckoos,<br> On the hill-tops call and echo,<br> When I had attained this station,<br> Reached at last the goal expectant;<br> But I am not like the cuckoo,<br> Singing, merry on the hill-tops;<br> I am like the songless blue-duck,<br> As she swims upon the waters,<br> Swims upon the cold, cold ocean,<br> Icicles upon her pinions.</p> 
<p>"Ancient father, gray-haired mother,<br> Whither do ye wish to lead me,<br> Whither take this bride, thy daughter,<br> That this sorrow may pass over,<br> Where this heavy heart may lighten,<br> Where this grief may turn to gladness?<br> Better it had been, O mother,<br> Hadst thou nursed a block of birch-wood,<br> Hadst thou clothed the colored sandstone,<br> Rather than this hapless maiden,<br> For the fulness of these sorrows,<br> For this keen and killing trouble.</p> 
<p>Many sympathizers tell me:<br> 'Foolish bride, thou art ungrateful,<br> Do not grieve, thou child of sorrow,<br> Thou hast little cause for weeping.'</p> 
<p>"O, deceive me not, my people,<br> Do not argue with me falsely,<br> For alas! I have more troubles<br> Than the waterfalls have pebbles,<br> Than the Ingerland has willows,<br> Than the Suomi-hills have berries;<br> Never could the Pohya plow-horse<br> Pull this mighty weight of sorrow,<br> Shaking not his birchen cross-bar,<br> Breaking not his heavy collar;<br> Never could the Northland reindeer<br> Heavy shod and stoutly harnessed,<br> Draw this load of care and trouble."</p> 
<p>By the stove a babe was playing,<br> And the young child spake as follows:<br> "Why, O fair bride, art thou weeping,<br> Why these tears of pain and sadness?<br> Leave thy troubles to the elk-herds,<br> And thy grief to sable fillies,<br> Let the steeds of iron bridles<br> Bear the burden of thine anguish,<br> Horses have much larger foreheads,<br> Larger shoulders, stronger sinews,<br> And their necks are made for labor,<br> Stronger are their bones and muscles,<br> Let them bear thy heavy burdens.<br> There is little good in weeping,<br> Useless are thy tears of sorrow;<br> Art not led to swamps and lowlands,<br> Nor to banks of little rivers;<br> Thou art led to fields of flowers,<br> Led to fruitful trees and forests,<br> Led away from beer of Pohya<br> To the sweeter mead of Kalew.<br> At thy shoulder waits thy husband,<br> On thy right side, Ilmarinen,<br> Constant friend and life-protector,<br> He will guard thee from all evil;<br> Husband ready, steed in waiting,<br> Gold-and-silver-mounted harness,<br> Hazel-birds that sing and flutter<br> On the courser's yoke and cross-bar;<br> Thrushes also sing and twitter<br> Merrily on hame and collar,<br> Seven bluebirds, seven cuckoos,<br> Sing thy wedding-march in concord.</p> 
<p>"Be no longer full of sorrow,<br> Dry thy tears, thou bride of beauty,<br> Thou hast found a noble husband,<br> Better wilt thou fare than ever,<br> By the side of Ilmarinen,<br> Artist husband, metal-master,<br> Bread-provider of thy table,<br> On the arm of the fish-catcher,<br> On the breast of the elk-hunter,<br> By the side of the bear-killer.<br> Thou hast won the best of suitors,<br> Hast obtained a mighty hero;<br> Never idle is his cross-bow,<br> On the nails his quivers hang not,<br> Neither are his dogs in kennel,<br> Active agents is his bunting.<br> Thrice within the budding spring-time<br> In the early hours of morning<br> He arises from his fare-couch,<br> From his slumber in the brush-wood,<br> Thrice within the sowing season,<br> On his eyes the deer has fallen,<br> And the branches brushed his vesture,<br> And his locks been combed by fir-boughs.<br> Hasten homeward with thy husband,<br> Where thy hero's friends await thee,<br> Where his forests sing thy welcome.</p> 
<p>"Ilmarinen there possesses<br> All the birds that fly in mid-air,<br> All the beasts that haunt the woodlands,<br> All that feed upon the mountains,<br> All that graze on hill and valley,<br> Sheep and cattle by the thousands;<br> Sweet the grass upon his meadows,<br> Sweet the barley in his uplands,<br> In the lowlands corn abundant,<br> Wheat upon the elm-wood fallows,<br> Near the streamlets rye is waving,<br> Waving grain on many acres,<br> On his mountains gold and silver,<br> Rich his mines of shining copper,<br> Highlands filled with magic metals,<br> Chests of jewels in his store-house,<br> All the wealth of Kalevala."</p>
