<p>LEMMINKAINEN, artful husband,<br> Reckless hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Constantly beside his young wife.,<br> Passed his life in sweet contentment,<br> And the years rolled swiftly onward;<br> Ahti thought not of the battles,<br> Nor Kyllikki of the dances.</p> 
<p>Once upon a time it happened<br> That the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Went upon the lake a-fishing,<br> Was not home at early evening,<br> As the cruel night descended;<br> To the village went Kyllikki,<br> To the dance of merry maidens.</p> 
<p>Who will tell the evil story,<br> Who will bear the information<br> To the husband, Lemminkainen?<br> Ahti's sister tells the story,<br> And the sister's name, Ainikki.</p> 
<p>Soon she spreads the cruel tidings,<br> Straightway gives the information,<br> Of Kyllikki's perjured honor,<br> These the words Ainikki utters:<br> "Ahti, my beloved brother,<br> To the village went Kyllikki,<br> To the hall of many strangers,<br> To the plays and village dances,<br> With the young men and the maidens,<br> With the maids of braided tresses,<br> To the halls of joy and pleasure."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, much dejected,<br> Broken-hearted, flushed with anger,<br> Spake these words in measured accents:<br> "Mother dear, my gray-haired mother,<br> Wilt thou straightway wash my linen<br> In the blood of poison-serpents,<br> In the black blood of the adder?<br> I must hasten to the combat,<br> To the camp-fires of the Northland,<br> To the battle-fields of Lapland;<br> To the village went Kyllikki,<br> To the play of merry maidens,<br> To the games and village dances,<br> With the maids of braided tresses."<br> Straightway speaks the wife, Kyllikki:<br> "My beloved husband, Ahti,<br> Do not go to war, I pray thee.<br> In the evening I lay sleeping,<br> Slumbering I saw in dream-land<br> Fire upshooting from the chimney,<br> Flames arising, mounting skyward,<br> From the windows of this dwelling,<br> From the summits of these rafters,<br> Piercing through our upper chambers,<br> Roaring like the fall of waters,<br> Leaping from the floor and ceiling,<br> Darting from the halls and doorways."</p> 
<p>But the doubting Lemminkainen<br> Makes this answer to Kyllikki:<br> "I discredit dreams or women,<br> Have no faith in vows of maidens!<br> Faithful mother of my being,<br> Hither bring my mail of copper;<br> Strong desire is stirring in me<br> For the cup of deadly combat,<br> For the mead of martial conquest."<br> This the pleading mother's answer:<br> "Lemminkainen, son beloved,<br> Do not go to war I pray thee;<br> We have foaming beer abundant,<br> In our vessels beer of barley,<br> Held in casks by oaken spigots;<br> Drink this beer of peace and pleasure,<br> Let us drink of it together."<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "I shall taste no more the viands,<br> In the home of false Kyllikki;<br> Rather would I drink the water<br> From the painted tips of birch-oars;<br> Sweeter far to me the water,<br> Than the beverage of dishonor,<br> At my mother's home and fireside!</p> 
<p>"Hither bring my martial doublet,<br> Bring me now the sword of battle,<br> Bring my father's sword of honor;<br> I must go to upper Northland,<br> To the battle-fields of Lapland,<br> There to win me gold and silver."<br> This the anxious mother's answer:<br> "My beloved Kaukomieli,<br> We have gold in great abundance,<br> Gold and silver in the store-room;<br> Recently upon the uplands,<br> In the early hours of morning,<br> Toiled the workmen in the corn-fields,<br> Plowed the meadows filled with serpents,<br> When the plowshare raised the cover<br> From a chest of gold and silver,<br> Countless was the gold uncovered,<br> Hid beneath the grassy meadow;<br> This the treasure I have brought thee,<br> Take the countless gold in welcome."<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "Do not wish thy household silver,<br> From the wars I'll earn my silver;<br> Gold and silver from the combat<br> Are to me of greater value<br> Than the wealth thou hast discovered.<br> Bring me now my heavy armor,<br> Bring me too my spear and broadsword;<br> To the Northland I must hasten,<br> To the bloody wars of Lapland,<br> Thither does my pride impel me,<br> Thitherward my heart is turning.</p> 
<p>"I have heard a tale of Lapland,<br> Some believe the wondrous story,<br> That a maid in Pimentola<br> Lives that does not care for suitors,<br> Does not care for bearded heroes."<br> This the aged mother's answer:<br> "Warlike Athi, son beloved,<br> In thy home thou hast Kyllikki,<br> Fairest wife of all the islands;<br> Strange to see two wives abiding<br> In the home of but one husband."<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "To the village runs Kyllikki;<br> Let her run to village dances,<br> Let her sleep in other dwellings,<br> With the village youth find pleasure,<br> With the maids of braided tresses."</p> 
<p>Seeks the mother to detain him,<br> Thus the anxious mother answers:<br> "Do not go, my son beloved,<br> Ignorant of Pohya-witchcraft,<br> To the distant homes of Northland<br> Till thou hast the art of magic,<br> Till thou hast some little wisdom<br> Do not go to fields of battle,<br> To the fires of Northland's children,<br> To the slaughter-fields of Lapland,<br> Till of magic thou art master.<br> There the Lapland maids will charm thee,<br> Turyalanders will bewitch thee,<br> Sing thy visage into charcoal,<br> Head and shoulders to the furnace,<br> Into ashes sing thy fore-arm,<br> Into fire direct thy footsteps."<br> Spake the warlike Lemminkainen:<br> Wizards often have bewitched me,<br> And the fascinating serpents;<br> Lapland wizards, three in number,<br> On an eve in time of summer,<br> Sitting on a rock at twilight,<br> Not a garment to protect them,<br> Once bewitched me with their magic;<br> This much they have taken from me,<br> This the sum of all my losses:<br> What the hatchet gains from flint-stone,<br> What the auger bores from granite,<br> What the heel chips from the iceberg,<br> And what death purloins from tomb-stones.</p> 
<p>"Horribly the wizards threatened,<br> Tried to sink me with their magic,<br> In the water of the marshes,<br> In the mud and treacherous quicksand,<br> To my chin in mire and water;<br> But I too was born a hero,<br> Born a hero and magician,<br> Was not troubled by their magic.</p> 
<p>"Straightway I began my singing,<br> Sang the archers with their arrows,<br> Sang the spearmen with their weapons,<br> Sang the swordsmen with their poniards,<br> Sang the singers with their singing,<br> The enchanters with their magic,<br> To the rapids of the rivers,<br> To the highest fall of waters,<br> To the all-devouring whirlpool,<br> To the deepest depths of ocean,<br> Where the wizards still are sleeping,<br> Sleeping till the grass shoots upward<br> Through the beards and wrinkled faces,<br> Through the locks of the enchanters,<br> As they sleep beneath the billows."</p> 
<p>Still entreats the anxious mother,<br> Still beseeches Lemminkainen,<br> Trying to restrain the hero,<br> While Kyllikki begs forgiveness;<br> This the language of the mother:<br> "Do not go, my son beloved,<br> To the villages of Northland,<br> Nor to Lapland's frigid borders;<br> Dire misfortune will befall thee,<br> Star of evil settle o'er thee,<br> Lemminkainen's end, destruction.</p> 
<p>"Couldst thou speak in tongues a hundred,<br> I could not believe thee able,<br> Through the magic of thy singing,<br> To enchant the sons of Lapland<br> To the bottom of the ocean,<br> Dost not know the Tury-language,<br> Canst but speak the tongue of Suomi,<br> Canst not win by witless magic."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, reckless hero,<br> Also known as Kaukomieli,<br> Stood beside his mother, combing<br> Out his sable locks and musing,<br> Brushing down his beard, debating,<br> Steadfast still in his decision,<br> Quickly hurls his brush in anger,<br> Hurls it to the wall opposing,<br> Gives his mother final answer,<br> These the words that Ahti uses:<br> "Dire misfortune will befall me,<br> Some sad fate will overtake me,<br> Evil come to Lemminkainen,<br> When the blood flows from that hair-brush,<br> When blood oozes from those bristles."</p> 
<p>Thus the warlike Lemminkainen<br> Goes to never-pleasant Lapland,<br> Heeding not his mother's warning,<br> Heeding not her prohibition.<br> Thus the hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Quick equips himself for warfare,<br> On his head a copper helmet,<br> On his shoulders caps of copper,<br> On his body iron armor,<br> Steel, the belt around his body;<br> As he girds himself for battle,<br> Ahti thus soliloquizing:<br> "Strong the hero in his armor,<br> Strong indeed in copper helmet,<br> Powerful in mail of iron,<br> Stronger far than any hero<br> On the dismal shores of Lapland,<br> Need not fear their wise enchanters,<br> Need not fear their strongest foemen,<br> Need not fear a war with wizards."</p> 
<p>Grasped he then the sword of battle,<br> Firmly grasped the heavy broadsword<br> That Tuoni had been grinding,<br> That the gods had brightly burnished,<br> Thrust it in the leathern scabbard,<br> Tied the scabbard to his armor.</p> 
<p>How do heroes guard from danger,<br> Where protect themselves from evil?<br> Heroes guard their homes and firesides,<br> Guard their doors, and roofs, and windows,<br> Guard the posts that bold the torch-lights,<br> Guard the highways to the court-yard,<br> Guard the ends of all the gate-ways.<br> Heroes guard themselves from women,<br> Carefully from merry maidens;<br> If in this their strength be wanting,<br> Easy fall the heroes, victims<br> To the snares of the enchanters.<br> Furthermore are heroes watchful<br> Of the tribes of warlike giants,<br> Where the highway doubly branches,<br> On the borders of the blue-rock,<br> On the marshes filled with evil,<br> Near the mighty fall of waters,<br> Near the circling of the whirlpool,<br> Near the fiery springs and rapids.<br> Spake the stout-heart, Lemminkainen:<br> "Rise ye heroes of the broadsword,<br> Ye, the earth's eternal heroes,<br> From the deeps, ye sickle-bearers,<br> From the brooks, ye crossbow-shooters,<br> Come, thou forest, with thine archers,<br> Come, ye thickets, with your armies,<br> Mountain spirits, with your powers,<br> Come, fell Hisi, with thy horrors,<br> Water-mother, with thy dangers,<br> Come, Wellamo, with thy mermaids,<br> Come, ye maidens from the valleys,<br> Come, ye nymphs from winding rivers,<br> Be protection to this hero,<br> Be his day-and-night companions,<br> Body-guard to Lemminkainen,<br> Thus to blunt the spears of wizards,<br> Thus to dull their pointed arrows,<br> That the spears of the enchanters,<br> That the arrows of the archers,<br> That the weapons of the foemen,<br> May not harm this bearded hero.</p> 
<p>"Should this force be insufficient,<br> I can call on other powers,<br> I can call the gods above me,<br> Call the great god of the heavens,<br> Him who gives the clouds their courses,<br> Him who rules through boundless ether,<br> Who directs the march of storm-winds.</p> 
<p>"Ukko, thou O God above me,<br> Thou the father of creation,<br> Thou that speakest through the thunder,<br> Thou whose weapon is the lightning,<br> Thou whose voice is borne by ether,<br> Grant me now thy mighty fire-sword,<br> Give me here thy burning arrows,<br> Lightning arrows for my quiver,<br> Thus protect me from all danger,<br> Guard me from the wiles of witches,<br> Guide my feet from every evil,<br> Help me conquer the enchanters,<br> Help me drive them from the Northland;<br> Those that stand in front of battle,<br> Those that fill the ranks behind me,<br> Those around me, those above me,<br> Those beneath me, help me banish,.<br> With their knives, and swords, and cross-bows,<br> With their spears of keenest temper,<br> With their tongues of evil magic;<br> Help me drive these Lapland wizards<br> To the deepest depths of ocean,<br> There to wrestle with Wellamo."</p> 
<p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Whistled loudly for his stallion,<br> Called the racer from the hurdles,<br> Called his brown steed from the pasture,<br> Threw the harness on the courser,<br> Hitched the fleet-foot to the snow-sledge,<br> Leaped upon the highest cross-bench,<br> Cracked his whip above the racer,<br> And the steed flies onward swiftly,<br> Bounds the sleigh upon its journey,<br> And the golden plain re-echoes;<br> Travels one day, then a second,<br> Travels all the next day northward,<br> Till the third day evening brings him<br> To a sorry Northland village,<br> On the dismal shores of Lapland.</p> 
<p>Here the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Drove along the lowest highway,<br> Through the streets along the border,<br> To a court-yard in the hamlet,<br> Asked one standing in the doorway:<br> "Is there one within this dwelling,<br> That can loose my stallion's breastplate,<br> That can lift his heavy collar,<br> That these shafts can rightly lower?"</p> 
<p>On the floor a babe was playing,<br> And the young child gave this answer:<br> "There is no one in this dwelling<br> That can loose thy stallion's breastplate,<br> That can lift his heavy collar,<br> That the shafts can rightly lower."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, not discouraged,<br> Whips his racer to a gallop,<br> Rushes forward through the village,<br> On the middle of the highways,<br> To the court-yard in the centre,<br> Asks one standing in the threshold,<br> Leaning on the penthouse door-posts:<br> "Is there any one here dwelling<br> That can slip my stallion's bridle,<br> That can loose his leathern breast-straps,<br> That can tend my royal racer?"</p> 
<p>From the fire-place spake a wizard,<br> From her bench the witch made answer:<br> "Thou canst find one in this dwelling,<br> That can slip thy courser's bridle,<br> That can loose his heavy breastplate,<br> That can tend thy royal racer.<br> There are here a thousand heroes<br> That can make thee hasten homeward,<br> That can give thee fleet-foot stallions,<br> That can chase thee to thy country,<br> Reckless rascal and magician,<br> To thy home and fellow minstrels,<br> To the uplands of thy father,<br> To the cabins of thy mother,<br> To the work-bench of thy brother,<br> To the dairy or thy sister,<br> Ere the evening star has risen,<br> Ere the sun retires to slumber."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, little fearing,<br> Gives this answer to the wizard:<br> "I should slay thee for thy pertness,<br> That thy clatter might be silenced."</p> 
<p>Then he whipped his fiery charger,<br> And the steed flew onward swiftly,<br> On the upper of the highways,<br> To the court-yard on the summit.<br> When the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Had approached the upper court-yard,<br> Uttered he the words that follow:<br> "O thou Hisi, stuff this watch-dog,<br> Lempo, stuff his throat and nostrils,<br> Close the mouth of this wild barker,<br> Bridle well the vicious canine,<br> That the watcher may be silent<br> While the hero passes by him."</p> 
<p>Then he stepped within the court-room,<br> With his whip he struck the flooring,<br> From the floor arose a vapor,<br> In the fog appeared a pigmy,<br> Who unhitched the royal racer,<br> From his back removed the harness,<br> Gave the weary steed attention.<br> Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Carefully advanced and listened.<br> No one saw the strange magician,<br> No one heard his cautious footsteps;<br> Heard he songs within the dwelling,<br> Through the moss-stuffed chinks heard voices.<br> Through the walls he beard them singing,<br> Through the doors the peals of laughter.</p> 
<p>Then he spied within the court-rooms,<br> Lurking slyly in the hall-ways,<br> Found the court-rooms filled with singers,<br> By the walls were players seated,<br> Near the doors the wise men hovered,<br> Skilful ones upon the benches,<br> Near the fires the wicked wizards;<br> All were singing songs of Lapland,<br> Singing songs of evil Hisi.</p> 
<p>Now the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<br> Changes both his form and stature,<br> Passes through the inner door-ways,<br> Enters he the spacious court-hall,<br> And these words the hero utters:<br> "Fine the singing quickly ending,<br> Good the song that quickly ceases;<br> Better far to keep thy wisdom<br> Than to sing it on the house-tops."</p> 
<p>Comes the hostess of Pohyola,<br> Fleetly rushing through the door-way,<br> To the centre of the court-room,<br> And addresses thus the stranger:<br> Formerly a dog lay watching,<br> Was a cur of iron-color,<br> Fond of flesh, a bone-devourer,<br> Loved to lick the blood of strangers.<br> Who then art thou of the heroes,<br> Who of all the host of heroes,<br> That thou art within my court-rooms,<br> That thou comest to my dwelling,<br> Was not seen without my portals,<br> Was not scented by my watch-dogs?<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Do not think that I come hither<br> Having neither wit nor wisdom,<br> Having neither art nor power,<br> Wanting in ancestral knowledge,<br> Lacking prudence of the fathers,<br> That thy watch-dogs may devour me.</p> 
<p>"My devoted mother washed me,<br> When a frail and tender baby,<br> Three times in the nights of summer,<br> Nine times in the nights of autumn,<br> That upon my journeys northward<br> I might sing the ancient wisdom,<br> Thus protect myself from danger;<br> When at home I sing as wisely<br> As the minstrels of thy hamlet."</p> 
<p>Then the singer, Lemminkainen,<br> Ancient hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Quick began his incantations,<br> Straightway sang the songs of witchcraft,<br> From his fur-robe darts the lightning,<br> Flames outshooting from his eye-balls,<br> From the magic of his singing<br> From his wonderful enchantment.<br> Sang the very best of singers<br> To the very worst of minstrels,<br> Filled their mouths with dust and ashes,<br> Piled the rocks upon their shoulders,<br> Stilled the best of Lapland witches,<br> Stilled the sorcerers and wizards.<br> Then he banished all their heroes,<br> Banished all their proudest minstrels,<br> This one hither, that one thither,<br> To the lowlands poor in verdure,<br> To the unproductive uplands,<br> To the oceans wanting whiting,<br> To the waterfalls of Rutya,<br> To the whirlpool hot and flaming,<br> To the waters decked with sea-foam,<br> Into fires and boiling waters,<br> Into everlasting torment.</p> 
<p>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Sang the foemen with their broadswords?<br> Sang the heroes with their weapons,<br> Sang the eldest, sang the youngest,<br> Sang the middle-aged, enchanted;<br> Only one he left his senses,<br> He a poor, defenseless shepherd,<br> Old and sightless, halt and wretched,<br> And the old man's name was Nasshut.<br> Spake the miserable shepherd:<br> "Thou hast old and young enchanted,<br> Thou hast banished all our heroes,<br> Why hast spared this wretched shepherd?"<br> This is Lemminkainen's answer:<br> "Therefore have I not bewitched thee:<br> Thou art old, and blind, and wretched<br> Feeble-minded thou, and harmless,<br> Loathsome now without my magic.<br> Thou didst, in thy better life-time,<br> When a shepherd filled with malice,<br> Ruin all thy mother's berries,<br> Make thy sister, too unworthy,<br> Ruin all thy brother's cattle,<br> Drive to death thy father's stallions,<br> Through the marshes, o'er the meadows,<br> Through the lowlands, o'er the mountains,<br> Heeding not thy mother's counsel."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the wretched Nasshut,<br> Angry grew and swore for vengeance,<br> Straightway limping through the door-way,<br> Hobbled on beyond the court-yard,<br> O'er the meadow-lands and pastures,<br> To the river of the death-land,<br> To the holy stream and whirlpool,<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> To the islands of Manala;<br> Waited there for Kaukomieli,<br> Listened long for Lemminkainen,<br> Thinking he must pass this river<br> On his journey to his country,<br> On. the highway to the islands,<br> From the upper shores of Pohya,<br> From the dreary Sariola.</p>
