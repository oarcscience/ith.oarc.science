<p>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> Laves his hands to snowy whiteness,<br> Sits upon the rock of joyance,<br> On the stone of song be settles,<br> On the mount of silver clearness,<br> On the summit, golden colored;<br> Takes the harp by him created,<br> In his hands the harp of fish-bone,<br> With his knee the arch supporting,<br> Takes the harp-strings in his fingers,<br> Speaks these words to those assembled:<br> "Hither come, ye Northland people,<br> Come and listen to my playing,<br> To the harp's entrancing measures,<br> To my songs of joy and gladness."</p> 
<p>Then the singer of Wainola<br> Took the harp of his creation,<br> Quick adjusting, sweetly tuning,<br> Deftly plied his skillful fingers<br> To the strings that he had fashioned.<br> Now was gladness rolled on gladness,<br> And the harmony of pleasure<br> Echoed from the hills and mountains:<br> Added singing to his playing,<br> Out of joy did joy come welling,<br> Now resounded marvelous music,<br> All of Northland stopped and listened.<br> Every creature in the forest,<br> All the beasts that haunt the woodlands,<br> On their nimble feet came bounding,<br> Came to listen to his playing,<br> Came to hear his songs of joyance.<br> Leaped the squirrels from the branches,<br> Merrily from birch to aspen;<br> Climbed the ermines on the fences,<br> O'er the plains the elk-deer bounded,<br> And the lynxes purred with pleasure;<br> Wolves awoke in far-off swamp-lands,<br> Bounded o'er the marsh and heather,<br> And the bear his den deserted,<br> Left his lair within the pine-wood,<br> Settled by a fence to listen,<br> Leaned against the listening gate-posts,<br> But the gate-posts yield beneath him;<br> Now he climbs the fir-tree branches<br> That he may enjoy and wonder,<br> Climbs and listens to the music<br> Of the harp of Wainamoinen.</p> 
<p>Tapiola's wisest senior,<br> Metsola's most noble landlord,<br> And of Tapio, the people,<br> Young and aged, men and maidens,<br> Flew like red-deer up the mountains<br> There to listen to the playing,<br> To the harp, of Wainamoinen.<br> Tapiola's wisest mistress,<br> Hostess of the glen and forest,<br> Robed herself in blue and scarlet,<br> Bound her limbs with silken ribbons,<br> Sat upon the woodland summit,<br> On the branches of a birch-tree,<br> There to listen to the playing,<br> To the high-born hero's harping,<br> To the songs of Wainamoinen.</p> 
<p>All the birds that fly in mid-air<br> Fell like snow-flakes from the heavens,<br> Flew to hear the minstrel's playing,<br> Hear the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> Eagles in their lofty eyrie<br> Heard the songs of the enchanter;<br> Swift they left their unfledged young ones,<br> Flew and perched around the minstrel.<br> From the heights the hawks descended,<br> From the, clouds down swooped the falcon,<br> Ducks arose from inland waters,<br> Swans came gliding from the marshes;<br> Tiny finches, green and golden,<br> Flew in flocks that darkened sunlight,<br> Came in myriads to listen '<br> Perched upon the head and shoulders<br> Of the charming Wainamoinen,<br> Sweetly singing to the playing<br> Of the ancient bard and minstrel.<br> And the daughters of the welkin,<br> Nature's well-beloved daughters,<br> Listened all in rapt attention;<br> Some were seated on the rainbow,<br> Some upon the crimson cloudlets,<br> Some upon the dome of heaven.</p> 
<p>In their hands the Moon's fair daughters<br> Held their weaving-combs of silver;<br> In their hands the Sun's sweet maidens<br> Grasped the handles of their distaffs,<br> Weaving with their golden shuttles,<br> Spinning from their silver spindles,<br> On the red rims of the cloudlets,<br> On the bow of many colors.<br> As they hear the minstrel playing,<br> Hear the harp of Wainamoinen,<br> Quick they drop their combs of silver,<br> Drop the spindles from their fingers,<br> And the golden threads are broken,<br> Broken are the threads of silver.</p> 
<p>All the fish in Suomi-waters<br> Heard the songs of the magician,<br> Came on flying fins to listen<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> Came the trout with graceful motions,<br> Water-dogs with awkward movements,<br> From the water-cliffs the salmon,<br> From the sea-caves came the whiting,<br> From the deeper caves the bill-fish;<br> Came the pike from beds of sea-fern,<br> Little fish with eyes of scarlet,<br> Leaning on the reeds and rushes,<br> With their heads above the surface;<br> Came to bear the harp of joyance,<br> Hear the songs of the enchanter.</p> 
<p>Ahto, king of all the waters,<br> Ancient king with beard of sea-grass,<br> Raised his head above the billows,<br> In a boat of water-lilies,<br> Glided to the coast in silence,<br> Listened to the wondrous singing,<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> These the words the sea-king uttered:<br> "Never have I heard such playing,<br> Never heard such strains of music,<br> Never since the sea was fashioned,<br> As the songs of this enchanter,<br> This sweet singer, Wainamoinen."</p> 
<p>Satko's daughters from the blue-deep,<br> Sisters of the wave-washed ledges,<br> On the colored strands were sitting,<br> Smoothing out their sea-green tresses<br> With the combs of molten silver,<br> With their silver-handled brushes,<br> Brushes forged with golden bristles.<br> When they hear the magic playing,<br> Hear the harp of Wainamoinen,<br> Fall their brushes on the billows,<br> Fall their combs with silver handles<br> To the bottom of the waters,<br> Unadorned their heads remaining,<br> And uncombed their sea-green tresses.</p> 
<p>Came the hostess of the waters,<br> Ancient hostess robed in flowers,<br> Rising from her deep sea-castle,<br> Swimming to the shore in wonder,<br> Listened to the minstrel's playing,<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.<br> As the magic tones re-echoed,<br> As the singer's song out-circled,<br> Sank the hostess into slumber,<br> On the rocks of many colors,<br> On her watery couch of joyance,<br> Deep the sleep that settled o'er her.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Played one day and then a second,<br> Played the third from morn till even.<br> There was neither man nor hero,<br> Neither ancient dame, nor maiden,<br> Not in Metsola a daughter,<br> Whom he did not touch to weeping;<br> Wept the young, and wept the aged,<br> Wept the mothers, wept the daughters<br> Wept the warriors and heroes<br> At the music of his playing,<br> At the songs of the magician.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen's tears came flowing,<br> Welling from the master's eyelids,<br> Pearly tear-drops coursing downward,<br> Larger than the whortle-berries,<br> Finer than the pearls of ocean,<br> Smoother than the eggs of moor-hens,<br> Brighter than the eyes of swallows.<br> From his eves the tear-drops started,<br> Flowed adown his furrowed visage,<br> Falling from his beard in streamlets,<br> Trickled on his heaving bosom,<br> Streaming o'er his golden girdle,<br> Coursing to his garment's border,<br> Then beneath his shoes of ermine,<br> Flowing on, and flowing ever,<br> Part to earth for her possession,<br> Part to water for her portion.<br> As the tear-drops fall and mingle,<br> Form they streamlets from the eyelids<br> Of the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<br> To the blue-mere's sandy margin,<br> To the deeps of crystal waters,<br> Lost among the reeds and rushes.<br> Spake at last the ancient minstrel:<br> "Is there one in all this concourse,<br> One in all this vast assembly<br> That can gather up my tear-drops<br> From the deep, pellucid waters?"</p> 
<p>Thus the younger heroes answered,<br> Answered thus the bearded seniors:<br> "There is none in all this concourse,<br> None in all this vast assembly,<br> That can gather up thy tear-drops<br> From the deep, pellucid waters."<br> Spake again wise Wainamoinen:<br> "He that gathers up my tear-drops<br> From the deeps of crystal waters<br> Shall receive a beauteous plumage."</p> 
<p>Came a raven, flying, croaking,<br> And the minstrel thus addressed him:<br> "Bring, O raven, bring my tear-drops<br> From the crystal lake's abysses;<br> I will give thee beauteous plumage,<br> Recompense for golden service."<br> But the raven failed his master.</p> 
<p>Came a duck upon the waters,<br> And the hero thus addressed him:<br> "Bring O water-bird, my tear-drops;<br> Often thou dost dive the deep-sea,<br> Sink thy bill upon the bottom<br> Of the waters thou dost travel;<br> Dive again my tears to gather,<br> I will give thee beauteous plumage,<br> Recompense for golden service."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the duck departed,<br> Hither, thither, swam, and circled,<br> Dived beneath the foam and billow,<br> Gathered Wainamoinen's tear-drops<br> From the blue-sea's pebbly bottom,<br> From the deep, pellucid waters;<br> Brought them to the great magician,<br> Beautifully formed and colored,<br> Glistening in the silver sunshine,<br> Glimmering in the golden moonlight,<br> Many-colored as the rainbow,<br> Fitting ornaments for heroes,<br> Jewels for the maids of beauty.<br> This the origin of sea-pearls,<br> And the blue-duck's beauteous plumage.</p>
