<p>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<br> Now arranges for a journey<br> To the village of the Northland,<br> To the land of cruel winters,<br> To the land of little sunshine,<br> To the land of worthy women;<br> Takes his light-foot, royal racer,<br> Then adjusts the golden bridle,<br> Lays upon his back the saddle,<br> Silver-buckled, copper-stirruped,<br> Seats himself upon his courser,<br> And begins his journey northward;<br> Plunges onward, onward, onward,<br> Galloping along the highway,<br> In his saddle, gaily fashioned,<br> On his dappled steed of magic,<br> Plunging through Wainola's meadows,<br> O'er the plains of Kalevala.<br> Fast and far he galloped onward,<br> Galloped far beyond Wainola,<br> Bounded o'er the waste of waters,<br> Till he reached the blue-sea's margin,<br> Wetting not the hoofs in running.</p> 
<p>But the evil Youkahainen<br> Nursed a grudge within his bosom,<br> In his heart the worm of envy,<br> Envy of this Wainamoinen,<br> Of this wonderful enchanter.<br> He prepares a cruel cross-bow,<br> Made of steel and other metals,<br> Paints the bow in many colors,<br> Molds the top-piece out or copper,<br> Trims his bow with snowy silver,<br> Gold he uses too in trimming,<br> Then he hunts for strongest sinews,<br> Finds them in the stag of Hisi,<br> Interweaves the flax of Lempo.<br> Ready is the cruel cross-bow,<br> String, and shaft, and ends are finished,<br> Beautiful the bow and mighty,<br> Surely cost it not a trifle;<br> On the back a painted courser,<br> On each end a colt of beauty,<br> Near the curve a maiden sleeping<br> Near the notch a hare is bounding,<br> Wonderful the bow thus fashioned;<br> Cuts some arrows for his quiver,<br> Covers them with finest feathers,<br> From the oak the shafts be fashions,<br> Makes the tips of keenest metal.<br> As the rods and points are finished,<br> Then he feathers well his arrows<br> From the plumage of the swallow,<br> From the wing-quills of the sparrow;<br> Hardens well his feathered arrows,<br> And imparts to each new virtues,<br> Steeps them in the blood of serpents,<br> In the virus of the adder.</p> 
<p>Ready now are all his arrows,<br> Ready strung, his cruel cross-bow.<br> Waiting for wise Wainamoinen.<br> Youkahainen, Lapland's minstrel,<br> Waits a long time, is not weary,<br> Hopes to spy the ancient singer;<br> Spies at day-dawn, spies at evening,<br> Spies he ceaselessly at noontide,<br> Lies in wait for the magician,<br> Waits, and watches, as in envy;<br> Sits he at the open window,<br> Stands behind the hedge, and watches<br> In the foot-path waits, and listens,<br> Spies along the balks of meadows;<br> On his back he hangs his quiver,<br> In his quiver, feathered arrows<br> Dipped in virus of the viper,<br> On his arm the mighty cross-bow,<br> Waits, and watches, and unwearied,<br> Listens from the boat-house window,<br> Lingers at the end of Fog-point,<br> By the river flowing seaward,<br> Near the holy stream and whirlpool,<br> Near the sacred river's fire-fall.</p> 
<p>Finally the Lapland minstrel,<br> Youkahainen of Pohyola,<br> At the breaking of the day-dawn,<br> At the early hour of morning,<br> Fixed his gaze upon the North-east,<br> Turned his eyes upon the sunrise,<br> Saw a black cloud on the ocean,<br> Something blue upon the waters,<br> And soliloquized as follows:<br> "Are those clouds on the horizon,<br> Or perchance the dawn of morning?<br> Neither clouds on the horizon,<br> Nor the dawning of the morning;<br> It is ancient Wainamoinen,<br> The renowned and wise enchanter,<br> Riding on his way to Northland;<br> On his steed, the royal racer,<br> Magic courser of Wainola."</p> 
<p>Quickly now young Youkahainen,<br> Lapland's vain and evil minstrel,<br> Filled with envy, grasps his cross-bow,<br> Makes his bow and arrows ready<br> For the death of Wainamoinen.</p> 
<p>Quick his aged mother asked him,<br> Spake these words to Youkahainen:<br> "For whose slaughter is thy cross-bow,<br> For whose heart thy poisoned arrows?"<br> Youkahainen thus made answer:<br> "I have made this mighty cross-bow,<br> Fashioned bow and poisoned arrows<br> For the death of Wainamoinen,<br> Thus to slay the friend of waters;<br> I must shoot the old magician,<br> The eternal bard and hero,<br> Through the heart, and through the liver,<br> Through the head, and through the shoulders,<br> With this bow and feathered arrows<br> Thus destroy my rival minstrel."</p> 
<p>Then the aged mother answered,<br> Thus reproving, thus forbidding.<br> Do not slay good Wainamoinen,<br> Ancient hero of the Northland,<br> From a noble tribe descended,<br> He, my sister's son, my nephew.<br> If thou slayest Wainamoinen,<br> Ancient son of Kalevala,<br> Then alas! all joy will vanish,<br> Perish all our wondrous singing;<br> Better on the earth the gladness,<br> Better here the magic music,<br> Than within the nether regions,<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> In the realm of the departed,<br> In the land of the hereafter."</p> 
<p>Then the youthful Youkahainen<br> Thought awhile and well considered,<br> Ere he made a final answer.<br> With one hand he raised the cross-bow<br> But the other seemed to weaken,<br> As he drew the cruel bow-string.<br> Finally these words he uttered<br> As his bosom swelled with envy:<br> "Let all joy forever vanish,<br> Let earth's pleasures quickly perish,<br> Disappear earth's sweetest music,<br> Happiness depart forever;<br> Shoot I will this rival minstrel,<br> Little heeding what the end is."</p> 
<p>Quickly now he bends his fire-bow,<br> On his left knee rests the weapon,<br> With his right foot firmly planted,<br> Thus he strings his bow of envy;<br> Takes three arrows from his quiver,<br> Choosing well the best among them,<br> Carefully adjusts the bow-string,<br> Sets with care the feathered arrow,<br> To the flaxen string he lays it,<br> Holds the cross-bow to his shoulder,<br> Aiming well along the margin,<br> At the heart of Wainamoinen,<br> Waiting till he gallops nearer;<br> In the shadow of a thicket,<br> Speaks these words while he is waiting<br> "Be thou, flaxen string, elastic;<br> Swiftly fly, thou feathered ash-wood,<br> Swiftly speed, thou deadly missile,<br> Quick as light, thou poisoned arrow,<br> To the heart of Wainamoinen.<br> If my hand too low should hold thee,<br> May the gods direct thee higher;<br> If too high mine eye should aim thee,<br> May the gods direct thee lower."</p> 
<p>Steady now he pulls the trigger;<br> Like the lightning flies the arrow<br> O'er the head of Wainamoinen;<br> To the upper sky it darteth,<br> And the highest clouds it pierces,<br> Scatters all the flock of lamb-clouds,<br> On its rapid journey skyward.</p> 
<p>Not discouraged, quick selecting,<br> Quick adjusting, Youkahainen,<br> Quickly aiming shoots a second.<br> Speeds the arrow swift as lightning;<br> Much too low he aimed the missile,<br> Into earth the arrow plunges,<br> Pierces to the lower regions,<br> Splits in two the old Sand Mountain.</p> 
<p>Nothing daunted, Youkahainen,<br> Quick adjusting shoots a third one.<br> Swift as light it speeds its journey,<br> Strikes the steed of Wainamoinen,<br> Strikes the light-foot, ocean-swimmer,<br> Strikes him near his golden girdle,<br> Through the shoulder of the racer.</p> 
<p>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<br> Headlong fell upon the waters,<br> Plunged beneath the rolling billows,<br> From the saddle of the courser,<br> From his dappled steed of magic.<br> Then arose a mighty storm-wind,<br> Roaring wildly on the waters,<br> Bore away old Wainamoinen<br> Far from land upon the billows,<br> On the high and rolling billows,<br> On the broad sea's great expanses.</p> 
<p>Boasted then young Youkahainen,<br> Thinking Waino dead and buried,<br> These the boastful words be uttered:<br> "Nevermore, old Wainamoinen,<br> Nevermore in all thy life-time,<br> While the golden moonlight glistens,<br> Nevermore wilt fix thy vision<br> On the meadows of Wainola,<br> On the plains of Kalevala;<br> Full six years must swim the ocean,<br> Tread the waves for seven summers,<br> Eight years ride the foamy billows,<br> In the broad expanse of water;<br> Six long autumns as a fir-tree,<br> Seven winters as a pebble;<br> Eight long summers as an aspen."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the Lapland minstrel<br> Hastened to his room delighting,<br> When his mother thus addressed him<br> "Hast thou slain good Wainamoinen,<br> Slain the son of Kalevala?"<br> Youkahainen thus made answer:<br> "I have slain old Wainamoinen,<br> Slain the son of Kalevala,<br> That he now may plow the ocean,<br> That he now may sweep the waters,<br> On the billows rock and slumber.<br> In the salt-sea plunged he headlong,<br> In the deep sank the magician,<br> Sidewise turned he to the sea-shore<br> On his back to rock forever,<br> Thus the boundless sea to travel,<br> Thus to ride the rolling billows."<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "Woe to earth for this thine action,<br> Gone forever, joy and singing,<br> Vanished is the wit of ages!<br> Thou hast slain good Wainamoinen.<br> Slain the ancient wisdom-singer,<br> Slain the pride of Suwantala,<br> Slain the hero of Wainola,<br> Slain the joy of Kalevala."</p>
