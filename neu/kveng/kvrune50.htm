<p>MARIATTA, child of beauty,<br> Grew to maidenhood in Northland,<br> In the cabin of her father,<br> In the chambers of her mother,<br> Golden ringlets, silver girdles,<br> Worn against the keys paternal,<br> Glittering upon her bosom;<br> Wore away the father's threshold<br> With the long robes of her garments;<br> Wore away the painted rafters<br> With her beauteous silken ribbons;<br> Wore away the gilded pillars<br> With the touching of her fingers;<br> Wore away the birchen flooring<br> With the tramping of her fur-shoes.</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Magic maid of little stature,<br> Guarded well her sacred virtue,<br> Her sincerity and honor,<br> Fed upon the dainty whiting,<br> On the inner bark of birch-wood,<br> On the tender flesh of lambkins.</p> 
<p>When she hastened in the evening<br> To her milking in the hurdles,<br> Spake in innocence as follows:<br> "Never will the snow-white virgin<br> Milk the kine of one unworthy!"</p> 
<p>When she journeyed over snow-fields,<br> On the seat beside her father,<br> Spake in purity as follows:<br> "Not behind a steed unworthy<br> Will I ever ride the snow-sledge!"</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Lived a virgin with her mother,<br> As a maiden highly honored,<br> Lived in innocence and beauty,<br> Daily drove her flocks to pasture,<br> Walking with the gentle lambkins.<br> When the lambkins climbed the mountains,<br> When they gamboled on the hill-tops,<br> Stepped the virgin to the meadow,<br> Skipping through a grove of lindens,<br> At the calling of the cuckoo,<br> To the songster's golden measures.</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Looked about, intently listened,<br> Sat upon the berry-meadow<br> Sat awhile, and meditated<br> On a hillock by the forest,<br> And soliloquized as follows:<br> "Call to me, thou golden cuckoo,<br> Sing, thou sacred bird of Northland,<br> Sing, thou silver breasted songster,<br> Speak, thou strawberry of Ehstland,<br> Tell bow long must I unmarried,<br> As a shepherdess neglected,<br> Wander o'er these bills and mountains,<br> Through these flowery fens and fallows.<br> Tell me, cuckoo of the woodlands,<br> Sing to me how many summers<br> I must live without a husband,<br> As a shepherdess neglected!"</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Lived a shepherd-maid for ages,<br> As a virgin with her mother.<br> Wretched are the lives of shepherds,<br> Lives of maidens still more wretched,<br> Guarding flocks upon the mountains;<br> Serpents creep in bog and stubble,<br> On the greensward dart the lizards;<br> But it was no serpent singing,<br> Nor a sacred lizard calling,<br> It was but the mountain-berry<br> Calling to the lonely maiden:<br> "Come, O virgin, come and pluck me,<br> Come and take me to thy bosom,<br> Take me, tinsel-breasted virgin,<br> Take me, maiden, copper-belted,<br> Ere the slimy snail devours me,<br> Ere the black-worm feeds upon me.<br> Hundreds pass my way unmindful,<br> Thousands come within my hearing,<br> Berry-maidens swarm about me,<br> Children come in countless numbers,<br> None of these has come to gather,<br> Come to pluck this ruddy berry."</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Listened to its gentle pleading,<br> Ran to pick the berry, calling,<br> With her fair and dainty fingers,.<br> Saw it smiling near the meadow,<br> Like a cranberry in feature,<br> Like a strawberry in flavor;<br> But be Virgin, Mariatta,<br> Could not pluck the woodland-stranger,<br> Thereupon she cut a charm-stick,<br> Downward pressed upon the berry,<br> When it rose as if by magic,<br> Rose above her shoes of ermine,<br> Then above her copper girdle,<br> Darted upward to her bosom,<br> Leaped upon the maiden's shoulder,<br> On her dimpled chin it rested,<br> On her lips it perched a moment,<br> Hastened to her tongue expectant<br> To and fro it rocked and lingered,<br> Thence it hastened on its journey,<br> Settled in the maiden's bosom.<br> Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Thus became a bride impregnate,<br> Wedded to the mountain-berry;<br> Lingered in her room at morning,<br> Sat at midday in the darkness,<br> Hastened to her couch at evening.<br> Thus the watchful mother wonders:<br> "What has happened to our Mary,<br> To our virgin, Mariatta,<br> That she throws aside her girdle,<br> Shyly slips through hall and chamber,<br> Lingers in her room at morning,<br> Hastens to her couch at evening,<br> Sits at midday in the darkness?"</p> 
<p>On the floor a babe was playing,<br> And the young child thus made answer:<br> "This has happened to our Mary,<br> To our virgin, Mariatta,<br> This misfortune to the maiden:<br> She has lingered by the meadows,<br> Played too long among the lambkins,<br> Tasted of the mountain-berry."</p> 
<p>Long the virgin watched and waited,<br> Anxiously the days she counted,<br> Waiting for the dawn of trouble.<br> Finally she asked her mother,<br> These the words of Mariatta:<br> "Faithful mother, fond and tender,<br> Mother whom I love and cherish,<br> Make for me a place befitting,<br> Where my troubles may be lessened,<br> And my heavy burdens lightened."<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "Woe to thee, thou Hisi-maiden,<br> Since thou art a bride unworthy,<br> Wedded only to dishonor!"</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Thus replied in truthful measures:<br> "I am not a maid of Hisi,<br> I am not a bride unworthy,<br> Am not wedded to dishonor;<br> As a shepherdess I wandered<br> With the lambkins to the glen-wood,<br> Wandered to the berry-mountain,<br> Where the strawberry had ripened;<br> Quick as thought I plucked the berry,<br> On my tongue I gently laid it,<br> To and fro it rocked and lingered,<br> Settled in my heaving bosom.<br> This the source of all my trouble,<br> Only cause of my dishonor!"</p> 
<p>As the mother was relentless,<br> Asked the maiden of her father,<br> This the virgin-mother's pleading:<br> O my father, full of pity,<br> Source of both my good and evil,<br> Build for me a place befitting,<br> Where my troubles may be lessened,<br> And my heavy burdens lightened."<br> This the answer of the father,<br> Of the father unforgiving:<br> "Go, thou evil child of Hisi,<br> Go, thou child of sin and sorrow,<br> Wedded only to dishonor,<br> To the Great Bear's rocky chamber,<br> To the stone-cave of the growler,<br> There to lessen all thy troubles,<br> There to cast thy heavy burdens!"</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Thus made answer to her father:<br> "I am not a child of Hisi,<br> I am not a bride unworthy,<br> Am not wedded to dishonor;<br> I shall bear a noble hero,<br> I shall bear a son immortal,<br> Who will rule among the mighty,<br> Rule the ancient Wainamoinen."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the virgin-mother<br> Wandered hither, wandered thither,<br> Seeking for a place befitting,<br> Seeking for a worthy birth-place<br> For her unborn son and hero;<br> Finally these words she uttered<br> "Piltti, thou my youngest maiden,<br> Trustiest of all my servants,<br> Seek a place within the village,<br> Ask it of the brook of Sara,<br> For the troubled Mariatta,<br> Child of sorrow and misfortune."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the little maiden,<br> Piltti, spake these words in answer:<br> "Whom shall I entreat for succor,<br> Who will lend me his assistance?<br> These the words of Mariatta:<br> "Go and ask it of Ruotus,<br> Where the reed-brook pours her waters."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,<br> Ever hopeful, ever willing,<br> Hastened to obey her mistress,<br> Needing not her exhortation;<br> Hastened like the rapid river,<br> Like the flying smoke of battle<br> To the cabin of Ruotus.<br> When she walked the hill-tops tottered,<br> When she ran the mountains trembled;<br> Shore-reeds danced upon the pasture,<br> Sandstones skipped about the heather<br> As the maiden, Piltti, hastened<br> To the dwelling of Ruotus.</p> 
<p>At his table in his cabin<br> Sat Ruotus, eating, drinking,<br> In his simple coat of linen.<br> With his elbows on the table<br> Spake the wizard in amazement:<br> "Why hast thou, a maid of evil,<br> Come to see me in my cavern,<br> What the message thou art bringing?<br> Thereupon the servant, Piltti,<br> Gave this answer to the wizard:<br> "Seek I for a spot befitting,<br> Seek I for a worthy birth-place,<br> For an unborn child and hero;<br> Seek it near the Sara-streamlet,<br> Where the reed-brook pours her waters.</p> 
<p>Came the wife of old Ruotus,<br> Walking with her arms akimbo,<br> Thus addressed the maiden, Piltti:<br> "Who is she that asks assistance,<br> Who the maiden thus dishonored,<br> What her name, and who her kindred?"</p> 
<p>"I have come for Mariatta,<br> For the worthy virgin-mother."<br> Spake the wife of old Ruotus,<br> Evil-minded, cruel-hearted:<br> "Occupied are all our chambers,<br> All our bath-rooms near the reed-brook;<br> in the mount of fire are couches,<br> is a stable in the forest,<br> For the flaming horse of Hisi;<br> In the stable is a manger<br> Fitting birth-place for the hero<br> From the wife of cold misfortune,<br> Worthy couch for Mariatta!"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,<br> Hastened to her anxious mistress,<br> Spake these measures, much regretting.<br> "There is not a place befitting,<br> on the silver brook of Sara.<br> Spake the wife of old Ruotus:<br> 'Occupied are all the chambers,<br> All the bath-rooms near the reed-brook;<br> In the mount of fire are couches,<br> Is a stable, in the forest,<br> For the flaming horse of Hisi;<br> In the stable is a manger,<br> Fitting birth-place for the hero<br> From the wife of cold misfortune,<br> Worthy couch for Mariatta.'"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the hapless maiden,<br> Mariatta, virgin-mother,<br> Fell to bitter tears and murmurs,<br> Spake these words in depths of sorrow:<br> "I, alas! must go an outcast,<br> Wander as a wretched hireling,<br> Like a servant in dishonor,<br> Hasten to the burning mountain,<br> To the stable in the forest,<br> Make my bed within a manger,<br> Near the flaming steed of Hisi!"</p> 
<p>Quick the hapless virgin-mother,<br> Outcast from her father's dwelling,<br> Gathered up her flowing raiment,<br> Grasped a broom of birchen branches,<br> Hastened forth in pain and sorrow<br> To the stable in the woodlands,<br> On the heights of Tapio's mountains,<br> Spake these words in supplication:<br> "Come, I pray thee, my Creator,<br> Only friend in times of trouble,<br> Come to me and bring protection<br> To thy child, the virgin-mother,<br> To the maiden, Mariatta,<br> In this hour of sore affliction.<br> Come to me, benignant Ukko,<br> Come, thou only hope and refuge,<br> Lest thy guiltless child should perish,<br> Die the death of the unworthy!"</p> 
<p>When the virgin, Mariatta,<br> Had arrived within the stable<br> Of the flaming horse of Hisi,<br> She addressed the steed as follows:<br> "Breathe, O sympathizing fire-horse,<br> Breathe on me, the virgin-mother,<br> Let thy heated breath give moisture,<br> Let thy pleasant warmth surround me,<br> Like the vapor of the morning;<br> Let this pure and helpless maiden<br> Find a refuge in thy manger!"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the horse, in pity,<br> Breathed the moisture of his nostrils<br> On the body of the virgin,<br> Wrapped her in a cloud of vapor,<br> Gave her warmth and needed comforts,<br> Gave his aid to the afflicted,<br> To the virgin, Mariatta.</p> 
<p>There the babe was born and cradled<br> Cradled in a woodland-manger,<br> Of the virgin, Mariatta,<br> Pure as pearly dews of morning,<br> Holy as the stars in heaven.<br> There the mother rocks her infant,<br> In his swaddling clothes she wraps him,<br> Lays him in her robes of linen;<br> Carefully the babe she nurtures,<br> Well she guards her much-beloved,<br> Guards her golden child of beauty,<br> Her beloved gem of silver.</p> 
<p>But alas! the child has vanished,<br> Vanished while the mother slumbered.<br> Mariatta, lone and wretched,<br> Fell to weeping, broken-hearted,<br> Hastened off to seek her infant.<br> Everywhere the mother sought him,<br> Sought her golden child of beauty,<br> Her beloved gem of silver;<br> Sought him underneath the millstone,<br> In the sledge she sought him vainly,<br> Underneath the sieve she sought him,<br> Underneath the willow-basket,<br> Touched the trees, the grass she parted,<br> Long she sought her golden infant,<br> Sought him on the fir-tree-mountain,<br> In the vale, and hill, and heather;<br> Looks within the clumps of flowers,<br> Well examines every thicket,<br> Lifts the juniper and willow,<br> Lifts the branches of the alder.</p> 
<p>Lo! a star has come to meet her,<br> And the star she thus beseeches-.<br> "O, thou guiding-star of Northland,<br> Star of hope, by God created,<br> Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me<br> Where my darling child has wandered,<br> Where my holy babe lies hidden?"<br> Thus the star of Northland answers:<br> "If I knew, I would not tell thee;<br> 'Tis thy child that me created,<br> Set me here to watch at evening,<br> In the cold to shine forever,<br> Here to twinkle in the darkness."</p> 
<p>Comes the golden Moon to meet her,<br> And the Moon she thus beseeches:<br> "Golden Moon, by Ukko fashioned,<br> Hope and joy of Kalevala,<br> Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me<br> Where my darling child has wandered,<br> Where my holy babe lies hidden?<br> Speaks the golden Moon in answer:<br> "If I knew I would not tell thee;<br> 'Tis thy child that me created,<br> Here to wander in the darkness,<br> All alone at eve to wander<br> On my cold and cheerless journey,<br> Sleeping only in the daylight,<br> Shining for the good of others."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the virgin-mother<br> Falls again to bitter weeping,<br> Hastens on through fen and forest,<br> Seeking for her babe departed.</p> 
<p>Comes the silver Sun to meet her,<br> And the Sun she thus addresses:<br> "Silver Sun by Ukko fashioned,<br> Source of light and life to Northland,<br> Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me<br> Where my darling child has wandered,<br> Where my holy babe lies hidden?"<br> Wisely does the Sun make answer:<br> "Well I know thy babe's dominions,<br> Where thy holy child is sleeping,<br> Where Wainola's light lies hidden;<br> 'Tis thy child that me created,<br> Made me king of earth and ether,<br> Made the Moon and Stars attend me,<br> Set me here to shine at midday,<br> Makes me shine in silver raiment,<br> Lets me sleep and rest at evening;<br> Yonder is thy golden infant,<br> There thy holy babe lies sleeping,<br> Hidden to his belt in water,<br> Hidden in the reeds and rushes."</p> 
<p>Mariatta, child of beauty,<br> Virgin-mother of the Northland,<br> Straightway seeks her babe in Swamp-land,<br> Finds him in the reeds and rushes;<br> Takes the young child on her bosom<br> To the dwelling of her father.</p> 
<p>There the infant grew in beauty,<br> Gathered strength, and light, and wisdom,<br> All of Suomi saw and wondered.<br> No one knew what name to give him;<br> When the mother named him, Flower,<br> Others named him, Son-of-Sorrow.</p> 
<p>When the virgin, Mariatta,<br> Sought the priesthood to baptize him,<br> Came an old man, Wirokannas,<br> With a cup of holy water,<br> Bringing to the babe his blessing;<br> And the gray-beard spake as follows:<br> "I shall not baptize a wizard,<br> Shall not bless a black-magician<br> With the drops of holy water;<br> Let the young child be examined,<br> Let us know that he is worthy,<br> Lest he prove the son of witchcraft."</p> 
<p>Thereupon old Wirokannas<br> Called the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> To inspect the infant-wonder,<br> To report him good or evil.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> Carefully the child examined,<br> Gave this answer to his people:<br> "Since the child is but an outcast,<br> Born and cradled in a manger,<br> Since the berry is his father;<br> Let him lie upon the heather,<br> Let him sleep among the rushes,<br> Let him live upon the mountains;<br> Take the young child to the marshes,<br> Dash his head against the birch-tree."</p> 
<p>Then the child of Mariatta,<br> Only two weeks old, made answer:<br> "O, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Son of Folly and Injustice,<br> Senseless hero of the Northland,<br> Falsely hast thou rendered judgment.<br> In thy years, for greater follies,<br> Greater sins and misdemeanors,<br> Thou wert not unjustly punished.<br> In thy former years of trouble,<br> When thou gavest thine own brother,<br> For thy selfish life a ransom,<br> Thus to save thee from destruction,<br> Then thou wert not sent to Swamp-land<br> To be murdered for thy follies.<br> In thy former years of sorrow,<br> When the beauteous Aino perished<br> In the deep and boundless blue-sea,<br> To escape thy persecutions,<br> Then thou wert not evil-treated,<br> Wert not banished by thy people."</p> 
<p>Thereupon old Wirokannas,<br> Of the wilderness the ruler,<br> Touched the child with holy water,<br> Crave the wonder-babe his blessing,<br> Gave him rights of royal heirship,<br> Free to live and grow a hero,<br> To become a mighty ruler,<br> King and Master of Karyala.</p> 
<p>As the years passed Wainamoinen<br> Recognized his waning powers,<br> Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,<br> Sang his farewell song to Northland,<br> To the people of Wainola;<br> Sang himself a boat of copper,<br> Beautiful his bark of magic;<br> At the helm sat the magician,<br> Sat the ancient wisdom-singer.<br> Westward, westward, sailed the hero<br> O'er the blue-back of the waters,<br> Singing as he left Wainola,<br> This his plaintive song and echo:<br> "Suns may rise and set in Suomi,<br> Rise and set for generations,<br> When the North will learn my teachings,<br> Will recall my wisdom-sayings,<br> Hungry for the true religion.<br> Then will Suomi need my coming,<br> Watch for me at dawn of morning,<br> That I may bring back the Sampo,<br> Bring anew the harp of joyance,<br> Bring again the golden moonlight,<br> Bring again the silver sunshine,<br> Peace and plenty to the Northland."</p> 
<p>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> In his copper-banded vessel,<br> Left his tribe in Kalevala,<br> Sailing o'er the rolling billows,<br> Sailing through the azure vapors,<br> Sailing through the dusk of evening,<br> Sailing to the fiery sunset,<br> To the higher-landed regions,<br> To the lower verge of heaven;<br> Quickly gained the far horizon,<br> Gained the purple-colored harbor.<br> There his bark be firmly anchored,<br> Rested in his boat of copper;<br> But be left his harp of magic,<br> Left his songs and wisdom-sayings,<br> To the lasting joy of Suomi.</p>
