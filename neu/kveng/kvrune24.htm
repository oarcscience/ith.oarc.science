<p>OSMOTAR, the bride-instructor,<br> Gives the wedding-guests this counsel,<br> Speaks these measures to the bridegroom:<br> "Ilmarinen, artist-brother,<br> Best of all my hero-brothers,<br> Of my mother's sons the dearest,<br> Gentlest, truest, bravest, grandest,<br> Listen well to what I tell thee<br> Of the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Of thy beauteous life-companion<br> Bridegroom, praise thy fate hereafter,<br> Praise forever thy good fortune;<br> If thou praisest, praise sincerely,<br> Good the maiden thou hast wedded,<br> Good the bride that Ukko gives thee,<br> Graciously has God bestowed her.<br> Sound her praises to thy father,<br> Praise her virtues to thy mother,<br> Let thy heart rejoice in secret,<br> That thou hast the Bride of Beauty,<br> Lovely Maiden of the Rainbow!</p> 
<p>"Brilliant near thee stands the maiden,<br> At thy shoulder thy companion,<br> Happy under thy protection,<br> Beautiful as golden moonlight,<br> Beautiful upon thy bosom,<br> Strong to do thy kindly bidding,<br> Labor with thee as thou wishest,<br> Rake the hay upon thy meadows,<br> Keep thy home in full perfection,<br> Spin for thee the finest linen,<br> Weave for thee the richest fabrics,<br> Make for thee the softest raiment,<br> Make thy weaver's loom as merry<br> As the cuckoo of the forest;<br> Make the shuttle glide in beauty<br> Like the ermine of the woodlands;<br> Make the spindle twirl as deftly<br> As the squirrel spins the acorn;<br> Village-maidens will not slumber<br> While thy young bride's loom is humming,<br> While she plies the graceful shuttle.</p> 
<p>"Bridegroom of the Bride of Beauty,<br> Noblest of the Northland heroes,<br> Forge thyself a scythe for mowing,<br> Furnish it with oaken handle,<br> Carve it in thine ancient smithy,<br> Hammer it upon thine anvil,<br> Have it ready for the summer,<br> For the merry days of sunshine;<br> Take thy bride then to the lowlands,<br> Mow the grass upon thy meadows,<br> Rake the hay when it is ready,<br> Make the reeds and grasses rustle,<br> Toss the fragrant heads of clover,<br> Make thy hay in Kalevala<br> When the silver sun is shining.</p> 
<p>"When the time has come for weaving,<br> To the loom attract the weaver,<br> Give to her the spools and shuttles,<br> Let the willing loom be worthy,<br> Beautiful the frame and settle;<br> Give to her what may be needed,<br> That the weaver's song may echo,<br> That the lathe may swing and rattle,<br> Ma y be heard within the village,<br> That the aged may remark it,<br> And the village-maidens question:<br> 'Who is she that now is weaving,<br> What new power now plies the shuttle?'<br> "Make this answer to the question:<br> 'It is my beloved weaving,<br> My young bride that plies the shuttle.'</p> 
<p>"Shall the weaver's weft be loosened,<br> Shall the young bride's loom be tightened?<br> Do not let the weft be loosened,<br> Nor the weaver's loom be tightened;<br> Such the weaving of the daughters<br> Of the Moon beyond the cloudlets;<br> Such the spinning of the maidens<br> Of the Sun in high Jumala,<br> Of the daughters of the Great Bear,<br> Of the daughters of the Evening.</p> 
<p>Bridegroom, thou beloved hero,<br> Brave descendant of thy fathers,<br> When thou goest on a journey,<br> When thou drivest on the highway,<br> Driving with the Rainbow-daughter,<br> Fairest bride of Sariola,<br> Do not lead her as a titmouse,<br> As a cuckoo of the forest,<br> Into unfrequented places,<br> Into copses of the borders,<br> Into brier-fields and brambles,<br> Into unproductive marshes;<br> Let her wander not, nor stumble<br> On opposing rocks and rubbish.<br> Never in her father's dwelling,<br> Never in her mother's court-yard,<br> Has she fallen into ditches,<br> Stumbled hard against the fences,<br> Run through brier-fields, nor brambles,<br> Fallen over rocks, nor rubbish.</p> 
<p>"Magic bridegroom of Wainola,<br> Wise descendant of the heroes,<br> Never let thy young wife suffer,<br> Never let her be neglected,<br> Never let her sit in darkness,<br> Never leave her unattended.<br> Never in her father's mansion,<br> In the chambers of her mother,<br> Has she sat alone in darkness,<br> Has she suffered for attention;<br> Sat she by the crystal window,<br> Sat and rocked, in peace and plenty,<br> Evenings for her father's pleasure,<br> Mornings for her mother's sunshine.<br> Never mayest thou, O bridegroom,<br> Lead the Maiden of the Rainbow<br> To the mortar filled with sea-grass,<br> There to grind the bark for cooking,<br> There to bake her bread from stubble,<br> There to knead her dough from tan-bark<br> Never in her father's dwelling,<br> Never in her mother's mansion,<br> Was she taken to the mortar,<br> There to bake her bread from sea-grass.<br> Thou shouldst lead the Bride of Beauty<br> To the garner's rich abundance,<br> There to draw the till of barley,<br> Grind the flour and knead for baking,<br> There to brew the beer for drinking,<br> Wheaten flour for honey-biscuits.</p> 
<p>"Hero-bridegroom of Wainola,<br> Never cause thy Bride of Beauty<br> To regret her day of marriage;<br> Never make her shed a tear-drop,<br> Never fill her cup with sorrow.<br> Should there ever come an evening<br> When thy wife shall feel unhappy,<br> Put the harness on thy racer,<br> Hitch the fleet-foot to the snow-sled; <br> Take her to her father's dwelling,<br> To the household of her mother;<br> Never in thy hero-lifetime,<br> Never while the moonbeams glimmer,<br> Give thy fair spouse evil treatment,<br> Never treat her as thy servant;<br> Do not bar her from the cellar,<br> Do not lock thy best provisions<br> Never in her father's mansion,<br> Never by her faithful mother<br> Was she treated as a hireling.<br> Honored bridegroom of the Northland,</p> 
<p>Proud descendant of the fathers,<br> If thou treatest well thy young wife,<br> Worthily wilt thou be treated;<br> When thou goest to her homestead,<br> When thou visitest her father,<br> Thou shalt meet a cordial welcome.</p> 
<p>"Censure not the Bride of Beauty,<br> Never grieve thy Rainbow-maiden,<br> Never say in tones reproachful,<br> She was born in lowly station,<br> That her father was unworthy;<br> Honored are thy bride's relations,<br> From an old-time tribe, her kindred;<br> When of corn they sowed a measure,<br> Each one's portion was a kernel;<br> When they sowed a cask of flax-seed,<br> Each received a thread of linen.<br> Never, never, magic husband,<br> Treat thy beauty-bride unkindly,<br> Teach her not with lash of servants,<br> Strike her not with thongs of leather;<br> Never has she wept in anguish<br> From the birch-whip of her mother.<br> Stand before her like a rampart,<br> Be to her a strong protection,<br> Do not let thy mother chide her,<br> Let thy father not upbraid her,<br> Never let thy guests offend her;<br> Should thy servants bring annoyance,<br> They may need the master's censure;<br> Do not harm the Bride of Beauty,<br> Never injure her thou lovest;<br> Three long years hast thou been wooing,<br> Hoping every mouth to win her.</p> 
<p>"Counsel with the bride of heaven,<br> To thy young wife give instruction,<br> Kindly teach thy bride in secret,<br> In the long and dreary evenings,<br> When thou sittest at the fireside;<br> Teach one year, in words of kindness,<br> Teach with eyes of love a second,<br> In the third year teach with firmness.<br> If she should not heed thy teaching,<br> Should not hear thy kindly counsel<br> After three long years of effort,<br> Cut a reed upon the lowlands,<br> Cut a nettle from the border,<br> Teach thy wife with harder measures.<br> In the fourth year, if she heed not,<br> Threaten her with sterner treatment,<br> With the stalks of rougher edges,<br> Use not yet the thongs of leather,<br> Do not touch her with the birch-whip.<br> If she does not heed this warning,<br> Should she pay thee no attention,<br> Cut a rod upon the mountains,<br> Or a willow in the valleys,<br> Hide it underneath thy mantle,<br> That the stranger may not see it,<br> Show it to thy wife in secret,<br> Shame her thus to do her duty,<br> Strike not yet, though disobeying.<br> Should she disregard this warning,<br> Still refuse to heed thy wishes,<br> Then instruct her with the willow,<br> Use the birch-rod from the mountains<br> In the closet of thy dwelling,<br> In the attic of thy mansion;<br> Strike, her not upon the common,<br> Do not conquer her in public,<br> Lest the villagers should see thee,<br> Lest the neighbors hear her weeping,<br> And the forests learn thy troubles.<br> Touch thy wife upon the shoulders,<br> Let her stiffened back be softened.<br> Do not touch her on the forehead,<br> Nor upon the ears, nor visage;<br> If a ridge be on her forehead,<br> Or a blue mark on her eyelids,<br> Then her mother would perceive it,<br> And her father would take notice,<br> All the village-workmen see it,<br> And the village-women ask her<br> 'Hast thou been in heat of battle,<br> Hast thou struggled in a conflict,<br> Or perchance the wolves have torn thee,<br> Or the forest-bears embraced thee,<br> Or the black-wolf be thy husband,<br> And the bear be thy protector?'"</p> 
<p>By the fire-place lay a gray-beard,<br> On the hearth-stone lay a beggar,<br> And the old man spake as follows:<br> "Never, never, hero-husband,<br> Follow thou thy young wife's wishes,<br> Follow not her inclinations,<br> As, alas! I did, regretful;<br> Bought my bride the bread of barley,<br> Veal, and beer, and best of butter,<br> Fish and fowl of all descriptions,<br> Beer I bought, home-brewed and sparkling,<br> Wheat from all the distant nations,<br> All the dainties of the Northland;<br> All of this was unavailing,<br> Gave my wife no satisfaction,<br> Often came she to my chamber,<br> Tore my sable locks in frenzy,<br> With a visage fierce and frightful,<br> With her eyeballs flashing anger,<br> Scolding on and scolding ever,<br> Ever speaking words of evil,<br> Using epithets the vilest,<br> Thought me but a block for chopping.<br> Then I sought for other measures,<br> Used on her my last resources,<br> Cut a birch-whip in the forest,<br> And she spake in tones endearing;<br> Cut a juniper or willow,<br> And she called me 'hero-darling';<br> When with lash my wife I threatened,<br> Hung she on my neck with kisses."</p> 
<p>Thus the bridegroom was instructed,<br> Thus the last advices given.</p> 
<p>Then the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Beauteous bride of Ilmarinen,<br> Sighing heavily and moaning,<br> Fell to weeping, heavy-hearted,<br> Spake these words from depths of sorrow:<br> "Near, indeed, the separation,<br> Near, alas! the time for parting,<br> Near the time for my departure;<br> O the anguish of the parting,<br> O the pain of separation,<br> From these walls renowned and ancient,<br> From this village of the Northland,<br> From these scenes of peace and plenty,<br> Where my faithful mother taught me,<br> Where my father gave instruction<br> To me in my happy childhood,<br> When my years were few and tender!<br> As a child I did not fancy,<br> Never thought of separation<br> From the confines of this cottage,<br> From these dear old hills and mountains,<br> But, alas! I now must journey,<br> Since I now cannot escape it;<br> Empty is the bowl of parting,<br> All the farewell-beer is taken,<br> And my husband's sledge is waiting,<br> With the break-board looking southward,<br> Looking from my father's dwelling.</p> 
<p>"How shall I give compensation,<br> How repay, on my departure,<br> All the kindness of my mother,<br> All the counsel of my father,<br> All the friendship of my brother,<br> All my sister's warm affection?<br> Gratitude to thee, dear father,<br> For my former-life and blessings,<br> For the comforts of thy table,<br> For the pleasures of my childhood!<br> Gratitude to thee, dear mother,<br> For thy tender care and guidance,<br> For my birth and for my culture,<br> Nurtured by thy purest life-blood!<br> Gratitude to thee, dear brother,<br> Gratitude to thee, sweet sister,<br> To the servants of my childhood,<br> To my many friends and playmates!</p> 
<p>"Never, never, aged father,<br> Never, thou, beloved mother,<br> Never, ye, my kindred spirits,<br> Never harbor care, nor sorrow,<br> Never fall to bitter weeping,<br> Since thy child has gone to others,<br> To the distant home of strangers,<br> To the meadows of Wainola,<br> From her father's fields and firesides.<br> Shines the Sun of the Creator,<br> Shines the golden Moon of Ukko,<br> Glitter all the stars of heaven,<br> In the firmament of ether,<br> Full as bright on other homesteads;<br> Not upon my father's uplands,<br> Not upon my home in childhood,<br> Shines the Star of Joyance only.</p> 
<p>"Now the time has come for parting<br> From my father's golden firesides,<br> From my brother's welcome hearth-stone,<br> From the chambers of my sister,<br> From my mother's happy dwelling;<br> Now I leave the swamps and lowlands,<br> Leave the grassy vales and mountains,<br> Leave the crystal lakes and rivers,<br> Leave the shores and sandy shallows,<br> Leave the white-capped surging billows,<br> Where the maidens swim and linger,<br> Where the mermaids sing and frolic;<br> Leave the swamps to those that wander,<br> Leave the corn-fields to the plowman,<br> Leave the forests to the weary,<br> Leave the heather to the rover,<br> Leave the copses to the stranger,<br> Leave the alleys to the beggar,<br> Leave the court-yards to the rambler,<br> Leave the portals to the servant,<br> Leave the matting to the sweeper,<br> Leave the highways to the roebuck,<br> Leave the woodland-glens to lynxes,<br> Leave the lowlands to the wild-geese,<br> And the birch-tree to the cuckoo.<br> Now I leave these friends of childhood,<br> Journey southward with my husband,<br> To the arms of Night and Winter,<br> O'er the ice-grown seas of Northland.</p> 
<p>"Should I once again, returning,<br> Pay a visit to my tribe-folk,<br> Mother would not hear me calling,<br> Father would not see me weeping,<br> Calling at my mother's grave-stone,<br> 'Weeping o'er my buried father,<br> On their graves the fragrant flowers,<br> Junipers and mournful willows,<br> Verdure from my mother's tresses,<br> From the gray-beard of my father.</p> 
<p>"Should I visit Sariola,<br> Visit once again these borders,<br> No one here would bid me welcome.<br> Nothing in these hills would greet me,<br> Save perchance a few things only,<br> By the fence a clump of osiers,<br> And a land-mark at the corner,<br> Which in early youth I planted,<br> When a child of little stature.</p> 
<p>"Mother's kine perhaps will know me,<br> Which so often I have watered,<br> Which I oft have fed and tended,<br> Lowing now at my departure,<br> In the pasture cold and cheerless;<br> Sure my mother's kine will welcome<br> Northland's daughter home returning.<br> Father's steeds may not forget me,<br> Steeds that I have often ridden,<br> When a maiden free and happy,<br> Neighing now for me departing,<br> In the pasture of my brother,<br> In the stable of my father;<br> Sure my father's steeds will know me,<br> Bid Pohyola's daughter welcome.<br> Brother's faithful dogs may know me,<br> That I oft have fed and petted,<br> Dogs that I have taught to frolic,<br> That now mourn for me departing,<br> In their kennels in the court-yard,<br> In their kennels cold and cheerless;<br> Sure my brother's dogs will welcome<br> Pohya's daughter home returning.<br> But the people will not know me,<br> When I come these scenes to visit,<br> Though the fords remain as ever,<br> Though unchanged remain the rivers,<br> Though untouched the flaxen fish-nets<br> On the shores await my coming.</p> 
<p>"Fare thou well, my dear old homestead,<br> Fare ye well, my native bowers;<br> It would give me joy unceasing<br> Could I linger here forever.<br> Now farewell, ye halls and portals,<br> Leading to my father's mansion;<br> It would give me joy unceasing<br> Could I linger here forever.<br> Fare ye well, familiar gardens<br> Filled with trees and fragrant flowers;<br> It would give me joy unceasing,<br> Could I linger here forever.<br> Send to all my farewell greetings,<br> To the fields, and groves, and berries;<br> Greet the meadows with their daisies,<br> Greet the borders with their fences,<br> Greet the lakelets with their islands,<br> Greet the streams with trout disporting,<br> Greet the hills with stately pine-trees,<br> And the valleys with their birches.<br> Fare ye well, ye streams and lakelets,<br> Fertile fields, and shores of ocean,<br> All ye aspens on the mountains,<br> All ye lindens of the valleys,<br> All ye beautiful stone-lindens,<br> All ye shade-trees by the cottage,<br> All ye junipers and willows,<br> All ye shrubs with berries laden,<br> Waving grass and fields of barley,<br> Arms of elms, and oaks, and alders,<br> Fare ye well, dear scenes of childhood,<br> Happiness of days departed!"</p> 
<p>Ending thus, Pohyola's daughter<br> Left her native fields and fallows,<br> Left the darksome Sariola,<br> With her husband, Ilmarinen,<br> Famous son of Kalevala.</p> 
<p>But the youth remained for singing,<br> This the chorus of the children:<br> "Hither came a bird of evil '<br> Flew in fleetness from the forest,<br> Came to steal away our virgin,<br> Came to win the Maid of Beauty;<br> Took away our fairest flower,<br> Took our mermaid from the waters,<br> Won her with his youth and beauty,<br> With his keys of ancient wisdom.<br> Who will lead us to the sea-beach,<br> Who conduct us to the rivers?<br> Now the buckets will be idle,<br> On the hooks will rest the fish-poles,<br> Now unswept will lie the matting,<br> And unswept the halls of birch-wood,<br> Copper goblets be unburnished,<br> Dark the handles of the pitchers,<br> Fare thou well, dear Rainbow Maiden."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, happy bridegroom,<br> Hastened homeward with the daughter<br> Of the hostess of Pohyola,<br> With the beauty of the Northland<br> Fleetly flew the hero's snow-sledge,<br> Loudly creaked, and roared, and rattled<br> Down the banks of Northland waters,<br> By the side of Honey-inlet,<br> On the back of Sandy Mountain.<br> Stones went rolling from the highway,<br> Like the winds the sledge flew onward,<br> On the yoke rang hoops of iron,<br> Loud the spotted wood resounded,<br> Loudly creaked the bands of willow,<br> All the birchen cross-bars trembled,<br> And the copper-bells rang music,<br> In the racing of the fleet-foot,<br> In the courser's gallop homeward;<br> Journeyed one day, then a second,<br> Journeyed still the third day onward,<br> In one hand the reins of magic,<br> While the other grasped the maiden,<br> One foot resting on the cross-bar,<br> And the other in the fur-robes.<br> Merrily the steed flew homeward,<br> Quickly did the highways shorten,<br> Till at last upon the third day,<br> As the sun was fast declining,<br> There appeared the blacksmith's furnace,<br> Nearer, Ilmarinen's dwelling,<br> Smoke arising high in ether,<br> Clouds of smoke to lofty heaven,<br> From the village of Wainola,<br> From the suitor's forge and smithy,<br> From the chimneys of the hero,<br> From the home of the successful.</p>
