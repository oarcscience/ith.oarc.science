<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch VIII</H1> 
Of the most Holy Graal here beginneth another branch in such wise
as the authority witnesseth and Joseph that made recoverance
thereof, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.
<P>
<P>
TITLE I.
<P>
This high history and profitable witnesseth us that the son of
the Widow Lady sojourned still with his uncle King Pelles in the
hermitage, and through distress of the evil that he had had since
he came forth of the house of King Fisherman, was he confessed to
his uncle and told him of what lineage he was, and that his name
was Perceval.  But the good Hermit the good King had given him
the name of Parluifet, for that he was made of himself.  King
Hermit was one day gone into the forest, and the good knight
Parluifet felt himself sounder of health and lustier than he wont
to be.  He heard the birds sing in the forest, and his heart
began to swell of knighthood, and he minded him of the adventures
he wont to find in the forest and of the damsels and knights that
he wont to meet, and never was he so fain of arms as was he at
that time, for that he had been sojourning so long within doors.
He felt courage in his heart and lustiness in his limbs and
fainness in his thought.  Right soon armeth he himself and
setteth the saddle on his horse and mounteth forthwith.  He
prayeth God give him adventure that he may meet good knight,
setteth himself forth of his uncle's hermitage and entereth into
the forest that was broad and shady.  He rideth until he cometh
into a launde that was right spacious, and seeth a leafy tree
that was at the head of the launde.  He alighteth in the shadow,
and thinketh to himself that two knights might joust on this bit
of ground fair and well, for the place was right broad.  And,
even as he was thinking on this wise, he heard a horse neigh full
loud in the forest three times, and right glad was he thereof and
said: "Ha, God, of your sweetness grant that there be a knight
with that horse, so may I prove whether there be any force or
valour or knighthood in me.  For I know not now what strength I
may have, nor even whether my heart be sound and my limbs whole.
For on a knight that hath neither hardihood nor valour in
himself, may not another knight that hath more force in him
reasonably prove his mettle, for many a time have I heard say
that one is better than other.  And for this pray I to the
Saviour and this be a knight that cometh there, that he may have
strength and hardihood and mettle to defend his body against mine
own, for great desire have I to run upon him.  Grant now that he
slay me not, nor I him!"
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
Therewithal, he looketh before him, and seeth the knight issue
from the forest and enter into the launde.  The knight was armed
and had at his neck a white shield with a cross of gold.  He
carried his lance low, and sate upon a great destrier and rode at
a swift pace.  As soon as Perceval seeth him, he steadieth him in
his stirrups and setteth spear in rest and smiteth his horse with
his spurs, right joyous, and goeth toward the knight a great
gallop.  Then he crieth: "Sir Knight, cover you of your shield to
guard you as I do of mine to defend my body, for you do I defy on
this side slaying, and our Lord God grant that I find you so good
knight as shall try what hardihood of heart I may have, for I am
not such as I have been aforetime, and better may one learn of a
good knight than of a bad."
<P>
With that he smiteth the knight upon his shield with such a sweep
that he maketh him lose one of his stirrups and pierceth his
shield above the boss, and passeth beyond full speed.  And the
knight marvelleth much, and maketh demand, saying, "Fair Sir,
what misdeed have I done you?"
<P>
Perceval is silent, and hath no great joy of this that he hath
not overthrown the knight, but not so easy was he to overthrow,
for he was one of the knights of the world that could most of
defence of arms.  He goeth toward Perceval as fast as his horse
may carry him and Perceval toward him.  They mell together upon
their shields right stiffly, so that they pierce and batter them
with the points of their spears.  And Perceval thrusteth his
spear into the flesh two finger-breadths, and the knight doth not
amiss, for he passeth his spear right through his arm so that the
shafts of the lances were splintered.  They hurtle together
either against other at the passing so mightily, that the
flinders of iron from the mail of their habergeons stick into
their foreheads and faces, and the blood leapeth forth by mouth
and nose so that their habergeons were all bloody.  They drew
their swords with a right great sweep.  The knight of the white
shield holdeth Perceval's rein and saith: "Gladly would I know
who you are and wherefore you hate me, for you have wounded me
right sore, and sturdy knight have I found you and of great
strength."
<P>
Perceval saith not a word to him and runneth again upon him sword
drawn, and the knight upon him, and right great buffets either
giveth other on the helm, so that their eyes all sparkle of stars
and the forest resoundeth of the clashing of their swords.  Right
tough was the battle and right horrible, for good knights were
both twain.  But the blood that ran down from their wounds at
last slackened their sinews, albeit the passing great wrath that
the one had against the other, and the passing great heat of
their will, had so enchafed them they scarce remembered the
wounds that they had, and still dealt each other great buffets
without sparing.
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
King Hermit cometh from labouring in the forest and findeth not
his nephew in the hermitage, whereof is he right sorrowful, and
he mounteth on a white mule that he had therewithin.  She was
starred in the midst of her forehead with a red cross.  Josephus
the good clerk witnesseth us that this same mule had belonged to
Joseph of Abarimacie at the time he was Pilate's soldier, and
that he bequeathed her to King Pelles.  King Hermit departeth
from the hermitage and prayeth God grant him to find his nephew.
He goeth through the forest and rideth until he draweth nigh the
launde where the two knights were.  He heareth the strokes of the
swords, and cometh towards them full speed and setteth him
between the twain to forbid them.
<P>
"Ha, sir," saith he to the Knight of the White Shield, "Right
great ill do you to combat against this knight that hath lain
sick this long time in this forest, and fight sorely have you
wounded him."
<P>
"Sir," saith the-knight, "As much hath he done by me, and never
would I have run upon him now had he not challenged me, and he is
not minded to tell me who he is nor whence ariseth his hatred of
me."
<P>
"Fair Sir," saith the Hermit, "And you, who are you?"
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "I will tell you. I am the son of King
Ban of Benoic."
<P>
"Ha, fair nephew," saith King Hermit to Perceval, "See here your
cousin, for King Ban of Benoic was your father's cousin-german.
Make him right great cheer!"
<P>
He maketh them take off their helmets and lower their ventails,
and then kiss one another, afterward he leadeth them to his
hermitage.  They alight together.  He calleth his own squire that
waited upon him, and made them be disarmed right tenderly.  There
was a damsel within that was cousin-german to King Pelles and had
tended Perceval within in his sickness.  She washeth their wounds
right sweetly and cleanseth them of the blood.  And they see that
Lancelot is sorer wounded than Perceval.
<P>
"Damsel," saith the Hermit, "How seemeth you?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Needs must this knight sojourn here, for his
wound is in a right perilous place."
<P>
"Hath he danger of death?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "In no wise of this wound, but behoveth him
take good heed thereto."
<P>
"God be praised!" saith he, "and of my nephew how seemeth you?"
<P>
"Sir, the wound that he hath will be soon healed.  He will have
none ill thereof."
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
The damsel, that was right cunning of leech-craft, tended the
wounds of the knights, and made them whole as best she might, and
King Hermit himself gave counsel therein.  But and Perceval had
borne his shield that was there within, of sinople with a white
hart, Lancelot would have known him well, nor would there have
been any quarrel between them, for he had heard tell of this
shield at the court of King Arthur.  The authority of this story
recordeth that the two knights are in hermitage, and that
Perceval is well-nigh whole; but Lancelot hath sore pain of his
wound and is still far from his healing.
