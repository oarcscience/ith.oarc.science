# The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch IX

TITLE I.

Now the story is silent about the two knights for a little time, and
speaketh of the squire that Messire Gawain meeteth in the midst of the
forest, that told him he went seek the son of the Widow Lady that had
slain his father. And the squire saith that he will go to avenge him,
wherefore cometh he to the court of King Arthur, for that he had heard
tell how all good knights repaired thither. And he seeth the shield hang
on the column in the midst of the hall that the Damsel of the Car had
brought thither. The squire knoweth it well, and kneeleth before the
King and saluteth him, and the King returneth his salute and asketh who
he is.

"Sir," saith he, "I am the son of the Knight of the Red Shield of the
Forest of Shadows, that was slain of the Knight that ought to bear the
shield that hangeth on this column, wherefore would I right gladly hear
tidings of him."

"As gladly would I," saith the King, "so that no evil came to him
thereof, for he is the knight of the world that I most desire."

"Sir," saith the Squire, "Well behoveth me to hate him for that he slew
my father. He that ought to bear this shield was squire when he slew
him, wherefore am I the more sorrowful for that I thought to be avenged
upon him squire. But this I may not do, wherefore I pray you for God's
sake that you will make me knight, for the like favour are you
accustomed to grant unto others."

"What is your name, fair friend?" saith the King.

"Sir," saith he, "I am called Clamados of the Shadows."

Messire Gawain that had repaired to court, was in the hall, and said to
the King: "If this squire be enemy of the Good Knight that ought to bear
this shield, behoveth you not set forward his mortal enemy but rather
set him back, for he is the Best Knight of the world and the most chaste
that liveth in the world and of the most holy lineage, and therefore
have you sojourned right long time in this castle to await his coming. I
say not this for the hindering of the squire's advancement, but that you
may do nought whereof the Good Knight may have cause of complaint
against you."

"Messire Gawain," saith Queen Guenievre, "well know I that you love my
Lord's honour, but sore blame will he have if he make not this one
knight, for so much hath he never refused to do for any; nor yet will
the Good Knight have any misliking thereof, for greater shame should he
have, and greater despite of the hatred of a squire than of a knight;
for never yet was good knight that was not prudent and well-advised and
slow to take offence. Wherefore I tell you that he will assuredly listen
to reason, and I commend my Lord the rather that he make him knight, for
much blame would he have of gainsaying him."

"Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "So you are content, I am happy."

The King made him knight right richly, and when he was clad in the
robes, they of the court declare and witness that never this long time
past had they seen at the court knight of greater comeliness. He
sojourned therein long time, and , was much honoured of the King and all
the barons. He was every day on the watch for the Good Knight that
should come for the shield, but the hour and the place were not as yet.

II\.

When he saw that he did not come, he took leave of the King and the
Queen and all them of the court, and departed, thinking him that he
would go prove his knighthood in some place until he should have heard
tidings of his mortal enemy. He rideth amidst the great forests bearing
a red shield like as did his father, and he was all armed as for
defending of his body. And a long space of time he rideth, until one day
he cometh to the head of a forest, and he espied his way that ran
between two mountains and saw that he had to pass along the midst of the
valley that lay at a great depth. He looketh before him and seeth a tree
far away from him, and underneath were three damsels alighted, and one
prayed God right heartily aloud that He would send them betimes a knight
that durst convoy them through this strait pass.

III\.

Clamodos heareth the damsel and cometh thitherward. When they espied
him, great joy have they thereof and rise up to meet him. "Sir, say
they, "Welcome may you be!"

"Damsels," saith he, "Good adventure may you have! And whom await you
here?" saith he.

"We await," saith the Mistress of the damsels, "some knight that shall
clear this pass, for no knight durst pass hereby."

"What is the pass; then, damsel?" saith he.

"It is the one of a lion, and a lion, moreover, so fell and horrible
that never was none seen more cruel. And there is a knight with the lion
between the two mountains that is right good knight and hardy and
comely. Howbeit none durst pass without great company of folk. But the
knight that hath repair with the lion is seldom there, for so he were
there we need fear no danger, for much courtesy is there in him and
valour."

And the knight looketh and seeth in the shadow of the forest three fair
stags harnessed to a car.

"Ha," saith he, "you are the Damsel of the Car, wherefore may you well
tell me tidings of the knight of whom I am in quest."

"Who is he?" saith the Damsel.

"It is he that should bear a shield banded argent and azure with a red
cross."

"Of him am I likewise in quest," saith the Damsel; "please God, we shall
hear tidings of him betimes."

"Damsel" saith the knight, "that would I. And for that you are in quest
of him as am I likewise, I will convoy you beyond this pass."

The Damsel maketh her Car go on before, and the damsels go before the
knight; and so enter they into the field of the lion, and right fair
land found they therewithin. Clamados looketh and seeth the hall within
an enclosure and seeth the lion that lay at the entrance of the gateway.
As soon as he espieth Clamados and the damsels, he cometh toward them
full speed, mouth open and ears pricked up.

"Sir," saith the Damsel, "and you defend not your horse on foot, he is
dead at the first onset."

IV\.

Clamados is alighted to his feet, by her counsel, and holdeth his spear
in his fist, and the lion rampeth toward him all in a fury. Clamados
receiveth him on the point of his spear, and smiteth him therewith so
stoutly that it passeth a fathom beyond his neck. He draweth back his
spear without breaking it, and thinketh to smite him again. But the lion
cheateth him, and arising himself on his two hinder feet, setteth his
fore feet on his shoulders, then huggeth him toward him like as one man
doth another. But the grip was sore grievous, for he rendeth his
habergeon in twain and so teareth away as much flesh as he can claw hold
on.

V.

When Clamados felt himself wounded, he redoubled his hardihood, and
grippeth the lion so straitly to him that he wringeth a huge roar out of
him, and then flingeth him to the ground beneath him. Then he draweth
his sword and thrusteth it to the heart right through the breast. The
lion roareth so loud that all the mountains resound thereof. Clamados
cutteth off his head and goeth to hang it at the door of the hall. Then
he cometh back to his horse and mounteth the best he may. And the Damsel
saith to him, "Sir, you are sore wounded."

"Damsel," said he, "please God, I shall take no hurt thereof."

Thereupon, behold you a squire that issueth forth of the hall and cometh
after him full speed. "Hold, Sir Knight," saith he; "Foul wrong have you
wrought, for you have slain the lion of the most courteous knight that
may be known, and the fairest and most valiant of this kingdom, and in
his despite have you hung the head at his door! Right passing great
outrage have you done hereby!"

"Fair sweet friend," saith Clamados, "it may well be that the lord is
right courteous, but the lion was rascal and would have slain me and
them that were passing by. And your lord loved him so much he should
have chained him up, for better liketh me that I slew him than that he
should slay me."

"Sir," saith the squire, "there is no road this way, for it is a
forbidden land whereof certain would fain reave my lord, and it was
against the coming of his enemies that the lion was allowed forth
unchained."

"And what name hath your lord, fair friend?" saith Clamados.

"Sir, he is called Meliot of Logres, and he is gone in quest of Messire
Gawain, of whom he holdeth the land, for right dear is he to him."

"Messire Gawain," saith Clamados, "left I at the court of King Arthur,
but behoveth him depart thence or ever I return thither."

"By my head," saith the squire, "faith would I you might meet them both
twain, if only my lord knew that you had slain him his lion."

"Fair friend," saith Clamados, "and he be as courteous as you say, no
misliking will he have of me thereof, for I slew him in defending mine
own body, and God forbid I should meet any that would do me evil
therefor."

VI\.

Thereupon the knight and the damsels depart and pass the narrow strait
in the lion's field, and ride on until they draw nigh a right rich
castle seated in a meadowland surrounded of great waters and high
forests, and the castle was always void of folk. And they were fain to
turn thitherward, but they met a squire that told them that in the
castle was not a soul, albeit and they would ride forward they would
find great plenty of folk. So far forward have they ridden that they are
come to the head of a forest and see great foison of tents stretched
right in the midst of a launde, and they were compassed round of a great
white sheet that seemed from afar to be a long white wall with crenels,
and it was a good league Welsh in length. They came to the entrance of
the tents and heard great joy within, and when they had entered they saw
dames and damsels, whereof was great plenty, and of right passing great
beauty were they. Clamados alighteth, that was right sore wounded. The
Damsel of the Car was received with right great joy. Two of the damsels
come to Clamados, of whom make they right great joy. Afterward they lead
him to a tent and made disarm him. Then they washed his wounds right
sweetly and tenderly. Then they brought him a right rich robe and made
him be apparelled therein, and led him before the ladies of the tents,
that made right great joy of him.

VII\.

"Lady," saith the Damsel of the Car, "This knight hath saved my life,
for he hath slain the lion on account of which many folk durst not come
to you, wherefore make great joy of him."

"Greater joy may I not make, than I do, nor the damsels that are herein,
for we await the coming of the Good Knight that is healed, from day to
day. And now is there nought in the world I more desire to see."

"Lady," saith Clamados, "Who is this Good Knight?"

"The son of the Widow Lady of the Valleys of Camelot," saith she.

"Tell me, Lady, do you say that he will come hither presently?"

"So methinketh," saith she.

"Lady, I also shall have great joy thereof, and God grant he come
betimes!"

"Sir Knight," saith she, "What is your name?"

"Lady" saith he, "I am called Clamados, and I am son of the lord of the
Forest of Shadows."

She throweth her arms on his neck and kisseth and embraceth him right
sweetly, and saith: "Marvel not that I make you joy thereof, for you are
the son of my sister-in-law, nor have I any friend nor blood-kindred so
nigh as are you, and fain would I you should be lord of all my land and
of me, as is right and reason."

The damsels of the tents make right great joy of him when they know the
tidings that he is so nigh of kin to the Lady of the Tents. And he
sojourned therewithin until that he was whole and heal, awaiting the
coming of the knight of whom he had heard the tidings. And the damsels
marvel them much that he cometh not, for the damsel that had tended him
was therewithin and telleth them that he was healed of his arm, but that
Lancelot is not yet whole, wherefore he is still within the hermitage.

VIII\.

This high history witnesseth us and recordeth that Joseph, who maketh
remembrance thereof, was the first priest that sacrificed the body of
Our Lord, and forsomuch ought one to believe the words that come of him.
You have heard tell how Perceval was of the lineage of Joseph of
Abarimacie, whom God so greatly loved for that he took down His body
hanging on the cross, which he would not should lie in the prison there
where Pilate had set it. For the highness of the lineage whereof the
Good Knight was descended ought one willingly to hear brought to mind
and recorded the words that are of him. The story telleth us that he was
departed of the hermitage all sound and whole, albeit he hath left
Lancelot, for that his wound was not yet healed, but he hath promised
him that he will come back to him so soon as he may. He rideth amidst a
forest, all armed, and cometh toward evensong to the issue of the forest
and seeth a castle before him right fair and well seated, and goeth
thitherward for lodging, for the sun was set. He entereth into the
castle and alighteth. The lord cometh to meet him that was a tall knight
and a red, and had a felon look, and his face scarred in many places;
and knight was there none therewithin save only himself and his
household.

IX\.

When he seeth Perceval alighted, he runneth to bar the door, and
Perceval cometh over against him. For all greeting, the knight saluteth
him thus: "Now shall you have," saith he, "such guerdon as you have
deserved. Never again shall you depart hence, for my mortal enemy are
you, and right hardy are you thus to throw yourself upon me, for you
slew my brother the Lord of the Shadows, and Chaos the Red am I that war
upon your mother, and this castle have I reft of her. In like manner
will I wring the life out of you or ever you depart hence!"

"Already," saith Perceval, "have I thrown myself on this your hostel to
lodge with you, wherefore to blame would you be to do me evil. But lodge
me this night as behoveth one knight do for another, and on the morrow
at departing let each do the best he may."

"By my head!" saith Chaos the Red, "mortal enemy of mine will I never
harbour here save I harbour him dead."

He runneth to the hall above, and armeth himself as swiftly as he may,
and taketh his sword all naked in his hand and cometh back to the place
where Perceval was, right full of anguish of heart for this that he
said, that he would war upon his mother and had reft her of this castle.
He flung his spear to the ground, and goeth toward him on foot and
dealeth him a huge buffet above the helmet upon the coif of his
habergeon, such that he cleaveth the mail and cutteth off two
fingers'-breadth of the flesh in such sort that he made him reel three
times round.

X.

When Chaos the Red felt himself wounded, he was sore grieved thereof,
and cometh toward Perceval and striketh him a great buffet above in the
midst of his helmet, so that he made the sparks fly and his neck stoop
and his eyes sparkle of stars. And the blow slippeth down on to the
shield, so that it is cleft right down to the boss. Perceval felt his
neck stiff and heavy, and feeleth that the knight is sturdy and of great
might. He cometh back towards him, and thinketh to strike him above in
the midst of his head, but Chaos swerved aside from him; howbeit
Perceval reached him and caught his right arm and cutteth it sheer from
his side, sword and all, and sendeth it flying to the ground, and Chaos
runneth upon him, thinking to grapple him with his left arm, but his
force was waning; nathless right gladly would he have avenged himself
and he might. Howbeit, Perceval setteth on him again that loved him not
in his heart, and smiteth him again above on the head, and dealeth him
such a buffet as maketh his brains be all to-scattered abroad. His
household and servants were at the windows of the hall. When they see
that their lord is nigh to the death, they cry to Perceval: "Sir, you
have slain the hardiest knight in the kingdom of Logres, and him that
was most redoubted of his enemies; but we can do no otherwise; we know
well that this castle is your mother's and ought to be yours. We
challenge it not; wherefore may you do your will of whatsoever there is
in the castle; but allow us to go to our lord that there lieth dead, and
take away the body and set it in some seemly place for the sake of his
good knighthood, and for that it behoveth us so to do."

"Readily do I grant it you," saith Perceval.

They bear the body to a chapel, then they disarm him and wind him in his
shroud. After that they lead Perceval into the hall and disarm him and
say to him: "Sir, you may be well assured that there be none but us
twain herewithin and two damsels, and the doors are barred, and behold,
here are the keys which we deliver up to you."

"And I command you," saith Perceval, "that you go straightway to my
mother, and tell her that she shall see me betimes and I may get done,
and so salute her and tell her I am sound and whole. And what is the
name of this castle?"

"Sir, it hath for name the Key of Wales, for it is the gateway of the
land."

XI\.

Perceval lay the night in the castle he had reconquered for his mother,
and the morrow, when he was armed, he departed. These promised that they
would keep the castle loyally and would deliver it up to his mother at
her will. He rode until he came to the tents where the damsels were, and
drew rein and listened. But there was not so great joy as when the
damsel that rode like a knight and led the Car came thither with
Clamados. Great dole heard he that was made, and beating of palms.
Wherefore he bethought him what folk they might be. Natheless he was not
minded to draw back without entering. He alighted in the midst of the
tents and set down his shield and his spear, and seeth the damsels
wringing their hands and tearing their hair, and much marvelleth he
wherefore it may be. A damsel cometh forward that had set forth from the
castle where he had slain the knight: "Sir, to your shame and ill
adventure may you have come hither!"

Perceval looketh at her and marvelleth much of that she saith, and she
crieth out: "Lady, behold here him that hath slain the best knight of
your lineage! And you, Clamados, that are within there, he hath slain
your father and your uncle! Now shall it be seen what you will do!"

The Damsel of the Car cometh thitherward and knoweth Perceval by the
shield that he bare of sinople with a white hart.

"Sir," saith she, "welcome may you be! Let who will make dole, I will
make joy of your coming!"

XII\.

Therewith the Damsel leadeth him into a tent and maketh him sit on a
right rich couch; afterward she maketh him be disarmed of her two
damsels and clad in a right rich robe. Then she leadeth him to the Queen
of the Tents that was still making great dole.

"Lady," saith the Damsel of the Car, "Stint your sorrow, for behold,
here is the Good Knight on whose account were the tents here pitched,
and on whose account no less have you been making this great joy right
up to this very day!"

"Ha," saith she, "Is this then the son of the Widow Lady?"

"Yea, certes," saith the Damsel.

"Ha," saith the Lady, "He hath slain me the best knight of all my kin,
and the one that protected me from mine enemies."

"Lady," saith the Damsel, "this one will be better able to protect and
defend us, for the Best Knight is he of the world and the comeliest."

The Queen taketh him by the hand and maketh him sit beside her. "Sir,"
saith she, "Howsoever the adventure may have befallen, my heart biddeth
me make joy of your coming."

"Lady," saith he, "Gramercy! Chaos would fain have slain me within his
castle, and I defended myself to my power."

The Queen looketh at him amidst his face, and is taken with a love of
him so passing strong and fervent that she goeth nigh to fall upon him.
"Sir," saith she, "and you will grant me your love, I will pardon you of
all the death of Chaos the Red."

"Lady," saith he, "your love am I right fain to deserve, and mine you
have."

"Sir," saith she, "How may I perceive that you love me?"

"Lady," saith he, "I will tell you. There is no knight in the world that
shall desire to do you a wrong, but I will help you against him to my
power."

"Such love," saith she, "is the common love that knight ought to bear to
lady. Would you do as much for another?"

"Lady," saith he, "It well may be, but more readily shall a man give
help in one place than in another."

The Queen would fain that Perceval should pledge himself to her further
than he did, and the more she looketh at him the better he pleaseth her,
and the more is she taken with him and the more desirous of his love.
But Perceval never once thought of loving her or another in such wise.
He was glad to look upon her, for that she was of passing great beauty,
but never spake he nought to her whereby she might perceive that he
loved her of inward love. But in no wise might she refrain her heart,
nor withdraw her eyes, nor lose her desire. The damsels looked upon her
with wonder that so soon had she forgotten her mourning.

XIII\.

Thereupon, behold you Clamados, that had been told that this was the
knight that, as yet only squire, had slain his father and put Chaos his
uncle to death. He cometh into the tent and seeth him sitting beside the
Queen, that looked at him right sweetly.

"Lady," saith he, "Great shame do you to yourself, in that you have
seated at your side your own mortal enemy and mine. Never again
henceforth ought any to have affiance in your love nor in your help."

"Clamados," saith the Queen, "the knight hath thrown himself upon me
suddenly. Wherefore ought I do him no evil, rather behoveth me lodge him
and keep his body in safety. Nought, moreover, hath he done whereof he
might be adjudged of murder nor of treason."

"Lady," saith Clamados, "He slew my father in the Lonely Forest without
defiance, and treacherously cast a javelin at him and smote him through
the body, wherefore shall I never be at ease until I have avenged him.
Therefore do I appeal and pray you to do me my right, not as being of
your kindred, but as stranger. For right willing am I that kinship shall
avail me nought herein."

Perceval looketh at the knight and seeth that he is of right goodly
complexion of body and right comely of face. "Fair Sir," saith he, "as
of treason I would that you hold me quit, for never toward your father
nor toward other have had I never a mind to do treason, and God defend
me from such shame, and grant me strength to clear myself of any blame
thereof."

Clamados cometh forward to proffer his gage.

"By my head," saith the Queen, "not this day shall gage be received
herein. But to-morrow will come day, and counsel therewith, and then
shall fight be done to each."

Clamados is moved of right great wrath, but the Queen of the Tents
showeth Perceval the most honour she may, whereof is Clamados right
heavy, and saith that never ought any to put his trust in woman. But
wrongly he blameth her therein, for she did it of the passing great love
she hath for Perceval, inasmuch as well she knoweth that he is the Best
Knight of the world and the comeliest. But it only irketh her the more
that she may not find in him any sign of special liking toward herself
neither in deed nor word, whereof is she beyond measure sorrowful. The
knights and damsels lay the night in the tents until the morrow, and
went to hear mass in a chapel that was in the midst of the tents.

XIV\.

When mass was sung, straightway behold you, a knight that cometh all
armed, bearing a white shield at his neck. He alighteth in the midst of
the tents and cometh before the Queen all armed, and saith: "Lady, I
plain me of a knight that is there within that hath slain my lion, and
if you do me not right herein, I will harass you as much or more than I
will him, and will harm you in every wise I may. Wherefore I pray and
require you, for the love of Messire Gawain, whose man I am, that you do
me right herein."

"What is the knight's name?" saith the Queen.

"Lady," saith he, "He is called Clamados of the Shadows, and methinketh
I see him yonder, for I knew him when he was squire."

"And what is your name?" saith the Queen.

"Lady," I am called Melior of Logres."

"Clamados," saith the Queen, "Hear you what this knight saith?"

"Yea, Lady," saith he; "But again I require that you do me right of the
knight that slew my father and my uncle."

"Lady," saith Melior, "I would fain go. I know not toward whom the
knight proffereth his gage, but him do I appeal of felony for my lion
that he hath slain." He taketh in his hand the skirt of his habergeon:
"Lady, behold here the gage I offer you."

XV\.

"Clamados," saith the Queen, "Hear you then not that which this knight
saith?"

"Lady," saith he, "I hear him well. Truth it is that I slew his lion,
but not until after he had fallen upon me, and made the wounds whereof I
have been healed herewithin. But well you know that the knight who came
hither last night hath done me greater wrong than have I done this
other. Wherefore would I pray you that I may take vengeance of him
first."

"You hear," saith she, "how this knight that hath come hither all armed
is fain to go back forthwith. Quit you, therefore, of him first, and
then will we take thought of the other."

"Lady, gramercy!" saith Meliot, "and Messire Gawain will take it in
right good part, for this knight hath slain my lion that defended me
from all my enemies. Nor is it true that the entrance to your tent was
deserted on account of my lion; and in despite of me hath he hung the
head at my gate."

"As of the lion," saith the Queen, "you have no quarrel against him and
he slew him in defending his body, but as of the despite he did you as
you say, when in nought had you done him any wrong, it shall not be that
right shalt be denied you in my court, and if you desire to deliver
battle, no blame shall you have thereof."

XVI\.

Clamados maketh arm him and mounteth on his horse, and he seemeth right
hardy of his arms and valorous. He cometh right in the midst of the
tent, where the ground was fair and level, and found Meilot of Logres
all armed upon his horse, and a right comely knight was he and a
deliver. And the ladies and damsels were round about the tilting-ground.

"Sir," saith the Queen to Perceval, "I will that you keep the field for
these knights."

"Lady," saith he, "At your pleasure."

Meliot moveth toward Clamados right swiftly and Clamados toward him, and
they melled together on their shields in such sort that they pierced
them and cleft the mail of their habergeons asunder with the points of
their spears, and the twain are both wounded so that the blood rayeth
forth of their bodies. The knights draw asunder to take their career,
for their spears were broken short, and they come back the one toward
the other with a great rush, and smite each other on the breast with
their spears so stiffly that there is none but should have been pierced
within the flesh, for the habergeons might protect them not. They hurtle
against each other so strongly that knights and horses fall together to
the ground all in a heap. The Queen and the damsels have great pity of
the two knights, for they see that they are both so passing sore
wounded. The two knights rise to their feet and hold their swords naked
and run the one on the other right wrathfully, with such force as they
had left.

"Sir," saith the Queen to Perceval, "Go part these two knights asunder
that one slay not the other, for they are sore wounded."

Perceval goeth to part them and cometh to Meliot of Logres. "Sir," saith
he, "Withdraw yourself back; you have done enough."

Clamados felt that he was sore wounded in two places, and that the wound
he had in his breast was right great. He draweth himself back. The Queen
is come thither. "Fair nephew," saith she, "Are you badly wounded?"

"Yea, Lady," saith Clamados.

"Certes," saith the Queen, "this grieveth me, but never yet saw I knight
and he were desirous of fighting, but came at some time by mischance. A
man may not always stand on all his rights."

She made him be carried on his shield into a tent, and made search his
wounds, and saw that of one had he no need to fear, but that the other
was right sore perilous.

XVII\.

"Lady," saith Clamados, "Once more do I pray and require you that you
allow not the knight that slew my father to issue forth from hence, save
he deliver good hostage that he will come back when I shall be healed."

"So will I do, sith that it is your pleasure."

The Queen cometh to the other knight that was wounded, for that he
declareth himself Messire Gawain's man, and maketh search his wounds,
and they say that he hath not been hurt so sore as is Clamados. She
commandeth them to tend him and wait upon him right well-willingly,
"Sir," saith she to Perceval, "Behoveth you abide here until such time
as my nephew be heal, for you know well that whereof he plaineth against
you, nor would I that you should depart hence without clearing you of
the blame."

"Lady, no wish have I to depart without your leave, but rather shall I
be ready to clear myself of blame whensoever and wheresoever time and
place may be. But herewithin may I make not so long sojourn. Natheless
to this will I pledge my word, that I will return thither within a term
of fifteen days from the time he shall be whole."

"Sir," saith the Damsel of the Car, "I will remain here in hostage for
you."

"But do you pray him," saith the Queen, "that he remain herewithin with
us."

XVIII\.

"Lady," saith Perceval, "I may not, for I left Lancelot wounded right
sore in my uncle's hermitage."

"Sir," saith the Queen, "I would fain that remaining here might have
pleased you as well as it would me."

"Lady," saith he, "none ought it to displease to be with you, but every
man behoveth keep his word as well as he may, and none ought to lie to
so good a knight as he."

"You promise me, then," saith the Queen, "that you will return hither
the soonest you may, or at the least, within the term appointed after
you shall have learnt that Clamados is healed, to defend you of the
treason that he layeth upon you?"

"Lady," saith he, "and if he die shall I be quit?"
