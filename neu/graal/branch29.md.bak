# The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXIX

TITLE I.

Therewithal the story is silent of Lancelot, and saith that Briant of
the Isles is repaired to Cardoil. Of the forty knights that he took with
him, but fifteen doth he bring back again. Thereof is King Arthur right
sorrowful, and saith that he hath the fewer friends. They of the land of
Albanie have sent to King Arthur and told him that and he would not lose
the land for evermore he must send them Lancelot, for never saw they
knight that better knew how to avenge him on his enemies and to do them
hurt than was he. The King asketh Briant of the Isles how it is that his
knights are dead in such sort?

"Sir," saith Briant, "Madeglant hath great force of people, and what
force of men soever may run upon them, they make a castle of their navy
in such sort that none may endure against them, and never did no folk
know so much of war as do they. The land lieth far away from you, and
more will it cost you to hold it than it is worth; and, if you will
believe my counsel, you will trouble yourself no more about it, and they
of the country would be well counselled and they did the same."

"Briant," saith the King, "This would be great blame to myself. No
worshipful man ought to be idle in guarding and holding that which is
his own. The worshipful man ought not to hold of things so much for
their value as for their honour, and if I should leave the land
disgarnished of my aid and my counsel, they will take mine, and will say
that I have not heart to protect my land; and even now is it great shame
to myself that they have settled themselves there and would fain draw
away them of the land to their evil law. And I would fain that Lancelot
had achieved that he hath undertaken, and I would have sent him there,
for none would protect the land better than he, and, were he now there
along with forty knights and with them of the country, Madeglant would
make but short stay there."

"Sir," saith Briant, "They of the country reckon nought of you nor any
other but Lancelot only, and they say that and you send him there they
will make him King."

"It may well be that they say so," saith the King, "But never would
Lancelot do aught that should be against my will."

"Sir," saith Briant, "Sith that you are not minded to believe me, I will
say no more in this matter, but in the end his knighthood will harm you
rather than help you and you take no better heed thereof than up to this
time you have done."
