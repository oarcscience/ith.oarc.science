# CHAPTER IV: DRACHENFELS TO RHEINSTEIN

### The Dragon's Rock

Among the many legends invented by the early Christian monks to advance
their faith, there are few more beautiful than that attached to the
Drachenfels, the Dragon's Rock, a rugged and picturesque mass of
volcanic porphyry rising above the Rhine on its right bank. Half-way up
one of its pointed crags is a dark cavern known as the 'Dragon's Cave,'
which was at one time, in that misty past to which all legends belong,
the habitation of a hideous monster, half-beast and half-reptile. The
peasants of the surrounding district held the creature in superstitious
awe, worshipped him, and offered up sacrifices of human beings at the
instigation of their pagan priests. Foremost among the worshippers of
the dragon were two warrior princes, Rinbod and Horsrik, who frequently
made an onslaught on the Christian people dwelling on the opposite bank
of the Rhine, carrying off many captives to be offered as sacrifices to
the dragon.

On one such occasion, while, according to their custom, they were
dividing their prisoners, the pagan princes quarrelled over one of their
captives, a Christian maiden, whose beauty and helpless innocence won
the hearts of her fierce captors, so that each desired to possess her,
and neither was inclined to renounce his claim. The quarrel became so
bitter at length that the princes seized their weapons and were about to
fight for the fair spoil. But at this juncture their priests intervened.

"It is not meet," said they, "that two noble princes should come to
blows over a mere Christian maid. Tomorrow she shall be offered to the
dragon, in thanksgiving

for your victory." And they felt that they had done well, for had they
not averted the impending quarrel, and at the same time gained a victim
for their cruel rites? But the heart of Rinbod was heavy indeed, for he
truly loved the young Christian maid, and would have given his life to
save her from the horrible fate that awaited her. However, the decree of
the priests was irrevocable, and no pleadings of his could avail. The
girl was informed of the cruel destiny that was to befall her on the
morrow, and with a calm mind she sought consolation from Heaven to
enable her to meet her fate with courage befitting a Christian.

Early on the following morning she was led with much ceremony to a spot
before the Dragon's Cave and there bound to an oak, to await the
approach of the monster, whose custom it was to sally forth at sunrise
in search of prey. The procession of priests, warriors, and peasants who
had followed the victim to the place of sacrifice now climbed to the
summit of the crag and watched eagerly for the coming of the dragon.
Rinbod watched also, but it was with eyes full of anguish and
apprehension. The Christian maid seemed to him more like a spirit than a
human being, so calmly, so steadfastly did she bear herself.

Suddenly a stifled cry broke from the lips of the watchers--the hideous
monster was seen dragging its heavy coils from the cavern, fire issuing
from its mouth and nostrils. At its mighty roar even the bravest
trembled. But the Christian maid alone showed no sign of fear; she
awaited the oncoming of the dreadful creature with a hymn of praise on
her lips. Nearer and nearer came the dragon, and at length, with a
horrible roar, it sprang at its prey. But even as it did so the maiden
held out her crucifix

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

before her, and the dragon was checked in its onrush. A moment later it
turned aside and plunged into the Rhine. The people on the crag were
filled with awe at the miraculous power of the strange symbol which had
overcome their idol and, descending, hastened to free the young girl
from her bonds. When they learned the significance of the cross they
begged that she would send them teachers that they might learn about the
new religion. In vain their priests endeavoured to dissuade them. They
had seen the power of the crucifix, and their renunciation of their
pagan creed was complete.

Among the first to adopt the Christian religion was Rinbod; he married
the beautiful captive and built a castle for her on the Drachenfels,
whose ruins remain to this day.

It seems a pity that such a beautiful legend should have doubts cast
upon its authenticity, but it has been conjectured that the word
Drachenfels has a geological rather than a romantic significance--being,
in fact, derived from *Trachyt-fels*, meaning 'Trachyte-rock.' This view
is supported by the fact that there is another Drachenfels near Mannheim
of a similar geological construction, but without the legend. However,
it is unlikely that the people of antiquity would bestow a geological
name upon any locality.

### Okkenfels: A Rash Oath

On a rugged crag overlooking the Rhine above the town of Linz stands the
ruined stronghold of Okkenfels. History tells us little or nothing
concerning this ancient fortress, but legend covers the deficiency with
the tale of the Baron's Rash Oath.

Rheinhard von Renneberg, according to the story,

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

flourished about the beginning of the eleventh century, when the Schloss
Okkenfels was a favourite rendezvous with the rude nobility of the
surrounding district. Though they were none of them distinguished for
their manners, by far the most rugged and uncouth was the Baron von
Renneberg himself. Rough in appearance, abrupt in conversation, and
inclined to harshness in all his dealings, he inspired in the breast of
his only daughter a feeling more akin to awe than affection.

The gentle Etelina grew up to be a maiden of singular beauty, of
delicate form and feature, and under the careful tutelage of the castle
chaplain she became as good as she was beautiful. Lovers she had in
plenty, for the charms of Etelina and the wealth of her noble father,
whose sole heiress she was, formed a combination quite irresistible in
the eyes of the young gallants who frequented the castle. But none loved
her more sincerely than one of the baron's retainers, a young knight of
Linz, Rudolph by name.

On one occasion Rheinhard was obliged to set out with his troop to join
the wars in Italy, and ere he departed he confided his daughter to the
care of the venerable chaplain, while his castle and lands he left in
charge of Sir Rudolph. As may be supposed, the knight and the maiden
frequently met, and ere long it became evident that Rudolph's passion
was returned. The worthy chaplain, who loved the youth as a son, did not
seek to interfere with the course of his wooing, and so in due time the
lovers were betrothed.

At the end of a year the alarming news reached them that the baron was
returning from the wars, bringing in his train a noble bridegroom for
Etelina. In despair the lovers sought the old chaplain and begged his
advice.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They knew only too
well that the baron would not brook resistance to his will; for he had
ever dealt ruthlessly with opposition. Yet both were determined that
nothing should part them.

"I would rather die with Rudolph than marry another," cried the
grief-stricken maiden. And indeed it seemed that one or other of these
alternatives would soon fall to her lot.

But the wise old priest was planning a way of escape.

"Ye were meant for one another, my children," he said philosophically;
"therefore it is not for man to separate you. I will marry you at once,
and I know a place where you may safely hide for a season."

It was nearing midnight on the eve of the day fixed for Rheinhard's
return, so there was no time to be lost. The three repaired to the
chapel, where the marriage was at once solemnized. Taking a basket of
bread, meat, and wine, a lamp, and some other necessaries, the old man
conducted the newly married pair through a subterranean passage to a
cavern in the rock whereon the castle stood, a place known only to
himself. Then, having blessed them, he withdrew.

Early on the following morning came the baron and his train, with the
noble knight chosen as a husband for Etelina.

Rheinhard looked in vain for his daughter among the crowd of retainers
who waited to welcome him. "Where is my little maid?" he asked.

The chaplain answered evasively. The damsel was ill abed, he replied.
When the noble lord had refreshed himself he should see her.

Directly the repast was over he hastened to his daughter's apartment,
only to find her flown! Dismayed and angry,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

he rushed to the chaplain and demanded an explanation. The good old man,
after a vain attempt to soothe his irate patron, revealed all--all, that
is, save the place where the fugitives were concealed, and that he
firmly refused to divulge. The priest was committed to the lowest
dungeon, a vile den to which access could only be got by means of a
trap-door and a rope.

With his own hands the baron swung to the massive trap, swearing a deep
oath.

"If I forgive my daughter, or any of her accomplices, may I die suddenly
where I now stand, and may my soul perish for ever!"

The disappointed bridegroom soon returned to his own land, and the
baron, whose increasing moroseness made him cordially hated by his
attendants, was left to the bitterness of his thoughts.

Meanwhile Rudolph and his bride had escaped unseen from the castle rock
and now dwelt in the forests skirting the Seven Mountains. While the
summer lasted all went well with them; they, and the little son who was
born to them, were content with the sustenance the forest afforded. But
in the winter all was changed. Starvation stared them in the face. More
and more pitiful became their condition, till at length Rudolph resolved
to seek the baron, and give his life, if need be, to save his wife and
child.

That very day Rheinhard was out hunting in the forest. Imagine his
surprise when a gaunt figure, clad in a bearskin, stepped from the
undergrowth and bade him follow, if he wished to see his daughter alive.
The startled old man obeyed the summons, and arrived at length before a
spacious cavern, which his guide motioned him to enter. Within, on a
pile of damp leaves, lay Etelina and her child, both half-dead with
starvation. Rheinhard's anger

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

speedily melted at the pathetic sight, and he freely forgave his
daughter and Rudolph, his hitherto unrecognized guide, and bade them
return with him to Okkenfels.

Etelina's first request was for a pardon for the old chaplain, and
Rheinhard himself went to raise the heavy trap-door. While peering into
the gloom, however, he stumbled and fell headlong into the dungeon
below. "A judgment!" he shrieked as he fell, then all was silence.

The bruised remains of the proud baron were interred in the parish
church of Linz, and henceforth Etelina and her husband lived happily at
Okkenfels. But both they and the old chaplain offered many a pious
prayer for the soul of the unhappy Baron Rheinhard.

### Oberwörth

In the middle of the Rhine, a little above Coblentz, lies the island of
Oberwörth, where at one time stood a famous nunnery. Included in the
traditional lore of the neighbourhood is a tragic tale of the beautiful
Ida, daughter of the Freiherr von Metternich, who died within its walls
in the fourteenth century.

Von Metternich, who dwelt at Coblentz, was a wealthy and powerful noble,
exceedingly proud of his fair daughter, and firmly convinced that none
but the highest in the land was fit mate for her. But Ida had other
views, and had already bestowed her heart on a young squire in her
father's train. It is true that Gerbert was a high-born youth, of
stainless life, pleasing appearance, and gentle manners, and, moreover,
one who was likely at no distant date to win his spurs. Nevertheless the
lovers instinctively concealed their mutual affection from von
Metternich, and plighted their troth in secret.

But so ardent an affection could not long remain hidden.

 

<span id="img_15800"></span>

SCHLOSS LAHNECK  
LOUIS WEIRTER, R.B.A.  
*Facing page 158*.  

 

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The time came when
the nobleman discovered how matters stood between his daughter and
Gerbert, and with angry frowns and muttered oaths he resolved to
exercise his paternal authority. "My daughter shall go to a nunnery," he
said to himself. "And as for that jackanapes, he must be got rid of at
once." He pondered how he might conveniently rid himself of the
audacious squire.

That night he dispatched Gerbert on a mission to the grand prior of the
Knights-Templars, who had his abode at the neighbouring castle of
Lahneck. The unsuspecting squire took the sealed missive and set out,
thinking as he rode along how rich he was in possessing so sweet a love
as Ida, and dreaming of the time when his valour and prowess should have
made their marriage possible. But his dreams would have been rudely
disturbed had he seen what was passing at Coblentz. For his betrothed,
in spite of her tears and pleadings, was being secretly conveyed to the
nunnery of Oberwörth, there to remain until she should have forgotten
her lover--as though the stone walls of a convent could shut out the
imaginings of a maid! However, Gerbert knew nothing of this, and he rode
along in leisurely fashion, until at length he came to the Schloss
Lahneck, where he was at once conducted into the presence of the grand
prior of the Knights-Templars.

The grand prior was a man of middle age, with an expression of settled
melancholy on his swarthy features. Gerbert approached him with becoming
reverence, bent his knee, and presented the missive.

The prior turned his gaze so earnestly on the young man's face that
Gerbert dropped his eyes in confusion. A moment later the prior broke
the seal and hastily scanned the letter.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

"Who mayest thou be, youth?" he asked abruptly.

"Gerbert von Isenburg, sir."

"And thy mother?"

"Guba von Isenburg," was the astonished Gerbert's reply.

The prior seemed to be struggling with deep emotion.

"Knowest thou the purport of this missive?" he said at last.

"It concerns me not," answered Gerbert simply.

"Nay, my son," said the prior, "it doth concern thee, and deeply, too.
Know that it is thy death-warrant, boy! The Freiherr has requested me to
send thee to the wars in Palestine, and so to place thee that death will
be a certainty. This he asks in the name of our ancient friendship and
for the sake of our order, to which he has ever shown himself well
disposed."

Seeing the dismay and incredulity which were depicted in his listener's
face, the prior hastened to read aloud a passage describing von
Metternich's discovery of his daughter's love for the humble squire, and
Gerbert could no longer doubt that his fate was sealed.

The prior looked at him kindly.

"Gerbert," he said, "I am not going to put the cruel order into
execution. Though I lose friendship, the honour of our order, life
itself, the son of Guba von Isenburg shall not suffer at my hands. I
sympathize with thy passion for the fair Ida. I myself loved thy
mother." The impetuous Gerbert started to his feet, hand on sword, at
the mention of his mother, whose good name he set before all else; but
with a dignified gesture the prior motioned him to his seat.

Then in terse, passionate phrases the elder man told how he had loved
the gentle Guba for years, always hesitating

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

to declare his passion lest the lady should scorn him. At length he
could bear it no longer, and made up his mind to reveal his love to her.
With this intent he rode toward her home, only to learn from a passing
page that Guba, his mistress, was to be married that very day to von
Isenburg. He gave to the page a ring, bidding him carry it to his
mistress with the message that it was from one who loved her greatly,
and who for her sake renounced the world.

"The ring," he concluded, "is on thy finger, and in thy face and voice
are thy mother's likeness. Canst thou wonder that I would spare thy
life?"

Gerbert listened in respectful silence. His love for Ida enabled him to
sympathize with the pathetic tale unfolded by the prior. Tears fell
unchecked from the eyes of both. "And now," said the prior at last, "we
must look to thy safety."

"I would not bring misfortune on thee," said Gerbert. "May I not go to
Palestine and win my way through with my sword?"

"It is impossible," said the elder man. "Von Metternich would see to it
that thou wert slain. Thou must go to Swabia, where a prior of our order
will look after thy safety in the meantime."

The same day Gerbert was conveyed to Swabia, where, for a time at least,
he was safe from persecution.

### The Dance of Death

In the nunnery of Oberwörth, on a pallet in a humble cell, Ida lay
dying. A year had gone past since she had been separated from her lover,
and every day had seen her grow weaker and more despondent. Forget
Gerbert? That would she never while life remained to her. Wearily she
tossed on her pallet, her only companion a sister of

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

the convent. Willingly now would the Freiherr give his dearest
possessions to save his daughter, but already she was beyond assistance,
her only hope the peace of the grave.

"I am dying, sister," she said to her attendant. "Nevermore shall I see
my dear Gerbert--ah! nevermore."

"Hush," murmured the nun gently, "stranger things have happened. All may
yet be well." And to divert the dying maid's attention from her grief
she recited tales of lovers who had been reunited after many
difficulties.

But Ida refused to be pacified.

"Alas!" she said, "I am betrothed, yet I must die unwed."

"Heaven forbid!" cried the pious nun in alarm. "For then must thou join
in the dance of death."

It was a popular belief in that district that a betrothed maiden who
died before her wedding was celebrated must, after her death, dance on a
spot in the centre of the island whereon no grass or herb ever
grew--that is, unless in the interval she took the veil. Every night at
twelve o'clock a band of such hapless maidens may be seen dancing in the
moonlight, doomed to continue their nocturnal revels till they meet with
a lover. And woe betide the knight who ventures within their reach! They
dance round and round him and with him till he falls dead, whereupon the
youngest maid claims him for her lover. Henceforth she rests quietly in
her grave and joins no more in the ghostly frolic.

This weird tradition Ida now heard from the lips of the nun, who herself
claimed to have witnessed the scenes she described.

"I beseech thee," said the sister, "do but join our convent, and all
will yet be well."

"I die," murmured Ida, heeding not the words of her companion.
"Gerbert--we shall meet again!"

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Gerbert, her lover, heard the sad news in his dwelling-place on the
shores of Lake Constance, and returned to Oberwörth with all speed. A
week had elapsed ere he arrived, and Ida's body was already interred in
the vaults of the convent.

It was a night of storm and darkness. No boatman would venture on the
Rhine, but Gerbert, anxious to pay the last respects to the body of his
beloved, was not to be deterred. With his own hands he unmoored a vessel
and sailed across to Oberwörth. Having landed at that part of the island
furthest from the convent, he was obliged to pass the haunted spot on
his way thither. The circular patch of barren earth was said to be a
spot accursed, by reason of sacrilege and suicide committed there. But
such things were far from the thoughts of the distraught knight.

Suddenly he heard a strange sound, like the whisper of a familiar
voice--a sound which, despite its quietness, seemed to make itself heard
above the fury of the storm. Looking up, he beheld a band of white-robed
maidens dancing in the charmed circle. One of them, a little apart from
the others, seemed to him to be his lost Ida. The familiar figure, the
grace of mien, the very gesture with which she beckoned him, were hers,
and he rushed forward to clasp her to his heart. Adroitly she eluded his
grasp and mingled with the throng. Gerbert followed with bursting heart,
seized her in his arms, and found that the other phantoms had surrounded
them. Something in the unearthly music fascinated him; he felt impelled
to dance round and round, till his head reeled. And still he danced with
his phantom bride, and still the maidens whirled about them. On the
stroke of one the dancers vanished and the knight sank to the ground,
all but dead with fatigue. In the morning he was found by the kindly
nuns, who

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

tended him carefully. But all their skill and attention were in vain;
for Gerbert lived only long enough to tell of his adventure to the
sisterhood. This done, he expired with the name of his beloved
spirit-bride upon his lips.

### Stolzenfels: The Alchemist

Alchemy was a common pursuit in the Middle Ages. The poor followed it
eagerly in the vain desire for gold; the rich spent their wealth in
useless experiments, or showered it on worthless charlatans.

Thus it came about that Archbishop Werner of Falkenstein, owner of the
grim fortress of Stolzenfels and a wealthy and powerful Churchman, was
an amateur of the hermetic art, while his Treasurer, who was by no means
rich, was also by way of being an alchemist. To indulge his passion for
the bizarre science the latter had extracted many a golden piece from
the coffers of his reverend master, always meaning, of course, to pay
them back when the weary experiments should have crystallized into the
coveted philosopher's stone. He had in his daughter Elizabeth a treasure
which might well have outweighed the whole of the Archbishop's coffers,
but the lust for gold had blinded the covetous Treasurer to all else.

One night--a wild, stormy night, when the wind tore shrieking round the
battlements of Stolzenfels--there came to the gate a pilgrim, sombre of
feature as of garb, with wicked, glinting eyes. The Archbishop was not
at that time resident in the castle, but his Treasurer, hearing that the
new-comer was learned in alchemical mysteries, bade him enter without
delay. A room was made ready in one of the highest towers, and there the
Treasurer and his pilgrim friend spent many days and nights. Elizabeth
saw with dismay that a change was coming over her

 

<span id="img_16400"></span>

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

father. He was no longer gentle and kind, but morose and reserved, and
he passed less time in her company than he was wont.

At length a courier arrived with tidings of the approach of the
Archbishop, who was bringing some noble guests to the castle. To the
dismay of his daughter, the Treasurer suddenly turned pale and, brushing
aside her solicitous inquiries, fled to the mysterious chamber.
Elizabeth followed, convinced that something had occurred to upset her
father seriously. She was too late--the door was locked ere she reached
it; but she could hear angry voices within, the voices of her father and
the pilgrim. The Treasurer seemed to be uttering bitter reproaches,
while ever and anon the deep, level voice of his companion could be
heard.

"Bring hither a virgin," he said. "The heart's blood of a virgin is
necessary to our schemes, as I have told thee many times. How can I give
thee gold, and thou wilt not obey my instructions?"

"Villain!" cried the Treasurer, beside himself. "Thou hast taken my
gold, thou hast made me take the gold of my master also for thy schemes.
Wouldst thou have me shed innocent blood?"

"I tell thee again, without it our experiments are vain."

At that moment the door was flung open and the Treasurer emerged, too
immersed in his anxious thoughts to perceive the shrinking form of
Elizabeth. She, when he had gone from sight, entered the chamber where
stood the pilgrim.

"I have heard thy conversation," she said, "and I am ready to give my
life for my father's welfare. Tell me what I must do and I will slay me
with mine own hand."

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

With covetous glance the pilgrim advanced and strove to take her hand,
but she shrank back in loathing.

"Touch me not," she said, shuddering.

A look of malice overspread the pilgrim's averted face.

"Come hither at midnight, and at sunrise thy father will be rich and
honoured," he said.

"Wilt thou swear it on the cross?"

"I swear it," he returned, drawing a little crucifix from his bosom, and
speaking in solemn tones.

"Very well, I promise." And with that she withdrew.

When she had gone the alchemist pressed a spring in the crucifix, when a
dagger fell out.

"Thou hast served me well," he said, chuckling. Then, replacing the
crucifix in his breast, he entered the adjoining room, prised up a stone
from the floor, and drew forth a leathern bag full of gold. This, then,
was the crucible into which the Archbishop's pieces had gone. "I have
found the secret of making gold," pursued the pilgrim. "To-morrow my
wealth and I will be far away in safety. The fools, to seek gold in a
crucible!"

Meanwhile preparations were afoot for the reception of the Archbishop.
Elizabeth, full of grief and determination, supervised the work of the
serving-maids, while her father anxiously wondered how he should account
to his master for the stolen pieces of gold.

The Archbishop was loudly hailed on his arrival. He greeted his
Treasurer kindly and asked after the pretty Elizabeth. When her father
presented her he in turn introduced her to his guests, and many a glance
of admiration was directed at the gentle maid. One young knight, in
particular, was so smitten with her charms that he was dumb the whole
evening.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

When Elizabeth retired to her chamber her father bade her good-night.
Hope had again arisen in his breast.

"To-morrow," he said, "my troubles will be over." Elizabeth sighed.

At length the hour of midnight arrived. Taking a lamp, the girl crossed
the courtyard to where the alchemist awaited her coming. She was not
unseen, however; the young knight had been watching her window, and he
observed her pass through the courtyard with surprise. Fearing he knew
not what harm to the maid he loved, he followed her to the pilgrim's
apartment, and there watched her through a crack in the door.

The alchemist was bending over a crucible when Elizabeth entered.

"Ah, thou hast come," he said. "I hope thou art prepared to do as I bid
thee? If that is so, I will restore the gold to thy father--his own gold
and his master's. If thou art willing to sacrifice thine honour, thy
father's honour shall be restored; if thy life, he shall have the money
he needs."

"Away, wretch!" cried Elizabeth indignantly. "I will give my life for my
father, but I will not suffer insult." With a shrug of his shoulders the
alchemist turned to his crucible.

"As thou wilt," he said. "Prepare for the sacrifice."

Suddenly the kneeling maid caught up the alchemist's dagger and would
have plunged it into her heart; but ere she could carry out her purpose
the knight burst open the door, rushed into the room, and seized the
weapon. Elizabeth, overcome with the relief which his opportune arrival
afforded her, fainted in his arms.

While the young man frantically sought means to restore her the pilgrim
seized the opportunity to escape, and

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

when the maid came to herself it was to find the wretch gone and herself
supported by a handsome young knight, who was pouring impassioned
speeches into her ear. His love and tenderness awakened an answering
emotion in her heart, and that very night they were betrothed.

When the maiden's father was apprised of her recent peril he, too, was
grateful to her deliverer, and yet more grateful when his future
son-in-law pressed him to make use of his ample fortune.

The pilgrim was found drowned in the Rhine, and the bag of gold, which
he had carried away in his belt, was handed over to the Archbishop, to
whom the Treasurer confessed all.

And the good Archbishop, by way of confirming his forgiveness, gave a
handsome present to Elizabeth on her marriage with the knight.

### The Legend of Boppard

Maidens had curious ways of revenging themselves on unfaithful lovers in
medieval times, as the following legend of Boppard would show.

Toward the end of the twelfth century there dwelt in Boppard a knight
named Sir Conrad Bayer, brave, generous, and a good comrade, but not
without his faults, as will be seen hereafter.

At that time many brave knights and nobles were fighting in the Third
Crusade under Frederick the First and Richard Cœur-de-Lion; but Sir
Conrad still remained at Boppard. He gave out that the reason for his
remaining at home was to protect his stronghold against a horde of
robbers who infested the neighbourhood. But there were those who
ascribed his reluctance to depart to another cause. In a neighbouring
fortress there lived a beautiful maiden,

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Maria by name, who
received a great deal of attention from Sir Conrad. So frequent were his
visits to her home that rumour had it that the fair lady had won his
heart. This indeed was the case, and she in return had given her love
unreservedly into his keeping. But as her passion grew stronger his
seemed to cool, and at length he began to make preparations to join the
wars in Palestine, leaving the lady to lament his changed demeanour. In
vain she pleaded, in vain she sent letters to him. At last he intimated
plainly that he loved her no longer. He did not intend to marry, he
said, adding cruelly that if he did she should not be the bride of his
choice. The lady was completely crushed by the blow. Her affection for
Sir Conrad perished, and in its place arose a desire to be revenged on
the unfaithful knight. The fickle lover had completed his arrangements
for his journey to the Holy Land, and all was ready for his departure.
As he rode gaily down from his castle to where his men-at-arms waited on
the shores of the Rhine, he was suddenly confronted by an armed knight,
who reined in his steed and bade Sir Conrad halt.

"Hold, Sir Conrad Bayer," he cried. "Thou goest not hence till thou hast
answered for thy misdeeds--thou false knight--thou traitor!"

Sir Conrad listened in astonishment. A moment later his attendants had
surrounded the bold youth, and would have slain him had not Sir Conrad
interfered.

"Back!" he said. "Let me face this braggart myself. Who art thou?" he
added, addressing the young knight who had thus boldly challenged him.

"One who would have thy life!" was the fierce reply.

"Why should I slay thee, bold youth?" said Conrad, amused.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

"I am the brother of Maria, whom thou hast betrayed," was the response.
"I have come hither from Palestine to seek thy life. Have at thee,
traitor!"

Conrad, somewhat sobered, and unwilling to do battle with such a boy,
asked for further proof of his identity. The young knight thereupon
displayed, blazoned on his shield, the arms of his house--a golden lion
on an azure field.

Sir Conrad had no longer excuse for refusing to do battle with the
youth, so with a muttered "Thy blood be upon thy head!" he laid his
lance in rest and drew back a few paces. The stranger did likewise; then
they rushed toward each other, and such was the force of their impact
that both were unhorsed. Drawing their swords--for neither was
injured--the knights resumed the conflict on foot. Conrad felt disgraced
at having been unhorsed by a mere youth, and he was now further incensed
by receiving a deep wound in his arm. Henceforth he fought in good
earnest, showering blows on his antagonist, who fell at last, mortally
wounded.

In obedience to the rules of chivalry, Sir Conrad hastened to assist his
vanquished foe. What was his surprise, his horror, when, on raising the
head and unlacing the helm of the knight, he found that his adversary
was none other than Maria!

"Conrad," she said in failing tones, "I also am to blame. Without thy
love life was nothing to me, and I resolved to die by thy hand. Forget
my folly, remember only that I loved thee. Farewell!" And with these
words she expired. Conrad flung himself down by her side, convulsed with
grief and remorse. From that hour a change came over him. Ere he set out
to the Holy Land he caused the body of Maria to be interred on the
summit of the Kreuzberg,

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

and bestowed the greater part of his estates on a pious brotherhood,
enjoining them to raise a nunnery over the tomb. Thus was the convent of
Marienberg founded, and in time it came to be one of the richest and
most celebrated on the Rhine.

Arrived in Palestine, Conrad became a Knight-Templar, fighting bravely
and utterly oblivious to all danger. It was not until Acre had been won,
however, that death met him. An arrow dispatched by an unknown hand
found its quarry as he was walking the ramparts at night meditating on
the lady he had slain and whose death had restored her to a place in his
affections.

### Liebenstein and Sterrenberg

Near the famous monastery of Bornhofen, and not far from the town of
Camp, supposed to be an ancient Roman site, are the celebrated castles
of Liebenstein and Sterrenberg, called 'the Brothers,' perhaps because
of their contiguity to each other rather than through the legend
connected with the name. History is practically silent concerning these
towers, which occupy two steep crags united by a small isthmus which has
partially been cut through. Sterrenberg lies nearest the north,
Liebenstein to the south. A wooden bridge leads from one to the other,
but a high wall called the Schildmauer was in the old days reared
between them, obviously with the intention of cutting off communication.
The legend has undoubtedly become sophisticated by literary influences,
and was so altered by one Joseph Kugelgen as to change its purport
entirely. It is the modern version of the legend we give here, in
contradistinction to that given in the chapter on the Folklore and
Literature of the Rhine (see pp. [84](lr06.htm#page_84) *et seq*..md).

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

### The Brothers

Heinrich and Conrad were the sons of Kurt, a brave knight who had
retired from the wars, and now dwelt in his ancestral castle
Liebenstein. The brothers were alike in all matters pertaining to arms
and chivalry. But otherwise they differed, for Heinrich, the elder, was
quiet and more given to the arts of peace; whereas Conrad was gay, and
inclined to like fighting for fighting's sake.

Brought up along with them was Hildegarde, a relative and an orphan,
whom the brothers believed to be their sister. On reaching manhood,
however, their father told them the truth concerning her, expressing the
wish that one of them should marry the maiden.

Nothing loath, both brothers wooed Hildegarde, but Conrad's ardent,
impulsive nature triumphed over Heinrich's reserved and more steadfast
affection. In due course preparations were made for the marriage
festival, and a new castle, Sterrenberg, was raised for the young couple
adjacent to Liebenstein. Heinrich found it hard to be a constant witness
of his brother's happiness, so he set out for the Holy Land. Soon after
his departure the old knight became ill, and died on the day that the
new castle was completed. This delayed the marriage for a year, and as
the months passed Conrad became associated with loose companions, and
his love for Hildegarde weakened.

Meantime news came that Heinrich had performed marvellous deeds in the
Holy Land, and the tidings inflamed Conrad's zeal. He, too, determined
to join the Crusades, and was soon on the way to Palestine.

However, he did not, like his brother, gain renown--for

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

he had not the same incentive to reckless bravery--and he soon returned.
He was again to prove himself more successful in love than in war, for
at Constantinople, having fallen passionately in love with a beautiful
Greek lady, he married her.

One day Hildegarde was sitting sorrowful in her chamber, when she beheld
travellers with baggage moving into the empty Sterrenberg. Greatly
astonished, she sent her waiting-maid to make inquiries, and learned to
her sorrow that it was the returning Conrad, who came bringing with him
a Greek wife. Conrad avoided Liebenstein, and Sterrenberg became gay
with feasting and music.

Late one evening a knight demanded lodging at Liebenstein and was
admitted. The stranger was Heinrich, who, hearing about his brother's
shameful marriage, had returned to the grief-stricken Hildegarde.

After he had rested Heinrich sent a message to his brother reproaching
him with unknightly behaviour, and challenging him to mortal combat. The
challenge was accepted and the combatants met on the passage separating
the two castles. But as they faced each other, sword in hand, a veiled
female figure stepped between them and bade them desist.

It was Hildegarde, who had recognized Heinrich and learned his
intention. In impassioned tones she urged the young men not to be guilty
of the folly of shedding each other's blood in such a cause, and
declared that it was her firm intention to spend her remaining days in a
convent. The brothers submitted themselves to her persuasion and became
reconciled. Some time afterward Conrad's wife proved her unworthiness by
eloping with a young knight, thus killing her husband's love for her,
and at the same time opening his eyes to his own base conduct. Bitterly

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

now did he reproach himself for his unfaithfulness to Hildegarde, who,
alas! was now lost to him for ever.

Hildegarde remained faithful to her vows, and Heinrich and Conrad lived
together till at last death separated them.

### St. Goar

Near the town of St. Goar, at the foot of the Rheinfels, there stands a
little cell, once the habitation of a pious hermit known as St. Goar,
and many are the local traditions which tell of the miracles wrought by
this good man, and the marvellous virtues retained by his shrine after
his death. He settled on Rhenish shores, we are told, about the middle
of the sixth century, and thenceforward devoted his life to the service
of the rude people among whom his lot was cast. His first care was to
instruct them in the Christian faith, but he was also mindful of their
welfare in temporal matters, and gave his services freely to the sick
and sorrowful, so that ere long he came to be regarded as a saint. When
he was not employed in prayer and ministrations he watched the currents
of the Rhine, and was ever willing to lend his aid to distressed
mariners who had been caught by the *Sand Gewirr*, a dangerous eddy
which was too often the death of unwary boatmen in these parts.

Thus he spent an active and cheerful life, far from the envy and strife
of the world, for which he had no taste whatever. Nevertheless the fame
of his good deeds had reached the high places of the earth. Sigebert,
who at that time held his court at Andernach, heard of the piety and
noble life of the hermit, and invited him to his palace. St. Goar
accepted the invitation--or, rather, obeyed the command--and made his
way to Andernach. He was

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

well received by the monarch, whom his genuine holiness and
single-mindedness greatly impressed. But pure as he was, the worthy Goar
was not destined to escape calumny. There were at the court of Sigebert
other ecclesiastics of a less exalted type, and these were filled with
envy and indignation when they beheld the favours bestowed upon the
erstwhile recluse. Foremost among his persecutors was the Archbishop of
Treves, and with him Sigebert dealt in summary fashion, depriving him of
his archbishopric and offering the see to St. Goar. The latter, however,
was sick of the perpetual intrigues and squabblings of the court, and
longed to return to the shelter of his mossy cell and the sincere
friendship of the poor fishermen among whom his mission lay. So he
refused the proffered dignity and informed the monarch of his desire to
return home. As he stood in the hall of the palace preparing to take his
leave, he threw his cloak over a sunbeam, and, strange to say, the
garment was suspended as though the shaft of light were solid. This, we
are told, was not a mere piece of bravado, but was done to show that the
saint's action in refusing the see was prompted by divine inspiration.

When St. Goar died Sigebert caused a chapel to be erected over his
grave, choosing from among his disciples two worthy monks to officiate.
Other hermits took up their abode near the spot, and all were
subsequently gathered together in a monastery. The grave of the solitary
became a favourite shrine, to which pilgrims travelled from all
quarters, and St. Goar became the patron saint of hospitality, not so
much personally as through the monastery of which he was the patron, and
one of whose rules was that no stranger should be denied hospitality for
a certain period.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

A goodly number of stories are told of his somewhat drastic treatment of
those who passed by his shrine without bringing an offering--stories
which may be traced to the monks who dwelt there, and who reaped the
benefit of these offerings.

### Charlemagne at the Shrine of St. Goar

Here is one of those tales concerning the great Karl. On one occasion
while he was travelling from Ingelheim to Aix-la-Chapelle, by way of
Coblentz, he passed the shrine of St. Goar without so much as a single
thought. Nor did those who accompanied him give the saint more
attention. It was the height of summer, everything was bright and
beautiful, and as the Emperor's flotilla drifted lazily down the Rhine
the sound of laughter and light jesting could be heard.

No sooner had the Emperor and his courtiers passed St. Goar, however,
than the smiling sky became overcast, heavy clouds gathered, and the
distant sound of thunder was heard. A moment more and they were in the
midst of a raging storm; water surged and boiled all around, and
darkness fell so thickly that scarce could one see another's face. Panic
reigned supreme where all had been gaiety and merriment.

In vain the sailors strove to reach the shore; in vain the ladies
shrieked and the Emperor and his nobles lent their aid to the seamen.
All the exertions of the sailors would not suffice to move the vessels
one foot nearer the shore. At length an old boatman who had spent the
greater part of a lifetime on the Rhine approached the Emperor and
addressed him thus:

"Sire, our labours are useless. We have offended God and St. Goar."

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

The words were repeated by the Emperor's panic-stricken train, who now
saw that the storm was of miraculous origin. "Let us go ashore," said
Charlemagne in an awed voice. "In the name of God and St. Goar, let us
go ashore. We will pray at the shrine of the saint that he may help us
make peace with Heaven."

Scarcely had he uttered the words ere the sky began to clear, the
boiling water subsided to its former glassy smoothness, and the storm
was over. The illustrious company landed and sought the shrine of the
holy man, where they spent the rest of the day in prayer.

Ere they departed on the following morning Charlemagne and his court
presented rich offerings at the shrine, and the Emperor afterward
endowed the monastery with lands of great extent, by which means it is
to be hoped that he succeeded in propitiating the jealous saint.

### The Reconciliation

One more tale of St. Goar may be added, dealing this time with
Charlemagne's sons, Pepin and Karloman. These two, brave knights both,
had had a serious quarrel over the sovereignty of their father's vast
Empire. Gradually the breach widened to a deadly feud, and the brothers,
once the best of friends, became the bitterest enemies.

In 806 Charlemagne held an Imperial Diet at Thionville, and thither he
summoned his three sons, Karloman, Pepin, and Ludwig, intending to
divide the Empire, by testament, among them. Karloman was at that time
in Germany, and Pepin in Italy, where, with the aid of his sword, he had
won for himself broad lands. In order to reach Thionville both were
obliged to take the same path--that is, the Rhine, the broad waterway of
their father's dominions. Pepin was the first to come,

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

and as he sailed up the river with his train he caught sight of the
shrine of St. Goar, and bethought him that there he and his brother had
last met as friends. As he pondered on the strange fate that had made
enemies of them, once so full of kindness toward each other, he felt
curiously moved, and decided to put ashore and kneel by the shrine of
the saint.

Ere long Karloman and his train moved up the Rhine, and this prince
also, when he beheld the shrine of St. Goar, was touched with a feeling
of tenderness for his absent brother. Recollections of the time when
Pepin and he had been inseparable surged over him, and he too stepped
ashore and made his way through the wood to the sacred spot.

Meanwhile Pepin still knelt before the shrine, and great indeed was
Karloman's astonishment when he beheld his brother. But when he heard
Pepin pray aloud that they might be reconciled his joy and surprise knew
no bounds. All armed as he was, he strode up to his kneeling brother and
embraced him with tears, entreating his forgiveness for past
harshnesses. When Pepin raised the prince's visor and beheld the beloved
features of Karloman, his happiness was complete. Together the brothers
made for their ships; not, however, till they had left valuable gifts at
the shrine of the saint whose good offices had brought about their
reconciliation. Together they proceeded to the court of Charlemagne, who
partitioned his Empire between his three sons, making each a regent of
his portion during his father's lifetime.

From that time onward the brothers were fast friends. Karloman and
Pepin, however, had not long to live, for the former died in 810 and the
latter in the following year.

### Gutenfels, a Romance

A very charming story, and one entirely lacking in the element of gloom
and tragedy which is so marked a feature of most Rhenish tales, is that
which tradition assigns to the castle of Gutenfels. Its ancient name of
Caub, or Chaube, still clings to the town above which it towers
majestically.

In the thirteenth century Caub was the habitation of Sir Philip of
Falkenstein and his sister Guta, the latter justly acclaimed as the most
beautiful woman in Germany. She was reputed as proud as she was
beautiful, and of the many suitors who flocked to Caub to seek her hand
in marriage none could win from her a word of encouragement or even a
tender glance.

On one occasion she and her brother were present at a great tourney held
at Cologne, where the flower of knightly chivalry and maidenly beauty
were gathered in a brilliant assembly. Many an ardent glance was
directed to the fair maid of Caub, but she, accustomed to such homage,
was not moved thereby from her wonted composure.

At length a commotion passed through the assembly. A knight had entered
the lists whose name was not announced by the herald. It was whispered
that his identity was known only to the Archbishop, whose guest he was.
Of fine stature and handsome features, clad in splendid armour and
mounted on a richly caparisoned steed, he attracted not a little
attention, especially from the feminine portion of the assemblage. But
for none of the high-born ladies had he eyes, save for Guta, to whom his
glance was ever and anon directed, as though he looked to her to bring
him victory. The blushing looks of Guta showed that she was not
indifferent to the gallantry of the noble

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

stranger, and, truly, in her heart she wished him well. With clasped
hands she watched the combatants couch their lances and charge. Ah!
victory had fallen to the unknown knight. Soon it became evident that
the mysterious stranger was to carry off the prize of the tourney, for
there was none to match him in skill and prowess. As he rode past the
place where Guta sat he lowered his lance, and she, in her pleasure and
confusion at this mark of especial courtesy, dropped her glove, which
the knight instantly picked up, desiring to be allowed to keep it as a
guerdon.

At the grand ball which followed the tourney the victor remained all the
evening at Guta's side, and would dance with no other maiden. Young
Falkenstein, pleased with the homage paid to his sister by the
distinguished stranger, invited him to visit them at Caub, an invitation
which the gentle Guta seconded, and which the mysterious knight accepted
with alacrity.

True to his promise, ere a week had elapsed he arrived at Caub,
accompanied by two attendants. His visit covered three days, during
which time his host and hostess did all in their power to make his stay
a pleasant one. Ere he took his departure he sought out Guta and made
known his love. The lady acknowledged that his affection was returned.

"Dearest Guta," said the knight, "I may not yet reveal to thee my name,
but if thou wilt await my coming, in three months I shall return to
claim my bride, and thou shalt know all."

"I will be true to thee," exclaimed Guta passionately. "Though a king
should woo me, I will be true to thee."

And with that assurance from his betrothed the knight rode away.

Three months came and went, and still Guta heard

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

nothing of her absent lover. She grew paler and sadder as time advanced,
not because she doubted the honour of her knight, but because she feared
he had been slain in battle. It was indeed a time of wars and
dissensions. On the death of Conrad IV several claimants to the imperial
throne of Germany made their appearance, of whom the principal were
Adolph, Duke of Holland, Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother to the
English king Henry III, and Alfonso X, King of Castile. Of these three
the most popular was Richard of Cornwall, who was finally chosen by the
Electors, more on account of his knightly qualities than because of his
fabulous wealth. Among his most ardent followers was Philip of
Falkenstein, who was naturally much elated at his master's success. Now,
however, the conflict was over, and Philip had returned to Caub.

One morning, about six months after the departure of Guta's lover, a gay
cavalcade appeared at the gates of Caub, and a herald demanded admission
for Richard, Emperor of Germany. Philip himself, scarcely concealing his
joy and pride at the honour done him by his sovereign, ran out to greet
him, and the castle was full of stir and bustle. The Emperor praised
Philip heartily for his part in the recent wars, yet he seemed absent
and uneasy.

"Sir Philip," he said at length, "I have come hither to beg the hand of
thy fair sister; why is she not with us?"

Falkenstein was filled with amazement.

"Sire," he stammered, "I fear me thou wilt find my sister an unwilling
bride. She has refused many nobles of high estate, and I doubt whether
even a crown will tempt her. However, I will plead with her for thy
sake."

He left the room to seek Guta's bower, but soon returned with dejected
mien.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

"It is as I thought, sire," he said. "She will not be moved. Methinks
some heedless knight hath stolen her heart, for she hath grown pale and
drooping as a gathered blossom."

Richard raised his visor.

"Knowest thou me, sir knight?" he said.

"Thou art--the knight of the tourney," cried Philip in amaze.

"The same," answered Richard, smiling. "And I am the knight who has won
thy fair sister's heart. We plighted our troth after the tourney of
Cologne. State affairs of the gravest import have kept me from her side,
where I would fain have been these six months past. Take this
token"--drawing from his breast the glove Guta had given him--"and tell
her that a poor knight in Richard's train sends her this."

In a little while Philip returned with his sister. The maiden looked
pale and agitated, but when she beheld Richard she rushed to him and was
clasped in his arms.

"My own Guta," he whispered fondly. "And wouldst thou refuse an emperor
to marry me?"

"Yea, truly," answered the maid, "a hundred emperors. I feared thou
hadst forsaken me altogether," she added naively.

Richard laughed.

"Would I be a worthy Emperor an I did not keep my troth with such as
thou?" he asked.

"The Emperor--thou?" cried Guta, starting back.

"Yea, the Emperor, and none other," said her brother reverently. And
once more Guta hid her face on Richard's breast.

Within a week they were married, and Guta accompanied her husband to the
court as Empress of Germany.

To the castle where his bride had passed her maidenhood Richard gave the
name of Gutenfels--'Rock of Guta'--which name it has retained to this
day.

### The Story of Schönburg

The castle of Schönburg, not far from the town of Bacharach, is now in
ruins, but was once a place of extraordinary fame, for here dwelt at one
time seven sisters of transcendent beauty, who were courted the more
assiduously because their father, the Graf von Schönburg, was reputed a
man of great wealth. This wealth was no myth, but an actuality, and in
truth it had been mainly acquired in predatory forays; but the nobles of
Rhineland recked little of this, and scores of them flitted around and
pressed their suit on the young ladies. None of these, however, felt
inclined toward marriage just yet, each vowing its yoke too galling; and
so the gallants came in vain to the castle, their respective addresses
being invariably dallied with and then dismissed. Suitor after suitor
retired in despair, pondering on the strange ways of womankind; but one
evening a large party of noblemen chanced to be assembled at the
schloss, and putting their heads together, they decided to press matters
to a conclusion. They agreed that all of them, in gorgeous raiment,
should gather in the banqueting-hall of the castle; the seven sisters
should be summoned and called upon in peremptory fashion to have done
with silken dalliance and to end matters by selecting seven husbands
from among them. The young ladies received the summons with some
amusement, all of them being blessed with the saving grace of humour,
and they bade the knight who had brought the message return to his
fellows and tell them that the suggested interview would be held. "Only
give us time,"

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

said the sisters, "for the donning of our most becoming dresses."

So now the band of suitors mustered, and a brave display they made, each
of them thinking himself more handsome and gorgeous than his neighbours
and boasting that he would be among the chosen seven. But as time sped
on and the ladies still tarried, the young men began to grow anxious;
many of them spoke aloud of female vanity, and made derisive comments on
the coiffing and the like, which they imagined was the cause of the
delay; eventually one of their number, tired of strutting before a
mirror, happened to go to look out of the window toward the Rhine.
Suddenly he uttered a loud imprecation, and his companions, thronging to
the window, were all fiercely incensed at the sight which greeted their
eyes. For the famous seven sisters were perpetrating something of a
practical joke; they were leaving the castle in a boat, and on
perceiving the men's faces at the windows they gave vent to a loud laugh
of disdain. Hardly had the angry suitors realized that they were the
butt of the ladies' ridicule when they were seized with consternation.
For one of the sisters, in the attempt to shake her fist at the men she
affected to despise, tried to stand up on one of the thwarts of the
boat, which, being a light craft, was upset at once. The girls' taunts
were now changed to loud cries for help, none being able to swim; but
ere another boat could be launched the Rhine had claimed its prey, and
the perfidious damsels were drowned in the swift tide.

But their memory was not destined to be erased from the traditions of
the locality. Near the place where the tragedy occurred there are seven
rocks, visible only on rare occasions when the river is very low, and
till lately

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

it was a popular superstition that these rocks were placed there by
Providence, anxious to impart a moral to young women addicted to
coquetry and practical jests. To this day many boatmen on the Rhine
regard these rocks with awe, and it is told that now and then seven
wraiths are to be seen there; it is even asserted that sometimes these
apparitions sing in strains as delectable as those of the Lorelei
herself.

### The Legend of Pfalz

Musing on the legendary lore of the Rhine, we cannot but be struck by
the sadness pervading these stories, and we are inclined to believe that
every one of them culminates in tragedy. But there are a few exceptions
to this rule, and among them is a tale associated with the island of
Pfalz, near Bacharach, which concludes in fairly happy fashion, if in
the main concerned with suffering.

This island of Pfalz still contains the ruins of a castle, known as
Pfalzgrafenstein. It belonged in medieval days to the Palatine Princes,
and at the time our story opens one of these, named Hermann, having
suspected his wife, the Princess Guba, of infidelity, had lately caused
her to be incarcerated within it. Its governor, Count von Roth, was
charged to watch the prisoner's movements carefully; but, being sure she
was innocent, his measures with her were generally lenient, while his
countess soon formed a deep friendship for the Princess. Thus it seemed
to Guba that her captivity was not destined to be so terrible as she had
anticipated, but she was soon disillusioned, as will appear presently.
It should be explained that as yet the Princess had borne no children to
her husband, whose heir-apparent was consequently his brother Ludwig;
and this person naturally tried to prevent a reconciliation

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

between the Palatine Prince and his wife, for should they be united
again, Ludwig's hope to succeed his brother might be frustrated. So he
was a frequent visitor to the Pfalzgrafenstein, constantly telling von
Roth that he allowed the Princess too much liberty. Worse still, Ludwig
sometimes remained at the island castle for a long time, and at these
periods the prisoner underwent constant ill-treatment, which the
Governor was powerless to alleviate.

The people of the neighbourhood felt kindly toward Guba, but their
sympathy was of little avail; and at length during one of Ludwig's
visits to Pfalzgrafenstein it seemed as though he was about to triumph
and effect a final separation between the Princess and Hermann. For it
transpired one evening that Guba was not within the castle. A hue and
cry was instantly raised, and the island was searched by Ludwig and von
Roth. "I wager," said Ludwig, "that at this very moment Guba is with her
paramour. Let my brother the Prince hear of this, and your life will
answer for it. Often have I urged you to be stricter; you see now the
result of your leniency."

Von Roth protested that the Princess was taking the air alone; but while
they argued the pair espied Guba, and it was as Ludwig had said--she was
attended by a man.

"The bird is snared," shouted Ludwig; and as he and von Roth ran toward
the offending couple they separated instantly, the man making for a boat
moored hard by. But ere he could reach it he was caught by his pursuers,
and recognized for a certain young gallant of the district. He was
dragged to the castle, where after a brief trial he was condemned to be
hanged. He blanched on hearing the sentence, but faced his fate
manfully, and when the rope was about his neck he declared loudly that
Guba

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

had always discouraged his addresses and was innocent of the sin
wherewith she was charged.

Guba's movements thenceforth were watched more strictly for a while, yet
she seemed to grow more cheerful, while one day she even asserted that
she would soon be reconciled to her husband, from whom she had now been
estranged for six months. In short, she announced that she was soon to
be a mother; while she was confident that the child would resemble the
Palatine Prince, and that the latter's delight on finding himself a
father would result in the ending of all her troubles. The Governor and
his lady were both doubtful as to the parentage of the child,
remembering the recent circumstances which had seemed to cast some
shadow upon the Princess herself; yet they held their peace, awaiting
until in due course the Princess was delivered of a boy. But, alack! the
child bore no resemblance to Hermann; and so von Roth and his wife,
meaning to be kind, enjoined silence and sent the child away--all of
which was the more easily accomplished as the spiteful Ludwig chanced to
be far distant at the time.

At first the mother was broken-hearted, but the Governor and his wife
comforted her by saying that the child was no farther off than a castle
on the opposite banks of the Rhine. Here, they assured her, he would be
well nurtured; moreover, they had arranged that, so long as her son was
alive and thriving, the fact was to be signified to her by the display
of a small white flag on the battlements of his lodging. And so, day
after day, the anxious mother paced her island prison, looking
constantly toward the signal which meant so much to her.

Many years went by in this fashion, and in course of time Hermann was
gathered to his fathers, and Ludwig ascended the Palatine throne. But
scarcely was his rule begun ere it

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

was noised abroad that he was a usurper, for a young man appeared who
claimed to be the son of Hermann, and therefore the rightful heir. Now,
most of the people detested Ludwig, and when they marked the claimant's
resemblance to the deceased Prince a number of them banded themselves
together to set him upon the throne.

A fierce civil war ensued, many of the nobles forsaking Ludwig for his
rival, who, like the late Prince, bore the name of Hermann; and though
at first it seemed doubtful which party was to triumph, eventually
Ludwig was worsted, and was hanged for his perfidy. The tidings spread
throughout the Rhineland, and one day a body of men-at-arms came to
Pfalzgrafenstein and informed von Roth that his prisoner was to be freed
at once and was to repair to the Palatine court, there to take up her
rightful position as Queen-Dowager. Guba was amazed on hearing this
news, for she had long since ceased to hope that her present mode of
life would be altered, and asking to be presented to the chief messenger
that she might question him, she suddenly experienced a yet greater
surprise. . . . Yes! her son had come in person to liberate her; and von
Roth and his wife, as they witnessed the glad union, were convinced at
last of Guba's innocence, for the young man who clasped her to his bosom
had changed wondrously since his childhood, and was now indeed the
living image of his father. For some minutes the mother wept with joy,
but when her son bade her make ready for instant departure she replied
that she had lost all desire for the stately life of a court.
Pfalzgrafenstein, she declared, had become truly a part of her life, so
here she would end her days. She had not long to live, she added, and
what greater pleasure could she have than the knowledge that her son was
alive and well, and was ruling his people wisely?

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

And so Guba remained at the island, a prison no longer; and daily she
paced by the swirling stream, often gazing toward the castle where her
son had been nurtured, and meditating on the time when she was wont to
look there for the white flag which meant so much to her anxious heart.

### A Legend of Fürstenberg

High above the Rhine tower the ruins of Fürstenberg, and more than one
legend clings to the ancient pile, linking it with stirring medieval
times.

Perhaps the most popular of these traditions is that which tells of the
Phantom Mother of Fürstenberg, a tale full of pathos and tragedy.

In the thirteenth century there dwelt in the castle a nobleman, Franz
von Fürst by name, who, after a wild and licentious youth, settled down
to a more sober and serious manhood. His friends, surprised at the
change which had taken place in him, and anxious that this new mode of
life should be maintained, urged him to take a virtuous maiden to wife.
Such a bride as they desired for him was found in Kunigunda von
Flörsheim, a maiden who was as beautiful as she was high-born.

For a time after their marriage all went well, and Franz and his young
wife seemed quite happy. Moreover, in time a son was born to them, of
whom his father seemed to be very proud. The Baron's reformation, said
his friends, was complete.

One evening there came to Kunigunda a young lady friend. The girl, whose
name was Amina, was the daughter of a robber-baron who dwelt in a
neighbouring castle. But his predatory acts had at last forced him to
flee for his life, and no one knew whither he had gone. His household

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

was broken up, and Amina, finding herself without a home, had now
repaired to Fürstenberg to seek refuge. Kunigunda, ever willing to aid
those in distress, extended a hearty welcome to the damsel, and Amina
was henceforth an inmate of the schloss.

Now, though Amina was fully as lovely in face and form as her young
hostess, she yet lacked the moral beauty of Kunigunda. Of a subtle and
crafty disposition, she showed the gratitude of the serpent by stinging
the hand extended to help her; in a word, she set herself to win the
unlawful affections of the Lord of Fürstenberg. He, weak creature as he
was, allowed the latent baseness of his nature to be stirred by her
youth and beauty. He listened when she whispered that Kunigunda had
grown cold toward him; at her suggestion he interpreted his wife's
modest demeanour as indifference, and already he began to feel the yoke
of matrimony heavy upon him.

Poor Kunigunda was in despair when she realized that her husband had
transferred his affections; but what was worse, she learned that the
pair were plotting against her life. At length their cruel scheming
succeeded, and one morning Kunigunda was found dead in her bed. Franz
made it known that she had been stifled by a fit of coughing, and her
remains were hastily conveyed to the family vault. Within a week the
false Amina was the bride of the Baron von Fürstenberg.

Little Hugo, the son of Kunigunda, was to suffer much at the hands of
his stepmother and her dependents. The new mistress of the Schloss
Fürstenberg hated the child as she had hated his mother, and Hugo was
given into the charge of an ill-natured old nurse, who frequently beat
him in the night because he awakened her with his cries.

One night the old hag was roused from her sleep by a

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

strange sound, the sound of a cradle being rocked. She imagined herself
dreaming. Who would come to this distant tower to rock the little Hugo?
Not Amina, of that she was sure! Again the sound was heard, unmistakably
the creaking of the cradle. Drawing aside her bed-curtains, the crone
beheld a strange sight. Over the cradle a woman was bending, clad in
long, white garments, and singing a low lullaby, and as she raised her
pale face, behold! it was that of the dead Kunigunda. The nurse could
neither shriek nor faint; as though fascinated, she watched the wraith
nursing her child, until at cockcrow Kunigunda vanished.

In trembling tones the nurse related what she had seen to Franz and
Amina. The Baron was scornful, and ridiculed the whole affair as a
dream. But the cunning Amina, though she did not believe that a ghost
had visited the child, thought that perhaps her rival was not really
dead, and her old hatred and jealousy were reawakened. So she told her
husband that she intended to see for herself whether there was any truth
in the fantastic story, and would sleep that night in the nurse's bed.
She did not mention her suspicions, nor the fact that she carried a
sharp dagger. She was roused in the night, as the old woman had been, by
the sound of a cradle being rocked. Stealthily drawing the curtains, she
saw the white-robed form of the dead, the black mould clinging to her
hair, the hue of death in her face. With a wild cry Amina flung herself
upon Kunigunda, only to find that she was stabbing at a thing of air, an
impalpable apparition which vanished at a touch. Overcome with rage and
fear, she sank to the ground. The wraith moved to the door, turning with
a warning gesture ere she vanished from sight, and Amina lost
consciousness.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

In the morning the Baron sought his wife in vain. He found instead a
missive telling of her ghastly experience, intimating her intention of
retiring to a nunnery, and closing with an earnest appeal to her husband
to repent of his crimes.

The Baron, moved with remorse and terror, followed Amina's example; he
sought in the mountain solitudes a hermitage where he might end his days
in peace, and having found such a cell, he confided his little son to
the care of the pastor of Wedenschied, and retired from the world in
which he had played so sorry a part.

### The Blind Archer

Another legend connected with the ruined stronghold of Fürstenberg is
the following. Long ago, in the days when bitter feuds and rivalries
existed between the owners of neighbouring fortresses, there dwelt in
Fürstenberg a good old knight, Sir Oswald by name, well versed in the
arts of war, and particularly proficient in archery. He had one son,
Edwin, a handsome young man who bade fair to equal his father in skill
and renown.

Sir Oswald had a sworn foe in a neighbouring baron, Wilm von Sooneck, a
rich, unscrupulous nobleman who sought by every possible means to get
the knight into his power. At length his cunning schemes met with
success; an ambush was laid for the unsuspecting Oswald as he rode past
Sooneck Castle, attended only by a groom, and both he and his servant
were flung into a tower, there to await the pleasure of their captor.

And what that nobleman's pleasure was soon became evident. Ere many days
had elapsed Oswald was informed that his eyes were to be put out, and
soon the cruel decree was carried into execution.

 

<span id="img_19200"></span>

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

Meanwhile Edwin awaited the coming of his father; and when he came not
it was at first concluded that he had been captured or slain by robbers.
But there were no evidences forthcoming to show that Sir Oswald had met
with such a fate, and his son began to suspect that his father had
fallen into the hands of Baron Wilm, for he knew of the bitter hatred
which he bore toward the knight of Fürstenberg and of his cunning and
malice. He therefore cast about for a means of verifying his suspicions,
and eventually disguised himself as a wandering minstrel, took his
harp--for he had great skill as a musician--and set off in the direction
of Sooneck. There he seated himself under a tree and played and sang
sweetly, directing his gaze the while toward a strong tower which seemed
to him a likely place for the incarceration of prisoners. The plaintive
charm of the melody attracted the attention of a passing peasant, who
drew near to listen; when the last note of the song had died away, he
seated himself beside the minstrel and entered into conversation with
him.

"Methinks thou hast an interest in yonder tower," he said.

"In truth it interests me," responded Edwin, nevertheless veiling his
concern as much as possible by a seeming indifference. "Is it a prison,
think you?"

"Ay, that it is," replied the peasant with a laugh. "’Tis the cage where
my lord of Sooneck keeps the birds whose feathers he has plucked."

Edwin, still with a show of indifference, questioned him further, and
elicited the fact that the peasant had witnessed the capture and
incarceration in the tower of a knight and his servant on the very day
when Sir Oswald and his groom had disappeared. Nothing more could

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Edwin glean, save
that a few days hence Baron Wilm was to give a grand banquet, when many
nobles and knights were to be present.

The young man, his suspicions thus fully confirmed, felt that his next
move must be to gain entrance to the castle, and he decided to take
advantage of the excitement and bustle attendant on the banquet to
achieve this end. Accordingly, on the day fixed for the feast he again
donned his minstrel's garb, and repaired to the Schloss Sooneck. Here,
as he had anticipated, all was excitement and gaiety. Wine flowed
freely, tongues were loosened, and the minstrel was welcomed
uproariously and bidden to sing his best songs in return for a beaker of
Rhenish. Soon the greater part of the company were tipsy, and Edwin
moved among them, noting their conversation, coming at length to the
seat of the host.

"It is said," remarked a knight, "that you have captured Sir Oswald of
Fürstenberg."

Wilm, to whom the remark was addressed, smiled knowingly and did not
deny the charge.

"I have even heard," pursued his companion, "that you have had his eyes
put out."

The Baron laughed outright, as at an excellent jest.

"Then you have heard truly," he said.

At this point another knight broke into the conversation. "It is a
pity," said he. "There are but few archers to match Oswald of
Fürstenberg."

"I wager he can still hit a mark if it be set up," said he who had first
spoken.

"Done!" cried Sooneck, and when the terms of the wager had been fixed
the Baron directed that Oswald should be brought from the tower.

Edwin had overheard the conversation with a breaking

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

heart, and grief and shame almost overwhelmed him when he saw his
father, pitifully quiet and dignified, led into the banquet-hall to
provide sport for a company of drunken revellers. Oswald was informed of
the wager, and bow and arrows were placed in his hands.

"Baron von Sooneck," he cried, "where is the mark?"

"This cup I place upon the table," came the reply.

The arrow was fitted to the bow, released, and lo! it was not the cup
which was hit, but the Lord of Sooneck, who fell forward heavily, struck
to the heart and mortally wounded.

In a moment a loud outcry was raised, but ere action could be taken the
minstrel had sprung in front of Oswald, and boldly faced the assembly.

"This knight," he cried, "shamefully maltreated by yonder villain, is my
father. Whoso thinks he has acted wrongly in forfeiting the life of his
torturer shall answer to me. With my sword I shall teach him better
judgment."

The astonished knights, completely sobered by the tragic occurrence,
could not but admire the courage of the lad who thus boldly championed
his father, and with one voice they declared that Sir Oswald was a true
knight and had done justly.

So the blind knight, once more free, returned to his castle of
Fürstenberg, compensated in part for the loss of his sight by the loving
devotion of his son.

### Rheinstein and Reichenstein

Centuries ago the castles of Rheinstein and Reichenstein frowned at each
other from neighbouring eminences. But far from being hostile, they were
the residences of two lovers. Kuno of Reichenstein loved the fair Gerda
of Rheinstein with a consuming passion, and, as is so

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

common with lovers in all ages, doubted whether his love were returned.
In his devotion for the maiden he showered on her many gifts, and
although his purse was light and he was master of only a single tower,
he did not spare his gold if only he could make her happy and gain from
her one look of approval.

On one occasion he presented to her a beauteous horse of the Limousin
strain, bred under the shadow of his own castle. Deep-chested, with
arched neck and eye of fire, the noble steed aroused the liveliest
interest in the breast of Gerda, and she was eloquent in her thanks to
the giver until, observing his ardent glances, her cheeks suffused with
blushes. Taking her soft hand between his sunburnt palms, Kuno poured
into her ear the story of his love.

"Gerda," he whispered, "I am a poor man. I have nothing but my sword, my
ruined tower yonder, and honour. But they are yours. Will you take them
with my heart?"

She lifted her blue eyes to his, full of truth and trust. "I will be
yours," she murmured; "yours and none other's till death."

Young Kuno left Rheinstein that afternoon, his heart beating high with
hope and happiness. The blood coursing through his veins at a gallop
made him spur his charger to a like pace. But though he rode fast his
brain was as busy as his hand and his heart. He must, in conformity with
Rhenish custom, send as an embassy to Gerda's father one of his most
distinguished relations. To whom was he to turn? There was no one but
old Kurt, his wealthy uncle, whom he could send as an emissary, and
although the old man had an unsavoury reputation, he decided to confide
the mission to him. Kurt undertook the task in no kindly spirit, for he

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

disliked Kuno because of his virtuous life and the circumstance that he
was his heir, whom he felt was waiting to step into his shoes. However,
he waited next day upon Gerda's father, the Lord of Rheinstein, and was
received with all the dignity suitable to his rank and age. But when his
glance rested upon the fair and innocent Gerda, such a fierce desire to
make her his arose in his withered breast that when she had withdrawn he
demanded her hand for himself. To her father he drew an alluring picture
of his rank, his possessions, his castles, his gold, until the old man,
with whom avarice was a passion, gave a hearty consent to his suit, and
dismissed him with the assurance that Gerda would be his within the
week.

The clatter of hoofs had hardly died away when the Lord of Rheinstein
sought his daughter's bower, where she sat dreaming of Kuno. In honeyed
words the old man described the enviable position she would occupy as
the spouse of a wealthy man, and then conveyed to her the information
that Kurt had asked him for her hand. Gerda, insulted at the mere
thought of becoming the bride of such a man, refused to listen to the
proposal, even from the lips of her father, and she acquainted him with
her love for Kuno, whom, she declared, she had fully resolved to marry.
At this avowal her father worked himself into a furious passion, and
assured her that she should never be the bride of such a penniless
adventurer. After further insulting the absent Kuno, and alluding in a
most offensive manner to his daughter's lack of discernment and good
taste, he quitted her bower, assuring her as he went that she should
become the bride of Kurt on the morrow.

Gerda spent a miserable night sitting by the dying fire in her chamber,
planning how she might escape from the detested Kurt, until at last her
wearied brain refused to

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

work and she fell into a troubled slumber. In the morning she was
awakened by her handmaiden, who, greatly concerned for her mistress, had
spent the night in prayer. But Gerda's tears had fled with the morning,
and she resolved, come what might, to refuse to the last to wed with the
hateful Kurt. She learned that Kuno had attempted to assault the castle
during the night with the object of carrying her off, but that he had
been repulsed with some loss to his small force. This made her only the
more determined to persist in her resistance to his uncle.

Meantime the vassals and retainers of the house of Rheinstein had been
summoned to the castle to attend the approaching ceremony, and their gay
apparel now shone and glittered in the sunshine. The sound of pipe,
tabour, and psaltery in melodious combination arose from the valley, and
all hearts, save one, were happy. The gates were thrown open, and the
bridal procession formed up to proceed to the ancient church where the
unhappy Gerda was to be sacrificed to Kurt. First came a crowd of serfs,
men, women, and children, all shouting in joyful anticipation of the
wedding feast. Then followed the vassals and retainers of the Lord of
Rheinstein, according to their several degrees, and, last, the principal
actors in the shameful ceremony, Kurt, surrounded by his retainers, and
the Lord of Rheinstein with the luckless Gerda. The mellow tones of the
bell of St. Clement mingled sweetly with the sound of the flute and the
pipe and the merry voices of the wedding throng. Gerda, mounted upon her
spirited Limousin steed, the gift of Kuno, shuddered as she felt Kurt's
eyes resting upon her, and she cast a despairing glance at the tower of
Kuno's castle, where, disconsolate and heavy of heart, he watched the
bridal procession from the highest turret.

 

<span id="img_19800"></span>

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

The procession halted at the portal of the church, and all dismounted
save Gerda. She was approached by the bridegroom, who with an air of
leering gallantry offered her his assistance in alighting. At this
moment swarms of gadflies rested on the flanks of the Limousin steed,
and the spirited beast, stung to madness by the flies, reared, plunged,
and broke away in a gallop, scattering the spectators to right and left,
and flying like the wind along the river-bank.

"To horse, to horse!" cried Kurt and the Lord of Rheinstein, and
speedily as many mounted, the bridegroom, for all his age, was first in
the saddle.

With the clattering of a hundred hoofs the wedding party galloped madly
along Rhineside, Kurt leading on a fleet and powerful charger.

"Halt!" he cried. "Draw rein--draw rein!" But notwithstanding their
shouts, cries, and entreaties, Gerda spurred on the already maddened
Limousin, which thundered along the familiar road to Kuno's castle of
Reichenstein. The noble steed's direction was quickly espied by Kuno,
who hastened to the principal entrance of his stronghold.

"Throw open the gates," he shouted. "Down with the drawbridge. Bravo,
gallant steed!"

But Kurt was close behind. Gerda could feel the breath of his charger on
the hands which held her rein. Close he rode by her, but might never
snatch her from the saddle. Like the wind they sped. Now she was a pace
in front, now they careered onward neck and neck.

Suddenly he leaned over to seize her rein, but at that instant his horse
stumbled, fell, and threw the ancient gallant heavily. Down he came on a
great boulder and lay motionless.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

Another moment, and the hoof-beat of the breathless steed sounded on the
drawbridge of Reichenstein. The vassals of Kuno hastened to the gate to
resist the expected attack, but there was none. For the wretched Kurt
lay dead, killed by the fall, and his vassals were now eager to acclaim
Kuno as their lord, while the Lord of Rheinstein, shrewdly observing the
direction of affairs, took advantage of the tumultuous moment to make
his peace with Kuno. The lovers were wedded next day amid the
acclamations of their friends and retainers, and Kuno and Gerda dwelt in
Rheinstein for many a year, loving and beloved.
