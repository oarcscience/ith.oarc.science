    CHAPTER XXIII

    Of the sorrow that Percivale and Bors made when Galahad
    was dead: and of Percivale how he died, and other
    matters.


    WHEN Percivale and Bors saw Galahad dead they made
    as much sorrow as ever did two men.  And if they had
    not been good men they might lightly have fallen in
    despair.  And the people of the country and of the city
    were right heavy.  And then he was buried; and as soon
    as he was buried Sir Percivale yielded him to an hermitage
    out of the city, and took a religious clothing.  And Bors
    was alway with him, but never changed he his secular
    clothing, for that he purposed him to go again into the
    realm of Logris.  Thus a year and two months lived Sir
    Percivale in the hermitage a full holy life, and then passed
    out of this world; and Bors let bury him by his sister and
    by Galahad in the spiritualities.

    When Bors saw that he was in so far countries as in the
    parts of Babylon he departed from Sarras, and armed him
    and came to the sea, and entered into a ship; and so it
    befell him in good adventure he came into the realm of
    Logris; and he rode so fast till he came to Camelot where
    the king was.  And then was there great joy made of him
    in the court, for they weened all he had been dead,
    forasmuch as he had been so long out of the country.  And
    when they had eaten, the king made great clerks to come
    afore him, that they should chronicle of the high adventures
    of the good knights.  When Bors had told him of
    the adventures of the Sangreal, such as had befallen him
    and his three fellows, that was Launcelot, Percivale,
    Galahad, and himself, there Launcelot told the adventures of
    the Sangreal that he had seen.  All this was made in great
    books, and put up in almeries at Salisbury.  And anon Sir
    Bors said to Sir Launcelot: Galahad, your own son,
    saluted you by me, and after you King Arthur and all the
    court, and so did Sir Percivale, for I buried them with
    mine own hands in the city of Sarras.  Also, Sir Launcelot,
    Galahad prayed you to remember of this unsiker world as
    ye behight him when ye were together more than half a
    year.  This is true, said Launcelot; now I trust to God
    his prayer shall avail me.

    Then Launcelot took Sir Bors in his arms, and said:
    Gentle cousin, ye are right welcome to me, and all that
    ever I may do for you and for yours ye shall find my poor
    body ready at all times, while the spirit is in it, and that I
    promise you faithfully, and never to fail.  And wit ye well,
    gentle cousin, Sir Bors, that ye and I will never depart
    asunder whilst our lives may last.  Sir, said he, I will as
    ye will.
