    CHAPTER VI

    How a damosel, which was love to Lanceor, slew herself
    for love, and how Balin met with his brother Balan.

    THEN he looked by him, and was ware of a damosel that came riding
    full fast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey.  And when
    she espied that Lanceor was slain, she made sorrow out of
    measure, and said, O Balin, two bodies thou hast slain and one
    heart, and two hearts in one body, and two souls thou hast lost. 
    And therewith she took the sword from her love that lay dead, and
    fell to the ground in a swoon.  And when she arose she made great
    dole out of measure, the which sorrow grieved Balin passingly
    sore, and he went unto her for to have taken the sword out of her
    hand, but she held it so fast he might not take it out of her
    hand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she set the
    pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body.  When
    Balin espied her deeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and
    ashamed that so fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love
    of his death.  Alas, said Balin, me repenteth sore the death of
    this knight, for the love of this damosel, for there was much
    true love betwixt them both, and for sorrow might not longer
    behold him, but turned his horse and looked toward a great
    forest, and there he was ware, by the arms, of his brother Balan. 
    And when they were met they put off their helms and kissed
    together, and wept for joy and pity.  Then Balan said, I little
    weened to have met with you at this sudden adventure; I am right
    glad of your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment, for a
    man told me, in the castle of Four Stones, that ye were
    delivered, and that man had seen you in the court of King Arthur,
    and therefore I came hither into this country, for here I
    supposed to find you.  Anon the knight Balin told his brother of
    his adventure of the sword, and of the death of the Lady of the
    Lake, and how King Arthur was <58>displeased with him.  Wherefore
    he sent this knight after me, that lieth here dead, and the death
    of this damosel grieveth me sore.  So doth it me, said Balan, but
    ye must take the adventure that God will ordain you.  Truly, said
    Balin, I am right heavy that my Lord Arthur is displeased with
    me, for he is the most worshipful knight that reigneth now on
    earth, and his love will I get or else will I put my life in
    adventure.  For the King Rience lieth at a siege at the Castle
    Terrabil, and thither will we draw in all haste, to prove our
    worship and prowess upon him.  I will well, said Balan, that we
    do, and we will help each other as brethren ought to do.
