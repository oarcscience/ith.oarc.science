    CHAPTER XXI

    How Sir Tristram rescued a child from a knight, and
    how Gouvernail told him of King Anguish.

    THE knight turned his horse and made him ready to fight.  And
    then Sir Tristram smote him with a sword such a buffet that he
    tumbled to the earth.  And then he yielded him unto Sir Tristram. 
    Then come thy way, said Sir Tristram, and bring the child to the
    lady again.  So he took his horse meekly and rode with Sir
    Tristram; and then by the way Sir Tristram asked him his name. 
    Then he said, My name is Breuse Saunce Pite.  So when he had
    delivered that child to the lady, he said:  Sir, as in this the
    child is well remedied.  Then Sir Tristram let <313>him go again
    that sore repented him after, for he was a great foe unto many
    good knights of King Arthur's court.

    Then when Sir Tristram was in his pavilion Gouvernail, his man,
    came and told him how that King Anguish of Ireland was come
    thither, and he was put in great distress; and there Gouvernail
    told Sir Tristram how King Anguish was summoned and appealed of
    murder.  So God me help, said Sir Tristram, these be the best
    tidings that ever came to me this seven years, for now shall the
    King of Ireland have need of my help; for I daresay there is no
    knight in this country that is not of Arthur's court dare do
    battle with Sir Blamore de Ganis; and for to win the love of the
    King of Ireland I will take the battle upon me; and therefore
    Gouvernail bring me, I charge thee, to the king.

    Then Gouvernail went unto King Anguish of Ireland, and saluted
    him fair.  The king welcomed him and asked him what he would. 
    Sir, said Gouvernail, here is a knight near hand that desireth to
    speak with you: he bade me say he would do you service.  What
    knight is he? said the king.  Sir, said he, it is Sir Tristram de
    Liones, that for your good grace that ye showed him in your lands
    will reward you in this country.  Come on, fellow, said the king,
    with me anon and show me unto Sir Tristram.  So the king took a
    little hackney and but few fellowship with him, until he came
    unto Sir Tristram's pavilion.  And when Sir Tristram saw the king
    he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup.  But the king
    leapt from his horse lightly, and either halsed other in their
    arms.  My gracious lord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your
    great goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at
    that time I promised you to do you service an ever it lay in my
    power.  And, gentle knight, said the king unto Sir Tristram, now
    have I great need of you, never had I so great need of no
    knight's help.  How so, my good lord? said Sir Tristram.  I shall
    tell you, said the king:  I am summoned and appealed from my
    country for the <3I4>death of a knight that was kin unto the good
    knight Sir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother to
    Sir Bleoberis hath appealed me to fight with him, outher to find
    a knight in my stead.  And well I wot, said the king, these that
    are come of King Ban's blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other,
    are passing good knights, and hard men for to win in battle as
    any that I know now living.  Sir, said Sir Tristram, for the good
    lordship ye showed me in Ireland, and for my lady your daughter's
    sake, La Beale Isoud, I will take the battle for you upon this
    condition that ye shall grant me two things: that one is that ye
    shall swear to me that ye are in the right, that ye were never
    consenting to the knight's death; Sir, then said Sir Tristram,
    when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace that I
    speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that
    I will ask of you.  So God me help, said the king, ye shall have
    whatsomever ye will ask.  It is well said, said Sir Tristram.
