    CHAPTER XI

    How Joseph made a cross on the white shield with his
    blood, and how Galahad was by a monk brought to
    a tomb.


    NOT long after that Joseph was laid in his deadly bed.
    And when King Evelake saw that he made much sorrow,
    and said:  For thy love I have left my country, and sith
    ye shall depart out of this world, leave me some token of
    yours that I may think on you.  Joseph said:  That will
    I do full gladly; now bring me your shield that I took
    you when ye went into battle against King Tolleme.
    Then Joseph bled sore at the nose, so that he might not
    by no mean be staunched.  And there upon that shield
    he made a cross of his own blood.  Now may ye see a
    remembrance that I love you, for ye shall never see this
    shield but ye shall think on me, and it shall be always as
    fresh as it is now.  And never shall man bear this shield
    about his neck but he shall repent it, unto the time that
    Galahad, the good knight, bear it; and the last of my
    lineage shall have it about his neck, that shall do many
    marvellous deeds.  Now, said King Evelake, where shall
    I put this shield, that this worthy knight may have it?
    Ye shall leave it thereas Nacien, the hermit, shall be put
    after his death; for thither shall that good knight come
    the fifteenth day after that he shall receive the order of
    knighthood: and so that day that they set is this time
    that he have his shield, and in the same abbey lieth
    Nacien, the hermit.  And then the White Knight
    vanished away.

    Anon as the squire had heard these words, he alighted
    off his hackney and kneeled down at Galahad's feet, and
    prayed him that he might go with him till he had made him
    knight.  Yea,[1] I would not refuse you.  Then will ye
    make me a knight? said the squire, and that order, by the
    grace of God, shall be well set in me.  So Sir Galahad
    granted him, and turned again unto the abbey where they
    came from; and there men made great joy of Sir Galahad.
    And anon as he was alighted there was a monk brought
    him unto a tomb in a churchyard, where there was such a
    noise that who that heard it should verily nigh be mad or
    lose his strength: and sir, they said, we deem it is a fiend.

    will save the sense.
