    CHAPTER VIlI

    How each of them knew other, and of their great courtesy,
    and how his brother Sir Ector came unto him, and of
    their joy.


    AND therewithal Sir Launcelot kneeled down upon his
    knees, and threw away his shield and his sword from
    him.  When Sir Percivale saw him do so he marvelled
    what he meant.  And then thus he said:  Sir knight,
    whatsomever thou be, I require thee upon the high
    order of knighthood, tell me thy true name.  Then he
    said:  So God me help, my name is Sir Launcelot du
    Lake, King Ban's son of Benoy.  Alas, said Sir Percivale,
    what have I done?  I was sent by the queen for to
    seek you, and so I have sought you nigh this two
    year, and yonder is Sir Ector de Maris, your brother
    abideth me on the other side of the yonder water.  Now
    for God's sake, said Sir Percivale, forgive me mine offences
    that I have here done.  It is soon forgiven, said Sir
    Launcelot.

    Then Sir Percivale sent for Sir Ector de Maris, 
    and when Sir Launcelot had a sight of him, he ran
    unto him and took him in his arms; and then Sir
    Ector kneeled down, and either wept upon other, that
    all had pity to behold them.  Then came Dame Elaine
    and she there made them great cheer as might lie in
    her power; and there she told Sir Ector and Sir
    Percivale how and in what manner Sir Launcelot came
    into that country, and how he was healed; and there
    it was known how long Sir Launcelot was with Sir
    Bliant and with Sir Selivant, and how he first met with
    them, and how he departed from them because of a
    boar; and how the hermit healed Sir Launcelot of his
    great wound, and how that he came to Corbin.
