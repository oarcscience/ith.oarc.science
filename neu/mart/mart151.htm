CHAPTER XXXIII

How Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine fought each against other,
and how they knew each other by the damosel Linet.

SO the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there
he saw an armed knight coming toward him.  Then Sir Gareth took
the duke's shield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without
biding they ran together as it had been the thunder.  And there
that knight hurt Sir Gareth under the side with his spear.  And
then they alighted and drew their swords, and gave great strokes
that the blood trailed to the ground.  And so they fought two
hours.

At the last there came the damosel Linet, that some men called
the damosel Savage, and she came riding upon an ambling mule; and
there she cried all on high, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave thy
fighting with thy brother Sir Gareth.  And when he heard her say
so he threw away his shield and his sword, and ran to Sir Gareth,
and took him in his arms, and sithen kneeled down and asked him
mercy.  What are ye, said Sir Gareth, that right now were so
strong and so mighty, and now so suddenly yield you to me?  O
Gareth, I am your brother Sir Gawaine, that for your sake have
had great sorrow and labour.  Then Sir Gareth unlaced his helm,
and kneeled down to him, and asked him mercy.  Then they rose
both, and embraced either other in their arms, and wept a great
while or they might speak, and either of them gave other the
prize of the battle.  And there were many kind words between
them.  Alas, my fair brother, said Sir Gawaine, perdy I owe of
right to worship you an ye were not my brother, for ye have
worshipped King Arthur and all his court, for ye have sent
him[*5] more worshipful knights this twelvemonth than six the
best of the Round Table have done, except Sir Launcelot.

Then came the damosel Savage that was the Lady Linet, that rode
with Sir Gareth so long, and there she did staunch Sir Gareth's
wounds and Sir Gawaine's.  Now what will ye do? said the damosel
Savage; meseemeth that it were well done that Arthur had witting
of you both, for your horses are so bruised that they may not
bear.  Now, fair damosel, said Sir Gawaine, I pray you ride unto
my lord mine uncle, King Arthur, and tell him what adventure is
to me betid here, and I suppose he will not tarry long.  Then she
took her mule, and lightly she came to King Arthur that was but
two mile thence.  And when she had told him tidings the king bade
get him a palfrey.  And when he was upon his back he bade the
lords and ladies come after, who that would; and there was
saddling and bridling of queens' horses and princes' horses, and
well was him that soonest might be ready.

So when the king came thereas they were, he saw Sir Gawaine and
Sir Gareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided
his horse.  And when he came nigh Sir Gareth he would have spoken
but he might not; and therewith he sank down in a swoon for
gladness.  And so they stert unto their uncle, and required him
of his good grace to be of good comfort.  Wit ye well the king
made great joy, and many a piteous complaint he made to Sir
Gareth, and ever he wept as he had been a child.  With that came
his mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame Morgawse, and when she saw
Sir Gareth readily in the visage she might not weep, but suddenly
fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great while like as she had
been dead.  And then Sir Gareth recomforted his mother in such
wise that she recovered and made good cheer.  Then the king
commanded that all manner of knights that were under his
obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of
his nephews.  And so it was done, and all manner of purveyance
purveyed, that there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame
nor wild for gold or silver.  And then by the means of the
damosel Savage Sir Gawaine and Sir Gareth were healed of their
wounds; and there they sojourned eight days.

<273>
Then said King Arthur unto the damosel Savage:  I marvel that
your sister, Dame Lionesse, cometh not here to me, and in
especial that she cometh not to visit her knight, my nephew Sir
Gareth, that hath had so much travail for her love.  My lord,
said the damosel Linet, ye must of your good grace hold her
excused, for she knoweth not that my lord, Sir Gareth, is here. 
Go then for her, said King Arthur, that we may be appointed what
is best to be done, according to the pleasure of my nephew.  Sir,
said the damosel, that shall be done, and so she rode unto her
sister.  And as lightly as she might she made her ready; and she
came on the morn with her brother Sir Gringamore, and with her
forty knights.  And so when she was come she had all the cheer
that might be done, both of the king, and of many other kings and
queens.
