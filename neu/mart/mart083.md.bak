    CHAPTER XXIII

    How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the
    Damosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.

    SIR KNIGHT PELLEAS, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse
    and come forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a
    lady that shall love you.  I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for
    this Lady Ettard hath done me great despite and shame, and there
    he told her the beginning and ending, and how he had purposed
    never to have arisen till that he had been dead.  And now such
    grace God hath sent me, that I hate her as much as ever I loved
    her, thanked be our Lord Jesus!  Thank me, said the Damosel of
    the Lake.  Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his horse, and
    commanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff
    where the Damosel of the Lake would assign.  So the Lady Ettard
    died for sorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir
    Pelleas, and loved together during their life days.
