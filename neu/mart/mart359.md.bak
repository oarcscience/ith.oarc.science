    CHAPTER VI

    How King Arthur had all the knights together for to joust
    in the meadow beside Camelot or they departed.


    Now, said the king, I am sure at this quest of the
    Sangreal shall all ye of the Table Round depart, and never
    shall I see you again whole together; therefore I will see
    you all whole together in the meadow of Camelot to joust
    and to tourney, that after your death men may speak of
    it that such good knights were wholly together such a
    day.  As unto that counsel and at the king's request
    they accorded all, and took on their harness that longed
    unto jousting.  But all this moving of the king was for
    this intent, for to see Galahad proved; for the king
    deemed he should not lightly come again unto the court
    after his departing.  So were they assembled in the
    meadow, both more and less.  Then Sir Galahad, by the
    prayer of the king and the queen, did upon him a noble
    jesseraunce, and also he did on his helm, but shield would
    he take none for no prayer of the king.  And then Sir
    Gawaine and other knights prayed him to take a spear.
    Right so he did; and the queen was in a tower with all
    her ladies, for to behold that tournament.  Then Sir
    Galahad dressed him in midst of the meadow, and began
    to break spears marvellously, that all men had wonder of
    him; for he there surmounted all other knights, for
    within a while he had defouled many good knights of the
    Table Round save twain, that was Sir Launcelot and Sir
    Percivale.
