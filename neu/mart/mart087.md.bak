    CHAPTER XXVII

    How Sir Uwaine fought with two knights and
    overcame them.

    SO was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason
    should be wrought on neither party; so then the knights departed
    and made them ready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer. 
    And on the morn he arose early and heard mass, and brake his
    fast, and so he rode unto the plain without the gates, where
    hoved the two brethren abiding him.  So they rode together
    passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake their spears upon
    Sir Uwaine.  And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he fell over
    his horse and yet his spear brast not.  And then he spurred his
    horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon
    recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and
    bade Sir Uwaine alight and do his battle to the uttermost.  Then
    Sir Uwaine devoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore
    him and drew his sword, and so they dressed together, and either
    gave other such strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir
    Uwaine passing grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he
    should have died.  And thus they fought together five hours as
    men raged out of reason.  And at the last Sir Uwaine smote Sir
    Edward upon the helm such a stroke that his sword carved unto his
    canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his courage, but Sir Uwaine
    pressed fast to have slain him.  That saw Sir Hue: he kneeled
    down and yielded him to Sir Uwaine.  And he of his gentleness
    received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into the
    castle together.  Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and
    the other brother made great sorrow for his brother's death. 
    Then the lady was restored of all her lands, and Sir Hue was
    commanded to be at the court of King Arthur at the next feast of
    Pentecost.  So Sir Uwaine dwelt with the lady nigh half a year,
    for it was <147>long or he might be whole of his great hurts. 
    And so when it drew nigh the term-day that Sir Gawaine, Sir
    Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way, then every
    knight drew him thither to hold his promise that they had made;
    and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them,
    but Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.
