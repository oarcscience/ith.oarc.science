CHAPTER XXXVIII

How Alisander was delivered from Queen Morgan le Fay
by the means of a damosel.


SIR knight, said the damosel, an ye would be merry
I could tell you good tidings.  Well were me, said
Alisander, an I might hear of good tidings, for now I
stand as a prisoner by my promise.  Sir, she said, wit you
well that ye be a prisoner, and worse than ye ween; for
my lady, my cousin Queen Morgan le Fay, keepeth you
here for none other intent but for to do her pleasure with
you when it liketh her.  O Jesu defend me, said Alisander,
from such pleasure; for I had liefer cut away my hangers
than I would do her such pleasure.  As Jesu help me, said
the damosel, an ye would love me and be ruled by me, I
shall make your deliverance with your worship.  Tell me,
said Alisander, by what means, and ye shall have my love.
Fair knight, said she, this castle of right ought to be
mine, and I have an uncle the which is a mighty earl, he is
Earl of Pase, and of all folks he hateth most Morgan le
Fay; and I shall send unto him and pray him for my sake
to destroy this castle for the evil customs that be used
therein; and then will he come and set wild-fire on every
part of the castle, and I shall get you out at a privy
postern, and there shall ye have your horse and your
harness.  Ye say well, damosel, said Alisander.  And then
she said:  Ye may keep the room of this castle this
twelvemonth and a day, then break ye not your oath.
Truly, fair damosel, said Alisander, ye say sooth.  And
then he kissed her, and did to her pleasaunce as it pleased
them both at times and leisures.

So anon she sent unto her uncle and bade him come
and destroy that castle, for as the book saith, he would
have destroyed that castle afore time had not that damosel
been.  When the earl understood her letters he sent her
word again that on such a day he would come and destroy
that castle.  So when that day came she showed Alisander
a postern wherethrough he should flee into a garden, and
there he should find his armour and his horse.  When the
day came that was set, thither came the Earl of Pase with
four hundred knights, and set on fire all the parts of the
castle, that or they ceased they left not a stone standing.
And all this while that the fire was in the castle he abode
in the garden.  And when the fire was done he let make
a cry that he would keep that piece of earth thereas the
castle of La Beale Regard was a twelvemonth and a day,
from all manner knights that would come

So it happed there was a duke that hight Ansirus, and
he was of the kin of Sir Launcelot.  And this knight
was a great pilgrim, for every third year he would be
at Jerusalem.  And because he used all his life to go in
pilgrimage men called him Duke Ansirus the Pilgrim.
And this duke had a daughter that hight Alice, that was
a passing fair woman, and because of her father she was
called Alice la Beale Pilgrim.  And anon as she heard of
this cry she went unto Arthur's court, and said openly in
hearing of many knights, that what knight may overcome
that knight that keepeth that piece of earth shall have me
and all my lands.

When the knights of the Round Table heard her say
thus many were glad, for she was passing fair and of great
rents.  Right so she let cry in castles and towns as fast on
her side as Alisander did on his side.  Then she dressed
her pavilion straight by the piece of the earth that
Alisander kept.  So she was not so soon there but there
came a knight of Arthur's court that hight Sagramore le
Desirous, and he proffered to joust with Alisander; and
they encountered, and Sagramore le Desirous brised his
spear upon Sir Alisander, but Sir Alisander smote him so
hard that he avoided his saddle.  And when La Beale
Alice saw him joust so well, she thought him a passing
goodly knight on horseback.  And then she leapt out of
her pavilion, and took Sir Alisander by the bridle, and
thus she said:  Fair knight, I require thee of thy knighthood
show me thy visage.  I dare well, said Alisander,
show my visage.  And then he put off his helm; and she
saw his visage, she said:  O sweet Jesu, thee I must love,
and never other.  Then show me your visage, said he.
