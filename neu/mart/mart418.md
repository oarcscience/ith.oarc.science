    CHAPTER XII

    How Galahad and Percivale found in a castle many tombs
    of maidens that had bled to death.


    NOW saith the story that all night Galahad and Percivale
    were in a chapel in their prayers, for to save Sir Bors.  So
    on the morrow they dressed them in their harness toward
    the castle, to wit what was fallen of them therein.  And
    when they came there they found neither man nor woman
    that he ne was dead by the vengeance of Our Lord.
    With that they heard a voice that said:  This vengeance
    is for blood-shedding of maidens.  Also they found at the
    end of the chapel a churchyard, and therein might they
    see a three score fair tombs, and that place was so fair and
    so delectable that it seemed them there had been none
    tempest, for there lay the bodies of all the good maidens
    which were martyred for the sick lady's sake.  Also they
    found the names of everych, and of what blood they were
    come, and all were of kings' blood, and twelve of them
    were kings' daughters.  Then they departed and went
    into a forest.  Now, said Percivale unto Galahad, we
    must depart, so pray we Our Lord that we may meet
    together in short time: then they did off their helms and
    kissed together, and wept at their departing.
