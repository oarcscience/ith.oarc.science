    CHAPTER XI

    How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he lost his head
    at the request of a lady.

    WITH that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she might
    drive, and cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor.  What will ye
    with me? said Sir Tor.  I beseech thee, said the damosel, for
    King Arthur's love, give me a gift; I require thee, gentle
    knight, as thou art a gentleman.  Now, said Tor, ask a gift and I
    will give it you.  Gramercy, said the damosel; now I ask the head
    of the false knight Abelleus, for he is the most outrageous
    knight that liveth, and the greatest murderer.  I am loath, said
    Sir Tor, of that gift I have given you; let him make amends in
    that he hath trespassed unto you.  Now, said the damosel, he may
    not, for he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was
    a better knight than he, an he had had grace; and I kneeled half
    an hour afore him in the mire for to save my brother's life, that
    had done him no damage, but fought with him by adventure of arms,
    and so for all that I could do he struck off his head; wherefore
    I require thee, <94>as thou art a true knight, to give me my
    gift, or else I shall shame thee in all the court of King Arthur;
    for he is the falsest knight living, and a great destroyer of
    good knights.  Then when Abelleus heard this, he was more afeard,
    and yielded him and asked mercy.  I may not now, said Sir Tor,
    but if I should be found false of my promise; for while I would
    have taken you to mercy ye would none ask, but if ye had the
    brachet again, that was my quest.  And therewith he took off his
    helm, and he arose and fled, and Sir Tor after him, and smote off
    his head quite.

    Now sir, said the damosel, it is near night; I pray you come and
    lodge with me here at my place, it is here fast by.  I will well,
    said Sir Tor, for his horse and he had fared evil since they
    departed from Camelot, and so he rode with her, and had passing
    good cheer with her; and she had a passing fair old knight to her
    husband that made him passing good cheer, and well eased both his
    horse and him.  And on the morn he heard his mass, and brake his
    fast, and took his leave of the knight and of the lady, that
    besought him to tell them his name.  Truly, he said, my name is
    Sir Tor that was late made knight, and this was the first quest
    of arms that ever I did, to bring again that this knight Abelleus
    took away from King Arthur's court.  O fair knight, said the lady
    and her husband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our
    poor lodging, and it shall be always at your commandment.  So Sir
    Tor departed and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and
    the king and the queen and all the court was passing fain of his
    coming, and made great joy that he was come again; for he went
    from the court with little succour, but as King Pellinore his
    father gave him an old courser, and King Arthur gave him armour
    and a sword, and else had he none other succour, but rode so
    forth himself alone.  And then the king and the queen by Merlin's
    advice made him to swear to tell of his adventures, and so he
    told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore rehearsed,
    wherefore the king and the queen made great joy.  Nay, nay, said
    Merlin, these be but japes to that he shall do; for he shall
    prove a noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living,
    <95>and gentle and courteous, and of good tatches, and passing
    true of his promise, and never shall outrage.  Wherethrough
    Merlin's words King Arthur gave him an earldom of lands that fell
    unto him.  And here endeth the quest of Sir Tor, King Pellinore's
    son.
