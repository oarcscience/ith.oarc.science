    CHAPTER VII

    Of the opinion of some men of the death of King Arthur;
    and how Queen Guenever made her a nun in Almesbury


    YET some men say in many parts of England that King
    Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our Lord Jesu
    into another place; and men say that he shall come again,
    and he shall win the holy cross.  I will not say it shall be
    so, but rather I will say: here in this world he changed
    his life.  But many men say that there is written upon his
    tomb this verse:   Thus leave I here Sir Bedivere with the
    hermit, that dwelled that time in a chapel beside Glastonbury,
    and there was his hermitage.  And so they lived in
    their prayers, and fastings, and great abstinence.  And
    when Queen Guenever understood that King Arthur was
    slain, and all the noble knights, Sir Mordred and all the
    remnant, then the queen stole away, and five ladies with
    her, and so she went to Almesbury; and there she let
    make herself a nun, and ware white clothes and black,
    and great penance she took, as ever did sinful lady in this
    land, and never creature could make her merry; but lived
    in fasting, prayers, and alms-deeds, that all manner of
    people marvelled how virtuously she was changed.  Now
    leave we Queen Guenever in Almesbury, a nun in white
    clothes and black, and there she was Abbess and ruler
    as reason would; and turn we from her, and speak we of
    Sir Launcelot du Lake.
