    CHAPTER XXXV

    How Sir Tristram was holpen by his men, and of Queen
    Isoud which was put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt.

    SO when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir
    Sentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram's men, sought their
    master.  When they heard he was escaped then they were passing
    glad; and on the rocks they found him, and with towels they
    pulled him up.  And then Sir Tristram asked them where was La
    Beale Isoud, for he weened she had been had away of Andred's
    people.  Sir, said Gouvernail, she is put in a lazar-cote.  Alas,
    said Sir <338>Tristram, this is a full ungoodly place for such a
    fair lady, and if I may she shall not be long there.  And so he
    took his men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and fetched her
    away, and brought her into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir
    Tristram there abode with her.  So the good knight bade his men
    go from him:  For at this time I may not help you.  So they
    departed all save Gouvernail.  And so upon a day Sir Tristram
    yede into the forest for to disport him, and then it happened
    that there he fell sleep; and there came a man that Sir Tristram
    aforehand had slain his brother, and when this man had found him
    he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow, and Sir Tristram
    leapt up and killed that man.  And in the meantime it was told
    King Mark how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in that same
    manor, and as soon as ever he might thither he came with many
    knights to slay Sir Tristram.  And when he came there he found
    him gone; and there he took La Beale Isoud home with him, and
    kept her strait that by no means never she might wit nor send
    unto Tristram, nor he unto her.  And then when Sir Tristram came
    toward the old manor he found the track of many horses, and
    thereby he wist his lady was gone.  And then Sir Tristram took
    great sorrow, and endured with great pain long time, for the
    arrow that he was hurt withal was envenomed.

    Then by the mean of La Beale Isoud she told a lady that was
    cousin unto Dame Bragwaine, and she came to Sir Tristram, and
    told him that he might not be whole by no means.  For thy lady,
    La Beale Isoud, may not help thee, therefore she biddeth you
    haste into Brittany to King Howel, and there ye shall find his
    daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she shall help thee.  Then
    Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping, and so sailed into
    Brittany.  And when King Howel wist that it was Sir Tristram he
    was full glad of him.  Sir, he said, I am come into this country
    to have help of your daughter, for it is told me that there is
    none other may heal me but she; and so within a while she healed
    him.
