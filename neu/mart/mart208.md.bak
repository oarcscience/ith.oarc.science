    CHAPTER XIV

    How Sir Meliagaunce told for what cause they fought,
    and how Sir Lamorak jousted with King Arthur.

    SIR, said Meliagaunce, I shall tell you for what cause we do this
    battle.  I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the
    fairest lady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for
    he said Queen Morgawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of
    beauty.  Ah, Sir Lamorak, why sayest thou so? it is not thy part
    to dispraise thy princess that thou art under her obeissance, and
    we all.  And therewith he alighted on foot, and said:  For this
    quarrel, make thee ready, for I will prove upon thee that Queen
    Guenever is the fairest lady and most of bounty in the world. 
    Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado with you in this
    quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest; and though
    I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth; for
    though my lady Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye
    well Queen Morgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so
    every knight thinketh his own lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir,
    ye are the man in the world except Sir Tristram that I am most
    loathest to have ado withal, but, an ye will needs fight with me
    I shall endure you as long as I may.  Then spake Sir Bleoberis
    and said:  My lord Sir Launcelot, I wist you never so misadvised
    as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you but reason and
    knightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh that she
    is the fairest lady of the world.  Were this a great reason that
    ye <374>should be wroth with me for such language?  And well ye
    wot, that Sir Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know, and he hath
    ought you and us ever good will, and therefore I pray you be good
    friends.  Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak.  I pray you
    forgive me mine evil will, and if I was misadvised I will amend
    it.  Sir, said Sir Lamorak, the amends is soon made betwixt you
    and me.  And so Sir Launcelot and Sir Bleoberis departed, and Sir
    Meliagaunce and Sir Lamorak took their horses, and either
    departed from other.

    And within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak,
    and jousted with him; and there he smote down Sir Lamorak, and
    wounded him sore with a spear, and so he rode from him; wherefore
    Sir Lamorak was wroth that he would not fight with him on foot,
    howbeit that Sir Lamorak knew not King Arthur.
