    CHAPTER XXIV

    How King Arthur pardoned them, and demanded of them
    where Sir Gareth was.

    THEN goodly they said all at once, God forgive you, and we do,
    and pray you that ye will tell us where we may find Sir
    Beaumains.  Fair lords, said Sir Ironside, I cannot tell you, for
    it is full hard to find him; for such young knights as he is one,
    when they be in their adventures be never abiding in no place. 
    But to say the worship that the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and
    Sir Persant and his brother said of Beaumains, it was marvel to
    hear.  Well, my fair lords, said King Arthur, wit you well I
    shall do you honour for the love of Sir Beaumains, and as soon as
    ever I meet with him I shall make you all upon one <254>day
    knights of the Table Round.  And as to thee, Sir Persant of Inde,
    thou hast been ever called a full noble knight, and so have ever
    been thy three brethren called.  But I marvel, said the king,
    that I hear not of the Black Knight your brother, he was a full
    noble knight.  Sir, said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, Sir
    Beaumains slew him in a recounter with his spear, his name was
    Sir Percard.  That was great pity, said the king, and so said
    many knights.  For these four brethren were full well known in
    the court of King Arthur for noble knights, for long time they
    had holden war against the knights of the Round Table.  Then said
    Pertolepe, the Green Knight, to the king:  At a passage of the
    water of Mortaise there encountered Sir Beaumains with two
    brethren that ever for the most part kept that passage, and they
    were two deadly knights, and there he slew the eldest brother in
    the water, and smote him upon the head such a buffet that he fell
    down in the water, and there he was drowned, and his name was Sir
    Gherard le Breusse; and after he slew the other brother upon the
    land, his name was Sir Arnold le Breusse.
