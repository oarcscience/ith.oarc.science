    CHAPTER IV

    How the hermit expounded to Sir Launcelot his advision, and
    told him that Sir Galahad was his son.


    LO, Sir Launcelot, said the good man, there thou mightest
    understand the high lineage that thou art come of, and
    thine advision betokeneth.  After the passion of Jesu
    Christ forty year, Joseph of Aramathie preached the victory
    of King Evelake, that he had in the battles the better of
    his enemies.  And of the seven kings and the two knights:
    the first of them is called Nappus, an holy man; and the
    second hight Nacien, in remembrance of his grandsire, and
    in him dwelled our Lord Jesu Christ; and the third was
    called Helias le Grose; and the fourth hight Lisais; and
    the fifth hight Jonas, he departed out of his country and
    went into Wales, and took there the daughter of Manuel,
    whereby he had the land of Gaul, and he came to dwell in
    this country.  And of him came King Launcelot thy
    grandsire, the which there wedded the king's daughter of
    Ireland, and he was as worthy a man as thou art, and of
    him came King Ban, thy father, the which was the last of
    the seven kings.  And by thee, Sir Launcelot, it signifieth
    that the angels said thou were none of the seven fellowships.
    And the last was the ninth knight, he was signified
    to a lion, for he should pass all manner of earthly knights,
    that is Sir Galahad, the which thou gat on King Pelles'
    daughter; and thou ought to thank God more than any
    other man living, for of a sinner earthly thou hast no peer
    as in knighthood, nor never shall be.  But little thank hast
    thou given to God for all the great virtues that God hath
    lent thee.  Sir, said Launcelot, ye say that that good
    knight is my son.  That oughtest thou to know and no
    man better, said the good man, for thou knewest the
    daughter of King Pelles fleshly, and on her thou begattest
    Galahad, and that was he that at the feast of Pentecost sat
    in the Siege Perilous; and therefore make thou it known
    openly that he is one of thy begetting on King Pelles'
    daughter, for that will be your worship and honour, and to
    all thy kindred.  And I counsel you in no place press not
    upon him to have ado with him.  Well, said Launcelot,
    meseemeth that good knight should pray for me unto the
    High Father, that I fall not to sin again.  Trust thou
    well, said the good man, thou farest mickle the better for
    his prayer; but the son shall not bear the wickedness of
    the father, nor the father shall not bear the wickedness of
    the son, but everych shall bear his own burden.  And
    therefore beseek thou only God, and He will help thee in
    all thy needs.  And then Sir Launcelot and he went to
    supper, and so laid him to rest, and the hair pricked so Sir
    Launcelot's skin which grieved him full sore, but he took
    it meekly, and suffered the pain.  And so on the morn
    he heard his mass and took his arms, and so took his
    leave.
