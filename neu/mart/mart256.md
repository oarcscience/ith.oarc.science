    CHAPTER XIX

    How Sir Lamorak jousted with Sir Palomides, and hurt
    him grievously.


    THEN Palomides rode fast till he came nigh him.  And
    then he said:  Knight, remember ye of the shame ye
    did to me right now at the castle, therefore dress thee,
    for I will have ado with thee.  Fair knight, said he to
    Palomides, of me ye win no worship, for ye have seen this
    day that I have been travailed sore.  As for that, said
    Palomides, I will not let, for wit ye well I will be revenged.
    Well, said the knight, I may happen to endure you.  And
    therewithal he mounted upon his horse, and took a great
    spear in his hand ready for to joust.  Nay, said Palomides,
    I will not joust, for I am sure at jousting I get no prize.
    Fair knight, said that knight, it would beseem a knight to
    joust and to fight on horseback.  Ye shall see what I will
    do, said Palomides.  And therewith he alighted down
    upon foot, and dressed his shield afore him and pulled
    out his sword.  Then the Knight with the Red Shield
    descended down from his horse, and dressed his shield
    afore him, and so he drew out his sword.  And then they
    came together a soft pace, and wonderly they lashed
    together passing thick the mountenance of an hour or
    ever they breathed.  Then they traced and traversed, and
    waxed wonderly wroth, and either behight other death;
    they hewed so fast with their swords that they cut in down
    half their swords and mails, that the bare flesh in some
    place stood above their harness.  And when Sir Palomides
    beheld his fellow's sword over-hylled with his blood it
    grieved him sore: some while they foined, some while
    they struck as wild men.  But at the last Sir Palomides
    waxed faint, because of his first wound that he had at the
    castle with a spear, for that wound grieved him wonderly
    sore.  Fair knight, said Palomides, meseemeth we have
    assayed either other passing sore, and if it may please
    thee, I require thee of thy knighthood tell me thy name.
    Sir, said the knight to Palomides, that is me loath to do,
    for thou hast done me wrong and no knighthood to proffer
    me battle, considering my great travail, but an thou wilt
    tell me thy name I will tell thee mine.  Sir, said he, wit
    thou well my name is Palomides.  Ah, sir, ye shall understand
    my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son and heir unto
    the good knight and king, King Pellinore, and Sir Tor,
    the good knight, is my half brother.  When Sir Palomides
    heard him say so he kneeled down and asked mercy, For
    outrageously have I done to you this day; considering
    the great deeds of arms I have seen you do, shamefully
    and unknightly I have required you to do battle.  Ah, Sir
    Palomides, said Sir Lamorak, overmuch have ye done and
    said to me.  And therewith he embraced him with his
    both hands, and said:  Palomides, the worthy knight, in
    all this land is no better than ye, nor more of prowess,
    and me repenteth sore that we should fight together.  So
    it doth not me, said Sir Palomides, and yet am I sorer
    wounded than ye be; but as for that I shall soon thereof
    be whole.  But certainly I would not for the fairest castle
    in this land, but if thou and I had met, for I shall love
    you the days of my life afore all other knights except my
    brother, Sir Safere.  I say the same, said Sir Lamorak,
    except my brother, Sir Tor.  Then came Sir Dinadan,
    and he made great joy of Sir Lamorak.  Then their
    squires dressed both their shields and their harness, and
    stopped their wounds.  And thereby at a priory they
    rested them all night.
