CHAPTER XLVIII

Of the sixth day, and what then was done.


HERE beginneth the sixth day.  Then came therein Sir
Gaheris, and there encountered with him Sir Ossaise of
Surluse, and Sir Gaheris smote him over his horse's croup.
And then either party encountered with other, and there
were many spears broken, and many knights cast under
feet.  So there came in Sir Dornard and Sir Aglovale,
that were brethren unto Sir Lamorak, and they met with
other two knights, and either smote other so hard that
all four knights and horses fell to the earth.  When Sir
Lamorak saw his two brethren down he was wroth out of
measure, and then he gat a great spear in his hand, and
therewithal he smote down four good knights, and then
his spear brake.  Then he pulled out his sword, and
smote about him on the right hand and on the left hand,
and raced off helms and pulled down knights, that all
men marvelled of such deeds of arms as he did, for he
fared so that many knights fled.  Then he horsed his
brethren again, and said:  Brethren, ye ought to be
ashamed to fall so off your horses! what is a knight
but when he is on horseback?  I set not by a knight
when he is on foot, for all battles on foot are but pillers'
battles.  For there should no knight fight on foot but
if it were for treason, or else he were driven thereto by
force; therefore, brethren, sit fast on your horses, or else
fight never more afore me.

With that came in the Duke Chaleins of Clarance,
and there encountered with him the Earl Ulbawes of
Surluse, and either of them smote other down.  Then
the knights of both parties horsed their lords again, for
Sir Ector and Bleoberis were on foot, waiting on the
Duke Chaleins.  And the King with the Hundred Knights
was with the Earl of Ulbawes.  With that came Gaheris
and lashed to the King with the Hundred Knights, and
he to him again.  Then came the Duke Chaleins and
departed them.

Then they blew to lodging, and the knights unarmed
them and drew them to their dinner; and at the midst
of their dinner in came Dinadan and began to rail.  Then
he beheld the haut prince, that seemed wroth with some
fault that he saw; for he had a custom he loved no fish,
and because he was served with fish, the which he hated,
therefore he was not merry.  When Sir Dinadan had
espied the haut prince, he espied where was a fish with a
great head, and that he gat betwixt two dishes, and
served the haut prince with that fish.  And then he said
thus:  Sir Galahalt, well may I liken you to a wolf, for
he will never eat fish, but flesh; then the haut prince
laughed at his words.  Well, well, said Dinadan to
Launcelot, what devil do ye in this country, for here may
no mean knights win no worship for thee.  Sir Dinadan,
said Launcelot, I ensure thee I shall no more meet with
thee nor with thy great spear, for I may not sit in my
saddle when that spear hitteth me.  And if I be happy I
shall beware of that boistous body that thou bearest.
Well, said Launcelot, make good watch ever:  God
forbid that ever we meet but if it be at a dish of meat.
Then laughed the queen and the haut prince, that they
might not sit at their table; thus they made great joy
till on the morn, and then they heard mass, and blew to
field.  And Queen Guenever and all the estates were set,
and judges armed clean with their shields to keep the
right.
