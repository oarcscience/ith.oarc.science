    CHAPTER XXXVII

    How Sir Suppinabiles told Sir Tristram how he was defamed
    in the court of King Arthur, and of Sir Lamorak.

    THEN departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he
    found Sir Tristram, and told him that he had been in King
    Arthur's court.  Then said Sir Tristram:  Heard ye anything of
    me?  So God me help, said Sir Suppinabiles, there I heard Sir
    Launcelot speak of you great shame, and that ye be a false knight
    to your lady and he bade me do you to wit that he will be your
    mortal enemy in every place where he may meet you.  That me
    repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in his
    fellowship.  So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that
    noble knights should defame him for the sake of his lady.  And in
    this meanwhile La Beale <341>Isoud made a letter unto Queen
    Guenever, complaining her of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how
    he had wedded the king's daughter of Brittany.  Queen Guenever
    sent her another letter, and bade her be of good cheer, for she
    should have joy after sorrow, for Sir Tristram was so noble a
    knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies would make such
    noble men to wed them.  But in the end, Queen Guenever said, it
    shall be thus, that he shall hate her, and love you better than
    ever he did to-fore.

    So leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak
    de Galis, that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished
    all, save Sir Lamorak and his squire; and there he swam mightily,
    and fishers of the Isle of Servage took him up, and his squire
    was drowned, and the shipmen had great labour to save Sir
    Lamorak's life, for all the comfort that they could do.

    And the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great
    mighty giant.  And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King
    Arthur's, and in no wise he would do them favour.  And these
    fishers told Sir Lamorak all the guise of Sir Nabon; how there
    came never knight of King Arthur's but he destroyed him.  And at
    the last battle that he did was slain Sir Nanowne le Petite, the
    which he put to a shameful death in despite of King Arthur, for
    he was drawn limb-meal.  That forthinketh me, said Sir Lamorak,
    for that knight's death, for he was my cousin; and if I were at
    mine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his death. 
    Peace, said the fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye
    depart from hence Sir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or
    else we should die for your sake.  So that I be whole, said
    Lamorak, of my disease that I have taken in the sea, I will that
    ye tell him that I am a knight of King Arthur's, for I was never
    afeard to reneye my lord.
