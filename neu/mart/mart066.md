    CHAPTER VI

    How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul,
    chased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.

    THEN it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode a-hunting
    into a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and
    Sir Accolon of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were
    well horsed, and so they chased so fast that within a while they
    three were then ten mile from their fellowship.  And at the last
    they chased so sore that they slew their horses underneath them. 
    Then were they all three on foot, and ever they saw the hart
    afore them passing weary and enbushed.  What will we do? said
    King Arthur, we are hard bestead.  Let us go on foot, said King
    Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging.  Then were they ware
    of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting
    on his throat, and more other hounds came after.  Then King
    Arthur blew the prise and dight the hart.

    Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a
    great water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the
    water, and the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands. 
    Then Arthur went to the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly
    creature therein.  Sirs, said the king, come thence, and let us
    see what is in this ship.  So they went in all three, and found
    it richly behanged with cloth of silk.  By then it was dark
    night, and there suddenly were about them an hundred torches set
    upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave great light;
    and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and saluted
    King Arthur on their knees, and called him by his name, and said
    he was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have
    of the best.  The king thanked them fair.  Therewithal they led
    the king and his two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a
    cloth laid, richly beseen of all that longed unto a table, and
    there <111>were they served of all wines and meats that they
    could think; of that the king had great marvel, for he fared
    never better in his life as for one supper.  And so when they had
    supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a chamber, a
    richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King Uriens
    served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was
    led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so
    they were laid in their beds easily.  And anon they fell asleep,
    and slept marvellously sore all the night.  And on the morrow
    King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his wife's arms, Morgan le
    Fay.  And when he awoke he had great marvel, how he came there,
    for on the even afore he was two days' journey from Camelot.  And
    when King Arthur awoke he found himself in a dark prison, hearing
    about him many complaints of woful knights.
