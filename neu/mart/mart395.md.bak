    CHAPTER VI

    How Sir Bors met with an hermit, and how he was confessed
    to him, and of his penance enjoined to him.


    WHEN Bors was departed from Camelot he met with a
    religious man riding on an ass, and Sir Bors saluted him.
    Anon the good man knew him that he was one of the
    knights-errant that was in the quest of the Sangreal.
    What are ye? said the good man.  Sir, said he, I am
    a knight that fain would be counselled in the quest of the
    Sangreal, for he shall have much earthly worship that may
    bring it to an end.  Certes, said the good man, that is sooth,
    for he shall be the best knight of the world, and the fairest
    of all the fellowship.  But wit you well there shall none
    attain it but by cleanness, that is pure confession.

    So rode they together till that they came to an hermitage.
    And there he prayed Bors to dwell all that night
    with him.  And so he alighted and put away his armour,
    and prayed him that he might be confessed; and so they
    went into the chapel, and there he was clean confessed, and
    they ate bread and drank water together.  Now, said the
    good man, I pray thee that thou eat none other till that
    thou sit at the table where the Sangreal shall be.  Sir, said
    he, I agree me thereto, but how wit ye that I shall sit
    there.  Yes, said the good man, that know I, but there
    shall be but few of your fellows with you.  All is welcome,
    said Sir Bors, that God sendeth me.  Also, said the good
    man, instead of a shirt, and in sign of chastisement, ye
    shall wear a garment; therefore I pray you do off all your
    clothes and your shirt: and so he did.  And then he took
    him a scarlet coat, so that should be instead of his shirt till
    he had fulfilled the quest of the Sangreal; and the good
    man found in him so marvellous a life and so stable, that
    he marvelled and felt that he was never corrupt in fleshly
    lusts, but in one time that he begat Elian le Blank.

    Then he armed him, and took his leave, and so
    departed.  And so a little from thence he looked up into
    a tree, and there he saw a passing great bird upon an old
    tree, and it was passing dry, without leaves; and the bird
    sat above, and had birds, the which were dead for hunger.
    So smote he himself with his beak, the which was great
    and sharp.  And so the great bird bled till that he died
    among his birds.  And the young birds took the life by
    the blood of the great bird.  When Bors saw this he wist
    well it was a great tokening; for when he saw the great
    bird arose not, then he took his horse and yede his way.
    So by evensong, by adventure he came to a strong tower
    and an high, and there was he lodged gladly.
