    CHAPTER I
    How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court,
    and how Sir Lionel left him sleeping and was taken.

    SOON after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then
    all the knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and
    made many jousts and tournaments, and some there were that were
    but knights, which increased so in arms and worship that they
    passed all their fellows in prowess and noble deeds, and that was
    well proved on many; but in especial it was proved on Sir
    Launcelot du Lake, for in all tournaments and jousts and deeds of
    arms, both for life and death, he passed all other knights, and
    at no time he was never overcome but if it were by treason or
    enchantment; so Sir Launcelot increased so marvellously in
    worship, and in honour, therefore is he the first knight that the
    French book maketh mention of after King Arthur came from Rome. 
    Wherefore Queen Guenever had him in great favour above all other
    knights, and in certain he loved the queen again above all other
    ladies and damosels of his life, and for her he did many deeds of
    arms, and saved her from the fire through his noble chivalry.

    Thus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game.  And then
    he thought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then
    he bade his nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him ready; for we two
    will seek adventures.  So they mounted on their horses, armed at
    all rights, and <176>rode into a deep forest and so into a deep
    plain.  And then the weather was hot about noon, and Sir
    Launcelot had great lust to sleep.  Then Sir Lionel espied a
    great apple-tree that stood by an hedge, and said, Brother,
    yonder is a fair shadow, there may we rest us [and] our horses. 
    It is well said, fair brother, said Sir Launcelot, for this eight
    year I was not so sleepy as I am now; and so they there alighted
    and tied their horses unto sundry trees, and so Sir Launcelot
    laid him down under an appletree, and his helm he laid under his
    head.  And Sir Lionel waked while he slept.  So Sir Launcelot was
    asleep passing fast.

    And in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast
    fleeing as ever they might ride.  And there followed them three
    but one knight.  And when Sir Lionel saw him, him thought he saw
    never so great a knight, nor so well faring a man, neither so
    well apparelled unto all rights.  So within a while this strong
    knight had overtaken one of these knights, and there he smote him
    to the cold earth that he lay still.  And then he rode unto the
    second knight, and smote him so that man and horse fell down. 
    And then straight to the third knight he rode, and smote him
    behind his horse's arse a spear length.  And then he alighted
    down and reined his horse on the bridle, and bound all the three
    knights fast with the reins of their own bridles.  When Sir
    Lionel saw him do thus, he thought to assay him, and made him
    ready, and stilly and privily he took his horse, and thought not
    for to awake Sir Launcelot.  And when he was mounted upon his
    horse, he overtook this strong knight, and bade him turn, and the
    other smote Sir Lionel so hard that horse and man he bare to the
    earth, and so he alighted down and bound him fast, and threw him
    overthwart his own horse, and so he served them all four, and
    rode with them away to his own castle.  And when he came there he
    gart unarm them, and beat them with thorns all naked, and after
    put them in a deep prison where were many more knights, that made
    great dolour.
