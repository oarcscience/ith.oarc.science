    CHAPTER XL

    How after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir
    Dinadan had been long in prison they were delivered.

    NOW leave we off this tale, and speak we of sir Dinas that had
    within the castle a paramour, and she loved <425>another knight
    better than him.  And so when sir Dinas went out a-hunting she
    slipped down by a towel, and took with her two brachets, and so
    she yede to the knight that she loved, and he her again.  And
    when sir Dinas came home and missed his paramour and his
    brachets, then was he the more wrother for his brachets than for
    the lady.  So then he rode after the knight that had his
    paramour, and bade him turn and joust.  So sir Dinas smote him
    down, that with the fall he brake his leg and his arm.  And then
    his lady and paramour cried sir Dinas mercy, and said she would
    love him better than ever she did.  Nay, said sir Dinas, I shall
    never trust them that once betrayed me, and therefore, as ye have
    begun, so end, for I will never meddle with you.  And so sir
    Dinas departed, and took his brachets with him, and so rode to
    his castle.

    Now will we turn unto sir Launcelot, that was right heavy that he
    could never hear no tidings of sir Tristram, for all this while
    he was in prison with sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan.  Then
    Dame Bragwaine took her leave to go into Cornwall, and sir
    Launcelot, sir Kay, and sir Gaheris rode to seek sir Tristram in
    the country of Surluse.

    Now speaketh this tale of sir Tristram and of his two fellows,
    for every day sir Palomides brawled and said language against sir
    Tristram.  I marvel, said sir Dinadan, of thee, sir Palomides, an
    thou haddest sir Tristram here thou wouldst do him no harm; for
    an a wolf and a sheep were together in a prison the wolf would
    suffer the sheep to be in peace.  And wit thou well, said sir
    Dinadan, this same is sir Tristram at a word, and now must thou
    do thy best with him, and let see now if ye can skift it with
    your hands.  Then was sir Palomides abashed and said little.  Sir
    Palomides, then said sir Tristram, I have heard much of your
    maugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this time
    by my will, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us
    in governance; for an I dread him not more than I do thee, soon
    it should be skift: so they peaced themself.  Right so came in a
    damosel and
    said:  Knights, be of good cheer, for ye are sure of your
    <426>lives, and that I heard say my lord, Sir Darras.  Then were
    they glad all three, for daily they weened they should have died.

    Then soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he weened to
    have died; then Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides under
    them both making great sorrow.  So a damosel came in to them and
    found them mourning.  Then she went unto Sir Darras, and told him
    how that mighty knight that bare the black shield was likely to
    die.  That shall not be, said Sir Darras, for God defend when
    knights come to me for succour that I should suffer them to die
    within my prison.  Therefore, said Sir Darras to the damosel,
    fetch that knight and his fellows afore me.  And then anon Sir
    Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him.  He said:  Sir knight,
    me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble
    knight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye well it shall never
    be said that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou
    art in prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons
    whereby I was greatly aggrieved.  But now shalt thou go and thy
    fellows, and your harness and horses have been fair and clean
    kept, and ye shall go where it liketh you, upon this covenant,
    that thou, knight, wilt promise me to be good friend to my sons
    two that be now alive, and also that thou tell me thy name.  Sir,
    said he, as for me my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and in
    Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark.  And as for
    the death of your sons I might not do withal, for an they had
    been the next kin that I have I might have done none otherwise. 
    And if I had slain them by treason or treachery I had been worthy
    to have died.  All this I consider, said Sir Darras, that all
    that ye did was by force of knighthood, and that was the cause I
    would not put you to death.  But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the
    good knight, I pray you heartily to be my good friend and to my
    sons.  Sir, said Sir Tristram, I promise you by the faith of my
    body, ever while I live I will do you service, for ye have done
    to us but as a natural knight ought to do.  Then Sir Tristram
    reposed him there till that he was <427>amended of his sickness;
    and when he was big and strong they took their leave, and every
    knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till
    they came to a cross way.  Now fellows, said Sir Tristram, here
    will we depart in sundry ways.  And because Sir Dinadan had the
    first adventure of him I will begin.
