    CHAPTER XIX

    How King Arthur rode to Carlion, and of his dream,
    and how he saw the questing beast.

    THEN after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King
    Arthur rode into Carlion.  And thither came to him, King Lot's
    wife, of Orkney, in manner of a message, but she was sent thither
    to espy the court of King Arthur; and she came richly beseen,
    with her four sons, Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with
    many other knights and ladies.  For she was a passing fair lady,
    therefore the king cast great love unto her, and desired to lie
    by her; so they were agreed, and he begat upon her Mordred, and
    she was his sister, on his mother's side, Igraine.  So there she
    rested her a month, and at the last departed.  Then the king
    dreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread.  But all
    this time King Arthur knew not that King Lot's wife was his
    sister.  Thus was the dream of Arthur:  Him thought there was
    come into this land griffins and serpents, and him thought they
    burnt and slew all the people in the land, and then him thought
    he fought with them, and they did him passing great harm, and
    wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew them.  When the
    king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so to put it
    out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride a-
    hunting.  As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great
    hart afore him.  This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so
    he spurred the horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force
    oft he <36>was like to have smitten the hart; whereas the king
    had chased the hart so long, that his horse lost his breath, and
    fell down dead.  Then a yeoman fetched the king another horse.

    So the king saw the hart enbushed, and his horse dead, he set him
    down by a fountain, and there he fell in great thoughts.  And as
    he sat so, him thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of
    thirty.  And with that the king saw coming toward him the
    strangest beast that ever he saw or heard of; so the beast went
    to the well and drank, and the noise was in the beast's belly
    like unto the questing of thirty couple hounds; but all the while
    the beast drank there was no noise in the beast's belly: and
    there.with the beast departed with a great noise, whereof the
    king had great marvel.  And so he was in a great thought, and
    therewith he fell asleep.  Right so there came a knight afoot
    unto Arthur and said, Knight full of thought and sleepy, tell me
    if thou sawest a strange beast pass this way.  Such one saw I,
    said King Arthur, that is past two mile; what would ye with the
    beast? said Arthur.  Sir, I have followed that beast long time,
    and killed mine horse, so would God I had another to follow my
    quest.  Right so came one with the king's horse, and when the
    knight saw the horse, he prayed the king to give him the horse:
    for I have followed this quest this twelvemonth, and either I
    shall achieve him, or bleed of the best blood of my body. 
    Pellinore, that time king, followed the Questing Beast, and after
    his death Sir Palamides followed it.
