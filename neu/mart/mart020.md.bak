    CHAPTER XXI

    How Ulfius impeached Queen Igraine, Arthur's mother, of treason;
    and how a knight came and desired to have the death of his master
    revenged.

    RIGHT SO came Ulfius, and said openly, that the king and all
    might hear that were feasted that day, Ye are the falsest lady of
    the world, and the most traitress unto the king's person. 
    Beware, said Arthur, what thou sayest; thou speakest a great
    word.  I am well ware, said Ulfius, what I speak, and here is my
    glove to prove it upon any man that will say the contrary, that
    this Queen Igraine is causer of your great damage, and of your
    great war.  For, an she would have uttered it in the life of King
    Uther Pendragon, of the birth of you, and how ye were begotten ye
    had never had the mortal wars that ye have had; for the most part
    of your barons of your realm knew never whose son ye were, nor of
    whom ye were begotten; and she that bare you of her body should
    have made it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours,
    and in like <39>wise to all the realm, wherefore I prove her
    false to God and to you and to all your realm, and who will say
    the contrary I will prove it on his body.

    Then spake Igraine and said, I am a woman and I may not fight,
    but rather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good
    man take my quarrel.  More, she said, Merlin knoweth well, and ye
    Sir Ulfius, how King Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagil
    in the likeness of my lord, that was dead three hours to-fore,
    and thereby gat a child that night upon me.  And after the
    thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and by his commandment when
    the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin and nourished by
    him, and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not what is his
    name, for I knew him never yet.  And there, Ulfius said to the
    queen, Merlin is more to blame than ye.  Well I wot, said the
    queen, I bare a child by my lord King Uther, but I wot not where
    he is become.  Then Merlin took the king by the hand, saying,
    This is your mother.  And therewith Sir Ector bare witness how he
    nourished him by Uther's commandment.  And therewith King Arthur
    took his mother, Queen Igraine, in his arms and kissed her, and
    either wept upon other.  And then the king let make a feast that
    lasted eight days.

    Then on a day there came in the court a squire on horseback,
    leading a knight before him wounded to the death, and told him
    how there was a knight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by
    a well, and hath slain my master, a good knight, his name was
    Miles; wherefore I beseech you that my master may be buried, and
    that some knight may revenge my master's death.  Then the noise
    was great of that knight's death in the court, and every man said
    his advice.  Then came Griflet that was but a squire, and he was
    but young, of the age of the king Arthur, so he besought the king
    for all his service that he had done him to give the order of
    knighthood.
