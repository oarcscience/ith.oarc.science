    CHAPTER VI

    Of the great danger that Sir Percivale was in by his horse,
    and how he saw a serpent and a lion fight.


    AND when Sir Percivale came nigh the brim, and saw the
    water so boistous, he doubted to overpass it.  And then
    he made a sign of the cross in his forehead.  When the
    fiend felt him so charged he shook off Sir Percivale, and
    he went into the water crying and roaring, making great
    sorrow, and it seemed unto him that the water brent.
    Then Sir Percivale perceived it was a fiend, the which
    would have brought him unto his perdition.  Then he
    commended himself unto God, and prayed Our Lord to keep
    him from all such temptations; and so he prayed all that
    night till on the morn that it was day; then he saw that
    he was in a wild mountain the which was closed with the
    sea nigh all about, that he might see no land about him
    which might relieve him, but wild beasts.

    And then he went into a valley, and there he saw a
    young serpent bring a young lion by the neck, and so he
    came by Sir Percivale.  With that came a great lion
    crying and roaring after the serpent.  And as fast as Sir
    Percivale saw this he marvelled, and hied him thither, but
    anon the lion had overtaken the serpent and began battle
    with him.  And then Sir Percivale thought to help the
    lion, for he was the more natural beast of the two; and
    therewith he drew his sword, and set his shield afore him,
    and there he gave the serpent such a buffet that he had
    a deadly wound.  When the lion saw that, he made no
    resemblaunt to fight with him, but made him all the
    cheer that a beast might make a man.  Then Percivale
    perceived that, and cast down his shield which was broken;
    and then he did off his helm for to gather wind, for he
    was greatly enchafed with the serpent: and the lion went
    alway about him fawning as a spaniel.  And then he
    stroked him on the neck and on the shoulders.  And then
    he thanked God of the fellowship of that beast.  And
    about noon the lion took his little whelp and trussed him
    and bare him there he came from.

    Then was Sir Percivale alone.  And as the tale telleth,
    he was one of the men of the world at that time which
    most believed in Our Lord Jesu Christ, for in those days
    there were but few folks that believed in God perfectly.
    For in those days the son spared not the father no more
    than a stranger.  And so Sir Percivale comforted himself
    in our Lord Jesu, and besought God no temptation should
    bring him out of God's service, but to endure as his true
    champion.  Thus when Sir Percivale had prayed he saw
    the lion come toward him, and then he couched down at
    his feet.  And so all that night the lion and he slept
    together; and when Sir Percivale slept he dreamed a
    marvellous dream, that there two ladies met with him,
    and that one sat upon a lion, and that other sat upon a
    serpent, and that one of them was young, and the other
    was old; and the youngest him thought said:  Sir Percivale,
    my lord saluteth thee, and sendeth thee word that
    thou array thee and make thee ready, for to-morn thou
    must fight with the strongest champion of the world.
    And if thou be overcome thou shall not be quit for losing
    of any of thy members, but thou shalt be shamed for ever
    to the world's end.  And then he asked her what was her
    lord.  And she said the greatest lord of all the world:
    and so she departed suddenly that he wist not where.
