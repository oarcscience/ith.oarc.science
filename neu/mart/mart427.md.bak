    CHAPTER XXI

    How Galahad anointed with the blood of the spear the
    Maimed King, and of other adventures.


    AND Galahad went anon to the spear which lay upon the
    table, and touched the blood with his fingers, and came
    after to the Maimed King and anointed his legs.  And
    therewith he clothed him anon, and start upon his feet out
    of his bed as an whole man, and thanked Our Lord that
    He had healed him.  And that was not to the worldward,
    for anon he yielded him to a place of religion of
    white monks, and was a full holy man.  That same night
    about midnight came a voice among them which said:
    My sons and not my chief sons, my friends and not my
    warriors, go ye hence where ye hope best to do and as I
    bade you.  Ah, thanked' be Thou, Lord, that Thou wilt
    vouchsafe to call us, Thy sinners.  Now may we well
    prove that we have not lost our pains.  And anon in
    all haste they took their harness and departed.  But the
    three knights of Gaul, one of them hight Claudine, King
    Claudas' son, and the other two were great gentlemen.
    Then prayed Galahad to everych of them, that if they
    come to King Arthur's court that they should salute my
    lord, Sir Launcelot, my father, and all the fellowship[1] of
    the Round Table; and prayed them if that they came on
    that part that they should not forget it.

    Right so departed Galahad, Percivale and Bors with
    him; and so they rode three days, and then they came to
    a rivage, and found the ship whereof the tale speaketh of


    [1] So W. de Worde; Caxton ``of them.''


    to-fore.  And when they came to the board they found in
    the midst the table of silver which they had left with the
    Maimed King, and the Sangreal which was covered with
    red samite.  Then were they glad to have such things in
    their fellowship; and so they entered and made great
    reverence thereto; and Galahad fell in his prayer long time
    to Our Lord, that at what time he asked, that he should
    pass out of this world.  So much he prayed till a voice
    said to him:  Galahad, thou shalt have thy request; and
    when thou askest the death of thy body thou shalt have it,
    and then shalt thou find the life of the soul.  Percivale
    heard this, and prayed him, of fellowship that was between
    them, to tell him wherefore he asked such things.  That
    shall I tell you, said Galahad; the other day when we saw
    a part of the adventures of the Sangreal I was in such a joy
    of heart, that I trow never man was that was earthly.  And
    therefore I wot well, when my body is dead my soul shall
    be in great joy to see the blessed Trinity every day, and
    the majesty of Our Lord, Jesu Christ.

    So long were they in the ship that they said to Galahad:
    Sir, in this bed ought ye to lie, for so saith the scripture.
    And so he laid him down and slept a great while; and
    when he awaked he looked afore him and saw the city of
    Sarras.  And as they would have landed they saw the ship
    wherein Percivale had put his sister in.  Truly, said
    Percivale, in the name of God, well hath my sister holden us
    covenant.  Then took they out of the ship the table of
    silver, and he took it to Percivale and to Bors, to go to-fore,
    and Galahad came behind.  And right so they went to the
    city, and at the gate of the city they saw an old man
    crooked.  Then Galahad called him and bade him help to
    bear this heavy thing.  Truly, said the old man, it is ten
    year ago that I might not go but with crutches.  Care thou
    not, said Galahad, and arise up and shew thy good will.
    And so he assayed, and found himself as whole as ever he
    was.  Than ran he to the table, and took one part against
    Galahad.  And anon arose there great noise in the city,
    that a cripple was made whole by knights marvellous that
    entered into the city.

    Then anon after, the three knights went to the water,
    and brought up into the palace Percivale's sister, and buried
    her as richly as a king's daughter ought to be.  And when
    the king of the city, which was cleped Estorause, saw the
    fellowship, he asked them of whence they were, and what
    thing it was that they had brought upon the table of silver.
    And they told him the truth of the Sangreal, and the power
    which that God had sent there.  Then the king was a
    tyrant, and was come of the line of paynims, and took them
    and put them in prison in a deep hole.
