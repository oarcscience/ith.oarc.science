### VARIATION ON 'BLUE BEARD'

In another version, by Estefanella Hirigaray, we have the more ordinary
tale of "Blue Beard"--that of a widower who has killed twenty wives, and
marries a twenty-first, who has two brothers. She drops the key in the
forbidden chamber, and is detected by the blood on it. She manages to
write to her brothers, and the dialogue by which she endeavours to gain
time is rather spirited. She is allowed to put oh her wedding-dress,
etc., to die in. She goes to get ready, and she hears the cries of her
husband, "Are you ready?" "I am putting on my dress." He bawls out
again, "Are you ready?" "Give me a moment more." "Are you ready?" "I am
fastening my dress." "Are you ready yet?" "I

am putting on my stockings." And she kept constantly looking out of
window to see if her brothers were coming. "Are you ready?" "Stop one
moment; I am putting on my shoes." "Are you ready?" "I am brushing my
hair." "Are you ready?" "Let me put on my wreath." And she sees her
brothers coming on horseback in the forest, but a very long way off. She
hears again, "Are you ready?" "I am coming in an instant." "You are
coming?" "I'll come, if you do not come down." "Don't come; I will come
down myself, without you." He seizes her on the stairs to kill her; but
the brothers rush in just in time to prevent her death, and they put him
in prison.

We heard, also, another version, which, unfortunately, we did not take
down. It had something about a horse in it, and was like "The Widow and
her Daughters," in Campbell, Vol. II., Tale xli., p. 265.
