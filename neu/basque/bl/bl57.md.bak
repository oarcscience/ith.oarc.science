### VARIATION ON 'THE SINGING TREE, THE BIRD WHICH TELLS THE TRUTH, AND THE WATER THAT MAKES YOUNG'

We have also the more common version of this story--of an aged king with
three sons. He reads of this water, and the three sons successively set
out to fetch it. The two first fail, and stop, drinking, &c., in a
certain city. The youngest meets an old woman, who tells him how to
charm all the beasts in a forest he has to pass through, and how

to get the water, but he is not to take anything else. But he steals the
bird, and the magic horse as well, and when he gets to the forest finds
all the animals awake. The old woman appears again, and gives him a
magic stick, with the aid of which he passes. He finds his brothers
against the advice of the old lady, and they throw him into a pit and
take away the water, the horse, and the bird; but the water has no
effect in their hands. The old woman appears, and sends a fox to help
him out of the pit. He comes home, the horse neighs, the bird sings, he
gives the water to his father, and from one hundred years old he becomes
twenty.
