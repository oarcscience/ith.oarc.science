### THE TARTARO.

ONCE upon a time there was the son of a king who for the punishment of
some fault became a monster. He could become a man again only by
marrying. One day he met a young girl who refused him, because she was
so frightened at him. And the Tartaro wanted to give her a ring, which
she would not accept. However, he sent it her by a young man. As soon as
the ring was upon her finger it began to say, "Thou there, and I
here." <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11) It kept always crying out
this, and the Tartaro pursued her continually; and, as the young girl
had such a horror of him, she cut off her finger and the ring, and threw
them into a large pond, and there the Tartaro drowned himself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_11"></span>[4:1](bl04.htm#fr_11) This talking giant's ring
appears in Campbell's "Popular Tales of the West Highlands," Vol. I., p.
111, in the tale called "Conall cra Bhuidhe." He also refers (p. 153) to
Grimm's tale of the "Robber and his Sons," where the same ring
appears:--"He puts on the gold ring which the giant gave him, which
forces him to cry out, 'Here I am!' He bites off his own finger, and so
escapes."
