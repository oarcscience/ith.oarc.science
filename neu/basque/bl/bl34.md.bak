### TABAKIERA, THE SNUFF-BOX. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md)

LIKE many others in the world, there was a lad who wished to travel, and
off he went. He finds a snuff-box, and opens it. And the snuff-box said
to him--

"Que quieres?" ("What do you wish for?")

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

He is frightened, and puts it at once into his pocket. Luckily he did
not throw it away. He goes on, and on, and on, and at last he said to
himself,

"(I wonder) if it would say to me again, 'Que quieres?' I should well
know what to answer."

He takes it out again, and opens it, and it says to him again,

"Que quieres?"

The lad says to it, "My hat full of gold."

And it is filled!

He is astounded, and he said to himself that he would never want
anything any more. He goes on, and on, and on; and, after he had passed
some forests, he arrives at a fine castle. The king lived there. He goes
round, and round, and round it, looking at it with an impudent air. The
king says to him--

"What are you looking for?"

"To see your castle."

"You would wish, too, to have one like it?"

The lad does not answer. When the evening came, our lad takes out his
snuff-box, and it said to him,

"Que quieres?"

"Build here, on this very spot, a castle, with laths of gold and silver,
and diamond tiles, and with all its furniture of gold and silver." <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)

As soon as he has said it, he sees in front of the king's castle a
castle like what he had asked for. When the king gets up in the morning,
he was astonished at this dazzling castle. His eyes were blinded by the
(reflection of the) rays of the sun which fell upon it. The king went
and said to him--

You must be a man of great power, <span id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md)
and you must come

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

to our house, where we will live together. I have a daughter, too, and
you shall marry her."

They do as the king had said, and they lived all together in the
dazzling house. He was married to the king's daughter, and lived
happily.

Now, the king's wife was very envious of the lad and of his wife. She
knew, by her daughter, how that they had a snuff-box, and that it did
all that they wished. She intrigued with one of the servants to try and
take it from them; but they take great care (to conceal) where they put
the snuff-box away every evening. Nevertheless, at last she sees where
it is put, and in the middle of the night, while they slept, she takes
it from them, and carries it to her old mistress. What a joy for her!

She opens it, and the snuff-box says to her, "Que quieres?"

"You must take myself and my husband, and my servants, and this
beautiful house, to the other side of the Red Sea, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) and leave my daughter and her husband
here."

When the young couple awoke in the morning, they found themselves in the
old castle, and their snuff-box was gone. They look for it everywhere,
but it is useless.

The young man will not wait an instant longer at home. He must start off
at once to find his castle and his snuff-box. He takes a horse, and as
much gold as the horse can carry, and he goes on, and on, and on, and
on. He searches through all the towns in the neighbourhood until he had
finished all his money. He searched, but he did not find it anywhere.
But he went looking out still, feeding his horse as best he could, and
begging for himself. Some one told him that he ought to go to the
moon--that he makes a very long journey, and that he might guide him. He
goes far, far, far away, on, and on, and on, and at last he arrives. He
finds an old woman, who says to him--

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

"What do you come to do here? My son devours all creatures of all sorts;
and, if you will trust me, You will be off before his arrival."

He tells her his misfortunes--how that he had a snuff-box of great
power, which has been stolen from him, and that he is now without
anything, far from his wife, and stripped of everything, "and perhaps
your son, in his journeys, has seen my palace, with its golden laths and
tiles of diamonds, and the other ornaments of gold and silver."

At that moment the moon appeared, and said to his mother that he smelt
some one. His mother told him how that there was a wretched man who had
lost everything; that he was come to him (for help), and that he would
guide him. The moon told him to show himself. He comes, and asks him if
he has not seen a house with beams of gold and with tiles of diamonds,
and the rest of gold and silver; and he tells him how it was taken away
from him.

He answers, "No;" that he has not seen it, but that the sun makes longer
journeys than he, and of greater extent, and that he would do better to
go to him.

He goes off again, on, and on, and on, with his horse, whom he nourished
as he could, and begging for himself. At length he arrives at the sun's
house. He finds an old woman, who said to him,

"Where do you come from? Be off from here! Do you not know that my son
eats all Christians?"

He said to her, "No! I will not go away. I am so wretched that I do not
care if he does eat me."

And he tells her how he has lost everything; that he had a house, which
had not its equal, with beams of gold and tiles of diamonds, and all the
ornaments of gold and precious stones; and that he had been going about
looking for it so long a time, and that there was no man so wretched as
he. This woman hides him. The sun comes out and says to his mother--

"I smell the smell of a Christian, and I must eat him."

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

The mother tells him that it was an unfortunate man who had lost his
all, that he had come to speak to him, and begs him to take pity on him.
He tells her to bring him out. Then the young man comes and asks the sun
if he has seen a palace which has its equal nowhere, with its laths of
gold and its tiles of diamonds, and the rest of gold and silver. The sun
says to him:

"No, but the south wind searches everything that I cannot see. He enters
into every corner, he does, and if any one ought to know he will know."

Our poor man then sets off again, feeding his horse how he could and
begging for himself, and he comes at length to the house of the south
wind. <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) He finds an old woman carrying
water, and who was filling a great many barrels. She said to him:

"What are you thinking of to come here? My son eats up everything when
he arrives hungry and furious. You must beware of him."

He says to her, "It is all the same to me. Let him eat me; I am so
wretched that I fear nothing."

And he tells her how he had a beautiful house which had not its equal in
all the world, and with it all sorts of riches, and that, "Having
abandoned my wife, I am seeking it, and I am come to consult your son,
being sent by the sun."

She hides him under the staircase. The south wind arrives as if he meant
to tear the house up, and very thirsty. Before beginning to drink he
smells the smell of the race of Christians, and said to his mother:

"Out with what you have hidden," and that he must begin by eating him.

His mother said to him, "Eat and drink what is before you."

And she tells him the misfortunes of this man, and how that the sun has
spared his life that he might come and consult him.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Then he makes the man come out, and the man tells him how that he is
going about trying to find a house) and that if anybody ought to know it
is he, and that they had robbed him of his house, which had laths of
gold, tiles of diamonds, and all the rest of gold and silver, and if he
has not seen it anywhere?

He tells him, "Yes, yes, and all to-day I have been passing over it, and
have not been able to take away one of its tiles."

"Oh! if you will tell me where it is!"

He says that it is on the other side of the Red Sea, very, very far
away.

When our man heard that, the length of the road did not frighten him--he
had already travelled over so much. He sets out then, and at last
arrives at that city. He asks if anyone is in want of a gardener. They
tell him that the gardener of the castle has gone away, and that perhaps
they will take him. He goes off, and recognises his house--judge with
what joy and delight! He asks if they are in want of a gardener. They
tell him "Yes," and our lad is very pleased. He passes some time
tolerably happily--middling. He talks with a servant about the riches of
the masters and of the power which they had. He flattered and cajoled
this young girl very much to get from her the history of the snuff-box,
and he told her once that he very much wished to see it. One evening she
brought it to him to look at, and our lad, very much pleased, pays great
attention to where it was hidden in the room of the mistress. At night,
when everybody is asleep, he goes and takes the snuff-box. You will
understand with what joy he opens it.

It says to him, "Que quieres?"

And the lad says to it, "Que quieres, Que quieres, <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) carry me with my castle to the same place
as (we were in) formerly, and drown the king and the queen and all the
servants in this Red Sea."

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

As soon as he had said it, he was carried to his wife, and they lived
happily, and the others all perished in the Red Sea. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[94:1](bl34.htm#fr_90.md) We were also told, in
Basque, "The Powerful Lantern," which was the story of Aladdin's lamp,
with only *one* incident omitted. The present is much more like the
Gaelic, but there (Campbell, Vol. II., 297-9) it is a lady who gives the
snuff-box, which says, "Eege gu djeege," on being opened. Campbell's
note is:--"The explanation of these sounds was, that it was 'as if they
were asking.' The sounds mean nothing, that I know of, in any language."
"Que quieres?" is pure Spanish--"What dost thou want?"

<span id="fn_91"></span>[95:1](bl34.htm#fr_91.md) *Cf.* MacCraw's variation
in Campbell, note, Vol. II., p. 301, for the rest of the story.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[95:2](bl34.htm#fr_92.md) "Power" in these tales,
in the Basque, seems always to mean "magic power," some wonder-working
gift or charm.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[96:1](bl34.htm#fr_93.md) In Campbell's versions it
is "the realm of the king under the waves," or "the realm of the rats;"
but a voyage has to be made to that, and a rat takes the place of the
servant in stealing the box again for the hero. "The Deccan Tales"
mention the Red Sea.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[98:1](bl34.htm#fr_94.md) The south wind is the
most dreaded local wind in the Pays Basque. It is always hot, and
sometimes very violent. After two or three days it usually brings on a
violent thunderstorm and rain.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[99:1](bl34.htm#fr_95.md) The lad here calls his
snuff-box affectionately "Que quieres," as if that were its name.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[100:1](bl34.htm#fr_96.md) The likeness and the
variation of this tale from Campbell's Gaelic one, "The Widow's Son,"
etc., Vol. II., pp. 293-303; prove that both must be independent
versions of some original like Aladdin's lamp, but not mere copies of
it.
