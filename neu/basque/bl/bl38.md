### VARIATION OF 'EZKABI-FIDEL'

We have another version almost identical with the above, except at the
commencement. Ezkabi really has the scab. On his journey, after leaving
his home, he pays the debts of a poor man whose corpse is being beaten
in front of the church, and buries him. There is nothing about a white
mare. An old woman is the good genius of the tale. He goes as gardener,
and the king's daughter falls in love with him, from catching a sight of
his golden hair from her window; for the rest the stories are identical,
except that this is a shorter form than the above.
