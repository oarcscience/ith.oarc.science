### II.

IF we except the Pastorales, the whole of Basque poetry may be described
as lyrical; either secular, as songs, or religious, as hymns and noëls.
There is no epic in Basque, <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_189.md) and
scarcely any narrative ballads; even those chiefly are of uncertain
date. A few sonnets exist, but they are almost exclusively translations
or imitations of French, Spanish, or classical poems, and cannot be
considered as genuine productions of the Basque muse. Some of the
religious poetry may be described as didactic, but this again is mostly
paraphrase or translation. All that is really native is lyrical. But
even in song the Basques show no remarkable poetical merit. The extreme
facility with which the language lends itself to rhyming desinence has a
most injurious effect upon versification. There are not verses only, but
whole poems, in which each line terminates with the same desinence.
Instead of striving after that perfection of form which the change of a
single word or even letter would affect injuriously, the Basques are too
often satisfied with this mere rhyme. Their compositions, too, if
published at all, are usually printed only on single sheets of paper,
easily dispersed and soon lost. Hence the preservation of Basque poetry
is entrusted mainly to the memory, and, thus it happens that one
scarcely meets with two copies of the same song exactly alike. If the
memory fails, the missing words and rhymes are so easily supplied by
others that it is not worth the

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

effort to recal the precise expression used. And so it comes to pass
that, while versification is very common among the Basques, high-class
poetry is extremely rare. They have no song writers to compare with
Burns or with Béranger. And if it be alleged that poets like these are,
rare, even among people far more numerous and more cultivated, the
Basques still fall short, when measured by a much lower standard. They
have no poets to rival the Gascon, Jasmin, or to compare with the
Provençal or the Catalan singers at the other end of the Pyrenean chain.
There is no modern Basque song which can be placed by the side of "Le
Demiselle" and others of the Biarritz poet, Justin Larrebat; and among
the older poets neither Dechepare nor Oyhenart is equal to the Béarnais,
Despourrins. While the Jacobite songs of Scotland are among the finest
productions of her lyric muse, the Carlist songs, on the contrary,
though telling of an equally brave and romantic struggle, are one and
all below mediocrity. But, while fully admitting this, there is yet much
that is pleasing in Basque poetry. If it has no great merits, it is
still free from any very gross defects. It is always true and manly, and
completely free from affectation. It is seldom forced, and the singer
sings just because it pleases him to do so, not to satisfy a craving
vanity or to strain after the name and fame of a poet. The moral tone is
almost always good. If at times, as in the drinking songs, and in some
few of the amatory, the expression is free and outspoken, vice is never
glossed over or covered with a false sentimentality. The Basque is never
mawkish or equivocal--with him right is right, and wrong is wrong, and
Basque poetry leaves no unpleasant after-taste behind. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_190.md)

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

The only peculiarity, in a poetical sense, is the extreme fondness for,
and frequent employment of, allegory. In the love songs the fair one is
constantly addressed under some allegorical disguise. It is a star the
lover admires, or it is the nightingale who bewails his sad lot. The
loved one is a flower, or a heifer, a dove or a quail, a pomegranate or
an apple, figures common to the poets of other countries; but the
Basques, even the rudest of them, never confuse these metaphors, as more
famous poets sometimes do--the allegory is ever consistently maintained
throughout. Even in prose they are accustomed to this use of allegory,
and catch up the slightest allusion to it; but to others it often
renders their poetry obscure, and very difficult of successful
translation. The stranger is in doubt whether a given poem is really
meant only for a description of the habits of the nightingale, or
whether the bird is a pseudonym for the poet or the poet's mistress.
Curiously enough, sometimes educated Basques seem to have almost as much
difficulty in seizing this allegory as have foreigners. Thus, in a work
now in course of publication, <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_191.md) one
of the most famous of these allegorical complaints is actually taken for
a poetical description of the nightingale itself.

The historical songs, like all other historical remains among the
Basques, are few and doubtful. There are two songs, however, for which
are claimed a greater historical importance and a higher antiquity than
any others can pretend to. These are the so-called "Leloaren Cantua" and
the "Altabiskarco Cantua." Both these are reputed by some writers to be
almost contemporaneous with the events which they relate. The first is
said to be founded on the wars of the Roman Emperor Augustus with the
Cantabri; the second is an account of the defeat of Charlemagne's
rear-guard

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

at Roncesvalles, A.D. 778. The former may be some three hundred years
old, but the latter is certainly a production of the nineteenth century,
though none the less it is the most spirited offspring of the Basque
muse. We will give the text and translation of each, and then justify
our conclusions.

The history of the above song is as follows: At the close of the
sixteenth century a notary of Zornoza, J. Iñiguez de Ibargüen, was
commissioned by the junta of Biscay to search the principal libraries of
Spain for documents relating to the Basques. In the archives of Simancas
he discovered an ancient MS. on parchment, containing verses in Basque,
some almost, others wholly obliterated. Of these he copied what he
could, and inserted them in p. 71 of his "Cronica general de España y
sumaria de Vizcaya," a work which still exists in manuscript in the town
of Marquina. From this history of Ibargüen the song was first reproduced
by the celebrated Wilhelm von Humboldt, and published by him in 1817 in
a supplement to Vater's "Mithridates." The text above given is taken
from that of the "Cancionero Vasco," Series 2, iii., pp. 18, 20, and
claims to be a new and literal copy from the MS. "Cronica" of Ibargüen.
From the date of its publication by Humboldt, this piece has been the
subject of much discussion. That it is one of the oldest fragments of
Basque poetry hardly admits of doubt. But, when asked to believe that it
is contemporary with Augustus, we must hesitate. The question arises:
Did Ibargüen copy the almost defaced original exactly as it was, or did
he suffer his declared predilections unconsciously to influence his
reading of it? <span id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_193.md)

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Many of the words
are still very obscure, and the translation of them is almost guess
work. The first verse has little or no apparent connection with the rest
of the poem, and has given rise to the most fanciful interpretations.
Lelo has been imagined by some to be the name of a Basque hero; Zara, or
Zarat, who kills him, the name of another; and the two reproduce the
story of Agamemnon and Ægisthus. Others, with more probability, take
Lelo, as is certainly the case in other poems, for a mere refrain (the
everlasting Lelo, as a Basque proverb has it) used by the singer merely
to give the key to the tune or rhythm to which he modulates the rest.
Chaho, with his usual audacity, would translate it "glory," and render
it thus:--

 

Finished is the glory! dead is the glory,  
                    Our glory!  
Old age has killed the glory,  
                    Our glory!

 

But it has been very plausibly suggested <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) that the verse bears a suspicious
likeness to a vague reminiscence of the Moslem cry "Lâ Êlah Ulâ Allah!"
&c.; and if so, this, in the north of Spain, would at one bound place
the poem some eight centuries at least after the time of Augustus. The
proper names have a too correct look. Octabiano, Roma, and Tiber are far
too much like the Latin; for if Greeks and Romans complained, as do
Strabo and Mela, of the difficulty of transcribing Basque or Iberian
names into their own language, the Basques might possibly find a
somewhat corresponding difficulty in transcribing Greek and Latin names
into Basque. Moreover, in a later verse appears "Uchin," a sobriquet for
"Augustino," as a baptismal name in use among the Spanish Basques to
this day. What the poem really refers to we dare not assert. We present
the "Leloaren Cantua" to our readers simply as one of the oldest
curiosities of Basque

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

verse, without pledging ourselves to any particular date or
interpretation thereof.

Fortunately, we shall be able to speak with much more decision of the
"Altabiskarco Cantua," of which the following is the latest text:--

ALTABISKARCO CANTUA.

SONG OF ALTABISCAR.

1\.

A CRY is heard  
From the Basque mountain's midst.  
Etcheco jauna, <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_195.md) at his door erect,
<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>  
Listens, and cries, "What want they? Who goes there?"  
At his lord's feet the dog that sleeping lay  
Starts up, his bark fills Altabiscar <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_196.md) round.

2\.

Through Ibañeta's <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_196.md) pass the noise
resounds,  
Striking the rocks on right and left it comes  
'Tis the dull murmur of a host from far,  
From off the mountain heights our men reply,  
Sounding aloud the signal of their horns  
Etcheco jauna whets his arrows then.

3\.

They come! They come! See, what a wood of spears  
What flags of myriad tints float in the midst!  
What lightning-flashes glance from off their arms!  
How many be they? Count them well, my child.  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,  
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

4\.

Twenty, and thousands more!  
'Twere but lost time to count.  
Our sinewy arms unite, tear up the rocks,  
Swift from the mountain tops we hurl them down  
Right on their heads,  
And crush, and slay them all.

5\.

What would they in our hills, these Northern men?  
Why come they here our quiet to disturb?  
God made the hills intending none should pass.  
Down tall the rolling rocks, the troops they crush!  
Streams the red blood! Quivers the mangled flesh!  
Oh! what a sea. of blood! What shattered bones!

6\.

Fly, to whom strength remaineth and a horse!  
Fly, Carloman, red cloak and raven plumes!  
Lies thy stout nephew, Roland, stark in death;  
For him his brilliant courage naught avails.  
And, now, ye Basques, leaving awhile these rocks,  
Down on the flying foe your arrows shower!

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

7\.

They run! They run! Where now that wood of spears ?  
Where the gay flags that flaunted in their midst?  
Rays from their bloodstained arms no longer flash!  
How many are they? Count them well, my child.  
20, 19, 18, 17, 15, 15, 14, 13,  
12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

8\.

One! There is left not one. 'Tis o'er!  
Etcheco Jauna home with thy dog retire.  
Embrace thy wife and child,  
Thine arrows clean, and stow them with thine horn;  
And then, lie down and sleep thereon.  
At night yon mangled flesh shall eagles <span
id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) eat,  
And to eternity those bones shall bleach.

The history of this song is very curious, and shows the little value of
subjective criticism in any but the most competent hands. The MS. of it
is alleged to have been found on the 5th of August, 1794, in a convent
at Fuenterrabia, by La Tour d'Auvergne, the celebrated "premier
grenadier" of the French Army. It was printed about the year 1835, by
Monglave, and accepted as a genuine contemporary document by Fauriel,
Chaho, Cenac-Moncaut, and many other French writers; by Lafuente, Amador
de los Rios, and other Spanish authors; by Araquistain, and by the
Editors of the "Revista Euskara" and of the "Cancionero Vasco" among the
Basques. It is needless to say that all guidebooks, tourist sketches,
*et hoc genus omne*, have adopted it. It was inserted as genuine by Fr.
Michel, in the *Gentleman's Magazine*, in 1858, and in more recent years
a translation appeared in another London magazine. In the "Basques et
Navarrais" of M. Louis Lande, lately published, it is alluded to as
genuine; and the *Saturday Review* of the 17th of August, 1878, quotes
it as a corroboration of the

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Chanson de
Roland." <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_198.md) There have been some,
however, who have stoutly opposed these claims; among them M. Barry, of
Toulouse, M. Gaston Paris, and M. J. F. Blade, which last writer, both
in a separate pamphlet and in his "Etudes sur l'Origine des Basques"
(Paris, 1859), has shown from internal grounds its want of authenticity.
M. Alexandre Dihinx, a Basque, in a series of articles in the
*Impartial*, of Bayonne, for 1873, which have since been reprinted by M.
J. Vinson, in *L'Avenir*, of Bayonne, May of the present year,
conclusively proved both the incorrectness and the modern character of
its Basque. But all these authors seem either to have been unaware of,
or to have unaccountably overlooked, the true history of the piece. When
M. Fr. Michel published this, and another song called "Abarcaren
Cantua," in the Gentleman's Magazine, in 1858, as specimens of *ancient*
Basque poetry, a letter from M. Antoine d'Abbadie, Membre de l'Institut,
appeared forthwith in the number for March, 1859, stating that the
Abarca song had actually been among the unsuccessful pieces submitted
for the prize in the poetical competition at Urrugne, of the previous
August; and he adds:--

"I am sorry that the *Altabiscarraco cantua*, mentioned in your same
number, is acknowledged as a gem of ancient popular poetry. Truth
compels me to deny that it is universally admitted as such, for one of
my Basque neighbours has often named the person who, about twenty four
years ago, composed it in French, and the other person, who translated
it into *modern* but indifferent Basque. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_199.md) The latter idiom,

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

on purely philological ground, stands peerless among the most ancient
languages in Europe, and I have felt it my duty to disclaim unfounded
pretensions of which it has no need.--I am, etc.,

"ANTOINE D'ABBADIR,  
*Correspond. de l'Institut de France*.

"*London*, *Jan*. 31, 1859."

In the next number M. Fr. Michel writes, "henceforth I will believe that
the songs called *Abarcaren Cantua*, and *Altabiscarraco Cantua* are
forgeries"; this testimony is decisive. It has often been repeated by M.
d'Abbadie, with the additional assurance that he knows not only the
house, but the very room in which the song was first composed. That the
language is modern and indifferent Basque is very evident in the text
given by M. Fr. Michel in "Le Pays Basque, Paris, 1857," That above,
taken from the "Cancionero Vasco" of the present year, is considerably
corrected and improved. All attempts, and many efforts have been made,
to force these irregular lines into any known form of Basque rhythm have
hitherto signally failed. For the amusement of some of our readers we
give below a list of the more evident foreign words in this and in the
"Leloaren Cantua." The relative antiquity will thus be seen at a
glance:--

*L*, Latin; *S*, Spanish; *F*, French; *G*, German words.

With reference to the above list we may observe that the Basque never
begins a word with r, but always prefixes a euphonic er, ar, ir; hence
er-respuesta, ar-roca, Er-rolan, er-rege, hir-risko, risque, F. In later
copies editors have altered "Romaco," in the "Song of Lelo," into
"Er-romaco," to give it more of a Basque look. Aren, or aen, eco-aco-co,
are case terminations; tcea-cea marks the verbal noun. Carlomann was
never the name of Charlemagne, but of his brother and his uncle.
Er-rolan is evidently from the French Roland; neither from the
Hruotlandus of Einhardus, nor from the Spanish Roldan. Defenders of the
authenticity of the piece allege that these words are only corruptions,
introduced in the course of ages; but our readers can judge for
themselves how far they enter into the very structure of the
composition.

The first book printed in Basque, the "Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ, per
Dominum Bernardum Echepare" (Bordeaux, 1345), is a collection of his
poems, religious and amatory, the latter predominating. Echepare was the
parish priest of the pretty little village of St. Michel, on the
Béhérobie Nive, above St. Jean Pied de Port; and, if Nature alone could
inspire, a poet, he ought at least to have rivalled those of our own
English Lakes. But, in truth, his verses are of scant poetical merit,
and of little interest save as a philological curiosity. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_201.md) They belong so distinctly to that
irritating mediocrity which never can be excused in a poet. After
Echepare the next author is Arnauld Oyhenart, of Mauléon, who published
a collection of his youthful Basque poems in Paris, 1657. These have, if
anything, less poetical value than Echepare's; but

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Oyhenart's
collection of proverbs and his "Notitia Utriusque Vasconiæ" will always
make his name stand high among Basque writers. Except hymns and noëls
(Christmas carols), of which many collections and editions have been
published from 1630 downwards, and some of which are noteworthy on
account of higher than mere poetical merit, the deep and evidently
genuine spirit of piety they evince, <span
id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_202.md) little else is preserved much older than
the present century. One ballad indeed there is, "The Betrothed of
Tardetz," which may be somewhat older. No two versions of it are exactly
alike, though the outline of the story is always the same. The Lord of
the Castle of Tardetz wishes to give the elder of his two daughters in
marriage to the King of Hungary, or of Portugal, as some have it. But
the lady's heart has been already won by Sala, the son of the miller of
Tardetz, and she bitterly bewails being "sold like a heifer." The bells
which, ring for her wedding will soon toll for her funeral. The romance
in its present form is evidently incomplete, but apparently ended with
the corpse of the bride being brought back to her father's castle.

Most of the Basque songs, except the drinking ones, are set, more or
less, in a minor key. The majority of the love songs would have been
described by our forefathers as "complaints." One of the prettiest, both
in words and music, is the fragment entitled "The Hermitage of St.
Joseph":--

The songs of the Agots, or Cagots, those Pariahs of the Pyrénées, who
dwelt apart shunned and despised by all, are, as might be expected,
uniformly sad. The misery of the labourer's lot, and even of that of the
*contrabandista*, is more

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

frequently dwelt upon than the compensations to the poverty of the one,
or the transient gleams of good fortune of the other. At least, such is
the case in all those which are really songs of the people. In these
there are not many delights of "life under the greenwood tree," as in
Robin Hood, or our factitious gipsies' songs. The forest is an object of
dread to the Basque poet, and it requires courage and all the powerful
attraction of a loved one to induce him to traverse by night its gloomy
shades; but then--

There are, too, verses of grim and bitter humour, which tell better than
the pen of the historian how wretched was formerly the lot of the
peasant, even in this favoured corner of France. Famine is personified,
and has a name given it, drawn in biting irony from that of the highest
Saint of the Church Calendar, Petiri Sanz (S. Peter). He wanders round
the country seeking where to settle permanently; at one place he is
driven off by (the sale of) rosin, at another

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

he is repulsed by (the sale of) a little wood, at another by a little
maize, at another by cheese and cherries; but at last he fixes his
[abode definitively](errata.htm#2) at St. Pée (another form of Peter.md),
on the Nivelle, where they have nothing at all to sell, and where he
torments the inhabitants by forcing them to keep many a fast beyond
those of ecclesiastical obligation. The same strain of gloomy humour
appears in another form in a poem entitled "Mes Méditations," <span
id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_206.md) in which a young priest of Ciboure,
slowly dying of consumption, traces in detail all the physical and
mental agonies of his approaching dissolution. A much less grim example,
however, is contained in the following, which we quote mainly because of
its brevity. It may remind some of our readers of a longer but similar
strain which used often to be sung at harvest-homes in the Midland
Counties:--

The lack of good poetry in Basque is certainly not due to want of
encouragement. Moreover, the wish to produce it is there, but the power
seems lacking. For over twenty years prizes have been annually given,
first at Urrugne, and then at Sare, by M. Antoine d'Abbadie, of Abbadia.
But among the multitude of competing poems few have been of any real
value, and both in merit and in the number presented they seem to
diminish annually. The best of them have been written by men of the
Professional class, whose taste has been formed on French, or Spanish,
or classical, rather than on native models. The following is considered
by native critics to be among the best, though several others are very
little, if at all, inferior <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_208.md):--

A pretty cradle song, "Lo! Lo! ene Maitea" ("Sleep! Sleep! my Darling"),
by M. Larralde, a physician of St. Jean de Luz, won the prize at Urrugne
in 1859. It is written to a tune composed by the Vicomte de Belzunce;
the words have been printed in the "Lettres Labourdines," par H. L.
Fabre (Bayonne, 1869).

The following belongs to a more quaint and popular class of lullaby, or
cradle songs; as it is so simple we do not give the Basque:--

LITTLE PETER. <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_210.md)

1\.

Ah, my little Peter,  
I am sleepy, and--  
Shall I go to bed?  
Go on spinning, and--  
Then, then, then,  
Go on spinning, and--  
Then, then, yes.

Dear little Peter,  
I have spun, and--

Put the thread up in skeins, and--  
Then, then, then,  
Put the thread up in skeins, and--  
Then, then, yes.

3\.

Dear little Peter,  
I have put it in skeins, and--  
Shall I go to bed?  
Wind off the thread, and--  
Then, then, then,  
Wind off the thread, and--  
Then, then, yes.

4\.

Dear little Peter,  
I have wound it off, and--  
Shall I go to bed?  
Bleach it, and--  
Then, then, then,  
Bleach it, and--  
Then, then, yes.

5\.

Dear little Peter,

Dear little Peter,

Shall I go to bed?  
Cut it, and--  
Then, then, then,  
Cut it, and--

Dear little Peter,

Oh! my little Peter,

The best living Basque poets are--on the French side, Captain
Elisamboure, of Hendaye; and Iparraguirre, of San Sebastian, among the
Spanish Basques. Iparraguirre is now very old, He is the author of the
song "Guernicaco Arbola." ("The Tree of Guernica," in Biscay), an oak
under which the Lords of Biscay swore fidelity to the Fueros. This has
become almost the national song of the Basques. <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_211.md) A few words on two other classes of
songs, the drinking and the *macaronic*, must conclude our remarks. The
most spirited drinking song is the following. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_212.md) It must be remembered, in excuse, that
the shepherds live a very hard life on the mountains the greater part of
the year, and taste little wine there.

It is not at all uncommon in a country where, within the space of some
twenty miles, the traveller may hear at least four languages--French,
Gascoun, Basque, and Spanish--to find two or more of these mixed in the
same poem, and sometimes with a little Latin as well. This occurs
frequently in the noëls, where the angel speaks in French or Latin, and
the shepherds reply in Gascoun or Basque; also sometimes in the love
songs, where the French or Spanish lover will try to soften the heart of
a Basque maiden by compliments in French or Spanish, while she

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

archly replies with coquettish refusals in Basque. The greatest tour de
force of this kind we know, both as to language and rhyme, is the song
given in Fr. Michel's "Le Pays Basque," p. 429. We quote the first verse
only; but the song continues with twenty-eight successive Basque rhymes
in "in," and the last seven in "en."

Almost every one of these Basque songs, like all true lyrics, has been
adapted to some tune, either older than the words, or composed specially
by the author. The music is often superior to the words. In the
*Nineteenth Century* for August, 1878, Grant-Duff speaks of some of the
Basque airs sung by the Béarnais tenor, Pascal Lamazou, as
"extraordinarily beautiful." <span id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_213.md)
Lamazou died at Pau in May, 1878. His *répertoire* consisted of fifty
Pyrenean songs, of which thirty-four are Béarnais, fourteen Basque, and
two

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

are from the "Pyrénées Orientales." <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_214.md) One of the Basque airs "Artzaina," has
somehow got attached to the popular American hymn, "I want to be an
angel." Another, and larger collection, including more correct
renderings of some of Lamazou's fourteen, is that of Sallaberry, "Chants
Populaires du Pays Basque" (Bayonne, 1870). But, long before this, a
collection of Basque Songs, Zorzicos, and dance music was published in
San Sebastian, by J. D. Iztueta, in 1824 and 1826. Excellent reviews of
these two works, with translations of some of the words, appeared in the
*Foreign Review and Continental Miscellany*, vol. ii., pp. 338, 1828;
and in vol. iv., p. 198. Some specimens of music are to be found at the
end of Michel's "Le Pays Basque," in the "Cancionero Vasco"--now in
course of publication, and so often referred to--and in other local
publications, besides those in private hands. Basquophiles love to
narrate that Rossini passed a summer in the Basque village of Cambo, and
believe that they can recognise the influence of Basque airs in some of
his subsequent operas. However this may be, let no one judge of Basque
music by the noëls usually howled in the streets at Christmas and the
New Year, or by the doleful productions of the last Carlist War. It
would be equally fair to judge of English music by the serenades of the
waits at Christmas. We refer those who wish to investigate further the
subject of this chapter to the excellent work, "Le Pays Basque," par M.
Fr. Michel (Paris and London, 1857), for the French, to the "Cancionero
Vasco," by Don José Manterola, now in course of publication at San
Sebastian, for the Spanish, Basque; and to M. Sallaberry's Chants
Populaires du Pays Basque" for the music.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_189"></span>[246:1](bl72.htm#fr_190.md) Ercilla, the author of
the "Araucana," was however of Basque blood, and Basque names occur
frequently among the poets and dramatists of Spain, especially in recent
years.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[248:1](bl72.htm#fr_191.md) The claim put forth in
the "Revista Euskara," p. 61, April, 1878, may be fully conceded:--"Si;
éste es el carácter distintivo de la poesía euskara; su exquisita
moralidad. Jamás se encuentra en ella nada que se parezca, ni á una
apologia del vicio, ni á una excusa del crimen."

<span id="fn_191"></span>[249:1](bl72.htm#fr_192.md) "Cancionero Vasco,
acompañado de traducciones castellanas, juicios criticos," etc., por
José Manterola. San Sebastian. 1877-8. Serie I., 2, p. 39.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[250:1](bl72.htm#fr_196.md) The reader will remark
that there is really no authority for treating these words as proper
names. This, however, is the universal interpretation among Basques.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[252:1](bl72.htm#fr_197.md) Ibargüen's words after
quoting the song are: "Por este órden referidas yba este cantar contando
toda esta historia que habemos dicho atrás en este capitulo de las
guerras ceviles que en cinco años Octaviano Cesar Augusto hizo en esta
Provincia Cantábrica, y aunque esta hereciat (historical song) tenga
otros muy muchos versos rodados tan solamente dellos he tornado los diez
e seis primeros, porque los demas estaban carcomidos, y los pongo aquí
para el qua fuere bascongado, contentándome con solo ellos ebitando
largueza importuna de los demás, que el pergamino está muy roñoso e
viejo," cited in the "Cancionero Vasco," 2, iii. pp. 4,5.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[253:1](bl72.htm#fr_198.md) *Cf.* Alexandre Dihinx
in the Impartial de Bayonne, in 1873. These articles have been reprinted
by M. J. Vinson in *L'Avenir* de Bayonne, May, 1878.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[255:1](bl72.htm#fr_199.md) The master of the
house," the usual respectful address to a Basque proprietor of any rank.
His wife is "Etcheco Anderea," "The mistress of the house."

<span id="fn_196"></span>[256:1](bl72.htm#fr_201.md) Altabiscar is the
mountain on the East, Ibañeta that on the West of the supposed scene of
conflict.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[257:1](bl72.htm#fr_202.md) Of course it ought to
be "vultures." The Basque is distinctly "eagles;" an error which no
Basque shepherd could have made.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[258:1](bl72.htm#fr_203.md) The use of rocks "is
confirmed by the Basque ballad of Altabiscar, in which, however, there
is no allusion to the powerful inducement of booty."

<span id="fn_199"></span>[258:2](bl72.htm#fr_204.md) There are other
examples of similar mystification in later Basque literature. "Les Échos
du Pas de Roland," par J. B. Dasconaguerre, Bayonne, 1868, professes on
the title to be "traduit du Basque"; but the "Atheko-gaitzeko
Oiharzunak" (the echoes of the bad door or pass), Bayonan, 1870, is
really a translation from the *French*. To the Basques the name of
Roland is unknown in connection with this beautiful ravine. M. Fr.
Michel's "Le Romancero du Pays Basque," Didot, Paris, 1859, is scarcely
less an embroidery on themes of which the ground only is Basque.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[259:1](bl72.htm#fr_205.md) *Cf.* *lorea*, from
the Latin *flos flore*.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[260:1](bl72.htm#fr_206.md) An exact reprint of
Echepare's "Poems," edited by M. Vinson, was published by Cazals,
Bayonne, 1874.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[261:1](bl72.htm#fr_207.md) The most curious fact
to notice in these hymns is, how very soon after their death the Jesuit
Fathers, Ignatius de Loyola and François de Xavier, were celebrated and
addressed as saints in Basque verse.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[262:1](bl72.htm#fr_208.md) This song is prettily
translated in Miss Costello's "Béarn and the Pyrénées," London, 1844,
where are also translations of some other Basque songs, the originals of
which I have failed to trace.

1\.

Borne on thy wings amidst the air,  
  Sweet bird, where wilt thou go?  
For if thou wouldst to Spain repair,  
  The ports are filled with snow.  
Wait, and we will fly together,  
  When the Spring brings sunny weather.

2\.

St. Joseph's Hermitage is lone,  
  Amidst the desert bare,  
And when we on our way are gone,  
  Awhile we'll rest us there;  
As we pursue our mountain track,  
  Shall we not sigh as we look back?

3\.

Go to my love, oh! gentle sigh,  
  And near her chamber hover nigh;  
Glide to her heart, make that thy shrine,  
  As she is fondly kept in mine.  
Then thou may'st tell her it is I  
  Who sent thee to her, gentle sigh!

<span id="fn_204"></span>[263:1](bl72.htm#fr_209.md) For the most recent
theory on the Cagots, see "Les Parias de France et de l'Espagne," par M.
de Rochas (Hachette, Paris, 1876).

<span id="fn_205"></span>[265:1](bl72.htm#fr_210.md) More often the Cagots'
ears were said to be either completely round or with very long lobes, or
with the lobes adhering. We have found examples of all of these in the
Basque country, but not confined or peculiar to the Cagots. A case like
that described in the verse above we have never seen.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[266:1](bl72.htm#fr_211.md) Michel, "Le Pays
Basque," p. 352.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[266:2](bl72.htm#fr_212.md) Michel, "Le Pays
Basque," p. 44.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[267:1](bl72.htm#fr_213.md) I owe the MS. of this
song to the kindness of M. Achille Fouquier, author, sportsman, and
artist.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[268:1](bl72.htm#fr_214.md) A line has dropped out
of the MS. here. We supply the probable meaning. The composer is one P.
Mendibel, 1859.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[271:1](bl72.htm#fr_215.md) Taken down by M. J.
Vinson, February 21, 1874. *Cf.* "Proverbes du Pays de Béarn," par V.
Lespy (Montpellier, 1876), p. 84, for another song on "Little Peter" in
Gascoun.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[272:1](bl72.htm#fr_216.md) *Cf.* Fr. Michel, "Le
Paya Basque," p. 160. "Cancionero Vasco," Series 2, iii., 82, etc.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[272:2](bl72.htm#fr_217.md) From the MS. of M. A.
Fouquier. This song took the prize at Urrugne, 1858.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[275:1](bl72.htm#fr_218.md) The latest traveller
in the Basque countries corroborates this. Major Campion writes, "I had
no idea how fine were the old Basque songs, or, more correctly speaking,
chants; some of them being perfectly charming."--"On Foot in Spain," by
J. S. Campion, p. 73 (Chapman and Hall, 1879.)

obtained chez Ribaut, Pau, and the other booksellers at Biarritz and
Pau.
