### VARIATION OF 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'

We have another version of this tale, which is a little more like its
prototype, the "Cupid and Psyche" of Apuleius. In this the monster comes
only at night. At first she is horribly frightened at it, but little by
little she becomes accustomed to it, and loves it. At last, after having
been left alone for some days, a magnificent young man appears to her, a
king's son, who had been bewitched into the monster until some one
should love him. Of course they marry and are happy.

ESTEFANELLA HIRIGARAY.

In a third version, which was not taken down, the father was a sailor
instead of a king.
