blinds him with the red-hot spit, and escapes by letting himself down
through a garret window, The Tartaro pursues, guided by his ring, which
at last he throws to the young man to put on, when it cries out as
above, and the young man cuts off his finger, and throws it down a
precipice or into a bog, where the ring still cries out, and the Tartaro
following, is dashed to pieces and drowned.
