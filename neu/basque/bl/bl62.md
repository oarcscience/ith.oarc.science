# VII.--RELIGIOUS TALES.

WE give these tales simply as specimens of a literature which in
mediæval times rivalled in popularity and interest all other kinds of
literature put together. That even yet it is not without attraction, and
that to minds which in some aspects seem most opposed to its influence,
the preface of the late Charles Kingsley to "The Hermits" conclusively
shows. Such tales have, too, a deeper interest to all who study the
manner in which at a certain stage of intellectual cultivation the human
mind seems alone able to take hold upon religious truth; or, at least,
the side on which it is then most susceptible to its impressions. It is
easy enough to laugh at these legends, and to throw them aside in
contempt, as alternately irreverent or superstitious; but their very
existence has an historical value which no ecclesiastical historian
should neglect. Their grossness and rudeness to a great extent hide from
us their real tenderness and true religious feeling; but they were,
doubtless, to those who first heard them, and are still to those who now
recite them, fully as instructive, and have quite as beneficial,
purifying, and ennobling influence on them as the most polished and
refined of the religious tales of the present day have on the young of
our own generation.
