# GLOSSARY

A tile, a tree, and a coat of mail. By the *fueros* of Biscay the eldest
son inherited all the property, leaving to the other brothers only the
mail as a knight: a tree, to signify, no doubt, the deeply-rooted family
stock of nobility, and a tile, as representing the family house. P.
[249](lbp16.htm#page_249.md).

Achular. A mountain of Guipuzcoa, close to Andoain. There is another of
the same name in the valley of Lerin, in Navarre. P.
[206](lbp11.htm#page_206.md).

Aitz-belz. *The black cliff*. By this name is known a mountain of
Mendaro, in which there is a chasm so deep that the people believe that
it ends in the bottomless pit of hell. P. [250](lbp16.htm#page_250.md).

Aitzgorri. Mountain of Guipuzcoa: a continuation of Aloña. It rises
1·800 metres above the level of the sea. P. [228](lbp14.htm#page_228.md).

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

Aloña. A mountain of Guipuzcoa, at whose southerly base is situated the
magnificent town of Oñate, where, for a long time during the seven
years' civil war, the Infante Don Carlos de Bourbon, uncle of Isabella
II., held his court. P. [233](lbp15.htm#page_233.md).

Amboto. A very high cliff situated on the frontiers of Guipuzcoa, Alava,
and Biscay. P. [228](lbp14.htm#page_228.md).

Aquelarre. A word composed of *larre*, pasture land, and *Aquerra*, buck
goat; hence the word *Aquelarre* signifies the *pasture land of the
goat*. It is well known that this animal figures in all the conventicles
of witches as representing the Evil One. P. [19](lbp04.htm#page_19.md).

Aránzan, zu. Literally, "You, in a thorn?" P. [234](lbp15.htm#page_234.md).

Aránzanzu, Convent of. Situated on the south-west of the Monte Aloña.
The convent was under the invocation of Our Lady of Aránzanzu, and was
inhabited by the friars of the Order of St. Francis. The situation of
this convent was very remarkable. It was cast, so to say, on the highest
point and most rugged and bare of the mountain, on the height of a steep
declivity, and from this may be inferred the daring and solidity of that
capricious construction, Throughout the three Basque provinces the holy
image of Our Lady of Aránzanzu was very famous, and the devotion of the
people for it, even in our days, very general. During the month of May
it is visited by numerous pilgrimages, and nothing more fantastic can be
imagined than the effect produced by the glare of the fires at night,
which are lit by the multitudes encamped on the mountain, as they are
unable to

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

find accommodation for all in the spacious inns close to the convent,
and to listen to the echoes of the magnificent organ, instrumental
orchestra, and large choir of voices, as they celebrate the praises of
the Virgin and intoned the prayers. The convent was only visible at a
distance of about fifty metres. I am sorry to add that this singular
construction was set fire to by order of General Rodil, during the civil
war against Don Carlos--a deed of barbarism which will always merit
reprehension and condemnation. P. [234](lbp15.htm#page_234.md).

Arguiduna. Fatuous fire, or Will-o'-the-Wisp. P.
[52](lbp05.htm#page_52.md).

Articuza. Palace and stronghold close to the shores of that name. They
are situated in the centre of the mountains of Goizueta, ten kilometres
from the town, and surrounded by dense woods and forests. P.
[123](lbp06.htm#page_123.md).

Asté, *Sem*, *Nestos*, and *Heas*. Mountainous and deserted places in
the centre of the Pyrenees. P. [223](lbp13.htm#page_223.md).

Astiya. A Basque word which is equal to "Witch," or one professing to
possess the art of divination, or of casting spells or charms over
people. P. [248](lbp16.htm#page_248.md).

Bardena Real. A deserted and plain cut through by rocks and broken
boulders, extending from the junction of the rivers Ebro and Aragon to
within two kilometres beyond the frontier of the ancient kingdom of
Aragon, a distance comprehending many kilometres. P.
[107](lbp06.htm#page_107.md).

Basso-jaun. Literally translated it signifies the *Lord of the Woods*.
The superstitious imagination of the Basques depicts him as a horrible
monster in human form, covered with hair, and having nails long and hard
as those

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

of a wild boar. It is supposed to reside in the deepest part of the
woods, and occasionally it appears at the mouths of caverns and in
mountain torrents. Very curious are the details which are given
concerning this popular belief, by M. Michel, in his work entitled "Le
Pais Basque," p. 154. P. [3](lbp03.htm#page_3.md), and [p.
17](lbp03.htm#page_17.md) of Introduction.

Begoña. The church of Begoña stands in the neighbourhood of Bilbao, on
the eminence of Artagan, which overlooks the town.. It is one of the
most renowned temples of these provinces. The present temple was
constructed at the commencement of the sixteenth century, but from time
immemorial the Virgin Mary has been venerated there under the invocation
of Santa Maria de Begoña. Tradition tells us that its miraculous image
appeared on that spot, and, on endeavouring to erect a church on the
summit of the mountain, they went in procession to conduct the image to
the place where they intended to build the edifice, but they heard a
mysterious voice which said, *Bego-oña* ("Keep still"), and from this
voice was the name given of Begoña. P. [170](lbp09.htm#page_170.md).

Benzozia. The Venus of chaste love of the primitive Basques. P.
[208](lbp11.htm#page_208.md).

Berderiz. A mountain situated at two kilometres from the town of

very high mountains. P. [221](lbp13.htm#page_221.md).

Cadagüa. This is the most powerful river of Biscay, after that of
Ibaizabal. It has its origin in the highest part of the

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

vale of Mena, which anciently belonged to Biscay, and at the present day
to Burgos. It flows along the Encartaciones of Biscay, and joins the
Ibaizabal about a league below Bilbao. P. [166](lbp09.htm#page_166.md).

Cahella, *Belaya*, *Ahaide*. High and very luxuriant mountains, close to
the valley of Roncal, in Navarre. P. [225](lbp13.htm#page_225.md).

Canigou. A high and inaccessible mountain of the French Pyrenees; part
corresponds to Spain. P. [208](lbp11.htm#page_208.md).

Cannas. A celebrated battle gained by Hannibal against the Romans. A
vanguard of the Carthaginian army which decided the victory was composed
of Basque auxiliaries. P. [230](lbp14.htm#page_230.md).

Cantabrians. A people of Hispana Tarraconeza, between the Pyrenees and
the Ocean, inhabiting Navarre, Biscay, Alava, and Guipuzcoa. P.
[154](lbp08.htm#page_154.md).

Capusay. A sort of dalmatic of very thick cloth furnished with a hood.
P. [24](lbp04.htm#page_24.md).

Clemencia Isaura. A lady of rank descended from the nobles of Tolosa.
She lived in the fifteenth century. It was she who revived in that city
the famous floral games, which had fallen into disuse for more than a
century, and she left at her death, in 1513, a considerable sum for
defraying the expenses of these poetic tournaments. P.
[210](lbp11.htm#page_210.md).

Covadonga, *Navas*, and *Salado*. Three famous sanguinary battles, in
which the Moors were routed: in these the Basque legions took an active
part. P. [230](lbp14.htm#page_230.md).

Dalmatic. A very rich robe embroidered with gold spangles, worn over
tunics of white wool on great festivals by the ancient Euscaros in olden
times. This dalmatic was used

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

as a sign of authority. The shape of this robe is exactly as the
vestments worn during High Mass by the officiating deacon and
sub-deacon, with the sole difference that the dalmatic has a hood. The
"capusay" of the shepherds and country people of our time, worn in the
Basque country, is an exact copy of that very ancient robe. P.
[237](lbp15.htm#page_237.md).

Durango. Principal town of Biscay. P. [229](lbp14.htm#page_229.md).

Echeco-jauna. The head of the family, proprietor, &c. Pp.
[127](lbp07.htm#page_127) and [155](lbp08.htm#page_155.md).

Embrun. A cistern or reservoir in Palestine, much renowned in the time
of the Crusaders. P. [211](lbp11.htm#page_211.md).

Eskaldunac. Some authors write it *Escualdunac* (from *escua*, hand,
*alde*, right, *dunac*, those who have), a name which the Biscayans, or
Basque people, give to themselves. In their dialect they call themselves
Euskarians. This dialect, the wise Humboldt considered, was the most
remarkable language of all he was acquainted with. P.
[156](lbp08.htm#page_156.md).

Esquiroz. A mountain situated in Navarre, on the confines of Bardena
Real. P. [206](lbp11.htm#page_206.md).

Legends," by the Rev. Wentworth Webster. P. [229](lbp14.htm#page_229.md).

Five Towns of Aragon. A group composed of the towns of *Sos*, Sada*v*a,
*Uncastillo*, *Tauste*, and *Egea*--all situated on the frontiers of
Aragon and Navarre, to the extreme of the . Pyrenees. P.
[206](lbp11.htm#page_206.md).

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

Gara-paita. *The collecting of the brake fern*. This is a rustic
agricultural work in which all the neighbours and relatives join the
landowner. It generally lasts several days, and each evening, when the
day's labour is over, the young people amuse themselves with music,
dancing, and love-making; while the old people spend the time in games,
or recounting tales or ballads. In this way they convert what would
otherwise be a laborious work into a regular country feast. P.
[248](lbp16.htm#page_248.md).

Gorbea. A mountain of Alava, which overlooks the plain upon which stands
the city of Vitoria. P. [228](lbp14.htm#page_228.md).

Guernica, *Arriaga*, and *Guerekiz*. The three camps where in ancient
times were gathered together the *bill-zaars*, or meetings of the
ancients. The first was in Alava, the second in Biscay, and the third in
Guipuzcoa. P. [228](lbp14.htm#page_228.md).

Guernicáco Arbola. The Tree of Guernica. This is one of the patriotic
songs dedicated to the tree of Basque liberties, which is close to the
town of Guernica, in Biscay. The actual tree is nearly a century old,
since it was only thirty years old when its predecessor fell down from
old age in 1811, and that one numbered more than three hundred years
when it fell. Its trunk, says Iturriza, at the end of last century, was
fifteen feet in circumference. The origin of this symbolical tree of the
Basque liberties dates back to the origin of the Biscayan society. The
statute tree is perpetuated like the Euskarian family, and is succeeded
by its scions. The general *juntas* are materially inaugurated under the
tree, and are continued in the juridical church of Santa Maria la
Antigua,

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

placed also materially under the shadow of the statute oak. The actual
tree is robust and beautiful, notwithstanding that it was greatly
injured in 1830 or 1850 by the erection of the building intended for the
general archive of the province. The tree which is to substitute the
present one was planted a few years ago. Poetry and oratory have many
times enthusiastically saluted the Tree of Guernica. The philosopher of
Geneva sent it his blessing. Tallien saluted it in the midst of the
French Convention, and many Spanish poets have written charming odes to
the tree. The lords of Biscay took their oaths seated on a stone bench
placed at the foot of the tree. It was on that spot that the Catholic
Kings Ferdinand and Isabella sat, as also other monarchs. There is a
patriotic song dedicated to the tree, and runs as follows

El Arbol de Guernica  
es bendecido  
Y entre los vascongados  
  Amado de todos.  
Propaga y estiende  
tu fruto por el mundo  
Nosotros te adoramos  
  Arbol Santo!

Ha cerca de mil años.  
Segun se dice  
que Dios plantó,  
  El Arbol de Guernica.  
Permanece erguido  
porque si ahora  
caes,  
  Somos completamente perdidos.<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

No caerás  
Arbol amado  
Si procede bien  
  el Congreso de Vizcaya.  
Las cuatro tomaremos  
parte en tu sosten  
para que viva en paz  
  el pueblo vascongado.

Viva eternamente,  
Y para pedirselo al Señor  
Prosternémonos todos  
  Al punto de rodillas:  
Y cuando de todo corazon  
hayamos orado  
El Arbol viverá  
  en lo presente y lo porvenir. P. [158](lbp08.htm#page_158.md).

liberties. P. [158](lbp08.htm#page_158.md).

Hurca-Mendi. A Basque word composed of *hurca*, gibbet, and *mendia*,
mountain. This is the name of the place in which occurred the event
referred to in the tale. In past times it was called
*Hurca-mendi-mendia*, that is to say, the mountain of the gibbet, but at
the present day the last word is suppressed, and is only known as in the
title of the tradition. P. [247](lbp16.htm#page_247.md).

Ibaizabal. A word equivalent to "Wide River." It is the name given by
the Basques to the river Nervion, which proceeds from the mountains
Durango and Orduña, and,

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

passing Bilbao, empties itself into the sea at Portugalete, or, rather,
between Santurce and Algorta, which stand to the right and left of the
bar. P. [181](lbp09.htm#page_181.md).

Irati. One of the principal mountains of Navarre. It is covered by dense
woods, in which are found lynx, bears, wolves, and all kinds of large
game. The circumference of the base of this mountain measures about
fifty kilometres. One part corresponds to France, and the rest to
Navarre. P. [221](lbp13.htm#page_221.md).

the Port of Passagens to that of Fuenterrabia. At its extreme north
there stood anciently the promontory of Olearso, in our days the Cape of
Higuer. P. [208](lbp11.htm#page_208.md).

Jauregui (*Gaspar*). Field-marshal in the service of the Queen D.

chief. P. [246](lbp15.htm#page_246.md).

Kuruceta. A mountain situated in Guipuzcoa and Navarre, upon which some
hundreds of Basque prisoners were crucified during the wars against the

Kurucificatuaren Canta. (*The Chant of the Crucified*.) During the long
and sanguinary war sustained by the Romans against the inhabitants of
the Basque mountains, the prisoners who fell into the power of the
Romans were

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

crucified on the summit of the mountains, with the object of inspiring
the dwellers with terror. The heroic Basques intoned, while on the
cross, a chant of triumph and death, and also insulted their enemies,
who witnessed with feelings of awe such manifestations of courage and
lofty independence of spirit. P. [215](lbp12.htm#page_215.md).

Lamia. The Basque water-nymph, or mermaid. P. [185](lbp10.htm#page_185.md).

Lara. A young bard and Basque chief of the period when the wars were

his right hand. P. [233](lbp15.htm#page_233.md).

Lecayo. A cry of joy which is used as a signal. P.
[60](lbp05.htm#page_60.md).

Left hand of a child, The. It was a general belief among the mountain
dwellers of the Basque provinces that the left hand of a child, if
severed during sleep, and wrapped round with curls of its own hair,
became a valuable amulet, which would deliver them of every kind of
danger, and with it philters of different properties could also be made.
There yet exists some among the rude inhabitants of the mountains of
Roncal who foster this superstitious belief, although examples are
unknown of this cruel mutilation ever having been effected, unless by
the artifice of *gipsies*, *agotes*, or Jews in very remote ages, as
there still exists evidence of severe provisions having been adopted
against these barbarians. It was also a popular belief that the blood of
children was useful for invigorating the weak bodies of women. P.
[88](lbp06.htm#page_88.md).

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

Maitagarri. Among the Basque people this is a fairy, or hade, which
inhabits the lakes, and corresponds to the "Peri," or the Genius of the
Persians. According to the legend, or popular tradition, this fairy, or
hade, fell in love with a shepherd called Luzaide, and she took him to
the summit of Ahuñemendi, where she had her palace made of crystal. This
legend evidently forms the basis of the narrative which the author gives
in this chapter. P. [80](lbp06.htm#page_80.md) and
[105](lbp06.htm#page_105.md).

Millares. By this name was anciently designated the amount of real
property levied by the *fueros* as a tax, but later on this term
comprehended all wealth derived from inheritance, dowries, or other
bequests. Pp. [251](lbp16.htm#page_251.md).

Novempopulania. During the epoch of the domination of the Romans, this
district extended from the Cantabrian Ocean to the margin of the river
Garrona, and from the first slope of the French Pyrenees to the margin
of the above-said river and its mouth into the sea, forming an acute
angle. P. [223](lbp13.htm#page_223.md).

Odolaga. A mountain which, forming a cordillera, separates the valleys
of Baztan and Ulzama. It is covered with woods. P.
[216](lbp12.htm#page_216.md).

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

Otsondo. A mountain on the frontiers of France, near the Urdax, in
Navarre. P. [216](lbp12.htm#page_216.md).

Padura. A parochial district of Biscay. It was here that the natives
completely routed the army of Ordoño the Wicked. At the present day this
spot is known under the name of *Arrigorriaga* (Red stones), an
appellation given to it, as tradition informs us, on account of the
great quantity of blood which was spilt on the stones and imparted a red
colour to them. P. [156](lbp08.htm#page_156.md).

Quidaria. Chieftain. P. [159](lbp08.htm#page_159.md).

Regil. The ancient Errazill. A town close to Tolosa, of Guipuzcoa. Its

[230](lbp14.htm#page_230.md).

Sumbilla. A lovely, picturesque town of Navarre, situated in the valley
of Lerin, on the straight line with Vidassoa, about thirty-five
kilometres from Pamplona. P. [207](lbp11.htm#page_207.md)

Tejo. A very common tree of the Basque mountains, the sap of which is
poisonous. The Cantabrians used to poison themselves with this sap
rather than surrender to the enemy. From this word Tejo was derived the
name of *Toxicum*, or *tosigo*, which, later on, was applied to all
descriptions of poison. Thousands of persons, principally among the aged
men and women, took this poison, according to Roman historians, in
Medulia and in the Hirnio, to save themselves from slavery and chains.
P. [247](lbp16.htm#page_247.md).

Tolosa. The capital of the province of Guipuzcoa. P.
[212](lbp11.htm#page_212.md).
