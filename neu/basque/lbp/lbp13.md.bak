ING, bard, sing! you who are as old as the world, and whose head began
to whiten on the very day when the great beech of Berderiz <span
id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) was planted. Sing, bard, sing! Eldest of
our improvisatores; singer of our feasts, of our warlike deeds, of our
loves! Sing a welcome to our

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

brothers of the valley of Bertizarana, of Baztan, Of Aezcoa, of Erro,
and of Roncal. <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) Salute with your most
penetrative and sonorous "lecayo" our brothers of Elzupel, of Otsobide,
Hernio, and Aitzgorri. <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md)

The night is dark, and the wind whistles across the trees of
Irati, <span id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md) compelling the wolf of the
mountains to hide its brown head. The night is darksome, and a whirlwind
of snow is drifting the flakes in heaps. It is a pleasant night for us,
children of the mountains and of the tempests. It is a night which
terrifies the Roman matrons, and makes the sybarite son of the Tiber
shudder as he ties on his soft couch.

We shall enter with strung bow into the gardens full of statues, into
the palaces of marble, into the bedchambers hung with silken draperies.
We must feast at the ivory tables, we must fill ourselves with the wines
of Syracuse and of Cyprus, quaffed in cups of gold and precious stones.
Our women will work mantles of

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

purple--standards to serve as guides in the battles--and will plait
their hair with threads woven with the silver of their cups. The
chieftain of the frontiers on hearing the "irrinzi" will mistake it for
the noise of the hurricane, and we shall traverse the plains swift as
the winds. The Romans crucified our prisoners, and we must devastate
their cities and tread down their fields. And by the light of the
conflagrations our sons, crowning the crests of the mountains, will
intone hymns of victory.

Sing, bard, sing! This is the hour of our raid: the owl screeches in the
crevices, the wolf hides in the caverns, the eagle, timorous, thrusts
its beak under the wing; because night is fearful to all creatures, save
to us, sons of the mountains and of the tempest. Come, brothers,
forward! We drink our last wine, and eat our last bread, and our
children ask for more! Reach the cup of sour milk, and let us drink our
parting cup. Forward, my sons! Let our women sleep, and hush our
mastiffs. The raid will last eight suns.

 

Thus spoke the chieftain of Izalzu, <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)
and great acclamations resounded among the rocks of Orbara, <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) and the

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

torrent, which later on took the name of Irati, stayed its rapid course.

An hour later, and the mountaineers traversed the deserted parts of
Montlig and Astarac. <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) To the right
appear, like so many skeletons of gigantic elephants amid the shades of
night, the Druidical altars of Asté, Sem, Nestos, and Heas. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md) From thence they descend and sally out of
the darksome defiles of Zulogaraya, Izotzce, and Asarosta, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) into the fertile plains of
Novempopulania. <span id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_44.md) They descend
silently and sinister, like the black, immense wave, the first breath of
the hurricane which at night surprises the heedless ship.

Novempopulania slumbers in the midst of gardens and flowers, its
splendid palaces built of the marble of Paros and of gold from Ethiopia,
and out of them exhales, from among their peristyle columns, the
perfumes of the feasts of night. And they descend, those sons of the
mountains, like bands of water birds, enveloped in the

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

dismal mantle of the tempest. The watch-guards of the Roman fortresses
are showing their bare heads and, flinging aside their lances, sleep at
will; because the mountain is far distant--because no noise comes from
thence--because the storm increases, and the night continues fearful and
darksome. The waters of the Adour and of the Nive <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) are filled with the multitude that are
swimming across silently, The neigh of the war-horse is not heard; nor
is the red standard of the *Three Hands* waving in the air; nor is the
echo awakened by the "irrinzi" of war.

Virgins of Leheren, of Iscilo, and Arai, repose peacefully. Only can
your sleep be agitated by the great voice of the tempest, or by the last
chords which vibrate from the citherns of gold. Nevertheless, during
your waking hours you will smile at the image of the patrician who
subjugated the heart, wearing on his brow the diadem of triumph in the
Hypic games! And you will do well; because the mountain is distant, and
no noise comes from thence; because the storm increases, and the night
is fearful and darksome.

Towards the furthest compass of the horizon is seen a red point; another
here and there, and some nearer. Oh, how these luminous points increase!
How do the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

waters of the rivers seethe! What clamours are mingled in the roar of
the tempest! What shadows are those which glide along the vast plains?
What smoke is that which rises like a funereal pall, and interposes
between earth and the firmament?

Sing, bards, sing! Sing the incursions of the sons of the mountains and
of the tempest! The lances are dripping with blood; the men come loaded
with spoils. Sing, bard, sing! May your sonorous voice be echoed across
the woods and forests of Cahella, of Belaya, and of Ahaide, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) singing the victory of the sons of Aitor.
Sing, bard of the silvery beard! Our children will have white bread and
red wine until they are satiated, and our chieftains crucified in
Kuruceta and Izascun smile from within their sepulchres.

The son of the Tiber remains there below, amid the ruins of the
burnt-out palaces. Next spring the lime-tree of pale yellow flowers will
cover the devastated gardens.

Farewell, my brothers, farewell! In our next incursion we shall swim
across the Ebro, and our war-cry will reach even to Moncayo.
