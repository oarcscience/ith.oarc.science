### Chapter Second

How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel Rode Forth Errant Together and How Sir
Lionel Met Sir Turquine to His Great Dole. Also How Sir Ector Grieved
for the Departure of His Brother Launcelot and So, Following Him, Fell
into a Very Sorry Adventure.

NOW after King Arthur had thus given Sir Launcelot leave to go errant
and whilst Sir Launcelot was making himself ready to depart there came
to him Sir Lionel, who was his cousin germain, and Sir Lionel besought
leave to go with him as his knight-companion, and Sir Launcelot gave him
that leave.

So when King Arthur confirmed Sir Launcelot's permission Sir Lionel

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel depart in search of adventure*. |

also made himself ready very joyfully, and early of the morning of the
next day they two took their leave of the court and rode away together;
the day being very fair and gracious and all the air full of the joy of
that season--which was in the flower of the spring-time.

So, about noon-tide, they came to a certain place where a great
apple-tree stood by a hedge, and by that time they had grown
an-hungered. So they tied their horses near-by in a cool and shady place
and straightway sat them down under the apple-tree in the soft tall
grass, which was yet fresh with the coolness of the morning.

Then when they had ended their meal Sir Launcelot said: "Brother, I have
a great lust to sleep for a little space, for I find myself so drowsy
that mine eyelids are like scales of lead." Unto which Sir Lionel made
reply:

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Launcelot sleepeth beneath an apple-tree*. |

"Very well; sleep thou for a while, and I will keep watch, and after
that thou shalt watch, and I will sleep for a little space." So Sir
Launcelot put his helmet beneath his head and turned upon his side, and
in a little had fallen into a sleep which had neither dream nor thought
of any kind, but which was deep and pure like to a clear well of water
in the forest.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

And, whilst he slept thus, Sir Lionel kept watch, walking up and down in
the shade of a hedge near-by.

Where they were was upon the side of a hill, and beneath them was a
little valley; and a road ran through the valley, very white and shining
in the sunlight, like a silken ribbon, and the road lay between growing
fields of corn and pasture-land. Now as Sir Lionel walked beside the
hedge

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Lionel perceives how one knight pursues three knights*. |

he beheld three knights come riding into that valley and along that road
with very great speed and in several clouds of dust; and behind them
came a fourth knight, who was very huge of frame and who was clad
altogether in black armor. Moreover, this knight rode upon a black horse
and his shield was black and his spear was black and the furniture of
his horse was black, so that everything appertaining to that knight was
as black as any raven.

And Sir Lionel beheld that this one knight pursued those other three
knights and that his horse went with greater speed than theirs, so that
by and by he overtook the hindermost knight. And Sir Lionel beheld that
the sable knight smote the fleeing knight a great buffet with his sword,
so that that knight fell headlong from his horse and rolled over two or
three times upon the ground and then lay as though he were dead. Then
the black knight catched the second of the three, and served him as he
had served his fellow. Then the third of the three, finding that there
was no escape for him, turned as if to defend himself; but the black
knight drave at him, and smote him so terrible a blow that I believe had
a thunderbolt smitten him he would not have fallen from his horse more
suddenly than he did. For, though that combat was full three furlongs
away, yet Sir Lionel heard the sound of that blow as clearly as though
it had been close by.

Then after the black knight had thus struck down those three knights he
went to each in turn and tied his hands behind his back. Then, lifting
each man with extraordinary ease, he laid him across the saddle of that
horse from which he had fallen, as though he were a sack of grain. And
all this Sir Lionel beheld with very great wonder, marvelling much at
the strength and prowess of that black knight. "Ha," quoth he to
himself, "I will go and inquire into this business, for it may haply be
that yonder black knight shall not find it to be so easy to deal with a
knight of the Round Table as with those other three knights."

So, with this, Sir Lionel loosed his horse very quietly and went his way
so softly that Sir Launcelot was not awakened. And after he had gone
some way, he mounted his steed and rode off at a fast gallop down into
that valley.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

When Sir Lionel had come to that place where the knight was, he found
that he had just bound the last of the three knights upon the saddle of
his horse as aforetold. So Sir Lionel spoke to the sable knight

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Lionel addresses the sable knight*. |

in this wise: "Sir, I pray you tell me your name and degree and why you
treat those knights in so shameful a fashion as I behold you to do."

"Messire," said the black knight very fiercely, "this matter concerns
you not at all; yet I may tell you that those knights whom I have
overthrown are knights of King Arthur's court, and so I serve all such
as come into this place. So will I serve you, too, if you be a knight of
King Arthur's."

"Well," said Sir Lionel, "that is a very ungracious thing for you to
say. And as for that, I too am a knight of King Arthur's court, but I do
not believe that you will serve me as you have served those three.
Instead of that, I have great hope that I shall serve you in such a
fashion that I shall be able to set these knights free from your hands."

Thereupon, without more ado, he made him ready with spear and shield,
and the black knight, perceiving his design, also made him ready. Then
they rode a little distance apart so as to have a fair course for a tilt
upon the roadway. Then each set spur to his horse and the two drave
together with such violence that the earth shook beneath them. So they
met fair

|------------------------------------------|
| *The sable knight overcomes Sir Lionel*. |

in the middle of the course, but lo! in that encounter the spear of Sir
Lionel broke into as many as thirty or forty pieces, but the spear of
the black knight held, so that Sir Lionel was lifted clean out from his
saddle and over the crupper of his horse with such violence that when he
smote the ground he rolled three times over ere he ceased to fall. And
because of that fierce, terrible blow he swooned away entirely, and all
was black before his eyes, and he knew nothing.

Therewith the black knight dismounted and tied Sir Lionel's arms behind,
his back and he laid him across the saddle of his horse as he had laid
those others across the saddles of their horses; and he tied him there
very securely with strong cords so that Sir Lionel could not move.

And all this while Sir Launcelot slept beneath the apple-tree upon the
hillside, for he was greatly soothed by the melodious humming of the
bees in the blossoms above where he lay.

Now you are to know that he who had thus taken Sir Lionel and those
three knights prisoner was one Sir Turquine, a very cruel, haughty
knight, who had a great and strong castle out beyond the mouth of that
valley in which these knights took combat as aforetold. Moreover, it was
the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

custom of Sir Turquine to make prisoner all the knights and ladies who
came that way; and all the knights and ladies who were not of King
Arthur's court he set free when they had paid a sufficient ransom

|                                     |
|-------------------------------------|
| *Of Sir Turquine the sable knight*. |

unto him; but the knights who were of King Arthur's court, and
especially those who were of the Round Table, he held prisoner for aye
within his castle. The dungeon of that castle was a very cold, dismal,
and unlovely place, and it was to this prison that he proposed to take
those four knights whom he had overcome, with intent to hold them
prisoner as aforetold.

And now turn we to King Arthur's court, and consider what befell there
after Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel had left it in search of adventures.

 

When Sir Ector found that Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel had gone away in
that fashion he was very much grieved in spirit; wherefore he said to
himself, "Meseems my brother might have taken me with him as well as our
cousin." So he went to King Arthur and besought his leave to quit the
court and to ride after those other two and to join in their

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Ector follows Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel*. |

adventures, and King Arthur very cheerfully gave him that leave. So Sir
Ector made him ready with all despatch, and rode away at a great gait
after Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel. And ever as Sir Ector rode he made
diligent inquiry and he found that those two knights had ridden before
him, so he said to himself: "By and by I shall overtake them-if not
to-day, at least by night, or by to-morrow day."

But after a while he came to a cross-roads, and there he took a way that
Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel had not taken; so that, after he had gone a
distance, he found that he had missed them by taking that road.
Nevertheless, he went on until about the prime of the day, what time he
met a forester, to whom he said: "Sirrah, saw you two knights ride this
way--one knight clad in white armor with a white shield upon which was
depicted the figure of a lady, and the other knight clad in red armor
with the figure of a red gryphon upon his shield?" "Nay," said the
forester, "I saw not such folk." Then said Sir Ector, "Is there any
adventure to be found hereabouts?" Upon this the forester fell to
laughing in great measure. "Yea," he said, "there is an adventure to be
found hard by

|                              |
|------------------------------|
| *Sir Ector seeks adventure*. |

and it is one that many have undertaken and not one yet hath ever
fulfilled." Then Sir Ector said, "Tell me what that adventure is and I
will undertake it."

"Sir," said the forester, "if you will follow along yonder road for a
distance, you will find a very large, strong castle surrounded by a
broad

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

moat. In front of that castle is a stream of water with a fair, shallow
ford, where the roadway crosses the water. Upon this side of that ford
there groweth a thorn-tree, very large and sturdy, and upon it hangs a
basin of brass. Strike upon that basin with the butt of your spear, and
you shall presently meet with that adventure concerning which I have
just now spoken." "Fellow," said Sir Ector, "grammercy for your news."
And, therewith, straightway he rode off in search of that adventure.

He rode a great distance at a very fast gait and by and by he came to
the top of a hill and therewith he saw before him the mouth of a fair
valley. Across from where he stood was another hill not very large or
high, but exceedingly steep and rocky. Upon this farther hill was
builded a tall, noble castle of gray stone with many towers and spires
and tall chimneys and with several score of windows, all shining bright
in the clear weather. A fair river ran down into the mouth of that
valley and it was as bright and as smooth as silver, and on each side of
it were smooth level meadow-lands--very green--and here and there shady
groves of trees and plantations of fruit-trees. And Sir Ector perceived
that the road upon which he travelled crossed the aforesaid river by a
shallow ford, and he wist that this must be the ford whereof the
forester had spoken. So he rode down unto that ford, and when he had
come nigh he perceived the thorn-tree of which the forester had told
him, and he saw that a great basin of brass hung to the thorn-tree, just
as the forester had said.

Then Sir Ector rode to that thorn-tree and he smote upon that basin of
brass with the butt of his spear, so that the basin rang with a noise
like

|                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Ector smites upon the brazen basin*. |

thunder; and he smote it again and again, several times over. But though
he was aware of a great commotion within that fair castle, yet no
adventure befell him, although he smote the brazen basin several times.

Now, his horse being athirst, Sir Ector drove him into the ford that he
might drink, and whilst he was there he was suddenly aware where, on the
other side of the stream, was a singular party coming along the roadway.
For first of all there rode a knight entirely clad in black, riding upon
a black horse, and all the harness and furniture of that horse entirely
of black. Behind him, that knight led four horses as though they were
pack-horses, and across each one of those four horses was a knight in
full armor, bound fast to the saddle like to a sack of grain, whereat
Sir Ector was very greatly astonished.

As soon as that sable knight approached the castle, several came running
forth and relieved him of those horses he led and took them into the
castle, and as soon as he had been thus relieved the sable knight rode

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

very violently up to where Sir Ector was. As soon as he had come to the
water's edge he cried out: "Sir Knight, come forth from out of that
water and do me battle."

"Very well," said Sir Ector, "I will do so, though it will, I think, be
to thy very great discomfort."

With that he came quickly out from the ford, the water whereof was all
broken and churned into foam at his passing, and straightway

| *Sir Ector essays battle with the sable knight*. |

he cast aside his spear and drew his sword and, driving against that
sable knight, he smote him such a buffet that his horse turned twice
about.

"Ha," said the black knight, "that is the best blow that ever I had
struck me in all of my life." Therewith he rushed upon Sir Ector, and
without using a weapon of any sort he catched him about the body,
underneath the arms, and dragged him clean out of his saddle, and flung
him across the horn of his own saddle. Thereupon, having accomplished
this marvellous feat, and with Sir Ector still across his saddle-bow, he
rode up unto his castle, nor stopped until he had reached the court-yard
of the keep. There he set Sir Ector down upon the stone pavement. Then
he said: "Messire, thou hast done to me this day what no other knight
hath ever done to me before, wherefore, if thou wilt promise to be my
man from henceforth, I will let thee go free and give thee great rewards
for thy services as well."

But Sir Ector was filled very full of shame, wherefore he cried out
fiercely, "Rather would I lie within a prison all my life than serve so
catiff a knight as thou, who darest to treat other knights as thou hast
just now treated me."

"Well," said the black knight very grimly, "thou shalt have thy choice."
Therewith he gave certain orders, whereupon a great many fierce fellows
set upon Sir Ector and stripped him of all his armor, and immediately
haled him off, half-naked, to that dungeon aforementioned.

There he found many knights of King Arthur's court, and several of the
Round Table, all of whom he knew, and when they beheld Sir Ector flung
in unto them in that fashion they lifted up their voices in

| *The sable knight makes prisoner of Sir Ector*. |

great lamentation that he should have been added to their number,
instead of freeing them from their dolorous and pitiable case. "Alas,"
said they, "there is no knight alive may free us from this dungeon,
unless it be Sir Launcelot. For this Sir Turquine is, certes, the
greatest knight in all the world, unless it be Sir Launcelot."
