### Chapter Seventh

How Sir Tristram had speech with King Angus of Ireland; how he undertook
to champion the cause of King Angus and of what happened thereafter.

NOW, as Sir Tristram and King Arthur and Sir Launcelot sat together in
the pavilion of Sir Tristram in pleasant, friendly discourse, as
aforetold, there came Gouvernail of a sudden into that place. He, coming
to Sir Tristram, leaned over his shoulder and he whispered into his ear:
"Sir, I have just been told that King Angus of Ireland is at this very
time at Camelot at the court of the King."

Upon this Sir Tristram turned to King Arthur and said: "Lord, my esquire
telleth me that King Angus of Ireland is here at Camelot; now I pray you
tell me, is that saying true?" "Yea," said King Arthur,

|------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Tristram hears news of King Angus*. |

"that is true; but what of it?" "Well," said Sir Tristram, "I had set
forth to seek King Angus in Ireland, when I and my companions were
driven hither by a great storm of wind. Yet when I find him, I know not
whether King Angus may look upon me as a friend or as an unfriend."

"Ha," said King Arthur, "you need not take trouble concerning the regard
in which King Angus shall hold you. For he is at this time in such
anxiety of spirit that he needs to have every man his friend

|                                           |

| *How Sir Bertrand was killed in Ireland*. |

who will be his friend, and no man his enemy whom he can reconcile to
him. He is not just now in very good grace, either with me or with my
court, for the case with him is thus: Some while ago, after you left the
court of Ireland, there came to that place Sir Blamor de Ganys (who is
right cousin to Sir Launcelot of the Lake) and with Sir Blamor a
knight-companion hight Sir Bertrand de la Riviere Rouge. These two
knights went to Ireland with intent to win themselves honor at the court
of Ireland. Whilst they were in that kingdom there were held many jousts
and tourneys, and in all of them Sir Blamor and Sir Bertrand were
victorious, and all the knights of Ireland who came against them were
put to shame at their hands. Many of the Irish knights were exceedingly
angry at this, and so likewise was the King of Ireland. Now it happened
one day that Sir

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Bertrand was found dead and murdered at a
certain pass in the King's forest, and when the news thereof was brought
to Sir Blamor, he was very wroth that his knight-companion should have
been thus treacherously slain. So he immediately quitted Ireland and
returned hither straightway, and when he had come before me he accused
King Angus of treason because of that murder. Now at this time King
Angus is here upon my summons for to answer that charge and to defend
himself therefrom; for Sir Blamor offers his body to defend the truth of
his accusation, and as for the King of Ireland, he can find no knight to
take his part in that contention. For not only is Sir Blamor, as you
very well know, one of the best knights in the world, but also nearly
everybody here hath doubt of the innocence of King Angus in this affair.
Now from this you may see that King Angus is very much more in need of a
friend at this time than he is of an enemy."

"Lord," said Sir Tristram, "what you tell me is very excellent good
news, for now I know that I may have talk with King Angus with safety to
myself, and that he will no doubt receive me as a friend."

So after King Arthur and his court had taken their departure--it being
then in the early sloping of the afternoon--Sir Tristram called
Gouvernail to him and bade him make ready their horses, and when
Gouvernail had done so, they two mounted and rode away by themselves
toward that place where King Angus had taken up his lodging. When they
had come there, Sir Tristram made demand to have speech with the King,
and therewith they in attendance ushered him in to where the King Angus
was.

But when King Angus saw Sir Tristram who he was, and when he beheld a
face that was both familiar and kind, he gave a great cry of joy, and

|                                     |
|-------------------------------------|
| *King Angus welcomes Sir Tristram*. |

ran to Sir Tristram and flung his arms about him, and kissed him upon
the cheek; for he was rejoiced beyond measure to find a friend in that
unfriendly place.

Then Sir Tristram said, "Lord, what cheer have you?" Unto that King
Angus replied: "Tristram, I have very poor cheer; for I am alone amongst
enemies with no one to befriend me, and unless I find some knight who
will stand my champion to-morrow or the next day I am like to lose my
life for the murder of Sir Bertrand de la Riviere Rouge. And where am I
to find any one to act as my champion in defence of my innocence in this
place, where I behold an enemy in every man whom I meet? Alas, Tristram!
There is no one in all the world who will aid me unless it be you, for
you alone of all the knights in the world beyond the circle of the
knights of the Round Table may hope to stand against so excellent and so
strong a hero!"

"Lord," quoth Sir Tristram, "I know very well what great trouble
overclouds you at this time, and it is because of that that I am come
hither

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

for to visit you. For I have not at any time forgotten how that I told
you when you spared my life in Ireland that mayhap the time might come
when I might serve as your friend in your day of need. So if you will
satisfy me upon two points, then I myself will stand for your champion
upon this occasion."

"Ah, Tristram," quoth King Angus, "what you say is very good news to me
indeed. For I believe there is no other knight in all the world (unless
it be Sir Launcelot of the Lake) who is so strong and worthy a knight as
you. So tell me what are those two matters concerning which you would
seek satisfaction, and, if it is possible for me to do so, I will give
you such an answer as may please you."

"Lord," said Sir Tristram, "the first matter is this: that you shall
satisfy me that you are altogether innocent of the death of Sir
Bertrand. And the second matter is this: that you shall grant me
whatsoever favor it is that I shall have to ask of you."

Then King Angus arose and drew his sword and he said: "Tristram, behold;
here is my sword-and the guard thereof and the blade thereof and the
handle thereof make that holy sign of the cross unto

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| *King Angus swears innocence to Sir Tristram*. |

which all Christian men bow down to worship. Look! See! Here I kiss that
holy sign and herewith I swear an oath upon that sacred symbol, and I
furthermore swear upon the honor of my knighthood, that I am altogether
guiltless of the death of that noble, honorable knight aforesaid. Nor do
I at all know how it was he met his death, for I am innocent of all evil
knowledge thereof. Now, Messire, art thou satisfied upon that point?"
And Sir Tristram said, "I am satisfied."

Then King Angus said: "As to the matter of granting you a favor, that I
would do in any case for the love I bear you. So let me hear what it is
that you have to ask of me."

"Lord," cried out Sir Tristram, "the favor is one I had liever die than
ask. It is this: that you give me your daughter, the Lady

|                               |
|-------------------------------|
| *Sir Tristram asks his boon*. |

Belle Isoult, for wife unto mine uncle, King Mark of Cornwall."

Upon these words, King Angus sat in silence for a long while, gazing
very strangely upon Sir Tristram. Then by and by he said: "Messire, this
is a very singular thing you ask of me; for from what you said to me
aforetime and from what you said to my daughter I had thought that you
desired the Lady Belle Isoult for yourself. Now I can in no wise
understand why you do not ask for her in your name instead of asking for
her in the name of King Mark."

Then Sir Tristram cried out as in great despair: "Messire, I love that
dear lady a great deal more than I love my life; but in this affair I am
fulfilling

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

a pledge made upon the honor of my knighthood and unto the King of
Cornwall, who himself made me knight. For I pledged him unaware, and now
I am paying for my hastiness. Yet I would God that you might take the
sword which you hold in your hand and thrust it through my heart; for I
had liefer die than fulfil this obligation to which I am pledged."

"Well," said King Angus, "you know very well that I will not slay you,
but that I will fulfil your boon as I have promised. As for what you do
in this affair, you must answer for it to God and to the honor of your
own knighthood whether it is better to keep that promise which you made
to the King of Cornwall or to break it."

Then Sir Tristram cried out again in great travail of soul: "Lord, you
know not what you say, nor what torments I am at this present moment
enduring." And therewith he arose and went forth from that place, for he
was ashamed that anyone should behold the passion that moved him.

 

And now is to be told of that famous battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir
Blamor de Ganys of which so much hath been written in all the several
histories of chivalry that deal with these matters.

 

Now when the next morning had come--clear and fair and with the sun
shining wonderfully bright--a great concourse of people began to betake
themselves to that place where the lists had been set up in preparation
for that ordeal of battle. That place was on a level meadow of grass
very fair bedight with flowers and not far from the walls of the town
nor from the high road that led to the gate of the same.

And, indeed, that was a very beautiful place for battle, for upon the
one hand was the open countryside, all gay with spring blossoms and
flowers; and

|                            |
|----------------------------|
| *Of the meadow of battle*. |

upon the other hand were the walls of the town. Over above the top of
those walls was to be seen a great many tall towers--some built of stone
and some of brick--that rose high up into the clear, shining sky all
full of slow-drifting clouds, that floated, as it were, like
full-breasted swans in a sea of blue. And beyond the walls of the town
you might behold a great many fair houses with bright windows of glass
all shining against the sky. So you may see how fair was all that place,
where that fierce battle was presently to be fought.

Meanwhile, great multitudes of people had gathered all about the meadow
of battle, and others stood like flies upon the walls of the town and
looked down into that fair, pleasant meadow-land, spread with its carpet
of flowers. All along one side of the ground of battle was a scaffolding
of seats fair bedraped with fabrics of various colors and textures. In
the midst of all

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

the other seats were two seats hung with cloth of scarlet, and these
seats were the one for King Arthur and the other for King Angus of
Ireland.

In the centre of the meadow-land Sir Blamor rode up and down very
proudly. He was clad in red armor, and the trappings and the furniture
of his horse were all of red, so that he paraded the field like a
crimson flame of fire.

"Sir," quoth King Arthur to King Angus, "yon is a very strong, powerful,
noble knight; now where mayst thou find one who can hope to stand
against him in this coming battle?"

"Lord," said King Angus, "I do believe that God hath raised up a
defender for me in this extremity. For Sir Tristram of

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| *King Angus Presents Sir Tristram for his champion*. |

Lyonesse came to me yesterday, and offered for to take this quarrel of
mine upon him. Now I do not believe that there is any better knight in
all of Christendom than he, wherefore I am to-day uplifted with great
hopes that mine innocence shall be proved against mine accuser."

"Ha!" quoth King Arthur, "if Sir Tristram is to stand thy champion in
this affair, then I do believe that thou hast indeed found for thyself a
very excellent, worthy defender."

So anon there came Sir Tristram riding to that place, attended only by
Gouvernail. And he was clad all in bright, polished armor so that he
shone like a star of great splendor as he entered the field of battle.
He came straight to where King Arthur sat and saluted before him. King
Arthur said, "Sir, what knight art thou?" "Lord," answered he, "I am Sir
Tristram of Lyonesse, and I am come to champion King Angus who sits
beside you. For I believe him to be innocent of that matter of which he
is accused, and I will emperil my body in that belief for to prove the
truth of the same."

"Well," quoth King Arthur, "this King accused hath, certes, a very noble
champion in thee. So go and do thy devoirs, and may God defend the
right."

Thereupon each knight took a good stout spear into his hand and chose
his place for the encounter, and each set his shield before him and
feutered his lance in rest. Then, when each was ready, the marshal

|                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Tristram does battle with Sir Blamor*. |

blew a great blast upon his trumpet, and thereupon, in an instant, each
knight launched against the other like a bolt of thunder. So they met in
the very middle of the course with such violence that the spear of each
knight was shattered all into pieces unto the very truncheon thereof.
Each horse fell back upon his haunches, and each would no doubt, have
fallen entirely, had not the knight-rider recovered his steed with the
greatest skill and address.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

Then each knight voided his saddle and each drew his sword and set his
shield before him. Therewith they came to battle on foot like two wild
boars--so fiercely and felly that it was terrible to behold. For they
traced this way and that and foined and struck at one another so that
whole pieces of armor were hewn from the bodies of each.

But in all this battle Sir Tristram had so much the better that, by and
by after they had fought for above an hour, Sir Blamor de Ganys began

|                                      |
|--------------------------------------|
| *Sir Tristram overcomes Sir Blamor*. |

to bare back before him, and to give ground, holding his shield low for
weariness. This Sir Tristram perceived, and, running in suddenly upon
Sir Blamor, he struck him so terrible a blow upon the right shoulder
that Sir Blamor's arm was altogether benumbed thereby, and he could no
longer hold his sword in his hand.

So the sword of Sir Blamor fell down into the grass, and Sir Tristram,
perceiving this, ran and set his foot upon it. Then Sir Blamor could not
stand any longer, but fell down upon his knees because of a great
weariness and faintness that lay upon him like the weariness and
faintness of approaching death.

Then Sir Tristram said: "Sir Knight, thou canst fight no longer. Now I
bid thee for to yield thyself to me as overcome in this battle."

Thereunto Sir Blamor made reply, speaking very deep and hollow from out
of his helmet: "Sir Knight, thou hast overcome me by thy strength and
prowess, but I will not yield myself to thee now nor at any time. For
that would be so great shame that I would rather die than endure it. I
am a knight of the Round Table, and have never yet been overcome in this
wise by any man. So thou mayst slay me, but I will not yield myself to
thee."

Then Sir Tristram cried out: "Sir Knight, I beseech thee to yield
thyself, for thou art not fit to fight any more this day."

Sir Blamor said, "I will not yield, so strike and have done with it."

So Sir Tristram wist not what to do, but stood there in doubt looking
down upon Sir Blamor. Then Sir Blamor said, again: "Strike, Sir Knight,
and have done with it."

Upon this Sir Tristram said: "I may not strike thee, Sir Blamor de
Ganys, to slay thee, for thou art very nigh of blood to Sir Launcelot of
the Lake, and unto him I have sworn brotherhood in arms; wherefore I
pray thee now to yield thyself to me."

Sir Blamor said, "Nay, I will not yield me to thee."

"Well," said Sir Tristram, "then I must fain act this day in a manner
like as I acted yesterday."

Therewith speaking, he took his sword into both his hands and he swung

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

it several times around his head and when he had done that he flung it
to a great distance away, so that he was now entirely unarmed saving
only for his misericordia. After that he gave Sir Blamor his hand and
lifted him up upon his feet. And he stooped and picked up Sir Blamor's
sword out of the grass and gave it back to Sir Blamor into his hands,
and he said: "Sir Knight, now thou art armed and I am entirely unarmed,
and so thou hast me at thy mercy. Now thou shalt either yield thyself to
me or slay me as I stand here without any weapon; for I cannot now
strike thee, and though I have overcome thee fairly yet thou hast it now
in thy power to slay me. So now do thy will with me in this matter."

Then Sir Blamor was greatly astonished at the magnanimity of Sir
Tristram, and he said, "Sir Knight, what is thy name?" Sir Tristram
said, "It is Tristram, surnamed of Lyonesse."

Upon this Sir Blamor came to Sir Tristram and put his arms about his
shoulders, and he said: "Tristram, I yield myself to thee, but in love
and not in hate. For I yield myself not because of thy strength of arms
(and yet I believe there is no knight in the world, unless it be my
cousin Sir Launcelot of the Lake, who is thy peer), but I yield me
because of thy exceeding nobility. Yet I would that I might only be
satisfied that this King of Ireland is no traitor."

"Messire," said Sir Tristram, "of that I have assured myself very
strongly ere I entered into this contest, wherefore I may now freely
avouch upon mine own knightly word that he is innocent."

"Then," said Sir Blamor, "I also am satisfied, and I herewith withdraw
all my impeachment against him."

Then those two noble, excellent knights took one another by the hand and
went forward together to where King Arthur sat in high estate, and all
those who looked on and beheld that reconciliation gave loud

|                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Tristram and Sir Blamor are reconciled*. |

acclaim. And when King Arthur beheld them coming thus, he arose from
where he sat and met them and embraced them both, and he said: "I do not
believe that any king can have greater glory in his life than this, to
have such knights about him as ye be."

So ended this famous battle with great glory to Sir Tristram and yet
with no disregard, to that famous knight against whom he did battle.

After that, they and King Arthur and King Angus of Ireland and all the
court went up unto the castle of Camelot, and there the two
knights-combatant were bathed in tepid water and their wounds were
searched and dressed and they were put at their ease in all ways that it
was possible.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

Now that very day, as they all sat at feast in the castle of Camelot,
there came one with news that the name of Sir Tristram had suddenly
appeared upon one of the seats of the Round Table. So after they had
ended their feast they all immediately went to see how that might be.
When they came to the pavilion of the Round Table, there, behold! was
his name indeed upon that seat that had once been the seat of King
Pellinore. For this was the name that now was upon that seat:

SIR TRISTRAM  
OF  
LYONESSE

So the next day Sir Tristram was duly installed as a knight-companion

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| *Sir Tristram becomes knight of the Round Table*. |

of the Round Table with a great pomp and estate of circumstance, and a
day or two after that he set sail for Ireland with King Angus, taking
with him Gouvernail and those Cornish knights who were his companions.

So they all reached Ireland in safety, and, because Sir Tristram had
aided the King of Ireland in the day of his extremity, the Queen forgave
him all the despite she held against him, so that he was received at the
court of the King and Queen with great friendship and high honor.

 

For a while Sir Tristram dwelt in Ireland and said nothing concerning

|                                      |
|--------------------------------------|
| *How Sir Tristram dwelt in Ireland*. |

that purpose for which he had come. Then one day he said to King Angus:
"Lord, thou art not to forget to fulfil that promise which thou madst to
me concerning the Lady Belle Isoult."

To this King Angus made reply: "I had hoped that now we were come to
Ireland you had changed your purpose in that matter. Are you yet of the
same mind as when you first spake to me?"

"Yea," said Sir Tristram, "for it cannot be otherwise."

"Well, then," said King Angus, "I shall go to prepare my daughter for
this ill-hap that is to befall her, though indeed it doth go against my
heart to do such a thing. After I have first spoken to her, you are to
take the matter into your own hands, for, to tell you the truth, I have
not the heart to contrive it further."

So King Angus went away from where Sir Tristram was, and he was gone a
long while. When he returned he said: "Sir, go you that way and the Lady
Belle Isoult will see you."

So Sir Tristram went in the direction King Angus had said, and a page
showed him the way. So by and by he came to where the Lady Belle

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Isoult was, and it was a great chamber in a
certain tower of the castle and high up under the eaves of the roof.

The Lady Belle Isoult stood upon the farther side of this chamber so
that the light from the windows shone full upon her face, and Sir
Tristram perceived that she was extraordinarily beautiful, and rather

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| *How Lady Belle Isoult appeared to Sir Tristram*. |

like to a shining spirit than to a lady of flesh and blood. For she was
clad altogether in white and her face was like to wax for whiteness and
clearness, and she wore ornaments of gold set with shining stones of
divers colors about her neck and about her arms so that they glistered
with a wonderful lustre. Her eyes shone very bright and clear like one
with a fever, and Sir Tristram beheld that there were channels of tears
upon her face and several tears stood upon her white checks like to
shining jewels hanging suspended there.

So, for a while, Sir Tristram stood still without speaking and regarded
her from afar. Then after a while she spake and said, "Sir, what is this
you have done?" "Lady," he said, "I have done what God set me to do,
though I would rather die than do it."

She said, "Tristram, you have betrayed me." Upon the which he cried out
in a very loud and piercing voice, "Lady, say not so!"

She said: "Tristram, tell me, is it better to fulfil this pledge you
have made, knowing that in so doing you sacrifice both my happiness and
your happiness to satisfy your pride of honor; or is it better that you
sacrifice your pride and break this promise so that we may both be
happy? Tristram, I beseech you to break this promise you have made and
let us be happy together."

At this Sir Tristram cried out in a very loud voice: "Lady, did you put
your hand into my bosom and tear my naked heart, you could not cause me
so much pain as that which I this moment endure. It cannot be as you
would have it, for it is thus with me: were it but myself whom I might
consider, I would freely sacrifice both my life and my honor for your
sake. But it may not be so, lady; for I am held to be one of the
chiefest of that order of knighthood to which I belong, wherefore I may
not consider myself, but must ever consider that order. For if I should
violate a pledge given upon my knighthood, then would I dishonor not
myself, but that entire order to which I belong. For, did I so, all the
world would say, what virtue is there in the order of knighthood when
one of the chiefest of that order may violate his pledge when it pleases
him to do so? So, lady, having assumed that great honor of knighthood I
must perform its obligations even to the uttermost; yea, though in
fulfilling my pledge I sacrifice both thee and myself."

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

Then Belle Isoult looked upon Sir Tristram for some little while, and by
and by she smiled very pitifully and said: "Ah, Tristram, I believe I am
more sorry for thee than I am for myself."

"Lady," said Tristram, "I would God that I lay here dead before you. But
I am not able to die, but am altogether strong and hale--only very
sorrowful at heart." And therewith he turned and left that place. Only
when he had come to a place where he was entirely by himself with no one
but God to see him, he hid his face in his hands and wept as though his
heart were altogether broken. So it was that Sir Tristram fulfilled his
pledge.

After that, King Angus furnished a very noble and beautiful ship with

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| *Belle Isoult and Sir Tristram depart for Cornwall*. |

sails of satin embroidered with figures of divers sorts, and he fitted
the ship in all ways such as became the daughter of a king and the wife
of a king to embark upon. And that ship was intended for the Lady Belle
Isoult and Sir Tristram in which to sail to the court of Cornwall.

And it was ordained that a certain very excellent lady of the court of
the Queen, who had been attendant upon the Lady Belle Isoult when she
was a little child and who had been with her in attendance ever since
that time, should accompany her to the Court of Cornwall. And the name
of this lady was the Lady Bragwaine.

Now the day before the Lady Belle Isoult was to take her departure from
Ireland, the Queen of Ireland came to the Lady Bragwaine and she bare

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *The Queen of Ireland provides a love potion for King Mark and Belle Isoult*. |

with her a flagon of gold very curiously wrought. And the Queen said:
"Bragwaine, here is a flask of a very singular and precious sort of an
elixir; for that liquor it is of such a sort that when a man and a woman
drink of it together, they two shall thereafter never cease to love one
another as long as they shall have life. Take this flask, and when you
have come to Cornwall, and when the Lady Belle Isoult and King Mark have
been wedded, then give them both to drink of this elixir; for after they
have drunk they shall forget all else in the world and cleave only to
one another. This I give you to the intent that the Lady Isoult may
forget Sir Tristram, and may become happy in the love of King Mark whom
she shall marry."

Soon thereafter the Lady Belle Isoult took leave of the King and the
Queen and entered into that ship that had been prepared for her. Thus,
with Sir Tristram and with Dame Bragwaine and with their attendants, she
set sail for Cornwall.

Now it happened that, whilst they were upon that voyage, the Lady
Bragwaine came of a sudden into the cabin of that ship and there she
beheld

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

the Lady Belle Isoult lying upon a couch weeping. Dame Bragwaine said,
"Lady, why do you weep?" Whereunto the Lady Belle Isoult made reply:
"Alas, Bragwaine, how can I help but weep seeing that I am to be parted
from the man I love and am to be married unto another whom I do not
love?"

Dame Bragwaine laughed and said: "Do you then weep for that? See! Here
is a wonderful flask as it were of precious wine. When you are married
to the King of Cornwall, then you are to quaff of it and he is to quaff
of it and after that you will forget all others in the world and cleave
only to one another. For it is a wonderful love potion and it hath been
given to me to use in that very way. Wherefore dry your eyes, for
happiness may still lay before you."

When the Lady Belle Isoult heard these words she wept no more but smiled
very strangely. Then by and by she arose and went away to where Sir
Tristram was.

When she came to him she said, "Tristram, will you drink of a draught
with me?" He said, "Yea, lady, though it were death in the draught." She
said, "There is not death in it, but something very different," and
thereupon she went away into the cabin where that chalice aforesaid was
hidden. And at that time Dame Bragwaine was not there.

Then the Lady Belle Isoult took the flagon from where it was hidden, and
poured the elixir out into a chalice of gold and crystal and she brought
it to where Sir Tristram was. When she had come there, she said,
"Tristram, I drink to thee," and therewith she drank the half of the
elixir there was in the chalice. Then she said, "Now drink thou the rest
to me."

Upon that Sir Tristram took the chalice and lifted it to his lips, and
drank all the rest of that liquor that was therein.

Now immediately Sir Tristram had drunk that elixir he felt it run like
fire through every vein in his body. Thereupon he cried out, "Lady, what
is this you have given me to drink?" She said: "Tristram, that was a
powerful love potion intended for King Mark and me. But now thou and I
have drunk of it and never henceforth can either of us love anybody in
all of the world but the other."

Then Sir Tristram catched her into his arms and he cried

out: "Isoult! Isoult! what hast thou done to us both? Was it not enough
that I should have been unhappy but that thou shouldst have chosen to be
unhappy also?"

Thereat the Lady Belle Isoult both wept and smiled, looking up into Sir
Tristram's face, and she said: "Nay, Tristram; I would rather be sorry
with

thee than happy with another." He said, "Isoult, there is much woe in
this for us both." She said, "I care not, so I may share it with thee."

Thereupon Sir Tristram kissed her thrice upon the face, and then
immediately put her away from him and he left her and went away by
himself in much agony of spirit.

Thereafter they reached the kingdom of Cornwall in safety, and the Lady
Belle Isoult and King Mark were wedded with much pomp and ceremony and
after that there was much feasting and every appearance of rejoicing.
