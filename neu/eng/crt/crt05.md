# PART I

### The Story of Launcelot

HERE beginneth the story of Sir Launcelot, surnamed of the Lake, who was
held by all men to be the most excellent, noble, perfect knight-champion
who was ever seen in the world from the very beginning of chivalry unto
the time when his son, Sir Galahad, appeared like a bright star of
extraordinary splendor shining in the sky of chivalry.

In this Book it shall be told how he was taken into a magic lake, how he
came out thence to be made knight by King Arthur, and of how he
undertook several of those adventures that made him at once the wonder
and the admiration of all men, and the chiefest glory of the Round Table
of Arthur-Pendragon.
