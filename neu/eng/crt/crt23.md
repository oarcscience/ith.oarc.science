# PART II

# The Story of Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorack

AND now shall be told the story of Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorack of
Gales, how they became brothers-in-arms; how Sir Lamorack took offence
at Sir Tristram, and how they became reconciled again.

But first of all you must know that Sir Lamorack of Gales was deemed to
be one of the greatest knights alive. For it was said that there were
three knights that were the greatest in all of the world, and those
three were Sir Launcelot of the Lake, Sir Tristram of Lyonesse, and Sir
Lamorack of Gales.

Sir Lamorack was the son of King Pellinore, of whom it hath already been
told in the Book of King Arthur that he was the greatest knight during
that time; and he was the brother of Sir Percival, of whom it is to be
told hereinafter that he was the peer even of Sir Launcelot of the Lake.
So because that house produced three such great and famous knights, the
house of King Pellinore hath always been singularly renowned in all
histories of chivalry. For indeed there was not any house so famous as
it saving only the house of King Ban of Benwick, which brought forth
those two peerless knights beyond all compare:--to wit, Sir Launcelot of
the Lake and Sir Galahad, who achieved the quest of the San Grail.

So I hope that you may find pleasure in the story of how Sir Tristram
and Sir Lamorack became acquainted, and of how they became
brothers-in-arms.
