# The Book of Sir Percival

HERE beginneth the story of Sir Percival of Gales, who was considered to
be one of the three great knights of the Round Table at that time. For,
if Sir Launcelot was the chiefest of all the knights who ever came unto
King Arthur's court, then it is hard to say whether Sir Tristram of
Lyonesse or Sir Percival of Gales was second unto him in renown.

And I pray that it shall be given unto all of ye to live as brave and
honorable and pure a life as he did; and that you, upon your part, may
claim a like glory and credit in the world in which you dwell by such
noble behavior as he exhibited.
