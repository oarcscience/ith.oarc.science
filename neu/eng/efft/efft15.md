"HE STRUCK A VIOLENT BLOW UPON THE MONSTER'S HEAD."

THE park and manor-house of Lambton, belonging to a family of the same
name, lie on the banks of the Wear, to the north of Lumley. The family
is a very ancient one, much older, it is believed, than the twelfth
century, to which date its pedigree extends. The old castle was
dismantled in 1797, when a site was adopted for the present mansion on
the north bank of the swiftly-flowing Wear, in a situation of exceeding
beauty. The park also contains the ruins of a chapel, called Brugeford
or Bridgeford, close to one of the bridges which span the Wear.

Long, long ago--some say about the fourteenth century--the young heir of
Lambton led a careless, profane life, regardless alike of his duties to
God and man, and in particular neglecting to attend mass, that he might
spend his Sunday mornings in fishing. One Sunday, while thus engaged,
having cast his line into the Wear many times without success, he vented
his disappointment in curses loud and deep, to the great scandal of the
servants and tenantry as they passed by to the chapel at Brugeford.

Soon afterwards he felt something tugging at his line, and trusting he
had at last secured a fine fish, he exerted all his skill and strength
to bring his prey to land. But what were his horror and dismay on
finding that, instead of a fish, he had only caught a worm of most
unsightly appearance I He hastily tore the thing from his hook, and
flung it into a well close by, which is still known by the name of the
Worm Well.

The young heir had scarcely thrown his line again into the stream when a
stranger of venerable appearance, passing by, asked him what sport he
had met with; to which he replied: "Why, truly, I think I have caught
the devil himself. Look in and judge." The stranger looked, and remarked
that he had never seen the like of it before; that it resembled an eft,
only it had nine holes on each side of its mouth; and, finally, that he
thought it boded no good.

The worm remained unheeded in the well till it outgrew so confined a
dwelling-place. It then emerged, and betook itself by day to the river,
where it lay coiled round a rock in the middle of the stream, and by
night to a neighbouring hill, round whose base it would twine itself;
while it continued to grow so fast that it soon could encircle the hill
three times. This eminence is still called the Worm Hill. It is oval in
shape, on the north side of the Wear, and about a mile and a half from
old Lambton Hall.

The monster now became the terror of the whole country side. It sucked
the cows' milk, worried the cattle, devoured the lambs, and committed
every sort of depredation on the helpless peasantry. Having laid waste
the district on the north side of the river, it crossed the stream and
approached Lambton Hall, where the old lord was living alone and
desolate. His son had repented of his evil life, and had gone to the
wars in a distant country. Some authorities tell us he had embarked as a
crusader for the Holy Land.

On hearing of their enemy's approach, the terrified household assembled
in council. Much was said, but to little purpose, till the steward, a
man of age and experience, advised that the large trough which stood in
the courtyard should immediately be filled with milk. This was done
without delay; the monster approached, drank the milk, and, without
doing further harm, returned across the Wear to wrap his giant form
around his favourite hill. The next day he was seen recrossing the
river; the trough was hastily filled again and with the same results. It
was found that the milk of "nine kye" was needed to fill the trough; and
if this quantity was not placed there every day, regularly and in full
measure, the worm would break out into a violent rage, lashing its tail
round the trees in the park, and tearing them up by the roots.

The Lambton Worm was now, in fact, the terror of the North Country. It
had not been left altogether unopposed. Many a gallant knight had come
out to fight with the monster, but all to no purpose; for it possessed
the marvellous power of reuniting itself after being cut asunder, and
thus was more than a match for the chivalry of the North. So, after many
conflicts, and much loss of life and limb, the creature was left in
possession of its favourite hill.

After seven long years, however, the heir of Lambton returned home, a
sadder and a wiser man--returned to find the broad lands of his
ancestors waste and desolate, his people oppressed and well-nigh
exterminated, his father sinking into the grave overwhelmed with care
and anxiety. He took no rest, we are told, till he had crossed the river
and surveyed the Worm as it lay coiled round the foot of the hill; then,
hearing how its former opponents had failed, he took counsel in the
matter from a sibyl or wise woman.

At first the sibyl did nothing but upbraid him for having brought this
scourge upon his house and neighbourhood; but when she perceived that he
was indeed penitent, and desirous at amy cost to remove the evil he had
caused, she gave him her advice and instructions. He was to get his best
suit of mail studded thickly with spear-heads, to put it on, and thus
armed to take his stand on the rock in the middle of the river, there to
meet his enemy, trusting the issue to Providence and his good sword. But
she charged him before going to the encounter to take a vow that, if
successful, he would slay the first living thing that met him on his way
homewards. Should he fail to fulfil this vow, she warned him that for
nine generations no lord of Lambton would die in his bed.

The heir, now a belted knight, made the vow in Brugeford chapel He
studded his armour with the sharpest spear-heads, and unsheathing his
trusty sword took his stand on the rock in the middle of the Wear. At
the accustomed hour the Worm uncoiled its "snaky twine," and wound its
way towards the hall, crossing the river close by the rock on which the
knight was standing eager for the combat. He struck a violent blow upon
the monster's head as it passed, on which the creature, "irritated and
vexed," though apparently not injured, flung its tail round him, as if
to strangle him in its coils.

In the words of a local poet--  
"The worm shot down the middle stream  
Like a flash of living light,  
And the waters kindled round his path  
In rainbow colours bright.  
But when he saw the armed knight  
He gathered all his pride,  
And, coiled in many a radiant spire,  
Rode buoyant o'er the tide.  
When he darted at length his dragon strength  
An earthquake shook the rock,  
And the fireflakes bright fell round the knight  
As unmoved he met the shock.  
Though his heart was stout it quailed no doubt,  
His very life-blood ran cold,  
As round and round the wild Worm wound  
In many a grappling fold."

Now was seen the value of the sibyl's advice. The closer the Worm
wrapped him in its folds the more deadly were its self-inflicted wounds,
till at last the river ran crimson with its gore. Its strength thus
diminished, the knight was able at last with his good sword to cut the
serpent in two; the severed part was immediately borne away by the
swiftness of the current, and the Worm, unable to reunite itself, was
utterly destroyed.

During this long and desperate conflict the household of Lambton had
shut themselves within-doors to pray for their young lord, he having
promised that when it was over he would, if conqueror, blow a blast on
his bugle. This would assure his father of his safety, and warn them to
let loose the favourite hound, which they had destined as the sacrifice
on the occasion, according to the sibyl's requirements and the young
lord's vow. When, however, the bugle-notes were heard within the hail,
the old man forgot everything but his son's safety, and rushing out of
doors, ran to meet the hero and embrace him.

The heir of Lambton was thunderstruck; what could he do? It was
impossible to lift his hand against his father; yet how else to fulfil
his vow? In his perplexity he blew another blast; the hound was let
loose, it bounded to its master; the sword, yet reeking with the
monster's gore, was plunged into its heart; but all in vain. The vow was
broken, the sibyl's prediction fulfilled, and the curse lay upon the
house of Lambton for nine generations.
