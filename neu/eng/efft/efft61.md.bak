# THE WHITE LADY OF BLENKINSOPP  <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)

LIKE almost all the old Northumbrian castles and peels, Blenkinsopp has
the reputation of being haunted. A gloomy vault under the castle is said
to have buried in it a large chest of gold, hidden in the troublous
times: some say by a lady whose spirit cannot rest so long as it is
there, and who used formerly to appear--though not, that we have heard,
for the last four or five decades--clothed in white from head to foot,
and so was known as "The White Lady."

About the beginning of this century several of the least ruinous
apartments in the castle were still occupied by a hind on the estate and
some cotters. Indeed, two or three of them continued to be so down to
the year 1820 or thereabouts. The visits of the White Lady seem to have
been unfrequent latterly, and for some considerable time they had
ceased. One night, however, shortly after retiring to rest, the hind and
his wife (so the story goes) were alarmed on hearing loud and reiterated
screams coming from an adjoining room, in which one of the children, a
boy of about eight years of age, had been laid to sleep. On hastily
rushing in to see what was the matter, they found the boy sitting
trembling on his pillow, terror-struck and bathed in perspiration. "The
White Lady! the White Lady!" he screamed, as soon as he saw them. "What
Lady?" cried the astonished parents, looking round the room; "there is
no lady here." "She is gone," replied the boy, "and she looked so angry
at me because I would not go with her. She was a fine lady, and she sat
down on my bedside and wrung her hands and cried sore. Then she kissed
me and asked me to go with her, and she would make me a rich man, as she
had buried a large box of gold many hundred years since, down in the
vault; and she would give it to me, as she could not rest so long as it
was there. When I told her I durst not go, she said she would carry me,
and she was lifting me up when I cried out and I frightened her away."
The hind and his wife, both very sensible people, concluded that the
child had been dreaming and at length succeeded in quieting him and
getting him to sleep. But for three successive nights they were
disturbed in the same manner, the boy repeating the same story with
little variation, so that they were forced to let him sleep in the same
apartment with themselves, when the apparition no longer visited him.
The effect upon the boy's mind however, was such that nothing ever
afterwards would induce him to enter into any part of the old castle
alone even in daylight.

The legend of the White Lady is not one of those that unsophisticated
country people willingly let die; and the belief that treasure lies
hidden under the grim old ruin waiting to be disinterred, is probably
still entertained by not a few. Indeed, there is hardly a place of the
kind, either in this country or any other, regarding which some such
impression does not exist. (See Layard on the subject.)

About fifty years since, we are told, a strange lady arrived at the
village of Greenhead, and took up her quarters at the inn there. She
told the landlady, in confidence, that she had had a wonderful dream, to
the effect that a large chest of gold lay buried in the vault of
Blenkinsopp Castle, and that she was to be the person to find it. She
stayed several weeks, awaiting the return of the owner of the property
to ask leave to search; but she either got tired of waiting, or could
not obtain permission, and so she went away without accomplishing her
purpose, and the hidden treasure, if there be such a thing there,
remains for some more fortunate person to bring to the light of day.

Tradition accounts for the alleged hiding of the gold in the following
way:--One of the castellans in the middle ages, named Bryan de
Blenkinsopp, familiarly Bryan Blenship, was as avaricious as he was
bold, daring, and lawless. He was once heard to say, when taunted with
being a fusty old bachelor, that he would never marry until he met with
a lady possessed of a chest of gold heavier than ten of his strongest
men could carry into his castle; and fate, it seems, had ordained that
he would keep his word. For, going to the wars abroad, whether to the
Holy Land to fight against the Saracens, or to Hungary to oppose the
Turks, we cannot tell, and staying away several years, he met with a
lady in some far country, who came up to his expectations, courted her,
married her, and brought her home, together with a chest of gold which
it took twelve strong men to lift. Bryan Blenkinsopp was now the richest
man in the North of England; but it soon transpired that his riches had
not brought him happiness, but the reverse. He and his lady quarrelled
continually--a fact which could not long be concealed; and one day when
the unhappy couple had had a more serious difference than usual, Sir
Bryan was heard to utter threats, in reply to his wife's bitter
reproaches, which seemed to indicate that he meant to get rid of her as
soon as he could without any more formality or fuss than if they had
merely been "handfasted," that is, pledged to each other for a year and
a day. The lady muttered something in return, which could not be
distinctly heard by the servants, and so the affair, for the nonce,
seemed to end. But a very short time afterwards--possibly the next
night--the indignant, ill-used lady got the foreign men-servants who had
accompanied her to the castle to take up the precious chest and bury it
deep in some secret place out of her miserly husband's reach, where it
lies to this day. Accounts differ as to what followed. Some say Sir
Bryan disappeared shortly after be discovered his loss; others say the
lady disappeared first; but it is affirmed that they both disappeared in
a mysterious manner, and that neither of them was ever afterwards seen.
It was, moreover, sagely hinted that the lady was "something
uncanny,"--in plain terms, an imp of darkness, sent with her wealth to
ensnare Sir Bryan's greedy soul. At any rate folks were sure that she
was an infidel, for she never went to church, and used on Sundays to
sing hymns to Mahoun, or some other false god, in an unknown tongue in
her own room.
