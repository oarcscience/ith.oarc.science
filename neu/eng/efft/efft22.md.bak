# THE FAIRY FUNERAL  <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)

THE parish church of Lelant is curiously situated amidst hills of blown
sand, near the entrance of the creek of Hayle. The sandy waste around
the church is called the Towen; and this place was long the scene of the
midnight gambols of the Small People. In the adjoining village--or, as
it is called in Cornwall, the "church-town "--lived an old woman who had
been, according to her own statement, a frequent witness to the use made
by the fairies of the Towen. Her husband, also, had seen some
extraordinary scenes on the same spot. From her--to me, oft-repeated
description--I get the following tale:--It was the fishing season; and
Richard had been to St. Ives for some fish. He was returning, laden with
pilchards, on a beautiful moonlight night; and as he ascended the hill
from St. Ives he thought he heard the bell of Lelant church tolling.
Upon a nearer approach he saw lights in the church; and most distinctly
did the bell toll--not with its usual clear sound, but dull and heavy as
if it had been muffled, scarcely awakening any echo. Richard walked
towards the church, and cautiously, but not without lea; approaching one
of the windows, looked in. At first he could not perceive any one
within, nor discover whence the light came by which everything was so
distinctly illuminated. At length he saw, moving along the centre aisle,
a funeral procession. The little people who crowded the aisle, although
they all look very sorrowful, were not dressed in any mourning
garmet--so far from it they wore wreaths of little roses, and carried
branches of the blossoming myrtle. Richard beheld the bier borne between
six--whether men or worn he could not tell--but he saw that the face of
the corpse was that of a beautiful female, smaller than the smallest
child's doll. It was, Richard said, "as if it were a dead seraph,"--so
very lovely did it appear to him. The body was covered with white
flowers, and its hair, like gold threads, was tangled amongst the
blossoms. The body was placed within the altar; and then a large pat of
men, with picks and spades, began to dig a little hole close by the
sacramental table. Their task being completed, others, with great care,
removed the body and placed it in the hole. The entire company crowded
around, eager to catch a parting glimpse of that beautiful corpse ere
yet it was placed in the earth. As was lowered into the ground they
began to tear off the flowers and break their branches of myrtle,
crying: "Our queen is dead! our queen is dead!" At length one of the men
who had dug the grave threw a shovelful of earth upon the body; and the
shriek of the fairy host so alarm Richard, that he involuntarily joined
in it In a moment all the lights were extinguished, and the fairies were
heard flying in great consternation in every direction. Many them
brushed past the terrified man, and, shrieking, pierced him with sharp
instruments. He was compelled to save his life *by the most rapid
flight*.
