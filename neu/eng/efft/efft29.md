# COLMAN GREY.  <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md)

A FARMER, who formerly lived on an estate in our vicinity, was returning
one evening from a distant part of the farm, when, in crossing a
particular field, he saw, to his surprise, sitting on a stone in the
middle of it, a miserable-looking little creature, human in appearance,
though diminutive in size, and apparently starving with cold and hunger.
Pitying its condition, and perhaps aware that it was of elfish origin,
and that good luck would amply repay him for his kind treatment of it,
he took it home, placed it by the warm hearth on a stool, and fed it
with nice milk. The poor bantling soon recovered from the lumpish and
only half-sensible state in which it was found, and, though it never
spoke, became very lively and playful. From the amusement which its
strange tricks excited, it became a general favourite in the family, and
the good folk really felt very sorry when their strange guest quitted
them, which he did in a very unceremonious manner. After the lapse of
three or four days, as the little fellow was gamboling about the farm
kitchen, a shrill voice from the town-place, or farmyard, was heard to
call three times: "Colman Grey!" at which he sprang up, and gaining
voice, cried: "Ho! ho! ho! my daddy is come," flew through the keyhole,
and was never afterwards heard of.
