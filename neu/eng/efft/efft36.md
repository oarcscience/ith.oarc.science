# THE FAIRIES' CALDRON.   <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

IN the vestry of Frensham Church, in Surrey, on the north side of the
chancel, is an extraordinary great kettle or caidron, which the
inhabitants say, by tradition, was brought hither by the fairies, time
out of mind, from Borough-hill about a mile hence. To this place, if any
one went to borrow a yoke of oxen, money, etc., he might have it for a
year or longer, so be kept his word to return it. There is a cave where
some have fancied to hear music. In this Borough-hill is a great stone
lying along of the length of about six feet. They went to this stone and
knocked at it, and declared what they would borrow, and when they would
repay, and a voice would answer when they should come, and that they
should find what they desired to borrow at that stone. This caidron,
with the trivet, was borrowed here after the manner aforesaid, and not
returned according to promise; and though the caidron was afterwards
carried to the stone, it could not be received, and ever since that time
no borrowing there.
