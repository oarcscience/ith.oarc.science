### CHAP. VII.

*Of the area round Stonehenge. The bowing stones. The manner of
sacrificing*.

OF the court round the temple of *Stonehenge*, somewhat is said already,
<span class="margnote">TAB. XXIII.</span> and of the two stones standing
within the *vallum*: and of the two cavities remarkable, which have some
correspondency therewith. I supposed, they were places, where two great
vases of water stood, for the service of the temple, when they perform’d
religious rites here. And I endeavour’d to illustrate it by a coin of
the city *Heliopolis*. 60 cubits is the diameter of *Stonehenge*, 60
more reaches the inner edge of the circular ditch of the court. The
ditch originally was near 30 cubits broad, but thro’ long tract of time,
and the infinity of coaches, horses, *&c*. coming every day to see the
place, ’tis levell’d very much. The intire diameter of the court,
reaching to the outward verge of the ditch, is 4 times 60 cubits, which
is about 410 foot. The five outer circles of the ditch are struck with a
radius of 80, 90, 100, 110, 120 cubits.

Just upon the inner verge of the ditch, at the entrance from the avenue,
lies a very large stone, at present flat on the ground. Mr. *Webb*, p.
57. pretends to give us the measure of it, confounding it with the other
two before-mention’d to be within the *vallum*, to which they have no
relation, no similarity in proportion. This is to favour his notion of
three entrances of the *area*, dependant upon his hypothesis of
equilateral triangles. He there tells us at the letter F, "the parallel
stones on the inside of the trench were four foot broad and three foot
thick; but they lie so broken and ruin’d by time, that their proportion
in height cannot be distinguish’d, much less exactly measur’d." Thus he,
but ’tis *invita Minervâ*; for all three stones, in all appearance, are
as little alter’d from their first size, as any stones in the work. The
two stones within the *vallum* are very small stones, and ever were so.
The one stands; the other leans a little, probably from some idle people
digging about it. This stone at the entrance is a very great one, near
as big as any one of the whole work, and seems too as little alter’d
from its original form: only thrown down perhaps by the like foolish
curiosity of digging near it. Instead of *Webb*'s four foot broad, it's
near seven: but to speak in the Druid measure, four cubits. It is at
present above 20 feet long. If it stood originally, and a little
leaning, it was one of those stones which the *Welsh* call *crwm
lechen*, or bowing-stones. However, Mr. *Webb* must falsify the truth
very much, in making this and the two former any thing alike in
dimension, situation and use. But he does so, much more in the next,
which is doubtless a *crwm leche*, still standing in its original
posture and place in the avenue. ’Tis of much the like dimension as the
other, tho’ not so shapely, and stands in like manner on the left hand,
or south, of the middle line, of the length of the avenue. I surmise,
the Druids consider’d the propriety of making the other a little more
shapely than this, because within the *area*, and nearer the sacred
fabric. There is the distance of 119 feet between them, to speak
properly, 80 cubits. This interval Mr. *Webb* contracts to about 43
foot, and supposes there was another stone to answer it on the right
hand, as also another to answer that on the inside the ditch. And he
supposes the like of those before-mention’d, both within and without the
ditch, at his two fancy’d entrances. But of these, there is *nec vola
nec vestigium*, and I dare say, never was. This stone has a hole in it,
which is observable of like stones, set thus near our like temples: as
we shall see in the progress of this work. The stone is of 24 foot in
circumference, 16 high above ground, 9 broad, 6 thick. The use of it I
can’t certainly tell; but I am inclin’d to think,

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

that as part of the religious worship in old patriarchal times,
consisted in a solemn adoration, or three silent bowings: the first
bowing might be perform’d at this stone, just without the ditch, the
second perhaps at the next stone, just within the ditch. Then they
turn’d by that stone to the left hand, as the manner was, in a
procession round the temple, both the priests and animals for sacrifice.
At those two stones and water-vases, probably there were some washings,
lustrations, or sprinklings with holy water, and other ceremonies, which
I don’t pretend to ascertain. Then upon the entry into the temple,
perhaps they made the third bow, as in presence of the Deity. After
this, in the *court*, we may suppose the priests prepar’d the hecatombs
and customary sacrifices. If that great stone just within the ditch,
always lay, as it does now, flat on the ground, and *in situ*, (which I
am not unwilling to believe) then, I apprehend, it was a table for
dressing the victims. *Ezekiel*, in describing the temple of
*Jerusalem*, speaks of such in the entry, xl. 30, 40, 41, 42, 43.

’Tis just to think, the ancient form of sacrificing here, like that of
the *Romans*, *Greeks* or elder nations, was pretty much the same as
that among the *Jews*, and that as in patriarchal times; and in short,
no other than the original practice of mankind, since the first
institution of sacrifices, at the fall. Therefore we shall subjoin it
from *Homer*'s description, in *Iliad* I. It quadrates extremely well,
in all appearance, with the place and temple before us.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Straightway in haste, a chosen hecatomb  
To God, prepar’d, the well-built altar round,  
They place in order. Then their hands they wash,  
And take the salted meal. Aloud the priest,  
With hands uplifted, for the assembly prays.  
After the prayers, they wav’d the salted meal,  
And then retiring slay the animals.  
The skins being stript, they cut off both the thighs,  
And cover them with cawl; first offer’d crude.  
The priest then burns a part on plates, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[†](#fn_0.md) thereon red wine,  
Libation pour’d. The ministring young men  
Stand by him, with their five-fold spits in hand.  
But when the thighs are burnt, out of the rest  
Entrails and flesh, harslets and stakes they make,  
Upon the spits transfixt. Then roasted well  
They set all forth. After the duty done;  
A feast they next prepare. Plenty of food  
Distributed around, chearful repast.  
Banquet being o’re, the youths huge goblets crown,  
And fill to all in cups. Then sacred hymns  
Sung to the Deity, conclude the day.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[34:†](str09.htm#fr_0.md) In another place he adds,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These are most
ancient rites, symbolical of the purity of the sacrifice of the
*Messiah*, pointed at by, and deriv’d from the *Mosaic* dispensation,
where every thing of sacred purpose was to be perfect.

Thus much is sufficient to give the reader an idea of the ancient manner
of sacrificing, such, no doubt as was practis’d at this very place
entirely the *Hebrew* rite. I suppose only the priests and chief
personages came within the *area*, who made the procession with the
sacrifices along the avenue. The multitude kept without, on foot or in
their chariots.
