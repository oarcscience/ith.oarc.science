<p>Nought loves another as itself<br> Nor venerates another so,<br> Nor is it possible to Thought<br> A greater than itself to know:</p>  
<p>And Father, how can I love you,<br> Or any of my brothers more?<br> I love you like the little bird<br> That picks up crumbs around the door.</p>  
<p>The Priest sat by and heard the child,<br> In trembling zeal he siez&#8217;d his hair:<br> He led him by his little coat:<br> And all admir&#8217;d the Priestly care.</p>  
<p>And standing on the altar high,<br> Lo what a fiend is here! said he:<br> One who sets reason up for judge<br> Of our most holy Mystery.</p>  
<p>The weeping child could not be heard,<br> The weeping parents wept in vain:<br> They strip&#8217;d him to his little shirt,<br> And bound him in an iron chain.</p>  
<p>And burn&#8217;d him in a holy place,<br> Where many had been burn&#8217;d before:<br> The weeping parents wept in vain.<br> Are such things done on Albions shore.</p>
