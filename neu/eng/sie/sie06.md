### The Lamb

  Little Lamb who made thee  
  Dost thou know who made thee  
Gave thee life & bid thee feed,  
By the stream & o’er the mead;  
Gave thee clothing of delight,  
Softest clothing wooly bright;  
Gave thee such a tender voice,  
Making all the vales rejoice:  
  Little Lamb who made thee  
  Dost thou know who made thee

  Little Lamb I'll tell thee,  
  Little Lamb Ill tell thee;  
He is called by thy name,  
For he calls himself a Lamb:  
He is meek & he is mild,  
He became a little child:  
I a child & thou a lamb,  
We are called by his name.  
  Little Lamb God bless thee,  
  Little Lamb God bless thee.
