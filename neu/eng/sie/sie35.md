### My Pretty ROSE TREE

A flower was offerd to me:  
Such a flower as May never bore.  
But I said I've a Pretty Rose-tree,  
And I passed the sweet flower o’er.

Then I went to my Pretty Rose-tree:  
To tend her by day and by night.  
But my Rose turnd away with jealousy:  
And her thorns were my only delight.

### AH! SUN-FLOWER

Ah Sun-flower! weary of time,  
Who countest the steps of the Sun:  
Seeking after that sweet golden clime,  
Where the travellers journey is done.

Where the Youth pined away with desire,  
And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow:  
Arise from their graves and aspire,  
Where my Sun-flower wishes to go.

### THE LILLY

The modest Rose puts forth a thorn:  
The humble Sheep, a threatning horn:  
While the Lilly white, shall in Love delight,  
Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.
