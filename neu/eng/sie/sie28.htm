<p>In futurity<br> I prophetic see,<br> That the earth from sleep,<br> (Grave the sentence deep)</p>  
<p>Shall arise and seek<br> For her maker meek:<br> And the desart wild<br> Become a garden mild.</p>  
<p>In the southern clime,<br> Where the summers prime,<br> Never fades away;<br> Lovely Lyca lay.</p>  
<p>Seven summers old<br> Lovely Lyca told,<br> She had wanderd long,<br> Hearing wild birds song.</p>  
<p>Sweet sleep come to me<br> Underneath this tree;<br> Do father, mother weep,&#8212;<br> "Where can Lyca sleep".</p>  
<p>Lost in desart wild<br> Is your little child.<br> How can Lyca sleep,<br> If her mother weep.</p>  
<p>If her heart does ake,<br> Then let Lyca wake;<br> If my mother sleep,<br> Lyca shall not weep.</p>  
<p>Frowning frowning night,<br> O&#8217;er this desart bright,<br> Let thy moon arise,<br> While I close my eyes.</p>  
<p>Sleeping Lyca lay;<br> While the beasts of prey,<br> Come from caverns deep,<br> View&#8217;d the maid asleep</p>  
<p>The kingly lion stood<br> And the virgin view&#8217;d,<br> Then he gambold round<br> O&#8217;er the hallowd ground:</p>

<p>Leopards, tygers play,<br> Round her as she lay;<br> While the lion old,<br> Bow&#8217;d his mane of gold,</p>  
<p>And her bosom lick,<br> And upon her neck,</p>  
<p>From his eyes of flame,<br> Ruby tears there came;</p>  
<p>While the lioness<br> Loos&#8217;d her slender dress,<br> And naked they convey&#8217;d<br> To caves the sleeping maid.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">The Little Girl Found</h3>  
<p>All the night in woe,<br> Lyca's parents go:<br> Over vallies deep,<br> While the desarts weep.</p>  
<p>Tired and woe-begone,<br> Hoarse with making moan:<br> Arm in arm seven days,<br> They trac&#8217;d the desart ways.</p>  
<p>Seven nights they sleep,<br> Among shadows deep:<br> And dream they see their child<br> Starv&#8217;d in desart wild.</p>  
<p>Pale thro&#8217; pathless ways<br> The fancied image strays,</p>  
<p align="right"><i>Famish&#8217;d</i><i></i></p>

<IMG SRC="img/36.jpg"></p>  
<p>Famish&#8217;d, weeping, weak<br> With hollow piteous shriek</p>  
<p>Rising from unrest,<br> The trembling woman prest,<br> With feet of weary woe;<br> She could no further go.</p>  
<p>In his arms he bore,<br> Her arm&#8217;d with sorrow sore:<br> Till before their way,<br> A couching lion lay.</p>  
<p>Turning back was vain,<br> Soon his heavy mane,<br> Bore them to the ground;<br> Then he stalk&#8217;d around.</p>  
<p>Smelling to his prey,<br> But their fears allay,<br> When he licks their hands:<br> And silent by them stands.</p>  
<p>They look upon his eyes<br> Fill&#8217;d with deep surprise:<br> And wondering behold,<br> A spirit arm&#8217;d in gold.</p>  
<p>On his head a crown<br> On his shoulders down,<br> Flow&#8217;d his golden hair.<br> Gone was all their care.</p>  
<p>Follow me he said,<br> Weep not for the maid:<br> In my palace deep,<br> Lyca lies asleep.</p>  
<p>Then they followed,<br> Where the vision led:<br> And saw their sleeping child,<br> Among tygers wild.</p>  
<p>To this day they dwell<br> In a lonely dell<br> Nor fear the wolvish howl,<br> Nor the lions growl.</p>
