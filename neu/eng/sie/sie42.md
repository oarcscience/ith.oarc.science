### A Little BOY Lost

Nought loves another as itself  
Nor venerates another so,  
Nor is it possible to Thought  
A greater than itself to know:

And Father, how can I love you,  
Or any of my brothers more?  
I love you like the little bird  
That picks up crumbs around the door.

The Priest sat by and heard the child,  
In trembling zeal he siez’d his hair:  
He led him by his little coat:  
And all admir’d the Priestly care.

And standing on the altar high,  
Lo what a fiend is here! said he:  
One who sets reason up for judge  
Of our most holy Mystery.

The weeping child could not be heard,  
The weeping parents wept in vain:  
They strip’d him to his little shirt,  
And bound him in an iron chain.

And burn’d him in a holy place,  
Where many had been burn’d before:  
The weeping parents wept in vain.  
Are such things done on Albions shore.
