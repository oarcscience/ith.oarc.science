### HOLY THURSDAY

Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean  
The children walking two & two in red & blue & green  
Grey headed beadles walkd before with wands as white as snow  
Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow

O what a multitude they seemd these flowers of London town  
Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own  
The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs  
Thousands of little boys & girls raising their innocent hands

Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song  
Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among  
Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor  
Then cherish pity; lest you drive an angel from your door
