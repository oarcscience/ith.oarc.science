# CHAPTER 11

Profiting by a lesson learned from Will o' th' Green, Robin stained his
face and bade Stuteley do the same ere starting to the Royal tourney.

The morning was overcast and doubtful when the two lads set forth. They
had put on foresters' clothes of green cloth, with long tunics and green
trunk hose. Their hands and faces were brown as walnut juice could make
them; and whilst Robin carried only his best longbow and a good quiver
of arrows, young Will had loaded himself with quarterstaff, axe, and
pike, all very difficult to carry.

Robin bade him leave one or the other of these weapons, and reluctantly
the pike was returned to Warrenton. Then merrily they started away
through the forest, and came at noon to that glade where Robin had first
met Will o' th' Green. Even while Robin wondered whether Will or his men
might again demand toll of him, Master Will himself suddenly appeared,
and without a word placed his bow across their path.

"Greetings to you, Will," said Robin, blithely. "Is it toll of us that
you desire?"

"Are you dumb, friend?" added Stuteley, impudently, as the outlaw made
no immediate reply.

Will smiled then. "So old Warrenton has persuaded you to seek the
Prince's gold, youngling?" said he, at last. Without waiting an answer,
he stepped back and withdrew his bow. "Pass, then, Locksley, and good
fortune attend you," he went on. "We may meet again ere the day be done;
but it is not sure--"

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

"You will not try for the purse, Will?" cried Robin, as if surprised.

"I have no use for it," answered Will, with some egotism. "Nay, fear
not, our third trial is yet to come. I did but stay you to speak of your
cousin--" He paused, and glanced towards Stuteley.

"I am deaf and dumb as you were, friend, a minute agone," spoke the
little esquire.

"Your cousin, Geoffrey of Montfichet, has gone to France," continued
Will, speaking freely so soon as Robin had nodded in confirmation of
Stuteley's discretion. "Like as not, Master Geoffrey has not talked with
you as to his business with us in this greenwood?"

"I know nothing beyond that we did bind my cousin's armor about with red
ribbon," replied Robin, uneasily. He remembered the clerk's warning, and
a presentiment of coming evil pricked him. "But I am right glad that
Geoffrey has encountered no danger, and has given up his schemes with
you."

"I did not say that he had done that, Locksley," spoke Will, in his
gruff way. "Nor do I see why you should fear danger for him when he is
in my company."

"I meant not that, Will, believe me," said Robin, hastily. "But there
are two amongst your band who have little love for my cousin, and are
jealous also of you--" And he told him of his adventure in the early
part of the day when they last had met.

Will listened with a frown. "So they winged you, youngling, and yet for
all that you won the Sheriff's arrow? Give me now some token whereby I
may know which of my men are traitors."

"I should only know their voices, Will," said Robin, regretfully.

The outlaw shrugged. "It matters not, after all," he remarked, turning
to leave them. "Go your ways, Locksley, and win the purse."

"Is there no toll?" enquired Robin, smiling again. "Am I truly free of
Sherwood, Will?"

"'Twould seem so, Locksley," said the outlaw, briefly. Then, without
further ado, he strode away from him.

They watched his lithe form disappear.

"'Tis sure that our disguise is none too good," sighed Robin, pondering
upon the ready way in which the outlaw had recognized him.

Soon afterward rain fell and a heavy storm raged amongst the trees.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The two youths crept into the hollow of one of
the larger oaks to shelter themselves. Whilst waiting there they heard
the noise of an approaching cavalcade. It was a body of archers coming
from Lincoln to compete for the purse of gold.

They cantered past the tree wherein Robin and Stuteley lay hidden, and
took no heed of the drenching rain. All were merry with wine and very
confident that one amongst them would surely win the prize. The only
question was, Which one?

"These Nottingham clods!" cried one, scornfully; "I'll dare swear that
many of them have already promised the prize to their maids! Nottingham
'gainst Lincoln--'tis possible that they may stand to us for a round.
But after that!"

"We will spend the money in Nottingham town," shouted another of the
trotting bowmen. "For sure the Prince himself could do no handsomer
thing. A piece I'll toss to the heralds, and another to you, Staveley,
for you are a covetous worm--"

The rest of his speech was lost through the one addressed turning
violently upon him and thrusting at him with his pike, thus tumbling him
into the mire. Stuteley laughed outright at this, and for a moment
startled the rest of this worshipful company.

Robin, rather vexed at his esquire's want of caution, came with him from
out of the hollow of the tree. The Lincolnshire men halted, and Robin
asked for a lift to the field where already the tourney was being
commenced.

"Are you going to the Sherwood tourney, and with a bow?" asked one of
the archers, loftily. "What will you shoot there, gipsy boy? There are
no targets such as your shafts might reach. But 'tis true that you may
learn something of the game, if you should go."

"I'll lay a crown wager with you, friends," said Stuteley, vexed to hear
Robin called "gipsy," "that my master's shaft will fly more near the
centre of the mark than will any one of yours. So now."

"A crown piece, gipsy! Why, that means twenty crowns for you to find,"
laughed another of the men, loudly.

"Twenty crowns; why, he has not twenty pence," said another.

"My man has laid the wager and I will stand to it," said Robin, quietly,
"though I do not like such boasting, I promise you. Twenty

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

crowns to twenty crowns--who will hold the stakes? Here is my purse in
warrant of my words."

"Why, Master, I am surely the very man to hold your purse!" called out
the lately fallen champion, readily. "Ask any of them here and (if they
have love of truth in them) they will say that Much the Miller is a man
of men for honesty, sobriety, and the like! 'Tis known throughout
Lincoln that never have I given short measure in all my life. Hand me
the purse and be easy."

"Show me your crown, friend," said Robin, eyeing him.

"Now, stirrup me but I have given my last piece to a poor beggar whom we
did meet in the wood."

"Then I will hold my purse myself, Master Much," cried Robin, putting it
quickly back into his bosom. "But have no fear; if you can beat me, I'll
add my crown to the Prince's moneybag. We will meet you here, friends,"
he continued. "beside this very tree, at noon tomorrow, if I should win.
If not, I'll yield this purse to the miller ere I leave the tourney, and
he shall share it round. Is it agreed?"

"I do think that you should pay for your travelling, gipsy, since you
are so rich," grunted the first archer. "Here's half my saddle: I'll
only ask a silver penny for a seat on it."

"I'll take you for ought, gipsy," shouted Much, who really was very
tipsy. "You've spoken fair; and I like you! Come, jump up behind me, and
hold tight. This horse is one of most wayward character."

"Hurry, then," said the leader. "Whilst we chatter here the tourney will
be done; and we shall happen on it just as Hubert takes the prize.
Forward, friends; quick march!"

They rattled off at a smart pace. Robin mounted behind the good-natured
Much, and Stuteley upon the captain's horse. The miller told Robin
confidentially a full score of times that he, Much, was bound to win the
archery contest, being admittedly the first bowman in the world.

"Harkee, gipsy," called he at length, over the point of his shoulder to
patient Robin behind him, "I'll not take your crown, I swear it! I like
you, and I would not rob your sweetheart of a penny piece. Buy ribbons
for her, then, with the crown I give you."

Robin expressed his thanks very cordially. This fellow seemed an

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

honest-hearted rogue; and 'twas mainly to his furious urging of his
steed that they arrived in time for the great event.

As it was, all the jousting was done, and most of the nobles had already
gone away. The Sheriff was fussily preparing himself to escort the
Prince to the castle when the horns blew announcing the arrival of the
Lincolnshire bowmen.

They had pushed their way clumsily through the array of tents, and now
blundered into the lists through the gate. Robin was glad indeed of his
stained face and semi-disguise, not being over proud of his companions.
He gave Will Stuteley a signal to detach himself from them, and come to
his side. The two youths then hastened to the archers' stand.

There had been three deaths already as a result of the joustings; and
six others were seriously injured; yet the Prince looked far from being
satisfied, and his glance strayed forever to the gate.

When the Lincoln men had come noisily trooping in, his face had lit up
and his hand had made a half-movement to find the jewelled hilt of his
sword. Master Carfax, too, had started to his feet in evident concern.

When the heralds announced these newcomers, visible disappointment
showed on the faces of the Prince and his followers. Clearly they were
eagerly expecting the appearance of other folk; but, quickly recovering
himself, John refound all the old elegance of his manners. He
courteously acknowledged the rough greeting of the archers, and sat back
smilingly in his box.

Master Monceux gave the signal for the archery contest to be begun; and
Robin soon saw that the archers against him were men very different from
those who had been at Nottingham Fair.

When it came to the turn of the Prince's own bowman, Hubert of
Normandy--a man slim, conceited, and overdressed, but nevertheless a
very splendid archer--the first shaft flew so cleanly and so swift that
it pierced the very middle of the target and stuck out on the other side
full half its length.

Robin had to shoot immediately after him, and waited a few moments
whilst the markers were tugging at the Norman's arrow. A sudden
inspiration flashed across the lad's mind; and, advancing a step, he
bade them desist. They wonderingly fell back, leaving Hubert's arrow
fixed spitefully in the target.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

One of the heralds cried out that this archer had not yet given in his
name, but even as he spoke, Robin's arrow flew hissing from his bow. A
silence fell upon the onlookers, and even the smiling Prince leaned
forward in his box. Then a great shout went up of amazement and
incredulity. The markers and heralds thronged about the target and hid
it from the general view until they were impatiently pulled away by some
of the Prince's bodyguard.

A marvel was seen then by all eyes--Robin's arrow standing stiffly out
from the centre of the target, with Hubert's wand split down on either
side of it flush to the very face of the mark!

Robin himself could scarcely credit his own success. He had done the
thing before, with Warrenton, once out of a dozen times: and he had
essayed it now more out of bravado than aught else.

"'Twas a feat worthy of Hubert himself," said the Sheriff,
bombastically, to the Prince. He had not recognized Robin.

"I have seen Hubert perform just such a trick on many occasions, sir,"
said Carfax. "This fellow has done no uncommon thing, believe me," he
went on. "And after all, he has not bettered Hubert's shot."

"That is true," said the Prince, as if thoughtfully. His face showed
smiling again. "Let the contest go on: and Hubert shall shoot again with
this young trickster.

"The heralds say that he has not given in his name, Sire," said one of
the courtiers.

"If that is so, his shooting is of no avail, be it never so good," cried
Carfax, triumphantly. "Tell them that the archer is disqualified, my
lord," he continued, addressing the Sheriff; "and bid them discover who
he may be."

Carfax turned again to the Prince, and began a whispered conversation
with him. The Prince listened, nodding his head in approval.

"Well, Monceux, what do they say?" he asked the Sheriff, languidly, as
the other returned.

"It seems, Sire, that the archer is one who came in with a company of
Lincoln bowmen. No one knows him hereabout. I have said that he is
disqualified, and now the others will shoot again. But Hubert has now
the purse, for sure."

"In sooth I do think so," answered the Prince, laughing rather

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

conceitedly. "But Monceux, bid this lad to me forthwith. I would speak
with him."

The Sheriff went about the task; but Robin had disappeared; for
suddenly, amidst the throng, his eyes had encountered those strange
grey-blue ones of Mistress Fitzwalter.

She was sitting alone in a little box nearby the targets. Robin had
walked down the lists to see for himself that his shaft had split the
Norman's fairly, and in turning away to find Stuteley he had become
aware of her shrewd, piercing gaze. She allowed her eyes to rest fully
on young Fitzooth's ardent glance for the briefest moment. Then she
looked away unconcernedly.

But Robin, venturing all, drew nigh. He came to the edge of her box, and
began to speak. He had gone so far as "Give you good morrow, lady," when
his eyes perceived the Sheriff's little golden arrow fastening her
cloak. His mouth became dry at that and his words went back in his
throat.

The girl, aware of his confusion, brought her gaze back upon him. She
smiled.

"Is it indeed my young champion?" asked she, rather doubtfully at first,
in her low, soft tones. "Is it you who have beaten the Prince's best
archer, Robin o' the' Hood?"

Her eyes were wells of innocent fun. The way in which she lingered over
the last syllables brought Robin still deeper into the deep waters.

"It is your servant, madame," was all that he could find to say.

"You see then that I wear your gift, Robin," she said, trying to make
him at ease. "I have not forgotten--"

"Nor I--I shall *never* forget," cried he, impulsively. "Your eyes are
always in my memory: they are beautiful as stars," said he, fervently.

"Oh, a gallant Locksley! But there, take my colors, since you will be my
knight." She untied a ribbon from her hair, and gave it into his
outstretched palm. "And now, farewell; take the Prince's prize, and
spend the pennies worthily. Buy your sweetheart some ribbons, but keep
that which I have given you."

She tossed her curls again as she added the last word. Robin was
beginning a vehement protestation that he had no sweetheart when
Stuteley's voice broke in upon him.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

"Master, they have disqualified you, and given the prize to Hubert. 'Tis
a vile injustice, and I have raised my voice furiously. So, alas! has
Master Much the Miller; he is a very worthy gentleman."

"What do you say?" asked Mistress Fitzwalter, in amazement.

"It is even so, lady, that my lord the Sheriff has ruled my master out
of the court, for the reason that he did not give in his name before
drawing his bow!" cried Stuteley. "A wicked conspiracy it is, and
monstrous unjust! 'Tis thus that these prizes are given; the game's
arranged beforehand. Ah, but I know how these Nottingham folk do plot:
thrice now have I found them false and treacherous."

When Stuteley had begun there were many who were ready to side with him,
but his unlucky conclusion turned these possible friends into enemies.
Even Mistress Fitzwalter drew back for an instant.

"Be silent, Will," said Robin, vexed at once. "It is enough to be
juggled out of this prize without your making it worse. I'll go claim it
from Monceux and he shall argue it with me."

"The Prince is asking for you, friend," said Carfax, suddenly appearing.
He touched Robin on the shoulder.

As he turned to depart, his gimlet eyes saw how the girl shrank away
from them into her box. He looked swiftly at her; then at Robin again.
"His Highness graciously condescended to enquire your name and rank,"
said he, pausing.

"Will he give the purse to me, then?" asked Robin, surprised.

"Nay, that has already been won by Master Hubert," answered Carfax, as
if amused at the question. "You cannot win a prize every day,
Master--Locksley."

He spoke at a shrewd guess, and saw that his shaft had hit the mark.
Mistress Fitzwalter's interest in Robin had given him the clue.

"I'll not go to the Prince," said Robin, wrathfully. "Tell him, Master
Fetch-and-Take, that I have won this prize in all fairness; and I will
shoot with Hubert again, if he needs another beating."

"You'll cool your heels in the stocks, Locksley," said Carfax,
viciously: "so much is evident. The Sheriff has a quarrel with you
already, and 'tis well that you are here to answer Master Ford's
complaint. The Prince will send for you in style, since you will not go
kindly to him. Bide but a few minutes. I'll not keep you waiting!"

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

He strode off, in heat, followed by Stuteley's scornful gibings.

Robin became aware that the people were eyeing them both with
none-too-friendly glances. He felt that he and Will Stuteley were in a
difficult position. Escape seemed to be out of the question.

"Jump over the ledge of my box, Robin," whispered a sudden small voice,
"and so make your way through the door at the back of it. Hasten!"

Gratefully Robin did as she bade him; and Stuteley, without waiting for
invitation, followed. Mistress Fitzwalter instantly opened the door for
them. "Hurry, I pray you," cried she; "I see them coming for you both.
The Prince has sent his pikemen--"

Robin pushed Will out before him; and, turning, caught her little hand
in his.

"Thanks, thanks," he muttered, hurriedly, and strove to kiss her
fingers.

Laughing and blushing, she snatched them away.

"Go," she cried, in agitated voice, "and stay not until you reach
Locksley. We may meet again-to talk of thanks," she added, seeing that
he still hesitated.

"Give me at least your name," panted poor Robin, at the door; "not that
I shall ever forget you."

"I am called Marian," answered she, closing the door ruthlessly upon
him--"Marian Fitzwalter . . . . Go now, I implore you, and may good
fortune be with you always."
