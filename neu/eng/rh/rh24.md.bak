# CHAPTER 23

Master Carfax had by this time arrived in Nottingham, all eager to marry
his cold bride. He found, however, that this was a happiness not yet to
be, for matters were in a grievous state in the Sheriff's household.

My lord of Hereford was very wroth with them all, and had sent Monceux
back to his native city with much to think upon. The Bishop had taken
the opportunity of laying formal complaint at Court before the King; and
his Majesty had told Master Monceux that when he went back to Nottingham
it must be to keep the Royal forest free of all evildoers. Otherwise a
new Sheriff would be found for Nottingham, and that right soon.

Henry, the King, was near to his own end, and had become very irritable
in consequence of his illness. His sons tried his scanty patience sorely
with their waywardness and their ingratitude. So Monceux had none too
pleasant a reception at Court, and returned therefrom with a heavy
heart.

Simeon Carfax was therefore despatched into Sherwood to find the tinker,
so that Middle might be whipped and put into the stocks for having
failed, also Carfax was to secure Robin and the ringleaders at all
hazard. To this end Master Simeon was given command of the Sheriff's own
men-at-arms, and a great body of citizens from the town wards, each man
having the promise of a large reward and freedom thenceforth from all
taxes.

The news soon came to Robin, and he and his men retired at once into the
innermost parts of Barnesdale, and secured their caves by

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

covering the mouths of them with barricades artfully concealed behind
green boughs and the like.

So Carfax and his fellows searched without avail for near three weeks,
only occasionally having evidence of the greenwood men by finding the
feet and antlers of the King's deer lying here and there in the forest.
The Sheriff's men laid many traps for Robin, but all in vain.

Stuteley, being of venturesome mind, must needs attempt all manner of
tricks upon this motley company of soldiers. He would dig a pit with
Little John and Much, and hide it up with branches and earth, so that
Master Carfax might stray into it and haply break his neck.

At last Carfax bethought him of a good plot. He had nigh fallen into one
of Will Stuteley's pits, but suddenly stayed his men from demolishing
it. He planned instead to pretend to be trapped in the pit that very
night; and, having hidden his fellows all round about, he walked out
boldly at dusk with but three of them, and fell a-talking loudly of his
schemes for capturing Robin Hood.

He walked carelessly up to the hidden pit and with great outcry fell
into it, the others with him running off then as if in deadly alarm.
Then Master Carfax began a loud lament, and made such a noise that
Stuteley must hear it.

Young Will came bounding joyfully to the pit's edge, and, spying Carfax
therein, fell into an ecstasy of delight. He railed at Simeon very
pleasantly, and made merry at the other's supposed mishap. But presently
Carfax blew his horn, and shortly Stuteley found the position reversed.
After a desperate struggle he was overpowered and carried off, although
not without being seen by another of Robin's men. This man brought Robin
the bad news within an hour of Will Stuteley's capture.

The greenwood men flung prudence to the winds and sallied forth. They
pursued and came up with the rear guard of the enemy, and a terrible
battle was fought. Thirteen of Robin's brave fellows were wounded, five
of them so grievously as to die soon afterward of their wounds, and as
many of the Nottingham soldiery also were slain.

Carfax returned to Nottingham, however--this time in some triumph. His
men had beaten back the outlaws, and he had secured the lieutenant of
the band, a "desperate villain, next to Robin Hood himself in deeds of
violence and disorder."

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

So all agreed; and by dint and hard swearing soon wove a noose to fit
Will Stuteley's thin neck. Monceux, in grave satisfaction, ordered that
their prisoner should be hanged and quartered, within a week, in the
streets of Nottingham, as a warning and example to all wrongdoers.

The Sheriff gave a feast to all the soldiery and doubled the reward upon
Robin's head. Until *he* was caught Monceux: could but remain uneasy,
for Henry of England was a man of his word.

Robin was sorely grieved at the loss of Stuteley, and swore that he
would save his little squire or die. He went, therefore, to Gamewell to
discover from Marian precisely how they had arranged for the hanging of
Stuteley, for she was able to go into Nottingham in her page's dress.

Marian had learned it all. "First, he will be tortured to tell the
secret of your hiding place, dear heart," she told Robin, in bated
breath. "Then he will suffer the full penalty, and will be hanged from a
gallows with three other poor wretches. Last of all he is to be
quartered, and his body flung to the people."

She burst into weeping, and sobbed so grievously that Robin was hard put
to it to keep back his own tears. "Did you learn who these others might
be?" he asked her, to change her thoughts and to satisfy himself that no
other friend was with little Will.

"They are the three sons of a poor widow, who lives in the forest. They
found the body of one of the deer, and, being very hungry, were carrying
it from the forest to their little home. Someone, passing by, accused
them of having first killed it, and this quarrel came to the Sheriff's
ears. Master Carfax then affected to recognize them as being three
greenwood men; and they have been tried summarily and found guilty, and
will be hanged together with Will."

"I swear that this shall not be," cried Robin, in heat, "since no doubt
I am to blame for leaving the slain deer in their way."

"It was, I believe, the very stag that I did kill," said Marian, in a
troubled voice. "They have been in prison for near a month; and the
beast was found outside part of the woods. Shall I not go and give
myself up in their place? Since I have had this dreadful guilty thought
in my mind I have known no moment's peace; but, coward-like, I do not
dare to be honest with myself."

"Be of good courage, dear maid," said Robin. "We have killed many

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

of the King's deer since the day I first did meet with Master Gilbert of
Blois. For we are hungry every day, prithee, and the beasts are many.
Also in this season they are very wild and ferocious--'tis like this one
was killed in a battle royal between itself and another stag. But to
make all sure, we will rescue the widow's three sons with my Stuteley
from the Sheriff's foul clutches."

"Go not into danger, dear heart, for my sake," Marian pleaded, and she
held him close to her as though she never would let him depart again.

\*        \*        \*

Robin went back to his men, and they made their plans. Little John was
given the second place of command, and it was agreed that upon the
morning on which Stuteley and the others were to be hanged the greenwood
men should risk all by marching into Nottingham to the rescue.

The dawn of this eventful morning broke bright and sunny. Robin was
clothed in a gay scarlet dress and his men wore their mantles of
Lincoln-green cloth. They were armed with broadswords, and each carried
a full quiver of new arrows, fashioned for them during the past winter
by the cunning hands of Warrenton.

They marched boldly towards Nottingham, leaving Allan-a-Dale with his
little dame and six of the outlaws to keep house for them, as it were.
When they were within a mile of Nottingham gates, Robin called a halt,
and said: "I hold it good, comrades, that we stay here in hiding, and
send forth someone to hear the news. There comes upon the road a
palmer--see you him nearby the gates? Who will go forth and engage him
in talk?"

"I will," said Midge, at once; "for I am used to deal with holy men."

So Midge went out from them, whilst they all hid themselves and waited.
When he was close to the palmer, Midge said, amiably: "I pray you, old
palmer, tell me if you know where and when these robbers are to die?
Doubtless you have passed the very spot?"

"That have I, indeed," answered the palmer, sadly, "and 'tis a sorry
sight to see. By the Sheriff's castle, out upon the roadway, they have
built an angled gallows tree to bear the four of them at once. They are

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

to die at noon, after the torturing is done. I cannot bear the sight;
and so have turned my back upon it."

The palmer spoke in a muffled voice; and as his hood had been pulled
well over his head, Midge could not see what manner of man he might
exactly be. He carried his long stick with its little cross at the top;
and had sandalled feet, like any monk. Midge noticed idly how small his
feet were for a man of his size, but gave no second thought to the
matter.

"Who will shrive these poor fellows, then, if you have turned your back
upon them?" asked Midge, reproachfully. This seemed to present itself as
a new idea to the palmer.

"Do you think, friend," he inquired, in a troubled way, "that I should
undertake the office?"

"By Saint Peter and Saint Mary, I do indeed," cried Midge, roundly.
"Would you leave them to the empty prayers which the Sheriff's chaplain
will pour coldly over them? Nay, in sooth, if your heart be turned to
sympathy, surely you are the man to administer this last consolation to
these poor fellows."

"If it might be permitted I would dearly love to shrive them," said the
palmer, still hesitating. "But I am only a poor palmer."

"Keep close to me," Midge told him, valiantly, "and you shall shrive
these good fellows an it become necessary. That I promise you."

He returned to Robin and told him that the execution had been fixed to
take place outside Nottingham Castle at noon. "We must hasten then,"
said Robin. "Go you first, Little John; and we will tread close upon
your heels."

Little John swam the moat, and sprang upon the warder of the city gates
suddenly, whilst he was craning his neck to get a view of the Sheriff's
procession of death. The big outlaw seized his victim from behind, and
clapped his great hand over his mouth. Very soon the warder was prisoner
in the round tower by the gate; and Little John had slipped himself into
his uniform.

Little John then lowered the bridge quietly, and passed the rest of them
into Nottingham. Midge and the palmer came last of all. "Now spread
yourselves about into groups of twos and threes," said Robin, "and have
your swords ready when you hear my horn. Little John,

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

prithee draw the bridge again, so that none may suspect us; but leave
the winch loose, for we may have to use it hastily. Go you first, and
Heaven speed thee."

Will Stuteley at length came out of the castle surrounded by the
Sheriff's guards; and behind him walked dejectedly the widow's three
sons. Poor Will looked ghastly pale, and marks of the torturings showed
upon his skin. His face was drawn and lined with anguish.

Monceux was there, dressed out in his best; and was blowing out his fat
cheeks in vast self-importance. Beside the Sheriff was Master Carfax,
lean-faced as ever. They were mounted on white horses; and behind them
were two score of archers and pikemen.

Stuteley, seeing that no help appeared at hand, asked, in a weak voice,
that he might have words with the Sheriff.

Monceux went up to him and bade him speak out.

Stuteley said, in a sad tone: "Sheriff, seeing that I must die today,
grant me this one boon, that I may not be hanged upon a gallows tree,
but rather that I die with my sword in my hand, fighting you and all
your men to the last."

The Sheriff laughed coarsely: "Not so, my man; you shall die instead a
shameful death, and after you your master, Robin Hood, that false
butcher, so soon as I have him fast."

"That you will never do," answered Stuteley, with prophecy, in his weak
voice. "But unbind my hands, Sheriff, for your soul's sake, and let me
meet my end valiantly."

"To the gallows with him!" roared Monceux, giving the sign to the
executioner, and Stuteley was hustled into the rude cart which was to
bear him under the gallows until his neck had been leashed. Then it
would be drawn roughly away and the unhappy man would swing out over the
tail of it into another world.

Two fellows had great knives with them ready to cut him down, and
quarter his body whilst life was in it, as the cruel sentence had
ordained.

"Let me, at the least, shrive this man's soul ere it be hurled into
eternity," said the palmer, stepping toward.

Monceux's face grew black with rage; and yet he scarcely liked to
refuse, for fear it should injure him too much in the eyes of the
people. "Perform the duty quickly then, Sir Priest," he snarled; and
then rode

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

back to Carfax. "Watch the palmer narrowly," he told him, "and do you
secure him afterwards. Methinks he is some ally of these rascal outlaws;
and, in any case, we shall do no harm in questioning him."

The palmer had hardly begun to string his beads when Little John
commenced to elbow a path for himself through the crowd. He roughly
thrust the soldiers aside as if they had been so many children, and came
up to the edge of the cart. "I pray you, Will, take leave of your true
friend here before you die," cried Little John.

The palmer had fallen back at his approach; and stood in some hesitancy.
In a moment Monceux saw what happened. "Seize that man!" he shouted to
his pikemen. "He is that villain who did rob us of our gold plate, who
nearly slew Roger, our cook. He is of the band--seize him; and he too
shall hang!"

"Not so fast, gossip," Little John answered, with an ugly look; "I must
needs borrow my friend of you for a while."

He had cut Stuteley's bands with two quick strokes of his dagger, and
having wrenched a pike from out of one of the soldiers' hands, flung it
to little Will. "Now, by my freedom, here's your prayer answered,
comrade," cried Little John. "I have found you a weapon--do your best
with it!"

The soldiers had recovered from their temporary surprise and flung
themselves upon the prisoner and his would-be rescuer. Robin, from the
back of the Sheriff's bowmen, sounded his horn, and instantly all became
confusion and riot. In the mêlée the palmer sought to slip away
unnoticed, but was detected by the keen eyes of Carfax. Master Simeon
rode round with six of his fellows and caused them to seize the holy
man, and bind him fast with leathern thongs.

But this small success was more than outweighed by the reverse suffered
by Monceux and his men. Taken in assault at the rear, they had no chance
with the greenwood men. Robin himself had released the widow's three
sons, and they had not been slow in arming themselves. Some of those in
the crowd, having secret sympathy with the outlaws and hating the
Sheriff heartily for many small injustices, also flung themselves into
the fray.

The greenwood men cleared the green square before the Sheriff's home by
repeated rushes and desperate chargings. Broken heads and

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

cut knees there were in plenty; and lucky the man who escaped with so
little as these. Carfax won a place of safety for Master Monceux, and
fell back slowly, with him the unwilling palmer, until shelter of the
castle gates had been attained. Then the soldiers and pikemen grew very
valiant, and shot out clouds of arrows, through the loopholes in the
castle towers, upon townsmen and rioters alike.

Half a score of men were killed ere this day was ended, amongst them
being that very apprentice who had wrestled on the day of Nottingham
Fair with little Stuteley, the tumbler, for Squire o' th' Hall's purse.
Robin had an arrow through his hand, and nigh broke the shaft in pulling
it out.

The greenwood men, well satisfied with the day's work, commenced an
orderly retreat. Little John lowered the bridge for them, when they
reached the city gates, and all fell back into Sherwood in good style.
Stuteley had been rescued, and walked joyfully by the side of his
master. Next to him was Little John, and near him the widow's three
sons. They had already asked for and obtained permission to take up a
free life in the woods of Sherwood.

Two of the band had been killed by the murderous arrows of the Sheriff's
fellows, and most of the outlaws bore wounds of some sort. Yet they were
not cast down. Sorrow sat upon them for the loss of those two brave
hearts, but for their own hurts they cared naught. The bodies of their
comrades were being carried with them into the free and happy woods, and
there should find rest.

"Tell me, Midge," said Robin, presently, and looking round for him,
"what did become of the palmer who was so wishing to be of service to
our Stuteley? He seemed a likeable old man, and I would not that we
should seem ungrateful."

"I much fear me that Monceux's fellows did capture him, the same who
bore off thee, Will," said Midge. "But they will scarcely do him hurt,
being a holy man."

"I have no trust in either of them," Robin answered, vexed, "and I am
grievously angry with you, Midge, for keeping this news to yourself. The
palmer must be recovered from Monceux, and at once. I will bethink me
upon some plan to this end."

They walked on in silence. After a while, "I ne'er thought, Master,"

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

said Stuteley, brokenly, "that I should see these woods again--nor meet
Little John, either in quarrel or in friendship, nor see any of your
dear faces again."

"By my crown, which is the hardest part of me," Little John cried, "I
swear that in future you shall meet me how you will, gossip. Here's my
hand on it."

Thus began the great friendship between these two, which was to last
them all their days. Robin was glad enough of it; but the doubtful fate
of the palmer still troubled him sorely. If he had known then that
bitter truth which he was to learn very shortly he would have ridden
back forthwith into Nottingham town, there to end this story at once.
Life had, however, many years and queer twists in it yet for Robin Hood
of Barnesdale.
