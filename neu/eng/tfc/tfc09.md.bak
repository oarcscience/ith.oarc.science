### The Wife of Bath

IN the days of the renowned King Arthur, whom Britons hold in high
reverence, this land was peopled with fairies. The Elf Queen with all
her merry company have danced their roundels in many a green mead. What
I speak of happened many hundred years ago, but now the elves are seen
no more; for the charity and godly prayings of the begging friars who go
sniffing into every corner of the land, as thick as motes in the sun
beams, bestowing their blessings on cities and towns, halls, chambers,
and bowers, dairies and kitchens, are the cause that the fairies no
longer remain; for where the elf was formerly is now the friar,
steadfastly paying his visits at morning and noontide meals, not
forgetting his matins and benedictions as he makes his rounds of
alms-begging. Now the women can safely walk abroad, through brake and
copse, and sit under every green tree; the friar is your only
incubus, <span id="fr_21"></span>[\*](#fn_21.md) and he will offer us no
annoyance.

It happened that in the court of King Arthur dwelt a handsome and
vigorous young bachelor knight, who, on his return one day from a
hawking party of water-fowl, saw before him a young maiden, whom in a
transport of wilfulness and brutality he ill-treated. The unmanliness
and violence of the deed raised such a clamour, and so

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

keen a pursuit of the offender, that he was seized, tried, and condemned
to lose his head. The queen, however, and her ladies so earnestly
entreated his pardon of the king that he granted him his life, and at
the same time yielded him to his queen for her to order his penance:
who, turning to the ravisher, said, "Such is your condition at this
time, that you are in no surety of preserving your life; yet this will I
grant, upon condition that you resolve me this question, '*What is that
which women most desire?*' Beware! and think of your penalty. I allow
you to depart for one twelvemonth and a day to prepare your answer; and
before you quit this presence you shall produce full security that at
the given day you will yield yourself up to our decision upon your
reply."

The knight was sorely perplexed with the condition of his sentence; so
after much consideration he resolved to leave the court and travel till
the year's end, hoping that in the course of his adventures he might
receive the help he 'required. From town to town, and house to house he
went, wherever he thought to learn "what women most desire": but with
all his pains he could not find two people of one mind in the matter.
Some said women love wealth better than anything else; some said honour;
others, mirth; others again, splendour of dress; and some even thought
their greatest pleasure lay in being often widowed and wedded. They
came, perhaps, nearest to the truth who said that we are best pleased
when we are flattered, for one and all of us (more or less) are soonest
won by flattery. Attention and assiduity are the surest lime-twigs to
our hearts. Some said we must love to be free to follow our own
inclinations; moreover, to be esteemed

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

wise and not to be reproved for our faults; for, in truth, there is not
one of the sisterhood, who if she be fretted on a tender point, will not
turn again, and the more sharply for feeling that she deserves the
rebuke. He who may make the trial will prove the truth of what I say. Be
we never so faulty within, we *will* be held wise and free from offence.
Some folks held the opinion that we delight in being thought stedfast,
firm of purpose, and close keepers of a secret; but that tale is not
worth a straw; for we women can hide nothing—witness the folly of Midas’
wife—will ye hear the story?

Ovid, among other traditions, has related that Midas had growing under
his long shaggy hair two ass's ears, which he concealed so cleverly that
no one but his wife knew of the fact, and her he earnestly entreated to
keep the secret of his disfigurement. She made oath to him that for her
own sake as well as his she would not bring so great a shame upon her
husband, even were it to gain the whole world. Notwithstanding all this,
she was ready to expire with the pain of keeping this secret; she had
such a swelling of the heart that some unlucky word she feared must
necessarily slip out. Since, therefore, she dared tell it to no one, she
ran down to a marsh hard by, her heart all on fire till she arrived
there, and then like a bittern booming in the reeds, she laid her mouth
down, and said, "Betray me not, O water—to you I tell it, and no one
beside—my husband has two long ass's ears. And now is my heart at
ease—the secret is out, for I could keep it no longer." Thus you may
perceive that however stedfast we may remain for a time, out it must
come at last; we cannot hide a secret. The remainder

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

of the tale, if you desire it, is to be found in Ovid.

When this knight, the hero of my story, found he was no nearer to the
meaning of the riddle, he became very sorrowful, and the day having
arrived when he must render up himself, he turned homeward. On his way,
as he was riding by a forest-side, he perceived a company of more than
twenty ladies dancing upon the grass; but as he eagerly drew near to
them, hoping in his distress to gain some counsel from them, before he
came up the whole bevy of dancers had vanished, and no living soul was
left behind except a hideous old woman, bent double, and sitting on the
green. This creature, more frightful than can be described, arose and
went to meet the knight, and she said, "Sir Knight, this is no way to
any place. Tell me, upon your faith, what it is you seek; it may,
peradventure, be to your advantage: we old folk know, and can do much."

"Certain it is, dear mother," answered the knight, "that I shall be
doomed to die unless I am able to expound, 'What it is that women most
desire?' If you could instruct me I would amply repay you."

"Pledge me your truth," said she, "here in my hand, that, if it be in
your power, you will perform the next act I require of you, and before
night I will tell it you."

"I accept," said the knight, "and here is my truth."

"Then," said she, "I dare boast that you are safe, for upon my life the
queen will say as I do. Let us see the proudest she that wears a
kerchief who will dare say nay to what I shall tell you. So, without
farther parley, let us go forth." She then whispered in his ear a short
sentence, and bade him cheer up and cast off all fear.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

When they arrived at court, the knight said he had kept his word and the
day for delivering up himself, and was ready with his answer. Many noble
ladies had assembled to hear the sentence, the queen sitting as judge,
when the knight was commanded to appear in court, and silence being
obtained, the question, "What is it that women love best?" was put to
him in due form and solemnity; when, in the audience of the whole court,
and in a bold, manly voice, our knight answered, "My liege lady and most
royal mistress, what women desire above all things in this life is to
obtain dominion over their lovers and husbands, and in all matters to
sway them to their will. This is the nearest and dearest thought of your
hearts. Now, therefore, do with me as you list; I am in your power."
Throughout the whole court there was not a woman, whether maid, wife, or
widow, that contradicted him, and farthermore, they pronounced that he
had fairly obtained his pardon.

At the moment the sentence was delivered, up started the old woman whom
the knight had seen sitting on the green-sward. "Mercy! my sovereign
lady queen," said she, "before this court break up I entreat to have
justice rendered to me. I taught the knight this answer, for which he,
at the time, plighted me his truth that he would grant me the first
petition I might require at his hands, if it lay in his power to grant
it. Before this court then, Sir Knight, I pray you to take me for your
wife: I have preserved you from certain death; if I speak falsely, upon
your faith of knighthood gainsay my word."

"Alas!" answered the knight, "such indeed was my promise: but for the
love of heaven, I charge you to remodel

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

your petition. Take all my wealth, but let me go free."

"Nay, then," said she, "may a curse alight upon both of us if I, though
ugly, old, and poor, would not for all the gold above and beneath the
earth rather become your wife—aye! and your love too."

"My love!" said he, "my perdition! Oh! that any of my community should
be so foully brought into contempt!" All, however, was of no avail; he
was compelled to wed this old woman, and take her to bed and board "for
better for worse."

The joy, the display, and the feasting that was made upon the marriage
of these two is soon told; for, in good sooth, there was neither joy nor
feasting, but heaviness instead, and sullen sorrow. The knight was
married privately the next morning, and all the day, like an owl, hid
himself for vexation at the deformity of his wife. And at night he raged
and grumbled at his ill-fortune, his bride, the old woman, all the while
smiling by his side.

"My dear husband," said she, "does every gallant knight treat his
newly-made wife in this kind and graceful manner? Is this the custom of
King Arthur's court? Is every knight in his train so sparing of courtesy
and tenderness? I am your own love and your wife; I saved you from
destruction; and, of a truth, never wronged you: why then behave thus to
me? Your conduct is like one insane. What is my crime—my offence? Tell
me, and if I can I will amend it."

"Amend it!" said the knight, "no! no! you never can amend it. You are so
old, so loathsome, and born of so low degree, that little should you
wonder at my distress and

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

horror. Would to heaven my heart would break at once!" "Is this then,"
said she, "the cause of your uneasiness?" "Certainly, and what wonder
that it is."

"Now, sir," said she, "in three days, if I chose, I could mend all this,
so that you would bear yourself towards me as you ought. But since you
knights speak of such high birth as is descended from ancient wealth,
and presume that therefore you are gentlemen, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md) I tell you that such arrogance is not
worth a straw. He who secretly, and in the open face of day is most
virtuous, who seeks to perform all the noble deeds in his power, is the
most perfect gentleman. Jesus Christ commands that we claim our gentle
birth from Him who was 'meek and lowly of heart'; not from our ancestors
because of their riches. For, though they leave us the whole of their
inheritance, and boast of our high kindred, yet can they not bequeath to
us their virtuous lives which procured them the title of gentlemen.
Integrity of character seldom springs of its own accord in a man's
descendants. We derive our gentle birth from the goodness of God only;
from our ancestors we claim nothing but temporal benefits, which man may
destroy. If gentleness of demeanour were implanted in a certain lineage,
then would no one of that descent commit an act of villainy. But we know
that the sons of lords will often shame their parentage. And he who
demands praise of his gentility because he comes of a high family,
having noble and virtuous ancestors, yet himself performs no deeds of
gentleness, is no gentleman, duke or earl though he be; for deeds of
villainy constitute the base-born man. Gentility is but the renown of
your ancestors

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

on account of their signal goodness, and which is foreign to your
individual self. Your gentility, like theirs, proceeds from God only. He
is nobly born who performs noble deeds. Therefore, my beloved husband, I
conclude that although my ancestors were rustic, yet, as I hope to live
virtuously, then shall I become of gentle blood.

"And since you reprove me for my poverty, bear in mind that the Saviour
of the world dwelt in wilful poverty; and the King of Heaven would not
choose a vicious living. Cheerful poverty is doubtless an honest thing,
and I hold him rich who considers himself repaid for his poverty in
other gifts, although he have no shirt to his back; while the covetous
man is really poor, for he would possess that which he cannot attain,
but he who possesses nothing, yet covets nothing, is rich, although you
esteem him but a knave. <span id="fr_23"></span>[\*](#fn_23.md) The poor
man may go on his way and have no dread of robbers. Poverty is a hateful
good, though the redeemer from the cares of life: the improver of wisdom
to him who bears it patiently. Poverty makes a man know himself and his
Maker too. It is a glass in which he may discover his true friends.
Reprove me, therefore, no more for my poverty.

"As for my great age—though we had no written authority for the
command—you men of gentle blood have ever held that age, in man or
woman, is entitled to honour.

"And, to conclude, since I am loathsome as well as old, you will be in
no danger that any one will take away your wife. Now, therefore, choose
one of these two things: to have me old and ugly till my death, to be to

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

you a true and humble wife, and never to displease you during the whole
course of my life; or to have me young and beautiful, and to take your
chance of the temptation that will befall me from the great resort that
will throng to your house on my account."

The knight bethought him, sighed, and then said, "My dear wife, I place
myself under your wise direction: choose that which shall be most
pleasant to yourself, at the same time befitting my honour as well as
your own."

"Then have I gained the mastery," said she, "since I may choose and
govern according to my inclination!"

"Even so," said he, "I hold it best."

"Now, then," she replied, "throw aside all your anger against me, and
kiss me, for by my honour I will be to you both beautiful and true.
Moreover, may I be utterly condemned if I prove not as good and faithful
a wife as ever this world saw; and, on the morrow, as fair to see as any
lady or empress betwixt east and west. When you draw the curtains, you
shall behold how surely my promise has been fulfilled."

When the knight saw the fulfilment of this marvel, that she was both
young and exceedingly handsome, for joy he took her in his arms and
kissed her a thousand and a thousand times. His heart was bathed in
bliss; and so they lived to their lives' end, she obeying him in all
things and making his pleasure her happiness.
