<blockquote> 
<i>Calidore sees the Graces daunce,<br>
To Colins melody:<br>
The whiles his Pastorell is led,<br>
[I]nto captiuity.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
W
Ho now does follow the foule <i>Blatant Beast</i>,<br>
Whilest <i>Calidore</i> does follow that faire Mayd,<br>
Vnmyndfull of his vow and high beheast,<br>
Which by the Faery Queene was on him layd,<br>
That he should neuer leaue, nor be delayd<br>
From chacing him, till he had it attchieued?<br>
But now entrapt of loue, which him betrayd,<br>
He mindeth more, how he may be relieued<br>
With grace from her, whose loue his heart hath sore engrieued.<p>

That from henceforth he meanes no more to sew<br>
His former quest, so full of toile and paine;<br>
Another quest, another game in vew<br>
He hath, the guerdon of his loue to gaine:<br>
With whom he myndes for euer to remaine,<br>
And set his rest amongst the rusticke sort,<br>
Rather then hunt still after shadowes vaine<br>
Of courtly fauour, fed with light report,<br>
Of euery blaste, and sayling alwaies on the port.<p>

Ne certes mote he greatly blamed be,<br>
From so high step to stoupe vnto so low.<br>
For who had tasted once (as oft did he)<br>
The happy peace, which there doth ouerflow,<br>
And prou'd the perfect pleasures, which doe grow<br>
Amongst poore hyndes, in hils, in woods, in dales,<br>
Would neuer more delight in painted show<br>
Of such false blisse, as there is set for stales,<br>
T'entrap vnwary fooles in their eternall bales.<p>

For what hath all that goodly glorious gaze<br>
Like to one sight, which <i>Calidore</i> did vew?<br>
The glaunce whereof their dimmed eies would daze,<br>
That neuer more they should endure the shew<br>
Of that sunne-shine, that makes them looke askew.<br>
Ne ought in all that world of beauties rare,<br>
(Saue onely <i>Glorianaes</i> heauenly hew<br>
To which what can compare?) can it compare;<br>
The which as commeth now, by course I will declare.<p>

One day as he did raunge the fields abroad,<br>
Whilest his faire <i>Pastorella</i> was elsewhere,<br>
He chaunst to come, far from all peoples troad,<br>
Vnto a place, whose pleasaunce did appere<br>
To passe all others, on the earth which were:<br>
For all that euer was by natures skill<br>
Deuized to worke delight, was gathered there,<br>
And there by her were poured forth at fill,<br>
As if this to adorne, she all the rest did pill.<p>

It was an hill plaste in an open plaine,<br>
That round about was bordered with a wood<br>
Of matchlesse hight, that seem'd th'earth to disdaine;<br>
In which all trees of honour stately stood,<br>
And did all winter as in sommer bud,<br>
Spredding pauilions for the birds to bowre,<br>
Which in their lower braunches sung aloud;<br>
And in their tops the soring hauke did towre,<br>
Sitting like King of fowles in maiesty and powre.<p>

And at the foote thereof, a gentle flud<br>
His siluer waues did softly tumble downe,<br>
Vnmard with ragged mosse or filthy mud;<br>
Ne mote wylde beastes, ne mote the ruder clowne<br>
Thereto approch, ne filth mote therein drowne:<br>
But Nymphes and Faeries by the bancks did sit,<br>
In the woods shade, which did the waters crowne,<br>
Keeping all noysome things away from it,<br>
And to the waters fall tuning their accents fit.<p>

And on the top thereof a spacious plaine<br>
Did spred it selfe, to serue to all delight,<br>
Either to daunce, when they to daunce would faine,<br>
Or else to course about their bases light;<br>
Ne ought there wanted, which for pleasure might<br>
Desired be, or thence to banish bale:<br>
So pleasauntly the hill with equall hight,<br>
Did seeme to ouerlooke the lowly vale;<br>
Therefore it rightly cleeped was mount <i>Acidale</i>.<p>

They say that <i>Venus</i>, when she did dispose<br>
Her selfe to pleasaunce, vsed to resort<br>
Vnto this place, and therein to repose<br>
And rest her selfe, as in a gladsome port,<br>
Or with the Graces there to play and sport;<br>
That euen her owne Cytheron, though in it<br>
She vsed most to keepe her royall court,<br>
And in her soueraine Maiesty to sit,<br>
She in regard hereof refusde and thought vnfit.<p>

Vnto this place when as the Elfin Knight<br>
Approcht, him seemed that the merry sound<br>
Of a shrill pipe he playing heard on hight,<br>
And many feete fast thumping th'hollow ground,<br>
That through the woods their Eccho did rebound.<br>
He nigher drew, to weete what mote it be;<br>
There he a troupe of Ladies dauncing found<br>
Full merrily, and making gladfull glee,<br>
And in the midst a Shepheard piping he did see.<p>

He durst not enter into th'open greene,<br>
For dread of them vnwares to be descryde,<br>
For breaking of their daunce, if he were seene;<br>
But in the couert of the wood did byde,<br>
Beholding all, yet of them vnespyde.<br>
There he did see, that pleased much his sight,<br>
That euen he him selfe his eyes enuyde,<br>
An hundred naked maidens lilly white,<br>
All raunged in a ring, and dauncing in delight.<p>

All they without were raunged in a ring,<br>
And daunced round ; but in the midst of them<br>
Three other Ladies did both daunce and sing,<br>
The whilest the rest them round about did hemme,<br>
And like a girlond did in compasse stemme:<br>
And in the middest of those same three, was placed<br>
Another Damzell, as a precious gemme,<br>
Amidst a ring most richly well enchaced,<br>
That with her goodly presence all the rest much graced.<p>

Looke how the Crowne, which <i>Ariadne</i> wore<br>
Vpon her yuory forehead that same day<br>
That <i>Theseus</i> her vnto his bridale bore,<br>
When the bold <i>Centaures</i> made that bloudy fray<br>
With the fierce <i>Lapithes</i>, which did them dismay;<br>
Being now placed in the firmament,<br>
Through the bright heauen doth her beams display,<br>
And is vnto the starres an ornament,<br>
Which round about her moue in order excellent.<p>

Such was the beauty of this goodly band,<br>
Whose sundry parts were here too long to tell:<br>
But she that in the midst of them did stand,<br>
Seem'd all the rest in beauty to excell,<br>
Crownd with a rosie girlond, that right well<br>
Did her beseeme. And euer, as the crew<br>
About her daunst, sweet flowres, that far did smell,<br>
And fragrant odours they vppon her threw;<br>
But most of all, those three did her with gifts endew.<p>

Those were the Graces, daughters of delight,<br>
Handmaides of <i>Venus</i>, which are wont to haunt<br>
Vppon this hill, and daunce there day and night:<br>
Those three to men all gifts of grace do graunt,<br>
And all, that <i>Venus</i> in her selfe doth vaunt,<br>
Is borrowed of them.  But that faire one,<br>
That in the midst was placed parauaunt,<br>
Was she to whom that shepheard pypt alone,<br>
That made him pipe so merrily, as neuer none.<p>

She was to weete that iolly Shepheards lasse,<br>
Which piped there vnto that merry rout:<br>
That iolly shepheard, which there piped, was<br>
Poore <i>Colin Clout</i> (who knowes not <i>Colin Clout</i>?)<br>
He pypt apace, whilest they him daunst about.<br>
Pype iolly shepheard, pype thou now apace<br>
Vnto thy loue, that made thee low to lout;<br>
Thy Loue is present there with thee in place,<br>
Thy Loue is there aduaunst to be another Grace.<p>

Much wondred <i>Calidore</i> at this straunge sight,<br>
Whose like before his eye had neuer seene,<br>
And standing long astonished in spright,<br>
And rapt with pleasaunce, wist not what to weene;<br>
Whether it were the traine of beauties Queene,<br>
Or Nymphes, or Faeries, or enchaunted show,<br>
With which his eyes mote haue deluded beene.<br>
Therefore resoluing, what it was, to know,<br>
Out of the wood he rose, and toward them did go.<p>

But soone as he appeared to their vew,<br>
The vanisht all away out of his sight,<br>
And cleane were gone, which way he neuer knew;<br>
All saue the shepheard, who for fell despight<br>
Of that displeasure, broke his bag-pipe quight,<br>
And made great mone for that vnhappy turne.<br>
But <i>Calidore</i>, though no lesse sory wight,<br>
For that mishap, yet seeing him to mourne,<br>
Drew neare, that he the truth of all by him mote learne.<p>

And first him greeting, thus vnto him spake;<br>
Haile iolly shepheard, which thy ioyous dayes<br>
Here leadest in this goodly merry make,<br>
Frequented of these gentle Nymphes alwayes,<br>
Which to thee flocke, to heare thy louely layes;<br>
Tell me, what mote these dainty Damzels be,<br>
Which here with thee doe make their pleasant playes?<br>
Right happy thou, that mayst them freely see:<br>
But why when I them saw, fled they away from me?<p>

Not I so happy, answerd then that swaine,<br>
As thou vnhappy, which them thence didst chace,<br>
Whom by no meanes thou canst recall againe;<br>
For being gone, none can them bring in place,<br>
But whom they of them selues list so to grace.<br>
Right sory I, (saide then Sir <i>Calidore</i>,)<br>
That my ill fortune did them hence displace.<br>
But since things passed none may now restore,<br>
Tell, me what were they all, whose lacke thee grieues so sore.<p>

Tho gan that shepheard thus for to dilate;<br>
Then wote thou shepheard, whatsoeuer thou bee,<br>
That all those Ladies, which thou sawest late,<br>
Are <i>Venus</i> Damzels, all within her fee,<br>
But differing in honour and degree:<br>
They all are Graces, which on her depend,<br>
Besides a thousand more, which ready bee<br>
Her to adorne, when so she forth doth wend:<br>
But those three in the midst, doe chiefe on her attend.<p>

They are the daughters of sky-ruling <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
By him begot of faire <i>Eurynome</i>,<br>
The Oceans daughter, in this pleasant groue,<br>
As he this way comming from feastfull glee,<br>
Of <i>Thetis</i> wedding with <i>&AElig;acidee</i>,<br>
In sommers shade himselfe here rested weary.<br>
The first of them hight mylde <i>Euphrosyne</i>,<br>
Next faire <i>Aglaia</i>, last <i>Thalia</i> merry:<br>
Sweete Goddesses all three which me in mirth do cherry.<p>

These three on men all gracious gifts bestow,<br>
Which decke to body or adorne the mynde,<br>
To make them louely or well fauoured show,<br>
As comely carriage, entertainement kynde,<br>
Sweete semblaunt, friendly offices that bynde,<br>
And all the complements of curtesie:<br>
They teach vs, how to each degree and kynde<br>
We should our selues demeane, to low, to hie;<br>
To firends, to foes, which skill men call Ciuility.<p>

Therefore they alwaies smoothly seeme to smile,<br>
That we likewise should mylde and gentle be,<br>
And also naked are, that without guile<br>
Or false dissemblaunce all them plaine may see,<br>
Simple and true from couert malice free:<br>
And eeke them selues so in their daunce they bore,<br>
That two of them still fr[ow]ard seem'd to bee,<br>
But one still towards shew'd her selfe afore;<br>
That good should from vs goe, then come in greater store.<p>

Such were those Goddesses, which ye did see;<br>
But that fourth Mayd, which there amidst th&#7869; traced,<br>
Who can aread, what creature mote she bee,<br>
Whether a creature, or a goddesse graced<br>
With heauenly gifts from heuen first enraced?<br>
But what so sure she was, she worthy was,<br>
For be the fourth with those three other placed:<br>
Yet was she certes but a countrey lasse,<br>
Yet she all other countrey lasses farre did passe.<p>

So farre as doth the daughter of the day,<br>
All other lesser lights in light excell,<br>
So farre doth she in beautyfull array,<br>
Aboue all other lasses beare the bell,<br>
Ne lesse in vertue that beseemes her well,<br>
Doth she exceede the rest of all her race;<br>
For which the Graces that here wont to dwell,<br>
Haue for more honor brought her to this place,<br>
And graced her so much to be another Grace.<p>

Another Grace she well deserues to be,<br>
In whom so many Graces gathered are,<br>
Excelling much the meane of her degree;<br>
Diuine resemblaunce, beauty soueraine rare,<br>
Firme Chastity, that spight ne blemish dare;<br>
All which she with such courtesie doth grace,<br>
That all her peres cannot with her compare,<br>
But quite are dimmed, when she is in place.<br>
She made me often pipe and now to pipe apace.<p>

Sunne of the world, great glory of the sky,<br>
That all the earth doest lighten with thy rayes,<br>
Great <i>Gloriana</i>, greatest Maiesty,<br>
Pardon thy shepheard, mongst so many layes,<br>
As he hath sung of thee in all his dayes,<br>
To make one minime of thy poore handmayd,<br>
And vnderneath thy feete to place her prayse;<br>
That when thy glory shall be farre displayd<br>
To future age of her this mention may be made.<p>

When thus that shepherd ended had his speach,<br>
Sayd <i>Calidore</i> ; Now sure it yrketh mee,<br>
That to thy blisse I made this luckelesse breach,<br>
As now the author of thy bale to be,<br>
Thus to bereaue thy Loues deare sight from thee:<br>
But gentle Shepheard pardon thou my shame,<br>
Who rashly sought that, which I mote not see.<br>
Thus did the courteous Knight excuse his blame,<br>
And to recomfort him, all comely meanes did frame.<p>

In such discourses they together spent<br>
Long time, as fit occasion forth them led;<br>
With which the Knight him selfe did much content,<br>
And with delight his greedy fancy fed,<br>
Both of his words, which he with reason red;<br>
And also of the place, whose pleasures rare<br>
With such regard his sences rauished,<br>
That thence, he had no will away to fare,<br>
But wisht, that with that shepheard he mote dwelling share.<p>

But that enuenimd sting, the which of yore,<br>
His poysnous point deepe fixed in his hart<br>
Had left, now gan afresh to rancle sore,<br>
And to renue the rigour of his smart:<br>
Which to recure, no skill of Leaches art<br>
Mote him auaile, but to returne againe<br>
To his wounds worker, that with louely dart<br>
Dinting his brest, had bred his restlesse paine,<br>
Like as the wounded Whale to shore flies fro&otilde; the maine.<p>

So taking leaue of that same gentle swaine,<br>
He backe returned to his rusticke wonne,<br>
Where his faire <i>Pastorella</i> did remaine:<br>
To whome in sort, as he at first begonne,<br>
He daily did apply him selfe to donne<br>
All dewfull seruice voide of thoughts imp[u]re:<br>
Ne any paines ne perill did he shonne,<br>
By which he might her to his loue allure,<br>
And liking in her yet vntamed heart procure.<p>

And euermore the shepheard <i>Coridon</i>,<br>
What euer thing he did her to aggrate,<br>
Did striue to match with strong contention,<br>
And all his paines did closely emulate;<br>
Whether it were to caroll, as they sate<br>
Keeping their sheepe, or games to exercize,<br>
Or to present her with their labours late;<br>
Through which if any grace chaunst to arize<br>
To him, the Shepheard streight with iealousie did frize.<p>

One day as they all three together went<br>
To the greene wood, to gather strawberies,<br>
There chaunst to them a dangerous accident;<br>
A Tigre forth out of the wood did rise,<br>
That with fell clawes full of fierce gourmandize,<br>
And greedy mouth, wide gaping like hell gate,<br>
Did runne at <i>Pastorell</i>, her to surprize:<br>
Whom she beholding, now all desolate<br>
Gan cry to them aloud, to helpe ere all too late.<p>

Which <i>Coridon</i> first hearing, ran in hast<br>
To reskue her, but when he saw the feend,<br>
Through cowherd feare he fled away as fast,<br>
Ne durst abide the daunger of the end;<br>
His life he steemed dearer then his frend.<br>
But <i>Calidore</i> soone comming to her ayde,<br>
When he the beast saw ready now to rend<br>
His Loues deare spoile, in which his heart was prayde,<br>
He ran at him enrag[e]d in stead of being frayde.<p>

He had no weapon, but his shepheards hooke,<br>
To serue the vengeaunce of his wrathfull will;<br>
With which so sternely he the monster strooke,<br>
That to the ground astonished he fell;<br>
Whence ere he could recou'r, he did him quell,<br>
And hewing off his head, [he] it presented<br>
Before the feete of the faire <i>Pastorell</i>;<br>
Who scarcely yet from former feare exempted,<br>
A thousand times him thankt, that had her death preuented.<p>

From that day forth she gan him to affect,<br>
And daily more her fauour to augment;<br>
But <i>Coridon</i> for cowherdize reiect,<br>
Fit to keepe sheepe, vnfit for loues content:<br>
The gentle heart scornes base disparagement.<br>
Yet <i>Calidore</i> did not despise him quight,<br>
But vsde him friendly for further intent,<br>
That by his fellowship, he colour might<br>
Both his estate, and loue from skill of any wight.<p>

So well he wood her, and so well he wrought her,<br>
With humble seruice, and with daily sute,<br>
That at the last vnto his will he brought her;<br>
Which he so wisely well did prosecute,<br>
That of his loue he reapt the timely frute,<br>
And ioyed long in close felicity:<br>
Till fortune fraught with malice, blinde, and brute,<br>
That enuies louers long prosperity,<br>
Blew vp a bitter storme of foule aduersity.<p>

It fortuned one day, when <i>Calidore</i><br>
Was hunting in the woods (as was his trade)<br>
A lawlesse people, <i>Brigants</i> hight of yore,<br>
That neuer vsde to liue by plough nor spade,<br>
But fed on spoile and booty, which they made<br>
Vpon their neighbours, which did nigh them border,<br>
The dwelling of these shepheards did inuade,<br>
And spoyld their houses, and them selues did murder;<br>
And droue away their flocks, with other much disorder.<p>

Amongst the rest, the which they then did pray,<br>
They spoyld old <i>Melibee</i> of all he had,<br>
And all his people captiue led away;<br>
Mongst which this lucklesse mayd away was lad,<br>
Faire <i>Pastorella</i>, sorrowfull and sad,<br>
Most sorrowfull, most sad, that euer sigh't,<br>
Now made the spoile of theeues and <i>Brigants</i> bad,<br>
Which was the conquest of the gentlest Knight,<br>
That euer liu'd, and th'onely glory of his might.<p>

With them also was taken <i>Coridon</i>,<br>
And carried captiue by those theeues away;<br>
Who in the couert of the night, that none<br>
Mote them descry, nor reskue from their pray,<br>
Vnto their dwelling did them close conuay.<br>
Their dwelling in a little Island was,<br>
Couered with shrubby woods, in which no way<br>
Appeard for people in nor out to pas,<br>
Nor any footing fynde for ouergrowen gras.<p>

For vnderneath the ground their way was made,<br>
Through hollow caues, that no man mote discouer<br>
For the thicke shrubs, which did them alwaies shade<br>
From view of liuing wight, and couered ouer:<br>
But darkenesse dred and daily night did houer<br>
Through all the inner parts, wherein they dwelt,<br>
Ne lightned was with window, nor with louer,<br>
But with continuall candlelight, which delt<br>
A doubtfull sense of things, not so well seene, as felt.<p>

Hither those <i>Brigants</i> brought their present pray,<br>
And kept them with continuall watch and ward,<br>
Meaning so soone, as they conuenient may,<br>
For slaues to sell them, for no small reward,<br>
To merchants, which them kept in bondage hard,<br>
Or sold againe. Now when faire <i>Pastorell</i><br>
Into this place was brought, and kept with gard<br>
Of griesly theeues, she thought her self in hell,<br>
Where with such damned fiends she should in darknesse dwell.<p>

But for to tell the dolefull dreriment,<br>
And pittifull complaints, which there she made,<br>
Where day and night she nought did but lament<br>
Her wretched life, shut vp in deadly shade,<br>
And waste her goodly beauty, which did fade<br>
Like to a flowre, that feeles no heate of sunne,<br>
Which may her feeble leaues with comfort glade.<br>
But what befell her in that theeuish wonne,<br>
Will in an other Canto better be begonne.<p>
