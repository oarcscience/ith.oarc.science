*Canto I.*

> *Calidore saues from Maleffort,  
> A Damzell vsed vylde:  
> Doth vanquish Crudor, and doth make  
> Briana wexe more mylde.*

> O F Court it seemes, men Courtesie doe call,  
> For that it there most vseth to abound;  
> And well beseemeth that in Princes hall  
> That vertue should be plentifully found,  
> Which of all goodly manners is the ground,  
> And roote of ciuill conuersation.  
> Right so in Faery court it did redound,  
> Where curteous Knights and Ladies most did won  
> Of all on earth, and made a matchlesse paragon.
>
> But mongst them all was none more courteous Knight,  
> Then *Calidore*, beloued ouer all,  
> In whom it seemes, that gentlenesse of spright  
> And manners mylde were planted naturall;  
> To which he adding comely guize withall,  
> And gracious speach, did steale mens hearts away.  
> Nathlesse thereto he was full stout and tall,  
> And well approu'd in batteilous affray,  
> That him did much renowme, and far his fame display.
>
> Ne was there Knight, ne was there Lady found  
> In Faery court, but him did deare embrace,  
> For his faire vsage and conditions sound,  
> The which in all mens liking gayned place,  
> And with the greatest purchast greatest grace:  
> Which he could wisely vse, and well apply,  
> To please the best, and th'euill to embase.  
> For he loathd leasing, and base flattery,  
> And loued simple truth and stedfast honesty.
>
> And now he was in trauell on his way,  
> Vppon an hard aduenture sore bestad,  
> Whenas by chaunce he met vppon a day  
> With *Artegall*, returning yet halfe sad  
> From his late conquest, which he gotten had.  
> Who whenas each of other had a sight,  
> They knew them selues, and both their persons rad:  
> When *Calidore* thus first; Haile noblest Knight  
> Of all this day on ground, that breathen liuing spright.
>
> Now tell, if please you, of the good successe,  
> Which ye haue had in your late enterprize.  
> To whom Sir *Artegall* gan to expresse  
> His whole exploite, and valorous emprize,  
> In order as it did to him arize.  
> Now happy man (sayd then Sir *Calidore*)  
> Which haue so goodly, as ye can deuize,  
> Atchieu'd so hard a quest, as few before;  
> That shall you most renowmed make for euermore.
>
> But where ye ended haue, now I begin  
> To tread an endlesse trace, withouten guyde,  
> Or good direction, how to enter in,  
> Or how to issue forth in waies vntryde,  
> In perils strange, in labours long and wide;  
> In which although good Fortune me befall,  
> Yet shall it not by none be testifyde.  
> What is that quest (quoth then Sir *Artegall*)  
> That you into such perils presently doth call?
>
> The Blattant Beast (quoth he) I doe pursew,  
> And through the world incessantly doe chase,  
> Till I him ouertake, or else subdew:  
> Yet know I not or how, or in what place  
> To find him out, yet still I forward trace.  
> What is that Blattant Beast? (then he replide)  
> It is a Monster bred of hellishe race,  
> (Then answerd he) which often hath annoyd  
> Good Knights and Ladies true, and many else destroyd.
>
> Of *Cerberus* whilome he was begot,  
> And fell *Chimaelig;ra* in her darkesome den,  
> Through fowle commixture of his filthy blot;  
> Where he was fostred long in *Stygian* fen,  
> Till he to perfect ripenesse grew, and then  
> Into this wicked world he forth was sent,  
> To be the plague and scourge of wretched men:  
> Whom with vile tongue and venemous intent  
> He sore doth wound, and bite, and cruelly torment.
>
> Then since the saluage Island I did leaue  
> Sayd *Artegall*, I such a Beast did see,  
> The which did seeme a thousand tongues to haue,  
> That all in spight and malice did agree,  
> With which he bayd and loudly barkt at mee,  
> As if that he attonce would me deuoure.  
> But I that knew my selfe from perill free,  
> Did nought regard his malice nor his powre,  
> But he the more his wicked poyson forth did poure.
>
> That surely is that Beast (saide *Calidore*)  
> Which I pursue, of whom I am right glad  
> To heare these tidings, which of none afore  
> Through all my weary trauell I haue had:  
> Yet now some hope your words vnto me add.  
> Now God you speed (quoth then Sir *Artegall*)  
> And keepe your body from the daunger drad:  
> For ye haue much adoe to deale withall.  
> So both tooke goodly leaue, and parted seuerall.
>
> Sir *Calidore* thence trauelled not long,  
> When as by chaunce a comely Squire he found,  
> That thorough some more mighty enemies wrong,  
> Both hand and foote vnto a tree was bound:  
> Who seeing him from farre, with piteous sound  
> Of his shrill cries him called to his aide.  
> To whom approching, in that painefull stound  
> When he him saw, for no demaunds he staide,  
> But first him losde, and afterwards thus to him saide.
>
> Vnhappy Squire, what hard mishap thee brought  
> Into this bay of perill and disgrace?  
> What cruell hand thy wretched thraldome wrought,  
> And thee captyued in this shamefull place?  
> To whom he answerd thus; My haplesse case  
> Is not occasiond through my misdesert,  
> But through misfortune, which did me abase  
> Vnto this shame, and my young hope subuert,  
> Ere that I in her guilefull traines was well expert.
>
> Not farre from hence, vppon yond rocky hill,  
> Hard by a streight there stands a castle strong,  
> Which doth obserue a custome lewd and ill,  
> And it hath long mayntaind with mighty wrong:  
> For may no Knight nor Lady passe along  
> That way, (and yet they needs must passe that way),  
> By reason of the streight, and rocks among,  
> But they that Ladies lockes doe shaue away,  
> And that knights berd for toll, which they for passage pay.
>
> A shamefull vse as euer I did heare,  
> Sayd *Calidore*, and to be ouerthrowne.  
> But by what meanes did they at first it reare,  
> And for what cause, tell if thou haue it knowne.  
> Sayd then that Squire: The Lady which doth owne  
> This Castle, is by name *Briana* hight.  
> Then which a prouder Lady liueth none:  
> She long time hath deare lou'd a doughty Knight,  
> And sought to win his loue by all the meanes she might.
>
> His name is *Crudor*, who through high disdaine  
> And proud despight of his selfe pleasing mynd,  
> Refused hath to yeeld her loue againe,  
> Vntill a Mantle she for him doe fynd,  
> With beards of Knights and locks of Ladies lynd.  
> Which to prouide, she hath this Castle dight,  
> And therein hath a Seneschall assynd,  
> Cald *Maleffort*, a man of mickle might,  
> Who executes her wicked will, with worse despight.
>
> He this same day, as I that way did come  
> With a faire Damzell, my beloued deare,  
> In execution of her lawlesse doome,  
> Did set vppon vs flying both for feare:  
> For little bootes against him hand to reare.  
> Me first he tooke, vnhable to withstond;  
> And whiles he her pursued euery where,  
> Till his returne vnto this tree he bond:  
> Ne wote I surely, whether her he yet haue fond.
>
> Thus whiles they spake, they heard a ruefull shrieke  
> Of one loud crying, which they streight way ghest,  
> That it was she, the which for helpe did seeke.  
> Tho looking vp vnto the cry to lest,  
> They saw that Carle from farre, with hand vnblest  
> Hayling that mayden by the yellow heare,  
> That all her garments from her snowy brest,  
> And from her head her lockes he nigh did teare,  
> Ne would he spare for pitty, nor refraine for feare.
>
> Which haynous sight when *Calidore* beheld,  
> Eftsoones he loosd that Squire, and so him left,  
> With hearts dismay and inward dolour queld,  
> For to pursue that villaine, which had reft  
> That piteous spoile by so iniurious theft.  
> Whom ouertaking, loude to him he cryde;  
> Leaue faytor quickely that misgotten weft  
> To him, that hath it better iustifyde,  
> And turne thee soone to him, of whom thou art defyde.
>
> Who hearkning to that voice, him selfe vpreard,  
> And seeing him so fiercely towardes make,  
> Against him stoutly ran, as nought afeard,  
> But rather more enrag'd for those words sake;  
> And with sterne count'naunce thus vnto him spake.  
> Art thou the caytiue, that defyest me,  
> And for this Mayd, whose party thou doest take,  
> Wilt giue thy beard, though it but little bee?  
> Yet shall it not her lockes for raunsome fro me free.
>
> With that he fiercely at him flew, and layd  
> On hideous strokes with most importune might,  
> That oft he made him stagger as vnstayd,  
> And oft recuile to shunne his sharpe despight.  
> But *Calidore*, that was well skild in fight,  
> Him long forbore, and still his spirite spar'd,  
> Lying in waite, how him he damadge might.  
> But when he felt him shrinke, and come to ward,  
> He greater grew, and gan to driue at him more hard.
>
> Like as a water streame, whose swelling sourse  
> Shall driue a Mill, within strong bancks is pent,  
> And long restrayned of his ready course;  
> So soone as passage is vnto him lent,  
> Breakes forth, and makes his way more violent.  
> Such was the fury of Sir *Calidore*,  
> When once he felt his foeman to relent;  
> He fiercely him pursu'd, and pressed sore,  
> Who as he still decayd, so he encreased more.
>
> The heauy burden of whose dreadfull might  
> When as the Carle no longer could sustaine,  
> His heart gan faint, and streight he tooke his flight  
> Toward the Castle, where if need constraine,  
> His hope of refuge vsed to remaine.  
> Whom *Calidore* perceiuing fast to flie,  
> He him pursu'd and chaced through the plaine,  
> That he for dread of death gan loude to crie  
> Vnto the ward, to open to him hastilie.
>
> They from the wall him seeing so aghast,  
> The gate soone opened to receiue him in,  
> But *Calidore* did follow him so fast,  
> That euen in the Porch he him did win,  
> And cleft his head asunder to his chin.  
> The carkasse tumbling downe within the dore,  
> Did choke the entraunce with a lumpe of sin,  
> That it could not be shut, whilest *Calidore*  
> Did enter in, and slew the Porter on the flore.
>
> With that the rest, the which the Castle kept,  
> About him flockt, and hard at him did lay;  
> But he them all from him full lightly swept,  
> As doth a Steare, in heat of sommers day,  
> With his long taile the bryzes brush away.  
> Thence passing forth, into the hall he came,  
> Where of the Lady selfe in sad dismay  
> He was ymett, who with vncomely shame  
> Gan him salute, and fowle vpbrayd with faulty blame.
>
> False traytor Knight, (sayd she) no Knight at all,  
> But scorne of armes that hast with guilty hand  
> Murdred my men, and slaine my Seneschall;  
> Now comest thou to rob my house vnmand,  
> And spoile my selfe, that can not thee withstand?  
> Yet doubt thou not, but that some better Knight  
> Then thou, that shall thy treason vnderstand,  
> Will it auenge, and pay thee with thy right:  
> And if none do, yet shame shal thee with shame requight.
>
> Much was the Knight abashed at that word;  
> Yet answerd thus; Not vnto me the shame,  
> But to the shamefull doer it afford.  
> Bloud is no blemish; for it is no blame  
> To punish those, that doe deserue the same;  
> But they that breake bands of ciuilitie,  
> And wicked customes make, those doe defame  
> Both noble armes and gentle curtesie.  
> No greater shame to man then inhumanitie.
>
> Then doe your selfe, for dread of shame, forgoe  
> This euill manner, which ye here maintaine,  
> And doe in stead thereof mild curt'sie showe  
> To all, that passe. That shall you glory gaine  
> More then his loue, which thus ye seeke t'obtaine.  
> Wherewith all full of wrath, she thus replyde;  
> Vile recreant, know that I doe much disdaine  
> Thy courteous lore, that doest my loue deride,  
> Who scornes thy ydle scoffe, and bids thee be defyde.
>
> To take defiaunce at a Ladies word  
> (Quoth he) I hold it no indignity;  
> But were he here, that would it with his sword  
> Abett, perhaps he mote it deare aby.  
> Cowherd (quoth she) were not, that thou wouldst fly,  
> Ere he doe come, he should be soone in place.  
> If I doe so, (sayd he) then liberty  
> I leaue to you, for aye me to disgrace  
> With all those shames, that erst ye spake me to deface.
>
> With that a Dwarfe she cald to her in hast,  
> And taking from her hand a ring of gould,  
> A priuy token, which betweene them past,  
> Bad him to flie with all the speed he could,  
> To *Crudor*, and desire him that he would  
> Vouchsafe to reskue her against a Knight,  
> Who through strõg powre had now her self in hould,  
> Hauing late slaine her Seneschall in fight,  
> And all her people murdred with outragious might.
>
> The Dwarfe his way did hast, and went all night;  
> But *Calidore* did with her there abyde  
> The comming of that so much threatned Knight,  
> Where that discourteous Dame with scornfull pryde,  
> And fowle entreaty him indignifyde,  
> That yron heart it hardly could sustaine:  
> Yet he, that could his wrath full wisely guyde,  
> Did well endure her womanish disdaine,  
> And did him selfe from fraile impatience refraine.
>
> The morrow next, before the lampe of light,  
> Aboue the earth vpreard his flaming head,  
> The Dwarfe, which bore that message to her knight,  
> Brought aunswere backe, that ere he tasted bread,  
> He would her succour, and aliue or dead  
> Her foe deliuer vp into her hand:  
> Therefore he wild her doe away all dread;  
> And that of him she mote assured stand,  
> He sent to her his basenet, as a faithfull band.
>
> Thereof full blyth the Lady streight became,  
> And gan t'augment her bitternesse much more:  
> Yet no whit more appalled for the same,  
> Ne ought dismayed was Sir *Calidore*,  
> But rather did more chearefull seeme therefore.  
> And hauing soone his armes about him dight,  
> Did issue forth, to meete his foe afore;  
> Where long he stayed not, when as a Knight  
> He spide come pricking on with al his powre and might.
>
> Well weend he streight, that he should be the same,  
> Which tooke in hand her quarrell to maintaine;  
> Ne stayd to aske if it were he by name,  
> But coucht his speare, and ran at him amaine.  
> They bene ymett in middest of the plaine,  
> With so fell fury, and dispiteous forse,  
> That neither could the others stroke sustaine,  
> But rudely rowld to ground both man and horse,  
> Neither of other taking pitty nor remorse.
>
> But *Calidore* vprose againe full light,  
> Whiles yet his foe lay fast in sencelesse sound,  
> Yet would he not him hurt, although he might:  
> For shame he weend a sleeping wight to wound.  
> But when *Briana* saw that drery stound,  
> There where she stood vppon the Castle wall,  
> She deem'd him sure to haue bene dead on ground,  
> And made such piteous mourning therewithall,  
> That from the battlements she ready seem'd to fall.
>
> Nathlesse at length him selfe he did vpreare  
> In lustlesse wise, as if against his will,  
> Ere he had slept his fill, he wakened were,  
> And gan to stretch his limbs; which feeling ill  
> Of his late fall, a while he rested still:  
> But when he saw his foe before in vew,  
> He shooke off luskishnesse, and courage chill  
> Kindling a fresh, gan battell to renew,  
> To proue if better foote then horsebacke would ensew.
>
> There then began a fearefull cruell fray  
> Betwixt them two, for maystery of might.  
> For both were wondrous practicke in that play,  
> And passing well expert in single fight,  
> And both inflam'd with furious despight:  
> Which as it still encreast, so still increast  
> Their cruell strokes and terrible affright;  
> Ne once for ruth their rigour they releast,  
> Ne once to breath a while their angers tempest ceast.
>
> Thus long they trac'd and trauerst to and fro,  
> And tryde all waies, how each mote entrance make  
> Into the life of his malignant foe;  
> They hew'd their helmes, and plates asunder brake,  
> As they had potshares bene; for nought mote slake  
> Their greedy vengeaunces, but goary blood,  
> That at the last like to a purple lake  
> Of bloudy gore congeal'd about them stood,  
> Which from their riuen sides forth gushed like a flood.
>
> At length it chaunst, that both their hands on hie,  
> At once did heaue, with all their powre and might,  
> Thinking the vtmost of their force to trie,  
> And proue the finall fortune of the fight:  
> But *Calidore*, that was more quicke of sight,  
> And nimbler handed, then his enemie,  
> Preuented him before his stroke could light,  
> And on the helmet smote him formerlie,  
> That made him stoupe to ground with meeke humilitie.
>
> And ere he could recouer foot againe,  
> He following that faire aduantage fast,  
> His stroke redoubled with such might and maine,  
> That him vpon the ground he groueling cast;  
> And leaping to him light, would haue vnlast  
> His Helme, to make vnto his vengeance way.  
> Who seeing, in what daunger he was plast,  
> Cryde out, Ah mercie Sir, doe me not slay,  
> But saue my life, which lot before your foot doth lay.
>
> With that his mortall hand a while he stayd,  
> And hauing somewhat calm'd his wrathfull heat  
> With goodly patience, thus he to him sayd;  
> And is the boast of that proud Ladies threat,  
> That menaced me from the field to beat,  
> Now brought to this? By this now may ye learne,  
> Strangers no more so rudely to intreat,  
> But put away proud looke, and vsage sterne,  
> The which shal nought to you but foule dishonor yearne.
>
> For nothing is more blamefull to a knight,  
> That court'sie doth as well as armes professe,  
> How euer strong and fortunate in fight,  
> Then the reproch of pride and cruelnesse.  
> In vaine he seeketh others to suppresse,  
> Who hath not learnd him selfe first to subdew:  
> All flesh is frayle, and full of ficklenesse,  
> Subiect to fortunes chance, still chaunging new;  
> What haps to day to me, to morrow may to you.
>
> Who will not mercie vnto others shew,  
> How can he mercy euer hope to haue?  
> To pay each with his owne is right and dew.  
> Yet since ye mercie now doe need to craue,  
> I will it graunt, your hopelesse life to saue;  
> With these conditions, which I will propound:  
> First, that ye better shall your selfe behaue  
> Vnto all errant knights, whereso on ground;  
> Next that ye Ladies ayde in euery stead and stound.
>
> The wretched man, that all this while did dwell  
> In dread of death, his heasts did gladly heare,  
> And promist to performe his precept well,  
> And whatsoeuer else he would requere.  
> So suffring him to rise, he made him sweare  
> By his owne sword, and by the crosse thereon,  
> To take *Briana* for his louing fere,  
> Withouten dowre or composition;  
> But to release his former foule condition.
>
> All which accepting, and with faithfull oth  
> Bynding himselfe most firmely to obay,  
> He vp arose, how euer liefe or loth,  
> And swore to him true fealtie for aye.  
> Then forth he cald from sorrowfull dismay  
> The sad *Briana*, which all this beheld:  
> Who comming forth yet full of late affray,  
> Sir *Calidore* vpcheard, and to her teld  
> All this accord, to which he *Crudor* had compeld.
>
> Whereof she now more glad, then sory earst,  
> All ouercome with infinite affect,  
> For his exceeding courtesie, that pearst  
> Her stubborne hart with inward deepe effect,  
> Before his feet her selfe she did proiect,  
> And him adoring as her liues deare Lord,  
> With all due thankes, and dutifull respect,  
> Her selfe acknowledg'd bound for that accord,  
> By which he had to her both life and loue restord.
>
> So all returning to the Castle glad,  
> Most ioyfully she them did entertaine,  
> Where goodly glee and feast to them she made,  
> To shew her thankefull mind and meaning faine,  
> By all the meanes she mote it best explaine:  
> And after all, vnto Sir *Calidore*  
> She freely gaue that Castle for his paine,  
> And her selfe bound to him for euermore;  
> So wondrously now chaung'd, from that she was afore.
>
> But *Calidore* himselfe would not retaine  
> Nor land nor fee, for hyre of his good deede,  
> But gaue them streight vnto that Squire againe,  
> Whom from her Seneschall he lately freed,  
> And to his damzell as their rightfull meed,  
> For recompence of all their former wrong:  
> There he remaind with them right well agreed,  
> Till of his wounds he wexed hole and strong,  
> And then to his first quest he passed forth along.
