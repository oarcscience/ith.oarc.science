*Cant. VIII.*

> *The gentle Squire recouers grace,  
> Sclaunder her guests doth staine:  
> Corflambo chaseth Placidas,  
> And is by Arthure slaine.*

> W Ell said the wiseman, now prou'd true by this,  
> Which to this gentle Squire did happen late.  
> That the displeasure of the mighty is  
> Then death it selfe more dread and desperate.  
> For naught the same may calme ne mitigate,  
> Till time the tempest doe thereof delay  
> With sufferaunce soft, which rigour can abate,  
> And haue the sterne remembrance wypt away  
> Of bitter thoughts, which deepe therein infixed lay.
>
> Like as it fell to this vnhappy boy,  
> Whose tender heart the faire *Belphebe* had,  
> With one sterne looke so daunted, that no ioy  
> In all his life, which afterwards he lad,  
> He euer tasted, but with penaunce sad  
> And pensiue sorrow pind and wore away,  
> Ne euer laught, ne once shew'd countenance glad;  
> But alwaies wept and wailed night and day,  
> As blasted bloosme through heat doth languish & decay;
>
> Till on a day, as in his wonted wise  
> His doole he made, there chaunst a turtle Doue  
> To come, where he his dolors did deuise,  
> That likewise late had lost her dearest loue;  
> Which losse her made like passion also proue.  
> Who seeing his sad plight, her tender heart  
> With deare compassion deeply did emmoue,  
> That she gan mone his vndeserued smart,  
> And with her dolefull accent beare with him apart.
>
> Shee sitting by him as on ground he lay,  
> Her mournefull notes full piteously did frame,  
> And thereof made a lamentable lay,  
> So sensibly compyld, that in the same  
> Him seemed oft he heard his owne right name.  
> With that he forth would poure so plenteous teares,  
> And beat his breast vnworthy of such blame,  
> And knocke his head, and rend his rugged heares,  
> That could haue perst the hearts of Tigres & of Beares.
>
> Thus long this gentle bird to him did vse,  
> Withouten dread of perill to repaire  
> Vnto his wonne, and with her mournefull muse  
> Him to recomfort in his greatest care,  
> That much did ease his mourning and misfare:  
> And euery day for guerdon of her song,  
> He part of his small feast to her would share;  
> That at the last of all his woe and wrong  
> Companion she became, and so continued long.
>
> Vpon a day as she him sate beside,  
> By chance he certaine miniments forth drew,  
> Which yet with him as relickes did abide  
> Of all the bounty, which *Belphebe* threw  
> On him, whilst goodly grace she did him shew:  
> Amongst the rest a iewell rich he found,  
> That was a Ruby of right perfect hew,  
> Shap'd like a heart, yet bleeding of the wound,  
> And with a litle golden chaine about it bound.
>
> The same he tooke, and with a riband new,  
> In which his Ladies colours were, did bind  
> About the turtles necke, that with the vew  
> Did greatly solace his engrieued mind.  
> All vnawares the bird, when she did find  
> Her selfe so deckt, her nimble wings displaid,  
> And flew away, as lightly as the wind:  
> Which sodaine accident him much dismaid,  
> And looking after long, did marke which way she straid.
>
> But when as long he looked had in vaine,  
> Yet saw her forward still to make her flight,  
> His weary eie returnd to him againe,  
> Full of discomfort and disquiet plight,  
> That both his iuell he had lost so light,  
> And eke his deare companion of his care.  
> But that sweet bird departing, flew forth right  
> Through the wide region of the wastfull aire,  
> Vntill she came where wonned his *Belphebe* faire.
>
> There found she her (as then it did betide)  
> Sitting in couert shade of arbors sweet,  
> After late weary toile, which she had tride  
> In saluage chase, to rest as seem'd her meet.  
> There she alighting, fell before her feet,  
> And gan to her her mournfull plaint to make,  
> As was her wont, thinking to let her weet  
> The great tormenting griefe, that for her sake  
> Her gentle Squire through her displeasure did pertake.
>
> She her beholding with attentiue eye,  
> At length did marke about her purple brest  
> That precious iuell, which she formerly  
> Had knowne right well with colourd ribbands drest:  
> Therewith she rose in hast, and her addrest  
> With ready hand it to haue reft away.  
> But the swift bird obayd not her behest,  
> But swaru'd aside, and there againe did stay;  
> She follow'd her, and thought againe it to assay.
>
> And euer when she nigh approcht, the Doue  
> Would flit a litle forward, and then stay,  
> Till she drew neare, and then againe remoue;  
> So tempting her still to pursue the pray,  
> And still from her escaping soft away:  
> Till that at length into that forrest wide,  
> She drew her far, and led with slow delay.  
> In th'end she her vnto that place did guide,  
> Whereas that wofull man in languor did abide.
>
> Eftsoones she flew vnto his fearelesse hand,  
> And there a piteous ditty new deuiz'd,  
> As if she would haue made him vnderstand,  
> His sorrowes cause to be of her despis'd.  
> Whom when she saw in wretched weedes disguiz'd,  
> With heary glib deform'd, and meiger face,  
> Like ghost late risen from his graue agryz'd,  
> She knew him not, but pittied much his case,  
> And wisht it were in her to doe him any grace.
>
> He her beholding, at her feet downe fell,  
> And kist the ground on which her sole did tread,  
> And washt the same with water, which did well  
> From his moist eies, and like two streames procead;  
> Yet spake no word, whereby she might aread  
> What mister wight he was, or what he ment:  
> But as one daunted with her presence dread,  
> Onely few ruefull lookes vnto her sent,  
> As messengers of his true meaning and intent.
>
> Yet nathemore his meaning she ared,  
> But wondred much at his so selcouth case,  
> And by his persons secret seemlyhed  
> Well weend, that he had beene some man of place,  
> Before misfortune did his hew deface:  
> That being mou'd with ruth she thus bespake.  
> Ah wofull man, what heauens hard disgrace,  
> Or wrath of cruell wight on thee ywrake?  
> Or selfe disliked life doth thee thus wretched make?
>
> If heauen, then none may it redresse or blame,  
> Sith to his powre we all are subiect borne:  
> If wrathfull wight, then fowle rebuke and shame  
> Be theirs, that haue so cruell thee forlorne;  
> But if through inward griefe or wilfull scorne  
> Of life it be, then better doe aduise.  
> For he whose daies in wilfull woe are worne,  
> The grace of his Creator doth despise,  
> That will not vse his gifts for thanklesse nigardise.
>
> When so he heard her say, eftsoones he brake  
> His sodaine silence, which he long had pent,  
> And sighing inly deepe, her thus bespake;  
> Then haue they all themselues against me bent:  
> For heauen, first author of my languishment,  
> Enuying my too great felicity,  
> Did closely with a cruell one consent,  
> To cloud my daies in dolefull misery,  
> And make me loath this life, still longing for to die.
>
> Ne any but your selfe, O dearest dred,  
> Hath done this wrong, to wreake on worthlesse wight  
> Your high displesure, through misdeeming bred:  
> That when your pleasure is to deeme aright,  
> Ye may redresse, and me restore to light.  
> Which sory words her mightie hart did mate  
> With mild regard, to see his ruefull plight,  
> That her inburning wrath she gan abate,  
> And him receiu'd againe to former fauours state.
>
> In which he long time afterwards did lead  
> An happie life with grace and good accord,  
> Fearlesse of fortunes chaunge or enuies dread,  
> And eke all mindlesse of his owne deare Lord  
> The noble Prince, who neuer heard one word  
> Of tydings, what did vnto him betide,  
> Or what good fortune did to him afford,  
> But through the endlesse world did wander wide,  
> Him seeking euermore, yet no where him descride.
>
> Till on a day as through that wood he rode,  
> He chaunst to come where those two Ladies late,  
> *AEmylia* and *Amoret* abode,  
> Both in full sad and sorrowfull estate;  
> The one right feeble through the euill rate  
> Of food, which in her duresse she had found:  
> The other almost dead and desperate  
> Through her late hurts, and through that haplesse wound,  
> With which the Squire in her defence her sore astound.
>
> Whom when the Prince beheld, he gan to rew  
> The euill case in which those Ladies lay;  
> But most was moued at the piteous vew  
> Of *Amoret*, so neare vnto decay,  
> That her great daunger did him much dismay.  
> Eftsoones that pretious liquour forth he drew,  
> Which he in store about him kept alway,  
> And with few drops thereof did softly dew  
> Her wounds, that vnto strength restor'd her soone anew.
>
> Tho when they both recouered were right well,  
> He gan of them inquire, what euill guide  
> Them thether brought, and how their harmes befell.  
> To whom they told all, that did them betide,  
> And how from thraldome vile they were vntide  
> Of that same wicked Carle, by Virgins hond;  
> Whose bloudie corse they shew'd him there beside,  
> And eke his caue, in which they both were bond:  
> At which he wondred much, when all those signes he fond.
>
> And euermore he greatly did desire  
> To know, what Virgin did them thence vnbind;  
> And oft of them did earnestly inquire,  
> Where was her won, and how he mote her find.  
> But when as nought according to his mind  
> He could outlearne, he them from ground did reare:  
> No seruice lothsome to a gentle kind;  
> And on his warlike beast them both did beare,  
> Himselfe by them on foot, to succour them from feare.
>
> So when that forrest they had passed well,  
> A litle cotage farre away they spide,  
> To which they drew, ere night vpon them fell;  
> And entring in, found none therein abide,  
> But one old woman sitting there beside,  
> Vpon the ground in ragged rude attyre,  
> With filthy lockes about her scattered wide,  
> Gnawing her nayles for felnesse and for yre,  
> And there out sucking venime to her parts entyre.
>
> A foule and loathly creature sure in sight,  
> And in conditions to be loath'd no lesse:  
> For she was stuft with rancour and despight  
> Vp to the throat, that oft with bitternesse  
> It forth would breake, and gush in great excesse,  
> Pouring out streames of poyson and of gall  
> Gainst all, that truth or vertue doe professe,  
> Whom she with leasings lewdly did miscall,  
> And wickedly backbite: Her name men *Sclaunder* call.
>
> Her nature is all goodnesse to abuse,  
> And causelesse crimes continually to frame,  
> With which she guiltlesse persons may accuse,  
> And steale away the crowne of their good name;  
> Ne euer Knight so bold, ne euer Dame  
> So chast and loyall liu'd, but she would striue  
> With forged cause them falsely to defame;  
> Ne euer thing so well was doen aliue,  
> But she with blame would blot, & of due praise depriue.
>
> Her words were not, as common words are ment,  
> T'expresse the meaning of the inward mind,  
> But noysome breath, and poysnous spirit sent  
> From inward parts, with cancred malice lind,  
> And breathed forth with blast of bitter wind;  
> Which passing through the eares, would pierce the hart,  
> And wound the soule it selfe with griefe vnkind:  
> For like the stings of Aspes, that kill with smart,  
> Her spightfull words did pricke, & wound the inner part.
>
> Such was that Hag, vnmeet to host such guests,  
> Whom greatest Princes court would welcome fayne;  
> But neede, that answers not to all requests,  
> Bad them not looke for better entertayne;  
> And eke that age despysed nicenesse vaine,  
> Enur'd to hardnesse and to homely fare,  
> Which them to warlike discipline did trayne,  
> And manly limbs endur'd with little care  
> Against all hard mishaps and fortunelesse misfare.
>
> Then all that euening welcommed with cold,  
> And chearelesse hunger, they together spent;  
> Yet found no fault, but that the Hag did scold  
> And rayle at them with grudgefull discontent,  
> For lodging there without her owne consent:  
> Yet they endured all with patience milde,  
> And vnto rest themselues all onely lent,  
> Regardlesse of that queane so base and vilde,  
> To be vniustly blamd, and bitterly reuilde.
>
> Here well I weene, when as these rimes be red  
> With misregard, that some rash witted wight,  
> Whose looser thought will lightly be misled,  
> These gentle Ladies will misdeeme too light,  
> For thus conuersing with this noble Knight;  
> Sith now of dayes such temperance is rare  
> And hard to finde, that heat of youthfull spright  
> For ought will from his greedie pleasure spare:  
> More hard for hungry steed t'abstaine from pleasant lare.
>
> But antique age yet in the infancie  
> Of time, did liue then like an innocent,  
> In simple truth and blamelesse chastitie,  
> Ne then of guile had made experiment,  
> But voide of vile and treacherous intent,  
> Held vertue for it selfe in soueraine awe:  
> Then loyall loue had royall regiment,  
> And each vnto his lust did make a lawe,  
> From all forbidden things his liking to withdraw.
>
> The Lyon there did with the Lambe consort,  
> And eke the Doue sate by the Faulcons side,  
> Ne each of other feared fraud or tort,  
> But did in safe securitie abide,  
> Withouten perill of the stronger pride:  
> But when the world woxe old, it woxe warre old  
> (Whereof it hight) and hauing shortly tride  
> The traines of wit, in wickednesse woxe bold,  
> And dared of all sinnes the secrets to vnfold.
>
> Then beautie, which was made to represent  
> The great Creatours owne resemblance bright,  
> Vnto abuse of lawlesse lust was lent,  
> And made the baite of bestiall delight:  
> Then faire grew foule, and foule grew faire in sight,  
> And that which wont to vanquish God and man,  
> Was made the vassall of the victors might;  
> Then did her glorious flowre wex dead and wan,  
> Despisd and troden downe of all that ouerran.
>
> And now it is so vtterly decayd,  
> That any bud thereof doth scarse remaine,  
> But if few plants preseru'd through heauenly ayd,  
> In Princes Court doe hap to sprout againe,  
> Dew'd with her drops of bountie Soueraine,  
> Which from that goodly glorious flowre proceed,  
> Sprung of the auncient stocke of Princes straine,  
> Now th'onely remnant of that royall breed,  
> Whose noble kind at first was sure of heauenly seed.
>
> Tho soone as day discouered heauens face  
> To sinfull men with darknes ouerdight,  
> This gentle crew gan from their eye-lids chace  
> The drowzie humour of the dampish night,  
> And did themselues vnto their iourney dight.  
> So forth they yode, and forward softly paced,  
> That them to view had bene an vncouth sight;  
> How all the way the Prince on footpace traced,  
> The Ladies both on horse, together fast embraced.
>
> Soone as they thence departed were afore,  
> That shamefull Hag, the slaunder of her sexe,  
> Them follow'd fast, and them reuiled sore,  
> Him calling theefe, them whores; that much did vexe  
> His noble hart; thereto she did annexe  
> False crimes and facts, such as they neuer ment,  
> That those two Ladies much asham'd did wexe:  
> The more did she pursue her lewd intent,  
> And rayl'd and rag'd, till she had all her poyson spent.
>
> At last when they were passed out of sight,  
> Yet she did not her spightfull speach forbeare,  
> But after them did barke, and still backbite,  
> Though there were none her hatefull words to heare:  
> Like as a curre doth felly bite and teare  
> The stone, which passed straunger at him threw;  
> So she them seeing past the reach of eare,  
> Against the stones and trees did rayle anew,  
> Till she had duld the sting, which in her tongs end grew.
>
> They passing forth kept on their readie way,  
> With easie steps so soft as foot could stryde.  
> Both for great feeblesse, which did oft assay  
> Faire *Amoret*, that scarcely she could ryde;  
> And eke through heauie armes, which sore annoyd  
> The Prince on foot, not wonted so to fare;  
> Whose steadie hand was faine his steede to guyde,  
> And all the way from trotting hard to spare,  
> So was his toyle the more, the more that was his care.
>
> At length they spide, where towards them with speed  
> A Squire came gallopping, as he would flie;  
> Bearing a litle Dwarfe before his steed,  
> That all the way full loud for aide did crie,  
> That seem'd his shrikes would rend the brasen skie:  
> Whom after did a mightie man pursew,  
> Ryding vpon a Dromedare on hie,  
> Of stature huge, and horrible of hew,  
> That would haue maz'd a man his dreadfull face to vew.
>
> For from his fearefull eyes two fierie beames,  
> More sharpe then points of needles did proceede,  
> Shooting forth farre away two flaming streames,  
> Full of sad powre, that poysonous bale did breede  
> To all, that on him lookt without good heed,  
> And secretly his enemies did slay:  
> Like as the Basiliske of serpents seede,  
> From powrefull eyes close venim doth conuay  
> Into the lookers hart, and killeth farre away.
>
> He all the way did rage at that same Squire,  
> And after him full many threatnings threw,  
> With curses vaine in his auengefull ire:  
> But none of them (so fast away he flew)  
> Him ouertooke, before he came in vew.  
> Where when he saw the Prince in armour bright,  
> He cald to him aloud, his case to rew,  
> And rescue him through succour of his might,  
> From that his cruell foe, that him pursewd in sight.
>
> Eftsoones the Prince tooke downe those Ladies twaine  
> From loftie steede, and mounting in their stead  
> Came to that Squire, yet trembling euery vaine:  
> Of whom he gan enquire his cause of dread;  
> Who as he gan the same to him aread,  
> Loe hard behind his backe his foe was prest,  
> With dreadfull weapon aymed at his head;  
> That vnto death had doen him vnredrest,  
> Had not the noble Prince his readie stroke represt.
>
> Who thrusting boldly twixt him and the blow,  
> The burden of the deadly brunt did beare  
> Vpon his shield, which lightly he did throw  
> Ouer his head, before the harme came neare.  
> Nathlesse it fell with so despiteous dreare  
> And heauie sway, that hard vnto his crowne  
> The shield it droue, and did the couering reare:  
> Therewith both Squire and dwarfe did tomble downe  
> Vnto the earth, and lay long while in senselesse swowne.
>
> Whereat the Prince full wrath, his strong right hand  
> In full auengement heaued vp on hie,  
> And stroke the Pagan with his steely brand  
> So sore, that to his saddle bow thereby  
> He bowed low, and so a while did lie:  
> And sure had not his massie yron mace  
> Betwixt him and his hurt bene happily,  
> It would haue cleft him to the girding place,  
> Yet as it was, it did astonish him long space.
>
> But when he to himselfe returnd againe,  
> All full of rage he gan to curse and sweare,  
> And vow by *Mahoune* that he should be slaine.  
> With that his murdrous mace he vp did reare,  
> That seemed nought the souse thereof could beare,  
> And therewith smote at him with all his might.  
> But ere that it to him approched neare,  
> The royall child with readie quicke foresight,  
> Did shun the proofe thereof and it auoyded light.
>
> But ere his hand he could recure againe,  
> To ward his bodie from the balefull stound,  
> He smote at him with all his might and maine,  
> So furiously, that ere he wist, he found  
> His head before him tombling on the ground.  
> The whiles his babling tongue did yet blaspheme  
> And curse his God, that did him so confound;  
> The whiles his life ran foorth in bloudie streame,  
> His soule descended downe into the Stygian reame.
>
> Which when that Squire beheld, he woxe full glad  
> To see his foe breath out his spright in vaine:  
> But that same dwarfe right sorie seem'd and sad,  
> And howld aloud to see his Lord there slaine,  
> And rent his haire and scratcht his face for paine.  
> Then gan the Prince at leasure to inquire  
> Of all the accident, there hapned plaine,  
> And what he was, whose eyes did flame with fire;  
> All which was thus to him declared by that Squire.
>
> This mightie man (quoth he) whom you haue slaine,  
> Of an huge Geauntesse whylome was bred;  
> And by his strength rule to himselfe did gaine  
> Of many Nations into thraldome led,  
> And mightie kingdomes of his force adred;  
> Whom yet he conquer'd not by bloudie fight,  
> Ne hostes of men with banners brode dispred,  
> But by the powre of his infectious sight,  
> With which he killed all, that came within his might.
>
> Ne was he euer vanquished afore,  
> But euer vanquisht all, with whom he fought;  
> Ne was there man so strong, but he downe bore,  
> Ne woman yet so faire, but he her brought  
> Vnto his bay, and captiued her thought.  
> For most of strength and beautie his desire  
> Was spoyle to make, and wast them vnto nought,  
> By casting secret flakes of lustfull fire  
> From his false eyes, into their harts and parts entire.
>
> Therefore *Corflambo* was he cald aright,  
> Though namelesse there his bodie now doth lie,  
> Yet hath he left one daughter that is hight  
> The faire *Poeana*; who seemes outwardly  
> So faire, as euer yet saw liuing eie:  
> And were her vertue like her beautie bright,  
> She were as faire as any vnder skie.  
> But ah she giuen is to vaine delight,  
> And eke too loose of life, and eke of loue too light.
>
> So as it fell there was a gentle Squire,  
> That lou'd a Ladie of high parentage;  
> But for his meane degree might not aspire  
> To match so high, her friends with counsell sage,  
> Dissuaded her from such a disparage.  
> But she, whose hart to loue was wholly lent,  
> Out of his hands could not redeeme her gage,  
> But firmely following her first intent,  
> Resolu'd with him to wend, gainst all her friends consent.
>
> So twixt themselues they pointed time and place,  
> To which when he according did repaire,  
> An hard mishap and disauentrous case  
> Him chaunst; in stead of his *Æmylia* faire  
> This Gyants sonne, that lies there on the laire  
> An headlesse heape, him vnawares there caught,  
> And all dismayd through mercilesse despaire,  
> Him wretched thrall vnto his dongeon brought,  
> Where he remaines, of all vnsuccour'd and vnsought.
>
> This Gyants daughter came vpon a day  
> Vnto the prison in her ioyous glee,  
> To view the thrals, which there in bondage lay:  
> Amongst the rest she chaunced there to see  
> This louely swaine the Squire of low degree;  
> To whom she did her liking lightly cast,  
> And wooed him her paramour to bee:  
> From day to day she woo'd and prayd him fast,  
> And for his loue him promist libertie at last.
>
> He though affide vnto a former loue,  
> To whom his faith he firmely ment to hold,  
> Yet seeing not how thence he mote remoue,  
> But by that meanes, which fortune did vnfold,  
> Her graunted loue, but with affection cold  
> To win her grace his libertie to get.  
> Yet she him still detaines in captiue hold  
> Fearing least if she should him freely set,  
> He would her shortly leaue, and former loue forget.
>
> Yet so much fauour she to him hath hight,  
> Aboue the rest, that he sometimes may space  
> And walke about her gardens of delight,  
> Hauing a keeper still with him in place;  
> Which keeper is this Dwarfe, her dearling base,  
> To whom the keyes of euery prison dore  
> By her committed be, of speciall grace,  
> And at his will may whom he list restore,  
> And whom he list reserue, to be afflicted more.
>
> Whereof when tydings came vnto mine eare,  
> Full inly sorie for the feruent zeale,  
> Which I to him as to my soule did beare;  
> I thether went where I did long conceale  
> My selfe, till that the Dwarfe did me reueale,  
> And told his Dame, her Squire of low degree  
> Did secretly out of her prison steale;  
> For me he did mistake that Squire to be;  
> For neuer two so like did liuing creature see.
>
> Then was I taken and before her brought:  
> Who through the likenesse of my outward hew,  
> Being likewise beguiled in her thought,  
> Gan blame me much for being so vntrew,  
> To seeke by flight her fellowship t'eschew,  
> That lou'd me deare, as dearest thing aliue.  
> Thence she commaunded me to prison new;  
> Whereof I glad did not gainesay nor striue,  
> But suffred that same Dwarfe me to her dongeon driue.
>
> There did I finde mine onely faithfull frend  
> In heauy plight and sad perplexitie;  
> Whereof I sorie, yet my selfe did bend,  
> Him to recomfort with my companie.  
> But him the more agreeu'd I found thereby:  
> For all his ioy, he said, in that distresse  
> Was mine and his *Æmylias* libertie.  
> *Æmylia* well he lou'd, as I mote ghesse;  
> Yet greater loue to me then her he did professe.
>
> But I with better reason him auiz'd,  
> And shew'd him how through error and mis-thought  
> Of our like persons eath to be disguiz'd,  
> Or his exchange, or freedome might be wrought.  
> Whereto full loth was he, ne would for ought  
> Consent, that I who stood all fearelesse free,  
> Should wilfully be into thraldome brought,  
> Till fortune did perforce it so decree.  
> Yet ouerrul'd at last, he did to me agree.
>
> The morrow next about the wonted howre,  
> The Dwarfe cald at the doore of *Amyas*,  
> To come forthwith vnto his Ladies bowre.  
> In steed of whom forth came I *Placidas*,  
> And vndiscerned, forth with him did pas.  
> There with great ioyance and with gladsome glee,  
> Of faire *Poeana* I receiued was,  
> And oft imbrast, as if that I were hee,  
> And with kind words accoyd, vowing great loue to mee.
>
> Which I, that was not bent to former loue,  
> As was my friend, that had her long refusd,  
> Did well accept, as well it did behoue,  
> And to the present neede it wisely vsd.  
> My former hardnesse first I faire excusd;  
> And after promist large amends to make.  
> With such smooth termes her error I abusd,  
> To my friends good, more then for mine owne sake,  
> For whose sole libertie I loue and life did stake.
>
> Thenceforth I found more fauour at her hand,  
> That to her Dwarfe, which had me in his charge,  
> She bad to lighten my too heauie band,  
> And graunt more scope to me to walke at large.  
> So on a day as by the flowrie marge  
> Of a fresh streame I with that Elfe did play,  
> Finding no meanes how I might vs enlarge,  
> But if that Dwarfe I could with me conuay,  
> I lightly snatcht him vp, and with me bore away.
>
> Thereat he shriekt aloud, that with his cry  
> The Tyrant selfe came forth with yelling bray,  
> And me pursew'd; but nathemore would I  
> Forgoe the purchase of my gotten pray,  
> But haue perforce him hether brought away.  
> Thus as they talked, loe where nigh at hand  
> Those Ladies two yet doubtfull through dismay  
> In presence came, desirous t'vnderstand  
> Tydings of all, which there had hapned on the land.
>
> Where soone as sad *Æmylia* did espie  
> Her captiue louers friend, young *Placidas*:  
> All mindlesse of her wonted modestie,  
> She to him ran, and him with streight embras  
> Enfolding said, And liues yet *Amyas*?  
> He liues (quoth he) and his *Æmylia* loues.  
> Then lesse (said she) by all the woe I pas,  
> With which my weaker patience fortune proues.  
> But what mishap thus long him fro my selfe remoues?
>
> Then gan he all this storie to renew,  
> And tell the course of his captiuitie;  
> That her deare hart full deepely made to rew,  
> And sigh full sore, to heare the miserie,  
> In which so long he mercilesse did lie.  
> Then after many teares and sorrowes spent,  
> She deare besought the Prince of remedie:  
> Who thereto did with readie will consent,  
> And well perform'd, as shall appeare by his euent.
