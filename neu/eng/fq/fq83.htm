<p>A Vision vpon this
conceipt of the
<i>Faery Queene.</i></center>

<blockquote>ME
thought I saw the graue where <i>Laura</i> lay
<br>Within that Temple, where the vestall
flame
<br>Was wont to burne, and passing by
that way,
<br>To see that buried dust of liuing
fame,
<br>Whose tombe faire loue, and fairer
vertue kept,
<br>All suddenly I saw the Faery Queene:
<br>At whose approch the soule of <i>Petrarke</i>
wept,
<br>And from thenceforth those graces
were not seene.
<br>For they this Queene attended, in
whose steed
<br>Obliuion laid him downe on <i>Lauras</i>
herse:
<br>Hereat the hardest stones were seene
to bleed,
<br>And grones of buried ghostes the
heuens did perse.
<br>Where <i>Homers</i> spright did
tremble all for griefe,
<br>And curst th'accesse of that celestiall
theife.

<blockquote><i>THe
prayse of meaner wits this worke like profit brings,</i>
<br><i>As doth the Cuckoes song delight
when Philumena sings.</i>
<br><i>If thou hast formed right true
vertues face herein:</i>
<br><i>Vertue her selfe can best discerne,
to whom they writen bin.</i>
<br><i>If thou hast beauty praysd, let
her sole looks diuine</i>
<br><i>Iudge if ought therein be amis,
and mend it by her meine.</i>
<br><i>If Chastitie want ought, or Temperaunce
her dew,</i>
<br><i>Behold her Princely mind aright,
and write thy Queene anew.</i>
<br><i>Meane while she shall perceiue,
how far her vertues sore</i>
<br><i>Aboue the reach of all that liue,
or such as wrote of yore:</i>
<br><i>And thereby will excuse and fauour
thy good will:</i>
<br><i>Whose vertue can not be exprest,
but by an Angels quill.</i>
<br><i>Of me no lines are lou'd, nor
letters are of price,</i>
<br><i>Of all which speak our English
tongue, but those of thy deuice.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>COllyn
I see by thy new taken taske,</i>
<br><i>some sacred fury hath enricht
thy braynes,</i>

verse to maske,</i>
<br><i>and loath the layes that longs

<br><i>Thy chaunged hart now holdes
thy pypes in scorne,</i>
<br><i>those prety pypes that did thy
mates delight.</i>
<br><i>Those trustie mates, that loued
thee so well,</i>
<br><i>VVhom thou gau'st mirth: as they
gaue thee the bell.</i>
<p><i>&nbsp;Yet as thou earst with thy
sweete roundelayes,</i>
<br><i>didst stirre to glee our laddes
in homely bowers:</i>
<br><i>So moughtst thou now in these
refyned layes,</i>
<br><i>delight the daintie eares of
higher powers.</i>
<br><i>And so mought they in their deepe
skanning skill</i>
<br><i>Alow and grace our Collyns flowing
quill.</i>
<p><i>&nbsp;And fare befall that </i>Faery
Queene<i> of thine,</i>
<br><i>in whose faire eyes loue linckt
with vertue sites:</i>
<br><i>Enfusing by those bewties fyers
deuine,</i>
<br><i>such high conceites into thy
humble wits,</i>
<br><i>As raised hath poore pastors
oaten reede,</i>
<br><i>From rustick tunes, to chaunt

<br><i>victorious be in that faire Ilands
right:</i>
<br><i>Which thou dost vaile in Type
of Faery land</i>
<br><i>Elyzaes blessed field, that </i>Albion<i>
hight.</i>
<br><i>That shieldes her friends, and
warres her mightie foes,</i>
<br><i>Yet still with people, peace,
and plentie flowes.</i>
<p><i>&nbsp;But (iolly Shepheard) though
with pleasing style,</i>
<br><i>thou feast the humour of the
Courtly traine:</i>
<br><i>Let not conceipt thy setled sence
beguile,</i>
<br><i>ne daunted be through enuy or
disdaine.</i>
<br><i>Subiect thy dome to her Empyring
spright,</i>

playes:
<br>Nere thy sweet bankes, there liues
that sacred crowne,
<br>Whose hand strowes Palme and neuer-dying

<br>Let all at once with thy soft murmuring

<br>Present her with this worthy Poets

<blockquote>WHen
stout <i>Achilles</i> heard of <i>Helen's</i> rape
<br>And what reuenge the States of Greece
deuisd:
<br>Thinking by sleight the fatall warres
to scape,
<br>In womens weedes him selfe he then
disguisde.
<br>But this deuise <i>Vlysses</i> soone
did spy,
<br>And brought him forth, the chaunce
of warre to try.
<p>&nbsp;When <i>Spencer</i> saw the
fame was spredd so large
<br>Through Faery land of their renowned
Queene:
<br>Loth that his Muse should take so
great a charge,
<br>As in such haughty matter to be
seene,
<br>To seeme a Shepeheard then he made
his choice,
<br>But <i>Sidney</i> heard him sing,
and knew his voice.
<p>&nbsp;And as <i>Vlysses</i> brought
faire <i>Thetis</i> sonne
<br>From his retyred life to menage
armes:
<br>So <i>Spencer</i> was by <i>Sidneys</i>
speaches wonne,
<br>To blaze her fame not fearing future
harmes:
<br>For well he knew, his Muse would
soone be tyred
<br>In her high praise, that all the
world admired.
<p>&nbsp;Yet as <i>Achilles</i> in those
warlike frayes,
<br>Did win the palme from all the <i>Grecian</i>
Peeres:
<br>So <i>Spencer</i> now to his immortall
prayse,
<br>Hath wonne the Laurell quite from
all his feres.
<br>What though his taske exceed a humaine
witt
<br>He is excus'd, sith <i>Sidney</i>
thought it fitt.</blockquote>

<p><i>&nbsp;To labour to commend a peece
of worke,</i>
<br><i>Which no man goes about to discommend,</i>
<br><i>Would raise a iealous doubt that

<br><i>I here pronounce this workmanship
is such,</i>
<br><i>As that no pen can set it forth
too much.</i>
<p><i>&nbsp;And thus I hang a garland

<br><i>Not for to shew the goodnes of

<p><i>To the right honourable the Earle</i>
<br><i>of Cumberland.</i></center>

<blockquote>REdoubted
Lord, in whose corageous mind
<br>The flowre of cheualry now bloosming
faire,
<br>Doth promise fruite worthy the noble
kind
<br>Which of their praises haue left
you the haire;
<br>To you this humble present I prepare,
<br>For loue of vertue and of Martiall
praise;
<br>To which though nobly ye inclined
are,
<br>As goodlie well ye shew'd in late
assaies,
<br>Yet braue ensample of long passed
daies,
<br>In which trew honor ye may fashioned
see,
<br>To like desire of honor may ye raise,
<br>And fill your mind with magnanimitee.
<br>Receiue it, Lord, therefore, as
it was ment,
<br>For honor of your name and high
descent.</blockquote>
