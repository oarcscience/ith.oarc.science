*Cant. XII.*

> *Faire Vna to the Redcrosse knight  
> betrouthed is with ioy:  
> Though false Duessa it to barre  
> her false sleights doe imploy.*

> BEhold I see the hauen nigh at hand,  
> To which I meane my wearie course to bend;  
> Vere the maine shete, and beare vp with the land,  
> The which afore is fairely to be kend,  
> And seemeth safe from stormes, that may offend;  
> There this faire virgin wearie of her way  
> Must landed be, now at her iourneyes end:  
> There eke my feeble barke a while may stay,  
> Till merry wind and weather call her thence away.
>
> Scarsely had *Phoebus* in the glooming East  
> Yet harnessed his firie-footed teeme,  
> Ne reard aboue the earth his flaming creast,  
> When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme,  
> That signe of last outbreathed life did seeme,  
> Vnto the watchman on the castle wall;  
> Who thereby dead that balefull Beast did deeme,  
> And to his Lord and Ladie lowd gan call,  
> To tell, how he had seene the Dragons fatall fall.
>
> Vprose with hastie ioy, and feeble speed  
> That aged Sire, the Lord of all that land,  
> And looked forth, to weet, if true indeede  
> Those tydings were, as he did vnderstand,  
> Which whenas true by tryall he out fond,  
> He bad to open wyde his brazen gate,  
> Which long time had bene shut, and out of hond  
> Proclaymed ioy and peace through all his state;  
> For dead now was their foe, which them forrayed late.
>
> Then gan triumphant Trompets sound on hie,  
> That sent to heauen the ecchoed report  
> Of their new ioy, and happie victorie  
> Gainst him, that had them long opprest with tort,  
> And fast imprisoned in sieged fort.  
> Then all the people, as in solemne feast,  
> To him assembled with one full consort,  
> Reioycing at the fall of that great beast,  
> From whose eternall bondage now they were releast.
>
> Forth came that auncient Lord and aged Queene,  
> Arayd in antique robes downe to the ground,  
> And sad habiliments right well beseene;  
> A noble crew about them waited round  
> Of sage and sober Peres, all grauely gownd;  
> Whom farre before did march a goodly band  
> Of tall young men, all hable armes to sownd,  
> But now they laurell braunches bore in hand;  
> Glad signe of victorie and peace in all their land.
>
> Vnto that doughtie Conquerour they came,  
> And him before themselues prostrating low,  
> Their Lord and Patrone loud did him proclame,  
> And at his feet their laurell boughes did throw.  
> Soone after them all dauncing on a row  
> The comely virgins came, with girlands dight,  
> As fresh as flowres in medow greene do grow,  
> When morning deaw vpon their leaues doth light:  
> And in their hands sweet Timbrels all vpheld on hight.
>
> And them before, the fry of children young  
> Their wanton sports and childish mirth did play,  
> And to the Maydens sounding tymbrels sung  
> In well attuned notes, a ioyous lay,  
> And made delightfull musicke all the way,  
> Vntill they came, where that faire virgin stood;  
> As faire *Diana* in fresh sommers day  
> Beholds her Nymphes, enraung'd in shadie wood,  
> Some wrestle, some do run, some bathe in christall flood.
>
> So she beheld those maydens meriment  
> With chearefull vew; who when to her they came,  
> Themselues to ground with gratious humblesse bent,  
> And her ador'd by honorable name,  
> Lifting to heauen her euerlasting fame:  
> Then on her head they set a girland greene,  
> And crowned her twixt earnest and twixt game;  
> Who in her selfe-resemblance well beseene,  
> Did seeme such, as she was, a goodly maiden Queene.
>
> And after, all the raskall many ran,  
> Heaped together in rude rablement  
> To see the face of that victorious man:  
> Whom all admired, as from heauen sent,  
> And gazd vpon with gaping wonderment.  
> But when they came, where that dead Dragon lay,  
> Stretcht on the ground in monstrous large extent,  
> The sight with idle feare did them dismay,  
> Ne durst approch him nigh, to touch, or once assay.
>
> Some feard, and fled; some feard and well it faynd;  
> One that would wiser seeme, then all the rest,  
> Warnd him not touch, for yet perhaps remaynd  
> Some lingring life within his hollow brest,  
> Or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest  
> Of many Dragonets, his fruitfull seed;  
> Another said, that in his eyes did rest  
> Yet sparckling fire, and bad thereof take heed;  
> Another said, he saw him moue his eyes indeed.
>
> One mother, when as her foolehardie chyld  
> Did come too neare, and with his talants play,  
> Halfe dead through feare, her litle babe reuyld,  
> And to her gossips gan in counsell say;  
> How can I tell, but that his talants may  
> Yet scratch my sonne, or rend his tender hand?  
> So diuersly themselues in vaine they fray;  
> Whiles some more bold, to measure him nigh stand,  
> To proue how many acres he did spread of land.
>
> Thus flocked all the folke him round about,  
> The whiles that hoarie king, with all his traine,  
> Being arriued, where that champion stout  
> After his foes defeasance did remaine,  
> Him goodly greetes, and faire does entertaine,  
> With princely gifts of yuorie and gold,  
> And thousand thankes him yeelds for all his paine.  
> Then when his daughter deare he does behold,  
> Her dearely doth imbrace, and kisseth manifold.
>
> And after to his Pallace he them brings,  
> With shaumes, & trompets, & with Clarions sweet;  
> And all the way the ioyous people sings,  
> And with their garments strowes the paued street:  
> Whence mounting vp, they find purueyance meet  
> Of all, that royall Princes court became,  
> And all the floore was vnderneath their feet  
> Bespred with costly scarlot of great name,  
> On which they lowly sit, and fitting purpose frame.
>
> What needs me tell their feast and goodly guize,  
> In which was nothing riotous nor vaine?  
> What needs of daintie dishes to deuize,  
> Of comely seruices, or courtly trayne?  
> My narrow leaues cannot in them containe  
> The large discourse of royall Princes state.  
> Yet was their manner then but bare and plaine:  
> For th'antique world excesse and pride did hate;  
> Such proud luxurious pompe is swollen vp but late.
>
> Then when with meates and drinkes of euery kinde  
> Their feruent appetites they quenched had,  
> That auncient Lord gan fit occasion finde,  
> Of straunge aduentures, and of perils sad,  
> Which in his trauell him befallen had,  
> For to demaund of his renowmed guest:  
> Who then with vtt'rance graue, and count'nance sad  
> From point to point, as is before exprest,  
> Discourst his voyage long, according his request.
>
> Great pleasure mixt with pittifull regard,  
> That godly King and Queene did passionate,  
> Whiles they his pittifull aduentures heard,  
> That oft they did lament his lucklesse state,  
> And often blame the too importune fate,  
> That heapd on him so many wrathfull wreakes:  
> For neuer gentle knight, as he of late,  
> So tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes;  
> And all the while salt teares bedeawd the hearers cheaks.
>
> Then said that royall Pere in sober wise;  
> Deare Sonne, great beene the euils, which ye bore  
> From first to last in your late enterprise,  
> That I note, whether prayse, or pitty more:  
> For neuer liuing man, I weene, so sore  
> In sea of deadly daungers was distrest;  
> But since now safe ye seised haue the shore,  
> And well arriued are, (high God be blest)  
> Let vs deuize of ease and euerlasting rest.
>
> Ah dearest Lord, said then that doughty knight,  
> Of ease or rest I may not yet deuize;  
> For by the faith, which I to armes haue plight,  
> I bounden am streight after this emprize,  
> As that your daughter can ye well aduize,  
> Backe to returne to that great Faerie Queene,  
> And her to serue six yeares in warlike wize,  
> Gainst that proud Paynim king, that workes her teene:  
> Therefore I ought craue pardon, till I there haue beene.
>
> Vnhappie falles that hard necessitie,  
> (Quoth he) the troubler of my happie peace,  
> And vowed foe of my felicitie;  
> Ne I against the same can iustly preace:  
> But since that band ye cannot now release,  
> Nor doen vndo; (for vowes may not be vaine)  
> Soone as the terme of those six yeares shall cease,  
> Ye then shall hither backe returne againe,  
> The marriage to accomplish vowd betwixt you twain.
>
> Which for my part I couet to performe,  
> In sort as through the world I did proclame,  
> That who so kild that monster most deforme,  
> And him in hardy battaile ouercame,  
> Should haue mine onely daughter to his Dame,  
> And of my kingdome heire apparaunt bee:  
> Therefore since now to thee perteines the same,  
> By dew desert of noble cheualree,  
> Both daughter and eke kingdome, lo I yield to thee.
>
> Then forth he called that his daughter faire,  
> The fairest *Vn'* his onely daughter deare,  
> His onely daughter, and his onely heyre;  
> Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare,  
> As bright as doth the morning starre appeare  
> Out of the East, with flaming lockes bedight,  
> To tell that dawning day is drawing neare,  
> And to the world does bring long wished light;  
> So faire and fresh that Lady shewd her selfe in sight.
>
> So faire and fresh, as freshest flowre in May;  
> For she had layd her mournefull stole aside,  
> And widow-like sad wimple throwne away,  
> Wherewith her heauenly beautie she did hide,  
> Whiles on her wearie iourney she did ride;  
> And on her now a garment she did weare,  
> All lilly white, withoutten spot, or pride,  
> That seemd like silke and siluer wouen neare,  
> But neither silke nor siluer therein did appeare.
>
> The blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame,  
> And glorious light of her sunshyny face  
> To tell, were as to striue against the streame.  
> My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace,  
> Her heauenly lineaments for to enchace.  
> Ne wonder; for her owne deare loued knight,  
> All were she dayly with himselfe in place,  
> Did wonder much at her celestiall sight:  
> Oft had he seene her faire, but neuer so faire dight.
>
> So fairely dight, when she in presence came,  
> She to her Sire made humble reuerence,  
> And bowed low, that her right well became,  
> And added grace vnto her excellence:  
> Who with great wisedome, and graue eloquence  
> Thus gan to say. But eare he thus had said,  
> With flying speede, and seeming great pretence,  
> Came running in, much like a man dismaid,  
> A Messenger with letters, which his message said.
>
> All in the open hall amazed stood,  
> At suddeinnesse of that vnwarie sight,  
> And wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood.  
> But he for nought would stay his passage right,  
> Till fast before the king he did alight;  
> Where falling flat, great humblesse he did make,  
> And kist the ground, whereon his foot was pight;  
> Then to his hands that writ he did betake,  
> Which he disclosing, red thus, as the paper spake.
>
> To thee, most mighty king of *Eden* faire,  
> Her greeting sends in these sad lines addrest,  
> The wofull daughter, and forsaken heire  
> Of that great Emperour of all the West;  
> And bids thee be aduized for the best,  
> Ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band  
> Of wedlocke to that new vnknowen guest:  
> For he already plighted his right hand  
> Vnto another loue, and to another land.
>
> To me sad mayd, or rather widow sad,  
> He was affiaunced long time before,  
> And sacred pledges he both gaue, and had,  
> False erraunt knight, infamous, and forswore:  
> Witnesse the burning Altars, which he swore,  
> And guiltie heauens of his bold periury,  
> Which though he hath polluted oft of yore,  
> Yet I to them for iudgement iust do fly,  
> And them coniure t'auenge this shamefull iniury.
>
> Therefore since mine he is, or free or bond,  
> Or false or trew, or liuing or else dead,  
> Withhold, O soueraine Prince, your hasty hond  
> From knitting league with him, I you aread;  
> Ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread,  
> Through weakenesse of my widowhed, or woe:  
> For truth is strong, her rightfull cause to plead,  
> And shall find friends, if need requireth soe,  
> So bids thee well to fare, Thy neither friend, nor foe, *Fidessa*.
>
> When he these bitter byting words had red,  
> The tydings straunge did him abashed make,  
> That still he sate long time astonished  
> As in great muse, ne word to creature spake.  
> At last his solemne silence thus he brake,  
> With doubtfull eyes fast fixed on his guest;  
> Redoubted knight, that for mine onely sake  
> Thy life and honour late aduenturest,  
> Let nought be hid from me, that ought to be exprest.
>
> What meane these bloudy vowes, and idle threats,  
> Throwne out from womanish impatient mind?  
> What heauens? what altars? what enraged heates  
> Here heaped vp with termes of loue vnkind,  
> My conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind?  
> High God be witnesse, that I guiltlesse ame.  
> But if your selfe, Sir knight, ye faultie find,  
> Or wrapped be in loues of former Dame,  
> With crime do not it couer, but disclose the same.
>
> To whom the *Redcrosse* knight this answere sent,  
> My Lord, my King, be nought hereat dismayd,  
> Till well ye wote by graue intendiment,  
> What woman, and wherefore doth me vpbrayd  
> With breach of loue, and loyalty betrayd.  
> It was in my mishaps, as hitherward  
> I lately traueild, that vnwares I strayd  
> Out of my way, through perils straunge and hard;  
> That day should faile me, ere I had them all declard.
>
> There did I find, or rather I was found  
> Of this false woman, that *Fidessa* hight,  
> *Fidessa* hight the falsest Dame on ground,  
> Most false *Duessa*, royall richly dight,  
> That easie was t'inuegle weaker sight:  
> Who by her wicked arts, and wylie skill,  
> Too false and strong for earthly skill or might,  
> Vnwares me wrought vnto her wicked will,  
> And to my foe betrayd, when least I feared ill.
>
> Then stepped forth the goodly royall Mayd,  
> And on the ground her selfe prostrating low,  
> With sober countenaunce thus to him sayd;  
> O pardon me, my soueraigne Lord, to show  
> The secret treasons, which of late I know  
> To haue bene wroght by that false sorceresse.  
> She onely she it is, that earst did throw  
> This gentle knight into so great distresse,  
> That death him did awaite in dayly wretchednesse.
>
> And now it seemes, that she suborned hath  
> This craftie messenger with letters vaine,  
> To worke new woe and improuided scath,  
> By breaking of the band betwixt vs twaine;  
> Wherein she vsed hath the practicke paine  
> Of this false footman, clokt with simplenesse,  
> Whom if ye please for to discouer plaine,  
> Ye shall him *Archimago* find, I ghesse,  
> The falsest man aliue; who tries shall find no lesse.
>
> The king was greatly moued at her speach,  
> And all with suddein indignation fraight,  
> Bad on that Messenger rude hands to reach.  
> Eftsoones the Gard, which on his state did wait,  
> Attacht that faitor false, and bound him strait:  
> Who seeming sorely chauffed at his band,  
> As chained Beare, whom cruell dogs do bait,  
> With idle force did faine them to withstand,  
> And often semblaunce made to scape out of their hand.
>
> But they him layd full low in dungeon deepe,  
> And bound him hand and foote with yron chains.  
> And with continuall watch did warely keepe;  
> Who then would thinke, that by his subtile trains  
> He could escape fowle death or deadly paines?  
> Thus when that Princes wrath was pacifide,  
> He gan renew the late forbidden banes,  
> And to the knight his daughter deare he tyde,  
> With sacred rites and vowes for euer to abyde.
>
> His owne two hands the holy knots did knit,  
> That none but death for euer can deuide;  
> His owne two hands, for such a turne most fit,  
> The housling fire did kindle and prouide,  
> And holy water thereon sprinckled wide;  
> At which the bushy Teade a groome did light,  
> And sacred lampe in secret chamber hide,  
> Where it should not be quenched day nor night,  
> For feare of euill fates, but burnen euer bright.
>
> Then gan they sprinckle all the posts with wine,  
> And made great feast to solemnize that day;  
> They all perfumde with frankincense diuine,  
> And precious odours fetcht from far away,  
> That all the house did sweat with great aray:  
> And all the while sweete Musicke did apply  
> Her curious skill, the warbling notes to play,  
> To driue away the dull Melancholy;  
> The whiles one sung a song of loue and iollity.
>
> During the which there was an heauenly noise  
> Heard sound through all the Pallace pleasantly,  
> Like as it had bene many an Angels voice,  
> Singing before th'eternall maiesty,  
> In their trinall triplicities on hye;  
> Yet wist no creature, whence that heauenly sweet  
> Proceeded, yet each one felt secretly  
> Himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet,  
> And rauished with rare impression in his sprite.
>
> Great ioy was made that day of young and old,  
> And solemne feast proclaimd throughout the land,  
> That their exceeding merth may not be told:  
> Suffice it heare by signes to vnderstand  
> The vsuall ioyes at knitting of loues band.  
> Thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold,  
> Possessed of his Ladies hart and hand,  
> And euer, when his eye did her behold,  
> His heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold.
>
> Her ioyous presence and sweet company  
> In full content he there did long enioy,  
> Ne wicked enuie, ne vile gealosy  
> His deare delights were able to annoy:  
> Yet swimming in that sea of blisfull ioy,  
> He nought forgot, how he whilome had sworne,  
> In case he could that monstrous beast destroy,  
> Vnto his Farie Queene backe to returne:  
> The which he shortly did, and *Vna* left to mourne.
>
> Now strike your sailes ye iolly Mariners,  
> For we be come vnto a quiet rode,  
> Where we must land some of our passengers,  
> And light this wearie vessell of her lode.  
> Here she a while may make her safe abode,  
> Till she repaired haue her tackles spent,  
> And wants supplide. And then againe abroad  
> On the long voyage whereto she is bent:  
> Well may she speede and fairely finish her intent.
