*Cant. VII.*

> *Turpine is baffuld, his two knights  
> doe gaine their treasons meed;  
> Fayre Mirabellaes punishment  
> for loues disdaine decreed.*

> L Ike as the gentle hart it selfe bewrayes,  
> In doing gentle deedes with franke delight,  
> Euen so the baser mind it selfe displayes,  
> In cancred malice and reuengefull spright.  
> For to maligne, t'enuie, t'vse shifting slight,  
> Be arguments of a vile donghill mind;  
> Which what it dare not doe by open might,  
> To worke by wicked treason wayes doth find,  
> By such discourteous deeds discouering his base kind.
>
> That well appeares in this discourteous knight,  
> The coward *Turpine*, whereof now I treat;  
> Who notwithstanding that in former fight  
> He of the Prince his life receiued late,  
> Yet in his mind malitious and ingrate  
> He gan deuize, to be aueng'd anew  
> For all that shame, which kindled inward hate.  
> Therefore so soone as he was out of vew,  
> Himselfe in hast he arm'd, and did him fast pursew.
>
> Well did he tract his steps, as he did ryde,  
> Yet would not neare approch in daungers eye,  
> But kept aloofe for dread to be descryde,  
> Vntill fit time and place he mote espy,  
> Where he mote worke him scath and villeny.  
> At last he met two knights to him vnknowne,  
> The which were armed both agreeably,  
> And both combynd, what euer chaunce were blowne,  
> Betwixt them to diuide, and each to make his owne.
>
> To whom false *Turpine* comming courteously,  
> To cloke the mischiefe, which he inly ment,  
> Gan to complaine of great discourtesie,  
> Which a straunge knight, that neare afore him went,  
> Had doen to him, and his deare Ladie shent:  
> Which if they would afford him ayde at need  
> For to auenge, in time conuenient,  
> They should accomplish both a knightly deed,  
> And for their paines obtaine of him a goodly meed.
>
> The knights beleeu'd, that all he sayd, was trew,  
> And being fresh and full of youthly spright,  
> Were glad to heare of that aduenture new,  
> In which they mote make triall of their might,  
> Which neuer yet they had approu'd in fight;  
> And eke desirous of the offred meed,  
> Said then the one of them; Where is that wight,  
> The which hath doen to thee this wrongfull deed,  
> That we may it auenge, and punish him with speed?
>
> He rides (said *Turpine*) there not farre afore,  
> With a wyld man soft footing by his syde,  
> That if ye list to haste a litle more,  
> Ye may him ouertake in timely tyde:  
> Eftsoones they pricked forth with forward pryde,  
> And ere that litle while they ridden had,  
> The gentle Prince not farre away they spyde,  
> Ryding a softly pace with portance sad,  
> Deuizing of his loue more, then of daunger drad.
>
> Then one of them aloud vnto him cryde,  
> Bidding him turne againe, false traytour knight,  
> Foule womanwronger, for he him defyde.  
> With that they both at once with equall spight  
> Did bend their speares, and both with equall might  
> Against him ran; but th'one did misse his marke,  
> And being carried with his force forthright,  
> Glaunst swiftly by; like to that heauenly sparke,  
> Which glyding through the ayre lights all the heauens darke.
>
> But th'other ayming better, did him smite  
> Full in the shield, with so impetuous powre,  
> That all his launce in peeces shiuered quite,  
> And scattered all about, fell on the flowre.  
> But the stout Prince, with much more steddy stowre  
> Full on his beuer did him strike so sore,  
> That the cold steele through piercing, did deuowre  
> His vitall breath, and to the ground him bore,  
> Where still he bathed lay in his owne bloody gore.
>
> As when a cast of Faulcons make their flight  
> At an Herneshaw, that lyes aloft on wing,  
> The whyles they strike at him with heedlesse might,  
> The warie foule his bill doth backward wring;  
> On which the first, whose force her first doth bring,  
> Her selfe quite through the bodie doth engore,  
> And falleth downe to ground like senselesse thing,  
> But th'other not so swift, as she before,  
> Fayles of her souse, and passing by doth hurt no more.
>
> By this the other, which was passed by,  
> Himselfe recouering, was return'd to fight;  
> Where when he saw his fellow lifelesse ly,  
> He much was daunted with so dismall sight;  
> Yet nought abating of his former spight,  
> Let driue at him with so malitious mynd,  
> As if he would haue passed through him quight:  
> But the steele-head no stedfast hold could fynd,  
> But glauncing by, deceiu'd him of that he desynd.
>
> Not so the Prince: for his well learned speare  
> Tooke surer hould, and from his horses backe  
> Aboue a launces length him forth did beare,  
> And gainst the cold hard earth so sore him strake,  
> That all his bones in peeces nigh he brake.  
> Where seeing him so lie, he left his steed,  
> And to him leaping, vengeance thought to take  
> Of him, for all his former follies meed,  
> With flaming sword in hand his terror more to breed.
>
> The fearefull swayne beholding death so nie,  
> Cryde out aloud for mercie him to saue;  
> In lieu whereof he would to him descrie,  
> Great treason to him meant, his life to reaue.  
> The Prince soone hearkned, and his life forgaue.  
> Then thus said he, There is a straunger knight,  
> The which for promise of great meed, vs draue  
> To this attempt, to wreake his hid despight,  
> For that himselfe thereto did want sufficient might.
>
> The Prince much mused at such villenie,  
> And sayd; Now sure ye well haue earn'd your meed,  
> For th'one is dead, and th'other soone shall die,  
> Vnlesse to me thou hether bring with speed  
> The wretch, that hyr'd you to this wicked deed.  
> He glad of life, and willing eke to wreake  
> The guilt on him, which did this mischiefe breed,  
> Swore by his sword, that neither day nor weeke  
> He would surceasse, but him, where so he were, would seeke.
>
> So vp he rose, and forth streight way he went  
> Backe to the place, where *Turpine* late he lore;  
> There he him found in great astonishment,  
> To see him so bedight with bloodie gore,  
> And griesly wounds that him appalled sore.  
> Yet thus at length he said, How now Sir Knight?  
> What meaneth this, which here I see before?  
> How fortuneth this foule vncomely plight,  
> So different from that, which earst ye seem'd in sight?
>
> Perdie (said he) in euill houre it fell,  
> That euer I for meed did vndertake  
> So hard a taske, as life for hyre to sell;  
> The which I earst aduentur'd for your sake.  
> Witnesse the wounds, and this wyde bloudie lake,  
> Which ye may see yet all about me steeme.  
> Therefore now yeeld, as ye did promise make,  
> My due reward, the which right well I deeme  
> I yearned haue, that life so dearely did redeeme.
>
> But where then is (quoth he halfe wrothfully)  
> Where is the bootie, which therefore I bought,  
> That cursed caytiue, my strong enemy,  
> That recreant knight, whose hated life I sought?  
> And where is eke your friend, which halfe it ought?  
> He lyes (said he) vpon the cold bare ground,  
> Slayne of that errant knight, with whom he fought;  
> Whom afterwards my selfe with many a wound  
> Did slay againe, as ye may see there in the stound.
>
> Thereof false *Turpin* was full glad and faine,  
> And needs with him streight to the place would ryde,  
> Where he himselfe might see his foeman slaine;  
> For else his feare could not be satisfyde.  
> So as they rode, he saw the way all dyde  
> With streames of bloud; which tracting by the traile,  
> Ere long they came, whereas in euill tyde  
> That other swayne, like ashes deadly pale,  
> Lay in the lap of death, rewing his wretched bale.
>
> Much did the Crauen seeme to mone his case,  
> That for his sake his deare life had forgone;  
> And him bewayling with affection base,  
> Did counterfeit kind pittie, where was none:  
> For wheres no courage, theres no ruth nor mone.  
> Thence passing forth, not farre away he found,  
> Whereas the Prince himselfe lay all alone,  
> Loosely displayd vpon the grassie ground,  
> Possessed of sweete sleepe, that luld him soft in swound.
>
> Wearie of trauell in his former fight,  
> He there in shade himselfe had layd to rest,  
> Hauing his armes and warlike things vndight,  
> Fearelesse of foes that mote his peace molest;  
> The whyles his saluage page, that wont be prest,  
> Was wandred in the wood another way,  
> To doe some thing, that seemed to him best,  
> The whyles his Lord in siluer slomber lay,  
> Like to the Euening starre adorn'd with deawy ray.
>
> Whom when as *Turpin* saw so loosely layd,  
> He weened well, that he in deed was dead,  
> Like as that other knight to him had sayd:  
> But when he nigh approcht, he mote aread  
> Plaine signes in him of life and liuelihead.  
> Whereat much grieu'd against that straunger knight,  
> That him too light of credence did mislead,  
> He would haue backe retyred from that sight,  
> That was to him on earth the deadliest despight.
>
> But that same knight would not once let him start,  
> But plainely gan to him declare the case  
> Of all his mischiefe, and late lucklesse smart;  
> How both he and his fellow there in place  
> Were vanquished, and put to foule disgrace,  
> And how that he in lieu of life him lent,  
> Had vow'd vnto the victor, him to trace  
> And follow through the world, where so he went,  
> Till that he him deliuered to his punishment.
>
> He therewith much abashed and affrayd,  
> Began to tremble euery limbe and vaine;  
> And softly whispering him, entyrely prayd,  
> T'aduize him better, then by such a traine  
> Him to betray vnto a straunger swaine:  
> Yet rather counseld him contrarywize,  
> Sith he likewise did wrong by him sustaine,  
> To ioyne with him and vengeance to deuize,  
> Whylest time did offer meanes him sleeping to surprize.
>
> Nathelesse for all his speach, the gentle knight  
> Would not be tempted to such villenie,  
> Regarding more his faith, which he did plight,  
> All were it to his mortall enemie,  
> Then to entrap him by false treacherie:  
> Great shame in lieges blood to be embrew'd.  
> Thus whylest they were debating diuerslie,  
> The Saluage forth out of the wood issew'd  
> Backe to the place, whereas his Lord he sleeping vew'd.
>
> There when he saw those two so neare him stand,  
> He doubted much what mote their meaning bee,  
> And throwing downe his load out of his hand,  
> To weet great store of forrest frute, which hee  
> Had for his food late gathered from the tree,  
> Himselfe vnto his weapon he betooke,  
> That was an oaken plant, which lately hee  
> Rent by the root; which he so sternely shooke,  
> That like an hazell wand, it quiuered and quooke.
>
> Whereat the Prince awaking, when he spyde  
> The traytour *Turpin* with that other knight,  
> He started vp, and snatching neare his syde  
> His trustie sword, the seruant of his might,  
> Like a fell Lyon leaped to him light,  
> And his left hand vpon his collar layd.  
> Therewith the cowheard deaded with affright,  
> Fell flat to ground, ne word vnto him sayd,  
> But holding vp his hands, with silence mercie prayd.
>
> But he so full of indignation was,  
> That to his prayer nought he would incline,  
> But as he lay vpon the humbled gras,  
> His foot he set on his vile necke, in signe  
> Of seruile yoke, that nobler harts repine.  
> Then letting him arise like abiect thrall,  
> He gan to him obiect his haynous crime,  
> And to reuile, and rate, and recreant call,  
> And lastly to despoyle of knightly bannerall.
>
> And after all, for greater infamie,  
> He by the heeles him hung vpon a tree,  
> And baffuld so, that all which passed by,  
> The picture of his punishment might see,  
> And by the like ensample warned bee,  
> How euer they through treason doe trespasse.  
> But turne we now backe to that Ladie free,  
> 1 Whom late we left ryding vpon an Asse,  
> Led by a Carle and foole, which by her side did passe.
>
> She was a Ladie of great dignitie,  
> And lifted vp to honorable place,  
> Famous through all the land of Faerie,  
> Though of meane parentage and kindred base,  
> Yet deckt with wondrous giftes of natures grace,  
> That all men did her person much admire,  
> And praise the feature of her goodly face,  
> The beames whereof did kindle louely fire  
> In th'harts of many a knight, and many a gentle squire.
>
> But she thereof grew proud and insolent,  
> That none she worthie thought to be her fere,  
> But scornd them all, that loue vnto her ment:  
> Yet was she lou'd of many a worthy pere;  
> Vnworthy she to be belou'd so dere,  
> That could not weigh of worthinesse aright.  
> For beautie is more glorious bright and clere,  
> The more it is admir'd of many a wight,  
> And noblest she, that serued is of noblest knight.
>
> But this coy Damzell thought contrariwize,  
> That such proud looks would make her praysed more;  
> And that the more she did all loue despize,  
> The more would wretched louers her adore.  
> What cared she, who sighed for her sore,  
> Or who did wayle or watch the wearie night?  
> Let them that list, their lucklesse lot deplore;  
> She was borne free, not bound to any wight,  
> And so would euer liue, and loue her owne delight.
>
> Through such her stubborne stifnesse, and hard hart,  
> Many a wretch, for want of remedie,  
> Did languish long in lifeconsuming smart,  
> And at the last through dreary dolour die:  
> Whylest she, the Ladie of her libertie,  
> Did boast her beautie had such soueraine might,  
> That with the onely twinckle of her eye,  
> She could or saue, or spill, whom she would hight.  
> What could the Gods doe more, but doe it more aright?
>
> But loe the Gods, that mortall follies vew,  
> Did worthily reuenge this maydens pride;  
> And nought regarding her so goodly hew,  
> Did laugh at her, that many did deride,  
> Whilest she did weepe, of no man mercifide.  
> For on a day, when *Cupid* kept his court,  
> As he is wont at each Saint Valentide,  
> Vnto the which all louers doe resort,  
> That of their loues successe they there may make report.
>
> It fortun'd then, that when the roules were red,  
> In wich the names of all loues folke were fyled,  
> That many there were missing, which were ded,  
> Or kept in bands, or from their loues exyled,  
> Or by some other violence despoyled.  
> Which when as *Cupid* heard, he wexed wroth,  
> And doubting to be wronged, or beguyled,  
> He bad his eyes to be vnblindfold both,  
> That he might see his men, and muster them by oth.
>
> Then found he many missing of his crew,  
> Which wont doe suit and seruice to his might;  
> Of whom what was becomen, no man knew.  
> Therefore a Iurie was impaneld streight,  
> T'enquire of them, whether by force, or sleight,  
> Or their owne guilt, they were away conuayd.  
> To whom foule *Infamie*, and fell *Despight*  
> Gaue euidence, that they were all betrayd,  
> And murdred cruelly by a rebellious Mayd.
>
> Fayre *Mirabella* was her name, whereby  
> Of all those crymes she there indited was:  
> All which when *Cupid* heard, he by and by  
> In great displeasure, wild a *Capias*  
> Should issue forth, t'attach that scornefull lasse.  
> The warrant straight was made, and therewithall  
> A Baylieffe errant forth in post did passe,  
> Whom they by name there *Portamore* did call;  
> He which doth summon louers to Loues iudgement hall.
>
> The damzell was attacht, and shortly brought  
> Vnto the barre, whereas she was arrayned:  
> But she thereto nould plead, nor answere ought  
> Euen for stubborne pride, which her restrayned.  
> So iudgement past, as is by law ordayned  
> In cases like, which when at last she saw,  
> Her stubborne hart, which loue before disdayned,  
> Gan stoupe, and falling downe with humble awe,  
> Cryde mercie, to abate the extremitie of law.
>
> The sonne of *Venus* who is myld by kynd,  
> But where he is prouokt with peeuishnesse,  
> Vnto her prayers piteously enclynd,  
> And did the rigour of his doome represse;  
> Yet not so freely, but that nathelesse  
> He vnto her a penance did impose:  
> Which was, that through this worlds wyde wildernes  
> She wander should in companie of those,  
> Till she had sau'd so many loues, as she did lose.
>
> So now she had bene wandring two whole yeares  
> Throughout the world, in this vncomely case,  
> Wasting her goodly hew in heauie teares,  
> And her good dayes in dolorous disgrace:  
> Yet had she not in all these two yeares space,  
> Saued but two, yet in two yeares before,  
> Through her dispiteous pride, whilest loue lackt place,  
> She had destroyed two and twenty more.  
> Aie me, how could her loue make half amends therefore.
>
> And now she was vppon the weary way,  
> When as the gentle Squire, with faire *Serene*,  
> Met her in such misseeming foule array;  
> The whiles that mighty man did her demeane  
> With all the euill termes and cruell meane,  
> That he could make; And eeke that angry foole  
> Which follow'd her, with cursed hands vncleane  
> Whipping her horse, did with his smarting toole  
> Oft whip her dainty selfe, and much augment her doole.
>
> Ne ought it mote auaile her to entreat  
> The one or th'other, better her to vse:  
> For both so wilfull were and obstinate,  
> That all her piteous plaint they did refuse,  
> And rather did the more her beate and bruse.  
> But most the former villaine, which did lead  
> Her tyreling iade, was bent her to abuse;  
> Who though she were with wearinesse nigh dead,  
> Yet would not let her lite, nor rest a little stead.
>
> For he was sterne, and terrible by nature,  
> And eeke of person huge and hideous,  
> Exceeding much the measure of mans stature,  
> And rather like a Gyant monstruous.  
> For sooth he was descended of the hous  
> Of those old Gyants, which did warres darraine  
> Against the heauen in order battailous,  
> And sib to great *Orgolio*, which was slaine  
> By *Arthure*, when as *Vnas* Knight he did maintaine.
>
> His lookes were dreadfull, and his fiery eies  
> Like two great Beacons, glared bright and wyde,  
> Glauncing askew, as if his enemies  
> He scorned in his ouerweening pryde;  
> And stalking stately like a Crane, did stryde  
> At euery step vppon the tiptoes hie,  
> And all the way he went, on euery syde  
> He gaz'd about, and stared horriblie,  
> As if he with his lookes would all men terrifie.
>
> He wore no armour, ne for none did care,  
> As no whit dreading any liuing wight;  
> But in a Iacket quilted richly rare,  
> Vpon checklaton he was straungely dight,  
> And on his head a roll of linnen plight,  
> Like to the Mores of Malaber he wore;  
> With which his locks, as blacke as pitchy night,  
> Were bound about, and voyded from before,  
> And in his hand a mighty yron club he bore.
>
> This was *Disdaine*, who led that Ladies horse  
> Through thick and thin, through mountains & through plains,  
> Compelling her, wher she would not, by force,  
> Haling her palfrey by the hempen raines.  
> But that same foole, which most increast her paines,  
> Was *Scorne*, who hauing in his hand a whip,  
> Her therewith yirks, and still when she complaines,  
> The more he laughes, and does her closely quip,  
> To see her sore lament, and bite her tender lip.
>
> Whose cruell handling when that Squire beheld,  
> And saw those villaines her so vildely vse,  
> His gentle heart with indignation sweld,  
> And could no lenger beare so great abuse,  
> As such a Lady so to beate and bruse;  
> But to him stepping, such a stroke him lent,  
> That forst him th'halter from his hand to loose,  
> And maugre all his might, backe to relent:  
> Else had he surely there bene slaine, or fowlyshent.
>
> The villaine, wroth for greeting him so sore,  
> Gathered him selfe together soone againe,  
> And with his yron batton, which he bore,  
> Let driue at him so dreadfully amaine,  
> That for his safety he did him constraine  
> To giue him ground, and shift to euery side,  
> Rather then once his burden to sustaine:  
> For bootelesse thing him seemed, to abide  
> So mighty blowes, or proue the puissaunce of his pride.
>
> Like as a Mastiffe hauing at a bay  
> A saluage Bull, whose cruell hornes doe threat  
> Desperate daunger, if he them assay,  
> Traceth his ground, and round about doth beat,  
> To spy where he may some aduauntage get;  
> The whiles the beast doth rage and loudly rore,  
> So did the Squire, the whiles the Carle did fret,  
> And fume in his disdainefull mynd the more,  
> And oftentimes by Turmagant and Mahound swore.
>
> Nathelesse so sharpely still he him pursewd,  
> That at aduantage him at last he tooke,  
> When his foote slipt (that slip he dearely rewd,)  
> And with his yron club to ground him strooke;  
> Where still he lay, ne out of swoune awooke,  
> Till heauy hand the Carle vpon him layd,  
> And bound him fast: Tho when he vp did looke,  
> And saw him selfe captiu'd, he was dismayd,  
> Ne powre had to withstand, ne hope of any ayd.
>
> Then vp he made him rise, and forward fare,  
> Led in a rope, which both his hands did bynd;  
> Ne ought that foole for pitty did him spare,  
> But with his whip him following behynd,  
> Him often scourg'd, and forst his feete to fynd:  
> And other whiles with bitter mockes and mowes  
> He would him scorne, that to his gentle mynd  
> Was much more grieuous, then the others blowes:  
> Words sharpely wound, but greatest griefe of scorning growes.
>
> The faire *Serena*, when she saw him fall  
> Vnder that villaines club, then surely thought  
> That slaine he was, or made a wretched thrall,  
> And fled away with all the speede she mought,  
> To seeke for safety, which long time she sought:  
> And past through many perils by the way,  
> Ere she againe to *Calepine* was brought;  
> The which discourse as now I must delay,  
> Till *Mirabellaes* fortunes I doe further say.
