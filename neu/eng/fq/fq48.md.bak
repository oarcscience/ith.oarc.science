*Cant. IX.*

> *The Squire of low degree releast  
> Poeana takes to wife:  
> Britomart fightes with many Knights,  
> Prince Arthur stints their strife.*

> H Ard is the doubt, and difficult to deeme,  
> When all three kinds of loue together meet,  
> And doe dispart the hart with powre extreme,  
> Whether shall weigh the balance downe; to weet  
> The deare affection vnto kindred sweet,  
> Or raging fire of loue to woman kind,  
> Or zeale of friends combynd with vertues meet.  
> But of them all the band of vertuous mind  
> Me seemes the gentle hart should most assured bind.
>
> For naturall affection soone doth cesse,  
> And quenched is with *Cupids* greater flame:  
> But faithfull friendship doth them both suppresse,  
> And them with maystring discipline doth tame,  
> Through thoughts aspyring to eternall fame.  
> For as the soule doth rule the earthly masse,  
> And all the seruice of the bodie frame,  
> So loue of soule doth loue of bodie passe,  
> No lesse then perfect gold surmounts the meanest brasse.
>
> All which who list by tryall to assay,  
> Shall in this storie find approued plaine;  
> In which these Squires true friendship more did sway,  
> Then either care of parents could refraine,  
> Or loue of fairest Ladie could constraine.  
> For though *Poeana* were as faire as morne,  
> Yet did this trustie Squire with proud disdaine  
> For his friends sake her offred fauours scorne,  
> And she her selfe her syre, of whom she was yborne.
>
> Now after that Prince *Arthur* graunted had,  
> To yeeld strong succour to that gentle swayne,  
> Who now long time had lyen in prison sad,  
> He gan aduise how best he mote darrayne  
> That enterprize, for greatest glories gayne.  
> That headlesse tyrants tronke he reard from ground,  
> And hauing ympt the head to it agayne,  
> Vpon his vsuall beast it firmely bound,  
> And made it so to ride, as it aliue was found.
>
> Then did he take that chaced Squire, and layd  
> Before the ryder, as he captiue were,  
> And made his Dwarfe, though with vnwilling ayd,  
> To guide the beast, that did his maister beare,  
> Till to his castle they approched neare.  
> Whom when the watch, that kept continuall ward  
> Saw comming home; all voide of doubtfull feare,  
> He running downe, the gate to him vnbard;  
> Whom straight the Prince ensuing, in together far'd.
>
> There he did find in her delitious boure  
> The faire *Poeana* playing on a Rote,  
> Complayning of her cruell Paramoure,  
> And singing all her sorrow to the note,  
> As she had learned readily by rote.  
> That with the sweetnesse of her rare delight,  
> The Prince halfe rapt, began on her to dote:  
> Till better him bethinking of the right,  
> He her vnwares attacht, and captiue held by might.
>
> Whence being forth produc'd, when she perceiued  
> Her owne deare sire, she cald to him for aide.  
> But when of him no aunswere she receiued,  
> But saw him sencelesse by the Squire vpstaide,  
> She weened well, that then she was betraide:  
> Then gan she loudly cry, and weepe, and waile,  
> And that same Squire of treason to vpbraide.  
> But all in vaine, her plaints might not preuaile,  
> Ne none there was to reskue her, ne none to baile.
>
> Then tooke he that same Dwarfe, and him compeld  
> To open vnto him the prison dore,  
> And forth to bring those thrals, which there he held.  
> Thence forth were brought to him aboue a score  
> Of Knights and Squires to him vnknowne afore:  
> All which he did from bitter bondage free,  
> And vnto former liberty restore.  
> Amongst the rest, that Squire of low degree  
> Came forth full weake and wan, not like him selfe to bee.
>
> Whom soone as faire *AEmylia* beheld,  
> And *Placidas*, they both vnto him ran,  
> And him embracing fast betwixt them held,  
> Striuing to comfort him all that they can,  
> And kissing oft his visage pale and wan.  
> That faire *Poeana* them beholding both,  
> Gan both enuy, and bitterly to ban;  
> Through iealous passion weeping inly wroth,  
> To see the sight perforce, that both her eyes were loth.
>
> But when a while they had together beene,  
> And diuersly conferred of their case,  
> She, though full oft she both of them had seene  
> A sunder, yet not euer in one place,  
> Began to doubt, when she them saw embrace,  
> Which was the captiue Squire she lou'd so deare,  
> Deceiued through great likenesse of their face.  
> For they so like in person did appeare,  
> That she vneath discerned, whether whether weare.
>
> And eke the Prince, when as he them auized,  
> Their like resemblaunce much admired there,  
> And mazd how nature had so well disguized  
> Her worke, and counterfet her selfe so nere,  
> As if that by one patterne seene somewhere,  
> She had them made a paragone to be,  
> Or whether it through skill, or errour were.  
> Thus gazing long, at them much wondred he,  
> So did the other knights and Squires, which him did see.
>
> Then gan they ransacke that same Castle strong,  
> In which he found great store of hoorded threasure,  
> The which that tyrant gathered had by wrong  
> And tortious powre, without respect or measure.  
> Vpon all which the Briton Prince made seasure,  
> And afterwards continu'd there a while,  
> To rest him selfe, and solace in soft pleasure  
> Those weaker Ladies after weary toile;  
> To whom he did diuide part of his purchast spoile.
>
> And for more ioy, that captiue Lady faire  
> The faire *Poeana* he enlarged free;  
> And by the rest did set in sumptuous chaire,  
> To feast and frollicke; nathemore would she  
> Shew gladsome countenaunce nor pleasaunt glee:  
> But grieued was for losse both of her sire,  
> And eke of Lordship, with both land and fee:  
> But most she touched was with griefe entire,  
> For losse of her new loue, the hope of her desire.
>
> But her the Prince through his well wonted grace,  
> To better termes of myldnesse did entreat,  
> From that fowle rudenesse, which did her deface;  
> And that same bitter corsiue, which did eat  
> Her tender heart, and made refraine from meat,  
> He with good thewes and speaches well applyde,  
> Did mollifie, and calme her raging heat.  
> For though she were most faire, and goodly dyde,  
> Yet she it all did mar with cruelty and pride.
>
> And for to shut vp all in friendly loue,  
> Sith loue was first the ground of all her griefe,  
> That trusty Squire he wisely well did moue  
> Not to despise that dame, which lou'd him liefe,  
> Till he had made of her some better priefe,  
> But to accept her to his wedded wife.  
> Thereto he offred for to make him chiefe  
> Of all her land and lordship during life:  
> He yeelded, and her tooke; so stinted all their strife.
>
> From that day forth in peace and ioyous blis,  
> They liu'd together long without debate:  
> Ne priuate iarre, ne spite of enemis  
> Could shake the safe assuraunce of their state.  
> And she whom Nature did so faire create,  
> That she mote match the fairest of her daies,  
> Yet with lewd loues and lust intemperate  
> Had it defaste; thenceforth reformd her waies,  
> That all men much admyrde her change, and spake her praise.
>
> Thus when the Prince had perfectly compylde  
> These paires of friends in peace and setled rest,  
> Him selfe, whose minde did trauell as with chylde,  
> Of his old loue, conceau'd in secret brest,  
> Resolued to pursue his former quest;  
> And taking leaue of all, with him did beare  
> Faire *Amoret*, whom Fortune by bequest  
> Had left in his protection whileare,  
> Exchanged out of one into an other feare.
>
> Feare of her safety did her not constraine,  
> For well she wist now in a mighty hond,  
> Her person late in perill, did remaine,  
> Who able was all daungers to withstond.  
> But now in feare of shame she more did stond,  
> Seeing her selfe all soly succourlesse,  
> Left in the victors powre, like vassall bond;  
> Whose will her weakenesse could no way represse,  
> In case his burning lust should breake into excesse.
>
> But cause of feare sure had she none at all  
> Of him, who goodly learned had of yore  
> The course of loose affection to forstall,  
> And lawlesse lust to rule with reasons lore;  
> That all the while he by his side her bore,  
> She was as safe as in a Sanctuary;  
> Thus many miles they two together wore,  
> To seeke their loues dispersed diuersly,  
> Yet neither shewed to other their hearts priuity.
>
> At length they came, whereas a troupe of Knights  
> They saw together skirmishing, as seemed:  
> Sixe they were all, all full of fell despight,  
> But foure of them the battell best beseemed,  
> That which of them was best, mote not be deemed.  
> Those foure were they, from whom false *Florimell*  
> By *Braggadochio* lately was redeemed.  
> To weet, sterne *Druon*, and lewd *Claribell*,  
> Loue-lauish *Blandamour*, and lustfull *Paridell*.
>
> *Druons* delight was all in single life,  
> And vnto Ladies loue would lend no leasure:  
> The more was *Claribell* enraged rife  
> With feruent flames, and loued out of measure:  
> So eke lou'd *Blandamour*, but yet at pleasure  
> Would change his liking, and new Lemans proue:  
> But *Paridell* of loue did make no threasure,  
> But lusted after all, that him did moue.  
> So diuersly these foure disposed were to loue.
>
> But those two other which beside them stoode,  
> Were *Britomart*, and gentle *Scudamour*,  
> Who all the while beheld their wrathfull moode,  
> And wondred at their impacable stoure,  
> Whose like they neuer saw till that same houre:  
> So dreadfull strokes each did at other driue,  
> And laid on load with all their might and powre,  
> As if that euery dint the ghost would riue  
> Out of their wretched corses, and their liues depriue.
>
> As when *Dan AEolus* in great displeasure,  
> For losse of his deare loue by *Neptune* hent,  
> Sends forth the winds out of his hidden threasure,  
> Vpon the sea to wreake his fell intent;  
> They breaking forth with rude vnruliment,  
> From all foure parts of heauen doe rage full sore,  
> And tosse the deepes, and teare the firmament,  
> And all the world confound with wide vprore,  
> As if in stead thereof they *Chaos* would restore.
>
> Cause of their discord, and so fell debate,  
> Was for the loue of that same snowy maid,  
> Whome they had lost in Turneyment of late,  
> And seeking long, to weet which way she straid  
> Met here together; where through lewd vpbraide  
> Of *Ate* and *Duessa* they fell out,  
> And each one taking part in others aide,  
> This cruell conflict raised thereabout,  
> Whose dangerous successe depended yet in dout.
>
> For sometimes *Paridell* and *Blandamour*  
> The better had, and bet the others backe,  
> Eftsoones the others did the field recoure,  
> And on their foes did worke full cruell wracke:  
> Yet neither would their fiendlike fury slacke,  
> But euermore their malice did augment;  
> Till that vneath they forced were for lacke  
> Of breath, their raging rigour to relent,  
> And rest themselues for to recouer spirits spent.
>
> There gan they change their sides, and new parts take;  
> For *Paridell* did take to *Druons* side,  
> For old despight, which now forth newly brake  
> Gainst *Blandamour*, whom alwaies he enuide:  
> And *Blandamour* to *Claribell* relide.  
> So all afresh gan former fight renew.  
> As when two Barkes, this caried with the tide,  
> That with the wind, contrary courses sew,  
> If wind and tide doe change, their courses change anew.
>
> Thenceforth they much more furiously gan fare,  
> As if but then the battell had begonne,  
> Ne helmets bright, ne hawberks strong did spare,  
> That through the clifts the vermeil bloud out sponne,  
> And all adowne their riuen sides did ronne.  
> Such mortall malice, wonder was to see  
> In friends profest, and so great outrage donne:  
> But sooth is said, and tride in each degree,  
> Faint friends when they fall out, most cruell fomen bee.
>
> Thus they long while continued in fight,  
> Till *Scudamour*, and that same Briton maide,  
> By fortune in that place did chance to light:  
> Whom soone as they with wrathfull eie bewraide,  
> They gan remember of the fowle vpbraide,  
> The which that Britonesse had to them donne,  
> In that late Turney for the snowy maide;  
> Where she had them both shamefully fordonne,  
> And eke the famous prize of beauty from them wonne.
>
> Eftsoones all burning with a fresh desire,  
> Of fell reuenge, in their malicious mood  
> They from them selues gan turne their furious ire,  
> And cruell blades yet steeming with whot bloud,  
> Against those two let driue, as they were wood:  
> Who wondring much at that so sodaine fit,  
> Yet nought dismayd, them stoutly well withstood;  
> Ne yeelded foote, ne once abacke did flit,  
> But being doubly smitten likewise doubly smit.
>
> The warlike Dame was on her part assaid,  
> Of *Claribell* and *Blandamour* attone;  
> And *Paridell* and *Druon* fiercely laid  
> At *Scudamour*, both his professed fone.  
> Foure charged two, and two surcharged one;  
> Yet did those two them selues so brauely beare,  
> That the other litle gained by the lone,  
> But with their owne repayed duely weare,  
> And vsury withall: such gaine was gotten deare.
>
> Full oftentimes did *Britomart* assay  
> To speake to them, and some emparlance moue;  
> But they for nought their cruell hands would stay,  
> Ne lend an eare to ought, that might behoue,  
> As when an eager mastiffe once doth proue  
> The tast of bloud of some engored beast,  
> No words may rate, nor rigour him remoue  
> From greedy hold of that his blouddy feast:  
> So litle did they hearken to her sweet beheast.
>
> Whom when the Briton Prince a farre beheld  
> With ods of so vnequall match opprest,  
> His mighty heart with indignation sweld,  
> And inward grudge fild his heroicke brest:  
> Eftsoones him selfe he to their aide addrest,  
> And thrusting fierce into the thickest preace,  
> Diuided them, how euer loth to rest,  
> And would them faine from battell to surceasse,  
> With gentle words perswading them to friendly peace.
>
> But they so farre from peace or patience were,  
> That all at once at him gan fiercely flie,  
> And lay on load, as they him downe would beare;  
> Like to a storme, which houers vnder skie  
> Long here and there, and round about doth stie,  
> At length breakes downe in raine, and haile, and sleet,  
> First from one coast, till nought thereof be drie;  
> And then another, till that likewise fleet;  
> And so from side to side till all the world it weet.
>
> But now their forces greatly were decayd,  
> The Prince yet being fresh vntoucht afore;  
> Who them with speaches milde gan first disswade  
> From such foule outrage, and them long forbore:  
> Till seeing them through suffrance hartned more,  
> Him selfe he bent their furies to abate,  
> And layd at them so sharpely and so sore,  
> That shortly them compelled to retrate,  
> And being brought in daunger, to relent too late.
>
> But now his courage being throughly fired,  
> He ment to make them know their follies prise,  
> Had not those two him instantly desired  
> T'asswage his wrath, and pardon their mesprise.  
> At whose request he gan him selfe aduise  
> To stay his hand, and of a truce to treat  
> In milder tearmes, as list them to deuise:  
> Mongst which the cause of their so cruell heat  
> He did them aske, who all that passed gan repeat.
>
> And told at large how that same errant Knight,  
> To weet faire *Britomart*, them late had foyled  
> In open turney, and by wrongfull fight  
> Both of their publicke praise had them despoyled,  
> And also of their priuate loues beguyled;  
> Of two full hard to read the harder theft.  
> But she that wrongfull challenge soone assoyled,  
> And shew'd that she had not that Lady reft,  
> (As they supposd) but her had to her liking left.
>
> To whom the Prince thus goodly well replied;  
> Certes sir Knight\[s\], ye seemen much to blame,  
> To rip vp wrong, that battell once hath tried;  
> Wherein the honor both of Armes ye shame,  
> And eke the loue of Ladies foule defame;  
> To whom the world this franchise euer yeelded,  
> That of their loues choise they might freedom clame,  
> And in that right should by all knights be shielded:  
> Gainst which me seemes this war ye wrongfully haue wielded.
>
> And yet (quoth she) a greater wrong remaines:  
> For I thereby my former loue haue lost,  
> Whom seeking euer since with endlesse paines,  
> Hath me much sorrow and much trauell cost;  
> Aye me to see that gentle maide so tost.  
> But *Scudamour* then sighing deepe, thus saide,  
> Certes her losse ought me to sorrow most,  
> Whose right she is, where euer she be straide,  
> Through many perils wonne, and many fortunes waide.
>
> For from the first that I her loue profest,  
> Vnto this houre, this present lucklesse howre,  
> I neuer ioyed happinesse nor rest,  
> But thus turmoild from one to other stowre,  
> I wast my life, and doe my daies deuowre  
> In wretched anguishe and incessant woe,  
> Passing the measure of my feeble powre,  
> That liuing thus, a wretch and louing so,  
> I neither can my loue, ne yet my life forgo.
>
> Then good sir *Claribell* him thus bespake,  
> Now were it not sir *Scudamour* to you,  
> Dislikefull paine, so sad a taske to take,  
> Mote we entreat you, sith this gentle crew  
> Is now so well accorded all anew;  
> That as we ride together on our way,  
> Ye will recount to vs in order dew  
> All that aduenture, which ye did assay  
> For that faire Ladies loue: past perils well apay.
>
> So gan the rest him likewise to require,  
> But *Britomart* did him importune hard,  
> To take on him that paine: whose great desire  
> He glad to satisfie, him selfe prepar'd  
> To tell through what misfortune he had far'd,  
> In that atchieuement, as to him befell.  
> And all those daungers vnto them declar'd,  
> Which sith they cannot in this Canto well  
> Comprised be, I will them in another tell.
