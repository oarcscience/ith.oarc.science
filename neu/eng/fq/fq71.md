*Cant. VI.*

> *The Hermite heales both Squire and dame  
> Of their sore maladies:  
> He Turpine doth defeate, and shame  
> For his late villanies.*

> N O wound, which warlike hand of enemy  
> Inflicts with dint of sword, so sore doth light,  
> As doth the poysnous sting, which Infamy  
> Infixeth in the name of noble wight:  
> For by no art, nor any leaches might  
> It euer can recured be againe;  
> Ne all the skill, which that immortall spright  
> Of *Podalyrius* did in it retaine,  
> Can remedy such hurts; such hurts are hellish paine.
>
> Such were the wounds, the which that *Blatant Beast*  
> Made in the bodies of that Squire and Dame;  
> And being such, were now much more increast,  
> For want of taking heede vnto the same,  
> That now corrupt and curelesse they became.  
> Howbe that carefull Hermite did his best,  
> With many kindes of medicines meete, to tame  
> The poysnous humour, which did most infest  
> Their ranckling wounds, & euery day them duely drest.
>
> For he right well in Leaches craft was seene,  
> And through the long experience of his dayes,  
> Which had in many fortunes tossed beene,  
> And past through many perillous assayes,  
> He knew the diuerse went of mortall wayes,  
> And in the mindes of men had great insight;  
> Which with sage counsell, when they went astray,  
> He could enforme, and them reduce aright,  
> And al the passiõs heale, which woũd the weaker spright.
>
> For whylome he had bene a doughty Knight,  
> As any one, that liued in his daies,  
> And proued oft in many perillous fight,  
> Of which he grace and glory wonne alwaies,  
> And in all battels bore away the baies.  
> But being now attacht with timely age,  
> And weary of this worlds vnquiet waies,  
> He tooke him selfe vnto this Hermitage,  
> In which he liu'd alone, like carelesse bird in cage.
>
> One day, as he was searching of their wounds,  
> He found that they had festred priuily,  
> And ranckling inward with vnruly stounds,  
> The inner parts now gan to putrify,  
> That quite they seem'd past helpe of surgery,  
> And rather needed to be disciplinde  
> With holesome reede of sad sobriety,  
> To rule the stubborne rage of passion blinde:  
> Giue salues to euery sore, but counsell to the minde.
>
> So taking them apart into his cell,  
> He to that point fit speaches gan to frame,  
> As he the art of words knew wondrous well,  
> And eke could doe, as well as say the same,  
> And thus he to them sayd; Faire daughter Dame,  
> And you faire sonne, which here thus long now lie  
> In piteous languor, since ye hither came,  
> In vaine of me ye hope for remedie,  
> And I likewise in vaine doe salues to you applie.
>
> For in your selfe your onely helpe doth lie,  
> To heale your selues, and must proceed alone  
> From your owne will, to cure your maladie.  
> Who can him cure, that will be cur'd of none?  
> If therefore health ye seeke, obserue this one.  
> First learne your outward sences to refraine  
> From things, that stirre vp fraile affection;  
> Your eies, your eares, your tongue, your talk restraine  
> From that they most affect, and in due termes containe.
>
> For from those outward sences ill affected,  
> The seede of all this euill first doth spring,  
> Which at the first before it had infected,  
> Mote easie be supprest with little thing:  
> But being growen strong, it forth doth bring  
> Sorrow, and anguish, and impatient paine  
> In th'inner parts, and lastly scattering  
> Contagious poyson close through euery vaine,  
> It neuer rests, till it haue wrought his finall bane.
>
> For that beastes teeth, which wounded you tofore,  
> Are so exceeding venemous and keene,  
> Made all of rusty yron, ranckling sore,  
> That where they bite, it booteth not to weene  
> With salue, or antidote, or other mene  
> It euer to amend: ne maruaile ought;  
> For that same beast was bred of hellish strene,  
> And long in darksome *Stygian* den vpbrought,  
> Begot of foule *Echidna*, as in bookes is taught.
>
> *Echidna* is a Monster direfull dred,  
> Whom Gods doe hate, and heauens abhor to see;  
> So hideous is her shape, so huge her hed,  
> That euen the hellish fiends affrighted bee  
> At sight thereof, and from her presence flee:  
> Yet did her face and former parts professe  
> A faire young Mayden, full of comely glee;  
> But all her hinder parts did plaine expresse  
> A monstrous Dragon, full of fearefull vglinesse.
>
> To her the Gods, for her so dreadfull face,  
> In fearefull darkenesse, furthest from the skie,  
> And from the earth, appointed haue her place,  
> Mongst rocks and caues, where she enrold doth lie  
> In hideous horrour and obscurity,  
> Wasting the strength of her immortall age.  
> There did *Typhaon* with her company;  
> Cruell *Typhaon*, whose tempestuous rage  
> Make th'heauens tremble oft, & him with vowes asswage.
>
> Of that commixtion they did then beget  
> This hellish Dog, that hight the *Blatant Beast*;  
> A wicked Monster, that his tongue doth whet  
> Gainst all, both good and bad, both most and least,  
> And poures his poysnous gall forth to infest  
> The noblest wights with notable defame:  
> Ne euer Knight, that bore so lofty creast,  
> Ne euer Lady of so honest name,  
> But he them spotted with reproch, or secrete shame.
>
> In vaine therefore it were, with medicine  
> To goe about to salue such kynd of sore,  
> That rather needes wise read and discipline,  
> Then outward salues, that may augment it more.  
> Aye me (sayd then *Serena* sighing sore)  
> What hope of helpe doth then for vs remaine,  
> If that no salues may vs to health restore?  
> But sith we need good counsell (sayd the swaine)  
> Aread good sire, some counsell, that may vs sustaine.
>
> The best (sayd he) that I can you aduize,  
> Is to auoide the occasion of the ill:  
> For when the cause, whence euill doth arize,  
> Remoued is, th'effect surceaseth still.  
> Abstaine from pleasure, and restraine your will,  
> Subdue desire, and bridle loose delight,  
> Vse scanted diet, and forbeare your fill,  
> Shun secresie, and talke in open sight:  
> So shall you soone repaire your present euill plight.
>
> Thus hauing sayd, his sickely patients  
> Did gladly hearken to his graue beheast,  
> And kept so well his wise commaundements,  
> That in short space their malady was ceast,  
> And eke the biting of that harmefull Beast  
> Was throughly heal'd. Tho when they did perceaue  
> Their wounds recur'd, and forces reincreast,  
> Of that good Hermite both they tooke their leaue,  
> And went both on their way, ne ech would other leaue.
>
> But each the other vow'd t'accompany,  
> The Lady, for that she was much in dred,  
> Now left alone in great extremity,  
> The Squire, for that he courteous was indeed,  
> Would not her leaue alone in her great need.  
> So both together traueld, till they met  
> With a faire Mayden clad in mourning weed,  
> Vpon a mangy iade vnmeetely set,  
> And a lewd foole her leading thorough dry and wet.
>
> But by what meanes that shame to her befell,  
> And how thereof her selfe she did acquite,  
> I must a while forbeare to you to tell;  
> Till that, as comes by course, I doe recite,  
> What fortune to the Briton Prince did lite,  
> Pursuing that proud Knight, the which whileare  
> Wrought to Sir *Calidore* so foule despight;  
> And eke his Lady, though she sickely were,  
> So lewdly had abusde, as ye did lately heare.
>
> The Prince according to the former token,  
> Which faire *Serene* to him deliuered had,  
> Pursu'd him streight, in mynd to bene ywroken  
> Of all the vile demeane, and vsage bad,  
> With which he had those two so ill bestad:  
> Ne wight with him on that aduenture went,  
> But that wylde man, whom though he oft forbad,  
> Yet for no bidding, nor for being shent,  
> Would he restrayned be from his attendement.
>
> Arriuing there, as did by chaunce befall,  
> He found the gate wyde ope, and in he rode,  
> Ne stayd, till that he came into the hall:  
> Where soft dismounting like a weary lode,  
> Vpon the ground with feeble feete he trode,  
> As he vnable were for very neede  
> To moue one foote, but there must make abode;  
> The whiles the saluage man did take his steede,  
> And in some stable neare did set him vp to feede.
>
> Ere long to him a homely groome there came,  
> That in rude wise him asked, what he was,  
> That durst so boldly, without let or shame,  
> Into his Lords forbidden hall to passe.  
> To whom the Prince, him fayning to embase,  
> Mylde answer made; he was an errant Knight,  
> The which was fall'n into this feeble case,  
> Through many wounds, which lately he in fight  
> Receiued had, and prayd to pitty his ill plight.
>
> But he, the more outrageous and bold,  
> Sternely did bid him quickely thence auaunt,  
> Or deare aby, for why his Lord of old  
> Did hate all errant Knights, which there did haunt,  
> Ne lodging would to any of them graunt:  
> And therefore lightly bad him packe away,  
> Not sparing him with bitter words to taunt;  
> And therewithall rude hand on him did lay.  
> To thrust him out of dore, doing his worst assay.
>
> Which when the Saluage comming now in place,  
> Beheld, eftsoones he all enraged grew,  
> And running streight vpon that villaine base,  
> Like a fell Lion at him fiercely flew,  
> And with his teeth and nailes, in present vew,  
> Him rudely rent, and all to peeces tore:  
> So miserably him all helpelesse slew,  
> That with the noise, whilest he did loudly rore,  
> The people of the house rose forth in great vprore.
>
> Who when on ground they saw their fellow slaine,  
> And that same Knight and Saluage standing by,  
> Vpon them two they fell with might and maine,  
> And on them layd so huge and horribly,  
> As if they would haue slaine them presently.  
> But the bold Prince defended him so well,  
> And their assault withstood so mightily,  
> That maugre all their might, he did repell,  
> And beat them back, whilest many vnderneath him fell.
>
> Yet he them still so sharpely did pursew,  
> That few of them he left aliue, which fled,  
> Those euill tidings to their Lord to shew.  
> Who hearing how his people badly sped,  
> Came forth in hast: where when as with the dead  
> He saw the ground all strow'd, and that same Knight  
> And saluage with their bloud fresh steeming red,  
> He woxe nigh mad with wrath and fell despight,  
> And with reprochfull words him thus bespake on hight;
>
> Art thou he, traytor, that with treason vile,  
> Hast slaine my men in this vnmanly maner,  
> And now triumphest in the piteous spoile  
> Of these poore folk, whose soules with black dishonor  
> And foule defame doe decke thy bloudy baner?  
> The meede whereof shall shortly be thy shame,  
> And wretched end, which still attendeth on her.  
> With that him selfe to battell he did frame;  
> So did his forty yeomen, which there with him came.
>
> With dreadfull force they all did him assaile,  
> And round about with boystrous strokes oppresse,  
> That on his shield did rattle like to haile  
> In a great tempest; that in such distresse,  
> He wist not to which side him to addresse.  
> And euermore that crauen cowherd Knight  
> Was at his backe with heartlesse heedinesse,  
> Wayting if he vnwares him murther might:  
> For cowardize doth still in villany delight.
>
> Whereof whenas the Prince was well aware,  
> He to him turnd with furious intent,  
> And him against his powre gan to prepare;  
> Like a fierce Bull, that being busie bent  
> To fight with many foes about him ment,  
> Feeling some curre behinde his heeles to bite,  
> Turnes him about with fell auengement;  
> So likewise turnde the Prince vpon the Knight,  
> And layd at him amaine with all his will and might.
>
> Who when he once his dreadfull strokes had tasted,  
> Durst not the furie of his force abyde,  
> But turn'd abacke, and to retyre him hasted  
> Through the thick prease, there thinking him to hyde.  
> But when the Prince had once him plainely eyde,  
> He foot by foot him followed alway,  
> Ne would him suffer once to shrinke asyde,  
> But ioyning close, huge lode at him did lay:  
> Who flying still did ward, and warding fly away.
>
> But when his foe he still so eger saw,  
> Vnto his heeles himselfe he did betake,  
> Hoping vnto some refuge to withdraw:  
> Ne would the Prince him euer foot forsake,  
> Where so he went, but after him did make.  
> He fled from roome to roome, from place to place,  
> Whylest euery ioynt for dread of death did quake,  
> Still looking after him, that did him chace;  
> That made him euermore increase his speedie pace.
>
> At last he vp into the chamber came,  
> Whereas his loue was sitting all alone,  
> Wayting what tydings of her folke became.  
> There did the Prince him ouertake anone,  
> Crying in vaine to her, him to bemone;  
> And with his sword him on the head did smyte,  
> That to the ground he fell in senselesse swone:  
> Yet whether thwart or flatly it did lyte,  
> The tempred steele did not into his braynepan byte.
>
> Which when the Ladie saw, with great affright  
> She starting vp, began to shrieke aloud,  
> And with her garment couering him from sight,  
> Seem'd vnder her protection him to shroud;  
> And falling lowly at his feet, her bowd  
> Vpon her knee, intreating him for grace,  
> And often him besought, and prayd, and vowd;  
> That with the ruth of her so wretched case,  
> He stayd his second strooke, and did his hand abase.
>
> Her weed she then withdrawing, did him discouer,  
> Who now come to himselfe, yet would not rize,  
> But still did lie as dead, and quake, and quiuer,  
> That euen the Prince his basenesse did despize,  
> And eke his Dame him seeing in such guize,  
> Gan him recomfort, and from ground to reare.  
> Who rising vp at last in ghastly wize,  
> Like troubled ghost did dreadfully appeare,  
> As one that had no life him left through former feare.
>
> Whom when the Prince so deadly saw dismayd,  
> He for such basenesse shamefully him shent,  
> And with sharpe words did bitterly vpbrayd;  
> Vile cowheard dogge, now doe I much repent,  
> That euer I this life vnto thee lent,  
> Whereof thou caytiue so vnworthie art;  
> That both thy loue, for lacke of hardiment,  
> And eke thy selfe, for want of manly hart,  
> And eke all knights hast shamed with this knightlesse part.
>
> Yet further hast thou heaped shame to shame,  
> And crime to crime, by this thy cowheard feare.  
> For first it was to thee reprochfull blame,  
> To erect this wicked custome, which I heare,  
> Gainst errant Knights and Ladies thou dost reare,  
> Whom when thou mayst, thou dost of arms despoile,  
> Or of their vpper garment, which they weare:  
> Yet doest thou not with manhood, but with guile  
> Maintaine this euill vse, thy foes thereby to foile.
>
> And lastly in approuance of thy wrong,  
> To shew such faintnesse and foule cowardize,  
> Is greatest shame: for oft it falles, that strong  
> And valiant knights doe rashly enterprize,  
> Either for fame, or else for exercize,  
> A wrongfull quarrell to maintaine by fight;  
> Yet haue, through prowesse and their braue emprize,  
> Gotten great worship in this worldes sight.  
> For greater force there needs to maintaine wrong, then right.
>
> Yet since thy life vnto this Ladie fayre  
> I giuen haue, liue in reproch and scorne;  
> Ne euer armes, ne euer knighthood dare  
> Hence to professe: for shame is to adorne  
> With so braue badges one so basely borne;  
> But onely breath sith that I did forgiue.  
> So hauing from his crauen bodie torne  
> Those goodly armes, he them away did giue  
> And onely suffred him this wretched life to liue.
>
> There whilest he thus was setling things aboue,  
> Atwene that Ladie myld and recreant knight,  
> To whom his life he graunted for her loue,  
> He gan bethinke him, in what perilous plight  
> He had behynd him left that saluage wight,  
> Amongst so many foes, whom sure he thought  
> By this quite slaine in so vnequall fight:  
> Therefore descending backe in haste, he sought  
> If yet he were aliue, or to destruction brought.
>
> There he him found enuironed about  
> With slaughtred bodies, which his hand had slaine,  
> And laying yet a fresh with courage stout  
> Vpon the rest, that did aliue remaine;  
> Whom he likewise right sorely did constraine,  
> Like scattred sheepe, to seeke for safetie,  
> After he gotten had with busie paine  
> Some of their weapons, which thereby did lie,  
> With which he layd about, and made them fast to flie.
>
> Whom when the Prince so felly saw to rage,  
> Approching to him neare, his hand he stayd,  
> And sought, by making signes, him to asswage:  
> Whom them perceiuing, streight to him obayd,  
> As to his Lord, and downe his weapons layd,  
> As if he long had to his heasts bene trayned.  
> Thence he him brought away, and vp conuayd  
> Into the chamber, where that Dame remayned  
> With her vnworthy knight, who ill him entertayned.
>
> Whom when the Saluage saw from daunger free,  
> Sitting beside his Ladie there at ease,  
> He well remembred, that the same was hee,  
> Which lately sought his Lord for to displease:  
> Tho all in rage, he on him streight did seaze,  
> As if he would in peeces him haue rent;  
> And were not, that the Prince did him appeaze,  
> He had not left one limbe of him vnrent:  
> But streight he held his hand at his commaundement.
>
> Thus hauing all things well in peace ordayned,  
> The Prince himselfe there all that night did rest,  
> Where him *Blandina* fayrely entertayned,  
> With all the courteous glee and goodly feast,  
> The which for him she could imagine best.  
> For well she knew the wayes to win good will  
> Of euery wight, that were not too infest,  
> And how to please the minds of good and ill,  
> Through tempering of her words & lookes by wondrous skill.
>
> Yet were her words and lookes but false and fayned,  
> To some hid end to make more easie way,  
> Or to allure such fondlings, whom she trayned  
> Into her trap vnto their owne decay:  
> Thereto, when needed, she could weepe and pray,  
> And when her listed, she could fawne and flatter;  
> Now smyling smoothly, like to sommers day,  
> Now glooming sadly, so to cloke her matter;  
> Yet were her words but wynd, & all her teares but water.
>
> Whether such grace were giuen her by kynd,  
> As women wont their guilefull wits to guyde;  
> Or learn'd the art to please, I doe not fynd.  
> This well I wote, that she so well applyde  
> Her pleasing tongue, that soone she pacifyde  
> The wrathfull Prince, & wrought her husbands peace,  
> Who nathelesse not therewith satisfyde,  
> His rancorous despight did not releasse,  
> Ne secretly from thought of fell reuenge surceasse.
>
> For all that night, the whyles the Prince did rest  
> In carelesse couch, not weeting what was ment,  
> He watcht in close awayt with weapons prest,  
> Willing to worke his villenous intent  
> On him, that had so shamefully him shent:  
> Yet durst he not for very cowardize  
> Effect the same, whylest all the night was spent.  
> The morrow next the Prince did early rize,  
> And passed forth, to follow his first enterprise.
