*Cant. V.*

> *Artegall fights with Radigund  
> And is subdewd by guile:  
> He is by her emprisoned,  
> But wrought by Clarins wile.*

> S O soone as day forth dawning from the East,  
> Nights humid curtaine from the heauens withdrew,  
> And earely calling forth both man and beast,  
> Comaunded them their daily workes renew,  
> These noble warriors, mindefull to pursew  
> The last daies purpose of their vowed fight,  
> Them selues thereto preparde in order dew;  
> The Knight, as best was seeming for a Knight,  
> And th'Amazon, as best it likt her selfe to dight.
>
> All in a Camis light of purple silke  
> Wouen vppon with siluer, subtly wrought,  
> And quilted vppon sattin white as milke,  
> Trayled with ribbands diuersly distraught  
> Like as the workeman had their courses taught;  
> Which was short tucked for light motion  
> Vp to her ham, but when she list, it raught  
> Downe to her lowest heele, and thereuppon  
> She wore for her defence a mayled habergeon.
>
> And on her legs she painted buskins wore,  
> Basted with bends of gold on euery side,  
> And mailes betweene, and laced close afore:  
> Vppon her thigh her Cemitare was tide,  
> With an embrodered belt of mickell pride;  
> And on her shoulder hung her shield, bedeckt  
> Vppon the bosse with stones, that shined wide,  
> As the faire Moone in her most full aspect,  
> That to the Moone it mote be like in each respect.
>
> So forth she came out of the citty gate,  
> With stately port and proud magnificence,  
> Guarded with many damzels, that did waite  
> Vppon her person for her sure defence,  
> Playing on shaumes and trumpets, that from hence  
> Their sound did reach vnto the heauens hight.  
> So forth into the field she marched thence,  
> Where was a rich Pauilion ready pight,  
> Her to receiue, till time they should begin the fight.
>
> Then forth came *Artegall* out of his tent,  
> All arm'd to point, and first the Lists did enter:  
> Soone after eke came she, with fell intent,  
> And countenaunce fierce, as hauing fully bent her,  
> That battels vtmost triall to aduenter.  
> The Lists were closed fast, to barre the rout  
> From rudely pressing to the middle center;  
> Which in great heapes them circled all about,  
> Wayting, how Fortune would resolue that daungerous dout.
>
> The Trumpets sounded, and the field began;  
> With bitter strokes it both began, and ended.  
> She at the first encounter on him ran  
> With furious rage, as if she had intended  
> Out of his breast the very heart haue rended:  
> But he that had like tempests often tride,  
> From that first flaw him selfe right well defended.  
> The more she rag'd, the more he did abide;  
> She hewd, she foynd, she lasht, she laid on euery side.
>
> Yet still her blowes he bore, and her forbore,  
> Weening at last to win aduantage new;  
> Yet still her crueltie increased more,  
> And though powre faild, her courage did accrew:  
> Which fayling he gan fiercely her pursew.  
> Like as a Smith that to his cunning feat  
> The stubborne mettall seeketh to subdew,  
> Soone as he feeles it mollifide with heat,  
> With his great yron sledge doth strongly on it beat.
>
> So did Sir *Artegall* vpon her lay,  
> As if she had an yron anduile beene,  
> That flakes of fire, bright as the sunny ray,  
> Out of her steely armes were flashing seene,  
> That all on fire ye would her surely weene.  
> But with her shield so well her selfe she warded,  
> From the dread daunger of his weapon keene,  
> That all that while her life she safely garded:  
> But he that helpe from her against her will discarded.
>
> For with his trenchant blade at the next blow  
> Halfe of her shield he shared quite away,  
> That halfe her side it selfe did naked show,  
> And thenceforth vnto daunger opened way.  
> Much was she moued with the mightie sway  
> Of that sad stroke, that halfe enrag'd she grew,  
> And like a greedie Beare vnto her pray,  
> With her sharpe Cemitare at him she flew,  
> That glauncing downe his thigh, the purple bloud forth drew.
>
> Thereat she gan to triumph with great boast,  
> And to vpbrayd that chaunce, which him misfell,  
> As if the prize she gotten had almost,  
> With spightfull speaches, fitting with her well;  
> That his great hart gan inwardly to swell  
> With indignation, at her vaunting vaine,  
> And at her strooke with puissance fearefull fell;  
> Yet with her shield she warded it againe,  
> That shattered all to peeces round about the plaine.
>
> Hauing her thus disarmed of her shield,  
> Vpon her helmet he againe her strooke,  
> That downe she fell vpon the grassie field,  
> In sencelesse swoune, as if her life forsooke,  
> And pangs of death her spirit ouertooke.  
> Whom when he saw before his foote prostrated,  
> He to her lept with deadly dreadfull looke,  
> And her sunshynie helmet soone vnlaced,  
> Thinking at once both head and helmet to haue raced.
>
> But when as he discouered had her face,  
> He saw his senses straunge astonishment,  
> A miracle of natures goodly grace,  
> In her faire visage voide of ornament,  
> But bath'd in bloud and sweat together ment;  
> Which in the rudenesse of that euill plight,  
> Bewrayd the signes of feature excellent:  
> Like as the Moone in foggie winters night,  
> Doth seeme to be her selfe, though darkned be her light.
>
> At sight thereof his cruell minded hart  
> Empierced was with pittifull regard,  
> That his sharpe sword he threw from him apart,  
> Cursing his hand that had that visage mard:  
> No hand so cruell, nor no hart so hard,  
> But ruth of beautie will it mollifie.  
> By this vpstarting from her swoune, she star'd  
> A while about her with confused eye;  
> Like one that from his dreame is waked suddenlye.
>
> Soone as the knight she there by her did spy,  
> Standing with emptie hands all weaponlesse,  
> With fresh assault vpon him she did fly,  
> And gan renew her former cruelnesse:  
> And though he still retyr'd, yet nathelesse  
> With huge redoubled strokes she on him layd;  
> And more increast her outrage mercilesse,  
> The more that he with meeke intreatie prayd,  
> Her wrathful hand from greedy vengeance to haue stayd.
>
> Like as a Puttocke hauing spyde in sight  
> A gentle Faulcon sitting on an hill,  
> Whose other wing, now made vnmeete for flight,  
> Was lately broken by some fortune ill;  
> The foolish Kyte, led with licentious will,  
> Doth beat vpon the gentle bird in vaine,  
> With many idle stoups her troubling still:  
> Euen so did *Radigund* with bootlesse paine  
> Annoy this noble Knight, and sorely him constraine.
>
> Nought could he do, but shun the dred despight  
> Of her fierce wrath, and backward still retyre,  
> And with his single shield, well as he might,  
> Beare off the burden of her raging yre;  
> And euermore he gently did desyre,  
> To stay her stroks, and he himselfe would yield:  
> Yet nould she hearke, ne let him once respyre,  
> Till he to her deliuered had his shield,  
> And to her mercie him submitted in plaine field.
>
> So was he ouercome, not ouercome,  
> But to her yeelded of his owne accord;  
> Yet was he iustly damned by the doome  
> Of his owne mouth, that spake so warelesse word,  
> To be her thrall, and seruice her afford.  
> For though that he first victorie obtayned,  
> Yet after by abandoning his sword,  
> He wilfull lost, that he before attayned.  
> No fayrer conquest, then that with goodwill is gayned.
>
> Tho with her sword on him she flatling strooke,  
> In signe of true subiection to her powre,  
> And as her vassall him to thraldome tooke.  
> But *Terpine* borne to'a more vnhappy howre,  
> As he, on whom the lucklesse starres did lowre,  
> She causd to be attacht, and forthwith led  
> Vnto the crooke t'abide the balefull stowre,  
> From which he lately had through reskew fled:  
> Where he full shamefully was hanged by the hed.
>
> But when they thought on *Talus* hands to lay,  
> He with his yron flaile amongst them thondred,  
> That they were fayne to let him scape away,  
> Glad from his companie to be so sondred;  
> Whose presence all their troups so much encombred  
> That th'heapes of those, which he did wound and slay,  
> Besides the rest dismayd, might not be nombred:  
> Yet all that while he would not once assay,  
> To reskew his owne Lord, but thought it iust t'obay.
>
> Then tooke the Amazon this noble knight,  
> Left to her will by his owne wilfull blame,  
> And caused him to be disarmed quight,  
> Of all the ornaments of knightly name,  
> With which whylome he gotten had great fame:  
> In stead whereof she made him to be dight  
> In womans weedes, that is to manhood shame,  
> And put before his lap a napron white,  
> In stead of Curiets and bases fit for fight.
>
> So being clad, she brought him from the field,  
> In which he had bene trayned many a day,  
> Into a long large chamber, which was sield  
> With moniments of many knights decay,  
> By her subdewed in victorious fray:  
> Amongst the which she causd his warlike armes  
> Be hang'd on high, that mote his shame bewray;  
> And broke his sword, for feare of further harmes,  
> With which he wont to stirre vp battailous alarmes.
>
> There entred in, he round about him saw  
> Many braue knights, whose names right well he knew,  
> There bound t'obay that Amazons proud law,  
> Spinning and carding all in comely rew,  
> That his bigge hart loth'd so vncomely vew.  
> But they were forst through penurie and pyne,  
> To doe those workes, to them appointed dew:  
> For nought was giuen them to sup or dyne,  
> But what their hands could earne by twisting linnen twyne.
>
> Amongst them all she placed him most low,  
> And in his hand a distaffe to him gaue,  
> That he thereon should spin both flax and tow;  
> A sordid office for a mind so braue.  
> So hard it is to be a womans slaue.  
> Yet he it tooke in his owne selfes despight,  
> And thereto did himselfe right well behaue,  
> Her to obay, sith he his faith had plight,  
> Her vassall to become, if she him wonne in fight.
>
> Who had him seene, imagine mote thereby,  
> That whylome hath of *Hercules* bene told,  
> How for *Iolas* sake he did apply  
> His mightie hands, the distaffe vile to hold,  
> For his huge club, which had subdew'd of old  
> So many monsters, which the world annoyed;  
> His Lyons skin chaungd to a pall of gold,  
> In which forgetting warres, he onely ioyed  
> In combats of sweet loue, and with his mistresse toyed.
>
> Such is the crueltie of womenkynd,  
> When they haue shaken off the shamefast band,  
> With which wise Nature did them strongly bynd,  
> T'obay the heasts of mans well ruling hand,  
> That then all rule and reason they withstand,  
> To purchase a licentious libertie.  
> But vertuous women wisely vnderstand,  
> That they were borne to base humilitie,  
> Vnlesse the heauens them lift to lawfull soueraintie.
>
> Thus there long while continu'd *Artegall*,  
> Seruing proud *Radigund* with true subiection;  
> How euer it his noble heart did gall,  
> T'obay a womans tyrannous direction,  
> That might haue had of life or death election:  
> But hauing chosen, now he might not chaunge.  
> During which time, the warlike Amazon,  
> Whose wandring fancie after lust did raunge,  
> Gan cast a secret liking to this captiue straunge.
>
> Which long concealing in her couert brest,  
> She chaw'd the cud of louers carefull plight;  
> Yet could it not so thoroughly digest,  
> Being fast fixed in her wounded spright,  
> But it tormented her both day and night:  
> Yet would she not thereto yeeld free accord,  
> To serue the lowly vassall of her might,  
> And of her seruant make her souerayne Lord:  
> So great her pride, that she such basenesse much abhord.
>
> So much the greater still her anguish grew,  
> Through stubborne handling of her loue-sicke hart;  
> And still the more she stroue it to subdew,  
> The more she still augmented her owne smart,  
> And wyder made the wound of th'hidden dart.  
> At last when long she struggled had in vaine,  
> She gan to stoupe, and her proud mind conuert  
> To meeke obeysance of loues mightie raine,  
> And him entreat for grace, that had procur'd her paine.
>
> Vnto her selfe in secret she did call  
> Her nearest handmayd, whom she most did trust,  
> And to her said; *Clarinda* whom of all  
> I trust a liue, sith I thee fostred first;  
> Now is the time, that I vntimely must  
> Thereof make tryall, in my greatest need:  
> It is so hapned, that the heauens vniust,  
> Spighting my happie freedome, haue agreed,  
> To thrall my looser life, or my last bale to breed.
>
> With that she turn'd her head, as halfe abashed,  
> To hide the blush which in her visage rose,  
> And through her eyes like sudden lightning flashed,  
> Decking her cheeke with a vermilion rose:  
> But soone she did her countenance compose,  
> And to her turning, thus began againe;  
> This griefes deepe wound I would to thee disclose,  
> Thereto compelled through hart-murdring paine,  
> But dread of shame my doubtfull lips doth still restraine.
>
> Ah my deare dread (said then the faithfull Mayd)  
> Can dread of ought your dreadlesse hart withhold,  
> That many hath with dread of death dismayd,  
> And dare euen deathes most dreadfull face behold?  
> Say on my souerayne Ladie, and be bold;  
> Doth not your handmayds life at your foot lie?  
> Therewith much comforted, she gan vnfold  
> The cause of her conceiued maladie,  
> As one that would confesse, yet faine would it denie.
>
> *Clarin* (sayd she) thou seest yond Fayry Knight,  
> Whom not my valour, but his owne braue mind  
> Subiected hath to my vnequall might;  
> What right is it, that he should thraldome find,  
> For lending life to me a wretch vnkind;  
> That for such good him recompence with ill?  
> Therefore I cast, how I may him vnbind,  
> And by his freedome get his free goodwill;  
> Yet so, as bound to me he may continue still.
>
> Bound vnto me, but not with such hard bands  
> Of strong compulsion, and streight violence,  
> As now in miserable state he stands;  
> But with sweet loue and sure beneuolence,  
> Voide of malitious mind, or foule offence.  
> To which if thou canst win him any way,  
> Without discouerie of my thoughts pretence,  
> Both goodly meede of him it purchase may,  
> And eke with gratefull seruice me right well apay.
>
> Which that thou mayst the better bring to pas,  
> Loe here this ring, which shall thy warrant bee,  
> And token true to old *Eumenias*,  
> From time to time, when thou it best shalt see,  
> That in and out thou mayst haue passage free.  
> Goe now, *Clarinda*, well thy wits aduise,  
> And all thy forces gather vnto thee;  
> Armies of louely lookes, and speeches wise,  
> With which thou canst euen *Ioue* himselfe to loue entise.
>
> The trustie Mayd, conceiuing her intent,  
> Did with sure promise of her good indeuour,  
> Giue her great comfort, and some harts content.  
> So from her parting, she thenceforth did labour  
> By all the meanes she might, to curry fauour  
> With th'Elfin Knight, her Ladies best beloued;  
> With daily shew of courteous kind behauiour,  
> Euen at the markewhite of his hart she roued,  
> And with wide glauncing words, one day she thus him proued.
>
> Vnhappie Knight, vpon whose hopelesse state  
> Fortune enuying good, hath felly frowned,  
> And cruell heauens haue heapt an heauy fate;  
> I rew that thus thy better dayes are drowned  
> In sad despaire, and all thy senses swowned  
> In stupid sorow, sith thy iuster merit  
> Might else haue with felicitie bene crowned:  
> Looke vp at last, and wake thy dulled spirit,  
> To thinke how this long death thou mightest disinherit.
>
> Much did he maruell at her vncouth speach,  
> Whose hidden drift he could not well perceiue;  
> And gan to doubt, least she him sought t'appeach  
> Of treason, or some guilefull traine did weaue,  
> Through which she might his wretched life bereaue.  
> Both which to barre, he with this answere met her;  
> Faire Damzell, that with ruth (as I perceaue)  
> Of my mishaps, art mou'd to wish me better,  
> For such your kind regard, I can but rest your detter.
>
> Yet weet ye well, that to a courage great  
> It is no lesse beseeming well, to beare  
> The storme of fortunes frowne, or heauens threat,  
> Then in the sunshine of her countenance cleare  
> Timely to ioy, and carrie comely cheare.  
> For though this cloud haue now me ouercast,  
> Yet doe I not of better times despeyre;  
> And, though (vnlike) they should for euer last,  
> Yet in my truthes assurance I rest fixed fast.
>
> But what so stonie mind (she then replyde)  
> But if in his owne powre occasion lay,  
> Would to his hope a windowe open wyde,  
> And to his fortunes helpe make readie way?  
> Vnworthy sure (quoth he) of better day,  
> That will not take the offer of good hope,  
> And eke pursew, if he attaine it may.  
> Which speaches she applying to the scope  
> Of her intent, this further purpose to him shope.
>
> Then why doest not, thou ill aduized man,  
> Make meanes to win thy libertie forlorne,  
> And try if thou by faire entreatie, can  
> Moue *Radigund*? who though she still haue worne  
> Her dayes in warre, yet (weet thou) was not borne  
> Of Beares and Tygres, nor so saluage mynded,  
> As that, albe all loue of men she scorne,  
> She yet forgets, that she of men was kynded:  
> And sooth oft seene, that proudest harts base loue hath blynded.
>
> Certes *Clarinda*, not of cancred will,  
> (Sayd he) nor obstinate disdainefull mind,  
> I haue forbore this duetie to fulfill:  
> For well I may this weene, by that I fynd,  
> That she a Queene, and come of Princely kynd,

> But want of meanes hath bene mine onely let,  
> From seeking fauour, where it doth abound;  
> Which if I might by your good office get,  
> I to your selfe should rest for euer bound,  
> And readie to deserue, what grace I found.  
> She feeling him thus bite vpon the bayt,  
> Yet doubting least his hold was but vnsound,  
> And not well fastened, would not strike him strayt,  
> But drew him on with hope, fit leasure to awayt.
>
> But foolish Mayd, whyles heedlesse of the hooke,  
> She thus oft times was beating off and on,  
> Through slipperie footing, fell into the brooke,  
> And there was caught to her confusion.  
> For seeking thus to salue the Amazon,  
> She wounded was with her deceipts owne dart,  
> And gan thenceforth to cast affection,  
> Conceiued close in her beguiled hart,  
> To *Artegall*, through pittie of his causelesse smart.
>
> Yet durst she not disclose her fancies wound,  
> Ne to himselfe, for doubt of being sdayned,  
> Ne yet to any other wight on ground,  
> For feare her mistresse shold haue knowledge gayned,  
> But to her selfe it secretly retayned,  
> Within the closet of her couert brest:  
> The more thereby her tender hart was payned.  
> Yet to awayt fit time she weened best,  
> And fairely did dissemble her sad thoughts vnrest.
>
> One day her Ladie, calling her apart,  
> Gan to demaund of her some tydings good,  
> Touching her loues successe, her lingring smart.  
> Therewith she gan at first to change her mood,  
> As one adaw'd, and halfe confused stood;  
> But quickly she it ouerpast, so soone  
> As she her face had wypt, to fresh her blood:  
> Tho gan she tell her all, that she had donne,  
> And all the wayes she sought, his loue for to haue wonne.
>
> But sayd, that he was obstinate and sterne,  
> Scorning her offers and conditions vaine;  
> Ne would be taught with any termes, to lerne  
> So fond a lesson, as to loue againe.  
> Die rather would he in penurious paine,  
> And his abridged dayes in dolour wast,  
> Then his foes loue or liking entertaine:  
> His resolution was both first and last,  
> His bodie was her thrall, his hart was freely plast.
>
> Which when the cruell Amazon perceiued,  
> She gan to storme, and rage, and rend her gall,  
> For very fell despight, which she conceiued,  
> To be so scorned of a base borne thrall,  
> Whose life did lie in her least eye-lids fall;  
> Of which she vow'd with many a cursed threat,  
> That she therefore would him ere long forestall.  
> Nathlesse when calmed was her furious heat,  
> She chang'd that threatfull mood, & mildly gan entreat.
>
> What now is left *Clarinda*? what remaines,  
> That we may compasse this our enterprize?  
> Great shame to lose so long employed paines,  
> And greater shame t'abide so great misprize,  
> With which he dares our offers thus despize.  
> Yet that his guilt the greater may appeare,  
> And more my gratious mercie by this wize,  
> I will a while with his first folly beare,  
> Till thou haue tride againe, & tempted him more neare.
>
> Say, and do all, that may thereto preuaile;  
> Leaue nought vnpromist, that may him perswade,  
> Life, freedome, grace, and gifts of great auaile,  
> With which the Gods themselues are mylder made:  
> Thereto adde art, euen womens witty trade,  
> The art of mightie words, that men can charme;  
> With which in case thou canst him not inuade,  
> Let him feele hardnesse of thy heauie arme:  
> Who will not stoupe with good, shall be made stoupe with harme.
>
> Some of his diet doe from him withdraw;  
> For I him find to be too proudly fed.  
> Giue him more labour, and with streighter law,  
> That he with worke may be forwearied.  
> Let him lodge hard, and lie in strawen bed,  
> That may pull downe the courage of his pride;  
> And lay vpon him, for his greater dread,  
> Cold yron chaines, with which let him be tide;  
> And let, what euer he desires, be him denide.
>
> When thou hast all this doen, then bring me newes  
> Of his demeane: thenceforth not like a louer,  
> But like a rebell stout I will him vse.  
> For I resolue this siege not to giue ouer,  
> Till I the conquest of my will recouer.  
> So she departed, full of griefe and sdaine,  
> Which inly did to great impatience moue her.  
> But the false mayden shortly turn'd againe  
> Vnto the prison, where her hart did thrall remaine.
>
> There all her subtill nets she did vnfold,  
> And all the engins of her wit display;  
> In which she meant him warelesse to enfold,  
> And of his innocence to make her pray.  
> So cunningly she wrought her crafts assay,  
> That both her Ladie, and her selfe withall,  
> And eke the knight attonce she did betray:  
> But most the knight, whom she with guilefull call  
> Did cast for to allure, into her trap to fall.
>
> As a bad Nurse, which fayning to receiue  
> In her owne mouth the food, ment for her chyld,  
> Withholdes it to her selfe, and doeth deceiue  
> The infant, so for want of nourture spoyld:  
> Euen so *Clarinda* her owne Dame beguyld,  
> And turn'd the trust, which was in her affyde,  
> To feeding of her priuate fire, which boyld  
> Her inward brest, and in her entrayles fryde,  
> The more that she it sought to couer and to hyde.
>
> For comming to this knight, she purpose fayned,  
> How earnest suit she earst for him had made  
> Vnto her Queene, his freedome to haue gayned;  
> But by no meanes could her thereto perswade:  
> But that in stead therof, she sternely bade  
> His miserie to be augmented more,  
> And many yron bands on him to lade.  
> All which nathlesse she for his loue forbore:  
> So praying him t'accept her seruice euermore.
>
> And more then that, she promist that she would,  
> In case she might finde fauour in his eye,  
> Deuize how to enlarge him out of hould.  
> The Fayrie glad to gaine his libertie,  
> Can yeeld great thankes for such her curtesie,  
> And with faire words, fit for the time and place,  
> To feede the humour of her maladie;  
> Promist, if she would free him from that case,  
> He wold by all good means he might, deserue such grace.
>
> So daily he faire semblant did her shew,  
> Yet neuer meant he in his noble mind,  
> To his owne absent loue to be vntrew:  
> Ne euer did deceiptfull *Clarin* find  
> In her false hart, his bondage to vnbind;  
> But rather how she mote him faster tye.  
> Therefore vnto her mistresse most vnkind  
> She daily told, her loue he did defye,  
> And him she told, her Dame his freedome did denye.
>
> Yet thus much friendship she to him did show,  
> That his scarse diet somewhat was amended,  
> And his worke lessened, that his loue mote grow:  
> Yet to her Dame him still she discommended,  
> That she with him mote be the more offended.  
> Thus he long while in thraldome there remayned,  
> Of both beloued well, but litle frended;  
> Vntill his owne true loue his freedome gayned,  
> Which in an other Canto will be best contayned.
