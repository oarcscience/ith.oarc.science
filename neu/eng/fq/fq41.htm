<blockquote>
<i>Blandamour winnes false Florimell,<br>
Paridell for her striues,<br>
They are accorded: Agape<br>
doth lengthen her sonnes liues.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
F
Irebrand of hell first tynd in Phlegeton,<br>
By thousand furies, and from thence out throwen<br>
Into this world, to worke confusion,<br>
And set it all on fire by force vnknowen,<br>
Is wicked discord, whose small sparkes once blowen<br>
None but a God or godlike man can slake;<br>
Such as was <i>Orpheus</i>, that when strife was growen<br>
Amongst those famous ympes of Greece, did take<br>
His siluer Harpe in hand, and shortly friends them make.<p>

Or such as that celestiall Psalmist was,<br>
That when the wicked feend his Lord tormented,<br>
With heauenly notes, that did all other pas,<br>
The outrage of his furious fit relented.<br>
Such Musicke is wise words with time concented,<br>
To moderate stiffe minds, disposd to striue:<br>
Such as that prudent Romane well inuented,<br>
What time his people into partes did riue,<br>
Them reconcyld againe, and to their homes did driue.<p>

Such vs'd wise <i>Glauce</i> to that wrathfull knight,<br>
To calme the tempest of his troubled thought:<br>
Yet <i>Blandamour</i> with termes of foule despight,<br>
And <i>Paridell</i> her scornd, and set at nought,<br>
As old and crooked and not good for ought.<br>
Both they vnwise, and warelesse of the euill,<br>
That by themselues vnto themselues is wrought,<br>
Through that false witch, and that foule aged dreuill,<br>
The one a feend, the other an incarnate deuill.<p>

With whom as they thus rode accompanide,<br>
They were encountred of a lustie Knight,<br>
That had a goodly Ladie by his side,<br>
To whom he made great dalliance and delight.<br>
It was to weete the bold Sir <i>Ferraugh</i> hight,<br>
He that from <i>Braggadocchio</i> whilome reft<br>
The snowy <i>Florimell</i>, whose beautie bright<br>
Made him seeme happie for so glorious theft;<br>
Yet was it in due triall but a wandring weft.<p>

Which when as <i>Blandamour</i>, whose fancie light<br>
Was alwaies flitting as the wauering wind,<br>
After each beautie, that appeard in sight,<br>
Beheld, eftsoones it prickt his wanton mind<br>
With sting of lust, that reasons eye did blind,<br>
That to Sir <i>Paridell</i> these words he sent;<br>
Sir knight why ride ye dumpish thus behind,<br>
Since so good fortune doth to you present<br>
So fayre a spoyle, to make you ioyous meriment?<p>

But <i>Paridell</i> that had too late a tryall<br>
Of the bad issue of his counsell vaine,<br>
List not to hearke, but made this faire denyall;<br>
Last turne was mine, well proued to my paine,<br>
This now be yours, God send you better gaine.<br>
Whose scoffed words he taking halfe in scorne,<br>
Fiercely forth prickt his steed as in disdaine,<br>
Against that Knight, ere he him well could torne<br>
By meanes whereof he hath him lightly ouerborne.<p>

Who with the sudden stroke astonisht sore,<br>
Vpon the ground a while in slomber lay;<br>
The whiles his loue away the other bore,<br>
And shewing her, did <i>Paridell</i> vpbray;<br>
Lo sluggish Knight the victors happie pray:<br>
So fortune friends the bold: whom <i>Paridell</i><br>
Seeing so faire indeede, as he did say,<br>
His hart with secret enuie gan to swell,<br>
And inly grudge at him, that he had sped so well.<p>

Nathlesse proud man himselfe the other deemed,<br>
Hauing so peerelesse paragon ygot:<br>
For sure the fayrest <i>Florimell</i> him seemed,<br>
To him was fallen for his happie lot,<br>
Whose like aliue on earth he weened not:<br>
Therefore he her did court, did serue, did wooe,<br>
With humblest suit that he imagine mot,<br>
And all things did deuise, and all things dooe,<br>
That might her loue prepare, and liking win theretoo.<p>

She in regard thereof him recompenst<br>
With golden words, and goodly countenance,<br>
And such fond fauours sparingly dispenst:<br>
Sometimes him blessing with a light eye-glance,<br>
And coy lookes tempring with loose dalliance;<br>
Sometimes estranging him in sterner wise,<br>
That hauing cast him in a foolish trance,<br>
He seemed brought to bed in Paradise,<br>
And prou'd himselfe most foole, in what he seem'd most wise.<p>

So great a mistresse of her art she was,<br>
And perfectly practiz'd in womans craft,<br>
That though therein himselfe he thought to pas,<br>
And by his false allurements wylie draft<br>
Had thousand women of their loue beraft,<br>
Yet now he was surpriz'd: for that false spright,<br>
Which that same witch had in this forme engraft,<br>
Was so expert in euery subtile slight,<br>
That it could ouerreach the wisest earthly wight.<p>

Yet he to her did dayly seruice more,<br>
And dayly more deceiued was thereby;<br>
Yet <i>Paridell</i> him enuied therefore,<br>
As seeming plast in sole felicity:<br>
So blind is lust, false colours to descry.<br>
But <i>Ate</i> soone discouering his desire,<br>
And finding now fit opportunity<br>
To stirre vp strife, twixt loue and spight and ire,<br>
Did priuily put coles vnto his secret fire.<p>

By sundry meanes thereto she prickt him forth,<br>
Now with remembrance of those spightfull speaches,<br>
Now with opinion of his owne more worth,<br>
Now with recounting of like former breaches<br>
Made in their friendship, as that Hag him teaches:<br>
And euer when his passion is allayd,<br>
She it reuiues and new occasion reaches:<br>
That on a time as they together way'd,<br>
He made him open chalenge, and thus boldly sayd.<p>

Too boastfull <i>Blandamour</i>, too long I beare<br>
The open wrongs, thou doest me day by day;<br>
Well know'st thou, whe&tilde; we friendship first did sweare,<br>
The couenant was, that euery spoyle or pray<br>
Should equally be shard betwixt vs tway:<br>
Where is my part then of this Ladie bright,<br>
Whom to thy selfe thou takest quite away?<br>
Render therefore therein to me my right,<br>
Or answere for thy wrong, as shall fall out in fight.<p>

Exceeding wroth thereat was <i>Blandamour</i>,<br>
And gan this bitter answere to him make;<br>
Too foolish <i>Paridell</i>, that fayrest floure<br>
Wouldst gather faine, and yet no paines wouldst take:<br>
But not so easie will I her forsake;<br>
This hand her wonne, this hand shall her defend.<br>
With that they gan their shiuering speares to shake,<br>
And deadly points at eithers breast to bend,<br>
Forgetfull each to haue bene euer others frend.<p>

Their firie Steedes with so vntamed forse<br>
Did beare them both to fell auenges end,<br>
That both their speares with pitilesse remorse,<br>
Through shield and mayle, and haberieon did wend,<br>
And in their flesh a griesly passage rend,<br>
That with the furie of their owne affret,<br>
Each other horse and man to ground did send;<br>
Where lying still a while, both did forget<br>
The perilous present stownd, in which their liues were set.<p>

As when two warlike Brigandines at sea,<br>
With murdrous weapons arm'd to cruell fight,<br>
Doe meete together on the watry lea,<br>
They stemme ech other with so fell despight,<br>
That with the shocke of their owne heedlesse might,<br>
Their wooden ribs are shaken nigh a sonder;<br>
They which from shore behold the dreadfull sight<br>
Of flashing fire, and heare the ordenance thonder,<br>
Do greatly stand amaz'd at such vnwonted wonder.<p>

At length they both vpstarted in amaze;<br>
As men awaked rashly out of dreme,<br>
And round about themselues a while did gaze,<br>
Till seeing her, that <i>Florimell</i> did seme,<br>
In doubt to whom she victorie should deeme,<br>
Therewith their dulled sprights they edgd anew,<br>
And drawing both their swords with rage extreme,<br>
Like two mad mastiffes each on other flew,<br>
And shields did share, &amp; mailes did rash, and helmes did hew.<p>

So furiously each other did assayle,<br>
As if their soules they would attonce haue rent<br>
Out of their brests, that streames of bloud did rayle<br>
Adowne, as if their springes of life were spent;<br>
That all the ground with purple bloud was sprent,<br>
And all their armours staynd with bloudie gore,<br>
Yet scarcely once to breath would they relent,<br>
So mortall was their malice and so sore,<br>
Become of fayned friendship which they vow'd afore.<p>

And that which is for Ladies most befitting,<br>
To stint all strife, and foster friendly peace,<br>
Was from those Dames so farre and so vnfitting,<br>
As that in stead of praying them surcease,<br>
They did much more their cruelty encrease;<br>
Bidding them fight for honour of their loue,<br>
And rather die then Ladies cause release.<br>
With which vaine termes so much they did the&tilde; moue,<br>
That both resolu'd the last extremities to proue.<p>

There they I weene would fight vntill this day,<br>
Had not a Squire, euen he the Squire of Dames,<br>
By great aduenture trauelled that way;<br>
Who seeing both bent to so bloudy games,<br>
And both of old well knowing by their names,<br>
Drew nigh, to weete the cause of their debate:<br>
And first laide on those Ladies thousand blames,<br>
That did not seeke t'appease their deadly hate,<br>
But gazed on their harmes, not pittying their estate.<p>

And then those Knights he humbly did beseech,<br>
To stay their hands, till he a while had spoken:<br>
Who lookt a little vp at that his speech,<br>
Yet would not let their battell so be broken,<br>
Both greedie fiers on other to be wroken.<br>
Yet he to them so earnestly did call,<br>
And them coniur'd by some well knowen token,<br>
That they at last their wrothfull hands let fall,<br>
Content to heare him speake, and glad to rest withall.<p>

First he desir'd their cause of strife to see:<br>
They said, it was for loue of <i>Florimell</i>.<br>
Ah gentle knights (quoth he) how may that bee,<br>
And she so farre astray, as none can tell.<br>
Fond Squire, full angry then sayd <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
Seest not the Ladie there before thy face?<br>
He looked backe, and her aduizing well,<br>
Weend as he said, by that her outward grace,<br>
That fayrest <i>Florimell</i> was present there in place.<p>

Glad man was he to see that ioyous sight,<br>
For none aliue but ioy'd in <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
And lowly to her lowting thus behight;<br>
Fayrest of faire, that fairenesse doest excell,<br>
This happie day I haue to greete you well,<br>
In which you safe I see, whom thousand late,<br>
Misdoubted lost through mischiefe that befell;<br>
Long may you liue in health and happie state.<br>
She litle answer'd him, but lightly did aggrate.<p>

Then turning to those Knights, he gan a new;<br>
And you Sir <i>Blandamour</i> and <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
That for this Ladie present in your vew,<br>
Haue rays'd this cruell warre and outrage fell,<br>
Certes me seemes bene not aduised well,<br>
But rather ought in friendship for her sake<br>
To ioyne your force, their forces to repell,<br>
That seeke perforce her from you both to take,<br>
And of your gotten spoyle their owne triumph to make.<p>

Thereat Sir <i>Blandamour</i> with countenance sterne,<br>
All full of wrath, thus fiercely him bespake;<br>
A read thou Squire, that I the man may learne,<br>
That dare fro me thinke <i>Florimell</i> to take.<br>
Not one (quoth he) but many doe partake<br>
Herein, as thus.  It lately so befell,<br>
That <i>Satyran</i> a girdle did vptake,<br>
Well knowne to appertaine to <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
Which for her sake he wore, as him beseemed well.<p>

But when as she her selfe was lost and gone,<br>
Full many knights, that loued her like deare,<br>
Thereat did greatly grudge, that he alone<br>
That lost faire Ladies ornament should weare,<br>
And gan therefore close spight to him to beare:<br>
Which he to shun, and stop vile enuies sting,<br>
Hath lately caus'd to be proclaim'd each where<br>
A solemne feast, with publike turneying,<br>
To which all knights with them their Ladies are to bring.<p>

And of them all she that is fayrest found,<br>
Shall haue that golden girdle for reward,<br>
And of those Knights who is most stout on ground,<br>
Shall to that fairest Ladie be prefard.<br>
Since therefore she her selfe is now your ward,<br>
To you that ornament of hers pertaines,<br>
Against all those, that chalenge it to gard,<br>
And saue her honour with your ventrous paines;<br>
That shall you win more glory, then ye here find gaines.<p>

When they the reason of his words had hard,<br>
They gan abate the rancour of their rage,<br>
And with their honours and their loues regard,<br>
The furious flames of malice to asswage.<br>
Tho each to other did his faith engage,<br>
Like faithfull friends thenceforth to ioyne in one<br>
With all their force, and battell strong to wage<br>
Gainst all those knights, as their professed fone,<br>
That chaleng'd ought in <i>Florimell</i>, saue they alone.<p>

So well accorded forth they rode together<br>
In friendly sort, that lasted but a while;<br>
And of all old dislikes they made faire weather,<br>
Yet all was forg'd and spred with golden foyle,<br>
That vnder it hidde hate and hollow guyle.<br>
Ne certes can that friendship long endure,<br>
How euer gay and goodly be the style,<br>
That doth ill cause or euill end enure:<br>
For vertue is the band, that bindeth harts most sure.<p>

Thus as they marched all in close disguise,<br>
Of fayned loue, they chaunst to ouertake<br>
Two knights, that lincked rode in louely wise,<br>
As if they secret counsels did partake;<br>
And each not farre behinde him had his make,<br>
To weete, two Ladies of most goodly hew,<br>
That twixt themselues did gentle purpose make<br>
Vnmindfull both of that discordfull crew,<br>
The which with speedie pace did after them pursew.<p>

Who as they now approched nigh at hand,<br>
Deeming them doughtie as they did appeare,<br>
They sent that Squire afore, to vnderstand,<br>
What mote they be: who viewing them more neare<br>
Returned readie newes, that those same weare<br>
Two of the prowest Knights in Faery lond;<br>
And those two Ladies their two louers deare,<br>
Couragious <i>Cambell</i>, and stout <i>Triamond</i>,<br>
With <i>Canacee</i> and <i>Cambine</i> linckt in louely bond.<p>

Whylome as antique stories tellen vs,<br>
Those two were foes the fellonest on ground,<br>
And battell made the dreddest daungerous,<br>
That euer shrilling trumpet did resound;<br>
Though now their acts be no where to be found,<br>
As that renowmed Poet them compyled,<br>
With warlike numbers and Heroicke sound,<br>
Dan <i>Chaucer</i>, well of English vndefyled,<br>
On Fames eternall beadroll worthie to be fyled.<p>

But wicked Time that all good thoughts doth waste,<br>
And workes of noblest wits to nought out weare,<br>
That famous moniment hath quite defaste,<br>
And robd the world of threasure endlesse deare,<br>
The which mote haue enriched all vs heare.<br>
O cursed Eld the cankerworme of writs,<br>
How may these rimes, so rude as doth appeare,<br>
Hope to endure, sith workes of heauenly wits<br>
Are quite deuourd, and brought to nought by little bits?<p>

Then pardon, O most sacred happie spirit,<br>
That I thy labours lost may thus reuiue,<br>
And steale from thee the meede of thy due merit,<br>
That none durst euer whilest thou wast aliue,<br>
And being dead in vaine yet many striue:<br>
Ne dare I like, but through infusion sweete<br>
Of thine owne spirit, which doth in me suruiue,<br>
I follow here the footing of thy feete,<br>
That with thy meaning so I may the rather meete.<p>

<i>Cambelloes</i> sister was fayre <i>Canacee</i>,<br>
That was the learnedst Ladie in her dayes,<br>
Well seene in euerie science that mote bee,<br>
And euery secret worke of natures wayes,<br>
In wittie riddles, and in wise soothsayes,<br>
In power of herbes, and tunes of beasts and burds;<br>
And, that augmented all her other prayse,<br>
She modest was in all her deedes and words,<br>
And wondrous chast of life, yet lou'd of Knights &amp; Lords.<p>

Full many Lords, and many Knights her loued,<br>
Yet she to none of them her liking lent,<br>
Ne euer was with fond affection moued,<br>
But rul'd her thoughts with goodly gouernement,<br>
For dread of blame and honours blemishment;<br>
And eke vnto her lookes a law she made,<br>
That none of them once out of order went,<br>
But like to warie Centonels well stayd,<br>
Still watcht on euery side, of secret foes affrayd.<p>

So much the more as she refusd to loue,<br>
So much the more she loued was and sought,<br>
That oftentimes vnquiet strife did moue<br>
Amongst her louers, and great quarrels wrought,<br>
That oft for her in bloudie armes they fought.<br>
Which whenas <i>Cambell</i>, that was stout and wise,<br>
Perceiu'd would breede great mischiefe, he bethought<br>
How to preuent the perill that mote rise,<br>
And turne both him and her to honour in this wise.<p>

One day, when all that troupe of warlike wooers<br>
Assembled were, to weet whose she should bee,<br>
All mightie men and dreadfull derring dooers,<br>
(The harder it to make them well agree)<br>
Amongst them all this end he did decree;<br>
That of them all, which loue to her did make,<br>
They by consent should chose the stoutest three,<br>
That with himselfe should combat for her sake,<br>
And of them all the victour should his sister take.<p>

Bold was the chalenge, as himselfe was bold,<br>
And courage full of haughtie hardiment,<br>
Approued oft in perils manifold,<br>
Which he atchieu'd to his great ornament:<br>
But yet his sisters skill vnto him lent<br>
Most confidence and hope of happie speed,<br>
Conceiued by a ring, which she him sent,<br>
That mongst the manie vertues, which we reed,<br>
Had power to staunch al wounds, that mortally did bleed.<p>

Well was that rings great vertue knowen to all,<br>
That dread thereof, and his redoubted might<br>
Did all that youthly rout so much appall,<br>
That none of them durst vndertake the fight;<br>
More wise they weend to make of loue delight,<br>
Then life to hazard for faire Ladies looke;<br>
And yet vncertaine by such outward sight,<br>
Though for her sake they all that perill tooke,<br>
Whether she would them loue, or in her liking brooke.<p>

Amongst those knights there were three brethren bold,<br>
Three bolder brethren neuer were yborne,<br>
Borne of one mother in one happie mold,<br>
Borne at one burden in one happie morne;<br>
Thrise happie mother, and thrise happie morne,<br>
That bore three such, three such not to be fond;<br>
Her name was <i>Agape</i> whose children werne<br>
All three as one, the first hight <i>Priamond</i>,<br>
The second <i>Dyamond</i>, the youngest <i>Triamond</i>.<p>

Stout <i>Priamond</i>, but not so strong to strike,<br>
Strong <i>Diamond</i>, but not so stout a knight,<br>
But <i>Triamond</i> was stout and strong alike:<br>
On horsebacke vsed <i>Triamond</i> to fight,<br>
And <i>Priamond</i> on foote had more delight,<br>
But horse and foote knew <i>Diamond</i> to wield:<br>
With curtaxe vsed <i>Diamond</i> to smite,<br>
And <i>Triamond</i> to handle speare and shield,<br>
But speare and curtaxe both vsd <i>Priamond</i> in field.<p>

These three did loue each other dearely well,<br>
And with so firme affection were allyde,<br>
As if but one soule in them all did dwell,<br>
Which did her powre into three parts diuyde;<br>
Like three faire branches budding farre and wide,<br>
That from one roote deriu'd their vitall sap:<br>
And like that roote that doth her life diuide,<br>
Their mother was, and had full blessed hap,<br>
These three so noble babes to bring forth at one clap.<p>

Their mother was a Fay, and had the skill<br>
Of secret things, and all the powres of nature,<br>
Which she by art could vse vnto her will,<br>
And to her seruice bind each liuing creature;<br>
Through secret vnderstanding of their feature.<br>
Thereto she was right faire, when so her face<br>
She list discouer, and of goodly stature;<br>
But she as Fayes are wont, in priuie place<br>
Did spend her dayes, and lov'd in forests wyld to space.<p>

There on a day a noble youthly knight<br>
Seeking aduentures in the saluage wood,<br>
Did by great fortune get of her the sight;<br>
As she sate carelesse by a cristall flood,<br>
Combing her golden lockes, as seemd her good:<br>
And vnawares vpon her laying hold,<br>
That stroue in vaine him long to haue withstood,<br>
Oppressed her, and there (as it is told)<br>
Got these three louely babes, that prov'd three cha&tilde;pions bold.<p>

Which she with her long fostred in that wood,<br>
Till that to ripenesse of mans state they grew:<br>
Then shewing forth signes of their fathers blood,<br>
They loued armes, and knighthood did ensew,<br>
Seeking aduentures, where they anie knew.<br>
Which when their mother saw, she gan to dout<br>
Their safetie, least by searching daungers new,<br>
And rash prouoking perils all about,<br>
Their days mote be abridged through their corage stout.<p>

Therefore desirous th'end of all their dayes<br>
To know, and them t'enlarge with long extent,<br>
By wondrous skill, and many hidden wayes,<br>
To the three fatall sisters house she went.<br>
Farre vnder ground from tract of liuing went,<br>
Downe in the bottome of the deepe <i>Abysse</i>,<br>
Where <i>Demogorgon</i> in dull darknesse pent,<br>
Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,<br>
The hideous <i>Chaos</i> keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.<p>

There she them found, all sitting round about<br>
The direfull distaffe standing in the mid,<br>
And with vnwearied fingers drawing out<br>
The lines of life, from liuing knowledge hid.<br>
Sad <i>Clotho</i> held the rocke, the whiles the thrid<br>
By griesly <i>Lachesis</i> was spun with paine,<br>
That cruell <i>Atropos</i> eftsoones vndid,<br>
With cursed knife cutting the twist in twaine:<br>
Most wretched men, whose dayes depend on thrids so vaine.<p>

She them saluting, there by them sate still,<br>
Beholding how the thrids of life they span:<br>
And when at last she had beheld her fill,<br>
Trembling in heart, and looking pale and wan,<br>
Her cause of comming she to tell began.<br>
To whom fierce <i>Atropos</i>, Bold Fay, that durst<br>
Come see the secret of the life of man,<br>
Well worthie thou to be of <i>Ioue</i> accurst,<br>
And eke thy childrens thrids to be asunder burst.<p>

Whereat she sore affrayd, yet her besought<br>
To graunt her boone, and rigour to abate,<br>
That she might see her childre&tilde;s thrids forth brought,<br>
And know the measure of their vtmost date,<br>
To them ordained by eternall fate.<br>
Which <i>Clotho</i> graunting, shewed her the same:<br>
That when she saw, it did her much amate,<br>
To see their thrids so thin, as spiders frame,<br>
And eke so short, that seemd their ends out shortly came.<p>

She then began them humbly to intreate,<br>
To draw them longer out, and better twine,<br>
That so their liues might be prolonged late.<br>
But <i>Lachesis</i> thereat gan to repine,<br>
And sayd, Fond dame that deem'st of things diuine<br>
As of humane, that they may altred bee,<br>
And chaung'd at pleasure for those impes of thine.<br>
Not so; for what the Fates do once decree,<br>
Not all the gods can chaunge, nor <i>Ioue</i> him self can free.<p>

Then since (quoth she) the terme of each mans life<br>
For nought may lessened nor enlarged bee,<br>
Graunt this, that when ye shred with fatall knife<br>
His line, which is the eldest of the three,<br>
Which is of them the shortest, as I see,<br>
Eftsoones his life may passe into the next;<br>
And when the next shall likewise ended bee,<br>
That both their liues may likewise be annext<br>
Vnto the third, that his may so be trebly wext.<p>

They graunted it; and then that carefull Fay<br>
Departed thence with full contended mynd;<br>
And comming home, in warlike fresh aray<br>
Them found all three according to their kynd:<br>
But vnto them what destinie was assynd,<br>
Or how their liues were eekt, she did not tell;<br>
But euermore, when she fit time could fynd,<br>
She warned them to tend their safeties well,<br>
And loue each other deare, what euer them befell.<p>

So did they surely during all their dayes,<br>
And neuer discord did amongst them fall;<br>
Which much augmented all their other praise.<br>
And now t'increase affection naturall,<br>
In loue of <i>Canacee</i> they ioyned all:<br>
Vpon which ground this same great battell grew,<br>
Great matter growing of beginning small;<br>
The which for length I will not here pursew,<br>
But rather will reserue it for a Canto new.<p>
