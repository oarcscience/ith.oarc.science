*Cant. IX.*

> *Arthur and Artegall catch Guyle  
> whom Talus doth dismay,  
> They to Mercillaes pallace come,  
> and see her rich array.*

> W Hat Tygre, or what other saluage wight  
> Is so exceeding furious and fell,  
> As Wrong, when it hath arm'd it selfe with might?  
> Not fit mongst men, that doe with reason mell,  
> But mongst wyld beasts and saluage woods to dwell;  
> Where still the stronger doth the weake deuoure,  
> And they that most in boldnesse doe excell,  
> Are dreadded most, and feared for their powre:  
> Fit for *Adicia*, there to build her wicked bowre.
>
> There let her wonne farre from resort of men,  
> Where righteous *Artegall* her late exyled;  
> There let her euer keepe her damned den,  
> Where none may be with her lewd parts defyled,  
> Nor none but beasts may be of her despoyled:  
> And turne we to the noble Prince, where late  
> We did him leaue, after that he had foyled  
> The cruell Souldan, and with dreadfull fate  
> Had vtterly subuerted his vnrighteous state.
>
> Where hauing with Sir *Artegall* a space  
> Well solast in that Souldans late delight,  
> They both resoluing now to leaue the place,  
> Both it and all the wealth therein behight  
> Vnto that Damzell in her Ladies right,  
> And so would haue departed on their way.  
> But she them woo'd by all the meanes she might,  
> And earnestly besought, to wend that day  
> With her, to see her Ladie thence no farre away.
>
> By whose entreatie both they ouercommen,  
> Agree to goe with her, and by the way,  
> (As often falles) of sundry things did commen.  
> Mongst which that Damzell did to them bewray  
> A straunge aduenture, which not farre thence lay;  
> To weet a wicked villaine, bold and stout,  
> Which wonned in a rocke not farre away,  
> That robbed all the countrie there about,  
> And brought the pillage home, whence none could get it out.
>
> Thereto both his owne wylie wit, (she sayd)  
> And eke the fastnesse of his dwelling place,  
> Both vnassaylable, gaue him great ayde:  
> For he so crafty was to forge and face,  
> So light of hand, and nymble of his pace,  
> So smooth of tongue, and subtile in his tale.  
> That could deceiue one looking in his face;  
> Therefore by name *Malengin* they him call,  
> Well knowen by his feates, and famous ouer all.
>
> Through these his slights he many doth confound,  
> And eke the rocke, in which he wonts to dwell,  
> Is wondrous strong, and hewen farre vnder ground  
> A dreadfull depth, how deepe no man can tell;  
> But some doe say, it goeth downe to hell.  
> And all within, it full of wyndings is,  
> And hidden wayes, that scarse an hound by smell  
> Can follow out those false footsteps of his,  
> Ne none can backe returne, that once are gone amis.
>
> Which when those knights had heard, their harts gan earne,  
> To vnderstand that villeins dwelling place,  
> And greatly it desir'd of her to learne,  
> And by which way they towards it should trace.  
> Were not (sayd she) that it should let your pace  
> Towards my Ladies presence by you ment,  
> I would you guyde directly to the place.  
> Then let not that (said they) stay your intent;  
> For neither will one foot, till we that carle haue hent.
>
> So froth they past, till they apporched ny  
> Vnto the rocke, where was the villains won:  
> Which when the Damzell neare at hand did spy,  
> She warn'd the knights thereof: who thereupon  
> Gan to aduize, what best were to be done.  
> So both agreed, to send that mayd afore,  
> Where she might sit nigh to the den alone,  
> Wayling, and raysing pittifull vprore,  
> As if she did some great calamitie deplore.
>
> With noyse whereof when as the caytiue carle  
> Should issue forth, in hope to find some spoyle,  
> They in awayt would closely him ensnarle,  
> Ere to his den he backward could recoyle,  
> And so would hope him easily to foyle.  
> The Damzell straight went, as she was directed,  
> Vnto the rocke, and there vpon the soyle  
> Hauing her selfe in wretched wize abiected,  
> Gan weepe and wayle, as if great griefe had her affected.
>
> The cry whereof entring the hollow caue,  
> Eftsoones brought forth the villaine, as they ment,  
> With hope of her some wishfull boot to haue.  
> Full dreadfull wight he was, as euer went  
> Vpon the earth, with hollow eyes deepe pent,  
> And long curld locks, that downe his shoulders shagged,  
> And on his backe an vncouth vestiment  
> Made of straunge stuffe, but all to worne and ragged,  
> And vnderneath his breech was all to torne and iagged.
>
> And in his hand an huge long staffe he held,  
> Whose top was arm'd with many an yron hooke,  
> Fit to catch hold of all that he could weld,  
> Or in the compasse of his clouches tooke;  
> And euer round about he cast his looke.  
> Als at his backe a great wyde net he bore,  
> With which he seldome fished at the brooke,  
> But vsd to fish for fooles on the dry shore,  
> Of which he in faire weather wont to take great store.
>
> Him when the damzell saw fast by her side,  
> So vgly creature, she was nigh dismayd,  
> And now for helpe aloud in earnest cride.  
> But when the villaine saw her so affrayd,  
> He gan with guilefull words her to perswade,  
> To banish feare, and with *Sardonian* smyle  
> Laughing on her, his false intent to shade,  
> Gan forth to lay his bayte her to beguyle,  
> That from her self vnwares he might her steale the whyle.
>
> Like as the fouler on his guilefull pype  
> Charmes to the birds full many a pleasant lay,  
> That they the whiles may take lesse heedie keepe,  
> How he his nets doth for their ruine lay:  
> So did the villaine to her prate and play,  
> And many pleasant trickes before her show,  
> To turne her eyes from his intent away:  
> For he in slights and iugling feates did flow,  
> And of legierdemayne the mysteries did know.
>
> To which whilest she lent her intentiue mind,  
> He suddenly his net vpon her threw,  
> That ouersprad her like a puffe of wind;  
> And snatching her soone vp, ere well she knew,  
> Ran with her fast away vnto his mew,  
> Crying for helpe aloud. But when as ny  
> He came vnto his caue, and there did vew  
> The armed knights stopping his passage by,  
> He threw his burden downe, and fast away did fly.
>
> But *Artegall* him after did pursew,  
> The whiles the Prince there kept the entrance still:  
> Vp to the rocke he ran, and thereon flew  
> Like a wyld Gote, leaping from hill to hill,  
> And dauncing on the craggy cliffes at will;  
> That deadly daunger seem'd in all mens sight,  
> To tempt such steps, where footing was so ill:  
> Ne ought auayled for the armed knight,  
> To thinke to follow him, that was so swift and light.
>
> Which when he saw, his yron man he sent,  
> To follow him; for he was swift in chace.  
> He him pursewd, where euer that he went,  
> Both ouer rockes, and hilles, and euery place,  
> Where so he fled, he followd him apace:  
> So that he shortly forst him to forsake  
> The hight, and downe descend vnto the base.  
> There he him courst a fresh, and soone did make  
> To leaue his proper forme, and other shape to take.
>
> Into a Foxe himselfe he first did tourne;  
> But he him hunted like a Foxe full fast:  
> Then to a bush himselfe he did transforme,  
> But he the bush did beat, till that at last  
> Into a bird it chaung'd, and from him past,  
> Flying from tree to tree, from wand to wand:  
> But he then stones at it so long did cast,  
> That like a stone it fell vpon the land,  
> But he then tooke it vp, and held fast in his hand.
>
> So he it brought with him vnto the knights,  
> And to his Lord Sir *Artegall* it lent,  
> Warning him hold it fast, for feare of slights.  
> Who whilest in hand it gryping hard he hent,  
> Into a Hedgehogge all vnwares it went,  
> And prickt him so, that he away it threw.  
> Then gan it runne away incontinent,  
> Being returned to his former hew:  
> But *Talus* soone him ouertooke, and backward drew.
>
> But when as he would to a snake againe  
> Haue turn'd himselfe, he with his yron flayle  
> Gan driue at him, with so huge might and maine,  
> That all his bones, as small as sandy grayle  
> He broke, and did his bowels disentrayle;  
> Crying in vaine for helpe, when helpe was past.  
> So did deceipt the selfe deceiuer fayle,  
> There they him left a carrion outcast;  
> For beasts and foules to feede vpon for their repast.
>
> Thence forth they passed with that gentle Mayd,  
> To see her Ladie, as they did agree.  
> To which when she approched, thus she sayd;  
> Loe now, right noble knights, arriu'd ye bee  
> Nigh to the place, which ye desir'd to see:  
> There shall ye see my souerayne Lady Queene  
> Most sacred wight, most debonayre and free,  
> That euer yet vpon this earth was seene,  
> Or that with Diademe hath euer crowned beene.
>
> The gentle knights reioyced much to heare  
> The prayses of that Prince so manifold:  
> And passing litle further, commen were,  
> Where they a stately pallace did behold,  
> Of pompous show, much more then she had told;  
> With many towres, and tarras mounted hye,  
> And all their tops bright glistering with gold,  
> That seemed to outshine the dimmed skye,  
> And with their brightnesse daz'd the straunge beholders eye.
>
> There they alighting, by that Damzell were  
> Directed in, and shewed all the sight:  
> Whose porch, that most magnificke did appeare,  
> Stood open wyde to all men day and night;  
> Yet warded well by one of mickle might,  
> That sate thereby, with gyantlike resemblance,  
> To keepe out guyle, and malice, and despight,  
> That vnder shew oftimes of fayned semblance,  
> Are wont in Princes courts to worke great scath and hindrance.
>
> His name was *Awe*; by whom they passing in  
> Went vp the hall, that was a large wyde roome,  
> All full of people making troublous din,  
> And wondrous noyse, as if that there were some,  
> Which vnto them was dealing righteous doome.  
> By whom they passing, through the thickest preasse,  
> The marshall of the hall to them did come;  
> His name hight *Order*, who commaunding peace,  
> Them guyded through the throng, that did their clamors ceasse.
>
> They ceast their clamors vpon them to gaze;  
> Whom seeing all in armour bright as day,  
> Straunge there to see, it did them much amaze,  
> And with vnwonted terror halfe affray,  
> For neuer saw they there the like array.  
> Ne euer was the name of warre there spoken,  
> But ioyous peace and quietnesse alway,  
> Dealing iust iudgements, that mote not be broken  
> For any brybes, or threates of any to be wroken.
>
> There as they entred at the Scriene, they saw  
> Some one, whose tongue was for his trespasse vyle  
> Nayld to a post, adiudged so by law:  
> For that therewith he falsely did reuyle,  
> And foule blaspheme that Queene for forged guyle,  
> Both with bold speaches, which he blazed had,  
> And with lewd poems, which he did compyle;  
> For the bold title of a Poet bad  
> He on himselfe had ta'en, and rayling rymes had sprad.
>
> Thus there he stood, whylest high ouer his head,  
> There written was the purport of his sin,  
> In cyphers strange, that few could rightly read,  
> BON FONT: but *bon* that once had written bin,  
> Was raced out, and *Mal* was now put in.  
> So now *Malfont* was plainely to be red;  
> Eyther for th'euill, which he did therein,  
> Or that he likened was to a welhed  
> Of euill words, and wicked sclaunders by him shed.
>
> They passing by, were guyded by degree  
> Vnto the presence of that gratious Queene:  
> Who sate on high, that she might all men see,  
> And might of all men royally be seene:  
> Vpon a throne of gold full bright and sheene,  
> Adorned all with gemmes of endlesse price,  
> As either might for wealth haue gotten bene,  
> Or could be fram'd by workmans rare deuice;  
> And all embost with Lyons and with Flourdelice.
>
> All ouer her a cloth of state was spred,  
> Not of rich tissew, nor of cloth of gold,  
> Nor of ought else, that may be richest red,  
> But like a cloud, as likest may be told,  
> That her brode spreading wings did wyde vnfold;  
> Whose skirts were bordred with bright sunny beams,  
> Glistring like gold, amongst the plights enrold,  
> And here and there shooting forth siluer streames,  
> Mongst which crept litle Angels through the glittering gleames.
>
> Seemed those litle Angels did vphold  
> The cloth of state, and on their purpled wings  
> Did beare the pendants, through their nimblesse bold:  
> Besides a thousand more of such, as sings  
> Hymnes to high God, and carols heauenly things,  
> Encompassed the throne, on which she sate:  
> She Angel-like, the heyre of ancient kings  
> And mightie Conquerors, in royall state,  
> Whylest kings and kesars at her feet did them prostrate.
>
> Thus she did sit in souerayne Maiestie,  
> Holding a Scepter in her royall hand,  
> The sacred pledge of peace and clemencie,  
> With which high God had blest her happie land,  
> Maugre so many foes, which did withstand.  
> But at her feet her sword was likewise layde,  
> Whose long rest rusted the bright steely brand;  
> Yet when as foes enforst, or friends sought ayde,  
> She could it sternely draw, that all the world dismayde.
>
> And round about, before her feet there sate  
> A beuie of faire Virgins clad in white,  
> That goodly seem'd t'adorne her royall state,  
> All louely daughters of high *Ioue*, that hight,  
> *Litae*, by him begot in loues delight,  
> Vpon the righteous *Themis*: those they say  
> Vpon *Ioues* iudgement seat wayt day and night,  
> And when in wrath he threats the worlds decay,  
> They doe his anger calme, and cruell vengeance stay.
>
> They also doe by his diuine permission  
> Vpon the thrones of mortall Princes tend,  
> And often treat for pardon and remission  
> To suppliants, through frayltie which offend.  
> Those did vpon *Mercillaes* throne attend:  
> Iust *Dice*, wise *Eunomie*, myld *Eirene*,  
> And them amongst, her glorie to commend,  
> Sate goodly *Temperance* in garments clene,  
> And sacred *Reuerence*, yborne of heauenly strene,
>
> Thus did she sit in royall rich estate,  
> Admyr'd of many, honoured of all,  
> Whylest vnderneath her feete, there as she sate,  
> An huge great Lyon lay, that mote appall  
> An hardie courage, like captiued thrall,  
> With a strong yron chaine and coller bound,  
> That once he could not moue, nor quich at all;  
> Yet did he murmure with rebellious sound,  
> And softly royne, when saluage choler gan redound.
>
> So sitting high in dreaded souerayntie,  
> Those two strange knights were to her presence brought;  
> Who bowing low before her Maiestie,  
> Did to her myld obeysance, as they ought,  
> And meekest boone, that they imagine mought.  
> To whom she eke inclyning her withall,  
> As a faire stoupe of her high soaring thought,  
> A chearefull countenance on them let fall,  
> Yet tempred with some maiestie imperiall.
>
> As the bright sunne, what time his fierie teme  
> Towards the westerne brim begins to draw,  
> Gins to abate the brightnesse of his beme,  
> And feruour of his flames somewhat adaw:  
> So did this mightie Ladie, when she saw  
> Those two strange knights such homage to her make,  
> Bate somewhat of that Maiestie and awe,  
> That whylome wont to doe so many quake,  
> And with more myld aspect those two to entertake.
>
> Now at that instant, as occasion fell,  
> When these two stranger knights arriu'd in place,  
> She was about affaires of common wele,  
> Dealing of Iustice with indifferent grace,  
> And hearing pleas of people meane and base.  
> Mongst which as then, there was for to be heard  
> The tryall of a great and weightie case,  
> Which on both sides was then debating hard:  
> But at the sight of these, those were a while debard.
>
> But after all her princely entertayne,  
> To th'hearing of that former cause in hand,  
> Her selfe eftsoones she gan conuert againe;  
> Which that those knights likewise mote vnderstand,  
> And witnesse forth aright in forrain land,  
> Taking them vp vnto her stately throne,  
> Where they mote heare the matter throughly scand  
> On either part, she placed th'one on th'one,  
> The other on the other side, and neare them none.
>
> Then was there brought, as prisoner to the barre,  
> A Ladie of great countenance and place,  
> But that she it with foule abuse did marre;  
> Yet did appeare rare beautie in her face,  
> But blotted with condition vile and base,  
> That all her other honour did obscure,  
> And titles of nobilitie deface:  
> Yet in that wretched semblant, she did sure  
> The peoples great compassion vnto her allure.
>
> Then vp arose a person of deepe reach,  
> And rare in-sight, hard matters to reuele;  
> That well could charme his tongue, and time his speach  
> To all assayes; his name was called *Zele*:  
> He gan that Ladie strongly to appele  
> Of many haynous crymes, by her enured,  
> And with sharpe reasons rang her such a pele,  
> That those, whom she to pitie had allured,  
> He now t'abhorre and loath her person had procured.
>
> First gan he tell, how this that seem'd so faire  
> And royally arayd, *Duessa* hight,  
> That false *Duessa*, which had wrought great care,  
> And mickle mischiefe vnto many a knight,  
> By her beguyled, and confounded quight:  
> But not for those she now in question came,  
> Though also those mote question'd be aright,  
> But for vyld treasons, and outrageous shame,  
> Which she against the dred *Mercilla* oft did frame.
>
> For she whylome (as ye mote yet right well  
> Remember) had her counsels false conspyred,  
> With faithlesse *Blandamour* and *Paridell*,  
> (Both two her paramours, both by her hyred,  
> And both with hope of shadowes vaine inspyred.)  
> And with them practiz'd, how for to depryue  
> *Mercilla* of her crowne, by her aspyred,  
> That she might it vnto her selfe deryue,  
> And tryumph in their blood, whom she to death did dryue.
>
> But through high heauens grace, which fauour not  
> The wicked driftes of trayterous desynes,  
> Gainst loiall Princes, all this cursed plot,  
> Ere proofe it tooke, discouered was betymes,  
> And th'actours won the meede meet for their crymes.  
> Such be the meede of all, that by such mene  
> Vnto the type of kingdomes title clymes.  
> But false *Duessa* now vntitled Queene,  
> Was brought to her sad doome, as here was to be seene.
>
> Strongly did *Zele* her haynous fact enforce,  
> And many other crimes of foule defame  
> Against her brought, to banish all remorse,  
> And aggrauate the horror of her blame.  
> And with him to make part against her, came  
> Many graue persons, that against her pled;  
> First was a sage old Syre, that had to name  
> The *Kingdomes care*, with a white siluer hed,  
> That many high regards and reasons gainst her red.
>
> Then gan *Authority* her to appose  
> With peremptorie powre, that made all mute;  
> And then the law of *Nations* gainst her rose,  
> And reasons brought, that no man could refute;  
> Next gan *Religion* gainst her to impute  
> High Gods beheast, and powre of holy lawes;  
> Then gan the Peoples cry and Commons sute,  
> Importune care of their owne publicke cause;  
> And lastly *Iustice* charged her with breach of lawes.
>
> But then for her, on the contrarie part,  
> Rose many aduocates for her to plead:  
> First there came *Pittie*, with full tender hart,  
> And with her ioyn'd *Regard* of womanhead;  
> And then came *Daunger* threatning hidden dread,  
> And high alliance vnto forren powre;  
> Then came *Nobilitie* of birth, that bread  
> Great ruth through her misfortunes tragicke stowre;  
> And lastly *Griefe* did plead, and many teares forth powre.
>
> With the neare touch whereof in tender hart  
> The Briton Prince was sore empassionate,  
> And woxe inclined much vnto her part,  
> Through the sad terror of so dreadfull fate,  
> And wretched ruine of so high estate,  
> That for great ruth his courage gan relent.  
> Which when as *Zele* perceiued to abate,  
> He gan his earnest feruour to augment,  
> And many fearefull obiects to them to present.
>
> He gan t'efforce the euidence anew,  
> And new accusements to produce in place:  
> He brought forth that old hag of hellish hew,  
> The cursed *Ate*, brought her face to face,  
> Who priuie was, and partie in the case:  
> She, glad of spoyle and ruinous decay,  
> Did her appeach, and to her more disgrace,  
> The plot of all her practise did display,  
> And all her traynes, and all her treasons forth did lay.
>
> Then brought he forth, with griesly grim aspect,  
> Abhorred *Murder*, who with bloudie knyfe  
> Yet dropping fresh in hand did her detect,  
> And there with guiltie bloudshed charged ryfe:  
> Then brought he forth *Sedition*, breeding stryfe  
> In troublous wits, and mutinous vprore:  
> Then brought he forth *Incontinence* of lyfe,  
> Euen foule *Adulterie* her face before,  
> And lewd *Impietie*, that her accused sore.
>
> All which when as the Prince had heard and seene,  
> His former fancies ruth he gan repent,  
> And from her partie eftsoones was drawen cleene.  
> But *Artegall* with constant firme intent,  
> For zeale of Iustice was against her bent.  
> So was she guiltie deemed of them all.  
> Then *Zele* began to vrge her punishment,  
> And to their Queene for iudgement loudly call,  
> Vnto *Mercilla* myld for Iustice gainst the thrall.
>
> But she, whose Princely breast was touched nere  
> With piteous ruth of her so wretched plight,  
> Though plaine she saw by all, that she did heare,  
> That she of death was guiltie found by right,  
> Yet would not let iust vengeance on her light;  
> But rather let in stead thereof to fall  
> Few perling drops from her faire lampes of light;  
> The which she couering with her purple pall  
> Would haue the passion hid, and vp arose withall.
