<blockquote>
<i>The Squire of low degree releast<br>
Poeana takes to wife:<br>
Britomart fightes with many Knights,<br>
Prince Arthur stints their strife.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
H
Ard is the doubt, and difficult to deeme,<br>
When all three kinds of loue together meet,<br>
And doe dispart the hart with powre extreme,<br>
Whether shall weigh the balance downe; to weet<br>
The deare affection vnto kindred sweet,<br>
Or raging fire of loue to woman kind,<br>
Or zeale of friends combynd with vertues meet.<br>
But of them all the band of vertuous mind<br>
Me seemes the gentle hart should most assured bind.<p>

For naturall affection soone doth cesse,<br>
And quenched is with <i>Cupids</i> greater flame:<br>
But faithfull friendship doth them both suppresse,<br>
And them with maystring discipline doth tame,<br>
Through thoughts aspyring to eternall fame.<br>
For as the soule doth rule the earthly masse,<br>
And all the seruice of the bodie frame,<br>
So loue of soule doth loue of bodie passe,<br>
No lesse then perfect gold surmounts the meanest brasse.<p>

All which who list by tryall to assay,<br>
Shall in this storie find approued plaine;<br>
In which these Squires true friendship more did sway,<br>
Then either care of parents could refraine,<br>
Or loue of fairest Ladie could constraine.<br>
For though <i>Poeana</i> were as faire as morne,<br>
Yet did this trustie Squire with proud disdaine<br>
For his friends sake her offred fauours scorne,<br>
And she her selfe her syre, of whom she was yborne.<p>

Now after that Prince <i>Arthur</i> graunted had,<br>
To yeeld strong succour to that gentle swayne,<br>
Who now long time had lyen in prison sad,<br>
He gan aduise how best he mote darrayne<br>
That enterprize, for greatest glories gayne.<br>
That headlesse tyrants tronke he reard from ground,<br>
And hauing ympt the head to it agayne,<br>
Vpon his vsuall beast it firmely bound,<br>
And made it so to ride, as it aliue was found.<p>

Then did he take that chaced Squire, and layd<br>
Before the ryder, as he captiue were,<br>
And made his Dwarfe, though with vnwilling ayd,<br>
To guide the beast, that did his maister beare,<br>
Till to his castle they approched neare.<br>
Whom when the watch, that kept continuall ward<br>
Saw comming home; all voide of doubtfull feare,<br>
He running downe, the gate to him vnbard;<br>
Whom straight the Prince ensuing, in together far'd.<p>

There he did find in her delitious boure<br>
The faire <i>Poeana</i> playing on a Rote,<br>
Complayning of her cruell Paramoure,<br>
And singing all her sorrow to the note,<br>
As she had learned readily by rote.<br>
That with the sweetnesse of her rare delight,<br>
The Prince halfe rapt, began on her to dote:<br>
Till better him bethinking of the right,<br>
He her vnwares attacht, and captiue held by might.<p>

Whence being forth produc'd, when she perceiued<br>
Her owne deare sire, she cald to him for aide.<br>
But when of him no aunswere she receiued,<br>
But saw him sencelesse by the Squire vpstaide,<br>
She weened well, that then she was betraide:<br>
Then gan she loudly cry, and weepe, and waile,<br>
And that same Squire of treason to vpbraide.<br>
But all in vaine, her plaints might not preuaile,<br>
Ne none there was to reskue her, ne none to baile.<p>

Then tooke he that same Dwarfe, and him compeld<br>
To open vnto him the prison dore,<br>
And forth to bring those thrals, which there he held.<br>
Thence forth were brought to him aboue a score<br>
Of Knights and Squires to him vnknowne afore:<br>
All which he did from bitter bondage free,<br>
And vnto former liberty restore.<br>
Amongst the rest, that Squire of low degree<br>
Came forth full weake and wan, not like him selfe to bee.<p>

Whom soone as faire <i>AEmylia</i> beheld,<br>
And <i>Placidas</i>, they both vnto him ran,<br>
And him embracing fast betwixt them held,<br>
Striuing to comfort him all that they can,<br>
And kissing oft his visage pale and wan.<br>
That faire <i>Poeana</i> them beholding both,<br>
Gan both enuy, and bitterly to ban;<br>
Through iealous passion weeping inly wroth,<br>
To see the sight perforce, that both her eyes were loth.<p>

But when a while they had together beene,<br>
And diuersly conferred of their case,<br>
She, though full oft she both of them had seene<br>
A sunder, yet not euer in one place,<br>
Began to doubt, when she them saw embrace,<br>
Which was the captiue Squire she lou'd so deare,<br>
Deceiued through great likenesse of their face.<br>
For they so like in person did appeare,<br>
That she vneath discerned, whether whether weare.<p>

And eke the Prince, when as he them auized,<br>
Their like resemblaunce much admired there,<br>
And mazd how nature had so well disguized<br>
Her worke, and counterfet her selfe so nere,<br>
As if that by one patterne seene somewhere,<br>
She had them made a paragone to be,<br>
Or whether it through skill, or errour were.<br>
Thus gazing long, at them much wondred he,<br>
So did the other knights and Squires, which him did see.<p>

Then gan they ransacke that same Castle strong,<br>
In which he found great store of hoorded threasure,<br>
The which that tyrant gathered had by wrong<br>
And tortious powre, without respect or measure.<br>
Vpon all which the Briton Prince made seasure,<br>
And afterwards continu'd there a while,<br>
To rest him selfe, and solace in soft pleasure<br>
Those weaker Ladies after weary toile;<br>
To whom he did diuide part of his purchast spoile.<p>

And for more ioy, that captiue Lady faire<br>
The faire <i>Poeana</i> he enlarged free;<br>
And by the rest did set in sumptuous chaire,<br>
To feast and frollicke; nathemore would she<br>
Shew gladsome countenaunce nor pleasaunt glee:<br>
But grieued was for losse both of her sire,<br>
And eke of Lordship, with both land and fee:<br>
But most she touched was with griefe entire,<br>
For losse of her new loue, the hope of her desire.<p>

But her the Prince through his well wonted grace,<br>
To better termes of myldnesse did entreat,<br>
From that fowle rudenesse, which did her deface;<br>
And that same bitter corsiue, which did eat<br>
Her tender heart, and made refraine from meat,<br>
He with good thewes and speaches well applyde,<br>
Did mollifie, and calme her raging heat.<br>
For though she were most faire, and goodly dyde,<br>
Yet she it all did mar with cruelty and pride.<p>

And for to shut vp all in friendly loue,<br>
Sith loue was first the ground of all her griefe,<br>
That trusty Squire he wisely well did moue<br>
Not to despise that dame, which lou'd him liefe,<br>
Till he had made of her some better priefe,<br>
But to accept her to his wedded wife.<br>
Thereto he offred for to make him chiefe<br>
Of all her land and lordship during life:<br>
He yeelded, and her tooke; so stinted all their strife.<p>

From that day forth in peace and ioyous blis,<br>
They liu'd together long without debate:<br>
Ne priuate iarre, ne spite of enemis<br>
Could shake the safe assuraunce of their state.<br>
And she whom Nature did so faire create,<br>
That she mote match the fairest of her daies,<br>
Yet with lewd loues and lust intemperate<br>
Had it defaste; thenceforth reformd her waies,<br>
That all men much admyrde her change, and spake her praise.<p>

Thus when the Prince had perfectly compylde<br>
These paires of friends in peace and setled rest,<br>
Him selfe, whose minde did trauell as with chylde,<br>
Of his old loue, conceau'd in secret brest,<br>
Resolued to pursue his former quest;<br>
And taking leaue of all, with him did beare<br>
Faire <i>Amoret</i>, whom Fortune by bequest<br>
Had left in his protection whileare,<br>
Exchanged out of one into an other feare.<p>

Feare of her safety did her not constraine,<br>
For well she wist now in a mighty hond,<br>
Her person late in perill, did remaine,<br>
Who able was all daungers to withstond.<br>
But now in feare of shame she more did stond,<br>
Seeing her selfe all soly succourlesse,<br>
Left in the victors powre, like vassall bond;<br>
Whose will her weakenesse could no way represse,<br>
In case his burning lust should breake into excesse.<p>

But cause of feare sure had she none at all<br>
Of him, who goodly learned had of yore<br>
The course of loose affection to forstall,<br>
And lawlesse lust to rule with reasons lore;<br>
That all the while he by his side her bore,<br>
She was as safe as in a Sanctuary;<br>
Thus many miles they two together wore,<br>
To seeke their loues dispersed diuersly,<br>
Yet neither shewed to other their hearts priuity.<p>

At length they came, whereas a troupe of Knights<br>
They saw together skirmishing, as seemed:<br>
Sixe they were all, all full of fell despight,<br>
But foure of them the battell best beseemed,<br>
That which of them was best, mote not be deemed.<br>
Those foure were they, from whom false <i>Florimell</i><br>
By <i>Braggadochio</i> lately was redeemed.<br>
To weet, sterne <i>Druon</i>, and lewd <i>Claribell</i>,<br>
Loue-lauish <i>Blandamour</i>, and lustfull <i>Paridell</i>.<p>

<i>Druons</i> delight was all in single life,<br>
And vnto Ladies loue would lend no leasure:<br>
The more was <i>Claribell</i> enraged rife<br>
With feruent flames, and loued out of measure:<br>
So eke lou'd <i>Blandamour</i>, but yet at pleasure<br>
Would change his liking, and new Lemans proue:<br>
But <i>Paridell</i> of loue did make no threasure,<br>
But lusted after all, that him did moue.<br>
So diuersly these foure disposed were to loue.<p>

But those two other which beside them stoode,<br>
Were <i>Britomart</i>, and gentle <i>Scudamour</i>,<br>
Who all the while beheld their wrathfull moode,<br>
And wondred at their impacable stoure,<br>
Whose like they neuer saw till that same houre:<br>
So dreadfull strokes each did at other driue,<br>
And laid on load with all their might and powre,<br>
As if that euery dint the ghost would riue<br>
Out of their wretched corses, and their liues depriue.<p>

As when <i>Dan AEolus</i> in great displeasure,<br>
For losse of his deare loue by <i>Neptune</i> hent,<br>
Sends forth the winds out of his hidden threasure,<br>
Vpon the sea to wreake his fell intent;<br>
They breaking forth with rude vnruliment,<br>
From all foure parts of heauen doe rage full sore,<br>
And tosse the deepes, and teare the firmament,<br>
And all the world confound with wide vprore,<br>
As if in stead thereof they <i>Chaos</i> would restore.<p>

Cause of their discord, and so fell debate,<br>
Was for the loue of that same snowy maid,<br>
Whome they had lost in Turneyment of late,<br>
And seeking long, to weet which way she straid<br>
Met here together; where through lewd vpbraide<br>
Of <i>Ate</i> and <i>Duessa</i> they fell out,<br>
And each one taking part in others aide,<br>
This cruell conflict raised thereabout,<br>
Whose dangerous successe depended yet in dout.<p>

For sometimes <i>Paridell</i> and <i>Blandamour</i><br>
The better had, and bet the others backe,<br>
Eftsoones the others did the field recoure,<br>
And on their foes did worke full cruell wracke:<br>
Yet neither would their fiendlike fury slacke,<br>
But euermore their malice did augment;<br>
Till that vneath they forced were for lacke<br>
Of breath, their raging rigour to relent,<br>
And rest themselues for to recouer spirits spent.<p>

There gan they change their sides, and new parts take;<br>
For <i>Paridell</i> did take to <i>Druons</i> side,<br>
For old despight, which now forth newly brake<br>
Gainst <i>Blandamour</i>, whom alwaies he enuide:<br>
And <i>Blandamour</i> to <i>Claribell</i> relide.<br>
So all afresh gan former fight renew.<br>
As when two Barkes, this caried with the tide,<br>
That with the wind, contrary courses sew,<br>
If wind and tide doe change, their courses change anew.<p>

Thenceforth they much more furiously gan fare,<br>
As if but then the battell had begonne,<br>
Ne helmets bright, ne hawberks strong did spare,<br>
That through the clifts the vermeil bloud out sponne,<br>
And all adowne their riuen sides did ronne.<br>
Such mortall malice, wonder was to see<br>
In friends profest, and so great outrage donne:<br>
But sooth is said, and tride in each degree,<br>
Faint friends when they fall out, most cruell fomen bee.<p>

Thus they long while continued in fight,<br>
Till <i>Scudamour</i>, and that same Briton maide,<br>
By fortune in that place did chance to light:<br>
Whom soone as they with wrathfull eie bewraide,<br>
They gan remember of the fowle vpbraide,<br>
The which that Britonesse had to them donne,<br>
In that late Turney for the snowy maide;<br>
Where she had them both shamefully fordonne,<br>
And eke the famous prize of beauty from them wonne.<p>

Eftsoones all burning with a fresh desire,<br>
Of fell reuenge, in their malicious mood<br>
They from them selues gan turne their furious ire,<br>
And cruell blades yet steeming with whot bloud,<br>
Against those two let driue, as they were wood:<br>
Who wondring much at that so sodaine fit,<br>
Yet nought dismayd, them stoutly well withstood;<br>
Ne yeelded foote, ne once abacke did flit,<br>
But being doubly smitten likewise doubly smit.<p>

The warlike Dame was on her part assaid,<br>
Of <i>Claribell</i> and <i>Blandamour</i> attone;<br>
And <i>Paridell</i> and <i>Druon</i> fiercely laid<br>
At <i>Scudamour</i>, both his professed fone.<br>
Foure charged two, and two surcharged one;<br>
Yet did those two them selues so brauely beare,<br>
That the other litle gained by the lone,<br>
But with their owne repayed duely weare,<br>
And vsury withall: such gaine was gotten deare.<p>

Full oftentimes did <i>Britomart</i> assay<br>
To speake to them, and some emparlance moue;<br>
But they for nought their cruell hands would stay,<br>
Ne lend an eare to ought, that might behoue,<br>
As when an eager mastiffe once doth proue<br>
The tast of bloud of some engored beast,<br>
No words may rate, nor rigour him remoue<br>
From greedy hold of that his blouddy feast:<br>
So litle did they hearken to her sweet beheast.<p>

Whom when the Briton Prince a farre beheld<br>
With ods of so vnequall match opprest,<br>
His mighty heart with indignation sweld,<br>
And inward grudge fild his heroicke brest:<br>
Eftsoones him selfe he to their aide addrest,<br>
And thrusting fierce into the thickest preace,<br>
Diuided them, how euer loth to rest,<br>
And would them faine from battell to surceasse,<br>
With gentle words perswading them to friendly peace.<p>

But they so farre from peace or patience were,<br>
That all at once at him gan fiercely flie,<br>
And lay on load, as they him downe would beare;<br>
Like to a storme, which houers vnder skie<br>
Long here and there, and round about doth stie,<br>
At length breakes downe in raine, and haile, and sleet,<br>
First from one coast, till nought thereof be drie;<br>
And then another, till that likewise fleet;<br>
And so from side to side till all the world it weet.<p>

But now their forces greatly were decayd,<br>
The Prince yet being fresh vntoucht afore;<br>
Who them with speaches milde gan first disswade<br>
From such foule outrage, and them long forbore:<br>
Till seeing them through suffrance hartned more,<br>
Him selfe he bent their furies to abate,<br>
And layd at them so sharpely and so sore,<br>
That shortly them compelled to retrate,<br>
And being brought in daunger, to relent too late.<p>

But now his courage being throughly fired,<br>
He ment to make them know their follies prise,<br>
Had not those two him instantly desired<br>
T'asswage his wrath, and pardon their mesprise.<br>
At whose request he gan him selfe aduise<br>
To stay his hand, and of a truce to treat<br>
In milder tearmes, as list them to deuise:<br>
Mongst which the cause of their so cruell heat<br>
He did them aske, who all that passed gan repeat.<p>

And told at large how that same errant Knight,<br>
To weet faire <i>Britomart</i>, them late had foyled<br>
In open turney, and by wrongfull fight<br>
Both of their publicke praise had them despoyled,<br>
And also of their priuate loues beguyled;<br>
Of two full hard to read the harder theft.<br>
But she that wrongfull challenge soone assoyled,<br>
And shew'd that she had not that Lady reft,<br>
(As they supposd) but her had to her liking left.<p>

To whom the Prince thus goodly well replied;<br>
Certes sir Knight[s], ye seemen much to blame,<br>
To rip vp wrong, that battell once hath tried;<br>
Wherein the honor both of Armes ye shame,<br>
And eke the loue of Ladies foule defame;<br>
To whom the world this franchise euer yeelded,<br>
That of their loues choise they might freedom clame,<br>
And in that right should by all knights be shielded:<br>
Gainst which me seemes this war ye wrongfully haue wielded.<p>

And yet (quoth she) a greater wrong remaines:<br>
For I thereby my former loue haue lost,<br>
Whom seeking euer since with endlesse paines,<br>
Hath me much sorrow and much trauell cost;<br>
Aye me to see that gentle maide so tost.<br>
But <i>Scudamour</i> then sighing deepe, thus saide,<br>
Certes her losse ought me to sorrow most,<br>
Whose right she is, where euer she be straide,<br>
Through many perils wonne, and many fortunes waide.<p>

For from the first that I her loue profest,<br>
Vnto this houre, this present lucklesse howre,<br>
I neuer ioyed happinesse nor rest,<br>
But thus turmoild from one to other stowre,<br>
I wast my life, and doe my daies deuowre<br>
In wretched anguishe and incessant woe,<br>
Passing the measure of my feeble powre,<br>
That liuing thus, a wretch and louing so,<br>
I neither can my loue, ne yet my life forgo.<p>

Then good sir <i>Claribell</i> him thus bespake,<br>
Now were it not sir <i>Scudamour</i> to you,<br>
Dislikefull paine, so sad a taske to take,<br>
Mote we entreat you, sith this gentle crew<br>
Is now so well accorded all anew;<br>
That as we ride together on our way,<br>
Ye will recount to vs in order dew<br>
All that aduenture, which ye did assay<br>
For that faire Ladies loue: past perils well apay.<p>

So gan the rest him likewise to require,<br>
But <i>Britomart</i> did him importune hard,<br>
To take on him that paine: whose great desire<br>
He glad to satisfie, him selfe prepar'd<br>
To tell through what misfortune he had far'd,<br>
In that atchieuement, as to him befell.<br>
And all those daungers vnto them declar'd,<br>
Which sith they cannot in this Canto well<br>
Comprised be, I will them in another tell.<p>
