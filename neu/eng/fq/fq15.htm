<i>Babes bloudie hands may not be clensd,<br>
the face of golden Meane.<br>
Her sisters two Extremities:<br>
striue her to banish cleane.</i><p>

<blockquote> 
T
Hus when Sir <i>Guyon</i> with his faithfull guide<br>
Had with due rites and dolorous lament<br>
The end of their sad Tragedie vptyde,<br>
The little babe vp in his armes he hent;<br>
Who with sweet pleasance and bold blandishment<br>
Gan smyle on them, that rather ought to weepe,<br>
As carelesse of his woe, or innocent<br>
Of that was doen, that ruth emperced deepe<br>
In that knights heart, and wordes with bitter teares did steepe.<p>
 
Ah lucklesse babe, borne vnder cruell starre,<br>
And in dead parents balefull ashes bred,<br>
Full litle weenest thou, what sorrowes are<br>
Left thee for portion of thy liuelihed,<br>
Poore Orphane in the wide world scattered,<br>
As budding braunch rent from the natiue tree,<br>
And throwen forth, till it be withered:<br>
Such is the state of men: thus enter wee<br>
Into this life with woe, and end with miseree.<p>
 
Then soft himselfe inclyning on his knee<br>
Downe to that well, did in the water weene<br>
(So loue does loath disdainfull nicitee)<br>
His guiltie hands from bloudie gore to cleene,<br>
He washt them oft and oft, yet nought they beene<br>
For all his washing cleaner. Still he stroue,<br>
Yet still the litle hands were bloudie seene;<br>
The which him into great amaz'ment droue,<br>
And into diuerse doubt his wauering wonder cloue.<p>
 
He wist not whether blot of foule offence<br>
Might not be purgd with water nor with bath;<br>
Or that high God, in lieu of innocence,<br>
Imprinted had that token of his wrath,<br>
To shew how sore bloudguiltinesse he hat'th;<br>
Or that the charme and venim, which they druncke,<br>
Their bloud with secret filth infected hath,<br>
Being diffused through the senselesse truncke,<br>
That through the great contagion direfull deadly stunck.<p>
 
Whom thus at gaze, the Palmer gan to bord<br>
With goodly reason, and thus faire bespake;<br>
Ye bene right hard amated, gratious Lord,<br>
And of your ignorance great maruell make,<br>
Whiles cause not well conceiued ye mistake.<br>
But know, that secret vertues are infusd<br>
In euery fountaine, and in euery lake,<br>
Which who hath skill them rightly to haue chusd,<br>
To proofe of passing wonders hath full often vsd.<p>
 
Of those some were so from their sourse indewd<br>
By great Dame Nature, from whose fruitfull pap<br>
Their welheads spring, and are with moisture dewd;<br>
Which feedes each liuing plant with liquid sap,<br>
And filles with flowres faire <i>Floraes</i> painted lap:<br>
But other some by gift of later grace,<br>
Or by good prayers, or by other hap,<br>
Had vertue pourd into their waters bace,<br>
And thenceforth were renowmd, &amp; sought from place to place.<p>
 
Such is this well, wrought by occasion straunge,<br>
Which to her Nymph befell. Vpon a day,<br>
As she the woods with bow and shafts did raunge,<br>
The hartlesse Hind and Robucke to dismay,<br>
<i>Dan Faunus</i> chaunst to meet her by the way,<br>
And kindling fire at her faire burning eye,<br>
Inflamed was to follow beauties chace,<br>
And chaced her, that fast from him did fly;<br>
As Hind from her, so she fled from her enimy.<p>
 
At last when fayling breath began to faint,<br>
And saw no meanes to scape, of shame affrayd,<br>
She set her downe to weepe for sore constraint,<br>
And to <i>Diana</i> calling lowd for ayde,<br>
Her deare besought, to let her dye a mayd.<br>
The goddesse heard, and suddeine where she sate,<br>
Welling out streames of teares, and quite dismayd<br>
With stony feare of that rude rustick mate,<br>
Transformd her to a stone from stedfast virgins state.<p>
 
Lo now she is that stone, from whose two heads,<br>
As from two weeping eyes, fresh streames do flow,<br>
Yet cold through feare, and old conceiued dreads;<br>
And yet the stone her semblance seemes to show,<br>
Shapt like a maid, that such ye may her know;<br>
And yet her vertues in her water byde:<br>
For it is chast and pure, as purest snow,<br>
Ne lets her waues with any filth be dyde,<br>
But euer like her selfe vnstained hath beene tryde.<p>
 
From thence it comes, that this babes bloudy hand<br>
May not be clensd with water of this well:<br>
Ne certes Sir striue you it to withstand,<br>
But let them still be bloudy, as befell,<br>
That they his mothers innocence may tell,<br>
As she bequeathd in her last testament;<br>
That as a sacred Symbole it may dwell<br>
In her sonnes flesh, to minde reuengement,<br>
And be for all chast Dames an endlesse moniment.<p>
 
He hearkned to his reason, and the childe<br>
Vptaking, to the Palmer gaue to beare;<br>
But his sad fathers armes with bloud defilde,<br>
An heauie load himselfe did lightly reare,<br>
And turning to that place, in which whyleare<br>
He left his loftie steed with golden sell,<br>
And goodly gorgeous barbes, him found not theare.<br>
By other accident that earst befell,<br>
He is conuaide, but how or where, here fits not tell.<p>
 
Which when Sir <i>Guyon</i> saw, all were he wroth,<br>
Yet algates mote he soft himselfe appease,<br>
And fairely fare on foot, how euer loth;<br>
His double burden did him sore disease.<br>
So long they traueiled with litle ease,<br>
Till that at last they to a Castle came,<br>
Built on a rocke adioyning to the seas:<br>
It was an auncient worke of antique fame,<br>
And wondrous strong by nature, and by skilfull frame.<p>
 
Therein three sisters dwelt of sundry sort,<br>
The children of one sire by mothers three;<br>
Who dying whylome did diuide this fort<br>
To them by equall shares in equall fee:<br>
But strifull minde, and diuerse qualitee<br>
Drew them in parts, and each made others foe;<br>
Still did they striue, and dayly disagree;<br>
The eldest did against the youngest goe,<br>
And both against the middest meant to worken woe.<p>
 
Where when the knight arriu'd, he was right well<br>
Receiu'd, as knight of so much worth became,<br>
Of second sister, who did far excell<br>
The other two; <i>Medina</i> was her name,<br>
A sober sad, and comely curteous Dame;<br>
Who rich arayd, and yet in modest guize,<br>
In goodly garments, that her well became,<br>
Faire marching forth in honorable wize,<br>
Him at the threshold met, and well did enterprize.<p>
 
She led him vp into a goodly bowre,<br>
And comely courted with meet modestie,<br>
Ne in her speach, ne in her hauiour,<br>
Was lightnesse seene, or looser vanitie,<br>
But gratious womanhood, and grauitie,<br>
Aboue the reason of her youthly yeares:<br>
Her golden lockes she roundly did vptye<br>
In breaded tramels, that no looser heares<br>
Did out of order stray about her daintie eares.<p>
 
Whilest she her selfe thus busily did frame,<br>
Seemely to entertaine her new-come guest,<br>
Newes hereof to her other sisters came,<br>
Who all this while were at their wanton rest,<br>
Accourting each her friend with lauish fest:<br>
They were two knights of perelesse puissance,<br>
And famous far abroad for warlike gest,<br>
Which to these Ladies loue did countenaunce,<br>
And to his mistresse each himselfe stroue to aduaunce.<p>
 
He that made loue vnto the eldest Dame,<br>
Was hight Sir <i>Huddibras</i>, an hardy man;<br>
Yet not so good of deedes, as great of name,<br>
Which he by many rash aduentures wan,<br>
Since errant armes to sew he first began;<br>
More huge in strength, then wise in workes he was,<br>
And reason with foole-hardize ouer ran;<br>
Sterne melancholy did his courage pas,<br>
And was for terrour more, all armd in shyning bras.<p>
 
But he that lou'd the youngest, was <i>Sans-loy</i>,<br>
He that faire <i>Vna</i> late fowle outraged,<br>
The most vnruly, and the boldest boy,<br>
That euer warlike weapons menaged,<br>
And to all lawlesse lust encouraged,<br>
Through strong opinion of his matchlesse might:<br>
Ne ought he car'd, whom he endamaged<br>
By tortious wrong, or whom bereau'd of right.<br>
He now this Ladies champion chose for loue to fight.<p>
 
These two gay knights, vowd to so diuerse loues,<br>
Each other does enuie with deadly hate,<br>
And dayly warre against his foeman moues,<br>
In hope to win more fauour with his mate,<br>
And th'others pleasing seruice to abate,<br>
To magnifie his owne.  But when they heard,<br>
How in that place straunge knight arriued late,<br>
Both knights and Ladies forth right angry far'd,<br>
And fiercely vnto battell sterne themselues prepar'd.<p>
 
But ere they could proceede vnto the place,<br>
Where he abode, themselues at discord fell,<br>
And cruell combat ioynd in middle space:<br>
With horrible assault, and furie fell,<br>
They heapt huge strokes, the scorned life to quell,<br>
That all on vprore from her settled seat<br>
The house was raysd, and all that in did dwell;<br>
Seemd that lowde thunder with amazement great<br>
Did rend the ratling skyes with flames of fouldring heat.<p>
 
The noyse thereof calth forth that straunger knight,<br>
To weet, what dreadfull thing was there in hand;<br>
Where when as two braue knights in bloudy fight<br>
With deadly rancour he enraunged fond,<br>
His sunbroad shield about his wrest he bond,<br>
And shyning blade vnsheathd, with which he ran<br>
Vnto that stead, their strife to vnderstond;<br>
And at his first arriuall, them began<br>
With goodly meanes to pacifie, well as he can.<p>
 
But they him spying, both with greedy forse<br>
Attonce vpon him ran, and him beset<br>
With strokes of mortall steele without remorse,<br>
And on his shield like yron sledges bet:<br>
As when a Beare and Tygre being met<br>
In cruell fight on lybicke Ocean wide,<br>
Espye a traueiler with feet surbet,<br>
Whom they in equall pray hope to deuide,<br>
They stint their strife, and him assaile on euery side.<p>
 
But he, not like a wearie traueilere,<br>
Their sharpe assault right boldly did rebut,<br>
And suffred not their blowes to byte him nere<br>
But with redoubled buffes them backe did put:<br>
Whose grieued mindes, which choler did englut,<br>
Against themselues turning their wrathfull spight,<br>
Gan with new rage their shields to hew and cut;<br>
But still when <i>Guyon</i> came to part their fight,<br>
With heauie load on him they freshly gan to smight.<p>
 
As a tall ship tossed in troublous seas,<br>
Whom raging windes threatning to make the pray<br>
Of the rough rockes, do diuersly disease,<br>
Meetes two contrary billowes by the way,<br>
That her on either side do sore assay,<br>
And boast to swallow her in greedy graue;<br>
She scorning both their spights, does make wide way,<br>
And with her brest breaking the fomy waue,<br>
Does ride on both their backs, &amp; faire her selfe doth saue.<p>
 
So boldly he him beares, and rusheth forth<br>
Betweene them both, by conduct of his blade.<br>
Wondrous great prowesse and heroick worth<br>
He shewd that day, and rare ensample made,<br>
When two so mighty warriours he dismade:<br>
Attonce he wards and strikes, he takes and payes,<br>
Now forst to yield, now forcing to inuade,<br>
Before, behind, and round about him layes:<br>
So double was his paines, so double be his prayse.<p>
 
Straunge sort of fight, three valiaunt knights to see<br>
Three combats ioyne in one, and to darraine<br>
A triple warre with triple enmitee,<br>
All for their Ladies froward loue to gaine,<br>
Which gotten was but hate. So loue does raine<br>
In stoutest minds, and maketh monstrous warre;<br>
He maketh warre, he maketh peace againe,<br>
And yet his peace is but continuall iarre:<br>
O miserable men, that to him subiect arre.<p>
 
Whilst thus they mingled were in furious armes,<br>
The faire <i>Medina</i> with her tresses torne,<br>
And naked brest, in pitty of their harmes,<br>
Emongst them ran, and falling them beforne,<br>
Besought them by the womb, which them had borne,<br>
And by the loues, which were to them most deare,<br>
And by the knighthood, which they sure had sworne,<br>
Their deadly cruell discord to forbeare,<br>
And to her iust conditions of faire peace to heare.<p>
 
But her two other sisters standing by,<br>
Her lowd gainsaid, and both their champions bad<br>
Pursew the end of their strong enmity,<br>
As euer of their loues they would be glad.<br>
Yet she with pitthy words and counsell sad,<br>
Still stroue their stubborne rages to reuoke,<br>
That at the last suppressing fury mad,<br>
They gan abstaine from dint of direfull stroke,<br>
And hearken to the sober speaches, which she spoke.<p>
 
Ah puissaunt Lords, what cursed euill Spright,<br>
Or fell <i>Erinnys</i>, in your noble harts<br>
Her hellish brond hath kindled with despight,<br>
And stird you vp to worke your wilfull smarts?<br>
Is this the ioy of armes? be these the parts<br>
Of glorious knighthood, after bloud to thrust,<br>
And not regard dew right and iust desarts?<br>
Vaine is the vaunt, and victory vniust,<br>
That more to mighty h&atilde;ds, th&#7869; rightfull cause doth trust.<p>
 
And were there rightfull cause of difference,<br>
Yet were not better, faire it to accord,<br>
Then with bloud guiltinesse to heape offence,<br>
And mortall vengeaunce ioyne to crime abhord?<br>
O fly from wrath, fly, O my liefest Lord:<br>
Sad be the sights, and bitter fruits of warre,<br>
And thousand furies wait on wrathfull sword;<br>
Ne ought the prayse of prowesse more doth marre,<br>
Then fowle reuenging rage, and base contentious iarre.<p>
 
But louely concord, and most sacred peace<br>
Doth nourish vertue, and fast friendship breeds;<br>
Weake she makes str&otilde;g, &amp; str&otilde;g thing does increace,<br>
Till it the pitch of highest prayse exceeds:<br>
Braue be her warres, and honorable deeds,<br>
By which she triumphes ouer ire and pride,<br>
And winnes an Oliue girlond for her meeds:<br>
Be therefore, O my deare Lords, pacifide,<br>
And this misseeming discord meekely lay aside.<p>
 
Her gracious words their rancour did appall,<br>
And suncke so deepe into their boyling brests,<br>
That downe they let their cruell weapons fall,<br>
And lowly did abase their loftie crests<br>
To her faire presence, and discrete behests.<br>
Then she began a treatie to procure,<br>
And stablish termes betwixt both their requests,<br>
That as a law for euer should endure;<br>
Which to obserue in word of knights they did assure.<p>
 
Which to confirme, and fast to bind their league,<br>
After their wearie sweat and bloudy toile,<br>
She them besought, during their quiet treague,<br>
Into her lodging to repaire a while,<br>
To rest themselues, and grace to reconcile.<br>
They soone consent: so forth with her they fare,<br>
Where they are well receiu'd, and made to spoile<br>
Themselues of soiled armes, and to prepare<br>
Their minds to pleasure, &amp; their mouthes to dainty fare.<p>
 
And those two froward sisters, their faire loues<br>
Came with them eke, all were they wondrous loth,<br>
And fained cheare, as for the time behoues,<br>
But could not colour yet so well the troth,<br>
But that their natures bad appeard in both:<br>
For both did at their second sister grutch,<br>
And inly grieue, as doth an hidden moth<br>
The inner garment fret, not th'vtter touch;<br>
One thought their cheare too litle, th'other thought too mutch.<p>
 
<i>Elissa</i> (so the eldest hight) did deeme<br>
Such entertainment base, ne ought would eat,<br>
Ne ought would speake, but euermore did seeme<br>
As discontent for want of merth or meat;<br>
No solace could her Paramour intreat,<br>
Her once to show, ne court, nor dalliance,<br>
But with bent lowring browes, as she would threat,<br>
She scould, and frownd with froward countenaunce,<br>
Vnworthy of faire Ladies comely gouernaunce.<p>
 
But young <i>Perissa</i> was of other mind,<br>
Full of disport, still laughing, loosely light,<br>
And quite contrary to her sisters kind;<br>
No measure in her mood, no rule of right,<br>
But poured out in pleasure and delight;<br>
In wine and meats she flowd aboue the bancke,<br>
And in excesse exceeded her owne might;<br>
In sumptuous tire she ioyd her selfe to prancke,<br>
But of her loue too lauish (litle haue she thancke.)<p>
 
Fast by her side did sit the bold <i>Sans-loy</i><br>
Fit mate for such a mincing mineon,<br>
Who in her loosenesse tooke exceeding ioy;<br>
Might not be found a franker franion,<br>
Of her lewd parts to make companion;<br>
But <i>Huddibras</i>, more like a Malecontent,<br>
Did see and grieue at his bold fashion;<br>
Hardly could he endure his hardiment,<br>
Yet still he sat, and inly did him selfe torment.<p>
 
Betwixt them both the faire <i>Medina</i> sate<br>
With sober grace, and goodly carriage:<br>
With equall measure she did moderate<br>
The strong extremities of their outrage;<br>
That forward paire she euer would asswage,<br>
When they would striue dew reason to exceed;<br>
But that same froward twaine would accourage,<br>
And of her plenty adde vnto their need:<br>
So kept she them in order, and her selfe in heed.<p>
 
Thus fairely she attempered her feast,<br>
And pleasd them all with meete satietie,<br>
At last when lust of meat and drinke was ceast,<br>
She <i>Guyon</i> deare besought of curtesie,<br>
To tell from whence he came through ieopardie,<br>
And whither now on new aduenture bound.<br>
Who with bold grace, and comely grauitie,<br>
Drawing to him the eyes of all around,<br>
From lofty siege began these words aloud to sound.<p>
 
This thy demaund, &ocirc; Lady, doth reuiue<br>
Fresh memory in me of that great Queene,<br>
Great and most glorious virgin Queene aliue,<br>
That with her soueraigne powre, and scepter shene<br>
All Faery lond does peaceable sustene.<br>
In widest Ocean she her throne does reare,<br>
That ouer all the earth it may be seene;<br>
As morning Sunne her beames dispredden cleare,<br>
And in her face faire peace, and mercy doth appeare.<p>
 
In her the richesse of all heauenly grace<br>
In chiefe degree are heaped vp on hye:<br>
And all that else this worlds enclosure bace,<br>
Hath great or glorious in mortall eye.<br>
Adornes the person of her Maiestie;<br>
That men beholding so great excellence,<br>
And rare perfection in mortalitie,<br>
Do her adore with sacred reuerence,<br>
As th'Idole of her makers great magnificence.<p>
 
To her I homage and my seruice owe,<br>
In number of the noblest knights on ground,<br>
Mongst whom on me she deigned to bestowe<br>
Order of <i>Maydenhead</i>, the most renownd,<br>
That may this day in all the world be found:<br>
An yearely solemne feast she wontes to make<br>
The day that first doth lead the yeare around;<br>
To which all knights of worth and courage bold<br>
Resort, to heare of straunge aduentures to be told.<p>
 
There this old Palmer shewed himselfe that day,<br>
And to that mighty Princesse did complaine<br>
Of grieuous mischiefes, which a wicked Fay<br>
Had wrought, and many whelmd in deadly paine,<br>
Whereof he crau'd redresse.  My Soueraine,<br>
Whose glory is in gracious deeds, and ioyes<br>
Throughout the world her mercy to maintaine,<br>
Eftsoones deuisd redresse for such annoyes;<br>
Me all vnfit for so great purpose she employes.<p>
 
Now hath faire <i>Phoebe</i> with her siluer face<br>
Thrise seene the shadowes of the neather world,<br>
Sith last I left that honorable place,<br>
In which her royall presence is introld;<br>
Ne euer shall I rest in house nor hold,<br>
Till I that false <i>Acrasia</i> haue wonne;<br>
Of whose fowle deedes, too hideous to be told<br>
I witnesse am, and this their wretched sonne,<br>
Whose wofull parents she hath wickedly fordonne.<p>
 
Tell on, faire Sir, said she, that dolefull tale,<br>
From which sad ruth does seeme you to restraine,<br>
That we may pitty such vnhappy bale,<br>
And learne from pleasures poyson to abstaine:<br>
Ill by ensample good doth often gayne.<br>
Then forward he his purpose gan pursew,<br>
And told the storie of the mortall payne,<br>
Which <i>Mordant</i> and <i>Amauia</i> did rew;<br>
As with lamenting eyes him selfe did lately vew.<p>
 
Night was far spent, and now in <i>Ocean</i> deepe<br>
<i>Orion</i>, flying fast from hissing snake,<br>
His flaming head did hasten for to steepe,<br>
When of his pitteous tale he end did make;<br>
Whilest with delight of that he wisely spake,<br>
Those guestes beguiled, did beguile their eyes<br>
Of kindly sleepe, that did them ouertake.<br>
At last when they had markt the chaunged skyes,<br>
They wist their houre was sp&#7869;t; th&#7869; each to rest him hyes.<p>
