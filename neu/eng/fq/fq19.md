*Cant. VI.*

> *Guyon is of immodest Merth,  
> led into loose desire,  
> Fights with Cymochles, whiles his bro-  
> ther burnes in furious fire.*

> A harder lesson, to learne Continence  
> In ioyous pleasure, then in grieuous paine:  
> or sweetnesse doth allure the weaker sence  
> So strongly, that vneathes it can refraine  
> From that, which feeble nature couets faine;  
> But griefe and wrath, that be her enemies,  
> And foes of life, she better can restraine;  
> Yet vertue vauntes in both their victories,  
> And *Guyon* in them all shewes goodly maisteries.
>
> Whom bold *Cymochles* trauelling to find,  
> With cruell purpose bent to wreake on him  
> The wrath, which *Atin* kindled in his mind,  
> Came to a riuer, by whose vtmost brim  
> Wayting to passe, he saw whereas did swim  
> A long the shore, as swift as glaunce of eye,  
> A litle Gondelay, bedecked trim  
> With boughes and arbours wouen cunningly,  
> That like a litle forrest seemed outwardly.
>
> And therein sate a Ladie fresh and faire,  
> Making sweet solace to her selfe alone;  
> Sometimes she sung, as loud as larke in aire,  
> Sometimes she laught, that nigh her breth was gone,  
> Yet was there not with her else any one,  
> That might to her moue cause of meriment:  
> Matter of merth enough, though there were none  
> She could deuise, and thousand waies inuent,  
> To feede her foolish humour, and vaine iolliment.
>
> Which when farre off *Cymochles* heard, and saw,  
> He loudly cald to such, as were a bord,  
> The little barke vnto the shore to draw,  
> And him to ferrie ouer that deepe ford:  
> The merry marriner vnto his word  
> Soone hearkned, and her painted bote streightway  
> Turnd to the shore, where that same warlike Lord  
> She in receiu'd; but *Atin* by no way  
> She would admit, albe the knight her much did pray.
>
> Eftsoones her shallow ship away did slide,  
> More swift, then swallow sheres the liquid skie,  
> Withouten oare or Pilot it to guide,  
> Or winged canuas with the wind to flie,  
> Only she turn'd a pin, and by and by  
> It cut away vpon the yielding waue,  
> Ne cared she her course for to apply:  
> For it was taught the way, which she would haue,  
> And both from rocks and flats it selfe could wisely saue.
>
> And all the way, the wanton Damzell found  
> New merth, her passenger to entertaine:  
> For she in pleasant purpose did abound,  
> And greatly ioyed merry tales to faine,  
> Of which a store-house did with her remaine,  
> Yet seemed, nothing well they her became;  
> For all her words she drownd with laughter vaine,  
> And wanted grace in vtt'ring of the same,  
> That turned all her pleasance to a scoffing game.
>
> And other whiles vaine toyes she would deuize  
> As her fantasticke wit did most delight,  
> Sometimes her head she fondly would aguize  
> With gaudie girlonds, or fresh flowrets dight  
> About her necke, or rings of rushes plight;  
> Sometimes to doe him laugh, she would assay  
> To laugh at shaking of the leaues light,  
> Or to behold the water worke, and play  
> About her litle frigot, therein making way.
>
> Her light behauiour, and loose dalliaunce  
> Gaue wondrous great contentment to the knight,  
> That of his way he had no souenaunce,  
> Nor care of vow'd reuenge, and cruell fight,  
> But to weake wench did yeeld his martiall might.  
> So easie was to quench his flamed mind  
> With one sweet drop of sensuall delight:  
> So easie is, t'appease the stormie wind  
> Of malice in the calme of pleasant womankind.
>
> Diuerse discourses in their way they spent,  
> Mongst which *Cymochles* of her questioned,  
> Both what she was, and what that vsage ment,  
> Which in her cot she daily practised.  
> Vaine man (said she) that wouldest be reckoned  
> A straunger in thy home, and ignoraunt  
> Of *Phædria* (for so my name is red)  
> Of *Phædria*, thine owne fellow seruaunt;  
> For thou to serue *Acrasia* thy selfe doest vaunt.
>
> In this wide Inland sea, that hight by name  
> The *Idle lake*, my wandring ship I row,  
> That knowes her port, and thither sailes by ayme,  
> Ne care, ne feare I, how the wind do blow,  
> Or whether swift I wend, or whether slow:  
> Both slow and swift a like do serue my tourne,  
> Ne swelling *Neptune*, ne loud thundring *Ioue*  
> Can chaunge my cheare, or make me euer mourne;  
> My litle boat can safely passe this perilous bourne.
>
> Whiles thus she talked, and whiles thus she toyd,  
> They were farre past the passage, which he spake,  
> And come vnto an Island, waste and voyd,  
> That floted in the midst of that great lake:  
> There her small Gondelay her port did make,  
> And that gay paire issuing on the shore  
> Disburdned her. Their way they forward take  
> Into the land, that lay them faire before,  
> Whose pleasaunce she him shew'd, and plentifull great store.
>
> It was a chosen plot of fertile land,  
> Emongst wide waues set, like a litle nest,  
> As if it had by Natures cunning hand,  
> Bene choisely picked out from all the rest,  
> And laid forth for ensample of the best:  
> No daintie flowre or herbe, that growes on ground,  
> No arboret with painted blossomes drest,  
> And smelling sweet, but there it might be found  
> To bud out faire, and her sweet smels throw all around.
>
> No tree, whose braunches did not brauely spring;  
> No braunch, whereon a fine bird did not sit:  
> No bird, but did her shrill notes sweetly sing;  
> No song but did containe a louely dit:  
> Trees, braunches, birds, and songs were framed fit,  
> For to allure fraile mind to carelesse ease.  
> Carelesse the man soone woxe, and his weake wit  
> Was ouercome of thing, that did him please;  
> So pleased, did his wrathfull purpose faire appease.
>
> Thus when she had his eyes and senses fed  
> With false delights, and fild with pleasures vaine,  
> Into a shadie dale she soft him led,  
> And laid him downe vpon a grassie plaine;  
> And her sweet selfe without dread, or disdaine,  
> She set beside, laying his head disarm'd  
> In her loose lap, it softly to sustaine,  
> Where soone he slumbred, fearing not be harm'd,  
> The whiles with a loue lay she thus him sweetly charm'd.
>
> Behold, ô man, that toilesome paines doest take  
> The flowres, the fields, and all that pleasant growes,  
> How they themselues doe thine ensample make,  
> Whiles nothing enuious nature them forth throwes  
> Out of her fruitfull lap; how, no man knowes,  
> They spring, they bud, they blossome fresh and faire,  
> And deck the world with their rich pompous showes;  
> Yet no man for them taketh paines or care,  
> Yet no man to them can his carefull paines compare.
>
> The lilly, Ladie of the flowring field,  
> The Flowre-deluce, her louely Paramoure,  
> Bid thee to them thy fruitlesse labours yield,  
> And soone leaue off this toylesome wearie stoure;  
> Loe loe how braue she decks her bounteous boure,  
> With silken curtens and gold couerlets,  
> Therein to shrowd her sumptuous Belamoure,  
> Yet neither spinnes nor cardes, ne cares nor frets,  
> But to her mother Nature all her care she lets.
>
> Why then dost thou, ô man, that of them all  
> Art Lord, and eke of nature Soueraine,  
> Wilfully make thy selfe a wretched thrall,  
> And wast thy ioyous houres in needlesse paine,  
> Seeking for daunger and aduentures vaine?  
> What bootes it all to haue, and nothing vse?  
> Who shall him rew, that swimming in the maine,  
> Will die for thirst, and water doth refuse?  
> Refuse such fruitlesse toile, and present pleasures chuse.
>
> By this she had him lulled fast a sleepe,  
> That of no wordly thing he care did take;  
> Then she with liquors strong his eyes did steepe,  
> That nothing should him hastily awake:  
> So she him left, and did her selfe betake  
> Vnto her boat againe, with which she cleft  
> The slouthfull waue of that great griesly lake;  
> Soone she that Island farre behind her left,  
> And now is come to that same place, where first she weft.
>
> By this time was the worthy *Guyon* brought  
> Vnto the other side of that wide strond,  
> Where she was rowing, and for passage sought:  
> Him needed not long call, she soone to hond  
> Her ferry brought, where him she byding fond,  
> With his sad guide; himselfe she tooke a boord,  
> But the *Blacke Palmer* suffred still to stond,  
> Ne would for price, or prayers once affoord,  
> To ferry that old man ouer the perlous foord.
>
> *Guyon* was loath to leaue his guide behind,  
> Yet being entred, might not backe retyre;  
> For the flit barke, obaying to her mind,  
> Forth launched quickly, as she did desire,  
> Ne gaue him leaue to bid that aged sire  
> Adieu, but nimbly ran her wonted course  
> Through the dull billowes thicke as troubled mire,  
> Whom neither wind out of their seat could forse,  
> Nor timely tides did driue out of their sluggish sourse.
>
> And by the way, as was her wonted guize,  
> Her merry fit she freshly gan to reare,  
> And did of ioy and iollitie deuize,  
> Her selfe to cherish, and her guest to cheare:  
> The knight was courteous, and did not forbeare  
> Her honest merth and pleasaunce to partake;  
> But when he saw her toy, and gibe, and geare,  
> And passe the bonds of modest merimake,  
> Her dalliance he despisd, and follies did forsake.
>
> Yet she still followed her former stile,  
> And said, and did all that mote him delight,  
> Till they arriued in that pleasant Ile,  
> Where sleeping late she left her other knight.  
> But when as *Guyon* of that land had sight,  
> He wist himselfe amisse, and angry said;  
> Ah Dame, perdie ye haue not doen me right,  
> Thus to mislead me, whiles I you obaid:  
> Me litle needed from my right way to haue straid.
>
> Faire Sir (quoth she) be not displeasd at all;  
> Who fares on sea, may not commaund his way,  
> Ne wind and weather at his pleasure call:  
> The sea is wide, and easie for to stray;  
> The wind vnstable, and doth neuer stay.  
> But here a while ye may in safety rest,  
> Till season serue new passage to assay;  
> Better safe port, then be in seas distrest.  
> Therewith she laught, and did her earnest end in iest.
>
> But he halfe discontent, mote nathelesse  
> Himselfe appease, and issewd forth on shore:  
> The ioyes whereof, and happie fruitfulnesse,  
> Such as he saw, she gan him lay before,  
> And all though pleasant, yet she made much more:  
> The fields did laugh, the flowres did freshly spring,  
> The trees did bud, and earely blossomes bore,  
> And all the quire of birds did sweetly sing,  
> And told that gardins pleasures in their caroling.
>
> And she more sweet, then any bird on bough,  
> Would oftentimes emongst them beare a part,  
> And striue to passe (as she could well enough)  
> Their natiue musicke by her skilfull art:  
> So did she all, that might his constant hart  
> Withdraw from thought of warlike enterprize,  
> And drowne in dissolute delights apart,  
> Where noyse of armes, or vew of martiall guize  
> Might not reuiue desire of knightly exercize.
>
> But he was wise, and warie of her will,  
> And euer held his hand vpon his hart:  
> Yet would not seeme so rude, and thewed ill,  
> As to despise so courteous seeming part,  
> That gentle Ladie did to him impart,  
> But fairely tempring fond desire subdewd,  
> And euer her desired to depart.  
> She list not heare, but her disports poursewd,  
> And euer bad him stay, till time the tide renewd.
>
> And now by this, *Cymochles* howre was spent,  
> That he awoke out of his idle dreme,  
> And shaking off his drowzie dreriment,  
> Gan him auize, how ill did him beseeme,  
> In slouthfull sleepe his molten hart to steme,  
> And quench the brond of his conceiued ire.  
> Tho vp he started, stird with shame extreme,  
> Ne staied for his Damzell to inquire,  
> But marched to the strond, their passage to require.
>
> And in the way he with Sir *Guyon* met,  
> Accompanyde with *Phædria* the faire,  
> Eftsoones he gan to rage, and inly fret,  
> Crying, Let be that Ladie debonaire,  
> Thou recreant knight, and soone thy selfe prepaire  
> To battell, if thou meane her loue to gaine:  
> Loe, loe alreadie, how the fowles in aire  
> Doe flocke, awaiting shortly to obtaine  
> Thy carcasse for their pray, the guerdon of thy paine.
>
> And therewithall he fiercely at him flew,  
> And with importune outrage him assayld;  
> Who soone prepard to field, his sword forth drew,  
> And him with equall value counteruayld:  
> Their mightie strokes their haberieons dismayld,  
> And naked made each others manly spalles;  
> The mortall steele despiteously entayld  
> Deepe in their flesh, quite through the yron walles,  
> That a large purple streme adown their giambeux falles.
>
> *Cymochles*, that had neuer met before  
> So puissant foe, with enuious despight  
> His proud presumed force increased more,  
> Disdeigning to be held so long in fight;  
> Sir *Guyon* grudging not so much his might,  
> As those vnknightly raylings, which he spoke,  
> With wrathfull fire his courage kindled bright,  
> Thereof deuising shortly to be wroke,  
> And doubling all his powres, redoubled euery stroke.
>
> Both of them high attonce their hands enhaunst,  
> And both attonce their huge blowes downe did sway;  
> *Cymochles* sword on *Guyons* shield yglaunst,  
> And thereof nigh one quarter sheard away;  
> But *Guyons* angry blade so fierce did play  
> On th'others helmet, which as *Titan* shone,  
> That quite it cloue his plumed crest in tway,  
> And bared all his head vnto the bone;  
> Wherewith astonisht, still he stood, as senselesse stone.
>
> Still as he stood, faire *Phædria*, that beheld  
> That deadly daunger, soone atweene them ran;  
> And at their feet her selfe most humbly feld,  
> Crying with pitteous voice, and count'nance wan;  
> Ah well away, most noble Lords, how can  
> Your cruell eyes endure so pitteous sight,  
> To shed your liues on ground? wo worth the man,  
> That first did teach the cursed steele to bight  
> In his owne flesh, and make way to the liuing spright.
>
> If euer loue of Ladie did empierce  
> Your yron brestes, or pittie could find place,  
> Withhold your bloudie hands from battell fierce,  
> And sith for me ye fight, to me this grace  
> Both yeeld, to stay your deadly strife a space.  
> They stayd a while: and forth she gan proceed:  
> Most wretched woman, and of wicked race,  
> That am the author of this hainous deed,  
> And cause of death betweene two doughtie knights doe breed.
>
> But if for me ye fight, or me will serue,  
> Not this rude kind of battell, nor these armes  
> Are meet, the which doe men in bale to sterue,  
> And dolefull sorrow heape with deadly harmes:  
> Such cruell game my scarmoges disarmes:  
> Another warre, and other weapons I  
> Doe loue, where loue does giue his sweet alarmes,  
> Without bloudshed, and where the enemy  
> Does yeeld vnto his foe a pleasant victory.
>
> Debatefull strife, and cruell enmitie  
> The famous name of knighthood fowly shend;  
> But louely peace, and gentle amitie,  
> And in Amours the passing houres to spend,  
> The mightie martiall hands doe most commend;  
> Of loue they euer greater glory bore,  
> Then of their armes: *Mars* is *Cupidoes* frend,  
> And is for *Venus* loues renowmed more,  
> Then all his wars and spoiles, the which he did of yore.
>
> Therewith she sweetly smyld. They though full bent,  
> To proue extremities of bloudie fight,  
> Yet at her speach their rages gan relent,  
> And calme the sea of their tempestuous spight,  
> Such powre haue pleasing words: such is the might  
> Of courteous clemencie in gentle hart.  
> Now after all was ceast, the Faery knight  
> Besought that Damzell suffer him depart,  
> And yield him readie passage to that other part.
>
> She no lesse glad, then he desirous was  
> Of his departure thence; for of her ioy  
> And vaine delight she saw he light did pas,  
> A foe of folly and immodest toy,  
> Still solemne sad, or still disdainfull coy,  
> Delighting all in armes and cruell warre,  
> That her sweet peace and pleasures did annoy,  
> Troubled with terrour and vnquiet iarre,  
> That she well pleased was thence to amoue him farre.
>
> Tho him she brought abord, and her swift bote  
> Forthwith directed to that further strand;  
> The which on the dull waues did lightly flote  
> And soone arriued on the shallow sand,  
> Where gladsome *Guyon* salied forth to land,  
> And to that Damzell thankes gaue for reward.  
> Vpon that shore he spied *Atin* stand,  
> There by his maister left, when late he far'd  
> In *Phædrias* flit barke ouer that perlous shard.
>
> Well could he him remember, sith of late  
> He with *Pyrrochles* sharp debatement made;  
> Streight gan he him reuile, and bitter rate,  
> As shepheards curre, that in darke euenings shade  
> Hath tracted forth some saluage beastes trade;  
> Vile Miscreant (said he) whither doest thou flie  
> The shame and death, which will thee soone inuade?  
> What coward hand shall doe thee next to die,  
> That art thus foully fled from famous enemie?
>
> With that he stiffely shooke his steelehead dart:  
> But sober *Guyon*, hearing him so raile,  
> Though somewhat moued in his mightie hart,  
> Yet with strong reason maistred passion fraile,  
> And passed fairely forth. He turning taile,  
> Backe to the strond retyrd, and there still stayd,  
> Awaiting passage, which him late did faile;  
> The whiles *Cymochles* with that wanton mayd  
> The hastie heat of his auowd reuenge delayd.
>
> Whylest there the varlet stood, he saw from farre  
> An armed knight, that towards him fast ran,  
> He ran on foot, as if in lucklesse warre  
> His forlorne steed from him the victour wan;  
> He seemed breathlesse, hartlesse, faint, and wan,  
> And all his armour sprinckled was with bloud,  
> And soyld with durtie gore, that no man can  
> Discerne the hew thereof. He neuer stood,  
> But bent his hastie course towards the idle flood.
>
> The varlet saw, when to the flood he came,  
> How without stop or stay he fiercely lept,  
> And deepe him selfe beduked in the same,  
> That in the lake his loftie crest was steept,  
> Ne of his safetie seemed care he kept,  
> But with his raging armes he rudely flasht,  
> The waues about, and all his armour swept,  
> That all the bloud and filth away was washt,  
> Yet still he bet the water, and the billowes dasht.
>
> *Atin* drew nigh, to weet what it mote bee;  
> For much he wondred at that vncouth sight;  
> Whom should he, but his owne deare Lord, there see,  
> His owne deare Lord *Pyrrochles*, in sad plight,  
> Readie to drowne himselfe for fell despight.  
> Harrow now out, and well away, he cryde,  
> What dismall day hath lent this cursed light,  
> To see my Lord so deadly damnifyde  
> *Pyrrochles*, ô *Pyrrochles*, what is thee betyde?
>
> I burne, I burne, I burne, then loud he cryde,  
> O how I burne with implacable fire,  
> Yet nought can quench mine inly flaming syde,  
> Nor sea of licour cold, nor lake of mire,  
> Nothing but death can doe me to respire.  
> Ah be it (said he) from *Pyrrochles* farre  
> After pursewing death once to require,  
> Or think, that ought those puissant hands may marre:  
> Death is for wretches borne vnder vnhappie starre.
>
> Perdie, then is it fit for me (said he)  
> That am, I weene, most wretched man aliue,  
> Burning in flames, yet no flames can I see,  
> And dying daily, daily yet reuiue:  
> O *Atin*, helpe to me last death to giue.  
> The varlet at his plaint was grieu'd so sore,  
> That his deepe wounded hart in two did riue,  
> And his owne health remembring now no more,  
> Did follow that ensample, which he blam'd afore.
>
> Into the lake he lept, his Lord to ayd,  
> (So Loue the dread of daunger doth despise)  
> And of him catching hold him strongly stayd  
> From drowning. But more happie he, then wise  
> Of that seas nature did him not auise.  
> The waues thereof so slow and sluggish were,  
> Engrost with mud, which did them foule agrise,  
> That euery weightie thing they did vpbeare,  
> Ne ought mote euer sinke downe to the bottome there.
>
> Whiles thus they strugled in that idle waue,  
> And stroue in vaine, the one himselfe to drowne,  
> The other both from drowning for to saue,  
> Lo, to that shore one in an auncient gowne,  
> Whose hoarie locks great grauitie did crowne,  
> Holding in hand a goodly arming sword,  
> By fortune came, led with the troublous sowne:  
> Where drenched deepe he found in that dull ford  
> The carefull seruant, striuing with his raging Lord.
>
> Him *Atin* spying, knew right well of yore,  
> And loudly cald, Helpe helpe, ô *Archimage*;  
> To saue my Lord, in wretched plight forlore;  
> Helpe with thy hand, or with thy counsell sage:  
> Weake hands, but counsell is most strong in age.  
> Him when the old man saw, he wondred sore,  
> To see *Pyrrochles* there so rudely rage:  
> Yet sithens helpe, he saw, he needed more  
> Then pittie, he in hast approched to the shore.
>
> And cald, *Pyrrochles*, what is this, I see?  
> What hellish furie hath at earst thee hent?  
> Furious euer I thee knew to bee,  
> Yet neuer in this straunge astonishment.  
> These flames, these flames (he cryde) do me torment.  
> What flames (quoth he) when I thee present see,  
> In daunger rather to be drent, then brent?  
> Harrow, the flames, which me consume (said hee)  
> Ne can be quencht, within my secret bowels bee.
>
> That cursed man, that cruell feend of hell,  
> *Furor*, oh *Furor* hath me thus bedight:  
> His deadly wounds within my liuers swell,  
> And his whot fire burnes in mine entrails bright,  
> Kindled through his infernall brond of spight,  
> Sith late with him I batteil vaine would boste;  
> That now I weene *Ioues* dreaded thunder light  
> Does scorch not halfe so sore, nor damned ghoste  
> In flaming *Phlegeton* does not so felly roste.
>
> Which when as *Archimago* heard, his griefe  
> He knew right well, and him attonce disarmd:  
> Then searcht his secret wounds, and made a priefe  
> Of euery place, that was with brusing harmd,  
> Or with the hidden fire too inly warmd.  
> Which done, he balmes and herbes thereto applyde,  
> And eue\[r\]more with mighty spels them charmd,  
> That in short space he has them qualifyde,  
> And him restor'd to health, that would haue algates dyde.
