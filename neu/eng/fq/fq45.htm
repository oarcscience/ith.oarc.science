<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>Both Scudamour and Arthegall<br>
Doe fight with Britomart:<br>
He sees her face; doth fall in loue,<br>
and soone from her depart.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
VV
Hat equall torment to the griefe of mind,<br>
And pyning anguish hid in gentle hart,<br>
That inly feeds it selfe with thoughts vnkind,<br>
And nourisheth her owne consuming smart?<br>
What medicine can any Leaches art<br>
Yeeld such a sore, that doth her grieuance hide,<br>
And will to none her maladie impart?<br>
Such was the wound that <i>Scudamour</i> did gride;<br>
For which <i>Dan Phebus</i> selfe cannot a salue prouide.<p> 

Who hauing left that restlesse house of <i>Care</i>,<br>
The next day, as he on his way did ride,<br>
Full of melancholie and sad misfare,<br>
Through misconceipt; all vnawares espide<br>
An armed Knight vnder a forrest side,<br>
Sitting in shade beside his grazing steede;<br>
Who soone as them approaching he descride,<br>
Gan towards them to pricke with eger speede,<br>
That seem'd he was full bent to some mischieuous deede.<p>

Which <i>Scudamour</i> perceiuing, forth issewed<br>
To haue rencountred him in equall race;<br>
But soone as th'other nigh approaching, vewed<br>
The armes he bore, his speare he gan abase,<br>
And voide his course: at which so suddain case<br>
He wondred much. But th'other thus can say;<br>
Ah gentle <i>Scudamour</i>, vnto your grace<br>
I me submit, and you of pardon pray,<br>
That almost had against you trespassed this day.<p>

Whereto thus <i>Scudamour</i>, Small harme it were<br>
For any knight, vpon a ventrous knight<br>
Without displeasance for to proue his spere.<br>
But reade you Sir, sith ye my name haue hight,<br>
What is your owne, that I mote you requite?<br>
Certes (sayd he) ye mote as now excuse<br>
Me from discouering you my name aright:<br>
For time yet serues that I the same refuse,<br>
But call ye me the <i>Saluage Knight</i>, as others vse.<p>

Then this, Sir <i>Saluage Knight</i> (quoth he) areede;<br>
Or doe you here within this forrest wonne,<br>
That seemeth well to answere to your weede?<br>
Or haue ye it for some occasion donne?<br>
That rather seemes, sith knowen armes ye shonne.<br>
This other day (sayd he) a stranger knight<br>
Shame and dishonour hath vnto me donne;<br>
On whom I waite to wreake that foule despight,<br>
When euer he this way shall passe by day or night.<p>

Shame be his meede (quoth he) that meaneth shame.<br>
But what is he, by whom ye shamed were?<br>
A stranger knight, sayd he, vnknowne by name,<br>
But knowne by fame, and by an Hebene speare,<br>
With which he all that met him, downe did beare.<br>
He in an open Turney lately held,<br>
Fro me the honour of that game did reare;<br>
And hauing me all wearie earst, downe feld,<br>
The fayrest Ladie reft, and euer since withheld.<p>

When <i>Scudamour</i> heard mention of that speare,<br>
He wist right well, that it was <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
The which from him his fairest loue did beare.<br>
Tho gan he swell in euery inner part,<br>
For fell despight, and gnaw his gealous hart,<br>
That thus he sharply sayd; Now by my head,<br>
Yet is not this the first vnknightly part,<br>
Which that same knight, whom by his launce I read,<br>
Hath doen to noble knights, that many makes him dread.<p>

For lately he my loue hath fro me reft,<br>
And eke defiled with foule villanie<br>
The sacred pledge, which in his faith was left,<br>
In shame of knighthood and fidelitie;<br>
The which ere long full deare he shall abie.<br>
And if to that auenge by you decreed<br>
This hand may helpe, or succour ought supplie,<br>
It shall not fayle, when so ye shall it need.<br>
So both to wreake their wrathes on <i>Britomart</i> agreed.<p>

Whiles thus they communed, lo farre away<br>
A Knight soft ryding towards them they spyde,<br>
Attyr'd in forraine armes and straunge aray:<br>
Wh&otilde; when they nigh approcht, they plaine descryde<br>
To be the same, for whom they did abyde.<br>
Sayd then Sir <i>Scudamour</i>, Sir <i>Saluage</i> knight<br>
Let me this craue, sith first I was defyde,<br>
That first I may that wrong to him requite:<br>
And if I hap to fayle, you shall recure my right.<p>

Which being yeelded, he his threatfull speare<br>
Gan fewter, and against her fiercely ran.<br>
Who soone as she him saw approaching neare<br>
With so fell rage, her selfe she lightly gan<br>
To dight, to welcome him, well as she can:<br>
But entertaind him in so rude a wise,<br>
That to the ground she smote both horse and man;<br>
Whence neither greatly hasted to arise,<br>
But on their common harmes together did deuise.<p>

But <i>Artegall</i> beholding his mischaunce,<br>
New matter added to his former fire;<br>
And eft auentring his steeleheaded launce,<br>
Against her rode, full of despiteous ire,<br>
That nought but spoyle and vengeance did require.<br>
But to himselfe his felonous intent<br>
Returning, disappointed his desire,<br>
Whiles vnawares his saddle he forwent,<br>
And found himselfe on ground in great amazement.<p>

Lightly he started vp out of that stound,<br>
And snatching forth his direfull deadly blade,<br>
Did leape to her, as doth an eger hound<br>
Thrust to an Hynd within some couert glade,<br>
Whom without perill he cannot inuade.<br>
With such fell greedines he her assayled,<br>
That though she mounted were, yet he her made<br>
To giue him ground, (so much his force preuayled)<br>
And shun his mightie strokes, gainst which no armes auayled.<p>

So as they coursed here and there, it chaunst<br>
That in her wheeling round, behind her crest<br>
So sorely he her strooke, that thence it glaunst<br>
Adowne her backe, the which it fairely blest<br>
From foule mischance; ne did it euer rest,<br>
Till on her horses hinder parts it fell;<br>
Where byting deepe, so deadly it imprest,<br>
That quite it chynd his backe behind the sell,<br>
And to alight on foote her algates did compell.<p>

Like as the lightning brond from riuen skie,<br>
Throwne out by angry <i>Ioue</i> in his vengeance,<br>
With dreadfull force falles on some steeple hie;<br>
Which battring, downe it on the church doth glance,<br>
And teares it all with terrible mischance.<br>
Yet she no whit dismayd, her steed forsooke,<br>
And casting from her that enchaunted lance,<br>
Vnto her sword and shield her soone betooke;<br>
And therewithall at him right furiously she strooke.<p>

So furiously she strooke in her first heat,<br>
Whiles with long fight on foot he breathlesse was,<br>
That she him forced backward to retreat,<br>
And yeeld vnto her weapon way to pas:<br>
Whose raging rigour neither steele nor bras<br>
Could stay, but to the tender flesh it went,<br>
And pour'd the purple bloud forth on the gras;<br>
That all his mayle yriv'd, and plates yrent,<br>
Shew'd all his bodie bare vnto the cruell dent.<p>

At length when as he saw her hastie heat<br>
Abate, and panting breath begin to fayle,<br>
He through long sufferance growing now more great,<br>
Rose in his strength, and gan her fresh assayle,<br>
Heaping huge strokes, as thicke as showre of hayle,<br>
And lashing dreadfully at euery part,<br>
As if he thought her soule to disentrayle.<br>
Ah cruell hand, and thrise more cruell hart,<br>
That workst such wrecke on her, to whom thou dearest art.<p>

What yron courage euer could endure,<br>
To worke such outrage on so faire a creature?<br>
And in his madnesse thinke with hands impure<br>
To spoyle so goodly workmanship of nature,<br>
The maker selfe resembling in her feature?<br>
Certes some hellish furie, or some feend<br>
This mischiefe framd, for their first loues defeature,<br>
To bath their hands in bloud of dearest freend,<br>
Thereby to make their loues beginning, their liues end.<p>

Thus long they trac'd, and trauerst to and fro,<br>
Sometimes pursewing, and sometimes pursewed,<br>
Still as aduantage they espyde thereto:<br>
But toward th'end Sir <i>Arthegall</i> renewed<br>
His strength still more, but she still more decrewed.<br>
At last his lucklesse hand he heau'd on hie,<br>
Hauing his forces all in one accrewed,<br>
And therewith stroke at her so hideouslie,<br>
That seemed nought but death mote be her destinie.<p>

The wicked stroke vpon her helmet chaunst,<br>
And with the force, which in it selfe it bore,<br>
Her ventayle shard away, and thence forth glaunst<br>
A downe in vaine, ne harm'd her any more.<br>
With that her angels face, vnseene afore,<br>
Like to the ruddie morne appeard in sight,<br>
Deawed with siluer drops, through sweating sore;<br>
But somewhat redder, then beseem'd aright,<br>
Through toylesome heate and labour of her weary fight.<p>

And round about the same, her yellow heare<br>
Hauing through stirring loosd their wonted band,<br>
Like to a golden border did appeare,<br>
Framed in goldsmithes forge with cunning hand:<br>
Yet goldsmithes cunning could not vnderstand<br>
To frame such subtile wire, so shinie cleare.<br>
For it did glister like the golden sand,<br>
The which <i>Pactolus</i> with his waters shere,<br>
Throwes forth vpon the riuage round about him nere.<p>

And as his hand he vp againe did reare,<br>
Thinking to worke on her his vtmost wracke,<br>
His powrelesse arme benumbd with secret feare<br>
From his reuengefull purpose shronke abacke,<br>
And cruell sword out of his fingers slacke<br>
Fell downe to ground, as if the steele had sence,<br>
And felt some ruth, or sence his hand did lacke,<br>
Or both of them did thinke, obedience<br>
To doe to so diuine a beauties excellence.<p>

And he himselfe long gazing thereupon,<br>
At last fell humbly downe vpon his knee,<br>
And of his wonder made religion,<br>
Weening some heauenly goddesse he did see,<br>
Or else vnweeting, what it else might bee;<br>
And pardon her besought his errour frayle,<br>
That had done outrage in so high degree:<br>
Whilest trembling horrour did his sense assayle,<br>
And made ech member quake, and manly hart to quayle.<p>

Nathelesse she full of wrath for that late stroke,<br>
All that long while vpheld her wrathfull hand,<br>
With fell intent, on him to bene ywroke,<br>
And looking sterne, still ouer him did stand,<br>
Threatning to strike, vnlesse he would withstand:<br>
And bad him rise, or surely he should die.<br>
But die or liue for nought he would vpstand<br>
But her of pardon prayd more earnestlie,<br>
Or wreake on him her will for so great iniurie.<p>

Which when as <i>Scudamour</i>, who now abrayd,<br>
Beheld, whereas he stood not farre aside,<br>
He was therewith right wondrously dismayd,<br>
And drawing nigh, when as he plaine descride<br>
That peerelesse paterne of Dame natures pride,<br>
And heauenly image of perfection,<br>
He blest himselfe, as one sore terrifide,<br>
And turning his feare to faint deuotion,<br>
Did worship her as some celestiall vision.<p>

But <i>Glauce</i>, seeing all that chaunced there,<br>
Well weeting how their errour to assoyle,<br>
Full glad of so good end, to them drew nere,<br>
And her salewd with seemely belaccoyle,<br>
Ioyous to see her safe after long toyle.<br>
Then her besought, as she to her was deare,<br>
To graunt vnto those warriours truce a whyle;<br>
Which yeelded, they their beuers vp did reare,<br>
And shew'd themselues to her, such as indeed they were.<p>

When <i>Britomart</i> with sharpe auizefull eye<br>
Beheld the louely face of <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
Tempred with sternesse and stout maiestie,<br>
She gan eftsoones it to her mind to call,<br>
To be the same which in her fathers hall<br>
Long since in that enchaunted glasse she saw.<br>
Therewith her wrathfull courage gan appall,<br>
And haughtie spirits meekely to adaw,<br>
That her enhaunced hand she downe can soft withdraw.<p>

Yet she it forst to haue againe vpheld,<br>
As fayning choler, which was turn'd to cold:<br>
But euer when his visage she beheld,<br>
Her hand fell downe, and would no longer hold<br>
The wrathfull weapon gainst his countnance bold:<br>
But when in vaine to fight she oft assayd,<br>
She arm'd her tongue, and thought at him to scold;<br>
Nathlesse her tongue not to her will obayd,<br>
But brought forth speeches myld, when she would haue missayd.<p>

But <i>Scudamour</i> now woxen inly glad,<br>
That all his gealous feare he false had found,<br>
And how that Hag his loue abused had<br>
With breach of faith and loyaltie vnsound,<br>
The which long time his grieued hart did wound,<br>
He thus bespake; Certes Sir <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
I ioy to see you lout so low on ground,<br>
And now become to liue a Ladies thrall,<br>
That whylome in your minde wont to despise them all.<p>

Soone as she heard the name of <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
Her hart did leape, and all her hart-strings tremble,<br>
For sudden ioy, and secret feare withall,<br>
And all her vitall powres with motion nimble,<br>
To succour it, themselues gan there assemble,<br>
That by the swift recourse of flushing blood<br>
Right plaine appeard, though she it would dissemble,<br>
And fayned still her former angry mood,<br>
Thinking to hide the depth by troubling of the flood.<p>

When <i>Glauce</i> thus gan wisely all vpknit;<br>
Ye gentle Knights, whom fortune here hath brought,<br>
To be spectators of this vncouth fit,<br>
Which secret fate hath in this Ladie wrought,<br>
Against the course of kind, ne meruaile nought,<br>
Ne thenceforth feare the thing that hethertoo<br>
Hath troubled both your mindes with idle thought,<br>
Fearing least she your loues away should woo,<br>
Feared in vaine, sith meanes ye see there wants theretoo.<p>

And you Sir <i>Artegall</i>, the saluage knight,<br>
Henceforth may not disdaine, that womans hand<br>
Hath conquered you anew in second fight:<br>
For whylome they haue conquerd sea and land,<br>
And heauen it selfe, that nought may them withstand,<br>
Ne henceforth be rebellious vnto loue,<br>
That is the crowne of knighthood, and the band<br>
Of noble minds deriued from aboue,<br>
Which being knit with vertue, neuer will remoue.<p>

And you faire Ladie knight, my dearest Dame,<br>
Relent the rigour of your wrathfull will,<br>
Whose fire were better turn'd to other flame;<br>
And wiping out remembrance of all ill,<br>
Graunt him your grace, but so that he fulfill<br>
The penance, which ye shall to him empart:<br>
For louers heauen must passe by sorrowes hell.<br>
Thereat full inly blushed <i>Britomart</i>;<br>
But <i>Artegall</i> close smyling ioy'd in secret hart.<p>

Yet durst he not make loue so suddenly,<br>
Ne thinke th'affection of her hart to draw<br>
From one to other so quite contrary:<br>
Besides her modest countenance he saw<br>
So goodly graue, and full of princely aw,<br>
That it his ranging fancie did refraine,<br>
And looser thoughts to lawfull bounds withdraw;<br>
Whereby the passion grew more fierce and faine,<br>
Like to a stubborne steede whom strong hand would restraine.<p>

But <i>Scudamour</i> whose hart twixt doubtfull feare<br>
And feeble hope hung all this while suspence,<br>
Desiring of his <i>Amoret</i> to heare<br>
Some gladfull newes and sure intelligence,<br>
Her thus bespake; But Sir without offence<br>
Mote I request you tydings of my loue,<br>
My <i>Amoret</i>, sith you her freed fro thence,<br>
Where she captiued long, great woes did proue;<br>
That where ye left, I may her seeke, as doth behoue.<p>

To whom thus <i>Britomart</i>, Certes Sir knight,<br>
What is of her become, or whether reft,<br>
I can not vnto you aread a right.<br>
For from that time I from enchaunters theft<br>
Her freed, in which ye her all hopelesse left,<br>
I her preseru'd from perill and from feare,<br>
And euermore from villenie her kept:<br>
Ne euer was there wight to me more deare<br>
Then she, ne vnto whom I more true loue did beare.<p>

Till on a day as through a desert wyld<br>
We trauelled, both wearie of the way<br>
We did alight, and sate in shadow myld;<br>
Where fearelesse I to sleepe me downe did lay.<br>
But when as I did out of sleepe abray,<br>
I found her not, where I her left whyleare,<br>
But thought she wandred was, or gone astray.<br>
I cal'd her loud, I sought her farre and neare;<br>
But no where could her find, nor tydings of her heare.<p>

When <i>Scudamour</i> those heauie tydings heard,<br>
His hart was thrild with point of deadly feare;<br>
Ne in his face or bloud or life appeard,<br>
But senselesse stood, like to a mazed steare,<br>
That yet of mortall stroke the stound doth beare.<br>
Till <i>Glauce</i> thus; Faire Sir, be nought dismayd<br>
With needelesse dread, till certaintie ye heare:<br>
For yet she may be safe though somewhat strayd;<br>
Its best to hope the best, though of the worst affrayd.<p>

Nathlesse he hardly of her chearefull speech<br>
Did comfort take, or in his troubled sight<br>
Shew'd change of better cheare: so sore a breach<br>
That sudden newes had made into his spright;<br>
Till <i>Britomart</i> him fairely thus behight;<br>
Great cause of sorrow certes Sir ye haue:<br>
But comfort take: for by this heauens light<br>
I vow, you dead or liuing not to leaue,<br>
Till I her find, and wreake on him that her did reaue.<p>

Therewith he rested, and well pleased was.<br>
So peace being confirm'd amongst them all,<br>
They tooke their steeds, and forward thence did pas<br>
Vnto some resting place, which mote befall,<br>
All being guided by Sir <i>Artegall</i>.<br>
Where goodly solace was vnto them made,<br>
And dayly feasting both in bowre and hall,<br>
Vntill that they their wounds well healed had,<br>
And wearie limmes recur'd after late vsage bad.<p>

In all which time, Sir <i>Artegall</i> made way<br>
Vnto the loue of noble <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
And with meeke seruice and much suit did lay<br>
Continuall siege vnto her gentle hart;<br>
Which being whylome launcht with louely dart,<br>
More eath was new impression to receiue,<br>
How euer she her paynd with womanish art<br>
To hide her wound, that none might it perceiue:<br>
Vaine is the art that seekes it selfe for to deceiue.<p>

So well he woo'd her, and so well he wrought her,<br>
With faire entreatie and sweet blandishment,<br>
That at the length vnto a bay he brought her,<br>
So as she to his speeches was content<br>
To lend an eare, and softly to relent.<br>
At last through many vowes which forth he pour'd,<br>
And many othes, she yeelded her consent<br>
To be his loue, and take him for her Lord,<br>
Till they with mariage meet might finish that accord.<p>

Tho when they had long time there taken rest,<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i>, who all this while was bound<br>
Vpon an hard aduenture yet in quest,<br>
Fit time for him thence to depart it found,<br>
To follow that, which he did long propound;<br>
And vnto her his congee came to take.<br>
But her therewith full sore displeasd he found,<br>
And loth to leaue her late betrothed make,<br>
Her dearest loue full loth so shortly to forsake.<p>

Yet he with strong perswasions her asswaged,<br>
And wonne her will to suffer him depart;<br>
For which his faith with her he fast engaged,<br>
And thousand vowes from bottome of his hart<br>
That all so soone as he by wit or art<br>
Could that atchieue, whereto he did aspire,<br>
He vnto her would speedily reuert:<br>
No longer space thereto he did desire,<br>
But till the horned moone three courses did expire.<p>

With which she for the present was appeased,<br>
And yeelded leaue, how euer malcontent<br>
She inly were, and in her mind displeased.<br>
So early in the morrow next he went<br>
Forth on his way, to which he was ybent.<br>
Ne wight him to attend, or way to guide,<br>
As whylome was the custome ancient<br>
Mongst Knights, when on aduentures they did ride,<br>
Saue that she algates him a while accompanide.<p>

And by the way she sundry purpose found<br>
Of this or that, the time for to delay,<br>
And of the perils whereto he was bound,<br>
The feare whereof seem'd much her to affray:<br>
But all she did was but to weare out day.<br>
Full oftentimes she leaue of him did take;<br>
And eft againe deuiz'd some what to say,<br>
Which she forgot, whereby excuse to make:<br>
So loth she was his companie for to forsake.<p>

At last when all her speeches she had spent,<br>
And new occasion fayld her more to find,<br>
She left him to his fortunes gouernment,<br>
And backe returned with right heauie mind,<br>
To <i>Scudamour</i>, who she had left behind:<br>
With whom she went to seeke faire <i>Amoret</i>,<br>
Her second care, though in another kind;<br>
For vertues onely sake, which doth beget<br>
True loue and faithfull friendship, she by her did set.<p>

Backe to that desert forrest they retyred,<br>
Where sorie <i>Britomart</i> had lost her late;<br>
There they her sought, and euery where inquired,<br>
Where they might tydings get of her estate;<br>
Yet found they none.  But by what haplesse fate,<br>
Or hard misfortune she was thence conuayd,<br>
And stolne away from her beloued mate,<br>
Were long to tell; therefore I here will stay<br>
Vntill another tyde, that I it finish may.<p>
