*Cant. II.*

> *Babes bloudie hands may not be clensd,  
> the face of golden Meane.  
> Her sisters two Extremities:  
> striue her to banish cleane.*

> T Hus when Sir *Guyon* with his faithfull guide  
> Had with due rites and dolorous lament  
> The end of their sad Tragedie vptyde,  
> The little babe vp in his armes he hent;  
> Who with sweet pleasance and bold blandishment  
> Gan smyle on them, that rather ought to weepe,  
> As carelesse of his woe, or innocent  
> Of that was doen, that ruth emperced deepe  
> In that knights heart, and wordes with bitter teares did steepe.
>
> Ah lucklesse babe, borne vnder cruell starre,  
> And in dead parents balefull ashes bred,  
> Full litle weenest thou, what sorrowes are  
> Left thee for portion of thy liuelihed,  
> Poore Orphane in the wide world scattered,  
> As budding braunch rent from the natiue tree,  
> And throwen forth, till it be withered:  
> Such is the state of men: thus enter wee  
> Into this life with woe, and end with miseree.
>
> Then soft himselfe inclyning on his knee  
> Downe to that well, did in the water weene  
> (So loue does loath disdainfull nicitee)  
> His guiltie hands from bloudie gore to cleene,  
> He washt them oft and oft, yet nought they beene  
> For all his washing cleaner. Still he stroue,  
> Yet still the litle hands were bloudie seene;  
> The which him into great amaz'ment droue,  
> And into diuerse doubt his wauering wonder cloue.
>
> He wist not whether blot of foule offence  
> Might not be purgd with water nor with bath;  
> Or that high God, in lieu of innocence,  
> Imprinted had that token of his wrath,  
> To shew how sore bloudguiltinesse he hat'th;  
> Or that the charme and venim, which they druncke,  
> Their bloud with secret filth infected hath,  
> Being diffused through the senselesse truncke,  
> That through the great contagion direfull deadly stunck.
>
> Whom thus at gaze, the Palmer gan to bord  
> With goodly reason, and thus faire bespake;  
> Ye bene right hard amated, gratious Lord,  
> And of your ignorance great maruell make,  
> Whiles cause not well conceiued ye mistake.  
> But know, that secret vertues are infusd  
> In euery fountaine, and in euery lake,  
> Which who hath skill them rightly to haue chusd,  
> To proofe of passing wonders hath full often vsd.
>
> Of those some were so from their sourse indewd  
> By great Dame Nature, from whose fruitfull pap  
> Their welheads spring, and are with moisture dewd;  
> Which feedes each liuing plant with liquid sap,  
> And filles with flowres faire *Floraes* painted lap:  
> But other some by gift of later grace,  
> Or by good prayers, or by other hap,  
> Had vertue pourd into their waters bace,  
> And thenceforth were renowmd, & sought from place to place.
>
> Such is this well, wrought by occasion straunge,  
> Which to her Nymph befell. Vpon a day,  
> As she the woods with bow and shafts did raunge,  
> The hartlesse Hind and Robucke to dismay,  
> *Dan Faunus* chaunst to meet her by the way,  
> And kindling fire at her faire burning eye,  
> Inflamed was to follow beauties chace,  
> And chaced her, that fast from him did fly;  
> As Hind from her, so she fled from her enimy.
>
> At last when fayling breath began to faint,  
> And saw no meanes to scape, of shame affrayd,  
> She set her downe to weepe for sore constraint,  
> And to *Diana* calling lowd for ayde,  
> Her deare besought, to let her dye a mayd.  
> The goddesse heard, and suddeine where she sate,  
> Welling out streames of teares, and quite dismayd  
> With stony feare of that rude rustick mate,  
> Transformd her to a stone from stedfast virgins state.
>
> Lo now she is that stone, from whose two heads,  
> As from two weeping eyes, fresh streames do flow,  
> Yet cold through feare, and old conceiued dreads;  
> And yet the stone her semblance seemes to show,  
> Shapt like a maid, that such ye may her know;  
> And yet her vertues in her water byde:  
> For it is chast and pure, as purest snow,  
> Ne lets her waues with any filth be dyde,  
> But euer like her selfe vnstained hath beene tryde.
>
> From thence it comes, that this babes bloudy hand  
> May not be clensd with water of this well:  
> Ne certes Sir striue you it to withstand,  
> But let them still be bloudy, as befell,  
> That they his mothers innocence may tell,  
> As she bequeathd in her last testament;  
> That as a sacred Symbole it may dwell  
> In her sonnes flesh, to minde reuengement,  
> And be for all chast Dames an endlesse moniment.
>
> He hearkned to his reason, and the childe  
> Vptaking, to the Palmer gaue to beare;  
> But his sad fathers armes with bloud defilde,  
> An heauie load himselfe did lightly reare,  
> And turning to that place, in which whyleare  
> He left his loftie steed with golden sell,  
> And goodly gorgeous barbes, him found not theare.  
> By other accident that earst befell,  
> He is conuaide, but how or where, here fits not tell.
>
> Which when Sir *Guyon* saw, all were he wroth,  
> Yet algates mote he soft himselfe appease,  
> And fairely fare on foot, how euer loth;  
> His double burden did him sore disease.  
> So long they traueiled with litle ease,  
> Till that at last they to a Castle came,  
> Built on a rocke adioyning to the seas:  
> It was an auncient worke of antique fame,  
> And wondrous strong by nature, and by skilfull frame.
>
> Therein three sisters dwelt of sundry sort,  
> The children of one sire by mothers three;  
> Who dying whylome did diuide this fort  
> To them by equall shares in equall fee:  
> But strifull minde, and diuerse qualitee  
> Drew them in parts, and each made others foe;  
> Still did they striue, and dayly disagree;  
> The eldest did against the youngest goe,  
> And both against the middest meant to worken woe.
>
> Where when the knight arriu'd, he was right well  
> Receiu'd, as knight of so much worth became,  
> Of second sister, who did far excell  
> The other two; *Medina* was her name,  
> A sober sad, and comely curteous Dame;  
> Who rich arayd, and yet in modest guize,  
> In goodly garments, that her well became,  
> Faire marching forth in honorable wize,  
> Him at the threshold met, and well did enterprize.
>
> She led him vp into a goodly bowre,  
> And comely courted with meet modestie,  
> Ne in her speach, ne in her hauiour,  
> Was lightnesse seene, or looser vanitie,  
> But gratious womanhood, and grauitie,  
> Aboue the reason of her youthly yeares:  
> Her golden lockes she roundly did vptye  
> In breaded tramels, that no looser heares  
> Did out of order stray about her daintie eares.
>
> Whilest she her selfe thus busily did frame,  
> Seemely to entertaine her new-come guest,  
> Newes hereof to her other sisters came,  
> Who all this while were at their wanton rest,  
> Accourting each her friend with lauish fest:  
> They were two knights of perelesse puissance,  
> And famous far abroad for warlike gest,  
> Which to these Ladies loue did countenaunce,  
> And to his mistresse each himselfe stroue to aduaunce.
>
> He that made loue vnto the eldest Dame,  
> Was hight Sir *Huddibras*, an hardy man;  
> Yet not so good of deedes, as great of name,  
> Which he by many rash aduentures wan,  
> Since errant armes to sew he first began;  
> More huge in strength, then wise in workes he was,  
> And reason with foole-hardize ouer ran;  
> Sterne melancholy did his courage pas,  
> And was for terrour more, all armd in shyning bras.
>
> But he that lou'd the youngest, was *Sans-loy*,  
> He that faire *Vna* late fowle outraged,  
> The most vnruly, and the boldest boy,  
> That euer warlike weapons menaged,  
> And to all lawlesse lust encouraged,  
> Through strong opinion of his matchlesse might:  
> Ne ought he car'd, whom he endamaged  
> By tortious wrong, or whom bereau'd of right.  
> He now this Ladies champion chose for loue to fight.
>
> These two gay knights, vowd to so diuerse loues,  
> Each other does enuie with deadly hate,  
> And dayly warre against his foeman moues,  
> In hope to win more fauour with his mate,  
> And th'others pleasing seruice to abate,  
> To magnifie his owne. But when they heard,  
> How in that place straunge knight arriued late,  
> Both knights and Ladies forth right angry far'd,  
> And fiercely vnto battell sterne themselues prepar'd.
>
> But ere they could proceede vnto the place,  
> Where he abode, themselues at discord fell,  
> And cruell combat ioynd in middle space:  
> With horrible assault, and furie fell,  
> They heapt huge strokes, the scorned life to quell,  
> That all on vprore from her settled seat  
> The house was raysd, and all that in did dwell;  
> Seemd that lowde thunder with amazement great  
> Did rend the ratling skyes with flames of fouldring heat.
>
> The noyse thereof calth forth that straunger knight,  
> To weet, what dreadfull thing was there in hand;  
> Where when as two braue knights in bloudy fight  
> With deadly rancour he enraunged fond,  
> His sunbroad shield about his wrest he bond,  
> And shyning blade vnsheathd, with which he ran  
> Vnto that stead, their strife to vnderstond;  
> And at his first arriuall, them began  
> With goodly meanes to pacifie, well as he can.
>
> But they him spying, both with greedy forse  
> Attonce vpon him ran, and him beset  
> With strokes of mortall steele without remorse,  
> And on his shield like yron sledges bet:  
> As when a Beare and Tygre being met  
> In cruell fight on lybicke Ocean wide,  
> Espye a traueiler with feet surbet,  
> Whom they in equall pray hope to deuide,  
> They stint their strife, and him assaile on euery side.
>
> But he, not like a wearie traueilere,  
> Their sharpe assault right boldly did rebut,  
> And suffred not their blowes to byte him nere  
> But with redoubled buffes them backe did put:  
> Whose grieued mindes, which choler did englut,  
> Against themselues turning their wrathfull spight,  
> Gan with new rage their shields to hew and cut;  
> But still when *Guyon* came to part their fight,  
> With heauie load on him they freshly gan to smight.
>
> As a tall ship tossed in troublous seas,  
> Whom raging windes threatning to make the pray  
> Of the rough rockes, do diuersly disease,  
> Meetes two contrary billowes by the way,  
> That her on either side do sore assay,  
> And boast to swallow her in greedy graue;  
> She scorning both their spights, does make wide way,  
> And with her brest breaking the fomy waue,  
> Does ride on both their backs, & faire her selfe doth saue.
>
> So boldly he him beares, and rusheth forth  
> Betweene them both, by conduct of his blade.  
> Wondrous great prowesse and heroick worth  
> He shewd that day, and rare ensample made,  
> When two so mighty warriours he dismade:  
> Attonce he wards and strikes, he takes and payes,  
> Now forst to yield, now forcing to inuade,  
> Before, behind, and round about him layes:  
> So double was his paines, so double be his prayse.
>
> Straunge sort of fight, three valiaunt knights to see  
> Three combats ioyne in one, and to darraine  
> A triple warre with triple enmitee,  
> All for their Ladies froward loue to gaine,  
> Which gotten was but hate. So loue does raine  
> In stoutest minds, and maketh monstrous warre;  
> He maketh warre, he maketh peace againe,  
> And yet his peace is but continuall iarre:  
> O miserable men, that to him subiect arre.
>
> Whilst thus they mingled were in furious armes,  
> The faire *Medina* with her tresses torne,  
> And naked brest, in pitty of their harmes,  
> Emongst them ran, and falling them beforne,  
> Besought them by the womb, which them had borne,  
> And by the loues, which were to them most deare,  
> And by the knighthood, which they sure had sworne,  
> Their deadly cruell discord to forbeare,  
> And to her iust conditions of faire peace to heare.
>
> But her two other sisters standing by,  
> Her lowd gainsaid, and both their champions bad  
> Pursew the end of their strong enmity,  
> As euer of their loues they would be glad.  
> Yet she with pitthy words and counsell sad,  
> Still stroue their stubborne rages to reuoke,  
> That at the last suppressing fury mad,  
> They gan abstaine from dint of direfull stroke,  
> And hearken to the sober speaches, which she spoke.
>
> Ah puissaunt Lords, what cursed euill Spright,  
> Or fell *Erinnys*, in your noble harts  
> Her hellish brond hath kindled with despight,  
> And stird you vp to worke your wilfull smarts?  
> Is this the ioy of armes? be these the parts  
> Of glorious knighthood, after bloud to thrust,  
> And not regard dew right and iust desarts?  
> Vaine is the vaunt, and victory vniust,  
> That more to mighty hãds, thẽ rightfull cause doth trust.
>
> And were there rightfull cause of difference,  
> Yet were not better, faire it to accord,  
> Then with bloud guiltinesse to heape offence,  
> And mortall vengeaunce ioyne to crime abhord?  
> O fly from wrath, fly, O my liefest Lord:  
> Sad be the sights, and bitter fruits of warre,  
> And thousand furies wait on wrathfull sword;  
> Ne ought the prayse of prowesse more doth marre,  
> Then fowle reuenging rage, and base contentious iarre.
>
> But louely concord, and most sacred peace  
> Doth nourish vertue, and fast friendship breeds;  
> Weake she makes strõg, & strõg thing does increace,  
> Till it the pitch of highest prayse exceeds:  
> Braue be her warres, and honorable deeds,  
> By which she triumphes ouer ire and pride,  
> And winnes an Oliue girlond for her meeds:  
> Be therefore, O my deare Lords, pacifide,  
> And this misseeming discord meekely lay aside.
>
> Her gracious words their rancour did appall,  
> And suncke so deepe into their boyling brests,  
> That downe they let their cruell weapons fall,  
> And lowly did abase their loftie crests  
> To her faire presence, and discrete behests.  
> Then she began a treatie to procure,  
> And stablish termes betwixt both their requests,  
> That as a law for euer should endure;  
> Which to obserue in word of knights they did assure.
>
> Which to confirme, and fast to bind their league,  
> After their wearie sweat and bloudy toile,  
> She them besought, during their quiet treague,  
> Into her lodging to repaire a while,  
> To rest themselues, and grace to reconcile.  
> They soone consent: so forth with her they fare,  
> Where they are well receiu'd, and made to spoile  
> Themselues of soiled armes, and to prepare  
> Their minds to pleasure, & their mouthes to dainty fare.
>
> And those two froward sisters, their faire loues  
> Came with them eke, all were they wondrous loth,  
> And fained cheare, as for the time behoues,  
> But could not colour yet so well the troth,  
> But that their natures bad appeard in both:  
> For both did at their second sister grutch,  
> And inly grieue, as doth an hidden moth  
> The inner garment fret, not th'vtter touch;  
> One thought their cheare too litle, th'other thought too mutch.
>
> *Elissa* (so the eldest hight) did deeme  
> Such entertainment base, ne ought would eat,  
> Ne ought would speake, but euermore did seeme  
> As discontent for want of merth or meat;  
> No solace could her Paramour intreat,  
> Her once to show, ne court, nor dalliance,  
> But with bent lowring browes, as she would threat,  
> She scould, and frownd with froward countenaunce,  
> Vnworthy of faire Ladies comely gouernaunce.
>
> But young *Perissa* was of other mind,  
> Full of disport, still laughing, loosely light,  
> And quite contrary to her sisters kind;  
> No measure in her mood, no rule of right,  
> But poured out in pleasure and delight;  
> In wine and meats she flowd aboue the bancke,  
> And in excesse exceeded her owne might;  
> In sumptuous tire she ioyd her selfe to prancke,  
> But of her loue too lauish (litle haue she thancke.)
>
> Fast by her side did sit the bold *Sans-loy*  
> Fit mate for such a mincing mineon,  
> Who in her loosenesse tooke exceeding ioy;  
> Might not be found a franker franion,  
> Of her lewd parts to make companion;  
> But *Huddibras*, more like a Malecontent,  
> Did see and grieue at his bold fashion;  
> Hardly could he endure his hardiment,  
> Yet still he sat, and inly did him selfe torment.
>
> Betwixt them both the faire *Medina* sate  
> With sober grace, and goodly carriage:  
> With equall measure she did moderate  
> The strong extremities of their outrage;  
> That forward paire she euer would asswage,  
> When they would striue dew reason to exceed;  
> But that same froward twaine would accourage,  
> And of her plenty adde vnto their need:  
> So kept she them in order, and her selfe in heed.
>
> Thus fairely she attempered her feast,  
> And pleasd them all with meete satietie,  
> At last when lust of meat and drinke was ceast,  
> She *Guyon* deare besought of curtesie,  
> To tell from whence he came through ieopardie,  
> And whither now on new aduenture bound.  
> Who with bold grace, and comely grauitie,  
> Drawing to him the eyes of all around,  
> From lofty siege began these words aloud to sound.
>
> This thy demaund, ô Lady, doth reuiue  
> Fresh memory in me of that great Queene,  
> Great and most glorious virgin Queene aliue,  
> That with her soueraigne powre, and scepter shene  
> All Faery lond does peaceable sustene.  
> In widest Ocean she her throne does reare,  
> That ouer all the earth it may be seene;  
> As morning Sunne her beames dispredden cleare,  
> And in her face faire peace, and mercy doth appeare.
>
> In her the richesse of all heauenly grace  
> In chiefe degree are heaped vp on hye:  
> And all that else this worlds enclosure bace,  
> Hath great or glorious in mortall eye.  
> Adornes the person of her Maiestie;  
> That men beholding so great excellence,  
> And rare perfection in mortalitie,  
> Do her adore with sacred reuerence,  
> As th'Idole of her makers great magnificence.
>
> To her I homage and my seruice owe,  
> In number of the noblest knights on ground,  
> Mongst whom on me she deigned to bestowe  
> Order of *Maydenhead*, the most renownd,  
> That may this day in all the world be found:  
> An yearely solemne feast she wontes to make  
> The day that first doth lead the yeare around;  
> To which all knights of worth and courage bold  
> Resort, to heare of straunge aduentures to be told.
>
> There this old Palmer shewed himselfe that day,  
> And to that mighty Princesse did complaine  
> Of grieuous mischiefes, which a wicked Fay  
> Had wrought, and many whelmd in deadly paine,  
> Whereof he crau'd redresse. My Soueraine,  
> Whose glory is in gracious deeds, and ioyes  
> Throughout the world her mercy to maintaine,  
> Eftsoones deuisd redresse for such annoyes;  
> Me all vnfit for so great purpose she employes.
>
> Now hath faire *Phoebe* with her siluer face  
> Thrise seene the shadowes of the neather world,  
> Sith last I left that honorable place,  
> In which her royall presence is introld;  
> Ne euer shall I rest in house nor hold,  
> Till I that false *Acrasia* haue wonne;  
> Of whose fowle deedes, too hideous to be told  
> I witnesse am, and this their wretched sonne,  
> Whose wofull parents she hath wickedly fordonne.
>
> Tell on, faire Sir, said she, that dolefull tale,  
> From which sad ruth does seeme you to restraine,  
> That we may pitty such vnhappy bale,  
> And learne from pleasures poyson to abstaine:  
> Ill by ensample good doth often gayne.  
> Then forward he his purpose gan pursew,  
> And told the storie of the mortall payne,  
> Which *Mordant* and *Amauia* did rew;  
> As with lamenting eyes him selfe did lately vew.
>
> Night was far spent, and now in *Ocean* deepe  
> *Orion*, flying fast from hissing snake,  
> His flaming head did hasten for to steepe,  
> When of his pitteous tale he end did make;  
> Whilest with delight of that he wisely spake,  
> Those guestes beguiled, did beguile their eyes  
> Of kindly sleepe, that did them ouertake.  
> At last when they had markt the chaunged skyes,  
> They wist their houre was spẽt; thẽ each to rest him hyes.
