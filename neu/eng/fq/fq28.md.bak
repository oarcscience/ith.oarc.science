*Cant. II.*

> *The Redcrosse knight to Britomart  
> describeth Artegall:  
> The wondrous myrrhour, by which she  
> in loue with him did fall.*

> H Ere haue I cause, in men iust blame to find,  
> That in their proper prayse too partiall bee,  
> And not indifferent to woman kind,  
> To whom no share in armes and cheualrie  
> They do impart, ne maken memorie  
> Of their braue gestes and prowesse martiall;  
> Scarse do they spare to one or two or three,  
> Rowme in their writs; yet the same writing small  
> Does all their deeds deface, and dims their glories all.
>
> But by record of antique times I find,  
> That women wont in warres to beare most sway,  
> And to all great exploits them selues inclind:  
> Of which they still the girlond bore away,  
> Till enuious Men fearing their rules decay,  
> Gan coyne streight lawes to curb their liberty;  
> Yet sith they warlike armes haue layd away:  
> They haue exceld in artes and pollicy,  
> That now we foolish men that prayse gin eke t'enuy.
>
> Of warlike puissaunce in ages spent,  
> Be thou faire *Britomart*, whose prayse I write,  
> But of all wisedome be thou precedent,  
> O soueraigne Queene, whose prayse I would endite,  
> Endite I would as dewtie doth excite;  
> But ah my rimes too rude and rugged arre,  
> When in so high an obiect they do lite,  
> And striuing, fit to make, I feare do marre:  
> Thy selfe thy prayses tell, and make them knowen farre.
>
> She trauelling with *Guyon* by the way,  
> Of sundry things faire purpose gan to find,  
> T'abridg their iourney long, and lingring day;  
> Mongst which it fell into that Faeries mind,  
> To aske this Briton Mayd, what vncouth wind,  
> Brought her into those parts, and what inquest  
> Made her dissemble her disguised kind:  
> Faire Lady she him seemd, like Lady drest,  
> But fairest knight aliue, when armed was her brest.
>
> Thereat she sighing softly, had no powre  
> To speake a while, ne ready answere make,  
> But with hart-thrilling throbs and bitter stowre,  
> As if she had a feuer fit, did quake,  
> And euery daintie limbe with horrour shake;  
> And euer and anone the rosy red,  
> Flasht through her face, as it had been a flake  
> Of lightning, through bright heauen fulmined;  
> At last the passion past she thus him answered.
>
> Faire Sir, I let you weete, that from the howre  
> I taken was from nourses tender pap,  
> I haue beene trained vp in warlike stowre,  
> To tossen speare and shield, and to affrap  
> The warlike ryder to his most mishap;  
> Sithence I loathed haue my life to lead,  
> As Ladies wont, in pleasures wanton lap,  
> To finger the fine needle and nyce thread;  
> Me leuer were with point of foemans speare be dead.
>
> All my delight on deedes of armes is set,  
> To hunt out perils and aduentures hard,  
> By sea, by land, where so they may be met,  
> Onely for honour and for high regard,  
> Without respect of richesse or reward.  
> For such intent into these parts I came,  
> Withouten compasse, or withouten card,  
> Far fro my natiue soyle, that is by name  
> The greater *Britaine*, here to seeke for prayse and fame.
>
> Fame blazed hath, that here in Faery lond  
> Do many famous Knightes and Ladies wonne,  
> And many straunge aduentures to be fond,  
> Of which great worth and worship may be wonne;  
> Which I to proue, this voyage haue begonne.  
> But mote I weet of you, right curteous knight,  
> Tydings of one, that hath vnto me donne  
> Late foule dishonour and reprochfull spight,  
> The which I seeke to wreake, and *Arthegall* he hight.
>
> The word gone out, she backe againe would call,  
> As her repenting so to haue missayd,  
> But that he it vp-taking ere the fall,  
> Her shortly answered; Faire martiall Mayd  
> Certes ye misauised beene, t'vpbrayd  
> A gentle knight with so vnknightly blame:  
> For weet ye well of all, that euer playd  
> At tilt or tourney, or like warlike game,  
> The noble *Arthegall* hath euer borne the name.
>
> For thy great wonder were it, if such shame  
> Should euer enter in his bounteous thought,  
> Or euer do, that mote deseruen blame:  
> The noble courage neuer weeneth ought,  
> That may vnworthy of it selfe be thought.  
> Therefore, faire Damzell, be ye well aware,  
> Least that too farre ye haue your sorrow sought:  
> You and your countrey both I wish welfare,  
> And honour both; for each of other worthy are.
>
> The royall Mayd woxe inly wondrous glad,  
> To heare her Loue so highly magnifide,  
> And ioyd that euer she affixed had,  
> Her hart on knight so goodly glorifide,  
> How euer finely she it faind to hide:  
> The louing mother, that nine monethes did beare,  
> In the deare closet of her painefull side,  
> Her tender babe, it seeing safe appeare,  
> Doth not so much reioyce, as she reioyced theare.
>
> But to occasion him to further talke,  
> To feed her humour with his pleasing stile,  
> Her list in strifull termes with him to balke,  
> And thus replide, How euer, Sir, ye file  
> Your curteous tongue, his prayses to compile,  
> It ill beseemes a knight of gentle sort,  
> Such as ye haue him boasted, to beguile  
> A simple mayd, and worke so haynous tort,  
> In shame of knighthood, as I largely can report.
>
> Let be therefore my vengeaunce to disswade,  
> And read, where I that faytour false may find.  
> Ah, but if reason faire might you perswade,  
> To slake your wrath, and mollifie your mind,  
> (Said he) perhaps ye should it better find:  
> For hardy thing it is, to weene by might,  
> That man to hard conditions to bind,  
> Or euer hope to match in equall fight,  
> Whose prowesse paragon saw neuer liuing wight.
>
> Ne soothlich is it easie for to read,  
> Where now on earth, or how he may be found;  
> For he ne wonneth in one certaine stead,  
> But restlesse walketh all the world around,  
> Ay doing things, that to his fame redound,  
> Defending Ladies cause, and Orphans right,  
> Where so he heares, that any doth confound  
> Them comfortlesse, through tyranny or might:  
> So is his soueraine honour raisde to heauens hight.
>
> His feeling words her feeble sence much pleased,  
> And softly sunck into her molten hart;  
> Hart that is inly hurt, is greatly eased  
> With hope of thing, that may allegge his smart;  
> For pleasing words are like to Magick art,  
> That doth the charmed Snake in slomber lay:  
> Such secret ease felt gentle *Britomart*,  
> Yet list the same efforce with faind gainesay;  
> So dischord oft in Musick makes the sweeter lay.
>
> And said, Sir knight, these idle termes forbeare,  
> And sith it is vneath to find his haunt,  
> Tell me some markes, by which he may appeare,  
> If chaunce I him encounter parauaunt;  
> For perdie one shall other slay, or daunt:  
> What shape, what shield, what armes, what steed, what sted,  
> And what so else his person most may vaunt?  
> All which the *Redcrosse* knight to point ared,  
> And him in euery part before her fashioned.
>
> Yet him in euery part before she knew,  
> How euer list her now her knowledge faine,  
> Sith him whilome in *Britaine* she did vew,  
> To her reuealed in a mirrhour plaine,  
> Whereof did grow her first engraffed paine;  
> Whose root and stalke so bitter yet did tast,  
> That but the fruit more sweetnesse did containe,  
> Her wretched dayes in dolour she mote wast,  
> And yield the pray of loue to lothsome death at last.
>
> By strange occasion she did him behold,  
> And much more strangely gan to loue his sight,  
> As it in bookes hath written bene of old.  
> In *Deheubarth* that now South-wales is hight,  
> What time king *Ryence* raign'd, and dealed right,  
> The great Magitian *Merlin* had deuiz'd,  
> By his deepe science, and hell-dreaded might,  
> A looking glasse, right wondrously aguiz'd,  
> Whose vertues through the wyde world soone were solemniz'd.
>
> It vertue had, to shew in perfect sight,  
> What euer thing was in the world contaynd,  
> Betwixt the lowest earth and heauens hight,  
> So that it to the looker appertaynd;  
> What euer foe had wrought, or frend had faynd,  
> Therein discouered was, ne ought mote pas,  
> Ne ought in secret from the same remaynd;  
> For thy it round and hollow shaped was,  
> Like to the world it selfe, and seem'd a world of glas.
>
> Who wonders not, that reades so wonderous worke?  
> But who does wonder, that has red the Towre,  
> Wherein th'Ægyptian *Phao* long did lurke  
> From all mens vew, that none might her discoure,  
> Yet she might all men vew out of her bowre?  
> Great *Ptolomæe* it for his lemans sake  
> Ybuilded all of glasse, by Magicke powre,  
> And also it impregnable did make;  
> Yet when his loue was false, he with a peaze it brake.
>
> Such was the glassie globe that *Merlin* made,  
> And gaue vnto king *Ryence* for his gard,  
> That neuer foes his kingdome might inuade,  
> But he it knew at home before he hard  
> Tydings thereof, and so them still debar'd.  
> It was a famous Present for a Prince,  
> And worthy worke of infinite reward,  
> That treasons could bewray, and foes conuince;  
> Happie this Realme, had it remained euer since.
>
> One day it fortuned, faire *Britomart*  
> Into her fathers closet to repayre;  
> For nothing he from her reseru'd apart,  
> Being his onely daughter and his hayre;  
> Where when she had espyde that mirrhour fayre,  
> Her selfe a while therein she vewd in vaine;  
> Tho her auizing of the vertues rare,  
> Which thereof spoken were, she gan againe  
> Her to bethinke of, that mote to her selfe pertaine.
>
> But as it falleth, in the gentlest harts  
> Imperious Loue hath highest set his throne,  
> And tyrannizeth in the bitter smarts  
> Of them, that to him buxome are and prone:  
> So thought this Mayd (as maydens vse to done)  
> Whom fortune for her husband would allot,  
> Not that she lusted after any one;  
> For she was pure from blame of sinfull blot,  
> Yet wist her life at last must lincke in that same knot.
>
> Eftsoones there was presented to her eye  
> A comely knight, all arm'd in complete wize,  
> Through whose bright ventayle lifted vp on hye  
> His manly face, that did his foes agrize,  
> And friends to termes of gentle truce entize,  
> Lookt foorth, as *Phoebus* face out of the east,  
> Betwixt two shadie mountaines doth arize;  
> Portly his person was, and much increast  
> Through his Heroicke grace, and honorable gest.
>
> His crest was couered with a couchant Hound,  
> And all his armour seem'd of antique mould,  
> But wondrous massie and assured sound,  
> And round about yfretted all with gold,  
> In which there written was with cyphers old,  
> *Achilles armes, which Arthegall did win*.  
> And on his shield enueloped seuenfold  
> He bore a crowned litle Ermilin,  
> That deckt the azure field with her faire pouldred skin.
>
> The Damzell well did vew his personage,  
> And liked well, ne further fastned not,  
> But went her way; ne her vnguilty age  
> Did weene, vnwares, that her vnlucky lo t  
> Lay hidden in the bottome of the pot;  
> Of hurt vnwist most daunger doth redound:  
> But the false Archer, which that arrow shot  
> So slyly, that she did not feele the wound,  
> Did smyle full smoothly at her weetlesse wofull stound.
>
> Thenceforth the feather in her loftie crest,  
> Ruffed of loue, gan lowly to auaile,  
> And her proud portance, and her princely gest,  
> With which she earst tryumphed, now did quail  
> Sad, solemne, sowre, and full of fancies fraile  
> She woxe; yet wist she neither how, nor why,  
> She wist not, silly Mayd, what she did aile,  
> Yet wist, she was not well at ease perdy,  
> Yet thought it was not loue, but some melancholy.
>
> So soone as Night had with her pallid hew  
> Defast the beautie of the shining sky,  
> And reft from men the worlds desired vew,  
> She with her Nourse adowne to sleepe did lye;  
> But sleepe full farre away from her did fly:  
> In stead thereof sad sighes, and sorrowes deepe  
> Kept watch and ward about her warily,  
> That nought she did but wayle, and often steepe  
> He daintie couch with teares, which closely she did weepe.
>
> And if that any drop of slombring rest  
> Did chaunce to still into her wearie spright,  
> When feeble nature felt her selfe opprest,  
> Streight way with dreames, and with fantasticke sight  
> Of dreadfull things the same was put to flight,  
> That oft out of her bed she did astart,  
> As one with vew of ghastly feends affright:  
> Tho gan she to renew her former smart,  
> And thinke of that faire visage, written in her hart.
>
> One night, when she was tost with such vnrest,  
> Her aged Nurse, whose name was *Glauce* hight,  
> Feeling her leape out of her loathed nest,  
> Betwixt her feeble armes her quickly keight,  
> And downe againe in her warme bed her dight;  
> Ah my deare daughter, ah my dearest dread,  
> What vncouth fit (said she) what euill plight  
> Hath thee opprest, and with sad drearyhead  
> Chaunged thy liuely cheare, and liuing made thee dead?
>
> For not of nought these suddeine ghastly feares  
> All night afflict thy naturall repose,  
> And all the day, when as thine equall peares,  
> Their fit disports with faire delight doe chose,  
> Thou in dull corners doest thy selfe inclose,  
> Ne tastest Princes pleasures, ne doest spred  
> Abroad thy fresh youthes fairest flowre, but lose  
> Both leafe and fruit, both too vntimely shed,  
> As one in wilfull bale for euer buried.
>
> The time, that mortall men their weary cares  
> Do lay away, and all wilde beastes do rest,  
> And euery riuer eke his course forbeares  
> Then doth this wicked euill thee infest,  
> And riue with thousand throbs thy thrilled brest;  
> Like an huge *Aetn'* of deepe engulfed griefe,  
> Sorrow is heaped in thy hollow chest,  
> Whence forth it breakes in sighes and anguish rife,  
> As smoke and sulphure mingled with confused strife.
>
> Aye me, how much I feare, least loue it bee;  
> But if that loue it be, as sure I read  
> By knowen signes and passions, which I see,  
> Be it worthy of thy race and royall sead,  
> Then I auow by this most sacred head  
> Of my deare foster child, to ease thy griefe,  
> And win thy will: Therefore away doe dread;  
> For death nor daunger from thy dew reliefe  
> Shall me debarre, tell me therefore my liefest liefe.
>
> So hauing said, her twixt her armes twaine  
> She straightly straynd, and colled tenderly,  
> And euery trembling ioynt, and euery vaine  
> She softly felt, and rubbed busily,  
> To doe the frosen cold away to fly;  
> And her faire deawy eies with kisses deare  
> She oft did bath, and oft againe did dry;  
> And euer her importund, not to feare  
> To let the secret of her hart to her appeare.
>
> The Damzell pauzd, and then thus fearefully;  
> Ah Nurse, what needeth thee to eke my paine?  
> Is not enough, that I alone doe dye,  
> But it must doubled be with death of twaine?  
> For nought for me but death there doth remaine.  
> O daughter deare (said she) despaire no whit;  
> For neuer sore, but might a salue obtaine:  
> That blinded God, which hath ye blindly smit,  
> Another arrow hath your louers hart to hit.
>
> But mine is not (quoth she) like others wound;  
> For which no reason can find remedy.  
> Was neuer such, but mote the like be found,  
> (Said she) and though no reason may apply  
> Salue to your sore, yet loue can higher stye,  
> Then reasons reach, and oft hath wonders donne.  
> But neither God of loue, nor God of sky  
> Can doe (said she) that, which cannot be donne.  
> Things oft impossible (quoth she) seeme, ere begonne.
>
> These idle words (said she) doe nought asswage  
> My stubborne smart, but more annoyance breed,  
> For no no vsuall fire, no vsuall rage  
> It is, ô Nurse, which on my life doth feed,  
> And suckes the bloud, which from my hart doth bleed.  
> But since thy faithfull zeale lets me not hyde  
> My crime, (if crime it be) I will it reed.  
> Nor Prince, nor pere it is, whose loue hath gryde  
> My feeble brest of late, and launched this wound wyde.
>
> Nor man it is, nor other liuing wight;  
> For then some hope I might vnto me draw,  
> But th'only shade and semblant of a knight,  
> Whose shape or person yet I neuer saw,  
> Hath me subiected to loues cruell law:  
> The same one day, as me misfortune led,  
> I in my fathers wondrous mirrhour saw,  
> And pleased with that seeming goodly-hed,  
> Vnwares the hidden hooke with baite I swallowed.
>
> Sithens it hath infixed faster hold  
> Within my bleeding bowels, and so sore  
> Now ranckleth in this same fraile fleshly mould,  
> That all mine entrailes flow with poysnous gore,  
> And th'vlcer groweth daily more and more;  
> Ne can my running sore find remedie,  
> Other then my hard fortune to deplore,  
> And languish as the leafe falne from the tree,  
> Till death make one end of my dayes and miserie.
>
> Daughter (said she) what need ye be dismayd,  
> Or why make ye such Monster of your mind?  
> Of much more vncouth thing I was affrayd;  
> Of filthy lust, contrarie vnto kind:  
> But this affection nothing straunge I find;  
> For who with reason can you aye reproue,  
> To loue the semblant pleasing most your mind,  
> And yield your heart, whence ye cannot remoue?  
> No guilt in you, but in the tyranny of loue.
>
> Not so th'*Arabian Myrrhe* did set her mind;  
> Nor so did *Biblis* spend her pining hart,  
> But lou'd their natiue flesh against all kind,  
> And to their purpose vsed wicked art:  
> Yet playd *Pasiphaë* a more monstrous part,  
> That lou'd a Bull, and learnd a beast to bee;  
> Such shamefull lusts who loaths not, which depart  
> From course of nature and of modestie?  
> Sweet loue such lewdnes bands from his faire companie.
>
> But thine my Deare (welfare thy heart my deare)  
> Though strange beginning had, yet fixed is  
> On one, that worthy may perhaps appeare;  
> And certes seemes bestowed not amis:  
> Ioy thereof haue thou and eternall blis.  
> With that vpleaning on her elbow weake,  
> Her alablaster brest she soft did kis,  
> Which all that while she felt to pant and quake,  
> As it an Earth-quake were; at last she thus bespake.
>
> Beldame, your words doe worke me litle ease;  
> For though my loue be not so lewdly bent,  
> As those ye blame, yet may it nought appease  
> My raging smart, ne ought my flame relent,  
> But rather doth my helpelesse griefe augment.  
> For they, how euer shamefull and vnkind,  
> Yet did possesse their horrible intent:  
> Short end of sorrowes they thereby did find;  
> So was their fortune good, though wicked were their mind.
>
> But wicked fortune mine, though mind be good,  
> Can haue no end, nor hope of my desire,  
> But feed on shadowes, whiles I die for food,  
> And like a shadow wexe, whiles with entire  
> Affection, I doe languish and expire.  
> I fonder, then *Cephisus* foolish child,  
> Who hauing vewed in a fountaine shere  
> His face, was with the loue thereof beguild;  
> I fonder loue a shade, the bodie farre exild.
>
> Nought like (quoth she) for that same wretched boy  
> Was of himselfe the idle Paramoure;  
> Both loue and louer, without hope of ioy,  
> For which he faded to a watry flowre.  
> But better fortune thine, and better howre,  
> Which lou'st the shadow of a warlike knight;  
> No shadow, but a bodie hath in powre:  
> That bodie, wheresoeuer that it light,  
> May learned be by cyphers, or by Magicke might.
>
> But if thou may with reason yet represse  
> The growing euill, ere it strength haue got,  
> And thee abandond wholly doe possesse,  
> Against it strongly striue, and yield thee not,  
> Till thou in open field adowne be smot.  
> But if the passion mayster thy fraile might,  
> So that needs loue or death must be thy lot,  
> Then I auow to thee, by wrong or right  
> To compasse thy desire, and find that loued knight.
>
> Her chearefull words much cheard the feeble spright  
> Of the sicke virgin, that her downe she layd  
> In her warme bed to sleepe, if that she might;  
> And the old-woman carefully displayd  
> The clothes about her round with busie ayd;  
> So that at last a little creeping sleepe  
> Surprisd her sense: she therewith well apayd,  
> The drunken lampe downe in the oyle did steepe,  
> And set her by to watch, and set her by to weepe.
>
> Earely the morrow next, before that day  
> His ioyous face did to the world reueale,  
> They both vprose and tooke their readie way  
> Vnto the Church, their prayers to appeale,  
> With great deuotion, and with litle zeale:  
> For the faire Damzell from the holy herse  
> Her loue-sicke hart to other thoughts did steale;  
> And that old Dame said many an idle verse,  
> Out of her daughters hart fond fancies to reuerse.
>
> Returned home, the royall Infant fell  
> Into her former fit; for why, no powre  
> Nor guidance of her selfe in her did dwell.  
> But th'aged Nurse her calling to her bowre,  
> Had gathered Rew, and Sauine, and the flowre  
> Of *Camphara*, and Calamint, and Dill,  
> All which she in a earthen Pot did poure,  
> And to the brim with Colt wood did it fill,  
> And many drops of milke and bloud through it did spill.
>
> Then taking thrise three haires from off her head,  
> Them trebly breaded in a threefold lace,  
> And round about the pots mouth, bound the thread,  
> And after hauing whispered a space  
> Certaine sad words, with hollow voice and bace,  
> She to the virgin said, thrise said she it;  
> Come daughter come, come; spit vpon my face,  
> Spit thrise vpon me, thrise vpon me spit;  
> Th'vneuen number for this businesse is most fit.
>
> That sayd, her round about she from her turnd,  
> She turned her contrarie to the Sunne,  
> Thrise she her turnd contrary, and returnd,  
> All contrary, for she the right did shunne,  
> And euer what she did, was streight vndonne.  
> So thought she to vndoe her daughters loue:  
> But loue, that is in gentle brest begonne,  
> No idle charmes so lightly may remoue,  
> That well can witnesse, who by triall it does proue.
>
> Ne ought it mote the noble Mayd auayle,  
> Ne slake the furie of her cruell flame,  
> But that she still did waste, and still did wayle,  
> That through long languour, and hart-burning brame  
> She shortly like a pyned ghost became,  
> Which long hath waited by the Stygian strond.  
> That when old *Glauce* saw, for feare least blame  
> Of her miscarriage should in her be fond,  
> She wist not how t'amend, nor how it to withstond.
