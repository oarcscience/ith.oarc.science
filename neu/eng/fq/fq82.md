### Letter to Raleigh and Commendatory Poems, &c.

> > > Letter of the Authors expounding his  
> > > *whole intention in the course of this worke, which*  
> > > for that it giueth great light to the Reader, for  
> > > the better vnderstanding is hereunto  
> > > annexed.
> > >
> > > *To the Right noble, and Valorous, Sir Walter* Raleigh knight, Lo.
> > > Wardein of the Stanneryes, and her Maiesties lieftenaunt of the
> > > County of Cornewayll.
> > >
> > >  **S** *Ir knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be construed,
> > > and this booke of mine, which I have entituled the Faery Queene,
> > > being a continued Allegory, or darke conceit, I haue thought good
> > > aswell for auoyding of gealous opinions and miscõstructions, as
> > > also for your better light in reading thereof, (being so by you
> > > commanded) to discouer vnto you the general intention and meaning,
> > > which in the whole course thereof I haue fashioned, without
> > > expressing of any particular purposes or by accidents therein
> > > occasioned. The generall end therefore of all the booke is to
> > > fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle
> > > discipline: Which for that I conceiued shoulde be most plausible
> > > and pleasing, being coloured with an historicall fiction, the
> > > which the most part of men delight to read, rather for variety of
> > > matter, then for profite of the ensample: I chose the historye of
> > > king Arthure, as most fitte for the excellency of his person being
> > > made famous by many mens former workes, and also furthest from the
> > > daunger of enuy, and suspition of present time. In which I haue
> > > followed all the antique Poets historicall, first Homere, who in
> > > the Persons of Agamemnon and Vlysses hath ensampled a good
> > > gouernour and a vertuous man, the one in his Ilias, the other in
> > > his Odysseis: then Virgil, whose like intention was to doe in the
> > > person of Aeneas: after him Ariosto comprised them both in his
> > > Orlando: and lately Tasso disseuered them againe, and formed both
> > > parts in two persons, namely that part which they in Philosophy
> > > call Ethice, or vertues of a priuate man, coloured in his Rinaldo:
> > > The other named Politice in his Godfredo. By ensample of which
> > > excellente Poets, I labour to pourtraict in Arthure, before he was
> > > king, the image of a braue knight, perfected in the twelue morall
> > > vertues, as Aristotle hath deuised, the which is the purpose of
> > > these first twelue bookes: which if I finde to be well accepted, I
> > > may be perhaps encoraged, to frame the other part of polliticke
> > > vertues in his person, after that hee came to be king. To some I
> > > know this Methode will seeme displeasaunt, which had rather haue
> > > good discipline deliuered plainly in way of precepts, or sermoned
> > > at large, as they vse, then thus clowdily enrapped in Allegoricall
> > > deuises. But such, me seeme, should be satisfide with the vse of
> > > these dayes seeing all things accounted by their showes, and
> > > nothing esteemed of, that is not delightfull and pleasing to
> > > commune sence. For this cause Xenophon preferred before Plato, for
> > > that the one in the exquisite depth of his iudgement, formed a
> > > Commune welth such as it should be, but the other in the person of
> > > Cyrus and the Persians fashioned a gouernment such as it might
> > > best be: So much more profitable and gratious is doctrine by
> > > ensample, then by rule. So haue I laboured to doe in the person of
> > > Arthure: whome I conceiue after his long education by Timon, to
> > > whome he was by Merlin deliuered to be brought vp, so soone as he
> > > was borne of the Lady Igrayne, to haue seene in a dream or vision
> > > the Faery Queen, with whose excellent beauty rauished, he awaking
> > > resolued to seeke her out, and so being by Merlin armed, and by
> > > Timon throughly instructed, he went to seeke her forth in Faerye
> > > land. In that Faery Queene I meane glory in my generall intention,
> > > but in my particular I conceiue the most excellent and glorious
> > > person of our soueraine the Queene, and her kingdome in Faery
> > > land. And yet in some places els I do otherwise shadow her. For
> > > considering she beareth two persons, the one of a most royall
> > > Queene or Empresse, the other of a most vertuous and beautifull
> > > Lady, this latter part in some places I doe ezpresse in Belphoebe,
> > > fashioning her name according to your owne excellent conceipt of
> > > Cynthia (Phoebe and Cynthia being both names of Diana). So in the
> > > person of Prince Arthure I sette forth magnificence in particular,
> > > which vertue for that (according to Aristotle and the rest) it is
> > > the perfection of all the rest, and conteineth in it them all,
> > > therefore in the whole course I mention the deedes of Arthure
> > > applyable to that vertue, which I write of in that booke. But of
> > > the xii. other vertues, I make xii. other knights the patrones,
> > > for the more variety of the history. Of which these three bookes
> > > contayn three. The first of the knight of the Redcrosse, in whome
> > > I express Holynes. The seconde of Sir Guyon, in whome I sette
> > > forth Temperaunce: The third of Britomartis a Lady knight, in
> > > whome I picture Chastity. But because the beginning of the whole
> > > worke seemeth abrupte and as depending vpon other antecedents, it
> > > needs that ye know the occasion of these three knights seuerall
> > > aduentures. For the Methode of a Poet historical is not such, as
> > > of an Historiographer. For an Historiographer discourseth of
> > > affayres orderly as they were donne, accounting as well the times
> > > as the actions, but a Poet thrusteth into the middest, euen where
> > > it most concerneth him, and there recoursing to the thinges
> > > forepaste, and diuining of thinges to come, maketh a pleasing
> > > Analysis of all. The beginning therefore of my history, if it were
> > > to be told by an Historiographer should be the twelfth booke,
> > > which is the last, where I deuise that the Faery Queene kept her
> > > Annuall feaste xii. dayes, vppon which xii. seuerall dayes, the
> > > occasions of the xii. seuerall aduentures, hapned, which being
> > > vndertaken by xii. seuerall knights, are in these xii. books
> > > seuerally handled and discoursed. The first was this. In the
> > > beginning of the feast, there presented himselfe a tall clownish
> > > younge man, who falling before the Queen of Faries desired a boone
> > > (as the manner then was) which during that feast she might not
> > > refuse: which was that hee might haue the atchieument of any
> > > aduenture, which during that feaste should happen: that being
> > > graunted, he rested him on the floore, vnfitte through his
> > > rusticity for a better place. Soone after entred a faire Ladye in
> > > mourning weedes, riding on a white Asse, with a dwarfe behind her
> > > leading a warlike steed, that bore the Armes of a knight, and his
> > > speare in the dwarfes hand. Shee falling before the Queene of
> > > Faeries complayned that her father and mother an ancient King and
> > > Queene, had bene by an huge dragon many years shut vp in a brasen
> > > Castle, who thence suffred them not to yssew: and therefore
> > > besought the Faery Queene to assygne her some one of her knights
> > > to take on him that exployt. Presently that clownish person
> > > vpstarting, desired that aduenture: whereat the Queene much
> > > wondering, and the Lady much gainesaying, yet he earnestly
> > > importuned his desire. In the end the Lady told him that vnlesse
> > > that armour which she brought, would serue him (that is the armour
> > > of a Christian man specified by Saint Paul v. Ephes.) that he
> > > could not succeed in that enterprise, which being forthwith put
> > > upon him with dewe furnitures thereunto, he seemed the goodliest
> > > man in al that company, and was well liked of the Lady. And
> > > eftesoones taking on him knighthood, and mounting on that straunge
> > > Courser, he went forth with her on that aduenture: where beginneth
> > > the first booke, vz.*

> > > A gentle knight was pricking on the playne, &c.
> > >
> > > *The second day ther came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with
> > > bloody hands, whose Parents he complained to haue bene slayne by
> > > an Enchauntresse called Acrasia: and therfore craued of the Faery
> > > Queene, to appoint him some knight, to performe that aduenture,
> > > which being assigned to Sir Guyon, he presently went forth with
> > > that same Palmer: which is the beginning of the second booke and
> > > the whole subiect thereof. The third day there came in a Groome,
> > > who complained before the Faery Queene, that a vile Enchaunter

> > > whom he kept in most grieuous torment, because she would not yield
