T
He rugged forhead that with graue foresight<br>
Welds kingdomes causes, &amp; affaires of state,<br>
My looser rimes (I wote) doth sharply wite,<br>
For praising loue, as I haue done of late,<br>
And magnifying louers deare debate;<br>
By which fraile youth is oft to follie led,<br>
Through false allurement of that pleasing baite,<br>
That better were in vertues discipled,<br>
Then with vaine poemes weeds to haue their fancies fed.<p>

Such ones ill iudge of loue, that cannot loue,<br>
Ne in their frosen hearts feele kindly flame:<br>
For thy, they ought not thing vnknowne reproue,<br>
Ne naturall affection faultlesse blame,<br>
For fault of few that haue abusd the same.<br>
For it of honor and all vertue is<br>
The roote, and brings forth glorious flowres of fame,<br>
That crowne true louers with immortall blis,<br>
The meed of them that loue, and do not liue amisse.<p>

Which who so list looke backe to former ages,<br>
And call to count the things that then were donne,<br>
Shall find, that all the workes of those wise sages,<br>
And braue exploits which great Heroes wonne,<br>
In loue were either ended or begunne:<br>
Witnesse the father of Philosophie,<br>
Which to his <i>Critias</i>, shaded oft from sunne,<br>
Of loue full manie lessons did apply,<br>
The which these Stoicke censours cannot well deny.<p>

To such therefore I do not sing at all,<br>
But to that sacred Saint my soueraigne Queene,<br>
In whose chast breast all bountie naturall,<br>
And treasures of true loue enlocked beene,<br>
Boue all her sexe that euer yet was seene;<br>
To her I sing of loue, that loueth best,<br>
And best is lou'd of all aliue I weene:<br>
To her this song most fitly is addrest,<br>
The Queene of loue, &amp; Prince of peace fr&otilde; heauen blest.<p>

Which that she may the better deigne to heare,<br>
Do thou dred infant, <i>Venus</i> dearling doue,<br>
From her high spirit chase imperious feare,<br>
And vse of awfull Maiestie remoue:<br>
In sted thereof with drops of melting loue,<br>
Deawd with ambrosiall kisses, by thee gotten<br>
From thy sweete smyling mother from aboue,<br>
Sprinckle her heart, and haughtie courage soften,<br>
That she may hearke to loue, and reade this lesson often.<p>
