<blockquote> 
<i>Guyon, by Palmers gouernance,<br>
passing through perils great,<br>
Doth ouerthrow the Bowre of blisse,<br>
and Acrasie defeat.</i><p>

<blockquote> 
N
Ow gins this goodly frame of Temperance<br>
Fairely to rise, and her adorned hed<br>
To pricke of highest praise forth to aduance,<br>
Formerly grounded, and fast setteled<br>
On firme foundation of true bountihed;<br>
And this braue knight, that for that vertue fights,<br>
Now comes to point of that same perilous sted,<br>
Where Pleasure dwelles in sensuall delights,<br>
M&otilde;gst thousand dangers, &amp; ten thousand magick mights.<p>
 
Two dayes now in that sea he sayled has,<br>
Ne euer land beheld, ne liuing wight,<br>
Ne ought saue perill, still as he did pas:<br>
Tho when appeared the third <i>Morrow</i> bright,<br>
Vpon the waues to spred her trembling light,<br>
An hideous roaring farre away they heard,<br>
That all their senses filled with affright,<br>
And streight they saw the raging surges reard<br>
Vp to the skyes, that them of drowning made affeard.<p>
 
Said then the Boteman, Palmer stere aright,<br>
And keepe an euen course; for yonder way<br>
We needes must passe (God do vs well acquight,)<br>
That is the <i>Gulfe of Greedinesse</i>, they say,<br>
That deepe engorgeth all this worldes pray:<br>
Which hauing swallowd vp excessiuely,<br>
He soone in vomit vp againe doth lay,<br>
And belcheth forth his superfluity,<br>
That all the seas for feare do seeme away to fly.<p>
 
On th'other side an hideous Rocke is pight,<br>
Of mightie <i>Magnes</i> stone, whose craggie clift<br>
Depending from on high, dreadfull to sight,<br>
Ouer the waues his rugged armes doth lift,<br>
And threatneth downe to throw his ragged rift<br>
On who so commeth nigh; yet nigh it drawes<br>
All passengers, that none from it can shift:<br>
For whiles they fly that Gulfes deuouring iawes,<br>
They on this rock are rent, and sunck in helplesse wawes.<p>
 
Forward they passe, and strongly he them rowes,<br>
Vntill they nigh vnto that Gulfe arriue,<br>
Where streame more violent and greedy growes:<br>
Then he with all his puissance doth striue<br>
To strike his oares, and mightily doth driue<br>
The hollow vessell through the threatfull waue,<br>
Which gaping wide, to swallow them aliue,<br>
In th'huge abysse of his engulfing graue,<br>
Doth rore at them in vaine, and with great terror raue.<p>
 
They passing by, that griesly mouth did see,<br>
Sucking the seas into his entralles deepe,<br>
That seem'd more horrible then hell to bee,<br>
Or that darke dreadfull hole of <i>Tartare</i> steepe,<br>
Through which the damned ghosts doen often creepe<br>
Backe to the world, bad liuers to torment:<br>
But nought that falles into this direfull deepe,<br>
Ne that approcheth nigh the wide descent,<br>
May backe returne, but is condemned to be drent.<p>
 
On th'other side, they saw that perilous Rocke,<br>
Threatning it selfe on them to ruinate,<br>
On whose sharpe clifts the ribs of vessels broke,<br>
And shiuered ships, which had bene wrecked late,<br>
Yet stuck, with carkasses exanimate<br>
Of such, as hauing all their substance spent<br>
In wanton ioyes, and lustes intemperate,<br>
Did afterwards make shipwracke violent,<br>
Both of their life, and fame for euer fowly blent.<p>
 
For thy, this hight <i>The Rocke of</i> vile <i>Reproch</i>,<br>
A daungerous and detestable place,<br>
To which nor fish nor fowle did once approch,<br>
But yelling Meawes, with Seagulles hoarse and bace,<br>
And Cormoyrants, with birds of rauenous race,<br>
Which still sate waiting on that wastfull clift,<br>
For spoyle of wretches, whose vnhappie cace,<br>
After lost credite and consumed thrift,<br>
At last them driuen hath to this despairefull drift.<p>
 
The Palmer seeing them in safetie past,<br>
Thus said; Behold th'ensamples in our sights,<br>
Of lustfull luxurie and thriftlesse wast:<br>
What now is left of miserable wights,<br>
Which spent their looser daies in lewd delights,<br>
But shame and sad reproch, here to be red,<br>
By these rent reliques, speaking their ill plights?<br>
Let all that liue, hereby be counselled,<br>
To shunne <i>Rocke of Reproch</i>, and it as death to dred.<p>
 
So forth they rowed, and that <i>Ferryman</i><br>
With his stiffe oares did brush the sea so strong,<br>
That the hoare waters from his frigot ran,<br>
And the light bubbles daunced all along,<br>
Whiles the salt brine out of the billowes sprong.<br>
At last farre off they many Islands spy,<br>
On euery side floting the floods emong:<br>
Then said the knight, Loe I the land descry,<br>
Therefore old Syre thy course do thereunto apply.<p>
 
That may not be, said then the <i>Ferryman</i><br>
Least we vnweeting hap to be fordonne:<br>
For those same Islands, seeming now and than,<br>
Are not firme land, nor any certein wonne,<br>
But straggling plots, which to and fro do ronne<br>
In the wide waters: therefore are they hight<br>
The <i>wandring Islands</i>.  Therefore doe them shonne;<br>
For they haue oft drawne many a wandring wight<br>
Into most deadly daunger and distressed plight.<p>
 
Yet well they seeme to him, that farre doth vew,<br>
Both faire and fruitfull, and the ground dispred<br>
With grassie greene of delectable hew,<br>
And the tall trees with leaues apparelled,<br>
Are deckt with blossomes dyde in white and red,<br>
That mote the passengers thereto allure;<br>
But whosoeuer once hath fastened<br>
His foot thereon, may neuer it recure,<br>
But wandreth euer more vncertein and vnsure.<p>
 
As th'Isle of <i>Delos</i> whylome men report<br>
Amid th'<i>Aeg&aelig;an</i> sea long time did stray,<br>
Ne made for shipping any certaine port,<br>
Till that <i>Latona</i> traueiling that way,<br>
Flying from <i>Iunoes</i> wrath and hard assay,<br>
Of her faire twins was there deliuered,<br>
Which afterwards did rule the night and day;<br>
Thenceforth it firmely was established,<br>
And for <i>Apolloes</i> honor highly herried.<p>
 
They to him hearken, as beseemeth meete,<br>
And passe on forward: so their way does ly,<br>
That one of those same Islands, which doe fleet<br>
In the wide sea, they needes must passen by,<br>
Which seemd so sweet and pleasant to the eye,<br>
That it would tempt a man to touchen there:<br>
Vpon the banck they sitting did espy<br>
A daintie damzell, dressing of her heare,<br>
By whom a litle skippet floting did appeare.<p>
 
She them espying, loud to them can call,<br>
Bidding them nigher draw vnto the shore;<br>
For she had cause to busie them withall;<br>
And therewith loudly laught: But nathemore<br>
Would they once turne, but kept on as afore:<br>
Which when she saw, she left her lockes vndight,<br>
And running to her boat withouten ore,<br>
From the departing land it launched light,<br>
And after them did driue with all her power and might.<p>
 
Whom ouertaking, she in merry sort<br>
Them gan to bord, and purpose diuersly,<br>
Now faining dalliance and wanton sport,<br>
Now throwing forth lewd words immodestly;<br>
Till that the Palmer gan full bitterly<br>
Her to rebuke, for being loose and light:<br>
Which not abiding, but more scornefully<br>
Scoffing at him, that did her iustly wite,<br>
She turnd her bote about, and from them rowed quite.<p>
 
That was the wanton <i>Phoedria</i>, which late<br>
Did ferry him ouer the <i>Idle lake</i>:<br>
Whom nought regarding, they kept on their gate,<br>
And all her vaine allurements did forsake,<br>
When them the wary Boateman thus bespake;<br>
Here now behoueth vs well to auyse,<br>
And of our safetie good heede to take;<br>
For here before a perlous passage lyes,<br>
Where many Mermayds haunt, making false melodies.<p>
 
But by the way, there is a great Quicksand,<br>
And a whirlepoole of hidden ieopardy,<br>
Therefore, Sir Palmer, keepe an euen hand;<br>
For twixt them both the narrow way doth ly.<br>
Scarse had he said, when hard at hand they spy<br>
That quicksand nigh with water couered;<br>
But by the checked waue they did descry<br>
It plaine, and by the sea discoloured:<br>
It called was the quicksand of <i>Vnthriftyhed</i>.<p>
 
They passing by, a goodly Ship did see,<br>
Laden from far with precious merchandize,<br>
And brauely furnished, as ship might bee,<br>
Which through great disauenture, or mesprize,<br>
Her selfe had runne into that hazardize;<br>
Whose mariners and merchants with much toyle,<br>
Labour'd in vaine, to haue recur'd their prize,<br>
And the rich wares to saue from pitteous spoyle,<br>
But neither toyle nor trauell might her backe recoyle.<p>
 
On th'other side they see that perilous Poole,<br>
That called was the <i>VVhirlepoole of decay</i>,<br>
In which full many had with haplesse doole<br>
Beene suncke, of whom no memorie did stay:<br>
Whose circled waters rapt with whirling sway,<br>
Like to a restlesse wheele, still running round,<br>
Did couet, as they passed by that way,<br>
To draw their boate within the vtmost bound<br>
Of his wide <i>Labyrinth</i>, and then to haue them dround.<p>
 
But th'heedfull Boateman strongly forth did stretch<br>
His brawnie armes, and all his body straine,<br>
That th'vtmost sandy breach they shortly fetch,<br>
Whiles the dred daunger does behind remaine.<br>
Suddeine they see from midst of all the Maine,<br>
The surging waters like a mountaine rise,<br>
And the great sea puft vp with proud disdaine,<br>
To swell aboue the measure of his guise,<br>
As threatning to deuoure all, that his powre despise.<p>
 
The waues come rolling, and the billowes rore<br>
Outragiously, as they enraged were,<br>
Or wrathfull <i>Neptune</i> did them driue before<br>
His whirling charet, for exceeding feare:<br>
For not one puffe of wind there did appeare,<br>
That all the three thereat woxe much afrayd,<br>
Vnweeting, what such horrour straunge did reare.<br>
Eftsoones they saw an hideous hoast arrayd,<br>
Of huge Sea monsters, such as liuing sence dismayd.<p>
 
Most vgly shapes, and horrible aspects,<br>
Such as Dame Nature selfe mote feare to see,<br>
Or shame, that euer should so fowle defects<br>
From her most cunning hand escaped bee;<br>
All dreadfull pourtraicts of deformitee:<br>
Spring-headed <i>Hydraes</i>, and sea-shouldring Whales,<br>
Great whirlpooles, which all fishes make to flee,<br>
Bright Scolopendraes, arm'd with siluer scales,<br>
Mighty <i>Monoceroses</i>, with immeasured tayles.<p>
 
The dreadfull Fish, that hath deseru'd the name<br>
Of Death, and like him lookes in dreadfull hew,<br>
The griesly Wasserman, that makes his game<br>
The flying ships with swiftnesse to pursew,<br>
The horrible Sea-satyre, that doth shew<br>
His fearefull face in time of greatest storme,<br>
Huge <i>Ziffius</i>, whom Mariners eschew<br>
No lesse, then rockes, (as trauellers informe,)<br>
And greedy <i>Rosmarines</i> with visages deforme.<p>
 
All these, and thousand thousands many more,<br>
And more deformed Monsters thousand fold,<br>
With dreadfull noise, and hollow rombling rore,<br>
Came rushing in the fomy waues enrold,<br>
Which seem'd to fly for feare, them to behold:<br>
Ne wonder, if these did the knight appall;<br>
For all that here on earth we dreadfull hold,<br>
Be but as bugs to fearen babes withall,<br>
Compared to the creatures in the seas entrall.<p>
 
Feare nought, (then said the Palmer well auiz'd;)<br>
For these same Monsters are not these in deed,<br>
But are into these fearefull shapes disguiz'd<br>
By that same wicked witch, to worke vs dreed,<br>
And draw from on this iourney to proceede.<br>
Tho lifting vp his vertuous staffe on hye,<br>
He smote the sea, which calmed was with speed,<br>
And all that dreadfull Armie fast gan flye<br>
Into great <i>Tethys</i> bosome, where they hidden lye.<p>
 
Quit from that daunger, forth their course they kept,<br>
And as they went, they heard a ruefull cry<br>
Of one, that wayld and pittifull[y] wept,<br>
That through the sea the resounding plaints did fly:<br>
At last they in an Island did espy<br>
A seemely Maiden, sitting by the shore,<br>
That with great sorrow and sad agony,<br>
Seemed some great misfortune to deplore,<br>
And lowd to them for succour called euermore.<p>
 
Which <i>Guyon</i> hearing, streight his Palmer bad,<br>
To stere the boate towards that dolefull Mayd,<br>
That he might know, and ease her sorrow sad:<br>
Who him auizing better, to him sayd;<br>
Faire Sir, be not displeasd, if disobayd:<br>
For ill it were to hearken to her cry;<br>
For she is inly nothing ill apayd,<br>
But onely womanish fine forgery,<br>
Your stubborne hart t'affect with fraile infirmity.<p>
 
To which when she your courage hath inclind<br>
Through foolish pitty, then her guilefull bayt<br>
She will embosome deeper in your mind,<br>
And for your ruine at the last awayt.<br>
The knight was ruled, and the Boateman strayt<br>
Held on his course with stayed stedfastnesse,<br>
Ne euer shruncke, ne euer sought to bayt<br>
His tyred armes for toylesome wearinesse,<br>
But with his oares did sweepe the watry wildernesse.<p>
 
And now they nigh approched to the sted,<br>
Where as those Mermayds dwelt: it was a still<br>
And calmy bay, on th'one side sheltered<br>
With the brode shadow of an hoarie hill,<br>
On th'other side an high rocke toured still,<br>
That twixt them both a pleasaunt port they made,<br>
And did like an halfe Theatre fulfill:<br>
There those fiue sisters had continuall trade,<br>
And vsd to bath themselues in that deceiptfull shade.<p>
 
They were faire Ladies, till they fondly striu'd<br>
With th'<i>Heliconian</i> maides for maistery;<br>
Of whom they ouer-comen, were depriu'd<br>
Of their proud beautie, and th'one moyity<br>
Transform'd to fish, for their bold surquedry,<br>
But th'vpper halfe their hew retained still,<br>
And their sweet skill in wonted melody;<br>
Which euer after they abusd to ill,<br>
T'allure weake trauellers, whom gotten they did kill.<p>
 
So now to <i>Guyon</i>, as he passed by,<br>
Their pleasaunt tunes they sweetly thus applide;<br>
O thou faire sonne of gentle Faery,<br>
That art in mighty armes most magnifide<br>
Aboue all knights, that euer battell tride,<br>
O turne thy rudder hither-ward a while:<br>
Here may thy storme-bet vessell safely ride;<br>
This is the Port of rest from troublous toyle,<br>
The worlds sweet In, from paine &amp; wearisome turmoyle.<p>
 
With that the rolling sea resounding soft,<br>
In his big base them fitly answered,<br>
And on the rocke the waues breaking aloft,<br>
A solemne Meane vnto them measured,<br>
The whiles sweet <i>Zephirus</i> lowd whisteled<br>
His treble, a straunge kinde of harmony;<br>
Which <i>Guyons</i> senses softly tickeled,<br>
That he the boateman bad row easily,<br>
And let him heare some part of their rare melody.<p>
 
But him the Palmer from that vanity,<br>
With temperate aduice discounselled,<br>
That they it past, and shortly gan descry<br>
The land, to which their course they leueled;<br>
When suddeinly a grosse fog ouer spred<br>
With his dull vapour all that desert has,<br>
And heauens chearefull face enueloped,<br>
That all things one, and one as nothing was,<br>
And this great Vniuerse seemd one confused mas.<p>
 
Thereat they greatly were dismayd, ne wist<br>
How to direct their way in darkenesse wide,<br>
But feard to wander in that wastfull mist,<br>
For tombling into mischiefe vnespide.<br>
Worse is the daunger hidden, then descride.<br>
Suddeinly an innumerable flight<br>
Of harmefull fowles about them fluttering, cride,<br>
And with their wicked wings them oft did smight,<br>
And sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.<p>
 
Euen all the nation of vnfortunate<br>
And fatall birds about them flocked were,<br>
Such as by nature men abhorre and hate,<br>
The ill-faste Owle, deaths dreadfull messengere,<br>
The hoars Night-rauen, trump of dolefull drere,<br>
The lether-winged Bat, dayes enimy,<br>
The ruefull Strich, still waiting on the bere,<br>
The Whistler shrill, that who so heares, doth dy,<br>
The hellish Harpies, prophets of sad destiny.<p>
 
All those, and all that else does horrour breed,<br>
About them flew, and fild their sayles with feare:<br>
Yet stayd they not, but forward did proceed,<br>
Whiles th'one did row, and th'other stifly steare;<br>
Till that at last the weather gan to cleare,<br>
And the faire land it selfe did plainly show.<br>
Said then the Palmer, Lo where does appeare<br>
The sacred soile, where all our perils grow;<br>
Therefore, Sir knight, your ready armes about you throw.<p>
 
He hearkned, and his armes about him tooke,<br>
The whiles the nimble boate so well her sped,<br>
That with her crooked keele the land she strooke,<br>
Then forth the noble <i>Guyon</i> sallied,<br>
And his sage Palmer, that him gouerned;<br>
But th'other by his boate behind did stay.<br>
They marched fairly forth, of nought ydred,<br>
Both firmely armd for euery hard assay,<br>
With constancy and care, gainst daunger and dismay.<p>
 
Ere long they heard an hideous bellowing<br>
Of many beasts, that roard outrageously,<br>
As if that hungers point, or <i>Venus</i> sting<br>
Had them enraged with fell surquedry;<br>
Yet nought they feard, but past on hardily,<br>
Vntill they came in vew of those wild beasts:<br>
Who all attonce, gaping full greedily,<br>
And rearing fiercely their vpstarting crests,<br>
Ran towards, to deuoure those vnexpected guests.<p>
 
But soone as they approcht with deadly threat,<br>
The Palmer ouer them his staffe vpheld,<br>
His mighty staffe, that could all charmes defeat:<br>
Eftsoones their stubborne courages were queld,<br>
And high aduaunced crests downe meekely feld,<br>
In stead of fraying, they them selues did feare,<br>
And trembled, as them passing they beheld:<br>
Such wondrous powre did in that staffe appeare,<br>
All monsters to subdew to him, that did it beare.<p>
 
Of that same wood it fram'd was cunningly,<br>
Of which <i>Caduceus</i> whilome was made,<br>
<i>Caduceus</i> the rod of <i>Mercury</i>,<br>
With which he wonts the <i>Stygian</i> realmes inuade,<br>
Through ghastly horrour, and eternall shade;<br>
Th'infernall feends with it he can asswage,<br>
And <i>Orcus</i> tame, whom nothing can perswade,<br>
And rule the <i>Furyes</i>, when they most do rage:<br>
Such vertue in his staffe had eke this Palmer sage.<p>
 
Thence passing forth, they shortly do arriue,<br>
Whereas the Bowre of <i>Blisse</i> was situate;<br>
A place pickt out by choice of best aliue,<br>
That natures worke by art can imitate:<br>
In which what euer in this worldly state<br>
Is sweet, and pleasing vnto liuing sense,<br>
Or that may dayntiest fantasie aggrate,<br>
Was poured forth with plentifull dispence,<br>
And made there to abound with lauish affluence.<p>
 
Goodly it was enclosed round about,<br>
Aswell their entred guestes to keepe within,<br>
As those vnruly beasts to hold without;<br>
Yet was the fence thereof but weake and thin;<br>
Nought feard their force, that fortilage to win,<br>
But wisedomes powre, and temperaunces might,<br>
By which the mightiest things efforced bin:<br>
And eke the gate was wrought of substaunce light,<br>
Rather for pleasure, then for battery or fight.<p>
 
Yt framed was of precious yuory,<br>
That seemd a worke of admirable wit;<br>
And therein all the famous history<br>
Of <i>Iason</i> and <i>Med&aelig;a</i> was ywrit;<br>
Her mighty charmes, her furious louing fit,<br>
His goodly conquest of the golden fleece,<br>
His falsed faith, and loue too lightly flit,<br>
The wondred <i>Argo</i>, which in venturous peece<br>
First through the <i>Euxine</i> seas bore all the flowr of 
<i>Greece</i>.<p>
 
Ye might haue seene the frothy billowes fry<br>
Vnder the ship, as thorough them she went,<br>
That seemd the waues were into yuory,<br>
Or yuory into the waues were sent;<br>
And other where the snowy substaunce sprent<br>
With vermell, like the boyes bloud therein shed,<br>
A piteous spectacle did represent,<br>
And otherwhiles with gold besprinkeled;<br>
Yt seemd th'enchaunted flame, which did <i>Cre&uuml;sa</i> wed.<p>
 
All this, and more might in that goodly gate<br>
Be red; that euer open stood to all,<br>
Which thither came: but in the Porch there sate<br>
A comely personage of stature tall,<br>
And semblaunce pleasing, more then naturall,<br>
That trauellers to him seemd to entize;<br>
His looser garment to the ground did fall,<br>
And flew about his heeles in wanton wize,<br>
Not fit for speedy pace, or manly exercize.<p>
 
They in that place him <i>Genius</i> did call:<br>
Not that celestiall powre, to whom the care<br>
Of life, and generation of all<br>
That liues, pertaines in charge particulare,<br>
Who wondrous things concerning our welfare,<br>
And straunge phantomes doth let vs oft forsee,<br>
And oft of secret ill bids vs beware:<br>
That is our Selfe, whom though we do not see,<br>
Yet each doth in him selfe it well perceiue to bee.<p>
 
Therefore a God him sage Antiquity<br>
Did wisely make, and good <i>Agdistes</i> call:<br>
But this same was to that quite contrary,<br>
The foe of life, that good enuyes to all,<br>
That secretly doth vs procure to fall,<br>
Through guilefull semblaunts, which he makes vs see.<br>
He of this Gardin had the gouernall,<br>
And Pleasures porter was deuizd to bee,<br>
Holding a staffe in hand for more formalitee.<p>
 
With diuerse flowres he daintily was deckt,<br>
And strowed round about, and by his side<br>
A mighty Mazer bowle of wine was set,<br>
As if it had to him bene sacrifide;<br>
Wherewith all new-come guests he gratifide:<br>
So did he eke Sir <i>Guyon</i> passing by:<br>
But he his idle curtesie defide,<br>
And ouerthrew his bowle disdainfully;<br>
And broke his staffe, with which he charmed semblants sly.<p>
 
Thus being entred, they behold around<br>
A large and spacious plaine, on euery side<br>
Strowed with pleasauns, whose faire grassy ground<br>
Mantled with greene, and goodly beautifide<br>
With all the ornaments of <i>Floraes</i> pride,<br>
Wherewith her mother Art, as halfe in scorne<br>
Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride<br>
Did decke her, and too lauishly adorne,<br>
When forth from virgin bowre she comes in th'early morne.<p>
 
Thereto the Heauens alwayes Iouiall,<br>
Lookt on them louely, still in stedfast state,<br>
Ne suffred storme nor frost on them to fall,<br>
Their tender buds or leaues to violate,<br>
Nor scorching heat, nor cold intemperate<br>
T'afflict the creatures, which therein did dwell,<br>
But the milde air with season moderate<br>
Gently attempred, and disposd so well,<br>
That still it breathed forth sweet spirit &amp; holesome smell.<p>
 
More sweet and holesome, then the pleasaunt hill<br>
Of <i>Rhodope</i>, on which the Nimphe, that bore<br>
A gyaunt babe, her selfe for griefe did kill;<br>
Or the Thessalian <i>Tempe</i>, where of yore<br>
Faire <i>Daphne Phoebus</i> hart with loue did gore;<br>
Or <i>Ida</i>, where the Gods lou'd to repaire,<br>
When euer they their heauenly bowres forlore;<br>
Or sweet <i>Parnasse</i>, the haunt of Muses faire;<br>
Or <i>Eden</i> selfe, if ought with <i>Eden</i> mote compaire.<p>
 
Much wondred <i>Guyon</i> at the faire aspect<br>
Of that sweet place, yet suffred no delight<br>
To sincke into his sence, nor mind affect,<br>
But passed forth, and lookt still forward right,<br>
Bridling his will, and maistering his might:<br>
Till that he came vnto another gate,<br>
No gate, but like one, being goodly dight<br>
With boughes and braunches, which did broad dilate<br>
Their clasping armes, in wanton wreathings intricate.<p>
 
So fashioned a Porch with rare deuice,<br>
Archt ouer head with an embracing vine,<br>
Whose bounches hanging downe, seemed to entice<br>
All passers by, to tast their lushious wine,<br>
And did themselues into their hands incline,<br>
As freely offering to be gathered:<br>
Some deepe empurpled as the <i>Hyacint</i>,<br>
Some as the Rubine, laughing sweetly red,<br>
Some like faire Emeraudes, not yet well ripened.<p>
 
And them amongst, some were of burnisht gold,<br>
So made by art, to beautifie the rest,<br>
Which did themselues emongst the leaues enfold,<br>
As lurking from the vew of couetous guest,<br>
That the weake bowes, with so rich load opprest,<br>
Did bow adowne, as ouer-burdened.<br>
Vnder that Porch a comely dame did rest,<br>
Clad in faire weedes, but fowle disordered,<br>
And garments loose, that seemd vnmeet for womanhed.<p>
 
In her left hand a Cup of gold she held,<br>
And with her right the riper fruit did reach,<br>
Whose sappy liquor, that with fulnesse sweld,<br>
Into her cup she scruzd, with daintie breach<br>
Of her fine fingers, without fowle empeach,<br>
That so faire wine-presse made the wine more sweet:<br>
Thereof she vsd to giue to drinke to each,<br>
Whom passing by she happened to meet:<br>
It was her guise, all Straungers goodly so to greet.<p>
 
So she to <i>Guyon</i> offred it to tast;<br>
Who taking it out of her tender hond,<br>
The cup to ground did violently cast,<br>
That all in peeces it was broken fond,<br>
And with the liquor stained all the lond:<br>
Whereat <i>Excesse</i> exceedingly was wroth,<br>
Yet no'te the same amend, ne yet withstond,<br>
But suffered him to passe, all were she loth;<br>
Who nought regarding her displeasure forward goth.<p>
 
There the most daintie Paradise on ground,<br>
It selfe doth offer to his sober eye,<br>
In which all pleasures plenteously abound,<br>
And none does others happinesse enuye:<br>
The painted flowres, the trees vpshooting hye,<br>
The dales for shade, the hilles for breathing space,<br>
The trembling groues, the Christall running by;<br>
And that, which all faire workes doth most aggrace,<br>
The art, which all that wrought, appeared in no place.<p>
 
One would haue thought, (so cunningly, the rude,<br>
And scorned parts were mingled with the fine,)<br>
That nature had for wantonesse ensude<br>
Art, and that Art at nature did repine;<br>
So striuing each th'other to vndermine,<br>
Each did the others worke more beautifie;<br>
So diff'ring both in willes, agreed in fine:<br>
So all agreed through sweete diuersitie,<br>
This Gardin to adorne with all varietie.<p>
 
And in the midst of all, a fountaine stood,<br>
Of richest substaunce, that on earth might bee,<br>
So pure and shiny, that the siluer flood<br>
Through euery channell running one might see;<br>
Most goodly it with curious imageree<br>
Was ouer-wrought, and shapes of naked boyes,<br>
Of which some seemd with liuely iollitee,<br>
To fly about, playing their wanton toyes,<br>
Whilest others did them selues embay in liquid ioyes.<p>
 
And ouer all, of purest gold was spred,<br>
A trayle of yuie in his natiue hew:<br>
For the rich mettall was so coloured,<br>
That wight, who did not well auis'd it vew,<br>
Would surely deeme it to be yuie trew:<br>
Low his lasciuious armes adown did creepe,<br>
That themselues dipping in the siluer dew,<br>
Their fleecy flowres they tenderly did steepe,<br>
Which drops of Christall seemd for wantones to weepe.<p>
 
Infinit streames continually did well<br>
Out of this fountaine, sweet and faire to see,<br>
The which into an ample lauer fell,<br>
And shortly grew to so great quantitie,<br>
That like a little lake it seemd to bee;<br>
Whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,<br>
That through the waues one might the bottom see,<br>
All pau'd beneath with Iaspar shining bright,<br>
That seemd the fountaine in that sea did sayle vpright.<p>
 
And all the margent round about was set,<br>
With shady Laurell trees, thence to defend<br>
The sunny beames, which on the billowes bet,<br>
And those which therein bathed, mote offend.<br>
As <i>Guyon</i> hapned by the same to wend,<br>
Two naked Damzelles he therein espyde,<br>
Which therein bathing, seemed to contend,<br>
And wrestle wantonly, ne car'd to hyde,<br>
Their dainty parts from vew of any, which them eyde.<p>
 
Sometimes the one would lift the other quight<br>
Aboue the waters, and then downe againe<br>
Her plong, as ouer maistered by might,<br>
Where both awhile would couered remaine,<br>
And each the other from to rise restraine;<br>
The whiles their snowy limbes, as through a vele,<br>
So through the Christall waues appeared plaine:<br>
Then suddeinly both would themselues vnhele,<br>
And th'amarous sweet spoiles to greedy eyes reuele.<p>
 
As that faire Starre, the messenger of morne,<br>
His deawy face out of the sea doth reare:<br>
Or as the <i>Cyprian</i> goddesse, newly borne<br>
Of th'Oceans fruitfull froth, did first appeare:<br>
Such seemed they, and so their yellow heare<br>
Christalline humour dropped downe apace.<br>
Whom such when <i>Guyon</i> saw, he drew him neare,<br>
And somewhat gan relent his earnest pace,<br>
His stubborne brest gan secret pleasaunce to embrace.<p>
 
The wanton Maidens him espying, stood<br>
Gazing a while at his vnwonted guise;<br>
Then th'one her selfe low ducked in the flood,<br>
Abasht, that her a straunger did avise:<br>
But th'other rather higher did arise,<br>
And her two lilly paps aloft displayd,<br>
And all, that might his melting hart entise<br>
To her delights, she vnto him bewrayd:<br>
The rest hid vnderneath, him more desirous made.<p>
 
With that, the other likewise vp arose,<br>
And her faire lockes, which formerly were bownd<br>
Vp in one knot, he low adowne did lose:<br>
Which flowing long and thick, her cloth'd arownd,<br>
And th'yuorie in golden mantle gownd:<br>
So that faire spectacle from him was reft,<br>
Yet that, which reft it, no lesse faire was fownd:<br>
So hid in lockes and waues from lookers theft,<br>
Nought but her louely face she for his looking left.<p>
 
Withall she laughed, and she blusht withall,<br>
That blushing to her laughter gaue more grace,<br>
And laughter to her blushing, as did fall:<br>
Now when they spide the knight to slacke his pace,<br>
Them to behold, and in his sparkling face<br>
The secret signes of kindled lust appeare,<br>
Their wanton meriments they did encreace,<br>
And to him beckned, to approch more neare,<br>
And shewd him many sights, that courage cold could reare.<p>
 
On which when gazing him the Palmer saw,<br>
He much rebukt those wandring eyes of his,<br>
And counseld well, him forward thence did draw.<br>
Now are they come nigh to the <i>Bowre of blis</i><br>
Of her fond fauorites so nam'd amis:<br>
When thus the Palmer; Now Sir, well auise;<br>
For here the end of all our trauell is:<br>
Here wonnes <i>Acrasia</i>, whom we must surprise,<br>
Else she will slip away, and all our drift despise.<p>
 
Etfsoones they heard a most melodious sound,<br>
Of all that mote delight a daintie eare,<br>
Such as attonce might not on liuing ground,<br>
Saue in this Paradise, be heard elswhere:<br>
Right hard it was, for wight, which did it heare,<br>
To read, what manner musicke that mote bee:<br>
For all that pleasing is to liuing eare,<br>
Was there consorted in one harmonee,<br>
Birdes, voyces, instruments, windes, waters, all agree.<p>
 
The ioyous birdes shrouded in chearefull shade,<br>
Their notes vnto the voyce attempred sweet;<br>
Th'Angelicall soft trembling voyces made<br>
To th'instruments diuine respondence meet:<br>
The siluer sounding instruments did meet<br>
With the base murmure of the waters fall:<br>
The waters fall with difference discreet,<br>
Now soft, now loud, vnto the wind did call:<br>
The gentle warbling wind low answered to all.<p>
 
There, whence that Musick seemed heard to bee,<br>
Was the faire Witch her selfe now solacing,<br>
With a new Louer, whom through sorceree<br>
And witchcraft, she from farre did thither bring:<br>
There she had him now layd a slombering,<br>
In secret shade, after long wanton ioyes:<br>
Whilst round about them pleasauntly did sing<br>
Many faire Ladies, and lasciuious boyes,<br>
That euer mixt their song with light licentious toyes.<p>
 
And all that while, right ouer him she hong,<br>
With her false eyes fast fixed in his sight,<br>
As seeking medicine, whence she was stong,<br>
Or greedily depasturing delight:<br>
And oft inclining downe with kisses light,<br>
For feare of waking him, his lips bedewd,<br>
And through his humid eyes did sucke his spright,<br>
Quite molten into lust and pleasure lewd;<br>
Wherewith she sighed soft, as if his case she rewd.<p>
 
The whiles some one did chaunt this louely lay;<br>
Ah see, who so faire thing doest faine to see,<br>
In springing flowre the image of thy day;<br>
Ah see the Virgin Rose, how sweetly shee<br>
Doth first peepe forth with bashfull modestee,<br>
That fairer seemes, the lesse ye see her may;<br>
Lo see soone after, how more bold and free<br>
Her bared bosome she doth broad display;<br>
Loe see soone after, how she fades, and falles away.<p>
 
So passeth, in the passing of a day,<br>
Of mortall life the leafe, the bud, the flowre,<br>
Ne more doth flourish after first decay,<br>
That earst was sought to decke both bed and bowre,<br>
Of many a Ladie, and many a Paramowre:<br>
Gather therefore the Rose, whilest yet is prime,<br>
For soone comes age, that will her pride deflowre:<br>
Gather the Rose of love, whilest yet is time,<br>
Whilest louing thou mayst loued be with equall crime.<p>
 
He ceast, and then gan all the quire of birdes<br>
Their diuerse notes t'attune vnto his lay,<br>
As in approuance of his pleasing words.<br>
The constant paire heard all, that he did say,<br>
Yet swarued not, but kept their forward way,<br>
Through many couert groues, and thickets close,<br>
In which they creeping did at last display<br>
That wanton Ladie, with her louer lose,<br>
Whose sleepie head she in her lap did soft dispose.<p>
 
Vpon a bed of Roses she was layd,<br>
As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin,<br>
And was arayd, or rather disarayd,<br>
All in a vele of silke and siluer thin,<br>
That hid no whit her alablaster skin,<br>
But rather shewd more white, if more might bee:<br>
More subtile web <i>Arachne</i> can not spin,<br>
Nor the fine nets, which oft we wouen see<br>
Of scorched deaw, do not in th'aire more lightly flee.<p>
 
Her snowy brest was bare to readie spoyle<br>
Of hungry eies, which n'ote therewith be fild,<br>
And yet through languour of her late sweet toyle,<br>
Few drops, more cleare then Nectar, forth distild,<br>
That like pure Orient perles adowne it trild,<br>
And her faire eyes sweet smyling in delight,<br>
Moystened their fierie beames, with which she thrild<br>
Fraile harts, yet quenched not; like starry light<br>
Which sparckling on the silent waues, does seeme more bright.<p>
 
The young man sleeping by her, seemd to bee<br>
Some goodly swayne of honorable place,<br>
That certes it great pittie was to see<br>
Him his nobilitie so foule deface;<br>
A sweet regard, and amiable grace,<br>
Mixed with manly sternnesse did appeare<br>
Yet sleeping, in his well proportiond face,<br>
And on his tender lips the downy heare<br>
Did now but freshly spring, and silken blossomes beare.<p>
 
His warlike armes, the idle instruments<br>
Of sleeping praise, were hong vpon a tree,<br>
And his braue shield, full of old moniments,<br>
Was fowly ra'st, that none the signes might see;<br>
Ne for them, ne for honour cared hee,<br>
Ne ought, that did to his aduauncement tend,<br>
But in lewd loues, and wastfull luxuree,<br>
His dayes, his goods, his bodie he did spend:<br>
O horrible enchantment, that him so did blend.<p>
 
The noble Elfe, and carefull Palmer drew<br>
So nigh them, minding nought, but lustfull game,<br>
That suddein forth they on them rusht, and threw<br>
A subtile net, which onely for the same<br>
The skilfull Palmer formally did frame.<br>
So held them vnder fast, the whiles the rest<br>
Fled all away for feare of fowler shame.<br>
The faire Enchauntresse, so vnwares opprest,<br>
Tryde all her arts, &amp; all her sleights, thence out to wrest.<p>
 
And eke her louer stroue: but all in vaine;<br>
For that same net so cunningly was wound,<br>
That neither guile, nor force might it distraine.<br>
They tooke them both, &amp; both them strongly bound<br>
In captiue bandes, which there they readie found:<br>
But her in chaines of adamant he tyde;<br>
For nothing else might keepe her safe and sound;<br>
But <i>Verdant</i> (so he hight) he soone vntyde,<br>
And counsell sage in steed thereof to him applyde.<p>
 
But all those pleasant bowres and Pallace braue,<br>
<i>Guyon</i> broke downe, with rigour pittilesse;<br>
Ne ought their goodly workmanship might saue<br>
Them from the tempest of his wrathfulnesse,<br>
But that their blisse he turn'd to balefulnesse:<br>
Their groues he feld, their gardins did deface,<br>
Their arbers spoyle, their Cabinets suppresse,<br>
Their banket houses burne, their buildings race,<br>
And of the fairest late, now made the fowlest place.<p>
 
Then led they her away, and eke that knight<br>
They with them led, both sorrowfull and sad:<br>
The way they came, the same retourn'd they right,<br>
Till they arriued, where they lately had<br>
Charm'd those wild-beasts, that rag'd with furie mad.<br>
Which now awaking, fierce at them gan fly,<br>
As in their mistresse reskew, whom they lad;<br>
But them the Palmer soone did pacify.<br>
Then <i>Guyon</i> askt, what meant those beastes, which there did 
ly.<p>
 
Said he, These seeming beasts are men indeed,<br>
Whom this Enchauntresse hath transformed thus,<br>
Whylome her louers, which her lusts did feed,<br>
Now turned into figures hideous,<br>
According to their mindes like monstruous.<br>
Sad end (quoth he) of life intemperate,<br>
And mournefull meed of ioyes delicious:<br>
But Palmer, if it mote thee so aggrate,<br>
Let them returned be vnto their former state.<p>
 
Streight way he with his vertuous staffe them strooke,<br>        
And streight of beasts they comely men became;<br>
Yet being men they did vnmanly looke,<br>
And stared ghastly, some for inward shame,<br>
And some for wrath, to see their captiue Dame:<br>
But one aboue the rest in speciall,<br>
That had an hog beene late, hight <i>Grille</i> by name,<br>
Repined greatly, and did him miscall,<br>
That had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall.<p>
 
Said <i>Guyon</i>, See the mind of beastly man,<br>
That hath so soone forgot the excellence<br>
Of his creation, when he life began,<br>
That now he chooseth, with vile difference,<br>
To be a beast, and lacke intelligence.<br>
To whom the Palmer thus, The donghill kind<br>
Delights in filth and foule incontinence:<br>
Let <i>Grill</i> be <i>Grill</i>, and haue his hoggish mind,<br>
But let vs hence depart, whilest wether serues and wind.<p>
