*Cant. IIII.*

> *Satyrane makes a Turneyment  
> For loue of Florimell:  
> Britomart winnes the prize from all,  
> And Artegall doth quell.*

> I T often fals, (as here it earst befell)  
> That mortall foes doe turne to faithfull frends,  
> And friends profest are chaungd to foemen fell:  
> The cause of both, of both their minds depends;  
> And th'end of both likewise of both their ends.  
> For enmitie, that of no ill proceeds,  
> But of occasion, with th'occasion ends;  
> And friendship, which a faint affection breeds  
> Without regard of good, dyes like ill grounded seeds.
>
> That well (me seemes) appeares, by that of late  
> Twixt *Cambell* and Sir *Triamond* befell,  
> As als by this, that now a new debate  
> Stird vp twixt *Scudamour* and *Paridell*,  
> The which by course befals me here to tell:  
> Who hauing those two other Knights espide,  
> Marching afore, as ye remember well,  
> Sent forth their Squire to haue them both descride,  
> And eke those masked Ladies riding them beside.
>
> Who backe returning, told as he had seene,  
> That they were doughtie knights of dreaded name;  
> And those two Ladies, their two loues vnseene;  
> And therefore wisht them without blot or blame,  
> To let them passe at will, for dread of shame.  
> But *Blandamour* full of vainglorious spright,  
> And rather stird by his discordfull Dame,  
> Vpon them gladly would haue prov'd his might,  
> But that he yet was sore of his late lucklesse fight.
>
> Yet nigh approching, he them fowle bespake,  
> Disgracing them, him selfe thereby to grace,  
> As was his wont; so weening way to make  
> To Ladies loue, where so he came in place,  
> And with lewd termes their louers to deface.  
> Whose sharpe prouokement them incenst so sore,  
> That both were bent t'auenge his vsage base,  
> And gan their shields addresse them selues afore:  
> For euill deedes may better then bad words be bore.
>
> But faire *Cambina* with perswasions myld,  
> Did mitigate the fiercenesse of their mode,  
> That for the present they were reconcyld,  
> And gan to treate of deeds of armes abrode,  
> And strange aduentures, all the way they rode:  
> Amongst the which they told, as then befell,  
> Of that great turney, which was blazed brode,  
> For that rich girdle of faire *Florimell*,  
> The prize of her, which did in beautie most excell.
>
> To which folke-mote they all with one consent,  
> Sith each of them his Ladie had him by,  
> Whose beautie each of them thought excellent,  
> Agreed to trauell, and their fortunes try.  
> So as they passed forth, they did espy  
> One in bright armes, with ready speare in rest,  
> That toward them his course seem'd to apply,  
> Gainst whom Sir *Paridell* himselfe addrest,  
> Him weening, ere he nigh approcht to haue represt.
>
> Which th'other seeing, gan his course relent,  
> And vaunted speare eftsoones to disaduaunce,  
> As if he naught but peace and pleasure ment,  
> Now falne into their fellowship by chance,  
> Whereat they shewed curteous countenaunce.  
> So as he rode with them accompanide,  
> His rouing eie did on the Lady glaunce,  
> Which *Blandamour* had riding by his side:  
> Who˜ sure he weend, that he some wher tofore had eide.
>
> It was to weete that snowy *Florimell*,  
> Which *Ferrau* late from *Braggadochio* wonne,  
> Whom he now seeing, her remembred well,  
> How hauing reft her from the witches sonne,  
> He soone her lost: wherefore he now begunne  
> To challenge her anew, as his owne prize,  
> Whom formerly he had in battell wonne,  
> And proffer made by force her to reprize:  
> Which scornefull offer, *Blandamour* gan soone despize.
>
> And said, Sir Knight, sith ye this Lady clame,  
> Whom he that hath, were loth to lose so light,  
> (For so to lose a Lady, were great shame)  
> Yee shall her winne, as I haue done in fight:  
> And lo shee shall be placed here in sight,  
> Together with this Hag beside her set,  
> That who so winnes her, may her haue by right:  
> But he shall haue the Hag that is ybet,  
> And with her alwaies ride, till he another get.
>
> That offer pleased all the company,  
> So *Florimell* with *Ate* forth was brought,  
> At which they all gan laugh full merrily:  
> But *Braggadochio* said, he neuer thought  
> For such an Hag, that seemed worse then nought,  
> His person to emperill so in fight.  
> But if to match that Lady they had sought  
> Another like, that were like faire and bright,  
> His life he then would spend to iustifie his right.
>
> At which his vaine excuse they all gan smile,  
> As scorning his vnmanly cowardize:  
> And *Florimell* him fowly gan reuile,  
> That for her sake refus'd to enterprize  
> The battell, offred in so knightly wize.  
> And *Ate* eke prouokt him priuily,  
> With loue of her, and shame of such mesprize.  
> But naught he car'd for friend or enemy,  
> For in base mind nor friendship dwels nor enmity.
>
> But *Cambell* thus did shut vp all in iest,  
> Braue Knights and Ladies, certes ye doe wrong  
> To stirre vp strife, when most vs needeth rest,  
> That we may vs reserue both fresh and strong,  
> Against the Turneiment which is not long.  
> When who so list to fight, may fight his fill,  
> Till then your challenges ye may prolong;  
> And then it shall be tried, if ye will,  
> Whether shall haue the Hag, or hold the Lady still.
>
> They all agreed: so turning all to game,  
> And pleasaunt bord, they past forth on their way,  
> And all that while, where so they rode or came,  
> That masked Mock-knight was their sport and play.  
> Till that at length vpon th'appointed day,  
> Vnto the place of turneyment they came;  
> Where they before them found in fresh aray  
> Manie a braue knight, and manie a daintie dame  
> Assembled, for to get the honour of that game.
>
> There this faire crewe arriuing, did diuide  
> Them selues asunder: *Blandamour* with those  
> Of his, on th'one; the rest on th'other side.  
> But boastfull *Braggadocchio* rather chose,  
> For glorie vaine their fellowship to lose,  
> That men on him the more might gaze alone.  
> The rest them selues in troupes did else dispose,  
> Like as it seemed best to euery one;  
> The knights in couples marcht, with ladies linckt attone.
>
> Then first of all forth came Sir *Satyrane*,  
> Bearing that precious relicke in an arke  
> Of gold, that bad eyes might it not prophane:  
> Which drawing softly forth out of the darke,  
> He open shewd, that all men it mote marke.  
> A gorgeous girdle, curiously embost  
> With pearle & precious stone, worth many a marke;  
> Yet did the workmanship farre passe the cost:  
> It was the same, which lately *Florimel* had lost.
>
> That same aloft he hong in open vew,  
> To be the prize of beautie and of might;  
> The which eftsoones discouered, to it drew  
> The eyes of all, allur'd with close delight,  
> And hearts quite robbed with so glorious sight,  
> That all men threw out vowes and wishes vaine.  
> Thrise happie Ladie, and thrise happie knight,  
> Them seemd, that could so goodly riches gaine,  
> So worthie of the perill, worthy of the paine.
>
> Then tooke the bold Sir *Satyrane* in hand  
> An huge great speare, such as he wont to wield,  
> And vauncing forth from all the other band  
> Of knights, addrest his maiden-headed shield,  
> Shewing him selfe all ready for the field.  
> Gainst whom there singled from the other side  
> A Painim knight, that well in armes was skild,  
> And had in many a battell oft bene tride,  
> Hight *Bruncheual* the bold, who fiersly forth did ride.
>
> So furiously they both together met,  
> That neither could the others force sustaine;  
> As two fierce Buls, that striue the rule to get  
> Of all the heard, meete with so hideous maine,  
> That both rebutted, tumble on the plaine:  
> So these two champions to the ground were feld,  
> Where in a maze they both did long remaine,  
> And in their hands their idle troncheons held,  
> Which neither able were to wag, or once to weld.
>
> Which when the noble *Ferramont* espide,  
> He pricked forth in ayd of *Satyran*;  
> And him against Sir *Blandamour* did ride  
> With all the strength and stifnesse that he can.  
> But the more strong and stiffely that he ran,  
> So much more sorely to the ground he fell,  
> That on an heape were tumbled horse and man.  
> Vnto whose rescue forth rode *Paridell*;  
> But him likewise with that same speare he eke did quell.
>
> Which *Braggadocchio* seeing, had no will  
> To hasten greatly to his parties ayd,  
> Albee his turne were next; but stood there still,  
> As one that seemed doubtfull or dismayd.  
> But *Triamond* halfe wroth to see him staid,  
> Sternly stept forth, and raught away his speare,  
> With which so sore he *Ferramont* assaid,  
> That horse and man to ground he quite did beare,  
> That neither could in hast themselues againe vpreare.
>
> Which to auenge, Sir *Deuon* him did dight,  
> But with no better fortune then the rest:  
> For him likewise he quickly downe did smight,  
> And after him Sir *Douglas* him addrest,  
> And after him Sir *Paliumord* forth prest,  
> But none of them against his strokes could stand,  
> But all the more, the more his praise increst.  
> For either they were left vppon the land,  
> Or went away sore wounded of his haplesse hand.
>
> And now by this, Sir *Satyrane* abraid,  
> Out of the swowne, in which too long he lay;  
> And looking round about, like one dismaid,  
> When as he saw the mercilesse affray  
> Which doughty *Triamond* had wrought that day,  
> Vnto the noble Knights of Maidenhead,  
> His mighty heart did almost rend in tway,  
> For very gall, that rather wholly dead  
> Himselfe he wisht haue beene, then in so bad a stead.
>
> Eftsoones he gan to gather vp around  
> His weapons, which lay scattered all abrode,  
> And as it fell, his steed he ready found.  
> On whom remounting, fiercely forth he rode,  
> Like sparke of fire that from the anduile glode.  
> There where he saw the valiant *Triamond*  
> Chasing, and laying on them heauy lode,  
> That none his force were able to withstond,  
> So dreadfull were his strokes, so deadly was his hond.
>
> With that, at him his beam-like speare he aimed,  
> And thereto all his power and might applide:  
> The wicked steele for mischiefe first ordained,  
> And hauing now misfortune got for guide,  
> Staid not, till it arriued in his side.  
> And therein made a very griesly wound,  
> That streames of bloud his armour all bedide.  
> Much was he daunted with that direfull stound,  
> That scarse he him vpheld from falling in a sound.
>
> Yet as he might, himselfe he soft withdrew  
> Out of the field, that none perceiu'd it plaine.  
> Then gan the part of Chalengers anew  
> To range the field, and victorlike to raine,  
> That none against them battell durst maintaine.  
> By that the gloomy euening on them fell,  
> That forced them from fighting to refraine,  
> And trumpets sound to cease did them compell.  
> So *Satyrane* that day was iudg'd to beare the bell.
>
> The morrow next the Turney gan anew,  
> And with the first the hardy *Satyrane*  
> Appear'd in place, with all his noble crew:  
> On th'other side, full many a warlike swaine,  
> Assembled were, that glorious prize to gaine.  
> But mongst them all, was not Sir *Triamond*,  
> Vnable he new battell to darraine,  
> Through grieuaunce of his late receiued wound,  
> That doubly did him grieue, when so himselfe he found.
>
> Which *Cambell* seeing, though he could not salue,  
> Ne done vndoe, yet for to salue his name,  
> And purchase honour in his friends behalue,  
> This goodly counterfesaunce he did frame.  
> The shield and armes well knowne to be the same,  
> Which *Triamond* had worne, vnwares to wight,  
> And to his friend vnwist, for doubt of blame,  
> If he misdid, he on himselfe did dight,  
> That none could him discerne, and so went forth to fight.
>
> There *Satyrane* Lord of the field he found,  
> Triumphing in great ioy and iolity;  
> Gainst whom none able was to stand on ground;  
> That much he gan his glorie to enuy,  
> And cast t'auenge his friends indignity.  
> A mightie speare eftsoones at him he bent;  
> Who seeing him come on so furiously,  
> Met him mid-way with equall hardiment,  
> That forcibly to ground they both together went.
>
> They vp againe them selues can lightly reare,  
> And to their tryed swords them selues betake;  
> With which they wrought such wondrous maruels there,  
> That all the rest it did amazed make,  
> Ne any dar'd their perill to partake;  
> Now cuffling close, now chacing to and fro,  
> Now hurtling round aduantage for to take:  
> As two wild Boares together grapling go,  
> Chaufing and foming choler each against his fo.
>
> So as they courst, and turneyd here and theare,  
> It chaunst Sir *Satyrane* his steed at last,  
> Whether through foundring or through sodein feare  
> To stumble, that his rider nigh he cast;  
> Which vauntage *Cambell* did pursue so fast,  
> That ere him selfe he had recouered well,  
> So sore he sowst him on the compast creast,  
> That forced him to leaue his loftie sell,  
> And rudely tumbling downe vnder his horse feete fell.
>
> Lightly *Cambello* leapt downe from his steed,  
> For to haue rent his shield and armes away,  
> That whylome wont to be the victors meed;  
> When all vnwares he felt an hideous sway  
> Of many swords, that lode on him did lay.  
> An hundred knights had him enclosed round,  
> To rescue *Satyrane* out of his pray;  
> All which at once huge strokes on him did pound,  
> In hope to take him prisoner, where he stood on ground.
>
> He with their multitude was nought dismayd,  
> But with stout courage turnd vpon them all,  
> And with his brondiron round about him layd;  
> Of which he dealt large almes, as did befall:  
> Like as a Lion that by chaunce doth fall  
> Into the hunters toile, doth rage and rore,  
> In royall heart disdaining to be thrall.  
> But all in vaine: for what might one do more?  
> They haue him taken captiue, though it grieue him sore.
>
> Whereof when newes to *Triamond* was brought,  
> There as he lay, his wound he soone forgot,  
> And starting vp, streight for his armour sought:  
> In vaine he sought; for there he found it not;  
> *Cambello* it away before had got:  
> *Cambelloes* armes therefore he on him threw,  
> And lightly issewd forth to take his lot.  
> There he in troupe found all that warlike crew,  
> Leading his friend away, full sorie to his vew.
>
> Into the thickest of that knightly preasse  
> He thrust, and smote downe all that was betweene,  
> Caried with feruent zeale, ne did he ceasse,  
> Till that he came, where he had *Cambell* seene,  
> Like captive thral two other Knights atweene,  
> There he amongst them cruell hauocke makes;  
> That they which lead him, soone enforced beene  
> To let him loose, to saue their proper stakes;  
> Who being freed, from one a weapon fiercely takes.
>
> With that he driues at them with dreadfull might,  
> Both in remembrance of his friends late harme,  
> And in reuengement of his owne despight,  
> So both together giue a new allarme,  
> As if but now the battell wexed warme.  
> As when two greedy Wolues doe breake by force  
> Into an heard, farre from the husband farme,  
> They spoile and rauine without all remorse,  
> So did these two through all the field their foes enforce.
>
> Fiercely they followd on their bolde emprize,  
> Till trumpets sound did warne them all to rest;  
> Then all with one consent did yeeld the prize  
> To *Triamond* and *Cambell* as the best.  
> But *Triamond* to *Cambell* it relest,  
> And *Cambell* it to *Triamond* transferd;  
> Each labouring t'aduance the others gest,  
> And make his praise before his owne preferd:  
> So that the doome was to another day differd.
>
> The last day came, when all those knightes againe  
> Assembled were their deedes of armes to shew.  
> Full many deedes that day were shewed plaine:  
> But *Satyrane* boue all the other crew,  
> His wondrous worth declared in all mens view.  
> For from the first he to the last endured,  
> And though some while Fortune from him withdrew,  
> Yet euermore his honour he recured,  
> And with vnwearied powre his party still assured.
>
> Ne was there Knight that euer thought of armes,  
> But that his vtmost prowesse there made knowen,  
> That by their many wounds, and carelesse harmes,  
> By shiuered speares, and swords all vnder strowen,  
> By scattered shields was easie to be showen.  
> There might ye see loose steeds at randon ronne,  
> Whose luckelesse riders late were ouerthrowen;  
> And squiers make hast to helpe their Lords fordonne.  
> But still the Knights of Maidenhead the better wonne.
>
> Till that there entred on the other side,  
> A straunger knight, from whence no man could reed,  
> In quyent disguise, full hard to be descride.  
> For all his armour was like saluage weed,  
> With woody mosse bedight, and all his steed  
> With oaken leaues attrapt, that seemed fit  
> For saluage wight, and thereto well agreed  
> His word, which on his ragged shield was writ,  
> *Saluagesse sans finesse*, shewing secret wit.
>
> He at his first incomming, charg'd his spere  
> At him, that first appeared in his sight:  
> That was to weet, the stout Sir *Sangliere*,  
> Who well was knowen to be a valiant Knight,  
> Approued oft in many a perlous fight.  
> Him at the first encounter downe he smote,  
> And ouerbore beyond his crouper quight,  
> And after him another Knight, that hote  
> Sir *Brianor*, so sore, that none him life behote.
>
> Then ere his hand he reard, he ouerthrew  
> Seuen Knights one after other as they came:  
> And when his speare was brust, his sword he drew,  
> The instrument of wrath, and with the same  
> Far'd like a lyon in his bloodie game,  
> Hewing, and slashing shields, and helmets bright,  
> And beating downe, what euer nigh him came,  
> That euery one gan shun his dreadfull sight,  
> No lesse then death it selfe, in daungerous affright.
>
> Much wondred all men, what, or whence he came,  
> That did amongst the troupes so tyrannize;  
> And each of other gan inquire his name.  
> But when they could not learne it by no wize,  
> Most answerable to his wyld disguize  
> It seemed, him to terme the saluage knight.  
> But certes his right name was otherwize,  
> Though knowne to few, that *Arthegall* he hight,  
> The doughtiest knight that liv'd that day, and most of might.
>
> Thus was Sir *Satyrane* with all his band  
> By his sole manhood and atchieuement stout  
> Dismayd, that none of them in field durst stand,  
> But beaten were, and chased all about.  
> So he continued all that day throughout,  
> Till euening, that the Sunne gan downward bend.  
> Then rushed forth out of the thickest rout  
> A stranger knight, that did his glorie shend:  
> So nought may be esteemed happie till the end.
>
> He at his entrance charg'd his powrefull speare  
> At *Artegall*, in middest of his pryde,  
> And therewith smote him on his Vmbriere  
> So sore, that tombling backe, he downe did slyde  
> Ouer his horses taile aboue a stryde:  
> Whence litle lust he had to rise againe.  
> Which *Cambell* seeing, much the same enuyde,  
> And ran at him with all his might and maine;  
> But shortly was likewise seene lying on the plaine.
>
> Whereat full inly wroth was *Triamond*,  
> And cast t'auenge the shame doen to his freend:  
> But by his friend himselfe eke soone he fond,  
> In no lesse neede of helpe, then him he weend.  
> All which when *Blandamour* from end to end  
> Beheld, he woxe therewith displeased sore,  
> And thought in mind it shortly to amend:  
> His speare he feutred, and at him it bore;  
> But with no better fortune, then the rest afore.
>
> Full many others at him likewise ran:  
> But all of them likewise dismounted were,  
> Ne certes wonder; for no powre of man  
> Could bide the force of that enchaunted speare,  
> The which this famous *Britomart* did beare;  
> With which she wondrous deeds of arms atchieued,  
> And ouerthrew, what euer came her neare,  
> That all those stranger knights full sore agrieued,  
> And that late weaker band of chalengers relieued.
>
> Like as in sommers day when raging heat  
> Doth burne the earth, and boyled riuers drie,  
> That all brute beasts forst to refraine fro meat,  
> Doe hunt for shade, where shrowded they may lie,  
> And missing it, faine from themselues to flie;  
> All trauellers tormented are with paine:  
> A watry cloud doth ouercast the skie,  
> And poureth forth a sudden shoure of raine,  
> That all the wretched world recomforteth againe.
>
> So did the warlike *Britomart* restore  
> The prize, to knights of Maydenhead that day,  
> Which else was like to haue bene lost, and bore  
> The prayse of prowesse from them all away.  
> Then shrilling trompets loudly gan to bray,  
> And bad them leaue their labours and long toyle,  
> To ioyous feast and other gentle play;  
> Where beauties prize shold win that pretious spoyle:  
> Where I with sound of trompe will also rest a whyle.
