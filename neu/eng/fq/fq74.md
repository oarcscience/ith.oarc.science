*Cant. IX.*

> *Calidore hostes with Meliboe  
> and loues fayre Pastorell;  
> Coridon enuies him, yet he  
> for ill rewards him well.*

> N Ow turne againe my teme thou iolly swayne,  
> Backe to the furrow which I lately left;  
> I lately left a furrow, one or twayne  
> Vnplough'd, the which my coulter hath not cleft:  
> Yet seem'd the soyle both fayre and frutefull eft,  
> As I it past, that were too great a shame,  
> That so rich frute should be from vs bereft;  
> Besides the great dishonour and defame,  
> Which should befall to *Calidores* immortall name.
>
> Great trauell hath the gentle *Calidore*  
> And toyle endured, sith I left him last  
> Sewing the *Blatant beast*, which I forbore  
> To finish then, for other present hast.  
> Full many pathes and perils he hath past,  
> Through hils, through dales, throgh forests, & throgh plaines  
> In that same quest which Fortune on him cast,  
> Which he atchieued to his owne great gaines,  
> Reaping eternall glorie of his restlesse paines.
>
> So sharply he the Monster did pursew,  
> That day nor night he suffred him to rest,  
> Ne rested he himselfe but natures dew,  
> For dread of daunger, not to be redrest,  
> If he for slouth forslackt so famous quest.  
> Him first from court he to the citties coursed,  
> And from the citties to the townes him prest,  
> And from the townes into the countrie forsed,  
> And from the country back to priuate farmes he scorsed.
>
> From thence into the open fields he fled,  
> Whereas the Heardes were keeping of their neat,  
> And shepheards singing to their flockes, that fed,  
> Layes of sweete loue and youthes delightfull heat:  
> Him thether eke for all his fearefull threat  
> He followed fast, and chaced him so nie,  
> That to the folds, where sheepe at night doe seat,  
> And to the litle cots, where shepherds lie  
> In winters wrathfull time, he forced him to flie.
>
> There on a day as he pursew'd the chace,  
> He chaunst to spy a sort of shepheard groomes,  
> Playing on pypes, and caroling apace,  
> The whyles their beasts there in the budded broomes  
> Beside them fed, and nipt the tender bloomes:  
> For other worldly wealth they cared nought.  
> To whom Sir *Calidore* yet sweating comes,  
> And them to tell him courteously besought,  
> If such a beast they saw, which he had thether brought.
>
> They answer'd him, that no such beast they saw,  
> Nor any wicked feend, that mote offend  
> Their happie flockes, nor daunger to them draw:  
> But if that such there were (as none they kend)  
> They prayd high God him farre from them to send.  
> Then one of them him seeing so to sweat,  
> After his rusticke wise, that well he weend,  
> Offred him drinke, to quench his thirstie heat,  
> And if he hungry were, him offred eke to eat.
>
> The knight was nothing nice, where was no need,  
> And tooke their gentle offer: so adowne  
> They prayd him sit, and gaue him for to feed  
> Such homely what, as serues the simple clowne,  
> That doth despise the dainties of the towne.  
> Tho hauing fed his fill, he there besyde  
> Saw a faire damzell, which did weare a crowne  
> Of sundry flowres, with silken ribbands tyde,  
> Yclad in home-made greene that her owne hands had dyde.
>
> Vpon a litle hillocke she was placed  
> Higher then all the rest, and round about  
> Enuiron'd with a girland, goodly graced,  
> Of louely lasses, and them all without  
> The lustie shepheard swaynes sate in a rout,  
> The which did pype and sing her prayses dew,  
> And oft reioyce, and oft for wonder shout,  
> As if some miracle of heauenly hew  
> Were downe to them descended in that earthly vew.
>
> And soothly sure she was full fayre of face,  
> And perfectly well shapt in euery lim,  
> Which she did more augment with modest grace,  
> And comely carriage of her count'nance trim,  
> That all the rest like lesser lamps did dim:  
> Who her admiring as some heauenly wight,  
> Did for their soueraine goddesse her esteeme,  
> And caroling her name both day and night,  
> The fayrest *Pastorella* her by name did hight.
>
> Ne was there heard, ne was there shepheards swayne  
> But her did honour, and eke many a one  
> Burnt in her loue, and with sweet pleasing payne  
> Full many a night for her did sigh and grone:  
> But most of all the shepheard *Coridon*  
> For her did languish, and his deare life spend;  
> Yet neither she for him, nor other none  
> Did care a whit, ne any liking lend:  
> Though meane her lot, yet higher did her mind ascend.
>
> Her whyles Sir *Calidore* there vewed well,  
> And markt her rare demeanure, which him seemed  
> So farre the meane of shepheards to excell,  
> As that he in his mind her worthy deemed,  
> To be a Princes Paragone esteemed,  
> He was vnwares surprisd in subtile bands  
> Of the blynd boy, ne thence could be redeemed  
> By any skill out of his cruell hands;  
> Caught like the bird, which gazing still on others stands.
>
> So stood he still long gazing thereupon,  
> Ne any will had thence to moue away,  
> Although his quest were farre afore him gon;  
> But after he had fed, yet did he stay,  
> And sate there still, vntill the flying day  
> Was farre forth spent, discoursing diuersly  
> Of sundry things, as fell, to worke delay;  
> And euermore his speach he did apply  
> To th'heards, but meant them to the damzels fantazy.
>
> By this the moystie night approching fast,  
> Her deawy humour gan on th'earth to shed,  
> That warn'd the shepheards to their homes to hast  
> Their tender flocks, now being fully fed,  
> For feare of wetting them before their bed;  
> Then came to them a good old aged syre,  
> Whose siluer lockes bedeckt his beard and hed,  
> With shepheards hooke in hand, and fit attyre,  
> That wild the damzell rise; the day did now expyre.
>
> He was to weet by common voice esteemed  
> The father of the fayrest *Pastorell*,  
> And of her selfe in very deede so deemed;  
> Yet was not so, but as old stories tell  
> Found her by fortune, which to him befell,  
> In th'open fields an Infant left alone,  
> And taking vp brought home, and noursed well  
> As his owne chyld; for other he had none,  
> That she in tract of time accompted was his owne.
>
> She at his bidding meekely did arise,  
> And streight vnto her litle flocke did fare:  
> Then all the rest about her rose likewise,  
> And each his sundrie sheepe with seuerall care  
> Gathered together, and them homeward bare:  
> Whylest euerie one with helping hands did striue  
> Amongst themselues, and did their labours share,  
> To helpe faire *Pastorella*, home to driue  
> Her fleecie flocke; but *Coridon* most helpe did giue.
>
> But *Meliboee* (so hight that good old man)  
> Now seeing *Calidore* left all alone,  
> And night arriued hard at hand, began  
> Him to inuite vnto his simple home;  
> Which though it were a cottage clad with lome,  
> And all things therein meane, yet better so  
> To lodge, then in the saluage fields to rome.  
> The knight full gladly soone agreed thereto,  
> Being his harts owne wish, and home with him did go.
>
> There he was welcom'd of that honest syre,  
> And of his aged Beldame homely well;  
> Who him besought himselfe to disattyre,  
> And rest himselfe, till supper time befell.  
> By which home came the fayrest *Pastorell*,  
> After her flocke she in their fold had tyde,  
> And supper readie dight, they to it fell  
> With small adoe, and nature satisfyde,  
> The which doth litle craue contented to abyde.
>
> Tho when they had their hunger slaked well,  
> And the fayre mayd the table ta'ne away,  
> The gentle knight, as he that did excell  
> In courtesie, and well could doe and say,  
> For so great kindnesse as he found that day,  
> Gan greatly thanke his host and his good wife;  
> And drawing thence his speach another way,  
> Gan highly to commend the happie life,  
> Which Shepheards lead, without debate or bitter strife.
>
> How much (sayd he) more happie is the state,  
> In which ye father here doe dwell at ease,  
> Leading a life so free and fortunate,  
> From all the tempests of these worldly seas,  
> Which tosse the rest in daungerous disease?  
> Where warres, and wreckes, and wicked enmitie  
> Doe them afflict, which no man can appease,  
> That certes I your happinesse enuie,  
> And wish my lot were plast in such felicitie.
>
> Surely my sonne (then answer'd he againe)  
> If happie, then it is in this intent,  
> That hauing small, yet doe I not complaine  
> Of want, ne wish for more it to augment,  
> But doe my self, with that I haue, content;  
> So taught of nature, which doth litle need  
> Of forreine helpes to lifes due nourishment:  
> The fields my food, my flocke my rayment breed;  
> No better doe I weare, no better doe I feed.
>
> Therefore I doe not any one enuy,  
> Nor am enuyde of any one therefore;  
> They that haue much, feare much to loose thereby,  
> And store of cares doth follow riches store.  
> The litle that I haue, growes dayly more  
> Without my care, but onely to attend it;  
> My lambes doe euery yeare increase their score,  
> And my flockes father daily doth amend it.  
> What haue I, but to praise th'Almighty, that doth send it?
>
> To them, that list, the worlds gay showes I leaue,  
> And to great ones such follies doe forgiue,  
> Which oft through pride do their owne perill weaue,  
> And through ambition downe themselues doe driue  
> To sad decay, that might contented liue.  
> Me no such cares nor combrous thoughts offend,  
> Ne once my minds vnmoued quiet grieue,  
> But all the night in siluer sleepe I spend,  
> And all the day, to what I list, I doe attend.
>
> Sometimes I hunt the Fox, the vowed foe  
> Vnto my Lambes, and him dislodge away;  
> Sometime the fawne I practise from the Doe,  
> Or from the Goat her kidde how to conuay;  
> Another while I baytes and nets display,  
> The birds to catch, or fishes to beguyle:  
> And when I wearie am, I downe doe lay  
> My limbes in euery shade, to rest from toyle,  
> And drinke of euery brooke, when thirst my throte doth boyle.
>
> The time was once, in my first prime of yeares,  
> When pride of youth forth pricked my desire,  
> That I disdain'd amongst mine equall peares  
> To follow sheepe, and shepheards base attire:  
> For further fortune then I would inquire.  
> And leauing home, to roiall court I sought;  
> Where I did sell my selfe for yearely hire,  
> And in the Princes gardin daily wrought:  
> There I beheld such vainenesse, as I neuer thought.
>
> With sight whereof soone cloyd, and long deluded  
> With idle hopes, which them doe entertaine,  
> After I had ten yeares my selfe excluded  
> From natiue home, and spent my youth in vaine,  
> I gan my follies to my selfe to plaine,  
> And this sweet peace, whose lacke did then appeare.  
> Tho backe returning to my sheepe againe,  
> I from thenceforth haue learn'd to loue more deare  
> This lowly quiet life, which I inherite here.
>
> Whylest thus he talkt, the knight with greedy eare  
> Hong still vpon his melting mouth attent;  
> Whose sensefull words empierst his hart so neare,  
> That he was rapt with double rauishment,  
> Both of his speach that wrought him great content,  
> And also of the obiect of his vew,  
> On which his hungry eye was alwayes bent;  
> That twixt his pleasing tongue, and her faire hew,  
> He lost himselfe, and like one halfe entraunced grew.
>
> Yet to occasion meanes, to worke his mind,  
> And to insinuate his harts desire,  
> He thus replyde; Now surely syre, I find,  
> That all this worlds gay showes, which we admire,  
> Be but vaine shadowes to this safe retyre  
> Of life, which here in lowlinesse ye lead,  
> Fearelesse of foes, or fortunes wrackfull yre,  
> Which tosseth states, and vnder foot doth tread  
> The mightie ones, affrayd of euery chaunges dread.
>
> That euen I which daily doe behold  
> The glorie of the great, mongst whom I won,  
> And now haue prou'd, what happineesse ye hold  
> In this small plot of your dominion,  
> Now loath great Lordship and ambition;  
> And wish the heauens so much had graced mee,  
> As graunt me liue in like condition;  
> Or that my fortunes might transposed bee  
> From pitch of higher place, vnto this low degree.
>
> In vaine (said then old *Meliboe*) doe men  
> The heauens of their fortunes fault accuse,  
> Sith they know best, what is the best for them:  
> For they to each such fortune doe diffuse,  
> As they doe know each can most aptly vse.  
> For not that, which men couet most, is best,  
> Nor that thing worst, which men do most refuse;  
> But fittest is, that all contented rest  
> With that they hold: each hath his fortune in his brest.
>
> It is the mynd, that maketh good or ill,  
> That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:  
> For some, that hath abundance at his will,  
> Hath not enough, but wants in greatest store;  
> And other, that hath litle, askes no more,  
> But in that litle is both rich and wise.  
> For wisedome is most riches; fooles therefore  
> They are, which fortunes doe by vowes deuize,  
> Sith each vnto himselfe his life may fortunize.
>
> Since then in each mans self (said *Calidore*)  
> It is, to fashion his owne lyfes estate,  
> Giue leaue awhyle, good father, in this shore  
> To rest my barcke, which hath bene beaten late  
> With stormes of fortune and tempestuous fate,  
> In seas of troubles and of toylesome paine,  
> That whether quite from them for to retrate  
> I shal resolue, or backe to turne againe,  
> I may here with your selfe some small repose obtaine.
>
> Not that the burden of so bold a guest  
> Shall chargefull be, or chaunge to you at all;  
> For your meane food shall be my daily feast,  
> And this your cabin both my bowre and hall.  
> Besides for recompence hereof, I shall  
> You well reward, and golden guerdon giue,  
> That may perhaps you better much withall,  
> And in this quiet make you safer liue.  
> So forth he drew much gold, and toward him it driue.
>
> But the good man, nought tempted with the offer  
> Of his rich mould, did thrust it farre away,  
> And thus bespake; Sir knight, your bounteous proffe\[r\]  
> Be farre fro me, to whom ye ill display  
> That mucky masse, the cause of mens decay,  
> That mote empaire my peace with daungers dread.  
> But if ye algates couet to assay  
> This simple sort of life, that shepheards lead,  
> Be it your owne: our rudenesse to your selfe aread.
>
> So there that night Sir *Calidore* did dwell,  
> And long while after, whilest him list remaine,  
> Dayly beholding the faire *Pastorell*,  
> And feeding on the bayt of his owne bane.  
> During which time he did her entertaine  
> With all kind courtesies, he could inuent;  
> And euery day, her companie to gaine,  
> When to the field she went, he with her went:  
> So for to quench his fire, he did it more augment.
>
> But she that neuer had acquainted beene  
> With such queint vsage, fit for Queenes and Kings,  
> Ne euer had such knightly seruice seene,  
> But being bred vnder base shepheards wings,  
> Had euer learn'd to loue the lowly things,  
> Did litle whit regard his courteous guize,  
> But cared more for *Colins* carolings  
> Then all that he could doe, or euer deuize:  
> His layes, his loues, his lookes she did them all despize.
>
> Which *Calidore* perceiuing, thought it best  
> To chaunge the manner of his loftie looke;  
> And doffing his bright armes, himselfe addrest  
> In shepheards weed, and in his hand he tooke,  
> In stead of steelehead speare, a shepheards hooke;  
> That who had seene him then, would haue bethought  
> On *Phrygian Paris* by *Plexippus* brooke,  
> When he the loue of fayre *Oenone* sought,  
> What time the golden apple was vnto him brought.
>
> So being clad, vnto the fields he went  
> With the faire *Pastorella* euery day,  
> And kept her sheepe with diligent attent,  
> Watching to driue the rauenous Wolfe away,  
> The whylest at pleasure she mote sport and play;  
> And euery euening helping them to fold:  
> And otherwhiles for need, he did assay  
> In his strong hand their rugged teats to hold,  
> And out of them to presse the milke: loue so much could.
>
> Which seeing *Coridon*, who her likewise  
> Long time had lou'd, and hop'd her loue to gaine,  
> He much was troubled at that straungers guize,  
> And many gealous thoughts conceiu'd in vaine,  
> That this of all his labour and long paine  
> Should reap the haruest, ere it ripened were;  
> That made him scoule, and pout, and oft complaine  
> Of *Pastorell* to all the shepheards there,  
> That she did loue a stranger swayne then him more dere.
>
> And euer when him came in companie,  
> Where *Calidore* was present, he would loure,  
> And byte his lip, and euen for gealousie  
> Was readie oft his owne hart to deuoure,  
> Impatient of any paramoure:  
> Who on the other side did seeme so farre  
> From malicing, or grudging his good houre,  
> That all he could, he graced him with her,  
> Ne euer shewed signe of rancour or of iarre.
>
> And oft, when *Coridon* vnto her brought  
> Or litle sparrowes, stolen from their nest,  
> Or wanton squirrels, in the woods farre sought,  
> Or other daintie thing for her addrest,  
> He would commend his guift, and make the best.  
> Yet she no whit his presents did regard,  
> Ne him could find to fancie in her brest:  
> This newcome shepheard had his market mard.  
> Old loue is litle worth when new is more prefard.
>
> One day when as the shepheard swaynes together  
> Were met, to make their sports and merrie glee,  
> As they are wont in faire sunshynie weather,  
> The whiles their flockes in shadowes shrouded bee,  
> They fell to daunce: then did they all agree,  
> That *Colin Clout* should pipe as one most fit;  
> And *Calidore* should lead the ring, as hee  
> That most in *Pastorellaes* grace did sit.  
> Thereat frown'd *Coridon*, and his lip closely bit.
>
> But *Calidore* of courteous inclination  
> Tooke *Coridon*, and set him in his place,  
> That he should lead the daunce, as was his fashion;  
> For *Coridon* could daunce, and trimly trace.  
> And when as *Pastorella*, him to grace,  
> Her flowry garlond tooke from her owne head,  
> And plast on his, he did it soone displace,  
> And did it put on *Coridons* in stead:  
> Then *Coridon* woxe frollicke, that earst seemed dead.
>
> Another time, when as they did dispose  
> To practise games, and maisteries to try,  
> They for their Iudge did *Pastorella* chose;  
> A garland was the meed of victory.  
> There *Coridon* forth stepping openly,  
> Did chalenge *Calidore* to wrestling game:  
> For he through long and perfect industry,  
> Therein well practisd was, and in the same  
> Thought sure t'auenge his grudge, & worke his foe great shame.
>
> But *Calidore* he greatly did mistake;  
> For he was strong and mightily stiffe pight,  
> That with one fall his necke he almost brake,  
> And had he not vpon him fallen light,  
> His dearest ioynt he sure had broken quight.  
> Then was the oaken crowne by *Pastorell*  
> Giuen to *Calidore*, as his due right;  
> But he, that did in courtesie excell,  
> Gaue it to *Coridon*, and said he wonne it well.
>
> Thus did the gentle knight himselfe abeare  
> Amongst that rusticke rout in all his deeds,  
> That euen they, the which his riuals were,  
> Could not maligne him, but commend him needs:  
> For courtesie amongst the rudest breds  
> Good will and fauour. So it surely wrought  
> With this faire Mayd, and in her mynde the seeds  
> Of perfect loue did sow, that last forth brought  
> The fruite of ioy and blisse, though long time dearely bought.
>
> Thus *Calidore* continu'd there long time,  
> To winne the loue of the faire *Pastorell*;  
> Which hauing got, he vsed without crime  
> Or blamefull blot, but menaged so well,  
> That he of all the rest, which there did \[d\]well,  
> Was fauoured, and to her grace commmended.  
> But what straunge fortunes vnto him befell,  
> Ere he attain'd the point by him intended,  
> Shall more conueniently in other place be ended.
