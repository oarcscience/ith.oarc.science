*Canto I.*

> *Guyon encountreth Britomart,  
> faire Florimell is chaced:  
> Duessaes traines and Malecastaes  
> champions are defaced.*

> T He famous Briton Prince and Faerie knight,  
> After long wayes and perilous paines endured,  
> Hauing their wearie limbes to perfect plight  
> Restord, and sory wounds right well recured,  
> Of the faire *Alma* greatly were procured,  
> To make there lenger soiourne and abode;  
> But when thereto they might not be allured,  
> From seeking praise, and deeds of armes abrode,  
> They courteous conge tooke, and forth together yode.
>
> But the captiu'd *Acrasia* he sent,  
> Because of trauell long, a nigher way,  
> With a strong gard, all reskew to preuent,  
> And her to Faerie court safe to conuay,  
> That her for witnesse of his hard assay,  
> Vnto his *Faerie* Queene he might present:  
> But he him selfe betooke another way,  
> To make more triall of his hardiment,  
> And seeke aduentures, as he with Prince *Arthur* went.
>
> Long so they trauelled through wastefull wayes,  
> Where daungers dwelt, and perils most did wonne,  
> To hunt for glorie and renowmed praise;  
> Full many Countries they did ouerronne,  
> From the vprising to the setting Sunne,  
> And many hard aduentures did atchieue;  
> Of all the which they honour euer wonne,  
> Seeking the weake oppressed to relieue,  
> And to recouer right for such, as wrong did grieue.
>
> At last as through an open plaine they yode,  
> They spide a knight, that towards pricked faire,  
> And him beside an aged Squire there rode,  
> That seem'd to couch vnder his shield three-square,  
> As if that age bad him that burden spare,  
> And yield it those, that stouter could it wield:  
> He them espying, gan himselfe prepare,  
> And on his arme addresse his goodly shield  
> That bore a Lion passant in a golden field.
>
> Which seeing good Sir *Guyon*, deare besought  
> The Prince of grace, to let him runne that turne.  
> He graunted: then the Faery quickly raught  
> His poinant speare, and sharpely gan to spurne  
> His fomy steed, whose fierie feete did burne  
> The verdant grasse, as he thereon did tread;  
> Ne did the other backe his foot returne,  
> But fiercely forward came withouten dread,  
> And bent his dreadfull speare against the others head.
>
> They bene ymet, and both their points arriued,  
> But *Guyon* droue so furious and fell,  
> That seem'd both shield & plate it would haue riued;  
> Nathelesse it bore his foe not from his sell,  
> But made him stagger, as he were not well:  
> But *Guyon* selfe, ere well he was aware,  
> Nigh a speares length behind his crouper fell,  
> Yet in his fall so well him selfe he bare,  
> That mischieuous mischance his life & limbes did spare.
>
> Great shame and sorrow of that fall he tooke;  
> For neuer yet, sith warlike armes he bore,  
> And shiuering speare in bloudie field first shooke,  
> He found himselfe dishonored so sore.  
> Ah gentlest knight, that euer armour bore,  
> Let not thee grieue dismounted to haue beene,  
> And brought to ground, that neuer wast before;  
> For not thy fault, but secret powre vnseene,  
> That speare enchaunted was, which layd thee on the greene.
>
> But weenedst thou what wight thee ouerthrew,  
> Much greater griefe and shamefuller regret  
> For thy hard fortune then thou wouldst renew,  
> That of a single damzell thou wert met  
> On equall plaine, and there so hard beset;  
> Euen the famous *Britomart* it was,  
> Whom straunge aduenture did from *Britaine* fet,  
> To seeke her louer (loue farre sought alas,)  
> Whose image she had seene in *Venus* looking glas.
>
> Full of disdainefull wrath, he fierce vprose,  
> For to reuenge that foule reprochfull shame,  
> And snatching his bright sword began to close  
> With her on foot, and stoutly forward came;  
> Die rather would he, then endure that same.  
> Which when his Palmer saw, he gan to feare  
> His toward perill and vntoward blame,  
> Which by that new rencounter he should reare:  
> For death sate on the point of that enchaunted speare.
>
> And hasting towards him gan faire perswade,  
> Not to prouoke misfortune, nor to weene  
> His speares default to mend with cruell blade;  
> For by his mightie Science he had seene  
> The secret vertue of that weapon keene,  
> That mortall puissance mote not withstond:  
> Nothing on earth mote alwaies happie beene.  
> Great hazard were it, and aduenture fond,  
> To loose long gotten honour with one euill hond.
>
> By such good meanes he him discounselled,  
> From prosecuting his reuenging rage;  
> And eke the Prince like treaty handeled,  
> His wrathfull will with reason to asswage,  
> And laid the blame, not to his carriage,  
> But to his starting steed, that swaru'd asyde,  
> And to the ill purueyance of his page,  
> That had his furnitures not firmely tyde:  
> So is his angry courage fairely pacifyde.
>
> Thus reconcilement was betweene them knit,  
> Through goodly temperance, and affection chaste,  
> And either vowd with all their power and wit,  
> To let not others honour be defaste,  
> Of friend or foe, who euer it embaste,  
> Ne armes to beare against the others syde:  
> In which accord the Prince was also plaste,  
> And with that golden chaine of concord tyde.  
> So goodly all agreed, they forth yfere did ryde.
>
> O goodly vsage of those antique times,  
> In which the sword was seruant vnto right;  
> When not for malice and contentious crimes,  
> But all for praise, and proofe of manly might,  
> The martiall brood accustomed to fight:  
> Then honour was the meed of victorie,  
> And yet the vanquished had no despight:  
> Let later age that noble vse enuie,  
> Vile rancour to auoid, and cruell surquedrie.
>
> Long they thus trauelled in friendly wise,  
> Through countries waste, and eke well edifyde,  
> Seeking aduentures hard, to exercise  
> Their puissance, whylome full dernely tryde:  
> At length they came into a forrest wyde,  
> Whose hideous horror and sad trembling sound  
> Full griesly seem'd: therein they long did ryde,  
> Yet tract of liuing creatures none they found,  
> Saue Beares, Lions, & Buls, which romed them around.
>
> All suddenly out of the thickest brush,  
> Vpon a milk-white Palfrey all alone,  
> A goodly Ladie did foreby them rush,  
> Whose face did seeme as cleare as Christall stone,  
> And eke through feare as white as whales bone:  
> Her garments all were wrought of beaten gold,  
> And all her steed with tinsell trappings shone,  
> Which fled so fast, that nothing mote him hold,  
> And scarse them leasure gaue, her passing to behold.
>
> Still as she fled, her eye she backward threw,  
> As fearing euill, that pursewd her fast;  
> And her faire yellow locks behind her flew,  
> Loosely disperst with puffe of euery blast:  
> All as a blazing starre doth farre outcast  
> His hearie beames, and flaming lockes dispred,  
> At sight whereof the people stand aghast:  
> But the sage wisard telles, as he has red,  
> That it importunes death and dolefull drerihed.
>
> So as they gazed after her a while,  
> Lo where a griesly Foster forth did rush,  
> Breathing out beastly lust her to defile:  
> His tyreling iade he fiercely forth did push,  
> Through thicke and thin, both ouer banke and bush  
> In hope her to attaine by hooke or crooke,  
> That from his gorie sides the bloud did gush:  
> Large were his limbes, and terrible his looke,  
> And in his clownish hand a sharp bore speare he shooke.
>
> Which outrage when those gentle knights did see,  
> Full of great enuie and fell gealosy,  
> They stayd not to auise, who first should bee,  
> But all spurd after fast, as they mote fly,  
> To reskew her from shamefull villany.  
> The Prince and *Guyon* equally byliue  
> Her selfe pursewd, in hope to win thereby  
> Most goodly meede, the fairest Dame aliue:  
> But after the foule foster *Timias* did striue.
>
> The whiles faire *Britomart*, whose constant mind,  
> Would not so lightly follow beauties chace,  
> Ne reckt of Ladies Loue, did stay behind,  
> And them awayted there a certaine space,  
> To weet if they would turne backe to that place:  
> But when she saw them gone, she forward went,  
> As lay her iourney, through that perlous Pace,  
> With stedfast courage and stout hardiment;  
> Ne euill thing she fear'd, ne euill thing she ment.
>
> At last as nigh out of the wood she came,  
> A stately Castle farre away she spyde,  
> To which her steps directly she did frame.  
> That Castle was most goodly edifyde,  
> And plaste for pleasure nigh that forrest syde:  
> But faire before the gate a spatious plaine,  
> Mantled with greene, it selfe did spredden wyde,  
> On which she saw sixe knights, that did darraine  
> Fierce battell against one, with cruell might and maine.
>
> Mainly they all attonce vpon him laid,  
> And sore beset on euery side around,  
> That nigh he breathlesse grew, yet nought dismaid,  
> Ne euer to them yielded foot of ground  
> All had he lost much bloud through many a wound,  
> But stoutly dealt his blowes, and euery way  
> To which he turned in his wrathfull stound,  
> Made them recoile, and fly from dred decay,  
> That none of all the sixe before, him durst assay.
>
> Like dastard Curres, that hauing at a bay  
> The saluage beast embost in wearie chace,  
> Dare not aduenture on the stubborne pray,  
> Ne byte before, but rome from place to place,  
> To get a snatch, when turned is his face.  
> In such distresse and doubtfull ieopardy,  
> When *Britomart* him saw, she ran a pace  
> Vnto his reskew, and with earnest cry,  
> Bad those same sixe forbeare that single enimy.
>
> But to her cry they list not lenden eare,  
> Ne ought the more their mightie strokes surceasse,  
> But gathering him round about more neare,  
> Their direfull rancour rather did encreasse;  
> Till that she rushing through the thickest preasse,  
> Perforce disparted their compacted gyre,  
> And soone compeld to hearken vnto peace:  
> Tho gan she myldly of them to inquyre  
> The cause of their dissention and outrageous yre.
>
> Whereto that single knight did answere frame;  
> These sixe would me enforce by oddes of might,  
> To chaunge my liefe, and loue another Dame,  
> That death me liefer were, then such despight,  
> So vnto wrong to yield my wrested right:  
> For I loue one, the truest one on ground,  
> Ne list me chaunge; she th'*Errant Damzell* hight,  
> For whose deare sake full many a bitter stownd,  
> I haue endur'd, and tasted many a bloudy wound.
>
> Certes (said she) then bene ye sixe to blame,  
> To weene your wrong by force to iustifie:  
> For knight to leaue his Ladie were great shame,  
> That faithfull is, and better were to die.  
> All losse is lesse, and lesse the infamie,  
> Then losse of loue to him, that loues but one;  
> Ne may loue be compeld by maisterie;  
> For soone as maisterie comes, sweet loue anone  
> Taketh his nimble wings, and soone away is gone.
>
> Then spake one of those sixe, There dwelleth here  
> Within this castle wall a Ladie faire,  
> Whose soueraine beautie hath no liuing pere,  
> Thereto so bounteous and so debonaire,  
> That neuer any mote with her compaire.  
> She hath ordaind this law, which we approue,  
> That euery knight, which doth this way repaire,  
> In case he haue no Ladie, nor no loue,  
> Shall doe vnto her seruice neuer to remoue.
>
> But if he haue a Ladie or a Loue,  
> Then must he her forgoe with foule defame,  
> Or else with vs by dint of sword approue,  
> That she is fairer, then our fairest Dame,  
> As did this knight, before ye hither came.  
> Perdie (said *Britomart*) the choise is hard:  
> But what reward had he, that ouercame?  
> He should aduaunced be to high regard,  
> (Said they) and haue our Ladies loue for his reward.
>
> Therefore a read Sir, if thou haue a loue.  
> Loue haue I sure, (quoth she) but Lady none;  
> Yet will I not fro mine owne loue remoue,  
> Ne to your Lady will I seruice done,  
> But wreake your wrongs wrought to this knight alone,  
> And proue his cause. With that her mortall speare  
> She mightily auentred towards one,  
> And downe him smot, ere well aware he weare,  
> Then to the next she rode, & downe the next did beare.
>
> Ne did she stay, till three on ground she layd,  
> That none of them himselfe could reare againe;  
> The fourth was by that other knight dismayd,  
> All were he wearie of his former paine,  
> That now there do but two of six remaine;  
> Which two did yield, before she did them smight.  
> Ah (said she then) now may ye all see plaine,  
> That truth is strong, and trew loue most of might,  
> That for his trusty seruaunts doth so strongly fight.
>
> Too well we see, (said they) and proue too well  
> Our faulty weaknesse, and your matchlesse might:  
> For thy, faire Sir, yours be the Damozell,  
> Which by her owne law to your lot doth light,  
> And we your liege men faith vnto you plight.  
> So vnderneath her feet their swords they mard,  
> And after her besought, well as they might,  
> To enter in, and reape the dew reward:  
> She graunted, and then in they all together far'd.
>
> Long were it to describe the goodly frame,  
> And stately port of *Castle Ioyeous*,  
> (For so that Castle hight by commune name)  
> Where they were entertaind with curteous  
> And comely glee of many gracious  
> Faire Ladies, and of many a gentle knight,  
> Who through a Chamber long and spacious,  
> Eftsoones them brought vnto their Ladies sight,  
> That of them cleeped was the *Lady of delight*.
>
> But for to tell the sumptuous aray  
> Of that great chamber, should be labour lost:  
> For liuing wit, I weene, cannot display  
> The royall riches and exceeding cost,  
> Of euery pillour and of euery post;  
> Which all of purest bullion framed were,  
> And with great pearles and pretious stones embost,  
> That the bright glister of their beames cleare  
> Did sparckle forth great light, and glorious did appeare.
>
> These straunger knights through passing, forth were led  
> Into an inner rowme, whose royaltee  
> And rich purueyance might vneath be red;  
> Mote Princes place beseeme so deckt to bee.  
> Which stately manner when as they did see,  
> The image of superfluous riotize,  
> Exceeding much the state of meane degree,  
> They greatly wondred, whence so sumptuous guize  
> Might be maintaynd, and each gan diuersely deuize.
>
> The wals were round about apparelled  
> With costly clothes of *Arras* and of *Toure*,  
> In which with cunning hand was pourtrahed  
> The loue of *Venus* and her Paramoure  
> The faire *Adonis*, turned to a flowre,  
> A worke of rare deuice, and wondrous wit.  
> First did it shew the bitter balefull stowre,  
> Which her assayd with many a feruent fit,  
> When first her tender hart was with his beautie smit.
>
> Then with what sleights and sweet allurements she  
> Entyst the Boy, as well that art she knew,  
> And wooed him her Paramoure to be;  
> Now making girlonds of each flowre that grew,  
> To crowne his golden lockes with honour dew;  
> Now leading him into a secret shade  
> From his Beauperes, and from bright heauens vew,  
> Where him to sleepe she gently would perswade,  
> Or bathe him in a fountaine by some couert glade.
>
> And whilst he slept, she ouer him would spred  
> Her mantle, colour'd like the starry skyes,  
> And her soft arme lay vnderneath his hed,  
> And with ambrosiall kisses bathe his eyes;  
> And whilest he bath'd, with her two crafty spyes,  
> She secretly would search each daintie lim,  
> And throw into the well sweet Rosemaryes,  
> And fragrant violets, and Pances trim,  
> And euer with sweet Nectar she did sprinkle him.
>
> So did she steale his heedelesse hart away,  
> And ioyd his loue in secret vnespyde.  
> But for she saw him bent to cruell play,  
> To hunt the saluage beast in forrest wyde,  
> Dreadfull of daunger, that mote him betyde,  
> She oft and oft aduiz'd him to refraine  
> From chase of greater beasts, whose brutish pryde  
> Mote breede him scath vnwares: but all in vaine;  
> For who can shun the chaunce, that dest'ny doth ordaine?
>
> Lo, where beyond he lyeth languishing,  
> Deadly engored of a great wild Bore,  
> And by his side the Goddesse groueling  
> Makes for him endlesse mone, and euermore  
> With her soft garment wipes away the gore,  
> Which staines his snowy skin with hatefull hew:  
> But when she saw no helpe might him restore,  
> Him to a dainty flowre she did transmew,  
> Which in that cloth was wrought, as if it liuely grew.
>
> So was that chamber clad in goodly wize,  
> And round about it many beds were dight,  
> As whilome was the antique worldes guize,  
> Some for vntimely ease, some for delight,  
> As pleased them to vse, that vse it might:  
> And all was full of Damzels, and of Squires,  
> Dauncing and reueling both day and night,  
> And swimming deepe in sensuall desires,  
> And *Cupid* still emongst them kindled lustfull fires.
>
> And all the while sweet Musicke did diuide  
> Her looser notes with *Lydian* harmony;  
> And all the while sweet birdes thereto applide  
> Their daintie layes and dulcet melody,  
> Ay caroling of loue and iollity,  
> That wonder was to heare their trim consort.  
> Which when those knights beheld, with scornefull eye,  
> They sdeigned such lasciuious disport,  
> And loath'd the loose demeanure of that wanton sort.
>
> Thence they were brought to that great Ladies vew,  
> Whom they found sitting on a sumptuous bed,  
> That glistred all with gold and glorious shew,  
> As the proud *Persian* Queenes accustomed:  
> She seemd a woman of great bountihed,  
> And of rare beautie, sauing that askaunce  
> Her wanton eyes, ill signes of womanhed,  
> Did roll too highly, and too often glaunce,  
> Without regard of grace, or comely amenaunce.
>
> Long worke it were, and needlesse to deuize  
> Their goodly entertainement and great glee:  
> She caused them be led in curteous wize  
> Into a bowre, disarmed for to bee,  
> And cheared well with wine and spiceree:  
> The *Redcrosse* Knight was soone disarmed there,  
> But the braue Mayd would not disarmed bee,  
> But onely vented vp her vmbriere,  
> And so did let her goodly visage to appere.
>
> As when faire *Cynthia*, in darkesome night,  
> Is in a noyous cloud enueloped,  
> Where she may find the substaunce thin and light,  
> Breakes forth her siluer beames, and her bright hed  
> Discouers to the world discomfited;  
> Of the poore traueller, that went astray,  
> With thousand blessings she is heried;  
> Such was the beautie and the shining ray,  
> With which faire *Britomart* gaue light vnto the day.
>
> And eke those six, which lately with her fought,  
> Now were disarmd, and did them selues present  
> Vnto her vew, and company vnsoght;  
> For they all seemed curteous and gent,  
> And all sixe brethren, borne of one parent,  
> Which had them traynd in all ciuilitee,  
> And goodly taught to tilt and turnament;  
> Now were they liegemen to this Lady free,  
> And her knights seruice ought, to hold of her in fee.
>
> The first of them by name *Gardante* hight,  
> A iolly person, and of comely vew;  
> The second was *Parlante*, a bold knight,  
> And next to him *Iocante* did ensew;  
> *Basciante* did him selfe most curteous shew;  
> But fierce *Bacchante* seemd too fell and keene;  
> And yet in armes *Noctante* greater grew:  
> All were faire knights, and goodly well beseene,  
> But to faire *Britomart* they all but shadowes beene.
>
> For she was full of amiable grace,  
> And manly terrour mixed therewithall,  
> That as the one stird vp affections bace,  
> So th'other did mens rash desires apall,  
> And hold them backe, that would in errour fall;  
> As he, that hath espide a vermeill Rose,  
> To which sharpe thornes and breres the way forstall,  
> Dare not for dread his hardy hand expose,  
> But wishing it far off, his idle wish doth lose.
>
> Whom when the Lady saw so faire a wight.  
> All ignoraunt of her contrary sex,  
> (For she her weend a fresh and lusty knight)  
> She greatly gan enamoured to wex,  
> And with vaine thoughts her falsed fancy vex:  
> Her fickle hart conceiued hasty fire,  
> Like sparkes of fire, which fall in sclender flex,  
> That shortly brent into extreme desire,  
> And ransackt all her veines with passion entire.
>
> Eftsoones she grew to great impatience  
> And into termes of open outrage brust,  
> That plaine discouered her incontinence,  
> Ne reckt she, who her meaning did mistrust;  
> For she was giuen all to fleshly lust,  
> And poured forth in sensuall delight,  
> That all regard of shame she had discust,  
> And meet respect of honour put to flight:  
> So shamelesse beauty soone becomes a loathy sight.
>
> Faire Ladies, that to loue captiued arre,  
> And chaste desires do nourish in your mind,  
> Let not her fault your sweet affections marre,  
> Ne blot the bounty of all womankind;  
> 'Mongst thousands good one wanton Dame to find:  
> Emongst the Roses grow some wicked weeds;  
> For this was not to loue, but lust inclind;  
> For loue does alwayes bring forth bounteous deeds,  
> And in each gentle hart desire of honour breeds.
>
> Nought so of loue this looser Dame did skill,  
> But as a coale to kindle fleshly flame,  
> Giuing the bridle to her wanton will,  
> And treading vnder foote her honest name:  
> Such loue is hate, and such desire is shame.  
> Still did she roue at her with crafty glaunce  
> Of her false eyes, that at her hart did ayme,  
> And told her meaning in her countenaunce;  
> But *Britomart* dissembled it with ignoraunce.
>
> Supper was shortly dight and downe they sat,  
> Where they were serued with all sumptuous fare,  
> Whiles fruitfull *Ceres*, and *Lyæus* fat  
> Pourd out their plenty, without spight or spare:  
> Nought wanted there, that dainty was and rare;  
> And aye the cups their bancks did ouerflow,  
> And aye betweene the cups, she did prepare  
> Way to her loue, and secret darts did throw;  
> But *Britomart* would not such guilfull message know.
>
> So when they slaked had the feruent heat  
> Of appetite with meates of euery sort,  
> The Lady did faire *Britomart* entreat,  
> Her to disarme, and with delightfull sport  
> To loose her warlike limbs and strong effort,  
> But when she mote not thereunto be wonne,  
> (For she her sexe vnder that straunge purport  
> Did vse to hide, and plaine apparaunce shonne:)  
> In plainer wise to tell her grieuaunce she begonne.
>
> And all attonce discouered her desire  
> With sighes, and sobs, and plaints, & piteous griefe,  
> The outward sparkes of her in burning fire;  
> Which spent in vaine, at last she told her briefe,  
> That but if she did lend her short reliefe,  
> And do her comfort, she mote algates dye.  
> But the chaste damzell, that had neuer priefe  
> Of such malengine and fine forgerie,  
> Did easily beleeue her strong extremitie.
>
> Full easie was for her to haue beliefe,  
> Who by self-feeling of her feeble sexe,  
> And by long triall of the inward griefe,  
> Wherewith imperious loue her hart did vexe,  
> Could iudge what paines do louing harts perplexe.  
> Who meanes no guile, be guiled soonest shall,  
> And to faire semblaunce doth light faith annexe;  
> The bird, that knowes not the false fowlers call,  
> Into his hidden net full easily doth fall.
>
> For thy, she would not in discourteise wise,  
> Scorne the faire offer of good will profest;  
> For great rebuke it is, loue to despise,  
> Or rudely sdeigne a gentle harts request;  
> But with faire countenaunce, as beseemed best,  
> Her entertaynd; nath'lesse she inly deemd  
> Her loue too light, to wooe a wandring guest:  
> Which she misconstruing, thereby esteemd  
> That from like inward fire that outward smoke had steemd.
>
> Therewith a while she her flit fancy fed,  
> Till she mote winne fit time for her desire,  
> But yet her wound still inward freshly bled,  
> And through her bones the false instilled fire  
> Did spred it selfe, and venime close inspire.  
> Tho were the tables taken all away,  
> And euery knight, and euery gentle Squire  
> Gan choose his dame with *Basciomani* gay,  
> With whom he meant to make his sport & courtly play.
>
> Some fell to daunce, some fell to hazardry,  
> Some to make loue, some to make meriment,  
> As diuerse wits to diuers things apply;  
> And all the while faire *Malecasta* bent  
> Her crafty engins to her close intent.  
> By this th'eternall lampes, wherewith high *Ioue*  
> Doth light the lower world, were halfe yspent,  
> And the moist daughters of huge *Atlas* stroue  
> Into the *Ocean* deepe to driue their weary droue.
>
> High time it seemed then for euery wight  
> Them to betake vnto their kindly rest;  
> Eftsoones long waxen torches weren light,  
> Vnto their bowres to guiden euery guest:  
> Tho when the Britonesse saw all the rest  
> Auoided quite, she gan her selfe despoile,  
> And safe commit to her soft fethered nest,  
> Where through long watch, & late dayes weary toile,  
> She soundly slept, & carefull thoughts did quite assoile.
>
> Now whenas all the world in silence deepe  
> Yshrowded was, and euery mortall wight  
> Was drowned in the depth of deadly sleepe,  
> Faire *Malecasta*, whose engrieued spright  
> Could find no rest in such perplexed plight,  
> Lightly arose out of her wearie bed,  
> And vnder the blacke vele of guilty Night,  
> Her with a scarlot mantle couered,  
> That was with gold and Ermines faire enueloped.
>
> Then panting soft, and trembling euerie ioynt,  
> Her fearfull feete towards the bowre she moued;  
> Where she for secret purpose did appoynt  
> To lodge the warlike mayd vnwisely loued,  
> And to her bed approching, first she prooued,  
> Whether she slept or wakt, with her soft hand  
> She softly felt, if any member mooued,  
> And lent her wary eare to vnderstand,  
> If any puffe of breath, or signe of sence she fand.
>
> Which whenas none she fond, with easie shift,  
> For feare least her vnwares she should abrayd,  
> Th'embroderd quilt she lightly vp did lift,  
> And by her side her selfe she softly layd,  
> Of euery finest fingers touch affrayd;  
> Ne any noise she made, ne word she spake,  
> But inly sigh'd. At last the royall Mayd  
> Out of her quiet slomber did awake,  
> And chaungd her weary side, the better ease to take.
>
> Where feeling one close couched by her side,  
> She lightly lept out of her filed bed,  
> And to her weapon ran, in minde to gride  
> The loathed leachour. But the Dame halfe ded  
> Through suddein feare and ghastly drerihed,  
> Did shrieke alowd, that through the house it rong,  
> And the whole family therewith adred,  
> Rashly out of their rouzed couches sprong,  
> And to the troubled chamber all in armes did throng.
>
> And those six Knights that Ladies Champions,  
> And eke the *Redcrosse* knight ran to the stownd,  
> Halfe armd and halfe vnarmd, with them attons:  
> Where when confusedly they came, they fownd  
> Their Lady lying on the sencelesse grownd;  
> On th'other side, they saw the warlike Mayd  
> All in her snow-white smocke, with locks vnbownd,  
> Threatning the point of her auenging blade,  
> That with so troublous terrour they were all dismayde.
>
> About their Lady first they flockt arownd,  
> Whom hauing laid in comfortable couch,  
> Shortly they reard out of her frosen swownd;  
> And afterwards they gan with fowle reproch  
> To stirre vp strife, and troublous contecke broch:  
> But by ensample of the last dayes losse,  
> None of them rashly durst to her approch,  
> Ne in so glorious spoile themselues embosse;  
> Her succourd eke the Champion of the bloudy Crosse.
>
> But one of those sixe knights, *Gardante* hight,  
> Drew out a deadly bow and arrow keene,  
> Which forth he sent with felonous despight,  
> And fell intent against the virgin sheene:  
> The mortall steele stayd not, till it was seene  
> To gore her side, yet was the wound not deepe,  
> But lightly rased her soft silken skin,  
> That drops of purple bloud thereout did weepe,  
> Which did her lilly smock with staines of vermeil steepe.
>
> Wherewith enrag'd she fiercely at them flew,  
> And with her flaming sword about her layd,  
> That none of them foule mischiefe could eschew,  
> But with her dreadfull strokes were all dismayd:  
> Here, there, and euery where about her swayd  
> Her wrathfull steele, that none mote it abide;  
> And eke the *Redcrosse* knight gaue her good aid,  
> Ay ioyning foot to foot, and side to side,  
> That in short space their foes they haue quite terrifide.
>
> Tho whenas all were put to shamefull flight,  
> The noble *Britomartis* her arayd,  
> And her bright armes about her body dight:  
> For nothing would she lenger there be stayd,  
> Where so loose life, and so vngentle trade  
> Was vsd of Knights and Ladies seeming gent:  
> So earely ere the grosse Earthes gryesy shade  
> Was all disperst out of the firmament,  
> They tooke their steeds, & forth vpõ their iourney went.
