*Cant. VI.*

> *The birth of faire Belphoebe and  
> Of Amoret is told.  
> The Gardins of Adonis fraught  
> With pleasures manifold.*

> VV Ell may I weene, faire Ladies, all this while  
> Ye wonder, how this noble Damozell  
> So great perfections did in her compile,  
> Sith that in saluage forests she did dwell,  
> So farre from court and royall Citadell,  
> The great schoolmistresse of all curtesy:  
> Seemeth that such wild woods should far expell  
> All ciuill vsage and gentility,  
> And gentle sprite deforme with rude rusticity.
>
> But to this faire *Belphoebe* in her berth  
> The heauens so fauourable were and free,  
> Looking with myld aspect vpon the earth,  
> In th'*Horoscope* of her natiuitee,  
> That all the gifts of grace and chastitee  
> On her they poured forth of plenteous horne;  
> *Ioue* laught on *Venus* from his soueraigne see,  
> And *Phoebus* with faire beames did her adorne,  
> And all the *Graces* rockt her cradle being borne.
>
> Her berth was of the wombe of Morning dew,  
> And her conception of the ioyous Prime,  
> And all her whole creation did her shew  
> Pure and vnspotted from all loathly crime,  
> That is ingenerate in fleshly slime.  
> So was this virgin borne, so was she bred,  
> So was she trayned vp from time to time,  
> In all chast vertue, and true bounti-hed  
> Till to her dew perfection she was ripened.
>
> Her mother was the faire *Chrysogonee*,  
> The daughter of *Amphisa*, who by race  
> A Faerie was, yborne of high degree,  
> She bore *Belphoebe*, she bore in like cace  
> Faire *Amoretta* in the second place:  
> These two were twinnes, & twixt them two did share  
> The heritage of all celestiall grace.  
> That all the rest it seem'd they robbed bare  
> Of bountie, and of beautie, and all vertues rare.
>
> It were a goodly storie, to declare,  
> By what straunge accident faire *Chrysogone*  
> Conceiu'd these infants, and how them she bare,  
> In this wild forrest wandring all alone,  
> After she had nine moneths fulfild and gone:  
> For not as other wemens commune brood,  
> They were enwombed in the sacred throne  
> Of her chaste bodie, nor with commune food,  
> As other wemens babes, they sucked vitall blood.
>
> But wondrously they were begot, and bred  
> Through influence of th'heauens fruitfull ray,  
> As it in antique bookes is mentioned.  
> It was vpon a Sommers shynie day,  
> When *Titan* faire his beames did display,  
> In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,  
> She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;  
> She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,  
> And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.
>
> Till faint through irkesome wearinesse, adowne  
> Vpon the grassie ground her selfe she layd  
> To sleepe, the whiles a gentle slombring swowne  
> Vpon her fell all naked bare displayd;  
> The sunne-beames bright vpon her body playd,  
> Being through former bathing mollifide,  
> And pierst into her wombe, where they embayd  
> With so sweet sence and secret power vnspide,  
> That in her pregnant flesh they shortly fructifide.
>
> Miraculous may seeme to him, that reades  
> So straunge ensample of conception;  
> But reason teacheth that the fruitfull seades  
> Of all things liuing, through impression  
> Of the sunbeames in moyst complexion,  
> Doe life conceiue and quickned are by kynd:  
> So after *Nilus* invndation,  
> Infinite shapes of creatures men do fynd,  
> Informed in the mud, on which the Sunne hath shynd.
>
> Great father he of generation  
> Is rightly cald, th'author of life and light;  
> And his faire sister for creation  
> Ministreth matter fit, which tempred right  
> With heate and humour, breedes the liuing wight.  
> So sprong these twinnes in wombe of *Chrysogone*,  
> Yet wist she nought thereof, but sore affright,  
> Wondred to see her belly so vpblone,  
> Which still increast, till she her terme had full outgone.
>
> Whereof conceiuing shame and foule disgrace,  
> Albe her guiltlesse conscience her cleard,  
> She fled into the wildernesse a space,  
> Till that vnweeldy burden she had reard,  
> And shund dishonor, which as death she feard:  
> Where wearie of long trauell, downe to rest  
> Her selfe she set, and comfortably cheard;  
> There a sad cloud of sleepe her ouerkest,  
> And seized euery sense with sorrow sore opprest.
>
> It fortuned, faire *Venus* hauing lost  
> Her little sonne, the winged god of loue,  
> Who for some light displeasure, which him crost,  
> Was from her fled, as flit as ayerie Doue,  
> And left her blisfull bowre of ioy aboue,  
> (So from her often he had fled away,  
> When she for ought him sharpely did reproue,  
> And wandred in the world in strange aray,  
> Disguiz'd in thousand shapes, that none might him bewray.)
>
> Him for to seeke, she left her heauenly hous,  
> The house of goodly formes and faire aspects,  
> Whence all the world deriues the glorious  
> Features of beautie, and all shapes select,  
> With which high God his workmanship hath deckt;  
> And searched euery way, through which his wings  
> Had borne him, or his tract she mote detect:  
> She promist kisses sweet, and sweeter things  
> Vnto the man, that of him tydings to her brings.
>
> First she him sought in Court, where most he vsed  
> Whylome to haunt, but there she found him not;  
> But many there she found, which sore accused  
> His falsehood, and with foule infamous blot  
> His cruell deedes and wicked wyles did spot:  
> Ladies and Lords she euery where mote heare  
> Complayning, how with his empoysned shot  
> Their wofull harts he wounded had whyleare,  
> And so had left them languishing twixt hope and feare.
>
> She then the Citties sought from gate to gate,  
> And euery one did aske, did he him see;  
> And euery one her answerd, that too late  
> He had him seene, and felt the crueltie  
> Of his sharpe darts and whot artillerie;  
> And euery one threw forth reproches rife  
> Of his mischieuous deedes, and said, that hee  
> Was the disturber of all ciuill life,  
> The enimy of peace, and author of all strife.
>
> Then in the countrey she abroad him sought,  
> And in the rurall cottages inquired,  
> Where also many plaints to her were brought,  
> How he their heedlesse harts with loue had fyred,  
> And his false venim through their veines inspyred;  
> And eke the gentle shepheard swaynes, which sat  
> Keeping their fleecie flockes, as they were hyred,  
> She sweetly heard complaine, both how and what  
> Her sonne had to them doen; yet she did smile thereat.
>
> But when in none of all these she him got,  
> She gan auize, where else he mote him hyde:  
> At last she her bethought, that she had not  
> Yet sought the saluage woods and forrests wyde,  
> In which full many louely Nymphes abyde,  
> Mongst whom might be, that he did closely lye,  
> Or that the loue of some of them him tyde:  
> For thy, she thither cast her course t'apply,  
> To search the secret haunts of *Dianes* company.
>
> Shortly vnto the wastefull woods she came,  
> Whereas she found the Goddesse with her crew,  
> After late chace of their embrewed game,  
> Sitting beside a fountaine in a rew,  
> Some of them washing with the liquid dew  
> From off their dainty limbes the dustie sweat,  
> And soyle which did deforme their liuely hew;  
> Others lay shaded from the scorching heat;  
> The rest vpon her person gaue attendance great.
>
> She hauing hong vpon a bough on high  
> Her bow and painted quiuer, had vnlaste  
> Her siluer buskins from her nimble thigh,  
> And her lancke loynes vngirt, and brests vnbraste,  
> After her heat the breathing cold to taste;  
> Her golden lockes, that late in tresses bright  
> Embreaded were for hindring of her haste,  
> Now loose about her shoulders hong vndight,  
> And were with sweet *Ambrosia* all besprinckled light.
>
> Soone as she *Venus* saw behind her backe,  
> She was asham'd to be so loose surprized,  
> And woxe halfe wroth against her damzels slacke,  
> That had not her thereof before auized,  
> But suffred her so carelesly disguized  
> Be ouertaken. Soone her garments loose  
> Vpgath'ring, in her bosome she comprized,  
> Well as she might, and to the Goddesse rose,  
> Whiles all her Nymphes did like a girlond her enclose.
>
> Goodly she gan faire *Cytherea* greet,  
> And shortly asked her, what cause her brought  
> Into that wildernesse for her vnmeet,  
> From her sweet bowres, and beds with pleasures fraught:  
> That suddein change she strange aduenture thought.  
> To whom halfe weeping, she thus answered,  
> That she her dearest sonne *Cupido* sought,  
> Who in his frowardnesse from her was fled;  
> That she repented sore, to haue him angered.
>
> Thereat *Diana* gan to smile, in scorne  
> Of her vaine plaint, and to her scoffing sayd;  
> Great pittie sure, that ye be so forlorne  
> Of your gay sonne, that giues ye so good ayd  
> To your disports: ill mote ye bene apayd.  
> But she was more engrieued, and replide;  
> Faire sister, ill beseemes it to vpbrayd  
> A dolefull heart with so disdainfull pride;  
> The like that mine, may be your paine another tide.
>
> As you in woods and wanton wildernesse  
> Your glory set, to chace the saluage beasts,  
> So my delight is all in ioyfulnesse,  
> In beds, in bowres, in banckets, and in feasts:  
> And ill becomes you with your loftie creasts,  
> To scorne the ioy, that *Ioue* is glad to seeke;  
> We both are bound to follow heauens beheasts,  
> And tend our charges with obeisance meeke:  
> Spare, gentle sister, with reproch my paine to eeke.
>
> And tell me, if that ye my sonne haue heard,  
> To lurke emongst your Nymphes in secret wize;  
> Or keepe their cabins: much I am affeard,  
> Least he like one of them him selfe disguize,  
> And turne his arrowes to their exercize:  
> So may he long himselfe full easie hide:  
> For he is faire and fresh in face and guize,  
> As any Nymph (let not it be enuyde,)  
> So saying euery Nymph full narrowly she eyde.
>
> But *Phoebe* therewith sore was angered,  
> And sharply said; Goe Dame, goe seeke your boy,  
> Where you him lately left, in *Mars* his bed;  
> He comes not here, we scorne his foolish ioy,  
> Ne lend we leisure to his idle toy:  
> But if I catch him in this company,  
> By *Stygian* lake I vow, whose sad annoy  
> The Gods doe dread, he dearely shall abye:  
> Ile clip his wanton wings, that he no more shall fly.
>
> Whom when as *Venus* saw so sore displeased,  
> She inly sory was, and gan relent,  
> What she had said: so her she soone appeased,  
> With sugred words and gentle blandishment,  
> Which as a fountaine from her sweet lips went,  
> And welled goodly forth, that in short space  
> She was well pleasd, and forth her damzels sent,  
> Through all the woods, to search from place to place,  
> If any tract of him or tydings they mote trace.
>
> To search the God of loue, her Nymphes she sent  
> Throughout the wandring forrest euery where:  
> And after them her selfe eke with her went  
> To seeke the fugitiue, both farre and nere,  
> So long they sought, till they arriued were  
> In that same shadie couert, whereas lay  
> Faire *Crysogone* in slombry traunce whilere:  
> Who in her sleepe (a wondrous thing to say)  
> Vnwares had borne two babes, as faire as springing day.
>
> Vnwares she them conceiu'd, vnwares she bore:  
> She bore withouten paine, that she conceiued  
> Withouten pleasure: ne her need implore  
> *Lucinaes* aide: which when they both perceiued,  
> They were through wonder nigh of sense bereaued,  
> And gazing each on other, nought bespake:  
> At last they both agreed, her seeming grieued  
> Out of her heauy swowne not to awake,  
> But from her louing side the tender babes to take.
>
> Vp they them tooke, each one a babe vptooke,  
> And with them carried, to be fostered;  
> Dame *Phoebe* to a Nymph her babe betooke,  
> To be vpbrought in perfect Maydenhed,  
> And of her selfe her name *Belphoebe* red:  
> But *Venus* hers thence farre away conuayd,  
> To be vpbrought in goodly womanhed,  
> And in her litle loues stead, which was strayd,  
> Her *Amoretta* cald, to comfort her dismayd.
>
> She brought her to her ioyous Paradize,  
> Where most she wonnes, whẽ she on earth does dwel.  
> So faire a place, as Nature can deuize:  
> Whether in *Paphos*, or *Cytheron* hill,  
> Or it in *Gnidus* be, I wote not well;  
> But well I wote by tryall, that this same  
> All other pleasant places doth excell,  
> And called is by her lost louers name,  
> The *Gardin* of *Adonis*, farre renowmd by fame.
>
> In that same Gardin all the goodly flowres,  
> Wherewith dame Nature doth her beautifie,  
> And decks the girlonds of her paramoures,  
> Are fetcht: there is the first seminarie  
> Of all things, that are borne to liue and die,  
> According to their kindes. Long worke it were,  
> Here to account the endlesse progenie  
> Of all the weedes, that bud and blossome there;  
> But so much as doth need, must needs be counted here.
>
> It sited was in fruitfull soyle of old,  
> And girt in with two walles on either side;  
> The one of yron, the other of bright gold,  
> That none might thorough breake, nor ouer-stride:  
> And double gates it had, which opened wide,  
> By which both in and out men moten pas;  
> Th'one faire and fresh, the other old and dride:  
> Old *Genius* the porter of them was,  
> Old *Genius*, the which a double nature has.
>
> He letteth in, he letteth out to wend,  
> All that to come into the world desire;  
> A thousand thousand naked babes attend  
> About him day and night, which doe require,  
> That he with fleshly weedes would them attire:  
> Such as him list, such as eternall fate  
> Ordained hath, he clothes with sinfull mire,  
> And sendeth forth to liue in mortall state,  
> Till they againe returne backe by the hinder gate.
>
> After that they againe returned beene,  
> They in that Gardin planted be againe;  
> And grow afresh, as they had neuer seene  
> Fleshly corruption, nor mortall paine.  
> Some thousand yeares so doen they there remaine;  
> And then of him are clad with other hew,  
> Or sent into the chaungefull world againe,  
> Till thither they returne, where first they grew:  
> So like a wheele around they runne from old to new.
>
> Ne needs there Gardiner to set, or sow,  
> To plant or prune: for of their owne accord  
> All things, as they created were, doe grow,  
> And yet remember well the mightie word,  
> Which first was spoken by th'Almightie lord,  
> That bad them to increase and multiply:  
> Ne doe they need with water of the ford,  
> Or of the clouds to moysten their roots dry;  
> For in themselues eternall moisture they imply.
>
> Infinite shapes of creatures there are bred,  
> And vncouth formes, which none yet euer knew,  
> And euery sort is in a sundry bed  
> Set by it selfe, and ranckt in comely rew:  
> Some fit for reasonable soules t'indew,  
> Some made for beasts, some made for birds to weare,  
> And all the fruitfull spawne of fishes hew  
> In endlesse rancks along enraunged were,  
> That seem'd the *Ocean* could not containe them there.
>
> Daily they grow, and daily forth are sent  
> Into the world, it to replenish more;  
> Yet is the stocke not lessened, nor spent,  
> But still remaines in euerlasting store,  
> As it at first created was of yore.  
> For in the wide wombe of the world there lyes,  
> In hatefull darkenesse and in deepe horrore,  
> An huge eternall *Chaos*, which supplyes  
> The substances of natures fruitfull progenyes.
>
> All things from thence doe their first being fetch,  
> And borrow matter, whereof they are made,  
> Which when as forme and feature it does ketch,  
> Becomes a bodie, and doth then inuade  
> The state of life, out of the griesly shade.  
> That substance is eterne, and bideth so,  
> Ne when the life decayes, and forme does fade,  
> Doth it consume, and into nothing go,  
> But chaunged is, and often altred to and fro.
>
> The substance is not chaunged, nor altered,  
> But th'only forme and outward fashion;  
> For euery substance is conditioned  
> To change her hew, and sundry formes to don,  
> Meet for her temper and complexion:  
> For formes are variable and decay,  
> By course of kind, and by occasion;  
> And that faire flowre of beautie fades away,  
> As doth the lilly fresh before the sunny ray.
>
> Great enimy to it, and to all the rest,  
> That in the *Gardin* of *Adonis* springs,  
> Is wicked *Time*, who with his scyth addrest,  
> Does mow the flowring herbes and goodly things,  
> And all their glory to the ground downe flings,  
> Where they doe wither, and are fowly mard:  
> He flyes about, and with his flaggy wings  
> Beates downe both leaues and buds without regard,  
> Ne euer pittie may relent his malice hard.
>
> Yet pittie often did the gods relent,  
> To see so faire things mard, and spoyled quight:  
> And their great mother *Venus* did lament  
> The losse of her deare brood, her deare delight:  
> Her hart was pierst with pittie at the sight,  
> When walking through the Gardin, them she spyde,  
> Yet no'te she find redresse for such despight.  
> For all that liues, is subiect to that law:  
> All things decay in time, and to their end do draw.
>
> But were it not, that *Time* their troubler is,  
> All that in this delightfull Gardin growes,  
> Should happie be, and haue immortall blis:  
> For here all plentie, and all pleasure flowes,  
> And sweet loue gentle fits emongst them throwes,  
> Without fell rancor, or fond gealosie;  
> Franckly each paramour his leman knowes,  
> Each bird his mate, ne any does enuie  
> Their goodly meriment, and gay felicitie.
>
> There is continuall spring, and haruest there  
> Continuall, both meeting at one time:  
> For both the boughes doe laughing blossomes beare,  
> And with fresh colours decke the wanton Prime,  
> And eke attonce the heauy trees they clime,  
> Which seeme to labour vnder their fruits lode:  
> The whiles the ioyous birdes make their pastime  
> Emongst the shadie leaues, their sweet abode,  
> And their true loues without suspition tell abrode.
>
> Right in the middest of that Paradise,  
> There stood a stately Mount, on whose round top  
> A gloomy groue of mirtle trees did rise,  
> Whose shadie boughes sharpe steele did neuer lop,  
> Nor wicked beasts their tender buds did crop,  
> But like a girlond compassed the hight,  
> And from their fruitfull sides sweet gum did drop,  
> That all the ground with precious deaw bedight,  
> Threw forth most dainty odours, & most sweet delight.
>
> And in the thickest couert of that shade,  
> There was a pleasant arbour, not by art,  
> But of the trees owne inclination made,  
> Which knitting their rancke braunches part to part,  
> With wanton yuie twyne entrayld athwart,  
> And Eglantine, and Caprifole emong,  
> Fashiond aboue within their inmost part,  
> That nether *Phoebus* beams could through thẽ throng,  
> Nor *Aeolus* sharp blast could worke them any wrong.
>
> And all about grew euery sort of flowre,  
> To which sad louers were transformd of yore;  
> Fresh *Hyacinthus*, *Phoebus* paramoure,  
> And dearest loue:  
> Foolish *Narcisse*, that likes the watry shore,  
> Sad *Amaranthus*, made a flowre but late,  
> Sad *Amaranthus*, in whose purple gore  
> Me seemes I see *Amintas* wretched fate,  
> To whom sweet Poets verse hath giuen endlesse date.
>
> There wont faire *Venus* often to enioy  
> Her deare *Adonis* ioyous company,  
> And reape sweet pleasure of the wanton boy;  
> There yet, some say, in secret he does ly,  
> Lapped in flowres and pretious spycery,  
> By her hid from the world, and from the skill  
> Of *Stygian* Gods, which doe her loue enuy;  
> But she her selfe, when euer that she will,  
> Possesseth him, and of his sweetnesse takes her fill.
>
> And sooth it seemes they say: for he may not  
> For euer die, and euer buried bee  
> In balefull night, where all things are forgot;  
> All be he subiect to mortalitie,  
> Yet is eterne in mutabilitie,  
> And by succession made perpetuall,  
> Transformed oft, and chaunged diuerslie:  
> For him the Father of all formes they call;  
> Therefore needs mote he liue, that liuing giues to all.
>
> There now he liueth in eternall blis,  
> Ioying his goddesse, and of her enioyd:  
> Ne feareth he henceforth that foe of his,  
> Which with his cruell tuske him deadly cloyd:  
> For that wilde Bore, the which him once annoyd,  
> She firmely hath emprisoned for ay,  
> That her sweet loue his malice mote auoyd,  
> In a strong rocky Caue, which is they say,  
> Hewen vnderneath that Mount, that none him losen may.
>
> There now he liues in euerlasting ioy,  
> With many of the Gods in company,  
> Which thither haunt, and with the winged boy  
> Sporting himselfe in safe felicity:  
> Who when he hath with spoiles and cruelty  
> Ransackt the world, and in the wofull harts  
> Of many wretches set his triumphes hye,  
> Thither resorts, and laying his sad darts  
> Aside, with faire *Adonis* playes his wanton parts.
>
> And his true loue faire *Psyche* with him playes,  
> Faire *Psyche* to him lately reconcyld,  
> After long troubles and vnmeet vpbrayes,  
> With which his mother *Venus* her reuyld,  
> And eke himselfe her cruelly exyld:  
> But now in stedfast loue and happy state  
> She with him liues, and hath him borne a chyld,  
> *Pleasure*, that doth both gods and men aggrate,  
> *Pleasure*, the daughter of *Cupid* and *Psyche* late.
>
> Hither great *Venus* brought this infant faire,  
> The younger daughter of *Chrysogonee*,  
> And vnto *Psyche* with great trust and care  
> Committed her, yfostered to bee,  
> And trained vp in true feminitee:  
> Who no lesse carefully her tendered,  
> Then her owne daughter *Pleasure*, to whom shee  
> Made her companion, and her lessoned  
> In all the lore of loue, and goodly womanhead.
>
> In which when she to perfect ripenesse grew,  
> Of grace and beautie noble Paragone,  
> She brought her forth into the worldes vew,  
> To be th'ensample of true loue alone,  
> And Lodestarre of all chaste affectione,  
> To all faire Ladies, that doe liue on ground.  
> To Faery court she came, where many one  
> Admyrd her goodly haueour, and found  
> His feeble hart wide launched with loues cruell wound.
>
> But she to none of them her loue did cast,  
> Saue to the noble knight Sir *Scudamore*,  
> To whom her louing hart she linked fast  
> In faithfull loue, t'abide for euer more,  
> And for his dearest sake endured sore,  
> Sore trouble of an hainous enimy;  
> Who her would forced haue to haue forlore  
> Her former loue, and stedfast loialty,  
> As ye may elsewhere read that ruefull history.
>
> But well I weene, ye first desire to learne,  
> What end vnto that fearefull Damozell,  
> Which fled so fast from that same foster stearne,  
> Whom with his brethren *Timias* slew, befell:  
> That was to weet, the goodly *Florimell*;  
> Who wandring for to seeke her louer deare,  
> Her louer deare, her dearest *Marinell*,  
> Into misfortune fell, as ye did heare,  
> And from Prince *Arthur* fled with wings of idle feare.
