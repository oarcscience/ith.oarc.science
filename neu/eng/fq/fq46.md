*Cant. VII.*

> *Amoret rapt by greedie lust  
> Belphebe saues from dread:  
> The Squire her loues, and being blam'd  
> his dayes in dole doth lead.*

> G Reat God of loue, that with thy cruell darts,  
> Doest conquer greatest conquerors on ground,  
> And setst thy kingdome in the captiue harts  
> Of Kings and Keasars, to thy seruice bound,  
> What glorie, or what guerdon hast thou found  
> In feeble Ladies tyranning so sore;  
> And adding anguish to the bitter wound,  
> With which their liues thou lanchedst long afore,  
> By heaping stormes of trouble on them daily more?
>
> So whylome didst thou to faire *Florimell*;  
> And so and so to noble *Britomart*:  
> So doest thou now to her, of whom I tell,  
> The louely *Amoret*, whose gentle hart  
> Thou martyrest with sorow and with smart,  
> In saluage forrests, and in deserts wide,  
> With Beares and Tygers taking heauie part,  
> Withouten comfort, and withouten guide,  
> That pittie is to heare the perils, which she tride.
>
> So soone as she with that braue Britonesse  
> Had left that Turneyment for beauties prise,  
> They trauel'd long, that now for wearinesse,  
> Both of the way, and warlike exercise,  
> Both through a forest ryding did deuise  
> T'alight, and rest their wearie limbs awhile.  
> There heauie sleepe the eye-lids did surprise  
> Of *Britomart* after long tedious toyle,  
> That did her passed paines in quiet rest assoyle.
>
> The whiles faire *Amoret*, of nought affeard,  
> Walkt through the wood, for pleasure, or for need;  
> When suddenly behind her backe she heard  
> One rushing forth out of the thickest weed,  
> That ere she backe could turne to taken heed,  
> Had vnawares her snatched vp from ground.  
> Feebly she shriekt, but so feebly indeed,  
> That *Britomart* heard not the shrilling sound,  
> There where through weary trauel she lay sleeping sou˜d.
>
> It was to weet a wilde and saluage man,  
> Yet was no man, but onely like in shape,  
> And eke in stature higher by a span,  
> All ouergrowne with haire, that could awhape  
> An hardy hart, and his wide mouth did gape  
> With huge great teeth, like to a tusked Bore:  
> For he liu'd all on rauin and on rape  
> Of men and beasts; and fed on fleshly gore,  
> The signe whereof yet stain'd his bloudy lips afore.
>
> His neather lip was not like man nor beast,  
> But like a wide deepe poke, downe hanging low,  
> In which he wont the relickes of his feast,  
> And cruell spoyle, which he had spard, to stow:  
> And ouer it his huge great nose did grow,  
> Full dreadfully empurpled all with bloud;  
> And downe both sides two wide long eares did glow,  
> And raught downe to his waste, when vp he stood,  
> More great then th'eares of Elephants by *Indus* flood.
>
> His wast was with a wreath of yuie greene  
> Engirt about, ne other garment wore:  
> For all his haire was like a garment seene;  
> And in his hand a tall young oake he bore,  
> Whose knottie snags were sharpned all afore,  
> And beath'd in fire for steele to be in sted.  
> But whence he was, or of what wombe ybore,  
> Of beasts, or of the earth, I haue not red:  
> But certes was with milke of Wolues and Tygres fed.
>
> This vgly creature in his armes her snatcht,  
> And through the forrest bore her quite away,  
> With briers and bushes all to rent and scratcht;  
> Ne care he had, ne pittie of the pray,  
> Which many a knight had sought so many a day.  
> He stayed not, but in his armes her bearing  
> Ran, till he came to th'end of all his way,  
> Vnto his caue farre from all peoples hearing,  
> And there he threw her in, nought feeling, ne nought fearing.
>
> For she deare Ladie all the way was dead,  
> Whilest he in armes her bore; but when she felt  
> Her selfe downe soust, she waked out of dread  
> Streight into griefe, that her deare hart nigh swelt,  
> And eft gan into tender teares to melt.  
> Then when she lookt about, and nothing found  
> But darknesse and dread horrour, where she dwelt,  
> She almost fell againe into a swound,  
> Ne wist whether aboue she were, or vnder ground.
>
> With that she heard some one close by her side  
> Sighing and sobbing sore, as if the paine  
> Her tender hart in peeces would diuide:  
> Which she long listning, softly askt againe  
> What mister wight it was that so did plaine?  
> To whom thus aunswer'd was: Ah wretched wight  
> That seekes to know anothers griefe in vaine,  
> Vnweeting of thine owne like haplesse plight:  
> Selfe to forget to mind another, is ouersight.
>
> Aye me (said she) where am I, or with whom?  
> Emong the liuing, or emong the dead?  
> What shall of me vnhappy maid become?  
> Shall death be th'end, or ought else worse, aread.  
> Vnhappy mayd (then answerd she) whose dread  
> Vntride, is lesse then when thou shalt it try:  
> Death is to him, that wretched life doth lead,  
> Both grace and gaine; but he in hell doth lie,  
> That liues a loathed life, and wishing cannot die.
>
> This dismall day hath thee a caytiue made,  
> And vassall to the vilest wretch aliue,  
> Whose cursed vsage and vngodly trade  
> The heauens abhorre, and into darkenesse driue.  
> For on the spoile of women he doth liue,  
> Whose bodies chast, when euer in his powre  
> He may them catch, vnable to gainestriue,  
> He with his shamefull lust doth first deflowre,  
> And afterwards themselues doth cruelly deuoure.
>
> Now twenty daies, by which the sonnes of men  
> Diuide their works, haue past through heuen sheene,  
> Since I was brought into this dolefull den;  
> During which space these sory eies haue seen  
> Seauen women by him slaine, and eaten clene.  
> And now no more for him but I alone,  
> And this old woman here remaining beene;  
> Till thou cam'st hither to augment our mone,  
> And of vs three to morrow he will sure eate one.
>
> Ah dreadfull tidings which thou doest declare,  
> (Quoth she) of all that euer hath bene knowen:  
> Full many great calamities and rare  
> This feeble brest endured hath, but none  
> Equall to this, where euer I haue gone.  
> But what are you, whom like vnlucky lot  
> Hath linckt with me in the same chaine attone?  
> To tell (quoth she) that which ye see, needs not;  
> A wofull wretched maid, of God and man forgot.
>
> But what I was, it irkes me to reherse  
> Daughter vnto a Lord of high degree;  
> That ioyd in happy peace, till fates peruerse  
> With guilefull loue did secretly agree,  
> To ouerthrow my state and dignitie.  
> It was my lot to loue a gentle swaine,  
> Yet was he but a Squire of low degree;  
> Yet was he meet, vnlesse mine eye did faine,  
> By any Ladies side for Leman to haue laine.
>
> But for his meannesse and disparagement,  
> My Sire, who me too dearely well did loue,  
> Vnto my choise by no meanes would assent,  
> But often did my folly fowle reproue.  
> Yet nothing could my fixed mind remoue,  
> But whether willed or nilled friend or foe,  
> I me resolu'd the vtmost end to proue,  
> And rather then my loue abandon so,  
> Both sire, and friends, and all for euer to forego.
>
> Thenceforth I sought by secret meanes to worke  
> Time to my will, and from his wrathfull sight  
> To hide th'intent, which in my heart did lurke,  
> Till I thereto had all things ready dight.  
> So on a day vnweeting vnto wight,  
> I with that Squire agreede away to flit,  
> And in a priuy place, betwixt vs hight,  
> Within a groue appointed him to meete;  
> To which I boldly came vpon my feeble feete.
>
> But ah vnhappy houre me thither brought:  
> For in that place where I him thought to find,  
> There was I found, contrary to my thought,  
> Of this accursed Carle of hellish kind;  
> The shame of men, and plague of womankind,  
> Who trussing me, as Eagle doth his pray,  
> Me hether brought with him, as swift as wind,  
> Where yet vntouched till this present day,  
> I rest his wretched thrall, the sad *AEmylia*.
>
> Ah sad *AEmylia* (then sayd *Amoret*,)  
> Thy ruefull plight I pitty as mine owne.  
> But read to me, by what deuise or wit,  
> Hast thou in all this time, from him vnknowne  
> Thine honor sau'd, though into thraldome throwne?  
> Through helpe (quoth she) of this old woman here  
> I haue so done, as she to me hath showne.  
> For euer when he burnt in lustfull fire,  
> She in my stead supplide his bestiall desire.
>
> Thus of their euils as they did discourse,  
> And each did other much bewaile and mone;  
> Loe where the villaine selfe, their sorrowes sourse,  
> Came to the caue, and rolling thence the stone,  
> Which wont to stop the mouth thereof, that none  
> Might issue forth, came rudely rushing in,  
> And spredding ouer all the flore alone,  
> Gan dight him selfe vnto his wonted sinne;  
> Which ended, then his bloudy banket should beginne.
>
> Which when as fearefull *Amoret* perceiued,  
> She staid not the vtmost end thereof to try,  
> But like a ghastly Gelt, whose wits are reaued,  
> Ran forth in hast with hideous outcry,  
> For horrour of his shamefull villany.  
> But after her full lightly he vprose,  
> And her pursu'd as fast as she did flie:  
> Full fast she flies, and farre afore him goes,  
> Ne feeles the thorns and thickets pricke her tender toes.
>
> Nor hedge, nor ditch, nor hill, nor dale she staies,  
> But ouerleapes them all, like Robucke light,  
> And through the thickest makes her nighest waies;  
> And euermore when with regardfull sight  
> She looking backe, espies that griesly wight  
> Approching nigh, she gins to mend her pace,  
> And makes her feare a spur to hast her flight:  
> More swift then *Myrrh'* or *Daphne* in her race,  
> Or any of the Thracian Nimphes in saluage chase.
>
> Long so she fled, and so he follow'd long;  
> Ne liuing aide for her on earth appeares,  
> But if the heauens helpe to redresse her wrong,  
> Moued with pity of her plenteous teares.  
> It fortuned *Belphebe* with her peares  
> The woody Nimphs, and with that louely boy,  
> Was hunting then the Libbards and the Beares,  
> In these wild woods, as was her wonted ioy,  
> To banish sloth, that oft doth noble mindes annoy.
>
> It so befell, as oft it fals in chace,  
> That each of them from other sundred were,  
> And that same gentle Squire arriu'd in place,  
> Where this same cursed caytiue did appeare,  
> Pursuing that faire Lady full of feare;  
> And now he her quite ouertaken had;  
> And now he her away with him did beare  
> Vnder his arme, as seeming wondrous glad,  
> That by his grenning laughter mote farre off be rad.
>
> Which drery sight the gentle Squire espying,  
> Doth hast to crosse him by the nearest way,  
> Led with that wofull Ladies piteous crying,  
> And him assailes with all the might he may:  
> Yet will not he the louely spoile downe lay,  
> But with his craggy club in his right hand,  
> Defends him selfe, and saues his gotten pray.  
> Yet had it bene right hard him to withstand,  
> But that he was full light and nimble on the land.
>
> Thereto the villaine vsed craft in fight;  
> For euer when the Squire his iauelin shooke,  
> He held the Lady forth before him right,  
> And with her body, as a buckler, broke  
> The puissance of his intended stroke.  
> And if it chaunst, (as needs it must in fight)  
> Whilest he on him was greedy to be wroke,  
> That any little blow on her did light,  
> Then would he laugh aloud, and gather great delight.
>
> Which subtill sleight did him encumber much,  
> And made him oft, when he would strike, forbeare;  
> For hardly could he come the carle to touch,  
> But that he her must hurt, or hazard neare:  
> Yet he his hand so carefully did beare,  
> That at the last he did himselfe attaine,  
> And therein left the pike head of his speare.  
> A streame of coleblacke bloud thence gusht amaine,  
> That all her silken garments did with bloud bestaine.
>
> With that he threw her rudely on the flore,  
> And laying both his hands vpon his glaue,  
> With dreadfull strokes let driue at him so sore,  
> That forst him flie abacke, himselfe to saue:  
> Yet he therewith so felly still did raue,  
> That scarse the Squire his hand could once vpreare,  
> But for aduantage ground vnto him gaue,  
> Tracing and trauersing, now here, now there;  
> For bootlesse thing it was to think such blowes to beare.
>
> Whilest thus in battell they embusied were,  
> *Belphebe* raunging in that forrest wide,  
> The hideous noise of their huge strokes did heare,  
> And drew thereto, making her eare her guide.  
> Whom when that theefe approching nigh espide,  
> With bow in hand, and arrowes ready bent,  
> He by his former combate would not bide,  
> But fled away with ghastly dreriment,  
> Well knowing her to be his deaths sole instrument.
>
> Whom seeing flie, she speedily poursewed  
> With winged feete, as nimble as the winde;  
> And euer in her bow she ready shewed  
> The arrow, to his deadly marke desynde,  
> As when *Latonaes* daughter cruell kynde,  
> In vengement of her mothers great disgrace,  
> With fell despight her cruell arrowes tynde  
> Gainst wofull *Niobes* vnhappy race,  
> That all the gods did mone her miserable case.
>
> So well she sped her and so far she ventred,  
> That ere vnto his hellish den he raught,  
> Euen as he ready was there to haue entred,  
> She sent an arrow forth with mighty draught,  
> That in the very dore him ouercaught,  
> And in his nape arriuing, through it thrild  
> His greedy throte, therewith in two distraught,  
> That all his vitall spirites thereby spild,  
> And all his hairy brest with gory bloud was fild.
>
> Whom when on ground she groueling saw to rowle,  
> She ran in hast his life to haue bereft:  
> But ere she could him reach, the sinfull sowle  
> Hauing his carrion corse quite sencelesse left,  
> Was fled to hell, surcharg'd with spoile and theft.  
> Yet ouer him she there long gazing stood,  
> And oft admir'd his monstrous shape, and oft  
> His mighty limbs, whilest all with filthy bloud  
> The place there ouerflowne, seemd like a sodaine flood.
>
> Thence forth she past into his dreadfull den,  
> Where nought but darkesome drerinesse she found,  
> Ne creature saw, but hearkned now and then  
> Some litle whispering, and soft groning sound.  
> With that she askt, what ghosts there vnder ground  
> Lay hid in horrour of eternall night?  
> And bad them, if so be they were not bound,  
> To come and shew themselues before the light,  
> Now freed from feare and danger of that dismall wight.
>
> Then forth the sad *AEmylia* issewed,  
> Yet trembling euery ioynt through former feare;  
> And after her the Hag, there with her mewed,  
> A foule and lothsome creature did appeare;  
> A leman fit for such a louer deare.  
> That mou'd *Belphebe* her no lesse to hate,  
> Then for to rue the others heauy cheare;  
> Of whom she gan enquire of her estate.  
> Who all to her at large, as hapned, did relate.
>
> Thence she them brought toward the place, where late  
> She left the gentle Squire with *Amoret:*  
> There she him found by that new louely mate,  
> Who lay the whiles in swoune, full sadly set,  
> From her faire eyes wiping the deawy wet,  
> Which softly stild, and kissing them atweene,  
> And handling soft the hurts, which she did get.  
> For of that Carle she sorely bruz'd had beene,  
> Als of his owne rash hand one wound was to be seene.
>
> Which when she saw, with sodaine glauncing eye,  
> Her noble heart with sight thereof was fild  
> With deepe disdaine, and great indignity,  
> That in her wrath she thought them both haue thrild,  
> With that selfe arrow, which the Carle had kild:  
> Yet held her wrathfull hand from vengeance sore,  
> But drawing nigh, ere he her well beheld;  
> Is this the faith, she said, and said no more,  
> But turnd her face, and fled away for euermore.
>
> He seeing her depart, arose vp light,  
> Right sore agrieued at her sharpe reproofe,  
> And follow'd fast: but when he came in sight,  
> He durst not nigh approch, but kept aloofe,  
> For dread of her displeasures vtmost proofe.  
> And euermore, when he did grace entreat,  
> And framed speaches fit for his behoofe,  
> Her mortall arrowes she at him did threat,  
> And forst him backe with fowle dishonor to retreat.
>
> At last when long he follow'd had in vaine,  
> Yet found no ease of griefe, nor hope of grace,  
> Vnto those woods he turned backe againe,  
> Full of sad anguish, and in heauy case:  
> And finding there fit solitary place  
> For wofull wight, chose out a gloomy glade,  
> Where hardly eye mote see bright heauens face,  
> For mossy trees, which couered all with shade  
> And sad melancholy: there he his cabin made.
>
> His wonted warlike weapons all he broke,  
> And threw away, with vow to vse no more,  
> Ne thenceforth euer strike in battell stroke,  
> Ne euer word to speake to woman more;  
> But in that wildernesse, of men forlore,  
> And of the wicked world forgotten quight,  
> His hard mishap in dolor to deplore,  
> And wast his wretched daies in wofull plight;  
> So on him selfe to wreake his follies owne despight.
>
> And eke his garment, to be thereto meet,  
> He wilfully did cut and shape anew;  
> And his faire lockes, that wont with ointment sweet  
> To be embaulm'd, and sweat out dainty dew,  
> He let to grow and griesly to concrew,  
> Vncomb'd, vncurl'd, and carelesly vnshed;  
> That in short time his face they ouergrew,  
> And ouer all his shoulders did dispred,  
> That who he whilome was, vneath was to be red.
>
> There he continued in this carefull plight,  
> Wretchedly wearing out his youthly yeares,  
> Through wilfull penury consumed quight,  
> That like a pined ghost he soone appeares.  
> For other food then that wilde forrest beares,  
> Ne other drinke there did he euer tast,  
> Then running water, tempred with his teares,  
> The more his weakened body so to wast:  
> That out of all mens knowledge he was worne at last.
>
> For on a day, by fortune as it fell,  
> His owne deare Lord Prince *Arthure* came that way,  
> Seeking aduentures, where he mote heare tell;  
> And as he through the wandring wood did stray,  
> Hauing espide this Cabin far away,  
> He to it drew, to weet who there did wonne;  
> Weening therein some holy Hermit lay,  
> That did resort of sinfull people shonne;  
> Or else some woodman shrowded there from scorching sunne.
>
> Arriuing there, he found this wretched man,  
> Spending his daies in dolour and despaire,  
> And through long fasting woxen pale and wan,  
> All ouergrowen with rude and rugged haire;  
> That albeit his owne deare Squire he were,  
> Yet he him knew not, ne auiz'd at all,  
> But like strange wight, whom he had seene no where,  
> Saluting him, gan into speach to fall,  
> And pitty much his plight, that liu'd like outcast thrall.
>
> But to his speach he aunswered no whit,  
> But stood still mute, as if he had beene dum,  
> Ne signe of sence did shew, ne common wit,  
> As one with griefe and anguishe ouercum,  
> And vnto euery thing did aunswere mum:  
> And euer when the Prince vnto him spake,  
> He louted lowly, as did him becum,  
> And humble homage did vnto him make,  
> Midst sorrow shewing ioyous semblance for his sake.
>
> At which his vncouth guise and vsage quaint  
> The Prince did wonder much, yet could not ghesse  
> The cause of that his sorrowfull constraint;  
> Yet weend by secret signes of manlinesse,  
> Which close appeard in that rude brutishnesse,  
> That he whilome some gentle swaine had beene,  
> Traind vp in feats of armes and knightlinesse;  
> Which he obseru'd, by that he him had seene  
> To weld his naked sword, and try the edges keene.
>
> And eke by that he saw on euery tree,  
> How he the name of one engrauen had,  
> Which likly was his liefest loue to be,  
> For whom he now so sorely was bestad;  
> Which was by him *BELPHEBE* rightly rad.  
> Yet who was that *Belphebe*, he ne wist;  
> Yet saw he often how he wexed glad,  
> When he it heard, and how the ground he kist,  
> Wherein it written was, and how himselfe he blist:
>
> Tho when he long had marked his demeanor,  
> And saw that all he said and did, was vaine,  
> Ne ought mote make him change his wonted tenor,  
> Ne ought mote ease or mitigate his paine,  
> He left him there in languor to remaine,  
> Till time for him should remedy prouide,  
> And him restore to former grace againe.  
> Which for it is too long here to abide,  
> I will deferre the end vntill another tide.
