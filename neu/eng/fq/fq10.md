*Cant. X.*

> *Her faithfull knight faire Vna brings  
> to house of Holinesse,  
> Where he is taught repentance, and  
> the way to heauenly blesse.*

> WHat man is he, that boasts of fleshly might,  
> And vaine assurance of mortality,  
> Which all so soone, as it doth come to fight,  
> Against spirituall foes, yeelds by and by,  
> Or from the field most cowardly doth fly?  
> Ne let the man ascribe it to his skill,  
> That thorough grace hath gained victory.  
> If any strength we haue, it is to ill,  
> But all the good is Gods, both power and eke will.
>
> By that, which lately hapned, *Vna* saw,  
> That this her knight was feeble, and too faint;  
> And all his sinews woxen weake and raw,  
> Through long enprisonment, and hard constraint,  
> Which he endured in his late restraint,  
> That yet he was vnfit for bloudie fight:  
> Therefore to cherish him with diets daint,  
> She cast to bring him, where he chearen might,  
> Till he recouered had his late decayed plight.
>
> There was an auntient house not farre away,  
> Renowmd throughout the world for sacred lore,  
> And pure vnspotted life: so well they say  
> It gouernd was, and guided euermore,  
> Through wisedome of a matrone graue and hore;  
> Whose onely ioy was to relieue the needes  
> Of wretched soules, and helpe the helpelesse pore:  
> All night she spent in bidding of her bedes,  
> And all the day in doing good and godly deedes.
>
> Dame *Cælia* men did her call, as thought  
> From heauen to come, or thither to arise,  
> The mother of three daughters, well vpbrought  
> In goodly thewes, and godly exercise:  
> The eldest two most sober, chast, and wise,  
> *Fidelia* and *Speranza* virgins were,  
> Though spousd, yet wanting wedlocks solemnize;  
> But faire *Charissa* to a louely fere  
> Was lincked, and by him had many pledges dere.
>
> Arriued there, the dore they find fast lockt;  
> For it was warely watched night and day,  
> For feare of many foes: but when they knockt,  
> The Porter opened vnto them streight way:  
> He was an aged syre, all hory gray,  
> With lookes full lowly cast, and gate full slow,  
> Wont on a staffe his feeble steps to stay,  
> Hight *Humiltá*. They passe in stouping low;  
> For streight & narrow was the way, which he did show.
>
> Each goodly thing is hardest to begin,  
> But entred in a spacious court they see,  
> Both plaine, and pleasant to be walked in,  
> Where them does meete a francklin faire and free,  
> And entertaines with comely courteous glee,  
> His name was *Zele*, that him right well became,  
> For in his speeches and behauiour hee  
> Did labour liuely to expresse the same,  
> And gladly did them guide, till to the Hall they came.
>
> There fairely them receiues a gentle Squire,  
> Of milde demeanure, and rare courtesie,  
> Right cleanly clad in comely sad attire;  
> In word and deede that shew'd great modestie,  
> And knew his good to all of each degree,  
> Hight *Reuerence*. He them with speeches meet  
> Does faire entreat; no courting nicetie,  
> But simple true, and eke vnfained sweet,  
> As might become a Squire so great persons to greet.
>
> And afterwards them to his Dame he leades,  
> That aged Dame, the Ladie of the place:  
> Who all this while was busie at her beades:  
> Which doen, she vp arose with seemely grace,  
> And toward them full matronely did pace.  
> Where when that fairest *Vna* she beheld,  
> Whom well she knew to spring from heauenly race,  
> Her hart with ioy vnwonted inly sweld,  
> As feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld.
>
> And her embracing said, ô happie earth,  
> Whereon thy innocent feet doe euer tread,  
> Most vertuous virgin borne of heauenly berth,  
> That to redeeme thy woefull parents head,  
> From tyrans rage, and euer-dying dread,  
> Hast wandred through the world now long a day;  
> Yet ceasest not thy wearie soles to lead,  
> What grace hath thee now hither brought this way?  
> Or doen thy feeble feet vnweeting hither stray?
>
> Strange thing it is an errant knight to see  
> Here in this place, or any other wight,  
> That hither turnes his steps. So few there bee,  
> That chose the narrow path, or seeke the right:  
> All keepe the broad high way, and take delight  
> With many rather for to go astray,  
> And be partakers of their euill plight,  
> Then with a few to walke the rightest way;  
> O foolish men, why haste ye to your owne decay?
>
> Thy selfe to see, and tyred limbs to rest,  
> O matrone sage (quoth she) I hither came,  
> And this good knight his way with me addrest,  
> Led with thy prayses and broad-blazed fame,  
> That vp to heauen is blowne. The auncient Dame  
> Him goodly greeted in her modest guise,  
> And entertaynd them both, as best became,  
> With all the court'sies, that she could deuise.  
> Ne wanted ought, to shew her bounteous or wise.
>
> Thus as they gan of sundry things deuise,  
> Loe two most goodly virgins came in place,  
> Ylinked arme in arme in louely wise,  
> With countenance demure, and modest grace,  
> They numberd euen steps and equall pace:  
> Of which the eldest, that *Fidelia* hight,  
> Like sunny beames threw from her Christall face,  
> That could haue dazd the rash beholders sight,  
> And round about her head did shine like heauens light.
>
> She was araied all in lilly white,  
> And in her right hand bore a cup of gold,  
> With wine and water fild vp to the hight,  
> In which a Serpent did himselfe enfold,  
> That horrour made to all, that did behold;  
> But she no whit did chaunge her constant mood:  
> And in her other hand she fast did hold  
> A booke, that was both signd and seald with blood,  
> Wherein darke things were writ, hard to be vnderstood.
>
> Her younger sister, that *Speranza* hight,  
> Was clad in blew, that her beseemed well;  
> Not all so chearefull seemed she of sight,  
> As was her sister; whether dread did dwell,  
> Or anguish in her hart, is hard to tell:  
> Vpon her arme a siluer anchor lay,  
> Whereon she leaned euer, as befell:  
> And euer vp to heauen, as she did pray,  
> Her stedfast eyes were bent, ne swarued other way.
>
> They seeing *Vna*, towards her gan wend,  
> Who them encounters with like courtesie;  
> Many kind speeches they betwene them spend,  
> And greatly ioy each other well to see:  
> Then to the knight with shamefast modestie  
> They turne themselues, at *Vnaes* meeke request,  
> And him salute with well beseeming glee:  
> Who faire them quites, as him beseemed best,  
> And goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest.
>
> Then *Vna* thus; But she your sister deare;  
> The deare *Charissa* where is she become?  
> Or wants she health, or busie is elsewhere?  
> Ah no, said they, but forth she may not come:  
> For she of late is lightned of her wombe,  
> And hath encreast the world with one sonne more,  
> That her to see should be but troublesome.  
> Indeede (quoth she) that should her trouble sore,  
> But thankt be God, and her encrease so euermore.
>
> Then said the aged *Coelia*, Deare dame,  
> And you good Sir, I wote that of your toyle,  
> And labours long, through which ye hither came,  
> Ye both forwearied be: therefore a whyle  
> I read you rest, and to your bowres recoyle.  
> Then called she a Groome, that forth him led  
> Into a goodly lodge, and gan despoile  
> Of puissant armes, and laid in easie bed;  
> His name was meeke *Obedience* rightfully ared.
>
> Now when their wearie limbes with kindly rest,  
> And bodies were refresht with due repast,  
> Faire *Vna* gan *Fidelia* faire request,  
> To haue her knight into her schoolehouse plaste,  
> That of her heauenly learning he might taste,  
> And heare the wisedome of her words diuine.  
> She graunted, and that knight so much agraste,  
> That she him taught celestiall discipline,  
> And opened his dull eyes, that light mote in them shine.
>
> And that her sacred Booke, with bloud ywrit,  
> That none could read, except she did them teach,  
> She vnto him disclosed euery whit,  
> And heauenly documents thereout did preach,  
> That weaker wit of man could neuer reach,  
> Of God, of grace, of iustice, of free will,  
> That wonder was to heare her goodly speach:  
> For she was able, with her words to kill,  
> And raise againe to life the hart, that she did thrill.
>
> And when she list poure out her larger spright,  
> She would commaund the hastie Sunne to stay,  
> Or backward turne his course from heauens hight;  
> Sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay,  
> Dry-shod to passe, she parts the flouds in tway;  
> And eke huge mountaines from their natiue seat  
> She would commaund, themselues to beare away,  
> And throw in raging sea with roaring threat.  
> Almightie God her gaue such powre, and puissance great.
>
> The faithfull knight now grew in litle space,  
> By hearing her, and by her sisters lore,  
> To such perfection of all heauenly grace,  
> That wretched world he gan for to abhore,  
> And mortall life gan loath, as thing forlore,  
> Greeu'd with remembrance of his wicked wayes,  
> And prickt with anguish of his sinnes so sore,  
> That he desirde to end his wretched dayes:  
> So much the dart of sinfull guilt the soule dismayes.
>
> But wise *Speranza* gaue him comfort sweet,  
> And taught him how to take assured hold  
> Vpon her siluer anchor, as was meet;  
> Else had his sinnes so great, and manifold  
> Made him forget all that *Fidelia* told.  
> In this distressed doubtfull agonie,  
> When him his dearest *Vna* did behold,  
> Disdeining life, desiring leaue to die,  
> She found her selfe assayld with great perplexitie.
>
> And came to *Coelia* to declare her smart,  
> Who well acquainted with that commune plight,  
> Which sinfull horror workes in wounded hart,  
> Her wisely comforted all that she might,  
> With goodly counsell and aduisement right;  
> And streightway sent with carefull diligence,  
> To fetch a Leach, the which had great insight  
> In that disease of grieued conscience,  
> And well could cure the same; His name was *Patience*.
>
> Who comming to that soule-diseased knight,  
> Could hardly him intreat, to tell his griefe:  
> Which knowne, and all that noyd his heauie spright  
> Well searcht, eftsoones he gan apply reliefe  
> Of salues and med'cines, which had passing priefe,  
> And thereto added words of wondrous might:  
> By which to ease he him recured briefe,  
> And much asswag'd the passion of his plight,  
> That he his paine endur'd, as seeming now more light.
>
> But yet the cause and root of all his ill,  
> Inward corruption, and infected sin,  
> Not purg'd nor heald, behind remained still,  
> And festring sore did rankle yet within,  
> Close creeping twixt the marrow and the skin.  
> Which to extirpe, he laid him priuily  
> Downe in a darkesome lowly place farre in,  
> Whereas he meant his corrosiues to apply,  
> And with streight diet tame his stubborne malady.
>
> In ashes and sackcloth he did array  
> His daintie corse, proud humors to abate,  
> And dieted with fasting euery day,  
> The swelling of his wounds to mitigate,  
> And made him pray both earely and eke late:  
> And euer as superfluous flesh did rot  
> *Amendment* readie still at hand did wayt,  
> To pluck it out with pincers firie whot,  
> That soone in him was left no one corrupted iot.
>
> And bitter *Penance* with an yron whip,  
> Was wont him once to disple euery day:  
> And sharpe *Remorse* his hart did pricke and nip,  
> That drops of bloud thence like a well did play;  
> And sad *Repentance* vsed to embay  
> His bodie in salt water smarting sore,  
> The filthy blots of sinne to wash away.  
> So in short space they did to health restore  
> The man that would not liue, but earst lay at deathes dore.
>
> In which his torment often was so great,  
> That like a Lyon he would cry and rore,  
> And rend his flesh, and his owne synewes eat.  
> His owne deare *Vna* hearing euermore  
> His ruefull shriekes and gronings, often tore  
> Her guiltlesse garments, and her golden heare,  
> For pitty of his paine and anguish sore;  
> Yet all with patience wisely she did beare;  
> For well she wist, his crime could else be neuer cleare.
>
> Whom thus recouer'd by wise Patience,  
> And trew *Repentance* they to *Vna* brought:  
> Who ioyous of his cured conscience,  
> Him dearely kist, and fairely eke besought  
> Himselfe to chearish, and consuming thought  
> To put away out of his carefull brest.  
> By this *Charissa*, late in child-bed brought,  
> Was woxen strong, and left her fruitfull nest;  
> To her faire *Vna* brought this vnacquainted guest.
>
> She was a woman in her freshest age,  
> Of wondrous beauty, and of bountie rare,  
> With goodly grace and comely personage,  
> That was on earth not easie to compare;  
> Full of great loue, but *Cupids* wanton snare  
> As hell she hated, chast in worke and will;  
> Her necke and breasts were euer open bare,  
> That ay thereof her babes might sucke their fill;  
> The rest was all in yellow robes arayed still.
>
> A multitude of babes about her hong,  
> Playing their sports, that ioyd her to behold,  
> Whom still she fed, whiles they were weake & young,  
> But thrust them forth still, as they wexed old:  
> And on her head she wore a tyre of gold,  
> Adornd with gemmes and owches wondrous faire,  
> Whose passing price vneath was to be told;  
> And by her side there sate a gentle paire  
> Of turtle doues, she sitting in an yuorie chaire.
>
> The knight and *Vna* entring, faire her greet,  
> And bid her ioy of that her happie brood;  
> Who them requites with court'sies seeming meet,  
> And entertaines with friendly chearefull mood.  
> Then *Vna* her besought, to be so good,  
> As in her vertuous rules to schoole her knight,  
> Now after all his torment well withstood,  
> In that sad house of *Penaunce*, where his spright  
> Had past the paines of hell, and long enduring night.
>
> She was right ioyous of her iust request,  
> And taking by the hand that Faeries sonne,  
> Gan him instruct in euery good behest,  
> Of loue, and righteousnesse, and well to donne,  
> And wrath, and hatred warely to shonne,  
> That drew on men Gods hatred, and his wrath,  
> And many soules in dolours had fordonne:  
> In which when him she well instructed hath,  
> From thence to heauen she teacheth him the ready path.
>
> Wherein his weaker wandring steps to guide,  
> An auncient matrone she to her does call,  
> Whose sober lookes her wisedome well descride:  
> Her name was *Mercie*, well knowne ouer all,  
> To be both gratious, and eke liberall:  
> To whom the carefull charge of him she gaue,  
> To lead aright, that he should neuer fall  
> In all his wayes through this wide worldes waue,  
> That Mercy in the end his righteous soule might saue.
>
> The godly Matrone by the hand him beares  
> Forth from her presence, by a narrow way,  
> Scattred with bushy thornes, and ragged breares,  
> Which still before him she remou'd away,  
> That nothing might his ready passage stay:  
> And euer when his feet encombred were,  
> Or gan to shrinke, or from the right to stray,  
> She held him fast, and firmely did vpbeare,  
> As carefull Nourse her child from falling oft does reare.
>
> Eftsoones vnto an holy Hospitall,  
> That was fore by the way, she did him bring,  
> In which seuen Bead-men that had vowed all  
> Their life to seruice of high heauens king  
> Did spend their dayes in doing godly thing:  
> Their gates to all were open euermore,  
> That by the wearie way were traueiling,  
> And one sate wayting euer them before,  
> To call in-commers by, that needy were and pore.
>
> The first of them that eldest was, and best,  
> Of all the house had charge and gouernement,  
> As Guardian and Steward of the rest:  
> His office was to giue entertainement  
> And lodging, vnto all that came, and went:  
> Not vnto such, as could him feast againe,  
> And double quite, for that he on them spent,  
> But such, as want of harbour did constraine:  
> Those for Gods sake his dewty was to entertaine.
>
> The second was as Almner of the place,  
> His office was, the hungry for to feed,  
> And thristy giue to drinke, a worke of grace:  
> He feard not once him selfe to be in need,  
> Ne car'd to hoord for those, whom he did breede:  
> The grace of God he layd vp still in store,  
> Which as a stocke he left vnto his seede;  
> He had enough, what need him care for more?  
> And had he lesse, yet some he would giue to the pore.
>
> The third had of their wardrobe custodie,  
> In which were not rich tyres, nor garments gay,  
> The plumes of pride, and wings of vanitie,  
> But clothes meet to keepe keene could away,  
> And naked nature seemely to aray;  
> With which bare wretched wights he dayly clad,  
> The images of God in earthly clay;  
> And if that no spare cloths to giue he had,  
> His owne coate he would cut, and it distribute glad.
>
> The fourth appointed by his office was,  
> Poore prisoners to relieue with gratious ayd,  
> And captiues to redeeme with price of bras,  
> From Turkes and Sarazins, which them had stayd;  
> And though they faultie were, yet well he wayd,  
> That God to vs forgiueth euery howre  
> Much more then that, why they in bands were layd,  
> And he that harrowd hell with heauie stowre,  
> The faultie soules from thence brought to his heauenly bowre.
>
> The fift had charge sicke persons to attend,  
> And comfort those, in point of death which lay;  
> For them most needeth comfort in the end,  
> When sin, and hell, and death do most dismay  
> The feeble soule departing hence away.  
> All is but lost, that liuing we bestow,  
> If not well ended at our dying day.  
> O man haue mind of that last bitter throw;  
> For as the tree does fall, so lyes it euer low.
>
> The sixt had charge of them now being dead,  
> In seemely sort their corses to engraue,  
> And deck with dainty flowres their bridall bed,  
> That to their heauenly spouse both sweet and braue  
> They might appeare, when he their soules shall saue.  
> The wondrous workemanship of Gods owne mould,  
> Whose face he made, all beasts to feare, and gaue  
> All in his hand, euen dead we honour should.  
> Ah dearest God me graunt, I dead be not defould.
>
> The seuenth now after death and buriall done,  
> Had charge the tender Orphans of the dead  
> And widowes ayd, least they should be vndone:  
> In face of iudgement he their right would plead,  
> Ne ought the powre of mighty men did dread  
> In their defence, nor would for gold or fee  
> Be wonne their rightfull causes downe to tread:  
> And when they stood in most necessitee,  
> He did supply their want, and gaue them euer free.
>
> There when the Elfin knight arriued was,  
> The first and chiefest of the seuen, whose care  
> Was guests to welcome, towardes him did pas:  
> Where seeing *Mercie*, that his steps vp bare,  
> And alwayes led, to her with reuerence rare  
> He humbly louted in meeke lowlinesse,  
> And seemely welcome for her did prepare:  
> For of their order she was Patronesse,  
> Albe *Charissa* were their chiefest founderesse.
>
> There she awhile him stayes, him selfe to rest,  
> That to the rest more able he might bee:  
> During which time, in euery good behest  
> And godly worke of Almes and charitee  
> She him instructed with great industree;  
> Shortly therein so perfect he became,  
> That from the first vnto the last degree,  
> His mortall life he learned had to frame  
> In holy righteousnesse, without rebuke or blame.
>
> Thence forward by that painfull way they pas,  
> Forth to an hill, that was both steepe and hy;  
> On top whereof a sacred chappell was,  
> And eke a litle Hermitage thereby,  
> Wherein an aged holy man did lye,  
> That day and night said his deuotion,  
> Ne other worldly busines did apply;  
> His name was heauenly *Contemplation*;  
> Of God and goodnesse was his meditation.
>
> Great grace that old man to him giuen had;  
> For God he often saw from heauens hight,  
> All were his earthly eyen both blunt and bad,  
> And through great age had lost their kindly sight,  
> Yet wondrous quick and persant was his spright,  
> As Eagles eye, that can behold the Sunne:  
> That hill they scale with all their powre and might,  
> That his frayle thighes nigh wearie and fordonne  
> Gan faile, but by her helpe the top at last he wonne.
>
> There they do finde that godly aged Sire,  
> With snowy lockes adowne his shoulders shed,  
> As hoarie frost with spangles doth attire  
> The mossy braunches of an Oke halfe ded.  
> Each bone might through his body well be red,  
> And euery sinew seene through his long fast:  
> For nought he car'd his carcas long vnfed;  
> His mind was full of spirituall repast,  
> And pyn'd his flesh, to keepe his body low and chast.
>
> Who when these two approching he aspide,  
> At their first presence grew agrieued sore,  
> That forst him lay his heauenly thoughts aside;  
> And had he not that Dame respected more,  
> Whom highly he did reuerence and adore,  
> He would not once haue moued for the knight.  
> They him saluted standing far afore;  
> Who well them greeting, humbly did requight,  
> And asked, to what end they clomb that tedious height.
>
> What end (quoth she) should cause vs take such paine,  
> But that same end, which euery liuing wight  
> Should make his marke, high heauen to attaine?  
> Is not from hence the way, that leadeth right  
> To that most glorious house, that glistreth bright  
> With burning starres, and euerliuing fire,  
> Whereof the keyes are to thy hand behight  
> By wise *Fidelia*? she doth thee require,  
> To shew it to this knight, according his desire.
>
> Thrise happy man, said then the father graue,  
> Whose staggering steps thy steady hand doth lead,  
> And shewes the way, his sinfull soule to saue.  
> Who better can the way to heauen aread,  
> Then thou thy selfe, that was both borne and bred  
> In heauenly throne, where thousand Angels shine?  
> Thou doest the prayers of the righteous sead  
> Present before the maiestie diuine,  
> And his auenging wrath to clemencie incline.
>
> Yet since thou bidst, thy pleasure shalbe donne.  
> Then come thou man of earth, and see the way,  
> That neuer yet was seene of Faeries sonne,  
> That neuer leads the traueiler astray,  
> But after labours long, and sad delay,  
> Brings them to ioyous rest and endlesse blis.  
> But first thou must a season fast and pray,  
> Till from her bands the spright assoiled is,  
> And haue her strength recur'd from fraile infirmitis.
>
> That done, he leads him to the highest Mount;  
> Such one, as that same mighty man of God,  
> That bloud-red billowes like a walled front  
> On either side disparted with his rod,  
> Till that his army dry-foot through them yod,  
> Dwelt fortie dayes vpon; where writ in stone  
> With bloudy letters by the hand of God,  
> The bitter doome of death and balefull mone  
> He did receiue, whiles flashing fire about him shone.
>
> Or like that sacred hill, whose head full hie,  
> Adornd with fruitfull Oliues all arownd,  
> Is, as it were for endlesse memory  
> Of that deare Lord, who oft thereon was fownd,  
> For euer with a flowring girlond crownd:  
> Or like that pleasaunt Mount, that is for ay  
> Through famous Poets verse each where renownd,  
> On which the thrise three learned Ladies play  
> Their heauenly notes, and make full many a louely lay.
>
> From thence, far off he vnto him did shew  
> A litle path, that was both steepe and long,  
> Which to a goodly Citie led his vew;  
> Whose wals and towres were builded high and strong  
> Of perle and precious stone, that earthly tong  
> Cannot describe, nor wit of man can tell;  
> Too high a ditty for my simple song;  
> The Citie of the great king hight it well,  
> Wherein eternall peace and happinesse doth dwell.
>
> As he thereon stood gazing, he might see  
> The blessed Angels to and fro descend  
> From highest heauen, in gladsome companee,  
> And with great ioy into that Citie wend,  
> As commonly as friend does with his frend.  
> Whereat he wondred much, and gan enquere,  
> What stately building durst so high extend  
> Her loftie towres vnto the starry sphere,  
> And what vnknowen nation there empeopled were.
>
> Faire knight (quoth he) *Hierusalem* that is,  
> The new *Hierusalem*, that God has built  
> For those to dwell in, that are chosen his,  
> His chosen people purg'd from sinfull guilt,  
> With pretious bloud, which cruelly was spilt  
> On cursed tree, of that vnspotted lam,  
> That for the sinnes of all the world was kilt:  
> Now are they Saints all in that Citie sam,  
> More deare vnto their God, then yoũglings to their dam.
>
> Till now, said then the knight, I weened well,  
> That great *Cleopolis*, where I haue beene,  
> In which that fairest *Faerie Queene* doth dwell,  
> The fairest Citie was, that might be seene;  
> And that bright towre all built of christall cleene,  
> *Panthea*, seemd the brightest thing, that was:  
> But now by proofe all otherwise I weene;  
> For this great Citie that does far surpas,  
> And this bright Angels towre quite dims that towre of glas.
>
> Most trew, then said the holy aged man;  
> Yet is *Cleopolis* for earthly frame,  
> The fairest peece, that eye beholden can:  
> And well beseemes all knights of noble name,  
> That couet in th'immortall booke of fame  
> To be eternized, that same to haunt,  
> And doen their seruice to that soueraigne Dame,  
> That glorie does to them for guerdon graunt:  
> For she is heauenly borne, and heauen may iustly vaunt.
>
> And thou faire ymp, sprong out from English race,  
> How euer now accompted Elfins sonne,  
> Well worthy doest thy seruice for her grace,  
> To aide a virgin desolate foredonne.  
> But when thou famous victorie hast wonne,  
> And high emongst all knights hast hong thy shield,  
> Thenceforth the suit of earthly conquest shonne,  
> And wash thy hands from guilt of bloudy field:  
> For bloud can nought but sin, & wars but sorrowes yield.
>
> Then seeke this path, that I to thee presage,  
> Which after all to heauen shall thee send;  
> Then peaceably thy painefull pilgrimage  
> To yonder same *Hierusalem* do bend,  
> Where is for thee ordaind a blessed end:  
> For thou emongst those Saints, whom thou doest see,  
> Shalt be a Saint, and thine owne nations frend  
> And Patrone: thou Saint *George* shalt called bee,  
> Saint *George* of mery England, the signe of victoree.
>
> Vnworthy wretch (quoth he) of so great grace,  
> How dare I thinke such glory to attaine?  
> These that haue it attaind, were in like cace  
> (Quoth he) as wretched, and liu'd in like paine.  
> But deeds of armes must I at last be faine,  
> And Ladies loue to leaue so dearely bought?  
> What need of armes, where peace doth ay remaine,  
> (Said he) and battailes none are to be fought?  
> As for loose loues they are vaine, and vanish into nought.
>
> O let me not (quoth he) then turne againe  
> Backe to the world, whose ioyes so fruitlesse are;  
> But let me here for aye in peace remaine,  
> Or streight way on that last long voyage fare,  
> That nothing may my present hope empare.  
> That may not be (said he) ne maist thou yit  
> Forgo that royall maides bequeathed care,  
> Who did her cause into thy hand commit,  
> Till from her cursed foe thou haue her freely quit.
>
> Then shall I soone, (quoth he) so God me grace,  
> Abet that virgins cause disconsolate,  
> And shortly backe returne vnto this place,  
> To walke this way in Pilgrims poore estate.  
> But now aread, old father, why of late  
> Didst thou behight me borne of English blood,  
> Whom all a Faeries sonne doen nominate?  
> That word shall I (said he) auouchen good,  
> Sith to thee is vnknowne the cradle of thy brood.
>
> For well I wote, thou springst from ancient race  
> Of *Saxon* kings, that haue with mightie hand  
> And many bloudie battailes fought in place  
> High reard their royall throne in *Britane* land,  
> And vanquisht them, vnable to withstand:  
> From thence a Faerie thee vnweeting reft,  
> There as thou slepst in tender swadling band,  
> And her base Elfin brood there for thee left.  
> Such men do Chaungelings call, so chaungd by Faeries theft.
>
> Thence she thee brought into this Faerie lond,  
> And in an heaped furrow did thee hyde,  
> Where thee a Ploughman all vnweeting fond,  
> As he his toylesome teme that way did guyde,  
> And brought thee vp in ploughmans state to byde,  
> Whereof *Georgos* he thee gaue to name;  
> Till prickt with courage, and thy forces pryde,  
> To Faery court thou cam'st to seeke for fame,  
> And proue thy puissaunt armes, as seemes thee best became.
>
> O holy Sire (quoth he) how shall I quight  
> The many fauours I with thee haue found,  
> That hast my name and nation red aright,  
> And taught the way that does to heauen bound?  
> This said, adowne he looked to the ground,  
> To haue returnd, but dazed were his eyne,  
> Through passing brightnesse, which did quite cõfound  
> His feeble sence, and too exceeding shyne.  
> So darke are earthly things compard to things diuine.
>
> At last whenas himselfe he gan to find,  
> To *Vna* back he cast him to retire;  
> Who him awaited still with pensiue mind.  
> Great thankes and goodly meed to that good syre,  
> He thence departing gaue for his paines hyre.  
> So came to *Vna*, who him ioyd to see,  
> And after litle rest, gan him desire,  
> Of her aduenture mindfull for to bee.  
> So leaue they take of *Coelia*, and her daughters three.
