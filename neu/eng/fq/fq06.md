*Cant. IIII.*

> *To sinfull house of Pride, Duessa  
> guides the faithfull knight,  
> Where brothers death to wreak Sansioy  
> doth chalenge him to fight.*

> YOung knight, what euer that dost armes professe,  
>    And through long labours huntest after fame,  
>    Beware of fraud, beware of ficklenesse,  
>    In choice, and change of thy deare loued Dame,  
>    Least thou of her beleeue too lightly blame,  
>    And rash misweening doe thy hart remoue:  
>    For vnto knight there is no greater shame,  
>    Then lightnesse and inconstancie in loue;  
> That doth this *Redcrosse* knights ensample plainly proue.
>
> Who after that he had faire *Vna* lorne,  
>    Through light misdeeming of her loialtie,  
>    And false *Duessa* in her sted had borne,  
>    Called *Fidess'*, and so supposd to bee;  
>    Long with her traueild, till at last they see  
>    A goodly building, brauely garnished,  
>    The house of mightie Prince it seemd to bee:  
>    And towards it a broad high way that led,  
> All bare through peoples feet, which thither traueiled.
>
> Great troupes of people traueild thitherward  
>    Both day and night, of each degree and place,  
>    But few returned, hauing scaped hard,  
>    With balefull beggerie, or foule disgrace,  
>    Which euer after in most wretched case,  
>    Like loathsome lazars, by the hedges lay.  
>    Thither *Duessa* bad him bend his pace:  
>    For she is wearie of the toilesome way,  
> And also nigh consumed is the lingring day.
>
> A stately Pallace built of squared bricke,  
>    Which cunningly was without morter laid,  
>    Whose wals were high, but nothing strong, nor thick,  
>    And golden foile all ouer them displaid,  
>    That purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid:  
>    High lifted vp were many loftie towres,  
>    And goodly galleries farre ouer laid,  
>    Full of faire windowes, and delightfull bowres;  
> And on the top a Diall told the timely howres.
>
> It was a goodly heape for to behould,  
>    And spake the praises of the workmans wit;  
>    But full great pittie, that so faire a mould  
>    Did on so weake foundation euer sit:  
>    For on a sandie hill, that still did flit,  
>    And fall away, it mounted was full hie,  
>    That euery breath of heauen shaked it:  
>    And all the hinder parts, that few could spie,  
> Were ruinous and old, but painted cunningly.
>
> Arriued there they passed in forth right;  
>    For still to all the gates stood open wide,  
>    Yet charge of them was to a Porter hight  
>    Cald *Maluenú*, who entrance none denide:  
>    Thence to the hall, which was on euery side  
>    With rich array and costly arras dight:  
>    Infinite sorts of people did abide  
>    There waiting long, to win the wished sight  
> Of her, that was the Lady of that Pallace bright.
>
> By them they passe, all gazing on them round,  
>    And to the Presence mount; whose glorious vew  
>    Their frayle amazed senses did confound:  
>    In liuing Princes court none euer knew  
>    Such endlesse richesse, and so sumptuous shew;  
>    Ne *Persia* selfe, the nourse of pompous pride  
>    Like euer saw. And there a noble crew  
>    Of Lordes and Ladies stood on euery side  
> Which with their presence faire, the place much beautifide.
>
> High aboue all a cloth of State was spred,  
>    And a rich throne, as bright as sunny day,  
>    On which there sate most braue embellished  
>    With royall robes and gorgeous array,  
>    A mayden Queene, that shone as *Titans* ray,  
>    In glistring gold, and peerelesse pretious stone:  
>    Yet her bright blazing beautie did assay  
>    To dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne,  
> As enuying her selfe, that too exceeding shone.
>
> Exceeding shone, like *Phoebus* fairest childe,  
>    That did presume his fathers firie wayne,  
>    And flaming mouthes of steedes vnwonted wilde  
>    Through highest heauen with weaker hand to rayne;  
>    Proud of such glory and aduancement vaine,  
>    While flashing beames do daze his feeble eyen,  
>    He leaues the welkin way most beaten plaine,  
>    And rapt with whirling wheeles, inflames the skyen,  
> With fire not made to burne, but fairely for to shyne.
>
> So proud she shyned in her Princely state,  
>    Looking to heauen; for earth she did disdayne,  
>    And sitting high; for lowly she did hate:  
>    Lo vnderneath her scornefull feete, was layne  
>    A dreadfull Dragon with an hideous trayne,  
>    And in her hand she held a mirrhour bright,  
>    Wherein her face she often vewed fayne,  
>    And in her selfe-lou'd semblance tooke delight;  
> For she was wondrous faire, as any liuing wight.
>
> Of griesly *Pluto* she the daughter was,  
>    And sad *Proserpina* the Queene of hell;  
>    Yet did she thinke her pearelesse wroth to pas  
>    That parentage, with pride so did she swell,  
>    And thundring *Ioue*, that high in heauen doth dwell,  
>    And wield the world, she claymed for her syre,  
>    Or if that any else did *Ioue* excell:  
>    For to the highest she did still aspyre,  
> Or if ought higher were then that, did it desyre.
>
> And proud *Lucifera* men did her call,  
>    That made her selfe a Queene, and crownd to be,  
>    Yet rightfull kingdome she had none at all,  
>    Ne heritage of natiue soueraintie,  
>    But did vsurpe with wrong and tyrannie  
>    Vpon the scepter, which she now did hold:  
>    Ne ruld her Realmes with lawes, but pollicie,  
>    And strong aduizement of six wisards old,  
> That with their counsels bad her kingdome did vphold.
>
> Soone as the Elfing knight in presence came,  
>    And false *Duessa* seeming Lady faire,  
>    A gentle Husher, *Vanitie* by name  
>    Made rowme, and passage for them did prepaire:  
>    So goodly brought them to the lowest staire  
>    Of her high throne, where they on humble knee  
>    Making obeyssance, did the cause declare,  
>    Why they were come, her royall state to see,  
> To proue the wide report of her great Maiestee.
>
> With loftie eyes, halfe loth to looke so low,  
>    She thanked them in her disdainefull wise,  
>    Ne other grace vouchsafed them to show  
>    Of Princesse worthy, scarse them bad arise.  
>    Her Lordes and Ladies all this while deuise  
>    Themselues to setten forth to straungers sight:  
>    Some frounce their curled haire in courtly guise,  
>    Some prancke their ruffes, and others trimly dight  
> Their gay attire: each others greater pride does spight.
>
> Goodly they all that knight do entertaine,  
>    Right glad with him to haue increast their crew:  
>    But to *Duess'* each one himselfe did paine  
>    All kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew;  
>    For in that court whylome her well they knew:  
>    Yet the stout Faerie mongst the middest crowd  
>    Thought all their glorie vaine in knightly vew,  
>    And that great Princesse too exceeding prowd,  
> That to strange knight no better countenance allowd.
>
> Suddein vpriseth from her stately place  
>    The royall Dame, and for her coche doth call:  
>    All hurtlen forth, and she with Princely pace,  
>    As faire *Aurora* in her purple pall,  
>    Out of the East the dawning day doth call:  
>    So forth she comes: her brightnesse brode doth blaze;  
>    The heapes of people thronging in the hall,  
>    Do ride each other, vpon her to gaze:  
> Her glorious glitterand light doth all mens eyes amaze.
>
> So forth she comes, and to her coche does clyme,  
>    Adorned all with gold, and girlonds gay,  
>    That seemd as fresh as *Flora* in her prime,  
>    And stroue to match, in royall rich array,  
>    Great *Iunoes* golden chaire, the which they say  
>    The Gods stand gazing on, when she does ride  
>    To *Ioues* high house through heauens bras-paued way Drawne of
> faire Pecocks, that excell in pride,  
> And full of *Argus* eyes their tailes dispredden wide.
>
> But this was drawne of six vnequall beasts,  
>    On which her six sage Counsellours did ryde,  
>    Taught to obay their bestiall beheasts,  
>    With like conditions to their kinds applyde:  
>    Of which the first, that all the rest did guyde,  
>    Was sluggish *Idlenesse* the nourse of sin;  
>    Vpon a slouthfull Asse he chose to ryde,  
>    Arayd in habit blacke, and amis thin,  
> Like to an holy Monck, the seruice to begin.
>
> And in his hand his Portesse still he bare,  
>    That much was worne, but therein little red,  
>    For of deuotion he had little care,  
>    Still drownd in sleepe, and most of his dayes ded;  
>    Scarse could he once vphold his heauie hed,  
>    To looken, whether it were night or day:  
>    May seeme the wayne was very euill led,  
>    When such an one had guiding of the way,  
> That knew not, whether right he went, or else astray.
>
> From worldy cares himselfe he did esloyne,  
>    And greatly shunned manly exercise,  
>    From euery worke he chalenged essoyne,  
>    For contemplation sake: yet otherwise,  
>    His life he led in lawlesse riotise;  
>    By which he grew to grieuous malady;  
>    For in his lustlesse limbs through euill guise  
>    A shaking feuer raignd continually:  
> Such one was *Idlenesse*, first of this company.
>
> And by his side rode loathsome *Gluttony*,  
>    Deformed creature, on a filthie swyne,  
>    His belly was vp-blowne with luxury,  
>    And eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne,  
>    And like a Crane his necke was long and fyne,  
>    With which he swallowd vp excessiue feast,  
>    For want whereof poore people oft did pyne;  
>    And all the way, most like a brutish beast,  
>    He spued vp his gorge, that all did him deteast.
>
> In greene vine leaues he was right fitly clad;  
>    For other clothes he could not weare for heat,  
>    And on his head an yuie girland had,  
>    From vnder which fast trickled downe the sweat:  
>    Still as he rode, he somewhat still did eat,  
>    And in his hand did beare a bouzing can,  
>    Of which he supt so oft, that on his seat  
>    His dronken corse he scarse vpholden can,  
> In shape and life more like a monster, then a man.
>
> Vnfit he was for any worldy thing,  
>    And eke vnhable once to stirre or go,  
>    Not meet to be of counsell to a king,  
>    Whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so,  
>    That from his friend he seldome knew his fo:  
>    Full of diseases was his carcas blew,  
>    And a dry dropsie through his flesh did flow:  
>    Which by misdiet daily greater grew:  
> Such one was *Gluttony*, the second of that crew.
>
> And next to him rode lustfull *Lechery*,  
>    Vpon a bearded Goat, whose rugged haire,  
>    And whally eyes (the signe of gelosy,)  
>    Was like the person selfe, whom he did beare:  
>    Who rough, and blacke, and filthy did appeare,  
>    Vnseemely man to please faire Ladies eye;  
>    Yet he of Ladies oft was loued deare,  
>    When fairer faces were bid standen by:  
> O who does know the bent of womens fantasy?
>
> In a greene gowne he clothed was full faire,  
>    Which vnderneath did hide his filthinesse,  
>    And in his hand a burning hart he bare,  
>    Full of vaine follies, and new fanglenesse:  
>    For he was false, and fraught with ficklenesse,  
>    And learned had to loue with secret lookes,  
>    And well could daunce, and sing with ruefulnesse,  
>    And fortunes tell, and read in louing bookes,  
> And thousand other wayes, to bait his fleshly hookes.
>
> Inconstant man, that loued all he saw,  
>    And lusted after all, that he did loue,  
>    Ne would his looser life be tide to law,  
>    But ioyd weake wemens hearts to tempt, and proue  
>    If from their loyall loues he might then moue;  
>    Which lewdnesse fild him with reprochfull paine  
>    Of that fowle euill, which all men reproue,  
>    That rots the marrow, and consumes the braine:  
> Such one was *Lecherie*, the third of all this traine.
>
> And greedy *Auarice* by him did ride,  
>    Vpon a Camell loaden all with gold;  
>    Two iron coffers hong on either side,  
>    With precious mettall full, as they might hold,  
>    And in his lap an heape of coine he told;  
>    For of his wicked pelfe his God he made,  
>    And vnto hell him selfe for money sold;  
>    Accursed vsurie was all his trade,  
> And right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide.
>
> His life was nigh vnto deaths doore yplast,  
>    And thred-bare cote, and cobled shoes he ware,  
>    Ne scarse good morsell all his life did tast,  
>    But both from backe and belly still did spare,  
>    To fill his bags, and richesse to compare;  
>    Yet chylde ne kinsman liuing had he none  
>    To leaue them to; but thorough daily care  
>    To get, and nightly feare to lose his owne,  
> He led a wretched life vnto him selfe vnknowne.
>
> Most wretched wight, whom nothing might suffise,  
>    Whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store,  
>    Whose need had end, but no end couetise,  
>    Whose wealth was want, whose plẽty made him pore,  
>    Who had enough, yet wished euer more;  
>    A vile disease, and eke in foote and hand  
>    A grieuous gout tormented him full sore,  
>    That well he could not touch, nor go, nor stand:  
> Such one was *Auarice*, the fourth of this faire band.
>
> And next to him malicious *Enuie* rode,  
>    Vpon a rauenous wolfe, and still did chaw  
>    Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous tode,  
>    That all the poison ran about his chaw;  
>    But inwardly he chawed his owne maw  
>    At neighbours wealth, that made him euer sad;  
>    For death it was, when any good he saw,  
>    And wept, that cause of weeping none he had,  
> But when he heard of harme, he wexed wondrous glad.
>
> All in a kirtle of discolourd say  
>    He clothed was, ypainted full of eyes;  
>    And in his bosome secretly there lay  
>    An hatefull Snake, the which his taile vptyes  
>    In many folds, and mortall sting implyes.  
>    Still as he rode, he gnasht his teeth, to see  
>    Those heapes of gold with griple Couetyse,  
>    And grudged at the great felicitie  
> Of proud *Lucifera*, and his owne companie.
>
> He hated all good workes and vertuous deeds,  
>    And him no lesse, that any like did vse,  
>    And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,  
>    His almes for want of faith he doth accuse;  
>    So euery good to bad he doth abuse:  
>    And eke the verse of famous Poets witt  
>    He does backebite, and spightfull poison spues  
>    From leprous mouth on all, that euer writt:  
> Such one vile *Enuie* was, that fift in row did sitt.
>
> And him beside rides fierce reuenging *VVrath*,  
>    Vpon a Lion, loth for to be led;  
>    And in his hand a burning brond he hath,  
>    The which he brandisheth about his hed;  
>    His eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red,  
>    And stared sterne on all, that him beheld,  
>    As ashes pale of hew and seeming ded;  
>    And on his dagger still his hand he held,  
> Trembling through hasty rage, whẽ choler in him sweld.
>
> His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood,  
>    Which he had spilt, and all to rags yrent,  
>    Through vnaduized rashnesse woxen wood;  
>    For of his hands he had no gouernement,  
>    Ne car'd for bloud in his auengement:  
>    But when the furious fit was ouerpast,  
>    His cruell facts he often would repent;  
>    Yet wilfull man he neuer would forecast,  
> How many mischieues should ensue his heedlesse hast.
>
> Full many mischiefes follow cruell *VVrath*;  
>    Abhorred bloudshed, and tumultuous strife,  
>    Vnmanly murder, and vnthrifty scath,  
>    Bitter despight, with rancours rusty knife,  
>    And fretting griefe the enemy of life;  
>    All these, and many euils moe haunt ire,  
>    The swelling Splene, and Frenzy raging rife,  
>    The shaking Palsey, and Saint *Fraunces* fire:  
> Such one was *VVrath*, the last of this vngodly tire.
>
> And after all, vpon the wagon beame  
>    Rode *Sathan*, with a smarting whip in hand,  
>    With which he forward lasht the laesie teme,  
>    So oft as *Slowth* still in the mire did stand.  
>    Huge routs of people did about them band,  
>    Showting for ioy, and still before their way  
>    A foggy mist had couered all the land;  
>    And vnderneath their feet, all scattered lay  
> Dead sculs & bones of men, whose life had gone astray.
>
> So forth they marchen in this goodly sort,  
>    To take the solace of the open aire,  
>    And in fresh flowring fields themselues to sport;  
>    Emongst the rest rode that false Lady faire,  
>    The fowle *Duessa*, next vnto the chaire  
>    Of proud *Lucifer'*, as one of the traine:  
>    But that good knight would not so nigh repaire,  
>    Him selfe estraunging from their ioyaunce vaine,  
> Whose fellowship seemd far vnfit for warlike swaine.
>
> So hauing solaced themselues a space  
>    With pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed  
>    They backe returned to the Princely Place;  
>    Whereas an errant knight in armes ycled,  
>    And heathnish shield, wherein with letters red  
>    Was writ *Sans ioy*, they new arriued find:  
>    Enflam'd with fury and fiers hardy-hed,  
>    He seemd in hart to harbour thoughts vnkind,  
> And nourish bloudy vengeaunce in his bitter mind.
>
> Who when the shamed shield of slaine *Sans foy*  
>    He spide with that same Faery champions page,  
>    Bewraying him, that did of late destroy  
>    His eldest brother, burning all with rage  
>    He to him leapt, and that same enuious gage  
>    Of victors glory from him snatcht away:  
>    But th'Elfin knight, which ought that warlike wage,  
>    Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray,  
> And him rencountring fierce, reskewd the noble pray.
>
> Therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily,  
>    Redoubted battaile ready to darrayne,  
>    And clash their shields, and shake their swords on hy,  
>    That with their sturre they troubled all the traine;  
>    Till that great Queene vpon eternall paine  
>    Of high displeasure, that ensewen might,  
>    Commaunded them their fury to refraine,  
>    And if that either to that shield had right,  
> In equall lists they should the morrow next it fight.
>
> Ah dearest Dame, (quoth then the Paynim bold,)  
>    Pardon the errour of enraged wight,  
>    Whom great griefe made forget the raines to hold  
>    Of reasons rule, to see this recreant knight,  
>    No knight, but treachour full of false despight  
>    And shamefull treason, who through guile hath slayn  
>    The prowest knight, that euer field did fight,  
>    Euen stout *Sans foy* (O who can then refrayn?)  
> Whose shield he beares renuerst, the more to heape disdayn.
>
> And to augment the glorie of his guile,  
>    His dearest loue the faire *Fidessa* loe  
>    Is there possessed of the traytour vile,  
>    Who reapes the haruest sowen by his foe,  
>    Sowen in bloudy field, and bought with woe:  
>    That brothers hand shall dearely well requight  
>    So be, ô Queene, you equall fauour showe.  
>    Him litle answerd th'angry Elfin knight;  
> He neuer meant with words, but swords to plead his right.
>
> But threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge,  
>    His cause in combat the next day to try:  
>    So been they parted both, with harts on edge,  
>    To be aueng'd each on his enimy.  
>    That night they pas in ioy and iollity,  
>    Feasting and courting both in bowre and hall;  
>    For Steward was excessiue *Gluttonie*,  
>    That of his plenty poured forth to all:  
> Which doen, the Chamberlain *Slowth* did to rest them call.

> Now whenas darkesome night had all displayd

>    But whenas *Morpheus* had with leaden mace  
>    Arrested all that courtly company,  
>    Vp-rose *Duessa* from her resting place,  
> And to the Paynims lodging comes with silent pace.
>
> Whom broad awake she finds, in troublous fit,

>    Cause of my new griefe, cause of my new ioy,  
>    Ioyous, to see his ymage in mine eye,  
>    And greeu'd, to thinke how foe did him destroy,  
>    That was the flowre of grace and cheualrye;  
> Lo his *Fidessa* to thy secret faith I flye.
>
> With gentle wordes he can her fairely greet,  
>    And bad say on the secret of her hart.  
>    Then sighing soft, I learne that litle sweet  
>    Oft tempred is (quoth she) with muchell smart:  
>    For since my brest was launcht with louely dart  
>    Of deare *Sansfoy*, I neuer ioyed howre,  
>    But in eternall woes my weaker hart  
>    Haue wasted, louing him with all my powre,  
> And for his sake haue felt full many an heauie stowre.
>
> At last when perils all I weened past,  
>    And hop'd to reape the crop of all my care,  
>    Into new woes vnweeting I was cast,  
>    By this false faytor, who vnworthy ware  
>    His worthy shield, whom he with guilefull snare  
>    Entrapped slew, and brought to shamefull graue.  
>    Me silly maid away with him he bare,  
>    And euer since hath kept in darksome caue,  
> For that I would not yeeld, that to *Sans-foy* I gaue.
>
> But since faire Sunne hath sperst that lowring clowd,  
>    And to my loathed life now shewes some light,  
>    Vnder your beames I will me safely shrowd,  
>    From dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight:  
>    To you th'inheritance belongs by right

>    Let not his loue, let not his restlesse spright  
>    Be vnreueng'd, that calles to you aboue  
> From wandring *Stygian* shores, where it doth endlesse moue.
>
> Thereto said he, Faire Dame be nought dismaid  
>    For sorrowes past; their griefe is with them gone:  
>    Ne yet of present perill be affraid;  
>    For needlesse feare did neuer vantage none,

> O but I feare the fickle freakes (quoth shee)  
>    Of fortune false, and oddes of armes in field.  
>    Why dame (quoth he) what oddes can euer bee,  
>    Where both do fight alike, to win or yield?  
>    Yea but (quoth she) he beares a charmed shield,  
>    And eke enchaunted armes, that none can perce,  
>    Ne none can wound the man, that does them wield.  
>    Charmd or enchaunted (answerd he then ferce)  
> I no whit reck, ne you the like need to reherce.
>
> But faire *Fidessa*, sithens fortunes guile,  
>    Or enimies powre hath now captiued you,  
>    Returne from whence ye came, and rest a while  
>    Till morrow next, that I the Elfe subdew,  
>    And with *Sans-foyes* dead dowry you endew.  
>    Ay me, that is a double death (she said)  
>    With proud foes sight my sorrow to renew:  
>    Where euer yet I be, my secrete aid  
> Shall follow you. So passing forth she him obaid.
