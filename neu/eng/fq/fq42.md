*Cant. III.*

> *The battell twixt three brethren, with  
> Cambell for Canacee.  
> Cambina with true friendships bond  
> doth their long strife agree.*

> O Why doe wretched men so much desire,  
> To draw their dayes vnto the vtmost date,  
> And doe not rather wish them soone expire,  
> Knowing the miserie of their estate,  
> And thousand perills which them still awate,  
> Tossing them like a boate amid the mayne,  
> That euery houre they knocke at deathes gate?  
> And he that happie seemes and least in payne,  
> Yet is as nigh his end, as he that most doth playne.
>
> Therefore this Fay I hold but fond and vaine,  
> The which in seeking for her children three  
> Long life, thereby did more prolong their paine.  
> Yet whilest they liued none did euer see  
> More happie creatures, then they seem'd to bee,  
> Nor more ennobled for their courtesie,  
> That made them dearely lou'd of each degree;  
> Ne more renowmed for their cheualrie,  
> That made them dreaded much of all men farre and nie.
>
> These three that hardie chalenge tooke in hand,  
> For *Canacee* with *Cambell* for to fight:  
> The day was set, that all might vnderstand,  
> And pledges pawnd the same to keepe a right,  
> That day, the dreddest day that liuing wight  
> Did euer see vpon this world to shine,  
> So soone as heauens window shewed light,  
> These warlike Champions all in armour shine,  
> Assembled were in field, the chalenge to define.
>
> The field with listes was all about enclos'd,  
> To barre the prease of people farre away;  
> And at th'one side sixe iudges were dispos'd,  
> To view and deeme the deedes of armes that day;  
> And on the other side in fresh aray,  
> Fayre *Canacee* vpon a stately stage  
> Was set, to see the fortune of that fray,  
> And to be seene, as his most worthie wage,  
> That could her purchase with his liues aduentur'd gage.
>
> Then entred *Cambell* first into the list,  
> With stately steps, and fearelesse countenance,  
> As if the conquest his he surely wist.  
> Soone after did the brethren three aduance,  
> In braue aray and goodly amenance,  
> With scutchins gilt and banners broad displayd:  
> And marching thrise in warlike ordinance,  
> Thrise lowted lowly to the noble Mayd,  
> The whiles shril trompets & loud clarions sweetly playd.
>
> Which doen the doughty chalenger came forth,  
> All arm'd to point his chalenge to abet:  
> Gainst whom Sir *Priamond* with equall worth:  
> And equall armes himselfe did forward set.  
> A trompet blew; they both together met,  
> With dreadfull force, and furious intent,  
> Carelesse of perill in their fiers affret,  
> As if that life to losse they had forelent,  
> And cared not to spare, that should be shortly spent.
>
> Right practicke was Sir *Priamond* in fight,  
> And throughly skild in vse of shield and speare;  
> Ne lesse approued was *Cambelloes* might,  
> Ne lesse his skill in weapons did appeare,  
> That hard it was to weene which harder were.  
> Full many mightie strokes on either side  
> Were sent, that seemed death in them to beare,  
> But they were both so watchfull and well eyde,  
> That they auoyded were, and vainely by did slyde.
>
> Yet one of many was so strongly bent  
> By *Priamond*, that with vnluckie glaunce,  
> Through *Cambels* shoulder it vnwarely went,  
> That forced him his shield to disaduaunce:  
> Much was he grieued with that gracelesse chaunce,  
> Yet from the wound no drop of bloud there fell,  
> But wondrous paine, that did the more enhaunce  
> His haughtie courage to aduengement fell:  
> Smart daunts not mighty harts, but makes them more to swell.
>
> With that his poynant speare he fierce auentred,  
> With doubled force close vnderneath his shield,  
> That through the mayles into his thigh it entred,  
> And there arresting, readie way did yield,  
> For bloud to gush forth on the grassie field;  
> That he for paine himselfe n'ote right vpreare,  
> But too and fro in great amazement reel'd,  
> Like an old Oke whose pith and sap is seare,  
> At puffe of euery storme doth stagger here and theare.
>
> Whom so dismayd when *Cambell* had espide,  
> Againe he droue at him with double might,  
> That nought mote stay the steele, till in his side  
> The mortall point most cruelly empight:  
> Where fast infixed, whilest he sought by slight  
> It forth to wrest, the staffe a sunder brake,  
> And left the head behind: with which despight  
> He all enrag'd, his shiuering speare did shake,  
> And charging him a fresh thus felly him bespake.
>
> Lo faitour there thy meede vnto thee take,  
> The meede of thy mischalenge and abet:  
> Not for thine owne, but for thy sisters sake,  
> Haue I thus long thy life vnto thee let:  
> But to forbeare doth not forgiue the det.  
> The wicked weapon heard his wrathfull vow,  
> And passing forth with furious affret,  
> Pierst through his beuer quite into his brow,  
> That with the force it backward forced him to bow.
>
> Therewith a sunder in the midst it brast,  
> And in his hand nought but the troncheon left,  
> The other halfe behind yet sticking fast,  
> Out of his headpeece *Cambell* fiercely reft,  
> And with such furie backe at him it heft,  
> That making way vnto his dearest life,  
> His weasand pipe it through his gorget cleft:  
> Thence streames of purple bloud issuing rife,  
> Let forth his wearie ghost and made an end of strife.
>
> His wearie ghost assoyld from fleshly band,  
> Did not as others wont, directly fly  
> Vnto her rest in Plutoes griesly land,  
> Ne into ayre did vanish presently,  
> Ne chaunged was into a starre in sky:  
> But through traduction was eftsoones deriued,  
> Like as his mother prayd the Destinie,  
> Into his other brethren, that suruiued,  
> In whom he liu'd a new, of former life depriued.
>
> Whom when on ground his brother next beheld,  
> Though sad and sorie for so heauy sight,  
> Yet leaue vnto his sorrow did not yeeld,  
> But rather stird to vengeance and despight,  
> Through secret feeling of his generous spright,  
> Rusht fiercely forth, the battell to renew,  
> As in reuersion of his brothers right;  
> And chalenging the Virgin as his dew.  
> His foe was soone addrest: the trompets freshly blew.
>
> With that they both together fiercely met,  
> As if that each ment other to deuoure;  
> And with their axes both so sorely bet,  
> That neither plate nor mayle, whereas their powre  
> They felt, could once sustaine the hideous stowre,  
> But riued were like rotten wood a sunder,  
> Whilest through their rifts the ruddie bloud did showre  
> And fire did flash, like lightning after thunder,  
> That fild the lookers on attonce with ruth and wonder.
>
> As when two Tygers prickt with hungers rage,  
> Haue by good fortune found some beasts fresh spoyle,  
> On which they weene their famine to asswage,  
> And gaine a feastfull guerdon of their toyle,  
> Both falling out doe stirre vp strifefull broyle,  
> And cruell battell twixt themselues doe make,  
> Whiles neither lets the other touch the soyle,  
> But either sdeignes with other to partake:  
> So cruelly these Knights stroue for that Ladies sake.
>
> Full many strokes, that mortally were ment,  
> The whiles were enterchaunged twixt them two;  
> Yet they were all with so good wariment  
> Or warded, or auoyded and let goe,  
> That still the life stood fearelesse of her foe:  
> Till *Diamond* disdeigning long delay  
> Of doubtfull fortune wauering to and fro,  
> Resolu'd to end it one or other way;  
> And heau'd his murdrous axe at him with mighty sway.
>
> The dreadfull stroke in case it had arriued,  
> Where it was ment, (so deadly it was ment)  
> The soule had sure out of his bodie riued,  
> And stinted all the strife incontinent.  
> But *Cambels* fate that fortune did preuent:  
> For seeing it at hand, he swaru'd asyde,  
> And so gaue way vnto his fell intent:  
> Who missing of the marke which he had eyde,  
> Was with the force nigh feld whilst his right foot did slyde.
>
> As when a Vulture greedie of his pray,  
> Through hunger long, that hart to him doth lend,  
> Strikes at an Heron with all his bodies sway,  
> That from his force seemes nought may it defend;  
> The warie fowle that spies him toward bend  
> His dreadfull souse auoydes, it shunning light,  
> And maketh him his wing in vaine to spend;  
> That with the weight of his owne weeldlesse might,  
> He falleth nigh to ground, and scarse recouereth flight.
>
> Which faire aduenture when *Cambello* spide,  
> Full lightly, ere himselfe he could recower,  
> From daungers dread to ward his naked side,  
> He can let driue at him with all his power,  
> And with his axe him smote in euill hower,  
> That from his shoulders quite his head he reft:  
> The headlesse tronke, as heedlesse of that stower,  
> Stood still a while, and his fast footing kept,  
> Till feeling life to fayle, it fell, and deadly slept.
>
> They which that piteous spectacle beheld,  
> Were much amaz'd the headlesse tronke to see  
> Stand vp so long, and weapon vaine to weld,  
> Vnweeting of the Fates diuine decree,  
> For lifes succession in those brethren three.  
> For notwithstanding that one soule was reft,  
> Yet, had the bodie not dismembred bee,  
> It would haue liued, and reuiued eft;  
> But finding no fit seat, the lifelesse corse it left.
>
> It left; but that same soule, which therein dwelt,  
> Streight entring into *Triamond*, him fild  
> With double life, and griefe, which when he felt,  
> As one whose inner parts had bene ythrild  
> With point of steele, that close his hartbloud spild,  
> He lightly lept out of his place of rest,  
> And rushing forth into the emptie field,  
> Against *Cambello* fiercely him addrest;  
> Who him affronting soone to fight was readie prest.
>
> Well mote ye wonder how that noble Knight,  
> After he had so often wounded beene,  
> Could stand on foot, now to renew the fight.  
> But had ye then him forth aduauncing seene,  
> Some newborne wight ye would him surely weene:  
> So fresh he seemed and so fierce in sight;  
> Like as a Snake, whom wearie winters teene,  
> Hath worne to nought, now feeling sommers might,  
> Casts off his ragged skin and freshly doth him dight.
>
> All was through vertue of the ring he wore,  
> The which not onely did not from him let  
> One drop of bloud to fall, but did restore  
> His weakned powers, and dulled spirits whet,  
> Through working of the stone therein yset.  
> Else how could one of equall might with most,  
> Against so many no lesse mightie met,  
> Once thinke to match three such on equall cost,  
> Three such as able were to match a puissant host.
>
> Yet nought thereof was *Triamond* adredde,  
> Ne desperate of glorious victorie,  
> But sharpely him assayld, and sore bestedde,  
> With heapes of strokes, which he at him let flie,  
> As thicke as hayle forth poured from the skie:  
> He stroke, he soust, he foynd, he hewd, he lasht,  
> And did his yron brond so fast applie,  
> That from the same the fierie sparkles flasht,  
> As fast as water-sprinckles gainst a rocke are dasht.
>
> Much was *Cambello* daunted with his blowes,  
> So thicke they fell, and forcibly were sent,  
> That he was forst from daunger of the throwes  
> Backe to retire, and somewhat to relent,  
> Till th'heat of his fierce furie he had spent:  
> Which when for want of breath gan to abate,  
> He then afresh with new encouragement  
> Did him assayle, and mightily amate,  
> As fast as forward erst, now backward to retrate.
>
> Like as the tide that comes fro th'Ocean mayne,  
> Flowes vp the Shenan with contrarie forse,  
> And ouerruling him in his owne rayne,  
> Driues backe the current of his kindly course,  
> And makes it seeme to haue some other sourse:  
> But when the floud is spent, then backe againe  
> His borrowed waters forst to redisbourse,  
> He sends the sea his owne with double gaine,  
> And tribute eke withall, as to his Soueraine.
>
> Thus did the battell varie to and fro,  
> With diuerse fortune doubtfull to be deemed:  
> Now this the better had, now had his fo;  
> Then he halfe vanquisht, then the other seemed,  
> Yet victors both them selues alwayes esteemed.  
> And all the while the disentrayled blood  
> Adowne their sides like litle riuers stremed,  
> That with the wasting of his vitall flood,  
> Sir *Triamond* at last full faint and feeble stood.
>
> But *Cambell* still more strong and greater grew,  
> Ne felt his blood to wast, ne powres emperisht,  
> Through that rings vertue, that with vigour new,  
> Still when as he enfeebled was, him cherisht,  
> And all his wounds, and all his bruses guarisht,  
> Like as a withered tree through husbands toyle  
> Is often seene full freshly to haue florisht,  
> And fruitfull apples to haue borne awhile,  
> As fresh as when it first was planted in the soyle.
>
> Through which aduantage, in his strength he rose,  
> And smote the other with so wondrous might,  
> That through the seame, which did his hauberk close,  
> Into his throate and life it pierced quight,  
> That downe he fell as dead in all mens sight:  
> Yet dead he was not, yet he sure did die,  
> As all men do, that lose the liuing spright:  
> So did one soule out of his bodie flie  
> Vnto her natiue home from mortall miserie.
>
> But nathelesse whilst all the lookers on  
> Him dead behight, as he to all appeard,  
> All vnawares he started vp anon,  
> As one that had out of a dreame bene reard,  
> And fresh assayld his foe; who halfe affeard  
> Of th'vncouth sight, as he some ghost had seene,  
> Stood still amaz'd, holding his idle sweard;  
> Till hauing often by him stricken beene,  
> He forced was to strike, and saue him selfe from teene.
>
> Yet from thenceforth more warily he fought,  
> As one in feare the Stygian gods t'offend,  
> Ne followd on so fast, but rather sought  
> Him selfe to saue, and daunger to defend,  
> Then life and labour both in vaine to spend.  
> Which *Triamond* perceiuing, weened sure  
> He gan to faint, toward the battels end,  
> And that he should not long on foote endure,  
> A signe which did to him the victorie assure.
>
> Whereof full blith, eftsoones his mightie hand  
> He heav'd on high, in mind with that same blow  
> To make an end of all that did withstand:  
> Which *Cambell* seeing come, was nothing slow  
> Him selfe to saue from that so deadly throw;  
> And at that instant reaching forth his sweard  
> Close vnderneath his shield, that scarce did show,  
> Stroke him, as he his hand to strike vpreard,  
> In th'arm-pit full, that through both sides the wound appeard.
>
> Yet still that direfull stroke kept on his way,  
> And falling heauie on *Cambelloes* crest,  
> Strooke him so hugely, that in swowne he lay,  
> And in his head an hideous wound imprest:  
> And sure had it not happily found rest  
> Vpon the brim of his brode plated shield,  
> It would haue cleft his braine downe to his brest.  
> So both at once fell dead vpon the field,  
> And each to other seemd the victorie to yield.
>
> Which when as all the lookers on beheld,  
> They weened sure the warre was at an end,  
> And Iudges rose, and Marshals of the field  
> Broke vp the listes, their armes away to rend;  
> And *Canacee* gan wayle her dearest frend.  
> All suddenly they both vpstarted light,  
> The one out of the swownd, which him did blend,  
> The other breathing now another spright,  
> And fiercely each assayling, gan afresh to fight.
>
> Long while they then continued in that wize,  
> As if but then the battell had begonne:  
> Strokes, wounds, wards, weapons, all they did despise,  
> Ne either car'd to ward, or perill shonne,  
> Desirous both to haue the battell donne;  
> Ne either cared life to saue or spill,  
> Ne which of them did winne, ne which were wonne.  
> So wearie both of fighting had their fill,  
> That life it selfe seemd loathsome, and long safetie ill.
>
> Whilst thus the case in doubtfull ballance hong,  
> Vnsure to whether side it would incline,  
> And all mens eyes and hearts, which there among  
> Stood gazing, filled were with rufull tine,  
> And secret feare, to see their fatall fine,  
> All suddenly they heard a troublous noyes,  
> That seemd some perilous tumult to desine,  
> Confusd with womens cries, and shouts of boyes,  
> Such as the troubled Theaters oftimes annoyes.
>
> Thereat the Champions both stood still a space,  
> To weeten what that sudden clamour ment;  
> Lo where they spyde with speedie whirling pace,  
> One in a charet of straunge furniment,  
> Towards them driuing like a storme out sent.  
> The charet decked was in wondrous wize,  
> With gold and many a gorgeous ornament,  
> After the Persian Monarks antique guize,  
> Such as the maker selfe could best by art deuize.
>
> And drawne it was (that wonder is to tell)  
> Of two grim lyons, taken from the wood,  
> In which their powre all others did excell;  
> Now made forget their former cruell mood,  
> T'obey their riders hest, as seemed good.  
> And therein sate a Ladie passing faire  
> And bright, that seemed borne of Angels brood,  
> And with her beautie bountie did compare,  
> Whether of them in her should haue the greater share.
>
> Thereto she learned was in Magicke leare,  
> And all the artes, that subtill wits discouer,  
> Hauing therein bene trained many a yeare,  
> And well instructed by the Fay her mother,  
> That in the same she farre exceld all other.  
> Who vnderstanding by her mightie art,  
> Of th'euill plight, in which her dearest brother  
> Now stood, came forth in hast to take his part,  
> And pacifie the strife, which causd so deadly smart.
>
> And as she passed through th'vnruly preace  
> Of people, thronging thicke her to behold,  
> Her angrie teame breaking their bonds of peace,  
> Great heapes of them, like sheepe in narrow fold,  
> For hast did ouer-runne, in dust enrould,  
> That thorough rude confusion of the rout,  
> Some fearing shriekt, some being harmed hould,  
> Some laught for sport, some did for wonder shout,  
> And some that would seeme wise, their wonder turnd to dout.
>
> In her right hand a rod of peace shee bore,  
> About the which two Serpents weren wound,  
> Entrayled mutually in louely lore,  
> And by the tailes together firmely bound,  
> And both were with one oliue garland crownd,  
> Like to the rod which *Maias* sonne doth wield,  
> Wherewith the hellish fiends he doth confound.  
> And in her other hand a cup she hild,  
> The which was with Nepenthe to the brim vpfild.
>
> Nepenthe is a drinck of souerayne grace,  
> Deuized by the Gods, for to asswage  
> Harts grief, and bitter gall away to chace,  
> Which stirs vp anguish and contentious rage:  
> In stead thereof sweet peace and quiet age  
> It doth establish in the troubled mynd.  
> Few men, but such as sober are and sage,  
> Are by the Gods to drinck thereof assynd;  
> But such as drinck, eternall happinesse do fynd.
>
> Such famous men, such worthies of the earth,  
> As *Ioue* will haue aduaunced to the skie,  
> And there made gods, though borne of mortall berth,  
> For their high merits and great dignitie,  
> Are wont, before they may to heauen flie,  
> To drincke hereof, whereby all cares forepast  
> Are washt away quite from their memorie.  
> So did those olde Heroes hereof taste,  
> Before that they in blisse amongst the Gods were plaste.
>
> Much more of price and of more gratious powre  
> Is this, then that same water of Ardenne,  
> The which *Rinaldo* drunck in happie howre,  
> Described by that famous Tuscane penne:  
> For that had might to change the hearts of men  
> Fro loue to hate, a change of euill choise:  
> But this doth hatred make in loue to brenne,  
> And heauy heart with comfort doth reioyce.  
> Who would not to this vertue rather yeeld his voice?
>
> At last arriuing by the listes side,  
> Shee with her rod did softly smite the raile,  
> Which straight flew ope, and gaue her way to ride.  
> Eftsoones out of her Coch she gan auaile,  
> And pacing fairely forth, did bid all haile,  
> First to her brother, whom she loued deare,  
> That so to see him made her heart to quaile:  
> And next to *Cambell*, whose sad ruefull cheare  
> Made her to change her hew, and hidden loue t'appeare.
>
> They lightly her requit (for small delight  
> They had as then her long to entertaine.)  
> And eft them turned both againe to fight;  
> Which when she saw, downe on the bloudy plaine  
> Her selfe she threw, and teares gan shed amaine;  
> Amongst her teares immixing prayers meeke,  
> And with her prayers reasons to restraine  
> From blouddy strife, and blessed peace to seeke,  
> By all that vnto them was deare, did them beseeke.
>
> But when as all might nought with them preuaile,  
> Shee smote them lightly with her powrefull wand.  
> Then suddenly as if their hearts did faile,  
> Their wrathfull blades downe fell out of their hand,  
> And they like men astonisht still did stand.  
> Thus whilest their minds were doubtfully distraught,  
> And mighty spirites bound with mightier band,  
> Her golden cup to them for drinke she raught,  
> Whereof full glad for thirst, ech drunk an harty draught.
>
> Of which so soone as they once tasted had,  
> Wonder it is that sudden change to see:  
> Instead of strokes, each other kissed glad,  
> And louely haulst from feare of treason free,  
> And plighted hands for euer friends to be.  
> When all men saw this sudden change of things,  
> So mortall foes so friendly to agree,  
> For passing ioy, which so great maruaile brings,  
> They all gan shout aloud, that all the heauen rings.
>
> All which, when gentle *Canacee* beheld,  
> In hast she from her lofty chaire descended,  
> To weet what sudden tidings was befeld:  
> Where when she saw that cruell war so ended,  
> And deadly foes so faithfully affrended,  
> In louely wise she gan that Lady greet,  
> Which had so great dismay so well amended,  
> And entertaining her with curt'sies meet,  
> Profest to her true friendship and affection sweet.
>
> Thus when they all accorded goodly were,  
> The trumpets sounded, and they all arose,  
> Thence to depart with glee and gladsome chere.  
> Those warlike champions both together chose,  
> Homeward to march, themselues there to repose,  
> And wise *Cambina* taking by her side  
> Faire *Canacee*, as fresh as morning rose,  
> Vnto her Coch remounting, home did ride,  
> Admir'd of all the people, and much glorifide.
>
> Where making ioyous feast theire daies they spent  
> In perfect loue, deuoide of hatefull strife,  
> Allide with bands of mutuall couplement;  
> For *Triamond* had *Canacee* to wife,  
> With whom he ledd a long and happie life;  
> And *Cambel* tooke *Cambina* to his fere,  
> The which as life were each to other liefe.  
> So all alike did loue, and loued were,  
> That since their days such louers were not found elswhere.
