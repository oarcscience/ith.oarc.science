## Commendatory Poems and Sonnets to Persons of Rank

A Vision vpon this conceipt of the *Faery Queene.*

> ME thought I saw the graue where *Laura* lay  
> Within that Temple, where the vestall flame  
> Was wont to burne, and passing by that way,  
> To see that buried dust of liuing fame,  
> Whose tombe faire loue, and fairer vertue kept,  
> All suddenly I saw the Faery Queene:  
> At whose approch the soule of *Petrarke* wept,  
> And from thenceforth those graces were not seene.  
> For they this Queene attended, in whose steed  
> Obliuion laid him downe on *Lauras* herse:  
> Hereat the hardest stones were seene to bleed,  
> And grones of buried ghostes the heuens did perse.  
> Where *Homers* spright did tremble all for griefe,  
> And curst th'accesse of that celestiall theife.  
>    
>  

Another of the same.

> *Vertue her selfe can best discerne, to whom they writen bin.*  
> *If thou hast beauty praysd, let her sole looks diuine*  
> *Iudge if ought therein be amis, and mend it by her meine.*  
> *If Chastitie want ought, or Temperaunce her dew,*  
> *Behold her Princely mind aright, and write thy Queene anew.*  
> *Meane while she shall perceiue, how far her vertues sore*  
> *Aboue the reach of all that liue, or such as wrote of yore:*  
> *And thereby will excuse and fauour thy good will:*  
> *Whose vertue can not be exprest, but by an Angels quill.*  
> *Of me no lines are lou'd, nor letters are of price,*  
> *Of all which speak our English tongue, but those of thy deuice.*

> *And so mought they in their deepe skanning skill*  
> *Alow and grace our Collyns flowing quill.*
>
> * And fare befall that* Faery Queene *of thine,*  
> *in whose faire eyes loue linckt with vertue sites:*  
> *Enfusing by those bewties fyers deuine,*  
> *such high conceites into thy humble wits,*  
> *As raised hath poore pastors oaten reede,*  
> *From rustick tunes, to chaunt heroique deedes.*
>
> * So mought thy* Redcrosse *knight with happy hand*  
> *victorious be in that faire Ilands right:*

> *Elyzaes blessed field, that* Albion *hight.*  
> *That shieldes her friends, and warres her mightie foes,*
