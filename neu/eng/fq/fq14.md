*Canto I.*

> *Guyon by Archimage abusd,  
> The Redcrosse knight awaytes,  
> Findes Mordant and Amauia slaine  
> With pleasures poisoned baytes.*

> T Hat cunning Architect of cancred guile,  
> Whom Princes late displeasure left in bands,  
> For falsed letters and suborned wile,  
> Soone as the *Redcrosse* knight he vnderstands,  
> To beene departed out of *Eden* lands,  
> To serue againe his soueraine Elfin Queene,  
> His artes he moues, and out of caytiues hands  
> Himselfe he frees by secret meanes vnseene;  
> His shackles emptie left, him selfe escaped cleene.
>
> And forth he fares full of malicious mind,  
> To worken mischiefe and auenging woe,  
> Where euer he that godly knight may find,  
> His onely hart sore, and his onely foe,  
> Sith *Vna* now he algates must forgoe,  
> Whom his victorious hands did earst restore  
> To natiue crowne and kingdome late ygoe:  
> Where she enioyes sure peace for euermore,  
> As weather-beaten ship arriu'd on happie shore.
>
> Him therefore now the obiect of his spight  
> And deadly food he makes: him to offend  
> By forged treason, or by open fight  
> He seekes, of all his drift the aymed end:  
> Thereto his subtile engins he does bend  
> His practick wit, and his faire filed tong,  
> With thousand other sleights: for well he kend,  
> His credit now in doubtfull ballaunce hong;  
> For hardly could be hurt, who was already stong.
>
> Still as he went, he craftie stales did lay  
> With cunning traines him to entrap vnwares.  
> And priuie spials plast in all his way,  
> To weete what course he takes, and how he fares;  
> To ketch him at a vantage in his snares.  
> But now so wise and warie was the knight  
> By triall of his former harmes and cares,  
> That he descride, and shonned still his slight:  
> The fish that once was caught, new bait will hardly bite.
>
> Nath'lesse th'Enchaunter would not spare his paine,  
> In hope to win occasion to his will;  
> Which when he long awaited had in vaine,  
> He chaungd his minde from one to other ill:  
> For to all good he enimy was still.  
> Vpon the way him fortuned to meet,  
> Faire marching vnderneath a shady hill,  
> A goodly knight, all armd in harnesse meete,  
> That from his head no place appeared to his feete.
>
> His carriage was full comely and vpright,  
> His countenaunce demure and temperate,  
> But yet so sterne and terrible in sight,  
> That cheard his friends, and did his foes amate:  
> He was an Elfin borne of noble state,  
> And mickle worship in his natiue land;  
> Well could he tourney and in lists debate,  
> And knighthood tooke of good Sir *Huons* hand,  
> When with king *Oberon* he came to Faerie land.
>
> Him als accompanyd vpon the way  
> A comely Palmer, clad in blacke attire,  
> Of ripest yeares, and haires all hoarie gray,  
> That with a staffe his feeble steps did stire,  
> Least his long way his aged limbes should tire:  
> And if by lookes one may the mind aread,  
> He seemd to be a sage and sober sire,  
> And euer with slow pace the knight did lead,  
> Who taught his trampling steed with equall steps to tread.
>
> Such whenas *Archimago* them did view,  
> He weened well to worke some vncouth wile,  
> Eftsoones vntwisting his deceiptfull clew,  
> He gan to weaue a web of wicked guile,  
> And with faire countenance and flattring stile,  
> To them approching, thus the knight bespake:  
> Faire sonne of *Mars*, that seeke with warlike spoile.  
> And great atchieu'ments great your selfe to make,  
> Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble misers sake.
>
> He stayd his steed for humble misers sake,  
> And bad tell on the tenor of his plaint;  
> Who feigning then in euery limbe to quake,  
> Through inward feare, and seeming pale and faint  
> With piteous mone his percing speach gan paint;  
> Deare Lady how shall I declare thy cace,  
> Whom late I left in langourous constraint?  
> Would God thy selfe now present were in place,  
> To tell this ruefull tale; thy sight could win thee grace.
>
> Or rather would, O would it so had chaunst,  
> That you, most noble Sir, had present beene,  
> When that lewd ribauld with vile lust aduaunst  
> Layd first his filthy hands on virgin cleene,  
> To spoile her daintie corse so faire and sheene,  
> As on the earth, great mother of vs all,  
> With liuing eye more faire was neuer seene,  
> Of chastitie and honour virginall:  
> Witnesse ye heauẽs, whom she in vaine to helpe did call.
>
> How may it be, (said then the knight halfe wroth,)  
> That knight should knighthood euer so haue shent?  
> None but that saw (quoth he) would weene for troth,  
> How shamefully that Maid he did torment.  
> Her looser golden lockes he rudely rent,  
> And drew her on the ground, and his sharpe sword,  
> Against her snowy brest he fiercely bent,  
> And threatned death with many a bloudie word;  
> Toung hates to tell the rest, that eye to see abhord.
>
> Therewith amoued from his sober mood,  
> And liues he yet (said he) that wrought this act,  
> And doen the heauens afford him vitall food?  
> He liues, (quoth he) and boasteth of the fact,  
> Ne yet hath any knight his courage crackt.  
> Where may that treachour then (said he) be found,  
> Or by what meanes may I his footing tract?  
> That shall I shew (said he) as sure, as hound  
> The strickẽ Deare doth chalenge by the bleeding wound.
>
> He staid not lenger talke, but with fierce ire  
> And zealous hast away is quickly gone  
> To seeke that knight, where him that craftie Squire  
> Supposd to be. They do arriue anone,  
> Where sate a gentle Lady all alone,  
> With garments rent, and haire discheueled,  
> Wringing her hands, and making piteous mone;  
> Her swollen eyes were much disfigured,  
> And her faire face with teares was fowly blubbered.
>
> The knight approching nigh thus to her said,  
> Faire Ladie, through foule sorrow ill bedight,  
> Great pittie is to see you thus dismaid,  
> And marre the blossome of your beautie bright:  
> For thy appease your griefe and heauie plight,  
> And tell the cause of your conceiued paine.  
> For if he liue, that hath you doen despight,  
> He shall you doe due recompence againe,  
> Or else his wrong with greater puissance maintaine.
>
> Which when she heard, as in despightfull wise,  
> She wilfully her sorrow did augment,  
> And offred hope of comfort did despise:  
> Her golden lockes most cruelly she rent,  
> And scratcht her face with ghastly dreriment,  
> Ne would she speake, ne see, ne yet be seene,  
> But hid her visage, and her head downe bent,  
> Either for grieuous shame, or for great teene,  
> As if her hart with sorrow had transfixed beene.
>
> Till her that Squire bespake, Madame my liefe,  
> For Gods deare loue be not so wilfull bent,  
> But doe vouchsafe now to receiue reliefe,  
> The which good fortune doth to you present.  
> For what bootes it to weepe and to wayment,  
> When ill is chaunst, but doth the ill increase,  
> And the weake mind with double woe torment?  
> When she her Squire heard speake, she gan appease  
> Her voluntarie paine, and feele some secret ease.
>
> Eftsoone she said, Ah gentle trustie Squire,  
> What comfort can I wofull wretch conceaue,  
> Or why should euer I henceforth desire,  
> To see faire heauens face, and life not leaue,  
> Sith that false Traytour did my honour reaue?  
> False traytour certes (said the Faerie knight)  
> I read the man, that euer would deceaue  
> A gentle Ladie, or her wrong through might:  
> Death were too little paine for such a foule despight.
>
> But now, faire Ladie, comfort to you make,  
> And read, who hath ye wrought this shamefull plight.  
> That short reuenge the man may ouertake,  
> Where so he be, and soone vpon him light.  
> Certes (saide she) I wote not how he hight,  
> But vnder him a gray steede did he wield,  
> Whose sides with dapled circles weren dight;  
> Vpright he rode, and in his siluer shield  
> He bore a bloudie Crosse, that quartred all the field.
>
> Now by my head (said *Guyon*) much I muse,  
> How that same knight should do so foule amis,  
> Or euer gentle Damzell so abuse:  
> For may I boldly say, he surely is  
> A right good knight, and true of word ywis:  
> I present was, and can it witnesse well,  
> When armes he swore, and streight did enterpris  
> Th'aduenture of the *Errant damozell*,  
> In which he hath great glorie wonne, as I heare tell.
>
> Nathlesse he shortly shall againe be tryde,  
> And fairly quite him of th'imputed blame,  
> Else be ye sure he dearely shall abyde,  
> Or make you good amendment for the same:  
> All wrongs haue mends, but no amends of shame.  
> Now therefore Ladie, rise out of your paine,  
> And see the saluing of your blotted name.  
> Full loth she seemd thereto, but yet did faine;  
> For she was inly glad her purpose so to gaine.
>
> Her purpose was not such, as she did faine,  
> Ne yet her person such, as it was seene,  
> But vnder simple shew and semblant plaine  
> Lurckt false *Duessa* secretly vnseene,  
> As a chast Virgin, that wronged beene:  
> So had false *Archimago* her disguisd,  
> To cloke her guile with sorrow and sad teene;  
> And eke himselfe had craftily deuisd  
> To be her Squire, and do her seruice well aguisd.
>
> Her late forlorne and naked he had found,  
> Where she did wander in waste wildernesse,  
> Lurking in rockes and caues farre vnder ground,  
> And with greene mosse cou'ring her nakednesse,  
> To hide her shame and loathly filthinesse;  
> Sith her Prince *Arthur* of proud ornaments  
> And borrow'd beautie spoyld. Her nathelesse  
> Th'enchaunter finding fit for his intents,  
> Did thus reuest, and deckt with due habiliments.
>
> For all he did, was to deceiue good knights,  
> And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame,  
> To slug in slouth and sensuall delights,  
> And end their daies with irrenowmed shame.  
> And now exceeding griefe him ouercame,  
> To see the *Redcrosse* thus aduaunced hye;  
> Therefore this craftie engine he did frame,  
> Against his praise to stirre vp enmitye  
> Of such, as vertues like mote vnto him allye.
>
> So now he *Guyon* guides an vncouth way  
> Through woods & mountaines, till they came at last  
> Into a pleasant dale, that lowly lay  
> Betwixt two hils, whose high heads ouerplast,  
> The valley did with coole shade ouercast,  
> Through midst thereof a little riuer rold,  
> By which there sate a knight with helme vnlast,  
> Himselfe refreshing with the liquid cold,  
> After his trauell long, and labours manifold.
>
> Loe yonder he, cryde *Archimage* alowd,  
> That wrought the shamefull fact, which I did shew;  
> And now he doth himselfe in secret shrowd,  
> To flie the vengeance for his outrage dew;  
> But vaine: for ye shall dearely do him rew,  
> So God ye speed, and send you good successe;  
> Which we farre off will here abide to vew.  
> So they him left, inflam'd with wrathfulnesse,  
> That streight against that knight his speare he did addresse.
>
> Who seeing him from farre so fierce to pricke,  
> His warlike armes about him gan embrace,  
> And in the rest his readie speare did sticke;  
> Tho when as still he saw him towards pace,  
> He gan rencounter him in equall race.  
> They bene ymet, both readie to affrap,  
> When suddenly that warriour gan abace  
> His threatned speare, as if some new mishap  
> Had him betidde, or hidden daunger did entrap.
>
> And cryde, Mercie Sir knight, and mercie Lord,  
> For mine offence and heedlesse hardiment,  
> That had almost committed crime abhord,  
> And with reprochfull shame mine honour shent,  
> Whiles cursed steele against that badge I bent,  
> The sacred badge of my Redeemers death,  
> Which on your shield is set for ornament:  
> But his fierce foe his steede could stay vneath,  
> Who prickt with courage kene, did cruell battell breath.
>
> But when he heard him speake, streight way he knew  
> His error, and himselfe inclyning sayd;  
> Ah deare Sir *Guyon*, well becommeth you,  
> But me behoueth rather to vpbrayd,  
> Whose hastie hand so farre from reason strayd,  
> That almost it did haynous violence  
> On that faire image of that heauenly Mayd,  
> That decks and armes your shield with faire defence:  
> Your court'sie takes on you anothers due offence.
>
> So bene they both attone, and doen vpreare  
> Their beuers bright, each other for to greete;  
> Goodly comportance each to other beare,  
> And entertaine themselues with court'sies meet,  
> Then said the *Redcrosse* knight, Now mote I weet,  
> Sir *Guyon*, why with so fierce saliaunce,  
> And fell intent ye did at earst me meet;  
> For sith I know your goodly gouernaunce,  
> Great cause, I weene, you guided, or some vncouth chaunce.
>
> Certes (said he) well mote I shame to tell  
> The fond encheason, that me hither led.  
> A false infamous faitour late befell  
> Me for to meet, that seemed ill bested,  
> And playnd of grieuous outrage, which he red  
> A knight had wrought against a Ladie gent;  
> Which to auenge, he to this place me led,  
> Where you he made the marke of his intent,  
> And now is fled; foule shame him follow, where he went.
>
> So can he turne his earnest vnto game,  
> Through goodly handling and wise temperance.  
> By this his aged guide in presence came;  
> Who soone as on that knight his eye did glance,  
> Eft soones of him had perfect cognizance,  
> Sith him in Faerie court he late auizd;  
> And said, Faire sonne, God giue you happie chance,  
> And that deare Crosse vpon your shield deuizd,  
> Wherewith aboue all knights ye goodly seeme aguizd.
>
> Ioy may you haue, and euerlasting fame,  
> Of late most hard atchieu'ment by you donne,  
> For which enrolled is your glorious name  
> In heauenly Registers aboue the Sunne,  
> Where you a Saint with Saints your seat haue wonne:  
> But wretched we, where ye haue left your marke,  
> Must now anew begin, like race to runne;  
> God guide thee, *Guyon*, well to end thy warke,  
> And to the wished hauen bring thy weary barke.
>
> Palmer, (him answered the *Redcrosse* knight)  
> His be the praise, that this atchieu'ment wrought,  
> Who made my hand the organ of his might;  
> More then goodwill to me attribute nought:  
> For all I did, I did but as I ought.  
> But you, faire Sir, whose pageant next ensewes,  
> Well mote yee thee, as well can wish your thought,  
> That home ye may report thrise happie newes;  
> For well ye worthie bene for worth and gentle thewes.
>
> So courteous conge both did giue and take,  
> With right hands plighted, pledges of good will.  
> Then *Guyon* forward gan his voyage make,  
> With his blacke Palmer, that him guided still.  
> Still he him guided ouer dale and hill,  
> And with his steedie staffe did point his way:  
> His race with reason, and with words his will,  
> From foule intemperance he oft did stay,  
> And suffred not in wrath his hastie steps to stray.
>
> In this faire wize they traueild long yfere,  
> Through many hard assayes, which did betide;  
> Of which he honour still away did beare,  
> And spred his glorie through all countries wide.  
> At last as chaunst them by a forest side  
> To passe, for succour from the scorching ray,  
> They heard a ruefull voice, that dearnly cride  
> With percing shriekes, and many a dolefull lay;  
> Which to attend, a while their forward steps they stay.
>
> But if that carelesse heauens (quoth she) despise  
> The doome of iust reuenge, and take delight  
> To see sad pageants of mens miseries,  
> As bound by them to liue in liues despight,  
> Yet can they not warne death from wretched wight.  
> Come then, come soone, come sweetest death to mee,  
> And take away this long lent loathed light:  
> Sharpe by thy wounds, but sweet the medicines bee,  
> That long captiued soules from wearie thraldome free.
>
> But thou, sweet Babe, whom frowning froward fate  
> Hath made sad witnesse of thy fathers fall,  
> Sith heauen thee deignes to hold in liuing state,  
> Long maist thou liue, and better thriue withall,  
> Then to thy lucklesse parents did befall:  
> Liue thou, and to thy mother dead attest,  
> That cleare she dide from blemish criminall;  
> Thy litle hands embrewd in bleeding brest  
> Loe I for pledges leaue. So giue me leaue to rest.
>
> With that a deadly shrieke she forth did throw,  
> That through the wood reecchoed againe,  
> And after gaue a grone so deepe and low,  
> That seemd her tender heart was rent in twaine,  
> Or thrild with point of thorough piercing paine;  
> As gentle Hynd, whose sides with cruell steele  
> Through launched, forth her bleeding life does raine,  
> Whiles the sad pang approching she does feele,  
> Brayes out her latest breath, and vp her eyes doth seele.
>
> Which when that warriour heard, dismounting straict  
> From his tall steed, he rusht into the thicke,  
> And soone arriued, where that sad pourtraict  
> Of death and labour lay, halfe dead, halfe quicke,  
> In whose white alabaster brest did sticke  
> A cruell knife, that made a griesly wound,  
> From which forth gusht a streme of gorebloud thick,  
> That all her goodly garments staind around,  
> And into a deepe sanguine dide the grassie ground.
>
> Pittifull spectacle of deadly smart,  
> Beside a bubbling fountaine low she lay,  
> Which she increased with her bleeding hart,  
> And the cleane waues with purple gore did ray;  
> Als in her lap a louely babe did play  
> His cruell sport, in stead of sorrow dew;  
> For in her streaming blood he did embay  
> His litle hands, and tender ioynts embrew;  
> Pitifull spectacle, as euer eye did view.
>
> Besides them both, vpon the soiled gras  
> The dead corse of an armed knight was spred,  
> Whose armour all with bloud besprinckled was;  
> His ruddie lips did smile, and rosy red  
> Did paint his chearefull cheekes, yet being ded,  
> Seemd to haue beene a goodly personage,  
> Now in his freshest flowre of lustie hed,  
> Fit to inflame faire Lady with loues rage,  
> But that fiers fate did crop the blossome of his age.
>
> Whom when the good Sir *Guyon* did behold,  
> His hart gan wexe as starke, as marble stone,  
> And his fresh bloud did frieze with fearefull cold,  
> That all his senses seemd bereft attone:  
> At last his mightie ghost gan deepe to grone,  
> As Lyon grudging in his great disdaine,  
> Mournes inwardly, and makes to himselfe mone:  
> Till ruth and fraile affection did constraine,  
> His stout courage to stoupe, and shew his inward paine.
>
> Out of her gored wound the cruell steele  
> He lightly snatcht, and did the floudgate stop  
> With his faire garment: then gan softly feele  
> Her feeble pulse, to proue if any drop  
> Of liuing bloud yet in her veynes did hop;  
> Which when he felt to moue, he hoped faire  
> To call backe life to her forsaken shop;  
> So well he did her deadly wounds repaire,  
> That at the last she gan to breath out liuing aire.
>
> Which he perceiuing greatly gan reioice,  
> And goodly counsell, that for wounded hart  
> Is meetest med'cine, tempred with sweet voice;  
> Ay me, deare Lady, which the image art  
> Of ruefull pitie, and impatient smart,  
> What direfull chance, armd with reuenging fate,  
> Or cursed hand hath plaid this cruell part,  
> Thus fowle to hasten your vntimely date;  
> Speake, O deare Lady speake: help neuer comes too late.
>
> Therewith her dim eie-lids she vp gan reare,  
> On which the drery death did sit, as sad  
> As lump of lead, and made darke clouds appeare;  
> But when as him all in bright armour clad  
> Before her standing she espied had,  
> As one out of a deadly dreame affright,  
> She weakely started, yet she nothing drad:  
> Streight downe againe her selfe in great despight  
> She groueling threw to ground, as hating life and light.
>
> The gentle knight her soone with carefull paine  
> Vplifted light, and softly did vphold:  
> Thrise he her reard, and thrise she sunke againe,  
> Till he his armes about her sides gan fold,  
> And to her said; Yet if the stony cold  
> Haue not all seized on your frozen hart,  
> Let one word fall that may your griefe vnfold,  
> And tell the secret of your mortall smart;  
> He oft finds present helpe, who does his griefe impart.
>
> Then casting vp a deadly looke, full low,  
> Shee sight from bottome of her wounded brest,  
> And after, many bitter throbs did throw  
> With lips full pale and foltring tongue opprest,  
> These words she breathed forth from riuen chest;  
> Leaue, ah leaue off, what euer wight thou bee,  
> To let a wearie wretch from her dew rest,  
> And trouble dying soules tranquilitee.  
> Take not away now got, which none would giue to me.
>
> Ah farre be it (said he) Deare dame fro mee,  
> To hinder soule from her desired rest,  
> Or hold sad life in long captiuitee:  
> For all I seeke, is but to haue redrest  
> The bitter pangs, that doth your heart infest.  
> Tell then, ô Lady tell, what fatall priefe  
> Hath with so huge misfortune you opprest?  
> That I may cast to compasse your reliefe,  
> Or die with you in sorrow, and partake your griefe.
>
> With feeble hands then stretched forth on hye,  
> As heauen accusing guiltie of her death,  
> And with dry drops congealed in her eye,  
> In these sad words she spent her vtmost breath:  
> Heare then, ô man, the sorrowes that vneath  
> My tongue can tell, so farre all sense they pas:  
> Loe this dead corpse, that lies here vnderneath,  
> The gentlest knight, that euer on greene gras  
> Gay steed with spurs did pricke, the good Sir *Mortdant* was.
>
> Was, (ay the while, that he is not so now)  
> My Lord my loue; my deare Lord, my deare loue,  
> So long as heauens iust with equall brow  
> Vouchsafed to behold vs from aboue,  
> One day when him high courage did emmoue,  
> As wont ye knights to seeke aduentures wilde,  
> He pricked forth, his puissant force to proue,  
> Me then he left enwombed of this child,  
> This lucklesse child, whom thus ye see with bloud defild.
>
> Him fortuned (hard fortune ye may ghesse)  
> To come, where vile *Acrasia* does wonne,  
> *Acrasia* a false enchaunteresse,  
> That many errant knights hath foule fordonne:  
> Within a wandring Island, that doth ronne  
> And stray in perilous gulfe, her dwelling is:  
> Faire Sir, if euer there ye trauell, shonne  
> The cursed land where many wend amis,  
> And know it by the name; it hight the *Bowre of blis*.
>
> Her blisse is all in pleasure and delight,  
> Wherewith she makes her louers drunken mad,  
> And then with words & weedes of wondrous might,  
> On them she workes her will to vses bad:  
> My lifest Lord she thus beguiled had;  
> For he was flesh: (all flesh doth frailtie breed.)  
> Whom when I heard to beene so ill bestad,  
> Weake wretch I wrapt my selfe in Palmers weed,  
> And cast to seeke him forth through daunger and great dreed.
>
> Now had faire *Cynthia* by euen tournes  
> Full measured three quarters of her yeare,  
> And thrise three times had fild her crooked hornes,  
> Whenas my wombe her burdein would forbeare,  
> And bad me call *Lucina* to me neare.  
> *Lucina* came: a manchild forth I brought:  
> The woods, the Nymphes, my bowres, my midwiues weare,  
> Hard helpe at need. So deare thee babe I bought,  
> Yt nought too deare I deemd, while so my dear I sought.
>
> Him so I sought, and so at last I found  
> Where him that witch had thralled to her will,  
> In chaines of lust and lewd desires ybound,  
> And so transformed from his former skill,  
> That me he knew not, neither his owne ille;  
> Till through wise handling and faire gouernance,  
> I him recured to a better will,  
> Purged from drugs of foule intemperance:  
> Then meanes I gan deuise for his deliuerance.
>
> Which when the vile Enchaunteresse perceiu'd,  
> How that my Lord from her I would repriue,  
> With cup thus charmd, him parting she deceiu'd;  
> *Sad verse, giue death to him that death does giue,  
> And losse of loue, to her that loues to liue,  
> So soone as Bacchus with the Nymphe does lincke:*  
> So parted we and on our iourney driue,  
> Till comming to this well, he stoupt to drincke:  
> The charme fulfild, dead suddenly he downe did sincke.
>
> Which when I wretch,---Not one word more she sayd  
> But breaking off, the end for want of breath,  
> And slyding soft, as downe to sleepe her layd,  
> And ended all her woe in quiet death.  
> That seeing good Sir *Guyon*, could vneath  
> From teares abstaine, for griefe his hart did grate,  
> And from so heauie sight his head did wreath,  
> Accusing fortune, and too cruell fate,  
> Which plunged had faire Ladie in so wretched state.
>
> Then turning to his Palmer said, Old syre  
> Behold the image of mortalitie,  
> And feeble nature cloth'd with fleshly tyre,  
> When raging passion with fierce tyrannie  
> Robs reason of her due regalitie  
> And makes it seruant to her basest part:  
> The strong it weakens with infirmitie,  
> And with bold furie armes the weakest hart;  
> The strong through pleasure soonest falles, the weake through smart.
>
> But temperance (said he) with golden squire  
> Betwixt them both can measure out a meane,  
> Neither to melt in pleasures whot desire,  
> Nor fry in hartlesse griefe and dolefull teene.  
> Thrise happie man, who fares them both atweene:  
> But sith this wretched woman ouercome  
> Of anguish, rather then of crime hath beene,  
> Reserue her cause to her eternall doome,  
> And in the meane vouchsafe her honorable toombe.
>
> Palmer (quoth he) death is an equall doome  
> To good and bad, the common Inne of rest;  
> But after death the tryall is to come,  
> When best shall be to them, that liued best:  
> But both alike, when death hath both supprest,  
> Religious reuerence doth buriall teene,  
> Which who so wants, wants so much of his rest;  
> For all so great shame after death I weene,  
> As selfe to dyen bad, vnburied bad to beene.
>
> So both agree their bodies to engraue;  
> The great earthes wombe they open to the sky,  
> And with sad Cypresse seemely it embraue,  
> Then couering with a clod their closed eye,  
> They lay therein those corses tenderly,  
> And bid them sleepe in euerlasting peace.  
> But ere they did their vtmost obsequy,  
> Sir *Guyon* more affection to increace,  
> Bynempt a sacred vow, which none should aye releace.
>
> The dead knights sword out of his sheath he drew,  
> With which he cut a locke of all their heare,  
> Which medling with their bloud and earth, he threw  
> Into the graue, and gan deuoutly sweare;  
> Such and such euill God on *Guyon* reare,  
> And worse and worse young Orphane be thy paine,  
> If I or thou dew vengeance doe forbeare,  
> Till guiltie bloud her guerdon doe obtaine:  
> So shedding many teares, they closd the earth againe.
