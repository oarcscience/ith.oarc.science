<blockquote> 
<i>Scudamour doth his conquest tell,<br>
Of vertuous Amoret:<br>
Great Venus Temple is describ'd,<br>
And louers life forth set.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
T
Rue he it said, what euer man it sayd,<br>
That loue with gall and hony doth abound,<br>
But if the one be with the other wayd,<br>
For euery dram of hony therein found,<br>
A pound of gall doth ouer it redound.<br>
That I too true by triall haue approued:<br>
For since the day that first with deadly wound<br>
My heart was launcht, and learned to haue loued,<br>
I neuer ioyed howre, but still with care was moued.<p>

And yet such grace is giuen them from aboue,<br>
That all the cares and euill which they meet,<br>
May nought at all their setled mindes remoue,<br>
But seeme gainst common sence to them most sweet;<br>
As bosting in their martyrdome vnmeet.<br>
So all that euer yet I haue endured,<br>
I count as naught, and tread downe vnder feet,<br>
Since of my loue at length I rest assured,<br>
That to disloyalty she will not be allured.<p>

Long were to tell the trauell and long toile,<br>
Through which this shield of loue I late haue wonne,<br>
And purchased this peerelesse beauties spoile,<br>
That harder may be ended, then begonne.<br>
But since ye so desire, your will be donne.<br>
Then hearke ye gentle knights and Ladies free,<br>
My hard mishaps, that ye may learne to shonne;<br>
For though sweet loue to conquer glorious be,<br>
Yet is the paine thereof much greater then the fee.<p>

What time the fame of this renowmed prise<br>
Flew first abroad, and all mens eares possest,<br>
I hauing armes then taken, gan auise<br>
To winne me honour by some noble gest,<br>
And purchase me some place amongst the best.<br>
I boldly thought (so young mens thoughts are bold)<br>
That this same braue emprize for me did rest,<br>
And that both shield and she whom I behold,<br>
Might be my lucky lot; sith all by lot we hold.<p>

So on that hard aduenture forth I went,<br>
And to the place of perill shortly came.<br>
That was a temple faire and auncient,<br>
Which of great mother <i>Venus</i> bare the name,<br>
And farre renowmed through exceeding fame;<br>
Much more then that, which was in <i>Paphos</i> built,<br>
Or that in <i>Cyprus</i>, both long since this same,<br>
Though all the pillours of the one were guilt,<br>
And all the others pauement were with yuory spilt.<p>

And it was seated in an Island strong,<br>
Abounding all with delices most rare,<br>
And wall'd by nature gainst inuaders wrong,<br>
That none mote haue accesse, nor inward fare,<br>
But by one way, that passage did prepare.<br>
It was a bridge ybuilt in goodly wize,<br>
With curious Corbes and pendants grauen faire,<br>
And arched all with porches, did arize<br>
On stately pillours, fram'd after the Doricke guize.<p>

And for defence thereof, on th'other end<br>
There reared was a castle faire and strong,<br>
That warded all which in or out did wend,<br>
And flancked both the bridges sides along,<br>
Gainst all that would it faine to force or wrong.<br>
And therein wonned twenty valiant Knights;<br>
All twenty tride in warres experience long;<br>
Whose office was, against all manner wights<br>
By all meanes to maintaine that castels ancient rights.<p>

Before that Castle was an open plaine,<br>
And in the midst thereof a piller placed;<br>
On which this shield, of many sought in vaine,<br>
The shield of Loue, whose guerdon me hath graced,<br>
Was hangd on high with golden ribbands laced;<br>
And in the marble stone was written this,<br>
With golden letters goodly well enchaced,<br>
<i>Blessed the man that well can vse his blis:</i><br>
<i>VVhose euer be the shield, faire Amoret be his.</i><p>

Which when I red, my heart did inly earne,<br>
And pant with hope of that aduentures hap:<br>
Ne stayed further newes thereof to learne,<br>
But with my speare vpon the shield did rap,<br>
That all the castle ringed with the clap.<br>
Streight forth issewd a Knight all arm'd to proofe,<br>
And brauely mounted to his most mishap:<br>
Who staying nought to question from aloofe,<br>
Ran fierce at me, that fire glaunst from his horses hoofe.<p>

Whom boldly I encountred (as I could)<br>
And by good fortune shortly him vnseated.<br>
Eftsoones out sprung two more of equall mould;<br>
But I them both with equall hap defeated:<br>
So all the twenty I likewise entreated,<br>
And left them groning there vpon the plaine.<br>
Then preacing to the pillour I repeated<br>
The read thereof for guerdon of my paine,<br>
And taking downe the shield, with me did it retaine.<p>

So forth without impediment I past,<br>
Till to the Bridges vtter gate I came:<br>
The which I found sure lockt and chained fast.<br>
I knockt, but no man aunswred me by name;<br>
I cald, but no man answerd to my clame.<br>
Yet I perseuer'd still to knocke and call,<br>
Till at the last I spide within the same,<br>
Where one stood peeping through a creuis small,<br>
To whom I cald aloud, halfe angry therewithall.<p>

That was to weet the Porter of the place,<br>
Vnto whose trust the charge thereof was lent:<br>
His name was <i>Doubt</i>, that had a double face,<br>
Th'one forward looking, th'other backeward bent,<br>
Therein resembling <i>Ianus</i> auncient,<br>
Which hath in charge the ingate of the yeare:<br>
And euermore his eyes about him went,<br>
As if some proued perill he did feare,<br>
Or did misdoubt some ill, whose cause did not appeare.<p>

On th'one side he, on th'other sate <i>Delay</i>,<br>
Behinde the gate, that none her might espy;<br>
Whose manner was all passengers to stay,<br>
And entertaine with her occasions sly,<br>
Through which some lost great hope vnheedily,<br>
Which neuer they recouer might againe;<br>
And others quite excluded forth, did ly<br>
Long languishing there in vnpittied paine,<br>
And seeking often entraunce, afterwards in vaine.<p>

Me when as he had priuily espide,<br>
Bearing the shield which I had conquerd late,<br>
He kend it streight, and to me opened wide.<br>
So in I past, and streight he closd the gate.<br>
But being in, <i>Delay</i> in close awaite<br>
Caught hold on me, and thought my steps to stay,<br>
Feigning full many a fond excuse to prate,<br>
And time to steale, the threasure of mans day;<br>
Whose smallest minute lost, no riches render may.<p>

But by no meanes my way I would forslow,<br>
For ought that euer she could doe or say,<br>
But from my lofty steede dismounting low,<br>
Past forth on foote, beholding all the way<br>
The goodly workes, and stones of rich assay,<br>
Cast into sundry shapes by wondrous skill,<br>
That like on earth no where I recken may:<br>
And vnderneath, the riuer rolling still<br>
With murmure soft, that seem'd to serue the workmans will.<p>

Thence forth I passed to the second gate,<br>
The <i>Gate of good desert</i>, whose goodly pride<br>
And costly frame, were long here to relate.<br>
The same to all stoode alwaies open wide:<br>
But in the Porch did euermore abide<br>
An hideous Giant, dreadfull to behold,<br>
That stopt the entraunce with his spacious stride,<br>
And with the terrour of his countenance bold<br>
Full many did affray, that else faine enter would.<p>

His name was <i>Daunger</i> dreaded ouer all,<br>
Who day and night did watch and duely ward,<br>
From fearefull cowards, entrance to forstall,<br>
And faint-heart-fooles, whom shew of perill hard<br>
Could terrifie from Fortunes faire adward:<br>
For oftentimes faint hearts at first espiall<br>
Of his grim face, were from approaching scard;<br>
Vnworthy they of grace, whom one deniall<br>
Excludes from fairest hope, withouten further triall.<p>

Yet many doughty warriours, often tride<br>
In greater perils to be stout and bold,<br>
Durst not the sternnesse of his looke abide,<br>
But soone as they his countenance did behold,<br>
Began to faint, and feele their corage cold.<br>
Againe some other, that in hard assaies<br>
Were cowards knowne, and litle count did hold,<br>
Either through gifts, or guile, or such like waies,<br>
Crept in by stouping low, or stealing of the kaies.<p>

But I though meanest man of many moe,<br>
Yet much disdaining vnto him to lout,<br>
Or creepe betweene his legs, so in to goe,<br>
Resolu'd him to assault with manhood stout,<br>
And either beat him in, or driue him out.<br>
Eftsoones aduauncing that enchaunted shield,<br>
With all my might I gan to lay about:<br>
Which when he saw, the glaiue which he did wield<br>
He gan forthwith t'auale, and way vnto me yield.<p>

So as I entred, I did backeward looke,<br>
For feare of harme, that might lie hidden there;<br>
And loe his hindparts, whereof heed I tooke,<br>
Much more deformed fearefull vgly were,<br>
Then all his former parts did earst appere.<br>
For hatred, murther, treason, and despight,<br>
With many moe lay in ambushment there,<br>
Awayting to entrap the warelesse wight,<br>
Which did not them preuent with vigilant foresight.<p>

Thus hauing past all perill, I was come<br>
Within the compasse of that Islands space;<br>
The which did seeme vnto my simple doome,<br>
The onely pleasant and delightfull place,<br>
That euer troden was of footings trace.<br>
For all that nature by her mother wit<br>
Could frame in earth, and forme of substance base,<br>
Was there, and all that nature did omit,<br>
Art playing second natures part, supplyed it.<p>

No tree, that is of count, in greenewood growes,<br>
From lowest Iuniper to Ceder tall,<br>
No flowre in field, that daintie odour throwes,<br>
And deckes his branch with blossomes ouer all,<br>
But there was planted, or grew naturall:<br>
Nor sense of man so coy and curious nice,<br>
But there mote find to please it selfe withall;<br>
Nor hart could wish for any queint deuice,<br>
But there it present was, and did fraile sense entice.<p>

In such luxurious plentie of all pleasure,<br>
It seem'd a second paradise to ghesse,<br>
So lauishly enricht with natures threasure,<br>
That if the happie soules, which doe possesse<br>
Th'Elysian fields, and liue in lasting blesse,<br>
Should happen this with liuing eye to see,<br>
They soone would loath their lesser happinesse,<br>
And wish to life return'd againe to bee,<br>
That in this ioyous place they mote haue ioyance free.<p>

Fresh shadowes, fit to shroud from sunny ray;<br>
Faire lawnds, to take the sunne in season dew;<br>
Sweet springs, in which a thousand Nymphs did play;<br>
Soft rombling brookes, that gentle slomber drew;<br>
High reared mounts, the lands about to vew;<br>
Low looking dales, disloignd from common gaze;<br>
Delightfull bowres, to solace louers trew;<br>
False Labyrinthes, fond runners eyes to daze;<br>
All which by nature made did nature selfe amaze.<p>

And all without were walkes and alleyes dight,<br>
With diuers trees, enrang'd in euen rankes;<br>
And here and there were pleasant arbors pight,<br>
And shadie seates, and sundry flowring bankes,<br>
To sit and rest the walkers wearie shankes,<br>
And therein thousand payres of louers walkt,<br>
Praysing their god, and yeelding him great thankes,<br>
Ne euer ought but of their true loues talkt,<br>
Ne euer for rebuke or blame of any balkt.<p>

All these together by themselves did sport<br>
Their spotlesse pleasures, and sweet loues content.<br>
But farre away from these, another sort<br>
Of louers lincked in true harts consent;<br>
Which loued not as these, for like intent,<br>
But on chast vertue grounded their desire,<br>
Farre from all fraud, or fayned blandishment;<br>
Which in their spirits kindling zealous fire,<br>
Braue thoughts and noble deedes did euermore aspire.<p>

Such were great <i>Hercules</i>, and <i>Hylas</i> deare;<br>
Trew <i>Ionathan</i>, and <i>Dauid</i> trustie tryde;<br>
Stout <i>Theseus</i>, and <i>Pirithous</i> his feare;<br>
<i>Pylades</i> and <i>Orestes</i> by his syde;<br>
Myld <i>Titus</i> and <i>Gesippus</i> without pryde;<br>
<i>Damon</i> and <i>Pythias</i> whom death could not seuer;<br>
All these and all that euer had bene tyde,<br>
In bands of friendship, there did liue for euer,<br>
Whose liues although decay'd, yet loues decayed neuer.<p>

Which when as I, that neuer tasted blis,<br>
Nor happie howre, beheld with gazefull eye,<br>
I thought there was none other heauen then this;<br>
And gan their endlesse happinesse enuye,<br>
That being free from feare and gealosye,<br>
Might frankely there their loues desire possesse;<br>
Whilest I through paines and perlous ieopardie,<br>
Was forst to seeke my lifes deare patronesse:<br>
Much dearer be the things, which come through hard distresse.<p>

Yet all those sights, and all that else I saw,<br>
Might not my steps withhold, but that forthright<br>
Vnto that purposd place I did me draw,<br>
Where as my loue was lodged day and night:<br>
The temple of great <i>Venus</i>, that is hight<br>
The Queene of beautie, and of loue the mother,<br>
There worshipped of euery liuing wight;<br>
Whose goodly workmanship farre past all other<br>
That euer were on earth, all were they set together.<p>

Not that same famous Temple of <i>Diane</i>,<br>
Whose hight all <i>Ephesus</i> did ouersee,<br>
And which all <i>Asia</i> sought with vowes prophane,<br>
One of the worlds seuen wonders sayd to bee,<br>
Might match with this by many a degree:<br>
Nor that, which that wise King of <i>Iurie</i> framed,<br>
With endlesse cost, to be th'Almighties see;<br>
Nor all that else through all the world is named<br>
To all the heathen Gods, might like to this be clamed.<p>

I much admyring that so goodly frame,<br>
Vnto the porch approcht, which open stood;<br>
But therein sate an amiable Dame,<br>
That seem'd to be of very sober mood,<br>
And in her semblant shewed great womanhood:<br>
Strange was her tyre; for on her head a crowne<br>
She wore much like vnto a Danisk hood<br>
Poudred with pearle and stone, and all her gowne<br>
Enwouen was with gold, that raught full low a downe.<p>

On either side of her, two young men stood,<br>
Both strongly arm'd, as fearing one another;<br>
Yet were they brethren both of halfe the blood,<br>
Begotten by two fathers of one mother,<br>
Though of contrarie natures each to other:<br>
The one of them hight <i>Loue</i>, the other <i>Hate</i>,<br>
<i>Hate</i> was the elder, <i>Loue</i> the younger brother;<br>
Yet was the younger stronger in his state<br>
Then th'elder, and him maystred still in all debate.<p>

Nathlesse that Dame so well them tempred both,<br>
That she them forced hand to ioyne in hand,<br>
Albe that <i>Hatred</i> was thereto full loth,<br>
And turn'd his face away, as he did stand,<br>
Vnwilling to behold that louely band.<br>
Yet she was of such grace and vertuous might,<br>
That her commaundment he could not withstand,<br>
But bit his lip for felonous despight,<br>
And gnasht his yron tuskes at that displeasing sight.<p>

<i>Concord</i> she cleeped was in common reed,<br>
Mother of blessed <i>Peace</i>, and <i>Friendship</i> trew;<br>
They both her twins, both borne of heauenly seed,<br>
And she her selfe likewise diuinely grew;<br>
The which right well her workes diuine did shew:<br>
For strength, and wealth, and happinesse she lends,<br>
And strife, and warre, and anger does subdew:<br>
Of litle much, of foes she maketh frends,<br>
And to afflicted minds sweet rest and quiet sends.<p>

By her the heauen is in his course contained,<br>
And all the world in state vnmoued stands,<br>
As their Almightie maker first ordained,<br>
And bound them with inuiolable bands;<br>
Else would the waters ouerflow the lands,<br>
And fire deuoure the ayre, and hell them quight,<br>
But that she holds them with her blessed hands.<br>
She is the nourse of pleasure and delight,<br>
And vnto <i>Venus</i> grace the gate doth open right.<p>

By her I entring halfe dismayed was,<br>
But she in gentle wise me entertayned,<br>
And twixt her selfe and <i>Loue</i> did let me pas;<br>
But <i>Hatred</i> would my entrance haue restrayned,<br>
And with his club me threatned to haue brayned,<br>
Had not the Ladie with her powrefull speach<br>
Him from his wicked will vneath refrayned;<br>
And th'other eke his malice did empeach,<br>
Till I was throughly past the perill of his reach.<p>

Into the inmost Temple thus I came,<br>
Which fuming all with frankensence I found,<br>
And odours rising from the altars flame.<br>
Vpon an hundred marble pillors round<br>
The roofe vp high was reared from the ground,<br>
All deckt with crownes, &amp; chaynes, and girlands gay,<br>
And thousand pretious gifts worth many a pound,<br>
The which sad louers for their vowes did pay;<br>
And all the ground was strow'd with flowres, as fresh as May.<p>

An hundred Altars round about were set,<br>
All flaming with their sacrifices fire,<br>
That with the steme thereof the Temple swet,<br>
Which rould in clouds to heauen did aspire,<br>
And in them bore true louers vowes entire:<br>
And eke an hundred brasen caudrons bright,<br>
To bath in ioy and amorous desire,<br>
Euery of which was to a damzell hight;<br>
For all the Priests were damzels, in soft linnen dight.<p>

Right in the midst the Goddesse selfe did stand<br>
Vpon an altar of some costly masse,<br>
Whose substance was vneath to vnderstand:<br>
For neither pretious stone, nor durefull brasse,<br>
For shining gold, nor mouldring clay it was;<br>
But much more rare and pretious to esteeme,<br>
Pure in aspect, and like to christall glasse,<br>
Yet glasse was not, if one did rightly deeme,<br>
But being faire and brickle, likest glasse did seeme.<p>

But it in shape and beautie did excell<br>
All other Idoles, which the heathen adore<br>
Farre passing that, which by surpassing skill<br>
<i>Phidias</i> did make in <i>Paphos</i> Isle of yore,<br>
With which that wretched Greeke, that life forlore<br>
Did fall in loue: yet this much fairer shined,<br>
But couered with a slender veile afore;<br>
And both her feete and legs together twyned<br>
Were with a snake, whose head &amp; tail were fast c&otilde;byned.<p>

The cause why she was couered with a vele,<br>
Was hard to know, for that her Priests the same<br>
From peoples knowledge labour'd to concele.<br>
But sooth it was not sure for womanish shame,<br>
Nor any blemish, which the worke mote blame;<br>
But for, they say, she hath both kinds in one,<br>
Both male and female, both vnder one name:<br>
She syre and mother is her selfe alone,<br>
Begets and eke conceiues, ne needeth other none.<p>

And all about her necke and shoulders flew<br>
A flocke of litle loues, and sports, and ioyes,<br>
With nimble wings of gold and purple hew;<br>
Whose shapes seem'd not like to terrestriall boyes,<br>
But like to Angels playing heauenly toyes;<br>
The whilest their eldest brother was away,<br>
<i>Cupid</i> their eldest brother; he enioyes<br>
The wide kingdome of loue with Lordly sway,<br>
And to his law compels all creatures to obay.<p>

And all about her altar scattered lay<br>
Great sorts of louers piteously complayning,<br>
Some of their losse, some of their loues delay,<br>
Some of their pride, some paragons disdayning,<br>
Some fearing fraud, some fraudulently fayning,<br>
As euery one had cause of good or ill.<br>
Amongst the rest some one through loues constrayning,<br>
Tormented sore, could not containe it still,<br>
But thus brake forth, that all the temple it did fill.<p>

Great <i>Venus</i>, Queene of beautie and of grace,<br>
The ioy of Gods and men, that vnder skie<br>
Doest fayrest shine, and most adorne thy place,<br>
That with thy smyling looke doest pacifie<br>
The raging seas, and makst the stormes to flie;<br>
Thee goddesse, thee the winds, the clouds doe feare,<br>
And when thou spredst thy mantle forth on hie,<br>
The waters play and pleasant lands appeare,<br>
And heauens laugh, &amp; all the world shews ioyous cheare.<p>

Then doth the d&aelig;dale earth throw forth to thee<br>
Out of her fruitfull lap aboundant flowres,<br>
And then all liuing wights, soone as they see<br>
The spring breake forth out of his lusty bowres,<br>
They all doe learne to play the Paramours;<br>
First doe the merry birds, thy prety pages<br>
Priuily pricked with thy lustfull powres,<br>
Chirpe loud to thee out of their leauy cages,<br>
And thee their mother call to coole their kindly rages.<p>

Then doe the saluage beasts begin to play<br>
Their pleasant friskes, and loath their wonted food;<br>
The Lyons rore, the Tygres loudly bray,<br>
The raging Buls rebellow through the wood,<br>
And breaking forth, dare tempt the deepest flood,<br>
To come where thou doest draw them with desire:<br>
So all things else, that nourish vitall blood,<br>
Soone as with fury thou doest them inspire,<br>
In generation seeke to quench their inward fire.<p>

So all the world by thee at first was made,<br>
And dayly yet thou doest the same repayre:<br>
Ne ought on earth that merry is and glad,<br>
Ne ought on earth that louely is and fayre,<br>
But thou the same for pleasure didst prepayre.<br>
Thou art the root of all that ioyous is,<br>
Great God of men and women, queene of th'ayre,<br>
Mother of laughter, and welspring of blisse,<br>
O graunt that of my loue at last I may not misse.<p>

So did he say: but I with murmure soft,<br>
That none might heare the sorrow of my hart,<br>
Yet inly groning deepe and sighing oft,<br>
Besought her to graunt ease vnto my smart,<br>
And to my wound her gratious help impart.<br>
Whilest thus I spake, behold with happy eye<br>
I spyde, where at the Idoles feet apart<br>
A beuie of fayre damzels close did lye,<br>
Wayting when as the Antheme should be sung on hye.<p>

The first of them did seeme of ryper yeares,<br>
And grauer countenance then all the rest;<br>
Yet all the rest were eke her equall peares,<br>
Yet vnto her obayed all the best.<br>
Her name was <i>VVomanhood</i>, that she exprest<br>
By her sad semblant and demeanure wyse:<br>
For stedfast still her eyes did fixed rest,<br>
Ne rov'd at randon after gazers guyse,<br>
Whose luring baytes oftimes doe heedlesse harts entyse.<p>

And next to her sate goodly <i>Shamefastnesse</i>,<br>
Ne euer durst her eyes from ground vpreare,<br>
Ne euer once did looke vp from her desse,<br>
As if some blame of euill she did feare,<br>
That in her cheekes made roses oft appeare:<br>
And her against sweet <i>Cherefulnesse</i> was placed,<br>
Whose eyes like twinkling stars in euening cleare,<br>
Were deckt with smyles, that all sad humors chaced,<br>
And darted forth delights, the which her goodly graced.<p>

And next to her sate sober <i>Modestie</i>,<br>
Holding her hand vpon her gentle hart;<br>
And her against sate comely <i>Curtesie</i>,<br>
That vnto euery person knew her part;<br>
And her before was seated ouerthwart<br>
Soft <i>Silence</i>, and submisse <i>Obedience</i>,<br>
Both linckt together neuer to dispart,<br>
Both gifts of God not gotten but from thence,<br>
Both girlonds of his Saints against their foes offence.<p>

Thus sate they all a round in seemely rate:<br>
And in the midst of them a goodly mayd,<br>
Euen in the lap of <i>VVomanhood</i> there sate,<br>
The which was all in lilly white arayd,<br>
With siluer streames amongst the linnen stray'd;<br>
Like to the Morne, when first her shyning face<br>
Hath to the gloomy world it selfe bewray'd,<br>
That same was fayrest <i>Amoret</i> in place,<br>
Shyning with beauties light, and heauenly vertues grace.<p>

Whom soone as I beheld, my hart gan throb,<br>
And wade in doubt, what best were to be donne:<br>
For sacrilege me seem'd the Church to rob,<br>
And folly seem'd to leaue the thing vndonne,<br>
Which with so strong attempt I had begonne.<br>
Tho shaking off all doubt and shamefast feare,<br>
Which Ladies loue I heard had neuer wonne<br>
Mongst men of worth, I to her stepped neare,<br>
And by the lilly hand her labour'd vp to reare.<p>

Thereat that formost matrone me did blame,<br>
And sharpe rebuke, for being ouer bold;<br>
Saying it was to Knight vnseemely shame,<br>
Vpon a recluse Virgin to lay hold,<br>
That vnto <i>Venus</i> seruices was sold.<br>
To whom I thus, Nay but it fitteth best,<br>
For <i>Cupids</i> man with <i>Venus</i> mayd to hold,<br>
For ill your goddesse seruices are drest<br>
By virgins, and her sacrifices let to rest.<p>

With that my shield I forth to her did show,<br>
Which all that while I closely had conceld;<br>
On which when <i>Cupid</i> with his killing bow<br>
And cruell shafts emblazond she beheld,<br>
At sight thereof she was with terror queld,<br>
And said no more: but I which all that while<br>
The pledge of faith, her hand engaged held,<br>
Like warie Hynd within the weedie soyle,<br>
For no intreatie would forgoe so glorious spoyle.<p>

And euermore vpon the Goddesse face<br>
Mine eye was fixt, for feare of her offence:<br>
Whom when I saw with amiable grace<br>
To laugh at me, and fauour my pretence,<br>
I was emboldned with more confidence;<br>
And nought for nicenesse nor for enuy sparing,<br>
In presence of them all forth led her thence:<br>
All looking on, and like astonisht staring,<br>
Yet to lay hand on her, not one of all them daring.<p>

She often prayd, and often me besought,<br>
Sometime with tender teares to let her goe,<br>
Sometime with witching smyles: but yet for nought,<br>
That euer she to me could say or doe,<br>
Could she her wished freedome fro me wooe;<br>
But forth I led her through the Temple gate,<br>
By which I hardly past with much adoe:<br>
But that same Ladie which me friended late<br>
In entrance, did me also friend in my retrate.<p>

No lesse did <i>Daunger</i> threaten me with dread,<br>
When as he saw me, maugre all his powre,<br>
That glorious spoyle of beautie with me lead,<br>
Then <i>Cerberus</i>, when <i>Orpheus</i> did recoure<br>
His Leman from the Stygian Princes boure.<br>
But euermore my shield did me defend,<br>
Against the storme of euery dreadfull stoure:<br>
Thus safely with my loue I thence did wend.<br>
So ended he his tale, where I this Canto end.<p>
