*Cant. XII.*

> *Fayre Pastorella by great hap  
> her parents vnderstands:  
> Calidore doth the Blatant beast  
> subdew, and bynd in bands.*

> L Ike as a ship, that through the Ocean wyde  
> Directs her course vnto one certaine cost,  
> Is met of many a counter winde and tyde,  
> With which her winged speed is let and crost,  
> And she her selfe in stormie surges tost;  
> Yet making many a borde, and many a bay,  
> Still winneth way, ne hath her compasse lost:  
> Right so it fares with me in this long way,  
> Whose course is often stayd, yet neuer is astray.
>
> For all that hetherto hath long delayd  
> This gentle knight, from sewing his first quest,  
> Though out of course, yet hath not bene mis-sayd,  
> To shew the courtesie by him profest,  
> Euen vnto the lowest and the least.  
> But now I come into my course againe,  
> To his atchieuement of the *Blatant beast*;  
> Who all this while at will did range and raine,  
> Whilst none was him to stop, nor none him to restraine.
>
> Sir *Calidore* when thus he now had raught  
> Faire *Pastorella* from those *Brigants* powre,  
> Vnto the Castle of *Belgard* her brought,  
> Whereof was Lord the good Sir *Bellamoure*;  
> Who whylome was in his youthes freshest flowre  
> A lustie knight, as euer wielded speare,  
> And had endured many a dreadfull stoure  
> In bloudy battell for a Ladie deare,  
> The fayrest Ladie then of all that liuing were.
>
> Her name was *Claribell*: whose father hight  
> The Lord of *Many Ilands*, farre renound  
> For his great riches and his greater might.  
> He through the wealth, wherein he did abound,  
> This daughter thought in wedlocke to haue bound  
> Vnto the Prince of *Picteland* bordering nere,  
> But she whose sides before with secret wound  
> Of loue to *Bellamoure* empierced were,  
> By all meanes shund to match with any forrein fere.
>
> And *Bellamour* againe so well her pleased,  
> With dayly seruice and attendance dew,  
> That of her loue he was entyrely seized,  
> And closely did her wed, but knowne to few.  
> Which when her father vnderstood, he grew  
> In so great rage, that them in dongeon deepe  
> Without compassion cruelly he threw;  
> Ye did so streightly them a sunder keepe,  
> That neither could to company of th'other creepe.
>
> Nathlesse Sir *Bellamour*, whether through grace  
> Or secret guifts so with his keepers wrought,  
> That to his loue sometimes he came in place,  
> Whereof her wombe vnwist to wight was fraught,  
> And in dew time a mayden child forth brought.  
> Which she streight way for dread least, if her syre  
> Should know thereof, to slay he would haue sought,  
> Deliuered to her handmayd, that for hyre  
> She should it cause be fostred vnder straunge attyre.
>
> The trustie damzell bearing it abrode  
> Into the emptie fields, where liuing wight  
> Mote not bewray the secret of her lode,  
> She forth gan lay vnto the open light  
> The litle babe, to take thereof a sight.  
> Whom whylest she did with watrie eyne behold,  
> Vpon the litle brest like christall bright,  
> She mote perceiue a litle purple mold,  
> That like a rose her silken leaues did faire vnfold.
>
> Well she it markt, and pittied the more,  
> Yet could not remedie her wretched case;  
> But closing it againe like as before,  
> Bedeaw'd with teares there left it in the place:  
> Yet left not quite, but drew a litle space  
> Behind the bushes, where she her did hyde,  
> To weet what mortall hand, or heauens grace  
> Would for the wretched infants helpe prouyde,  
> For which it loudly cald, and pittifully cryde.
>
> At length a Shepheard, which there by did keepe  
> His fleecie flocke vpon the playnes around,  
> Led with the infants cry, that loud did weepe,  
> Came to the place, where when he wrapped found  
> Th'abandond spoyle, he softly it vnbound;  
> And seeing there, that did him pittie sore,  
> He tooke it vp, and in his mantle wound;  
> So home vnto his honest wife it bore,  
> Who as her owne it nurst, and named euermore.
>
> Thus long continu'd *Claribell* a thrall,  
> And *Bellamour* in bands, till that her syre  
> Departed life, and left vnto them all.  
> Then all the stormes of fortunes former yre  
> Were turnd, and they to freedome did retyre.  
> Thenceforth they ioy'd in happinesse together,  
> And liued long in peace and loue entyre,  
> Without disquiet or dislike of ether,  
> Till time that *Calidore* brought *Pastorella* thether.
>
> Both whom they goodly well did entertaine;  
> For *Bellamour* knew *Calidore* right well,  
> And loued for his prowesse, sith they twaine  
> Long since had fought in field. Als *Claribell*  
> No lesse did tender the faire *Pastorell*,  
> Seeing her weake and wan, through durance long.  
> There they a while together thus did dwell  
> In much delight, and many ioyes among,  
> Vntill the damzell gan to wex more sound and strong.
>
> Tho gan Sir *Calidore* him to aduize  
> Of his first quest, which he had long forlore;  
> Asham'd to thinke, how he that enterprize,  
> The which the Faery Queene had long afore  
> Bequeath'd to him, forslacked had so sore;  
> That much he feared, least reprochfull blame  
> With foule dishonour him mote blot therefore;  
> Besides the losse of so much loos and fame,  
> As through the world thereby should glorifie his name.
>
> Therefore resoluing to returne in hast  
> Vnto so great atchieuement, he bethought  
> To leaue his Loue, now perill being past,  
> With *Claribell*, whylest he that monster sought  
> Throughout the world, and to destruction brought.  
> So taking leaue of his faire *Pastorell*,  
> Whom to recomfort, all the meanes he wrought,  
> With thanks to *Bellamour* and *Claribell*,  
> He went forth on his quest, and did, that him befell.
>
> But first, ere I doe his aduentures tell,  
> In this exploite, me needeth to declare,  
> What did betide to the faire *Pastorell*,  
> During his absence left in heauy care,  
> Through daily mourning, and nightly misfare:  
> Yet did that auncient matrone all she might,  
> To cherish her with all things choice and rare;  
> And her owne handmayd, that *Melissa* hight,  
> Appointed to attend her dewly day and night.
>
> Who in a morning, when this Mayden faire  
> Was dighting her, hauing her snowy brest  
> As yet not laced, nor her golden haire  
> Into their comely tresses dewly drest,  
> Chaunst to espy vpon her yuory chest  
> The rosie marke, which she remembred well  
> That litle Infant had, which forth she kest,  
> The daughter of her Lady *Claribell*,  
> The which she bore, the whiles in prison she did dwell.
>
> Which well auizing, streight she gan to cast  
> In her conceiptfull mynd, that this faire Mayd  
> Was that same infant, which so long sith past  
> She in the open fields had loosely layd  
> To Fortunes spoile, vnable it to ayd.  
> So full of ioy, streight forth she ran in hast  
> Vnto her mistresse, being halfe dismayd,  
> To tell her, how the heauens had her graste,  
> To saue her chylde, which in misfortunes mouth was plaste.
>
> The sober mother seeing such her mood,  
> Yet knowing not, what meant that sodaine thro,  
> Askt her, how mote her words be vnderstood,  
> And what the matter was, that mou'd her so.  
> My liefe (sayd she) ye know, that long ygo,  
> Whilest ye in durance dwelt, ye to me gaue  
> A little mayde, the which ye chylded tho;  
> The same againe if now ye list to haue,  
> The same is yonder Lady, whom high God did saue.
>
> Much was the Lady troubled at that speach,  
> And gan to question streight how she it knew.  
> Most certaine markes, (sayd she) do me it teach,  
> For on her brest I with these eyes did vew  
> The litle purple rose, which thereon grew,  
> Whereof her name ye then to her did giue.  
> Besides her countenaunce, and her likely hew,  
> Matched with equall yeares, do surely prieue  
> That yond same is your daughter sure, which yet doth liue.
>
> The matrone stayd no lenger to enquire,  
> But forth in hast ran to the straunger Mayd;  
> Whom catching greedily for great desire,  
> Rent vp her brest, and bosome open layd,  
> In which that rose she plainely saw displayd.  
> Then her embracing twixt her armes twaine,  
> She long so held, and softly weeping sayd;  
> And liuest thou my daughter now againe?  
> And art thou yet aliue, whom dead I long did faine.
>
> Tho further asking her of sundry things,  
> And times comparing with their accidents,  
> She found at last by very certaine signes,  
> And speaking markes of passed monuments,  
> That this young Mayd, whom chance to her presents  
> Is her owne daughter, her owne infant deare.  
> Tho wondring long at those so straunge euents,  
> A thousand times she her embraced nere,  
> With many a ioyfull kisse, and many a melting teare.
>
> Who euer is the mother of one chylde,  
> Which hauing thought long dead, she fyndes aliue,  
> Let her by proofe of that, which she hath fylde  
> In her owne breast, this mothers ioy descriue:  
> For other none such passion can contriue  
> In perfect forme, as this good Lady felt,  
> When she so faire a daughter saw suruiue,  
> As *Pastorella* was, that nigh she swelt  
> For passing ioy, which did all into pitty melt.
>
> Thence running forth vnto her loued Lord,  
> She vnto him recounted, all that fell:  
> Who ioyning ioy with her in one accord,  
> Acknowledg'd for his owne faire *Pastorell*.  
> There leaue we them in ioy, and let vs tell  
> Of *Calidore*; who seeking all this while  
> That monstrous Beast by finall force to quell,  
> Through euery place, with restlesse paine and toile  
> Him follow'd, by the tract of his outragious spoile.
>
> Through all estates he found that he had past,  
> In which he many massacres had left,  
> And to the Clergy now was come at last;  
> In which such spoile, such hauocke, and such theft  
> He wrought, that thence all goodnesse he bereft,  
> That endlesse were to tell. The Elfin Knight,  
> Who now no place besides vnsought had left,  
> At length into a Monastere did light,  
> Where he him foũd despoyling all with maine & might.
>
> Into their cloysters now he broken had,  
> Through which the Monckes he chaced here & there.  
> And them pursu'd into their dortours sad,  
> And searched all their cels and secrets neare;  
> In which what filth and ordure did appeare,  
> Were yrkesome to report; yet that foule Beast  
> Nought sparing them, the more did tosse and teare,  
> And ransacke all their dennes from most to least,  
> Regarding nought religion, nor their holy heast.
>
> From thence into the sacred Church he broke,  
> And robd the Chancell, and the deskes downe threw,  
> And Altars fouled, and blasphemy spoke,  
> And th'Images for all their goodly hew,  
> Did cast to ground, whilest none was them to rew;  
> So all confounded and disordered there.  
> But seeing *Calidore*, away he flew,  
> Knowing his fatall hand by former feare;  
> But he him fast pursuing, soone approched neare.
>
> Him in a narrow place he ouertooke,  
> And fierce assailing forst him turne againe:  
> Sternely he turnd againe, when he him strooke  
> With his sharpe steele, and ran at him amaine  
> With open mouth, that seemed to containe  
> A full good pecke within the vtmost brim,  
> All set with yron teeth in raunges twaine,  
> That terrifide his foes, and armed him,  
> Appearing like the mouth of *Orcus* griesly grim.
>
> And therein were a thousand tongs empight,  
> Of sundry kindes, and sundry quality;  
> Some were of dogs, that barked day and night,  
> And some of cats, that wrawling still did cry,  
> And some of Beares, that groynd continually,  
> And some of Tygres, that did seeme to gren,  
> And snar at all, that euer passed by:  
> But most of them were tongues of mortall men,  
> Which spake reprochfully, not caring where nor when.
>
> And them amongst were mingled here and there,  
> The tongues of Serpents with three forked stings,  
> That spat out poyson and gore bloudy gere  
> At all, that came within his rauenings,  
> And spake licentious words, and hatefull things  
> Of good and bad alike, of low and hie;  
> Ne Kesars spared he a whit, nor Kings,  
> But either blotted them with infamie,  
> Or bit them with his banefull teeth of iniury.
>
> But *Calidore* thereof no whit afrayd,  
> Rencountred him with so impetuous might,  
> That th'outrage of his violence he stayd,  
> And bet abacke, threatning in vaine to bite,  
> And spitting forth the poyson of his spight,  
> That fomed all about his bloody iawes.  
> Tho rearing vp his former feete on hight,  
> He rampt vpon him with his rauenous pawes,  
> As if he would haue rent him with his cruell clawes.
>
> But he right well aware, his rage to ward,  
> Did cast his shield atweene, and therewithall  
> Putting his puissaunce forth, pursu'd so hard,  
> That backeward he enforced him to fall:  
> And being downe, ere he new helpe could call,  
> His shield he on him threw, and fast downe held;  
> Like as a bullocke, that in bloudy stall  
> Of butchers balefull hand to ground is feld,  
> Is forcibly kept downe, till he be throughly queld.
>
> Full cruelly the Beast did rage and rore,  
> To be downe held, and maystred so with might,  
> That he gan fret and fome out bloudy gore,  
> Striuing in vaine to rere him selfe vpright.  
> For still the more he stroue, the more the Knight  
> Did him suppresse, and forcibly subdew;  
> That made him almost mad for fell despight.  
> He grind, hee bit, he scratcht, he venim threw,  
> And fared like a feend, right horrible in hew.
>
> Or like the hell-borne *Hydra*, which they faine  
> That great *Alcides* whilome ouerthrew,  
> After that he had labourd long in vaine,  
> To crop his thousand heads, the which still new  
> Forth budded, and in greater number grew.  
> Such was the fury of this hellish Beast,  
> Whilest *Calidore* him vnder him downe threw;  
> Who nathemore his heauy load releast,  
> But aye the more he rag'd, the more his powre increast.
>
> Tho when the Beast saw, he mote nought auaile,  
> By force, he gan his hundred tongues apply,  
> And sharpely at him to reuile and raile,  
> With bitter termes of shamefull infamy;  
> Oft interlacing many a forged lie,  
> Whose like he neuer once did speake, nor heare,  
> Nor euer thought thing so vnworthily:  
> Yet did he nought for all that him forbeare,  
> But strained him so streightly, that he chokt him neare.
>
> At last when as he found his force to shrincke,  
> And rage to quaile, he tooke a muzzell strong  
> Of surest yron, made with many a lincke;  
> Therewith he mured vp his mouth along,  
> And therein shut vp his blasphemous tong,  
> For neuer more defaming gentle Knight,  
> Or vnto louely Lady doing wrong:  
> And thereunto a great long chaine he tight,  
> With which he drew him forth, euen in his own despight.
>
> Like as whylome that strong *Tirynthian* swaine,  
> Brought forth with him the dreadfull dog of hell,  
> Against his will fast bound in yron chaine,  
> And roring horribly, did him compell  
> To see the hatefull sunne, that he might tell  
> To griesly *Pluto*, what on earth was donne,  
> And to the other damned ghosts, which dwell  
> For aye in darkenesse, which day light doth shonne:  
> So led this Knight his captyue with like conquest wonne.
>
> Yet greatly did the Beast repine at those  
> Straunge bands, whose like till then he neuer bore,  
> Ne euer any durst till then impose,  
> And chauffed inly, seeing now no more  
> Him liberty was left aloud to rore:  
> Yet durst he not draw backe; nor once withstand  
> The proued powre of noble *Calidore*,  
> But trembled vnderneath his mighty hand,  
> And like a fearefull dog him followed through the land.
>
> Him through all Faery land he follow'd so,  
> As if he learned had obedience long,  
> That all the people where so he did go,  
> Out of their townes did round about him throng,  
> To see him leade that Beast in bondage strong,  
> And seeing it, much wondred at the sight;  
> And all such persons, as he earst did wrong,  
> Reioyced much to see his captiue plight,  
> And much admyr'd the Beast, but more admyr'd the Knight.
>
> Thus was this Monster by the maystring might  
> Of doughty *Calidore*, supprest and tamed,  
> That neuer more he mote endammadge wight  
> With his vile tongue, which many had defamed,  
> And many causelesse caused to be blamed:  
> So did he eeke long after this remaine,  
> Vntill that, whether wicked fate so framed,  
> Or fault of men, he broke his yron chaine,  
> And got into the world at liberty againe.
>
> Thenceforth more mischiefe and more scath he wrought  
> To mortall men, then he had done before;  
> Ne euer could by any more be brought  
> Into like bands, ne maystred any more:  
> Albe that long time after *Calidore*,  
> The good Sir *Pelleas* him tooke in hand,  
> And after him Sir *Lamoracke* of yore,  
> And all his brethren borne in Britaine land;  
> Yet none of them could euer bring him into band.
>
> So now he raungeth through the world againe,  
> And rageth sore in each degree and state;  
> Ne any is, that may him now restraine,  
> He growen is so great and strong of late,  
> Barking and biting all that him doe bate,  
> Albe they worthy blame, or cleare of crime:  
> Ne spareth he most learned wits to rate,  
> Ne spareth he the gentle Poets rime,  
> But rends without regard of person or of time.
>
> Ne may this homely verse, of many meanest,  
> Hope to escape his venemous despite,  
> More then my former writs, all were they clearest  
> From blamefull blot, and free from all that wite,  
> With which some wicked tongues did it backebite,  
> And bring into a mighty Peres displeasure,  
> That neuer so deserued to endite.  
> Therfore do you my rimes keep better measure,  
> And seeke to please, that now is counted wisemens threasure.
