*Cant. II.*

> *Calidore sees young Tristram slay  
> A proud discourteous knight:  
> He makes him Squire, and of him learnes  
> his state and present plight.*

> VV Hat vertue is so fitting for a knight,  
> Or for a Ladie, whom a knight should loue,  
> As Curtesie, to beare themselues aright  
> To all of each degree, as doth behoue?  
> For whether they be placed high aboue,  
> Or low beneath, yet ought they well to know  
> Their good, that none them rightly may reproue  
> Of rudenesse, for not yeelding what they owe:  
> Great skill it is such duties timely to bestow.
>
> Thereto great helpe dame Nature selfe doth lend:  
> For some so goodly gratious are by kind,  
> That euery action doth them much commend,  
> And in the eyes of men great liking find;  
> Which others, that haue greater skill in mind,  
> Though they enforce themselues, cannot attaine.  
> For euerie thing, to which one is inclin'd,  
> Doth best become, and greatest grace doth gaine:  
> Yet praise likewise deserue good thewes, enforst with paine.
>
> That well in courteous *Calidore* appeares,  
> Whose euery act and word, that he did say,  
> Was like enchantment, that through both the eares,  
> And both the eyes did steale the hart away.  
> He now againe is on his former way,  
> To follow his first quest, when as he spyde  
> A tall young man from thence not farre away,  
> Fighting on foot, as well he him descryde,  
> Against an armed knight, that did on horsebacke ryde.
>
> And them beside a Ladie faire he saw,  
> Standing alone on foot, in foule array:  
> To whom himselfe he hastily did draw,  
> To weet the cause of so vncomely fray,  
> And to depart them, if so be he may.  
> But ere he came in place, that youth had kild  
> That armed knight, that low on ground he lay;  
> Which when he saw, his hart was inly child  
> With great amazement, & his thought with wonder fild.
>
> Him stedfastly he markt, and saw to bee  
> A goodly youth of amiable grace,  
> Yet but a slender slip, that scarse did see  
> Yet seuenteene yeares, but tall and faire of face  
> That sure he deem'd him borne of noble race.  
> All in a woodmans iacket he was clad  
> Of Lincolne greene, belayd with siluer lace;  
> And on his head an hood with aglets sprad,  
> And by his side his hunters horne he hanging had.
>
> Buskins he wore of costliest cordwayne,  
> Pinckt vpon gold, and paled part per part,  
> As then the guize was for each gentle swayne;  
> In his right hand he held a trembling dart,  
> Whose fellow he before had sent apart;  
> And in his left he held a sharpe borespeare,  
> With which he wont to launch the saluage hart  
> Of many a Lyon, and of many a Beare  
> That first vnto his hand in chase did happen neare.
>
> Whom *Calidore* a while well hauing vewed,  
> At length bespake; What meanes this, gentle swaine?  
> Why hath thy hand too bold it selfe embrewed  
> In blood of knight, the which by thee is slaine,  
> By thee no knight; which armes impugneth plaine?  
> Certes (said he) loth were I to haue broken  
> The law of armes; yet breake it should againe,  
> Rather then let my selfe of wight be stroken,  
> So long as these two armes were able to be wroken.
>
> For not I him, as this his Ladie here  
> May witnesse well, did offer first to wrong,  
> Ne surely thus vnarm'd I likely were;  
> But he me first, through pride and puissance strong  
> Assayld, not knowing what to armes doth long.  
> Perdie great blame, (then said Sir *Calidore*)  
> For armed knight a wight vnarm'd to wrong.  
> But then aread, thou gentle chyld, wherefore  
> Betwixt you two began this strife and sterne vprore.
>
> That shall I sooth (said he) to you declare.  
> I whose vnryper yeares are yet vnfit  
> For thing of weight, or worke of greater care,  
> Doe spend my dayes, and bend my carelesse wit  
> To saluage chace, where I thereon may hit  
> In all this forrest, and wyld wooddie raine:  
> Where, as this day I was enraunging it,  
> I chaunst to meete this knight, who there lyes slaine,  
> Together with this Ladie, passing on the plaine.
>
> The knight, as ye did see, on horsebacke was,  
> And this his Ladie, (that him ill became,)  
> On her faire feet by his horse side did pas  
> Through thicke and thin, vnfit for any Dame.  
> Yet not content, more to increase his shame,  
> When so she lagged, as she needs mote so,  
> He with his speare, that was to him great blame,  
> Would thumpe her forward, and inforce to goe,  
> Weeping to him in vaine, and making piteous woe.
>
> Which when I saw, as they me passed by,  
> Much was I moued in indignant mind,  
> And gan to blame him for such cruelty  
> Towards a Ladie, whom with vsage kind  
> He rather should haue taken vp behind.  
> Wherewith he wroth, and full of proud disdaine,  
> Tooke in foule scorne, that I such fault did find,  
> And me in lieu thereof reuil'd againe,  
> Threatning to chastize me, as doth t'a chyld pertaine.
>
> Which I no lesse disdayning, backe returned  
> His scornefull taunts vnto his teeth againe,  
> That he streight way with haughtie choler burned,  
> And with his speare strooke me one stroke or twaine;  
> Which I enforst to beare though to my paine,  
> Cast to requite, and with a slender dart,  
> Fellow of this I beare, throwne not in vaine,  
> Strooke him, as seemeth, vnderneath the hart,  
> That through the wound his spirit shortly did depart.
>
> Much did Sir *Calidore* admyre his speach  
> Tempred so well, but more admyr'd the stroke  
> That through the mayles had made so strong a breach  
> Into his hart, and had so sternely wroke  
> His wrath on him, that first occasion broke.  
> Yet rested not, but further gan inquire  
> Of that same Ladie, whether what he spoke,  
> Were soothly so, and that th'vnrighteous ire  
> Of her owne knight, had giuen him his owne due hire.
>
> Of all which, when as she could nought deny,  
> But cleard that stripling of th'imputed blame,  
> Sayd then Sir *Calidore*; Neither will I  
> Him charge with guilt, but rather doe quite clame:  
> For what he spake, for you he spake it, Dame;  
> And what he did, he did him selfe to saue:  
> Against both which that knight wrought knightlesse shame.  
> For knights and all men this by nature haue,  
> Towards all womenkind them kindly to behaue.
>
> But sith that he is gone irreuocable,  
> Please it you Ladie, to vs to aread,  
> What cause could make him so dishonourable,  
> To driue you so on foot vnfit to tread,  
> And lackey by him, gainst all womanhead?  
> Certes Sir knight (sayd she) full loth I were  
> To rayse a lyuing blame against the dead:  
> But since it me concernes, my selfe to clere,  
> I will the truth discouer, as it chaunst whylere.
>
> This day, as he and I together roade  
> Vpon our way, to which we weren bent,  
> We chaunst to come foreby a couert glade  
> Within a wood, whereas a Ladie gent  
> Sate with a knight in ioyous iolliment  
> Of their franke loues, free from all gealous spyes:  
> Faire was the Ladie sure, that mote content  
> An hart, not carried with too curious eyes,  
> And vnto him did shew all louely courtesyes.
>
> Whom when my knight did see so louely faire,  
> He inly gan her louer to enuy,  
> And wish, that he part of his spoyle might share.  
> Whereto when as my presence he did spy  
> To be a let, he bad me by and by  
> For to alight: but when as I was loth,  
> My loues owne part to leaue so suddenly,  
> He with strong hand down frõ his steed me throw'th,  
> And with presumpteous powre against that knight streight go'th.
>
> Vnarm'd all was the knight, as then more meete  
> For Ladies seruice, and for loues delight,  
> Then fearing any foeman there to meete:  
> Whereof he taking oddes, streight bids him dight  
> Himselfe to yeeld his loue, or else to fight.  
> Whereat the other starting vp dismayd,  
> Yet boldly answer'd, as he rightly might;  
> To leaue his loue he should be ill apayd,  
> In which he had good right gaynst all, that it gainesayd.
>
> Yet since he was not presently in plight  
> Her to defend, or his to iustifie,  
> He him requested, as he was a knight,  
> To lend him day his better right to trie,  
> Or stay till he his armes, which were thereby,  
> Might lightly fetch. But he was fierce and whot,  
> Ne time would giue, nor any termes aby,  
> But at him flew, and with his speare him smot;  
> From which to thinke to saue himselfe, it booted not.
>
> Meane while his Ladie, which this outrage saw,  
> Whilest they together for the quarrey stroue,  
> Into the couert did her selfe withdraw,  
> And closely hid her selfe within the groue.  
> My knight hers soone, as seemes, to daunger droue  
> And left sore wounded: but when her he mist,  
> He woxe halfe mad, and in that rage gan roue  
> And range through all the wood, where so he wist  
> She hidden was, and sought her so long, as him list.
>
> But when as her he by no meanes could find,  
> After long search and chauff, he turned backe  
> Vnto the place, where me he left behind:  
> There gan he me to curse and ban, for lacke  
> Of that faire bootie, and with bitter wracke  
> To wreake on me the guilt of his owne wrong.  
> Of all which I yet glad to beare the packe,  
> Stroue to appease him, and perswaded long:  
> But still his passion grew more violent and strong.
>
> Then as it were t'auenge his wrath on mee,  
> When forward we should fare, he flat refused  
> To take me vp (as this young man did see)  
> Vpon his steed, for no iust cause accused,  
> But forst to trot on foot, and foule misused,  
> Pounching me with the butt end of his speare,  
> In vaine complayning, to be so abused.  
> For he regarded neither playnt nor teare,  
> But more enforst my paine, the more my plaints to heare.
>
> So passed we, till this young man vs met,  
> And being moou'd with pittie of my plight,  
> Spake, as was meet, for ease of my regret:  
> Whereof befell, what now is in your sight.  
> Now sure (then said Sir *Calidore*) and right  
> Me seemes, that him befell by his owne fault:  
> Who euer thinkes through confidence of might,  
> Or through support of count'nance proud and hault  
> To wrong the weaker, oft falles in his owne assault.
>
> Then turning backe vnto that gentle boy,  
> Which had himselfe so stoutly well acquit;  
> Seeing his face so louely sterne and coy,  
> And hearing th'answeres of his pregnant wit,  
> He praysd it much, and much admyred it;  
> That sure he weend him borne of noble blood,  
> With whom those graces did so goodly fit:  
> And when he long had him beholding stood,  
> He burst into these words, as to him seemed good.
>
> Faire gentle swayne, and yet as stout as fayre,  
> That in these woods amongst the Nymphs dost wonne,  
> Which daily may to thy sweete lookes repayre,  
> As they are wont vnto *Latonaes* sonne,  
> After his chace on woodie *Cynthus* donne:  
> Well may I certes such an one thee read,  
> As by thy worth thou worthily hast wonne,  
> Or surely borne of some Heroicke sead,  
> That in thy face appeares and gratious goodlyhead.
>
> But should it not displease thee it to tell;  
> (Vnlesse thou in these woods thy selfe conceale,  
> For loue amongst the woodie Gods to dwell;)  
> I would thy selfe require thee to reueale,  
> For deare affection and vnfayned zeale,  
> Which to thy noble personage I beare,  
> And wish thee grow in worship and great weale.  
> For since the day that armes I first did reare,  
> I neuer saw in any greater hope appeare.
>
> To whom then thus the noble youth; May be  
> Sir knight, that by discouering my estate,  
> Harme may arise vnweeting vnto me;  
> Nathelesse, sith ye so courteous seemed late,  
> To you I will not feare it to relate.  
> Then wote ye that I am a Briton borne,  
> Sonne of a King, how euer thorough fate  
> Or fortune I my countrie haue forlorne,  
> And lost the crowne, which should my head by right adorne.
>
> And *Tristram* is my name, the onely heire  
> Of good king *Meliogras* which did rayne  
> In Cornewale, till that he through liues despeire  
> Vntimely dyde, before I did attaine  
> Ripe yeares of reason, my right to maintaine.  
> After whose death, his brother seeing mee  
> An infant, weake a kingdome to sustaine,  
> Vpon him tooke the roiall high degree,  
> And sent me, where him list, instructed for to bee.
>
> The widow Queene my mother, which then hight  
> Faire *Emiline*, conceiuing then great feare  
> Of my fraile safetie, resting in the might  
> Of him, that did the kingly Scepter beare,  
> Whose gealous dread induring not a peare,  
> Is wont to cut off all, that doubt may breed,  
> Thought best away me to remoue somewhere  
> Into some forrein land, where as no need  
> Of dreaded daunger might his doubtfull humour feed.
>
> So taking counsell of a wise man red,  
> She was by him aduiz'd, to send me quight  
> Out of the countrie wherein I was bred,  
> The which the fertile *Lionesse* is hight,  
> Into the land of *Faerie*, where no wight  
> Should weet of me, nor worke me any wrong.  
> To whose wise read she hearkning, sent me streight  
> Into this land, where I haue wond thus long,  
> Since I was ten yeares old, now growen to stature strong.
>
> All which my daies I haue not lewdly spent,  
> Nor spilt the blossome of my tender yeares  
> In ydlesse, but as was conuenient,  
> Haue trayned bene with many noble feres  
> In gentle thewes, and such like seemely leres.  
> Mongst which my most delight hath alwaies been,  
> To hunt the saluage chace amongst my peres,  
> Of all that raungeth in the forrest greene;  
> Of which none is to me vnknowne, that eu'r was seene.
>
> Ne is there hauke, which mantleth her on pearch,  
> Whether high towring, or accoasting low,  
> But I the measure of her flight doe search,  
> And all her pray, and all her diet know.  
> Such be our ioyes, which in these forrests grow:  
> Onely the vse of armes, which most I ioy,  
> And fitteth most for noble swayne to know,  
> I haue not tasted yet, yet past a boy,  
> And being now high time these strong ioynts to imploy.
>
> Therefore, good Sir, sith now occasion fit  
> Doth fall, whose like hereafter seldome may,  
> Let me this craue, vnworthy though of it,  
> That ye will make me Squire without delay,  
> That from henceforth in batteilous array  
> I may beare armes, and learne to vse them right;  
> The rather since that fortune hath this day  
> Giuen to me the spoile of this dead knight,  
> These goodly gilden armes, which I haue won in fight.
>
> All which when well Sir *Calidore* had heard,  
> Him much more now, then earst he gan admire,  
> For the rare hope which in his yeares appear'd,  
> And thus replide; Faire chyld, the high desire  
> To loue of armes, which in you doth aspire,  
> I may not certes without blame denie;  
> But rather wish, that some more noble hire,  
> (Though none more noble then is cheualrie,)  
> I had, you to reward with greater dignitie.
>
> There him he causd to kneele, and made to sweare  
> Faith to his knight, and truth to Ladies all,  
> And neuer to be recreant, for feare  
> Of perill, or of ought that might befall:  
> So he him dubbed, and his Squire did call.  
> Full glad and ioyous then young *Tristram* grew,  
> Like as a flowre, whose silken leaues small,  
> Long shut vp in the bud from heauens vew,  
> At length breakes forth, and brode displayes his smyling hew.
>
> Thus when they long had treated to and fro,  
> And *Calidore* betooke him to depart,  
> Chyld *Tristram* prayd, that he with him might goe  
> On his aduenture, vowing not to start,  
> But wayt on him in euery place and part.  
> Whereat Sir *Calidore* did much delight,  
> And greatly ioy'd at his so noble hart,  
> In hope he sure would proue a doughtie knight:  
> Yet for the time this answere he to him behight.
>
> Glad would I surely be, thou courteous Squire,  
> To haue thy presence in my present quest,  
> That mote thy kindled courage set on fire,  
> And flame forth honour in thy noble brest:  
> But I am bound by vow, which I profest  
> To my dread Soueraine, when I it assayd,  
> That in atchieuement of her high behest,  
> I should no creature ioyne vnto mine ayde,  
> For thy I may not graunt, that ye so greatly prayde.
>
> But since this Ladie is all desolate,  
> And needeth safegard now vpon her way,  
> Ye may doe well in this her needfull state  
> To succour her, from daunger of dismay;  
> That thankfull guerdon may to you repay.  
> The noble ympe of such new seruice fayne,  
> It gladly did accept, as he did say.  
> So taking courteous leaue, they parted twayne,  
> And *Calidore* forth passed to his former payne.
>
> But *Tristram* then despoyling that dead knight  
> Of all those goodly implements of prayse,  
> Long fed his greedie eyes with the faire sight  
> Of the bright mettall, shyning like Sunne rayes;  
> Handling and turning them a thousand wayes.  
> And after hauing them vpon him dight,  
> He tooke that Ladie, and her vp did rayse  
> Vpon the steed of her owne late dead knight:  
> So with her marched forth, as she did him behight.
>
> There to their fortune leaue we them awhile,  
> And turne we backe to good Sir *Calidore*;  
> Who ere he thence had traueild many a mile,  
> Came to the place, whereas ye heard afore  
> This knight, whom *Tristram* slew, had wounded sore  
> Another knight in his despiteous pryde;  
> There he that knight found lying on the flore,  
> With many wounds full perilous and wyde,  
> That all his garments, and the grasse in vermeill dyde.
>
> And there beside him sate vpon the ground  
> His wofull Ladie, piteously complayning  
> With loud laments that most vnluckie stound,  
> And her sad selfe with carefull hand constrayning  
> To wype his wounds, and ease their bitter payning.  
> Which sorie sight when *Calidore* did vew  
> With heauie eyne, from teares vneath refrayning,  
> His mightie hart their mournefull case can rew,  
> And for their better comfort to them nigher drew.
>
> Then speaking to the Ladie, thus he sayd:  
> Ye dolefull Dame, let not your griefe empeach  
> To tell, what cruell hand hath thus arayd  
> This knight vnarm'd, with so vnknightly breach  
> Of armes, that if I yet him nigh may reach,  
> I may auenge him of so foule despight.  
> The Ladie hearing his so courteous speach,  
> Gan reare her eyes as to the chearefull light,  
> And from her sory hart few heauie words forth sigh't.
>
> In which she shew'd, how that discourteous knight  
> (Whom *Tristram* slew) them in that shadow found,  
> Ioying together in vnblam'd delight,  
> And him vnarm'd, as now he lay on ground,  
> Charg'd with his speare and mortally did wound,  
> Withouten cause, but onely her to reaue  
> From him, to whom she was for euer bound:  
> Yet when she fled into that couert greaue,  
> He her not finding, both them thus nigh dead did leaue.
>
> When *Calidore* this ruefull storie had  
> Well vnderstood, he gan of her demand,  
> What manner wight he was, and how yclad,  
> Which had this outrage wrought with wicked hand.  
> She then, like as she best could vnderstand,  
> Him thus describ'd, to be of stature large,  
> Clad all in gilden armes, with azure band  
> Quartred athwart, and bearing in his targe  
> A Ladie on rough waues, row'd in a sommer barge.
>
> Then gan Sir *Calidore* to ghesse streightway  
> By many signes, which she described had,  
> That this was he, whom *Tristram* earst did slay,  
> And to her said; Dame be no longer sad:  
> For he, that hath your Knight so ill bestad,  
> Is now him selfe in much more wretched plight;  
> These eyes him saw vpon the cold earth sprad,  
> The meede of his desert for that despight,  
> Which to your selfe he wrought, & to your loued knight.
>
> Therefore faire Lady lay aside this griefe,  
> Which ye haue gathered to your gentle hart,  
> For that displeasure; and thinke what reliefe  
> Were best deuise for this your louers smart,  
> And how ye may him hence, and to what part  
> Conuay to be recur'd. She thankt him deare,  
> Both for that newes he did to her impart,  
> And for the courteous care, which he did beare  
> Both to her loue; and to her selfe in that sad dreare.
>
> Yet could she not deuise by any wit,  
> How thence she might conuay him to some place.  
> For him to trouble she it thought vnfit,  
> That was a straunger to her wretched case;  
> And him to beare, she thought it thing too base.  
> Which when as he perceiu'd, he thus bespake;  
> Faire Lady let it not you seeme disgrace,  
> To beare this burden on your dainty backe;  
> My selfe will beare a part, coportion of your packe.
>
> So off he did his shield, and downeward layd  
> Vpon the ground, like to an hollow beare;  
> And powring balme, which he had long puruayd,  
> Into his wounds, him vp thereon did reare,  
> And twixt them both with parted paines did beare,  
> Twixt life and death, not knowing what was donne.  
> Thence they him carried to a Castle neare,  
> In which a worthy auncient Knight did wonne:  
> Where what ensu'd, shall in next Canto be begonne.
