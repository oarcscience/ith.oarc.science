*Canto I.*

> *The Patron of true Holinesse,  
> Foule Errour doth defeate:  
> Hypocrisie him to entrappe,  
> Doth to his home entreate.*

> A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,  
>     Y cladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde,  
>     Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,  
>     The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde;  
>     Yet armes till that time did he neuer wield:  
>     His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,  
>     As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:  
>     Full iolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,  
> As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.
>
> But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,  
>     The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,  
>     For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,  
>     And dead as liuing euer him ador'd:  
>     Vpon his shield the like was also scor'd,  
>     For soueraine hope, which in his helpe he had:  
>     Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,  
>     But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;  
> Yet nothing did he dread, but euer was ydrad.
>
> Vpon a great aduenture he was bond,  
>     That greatest *Gloriana* to him gaue,  
>     That greatest Glorious Queene of *Faerie* lond,  
>     To winne him worship, and her grace to haue,  
>     Which of all earthly things he most did craue;  
>     And euer as he rode, his hart did earne  
>     To proue his puissance in battell braue  
>     Vpon his foe, and his new force to learne;  
> Vpon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.
>
> A louely Ladie rode him faire beside,  
>     Vpon a lowly Asse more white then snow,  
>     Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide  
>     Vnder a vele, that wimpled was full low,  
>     And ouer all a blacke stole she did throw,  
>     As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,  
>     And heauie sat vpon her palfrey slow:  
>     Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,  
> And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.
>
> So pure and innocent, as that same lambe,  
>     She was in life and euery vertuous lore,  
>     And by descent from Royall lynage came  
>     Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore  
>     Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,  
>     And all the world in their subiection held;  
>     Till that infernall feend with foule vprore  
>     Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:  
> Whom to auenge, she had this Knight from far cõpeld.
>
> Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,  
>     That lasie seemd in being euer last,  
>     Or wearied with bearing of her bag  
>     Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,  
>     The day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast,  
>     And angry *Ioue* an hideous storme of raine  
>     Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,  
>     That euery wight to shrowd it did constrain,  
> And this faire couple eke to shroud thẽselues were fain.
>
> Enforst to seeke some couert nigh at hand,  
>     A shadie groue not far away they spide,  
>     That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:  
>     Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,  
>     Did spred so broad, that heauens light did hide,  
>     Not perceable with power of any starre:  
>     And all within were pathes and alleies wide,  
>     With footing worne, and leading inward farre:  
> Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.
>
> And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,  
>     Ioying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,  
>     Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,  
>     Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.  
>     Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,  
>     The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,  
>     The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar neuer dry,  
>     The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,  
> The Aspine good for staues, the Cypresse funerall.
>
> The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours  
>     And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,  
>     The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,  
>     The Eugh obedient to the benders will,  
>     The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,  
>     The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,  
>     The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,  
>     The fruitfull Oliue, and the Platane round,  
> The caruer Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.
>
> Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,  
>     Vntill the blustring storme is ouerblowne;  
>     When weening to returne, whence they did stray,  
>     They cannot finde that path, which first was showne,  
>     But wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne,  
>     Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,  
>     That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:  
>     So many pathes, so many turnings seene,  
> That which of them to take, in diuerse doubt they been.
>
> At last resoluing forward still to fare,  
>     Till that some end they finde or in or out,  
>     That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,  
>     And like to lead the labyrinth about;  
>     Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,  
>     At length it brought them to a hollow caue,  
>     Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout  
>     Eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue,  
> And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gaue.
>
> Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,  
>     Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash prouoke:  
>     The danger hid, the place vnknowne and wilde,  
>     Breedes dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,  
>     And perill without show: therefore your stroke  
>     Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.  
>     Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to reuoke  
>     The forward footing for an hidden shade:  
> Vertue giues her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.
>
> Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place  
>     I better wot then you, though now too late  
>     To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,  
>     Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,  
>     To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.  
>     This is the wandring wood, this *Errours den*,  
>     A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:  
>     Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then  
> The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for liuing men.
>
> But full of fire and greedy hardiment,  
>     The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,  
>     But forth vnto the darksome hole he went,  
>     And looked in: his glistring armor made  
>     A litle glooming light, much like a shade,  
>     By which he saw the vgly monster plaine,  
>     Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,  
>     But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,  
> Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.
>
> And as she lay vpon the durtie ground,  
>     Her huge long taile her den all ouerspred,  
>     Yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound,  
>     Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred  
>     A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,  
>     Sucking vpon her poisonous dugs, each one  
>     Of sundry shapes, yet all ill fauored:  
>     Soone as that vncouth light vpon them shone,  
> Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.
>
> Their dam vpstart, out of her den effraide,  
>     And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile  
>     About her cursed head, whose folds displaid  
>     Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.  
>     She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle  
>     Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;  
>     For light she hated as the deadly bale,  
>     Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,  
> Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.
>
> Which when the valiant Elfe perceiu'd, he lept  
>     As Lyon fierce vpon the flying pray,  
>     And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept  
>     From turning backe, and forced her to stay:  
>     Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,  
>     And turning fierce, her speckled taile aduaunst,  
>     Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:  
>     Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:  
> The stroke down frõ her head vnto her shoulder glaunst.
>
> Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,  
>     Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,  
>     And all attonce her beastly body raizd  
>     With doubled forces high aboue the ground:  
>     Tho wrapping vp her wrethed sterne arownd,  
>     Lept fierce vpon his shield, and her huge traine  
>     All suddenly about his body wound,  
>     That hand or foot to stirre he stroue in vaine:  
> God helpe the man so wrapt in *Errours* endlesse traine.
>
> His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,  
>     Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,  
>     Add faith vnto your force, and be not faint:  
>     Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.  
>     That when he heard, in great perplexitie,  
>     His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,  
>     And knitting all his force got one hand free,  
>     Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,  
> That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.
>
> Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw  
>     A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,  
>     Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,  
>     Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke  
>     His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:  
>     Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,  
>     With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,  
>     And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:  
> Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.
>
> As when old father *Nilus* gins to swell  
>     With timely pride aboue the *Aegyptian* vale,  
>     His fattie waues do fertile slime outwell,  
>     And ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale:  
>     But when his later spring gins to auale,  
>     Huge heapes of mudd he leaues, wherein there breed  
>     Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male  
>     And partly female of his fruitfull seed;  
> Such vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed.
>
> The same so sore annoyed has the knight,  
>     That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,  
>     His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.  
>     Whose corage when the feend perceiu'd to shrinke,  
>     She poured forth out of her hellish sinke  
>     Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,  
>     Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,  
>     Which swarming all about his legs did crall,  
> And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.
>
> As gentle Shepheard in sweete euen-tide,  
>     When ruddy *Phoebus* gins to welke in west,  
>     High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,  
>     Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;  
>     A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,  
>     All striuing to infixe their feeble stings,  
>     That from their noyance he no where can rest,  
>     But with his clownish hands their tender wings  
> He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.
>
> Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,  
>     Then of the certaine perill he stood in,  
>     Halfe furious vnto his foe he came,  
>     Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,  
>     Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;  
>     And strooke at her with more then manly force,  
>     That from her body full of filthie sin  
>     He raft her hatefull head without remorse;  
> A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed frõ her corse.
>
> Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare  
>     They saw so rudely falling to the ground,  
>     Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,  
>     Gathred themselues about her body round,  
>     Weening their wonted entrance to haue found  
>     At her wide mouth: but being there withstood  
>     They flocked all about her bleeding wound,  
>     And sucked vp their dying mothers blood,  
> Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.
>
> That detestable sight him much amazde,  
>     To see th'vnkindly Impes of heauen accurst,  
>     Deuoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,  
>     Hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst,  
>     Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,  
>     And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end  
>     Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;  
>     Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,  
> His foes haue slaine themselues, with whom he should contend.
>
> His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre  
>     Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,  
>     And said, Faire knight, borne vnder happy starre,  
>     Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:  
>     Well worthy be you of that Armorie,  
>     Wherein ye haue great glory wonne this day,  
>     And proou'd your strength on a strong enimie,  
>     Your first aduenture: many such I pray,  
> And henceforth euer wish, that like succeed it may.
>
> Then mounted he vpon his Steede againe,  
>     And with the Lady backward sought to wend;  
>     That path he kept, which beaten was most plaine,  
>     Ne euer would to any by-way bend,  
>     But still did follow one vnto the end,  
>     The which at last out of the wood them brought.  
>     So forward on his way (with God to frend)  
>     He passed forth, and new aduenture sought;  
> Long way he trauelled, before he heard of ought.
>
> At length they chaunst to meet vpon the way  
>     An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,  
>     His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,  
>     And by his belt his booke he hanging had;  
>     Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,  
>     And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,  
>     Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,  
>     And all the way he prayed, as he went,  
> And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.
>
> He faire the knight saluted, louting low,  
>     Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:  
>     And after asked him, if he did know  
>     Of straunge aduentures, which abroad did pas.  
>     Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,  
>     Silly old man, that liues in hidden cell,  
>     Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,  
>     Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?  
> With holy father sits not with such things to mell.
>
> But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,  
>     And homebred euill ye desire to heare,  
>     Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,  
>     That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.  
>     Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,  
>     And shall you well reward to shew the place,  
>     In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:  
>     For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,  
> That such a cursed creature liues so long a space.
>
> Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse  
>     His dwelling is, by which no liuing wight  
>     May euer passe, but thorough great distresse.  
>     Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,  
>     And well I wote, that of your later fight  
>     Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,  
>     But wanting rest will also want of might?  
>     The Sunne that measures heauen all day long,  
> At night doth baite his steedes the *Ocean* waues emong.
>
> Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,  
>     And with new day new worke at once begin:  
>     Vntroubled night they say giues counsell best.  
>     Right well Sir knight ye haue aduised bin,  
>     (Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win  
>     Is wisely to aduise: now day is spent;  
>     Therefore with me ye may take vp your In  
>     For this same night. The knight was well content:  
> So with that godly father to his home they went.
>
> A little lowly Hermitage it was,  
>     Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,  
>     Far from resort of people, that did pas  
>     In trauell to and froe: a little wyde  
>     There was an holy Chappell edifyde,  
>     Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say  
>     His holy things each morne and euentyde:  
>     Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,  
> Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.
>
> Arriued there, the little house they fill,  
>     Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:  
>     Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;  
>     The noblest mind the best contentment has.  
>     With faire discourse the euening so they pas:  
>     For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,  
>     And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;  
>     He told of Saintes and Popes, and euermore  
> He strowd an *Aue-Mary* after and before.
>
> The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,  
>     And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,  
>     As messenger of *Morpheus* on them cast  
>     Sweet slõbring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.  
>     Vnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:  
>     Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,  
>     He to his study goes, and there amiddes  
>     His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,  
> He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes
>
> Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,  
>     (Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,  
>     With which and other spelles like terrible,  
>     He bad awake blacke *Plutoes* griesly Dame,  
>     And cursed heauen, and spake reprochfull shame  
>     Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;  
>     A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name  
>     Great *Gorgon*, Prince of darknesse and dead night,  
> At which *Cocytus* quakes, and *Styx* is put to flight.
>
> And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred

> He making speedy way through spersed ayre,

>     To *Morpheus* house doth hastily repaire.  
>     Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,  
>     And low, where dawning day doth neuer peepe,  
>     His dwelling is; there *Tethys* his wet bed  
>     Doth euer wash, and *Cynthia* still doth steepe  
>     In siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed,  
> Whiles sad Night ouer him her mãtle black doth spred
>
> Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,

> The messenger approching to him spake,

> The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,

> The God obayde, and calling forth straight way

> Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.
>
> All cleane dismayd to see so vncouth sight,  
>     And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,  
>     He thought haue slaine her in his fierce despight:  
>     But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,  
>     He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe aduise  
>     To proue his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.  
>     Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,  
>     Tho can she weepe, to stirre vp gentle ruth,  
> Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.
>
> And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my loue,  
>     Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,  
>     And mightie causes wrought in heauen aboue,  
>     Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,  
>     For hoped loue to winne me certaine hate?  
>     Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.  
>     Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state  
>     You, whom my hard auenging destinie  
> Hath made iudge of my life or death indifferently.
>
> Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leaue  
>     My Fathers kingdome,--There she stopt with teares;  
>     Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereaue,  
>     And then againe begun, My weaker yeares  
>     Captiu'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,  
>     Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:  
>     Let me not dye in languor and long teares.  
>     Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?  
> What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?
>
> Loue of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint  
>     Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night  
>     In secret anguish and vnpittied plaint,  
>     Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.  
>     Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight  
>     Suspect her truth: yet since no' vntruth he knew,  
>     Her fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight  
>     He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,  
> That for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew.
>
> Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;  
>     For all so deare as life is to my hart,  
>     I deeme your loue, and hold me to you bound;  
>     Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,  
>     Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.  
>     Not all content, yet seemd she to appease  
>     Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,  
>     And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,  
> So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.
>
> Long after lay he musing at her mood,  
>     Much grieu'd to thinke that gentle Dame so light,  
>     For whose defence he was to shed his blood.  
>     At last dull wearinesse of former fight  
>     Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,  
>     That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,  
>     With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:  
>     But when he saw his labour all was vaine,  
> With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.
