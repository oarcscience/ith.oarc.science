<blockquote>
<i>The battell twixt three brethren, with<br>
Cambell for Canacee.<br>
Cambina with true friendships bond<br>
doth their long strife agree.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
O
 Why doe wretched men so much desire,<br>
To draw their dayes vnto the vtmost date,<br>
And doe not rather wish them soone expire,<br>
Knowing the miserie of their estate,<br>
And thousand perills which them still awate,<br>
Tossing them like a boate amid the mayne,<br>
That euery houre they knocke at deathes gate?<br>
And he that happie seemes and least in payne,<br>
Yet is as nigh his end, as he that most doth playne.<p>

Therefore this Fay I hold but fond and vaine,<br>
The which in seeking for her children three<br>
Long life, thereby did more prolong their paine.<br>
Yet whilest they liued none did euer see<br>
More happie creatures, then they seem'd to bee,<br>
Nor more ennobled for their courtesie,<br>
That made them dearely lou'd of each degree;<br>
Ne more renowmed for their cheualrie,<br>
That made them dreaded much of all men farre and nie.<p>

These three that hardie chalenge tooke in hand,<br>
For <i>Canacee</i> with <i>Cambell</i> for to fight:<br>
The day was set, that all might vnderstand,<br>
And pledges pawnd the same to keepe a right,<br>
That day, the dreddest day that liuing wight<br>
Did euer see vpon this world to shine,<br>
So soone as heauens window shewed light,<br>
These warlike Champions all in armour shine,<br>
Assembled were in field, the chalenge to define.<p>

The field with listes was all about enclos'd,<br>
To barre the prease of people farre away;<br>
And at th'one side sixe iudges were dispos'd,<br>
To view and deeme the deedes of armes that day;<br>
And on the other side in fresh aray,<br>
Fayre <i>Canacee</i> vpon a stately stage<br>
Was set, to see the fortune of that fray,<br>
And to be seene, as his most worthie wage,<br>
That could her purchase with his liues aduentur'd gage.<p>

Then entred <i>Cambell</i> first into the list,<br>
With stately steps, and fearelesse countenance,<br>
As if the conquest his he surely wist.<br>
Soone after did the brethren three aduance,<br>
In braue aray and goodly amenance,<br>
With scutchins gilt and banners broad displayd:<br>
And marching thrise in warlike ordinance,<br>
Thrise lowted lowly to the noble Mayd,<br>
The whiles shril trompets &amp; loud clarions sweetly playd.<p>

Which doen the doughty chalenger came forth,<br>
All arm'd to point his chalenge to abet:<br>
Gainst whom Sir <i>Priamond</i> with equall worth:<br>
And equall armes himselfe did forward set.<br>
A trompet blew; they both together met,<br>
With dreadfull force, and furious intent,<br>
Carelesse of perill in their fiers affret,<br>
As if that life to losse they had forelent,<br>
And cared not to spare, that should be shortly spent.<p>

Right practicke was Sir <i>Priamond</i> in fight,<br>
And throughly skild in vse of shield and speare;<br>
Ne lesse approued was <i>Cambelloes</i> might,<br>
Ne lesse his skill in weapons did appeare,<br>
That hard it was to weene which harder were.<br>
Full many mightie strokes on either side<br>
Were sent, that seemed death in them to beare,<br>
But they were both so watchfull and well eyde,<br>
That they auoyded were, and vainely by did slyde.<p>

Yet one of many was so strongly bent<br>
By <i>Priamond</i>, that with vnluckie glaunce,<br>
Through <i>Cambels</i> shoulder it vnwarely went,<br>
That forced him his shield to disaduaunce:<br>
Much was he grieued with that gracelesse chaunce,<br>
Yet from the wound no drop of bloud there fell,<br>
But wondrous paine, that did the more enhaunce<br>
His haughtie courage to aduengement fell:<br>
Smart daunts not mighty harts, but makes them more to swell.<p>

With that his poynant speare he fierce auentred,<br>
With doubled force close vnderneath his shield,<br>
That through the mayles into his thigh it entred,<br>
And there arresting, readie way did yield,<br>
For bloud to gush forth on the grassie field;<br>
That he for paine himselfe n'ote right vpreare,<br>
But too and fro in great amazement reel'd,<br>
Like an old Oke whose pith and sap is seare,<br>
At puffe of euery storme doth stagger here and theare.<p>

Whom so dismayd when <i>Cambell</i> had espide,<br>
Againe he droue at him with double might,<br>
That nought mote stay the steele, till in his side<br>
The mortall point most cruelly empight:<br>
Where fast infixed, whilest he sought by slight<br>
It forth to wrest, the staffe a sunder brake,<br>
And left the head behind: with which despight<br>
He all enrag'd, his shiuering speare did shake,<br>
And charging him a fresh thus felly him bespake.<p>

Lo faitour there thy meede vnto thee take,<br>
The meede of thy mischalenge and abet:<br>
Not for thine owne, but for thy sisters sake,<br>
Haue I thus long thy life vnto thee let:<br>
But to forbeare doth not forgiue the det.<br>
The wicked weapon heard his wrathfull vow,<br>
And passing forth with furious affret,<br>
Pierst through his beuer quite into his brow,<br>
That with the force it backward forced him to bow.<p>

Therewith a sunder in the midst it brast,<br>
And in his hand nought but the troncheon left,<br>
The other halfe behind yet sticking fast,<br>
Out of his headpeece <i>Cambell</i> fiercely reft,<br>
And with such furie backe at him it heft,<br>
That making way vnto his dearest life,<br>
His weasand pipe it through his gorget cleft:<br>
Thence streames of purple bloud issuing rife,<br>
Let forth his wearie ghost and made an end of strife.<p>

His wearie ghost assoyld from fleshly band,<br>
Did not as others wont, directly fly<br>
Vnto her rest in Plutoes griesly land,<br>
Ne into ayre did vanish presently,<br>
Ne chaunged was into a starre in sky:<br>
But through traduction was eftsoones deriued,<br>
Like as his mother prayd the Destinie,<br>
Into his other brethren, that suruiued,<br>
In whom he liu'd a new, of former life depriued.<p>

Whom when on ground his brother next beheld,<br>
Though sad and sorie for so heauy sight,<br>
Yet leaue vnto his sorrow did not yeeld,<br>
But rather stird to vengeance and despight,<br>
Through secret feeling of his generous spright,<br>
Rusht fiercely forth, the battell to renew,<br>
As in reuersion of his brothers right;<br>
And chalenging the Virgin as his dew.<br>
His foe was soone addrest: the trompets freshly blew.<p>

With that they both together fiercely met,<br>
As if that each ment other to deuoure;<br>
And with their axes both so sorely bet,<br>
That neither plate nor mayle, whereas their powre<br>
They felt, could once sustaine the hideous stowre,<br>
But riued were like rotten wood a sunder,<br>
Whilest through their rifts the ruddie bloud did showre<br>
And fire did flash, like lightning after thunder,<br>
That fild the lookers on attonce with ruth and wonder.<p>

As when two Tygers prickt with hungers rage,<br>
Haue by good fortune found some beasts fresh spoyle,<br>
On which they weene their famine to asswage,<br>
And gaine a feastfull guerdon of their toyle,<br>
Both falling out doe stirre vp strifefull broyle,<br>
And cruell battell twixt themselues doe make,<br>
Whiles neither lets the other touch the soyle,<br>
But either sdeignes with other to partake:<br>
So cruelly these Knights stroue for that Ladies sake.<p>

Full many strokes, that mortally were ment,<br>
The whiles were enterchaunged twixt them two;<br>
Yet they were all with so good wariment<br>
Or warded, or auoyded and let goe,<br>
That still the life stood fearelesse of her foe:<br>
Till <i>Diamond</i> disdeigning long delay<br>
Of doubtfull fortune wauering to and fro,<br>
Resolu'd to end it one or other way;<br>
And heau'd his murdrous axe at him with mighty sway.<p>

The dreadfull stroke in case it had arriued,<br>
Where it was ment, (so deadly it was ment)<br>
The soule had sure out of his bodie riued,<br>
And stinted all the strife incontinent.<br>
But <i>Cambels</i> fate that fortune did preuent:<br>
For seeing it at hand, he swaru'd asyde,<br>
And so gaue way vnto his fell intent:<br>
Who missing of the marke which he had eyde,<br>
Was with the force nigh feld whilst his right foot did slyde.<p>

As when a Vulture greedie of his pray,<br>
Through hunger long, that hart to him doth lend,<br>
Strikes at an Heron with all his bodies sway,<br>
That from his force seemes nought may it defend;<br>
The warie fowle that spies him toward bend<br>
His dreadfull souse auoydes, it shunning light,<br>
And maketh him his wing in vaine to spend;<br>
That with the weight of his owne weeldlesse might,<br>
He falleth nigh to ground, and scarse recouereth flight.<p>

Which faire aduenture when <i>Cambello</i> spide,<br>
Full lightly, ere himselfe he could recower,<br>
From daungers dread to ward his naked side,<br>
He can let driue at him with all his power,<br>
And with his axe him smote in euill hower,<br>
That from his shoulders quite his head he reft:<br>
The headlesse tronke, as heedlesse of that stower,<br>
Stood still a while, and his fast footing kept,<br>
Till feeling life to fayle, it fell, and deadly slept.<p>

They which that piteous spectacle beheld,<br>
Were much amaz'd the headlesse tronke to see<br>
Stand vp so long, and weapon vaine to weld,<br>
Vnweeting of the Fates diuine decree,<br>
For lifes succession in those brethren three.<br>
For notwithstanding that one soule was reft,<br>
Yet, had the bodie not dismembred bee,<br>
It would haue liued, and reuiued eft;<br>
But finding no fit seat, the lifelesse corse it left.<p>

It left; but that same soule, which therein dwelt,<br>
Streight entring into <i>Triamond</i>, him fild<br>
With double life, and griefe, which when he felt,<br>
As one whose inner parts had bene ythrild<br>
With point of steele, that close his hartbloud spild,<br>
He lightly lept out of his place of rest,<br>
And rushing forth into the emptie field,<br>
Against <i>Cambello</i> fiercely him addrest;<br>
Who him affronting soone to fight was readie prest.<p>

Well mote ye wonder how that noble Knight,<br>
After he had so often wounded beene,<br>
Could stand on foot, now to renew the fight.<br>
But had ye then him forth aduauncing seene,<br>
Some newborne wight ye would him surely weene:<br>
So fresh he seemed and so fierce in sight;<br>
Like as a Snake, whom wearie winters teene,<br>
Hath worne to nought, now feeling sommers might,<br>
Casts off his ragged skin and freshly doth him dight.<p>

All was through vertue of the ring he wore,<br>
The which not onely did not from him let<br>
One drop of bloud to fall, but did restore<br>
His weakned powers, and dulled spirits whet,<br>
Through working of the stone therein yset.<br>
Else how could one of equall might with most,<br>
Against so many no lesse mightie met,<br>
Once thinke to match three such on equall cost,<br>
Three such as able were to match a puissant host.<p>

Yet nought thereof was <i>Triamond</i> adredde,<br>
Ne desperate of glorious victorie,<br>
But sharpely him assayld, and sore bestedde,<br>
With heapes of strokes, which he at him let flie,<br>
As thicke as hayle forth poured from the skie:<br>
He stroke, he soust, he foynd, he hewd, he lasht,<br>
And did his yron brond so fast applie,<br>
That from the same the fierie sparkles flasht,<br>
As fast as water-sprinckles gainst a rocke are dasht.<p>

Much was <i>Cambello</i> daunted with his blowes,<br>
So thicke they fell, and forcibly were sent,<br>
That he was forst from daunger of the throwes<br>
Backe to retire, and somewhat to relent,<br>
Till th'heat of his fierce furie he had spent:<br>
Which when for want of breath gan to abate,<br>
He then afresh with new encouragement<br>
Did him assayle, and mightily amate,<br>
As fast as forward erst, now backward to retrate.<p>

Like as the tide that comes fro th'Ocean mayne,<br>
Flowes vp the Shenan with contrarie forse,<br>
And ouerruling him in his owne rayne,<br>
Driues backe the current of his kindly course,<br>
And makes it seeme to haue some other sourse:<br>
But when the floud is spent, then backe againe<br>
His borrowed waters forst to redisbourse,<br>
He sends the sea his owne with double gaine,<br>
And tribute eke withall, as to his Soueraine.<p>

Thus did the battell varie to and fro,<br>
With diuerse fortune doubtfull to be deemed:<br>
Now this the better had, now had his fo;<br>
Then he halfe vanquisht, then the other seemed,<br>
Yet victors both them selues alwayes esteemed.<br>
And all the while the disentrayled blood<br>
Adowne their sides like litle riuers stremed,<br>
That with the wasting of his vitall flood,<br>
Sir <i>Triamond</i> at last full faint and feeble stood.<p>

But <i>Cambell</i> still more strong and greater grew,<br>
Ne felt his blood to wast, ne powres emperisht,<br>
Through that rings vertue, that with vigour new,<br>
Still when as he enfeebled was, him cherisht,<br>
And all his wounds, and all his bruses guarisht,<br>
Like as a withered tree through husbands toyle<br>
Is often seene full freshly to haue florisht,<br>
And fruitfull apples to haue borne awhile,<br>
As fresh as when it first was planted in the soyle.<p>

Through which aduantage, in his strength he rose,<br>
And smote the other with so wondrous might,<br>
That through the seame, which did his hauberk close,<br>
Into his throate and life it pierced quight,<br>
That downe he fell as dead in all mens sight:<br>
Yet dead he was not, yet he sure did die,<br>
As all men do, that lose the liuing spright:<br>
So did one soule out of his bodie flie<br>
Vnto her natiue home from mortall miserie.<p>

But nathelesse whilst all the lookers on<br>
Him dead behight, as he to all appeard,<br>
All vnawares he started vp anon,<br>
As one that had out of a dreame bene reard,<br>
And fresh assayld his foe; who halfe affeard<br>
Of th'vncouth sight, as he some ghost had seene,<br>
Stood still amaz'd, holding his idle sweard;<br>
Till hauing often by him stricken beene,<br>
He forced was to strike, and saue him selfe from teene.<p>

Yet from thenceforth more warily he fought,<br>
As one in feare the Stygian gods t'offend,<br>
Ne followd on so fast, but rather sought<br>
Him selfe to saue, and daunger to defend,<br>
Then life and labour both in vaine to spend.<br>
Which <i>Triamond</i> perceiuing, weened sure<br>
He gan to faint, toward the battels end,<br>
And that he should not long on foote endure,<br>
A signe which did to him the victorie assure.<p>

Whereof full blith, eftsoones his mightie hand<br>
He heav'd on high, in mind with that same blow<br>
To make an end of all that did withstand:<br>
Which <i>Cambell</i> seeing come, was nothing slow<br>
Him selfe to saue from that so deadly throw;<br>
And at that instant reaching forth his sweard<br>
Close vnderneath his shield, that scarce did show,<br>
Stroke him, as he his hand to strike vpreard,<br>
In th'arm-pit full, that through both sides the wound appeard.<p>

Yet still that direfull stroke kept on his way,<br>
And falling heauie on <i>Cambelloes</i> crest,<br>
Strooke him so hugely, that in swowne he lay,<br>
And in his head an hideous wound imprest:<br>
And sure had it not happily found rest<br>
Vpon the brim of his brode plated shield,<br>
It would haue cleft his braine downe to his brest.<br>
So both at once fell dead vpon the field,<br>
And each to other seemd the victorie to yield.<p>

Which when as all the lookers on beheld,<br>
They weened sure the warre was at an end,<br>
And Iudges rose, and Marshals of the field<br>
Broke vp the listes, their armes away to rend;<br>
And <i>Canacee</i> gan wayle her dearest frend.<br>
All suddenly they both vpstarted light,<br>
The one out of the swownd, which him did blend,<br>
The other breathing now another spright,<br>
And fiercely each assayling, gan afresh to fight.<p>

Long while they then continued in that wize,<br>
As if but then the battell had begonne:<br>
Strokes, wounds, wards, weapons, all they did despise,<br>
Ne either car'd to ward, or perill shonne,<br>
Desirous both to haue the battell donne;<br>
Ne either cared life to saue or spill,<br>
Ne which of them did winne, ne which were wonne.<br>
So wearie both of fighting had their fill,<br>
That life it selfe seemd loathsome, and long safetie ill.<p>

Whilst thus the case in doubtfull ballance hong,<br>
Vnsure to whether side it would incline,<br>
And all mens eyes and hearts, which there among<br>
Stood gazing, filled were with rufull tine,<br>
And secret feare, to see their fatall fine,<br>
All suddenly they heard a troublous noyes,<br>
That seemd some perilous tumult to desine,<br>
Confusd with womens cries, and shouts of boyes,<br>
Such as the troubled Theaters oftimes annoyes.<p>

Thereat the Champions both stood still a space,<br>
To weeten what that sudden clamour ment;<br>
Lo where they spyde with speedie whirling pace,<br>
One in a charet of straunge furniment,<br>
Towards them driuing like a storme out sent.<br>
The charet decked was in wondrous wize,<br>
With gold and many a gorgeous ornament,<br>
After the Persian Monarks antique guize,<br>
Such as the maker selfe could best by art deuize.<p>

And drawne it was (that wonder is to tell)<br>
Of two grim lyons, taken from the wood,<br>
In which their powre all others did excell;<br>
Now made forget their former cruell mood,<br>
T'obey their riders hest, as seemed good.<br>
And therein sate a Ladie passing faire<br>
And bright, that seemed borne of Angels brood,<br>
And with her beautie bountie did compare,<br>
Whether of them in her should haue the greater share.<p>

Thereto she learned was in Magicke leare,<br>
And all the artes, that subtill wits discouer,<br>
Hauing therein bene trained many a yeare,<br>
And well instructed by the Fay her mother,<br>
That in the same she farre exceld all other.<br>
Who vnderstanding by her mightie art,<br>
Of th'euill plight, in which her dearest brother<br>
Now stood, came forth in hast to take his part,<br>
And pacifie the strife, which causd so deadly smart.<p>

And as she passed through th'vnruly preace<br>
Of people, thronging thicke her to behold,<br>
Her angrie teame breaking their bonds of peace,<br>
Great heapes of them, like sheepe in narrow fold,<br>
For hast did ouer-runne, in dust enrould,<br>
That thorough rude confusion of the rout,<br>
Some fearing shriekt, some being harmed hould,<br>
Some laught for sport, some did for wonder shout,<br>
And some that would seeme wise, their wonder turnd to dout.<p>

In her right hand a rod of peace shee bore,<br>
About the which two Serpents weren wound,<br>
Entrayled mutually in louely lore,<br>
And by the tailes together firmely bound,<br>
And both were with one oliue garland crownd,<br>
Like to the rod which <i>Maias</i> sonne doth wield,<br>
Wherewith the hellish fiends he doth confound.<br>
And in her other hand a cup she hild,<br>
The which was with Nepenthe to the brim vpfild.<p>

Nepenthe is a drinck of souerayne grace,<br>
Deuized by the Gods, for to asswage<br>
Harts grief, and bitter gall away to chace,<br>
Which stirs vp anguish and contentious rage:<br>
In stead thereof sweet peace and quiet age<br>
It doth establish in the troubled mynd.<br>
Few men, but such as sober are and sage,<br>
Are by the Gods to drinck thereof assynd;<br>
But such as drinck, eternall happinesse do fynd.<p>

Such famous men, such worthies of the earth,<br>
As <i>Ioue</i> will haue aduaunced to the skie,<br>
And there made gods, though borne of mortall berth,<br>
For their high merits and great dignitie,<br>
Are wont, before they may to heauen flie,<br>
To drincke hereof, whereby all cares forepast<br>
Are washt away quite from their memorie.<br>
So did those olde Heroes hereof taste,<br>
Before that they in blisse amongst the Gods were plaste.<p>

Much more of price and of more gratious powre<br>
Is this, then that same water of Ardenne,<br>
The which <i>Rinaldo</i> drunck in happie howre,<br>
Described by that famous Tuscane penne:<br>
For that had might to change the hearts of men<br>
Fro loue to hate, a change of euill choise:<br>
But this doth hatred make in loue to brenne,<br>
And heauy heart with comfort doth reioyce.<br>
Who would not to this vertue rather yeeld his voice?<p>

At last arriuing by the listes side,<br>
Shee with her rod did softly smite the raile,<br>
Which straight flew ope, and gaue her way to ride.<br>
Eftsoones out of her Coch she gan auaile,<br>
And pacing fairely forth, did bid all haile,<br>
First to her brother, whom she loued deare,<br>
That so to see him made her heart to quaile:<br>
And next to <i>Cambell</i>, whose sad ruefull cheare<br>
Made her to change her hew, and hidden loue t'appeare.<p>

They lightly her requit (for small delight<br>
They had as then her long to entertaine.)<br>
And eft them turned both againe to fight;<br>
Which when she saw, downe on the bloudy plaine<br>
Her selfe she threw, and teares gan shed amaine;<br>
Amongst her teares immixing prayers meeke,<br>
And with her prayers reasons to restraine<br>
From blouddy strife, and blessed peace to seeke,<br>
By all that vnto them was deare, did them beseeke.<p>

But when as all might nought with them preuaile,<br>
Shee smote them lightly with her powrefull wand.<br>
Then suddenly as if their hearts did faile,<br>
Their wrathfull blades downe fell out of their hand,<br>
And they like men astonisht still did stand.<br>
Thus whilest their minds were doubtfully distraught,<br>
And mighty spirites bound with mightier band,<br>
Her golden cup to them for drinke she raught,<br>
Whereof full glad for thirst, ech drunk an harty draught.<p>

Of which so soone as they once tasted had,<br>
Wonder it is that sudden change to see:<br>
Instead of strokes, each other kissed glad,<br>
And louely haulst from feare of treason free,<br>
And plighted hands for euer friends to be.<br>
When all men saw this sudden change of things,<br>
So mortall foes so friendly to agree,<br>
For passing ioy, which so great maruaile brings,<br>
They all gan shout aloud, that all the heauen rings.<p>

All which, when gentle <i>Canacee</i> beheld,<br>
In hast she from her lofty chaire descended,<br>
To weet what sudden tidings was befeld:<br>
Where when she saw that cruell war so ended,<br>
And deadly foes so faithfully affrended,<br>
In louely wise she gan that Lady greet,<br>
Which had so great dismay so well amended,<br>
And entertaining her with curt'sies meet,<br>
Profest to her true friendship and affection sweet.<p>

Thus when they all accorded goodly were,<br>
The trumpets sounded, and they all arose,<br>
Thence to depart with glee and gladsome chere.<br>
Those warlike champions both together chose,<br>
Homeward to march, themselues there to repose,<br>
And wise <i>Cambina</i> taking by her side<br>
Faire <i>Canacee</i>, as fresh as morning rose,<br>
Vnto her Coch remounting, home did ride,<br>
Admir'd of all the people, and much glorifide.<p>

Where making ioyous feast theire daies they spent<br>
In perfect loue, deuoide of hatefull strife,<br>
Allide with bands of mutuall couplement;<br>
For <i>Triamond</i> had <i>Canacee</i> to wife,<br>
With whom he ledd a long and happie life;<br>
And <i>Cambel</i> tooke <i>Cambina</i> to his fere,<br>
The which as life were each to other liefe.<br>
So all alike did loue, and loued were,<br>
That since their days such louers were not found elswhere.<p>
