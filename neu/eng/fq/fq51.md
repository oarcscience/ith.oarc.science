*Cant. XII.*

> *Marin for loue of Florimell,  
> In languor wastes his life:  
> The Nymph his mother getteth her,  
> And giues to him for wife.*

> O What an endlesse worke haue I in hand,  
> To count the seas abundant progeny,  
> Whose fruitfull seede farre passeth those in land,  
> And also those which wonne in th'azure sky?  
> For much more eath to tell the starres on hy,  
> Albe they endlesse seeme in estimation,  
> Then to recount the Seas posterity:  
> So fertile be the flouds in generation,  
> So huge their numbers, and so numberlesse their nation.
>
> Therefore the antique wisards well inuented,  
> That *Venus* of the fomy sea was bred;  
> For that the seas by her are most augmented.  
> Witnesse th'exceeding fry, which there are fed,  
> And wondrous sholes, which may of none be red.  
> Then blame me not, if I haue err'd in count  
> Of Gods, of Nymphs, of riuers yet vnred:  
> For though their numbers do much more surmount,  
> Yet all those same were there, which erst I did recount.
>
> All those were there, and many other more,  
> Whose names and nations were too long to tell,  
> That *Proteus* house they fild euen to the dore;  
> Yet were they all in order, as befell,  
> According their degrees disposed well.  
> Amongst the rest, was faire *Cymodoce*,  
> The mother of vnlucky *Marinell*,  
> Who thither with her came, to learne and see  
> The manner of the Gods when they at banquet bee.
>
> But for he was halfe mortall, being bred  
> Of mortall sire, though of immortall wombe,  
> He might not with immortall food be fed,  
> Ne with th'eternall Gods to bancket come;  
> But walkt abrode, and round about did rome,  
> To view the building of that vncouth place,  
> That seem'd vnlike vnto his earthly home:  
> Where, as he to and fro by chaunce did trace,  
> There vnto him betid a disauentrous case.
>
> Vnder the hanging of an hideous clieffe,  
> He heard the lamentable voice of one,  
> That piteously complaind her carefull grieffe,  
> Which neuer she before disclosd to none,  
> But to her selfe her sorrow did bemone.  
> So feelingly her case she did complaine,  
> That ruth it moued in the rocky stone,  
> And made it seeme to feele her grieuous paine,  
> And oft to grone with billowes beating from the maine.
>
> Though vaine I see my sorrowes to vnfold,  
> And count my cares, when none is nigh to heare,  
> Yet hoping griefe may lessen being told,  
> I will them tell though vnto no man neare:  
> For heauen that vnto all lends equall eare,  
> Is farre from hearing of my heauy plight;  
> And lowest hell, to which I lie most neare,  
> Cares not what euils hap to wretched wight;  
> And greedy seas doe in the spoile of life delight.
>
> Yet loe the seas I see by often beating,  
> Doe pearce the rockes, and hardest marble weares;  
> But his hard rocky hart for no entreating  
> Will yeeld, but when my piteous plaints he heares,  
> Is hardned more with my aboundant teares.  
> Yet though he neuer list to me relent,  
> But let me waste in woe my wretched yeares,  
> Yet will I neuer of my loue repent,  
> But ioy that for his sake I suffer prisonment.
>
> And when my weary ghost with griefe outworne,  
> By timely death shall winne her wished rest,  
> Let then this plaint vnto his eares be borne,  
> That blame it is to him, that armes profest,  
> To let her die, whom he might haue redrest.  
> There did she pause, inforced to giue place,  
> Vnto the passion, that her heart opprest,  
> And after she had wept and wail'd a space,  
> She gan afresh thus to renew her wretched case.
>
> Ye Gods of seas, if any Gods at all  
> Haue care of right, or ruth of wretches wrong,  
> By one or other way me woefull thrall,  
> Deliuer hence out of this dungeon strong,  
> In which I daily dying am too long.  
> And if ye deeme me death for louing one,  
> That loues not me, then doe it not prolong,  
> But let me die and end my daies attone,  
> And let him liue vnlou'd, or loue him selfe alone.
>
> But if that life ye vnto me decree,  
> Then let mee liue, as louers ought to do,  
> And of my lifes deare loue beloued be:  
> And if he shall through pride your doome vndo,  
> Do you by duresse him compell thereto,  
> And in this prison put him here with me:  
> One prison fittest is to hold vs two:  
> So had I rather to be thrall, then free;  
> Such thraldome or such freedome let it surely be.
>
> But O vaine iudgement, and conditions vaine,  
> The which the prisoner points vnto the free,  
> The whiles I him condemne, and deeme his paine,  
> He where he list goes loose, and laughes at me.  
> So euer loose, so euer happy be.  
> But where so loose or happy that thou art,  
> Know *Marinell* that all this is for thee.  
> With that she wept and wail'd, as if her hart  
> Would quite haue burst through great abundance of her smart.
>
> All which complaint when *Marinell* had heard,  
> And vnderstood the cause of all her care  
> To come of him, for vsing her so hard,  
> His stubborne heart, that neuer felt misfare  
> Was toucht with soft remorse and pitty rare;  
> That euen for griefe of minde he oft did grone,  
> And inly wish, that in his powre it weare  
> Her to redresse: but since he meanes found none  
> He could no more but her great misery bemone.
>
> Thus whilst his stony heart with tender ruth  
> Was toucht, and mighty courage mollifide,  
> Dame *Venus* sonne that tameth stubborne youth  
> With iron bit, and maketh him abide,  
> Till like a victor on his backe he ride,  
> Into his mouth his maystring bridle threw,  
> That made him stoupe, till he did him bestride:  
> Then gan he make him tread his steps anew,  
> And learne to loue, by learning louers paines to rew.
>
> Now gan he in his grieued minde deuise,  
> How from that dungeon he might her enlarge:  
> Some while he thought, by faire and humble wise  
> To *Proteus* selfe to sue for her discharge:  
> But then he fear'd his mothers former charge  
> Gainst womens loue, long giuen him in vaine.  
> Then gan he thinke, perforce with sword and targe  
> Her forth to fetch, and *Proteus* to constraine:  
> But soone he gan such folly to forthinke againe.
>
> Then did he cast to steale her thence away,  
> And with him beare, where none of her might know.  
> But all in vaine: for why he found no way  
> To enter in, or issue forth below:  
> For all about that rocke the sea did flow.  
> And though vnto his will she giuen were,  
> Yet without ship or bote her thence to row,  
> He wist not how her thence away to bere;  
> And daunger well he wist long to continue there.
>
> At last when as no meanes he could inuent,  
> Backe to him selfe he gan returne the blame,  
> That was the author of her punishment;  
> And with vile curses, and reprochfull shame  
> To damne him selfe by euery euill name;  
> And deeme vnworthy or of loue or life,  
> That had despisde so chast and faire a dame,  
> Which him had sought through trouble & lõg strife;  
> Yet had refusde a God that her had sought to wife.
>
> In this sad plight he walked here and there,  
> And romed round about the rocke in vaine,  
> As he had lost him selfe, he wist not where;  
> Oft listening if he mote her heare againe;  
> And still bemoning her vnworthy paine.  
> Like as an Hynde whose calfe is falne vnwares  
> Into some pit, where she him heares complaine,  
> An hundred times about the pit side fares,  
> Right sorrowfully mourning her bereaued cares.
>
> And now by this the feast was throughly ended,  
> And euery one gan homeward to resort.  
> Which seeing *Marinell*, was sore offended,  
> That his departure thence should be so short,  
> And leaue his loue in that sea-walled fort.  
> Yet durst he not his mother disobay,  
> But her attending in full seemly sort,  
> Did march amongst the many all the way:  
> And all the way did inly mourne, like one astray.
>
> Being returned to his mothers bowre,  
> In solitary silence far from wight,  
> He gan record the lamentable stowre,  
> In which his wretched loue lay day and night,  
> For his deare sake, that ill deseru'd that plight:  
> The thought whereof empierst his hart so deepe,  
> That of no worldly thing he tooke delight;  
> Ne dayly food did take, ne nightly sleepe,  
> But pyn'd, &; mourn'd, & languisht, and alone did weepe.
>
> That in short space his wonted chearefull hew  
> Gan fade, and liuely spirits deaded quight:  
> His cheeke bones raw, and eie-pits hollow grew,  
> And brawney armes had lost their knowen might,  
> That nothing like himselfe he seem'd in sight.  
> Ere long so weake of limbe, and sicke of loue  
> He woxe, that lenger he note stand vpright,  
> But to his bed was brought, and layd aboue,  
> Like ruefull ghost, vnable once to stirre or moue.
>
> Which when his mother saw, she in her mind  
> Was troubled sore, ne wist well what to weene,  
> Ne could by search nor any meanes out find  
> The secret cause and nature of his teene,  
> Whereby she might apply some medicine;  
> But weeping day and night, did him attend,  
> And mourn'd to see her losse before her eyne,  
> Which grieu'd her more, that she it could not mend:  
> To see an helpelesse euill, double griefe doth lend.
>
> Nought could she read the roote of his disease,  
> Ne weene what mister maladie it is,  
> Whereby to seeke some meanes it to appease.  
> Most did she thinke, but most she thought amis,  
> That that same former fatall wound of his  
> Whyleare by *Tryphon* was not throughly healed,  
> But closely rankled vnder th'orifis:  
> Least did she thinke, that which he most concealed,  
> That loue it was, which in his hart lay vnreuealed.
>
> Therefore to *Tryphon* she againe doth hast,  
> And him doth chyde as false and fraudulent,  
> That fayld the trust, which she in him had plast,  
> To cure her sonne, as he his faith had lent:  
> Who now was falne into new languishment  
> Of his old hurt, which was not throughly cured.  
> So backe he came vnto her patient;  
> Where searching euery part, her well assured,  
> That it was no old sore, which his new paine procured.
>
> But that it was some other maladie,  
> Or griefe vnknowne, which he could not discerne:  
> So left he her withouten remedie.  
> Then gan her heart to faint, and quake, and earne,  
> And inly troubled was, the truth to learne.  
> Vnto himselfe she came, and him besought,  
> Now with faire speches, now with threatnings sterne,  
> If ought lay hidden in his grieued thought,  
> It to reueale: who still her answered, there was nought.
>
> Nathlesse she rested not so satisfide,  
> But leauing watry gods, as booting nought,  
> Vnto the shinie heauen in haste she hide,  
> And thence *Apollo* King of Leaches brought.  
> *Apollo* came; who soone as he had sought  
> Through his disease, did by and by out find,  
> That he did languish of some inward thought,  
> The which afflicted his engrieued mind;  
> Which loue he red to be, that leads each liuing kind.
>
> Which when he had vnto his mother told,  
> She gan thereat to fret, and greatly grieue.  
> And comming to her sonne, gan first to scold,  
> And chyde at him, that made her misbelieue:  
> But afterwards she gan him soft to shrieue,  
> And wooe with faire intreatie, to disclose,  
> Which of the Nymphes his heart so sore did mieue.  
> For sure she weend it was some one of those,  
> Which he had lately seene, that for his loue he chose.
>
> Now lesse she feared that same fatall read,  
> That warned him of womens loue beware:  
> Which being ment of mortall creatures sead,  
> For loue of Nymphes she thought she need not care,  
> But promist him, what euer wight she weare,  
> That she her loue to him would shortly gaine:  
> So he her told: but soone as she did heare  
> That *Florimell* it was, which wrought his paine,  
> She gan a fresh to chafe, and grieue in euery vaine.
>
> Yet since she saw the streight extremitie,  
> In which his life vnluckily was layd,  
> It was no time to scan the prophecie,  
> Whether old *Proteus* true or false had sayd,  
> That his decay should happen by a mayd.  
> It's late in death of daunger to aduize,  
> Or loue forbid him, that is life denayd:  
> But rather gan in troubled mind deuize,  
> How she that Ladies libertie might enterprize.
>
> To *Proteus* selfe to sew she thought it vaine,  
> Who was the root and worker of her woe:  
> Nor vnto any meaner to complaine,  
> But vnto great king *Neptune* selfe did goe,  
> And on her knee before him falling lowe,  
> Made humble suit vnto his Maiestie,  
> To graunt to her, her sonnes life, which his foe  
> A cruell Tyrant had presumpteouslie  
> By wicked doome condemn'd, a wretched death to die.
>
> To whom God *Neptune* softly smyling, thus;  
> Daughter me seemes of double wrong ye plaine,  
> Gainst one that hath both wronged you, and vs:  
> For death t'adward I ween'd did appertaine  
> To none, but to the seas sole Soueraine.  
> Read therefore who it is, which this hath wrought,  
> And for what cause; the truth discouer plaine.  
> For neuer wight so euill did or thought,  
> But would some rightfull cause pretend, though rightly nought.
>
> To whom she answerd, Then it is by name  
> *Proteus*, that hath ordayn'd my sonne to die;  
> For that a waift, the which by fortune came  
> Vpon your seas, he claym'd as propertie:  
> And yet nor his, nor his in equitie,  
> But yours the waift by high prerogatiue.  
> Therefore I humbly craue your Maiestie,  
> It to repleuie, and my sonne repriue:  
> So shall you by one gift saue all vs three aliue.
>
> He graunted it: and streight his warrant made,  
> Vnder the Sea-gods seale autenticall,  
> Commaunding *Proteus* straight t'enlarge the mayd,  
> Which wandring on his seas imperiall,  
> He lately tooke, and sithence kept as thrall.  
> Which she receiuing with meete thankefulnesse,  
> Departed straight to *Proteus* therewithall:  
> Who reading it with inward loathfulnesse,  
> Was grieued to restore the pledge, he did possesse.
>
> Yet durst he not the warrant to withstand,  
> But vnto her deliuered *Florimell*.  
> Whom she receiuing by the lilly hand,  
> Admyr'd her beautie much, as she mote well:  
> For she all liuing creatures did excell;  
> And was right ioyous, that she gotten had  
> So faire a wife for her sonne *Marinell*.  
> So home with her she streight the virgin lad,  
> And shewed her to him, then being sore bestad.
>
> Who soone as he beheld that angels face,  
> Adorn'd with all diuine perfection,  
> His cleared heart eftsoones away gan chace  
> Sad death, reuiued with her sweet inspection  
> And feeble spirit inly felt refection;  
> As withered weed through cruell winters tine,  
> That feeles the warmth of sunny beames reflection,  
> Liftes vp his head, that did before decline  
> And gins to spread his leafe before the faire sunshine.
>
> Right so himselfe did *Marinell* vpreare,  
> When he in place his dearest loue did spy;  
> And though his limbs could not his bodie beare,  
> Ne former strength returne so suddenly,  
> Yet chearefull signes he shewed outwardly.  
> Ne lesse was she in secret hart affected,  
> But that she masked it with modestie,  
> For feare she should of lightnesse be detected:  
> Which to another place I leaue to be perfected.
