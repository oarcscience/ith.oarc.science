*Cant. XI.*

> *Marinells former wound is heald,  
> he comes to Proteus hall,  
> Where Thames doth the Medway wedd,  
> and feasts the Sea-gods all.*

> B Vt ah for pittie that I haue thus long  
> Left a fayre Ladie languishing in payne:  
> Now well away, that I haue doen such wrong,  
> To let faire *Florimell* in bands remayne,  
> In bands of loue, and in sad thraldomes chayne;  
> From which vnlesse some heauenly powre her free  
> By miracle, not yet appearing playne,  
> She lenger yet is like captiu'd to bee:  
> That euen to thinke thereof, it inly pitties mee.
>
> Here neede you to remember, how erewhile  
> Vnlouely *Proteus*, missing to his mind  
> That Virgins loue to win by wit or wile,  
> Her threw into a dongeon deepe and blind,  
> And there in chaynes her cruelly did bind,  
> In hope thereby her to his bent to draw:  
> For when as neither gifts nor graces kind  
> Her constant mind could moue at all he saw,  
> He thought her to compell by crueltie and awe.
>
> Deepe in the bottome of an huge great rocke  
> The dongeon was, in which her bound he left,  
> That neither yron barres, nor brasen locke  
> Did neede to gard from force, or secret theft  
> Of all her louers, which would her haue reft.  
> For wall'd it was with waues, which rag'd and ror'd  
> As they the cliffe in peeces would haue cleft;  
> Besides ten thousand monsters foule abhor'd  
> Did waite about it, gaping griesly all begor'd.
>
> And in the midst thereof did horror dwell,  
> And darkenesse dredd, that neuer viewed day,  
> Like to the balefull house of lowest hell,  
> In which old *Styx* her aged bones alway,  
> Old *Styx* the Grandame of the Gods, doth lay.  
> There did this lucklesse mayd seuen months abide,  
> Ne euer euening saw, ne mornings ray,  
> Ne euer from the day the night descride,  
> But thought it all one night, that did no houres diuide.
>
> And all this was for loue of *Marinell*,  
> Who her despysd (ah who would her despyse?)  
> And wemens loue did from his hart expell,  
> And all those ioyes that weake mankind entyse.  
> Nathlesse his pride full dearely he did pryse;  
> For of a womans hand it was ywroke,  
> That of the wound he yet in languor lyes,  
> Ne can be cured of that cruell stroke  
> Which *Britomart* him gaue, when he did her prouoke.
>
> Yet farre and neare the Nymph his mother sought,  
> And many salues did to his sore applie,  
> And many herbes did vse. But when as nought  
> She saw could ease his rankling maladie,  
> At last to *Tryphon* she for helpe did hie,  
> (This *Tryphon* is the seagods surgeon hight)  
> Whom she besought to find some remedie:  
> And for his paines a whistle him behight  
> That of a fishes shell was wrought with rare delight.
>
> So well that Leach did hearke to her request,  
> And did so well employ his carefull paine,  
> That in short space his hurts he had redrest,  
> And him restor'd to healthfull state againe:  
> In which he long time after did remaine  
> There with the Nymph his mother, like her thrall;  
> Who sore against his will did him retaine,  
> For feare of perill, which to him mote fall,  
> Through his too ventrous prowesse proued ouer all.
>
> It fortun'd then, a solemne feast was there  
> To all the Sea-gods and their fruitfull seede,  
> In honour of the spousalls, which then were  
> Betwixt the *Medway* and the *Thames* agreed.  
> Long had the *Thames* (as we in records reed)  
> Before that day her wooed to his bed;  
> But the proud Nymph would for no worldly meed,  
> Nor no entreatie to his loue be led;  
> Till now at last relenting, she to him was wed.
>
> So both agreed, that this their bridale feast  
> Should for the Gods in *Proteus* house be made;  
> To which they all repayr'd, both most and least,  
> Aswell which in the mightie Ocean trade,  
> As that in riuers swim, or brookes doe wade.  
> All which not if an hundred tongues to tell,  
> And hundred mouthes, and voice of brasse I had,  
> And endlesse memorie, that mote excell,  
> In order as they came, could I recount them well.
>
> Helpe therefore, O thou sacred imp of *Ioue*,  
> The noursling of Dame *Memorie* his deare,  
> To whom those rolles, layd vp in heauen aboue,  
> And records of antiquitie appeare,  
> To which no wit of man may comen neare;  
> Helpe me to tell the names of all those floods,  
> And all those Nymphes, which then assembled were  
> To that great banquet of the watry Gods,  
> And all their sundry kinds, and all their hid abodes.
>
> First came great *Neptune* with his threeforkt mace,  
> That rules the Seas, and makes them rise or fall;  
> His dewy lockes did drop with brine apace,  
> Vnder his Diademe imperiall:  
> And by his side his Queene with coronall,  
> Faire *Amphitrite*, most diuinely faire,  
> Whose yuorie shoulders weren couered all,  
> As with a robe, with her owne siluer haire,  
> And deckt with pearles, which th'Indian seas for her prepaire.
>
> These marched farre afore the other crew;  
> And all the way before them as they went,  
> *Triton* his trompet shrill before them blew,  
> For goodly triumph and great iollyment,  
> That made the rockes to roare, as they were rent.  
> And after them the royall issue came,  
> Which of them sprung by lineall descent:  
> First the Sea-gods, which to themselues doe clame  
> The powre to rule the billowes, and the waues to tame.
>
> *Phorcys*, the father of that fatall brood,  
> By whom those old Heroes wonne such fame;  
> And *Glaucus*, that wise southsayes vnderstood;  
> And tragicke *Inoes* sonne, the which became  
> A God of seas through his mad mothers blame,  
> Now hight *Palemon*, and is saylers frend;  
> Great *Brontes*, and *Astraeus*, that did shame  
> Himselfe with incest of his kin vnkend;  
> And huge *Orion*, that doth tempests still portend.
>
> The rich *Cteatus*, and *Eurytus* long;  
> *Neleus* and *Pelias* louely brethren both;  
> Mightie *Chrysaor*, and *Caicus* strong;  
> *Eurypulus*, that calmes the waters wroth;  
> And faire *Euphaemus*, that vpon them go'th  
> As on the ground, without dismay or dread:  
> Fierce *Eryx*, and *Alebius* that know'th  
> The waters depth, and doth their bottome tread;  
> And sad *Asopus*, comely with his hoarie head.
>
> There also some most famous founders were  
> Of puissant Nations, which the world possest;  
> Yet sonnes of *Neptune*, now assembled here:  
> Ancient *Ogyges*, even th'auncientest,  
> And *Inachus* renowmd aboue the rest;  
> *Phoenix*, and *Aon*, and *Pelasgus* old,  
> Great *Belus*, *Phoeax*, and *Agenor* best;  
> And mightie *Albion*, father of the bold  
> And warlike people, which the *Britaine* Islands hold.
>
> For *Albion* the sonne of *Neptune* was,  
> Who for the proofe of his great puissance,  
> Out of his *Albion* did on dry-foot pas  
> Into old *Gall*, that now is cleeped *France*,  
> To fight with *Hercules*, that did aduance  
> To vanquish all the world with matchlesse might,  
> And there his mortall part by great mischance  
> Was slaine: but that which is th'immortall spright  
> Liues still: and to this feast with *Neptunes* seed was dight.
>
> But what doe I their names seeke to reherse,  
> Which all the world haue with their issue fild?  
> How can they all in this so narrow verse  
> Contayned be, and in small compasse hild?  
> Let them record them, that are better skild,  
> And know the moniments of passed times:  
> Onely what needeth, shall be here fulfild,  
> T'expresse some part of that great equipage,  
> Which from great *Neptune* do deriue their parentage.
>
> Next came the aged *Ocean*, and his Dame,  
> Old *Tethys*, th'oldest two of all the rest,  
> For all the rest of those two parents came,  
> Which afterward both sea and land possest:  
> Of all which *Nereus* th'eldest, and the best,  
> Did first proceed, then which none more vpright,  
> Ne more sincere in word and deed profest;  
> Most voide of guile, most free from fowle despight,  
> Doing him selfe, and teaching others to doe right.
>
> Thereto he was expert in prophecies,  
> And could the ledden of the Gods vnfold,  
> Through which, when *Paris* brought his famous prise  
> The faire Tindarid lasse, he him fortold,  
> That her all *Greece* with many a champion bold  
> Should fetch againe, and finally destroy  
> Proud *Priams* towne. So wise is *Nereus* old,  
> And so well skild; nathlesse he takes great ioy  
> Oft-times amõgst the wanton Nymphs to sport and toy.
>
> And after him the famous riuers came,  
> Which doe the earth enrich and beautifie:  
> The fertile Nile, which creatures new doth frame;  
> Long Rhodanus, whose sourse springs from the skie;  
> Faire Ister, flowing from the mountaines hie;  
> Diuine Scamander, purpled yet with blood  
> Of Greekes and Troians, which therein did die;  
> Pactolus glistring with his golden flood,  
> And Tygris fierce, whose streames of none may be withstood.
>
> Great Ganges, and immortall Euphrates,  
> Deepe Indus, and Maeander intricate,  
> Slow Peneus, and tempestuous Phasides,  
> Swift Rhene, and Alpheus still immaculate:  
> Ooraxes, feared for great *Cyrus* fate;  
> Tybris, renowmed for the Romaines fame,  
> Rich Oranochy, though but knowen late;  
> And that huge Riuer, which doth beare his name  
> Of warlike Amazons, which doe possesse the same.
>
> Ioy on those warlike women, which so long  
> Can from all men so rich a kingdome hold;  
> And shame on you, ô men, which boast your strong  
> And valiant hearts, in thoughts lesse hard and bold,  
> Yet quaile in conquest of that land of gold.  
> But this to you, ô Britons, most pertaines,  
> To whom the right hereof it selfe hath sold;  
> The which for sparing litle cost or paines,  
> Loose so immortall glory, and so endlesse gaines.
>
> Then was there heard a most celestiall sound,  
> Of dainty musicke, which did next ensew  
> Before the spouse: that was *Arion* crownd;  
> Who playing on his harpe, vnto him drew  
> The eares and hearts of all that goodly crew,  
> That euen yet the Dolphin, which him bore  
> Through the AEgaean seas from Pirates vew,  
> Stood still by him astonisht at his lore,  
> And all the raging seas for ioy forgot to rore.
>
> So went he playing on the watery plaine.  
> Soone after whom the louely Bridegroome came,  
> The noble Thamis, with all his goodly traine,  
> But him before there went, as best became  
> His auncient parents, namely th'auncient Thame.  
> But much more aged was his wife then he,  
> The Ouze, whom men doe Isis rightly name;  
> Full weake and crooked creature seemed she,  
> And almost blind through eld, that scarce her way could see.
>
> Therefore on either side she was sustained  
> Of two smal grooms, which by their names were hight  
> The *Churne*, and *Charwell*, two small streames, which pained  
> Them selues her footing to direct aright,  
> Which fayled oft through faint and feeble plight:  
> But *Thame* was stronger, and of better stay;  
> Yet seem'd full aged by his outward sight,  
> With head all hoary, and his beard all gray,  
> Deawed with siluer drops, that trickled downe alway.
>
> And eke he somewhat seem'd to stoupe afore  
> With bowed backe, by reason of the lode,  
> And auncient heauy burden, which he bore  
> Of that faire City, wherein make abode  
> So many learned impes, that shoote abrode,  
> And with their braunches spred all Britany,  
> No lesse then do her elder sisters broode.  
> Ioy to you both, ye double noursery  
> Or Arts, but Oxford thine doth *Thame* most glorify.
>
> But he their sonne full fresh and iolly was,  
> All decked in a robe of watchet hew,  
> On which the waues, glittering like Christall glas,  
> So cunningly enwouen were, that few  
> Could weenen, whether they were false or trew.  
> And on his head like to a Coronet  
> He wore, that seemed strange to common vew,  
> In which were many towres and castels set,  
> That it encompast round as with a golden fret.
>
> Like as the mother of the Gods, they say,  
> In her great iron charet wonts to ride,  
> When to *Ioues* pallace she doth take her way;  
> Old *Cybele*, arayd with pompous pride,  
> Wearing a Diademe embattild wide  
> With hundred turrets, like a Turribant.  
> With such an one was Thamis beautifide;  
> That was to weet the famous Troynouant,  
> In which her kingdomes throne is chiefly resiant.
>
> And round about him many a pretty Page  
> Attended duely, ready to obay;  
> All little Riuers, which owe vassallage  
> To him, as to their Lord, and tribute pay:  
> The chaulky Kenet, and the Thetis gray,  
> The morish Cole, and the soft sliding Breane,  
> The wanton Lee, that oft doth loose his way,  
> And the still Darent, in whose waters cleane  
> Ten thousand fishes play, and decke his pleasant streame.
>
> Then came his neighbour flouds, which nigh him dwell,  
> And water all the English soile throughout;  
> They all on him this day attended well;  
> And with meet seruice waited him about;  
> Ne none disdained low to him to lout:  
> No not the stately Seuerne grudg'd at all,  
> Ne storming Humber, though he looked stout;  
> But both him honor'd as their principall,  
> And let their swelling waters low before him fall.
>
> There was the speedy Tamar, which deuides  
> The Cornish and the Deuonish confines;  
> Through both whose borders swiftly downe it glides,  
> And meeting Plim, to Plimmouth thence declines:  
> And Dart, nigh chockt with sands of tinny mines.  
> But Auon marched in more stately path,  
> Proud of his Adamants, with which he shines  
> And glisters wide, as als' of wondrous Bath,  
> And Bristow faire, which on his waues he builded hath.
>
> And there came Stoure with terrible aspect,  
> Bearing his sixe deformed heads on hye,  
> That doth his course through Blandford plains direct,  
> And washeth Winborne meades in season drye.  
> Next him went Wylibourne with passage slye,  
> That of his wylinesse his name doth take,  
> And of him selfe doth name the shire thereby;  
> And Mole, that like a nousling Mole doth make  
> His way still vnder ground, till Thamis he ouertake.
>
> Then came the Rother, decked all with woods  
> Like a wood God, and flowing fast to Rhy:  
> And Sture, that parteth with his pleasant floods  
> The Easterne Saxons from the Southerne ny,  
> And Clare, and Harwitch both doth beautify:  
> Him follow'd Yar, soft washing Norwitch wall,  
> And with him brought a present ioyfully  
> Of his owne fish vnto their festiuall,  
> Whose like none else could shew, the which they Ruffins call.
>
> Next these the plenteous Ouse came far from land,  
> By many a city, and by many a towne,  
> And many riuers taking vnder hand  
> Into his waters, as he passeth downe,  
> The Cle, the Were, the Grant, the Sture, the Rowne.  
> Thence doth by Huntingdon and Cambridge flit;  
> My mother Cambridge, whom as with a Crowne  
> He doth adorne, and is adorn'd of it  
> With many a gentle Muse, and many a learned wit.
>
> And after him the fatall Welland went,  
> That if old sawes proue true (which God forbid)  
> Shall drowne all Holland with his excrement,  
> And shall see Stamford, though now homely hid,  
> Then shine in learning, more then euer did  
> Cambridge or Oxford, Englands goodly beames.  
> And next to him the *Nene* downe softly slid;  
> And bounteous Trent, that in him selfe enseames  
> Both thirty sorts of fish, and thirty sundry streames.
>
> Next these came Tyne, along whose stony bancke  
> That Romaine Monarch built a brasen wall,  
> Which mote the feebled Britons strongly flancke  
> Against the Picts, that swarmed ouer all,  
> Which yet thereof Gualseuer they doe call:  
> And Twede the limit betwixt Logris land  
> And Albany: And Eden though but small,  
> Yet often stainde with bloud of many a band  
> Of Scots and English both, that tyned on his strand.
>
> Then came those sixe sad brethren, like forlorne,  
> That whilome were (as antique fathers tell)  
> Sixe valiant Knights, of one faire Nymphe yborne,  
> Which did in noble deedes of armes excell,  
> And wonned there, where now Yorke people dwell;  
> Still Vre, swift Werfe, and Oze the most of might,  
> High Swale, vnquiet Nide, and troublous Skell;  
> All whom a Scythian king, that Humber hight,  
> Slew cruelly, and in the riuer drowned quight.
>
> But past not long, ere *Brutus* warlicke sonne  
> *Locrinus* them aueng'd, and the same date,  
> Which the proud Humber vnto them had donne,  
> By equall dome repayd on his owne pate:  
> For in the selfe same riuer, where he late  
> Had drenched them, he drowned him againe;  
> And nam'd the riuer of his wretched fate;  
> Whose bad condition yet it doth retaine,  
> Oft tossed with his stormes, which therein still remaine.
>
> These after, came the stony shallow Lone,  
> That to old Loncaster his name doth lend;  
> And following Dee, which Britons long ygone  
> Did call diuine, that doth by Chester tend;  
> And Conway which out of his streame doth send  
> Plenty of pearles to decke his dames withall,  
> And Lindus that his pikes doth most commend,  
> Of which the auncient Lincolne men doe call;  
> All these together marched toward *Proteus* hall.
>
> Ne thence the Irishe Riuers absent were:  
> Sith no lesse famous then the rest they bee,  
> And ioyne in neighbourhood of kingdome nere,  
> Why should they not likewise in loue agree,  
> And ioy likewise this solemne day to see?  
> They saw it all, and present were in place;  
> Though I them all according their degree,  
> Cannot recount, nor tell their hidden race,  
> Nor read the saluage c&utilds;treis, thorough which they pace.
>
> There was the Liffy rolling downe the lea,  
> The sandy Slane, the stony Aubrian,  
> The spacious Shenan spreading like a sea,  
> The pleasant Boyne, the fishy fruitfull Ban,  
> Swift Awniduff, which of the English man  
> Is cal'de Blacke water, and the Liffar deep,  
> Sad Trowis, that once his people ouerran,  
> Strong Allo tombling from Slewlogher steep,  
> And Mulla mine, whose waues I whilom taught to weep.
>
> And there the three renowmed brethren were,  
> Which that great Gyant *Blomius* begot,  
> Of the faire Nimph *Rheusa* wandring there.  
> One day, as she to shunne the season whot,  
> Vnder Slewbloome in shady groue was got,  
> This Gyant found her, and by force deflowr'd:  
> Whereof conceiuing, she in time forth brought  
> These three faire sons, which being thẽce forth powrd  
> In three great riuers ran, and many countreis scowrd.
>
> The first, the gentle Shure that making way  
> By sweet Clonmell, adornes rich Waterford;  
> The next, the stubborne Newre, whose waters gray  
> By faire Kilkenny and Rosseponte boord,  
> The third, the goodly Barow, which doth hoord  
> Great heapes of Salmons in his deepe bosome:  
> All which long sundred, doe at last accord  
> To ioyne in one, ere to the sea they come,  
> So flowing all from one, all one at last become.
>
> There also was the wide embayed Mayre,  
> The pleasaunt Bandon crownd with many a wood,  
> The spreading Lee, that like an Island fayre  
> Encloseth Corke with his deuided flood;  
> And balefull Oure, late staind with English blood:  
> With many more, whose names no tongue can tell.  
> All which that day in order seemly good  
> Did on the Thamis attend, and waited well  
> To doe their duefull seruice, as to them befell.
>
> Then came the Bride, the louely *Medua* came,  
> Clad in a vesture of vnknowen geare,  
> And vncouth fashion, yet her well became;  
> That seem'd like siluer, sprinckled here and theare

> Her goodly lockes adowne her backe did flow
