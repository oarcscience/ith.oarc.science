*The VIII. Canto, vnperfite.*

> W Hen I bethinke me on that speech whyleare,  
> Of *Mutability*, and well it way:  
> Me seemes, that though she all vnworthy were  
> Of the Heav'ns Rule ; yet very sooth to say,  
> In all things else she beares the greatest sway.  
> Which makes me loath this state of life so tickle,  
> And loue of things so vaine to cast away;  
> Whose flowring pride, so fading and so fickle,  
> Short *Time* shall soon cut down with his consuming sickle.
>
> Then gin I thinke on that which Nature sayd,  
> Of that same time when no more *Change* shall be,  
> But stedfast rest of all things firmely stayd  
> Vpon the pillours of Eternity,  
> That is contrayr to *Mutabilitie:*  
> For, all that moueth, doth in *Change* delight:  
> But thence-forth all shall rest eternally  
> With Him that is the God of Sabbaoth hight:  
> O thou great Sabbaoth God, graunt me that Sabaoths sight.

*FINIS*
