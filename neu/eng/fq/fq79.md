*Cant. VI.*

> *Proud* Change *(not pleasd, in mortall things,  
> beneath the Moone, to raigne)  
> Pretends, as well of Gods, as Men,  
> to be the Soueraine.*

> W Hat man that sees the euer-whirling wheele  
> Of *Change*, the which all mortall things doth sway,  
> But that therby doth find, & plainly feele,  
> How *MVTABILITY* in them doth play  
> Her cruell sports, to many mens decay?  
> Which that to all may better yet appeare,  
> I will rehearse that whylome I heard say,  
> How she at first her selfe began to reare,  
> Gainst all the Gods, and th'empire sought from them to beare.
>
> But first, here falleth fittest to vnfold  
> Her antique race and linage ancient,  
> As I haue found it registred of old,  
> In *Faery* Land mongst records permanent:  
> She was, to weet, a daughter by descent  
> Of those old *Titans*, that did whylome striue  
> VVith *Saturnes* sonne for heauens regiment.  
> Whom, though high *Ioue* of kingdome did depriue,  
> Yet many of their stemme long after did surviue.
>
> And many of them, afterwards obtain'd  
> Great power of *Ioue*, and high authority;  
> As *Hecaté*, in whose almighty hand,  
> He plac't all rule and principality,  
> To be by her disposed diuersly,  
> To Gods, and men, as she them list diuide:  
> And drad *Bellona*, that doth sound on hie  
> Warres and allarums vnto Nations wide,  
> That makes both heauen & earth to tremble at her pride.
>
> So likewise did this *Titanesse* aspire,  
> Rule and dominion to her selfe to gaine;  
> That as a Goddesse, men might her admire,  
> And heauenly honours yield, as to them twaine.  
> At first, on earth she sought it to obtaine;  
> Where she such proofe and sad examples shewed  
> Of her great power, to many ones great paine,  
> That not men onely (whom she soone subdewed)  
> But eke all other creatures, her bad dooings rewed.
>
> For, she the face of earthly things so changed,  
> That all which Nature had establisht first  
> In good estate, and in meet order ranged,  
> She did pervert, and all their statutes burst:  
> And all the worlds faire frame (which none yet durst  
> Of Gods or men to alter or misguide)  
> She alter'd quite, and made them all accurst  
> That God had blest; and did at first prouide  
> In that still happy state for euer to abide.
>
> Ne shee the lawes of Nature onely brake,  
> But eke of Iustice, and of Policie;  
> And wrong of right, and bad of good did make,  
> And death for life exchanged foolishlie:  
> Since which, all liuing wights haue learn'd to die,  
> And all this world is woxen daily worse.  
> Of pittious worke of *MVTABILITIE*!  
> By which, we all are subiect to that curse,  
> And death in stead of life haue sucked from our Nurse.
>
> And now, when all the earth she thus had brought  
> To her behest, and thralled to her might,  
> She gan to cast in her ambitious thought,  
> T'attempt the empire of the heauens hight,  
> And *Ioue* himselfe to shoulder from his right.  
> And first, she past the region of the ayre,  
> And of the fire, whose substance thin and slight,  
> Made no resistance, ne could her contraire,  
> But ready passage to her pleasure did prepaire.
>
> Thence, to the Circle of the Moone she clambe,  
> Where *Cynthia* raignes in euerlasting glory,  
> To whose bright shining palace straight she came,  
> All fairely deckt with heauens goodly story:  
> Whose siluer gates (by which there sate an hory  
> Old aged Sire, with hower-glasse in hand,  
> Hight *Tyme*) she entred, were he liefe or sory:  
> Ne staide till she the highest stage had scand,  
> VVhere *Cynthia* did sit, that neuer still did stand.
>
> Her sitting on an Iuory throne shee found,  
> Drawne of two steeds, th'one black, the other white,  
> Environd with tenne thousand starres around,  
> That duly her attended day and night;  
> And by her side, there ran her Page, that hight  
> *Vesper*, whom we the Euening-starre intend:  
> That with his Torche, still twinkling like twylight,  
> Her lightened all the way where she should wend,  
> And ioy to weary wandring trauailers did lend:
>
> That when the hardy *Titanesse* beheld  
> The goodly building of her Palace bright,  
> Made of the heauens substance, and vp-held  
> With thousand Crystall pillors of huge hight,  
> Shee gan to burne in her ambitious spright,  
> And t'envie her that in such glorie raigned.  
> Eftsoones she cast by force and tortious might,  
> Her to displace; and to her selfe to haue gained  
> The kingdome of the Night, and waters by her wained.
>
> Boldly she bid the Goddesse downe descend,  
> And let her selfe into that Ivory throne;  
> For, shee her selfe more worthy thereof wend,  
> And better able it to guide alone:  
> Whether to men, whose fall she did bemone,  
> Or vnto Gods, whose state she did maligne,  
> Or to th'infernall Powers, her need giue lone  
> Of her faire light, and bounty most benigne,  
> Her selfe of all that rule shee deemed most condigne.
>
> But shee that had to her that soueraigne seat  
> By highest *Ioue* assign'd, therein to beare  
> Nights burning lamp, regarded not her threat,  
> Ne yielded ought for fauour or for feare;  
> But with sterne countenaunce and disdainfull cheare,  
> Bending her horned browes, did put her back:  
> And boldly blaming her for comming there,  
> Bade her attonce from heauens coast to pack,  
> Or at her perill bide the wrathfull Thunders wrack.
>
> Yet nathemore the *Giantesse* forbare:  
> But boldly preacing-on, raught forth her hand  
> To pluck her downe perforce from off her chaire;  
> And there-with lifting vp her golden wand,  
> Threatned to strike her if she did with-stand.  
> Whereat the starres, which round about her blazed,  
> And eke the Moones bright wagon, still did stand,  
> All beeing with so bold attempt amazed,  
> And on her vncouth habit and sterne looke still gazed.
>
> Meane-while, the lower World, which nothing knew  
> Of all that chaunced here, was darkned quite;  
> And eke the heauens, and all the heauenly crew  
> Of happy wights, now vnpurvaide of light,  
> Were much afraid, and wondred at that sight;  
> Fearing least *Chaos* broken had his chaine,  
> And brought againe on them eternall night:  
> But chiefely *Mercury*, that next doth raigne,  
> Ran forth in haste, vnto the king of Gods to plaine.
>
> All ran together with a great out-cry,  
> To *Ioues* faire Palace, fixt in heauens hight;  
> And beating at his gates full earnestly,  
> Gan call to him aloud with all their might,  
> To know what meant that suddaine lack of light.  
> The father of the Gods when this he heard,  
> Was troubled much at their so strange affright,  
> Doubting least *Typhon* were againe vprear'd,  
> Or other his old foes, that once him sorely fear'd.
>
> Eftsoones the sonne of *Maia* forth he sent  
> Downe to the Circle of the Moone, to knowe  
> The cause of this so strange astonishment,  
> And why shee did her wonted course forslowe;  
> And if that any were on earth belowe  
> That did with charmes or Magick her molest,  
> Him to attache, and downe to hell to throwe:  
> But, if from heauen it were, then to arrest  
> The Author, and him bring before his presence prest.
>
> The wingd-foot God, so fast his plumes did beat,  
> That soone he came where-as the *Titanesse*  
> Was striuing with faire *Cynthia* for her seat:  
> At whose strange sight, and haughty hardinesse,  
> He wondred much, and feared her no lesse.  
> Yet laying feare aside to doe his charge,  
> At last, he bade her (with bold stedfastnesse)  
> Ceasse to molest the Moone to walke at large,  
> Or come before high *Ioue*, her dooings to discharge.
>
> And there-with-all, he on her shoulder laid  
> His snaky-wreathed Mace, whose awfull power  
> Doth make both Gods and hellish fiends affraid:  
> Where-at the *Titanesse* did sternely lower,  
> And stoutly answer'd, that in euill hower  
> He from his *Ioue* such message to her brought,  
> To bid her leaue faire *Cynthias* siluer bower;  
> Sith shee his *Ioue* and him esteemed nought,  
> No more then *Cynthia's* selfe; but all their kingdoms sought.
>
> The Heauens Herald staid not to reply,  
> But past away, his doings to relate  
> Vnto his Lord; who now in th'highest sky,  
> VVas placed in his principall Estate,  
> VVith all the Gods about him congregate:  
> To whom when *Hermes* had his message told,  
> It did them all exceedingly amate,  
> Saue *Ioue*; who, changing nought his count'nance bold,  
> Did vnto them at length these speeches wise vnfold;
>
> Harken to mee awhile yee heauenly Powers;  
> Ye may remember since th'Earths cursed seed  
> Sought to assaile the heauens eternall towers,  
> And to vs all exceeding feare did breed:  
> But how we then defeated all their deed,  
> Yee all doe knowe, and them destroied quite;  
> Yet not so quite, but that there did succeed  
> An off-spring of their bloud, which did alite  
> Vpon the fruitfull earth, which doth vs yet despite.
>
> Of that bad seed is this bold woman bred,  
> That now with bold presumption doth aspire  
> To thrust faire *Phoebe* from her siluer bed,  
> And eke our selues from heauens high Empire,  
> If that her might were match to her desire:  
> Wherefore, it now behoues vs to advise  
> What way is best to driue her to retire;  
> Whether by open force, or counsell wise,  
> Areed ye sonnes of God, as best ye can deuise.
>
> So hauing said, he ceast; and with his brow  
> (His black eye-brow, whose doomefull dreaded beck  
> Is wont to wield the world vnto his vow,  
> And euen the highest Powers of heauen to check)  
> Made signe to them in their degrees to speake:  
> Who straight gan cast their counsell graue and wise.  
> Meane-while, th'Earths daughter, thogh she nought did reck  
> Of *Hermes* message; yet gan now advise,  
> What course were best to take in this hot bold emprize.
>
> Eftsoones she thus resolv'd; that whil'st the Gods  
> (After returne of *Hermes* Embassie)  
> Were troubled, and amongst themselues at ods,  
> Before they could new counsels re-allie,  
> To set vpon them in that extasie;  
> And take what fortune time and place would lend:  
> So, forth she rose, and through the purest sky  
> To *Ioues* high Palace straight cast to ascend,  
> To prosecute her plot: Good on-set boads good end.
>
> Shee there arriuing, boldly in did pass;  
> Where all the Gods she found in counsell close,  
> All quite vnarm'd, as then their manner was.  
> At sight of her they suddaine all arose,  
> In great amaze, ne wist what way to chose.  
> But *Ioue*, all fearelesse, forc't them to aby;  
> And in his soueraine throne, gan straight dispose  
> Himselfe more full of grace and Maiestie,  
> That mote encheare his friends, & foes mote terrifie.
>
> That, when the haughty *Titanesse* beheld,  
> All were she fraught with pride and impudence,  
> Yet with the sight thereof was almost queld;  
> And inly quaking, seem'd as reft of sense,  
> And voyd of speech in that drad audience;  
> Vntill that *Ioue* himselfe, her selfe bespake:  
> Speake thou fraile woman, speake with confidence,  
> Whence art thou, and what doost thou here now make?  
> What idle errand hast thou, earths mansion to forsake?
>
> Shee, halfe confused with his great commaund,  
> Yet gathering spirit of her natures pride,  
> Him boldly answer'd thus to his demaund:  
> I am a daughter, by the mothers side,  
> Of her that is Grand-mother magnifide  
> Of all the Gods, great *Earth*, great *Chaos* child:  
> But by the fathers (be it not envide)  
> I greater am in bloud (whereon I build)  
> Then all the Gods, though wrongfully from heauen exil'd.
>
> For, *Titan* (as ye all acknowledge must)  
> Was *Saturnes* elder brother by birth-right;  
> Both, sonnes of *Vranus:* but by vniust  
> And guilefull meanes, through *Corybantes* slight,  
> The younger thrust the elder from his right:  
> Since which, thou *Ioue*, iniuriously hast held  
> The Heauens rule from *Titans* sonnes by might;  
> And them to hellish dungeons downe hast feld:  
> Witnesse ye Heauens the truth of all that I haue teld.
>
> Whil'st she thus spake, the Gods that gaue good eare  
> To her bold words, and marked well her grace,  
> Beeing of stature tall as any there  
> Of all the Gods, and beautifull of face,  
> As any of the Goddesses in place,  
> Stood all astonied, like a sort of Steeres;  
> Mongst whom, some beast of strange & forraine race,  
> Vnwares is chaunc't, far straying from his peeres:  
> So did their ghastly gaze bewray their hidden feares.
>
> Till hauing pauz'd awhile, *Ioue* thus bespake;  
> VVill neuer mortall thoughts ceasse to aspire,  
> In this bold sort, to Heauen claime to make,  
> And touch celestiall seates with earthly mire?  
> I would haue thought, that bold *Procrustes* hire,  
> Or *Typhons* fall, or proud *Ixions* paine,  
> Or great *Prometheus*, tasting of our ire,  
> Would haue suffiz'd, the rest for to restraine;  
> And warn'd all men by their example to refraine:
>
> But now, this off-scum of that cursed fry,  
> Dare to renew the like bold enterprize,  
> And chalenge th'heritage of this our skie;  
> Whom what should hinder, but that we likewise  
> Should handle as the rest of her allies,  
> And thunder-driue to hell? With that, he shooke  
> His Nectar-deawed locks, with which the skyes  
> And all the world beneath for terror quooke,  
> And eft his burning levin-brond in hand he tooke.
>
> But, when he looked on her louely face,  
> In which, faire beames of beauty did appeare,  
> That could the greatest wrath soone turne to grace  
> (Such sway doth beauty euen in Heauen beare)  
> He staide his hand: and hauing chang'd his cheare,  
> He thus againe in milder wise began;  
> But ah! if Gods should striue with flesh yfere,  
> Then shortly should the progeny of Man  
> Be rooted out, if *Ioue* should doe still what he can:
>
> But thee faire *Titans* child, I rather weene,  
> Through some vaine errour or inducement light,  
> To see that mortall eyes haue neuer seene;  
> Or through ensample of thy sisters might,  
> *Bellona*; whose great glory thou doost spight,  
> Since thou hast seene her dreadfull power belowe,  
> Mongst wretched men (dismaide with her affright)  
> To bandie Crownes, and Kingdomes to bestowe:  
> And sure thy worth, no lesse then hers doth seem to showe.
>
> But wote thou this, thou hardy *Titanesse*,  
> That not the worth of any liuing wight  
> May challenge ought in Heauens interesse;  
> Much lesse the Title of old *Titans* Right:  
> For, we by Conquest of our soueraine might,  
> And by eternall doome of Fates decree,  
> Haue wonne the Empire of the Heauens bright;  
> Which to our selues we hold, and to whom wee  
> Shall worthy deeme partakers of our blisse to bee.
>
> Then ceasse thy idle claime thou foolish gerle,  
> And seeke by grace and goodnesse to obtaine  
> That place from which by folly *Titan* fell;  
> There-to thou maist perhaps, if so thou faine  
> Haue *Ioue* thy gratious Lord and Soueraigne.  
> So, hauing said, she thus to him replide;  
> Ceasse *Saturnes* sonne, to seeke by proffers vaine  
> Of idle hopes t'allure mee to thy side,  
> For to betray my Right, before I haue it tride.
>
> But thee, ô *Ioue*, no equall Iudge I deeme  
> Of my desert, or of my dewfull Right;  
> That in thine owne behalfe maist partiall seeme:  
> But to the highest him, that is behight  
> Father of Gods and men by equall might;  
> To weet, the God of Nature, I appeale.  
> There-at *Ioue* wexed wroth, and in his spright  
> Did inly grudge, yet did it well conceale;  
> And bade *Dan Phoebus* Scribe her Appellation seale.
>
> Eftsoones the time and place appointed were,  
> Where all, both heauenly Powers, & earthly wights,  
> Before great Natures presence should appeare,  
> For triall of their Titles and best Rights:  
> That was, to weet, vpon the highest hights  
> Of *Arlo-hill* (Who knowes not *Arlo-hill?*)  
> That is the highest head (in all mens sights)  
> Of my old father *Mole*, whom Shepheards quill  
> Renowmed hath with hymnes fit for a rurall skill.
>
> And, were it not ill fitting for this file,  
> To sing of hilles & woods, mongst warres & Knights,  
> I would abate the sternenesse of my stile,  
> Mongst these sterne stounds to mingle soft delights;  
> And tell how *Arlo* through *Dianaes* spights  
> (Beeing of old the best and fairest Hill  
> That was in all this holy-Islands hights)  
> Was made the most vnpleasant, and most ill.  
> Meane while, ô *Clio*, lend *Calliope* thy quill.
>
> Whylome, when *IRELAND* florished in fame  
> Of wealths and goodnesse, far aboue the rest  
> Of all that beare the *British* Islands name,  
> The Gods then vs'd (for pleasure and for rest)  
> Oft to resort there-to, when seem'd them best:  
> But none of all there-in more pleasure found,  
> Then *Cynthia*; that is soueraine Queene profest  
> Of woods and forrests, which therein abound,  
> Sprinkled with wholsom waters, more thẽ most on ground.
>
> But mongst them all, as fittest for her game,  
> Either for chace of beasts with hound or boawe,  
> Or for to shroude in shade from *Phoebus* flame,  
> Or bathe in fountaines that doe freshly flowe,  
> Or from high hilles, or from the dales belowe,  
> She chose this *Arlo*; where shee did resort  
> With all her Nymphes enranged on a rowe,  
> With whom the woody Gods did oft consort:  
> For, with the Nymphes, the Satyres loue to play & sport.
>
> Amongst the which, there was a Nymph that hight  
> *Molanna*; daughter of old father *Mole*,  
> And sister vnto *Mulla*, faire and bright:  
> Vnto whose bed false *Bregog* whylome stole,  
> That Shepheard *Colin* dearely did condole,  
> And made her lucklesse loues well knowne to be.  
> But this *Molanna*, were she not so shole,  
> Were no lesse faire and beautifull then shee:  
> Yet as she is, a fairer flood may no man see.
>
> For, first, she springs out of two marble Rocks,  
> On which, a groue of Oakes high mounted growes,  
> That as a girlond seemes to deck the locks  
> Of som faire Bride, brought forth with pompous showes  
> Out of her bowre, that many flowers strowes:  
> So, through the flowry Dales she tumbling downe,  
> Through many woods, and shady coverts flowes  
> (That on each side her siluer channell crowne)  
> Till to the Plaine she come, whose Valleyes shee doth drowne.
>
> In her sweet streames, *Diana* vsed oft  
> (After her sweatie chace and toilesome play)  
> To bathe her selfe; and after, on the soft  
> And downy grasse, her dainty limbes to lay  
> In couert shade, where none behold her may:  
> For, much she hated sight of liuing eye.  
> Foolish God *Faunus*, though full many a day  
> He saw her clad, yet longed foolishly  
> To see her naked mongst her Nymphes in priuity.
>
> No way he found to compasse his desire,  
> But to corrupt *Molanna*, this her maid,  
> Her to discouer for some secret hire:  
> So, her with flattering words he first assaid;  
> And after, pleasing gifts for her purvaid,  
> Queene-apples, and red Cherries from the tree,  
> VVith which he her allured and betraid,  
> To tell what time he might her Lady see  
> When she her selfe did bathe, that he might secret bee.
>
> There-to hee promist, if shee would him pleasure  
> With this small boone, to quit her with a better;  
> To weet, that where-as shee had out of measure  
> Long lov'd the *Fanchin*, who by nought did set her,  
> That he would vndertake, for this to get her  
> To be his Loue, and of him liked well:  
> Besides all which, he vow'd to be her debter  
> For many moe good turnes then he would tell;  
> The least of which, this little pleasure should excell.
>
> The simple maid did yield to him anone;  
> And eft him placed where he close might view  
> That neuer any saw, saue onely one;  
> VVho, for his hire to so foole-hardy dew,  
> Was of his hounds devour'd in Hunters hew.  
> Tho, as her manner was on sunny day,  
> *Diana*, with her Nymphes about her, drew  
> To this sweet spring; where, doffing her array,  
> She bath'd her louely limbes, for *Ioue* a likely pray.
>
> There *Faunus* saw that pleased much his eye,  
> And made his hart to tickle in his brest,  
> That for great ioy of some-what he did spy,  
> He could him not containe in silent rest;  
> But breaking forth in laughter, loud profest  
> His foolish thought. O foolish *Faune* indeed,  
> That couldst not hold thy selfe so hidden blest,  
> But wouldest needs thine owne conceit areed.  
> Babblers vnworthy been of so diuine a meed.
>
> The Goddesse, all abashed with that noise,  
> In haste forth started from the guilty brooke;  
> And running straight where-as she heard his voice,  
> Enclos'd the bush about, and there him tooke,

> On her whose sight before so much he sought.  
> Thence, forth they drew him by the hornes, & shooke  
> Nigh all to peeces, that they left him nought;  
> And then into the open light they forth him brought.
>
> Like as an huswife, that with busie care  
> Thinks of her Dairie to make wondrous gaine,  
> Finding where-as some wicked beast vnware  
> That breakes into her Dayr'house, there doth draine  
> Her creaming pannes, and frustrate all her paine;  
> Hath in some snare or gin set close behind,  
> Entrapped him, and caught into her traine,  
> Then thinkes what punishment were best assign'd,  
> And thousand deathes deuiseth in her vengefull mind:
>
> So did *Diana* and her maydens all  
> Vse silly *Faunus*, now within their baile:  
> They mocke and scorne him, and him foule miscall;  
> Some by the nose him pluckt, some by the taile,  
> And by his goatish beard some did him haile:  
> Yet he (poore soule) with patience all did beare;  
> For, nought against their wils might countervaile:  
> Ne ought he said what euer he did heare;  
> But hanging downe his head, did like a Mome appeare.
>
> At length, when they had flouted him their fill,  
> They gan to cast what penaunce him to giue.  
> Some would haue gelt him, but that same would spill  
> The Wood-gods breed, which must for euer liue:  
> Others would through the riuer him haue driue,  
> And ducked deepe: but that seem'd penaunce light;  
> But most agreed and did this sentence giue,  
> Him in Deares skin to clad; & in that plight,  
> To hunt him with their hounds, him selfe saue how hee might.
>
> But *Cynthia's* selfe, more angry then the rest,  
> Thought not enough, to punish him in sport,  
> And of her shame to make a gamesome iest;  
> But gan examine him in straighter sort,  
> Which of her Nymphes, or other close consort,  
> Him thither brought, and her to him betraid?  
> He, much affeard, to her confessed short,  
> That 'twas *Molanna* which her so bewraid.  
> Then all attonce their hands vpon *Molanna* laid.
>
> But him (according as they had decreed)  
> With a Deeres-skin they couered, and then chast  
> With all their hounds that after him did speed;  
> But he more speedy, from them fled more fast  
> Then any Deere: so sore him dread aghast.  
> They after follow'd all with shrill out-cry,  
> Shouting as they the heauens would haue brast:  
> That all the woods and dales where he did flie,  
> Did ring againe, and loud reeccho to the skie.

> So they him follow'd till they weary were;  
> When, back returning to *Molann*' againe,  
> They, by commaund'ment of *Diana*, there  
> Her whelm'd with stones. Yet *Faunus* (for her paine)  
> Of her beloued *Fanchin* did obtaine,  
> That her he would receiue vnto his bed.  
> So now her waues passe through a pleasant Plaine,  
> Till with the *Fanchin* she her selfe doe wed,  
> And (both combin'd) themselues in one faire riuer spred.
>
> Nath'lesse, *Diana*, full of indignation,  
> Thence-forth abandond her delicious brooke;  
> In whose sweet streame, before that bad occasion,  
> So much delight to bathe her limbes she tooke:  
> Ne onely her, but also quite forsooke  
> All those faire forrests about *Arlo* hid,  
> And all that Mountaine, which doth over-looke  
> The richest champian that may else be rid,  
> And the faire *Shure*, in which are thousand Salmons bred.
>
> Them all, and all that she so deare did way,  
> Thence-forth she left; and parting from the place,  
> There-on an heauy haplesse curse did lay,  
> To weet, that Wolues, where she was wont to space,  
> Should harbour'd be, and all those Woods deface,  
> And Thieues should rob and spoile that Coast around.  
> Since which, those Woods, and all that goodly Chase,  
> Doth to this day with Wolues and Thieues abound:  
> Which too-too true that lands in-dwellers since haue foũd.
