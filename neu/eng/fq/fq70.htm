<blockquote>
<i>The saluage serues Matilda well<br>
till she Prince Arthure fynd,<br>
Who her together with his Squyre<br>
with th'Hermit leaues behynd.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
O
 What an easie thing is to descry<br>
The gentle bloud, how euer it be wrapt<br>
In sad misfortunes foule deformity,<br>
And wretched sorrowes, which haue often hapt?<br>
For howsoeuer it may grow mis-shapt,<br>
Like this wyld man, being vndisciplynd,<br>
That to all vertue it may seeme vnapt,<br>
Yet will it shew some sparkes of gentle mynd,<br>
And at the last breake forth in his owne proper kynd.<p>

That plainely may in this wyld man be red,<br>
Who though he were still in this desert wood,<br>
Mongst saluage beasts, both rudely borne and bred,<br>
Ne euer saw faire guize, ne learned good,<br>
Yet shewd some token of his gentle blood,<br>
By gentle vsage of that wretched Dame.<br>
For certes he was borne of noble blood,<br>
How euer by hard hap he hether came;<br>
As ye may know, when time shall be to tell the same.<p>

Who when as now long time he lacked had<br>
The good Sir <i>Calepine</i>, that farre was strayd,<br>
Did wexe exceeding sorrowfull and sad,<br>
As he of some misfortune were afrayd:<br>
And leauing there this Ladie all dismayd,<br>
Went forth streightway into the forrest wyde,<br>
To seeke, if he perchance a sleepe were layd,<br>
Or what so else were vnto him betyde:<br>
He sought him farre and neare, yet him no where he spyde.<p>

Tho backe returning to that sorie Dame,<br>
He shewed semblant of exceeding mone,<br>
By speaking signes, as he them best could frame;<br>
Now wringing both his wretched hands in one,<br>
Now beating his hard head vpon a stone,<br>
That ruth it was to see him so lament.<br>
By which she well perceiuing, what was done,<br>
Gan teare her hayre, and all her garments rent,<br>
And beat her breast, and piteously her selfe torment.<p>

Vpon the ground her selfe she fiercely threw,<br>
Regardlesse of her wounds, yet bleeding rife,<br>
That with their bloud did all the flore imbrew,<br>
As if her breast new launcht with murdrous knife,<br>
Would streight dislodge the wretched wearie life.<br>
There she long groueling, and deepe groning lay,<br>
As if her vitall powers were at strife<br>
With stronger death, and feared their decay,<br>
Such were this Ladies pangs and dolorous assay.<p>

Whom when the Saluage saw so sore distrest,<br>
He reared her vp from the bloudie ground,<br>
And sought by all the meanes, that he could best,<br>
Her to recure out of that stony swound,<br>
And staunch the bleeding of her dreary wound.<br>
Yet nould she be recomforted for nought,<br>
Ne cease her sorrow and impatient stound,<br>
But day and night did vexe her carefull thought,<br>
And euer more and more her owne affliction wrought.<p>

At length, when as no hope of his retourne<br>
She saw now left, she cast to leaue the place,<br>
And wend abrode, though feeble and forlorne,<br>
To seeke some comfort in that sorie case.<br>
His steede now strong through rest so long a space,<br>
Well as she could, she got, and did bedight,<br>
And being thereon mounted, forth did pace,<br>
Withouten guide, her to conduct aright,<br>
Or gard her to defend from bold oppressors might.<p>

Whom when her Host saw readie to depart,<br>
He would not suffer her alone to fare,<br>
But gan himselfe addresse to take her part.<br>
Those warlike armes, which <i>Calepine</i> whyleare<br>
Had left behind, he gan eftsoones prepare,<br>
And put them all about himselfe vnfit,<br>
His shield, his helmet, and his curats bare.<br>
But without sword vpon his thigh to sit:<br>
Sir <i>Calepine</i> himselfe away had hidden it.<p>

So forth they traueld an vneuen payre,<br>
That mote to all men seeme an vncouth sight;<br>
A saluage man matcht with a Ladie fayre,<br>
That rather seem'd the conquest of his might,<br>
Gotten by spoyle, then purchaced aright.<br>
But he did her attend most carefully,<br>
And faithfully did serue both day and night,<br>
Withouten thought of shame or villeny,<br>
Ne euer shewed signe of foule disloyalty.<p>

Vpon a day as on their way they went,<br>
It chaunst some furniture about her steed<br>
To be disordred by some accident:<br>
Which to redresse, she did th'assistance need<br>
Of this her groome, which he by signes did reede;<br>
And streight his combrous armes aside did lay<br>
Vpon the ground, withouten doubt or dreed,<br>
And in his homely wize began to assay<br>
T'amend what was amisse, and put in right aray.<p>

Bout which whilest he was busied thus hard,<br>
Lo where a knight together with his squire,<br>
All arm'd to point came ryding thetherward,<br>
Which seemed by their portance and attire,<br>
To be two errant knights, that did inquire<br>
After aduentures, where they mote them get.<br>
Those were to weet (if that ye it require)<br>
Prince <i>Arthur</i> and young <i>Timias</i>, which met<br>
By straunge occasion, that here needs forth be set.<p>

After that <i>Timias</i> had againe recured<br>
The fauour of <i>Belphebe</i>, (as ye heard)<br>
And of her grace did stand againe assured,<br>
To happie blisse he was full high vprear'd,<br>
Nether of enuy, nor of chaunge afeard,<br>
Though many foes did him maligne therefore,<br>
And with vniust detraction him did beard;<br>
Yet he himselfe so well and wisely bore,<br>
That in her soueraine lyking he dwelt euermore.<p>

But of them all, which did his ruine seeke<br>
Three mightie en'mies did him most despight,<br>
Three mightie ones, and cruell minded eeke,<br>
That him not onely sought by open might<br>
To ouerthrow, but to supplant by slight.<br>
The first of them by name was cald <i>Despetto</i>,<br>
Exceeding all the rest in powre and hight;<br>
The second not so strong but wise, <i>Decetto</i>;<br>
The third nor strong nor wise, but spightfullest <i>Defetto</i>.<p>

Oftimes their sundry powres they did employ,<br>
And seuerall deceipts, but all in vaine:<br>
For neither they by force could him destroy,<br>
Ne yet entrap in treasons subtill traine.<br>
Therefore conspiring all together plaine,<br>
They did their counsels now in one compound;<br>
Where singled forces faile, conioynd may gaine.<br>
The <i>Blatant Beast</i> the fittest meanes they found,<br>
To worke his vtter shame, and throughly him confound.<p>

Vpon a day as they the time did waite,<br>
When he did raunge the wood for saluage game,<br>
They sent that <i>Blatant Beast</i> to be a baite,<br>
To draw him from his deare beloued dame,<br>
Vnwares into the daunger of defame.<br>
For well they wist, that Squire to be so bold,<br>
That no one beast in forrest wylde or tame,<br>
Met him in chase, but he it challenge would,<br>
And plucke the pray oftimes out of their greedy hould.<p>

The hardy boy, as they deuised had,<br>
Seeing the vgly Monster passing by,<br>
Vpon him set, of perill nought adrad,<br>
Ne skilfull of the vncouth ieopardy;<br>
And charged him so fierce and furiously,<br>
That his great force vnable to endure,<br>
He forced was to turne from him and fly:<br>
Yet ere he fled, he with his tooth impure<br>
Him heedlesse bit, the whiles he was thereof secure.<p>

Securely he did after him pursew,<br>
Thinking by speed to ouertake his flight;<br>
Who through thicke woods and brakes &amp; briers him drew,<br>
To weary him the more, and waste his spight,<br>
So that he now has almost spent his spright.<br>
Till that at length vnto a woody glade<br>
He came, whose couert stopt his further sight,<br>
There his three foes shrowded in guilefull shade,<br>
Out of their ambush broke, and gan him to inuade.<p>

Sharpely they all attonce did him assaile,<br>
Burning with inward rancour and despight,<br>
And heaped strokes did round about him haile<br>
With so huge force, that seemed nothing might<br>
Beare off their blowes, from percing thorough quite.<br>
Yet he them all so warily did ward,<br>
That none of them in his soft flesh did bite,<br>
And all the while his backe for best safegard,<br>
He lent against a tree, that backeward onset bard.<p>

Like a wylde Bull, that being at a bay,<br>
Is bayted of a mastiffe, and a hound,<br>
And a curre-dog; that doe him sharpe assay<br>
On euery side, and beat about him round;<br>
But most that curre barking with bitter sownd,<br>
And creeping still behinde, doth him incomber,<br>
That in his chauffe he digs the trampled ground,<br>
And threats his horns, and bellowes like the thonder,<br>
So did that Squire his foes disperse, and driue asonder.<p>

Him well behoued so; for his three foes<br>
Sought to encompasse him on euery side,<br>
And dangerously did round about enclose.<br>
But most of all <i>Defetto</i> him annoyde,<br>
Creeping behinde him still to haue destroyde:<br>
So did <i>Decetto</i> eke him circumuent,<br>
But stout <i>Despetto</i> in his greater pryde,<br>
Did front him face to face against him bent,<br>
Yet he them all withstood, and often made relent.<p>

Till that at length nigh tyrd with former chace,<br>
And weary now with carefull keeping ward,<br>
He gan to shrinke, and somewhat to giue place,<br>
Full like ere long to haue escaped hard;<br>
When as vnwares he in the forrest heard<br>
A trampling steede, that with his neighing fast<br>
Did warne his rider be vppon his gard;<br>
With noise whereof the Squire now nigh aghast,<br>
Reuiued was, and sad dispaire away did cast.<p>

Eftsoones he spide a Knight approching nye,<br>
Who seeing one in so great daunger set<br>
Mongst many foes, him selfe did faster hye;<br>
To reskue him, and his weake part abet,<br>
For pitty so to see him ouerset.<br>
Whom soone as his three enemies did vew,<br>
They fled, and fast into the wood did get:<br>
Him booted not to thinke them to pursew,<br>
The couert was so thicke, that did no passage shew.<p>

Then turning to that swaine, him well he knew<br>
To be his <i>Timias</i>, his owne true Squire,<br>
Whereof exceeding glad, he to him drew,<br>
And him embracing twixt his armes entire,<br>
Him thus bespake; My liefe, my lifes desire,<br>
Why haue ye me alone thus long yleft?<br>
Tell me what worlds despight, or heauens yre<br>
Hath you thus long away from me bereft?<br>
Where haue ye all this while bin wandring, where bene weft?<p>

With that he sighed deepe for inward tyne:<br>
To whom the Squire nought aunswered againe,<br>
But shedding few soft teares from tender eyne,<br>
His deare affect with silence did restraine,<br>
And shut vp all his plaint in priuy paine.<br>
There they awhile some gracious speaches spent,<br>
As to them seemed fit time to entertaine.<br>
After all which vp to their steedes they went,<br>
And forth together rode a comely couplement.<p>

So now they be arriued both in sight<br>
Of this wyld man, whom they full busie found<br>
About the sad <i>Serena</i> things to dight,<br>
With those braue armours lying on the ground,<br>
That seem'd the spoile of some right well renownd.<br>
Which when that Squire beheld, he to them stept,<br>
Thinking to take them from that hylding hound:<br>
But he it seeing, lightly to him lept,<br>
And sternely with strong hand it from his handling kept.<p>

Gnashing his grinded teeth with griesly looke,<br>
And sparkling fire out of his furious eyne,<br>
Him with his fist vnwares on th'head he strooke,<br>
That made him downe vnto the earth encline;<br>
Whence soone vpstarting much he gan repine,<br>
And laying hand vpon his wrathfull blade,<br>
Thought therewithall forthwith him to haue slaine,<br>
Who it perceiuing, hand vpon him layd,<br>
And greedily him griping, his auengement stayd.<p>

With that aloude the faire <i>Serena</i> cryde<br>
Vnto the Knight, them to dispart in twaine:<br>
Who to them stepping did them soone diuide,<br>
And did from further violence restraine,<br>
Albe the wyld-man hardly would refraine.<br>
Then gan the Prince, of her for to demand,<br>
What and from whence she was, and by what traine<br>
She fell into that saluage villaines hand,<br>
And whether free with him she now were, or in band.<p>

To whom she thus; I am, as now ye see,<br>
The wretchedst Dame, that liue this day on ground;<br>
Who both in minde, the which most grieueth me,<br>
And body haue receiu'd a mortall wound,<br>
That hath me driuen to this drery stound.<br>
I was erewhile, the loue of <i>Calepine</i>:<br>
Who whether he aliue be to be found,<br>
Or by some deadly chaunce be done to pine,<br>
Since I him lately lost, vneath is to define.<p>

In saluage forrest I him lost of late,<br>
Where I had surely long ere this bene dead,<br>
Or else remained in most wretched state,<br>
Had not this wylde man in that wofull stead<br>
Kept, and deliuered me from deadly dread.<br>
In such a saluage wight, of brutish kynd,<br>
Amongst wilde beastes in desert forrests bred,<br>
It is most straunge and wonderfull to fynd<br>
So milde humanity, and perfect gentle mynd.<p>

Let me therefore this fauour for him finde,<br>
That ye will not your wrath vpon him wreake,<br>
Sith he cannot expresse his simple minde,<br>
Ne yours conceiue, ne but by tokens speake:<br>
Small praise to proue your powre on wight so weake.<br>
With such faire words she did their heate asswage,<br>
And the strong course of their displeasure breake,<br>
That they to pitty turnd their former rage,<br>
And each sought to supply the office of her page.<p>

So hauing all things well about her dight,<br>
She on her way cast forward to proceede,<br>
And they her forth conducted, where they might<br>
Finde harbour fit to comfort her great neede.<br>
For now her wounds corruption gan to breed;<br>
And eke this Squire, who likewise wounded was<br>
Of that same Monster late, for lacke of heed,<br>
Now gan to faint, and further could not pas<br>
Through feeblenesse, which all his limbes oppressed has.<p>

So forth they rode together all in troupe,<br>
To seeke some place, the which mote yeeld some ease<br>
To these sicke twaine, that now began to droupe,<br>
And all the way the Prince sought to appease<br>
The bitter anguish of their sharpe disease,<br>
By all the courteous meanes he could inuent;<br>
Somewhile with merry purpose fit to please,<br>
And otherwhile with good encouragement,<br>
To make them to endure the pains, did them torment.<p>

Mongst which, <i>Serena</i> did to him relate<br>
The foule discourt'sies and vnknightly parts,<br>
Which <i>Turpine</i> had vnto her shewed late,<br>
Without compassion of her cruell smarts:<br>
Although <i>Blandina</i> did with all her arts<br>
Him otherwise perswade, all that she might;<br>
Yet he of malice, without her desarts,<br>
Not onely her excluded late at night,<br>
But also trayterously did wound her weary Knight.<p>

Wherewith the Prince sore moued, there auoud,<br>
That soone as he returned backe againe,<br>
He would auenge th'abuses of that proud<br>
And shamefull Knight, of whom she did complaine.<br>
This wize did they each other entertaine,<br>
To passe the tedious trauell of the way;<br>
Till towards night they came vnto a plaine,<br>
By which a little Hermitage there lay,<br>
Far from all neighbourhood, the which annoy it may.<p>

And nigh thereto a little Chappell stoode,<br>
Which being all with Yuy ouerspred,<br>
Deckt all the roofe, and shadowing the roode,<br>
Seem'd like a groue faire braunched ouer hed:<br>
Therein the Hermite, which his life here led<br>
In streight obseruaunce of religious vow,<br>
Was wont his howres and holy things to bed;<br>
And therein he likewise was praying now,<br>
Whenas these Knights arriu'd, they wist not where nor how.<p>

They stayd not there, but streight way in did pas.<br>
Whom when the Hermite present saw in place,<br>
From his deuotion streight he troubled was;<br>
Which breaking of he toward them did pace,<br>
With stayed steps, and graue beseeming grace:<br>
For well it seem'd, that whilome he had beene<br>
Some goodly person, and of gentle race,<br>
That could his good to all, and well did weene,<br>
How each to entertaine with curt'sie well beseene,<p>

And soothly it was sayd by common fame,<br>
So long as age enabled him thereto,<br>
That he had bene a man of mickle name,<br>
Renowmed much in armes and derring doe:<br>
But being aged now and weary to<br>
Of warres delight, and worlds contentious toyle,<br>
The name of knighthood he did disauow,<br>
And hanging vp his armes and warlike spoyle,<br>
From all this worlds incombraunce did himselfe assoyle.<p>

He thence them led into his Hermitage,<br>
Letting their steedes to graze vpon the Green:<br>
Small was his house, and like a little cage,<br>
For his owne turne, yet inly neate and clene,<br>
Deckt with greene boughes, and flowers gay beseene.<br>
Therein he them full faire did entertaine<br>
Not with such forged showes, as fitter beene<br>
For courting fooles, that curtesies would faine,<br>
But with entire affection and appearaunce plaine.<p>

Yet was their fare but homely, such as hee<br>
Did vse, his feeble body to sustaine;<br>
The which full gladly they did take in glee,<br>
Such as it was, ne did of want complaine,<br>
But being well suffiz'd, them rested faine.<br>
But faire <i>Serene</i> all night could take no rest,<br>
Ne yet that gentle Squire, for grieuous paine<br>
Of their late woundes, the which the <i>Blatant Beast</i><br>
Had giuen them, whose griefe through suffraunce sore increast.<p>

So all that night they past in great disease,<br>
Till that the morning, bringing earely light<br>
To guide mens labours, brought them also ease,<br>
And some asswagement of their painefull plight.<br>
Then vp they rose, and gan them selues to dight<br>
Vnto their iourney; but that Squire and Dame<br>
So faint and feeble were, that they ne might<br>
Endure to trauell, nor one foote to frame:<br>
Their hearts were sicke, their sides were sore, their feete were lame.<p>

Therefore the Prince, whom great affaires in mynd<br>
Would not permit, to make their lenger stay,<br>
Was forced there to leaue them both behynd,<br>
In that good Hermits charge, whom he did pray<br>
To tend them well.  So forth he went his way,<br>
And with him eke the saluage, that whyleare<br>
Seeing his royall vsage and array,<br>
Was greatly growne in loue of that braue pere,<br>
Would needes depart, as shall declared be elsewhere.<p>
