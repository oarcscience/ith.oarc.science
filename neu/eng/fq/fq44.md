*Cant. V.*

> *The Ladies for the Girdle striue  
> of famous Florimell:  
> Scudamour comming to Cares house,  
> doth sleepe from him expell.*

> I T hath bene through all ages euer seene,  
> That with the praise of armes and cheualrie,  
> The prize of beautie still hath ioyned beene;  
> And that for reasons speciall priuitie:  
> For either doth on other much relie.  
> For he me seemes most fit the faire to serue,  
> That can her best defend from villenie;  
> And she most fit his seruice doth deserue,  
> That fairest is and from her faith will neuer swerue.
>
> So fitly now here commeth next in place,  
> After the proofe of prowesse ended well,  
> The controuerse of beauties soueraine grace;  
> In which to her that doth the most excell,  
> Shall fall the girdle of faire *Florimell*:  
> That many wish to win for glorie vaine,  
> And not for vertuous vse, which some doe tell  
> That glorious belt did in it selfe containe,  
> Which Ladies ought to loue, and seeke for to obtaine.
>
> That girdle gaue the vertue of chast loue,  
> And wiuehood true, to all that did it beare;  
> But whosoeuer contrarie doth proue,  
> Might not the same about her middle weare.  
> But it would loose, or else a sunder teare.  
> Whilome it was (as Faeries wont report)  
> Dame *Venus* girdle, by her steemed deare,  
> What time she vsd to liue in wiuely sort;  
> But layd aside, when so she vsd her looser sport.
>
> Her husband *Vulcan* whylome for her sake,  
> When first he loued her with heart entire,  
> This pretious ornament they say did make,  
> And wrought in *Lemno* with vnquenched fire:  
> And afterwards did for her loues first hire,  
> Giue it to her, for euer to remaine,  
> Therewith to bind lasciuious desire,  
> And loose affections streightly to restraine;  
> Which vertue it for euer after did retaine.
>
> The same one day, when she her selfe disposd  
> To visite her beloued Paramoure,  
> The God of warre, she from her middle loosd,  
> And left behind her in her secret bowre,  
> On *Acidalian* mount, where many an howre  
> She with the pleasant *Graces* wont to play.  
> There *Florimell* in her first ages flowre  
> Was fostered by those *Graces*, (as they say)  
> And brought with her fro˜ thence that goodly belt away.
>
> That goodly belt was *Cestus* hight by name,  
> And as her life by her esteemed deare.  
> No wonder then, if that to winne the same  
> So many Ladies sought, as shall appeare;  
> For pearelesse she was thought, that did it beare.  
> And now by this their feast all being ended,  
> The iudges which thereto selected were,  
> Into the Martian field adowne descended,  
> To deeme this doutfull case, for which they all cõtended.
>
> But first was question made, which of those Knights  
> That lately turneyd, had the wager wonne:  
> There was it iudged by those worthie wights,  
> That *Satyrane* the first day best had donne:  
> For he last ended, hauing first begonne.  
> The second was to *Triamond* behight,  
> For that he sau'd the victour from fordonne:  
> For *Cambell* victour was in all mens sight,  
> Till by mishap he in his foemens hand did light.
>
> The third dayes prize vnto that straunger Knight,  
> Whom all men term'd Knight of the Hebene speare,  
> To *Britomart* was giuen by good right;  
> For that with puissant stroke she downe did beare  
> The *Saluage* Knight, that victour was whileare,  
> And all the rest, which had the best afore,  
> And to the last vnconquer'd did appeare;  
> For last is deemed best. To her therefore  
> The fayrest Ladie was adiudgd for Paramore.
>
> But thereat greatly grudged *Arthegall*,  
> And much repynd, that both of victors meede,  
> And eke of honour she did him forestall.  
> Yet mote he not withstand, what was decreede;  
> But inly thought of that despightfull deede  
> Fit time t'awaite auenged for to bee.  
> This being ended thus, and all agreed,  
> Then next ensew'd the Paragon to see  
> Of beauties praise, and yeeld the fayrest her due fee.
>
> Then first *Cambello* brought vnto their view  
> His faire *Cambina*, couered with a veale;  
> Which being once withdrawne, most perfect hew  
> And passing beautie did eftsoones reueale,  
> That able was weake harts away to steale.  
> Next did Sir *Triamond* vnto their sight  
> The face of his deare *Canacee* vnheale;  
> Whose beauties beame eftsoones did shine so bright,  
> That daz'd the eyes of all, as with exceeding light.
>
> And after her did *Paridell* produce  
> His false *Duessa*, that she might be seene;  
> Who with her forged beautie did seduce  
> The hearts of some, that fairest her did weene;  
> As diuerse wits affected diuers beene.  
> Then did Sir *Ferramont* vnto them shew  
> His *Lucida*, that was full faire and sheene,  
> And after these an hundred Ladies moe  
> Appear'd in place, the which each other did outgoe.
>
> All which who so dare thinke for to enchace,  
> Him needeth sure a golden pen I weene,  
> To tell the feature of each goodly face.  
> For since the day that they created beene,  
> So many heauenly faces were not seene  
> Assembled in one place: ne he that thought  
> For *Chian* folke to pourtraict beauties Queene,  
> By view of all the fairest to him brought,  
> So many faire did see, as here he might haue sought.
>
> At last the most redoubted *Britonesse*,  
> Her louely *Amoret* did open shew;  
> Whose face discouered, plainely did expresse  
> The heauenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew.  
> Well weened all, which her that time did vew,  
> That she should surely beare the bell away,  
> Till *Blandamour*, who thought he had the trew  
> And very *Florimell*, did her display:  
> The sight of whom once seene did all the rest dismay.
>
> For all afore that seemed fayre and bright,  
> Now base and contemptible did appeare,  
> Compar'd to her, that shone as Phebes light,  
> Amongst the lesser starres in euening cleare.  
> All that her saw with wonder rauisht weare,  
> And weend no mortall creature she should bee,  
> But some celestiall shape, that flesh did beare:  
> Yet all were glad there *Florimell* to see;  
> Yet thought that *Florimell* was not so faire as shee.
>
> As guilefull Goldsmith that by secret skill,  
> With golden foyle doth finely ouer spred  
> Some baser metall, which commend he will  
> Vnto the vulgar for good gold insted,  
> He much more goodly glosse thereon doth shed,  
> To hide his falshood, then if it were trew:  
> So hard, this Idole was to be ared,  
> That *Florimell* her selfe in all mens vew  
> She seem'd to passe: so forged things do fairest shew.
>
> Then was that golden belt by doome of all  
> Graunted to her, as to the fayrest Dame.  
> Which being brought, about her middle small  
> They thought to gird, as best it her became;  
> But by no meanes they could it thereto frame.  
> For euer as they fastned it, it loos'd  
> And fell away, as feeling secret blame.  
> Full oft about her wast she it enclos'd;  
> And it as oft was from about her wast disclos'd.
>
> That all men wondred at the vncouth sight,  
> And each one thought, as to their fancies came.  
> But she her selfe did thinke it doen for spight,  
> And touched was with secret wrath and shame  
> Therewith, as thing deuiz'd her to defame.  
> Then many other Ladies likewise tride,  
> About their tender loynes to knit the same;  
> But it would not on none of them abide,  
> But when they thought it fast, eftsoones it was vntide.
>
> Which when that scornefull *Squire of Dames* did vew,  
> He lowdly gan to laugh, and thus to iest;  
> Alas for pittie that so faire a crew,  
> As like can not be seene from East to West,  
> Cannot find one this girdle to inuest.  
> Fie on the man, that did it first inuent,  
> To shame vs all with this, *Vngirt vnblest*.  
> Let neuer Ladie to his loue assent,  
> That hath this day so many so vnmanly shent.
>
> Thereat all Knights gan laugh, and Ladies lowre:  
> Till that at last the gentle *Amoret*  
> Likewise assayd, to proue that girdles powre;  
> And hauing it about her middle set,  
> Did find it fit, withouten breach or let.  
> Whereat the rest gan greatly to enuie:  
> But *Florimell* exceedingly did fret,  
> And snatching from her hand halfe angrily  
> The belt againe, about her bodie gan it tie.
>
> Yet nathemore would it her bodie fit;  
> Yet nathelesse to her, as her dew right,  
> It yeelded was by them, that iudged it:  
> And she her selfe adiudged to the Knight,  
> That bore the Hebene speare, as wonne in fight.  
> But *Britomart* would not thereto assent,  
> Ne her owne *Amoret* forgoe so light  
> For that strange Dame, whose beauties wonderment  
> She lesse esteem'd, then th'others vertuous gouernment.
>
> Whom when the rest did see her to refuse,  
> They were full glad, in hope themselues to get her:  
> Yet at her choice they all did greatly muse.  
> But after that the Iudges did arret her  
> Vnto the second best, that lou'd her better;  
> That was the *Saluage* Knight: but he was gone  
> In great displeasure, that he could not get her.  
> Then was she iudged *Triamond* his one;  
> But *Triamond* lou'd *Canacee*, and other none.
>
> Tho vnto *Satyran* she was adiudged,  
> Who was right glad to gaine so goodly meed:  
> But *Blandamour* thereat full greatly grudged,  
> And litle prays'd his labours euill speed,  
> That for to winne the saddle, lost the steed.  
> Ne lesse thereat did *Paridell* complaine,  
> And thought t'appeale from that, which was decreed,  
> To single combat with Sir *Satyrane*.  
> Thereto him *Ate* stird, new discord to maintaine.
>
> And eke with these, full many other Knights  
> She through her wicked working did incense,  
> Her to demaund, and chalenge as their rights,  
> Deserued for their perils recompense.  
> Amongst the rest with boastfull vaine pretense  
> Stept *Braggadochio* forth, and as his thrall  
> Her claym'd, by him in battell wonne long sens:  
> Whereto her selfe he did to witnesse call;  
> Who being askt, accordingly confessed all.
>
> Thereat exceeding wroth was *Satyran*;  
> And wroth with *Satyran* was *Blandamour*;  
> And wroth with *Blandamour* was *Eriuan*;  
> And at them both Sir *Paridell* did loure.  
> So all together stird vp strifull stoure,  
> And readie were new battell to darraine.  
> Each one profest to be her paramoure,  
> And vow'd with speare and shield it to maintaine;  
> Ne Iudges powre, ne reasons rule mote them restraine.
>
> Which troublous stirre when *Satyrane* auiz'd:  
> He gan to cast how to appease the same,  
> And to accord them all, this meanes deuiz'd:  
> First in the midst to set that fayrest Dame,  
> To whom each one his chalenge should disclame,  
> And he himselfe his right would eke releasse:  
> Then looke to whom she voluntarie came,  
> He should without disturbance her possesse:  
> Sweete is the loue that comes alone with willingnesse.
>
> They all agreed, and then that snowy Mayd  
> Was in the middest plast among them all;  
> All on her gazing wisht, and vowd, and prayd,  
> And to the Queene of beautie close did call,  
> That she vnto their portion might befall.  
> Then when she long had lookt vpon each one,  
> As though she wished to haue pleasd them all,  
> At last to *Braggadochio* selfe alone  
> She came of her accord, in spight of all his fone.
>
> Which when they all beheld they chaft and rag'd,  
> And woxe nigh mad for very harts despight,  
> That from reuenge their willes they scarse asswag'd:  
> Some thought from him her to haue reft by might;  
> Some proffer made with him for her to fight.  
> But he nought car'd for all that they could say:  
> For he their words as wind esteemed light.  
> Yet not fit place he thought it there to stay,  
> But secretly from thence that night her bore away.
>
> They which remaynd, so soone as they perceiu'd,  
> That she was gone, departed thence with speed,  
> And follow'd them, in mind her to haue reau'd  
> From wight vnworthie of so noble meed.  
> In which poursuit how each one did succeede,  
> Shall else be told in order, as it fell.  
> But now of *Britomart* it here doth neede,  
> The hard aduentures and strange haps to tell;  
> Since with the rest she went not after *Florimell*.
>
> For soone as she them saw to discord set,  
> Her list no longer in that place abide;  
> But taking with her louely *Amoret*,  
> Vpon her first aduenture forth did ride,  
> To seeke her lou'd, making blind Loue her guide.  
> Vnluckie Mayd to seeke her enemie!  
> Vnluckie Mayd to seeke him farre and wide,  
> Whom, when he was vnto her selfe most nie,  
> She through his late disguizeme˜t could him not descrie.
>
> So much the more her griefe, the more her toyle:  
> Yet neither toyle nor griefe she once did spare,  
> In seeking him, that should her paine assoyle;  
> Whereto great comfort in her sad misfare  
> Was *Amoret*, companion of her care:  
> Who likewise sought her louer long miswent,  
> The gentle *Scudamour*, whose hart whileare  
> That stryfull hag with gealous discontent  
> Had fild, that he to fell reueng was fully bent.
>
> Bent to reuenge on blamelesse *Britomart*  
> The crime, which cursed *Ate* kindled earst,  
> The which like thornes did pricke his gealous hart,  
> And through his soule like poysned arrow perst,  
> That by no reason it might be reuerst,  
> For ought that *Glauce* could or doe or say.  
> For aye the more that she the same reherst,  
> The more it gauld, and grieu'd him night and day,  
> That nought but dire reuenge his anger mote defray.
>
> So as they trauelled, the drouping night  
> Couered with cloudie storme and bitter showre,  
> That dreadfull seem'd to euery liuing wight,  
> Vpon them fell, before her timely howre;  
> That forced them to seeke some couert bowre,  
> Where they might hide their heads in quiet rest,  
> And shrowd their persons from that stormie stowre.  
> Not farre away, not meete for any guest  
> They spide a little cottage, like some poore mans nest.
>
> Vnder a steepe hilles side it placed was,  
> There where the mouldred earth had cav'd the banke;  
> And fast beside a little brooke did pas  
> Of muddie water, that like puddle stanke;  
> By which few crooked sallowes grew in ranke:  
> Whereto approaching nigh, they heard the sound  
> Of many yron hammers beating ranke,  
> And answering their wearie turnes around,  
> That seemed some blacksmith dwelt in that desert grou˜d.
>
> There entring in, they found the goodman selfe,  
> Full busily vnto his worke ybent;  
> Who was to weet a wretched wearish elfe,  
> With hollow eyes and rawbone cheekes forspent,  
> As if he had in prison long bene pent:  
> Full blacke and griesly did his face appeare,  
> Besmeard with smoke that nigh his eye-sight blent;  
> With rugged beard, and hoarie shagged heare,  
> The which he neuer wont to combe, or comely sheare.
>
> Rude was his garment, and to rags all rent,  
> Ne better had he, ne for better cared:  
> With blistred hands emongst the cinders brent,  
> And fingers filthie, with long nayles vnpared,  
> Right fit to rend the food, on which he fared.  
> His name was *Care*; a blacksmith by his trade,  
> That neither day nor night from working spared,  
> But to small purpose yron wedges made;  
> Those be vnquiet thoughts, that carefull minds inuade.
>
> In which his worke he had sixe seruants prest,  
> About the Andvile standing euermore,  
> With huge great hammers, that did neuer rest  
> From heaping stroakes, which thereon soused sore:  
> All sixe strong groomes, but one then other more:  
> For by degrees they all were disagreed;  
> So likewise did the hammers which they bore,  
> Like belles in greatnesse orderly succeed,  
> That he which was the last, the first did farre exceede.
>
> He like a monstrous Gyant seem'd in sight,  
> Farre passing *Bronteus*, or *Pynacmon* great,  
> The which in *Lipari* doe day and night  
> Frame thunderbolts for *Ioues* auengefull threate.  
> So dreadfully he did the anduile beat,  
> That seem'd to dust he shortly would it driue:  
> So huge his hammer and so fierce his heat,  
> That seem'd a rocke of Diamond it could riue,  
> And rend a sunder quite, if he thereto list striue.
>
> Sir *Scudamour* there entring, much admired  
> The manner of their worke and wearie paine;  
> And hauing long beheld, at last enquired  
> The cause and end thereof: but all in vaine;  
> For they for nought would from their worke refraine,  
> Ne let his speeches come vnto their eare.  
> And eke the breathfull bellowes blew amaine,  
> Like to the Northren winde, that none could heare:  
> Those *Pensifenesse* did moue; and *Sighes* the bellows weare.
>
> Which when that warriour saw, he said no more,  
> But in his armour layd him downe to rest:  
> To rest he layd him downe vpon the flore,  
> (Whylome for ventrous Knights the bedding best)  
> And thought his wearie limbs to haue redrest.  
> And that old aged Dame, his faithfull Squire,  
> Her feeble ioynts layd eke a downe to rest;  
> That needed much her weake age to desire,  
> After so long a trauell, which them both did tire.
>
> There lay Sir *Scudamour* long while expecting,  
> When gentle sleepe his heauie eyes would close;  
> Oft chaunging sides, and oft new place electing,  
> Where better seem'd he mote himselfe repose;  
> And oft in wrath he thence againe vprose;  
> And oft in wrath he layd him downe againe.  
> But wheresoeuer he did himselfe dispose,  
> He by no meanes could wished ease obtaine:  
> So euery place seem'd painefull, and ech changing vaine.
>
> And euermore, when he to sleepe did thinke,  
> The hammers sound his senses did molest;  
> And euermore, when he began to winke,  
> The bellowes noyse disturb'd his quiet rest,  
> Ne suffred sleepe to settle in his brest.  
> And all the night the dogs did barke and howle  
> About the house, at sent of stranger guest:  
> And now the crowing Cocke, and now the Owle  
> Lowde shriking him afflicted to the very sowle.
>
> And if by fortune any litle nap  
> Vpon his heauie eye-lids chaunst to fall,  
> Eftsoones one of those villeins him did rap  
> Vpon his headpeece with his yron mall;  
> That he was soone awaked therewithall,  
> And lightly started vp as one affrayd;  
> Or as if one him suddenly did call.  
> So oftentimes he out of sleepe abrayd,  
> And then lay musing long, on that him ill apayd.
>
> So long he muzed, and so long he lay,  
> That at the last his wearie sprite opprest  
> With fleshly weaknesse, which no creature may  
> Long time resist, gaue place to kindly rest,  
> That all his senses did full soone arrest:  
> Yet in his soundest sleepe, his dayly feare  
> His ydle braine gan busily molest,  
> And made him dreame those two disloyall were:  
> The things that day most minds, at night doe most appeare.
>
> With that, the wicked carle the maister Smith  
> A paire of redwhot yron tongs did take  
> Out of the burning cinders, and therewith  
> Vnder his side him nipt, that forst to wake,  
> He felt his hart for very paine to quake,  
> And started vp auenged for to be  
> On him, the which his quiet slomber brake:  
> Yet looking round about him none could see;  
> Yet did the smart remaine, though he himselfe did flee.
>
> In such disquiet and hartfretting payne,  
> He all that night, that too long night did passe.  
> And now the day out of the Ocean mayne  
> Began to peepe aboue this earthly masse,  
> With pearly dew sprinkling the morning grasse:  
> Then vp he rose like heauie lumpe of lead,  
> That in his face, as in a looking glasse,  
> The signes of anguish one mote plainely read,  
> And ghesse the man to be dismayd with gealous dread.
>
> Vnto his lofty steede he clombe anone,  
> And forth vpon his former voiage fared,  
> And with him eke that aged Squire attone;  
> Who whatsoeuer perill was prepared,  
> Both equall paines and equall perill shared:  
> The end whereof and daungerous euent  
> Shall for another canticle be spared.  
> But here my wearie teeme nigh ouer spent  
> Shall breath it selfe awhile, after so long a went.
