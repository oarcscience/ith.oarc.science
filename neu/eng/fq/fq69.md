*Cant. IIII.*

> *Calepine by a saluage man  
> from Turpine reskewed is;  
> And whylest an Infant from a Beare  
> he saues, his loue doth misse.*

> L Ike as a ship with dreadfull storme long tost,  
> Hauing spent all her mastes and her ground-hold,  
> Now farre from harbour likely to be lost,  
> At last some fisher barke doth neare behold,  
> That giueth comfort to her courage cold.  
> Such was the state of this most courteous knight  
> Being oppressed by that faytour bold,  
> That he remayned in most perilous plight,  
> And his sad Ladie left in pitifull affright.
>
> Till that by fortune, passing all foresight,  
> A saluage man, which in those woods did wonne,  
> Drawne with that Ladies loud and piteous shright,  
> Toward the same incessantly did ronne,  
> To vnderstand what there was to be donne.  
> There he this most discourteous crauen found,  
> As fiercely yet, as when he first begonne,  
> Chasing the gentle *Calepine* around,  
> Ne sparing him the more for all his grieuous wound.
>
> The saluage man, that neuer till this houre  
> Did taste of pittie, neither gentlesse knew,  
> Seeing his sharpe assault and cruell stoure  
> Was much emmoued at his perils vew,  
> That euen his ruder hart began to rew,  
> And feele compassion of his euill plight  
> Against his foe that did him so pursew:  
> From whom he meant to free him, if he might,  
> And him auenge of that so villenous despight.
>
> Yet armes or weapon had he none to fight,  
> Ne knew the vse of warlike instruments,  
> Saue such as sudden rage him lent to smite,  
> But naked without needfull vestiments,  
> To clad his corpse with meete habiliments,  
> He cared not for dint of sword nor speere,  
> No more then for the stroke of strawes or bents:  
> For from his mothers wombe, which him did beare  
> He was invulnerable made by Magicke leare.
>
> He stayed not t'aduize, which way were best  
> His foe t'assayle, or how himselfe to gard,  
> But with fierce fury and with force infest  
> Vpon him ran; who being well prepard,  
> His first assault full warily did ward,  
> And with the push of his sharp-pointed speare  
> Full on the breast him strooke, so strong and hard,  
> That forst him backe recoyle, and reele areare;  
> Yet in his bodie made no wound nor bloud appeare.
>
> With that the wyld man more enraged grew,  
> Like to a Tygre that hath mist his pray,  
> And with mad mood againe vpon him flew,  
> Regarding neither speare, that mote him flay,  
> Nor his fierce steed, that mote him much dismay,  
> The saluage nation doth all dread despize:  
> Tho on his shield he griple hold did lay,  
> And held the same so hard, that by no wize  
> He could him force to loose, or leaue his enterprize.
>
> Long did he wrest and wring it to and fro,  
> And euery way did try, but all in vaine:  
> For he would not his greedie grype forgoe,  
> But hayld and puld with all his might and maine,  
> That from his steed him nigh he drew againe.  
> Who hauing now no vse of his long speare,  
> So nigh at hand, nor force his shield to straine,  
> Both speare and shield, as things that needlesse were,  
> He quite forsooke, and fled himselfe away for feare.
>
> But after him the wyld man ran apace  
> And him pursewed with importune speed,  
> (For he was swift as any Bucke in chace)  
> And had he not in his extreamest need,  
> Bene helped through the swiftnesse of his steed,  
> He had him ouertaken in his flight.  
> Who euer, as he saw him nigh succeed,  
> Gan cry aloud with horrible affright,  
> And shrieked out, a thing vncomely for a knight.
>
> But when the Saluage saw his labour vaine,  
> In following of him, that fled so fast,  
> He wearie woxe, and backe return'd againe  
> With speede vnto the place, whereas he last  
> Had left that couple, nere their vtmost cast.  
> There he that knight full sorely bleeding found  
> And eke the Ladie fearefully aghast,  
> Both for the perill of the present stound,  
> And also for the sharpnesse of her rankling wound.
>
> For though she were right glad, so rid to bee  
> From that vile lozell, which her late offended,  
> Yet now no lesse encombrance she did see,  
> And perill by this saluage man pretended;  
> Gainst whom she saw no meanes to be defended,  
> By reason that her knight was wounded sore.  
> Therefore her selfe she wholy recommended  
> To Gods sole grace, whom she did oft implore,  
> To send her succour, being of all hope forlore.
>
> But the wyld man, contrarie to her feare,  
> Came to her creeping like a fawning hound,  
> And by rude tokens made to her appeare  
> His deepe compassion of her dolefull stound,  
> Kissing his hands, and crouching to the ground;  
> For other language had he none nor speach,  
> But a soft murmure, and confused sound  
> Of senselesse words, which nature did him teach,  
> T'expresse his passions, which his reason did empeach.
>
> And comming likewise to the wounded knight,  
> When he beheld the streames of purple blood  
> Yet flowing fresh, as moued with the sight,  
> He made great mone after his saluage mood:  
> And running streight into the thickest wood,  
> A certaine herbe from thence vnto him brought,  
> Whose vertue he by vse well vnderstood:  
> The iuyce whereof into his wound he wrought,  
> And stopt the bleeding straight, ere he it staunched thought.
>
> Then taking vp that Recreants shield and speare,  
> Which earst he left, he signes vnto them made,  
> With him to wend vnto his wonning neare:  
> To which he easily did them perswade.  
> Farre in the forrest by a hollow glade,  
> Couered with mossie shrubs, which spredding brode  
> Did vnderneath them make a gloomy shade;  
> Where foot of liuing creature neuer troade,  
> Ne scarse wyld beasts durst come, there was this wights abode.
>
> Thether he brought these vnacquainted guests;  
> To whom faire semblance, as he could, he shewed  
> By signes, by lookes, and all his other gests.  
> But the bare ground, with hoarie mosse bestrowed,  
> Must be their bed, their pillow was vnsowed,  
> And the frutes of the forrest was their feast:  
> For their bad Stuard neither plough'd nor sowed,  
> Ne fed on flesh, ne euer of wyld beast  
> Did taste the bloud, obaying natures first beheast.
>
> Yet howsoeuer base and meane it were,  
> They tooke it well, and thanked God for all,  
> Which had them freed from that deadly feare,  
> And sau'd from being to that caitiue thrall.  
> Here they of force (as fortune now did fall)  
> Compelled were themselues a while to rest,  
> Glad of that easement, though it were but small;  
> That hauing there their wounds awhile redrest,  
> They mote the abler be to passe vnto the rest.
>
> During which time, that wyld man did apply  
> His best endeuour, and his daily paine,  
> In seeking all the woods both farre and nye  
> For herbes to dresse their wounds; still seeming faine,  
> When ought he did, that did their lyking gaine.  
> So as ere long he had that knightes wound  
> Recured well, and made him whole againe:  
> But that same Ladies hurts no herbe he found,  
> Which could redresse, for it was inwardly vnsound.
>
> Now when as *Calepine* was woxen strong,  
> Vpon a day he cast abrode to wend,  
> To take the ayre, and heare the thrushes song,  
> Vnarm'd, as fearing neither foe nor frend,  
> And without sword his person to defend.  
> There him befell, vnlooked for before,  
> An hard aduenture with vnhappie end;  
> A cruell Beare, the which an infant bore  
> Betwixt his bloodie iawes, besprinckled all with gore.
>
> The litle babe did loudly scrike and squall,  
> And all the woods with piteous plaints did fill,  
> As if his cry did meane for helpe to call  
> To *Calepine*, whose eares those shrieches shrill  
> Percing his hart with pities point did thrill;  
> That after him he ran with zealous haste,  
> To rescue th'infant, ere he did him kill:  
> Whom though he saw now somewhat ouerpast,  
> Yet by the cry he follow'd, and pursewed fast.
>
> Well then him chaunst his heauy armes to want,  
> Whose burden mote empeach his needfull speed,  
> And hinder him from libertie to pant:  
> For hauing long time, as his daily weed,  
> Them wont to weare, and wend on foot for need,  
> Now wanting them he felt himselfe so light,  
> That like an Hauke, which feeling her selfe freed  
> From bels and iesses, which did let her flight,  
> Him seem'd his feet did fly, and in their speed delight.
>
> So well he sped him, that the wearie Beare  
> Ere long he ouertooke, and forst to stay,  
> And without weapon him assayling neare,  
> Compeld him soone the spoyle adowne to lay.  
> Wherewith the beast enrag'd to loose his pray,  
> Vpon him turned, and with greedie force  
> And furie, to be crossed in his way,  
> Gaping full wyde, did thinke without remorse  
> To be aueng'd on him, and to deuoure his corse.
>
> But the bold knight no whit thereat dismayd,  
> But catching vp in hand a ragged stone,  
> Which lay thereby (so fortune him did ayde)  
> Vpon him ran, and thrust it all attone  
> Into his gaping throte, that made him grone  
> And gaspe for breath, that he nigh choked was,  
> Being vnable to digest that bone;  
> Ne could it vpward come, nor downward passe,  
> Ne could he brooke the coldnesse of the stony masse.
>
> Whom when as he thus combred did behold,  
> Stryuing in vaine that nigh his bowels brast,  
> He with him closd, and laying mightie hold  
> Vpon his throte, did gripe his gorge so fast,  
> That wanting breath, him downe to ground he cast;  
> And then oppressing him with vrgent paine,  
> Ere long enforst to breath his vtmost blast,  
> Gnashing his cruell teeth at him in vaine,  
> And threatning his sharpe clawes, now wanting powre to straine.
>
> Then tooke he vp betwixt his armes twaine  
> The litle babe, sweet relickes of his pray;  
> Whom pitying to heare so sore complaine,  
> From his soft eyes the teares he wypt away,  
> And from his face the filth that did it ray,  
> And euery litle limbe he searcht around,  
> And euery part, that vnder sweathbands lay,  
> Least that the beasts sharpe teeth had any wound  
> Made in his tender flesh, but whole them all he found.
>
> So hauing all his bands againe vptyde,  
> He with him thought backe to returne againe:  
> But when he lookt about on euery syde,  
> To weet which way were best to entertaine,  
> To bring him to the place, where he would faine,  
> He could no path nor tract of foot descry,  
> Ne by inquirie learne, nor ghesse by ayme.  
> For nought but woods and forrests farre and nye,  
> That all about did close the compasse of his eye.
>
> Much was he then encombred, ne could tell  
> Which way to take: now West he went a while,  
> Then North; then neither, but as fortune fell.  
> So vp and downe he wandred many a mile,  
> With wearie trauell and vncertaine toile,  
> Yet nought the nearer to his iourneys end;  
> And euermore his louely litle spoile  
> Crying for food, did greatly him offend.  
> So all that day in wandring vainely he did spend.
>
> At last about the setting of the Sunne,  
> Him selfe out of the forest he did wynd,  
> And by good fortune the plaine champion wonne:  
> Where looking all about, where he mote fynd  
> Some place of succour to content his mynd,  
> At length he heard vnder the forrests syde  
> A voice, that seemed of some woman kynd,  
> Which to her selfe lamenting loudly cryde,  
> And oft complayn'd of fate, and Fortune oft defyde.
>
> To whom approching, when as she perceiued  
> A stranger wight in place, her plaint she stayd,  
> As if she doubted to haue bene deceiued,  
> Or loth to let her sorrowes be bewrayd.  
> Whom when as *Calepine* saw so dismayd,  
> He to her drew, and with faire blandishment  
> Her chearing vp, thus gently to her sayd;  
> What be you wofull Dame, which thus lament,  
> And for what cause declare, so mote ye not repent?
>
> To whom she thus, What need me Sir to tell,  
> That which your selfe haue earst ared so right?  
> A wofull dame ye haue me termed well;  
> So much more wofull, as my wofull plight  
> Cannot redressed be by liuing wight.  
> Nathlesse (quoth he) if need doe not you bynd,  
> Doe it disclose, to ease your grieued spright:  
> Oftimes it haps, that sorrowes of the mynd  
> Find remedie vnsought, which seeking cannot fynd.
>
> Then thus began the lamentable Dame;  
> Sith then ye needs will know the griefe I hoord,  
> I am th'vnfortunate *Matilde* by name,  
> The wife of bold Sir *Bruin*, who is Lord  
> Of all this land, late conquer'd by his sword  
> From a great Gyant, called *Cormoraunt*;  
> Whom he did ouerthrow by yonder foord,  
> And in three battailes did so deadly daunt,  
> That he dare not returne for all his daily vaunt.
>
> So is my Lord now seiz'd of all the land,  
> As in his fee, with peaceable estate,  
> And quietly doth hold it in his hand,  
> Ne any dares with him for it debate.  
> But to these happie fortunes, cruell Fate  
> Hath ioyn'd one euill, which doth ouerthrow  
> All these our ioyes, and all our blisse abate;  
> And like in time to further ill to grow,  
> And all this land with endlesse losse to ouerflow.
>
> For th'heauens enuying our prosperitie,  
> Haue not vouchsaft to graunt vnto vs twaine  
> The gladfull blessing of posteritie,  
> Which we might see after our selues remaine  
> In th'heritage of our vnhappie paine:  
> So that for want of heires it to defend,  
> All is in time like to returne againe  
> To that foule feend, who dayly doth attend  
> To leape into the same after our liues end.
>
> But most my Lord is grieued herewithall,  
> And makes exceeding mone, when he does thinke  
> That all this land vnto his foe shall fall,  
> For which he long in vaine did sweat and swinke,  
> That now the same he greatly doth forthinke.  
> Yet was it sayd, there should to him a sonne  
> *Be gotten*, *not begotten*, which should drinke  
> And dry vp all the water, which doth ronne  
> In the next brooke, by whõ that feend shold be fordonne.
>
> Well hop't he then, when this was propheside,  
> That from his sides some noble chyld should rize,  
> The which through fame should farre be magnifide,  
> And this proud gyant should with braue emprize  
> Quite ouerthrow, who now ginnes to despize  
> The good Sir *Bruin*, growing farre in yeares;  
> Who thinkes from me his sorrow all doth rize.  
> Lo this my cause of griefe to you appeares;  
> For which I thus doe mourne, and poure forth ceaselesse teares.
>
> Which when he heard, he inly touched was  
> With tender ruth for her vnworthy griefe:  
> And when he had deuized of her case,  
> He gan in mind conceiue a fit reliefe  
> For all her paine, if please her make the priefe.  
> And hauing cheared her, thus said; faire Dame,  
> In euils counsell is the comfort chiefe,  
> Which though I be not wise enough to frame,  
> Yet as I well it meane, vouchsafe it without blame.
>
> If that the cause of this your languishment  
> Be lacke of children, to supply your place,  
> Lo how good fortune doth to you present  
> This litle babe, of sweete and louely face,  
> And spotlesse spirit, in which ye may enchace  
> What euer formes ye list thereto apply,  
> Being now soft and fit them to embrace;  
> Whether ye list him traine in cheualry,  
> Or noursle vp in lore of learn'd Philosophy.
>
> And certes it hath oftentimes bene seene,  
> That of the like, whose linage was vnknowne,  
> More braue and noble knights haue raysed beene,  
> As their victorious deedes haue often showen,  
> Being with fame through many Nations blowen,  
> Then those, which haue bene dandled in the lap.  
> Therefore some thought, that those braue imps were sowen  
> Here by the Gods, and fed with heauenly sap,  
> That made them grow so high t'all honorable hap.
>
> The Ladie hearkning to his sensefull speach,  
> Found nothing that he said, vnmeet nor geason,  
> Hauing oft seene it tryde, as he did teach.  
> Therefore inclyning to his goodly reason,  
> Agreeing well both with the place and season,  
> She gladly did of that same babe accept,  
> As of her owne by liuerey and seisin,  
> And hauing ouer it a litle wept,  
> She bore it thence, and euer as her owne it kept.
>
> Right glad was *Calepine* to be so rid  
> Of his young charge, whereof he skilled nought:  
> Ne she lesse glad; for she so wisely did,  
> And with her husband vnder hand so wrought,  
> That when that infant vnto him she brought,  
> She made him thinke it surely was his owne,  
> And it in goodly thewes so well vpbrought,  
> That it became a famous knight well knowne,  
> And did right noble deedes, the which elswhere are showne.
>
> But *Calepine*, now being left alone  
> Vnder the greenewoods side in sorie plight,  
> Withouten armes or steede to ride vpon,  
> Or house to hide his head from heauens spight,  
> Albe that Dame by all the meanes she might,  
> Him oft desired home with her to wend,  
> And offred him, his courtesie to requite,  
> Both horse and armes, and what so else to lend,  
> Yet he them all refusd, though thankt her as a frend.
>
> And for exceeding griefe which inly grew,  
> That he his loue so lucklesse now had lost,  
> On the cold ground, maugre himselfe he threw,  
> For fell despight, to be so sorely crost;  
> And there all night himselfe in anguish tost,  
> Vowing, that neuer he in bed againe  
> His limbes would rest, ne lig in ease embost,  
> Till that his Ladies sight he mote attaine,  
> Or vnderstand, that she in safetie did remaine.
