*Cant. VIII.*

> *Prince Arthure and Sir Artegall,  
> Free Samient from feare:  
> They slay the Soudan, driue his wife  
> Adicia to despaire.*

> N Ought vnder heauen so strongly doth allure  
> The sence of man, and all his minde possesse,  
> As beauties louely baite, that doth procure  
> Great warriours oft their rigour to represse,  
> And mighty hands forget their manlinesse;  
> Drawne with the powre of an heart-robbing eye,  
> And wrapt in fetters of a golden tresse,  
> That can with melting pleasaunce mollifye  
> Their hardned hearts, enur'd to bloud and cruelty.
>
> So whylome learnd that mighty Iewish swaine,  
> Each of whose lockes did match a man in might,  
> To lay his spoiles before his lemans traine:  
> So also did that great Oetean Knight  
> For his loues sake his Lions skin vndight:  
> And so did warlike *Antony* neglect  
> The worlds whole rule for *Cleopatras* sight.  
> Such wondrous powre hath wemens faire aspect,  
> To captiue men, and make them all the world reiect.
>
> Yet could it not sterne *Artegall* retaine,  
> Nor hold from suite of his auowed quest,  
> Which he had vndertane to *Gloriane*;  
> But left his loue, albe her strong request,  
> Faire *Britomart* in languor and vnrest,  
> And rode him selfe vppon his first intent:  
> Ne day nor night did euer idly rest;  
> Ne wight but onely *Talus* with him went,  
> The true guide of his way and vertuous gouernment.
>
> So trauelling, he chaunst far off to heed  
> A Damzell, flying on a palfrey fast  
> Before two Knights, that after her did speed  
> With all their powre, and her full fiercely chast  
> In hope to haue her ouerhent at last:  
> Yet fled she fast, and both them farre outwent,  
> Carried with wings of feare, like fowle aghast,  
> With locks all loose, and rayment all to rent;  
> And euer as she rode, her eye was backeward bent.
>
> Soone after these he saw another Knight,  
> That after those two former rode apace,  
> With speare in rest, and prickt with all his might:  
> So ran they all, as they had bene at bace,  
> They being chased, that did others chase.  
> At length he saw the hindmost ouertake  
> One of those two, and force him turne his face;  
> How euer loth he were his way to slake,  
> Yet mote he algates now abide, and answere make.
>
> But th'other still pursu'd the fearefull Mayd;  
> Who still from him as fast away did flie,  
> Ne once for ought her speedy passage stayd,  
> Till that at length she did before her spie  
> Sir *Artegall*, to whom she streight did hie  
> With gladfull hast, in hope of him to get  
> Succour against her greedy enimy:  
> Who seeing her approch gan forward set,  
> To saue her from her feare, and him from force to let.
>
> But he like hound full greedy of his pray,  
> Being impatient of impediment,  
> Continu'd still his course, and by the way  
> Thought with his speare him quight haue ouerwent.  
> So both together ylike felly bent,  
> Like fiercely met. But *Artegall* was stronger,  
> And better skild in Tilt and Turnament,  
> And bore him quite out of his saddle, longer  
> Then two speares length; So mischiefe ouermatcht the wronger.
>
> And in his fall misfortune him mistooke;  
> For on his head vnhappily he pight,  
> That his owne waight his necke asunder broke,  
> And left there dead. Meane while the other Knight  
> Defeated had the other faytour quight,  
> And all his bowels in his body brast:  
> Whom leauing there in that dispiteous plight,  
> He ran still on, thinking to follow fast  
> His other fellow Pagan, which before him past.
>
> In stead of whom finding there ready prest  
> Sir *Artegall*, without discretion  
> He at him ran, with ready speare in rest:  
> Who seeing him come still so fiercely on,  
> Against him made againe. So both anon  
> Together met, and strongly either strooke  
> And broke their speares; yet neither has forgon  
> His horses backe, yet to and fro long shooke,  
> And tottred like two towres, which through a tempest quooke.
>
> But when againe they had recouered sence,  
> They drew their swords, in mind to make amends  
> For what their speares had fayld of their pretence.  
> Which when the Damzell, who those deadly ends  
> Of both her foes had seene, and now her frends  
> For her beginning a more fearefull fray,  
> She to them runnes in hast, and her haire rends,  
> Crying to them their cruell hands to stay,  
> Vntill they both doe heare, what she to them will say.
>
> They stayd their hands, when she thus gan to speake;  
> Ah gentle Knights, what meane ye thus vnwise  
> Vpon your selues anothers wrong to wreake?  
> I am the wrong'd, whom ye did enterprise  
> Both to redresse, and both redrest likewise:  
> Witnesse the Paynims both, whom ye may see  
> There dead on ground. What doe ye then deuise  
> Of more reuenge? if more, then I am shee,  
> Which was the roote of all, end your reuenge on mee.
>
> Whom when they heard so say, they lookt about,  
> To weete if it were true, as she had told;  
> Where when they saw their foes dead out of doubt,  
> Eftsoones they gan their wrothfull hands to hold,  
> And Ventailes reare, each other to behold.  
> Tho when as *Artegall* did *Arthure* vew,  
> So faire a creature, and so wondrous bold,  
> He much admired both his heart and hew,  
> And touched with intire affection, nigh him drew.
>
> Saying, Sir Knight, of pardon I you pray,  
> That all vnweeting haue you wrong'd thus sore,  
> Suffring my hand against my heart to stray:  
> Which if ye please forgiue, I will therefore  
> Yeeld for amends my selfe yours euermore,  
> Or what so penaunce shall by you be red.  
> To whom the Prince; Certes me needeth more  
> To craue the same, whom errour so misled,  
> As that I did mistake the liuing for the ded.
>
> But sith ye please, that both our blames shall die,  
> Amends may for the trespasse soone be made,  
> Since neither is endamadg'd much thereby.  
> So can they both them selues full eath perswade  
> To faire accordaunce, and both faults to shade,  
> Either embracing other louingly,  
> And swearing faith to either on his blade,  
> Neuer thenceforth to nourish enmity,  
> But either others cause to maintaine mutually.
>
> Then *Artegall* gan of the Prince enquire,  
> What were those knights, which there on grouũd were layd,  
> And had receiu'd their follies worthy hire,  
> And for what cause they chased so that Mayd.  
> Certes I wote not well (the Prince then sayd)  
> But by aduenture found them faring so,  
> As by the way vnweetingly I strayd,  
> And lo the Damzell selfe, whence all did grow,  
> Of whom we may at will the whole occasion know.
>
> Then they that Damzell called to them nie,  
> And asked her, what were those two her fone,  
> From whom she earst so fast away did flie;  
> And what was she her selfe so woe begone,  
> And for what cause pursu'd of them attone.  
> To whom she thus; Then wote ye well, that I  
> Doe serue a Queene, that not far hence doth wone,  
> A Princesse of great powre and maiestie,  
> Famous through all the world, and honor'd far and nie.
>
> Her name *Mercilla* most men vse to call;  
> That is a mayden Queene of high renowne,  
> For her great bounty knowen ouer all,  
> And soueraine grace, with which her royall crowne  
> She doth support, and strongly beateth downe  
> The malice of her foes, which her enuy,  
> And at her happinesse do fret and frowne:  
> Yet she her selfe the more doth magnify,  
> And euen to her foes her mercies multiply.
>
> Mongst many which maligne her happy state,  
> There is a mighty man, which wonnes here by  
> That with most fell despight and deadly hate,  
> Seekes to subuert her Crowne and dignity,  
> And all his powre doth thereunto apply:  
> And her good Knights, of which so braue a band  
> Serues her, as any Princesse vnder sky,  
> He either spoiles, if they against him stand,  
> Or to his part allures, and bribeth vnder hand.
>
> Ne him sufficeth all the wrong and ill,  
> Which he vnto her people does each day,  
> But that he seekes by traytrous traines to spill  
> Her person, and her sacred selfe to slay:  
> That O ye heauens defend, and turne away  
> From her, vnto the miscreant him selfe,  
> That neither hath religion nor fay,  
> But makes his God of his vngodly pelfe,  
> And Idols serues; so let his Idols serue the Elfe.
>
> To all which cruell tyranny they say,  
> He is prouokt, and stird vp day and night  
> By his bad wife, that hight *Adicia*,  
> Who counsels him through confidence of might,  
> To breake all bonds of law, and rules of right.  
> For she her selfe professeth mortall foe  
> To Iustice, and against her still doth fight,  
> Working to all, that loue her, deadly woe,  
> And making all her Knights and people to doe so.
>
> Which my liege Lady seeing, thought it best,  
> With that his wife in friendly wise to deale,  
> For stint of strife, and stablishment of rest  
> Both to her selfe, and to her commonweale,  
> And all forepast displeasures to repeale.  
> So me in message vnto her she sent,  
> To treat with her by way of enterdeale,  
> Of finall peace and faire attonement,  
> Which might concluded be by mutuall consent.
>
> All times haue wont safe passage to afford  
> To messengers, that come for causes iust:  
> But this proude Dame disdayning all accord,  
> Not onely into bitter termes forth brust,  
> Reuiling me, and rayling as she lust,  
> But lastly to make proofe of vtmost shame,  
> Me like a dog she out of dores did thrust,  
> Miscalling me by many a bitter name,  
> That neuer did her ill, ne once deserued blame.
>
> And lastly, that no shame might wanting be,  
> When I was gone, soone after me she sent  
> These two false Knights, whom there ye lying see,  
> To be by them dishonoured and shent:  
> But thankt be God, and your good hardiment,  
> They haue the price of their owne folly payd.  
> So said this Damzell, that hight *Samient*,  
> And to those knights, for their so noble ayd,  
> Her selfe most gratefull shew'd, & heaped thanks repayd.
>
> But they now hauing throughly heard, and seene  
> Al those great wrongs, the which that mayd complained  
> To haue bene done against her Lady Queene,  
> By that proud dame, which her so much disdained,  
> Were moued much thereat, and twixt them fained,  
> With all their force to worke auengement strong  
> Vppon the Souldan selfe, which it mayntained,  
> And on his Lady, th'author of that wrong,  
> And vppon all those Knights, that did to her belong.
>
> But thinking best by counterfet disguise  
> To their deseigne to make the easier way,  
> They did this complot twixt them selues deuise,  
> First, that sir *Artegall* should him array,  
> Like one of those two Knights, which dead there lay.  
> And then that Damzell, the sad *Samient*,  
> Should as his purchast prize with him conuay  
> Vnto the Souldans court, her to present  
> Vnto his scornefull Lady, that for her had sent.
>
> So as they had deuiz'd, sir *Artegall*  
> Him clad in th'armour of a Pagan knight,  
> And taking with him, as his vanquisht thrall,  
> That Damzell, led her to the Souldans right.  
> Where soone as his proud wife of her had sight,  
> Forth of her window as she looking lay,  
> She weened streight, it was her Paynim Knight,  
> Which brought that Damzell, as his purchast pray;  
> And sent to him a Page, that mote direct his way.
>
> Who bringing them to their appointed place,  
> Offred his seruice to disarme the Knight;  
> But he refusing him to let vnlace,  
> For doubt to be discouered by his sight,  
> Kept himselfe still in his straunge armour dight.  
> Soone after whom the Prince arriued there,  
> And sending to the Souldan in despight  
> A bold defyance, did of him requere  
> That Damzell, whom he held as wrongfull prisonere.
>
> Wherewith the Souldan all with furie fraught,  
> Swearing, and banning most blasphemously,  
> Commaunded straight his armour to be brought,  
> And mounting straight vpon a charret hye,  
> With yron wheeles and hookes arm'd dreadfully,  
> And drawne of cruell steedes, which he had fed  
> With flesh of men, whom through fell tyranny  
> He slaughtred had, and ere they were halfe ded,  
> Their bodies to his beasts for prouender did spred.
>
> So forth he came all in a cote of plate,  
> Burnisht with bloudie rust, whiles on the greene  
> The Briton Prince him readie did awayte,  
> In glistering armes right goodly well beseene,  
> That shone as bright, as doth the heauen sheene;  
> And by his stirrup *Talus* did attend,  
> Playing his pages part, as he had beene  
> Before directed by his Lord; to th'end  
> He should his flale to finall execution bend.
>
> Thus goe they both together to their geare,  
> With like fierce minds, but meanings different:  
> For the proud Souldan with presumpteous cheare,  
> And countenance sublime and insolent,  
> Sought onely slaughter and auengement:  
> But the braue Prince for honour and for right,  
> Gainst tortious powre and lawlesse regiment,  
> In the behalfe of wronged weake did fight:  
> More in his causes truth he trusted then in might.
>
> Like to the *Thracian* Tyrant, who they say  
> Vnto his horses gaue his guests for meat,  
> Till he himselfe was made their greedie pray,  
> And torne in peeces by *Alcides* great.  
> So thought the Souldan in his follies threat,  
> Either the Prince in peeces to haue torne  
> With his sharpe wheeles, in his first rages heat,  
> Or vnder his fierce horses feet haue borne  
> And trampled downe in dust his thoughts disdained scorne.
>
> But the bold child that perill well espying,  
> If he too rashly to his charet drew,  
> Gaue way vnto his horses speedie flying,  
> And their resistlesse rigour did eschew.  
> Yet as he passed by, the Pagan threw  
> A shiuering dart with so impetuous force,  
> That had he not it shun'd with heedfull vew,  
> It had himselfe transfixed, or his horse,  
> Or made them both one masse withouten more remorse.
>
> Oft drew the Prince vnto his charret nigh,  
> In hope some stroke to fasten on him neare;  
> But he was mounted in his seat so high,  
> And his wingfooted coursers him did beare  
> So fast away, that ere his readie speare  
> He could aduance, he farre was gone and past.  
> Yet still he him did follow euerywhere,  
> And followed was of him likewise full fast;  
> So long as in his steedes the flaming breath did last.
>
> Againe the Pagan threw another dart,  
> Of which he had with him abundant store,  
> On euery side of his embatteld cart,  
> And of all other weapons lesse or more,  
> Which warlike vses had deuiz'd of yore.  
> The wicked shaft guyded through th'ayrie wyde,  
> By some bad spirit, that it to mischiefe bore,  
> Stayd not, till through his curat it did glyde,  
> And made a griesly wound in his enriuen side.
>
> Much was he grieued with that haplesse throe,  
> That opened had the welspring of his blood;  
> But much the more that to his hatefull foe  
> He mote not come, to wreake his wrathfull mood.  
> That made him raue, like to a Lyon wood,  
> Which being wounded of the huntsmans hand  
> Can not come neare him in the couert wood,  
> Where he with boughes hath built his shady stand,  
> And fenst himselfe about with many a flaming brand.
>
> Still when he sought t'approch vnto him ny,  
> His charret wheeles about him whirled round,  
> And made him backe againe as fast to fly;  
> And eke his steedes like to an hungry hound,  
> That hunting after game hath carrion found,  
> So cruelly did him pursew and chace,  
> That his good steed, all were he much renound  
> For noble courage, and for hardie race,  
> Durst not endure their sight, but fled from place to place.
>
> Thus long they trast, and trauerst to and fro,  
> Seeking by euery way to make some breach,  
> Yet could the Prince not nigh vnto him goe,  
> That one sure stroke he might vnto him reach,  
> Whereby his strengthes assay he might him teach.  
> At last from his victorious shield he drew  
> The vaile, which did his powrefull light empeach;  
> And comming full before his horses vew,  
> As they vpon him prest, it plaine to them did shew.
>
> Like lightening flash, that hath the gazer burned,  
> So did the sight thereof their sense dismay,  
> That backe againe vpon themselues they turned,  
> And with their ryder ranne perforce away:  
> Ne could the Souldan them from flying stay,  
> With raynes, or wonted rule, as well he knew.  
> Nought feared they, what he could do, or say,  
> But th'onely feare, that was before their vew;  
> From which like mazed deare, dismayfully they flew.
>
> Fast did they fly, as them their feete could beare,  
> High ouer hilles, and lowly ouer dales,  
> As they were follow'd of their former feare.  
> In vaine the Pagan bannes, and sweares, and rayles,  
> And backe with both his hands vnto him hayles  
> The resty raynes, regarded now no more:  
> He to them calles and speakes, yet nought auayles;  
> They heare him not, they haue forgot his lore,  
> But go, which way they list, their guide they haue forlore.
>
> As when the firie-mouthed steeds, which drew  
> The Sunnes bright wayne to *Phaetons* decay,  
> Soone as they did the monstrous Scorpion vew,  
> With vgly craples crawling in their way,  
> The dreadfull sight did them so sore affray,  
> That their well knowen courses they forwent,  
> And leading th'euer-burning lampe astray,  
> This lower world nigh all to ashes brent,  
> And left their scorched path yet in the firmament.
>
> Such was the furie of these head-strong steeds,  
> Soone as the infants sunlike shield they saw,  
> That all obedience both to words and deeds  
> They quite forgot, and scornd all former law;  
> Through woods, and rocks, and mountaines they did draw  
> The yron charet, and the wheeles did teare,  
> And tost the Paynim, without feare or awe;  
> From side to side they tost him here and there,  
> Crying to them in vaine, that nould his crying heare.
>
> Yet still the Prince pursew'd him close behind,  
> Oft making offer him to smite, but found  
> No easie meanes according to his mind.  
> At last they haue all ouerthrowne to ground  
> Quite topside turuey, and the pagan hound  
> Amongst the yron hookes and graples keene,  
> Torne all to rags, and rent with many a wound,  
> That no whole peece of him was to be seene,  
> But scattred all about, and strow'd vpon the greene.
>
> Like as the cursed sonne of *Theseus*,  
> That following his chace in dewy morne,  
> To fly his stepdames loues outrageous,  
> Of his owne steedes was all to peeces torne,  
> And his faire limbs left in the woods forlorne;  
> That for his sake *Diana* did lament,  
> And all the wooddy Nymphes did wayle and mourne.  
> So was this Souldan rapt and all to rent,  
> That of his shape appear'd no litle moniment.
>
> Onely his shield and armour, which there lay,  
> Though nothing whole, but all to brusd and broken,  
> He vp did take, and with him brought away,  
> That mote remaine for an eternall token  
> To all, mongst whom this storie should be spoken,  
> How worthily, by heauens high decree,  
> Iustice that day of wrong her selfe had wroken,  
> That all men which that spectacle did see,  
> By like ensample mote for euer warned bee.
>
> So on a tree, before the Tyrants dore,  
> He caused them be hung in all mens sight,  
> To be a moniment for euermore.  
> Which when his Ladie from the castles hight  
> Beheld, it much appald her troubled spright:  
> Yet not, as women wont in dolefull fit,  
> She was dismayd, or faynted through affright,  
> But gathered vnto her her troubled wit,  
> And gan eftsoones deuize to be aueng'd for it.
>
> Streight downe she ranne, like an enraged cow,  
> That is berobbed of her youngling dere,  
> With knife in hand, and fatally did vow,  
> To wreake her on that mayden messengere,  
> Whom she had causd be kept as prisonere,  
> By *Artegall*, misween'd for her owne Knight,  
> That brought her backe. And comming present there,  
> She at her ran with all her force and might,  
> All flaming with reuenge and furious despight.
>
> Like raging *Ino*, when with knife in hand  
> She threw her husbands murdred infant out,  
> Or fell *Medea*, when on *Colchicke* strand  
> Her brothers bones she scattered all about;  
> Or as that madding mother, mongst the rout  
> Of *Bacchus* Priests her owne deare flesh did teare.  
> Yet neither *Ino*, nor *Medea* stout,  
> Nor all the *Moenades* so furious were,  
> As this bold woman, when she saw that Damzell there.
>
> But *Artegall* being thereof aware,  
> Did stay her cruell hand, ere she her raught,  
> And as she did her selfe to strike prepare,  
> Out of her fist the wicked weapon caught:  
> With that like one enfelon'd or distraught,  
> She forth did rome, whether her rage her bore,  
> With franticke passion, and with furie fraught;  
> And breaking forth out at a posterne dore,  
> Vnto the wyld wood ranne, her dolours to deplore.
>
> As a mad bytch, when as the franticke fit  
> Her burning tongue with rage inflamed hath,  
> Doth runne at randon, and with furious bit  
> Snatching at euery thing, doth wreake her wrath  
> On man and beast, that commeth in her path.  
> There they doe say, that she transformed was  
> Into a Tygre, and that Tygres scath  
> In crueltie and outrage she did pas,  
> To proue her surname true, that she imposed has.
>
> Then *Artegall* himselfe dicouering plaine,  
> Did issue forth gainst all that warlike rout  
> Of knights and armed men, which did maintaine  
> That Ladies part, and to the Souldan lout:  
> All which he did assault with courage stout,  
> All were they nigh an hundred knights of name:  
> And like wyld Goates them chaced all about,  
> Flying from place to place with cowheard shame,  
> So that with finall force them all he ouercame.
>
> Then caused he the gates be opened wyde,  
> And there the Prince, as victour of that day,  
> With tryumph entertayn'd and glorifyde,  
> Presenting him with all the rich array,  
> And roiall pompe, which there long hidden lay,  
> Purchast through lawlesse powre and tortious wrong  
> Of that proud Souldan, whom he earst did slay.  
> So both for rest there hauing stayd not long,  
> Marcht with that mayd, fit matter for another song.
