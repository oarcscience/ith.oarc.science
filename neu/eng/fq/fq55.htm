<blockquote>
<i>The spousals of faire Florimell,<br>
where turney many knights:<br>
There Braggadochio is vncas'd<br>
in all the Ladies sights.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
A
Fter long stormes and tempests ouerblowne,<br>
The sunne at length his ioyous face doth cleare:<br>
So when as fortune all her spight hath showne,<br>
Some blisfull houres at last must needes appeare;<br>
Else should afflicted wights oftimes despeire.<br>
So comes it now to <i>Florimell</i> by tourne,<br>
After long sorrowes suffered whyleare,<br>
In which captiu'd she many moneths did mourne,<br>
To tast of ioy, and to wont pleasures to retourne.<p>

Who being freed from <i>Proteus</i> cruell band<br>
By <i>Marinell</i>, was vnto him affide,<br>
And by him brought againe to Faerie land;<br>
Where he her spous'd, and made his ioyous bride.<br>
The time and place was blazed farre and wide;<br>
And solemne feasts and giusts ordain'd therefore.<br>
To which there did resort from euery side<br>
Of Lords and Ladies infinite great store;<br>
Ne any Knight was absent, that braue courage bore.<p>

To tell the glorie of the feast that day,<br>
The goodly seruice, the deuicefull sights,<br>
The bridegromes state, the brides most rich array,<br>
The pride of Ladies, and the worth of knights,<br>
The royall banquets, and the rare delights,<br>
Were worke fit for an Herauld, not for me:<br>
But for so much as to my lot here lights,<br>
That with this present treatise doth agree,<br>
True vertue to aduance, shall here recounted bee.<p>

When all men had with full satietie<br>
Of meates and drinkes their appetites suffiz'd,<br>
To deedes of armes and proofe of cheualrie<br>
They gan themselues addresse, full rich aguiz'd,<br>
As each one had his furnitures deuiz'd.<br>
And first of all issu'd Sir <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
And with him sixe knights more, which enterpriz'd<br>
To chalenge all in right of <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
And to maintaine, that she all others did excell.<p>

The first of them was hight Sir <i>Orimont</i>,<br>
A noble Knight, and tride in hard assayes:<br>
The second had to name Sir <i>Bellisont</i>,<br>
But second vnto none in prowesse prayse;<br>
The third was <i>Brunell</i>, famous in his dayes;<br>
The fourth <i>Ecastor</i>, of exceeding might;<br>
The fift <i>Armeddan</i>, skild in louely layes;<br>
The sixt was <i>Lansack</i>, a redoubted Knight:<br>
All sixe well seene in armes, and prou'd in many a fight.<p>

And them against came all that list to giust,<br>
From euery coast and countrie vnder sunne:<br>
None was debard, but all had leaue that lust.<br>
The trompets sound; then all together ronne.<br>
Full many deedes of armes that day were donne,<br>
And many knights vnhorst, and many wounded,<br>
As fortune fell; yet litle lost or wonne:<br>
But all that day the greatest prayse redounded<br>
To <i>Marinell</i>, whose name the Heralds loud resounded.<p>

The second day, so soone as morrow light<br>
Appear'd in heauen, into the field they came,<br>
And there all day continew'd cruell fight,<br>
With diuers fortune fit for such a game,<br>
In which all stroue with perill to winne fame.<br>
Yet whether side was victor, note be ghest:<br>
But at the last the trompets did proclame<br>
That <i>Marinell</i> that day deserued best.<br>
So they disparted were, and all men went to rest.<p>

The third day came, that should due tryall lend<br>
Of all the rest, and then this warlike crew<br>
Together met, of all to make an end.<br>
There <i>Marinell</i> great deeds of armes did shew;<br>
And through the thickest like a Lyon flew,<br>
Rashing off helmes, and ryuing plates a sonder,<br>
That euery one his daunger did eschew.<br>
So terribly his dreadfull strokes did thonder,<br>
That all men stood amaz'd, &amp; at his might did wonder.<p>

But what on earth can alwayes happie stand?<br>
The greater prowesse greater perils find.<br>
So farre he past amongst his enemies band,<br>
That they haue him enclosed so behind,<br>
As by no meanes he can himselfe outwind.<br>
And now perforce they haue him prisoner taken;<br>
And now they doe with captiue bands him bind;<br>
And now they lead him thence, of all forsaken,<br>
Vnlesse some succour had in time him ouertaken.<p>

It fortun'd whylest they were thus ill beset,<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i> into the Tilt-yard came,<br>
With <i>Braggadochio</i>, whom he lately met<br>
Vpon the way, with that his snowy Dame.<br>
Where when he vnderstood by common fame,<br>
What euill hap to <i>Marinell</i> betid,<br>
He much was mou'd at so vnworthie shame,<br>
And streight that boaster prayd, with whom he rid,<br>
To change his shield with him, to be better hid.<p>

So forth he went, and soone them ouer hent,<br>
Where they were leading <i>Marinell</i> away,<br>
Whom he assayld with dreadlesse hardiment,<br>
And forst the burden of their prize to stay.<br>
They were an hundred knights of that array;<br>
Of which th'one halfe vpon himselfe did set,<br>
The other stayd behind to gard the pray.<br>
But he ere long the former fiftie bet;<br>
And from the other fiftie soone the prisoner fet.<p>

So backe he brought Sir <i>Marinell</i> againe;<br>
Whom hauing quickly arm'd againe anew,<br>
They both together ioyned might and maine,<br>
To set afresh on all the other crew.<br>
Whom with sore hauocke soone they ouerthrew,<br>
And chaced quite out of the field, that none<br>
Against them durst his head to perill shew.<br>
So were they left Lords of the field alone:<br>
So <i>Marinell</i> by him was rescu'd from his fone.<p>

Which when he had perform'd, then backe againe<br>
To <i>Braggadochio</i> did his shield restore:<br>
Who all this while behind him did remaine,<br>
Keeping there close with him in pretious store<br>
That his false Ladie, as ye heard afore.<br>
Then did the trompets sound, and Iudges rose,<br>
And all these knights, which that day armour bore,<br>
Came to the open hall, to listen whose<br>
The honour of the prize should be adiudg'd by those.<p>

And thether also came in open sight<br>
Fayre <i>Florimell</i>, into the common hall,<br>
To greet his guerdon vnto euery knight,<br>
And best to him, to whom the best should fall.<br>
Then for that stranger knight they loud did call,<br>
To whom that day they should the girlond yield.<br>
Who came not forth, but for Sir <i>Artegall</i><br>
Came <i>Braggadochio</i>, and did shew his shield,<br>
Which bore the Sunne brode blazed in a golden field.<p>

The sight whereof did all with gladnesse fill:<br>
So vnto him they did addeeme the prise<br>
Of all that Tryumph.  Then the trompets shrill<br>
Don <i>Braggadochios</i> name resounded thrise:<br>
So courage lent a cloke to cowardise.<br>
And then to him came fayrest <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
And goodly gan to greet his braue emprise,<br>
And thousand thankes him yeeld, that had so well<br>
Approu'd that day, that she all others did excell.<p>

To whom the boaster, that all knights did blot,<br>
With proud disdaine did scornefull answere make;<br>
That what he did that day, he did it not<br>
For her, but for his owne deare Ladies sake,<br>
Whom on his perill he did vndertake,<br>
Both her and eke all others to excell:<br>
And further did vncomely speaches crake.<br>
Much did his words the gentle Ladie quell,<br>
And turn'd aside for shame to heare, what he did tell.<p>

Then forth he brought his snowy <i>Florimele</i>,<br>
Whom <i>Trompart</i> had in keeping there beside,<br>
Couered from peoples gazement with a vele.<br>
Whom when discouered they had throughly eide,<br>
With great amazement they were stupefide;<br>
And said, that surely <i>Florimell</i> it was,<br>
Or if it were not <i>Florimell</i> so tride,<br>
That <i>Florimell</i> her selfe she then did pas.<br>
So feeble skill of perfect things the vulgar has.<p>

Which when as <i>Marinell</i> beheld likewise,<br>
He was therewith exceedingly dismayd;<br>
Ne wist he what to thinke, or to deuise,<br>
But like as one, whom feends had made affrayd,<br>
He long astonisht stood, ne ought he sayd,<br>
Ne ought he did, but with fast fixed eies<br>
He gazed still vpon that snowy mayd;<br>
Whom euer as he did the more auize,<br>
The more to be true <i>Florimell</i> he did surmize.<p>

As when two sunnes appeare in the azure skye,<br>
Mounted in <i>Phoebus</i> charet fierie bright,<br>
Both darting forth faire beames to each mans eye,<br>
And both adorn'd with lampes of flaming light,<br>
All that behold so strange prodigious sight,<br>
Not knowing natures worke, nor what to weene,<br>
Are rapt with wonder, and with rare affright.<br>
So stood Sir <i>Marinell</i>, when he had seene<br>
The semblant of this false by his faire beauties Queene.<p>

All which when <i>Artegall</i>, who all this while<br>
Stood in the preasse close couered, well aduewed,<br>
And saw that boasters pride and gracelesse guile,<br>
He could no longer beare, but forth issewed,<br>
And vnto all himselfe there open shewed,<br>
And to the boaster said; Thou losell base,<br>
That hast with borrowed plumes thy selfe endewed,<br>
And others worth with leasings doest deface,<br>
When they are all restor'd, thou shalt rest in disgrace.<p>

That shield, which thou doest beare, was it indeed,<br>
Which this dayes honour sau'd to <i>Marinell</i>;<br>
But not that arme, nor thou the man I reed,<br>
Which didst that seruice vnto <i>Florimell</i>.<br>
For proofe shew forth thy sword, and let it tell,<br>
What strokes, what dreadfull stoure it stird this day:<br>
Or shew the wounds, which vnto thee befell;<br>
Or shew the sweat, with which thou diddest sway<br>
So sharpe a battell, that so many did dismay.<p>

But this the sword, which wrought those cruell stounds,<br>
And this the arme, the which that shield did beare,<br>
And these the signes, (so shewed forth his wounds)<br>
By which that glorie gotten doth appeare.<br>
As for this Ladie, which he sheweth here,<br>
Is not (I wager) <i>Florimell</i> at all;<br>
But some fayre Franion, fit for such a fere,<br>
That by misfortune in his hand did fall.<br>
For proofe whereof, he bad them <i>Florimell</i> forth call.<p>

So forth the noble Ladie was ybrought,<br>
Adorn'd with honor and all comely grace:<br>
Whereto her bashfull shamefastnesse ywrought<br>
A great increase in her faire blushing face;<br>
As roses did with lillies interlace.<br>
For of those words, the which that boaster threw,<br>
She inly yet conceiued great disgrace.<br>
Whom when as all the people such did vew,<br>
They shouted loud, and signes of gladnesse all did shew.<p>

Then did he set her by that snowy one,<br>
Like the true saint beside the image set,<br>
Of both their beauties to make paragone,<br>
And triall, whether should the honor get.<br>
Streight way so soone as both together met,<br>
Th'enchaunted Damzell vanisht into nought:<br>
Her snowy substance melted as with heat,<br>
Ne of that goodly hew remayned ought,<br>
But th'emptie girdle, which about her wast was wrought.<p>

As when the daughter of <i>Thaumantes</i> faire,<br>
Hath in a watry cloud displayed wide<br>
Her goodly bow, which paints the liquid ayre;<br>
That all men wonder at her colours pride;<br>
All suddenly, ere one can looke aside,<br>
The glorious picture vanisheth away,<br>
Ne any token doth thereof abide:<br>
So did this Ladies goodly forme decay,<br>
And into nothing goe, ere one could it bewray.<p>

Which when as all that present were, beheld,<br>
They stricken were with great astonishment,<br>
And their faint harts with senselesse horrour queld,<br>
To see the thing, that seem'd so excellent,<br>
So stolen from their fancies wonderment;<br>
That what of it became, none vnderstood.<br>
And <i>Braggadochio</i> selfe with dreriment<br>
So daunted was in his despeyring mood,<br>
That like a lifelesse corse immoueable he stood.<p>

But <i>Artegall</i> that golden belt vptooke,<br>
The which of all her spoyle was onely left;<br>
Which was not hers, as many it mistooke,<br>
But <i>Florimells</i> owne girdle, from her reft,<br>
While she was flying, like a weary weft,<br>
From that foule monster, which did her compell<br>
To perils great; which he vnbuckling eft,<br>
Presented to the fayrest <i>Florimell</i>;<br>
Who round about her tender wast it fitted well.<p>

Full many Ladies often had assayd,<br>
About their middles that faire belt to knit;<br>
And many a one suppos'd to be a mayd:<br>
Yet it to none of all their loynes would fit,<br>
Till <i>Florimell</i> about her fastned it.<br>
Such power it had, that to no womans wast<br>
By any skill or labour it would sit,<br>
Vnlesse that she were continent and chast,<br>
But it would lose or breake, that many had disgrast.<p>

Whilest thus they busied were bout <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
And boastfull <i>Braggadochio</i> to defame,<br>
Sir <i>Guyon</i> as by fortune then befell,<br>
Forth from the thickest preasse of people came,<br>
His owne good steed, which he had stolne, to clame;<br>
And th'one hand seizing on his golden bit,<br>
With th'other drew his sword: for with the same<br>
He ment the thiefe there deadly to haue smit:<br>
And had he not bene held, he nought had fayld of it.<p>

Thereof great hurly burly moued was<br>
Throughout the hall, for that same warlike horse.<br>
For <i>Braggadochio</i> would not let him pas;<br>
And <i>Guyon</i> would him algates haue perforse,<br>
Or it approue vpon his carrion corse.<br>
Which troublous stirre when <i>Artegall</i> perceiued,<br>
He nigh them drew to stay th'auengers forse,<br>
And gan inquire, how was that steed bereaued,<br>
Whether by might extort, or else by slight deceaued.<p>

Who all that piteous storie, which befell<br>
About that wofull couple, which were slaine,<br>
And their young bloodie babe to him gan tell;<br>
With whom whiles he did in the wood remaine,<br>
His horse purloyned was by subtill traine:<br>
For which he chalenged the thiefe to fight.<br>
But he for nought could him thereto constraine.<br>
For as the death he hated such despight,<br>
And rather had to lose, then trie in armes his right.<p>

Which <i>Artegall</i> well hearing, though no more<br>
By law of armes there neede ones right to trie,<br>
As was the wont of warlike knights of yore,<br>
Then that his foe should him the field denie,<br>
Yet further right by tokens to descrie,<br>
He askt, what priuie tokens he did beare.<br>
If that (said <i>Guyon</i>) may you satisfie,<br>
Within his mouth a blacke spot doth appeare,<br>
Shapt like a horses shoe, who list to seeke it there.<p>

Whereof to make due tryall, one did take<br>
The horse in hand, within his mouth to looke:<br>
But with his heeles so sorely he him strake,<br>
That all his ribs he quite in peeces broke,<br>
That neuer word from that day forth he spoke.<br>
Another that would seeme to haue more wit,<br>
Him by the bright embrodered hedstall tooke:<br>
But by the shoulder him so sore he bit,<br>
That he him maymed quite, and all his shoulder split.<p>

Ne he his mouth would open vnto wight,<br>
Vntill that <i>Guyon</i> selfe vnto him spake,<br>
And called <i>Brigadore</i> (so was he hight)<br>
Whose voice so soone as he did vndertake,<br>
Eftsoones he stood as still as any stake,<br>
And suffred all his secret marke to see:<br>
And when as he him nam'd, for ioy he brake<br>
His bands, and follow'd him with gladfull glee,<br>
And friskt, and flong aloft, and louted low on knee.<p>

Thereby Sir <i>Artegall</i> did plaine areed,<br>
That vnto him the horse belong'd, and sayd;<br>
Lo there Sir <i>Guyon</i>, take to you the steed,<br>
As he with golden saddle is arayd;<br>
And let that losell, plainely now displayd,<br>
Hence fare on foot, till he an horse haue gayned.<br>
But the proud boaster gan his doome vpbrayd,<br>
And him reuil'd, and rated, and disdayned,<br>
That iudgement so vniust against him had ordayned.<p>

Much was the knight incenst with his lewd word,<br>
To haue reuenged that his villeny;<br>
And thrise did lay his hand vpon his sword,<br>
To haue him slaine, or dearely doen aby.<br>
But <i>Guyon</i> did his choler pacify,<br>
Saying, Sir knight, it would dishonour bee<br>
To you, that are our iudge of equity,<br>
To wreake your wrath on such a carle as hee:<br>
It's punishment enough, that all his shame doe see.<p>

So did he mitigate Sir <i>Artegall</i>;<br>
But <i>Talus</i> by the backe the boaster hent,<br>
And drawing him out of the open hall,<br>
Vpon him did inflict this punishment.<br>
First he his beard did shaue, and fowly shent:<br>
Then from him reft his shield, and it renuerst,<br>
And blotted out his armes with falshood blent,<br>
And himselfe baffuld, and his armes vnherst,<br>
And broke his sword in twaine, and all his armour sperst.<p>

The whiles his guilefull groome was fled away:<br>
But vaine it was to thinke from him to flie.<br>
Who ouertaking him did disaray,<br>
And all his face deform'd with infamie,<br>
And out of court him scourged openly.<br>
So ought all faytours, that true knighthood shame,<br>
And armes dishonour with base villanie,<br>
From all braue knights be banisht with defame:<br>
For oft their lewdnes blotteth good deserts with blame.<p>

Now when these counterfeits were thus vncased<br>
Out of the foreside of their forgerie,<br>
And in the sight of all men cleane disgraced,<br>
All gan to iest and gibe full merilie<br>
At the remembrance of their knauerie.<br>
Ladies can laugh at Ladies, Knights at Knights,<br>
To thinke with how great vaunt of brauerie<br>
He them abused, through his subtill slights,<br>
And what a glorious shew he made in all their sights.<p>

There leaue we them in pleasure and repast,<br>
Spending their ioyous dayes and gladfull nights,<br>
And taking vsurie of time forepast,<br>
With all deare delices and rare delights,<br>
Fit for such Ladies and such louely knights:<br>
And turne we here to this faire furrowes end<br>
Our wearie yokes, to gather fresher sprights,<br>
That when as time to <i>Artegall</i> shall tend,<br>
We on his first aduenture may him forward send.<p>
