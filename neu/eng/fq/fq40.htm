<blockquote>
<i>Fayre Britomart saues Amoret,<br>
Duessa discord breedes<br>
Twixt Scudamour and Blandamour:<br>
Their fight and warlike deedes.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>

O
F louers sad calamities of old,<br>
Full many piteous stories doe remaine,<br>
But none more piteous euer was ytold,<br>
Then that of <i>Amorets</i> hart-binding chaine,<br>
And this of <i>Florimels</i> vnworthie paine:<br>
The deare compassion of whose bitter fit<br>
My softened heart so sorely doth constraine,<br>
That I with teares full oft doe pittie it,<br>
And oftentimes doe wish it neuer had bene writ.<p>

For from the time that <i>Scudamour</i> her bought<br>
In perilous fight, she neuer ioyed day,<br>
A perilous fight when he with force her brought<br>
From twentie Knights, that did him all assay:<br>
Yet fairely well he did them all dismay:<br>
And with great glorie both the shield of loue,<br>
And eke the Ladie selfe he brought away,<br>
Whom hauing wedded as did him behoue,<br>
A new vnknowen mischiefe did from him remoue.<p>

For that same vile Enchauntour <i>Busyran</i>,<br>
The very selfe same day that she was wedded,<br>
Amidst the bridale feast, whilest euery man<br>
Surcharg'd with wine, were heedlesse and ill hedded.<br>
All bent to mirth before the bride was bedded,<br>
Brought in that mask of loue which late was showen:<br>
And there the Ladie ill of friends bestedded,<br>
By way of sport, as oft in maskes is knowen,<br>
Conueyed quite away to liuing wight vnknowen.<p>

Seuen moneths he so her kept in bitter smart,<br>
Because his sinfull lust she would not serue,<br>
Vntill such time as noble <i>Britomart</i><br>
Released her, that else was like to sterue,<br>
Through cruell knife that her deare heart did kerue.<br>
And now she is with her vpon the way,<br>
Marching in louely wise, that could deserue<br>
No spot of blame, though spite did oft assay<br>
To blot her with dishonor of so faire a pray.<p>

Yet should it be a pleasant tale, to tell<br>
The diuerse vsage and demeanure daint,<br>
That each to other made, as oft befell.<br>
For <i>Amoret</i> right fearefull was and faint,<br>
Lest she with blame her honor should attaint,<br>
That euerie word did tremble as she spake,<br>
And euerie looke was coy, and wondrous quaint,<br>
And euerie limbe that touched her did quake:<br>
Yet could she not but curteous co&#361;tenance to her make.<p>

For well she wist, as true it was indeed,<br>
That her liues Lord and patrone of her health<br>
Right well deserued as his duefull meed,<br>
Her loue, her seruice, and her vtmost wealth.<br>
All is his iustly, that all freely dealth:<br>
Nathlesse her honor dearer then her life,<br>
She sought to saue, as thing reseru'd from stealth;<br>
Die had she leuer with Enchanters knife,<br>
Then to be false in loue, profest a virgine wife.<p>

Thereto her feare was made so much the greater<br>
Through fine abusion of that Briton mayd:<br>
Who for to hide her fained sex the better,<br>
And maske her wounded mind, both did and sayd<br>
Full many things so doubtfull to be wayd,<br>
That well she wist not what by them to gesse,<br>
For other whiles to her she purpos made<br>
Of loue, and otherwhiles of lustfulnesse<br>
That much she feard his mind would grow to some excesse.<p>

His will she feard; for him she surely thought<br>
To be a man, such as indeed he seemed,<br>
And much the more, by that he lately wrought,<br>
When her from deadly thraldome he redeemed,<br>
For which no seruice she too much esteemed,<br>
Yet dread of shame, and doubt of fowle dishonor<br>
Made her not yeeld so much, as due she deemed.<br>
Yet <i>Britomart</i> attended duly on her,<br>
As well became a knight, and did to her all honor.<p>

It so befell one euening, that they came<br>
Vnto a Castell, lodged there to bee,<br>
Where many a knight, and many a louely Dame<br>
Was then assembled, deeds of armes to see:<br>
Amongst all which was none more faire then shee,<br>
That many of them mou'd to eye her sore.<br>
The custome of that place was such, that hee<br>
Which had no loue nor lemman there in store,<br>
Should either winne him one, or lye without the dore.<p>

Amongst the rest there was a iolly knight,<br>
Who being asked for his loue, auow'd<br>
That fairest <i>Amoret</i> was his by right,<br>
And offred that to iustifie alowd.<br>
The warlike virgine seeing his so prowd<br>
And boastfull chalenge, wexed inlie wroth,<br>
But for the present did her anger shrowd;<br>
And sayd, her loue to lose she was full loth,<br>
But either he should neither of them haue, or both.<p>

So foorth they went, and both together giusted;<br>
But that same younker soone was ouer throwne,<br>
And made repent, that he had rashly lusted<br>
For thing vnlawfull, that was not his owne:<br>
Yet since he seemed valiant, through vnknowne,<br>
She that no lesse was courteous then stout,<br>
Cast how to salue, that both the custome showne<br>
Were kept, and yet that Knight not locked out:<br>
That seem'd full hard t'accord two things so far in dout.<p>

The Seneschall was cal'd to deeme the right,<br>
Whom she requir'd, that first fayre <i>Amoret</i><br>
Might be to her allow'd, as to a Knight,<br>
That did her win and free from chalenge set:<br>
Which straight to her was yeelded without let.<br>
Then since that strange Knights loue from him was quitted,<br>
She claim'd that to her selfe, as Ladies det,<br>
He as a Knight might iustly be admitted;<br>
So none should be out shut, sith all of loues were fitted.<p>

With that her glistring helmet she vnlaced;<br>
Which doft, her golden lockes, that were vp bound<br>
Still in a knot, vnto her heeles downe traced,<br>
And like a silken veile in compasse round<br>
About her backe and all her bodie wound;<br>
Like as the shining skie in summers night,<br>
What time the dayes with scorching heat abound,<br>
Is creasted all with lines of firie light,<br>
That it prodigious seemes in common peoples sight.<p>

Such when those Knights and Ladies all about<br>
Beheld her, all were with amazement smit,<br>
And euery one gan grow in secret dout<br>
Of this and that, according to each wit:<br>
Some thought that some enchantment faygned it;<br>
Some, that <i>Bellona</i> in that warlike wise<br>
To them appear'd, with shield and armour fit;<br>
Some, that it was a maske of strange disguise:<br>
So diuersely each one did sundrie doubts deuise.<p>

But that young Knight, which through her gentle deed<br>
Was to that goodly fellowship restor'd,<br>
Ten thousand thankes did yeeld her for her meed,<br>
And doubly ouercommen, her ador'd:<br>
So did they all their former strife accord;<br>
And eke fayre <i>Amoret</i> now freed from feare,<br>
More franke affection did to her afford,<br>
And to her bed, which she was wont forbeare,<br>
Now freely drew, and found right safe assurance theare.<p>

Where all that night they of their loues did treat,<br>
And hard aduentures twixt themselues alone,<br>
That each the other gan with passion great,<br>
And griefull pittie priuately bemone.<br>
The morow next so soone as <i>Titan</i> shone,<br>
They both vprose, and to their waies them dight:<br>
Long wandred they, yet neuer met with none,<br>
That to their willes could them direct aright,<br>
Or to them tydings tell, that mote their harts delight.<p>

Lo thus they rode, till at the last they spide<br>
Two armed Knights, that toward them did pace,<br>
And ech of them had ryding by his side<br>
A Ladie, seeming in so farre a space,<br>
But Ladies none they were, albee in face<br>
And outward shew faire semblance they did beare;<br>
For vnder maske of beautie and good grace,<br>
Vile treason and fowle falshood hidden were,<br>
That mote to none but to the warie wise appeare.<p>

The one of them the false <i>Duessa</i> hight,<br>
That now had chang'd her former wonted hew:<br>
For she could d'on so manie shapes in sight,<br>
As euer could Cameleon colours new;<br>
So could she forge all colours, saue the trew.<br>
The other no whit better was then shee,<br>
But that such as she was, she plaine did shew;<br>
Yet otherwise much worse, if worse might bee,<br>
And dayly more offensiue vnto each degree.<p>

Her name was <i>Ate</i>, mother of debate,<br>
And all dissention, which doth dayly grow<br>
Amongst fraile men, that many a publike state<br>
And many a priuate oft doth ouerthrow.<br>
Her false <i>Duessa</i> who full well did know,<br>
To be most fit to trouble noble knights,<br>
Which hunt for honor, raised from below,<br>
Out of the dwellings of the damned sprights,<br>
Where she in darknes wastes her cursed daies &amp; nights.<p>

Hard by the gates of hell her dwelling is,<br>
There whereas all the plagues and harmes abound,<br>
Which punish wicked men, that walke amisse:<br>
It is a darksome delue farre vnder ground,<br>
With thornes and barren brakes enuirond round,<br>
That none the same may easily out win;<br>
Yet many waies to enter may be found,<br>
But none to issue forth when one is in:<br>
For discord harder is to end then to begin.<p>

And all within the riuen walls were hung<br>
With ragged monuments of times forepast,<br>
All which the sad effects of discord sung:<br>
There were rent robes, and broken scepters plast,<br>
Altars defyl'd, and holy things defast,<br>
Disshiuered speares, and shields ytorne in twaine,<br>
Great cities ransackt, and strong castles rast,<br>
Nations captiued, and huge armies slaine:<br>
Of all which ruines there some relicks did remaine.<p>

There was the signe of antique Babylon,<br>
Of fatall Thebes, of Rome that raigned long,<br>
Of sacred Salem, and sad Ilion<br>
For memorie of which on high there hong<br>
The golden Apple, cause of all their wrong,<br>
For which the three faire Goddesses did striue:<br>
There also was the name of <i>Nimrod</i> strong,<br>
Of <i>Alexander</i>, and his Princes fiue,<br>
Which shar'd to them the spoiles that he had got aliue.<p>

And there the relicks of the drunken fray,<br>
The which amongst the <i>Lapithees</i> befell,<br>
And of the bloodie feast, which sent away<br>
So many <i>Centaures</i> drunken soules to hell,<br>
That vnder great <i>Alcides</i> furie fell:<br>
And of the dreadfull discord, which did driue<br>
The noble <i>Argonauts</i> to outrage fell:<br>
That each of life sought others to depriue,<br>
All mindlesse of the Golden fleece, which made them striue.<p>

And eke of priuate persons many moe,<br>
That were too long a worke to count them all;<br>
Some of sworne friends, that did their faith forgoe;<br>
Some of borne brethren, prov'd vnnaturall;<br>
Some of deare louers, foes perpetuall:<br>
Witnesse their broken bandes there to be seene,<br>
Their girlonds rent, their bowres despoyled all;<br>
The moniments whereof there byding beene,<br>
As plaine as at the first, when they were fresh and greene.<p>

Such was her house within; but all without,<br>
The barren ground was full of wicked weedes,<br>
Which she her selfe had sowen all about,<br>
Now growen great, at first of little seedes,<br>
The seedes of euill wordes, and factious deedes;<br>
Which when to ripenesse due they growen arre,<br>
Bring foorth an infinite increase, that breedes<br>
Tumultuous trouble and contentious iarre,<br>
The which most often end in bloudshed and in warre.<p>

And those same cursed seedes doe also serue<br>
To her for bread, and yeeld her liuing food:<br>
For life it is to her, when others sterue<br>
Through mischieuous debate, and deadly feood,<br>
That she may sucke their life, and drinke their blood,<br>
With which she from her childhood had bene fed.<br>
For she at first was borne of hellish brood,<br>
And by infernall furies nourished,<br>
That by her monstrous shape might easily be red.<p>

Her face most fowle and filthy was to see,<br>
With squinted eyes contrarie wayes intended,<br>
And loathly mouth, vnmeete a mouth to bee,<br>
That nought but gall and venim comprehended,<br>
And wicked wordes that God and man offended:<br>
Her lying tongue was in two parts diuided,<br>
And both the parts did speake, and both contended;<br>
And as her tongue, so was her hart discided,<br>
That neuer thoght one thing, but doubly stil was guided.<p>

Als as she double spake, so heard she double,<br>
With matchlesse eares deformed and distort,<br>
Fild with false rumors and seditious trouble,<br>
Bred in assemblies of the vulgar sort,<br>
That still are led with euery light report.<br>
And as her eares so eke her feet were odde,<br>
And much vnlike, th'one long, the other short,<br>
And both misplast; that when th'one forward yode,<br>
The other backe retired, and contrarie trode.<p>

Likewise vnequall were her handes twaine,<br>
That one did reach, the other pusht away,<br>
That one did make, the other mard againe,<br>
And sought to bring all things vnto decay;<br>
Whereby great riches gathered manie a day,<br>
She in short space did often bring to nought<br>
And their possessours often did dismay.<br>
For all her studie was and all her thought,<br>
How she might ouerthrow the things that Concord wrought.<p>

So much her malice did her might surpas,<br>
That euen th'Almightie selfe she did maligne,<br>
Because to man so mercifull he was,<br>
And vnto all his creatures so benigne,<br>
Sith she her selfe was of his grace indigne:<br>
For all this worlds faire workmanship she tride,<br>
Vnto his last confusion to bring,<br>
And that great golden chaine quite to diuide,<br>
With which it blessed Concord hath together tide.<p>

Such was that hag, which with <i>Duessa</i> roade,<br>
And seruing her in her malitious vse,<br>
To hurt good knights, was as it were her baude,<br>
To sell her borrowed beautie to abuse.<br>
For though like withered tree, that wanteth iuyce,<br>
She old and crooked were, yet now of late,<br>
As fresh and fragrant as the floure deluce<br>
She was become, by chaunge of her estate,<br>
And made full goodly ioyance to her new found mate.<p>

Her mate he was a iollie youthfull knight,<br>
That bore great sway in armes and chiualrie,<br>
And was indeed a man of mickle might:<br>
His name was <i>Blandamour</i>, that did descrie<br>
His fickle mind full of inconstancie.<br>
And now himselfe he fitted had right well,<br>
With two companions of like qualitie,<br>
Faithlesse <i>Duessa</i>, and false <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
That whether were more false, full hard it is to tell.<p>

Now when this gallant with his goodly crew,<br>
From farre espide the famous <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
Like knight aduenturous in outward vew,<br>
With his faire paragon, his conquests part,<br>
Approching nigh, eftsoones his wanton hart<br>
Was tickled with delight, and iesting sayd;<br>
Lo there Sir <i>Paridel</i>, for your desart,<br>
Good lucke presents you with yond louely mayd,<br>
For pitie that ye want a fellow for your ayd.<p>

By that the louely paire drew nigh to hond:<br>
Whom when as <i>Paridel</i> more plaine beheld,<br>
Albee in heart he like affection fond,<br>
Yet mindfull how he late by one was feld,<br>
That did those armes and that same scutchion weld,<br>
He had small lust to buy his loue so deare,<br>
But answerd, Sir him wise I neuer held,<br>
That hauing once escaped perill neare,<br>
Would afterwards afresh the sleeping euill reare.<p>

This knight too late his manhood and his might,<br>
I did assay, that me right dearely cost,<br>
Ne list I for reuenge prouoke new fight,<br>
Ne for light Ladies loue, that soone is lost.<br>
The hot-spurre youth so scorning to be crost,<br>
Take then to you this Dame of mine (quoth hee)<br>
And I without your perill or your cost,<br>
Will chalenge yond same other for my fee:<br>
So forth he fiercely prickt, that one him scarce could see.<p>

The warlike Britonesse her soone addrest,<br>
And with such vncouth welcome did receaue<br>
Her fayned Paramour, her forced guest,<br>
That being forst his saddle soone to leaue,<br>
Him selfe he did of his new loue deceaue:<br>
And made him selfe thensample of his follie.<br>
Which done, she passed forth not taking leaue,<br>
And left him now as sad, as whilome iollie,<br>
Well warned to beware with whom he dar'd to dallie.<p>

Which when his other companie beheld,<br>
They to his succour ran with readie ayd:<br>
And finding him vnable once to weld,<br>
They reared him on horsebacke, and vpstayd,<br>
Till on his way they had him forth conuayd:<br>
And all the way with wondrous griefe of mynd,<br>
And shame, he shewd him selfe to be dismayd,<br>
More for the loue which he had left behynd,<br>
Then that which he had to Sir <i>Paridel</i> resynd.<p>

Nathlesse he forth did march well as he might,<br>
And made good semblance to his companie,<br>
Dissembling his disease and euill plight;<br>
Till that ere long they chaunced to espie<br>
Two other knights, that towards them did ply<br>
With speedie course, as bent to charge them new.<br>
Whom when as <i>Blandamour</i> approching nie,<br>
Perceiu'd to be such as they seemd in vew,<br>
He was full wo, and gan his former griefe renew.<p>

For th'one of them he perfectly descride,<br>
To be Sir <i>Scudamour</i>, by that he bore<br>
The God of loue, with wings displayed wide,<br>
Whom mortally he hated euermore,<br>
Both for his worth, that all men did adore,<br>
And eke because his loue he wonne by right:<br>
Which when he thought, it grieued him full sore,<br>
That through the bruses of his former fight,<br>
He now vnable was to wreake his old despight.<p>

For thy, he thus to <i>Paridel</i> bespake,<br>
Faire Sir, of friendship let me now you pray,<br>
That as I late aduentured for your sake,<br>
The hurts whereof me now from battell stay,<br>
Ye will me now with like good turne repay,<br>
And iustifie my cause on yonder knight.<br>
Ah Sir (said <i>Paridel</i>) do not dismay<br>
Your selfe for this, my selfe will for you fight,<br>
As ye haue done for me: the left hand rubs the right.<p>

With that he put his spurres vnto his steed,<br>
With speare in rest, and toward him did fare,<br>
Like shaft out of a bow preuenting speed.<br>
But <i>Scudamour</i> was shortly well aware<br>
Of his approch, and gan him selfe prepare<br>
Him to receiue with entertainment meete.<br>
So furiously they met, that either bare<br>
The other downe vnder their horses feete,<br>
That what of them became, themselues did scarsly weete.<p>

As when two billowes in the Irish sowndes,<br>
Forcibly driuen with contrarie tydes<br>
Do meete together, each abacke rebowndes<br>
With roaring rage; and dashing on all sides,<br>
That filleth all the sea with fome, diuydes<br>
The doubtfull current into diuers wayes:<br>
So fell those two in spight of both their prydes,<br>
But <i>Scudamour</i> himselfe did soone vprayse,<br>
And mounting light his foe for lying long vpbrayes.<p>

Who rolled on an heape lay still in swound,<br>
All carelesse of his taunt and bitter rayle,<br>
Till that the rest him seeing lie on ground,<br>
Ran hastily, to weete what did him ayle.<br>
Where finding that the breath gan him to fayle,<br>
With busie care they stroue him to awake,<br>
And doft his helmet, and vndid his mayle:<br>
So much they did, that at the last they brake<br>
His slomber, yet so mazed, that he nothing spake.<p>

Which when as <i>Blandamour</i> beheld, he sayd,<br>
False faitour <i>Scudamour</i>, that hast by slight<br>
And foule aduantage this good Knight dismayd,<br>
A Knight much better then thy selfe behight,<br>
Well falles it thee that I am not in plight<br>
This day, to wreake the dammage by thee donne:<br>
Such is thy wont, that still when any Knight<br>
Is weakned, then thou doest him ouerronne:<br>
So hast thou to thy selfe false honour often wonne.<p>

He little answer'd, but in manly heart<br>
His mightie indignation did forbeare,<br>
Which was not yet so secret, but some part<br>
Thereof did in his frouning face appeare:<br>
Like as a gloomie cloud, the which doth beare<br>
An hideous storme, is by the Northerne blast<br>
Quite ouerblowne, yet doth not passe so cleare,<br>
But that it all the skie doth ouercast<br>
With darknes dred, and threatens all the world to wast.<p>

Ah gentle knight then false <i>Duessa</i> sayd,<br>
Why do ye striue for Ladies loue so sore,<br>
Whose chiefe desire is loue and friendly aid<br>
Mongst gentle Knights to nourish euermore?<br>
Ne be ye wroth Sir <i>Scudamour</i> therefore,<br>
That she your loue list loue another knight,<br>
Ne do your selfe dislike a whit the more;<br>
For Loue is free, and led with selfe delight,<br>
Ne will enforced be with maisterdome or might.<p>

So false <i>Duessa</i>, but vile <i>Ate</i> thus;<br>
Both foolish knights, I can but laugh at both,<br>
That striue and storme with stirre outrageous,<br>
For her that each of you alike doth loth,<br>
And loues another, with whom now she go'th<br>
In louely wise, and sleepes, and sports, and playes;<br>
Whilest both you here with many a cursed oth,<br>
Sweare she is yours, and stirre vp bloudie frayes,<br>
To win a willow bough, whilest other weares the bayes.<p>

Vile hag (sayd <i>Scudamour</i>) why dost thou lye?<br>
And falsly seekst a vertuous wight to shame?<br>
Fond knight (sayd she) the thing that with this eye<br>
I saw, why should I doubt to tell the same?<br>
Then tell (quoth <i>Blandamour</i>) and feare no blame,<br>
Tell what thou saw'st, maulgre who so it heares.<br>
I saw (quoth she) a stranger knight, whose name<br>
I wote not well, but in his shield he beares<br>
(That well I wote) the heads of many broken speares.<p>

I saw him haue your <i>Amoret</i> at will,<br>
I saw him kisse, I saw him her embrace,<br>
I saw him sleepe with her all night his fill,<br>
All manie nights, and manie by in place,<br>
That present were to testifie the case.<br>
Which when as <i>Scudamour</i> did heare, his heart<br>
Was thrild with inward griefe, as when in chace<br>
The Parthian strikes a stag with shiuering dart,<br>
The beast astonisht stands in middest of his smart.<p>

So stood Sir <i>Scudamour</i>, when this he heard,<br>
Ne word he had to speake for great dismay,<br>
But lookt on <i>Glauce</i> grim, who woxe afeard<br>
Of outrage for the words, which she heard say,<br>
Albee vntrue she wist them by assay.<br>
But <i>Blandamour</i>, whenas he did espie<br>
His chaunge of cheere, that anguish did bewray,<br>
He woxe full blithe, as he had got thereby,<br>
And gan thereat to triumph without victorie.<p>

Lo recreant (sayd he) the fruitlesse end<br>
Of thy vaine boast, and spoile of loue misgotten,<br>
Whereby the name of knighthood thou dost shend,<br>
And all true louers with dishonor blotten,<br>
All things not rooted well, will soone be rotten.<br>
Fy fy false knight (then false <i>Duessa</i> cryde)<br>
Vnworthy life that loue with guile hast gotten,<br>
Be thou, where euer thou do go or ryde,<br>
Loathed of ladies all, and of all knights defyde.<p>

But <i>Scudamour</i> for passing great despight<br>
Staid not to answer, scarcely did refraine,<br>
But that in all those knights and ladies sight,<br>
He for reuenge had guiltlesse <i>Glauce</i> slaine:<br>
But being past, he thus began amaine;<br>
False traitour squire, false squire, of falsest knight,<br>
Why doth mine hand from thine auenge abstaine,<br>
Whose Lord hath done my loue this foule despight?<br>
Why do I not it wreake, on thee now in my might?<p>

Discourteous, disloyall <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
Vntrue to God, and vnto man vniust,<br>
What vengeance due can equall thy desart,<br>
That hast with shamefull spot of sinfull lust<br>
Defil'd the pledge committed to thy trust?<br>
Let vgly shame and endlesse infamy<br>
Colour thy name with foule reproaches rust.<br>
Yet thou false Squire his fault shalt deare aby,<br>
And with thy punishment his penance shalt supply.<p>

The aged Dame him seeing so enraged,<br>
Was dead with feare, nathlesse as neede required,<br>
His flaming furie sought to haue assuaged<br>
With sober words, that sufferance desired,<br>
Till time the tryall of her truth expyred:<br>
And euermore sought <i>Britomart</i> to cleare.<br>
But he the more with furious rage was fyred,<br>
And thrise his hand to kill her did vpreare,<br>
And thrise he drew it backe: so did at last forbeare.<p>
