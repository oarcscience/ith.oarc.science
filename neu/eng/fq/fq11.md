*Cant. XI.*

> *The knight with that old Dragon fights  
> two dayes incessantly:  
> The third him ouerthrowes, and gayns  
> most glorious victory.*

> HIgh time now gan it wex for *Vna faire,*  
> To thinke of those her captiue Parents deare,  
> And their forwasted kingdome to repaire:  
> Whereto whenas they now approched neare,  
> With hartie words her knight she gan to cheare,  
> And in her modest manner thus bespake;  
> Deare knight, as deare, as euer knight was deare,  
> That all these sorrowes suffer for my sake,  
> High heauen behold the tedious toyle, ye for me take.
>
> Now are we come vnto my natiue soyle,  
> And to the place, where all our perils dwell;  
> Here haunts that feend, and does his dayly spoyle,  
> Therefore henceforth be at your keeping well,  
> And euer ready for your foeman fell.  
> The sparke of noble courage now awake,  
> And striue your excellent selfe to excell;  
> That shall ye euermore renowmed make,  
> Aboue all knights on earth, that batteill vndertake.
>
> And pointing forth, lo yonder is (said she)  
> The brasen towre in which my parents deare  
> For dread of that huge feend emprisond be  
> Whom I from far see on the walles appeare  
> Whose sight my feeble soule doth greatly cheare:  
> And on the top of all I do espye  
> The watchman wayting tydings glad to heare,  
> That ô my parents might I happily  
> Vnto you bring, to ease you of your misery.
>
> With that they heard a roaring hideous sound,  
> That all the ayre with terrour filled wide,  
> And seemd vneath to shake the stedfast ground.  
> Eftsoones that dreadfull Dragon they espide,  
> Where stretcht he lay vpon the sunny side  
> Of a great hill, himselfe like a great hill.  
> But all so soone, as he from far descride  
> Those glistring armes, that heauen with light did fill,  
> He rousd himselfe full blith, and hastned them vntill.
>
> Then bad the knight his Lady yede aloofe,  
> And to an hill her selfe with draw aside,  
> From whence she might behold that battailles proof  
> And eke be safe from daunger far descryde:  
> She him obayd, and turnd a little wyde.  
> Now O thou sacred Muse, most learned Dame,  
> Faire ympe of *Phoebus*, and his aged bride,  
> The Nourse of time, and euerlasting fame,  
> That warlike hands ennoblest with immortall name;
>
> O gently come into my feeble brest,  
> Come gently, but not with that mighty rage,  
> Wherewith the martiall troupes thou doest infest,  
> And harts of great Heroës doest enrage,  
> That nought their kindled courage may aswage,  
> Soone as thy dreadfull trompe begins to sownd;  
> The God of warre with his fiers equipage  
> Thou doest awake, sleepe neuer he so sownd,  
> And scared nations doest with horrour sterne astownd.
>
> Faire Goddesse lay that furious fit aside,  
> Till I of warres and bloudy *Mars* do sing,  
> And Briton fields with Sarazin bloud bedyde,  
> Twixt that great faery Queene and Paynim king,  
> That with their horrour heauen and earth did ring,  
> A worke of labour long, and endlesse prayse:  
> But now a while let downe that haughtie string,  
> And to my tunes thy second tenor rayse,  
> That I this man of God his godly armes may blaze.
>
> By this the dreadfull Beast drew nigh to hand,  
> Halfe flying, and halfe footing in his hast,  
> That with his largenesse measured much land,  
> And made wide shadow vnder his huge wast;  
> As mountaine doth the valley ouercast.  
> Approching nigh, he reared high afore  
> His body monstrous, horrible, and vast,  
> Which to increase his wondrous greatnesse more,  
> Was swolne with wrath, & poyson, & with bloudy gore.
>
> And ouer, all with brasen scales was armd,  
> Like plated coate of steele, so couched neare,  
> That nought mote perce, ne might his corse be harmd  
> With dint of sword, nor push of pointed speare;  
> Which as an Eagle, seeing pray appeare,  
> His aery plumes doth rouze, full rudely dight,  
> So shaked he, that horrour was to heare,  
> For as the clashing of an Armour bright,  
> Such noyse his rouzed scales did send vnto the knight.
>
> His flaggy wings when forth he did display,  
> Were like two sayles, in which the hollow wynd  
> Is gathered full, and worketh speedy way:  
> And eke the pennes, that did his pineons bynd,  
> Were like mayne-yards, with flying canuas lynd,  
> With which whenas him list the ayre to beat,  
> And there by force vnwonted passage find,  
> The cloudes before him fled for terrour great,  
> And all the heauens stood still amazed with his threat.
>
> His huge long tayle wound vp in hundred foldes,  
> Does ouerspred his long bras-scaly backe,  
> Whose wreathed boughts when euer he vnfoldes,  
> And thicke entangled knots adown does slacke.  
> Bespotted all with shields of red and blacke,  
> It sweepeth all the land behind him farre,  
> And of three furlongs does but litle lacke;  
> And at the point two stings in-fixed arre,  
> Both deadly sharpe, that sharpest steele exceeden farre.
>
> But stings and sharpest steele did far exceed  
> The sharpnesse of his cruell rending clawes;  
> Dead was it sure, as sure as death in deed,  
> What euer thing does touch his rauenous pawes,  
> Or what within his reach he euer drawes.  
> But his most hideous head my toung to tell  
> Does tremble: for his deepe deuouring iawes  
> Wide gaped, like the griesly mouth of hell,  
> Through which into his darke abisse all rauin fell.
>
> And that more wondrous was, in either iaw  
> Three ranckes of yron teeth enraunged were,  
> In which yet trickling bloud and gobbets raw  
> Of late deuoured bodies did appeare,  
> That sight thereof bred cold congealed feare:  
> Which to increase, and as atonce to kill,  
> A cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphur seare  
> Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still,  
> That all the ayre about with smoke and stench did fill.
>
> His blazing eyes, like two bright shining shields,  
> Did burne with wrath, and sparkled liuing fyre;  
> As two broad Beacons, set in open fields,  
> Send forth their flames farre off to euery shyre,  
> And warning giue, that enemies conspyre,  
> With fire and sword the region to inuade;  
> So flam'd his eyne with rage and rancorous yre:  
> But farre within, as in a hollow glade,  
> Those glaring lampes were set, that made a dreadfull shade.
>
> So dreadfully he towards him did pas,  
> Forelifting vp aloft his speckled brest,  
> And often bounding on the brused gras,  
> As for great ioyance of his newcome guest.  
> Eftsoones he gan aduance his haughtie crest,  
> As chauffed Bore his bristles doth vpreare,  
> And shoke his scales to battell readie drest;  
> That made the *Redcrosse* knight nigh quake for feare,  
> As bidding bold defiance to his foeman neare.
>
> The knight gan fairely couch his steadie speare,  
> And fiercely ran at him with rigorous might:  
> The pointed steele arriuing rudely theare,  
> His harder hide would neither perce, nor bight,  
> But glauncing by forth passed forward right;  
> Yet sore amoued with so puissant push,  
> The wrathfull beast about him turned light,  
> And him so rudely passing by, did brush  
> With his long tayle, that horse and man to ground did rush.
>
> Both horse and man vp lightly rose againe,  
> And fresh encounter towards him addrest:  
> But th'idle stroke yet backe recoyld in vaine,  
> And found no place his deadly point to rest.  
> Exceeding rage enflam'd the furious beast,  
> To be auenged of so great despight;  
> For neuer felt his imperceable brest  
> So wondrous force, from hand of liuing wight;  
> Yet had he prou'd the powre of many a puissant knight.
>
> Then with his wauing wings displayed wyde,  
> Himselfe vp high he lifted from the ground,  
> And with strong flight did forcibly diuide  
> The yielding aire, which nigh too feeble found  
> Her flitting partes, and element vnsound,  
> To beare so great a weight: he cutting way  
> With his broad sayles, about him soared round:  
> At last low stouping with vnweldie sway,  
> Snatcht vp both horse & man, to beare them quite away.
>
> Long he them bore aboue the subiect plaine,  
> So farre as Ewghen bow a shaft may send,  
> Till struggling strong did him at last constraine,  
> To let them downe before his flightes end:  
> As hagard hauke presuming to contend  
> With hardie fowle, aboue his hable might,  
> His wearie pounces all in vaine doth spend,  
> To trusse the pray too heauie for his flight;  
> Which comming downe to ground, does free it selfe by fight.
>
> He so disseized of his gryping grosse,  
> The knight his thrillant speare againe assayd  
> In his bras-plated body to embosse,  
> And three mens strength vnto the stroke he layd;  
> Wherewith the stiffe beame quaked, as affrayd,  
> And glauncing from his scaly necke, did glyde  
> Close vnder his left wing, then broad displayd.  
> The percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde,  
> That with the vncouth smart the Monster lowdly cryde.
>
> He cryde, as raging seas are wont to rore,  
> When wintry storme his wrathfull wreck does threat,  
> The rolling billowes beat the ragged shore,  
> As they the earth would shoulder from her seat,  
> And greedie gulfe does gape, as he would eat  
> His neighbour element in his reuenge:  
> Then gin the blustring brethren boldly threat,  
> To moue the world from off his stedfast henge,  
> And boystrous battell make, each other to auenge.
>
> The steely head stucke fast still in his flesh,  
> Till with his cruell clawes he snatcht the wood,  
> And quite a sunder broke. Forth flowed fresh  
> A gushing riuer of blacke goarie blood,  
> That drowned all the land, whereon he stood;  
> The streame thereof would driue a water-mill.  
> Trebly augmented was his furious mood  
> With bitter sense of his deepe rooted ill,  
> That flames of fire he threw forth frõ his large nosethrill.
>
> His hideous tayle then hurled he about,  
> And therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes  
> Of his froth-fomy steed, whose courage stout  
> Striuing to loose the knot, that fast him tyes,  
> Himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes,  
> That to the ground he is perforce constraynd  
> To throw his rider: who can quickly ryse  
> From off the earth, with durty bloud distaynd,  
> For that reprochfull fall right fowly he disdaynd.
>
> And fiercely tooke his trenchand blade in hand,  
> With which he stroke so furious and so fell,  
> That nothing seemd the puissance could withstand:  
> Vpon his crest the hardned yron fell,  
> But his more hardned crest was armd so well,  
> That deeper dint therein it would not make;  
> Yet so extremely did the buffe him quell,  
> That from thenceforth he shund the like to take,  
> But when he saw them come, he did them still forsake.
>
> The knight was wrath to see his stroke beguyld,  
> And smote againe with more outrageous might;  
> But backe againe the sparckling steele recoyld,  
> And left not any marke, where it did light;  
> As if in Adamant rocke it had bene pight.  
> The beast impatient of his smarting wound,  
> And of so fierce and forcible despight,  
> Thought with his wings to stye aboue the ground;  
> But his late wounded wing vnseruiceable found.
>
> Then full of griefe and anguish vehement,  
> He lowdly brayd, that like was neuer heard,  
> And from his wide deuouring ouen sent  
> A flake of fire, that flashing in his beard,  
> Him all amazd, and almost made affeard:  
> The scorching flame sore swinged all his face,  
> And through his armour all his bodie seard,  
> That he could not endure so cruell cace,  
> But thought his armes to leaue, and helmet to vnlace.
>
> Not that great Champion of the antique world,  
> Whom famous Poetes verse so much doth vaunt,  
> And hath for twelue huge labours high extold,  
> So many furies and sharpe fits did haunt,  
> When him the poysoned garment did enchaunt  
> With *Centaures* bloud, and bloudie verses charm'd,  
> As did this knight twelue thousand dolours daunt,  
> Whom fyrie steele now burnt, that earst him arm'd,  
> That erst him goodly arm'd, now most of all him harm'd.
>
> Faint, wearie, sore, emboyled, grieued, brent  
> With heat, toyle, wounds, armes, smart, & inward fire  
> That neuer man such mischiefes did torment;  
> Death better were, death did he oft desire,  
> But death will neuer come, when needes require.  
> Whom so dismayd when that his foe beheld,  
> He cast to suffer him no more respire,  
> But gan his sturdie sterne about to weld,  
> And him so strongly stroke, that to the ground him feld.
>
> It fortuned (as faire it then befell)  
> Behind his backe vnweeting, where he stood,  
> Of auncient time there was a springing well,  
> From which fast trickled forth a siluer flood,  
> Full of great vertues, and for med'cine good.  
> Whylome, before that cursed Dragon got  
> That happie land, and all with innocent blood  
> Defyld those sacred waues, it rightly hot  
> *The well of life*, ne yet his vertues had forgot.
>
> For vnto life the dead it could restore,  
> And guilt of sinfull crimes cleane wash away,  
> Those that with sicknesse were infected sore,  
> It could recure, and aged long decay  
> Renew, as one were borne that very day.  
> Both *Silo* this, and *Iordan* did excell,  
> And th'English *Bath*, and eke the german *Spau*,  
> Ne can *Cephise*, nor *Hebrus* match this well:  
> Into the same the knight backe ouerthrowen, fell.
>
> Now gan the golden *Phoebus* for to steepe  
> His fierie face in billowes of the west,  
> And his faint steedes watred in Ocean deepe,  
> Whiles from their iournall labours they did rest,  
> When that infernall Monster, hauing kest  
> His wearie foe into that liuing well,  
> Can high aduance his broad discoloured brest,  
> Aboue his wonted pitch, with countenance fell,  
> And clapt his yron wings, as victor he did dwell.
>
> Which when his pensiue Ladie saw from farre,  
> Great woe and sorrow did her soule assay,  
> As weening that the sad end of the warre,  
> And gan to highest God entirely pray,  
> That feared chance from her to turne away;  
> With folded hands and knees full lowly bent  
> All night she watcht, ne once adowne would lay  
> Her daintie limbs in her sad dreriment,  
> But praying still did wake, and waking did lament.
>
> The morrow next gan early to appeare,  
> That *Titan* rose to runne his daily race:  
> But early ere the morrow next gan reare  
> Out of the sea faire *Titans* deawy face,  
> Vp rose the gentle virgin from her place,  
> And looked all about, if she might spy  
> Her loued knight to moue his manly pace:  
> For she had great doubt of his safety,  
> Since late she saw him fall before his enemy.
>
> At last she where he vpstarted braue  
> Out of the well, wherein he drenched lay;  
> As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean waue,  
> Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray,  
> And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay,  
> Like Eyas hauke vp mounts vnto the skies,  
> His newly budded pineons to assay,  
> And marueiles at himselfe, still as he flies:  
> So new this new-borne knight to battell new did rise.
>
> Whom when the damned feend so fresh did spy,  
> No wonder if he wondred at the sight,  
> And doubted, whether his late enemy  
> It were, or other new supplied knight.  
> He, now to proue his late renewed might,  
> High brandishing his bright deaw-burning blade,  
> Vpon his crested scalpe so sore did smite,  
> That to the scull a yawning wound it made:  
> The deadly dint his dulled senses all dismaid.
>
> I wote not, whether the reuenging steele  
> Were hardned with that holy water dew,  
> Wherein he fell, or sharper edge did feele,  
> Or his baptized hands now greater grew;  
> Or other secret vertue did ensew;  
> Else neuer could the force of fleshly arme,  
> Ne molten mettall in his bloud embrew:  
> For till that stownd could neuer wight him harme,  
> By subtilty, nor slight, nor might, nor mighty charme.
>
> The cruell wound enraged him so sore,  
> That loud he yelded for exceeding paine;  
> As hundred ramping Lyons seem'd to rore,  
> Whom rauenous hunger did thereto constraine:  
> Then gan he tosse aloft his stretched traine,  
> And therewith scourge the buxome aire so sore,  
> That to his force to yeelden it was faine;  
> Ne ought his sturdie strokes might stand afore,  
> That high trees ouerthrew, and rocks in peeces tore.
>
> The same aduauncing high aboue his head,  
> With sharpe intended sting so rude him smot,  
> That to the earth him droue, as stricken dead,  
> Ne liuing wight would haue him life behot:  
> The mortall sting his angry needle shot  
> Quite through his shield, and in his shoulder seasd,  
> Where fast it stucke, ne would there out be got:  
> The griefe thereof him wondrous sore diseasd,  
> Ne might his ranckling paine with patience be appeasd.
>
> But yet more mindfull of his honour deare,  
> Then of the grieuous smart, which him did wring,  
> From loathed soile he can him lightly reare,  
> And stroue to loose the farre infixed sting:  
> Which when in vaine he tryde with struggeling.  
> Inflam'd with wrath, his raging blade he heft,  
> And.strooke so strongly, that the knotty string  
> Of his huge taile he quite a sunder cleft,  
> Fiue ioynts thereof he hewd, and but the stump him left.
>
> Hart cannot thinke, what outrage, and what cryes,  
> With foule enfouldred smoake and flashing fire,  
> The hell-bred beast threw forth vnto the skyes,  
> That all was couered with darknesse dire:  
> Then fraught with rancour, and engorged ire,  
> He cast at once him to auenge for all,  
> And gathering vp himselfe out of the mire,  
> With his vneuen wings did fiercely fall  
> Vpon his sunne-bright shield, and gript it fast withall.
>
> Much was the man encombred with his hold,  
> In feare to lose his weapon in his paw,  
> Ne wist yet, how his talants to vnfold;  
> Nor harder was from *Cerberus* greedie iaw  
> To plucke a bone, then from his cruell claw  
> To reaue by strength the griped gage away:  
> Thrise he assayd it from his foot to draw,  
> And thrise in vaine to draw it did assay,  
> It booted nought to thinke, to robbe him of his pray.
>
> Tho when he saw no power might preuaile,  
> His trustie sword he cald to his last aid,  
> Wherewith he fiercely did his foe assaile,  
> And double blowes about him stoutly laid,  
> That glauncing fire out of the yron plaid;  
> As sparckles from the Anduile vse to fly,  
> When heauie hammers on the wedge are swaid;  
> Therewith at last he forst him to vnty  
> One of his grasping feete, him to defend thereby.
>
> The other foot, fast fixed on his shield,  
> Whenas no strength, nor stroks mote him constraine  
> To loose, ne yet the warlike pledge to yield,  
> He smot thereat with all his might and maine,  
> That nought so wondrous puissance might sustaine;  
> Vpon the ioynt the lucky steele did light,  
> And made such way, that hewd it quite in twaine;  
> The paw yet missed not his minisht might,  
> But hong still on the shield, as it at first was pight.
>
> For griefe thereof, and diuelish despight,  
> From his infernall fournace forth he threw  
> Huge flames, that dimmed all the heauens light,  
> Enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew;  
> As burning *Aetna* from his boyling stew  
> Doth belch out flames, and rockes in peeces broke,  
> And ragged ribs of mountaines molten new,  
> Enwrapt in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke,  
> That all the land with stench, and heauen with horror choke.
>
> The heate whereof, and harmefull pestilence  
> So sore him noyd, that forst him to retire  
> A little backward for his best defence,  
> To saue his bodie from the scorching fire,  
> Which he from hellish entrailes did expire.  
> It chaunst (eternall God that chaunce did guide)  
> As he recoyled backward, in the mire  
> His nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide,  
> And downe he fell, with dread of shame sore terrifide.
>
> There grew a goodly tree him faire beside,  
> Loaden with fruit and apples rosie red,  
> As they in pure vermilion had beene dide,  
> Whereof great vertues ouer all were red:  
> For happie life to all, which thereon fed,  
> And life eke euerlasting did befall:  
> Great God it planted in that blessed sted  
> With his almightie hand, and did it call  
> The tree of life, the crime of our first fathers fall.
>
> In all the world like was not to be found,  
> Saue in that soile, where all good things did grow,  
> And freely sprong out of the fruitfull ground,  
> As incorrupted Nature did them sow,  
> Till that dread Dragon all did ouerthrow.  
> Another like faire tree eke grew thereby,  
> Whereof who so did eat, eftsoones did know  
> Both good and ill: O mornefull memory:  
> That tree through one mans fault hath doen vs all to dy.
>
> From that first tree forth flowd, as from a well,  
> A trickling streame of Balme, most soueraine  
> And daintie deare, which on the ground still fell,  
> And ouerflowed all the fertill plaine,  
> As it had deawed bene with timely raine:  
> Life and long health that gratious ointment gaue,  
> And deadly woundes could heale, and reare againe  
> The senselesse corse appointed for the graue.  
> Into that same he fell: which did from death him saue.
>
> For nigh thereto the euer damned beast  
> Durst not approch, for he was deadly made,  
> And all that life preserued, did detest:  
> Yet he it oft aduentur'd to inuade.  
> By this the drouping day-light gan to fade  
> And yeeld his roome to sad succeeding night,  
> Who with her sable mantle gan to shade  
> The face of earth, and wayes of liuing wight,  
> And high her burning torch set vp in heauen bright.
>
> When gentle *Vna* saw the second fall  
> Of her deare knight, who wearie of long fight,  
> And faint through losse of bloud, mou'd not at all,  
> But lay as in a dreame of deepe delight,  
> Besmeard with pretious Balme, whose vertuous might  
> Did heale his wounds, and scorching heat alay,  
> Againe she stricken was with sore affright,  
> And for his safetie gan deuoutly pray;  
> And watch the noyous night, and wait for ioyous day.
>
> The ioyous day gan early to appeare,  
> And faire *Aurora* from the deawy bed  
> Of aged *Tithone* gan her selfe to reare,  
> With rosie cheekes, for shame as blushing red;  
> Her golden lockes for haste were loosely shed  
> About her eares, when *Vna* her did marke  
> Clymbe to her charet, all with flowers spred;  
> From heauen high to chase the chearelesse darke,  
> With merry note her loud salutes the mounting larke.
>
> Then freshly vp arose the doughtie knight,  
> All healed of his hurts and woundes wide,  
> And did himselfe to battell readie dight;  
> Whose early foe awaiting him beside  
> To haue deuourd, so soone as day he spyde,  
> When now he saw himselfe so freshly reare,  
> As if late fight had nought him damnifyde,  
> He woxe dismayd, and gan his fate to feare;  
> Nathlesse with wonted rage he him aduaunced neare.
>
> And in his first encounter, gaping wide,  
> He thought attonce him to haue swallowd quight,  
> And rusht vpon him with outragious pride;  
> Who him r'encountring fierce, as hauke in flight,  
> Perforce rebutted backe. The weapon bright  
> Taking aduantage of his open iaw,  
> Ran through his mouth with so importune might,  
> That deepe emperst his darksome hollow maw,  
> And back retyrd, his life bloud forth with all did draw.
>
> So downe he fell, and forth his life did breath,  
> That vanisht into smoke and cloudes swift;  
> So downe he fell, that th'earth him vnderneath  
> Did grone, as feeble so great load to lift;  
> So downe he fell, as an huge rockie clift,  
> Whose false foundation waues haue washt away,  
> With dreadfull poyse is from the mayneland rift,  
> And rolling downe, great *Neptune* doth dismay;  
> So downe he fell, and like an heaped mountaine lay.
>
> The knight himselfe euen trembled at his fall,  
> So huge and horrible a masse it seem'd;  
> And his deare Ladie, that beheld it all,  
> Durst not approch for dread, which she misdeem'd,  
> But yet at last, when as the direfull feend  
> She saw not stirre, off-shaking vaine affright,  
> She nigher drew, and saw that ioyous end:  
> Then God she praysd, and thankt her faithfull knight,  
> That had atchieu'd so great a conquest by his might.
