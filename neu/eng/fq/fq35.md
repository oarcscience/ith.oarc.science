*Cant. IX.*

> *Malbecco will no straunge knights host,  
> For peeuish gealosie:  
> Paridell giusts with Britomart:  
> Both shew their auncestrie.*

> R Edoubted knights, and honorable Dames,  
> To whom I leuell all my labours end,  
> Right sore I feare, least with vnworthy blames  
> This odious argument my rimes should shend,  
> Or ought your goodly patience offend,  
> Whiles of a wanton Lady I do write,  
> Which with her loose incontinence doth blend  
> The shyning glory of your soueraigne light,  
> And knighthood fowle defaced by a faithlesse knight.
>
> But neuer let th'ensample of the bad  
> Offend the good: for good by paragone  
> Of euill, may more notably be rad,  
> As white seemes fairer, macht with blacke attone;  
> Ne all are shamed by the fault of one;  
> For lo in heauen, whereas all goodnesse is,  
> Emongst the Angels, a whole legione  
> Of wicked Sprights did fall from happy blis;  
> What wonder then, if one of women all did mis?
>
> Then listen Lordings, if ye list to weet  
> The cause, why *Satyrane* and *Paridell*  
> Mote not be entertaynd, as seemed meet,  
> Into that Castle (as that Squire does tell.)  
> Therein a cancred crabbed Carle does dwell,  
> That has no skill of Court nor courtesie,  
> Ne cares, what men say of him ill or well;  
> For all his dayes he drownes in priuitie,  
> Yet has full large to liue, and spend at libertie.
>
> But all his mind is set on mucky pelfe,  
> To hoord vp heapes of euill gotten masse,  
> For which he others wrongs, and wreckes himselfe;  
> Yet is he lincked to a louely lasse,  
> Whose beauty doth her bounty far surpasse,  
> The which to him both far vnequall yeares,  
> And also far vnlike conditions has;  
> For she does ioy to play emongst her peares,  
> And to be free from hard restraint and gealous feares.
>
> But he is old, and withered like hay,  
> Vnfit faire Ladies seruice to supply;  
> The priuie guilt whereof makes him alway  
> Suspect her truth, and keepe continuall spy  
> Vpon her with his other blincked eye;  
> Ne suffreth he resort of liuing wight  
> Approch to her, ne keepe her company,  
> But in close bowre her mewes from all mens sight,  
> Depriu'd of kindly ioy and naturall delight.
>
> *Malbecco* he, and *Hellenore* she hight,  
> Vnfitly yokt together in one teeme,  
> That is the cause, why neuer any knight  
> Is suffred here to enter, but he seeme  
> Such, as no doubt of him he neede misdeeme.  
> Thereat Sir *Satyrane* gan smile, and say;  
> Extremely mad the man I surely deeme,  
> That weenes with watch and hard restraint to stay  
> A womans will, which is disposd to go astray.
>
> In vaine he feares that, which he cannot shonne:  
> For who wotes not, that womans subtiltyes  
> Can guilen *Argus*, when she list misdonne?  
> It is not yron bandes, nor hundred eyes,  
> Nor brasen walls, nor many wakefull spyes,  
> That can withhold her wilfull wandring feet;  
> But fast good will with gentle curtesyes,  
> And timely seruice to her pleasures meet  
> May her perhaps containe, that else would algates fleet.
>
> Then is he not more mad (said *Paridell*)  
> That hath himselfe vnto such seruice sold,  
> In dolefull thraldome all his dayes to dwell?  
> For sure a foole I do him firmely hold,  
> That loues his fetters, though they were of gold.  
> But why do we deuise of others ill,  
> Whiles thus we suffer this same dotard old,  
> To keepe vs out, in scorne of his owne will,  
> And rather do not ransack all, and him selfe kill?
>
> Nay let vs first (said *Satyrane*\[)\] entreat  
> The man by gentle meanes, to let vs in,  
> And afterwardes affray with cruell threat,  
> Ere that we to efforce it do begin:  
> Then if all fayle, we will by force it win,  
> And eke reward the wretch for his mesprise,  
> As may be worthy of his haynous sin.  
> That counsell pleasd: then *Paridell* did rise,  
> And to the Castle gate approcht in quiet wise.
>
> Whereat soft knocking, entrance he desyrd.  
> The good man selfe, which then the Porter playd,  
> Him answered, that all were now retyrd  
> Vnto their rest, and all the keyes conuayd  
> Vnto their maister, who in bed was layd,  
> That none him durst awake out of his dreme;  
> And therefore them of patience gently prayd.  
> Then *Paridell* began to chaunge his theme,  
> And threatned him with force & punishment extreme.
>
> But all in vaine; for nought mote him relent,  
> And now so long before the wicket fast  
> They wayted, that the night was forward spent,  
> And the faire welkin fowly ouercast,  
> Gan blowen vp a bitter stormy blast,  
> With shoure and hayle so horrible and dred,  
> That this faire many were compeld at last,  
> To fly for succour to a little shed,  
> The which beside the gate for swine was ordered.
>
> It fortuned, soone after they were gone,  
> Another knight, whom tempest thither brought,  
> Came to that Castle, and with earnest mone,  
> Like as the rest, late entrance deare besought;  
> But like so as the rest he prayd for nought,  
> For flatly he of entrance was refusd,  
> Sorely thereat he was displeasd, and thought  
> How to auenge himselfe so sore abusd,  
> And euermore the Carle of curtesie accusd.
>
> But to auoyde th'intollerable stowre,  
> He was compeld to seeke some refuge neare,  
> And to that shed, to shrowd him from the showre,  
> He came, which full of guests he found whyleare,  
> So as he was not let to enter there:  
> Whereat he gan to wex exceeding wroth,  
> And swore, that he would lodge with them yfere,  
> Or them dislodge, all were they liefe or loth;  
> And so defide them each, and so defide them both.
>
> Both were full loth to leaue that needfull tent,  
> And both full loth in darkenesse to debate;  
> Yet both full liefe him lodging to haue lent,  
> And both full liefe his boasting to abate;  
> But chiefly *Paridell* his hart did grate,  
> To heare him threaten so despightfully.  
> As if he did a dogge to kenell rate,  
> That durst not barke; and rather had he dy,  
> Then when he was defide, in coward corner ly.
>
> Tho hastily remounting to his steed,  
> He forth issew'd; like as a boistrous wind,  
> Which in th'earthes hollow caues hath long bin hid,  
> And shut vp fast within her prisons blind,  
> Makes the huge element against her kind  
> To moue, and tremble as it were agast,  
> Vntill that it an issew forth may find;  
> Then forth it breakes, and with his furious blast  
> Confounds both land & seas, and skyes doth ouercast.
>
> Their steel-hed speares they strongly coucht, and met  
> Together with impetuous rage and forse,  
> That with the terrour of their fierce affret,  
> They rudely droue to ground both man and horse,  
> That each awhile lay like a sencelesse corse.  
> But *Paridell* sore brused with the blow,  
> Could not arise, the counterchaunge to scorse,  
> Till that young Squire him reared from below;  
> Then drew he his bright sword, & gan about him throw.
>
> But *Satyrane* forth stepping, did them stay  
> And with faire treatie pacifide their ire,  
> Then when they were accorded from the fray,  
> Against that Castles Lord they gan conspire,  
> To heape on him dew vengeaunce for his hire.  
> They bene agreed, and to the gates they goe  
> To burne the same with vnquenchable fire,  
> And that vncurteous Carle their commune foe  
> To do fowle death to dye, or wrap in grieuous woe.
>
> *Malbecco* seeing them resolu'd in deed  
> To flame the gates, and hearing them to call  
> For fire in earnest, ran with fearefull speed,  
> And to them calling from the castle wall,  
> Besought them humbly, him to beare withal,  
> As ignoraunt of seruants bad abuse,  
> And slacke attendaunce vnto straungers call.  
> The knights were willing all things to excuse,  
> Though nought beleu'd, & entraũce late did not refuse.
>
> They bene ybrought into a comely bowre,  
> And seru'd of all things that mote needfull bee;  
> Yet secretly their hoste did on them lowre,  
> And welcomde more for feare, then charitee;  
> But they dissembled, what they did not see,  
> And welcomed themselues. Each gan vndight  
> Their garments wet, and weary armour free,  
> To dry them selues by *Vulcanes* flaming light,  
> And eke their lately bruzed parts to bring in plight.
>
> And eke that straunger knight emongst the rest;  
> Was for like need enforst to disaray:  
> Tho whenas vailed was her loftie crest,  
> Her golden locks, that were in tramels gay  
> Vpbounden, did them selues adowne display,  
> And raught vnto her heeles; like sunny beames,  
> That in a cloud their light did long time stay,  
> Their vapour vaded, shew their golden gleames,  
> And through the persant aire shoote forth their azure streames.
>
> She also dofte her heauy haberieon,  
> Which the faire feature of her limbs did hyde,  
> And her well plighted frock, which she did won  
> To tucke about her short, when she did ryde,  
> She low let fall, that flowd from her lanck syde  
> Downe to her foot, with carelesse modestee.  
> Then of them all she plainly was espyde,  
> To be a woman wight, vnwist to bee,  
> The fairest woman wight, that euer eye did see.
>
> Like as *Minerua*, being late returnd  
> From slaughter of the Giaunts conquered;  
> Where proud *Encelade*, whose wide nosethrils burnd  
> With breathed flames, like to a furnace red,  
> Transfixed with the speare, downe tombled ded  
> From top of *Hemus*, by him heaped hye;  
> Hath loosd her helmet from her lofty hed,  
> And her *Gorgonian* shield gins to vntye  
> From her left arme, to rest in glorious victorye.
>
> Which whenas they beheld, they smitten were  
> With great amazement of so wondrous sight,  
> And each on other, and they all on her  
> Stood gazing, as if suddein great affright  
> Had them surprised. At last auizing right,  
> Her goodly personage and glorious hew,  
> Which they so much mistooke, they tooke delight  
> In their first errour, and yet still anew  
> With wonder of her beauty fed their hungry vew.
>
> Yet note their hungry vew be satisfide,  
> But seeing still the more desir'd to see,  
> And euer firmely fixed did abide  
> In contemplation of diuinitie:  
> But most they meruail\[e\]d at her cheualree,  
> And noble prowesse, which they had approued,  
> That much they faynd to know, who she mote bee;  
> Yet none of all them her thereof amoued,  
> Yet euery one her likte, and euery one her loued.
>
> And *Paridell* though partly discontent  
> With his late fall, and fowle indignity,  
> Yet was soone wonne his malice to relent,  
> Through gracious regard of her faire eye,  
> And knightly worth, which he too late did try,  
> Yet tried did adore. Supper was dight;  
> Then they *Malbecco* prayd of curtesy,  
> That of his Lady they might haue the sight,  
> And company at meat, to do them more delight.
>
> But he to shift their curious request,  
> Gan causen, why she could not come in place;  
> Her crased health, her late recourse to rest,  
> And humid euening ill for sicke folkes cace:  
> But none of those excuses could take place;  
> Ne would they eate, till she in presence came.  
> She came in presence with right comely grace,  
> And fairely them saluted, as became,  
> And shewd her selfe in all a gentle curteous Dame.
>
> They sate to meat, and *Satyrane* his chaunce  
> Was her before, and *Paridell* besyde;  
> But he him selfe sate looking still askaunce,  
> Gainst *Britomart*, and euer closely eyde  
> Sir *Satyrane*, that glaunces might not glyde:  
> But his blind eye, that syded *Paridell*,  
> All his demeasnure from his sight did hyde:  
> On her faire face so did he feede his fill,  
> And sent close messages of loue to her at will.
>
> And euer and anone, when none was ware,  
> With speaking lookes, that close embassage bore,  
> He rou'd at her, and told his secret care:  
> For all that art he learned had of yore.  
> Ne was she ignoraunt of that lewd lore,  
> But in his eye his meaning wisely red,  
> And with the like him answerd euermore:  
> She sent at him one firie dart, whose hed  
> Empoisned was with priuy lust, and gealous dred.
>
> He from that deadly throw made no defence,  
> But to the wound his weake hart opened wyde;  
> The wicked engine through false influence,  
> Past through his eyes, and secretly did glyde  
> Into his hart, which it did sorely gryde.  
> But nothing new to him was that same paine,  
> Ne paine at all; for he so oft had tryde  
> The powre thereof, and lou'd so oft in vaine,  
> That thing of course he counted, loue to entertaine.
>
> Thenceforth to her he sought to intimate  
> His inward griefe, by meanes to him well knowne,  
> Now *Bacchus* fruit out of the siluer plate  
> He on the table dasht, as ouerthrowne,  
> Or of the fruitfull liquor ouerflowne,  
> And by the dauncing bubbles did diuine,  
> Or therein write to let his loue be showne;  
> Which well she red out of the learned line,  
> A sacrament prophane in mistery of wine.
>
> And when so of his hand the pledge she raught,  
> The guilty cup she fained to mistake,  
> And in her lap did shed her idle draught,  
> Shewing desire her inward flame to slake:  
> By such close signes they secret way did make  
> Vnto their wils, and one eyes watch escape;  
> Two eyes him needeth, for to watch and wake,  
> Who louers will deceiue. Thus was the ape,  
> By their faire handling, put into *Malbeccoes* cape.
>
> Now when of meats and drinks they had their fill,  
> Purpose was moued by that gentle Dame,  
> Vnto those knights aduenturous, to tell  
> Of deeds of armes, which vnto them became,  
> And euery one his kindred, and his name.  
> Then *Paridell*, in whom a kindly pryde  
> Of gracious speach, and skill his words to frame  
> Abounded, being glad of so fit tyde  
> Him to commend to her, thus spake, of all well eyde.
>
> *Troy*, that art now nought, but an idle name,  
> And in thine ashes buried low dost lie,  
> Though whilome far much greater then thy fame,  
> Before that angry Gods, and cruell skye  
> Vpon thee heapt a direfull destinie,  
> What boots it boast thy glorious descent,  
> And fetch from heauen thy great Genealogie,  
> Sith all thy worthy prayses being blent,  
> Their of-spring hath embaste, and later glory shent.
>
> Most famous Worthy of the world, by whome  
> That warre was kindled, which did *Troy* inflame,  
> And stately towres of *Ilion* whilome  
> Brought vnto balefull ruine, was by name  
> Sir *Paris* far renowmd through noble fame,  
> Who through great prowesse and bold hardinesse,  
> From *Lacedæmon* fetcht the fairest Dame,  
> That euer *Greece* did boast, or knight possesse,  
> Whom *Venus* to him gaue for meed of worthinesse.
>
> Faire *Helene*, flowre of beautie excellent,  
> And girlond of the mighty Conquerours,  
> That madest many Ladies deare lament  
> The heauie losse of their braue Paramours,  
> Which they far off beheld from *Troian* toures,  
> And saw the fieldes of faire *Scamander* strowne  
> With carcases of noble warrioures,  
> Whose fruitlesse liues were vnder furrow sowne,  
> And *Xanthus* sandy bankes with bloud all ouerflowne.
>
> From him my linage I deriue aright,  
> Who long before the ten yeares siege of *Troy*,  
> Whiles yet on *Ida* he a shepheard hight,  
> On faire *Oenone* got a louely boy,  
> Whom for remembraunce of her passed ioy,  
> She of his Father *Parius* did name;  
> Who, after *Greekes* did *Priams* realme destroy,  
> Gathred the *Troian* reliques sau'd from flame,  
> And with them sayling thence, to th'Isle of *Paros* came.
>
> That was by him cald *Paros*, which before  
> Hight *Nausa*, there he many yeares did raine,  
> And built *Nausicle* by the *Pontick* shore,  
> The which he dying left next in remaine  
> To *Paridas* his sonne.  
> From whom I *Paridell* by kin descend;  
> But for faire Ladies loue, and glories gaine,  
> My natiue soile haue left, my dayes to spend  
> In sewing deeds of armes, my liues and labours end.
>
> Whenas the noble *Britomart* heard tell  
> Of *Troian* warres, and *Priams* Citie sackt,  
> The ruefull story of Sir *Paridell*,  
> She was empassiond at that piteous act,  
> With zelous enuy of Greekes cruell fact,  
> Against that nation, from whose race of old  
> She heard, that she was lineally extract:  
> For noble *Britons* sprong from *Troians* bold,  
> And *Troynouant* was built of old *Troyes* ashes cold.
>
> Then sighing soft awhile, at last she thus:  
> O lamentable fall of famous towne,  
> Which raignd so many yeares victorious,  
> And of all *Asie* bore the soueraigne crowne,  
> In one sad night consumd, and throwen downe:  
> What stony hart, that heares thy haplesse fate,  
> Is not empierst with deepe compassiowne,  
> And makes ensample of mans wretched state,  
> That floures so fresh at morne, and fades at euening late?
>
> Behold, Sir, how your pitifull complaint  
> Hath found another partner of your payne:  
> For nothing may impresse so deare constraint,  
> As countries cause, and commune foes disdayne.  
> But if it should not grieue you, backe agayne  
> To turne your course, I would to heare desyre,  
> What to *Aeneas* fell; sith that men sayne  
> He was not in the Cities wofull fyre  
> Consum'd, but did him selfe to safetie retyre.
>
> *Anchyses* sonne begot of *Venus* faire,  
> (Said he,) out of the flames for safegard fled,  
> And with a remnant did to sea repaire,  
> Where he through fatall errour long was led  
> Full many yeares, and weetlesse wandered  
> From shore to shore, emongst the Lybicke sands,  
> Ere rest he found. Much there he suffered,  
> And many perils past in forreine lands,  
> To saue his people sad from victours vengefull hands.
>
> At last in *Latium* he did arriue,  
> Where he with cruell warre was entertaind  
> Of th'inland folke, which sought him backe to driue,  
> Till he with old *Latinus* was constraind,  
> To contract wedlock: (so the fates ordaind.)  
> Wedlock contract in bloud, and eke in blood  
> Accomplished, that many deare complaind:  
> The riuall slaine, the victour through the flood  
> Escaped hardly, hardly praisd his wedlock good.
>
> Yet after all, he victour did suruiue,  
> And with *Latinus* did the kingdome part.  
> But after when both nations gan to striue,  
> Into their names the title to conuart,  
> His sonne *Iulus* did from thence depart,  
> With all the warlike youth of *Troians* bloud,  
> And in long *Alba* plast his throne apart,  
> Where faire it florished, and long time it stoud,  
> Till *Romulus* renewing it, to *Rome* remoud.
>
> There there (said *Britomart*) a fresh appeard  
> The glory of the later world to spring,  
> And *Troy* againe out of her dust was reard,  
> To sit in second seat of soueraigne king,  
> Of all the world vnder her gouerning.  
> But a third kingdome yet is to arise,  
> Out of the *Troians* scattered of-spring,  
> That in all glory and great enterprise,  
> Both first and second *Troy* shall dare to equalise.
>
> It *Troynouant* is hight, that with the waues  
> Of wealthy *Thamis* washed is along,  
> Vpon whose stubborne neck, whereat he raues  
> With roring rage, and sore him selfe does throng,  
> That all men feare to tempt his billowes strong,  
> She fastned hath her foot, which standes so hy,  
> That it a wonder of the world is song  
> In forreine landes, and all which passen by,  
> Beholding it from far, do thinke it threates the skye.
>
> The *Troian Brute* did first that Citie found,  
> And Hygate made the meare thereof by West,  
> And *Ouert* gate by North: that is the bound  
> Toward the land; two riuers bound the rest.  
> So huge a scope at first him seemed best,  
> To be the compasse of his kingdomes seat:  
> So huge a mind could not in lesser rest,  
> Ne in small meares containe his glory great,  
> That *Albion* had conquered first by warlike feat.
>
> Ah fairest Lady knight, (said *Paridell*)  
> Pardon I pray my heedlesse ouersight,  
> Who had forgot, that whilome I heard tell  
> From aged *Mnemon*; for my wits bene light.  
> Indeed he said (if I remember right,)  
> That of the antique *Troian* stocke, there grew  
> Another plant, that raught to wondrous hight,  
> And far abroad his mighty branches threw,  
> Into the vtmost Angle of the world he knew.
>
> For that same *Brute*, whom much he did aduaunce  
> In all his speach, was *Syluius* his sonne,  
> Whom hauing slaine, through luckles arrowes glaũce  
> He fled for feare of that he had misdonne,  
> Or else for shame, so fowle reproch to shonne,  
> And with him led to sea an youthly trayne,  
> Where wearie wandring they long time did wonne,  
> And many fortunes prou'd in th'*Ocean* mayne,  
> And great aduẽtures found, that now were lõg to sayne.
>
> At last by fatall course they driuen were  
> Into an Island spatious and brode,  
> The furthest North, that did to them appeare:  
> Which after rest they seeking far abrode,  
> Found it the fittest soyle for their abode,  
> Fruitfull of all things fit for liuing foode,  
> But wholy wast, and void of peoples trode,  
> Saue an huge nation of the Geaunts broode,  
> That fed on liuing flesh, & druncke mens vitall blood.
>
> Whom he through wearie wars and labours long,  
> Subdewd with losse of many *Britons* bold:  
> In which the great *Goemagot* of strong  
> *Corineus*, and *Coulin* of *Debon* old  
> Were ouerthrowne and layd on th'earth full cold,  
> Which quaked vnder their so hideous masse,  
> A famous history to be enrold  
> In euerlasting moniments of brasse,  
> That all the antique Worthies merits far did passe.
>
> His worke great *Troynouant*, his worke is eke  
> Faire *Lincolne*, both renowmed far away,  
> That who from East to West will endlong seeke,  
> Cannot two fairer Cities find this day,  
> Except *Cleopolis:* so heard I say  
> Old *Mnemon*. Therefore Sir, I greet you well  
> Your countrey kin, and you entirely pray  
> Of pardon for the strife, which late befell  
> Betwixt vs both vnknowne. So ended *Paridell*.
>
> But all the while, that he these speaches spent,  
> Vpon his lips hong faire Dame *Hellenore*,  
> With vigilant regard, and dew attent,  
> Fashioning worlds of fancies euermore  
> In her fraile wit, that now her quite forlore:  
> The whiles vnwares away her wondring eye,  
> And greedy eares her weake hart from her bore:  
> Which he perceiuing, euer priuily  
> In speaking, many false belgardes at her let fly.
>
> So long these knights discoursed diuersly,  
> Of straunge affaires, and noble hardiment,  
> Which they had past with mickle ieopardy,  
> That now the humid night was farforth spent,  
> And heauenly lampes were halfendeale ybrent:  
> Which th'old man seeing well, who too long thought  
> Euery discourse and euery argument,  
> Which by the houres he measured, besought  
> Them go to rest. So all vnto their bowres were brought.
