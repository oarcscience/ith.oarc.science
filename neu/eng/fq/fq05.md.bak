*Cant. III.*

> *Forsaken Truth long seekes her loue,  
> And makes the Lyon mylde,  
> Marres blind Deuotions mart, and fals  
> In hand of leachour vylde.*

> NOught there vnder heau'ns wilde hollownesse,  
>    That moues more deare compassion of mind,  
>    Then beautie brought t'vnworthy wretchednesse  
>    Through enuies snares or fortunes freakes vnkind:  
>    I, whether lately through her brightnesse blind,  
>    Or through alleageance and fast fealtie,  
>    Which I do owe vnto all woman kind,  
>    Feele my heart perst with so great agonie,  
> When such I see, that all for pittie I could die.
>
> And now it is empassioned so deepe,  
>    For fairest *Vnaes* sake, of whom I sing,  
>   That my fraile eyes these lines with teares do steepe,  
> To thinke how she through guilefull handeling,  
>    Though true as touch, though daughter of a king,  
>    Though faire as euer liuing wight was faire,  
>    Though nor in word nor deede ill meriting,  
>    Is from her knight diuorced in despaire  
> And her due loues deriu'd to that vile witches share.
>
> Yet she most faithfull Ladie all this while  
>    Forsaken, wofull, solitarie mayd  
>    Farre from all peoples prease, as in exile,  
>    In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd,  
>    To seeke her knight; who subtilly betrayd  
>    Through that late vision, which th'Enchaunter wrought,  
>    Had her abandond. She of nought affrayd,  
>    Through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought;  
> Yet wished tydings none of him vnto her brought.
>
> One day nigh wearie of the yrkesome way,  
>    From her vnhastie beast she did alight,  
>    And on the grasse her daintie limbes did lay  
>    In secret shadow, farre from all mens sight:  
>    From her faire head her fillet she vndight,  
>    And laid her stole aside. Her angels face  
>    As the great eye of heauen shyned bright,  
>    And made a sunshine in the shadie place;  
> Did neuer mortall eye behold such heauenly grace.
>
> It fortuned out of the thickest wood  
>    A ramping Lyon rushed suddainly,  
>    Hunting full greedie after saluage blood;  
>    Soone as the royall virgin he did spy,  
>    With gaping mouth at her ran greedily,  
>    To haue attonce deuour'd her tender corse:  
>    But to the pray when as he drew more ny,  
>    His bloudie rage asswaged with remorse,  
> And with the sight amazd, forgat his furious forse.
>
> In stead thereof he kist her wearie feet,  
>    And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong,  
>    As he her wronged innocence did weet.  
>    O how can beautie maister the most strong,  
>    And simple truth subdue auenging wrong?  
>    Whose yeelded pride and proud submission,  
>    Still dreading death, when she had marked long,  
>    Her hart gan melt in great compassion,  
> And drizling teares did shed for pure affection.
>
> The Lyon Lord of euerie beast in field,  
>    Quoth she, his princely puissance doth abate,  
>    And mightie proud to humble weake does yield,  
>    Forgetfull of the hungry rage, which late  
>    Him prickt, in pittie of my sad estate:  
>    But he my Lyon, and my noble Lord,  
>    How does he find in cruell hart to hate  
>    Her that him lou'd, and euer most adord,  
> As the God of my life? why hath he me abhord?
>
> Redounding teares did choke th'end of her plaint,  
>    Which softly ecchoed from the neighbour wood;  
>    And sad to see her sorrowfull constraint  
>    The kingly beast vpon her gazing stood;  
>    With pittie calmd, downe fell his angry mood.  
>    At last in close hart shutting vp her paine,  
>    Arose the virgin borne of heauenly brood,  
>    And to her snowy Palfrey got againe,  
> To seeke her strayed Champion, if she might attaine.
>
> The Lyon would not leaue her desolate,  
>    But with her went along, as a strong gard  
>    Of her chast person, and a faithfull mate  
>    Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard:  
>    Still when she slept, he kept both watch and ward,  
>    And when she wakt, he waited diligent,  
>    With humble seruice to her will prepard:  
>    From her faire eyes he tooke commaundement,  
> And euer by her lookes conceiued her intent.
>
> Long she thus traueiled through deserts wyde,  
>    By which she thought her wandring knight shold pas,  
>    Yet neuer shew of liuing wight espyde;  
>    Till that at length she found the troden gras,  
>    In which the tract of peoples footing was,  
>    Vnder the steepe foot of a mountaine hore;  
>    The same she followes, till at last she has  
>    A damzell spyde slow footing her before,  
> That on her shoulders sad a pot of water bore.
>
> To whom approching she to her gan call,  
>    To weet, if dwelling place were nigh at hand;  
>    But the rude wench her answer'd nought at all,  
>    She could not heare, nor speake, nor vnderstand;  
>    Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand,  
>    With suddaine feare her pitcher downe she threw,  
>    And fled away: for neuer in that land  
>    Face of faire Ladie she before did vew,  
> And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew.
>
> Full fast she fled, ne euer lookt behynd,  
>    As if her life vpon the wager lay,  
>    And home she came, whereas her mother blynd  
>    Sate in eternall night: nought could she say,  
>    But suddaine catching hold, did her dismay  
>    With quaking hands, and other signs of feare:  
>    Who full of ghastly fright and cold affray,  
>    Gan shut the dore. By this arriued there  
> Dame *Vna*, wearie Dame, and entrance did requere.
>
> Which when none yeelded, her vnruly Page  
>    With his rude clawes the wicket open rent,  
>    And let her in; where of his cruell rage  
>    Nigh dead with feare, and faint astonishment,  
>    She found them both in darkesome corner pent;  
>    Where that old woman day and night did pray  
>    Vpon her beades deuoutly penitent;  
>    Nine hundred *Pater nosters* euery day,  
> And thrise nine hundred *Aues* she was wont to say.
>
> And to augment her painefull pennance more,  
>    Thrise euery weeke in ashes she did sit,  
>    And next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore,  
>    And thrise three times did fast from any bit:  
>    But now for feare her beads she did forget.  
>    Whose needlesse dread for to remoue away,  
>    Faire *Vna* framed words and count'nance fit:  
>    Which hardly doen, at length she gan them pray,  
> That in their cotage small, that night she rest her may.
>
> The day is spent, and commeth drowsie night,  
>    When euery creature shrowded is in sleepe;  
>    Sad *Vna* downe her laies in wearie plight,  
>    And at her feet the Lyon watch doth keepe:  
>    In stead of rest, she does lament, and weepe  
>    For the late losse of her deare loued knight,  
>    And sighes, and grones, and euermore does steepe  
>    Her tender brest in bitter teares all night,  
> All night she thinks too long, and often lookes for light.
>
> Now when *Aldeboran* was mounted hie  
>    Aboue the shynie *Cassiopeias* chaire,  
>    And all in deadly sleepe did drowned lie,  
>    One knocked at the dore, and in would fare;  
>    He knocked fast, and often curst, and sware,  
>    That readie entrance was not at his call:  
>    For on his backe a heauy load he bare  
>    Of nightly stelths and pillage seuerall,  
> Which he had got abroad by purchase criminall.
>
> He was to weete a stout and sturdie thiefe,  
>    Wont to robbe Churches of their ornaments,  
>    And poore mens boxes of their due reliefe,  
>    Which giuen was to them for good intents;  
>    The holy Saints of their rich vestiments  
>    He did disrobe, when all men carelesse slept,  
>    And spoild the Priests of their habiliments,  
>    Whiles none the holy things in safety kept;  
> Then he by cunning sleights in at the window crept.
>
> And all that he by right or wrong could find,  
>    Vnto this house he brought, and did bestow  
>    Vpon the daughter of this woman blind,  
>    *Abessa* daughter of *Corceca* slow,  
>    With whom he whoredome vsd, that few did know,  
>    And fed her fat with feast of offerings,  
>    And plentie, which in all the land did grow;  
>    Ne spared he to giue her gold and rings:  
> And now he to her brought part of his stolen things.
>
> Thus long the dore with rage and threats he bet,  
>    Yet of those fearefull women none durst rize,  
>    The Lyon frayed them, him in to let:  
>    He would no longer stay him to aduize,  
>    But open breakes the dore in furious wize,  
>    And entring is; when that disdainfull beast  
>    Encountring fierce, him suddaine doth surprize,  
>    And seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest,  
> Vnder his Lordly foot him proudly hath supprest.
>
> Him booteth not resist, nor succour call,  
>    His bleeding hart is in the vengers hand,  
>    Who streight him rent in thousand peeces small,  
>    And quite dismembred hath: the thirstie land  
>    Drunke vp his life; his corse left on the strand.  
>    His fearefull friends weare out the wofull night,  
>    Ne dare to weepe, nor seeme to vnderstand  
>    The heauie hap, which on them is alight,  
> Affraid, least to themselues the like mishappen might.
>
> Now when broad day the world discouered has,  
>    Vp *Vna* rose, vp rose the Lyon eke,  
>    And on their former iourney forward pas,  
>    In wayes vnknowne, her wandring knight to seeke,  
>    With paines farre passing that long wandring *Greeke*,  
>    That for his loue refused deitie;  
>    Such were the labours of this Lady meeke,  
>    Still seeking him, that from her still did flie,  
> Then furthest from her hope, when most she weened nie.
>
> Soone as she parted thence, the fearefull twaine,  
>    That blind old woman and her daughter deare  
>    Came forth, and finding *Kirkrapine* there slaine,  
>    For anguish great they gan to rend their heare,  
>    And beat their brests, and naked flesh to teare.  
>    And when they both had wept and wayld their fill,  
>    Then forth they ranne like two amazed deare,  
>    Halfe mad through malice, and reuenging will,  
> To follow her, that was the causer of their ill.
>
> Whom ouertaking, they gan loudly bray,  
>    With hollow howling, and lamenting cry,  
>    Shamefully at her rayling all the way,  
>    And her accusing of dishonesty,  
>    That was the flowre of faith and chastity;  
>    And still amidst her rayling, she did pray,  
>    That plagues, and mischiefs, and long misery  
>    Might fall on her, and follow all the way,  
> And that in endlesse error she might euer stray.
>
> But when she saw her prayers nought preuaile,  
>    She backe returned with some labour lost;  
>    And in the way as she did weepe and waile,  
>    A knight her met in mighty armes embost,  
>    Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost,  
>    But subtill *Archimag*, that *Vna* sought  
>    By traynes into new troubles to haue tost:  
>    Of that old woman tydings he besought,  
> If that of such a Ladie she could tellen ought.
>
> Therewith she gan her passion to renew,  
>    And cry, and curse, and raile, and rend her heare,  
>    Saying, that harlot she too lately knew,  
>    That causd her shed so many a bitter teare,  
>    And so forth told the story of her feare:  
>    Much seemed he to mone her haplesse chaunce,  
>    And after for that Ladie did inquere;  
>    Which being taught, he forward gan aduaunce  
> His fair enchaunted steed, and eke his charmed launce.
>
> Ere long he came, where *Vna* traueild slow,  
>    And that wilde Champion wayting her besyde:  
>    Whom seeing such, for dread he durst not show  
>    Himselfe too nigh at hand, but turned wyde  
>    Vnto an hill; from whence when she him spyde,  
>    By his like seeming shield, her knight by name  
>    She weend it was, and towards him gan ryde:  
>    Approching nigh, she wist it was the same,  
> And with faire fearefull humblesse towards him shee came.
>
> And weeping said, Ah my long lacked Lord,  
>    Where haue ye bene thus long out of my sight?  
>    Much feared I to haue bene quite abhord,  
>    Or ought haue done, that ye displeasen might,  
>    That should as death vnto my deare hart light:  
>    For since mine eye your ioyous sight did mis,  
>    My chearefull day is turnd to chearelesse night,  
>    And eke my night of death the shadow is;  
> But welcome now my light, and shining lampe of blis.
>
> He thereto meeting said, My dearest Dame,  
>    Farre be it from your thought, and fro my will,  
>    To thinke that knighthood I so much should shame,  
>    As you to leaue, that haue me loued still,  
>    And chose in Faery court of meere goodwill,  
>    Where noblest knights were to be found on earth:  
>    The earth shall sooner leaue her kindly skill  
>    To bring forth fruit, and make eternall derth,  
> Then I leaue you, my liefe, yborne of heauenly berth.
>
> And sooth to say, why I left you so long,  
>    Was for to seeke aduenture in strange place,  
>    Where *Archimago* said a felon strong  
>    To many knights did daily worke disgrace;  
>    But knight he now shall neuer more deface:  
>    Good cause of mine excuse; that mote ye please  
>    Well to accept, and euermore embrace  
>    My faithfull seruice, that by land and seas  
> Haue vowd you to defend. Now then your plaint appease.
>
> His louely words her seemd due recompence  
>    Of all her passed paines: one louing howre  
>    For many yeares of sorrow can dispence:  
>    A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre:  
>    She has forgot, how many a wofull stowre  
>    For him she late endur'd; she speakes no more  
>    Of past: true is, that true loue hath no powre  
>    To looken backe; his eyes be fixt before.  
> Before her stands her knight, for whom she toyld so sore.
>
> Much like, as when the beaten marinere,  
>    That long hath wandred in the *Ocean* wide,  
>    Oft soust in swelling *Tethys* saltish teare,  
>    And long time hauing tand his tawney hide  
>    With blustring breath of heauen, that none can bide,  
>    And scorching flames of fierce *Orions* hound,  
>    Soone as the port from farre he has espide,  
>    His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound,  
> And *Nereus* crownes with cups; his mates him pledg around.
>
> Such ioy made *Vna*, when her knight she found;  
>    And eke th'enchaunter ioyous seemd no lesse,  
>    Then the glad marchant, that does vew from ground  
>    His ship farre come from watrie wildernesse,  
>    He hurles out vowes, and *Neptune* oft doth blesse:  
>    So forth they past, and all the way they spent  
>    Discoursing of her dreadfull late distresse,  
>    In which he askt her, what the Lyon ment:  
> Who told her all that fell in iourney as she went.
>
> They had not ridden farre, when they might see  
>    One pricking towards them with hastie heat,  
>    Full strongly armd, and on a courser free,  
>    That through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat,  
>    And the sharpe yron did for anger eat,  
>    When his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side;  
>    His looke was sterne, and seemed still to threat  
>    Cruell reuenge, which he in hart did hyde,  
> And on his shield *Sans loy* in bloudie lines was dyde.
>
> When nigh he drew vnto this gentle payre  
>    And saw the Red-crosse, which the knight did beare,  
>    He burnt in fire, and gan eftsoones prepare  
>    Himselfe to battell with his couched speare.  
>    Loth was that other, and did faint through feare,  
>    To taste th'vntryed dint of deadly steele;  
>    But yet his Lady did so well him cheare,  
>    That hope of new good hap he gan to feele;  
> So bent his speare, and spurnd his horse with yron heele.
>
> But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce,  
>    And full of wrath, that with his sharp-head speare  
>    Through vainely crossed shield he quite did pierce,  
>    And had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare,  
>    Through shield and bodie eke he should him beare:  
>    Yet so great was the puissance of his push,  
>    That from his saddle quite he did him beare:  
>    He tombling rudely downe to ground did rush,  
> And from his gored wound a well of bloud did gush.
>
> Dismounting lightly from his loftie steed,  
>    He to him lept, in mind to reaue his life,  
>    And proudly said, Lo there the worthie meed  
>    Of him, that slew *Sansfoy* with bloudie knife;  
>    Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife,  
>    In peace may passen ouer *Lethe* lake,  
>    When morning altars purgd with enemies life,  
>    The blacke infernall *Furies* doen aslake:  
>    Life from *Sansfoy* thou tookst, *Sansloy* shall frõ thee take.
>
> Therewith in haste his helmet gan vnlace,  
>    Till *Vna* cride, O hold that heauie hand,  
>    Deare Sir, what euer that thou be in place:  
>    Enough is, that thy foe doth vanquisht stand  
>    Now at thy mercy: Mercie not withstand:  
>    For he is one the truest knight aliue,  
>    Though conquered now he lie on lowly land,  
>    And whilest him fortune fauourd, faire did thriue  
> In bloudie field: therefore of life him not depriue.
>
> Her piteous words might not abate his rage,  
>    But rudely rending vp his helmet, would  
>    Haue slaine him straight: but when he sees his age,  
>    And hoarie head of *Archimago* old,  
>    His hastie hand he doth amazed hold,  
>    And halfe ashamed, wondred at the sight:  
>    For the old man well knew he, though vntold,  
>    In charmes and magicke to haue wondrous might,  
> Ne euer wont in field, ne in round lists to fight.
>
> And said, Why *Archimago*, lucklesse syre,  
>    What doe I see? what hard mishap is this,  
>    That hath thee hither brought to taste mine yre?  
>    Or thine the fault, or mine the error is,  
>    In stead of foe to wound my friend amis?  
>    He answered nought, but in a traunce still lay,  
>    And on those guilefull dazed eyes of his  
>    The cloud of death did sit. Which doen away,  
> He left him lying so, ne would no lenger stay.
>
> But to the virgin comes, who all this while  
>    Amased stands, her selfe so mockt to see  
>    By him, who has the guerdon of his guile,  
>    For so misfeigning her true knight to bee:  
>    Yet is she now in more perplexitie,  
>    Left in the hand of that same Paynim bold,  
>    From whom her booteth not at all to flie;  
>    Who by her cleanly garment catching hold,  
> Her from her Palfrey pluckt, her visage to behold.
>
> But her fierce seruant full of kingly awe  
>    And high disdaine, whenas his soueraine Dame  
>    So rudely handled by her foe he sawe,  
>    With gaping iawes full greedy at him came,  
>    And ramping on his shield, did weene the same  
>    Haue reft away with his sharpe rending clawes:  
>    But he was stout, and lust did now inflame  
>    His corage more, that frõ his griping pawes  
> He hath his shield redeem'd, and foorth his sword he drawes.
>
> O then too weake and feeble was the forse  
>    Of saluage beast, his puissance to withstand:  
>    For he was strong, and of so mightie corse,  
>    As euer wielded speare in warlike hand,  
>    And feates of armes did wisely vnderstand.  
>    Eftsoones he perced through his chaufed chest  
>    With thrilling point of deadly yron brand,  
>    And launcht his Lordly hart: with death opprest  
> He roar'd aloud, whiles life forsooke his stubborne brest.
>
> Who now is left to keepe the forlorne maid  
>    From raging spoile of lawlesse victors will?  
>    Her faithfull gard remou'd, her hope dismaid,  
>    Her selfe a yeelded pray to saue or spill.  
>    He now Lord of the field, his pride to fill,  
>    With foule reproches, and disdainfull spight  
>    Her vildly entertaines, and will or nill,  
>    Beares her away vpon his courser light:  
> Her prayers nought preuaile, his rage is more of might.
>
> And all the way, with great lamenting paine,  
>    And piteous plaints she filleth his dull eares,  
>    That stony hart could riuen haue in twaine,  
>    And all the way she wets with flowing teares:  
>    But he enrag'd with rancor, nothing heares.  
>    Her seruile beast yet would not leaue her so,  
>    But followes her farre off, ne ought he feares,  
>    To be partaker of her wandring woe,  
> More mild in beastly kind, then that her beastly foe.
