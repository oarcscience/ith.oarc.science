<blockquote> 
<i>Guyon by Archimage abusd,<br>
The Redcrosse knight awaytes,<br>
Findes Mordant and Amauia slaine<br>
With pleasures poisoned baytes.</i><p>
</blockquote> 

 
<p>
<blockquote> 
T
Hat cunning Architect of cancred guile,<br>
Whom Princes late displeasure left in bands,<br>
For falsed letters and suborned wile,<br>
Soone as the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight he vnderstands,<br>
To beene departed out of <i>Eden</i> lands,<br>
To serue againe his soueraine Elfin Queene,<br>
His artes he moues, and out of caytiues hands<br>
Himselfe he frees by secret meanes vnseene;<br>
His shackles emptie left, him selfe escaped cleene.<p>
 
And forth he fares full of malicious mind,<br>
To worken mischiefe and auenging woe,<br>
Where euer he that godly knight may find,<br>
His onely hart sore, and his onely foe,<br>
Sith <i>Vna</i> now he algates must forgoe,<br>
Whom his victorious hands did earst restore<br>
To natiue crowne and kingdome late ygoe:<br>
Where she enioyes sure peace for euermore,<br>
As weather-beaten ship arriu'd on happie shore.<p>
 
Him therefore now the obiect of his spight<br>
And deadly food he makes: him to offend<br>
By forged treason, or by open fight<br>
He seekes, of all his drift the aymed end:<br>
Thereto his subtile engins he does bend<br>
His practick wit, and his faire filed tong,<br>
With thousand other sleights: for well he kend,<br>
His credit now in doubtfull ballaunce hong;<br>
For hardly could be hurt, who was already stong.<p>
 
Still as he went, he craftie stales did lay<br>
With cunning traines him to entrap vnwares.<br>
And priuie spials plast in all his way,<br>
To weete what course he takes, and how he fares;<br>
To ketch him at a vantage in his snares.<br>
But now so wise and warie was the knight<br>
By triall of his former harmes and cares,<br>
That he descride, and shonned still his slight:<br>
The fish that once was caught, new bait will hardly bite.<p>
 
Nath'lesse th'Enchaunter would not spare his paine,<br>
In hope to win occasion to his will;<br>
Which when he long awaited had in vaine,<br>
He chaungd his minde from one to other ill:<br>
For to all good he enimy was still.<br>
Vpon the way him fortuned to meet,<br>
Faire marching vnderneath a shady hill,<br>
A goodly knight, all armd in harnesse meete,<br>
That from his head no place appeared to his feete.<p>
 
His carriage was full comely and vpright,<br>
His countenaunce demure and temperate,<br>
But yet so sterne and terrible in sight,<br>
That cheard his friends, and did his foes amate:<br>
He was an Elfin borne of noble state,<br>
And mickle worship in his natiue land;<br>
Well could he tourney and in lists debate,<br>
And knighthood tooke of good Sir <i>Huons</i> hand,<br>
When with king <i>Oberon</i> he came to Faerie land.<p>
 
Him als accompanyd vpon the way<br>
A comely Palmer, clad in blacke attire,<br>
Of ripest yeares, and haires all hoarie gray,<br>
That with a staffe his feeble steps did stire,<br>
Least his long way his aged limbes should tire:<br>
And if by lookes one may the mind aread,<br>
He seemd to be a sage and sober sire,<br>
And euer with slow pace the knight did lead,<br>
Who taught his trampling steed with equall steps to tread.<p>
 
Such whenas <i>Archimago</i> them did view,<br>
He weened well to worke some vncouth wile,<br>
Eftsoones vntwisting his deceiptfull clew,<br>
He gan to weaue a web of wicked guile,<br>
And with faire countenance and flattring stile,<br>
To them approching, thus the knight bespake:<br>
Faire sonne of <i>Mars</i>, that seeke with warlike spoile.<br>
And great atchieu'ments great your selfe to make,<br>
Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble misers sake.<p>
 
He stayd his steed for humble misers sake,<br>
And bad tell on the tenor of his plaint;<br>
Who feigning then in euery limbe to quake,<br>
Through inward feare, and seeming pale and faint<br>
With piteous mone his percing speach gan paint;<br>
Deare Lady how shall I declare thy cace,<br>
Whom late I left in langourous constraint?<br>
Would God thy selfe now present were in place,<br>
To tell this ruefull tale; thy sight could win thee grace.<p>
 
Or rather would, O would it so had chaunst,<br>
That you, most noble Sir, had present beene,<br>
When that lewd ribauld with vile lust aduaunst<br>
Layd first his filthy hands on virgin cleene,<br>
To spoile her daintie corse so faire and sheene,<br>
As on the earth, great mother of vs all,<br>
With liuing eye more faire was neuer seene,<br>
Of chastitie and honour virginall:<br>
Witnesse ye heau&#7869;s, whom she in vaine to helpe did call.<p>
 
How may it be, (said then the knight halfe wroth,)<br>
That knight should knighthood euer so haue shent?<br>
None but that saw (quoth he) would weene for troth,<br>
How shamefully that Maid he did torment.<br>
Her looser golden lockes he rudely rent,<br>
And drew her on the ground, and his sharpe sword,<br>
Against her snowy brest he fiercely bent,<br>
And threatned death with many a bloudie word;<br>
Toung hates to tell the rest, that eye to see abhord.<p>
 
Therewith amoued from his sober mood,<br>
And liues he yet (said he) that wrought this act,<br>
And doen the heauens afford him vitall food?<br>
He liues, (quoth he) and boasteth of the fact,<br>
Ne yet hath any knight his courage crackt.<br>
Where may that treachour then (said he) be found,<br>
Or by what meanes may I his footing tract?<br>
That shall I shew (said he) as sure, as hound<br>
The strick&#7869; Deare doth chalenge by the bleeding wound.<p>
 
He staid not lenger talke, but with fierce ire<br>
And zealous hast away is quickly gone<br>
To seeke that knight, where him that craftie Squire<br>
Supposd to be. They do arriue anone,<br>
Where sate a gentle Lady all alone,<br>
With garments rent, and haire discheueled,<br>
Wringing her hands, and making piteous mone;<br>
Her swollen eyes were much disfigured,<br>
And her faire face with teares was fowly blubbered.<p>
 
The knight approching nigh thus to her said,<br>
Faire Ladie, through foule sorrow ill bedight,<br>
Great pittie is to see you thus dismaid,<br>
And marre the blossome of your beautie bright:<br>
For thy appease your griefe and heauie plight,<br>
And tell the cause of your conceiued paine.<br>
For if he liue, that hath you doen despight,<br>
He shall you doe due recompence againe,<br>
Or else his wrong with greater puissance maintaine.<p>
 
Which when she heard, as in despightfull wise,<br>
She wilfully her sorrow did augment,<br>
And offred hope of comfort did despise:<br>
Her golden lockes most cruelly she rent,<br>
And scratcht her face with ghastly dreriment,<br>
Ne would she speake, ne see, ne yet be seene,<br>
But hid her visage, and her head downe bent,<br>
Either for grieuous shame, or for great teene,<br>
As if her hart with sorrow had transfixed beene.<p>
 
Till her that Squire bespake, Madame my liefe,<br>
For Gods deare loue be not so wilfull bent,<br>
But doe vouchsafe now to receiue reliefe,<br>
The which good fortune doth to you present.<br>
For what bootes it to weepe and to wayment,<br>
When ill is chaunst, but doth the ill increase,<br>
And the weake mind with double woe torment?<br>
When she her Squire heard speake, she gan appease<br>
Her voluntarie paine, and feele some secret ease.<p>
 
Eftsoone she said, Ah gentle trustie Squire,<br>
What comfort can I wofull wretch conceaue,<br>
Or why should euer I henceforth desire,<br>
To see faire heauens face, and life not leaue,<br>
Sith that false Traytour did my honour reaue?<br>
False traytour certes (said the Faerie knight)<br>
I read the man, that euer would deceaue<br>
A gentle Ladie, or her wrong through might:<br>
Death were too little paine for such a foule despight.<p>
 
But now, faire Ladie, comfort to you make,<br>
And read, who hath ye wrought this shamefull plight.<br>
That short reuenge the man may ouertake,<br>
Where so he be, and soone vpon him light.<br>
Certes (saide she) I wote not how he hight,<br>
But vnder him a gray steede did he wield,<br>
Whose sides with dapled circles weren dight;<br>
Vpright he rode, and in his siluer shield<br>
He bore a bloudie Crosse, that quartred all the field.<p>
 
Now by my head (said <i>Guyon</i>) much I muse,<br>
How that same knight should do so foule amis,<br>
Or euer gentle Damzell so abuse:<br>
For may I boldly say, he surely is<br>
A right good knight, and true of word ywis:<br>
I present was, and can it witnesse well,<br>
When armes he swore, and streight did enterpris<br>
Th'aduenture of the <i>Errant damozell</i>,<br>
In which he hath great glorie wonne, as I heare tell.<p>
 
Nathlesse he shortly shall againe be tryde,<br>
And fairly quite him of th'imputed blame,<br>
Else be ye sure he dearely shall abyde,<br>
Or make you good amendment for the same:<br>
All wrongs haue mends, but no amends of shame.<br>
Now therefore Ladie, rise out of your paine,<br>
And see the saluing of your blotted name.<br>
Full loth she seemd thereto, but yet did faine;<br>
For she was inly glad her purpose so to gaine.<p>
 
Her purpose was not such, as she did faine,<br>
Ne yet her person such, as it was seene,<br>
But vnder simple shew and semblant plaine<br>
Lurckt false <i>Duessa</i> secretly vnseene,<br>
As a chast Virgin, that wronged beene:<br>
So had false <i>Archimago</i> her disguisd,<br>
To cloke her guile with sorrow and sad teene;<br>
And eke himselfe had craftily deuisd<br>
To be her Squire, and do her seruice well aguisd.<p>
 
Her late forlorne and naked he had found,<br>
Where she did wander in waste wildernesse,<br>
Lurking in rockes and caues farre vnder ground,<br>
And with greene mosse cou'ring her nakednesse,<br>
To hide her shame and loathly filthinesse;<br>
Sith her Prince <i>Arthur</i> of proud ornaments<br>
And borrow'd beautie spoyld. Her nathelesse<br>
Th'enchaunter finding fit for his intents,<br>
Did thus reuest, and deckt with due habiliments.<p>
 
For all he did, was to deceiue good knights,<br>
And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame,<br>
To slug in slouth and sensuall delights,<br>
And end their daies with irrenowmed shame.<br>
And now exceeding griefe him ouercame,<br>
To see the <i>Redcrosse</i> thus aduaunced hye;<br>
Therefore this craftie engine he did frame,<br>
Against his praise to stirre vp enmitye<br>
Of such, as vertues like mote vnto him allye.<p>
 
So now he <i>Guyon</i> guides an vncouth way<br>
Through woods &amp; mountaines, till they came at last<br>
Into a pleasant dale, that lowly lay<br>
Betwixt two hils, whose high heads ouerplast,<br>
The valley did with coole shade ouercast,<br>
Through midst thereof a little riuer rold,<br>
By which there sate a knight with helme vnlast,<br>
Himselfe refreshing with the liquid cold,<br>
After his trauell long, and labours manifold.<p>
 
Loe yonder he, cryde <i>Archimage</i> alowd,<br>
That wrought the shamefull fact, which I did shew;<br>
And now he doth himselfe in secret shrowd,<br>
To flie the vengeance for his outrage dew;<br>
But vaine: for ye shall dearely do him rew,<br>
So God ye speed, and send you good successe;<br>
Which we farre off will here abide to vew.<br>
So they him left, inflam'd with wrathfulnesse,<br>
That streight against that knight his speare he did addresse.<p>
 
Who seeing him from farre so fierce to pricke,<br>
His warlike armes about him gan embrace,<br>
And in the rest his readie speare did sticke;<br>
Tho when as still he saw him towards pace,<br>
He gan rencounter him in equall race.<br>
They bene ymet, both readie to affrap,<br>
When suddenly that warriour gan abace<br>
His threatned speare, as if some new mishap<br>
Had him betidde, or hidden daunger did entrap.<p>
 
And cryde, Mercie Sir knight, and mercie Lord,<br>
For mine offence and heedlesse hardiment,<br>
That had almost committed crime abhord,<br>
And with reprochfull shame mine honour shent,<br>
Whiles cursed steele against that badge I bent,<br>
The sacred badge of my Redeemers death,<br>
Which on your shield is set for ornament:<br>
But his fierce foe his steede could stay vneath,<br>
Who prickt with courage kene, did cruell battell breath.<p>
 
But when he heard him speake, streight way he knew<br>
His error, and himselfe inclyning sayd;<br>
Ah deare Sir <i>Guyon</i>, well becommeth you,<br>
But me behoueth rather to vpbrayd,<br>
Whose hastie hand so farre from reason strayd,<br>
That almost it did haynous violence<br>
On that faire image of that heauenly Mayd,<br>
That decks and armes your shield with faire defence:<br>
Your court'sie takes on you anothers due offence.<p>
 
So bene they both attone, and doen vpreare<br>
Their beuers bright, each other for to greete;<br>
Goodly comportance each to other beare,<br>
And entertaine themselues with court'sies meet,<br>
Then said the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight, Now mote I weet,<br>
Sir <i>Guyon</i>, why with so fierce saliaunce,<br>
And fell intent ye did at earst me meet;<br>
For sith I know your goodly gouernaunce,<br>
Great cause, I weene, you guided, or some vncouth chaunce.<p>
 
Certes (said he) well mote I shame to tell<br>
The fond encheason, that me hither led.<br>
A false infamous faitour late befell<br>
Me for to meet, that seemed ill bested,<br>
And playnd of grieuous outrage, which he red<br>
A knight had wrought against a Ladie gent;<br>
Which to auenge, he to this place me led,<br>
Where you he made the marke of his intent,<br>
And now is fled; foule shame him follow, where he went.<p>
 
So can he turne his earnest vnto game,<br>
Through goodly handling and wise temperance.<br>
By this his aged guide in presence came;<br>
Who soone as on that knight his eye did glance,<br>
Eft soones of him had perfect cognizance,<br>
Sith him in Faerie court he late auizd;<br>
And said, Faire sonne, God giue you happie chance,<br>
And that deare Crosse vpon your shield deuizd,<br>
Wherewith aboue all knights ye goodly seeme aguizd.<p>
 
Ioy may you haue, and euerlasting fame,<br>
Of late most hard atchieu'ment by you donne,<br>
For which enrolled is your glorious name<br>
In heauenly Registers aboue the Sunne,<br>
Where you a Saint with Saints your seat haue wonne:<br>
But wretched we, where ye haue left your marke,<br>
Must now anew begin, like race to runne;<br>
God guide thee, <i>Guyon</i>, well to end thy warke,<br>
And to the wished hauen bring thy weary barke.<p>
 
Palmer, (him answered the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight)<br>
His be the praise, that this atchieu'ment wrought,<br>
Who made my hand the organ of his might;<br>
More then goodwill to me attribute nought:<br>
For all I did, I did but as I ought.<br>
But you, faire Sir, whose pageant next ensewes,<br>
Well mote yee thee, as well can wish your thought,<br>
That home ye may report thrise happie newes;<br>
For well ye worthie bene for worth and gentle thewes.<p>
 
So courteous conge both did giue and take,<br>
With right hands plighted, pledges of good will.<br>
Then <i>Guyon</i> forward gan his voyage make,<br>
With his blacke Palmer, that him guided still.<br>
Still he him guided ouer dale and hill,<br>
And with his steedie staffe did point his way:<br>
His race with reason, and with words his will,<br>
From foule intemperance he oft did stay,<br>
And suffred not in wrath his hastie steps to stray.<p>
 
In this faire wize they traueild long yfere,<br>
Through many hard assayes, which did betide;<br>
Of which he honour still away did beare,<br>
And spred his glorie through all countries wide.<br>
At last as chaunst them by a forest side<br>
To passe, for succour from the scorching ray,<br>
They heard a ruefull voice, that dearnly cride<br>
With percing shriekes, and many a dolefull lay;<br>
Which to attend, a while their forward steps they stay.<p>
 
But if that carelesse heauens (quoth she) despise<br>
The doome of iust reuenge, and take delight<br>
To see sad pageants of mens miseries,<br>
As bound by them to liue in liues despight,<br>
Yet can they not warne death from wretched wight.<br>
Come then, come soone, come sweetest death to mee,<br>
And take away this long lent loathed light:<br>
Sharpe by thy wounds, but sweet the medicines bee,<br>
That long captiued soules from wearie thraldome free.<p>
 
But thou, sweet Babe, whom frowning froward fate<br>
Hath made sad witnesse of thy fathers fall,<br>
Sith heauen thee deignes to hold in liuing state,<br>
Long maist thou liue, and better thriue withall,<br>
Then to thy lucklesse parents did befall:<br>
Liue thou, and to thy mother dead attest,<br>
That cleare she dide from blemish criminall;<br>
Thy litle hands embrewd in bleeding brest<br>
Loe I for pledges leaue.  So giue me leaue to rest.<p>
 
With that a deadly shrieke she forth did throw,<br>
That through the wood reecchoed againe,<br>
And after gaue a grone so deepe and low,<br>
That seemd her tender heart was rent in twaine,<br>
Or thrild with point of thorough piercing paine;<br>
As gentle Hynd, whose sides with cruell steele<br>
Through launched, forth her bleeding life does raine,<br>
Whiles the sad pang approching she does feele,<br>
Brayes out her latest breath, and vp her eyes doth seele.<p>
 
Which when that warriour heard, dismounting straict<br>
From his tall steed, he rusht into the thicke,<br>
And soone arriued, where that sad pourtraict<br>
Of death and labour lay, halfe dead, halfe quicke,<br>
In whose white alabaster brest did sticke<br>
A cruell knife, that made a griesly wound,<br>
From which forth gusht a streme of gorebloud thick,<br>
That all her goodly garments staind around,<br>
And into a deepe sanguine dide the grassie ground.<p>
 
Pittifull spectacle of deadly smart,<br>
Beside a bubbling fountaine low she lay,<br>
Which she increased with her bleeding hart,<br>
And the cleane waues with purple gore did ray;<br>
Als in her lap a louely babe did play<br>
His cruell sport, in stead of sorrow dew;<br>
For in her streaming blood he did embay<br>
His litle hands, and tender ioynts embrew;<br>
Pitifull spectacle, as euer eye did view.<p>
 
Besides them both, vpon the soiled gras<br>
The dead corse of an armed knight was spred,<br>
Whose armour all with bloud besprinckled was;<br>
His ruddie lips did smile, and rosy red<br>
Did paint his chearefull cheekes, yet being ded,<br>
Seemd to haue beene a goodly personage,<br>
Now in his freshest flowre of lustie hed,<br>
Fit to inflame faire Lady with loues rage,<br>
But that fiers fate did crop the blossome of his age.<p>
 
Whom when the good Sir <i>Guyon</i> did behold,<br>
His hart gan wexe as starke, as marble stone,<br>
And his fresh bloud did frieze with fearefull cold,<br>
That all his senses seemd bereft attone:<br>
At last his mightie ghost gan deepe to grone,<br>
As Lyon grudging in his great disdaine,<br>
Mournes inwardly, and makes to himselfe mone:<br>
Till ruth and fraile affection did constraine,<br>
His stout courage to stoupe, and shew his inward paine.<p>
 
Out of her gored wound the cruell steele<br>
He lightly snatcht, and did the floudgate stop<br>
With his faire garment: then gan softly feele<br>
Her feeble pulse, to proue if any drop<br>
Of liuing bloud yet in her veynes did hop;<br>
Which when he felt to moue, he hoped faire<br>
To call backe life to her forsaken shop;<br>
So well he did her deadly wounds repaire,<br>
That at the last she gan to breath out liuing aire.<p>
 
Which he perceiuing greatly gan reioice,<br>
And goodly counsell, that for wounded hart<br>
Is meetest med'cine, tempred with sweet voice;<br>
Ay me, deare Lady, which the image art<br>
Of ruefull pitie, and impatient smart,<br>
What direfull chance, armd with reuenging fate,<br>
Or cursed hand hath plaid this cruell part,<br>
Thus fowle to hasten your vntimely date;<br>
Speake, O deare Lady speake: help neuer comes too late.<p>
 
Therewith her dim eie-lids she vp gan reare,<br>
On which the drery death did sit, as sad<br>
As lump of lead, and made darke clouds appeare;<br>
But when as him all in bright armour clad<br>
Before her standing she espied had,<br>
As one out of a deadly dreame affright,<br>
She weakely started, yet she nothing drad:<br>
Streight downe againe her selfe in great despight<br>
She groueling threw to ground, as hating life and light.<p>
 
The gentle knight her soone with carefull paine<br>
Vplifted light, and softly did vphold:<br>
Thrise he her reard, and thrise she sunke againe,<br>
Till he his armes about her sides gan fold,<br>
And to her said; Yet if the stony cold<br>
Haue not all seized on your frozen hart,<br>
Let one word fall that may your griefe vnfold,<br>
And tell the secret of your mortall smart;<br>
He oft finds present helpe, who does his griefe impart.<p>
 
Then casting vp a deadly looke, full low,<br>
Shee sight from bottome of her wounded brest,<br>
And after, many bitter throbs did throw<br>
With lips full pale and foltring tongue opprest,<br>
These words she breathed forth from riuen chest;<br>
Leaue, ah leaue off, what euer wight thou bee,<br>
To let a wearie wretch from her dew rest,<br>
And trouble dying soules tranquilitee.<br>
Take not away now got, which none would giue to me.<p>
 
Ah farre be it (said he) Deare dame fro mee,<br>
To hinder soule from her desired rest,<br>
Or hold sad life in long captiuitee:<br>
For all I seeke, is but to haue redrest<br>
The bitter pangs, that doth your heart infest.<br>
Tell then, &ocirc; Lady tell, what fatall priefe<br>
Hath with so huge misfortune you opprest?<br>
That I may cast to compasse your reliefe,<br>
Or die with you in sorrow, and partake your griefe.<p>
 
With feeble hands then stretched forth on hye,<br>
As heauen accusing guiltie of her death,<br>
And with dry drops congealed in her eye,<br>
In these sad words she spent her vtmost breath:<br>
Heare then, &ocirc; man, the sorrowes that vneath<br>
My tongue can tell, so farre all sense they pas:<br>
Loe this dead corpse, that lies here vnderneath,<br>
The gentlest knight, that euer on greene gras<br>
Gay steed with spurs did pricke, the good Sir <i>Mortdant</i> was.<p>
 
Was, (ay the while, that he is not so now)<br>
My Lord my loue; my deare Lord, my deare loue,<br>
So long as heauens iust with equall brow<br>
Vouchsafed to behold vs from aboue,<br>
One day when him high courage did emmoue,<br>
As wont ye knights to seeke aduentures wilde,<br>
He pricked forth, his puissant force to proue,<br>
Me then he left enwombed of this child,<br>
This lucklesse child, whom thus ye see with bloud defild.<p>
 
Him fortuned (hard fortune ye may ghesse)<br>
To come, where vile <i>Acrasia</i> does wonne,<br>
<i>Acrasia</i> a false enchaunteresse,<br>
That many errant knights hath foule fordonne:<br>
Within a wandring Island, that doth ronne<br>
And stray in perilous gulfe, her dwelling is:<br>
Faire Sir, if euer there ye trauell, shonne<br>
The cursed land where many wend amis,<br>
And know it by the name; it hight the <i>Bowre of blis</i>.<p>
 
Her blisse is all in pleasure and delight,<br>
Wherewith she makes her louers drunken mad,<br>
And then with words &amp; weedes of wondrous might,<br>
On them she workes her will to vses bad:<br>
My lifest Lord she thus beguiled had;<br>
For he was flesh: (all flesh doth frailtie breed.)<br>
Whom when I heard to beene so ill bestad,<br>
Weake wretch I wrapt my selfe in Palmers weed,<br>
And cast to seeke him forth through daunger and great dreed.<p>
 
Now had faire <i>Cynthia</i> by euen tournes<br>
Full measured three quarters of her yeare,<br>
And thrise three times had fild her crooked hornes,<br>
Whenas my wombe her burdein would forbeare,<br>
And bad me call <i>Lucina</i> to me neare.<br>
<i>Lucina</i> came: a manchild forth I brought:<br>
The woods, the Nymphes, my bowres, my midwiues weare,<br>
Hard helpe at need.  So deare thee babe I bought,<br>
Yt nought too deare I deemd, while so my dear I sought.<p>
 
Him so I sought, and so at last I found<br>
Where him that witch had thralled to her will,<br>
In chaines of lust and lewd desires ybound,<br>
And so transformed from his former skill,<br>
That me he knew not, neither his owne ille;<br>
Till through wise handling and faire gouernance,<br>
I him recured to a better will,<br>
Purged from drugs of foule intemperance:<br>
Then meanes I gan deuise for his deliuerance.<p>
 
Which when the vile Enchaunteresse perceiu'd,<br>
How that my Lord from her I would repriue,<br>
With cup thus charmd, him parting she deceiu'd;<br>
<i>Sad verse, giue death to him that death does giue,<br>
And losse of loue, to her that loues to liue,<br>
So soone as Bacchus with the Nymphe does lincke:</i><br>
So parted we and on our iourney driue,<br>
Till comming to this well, he stoupt to drincke:<br>
The charme fulfild, dead suddenly he downe did sincke.<p>
 
Which when I wretch,---Not one word more she sayd<br>
But breaking off, the end for want of breath,<br>
And slyding soft, as downe to sleepe her layd,<br>
And ended all her woe in quiet death.<br>
That seeing good Sir <i>Guyon</i>, could vneath<br>
From teares abstaine, for griefe his hart did grate,<br>
And from so heauie sight his head did wreath,<br>
Accusing fortune, and too cruell fate,<br>
Which plunged had faire Ladie in so wretched state.<p>
 
Then turning to his Palmer said, Old syre<br>
Behold the image of mortalitie,<br>
And feeble nature cloth'd with fleshly tyre,<br>
When raging passion with fierce tyrannie<br>
Robs reason of her due regalitie<br>
And makes it seruant to her basest part:<br>
The strong it weakens with infirmitie,<br>
And with bold furie armes the weakest hart;<br>
The strong through pleasure soonest falles, the weake through
smart.<p>
 
But temperance (said he) with golden squire<br>
Betwixt them both can measure out a meane,<br>
Neither to melt in pleasures whot desire,<br>
Nor fry in hartlesse griefe and dolefull teene.<br>
Thrise happie man, who fares them both atweene:<br>
But sith this wretched woman ouercome<br>
Of anguish, rather then of crime hath beene,<br>
Reserue her cause to her eternall doome,<br>
And in the meane vouchsafe her honorable toombe.<p>
 
Palmer (quoth he) death is an equall doome<br>
To good and bad, the common Inne of rest;<br>
But after death the tryall is to come,<br>
When best shall be to them, that liued best:<br>
But both alike, when death hath both supprest,<br>
Religious reuerence doth buriall teene,<br>
Which who so wants, wants so much of his rest;<br>
For all so great shame after death I weene,<br>
As selfe to dyen bad, vnburied bad to beene.<p>
 
So both agree their bodies to engraue;<br>
The great earthes wombe they open to the sky,<br>
And with sad Cypresse seemely it embraue,<br>
Then couering with a clod their closed eye,<br>
They lay therein those corses tenderly,<br>
And bid them sleepe in euerlasting peace.<br>
But ere they did their vtmost obsequy,<br>
Sir <i>Guyon</i> more affection to increace,<br>
Bynempt a sacred vow, which none should aye releace.<p>
 
The dead knights sword out of his sheath he drew,<br>
With which he cut a locke of all their heare,<br>
Which medling with their bloud and earth, he threw<br>
Into the graue, and gan deuoutly sweare;<br>
Such and such euill God on <i>Guyon</i> reare,<br>
And worse and worse young Orphane be thy paine,<br>
If I or thou dew vengeance doe forbeare,<br>
Till guiltie bloud her guerdon doe obtaine:<br>
So shedding many teares, they closd the earth againe.<p>
