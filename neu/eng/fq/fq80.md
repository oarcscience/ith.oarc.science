*Cant. VII.*

> *Pealing, from* Ioue, *to* Natur's *Bar,*  
> *bold* Alteration *pleades  
> Large Euidence: but* Nature *soone  
> her righteous Doome arades.*

> A H! whither doost thou now thou greater Muse  
> Me from these woods & pleasing forrests bring?  
> And my fraile spirit (that dooth oft refuse  
> This too high flight, vnfit for her weake wing)  
> Lift vp aloft, to tell of heauens King  
> (Thy soueraine Sire) his fortunate successe,  
> And victory, in bigger noates to sing,  
> Which he obtain'd against that *Titanesse*,  
> That him of heauens Empire sought to dispossesse.
>
> Yet sith I needs must follow thy behest,  
> Doe thou my weaker wit with skill inspire,  
> Fit for this turne ; and in my sable brest  
> Kindle fresh sparks of that immortall fire,  
> Which learned minds inflameth with desire  
> Of heauenly things: for, who but thou alone,  
> That art yborne of heauen and heauenly Sire,  
> Can tell things doen in heauen so long ygone:  
> So farre past memory of man that may be knowne.
>
> Now, at the time that was before agreed,  
> The Gods assembled all on *Arlo* hill;  
> As well those that are sprung of heauenly seed,  
> As those that all the other world doe fill,  
> And rule both sea and land vnto their will:  
> Onely th'infernall Powers might not appeare;  
> Aswell for horror of their count'naunce ill,  
> As for th'vnruly fiends which they did feare;  
> Yet *Pluto* and *Proserpina* were present there.
>
> And thither also came all other creatures,  
> What-euer life or motion doe retaine,  
> According to their sundry kinds of features;  
> That *Arlo* scarsly could them all containe;  
> So full they filled euery hill and Plaine:  
> And had not *Natures* Sergeant (that is *Order*)  
> Them well disposed by his busie paine,  
> And raunged farre abroad in euery border,  
> They would haue caused much confusion and disorder.
>
> Then forth issewed (great goddesse) great dame *Nature*,  
> With goodly port and gracious Maiesty;  
> Being far greater and more tall of stature  
> Then any of the gods or Powers on hie:  
> Yet certes by her face and physnomy,  
> Whether she man or woman inly were,  
> That could not any creature well descry:  
> For, with a veile that wimpled euery where,  
> Her head and face was hid, that mote to none appeare
>
> That some doe say was so by skill deuized,  
> To hide the terror of her vncouth hew,  
> From mortall eyes that should be sore agrized;  
> For that her face did like a Lion shew,  
> That eye of wight could not indure to view:  
> But others tell that it so beautious was,  
> And round about such beames of splendor threw,  
> That it the Sunne a thousand times did pass,  
> Ne could be seene, but like an image in a glass.
>
> That well may seemen true: for, well I weene  
> That this same day, when she on *Arlo* sat,  
> Her garment was so bright and wondrous sheene,  
> That my fraile wit cannot deuize to what  
> It to compare, nor finde like stuffe to that,  
> As those three sacred *Saints*, though else most wise,  
> Yet on mount *Thabor* quite their wits forgat,  
> When they their glorious Lord in strange disguise  
> Transfigur'd sawe; his garments so did daze their eyes.
>
> In a fayre Plaine vpon an equall Hill,  
> She placed was in a pauilion;  
> Not such as Craftes-men by their idle skill  
> Are wont for Princes states to fashion:  
> But th'earth her self of her owne motion,  
> Out of her fruitfull bosome made to growe  
> Most dainty trees; that, shooting vp anon,  
> Did seeme to bow their bloosming heads full lowe,  
> For homage vnto her, and like a throne did shew.
>
> So hard it is for any liuing wight,  
> All her array and vestiments to tell,  
> That old *Dan Geffrey* (in whose gentle spright  
> The pure well head of Poesie did dwell)  
> In his *Foules parley* durst not with it mel,  
> But it transferd to *Alane*, who he thought  
> Had in his *Plaint of kindes* describ'd it well:  
> Which who will read set forth so as it ought,  
> Go seek he out that *Alane* where he may be sought.
>
> And all the earth far vnderneath her feete  
> Was dight with flowres, that voluntary grew  
> Out of the ground, and sent forth odours sweet;  
> Tenne thousand mores of sundry sent and hew,  
> That might delight the smell, or please the view:  
> The which, the Nymphes, from all the brooks thereby  
> Had gathered, which they at her foot-stoole threw;  
> That richer seem'd then any tapestry,  
> That Princes bowres adorne with painted imagery.
>
> And *Mole* himselfe, to honour her the more,  
> Did deck himself in freshest faire attire,  
> And his high head, that seemeth alwaies hore  
> With hardned frosts of former winters ire,  
> He with an Oaken girlond now did tire,  
> As if the loue of some new Nymph late seene,  
> Had in him kindled youthfull fresh desire,  
> And made him change his gray attire to greene;  
> Ah gentle *Mole*! such ioyance hath thee well beseene.
>
> Was neuer so great ioyance since the day,  
> That all the gods whylome assembled were,  
> On *Hæmus* hill in their diuine array,  
> To celebrate the solemne bridall cheare,  
> Twixt *Peleus*, and dame *Thetis* pointed there;  
> Where *Phoebus* self, that god of Poets hight,  
> They say did sing the spousall hymne full cleere,  
> That all the gods were rauisht with delight  
> Of his celestiall song, & Musicks wondrous might.
>
> This great Grandmother of all creatures bred  
> Great *Nature*, euer young yet full of eld,  
> Still moouing, yet vnmoued from her sted;  
> Vnseene of any, yet of all beheld;  
> Thus sitting in her throne as I haue teld,  
> Before her came dame *Mutabilitie*;  
> And being lowe before her presence feld,  
> With meek obaysance and humilitie,  
> Thus gan her plaintif Plea, with words to amplifie;
>
> To thee ô greatest goddesse, onely great,  
> An humble suppliant loe, I lowely fly  
> Seeking for Right, which I of thee entreat;  
> Who Right to all dost deale indifferently,  
> Damning all Wrong and tortious Iniurie,  
> Which any of thy creatures doe to other  
> (Oppressing them with power, vnequally)  
> Sith of them all thou art the equall mother,  
> And knittest each to each, as brother vnto brother.
>
> To thee therefore of this same *Ioue* I plaine,  
> And of his fellow gods that faine to be,  
> That challenge to themselues the whole worlds raign;  
> Of which, the greatest part is due to me,  
> And heauen it selfe by heritage in Fee:  
> For, heauen and earth I both alike do deeme,  
> Sith heauen and earth are both alike to thee;  
> And, gods no more then men thou doest esteeme:  
> For, euen the gods to thee, as men to gods do seeme.
>
> Then weigh, ô soueraigne goddesse, by what right  
> These gods do claime the worlds whole souerainty;  
> And that is onely dew vnto thy might  
> Arrogate to themselues ambitiously:  
> As for the gods owne principality,  
> Which *Ioue* vsurpes vniustly; that to be  
> My heritage, *Ioue's* self cannot deny,  
> From my great Grandsire *Titan*, vnto mee,  
> Deriv'd by dew descent; as is well knowen to thee.
>
> Yet mauger *Ioue*, and all his gods beside,  
> I doe possesse the worlds most regiment;  
> As, if ye please it into parts diuide,  
> And euery parts inholders to conuent,  
> Shall to your eyes appeare incontinent.  
> And first, the Earth (great mother of vs all)  
> That only seems vnmov'd and permanent,  
> And vnto *Mutability* not thrall;  
> Yet is she chang'd in part, and eeke in generall.
>
> For, all that from her springs, and is ybredde,  
> How-euer fayre it flourish for a time,  
> Yet see we soone decay; and, being dead  
> To turne again vnto their earthly slime:  
> Yet, out of their decay and mortall crime,  
> We daily see new creatures to arize;  
> And of their Winter spring another Prime,  
> Vnlike in forme, and chang'd by strange disguise:  
> So turne they still about, and change in restlesse wise.
>
> As for her tenants; that is, man and beasts,  
> The beasts we daily see massacred dy,  
> As thralls and vassalls vnto mens beheasts:  
> And men themselues doe change continually,  
> From youth to eld, from wealth to pouerty,  
> From good to bad, from bad to worst of all.  
> Ne doe their bodies only flit and fly:  
> But eeke their minds (which they immortall call)  
> Still change and vary thoughts, as new occasions fall.
>
> Ne is the water in more constant case;  
> Whether those same on high, or these belowe.  
> For, th'Ocean moueth stil, from place to place;  
> And euery Riuer still doth ebbe and flowe:  
> Ne any Lake, that seems most still and slowe,  
> Ne Poole so small, that can his smoothnesse holde,  
> When any winde doth vnder heauen blowe;  
> With which, the clouds are also tost and roll'd;  
> Now like great Hills; &, streight, like sluces, them vnfold.
>
> So likewise are all watry liuing wights  
> Still tost, and turned, with continuall change  
> Neuer abyding in their stedfast plights.  
> The fish, still floting, doe at randon range,  
> And neuer rest; but euermore exchange  
> Their dwelling places, as the streames them carrie:  
> Ne haue the watry foules a certaine grange,  
> Wherein to rest, ne in one stead do tarry;  
> But flitting still doe flie, and still their places vary.
>
> Next is the Ayre: which who feeles not by sense  
> (For, of all sense it is the middle meane)  
> To flit still? and, with subtill influence  
> Of his thin spirit, all creatures to maintaine,  
> In state of life? O weake life! that does leane  
> On thing so tickle as th'vnsteady ayre;  
> Which euery howre is chang'd, and altred cleane  
> With euery blast that bloweth fowle or faire:  
> The faire doth it prolong; the fowle doth it impaire.
>
> Therein the changes infinite beholde,  
> Which to her creatures euery minute chaunce;  
> Now, boyling hot: streight, friezing deadly cold:  
> Now, faire sun-shine, that makes all skip and daunce:  
> Streight, bitter storms and balefull countenance,  
> That makes them all to shiuer and to shake:  
> Rayne, hayle, and snowe do pay them sad penance,  
> And dreadfull thunder-claps (that make them quake)  
> With flames & flashing lights that thousand changes make.
>
> Last is the fire: which, though it liue for euer,  
> Ne can be quenched quite; yet, euery day,  
> Wee see his parts, so soone as they do seuer,  
> To lose their heat, and shortly to decay;  
> So, makes himself his owne consuming pray.  
> Ne any liuing creatures doth he breed:  
> But all, that are of others bredd, doth slay;  
> And, with their death, his cruell life dooth feed;  
> Nought leauing, but their barren ashes, without seede.
>
> Thus, all these fower (the which the ground-work bee  
> Of all the world, and of all liuing wights)  
> To thousand sorts of *Change* we subiect see:  
> Yet are they chang'd (by other wondrous slights)  
> Into themselues, and lose their natiue mights;  
> The Fire to Aire, and th'Ayre to Water sheere,  
> And Water into Earth : yet Water fights  
> With Fire, and Aire with Earth approaching neere:  
> Yet all are in one body, and as one appeare.
>
> So, in them all raignes *Mutabilitie*;  
> How-euer these, that Gods themselues do call,  
> Of them doe claime the rule and souerainty:  
> As, *Vesta*, of the fire æthereall;  
> *Vulcan*, of this, with vs so vsuall;  
> *Ops*, of the earth; and *Iuno* of the Ayre;  
> *Neptune*, of Seas; and Nymphes, of Riuers all.  
> For, all those Riuers to me subiect are:  
> And all the rest, which they vsurp, be all my share.
>
> Which to approuen true, as I haue told,  
> Vouchsafe, ô goddesse, to thy presence call  
> The rest which doe the world in being hold:  
> As, times and seasons of the yeare that fall:  
> Of all the which, demand in generall,  
> Or iudge thy selfe, by verdit of thine eye,  
> Whether to me they are not subiect all.  
> *Nature* did yeeld thereto; and by-and-by,  
> Bade *Order* call them all, before her Maiesty.
>
> So, forth issew'd the Seasons of the yeare;  
> First, lusty *Spring*, all dight in leaues of flowres  
> That freshly budded and new bloosmes did beare  
> (In which a thousand birds had built their bowres  
> That sweetly sung, to call forth Paramours):  
> And in his hand a iauelin he did beare,  
> And on his head (as fit for warlike stoures)  
> A guilt engrauen morion he did weare;  
> That as some did him loue, so others did him feare.
>
> Then came the iolly *Sommer*, being dight  
> In a thin silken cassock coloured greene,  
> That was vnlyned all, to be more light:  
> And on his head a girlond well beseene  
> He wore, from which as he had chauffed been  
> The sweat did drop; and in his hand he bore  
> A boawe and shaftes, as he in forrest greene  
> Had hunted late the Libbard or the Bore,  
> And now would bathe his limbes, with labor heated sore.
>
> Then came the *Autumne* all in yellow clad,  
> As though he ioyed in his plentious store,  
> Laden with fruits that made him laugh, full glad  
> That he had banisht hunger, which to-fore  
> Had by the belly oft him pinched sore.  
> Vpon his head a wreath that was enrold  
> With eares of corne, of euery sort he bore:  
> And in his hand a sickle he did holde,  
> To reape the ripened fruits the which the earth had yold.
>
> Lastly, came *Winter* cloathed all in frize,  
> Chattering his teeth for cold that did him chill,  
> Whil'st on his hoary beard his breath did freese;  
> And the dull drops that from his purpled bill  
> As from a limbeck did adown distill.  
> In his right hand a tipped staffe he held,  
> With which his feeble steps he stayed still:  
> For, he was faint with cold, and weak with eld;  
> That scarse his loosed limbes he hable was to weld.
>
> These, marching softly, thus in order went,  
> And after them, the Monthes all riding came;  
> First, sturdy *March* with brows full sternly bent,  
> And armed strongly, rode vpon a Ram,  
> The same which ouer *Hellespontus* swam:  
> Yet in his hand a spade he also hent,  
> And in a bag all sorts of seeds ysame,  
> Which on the earth he strowed as he went,  
> And fild her womb with fruitfull hope of nourishment.
>
> Next came fresh *Aprill* full of lustyhed,  
> And wanton as a Kid whose horne new buds:  
> Vpon a Bull he rode, the same which led  
> *Europa* floting through th'*Argolick* fluds:  
> His hornes were gilden all with golden studs  
> And garnished with garlonds goodly dight  
> Of all the fairest flowres and freshest buds  
> Which th'earth brings forth, and wet he seem'd in sight  
> With waues, through which he waded for his loues delight.
>
> Then came faire *May*, the fayrest mayd on ground,  
> Deckt all with dainties of her seasons pryde,  
> And throwing flowres out of her lap around:  
> Vpon two brethrens shoulders she did ride,  
> The twinnes of *Leda*; which on eyther side  
> Supported her like to their soueraine Queene.  
> Lord! how all creatures laught, when her they spide,  
> And leapt and daunc't as they had rauisht beene!  
> And *Cupid* selfe about her fluttred all in greene.
>
> And after her, came iolly *Iune*, arrayd  
> All in greene leaues, as he a Player were;  
> Yet in his time, he wrought as well as playd,  
> That by his plough-yrons mote right well appeare:  
> Vpon a Crab he rode, that him did beare  
> With crooked crawling steps an vncouth pase,  
> And backward yode, as Bargemen wont to fare  
> Bending their force contrary to their face,  
> Like that vngracious crew which faines demurest grace.
>
> Then came hot *Iuly* boyling like to fire,  
> That all his garments he had cast away:  
> Vpon a Lyon raging yet with ire  
> He boldly rode and made him to obay:  
> It was the beast that whylome did forray  
> The Nemaean forrest, till th'*Amphytrionide*  
> Him slew, and with his hide did him array;  
> Behinde his back a sithe, and by his side  
> Vnder his belt he bore a sickle circling wide.
>
> The sixt was *August*, being rich arrayd  
> In garment all of gold downe to the ground:  
> Yet rode he not, but led a louely Mayd  
> Forth by the lilly hand, the which was cround  
> With eares of corne, and full her hand was found;  
> That was the righteous Virgin, which of old  
> Liv'd here on earth, and plenty made abound;  
> But, after Wrong was lov'd and Iustice solde,  
> She left th'vnrighteous world and was to heauen extold.
>
> Next him, *September* marched eeke on foote;  
> Yet was he heauy laden with the spoyle  
> Of haruests riches, which he made his boot,  
> And him enricht with bounty of the soyle:  
> In his one hand, as fit for haruests toyle,  
> He held a knife-hook; and in th'other hand  
> A paire of waights, with which he did assoyle  
> Both more and lesse, where it in doubt did stand,  
> And equall gaue to each as Iustice duly scann'd.
>
> Then came *October* full of merry glee:  
> For, yet his noule was totty of the must,  
> Which he was treading in the wine-fats see,  
> And of the ioyous oyle, whose gentle gust  
> Made him so frollick and so full of lust:  
> Vpon a dreadfull Scorpion he did ride,  
> The same which by *Dianaes* doom vniust  
> Slew great *Orion:* and eeke by his side  
> He had his ploughing share, and coulter ready tyde.
>
> Next was *Nouember*, he full grosse and fat,  
> As fed with lard, and that right well might seeme;  
> For, he had been a fatting hogs of late,  
> That yet his browes with sweat, did reek and steem,  
> And yet the season was full sharp and breem;  
> In planting eeke he took no small delight:  
> Whereon he rode, not easie was to deeme;  
> For it a dreadfull *Centaure* was in sight,  
> The seed of *Saturne*, and faire *Nais, Chiron* hight,
>
> And after him, came next the chill *December:*  
> Yet he through merry feasting which he made,  
> And great bonfires, did not the cold remember;  
> His Sauiours birth his mind so much did glad:  
> Vpon a shaggy-bearded Goat he rode,  
> The same wherewith *Dan Ioue* in tender yeares,  
> They say, was nourisht by th'*I\[d\]oean* mayd;  
> And in his hand a broad deepe boawle he beares;  
> Of which, he freely drinks an health to all his peeres.
>
> Then came old *Ianuary*, wrapped well  
> In many weeds to keep the cold away;  
> Yet did he quake and quiuer like to quell,  
> And blowe his nayles to warme them if he may:  
> For, they were numbd with holding all the day  
> An hatchet keene, with which he felled wood,  
> And from the trees did lop the needlesse spray:  
> Vpon an huge great Earth-pot steane he stood;  
> From whose wide mouth, there flowed forth the Romane floud.
>
> And lastly, came cold *February*, sitting  
> In an old wagon, for he could not ride;  
> Drawne of two fishes for the season fitting,  
> Which through the flood before did softly slyde  
> And swim away: yet had he by his side  
> His plough and harnesse fit to till the ground,  
> And tooles to prune the trees, before the pride  
> Of hasting Prime did make them burgein round:  
> So past the twelue Months forth, & their dew places found.
>
> And after these, there came the *Day*, and *Night*,  
> Riding together both with equall pace,  
> Th'one on a Palfrey blacke, the other white;  
> But *Night* had couered her vncomely face  
> With a blacke veile, and held in hand a mace,  
> On top whereof the moon and stars were pight,  
> And sleep and darknesse round about did trace:  
> But *Day* did beare, vpon his scepters hight,  
> The goodly Sun, encompast all with beames bright.
>
> Then came the *Howres*, faire daughters of high *Ioue*,  
> And timely *Night*, the which were all endewed  
> With wondrous beauty fit to kindle loue;  
> But they were Virgins all, and loue eschewed,  
> That might forslack the charge to them fore-shewed  
> By mighty *Ioue*; who did them Porters make  
> Of heauens gate (whence all the gods issued)  
> Which they did dayly watch, and nightly wake  
> By euen turnes, ne euer did their charge forsake.
>
> And after all came *Life*, and lastly *Death*;  
> *Death* with most grim and griesly visage seene,  
> Yet is he nought but parting of the breath;  
> Ne ought to see, but like a shade to weene,  
> Vnbodied, vnsoul'd, vnheard, vnseene.  
> But *Life* was like a faire young lusty boy,  
> Such as they faine *Dan Cupid* to haue beene,  
> Full of delightfull health and liuely ioy.  
> Deckt all with flowres, and wings of gold fit to employ.
>
> When these were past, thus gan the *Titanesse*;  
> Lo, mighty mother, now be iudge and say,  
> Whether in all thy creatures more or lesse  
> *CHANGE* doth not raign & beare the greatest sway:  
> For, who sees not, that *Time* on all doth pray?  
> But *Times* do change and moue continually.  
> So nothing here long standeth in one stay:  
> Wherefore, this lower world who can deny  
> But to be subiect still to *Mutabilitie?*
>
> Then thus gan *Ioue*; Right true it is, that these  
> And all things else that vnder heauen dwell  
> Are chaung'd of *Time*, who doth them all disseise  
> Of being : But, who is it (to me tell)  
> That *Time* himselfe doth moue and still compell  
> To keepe his course? Is not that namely wee  
> Which poure that vertue from our heauenly cell,  
> That moues them all, and makes them changed be?  
> So them we gods doe rule, and in them also thee.
>
> To whom, thus *Mutability*: The things  
> Which we see not how they are mov'd and swayd,  
> Ye may attribute to your selues as Kings,  
> And say they by your secret powre are made:  
> But what we see not, who shall vs perswade?  
> But were they so, as ye them faine to be,  
> Mov'd by your might, and ordred by your ayde;  
> Yet what if I can proue, that euen yee  
> Your selues are likewise chang'd, and subiect vnto mee?
>
> And first, concerning her that is the first,  
> Euen you faire *Cynthia*, whom so much ye make  
> *Ioues* dearest darling, she was bred and nurst  
> On *Cynthus* hill, whence she her name did take:  
> Then is she mortall borne, how-so ye crake;  
> Besides, her face and countenance euery day  
> We changed see, and sundry forms partake,  
> Now hornd, now ro&utild;d, now bright, now brown & gray:  
> So that *as changefull as the Moone* men vse to say.
>
> Next, *Mercury*, who though he lesse appeare  
> To change his hew, and alwayes seeme as one;  
> Yet, he his course doth altar euery yeare,  
> And is of late far out of order gone:  
> So *Venus* eeke, that goodly Paragone,  
> Though faire all night, yet is she darke all day;  
> And *Phoebus* self, who lightsome is alone,  
> Yet is he oft eclipsed by the way,  
> And fills the darkned world with terror and dismay.
>
> Now *Mars* that valiant man is changed most:  
> For, he some times so far runs out of square,  
> That he his way doth seem quite to haue lost,  
> And cleane without his vsuall sphere to fare;  
> That euen these Star-gazers stonisht are  
> At sight thereof, and damne their lying bookes:  
> So likewise, grim Sir *Saturne* oft doth spare  
> His sterne aspect, and calme his crabbed lookes:  
> So many turning cranks these haue, so many crookes.
>
> But you *Dan Ioue*, that only constant are,  
> And King of all the rest, as ye do clame,  
> Are you not subiect eeke to this misfare?  
> Then let me aske you this withouten blame,  
> Where were ye borne? some say in *Crete* by name,  
> Others in *Thebes*, and others other-where;  
> But wheresoeuer they comment the same,  
> They all consent that ye begotten were,  
> And borne here in this world, ne other can appeare.
>
> Then are ye mortall borne, and thrall to me,  
> Vnlesse the kingdome of the sky yee make  
> Immortall, and vnchangeable to bee;  
> Besides, that power and vertue which ye spake,  
> That ye here worke, doth many changes take,  
> And your owne natures change: for, each of you  
> That vertue haue, or this, or that to make,  
> Is checkt and changed from his nature trew,  
> By others opposition or obliquid view.
>
> Besides, the sundry motions of your Spheares,  
> So sundry waies and fashions as clerkes faine,  
> Some in short space, and some in longer yeares;  
> What is the same but alteration plaine?  
> Onely the starrie skie doth still remaine:  
> Yet do the Starres and Signes therein still moue,  
> And euen it self is mov'd, as wizards saine.  
> But all that moueth, doth mutation loue:  
> Therefore both you and them to me I subiect proue.
>
> Then since within this wide great *Vniuerse*  
> Nothing doth firme and permanent appeare,  
> But all things tost and turned by transuerse:  
> What then should let, but I aloft should reare  
> My Trophee, and from all, the triumph beare?  
> Now iudge then (O thou greatest goddesse trew!)  
> According as thy selfe doest see and heare,  
> And vnto me addoom that is my dew;  
> That is the rule of all, all being rul'd by you.
>
> So hauing ended, silence long ensewed,  
> Ne *Nature* to or fro spake for a space,  
> But with firme eyes affixt, the ground still viewed.  
> Meane while, all creatures, looking in her face,  
> Expecting th'end of this so doubtfull case,  
> Did hang in long suspence what would ensew,  
> To whether side should fall the soueraigne place:  
> At length, she looking vp with chearefull view,  
> The silence brake, and gaue her doome in speeches few.
>
> I well consider all that ye haue sayd,  
> And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate  
> And changed be: yet being rightly wayd  
> They are not changed from their first estate;  
> But by their change their being doe dilate:  
> And turning to themselues at length againe,  
> Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate:  
> Then ouer them Change doth not rule and raigne;  
> But they raigne ouer change, and doe their states maintaine.
>
> Cease therefore daughter further to aspire,  
> And thee content thus to be rul'd by me:  
> For thy decay thou seekst by thy desire;  
> But time shall come that all shall changed bee,  
> And from thenceforth, none no more change shall see.  
> So was the *Titaness* put downe and whist,  
> And *Ioue* confirm'd in his imperiall see.  
> Then was that whole assembly quite dismist,  
> And *Natur's* selfe did vanish, whither no man wist.
