*Cant. VIII.*

> *Faire virgin to redeeme her deare  
> brings Arthur to the fight,  
> Who slayes the Gyant, wounds the beast,  
> and strips Duessa quight.*

> AY me, how many perils doe enfold  
> The righteous man, to make him daily fall?  
> Were not, that heauenly grace doth him vphold,  
> And stedfast truth acquite him out of all.  
> Her loue is firme, her care continuall,  
> So oft as he through his owne foolish pride,  
> Or weaknesse is to sinfull bands made thrall:  
> Else should this *Redcrosse* knight in bands haue dyde,  
> For whose deliuerãce she this Prince doth thither guide.
>
> They sadly traueild thus, vntill they came  
> Nigh to a castle builded strong and hie:  
> Then cryde the Dwarfe, lo yonder is the same,  
> In which my Lord my liege doth lucklesse lie,  
> Thrall to that Gyants hatefull tyrannie:  
> Therefore, deare Sir, your mightie powres assay.  
> The noble knight alighted by and by  
> From loftie steede, and bad the Ladie stay,  
> To see what end of fight should him befall that day.
>
> So with the Squire, th'admirer of his might,  
> He marched forth towards that castle wall;  
> Whose gates he found fast shut, ne liuing wight  
> To ward the same, nor answere commers call.  
> Then tooke that Squire an horne of bugle small,  
> Which hong adowne his side in twisted gold,  
> And tassels gay. Wyde wonders ouer all  
> Of that same hornes great vertues weren told,  
> Which had approued bene in vses manifold.
>
> Was neuer wight, that heard that shrilling sound,  
> But trembling feare did feele in euery vaine;  
> Three miles it might be easie heard around,  
> And Ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe:  
> No false enchauntment, nor deceiptfull traine  
> Might once abide the terror of that blast,  
> But presently was voide and wholly vaine:  
> No gate so strong, no locke so firme and fast,  
> But with that percing noise flew open quite, or brast.
>
> The same before the Geants gate he blew,  
> That all the castle quaked from the ground,  
> And euery dore of freewill open flew.  
> The Gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd,  
> Where he with his *Duessa* dalliance fownd,  
> In hast came rushing forth from inner bowre,  
> With staring countenance sterne, as one astownd,  
> And staggering steps, to weet, what suddein stowre  
> Had wrought that horror strange, and dar'd his dreaded powre.
>
> And after him the proud *Duessa* came,  
> High mounted on her manyheaded beast,  
> And euery head with fyrie tongue did flame,  
> And euery head was crowned on his creast,  
> And bloudie mouthed with late cruell feast.  
> That when the knight beheld, his mightie shild  
> Vpon his manly arme he soone addrest,  
> And at him fiercely flew, with courage fild,  
> And eger greedinesse through euery member thrild.
>
> Therewith the Gyant buckled him to fight,  
> Inflam'd with scornefull wrath and high disdaine,  
> And lifting vp his dreadfull club on hight,  
> All arm'd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine,  
> Him thought at first encounter to haue slaine,  
> But wise and warie was that noble Pere,  
> And lightly leaping from so monstrous maine,  
> Did faire auoide the violence him nere;  
> It booted nought, to thinke, such thunderbolts to beare.
>
> Ne shame he thought to shunne so hideous might:  
> The idle stroke, enforcing furious way,  
> Missing the marke of his misaymed sight  
> Did fall to ground, and with his heauie sway  
> So deepely dinted in the driuen clay,  
> That three yardes deepe a furrow vp did throw:  
> The sad earth wounded with so sore assay,  
> Did grone full grieuous vnderneath the blow,  
> And trembling with strange feare, did like an earthquake show.
>
> As when almightie *Ioue* in wrathfull mood,  
> To wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bent,  
> Hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food,  
> Enrold in flames, and smouldring dreriment,  
> Through riuen cloudes and molten firmament;  
> The fierce threeforked engin making way,  
> Both loftie towres and highest trees hath rent,  
> And all that might his angrie passage stay,  
> And shooting in the earth, casts vp a mount of clay.
>
> His boystrous club, so buried in the ground,  
> He could not rearen vp againe so light,  
> But that the knight him at auantage found,  
> And whiles he stroue his combred clubbe to quight  
> Out of the earth, with blade all burning bright  
> He smote off his left arme, which like a blocke  
> Did fall to ground, depriu'd of natiue might;  
> Large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke  
> Forth gushed, like fresh water streame from riuen rocke.
>
> Dismaied with so desperate deadly wound,  
> And eke impatient of vnwonted paine,  
> He loudly brayd with beastly yelling sound,  
> That all the fields rebellowed againe;  
> As great a noyse, as when in Cymbrian plaine  
> An heard of Bulles, whom kindly rage doth sting,  
> Do for the milkie mothers want complaine,  
> And fill the fields with troublous bellowing,  
> The neighbour woods around with hollow murmur ring.
>
> That when his deare *Duessa* heard, and saw  
> The euill stownd, that daungerd her estate,  
> Vnto his aide she hastily did draw  
> Her dreadfull beast, who swolne with bloud of late  
> Came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate,  
> And threatned all his heads like flaming brands.  
> But him the Squire made quickly to retrate,  
> Encountring fierce with single sword in hand,  
> And twixt him and his Lord did like a bulwarke stand.
>
> The proud *Duessa* full of wrathfull spight,  
> And fierce disdaine, to be affronted so,  
> Enforst her purple beast with all her might  
> That stop out of the way to ouerthroe,  
> Scorning the let of so vnequall foe:  
> But nathemore would that courageous swayne  
> To her yeeld passage, gainst his Lord to goe,  
> But with outrageous strokes did him restraine,  
> And with his bodie bard the way atwixt them twaine.
>
> Then tooke the angrie witch her golden cup,  
> Which still she bore, replete with magick artes;  
> Death and despeyre did many thereof sup,  
> And secret poyson through their inner parts,  
> Th'eternall bale of heauie wounded harts;  
> Which after charmes and some enchauntments said,  
> She lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts;  
> Therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd,  
> And all his senses were with suddeine dread dismayd.
>
> So downe he fell before the cruell beast,  
> Who on his necke his bloudie clawes did seize,  
> That life nigh crusht out of his panting brest:  
> No powre he had to stirre, nor will to rize.  
> That when the carefull knight gan well auise,  
> He lightly left the foe, with whom he fought,  
> And to the beast gan turne his enterprise;  
> For wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought,  
> To see his loued Squire into such thraldome brought.
>
> And high aduauncing his bloud-thirstie blade,  
> Stroke one of those deformed heads so sore,  
> That of his puissance proud ensample made;  
> His monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore,  
> And that misformed shape mis-shaped more:  
> A sea of bloud gusht from the gaping wound,  
> That her gay garments staynd with filthy gore,  
> And ouerflowed all the field around;  
> That ouer shoes in bloud he waded on the ground.
>
> Thereat he roared for exceeding paine,  
> That to haue heard, great horror would haue bred,  
> And scourging th'emptie ayre with his long traine,  
> Through great impatience of his grieued hed  
> His gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted  
> Would haue cast downe, and trod in durtie myre,  
> Had not the Gyant soone her succoured;  
> Who all enrag'd with smart and franticke yre,  
> Came hurtling in full fierce, and forst the knight retyre.
>
> The force, which wont in two to be disperst,  
> In one alone left hand he now vnites,  
> Which is through rage more strong then both were erst;  
> With which his hideous club aloft he dites,  
> And at his foe with furious rigour smites,  
> That strongest Oake might seeme to ouerthrow.  
> The stroke vpon his shield so heauie lites,  
> That to the ground it doubleth him full low  
> What mortall wight could euer beare so monstrous blow?
>
> And in his fall his shield, that couered was,  
> Did loose his vele by chaunce, and open flew:  
> The light whereof, that heauens light did pas,  
> Such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw,  
> That eye mote not the same endure to vew.  
> Which when the Gyaunt spyde with staring eye,  
> He downe let fall his arme, and soft withdrew  
> His weapon huge, that heaued was on hye  
> For to haue slaine the man, that on the ground did lye.
>
> And eke the fruitfull-headed beast, amaz'd  
> At flashing beames of that sunshiny shield,  
> Became starke blind, and all his senses daz'd,  
> That downe he tumbled on the durtie field,  
> And seem'd himselfe as conquered to yield.  
> Whom when his maistresse proud perceiu'd to fall,  
> Whiles yet his feeble feet for faintnesse reeld,  
> Vnto the Gyant loudly she gan call,  
> O helpe *Orgoglio*, helpe, or else we perish all.
>
> At her so pitteous cry was much amoou'd  
> Her champion stout, and for to ayde his frend,  
> Againe his wonted angry weapon proou'd:  
> But all in vaine: for he has read his end  
> In that bright shield, and all their forces spend  
> Themselues in vaine: for since that glauncing sight,  
> He hath no powre to hurt, nor to defend;  
> As where th'Almighties lightning brond does light,  
> It dimmes the dazed eyen, and daunts the senses quight.
>
> Whom when the Prince, to battell new addrest,  
> And threatning high his dreadfull stroke did see,  
> His sparkling blade about his head he blest,  
> And smote off quite his right leg by the knee,  
> That downe he tombled; as an aged tree,  
> High growing on the top of rocky clift,  
> Whose hartstrings with keene steele nigh hewen be,  
> The mightie trunck halfe rent, with ragged rift  
> Doth roll adowne the rocks, and fall with fearefull drift.
>
> Or as a Castle reared high and round,  
> By subtile engins and malitious slight  
> Is vndermined from the lowest ground  
> And her foundation forst, and feebled quight,  
> At last downe falles, and with her heaped hight  
> Her hastie ruine does more heauie make,  
> And yields it selfe vnto the victours might;  
> Such was this Gyaunts fall, that seemd to shake  
> The stedfast globe of earth, as it for feare did quake.
>
> The knight then lightly leaping to the pray,  
> With mortall steele him smot againe so sore,  
> That headlesse his vnweldy bodie lay,  
> All wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore,  
> Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store,  
> But soone as breath out of his breast did pas,  
> That huge great body, which the Gyaunt bore,  
> Was vanisht quite, and of that monstrous mas  
> Was nothing left, but like an emptie bladder was.
>
> Whose grieuous fall, when false *Duessa* spide,  
> Her golden cup she cast vnto the ground,  
> And crowned mitre rudely threw aside;  
> Such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound,  
> That she could not endure that dolefull stound,  
> But leauing all behind her, fled away:  
> The light-foot Squire her quickly turnd around,  
> And by hard meanes enforcing her to stay,  
> So brought vnto his Lord, as his deserued pray.
>
> The royall Virgin, which beheld from farre,  
> In pensiue plight, and sad perplexitie,  
> The whole atchieuement of this doubtfull warre,  
> Came running fast to greet his victorie,  
> With sober gladnesse, and myld modestie,  
> And with sweet ioyous cheare him thus bespake;  
> Faire braunch of noblesse, flowre of cheualrie,  
> That with your worth the world amazed make,  
> How shall I quite the paines, ye suffer for my sake?
>
> And you fresh bud of vertue springing fast,  
> Whom these sad eyes saw nigh vnto deaths dore,  
> What hath poore Virgin for such perill past,  
> Wherewith you to reward? Accept therefore  
> My simple selfe, and seruice euermore;  
> And he that high does sit, and all things see  
> With equall eyes, their merites to restore,  
> Behold what ye this day haue done for mee,  
> And what I cannot quite, requite with vsuree.
>
> But sith the heauens, and your faire handeling  
> Haue made you maister of the field this day,  
> Your fortune maister eke with gouerning,  
> And well begun end all so well, I pray,  
> Ne let that wicked woman scape away;  
> For she it is, that did my Lord bethrall,  
> My dearest Lord, and deepe in dongeon lay,  
> Where he his better dayes hath wasted all.  
> O heare, how piteous he to you for ayd does call.
>
> Forthwith he gaue in charge vnto his Squire,  
> That scarlot whore to keepen carefully;  
> Whiles he himselfe with greedie great desire  
> Into the Castle entred forcibly,  
> Where liuing creature none he did espye;  
> Then gan he lowdly through the house to call:  
> But no man car'd to answere to his crye.  
> There raignd a solemne silence ouer all,  
> Nor voice was heard, nor wight was seene in bowre or hall.
>
> At last with creeping crooked pace forth came  
> An old old man, with beard as white as snow,  
> That on a staffe his feeble steps did frame,  
> And guide his wearie gate both too and fro:  
> For his eye sight him failed long ygo,  
> And on his arme a bounch of keyes he bore,  
> The which vnused rust did ouergrow:  
> Those were the keyes of euery inner dore,  
> But he could not them vse, but kept them still in store.
>
> But very vncouth sight was to behold,  
> How he did fashion his vntoward pace,  
> For as he forward moou'd his footing old,  
> So backward still was turnd his wrincled face,  
> Vnlike to men, who euer as they trace,  
> Both feet and face one way are wont to lead.  
> This was the auncient keeper of that place,  
> And foster father of the Gyant dead;  
> His name *Ignaro* did his nature right aread.
>
> His reuerend haires and holy grauitie  
> The knight much honord, as beseemed well,  
> And gently askt, where all the people bee,  
> Which in that stately building wont to dwell.  
> Who answerd him full soft, he could not tell.  
> Againe he askt, where that same knight was layd,  
> Whom great *Orgoglio* with his puissaunce fell  
> Had made his caytiue thrall; againe he sayde,  
> He could not tell: ne euer other answere made.
>
> Then asked he, which way he in might pas:  
> He could not tell, againe he answered.  
> Thereat the curteous knight displeased was,  
> And said, Old sire, it seemes thou hast not red  
> How ill it sits with that same siluer hed  
> In vaine to mocke, or mockt in vaine to bee:  
> But if thou be, as thou art pourtrahed  
> With natures pen, in ages graue degree,  
> Aread in grauer wise, what I demaund of thee.
>
> His answere likewise was, he could not tell.  
> Whose senceless speach, and doted ignorance  
> When as the noble Prince had marked well,  
> He ghest his nature by his countenance,  
> And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance.  
> Then to him stepping, from his arme did reach  
> Those keyes, and made himselfe free enterance.  
> Each dore he opened without any breach;  
> There was no barre to stop, nor foe him to empeach.
>
> There all within full rich arayd he found,  
> With royall arras and resplendent gold.  
> And did with store of euery thing abound,  
> That greatest Princes presence might behold.  
> But all the floore (too filthy to be told)  
> With bloud of guiltlesse babes, and innocents trew,  
> Which there were slaine, as sheepe out of the fold,  
> Defiled was, that dreadfull was to vew,  
> And sacred ashes ouer it was strowed new.
>
> And there beside of marble stone was built  
> An Altare, caru'd with cunning imagery,  
> On which true Christians bloud was often spilt,  
> And holy Martyrs often doen to dye,  
> With cruell malice and strong tyranny:  
> Whose blessed sprites from vnderneath the stone  
> To God for vengeance cryde continually,  
> And with great griefe were often heard to grone,  
> That hardest heart would bleede, to heare their piteous mone.
>
> Through euery rowme he sought, and euery bowr,  
> But no where could he find that wofull thrall:  
> At last he came vnto an yron doore,  
> That fast was lockt, but key found not at all  
> Emongst that bounch, to open it withall;  
> But in the same a little grate was pight,  
> Through which he sent his voyce, and lowd did call  
> With all his powre, to weet, if liuing wight  
> Were housed therewithin, whom he enlargen might.
>
> Therewith an hollow, dreary, murmuring voyce  
> These piteous plaints and dolours did resound;  
> O who is that, which brings me happy choyce  
> Of death, that here lye dying euery stound,  
> Yet liue perforce in balefull darkenesse bound?  
> For now three Moones haue chãged thrice their hew,  
> And haue beene thrice hid vnderneath the ground,  
> Since I the heauens chearefull face did vew,  
> O welcome thou, that doest of death bring tydings trew.
>
> Which when that Champion heard, with percing point  
> Of pitty deare his hart was thrilled sore,  
> And trembling horrour ran through euery ioynt,  
> For ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore:  
> Which shaking off, he rent that yron dore,  
> With furious force, and indignation fell;  
> Where entred in, his foot could find no flore,  
> But all a deepe descent, as darke as hell,  
> That breathed euer forth a filthie banefull smell.
>
> But neither darkenesse fowle, nor filthy bands,  
> Nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold,  
> (Entire affection hateth nicer hands)  
> But that with constant zeale, and courage bold,  
> After long paines and labours manifold,  
> He found the meanes that Prisoner vp to reare;  
> Whose feeble thighes, vnhable to vphold  
> His pined corse, him scarse to light could beare,  
> A ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere.
>
> His sad dull eyes deepe sunck in hollow pits,  
> Could not endure th'vnwonted sunne to view;  
> His bare thin cheekes for want of better bits,  
> And empty sides deceiued of their dew,  
> Could make a stony hart his hap to rew;  
> His rawbone armes, whose mighty brawned bowrs  
> Were wont to riue steele plates, and helmets hew,  
> Were cleane consum'd, and all his vitall powres  
> Decayd, and all his flesh shronk vp like withered flowres.
>
> Whom when his Lady saw, to him she ran  
> With hasty ioy: to see him made her glad,  
> And sad to view his visage pale and wan,  
> Who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad.  
> Tho when her well of teares she wasted had,  
> She said, Ah dearest Lord, what euill starre  
> On you hath fround, and pourd his influence bad,  
> That of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre,  
> And this misseeming hew your manly looks doth marre?
>
> But welcome now my Lord, in wele or woe,  
> Whose presence I haue lackt too long a day;  
> And fie on Fortune mine auowed foe,  
> Whose wrathfull wreakes them selues do now alay.  
> And for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay  
> Of treble good: good growes of euils priefe.  
> The chearelesse man, whom sorrow did dismay,  
> Had no delight to treaten of his griefe;  
> His long endured famine needed more reliefe.
>
> Faire Lady, then said that victorious knight,  
> The things, that grieuous were to do, or beare,  
> Them to renew, I wote, breeds no delight:  
> Best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare:  
> But th'onely good, that growes of passed feare,  
> Is to be wise, and ware of like agein.  
> This dayes ensample hath this lesson deare  
> Deepe written in my heart with yron pen,  
> That blisse may not abide in state of mortall men.
>
> Henceforth sir knight, take to you wonted strength,  
> And maister these mishaps with patient might;  
> Loe where your foe lyes stretcht in monstrous length,  
> And loe that wicked woman in your sight,  
> The roote of all your care, and wretched plight,  
> Now in your powre, to let her liue, or dye.  
> To do her dye (quoth *Vna*) were despight,  
> And shame t'auenge so weake an enimy;  
> But spoile her of her scarlot robe, and let her fly.
>
> So as she bad, that witch they disaraid,  
> And robd of royall robes, and purple pall,  
> And ornaments that richly were displaid;  
> Ne spared they to strip her naked all.  
> Then when they had despoild her tire and call,  
> Such as she was, their eyes might her behold,  
> That her misshaped parts did them appall,  
> A loathly, wrinckled hag, ill fauoured, old,  
> Whose secret filth good manners biddeth not be told.
>
> Her craftie head was altogether bald,  
> And as in hate of honorable eld,  
> Was ouergrowne with scurfe and filthy scald;  
> Her teeth out of her rotten gummes were feld,  
> And her sowre breath abhominably smeld;  
> Her dried dugs, like bladders lacking wind,  
> Hong downe, and filthy matter from them weld;  
> Her wrizled skin as rough, as maple rind,  
> So scabby was, that would haue loathd all womankind.
>
> Her neather parts, the shame of all her kind,  
> My chaster Muse for shame doth blush to write;  
> But at her rompe she growing had behind  
> A foxes taile, with dong all fowly dight;  
> And eke her feete most monstrous were in sight;  
> For one of them was like an Eagles claw,  
> With griping talaunts armd to greedy fight,  
> The other like a Beares vneuen paw:  
> More vgly shape yet neuer liuing creature saw.
>
> Which when the knights beheld, amazd they were,  
> And wondred at so fowle deformed wight.  
> Such then (said *Vna*) as she seemeth here,  
> Such is the face of falshood, such the sight  
> Of fowle *Duessa*, when her borrowed light  
> Is laid away, and counterfesaunce knowne.  
> Thus when they had the witch disrobed quight,  
> And all her filthy feature open showne,  
> They let her goe at will, and wander wayes vnknowne.
>
> She flying fast from heauens hated face,  
> And from the world that her discouered wide,  
> Fled to the wastfull wildernesse apace,  
> From liuing eyes her open shame to hide,  
> And lurkt in rocks and caues long vnespide.  
> But that faire crew of knights, and *Vna* faire  
> Did in that castle afterwards abide,  
> To rest them selues, and weary powres repaire,  
> Where store they found of all, that dainty was and rare.

*Cant. IX.*

> *His loues and lignage Arthur tells  
> The knights knit friendly bands:  
> Sir Treuisan flies from Despayre,  
> Whom Redcrosse knight withstands.*

> O Goodly golden chaine, wherewith yfere  
> The vertues linked are in louely wize:  
> And noble minds of yore allyed were,  
> In braue poursuit of cheualrous emprize,  
> That none did others safety despize,  
> Nor aid enuy to him, in need that stands,  
> But friendly each did others prayse deuize  
> How to aduaunce with fauourable hands,  
> As this good Prince redeemd the *Redcrosse* knight from bands.

> Who when their powres, empaird through labour long,

> And that weake captiue wight now wexed strong,  
> Them list no lenger there at leasure dwell,  
> But forward fare, as their aduentures fell,  
> But ere they parted, *Vna* faire besought  
> That straunger knight his name and nation tell;  
> Least so great good, as he for her had wrought,  
> Should die vnknown, & buried be in thanklesse thought.
>
> Faire virgin (said the Prince) ye me require  
> A thing without the compas of my wit:  
> For both the lignage and the certain Sire,  
> From which I sprong, from me are hidden yit.  
> For all so soone as life did me admit  
> Into this world, and shewed heauens light,  
> From mothers pap I taken was vnfit:

> For-wearied with my sports, I did alight

> When I awoke, and found her place deuoyd,

> True Loues are oftẽ sown, but seldom grow on ground.
>
> Thine, O then, said the gentle *Redcrosse* knight,  
> Next to that Ladies loue, shalbe the place,  
> O fairest virgin, full of heauenly light,  
> Whose wondrous faith, exceeding earthly race,  
> Was firmest fixt in mine extremest case,  
> And you, my Lord, the Patrone of my life,  
> Of that great Queene may well gaine worthy grace:  
> For onely worthy you through prowes priefe

>
> So diuersly discoursing of their loues,  
> The golden Sunne his glistring head gan shew,

> And eke as pledges firme, right hands together ioynd.
>
> Prince *Arthur* gaue a boxe of Diamond sure,  
> Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament,  
> Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure,  
> Of wondrous worth, and vertue excellent,  
> That any wound could heale incontinent:  
> Which to requite, the *Redcrosse* knight him gaue  
> A booke, wherein his Saueours testament

>
> Thus beene they parted, *Arthur* on his way  
> To seeke his loue, and th'other for to fight  
> With *Vnaes* foe, that all her realme did pray.  
> But she now weighing the decayed plight,

> Would not a while her forward course pursew,  
> Ne bring him forth in face of dreadfull fight,  
> Till he recouered had his former hew:

> So as they traueild, lo they gan espy  
> An armed knight towards them gallop fast,  
> That seemed from some feared foe to fly,  
> Or other griesly thing, that him agast.  
> Still as he fled, his eye was backward cast,  
> As if his feare still followed him behind;  
> Als flew his steed, as he his bands had brast,  
> And with his winged heeles did tread the wind,  
> As he had beene a fole of *Pegasus* his kind.
>
> Nigh as he drew, they might perceiue his head

> But he of rope or armes has now no memoree.
>
> The *Redcrosse* knight toward him crossed fast,  
> To weet, what mister wight was so dismayd:

> Sir knight, aread who hath ye thus arayd,  
> And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight:  
> For neuer knight I saw in such misseeming plight.
>
> He answerd nought at all, but adding new  
> Feare to his first amazment, staring wide  
> With stony eyes, and hartlesse hollow hew,  
> Astonisht stood, as one that had aspide

> Him yet againe, and yet againe bespake  
> The gentle knight; who nought to him replide,  
> But trembling euery ioynt did inly quake,  
> And foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake.
>
> For Gods deare loue, Sir knight, do me not stay;  
> For loe he comes, he comes fast after mee.  
> Eft looking backe would faine haue runne away;  
> But he him forst to stay, and tellen free  
> The secret cause of his perplexitie:  
> Yet nathemore by his bold hartie speach,  
> Could his bloud-frosen hart emboldned bee,  
> But through his boldnesse rather feare did reach,  
> Yet forst, at last he made through silence suddein breach.
>
> And am I now in safetie sure (quoth he)  
> From him, that would haue forced me to dye?  
> And is the point of death now turnd fro mee,  
> That I may tell this haplesse history?  
> Feare nought: (quoth he) no daunger now is nye?

> (Said he) the which with this vnlucky eye  
> I late beheld, and had not greater grace  
> Me reft from it, had bene partaker of the place.
>
> I lately chaunst (Would I had neuer chaunst)  
> With a faire knight to keepen companee,  
> Sir *Terwin* hight, that well himselfe aduaunst  
> In all affaires, and was both bold and free,  
> But not so happie as mote happie bee:  
> He lou'd, as was his lot, a Ladie gent,  
> That him againe lou'd in the least degree:  
> For she was proud, and of too high intent,  
> And ioyd to see her louer languish and lament.
>
> From whom returning sad and comfortlesse,  
> As on the way together we did fare,  
> We met that villen (God from him me blesse)  
> That cursed wight, from whom I scapt whyleare,  
> A man of hell, that cals himselfe *Despaire*:  
> Who first vs greets, and after faire areedes  
> Of tydings strange, and of aduentures rare:  
> So creeping close, as Snake in hidden weedes,  
> Inquireth of our states, and of our knightly deedes.
>
> Which when he knew, and felt ourfeeble harts  
> Embost with bale, and bitter byting griefe,  
> Which loue had launched with his deadly darts,  
> With wounding words and termes of foule repriefe  
> He pluckt from vs all hope of due reliefe,  
> That earst vs held in loue of lingring life;  
> Then hopelesse hartlesse, gan the cunning thiefe  
> Perswade vs die, to stint all further strife:  
> To me he lent this rope, to him a rustie knife.
>
> With which sad instrument of hastie death,  
> That wofull louer, loathing lenger light,  
> A wide way made to let forth liuing breath.  
> But I more fearefull, or more luckie wight,  
> Dismayd with that deformed dismall sight,  
> Fled fast away, halfe dead with dying feare:  
> Ne yet assur'd of life by you, Sir knight,  
> Whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare:  
> But God you neuer let his charmed speeches heare.
>
> How may a man (said he) with idle speach  
> Be wonne, to spoyle the Castle of his health?  
> I wote (quoth he) whom triall late did teach,  
> That like would not for all this worldes wealth:

> That ere one be aware, by secret stealth  
> His powre is reft, and weaknesse doth remaine.  
> O neuer Sir desire to try his guilefull traine.
>
> Certes (said he) hence shall I neuer rest,  
> Till I that treachours art haue heard and tride;  
> And you Sir knight, whose name mote I request,  
> Of grace do me vnto his cabin guide.  
> I that hight *Treuisan* (quoth he) will ride  
> Against my liking backe, to doe you grace:  
> But nor for gold nor glee will I abide  
> By you, when ye arriue in that same place;  
> For leuer had I die, then see his deadly face.
>
> Ere long they come, where that same wicked wight  
> His dwelling has, low in an hollow caue,  
> Farre vnderneath a craggie clift ypight,  
> Darke, dolefull, drearie, like a greedie graue,  
> That still for carrion carcases doth craue:  
> On top whereof aye dwelt the ghastly Owle,  
> Shrieking his balefull note, which euer draue  
> Farre from that haunt all other chearefull fowle;  
> And all about it wandring ghostes did waile and howle.
>
> And all about old stockes and stubs of trees,  
> Whereon nor fruit, nor leafe was euer seene,  
> Did hang vpon the ragged rocky knees;  
> On which had many wretches hanged beene,  
> Whose carcases were scattered on the greene,  
> And throwne about the cliffs. Arriued there,  
> That bare-head knight for dread and dolefull teene,  
> Would faine haue fled, ne durst approchen neare,  
> But th'other forst him stay, and comforted in feare.
>
> That darkesome caue they enter, where they find  
> That cursed man, low sitting on the ground,  
> Musing full sadly in his sullein mind;  
> His griesie lockes, long growen, and vnbound,  
> Disordred hong about his shoulders round,  
> And hid his face; through which his hollow eyne  
> Lookt deadly dull, and stared as astound;  
> His raw-bone cheekes through penurie and pine,  
> Were shronke into his iawes, as he did neuer dine.
>
> His garment nought but many ragged clouts,  
> With thornes together pind and patched was,  
> The which his naked sides he wrapt abouts;  
> And him beside there lay vpon the gras  
> A drearie corse, whose life away did pas,  
> All wallowd in his owne yet luke-warme blood,  
> That from his wound yet welled fresh alas;  
> In which a rustie knife fast fixed stood,  
> And made an open passage for the gushing flood.
>
> Which piteous spectacle, approuing trew  
> The wofull tale that *Treuisan* had told,  
> When as the gentle *Redcrosse* knight did vew,  
> With firie zeale he burnt in courage bold,  
> Him to auenge, before his bloud were cold,  
> And to the villein said, Thou damned wight,  
> The author of this fact, we here behold,  
> What iustice can but iudge against thee right,  
> With thine owne bloud to price his bloud, here shed in sight.
>
> What franticke fit (quoth he) hath thus distraught  
> Thee, foolish man, so rash a doome to giue?  
> What iustice euer other iudgement taught,  
> But he should die, who merites not to liue?  
> None else to death this man despayring driue,  
> But his owne guiltie mind deseruing death.  
> Is then vniust to each his due to giue?  
> Or let him die, that loatheth liuing breath?  
> Or let him die at ease, that liueth here vneath?
>
> Who trauels by the wearie wandring way,  
> To come vnto his wished home in haste,  
> And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay,  
> Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,  
> Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?  
> Most enuious man, that grieues at neighbours good,  
> And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,  
> Why wilt not let him passe, that long hath stood  
> Vpon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?
>
> He there does now enioy eternall rest  
> And happie ease, which thou doest want and craue,  
> And further from it daily wanderest:  
> What if some litle paine the passage haue,  
> That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?  
> Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,  
> And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue?  
> Sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas,  
> Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.
>
> The knight much wondred at his suddeine wit,  
> And said, The terme of life is limited,  
> Ne may a man prolong, nor shorten it;  
> The souldier may not moue from watchfull sted,  
> Nor leaue his stand, vntill his Captaine bed.  
> Who life did limit by almightie doome,  
> (Quoth he) knowes best the termes established;  
> And he, that points the Centonell his roome,  
> Doth license him depart at sound of morning droome.
>
> Is not his deed, what euer thing is donne,  
> In heauen and earth? did not he all create  
> To die againe? all ends that was begonne.  
> Their times in his eternall booke of fate  
> Are written sure, and haue their certaine date.  
> Who then can striue with strong necessitie,  
> That holds the world in his still chaunging state,  
> Or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie?  
> Whẽ houre of death is come, let none aske whence, nor why.
>
> The lenger life, I wote the greater sin,  
> The greater sin, the greater punishment:  
> All those great battels, which thou boasts to win,  
> Through strife, and bloud-shed, and auengement,  
> Now praysd, hereafter deare thou shalt repent:  
> For life must life, and bloud must bloud repay.  
> Is not enough thy euill life forespent?  
> For he, that once hath missed the right way,  
> The further he doth goe, the further he doth stray.
>
> Then do no further goe, no further stray,  
> But here lie downe, and to thy rest betake,  
> Th'ill to preuent, that life ensewen may.  
> For what hath life, that may it loued make,  
> And giues not rather cause it to forsake?  
> Feare, sicknesse, age, losse, labour, sorrow, strife,  
> Paine, hunger, cold, that makes the hart to quake;  
> And euer fickle fortune rageth rife,  
> All which, and thousands mo do make a loathsome life.
>
> Thou wretched man, of death hast greatest need,  
> If in true ballance thou wilt weigh thy state:  
> For neuer knight, that dared warlike deede,  
> More lucklesse disauentures did amate:  
> Witnesse the dongeon deepe, wherein of late

> And though good lucke prolonged hath thy date,  
> Yet death then, would the like mishaps forestall,  
> Into the which hereafter thou maiest happen fall.
>
> Why then doest thou, ô man of sin, desire  
> To draw thy dayes forth to their last degree?  
> Is not the measure of thy sinfull hire  
> High heaped vp with huge iniquitie,  
> Against the day of wrath, to burden thee?  
> Is not enough, that to this Ladie milde  
> Thou falsed hast thy faith with periurie,  
> And sold thy selfe to serue *Duessa* vilde,  
> With whom in all abuse thou hast thy selfe defilde?
>
> Is not he iust, that all this doth behold  
> From highest heauen, and beares an equall eye?  
> Shall he thy sins vp in his knowledge fold,  
> And guiltie be of thine impietie?  
> Is not his law, Let euery sinner die:  
> Die shall all flesh? what then must needs be donne,  
> Is it not better to doe willinglie,  
> Then linger, till the glasse be all out ronne?  
> Death is the end of woes: die soone, O faeries sonne.
>
> The knight was much enmoued with his speach,  
> That as a swords point through his hart did perse,  
> And in his conscience made a secret breach,  
> Well knowing true all, that he did reherse,  
> And to his fresh remembrance did reuerse  
> The vgly vew of his deformed crimes,  
> That all his manly powres it did disperse,  
> As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes,  
> That oftentimes he quakt, and fainted oftentimes.
>
> In which amazement, when the Miscreant  
> Perceiued him to wauer weake and fraile,  
> Whiles trembling horror did his conscience dant,  
> And hellish anguish did his soule assaile,  
> To driue him to despaire, and quite to quaile,  
> He shew'd him painted in a table plaine,  
> The damned ghosts, that doe in torments waile,  
> And thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine  
> With fire and brimstone, which for euer shall remaine.
>
> The sight whereof so throughly him dismaid,  
> That nought but death before his eyes he saw,  
> And euer burning wrath before him laid,  
> By righteous sentence of th'Almighties law:  
> Then gan the villein him to ouercraw,  
> And brought vnto him swords, ropes, poison, fire,  
> And all that might him to perdition draw;  
> And bad him choose, what death he would desire:  
> For death was due to him, that had prouokt Gods ire.
>
> But when as none of them he saw him take,  
> He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene,  
> And gaue it him in hand: his hand did quake,  
> And tremble like a leafe of Aspin greene,  
> And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene  
> To come, and goe with tydings from the hart,  
> As it a running messenger had beene.  
> At last resolu'd to worke his finall smart,  
> He lifted vp his hand, that backe againe did start.
>
> Which when as *Vna* saw, through euery vaine  
> The crudled cold ran to her well of life,  
> As in a swowne: but soone reliu'd againe,  
> Out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife,  
> And threw it to the ground, enraged rife,  
> And to him said, Fie, fie, faint harted knight,  
> What meanest thou by this reprochfull strife?  
> Is this the battell, which thou vauntst to fight  
> With that fire-mouthed Dragon, horrible and bright?
>
> Come, come away, fraile, seely, fleshly wight,  
> Ne let vaine words bewitch thy manly hart,  
> Ne diuelish thoughts dismay thy constant spright.  
> In heauenly mercies hast thou not a part?  
> Why shouldst thou then despeire, that chosen art?  
> Where iustice growes, there grows eke greater grace,  
> The which doth quench the brond of hellish smart,  
> And that accurst hand-writing doth deface,  
> Arise, Sir knight arise, and leaue this cursed place.
>
> So vp he rose, and thence amounted streight.  
> Which when the carle beheld, and saw his guest  
> Would safe depart, for all his subtill sleight,  
> He chose an halter from among the rest,  
> And with it hung himselfe, vnbid vnblest.  
> But death he could not worke himselfe thereby;  
> For thousand times he so himselfe had drest,  
> Yet nathelesse it could not doe him die,  
> Till he should die his last, that is eternally.
