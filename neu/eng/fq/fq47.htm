<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>The gentle Squire recouers grace,<br>
Sclaunder her guests doth staine:<br>
Corflambo chaseth Placidas,<br>
And is by Arthure slaine.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
W
Ell said the wiseman, now prou'd true by this,<br>
Which to this gentle Squire did happen late.<br>
That the displeasure of the mighty is<br>
Then death it selfe more dread and desperate.<br>
For naught the same may calme ne mitigate,<br>
Till time the tempest doe thereof delay<br>
With sufferaunce soft, which rigour can abate,<br>
And haue the sterne remembrance wypt away<br>
Of bitter thoughts, which deepe therein infixed lay.<p>

Like as it fell to this vnhappy boy,<br>
Whose tender heart the faire <i>Belphebe</i> had,<br>
With one sterne looke so daunted, that no ioy<br>
In all his life, which afterwards he lad,<br>
He euer tasted, but with penaunce sad<br>
And pensiue sorrow pind and wore away,<br>
Ne euer laught, ne once shew'd countenance glad;<br>
But alwaies wept and wailed night and day,<br>
As blasted bloosme through heat doth languish &amp; decay;<p>

Till on a day, as in his wonted wise<br>
His doole he made, there chaunst a turtle Doue<br>
To come, where he his dolors did deuise,<br>
That likewise late had lost her dearest loue;<br>
Which losse her made like passion also proue.<br>
Who seeing his sad plight, her tender heart<br>
With deare compassion deeply did emmoue,<br>
That she gan mone his vndeserued smart,<br>
And with her dolefull accent beare with him apart.<p>

Shee sitting by him as on ground he lay,<br>
Her mournefull notes full piteously did frame,<br>
And thereof made a lamentable lay,<br>
So sensibly compyld, that in the same<br>
Him seemed oft he heard his owne right name.<br>
With that he forth would poure so plenteous teares,<br>
And beat his breast vnworthy of such blame,<br>
And knocke his head, and rend his rugged heares,<br>
That could haue perst the hearts of Tigres &amp; of Beares.<p>

Thus long this gentle bird to him did vse,<br>
Withouten dread of perill to repaire<br>
Vnto his wonne, and with her mournefull muse<br>
Him to recomfort in his greatest care,<br>
That much did ease his mourning and misfare:<br>
And euery day for guerdon of her song,<br>
He part of his small feast to her would share;<br>
That at the last of all his woe and wrong<br>
Companion she became, and so continued long.<p>

Vpon a day as she him sate beside,<br>
By chance he certaine miniments forth drew,<br>
Which yet with him as relickes did abide<br>
Of all the bounty, which <i>Belphebe</i> threw<br>
On him, whilst goodly grace she did him shew:<br>
Amongst the rest a iewell rich he found,<br>
That was a Ruby of right perfect hew,<br>
Shap'd like a heart, yet bleeding of the wound,<br>
And with a litle golden chaine about it bound.<p>

The same he tooke, and with a riband new,<br>
In which his Ladies colours were, did bind<br>
About the turtles necke, that with the vew<br>
Did greatly solace his engrieued mind.<br>
All vnawares the bird, when she did find<br>
Her selfe so deckt, her nimble wings displaid,<br>
And flew away, as lightly as the wind:<br>
Which sodaine accident him much dismaid,<br>
And looking after long, did marke which way she straid.<p>

But when as long he looked had in vaine,<br>
Yet saw her forward still to make her flight,<br>
His weary eie returnd to him againe,<br>
Full of discomfort and disquiet plight,<br>
That both his iuell he had lost so light,<br>
And eke his deare companion of his care.<br>
But that sweet bird departing, flew forth right<br>
Through the wide region of the wastfull aire,<br>
Vntill she came where wonned his <i>Belphebe</i> faire.<p>

There found she her (as then it did betide)<br>
Sitting in couert shade of arbors sweet,<br>
After late weary toile, which she had tride<br>
In saluage chase, to rest as seem'd her meet.<br>
There she alighting, fell before her feet,<br>
And gan to her her mournfull plaint to make,<br>
As was her wont, thinking to let her weet<br>
The great tormenting griefe, that for her sake<br>
Her gentle Squire through her displeasure did pertake.<p>

She her beholding with attentiue eye,<br>
At length did marke about her purple brest<br>
That precious iuell, which she formerly<br>
Had knowne right well with colourd ribbands drest:<br>
Therewith she rose in hast, and her addrest<br>
With ready hand it to haue reft away.<br>
But the swift bird obayd not her behest,<br>
But swaru'd aside, and there againe did stay;<br>
She follow'd her, and thought againe it to assay.<p>

And euer when she nigh approcht, the Doue<br>
Would flit a litle forward, and then stay,<br>
Till she drew neare, and then againe remoue;<br>
So tempting her still to pursue the pray,<br>
And still from her escaping soft away:<br>
Till that at length into that forrest wide,<br>
She drew her far, and led with slow delay.<br>
In th'end she her vnto that place did guide,<br>
Whereas that wofull man in languor did abide.<p>

Eftsoones she flew vnto his fearelesse hand,<br>
And there a piteous ditty new deuiz'd,<br>
As if she would haue made him vnderstand,<br>
His sorrowes cause to be of her despis'd.<br>
Whom when she saw in wretched weedes disguiz'd,<br>
With heary glib deform'd, and meiger face,<br>
Like ghost late risen from his graue agryz'd,<br>
She knew him not, but pittied much his case,<br>
And wisht it were in her to doe him any grace.<p>

He her beholding, at her feet downe fell,<br>
And kist the ground on which her sole did tread,<br>
And washt the same with water, which did well<br>
From his moist eies, and like two streames procead;<br>
Yet spake no word, whereby she might aread<br>
What mister wight he was, or what he ment:<br>
But as one daunted with her presence dread,<br>
Onely few ruefull lookes vnto her sent,<br>
As messengers of his true meaning and intent.<p>

Yet nathemore his meaning she ared,<br>
But wondred much at his so selcouth case,<br>
And by his persons secret seemlyhed<br>
Well weend, that he had beene some man of place,<br>
Before misfortune did his hew deface:<br>
That being mou'd with ruth she thus bespake.<br>
Ah wofull man, what heauens hard disgrace,<br>
Or wrath of cruell wight on thee ywrake?<br>
Or selfe disliked life doth thee thus wretched make?<p>

If heauen, then none may it redresse or blame,<br>
Sith to his powre we all are subiect borne:<br>
If wrathfull wight, then fowle rebuke and shame<br>
Be theirs, that haue so cruell thee forlorne;<br>
But if through inward griefe or wilfull scorne<br>
Of life it be, then better doe aduise.<br>
For he whose daies in wilfull woe are worne,<br>
The grace of his Creator doth despise,<br>
That will not vse his gifts for thanklesse nigardise.<p>

When so he heard her say, eftsoones he brake<br>
His sodaine silence, which he long had pent,<br>
And sighing inly deepe, her thus bespake;<br>
Then haue they all themselues against me bent:<br>
For heauen, first author of my languishment,<br>
Enuying my too great felicity,<br>
Did closely with a cruell one consent,<br>
To cloud my daies in dolefull misery,<br>
And make me loath this life, still longing for to die.<p>

Ne any but your selfe, O dearest dred,<br>
Hath done this wrong, to wreake on worthlesse wight<br>
Your high displesure, through misdeeming bred:<br>
That when your pleasure is to deeme aright,<br>
Ye may redresse, and me restore to light.<br>
Which sory words her mightie hart did mate<br>
With mild regard, to see his ruefull plight,<br>
That her inburning wrath she gan abate,<br>
And him receiu'd againe to former fauours state.<p>

In which he long time afterwards did lead<br>
An happie life with grace and good accord,<br>
Fearlesse of fortunes chaunge or enuies dread,<br>
And eke all mindlesse of his owne deare Lord<br>
The noble Prince, who neuer heard one word<br>
Of tydings, what did vnto him betide,<br>
Or what good fortune did to him afford,<br>
But through the endlesse world did wander wide,<br>
Him seeking euermore, yet no where him descride.<p>

Till on a day as through that wood he rode,<br>
He chaunst to come where those two Ladies late,<br>
<i>AEmylia</i> and <i>Amoret</i> abode,<br>
Both in full sad and sorrowfull estate;<br>
The one right feeble through the euill rate<br>
Of food, which in her duresse she had found:<br>
The other almost dead and desperate<br>
Through her late hurts, and through that haplesse wound,<br>
With which the Squire in her defence her sore astound.<p>

Whom when the Prince beheld, he gan to rew<br>
The euill case in which those Ladies lay;<br>
But most was moued at the piteous vew<br>
Of <i>Amoret</i>, so neare vnto decay,<br>
That her great daunger did him much dismay.<br>
Eftsoones that pretious liquour forth he drew,<br>
Which he in store about him kept alway,<br>
And with few drops thereof did softly dew<br>
Her wounds, that vnto strength restor'd her soone anew.<p>

Tho when they both recouered were right well,<br>
He gan of them inquire, what euill guide<br>
Them thether brought, and how their harmes befell.<br>
To whom they told all, that did them betide,<br>
And how from thraldome vile they were vntide<br>
Of that same wicked Carle, by Virgins hond;<br>
Whose bloudie corse they shew'd him there beside,<br>
And eke his caue, in which they both were bond:<br>
At which he wondred much, when all those signes he fond.<p>

And euermore he greatly did desire<br>
To know, what Virgin did them thence vnbind;<br>
And oft of them did earnestly inquire,<br>
Where was her won, and how he mote her find.<br>
But when as nought according to his mind<br>
He could outlearne, he them from ground did reare:<br>
No seruice lothsome to a gentle kind;<br>
And on his warlike beast them both did beare,<br>
Himselfe by them on foot, to succour them from feare.<p>

So when that forrest they had passed well,<br>
A litle cotage farre away they spide,<br>
To which they drew, ere night vpon them fell;<br>
And entring in, found none therein abide,<br>
But one old woman sitting there beside,<br>
Vpon the ground in ragged rude attyre,<br>
With filthy lockes about her scattered wide,<br>
Gnawing her nayles for felnesse and for yre,<br>
And there out sucking venime to her parts entyre.<p>

A foule and loathly creature sure in sight,<br>
And in conditions to be loath'd no lesse:<br>
For she was stuft with rancour and despight<br>
Vp to the throat, that oft with bitternesse<br>
It forth would breake, and gush in great excesse,<br>
Pouring out streames of poyson and of gall<br>
Gainst all, that truth or vertue doe professe,<br>
Whom she with leasings lewdly did miscall,<br>
And wickedly backbite: Her name men <i>Sclaunder</i> call.<p>

Her nature is all goodnesse to abuse,<br>
And causelesse crimes continually to frame,<br>
With which she guiltlesse persons may accuse,<br>
And steale away the crowne of their good name;<br>
Ne euer Knight so bold, ne euer Dame<br>
So chast and loyall liu'd, but she would striue<br>
With forged cause them falsely to defame;<br>
Ne euer thing so well was doen aliue,<br>
But she with blame would blot, &amp; of due praise depriue.<p>

Her words were not, as common words are ment,<br>
T'expresse the meaning of the inward mind,<br>
But noysome breath, and poysnous spirit sent<br>
From inward parts, with cancred malice lind,<br>
And breathed forth with blast of bitter wind;<br>
Which passing through the eares, would pierce the hart,<br>
And wound the soule it selfe with griefe vnkind:<br>
For like the stings of Aspes, that kill with smart,<br>
Her spightfull words did pricke, &amp; wound the inner part.<p>

Such was that Hag, vnmeet to host such guests,<br>
Whom greatest Princes court would welcome fayne;<br>
But neede, that answers not to all requests,<br>
Bad them not looke for better entertayne;<br>
And eke that age despysed nicenesse vaine,<br>
Enur'd to hardnesse and to homely fare,<br>
Which them to warlike discipline did trayne,<br>
And manly limbs endur'd with little care<br>
Against all hard mishaps and fortunelesse misfare.<p>

Then all that euening welcommed with cold,<br>
And chearelesse hunger, they together spent;<br>
Yet found no fault, but that the Hag did scold<br>
And rayle at them with grudgefull discontent,<br>
For lodging there without her owne consent:<br>
Yet they endured all with patience milde,<br>
And vnto rest themselues all onely lent,<br>
Regardlesse of that queane so base and vilde,<br>
To be vniustly blamd, and bitterly reuilde.<p>

Here well I weene, when as these rimes be red<br>
With misregard, that some rash witted wight,<br>
Whose looser thought will lightly be misled,<br>
These gentle Ladies will misdeeme too light,<br>
For thus conuersing with this noble Knight;<br>
Sith now of dayes such temperance is rare<br>
And hard to finde, that heat of youthfull spright<br>
For ought will from his greedie pleasure spare:<br>
More hard for hungry steed t'abstaine from pleasant lare.<p>

But antique age yet in the infancie<br>
Of time, did liue then like an innocent,<br>
In simple truth and blamelesse chastitie,<br>
Ne then of guile had made experiment,<br>
But voide of vile and treacherous intent,<br>
Held vertue for it selfe in soueraine awe:<br>
Then loyall loue had royall regiment,<br>
And each vnto his lust did make a lawe,<br>
From all forbidden things his liking to withdraw.<p>

The Lyon there did with the Lambe consort,<br>
And eke the Doue sate by the Faulcons side,<br>
Ne each of other feared fraud or tort,<br>
But did in safe securitie abide,<br>
Withouten perill of the stronger pride:<br>
But when the world woxe old, it woxe warre old<br>
(Whereof it hight) and hauing shortly tride<br>
The traines of wit, in wickednesse woxe bold,<br>
And dared of all sinnes the secrets to vnfold.<p>

Then beautie, which was made to represent<br>
The great Creatours owne resemblance bright,<br>
Vnto abuse of lawlesse lust was lent,<br>
And made the baite of bestiall delight:<br>
Then faire grew foule, and foule grew faire in sight,<br>
And that which wont to vanquish God and man,<br>
Was made the vassall of the victors might;<br>
Then did her glorious flowre wex dead and wan,<br>
Despisd and troden downe of all that ouerran.<p>

And now it is so vtterly decayd,<br>
That any bud thereof doth scarse remaine,<br>
But if few plants preseru'd through heauenly ayd,<br>
In Princes Court doe hap to sprout againe,<br>
Dew'd with her drops of bountie Soueraine,<br>
Which from that goodly glorious flowre proceed,<br>
Sprung of the auncient stocke of Princes straine,<br>
Now th'onely remnant of that royall breed,<br>
Whose noble kind at first was sure of heauenly seed.<p>

Tho soone as day discouered heauens face<br>
To sinfull men with darknes ouerdight,<br>
This gentle crew gan from their eye-lids chace<br>
The drowzie humour of the dampish night,<br>
And did themselues vnto their iourney dight.<br>
So forth they yode, and forward softly paced,<br>
That them to view had bene an vncouth sight;<br>
How all the way the Prince on footpace traced,<br>
The Ladies both on horse, together fast embraced.<p>

Soone as they thence departed were afore,<br>
That shamefull Hag, the slaunder of her sexe,<br>
Them follow'd fast, and them reuiled sore,<br>
Him calling theefe, them whores; that much did vexe<br>
His noble hart; thereto she did annexe<br>
False crimes and facts, such as they neuer ment,<br>
That those two Ladies much asham'd did wexe:<br>
The more did she pursue her lewd intent,<br>
And rayl'd and rag'd, till she had all her poyson spent.<p>

At last when they were passed out of sight,<br>
Yet she did not her spightfull speach forbeare,<br>
But after them did barke, and still backbite,<br>
Though there were none her hatefull words to heare:<br>
Like as a curre doth felly bite and teare<br>
The stone, which passed straunger at him threw;<br>
So she them seeing past the reach of eare,<br>
Against the stones and trees did rayle anew,<br>
Till she had duld the sting, which in her tongs end grew.<p>

They passing forth kept on their readie way,<br>
With easie steps so soft as foot could stryde.<br>
Both for great feeblesse, which did oft assay<br>
Faire <i>Amoret</i>, that scarcely she could ryde;<br>
And eke through heauie armes, which sore annoyd<br>
The Prince on foot, not wonted so to fare;<br>
Whose steadie hand was faine his steede to guyde,<br>
And all the way from trotting hard to spare,<br>
So was his toyle the more, the more that was his care.<p>

At length they spide, where towards them with speed<br>
A Squire came gallopping, as he would flie;<br>
Bearing a litle Dwarfe before his steed,<br>
That all the way full loud for aide did crie,<br>
That seem'd his shrikes would rend the brasen skie:<br>
Whom after did a mightie man pursew,<br>
Ryding vpon a Dromedare on hie,<br>
Of stature huge, and horrible of hew,<br>
That would haue maz'd a man his dreadfull face to vew.<p>

For from his fearefull eyes two fierie beames,<br>
More sharpe then points of needles did proceede,<br>
Shooting forth farre away two flaming streames,<br>
Full of sad powre, that poysonous bale did breede<br>
To all, that on him lookt without good heed,<br>
And secretly his enemies did slay:<br>
Like as the Basiliske of serpents seede,<br>
From powrefull eyes close venim doth conuay<br>
Into the lookers hart, and killeth farre away.<p>

He all the way did rage at that same Squire,<br>
And after him full many threatnings threw,<br>
With curses vaine in his auengefull ire:<br>
But none of them (so fast away he flew)<br>
Him ouertooke, before he came in vew.<br>
Where when he saw the Prince in armour bright,<br>
He cald to him aloud, his case to rew,<br>
And rescue him through succour of his might,<br>
From that his cruell foe, that him pursewd in sight.<p>

Eftsoones the Prince tooke downe those Ladies twaine<br>
From loftie steede, and mounting in their stead<br>
Came to that Squire, yet trembling euery vaine:<br>
Of whom he gan enquire his cause of dread;<br>
Who as he gan the same to him aread,<br>
Loe hard behind his backe his foe was prest,<br>
With dreadfull weapon aymed at his head;<br>
That vnto death had doen him vnredrest,<br>
Had not the noble Prince his readie stroke represt.<p>

Who thrusting boldly twixt him and the blow,<br>
The burden of the deadly brunt did beare<br>
Vpon his shield, which lightly he did throw<br>
Ouer his head, before the harme came neare.<br>
Nathlesse it fell with so despiteous dreare<br>
And heauie sway, that hard vnto his crowne<br>
The shield it droue, and did the couering reare:<br>
Therewith both Squire and dwarfe did tomble downe<br>
Vnto the earth, and lay long while in senselesse swowne.<p>

Whereat the Prince full wrath, his strong right hand<br>
In full auengement heaued vp on hie,<br>
And stroke the Pagan with his steely brand<br>
So sore, that to his saddle bow thereby<br>
He bowed low, and so a while did lie:<br>
And sure had not his massie yron mace<br>
Betwixt him and his hurt bene happily,<br>
It would haue cleft him to the girding place,<br>
Yet as it was, it did astonish him long space.<p>

But when he to himselfe returnd againe,<br>
All full of rage he gan to curse and sweare,<br>
And vow by <i>Mahoune</i> that he should be slaine.<br>
With that his murdrous mace he vp did reare,<br>
That seemed nought the souse thereof could beare,<br>
And therewith smote at him with all his might.<br>
But ere that it to him approched neare,<br>
The royall child with readie quicke foresight,<br>
Did shun the proofe thereof and it auoyded light.<p>

But ere his hand he could recure againe,<br>
To ward his bodie from the balefull stound,<br>
He smote at him with all his might and maine,<br>
So furiously, that ere he wist, he found<br>
His head before him tombling on the ground.<br>
The whiles his babling tongue did yet blaspheme<br>
And curse his God, that did him so confound;<br>
The whiles his life ran foorth in bloudie streame,<br>
His soule descended downe into the Stygian reame.<p>

Which when that Squire beheld, he woxe full glad<br>
To see his foe breath out his spright in vaine:<br>
But that same dwarfe right sorie seem'd and sad,<br>
And howld aloud to see his Lord there slaine,<br>
And rent his haire and scratcht his face for paine.<br>
Then gan the Prince at leasure to inquire<br>
Of all the accident, there hapned plaine,<br>
And what he was, whose eyes did flame with fire;<br>
All which was thus to him declared by that Squire.<p>

This mightie man (quoth he) whom you haue slaine,<br>
Of an huge Geauntesse whylome was bred;<br>
And by his strength rule to himselfe did gaine<br>
Of many Nations into thraldome led,<br>
And mightie kingdomes of his force adred;<br>
Whom yet he conquer'd not by bloudie fight,<br>
Ne hostes of men with banners brode dispred,<br>
But by the powre of his infectious sight,<br>
With which he killed all, that came within his might.<p>

Ne was he euer vanquished afore,<br>
But euer vanquisht all, with whom he fought;<br>
Ne was there man so strong, but he downe bore,<br>
Ne woman yet so faire, but he her brought<br>
Vnto his bay, and captiued her thought.<br>
For most of strength and beautie his desire<br>
Was spoyle to make, and wast them vnto nought,<br>
By casting secret flakes of lustfull fire<br>
From his false eyes, into their harts and parts entire.<p>

Therefore <i>Corflambo</i> was he cald aright,<br>
Though namelesse there his bodie now doth lie,<br>
Yet hath he left one daughter that is hight<br>
The faire <i>Poeana</i>; who seemes outwardly<br>
So faire, as euer yet saw liuing eie:<br>
And were her vertue like her beautie bright,<br>
She were as faire as any vnder skie.<br>
But ah she giuen is to vaine delight,<br>
And eke too loose of life, and eke of loue too light.<p>

So as it fell there was a gentle Squire,<br>
That lou'd a Ladie of high parentage;<br>
But for his meane degree might not aspire<br>
To match so high, her friends with counsell sage,<br>
Dissuaded her from such a disparage.<br>
But she, whose hart to loue was wholly lent,<br>
Out of his hands could not redeeme her gage,<br>
But firmely following her first intent,<br>
Resolu'd with him to wend, gainst all her friends consent.<p>

So twixt themselues they pointed time and place,<br>
To which when he according did repaire,<br>
An hard mishap and disauentrous case<br>
Him chaunst; in stead of his <i>&AElig;mylia</i> faire<br>
This Gyants sonne, that lies there on the laire<br>
An headlesse heape, him vnawares there caught,<br>
And all dismayd through mercilesse despaire,<br>
Him wretched thrall vnto his dongeon brought,<br>
Where he remaines, of all vnsuccour'd and vnsought.<p>

This Gyants daughter came vpon a day<br>
Vnto the prison in her ioyous glee,<br>
To view the thrals, which there in bondage lay:<br>
Amongst the rest she chaunced there to see<br>
This louely swaine the Squire of low degree;<br>
To whom she did her liking lightly cast,<br>
And wooed him her paramour to bee:<br>
From day to day she woo'd and prayd him fast,<br>
And for his loue him promist libertie at last.<p>

He though affide vnto a former loue,<br>
To whom his faith he firmely ment to hold,<br>
Yet seeing not how thence he mote remoue,<br>
But by that meanes, which fortune did vnfold,<br>
Her graunted loue, but with affection cold<br>
To win her grace his libertie to get.<br>
Yet she him still detaines in captiue hold<br>
Fearing least if she should him freely set,<br>
He would her shortly leaue, and former loue forget.<p>

Yet so much fauour she to him hath hight,<br>
Aboue the rest, that he sometimes may space<br>
And walke about her gardens of delight,<br>
Hauing a keeper still with him in place;<br>
Which keeper is this Dwarfe, her dearling base,<br>
To whom the keyes of euery prison dore<br>
By her committed be, of speciall grace,<br>
And at his will may whom he list restore,<br>
And whom he list reserue, to be afflicted more.<p>

Whereof when tydings came vnto mine eare,<br>
Full inly sorie for the feruent zeale,<br>
Which I to him as to my soule did beare;<br>
I thether went where I did long conceale<br>
My selfe, till that the Dwarfe did me reueale,<br>
And told his Dame, her Squire of low degree<br>
Did secretly out of her prison steale;<br>
For me he did mistake that Squire to be;<br>
For neuer two so like did liuing creature see.<p>

Then was I taken and before her brought:<br>
Who through the likenesse of my outward hew,<br>
Being likewise beguiled in her thought,<br>
Gan blame me much for being so vntrew,<br>
To seeke by flight her fellowship t'eschew,<br>
That lou'd me deare, as dearest thing aliue.<br>
Thence she commaunded me to prison new;<br>
Whereof I glad did not gainesay nor striue,<br>
But suffred that same Dwarfe me to her dongeon driue.<p>

There did I finde mine onely faithfull frend<br>
In heauy plight and sad perplexitie;<br>
Whereof I sorie, yet my selfe did bend,<br>
Him to recomfort with my companie.<br>
But him the more agreeu'd I found thereby:<br>
For all his ioy, he said, in that distresse<br>
Was mine and his <i>&AElig;mylias</i> libertie.<br>
<i>&AElig;mylia</i> well he lou'd, as I mote ghesse;<br>
Yet greater loue to me then her he did professe.<p>

But I with better reason him auiz'd,<br>
And shew'd him how through error and mis-thought<br>
Of our like persons eath to be disguiz'd,<br>
Or his exchange, or freedome might be wrought.<br>
Whereto full loth was he, ne would for ought<br>
Consent, that I who stood all fearelesse free,<br>
Should wilfully be into thraldome brought,<br>
Till fortune did perforce it so decree.<br>
Yet ouerrul'd at last, he did to me agree.<p>

The morrow next about the wonted howre,<br>
The Dwarfe cald at the doore of <i>Amyas</i>,<br>
To come forthwith vnto his Ladies bowre.<br>
In steed of whom forth came I <i>Placidas</i>,<br>
And vndiscerned, forth with him did pas.<br>
There with great ioyance and with gladsome glee,<br>
Of faire <i>Poeana</i> I receiued was,<br>
And oft imbrast, as if that I were hee,<br>
And with kind words accoyd, vowing great loue to mee.<p>

Which I, that was not bent to former loue,<br>
As was my friend, that had her long refusd,<br>
Did well accept, as well it did behoue,<br>
And to the present neede it wisely vsd.<br>
My former hardnesse first I faire excusd;<br>
And after promist large amends to make.<br>
With such smooth termes her error I abusd,<br>
To my friends good, more then for mine owne sake,<br>
For whose sole libertie I loue and life did stake.<p>

Thenceforth I found more fauour at her hand,<br>
That to her Dwarfe, which had me in his charge,<br>
She bad to lighten my too heauie band,<br>
And graunt more scope to me to walke at large.<br>
So on a day as by the flowrie marge<br>
Of a fresh streame I with that Elfe did play,<br>
Finding no meanes how I might vs enlarge,<br>
But if that Dwarfe I could with me conuay,<br>
I lightly snatcht him vp, and with me bore away.<p>

Thereat he shriekt aloud, that with his cry<br>
The Tyrant selfe came forth with yelling bray,<br>
And me pursew'd; but nathemore would I<br>
Forgoe the purchase of my gotten pray,<br>
But haue perforce him hether brought away.<br>
Thus as they talked, loe where nigh at hand<br>
Those Ladies two yet doubtfull through dismay<br>
In presence came, desirous t'vnderstand<br>
Tydings of all, which there had hapned on the land.<p>

Where soone as sad <i>&AElig;mylia</i> did espie<br>
Her captiue louers friend, young <i>Placidas</i>:<br>
All mindlesse of her wonted modestie,<br>
She to him ran, and him with streight embras<br>
Enfolding said, And liues yet <i>Amyas</i>?<br>
He liues (quoth he) and his <i>&AElig;mylia</i> loues.<br>
Then lesse (said she) by all the woe I pas,<br>
With which my weaker patience fortune proues.<br>
But what mishap thus long him fro my selfe remoues?<p>

Then gan he all this storie to renew,<br>
And tell the course of his captiuitie;<br>
That her deare hart full deepely made to rew,<br>
And sigh full sore, to heare the miserie,<br>
In which so long he mercilesse did lie.<br>
Then after many teares and sorrowes spent,<br>
She deare besought the Prince of remedie:<br>
Who thereto did with readie will consent,<br>
And well perform'd, as shall appeare by his euent.<p>
