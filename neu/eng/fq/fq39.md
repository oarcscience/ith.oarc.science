THE FOVRTH  
BOOKE OF THE

FAERIE QVEENE.

*Containing*  
The Legend of Cambel and Telamond,

*OR*  
OF FRIENDSHIP.

> T He rugged forhead that with graue foresight  
> Welds kingdomes causes, & affaires of state,  
> My looser rimes (I wote) doth sharply wite,  
> For praising loue, as I haue done of late,  
> And magnifying louers deare debate;  
> By which fraile youth is oft to follie led,  
> Through false allurement of that pleasing baite,  
> That better were in vertues discipled,  
> Then with vaine poemes weeds to haue their fancies fed.
>
> Such ones ill iudge of loue, that cannot loue,  
> Ne in their frosen hearts feele kindly flame:  
> For thy, they ought not thing vnknowne reproue,  
> Ne naturall affection faultlesse blame,  
> For fault of few that haue abusd the same.  
> For it of honor and all vertue is  
> The roote, and brings forth glorious flowres of fame,  
> That crowne true louers with immortall blis,  
> The meed of them that loue, and do not liue amisse.
>
> Which who so list looke backe to former ages,  
> And call to count the things that then were donne,  
> Shall find, that all the workes of those wise sages,  
> And braue exploits which great Heroes wonne,  
> In loue were either ended or begunne:  
> Witnesse the father of Philosophie,  
> Which to his *Critias*, shaded oft from sunne,  
> Of loue full manie lessons did apply,  
> The which these Stoicke censours cannot well deny.
>
> To such therefore I do not sing at all,  
> But to that sacred Saint my soueraigne Queene,  
> In whose chast breast all bountie naturall,  
> And treasures of true loue enlocked beene,  
> Boue all her sexe that euer yet was seene;  
> To her I sing of loue, that loueth best,  
> And best is lou'd of all aliue I weene:  
> To her this song most fitly is addrest,  
> The Queene of loue, & Prince of peace frõ heauen blest.
>
> Which that she may the better deigne to heare,  
> Do thou dred infant, *Venus* dearling doue,  
> From her high spirit chase imperious feare,  
> And vse of awfull Maiestie remoue:  
> In sted thereof with drops of melting loue,  
> Deawd with ambrosiall kisses, by thee gotten  
> From thy sweete smyling mother from aboue,  
> Sprinckle her heart, and haughtie courage soften,  
> That she may hearke to loue, and reade this lesson often.
