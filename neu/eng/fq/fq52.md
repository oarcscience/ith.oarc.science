THE FIFTH  
BOOKE OF THE

FAERIE QVEENE.

*Contayning*

THE LEGEND OF ARTEGALL

*OR*  
OF IVSTICE.

> SO oft as I with state of present time,  
> The image of the antique world compare,  
> When as mans age was in his freshest prime,  
> And the first blossome of faire vertue bare,  
> Such oddes I finde twixt those, and these which are,  
> As that, through long continuance of his course,  
> Me seemes the world is runne quite out of square,  
> From the first point of his appointed sourse,  
> And being once amisse growes daily wourse and wourse.
>
> For from the golden age, that first was named,  
> It's now at earst become a stonie one;  
> And men themselues, the which at first were framed  
> Of earthly mould, and form'd of flesh and bone,  
> Are now transformed into hardest stone:  
> Such as behind their backs (so backward bred)  
> Were throwne by *Pyrrha* and *Deucalione*:  
> And if then those may any worse be red,  
> They into that ere long will be degendered.
>
> Let none then blame me, if in discipline  
> Of vertue and of ciuill vses lore,  
> I doe not forme them to the common line  
> Of present dayes, which are corrupted sore,  
> But to the antique vse, which was of yore,  
> When good was onely for it selfe desyred,  
> And all men sought their owne, and none no more;  
> When Iustice was not for most meed outhyred,  
> But simple Truth did rayne, and was of all admyred.
>
> For that which all men then did vertue call,  
> Is now cald vice; and that which vice was hight,  
> Is now hight vertue, and so vs'd of all:  
> Right now is wrong, and wrong that was is right,  
> As all things else in time are chaunged quight.  
> Ne wonder; for the heauens reuolution  
> Is wandred farre from where it first was pight,  
> And so doe make contrarie constitution  
> Of all this lower world, toward his dissolution.
>
> For who so list into the heauens looke,  
> And search the courses of the rowling spheares,  
> Shall find that from the point, where they first tooke  
> Their setting forth, in these few thousand yeares  
> They all are wandred much; that plaine appeares.  
> For that same golden fleecy Ram, which bore  
> *Phrixus* and *Helle* from their stepdames feares,  
> Hath now forgot, where he was plast of yore,  
> And shouldred hath the Bull, which fayre *Europa* bore.
>
> And eke the Bull hath with his bow-bent horne  
> So hardly butted those two twinnes of *Ioue*,  
> That they haue crusht the Crab, and quite him borne  
> Into the great *Nemoean* lions groue.  
> So now all range, and doe at randon roue  
> Out of their proper places farre away,  
> And all this world with them amisse doe moue,  
> And all his creatures from their course astray,  
> Till they arriue at their last ruinous decay.
>
> Ne is that same great glorious lampe of light,  
> That doth enlumine all these lesser fyres,  
> In better case, ne keepes his course more right,  
> But is miscaried with the other Spheres.  
> For since the terme of fourteene hundred fyeres,  
> That learned *Ptolomaee* his hight did take,  
> He is declyned from that marke of theirs,  
> Nigh thirtie minutes to the Southerne lake;  
> That makes me feare in time he will vs quite forsake.
>
> And if to those *Ægyptian* wisards old,  
> Which in Star-read were wont haue best insight,  
> Faith may be giuen, it is by them told,  
> That since the time they first tooke the Sunnes hight,  
> Foure times his place he shifted hath in sight,  
> And twice hath risen, where he now doth West,  
> And wested twice, where he ought rise aright.  
> But most is *Mars* amisse of all the rest,  
> And next to him old *Saturne*, that was wont be best.
>
> For during *Saturnes* ancient raigne it's sayd,  
> That all the world with goodnesse did abound:  
> All loued vertue, no man was affrayd  
> Of force, ne fraud in wight was to be found:  
> No warre was knowne, no dreadfull trompets sound,  
> Peace vniuersall rayn'd mongst men and beasts,  
> And all things freely grew out of the ground:  
> Iustice sate high ador'd with solemne feasts,  
> And to all people did diuide her dred beheasts.
>
> Most sacred vertue she of all the rest,  
> Resembling God in his imperiall might;  
> Whose soueraine powre is herein most exprest,  
> That both to good and bad he dealeth right,  
> And all his workes with Iustice hath bedight.  
> That powre he also doth to Princes lend,  
> And makes them like himselfe in glorious sight,  
> To sit in his owne seate, his cause to end,  
> And rule his people right, as he doth recommend.
>
> Dread Souerayne Goddesse, that doest highest sit  
> In seate of iudgement, in th'Almighties stead,  
> And with magnificke might and wondrous wit  
> Doest to thy people righteous doome aread,  
> That furthest Nations filles with awfull dread,  
> Pardon the boldnesse of thy basest thrall,  
> That dare discourse of so diuine a read,  
> As thy great iustice praysed ouer all:  
> The instrument whereof loe here thy *Artegall*.
