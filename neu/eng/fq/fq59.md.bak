*Cant. VII.*

> *Britomart comes to Isis Church,  
> Where shee strange visions sees:  
> She fights with Radigund, her slaies,  
> And Artegall thence frees.*

> N Ought is on earth more sacred or diuine,  
> That Gods and men doe equally adore,  
> Then this same vertue, that doth right define:  
> For th'heuens thẽselues, whence mortal men implore  
> Right in their wrongs, are rul'd by righteous lore  
> Of highest Ioue, who doth true iustice deale  
> To his inferiour Gods, and euermore  
> Therewith containes his heauenly Common-weale,  
> The skill whereof to Princes hearts he doth reueale.
>
> Well therefore did the antique world inuent,  
> That Iustice was a God of soueraine grace,  
> And altars vnto him, and temples lent,  
> And heauenly honours in the highest place;  
> Calling him great *Osyris*, of the race  
> Of th'old Ægyptian Kings, that whylome were;  
> With fayned colours shading a true case:  
> For that *Osyris*, whilest he liued here,  
> The iustest man aliue, and truest did appeare.
>
> His wife was *Isis*, whom they likewise made  
> A Goddesse of great powre and souerainty  
> And in her person cunningly did shade  
> That part of Iustice, which is Equity,  
> Whereof I haue to treat here presently.  
> Vnto whose temple when as *Britomart*  
> Arriued, shee with great humility  
> Did enter in, ne would that night depart;  
> But *Talus* mote not be admitted to her part.
>
> There she receiued was in goodly wize  
> Of many Priests, which duely did attend  
> Vppon the rites and daily sacrifize,  
> All clad in linnen robes with siluer hemd;  
> And on their heads with long locks comely kemd,  
> They wore rich Mitres shaped like the Moone,  
> To shew that *Isis* doth the Moone portend;  
> Like as *Osyris* signifies the Sunne.  
> For that they both like race in equall iustice runne.
>
> The Championesse them greeting, as she could,  
> Was thence by them into the Temple led;  
> Whose goodly building when she did behould,  
> Borne vppon stately pillours, all dispred  
> With shining gold, and arched ouer hed,  
> She wondred at the workemans passing skill,  
> Whose like before she neuer saw nor red;  
> And thereuppon long while stood gazing still,  
> But thought, that she thereon could neuer gaze her fill.
>
> Thence forth vnto the Idoll they her brought,  
> The which was framed all of siluer fine,  
> So well as could with cunning hand be wrought,  
> And clothed all in garments made of line,  
> Hemd all about with fringe of siluer twine.  
> Vppon her head she wore a Crowne of gold,  
> To shew that she had powre in things diuine;  
> And at her feete a Crocodile was rold,  
> That with her wreathed taile her middle did enfold.
>
> One foote was set vppon the Crocodile,  
> And on the ground the other fast did stand,  
> So meaning to suppresse both forged guile,  
> And open force: and in her other hand  
> She stretched forth a long white sclender wand.  
> Such was the Goddesse; whom when *Britomart*  
> Had long beheld, her selfe vppon the land  
> She did prostrate, and with right humble hart,  
> Vnto her selfe her silent prayers did impart.
>
> To which the Idoll as it were inclining,  
> Her wand did moue with amiable looke,  
> By outward shew her inward sence defining.  
> Who well perceiuing, how her wand she shooke,  
> It as a token of good fortune tooke.  
> By this the day with dampe was ouercast,  
> And ioyous light the house of *Ioue* forsooke:  
> Which when she saw, her helmet she vnlaste,  
> And by the altars side her selfe to slumber plaste.
>
> For other beds the Priests there vsed none,  
> But on their mother Earths deare lap did lie,  
> And bake their sides vppon the cold hard stone,  
> T'enure them selues to sufferaunce thereby  
> And proud rebellious flesh to mortify.  
> For by the vow of their religion  
> They tied were to stedfast chastity,  
> And continence of life, that all forgon,  
> They mote the better tend to their deuotion.
>
> Therefore they mote not taste of fleshly food,  
> Ne feed on ought, the which doth bloud containe,  
> Ne drinke of wine, for wine they say is blood,  
> Euen the bloud of Gyants, which were slaine,  
> By thundring Ioue in the Phlegrean plaine.  
> For which the earth (as they the story tell)  
> Wroth with the Gods, which to perpetuall paine  
> Had damn'd her sonnes, which gainst them did rebell,  
> With inward griefe and malice did against them swell.
>
> And of their vitall bloud, the which was shed  
> Into her pregnant bosome, forth she brought  
> The fruitfull vine, whose liquor blouddy red  
> Hauing the mindes of men with fury fraught,  
> Mote in them stirre vp old rebellious thought,  
> To make new warre against the Gods againe:  
> Such is the powre of that same fruit, that nought  
> The fell contagion may thereof restraine,  
> Ne within reasons rule, her madding mood containe.
>
> There did the warlike Maide her selfe repose,  
> Vnder the wings of *Isis* all that night,  
> And with sweete rest her heauy eyes did close,  
> After that long daies toile and weary plight.  
> Where whilest her earthly parts with soft delight  
> Of sencelesse sleepe did deeply drowned lie,  
> There did appeare vnto her heauenly spright  
> A wondrous vision, which did close implie  
> The course of all her fortune and posteritie.
>
> Her seem'd, as she was doing sacrifize  
> To *Isis*, deckt with Mitre on her hed,  
> And linnen stole after those Priestes guize,  
> All sodainely she saw transfigured  
> Her linnen stole to robe of scarlet red,  
> And Moone-like Mitre to a Crowne of gold,  
> That euen she her selfe much wondered  
> At such a chaunge, and ioyed to behold  
> Her selfe, adorn'd with gems and iewels manifold.
>
> And in the midst of her felicity,  
> An hideous tempest seemed from below,  
> To rise through all the Temple sodainely,  
> That from the Altar all about did blow  
> The holy fire, and all the embers strow  
> Vppon the ground, which kindled priuily,  
> Into outragious flames vnwares did grow,  
> That all the Temple put in ieopardy  
> Of flaming, and her selfe in great perplexity.
>
> With that the Crocodile, which sleeping lay  
> Vnder the Idols feete in fearelesse bowre,  
> Seem'd to awake in horrible dismay,  
> As being troubled with that stormy stowre;  
> And gaping greedy wide, did streight deuoure  
> Both flames and tempest: with which growen great,  
> And swolne with pride of his owne peerelesse powre,  
> He gan to threaten her likewise to eat;  
> But that the Goddesse with her rod him backe did beat.
>
> Tho turning all his pride to humblesse meeke,  
> Him selfe before her feete he lowly threw,  
> And gan for grace and loue of her to seeke:  
> Which she accepting, he so neare her drew,  
> That of his game she soone enwombed grew,  
> And forth did bring a Lion of great might;  
> That shortly did all other beasts subdew.  
> With that she waked, full of fearefull fright,  
> And doubtfully dismayd through that so vncouth sight.
>
> So thereuppon long while she musing lay,  
> With thousand thoughts feeding her fantasie,  
> Vntill she spide the lampe of lightsome day,  
> Vp-lifted in the porch of heauen hie.  
> Then vp she rose fraught with melancholy,  
> And forth into the lower parts did pas;  
> Whereas the Priestes she found full busily  
> About their holy things for morrow Mas:  
> Whom she saluting faire, faire resaluted was.
>
> But by the change of her vnchearefull looke,  
> They might perceiue, she was not well in plight;  
> Or that some pensiuenesse to heart she tooke.  
> Therefore thus one of them, who seem'd in sight  
> To be the greatest, and the grauest wight,  
> To her bespake; Sir Knight it seemes to me,  
> That thorough euill rest of this last night,  
> Or ill apayd, or much dismayd ye be,  
> That by your change of cheare is easie for to see.
>
> Certes (sayd she) sith ye so well haue spide  
> The troublous passion of my pensiue mind,  
> I will not seeke the same from you to hide,  
> But will my cares vnfolde, in hope to find  
> Your aide, to guide me out of errour blind.  
> Say on (quoth he) the secret of your hart:  
> For by the holy vow, which me doth bind,  
> I am adiur'd, best counsell to impart  
> To all, that shall require my comfort in their smart.
>
> Then gan she to declare the whole discourse  
> Of all that vision, which to her appeard,  
> As well as to her minde it had recourse.  
> All which when he vnto the end had heard,  
> Like to a weake faint-hearted man he fared,  
> Through great astonishment of that strange sight;  
> And with long locks vp-standing, stifly stared  
> Like one adawed with some dreadfull spright.  
> So fild with heauenly fury, thus he her behight.
>
> Magnificke Virgin, that in queint disguise  
> Of British armes doest maske thy royall blood,  
> So to pursue a perillous emprize,  
> How coul\[d\]st thou weene, through that disguized hood,  
> To hide thy state from being vnderstood?  
> Can from th'immortall Gods ought hidden bee?  
> They doe thy linage, and thy Lordly brood;  
> They doe thy sire, lamenting sore for thee;  
> They doe thy loue, forlorne in womens thraldome see.
>
> The end whereof, and all the long euent,  
> They doe to thee in this same dreame discouer.  
> For that same Crocodile doth represent  
> The righteous Knight, that is thy faithfull louer.  
> Like to *Osyris* in all iust endeuer.  
> For that same Crocodile *Osyris* is,  
> That vnder *Isis* feete doth sleepe for euer:  
> To shew that clemence oft in things amis,  
> Restraines those sterne behests, and cruell doomes of his.
>
> That Knight shall all the troublous stormes asswage,  
> And raging flames, that many foes shall reare,  
> To hinder thee from the iust heritage  
> Of thy sires Crowne, and from thy countrey deare.  
> Then shalt thou take him to thy loued fere,  
> And ioyne in equall portion of thy realme:  
> And afterwards a sonne to him shalt beare,  
> That Lion-like shall shew his powre extreame.  
> So blesse thee God, and giue thee ioyance of thy dreame
>
> All which when she vnto the end had heard,  
> She much was eased in her troublous thought,  
> And on those Priests bestowed rich reward:  
> And royall gifts of gold and siluer wrought,  
> She for a present to their Goddesse brought.  
> Then taking leaue of them, she forward went,  
> To seeke her loue, where he was to be sought;  
> Ne rested till she cam without relent  
> Vnto the land of Amazons, as she was bent.
>
> Whereof when newes to *Radigund* was brought,  
> Not with amaze, as women wonted bee,  
> She was confused in her troublous thought,  
> But fild with courage and with ioyous glee,  
> As glad to heare of armes, the which now she  
> Had long surceast, she bad to open bold,  
> That she the face of her new foe might see.  
> But when they of that yron man had told,  
> Which late her folke had slaine, she bad thẽ forth to hold.
>
> So there without the gate (as seemed best)  
> She caused her Pauilion be pight;  
> In which stout *Britomart* her selfe did rest,  
> Whiles *Talus* watched at the dore all night.  
> All night likewise, they of the towne in fright,  
> Vppon their wall good watch and ward did keepe.  
> The morrow next, so soone as dawning light  
> Bad doe away the dampe of drouzie sleepe,  
> The warlike Amazon out of her bowre did peepe.
>
> And caused streight a Trumpet loud to shrill,  
> To warne her foe to battell soone be prest:  
> Who long before awoke (for she ful ill  
> Could sleepe all night, that in vnquiet brest  
> Did closely harbour such a iealous guest)  
> Was to the battell whilome ready dight.  
> Eftsoones that warriouresse with haughty crest  
> Did forth issue, all ready for the fight:  
> On th'other side her foe appeared soone in sight.
>
> But ere they reared hand, the Amazone  
> Began the streight conditions to propound,  
> With which she vsed still to tye her fone;  
> To serue her so, as she the rest had bound.  
> Which when the other heard, she sternly frownd  
> For high disdaine of such indignity,  
> And would no lenger treat, but bad them sound.  
> For her no other termes should euer tie  
> Then what prescribed were by lawes of cheualrie.
>
> The Trumpets sound, and they together run  
> With greedy rage, and with their faulchins smot;  
> Ne either sought the others strokes to shun,  
> But through great fury both their skill forgot,  
> And practicke vse in armes: ne spared not  
> Their dainty parts, which nature had created  
> So faire and tender, without staine or spot,  
> For other vses, then they them translated;  
> Which they now hackt & hewd, as if such vse they hated,
>
> As when a Tygre and a Lionesse  
> Are met at spoyling of some hungry pray,  
> Both challenge it with equall greedinesse:  
> But first the Tygre clawes thereon did lay;  
> And therefore loth to loose her right away,  
> Doth in defence thereof full stoutly stond:  
> To which the Lion strongly doth gainesay,  
> That she to hunt the beast first tooke in hond;  
> And therefore ought it haue, where euer she it fond.
>
> Full fiercely layde the Amazon about,  
> And dealt her blowes vnmercifully sore:  
> Which *Britomart* withstood with courage stout,  
> And them repaide againe with double more.  
> So long they fought, that all the grassie flore  
> Was fild with bloud, which from their sides did flow,  
> And gushed through their armes, that all in gore  
> They trode, and on the ground their liues did strow,  
> Like fruitles seede, of which vntimely death should grow.
>
> At last proud *Radigund* with fell despight,  
> Hauing by chaunce espide aduantage neare,  
> Let driue at her with all her dreadfull might,  
> And thus vpbrayding sayd; This token beare  
> Vnto the man, whom thou doest loue so deare;  
> And tell him for his sake thy life thou gauest.  
> Which spitefull words she sore engrieu'd to heare,  
> Thus answer'd; Lewdly thou my loue deprauest,  
> Who shortly must repent that now so vainely brauest.
>
> Nath'lesse that stroke so cruell passage found,  
> That glauncing on her shoulder plate, it bit  
> Vnto the bone, and made a griesly wound,  
> That she her shield through raging smart of it  
> Could scarse vphold; yet soone she it requit.  
> For hauing force increast through furious paine,  
> She her so rudely on the helmet smit,  
> That it empierced to the very braine,  
> And her proud person low prostrated on the plaine.
>
> Where being layd, the wrothfull Britonesse  
> Stayd not, till she came to her selfe againe,  
> But in reuenge both of her loues distresse,  
> And her late vile reproch, though vaunted vaine,  
> And also of her wound, which sore did paine,  
> She with one stroke both head and helmet cleft.  
> Which dreadfull sight, when all her warlike traine  
> There present saw, each one of sence bereft,  
> Fled fast into the towne, and her sole victor left.
>
> But yet so fast they could not home retrate,  
> But that swift *Talus* did the formost win;  
> And pressing through the preace vnto the gate,  
> Pelmell with them attonce did enter in.  
> There then a piteous slaughter did begin:  
> For all that euer came within his reach,  
> He with his yron flale did thresh so thin,  
> That he no worke at all left for the leach:  
> Like to an hideous storme, which nothing may empeach.
>
> And now by this the noble Conqueresse  
> Her selfe came in, her glory to partake;  
> Where though reuengefull vow she did professe,  
> Yet when she saw the heapes, which he did make,  
> Of slaughtred carkasses, her heart did quake  
> For very ruth, which did it almost riue,  
> That she his fury willed him to slake:  
> For else he sure had left not one aliue,  
> But all in his reuenge of spirite would depriue.
>
> Tho when she had his execution stayd,  
> She for that yron prison did enquire,  
> In which her wretched loue was captiue layd:  
> Which breaking open with indignant ire,  
> She entred into all the partes entire.  
> Where when she saw that lothly vncouth sight,  
> Of men disguiz'd in womanishe attire,  
> Her heart gan grudge, for very deepe despight  
> Of so vnmanly maske, in misery misdight.
>
> At last when as to her owne Loue she came,  
> Whom like disguize no lesse deformed had,  
> At sight thereof abasht with secrete shame,  
> She turnd her head aside, as nothing glad,  
> To haue beheld a spectacle so bad:  
> And then too well beleeu'd, that which tofore  
> Iealous suspect as true vntruely drad,  
> Which vaine conceipt now nourishing no more,  
> She sought with ruth to salue his sad misfortunes sore.
>
> Not so great wonder and astonishment,  
> Did the most chast *Penelope* possesse,  
> To see her Lord, that was reported drent,  
> And dead long since in dolorous distresse,  
> Come home to her in piteous wretchednesse,  
> After long trauell of full twenty yeares,  
> That she knew not his fauours likelynesse,  
> For many scarres and many hoary heares,  
> But stood long staring on him, mongst vncertaine feares.
>
> Ah my deare Lord, what sight is this (quoth she)  
> What May-game hath misfortune made of you?  
> Where is that dreadfull manly looke? where be  
> Those mighty palmes, the which ye wont t'embrew  
> In bloud of Kings, and great hoastes to subdew?  
> Could ought on earth so wondrous change haue wrought,  
> As to haue robde you of that manly hew?  
> Could so great courage stouped haue to ought?  
> Then farewell fleshly force; I see thy pride is nought.
>
> Thenceforth she streight into a bowre him brought,  
> And causd him those vncomely weedes vndight;  
> And in their steede for other rayment sought,  
> Whereof there was great store, and armors bright,  
> Which had bene reft from many a noble Knight;  
> Whom that proud Amazon subdewed had,  
> Whilest Fortune fauourd her successe in fight,  
> In which when as she him anew had clad,  
> She was reuiu'd, and ioyd much in his semblance glad.
>
> So there a while they afterwards remained,  
> Him to refresh, and her late wounds to heale:  
> During which space she there as Princess rained,  
> And changing all that forme of common weale,  
> The liberty of women did repeale,  
> Which they had long vsurpt; and them restoring  
> To mens subiection, did true Iustice deale:  
> That all they as a Goddesse her adoring,  
> Her wisedome did admire, and hearkned to her loring.
>
> For all those Knights, which long in captiue shade  
> Had shrowded bene, she did from thraldome free;  
> And magistrates of all that city made,  
> And gaue to them great liuing and large fee:  
> And that they should for euer faithfull bee,  
> Made them sweare fealty to *Artegall*.  
> Who when him selfe now well recur'd did see,  
> He purposd to proceed, what so be fall,  
> Vppon his first aduenture, which him forth did call.
>
> Full sad and sorrowfull was *Britomart*  
> For his departure, her new cause of griefe;  
> Yet wisely moderated her owne smart,  
> Seeing his honor, which she tendred chiefe,  
> Consisted much in that aduentures priefe.  
> The care whereof, and hope of his successe  
> Gaue vnto her great comfort and reliefe,  
> That womanish complaints she did represse,  
> And tempred for the time her present heauinesse.
>
> There she continu'd for a certaine space,  
> Till through his want her woe did more increase:  
> Then hoping that the change of aire and place  
> Would change her paine, and sorrow somewhat ease,  
> She parted thence, her anguish to appease.  
> Meane while her noble Lord sir *Artegall*  
> Went on his way, ne euer howre did cease,  
> Till he redeemed had that Lady thrall:  
> That for another Canto will more fitly fall.
