*Cant. X.*

> *Scudamour doth his conquest tell,  
> Of vertuous Amoret:  
> Great Venus Temple is describ'd,  
> And louers life forth set.*

> T Rue he it said, what euer man it sayd,  
> That loue with gall and hony doth abound,  
> But if the one be with the other wayd,  
> For euery dram of hony therein found,  
> A pound of gall doth ouer it redound.  
> That I too true by triall haue approued:  
> For since the day that first with deadly wound  
> My heart was launcht, and learned to haue loued,  
> I neuer ioyed howre, but still with care was moued.
>
> And yet such grace is giuen them from aboue,  
> That all the cares and euill which they meet,  
> May nought at all their setled mindes remoue,  
> But seeme gainst common sence to them most sweet;  
> As bosting in their martyrdome vnmeet.  
> So all that euer yet I haue endured,  
> I count as naught, and tread downe vnder feet,  
> Since of my loue at length I rest assured,  
> That to disloyalty she will not be allured.
>
> Long were to tell the trauell and long toile,  
> Through which this shield of loue I late haue wonne,  
> And purchased this peerelesse beauties spoile,  
> That harder may be ended, then begonne.  
> But since ye so desire, your will be donne.  
> Then hearke ye gentle knights and Ladies free,  
> My hard mishaps, that ye may learne to shonne;  
> For though sweet loue to conquer glorious be,  
> Yet is the paine thereof much greater then the fee.
>
> What time the fame of this renowmed prise  
> Flew first abroad, and all mens eares possest,  
> I hauing armes then taken, gan auise  
> To winne me honour by some noble gest,  
> And purchase me some place amongst the best.  
> I boldly thought (so young mens thoughts are bold)  
> That this same braue emprize for me did rest,  
> And that both shield and she whom I behold,  
> Might be my lucky lot; sith all by lot we hold.
>
> So on that hard aduenture forth I went,  
> And to the place of perill shortly came.  
> That was a temple faire and auncient,  
> Which of great mother *Venus* bare the name,  
> And farre renowmed through exceeding fame;  
> Much more then that, which was in *Paphos* built,  
> Or that in *Cyprus*, both long since this same,  
> Though all the pillours of the one were guilt,  
> And all the others pauement were with yuory spilt.
>
> And it was seated in an Island strong,  
> Abounding all with delices most rare,  
> And wall'd by nature gainst inuaders wrong,  
> That none mote haue accesse, nor inward fare,  
> But by one way, that passage did prepare.  
> It was a bridge ybuilt in goodly wize,  
> With curious Corbes and pendants grauen faire,  
> And arched all with porches, did arize  
> On stately pillours, fram'd after the Doricke guize.
>
> And for defence thereof, on th'other end  
> There reared was a castle faire and strong,  
> That warded all which in or out did wend,  
> And flancked both the bridges sides along,  
> Gainst all that would it faine to force or wrong.  
> And therein wonned twenty valiant Knights;  
> All twenty tride in warres experience long;  
> Whose office was, against all manner wights  
> By all meanes to maintaine that castels ancient rights.
>
> Before that Castle was an open plaine,  
> And in the midst thereof a piller placed;  
> On which this shield, of many sought in vaine,  
> The shield of Loue, whose guerdon me hath graced,  
> Was hangd on high with golden ribbands laced;  
> And in the marble stone was written this,  
> With golden letters goodly well enchaced,  
> *Blessed the man that well can vse his blis:*  
> *VVhose euer be the shield, faire Amoret be his.*
>
> Which when I red, my heart did inly earne,  
> And pant with hope of that aduentures hap:  
> Ne stayed further newes thereof to learne,  
> But with my speare vpon the shield did rap,  
> That all the castle ringed with the clap.  
> Streight forth issewd a Knight all arm'd to proofe,  
> And brauely mounted to his most mishap:  
> Who staying nought to question from aloofe,  
> Ran fierce at me, that fire glaunst from his horses hoofe.
>
> Whom boldly I encountred (as I could)  
> And by good fortune shortly him vnseated.  
> Eftsoones out sprung two more of equall mould;  
> But I them both with equall hap defeated:  
> So all the twenty I likewise entreated,  
> And left them groning there vpon the plaine.  
> Then preacing to the pillour I repeated  
> The read thereof for guerdon of my paine,  
> And taking downe the shield, with me did it retaine.
>
> So forth without impediment I past,  
> Till to the Bridges vtter gate I came:  
> The which I found sure lockt and chained fast.  
> I knockt, but no man aunswred me by name;  
> I cald, but no man answerd to my clame.  
> Yet I perseuer'd still to knocke and call,  
> Till at the last I spide within the same,  
> Where one stood peeping through a creuis small,  
> To whom I cald aloud, halfe angry therewithall.
>
> That was to weet the Porter of the place,  
> Vnto whose trust the charge thereof was lent:  
> His name was *Doubt*, that had a double face,  
> Th'one forward looking, th'other backeward bent,  
> Therein resembling *Ianus* auncient,  
> Which hath in charge the ingate of the yeare:  
> And euermore his eyes about him went,  
> As if some proued perill he did feare,  
> Or did misdoubt some ill, whose cause did not appeare.
>
> On th'one side he, on th'other sate *Delay*,  
> Behinde the gate, that none her might espy;  
> Whose manner was all passengers to stay,  
> And entertaine with her occasions sly,  
> Through which some lost great hope vnheedily,  
> Which neuer they recouer might againe;  
> And others quite excluded forth, did ly  
> Long languishing there in vnpittied paine,  
> And seeking often entraunce, afterwards in vaine.
>
> Me when as he had priuily espide,  
> Bearing the shield which I had conquerd late,  
> He kend it streight, and to me opened wide.  
> So in I past, and streight he closd the gate.  
> But being in, *Delay* in close awaite  
> Caught hold on me, and thought my steps to stay,  
> Feigning full many a fond excuse to prate,  
> And time to steale, the threasure of mans day;  
> Whose smallest minute lost, no riches render may.
>
> But by no meanes my way I would forslow,  
> For ought that euer she could doe or say,  
> But from my lofty steede dismounting low,  
> Past forth on foote, beholding all the way  
> The goodly workes, and stones of rich assay,  
> Cast into sundry shapes by wondrous skill,  
> That like on earth no where I recken may:  
> And vnderneath, the riuer rolling still  
> With murmure soft, that seem'd to serue the workmans will.
>
> Thence forth I passed to the second gate,  
> The *Gate of good desert*, whose goodly pride  
> And costly frame, were long here to relate.  
> The same to all stoode alwaies open wide:  
> But in the Porch did euermore abide  
> An hideous Giant, dreadfull to behold,  
> That stopt the entraunce with his spacious stride,  
> And with the terrour of his countenance bold  
> Full many did affray, that else faine enter would.
>
> His name was *Daunger* dreaded ouer all,  
> Who day and night did watch and duely ward,  
> From fearefull cowards, entrance to forstall,  
> And faint-heart-fooles, whom shew of perill hard  
> Could terrifie from Fortunes faire adward:  
> For oftentimes faint hearts at first espiall  
> Of his grim face, were from approaching scard;  
> Vnworthy they of grace, whom one deniall  
> Excludes from fairest hope, withouten further triall.
>
> Yet many doughty warriours, often tride  
> In greater perils to be stout and bold,  
> Durst not the sternnesse of his looke abide,  
> But soone as they his countenance did behold,  
> Began to faint, and feele their corage cold.  
> Againe some other, that in hard assaies  
> Were cowards knowne, and litle count did hold,  
> Either through gifts, or guile, or such like waies,  
> Crept in by stouping low, or stealing of the kaies.
>
> But I though meanest man of many moe,  
> Yet much disdaining vnto him to lout,  
> Or creepe betweene his legs, so in to goe,  
> Resolu'd him to assault with manhood stout,  
> And either beat him in, or driue him out.  
> Eftsoones aduauncing that enchaunted shield,  
> With all my might I gan to lay about:  
> Which when he saw, the glaiue which he did wield  
> He gan forthwith t'auale, and way vnto me yield.
>
> So as I entred, I did backeward looke,  
> For feare of harme, that might lie hidden there;  
> And loe his hindparts, whereof heed I tooke,  
> Much more deformed fearefull vgly were,  
> Then all his former parts did earst appere.  
> For hatred, murther, treason, and despight,  
> With many moe lay in ambushment there,  
> Awayting to entrap the warelesse wight,  
> Which did not them preuent with vigilant foresight.
>
> Thus hauing past all perill, I was come  
> Within the compasse of that Islands space;  
> The which did seeme vnto my simple doome,  
> The onely pleasant and delightfull place,  
> That euer troden was of footings trace.  
> For all that nature by her mother wit  
> Could frame in earth, and forme of substance base,  
> Was there, and all that nature did omit,  
> Art playing second natures part, supplyed it.
>
> No tree, that is of count, in greenewood growes,  
> From lowest Iuniper to Ceder tall,  
> No flowre in field, that daintie odour throwes,  
> And deckes his branch with blossomes ouer all,  
> But there was planted, or grew naturall:  
> Nor sense of man so coy and curious nice,  
> But there mote find to please it selfe withall;  
> Nor hart could wish for any queint deuice,  
> But there it present was, and did fraile sense entice.
>
> In such luxurious plentie of all pleasure,  
> It seem'd a second paradise to ghesse,  
> So lauishly enricht with natures threasure,  
> That if the happie soules, which doe possesse  
> Th'Elysian fields, and liue in lasting blesse,  
> Should happen this with liuing eye to see,  
> They soone would loath their lesser happinesse,  
> And wish to life return'd againe to bee,  
> That in this ioyous place they mote haue ioyance free.
>
> Fresh shadowes, fit to shroud from sunny ray;  
> Faire lawnds, to take the sunne in season dew;  
> Sweet springs, in which a thousand Nymphs did play;  
> Soft rombling brookes, that gentle slomber drew;  
> High reared mounts, the lands about to vew;  
> Low looking dales, disloignd from common gaze;  
> Delightfull bowres, to solace louers trew;  
> False Labyrinthes, fond runners eyes to daze;  
> All which by nature made did nature selfe amaze.
>
> And all without were walkes and alleyes dight,  
> With diuers trees, enrang'd in euen rankes;  
> And here and there were pleasant arbors pight,  
> And shadie seates, and sundry flowring bankes,  
> To sit and rest the walkers wearie shankes,  
> And therein thousand payres of louers walkt,  
> Praysing their god, and yeelding him great thankes,  
> Ne euer ought but of their true loues talkt,  
> Ne euer for rebuke or blame of any balkt.
>
> All these together by themselves did sport  
> Their spotlesse pleasures, and sweet loues content.  
> But farre away from these, another sort  
> Of louers lincked in true harts consent;  
> Which loued not as these, for like intent,  
> But on chast vertue grounded their desire,  
> Farre from all fraud, or fayned blandishment;  
> Which in their spirits kindling zealous fire,  
> Braue thoughts and noble deedes did euermore aspire.
>
> Such were great *Hercules*, and *Hylas* deare;  
> Trew *Ionathan*, and *Dauid* trustie tryde;  
> Stout *Theseus*, and *Pirithous* his feare;  
> *Pylades* and *Orestes* by his syde;  
> Myld *Titus* and *Gesippus* without pryde;  
> *Damon* and *Pythias* whom death could not seuer;  
> All these and all that euer had bene tyde,  
> In bands of friendship, there did liue for euer,  
> Whose liues although decay'd, yet loues decayed neuer.
>
> Which when as I, that neuer tasted blis,  
> Nor happie howre, beheld with gazefull eye,  
> I thought there was none other heauen then this;  
> And gan their endlesse happinesse enuye,  
> That being free from feare and gealosye,  
> Might frankely there their loues desire possesse;  
> Whilest I through paines and perlous ieopardie,  
> Was forst to seeke my lifes deare patronesse:  
> Much dearer be the things, which come through hard distresse.
>
> Yet all those sights, and all that else I saw,  
> Might not my steps withhold, but that forthright  
> Vnto that purposd place I did me draw,  
> Where as my loue was lodged day and night:  
> The temple of great *Venus*, that is hight  
> The Queene of beautie, and of loue the mother,  
> There worshipped of euery liuing wight;  
> Whose goodly workmanship farre past all other  
> That euer were on earth, all were they set together.
>
> Not that same famous Temple of *Diane*,  
> Whose hight all *Ephesus* did ouersee,  
> And which all *Asia* sought with vowes prophane,  
> One of the worlds seuen wonders sayd to bee,  
> Might match with this by many a degree:  
> Nor that, which that wise King of *Iurie* framed,  
> With endlesse cost, to be th'Almighties see;  
> Nor all that else through all the world is named  
> To all the heathen Gods, might like to this be clamed.
>
> I much admyring that so goodly frame,  
> Vnto the porch approcht, which open stood;  
> But therein sate an amiable Dame,  
> That seem'd to be of very sober mood,  
> And in her semblant shewed great womanhood:  
> Strange was her tyre; for on her head a crowne  
> She wore much like vnto a Danisk hood  
> Poudred with pearle and stone, and all her gowne  
> Enwouen was with gold, that raught full low a downe.
>
> On either side of her, two young men stood,  
> Both strongly arm'd, as fearing one another;  
> Yet were they brethren both of halfe the blood,  
> Begotten by two fathers of one mother,  
> Though of contrarie natures each to other:  
> The one of them hight *Loue*, the other *Hate*,  
> *Hate* was the elder, *Loue* the younger brother;  
> Yet was the younger stronger in his state  
> Then th'elder, and him maystred still in all debate.
>
> Nathlesse that Dame so well them tempred both,  
> That she them forced hand to ioyne in hand,  
> Albe that *Hatred* was thereto full loth,  
> And turn'd his face away, as he did stand,  
> Vnwilling to behold that louely band.  
> Yet she was of such grace and vertuous might,  
> That her commaundment he could not withstand,  
> But bit his lip for felonous despight,  
> And gnasht his yron tuskes at that displeasing sight.
>
> *Concord* she cleeped was in common reed,  
> Mother of blessed *Peace*, and *Friendship* trew;  
> They both her twins, both borne of heauenly seed,  
> And she her selfe likewise diuinely grew;  
> The which right well her workes diuine did shew:  
> For strength, and wealth, and happinesse she lends,  
> And strife, and warre, and anger does subdew:  
> Of litle much, of foes she maketh frends,  
> And to afflicted minds sweet rest and quiet sends.
>
> By her the heauen is in his course contained,  
> And all the world in state vnmoued stands,  
> As their Almightie maker first ordained,  
> And bound them with inuiolable bands;  
> Else would the waters ouerflow the lands,  
> And fire deuoure the ayre, and hell them quight,  
> But that she holds them with her blessed hands.  
> She is the nourse of pleasure and delight,  
> And vnto *Venus* grace the gate doth open right.
>
> By her I entring halfe dismayed was,  
> But she in gentle wise me entertayned,  
> And twixt her selfe and *Loue* did let me pas;  
> But *Hatred* would my entrance haue restrayned,  
> And with his club me threatned to haue brayned,  
> Had not the Ladie with her powrefull speach  
> Him from his wicked will vneath refrayned;  
> And th'other eke his malice did empeach,  
> Till I was throughly past the perill of his reach.
>
> Into the inmost Temple thus I came,  
> Which fuming all with frankensence I found,  
> And odours rising from the altars flame.  
> Vpon an hundred marble pillors round  
> The roofe vp high was reared from the ground,  
> All deckt with crownes, & chaynes, and girlands gay,  
> And thousand pretious gifts worth many a pound,  
> The which sad louers for their vowes did pay;  
> And all the ground was strow'd with flowres, as fresh as May.
>
> An hundred Altars round about were set,  
> All flaming with their sacrifices fire,  
> That with the steme thereof the Temple swet,  
> Which rould in clouds to heauen did aspire,  
> And in them bore true louers vowes entire:  
> And eke an hundred brasen caudrons bright,  
> To bath in ioy and amorous desire,  
> Euery of which was to a damzell hight;  
> For all the Priests were damzels, in soft linnen dight.
>
> Right in the midst the Goddesse selfe did stand  
> Vpon an altar of some costly masse,  
> Whose substance was vneath to vnderstand:  
> For neither pretious stone, nor durefull brasse,  
> For shining gold, nor mouldring clay it was;  
> But much more rare and pretious to esteeme,  
> Pure in aspect, and like to christall glasse,  
> Yet glasse was not, if one did rightly deeme,  
> But being faire and brickle, likest glasse did seeme.
>
> But it in shape and beautie did excell  
> All other Idoles, which the heathen adore  
> Farre passing that, which by surpassing skill  
> *Phidias* did make in *Paphos* Isle of yore,  
> With which that wretched Greeke, that life forlore  
> Did fall in loue: yet this much fairer shined,  
> But couered with a slender veile afore;  
> And both her feete and legs together twyned  
> Were with a snake, whose head & tail were fast cõbyned.
>
> The cause why she was couered with a vele,  
> Was hard to know, for that her Priests the same  
> From peoples knowledge labour'd to concele.  
> But sooth it was not sure for womanish shame,  
> Nor any blemish, which the worke mote blame;  
> But for, they say, she hath both kinds in one,  
> Both male and female, both vnder one name:  
> She syre and mother is her selfe alone,  
> Begets and eke conceiues, ne needeth other none.
>
> And all about her necke and shoulders flew  
> A flocke of litle loues, and sports, and ioyes,  
> With nimble wings of gold and purple hew;  
> Whose shapes seem'd not like to terrestriall boyes,  
> But like to Angels playing heauenly toyes;  
> The whilest their eldest brother was away,  
> *Cupid* their eldest brother; he enioyes  
> The wide kingdome of loue with Lordly sway,  
> And to his law compels all creatures to obay.
>
> And all about her altar scattered lay  
> Great sorts of louers piteously complayning,  
> Some of their losse, some of their loues delay,  
> Some of their pride, some paragons disdayning,  
> Some fearing fraud, some fraudulently fayning,  
> As euery one had cause of good or ill.  
> Amongst the rest some one through loues constrayning,  
> Tormented sore, could not containe it still,  
> But thus brake forth, that all the temple it did fill.
>
> Great *Venus*, Queene of beautie and of grace,  
> The ioy of Gods and men, that vnder skie  
> Doest fayrest shine, and most adorne thy place,  
> That with thy smyling looke doest pacifie  
> The raging seas, and makst the stormes to flie;  
> Thee goddesse, thee the winds, the clouds doe feare,  
> And when thou spredst thy mantle forth on hie,  
> The waters play and pleasant lands appeare,  
> And heauens laugh, & all the world shews ioyous cheare.
>
> Then doth the dædale earth throw forth to thee  
> Out of her fruitfull lap aboundant flowres,  
> And then all liuing wights, soone as they see  
> The spring breake forth out of his lusty bowres,  
> They all doe learne to play the Paramours;  
> First doe the merry birds, thy prety pages  
> Priuily pricked with thy lustfull powres,  
> Chirpe loud to thee out of their leauy cages,  
> And thee their mother call to coole their kindly rages.
>
> Then doe the saluage beasts begin to play  
> Their pleasant friskes, and loath their wonted food;  
> The Lyons rore, the Tygres loudly bray,  
> The raging Buls rebellow through the wood,  
> And breaking forth, dare tempt the deepest flood,  
> To come where thou doest draw them with desire:  
> So all things else, that nourish vitall blood,  
> Soone as with fury thou doest them inspire,  
> In generation seeke to quench their inward fire.
>
> So all the world by thee at first was made,  
> And dayly yet thou doest the same repayre:  
> Ne ought on earth that merry is and glad,  
> Ne ought on earth that louely is and fayre,  
> But thou the same for pleasure didst prepayre.  
> Thou art the root of all that ioyous is,  
> Great God of men and women, queene of th'ayre,  
> Mother of laughter, and welspring of blisse,  
> O graunt that of my loue at last I may not misse.
>
> So did he say: but I with murmure soft,  
> That none might heare the sorrow of my hart,  
> Yet inly groning deepe and sighing oft,  
> Besought her to graunt ease vnto my smart,  
> And to my wound her gratious help impart.  
> Whilest thus I spake, behold with happy eye  
> I spyde, where at the Idoles feet apart  
> A beuie of fayre damzels close did lye,  
> Wayting when as the Antheme should be sung on hye.
>
> The first of them did seeme of ryper yeares,  
> And grauer countenance then all the rest;  
> Yet all the rest were eke her equall peares,  
> Yet vnto her obayed all the best.  
> Her name was *VVomanhood*, that she exprest  
> By her sad semblant and demeanure wyse:  
> For stedfast still her eyes did fixed rest,  
> Ne rov'd at randon after gazers guyse,  
> Whose luring baytes oftimes doe heedlesse harts entyse.
>
> And next to her sate goodly *Shamefastnesse*,  
> Ne euer durst her eyes from ground vpreare,  
> Ne euer once did looke vp from her desse,  
> As if some blame of euill she did feare,  
> That in her cheekes made roses oft appeare:  
> And her against sweet *Cherefulnesse* was placed,  
> Whose eyes like twinkling stars in euening cleare,  
> Were deckt with smyles, that all sad humors chaced,  
> And darted forth delights, the which her goodly graced.
>
> And next to her sate sober *Modestie*,  
> Holding her hand vpon her gentle hart;  
> And her against sate comely *Curtesie*,  
> That vnto euery person knew her part;  
> And her before was seated ouerthwart  
> Soft *Silence*, and submisse *Obedience*,  
> Both linckt together neuer to dispart,  
> Both gifts of God not gotten but from thence,  
> Both girlonds of his Saints against their foes offence.
>
> Thus sate they all a round in seemely rate:  
> And in the midst of them a goodly mayd,  
> Euen in the lap of *VVomanhood* there sate,  
> The which was all in lilly white arayd,  
> With siluer streames amongst the linnen stray'd;  
> Like to the Morne, when first her shyning face  
> Hath to the gloomy world it selfe bewray'd,  
> That same was fayrest *Amoret* in place,  
> Shyning with beauties light, and heauenly vertues grace.
>
> Whom soone as I beheld, my hart gan throb,  
> And wade in doubt, what best were to be donne:  
> For sacrilege me seem'd the Church to rob,  
> And folly seem'd to leaue the thing vndonne,  
> Which with so strong attempt I had begonne.  
> Tho shaking off all doubt and shamefast feare,  
> Which Ladies loue I heard had neuer wonne  
> Mongst men of worth, I to her stepped neare,  
> And by the lilly hand her labour'd vp to reare.
>
> Thereat that formost matrone me did blame,  
> And sharpe rebuke, for being ouer bold;  
> Saying it was to Knight vnseemely shame,  
> Vpon a recluse Virgin to lay hold,  
> That vnto *Venus* seruices was sold.  
> To whom I thus, Nay but it fitteth best,

> With that my shield I forth to her did show,  
> Which all that while I closely had conceld;  
> On which when *Cupid* with his killing bow  
> And cruell shafts emblazond she beheld,  
> At sight thereof she was with terror queld,  
> And said no more: but I which all that while  
> The pledge of faith, her hand engaged held,  
> Like warie Hynd within the weedie soyle,  
> For no intreatie would forgoe so glorious spoyle.
>
> And euermore vpon the Goddesse face  
> Mine eye was fixt, for feare of her offence:  
> Whom when I saw with amiable grace  
> To laugh at me, and fauour my pretence,  
> I was emboldned with more confidence;  
> And nought for nicenesse nor for enuy sparing,  
> In presence of them all forth led her thence:  
> All looking on, and like astonisht staring,  
> Yet to lay hand on her, not one of all them daring.
>
> She often prayd, and often me besought,  
> Sometime with tender teares to let her goe,  
> Sometime with witching smyles: but yet for nought,  
> That euer she to me could say or doe,  
> Could she her wished freedome fro me wooe;  
> But forth I led her through the Temple gate,  
> By which I hardly past with much adoe:  
> But that same Ladie which me friended late  
> In entrance, did me also friend in my retrate.
>
> No lesse did *Daunger* threaten me with dread,  
> When as he saw me, maugre all his powre,  
> That glorious spoyle of beautie with me lead,  
> Then *Cerberus*, when *Orpheus* did recoure  
> His Leman from the Stygian Princes boure.  
> But euermore my shield did me defend,  
> Against the storme of euery dreadfull stoure:  
> Thus safely with my loue I thence did wend.  
> So ended he his tale, where I this Canto end.
