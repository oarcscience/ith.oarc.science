<blockquote>
<i> The Patron of true Holinesse,<br> 
Foule Errour doth defeate:<br> 
Hypocrisie him to entrappe,<br>
Doth to his home entreate.</i>   <p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote> 
A Gentle Knight was pricking on 
the plaine,<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Y cladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet armes till that time did he neuer wield:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Full iolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,<br>
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.<p>
 
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And dead as liuing euer him ador'd:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vpon his shield the like was also scor'd,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For soueraine hope, which in his helpe he had:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;<br>
Yet nothing did he dread, but euer was ydrad.<p>
 
Vpon a great aduenture he was bond,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That greatest <i>Gloriana</i> to him gaue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That greatest Glorious Queene of <i>Faerie</i> lond,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To winne him worship, and her grace to haue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Which of all earthly things he most did craue;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And euer as he rode, his hart did earne<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To proue his puissance in battell braue<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vpon his foe, and his new force to learne;<br>
Vpon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.<p>
 
A louely Ladie rode him faire beside,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vpon a lowly Asse more white then snow,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vnder a vele, that wimpled was full low,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And ouer all a blacke stole she did throw,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And heauie sat vpon her palfrey slow:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,<br>
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.<p>
 
So pure and innocent, as that same lambe,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
She was in life and euery vertuous lore,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And by descent from Royall lynage came<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And all the world in their subiection held;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Till that infernall feend with foule vprore<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:<br>
Whom to auenge, she had this Knight from far c&otilde;peld.<p>
 
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That lasie seemd in being euer last,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Or wearied with bearing of her bag<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of needments at his backe.  Thus as they past,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And angry <i>Ioue</i> an hideous storme of raine<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That euery wight to shrowd it did constrain,<br>
And this faire couple eke to shroud th&#7869;selues were fain.<p>
 
Enforst to seeke some couert nigh at hand,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A shadie groue not far away they spide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Did spred so broad, that heauens light did hide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Not perceable with power of any starre:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And all within were pathes and alleies wide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With footing worne, and leading inward farre:<br>
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.<p>
 
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ioying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar neuer dry,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,<br>
The Aspine good for staues, the Cypresse funerall.<p>
 
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The fruitfull Oliue, and the Platane round,<br>
The caruer Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.<p>
 
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vntill the blustring storme is ouerblowne;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
When weening to returne, whence they did stray,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
They cannot finde that path, which first was showne,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
So many pathes, so many turnings seene,<br>
That which of them to take, in diuerse doubt they been.<p>
 
At last resoluing forward still to fare,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Till that some end they finde or in or out,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And like to lead the labyrinth about;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
At length it brought them to a hollow caue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Amid the thickest woods.  The Champion stout<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue,<br>
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gaue.<p>
 
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash prouoke:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The danger hid, the place vnknowne and wilde,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Breedes dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And perill without show: therefore your stroke<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to reuoke<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The forward footing for an hidden shade:<br>
Vertue giues her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.<p>
 
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
I better wot then you, though now too late<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
This is the wandring wood, this <i>Errours den</i>,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Therefore I read beware.  Fly fly (quoth then<br>
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for liuing men.<p>
 
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But forth vnto the darksome hole he went,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And looked in: his glistring armor made<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A litle glooming light, much like a shade,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
By which he saw the vgly monster plaine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,<br>
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.<p>
 
And as she lay vpon the durtie ground,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her huge long taile her den all ouerspred,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Pointed with mortall sting.  Of her there bred<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Sucking vpon her poisonous dugs, each one<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill fauored:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Soone as that vncouth light vpon them shone,<br>
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.<p>
 
Their dam vpstart, out of her den effraide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For light she hated as the deadly bale,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,<br>
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.<p>
 
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiu'd, he lept<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As Lyon fierce vpon the flying pray,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
From turning backe, and forced her to stay:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And turning fierce, her speckled taile aduaunst,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:<br>
The stroke down fr&otilde; her head vnto her shoulder glaunst.<p>
 
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And all attonce her beastly body raizd<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With doubled forces high aboue the ground:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Tho wrapping vp her wrethed sterne arownd,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Lept fierce vpon his shield, and her huge traine<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
All suddenly about his body wound,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That hand or foot to stirre he stroue in vaine:<br>
God helpe the man so wrapt in <i>Errours</i> endlesse traine.<p>
 
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Add faith vnto your force, and be not faint:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That when he heard, in great perplexitie,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And knitting all his force got one hand free,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,<br>
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.<p>
 
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:<br>
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.<p>
 
As when old father <i>Nilus</i> gins to swell<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With timely pride aboue the <i>Aegyptian</i> vale,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His fattie waues do fertile slime outwell,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But when his later spring gins to auale,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Huge heapes of mudd he leaues, wherein there breed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;<br>
Such vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed.<p>
 
The same so sore annoyed has the knight,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whose corage when the feend perceiu'd to shrinke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Which swarming all about his legs did crall,<br>
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.<p>
 
As gentle Shepheard in sweete euen-tide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
When ruddy <i>Phoebus</i> gins to welke in west,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
All striuing to infixe their feeble stings,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That from their noyance he no where can rest,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But with his clownish hands their tender wings<br>
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.<p>
 
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Then of the certaine perill he stood in,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Halfe furious vnto his foe he came,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And strooke at her with more then manly force,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That from her body full of filthie sin<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;<br>
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed fr&otilde; her corse.<p>
 
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
They saw so rudely falling to the ground,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Gathred themselues about her body round,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Weening their wonted entrance to haue found<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
They flocked all about her bleeding wound,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And sucked vp their dying mothers blood,<br>
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.<p>
 
That detestable sight him much amazde,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To see th'vnkindly Impes of heauen accurst,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Deuoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,<br>
His foes haue slaine themselues, with whom he should contend.<p>
 
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And said, Faire knight, borne vnder happy starre,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Well worthy be you of that Armorie,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Wherein ye haue great glory wonne this day,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And proou'd your strength on a strong enimie,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Your first aduenture: many such I pray,<br>
And henceforth euer wish, that like succeed it may.<p>
 
Then mounted he vpon his Steede againe,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That path he kept, which beaten was most plaine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ne euer would to any by-way bend,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But still did follow one vnto the end,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The which at last out of the wood them brought.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
So forward on his way (with God to frend)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He passed forth, and new aduenture sought;<br>
Long way he trauelled, before he heard of ought.<p>
 
At length they chaunst to meet vpon the way<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And all the way he prayed, as he went,<br>
And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.<p>
 
He faire the knight saluted, louting low,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And after asked him, if he did know<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of straunge aduentures, which abroad did pas.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Silly old man, that liues in hidden cell,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?<br>
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.<p>
 
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And homebred euill ye desire to heare,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And shall you well reward to shew the place,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,<br>
That such a cursed creature liues so long a space.<p>
 
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His dwelling is, by which no liuing wight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
May euer passe, but thorough great distresse.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And well I wote, that of your later fight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But wanting rest will also want of might?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The Sunne that measures heauen all day long,<br>
At night doth baite his steedes the <i>Ocean</i> waues emong.<p>
 
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And with new day new worke at once begin:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vntroubled night they say giues counsell best.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Right well Sir knight ye haue aduised bin,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Is wisely to aduise: now day is spent;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Therefore with me ye may take vp your In<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For this same night.  The knight was well content:<br>
So with that godly father to his home they went.<p>
 
A little lowly Hermitage it was,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Far from resort of people, that did pas<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In trauell to and froe: a little wyde<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
There was an holy Chappell edifyde,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His holy things each morne and euentyde:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,<br>
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.<p>
 
Arriued there, the little house they fill,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The noblest mind the best contentment has.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With faire discourse the euening so they pas:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He told of Saintes and Popes, and euermore<br>
He strowd an <i>Aue-Mary</i> after and before.<p>
 
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As messenger of <i>Morpheus</i> on them cast<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Sweet sl&otilde;bring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He to his study goes, and there amiddes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,<br>
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes<p>
 
Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With which and other spelles like terrible,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He bad awake blacke <i>Plutoes</i> griesly Dame,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And cursed heauen, and spake reprochfull shame<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Great <i>Gorgon</i>, Prince of darknesse and dead night,<br>
At which <i>Cocytus</i> quakes, and <i>Styx</i> is put to flight.<p>
 
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Fluttring about his euer damned hed,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A-waite whereto their seruice he applyes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The one of them he gaue a message too,<br>
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.<p>
 
He making speedy way through spersed ayre,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And through the world of waters wide and deepe,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To <i>Morpheus</i> house doth hastily repaire.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And low, where dawning day doth neuer peepe,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His dwelling is; there <i>Tethys</i> his wet bed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Doth euer wash, and <i>Cynthia</i> still doth steepe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed,<br>
Whiles sad Night ouer him her m&atilde;tle black doth spred<p>
 
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yuory,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The other all with siluer ouercast;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Watching to banish Care their enimy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And vnto <i>Morpheus</i> comes, whom drowned deepe<br>
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.<p>
 
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And euer-drizling raine vpon the loft,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,<br>
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.<p>
 
The messenger approching to him spake,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Is tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,<br>
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.<p>
 
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And threatned vnto him the dreaded name<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of <i>Hecate</i>: whereat he gan to quake,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And lifting vp his lompish head, with blame<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Hither (quoth he) me <i>Archimago</i> sent,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He bids thee to him send for his intent<br>
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.<p>
 
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A diuerse dreame out of his prison darke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Deliuered it to him, and downe did lay<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
His heauie head, deuoide of carefull carke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whose sences all were straight benumbd and starke.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He backe returning by the Yuorie dore,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Remounted vp as light as chearefull Larke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore<br>
In hast vnto his Lord, where he him left afore.<p>
 
Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Had made a Lady of that other Spright,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
So liuely, and so like in all mens sight,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That weaker sence it could haue rauisht quight:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her all in white he clad, and ouer it<br>
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for <i>Vna</i> fit.<p>
 
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vnto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Where he slept soundly void of euill thought,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In sort as he him schooled priuily:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And that new creature borne without her dew,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Full of the makers guile, with vsage sly<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He taught to imitate that Lady trew,<br>
Whose semblance she did carrie vnder feigned hew.<p>
 
Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And comming where the knight in slomber lay,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The one vpon his hardy head him plast,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And made him dreame of loues and lustfull play,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That nigh his manly hart did melt away,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,<br>
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.<p>
 
And she her selfe of beautie soueraigne Queene,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Faire <i>Venus</i> seemde vnto his bed to bring<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her, whom he waking euermore did weene,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Now a loose Leman to vile seruice bound:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And eke the <i>Graces</i> seemed all to sing,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>Hymen i&ocirc; Hymen</i>, dauncing all around,<br>
Whilst freshest <i>Flora</i> her with Yuie girlond crownd.<p>
 
In this great passion of vnwonted lust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He started vp, as seeming to mistrust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Lo there before his face his Lady is,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Vnder blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With gentle blandishment and louely looke,<br>
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.<p>
 
All cleane dismayd to see so vncouth sight,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He thought haue slaine her in his fierce despight:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe aduise<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To proue his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Tho can she weepe, to stirre vp gentle ruth,<br>
Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.<p>
 
And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my loue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And mightie causes wrought in heauen aboue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For hoped loue to winne me certaine hate?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
You, whom my hard auenging destinie<br>
Hath made iudge of my life or death indifferently.<p>
 
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leaue<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
My Fathers kingdome,--There she stopt with teares;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereaue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And then againe begun, My weaker yeares<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Captiu'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Let me not dye in languor and long teares.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Why Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?<br>
What frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?<p>
 
Loue of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Lets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In secret anguish and vnpittied plaint,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Suspect her truth: yet since no' vntruth he knew,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
He would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,<br>
That for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew.<p>
 
Assure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For all so deare as life is to my hart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
I deeme your loue, and hold me to you bound;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,<br>
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.<p>
 
Long after lay he musing at her mood,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Much grieu'd to thinke that gentle Dame so light,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For whose defence he was to shed his blood.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
At last dull wearinesse of former fight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But when he saw his labour all was vaine,<br>
With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.<p>
