*Cant. X.*

> *A chronicle of Briton kings,  
> from Brute to Vthers rayne.  
> And rolles of Elfin Emperours,  
> till time of Gloriane.*

> W Ho now shall giue vnto me words and sound,  
> Equall vnto this haughtie enterprise?  
> Or who shall lend me wings, with which from ground  
> Lowly verse may loftily arise,  
> And lift it selfe vnto the highest skies?  
> More ample spirit, then hitherto was wount,  
> Here needes me, whiles the famous auncestries  
> Of my most dreaded Soueraigne I recount,  
> By which all earthly Princes she doth farre surmount.
>
> Ne vnder Sunne, that shines so wide and faire,  
> Whence all that liues, does borrow life and light,  
> Liues ought, that to her linage may compaire,  
> Which though from earth it be deriued right,  
> Yet doth it selfe stretch forth to heauens hight,  
> And all the world with wonder ouerspred;  
> A labour huge, exceeding farre my might:  
> How shall fraile pen, with feare disparaged,  
> Conceiue such soueraine glory, and great bountihed?
>
> Argument worthy of *Moeonian* quill,  
> Or rather worthy of great *Phoebus* rote,  
> Whereon the ruines of great *Ossa* hill,  
> And triumphes of *Phlegræan Ioue* he wrote,  
> That all the Gods admird his loftie note.  
> But if some relish of that heauenly lay  
> His learned daughters would to me report,  
> To decke my song withall, I would assay,  
> Thy name, &ocirc: soueraine Queene, to blazon farre away.
>
> Thy name &ocirc: soueraine Queene, thy realme and race,  
> From this renowmed Prince deriued arre,  
> Who mightily vpheld that royall mace,  
> Which now thou bear'st, to thee descended farre  
> From mightie kings and conquerours in warre,  
> Thy fathers and great Grandfathers of old,  
> Whose noble deedes aboue the Northerne starre  
> Immortall fame for euer hath enrold;  
> As in that old mans booke they were in order told.
>
> The land, which warlike Britons now possesse,  
> And therein haue their mightie empire raysd,  
> In antique times was saluage wildernesse,  
> Vnpeopled, vnmanurd, vnprou'd, vnpraysd,  
> Ne was it Island then, ne was it paysd  
> Amid the *Ocean* waues, ne was it sought  
> Of marchants farre, for profits therein praysd,  
> But was all desolate, and of some thought  
> By sea to haue bene frõ the *Celticke* mayn-land brought.
>
> Ne did it then deserue a name to haue,  
> Till that the venturous Mariner that way  
> Learning his ship from those white rocks to saue,  
> Which all along the Southerne sea-coast lay,  
> Threatning vnheedie wrecke and rash decay,  
> For safeties sake that same his sea-marke made,  
> And named it *Albion*. But later day  
> Finding in it fit ports for fishers trade,  
> Gan more the same frequent, and further to inuade.
>
> But farre in land a saluage nation dwelt,  
> Of hideous Giants, and halfe beastly men,  
> That neuer tasted grace, nor goodnesse felt,  
> But like wild beasts lurking in loathsome den,  
> And flying fast as Roebucke through the fen,  
> All naked without shame, or care of cold,  
> By hunting and by spoiling liued then;  
> Of stature huge, and eke of courage bold,  
> That sonnes of men amazd their sternnesse to behold.
>
> But whence they sprong, or how they were begot,  
> Vneath is to assure; vneath to wene  
> That monstrous error, which doth some assot,  
> That *Dioclesians* fiftie daughters shene  
> Into this land by chaunce haue driuen bene,  
> Where companing with feends and filthy Sprights,  
> Through vaine illusion of their lust vnclene,  
> They brought forth Giants and such dreadfull wights,  
> As farre exceeded men in their immeasurd mights.
>
> They held this land, and with their filthinesse  
> Polluted this same gentle soyle long time:  
> That their owne mother loathd their beastlinesse,  
> And gan abhorre her broods vnkindly crime,  
> All were they borne of her owne natiue slime,  
> Vntill that *Brutus* anciently deriu'd  
> From royall stocke of old *Assaracs* line,  
> Driuen by fatall error, here arriu'd,  
> And them of their vniust possession depriu'd.
>
> But ere he had established his throne,  
> And spred his empire to the vtmost shore,  
> He fought great battels with his saluage fone;  
> In which he them defeated euermore,  
> And many Giants left on groning flore;  
> That well can witnesse yet vnto this day  
> The westerne Hogh, besprincled with the gore  
> Of mightie *Göemot*, whom in stout fray  
> *Corineus* conquered, and cruelly did slay.
>
> And eke that ample Pit, yet farre renownd,  
> For the large leape, which *Debon* did compell  
> *Coulin* to make, being eight lugs of grownd;  
> Into the which returning backe, he fell:  
> But those three monstrous stones doe most excell  
> Which that huge sonne of hideous *Albion*,  
> Whose father *Hercules* in Fraunce did quell,  
> Great *Godmer* threw, in fierce contention,  
> At bold *Canutus*; but of him was slaine anon.
>
> In meed of these great conquests by them got,  
> *Corineus* had that Prouince vtmost west,  
> To him assigned for his worthy lot,  
> Which of his name and memorable gest  
> He called *Cornewaile*, yet so called best:  
> And *Debons* shayre was, that is *Deuonshyre*:  
> But *Canute* had his portion from the rest,  
> The which he cald *Canutium*, for his hyre;  
> Now *Cantium*, which Kent we commenly inquire.
>
> Thus *Brute* this Realme vnto his rule subdewd,  
> And raigned long in great felicitie,  
> Lou'd of his friends, and of his foes eschewd,  
> He left three sonnes, his famous progeny,  
> Borne of faire *Inogene* of *Italy*;  
> Mongst whom he parted his imperiall state,  
> And *Locrine* left chiefe Lord of *Britany*.  
> At last ripe age bad him surrender late  
> His life, and long good fortune vnto finall fate.
>
> *Locrine* was left the soueraine Lord of all;  
> But *Albanact* had all the Northrene part,  
> Which of himselfe *Albania* he did call;  
> And *Camber* did possesse the Westerne quart,  
> Which *Seuerne* now from *Logris* doth depart:  
> And each his portion peaceably enioyd,  
> Ne was there outward breach, nor grudge in hart,  
> That once their quiet gouernment annoyd,  
> But each his paines to others profit still employd.
>
> Vntill a nation straung, with visage swart,  
> And courage fierce, that all men did affray,  
> Which through the world thẽ swarmd in euery part,  
> And ouerflow'd all countries farre away,  
> Like *Noyes* great flood, with their importune sway,  
> This land inuaded with like violence,  
> And did themselues through all the North display:  
> Vntill that *Locrine* for his Realmes defence,  
> Did head against them make, and strong munificence.
>
> He them encountred, a confused rout,  
> Foreby the Riuer, that whylome was hight  
> The auncient *Abus*, where with courage stout  
> He them defeated in victorious fight,  
> And chaste so fiercely after fearfull flight,  
> That forst their Chieftaine, for his safeties sake,  
> (Their Chieftaine *Humber* named was aright)  
> Vnto the mightie streame him to betake,  
> Where he an end of battell, and of life did make.
>
> The king returned proud of victorie,  
> And insolent wox through vnwonted ease,  
> That shortly he forgot the ieopardie,  
> Which in his land he lately did appease,  
> And fell to vaine voluptuous disease:  
> He lou'd faire Ladie *Estrild*, lewdly lou'd,  
> Whose wanton pleasures him too much did please.  
> That quite his hart from *Guendolene* remou'd,  
> Frõ *Guendolene* his wife, though alwaies faithfull prou'd.
>
> The noble daughter of *Corineus*  
> Would not endure to be so vile disdaind,  
> But gathering force, and courage valorous,  
> Encountred him in battell well ordaind,  
> In which him vanquisht she to fly constraind:  
> But she so fast pursewd, that him she tooke,  
> And threw in bands, where he till death remaind;  
> Als his faire Leman, flying through a brooke,  
> She ouerhent, nought moued with her piteous looke.
>
> But both her selfe, and eke her daughter deare,  
> Begotten by her kingly Paramoure,  
> The faire *Sabrina* almost dead with feare,  
> She there attached, farre from all succoure;  
> The one she slew in that impatient stoure,  
> But the sad virgin innocent of all,  
> Adowne the rolling riuer she did poure,  
> Which of her name now *Seuerne* men do call:  
> Such was the end, that to disloyall loue did fall.
>
> Then for her sonne, which she to *Locrin* bore,  
> *Madan* was young, vnmeet the rule of sway,  
> In her owne hande the crowne she kept in store,  
> Till ryper yeares he raught, and stronger stay:  
> During which time her powre she did display  
> Through all this realme, the glorie of her sex,  
> And first taught men a woman to obay:  
> But when her sonne to mans estate did wex,  
> She it surrendred, ne her selfe would lenger vex.
>
> Tho *Madan* raignd, vnworthie of his race:  
> For with all shame that sacred throne he fild:  
> Next *Memprise*, as vnworthy of that place,  
> In which being consorted with *Manild*,  
> For thirst of single kingdome him he kild.  
> But *Ebranck* salued both their infamies  
> With noble deedes, and warreyd on *Brunchild*  
> In *Henault*, where yet of his victories  
> Braue moniments remaine, which yet that land enuies.
>
> An happie man in his first dayes he was,  
> And happie father of faire progeny:  
> For all so many weekes as the yeare has,  
> So many children he did multiply;  
> Of which were twentie sonnes, which did apply,  
> Their minds to praise, and cheualrous desire:  
> Those germans did subdew all Germany,  
> Of whom it hight; but in the end their Sire  
> With foule repulse from Fraunce was forced to retire.
>
> Which blot his sonne succeeding in his seat,  
> The second *Brute*, the second both in name,  
> And eke in semblance of his puissance great,  
> Right well recur'd, and did away that blame  
> With recompence of euerlasting fame.  
> He with his victour sword first opened,  
> The bowels of wide Fraunce, a forlorne Dame,  
> And taught her first how to be conquered;  
> Since which, with sundrie spoiles she hath beene ransacked.
>
> Let *Scaldis* tell, and let tell *Hania*,  
> And let the marsh of *Estham bruges* tell,  
> What colour were their waters that same day,  
> And all the moore twixt *Eluersham* and *Dell*,  
> With bloud of *Henalois*, which therein fell.  
> How oft that day did sad *Brunchildis* see  
> The greene shield dyde in dolorous vermell?  
> That not *Scuith guiridh* it mote seeme to bee  
> But rather *y Scuith gogh*, signe of sad crueltee.
>
> His sonne king *Leill* by fathers labour long,  
> Enioyd an heritage of lasting peace,  
> And built *Cairleill*, and built *Cairleon* strong.  
> Next *Huddibras* his realme did not encrease,  
> But taught the land from wearie warres to cease.  
> Whose footsteps *Bladud* following in arts  
> Exceld at *Athens* all the learned preace,  
> From whence he brought them to these saluage parts,  
> And with sweet science mollifide their stubborne harts.
>
> Ensample of his wondrous faculty,  
> Behold the boyling Bathes at *Cairbadon*,  
> Which seeth with secret fire eternally,  
> And in their entrails, full of quicke Brimston,  
> Nourish the flames, which they are warm'd vpon,  
> That to their people wealth they forth do well,  
> And health to euery forreine nation:  
> Yet he at last contending to excell  
> The reach of men, through flight into fond mischief fell.
>
> Next him king *Leyr* in happie peace long raind,  
> But had no issue male him to succeed,  
> But three faire daughters, which were well vptraind,  
> In all that seemed fit for kingly seed:  
> Mongst whom his realme he equally decreed  
> To have diuided. Tho when feeble age  
> Nigh to his vtmost date he saw proceed,  
> He cald his daughters; and with speeches sage  
> Inquyrd, which of them most did loue her parentage.
>
> The eldest *Gonorill* gan to protest,  
> That she much more then her owne life him lou'd:  
> And *Regan* greater loue to him profest,  
> Then all the world, when euer it were proou'd;  
> But *Cordeill* said she lou'd him, as behoou'd:  
> Whose simple answere, wanting colours faire  
> To paint it forth, him to displeasance moou'd,  
> That in his crowne he counted her no haire,  
> But twixt the other twaine his kingdome whole did shaire.
>
> So wedded th'one to *Maglan* king of Scots,  
> And th'other to the king of *Cambria*,  
> And twixt them shayrd his realme by equall lots:  
> But without dowre the wise *Cordelia*  
> Was sent to *Aganip* of *Celtica*.  
> Their aged Syre, thus eased of his crowne,  
> A priuate life led in *Albania*,  
> With *Gonorill*, long had in great renowne,  
> That nought him grieu'd to bene from rule deposed downe.
>
> But true it is, that when the oyle is spent,  
> The light goes out, and weeke is throwne away;  
> So when he had resigned his regiment,  
> His daughter gan despise his drouping day,  
> And wearie waxe of his continuall stay.  
> Tho to his daughter *Rigan* he repayrd,  
> Who him at first well vsed euery way;  
> But when of his departure she despayrd,  
> Her bountie she abated, and his cheare empayrd.
>
> The wretched man gan then auise too late,  
> That loue is not, where most it is profest,  
> Too truely tryde in his extreamest state;  
> At last resolu'd likewise to proue the rest,  
> He to *Cordelia* him selfe addrest,  
> Who with entire affection him receau'd,  
> As for her Syre and king her seemed best;  
> And after all an army strong she leau'd,  
> To war on those, which him had of his realme bereau'd.
>
> So to his crowne she him restor'd againe,  
> In which he dyde, made ripe for death by eld,  
> And after wild, it should to her remaine:  
> Who peaceably the same long time did weld:  
> And all mens harts in dew obedience held:  
> Till that her sisters children, woxen strong  
> Through proud ambition, against her rebeld,  
> And ouercommen kept in prison long,  
> Till wearie of that wretched life, her selfe she hong.
>
> Then gan the bloudie brethren both to raine:  
> But fierce *Cundah* gan shortly to enuie  
> His brother *Morgan*, prickt with proud disdaine,  
> To haue a pere in part of soueraintie,  
> And kindling coles of cruell enmitie,  
> Raisd warre, and him in battell ouerthrew:  
> Whence as he to those woodie hils did flie,  
> Which hight of him *Glamorgan*, there him slew:  
> Then did he raigne alone, when he none equall knew.
>
> His sonne *Riuallo* his dead roome did supply,  
> In whose sad time bloud did from heauen raine:  
> Next great *Gurgustus*, then faire *Cæcily*  
> In constant peace their kingdomes did containe,  
> After whom *Lago*, and *Kinmarke* did raine,  
> And *Gorbogud*, till farre in yeares he grew:  
> Then his ambitious sonnes vnto them twaine  
> Arraught the rule, and from their father drew,  
> Stout *Ferrex* and sterne *Porrex* him in prison threw.
>
> But &ocirc:, the greedy thirst of royall crowne,  
> That knowes no kinred, nor regardes no right,  
> Stird *Porrex* vp to put his brother downe;  
> Who vnto him assembling forreine might,  
> Made warre on him, and fell him selfe in fight:  
> Whose death t'auenge, his mother mercilesse,  
> Most mercilesse of women, *VVyden* hight,  
> Her other sonne fast sleeping did oppresse,  
> And with most cruell hand him murdred pittilesse.
>
> Here ended *Brutus* sacred progenie,  
> Which had seuen hundred yeares this scepter borne,  
> With high renowme, and great felicitie?  
> The noble braunch from th'antique stocke was torne  
> Through discord, and the royall throne forlorne:  
> Thenceforth this Realme was into factions rent,  
> Whilest each of *Brutus* boasted to be borne,  
> That in the end was left no moniment  
> Of *Brutus*, nor of Britons glory auncient.
>
> Then vp arose a man of matchlesse might,  
> And wondrous wit to menage high affaires,  
> Who stird with pitty of the stressed plight  
> Of this sad Realme, cut into sundry shaires  
> By such, as claymd themselues *Brutes* rightfull haires,  
> Gathered the Princes of the people loose,  
> To taken counsell of their common cares;  
> Who with his wisedom won, him streight did choose  
> Their king, and swore him fealty to win or loose.
>
> Then made he head against his enimies,  
> And *Ymner* slew, or *Logris* miscreate;  
> Then *Ruddoc* and proud *Stater*, both allyes,  
> This of *Albanie* newly nominate,  
> And that of *Cambry* king confirmed late,  
> He ouerthrew through his owne valiaunce;  
> Whose countreis he redus'd to quiet state,  
> And shortly brought to ciuill gouernaunce,  
> Now one, which earst were many, made through variaunce.
>
> Then made he sacred lawes, which some men say  
> Were vnto him reueald in vision,  
> By which he freed the Traueilers high way,  
> The Churches part, and Ploughmans portion,  
> Restraining stealth, and strong extortion;  
> The gracious *Numa* of great *Britanie*:  
> For till his dayes, the chiefe dominion  
> By strength was wielded without pollicie;  
> Therefore he first wore crowne of gold for dignitie.
>
> *Donwallo* dyde (for what may liue for ay?)  
> And left two sonnes, of pearelesse prowesse both;  
> That sacked *Rome* too dearely did assay,  
> The recompence of their periured oth,

> Besides subiected *Fraunce*, and *Germany*,  
> Which yet their prayses speake, all be they loth,

>
> Next them did *Gurgunt*, great *Bellinus* sonne  
> In rule succeede, and eke in fathers prayse;  
> He Easterland subdewd, and Danmarke wonne,  
> And of them both did foy and tribute raise,

> Whom he at sea found wandring from their wayes,  
> A seate in *Ireland* safely to remayne,  
> Which they should hold of him, as subiect to *Britayne*.
>
> After him raigned *Guitheline* his hayre,  
> The iustest man and trewest in his dayes,  
> Who had to wife Dame *Mertia* the fayre,  
> A woman worthy of immortall prayse,  
> Which for this Realme found many goodly layes,

> Her sonne *Sisillus* after her did rayne,

> As well in that same field victorious  
> Against the forreine *Morands* he exprest;  
> Yet liues his memorie, though carcas sleepe in rest.
>
> Fiue sonnes he left begotten of one wife,  
> All which successiuely by turnes did raine;  
> First *Gorboman* a man of vertuous life;  
> Next *Archigald*, who for his proud disdaine,  
> Deposed was from Princedome soueraine,  
> And pitteous *Elidure* put in his sted;  
> Who shortly it to him restord againe,  
> Till by his death he it recouered;  
> But *Peridure* and *Vigent* him disthronized.
>
> In wretched prison long he did remaine,  
> Till they outraigned had their vtmost date,  
> And then therein reseized was againe,  
> And ruled long with honorable state,  
> Till he surrendred Realme and life to fate.  
> Then all the sonnes of these fiue brethren raynd

> Euen thrise eleuen descents the crowne retaynd,  
> Till aged *Hely* by dew heritage it gaynd.
>
> He had two sonnes, whose eldest called *Lud*  
> Left of his life most famous memory,  
> And endlesse moniments of his great good:  
> The ruin'd wals he did reædifye  
> Of *Troynouant*, gainst force of enimy,  
> And built that gate, which of his name is hight,

>
> Whilst they were young, *Cassibalane* their Eme  
> Was by the people chosen in their sted,  
> Who on him tooke the royall Diademe,  
> And goodly well long time it gouerned,  
> Till the prowd *Romanes* him disquieted,  
> And warlike *Caesar*, tempted with the name

> Yet twise they were repulsed backe againe,

> So by him *Caesar* got the victory,  
> Through great bloudshed, and many a sad assay,  
> In which him selfe was charged heauily  
> Of hardy *Nennius*, whom he yet did slay,  
> But lost his sword, yet to be seene this day.  
> Thenceforth this land was tributarie made

> Next him *Tenantius* raigned, then *Kimbeline*,  
> What time th'eternall Lord in fleshly slime

> Good *Claudius*, that next was Emperour,

> By this the sonnes of *Constantine*, which fled,

> After him *Vther*, which *Pendragon* hight,

> Yet secret pleasure did offence empeach,  
> And wonder of antiquitie long stopt his speach.
>
> At last quite rauisht with delight, to heare  
> The royall Ofspring of his natiue land,  
> Cryde out, Deare countrey, &ocirc: how dearely deare  
> Ought thy remembraunce, and perpetuall band  
> Be to thy foster Childe, that from thy hand  
> Did commun breath and nouriture receaue?  
> How brutish is it not to vnderstand,  
> How much to her we owe, that all vs gaue,  
> That gaue vnto vs all, what euer good we haue.
>
> But *Guyon* all this while his booke did read,  
> Ne yet has ended: for it was a great  
> And ample volume, that doth far excead  
> My leasure, so long leaues here to repeat:  
> It told, how first *Prometheus* did create  
> A man, of many partes from beasts deriued,  
> And then stole fire from heauen, to animate  
> His worke, for which he was by *Ioue* depriued  
> Of life him selfe, and hart-strings of an Ægle riued.
>
> That man so made, he called *Elfe*, to weet  
> Quick, the first authour of all Elfin kind:  
> Who wandring through the world with wearie feet,  
> Did in the gardins of *Adonis* find  
> A goodly creature, whom he deemd in mind  
> To be no earthly wight, but either Spright,  
> Or Angell, th'authour of all woman kind;  
> Therefore a *Fay* he her according hight,  
> Of whom all *Faeryes* spring, and fetch their lignage right.
>
> Of these a mightie people shortly grew,  
> And puissaunt kings, which all the world warrayd,  
> And to them selues all Nations did subdew:  
> The first and eldest, which that scepter swayd,  
> Was *Elfin*; him all *India* obayd,  
> And all that now *America* men call:  
> Next him was noble *Elfinan*, who layd  
> *Cleopolis* foundation first of all:  
> But *Elfiline* enclosd it with a golden wall.
>
> His sonne was *Elfinell*, who ouercame  
> The wicked *Gobbelines* in bloudy field:  
> But *Elfant* was of most renowmed fame,  
> Who all of Christall did *Panthea* build:  
> Then *Elfar*, who two brethren gyants kild,  
> The one of which had two heads, th'other three:  
> Then *Elfinor*, who was in Magick skild;  
> He built by art vpon the glassy See  
> A bridge of bras, whose sound heauẽs thunder seem'd to bee.
>
> He left three sonnes, the which in order raynd,  
> And all their Ofspring, in their dew descents,  
> Euen seuen hundred Princes, which maintaynd  
> With mightie deedes their sundry gouernments;  
> That were too long their infinite contents  
> Here to record, ne much materiall:  
> Yet should they be most famous moniments,  
> And braue ensample, both of martiall,  
> And ciuill rule to kings and states imperiall.
>
> After all these *Elficleos* did rayne,  
> The wise *Elficleos* in great Maiestie,  
> Who mightily that scepter did sustayne,  
> And with rich spoiles and famous victorie,  
> Did high aduaunce the crowne of *Faery*:  
> He left two sonnes, of which faire *Elferon*  
> The eldest brother did vntimely dy;  
> Whose emptie place the mightie *Oberon*  
> Doubly supplide, in spousall, and dominion.
>
> Great was his power and glorie ouer all,  
> Which him before, that sacred seate did fill,  
> That yet remaines his wide memoriall:  
> He dying left the fairest *Tanaquill*,  
> Him to succeede therein, by his last will:  
> Fairer and nobler liueth none this howre,  
> Ne like in grace, ne like in learned skill;  
> Therefore they *Glorian* call that glorious flowre,  
> Long mayst thou *Glorian* liue, in glory and great powre.
>
> Beguild thus with delight of nouelties,  
> And naturall desire of countreys state,  
> So long they red in those antiquities,  
> That how the time was fled, they quite forgate,  
> Till gentle *Alma* seeing it so late,  
> Perforce their studies broke, and them besought  
> To thinke, how supper did them long awaite.  
> So halfe vnwilling from their bookes them brought,  
> And fairely feasted, as so noble knights she ought.
