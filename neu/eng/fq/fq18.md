*Cant. V.*

> *Pyrrochles does with Guyon fight,  
> And Furors chayne vnbinds  
> Of whom sore hurt, for his reuenge  
> Atin Cymochles finds.*

> W Ho euer doth to temperaunce apply  
> His stedfast life, and all his actions frame,  
> Trust me, shall find no greater enimy,  
> Then stubborne perturbation, to the same;  
> To which right well the wise do giue that name,  
> For it the goodly peace of stayed mindes  
> Does ouerthrow, and troublous warre proclame:  
> His owne woes authour, who so bound it findes,  
> As did *Pyrrochles*, and it wilfully vnbindes.
>
> After that varlets flight, it was not long,  
> Ere on the plaine fast pricking *Guyon* spide  
> One in bright armes embatteiled full strong,  
> That as the Sunny beames do glaunce and glide  
> Vpon the trembling waue, so shined bright,  
> And round about him threw forth sparkling fire,  
> That seemd him to enflame on euery side:  
> His steed was bloudy red, and fomed ire,  
> When with the maistring spur he did him roughly stire.
>
> Approching nigh, he neuer stayd to greete,  
> Ne chaffar words, prowd courage to prouoke,  
> But prickt so fiers, that vnderneath his feete  
> The smouldring dust did round about him smoke,  
> Both horse and man nigh able for to choke;  
> And fairly couching his steele-headed speare,  
> Him first saluted with a sturdy stroke;  
> It booted nought Sir *Guyon* comming neare  
> To thinke, such hideous puissaunce on foot to beare.
>
> But lightly shunned it, and passing by,  
> With his bright blade did smite at him so fell,  
> That the sharpe steele arriuing forcibly  
> On his broad shield, bit not, but glauncing fell  
> On his horse necke before the quilted sell,  
> And from the head the body sundred quight.  
> So him dismounted low, he did compell  
> On foot with him to matchen equall fight;  
> The truncked beast fast bleeding, did him fowly dight.
>
> Sore bruzed with the fall, he slow vprose,  
> And all enraged, thus him loudly shent;  
> Disleall knight, whose coward courage chose  
> To wreake it selfe on beast all innocent,  
> And shund the marke, at which it should be ment,  
> Thereby thine armes seeme strõg, but manhood fraile;  
> So hast thou oft with guile thine honour blent;  
> But litle may such guile thee now auaile,  
> If wonted force and fortune do not much me faile.
>
> With that he drew his flaming sword, and strooke  
> At him so fiercely, that the vpper marge  
> Of his seuenfolded shield away it tooke,  
> And glauncing on his helmet, made a large  
> And open gash therein: were not his targe,  
> That broke the violence of his intent,  
> The weary soule from thence it would discharge;  
> Nathelesse so sore abuff to him it lent,  
> That made him reele, and to his brest his beuer bent.
>
> Exceeding wroth was *Guyon* at that blow,  
> And much ashamd, that stroke of liuing arme  
> Should him dismay, and make him stoup so low,  
> Though otherwise it did him litle harme:  
> Tho hurling high his yron braced arme,  
> He smote so manly on his shoulder plate,  
> That all his left side it did quite disarme;  
> Yet there the steele stayd not, but inly bate  
> Deepe in his flesh, and opened wide a red floodgate.
>
> Deadly dismayd, with horrour of that dint  
> *Pyrrochles* was, and grieued eke entyre;  
> Yet nathemore did it his fury stint,  
> But added flame vnto his former fire,  
> That welnigh molt his hart in raging yre,  
> Ne thenceforth his approued skill, to ward,  
> Or strike, or hurle, round in warelike gyre,  
> Remembred he, ne car'd for his saufgard,  
> But rudely rag'd, and like a cruell Tygre far'd.
>
> He hewd, and lasht, and foynd, and thundred blowes,  
> And euery way did seeke into his life,  
> Ne plate, ne male could ward so mighty throwes,  
> But yielded passage to his cruell knife.  
> But *Guyon*, in the heat of all his strife,  
> Was warie wise, and closely did awayt  
> Auauntage, whilest his foe did rage most rife;  
> Sometimes a thwart, sometimes he strooke him strayt,  
> And falsed oft his blowes, t'illude him with such bayt.
>
> Like as a Lyon, whose imperiall powre  
> A prowd rebellious Vnicorne defies,  
> T'auoide the rash assault and wrathfull stowre  
> Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applies,  
> And when him running in full course he spies,  
> He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast  
> His precious horne, sought of his enimies  
> Strikes in the stocke, ne thence can be rel\[e\]ast,  
> But to the mighty victour yields a bounteous feast.
>
> With such faire slight him *Guyon* often faild,  
> Till at the last all breathlesse, wearie, faint  
> Him spying, with fresh onset he assaild,  
> And kindling new his courage seeming queint,  
> Strooke him so hugely, that through great constraint  
> He made him stoup perforce vnto his knee,  
> And do vnwilling worship to the Saint,  
> That on his shield depainted he did see;  
> Such homage till that instant neuer learned hee.
>
> Whom *Guyon* seeing stoup, pursewed fast  
> The present offer of faire victory.  
> And soone his dreadfull blade about he cast,  
> Wherewith he smote his haughty crest so hye,  
> That streight on ground made him full low to lye;  
> Then on his brest his victour foote he thrust:  
> With that he cryde, Mercy, do me not dye,  
> Ne deeme thy force by fortunes doome vniust,  
> That hath (maugre her spight) thus low me laid in dust.
>
> Eftsoones his cruell hand Sir *Guyon* stayd,  
> Tempring the passion with aduizement slow,  
> And maistring might on enimy dismayd:  
> For th'equall dye of warre he well did know;  
> Then to him said, Liue and allegaunce owe,  
> To him that giues thee life and libertie,  
> And henceforth by this dayes ensample trow,  
> That hasty wroth, and heedlesse hazardrie,  
> Do breede repentaunce late, and lasting infamie.
>
> So vp he let him rise, who with grim looke  
> And count'naunce sterne vpstanding, gan to grind  
> His grated teeth for great disdeigne, and shooke  
> His sandy lockes, long hanging downe behind,  
> Knotted in bloud and dust, for griefe of mind,  
> That he in ods of armes was conquered;  
> Yet in himselfe some comfort he did find,  
> That him so noble knight had maistered,  
> Whose bounty more then might, yet both he wondered.
>
> Which *Guyon* marking said, Be nought agrieu'd,  
> Sir Knight, that thus ye now subdewed arre:  
> Was neuer man, who most conquestes atchieu'd  
> But sometimes had the worse, and lost by warre,  
> Yet shortly gaynd, that losse exceeded farre:  
> Losse is no shame, nor to be lesse then foe,  
> But to be lesser, then himselfe, doth marre  
> Both loosers lot, and victours prayse alsoe.  
> Vaine others ouerthrowes, who selfe doth ouerthrowe.
>
> Fly, O *Pyrrochles*, fly the dreadfull warre,  
> That in thy selfe thy lesser parts do moue,  
> Outrageous anger, and woe-working iarre,  
> Direfull impatience, and hart murdring loue;  
> Those, those thy foes, those warriours far remoue,  
> Which thee to endlesse bale captiued lead.  
> But sith in might thou didst my mercy proue,  
> Of curtesie to me the cause a read,  
> That thee against me drew with so impetuous dread.
>
> Dreadlesse (said he) that shall I soone declare:  
> It was complaind, that thou hadst done great tort  
> Vnto an aged woman, poore and bare,  
> And thralled her in chaines with strong effort,  
> Voide of all succour and needfull comfort:  
> That ill beseemes thee, such as I thee see,  
> To worke such shame. Therefore I thee exhort,  
> To chaunge thy will, and set *Occasion* free,  
> And to her captiue sonne yield his first libertee.
>
> Thereat Sir *Guyon* smilde, And is that all  
> (Said he) that thee so sore displeased hath?  
> Great mercy sure, for to enlarge a thrall,  
> Whose freedome shall thee turne to greatest scath.  
> Nath'lesse now quench thy whot emboyling wrath:  
> Loe there they be; to thee I yield them free.  
> Thereat he wondrous glad, out of the path  
> Did lightly leape, where he them bound did see,  
> And gan to breake the bands of their captiuitee.
>
> Soone as *Occasion* felt her selfe vntyde,  
> Before her sonne could well assoyled bee,  
> She to her vse returnd, and streight defyde  
> Both *Guyon* and *Pyrrochles*: th'one (said shee)  
> Bycause he wonne; the other because hee  
> Was wonne: So matter did she make of nought,  
> To stirre vp strife, and do them disagree;  
> But soone as *Furor* was enlargd, she sought  
> To kindle his quencht fire, and thousand causes wrought.
>
> It was not long, ere she inflam'd him so,  
> That he would algates with *Pyrrochles* fight,  
> And his redeemer chalengd for his foe,  
> Because he had not well mainteind his right,  
> But yielded had to that same straunger knight:  
> Now gan *Pyrrochles* wex as wood, as hee,  
> And him affronted with impatient might:  
> So both together fiers engrasped bee,  
> Whiles *Guyon* standing by, their vncouth strife does see.
>
> Him all that while *Occasion* did prouoke  
> Against *Pyrrochles*, and new matter framed  
> Vpon the old, him stirring to be wroke  
> Of his late wrongs, in which she oft him blamed  
> For suffering such abuse, as knighhood shamed,  
> And him dishabled quite. But he was wise  
> Ne would with vaine occasions be inflamed;  
> Yet others she more vrgent did deuise:  
> Yet nothing could him to impatience entise.
>
> Their fell contention still increased more,  
> And more thereby increased *Furors* might,  
> That he his foe has hurt, and wounded sore,  
> And him in bloud and durt deformed quight.  
> His mother eke, more to augment his spight,  
> Now brought to him a flaming fire brond,  
> Which she in *Stygian* lake, ay burning bright,  
> Had kindled: that she gaue into his hond,  
> That armd with fire, more hardly he mote him withstõd.
>
> Tho gan that villein wex so fiers and strong,  
> That nothing might sustaine his furious forse;  
> He cast him downe to ground, and all along  
> Drew him through durt and myre without remorse,  
> And fowly battered his comely corse,  
> That *Guyon* much disdeignd so loathly sight.  
> At last he was compeld to cry perforse,  
> Helpe, ô Sir *Guyon*, helpe most noble knight,  
> To rid a wretched man from hands of hellish wight.
>
> The knight was greatly moued at his plaint,  
> And gan him dight to succour his distresse,  
> Till that the Palmer, by his graue restraint,  
> Him stayd from yielding pitifull redresse;  
> And said, Deare sonne, thy causelesse ruth represse,  
> Ne let thy stout hart melt in pitty vayne:  
> He that his sorrow sought through wilfulnesse,  
> And his foe fettred would release agayne,  
> Deserues to tast his follies fruit, repented payne.
>
> *Guyon* obayd; So him away he drew  
> From needlesse trouble of renewing fight  
> Already fought, his voyage to pursew.  
> But rash *Pyrrochles* varlet, *Atin* hight,  
> When late he saw his Lord in heauy plight,  
> Vnder Sir *Guyons* puissaunt stroke to fall,  
> Him deeming dead, as then he seemd in sight,  
> Fled fast away, to tell his funerall  
> Vnto his brother, whom *Cymochles* men did call.
>
> He was a man of rare redoubted might,  
> Famous throughout the world for warlike prayse,  
> And glorious spoiles, purchast in perilous fight:  
> Full many doughtie knights he in his dayes  
> Had doen to death, subdewde in equall frayes,  
> Whose carkases, for terrour of his name,  
> Of fowles and beastes he made the piteous prayes,  
> And hong their conquered armes for more defame  
> On gallow trees, in honour of his dearest Dame.
>
> His dearest Dame is that Enchaunteresse,  
> The vile *Acrasia*, that with vaine delightes,  
> And idle pleasures in his\[her\] *Bowre* of *Blisse*,  
> Does charme her louers, and the feeble sprightes  
> Can call out of the bodies of fraile wightes:  
> Whom then she does transforme to mõstrous hewes,  
> And horribly misshapes with vgly sightes,  
> Captiu'd eternally in yron mewes,  
> And darksom dens, where *Titan* his face neuer shewes.
>
> There *Atin* found *Cymochles* soiourning,  
> To serue his Lemans loue: for he, by kind,  
> Was giuen all to lust and loose liuing,  
> When euer his fiers hands he free mote find:  
> And now he has pourd out his idle mind  
> In daintie delices, and lauish ioyes,  
> Hauing his warlike weapons cast behind,  
> And flowes in pleasures, and vaine pleasing toyes,  
> Mingled emongst loose Ladies and lasciuious boyes.
>
> And ouer him, art striuing to compaire  
> With nature, did an Arber greene dispred,  
> Framed of wanton Yuie, flouring faire,  
> Through which the fragrant Eglantine did spred  
> His pricking armes, entrayld with roses red,  
> Which daintie odours round about them threw,  
> And all within with flowres was garnished,  
> That when myld *Zephyrus* emongst them blew,  
> Did breath out bounteous smels, & painted colors shew.
>
> And fast beside, there trickled softly downe  
> A gentle streame, whose murmuring waue did play  
> Emongst the pumy stones, and made a sowne,  
> To lull him soft a sleepe, that by it lay;  
> The wearie Traueiler, wandring that way,  
> Therein did often quench his thristy heat,  
> And then by it his wearie limbes display,  
> Whiles creeping slomber made him to forget  
> His former paine, and wypt away his toylsoms weat.
>
> And on the other side a pleasaunt groue  
> Was shot vp high, full of the stately tree,  
> That dedicated is t'*Olympicke Ioue*,  
> And to his sonne *Alcides*, whenas hee  
> Gaynd in *Nemea* goodly victoree;  
> Therein the mery birds of euery sort  
> Chaunted alowd their chearefull harmonie:  
> And made emongst them selues a sweet consort,  
> That quickned the dull spright with musicall comfort.
>
> There he him found all carelesly displayd,  
> In secret shadow from the sunny ray,  
> On a sweet bed of lillies softly layd,  
> Amidst a flocke of Damzels fresh and gay,  
> That round about him dissolute did play  
> Their wanton follies, and light meriment;  
> Euery of which did loosely disaray  
> Her vpper parts of meet habiliments,  
> And shewd them naked, deckt with many ornaments.
>
> And euery of them stroue, with most delights,  
> Him to aggrate, and greatest pleasures shew;  
> Some framd faire lookes, glancing like euening lights,  
> Others sweet words, dropping like honny dew;  
> Some bathed kisses, and did soft embrew,  
> The sugred licour through his melting lips:  
> One boastes her beautie, and does yeeld to vew  
> Her daintie limbes aboue her tender hips,  
> Another her out boastes, and all for tryall strips.
>
> He, like an Adder, lurking in the weeds,  
> His wandring thought in deepe desire does steepe,  
> And his fraile eye with spoyle of beautie feedes;  
> Sometimes he falsely faines himselfe to sleepe,  
> Whiles through their lids his wanton eies do peepe,  
> To steale a snatch of amorous conceipt,  
> Whereby close fire into his heart does creepe:  
> So, them deceiues, deceiu'd in his deceipt,  
> Made drunke with drugs of deare voluptuous receipt.
>
> *Atin* arriuing there, when him he spide,  
> Thus in still waues of deepe delight to wade,  
> Fiercely approching, to him lowdly cride,  
> *Cymochles*; oh no, but *Cymochles* shade,  
> In which that manly person late did fade,  
> What is become of great *Acrates* sonne?  
> Or where hath he hong vp his mortall blade,  
> That hath so many haughtie conquests wonne?  
> Is all his force forlorne, and all his glory donne?
>
> Then pricking him with his sharpe-pointed dart,  
> He said? Vp, vp, thou womanish weake knight,  
> That here in Ladies lap entombed art,  
> Vnmindfull of thy praise and prowest might,  
> And weetlesse eke of lately wrought despight,  
> Whiles sad *Pyrrochles* lies on senselesse ground,  
> And groneth out his vtmost grudging spright,  
> Through many a stroke, & many a streaming wound,  
> Calling thy helpe in vaine, that here in ioyes art dround.
>
> Suddeinly out of his delightfull dreame  
> The man awoke, and would haue questiond more;  
> But he would not endure that wofull theame  
> For to dilate at large, but vrged sore  
> With percing words, and pittifull implore,  
> Him hastie to arise. As one affright  
> With hellish feends, or *Furies* mad vprore,  
> He then vprose, inflam'd with fell despight,  
> And called for his armes; for he would algates fight.
>
> They bene ybrought; he quickly does him dight,  
> And lightly mounted, passeth on his way,  
> Ne Ladies loues, ne sweete entreaties might  
> Appease his heat, or hastie passage stay;  
> For he has vowd, to beene aueng'd that day,  
> (That day it selfe him seemed all too long:)  
> On him, that did *Pyrrochles* deare dismay:  
> So proudly pricketh on his courser strong,  
> And *Atin* aie him pricks with spurs of shame & wrong.
