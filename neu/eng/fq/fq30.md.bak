*Cant. IIII.*

> *Bold Marinell of Britomart,  
> Is throwne on the Rich strond:  
> Faire Florimell of Arthur is  
> Long followed, but not fond.*

> VV Here is the Antique glory now become,  
> That whilome wont in women to appeare?  
> Where be the braue atchieuements doen by some?  
> Where be the battels, where the shield and speare,  
> And all the conquests, which them high did reare,  
> That matter made for famous Poets verse,  
> And boastfull men so oft abasht to heare?  
> Bene they all dead, and laid in dolefull herse?  
> Or doen they onely sleepe, and shall againe reuerse?
>
> If they be dead, then woe is me therefore:  
> But if they sleepe, ô let them soone awake:  
> For all too long I burne with enuy sore,  
> To heare the warlike feates, which *Homere* spake  
> Of bold *Penthesilee*, which made a lake  
> Of *Greekish* bloud so oft in *Troian* plaine;  
> But when I read, how stout *Debora* strake  
> Proud *Sisera*, and how *Camill'* hath slaine  
> The huge *Orsilochus*, I swell with great disdaine.
>
> Yet these, and all that else had puissaunce,  
> Cannot with noble *Britomart* compare,  
> Aswell for glory of great valiaunce,  
> As for pure chastitie and vertue rare,  
> That all her goodly deeds do well declare.  
> Well worthy stock, from which the branches sprong,  
> That in late yeares so faire a blossome bare,  
> As thee, ô Queene, the matter of my song,  
> Whose lignage from this Lady I deriue along.
>
> Who when through speaches with the *Redcrosse* knight,  
> She learned had th'estate of *Arthegall*,  
> And in each point her selfe informd aright,  
> A friendly league of loue perpetuall  
> She with him bound, and *Congé* tooke withall.  
> Then he forth on his iourney did proceede,  
> To seeke aduentures, which mote him befall,  
> And win him worship through his warlike deed,  
> Which alwayes of his paines he made the chiefest meed.
>
> But *Britomart* kept on her former course,  
> Ne euer dofte her armes, but all the way  
> Grew pensiue through that amorous discourse,  
> By which the *Redcrosse* knight did earst display  
> Her louers shape, and cheualrous aray;  
> A thousand thoughts she fashioned in her mind,  
> And in her feigning fancie did pourtray  
> Him such, as fittest she for loue could find,  
> Wise, warlike, personable, curteous, and kind.
>
> With such selfe-pleasing thoughts her wound she fed,  
> And thought so to beguile her grieuous smart;  
> But so her smart was much more grieuous bred,  
> And the deepe wound more deepe engord her hart,  
> That nought but death her dolour mote depart.  
> So forth she rode without repose or rest,  
> Searching all lands and each remotest part,  
> Following the guidaunce of her blinded guest,  
> Till that to the sea-coast at length she her addrest.
>
> There she alighted from her light-foot beast,  
> And sitting downe vpon the rocky shore,  
> Bad her old Squire vnlace her lofty creast;  
> Tho hauing vewd a while the surges hore,  
> That gainst the craggy clifts did loudly rore,  
> And in their raging surquedry disdaynd,  
> That the fast earth affronted them so sore,  
> And their deuouring couetize restraynd,  
> Thereat she sighed deepe, and after thus complaynd.
>
> Huge sea of sorrow, and tempestuous griefe,  
> Wherein my feeble barke is tossed long,  
> Far from the hoped hauen of reliefe,  
> Why do thy cruell billowes beat so strong,  
> And thy moyst mountaines each on others throng,  
> Threatning to swallow vp my fearefull life?  
> O do thy cruell wrath and spightfull wrong  
> At length allay, and stint thy stormy strife,  
> Which in these troubled bowels raignes, & rageth rife.
>
> For else my feeble vessell crazd, and crackt  
> Through thy strong buffets and outrageous blowes,  
> Cannot endure, but needs it must be wrackt  
> On the rough rocks, or on the sandy shallowes,  
> The whiles that loue it steres, and fortune rowes;  
> Loue my lewd Pilot hath a restlesse mind  
> And fortune Boteswaine no assuraunce knowes,  
> But saile withouten starres gainst tide and wind:  
> How can they other do, sith both are bold and blind?
>
> Thou God of winds, that raignest in the seas,  
> That raignest also in the Continent,  
> At last blow vp some gentle gale of ease,  
> The which may bring my ship, ere it be rent,  
> Vnto the gladsome port of her intent:  
> Then when I shall my selfe in safety see,  
> A table for eternall moniment  
> Of thy great grace, and my great ieopardee,  
> Great *Neptune*, I auow to hallow vnto thee.
>
> Then sighing softly sore, and inly deepe,  
> She shut vp all her plaint in priuy griefe;  
> For her great courage would not let her weepe,  
> Till that old *Glauce* gan with sharpe repriefe,  
> Her to restraine, and giue her good reliefe,  
> Through hope of those, which *Merlin* had her told  
> Should of her name and nation be chiefe,  
> And fetch their being from the sacred mould  
> Of her immortall wombe, to be in heauen enrold.
>
> Thus as she her recomforted, she spyde,  
> Where farre away one all in armour bright,  
> With hastie gallop towards her did ryde;  
> Her dolour soone she ceast, and on her dight  
> Her Helmet, to her Courser mounting light:  
> Her former sorrow into suddein wrath,  
> Both coosen passions of distroubled spright,  
> Conuerting, forth she beates the dustie path;  
> Loue and despight attonce her courage kindled hath.
>
> As when a foggy mist hath ouercast  
> The face of heauen, and the cleare aire engrost,  
> The world in darkenesse dwels, till that at last  
> The watry Southwinde from the seabord cost  
> Vpblowing, doth disperse the vapour lo'st,  
> And poures it selfe forth in a stormy showre;  
> So the faire *Britomart* hauing disclo'st  
> Her clowdy care into a wrathfull stowre,  
> The mist of griefe dissolu'd, did into vengeance powre.
>
> Eftsoones her goodly shield addressing faire,  
> That mortall speare she in her hand did take,  
> And vnto battell did her selfe prepaire.  
> The knight approching, sternely her bespake;  
> Sir knight, that doest thy voyage rashly make  
> By this forbidden way in my despight,  
> Ne doest by others death ensample take,  
> I read thee soone retyre, whiles thou hast might,  
> Least afterwards it be too late to take thy flight.
>
> Ythrild with deepe disdaine of his proud threat,  
> She shortly thus; Fly they, that need to fly;  
> Words fearen babes. I meane not thee entreat  
> To passe; but maugre thee will passe or dy.  
> Ne lenger stayd for th'other to reply,  
> But with sharpe speare the rest made dearly knowne.  
> Strongly the straunge knight ran, and sturdily  
> Strooke her full on the brest, that made her downe  
> Decline her head, & touch her crouper with her crowne.
>
> But she againe him in the shield did smite,  
> With so fierce furie and great puissaunce,  
> That through his threesquare scuchin percing quite,  
> And through his mayled hauberque, by mischaunce  
> The wicked steele through his left side did glaunce;  
> Him so transfixed she before her bore  
> Beyond his croupe, the length of all her launce,  
> Till sadly soucing on the sandie shore,  
> He tombled on an heape, and wallowd in his gore.
>
> Like as the sacred Oxe, that carelesse stands,  
> With gilden hornes, and flowry girlonds crownd,  
> Proud of his dying honor and deare bands,  
> Whiles th'altars fume with frankincense arownd,  
> All suddenly with mortall stroke astownd,  
> Doth groueling fall, and with his streaming gore  
> Distaines the pillours, and the holy grownd,  
> And the faire flowres, that decked him afore;  
> So fell proud *Marinell* vpon the pretious shore.
>
> The martiall Mayd stayd not him to lament,  
> But forward rode, and kept her readie way  
> Along the strond, which as she ouer-went,  
> She saw bestrowed all with rich aray  
> Of pearles and pretious stones of great assay,  
> And all the grauell mixt with golden owre;  
> Whereat she wondred much, but would not stay  
> For gold, or perles, or pretious stones an howre,  
> But them despised all; for all was in her powre.
>
> Whiles thus he lay in deadly stonishment,  
> Tydings hereof came to his mothers eare;  
> His mother was the blacke-browd *Cymoent*,  
> The daughter of great *Nereus*, which did beare  
> This warlike sonne vnto an earthly peare,  
> The famous *Dumarin*; who on a day  
> Finding the Nymph a sleepe in secret wheare,  
> As he by chaunce did wander that same way,  
> Was taken with her loue, and by her closely lay.
>
> There he this knight of her begot, whom borne  
> She of his father *Marinell* did name,  
> And in a rocky caue as wight forlorne,  
> Long time she fostred vp, till he became  
> A mightie man at armes, and mickle fame  
> Did get through great aduentures by him donne:  
> For neuer man he suffred by that same  
> *Rich strond* to trauell, whereas he did wonne,  
> But that he must do battell with the Sea-nymphes sonne.
>
> An hundred knights of honorable name  
> He had subdew'd and them his vassals made,  
> That through all Farie lond his noble fame  
> Now blazed was, and feare did all inuade,  
> That none durst passen through that perilous glade.  
> And to aduance his name and glorie more,  
> Her Sea-god syre she dearely did perswade,  
> T'endow her sonne with threasure and rich store,  
> Boue all the sonnes, that were of earthly wombes ybore.
>
> The God did graunt his daughters deare demaund,  
> To doen his Nephew in all riches flow;  
> Eftsoones his heaped waues he did commaund,  
> Out of their hollow bosome forth to throw  
> All the huge threasure, which the sea below  
> Had in his greedie gulfe deuoured deepe,  
> And him enriched through the ouerthrow  
> And wreckes of many wretches, which did weepe,  
> And often waile their wealth, which he from them did keepe.
>
> Shortly vpon that shore there heaped was,  
> Exceeding riches and all pretious things,  
> The spoyle of all the world, that it did pas  
> The wealth of th'East, and pompe of *Persian* kings;  
> Gold, amber, yuorie, perles, owches, rings,  
> And all that else was pretious and deare,  
> The sea vnto him voluntary brings,  
> That shortly he a great Lord did appeare,  
> As was in all the lond of Faery, or elsewheare.
>
> Thereto he was a doughtie dreaded knight,  
> Tryde often to the scath of many deare,  
> That none in equall armes him matchen might,  
> The which his mother seeing, gan to feare  
> Least his too haughtie hardines might reare  
> Some hard mishap, in hazard of his life:  
> For thy she oft him counseld to forbeare  
> The bloudie battell, and to stirre vp strife,  
> But after all his warre, to rest his wearie knife.
>
> And for his more assurance, she inquir'd  
> One day of *Proteus* by his mightie spell,  
> (For *Proteus* was with prophecie inspir'd)  
> Her deare sonnes destinie to her to tell,  
> And the sad end of her sweet *Marinell*.  
> Who through foresight of his eternall skill,  
> Bad her from womankind to keepe him well:  
> For of a woman he should haue much ill,  
> A virgin strange and stout him should dismay, or kill.
>
> For thy she gaue him warning euery day,  
> The loue of women not to entertaine;  
> A lesson too too hard for liuing clay,  
> From loue in course of nature to refraine:  
> Yet he his mothers lore did well retaine,  
> And euer from faire Ladies loue did fly;  
> Yet many Ladies faire did oft complaine,  
> That they for loue of him would algates dy:  
> Dy, who so list for him, he was loues enimy.
>
> But ah, who can deceiue his destiny,  
> Or weene by warning to auoyd his fate?  
> That when he sleepes in most security,  
> And safest seemes, him soonest doth amate,  
> And findeth dew effect or soone or late.  
> So feeble is the powre of fleshly arme.  
> His mother bad him womens loue to hate,  
> For she of womans force did feare no harme;  
> So weening to haue arm'd him, she did quite disarme.
>
> This was that woman, this that deadly wound,  
> That *Proteus* prophecide should him dismay,  
> The which his mother vainely did expound,  
> To be hart-wounding loue, which should assay  
> To bring her sonne vnto his last decay.  
> So tickle be the termes of mortall state,  
> And full of subtile sophismes, which do play  
> With double senses, and with false debate,  
> T'approue the vnknowen purpose of eternall fate.
>
> Too true the famous *Marinell* it fownd,  
> Who through late triall, on that wealthy Strond  
> Inglorious now lies in senselesse swownd,  
> Through heauy stroke of *Britomartis* hond.  
> Which when his mother deare did vnderstond,  
> And heauy tydings heard, whereas she playd  
> Amongst her watry sisters by a pond,  
> Gathering sweet daffadillyes, to haue made  
> Gay girlonds, from the Sun their forheads faire to shade.
>
> Eftsoones both flowres and girlonds farre away  
> She flong, and her faire deawy lockes yrent,  
> To sorrow huge she turnd her former play,  
> And gamesom merth to grieuous dreriment:  
> She threw her selfe downe on the Continent,  
> Ne word did speake, but lay as in a swowne,  
> Whiles all her sisters did for her lament,  
> With yelling outcries, and with shrieking sowne;  
> And euery one did teare her girlond from her crowne.
>
> Soone as she vp out of her deadly fit  
> Arose, she bad her charet to be brought,  
> And all her sisters, that with her did sit,  
> Bad eke attonce their charets to be sought;  
> Tho full of bitter griefe and pensiue thought,  
> She to her wagon clombe; clombe all the rest,  
> And forth together went, with sorrow fraught.  
> The waues obedient to their beheast,  
> Them yielded readie passage, and their rage surceast.
>
> Great *Neptune* stood amazed at their sight,  
> Whiles on his broad round backe they softly slid  
> And eke himselfe mournd at their mournfull plight,  
> Yet wist not what their wailing ment, yet did  
> For great compassion of their sorrow, bid  
> His mightie waters to them buxome bee;  
> Eftsoones the roaring billowes still abid,  
> And all the griesly Monsters of the See  
> Stood gaping at their gate, and wondred them to see.
>
> A teme of Dolphins raunged in aray,  
> Drew the smooth charet of sad *Cymoent*;  
> They were all taught by *Triton*, to obay  
> To the long raynes, at her commaundement:  
> As swift as swallowes, on the waues they went,  
> That their broad flaggie finnes no fome did reare,  
> Ne bubbling roundell they behind them sent;  
> The rest of other fishes drawen weare,  
> Which with their finny oars the swelling sea did sheare.
>
> Soone as they bene arriu'd vpon the brim  
> Of the *Rich strond*, their charets they forlore,  
> And let their temed fishes softly swim  
> Along the margent of the fomy shore,  
> Least they their finnes should bruze, and surbate sore  
> Their tender feet vpon the stony ground:  
> And comming to the place, where all in gore  
> And cruddy bloud enwallowed they found  
> The lucklesse *Marinell*, lying in deadly swound;
>
> His mother swowned thrise, and the third time  
> Could scarce recouered be out of her paine;  
> Had she not bene deuoyd of mortall slime,  
> She should not then haue bene reliu'd againe,  
> But soone as life recouered had the raine,  
> She made so piteous mone and deare wayment,  
> That the hard rocks could scarse from teares refraine,  
> And all her sister Nymphes with one consent  
> Supplide her sobbing breaches with sad complement.
>
> Deare image of my selfe (she said) that is,  
> The wretched sonne of wretched mother borne,  
> Is this thine high aduauncement, ô is this  
> Th'immortall name, with which thee yet vnborne  
> Thy Gransire *Nereus* promist to adorne?  
> Now lyest thou of life and honor reft;  
> Now lyest thou a lumpe of earth forlorne,  
> Ne of thy late life memory is left,  
> Ne can thy irreuocable destiny be weft?
>
> Fond *Proteus*, father of false prophecis,  
> And they more fond, that credit to thee giue,  
> Not this the worke of womans hand ywis,  
> That so deepe wound through these deare members driue.  
> I feared loue: but they that loue do liue,  
> But they that die, doe neither loue nor hate.  
> Nath'lesse to thee thy folly I forgiue,  
> And to my selfe, and to accursed fate  
> The guilt I doe ascribe: deare wisedome bought too late.
>
> O what auailes it of immortall seed  
> To beene ybred and neuer borne to die?  
> Farre better I it deeme to die with speed,  
> Then waste in woe and wailefull miserie.  
> Who dyes the vtmost dolour doth abye,  
> But who that liues, is left to waile his losse:  
> So life is losse, and death felicitie.  
> Sad life worse then glad death: and greater crosse  
> To see friends graue, thẽ dead the graue selfe to engrosse.
>
> But if the heauens did his dayes enuie,  
> And my short blisse maligne, yet mote they well  
> Thus much afford me, ere that he did die  
> That the dim eyes of my deare *Marinell*  
> I mote haue closed, and him bed farewell,  
> Sith other offices for mother meet  
> They would not graunt.  
> Yet maulgre them farewell, my sweetest sweet;  
> Farewell my sweetest sonne, sith we no more shall meet.
>
> Thus when they all had sorrowed their fill,  
> They softly gan to search his griesly wound:  
> And that they might him handle more at will,  
> They him disarm'd, and spredding on the ground  
> Their watchet mantles frindgd with siluer round,  
> They softly wipt away the gelly blood  
> From th'orifice; which hauing well vpbound,  
> They pourd in soueraine balme, and Nectar good,  
> Good both for earthly med'cine, and for heauenly food.
>
> Tho when the lilly handed *Liagore*,  
> (This *Liagore* whylome had learned skill  
> In leaches craft, by great *Appolloes* lore,  
> Sith her whylome vpon high *Pindus* hill,  
> He loued, and at last her wombe did fill  
> With heauenly seed, whereof wise *Pæon* sprong)  
> Did feele his pulse, she knew their staied still  
> Some litle life his feeble sprites emong;  
> Which to his mother told, despeire she from her flong.
>
> Tho vp him taking in their tender hands,  
> They easily vnto her charet beare:  
> Her teme at her commaundement quiet stands,  
> Whiles they the corse into her wagon reare,  
> And strow with flowres the lamentable beare:  
> Then all the rest into their coches clim,  
> And through the brackish waues their passage sheare;  
> Vpon great *Neptunes* necke they softly swim,  
> And to her watry chamber swiftly carry him.
>
> Deepe in the bottome of the sea, her bowre  
> Is built of hollow billowes heaped hye,  
> Like to thicke cloudes, that threat a stormy showre,

> For *Tryphon* of sea gods the soueraine leach is hight.
>
> The whiles the *Nymphes* sit all about him round,  
> Lamenting his mishap and heauy plight;  
> And oft his mother vewing his wide wound,  
> Cursed the hand, that did so deadly smight  
> Her dearest sonne, her dearest harts delight.  
> But none of all those curses ouertooke  
> The warlike Maid, th'ensample of that might,  
> But fairely well she thriu'd, and well did brooke  
> Her noble deeds, ne her right course for ought forsooke.

> Yet did false *Archimage* her still pursew,

>
> Through thick and thin, through mountaines & through plains,

>
> But *Timias*, the Princes gentle Squire,

>
> At last of her farre off he gained vew:

>
> But nothing might relent her hastie flight;  
> So deepe the deadly feare of that foule swaine

> Which after her his nimble wings doth straine,

>
> With no lesse haste, and eke with no lesse dreed,

>
> His vncouth shield and straunge armes her dismayd,

> All suddenly dim woxe the dampish ayre,

> His wicked fortune, that had turnd aslope,  
> And cursed night, that reft from him so goodly scope.
>
> Tho when her wayes he could no more descry,

>
> But gentle Sleepe enuyde him any rest;  
> In stead thereof sad sorrow, and disdaine  
> Of his hard hap did vexe his noble brest,  
> And thousand fancies bet his idle braine  
> With their light wings, the sights of semblants vaine:  
> Oft did he wish, that Lady faire mote bee  
> His Faery Queene, for whom he did complaine:  
> Or that his Faery Queene were such, as shee:  
> And euer hastie Night he blamed bitterlie.
>
> Night thou foule Mother of annoyance sad,  
> Sister of heauie death, and nourse of woe,  
> Which wast begot in heauen, but for thy bad  
> And brutish shape thrust downe to hell below,  
> Where by the grim floud of *Cocytus* slow  
> Thy dwelling is, in *Herebus* blacke hous,  
> (Blacke *Herebus* thy husband is the foe  
> Of all the Gods) where thou vngratious,  
> Halfe of thy dayes doest lead in horrour hideous.
>
> What had th'eternall Maker need of thee,  
> The world in his continuall course to keepe,  
> That doest all things deface, ne lettest see  
> The beautie of his worke? Indeed in sleepe  
> The slouthfull bodie, that doth loue to steepe  
> His lustlesse limbes, and drowne his baser mind,  
> Doth praise thee oft, and oft from *Stygian* deepe  
> Calles thee, his goddesse in his error blind,  
> And great Dame Natures handmaide, chearing euery kind.
>
> But well I wote, that to an heauy hart  
> Thou art the root and nurse of bitter cares,  
> Breeder of new, renewer of old smarts:  
> In stead of rest thou lendest rayling teares,  
> In stead of sleepe thou sendest troublous feares,  
> And dreadfull visions, in the which aliue  
> The drearie image of sad death appeares:  
> So from the wearie spirit thou doest driue  
> Desired rest, and men of happinesse depriue.
>
> Vnder thy mantle blacke there hidden lye,  
> Light-shonning theft, and traiterous intent,  
> Abhorred bloudshed, and vile felony,  
> Shamefull deceipt, and daunger imminent;  
> Foule horror, and eke hellish dreriment:  
> All these I wote in thy protection bee,  
> And light doe shonne, for feare of being shent:  
> For light ylike is loth'd of them and thee,  
> And all that lewdnesse loue, doe hate the light to see.
>
> For day discouers all dishonest wayes,  
> And sheweth each thing, as it is indeed:  
> The prayses of high God he faire displayes,  
> And his large bountie rightly doth areed.  
> Dayes dearest children be the blessed seed,  
> Which darknesse shall subdew, and heauen win;  
> Truth is his daughter; he her first did breed,  
> Most sacred virgin, without spot of sin.  
> Our life is day, but death with darknesse doth begin.
>
> O when will day then turne to me againe,  
> And bring with him his long expected light?  
> O *Titan*, haste to reare thy ioyous waine:  
> Speed thee to spred abroad thy beames bright?  
> And chase away this too long lingring night,  
> Chase her away, from whence she came, to hell.  
> She, she it is, that hath me done despight:  
> There let her with the damned spirits dwell,  
> And yeeld her roome to day, that can it gouerne well.
>
> Thus did the Prince that wearie night outweare,  
> In restlesse anguish and vnquiet paine:  
> And earely, ere the morrow did vpreare  
> His deawy head out of the *Ocean* maine,  
> He vp arose, as halfe in great disdaine,  
> And clombe vnto his steed. So forth he went,  
> With heauie looke and lumpish pace, that plaine  
> In him bewraid great grudge and maltalent:  
> His steed eke seem'd t'apply his steps to his intent.
