<blockquote>
<i>Amoret rapt by greedie lust<br>
Belphebe saues from dread:<br>
The Squire her loues, and being blam'd<br>
his dayes in dole doth lead.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
G
Reat God of loue, that with thy cruell darts,<br>
Doest conquer greatest conquerors on ground,<br>
And setst thy kingdome in the captiue harts<br>
Of Kings and Keasars, to thy seruice bound,<br>
What glorie, or what guerdon hast thou found<br>
In feeble Ladies tyranning so sore;<br>
And adding anguish to the bitter wound,<br>
With which their liues thou lanchedst long afore,<br>
By heaping stormes of trouble on them daily more?<p>

So whylome didst thou to faire <i>Florimell</i>;<br>
And so and so to noble <i>Britomart</i>:<br>
So doest thou now to her, of whom I tell,<br>
The louely <i>Amoret</i>, whose gentle hart<br>
Thou martyrest with sorow and with smart,<br>
In saluage forrests, and in deserts wide,<br>
With Beares and Tygers taking heauie part,<br>
Withouten comfort, and withouten guide,<br>
That pittie is to heare the perils, which she tride.<p>

So soone as she with that braue Britonesse<br>
Had left that Turneyment for beauties prise,<br>
They trauel'd long, that now for wearinesse,<br>
Both of the way, and warlike exercise,<br>
Both through a forest ryding did deuise<br>
T'alight, and rest their wearie limbs awhile.<br>
There heauie sleepe the eye-lids did surprise<br>
Of <i>Britomart</i> after long tedious toyle,<br>
That did her passed paines in quiet rest assoyle.<p>

The whiles faire <i>Amoret</i>, of nought affeard,<br>
Walkt through the wood, for pleasure, or for need;<br>
When suddenly behind her backe she heard<br>
One rushing forth out of the thickest weed,<br>
That ere she backe could turne to taken heed,<br>
Had vnawares her snatched vp from ground.<br>
Feebly she shriekt, but so feebly indeed,<br>
That <i>Britomart</i> heard not the shrilling sound,<br>
There where through weary trauel she lay sleeping sou&tilde;d.<p>

It was to weet a wilde and saluage man,<br>
Yet was no man, but onely like in shape,<br>
And eke in stature higher by a span,<br>
All ouergrowne with haire, that could awhape<br>
An hardy hart, and his wide mouth did gape<br>
With huge great teeth, like to a tusked Bore:<br>
For he liu'd all on rauin and on rape<br>
Of men and beasts; and fed on fleshly gore,<br>
The signe whereof yet stain'd his bloudy lips afore.<p>

His neather lip was not like man nor beast,<br>
But like a wide deepe poke, downe hanging low,<br>
In which he wont the relickes of his feast,<br>
And cruell spoyle, which he had spard, to stow:<br>
And ouer it his huge great nose did grow,<br>
Full dreadfully empurpled all with bloud;<br>
And downe both sides two wide long eares did glow,<br>
And raught downe to his waste, when vp he stood,<br>
More great then th'eares of Elephants by <i>Indus</i> flood.<p>

His wast was with a wreath of yuie greene<br>
Engirt about, ne other garment wore:<br>
For all his haire was like a garment seene;<br>
And in his hand a tall young oake he bore,<br>
Whose knottie snags were sharpned all afore,<br>
And beath'd in fire for steele to be in sted.<br>
But whence he was, or of what wombe ybore,<br>
Of beasts, or of the earth, I haue not red:<br>
But certes was with milke of Wolues and Tygres fed.<p>

This vgly creature in his armes her snatcht,<br>
And through the forrest bore her quite away,<br>
With briers and bushes all to rent and scratcht;<br>
Ne care he had, ne pittie of the pray,<br>
Which many a knight had sought so many a day.<br>
He stayed not, but in his armes her bearing<br>
Ran, till he came to th'end of all his way,<br>
Vnto his caue farre from all peoples hearing,<br>
And there he threw her in, nought feeling, ne nought fearing.<p>

For she deare Ladie all the way was dead,<br>
Whilest he in armes her bore; but when she felt<br>
Her selfe downe soust, she waked out of dread<br>
Streight into griefe, that her deare hart nigh swelt,<br>
And eft gan into tender teares to melt.<br>
Then when she lookt about, and nothing found<br>
But darknesse and dread horrour, where she dwelt,<br>
She almost fell againe into a swound,<br>
Ne wist whether aboue she were, or vnder ground.<p>

With that she heard some one close by her side<br>
Sighing and sobbing sore, as if the paine<br>
Her tender hart in peeces would diuide:<br>
Which she long listning, softly askt againe<br>
What mister wight it was that so did plaine?<br>
To whom thus aunswer'd was: Ah wretched wight<br>
That seekes to know anothers griefe in vaine,<br>
Vnweeting of thine owne like haplesse plight:<br>
Selfe to forget to mind another, is ouersight.<p>

Aye me (said she) where am I, or with whom?<br>
Emong the liuing, or emong the dead?<br>
What shall of me vnhappy maid become?<br>
Shall death be th'end, or ought else worse, aread.<br>
Vnhappy mayd (then answerd she) whose dread<br>
Vntride, is lesse then when thou shalt it try:<br>
Death is to him, that wretched life doth lead,<br>
Both grace and gaine; but he in hell doth lie,<br>
That liues a loathed life, and wishing cannot die.<p>

This dismall day hath thee a caytiue made,<br>
And vassall to the vilest wretch aliue,<br>
Whose cursed vsage and vngodly trade<br>
The heauens abhorre, and into darkenesse driue.<br>
For on the spoile of women he doth liue,<br>
Whose bodies chast, when euer in his powre<br>
He may them catch, vnable to gainestriue,<br>
He with his shamefull lust doth first deflowre,<br>
And afterwards themselues doth cruelly deuoure.<p>

Now twenty daies, by which the sonnes of men<br>
Diuide their works, haue past through heuen sheene,<br>
Since I was brought into this dolefull den;<br>
During which space these sory eies haue seen<br>
Seauen women by him slaine, and eaten clene.<br>
And now no more for him but I alone,<br>
And this old woman here remaining beene;<br>
Till thou cam'st hither to augment our mone,<br>
And of vs three to morrow he will sure eate one.<p>

Ah dreadfull tidings which thou doest declare,<br>
(Quoth she) of all that euer hath bene knowen:<br>
Full many great calamities and rare<br>
This feeble brest endured hath, but none<br>
Equall to this, where euer I haue gone.<br>
But what are you, whom like vnlucky lot<br>
Hath linckt with me in the same chaine attone?<br>
To tell (quoth she) that which ye see, needs not;<br>
A wofull wretched maid, of God and man forgot.<p>

But what I was, it irkes me to reherse<br>
Daughter vnto a Lord of high degree;<br>
That ioyd in happy peace, till fates peruerse<br>
With guilefull loue did secretly agree,<br>
To ouerthrow my state and dignitie.<br>
It was my lot to loue a gentle swaine,<br>
Yet was he but a Squire of low degree;<br>
Yet was he meet, vnlesse mine eye did faine,<br>
By any Ladies side for Leman to haue laine.<p>

But for his meannesse and disparagement,<br>
My Sire, who me too dearely well did loue,<br>
Vnto my choise by no meanes would assent,<br>
But often did my folly fowle reproue.<br>
Yet nothing could my fixed mind remoue,<br>
But whether willed or nilled friend or foe,<br>
I me resolu'd the vtmost end to proue,<br>
And rather then my loue abandon so,<br>
Both sire, and friends, and all for euer to forego.<p>

Thenceforth I sought by secret meanes to worke<br>
Time to my will, and from his wrathfull sight<br>
To hide th'intent, which in my heart did lurke,<br>
Till I thereto had all things ready dight.<br>
So on a day vnweeting vnto wight,<br>
I with that Squire agreede away to flit,<br>
And in a priuy place, betwixt vs hight,<br>
Within a groue appointed him to meete;<br>
To which I boldly came vpon my feeble feete.<p>

But ah vnhappy houre me thither brought:<br>
For in that place where I him thought to find,<br>
There was I found, contrary to my thought,<br>
Of this accursed Carle of hellish kind;<br>
The shame of men, and plague of womankind,<br>
Who trussing me, as Eagle doth his pray,<br>
Me hether brought with him, as swift as wind,<br>
Where yet vntouched till this present day,<br>
I rest his wretched thrall, the sad <i>AEmylia</i>.<p>

Ah sad <i>AEmylia</i> (then sayd <i>Amoret</i>,)<br>
Thy ruefull plight I pitty as mine owne.<br>
But read to me, by what deuise or wit,<br>
Hast thou in all this time, from him vnknowne<br>
Thine honor sau'd, though into thraldome throwne?<br>
Through helpe (quoth she) of this old woman here<br>
I haue so done, as she to me hath showne.<br>
For euer when he burnt in lustfull fire,<br>
She in my stead supplide his bestiall desire.<p>

Thus of their euils as they did discourse,<br>
And each did other much bewaile and mone;<br>
Loe where the villaine selfe, their sorrowes sourse,<br>
Came to the caue, and rolling thence the stone,<br>
Which wont to stop the mouth thereof, that none<br>
Might issue forth, came rudely rushing in,<br>
And spredding ouer all the flore alone,<br>
Gan dight him selfe vnto his wonted sinne;<br>
Which ended, then his bloudy banket should beginne.<p>

Which when as fearefull <i>Amoret</i> perceiued,<br>
She staid not the vtmost end thereof to try,<br>
But like a ghastly Gelt, whose wits are reaued,<br>
Ran forth in hast with hideous outcry,<br>
For horrour of his shamefull villany.<br>
But after her full lightly he vprose,<br>
And her pursu'd as fast as she did flie:<br>
Full fast she flies, and farre afore him goes,<br>
Ne feeles the thorns and thickets pricke her tender toes.<p>

Nor hedge, nor ditch, nor hill, nor dale she staies,<br>
But ouerleapes them all, like Robucke light,<br>
And through the thickest makes her nighest waies;<br>
And euermore when with regardfull sight<br>
She looking backe, espies that griesly wight<br>
Approching nigh, she gins to mend her pace,<br>
And makes her feare a spur to hast her flight:<br>
More swift then <i>Myrrh'</i> or <i>Daphne</i> in her race,<br>
Or any of the Thracian Nimphes in saluage chase.<p>

Long so she fled, and so he follow'd long;<br>
Ne liuing aide for her on earth appeares,<br>
But if the heauens helpe to redresse her wrong,<br>
Moued with pity of her plenteous teares.<br>
It fortuned <i>Belphebe</i> with her peares<br>
The woody Nimphs, and with that louely boy,<br>
Was hunting then the Libbards and the Beares,<br>
In these wild woods, as was her wonted ioy,<br>
To banish sloth, that oft doth noble mindes annoy.<p>

It so befell, as oft it fals in chace,<br>
That each of them from other sundred were,<br>
And that same gentle Squire arriu'd in place,<br>
Where this same cursed caytiue did appeare,<br>
Pursuing that faire Lady full of feare;<br>
And now he her quite ouertaken had;<br>
And now he her away with him did beare<br>
Vnder his arme, as seeming wondrous glad,<br>
That by his grenning laughter mote farre off be rad.<p>

Which drery sight the gentle Squire espying,<br>
Doth hast to crosse him by the nearest way,<br>
Led with that wofull Ladies piteous crying,<br>
And him assailes with all the might he may:<br>
Yet will not he the louely spoile downe lay,<br>
But with his craggy club in his right hand,<br>
Defends him selfe, and saues his gotten pray.<br>
Yet had it bene right hard him to withstand,<br>
But that he was full light and nimble on the land.<p>

Thereto the villaine vsed craft in fight;<br>
For euer when the Squire his iauelin shooke,<br>
He held the Lady forth before him right,<br>
And with her body, as a buckler, broke<br>
The puissance of his intended stroke.<br>
And if it chaunst, (as needs it must in fight)<br>
Whilest he on him was greedy to be wroke,<br>
That any little blow on her did light,<br>
Then would he laugh aloud, and gather great delight.<p>

Which subtill sleight did him encumber much,<br>
And made him oft, when he would strike, forbeare;<br>
For hardly could he come the carle to touch,<br>
But that he her must hurt, or hazard neare:<br>
Yet he his hand so carefully did beare,<br>
That at the last he did himselfe attaine,<br>
And therein left the pike head of his speare.<br>
A streame of coleblacke bloud thence gusht amaine,<br>
That all her silken garments did with bloud bestaine.<p>

With that he threw her rudely on the flore,<br>
And laying both his hands vpon his glaue,<br>
With dreadfull strokes let driue at him so sore,<br>
That forst him flie abacke, himselfe to saue:<br>
Yet he therewith so felly still did raue,<br>
That scarse the Squire his hand could once vpreare,<br>
But for aduantage ground vnto him gaue,<br>
Tracing and trauersing, now here, now there;<br>
For bootlesse thing it was to think such blowes to beare.<p>

Whilest thus in battell they embusied were,<br>
<i>Belphebe</i> raunging in that forrest wide,<br>
The hideous noise of their huge strokes did heare,<br>
And drew thereto, making her eare her guide.<br>
Whom when that theefe approching nigh espide,<br>
With bow in hand, and arrowes ready bent,<br>
He by his former combate would not bide,<br>
But fled away with ghastly dreriment,<br>
Well knowing her to be his deaths sole instrument.<p>

Whom seeing flie, she speedily poursewed<br>
With winged feete, as nimble as the winde;<br>
And euer in her bow she ready shewed<br>
The arrow, to his deadly marke desynde,<br>
As when <i>Latonaes</i> daughter cruell kynde,<br>
In vengement of her mothers great disgrace,<br>
With fell despight her cruell arrowes tynde<br>
Gainst wofull <i>Niobes</i> vnhappy race,<br>
That all the gods did mone her miserable case.<p>

So well she sped her and so far she ventred,<br>
That ere vnto his hellish den he raught,<br>
Euen as he ready was there to haue entred,<br>
She sent an arrow forth with mighty draught,<br>
That in the very dore him ouercaught,<br>
And in his nape arriuing, through it thrild<br>
His greedy throte, therewith in two distraught,<br>
That all his vitall spirites thereby spild,<br>
And all his hairy brest with gory bloud was fild.<p>

Whom when on ground she groueling saw to rowle,<br>
She ran in hast his life to haue bereft:<br>
But ere she could him reach, the sinfull sowle<br>
Hauing his carrion corse quite sencelesse left,<br>
Was fled to hell, surcharg'd with spoile and theft.<br>
Yet ouer him she there long gazing stood,<br>
And oft admir'd his monstrous shape, and oft<br>
His mighty limbs, whilest all with filthy bloud<br>
The place there ouerflowne, seemd like a sodaine flood.<p>

Thence forth she past into his dreadfull den,<br>
Where nought but darkesome drerinesse she found,<br>
Ne creature saw, but hearkned now and then<br>
Some litle whispering, and soft groning sound.<br>
With that she askt, what ghosts there vnder ground<br>
Lay hid in horrour of eternall night?<br>
And bad them, if so be they were not bound,<br>
To come and shew themselues before the light,<br>
Now freed from feare and danger of that dismall wight.<p>

Then forth the sad <i>AEmylia</i> issewed,<br>
Yet trembling euery ioynt through former feare;<br>
And after her the Hag, there with her mewed,<br>
A foule and lothsome creature did appeare;<br>
A leman fit for such a louer deare.<br>
That mou'd <i>Belphebe</i> her no lesse to hate,<br>
Then for to rue the others heauy cheare;<br>
Of whom she gan enquire of her estate.<br>
Who all to her at large, as hapned, did relate.<p>

Thence she them brought toward the place, where late<br>
She left the gentle Squire with <i>Amoret:</i><br>
There she him found by that new louely mate,<br>
Who lay the whiles in swoune, full sadly set,<br>
From her faire eyes wiping the deawy wet,<br>
Which softly stild, and kissing them atweene,<br>
And handling soft the hurts, which she did get.<br>
For of that Carle she sorely bruz'd had beene,<br>
Als of his owne rash hand one wound was to be seene.<p>

Which when she saw, with sodaine glauncing eye,<br>
Her noble heart with sight thereof was fild<br>
With deepe disdaine, and great indignity,<br>
That in her wrath she thought them both haue thrild,<br>
With that selfe arrow, which the Carle had kild:<br>
Yet held her wrathfull hand from vengeance sore,<br>
But drawing nigh, ere he her well beheld;<br>
Is this the faith, she said, and said no more,<br>
But turnd her face, and fled away for euermore.<p>

He seeing her depart, arose vp light,<br>
Right sore agrieued at her sharpe reproofe,<br>
And follow'd fast: but when he came in sight,<br>
He durst not nigh approch, but kept aloofe,<br>
For dread of her displeasures vtmost proofe.<br>
And euermore, when he did grace entreat,<br>
And framed speaches fit for his behoofe,<br>
Her mortall arrowes she at him did threat,<br>
And forst him backe with fowle dishonor to retreat.<p>

At last when long he follow'd had in vaine,<br>
Yet found no ease of griefe, nor hope of grace,<br>
Vnto those woods he turned backe againe,<br>
Full of sad anguish, and in heauy case:<br>
And finding there fit solitary place<br>
For wofull wight, chose out a gloomy glade,<br>
Where hardly eye mote see bright heauens face,<br>
For mossy trees, which couered all with shade<br>
And sad melancholy: there he his cabin made.<p>

His wonted warlike weapons all he broke,<br>
And threw away, with vow to vse no more,<br>
Ne thenceforth euer strike in battell stroke,<br>
Ne euer word to speake to woman more;<br>
But in that wildernesse, of men forlore,<br>
And of the wicked world forgotten quight,<br>
His hard mishap in dolor to deplore,<br>
And wast his wretched daies in wofull plight;<br>
So on him selfe to wreake his follies owne despight.<p>

And eke his garment, to be thereto meet,<br>
He wilfully did cut and shape anew;<br>
And his faire lockes, that wont with ointment sweet<br>
To be embaulm'd, and sweat out dainty dew,<br>
He let to grow and griesly to concrew,<br>
Vncomb'd, vncurl'd, and carelesly vnshed;<br>
That in short time his face they ouergrew,<br>
And ouer all his shoulders did dispred,<br>
That who he whilome was, vneath was to be red.<p>

There he continued in this carefull plight,<br>
Wretchedly wearing out his youthly yeares,<br>
Through wilfull penury consumed quight,<br>
That like a pined ghost he soone appeares.<br>
For other food then that wilde forrest beares,<br>
Ne other drinke there did he euer tast,<br>
Then running water, tempred with his teares,<br>
The more his weakened body so to wast:<br>
That out of all mens knowledge he was worne at last.<p>

For on a day, by fortune as it fell,<br>
His owne deare Lord Prince <i>Arthure</i> came that way,<br>
Seeking aduentures, where he mote heare tell;<br>
And as he through the wandring wood did stray,<br>
Hauing espide this Cabin far away,<br>
He to it drew, to weet who there did wonne;<br>
Weening therein some holy Hermit lay,<br>
That did resort of sinfull people shonne;<br>
Or else some woodman shrowded there from scorching sunne.<p>

Arriuing there, he found this wretched man,<br>
Spending his daies in dolour and despaire,<br>
And through long fasting woxen pale and wan,<br>
All ouergrowen with rude and rugged haire;<br>
That albeit his owne deare Squire he were,<br>
Yet he him knew not, ne auiz'd at all,<br>
But like strange wight, whom he had seene no where,<br>
Saluting him, gan into speach to fall,<br>
And pitty much his plight, that liu'd like outcast thrall.<p>

But to his speach he aunswered no whit,<br>
But stood still mute, as if he had beene dum,<br>
Ne signe of sence did shew, ne common wit,<br>
As one with griefe and anguishe ouercum,<br>
And vnto euery thing did aunswere mum:<br>
And euer when the Prince vnto him spake,<br>
He louted lowly, as did him becum,<br>
And humble homage did vnto him make,<br>
Midst sorrow shewing ioyous semblance for his sake.<p>

At which his vncouth guise and vsage quaint<br>
The Prince did wonder much, yet could not ghesse<br>
The cause of that his sorrowfull constraint;<br>
Yet weend by secret signes of manlinesse,<br>
Which close appeard in that rude brutishnesse,<br>
That he whilome some gentle swaine had beene,<br>
Traind vp in feats of armes and knightlinesse;<br>
Which he obseru'd, by that he him had seene<br>
To weld his naked sword, and try the edges keene.<p>

And eke by that he saw on euery tree,<br>
How he the name of one engrauen had,<br>
Which likly was his liefest loue to be,<br>
For whom he now so sorely was bestad;<br>
Which was by him <i>BELPHEBE</i> rightly rad.<br>
Yet who was that <i>Belphebe</i>, he ne wist;<br>
Yet saw he often how he wexed glad,<br>
When he it heard, and how the ground he kist,<br>
Wherein it written was, and how himselfe he blist:<p>

Tho when he long had marked his demeanor,<br>
And saw that all he said and did, was vaine,<br>
Ne ought mote make him change his wonted tenor,<br>
Ne ought mote ease or mitigate his paine,<br>
He left him there in languor to remaine,<br>
Till time for him should remedy prouide,<br>
And him restore to former grace againe.<br>
Which for it is too long here to abide,<br>
I will deferre the end vntill another tide.<p>
