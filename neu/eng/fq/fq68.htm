<blockquote>
<i>Calidore brings Priscilla home,<br>
Pursues the Blatant Beast:<br>
Saues Serena, whilest Calepine<br>
By Turpine is opprest.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
T
rue is, that whilome that good Poet sayd,<br>
The gentle minde by gentle deeds is knowne.<br>
For a man by nothing is so well bewrayd,<br>
As by his manners, in which plaine is showne<br>
Of what degree and what race he is growne.<br>
For seldome seene, a trotting Stalion get<br>
An ambling Colt, that is his proper owne:<br>
So seldome seene, that one in basenesse set<br>
Doth noble courage shew, with curteous manners met.<p>

But euermore contrary hath bene tryde,<br>
That gentle bloud will gentle manners breed;<br>
As well may be in <i>Calidore</i> descryde,<br>
By late ensample of that courteous deed,<br>
Done to that wounded Knight in his great need,<br>
Whom on his backe he bore, till he him brought<br>
Vnto the Castle where they had decreed.<br>
There of the Knight, the which that Castle ought,<br>
To make abode that night he greatly was besought.<p>

He was to weete a man of full ripe yeares,<br>
That in his youth had beene of mickle might,<br>
And borne great sway in armes amongst his peares:<br>
But now weake age had dimd his candle light.<br>
Yet was he courteous still to euery wight,<br>
And loued all that did to armes incline.<br>
And was the father of that wounded Knight,<br>
Whom <i>Calidore</i> thus carried on his chine,<br>
And <i>Aldus</i> was his name, and his sonnes <i>Aladine</i>.<p>

Who when he saw his sonne so ill bedight,<br>
With bleeding wounds, brought home vpon a Beare<br>
By a faire Lady, and a straunger Knight,<br>
Was inly touched with compassion deare,<br>
And deare affection of so dolefull dreare,<br>
That he these words burst forth; Ah sory boy,<br>
Is this the hope that to my hoary heare<br>
Thou brings? aie me, is this the timely ioy,<br>
Which I expected long, now turnd to sad annoy?<p>

Such is the weakenesse of all mortall hope;<br>
So tickle is the state of earthly things,<br>
That ere they come vnto their aymed scope,<br>
They fall too short of our fraile reckonings,<br>
And bring vs bale and bitter sorrowings,<br>
In stead of comfort, which we should embrace:<br>
This is the state of Keasars and of Kings.<br>
Let none therefore, that is in meaner place,<br>
Too greatly grieue at any his vnlucky case.<p>

So well and wisely did that good old Knight<br>
Temper his griefe, and turned it to cheare,<br>
To cheare his guests, whom he had stayd that night,<br>
And make their welcome to them well appeare:<br>
That to Sir <i>Calidore</i> was easie geare;<br>
But that faire Lady would be cheard for nought,<br>
But sigh't and sorrow'd for her louer deare,<br>
And inly did afflict her pensiue thought,<br>
With thinking to what case her name should now be brought.<p>

For she was daughter to a noble Lord,<br>
Which dwelt thereby, who sought her to affy<br>
To a great pere; but she did disaccord,<br>
Ne could her liking to his loue apply,<br>
But lou'd this fresh young Knight, who dwelt her ny,<br>
The lusty <i>Aladine</i>, though meaner borne,<br>
And of lesse liuelood and hability,<br>
Yet full of valour, the which did adorne<br>
His meanesse much, &amp; make her th'others riches scorne.<p>

So hauing both found fit occasion,<br>
They met together in that luckelesse glade;<br>
Where that proud Knight in his presumption<br>
The gentle <i>Aladine</i> did earst inuade,<br>
Being vnarm'd, and set in secret shade.<br>
Whereof she now bethinking, gan t'aduize,<br>
How great a hazard she at earst had made<br>
Of her good fame, and further gan deuize,<br>
How she the blame might salue with coloured disguize.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> with all good courtesie<br>
Fain'd her to frolicke, and to put away<br>
The pensiue fit of her melancholie;<br>
And that old Knight by all meanes did assay,<br>
To make them both as merry as he may.<br>
So they the euening past, till time of rest,<br>
When <i>Calidore</i> in seemly good array<br>
Vnto his bowre was brought, and there vndrest,<br>
Did sleepe all night through weary trauell of his quest.<p>

But faire <i>Priscilla</i> (so that Lady hight)<br>
Would to no bed, nor take no kindely sleepe,<br>
But by her wounded loue did watch all night,<br>
And all the night for bitter anguish weepe,<br>
And with her teares his wounds did wash and steepe.<br>
So well she washt them, and so well she watcht him,<br>
That of the deadly swound, in which full deepe<br>
He drenched was, she at the length dispacht him,<br>
And droue away the stound, which mortally attacht him.<p>

The morrow next, when day gan to vplooke,<br>
He also gan vplooke with drery eye,<br>
Like one that out of deadly dreame awooke:<br>
Where when he saw his faire <i>Priscilla</i> by,<br>
He deepely sigh't, and groaned inwardly,<br>
To thinke of this ill state, in which she stood,<br>
To which she for his sake had weetingly<br>
Now brought her selfe, and blam'd her noble blood:<br>
For first, next after life, he tendered her good.<p>

Which she perceiuing, did with plenteous teares<br>
His care more then her owne compassionate,<br>
Forgetfull of her owne, to minde his feares:<br>
So both conspiring, gan to intimate<br>
Each others griefe with zeale affectionate,<br>
And twixt them twaine with equall care to cast,<br>
How to saue hole her hazarded estate;<br>
For which the onely helpe now left them last<br>
Seem'd to be <i>Calidore</i>: all other helpes were past.<p>

Him they did deeme, as sure to them he seemed,<br>
A courteous Knight, and full of faithfull trust:<br>
Therefore to him their cause they best esteemed<br>
Whole to commit, and to his dealing iust.<br>
Earely, so soone as <i>Titans</i> beames forth brust<br>
Through the thicke clouds, in which they steeped lay<br>
All night in darkenesse, duld with yron rust,<br>
<i>Calidore</i> rising vp as fresh as day,<br>
Gan freshly him addresse vnto his former way.<p>

But first him seemed fit, that wounded Knight<br>
To visite, after this nights perillous passe,<br>
And to salute him, if he were in plight,<br>
And eke that Lady his faire louely lasse.<br>
There he him found much better then he was,<br>
And moued speach to him of things of course,<br>
The anguish of his paine to ouerpasse:<br>
Mongst which he namely did to him discourse,<br>
Of former daies mishap, his sorrowes wicked sourse.<p>

Of which occasion <i>Aldine</i> taking hold,<br>
Gan breake to him the fortunes of his loue,<br>
And all his disaduentures to vnfold;<br>
That <i>Calidore</i> it dearly deepe did moue.<br>
In th'end his kyndly courtesie to proue,<br>
He him by all the bands of loue besought,<br>
And as it mote a faithfull friend behoue,<br>
To safeconduct his loue, and not for ought<br>
To leaue, till to her fathers house he had her brought.<p>

Sir <i>Calidore</i> his faith thereto did plight,<br>
It to performe: so after little stay,<br>
That she her selfe had to the iourney dight,<br>
He passed forth with her in faire array,<br>
Fearelesse, who ought did thinke, or ought did say,<br>
Sith his own thought he knew most cleare from wite.<br>
So as they past together on their way,<br>
He can deuize this counter-cast of slight,<br>
To giue faire colour to that Ladies cause in sight.<p>

Streight to the carkasse of that Knight he went,<br>
The cause of all this euill, who was slaine<br>
The day before by iust auengement<br>
Of noble <i>Tristram</i>, where it did remaine:<br>
There he the necke thereof did cut in twaine,<br>
And tooke with him the head, the signe of shame.<br>
So forth he passed thorough that daies paine,<br>
Till to that Ladies fathers house he came;<br>
Most pensiue man, through feare, what of his childe became.<p>

There he arriuing boldly, did present<br>
The fearefull Lady to her father deare,<br>
Most perfect pure, and guiltlesse innocent<br>
Of blame, as he did on his Knighthood sweare,<br>
Since first he saw her, and did free from feare<br>
Of a discourteous Knight, who her had reft,<br>
And by outragious force away did beare:<br>
Witnesse thereof he shew'd his head there left,<br>
And wretched life forlorne for vengement of his theft.<p>

Most ioyfull man her sire was her to see,<br>
And heare th'aduenture of her late mischaunce;<br>
And thousand thankes to <i>Calidore</i> for fee<br>
Of his large paines in her deliueraunce<br>
Did yeeld; Ne lesse the Lady did aduaunce.<br>
Thus hauing her restored trustily,<br>
As he had vow'd, some small continuaunce<br>
He there did make, and then most carefully<br>
Vnto his first exploite he did him selfe apply.<p>

So as he was pursuing of his quest<br>
He chaunst to come whereas a iolly Knight,<br>
In couert shade him selfe did safely rest,<br>
To solace with his Lady in delight:<br>
His warlike armes he had from him vndight:<br>
For that him selfe he thought from daunger free,<br>
And far from enuious eyes that mote him spight.<br>
And eke the Lady was full faire to see,<br>
And courteous withall, becomming her degree.<p>

To whom Sir <i>Calidore</i> approaching nye,<br>
Ere they were well aware of liuing wight,<br>
Them much abasht, but more him selfe thereby,<br>
That he so rudely did vppon them light,<br>
And troubled had their quiet loues delight.<br>
Yet since it was his fortune, not his fault,<br>
Him selfe thereof he labour'd to acquite,<br>
And pardon crau'd for his so rash assault,<br>
That he gainst courtesie so fowly did default.<p>

With which his gentle words and goodly wit<br>
He soone allayd that Knights conceiu'd displeasure,<br>
That he besought him downe by him to sit,<br>
That they mote treat of things abrode at leasure;<br>
And of aduentures, which had in his measure<br>
Of so long waies to him befallen late.<br>
So downe he sate, and with delightfull pleasure<br>
His long aduentures gan to him relate,<br>
Which he endured had through daungerous debate.<p>

Of which whilest they discoursed both together,<br>
The faire <i>Serena</i> (so his Lady hight)<br>
Allur'd with myldnesse of the gentle wether,<br>
And pleasaunce of the place, the which was dight<br>
With diuers flowres distinct with rare delight,<br>
Wandred about the fields, as liking led<br>
Her wauering lust after her wandring sight,<br>
To make a garland to adorne her hed,<br>
Without suspect of ill or daungers hidden dred.<p>

All sodainely out of the forrest nere<br>
The Blatant Beast forth rushing vnaware,<br>
Caught her thus loosely wandring here and there,<br>
And in his wide great mouth away her bare,<br>
Crying aloud to shew her sad misfare<br>
Vnto the Knights, and calling oft for ayde;<br>
Who with the horrour of her haplesse care<br>
Hastily starting vp, like men dismayde,<br>
Ran after fast, to reskue the distressed mayde.<p>

The Beast with their pursuit incited more,<br>
Into the wood was bearing her apace<br>
For to haue spoyled her, when <i>Calidore</i><br>
Who was more light of foote and swift in chace,<br>
Him ouertooke in middest of his race:<br>
And fiercely charging him with all his might,<br>
Forst to forgoe his pray there in the place,<br>
And to betake him selfe to fearefull flight;<br>
For he durst not abide with <i>Calidore</i> to fight.<p>

Who nathelesse, when he the Lady saw<br>
There left on ground, though in full euill plight,<br>
Yet knowing that her Knight now neare did draw,<br>
Staide not to succour her in that affright,<br>
But follow'd fast the Monster in his flight:<br>
Through woods and hils he follow'd him so fast,<br>
That he nould let him breath nor gather spright,<br>
But forst him gape and gaspe, with dread aghast,<br>
As if his lungs and lites were nigh a sunder brast.<p>

And now by this Sir <i>Calepine</i>, so hight,<br>
Came to the place, where he his Lady found<br>
In dolorous dismay and deadly plight,<br>
All in gore bloud there tumbled on the ground,<br>
Hauing both sides through grypt with griesly wound.<br>
His weapons soone from him he threw away,<br>
And stouping downe to her in drery swound,<br>
Vprear'd her from the ground whereon she lay,<br>
And in his tender armes her forced vp to stay.<p>

So well he did his busie paines apply,<br>
That the faint sprite he did reuoke againe,<br>
To her fraile mansion of mortality.<br>
Then vp he tooke her twixt his armes twaine,<br>
And setting on his steede, her did sustaine<br>
With carefull hands soft footing her beside,<br>
Till to some place of rest they mote attaine,<br>
Where she in safe assuraunce mote abide,<br>
Till she recured were of those her woundes wide.<p>

Now when as <i>Phoebus</i> with his fiery waine<br>
Vnto his Inne began to draw apace;<br>
Tho wexing weary of that toylesome paine,<br>
In trauelling on foote so long a space,<br>
Not wont on foote with heauy armes to trace,<br>
Downe in a dale forby a riuers syde,<br>
He chaunst to spie a faire and stately place,<br>
To which he meant his weary steps to guyde,<br>
In hope there for his loue some succour to prouyde.<p>

But comming to the riuers side, he found<br>
That hardly passable on foote it was:<br>
Therefore there still he stood as in a stound,<br>
Ne wist which way he through the foord mote pas.<br>
Thus whilest he was in this distressed case,<br>
Deuising what to doe, he nigh espyde<br>
An armed Knight approaching to the place,<br>
With a faire Lady lincked by his syde,<br>
The which themselues prepard thorough the foord to ride.<p>

Whom <i>Calepine</i> saluting (as became)<br>
Besought of courtesie in that his neede,<br>
For safe conducting of his sickely Dame,<br>
Through that same perillous foord with better heede,<br>
To take him vp behinde vpon his steed:<br>
To whom that other did this taunt returne.<br>
Perdy thou peasant Knight, mightst rightly reed<br>
Me then to be full base and euill borne,<br>
If I would beare behinde a burden of such scorne.<p>

But as thou hast thy steed forlorne with shame,<br>
So fare on foote till thou another gayne,<br>
And let thy Lady likewise doe the same.<br>
Or beare her on thy backe with pleasing payne,<br>
And proue thy manhood on the billowes vayne.<br>
With which rude speach his Lady much displeased,<br>
Did him reproue, yet could him not restrayne,<br>
And would on her owne Palfrey him haue eased,<br>
For pitty of his Dame, whom she saw so diseased.<p>

Sir <i>Calepine</i> her thanckt, yet inly wroth<br>
Against her Knight, her gentlenesse refused,<br>
And carelesly into the riuer goth,<br>
As in despight to be so fowle abused<br>
Of a rude churle, whom often he accused<br>
Of fowle discourtesie, vnfit for Knight;<br>
And strongly wading through the waues vnused,<br>
With speare in th'one hand, stayd him selfe vpright,<br>
With th'other staide his Lady vp with steddy might.<p>

And all the while, that same discourteous Knight,<br>
Stood on the further bancke beholding him,<br>
At whose calamity, for more despight<br>
He laught, and mockt to see him like to swim.<br>
But when as <i>Calepine</i> came to the brim,<br>
And saw his carriage past that perill well,<br>
Looking at that same Carle with count'nance grim,<br>
His heart with vengeaunce inwardly did swell,<br>
And forth at last did breake in speaches sharpe and fell.<p>

Vnknightly Knight, the blemish of that name,<br>
And blot of all that armes vppon them take,<br>
Which is the badge of honour and of fame,<br>
Loe I defie thee, and here challenge make,<br>
That thou for euer doe those armes forsake,<br>
And be for euer held a recreant Knight,<br>
Vnlesse thou dare for thy deare Ladies sake,<br>
And for thine owne defence on foote alight,<br>
To iustifie thy fault gainst me in equall fight.<p>

The dastard, that did heare him selfe defyde,<br>
Seem'd not to weigh his threatfull words at all,<br>
But laught them out, as if his greater pryde<br>
Did scorne the challenge of so base a thrall:<br>
Or had no courage, or else had no gall.<br>
So much the more was <i>Calepine</i> offended,<br>
That him to no reuenge he forth could call,<br>
But both his challenge and him selfe contemned,<br>
Ne cared as a coward so to be condemned.<p>

But he nought weighing what he sayd or did,<br>
Turned his steede about another way,<br>
And with his Lady to the Castle rid,<br>
Where was his won; ne did the other stay,<br>
But after went directly as he may,<br>
For his sicke charge some harbour there to seeke;<br>
Where he arriuing with the fall of day,<br>
Drew to the gate, and there with prayers meeke,<br>
And myld entreaty lodging did for her beseeke.<p>

But the rude Porter that no manners had,<br>
Did shut the gate against him in his face,<br>
And entraunce boldly vnto him forbad.<br>
Nathelesse the Knight now in so needy case,<br>
Gan him entreat euen with submission base,<br>
And humbly praid to let them in that night:<br>
Who to him aunswer'd, that there was no place<br>
Of lodging fit for any errant Knight,<br>
Vnlesse that with his Lord he formerly did fight.<p>

Full loth am I (quoth he) as now at earst,<br>
When day is spent, and rest vs needeth most,<br>
And that this Lady, both whose sides are pearst<br>
With wounds, is ready to forgo the ghost:<br>
Ne would I gladly combate with mine host,<br>
That should to me such curtesie afford,<br>
Vnlesse that I were thereunto enforst.<br>
But yet aread to me, how hight thy Lord,<br>
That doth thus strongly ward the Castle of the ford.<p>

His name (quoth he) if that thou list to learne,<br>
Is hight Sir <i>Turpine</i>, one of mickle might,<br>
And manhood rare, but terrible and stearne<br>
In all assaies to euery errant Knight,<br>
Because of one, that wrought him fowle despight.<br>
Ill seemes (sayd he) if he so valiaunt be,<br>
That he should be so sterne to stranger wight:<br>
For seldome yet did liuing creature see,<br>
That curtesie and manhood euer disagree.<p>

But go thy waies to him, and fro me say,<br>
That here is at his gate an errant Knight,<br>
That house-rome craues, yet would be loth t'assay<br>
The proofe of battell, now in doubtfull night,<br>
Or curtesie with rudenesse to requite:<br>
Yet if he needes will fight, craue leaue till morne,<br>
And tell withall, the lamentable plight,<br>
In which this Lady languisheth forlorne,<br>
That pitty craues, as he of woman was yborne.<p>

The groome went streight way in, and to his Lord<br>
Declar'd the message, which that Knight did moue;<br>
Who sitting with his Lady then at bord,<br>
Not onely did not his demaund [ap]proue,<br>
But both himselfe reuil'd, and eke his loue;<br>
Albe his Lady, that <i>Blandina</i> hight,<br>
Him of vngentle vsage did [re]proue<br>
And earnestly entreated that they might<br>
Finde fauour to be lodged there for that same night.<p>

Yet would he not perswaded be for ought,<br>
Ne from his currish will awhit reclame.<br>
Which answer when the groome returning, brought<br>
To <i>Calepine</i>, his heart did inly flame<br>
With wrathfull fury for so foule a shame,<br>
That he could not thereof auenged bee:<br>
But most for pitty of his dearest Dame,<br>
Whom now in deadly daunger he did see;<br>
Yet had no meanes to comfort, nor procure her glee.<p>

But all in vaine; for why, no remedy<br>
He saw, the present mischiefe to redresse,<br>
But th'vtmost end perforce for to aby,<br>
Which that nights fortune would for him addresse.<br>
So downe he tooke his Lady in distresse,<br>
And layd her vnderneath a bush to sleepe,<br>
Couer'd with cold, and wrapt in wretchednesse,<br>
Whiles he him selfe all night did nought but weepe,<br>
And wary watch about her for her safegard keepe.<p>

The morrow next, so soone as ioyous day<br>
Did shew it selfe in sunny beames bedight,<br>
<i>Serena</i> full of dolorous dismay,<br>
Twixt darkenesse dread, and hope of liuing light,<br>
Vprear'd her head to see that chearefull sight.<br>
Then <i>Calepine</i>, how euer inly wroth,<br>
And greedy to auenge that vile despight,<br>
Yet for the feeble Ladies sake, full loth<br>
To make there lenger stay, forth on his iourney goth.<p>

He goth on foote all armed by her side,<br>
Vpstaying still her selfe vppon her steede,<br>
Being vnhable else alone to ride;<br>
So sore her sides, so much her wounds did bleede:<br>
Till that at length, in his extreamest neede,<br>
He chaunst far off an armed Knight to spy,<br>
Pursuing him apace with greedy speede,<br>
Whom well he wist to be some enemy,<br>
That meant to make aduantage of his misery.<p>

Wherefore he stayd, till that he nearer drew,<br>
To weet what issue would thereof betyde,<br>
Tho whenas he approched nigh in vew,<br>
By certaine signes he plainely him descryde,<br>
To be the man, that with such scornefull pryde<br>
Had him abusde, and shamed yesterday;<br>
Therefore misdoubting, least he should misguyde<br>
His former malice to some new assay,<br>
He cast to keepe him selfe so safely as he may.<p>

By this the other came in place likewise,<br>
And couching close his speare and all his powre,<br>
As bent to some malicious enterprise,<br>
He bad him stand, t'abide the bitter stoure<br>
Of his sore vengeaunce, or to make auoure<br>
Of the lewd words and deedes, which he had done:<br>
With that ran at him, as he would deuoure<br>
His life attonce; who nought could do, but shun<br>
The perill of his pride, or else be ouerrun.<p>

Yet he him still pursew'd from place to place,<br>
Will full intent him cruelly to kill;<br>
And like a wilde goate round about did chace,<br>
Flying the fury of his bloudy will.<br>
But his best succour and refuge was still<br>
Behinde his Ladies backe, who to him cryde,<br>
And called oft with prayers loud and shrill,<br>
As euer he to Lady was affyde,<br>
To spare her Knight, and rest with reason pacifyde.<p>

But he the more thereby enraged was,<br>
And with more eager felnesse him pursew'd:<br>
So that at length, after long weary chace,<br>
Hauing by chaunce a close aduantage vew'd,<br>
He ouer raught him, hauing long eschew'd<br>
His violence in vaine, and with his spere<br>
Strooke through his shoulder, that the blood ensew'd<br>
In great aboundance, as a well it were,<br>
That forth out of an hill fresh gushing did appere.<p>

Yet ceast he not for all that cruell wound,<br>
But chaste him still, for all his Ladies cry;<br>
Not satisfyde till on the fatall ground<br>
He saw his life powrd forth dispiteously:<br>
The which was certes in great ieopardy,<br>
Had not a wondrous chaunce his reskue wrought,<br>
And saued from his cruell villany.<br>
Such chaunces oft exceed all humaine thought:<br>
That in another Canto shall to end be brought.<p>
