*Cant. XII.*

> *The maske of Cupid, and th'enchaunted  
> Chamber are displayd,  
> Whence Britomart redeemes faire  
> Amoret, through charmes decayd.*

> T Ho when as chearelesse Night ycouered had  
> Faire heauen with an vniuersall cloud,  
> That euery wight dismayd with darknesse sad,  
> In silence and in sleepe themselues did shroud,  
> She heard a shrilling Trompet sound aloud,  
> Signe of nigh battell, or got victory;  
> Nought therewith daunted was her courage proud,  
> But rather stird to cruell enmity,  
> Expecting euer, when some foe she might descry.
>
> With that, an hideous storme of winde arose,  
> With dreadfull thunder and lightning atwixt,  
> And an earth-quake, as if it streight would lose  
> The worlds foundations from his centre fixt;  
> A direfull stench of smoke and sulphure mixt  
> Ensewd, whose noyance fild the fearefull sted,  
> From the fourth houre of night vntill the sixt;  
> Yet the bold *Britonesse* was nought ydred,  
> Though much emmou'd, but stedfast still perseuered.
>
> All suddenly a stormy whirlwind blew  
> Throughout the house, that clapped euery dore,  
> With which that yron wicket open flew,  
> As it with mightie leuers had bene tore:  
> And forth issewd, as on the ready flore  
> Of some Theatre, a graue personage,  
> That in his hand a branch of laurell bore,  
> With comely haueour and count'nance sage,  
> Yclad in costly garments, fit for tragicke Stage.
>
> Proceeding to the midst, he still did stand,  
> As if in mind he somewhat had to say,  
> And to the vulgar beckning with his hand,  
> In signe of silence, as to heare a play,  
> By liuely actions he gan bewray  
> Some argument of matter passioned;  
> Which doen, he backe retyred soft away,  
> And passing by, his name discouered,  
> *Ease*, on his robe in golden letters cyphered.
>
> The noble Mayd, still standing all this vewd,  
> And merueild at his strange intendiment;  
> With that a ioyous fellowship issewd  
> Of Minstrals, making goodly meriment,  
> With wanton Bardes, and Rymers impudent,  
> All which together sung full chearefully  
> A lay of loues delight, with sweet consent:  
> After whom marcht a iolly company,  
> In manner of a maske, enranged orderly.
>
> The whiles a most delitious harmony,  
> In full straunge notes was sweetly heard to sound,  
> That the rare sweetnesse of the melody  
> The feeble senses wholly did confound,  
> And the fraile soule in deepe delight nigh dround:  
> And when it ceast, shrill trompets loud did bray,  
> That their report did farre away rebound,  
> And when they ceast, it gan againe to play,  
> The whiles the maskers marched forth in trim aray.
>
> The first was *Fancy*, like a louely boy,  
> Of rare aspect, and beautie without peare;  
> Matchable either to that ympe of *Troy*,  
> Whom *Ioue* did loue, and chose his cup to beare,  
> Or that same daintie lad, which was so deare  
> To great *Alcides*, that when as he dyde,  
> He wailed womanlike with many a teare,  
> And euery wood, and euery valley wyde  
> He fild with *Hylas* name; the Nymphes eke *Hylas* cryde.
>
> His garment neither was of silke nor say,  
> But painted plumes, in goodly order dight,  
> Like as the sunburnt *Indians* do aray  
> Their tawney bodies, in their proudest plight:  
> As those same plumes, so seemd he vaine and light,  
> That by his gate might easily appeare;  
> For still he far'd as dauncing in delight,  
> And in his hand a windy fan did beare,  
> That in the idle aire he mou'd still here and there.
>
> And him beside marcht amorous *Desyre*,  
> Who seemd of riper yeares, then th'other Swaine,  
> Yet was that other swayne this elders syre,  
> And gaue him being, commune to them twaine:  
> His garment was disguised very vaine,  
> And his embrodered Bonet sat awry;  
> Twixt both his hands few sparkes he close did straine,  
> Which still he blew, and kindled busily,  
> That soone they life conceiu'd, & forth in flames did fly.
>
> Next after him went *Doubt*, who was yclad  
> In a discolour'd cote, of straunge disguyse,  
> That at his backe a brode Capuccio had,  
> And sleeues dependant *Albanese*-wyse:  
> He lookt askew with his mistrustfull eyes,  
> And nicely trode, as thornes lay in his way,  
> Or that the flore to shrinke he did auyse,  
> And on a broken reed he still did stay  
> His feeble steps, which shrunke, when hard theron he lay.
>
> With him went *Daunger*, cloth'd in ragged weed,  
> Made of Beares skin, that him more dreadfull made,  
> Yet his owne face was dreadfull, ne did need  
> Straunge horrour, to deforme his griesly shade;  
> A net in th'one hand, and a rustie blade  
> In th'other was, this Mischiefe, that Mishap;  
> With th'one his foes he threatned to inuade,  
> With th'other he his friends ment to enwrap:  
> For whom he could not kill, he practizd to entrap.
>
> Next him was *Feare*, all arm'd from top to toe,  
> Yet thought himselfe not safe enough thereby,  
> But feard each shadow mouing to and fro,  
> And his owne armes when glittering he did spy,  
> Or clashing heard, he fast away did fly,  
> As ashes pale of hew, and wingyheeld;  
> And euermore on daunger fixt his eye,  
> Gainst whom he alwaies bent a brasen shield,  
> Which his right hand vnarmed fearefully did wield.
>
> With him went *Hope* in rancke, a handsome Mayd,  
> Of chearefull looke and louely to behold;  
> In silken samite she was light arayd,  
> And her faire lockes were wouen vp in gold;  
> She alway smyld, and in her hand did hold  
> An holy water Sprinckle, dipt in deowe,  
> With which she sprinckled fauours manifold,  
> On whom she list, and did great liking sheowe,  
> Great liking vnto many, but true loue to feowe.
>
> And after them *Dissemblance*, and *Suspect*  
> Marcht in one rancke, yet an vnequall paire:  
> For she was gentle, and of milde aspect,  
> Courteous to all, and seeming debonaire,  
> Goodly adorned, and exceeding faire:  
> Yet was that all but painted, and purloynd,  
> And her bright browes were deckt with borrowed haire:  
> Her deedes were forged, and her words false coynd,  
> And alwaies in her hand two clewes of silke she twynd.
>
> But he was foule, ill fauoured, and grim,  
> Vnder his eyebrowes looking still askaunce;  
> And euer as *Dissemblance* laught on him,  
> He lowrd on her with daungerous eyeglaunce;  
> Shewing his nature in his countenance;  
> His rolling eyes did neuer rest in place,  
> But walkt each where, for feare of hid mischaunce,  
> Holding a lattice still before his face,  
> Through which he still did peepe, as forward he did pace.
>
> Next him went *Griefe*, and *Fury* matcht yfere;  
> *Griefe* all in sable sorrowfully clad,  
> Downe hanging his dull head, with heauy chere,  
> Yet inly being more, then seeming sad:  
> A paire of Pincers in his hand he had,  
> With which he pinched people to the hart,  
> That from thenceforth a wretched life they lad,  
> In wilfull languor and consuming smart,  
> Dying each day with inward wounds of dolours dart.
>
> But *Fury* was full ill appareiled  
> In rags, that naked nigh she did appeare,  
> With ghastly lookes and dreadfull drerihed;  
> For from her backe her garments she did teare,  
> And from her head oft rent her snarled heare:  
> In her right hand a firebrand she did tosse  
> About her head, still roming here and there;  
> As a dismayed Deare in chace embost,  
> Forgetfull of his safety, hath his right way lost.
>
> After them went *Displeasure* and *Pleasance*,  
> He looking lompish and full sullein sad,  
> And hanging downe his heauy countenance;  
> She chearefull fresh and full of ioyance glad,  
> As if no sorrow she ne felt ne drad;  
> That euill matched paire they seemd to bee:  
> An angry Waspe th'one in a viall had  
> Th'other in hers an hony-lady Bee;  
> Thus marched these sixe couples forth in faire degree.
>
> After all these there marcht a most faire Dame,  
> Led of two grysie villeins, th'one *Despight*,  
> The other cleped *Cruelty* by name:  
> She dolefull Lady, like a dreary Spright,  
> Cald by strong charmes out of eternall night,  
> Had deathes owne image figurd in her face,  
> Full of sad signes, fearefull to liuing sight;  
> Yet in that horror shewd a seemely grace,  
> And with her feeble feet did moue a comely pace.
>
> Her brest all naked, as net iuory,  
> Without adorne of gold or siluer bright,  
> Wherewith the Craftesman wonts it beautify,  
> Of her dew honour was despoyled quight,  
> And a wide wound therein (O ruefull sight)  
> Entrenched deepe with knife accursed keene,  
> Yet freshly bleeding forth her fainting spright,  
> (The worke of cruell hand) was to be seene,  
> That dyde in sanguine red her skin all snowy cleene.
>
> At that wide orifice her trembling hart  
> Was drawne forth, and in siluer basin layd,  
> Quite through transfixed with a deadly dart,  
> And in her bloud yet steeming fresh embayd:  
> And those two villeins, which her steps vpstayd,  
> When her weake feete could scarcely her sustaine,  
> And fading vitall powers gan to fade,  
> Her forward still with torture did constraine,  
> And euermore encreased her consuming paine.
>
> Next after her the winged God himselfe  
> Came riding on a Lion rauenous,  
> Taught to obay the menage of that Elfe,  
> That man and beast with powre imperious  
> Subdeweth to his kingdome tyrannous:  
> His blindfold eyes he bad a while vnbind,  
> That his proud spoyle of that same dolorous  
> Faire Dame he might behold in perfect kind;  
> Which seene, he much reioyced in his cruell mind.
>
> Of which full proud, himselfe vp rearing hye,  
> He looked round about with sterne disdaine;  
> And did suruay his goodly company:  
> And marshalling the euill ordered traine,  
> With that the darts which his right hand did straine,  
> Full dreadfully he shooke that all did quake,  
> And clapt on hie his coulourd winges twaine,  
> That all his many it affraide did make:  
> Tho blinding him againe, his way he forth did take.
>
> Behinde him was *Reproch*, *Repentance*, *Shame*;  
> *Reproch* the first, *Shame* next, *Repent* behind:  
> *Repentance* feeble, sorrowfull, and lame:  
> *Reproch* despightfull, carelesse, and vnkind;  
> *Shame* most ill fauourd, bestiall, and blind:  
> *Shame* lowrd, *Repentance* sigh'd, *Reproch* did scould;  
> *Reproch* sharpe stings, *Repentance* whips entwind,  
> *Shame* burning brond-yrons in her hand did hold:  
> All three to each vnlike, yet all made in one mould.
>
> And after them a rude confused rout  
> Of persons flockt, whose names is hard to read:  
> Emongst them was sterne *Strife*, and *Anger* stout,  
> Vnquiet *Care*, and fond *Vnthriftihead*,  
> Lewd *Losse of Time*, and *Sorrow* seeming dead,  
> Inconstant *Chaunge*, and false *Disloyaltie*,  
> Consuming *Riotise*, and guilty *Dread*  
> Of heauenly vengeance, faint *Infirmitie*,  
> Vile *Pouertie*, and lastly *Death* with infamie.
>
> There were full many moe like maladies,  
> Whose names and natures I note readen well;  
> So many moe, as there be phantasies  
> In wauering wemens wit, that none can tell,  
> Or paines in loue, or punishments in hell;  
> All which disguized marcht in masking wise,  
> About the chamber with that Damozell,  
> And then returned, hauing marched thrise,  
> Into the inner roome, from whence they first did rise.
>
> So soone as they were in, the dore streight way  
> Fast locked, driuen with that stormy blast,  
> Which first it opened; and bore all away.  
> Then the braue Maid, which all this while was plast,  
> In secret shade, and saw both first and last,  
> Issewed forth, and went vnto the dore,  
> To enter in, but found it locked fast:  
> It vaine she thought with rigorous vprore  
> For to efforce, when charmes had closed it afore.
>
> Where force might not auaile, their sleights and art  
> She cast to vse, both fit for hard emprize;  
> For thy, from that same roome not to depart  
> Till morrow next, she did her selfe auize,  
> When that same Maske againe should forth arize.  
> The morrow next appeard with ioyous cheare,  
> Calling men to their daily exercize,  
> Then she, as morrow fresh, her selfe did reare  
> Out of her secret stand, that day for to out weare.
>
> All that day she outwore in wandering,  
> And gazing on that Chambers ornament,  
> Till that againe the second euening  
> Her couered with her sable vestiment,  
> Wherewith the worlds faire beautie she hath blent:  
> Then when the second watch was almost past,  
> That brasen dore flew open, and in went  
> Bold *Britomart*, as she had late forecast,  
> Neither of idle shewes, nor of false charmes aghast.
>
> So soone as she was entred, round about  
> She cast her eies, to see what was become  
> Of all those persons, which she saw without:  
> But lo, they streight were vanisht all and some,  
> Ne liuing wight she saw in all that roome,  
> Saue that same woefull Ladie, both whose hands  
> Were bounden fast, that did her ill become,  
> And her small wast girt round with yron bands,  
> Vnto a brasen pillour, by the which she stands.
>
> And her before the vile Enchaunter sate,  
> Figuring straunge characters of his art,  
> With liuing bloud he those characters wrate,  
> Dreadfully dropping from her dying hart,  
> Seeming transfixed with a cruell dart,  
> And all perforce to make her him to loue.  
> Ah who can loue the worker of her smart?  
> A thousand charmes he formerly did proue;  
> Yet thousand charmes could not her stedfast heart remoue.
>
> Soone as that virgin knight he saw in place,  
> His wicked bookes in hast he ouerthrew,  
> Not caring his long labours to deface,  
> And fiercely ronning to that Lady trew,  
> A murdrous knife out of his pocket drew,  
> The which he thought, for villeinous despight,  
> In her tormented bodie to embrew:  
> But the stout Damzell to him leaping light,  
> His cursed hand withheld, and maistered his might.
>
> From her, to whom his fury first he ment,  
> The wicked weapon rashly he did wrest,  
> And turning to her selfe his fell intent,  
> Vnwares it strooke into her snowie chest,  
> That little drops empurpled her faire brest.  
> Exceeding wroth therewith the virgin grew,  
> Albe the wound were nothing deepe imprest,  
> And fiercely forth her mortall blade she drew,  
> To giue him the reward for such vile outrage dew.
>
> So mightily she smote him, that to ground  
> He fell halfe dead; next stroke him should haue slaine,  
> Had not the Lady, which by him stood bound,  
> Dernely vnto her called to abstaine,  
> From doing him to dy. For else her paine  
> Should be remedilesse, sith none but hee,  
> Which wrought it, could the same recure againe.  
> Therewith she stayd her hand, loth stayd to bee;  
> For life she him enuyde, and long'd reuenge to see.
>
> And to him said, Thou wicked man, whose meed  
> For so huge mischiefe, and vile villany  
> Is death, or if that ought do death exceed,  
> Be sure, that nought may saue thee from to dy,  
> But if that thou this Dame doe presently  
> Restore vnto her health, and former state;  
> This doe and liue, else die vndoubtedly.  
> He glad of life, that lookt for death but late,  
> Did yield himselfe right willing to prolong his date.
>
> And rising vp, gan streight to ouerlooke,  
> Those cursed leaues, his charmes backe to reuerse;  
> Full dreadfull things out of that balefull booke  
> He red, and measur'd many a sad verse,  
> That horror gan the virgins hart to perse,  
> And her faire locks vp stared stiffe on end,  
> Hearing him those same bloudy lines reherse;  
> And all the while he red, she did extend  
> Her sword high ouer him, if ought he did offend.
>
> Anon she gan perceiue the house to quake,  
> And all the dores to rattle round about;  
> Yet all that did not her dismaied make,  
> Nor slacke her threatfull hand for daungers dout,  
> But still with stedfast eye and courage stout  
> Abode, to weet what end would come of all.  
> At last that mightie chaine, which round about  
> Her tender waste was wound, adowne gan fall,  
> And that great brasen pillour broke in peeces small.
>
> The cruell steele, which thrild her dying hart,  
> Fell softly forth, as of his owne accord,  
> And the wyde wound, which lately did dispart  
> Her bleeding brest, and riuen bowels gor'd,  
> Was closed vp, as it had not bene bor'd,  
> And euery part to safety full sound,  
> As she were neuer hurt, was soone restor'd:  
> Tho when she felt her selfe to be vnbound,  
> And perfect hole, prostrate she fell vnto the ground.
>
> Before faire *Britomart*, she fell prostrate,
