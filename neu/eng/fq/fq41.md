*Cant. II.*

> *Blandamour winnes false Florimell,  
> Paridell for her striues,  
> They are accorded: Agape  
> doth lengthen her sonnes liues.*

> F Irebrand of hell first tynd in Phlegeton,  
> By thousand furies, and from thence out throwen  
> Into this world, to worke confusion,  
> And set it all on fire by force vnknowen,  
> Is wicked discord, whose small sparkes once blowen  
> None but a God or godlike man can slake;  
> Such as was *Orpheus*, that when strife was growen  
> Amongst those famous ympes of Greece, did take  
> His siluer Harpe in hand, and shortly friends them make.
>
> Or such as that celestiall Psalmist was,  
> That when the wicked feend his Lord tormented,  
> With heauenly notes, that did all other pas,  
> The outrage of his furious fit relented.  
> Such Musicke is wise words with time concented,  
> To moderate stiffe minds, disposd to striue:  
> Such as that prudent Romane well inuented,  
> What time his people into partes did riue,  
> Them reconcyld againe, and to their homes did driue.
>
> Such vs'd wise *Glauce* to that wrathfull knight,  
> To calme the tempest of his troubled thought:  
> Yet *Blandamour* with termes of foule despight,  
> And *Paridell* her scornd, and set at nought,  
> As old and crooked and not good for ought.  
> Both they vnwise, and warelesse of the euill,  
> That by themselues vnto themselues is wrought,  
> Through that false witch, and that foule aged dreuill,  
> The one a feend, the other an incarnate deuill.
>
> With whom as they thus rode accompanide,  
> They were encountred of a lustie Knight,  
> That had a goodly Ladie by his side,  
> To whom he made great dalliance and delight.  
> It was to weete the bold Sir *Ferraugh* hight,  
> He that from *Braggadocchio* whilome reft  
> The snowy *Florimell*, whose beautie bright  
> Made him seeme happie for so glorious theft;  
> Yet was it in due triall but a wandring weft.
>
> Which when as *Blandamour*, whose fancie light  
> Was alwaies flitting as the wauering wind,  
> After each beautie, that appeard in sight,  
> Beheld, eftsoones it prickt his wanton mind  
> With sting of lust, that reasons eye did blind,  
> That to Sir *Paridell* these words he sent;  
> Sir knight why ride ye dumpish thus behind,  
> Since so good fortune doth to you present  
> So fayre a spoyle, to make you ioyous meriment?
>
> But *Paridell* that had too late a tryall  
> Of the bad issue of his counsell vaine,  
> List not to hearke, but made this faire denyall;  
> Last turne was mine, well proued to my paine,  
> This now be yours, God send you better gaine.  
> Whose scoffed words he taking halfe in scorne,  
> Fiercely forth prickt his steed as in disdaine,  
> Against that Knight, ere he him well could torne  
> By meanes whereof he hath him lightly ouerborne.
>
> Who with the sudden stroke astonisht sore,  
> Vpon the ground a while in slomber lay;  
> The whiles his loue away the other bore,  
> And shewing her, did *Paridell* vpbray;  
> Lo sluggish Knight the victors happie pray:  
> So fortune friends the bold: whom *Paridell*  
> Seeing so faire indeede, as he did say,  
> His hart with secret enuie gan to swell,  
> And inly grudge at him, that he had sped so well.
>
> Nathlesse proud man himselfe the other deemed,  
> Hauing so peerelesse paragon ygot:  
> For sure the fayrest *Florimell* him seemed,  
> To him was fallen for his happie lot,  
> Whose like aliue on earth he weened not:  
> Therefore he her did court, did serue, did wooe,  
> With humblest suit that he imagine mot,  
> And all things did deuise, and all things dooe,  
> That might her loue prepare, and liking win theretoo.
>
> She in regard thereof him recompenst  
> With golden words, and goodly countenance,  
> And such fond fauours sparingly dispenst:  
> Sometimes him blessing with a light eye-glance,  
> And coy lookes tempring with loose dalliance;  
> Sometimes estranging him in sterner wise,  
> That hauing cast him in a foolish trance,  
> He seemed brought to bed in Paradise,  
> And prou'd himselfe most foole, in what he seem'd most wise.
>
> So great a mistresse of her art she was,  
> And perfectly practiz'd in womans craft,  
> That though therein himselfe he thought to pas,  
> And by his false allurements wylie draft  
> Had thousand women of their loue beraft,  
> Yet now he was surpriz'd: for that false spright,  
> Which that same witch had in this forme engraft,  
> Was so expert in euery subtile slight,  
> That it could ouerreach the wisest earthly wight.
>
> Yet he to her did dayly seruice more,  
> And dayly more deceiued was thereby;  
> Yet *Paridell* him enuied therefore,  
> As seeming plast in sole felicity:  
> So blind is lust, false colours to descry.  
> But *Ate* soone discouering his desire,  
> And finding now fit opportunity  
> To stirre vp strife, twixt loue and spight and ire,  
> Did priuily put coles vnto his secret fire.
>
> By sundry meanes thereto she prickt him forth,  
> Now with remembrance of those spightfull speaches,  
> Now with opinion of his owne more worth,  
> Now with recounting of like former breaches  
> Made in their friendship, as that Hag him teaches:  
> And euer when his passion is allayd,  
> She it reuiues and new occasion reaches:  
> That on a time as they together way'd,  
> He made him open chalenge, and thus boldly sayd.
>
> Too boastfull *Blandamour*, too long I beare  
> The open wrongs, thou doest me day by day;  
> Well know'st thou, whe˜ we friendship first did sweare,  
> The couenant was, that euery spoyle or pray  
> Should equally be shard betwixt vs tway:  
> Where is my part then of this Ladie bright,  
> Whom to thy selfe thou takest quite away?  
> Render therefore therein to me my right,  
> Or answere for thy wrong, as shall fall out in fight.
>
> Exceeding wroth thereat was *Blandamour*,  
> And gan this bitter answere to him make;  
> Too foolish *Paridell*, that fayrest floure  
> Wouldst gather faine, and yet no paines wouldst take:  
> But not so easie will I her forsake;  
> This hand her wonne, this hand shall her defend.  
> With that they gan their shiuering speares to shake,  
> And deadly points at eithers breast to bend,  
> Forgetfull each to haue bene euer others frend.
>
> Their firie Steedes with so vntamed forse  
> Did beare them both to fell auenges end,  
> That both their speares with pitilesse remorse,  
> Through shield and mayle, and haberieon did wend,  
> And in their flesh a griesly passage rend,  
> That with the furie of their owne affret,  
> Each other horse and man to ground did send;  
> Where lying still a while, both did forget  
> The perilous present stownd, in which their liues were set.
>
> As when two warlike Brigandines at sea,  
> With murdrous weapons arm'd to cruell fight,  
> Doe meete together on the watry lea,  
> They stemme ech other with so fell despight,  
> That with the shocke of their owne heedlesse might,  
> Their wooden ribs are shaken nigh a sonder;  
> They which from shore behold the dreadfull sight  
> Of flashing fire, and heare the ordenance thonder,  
> Do greatly stand amaz'd at such vnwonted wonder.
>
> At length they both vpstarted in amaze;  
> As men awaked rashly out of dreme,  
> And round about themselues a while did gaze,  
> Till seeing her, that *Florimell* did seme,  
> In doubt to whom she victorie should deeme,  
> Therewith their dulled sprights they edgd anew,  
> And drawing both their swords with rage extreme,  
> Like two mad mastiffes each on other flew,  
> And shields did share, & mailes did rash, and helmes did hew.
>
> So furiously each other did assayle,  
> As if their soules they would attonce haue rent  
> Out of their brests, that streames of bloud did rayle  
> Adowne, as if their springes of life were spent;  
> That all the ground with purple bloud was sprent,  
> And all their armours staynd with bloudie gore,  
> Yet scarcely once to breath would they relent,  
> So mortall was their malice and so sore,  
> Become of fayned friendship which they vow'd afore.
>
> And that which is for Ladies most befitting,  
> To stint all strife, and foster friendly peace,  
> Was from those Dames so farre and so vnfitting,  
> As that in stead of praying them surcease,  
> They did much more their cruelty encrease;  
> Bidding them fight for honour of their loue,  
> And rather die then Ladies cause release.  
> With which vaine termes so much they did the˜ moue,  
> That both resolu'd the last extremities to proue.
>
> There they I weene would fight vntill this day,  
> Had not a Squire, euen he the Squire of Dames,  
> By great aduenture trauelled that way;  
> Who seeing both bent to so bloudy games,  
> And both of old well knowing by their names,  
> Drew nigh, to weete the cause of their debate:  
> And first laide on those Ladies thousand blames,  
> That did not seeke t'appease their deadly hate,  
> But gazed on their harmes, not pittying their estate.
>
> And then those Knights he humbly did beseech,  
> To stay their hands, till he a while had spoken:  
> Who lookt a little vp at that his speech,  
> Yet would not let their battell so be broken,  
> Both greedie fiers on other to be wroken.  
> Yet he to them so earnestly did call,  
> And them coniur'd by some well knowen token,  
> That they at last their wrothfull hands let fall,  
> Content to heare him speake, and glad to rest withall.
>
> First he desir'd their cause of strife to see:  
> They said, it was for loue of *Florimell*.  
> Ah gentle knights (quoth he) how may that bee,  
> And she so farre astray, as none can tell.  
> Fond Squire, full angry then sayd *Paridell*,  
> Seest not the Ladie there before thy face?  
> He looked backe, and her aduizing well,  
> Weend as he said, by that her outward grace,  
> That fayrest *Florimell* was present there in place.
>
> Glad man was he to see that ioyous sight,  
> For none aliue but ioy'd in *Florimell*,  
> And lowly to her lowting thus behight;  
> Fayrest of faire, that fairenesse doest excell,  
> This happie day I haue to greete you well,  
> In which you safe I see, whom thousand late,  
> Misdoubted lost through mischiefe that befell;  
> Long may you liue in health and happie state.  
> She litle answer'd him, but lightly did aggrate.
>
> Then turning to those Knights, he gan a new;  
> And you Sir *Blandamour* and *Paridell*,  
> That for this Ladie present in your vew,  
> Haue rays'd this cruell warre and outrage fell,  
> Certes me seemes bene not aduised well,  
> But rather ought in friendship for her sake  
> To ioyne your force, their forces to repell,  
> That seeke perforce her from you both to take,  
> And of your gotten spoyle their owne triumph to make.
>
> Thereat Sir *Blandamour* with countenance sterne,  
> All full of wrath, thus fiercely him bespake;  
> A read thou Squire, that I the man may learne,  
> That dare fro me thinke *Florimell* to take.  
> Not one (quoth he) but many doe partake  
> Herein, as thus. It lately so befell,  
> That *Satyran* a girdle did vptake,  
> Well knowne to appertaine to *Florimell*,  
> Which for her sake he wore, as him beseemed well.
>
> But when as she her selfe was lost and gone,  
> Full many knights, that loued her like deare,  
> Thereat did greatly grudge, that he alone  
> That lost faire Ladies ornament should weare,  
> And gan therefore close spight to him to beare:  
> Which he to shun, and stop vile enuies sting,  
> Hath lately caus'd to be proclaim'd each where  
> A solemne feast, with publike turneying,  
> To which all knights with them their Ladies are to bring.
>
> And of them all she that is fayrest found,  
> Shall haue that golden girdle for reward,  
> And of those Knights who is most stout on ground,  
> Shall to that fairest Ladie be prefard.  
> Since therefore she her selfe is now your ward,  
> To you that ornament of hers pertaines,  
> Against all those, that chalenge it to gard,  
> And saue her honour with your ventrous paines;  
> That shall you win more glory, then ye here find gaines.
>
> When they the reason of his words had hard,  
> They gan abate the rancour of their rage,  
> And with their honours and their loues regard,  
> The furious flames of malice to asswage.  
> Tho each to other did his faith engage,  
> Like faithfull friends thenceforth to ioyne in one  
> With all their force, and battell strong to wage  
> Gainst all those knights, as their professed fone,  
> That chaleng'd ought in *Florimell*, saue they alone.
>
> So well accorded forth they rode together  
> In friendly sort, that lasted but a while;  
> And of all old dislikes they made faire weather,  
> Yet all was forg'd and spred with golden foyle,  
> That vnder it hidde hate and hollow guyle.  
> Ne certes can that friendship long endure,  
> How euer gay and goodly be the style,  
> That doth ill cause or euill end enure:  
> For vertue is the band, that bindeth harts most sure.
>
> Thus as they marched all in close disguise,  
> Of fayned loue, they chaunst to ouertake  
> Two knights, that lincked rode in louely wise,  
> As if they secret counsels did partake;  
> And each not farre behinde him had his make,  
> To weete, two Ladies of most goodly hew,  
> That twixt themselues did gentle purpose make  
> Vnmindfull both of that discordfull crew,  
> The which with speedie pace did after them pursew.
>
> Who as they now approched nigh at hand,  
> Deeming them doughtie as they did appeare,  
> They sent that Squire afore, to vnderstand,  
> What mote they be: who viewing them more neare  
> Returned readie newes, that those same weare  
> Two of the prowest Knights in Faery lond;  
> And those two Ladies their two louers deare,  
> Couragious *Cambell*, and stout *Triamond*,  
> With *Canacee* and *Cambine* linckt in louely bond.
>
> Whylome as antique stories tellen vs,  
> Those two were foes the fellonest on ground,  
> And battell made the dreddest daungerous,  
> That euer shrilling trumpet did resound;  
> Though now their acts be no where to be found,  
> As that renowmed Poet them compyled,  
> With warlike numbers and Heroicke sound,  
> Dan *Chaucer*, well of English vndefyled,  
> On Fames eternall beadroll worthie to be fyled.
>
> But wicked Time that all good thoughts doth waste,  
> And workes of noblest wits to nought out weare,  
> That famous moniment hath quite defaste,  
> And robd the world of threasure endlesse deare,  
> The which mote haue enriched all vs heare.  
> O cursed Eld the cankerworme of writs,  
> How may these rimes, so rude as doth appeare,  
> Hope to endure, sith workes of heauenly wits  
> Are quite deuourd, and brought to nought by little bits?
>
> Then pardon, O most sacred happie spirit,  
> That I thy labours lost may thus reuiue,  
> And steale from thee the meede of thy due merit,  
> That none durst euer whilest thou wast aliue,  
> And being dead in vaine yet many striue:  
> Ne dare I like, but through infusion sweete  
> Of thine owne spirit, which doth in me suruiue,  
> I follow here the footing of thy feete,  
> That with thy meaning so I may the rather meete.
>
> *Cambelloes* sister was fayre *Canacee*,  
> That was the learnedst Ladie in her dayes,  
> Well seene in euerie science that mote bee,  
> And euery secret worke of natures wayes,  
> In wittie riddles, and in wise soothsayes,  
> In power of herbes, and tunes of beasts and burds;  
> And, that augmented all her other prayse,  
> She modest was in all her deedes and words,  
> And wondrous chast of life, yet lou'd of Knights & Lords.
>
> Full many Lords, and many Knights her loued,  
> Yet she to none of them her liking lent,  
> Ne euer was with fond affection moued,  
> But rul'd her thoughts with goodly gouernement,  
> For dread of blame and honours blemishment;  
> And eke vnto her lookes a law she made,  
> That none of them once out of order went,  
> But like to warie Centonels well stayd,  
> Still watcht on euery side, of secret foes affrayd.
>
> So much the more as she refusd to loue,  
> So much the more she loued was and sought,  
> That oftentimes vnquiet strife did moue  
> Amongst her louers, and great quarrels wrought,  
> That oft for her in bloudie armes they fought.  
> Which whenas *Cambell*, that was stout and wise,  
> Perceiu'd would breede great mischiefe, he bethought  
> How to preuent the perill that mote rise,  
> And turne both him and her to honour in this wise.
>
> One day, when all that troupe of warlike wooers  
> Assembled were, to weet whose she should bee,  
> All mightie men and dreadfull derring dooers,  
> (The harder it to make them well agree)  
> Amongst them all this end he did decree;  
> That of them all, which loue to her did make,  
> They by consent should chose the stoutest three,  
> That with himselfe should combat for her sake,  
> And of them all the victour should his sister take.
>
> Bold was the chalenge, as himselfe was bold,  
> And courage full of haughtie hardiment,  
> Approued oft in perils manifold,  
> Which he atchieu'd to his great ornament:  
> But yet his sisters skill vnto him lent  
> Most confidence and hope of happie speed,  
> Conceiued by a ring, which she him sent,  
> That mongst the manie vertues, which we reed,  
> Had power to staunch al wounds, that mortally did bleed.
>
> Well was that rings great vertue knowen to all,  
> That dread thereof, and his redoubted might  
> Did all that youthly rout so much appall,  
> That none of them durst vndertake the fight;  
> More wise they weend to make of loue delight,  
> Then life to hazard for faire Ladies looke;  
> And yet vncertaine by such outward sight,  
> Though for her sake they all that perill tooke,  
> Whether she would them loue, or in her liking brooke.
>
> Amongst those knights there were three brethren bold,  
> Three bolder brethren neuer were yborne,  
> Borne of one mother in one happie mold,  
> Borne at one burden in one happie morne;  
> Thrise happie mother, and thrise happie morne,  
> That bore three such, three such not to be fond;  
> Her name was *Agape* whose children werne  
> All three as one, the first hight *Priamond*,  
> The second *Dyamond*, the youngest *Triamond*.
>
> Stout *Priamond*, but not so strong to strike,  
> Strong *Diamond*, but not so stout a knight,  
> But *Triamond* was stout and strong alike:  
> On horsebacke vsed *Triamond* to fight,  
> And *Priamond* on foote had more delight,  
> But horse and foote knew *Diamond* to wield:  
> With curtaxe vsed *Diamond* to smite,  
> And *Triamond* to handle speare and shield,  
> But speare and curtaxe both vsd *Priamond* in field.
>
> These three did loue each other dearely well,  
> And with so firme affection were allyde,  
> As if but one soule in them all did dwell,  
> Which did her powre into three parts diuyde;  
> Like three faire branches budding farre and wide,  
> That from one roote deriu'd their vitall sap:  
> And like that roote that doth her life diuide,  
> Their mother was, and had full blessed hap,  
> These three so noble babes to bring forth at one clap.
>
> Their mother was a Fay, and had the skill  
> Of secret things, and all the powres of nature,  
> Which she by art could vse vnto her will,  
> And to her seruice bind each liuing creature;  
> Through secret vnderstanding of their feature.  
> Thereto she was right faire, when so her face  
> She list discouer, and of goodly stature;  
> But she as Fayes are wont, in priuie place  
> Did spend her dayes, and lov'd in forests wyld to space.
>
> There on a day a noble youthly knight  
> Seeking aduentures in the saluage wood,  
> Did by great fortune get of her the sight;  
> As she sate carelesse by a cristall flood,  
> Combing her golden lockes, as seemd her good:  
> And vnawares vpon her laying hold,  
> That stroue in vaine him long to haue withstood,  
> Oppressed her, and there (as it is told)  
> Got these three louely babes, that prov'd three cha˜pions bold.
>
> Which she with her long fostred in that wood,  
> Till that to ripenesse of mans state they grew:  
> Then shewing forth signes of their fathers blood,  
> They loued armes, and knighthood did ensew,  
> Seeking aduentures, where they anie knew.  
> Which when their mother saw, she gan to dout  
> Their safetie, least by searching daungers new,  
> And rash prouoking perils all about,  
> Their days mote be abridged through their corage stout.
>
> Therefore desirous th'end of all their dayes  
> To know, and them t'enlarge with long extent,  
> By wondrous skill, and many hidden wayes,  
> To the three fatall sisters house she went.  
> Farre vnder ground from tract of liuing went,  
> Downe in the bottome of the deepe *Abysse*,  
> Where *Demogorgon* in dull darknesse pent,  
> Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,  
> The hideous *Chaos* keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.
>
> There she them found, all sitting round about  
> The direfull distaffe standing in the mid,  
> And with vnwearied fingers drawing out  
> The lines of life, from liuing knowledge hid.  
> Sad *Clotho* held the rocke, the whiles the thrid  
> By griesly *Lachesis* was spun with paine,  
> That cruell *Atropos* eftsoones vndid,  
> With cursed knife cutting the twist in twaine:  
> Most wretched men, whose dayes depend on thrids so vaine.
>
> She them saluting, there by them sate still,  
> Beholding how the thrids of life they span:  
> And when at last she had beheld her fill,  
> Trembling in heart, and looking pale and wan,  
> Her cause of comming she to tell began.  
> To whom fierce *Atropos*, Bold Fay, that durst  
> Come see the secret of the life of man,  
> Well worthie thou to be of *Ioue* accurst,  
> And eke thy childrens thrids to be asunder burst.
>
> Whereat she sore affrayd, yet her besought  
> To graunt her boone, and rigour to abate,  
> That she might see her childre˜s thrids forth brought,  
> And know the measure of their vtmost date,  
> To them ordained by eternall fate.  
> Which *Clotho* graunting, shewed her the same:  
> That when she saw, it did her much amate,  
> To see their thrids so thin, as spiders frame,  
> And eke so short, that seemd their ends out shortly came.
>
> She then began them humbly to intreate,  
> To draw them longer out, and better twine,  
> That so their liues might be prolonged late.  
> But *Lachesis* thereat gan to repine,  
> And sayd, Fond dame that deem'st of things diuine  
> As of humane, that they may altred bee,  
> And chaung'd at pleasure for those impes of thine.  
> Not so; for what the Fates do once decree,  
> Not all the gods can chaunge, nor *Ioue* him self can free.
>
> Then since (quoth she) the terme of each mans life  
> For nought may lessened nor enlarged bee,  
> Graunt this, that when ye shred with fatall knife  
> His line, which is the eldest of the three,  
> Which is of them the shortest, as I see,  
> Eftsoones his life may passe into the next;  
> And when the next shall likewise ended bee,  
> That both their liues may likewise be annext  
> Vnto the third, that his may so be trebly wext.
>
> They graunted it; and then that carefull Fay  
> Departed thence with full contended mynd;  
> And comming home, in warlike fresh aray  
> Them found all three according to their kynd:  
> But vnto them what destinie was assynd,  
> Or how their liues were eekt, she did not tell;  
> But euermore, when she fit time could fynd,  
> She warned them to tend their safeties well,  
> And loue each other deare, what euer them befell.
>
> So did they surely during all their dayes,  
> And neuer discord did amongst them fall;  
> Which much augmented all their other praise.  
> And now t'increase affection naturall,  
> In loue of *Canacee* they ioyned all:  
> Vpon which ground this same great battell grew,  
> Great matter growing of beginning small;  
> The which for length I will not here pursew,  
> But rather will reserue it for a Canto new.
