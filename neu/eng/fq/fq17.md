*Cant. IIII.*

> *Guyon does Furor bind in chaines,  
> and stops Occasion:  
> Deliuers Phedon, and therefore  
> by Strife is rayld vpon.*

> I N braue pursuit of honorable deed,  
> There is I know not what great difference  
> Betweene the vulgar and the noble seed,  
> Which vnto things of valorous pretence  
> Seemes to be borne by natiue influence;  
> As feates of armes, and loue to entertaine,  
> But chiefly skill to ride, seemes a science  
> Proper to gentle bloud; some others faine  
> To menage steeds, as did this vaunter; but in vaine.
>
> But he the rightfull owner of that steed,  
> Who well could menage and subdew his pride,  
> The whiles on foot was forced for to yeed,  
> With that blacke Palmer, his most trusty guide;  
> Who suffred not his wandring feet to slide.  
> But when strong passion, or weake fleshlinesse  
> Would from the right way seeke to draw him wide,  
> He would through temperance and stedfastnesse,  
> Teach him the weake to strengthen, & the strõg suppresse.
>
> It fortuned forth faring on his way,  
> He saw from farre, or seemed for to see  
> Some troublous vprore or contentious fray,  
> Whereto he drew in haste it to agree.  
> A mad man, or that feigned mad to bee,  
> Drew by the haire along vpon the ground,  
> A handsome stripling with great crueltee,  
> Whom sore he bett, and gor'd with many a wound,  
> That cheekes with teares, and sides with bloud did all abound.
>
> And him behind, a wicked Hag did stalke,  
> In ragged robes, and filthy disaray,  
> Her other leg was lame, that she no'te walke,  
> But on a staffe her feeble steps did stay;  
> Her lockes, that loathly were and hoarie gray,  
> Grew all afore, and loosely hong vnrold,  
> But all behind was bald, and worne away,  
> That none thereof could euer taken hold,  
> And eke her face ill fauourd, full of wrinckles old.
>
> And euer as she went, her tongue did walke  
> In foule reproch, and termes of vile despight,  
> Prouoking him by her outrageous talke,  
> To heape more vengeance on that wretched wight;  
> Sometimes she raught him stones, wherwith to smite,  
> Sometimes her staffe, though it her one leg were,  
> Withouten which she could not go vpright;  
> Ne any euill meanes she did forbeare,  
> That might him moue to wrath, and indignation reare.
>
> The noble *Guyon* mou'd with great remorse,  
> Approching, first the Hag did thrust away,  
> And after adding more impetuous forse,  
> His mightie hands did on the madman lay,  
> And pluckt him backe; who all on fire streightway,  
> Against him turning all his fell intent,  
> With beastly brutish rage gan him assay,  
> And smot, and bit, and kickt, and scratcht, and rent,  
> And did he wist not what in his auengement.
>
> And sure he was a man of mickle might,  
> Had he had gouernance, it well to guide:  
> But when the franticke fit inflamd his spright,  
> His force was vaine, and strooke more often wide,  
> Then at the aymed marke, which he had eide:  
> And oft himselfe he chaunst to hurt vnwares,  
> Whilst reason blent through passion, nought descride,  
> But as a blindfold Bull at randon fares,  
> And where he hits, nought knowes, & whom he hurts, nought cares.
>
> His rude assault and rugged handeling  
> Straunge seemed to the knight, that aye with foe  
> In faire defence and goodly menaging  
> Of armes was wont to fight, yet nathemoe  
> Was he abashed now not fighting so,  
> But more enfierced through his currish play,  
> Him sternely grypt, and haling to and fro,  
> To ouerthrow him strongly did assay,  
> But ouerthrew himselfe vnwares, and lower lay.
>
> And being downe the villein sore did beat,  
> And bruze with clownish fistes his manly face:  
> And eke the Hag with many a bitter threat,  
> Still cald vpon to kill him in the place.  
> With whose reproch and odious menace  
> The knight emboyling in his haughtie hart,  
> Knit all his forces, and gan soone vnbrace  
> His grasping hold: so lightly did vpstart,  
> And drew his deadly weapon, to maintain his part.
>
> Which when the Palmer saw, he loudly cryde,  
> Not so, ô *Guyon*, neuer thinke that so  
> That Monster can be maistred or destroyd:  
> He is not, ah, he is not such a foe,  
> As steele can wound, or strength can ouerthroe.  
> That same is *Furor*, cursed cruell wight,  
> That vnto knighthood workes much shame and woe;  
> And that same Hag, his aged mother, hight  
> *Occasion*, the root of all wrath and despight.
>
> With her, who so will raging *Furor* tame,  
> Must first begin, and well her amenage:  
> First her restraine from her reprochfull blame,  
> And euill meanes, with which she doth enrage  
> Her franticke sonne, and kindles his courage,  
> Then when she is withdrawen, or strong withstood,  
> It's eath his idle furie to asswage,  
> And calme the tempest of his passion wood;  
> The bankes are ouerflowen, when stopped is the flood.
>
> Therewith Sir *Guyon* left his first emprise,  
> And turning to that woman, fast her hent  
> By the hoare lockes, that hong before her eyes,  
> And to the ground her threw: yet n'ould she stent  
> Her bitter rayling and foule reuilement,  
> But still prouokt her sonne to wreake her wrong;  
> But nathelesse he did her still torment,  
> And catching hold of her vngratious tong,  
> Thereon an yron lock did fasten firme and strong.
>
> Then when as vse of speach was from her reft,  
> With her two crooked handes she signes did make,  
> And beckned him, the last helpe she had left:  
> But he that last left helpe away did take,  
> And both her hands fast bound vnto a stake,  
> That she note stirre. Then gan her sonne to flie  
> Full fast away, and did her quite forsake;  
> But *Guyon* after him in haste did hie,  
> And soone him ouertooke in sad perplexitie.
>
> In his strong armes he stiffely him embraste,  
> Who him gainstriuing, nought at all preuaild:  
> For all his power was vtterly defaste,  
> And furious fits at earst quite weren quaild:  
> Oft he re'nforst, and oft his forces fayld,  
> Yet yield he would not, nor his rancour slacke.  
> Then him to ground he cast, and rudely hayld,  
> And both his hands fast bound behind his backe,  
> And both his feet in fetters to an yron racke.
>
> With hundred yron chaines he did him bind,  
> And hundred knots that did him sore constraine:  
> Yet his great yron teeth he still did grind,  
> And grimly gnash, threatning reuenge in vaine:  
> His burning eyen, whom bloudie strakes did staine,  
> Stared full wide, and threw forth sparkes of fire,  
> And more for ranck despight, then for great paine,  
> Shakt his long lockes, colourd like copper-wire,  
> And bit his tawny beard to shew his raging ire.
>
> Thus when as *Guyon Furor* had captiu'd,  
> Turning about he saw that wretched Squire,  
> Whom that mad man of life nigh late depriu'd,  
> Lying on ground, all soild with bloud and mire:  
> Whom when as he perceiued to respire,  
> He gan to comfort, and his wounds to dresse.  
> Being at last recured, he gan inquire,  
> What hard mishap him brought to such distresse,  
> And made that caitiues thral, the thral of wretchednesse.
>
> With hart then throbbing, and with watry eyes,  
> Faire Sir (quoth he) what man can shun the hap,  
> That hidden lyes vnwares him to surpryse?  
> Misfortune waites aduantage to entrap  
> The man most warie in her whelming lap.  
> So me weake wretch, of many weakest one,  
> Vnweeting, and vnware of such mishap,  
> She brought to mischiefe through occasion,  
> Where this same wicked villein did me light vpon.
>
> It was a faithlesse Squire, that was the sourse  
> Of all my sorrow, and of these sad teares,  
> With whom from tender dug of commune nourse,  
> Attonce I was vpbrought, and eft when yeares  
> More rype vs reason lent to chose our Peares,  
> Our selues in league of vowed loue we knit:  
> In which we long time without gealous feares,  
> Or faultie thoughts continewd, as was fit;  
> And for my part I vow, dissembled not a whit.
>
> It was my fortune commune to that age,  
> To loue a Ladie faire of great degree,  
> The which was borne of noble parentage,  
> And set in highest seat of dignitee,  
> Yet seemd no lesse to loue, then loued to bee:  
> Long I her seru'd, and found her faithfull still,  
> Ne euer thing could cause vs disagree:  
> Loue that two harts makes one, makes eke one will:  
> Each stroue to please, and others pleasure to fulfill.
>
> My friend, hight *Philemon*, I did partake  
> Of all my loue and all my priuitie;  
> Who greatly ioyous seemed for my sake,  
> And gratious to that Ladie, as to mee,  
> Ne euer wight, that mote so welcome bee,  
> As he to her, withouten blot or blame,  
> Ne euer thing, that she could thinke or see,  
> But vnto him she would impart the same:  
> O wretched man, that would abuse so gentle Dame.
>
> At last such grace I found, and meanes I wrought,  
> That I that Ladie to my spouse had wonne;  
> Accord of friends, consent of parents sought,  
> Affiance made, my happinesse begonne,  
> There wanted nought but few rites to be donne,  
> Which mariage make; that day too farre did seeme:  
> Most ioyous man, on whom the shining Sunne,  
> Did shew his face, my selfe I did esteeme,  
> And that my falser friend did no lesse ioyous deeme.
>
> But ere that wished day his beame disclosd,  
> He either enuying my toward good,  
> Or of himselfe to treason ill disposd  
> One day vnto me came in friendly mood,  
> And told for secret how he vnderstood  
> That Ladie whom I had to me assynd,  
> Had both distaind her honorable blood,  
> And eke the faith, which she to me did bynd;  
> And therfore wisht me stay, till I more truth should fynd.
>
> The gnawing anguish and sharpe gelosy,  
> Which his sad speech infixed in my brest,  
> Ranckled so sore, and festred inwardly,  
> That my engreeued mind could find no rest,  
> Till that the truth thereof I did outwrest,  
> And him besought by that same sacred band  
> Betwixt vs both, to counsell me the best.  
> He then with solemne oath and plighted hand  
> Assur'd, ere long the truth to let me vnderstand.
>
> Ere long with like againe he boorded mee,  
> Saying, he now had boulted all the floure,  
> And that it was a groome of base degree,  
> Which of my loue was partner Paramoure:  
> Who vsed in a darksome inner bowre  
> Her oft to meet: which better to approue,  
> He promised to bring me at that howre,  
> When I should see, that would me nearer moue,  
> And driue me to withdraw my blind abused loue.
>
> This gracelesse man for furtherance of his guile,  
> Did court the handmayd of my Lady deare,  
> Who glad t'embosome his affection vile,  
> Did all she might, more pleasing to appeare.  
> One day to worke her to his will more neare,  
> He woo'd her thus: *Pryene* (so she hight)  
> What great despight doth fortune to thee beare,  
> Thus lowly to abase thy beautie bright,  
> That it should not deface all others lesser light?
>
> But if she had her least helpe to thee lent,  
> T'adorne thy forme according thy desart,  
> Their blazing pride thou wouldest soone haue blent,  
> And staynd their prayses with thy least good part;  
> Ne should faire *Claribell* with all her art,  
> Though she thy Lady be, approch thee neare;  
> For proofe thereof, this euening, as thou art,  
> Aray thy selfe in her most gorgeous geare,  
> That I may more delight in thy embracement deare.
>
> The Maidẽ proud through prayse, and mad through loue  
> Him hearkned to, and soone her selfe arayd,  
> The whiles to me the treachour did remoue  
> His craftie engin, and as he had sayd,  
> Me leading, in a secret corner layd,  
> The sad spectatour of my Tragedie;  
> Where left, he went, and his owne false part playd,  
> Disguised like that groome of base degree,  
> Whom he had feignd th'abuser of my loue to bee.
>
> Eftsoones he came vnto th'appointed place,  
> And with him brought *Priene*, rich arayd,  
> In *Claribellaes* clothes. Her proper face  
> I not descerned in that darkesome shade,  
> But weend it was my loue, with whom he playd.  
> Ah God, what horrour and tormenting griefe  
> My hart, my hands, mine eyes, and all assayd?  
> Me liefer were ten thousand deathes priefe,  
> Then wound of gealous worme, and shame of such repriefe.
>
> I home returning, fraught with fowle despight,  
> And chawing vengeance all the way I went,  
> Soone as my loathed loue appeard in sight,  
> With wrathfull hand I slew her innocent;  
> That after soone I dearely did lament:  
> For when the cause of that outrageous deede  
> Demaunded, I made plaine and euident,  
> Her faultie Handmayd, which that bale did breede,  
> Confest, how *Philemon* her wrought to chaunge her weede.
>
> Which when I heard, with horrible affright  
> And hellish fury all enragd, I sought  
> Vpon my selfe that vengeable despight  
> To punish: yet it better first I thought,  
> To wreake my wrath on him, that first it wrought.  
> To *Philemon*, false faytour *Philemon*  
> I cast to pay, that I so dearely bought;  
> Of deadly drugs I gaue him drinke anon,  
> And washt away his guilt with guiltie potion.
>
> Thus heaping crime on crime, and griefe on griefe,  
> To losse of loue adioyning losse of frend,  
> I meant to purge both with a third mischiefe,  
> And in my woes beginner it to end:  
> That was *Pryene*; she did first offend,  
> She last should smart: with which cruell intent,  
> When I at her my murdrous blade did bend,  
> She fled away with ghastly dreriment,  
> And I pursewing my fell purpose, after went.
>
> Feare gaue her wings, and rage enforst my flight;  
> Through woods and plaines so long I did her chace,  
> Till this mad man, whom your victorious might  
> Hath now fast bound, me met in middle space,  
> As I her, so he me pursewd apace,  
> And shortly ouertooke: I breathing yre,  
> Sore chauffed at my stay in such a cace,  
> And with my heat kindled his cruell fyre;  
> Which kindled once, his mother did more rage inspyre.
>
> Betwixt them both, they haue me doen to dye,  
> Through wounds, & strokes, & stubborne handeling,  
> That death were better, then such agony,  
> As griefe and furie vnto me did bring;  
> Of which in me yet stickes the mortall sting,  
> That during life will neuer be appeasd.  
> When he thus ended had his sorrowing,  
> Said *Guyon*, Squire, sore haue ye beene diseasd;  
> But all your hurts may soone through tẽperance be easd.
>
> Then gan the Palmer thus, most wretched man,  
> That to affections does the bridle lend;  
> In their beginning they are weake and wan,  
> But soone through suff'rance grow to fearefull end;  
> Whiles they are weake betimes with them contend:  
> For when they once to perfect strength do grow,  
> Strong warres they make, and cruell battry bend  
> Gainst fort of Reason, it to ouerthrow:  
> Wrath, gelosie, griefe, loue this Squire haue layd thus low.
>
> Wrath, gealosie, griefe, loue do thus expell:  
> Wrath is a fire, and gealosie a weede,  
> Griefe is a flood, and loue a monster fell;  
> The fire of sparkes, the weede of little seede,  
> The flood of drops, the Monster filth did breede:  
> But sparks, seed, drops, and filth do thus delay;  
> The sparks soone quench, the springing seed outweed,  
> The drops dry vp, and filth wipe cleane away:  
> So shall wrath, gealosie, griefe, loue dye and decay.
>
> Vnlucky Squire (said *Guyon*) sith thou hast  
> Falne into mischiefe through intemperaunce,  
> Henceforth take heede of that thou now hast past,  
> And guide thy wayes with warie gouernaunce,  
> Least worse betide thee by some later chaunce.  
> But read how art thou nam'd, and of what kin.  
> *Phedon* I hight (quoth he) and do aduaunce  
> Mine auncestry from famous *Coradin*,  
> Who first to rayse our house to honour did begin.
>
> Thus as he spake, lo far away they spyde  
> A varlet running towards hastily,  
> Whose flying feet so fast their way applyde,  
> That round about a cloud of dust did fly,  
> Which mingled all with sweate, did dim his eye.  
> He soone approched, panting, breathlesse, whot,  
> And all so soyld, that none could him descry;  
> His countenaunce was bold, and bashed not  
> For *Guyons* lookes, but scornefull eyglaunce at him shot.
>
> Behind his backe he bore a brasen shield,  
> On which was drawen faire, in colours fit,  
> A flaming fire in midst of bloudy field,  
> And round about the wreath this word was writ,  
> *Burnt I do burne.* Right well beseemed it,  
> To be the shield of some redoubted knight;  
> And in his hand two darts exceeding flit,  
> And deadly sharpe he held, whose heads were dight  
> In poyson and in bloud, of malice and despight.
>
> When he in presence came, to *Guyon* first  
> He boldly spake, Sir knight, if knight thou bee,  
> Abandon this forestalled place at erst,  
> For feare of further harme, I counsell thee,  
> Or bide the chaunce at thine owne ieoperdie.  
> The knight at his great boldnesse wondered,  
> And though he scornd his idle vanitie,  
> Yet mildly him to purpose answered;  
> For not to grow of nought he it coniectured.
>
> Varlet, this place most dew to me I deeme,  
> Yielded by him, that held it forcibly.  
> But whence should come that harme, which thou doest seeme  
> To threat to him, that minds his chaunce t'abye?  
> Perdy (said he) here comes, and is hard by  
> A knight of wondrous powre, and great assay,  
> That neuer yet encountred enemy,  
> But did him deadly daunt, or fowle dismay;  
> Ne thou for better hope, if thou his presence stay.
>
> How hight he then (said *Guyon*) and from whence?  
> *Pyrrhochles* is his name, renowmed farre  
> For his bold feats and hardy confidence,  
> Full oft approu'd in many a cruell warre,  
> The brother of *Cymochles*, both which arre  
> The sonnes of old *Acrates* and *Despight*,  
> *Acrates* sonne of *Phlegeton* and *Iarre*;  
> But *Phlegeton* is sonne of *Herebus* and *Night*;  
> But *Herebus* sonne of *Aeternitie* is hight.
>
> So from immortall race he does proceede,  
> That mortall hands may not withstand his might,  
> Drad for his derring do, and bloudy deed;  
> For all in bloud and spoile is his delight.  
> His am I *Atin*, his in wrong and right,  
> That matter make for him to worke vpon,  
> And stirre him vp to strife and cruell fight.  
> Fly therefore, fly this fearefull stead anon,  
> Least thy foolhardize worke thy sad confusion.
>
> His be that care, whom most it doth concerne,  
> (Said he) but whither with such hasty flight  
> Art thou now bound? for well mote I discerne  
> Great cause, that carries thee so swift and light.  
> My Lord (quoth he) me sent, and streight behight  
> To seeke *Occasion*, where so she bee:  
> For he is all disposd to bloudy fight,  
> And breathes out wrath and hainous crueltie;  
> Hard is his hap, that first fals in his ieopardie.
>
> Madman (said then the Palmer) that does seeke  
> *Occasion* to wrath, and cause of strife;  
> She comes vnsought, and shonned followes eke.  
> Happy, who can abstaine, when Rancour rife  
> Kindles Reuenge, and threats his rusty knife;  
> Woe neuer wants, where euery cause is caught,  
> And rash *Occasion* makes vnquiet life.  
> Then loe, where bound she sits, whõ thou hast sought,  
> (Said *Guyon*,) let that message to thy Lord be brought.
>
> That when the varlet heard and saw, streight way  
> He wexed wondrous wroth, and said, Vile knight,  
> That knights & knighthood doest with shame vpbray,  
> And shewst th'ensãple of thy childish might,  
> With silly weake old woman thus to fight.  
> Great glory and gay spoile sure hast thou got,  
> And stoutly prou'd thy puissaunce here in sight;  
> That shall *Pyrrochles* well requite, I wot,  
> And with thy bloud abolish so reprochfull blot.
>
> With that one of his thrillant darts he threw,  
> Headed with ire and vengeable despight;  
> The quiuering steele his aymed end well knew,  
> And to his brest it selfe intended right:  
> But he was warie, and ere it empight  
> In the meant marke, aduaunst his shield atweene,  
> On which it seizing, no way enter might,  
> But backe rebounding, left the forckhead keene;  
> Eftsoones he fled away, and might no where be seene.
