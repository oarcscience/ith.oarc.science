<blockquote> 
<i>Marinells former wound is heald,<br>
he comes to Proteus hall,<br>
Where Thames doth the Medway wedd,<br>
and feasts the Sea-gods all.</i><p>

B
Vt ah for pittie that I haue thus long<br>
Left a fayre Ladie languishing in payne:<br>
Now well away, that I haue doen such wrong,<br>
To let faire <i>Florimell</i> in bands remayne,<br>
In bands of loue, and in sad thraldomes chayne;<br>
From which vnlesse some heauenly powre her free<br>
By miracle, not yet appearing playne,<br>
She lenger yet is like captiu'd to bee:<br>
That euen to thinke thereof, it inly pitties mee.<p>

Here neede you to remember, how erewhile<br>
Vnlouely <i>Proteus</i>, missing to his mind<br>
That Virgins loue to win by wit or wile,<br>
Her threw into a dongeon deepe and blind,<br>
And there in chaynes her cruelly did bind,<br>
In hope thereby her to his bent to draw:<br>
For when as neither gifts nor graces kind<br>
Her constant mind could moue at all he saw,<br>
He thought her to compell by crueltie and awe.<p>

Deepe in the bottome of an huge great rocke<br>
The dongeon was, in which her bound he left,<br>
That neither yron barres, nor brasen locke<br>
Did neede to gard from force, or secret theft<br>
Of all her louers, which would her haue reft.<br>
For wall'd it was with waues, which rag'd and ror'd<br>
As they the cliffe in peeces would haue cleft;<br>
Besides ten thousand monsters foule abhor'd<br>
Did waite about it, gaping griesly all begor'd.<p>

And in the midst thereof did horror dwell,<br>
And darkenesse dredd, that neuer viewed day,<br>
Like to the balefull house of lowest hell,<br>
In which old <i>Styx</i> her aged bones alway,<br>
Old <i>Styx</i> the Grandame of the Gods, doth lay.<br>
There did this lucklesse mayd seuen months abide,<br>
Ne euer euening saw, ne mornings ray,<br>
Ne euer from the day the night descride,<br>
But thought it all one night, that did no houres diuide.<p>

And all this was for loue of <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
Who her despysd (ah who would her despyse?)<br>
And wemens loue did from his hart expell,<br>
And all those ioyes that weake mankind entyse.<br>
Nathlesse his pride full dearely he did pryse;<br>
For of a womans hand it was ywroke,<br>
That of the wound he yet in languor lyes,<br>
Ne can be cured of that cruell stroke<br>
Which <i>Britomart</i> him gaue, when he did her prouoke.<p>

Yet farre and neare the Nymph his mother sought,<br>
And many salues did to his sore applie,<br>
And many herbes did vse.  But when as nought<br>
She saw could ease his rankling maladie,<br>
At last to <i>Tryphon</i> she for helpe did hie,<br>
(This <i>Tryphon</i> is the seagods surgeon hight)<br>
Whom she besought to find some remedie:<br>
And for his paines a whistle him behight<br>
That of a fishes shell was wrought with rare delight.<p>

So well that Leach did hearke to her request,<br>
And did so well employ his carefull paine,<br>
That in short space his hurts he had redrest,<br>
And him restor'd to healthfull state againe:<br>
In which he long time after did remaine<br>
There with the Nymph his mother, like her thrall;<br>
Who sore against his will did him retaine,<br>
For feare of perill, which to him mote fall,<br>
Through his too ventrous prowesse proued ouer all.<p>

It fortun'd then, a solemne feast was there<br>
To all the Sea-gods and their fruitfull seede,<br>
In honour of the spousalls, which then were<br>
Betwixt the <i>Medway</i> and the <i>Thames</i> agreed.<br>
Long had the <i>Thames</i> (as we in records reed)<br>
Before that day her wooed to his bed;<br>
But the proud Nymph would for no worldly meed,<br>
Nor no entreatie to his loue be led;<br>
Till now at last relenting, she to him was wed.<p>

So both agreed, that this their bridale feast<br>
Should for the Gods in <i>Proteus</i> house be made;<br>
To which they all repayr'd, both most and least,<br>
Aswell which in the mightie Ocean trade,<br>
As that in riuers swim, or brookes doe wade.<br>
All which not if an hundred tongues to tell,<br>
And hundred mouthes, and voice of brasse I had,<br>
And endlesse memorie, that mote excell,<br>
In order as they came, could I recount them well.<p>

Helpe therefore, O thou sacred imp of <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
The noursling of Dame <i>Memorie</i> his deare,<br>
To whom those rolles, layd vp in heauen aboue,<br>
And records of antiquitie appeare,<br>
To which no wit of man may comen neare;<br>
Helpe me to tell the names of all those floods,<br>
And all those Nymphes, which then assembled were<br>
To that great banquet of the watry Gods,<br>
And all their sundry kinds, and all their hid abodes.<p>

First came great <i>Neptune</i> with his threeforkt mace,<br>
That rules the Seas, and makes them rise or fall;<br>
His dewy lockes did drop with brine apace,<br>
Vnder his Diademe imperiall:<br>
And by his side his Queene with coronall,<br>
Faire <i>Amphitrite</i>, most diuinely faire,<br>
Whose yuorie shoulders weren couered all,<br>
As with a robe, with her owne siluer haire,<br>
And deckt with pearles, which th'Indian seas for her prepaire.<p>

These marched farre afore the other crew;<br>
And all the way before them as they went,<br>
<i>Triton</i> his trompet shrill before them blew,<br>
For goodly triumph and great iollyment,<br>
That made the rockes to roare, as they were rent.<br>
And after them the royall issue came,<br>
Which of them sprung by lineall descent:<br>
First the Sea-gods, which to themselues doe clame<br>
The powre to rule the billowes, and the waues to tame.<p>

<i>Phorcys</i>, the father of that fatall brood,<br>
By whom those old Heroes wonne such fame;<br>
And <i>Glaucus</i>, that wise southsayes vnderstood;<br>
And tragicke <i>Inoes</i> sonne, the which became<br>
A God of seas through his mad mothers blame,<br>
Now hight <i>Palemon</i>, and is saylers frend;<br>
Great <i>Brontes</i>, and <i>Astraeus</i>, that did shame<br>
Himselfe with incest of his kin vnkend;<br>
And huge <i>Orion</i>, that doth tempests still portend.<p>

The rich <i>Cteatus</i>, and <i>Eurytus</i> long;<br>
<i>Neleus</i> and <i>Pelias</i> louely brethren both;<br>
Mightie <i>Chrysaor</i>, and <i>Caicus</i> strong;<br>
<i>Eurypulus</i>, that calmes the waters wroth;<br>
And faire <i>Euphaemus</i>, that vpon them go'th<br>
As on the ground, without dismay or dread:<br>
Fierce <i>Eryx</i>, and <i>Alebius</i> that know'th<br>
The waters depth, and doth their bottome tread;<br>
And sad <i>Asopus</i>, comely with his hoarie head.<p>

There also some most famous founders were<br>
Of puissant Nations, which the world possest;<br>
Yet sonnes of <i>Neptune</i>, now assembled here:<br>
Ancient <i>Ogyges</i>, even th'auncientest,<br>
And <i>Inachus</i> renowmd aboue the rest;<br>
<i>Phoenix</i>, and <i>Aon</i>, and <i>Pelasgus</i> old,<br>
Great <i>Belus</i>, <i>Phoeax</i>, and <i>Agenor</i> best;<br>
And mightie <i>Albion</i>, father of the bold<br>
And warlike people, which the <i>Britaine</i> Islands hold.<p>

For <i>Albion</i> the sonne of <i>Neptune</i> was,<br>
Who for the proofe of his great puissance,<br>
Out of his <i>Albion</i> did on dry-foot pas<br>
Into old <i>Gall</i>, that now is cleeped <i>France</i>,<br>
To fight with <i>Hercules</i>, that did aduance<br>
To vanquish all the world with matchlesse might,<br>
And there his mortall part by great mischance<br>
Was slaine: but that which is th'immortall spright<br>
Liues still: and to this feast with <i>Neptunes</i> seed was dight.<p>

But what doe I their names seeke to reherse,<br>
Which all the world haue with their issue fild?<br>
How can they all in this so narrow verse<br>
Contayned be, and in small compasse hild?<br>
Let them record them, that are better skild,<br>
And know the moniments of passed times:<br>
Onely what needeth, shall be here fulfild,<br>
T'expresse some part of that great equipage,<br>
Which from great <i>Neptune</i> do deriue their parentage.<p>

Next came the aged <i>Ocean</i>, and his Dame,<br>
Old <i>Tethys</i>, th'oldest two of all the rest,<br>
For all the rest of those two parents came,<br>
Which afterward both sea and land possest:<br>
Of all which <i>Nereus</i> th'eldest, and the best,<br>
Did first proceed, then which none more vpright,<br>
Ne more sincere in word and deed profest;<br>
Most voide of guile, most free from fowle despight,<br>
Doing him selfe, and teaching others to doe right.<p>

Thereto he was expert in prophecies,<br>
And could the ledden of the Gods vnfold,<br>
Through which, when <i>Paris</i> brought his famous prise<br>
The faire Tindarid lasse, he him fortold,<br>
That her all <i>Greece</i> with many a champion bold<br>
Should fetch againe, and finally destroy<br>
Proud <i>Priams</i> towne. So wise is <i>Nereus</i> old,<br>
And so well skild; nathlesse he takes great ioy<br>
Oft-times am&otilde;gst the wanton Nymphs to sport and toy.<p>

And after him the famous riuers came,<br>
Which doe the earth enrich and beautifie:<br>
The fertile Nile, which creatures new doth frame;<br>
Long Rhodanus, whose sourse springs from the skie;<br>
Faire Ister, flowing from the mountaines hie;<br>
Diuine Scamander, purpled yet with blood<br>
Of Greekes and Troians, which therein did die;<br>
Pactolus glistring with his golden flood,<br>
And Tygris fierce, whose streames of none may be withstood.<p>

Great Ganges, and immortall Euphrates,<br>
Deepe Indus, and Maeander intricate,<br>
Slow Peneus, and tempestuous Phasides,<br>
Swift Rhene, and Alpheus still immaculate:<br>
Ooraxes, feared for great <i>Cyrus</i> fate;<br>
Tybris, renowmed for the Romaines fame,<br>
Rich Oranochy, though but knowen late;<br>
And that huge Riuer, which doth beare his name<br>
Of warlike Amazons, which doe possesse the same.<p>

Ioy on those warlike women, which so long<br>
Can from all men so rich a kingdome hold;<br>
And shame on you, &ocirc; men, which boast your strong<br>
And valiant hearts, in thoughts lesse hard and bold,<br>
Yet quaile in conquest of that land of gold.<br>
But this to you, &ocirc; Britons, most pertaines,<br>
To whom the right hereof it selfe hath sold;<br>
The which for sparing litle cost or paines,<br>
Loose so immortall glory, and so endlesse gaines.<p>

Then was there heard a most celestiall sound,<br>
Of dainty musicke, which did next ensew<br>
Before the spouse: that was <i>Arion</i> crownd;<br>
Who playing on his harpe, vnto him drew<br>
The eares and hearts of all that goodly crew,<br>
That euen yet the Dolphin, which him bore<br>
Through the AEgaean seas from Pirates vew,<br>
Stood still by him astonisht at his lore,<br>
And all the raging seas for ioy forgot to rore.<p>

So went he playing on the watery plaine.<br>
Soone after whom the louely Bridegroome came,<br>
The noble Thamis, with all his goodly traine,<br>
But him before there went, as best became<br>
His auncient parents, namely th'auncient Thame.<br>
But much more aged was his wife then he,<br>
The Ouze, whom men doe Isis rightly name;<br>
Full weake and crooked creature seemed she,<br>
And almost blind through eld, that scarce her way could see.<p>

Therefore on either side she was sustained<br>
Of two smal grooms, which by their names were hight<br>
The <i>Churne</i>, and <i>Charwell</i>, two small streames, which pained<br>
Them selues her footing to direct aright,<br>
Which fayled oft through faint and feeble plight:<br>
But <i>Thame</i> was stronger, and of better stay;<br>
Yet seem'd full aged by his outward sight,<br>
With head all hoary, and his beard all gray,<br>
Deawed with siluer drops, that trickled downe alway.<p>

And eke he somewhat seem'd to stoupe afore<br>
With bowed backe, by reason of the lode,<br>
And auncient heauy burden, which he bore<br>
Of that faire City, wherein make abode<br>
So many learned impes, that shoote abrode,<br>
And with their braunches spred all Britany,<br>
No lesse then do her elder sisters broode.<br>
Ioy to you both, ye double noursery<br>
Or Arts, but Oxford thine doth <i>Thame</i> most glorify.<p>

But he their sonne full fresh and iolly was,<br>
All decked in a robe of watchet hew,<br>
On which the waues, glittering like Christall glas,<br>
So cunningly enwouen were, that few<br>
Could weenen, whether they were false or trew.<br>
And on his head like to a Coronet<br>
He wore, that seemed strange to common vew,<br>
In which were many towres and castels set,<br>
That it encompast round as with a golden fret.<p>

Like as the mother of the Gods, they say,<br>
In her great iron charet wonts to ride,<br>
When to <i>Ioues</i> pallace she doth take her way;<br>
Old <i>Cybele</i>, arayd with pompous pride,<br>
Wearing a Diademe embattild wide<br>
With hundred turrets, like a Turribant.<br>
With such an one was Thamis beautifide;<br>
That was to weet the famous Troynouant,<br>
In which her kingdomes throne is chiefly resiant.<p>

And round about him many a pretty Page<br>
Attended duely, ready to obay;<br>
All little Riuers, which owe vassallage<br>
To him, as to their Lord, and tribute pay:<br>
The chaulky Kenet, and the Thetis gray,<br>
The morish Cole, and the soft sliding Breane,<br>
The wanton Lee, that oft doth loose his way,<br>
And the still Darent, in whose waters cleane<br>
Ten thousand fishes play, and decke his pleasant streame.<p>

Then came his neighbour flouds, which nigh him dwell,<br>
And water all the English soile throughout;<br>
They all on him this day attended well;<br>
And with meet seruice waited him about;<br>
Ne none disdained low to him to lout:<br>
No not the stately Seuerne grudg'd at all,<br>
Ne storming Humber, though he looked stout;<br>
But both him honor'd as their principall,<br>
And let their swelling waters low before him fall.<p>

There was the speedy Tamar, which deuides<br>
The Cornish and the Deuonish confines;<br>
Through both whose borders swiftly downe it glides,<br>
And meeting Plim, to Plimmouth thence declines:<br>
And Dart, nigh chockt with sands of tinny mines.<br>
But Auon marched in more stately path,<br>
Proud of his Adamants, with which he shines<br>
And glisters wide, as als' of wondrous Bath,<br>
And Bristow faire, which on his waues he builded hath.<p>

And there came Stoure with terrible aspect,<br>
Bearing his sixe deformed heads on hye,<br>
That doth his course through Blandford plains direct,<br>
And washeth Winborne meades in season drye.<br>
Next him went Wylibourne with passage slye,<br>
That of his wylinesse his name doth take,<br>
And of him selfe doth name the shire thereby;<br>
And Mole, that like a nousling Mole doth make<br>
His way still vnder ground, till Thamis he ouertake.<p>

Then came the Rother, decked all with woods<br>
Like a wood God, and flowing fast to Rhy:<br>
And Sture, that parteth with his pleasant floods<br>
The Easterne Saxons from the Southerne ny,<br>
And Clare, and Harwitch both doth beautify:<br>
Him follow'd Yar, soft washing Norwitch wall,<br>
And with him brought a present ioyfully<br>
Of his owne fish vnto their festiuall,<br>
Whose like none else could shew, the which they Ruffins call.<p>

Next these the plenteous Ouse came far from land,<br>
By many a city, and by many a towne,<br>
And many riuers taking vnder hand<br>
Into his waters, as he passeth downe,<br>
The Cle, the Were, the Grant, the Sture, the Rowne.<br>
Thence doth by Huntingdon and Cambridge flit;<br>
My mother Cambridge, whom as with a Crowne<br>
He doth adorne, and is adorn'd of it<br>
With many a gentle Muse, and many a learned wit.<p>

And after him the fatall Welland went,<br>
That if old sawes proue true (which God forbid)<br>
Shall drowne all Holland with his excrement,<br>
And shall see Stamford, though now homely hid,<br>
Then shine in learning, more then euer did<br>
Cambridge or Oxford, Englands goodly beames.<br>
And next to him the <i>Nene</i> downe softly slid;<br>
And bounteous Trent, that in him selfe enseames<br>
Both thirty sorts of fish, and thirty sundry streames.<p>

Next these came Tyne, along whose stony bancke<br>
That Romaine Monarch built a brasen wall,<br>
Which mote the feebled Britons strongly flancke<br>
Against the Picts, that swarmed ouer all,<br>
Which yet thereof Gualseuer they doe call:<br>
And Twede the limit betwixt Logris land<br>
And Albany: And Eden though but small,<br>
Yet often stainde with bloud of many a band<br>
Of Scots and English both, that tyned on his strand.<p>

Then came those sixe sad brethren, like forlorne,<br>
That whilome were (as antique fathers tell)<br>
Sixe valiant Knights, of one faire Nymphe yborne,<br>
Which did in noble deedes of armes excell,<br>
And wonned there, where now Yorke people dwell;<br>
Still Vre, swift Werfe, and Oze the most of might,<br>
High Swale, vnquiet Nide, and troublous Skell;<br>
All whom a Scythian king, that Humber hight,<br>
Slew cruelly, and in the riuer drowned quight.<p>

But past not long, ere <i>Brutus</i> warlicke sonne<br>
<i>Locrinus</i> them aueng'd, and the same date,<br>
Which the proud Humber vnto them had donne,<br>
By equall dome repayd on his owne pate:<br>
For in the selfe same riuer, where he late<br>
Had drenched them, he drowned him againe;<br>
And nam'd the riuer of his wretched fate;<br>
Whose bad condition yet it doth retaine,<br>
Oft tossed with his stormes, which therein still remaine.<p>

These after, came the stony shallow Lone,<br>
That to old Loncaster his name doth lend;<br>
And following Dee, which Britons long ygone<br>
Did call diuine, that doth by Chester tend;<br>
And Conway which out of his streame doth send<br>
Plenty of pearles to decke his dames withall,<br>
And Lindus that his pikes doth most commend,<br>
Of which the auncient Lincolne men doe call;<br>
All these together marched toward <i>Proteus</i> hall.<p>

Ne thence the Irishe Riuers absent were:<br>
Sith no lesse famous then the rest they bee,<br>
And ioyne in neighbourhood of kingdome nere,<br>
Why should they not likewise in loue agree,<br>
And ioy likewise this solemne day to see?<br>
They saw it all, and present were in place;<br>
Though I them all according their degree,<br>
Cannot recount, nor tell their hidden race,<br>
Nor read the saluage c&utilds;treis, thorough which they pace.<p>

There was the Liffy rolling downe the lea,<br>
The sandy Slane, the stony Aubrian,<br>
The spacious Shenan spreading like a sea,<br>
The pleasant Boyne, the fishy fruitfull Ban,<br>
Swift Awniduff, which of the English man<br>
Is cal'de Blacke water, and the Liffar deep,<br>
Sad Trowis, that once his people ouerran,<br>
Strong Allo tombling from Slewlogher steep,<br>
And Mulla mine, whose waues I whilom taught to weep.<p>

And there the three renowmed brethren were,<br>
Which that great Gyant <i>Blomius</i> begot,<br>
Of the faire Nimph <i>Rheusa</i> wandring there.<br>
One day, as she to shunne the season whot,<br>
Vnder Slewbloome in shady groue was got,<br>
This Gyant found her, and by force deflowr'd:<br>
Whereof conceiuing, she in time forth brought<br>
These three faire sons, which being th&#7869;ce forth powrd<br>
In three great riuers ran, and many countreis scowrd.<p>

The first, the gentle Shure that making way<br>
By sweet Clonmell, adornes rich Waterford;<br>
The next, the stubborne Newre, whose waters gray<br>
By faire Kilkenny and Rosseponte boord,<br>
The third, the goodly Barow, which doth hoord<br>
Great heapes of Salmons in his deepe bosome:<br>
All which long sundred, doe at last accord<br>
To ioyne in one, ere to the sea they come,<br>
So flowing all from one, all one at last become.<p>

There also was the wide embayed Mayre,<br>
The pleasaunt Bandon crownd with many a wood,<br>
The spreading Lee, that like an Island fayre<br>
Encloseth Corke with his deuided flood;<br>
And balefull Oure, late staind with English blood:<br>
With many more, whose names no tongue can tell.<br>
All which that day in order seemly good<br>
Did on the Thamis attend, and waited well<br>
To doe their duefull seruice, as to them befell.<p>

Then came the Bride, the louely <i>Medua</i> came,<br>
Clad in a vesture of vnknowen geare,<br>
And vncouth fashion, yet her well became;<br>
That seem'd like siluer, sprinckled here and theare<br>
With glittering spangs, that did like starres appeare,<br>
And wau'd vpon, like water Chamelot,<br>
To hide the metall, which yet euery where<br>
Bewrayd it selfe, to let men plainely wot,<br>
It was no mortall worke, that seem'd and yet was not.<p>

Her goodly lockes adowne her backe did flow<br>
Vnto her waste, with flowres bescattered,<br>
The which ambrosiall odours forth did throw<br>
To all about, and all her shoulders spred<br>
As a new spring; and likewise on her hed<br>
A Chapelet of sundry flowers she wore,<br>
From vnder which the deawy humour shed,<br>
Did tricle downe her haire, like to the hore<br>
Congealed litle drops, which doe the morne adore.<p>

On her two pretty handmaides did attend,<br>
One cald the <i>Theise</i>, the other cald the <i>Crane</i>;<br>
Which on her waited, things amisse to mend,<br>
And both behind vpheld her spredding traine;<br>
Vnder the which, her feet appeared plaine,<br>
Her siluer feet, faire washt against this day:<br>
And her before there paced Pages twaine,<br>
Both clad in colours like, and like array,<br>
The <i>Doune</i> &amp; eke the <i>Frith</i>, both which prepard her way.<p>

And after these the Sea Nymphs marched all,<br>
All goodly damzels, deckt with long greene haire,<br>
Whom of their sire <i>Nereides</i> men call,<br>
All which the Oceans daughter to him bare<br>
The gray eyde <i>Doris</i>: all which fifty are;<br>
All which she there on her attending had.<br>
Swift <i>Proto</i>, milde <i>Eucrate</i>, <i>Thetis</i> faire,<br>
Soft <i>Spio</i>, sweete <i>Eudore</i>, <i>Sao</i> sad,<br>
Light <i>Doto</i>, wanton <i>Glauce</i>, and <i>Galene</i> glad.<p>

White hand <i>Eunica</i>, proud <i>Dynamene</i>,<br>
Ioyous <i>Thalia</i>, goodly <i>Amphitrite</i>,<br>
Louely <i>Pasithee</i>, kinde <i>Eulimene</i>,<br>
Lifht goote <i>Cymothoe</i>, and sweete <i>Melite</i>,<br>
Fairest <i>Pherusa</i>, <i>Phao</i> lilly white,<br>
Wondred <i>Agaue</i>, <i>Poris</i>, and <i>Nes&aelig;a</i>,<br>
With <i>Erato</i> that doth in loue delite,<br>
And <i>Panop&aelig;</i>, and wise <i>Protomed&aelig;a</i>,<br>
And snowy neckd <i>Doris</i>, and milkewhite <i>Galath&aelig;a</i>.<p>

Speedy <i>Hippothoe</i>, and chaste <i>Actea</i>,<br>
Large <i>Lisianassa</i>, and <i>Pron&aelig;a</i> sage,<br>
<i>Euagore</i>, and light <i>Pontoporea</i>,<br>
And she, that with her least word can asswage<br>
The surging seas, when they do sorest rage,<br>
<i>Cymodoce</i>, and stout <i>Autonoe</i>,<br>
And <i>Neso</i>, and <i>Eione</i> well in age,<br>
And seeming still to smile, <i>Glauconome</i>,<br>
And she that hight of many heastes <i>Polynome</i>,<p>

Fresh <i>Alimeda</i>, deckt with girlond greene;<br>
<i>Hyponeo</i>, with salt bedewed wrests:<br>
<i>Laomedia</i>, like the christall sheene;<br>
<i>Liagore</i>, much praisd for wise behests;<br>
And <i>Psamathe</i>, for her brode snowy brests;<br>
<i>Cymo</i>, <i>Eupompe</i>, and <i>Themiste</i> iust;<br>
And she that vertue loues and vice detests<br>
<i>Euarna</i>, and <i>Menippe</i> true in trust,<br>
And <i>Nemertea</i> learned well to rule her lust.<p>

All these the daughters of old <i>Nereus</i> were,<br>
Which haue the sea in charge to them assinde,<br>
To rule his tides, and surges to vprere,<br>
To bring forth stormes, or fast them to vpbinde,<br>
And sailers saue from wreckes of wrathfull winde.<br>
And yet besides three thousand more there were<br>
Of th'Oceans seede, but <i>Ioues</i> and <i>Phoebus</i> kinde;<br>
The which in floods and fountaines doe appere,<br>
And all mankinde do nourish with their waters clere.<p>

The which, more eath it were for mortall wight,<br>
To tell the sands, or count the starres on hye,<br>
Or ought more hard, then thinke to reckon right.<br>
But well I wote, that these which I descry,<br>
