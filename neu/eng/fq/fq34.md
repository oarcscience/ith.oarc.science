*Cant. VIII.*

> *The Witch creates a snowy Lady,  
> Like to Florimell,  
> Who wrongd by Carle by Proteus sau'd,  
> Is sought by Paridell.*

> S O oft as I this history record,  
> My hart doth melt with meere compassion,  
> To thinke, how causelesse of her owne accord  
> This gentle Damzell, whom I wrote vpon,  
> Should plonged be in such affliction,  
> Without all hope of comfort or reliefe,  
> That sure I weene, the hardest hart of stone,  
> Would hardly find to aggrauate her griefe;  
> For misery craues rather mercie, then repriefe.
>
> But that accursed Hag, her hostesse late,  
> Had so enranckled her malitious hart,  
> That she desyrd th'abridgement of her fate,  
> Or long enlargement of her painefull smart.  
> Now when the Beast, which by her wicked art  
> Late forth she sent, she backe returning spyde,  
> Tyde with her broken girdle, it a part  
> Of her rich spoyles, whom he had earst destroyd,  
> She weend, and wondrous gladnesse to her hart applyde.
>
> And with it running hast'ly to her sonne,  
> Thought with that sight him much to haue reliued;  
> Who thereby deeming sure the thing as donne,  
> His former griefe with furie fresh reuiued,  
> Much more then earst, and would haue algates riued  
> The hart out of his brest: for sith her ded  
> He surely dempt, himselfe he thought depriued  
> Quite of all hope, wherewith he long had fed  
> His foolish maladie, and long time had misled.
>
> With thought whereof, exceeding mad he grew,  
> And in his rage his mother would haue slaine,  
> Had she not fled into a secret mew,  
> Where she was wont her Sprights to entertaine  
> The maisters of her art: there was she faine  
> To call them all in order to her ayde,  
> And them coniure vpon eternall paine,  
> To counsell her so carefully dismayd,  
> How she might heale her sonne, whose senses were decayd.
>
> By their aduise, and her owne wicked wit,  
> She there deuiz'd a wondrous worke to frame,  
> Whose like on earth was neuer framed yit,  
> That euen Nature selfe enuide the same,  
> And grudg'd to see the counterfet should shame  
> The thing it selfe. In hand she boldly tooke  
> To make another like the former Dame,  
> Another *Florimell*, in shape and looke  
> So liuely and so like, that many it mistooke.
>
> The substance, whereof she the bodie made,  
> Was purest snow in massie mould congeald,  
> Which she had gathered in a shadie glade  
> Of the *Riphoean* hils, to her reueald  
> By errant Sprights, but from all men conceald:  
> The same she tempred with fine Mercury,  
> And virgin wex, that neuer yet was seald,  
> And mingled them with perfect vermily,  
> That like a liuely sanguine it seem'd to the eye.
>
> In stead of eyes two burning lampes she set  
> In siluer sockets, shyning like the skyes,  
> And a quicke mouing Spirit did arret  
> To stirre and roll them, like a womans eyes;  
> In stead of yellow lockes she did deuise,  
> With golden wyre to weaue her curled head;  
> Yet golden wyre was not so yellow thrise  
> As *Florimells* faire haire: and in the stead  
> Of life, she put a Spright to rule the carkasse dead.
>
> A wicked Spright yfraught with fawning guile,  
> And faire resemblance aboue all the rest,  
> Which with the Prince of Darknesse fell somewhile,  
> From heauens blisse and euerlasting rest;  
> Him needed not instruct, which way were best  
> Himselfe to fashion likest *Florimell*,  
> Ne how to speake, ne how to vse his gest,  
> For he in counterfeisance did excell,  
> And all the wyles of wemens wits knew passing well.
>
> Him shaped thus, she deckt in garments gay,  
> Which *Florimell* had left behind her late,  
> That who so then her saw, would surely say,  
> It was her selfe, whom it did imitate,  
> Or fairer then her selfe, if ought algate  
> Might fairer be. And then she forth her brought  
> Vnto her sonne, that lay in feeble state;  
> Who seeing her gan streight vpstart, and thought  
> She was the Lady selfe, whom he so long had sought.
>
> Tho fast her clipping twixt his armes twaine,  
> Extremely ioyed in so happie sight,  
> And soone forgot his former sickly paine;  
> But she, the more to seeme such as she hight,  
> Coyly rebutted his embracement light;  
> Yet still with gentle countenaunce retained,  
> Enough to hold a foole in vaine delight:  
> Him long she so with shadowes entertained,  
> As her Creatresse had in charge to her ordained.
>
> Till on a day, as he disposed was  
> To walke the woods with that his Idole faire,  
> Her to disport, and idle time to pas,  
> In th'open freshnesse of the gentle aire,  
> A knight that way there chaunced to repaire;  
> Yet knight he was not, but a boastfull swaine,  
> That deedes of armes had euer in despaire,  
> Proud *Braggadocchio*, that in vaunting vaine  
> His glory did repose, and credit did maintaine.
>
> He seeing with that Chorle so faire a wight,  
> Decked with many a costly ornament,  
> Much merueiled thereat, as well he might,  
> And thought that match a fowle disparagement:  
> His bloudie speare eftsoones he boldly bent  
> Against the silly clowne, who dead through feare,  
> Fell streight to ground in great astonishment;  
> Villein (said he) this Ladie is my deare,  
> Dy, if thou it gainesay: I will away her beare.
>
> The fearefull Chorle durst not gainesay, nor doe,  
> But trembling stood, and yielded him the pray;  
> Who finding litle leasure her to wooe,  
> On *Tromparts* steed her mounted without stay,  
> And without reskew led her quite away.  
> Proud man himselfe then *Braggadocchio* deemed,  
> And next to none, after that happie day,  
> Being possessed of that spoyle, which seemed  
> The fairest wight on ground, and most of men esteemed.
>
> But when he saw himselfe free from poursute,  
> He gan make gentle purpose to his Dame,  
> With termes of loue and lewdnesse dissolute;  
> For he could well his glozing speaches frame  
> To such vaine vses, that him best became:  
> But she thereto would lend but light regard,  
> As seeming sory, that she euer came  
> Into his powre, that vsed her so hard,  
> To reaue her honor, which she more then life prefard.
>
> Thus as they two of kindnesse treated long,  
> There them by chaunce encountred on the way  
> An armed knight, vpon a courser strong,  
> Whose trampling feet vpon the hollow lay  
> Seemed to thunder, and did nigh affray  
> That Capons courage: yet he looked grim,  
> And fain'd to cheare his Ladie in dismay;  
> Who seem'd for feare to quake in euery lim,  
> And her to saue from outrage, meekely prayed him.
>
> Fiercely that stranger forward came, and nigh  
> Approching, with bold words and bitter threat,  
> Bad that same boaster, as he mote, on high  
> To leaue to him that Lady for excheat,  
> Or bide him battell without further treat.  
> That challenge did too peremptory seeme,  
> And fild his senses with abashment great;  
> Yet seeing nigh him ieopardy extreme,  
> He it dissembled well, and light seem'd to esteeme.
>
> Saying, Thou foolish knight, that weenst with words  
> To steale away, that I with blowes haue wonne,  
> And brought through points of many perilous swords:  
> But if thee list to see thy Courser ronne,  
> Or proue thy selfe, this sad encounter shonne,  
> And seeke else without hazard of thy hed.  
> At those proud words that other knight begonne  
> To wexe exceeding wroth, and him ared  
> To turne his steede about, or sure he should be ded.
>
> Sith then (said *Braggadocchio*) needes thou wilt  
> Thy dayes abridge, through proofe of puissance,  
> Turne we our steedes, that both in equall tilt  
> May meet againe, and each take happie chance.  
> This said, they both a furlongs mountenance  
> Retyrd their steeds, to ronne in euen race:  
> But *Braggadocchio* with his bloudie lance  
> Once hauing turnd, no more returnd his face,  
> But left his loue to losse, and fled himselfe apace.
>
> The knight him seeing fly, had no regard  
> Him to poursew, but to the Ladie rode,  
> And hauing her from *Trompart* lightly reard,  
> Vpon his Courser set the louely lode,  
> And with her fled away without abode.  
> Well weened he, that fairest *Florimell*  
> It was, with whom in company he yode,  
> And so her selfe did alwaies to him tell;  
> So made him thinke him selfe in heauen, that was in hell.
>
> But *Florimell* her selfe was farre away,  
> Driuen to great distresse by Fortune straunge,  
> And taught the carefull Mariner to play,  
> Sith late mischaunce had her compeld to chaunge  
> The land for sea, at randon there to raunge:  
> Yet there that cruell Queene auengeresse,  
> Not satisfide so farre her to estraunge  
> From courtly blisse and wonted happinesse,  
> Did heape on her new waues of weary wretchednesse.
>
> For being fled into the fishers bote,  
> For refuge from the Monsters crueltie,  
> Long so she on the mightie maine did flote,  
> And with the tide droue forward careleslie;  
> For th'aire was milde, and cleared was the skie,  
> And all his windes *Dan Aeolus* did keepe,  
> From stirring vp their stormy enmitie,  
> As pittying to see her waile and weepe;  
> But all the while the fisher did securely sleepe.
>
> At last when droncke with drowsinesse, he woke,  
> And saw his drouer driue along the streame,  
> He was dismayd, and thrise his breast he stroke,  
> For maruell of that accident extreame;  
> But when he saw that blazing beauties beame,  
> Which with rare light his bote did beautifie,  
> He marueild more, and thought he yet did dreame  
> Not well awakt, or that some extasie  
> Assotted had his sense, or dazed was his eie.
>
> But when her well auizing, he perceiued  
> To be no vision, nor fantasticke sight,  
> Great comfort of her presence he conceiued,  
> And felt in his old courage new delight  
> To gin awake, and stirre his frozen spright:  
> Tho rudely askt her, how she thither came.  
> Ah (said she) father, I note read aright,  
> What hard misfortune brought me to the same;  
> Yet am I glad that here I now in safety am.
>
> But thou good man, sith farre in sea we bee,  
> And the great waters gin apace to swell,  
> That now no more we can the maine-land see,  
> Haue care, I pray, to guide the cock-bote well,  
> Least worse on sea then vs on land befell.  
> Thereat th'old man did nought but fondly grin,  
> And said, his boat the way could wisely tell:  
> But his deceiptfull eyes did neuer lin,  
> To looke on her faire face, and marke her snowy skin.
>
> The sight whereof in his congealed flesh,  
> Infixt such secret sting of greedy lust,  
> That the drie withered stocke it gan refresh,  
> And kindled heat, that soone in flame forth brust:  
> The driest wood is soonest burnt to dust.  
> Rudely to her he lept, and his rough hand  
> Where ill became him, rashly would haue thrust,  
> But she with angry scorne him did withstond,  
> And shamefully reproued for his rudenesse fond.
>
> But he, that neuer good nor maners knew,  
> Her sharpe rebuke full litle did esteeme;  
> Hard is to teach an old horse amble trew.  
> The inward smoke, that did before but steeme,  
> Broke into open fire and rage extreme,  
> And now he strength gan adde vnto his will,  
> Forcing to doe, that did him fowle misseeme:  
> Beastly he threw her downe, ne car'd to spill  
> Her garments gay with scales of fish, that all did fill.
>
> The silly virgin stroue him to withstand,  
> All that she might, and him in vaine reuild:  
> She struggled strongly both with foot and hand,  
> To saue her honor from that villaine vild,  
> And cride to heauen, from humane helpe exild.  
> O ye braue knights, that boast this Ladies loue,  
> Where be ye now, when she is nigh defild  
> Of filthy wretch? well may shee you reproue  
> Of falshood or of slouth, when most it may behoue.
>
> But if that thou, Sir *Satyran*, didst weete,  
> Or thou, Sir *Peridure*, her sorie state,  
> How soone would yee assemble many a fleete,  
> To fetch from sea, that ye at land lost late;  
> Towres, Cities, Kingdomes ye would ruinate,  
> In your auengement and dispiteous rage,  
> Ne ought your burning fury mote abate;  
> But if Sir *Calidore* could it presage,  
> No liuing creature could his cruelty asswage.
>
> But sith that none of all her knights is nye,  
> See how the heauens of voluntary grace,  
> And soueraine fauour towards chastity,  
> Doe succour send to her distressed cace:  
> So much high God doth innocence embrace.  
> It fortuned, whilest thus she stifly stroue,  
> And the wide sea importuned long space  
> With shrilling shriekes, *Proteus* abroad did roue,  
> Along the fomy waues driuing his finny droue.
>
> *Proteus* is Shepheard of the seas of yore,  
> And hath the charge of *Neptunes* mightie heard;  
> An aged sire with head all frory hore,  
> And sprinckled frost vpon his deawy beard:  
> Who when those pittifull outcries he heard,  
> Through all the seas so ruefully resound,  
> His charet swift in haste he thither steard,  
> Which with a teeme of scaly *Phocas* bound  
> Was drawne vpon the waues, that fomed him around.
>
> And comming to that Fishers wandring bote,  
> That went at will, withouten carde or sayle,  
> He therein saw that yrkesome sight, which smote  
> Deepe indignation and compassion frayle  
> Into his hart attonce: streight did he hayle  
> The greedy villein from his hoped pray,  
> Of which he now did very litle fayle,  
> And with his staffe, that driues his Heard astray,  
> Him bet so sore, that life and sense did much dismay.
>
> The whiles the pitteous Ladie vp did ryse,  
> Ruffled and fowly raid with filthy soyle,  
> And blubbred face with teares of her faire eyes:  
> Her heart nigh broken was with weary toyle,  
> To saue her selfe from that outrageous spoyle,  
> But when she looked vp, to weet, what wight  
> Had her from so infamous fact assoyld,  
> For shame, but more for feare of his grim sight,  
> Downe in her lap she hid her face, and loudly shright.
>
> Her selfe not saued yet from daunger dred  
> She thought, but chaung'd from one to other feare;  
> Like as a fearefull Partridge, that is fled  
> From the sharpe Hauke, which her attached neare,  
> And fals to ground, to seeke for succour theare,  
> Whereas the hungry Spaniels she does spy,  
> With greedy iawes her readie for to teare;  
> In such distresse and sad perplexity  
> Was *Florimell*, when *Proteus* she did see thereby.
>
> But he endeuoured with speeches milde  
> Her to recomfort, and accourage bold,  
> Bidding her feare no more her foeman vilde,  
> Nor doubt himselfe; and who he was, her told.  
> Yet all that could not from affright her hold,  
> Ne to recomfort her at all preuayld;  
> For her faint heart was with the frozen cold  
> Benumbd so inly, that her wits nigh fayld,  
> And all her senses with abashment quite were quayld.
>
> Her vp betwixt his rugged hands he reard,  
> And with his frory lips full softly kist,  
> Whiles the cold ysickles from his rough beard,  
> Dropped adowne vpon her yuorie brest:  
> Yet he himselfe so busily addrest,  
> That her out of astonishment he wrought,  
> And out of that same fishers filthy nest  
> Remouing her, into his charet brought,  
> And there with many gentle termes her faire besought.
>
> But that old leachour, which with bold assault  
> That beautie durst presume to violate,  
> He cast to punish for his hainous fault;  
> Then tooke he him yet trembling sith of late,  
> And tyde behind his charet, to aggrate  
> The virgin, whom he had abusde so sore:  
> So drag'd him through the waues in scornefull state,  
> And after cast him vp, vpon the shore;  
> But *Florimell* with him vnto his bowre he bore.
>
> His bowre is in the bottome of the maine,  
> Vnder a mightie rocke, gainst which do raue  
> The roaring billowes in their proud disdaine,  
> That with the angry working of the waue,  
> Therein is eaten out an hollow caue,  
> That seemes rough Masons hand with engines keene  
> Had long while laboured it to engraue:  
> There was his wonne, ne liuing wight was seene,  
> Saue one old *Nymph*, hight *Panope* to keepe it cleane.
>
> Thither he brought the sory *Florimell*,  
> And entertained her the best he might  
> And *Panope* her entertaind eke well,  
> As an immortall mote a mortall wight,  
> To winne her liking vnto his delight:  
> With flattering words he sweetly wooed her,  
> And offered faire gifts t'allure her sight,  
> But she both offers and the offerer  
> Despysde, and all the fawning of the flatterer.
>
> Daily he tempted her with this or that,  
> And neuer suffred her to be at rest:  
> But euermore she him refused flat,  
> And all his fained kindnesse did detest.  
> So firmely she had sealed vp her brest.  
> Sometimes he boasted, that a God he hight:  
> But she a mortall creature loued best:  
> Then he would make himselfe a mortall wight;  
> But then she said she lou'd none, but a Faerie knight.
>
> Then like a Faerie knight himselfe he drest;  
> For euery shape on him he could endew:  
> Then like a king he was to her exprest,  
> And offred kingdomes vnto her in vew,  
> To be his Leman and his Ladie trew:  
> But when all this he nothing saw preuaile,  
> With harder meanes he cast her to subdew,  
> And with sharpe threates her often did assaile,  
> So thinking for to make her stubborne courage quaile.
>
> To dreadfull shapes he did himselfe transforme,  
> Now like a Gyant, now like to a feend,  
> Then like a Centaure, then like to a storme,  
> Raging within the waues: thereby he weend  
> Her will to win vnto his wished end.  
> But when with feare, nor fauour, nor with all  
> He else could doe, he saw himselfe esteemd,  
> Downe in a Dongeon deepe he let her fall,  
> And threatned there to make her his eternall thrall.
>
> Eternall thraldome was to her more liefe,  
> Then losse of chastitie, or chaunge of loue:  
> Die had she rather in tormenting griefe,  
> Then any should of falsenesse her reproue,  
> Or loosenesse, that she lightly did remoue.  
> Most vertuous virgin, glory be thy meed,  
> And crowne of heauenly praise with Saints aboue,  
> Where most sweet hymmes of this thy famous deed  
> Are still emongst them song, that far my rymes exceed.
>
> Fit song of Angels caroled to bee;  
> But yet what so my feeble Muse can frame,  
> Shall be t'aduance thy goodly chastitee,  
> And to enroll thy memorable name,  
> In th'heart of euery honourable Dame,  
> That they thy vertuous deedes may imitate,  
> And be partakers of thy endlesse fame.  
> It yrkes me, leaue thee in this wofull state,  
> To tell of *Satyrane*, where I him left of late.
>
> Who hauing ended with that *Squire of Dames*  
> A long discourse of his aduentures vaine,  
> The which himselfe, then Ladies more defames,  
> And finding not th'*Hyena* to be slaine,  
> With that same *Squyre*, returned backe againe  
> To his first way. And as they forward went,  
> They spyde a knight faire pricking on the plaine,  
> As if he were on some aduenture bent,  
> And in his port appeared manly hardiment.
>
> Sir *Satyrane* him towards did addresse,  
> To weet, what wight he was, and what his quest:  
> And comming nigh, eftsoones he gan to gesse  
> Both by the burning hart, which on his brest  
> He bare, and by the colours in his crest,  
> That *Paridell* it was. Tho to him yode,  
> And him saluting, as beseemed best,  
> Gan first inquire of tydings farre abrode;  
> And afterwardes, on what aduenture now he rode.
>
> Who thereto answering, said; the tydings bad,  
> Which now in Faerie court all men do tell,  
> Which turned hath great mirth, to mourning sad,  
> Is the late ruine of proud *Marinell*,  
> And suddein parture of faire *Florimell*,  
> To find him forth: and after her are gone  
> All the braue knights, that doen in armes excell,  
> To saueguard her, ywandred all alone;  
> Emongst the rest my lot (vnworthy) is to be one.
>
> Ah gentle knight (said then Sir *Satyrane*)  
> Thy labour all is lost, I greatly dread,  
> That hast a thanklesse seruice on thee ta'ne,  
> And offrest sacrifice vnto the dead:  
> For dead, I surely doubt, thou maist aread  
> Henceforth for euer *Florimell* to be.  
> That all the noble knights of *Maydenhead*,  
> Which her ador'd, may sore repent with me,  
> And all faire Ladies may for euer sory be.
>
> Which words when *Paridell* had heard, his hew  
> Gan greatly chaunge, and seem'd dismayd to bee;  
> Then said, Faire Sir, how may I weene it trew,  
> That ye doe tell in such vncertaintee?  
> Or speake ye of report, or did ye see  
> Iust cause of dread, that makes ye doubt so sore?  
> For perdie else how mote it euer bee,  
> That euer hand should dare for to engore  
> Her noble bloud? the heauens such crueltie abhore.
>
> These eyes did see, that they will euer rew  
> T'haue seene, (quoth he) when as a monstrous beast  
> The Palfrey, whereon she did trauell, slew,  
> And of his bowels made his bloudie feast:  
> Which speaking token sheweth at the least  
> Her certaine losse, if not her sure decay:  
> Besides, that more suspition encreast,  
> I found her golden girdle cast astray,  
> Distaynd with durt and bloud, as relique of the pray.
>
> Aye me, (said *Paridell*) the signes be sad,  
> And but God turne the same to good soothsay,  
> That Ladies safetie is sore to be drad:  
> Yet will I not forsake my forward way,  
> Till triall doe more certaine truth bewray.  
> Faire Sir (quoth he) well may it you succeed,  
> Ne long shall *Satyrane* behind you stay,  
> But to the rest, which in this Quest proceed  
> My labour adde, and be partaker of their speed.
>
> Ye noble knights (said then the *Squire of Dames*)  
> Well may ye speed in so praiseworthy paine:  
> But sith the Sunne now ginnes to slake his beames,  
> In deawy vapours of the westerne maine,  
> And lose the teme out of his weary waine,  
> Mote not mislike you also to abate  
> Your zealous hast, till morrow next againe  
> Both light of heauen, and strength of men relate:  
> Which if ye please, to yonder castle turne your gate.
>
> That counsell pleased well; so all yfere  
> Forth marched to a Castle them before,  
> Where soone arriuing, they restrained were  
> Of readie entrance, which ought euermore  
> To errant knights be commun: wondrous sore  
> Thereat displeasd they were, till that young Squire  
> Gan them informe the cause, why that same dore  
> Was shut to all, which lodging did desire:  
> The which to let you weet, will further time require.
