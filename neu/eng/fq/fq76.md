*Cant. XI.*

> *The theeues fall out for Pastorell,  
> VVhilest Melibee is slaine:  
> Her Calidore from them redeemes,  
> And bringeth backe againe.*

> T He ioyes of loue, if they should euer last,  
> Without affliction or disquietnesse,  
> That worldly chaunces doe amongst them cast,  
> Would be on earth too great a blessednesse,  
> Liker to heauen, then mortall wretchednesse.  
> Therefore the winged God, to let men weet,  
> That here on earth is no sure happinesse,  
> A thousand sowres hath tempred with one sweet,  
> To make it seeme more deare and dainty, as is meet.
>
> Like as is now befalne to this faire Mayd,  
> Faire *Pastorell*, of whom is now my song,  
> Who being now in dreadfull darknesse layd,  
> Amongst those theeues, which her in bondage strong  
> Detaynd, yet Fortune not with all this wrong  
> Contented, greater mischiefe on her threw,  
> And sorrowes heapt on her in greater throng;  
> That who so heares her heauinesse, would rew  
> And pitty her sad plight, so chang'd from pleasaunt hew.
>
> Whylest thus she in these hellish dens remayned,  
> Wrapped in wretched cares and hearts vnrest,  
> It so befell (as Fortune had ordayned)  
> That he, which was their Capitaine profest,  
> And had the chiefe commaund of all the rest,  
> One day as he did all his prisoners vew,  
> With lustfull eyes, beheld that louely guest,  
> Faire *Pastorella*, whose sad mournefull hew  
> Like the faire Morning clad in misty fog did shew.
>
> At sight whereof his barbarous heart was fired,  
> And inly burnt with flames most raging whot,  
> That her alone he for his part desired  
> Of all the other pray, which they had got,  
> And her in mynde did to him selfe allot.  
> From that day forth he kyndnesse to her showed,  
> And sought her loue, by all the meanes he mote;  
> With looks, with words, with gifts he oft her wowed;  
> And mixed threats among, and much vnto her vowed.
>
> But all that euer he could doe or say,  
> Her constant mynd could not a whit remoue,  
> Nor draw vnto the lure of his lewd lay,  
> To graunt him fauour, or afford him loue.  
> Yet ceast he not to sew and all waies proue,  
> By which he mote accomplish his request,  
> Saying and doing all that mote behoue;  
> Ne day nor night he suffred her to rest,  
> But her all night did watch, and all the day molest.
>
> At last, when him she so importune saw,  
> Fearing least he at length the raines would lend  
> Vnto his lust, and make his will his law,  
> Sith in his powre she was to foe or frend;  
> She thought it best, for shadow to pretend  
> Some shew of fauour, by him gracing small,  
> That she thereby mote either freely wend,  
> Or at more ease continue there his thrall:  
> A little well is lent, that gaineth more withall.
>
> So from thenceforth, when loue he to her made,  
> With better tearmes she did him entertaine;  
> Which gaue him hope, and did him halfe perswade,  
> That he in time her ioyaunce should obtaine.  
> But when she saw, through that small fauours gaine,  
> That further, then she willing was, he prest;  
> She found no meanes to barre him, but to faine  
> A sodaine sickenesse, which her sore opprest,  
> And made vnfit to serue his lawlesse mindes behest.
>
> By meanes whereof she would not him permit  
> Once to approch to her in priuity,  
> But onely mongst the rest by her to sit,  
> Mourning the rigour of her malady,  
> And seeking all things meete for remedy.  
> But she resolu'd no remedy to fynde,  
> Nor better cheare to shew in misery,  
> Till Fortune would her captiue bonds vnbynde:  
> Her sickenesse was not of the body but the mynde.
>
> During which space that she thus sicke did lie,  
> It chaunst a sort of merchants, which were wount  
> To skim those coastes, for bondmen there to buy,  
> And by such trafficke after gaines to hunt,  
> Arriued in this Isle though bare and blunt,  
> T'inquire for slaues; where being readie met  
> By some of these same theeues at the instant brunt,  
> Were brought vnto their Captaine, who was set  
> By his faire patients side with sorrowfull regret.
>
> To whom they shewed, how those marchants were  
> Arriu'd in place, their bondslaues for to buy;  
> And therefore prayd, that those same captiues there  
> Mote to them for their most commodity  
> Be sold, and mongst them shared equally.  
> This their request the Captaine much appalled;  
> Yet could he not their iust demaund deny,  
> And willed streight the slaues should forth be called,  
> And sold for most aduantage not to be forstalled.
>
> Then forth the good old *Meliboe* was brought,  
> And *Coridon*, with many other moe,  
> Whom they before in diuerse spoyles had caught:  
> All which he to the marchants sale did showe.  
> Till some, which did the sundry prisoners knowe,  
> Gan to inquire for that faire shepherdesse,  
> Which with the rest they tooke not long agoe,  
> And gan her forme and feature to expresse,  
> The more t'augment her price, through praise of comlinesse.
>
> To whom the Captaine in full angry wize  
> Made answere, that the Mayd of whom they spake,  
> Was his owne purchase and his onely prize,  
> With which none had to doe, ne ought partake,  
> But he himselfe, which did that conquest make;  
> Litle for him to haue one silly lasse:  
> Besides, through sicknesse now so wan and weake,  
> That nothing meet in marchandise to passe.  
> So shew'd them her, to proue how pale & weake she was.
>
> The sight of whom, though now decayd and mard,  
> And eke but hardly seene by candle-light:  
> Yet like a Diamond of rich regard,  
> In doubtfull shadow of the darkesome night,  
> With starrie beames about her shining bright,  
> These marchants fixed eyes did so amaze,  
> That what through wonder, & what through delight,  
> Awhile on her they greedily did gaze,  
> And did her greatly like, and did her greatly praize.
>
> At last when all the rest them offred were,  
> And prises to them placed at their pleasure,  
> They all refused in regard of her,  
> Ne ought would buy, how euer prisd with measure,  
> Withouten her, whose worth aboue all threasure  
> They did esteeme, and offred store of gold.  
> But then the Captaine fraught with more displeasure,  
> Bad them be still, his loue should not be sold:  
> The rest take if they would, he her to him would hold.
>
> Therewith some other of the chiefest theeues  
> Boldly him bad such iniurie forbeare;  
> For that same mayd, how euer it him greeues,  
> Should with the rest be sold before him theare,  
> To make the prises of the rest more deare.  
> That with great rage he stoutly doth denay;  
> And fiercely drawing forth his blade, doth sweare,  
> That who so hardie hand on her doth lay,  
> It dearely shall aby, and death for handsell pay.
>
> Thus as they words amongst them multiply,  
> They fall to strokes, the frute of too much talke:  
> And the mad steele about doth fiercely fly,  
> Not sparing wight, ne leauing any balke,  
> But making way for death at large to walke:  
> Who in the horror of the griesly night,  
> In thousand dreadful shapes doth mongst them stalke,  
> And makes huge hauocke, whiles the candlelight  
> Out quenched, leaues no skill nor difference of wight.
>
> Like as a sort of hungry dogs ymet  
> About some carcase by the common way,  
> Doe fall together, stryuing each to get  
> The greatest portion of the greedie pray;  
> All on confused heapes themselues assay,  
> And snatch, and byte, and rend, and tug, and teare;  
> That who them sees, would wonder at their fray,  
> And who sees not, would be affrayd to heare:  
> Such was the conflict of those cruell *Brigants* there.
>
> But first of all, their captiues they doe kill,  
> Least they should ioyne against the weaker side,  
> Or rise against the remnant at their will;  
> Old *Meliboe* is slaine, and him beside  
> His aged wife, with many others wide:  
> But *Coridon* escaping craftily,  
> Creepes forth of dores, whilst darknes him doth hide,  
> And flyes away as fast as he can hye,  
> Ne stayeth leaue to take, before his friends doe dye.
>
> But *Pastorella*, wofull wretched Elfe,  
> Was by the Captaine all this while defended:  
> Who minding more her safety then himselfe,  
> His target alwayes ouer her pretended;  
> By meanes whereof, that mote not be amended,  
> He at the length was slaine, and layd on ground,  
> Yet holding fast twixt both his armes extended  
> Fayre *Pastorell*, who with the selfe same wound  
> Lanc't through the arme, fell down with him in drerie swound.
>
> There lay she couered with confused preasse  
> Of carcases, which dying on her fell.  
> Tho when as he was dead, the fray gan ceasse,  
> And each to other calling, did compell  
> To stay their cruell hands from slaughter fell.  
> Sith they that were the cause of all, were gone.  
> Thereto they all attonce agreed well,  
> And lighting candles new, gan search anone,  
> How many of their friends were slaine, how many fone.
>
> Their Captaine there they cruelly found kild,  
> And in his armes the dreary dying mayd,  
> Like a sweet Angell twixt two clouds vphild:  
> Her louely light was dimmed and decayd,  
> With cloud of death vpon her eyes displayd;  
> Yet did the cloud make euen that dimmed light  
> Seeme much more louely in that darknesse layd,  
> And twixt the twinckling of her eye-lids bright,  
> To sparke out litle beames, like starres in foggie night.
>
> But when they mou'd the carcases aside,  
> They found that life did yet in her remaine:  
> Then all their helpes they busily applyde,  
> To call the soule backe to her home againe;  
> And wrought so well with labour and long paine,  
> That they to life recouered her at last.  
> Who sighing sore, as if her hart in twaine  
> Had riuen bene, and all her hart strings brast,  
> With drearie drouping eyne lookt vp like one aghast.
>
> There she beheld, that sore her grieu'd to see,  
> Her father and her friends about her lying,  
> Her selfe sole left, a second spoyle to bee  
> Of those, that hauing saued her from dying,  
> Renew'd her death by timely death denying:  
> What now is left her, but to wayle and weepe,  
> Wringing her hands, and ruefully loud crying?  
> Ne cared she her wound in teares to steepe,  
> Albe with all their might those *Brigants* her did keepe.
>
> But when they saw her now reliu'd againe,  
> They left her so, in charge of one the best  
> Of many worst, who with vnkind disdaine  
> And cruell rigour her did much molest;  
> Scarse yeelding her due food, or timely rest,  
> And scarsely suffring her infestred wound,  
> That sore her payn'd, by any to be drest,  
> So leaue we her in wretched thraldome bound,  
> And turne we backe to *Calidore*, where we him found.
>
> Who when he backe returned from the wood,  
> And saw his shepheards cottage spoyled quight,  
> And his Loue reft away, he wexed wood,  
> And halfe enraged at that ruefull sight;  
> That euen his hart for very fell despight,  
> And his owne flesh he readie was to teare:  
> He chauft, he grieu'd, he fretted, and he sigh't,  
> And fared like a furious wyld Beare,  
> Whose whelpes are stolne away, she being otherwhere.
>
> Ne wight he found, to whom he might complaine,  
> Ne wight he found, of whom he might inquire;  
> That more increast the anguish of his paine.  
> He sought the woods; but no man could see there;  
> He sought the plaines; but could no tydings heare.  
> The woods did nought but ecchoes vaine rebound;  
> The playnes all waste and emptie did appeare:  
> Where wont the shepheards oft their pypes resound,  
> And feed an hundred flocks, there now not one he found.
>
> At last as there he romed vp and downe,  
> He chaunst one comming towards him to spy,  
> That seem'd to be some sorie simple clowne,  
> With ragged weedes, and lockes vpstaring hye,  
> As if he did from some late daunger fly,  
> And yet his feare did follow him behynd:  
> Who as he vnto him approched nye,  
> He mote perceiue by signes, which he did fynd,  
> That *Coridon* it was, the silly shepherds hynd.
>
> Tho to him running fast, he did not stay  
> To greet him first, but askt were where the rest;  
> Where *Pastorell*? who full of fresh dismay,  
> And gushing forth in teares, was so opprest,  
> That he no word could speake, but smit his brest,  
> And vp to heauen his eyes fast streming threw.  
> Whereat the knight amaz'd, yet did not rest,  
> But askt againe, what ment that rufull hew;  
> Where was his *Pastorell*? where all the other crew?
>
> Ah well away (sayd he then sighing sore)  
> That euer I did liue, this day to see,  
> This dismall day, and was not dead before,  
> Before I saw faire *Pastorella* dye.  
> Die? out alas! then *Calidore* did cry:  
> How could the death dare euer her to quell?  
> But read thou shepheard, read what destiny,  
> Or other dyrefull hap from heauen or hell  
> Hath wrought this wicked deed: doe feare away, and tell.
>
> Tho when the shepheard breathed had awhile,  
> He thus began: Where shall I then commence  
> This wofull tale? or how those *Brigants* vyle,  
> With cruell rage and dreadfull violence  
> Spoyld all our cots, and caried vs from hence?  
> Or how faire *Pastorell* should haue bene sold  
> To marchants, but was sau'd with strong defence?  
> Or how those theeues, whilest one sought her to hold,  
> Fell all at ods, and fought through fury fierce and bold.
>
> In that same conflict (woe is me) befell  
> This fatall chaunce, this dolefull accident,  
> Whose heauy tydings now I haue to tell.  
> First all the captiues, which they here had hent,  
> Were by them slaine by generall consent;  
> Old *Meliboe* and his good wife withall  
> These eyes saw die, and dearely did lament:  
> But when the lot to *Pastorell* did fall,  
> Their Captaine long withstood, & did her death forstall.
>
> But what could he gainst all them doe alone?  
> It could not boot, needs mote she die at last:  
> I onely scapt through great confusione  
> Of cryes and clamors, which amongst them past,  
> In dreadfull darknesse dreadfully aghast;  
> That better were with them to haue bene dead,  
> Then here to see all desolate and wast,  
> Despoyled of those ioyes and iollyhead,  
> Which with those gentle shepherds here I wont to lead.
>
> When *Calidore* these ruefull newes had raught,  
> His hart quite deaded was with anguish great,  
> And all his wits with doole were nigh distraught,  
> That he his face, his head, his brest did beat,  
> And death it selfe vnto himselfe did threat;  
> Oft cursing th'heauens, that so cruell were  
> To her, whose name he often did repeat;  
> And wishing oft, that he were present there,  
> When she was slaine, or had bene to her succour nere.
>
> But after griefe awhile had had his course,  
> And spent it selfe in mourning, he at last  
> Began to mitigate his swelling sourse,  
> And in his mind with better reason cast,  
> How he might saue her life, if life did last;  
> Or if that dead, how he her death might wreake,  
> Sith otherwise he could not mend thing past;  
> Or if it to reuenge he were too weake,  
> Then for to die with her, and his liues threed to breake.
>
> Tho *Coridon* he prayd, sith he well knew  
> The readie way vnto that theeuish wonne,  
> To wend with him, and be his conduct trew  
> Vnto the place, to see what should be donne.  
> But he, whose hart through feare was late fordonne,  
> Would not for ought be drawne to former drede,  
> But by all meanes the daunger knowne did shonne:  
> Yet *Calidore* so well him wrought with meed,  
> And faire bespoke with words, that he at last agreed.
>
> So forth they goe together (God before)  
> Both clad in shepheards weeds agreeably,  
> And both with shepheards hookes: But *Calidore*  
> Had vnderneath, him armed priuily.  
> Tho to the place when they approched nye,  
> They chaunst, vpon an hill not farre away,  
> Some flockes of sheepe and shepheards to espy;  
> To whom they both agreed to take their way,  
> In hope there newes to learne, how they mote best assay.
>
> There did they find, that which they did not feare,  
> The selfe same flocks, the which those theeues had reft  
> From *Meliboe* and from themselues whyleare,  
> And certaine of the theeues there by them left,  
> The which for want of heards themselues then kept.  
> Right well knew *Coridon* his owne late sheepe,  
> And seeing them, for tender pittie wept:  
> But when he saw the theeues, which did them keepe,  
> His hart gan fayle, albe he saw them all asleepe.
>
> But *Calidore* recomforting his griefe,  
> Though not his feare; for nought may feare disswade;  
> Him hardly forward drew, whereas the thiefe  
> Lay sleeping soundly in the bushes shade,  
> Whom *Coridon* him counseld to inuade  
> Now all vnwares, and take the spoyle away;  
> But he, that in his mind had closely made  
> A further purpose, would not so them slay,  
> But gently waking them, gaue them the time of day.
>
> Tho sitting downe by them vpon the greene,  
> Of sundrie things he purpose gan to faine;  
> That he by them might certaine tydings weene  
> Of *Pastorell*, were she aliue or slaine.  
> Mongst which the theeues them questioned againe,  
> What mister men, and eke from whence they were.  
> To whom they answer'd, as did appertaine,  
> That they were poore heardgroomes, the which whylere  
> Had from their maisters fled, & now sought hyre elswhere.
>
> Whereof right glad they seem'd, and offer made  
> To hyre them well, if they their flockes would keepe:  
> For they themselues were euill groomes, they sayd,  
> Vnwont with heards to watch, or pasture sheepe,  
> But to forray the land, or scoure the deepe.  
> Thereto they soone agreed, and earnest tooke,  
> To keepe their flockes for litle hyre and chepe:  
> For they for better hyre did shortly looke,  
> So there all day they bode, till light the sky forsooke.
>
> Tho when as towards darksome night it drew,  
> Vnto their hellish dens those theeues them brought;  
> Where shortly they in great acquaintance grew,  
> And all the secrets of their entrayles sought.  
> There did they find, contrarie to their thought,  
> That *Pastorell* yet liu'd, but all the rest  
> Were dead, right so as *Coridon* had taught:  
> Whereof they both full glad and blyth did rest,  
> But chiefly *Calidore*, whom griefe had most possest.
>
> At length when they occasion fittest found,  
> In dead of night, when all the theeues did rest  
> After a late forray, and slept full sound,  
> Sir *Calidore* him arm'd, as he thought best,  
> Hauing of late by diligent inquest,  
> Prouided him a sword of meanest sort:  
> With which he streight went to the Captaines nest.  
> But *Coridon* durst not with him consort,  
> Ne durst abide behind, for dread of worse effort.
>
> When to the Caue they came, they found it fast:  
> But *Calidore* with huge resistlesse might,  
> The dores assayled, and the locks vpbrast.  
> With noyse whereof the theefe awaking light,  
> Vnto the entrance ran: where the bold knight  
> Encountring him with small resistance slew;  
> The whiles faire *Pastorell* through great affright  
> Was almost dead, misdoubting least of new  
> Some vprore were like that, which lately she did vew.
>
> But when as *Calidore* was comen in,  
> And gan aloud for *Pastorell* to call;  
> Knowing his voice although not heard long sin,  
> She sudden was reuiued therewithall,  
> And wondrous ioy felt in her spirits thrall:  
> Like him that being long in tempest tost,  
> Looking each houre into deathes mouth to fall,  
> At length espyes at hand the happie cost,  
> On which he safety hopes, that earst feard to be lost.
>
> Her gentle hart, that now long season past  
> Had neuer ioyance felt, nor chearefull thought,  
> Began some smacke of comfort new to tast,  
> Like lyfull heat to nummed senses brought,  
> And life to feele, that long for death had sought;  
> Ne lesse in hart reioyced *Calidore*,  
> When he her found, but like to one distraught,  
> And robd of reason, towards her him bore,  
> A thousand times embrast, and kist a thousand more.
>
> But now by this, with noyse of late vprore,  
> The hue and cry was raysed all about;  
> And all the *Brigants* flocking in great store,  
> Vnto the caue gan preasse, nought hauing dout  
> Of that was doen, and entred in a rout.  
> But *Calidore* in th'entry close did stand,  
> And entertayning them with courage stout,  
> Still slew the formost, that came first to hand,  
> So long till all the entry was with bodies mand.
>
> Tho when no more could nigh to him approch,  
> He breath'd his sword, and rested him till day:  
> Which when he spyde vpon the earth t'encroch,  
> Through the dead carcases he made his way;  
> Mongst which he found a sword of better say,  
> With which he forth went into th'open light:  
> Where all the rest for him did readie stay,  
> And fierce assayling him, with all their might  
> Gan all vpon him lay: there gan a dreadfull fight.
>
> How many flyes in whottest sommers day  
> Do seize vpon some beast, whose flesh is bare,  
> That all the place with swarmes do ouerlay,  
> And with their litle stings right felly fare;  
> So many theeues about him swarming are,  
> All which do him assayle on euery side,  
> And sore oppresse, ne any him doth spare:  
> But he doth with his raging brond diuide  
> Their thickest troups, & round about him scattreth wide.
>
> Like as a Lion mongst an heard of dere,  
> Disperseth them to catch his choysest pray;  
> So did he fly amongst them here and there,  
> And all that nere him came, did hew and slay,  
> Till he had strowd with bodies all the way;  
> That none his daunger daring to abide,  
> Fled from his wrath, and did themselues conuay  
> Into their caues, their heads from death to hide,  
> Ne any left, that victorie to him enuide.
>
> Then backe returning to his dearest deare,  
> He her gan to recomfort, all he might,  
> With gladfull speaches, and with louely cheare,  
> And forth her bringing to the ioyous light,  
> Whereof she long had lackt the wishfull sight,  
> Deuiz'd all goodly meanes, from her to driue  
> The sad remembrance of her wretched plight.  
> So her vneath at last he did reuiue,  
> That long had lyen dead, and made againe aliue.
>
> This doen, into those theeuish dens he went,  
> And thence did all the spoyles and threasures take,  
> Which they from many long had robd and rent,  
> But fortune now the victors meed did make;  
> Of which the best he did his loue betake;  
> And also all those flockes, which they before  
> Had reft from *Meliboe*, and from his make,  
> He did them all to *Coridon* restore.  
> So droue them all away, and his loue with him bore.
