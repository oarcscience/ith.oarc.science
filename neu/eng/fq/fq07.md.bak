*Cant. V.*

> *The faithfull knight in equall field  
> subdewes his faithlesse foe,  
> Whom false Duessa saues, and for  
> his cure to hell does goe.*

> THe noble hart, that harbours vertuous thought,  
>    And is with child of glorious great intent,  
>    Can neuer rest, vntill it forth haue brought  
>    Th'eternall brood of glorie excellent:  
>    Such restlesse passion did all night torment  
>    The flaming corage of that Faery knight,  
>    Deuizing, how that doughtie turnament  
>    With greatest honour he atchieuen might;  
> Still did he wake, and still did watch for dawning light.
>
> At last the golden Orientall gate  
>    Of greatest heauen gan to open faire,  
>    And *Phoebus* fresh, as bridegrome to his mate,  
>    Came dauncing forth, shaking his deawie haire:  
>    And hurld his glistring beames through gloomy aire.  
>    Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiu'd, streight way  
>    He started vp, and did him selfe prepaire,  
>    In sun-bright armes, and battailous array:  
> For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day.
>
> And forth he comes into the commune hall,  
>    Where earely waite him many a gazing eye,  
>    To weet what end to straunger knights may fall.  
>    There many Minstrales maken melody,  
>    To driue away the dull melancholy,  
>    And many Bardes, that to the trembling chord  
>    Can tune their timely voyces cunningly,  
>    And many Chroniclers, that can record  
> Old loues, and warres for Ladies doen by many a Lord.
>
> Soone after comes the cruell Sarazin,  
>    In wouen maile all armed warily,  
>    And sternly lookes at him, who not a pin  
>    Does care for looke of liuing creatures eye.  
>    They bring them wines of *Greece* and *Araby*,  
>    And daintie spices fetcht from furthest *Ynd*,  
>    To kindle heat of corage priuily:  
>    And in the wine a solemne oth they bynd  
> T'obserue the sacred lawes of armes, that are assynd.
>
> At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene,  
>    With royall pomp and Princely maiestie;  
>    She is ybrought vnto a paled greene,  
>    And placed vnder stately canapee,  
>    The warlike feates of both those knights to see.  
>    On th'other side in all mens open vew  
>    *Duessa* placed is, and on a tree  
>    *Sans-foy* his shield is hangd with bloudy hew:  
> Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew.
>
> A shrilling trompet sownded from on hye,  
>    And vnto battaill bad them selues addresse:  
>    Their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tye,  
>    And burning blades about their heads do blesse,  
>    The instruments of wrath and heauinesse:  
>    With greedy force each other doth assayle,  
>    And strike so fiercely, that they do impresse  
>    Deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle;  
> The yron walles to ward their blowes are weake & fraile.
>
> The Sarazin was stout, and wondrous strong,  
>    And heaped blowes like yron hammers great:  
>    For after bloud and vengeance he did long.  
>    The knight was fiers, and full of youthly heat:  
>    And doubled strokes, like dreaded thunders threat:  
>    For all for prayse and honour he did fight.  
>    Both stricken strike, and beaten both do beat,  
>    That from their shields forth flyeth firie light,  
> And helmets hewen deepe, shew marks of eithers might.
>
> So th'one for wrong, the other striues for right:  
>    As when a Gryfon seized of his pray,  
>    A Dragon fiers encountreth in his flight,  
>    Through widest ayre making his ydle way,  
>    That would his rightfull rauine rend away:  
>    With hideous horrour both together smight,  
>    And souce so sore, that they the heauens affray:  
>    The wise Southsayer seeing so sad sight,  
> Th'amazed vulgar tels of warres and mortall fight.
>
> So th'one for wrong, the other striues for right,  
>    And each to deadly shame would driue his foe:  
>    The cruell steele so greedily doth bight  
>    In tender flesh, that streames of bloud down flow,  
>    With which the armes, that earst so bright did show,  
>    Into a pure vermillion now are dyde:  
>    Great ruth in all the gazers harts did grow,  
>    Seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde,  
> That victory they dare not wish to either side.
>
> At last the Paynim chaunst to cast his eye,  
>    His suddein eye, flaming with wrathfull fyre,  
>    Vpon his brothers shield, which hong thereby:  
>    Therewith redoubled was his raging yre,  
>    And said, Ah wretched sonne of wofull syre,  
>    Doest thou sit wayling by black *Stygian* lake,  
>    Whilest here thy shield is hangd for victors hyre,  
>    And sluggish german doest thy forces slake,  
> To after-send his foe, that him may ouertake?
>
> Goe caytiue Elfe, him quickly ouertake,  
>    And soone redeeme from his long wandring woe;  
>    Goe guiltie ghost, to him my message make,  
>    That I his shield haue quit from dying foe.  
>    Therewith vpon his crest he stroke him so,  
>    That twise he reeled, readie twise to fall;  
>    End of the doubtfull battell deemed tho  
>    The lookers on, and lowd to him gan call  
> The false *Duessa*, Thine the shield, and I, and all.
>
> Soone as the Faerie heard his Ladie speake,  
>    Out of his swowning dreame he gan awake,  
>    And quickning faith, that earst was woxen weake,  
>    The creeping deadly cold away did shake:  
>    Tho mou'd with wrath, and shame, and Ladies sake,  
>    Of all attonce he cast auengd to bee,  
>    And with so'exceeding furie at him strake,  
>    That forced him to stoupe vpon his knee;  
> Had he not stouped so, he should haue clouen bee.
>
> And to him said, Goe now proud Miscreant,  
>    Thy selfe thy message doe to german deare,  
>    Alone he wandring thee too long doth want:  
>    Goe say, his foe thy shield with his doth beare.  
>    Therewith his heauie hand he high gan reare,  
>    Him to haue slaine; when loe a darkesome clowd  
>    Vpon him fell: he no where doth appeare,  
>    But vanisht is. The Elfe him cals alowd,  
> But answer none receiues: the darknes him does shrowd.
>
> In haste *Duessa* from her place arose,  
>    And to him running said, O prowest knight,  
>    That euer Ladie to her loue did chose,  
>    Let now abate the terror of your might,  
>    And quench the flame of furious despight,  
>    And bloudie vengeance; lo th'infernall powres  
>    Couering your foe with cloud of deadly night,  
>    Haue borne him hence to *Plutoes* balefull bowres.  
> The conquest yours, I yours, the shield, and glory yours.
>
> Not all so satisfide, with greedie eye  
>    He sought all round about, his thirstie blade  
>    To bath in bloud of faithlesse enemy;  
>    Who all that while lay hid in secret shade:  
>    He standes amazed, how he thence should fade.  
>    At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie,  
>    And running Heralds humble homage made,  
>    Greeting him goodly with new victorie,  
> And to him brought the shield, the cause of enmitie.
>
> Wherewith he goeth to that soueraine Queene,  
>    And falling her before on lowly knee,  
>    To her makes present of his seruice seene:  
>    Which she accepts, with thankes, and goodly gree,  
>    Greatly aduauncing his gay cheualree.  
>    So marcheth home, and by her takes the knight,  
>    Whom all the people follow with great glee,  
>    Shouting, and clapping all their hands on hight,  
> That all the aire it fils, and flyes to heauen bright.
>
> Home is he brought, and laid in sumptuous bed:  
>    Where many skilfull leaches him abide,  
>    To salue his hurts, that yet still freshly bled.  
>    In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide,  
>    And softly can embalme on euery side.  
>    And all the while, most heauenly melody  
>    About the bed sweet musicke did diuide,  
>    Him to beguile of griefe and agony:  
> And all the while *Duessa* wept full bitterly.
>
> As when a wearie traueller that strayes  
>    By muddy shore of broad seuen-mouthed *Nile*,  
>    Vnweeting of the perillous wandring wayes,  
>    Doth meet a cruell craftie Crocodile,  
>    Which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile,  
>    Doth weepe full sore, and sheddeth tender teares:  
>    The foolish man, that pitties all this while  
>    His mournefull plight, is swallowd vp vnwares,  
> Forgetfull of his owne, that mindes anothers cares.
>
> So wept *Duessa* vntill euentide,  
>    That shyning lampes in *Ioues* high house were light:  
>    Then forth she rose, ne lenger would abide,  
>    But comes vnto the place, where th'Hethen knight  
>    In slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright,  
>    Lay couer'd with inchaunted cloud all day:  
>    Whom when she found, as she him left in plight,  
>    To wayle his woefull case she would not stay,  
> But to the easterne coast of heauen makes speedy way.
>
> Where griesly *Night*, with visage deadly sad,  
>    That *Phoebus* chearefull face durst neuer vew,  
>    And in a foule blacke pitchie mantle clad,  
>    She findes forth comming from her darkesome mew,  
>    Where she all day did hide her hated hew.  
>    Before the dore her yron charet stood,  
>    Alreadie harnessed for iourney new;  
>    And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood,  
> That on their rustie bits did champ, as they were wood.
>
> Who when she saw *Duessa* sunny bright,  
>    Adornd with gold and iewels shining cleare,  
>    She greatly grew amazed at the sight,  
>    And th'vnacquainted light began to feare:  
>    For neuer did such brightnesse there appeare,  
>    And would haue backe retyred to her caue,  
>    Vntill the witches speech she gan to heare,  
>    Saying, Yet ô thou dreaded Dame, I craue  
> Abide, till I haue told the message, which I haue.
>
> She stayd, and foorth *Duessa* gan proceede,  
>    O thou most auncient Grandmother of all,  
>    More old then *Ioue*, whom thou at first didst breede,  
>    Or that great house of Gods cælestiall,  
>    Which wast begot in *Dæmogorgons* hall,  
>    And sawst the secrets of the world vnmade,  
>    Why suffredst thou thy Nephewes deare to fall  
>    With Elfin sword, most shamefully betrade?  
> Lo where the stout *Sansioy* doth sleepe in deadly shade.
>
> And him before, I saw with bitter eyes  
>    The bold *Sansfoy* shrinke vnderneath his speare;  
>    And now the pray of fowles in field he lyes,  
>    Nor wayld of friends, nor laid on groning beare,  
>    That whylome was to me too dearely deare.  
>    O what of Gods then boots it to be borne,  
>    If old *Aveugles* sonnes so euill heare?  
>    Or who shall not great *Nightes* children scorne,  
> When two of three her Nephews are so fowle forlorne?
>
> Vp then, vp dreary Dame, of darknesse Queene,  
>    Go gather vp the reliques of thy race,  
>    Or else goe them auenge, and let be seene,  
>    That dreaded *Night* in brightest day hath place,  
>    And can the children of faire light deface.  
>    Her feeling speeches some compassion moued  
>    In hart, and chaunge in that great mothers face:  
>    Yet pittie in her hart was neuer proued  
> Till then: for euermore she hated, neuer loued.
>
> And said, Deare daughter rightly may I rew  
>    The fall of famous children borne of mee,  
>    And good successes, which their foes ensew:  
>    But who can turne the streame of destinee,  
>    Or breake the chayne of strong necessitee,  
>    Which fast is tyde to *Ioues* eternall seat?  
>    The sonnes of Day he fauoureth, I see,  
>    And by my ruines thinkes to make them great:  
> To make one great by others losse, is bad excheat.
>
> Yet shall they not escape so freely all;  
>    For some shall pay the price of others guilt:  
>    And he the man that made *Sansfoy* to fall,  
>    Shall with his owne bloud price that he hath spilt.  
>    But what art thou, that telst of Nephews kilt?  
>    I that do seeme not I, *Duessa* am,  
>    (Quoth she) how euer now in garments gilt,  
>    And gorgeous gold arayd I to thee came;  
> *Duessa* I, the daughter of Deceipt and Shame.
>
> Then bowing downe her aged backe, she kist  
>    The wicked witch, saying; In that faire face  
>    The false resemblance of Deceipt, I wist  
>    Did closely lurke; yet so true-seeming grace  
>    It carried, that I scarse in darkesome place  
>    Could it discerne, though I the mother bee  
>    Of falshood, and root of *Duessaes* race.  
>    O welcome child, whom I haue longd to see,  
> And how haue seene vnwares. Lo now I go with thee.
>
> Then to her yron wagon she betakes,  
>    And with her beares the fowle welfauourd witch:  
>    Through mirkesome aire her readie way she makes.  
>    Her twyfold Teme, of which two blacke as pitch,  
>    And two were browne, yet each to each vnlich,  
>    Did softly swim away, ne euer stampe,  
>    Vnlesse she chaunst their stubborne mouths to twitch;    
> Then foming tarre, their bridles they would champe,  
> And trampling the fine element, would fiercely rampe.
>
> So well they sped, that they be come at length  
>    Vnto the place, whereas the Paynim lay,  
>    Deuoid of outward sense, and natiue strength,  
>    Couerd with charmed cloud from vew of day,  
>    And sight of men, since his late luckelesse fray.  
>    His cruell wounds with cruddy bloud congealed,  
>    They binden vp so wisely, as they may,  
>    And handle softly, till they can be healed:  
> So lay him in her charet, close in night concealed.
>
> And all the while she stood vpon the ground,  
>    The wakefull dogs did neuer cease to bay,  
>    As giuing warning of th'vnwonted sound,  
>    With which her yron wheeles did them affray,  
>    And her darke griesly looke them much dismay;  
>    The messenger of death, the ghastly Owle  
>    With drearie shriekes did also her bewray;  
>    And hungry Wolues continually did howle,  
> At her abhorred face, so filthy and so fowle.
>
> Thence turning backe in silence soft they stole,  
>    And brought the heauie corse with easie pace  
>    To yawning gulfe of deepe *Auernus* hole.  
>    By that same hole an entrance darke and bace  
>    With smoake and sulphure hiding all the place,  
>    Descends to hell: there creature neuer past,  
>    That backe returned without heauenly grace;  
>    But dreadfull *Furies*, which their chaines haue brast,  
> And damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast.
>
> By that same way the direfull dames doe driue  
>    Their mournefull charet, fild with rusty blood,  
>    And downe to *Plutoes* house are come biliue:  
>    Which passing through, on euery side them stood  
>    The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood,  
>    Chattring their yron teeth, and staring wide  
>    With stonie eyes; and all the hellish brood  
>    Of feends infernall flockt on euery side,  
> To gaze on earthly wight, that with the Night durst ride.
>
> They pas the bitter waues of *Acheron*,  
>    Where many soules sit wailing woefully,  
>    And come to fiery flood of *Phlegeton*,  
>    Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry,  
>    And with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry,  
>    Cursing high *Ioue*, the which them thither sent.  
>    The house of endlesse paine is built thereby,  
>    In which ten thousand sorts of punishment  
> The cursed creatures doe eternally torment.
>
> Before the threshold dreadfull *Cerberus*  
>    His three deformed heads did lay along,  
>    Curled with thousand adders venemous,  
>    And lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong:  
>    At them he gan to reare his bristles strong,  
>    And felly gnarre, vntill dayes enemy  
>    Did him appease; then downe his taile he hong  
>    And suffered them to passen quietly:  
> For she in hell and heauen had power equally.
>
> There was *Ixion* turned on a wheele,  
>    For daring tempt the Queene of heauen to sin;  
>    And *Sisyphus* an huge round stone did reele  
>    Against an hill, ne might from labour lin;  
>    There thirstie *Tantalus* hong by the chin;  
>    And *Tityus* fed a vulture on his maw;  
>    *Typhoeus* ioynts were stretched on a gin,  
>    *Theseus* condemned to endlesse slouth by law,  
> And fifty sisters water in leake vessels draw.
>
> They all beholding worldly wights in place,  
>    Leaue off their worke, vnmindfull of their smart,  
>    To gaze on them; who forth by them doe pace,  
>    Till they be come vnto the furthest part:  
>    Where was a Caue ywrought by wondrous art,  
>    Deepe, darke, vneasie, dolefull, comfortlesse,  
>    In which sad *Æsculapius* farre a part  
>    Emprisond was in chaines remedilesse,  
> For that *Hippolytus* rent corse he did redresse.
>
> *Hippolytus* a iolly huntsman was,  
>    That wont in charet chace the foming Bore;  
>    He all his Peeres in beautie did surpas,  
>    But Ladies loue as losse of time forbore:  
>    His wanton stepdame loued him the more,  
>    But when she saw her offred sweets refused  
>    Her loue she turnd to hate, and him before  
>    His father fierce of treason false accused,  
> And with her gealous termes his open eares abused.
>
> Who all in rage his Sea-god syre besought,  
>    Some cursed vengeance on his sonne to cast:  
>    From surging gulf two monsters straight were brought,  
>    With dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast,  
>    Both charet swift and huntsman ouercast.  
>    His goodly corps on ragged cliffs yrent,  
>    Was quite dismembred, and his members chast  
>    Scattered on euery mountaine, as he went,  
> That of *Hippolytus* was left no moniment.
>
> His cruell stepdame seeing what was donne,  
>    Her wicked dayes with wretched knife did end,  
>    In death auowing th'innocence of her sonne.  
>    Which hearing his rash Syre, began to rend  
>    His haire, and hastie tongue, that did offend:  
>    Tho gathering vp the relicks of his smart  
>    By *Dianes* meanes, who was *Hippolyts* frend,  
>    Them brought to *Æsculape*, that by his art  
> Did heale them all againe, and ioyned euery part.
>
> Such wondrous science in mans wit to raine  
>    When *Ioue* auizd, that could the dead reuiue,  
>    And fates expired could renew againe,  
>    Of endlesse life he might him not depriue,

>    Where long remaining, he did alwaies striue  
>    Himselfe wilth salues to health for to restore,  
> And slake the heauenly fire, that raged euermore.
>
> There auncient Night arriuing, did alight  
>    From her nigh wearie waine, and in her armes  
>    To *Æsculapius* brought the wounded knight:  
>    Whom hauing softly disarayd of armes,

> Ah Dame (quoth he) thou temptest me in vaine,

> Not so (quoth she) but sith that heauens king

> Who after *Archimagoes* fowle defeat,

> And turning wrathfull fire to lustfull heat,  
> With beastly sin thought her to haue defilde,

>
> With fawning wordes he courted her a while,  
> And looking louely, and oft sighing sore,

> She more amaz'd, in double dread doth dwell;

> Such fearefull fit assaid her trembling hart,

> Their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad,  
> And rusticke horror all a side doe lay,  
> And gently grenning, shew a semblance glad  
> To comfort her, and feare to put away,  
> Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay.
>
> The doubtfull Damzell dare not yet commit  
> Her single person to their barbarous truth,  
> But still twixt feare and hope amazd does sit,  
> Late learnd what harme to hastie trust ensu'th,  
> They in compassion of her tender youth,

> Are wonne with pitty and vnwonted ruth,  
> And all prostrate vpon the lowly plaine,  
> Do kisse her feete, and fawne on her with count'nance faine.
>
> Their harts she ghesseth by their humble guise,  
> And yieldes her to extremitie of time;  
> So from the ground she fearelesse doth arise,  
> And walketh forth without suspect of crime:  
> They all as glad, as birdes of ioyous Prime,  
> Thence lead her forth, about her dauncing round,  
> Shouting, and singing all a shepheards ryme,  
> And with greene braunches strowing all the ground,  
> Do worship her, as Queene, with oliue girlond cround.
>
> And all the way their merry pipes they sound,  
> That all the woods with doubled Eccho ring,  
> And with their horned feet do weare the ground,  
> Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring.  
> So towards old *Syluanus* they her bring;  
> Who with the noyse awaked, commeth out,  
> To weet the cause, his weake steps gouerning,  
> And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout,  
> And with an yuie twyne his wast is girt about.
>
> Far off he wonders, what them makes so glad,  
> If *Bacchus* merry fruit they did inuent,

>
> The woodborne people fall before her flat,  
> And worship her as Goddesse of the wood;  
> And old *Syluanus* selfe bethinkes not, what  
> To thinke of wight so faire, but gazing stood,  
> In doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood;  
> Sometimes Dame *Venus* selfe he seemes to see,  
> But *Venus* neuer had so sober mood;

> But misseth bow, and shaftes, and buskins to her knee.
>
> By vew of her he ginneth to reuiue

> But pynd away in anguish and selfe-wild annoy.
>
> The wooddy Nymphes, faire *Hamadryades*

> And henceforth nothing faire, but her on earth they find.
>
> Glad of such lucke, the luckelesse lucky maid,

> During which time her gentle wit she plyes,

> It fortuned a noble warlike knight

> Plaine, faithfull, true, and enimy of shame,  
> And euer lou'd to fight for Ladies right,  
> But in vaine glorious frayes he litle did delight.
>
> A Satyres sonne yborne in forrest wyld,  
> By straunge aduenture as it did betyde,  
> And there begotten of a Lady myld,  
> Faire *Thyamis* the daughter of *Labryde*,

> To *Therion*, a loose vnruly swayne;  
> Who had more ioy to raunge the forrest wyde,  
> And chase the saluage beast with busie payne,  
> Then serue his Ladies loue, and wast in pleasures vayne.
>
> The forlorne mayd did with loues longing burne,  
> And could not lacke her louers company,  
> But to the wood she goes, to serue her turne,  
> And seeke her spouse, that from her still does fly,  
> And followes other game and venery:  
> A Satyre chaunst her wandring for to find,  
> And kindling coles of lust in brutish eye,  
> The loyall links of wedlocke did vnbind,  
> And made her person thrall vnto his beastly kind.
>
> So long in secret cabin there he held  
> Her captiue to his sensuall desire,  
> Till that with timely fruit her belly sweld,  
> And bore a boy vnto that saluage sire:  
> Then home he suffred her for to retire,  
> For ransome leauing him the late borne childe;  
> Whom till to ryper yeares he gan aspire,  
> He noursled vp in life and manners wilde,  
> Emongst wild beasts and woods, from lawes of men exilde.
>
> For all he taught the tender ymp, was but  
> To banish cowardize and bastard feare;  
> His trembling hand he would him force to put  
> Vpon the Lyon and the rugged Beare,  
> And from the she Beares teats her whelps to teare;  
> And eke wyld roring Buls he would him make  
> To tame, and ryde their backes not made to beare;  
> And the Robuckes in flight to ouertake,  
> That euery beast for feare of him did fly and quake.
>
> Thereby so fearelesse, and so fell he grew,  
> That his owne sire and maister of his guise  
> Did often tremble at his horrid vew,  
> And oft for dread of hurt would him aduise,  
> The angry beasts not rashly to despise,  
> Nor too much to prouoke; for he would learne  
> The Lyon stoup to him in lowly wise,  
> (A lesson hard) and make the Libbard sterne  
> Leaue roaring, when in rage he for reuenge did earne.
>
> And for to make his powre approued more,  
> Wyld beasts in yron yokes he would compell;  
> The spotted Panther, and the tusked Bore,  
> The Pardale swift, and the Tigre cruell;  
> The Antelope, and Wolfe both fierce and fell;  
> And them constraine in equall teme to draw.  
> Such ioy he had, their stubborne harts to quell,  
> And sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw,  
> That his beheast they feared, as tyrans law,
>
> His louing mother came vpon a day  
> Vnto the woods, to see her little sonne;  
> And chaunst vnwares to meet him in the way,  
> After his sportes, and cruell pastime donne,  
> When after him a Lyonesse did runne,  
> That roaring all with rage, did lowd requere  
> Her children deare, whom he away had wonne:  
> The Lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare,  
> And lull in rugged armes, withouten childish feare.
>
> The fearefull Dame all quaked at the sight,  
> And turning backe, gan fast to fly away,  
> Vntill with loue reuokt from vaine affright,  
> She hardly yet perswaded was to stay,  
> And then to him these womanish words gan say;  
> Ah *Satyrane*, my dearling, and my ioy,  
> For loue of me leaue off this dreadfull play;  
> To dally thus with death, is no fit toy,  
> Go find some other play-fellowes, mine own sweet boy.
>
> In these and like delights of bloudy game  
> He trayned was, till ryper yeares he raught,  
> And there abode, whilst any beast of name  
> Walkt in that forest, whom he had not taught  
> To feare his force: and then his courage haught  
> Desird of forreine foemen to be knowne,  
> And far abroad for straunge aduentures sought:  
> In which his might was neuer ouerthrowne,  
> But through all Faery lond his famous worth was blown.
>
> Yet euermore it was his manner faire,  
> After long labours and aduentures spent,  
> Vnto those natiue woods for to repaire,  
> To see his sire and offspring auncient.  
> And now he thither came for like intent;  
> Where he vnwares the fairest *Vna* found,  
> Straunge Lady, in so straunge habiliment,  
> Teaching the Satyres, which her sat around,  
> Trew sacred lore, which from her sweet lips did redound.
>
> He wondred at her wisedome heauenly rare,  
> Whose like in womens wit he neuer knew;  
> And when her curteous deeds he did compare,  
> Gan her admire, and her sad sorrowes rew,  
> Blaming of Fortune, which such troubles threw,  
> And ioyd to make proofe of her crueltie  
> On gentle Dame, so hurtlesse, and so trew:  
> Thenceforth he kept her goodly company,  
> And learnd her discipline of faith and veritie.
>
> But she all vowd vnto the *Redcrosse* knight,  
> His wandring perill closely did lament,  
> Ne in this new acquaintaunce could delight,  
> But her deare heart with anguish did torment,  
> And all her wit in secret counsels spent,  
> How to escape. At last in priuie wise  
> To *Satyrane* she shewed her intent:  
> Who glad to gain such fauour, gan deuise,  
> How with that pensiue Maid he best might thence arise.
>
> So on a day when Satyres all were gone,  
> To do their seruice to *Syluanus* old,  
> The gentle virgin left behind alone  
> He led away with courage stout and bold.  
> Too late it was, to Satyres to be told,  
> Or euer hope recouer her againe:  
> In vaine he seekes that hauing cannot hold.  
> So fast he carried her with carefull paine,  
> That they the woods are past, & come now to the plaine.
>
> The better part now of the lingring day,  
> They traueild had, when as they farre espide  
> A wearie wight forwandring by the way,  
> And towards him they gan in hast to ride,  
> To weet of newes, that did abroad betide,  
> Or tydings of her knight of the *Redcrosse*.  
> But he them spying, gan to turne aside,  
> For feare as seemd, or for some feigned losse;  
> More greedy they of newes, fast towards him do crosse.
>
> A silly man, in simple weedes forworne,  
> And soild with dust of the long dried way;  
> His sandales were with toilesome trauell torne,  
> And face all tand with scorching sunny ray,  
> As he had traueild many a sommers day,  
> Through boyling sands of *Arabie* and *Ynde*;  
> And in his hand a *Iacobs* staffe, to stay  
> His wearie limbes vpon: and eke behind,  
> His scrip did hang, in which his needments he did bind.
>
> The knight approching nigh, of him inquerd  
> Tydings of warre, and of aduentures new;  
> But warres, nor new aduentures none he herd.  
> Then *Vna* gan to aske, if ought he knew,  
> Or heard abroad of that her champion trew,  
> That in his armour bare a croslet red.  
> Aye me, Deare dame (quoth he) well may I rew  
> To tell the sad sight, which mine eies haue red:  
> These eyes did see that knight both liuing and eke ded.
>
> That cruell word her tender hart so thrild,  
> That suddein cold did runne through euery vaine,  
> And stony horrour all her sences fild  
> With dying fit, that downe she fell for paine.  
> The knight her lightly reared vp againe,  
> And comforted with curteous kind reliefe:  
> Then wonne from death, she bad him tellen plaine  
> The further processe of her hidden griefe;  
> The lesser pangs can beare, who hath endur'd the chiefe.
>
> Then gan the Pilgrim thus, I chaunst this day,  
> This fatall day, that shall I euer rew,  
> To see two knights in trauell on my way  
> (A sory sight) arraung'd in battell new,  
> Both breathing vengeaunce, both of wrathfull hew:  
> My fearefull flesh did tremble at their strife,  
> To see their blades so greedily imbrew,  
> That drunke with bloud, yet thristed after life:  
> What more? the *Redcrosse* knight was slaine with Paynim knife.
>
> Ah dearest Lord (quoth she) how might that bee,  
> And he the stoutest knight, that euer wonne?  
> Ah dearest dame (quoth he) how might I see  
> The thing, that might not be, and yet was donne?  
> Where is (said *Satyrane*) that Paynims sonne,  
> That him of life, and vs of ioy hath reft?  
> Not far away (quoth he) he hence doth wonne  
> Foreby a fountaine, where I late him left  
> Washing his bloudy wounds, that through the steele were cleft.
>
> Therewith the knight thence marched forth in hast,  
> Whiles *Vna* with huge heauinesse opprest,  
> Could not for sorrow follow him so fast;  
> And soone he came, as he the place had ghest,  
> Whereas that *Pagan* proud him selfe did rest,  
> In secret shadow by a fountaine side:  
> Euen he it was, that earst would haue supprest  
> Faire *Vna*: whom when *Satyrane* espide,  
> With fowle reprochfull words he boldly him defide.
>
> And said, Arise thou cursed Miscreaunt,  
> That hast with knightlesse guile and trecherous train  
> Faire knighthood fowly shamed, and doest vaunt  
> That good knight of the *Redcrosse* to haue slain:  
> Arise, and with like treason now maintain  
> Thy guilty wrong, or else thee guilty yield.  
> The Sarazin this hearing, rose amain,  
> And catching vp in hast his three square shield,  
> And shining helmet, soone him buckled to the field.
>
> And drawing nigh him said, Ah misborne Elfe,  
> In euill houre thy foes thee hither sent,  
> Anothers wrongs to wreake vpon thy selfe:  
> Yet ill thou blamest me, for hauing blent  
> My name with guile and traiterous intent;  
> That *Redcrosse* knight, perdie, I neuer slew,  
> But had he beene, where earst his armes were lent,  
> Th'enchaunter vaine his errour should not rew:  
> But thou his errour shalt, I hope now prouen trew.
>
> Therewith they gan, both furious and fell,  
> To thunder blowes, and fiersly to assaile  
> Each other bent his enimy to quell,  
> That with their force they perst both plate and maile,  
> And made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile,  
> That it would pitty any liuing eie.  
> Large floods of bloud adowne their sides did raile;  
> But floods of bloud could not them satisfie:  
> Both hungred after death: both chose to win, or die.
>
> So long they fight, and fell reuenge pursue,  
> That fainting each, themselues to breathen let,  
> And oft refreshed, battell oft renue:  
> As when two Bores with rancling malice met,  
> Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret,  
> Til breathlesse both them selues aside retire,  
> Where foming wrath, their cruell tuskes they whet,  
> And trample th'earth, the whiles they may respire;  
> Then backe to fight againe, new breathed and entire.
>
> So fiersly, when these knights had breathed once,  
> They gan to fight returne, increasing more  
> Their puissant force, and cruell rage attonce,  
> With heaped strokes more hugely, then before,  
> That with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore  
> They both deformed, scarsely could be known.  
> By this sad *Vna* fraught with anguish sore,  
> Led with their noise, which through the aire was thrown:  
> Arriu'd, where they in erth their fruitles bloud had sown.
>
> Whom all so soone as that proud Sarazin  
> Espide, he gan reuiue the memory  
> Of his lewd lusts, and late attempted sin,  
> And left the doubtfull battell hastily,  
> To catch her, newly offred to his eie:  
> But *Satyrane* with strokes him turning, staid,  
> And sternely bad him other businesse plie,  
> Then hunt the steps of pure vnspotted Maid:  
> Wherewith he all enrag'd, these bitter speaches said.
>
> O foolish faeries sonne, what furie mad  
> Hath thee incenst, to hast thy dolefull fate?  
> Were it not better, I that Lady had,  
> Then that thou hadst repented it too late?  
> Most sencelesse man he, that himselfe doth hate,  
> To loue another. Lo then for thine ayd  
> Here take thy louers token on thy pate.  
> So they to fight; the whiles the royall Mayd  
> Fled farre away, of that proud Paynim sore afrayd.
>
> But that false *Pilgrim*, which that leasing told,  
> Being in deed old *Archimage*, did stay  
> In secret shadow, all this to behold,  
> And much reioyced in their bloudy fray:  
> But when he saw the Damsell passe away  
> He left his stond, and her pursewd apace,  
> In hope to bring her to her last decay.  
> But for to tell her lamentable cace,  
> And eke this battels end, will need another place.
