*Cant. IIII.*

> *Artegall dealeth right betwixt  
> two brethren that doe strive,  
> Saues Terpine from the gallow tree,  
> and doth from death repriue.*

> VV Ho so vpon him selfe will take the skill  
> True Iustice vnto people to diuide,  
> Had neede haue mightie hands, for to fulfill  
> That, which he doth with righteous doome decide,  
> And for to maister wrong and puissant pride,  
> For vaine it is to deeme of things aright,  
> And makes wrong doers iustice to deride,  
> Vnlesse it be perform'd with dreadlesse might.  
> For powre is the right hand of Iustice truely hight.
>
> Therefore whylome to knights of great emprise  
> The charge of Iustice giuen was in trust,  
> That they might execute her iudgements wise,  
> And with their might beat downe licentious lust,  
> Which proudly did impugne her sentence iust.  
> Whereof no brauer president this day  
> Remaines on earth, preseru'd from yron rust  
> Of rude obliuion, and long times decay,  
> Then this of *Artegall*, which here we haue to say.
>
> Who hauing lately left that louely payre,  
> Enlincked fast in wedlockes loyall bond,  
> Bold *Marinell* with *Florimell* the fayre,  
> With whom great feast and goodly glee he fond,  
> Departed from the Castle of the strond,  
> To follow his aduentures first intent,  
> Which long agoe he taken had in hond:  
> Ne wight with him for his assistance went,  
> But that great yron groome, his gard and gouernment.
>
> With whom as he did passe by the sea shore,  
> He chaunst to come, whereas two comely Squires,  
> Both brethren, whom one wombe together bore,  
> But stirred vp with different desires,  
> Together stroue, and kindled wrathfull fires:  
> And them beside two seemely damzels stood,  
> By all meanes seeking to asswage their ires,  
> Now with faire words; but words did little good,  
> Now with sharpe threats; but threats the more increast their mood.
>
> And there before them stood a Coffer strong,  
> Fast bound on euery side with iron bands,  
> But seeming to haue suffred mickle wrong,  
> Either by being wreckt vppon the sands,  
> Or being carried farre from forraine lands.  
> Seem'd that for it these Squires at ods did fall,  
> And bent against them selues their cruell hands.  
> But euermore, those Damzels did forestall  
> Their furious encounter, and their fiercenesse pall.
>
> But firmely fixt they were, with dint of sword,  
> And battailes doubtfull proofe their rights to try,  
> Ne other end their fury would afford,  
> But what to them Fortune would iustify.  
> So stood they both in readinesse thereby,  
> To ioyne the combate with cruell intent;  
> When *Artegall* arriuing happily,  
> Did stay a while their greedy bickerment,  
> Till he had questioned the cause of their dissent.
>
> To whom the elder did this aunswere frame;  
> Then weete ye Sir, that we two brethren be,  
> To whom our sire, *Milesio* by name,  
> Did equally bequeath his lands in fee,  
> Two Ilands, which ye there before you see  
> Not farre in sea; of which the one appeares  
> But like a little Mount of small degree;  
> Yet was as great and wide ere many yeares,  
> As that same other Isle, that greater bredth now beares.
>
> But tract of time, that all things doth decay,  
> And this deuouring Sea, that naught doth spare,  
> The most part of my land hath washt away,  
> And throwne it vp vnto my brothers share:  
> So his encreased, but mine did empaire.  
> Before which time I lou'd, as was my lot,  
> That further mayd, hight *Philtera* the faire,  
> With whom a goodly doure I should haue got,  
> And should haue ioyned bene to her in wedlocks knot.
>
> Then did my younger brother *Amidas*  
> Loue that same other Damzell, *Lucy* bright,  
> To whom but little dowre allotted was;  
> Her vertue was the dowre, that did delight.  
> What better dowre can to a dame be hight?  
> But now when *Philtra* saw my lands decay,  
> And former liuelod fayle, she left me quight,  
> And to my brother did ellope streight way:  
> Who taking her from me, his owne loue left astray.
>
> She seeing then her selfe forsaken so,  
> Through dolorous despaire, which she conceyued,  
> Into the Sea her selfe did headlong throw,  
> Thinking to haue her griefe by death bereaued.  
> But see how much her purpose was deceaued.  
> Whilest thus amidst the billowes beating of her  
> Twixt life and death, long to and fro she weaued,  
> She chaunst vnwares to light vppon this coffer,  
> Which to her in that daunger hope of life did offer.
>
> The wretched mayd that earst desir'd to die,  
> When as the paine of death she tasted had,  
> And but halfe seene his vgly visnomie,  
> Gan to repent, that she had beene so mad,  
> For any death to chaunge life though most bad:  
> And catching hold of this Sea-beaten chest,  
> The lucky Pylot of her passage sad,  
> After long tossing in the seas distrest,  
> Her weary barke at last vppon mine Isle did rest.
>
> Where I by chaunce then wandring on the shore,  
> Did her espy, and through my good endeuour  
> From dreadfull mouth of death, which threatned sore  
> Her to haue swallow'd vp, did helpe to saue her.  
> She then in recompence of that great fauour,  
> Which I on her bestowed, bestowed on me  
> The portion of that good, which Fortune gaue her,  
> Together with her selfe in dowry free;  
> Both goodly portions, but of both the better she.
>
> Yet in this coffer, which she with her brought,  
> Great threasure sithence we did finde contained;  
> Which as our owne we tooke, and so it thought.  
> But this same other Damzell since hath fained,  
> That to her selfe that threasure appertained;  
> And that she did transport the same by sea,  
> To bring it to her husband new ordained,  
> But suffred cruell shipwracke by the way.  
> But whether it be so or no, I can not say.
>
> But whether it indeede be so or no,  
> This doe I say, that what so good or ill  
> Or God or Fortune vnto me did throw,  
> Not wronging any other by my will,  
> I hold mine owne, and so will hold it still.  
> And though my land he first did winne away,  
> And then my loue (though now it little skill,)  
> Yet my good lucke he shall not likewise pray;  
> But I will it defend, whilst euer that I may.
>
> So hauing sayd, the younger did ensew;  
> Full true it is, what so about our land  
> My brother here declared hath to you:  
> But not for it this ods twixt vs doth stand,  
> But for this threasure throwne vppon his strand;  
> Which well I proue, as shall appeare by triall,  
> To be this maides, with whom I fastned hand,  
> Known by good markes, and perfect good espiall,  
> Therefore it ought be rendred her without deniall.
>
> When they thus ended had, the Knight began;  
> Certes your strife were easie to accord,  
> Would ye remit it to some righteous man.  
> Vnto your selfe, said they, we giue our word,  
> To bide what iudgement ye shall vs afford.  
> Then for assuraunce to my doome to stand,  
> Vnder my foote let each lay downe his sword,  
> And then you shall my sentence vnderstand.  
> So each of them layd downe his sword out of his hand.
>
> Then *Artegall* thus to the younger sayd;  
> Now tell me *Amidas*, if that ye may,  
> Your brothers land the which the sea hath layd  
> Vnto your part, and pluckt from his away,  
> By what good right doe you withhold this day?  
> What other right (quoth he) should you esteeme,  
> But that the sea it to my share did lay?  
> Your right is good (sayd he) and so I deeme,  
> That what the sea vnto you sent, your own should seeme.
>
> Then turning to the elder thus he sayd;  
> Now *Bracidas* let this likewise be showne.  
> Your brothers threasure, which from him is strayd,  
> Being the dowry of his wife well knowne,  
> By what right doe you claime to be your owne?  
> What other right (quoth he) should you esteeme,  
> But that the sea hath it vnto me throwne?  
> Your right is good (sayd he) and so I deeme,  
> That what the sea vnto you sent, your own should seeme.
>
> For equall right in equall things doth stand,  
> For what the mighty Sea hath once possest,  
> And plucked quite from all possessors hand,  
> Whether by rage of waues, that neuer rest,  
> Or else by wracke, that wretches hath distrest,  
> He may dispose by his imperiall might,  
> As thing at randon left, to whom he list.  
> So *Amidas*, the land was yours first hight,  
> And so the threasure yours is *Bracidas* by right.
>
> When he his sentence thus pronounced had,  
> Both *Amidas* and *Philtra* were displeased:  
> But *Bracidas* and *Lucy* were right glad,  
> And on the threasure by that iudgement seased.  
> So was their discord by this doome appeased,  
> And each one had his right. Then *Artegall*  
> When as their sharpe contention he had ceased,  
> Departed on his way, as did befall,  
> To follow his old quest, the which him forth did call.
>
> So as he trauelled vppon the way,  
> He chaunst to come, where happily he spide  
> A rout of many people farre away;  
> To whom his course he hastily applide,  
> To weete the cause of their assemblaunce wide.  
> To whom when he approched neare in sight,  
> (An vncouth sight) he plainely then descride  
> To be a troupe of women warlike dight,  
> With weapons in their hands, as ready for to fight.
>
> And in the midst of them he saw a Knight,  
> With both his hands behinde him pinnoed hard,  
> And round about his necke an halter tight,  
> As ready for the gallow tree prepard:  
> His face was couered, and his head was bar'd,  
> That who he was, vneath was to descry;  
> And with full heauy heart with them he far'd,  
> Grieu'd to the soule, and groning inwardly,  
> That he of womens hands so base a death should dy.
>
> But they like tyrants, mercilesse the more,  
> Reioyced at his miserable case,  
> And him reuiled, and reproched sore  
> With bitter taunts, and termes of vile disgrace.  
> Now when as *Artegall* arriu'd in place,  
> Did aske, what cause brought that man to decay,  
> They round about him gan to swarme apace,  
> Meaning on him their cruell hands to lay,  
> And to haue wrought vnwares some villanous assay.
>
> But he was soone aware of their ill minde,  
> And drawing backe deceiued their intent;  
> Yet though him selfe did shame on womankinde  
> His mighty hand to shend, he *Talus* sent  
> To wrecke on them their follies hardyment:  
> Who with few sowces of his yron flale,  
> Dispersed all their troupe incontinent,  
> And sent them home to tell a piteous tale,  
> Of their vaine prowesse, turned to their proper bale.
>
> But that same wretched man, ordaynd to die,  
> They left behind them, glad to be so quit:  
> Him *Talus* tooke out of perplexitie,  
> And horrour of fowle death for Knight vnfit,  
> Who more then losse of life ydreaded it;  
> And him restoring vnto liuing light,  
> So brought vnto his Lord, where he did sit,  
> Beholding all that womanish weake fight;  
> Whom soone as he beheld, he knew, and thus behight.
>
> Sir *Terpine*, haplesse man, what make you here?  
> Or haue you lost your selfe, and your discretion,  
> That euer in this wretched case ye were?  
> Or haue ye yeelded you to proude oppression  
> Of womens powre, that boast of mens subiection?  
> Or else what other deadly dismall day  
> Is falne on you, by heauens hard direction,  
> That ye were runne so fondly far astray,  
> As for to lead your selfe vnto your owne decay?
>
> Much was the man confounded in his mind,  
> Partly with shame, and partly with dismay,  
> That all astonisht he him selfe did find,  
> And little had for his excuse to say,  
> But onely thus; Most haplesse well ye may  
> Me iustly terme, that to this shame am brought,  
> And made the scorne of Knighthod this same day.  
> But who can scape, what his owne fate hath wrought?  
> The worke of heauens will surpasseth humaine thought.
>
> Right true: but faulty men vse oftentimes  
> To attribute their folly vnto fate,  
> And lay on heauen the guilt of their owne crimes.  
> But tell, Sir *Terpin*, ne let you amate  
> Your misery, how fell ye in this state.  
> Then sith ye needs (quoth he) will know my shame,  
> And all the ill, which chaunst to me of late,  
> I shortly will to you rehearse the same,  
> In hope ye will not turne misfortune to my blame
>
> Being desirous (as all Knights are woont)  
> Through hard aduentures deedes of armes to try,  
> And after fame and honour for to hunt,  
> I heard report that farre abrode did fly,  
> That a proud Amazon did late defy  
> All the braue Knights, that hold of Maidenhead,  
> And vnto them wrought all the villany,  
> That she could forge in her malicious head,  
> Which some hath put to shame, and many done be dead.
>
> The cause, they say, of this her cruell hate,  
> Is for the sake of *Bellodant* the bold,  
> To whom she bore most feruent loue of late,  
> And wooed him by all the waies she could:  
> But when she saw at last, that he ne would  
> For ought or nought be wonne vnto her will,  
> She turn'd her loue to hatred manifold,  
> And for his sake vow'd to doe all the ill  
> Which she could doe to Knights, which now she doth fulfill.
>
> For all those Knights, the which by force or guile  
> She doth subdue, she fowly doth entreate.  
> First she doth them of warlike armes despoile,  
> And cloth in womens weedes: And then with threat  
> Doth them compell to worke, to earne their meat,  
> To spin, to card, to sew, to wash, to wring;  
> Ne doth she giue them other thing to eat,  
> But bread and water, or like feeble thing,  
> Them to disable from reuenge aduenturing.
>
> But if through stout disdaine of manly mind,  
> Any her proud obseruaunce will withstand,  
> Vppon that gibbet, which is there behind,  
> She causeth them be hang'd vp out of hand;  
> In which condition I right now did stand.  
> For being ouercome by her in fight,  
> And put to that base seruice of her band,  
> I rather chose to die in liues despight,  
> Then lead that shamefull life, vnworthy of a Knight.
>
> How hight that Amazon (sayd *Artegall?*)  
> And where, and how far hence does she abide?  
> Her name (quoth he) they *Radigund* doe call,  
> A Princesse of great powre, and greater pride,  
> And Queene of Amazons, in armes well tride,  
> And sundry battels, which she hath atchieued  
> With great successe, that her hath glorifide,  
> And made her famous, more then is belieued;  
> Ne would I it haue ween'd, had I not late it prieued.
>
> Now sure (said he) and by the faith that I  
> To Maydenhead and noble knighthood owe,  
> I will not rest, till I her might doe trie,  
> And venge the shame, that she to Knights doth show.  
> Therefore Sir *Terpin* from you lightly throw  
> This squalid weede, the patterne of dispaire,  
> And wend with me, that ye may see and know,  
> How Fortune will your ruin'd name repaire,  
> And knights of Maidenhead, whose praise she would empaire.
>
> With that, like one that hopelesse was repryu'd  
> From deathes dore, at which he lately lay,  
> Those yron fetters, wherewith he was gyu'd,  
> The badges of reproch, he threw away,  
> And nimbly did him dight to guide the way  
> Vnto the dwelling of that Amazone.  
> Which was from thence not past a mile or tway:  
> A goodly citty and a mighty one,  
> The which of her owne name she called *Radigone*.
>
> Where they arriuing, by the watchmen were  
> Descried streight; who all the citty warned,  
> How that three warlike persons did appeare,  
> Of which the one him seem'd a Knight all armed,  
> And th'other two well likely to haue harmed.  
> Eftsoones the people all to harnesse ran,  
> And like a sort of Bees in clusters swarmed:  
> Ere long their Queene her selfe, halfe like a man  
> Came forth into the rout, and them t'array began.
>
> And now the Knights being arriued neare,  
> Did beat vppon the gates to enter in,  
> And at the Porter, skorning them so few,  
> Threw many threats, if they the towne did win,  
> To teare his flesh in peeces for his sin.  
> Which when as *Radigund* there comming heard,  
> Her heart for rage did grate, and teeth did grin:  
> She bad that streight the gates should be vnbard,  
> And to them way to make, with weapons well prepard.
>
> Soone as the gates were open to them set,  
> They pressed forward, entraunce to haue made.  
> But in the middle way they were ymet  
> With a sharpe showre of arrowes, which them staid,  
> And better bad aduise, ere they assaid  
> Vnknowen perill of bold womens pride.  
> Then all that rout vppon them rudely laid,  
> And heaped strokes so fast on euery side,  
> And arrowes haild so thicke, that they could not abide.
>
> But *Radigund* her selfe, when she espide  
> Sir *Terpin*, from her direfull doome acquit,  
> So cruell doale amongst her maides dauide,  
> T'auenge that shame, they did on him commit;  
> All sodainely enflam'd with furious fit,  
> Like a fell Lionesse at him she flew,  
> And on his head-peece him so fiercely smit,  
> That to the ground him quite she ouerthrew,  
> Dismayd so with the stroke, that he no colours knew.
>
> Soone as she saw him on the ground to grouell,  
> She lightly to him leapt, and in his necke  
> Her proud foote setting, at his head did leuell,  
> Weening at once her wrath on him to wreake,  
> And his contempt, that did her iudg'ment breake.  
> As when a Beare hath seiz'd her cruell clawes  
> Vppon the carkasse of some beast too weake,  
> Proudly stands ouer, and a while doth pause,  
> To heare the piteous beast pleading her plaintiffe cause.
>
> Whom when as *Artegall* in that distresse  
> By chaunce beheld, he left the bloudy slaughter,  
> In which he swam, and ranne to his redresse.  
> There her assayling fiercely fresh, he raught her  
> Such an huge stroke, that it of sence distraught her:  
> And had she not it warded warily,  
> It had depriu'd her mother of a daughter.  
> Nathlesse for all the powre she did apply,  
> It made her stagger oft, and stare with ghastly eye.
>
> Like to an Eagle in his kingly pride,  
> Soring through his wide Empire of the aire,  
> To weather his brode sailes, by chaunce hath spide  
> A Goshauke, which hath seized for her share  
> Vppon some fowle, that should her feast prepare;  
> With dreadfull force he flies at her byliue,  
> That with his souce, which none enduren dare,  
> Her from the quarrey he away doth driue,  
> And from her griping pounce the greedy prey doth riue.
>
> But soone as she her sence recouer'd had,  
> She fiercely towards him her selfe gan dight,  
> Through vengeful wrath & sdeignfull pride half mad:  
> For neuer had she suffred such despight.  
> But ere she could ioyne hand with him to fight,  
> Her warlike maides about her flockt so fast,  
> That they disparted them, maugre their might,  
> And with their troupes did far a sunder cast:  
> But mongst the rest the fight did vntill euening last.
>
> And euery while that mighty yron man,  
> With his strange weapon, neuer wont in warre,  
> Them sorely vext, and courst, and ouerran,  
> And broke their bowes, and did their shooting marre,  
> That none of all the many once did darre  
> Him to assault, nor once approach him nie,  
> But like a sort of sheepe dispersed farre  
> For dread of their deuouring enemie,  
> Through all the fields and vallies did before him flie.
>
> But when as daies faire shinie-beame, yclowded  
> With fearefull shadowes of deformed night,  
> Warn'd man and beast in quiet rest be shrowded,  
> Bold *Radigund* with sound of trumpe on hight,  
> Causd all her people to surcease from fight,  
> And gathering them vnto her citties gate,  
> Made them all enter in before her sight,  
> And all the wounded, and the weake in state,  
> To be conuayed in, ere she would once retrate.
>
> When thus the field was voided all away,  
> And all things quieted, the Elfin Knight  
> Weary of toile and trauell of that day,  
> Causd his pauilion to be richly pight  
> Before the city gate, in open sight;  
> Where he him selfe did rest in safety,  
> Together with sir *Terpin* all that night:  
> But *Talus* vsde in times of ieopardy  
> To keepe a nightly watch, for dread of treachery.
>
> But *Radigund* full of heart-gnawing griefe,  
> For the rebuke, which she sustain'd that day,  
> Could take no rest, ne would receiue reliefe,  
> But tossed in her troublous minde, what way  
> She mote reuenge that blot, which on her lay.  
> There she resolu'd her selfe in single fight  
> To try her Fortune, and his force assay,  
> Rather then see her people spoiled quight,  
> As she had seene that day a disauenterous sight.
>
> She called forth to her a trusty mayd,  
> Whom she thought fittest for that businesse,  
> Her name was *Clarin*, and thus to her sayd;  
> Goe damzell quickly, doe thy selfe addresse,  
> To doe the message, which I shall expresse.  
> Goe thou vnto that stranger Faery Knight,  
> Who yesterday droue vs to such distresse,  
> Tell, that to morrow I with him will fight,  
> And try in equall field, whether hath greater might.
>
> But these conditions doe to him propound,  
> That if I vanquishe him, he shall obay  
> My law, and euer to my lore be bound;  
> And so will I, if me he vanquish may,  
> What euer he shall like to doe or say.  
> Goe streight, and take with thee, to witnesse it,  
> Sixe of thy fellowes of the best array,  
> And beare with you both wine and iuncates fit,  
> And bid him eate, henceforth he oft shall hungry sit.
>
> The Damzell streight obayd, and putting all  
> In readinesse, forth to the Towne-gate went;  
> Where sounding loud a Trumpet from the wall,  
> Vnto those warlike Knights she warning sent.  
> Then *Talus* forth issuing from the tent,  
> Vnto the wall his way did fearelesse take,  
> To weeten what that trumpets sounding ment:  
> Where that same Damzell lowdly him bespake,  
> And shew'd, that with his Lord she would emparlaunce make.
>
> So he them streight conducted to his Lord,  
> Who, as he could, them goodly well did greete,  
> Till they had told their message word by word:  
> Which he accepting well, as he could weete,  
> Them fairely entertaynd with curt'sies meete,  
> And gaue them gifts and things of deare delight.  
> So backe againe they homeward turnd their feete.  
> But *Artegall* him selfe to rest did dight,  
> That he mote fresher be against the next daies fight.
