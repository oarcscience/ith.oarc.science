*Cant. X.*

> *Calidore sees the Graces daunce,  
> To Colins melody:  
> The whiles his Pastorell is led,  
> \[I\]nto captiuity.*

> W Ho now does follow the foule *Blatant Beast*,  
> Whilest *Calidore* does follow that faire Mayd,  
> Vnmyndfull of his vow and high beheast,  
> Which by the Faery Queene was on him layd,  
> That he should neuer leaue, nor be delayd  
> From chacing him, till he had it attchieued?  
> But now entrapt of loue, which him betrayd,  
> He mindeth more, how he may be relieued  
> With grace from her, whose loue his heart hath sore engrieued.
>
> That from henceforth he meanes no more to sew  
> His former quest, so full of toile and paine;  
> Another quest, another game in vew  
> He hath, the guerdon of his loue to gaine:  
> With whom he myndes for euer to remaine,  
> And set his rest amongst the rusticke sort,  
> Rather then hunt still after shadowes vaine  
> Of courtly fauour, fed with light report,  
> Of euery blaste, and sayling alwaies on the port.
>
> Ne certes mote he greatly blamed be,  
> From so high step to stoupe vnto so low.  
> For who had tasted once (as oft did he)  
> The happy peace, which there doth ouerflow,  
> And prou'd the perfect pleasures, which doe grow  
> Amongst poore hyndes, in hils, in woods, in dales,  
> Would neuer more delight in painted show  
> Of such false blisse, as there is set for stales,  
> T'entrap vnwary fooles in their eternall bales.
>
> For what hath all that goodly glorious gaze  
> Like to one sight, which *Calidore* did vew?  
> The glaunce whereof their dimmed eies would daze,  
> That neuer more they should endure the shew  
> Of that sunne-shine, that makes them looke askew.  
> Ne ought in all that world of beauties rare,  
> (Saue onely *Glorianaes* heauenly hew  
> To which what can compare?) can it compare;  
> The which as commeth now, by course I will declare.
>
> One day as he did raunge the fields abroad,  
> Whilest his faire *Pastorella* was elsewhere,  
> He chaunst to come, far from all peoples troad,  
> Vnto a place, whose pleasaunce did appere  
> To passe all others, on the earth which were:  
> For all that euer was by natures skill  
> Deuized to worke delight, was gathered there,  
> And there by her were poured forth at fill,  
> As if this to adorne, she all the rest did pill.
>
> It was an hill plaste in an open plaine,  
> That round about was bordered with a wood  
> Of matchlesse hight, that seem'd th'earth to disdaine;  
> In which all trees of honour stately stood,  
> And did all winter as in sommer bud,  
> Spredding pauilions for the birds to bowre,  
> Which in their lower braunches sung aloud;  
> And in their tops the soring hauke did towre,  
> Sitting like King of fowles in maiesty and powre.
>
> And at the foote thereof, a gentle flud  
> His siluer waues did softly tumble downe,  
> Vnmard with ragged mosse or filthy mud;  
> Ne mote wylde beastes, ne mote the ruder clowne  
> Thereto approch, ne filth mote therein drowne:  
> But Nymphes and Faeries by the bancks did sit,  
> In the woods shade, which did the waters crowne,  
> Keeping all noysome things away from it,  
> And to the waters fall tuning their accents fit.
>
> And on the top thereof a spacious plaine  
> Did spred it selfe, to serue to all delight,  
> Either to daunce, when they to daunce would faine,  
> Or else to course about their bases light;  
> Ne ought there wanted, which for pleasure might  
> Desired be, or thence to banish bale:  
> So pleasauntly the hill with equall hight,  
> Did seeme to ouerlooke the lowly vale;  
> Therefore it rightly cleeped was mount *Acidale*.
>
> They say that *Venus*, when she did dispose  
> Her selfe to pleasaunce, vsed to resort  
> Vnto this place, and therein to repose  
> And rest her selfe, as in a gladsome port,  
> Or with the Graces there to play and sport;  
> That euen her owne Cytheron, though in it  
> She vsed most to keepe her royall court,  
> And in her soueraine Maiesty to sit,  
> She in regard hereof refusde and thought vnfit.
>
> Vnto this place when as the Elfin Knight  
> Approcht, him seemed that the merry sound  
> Of a shrill pipe he playing heard on hight,  
> And many feete fast thumping th'hollow ground,  
> That through the woods their Eccho did rebound.  
> He nigher drew, to weete what mote it be;  
> There he a troupe of Ladies dauncing found  
> Full merrily, and making gladfull glee,  
> And in the midst a Shepheard piping he did see.
>
> He durst not enter into th'open greene,  
> For dread of them vnwares to be descryde,  
> For breaking of their daunce, if he were seene;  
> But in the couert of the wood did byde,  
> Beholding all, yet of them vnespyde.  
> There he did see, that pleased much his sight,  
> That euen he him selfe his eyes enuyde,  
> An hundred naked maidens lilly white,  
> All raunged in a ring, and dauncing in delight.
>
> All they without were raunged in a ring,  
> And daunced round ; but in the midst of them  
> Three other Ladies did both daunce and sing,  
> The whilest the rest them round about did hemme,  
> And like a girlond did in compasse stemme:  
> And in the middest of those same three, was placed  
> Another Damzell, as a precious gemme,  
> Amidst a ring most richly well enchaced,  
> That with her goodly presence all the rest much graced.
>
> Looke how the Crowne, which *Ariadne* wore  
> Vpon her yuory forehead that same day  
> That *Theseus* her vnto his bridale bore,  
> When the bold *Centaures* made that bloudy fray  
> With the fierce *Lapithes*, which did them dismay;  
> Being now placed in the firmament,  
> Through the bright heauen doth her beams display,  
> And is vnto the starres an ornament,  
> Which round about her moue in order excellent.
>
> Such was the beauty of this goodly band,  
> Whose sundry parts were here too long to tell:  
> But she that in the midst of them did stand,  
> Seem'd all the rest in beauty to excell,  
> Crownd with a rosie girlond, that right well  
> Did her beseeme. And euer, as the crew  
> About her daunst, sweet flowres, that far did smell,  
> And fragrant odours they vppon her threw;  
> But most of all, those three did her with gifts endew.
>
> Those were the Graces, daughters of delight,  
> Handmaides of *Venus*, which are wont to haunt  
> Vppon this hill, and daunce there day and night:  
> Those three to men all gifts of grace do graunt,  
> And all, that *Venus* in her selfe doth vaunt,  
> Is borrowed of them. But that faire one,  
> That in the midst was placed parauaunt,  
> Was she to whom that shepheard pypt alone,  
> That made him pipe so merrily, as neuer none.
>
> She was to weete that iolly Shepheards lasse,  
> Which piped there vnto that merry rout:  
> That iolly shepheard, which there piped, was  
> Poore *Colin Clout* (who knowes not *Colin Clout*?)  
> He pypt apace, whilest they him daunst about.  
> Pype iolly shepheard, pype thou now apace  
> Vnto thy loue, that made thee low to lout;  
> Thy Loue is present there with thee in place,  
> Thy Loue is there aduaunst to be another Grace.
>
> Much wondred *Calidore* at this straunge sight,  
> Whose like before his eye had neuer seene,  
> And standing long astonished in spright,  
> And rapt with pleasaunce, wist not what to weene;  
> Whether it were the traine of beauties Queene,  
> Or Nymphes, or Faeries, or enchaunted show,  
> With which his eyes mote haue deluded beene.  
> Therefore resoluing, what it was, to know,  
> Out of the wood he rose, and toward them did go.
>
> But soone as he appeared to their vew,  
> The vanisht all away out of his sight,  
> And cleane were gone, which way he neuer knew;  
> All saue the shepheard, who for fell despight  
> Of that displeasure, broke his bag-pipe quight,  
> And made great mone for that vnhappy turne.  
> But *Calidore*, though no lesse sory wight,  
> For that mishap, yet seeing him to mourne,  
> Drew neare, that he the truth of all by him mote learne.
>
> And first him greeting, thus vnto him spake;  
> Haile iolly shepheard, which thy ioyous dayes  
> Here leadest in this goodly merry make,  
> Frequented of these gentle Nymphes alwayes,  
> Which to thee flocke, to heare thy louely layes;  
> Tell me, what mote these dainty Damzels be,  
> Which here with thee doe make their pleasant playes?  
> Right happy thou, that mayst them freely see:  
> But why when I them saw, fled they away from me?
>
> Not I so happy, answerd then that swaine,  
> As thou vnhappy, which them thence didst chace,  
> Whom by no meanes thou canst recall againe;  
> For being gone, none can them bring in place,  
> But whom they of them selues list so to grace.  
> Right sory I, (saide then Sir *Calidore*,)  
> That my ill fortune did them hence displace.  
> But since things passed none may now restore,  
> Tell, me what were they all, whose lacke thee grieues so sore.
>
> Tho gan that shepheard thus for to dilate;  
> Then wote thou shepheard, whatsoeuer thou bee,  
> That all those Ladies, which thou sawest late,  
> Are *Venus* Damzels, all within her fee,  
> But differing in honour and degree:  
> They all are Graces, which on her depend,  
> Besides a thousand more, which ready bee  
> Her to adorne, when so she forth doth wend:  
> But those three in the midst, doe chiefe on her attend.
>
> They are the daughters of sky-ruling *Ioue*,  
> By him begot of faire *Eurynome*,  
> The Oceans daughter, in this pleasant groue,  
> As he this way comming from feastfull glee,  
> Of *Thetis* wedding with *Æacidee*,  
> In sommers shade himselfe here rested weary.  
> The first of them hight mylde *Euphrosyne*,  
> Next faire *Aglaia*, last *Thalia* merry:  
> Sweete Goddesses all three which me in mirth do cherry.
>
> These three on men all gracious gifts bestow,  
> Which decke to body or adorne the mynde,  
> To make them louely or well fauoured show,  
> As comely carriage, entertainement kynde,  
> Sweete semblaunt, friendly offices that bynde,  
> And all the complements of curtesie:  
> They teach vs, how to each degree and kynde  
> We should our selues demeane, to low, to hie;  
> To firends, to foes, which skill men call Ciuility.
>
> Therefore they alwaies smoothly seeme to smile,  
> That we likewise should mylde and gentle be,  
> And also naked are, that without guile  
> Or false dissemblaunce all them plaine may see,  
> Simple and true from couert malice free:  
> And eeke them selues so in their daunce they bore,  
> That two of them still fr\[ow\]ard seem'd to bee,  
> But one still towards shew'd her selfe afore;  
> That good should from vs goe, then come in greater store.
>
> Such were those Goddesses, which ye did see;  
> But that fourth Mayd, which there amidst thẽ traced,  
> Who can aread, what creature mote she bee,  
> Whether a creature, or a goddesse graced  
> With heauenly gifts from heuen first enraced?  
> But what so sure she was, she worthy was,  
> For be the fourth with those three other placed:  
> Yet was she certes but a countrey lasse,  
> Yet she all other countrey lasses farre did passe.
>
> So farre as doth the daughter of the day,  
> All other lesser lights in light excell,  
> So farre doth she in beautyfull array,  
> Aboue all other lasses beare the bell,  
> Ne lesse in vertue that beseemes her well,  
> Doth she exceede the rest of all her race;  
> For which the Graces that here wont to dwell,  
> Haue for more honor brought her to this place,  
> And graced her so much to be another Grace.
>
> Another Grace she well deserues to be,  
> In whom so many Graces gathered are,  
> Excelling much the meane of her degree;  
> Diuine resemblaunce, beauty soueraine rare,  
> Firme Chastity, that spight ne blemish dare;  
> All which she with such courtesie doth grace,  
> That all her peres cannot with her compare,  
> But quite are dimmed, when she is in place.  
> She made me often pipe and now to pipe apace.
>
> Sunne of the world, great glory of the sky,  
> That all the earth doest lighten with thy rayes,  
> Great *Gloriana*, greatest Maiesty,  
> Pardon thy shepheard, mongst so many layes,  
> As he hath sung of thee in all his dayes,  
> To make one minime of thy poore handmayd,  
> And vnderneath thy feete to place her prayse;  
> That when thy glory shall be farre displayd  
> To future age of her this mention may be made.
>
> When thus that shepherd ended had his speach,  
> Sayd *Calidore* ; Now sure it yrketh mee,  
> That to thy blisse I made this luckelesse breach,  
> As now the author of thy bale to be,  
> Thus to bereaue thy Loues deare sight from thee:  
> But gentle Shepheard pardon thou my shame,  
> Who rashly sought that, which I mote not see.  
> Thus did the courteous Knight excuse his blame,  
> And to recomfort him, all comely meanes did frame.
>
> In such discourses they together spent  
> Long time, as fit occasion forth them led;  
> With which the Knight him selfe did much content,  
> And with delight his greedy fancy fed,  
> Both of his words, which he with reason red;  
> And also of the place, whose pleasures rare  
> With such regard his sences rauished,  
> That thence, he had no will away to fare,  
> But wisht, that with that shepheard he mote dwelling share.
>
> But that enuenimd sting, the which of yore,  
> His poysnous point deepe fixed in his hart  
> Had left, now gan afresh to rancle sore,  
> And to renue the rigour of his smart:  
> Which to recure, no skill of Leaches art  
> Mote him auaile, but to returne againe  
> To his wounds worker, that with louely dart  
> Dinting his brest, had bred his restlesse paine,  
> Like as the wounded Whale to shore flies froõ the maine.
>
> So taking leaue of that same gentle swaine,  
> He backe returned to his rusticke wonne,  
> Where his faire *Pastorella* did remaine:  
> To whome in sort, as he at first begonne,  
> He daily did apply him selfe to donne  
> All dewfull seruice voide of thoughts imp\[u\]re:  
> Ne any paines ne perill did he shonne,  
> By which he might her to his loue allure,  
> And liking in her yet vntamed heart procure.
>
> And euermore the shepheard *Coridon*,  
> What euer thing he did her to aggrate,  
> Did striue to match with strong contention,  
> And all his paines did closely emulate;  
> Whether it were to caroll, as they sate  
> Keeping their sheepe, or games to exercize,  
> Or to present her with their labours late;  
> Through which if any grace chaunst to arize  
> To him, the Shepheard streight with iealousie did frize.
>
> One day as they all three together went  
> To the greene wood, to gather strawberies,  
> There chaunst to them a dangerous accident;  
> A Tigre forth out of the wood did rise,  
> That with fell clawes full of fierce gourmandize,  
> And greedy mouth, wide gaping like hell gate,  
> Did runne at *Pastorell*, her to surprize:  
> Whom she beholding, now all desolate  
> Gan cry to them aloud, to helpe ere all too late.
>
> Which *Coridon* first hearing, ran in hast  
> To reskue her, but when he saw the feend,  
> Through cowherd feare he fled away as fast,  
> Ne durst abide the daunger of the end;  
> His life he steemed dearer then his frend.  
> But *Calidore* soone comming to her ayde,  
> When he the beast saw ready now to rend  
> His Loues deare spoile, in which his heart was prayde,  
> He ran at him enrag\[e\]d in stead of being frayde.
>
> He had no weapon, but his shepheards hooke,  
> To serue the vengeaunce of his wrathfull will;  
> With which so sternely he the monster strooke,  
> That to the ground astonished he fell;  
> Whence ere he could recou'r, he did him quell,  
> And hewing off his head, \[he\] it presented  
> Before the feete of the faire *Pastorell*;  
> Who scarcely yet from former feare exempted,  
> A thousand times him thankt, that had her death preuented.
>
> From that day forth she gan him to affect,  
> And daily more her fauour to augment;  
> But *Coridon* for cowherdize reiect,  
> Fit to keepe sheepe, vnfit for loues content:  
> The gentle heart scornes base disparagement.  
> Yet *Calidore* did not despise him quight,  
> But vsde him friendly for further intent,  
> That by his fellowship, he colour might  
> Both his estate, and loue from skill of any wight.
>
> So well he wood her, and so well he wrought her,  
> With humble seruice, and with daily sute,  
> That at the last vnto his will he brought her;  
> Which he so wisely well did prosecute,  
> That of his loue he reapt the timely frute,  
> And ioyed long in close felicity:  
> Till fortune fraught with malice, blinde, and brute,  
> That enuies louers long prosperity,  
> Blew vp a bitter storme of foule aduersity.
>
> It fortuned one day, when *Calidore*  
> Was hunting in the woods (as was his trade)  
> A lawlesse people, *Brigants* hight of yore,  
> That neuer vsde to liue by plough nor spade,  
> But fed on spoile and booty, which they made  
> Vpon their neighbours, which did nigh them border,  
> The dwelling of these shepheards did inuade,  
> And spoyld their houses, and them selues did murder;  
> And droue away their flocks, with other much disorder.
>
> Amongst the rest, the which they then did pray,  
> They spoyld old *Melibee* of all he had,  
> And all his people captiue led away;  
> Mongst which this lucklesse mayd away was lad,  
> Faire *Pastorella*, sorrowfull and sad,  
> Most sorrowfull, most sad, that euer sigh't,  
> Now made the spoile of theeues and *Brigants* bad,  
> Which was the conquest of the gentlest Knight,  
> That euer liu'd, and th'onely glory of his might.
>
> With them also was taken *Coridon*,  
> And carried captiue by those theeues away;  
> Who in the couert of the night, that none  
> Mote them descry, nor reskue from their pray,  
> Vnto their dwelling did them close conuay.  
> Their dwelling in a little Island was,  
> Couered with shrubby woods, in which no way  
> Appeard for people in nor out to pas,  
> Nor any footing fynde for ouergrowen gras.
>
> For vnderneath the ground their way was made,  
> Through hollow caues, that no man mote discouer  
> For the thicke shrubs, which did them alwaies shade  
> From view of liuing wight, and couered ouer:  
> But darkenesse dred and daily night did houer  
> Through all the inner parts, wherein they dwelt,  
> Ne lightned was with window, nor with louer,  
> But with continuall candlelight, which delt  
> A doubtfull sense of things, not so well seene, as felt.
>
> Hither those *Brigants* brought their present pray,  
> And kept them with continuall watch and ward,  
> Meaning so soone, as they conuenient may,  
> For slaues to sell them, for no small reward,  
> To merchants, which them kept in bondage hard,  
> Or sold againe. Now when faire *Pastorell*  
> Into this place was brought, and kept with gard  
> Of griesly theeues, she thought her self in hell,  
> Where with such damned fiends she should in darknesse dwell.
>
> But for to tell the dolefull dreriment,  
> And pittifull complaints, which there she made,  
> Where day and night she nought did but lament  
> Her wretched life, shut vp in deadly shade,  
> And waste her goodly beauty, which did fade  
> Like to a flowre, that feeles no heate of sunne,  
> Which may her feeble leaues with comfort glade.  
> But what befell her in that theeuish wonne,  
> Will in an other Canto better be begonne.
