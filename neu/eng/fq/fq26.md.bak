THE THIRD  
BOOKE OF THE  
FAERIE QVEENE.

*Contayning,*

THE LEGEND OF BRITOMARTIS.

*OR*

*Of Chastitie.*

> I T falles me here to write of Chastity,  
> That fairest vertue, farre aboue the rest;  
> For which what needs me fetch from *Faery*  
> Forreine ensamples, it to haue exprest?  
> Sith it is shrined in my Soueraines brest,  
> And form'd so liuely in each perfect part  
> That to all Ladies, which haue it profest,  
> Need but behold the pourtraict of her hart,  
> If pourtrayd it might be by any liuing art.
>
> But liuing art may not least part expresse,  
> Nor life-resembling pencill it can paint,  
> All were it *Zeuxis* or *Praxiteles:*  
> His daedale hand would faile, and greatly faint,  
> And her perfections with his error taint:  
> Ne Poets wit, that passeth Painter farre  
> In picturing the parts of beautie daint,  
> So hard a workmanship aduenture darre,  
> For fear through want of words her excellence to marre.
>
> How then shall I, Apprentice of the skill,  
> That whylome in diuinest wits did raine,  
> Presume so high to stretch mine humble quill?  
> Yet now my lucklesse lot doth me constraine  
> Hereto perforce. But ô dred Soueraine  
> Thus farre forth pardon, sith that choicest wit  
> Cannot your glorious pourtraict figure plaine  
> That I in colourd showes may shadow it,  
> And antique praises vnto present persons fit.
>
> But if in liuing colours, and right hew,  
> Your selfe you couet to see pictured,  
> Who can it doe more liuely, or more trew,  
> Then that sweet verse, with *Nectar* sprinckeled,  
> In which a gracious seruant pictured  
> His *Cynthia*, his heauens fairest light?  
> That with his melting sweetnesse rauished,  
> And with the wonder of her beames bright,  
> My senses lulled are in slomber of delight.
>
> But let that same delitious Poet lend  
> A little leaue vnto a rusticke Muse  
> To sing his mistresse prayse, and let him mend,  
> If ought amis her liking may abuse:  
> Ne let his fairest *Cynthia* refuse,  
> In mirrours more then one her selfe to see,  
> But either *Gloriana* let her chuse,  
> Or in *Belphoebe* fashioned to bee:  
> In th'one her rule, in th'other her rare chastitee.
