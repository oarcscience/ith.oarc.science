*Cant. III.*

> *Merlin bewrayes to Britomart,  
> the state of Artegall.  
> And shewes the famous Progeny  
> which from them springen shall.*

> M Ost sacred fire, that burnest mightily  
> In liuing brests, ykindled first aboue,  
> Emongst th'eternall spheres and lamping sky,  
> And thence pourd into men, which men call Loue;  
> Not that same, which doth base affections moue  
> In brutish minds, and filthy lust inflame,  
> But that sweet fit, that doth true beautie loue,  
> And choseth vertue for his dearest Dame,  
> Whence spring all noble deeds and neuer dying fame:
>
> Well did Antiquitie a God thee deeme,  
> That ouer mortall minds hast so great might,  
> To order them, as best to thee doth seeme,  
> And all their actions to direct aright;  
> The fatall purpose of diuine foresight,  
> Thou doest effect in destined descents,  
> Through deepe impression of thy secret might,  
> And stirredst vp th'Heroes high intents,  
> Which the late world admyres for wondrous monimẽts.
>
> But thy dread darts in none doe triumph more,  
> Ne brauer proofe in any, of thy powre  
> Shew'dst thou, then in this royall Maid of yore,  
> Making her seeke an vnknowne Paramoure,  
> From the worlds end, through many a bitter stowre:  
> From whose two loynes thou afterwards did rayse  
> Most famous fruits of matrimoniall bowre,  
> Which through the earth haue spred their liuing prayse,  
> That fame in trompe of gold eternally displayes.
>
> Begin then, ô my dearest sacred Dame,  
> Daughter of *Phoebus* and of *Memorie*,  
> That doest ennoble with immortall name  
> The warlike Worthies, from antiquitie,  
> In thy great volume of Eternitie:  
> Begin, ô *Clio*, and recount from hence  
> My glorious Soueraines goodly auncestrie,  
> Till that by dew degrees and long pretence,  
> Thou haue it lastly brought vnto her Excellence.
>
> Full many wayes within her troubled mind,  
> Old *Glauce* cast, to cure this Ladies griefe:  
> Full many waies she sought, but none could find,  
> Nor herbes, nor charmes, nor counsell, that is chiefe  
> And choisest med'cine for sicke harts reliefe:  
> For thy great care she tooke, and greater feare,  
> Least that it should her turne to foule repriefe,  
> And sore reproch, when so her father deare  
> Should of his dearest daughters hard misfortune heare.
>
> At last she her auisd, that he, which made  
> That mirrhour, wherein the sicke Damosell  
> So straungely vewed her straunge louers shade,  
> To weet, the learned *Merlin*, well could tell,  
> Vnder what coast of heauen the man did dwell,  
> And by what meanes his loue might best be wrought:  
> For though beyond the *Africk Ismaell*,  
> Or th'Indian *Peru* he were, she thought  
> Him forth through infinite endeuour to haue sought.
>
> Forthwith themselues disguising both in straunge  
> And base attyre, that none might them bewray,  
> To *Maridunum*, that is now by chaunge  
> Of name *Cayr-Merdin* cald, they tooke their way:  
> There the wise *Merlin* whylome wont (they say)  
> To make his wonne, low vnderneath the ground,  
> In a deepe delue, farre from the vew of day,  
> That of no liuing wight he mote be found,  
> When so he counseld with his sprights encõpast round.
>
> And if thou euer happen that same way  
> To trauell, goe to see that dreadfull place:  
> It is an hideous hollow caue (they say)  
> Vnder a rocke that lyes a little space  
> From the swift *Barry*, tombling downe apace,  
> Emongst the woodie hilles of *Dyneuowre*:  
> But dare thou not, I charge, in any cace,  
> To enter into that same balefull Bowre,  
> For fear the cruell Feends should thee vnwares deuowre.
>
> But standing high aloft, low lay thine eare,  
> And there such ghastly noise of yron chaines,  
> And brasen Caudrons thou shalt rombling heare,  
> Which thousand sprights with long enduring paines  
> Doe tosse, that it will stonne thy feeble braines,  
> And oftentimes great grones, and grieuous stounds,  
> When too huge toile and labour them constraines:  
> And oftentimes loud strokes, and ringing sounds  
> From vnder that deepe Rocke most horribly rebounds.
>
> The cause some say is this: A litle while  
> Before that *Merlin* dyde, he did intend,  
> A brasen wall in compas to compile  
> About *Cairmardin*, and did it commend  
> Vnto these Sprights, to bring to perfect end.  
> During which worke the Ladie of the Lake,  
> Whom long he lou'd, for him in hast did send,  
> Who thereby forst his workemen to forsake,  
> Them bound till his returne, their labour not to slake.
>
> In the meane time through that false Ladies traine,  
> He was surprisd, and buried vnder beare,  
> Ne euer to his worke returnd againe:  
> Nath'lesse those feends may not their worke forbeare,  
> So greatly his commaundement they feare,  
> But there doe toyle and trauell day and night,  
> Vntill that brasen wall they vp doe reare:  
> For *Merlin* had in Magicke more insight,  
> Then euer him before or after liuing wight.
>
> For he by words could call out of the sky  
> Both Sunne and Moone, and make them him obay:  
> The land to sea, and sea to maineland dry,  
> And darkesome night he eke could turne to day:  
> Huge hostes of men he could alone dismay,  
> And hostes of men of meanest things could frame,  
> When so him list his enimies to fray:  
> That to this day for terror of his fame,  
> The feends do quake, when any him to them does name.
>
> And sooth, men say that he was not the sonne  
> Of mortall Syre, or other liuing wight,  
> But wondrously begotten, and begonne  
> By false illusion of a guilefull Spright,  
> On a faire Ladie Nonne, that whilome hight  
> *Matilda*, daughter to *Pubidius*,  
> Who was the Lord of *Mathrauall* by right,  
> And coosen vnto king *Ambrosius*:  
> Whence he indued was with skill so maruellous.
>
> They here ariuing, staid a while without,  
> Ne durst aduenture rashly in to wend,  
> But of their first intent gan make new dout  
> For dread of daunger, which it might portend:  
> Vntill the hardie Mayd (with loue to frend)  
> First entering, the dreadfull Mage there found  
> Deepe busied bout worke of wondrous end,  
> And writing strange characters in the ground,  
> With which the stubborn feends he to his seruice bound.
>
> He nought was moued at their entrance bold:  
> For of their comming well he wist afore,  
> Yet list them bid their businesse to vnfold,  
> As if ought in this world in secret store  
> Were from him hidden, or vnknowne of yore.  
> Then *Glauce* thus, Let not it thee offend,  
> That we thus rashly through thy darkesome dore,  
> Vnwares haue prest: for either fatall end,  
> Or other mightie cause vs two did hither send.
>
> He bad tell on; and then she thus began.  
> Now haue three Moones with borrow'd brothers light,  
> Thrice shined faire, and thrice seem'd dim and wan,  
> Sith a sore euill, which this virgin bright  
> Tormenteth, and doth plonge in dolefull plight,  
> First rooting tooke; but what thing it mote bee,  
> Or whence it sprong, I cannot read aright:  
> But this I read, that but if remedee  
> Thou her afford, full shortly I her dead shall see.
>
> Therewith th'Enchaunter softly gan to smyle  
> At her smooth speeches, weeting inly well,  
> That she to him dissembled womanish guyle,  
> And to her said, Beldame, by that ye tell,  
> More need of leach-craft hath your Damozell,  
> Then of my skill: who helpe may haue elsewhere,  
> In vaine seekes wonders out of Magicke spell.  
> Th'old woman wox half blanck, those words to heare;  
> And yet was loth to let her purpose plaine appeare.
>
> And to him said, If any leaches skill,  
> Or other learned meanes could haue redrest  
> This my deare daughters deepe engraffed ill,  
> Certes I should be loth thee to molest:  
> But this sad euill, which doth her infest,  
> Doth course of naturall cause farre exceed,  
> And housed is within her hollow brest,  
> That either seemes some cursed witches deed,  
> Or euill spright, that in her doth such torment breed.
>
> The wisard could no lenger beare her bord,  
> But brusting forth in laughter, to her sayd;  
> *Glauce*, what needs this colourable word,  
> To cloke the cause, that hath it selfe bewrayd?  
> Ne ye faire *Britomartis*, thus arayd,  
> More hidden are, then Sunne in cloudy vele;  
> Whom thy good fortune, hauing fate obayd,  
> Hath hither brought, for succour to appele;  
> The which the powres to thee are pleased to reuele.
>
> The doubtfull Mayd, seeing her selfe descryde,  
> Was all abasht, and her pure yuory  
> Into a cleare Carnation suddeine dyde;  
> As faire *Aurora* rising hastily,  
> Doth by her blushing tell, that she did lye  
> All night in old *Tithonus* frosen bed,  
> Whereof she seemes ashamed inwardly.  
> But her old Nourse was nought dishartened,  
> But vauntage made of that, which *Merlin* had ared.
>
> And sayd, Sith then thou knowest all our griefe,  
> (For what doest not thou know?) of grace I pray,  
> Pitty our plaint, and yield vs meet reliefe.  
> With that the Prophet still awhile did stay,  
> And then his spirite thus gan forth display;  
> Most noble Virgin, that by fatall lore  
> Hast learn'd to loue, let no whit thee dismay  
> The hard begin, that meets thee in the dore,  
> And with sharpe fits thy tender hart oppresseth sore.
>
> For so must all things excellent begin,  
> And eke enrooted deepe must be that Tree,  
> Whose big embodied braunches shall not lin,  
> Till they to heauens hight forth stretched bee.  
> For from thy wombe a famous Progenie  
> Shall spring, out of the auncient *Troian* blood,  
> Which shall reuiue the sleeping memorie  
> Of those same antique Peres, the heauens brood,  
> Which *Greece* and *Asian* riuers stained with their blood.
>
> Renowmed kings, and sacred Emperours,  
> Thy fruitfull Ofspring, shall from thee descend;  
> Braue Captaines, and most mighty warriours,  
> That shall their conquests through all lands extend,  
> And their decayed kingdomes shall amend:  
> The feeble Britons, broken with long warre,  
> They shall vpreare, and mightily defend  
> Against their forrein foe, that comes from farre,  
> Till vniuersall peace compound all ciuill iarre.
>
> It was not, *Britomart*, thy wandring eye,  
> Glauncing vnwares in charmed looking glas,  
> But the streight course of heauenly destiny,  
> Led with eternall prouidence, that has  
> Guided thy glaunce, to bring his will to pas:  
> Ne is thy fate, ne is thy fortune ill,  
> To loue the prowest knight, that euer was.  
> Therefore submit thy wayes vnto his will,  
> And do by all dew meanes thy destiny fulfill.
>
> But read (said *Glauce*) thou Magitian  
> What meanes shall she out seeke, or what wayes take?  
> How shall she know, how shall she find the man?  
> Or what needs her to toyle, sith fates can make  
> Way for themselues, their purpose to partake?  
> Then *Merlin* thus; Indeed the fates are firme,  
> And may not shrinck, though all the world do shake:  
> Yet ought mens good endeuours them confirme,  
> And guide the heauenly causes to their constant terme.
>
> The man whom heauens haue ordaynd to bee  
> The spouse of *Britomart*, is *Arthegall*:  
> He wonneth in the land of *Fayeree*,  
> Yet is no *Fary* borne, ne sib at all  
> To Elfes, but sprong of seed terrestriall,  
> And whilome by false *Faries* stolne away,  
> Whiles yet in infant cradle he did crall;  
> Ne other to himselfe is knowne this day,  
> But that he by an Elfe was gotten of a *Fay*.
>
> But sooth he is the sonne of *Gorlois*,  
> And brother vnto *Cador* Cornish king,  
> And for his warlike feates renowmed is,  
> From where the day out of the sea doth spring,  
> Vntill the closure of the Euening.  
> From thence, him firmely bound with faithfull band,  
> To this his natiue soyle thou backe shalt bring,  
> Strongly to aide his countrey, to withstand  
> The powre of forrein Paynims, which inuade thy land.
>
> Great aid thereto his mighty puissaunce,  
> And dreaded name shall giue in that sad day:  
> Where also proofe of thy prow valiaunce  
> Thou then shalt make, t'increase thy louers pray.  
> Long time ye both in armes shall beare great sway,  
> Till thy wombes burden thee from them do call,  
> And his last fate him from thee take away,  
> Too rathe cut off by practise criminall  
> Of secret foes, that him shall make in mischiefe fall.
>
> Where thee yet shall he leaue for memory  
> Of his late puissaunce, his Image dead,  
> That liuing him in all actiuity  
> To thee shall represent. He from the head  
> Of his coosin *Constantius* without dread  
> Shall take the crowne, that was his fathers right,  
> And therewith crowne himselfe in th'others stead:  
> Then shall he issew forth with dreadfull might,  
> Against his Saxon foes in bloudy field to fight.
>
> Like as a Lyon, that in drowsie caue  
> Hath long time slept, himselfe so shall he shake,  
> And comming forth, shall spred his banner braue  
> Ouer the troubled South, that it shall make  
> The warlike *Mertians* for feare to quake:  
> Thrise shall he fight with them, and twise shall win,  
> But the third time shall faire accordaunce make:  
> And if he then with victorie can lin,  
> He shall his dayes with peace bring to his earthly In.
>
> His sonne, hight *Vortipore*, shall him succeede  
> In kingdome, but not in felicity;  
> Yet shall he long time warre with happy speed,  
> And with great honour many battels try:  
> But at the last to th'importunity  
> Of froward fortune shall be forst to yield.  
> But his sonne *Malgo* shall full mightily  
> Auenge his fathers losse, with speare and shield,  
> And his proud foes discomfit in victorious field.
>
> Behold the man, and tell me *Britomart*,  
> If ay more goodly creature thou didst see;  
> How like a Gyaunt in each manly part  
> Beares he himselfe with portly maiestee,  
> That one of th'old *Heroes* seemes to bee:  
> He the six Islands, comprouinciall  
> In auncient times vnto great Britainee,  
> Shall to the same reduce, and to him call  
> Their sundry kings to do their homage seuerall.
>
> All which his sonne *Careticus* awhile  
> Shall well defend, and *Saxons* powre suppresse,  
> Vntill a straunger king from vnknowne soyle  
> Arriuing, him with multitude oppresse;  
> Great *Gormond*, hauing with huge mightinesse  
> Ireland subdewd, and therein fixt his throne,  
> Like a swift Otter, fell through emptinesse,  
> Shall ouerswim the sea with many one  
> Of his Norueyses, to assist the Britons fone.
>
> He in his furie all shall ouerrunne,  
> And holy Church with faithlesse hands deface,  
> That thy sad people vtterly fordonne,  
> Shall to the vtmost mountaines fly apace:  
> Was neuer so great wast in any place,

>
> Whiles thus thy Britons do in languour pine,  
> Proud *Etheldred* shall from the North arise,  
> Seruing th'ambitious will of *Augustine*,  
> And passing *Dee* with hardy enterprise,  
> Shall backe repulse the valiaunt *Brockwell* twise,  
> And *Bangor* with massacred Martyrs fill;  
> But the third time shall rew his foolhardise:

> Shall stoutly him defeat, and thousand *Saxons* kill.
>
> But after him, *Cadwallin* mightily  
> On his sonne *Edwin* all those wrongs shall wreake;  
> Ne shall auaile the wicked sorcery  
> Of false *Pellite*, his purposes to breake,  
> But him shall slay, and on a gallowes bleake  
> Shall giue th'enchaunter his vnhappy hire;  
> Then shall the Britons, late dismayd and weake,  
> From their long vassalage gin to respire,  
> And on their Paynim foes auenge their ranckled ire.
>
> Ne shall he yet his wrath so mitigate,

> Shall yield him selfe his liegeman, and sweare fealty.
>
> Him shall he make his fatall Instrument,  
> T'afflict the other *Saxons* vnsubdewd;  
> He marching forth with fury insolent  
> Against the good king *Oswald*, who indewd  
> With heauenly powre, and by Angels reskewd,

>
> Where at *Cadwallin* wroth, shall forth issew,  
> And an huge hoste into Northumber lead,  
> With which he godly *Oswald* shall subdew,  
> And crowne with martyrdome his sacred head.  
> Whose brother *Oswin*, daunted with like dread,  
> With price of siluer shall his kingdome buy,  
> And *Penda*, seeking him adowne to tread,  
> Shall tread adowne, and do him fowly dye,  
> But shall with gifts his Lord *Cadwallin* pacify.
>
> Then shall *Cadwallin* dye, and then the raine  
> Of *Britons* eke with him attonce shall dye;  
> Ne shall the good *Cadwallader* with paine,

> Yet after all these sorrowes, and huge hills

> Then woe, and woe, and euerlasting woe,

>
> The Damzell was full deepe empassioned,

> For *Rhodoricke*, whose surname shalbe Great,

> Of natiue courage, that his foes shall feare,  
> Least backe againe the kingdome he from them should beare.
>
> Ne shall the Saxons selues all peaceably

> Yet shall a third both these, and thine subdew;

>
> Tho when the terme is full accomplishid,

> So shall the Briton bloud their crowne againe reclame.
>
> Thenceforth eternall vnion shall be made

> Exploits made *Rome* to quake, stout *Guendolen*,  
> Renowmed *Martia*, and redoubted *Emmilen*.
>
> And that, which more then all the rest may sway,  
> Late dayes ensample, which these eyes beheld,  
> In the last field before *Meneuia*  
> Which *Vther* with those forrein Pagans held,  
> I saw a *Saxon* Virgin, the which feld  
> Great *Vlfin* thrise vpon the bloudy plaine,  
> And had not *Carados* her hand withheld  
> From rash reuenge, she had him surely slaine,  
> Yet *Carados* himselfe from her escapt with paine.
>
> Ah read, (quoth *Britomart*) how is she hight?  
> Faire *Angela* (quoth she) men do her call,  
> No whit lesse faire, then terrible in fight:  
> She hath the leading of a Martiall  
> And mighty people, dreaded more then all  
> The other *Saxons*, which do for her sake  
> And loue, themselues of her name *Angles* call.  
> Therefore faire Infant her ensample make  
> Vnto thy selfe, and equall courage to thee take.
>
> Her harty words so deepe into the mynd  
> Of the young Damzell sunke, that great desire  
> Of warlike armes in her forthwith they tynd,  
> And generous stout courage did inspire,  
> That she resolu'd, vnweeting to her Sire,  
> Aduent'rous knighthood on her selfe to don,  
> And counseld with her Nourse, her Maides attire  
> To turne into a massy habergeon,  
> And bad her all things put in readinesse anon.
>
> Th'old woman nought, that needed, did omit;  
> But all things did conueniently puruay:  
> It fortuned (so time their turne did fit)  
> A band of Britons ryding on forray  
> Few dayes before, had gotten a great pray  
> Of Saxon goods, emongst the which was seene  
> A goodly Armour, and full rich aray,  
> Which long'd to *Angela*, the Saxon Queene,  
> All fretted round with gold, and goodly well beseene.
>
> The same, with all the other ornaments,  
> King *Ryence* caused to be hanged hy  
> In his chiefe Church, for endlesse moniments  
> Of his successe and gladfull victory:  
> Of which her selfe auising readily,  
> In th'euening late old *Glauce* thither led  
> Faire *Britomart*, and that same Armory  
> Downe taking, her therein appareled,  
> Well as she might, and with braue bauldrick garnished.
>
> Beside those armes there stood a mighty speare,  
> Which *Bladud* made by Magick art of yore,  
> And vsd the same in battell aye to beare;  
> Sith which it had bin here preseru'd in store,  
> For his great vertues proued long afore:  
> For neuer wight so fast in sell could sit,  
> But him perforce vnto the ground it bore:  
> Both speare she tooke, and shield, which hong by it:  
> Both speare & shield of great powre, for her purpose fit.
>
> Thus when she had the virgin all arayd,  
> Another harnesse, which did hang thereby,  
> About her selfe she dight, that the young Mayd  
> She might in equall armes accompany,  
> And as her Squire attend her carefully:  
> Tho to their ready Steeds they clombe full light,  
> And through back wayes, that none might them espy,  
> Couered with secret cloud of silent night,  
> Themselues they forth conuayd, & passed forward right.
>
> Ne rested they, till that to Faery lond  
> They came, as *Merlin* them directed late:  
> Where meeting with this *Redcrosse* knight, she fond  
> Of diuerse things discourses to dilate,  
> But most of *Arthegall*, and his estate.  
> At last their wayes so fell, that they mote part  
> Then each to other well affectionate,  
> Friendship professed with vnfained hart,  
> The *Redcrosse* knight diuerst, but forth rode *Britomart*.
