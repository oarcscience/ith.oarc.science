*Cant. X.*

> *Prince Arthur takes the enterprize  
> for Belgee for to fight:  
> Gerioneos Seneschall  
> he slayes in Belges right.*

> S Ome Clarkes doe doubt in their deuicefull art,  
> Whether this heauenly thing, whereof I treat,  
> To weeten *Mercie*, be of Iustice part,  
> Or drawne forth from her by diuine extreate.  
> This well I wote, that sure she is as great,  
> And meriteth to haue as high a place,  
> Sith in th'Almighties euerlasting seat  
> She first was bred, and borne of heauenly race;  
> From thence pour'd down on men, by influence of grace.
>
> For if that Vertue be of so great might,  
> Which from iust verdict will for nothing start,  
> But to preserue inuiolated right,  
> Oft spilles the principall, to saue the part;  
> So much more then is that of powre and art,  
> That seekes to saue the subiect of her skill,  
> Yet neuer doth from doome of right depart:  
> As it is greater prayse to saue, then spill,  
> And better to reforme, then to cut off the ill.
>
> Who then can thee, *Mercilla*, throughly prayse,  
> That herein doest all earthly Princes pas?  
> What heauenly Muse shall thy great honour rayse  
> Vp to the skies, whence first deriu'd it was,  
> And now on earth it selfe enlarged has,  
> From th'vtmost brinke of the *Armericke* shore,  
> Vnto the margent of the *Molucas*?  
> Those Nations farre thy iustice doe adore:  
> But thine owne people do thy mercy prayse much more.
>
> Much more it praysed was of those two knights;  
> The noble Prince, and righteous *Artegall*,  
> When they had seene and heard her doome a rights  
> Against *Duessa*, damned by them all;  
> But by her tempred without griefe or gall,  
> Till strong constraint did her thereto enforce.  
> And yet euen then ruing her wilfull fall,  
> With more then needfull naturall remorse,  
> And yeelding the last honour to her wretched corse.
>
> During all which, those knights continu'd there,  
> Both doing and receiuing curtesies,  
> Of that great Ladie, who with goodly chere  
> Them entertayn'd, fit for their dignities,  
> Approuing dayly to their noble eyes  
> Royall examples of her mercies rare,  
> And worthie paterns of her clemencies;  
> Which till this day mongst many liuing are,  
> Who them to their posterities doe still declare.
>
> Amongst the rest, which in that space befell,  
> There came two Springals of full tender yeares,  
> Farre thence from forrein land, where they did dwell,  
> To seeke for succour of her and of her Peares  
> With humble prayers and intreatfull teares;  
> Sent by their mother, who a widow was,  
> Wrapt in great dolours and in deadly feares,  
> By a strong Tyrant, who inuaded has  
> Her land, and slaine her children ruefully alas.
>
> Her name was *Belgæ*, who in former age  
> A Ladie of great worth and wealth had beene,  
> And mother of a frutefull heritage,  
> Euen seuenteene goodly sonnes; which who had seene  
> In their first flowre, before this fatall teene  
> Them ouertooke, and their faire blossomes blasted,  
> More happie mother would her surely weene,  
> Then famous *Niobe*, before she tasted  
> *Latonaes* childrens wrath, that all her issue wasted.
>
> But this fell Tyrant, through his tortious powre,  
> Had left her now but fiue of all that brood:  
> For twelue of them he did by times deuoure,  
> And to his Idols sacrifice their blood,  
> Whylest he of none was stopped, nor withstood.  
> For soothly he was one of matchlesse might,  
> Of horrible aspect, and dreadfull mood,  
> And had three bodies in one wast empight,  
> And th'armes and legs of three, to succour him in fight.
>
> And sooth they say, that he was borne and bred  
> Of Gyants race, the sonne of *Geryon*,  
> He that whylome in Spaine so sore was dred,  
> For his huge powre and great oppression,  
> Which brought that land to his subiection,  
> Through his three bodies powre, in one combynd;  
> And eke all strangers in that region  
> Arryuing, to his kyne for food assynd;  
> The fayrest kyne aliue, but of the fiercest kynd.
>
> For they were all, they say, of purple hew,  
> Kept by a cowheard, hight *Eurytion*,  
> A cruell carle, the which all strangers slew,  
> Ne day nor night did sleepe, t'attend them on,  
> But walkt about them euer and anone,  
> With his two headed dogge, that *Orthrus* hight;  
> *Orthrus* begotten by great *Typhaon*,  
> And foule *Echidna*, in the house of night;  
> But *Hercules* them all did ouercome in fight.
>
> His sonne was this, *Geryoneo* hight,  
> Who after that his monstrous father fell  
> Vnder *Alcides* club, streight tooke his flight  
> From that sad land, where he his syre did quell,  
> And came to this, where *Belge* then did dwell,  
> And flourish in all wealth and happinesse,  
> Being then new made widow (as befell)  
> After her Noble husbands late decesse;  
> Which gaue beginning to her woe and wretchednesse.
>
> Then this bold Tyrant, of her widowhed  
> Taking aduantage, and her yet fresh woes,  
> Himselfe and seruice to her offered,  
> Her to defend against all forrein foes,  
> That should their powre against her right oppose.  
> Whereof she glad, now needing strong defence,  
> Him entertayn'd, and did her champion chose:  
> Which long he vsd with carefull diligence,  
> The better to confirme her fearelesse confidence.
>
> By meanes whereof, she did at last commit  
> All to his hands, and gaue him soueraine powre  
> To doe, what euer he thought good or fit.  
> Which hauing got, he gan forth from that howre  
> To stirre vp strife, and many a Tragicke stowre,  
> Giuing her dearest children one by one  
> Vnto a dreadfull Monster to deuoure,  
> And setting vp an Idole of his owne,  
> The image of his monstrous parent *Geryone*.
>
> So tyrannizing, and oppressing all,  
> The woefull widow had no meanes now left,  
> But vnto gratious great *Mercilla* call  
> For ayde, against that cruell Tyrants theft,  
> Ere all her children he from her had reft.  
> Therefore these two, her eldest sonnes she sent,  
> To seeke for succour of this Ladies gieft:  
> To whom their sute they humbly did present,  
> In th'hearing of full many Knights and Ladies gent.
>
> Amongst the which then fortuned to bee  
> The noble Briton Prince, with his braue Peare;  
> Who when he none of all those knights did see  
> Hastily bent, that enterprise to heare,  
> Nor vndertake the same, for cowheard feare,  
> He stepped forth with courage bold and great,  
> Admyr'd of all the rest in presence there,  
> And humbly gan that mightie Queene entreat,  
> To graunt him that aduenture for his former feat.
>
> She gladly graunted it: then he straight way  
> Himselfe vnto his iourney gan prepare,  
> And all his armours readie dight that day,  
> That nought the morrow next mote stay his fare.  
> The morrow next appear'd, with purple hayre  
> Yet dropping fresh out of the *Indian* fount,  
> And bringing light into the heauens fayre,  
> When he was readie to his steede to mount  
> Vnto his way, which now was all his care and count.
>
> Then taking humble leaue of that great Queene,  
> Who gaue him roiall giftes and riches rare,  
> As tokens of her thankefull mind beseene,  
> And leauing *Artegall* to his owne care;  
> Vpon his voyage forth he gan to fare,  
> With those two gentle youthes, which him did guide,  
> And all his way before him still prepare.  
> Ne after him did *Artegall* abide,  
> But on his first aduenture forward forth did ride.
>
> It was not long, till that the Prince arriued  
> Within the land, where dwelt that Ladie sad,  
> Whereof that Tyrant had her now depriued,  
> And into moores and marshes banisht had,  
> Out of the pleasant soyle, and citties glad,  
> In which she wont to harbour happily:  
> But now his cruelty so sore she drad,  
> That to those fennes for fastnesse she did fly,  
> And there her selfe did hyde from his hard tyranny.
>
> There he her found in sorrow and dismay,  
> All solitarie without liuing wight;  
> For all her other children, through affray,  
> Had hid themselues, or taken further flight:  
> And eke her selfe through sudden strange affright,  
> When one in armes she saw, began to fly;  
> But when her owne two sonnes she had in sight,  
> She gan take hart, and looke vp ioyfully:  
> For well she wist this knight came, succour to supply.
>
> And running vnto them with greedy ioyes,  
> Fell straight about their neckes, as they did kneele,  
> And bursting forth in teares; Ah my sweet boyes,  
> (Sayd she) yet now I gin new life to feele,  
> And feeble spirits, that gan faint and reele,  
> Now rise againe, at this your ioyous sight.  
> Alreadie seemes that fortunes headlong wheele  
> Begins to turne, and sunne to shine more bright,  
> Then it was wont, through comfort of this noble knight.
>
> Then turning vnto him; And you Sir knight  
> (Said she) that taken haue this toylesome paine  
> For wretched woman, miserable wight,  
> May you in heauen immortall guerdon gaine  
> For so great trauell, as you doe sustaine:  
> For other meede may hope for none of mee,  
> To whom nought else, but bare life doth remaine,  
> And that so wretched one, as ye do see  
> Is liker lingring death, then loathed life to bee.
>
> Much was he moued with her piteous plight,  
> And low dismounting from his loftie steede,  
> Gan to recomfort her all that he might,  
> Seeking to driue away deepe rooted dreede,  
> With hope of helpe in that her greatest neede.  
> So thence he wished her with him to wend,  
> Vnto some place, where they mote rest and feede,  
> And she take comfort, which God now did send:  
> Good hart in euils doth the euils much amend.
>
> Ay me (sayd she) and whether shall I goe?  
> Are not all places full of forraine powres?  
> My pallaces possessed of my foe,  
> My cities sackt, and their sky-threating towres  
> Raced, and made smooth fields now full of flowres?  
> Onely these marishes, and myrie bogs,  
> In which the fearefull ewftes do build their bowres,  
> Yeeld me an hostry mongst the croking frogs,  
> And harbour here in safety from those rauenous dogs.
>
> Nathlesse (said he) deare Ladie with me goe,  
> Some place shall vs receiue, and harbour yield;  
> If not, we will it force, maugre your foe,  
> And purchase it to vs with speare and shield:  
> And if all fayle, yet farewell open field:  
> The earth to all her creatures lodging lends.  
> With such his chearefull speaches he doth wield  
> Her mind so well, that to his will she bends  
> And bynding vp her locks and weeds, forth with him wends.
>
> They came vnto a Citie farre vp land,  
> The which whylome that Ladies owne had bene;  
> But now by force extort out of her hand,  
> By her strong foe, who had defaced cleene  
> Her stately towres, and buildings sunny sheene;  
> Shut vp her hauen, mard her marchants trade,  
> Robbed her people, that full rich had beene,  
> And in her necke a Castle huge had made,  
> The which did her cõmaund, without needing perswade.
>
> That Castle was the strength of all that state,  
> Vntill that state by strength was pulled downe,  
> And that same citie, so now ruinate,  
> Had bene the keye of all that kingdomes crowne;  
> Both goodly Castle, and both goodly Towne,  
> Till that th'offended heauens list to lowre  
> Vpon their blisse, and balefull fortune frowne.  
> When those gainst states and kingdomes do coniure,  
> Who then can thinke their hedlong ruine to recure.
>
> But he had brought it now in seruile bond,  
> And made it beare the yoke of inquisition,  
> Stryuing long time in vaine it to withstond;  
> Yet glad at last to make most base submission,  
> And life enioy for any composition.  
> So now he hath new lawes and orders new  
> Imposd on it, with many a hard condition,  
> And forced it, the honour that is dew  
> To God, to doe vnto his Idole most vntrew.
>
> To him he hath, before this Castle greene,  
> Built a faire Chappell, and an Altar framed  
> Of costly Iuory, full rich beseene,  
> On which that cursed Idole farre proclamed,  
> He hath set vp, and him his God hath named;  
> Offring to him in sinfull sacrifice  
> The flesh of men, to Gods owne likenesse framed,  
> And powring forth their bloud in brutishe wize,  
> That any yron eyes to see it would agrize.
>
> And for more horror and more crueltie,  
> Vnder that cursed Idols altar stone;  
> An hideous monster doth in darknesse lie,  
> Whose dreadfull shape was neuer seene of none  
> That liues on earth; but vnto those alone  
> The which vnto him sacrificed bee.  
> Those he deuoures, they say, both flesh and bone:  
> What else they haue, is all the Tyrants fee;  
> So that no whit of them remayning one may see.
>
> There eke he placed a strong garrisone,  
> And set a Seneschall of dreaded might,  
> That by his powre oppressed euery one,  
> And vanquished all ventrous knights in fight;  
> To whom he wont shew all the shame he might,  
> After that them in battell he had wonne.  
> To which when now they gan approch in sight,  
> The Ladie counseld him the place to shonne,  
> Whereas so many knights had fouly bene fordonne.
>
> Her fearefull speaches nought he did regard,  
> But ryding streight vnder the Castle wall,  
> Called aloud vnto the watchfull ward,  
> Which there did wayte, willing them forth to call  
> Into the field their Tyrants Seneschall.  
> To whom when tydings thereof came, he streight  
> Cals for his armes, and arming him withall,  
> Eftsoones forth pricked proudly in his might,  
> And gan with courage fierce addresse him to the fight.
>
> They both encounter in the middle plaine,  
> And their sharpe speares doe both together smite  
> Amid their shields, with so huge might and maine,  
> That seem'd their soules they wold haue ryuen quight  
> Out of their breasts, with furious despight.  
> Yet could the Seneschals no entrance find  
> Into the Princes shield, where it empight;  
> So pure the mettall was, and well refynd,  
> But shiuered all about, and scattered in the wynd.
>
> Not so the Princes, but with restlesse force,  
> Into his shield it readie passage found,  
> Both through his haberieon, and eke his corse:  
> Which tombling downe vpon the senselesse ground,  
> Gaue leaue vnto his ghost from thraldome bound,  
> To wander in the griesly shades of night.  
> There did the Prince him leaue in deadly swound,  
> And thence vnto the castle marched right,  
> To see if entrance there as yet obtaine he might.
>
> But as he nigher drew, three knights he spyde,  
> All arm'd to point, issuing forth a pace,  
> Which towards him with all their powre did ryde,  
> And meeting him right in the middle race,  
> Did all their speares attonce on him enchace.  
> As three great Culuerings for battrie bent,  
> And leueld all against one certaine place,  
> Doe all attonce their thunders rage forth rent,  
> That makes the wals to stagger with astonishment:
>
> So all attonce they on the Prince did thonder;  
> Who from his saddle swarued nought asyde,  
> Ne to their force gaue way, that was great wonder,  
> But like a bulwarke, firmely did abyde;  
> Rebutting him, which in the midst did ryde,  
> With so huge rigour, that his mortall speare  
> Past through his shield, & pierst through either syde,  
> That downe he fell vppon his mother deare,  
> And powred forth his wretched life in deadly dreare.
>
> Whom when his other fellowes saw, they fled  
> As fast as feete could carry them away;  
> And after them the Prince as swiftly sped,  
> To be aueng'd of their vnknightly play.  
> There whilest they entring, th'one did th'other stay,  
> The hindmost in the gate he ouerhent,  
> And as he pressed in, him there did slay:  
> His carkasse tumbling on the threshold, sent  
> His groning soule vnto her place of punishment.
>
> The other which was entred, laboured fast  
> To sperre the gate; but that same lumpe of clay,  
> Whose grudging ghost was thereout fled and past,  
> Right in the middest of the threshold lay,  
> That it the Posterne did from closing stay:  
> The whiles the Prince hard preased in betweene,  
> And entraunce wonne. Streight th'other fled away,  
> And ran into the Hall, where he did weene  
> Him selfe to saue: but he there slew him at the skreene.
>
> Then all the rest which in that Castle were,  
> Seeing that sad ensample them before,  
> Durst not abide, but fled away for feare,  
> And them conuayd out at a Posterne dore.  
> Long sought the Prince, but when he found no more  
> T'oppose against his powre, he forth issued  
> Vnto that Lady, where he her had lore,  
> And her gan cheare, with what she there had vewed,  
> And what she had not seene, within vnto her shewed.
>
> Who with right humble thankes him goodly greeting,  
> For so great prowesse, as he there had proued,  
> Much greater then was euer in her weeting,  
> With great admiraunce inwardly was moued,  
> And honourd him, with all that her behoued.  
> Thenceforth into that Castle he her led,  
> With her two sonnes, right deare of her beloued,  
> Where all that night them selues they cherished,  
> And from her balefull minde all care he banished.
