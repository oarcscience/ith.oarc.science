THE SIXTH  
BOOKE OF THE  
FAERIE QVEENE.

*Contayning*  
THE LEGEND OF S. CALIDORE  
  
*OR*  
OF COVRTESIE.

> T He waies, through which my weary steps I guyde,  
> In this delightfull land of Faery,  
> Are so exceeding spacious and wyde,  
> And sprinckled with such sweet variety,  
> Of all that pleasant is to eare or eye,  
> That I nigh rauisht with rare thoughts delight,  
> My tedious trauell doe forget thereby;  
> And when I gin to feele decay of might,  
> It strength to me supplies, & chears my dulled spright.
>
> Such secret comfort, and such heauenly pleasures,  
> Ye sacred imps, that on *Parnasso* dwell,  
> And there the keeping haue of learnings threasures,  
> Which doe all worldly riches farre excell,  
> Into the mindes of mortall men doe well,  
> And goodly fury into them infuse;  
> Guyde ye my footing, and conduct me well  
> In these strange waies, where neuer foote did vse,  
> Ne none can find, but who was taught them by the Muse.
>
> Reuele to me the sacred noursery  
> Of vertue, which with you doth there remaine,  
> Where it in siluer bowre does hidden ly  
> From view of men, and wicked worlds disdaine.  
> Since it at first was by the Gods with paine  
> Planted in earth, being deriu'd at furst  
> From heauenly seedes of bounty soueraine,  
> And by them long with carefull labour nurst,  
> Till it to ripenesse grew, and forth to honour burst.
>
> Amongst them all growes not a fayrer flowre,  
> Then is the bloosme of comely courtesie,  
> Which though it on a lowly stalke doe bowre,  
> Yet brancheth forth in braue nobilitie,  
> And spreds it selfe through all ciuilitie:  
> Of which though present age doe plenteous seeme,  
> Yet being matcht with plaine Antiquitie,  
> Ye will them all but fayned showes esteeme,  
> Which carry colours faire, that feeble eies misdeeme.
>
> But in the triall of true curtesie,  
> Its now so farre from that, which then it was,  
> That it indeed is nought but forgerie,  
> Fashion'd to please the eies of them, that pas,  
> Which see not perfet things but in a glas:  
> Yet is that glasse so gay, that it can blynd  
> The wisest sight, to thinke gold that is bras.  
> But vertues seat is deepe within the mynd,  
> And not in outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd.
>
> But where shall I in all Antiquity  
> So faire a patterne finde, where may be seene  
> The goodly praise of Princely curtesie,  
> As in your selfe, O soueraine Lady Queene,  
> In whose pure minde, as in a mirrour sheene  
> It showes, and with her brightnesse doth inflame  
> The eyes of all, which thereon fixed beene;  
> But meriteth indeede an higher name:  
> Yet so from low to high vplifted is your fame.
>
> Then pardon me, most dreaded Soueraine,  
> That from your selfe I doe this vertue bring,  
> And to your selfe doe it returne againe:  
> So from the Ocean all riuers spring,  
> And tribute backe repay as to their King.  
> Right so from you all goodly vertues well  
> Into the rest, which round about you ring,  
> Faire Lords and Ladies, which about you dwell,  
> And doe adorne your Court, where courtesies excell.
