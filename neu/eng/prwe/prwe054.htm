<P ALIGN="CENTER">JAHN TERGAGLE THE STEWARD.</p>
<P><br>
THERE are numerous versions of this legend, and sundry statements I made as to
the man who is supposed to have achieved the no very envious immortality which
he enjoys.</p>
<P>One or two of these may interest the reader.</p>
<P>The following very characteristic narrative, from a
much-esteemed correspondent, gives several incidents which have not a place in
the legend as I have related it, which comprehends the explanation given for
the appearance of Tregeagle at so many different parts of the county.</p>
<P>The Tregeagle, of whom mention occurs in the writings of
Cornish legendary authors, was a real person: a member of a respectable
family, resident during the seventeenth century at Trevorder, in the parish of
St Breock, and identical probably with a John Tregeagle whose tombstone may
yet be seen in the parish church there, close to the chancel.</p>
<P>Lingering one day amid the venerable arches of that same
church, the narrator, a native of the parish, encountered, near a small
transept called the Trevorder aisle, the sexton, a man then perhaps of about
eighty years of age. The conversation turning not unnaturally on the
&quot;illustrious dead,&quot; the narrator was gratified in receiving from the lips of
the old man the following characteristic specimen of folk-lore, the greater
part of which has remained clearly imprinted in his memory after a Iapse of
many years; though [he thinks he has had to supply the very last sentence of
all from the general popular tradition] here and there he may have had to
supply a few expressions:</p>
<P>&quot;Theess Jahn Tergagle, I 'ye a heerd mun tell, sir, he was
a steward to a lord. [a]</p>
<P>&quot;And a man came fore to the court and paid ax rent: and
Jahn Tergagle didn't put no cross to az name in the books.</p>
<P>&quot;And after that Tergagle daied: and the lord came down to
look after az rents: and when he zeed the books, he zeed this man's name that
there wasn't no cross to ut.</p>
<P>&quot;And he rent for the man, and axed 'n for az rent: and the
man said he'd apaid az rent: and the lord said he hadn't, there warn't no
cross to az name in the books, and he tould 'n that he 'd have the law for 'ii
if he didn't pay.</p>
<P>&quot;And the man, he didn't know what to do: and he went yore
to the minister of Simonward; [b] and the minister axed 'n if he'd a got
faith: and the man, he hadn't got faith, and he was obliged for to come
homewards again.</p>
<P>&quot;And after that the 'Zaizes was coming naigh, and he was
becoming afeerd, sure enough: and he went yore to the minister again, and
tould'n he'd a got faith; the minister might do whatever a laiked.</p>
<P>&quot;And the minister draed a ring out on the floor: and he
caaled out dree times, Jahn Tergagle, Jahn Tergagle, Jahn Tergagle I and (I
've a heerd the ould men tell ut, sir) theess Jahn Tergagle stood before mun
in the middle of the ring.</p>
<P>&quot;And he went yore wi' mun to the Ezaizes, and gave ax
evidence and tould how this man had a paid az rent; and the lord he was cast.</p>
<P>&quot;And after that they was come back to their own house,
theess Jahn</p>
<P>Tergagle he gave mun a brave deal of trouble; he was knackin'
about the place, and wouldn't laive mun alone at all.</p>
<P>&quot;And they went yore to the minister, and axed he for to lay
un. &quot;And the minister zaid, thicky [c] was their look-out; they'd a brought'n
up, and they was to gett 'n down again the best way they could. And I 've a
heerd the ould men tell ut, sir. The minister he got dree hunderd pound for a
layin' of un again.</p>
<P>&quot;And first, a was bound to the old epping-stock [d] up to
Churchtown; [e] and after that a was bound to the ould oven in T'evurder;
James Wyatt down to Wadebridge, he was there when they did open ut.</p>
<P>&quot;And after that a was bound to Dozmary Pool; and they do say
that there he ez now emptying of it out with a lampet.shell, with a hole in
the bottom of ut.&quot;</p>
<P>This is a very ancient idea, and was one of the torments of
the classical Tartarus.The treacherous daughters of Danaus being condemned
therein to empty Leth with a bottomless vessel:-- </p>
<P>&quot;Et Danai proles Veneris quae numma laesit,<br>
In cava Lethaeas solia portat aquas.&quot;</p>
<P>Dosmare Pool is a small lake or tarn on the Bodmin Moors, a
fit representative of Lethe, with its black water and desolate environs.--J.
C. H.</p>
<P>Another correspondent to whom I am much indebted for valuable
notes on the folk-lore of the Land's End district, sends me the following
version:</p>
<P>You may know the story better than I do; however, I 'll
give you the west-country version. A man in the neighbourhood of Redruth, I
think (I have almost forgotten the story), lent a sum of money to another
without receiving bond or note, and the transaction was witnessed by Tregagle,
who died before the money was paid back. When the lender demanded the money,
the borrower denied having received it. He was brought into a court of
justice, when the man denied on oath that he ever borrowed the money, and
declared that if Tregagle saw any such thing take place, he wished that
Tregagle would come and declare it. The words were no sooner out of his mouth
than Tregagle stood before him, and told him that it was easy to bring him,
but that he should not find it so easy to put him away. Tregagle followed the
man day and night, wouldn't let him have a moment's rest, until he got all the
parsons, conjurors, and other wise men together, to lay him. The wise ones
accomplished this for a short time by binding the spirit to empty Dosmery (or
Dorsmery) Pool with a crogan (limpet-shell). He soon finished the job and came
to the man again, who sent for Parson Corker, of Burrian, who was a noted hand
for laying spirits, driving the devil from the bedside of old villains, and
other kinds of jobs of the same kind. When the parson came into the room with
the spirit and the man, the first thing the parson did was to draw a circle
and place the man to stand within it; the spirit took the form of a black
bull, and (roared as you may still hear Tregagle roar in Genvor Cove before a
northerly storm) did all he could to get at the man with his horns and hoofs.
The parson continued reading all the time. At first the reading seemed to make
him more furious, but little by little he became as gentle as a lamb, and
allowed the parson to do what he would with him, and consented at last to go
to Genvor Cove (in Escols Cliff), and make a truss of sand, which he was to
carry above a certain rock in Escols Cliff. He was many years trying, without
being able to accomplish this piece of work, until it came to a very cold
winter, when Tregagle, by taking water from the stream near by, and pouring
oyer the sand, caused it to freeze together, so that he finished the task,
came back 'to the man, and would have torn him in pieces, but the man happened 
to have a child in his arms, so the spirit couldn't harm him. The man sent for
the parson without delay; Parson Corker couldn't manage him alone, this time;
had to get some more parsons to help,--very difficult job;--bound Tregagle
at last to the same task, and not to go near the fresh water. He is still
there, making his truss of sand and spinning sand ropes to bind it. What some
people take to be the &quot;<i>calling of the northern cleves</i>&quot; (cliffs) is the
roaring of Tregagle because there is a storm coming from the north to scatter
his sand. [f] W. B.</p>

<P>[e] Not Ch&#361;rchtown, but Churcht&#243;wn.</p>
<P>[f] In connection with the incident
given of Tregeagle and the child, the following is interesting--</p>
<P>I find in the <i>Temple Bar</i>
Magazine for January 1862, &quot;The Autobiography of an Evil Spirit,&quot; professing
to be an examination of a strange story related by Dr Justinus Kerner. In
this a woman is possessed by a devil or sometimes by devils. &quot;Sometimes a
legion of fiends appeared to take possession of her, and the clamour on such
occasions is compared to that of a pack of hounds. Amid all these horrors
her confinement occurred, which was the means of procuring her some respite,
as the demon appeared to have no power over her while her innocent babe was
in her arms.&quot; T,, this the author adds the following note:-- </p>
<P>This ancient general and beautiful
superstition is graphically illustrated in the legend of Swardowski, the
Polish Faust. Satan, weary of the services the magician is continually
requiring at his hands, decoys him to a house in Cracow, where, for some
unexplained reason, he expects to have him at a disadvantage. Put on his
guard by the indiscretion of a flock of ravens and owls, who cannot suppress
their satisfaction at seeing him enter the house, Swardowski snatches a
new-born child from the cradle and paces the room with it in his arms. In
rushes the devil, as terrible as horns, tail, and hoofs can make hint; but
confronted with the infant, recoils and collapses <i>instanter</i>. This
suggests to him the propriety of resorting to &quot;moral suasion;&quot; and after a
while he thus addresses the magician,--&quot; Thou art a gentleman and knowest
that <i>verbum nobile debet esse stabile</i>.&quot; Swardowski feels that he
cannot break his word of honour as a gentleman, replaces the child in the
cradle, and flies up the chimney with his companion. In the Confusion of his
faculties, however, the demon would seem to have mistaken the way; at all
events, the pair fly upwards instead of downwards,--Swardowski lustily
intoning a hymn till suddenly he finds his companion gone, and himself fixed
at an immeasurable height in the air, and hears a voice above him saying,
&quot;Thus shalt thou hang until the day of judgment!&quot; He has, however, changed
one of his disciples into a spider, and is in the habit of letting him down
to collect the news of earth. When, therefore, we see any floating threads
of gossamer, we may suspect that &quot;a chiel's amang us taking notes,&quot; though
it is not equally probable that he will ever &quot;prent them.&quot;</p>
