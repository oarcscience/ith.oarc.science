### MINERS' SUPERSTITIONS

### MINERS say they often see little imps or demons underground. Their presence is considered favourable; they indicate the presence of lodes, about which they work during the absence of the miners. A miner told my informant that he had often seen them, sitting on pieces of timber, or tumbling about in curious attitudes, when he came to work.

### Miners do not like the form of the cross being made underground. A friend of my informant, going through some "levels" or "adits," made a + by the side of one, to know his way back, as he would have to return by himself.   He was compelled to alter it into another form.

### If miners see a snail when going to "bal" in the morning, they always drop a piece of tallow from their candles by its side.
