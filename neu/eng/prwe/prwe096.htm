<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GARRICK ZANS, OR HOLY ROCK.</p>
<P>FEW years--really but a few years--since, the stone
altars on which the first inhabitants of these islands lit their holy fires
had yet a place amongst us. In the village of Roskestall stood one such altar;
in Treen was to be found another. These huge masses of rock, rendered sacred
by the memories surrounding them, have been wantonly removed, and employed in
most cases in furnishing pillars at the &quot;grand entrances&quot; of the houses of the
squire farmers of the Land's End district; or they have been yet more rudely
served, and are to be found at the entrance to a pigsty, or in the gate-posts
to a potato-field.</p>
<P>The extinction of several of the old families is, to the
present day, ascribed by the peasantry to the unholy act of removing or
breaking up of the Garrick Zans in the village of Escols. The rock in the
village of Mayon was called indifferently <i>table-mayon</i> (m&#246;n), or the
Garrack Zans. Within our memory is the gathering of the villagers around the
Holy Rock. It was their custom, when anything was stolen, or a misdemeanour
committed, to light a fire on this altar, and when the fagots were in full
blaze, all those who sought to prove their innocence took a burning stick from
the rock and spat on the blazing end. If they could extinguish the fire by
spitting on the stick, they were declared innocent; but if the mouth was so
dry as not to generate sufficient moisture to be heard &quot;frizzing&quot; on it, that
unfortunate individual was suspected, if not declared, to be guilty. [a] The
Midsummer bonfire was first lighted on the rock in Escols, next on the Chapel 
Hill; then all the other beacon hills were soon ablaze. Many superstitious
rites were formerly performed on the Garrack Zans, which are only found now as
the amusements of young people on the eves of St Agnes and Midsummer.</p>
<P>[a] Boys at school, to prove the truth or falsehood of any
charge, will take a stick from the fire and practise upon it in the same
manner. May not the custom of joining hands and passing through the embers of
a dying bonfire, for good luck, be a vestige of the same ritual?</p>
