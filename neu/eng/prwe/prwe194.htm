THE GHOST ON HORSEBACK.</h3>
<h3>BILLY--and John --,
working at Wheal Vor, were in the habit, early in the morning, of calling
out a dog or two, kept by the occupier of an adjoining farm, and with them
hunt over the Godolphin warren adjoining. One morning, while thus en&#173;gaged,
one of them gave the alarm that a man on horseback was coming down the road.
"'Tisn't possible," said the other; "no horse can ever come over that road."
"There is a horse, and old Cap'n &nbsp;T. is upon it," replied the first. "Hold
thy tongue," rejoined his comrade; "he 's dead months ago." "I know that;
but 'tis he, sure enough." Both crouched down behind a bush; and my
informant, whose father was one of the parties, declared that the appearance
of Capt. T., on a black horse, passed noiselessly down the road immediately
before them, but without noticing their presence.</h3>
