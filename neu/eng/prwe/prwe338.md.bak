THE following letter, addressed to the publisher of the first and second
editions of this book, will be read with interest :--  
  
263 HAMPSTRAD ROAD, NW., April 18th, 1865  

DEAR MR. HOTTEN,-- I have received your note, in which you express a
doubt as to whether some portion of the public will understand my
representation of the Giant

Bolster."

To all such persons, I would beg of them to reflect, that if a giant
could stride six miles across a country, he must be twelve miles in
height, according to the proportions of the human figure. In order to
get a sight of the head of such a giant, the spectator must be distant a
mite or two from the figure. This would, by adding half the "stride" and
above eleven mites perpendicular, place the spectator about fifteen
miles distant from the giant's head, which head, to proportion to the
other parts of the body, would be about three-quarters of a mile,
measuring from the chin to the crown of the head. Now, let any one
calculate, according to the laws of perspective, what size such a head
would be at such a distance. To give a little insight into the matter of
perspective, let any one imagine that they are looking down a street,
fifteen miles long, of large houses, and then caculate what *size* the
*last* house would be at the farther end of the Street; and it must
therefore be recollected that every part of such a huge body must lessen
in the same way--body and limbs--smaller by degrees, if not beautifully
less.

I selected this subject from, my friend Robert Hunt's work as, one of
the numerous proofs, which are shown in both the volumes, of the
horrible dark ignorance of the Early Ages--a large amount of which
ignorance and darkness, I am sorry to find, still remains. I hope that
these few inns will explain satisfactorily why Giant "Bolster" has been
thus displayed by,

-- Yours
truly,                                                                                                      
GEORGE CRUIKSHANK

P.S.--The first time that I put a very large figure in perspective was
about forty years back, in illustrating that part of" Paradise Lost'
where Milton describes Satan as

"Prone on, the flood, extended long and large,

Lay floating many a rood."

This I never published, but possibly I may do so one of these days.
