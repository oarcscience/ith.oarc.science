<P ALIGN="CENTER">JAGO'S DEMON.</p>
<P>THE vicar of Wendron, who bore the name of Jago, appears to
have had strange intercourse with the invisible world; or, rather, the
primitive people of this district believe him to have possessed supernatural
powers. Any one visiting the parish of Wendron will be struck with many
distinguishing features in its inhabitants. It would appear as if a strange
people had settled down amidst the races already inhabiting the spot, and that
they had studiously avoided any intimate connection with their neighbours. The
dialect of the Wendron people is unlike any other in Cornwall, and there are
many customs existing amongst them which are not found in any other part of
the county. Until of late years, the inhabitants of Wendron were quite
uneducated;--. hence the readiness with which they associate ancient
superstitions with comparatively modern individuals.</p>
<P>The Reverend Mr Jago was no doubt a man who impressed this
people with the powers of his knowledge. Hence we are told that no spirit
walking the earth could resist the spells laid upon him by Jago. By his
prayers--or powers--many a night wanderer has been put back into his grave,
and so confined that the poor ghost could never again get loose. To the
evil-disposed Mr Jago was a terror. All Wendron believed that every act was
visible to the parson at the moment it was done-- day or night it mattered not.
He has been known to pick a thief at once out of a crowd, and criminal men or
women could not endure the glance of his eye. Many a person has at once
confessed to guilty deeds of which they have been suspected the moment they
have been brought before Mr Jago.</p>
<P>We are told that he had spirits continually waiting upon
him, though invisible until he desired them to appear. The parson rode far and
wide over the moorland of his parish. He never took a groom with him; for, the
moment he alighted from his horse, he had only to strike the earth with his
whip, and up came a demon-groom to take charge of the steed.</p>
