RICKETY CHILDREN.

THE practice of bathing rickety children on the first three, Wednesdays
in May is still far from uncommon in the outlying districts of Cornwall.
The parents will walk many miles for the purpose of dipping the little
sufferers in some well, from which the "healing virtue" has not entirely
departed. Among these holy wells, Cubert, just named, is far-famed. To
this well the Peasantry still resort, firm in the faith that there, at
this especial Season, some mysterious virtue is communicated to its
waters. On these occasions, only a few years since, the crowd assembled
Was so large, that it assumed the character of a fair.
