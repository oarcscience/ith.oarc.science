THE FAIRY FAIR IN GERMOE.

  
BAL LANE in Germoe was a notorious place for piskies. One night Daniel
Champion and his comrade came to Godolphin Bridge,--they were a little
bit "overtook" with liquor. They said that when they came to "Bal Lane,"
they found it covered all over from end to end, and the Small People
holding a fair there with all sorts of merchandise--the prettiest sight
they ever met with. Champion was sure he saw his child there; for a few
nights before, his child in the evening was as beautiful a one as could
be seen anywhere, but in the morning was changed for one as ugly and
wizened as could be; and he was sure the Small People had done it. Next
day, telling the story at Croft Gothal, his comrade was knocked
backward, thrown into the bob-pit, and just killed. Obliged to be
carried to his home, Champion followed, and was telling of their
adventure with the Small People, when one said, "Don't speak about them;
they 're wicked, spiteful devils." No sooner were the words uttered than
the speaker was thrown clean over stairs and bruised dreadfully,--a
convincing proof to all present of the reality of the existence of the
Small Folks.
