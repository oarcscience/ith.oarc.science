ST CHIWIDDEN.

THE last Thursday--a clear week before Christmas day --was formerly
always claimed by the tinners as a holiday, and was called by them
White-Thursday (*Jew-whidn*), because on this day, according to
tradition, black tin (tin ore) was first melted and refined into white
tin. From *Jew-whian* to *Chi-widden* 'is an easy transition. Jew-whidn
is a name given to the old furnaces generally called Jews'-houses.
