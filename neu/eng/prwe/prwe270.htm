<P ALIGN="CENTER">CELTS--FLINT ARROW-HEADS, ETC.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;THE common people believe these to be produced by thunder,
and thrown down from the clouds, and that they show what weather will
ensue by changing their colour.</p>
<P>I have also found a belief prevailing in many districts,
that Celts impart a virtue to water in which they have been soaked, and
that diseases have been cured by drinking it.</p>
