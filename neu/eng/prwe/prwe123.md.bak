ST SENNEN AND ST JUST.

THESE saints held rule over adjoining parishes; but, like neighbours,
not unfrequently they quarrelled. We know not the cause which made their
angry passions rise; but no doubt the saints were occasionally exposed
to the influences of the evil principle, which appears to be one of the
ruling powers of the world. It is not often that we have instances of
excess of passion in man or woman without some evidence of the evil
resulting from it. Every tempest in the physical world leaves its mark
on the face of the earth. Every tempest in the moral world, in a similar
manner, leaves some scar to tell of its ravages on the soul. A most
enduring monument in granite tells us of the rage to which those two
holy men were the victims. As we have said, there is no record of the
origin of the duel which was fought between St Just and St Sennen; but,
in the fury of their rage, they tore each a rock from the granite mass,
and hurled it onwards to destroy his brother. They were so well aimed
that both saints must have perished had the rocks been allowed to travel
as intended. A merciful - hand guided them, though in opposite
directions, in precisely the same path. The huge rocks came together; so
severe was the blow of impact that they became one mass, and fell to the
ground, to remain a monument of the impotent rage of two giants.
