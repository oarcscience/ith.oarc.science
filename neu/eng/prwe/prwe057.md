CHENEY'S HOUNDS.

  
IN the parish of St Teath, a pack of hounds was once kept by an old
squire named Cheney. How he or they died I cannot learn; but on "Cheney
Downs" the ghosts of the dogs are sometimes seen, and often heard, in
rough weather.

In the western parishes of the county, I can name several places which
are said to be haunted by the "wish hounds." \[a\]

\[a\] See Athenaeum, No. 1013, March 27, 1847. See Appendix L for Notes
on the BARGEST.
