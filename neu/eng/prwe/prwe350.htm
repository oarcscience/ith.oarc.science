<P ALIGN="CENTER">ST NEOT</p>
<P>THE following account of this celebrated saint, as given
by Mr Davies Gilbert, will not be without interest :-- &quot;Multitudes
flocked to him from all parts. He founded a monastery, and repaired to
Rome for a confirmation, and for blessing at the hands, of the Pope;
these were readily obtained. He returned to his monastery, where
frequent visits were made to him by King Alfred, on which occasions he
admonished and instructed the great founder of English liberty, and
finally quitted this mortal life on the 31st of July about the year 883,
in the odour of sanctity so unequivocal that travellers all over
Cornwall were solaced by its fragrance. Nor did the exertions of our
saint terminate with his existence on earth; he frequently appeared to
King Alfred, and sometimes led his armies in the field. But if the tales
of these times are deserving of any confidence, the nation is really and
truly indebted to St Neot for one of the greatest blessings ever
bestowed on it. To his advice, and even to his personal assistance as a
teacher, we owe the foundation by Alfred of the University at Oxford.</p>
<P>&quot;The relics of St Neot remained at his monastery
in Cornwall till about the year 974, when Earl Alric, and his wife
Ethelfleda, having founded .a religious house at Eynesbury, in
Huntingdonshire, and being at a loss for some patron saint, adopted
the expedient of stealing the body of St Neot; which was accordingly
done and the town retains his name, thus feloniously obtained, up to
this time. The monastery in Cornwall continued feebly to exist after
this disaster through the Saxon times; but having lost its
palladium, it felt the ruiner's hand; and almost immediately after
the Norman Conquest it was finally suppressed. Yet the memory of the
local saint is still cherished by the inhabitants of the parish and
of the neighbourhood--endeared, perhaps,<sub> </sub>by the
tradition of his diminutive stature, reduced in their imagination to
fifteen inches of height; and to these feelings we, in all
probability, owe the preservation of the painted glass, the great
decoration of this church, and one of the principal works of Art to
be seen in Cornwall&quot;--<i>Gilbert's Hist, Corn</i>., vol. iii. p.
