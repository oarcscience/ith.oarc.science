PRUSSIA COVE AND SMUGGLERS' HOLES

SMUGGLERS' hiding-places (now, of course, unused) are numerous. On the
banks of the Helford river are several, and two or three have lately
been discovered on the coast about St Keverne by the falling in of their
roofs. In a part of Penzance harbour, nine years ago, a hiding-place of
this kind was discovered; it still contained one or two kegs, and the
skeleton of a man, with his clothes in good preservation. It is presumed
that the poor fellow while intoxicated was shut in, and the place never
more opened by his companions. Speaking of Penzance,--about fifty years
since, in the back of the harbour, was an old adit called "Gurmer's
Hole," and in the cliff over its entrance, *on a dark night,* a
phosphorescent appearance was always visible from the opposite side. It
could not be seen from beneath, owing to the projection of the face of
the cliff. A fall of the part taking place, the phenomenon disappeared.

Sixty or seventy years since, a native of Breage called" Carter," but
better known, from a most remarkable personal resemblance to Frederick
the Great, as the "King of Prussia," monopolised most of the smuggling
trade of the west. By all accounts he was a man of uncommon mental
power, and chose as the seat of his business a sequestered rocky cove
about two miles east of Marazion, which continues to bear the name of "
Prussia Cove," and where deep channels, cut in hard rock, to allow of
the near approach of their boats, still show the determination of the
illicit traders. Although constantly visited by the excise officers, the
"king" rarely failed to remove his goods, the stocks of which were at
times very large, suffering for a long period comparatively little from
"seizures." On one occasion his boats, while landing a cargo, being hard
pressed by the revenue cutter, Carter had some old cannon brought to the
edge of the cliff and opened fire on the unwelcome intruder, and after a
short but sharp engagement, fairly beat her off. The cutter was, of
course, back again early in the morning, and part of the crew, with the
captain, landed; the only traces, however, of the engagement to be seen
was the trampled ground. On approaching Carter's house, the officer was
met by the "king" himself, with an angry remonstrance about practising
the cutter's guns at midnight so near the shore, and disturbing his
family at such unseemly hours. Although the principal parties concerned
were well known, no evidence could be obtained, and the matter was
allowed to drop. Toward the close of his career Carter "ventured" in
larger ships, became less successful, and was at last exchequered. He
died, at a very advanced age, in poor circumstances.
