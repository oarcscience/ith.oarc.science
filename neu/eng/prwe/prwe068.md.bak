ZENNOR COlTS.

  
TAYLOR STEPHENS, lately deceased, who was for some time the rural
postman of Zennor, sought, in his poem, "The Chief of Barat-Anac," to
embody in a story some descriptions of the Zennor coits and other rock
curiosities.

I employed this man for some weeks to gather up for me all that remained
of legendary lore in Zennor and Morva. He did his work well; and from
his knowledge of the people, he learned more from them than any other
man could have done. The results of his labours are scattered through
these volumes.

C. Taylor Stephens wrote me on the subject of the cromlechs as
follows:--

Superstitious Belief respecting the Quoits.

"I was in the neighbourhood of Zennor in 1859, and by accident came
across the Zennor cromlech, and was struck with the mode of its
construction (not having heard of its existence before), and thinking it
bore some resemblance to the Druidical altars I had read of, I inquired
of a group of persons who were gathered round the village smithery,
whether any one could tell me anything respecting the heap of stones on
the top of the hill. Several were in total ignorance of their existence.
One said, 'Tes caal'd the gient's kite; thas all I knaw.' At last, one
more thoughtful, and one who, I found out, was considered the wiseacre
and oracle of the village, looked up and gave me this important piece of
information,--'Them ere rocks were put there afore you nor me was boern
or thoft ov; but who don it es a puzler to everybody in Sunnur (Zennor).
I de bleve theze put up theer wen thes ere wurld was maade; but wether
they was or no don't very much mattur by hal akounts. Thes I'd knaw,
that nobody caant take car em awa; if anybody was too, they'd be brot
there agin. Hees an ef they wus tuk'd awa wone nite, theys shur to be
hal rite up top o' th hil fust thing in morenin. But I caant tel ee s'
much as Passen can; ef you 'd zea he, he 'd tel he hal about et.'"

In one of the notes received from the poet and postman he gives a
curious instance of the many parts a man played in those remote
districts but a few years since:--

"My venerable grandpapa was well known by all the old people, for he was
not only a local preacher, but a charmer, a botanist, a veterinary
surgeon, a secretary to a burial and sick benefit society, and,
moreover, the blacksmith of the neighbourhood."
