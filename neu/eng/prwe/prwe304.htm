<P ALIGN="CENTER">PECULIAR WORDS AND PHRASES [a]</p>
<P>&quot;THE people in the west,&quot; writes a correspondent, &quot;have I
adopted many words from the Danish invaders.&quot; Tradition assures us that
the sea-rovers of the North frequently landed at Witsand Bay, burned and
pillaged the villages of Escols and Mayon, sometimes took off the women,
but never made a settlement. Certain red-haired families are often
referred to as Danes and the dark-haired people will not marry with &quot;a
red-haired Dane.' He continues :-- &quot;If you were in Buryan Church town this
evening, you might probably hear Betty Trenoweth say, 'I 'll take off my
<i>touser</i> [toute serve], and run up to Janey Angwins to <i>cousey</i>
[causer] a spell; there's a lot of boys gone in there, so there'll be a
grand <i>courant </i>[de courir], I expect.' In a short time Betty may
come back disappointed, saying, ' 'Twas a mere <i>cow's courant</i> after
all, cheld vean--all hammer and tongs.'&quot;</p>
<P>The <i>touser</i> is a large apron or wrapper to come
quite round and keep the under garments clean. By a <i>courant</i> with the boys, they
mean a game of running romps. It is not at all uncommon in other parts of
the country to hear the people say, "It was a
&nbsp;fine <i>courant</i>," "We 'ye had a
good <i>courant</i>," when they intend to express the enjoyment of some
pleasure party. These are, however, probably more nearly allied to
Norman-French.</p>
<P>
There are some proverbial expressions peculiar to the west :-</p>
<P>
"Sow barley in dree, and wheat in pul." [b]</p>
<P>
"To make an old nail good, right it on wood."</p>
<P>
" Fill the sack, then it cars stand."<br>
The last meaning that neither man nor beast can work on an empty stomach.</p>
<P>
The following are a few of less common
expressions, presenting remarkable words :-</p>
<P>
'Tis not <i>bezibd</i>--It is not allotted
me.</p>
<P>
He will never <i>scrip</i> it--He will
never escape it.</p>
<P>

handsome.</p>
<P>
Give her <i>dule</i>--Give her some comfort
or consolation.</p>
<P>
Hark to his <i>lidden</i>--Listen to his
word or talk.</p>
<P>
-&nbsp; It was <i>twenty</i> or <i>some</i>--It
was about twenty.</p>
<P>
The wind brings the <i>pilme</i>--The wind
raises the dust.</p>
<P>

the dust lies.</p>
<P>

from sticks.</p>
<P>

<P>

collar-trees, to which are fastened the rope traces.</p>
<P>
