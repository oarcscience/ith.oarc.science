OXEN PRAY ON CHRISTMAS-EVE.

I REMEMBER, when a child, being told that all the oxen and cows kept at
a farm in the parish of St Germans, at which I was visiting with my
aunt, would be found on their knees when the clock struck twelve. This
is the only case within my own knowledge of this wide-spread
superstition existing in Cornwall. Brand says, "A superstitious notion
prevails in the western parts of Devonshire, that at twelve o'clock at
night on Christmas-eve, the oxen in their stalls are always found on
their knees, as in an attitude of devotion; and that (which is still
more singular) since the alteration of the style, they continue to do
this only on the eve of Old Christmas-day. An honest countryman, living
on the edge of St Stephen's Down, near Launceston, Cornwall, informed
me, October 28, 1790, that he once, with some others, made a trial of
the truth of the above, and, watching several oxen in their stalls at
the above time,--at twelve o'clock at night,--they observed the two
oldest oxen only, fall upon their knees, and, as he expressed it in the
idiom of the country, make 'a cruel moan, like Christian creatures.' I
could not, but with great difficulty, keep my countenance; he saw, and
seemed angry that I gave so little credit to his tale; and, walking off
in a pettish humour, seemed to 'marvel at my unbelief.' There is an old
print of the Nativity, in which the oxen in the stable, near the Virgin
and the Child, are represented upon their knees, as in a suppliant
posture. This graphic representation has probably given rise to the
above superstitious notion on this head."
