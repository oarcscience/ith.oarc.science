BEWITCHED CATTLE.

FARMER, who possessed broad acres, and who was in many respects a
sensible man, was greatly annoyed to find that his cattle became
diseased in the spring. Nothing could satisfy him but that they were
bewitched, and he was resolved to find out the person who had cast the
evil eye on his oxen. According to an anciently prescribed rule, the
farmer took one of his bullocks and bled it to death, catching all the
blood on bundles of straw. The bloody straw was then piled into a heap,
and set on fire. Burning with a vast quantity of smoke the farmer
expected to see the witch either in reality or in shadow, amidst the
smoke.

In this particular case he was to some extent gratified. An old woman
who lived in the adjoining village noticing the fire and smoke, --with
all a woman's curiosity, - went to Farmer --'s field to see what was
going on. She was instantly pounced on by this superstitious man, and he
would no doubt have seriously ill-treated her, had not the poor, and now
terrified, old soul, who roused her neighbours by her cries, been
rescued by them. Every person knew this poor woman to be a most
inoffensive and good creature, and consequently the farmer was only
laughed at for sacrificing thus foolishly one of his oxen.

Another farmer living in one of the western parishes was constantly
losing his cattle in the spring. Many persons said this was because they
were nearly starved during, the winter, but he insisted upon it that he
was ill-wished, and that a blight was upon him.

At length, to break the spell, and discover the witch, he betook himself
to a conjurer' (white witch) who lived near the Lizard Point. This
learned person, of whom several other facts are told in these pages,
told the farmer to bleed the next animal when taken ill, and to receive
the blood upon straw, being careful not to lose any of it. Then the
straw and blood were to be burnt, and whilst the blood was burning he
would be certain of seeing. the witch pass through the smoke.

A young steer fell ill first; it was bled as ordered, the blood caught
upon the straw, and both carefully burnt. While this was going on,
female curiosity induced a poor weak old woman to go into the field and
see what was going on. She was well known to all, and as guiltless as a
child of ill-wishing anybody, but she was seen through the smoke, darted
upon by the farmer, and cruelly ill-treated.
