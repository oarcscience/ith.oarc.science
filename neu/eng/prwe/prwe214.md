DEATH TOKENS AND SUPERSTITIONS.

"Continually at my bed's head  
A hearse doth hang, which doth me tell  
That I ere morning may be dead,  
Though now I feel myself full well."  
ROBERT SOUTHWELL

THE DEATH-TOKEN OF THE VINGOES.

"The messenger of God  
With golden trumpet I see,  
With many other angels more,  
Which sound and call for use.  
Instead of musicke sweet,  
Go toll my passing bell"  

The Bride's Burial.

WWHEN you cross the brook which divides St Leven from Sennen, you are on
the estate of Treville.

Tradition tells us that this estate was given to an old family who came
with the Conqueror to this country. This ancestor is said to have been
the Duke of Normandy's wine-taster, and that he belonged to the ancient
counts of Treville, hence the name of the estate. Certain it is the
property has ever been held without poll deeds. For many generations the
family has been declining, and the race is now nearly, if not quite,
extinct.

Through all time a peculiar token has marked the coming death of a
Vingoe. Above the deep caverns in the Treville cliff rises a carn . On
this, chains of fire were seen ascending and descending, and often
accompanied by loud and frightful noises.

It is said that these tokens have not been seen since the last male of
the family came to a violent end.
