THE NEW MOON.

 

TO see the new moon for the first time through glass, is unlucky; you
may be certain that you will break glass before that moon is out. I have
known persons whose attention has been called to a clear new moon
hesitate. "Hey I seed her out a' doors afore?" if not, they will go into
the open air, and if possible show the moon "a piece of gold," or, at
all events, turn their money.
