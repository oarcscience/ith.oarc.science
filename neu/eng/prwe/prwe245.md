THE ZENNOR CHARMERS.

 BOTH men and women in this parish possessed this power to a remarkable
degree. They could stop blood, however freely it might be flowing. "Even
should a pig be sticked in tie very place, if a charmer was present, and
*thought* of his charm at the time, the pig would not bleed." This
statement, made by a Zennor man, shows a tolerably large amount of faith
in their power. The charmers are very cautious about communicating their
charms. A man would not on any account tell his charm to a woman, or a
woman communicate hers to a man. People will travel many miles to have
themselves or their children charmed for "wildfires" (erysipelas),
ringworms, pains in the limbs or teeth, "kennels" on the eyes
(ulcerations). A correspondent writes me :-- "Near this lives a lady
charmer, on whom I called. I found her to be a really clever, sensible
woman. She was reading a learned treatise on ancient history. She told
me there were but three charmers left in the west,--one at New Mill, one
in Morva, and herself." Their charm for stopping blood is but another
version of one given on another page.

"Christ was born in Bethlehem;  
Baptized in the river Jordan.  
The river stood,--  
So shall thy blood,

Mary Jane Polgrain \[or whatever the person may be called\],

In the name of the Father," &c.
