PETER THE DEVIL.

THE church at Altarnun is said to have been built from the remains of an
ancient nunnery which had been founded in the early days of Christianity
by the saint to whom it was dedicated.

There was a peculiar sanctity about all that surrounded this little
church and its holy well, and few were unfaithful enough to scoff at any
of the holy traditions of the sacred place.

About the time of Charles II., an under-clerk or deacon of this church
was called Peter, and he is said to have been a man of exceedingly bad
character. He scoffed at holy things, and--unless he was belied--he made
use of his position for merely temporal benefit, and was not remarkable
for his honesty. He was, moreover, the terror of the neighbourhood.
Common report insisting on it that Peter had been known to disentomb the
dead, whether for the purpose of stealing rings and other trinkets which
may have been buried, as some said, or for the purpose of renewing his
youth, as others suggested, by mysterious contact with the dead, was not
clearly made out. He was invariably called Peter Jowle, or Joule--that
is, Peter the Devil. At the age of a hundred he was a gray-headed,
toothless man; but then, by some diabolical incantation, he is said to
have caused new black hairs to spring forth amongst those which were
white with age, and then also new teeth grew in his jaws. Peter is said
to have, died when he was more than a hundred and fifty years old.
