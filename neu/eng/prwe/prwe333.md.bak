THE HAG'S BED NEAR FERMOY.

"NEAR Fermoy is a very peculiar variety of these early structures, being
en oblong building constructed with large blocks of limestone of the
locality. It contains an internal chamber, from twenty to thirty feet
long, five feet wide, and at the present time about four feet high; the
side walls are near five feet thick, constructed with two rows of
upright stones on edge, and the interior is filled with smaller stones,
forming a wall; the front has only a row of thin upright stones, but
fitting nearly close together; the covering stones rest on rude
horizontal stones, which are placed on the wall before described, and
which would appear to have been of insufficient height, and on those are
three large covering stones, one of which is about eighteen feet long."
