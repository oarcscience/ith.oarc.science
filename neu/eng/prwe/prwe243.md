CHARMING, AND PROPHETIC POWER.

"The carrion crow, that loathsome beast,  
Which cries against the rain,  
Both for her hue, and for the rest,  
The devil resembleth plain.  
And as with guns we kill the crow  
For spoiling our relief,  
The devil so must we o'erthrow  
With gunshot of belief."  
- GEORGE GASCOIGNE.

 "Late, late yestreen I saw the new moone  
Wi' the auld moone in her anne;  
And I feir, I feir, my dear master  
That we will corn to harme."  
--SIR PATRICK SPENCE.

I CANNOT more appropriately preface this section, than by quoting the
remarks of a medical gentleman in large practice, on the subject of
charms :--

"In common with most of the lower classes of the West of England, the
miner is not free from many absurd superstitions (though I am glad to
observe, even in the last few years, a great change has taken place, and
such follies are gradually declining). Some think themselves endowed
with a species of supernatural agency, and, like the Egyptian alluded to
by Othello, call themselves charmers, and profess to stop the flowing of
blood (no matter from what cause --a divided artery even), to remove
specks from the cornea (which, in the dialect of the country, are called
cannons !), and cure erysipelas, by charming. But I have never been able
to ascertain by what means the charm is supposed to work. I only know
that it is an everyday occurrence for mothers to bring children to the
surgery, afflicted with either of the diseases mentioned, and say that
they have had them charmed; but they were no better, such want of
improvement having obviously excited the greatest feelings of
astonishment. I knew a person connected with the mines, who felt himself
endowed with prophetic powers; and in his case the divination was not
confined to events momentous and terrible, but extended to the most
trifling minutae of life.

"He with grave simplicity told me one day, by way of exemplifying the
proper estimation in which his prophetic powers were held by his wife,
that on one occasion, his pig .having wandered from his sty, she came to
him to ascertain in what direction it was to be sought for; and on his
professing utter ignorance of the animal's peregrinations, she exclaimed
in reproachful tones, 'Ak/you are not so pious as you used to be. I
remem­ber the time when you could have told me in an instant the exact
spot to have found it.'" \[a\]
