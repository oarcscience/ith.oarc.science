THE DEVIL'S DOORWAY.

  
IN the slate (Killas) formations behind Polperro is a good example of a
*fault*. The geologist, in the pride of his know­ledge, refers this to
some movement of the solid mass--a rending of the rocks, produced either
by the action of some subterranean force lifting the earth-crust, or by
a depression of one division of the rocks. The gray-bearded wisdom of
our grandfathers led them to a conclusion widely different from this.

The mighty ruler of the realms of darkness, who is known to have an
especial fondness for rides at midnight, "to see how his little ones
thrive," ascending from his subterranean country, chose this spot as his
point of egress.

As he rose from below in his fiery car, drawn by a gigantic jet black
steed, the rocks gave way before him, and the rent at Pol­perro remains
to this day to convince all unbelievers. Not only this, as his Satanic
majesty burst through the slate rocks, his horse, delighted with the
airs of this upper world, reared in wild triumph, and, planting again
his hoof upon the ground, made these islands shake as with an
earthquake; and he left the deep impres­sion of his burning foot behind.
There, any unbeliever may see the hoof-shaped pool, unmistakable
evidence of the wisdom of the days gone by.
