THE MUTTON FEAST.

 AN old tradition--the particulars of which I have failed to
recover--says that a flock of sheep were blown from the Gwithian Sands
over into St Ives Bay, and that the St Ives fishermen caught them,--
believing them to be a new variety of fish,--either in their nets, or
with hook and line, and brought them ashore as their night's catch.

I learn that Mr Fortescue Hitchins, some fifty or sixty years since,
wrote a "copy of verses" on this tradition, but I have never seen this
production.
