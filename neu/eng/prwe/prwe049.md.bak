THE ADVENTURE OF CHERRY OF ZENNOR.

  
THIS may be regarded as another version of the story of the Fairy
Widower:-- Old Honey lived with his wife and family in a little hut of
two rooms and a "talfat," \[a\] on the cliff side of Trereen in Zennor.
The old couple had half-a-score of children, who were all reared in this
place. They lived as they best could on the produce of a few acres of
ground, which were too poor to keep even a goat in good heart. The heaps
of crogans (limpet-shells) about the hut, led one to believe that their
chief food was limpets and gweans (periwinkles). They had, however, fish
and potatoes most days, and pork and broth now and then of a Sunday. At
Christmas and the Feast they had white bread. There was not a healthier
nor a handsomer family in the parish than Old Honey's. We are, however,
only concerned with one of them--his daughter Cherry. Cherry could run
as fast as a hare, and was ever full of frolic and mischief.

'Whenever the miller's boy came into the "town," tied his horse to the
furze-rick and called in to see if any one desired to send corn to the
mill, Cherry would jump on to its back and gallop off to the cliff. When
the miller's boy gave chase, and she could ride no further over the edge
of that rocky coast, she would take to the cairns, and the swiftest dog
could not catch her, much less the miller's boy.

Soon after Cherry got into her teens she became very discontented,
because year after year her mother had been promising her a new frock
that she might go off as smart as the rest, "three on one horse to Morva
Fair." \[b\] As certain as the time came round the money was wanting, so
Cherry had nothing decent. She could neither go to fair, nor to church,
nor to meeting.

Cherry was sixteen. One of her playmates had a new dress smartly trimmed
with ribbons, and she told Cherry how she had been to Nancledry to the
preaching, and how she had ever so many sweethearts who brought her
home. This put the volatile Cherry in a fever of desire. She declared to
her mother she would go off to the "low countries" \[c\] to seek for
service, that she might get some clothes like other girls.

Her mother wished her to go to Towednack, that she might have the chance
of seeing her now and then of a Sunday.

"No, no!" said Cherry, "I 'll never go to live in the parish where the
cow ate the bell-rope, and where they have fish and taties (potatoes)
every day, and conger-pie of a Sunday for a change."

One fine morning Cherry tied up a few things in a bundle and prepared to
start. She promised her father that she would get service as near home
as she could, and come home at the earliest opportunity. The old man
said she was bewitched, charged her to take care she wasn't carried away
by either the sailors or-pirates, and allowed her to depart. Cherry took
the road leading to Ludgvan and Gulval. When she lost sight of the
chimneys of Trereen, she go out of heart, and had a great mind to go
home again. But she went on.

At length she came to the four cross roads on the Lady Downs, sat
herself dowti on a stone by the roadside, and cried to think of her
home, which she might never see again.

Her crying at last came to an end, and she resolved to go home and make
the best of it.

When she dried her eyes and held up her head she was surprised to see a
gentleman coming towards her;--for she couldn't think where he came
from; no one was to be seen on the Downs a few minutes before.

The gentleman wished her "Good morning," inquired the road to Towednack,
and asked Cherry where she was going.

Cherry told the gentleman that she had left home that morning to look
for service, but that her heart had failed her, and she was going back
over the hills to Zennor again.

"I never expected to meet with such luck as this," said the gentleman.
"I left home this morning to seek for a nice clean girl to keep house
for me, and here you are."

He then told Cherry that he had been recently left a widower, and that
he had one dear little boy, of whom Cherry might have charge. Cherry was
the very girl that would suit him. She was handsome and cleanly. He
could see that her clothes were so mended that the first piece could not
be discovered;' yet she was as sweet as a rose, and all the water in the
sea could not make her cleaner. Poor Cherry said "Yes, sir," to
everything, yet she did not understand one quarter part of what the
gentleman said. Her mother had instructed her to say "Yes, sir," to the
parson, or any gentleman, when, like herself she did not understand
them. The gentleman told her he lived but a short way off, down in the
low countries; that she would have very little to do but milk the cow
and look after the baby; so Cherry consented to go with him.

Away they went, he talking so kindly that Cherry had no notion how time
was moving, and she quite forgot the distance she had walked.

At length they were in lanes, so shaded with trees that a checker of
sunshine scarcely gleamed on the road. As far as she could see, all was
trees and flowers. Sweetbriars and honey-suckles perfumed the air, and
the reddest of ripe apples hung from the trees over the lane.

Then they came to a steam of water as clear as crystal, which ran across
the lane. It was, however, very dark, and Cherry paused to see how she
should cross the river. The gentleman put his arm around her waist and
carried her over, so that she did not wet her feet.

The lane was getting darker and darker, and narrower and narrower, and
they seemed to be going rapidly down-hill.

Cherry took firm hold of the gentleman's arm, and thought, as he had
been so kind to her, she could go with him to the world's end.

After walking a little farther, the gentleman opened a gate which led
into a beautiful garden, and said, "Cherry, my dear, this is the place
we live in."

Cherry could scarcely believe her eyes. She had never seen anything
approaching this place for beauty. Flowers of every dye were around her;
fruits of all kinds hung above her; and the birds, sweeter of song than
any she had ever heard, burst out into a chorus of rejoicing. She had
heard granny tell of enchanted places. Could this be one of them? No.
The gentleman was as big as the parson; and now a little boy came
running down the garden-walk shouting, "Papa, papa."

The child appeared, from his size, to be about two or three years of
age; but there was a singular look of age about him. His eyes were
brilliant and piercing, and he had a crafty expression. As Cherry said,
"He could look anybody down."

Before Cherry could speak to the child, a very old, dry-boned,
ugly-looking woman made her appearance, and seizing the child by the
arm, dragged him into the house, mumbling and scolding. Before, however,
she was lost sight of, the old hag cast one look at Cherry, 'which shot
through her heart "like a gimblet."

Seeing Cherry somewhat disconcerted, the master explained that the old
woman was his late wife's grandmother; that she would remain with them
until Cherry knew her work, and no longer, for she was old and
ill-tempered, and must go. At length, having feasted her eyes on the
garden, Cherry was taken into the house, and this was yet more
beautiful. Flowers of every kind grew everywhere, and the sun seemed to
shine everywhere, and yet she did not see the sun.

Aunt Prudence--so was the old woman named--spread a table in a moment
with a great variety of nice things, and Cherry made a hearty supper.
She was now directed to go to bed, in a chamber at the top of the house,
in which the child was to sleep also. Prudence directed Cherry to keep
her eyes closed, whether she could sleep or not, as she might,
perchance, see things which she would not like. She was not to speak to
the child all night. She was to rise at break of day; then take the boy
to a spring in the garden, wash him, and anoint his eyes with an
ointment, which she would find in a crystal box in a cleft of the rock,
but she was not, on any account, to touch her own eyes with it. Then
Cherry was to call the cow; and having taken a bucket full of milk, to
draw a bowl of the last milk for the boy's breakfast. Cherry was dying
with curiosity. She several times began to question the child, but he
always stopped her with, "I 'll tell Aunt Prudence." According to her
orders, Cherry was up in the morning early. The little boy conducted the
girl to the spring, which flowed in crystal purity from a granite rock,
which was covered with ivy and beautiful mosses. The child was duly
washed, and his eyes duly anointed. Cherry saw no cow, but her little
charge said she must call the cow.

"Pruit! pruit! pruit!" called Cherry, just as she would call the cows at
home; when, lo! a beautiful great cow came from amongst the trees, and
stood on the bank beside Cherry.

Cherry had no sooner placed her hands on the cow's teats than four
streams of milk flowed down and soon filled the bucket. The boy's bowl
was then filled, and he drank it. This being done, the cow quietly
walked away, and Cherry returned to the house to be instructed in her
daily work.

The old woman, Prudence, gave Cherry a capital breakfast, and then
informed her that she must keep to the kitchen, and attend to her work
there--to scald the milk, make the butter, and clean all the platters
and bowls with water and gard (gravel sand). Cherry was charged to avoid
curiosity. She was not to go into any other part of the house; she was
not to try and open any locked doors.

After her ordinary work was done on the second day, her master required
Cherry to help him in the garden, to pick the apples and pears, and to
weed the leeks and onions.

Glad was Cherry to get out of the old woman's sight. Aunt Prudence
always sat with one eye on her knitting, and the other boring through
poor Cherry. Now and then she'd grumble, "I knew Robin would bring down
some fool from Zennor--better for both that she had tarried away."

Cherry and her master got on famously, and whenever Cherry had finished
weeding a bed, her master would give her a kiss to show her how pleased
he was.

After a few days, old Aunt Prudence took Cherry into those parts of the
house which she had never seen. They passed through a long dark passage.
Cherry was then made to take off her shoes; and they entered a room, the
floor of which was like glass, and all round, perched on the shelves,
and on the floor, were people, big and small, turned to stone. Of some,
there were only the head and shoulders, the arms being cut off; others
were perfect. Cherry told the old woman she "wouldn't cum ony

furder for the wurld," She thought from the first she was got into a
land of Small People underground, only master was like other men; but
now she know'd she was with the conjurors, who had turned all these
people to stone. She had heard talk on 'em up in Zennor, and she knew
they might at any moment wake up and eat her.

Old Prudence laughed at Cherry, and drove her on, insisted upon her
rubbing up a box, "like a coffin on six legs," until she could see her
face in it. Well, Cherry did not want for courage, so she began to rub
with a will; the old woman standing by, knitting all the time, calling
out every now and then, "Rub! rub! rub! harder and faster!" At length
Cherry got desperate, and giving a violent rub at one of the corners,
she nearly upset the box. When, O Lor! it gave out such a doleful,
unearthly sound, that Cherry thought all the stone-people were coming to
life, and with her fright she fell down in a fit. The master heard all
this noise, and came in to inquire into the cause of the hubbub. He was
in great wrath, kicked old Prudence out of the house for taking Cherry
into that shut-up room, carried Cherry into the kitchen, and soon, with
some cordial, recovered her senses. Cherry could not remember what had
happened; but she knew there was something fearful in the other part of
the house. But Cherry was mistress now--old Aunt Prudence was gone. Her
master was so kind and loving that a year passed by like a summer day.
Occasionally her master left home for a season; then he would return and
spend much time in the enchanted apartments, and Cherry was certain she
had heard him talking to the stone-people. Cherry had everything the
human heart could desire, but she was not happy; she would know more of
the place and the people. Cherry had, discovered that the ointment made
the little boy's eyes bright and strange, and she thought often that he
saw more than she did; she would try; yes, she would!

Well, next morning the child was washed, his eyes anointed, and the cow
milked; she sent the boy to gather her some flowers in the garden, and
taking a "crum" of ointment, she put it into her eye. Oh, her eye would
be burned out of her head! Cherry ran to the pool beneath the rock to
wash her burning eye; when lo! she saw at the bottom of the water,
hundreds of little people, mostly ladies, playing,--and there was her
master, as small as the others, playing with them. Everything now looked
different about the place. Small people were everywhere, hiding in the
flowers sparkling with diamonds, swinging in the trees, and running and
leaping under and over the blades of grass. The master never showed
himself above the water all day; but at night he rode up to the house
like the handsome gentleman she had seen before. He went to the
enchanted chamber and Cherry soon heard the most beautiful music.

In the morning, her master was off, dressed as if to follow the hounds.
He returned at night, left Cherry to herself and proceeded at once to
his private apartments. Thus it was day after day, until Cherry could
stand it no longer. So she peeped through the keyhole, and saw her
master with lots of ladies, singing; while one dressed like a queen was
playing on the coffin. Oh, how madly jealous Cherry became when she saw
her master kiss this lovely lady! However, the next day, the master
remained at home to gather fruit. Cherry was to help him, and when, as
usual, he looked to kiss her, she slapped his face, and told him to kiss
the Small People, like himself, with whom he played under the water. So
he found out that Cherry had used the ointment. With much sorrow he told
her she must go home,--that he would have no spy on his actions, and
that Aunt Prudence must come back. Long before day, Cherry was called by
her master. He gave her lots of clothes and other things;--took her
bundle in one hand, and a lantern in the other, and bade her follow him.
They went on for miles on miles, all the time going up hill, through
lanes, and narrow passages. When they came at last on level ground, it
was near daybreak. He kissed Cherry, told her she was punished for her
idle curiosity; but that he would, if she behaved well, come sometimes
on the Lady Downs to see her. Saying this, he disappeared. The sun rose,
and there was Cherry seated on a granite stone, without a soul within
miles of her,--a desolate moor having taken the place of a smiling
garden. Long, long did Cherry sit in sorrow, but at last she thought she
would go home.

Her parents had supposed her dead, and when they saw her, they believed
her to be her own ghost. Cherry told her story, which every one doubted,
but Cherry never varied her tale, and at last every one believed it.
They say Cherry was never afterwards right in her head, and on moonlight
nights, until she died, she would wander on to the Lady Downs to look
for her master.
