<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LOST CHILD.</p>
<P><br>
IN the little hamlet of Treonike, in the parish of St Allen, has long lingered
the story of a lost child, who was subsequently found. All the stories agree
in referring the abduction of the child to supernatural agency, and in some
cases it is referred to the &quot;Small People or Piskies,&quot;--in others, to less
amiable spiritual creatures. Mr Hals [a] has given one version of this story,
which differs in some respects from the tale as I heard it, from an old woman
some thirty years since, who then lived in this parish. Her tale was to the
following effect. It was a lovely evening, and the little boy was gathering
flowers in the fields, near a wood. The child was charmed by hearing some
beautiful music, which he at first mistook for the song of birds; but, being a
sharp boy, he was not long deceived, and he went towards the wood to ascertain
from whence the melodious sounds came. When he reached the verge of the wood,
the music was of so exquisite a character, that he was compelled to follow the
sound, which appeared to travel before him. Lured in this way, the boy
penetrated to the dark centre of the grove, and here, meeting with some
difficulties, owing to the thick growth of underwood, he paused and began to
think of returning. The music, however, became more ravishing than before, and
some invisible being appeared to crush down all the low and tangled plants,
thus forming for him a passage, over which he passed without any difficulty.
At length he found himself on the edge of a small lake, and, greatly to his
astonishment, the darkness of night was around him, but the heavens were thick
with stars. The music ceased, and, wearied with his wanderings, the boy fell
asleep on a bed of ferns. He related, on his restoration to his parents, that
he was taken by a beautiful lady through palaces of the most gorgeous
description. Pillars of glass supported arches which glistened with every
colour, and these were hung with crystals far exceeding anything which were
ever seen in the caverns of a Cornish mine. It is, however, stated that many
days passed away before the child was found by his friends, and that at length
he was discovered, one lovely morning, sleeping on the bed of ferns, on which
he was supposed to have fallen asleep on the first adventurous evening. There
was no reason given by the narrator why the boy was &quot;spirited away&quot; in the
first instance, or why he was returned. Her impression was, that some sprites,
pleased with the child's innocence and beauty, had entranced him. That when
asleep he had been carried through the waters to the fairy abodes beneath
them; and she felt assured that a child so treated would be kept under the
especial guardianship of the sprites for ever afterwards. Of this, however,
tradition leaves us in ignorance.</p>
