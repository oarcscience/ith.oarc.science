SAINT GERENNIUS

THIS reached me, at too late a period to be included with the legends of
the saints

:--

"The beacon at Veryan stands on the highest ground in Roseland, at a
short distance from the cliff which overlooks Pendower and Gerrans Bay.
Dr Whitaker, in his 'Cathedral of Cornwall,' states **it** to be one of
the largest tumuli in the kingdom. Its present height above the level of
the field in which it stands is about twenty-eight feet, and its
circumference at the base three hundred and fifty feet; but **it** must
have been originally much larger, as a considerable portion on one side
has been removed, its summit being now about' eighty feet from the base
on the south side, and only fifty feet on the north, whilst the top of
the cairn which was discovered in **it,** and which 'was, no doubt,
placed exactly in the original centre of the mound, is at least ten feet
still farther north than the present summit.

"A tradition has been preserved in the neighbourhood, that Gerennius, an
old Cornish saint and king, whose palace stood on the other side of
Gerrans Bay, between Trewithian and the sea, was buried in this mound
many centuries ago, and that a golden boat with silver oars were used in
conveying his corpse across the hay, and were interred with him. Part of
this tradition receives confirmation from an account incidentally given
of King Gerennius, in an old book called the 'Register of Llandaff.' It
is there stated that, A.D**.** 588, Teliau, bishop of Llandaff, with
some of his suffragan bishops, and many of his followers, fled from
Wales, to escape an epidemic called the yellow plague, and migrated to
Dole in Brittany, to visit Sampson, the archbishop of that place, who
was a countryman and friend of Teliau's. 'On his way thither,' says the
old record, 'he came first to the region of Cornwall, and was well
received by Gerennius, the king of that country, who treated him and his
people with all honour. From thence he proceeded to Armories, and
remained there seven years and seven months; when, hearing that the
plague had ceased in Britain, he collected his followers, -caused a
large bark to be prepared, and returned to Wales.' 'In this,' the record
proceeds, 'they all arrived at the port called Din.Gerein, king
Gerennius lying in the last extreme of life, who when he had received
the body of the Lord from the hand of St Teliau, departed in joy to the
Lord.' 'Probably,' says Whitaker, in his remarks on this quotation, 'the
royal remains were brought in great pomp by water from Din-Gerein, on
the western shore of the port, to Came, about two miles off on the
northern; the barge with the royal body was plated, perhaps, with gold
in places; perhaps, too, rowed with oars having equally plates of silver
upon them; and the pomp of the procession has mixed confusedly with the
interment of the body in the memory of tradition.' "
