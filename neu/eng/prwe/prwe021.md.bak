THE GIANT WRATH, OR RALPH.

  
NOT far from Portreath there exists a remarkable fissure, or gorge, on
the coast, formed by the wearing out, through the action of the sea, of
a channel of ground softer than that which exists on either side of it.
This is generally known as Ralph's Cupboard; and one tale is, that Ralph
was a famous smuggler, who would run his little vessel, even in dark
nights, into the shelter afforded by this gorge, and safely land his
goods. Another is, that it was formerly a cavern in which dwelt Wrath--a
huge giant--who was the terror of the fishermen. Sailing from St Ives,
they ever avoided the Cupboard; as they said, "Nothing ever came out of
it which was unfortunate enough to get into it." Wrath is reputed to
have watched for those who were drifted towards his Cupboard by
currents, or driven in by storms. It is said that wading out to sea, he
tied the boats to his girdle, and quietly walked back to his den,
making, of àourse, all the fishermen his prey. The roof of the cavern is
supposed to have fallen in after the death of the giant, leaving the
open chasm as we now see it.
