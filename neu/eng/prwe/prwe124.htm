<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SAINT AND JOHANA.</p>
<P>THE walls of what are supposed to be the hut of St Leven
are still to he seen at Bodellen. If -you walk from Bodellen to St Leven
Church, on passing near the stile in Rospletha you will see a three-cornered
garden. This belonged to a woman who is only known to us as Johann. Johana's
Garden is still the name of the place. One Sunday morning St Leven was
passing over the stile to go as usual to his fishing-place below the church,
to catch his dinner. Johana was in the garden picking pot-herbs at the time,
and she lectured the holy man for fishing on a Sunday. They came to high
words, and St Leven told Johana that there was no more sin in taking his
dinner from the sea than she herself committed in taking hers from the
garden. The saint called her foolish Johana, and said if another of her name
was christened in his well she should be a bigger fool than Johana herself.
From that day to this no child called Johana has been christened in St
Leven. All parents who desire to give that name to their daughters, dreading
St Leven's curse, take the children to Sennen.</p>
