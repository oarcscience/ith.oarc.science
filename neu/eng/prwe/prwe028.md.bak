THE NIGHT-RIDERS.

I WAS on a visit when a boy at a farmhouse situated near Fowey river.
Well do I remember the farmer with much sorrow telling us one morning at
breakfast, that "the piskie people had been riding Tom again;" and this
he regarded as certainly leading to the destruction of a fine young
horse. I was taken to the stable to see the horse. There could be no
doubt that the animal was much distressed, and refused to eat his food.
The mane was said to be knotted into fairy stirrups; and Mr--told me
that he had no doubt at least twenty small people had sat upon the
horse's neck. He even assured me that one of his men had seen them
urging the horse to his utmost speed round and round one of his fields.
