THE OLD WOMAN WHO TURNED HER SHIFT

  
IN a lone house--situated not far from the hill on which now stands
Knill's Steeple, as it is called--which was then known as Chyanwheal, or
the *House on the Mine*, lived a lone woman, the widow of a miner, said
to have been killed in one of the very ancient "coffens," as the open
mine-workings existing in this hill are termed. A village now bears this
name, but it has derived it from this lone house. Whether it was that
they presumed upon her solitude, or whether the old lady had given them
some inducement, is not now known, but the spriggans of Trencrom Hill
were in the habit of meeting almost every night in her cottage to divide
their plunder. The old woman usually slept, or at least she pretended to
sleep, during the visit of the spriggans. When they left, they always
placed a small coin on the table by her bedside, and with this indeed
the old woman was enabled to provide herself with not merely the
necessaries of life, but to add thereto a few of those things which were
luxuries to one iii her position. The old lady, however, was not
satisfied with this. She resolved to bide her time, and when the
spriggans had an unusually large amount of plunder, to make herself rich
at once and for ever at their expense. Such a time at last arrived. The
spriggans had gathered, we know not how much valuable gold and
jewellery. It gleamed and glistened on the floor, and the old woman in
bed looked on with a most covetous eye. After a while, it appears, the
spriggans were not able to settle the question of division with their
usual amicability. The little thieves began to quarrel amongst
themselves.

Now, thought the old woman, is my time. Therefore huddling herself up
under the bedclothes, she very adroitly contrived to turn her shift, and
having completed the unfailing charm, she jumped from her bed, placed
her hand on a gold cup, and exclaimed, "Thee shusn't hae one on 'em!"

In affright the spriggans all scampered away, leaving their stolen
treasure behind them. The last and boldest of the spriggans, however,
swept his hand over the old woman's only garment as he left the house.
The old woman, now wealthy, removed in a little time from Chyanwheal to
St Ives, and, to the surprise of every one, purchased property and lived
like a gentlewoman. Whenever, however, she put on the shift which had
secured her her wealth, she was tortured beyond endurance. The doctors
and all the learned people used hard names to describe her pains, but
the wise women knew all along that they came of the spriggans.
