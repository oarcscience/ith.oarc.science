ADDERS, AND THE MILPREVE

 THE country people around the Land's End say that in old I times no one
could live in the low grounds, which were then covered with thickets,
and these swarming with adders. Even at a much later period, in the
summer-time, it was not safe to venture amongst the furze on the Downs
without a *milpreve*. (I have never seen a milpreve; but it is described
to me as being about the size of a pigeon's egg, and I am told that it
is made by 'the adders when they get together in great numbers. Is it
not pro­bable that the milpreve may be one of the madrepore corals--
*millepore*-- found sometimes on the beaches around Land's End ?)

 A friend writes me :--" I was once shown a milpreve; it was nothing
more than a beautiful ball of coralline lime-stone, the section of the
coral being thought to be entangled young snakes."

 When some old men were streaming the "Bottoms" up near Partimey, they
were often obliged to leave work on account of the number of adders that
would get together as if by agreement, and advance upon them.

 One day one of the tin streamers chanced to leave his pot of milk,
uncovered, out of the moor-house, when an adder got into it. The man cut
a turf and put over the pot to prevent the reptile from escaping. In a
few minutes the tinners saw "the ugly things crawling and leaping from
all quarters towards the pot." The streamers were obliged to run, and
take which way they would, the adders seemed to be coming from every
direction, further and further off.

 At last "they formed a heap round the pot as large as a pook  \[cock\]
of hay." Towards night all the reptiles were quite still then the men
gathered together, around the mass of adders, a great  quantity of furze
(being summer, there was plenty cut and dry close at hand), and piled it
up like sheaves to make a mow, laying  a circle of well-dried turf
without it. They then fired the turf on every side, and when it was well
ignited, they fired the furze. "Oh,  it was a sight to see the adders
when they felt the smoke and the flame ! they began to boil, as it were,
all in a heap, and fell back  
into the flaming furze ; those which leaped through perishing on the
brilliant ring of burning peat. Thus were killed thousands upon
thousands of adders, and the moors were clear for a long,  long period."

This is related nearly as the story was told ; but it appears necessary
to make some allowance for that spirit of exaggeration which is a
characteristic of all Celtic people, ere they have been  tutored to know
the dignity of truth.  
  
The country people retaine a conceite, that the snakes, by  their
breathing upon a hazel-wand, doe make a stone ring of blew colour, in
which there appeareth the yellow figure of a snake, and  that beasts
which are stung, being given to drink of the water wherein this stone
hath bene socked, will there-through recover." \[a\]  This was clearly
one of the so-called "Druidic rings,"-examples of which may be seen in
our museums,-which have been found in  England and in Ireland. It is
curious that at the glassworks of  Murano, near Venice, they still make
rings, or beads, precisely  resembling the ancient ones, and these are
used largely as money  in Africa.  
  
Snakes were formerly held in great reverence ; and Camden asserts that
one of the prevailing superstitions concerning them was that, about
midsummer-eve, they all met together in companies, and, joining their
heads, began a general hiss, which they continued until a kind of bubble
was formed, which immediately  hardened, and gave to the finder
prosperity in all his undertakings. \[b\]

Lhuyd, in a letter written in 1701, gives a curious account of the then
superstitious character of the people in this district. " The Cornish
retain variety of charms, and have still towards the Land's End the
amulets of *Maen Magal* and *Glain-neider,* which latter they call a
*Melprer*, a thousand worms, and have a charm  for the snake to make it,
when they have found one asleep, and struck a hazel-wand in the centre
of its *spirae*." Camden mentions  
the use of snake-stones as a Cornish superstition.

"The very same story, in fact, is told of the *Alder-stane* in the
popular legends of the Scottish Lowlands, as Pliny records of the origin
of the *Ovum Anguinum*. The various names by which these relics are
designated all point to their estimation as amulets or superstitious
charms; and the fact of their occurrence, most frequently singly, in the
sepulchral cist or urn, seems to prove that it was as such, and not
merely as personal ornaments, that they were deposited with the ashes of
the dead. They are variously known as adder-beads, serpent-stones,
Druidical beads; and, amongst the Welsh and Irish, by the synonymous
terms of *Gleim na Droedh* and *Glaine nan Druidhe*, signifying the
magician's or Druid's glass."--Wilson's Archaeology and Prehistoric
Annals of Scotland, p. 304.
