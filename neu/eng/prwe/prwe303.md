THE FIRST BUTTERFLY

"ONE of the superstitions prevailing in Devonshire is, that any
individual neglecting to kill the first butterfly he may see for the
season, will have ill luck throughout the year." \[a\] The following
recent example is given by a young lady :-- "The other Sunday, as we
were walking to church, we met a man running at full speed, with his hat
in one hand, and a stick in the other. As he passed us, he exclaimed, 'I
shan't hat 'en now, I b'lieve.' He did not give us time to inquire what
he was so eagerly pursuing; but we presently overtook an old man, whom
we knew to be his father, and who, being very infirm, and upwards of
seventy, generally hobbled about by the aid of two sticks. Addressing
me, he observed, 'My zin a took away wan a my sticks, miss; wan't be
ebble to kil'n now though, I b'lieve.' 'Kill what ?' said I. 'Why, 'tis
a butterfly, miss,--the fursi bee 'th a zeed. for the year; and they zay
that a body will have cruel bad luck if a ditn'en kill a furst a
zeeth.'"

I have found this belief prevailing in the east, but never in the west,
of Cornwall.
