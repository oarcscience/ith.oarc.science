<i>
</i>
<P>"THE Celts, or Ke&#955;&#964;&#959;&#943;, or Ke&#955;&#964;&#945;&#943; were a people of the origin
of which nothing positive is known. They occupied a great part of Western Europe
perhaps in times antecedent to the invasion of Indo-Germanic nations.</p>
<P>&quot;The very name <i>Celt</i> is of uncertain etymology. Ammian
derives it from the king, <i>Kelta</i>, or <i>Celta</i>; Leibnitz, from the
German <i>gelt</i>, or <i>geld,</i> money; Mezerai, from the British <i>gall</i>,
or <i>gault</i>, a forest; Pellontier, from the Tudesk <i>wallen</i>, to wander;
Latour d'Auvergne, from <i>gael</i>, or <i>gall</i>, yellow, alluding to the
light hair of the Galli, whom Bochart identtfies with <i>Dodanim</i> (for
Rhodanim) of Gen. x. [a[</p>
<P>&quot;But the name of Cell may probably come, as Camden says, from
<i>gwalth</i>, a head of hair; <i>coma</i>, and <i>gwalthay</i>, <i>comatus</i>;
from whence Ke&#955;&#964;&#945;&#943;. &#915;&#945;&#955;&#964;&#945;&#943;, or &#915;&#945;&#955;&#964;&#959;&#943;,
<i>Galli</i> or <i>Gauls</i>, the <i>Gaedil</i>, <i>Caedil</i>, or Keile, and in pl.
<i>Keilt</i>, or <i>Keiltiet</i>,
or <i>Gaels</i>, <i>Gaedels</i>, or <i>Guidhelod</i>, as the Irish call
themselves and their tongue.</p>
<P>&quot;The language called Celtic is divided into two principal
branches--viz., 1. The Irish or Hibernian, from which the present <i>Irish</i>,
or <i>Erse</i>, and the Gaelic of Scotland are derived. 2. The <i>British</i>,
to which the primitive Gaellic or Gallic are allied, and from which are derived
the <i>Welsh</i>, the <i>Cornish</i>, and the <i>Armoric</i>, or language of
Brittany.&quot; [b]</p>
<P>&quot;The Welsh, which is the relic of the language of the inland
Britons, or Caesar's aborigines, is most probably akin to the dialect of <i>Gallia Celtica</i>, and the Cornish to the idiom of the Belgae, who overran the
southern district of England, and probably sought refuge in the west when the
Saxons were extending themselves from the eastern part of the island.&quot; [c]</p>
<P>But surely there are indications of a people inhabiting
Cornwall long before the Saxons gained a foot of ground in England?</p>
<P>[a] &quot;And the sons of Javan: Elishah,
and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim &quot; (Gen. x. 4</p>

in every Language and Dialect into which Translations have been made.&quot; Bagster &amp;
Sons, 1860</p>

History of Mankind.&quot; By James Cowles Prichard, M.D., F.A.S., vol. iii.
