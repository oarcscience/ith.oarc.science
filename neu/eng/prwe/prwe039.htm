<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE FAIRY FUNERAL.</p>
<P><br>
HIS and two or three other bits of folk-lore were communicated to the <i>
Athaenaum</i> by me, when Ambrose Merton (Mr Thorns) solicited such
contributions.</p>
<P>The parish church of Lelant is curiously situated amidst
hills of blown sand, near the entrance of the creek of Hayle. The sandy waste
around the church is called the Towen; and this place was long the scene of
the midnight gambols of the Small People. In the adjoining village--or, as it
is called in Cornwall, the &quot;church-town &quot;--lived an old woman who had been,
according to her own statement, a frequent witness to the use made by the
fairies of the Towen. Her husband, also, had seen some extraordinary scenes on
the same spot. From her--to me, oft-repeated description--I get the
following tale:-- lt was the fishing season; and Richard had been to St Ives
for some fish. He was returning, laden with pilchards, on a beautiful
moonlight night; and as he ascended the hill from St Ives, he thought he heard
the bell of Lelant Church tolling. Upon a nearer approach, he saw lights in
the church; and most distinctly did the bell toll--not with its usual clear
sound, but dull and heavy, as if it had been muffled, scarcely awakening any
echo. Richard walked towards the church, and cautiously, but not without fear,
approaching one of the windows, looked in. At first he could not perceive any
one within, nor discover whence the light came by which everything was so
distinctly illuminated. At length he saw, moving along the centre aisle, a
funeral procession. The little people who crowded the aisle, although they all
looked very sorrowful, were not dressed in any mourning garments--so far from
it, they wore wreaths of little roses, and carried branches of the blossoming
myrtle. Richard beheld the bier borne between six--whether men or women be
could not tell--but he saw that the face of the corpse was that of a
beautiful female, smaller than the smallest child's doll. It was, Richard
said, &quot;as if it were a dead seraph,&quot;--so very lovely did it appear to him.
The body was covered with white flowers, and its hair, like gold threads, was
tangled amongst the blossoms. The body was placed within the altar; and then a
large party of men, with picks and spades, began to dig a little hole close by
the sacramental table. Their task being completed, others, with great care,
removed the body and placed it in the hole. The entire company crowded around,
eager to catch a parting glimpse of that beautiful corpse, ere yet it was
placed in the earth. As it was lowered into the ground,</p>
<P>they began to tear off their flowers and break their
branches of myrtle, crying, &quot;Our queen is dead! our queen is dead!&quot; At length
one of the men who had dug the grave threw a shovelful of earth upon the body;
and the shriek of the fairy host so alarmed Richard, that he involuntarily
joined in it. In a moment, all the lights were extinguished, and the fairies
were heard flying in great consternation in every direction. Many of them
brushed past the terrified man, and, shrieking, pierced him with sharp
instruments. He was compelled to save his life <i>by the most rabid flight</i>.</p>
