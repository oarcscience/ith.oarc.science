ST NEOT, THE PIGMY.

 WHENCE came the saint, or hermit, who has given his name to two
churches in England, is not known.

 Tradition, however, informs us that he was remarkably small in stature,
though exquisitely formed. He could not, according to all accounts, have
been more than fifteen inches high. Yet, though so diminutive a man, he
possessed a soul which was, giant-like in the power of his faith. The
Church of St Neot, which has been built on the ancient site of the
hermit's cell, is situated in a secluded valley, watered by a branch of
the river Fowey. The surrounding country is, even now, but very
partially cultivated, and it must have been, a few centuries since, a
desert waste; but the valley is, and no doubt ever has been, beautifully
wooded. Not far from the church is the holy well, in which the pious
anchorjte would stand immersed to his neck, whilst he repeated the whole
Book of Psalms. Great was the reward for such an exercise of devotion
and faith. Out of numerous miracles we select only a few, which have
some especial character about them.
