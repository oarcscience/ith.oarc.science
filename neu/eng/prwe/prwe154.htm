<P ALIGN="CENTER">PERRAN WELL.</p>
<P>CHILDREN were cured of several diseases by being bathed
in this well. They were also carried to the sea-shore, and passed through a
cleft in a rock on the shore at Perranzabalo. In the autumn of 1863 I sought
for these holy waters. I was informed that some miners, in driving an adit,
had tapped the spring and drained it. There is not, therefore, a trace of
this once most celebrated well remaining. It was with difficulty that its
site could be discovered. I have since learned that the cut stone-work which
ornamented this holy place, was removed to Chiverton, for the purpose of
preserving it.</p>
