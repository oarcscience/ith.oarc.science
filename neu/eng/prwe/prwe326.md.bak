THOMASINE BONA VENTURE

IN the reign of Henry VI., about the year 1450**,** in the parish of
Week St Mary, on the northern coast of Cornwall, was born of humble
parents a girl, to whom the name of Thomasine was given. This child was
in no way distinguished from other Cornish children; they ever have
been, and still are, remarkable for their healthful beauty, and
Thomasine, like others, was beautiful. Her father was a small farmer,
and the daughter was usually employed in minding the sheep upon
Greenamore, or preventing the geese from straying too far from his
dwelling.

Thomasine appears to have received no education beyond that which nature
gave her. She grew to womanhood a simple, artless maiden, who knew
nothing of the world or its cares beyond the few sorrows which found
their way into the moorland country of Week and Temple.

Thomasine was watching her flocks when a mounted traveller, with
well-filled saddle-bags, passing over the moors, observed her. Struck by
the young woman's beauty, he halted and commenced a conversation with
her. "Her discreet answers, suitable to the beauty of her face, much
beyond her rank or degree," says the quaint Hals, "won upon him, and he
desired to secure her as a servant in his family." This traveller, who
was a draper from London, sought out the parents of the shepherdess, and
proposed to relieve them of this daughter, by taking her to the
metropolis, promising her good wages and many privileges; and beyond
this he agreed that, in case he should die, seeing she would be so far
removed from her friends, she should be carefully provided for.

Having satisfied themselves of the respectability of this merchant
traveller, the parents agreed to part with their daughter; and
Thomasine, full of girlish curiosity to see the city, of which she had
heard, was willing to leave her home.

We next find Thomasine in London as a respected servant to this city
draper. His wife and family are pleased with the innocent Cornish girl:
and by her gentle manners and great goodness of heart, she won upon all
with whom she was brought in contact. Years passed away, and the
draper's wife died. In the course of time he proposed to make the
faithful Thomasine his wife. The proposal was accepted, and "Thomasine
and her master were solemnly married together as man and wife; who then,
according to his promise, endowed her with a considerable jointure in
case of her survivorship." Within two years of this marriage the draper
died, and Thomasine was left sole executrix. The poor servant, who but a
few years previous was minding sheep on the moors, was now a rich widow,
courted by the wealthy of the metropolis. With that good sense which
appears ever to have distinguished her, she improved her mind; and
following the examples by which she had been for some time surrounded,
she added to her natural graces many acquired elegances of manner.

The youth and beauty of the widow brought her numerous admirers, but all
were rejected except Henry Gale, of whom we know little, save that he
was "an eminent and wealthy citizen." He was accepted, and Thomasine
Gale was the most toasted of all city madams. After a few years passed
in great happiness, Thomasine became again a widow. Gale left her all
his property, and she became, when not yet thirty years of age, one of
the wealthiest women in London. So beautiful, so rich, and being yet
young, the widow was soon induced to change her state again. She chose
now for her companion John Percivall, who was already high in the
honours of the corporation.

At the feast of Sir John Collet, who was Lord Mayor in the second year
of the reign of Henry VII., in 1487, Percivall was the mayor's carver,
"at which time, according to the custom of that city, Sir John drank to
him in a silver cup of wine, in order to make him sheriff thereof for
the year ensuing, whereupon he covered his head and sat down at table
with the Lord Mayor of London." John Percivall was elected Lord Mayor
himself in 1499**,** and he was knighted in the same year by Henry VII.
Sir John Percivall and Dame Thomasine Percivall lived many years happily
together; but he died, leaving all his fortune to his widow.

Lady Percivall was now advanced in years. She had had three husbands,
but no children. The extraordinary accession of fortune made no change
in her simple honest heart; the flattery of the great, by whom she had
been surrounded, kindled no pride in the beautiful shepherdess. The home
of her childhood, from which she had been so long separated, was dear to
her, and she retired in her mourning to the quiet of that distant home.

She spent her declining years in good works. Roads were made and bridges
built at her cost; almshouses for poor maids were erected; she relieved
prisoners; fed the hungry, and clothed the naked. In Week St Mary,
Thomasine founded a chantry and free school "to pray for the souls of
her father and mother, and her husbands and relatives." To the school
she added a library, and a dwelling for the chanters and others, "and
endowed the same with £20 lands for ever." Cholwell, a learned man and
great linguist, was master here in Henry VIII.'s time; and here he
educated in the "liberal arts and sciences' says Carew, "many
gentlemen's sons." Such were a few of the benefits conferred on Week by
the girl who once had tended the flocks upon the moors; but who, by
great good fortune and more by the exercise of good sense, became Lady
Mayoress.

Dame Thomasine Percivall died, respected by all who knew her, in
1530**,** having then reached the good old age of eighty years.

It appears probable that the name Bonaventure, by which this remarkable
female is usually known, was given to her, likely enough, by the
linguist Choiwell, to commemorate her remarkable fortune.

Berry Comb, in Jacobstow, was once the residence of Thomasine, and it
was given at her death to the poor of St Mary Week.
