<P ALIGN="CENTER">GOLDSITHNEY FAIR AND THE GLOVE</p>
<P>ON the 5th of August, St James's day (old style), a
fair is held here, which was originally held in the Church-town of
Sithney near Helston.</p>
<P>In olden time, the good <i>St</i> <i>Perran the
Little </i>gave to the wrestlers in his parish a glove as the prize,
and the winner of the glove was permitted to collect the market toll
on the day of the feast, and to appropriate the money to his own use.
The winner of the glove lived in the Church-town of Sithney, and for
long long years the right of holding the fair remained undisputed.</p>
<P>At length the miners of Goldsithney resolved to
contest the prize, and they won it, since which time the fair has been
held in that village, they paying to the poor of the parish of Sithney
one shilling as compensation.</p>
<P>Gilbert remarks &quot;The displaying of a glove at fairs
is an ancient and widely-extended custom. Mr Lysons says it is
continued at Chester. The editor has seen a large ornamented glove
over the guildhall at Exeter during the fairs.&quot; [a]</p>
