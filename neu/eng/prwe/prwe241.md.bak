TOWEDNACK CUCKOO FEAST.

 THE parish feast takes place on the nearest Sunday to the 28th of
April.

It happened in very early times, when winters extended further into the
spring than they now do, that one of the old inhabitants resolved to be
jovial, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season; so he invited all
his neighbours, and to warm his house he placed on the burning faggots
the stump of a tree. It began to blaze, and, inspired by the warmth and
light, they began to sing and drink; when, lo ! with a whiz and a whir,
out flew a bird from the hollow in the stump, crying, Cuckoo ! cuckoo !
The bird was caught and kept by the farmer, and he and his friends
resolved to renew the festal meeting every year at this date, and to
call it their "cuckoo feast." Previous to this event Towednack had no
"feasten Sunday," which made this parish a singular exception to the
rule in Cornwall.

This feast is sometimes called "crowder" feast, because the fiddler
formed a procession at the church door, and led the people through the
village to some tune on his "crowd."
