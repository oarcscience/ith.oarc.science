THE COCK-CROW STONE.

  
A ROCK of white marble (?) with many rock basins on its surface lies in
Looe harbour, under Saunder's Lane, and is now -covered by every tide.
This stone once stood on the top of an elevated rock near it, and when
in this position, whenever it heard a cock crow in the neighbouring
farmyard of Hay, it turned round three times.

The topmost stone of that curious pile of rocks in the parish of St
Cleer known as the Cheesewring is gifted in like manner. Even now the
poultry-yards are very distant, but in ancient days the cocks must have
crowed most lustily, to have produced vibrations on either the sensitive
rock or the tympanum of man.
