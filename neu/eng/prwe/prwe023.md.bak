THE FAIRIES

THE ELFIN CREED OF CORNWALL.

  
 

Elves, urchins, goblins all, and little fairyes."--*Mad Franke,.*

"I do wander everywhere,  
Swifter than the moone's sphere;  
And I serve the fairy queen,  
To dew her orbs upon the green."  
--SHAKESPEARE.

"By the moon we sport and play;  
With the night begins our day;  
As we dance the dew doth fall--  
Trip it little urchins all;  
Lightly as the little bee,  
Two by two, and three by three,  
And about go we, and about go we."  
--LYLIE, *Maydes' Metamorphoses.*

 

"To thee the fairy state  
I with discretion dedicate;  
Because thou prizest things that are  
Curious and unfamiliar."  
*Oberon's Feast* .-- Robert Herrick.

ln the "Fairy Mythology" of Thomas Keightley, I must refer all those who
are desirous of examining the metamorphoses which this family of
spiritual beings undergo, in passing from one country to another. My
business is with the Cornish branch of this extensive family, and I
shall be in a position to show that, notwithstanding Mr Keightley has
entirely excluded Cornwall from consideration, there exists, even to the
present day, a remarkable fairy mythology in that county. Between thirty
and forty years since, ere yet the influences of our practical education
had disturbed the poetical education of the people, every hill and
valley, every tree, shrub, and flower was peopled with spiritual
creations, deriving their characteristics from the physical
peculiarities amidst which they were born. Extending over the whole
district which was formerly known as Danmonium, \[a\] -- embracing not
only Cornwall, but Devonshire, to the eastern edge of Dartmoor, -- we
find a mythology, which varies but little in its main features. Beyond
an imaginary line, drawn in a north-westerly direction from the mouth of
the Teign to the rise of the Torridge, the curiously wild and
distinguishing superstitions of the "Cornwallers" \[b\] fade away, and
we have those which are common to Somersetshire and the more fertile
counties of mid-England.

The Piscy or Pixy of East Devon and Somersetshire is a different
creature from his cousin of a similar name in Cornwall. The former is a
mischievous, but in all respects a very harmless creation, who appears
to live a rollicking life amidst the luxuriant scenes of those beautiful
counties. The latter, the piskies of Cornwall, appear to have their wits
sharpened by their necessities, and may be likened to the keen and
cunning "Arab" boy of the London streets, as seen in contrast with the
clever child who has been reared in every comfort of a well-regulated
home. A gentleman, well known in the literary world of London, very
recently told me, that he once saw in Devonshire a troop of fairies. It
was a breezy summer afternoon, and these beautiful little creatures were
floating on the circling zephyrs up the side of a sunlit hill, and
fantastically playing

"Where oxlips and the nodding violet grow."

They are truly the fairies of " Midsummer Night's Dream." They haunt the
most rural and romantic' spots, and they gather

"On hill, in dale, forest, or mead,  
By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,  
Or on the beached margent of the sea,  
To dance their ringlets to the whistling wind."

No such fairies are ever met with on Dartmoor. A few, judging from Mrs
Bray's tales, \[c\]may have been tempted into the lovely valley of the
Tavy, but certainly they never crossed the Tamar. The darker shades in
the character of the Cornish fairy almost dispose me to conclude that
they belong to an older family than those of Devonshire.

It should be understood that there are in Cornwall five varieties of the
fairy family, clearly distinguishable --

1\. The Small People.

Of the Small People I have heard two accounts. Indeed, it is by no means
clear that the tradition of their origin does not apply to the whole
five branches of this ancient family. The Small People are believed by
some to be the spirits of the people who inhabited Cornwall many
thousands of years ago--long, long before the birth of Christ. That they
were not good enough to inherit the joys of heaven, but hat they were
too good to be condemned to eternal fires. They were said to be "poor
innocents" (this phrase is now applied to silly children). When they
first came into this land, they were much larger than they are now, but
ever since the birth of Christ they have been getting smaller and
smaller. Eventually they will turn into muryans (ants), and at last be
lost from the face of the earth. These Small People are exceedingly
playful amongst themselves, but they are usually demure when they know
that any human eye sees them. They commonly aid those people to whom
they take a fancy, and, frequently, they have been known to perform the
most friendly acts towards men and women. The above notion corresponds
with the popular belief in Ireland, which is, "that the fairies are a
portion of the fallen angels, who, being less guilty than the rest, were
not driven to hell, but were suffered to dwell on earth." \[d\] In
Cornwall, as in Wales, another popular creed is, that the- fairies are
Druids becoming--because they will not give up their idolatries--smaller
and smaller. These Small People in many things closely resemble the
Elves of Scandinavia.

The *Spriggans* are quite a different class of beings. In some respects
they appear to be offshoots from the-family of the Trolls of Sweden and
Denmark. The Spriggans are found only about the cairns, coits, or
cromlechs, burrows, or detached stones, with which it is unlucky for
mortals to meddle. A correspondent writes: "This is known, that they
were a remarkably mischievous arid thievish tribe. If ever a house was
robbed, a child stolen, cattle carried away, or a building demolished,
it was the work of the Spriggans. Whatever commotion took place in
earth, air, or water, it was all put down as the work of these spirits.
Wherever the giants have been, there the Spriggans have been also. It is
usually considered that they are the ghosts of the giants; certainly,
from many of their feats, we must suppose them to possess giant's
strength. The Spriggans have the charge of buried treasure."

The *Piskie*.--This fairy is a most mischievous and very unsociable
sprite. His favourite fun is to entice people into the bogs by appearing
like the light from a cottage window, or as a man carrying a lantern.
The Piskie partakes, in many respects, of the character of the Spriggan.
So wide-spread were their depredations, and so annoying their tricks,
that it at one time was necessary to select persons whose acuteness and
ready tact were a match for these quick-witted wanderers, and many a
clever man has become famous for his power to give charms against
Pigseys. it does not appear, however, that anything remarkable was
required of the clever man. "No Pigsey could harm a man if his coat were
inside-out, and it became a very common practice for persons who had to
go from village to village by night, to wear their jacket or cloak so
turned, ostensibly to prevent the dew from taking the shine off the
cloth, but in reality to render them safe from the Pigseys." \[e\]

They must have been a merry lot, since to "laugh like a Piskie" is a
popular saying. These little fellows were great plagues to the farmers,
riding their colts and chasing their cows.

The *Buccas or Knockers*.--These are the sprites of the mines, and
correspond to the Kobals of the German mines, the Duergars, and the
Trolls. They are said to be the souls of the Jews who formerly worked
the tin-mines of Cornwall. They are not allowed to rest because of their
wicked practices as tinners, and they share in, the general curse which
ignorant people believe still hangs on this race.

The *Browney*.--This spirit was purely of the household. Kindly and
good, he devoted his every care to benefit the family with whom he had
taken up his abode. The Browney has fled, owing to his being brought
into very close contact with the schoolmaster, and he is only summoned
now upon the occasion of the swarming of the bees. When this occurs,
mistress or maid seizes a bell-metal, or a tin pan, and, beating it, she
calls "Browney, Browney!" as loud as she can until the good Browney
compels the bees to settle.

Mr Thorns has noticed that in Cornwall "the moths which some regard as
departed souls, others as fairies, are called *Pisgies*." This is
somewhat too generally expressed; the belief respecting the moth, so far
as I know, is confined to one or two varieties only. Mr Couch informs us
that the local name, around Polperro, of the weasel is *Fairy*. So that
we have evidence of some sort of metempsychosis amongst the elf family.
Moths, ants, and weasels it would seem are the forms taken by those
wandering spirits.

We read in Bishop Corbet, whose work was published in 1648, and was
reprinted many years after by Bishop Percy--

"The fairies  
Were of the old profession;  
Their songs were Ave Ma vies,  
Their dances were procession.  
But now, alas they all are dead,  
Or gone beyond the seas,  
Or, further, for religion fled,  
Or else they take their ease."

Other writers have supposed that at the time of the Reformation the
fairies departed from the land. This hypothesis is not warranted by
evidence. It is possible that they may have taken pos.. session of some
of the inferior creatures, but they are certainly still to be found in
those regions which lie beyond the reach of the railway-giant, with his
fiery mouth, or of that electric spirit who, travelling on his
mysterious wires, can beat the wildest elf that ever mounted
"night-steeds."

\[a\] "If Alfred, as is probable, fixed the limits of Devon where the
ancient eastern boundary was, between the Belgae and Durotriges on the
east, and Danmonii on the west, ancient Cornwall will have included all
Devon, as well as what is west of the Tamar."--Camden's, *Britannia*.
Gough, vol. i.. p. 1.

\[b\] "The 'Cornwallers' overpowered by the Saxons."--Camden's:
*Brtannia*, vol i, p. cxxxix.

\[c\] *Traditions, Legends, Superstitions, and Sketches of Devonshire,
on the Borders of the Tamar and the Tavy*, by Mrs Bray.

\[d\] See Keightley's "Fairy Mythology."

\[e\] The Cornish had formerly a great belief in piskays or fairies. If
a traveller happened to lose his way, he immediately concluded he was
"piskay led." To dispel the charm with which the "piskay-led" traveller
was entangled, nothing was deemed sufficient but that of his turning one
of his garments inside-out. This generally fell upon one of his
stockings; and if this precaution bad been taken before the commencement
of the journey, it was fully believed that no such delusion would have
happened--*Drew and Hitchins' History of Cornwall*, p. 97
