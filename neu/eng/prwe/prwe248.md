A CURE FOR PARALYSIS.

 MARGERY PENWARNE, a paralysed woman, about fifty years of age, though
from her affliction looking some ten years older, sat in the church
porch of St --, and presented her outstretched withered arm and open
palm to the congregation as they left the house of God after the morning
service.

 Penny after penny fell into her hand, though Margery never opened her
lips. All appeared to know the purpose, and thirty pennies were speedily
collected. Presently the parson came with his family, and then she spoke
for the first time, soliciting the priest to change the copper coins
into one silver one. This wish was readily acceded to, and the paralytic
woman hobbled into the church, and up the aisle to the altar rails. A
few words passed between her and the clerk; she was admitted within the
rails, and the clerk moved the communion-table from against the wall,
that she might walk round it, which she did three times.

 "Now," said Margery, "with God's blessing, I shall be cured; my blessed
bit of silver must be made into a ring" (this was ad-dressed to the
clerk, half aside); "and within three weeks after it is on my finger I
shall get the use of my limbs again."

 This charm is common throughout the three western counties for the cure
of rheumatism,--the Devonshire halt,--or for any contraction of the
limbs.
