POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS

IT is, or rather was, believed, In nearly every part of the West of
England, that death is retarded, and the dying kept in a state of
suffering, by having any lock closed, or any bolt shot, in the dwelling
of the dying person.

A man cannot die easy on a bed made of fowls' feathers, or the feathers
of wild birds.

Never carry a corpse to church by a new road.

Whenever a guttering candle folds over its cooling grease, it is watched
with much anxiety. If it curls upon itself it is said to form the
"handle of a coffin," and the person towards whom it is directed will be
in danger of death.

Bituminous coal not unfrequently swells into bubbles, these bubbles of
coal containing carburetted hydrogen gas. When the pressure becomes
great they burst, and often throw off the upper section with some
explosive force. According to the shape of the piece thrown off so is it
named. If it proves round, it is a purse of money; if oblong, it is a
coffin, and the group towards which it flew will be in danger.

If a cock crows at midnight, the angel of death is passing over the
house; and if he delays to strike, the delay is only for a short season.

The howling of a dog is a sad sign. If repeated for three nights, the
house against which it howled will soon be in mourning. A raven croaking
over a cottage fills its inmates with gloom. There are many other
superstitions and tokens connected with life and death, but those given
show the general character of those feelings which I may, I think,
venture to call the "inner life" of the Cornish people. It will be
understood by all who have studied the peculiarities of any Celtic race,
that they have ever been a peculiarly impressible people. They have ever
observed the phenomena of nature; and they have interpreted them with
hopeful feelings, or despondent anxiety, according as they have been
surrounded by cheerful or by sorrow-inducing circumstances. That,
melancholy state of mind, which is so well expressed by the word
"whisht," leads the sufferer to find a "sign" or a "token" in the
trembling of a leaf, or in the lowering of the tempest-clouds. A
collection of the almost infinite variety of these "signs and tokens"
which still exist, would form a curious subject for an essay. Yet this
could only now be done by a person who would skilfully win the
confidence of the miner or the peasant. They feel that they might
subject themselves to ridicule by an indiscreet disclosure of the
religion of their souls. When, if ever, such a collection is made, it
will be found that these superstitions have their origin in the purest
feelings of the heart--that they are the shadowings forth of love,
tinctured with the melancholy dyes of that fear which is born of
mystery.

One would desire that even those old superstitions should be preserved.
They illustrate a state of society, in the past, which will never again
return. There are but few reflecting minds which do not occasionally
feel a lingering regret that times should pass away during which life
was not a reflection of cold reason.

But these things must fade as a knowledge of nature's laws is
disseminated amongst the people. Yet there is--

"The lonely, mountains o'er,  
And the resounding shore,  
A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;  
From haunted spring and dale,  
Edged with poplar pale,  
The parting genius is, with sighing sent."
