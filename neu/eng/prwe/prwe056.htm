<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE WISH HOUNDS.</p>
<P><br>
THE tradition of the Midnight Hunter and his headless hounds--always, in
Cornwall, associated with Tregeagle--prevails everywhere.</p>
<P>The Abbot's Way on Dartmoor, an ancient road which extends
into Cornwall, is said to be the favourite coursing ground of &quot;the wish or
wisked hounds of. Dartmoor,&quot; called also the &quot;yell-hounds,&quot; and the
&quot;yeth-hounds.&quot; The valley of the Dewerstone is also the place of their
midnight meetings. Once I was told at Jump, that Sir Francis Drake drove a
hearse into Plymouth at night with headless horses, and that he was followed
by a pack of &quot;yelling hounds&quot; without heads. If dogs hear the cry of the wish
hounds they all die. May it not be that &quot;wish&quot; is connected with the
west-country word &quot;whist,&quot; meaning more than ordinary melancholy, a sorrow
which has something weird surrounding it?</p>
<P>&quot;And then he sought the dark-green lane,<br>
Whose willows mourn'd the faded year,<br>
Sighing (I heard the love-lorn swain),<br>
'<i>Wishness! oh, wishness</i>! walketh here.'&quot;<br>
-- The Wishful Swain of Devon. By POLWHELE.</p>
<P>The author adds in a note, &quot;An expression used by the
vulgar in the north of Devon to express local melancholy. There is something
sublime in this impersonation of <i>wishness</i>.&quot; The expression is as common
in Cornwall as it is in Devonshire.</p>
<P>Mr Kemble has the following incorrect remarks on this word
:</p>
<P>&quot;In Devonshire to this day all magical or supernatural
dealings go under the common name of wishtness. Can this have any reference to
Woden's name 'wyse? &quot; Mr Polwhele's note gives the true meaning of the word.
Still Mr Kemble's idea is supported by the fact that &quot;there are <i>Wishanger</i>
(Wisehangre or Woden's Meadow), one about four miles south-west of Wanborough
in Surrey, and another near Gloucester.&quot; [a] And we find also, &quot;south-east of
Pixhill in Tedstone, Delamere, there are Wishmoor and Inksmoor near Sapey
Bridge in Whitbourn.&quot; [b]</p>
<P>[a] Kemble's &quot;Saxons in England,&quot; vol.
i., p. 346. Wistman's Wood on Dartmoor, no doubt derives it name from its
extraordinary character. Carrington, in his &quot;Dartmoor,&quot; well describes its
oaks:-- </p>
<P>But of this grove,<br>
This pigmy grove, not one baa dimb'd the air,<br>
So emulously that its loftiest branch<br>
May brush the traveller's brow. The twisted roots<br>
Have clasp'd, in search of nourishment, the rocks,<br>
And straggled wide, and pierced the stony soil? &quot;Around the boughs<br>
Hoary and feebly, and around the trunks<br>
With grasp destructive feeding on the life<br>
That lingers yet, the ivy winds, and moss<br>
Of growth.enormous.&quot;</p>
