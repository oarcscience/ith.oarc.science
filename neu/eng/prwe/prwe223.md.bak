MAY-DAY

THE first of May is inaugurated with much uproar. As soon as the clock
has told of midnight, a loud blast on tin trumpets proclaims the advent
of May. This is long continued. At daybreak, with their "tintarrems,"
they proceed to the country, and strip the sycamore-trees (called
May-trees) of all their young branches, to make whistles. With these
shrill musical instruments they return home. Young men and women devote
May-day to junketing and picnics.

It was a custom at Penzance, and probably at many other Cornish towns,
when the author was a boy, for a number of young people to sit up until
twelve o'clock, and then to march round the town with violins and fifes,
and summon their friends to the Maying.

When all were gathered, they went into the country, and were welcomed at
the farmhouses at which they called, with some refreshment in the shape
of rum and milk, junket, or something of that sort.

They then gathered the "May," which included the young branches of any
tree in blossom or fresh leaf. The branches of the sycamore were
especially cut for the purpose of making the "May-music." This was done
by cutting a circle through the bark to the wood a few inches from the
end of the branch. The, bark was wetted and carefully beaten until it
was loosened and could be slid off from the wood. The wood was cut
angularly at the end, so as to form a mouth-piece, and a slit was made
in both the bark and the wood, so that when the bark was replaced a
whistle was formed. Prepared with a sufficient number of May whistles,
all the party returned to the town, the band playing, whistles blowing,
and the young people singing some appropriate song.
