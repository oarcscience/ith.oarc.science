THE CORNISH CHOUGH.

THE tradition relative to King Arthur and his transformation into a
raven, is fixed very decidedly on the Cornish Chough, from the colour of
its beak and talons. The --

"Talons and beak all red with blood"

are said to mark the violent end to which this celebrated chieftain
came.
