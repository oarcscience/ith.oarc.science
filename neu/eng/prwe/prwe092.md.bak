"THE ISLAND," ST IVES.

   
THE so-called island is now a peninsular mass of clay slate rocks,
interpenetrated by very hard trappean masses. Between this and the town
of St Ives is a low neck of land, which consists chiefly of sand and
gravel, with some masses of clay slate broken into small angular
fragments. On either side of this neck of land are good examples of
raised beaches. Everything, therefore, favours the tradition which is
preserved in the name.

One statement is, that "The Island" was brought in from tile sea;
another, that it rose out of the sea -

"This town, as Mr Camden saith, was formerly called Pendenis or
Pendunes, the head fort, fortress, or fortified place, probably from the
little island here, containing about six acres of ground, on which there
stands the ruins of a little old fortification and a chapel"--*Hals's
Cornwall*.

"On the island (or peninsula) work of St Ives standeth the ruins of an
old chapel, wherein God was duly worshipped by our ancestors the
Britons, before the Church of St Ives was erected or endowed.
"--*Tonkin's Cornwall*.

The beach on one side of the peninsula is called Porthmew, that on the
other Porthgwidden; and the name of the street between them is
"Chyranchy," said to signify "the place of the breach," pointing, it
might appear, to the action of the sea in wearing out the softer ground.

"Chyanchy" is another mode of pronouncing this name, "Chyan" signifying
a house. Hence the name, it is thought by some, was given when two
houses (chy-an-chy) stood alone on the spot. \[a\]

\[a\] Chyanwhael, the house on the mine, is near St Ives. Chyandour, the
house by the Water, adjoins Penrance. Chyangarrach, the house on the
road. The water-elder is called skow-dower.
