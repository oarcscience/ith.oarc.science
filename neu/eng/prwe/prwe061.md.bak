THE MERMAID'S ROCK.

To the westward of the beautiful Cove of Lemorna is a rock which has
through all time borne the above name. I have never been enabled to
learn any special story in connection with this rock. There exists the
popular fancy of a lady showing herself here previous to a storm--with,
of course, the invariable comb and glass. She is said to have been heard
singing most plaintively before a wreck, and that, all along the shore,
the spirits have echoed her in low moaning voices. \[a\] Young men are
said to have swam off to the rock, lured by the songs which they heard,
but they have never returned. Have we not in this a dim shadow of the
story of the Sirens?

\[a\] The undulations of the air, travelling with more rapidity than the
currents, reach our shores long before the tempest by which they have
been established in the centre of the Atlantic, and by producing a low
moaning sound, "the soughing of the wind," predicates the storms. The
"moans of Tregeagle" is another expression indicating the same
phenomenon.
