LIGHTS SEEN BY THE CONVERTED.

 THERE is, in many parts of the county, a belief, derived no doubt from
the recollection of St Paul's conversion, that, when sinners are
converted, they see shining lights about themselves. I have many times
heard this, but every one seems to have his own particular mode of
describing the phenomenon,--where they can be prevailed on to describe
it at all,--and usually that is derived from some picture which has made
an impression on their minds such as, "exactly like the light shining
round the angel appearing to St Peter, in fayther's Bible."
