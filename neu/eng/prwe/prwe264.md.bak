THE MIGRATORY BIRDS.

 I FIND a belief still prevalent amongst the people in the outI lying
districts of Cornwall, that such birds as the cuckoo and the swallow
remain through the winter in deep caves, cracks in the earth, and in
hollow trees; and instances have been cited of these birds having been
found in a torpid state in the mines, and in hollow pieces of wood. This
belief appears to be of some antiquity, for Carew writes in his "Survey
of Cornwall" as follows :--

"In the west parts of Cornwall, during the winter season, swallows are

found sitting in old deep tynne-works, and holes in the sea cliffes; but
touching their lurking-places, *Olaus .Msgnus* maketh a far stranger
report. For he saith that in the north parts of the world, as summer
weareth out, they clap mouth to mouth, wing to wing, and legge to legge,
and so, after a sweet singing, fall downe into certain lakes or pools
amongst the caves, from whence at the next spring they receive a new
resurrection; and he addeth, for proofe thereof, that the fishermen who
make holes in the ice, to dig up such fish in their nets as resort
thither for breathing, doe sometimes light on these swallows conge..lled
in clods, of a slymie substance, and that, carrying them home to their
stoves, the warmth restored them to life and flight."

A man employed in the granite quarries near Penryn, informed me that he
found such a " slymie substance" in one of the pools in the quarry where
he was working, that he took it home, warmth proved it to be a bird, but
when it began to move it was seized by the cat, who ran out on the downs
and devoured it.
