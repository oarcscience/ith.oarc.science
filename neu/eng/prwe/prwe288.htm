<P>
&nbsp;A FOND mother was paying more than ordinary attention to a
fine healthy-looking child, a boy about three years old. The poor woman's
breast was heaving with emotion, and she struggled to repress her sighs.
Upon inquiring if anything was really wrong, she said &quot;the old lady of the
house had just told her that the child could not live long, because he had
a blue vein across his nose.</p>
