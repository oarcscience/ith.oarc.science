THE IRISH LADY

  
NEAR *Pedn-men-dw*, the "Headland of Black Rock," is a curiously-shaped
rock, known as the Irish Lady. In days long ago some adventurous sailors
from Ireland were shipwrecked at night on this rock, and every soul
perished, save a lady, who was seen in the morning sitting on the top of
the rock. The storm was still raging, and it was quite impossible to
render this solitary sufferer any assistance. Days and nights passed
away the people watched the dying woman from the shore, but they could
not reach her. At length they saw that her sufferings were at an end;
and at last the dead body was washed into the sea. Often, when the winds
and waves are high, the fishermen see a lady tranquilly sitting on this
rock, with a rose in her mouth; to show, it may be presumed, her perfect
indifference to the ragings of tempests. \[a\]

Sir Humphrey Davy wrote a poem on this tradition. The following is an
extract from it:--

"Where yon dark cliff \[b\] o'ershadowa the bltte main,  
Theora died amidst the stormy waves,  
And on its feet the sea-dews wash'd her corpse  
And the wild breath of storms shook her black locks.  
Young was Theora; bluer was her eye  
Than the bright azure of the moonlight night;  
Fair was her cheek, as is the ocean cloud  
Red with the morning ray.

" Amidst the groves,  
And greens, and nodding rocks that overhang  
The gray Killarney pans'd her morning days,  
Bright with the beams of joy.

"To solitude,  
To nature, and to God, she gave her youth;  
Hence were her passions tuned to harmony.  
Her azure eye oft glisten'd with the tear  
Of sensibility, and her soft cheek  
Glow'd with the blush of rapture. Hence she loved  
To wander 'midst the green wood silver'd o'er  
By the bright moonbeam. Hence she loved the rocks,  
Crowu'd with the nodding ivy, and the lake  
Fair with the purple morning, and the sea  
Expansive, mingling with the arched sky.

"Dark in the midnight cloud,  
When the wild blast upon its pinions bore  
The dying shrieks of Erin's injured Sons,  
She 'scaped the murderer's arm. \[c\]

"The British bark  
Bore her across the ocean. From the west  
The whirlwind rose, the fire-fraught clouds of heaven  
Were mingled with the wave. The shatter'd bark  
Sunk at thy feet, Boleriutn, and the white surge  
Closed on green Erin's daughter."  
-- PARIS's Life of Sir Humphrey Davy, p. 38

\[a\] This kind of tradition is not uncommon. The following is a welsh
form of it; --

GWENNO'S STEEPLE.

Among the numerous irregular caves at the western end of Ogofau is one
which has derived the name of Ffynnon Gwenno (the well of Gwenno), from
the following tradition, kindly given to us by Mr Johnes. The water
which still occupies its lower part, was, in days of yore, reputed to
possess medicinal qualities, which attracted numerous bathers from the
surrounding districts. Among these a fair maid, named Gweullian, or, for
brevity, Gweuno, was induced, on an unfortunate day, to explore the
recesses of the cavern beyond a frowning rock, which had always been the
prescribed limit to the progress of the bathers. She passed beneath it,
and was no more seen. She had been seized by some superhuman power, as a
warning to others not to invade those mysterious penetralia. And still,
on stormy nights, the spirit of Gweulban is seen to hover over a lofty
crag which rises near the entrance of the now deserted cave, and bears
the name of Cloch ty Gwenno, or Gwenno's Steeple.--*Note on the Gogofou,
or Ogofau Mine*. Memoirs of Geological Survey, vol. i. p. 482.

\[b\] A rock near the Land's End called the "Irish Lady."

\[c\] The Irish lady was shipwrecked at the Land's End about the time of
the massacre of the Irish Protestants by the Catholics, in the reign of
Charles the First. So says Davy--the tradition is very old.
