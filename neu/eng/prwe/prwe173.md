HOW TO BECOME A WITCH.

TOUCH a Logan stone nine times at midnight, and any woman I will become
a witch. A more certain plan is said to be--To get on the Giant's Rock
at Zennor Church-town nine times without shaking it. Seeing that this
rock was at one time a very sensitive Logan stone, the task was somewhat
difficult.
