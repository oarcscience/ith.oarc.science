TABLE-MEN.  
THE SAXON KINGS' VISIT TO THE LAND'S END.

  
AT a short distance from Sennen church, and near the end of a cottage,
is a block of granite, nearly eight feet long, and about three feet
high. This rock is known as the Table-men, or Table-*main*, which
appears to signify the stone-table. At Bosavern, in St Just, is a
somewhat similar fiat stone; and the same story attaches to each. --

It is to the effect that some Saxon kings used the stone as a
dining-table. The number has been variously stated; some traditions
fixing on three kings, others on seven. Hals is far more explicit; for,
as he says, on the authority of the chronicle of Samuel Daniell, they
were --

Ethelbert, 5th king of Kent;  
Cissa, 2d king of the South Saxons;  
Kingills, 6th king of the West Saxons;  
Sebert, 3d king of the East Saxons;  
Ethelfred, 7th king of the Northumbers;  
Penda, 5th king of the Mercians;  
Sigebert, 5th king of the East Angles,--who all flourished about the
year 600.

At a point where the four parishes of Zennor. Morvah, Gulval, and Mathon
meet, is a flat stone with a cross cut on it. The Saxon kings are also
said to have dined on this.

The only tradition which is known amongst the peasantry of Sennen is,
that Prince Arthur and the kings who aided him against the Danes, in the
great battle fought near Vellan-Drucher, dined on the Table-men, after
which they defeated the Danes.
