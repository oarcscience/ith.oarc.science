PENGERSWICK

ANOTHER legend relates that it was not the stepmother found by
Pengerswick whose "skin was covered with scales like a serpent," but
that the lady brought 'home from Palestine by him was an Ophidian--a
serpent-worshipper. Hence she became celebrated as a woman possessed by
a serpent--having a serpent's power--in fact, a Lamia. This is the only
tradition of the kind with which I am acquainted in this county.
