SARACEN

THE term Saracen is always now supposed to apply to the Moors. This is
not exactly correct. Percy, for example, in his "Essay on the Ancient
Minstrels," says, "The old metrical romance of 'Horn Child,' which,
although from the mention of Saracens, &c., it must have been written,
at least, after the First Crusade in 1096, yet, from its Anglo-Saxon
language or idiom, can scarcely be dated later than within a century
after the Conquest." I think this ballad, and several others of an early
date, prove the application of this term to some Oriental people
previous to the Crusades. Soldàin, soldàn, regarded as a corruption of
sultan,--

"Whoever will fight yon grimme soldàn,

Right fair his meede shall be,"

is clearly n much older term, applied to any grim Eastern tyrant, and
especially to the Oriental giants. It would not be a difficult task to
show that the word "Saracen," as used in Cornwall,--' '*Atal Saracen !*"
"*Oh, he's a Saracen !*" &c., was applied to the foreigners who traded
with this country for tin at a very early period.
