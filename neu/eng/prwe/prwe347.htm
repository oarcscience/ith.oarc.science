<P ALIGN="CENTER">ST PIRAN--PERRAN ZABULOE</p>
<P>&quot;IT is rather a curious circumstance,&quot; says Davies
Gilbert, &quot;that the word <i>Zabuloe</i> added to Perran, for the
distinction of this parish, is not Celtic, but through the French <i>sable</i>, from
<i>sabalum</i>, a word frequently used by Pliny, as
indicative of sand or gravel.</p>
<P>&quot;The encroachments of the sand have caused no less
than three churches to be built, after considerable intervals of time,
in this parish. The last was commenced in 1804; and in this year (1835),
a building has been discovered more ancient than the first of these
churches, and not improbably the Oratory of St Perran himself. The
length of this chapel within the walls is 25 feet, without, 30 feet; the
breadth within, 12 &#189; feet; and the height of the walls the same.</p>
<P>&quot; At the eastern end is a neat altar of stone covered
with lime, 4 feet long, by 2 &#189; feet wide, and 3 feet high. Eight inches
above the centre of the altar is a recess in the wall, where probably
stood a crucifix; and on the north side of the altar is a small doorway,
through which the priest may have entered. Out of the whole length, the
chance! extended exactly 6 feet. In the centre of what may be termed the
nave, in the south wall, occurs a round arched doorway, highly
ornamented. The building is, however, without any trace of window; and
there is only one small opening, apparently for the admission of air.</p>
<P>&quot;The discovery has excited much curiosity throughout
the neighbourhood; which has, unfortunately, manifested itself by the
demolition of everything curious in this little oratory, to be borne
away as relics.&quot;--<i>Gilbert</i>.</p>
<P>&quot;Very little is known concerning the saint who has
given his name to the three Perrans. He is, however, held in great
veneration, and esteemed the patron of all Cornwall, or at least of the
mining district.&quot;--<i>Hals</i>.</p>
