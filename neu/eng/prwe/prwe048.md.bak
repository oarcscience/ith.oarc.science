ST LEVAN FAIRIES

  
YEARS since--the time is past now--the green outside the gate at the end
of Trezidder Lane was a favourite place with the Small Folks on which to
hold their fairs. One might often see the rings in the grass which they
made in dancing, where they footed it. Mr Trezillian was returning late
one night from Penzance; when he came near the gate, he saw a number of
little creatures spinning round and round. The sight made him
light-headed, but he could not resist the desire to be amongst them, so
he got off his horse. In a moment they were all over him like a swarm of
bees, and he felt as if they were sticking needles and pins into him.
His horse ran ofl and he didn't know what to do, till, by good luck, he
thought of what he had often heard, so he turned his glove inside out,
threw it amongst the Small Folk, and ere the glove reached the ground
they were all gone. Mr Trezillian had now to find his horse, and the
Small Folk, still determining to lead him a dance, bewildered him. He
was piskie-led, and he could not find out where be was until broad
daylight. Then he saw he was not a hundred yards from the place at which
he had left his horse. On looking round the spot where he had seen the
Small Folk dancing, be found a pair of very small silver knee-buckles of
a most ancient shape, which, no doubt, some little gentleman must have
lost when he was punishing the farmer. Those who knew the families will
well remember the little silver buckles, which were kept for some time
at Trezidder and some time at Raftra.

Down in Penberth Cove lived an old woman who was an especial favourite
with these little people. She was a good old creature, and had been for
many years bedridden. These Small Folk were her only company. Her
relations dropped in once a day, rendered her the little aid she
required, and left food by the bed-side. But day by day, and all the day
long, the Small Folk vied with each other to amuse her. The men, she
related, were for the most part dressed in green, with a red or a blue
cap and a feather--"They look for all the world like little sodgers." As
for the ladies--you should have heard the old woman tell of the gay
ladies, with their feathers, hooped petticoats with furbelows, trains,
and fans, and what saucy little creatures they were with the men! No
sooner was the old woman left alone than in they came and began their
frolics, dancing over the rafters and key-beams, swinging by the cobwebs
like rope-dancers, catching the, mice and riding them in and out through
the holes in the thatch. When one party got tired another party came,
and by daylight, and even by moonlight, the old bedridden creature never
wanted amusement.
