THE DEAD HAND.

"I 've seen it--I've seen it !" exclaimed a young woman, pale with
terror, approaching with much haste the door of a cottage, around which
were gathered several of the miners' wives inhabiting the adjoining
dwellings.

"God's mercy be with the chield !" replied the oldest woman of the
group, with very great seriousness.

"Aunt Alice," asked one of the youngest women, "and do 'e b'lieve any
harm will come o' seeing it ?"

"Mary Doble saw it and pined; Jinny Trestrail was never the same woman
after she seed the hand in Wheal Jewel; and I knows ever so many more;
but let us hope, by the blessing o' the Lord, no evil will come on
Mary."

Mary was evidently impressed with a sense of some heavy trouble. She
sighed deeply, and pressed her hand to her side, as if to still the
beating of her heart. The thoughtless faith of the old woman promised to
work out a fulfilment of her fears in producing mental distress and
corporeal suffering in the younger one.

While this was passing in the little village, a group of men were
gathered around a deserted shaft, which existed in too dangerous
proximity with the abodes of the miners. They were earnestly discussing
the question of the reality of the appearance of the *dead* hand--those
who had not seen it expressing a doubt of its reality, while others
declared most emphatically, "that in that very shaft they had seed un
with a lighted candle in his hand, moving up and down upon the ladders,
as though he was carried by a living man."

It appears that some time previously to the abandonment of the mine, an
unfortunate miner was ascending from his subterranean labours, carrying
his candle in his hand. He was probably seized with giddiness, but from
that or some other cause, he fell away from the ladders, and was found
by his comrades a bleeding corpse at the bottom. The character of this
man was not of the best; and after his burial, it was stated by the
people that *he had been seen.* From a vague rumour of his spectral
appearance on the surface, the tale eventually settled itself into that
of the dead hand moving up and down in the shaft.

By the spectral light of the candle, the hand had been distinctly
visible to many, and the irregular motion of the light proved that the
candle was held in the usual manner between the thumb and finger in its
ball of clay, while the fingers were employed in grasping stave after
stave of the ladder. The belief in the evil attendant on being
unfortunate enough to see this spectral hand, prevailed very generally
amongst the mining population about twenty years since. The dead hand
was not, however, confined to one shaft or mine. Similar narrations have
been met with in several districts.
