THE ST LEVEN STONE.

 On the south side of the church, to the east of the porch, is a rock
known by the above name. It is broken in two, and the fissure is filled
in with ferns and wild flowers, while the grass grows rank around it. On
this rock St Leven often sat to rest after the fatigue of fishing; and
desiring to leave some enduring memento of himself in connection with
this his rude but favourite seat, he one day gave it a blow with his
fist and cracked it through. He prayed over the rock and uttered the
following prophecy :--

"When, with panniers astride,  
A pack-horse one can ride  
Through St Leven's Stone,  
The world will be done."

This stone must have been venerated for the saint's sake when the church
was built, or it would certainly have been employed for the building. It
is more than fifty years since I first made acquaintance, as a child,
with the St Leven Stone, and it may be a satisfaction' to many to know
that the progress of separation is an exceedingly slow one. I cannot
detect the slightest difference in the width of the fissure now and
then. At the present slow rate of opening, the pack-horse and panniers
will not be able to pass through the rock for many thousands of years to
come. We need not, therefore, place much reliance on those prophecies
which give but a limited duration to this planet.
