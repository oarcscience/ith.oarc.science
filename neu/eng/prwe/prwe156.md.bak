HOLY WELL AT LITTLE CONAN

ON Palm Sunday the people resorted to the well sacred to "Our Lady of
Nants," with a cross of palm, and after making the priest a present,
they' were allowed to throw the cross into the well; if it swam the
thrower was to outlive the year, if sank he was not. \[a\]

\[a\] Carew.
