MERRYMAIDS AND MERRYMEN.

THE "merry-maids" of the Cornish fishermen and sailors possess the
well-recognised features of the mermaid. The Breton ballad, quoted by Mr
Keightley, relating to the Morgan (*sea-women*) and the Morverch
(sea-daughters), peculiarly adapts itself to the Cornish merry.maid.

"Fisher, hast thou seen the mermaid combing her hair, yellow as gold, by
the noontide sun, at the edge of the water?"

"I have seen the fair mermaid; I have also heard her singing her songs
plaintive as the waves."

The Irish legends make us acquainted with the amours of men with those
sea-sirens. We learn that the Merrows, or Moruachs, came occasionally
from the sea, and interested themselves in the affairs of man. Amongst
the fragments which have been gathered, here a pebble and there a
pebble, along the Western coast, will be found similar narratives.

The sirens of the Aegean Sea--probably the parents of the medieval
mermaid--possess in a pre-eminent degree the beauty and the falsehood of
all the race. Like all other things, even those mythical creations take
colour from that they work in, like the dyer's hand. The Italian mermaid
is the true creature of the romance of the sunny South; while the lady
of our own southern seas, although she possesses much in common with her
Mediterranean sister, has less poetry, but more human sympathy. - The
following stories, read in connection with those given by Mr Keightley
and by Mr Croker, will show this. \[a\]

'When, five-and-thirty years since, I spent several nights in a
fisherman's cottage on a south-western coast, I was treated to many a
"long yarn" respecting mermaids seen by the father and his sons in the
southern ocean. The appearance of those creatures on our own shores,
they said, was rare; but still they knew they had been seen. From them I
learned of more than one family who have received mysterious powers from
the sea-nymphs; and I have since heard that members of those families
still live, and that they intimate to their credulous friends their firm
belief that this power, which they say has been transmitted to them, was
derived, by some one of their ancestors, from merman or mer-maiden.

Usually those creatures are associated with some catastrophe; but they
are now and then spoken of as the benefactors of man.

One word more. The story of "*The Mermaid's Vengeance*" has been
produced from three versions of evidently the same legend, which
differed in many respects one from the other, yet agreeing in the main
with each other. The first I heard at the Lizard, or rather at Coverach;
the second in Sennen Cove, near the Land's End; the third at
Perranzabaloe. I have preferred the last locality, as being peculiarly
fitted for the home of a mermaid story, and because the old man who told
the tale there was far more graphic in his incidents; and these were
strung more closely together than either of the other stories. \[b\]

Illustrating the Fairy Mythology of Europe," Longman, 1857; "The Fairy
Mythology, Illustrative of the Romance and Superstitions of Various
Countries," by Thomas Keightley; and "Irish Fairy Legends," by Crofton
Croker.

\[b\] The following extract from a letter from an esteemed correspondent
shows the existence of a belief in those fabled creations of the ocean
amongst an extensive class of the labouring population of Cornwall.
There is so much that is characteristic in my correspondent's letter
that it is worth preserving as supporting the evidence of the existing
belief:"

I had the chance of seeing what many of our natives firmly beleved to be
that family. Some fourteen years ago I found myself, with about fifty
emigrants in the Gulf of St Lawrence, on beard the old tub Resolution,
Captain Davies, commander. We were surounded in a fog so thick that you
might cut it like a cheese, almost all the way from the Banks to
Anticosti. One morning, soon after sunrise, when near that island, the
fog as thick as night overhead, at times would rise and fall on the
shore like the tantalising stage curtain. All at once there was a clear
opening right through the dense clouds which rested on the water, that
gave us a glimpse of the shore, with the rocks covered with what to us
appeared very strange creatures. In a minute, the hue and cry from stem
to stern, among all the cousin Johnnys, was 'What are they, you? What
are they, you!' Somebody gave the word mermaids. Old men, women, and
children, that hadn't been out of their bunks for weeks, tore on deck to
see the mermaids, when, alas! the curtain dropped, or rather closed, and
the fair were lost to sight, but to memory dear: for, all the way to
Quebec, those not lucky enough to see the sight bothered the others out
of their lives to know how they looked, and if we saw the comb and glass
in their hands. The captain might as well save his breath as tell them
that the creatures they saw on the rocks were seals, walruses, and
sea-calves. 'Not *yet, Captain* dear, you won't come that over me at
all; no, not by a long chalk! no, not at all, I can tell'e! I know there
are mermaids in the sea; have heard many say so who have sees them too!
but as for sea-calves, I ain't such a calf nor donkey neither as to
believe ut. There may be a few of what we call soils (seals) for all I
know; perhaps so, but the rest were flier-maidens.' No doubt, centuries
hence, this story of the mermaidens will be handed down with many
additions, in the log-huts of the Western States."
