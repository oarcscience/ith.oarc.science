BET TY STOGS AND JAN THE MOUNSTER.

  
IN the "high countries," as the parishes of Morva, Zennor, and Towednack
are called, there has long existed a tradition that the children of
dirty, lazy, "courseying" women are often taken away by the Small
People, carefully cleansed, and then returned--of course all the more
beautiful for being washed by the fairies in morning-dew. This notion
has evidently prevailed for many ages, and, like many an old tradition,
it has been remodelled in each generation to adapt it to the conditions
of the time. The following is but slightly modified in its principal
characteristics from a story somewhat coarsely told, and greatly
extended, by an old woman in Morva. A woman, up the higher side, called
Betty Stogs, very nearly lost her baby a few months ago. Stogs was only
a nickname, but every one knew her by that and no other. It was given to
her because she was so untidy about the feet and legs. She could not
darn a hole in her stocking--the lazy sluit could never knit one. Betty
was always pulling the legs of her stockings down under her feet, that
the holes in her heels might not be seen--as long as the tops would come
under the garter--and she often gartered half-way down the leg to meet
the necessities of the case. Betty was reared up in Towednack, at no
great distance from Wheal Reeth, at which Bal the old man, her father,
worked. He also farmed a few acres of land, and, "out of core," he and
his daughter worked on it. The old people used to say--they wouldn't put
the poor innocent chield to work to Bal, for fear the great rough
heathens from Lelant might overcome her; so they kept her at home, and
the old man would brag how his Betty could cut furze and turf. Instead
of staying at home in the evenings, Betty was always racing round the
lanes to class-meetings; for she had been a "professor ever since' she
was a chield." Betty was an only child, and the old people had saved a
little money, and they hoped some one "above the common" would marry
her. In Higher Side there lived a man called Jan the Mounster (monster),
and, tempted by the bit of money, he resolved to lay himself out to
catch Betty. Jan became a converted character--he met in the same class
with Betty, a expressed himself as being "so fond of the means of
grace." Things went on in this way for some time, and it was found that
Betty "had met with a misfortune." The old people were now in a great
hurry to marry their daughter, and promised Jan money enough. to buy a
set of cheene (china), and lots of beautiful clome (earthenware); but
Mounster required more than this, and fought off. He left the "people,"
that he mightn't be read out. He said he was heartily sick of the lot,
told strange stories about their doings, and became as bad a character
as ever. Time advanced, and Betty 's mother--who was herself a
wretchedly dirty woman, and, as people said, too fond of the "drop of
drink "-- saw that she must lose no chance of making her daughter an
honest woman. So she went to Penzance and bought a new bed--a real
four-poster--a new dresser, painted bright lead and liver colour--an
eight-day clock, in a painted mahogany case--a mass of beautiful
clome--and a glass milk-cup. When all these things were ranged in
cottage, Jan was well enough pleased with them, and hung his "great
turnip of a watch" up in the middle of the dresser, to see how it would
look. When he had satisfied himself he told the old woman he would marry
Betty out of hand, if she would give them their great pretty, bright,
warming-pan to hang opposite the door. This was soon settled, and Jan
the Mounster and Betty Stogs were married.

In a little time the voice of a baby was heard in Jan's cottage, but the
poor child had no cradle, only a "costan" (a straw and bramble basket);
and, in addition to the ordinary causes of neglect, another cause was
introduced--Betty took to drink. A great, nasty suss of a woman, who
went about pretending to sell crochet-work, but in reality to sell gin
-- which she kept in a bottle under the dirty rags, which she called
"the most beautiful croshar-work collars and cuffs, that all the ladies
in the towns and up the country wear on Sundays and high holidays
"--formed a close acquaintance with Jan's wife. The result was, things
went from bad to worse. Jan was discontented, and went to Bal, and
returned from Bal always a sullen man. One day Betty had to bake some
bread--she had never before done so, as her mother had always attended
to that job. Jan had left his watch hanging to the dresser, that Betty
might know the time. All went well till the middle of the day; and, just
as the bread was ready to put down, in came the crochet-woman. First
Betty had a noggin of gin--she then had her fortune told -- and because
she was promised no end of good luck and the handsomest children in the
country, and Jan the best luck in tribute-pitches, the kettle was
boiled, and some pork fried for the fortune-teller.

All this time the dough was forgotten, and it was getting sour and
heavy. At last, when the woman went away, the lump of sour "leven" was
put down to bake. The neglected child got troublesome, and as Jan would
be home early to supper, Betty was in a great hurry to get things done.
To quiet the child, she gave it Jan's watch; and, that it might be the
better pleased, she opened it, "that the dear chield might see the
pretty little wheels spinning round." In a short time the "machine" was
thrown down in the ashes, and it, of course, stopped. Betty, at last,
wished to know the time; she then found the watch clogged full of dirt.
To put the thing to rights she washed it out in the kettle of
dish-water, which had not been changed for two or three days, and was
thick with salt pilchard-bones, and potato-skins. She did her best to
clean the watch, for she was now terribly afraid of Jan, and she wiped
all the little wheels, as far as she could reach, with the corner of the
dishcloth, but the confounded thing would not go. She had to bake the
bread by guess; and, therefore, when she took it up, it was as black as
soot, and as hard as a stone.

Jan came home; and you may judge the temper he was in at finding things
as they were, and his watch stopped. Betty swore to the deepest that she
had never taken the thing into her hands. Next morning Jan got up early
to go to Bal; and taking the burnt loaf, he tried to cut it with a
knife, but it was in vain--as well try to cut a stone; next he tried the
dag (axe), and Mounster said it strook fire, and the dag never made the
least mark in the crust.

The poor fellow had to go to his work without his breakfast, and to
depend upon the share of a comrade's fuggun for dinner.

Next day, Friday, was pay-day, and Jan having got his pay, went to St
Ives for bread, and took the precious watch with him to be set to
rights. The watchmaker soon found out the complaint; here was a bit of
fish-bone, there a piece of potato-paring; in one tooth a piece of
worsted from a dishcloth, in another a particle of straw, and ashes
everywhere.

The murder was out; and that night Jan, having first drunk to excess in
St Ives, went home and nearly murdered his wife. From this time Jan was
drunk every day, and Betty was so as often as she could get gin. The
poor child was left half the day to suck his thumbs, and to tumble and
loss on the filthy rags in the old costan, without any one to look after
it.

One day Betty was in a "courseying" mood, and went from house to house,
wherever she could find a woman idle enough to gossip with her. Betty
stayed away till dark--it was Jan's last core by day--and the poor child
was left all alone.

When she came home she was surprised not to hear the child, but she
thought it might have cried itself to sleep, and was not concerned. At
last, having lit the candle, she looked in the costan, and there was no
child to be seen. Betty searched about, in and out, every place she
could think of; still there were no signs of the child. This pretty well
sobered Betty, and she remembered that she had to unlock the door to get
into the cottage.

While yet full of fear and trembling to meet her husband, Jan came home
from Bal. He was, of course, told that his "croom of a chield was lost."
He didn't believe a word of what Betty told him, but he went about and
called up all the neighbours, who joined him in the search. They spent
the night in examining every spot around the house and in the
village--all in vain.

After daybreak they were all assembled in deep and earnest consultation,
when the cat came running into the house, with her tail on end, and
mewing anxiously. She ran forth and back round a brake of furze,
constantly crying, as if she wished the people to follow her. After a
long time some one thought of going after the cat, and in the middle of
the furze-brake, on a beautiful green, soft spot of mossy grass, was the
baby sleeping, "as sweet as a little nut," wrapped carefully up in some
old dry gowns, and all its clothes clean and dry. When they unwrapped
the child, they found he was covered over with bright flowers, as we
place them round a babe in the coffin. He had a bunch of violets in his
dear little hands, and there were wallflowers and primroses, and balm
and mint spread over his body. The furze was high all around, so that no
cold wind could reach the infant. Every one declared that the child
never looked so handsome before. It was plain enough, said the old
women, that the Small People had taken the child and washed it from top
to toe; that their task of cleansing the babe was a long one, and that
the sun arose before they could finish it; that they had placed the
child where it was found, intending to take it away the next night.

They were never known to come for the babe, but every one said that this
affair worked a great change in Betty Stogs and in Jan the Mounster. The
cottage was kept tidy, the child clean; and its father and mother drank
less, and lived happier, for ever afterwards.
