<P ALIGN="CENTER">ST MARGERY AND THE PISKIES.</p>
<P><br>
WE have no reliable information of the birth, parentage, or education of
Margery Daw, but we have a nursery rhyme which clearly indicates that she must
have been a sloven--perhaps an ancient picture of a literary lady, who was by
her sad habit reduced to extreme necessity.</p>
<P>See saw, Margery Daw,</p>
<P>clearly indicates a lazy woman rocking herself either in deep
thought, or for want of thought.</p>
<P>Sold her bed and lay on the straw;</p>
<P>this was stage the first of her degradation. She sold her
straw and lay in the smut, the second and final stage, which may well induce
the poet to inquire--</p>
<P>Was not she a dirty slut?</p>
<P>Another version of Margery's story is more distinct as to her</p>
<P>See saw,<br>
Margery Daw,<br>
Sold her bed<br>
And lay on the straw;<br>
She sold her straw,<br>
And lay upon hay,<br>
So <i>piskies</i> came<br>
And carried her away.</p>
<P>A friend, in writing to me on this dirty Cornish saint, is
disposed to regard St Margery Daw as a very devout Roman Catholic, and to
refer the version of her story which I have given first to the strong feeling
shown by many Protestants against those pious women who rejected the finery of
the world, and submitted for the sake of their souls to those privations which
formed at one time the severe rule of conventual life. Margery and the fairies
are supposed to have left England together at the time of the Reformation, but
she has left her name to several Cornish mines.</p>
