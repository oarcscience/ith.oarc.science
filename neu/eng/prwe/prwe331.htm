<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE POEM OF THE WRESTLING*</p>
<P>lt may be here remarked as something more than
accidental, that Magog is a well.known Oriental giant, that Gog and
Magog figure in the Guildhall of London, and that Gogmagog was the
champion selected for a trial of strength with Corineus.</p>
<P>&quot;Amongst
the ragged Cleeves those monstrous giants sought:</p>
<P>Who (of
their dreadful kind) t' appal the Trojans brought</p>
<P>Great <i>
Gogmagog, </i>an oake that by the roots could teare;</p>
<P>So
mighty were (that time) the men who lived there:</p>
<P>But, for
the use of armes he did not understand</p>
<P>(Except
some rock or tree, that coming next to hand,</p>
<P>He
raised out of the earth to execute his rage),</p>
<P>He
challenge makes for strength, and offereth there his gage,</p>
<P>Which <i>
Corin </i>taketh up, to answer by and by,</p>
<P>Upon
this sonne of earth his utmost power to try. <br>
All, doubtful to which port the victory should goe,</p>
<P>Upon
that loftie place at <i>Plimmouth, </i>called the <i>Hoe,</p>
</i>
<P>Those
mightie wrastlers met with many an irefull looke,</p>
<P>Who
threat'ned as the one hold of the other tooke:</p>
<P>But,
grappled, glowing fire shines in their sparkling eyes,</p>
<P>And,
whilst at length of arme one from the other lyes,</p>
<P>Their
lusty sinewes swell like cables, as they strive.</p>
<P>Their
feet such trampling make, as though they forced to drive</p>
<P>A
thunder out of earth, which stagger'd with the weight:</p>
<P>Thus
either's utmost force urged to the greatest height.</p>
<P>Whilst
one upon his hips the other seeks to lift,</p>
<P>And th'
adverse (by a turn) doth from his cunning shift,</p>
<P>Their
short-fetcht troubled breath a hollow noise doth make,</p>
<P>Like
bellows of a forge. Their Corin up doth take</p>
<P>The
giant 'twixt the groins; and voiding of his hold</p>
<P>(Before
his cumbrous feet he well recover could),</p>
<P>
Pitcht headlong from the bill: as when a man doth throw</p>
<P>An
axtree. that with slight delivered from the toe</p>
<P>Roots
up the yielding earth, so that his violent fall,</p>
<P>Shook
Neptune with such strength as shoulder'd him withal</p>
<P>That
where the monstrous waves like mountains late did stand,</p>
<P>They
leapt out of the place, and left the bared sand</p>
<P>To
gaze upon wide heaven, so great a blow it gave.</p>
<P>For
which the conquering Brute on Corineus brave</p>
<P>This
horn of land bestow'd, and markt it with his name</p>
<P>Of
Corin, Cornwal call'd to his immortal fame.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>In 1750 Robert Heath published his &quot;Natural and
Historical Account of the Islands of Scilly,&quot; to which was added &quot;A General
Account of Cornwall.&quot; From paragraphs in this work it may be inferred that
the figures of the wrestlers cut out in the turf on Plymouth Hoe then
existed.</p>
<P>&quot;The activity of the <i>Cornish</i> and <i>Devonshire</i>
men, beyond others in the faculty of Wrestling, seems to derive their
Pedigree from that grand Wrestler, Corineus. That there has been such a
giant as Gogmagog, opposed by Corineus, the inhabitants of <i>Plymouth</i>
show you a Portraiture of two Men, one bigger than the other, with Clubs in
their hands, cut out upon the Raw-ground, which have been renewed by order
of the Place, as they wear out; and a steep cliff being-near, over which the
giant might be thrown, are said to point out together the Probability of the
Fact.&quot;</p>
<P>In the &quot;Dissertation on the Cornish Tongue,&quot; by William
Scawen, Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, we find the following passage : &quot;I
cannot affirm with so much reason, its some of our neighbours have done with
confidence, who say that at the last digging on the Haw for the foundation
of the citadel of Plymouth, the great jaws and teeth therein found were
those of Gogmagog, who was there said to be thrown down by Corineus, whom
some will have to be the founder of the Cornish; [b] nor am I able to assert
that some instruments of war in brass, and huge limbs and por. traitures of
persons long ago, as some say that have been in some of the western
parishes, were parts of giants or other great men, who had formerly had
their being there.&quot;</p>
<P>[a] See also Hogg's &quot;Records of
Ancient Cornwall.&quot;<br>
</p>
<P>[b] <i>This note is by the Editor</i>,
Mr. Davies Gilbert : &quot;These bones must evidently have been found in a
cavern, the nature of which has been most ably ascertained and described by
Dr. Buckland and the Rev. Richard Hannah, who examined other caverns of
precisely the same nature, comprising bones of various larger mammalia, in
the limestone formation not far from Plymouth.&quot;</p>
<P>Thus we see the poetical belief of
one age destroyed by the positive philosophy of the next. Happily, we move
in all things by waves; the system of undulations prevails in every
operation, mental and physical. Amidst the relics of the mammalia of the
Devonshire caves we are now discovering the unmistakable remains of man, and
his works,--stone knives, spear-heads, axes, and hammers speak of an
ancient race; and 'nay there not have been <i>
&quot;giants in the earth in those days, and also after that?&quot;</p>
