<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PISKIES' CHANGELING.</p>
<P><br>
THIS story is told by Mr T. Q. Couch, as an example of the folk-lore of a
Cornish village, in &quot;Notes and Queries,&quot; under the name of&quot; Coleman Gray: &quot;-- </p>
<P>&quot;There is a farmhouse of some antiquity with which my family
have a close connection; and it is this circumstance, more than any other,
that has rendered this tradition concerning it more interesting to us, and
better remembered than many other equally romantic and authentic. Close to
this house, one day, a little miserable-looking banding was discovered alone,
unknown, and incapable of making its wants understood. It was instantly
remembered by the finder, that this was the way in which the piskies were
accustomed to deal with those infants of their race for whom they sought human
protection; and it would have been an awful circumstance if such a one were
not received by the individual so visited. The anger of the piskies would be
certain, and some direful calamity must be the result; whereas, a kind welcome
would probably be attended with great good fortune. The miserable plight of
this stranger, therefore, attracted attention and sympathy. The little
unconscious one was admitted as one of the family. Its health was speedily
restored, and its renewed strength, activity, intelligence, and good-humour,
caused it to become a general favourite. It is true the stranger was often
found to indulge in odd freaks; but this was accounted for by a recollection
of its pedigree, which was not doubted to be of the piskie order. So the
family prospered, and had banished the thought that the foundling would ever
leave them. There was to the front door of this house, a hatch, which is a
half-door, that is kept closed when the whole door behind it is open, and it
then serves as a guard against the intrusion of dogs, hogs, and ducks, while
air and light are freely admitted. This little being was one day leaning over
the top of this hatch, and looking wistfully outward, when a clear voice was
heard to proceed from a neighbouring part of the <i>townplace</i>, calling,
'Coleman Gray, Coleman Gray!' The piskie immediately started up, and with a
sudden laugh, clapped its hands, exclaiming, 'Aha! my daddy is come!' It was
gone in a moment, never to be seen again.&quot;</p>
