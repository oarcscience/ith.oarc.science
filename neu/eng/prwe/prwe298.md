UNLUCKY THINGS

TO put the loaf on the table upside down--to cut the butter at both
ends--to place the bellows on the table--to upset the salt--to cross
your knife and fork--to pour gravy out of a spoon backwards (or
back-handed), is each unlucky and leads to quarrels. To borrow or lend a
bellows is most unlucky, and many would rather give than lend one.

If you are going on an errand, never turn back to your house, it
presages ill luck to do so. If however, you are compelled to it, fail
not to sit down. By doing this some mischief may be avoided.
