ROMANCES OF WITCHES, ETC.

"And wow ! Tam saw an unco sight -  
Warlocks and witches in a dance."  
Tam o' Shanter - BURNS

THE "CUNNING MAN."

"And as he rode over the more,  
Hoe see a lady where shee sate  
Betwixt an oke and a greene hollen;  
She was cladd in red scarlett.

"Then there as shold have stood her mouth,  
Then there was sett her eye;  
The other was in her forehead fast,  
The way that she might seee.

"Her nose was crook'd and turn'd outward,  
Her mouth stood foule awry;  
A worse-form'd lady then shee was,  
Never man saw with his eye."

*The Marriage* *of Sir Gawaine.*

THAT a deep-rooted belief in the power of the witch still lingers in the
remote districts of Cornwall, cannot be denied. A gentleman, who has for
many years been actively engaged in a public capacity, gives me, in
reply to some questions which I put to him relative to a witch or
conjurer, much information, which is embodied in this section.

A "cunning man" was long resident in Bodmin, to whom the people from all
parts of the country went to be relieved of spells, under the influence
of which either themselves or their cattle were supposed to be
suffering. Thomas --, who resided at Nanstallan, not far from the town
of Bodmin, was waylaid, robbed, and well thrashed on his way home from
market. This act, which was accompanied by some appearance of brutality,
was generally referred to one of the dupes of his cunning. Howbeit,
Thomas-- appears to have felt that the place was getting too hot for
him, for he migrated to one of the parishes on the western side of the
Fowey river. Numerous instances are within my knowledge of the belief
which existed amongst the peasantry that this man really possessed the
power of removing the effects of witchcraft.

Thomas--took up his abode for some time with a small farmer, who had
lost some cattle. These losses were attributed to the malign influences
of some evil-disposed person; but as Thomas--failed to detect the
individual, he with the farmer made many journeys to Exeter, to consult
the "White Witch," who resided in that city. Whether the result was
satisfactory or otherwise, I have never learned. Thomas--, it must be
remembered, was only a "witch." The term is applied equally to men as to
women. I never heard any uneducated person speak of a "wizard." There
appears to be, however, some very remarkable distinctions between a male
and a female witch. The former is almost always employed to remove the
evil influences exerted by the latter. Witches, such as Thomas, had but
limited power. They could tell who had been guilty of ill-wishing, but
they were powerless to break the spell and "unbewitch" the sufferer.
This was frequently accomplished by the friends of the bewitched, who,
in concert with Thomas --, would perform certain ceremonies, many of
them of an obscene, and usually of a blasphemous character. The "White
Witch" was supposed to possess the higher power of removing the spell,
and of punishing the 'individual by whose wickedness the wrong had been
inflicted.

Jenny Harris was a reputed witch. This woman, old, poor, and, from the
world's ill-usage, rendered malicious, was often charged with the evils
which fell upon cattle, children, or, indeed, on men and women. On one
occasion, a robust and rough-handed washerwoman, who conceived that she
was under the spell of Jenny Harris, laid violent hands on the aged
crone, being resolved to "bring blood from her." The witch's arm was
scratched and gouged from the elbow to the wrist, so that a sound inch
of skin did not exist. This violent assault became the subject of
inquiry before the magistrates, who fined the washerwoman five pounds
for the assault.

My correspondent writes :-- "I was also present at a magistrates'
meeting at the Porcupine Inn, near Tywardreath, some years ago, when an
old woman from Golant was brought up for witchcraft. One farmer, who
appeared against her, stated that he had then six bullocks hanging up in
chains in his orchard, and he attributed their disease and death to the
poor old woman's influence. The case was dismissed, but it afforded a
good deal of merriment. There was a dinner at the inn after the meeting,
and some of the farmers present were disposed to ridicule the idea of
witchcraft. I said, well knowing their real views and opinions,
'Gentleman, it is all well enough to laugh, but it appears to me to be a
serious matter.' Upon which Mr , a farmer of --, said, 'You are right,
Mr--; I'II tell of two cases in which one family suffered severely,' and
he gave us the details of the cases. All the others present had a case
or two, each one within his own experience to vouch for, and the whole
afternoon was spent telling witch stories."

The extent to which this belief was carried within a comparatively
recent period, may be inferred from the fact that, on one occasion when
the visitors were assembled at the county asylum, a man residing at
Callington came with the mother of a poor imbecile patient, and sent his
card to the boardroom. This was inscribed with his name and M.A. Upon
being asked how he became a Master of Arts, he replied that he was a
"Master of Black Arts." The object of this fellow's visit was, having
persuaded the mother of his power, to propose to the visitors that they
should place the imbecile girl in his care, upon his undertaking, on
their paying him five pounds, to cure her. Of course this was not
listened to. This fellow imposed upon people to such an extent that he
was eventually tried at the sessions, under an almost forgotten Act of
Parliament, for witchcraft. The impression on the mind of my informant
is that the case broke down.
