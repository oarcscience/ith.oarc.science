REDRUTH WELL.

NO child christened in this well has ever been hanged. Saint Ruth, said
to have been called Red Ruth, because she always wore a scarlet cloak,
especially blessed, to this extent, those waters. I believe the
population in this large parish cares but little now whether their
children be baptized with this well water or any other; but, half a
century since, it was very different. Then, many a parent would insist
on seeing the water taken from the well and carried to the font in the
church.
