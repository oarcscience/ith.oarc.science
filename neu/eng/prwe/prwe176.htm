<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LORD OF PENGERSWICK AN ENCHANTER.</p>
<P>THE Lord of Pengerswick came from some Eastern clime,
bringing with him a foreign lady of great beauty. She was considered by all
an &quot;outlandish&quot; woman; and by many declared to be a &quot;Saracen.&quot; [a]<i> </i>No
one, beyond the selected servants, was ever allowed within the walls of
Pengerswick Castle; and they, it was said, were bound by magic spells. No
one dared tell of anything transacted within the walls; consequently all.
was conjecture amongst the neighbouring peasantry, miners, and fishermen.
Certain it was, they said, that Pengerswick would shut himself up for days
together in his chamber, burning strange things, which sent their strong
odours,--not only to every part of the castle,--</p>
<P>
but for miles around the country. Often at night, and especially in
stormy weather, Pengerswick was heard for hours together calling up the
spirits, by reading from his books in some unknown tongue. On those
occasions his voice would roll through the halls louder than the surging
waves which beat against the neighbouring rocks, the spirits replying like
the roar of thunder. Then would all the servants rush in fright from the
building, and remain crowded together, even in the most tempestuous night,
in one of the open courts. Fearful indeed would be the strife between the
man and the demons ; and it sometimes happened that the spirits were too
powerful for the enchanter. He was, however, constantly and carefully
watched by his wife; and whenever the strife became too serious, her harp
was heard making the softest, the sweetest music. At this the spirits fled;
and they were heard passing through the air towards the Land's-End, moaning
like the soughing of a depart&#173;ing storm. The lights would then be
extinguished in the enchanter's tower, and all would be peace. The servants
would return to their apartments with a feeling of perfect confidence. They
feared their master, but their mistress inspired them with love. Lady
Pengers&#173;wick was never seen beyond the grounds surrounding the castle. She
sat all day in lonely state and pride in her tower, the lattice-window of
her apartment being high on the seaward side. Her voice accompanying the
music of her harp was rarely heard, hut when she warbled the soft love
strains of her Eastern land. Often at early dawn the very fishes of the
neighbouring bay would raise their heads above the surface of the waters,
enchanted by the music and the voice; and it is said that the mermaids from
the Lizard, and many of the strange spirits of the waters, would come near
to Pengerswick cove, drawn by the same influence. On moonlight nights the
air has often seemed to be full of sound, and yet the lady's voice was
seldom louder than that of a warbling bird. On these occasions, men have
seen thousands of spirits gliding up and down the moonbeams, and floating
idly on the silvered waves, listening to, and sometimes softly echoing, the
words which Lady Pengerswick sang. Long did this strange pair inhabit this
lonely castle; and although the Lord of Pengerswick frequently rode abroad
on a most magnificent horse--which had the reputation of being of Satanic
origin, it was at once so docile to its master and so wild to any other
person,--yet he made no acquaintance with any of the neighbour&#173;ing gentry.
He was feared by all, and yet they respected him for many of the good deeds
performed by him. He completely enthralled the Giants of the Mount; and
before he disappeared from Cornwall,
they died, owing, it was said, to grief and want of food.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;Where the Lord of Pengerswick
came from, no one knew; he, with his lady, with two attendants, who never
spoke in any but an Eastern tongue, which was understood by none around
them, made their appearance one winter's day, mounted on beautiful horses,
evidently from Arabia or some distant land.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;They soon--having gold in abundance--got
possession of a cottage; and in a marvellously short time the castle, which
yet bears his name, was rebuilt by this lord. Many affirm that the lord by
the force of his enchantments, and the lady by the spell of her voice,
compelled the spirits of the earth and air to work for them; and that three
nights were sufficient to rear an enormous pile, of which but one tower now
remains.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;Their coming was sudden and mysterious;
their going was still more so. Years had rolled on, and the people around
were familiarised with those strange neighbours, from whom also they derived
large profits, since they paid whatsoever price was demanded for any article
which they required. One day a stranger was seen in Market-Jew, whose face
was bronzed by long exposure to an Eastern sun. No one knew him; and he
eluded the anxious inquiries of the numerous gossips, who were especially
anxious to learn something of this man, who, it was surmised by every one,
must have some connection with Pengerswick or his lady; yet no one could
assign any reason for such a supposition. Week after week passed away, and
the stranger remained in the town, giving no sign. Wonder was on every old
woman's lips, and expressed in every old man's eyes; but they had to wonder
on. One thing, it was said, had been noticed; and this seemed to confirm the
suspicions of the people. The stranger wandered out on dark nights--spent
them, it was thought on the sea-shore; and some fishermen said they had seen
him seated on the rock at the entrance of the valley of
Pengerswic'k. It was thought that the lord kept more at home than usual, and of late
no one had heard his incantation songs and sounds; neither had they heard
the harp of the lady. A very tempestuous night, singular for its gloom--
when even the ordinary light, which, on the darkest night, is evident to the
traveller in the open country, it did not exist--appears to have brought
things to their climax. There was a sudden alarm in Market-Jew, a red glare
in the eastern sky, and presently a burst of flames above the hill, and St
Michael's Mount was illuminated in a remarkable manner.
Pengerswick
Castle was on fire; the servants fled in terror; but neither the lord nor his
lady could be found. From that day to the present they were lost to all.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;The interior of the castle was entirely
destroyed; not a vestige of furniture, books, or anything belonging to the
"Enchanter" could be found. He and everything belonging to him had vanished,
and, strange to tell, from that night the bronzed stranger was never again
seen. The inhabitants of Market-Jew naturally crowded to the fire; and when
all was over they returned to their homes, speculating on the strange
occurrences of the night. Two of the oldest people always declared that,
when the flames were at the highest, they saw two men and a lady floating in
the midst of the lire, and that they ascended from amidst the falling walls,
passed through the air like lightning, and disappeared.</p>
