JAGO'S DEMON.

THE vicar of Wendron, who bore the name of Jago, appears to have had
strange intercourse with the invisible world; or, rather, the primitive
people of this district believe him to have possessed supernatural
powers. Any one visiting the parish of Wendron will be struck with many
distinguishing features in its inhabitants. It would appear as if a
strange people had settled down amidst the races already inhabiting the
spot, and that they had studiously avoided any intimate connection with
their neighbours. The dialect of the Wendron people is unlike any other
in Cornwall, and there are many customs existing amongst them which are
not found in any other part of the county. Until of late years, the
inhabitants of Wendron were quite uneducated;--. hence the readiness
with which they associate ancient superstitions with comparatively
modern individuals.

The Reverend Mr Jago was no doubt a man who impressed this people with
the powers of his knowledge. Hence we are told that no spirit walking
the earth could resist the spells laid upon him by Jago. By his
prayers--or powers--many a night wanderer has been put back into his
grave, and so confined that the poor ghost could never again get loose.
To the evil-disposed Mr Jago was a terror. All Wendron believed that
every act was visible to the parson at the moment it was done-- day or
night it mattered not. He has been known to pick a thief at once out of
a crowd, and criminal men or women could not endure the glance of his
eye. Many a person has at once confessed to guilty deeds of which they
have been suspected the moment they have been brought before Mr Jago.

We are told that he had spirits continually waiting upon him, though
invisible until he desired them to appear. The parson rode far and wide
over the moorland of his parish. He never took a groom with him; for,
the moment he alighted from his horse, he had only to strike the earth
with his whip, and up came a demon-groom to take charge of the steed.
