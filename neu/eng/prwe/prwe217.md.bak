PHANTOMS OF THE DYING.

GAY party were assembled one afternoon, in the latter days of January,
in the best parlour of a farmhouse near the Land's-End. The inhabitants
of this district were, in many respects, peculiar. Nearly all the land
was divided up between, comparatively, a few owners, and every owner
lived on and farmed his own land.

This circumstance, amongst others, led to a certain amount of style in
many of the old farmhouses of the Land's-End district; and even now, in
some of them, from which, alas! the. glory has departed, may be seen the
evidences of taste beyond that which might have been expected in so
remote a district.

The "best parlour" was frequently panelled with carved oak, and the
ceiling, often highly, though it must be admitted, heavily decorated. In
such a room, in the declining light of a January afternoon, were some
ten or a dozen farmers' daughters, all of them unmarried, and many of
them having an eye on the farmer's eldest son, a fine, young man about
twenty years of age, called Joseph.

This farmer and his wife, at the time of which we speak, had three sons
and two daughters. The eldest son was an excellent and amiable young
man, possessed of many personal attractions, and especially fond of the
society of his sisters and their friends. The next son was of a very
different stamp, and was more frequently found in the inn at Church-town
than in his father's house; the younger son was an apprentice at
Penzance. The two daughters, Mary and Honour, had coaxed their mother
into "a tea and heavy cake" party, and Joseph was especially retained,
to be, as every one said he was, "the life of the company."

In those days, when, especially in those parts, every one took dinner at
noon, and tea not much after four o'clock, the party had assembled
early.

There had been the usual preliminary gossip amongst the young people,
when they began to talk about the wreck of a fruit-ship, which had
occurred but a few days before, off the Land's-End, and it was said that
considerable quantities of oranges were washing into Nangisseil Cove.
Upon this, Joseph said he would take one of the, men from the farm, and
go down to the Cove--which was not far off--and see if they could not
find some oranges for the ladies.

The day had faded into twilight, the western sky was still bright with
the light of the setting sun, and the illuminated clouds shed a certain
portion of their splendour into the room in which the party were
assembled. The girls were divided up into groups, having their own
pretty little bits of gossip, often truly delightful from its entire
freedom and its innocence; and the mother oI Joseph was seated near the
fireplace, looking with some anxiety through the windows, from which you
commanded a view of the Atlantic Ocean. The old lady was restless;
sometimes she had to whisper something to Mary, and then some other
thing to Honour. Her anxiety, at length, was expressed in her wondering
where Joseph could be tarrying so long. All the young ladies sought to
ease her mind by saying that there were no doubt so many
orange-gatherers in the Cove, that Joseph and the man could not get so
much fruit as he desired.

Joseph was the favourite son of 'his mother, and her anxiety evidently
increased. Eventually, starting from her 'chair, the old lady exclaimed,
"Oh, here he is; now I 'll see about the tea."

With a pleased smile on her face, she left the room, to return, however,
to it in deeper sorrow.

The mother expected to meet her son at the door--he came not. Thinking
that he might possibly have beep wetted by the sea, and that he had gone
round the house to another door leading directly into the kitchen, for
the purpose of drying himself or of changing his boots, she went into
the dairy to fetch the basin of clotted cream,--which had been "taken
up" with unusual care,--to see if the junket was properly set, and to
spread the flaky cream thickly upon its surface.

Strange,--as the old lady subsequently related,--all the pans of milk
were agitated--" the milk rising up and down like the waves of the sea."

The anxious mother returned to the parlour with her basin of cream, but
with an indescribable feeling of an unknown terror. She commanded
herself, and, in her usual quiet way, asked if Joseph had been in. When
they answered her "No," she sighed heavily, and sank senseless into a
chair.

Neither Joseph nor the servant ever returned alive. They were seen
standing together upon a rock, stooping to gather oranges as they came
with each wave up to their feet, when one of the heavy swells--the
lingering undulations of a tempest, so well known on this coast--came
sweeping onward, and carried them both away in its- cave of waters, as
the wave curved to engulf them.

The undertow of the tidal current was so strong that, though powerful
men and good swimmers, they were carried at once beyond all human aid,
and speedily perished.

The house of joy became a house of mourning, and sadness rested on it
for years. Day after day passed by, and, although a constant watch was
kept along the coast, it was not until the fated ninth day that the
bodies were discovered, and they were then found in a sadly mutilated
state.

Often after long years, and when the consolations derivable from pure
religious feeling had brought that tranquillity upon the mind of this
loving mother,--which so much resembles the poetical repose of an
autumnal evening,--has she repeated to me the sad tale.

Again and again have I heard her declare that she saw Joseph, her son,
as distinctly as ever she saw him in her life, and that, as he passed
the parlour windows, he looked in upon her and smiled.

This is not given as a superstition belonging in any peculiar way to
Cornwall. In every part of the British Isles it exists; but I have never
met with any people who so firmly believed in the appearance of the
phantoms of the dying to those upon whom the last thoughts are centred,
as the Cornish did.

Another case is within my knowledge.

A lady, the wife of an officer in the navy, had been with her husband's
sister, on a summer evening, to church. The husband was in the
Mediterranean, and there was no reason to expect his return for many
months.

These two ladies returned home, and the wife, ascending the; stairs
before her sister-in, law, went into the drawing-room--her intention
being to close the windows, which, as the weather had been warm and
fine, had been thrown open.

She had proceeded about half way across the room, when she shrieked, ran
back, and fell into her sister-in-law's arms. Upon recovery, she stated
that a figure, like that of her husband, enveloped in a mist, appeared
to her to fill one of the windows.

By her friends, the wife's fancies were laughed at; and, if not
forgotten, the circumstance was no longer spoken of.

Month after month glided by, without intelligence of the ship to which
that officer belonged. At length the Government became anxious, and
searching inquiries were made. Some time still elapsed, but eventually
it was ascertained that this sloop of war had perished in a white
squall, in which she became involved, near the Island of Mitylene, in
the Grecian Archipelago, on the Sunday evening when the widow fancied
she saw her husband.
