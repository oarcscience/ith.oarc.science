<P ALIGN="CENTER">BURNING ANIMALS ALIVE.</p>
<P>HERE can be no doubt but that a belief prevailed, until a
very recent period, amongst the small farmers in the districts' remote from
towns, in Cornwall, that a living sacrifice appeased the wrath of God. This
sacrifice must be by fire; and I have heard it argued that the Bible gave them
warranty for this belief.</p>
<P>The accompanying notes, from Hone's &quot;Every-Day Book,&quot; and
from Drew and Hitchen's &quot;Cornwall,&quot; prove the prevalence--at least at the
commencement of this century--of this idea. I have lately been informed that
within the last few years a calf has been thus sacrificed by a farmer, in a
district where churches, chapels, and schools abound.</p>
<P>The burning of blood, drawn from a deceased animal, has
been a very common mode of appeasing the spirits of disease.</p>
<P>&quot;There are too many obvious traces of the fact to doubt its
truth, that the making of bonfires, and the leaping through them, are vestiges
of the ancient worship of the heathen god Bal; and therefore it is, with
propriety, that the editor of &quot;Time's Telescope&quot; adduces a recent occurrence
from Drew and Hitchin's &quot;History of Cornwall,&quot; as a probable remnant of pagan
superstition in that country. He presumes that the vulgar notion which gave
rise to it was derived from the Druidical sacrifice of beasts: 'An ignorant
old farmer in Cornwall, having met with some severe losses in his cattle about
the year 1800, was much afflicted with his misfortunes. To stop the growing
evil, he applied-to the farriers in his neighbourhood, but unfortunately he
applied in vain. The malady still continuing, and all remedies failing, he
thought it necessary to have recourse to some extraordinary measure.
Accordingly, on consulting with some of his neighbours, equally ignorant with
himself, and evidently not less barbarous, they recalled to their
recollections a tale, which tradition had handed down from remote antiquity,
that the calamity would not cease until he had actually burned alive the
finest calf which lie had upon his farm; but that, when this sacrifice was
made, the murrain would afflict his cattle no more. The old farmer, influenced
by this counsel, resolved immediately on reducing it to practice; that, by
making the detestable experiment, he might secure an advantage which the
whisperers of tradition and the advice of his neighbours had conspired to
assure him would follow. He accordingly called several of his friends together
on an appointed day, and having lighted a large fire, brought forth his best
calf, and without ceremony or remorse, pushed it into the flames. The innocent
victim, on feeling the intolerable heat, endeavoured to escape; but this was
in vain. The barbarians that surrounded the fire were armed with pitchforks,
or pikes, as in Cornwall they are generally called; and, as the burning victim
endeavoured to escape from death, with these instruments of cruelty the
wretches pushed back the tortured animal into the flames. In this state,
amidst the wounds of pitchforks, the shouts of unfeeling ignorance and
cruelty, and the corrosion of flames, the dying victim poured out its expiring
groan, and was consumed to ashes. It is scarcely possible to reflect on this
instance of superstitious barbarity without tracing a kind of resemblance
between it and the ancient sacrifices of the Druids. Tins calf was sacrificed
to fortune, or good luck, to avert impending calamity, and to insure future
prosperity, and was selected by the farmer as the finest among his herd.'
Every intelligent native of Cornwall will perceive that this extract from the
history of his county is here made for the purpose of shaming the brutally
ignorant, if it be possible, into humanity.' [a]</p>
<P>The remarks in Drew and Hitchin are as follows</p>
<P>&quot;There is a tradition in Cornwall, which has been handed
down from remote antiquity, that farmers may prevent any calamity by burning
alive the finest calf they possess. This was so fully believed, tbat even as
late as the year I800, an ignorant old farmer, having met with some severe
losses in his cattle, determined on being advised by some neighbours, not less
barbarous than himself, to try this remedy. He accordingly, on an appointed
day, called his friends together, lighted a large fire, brought forth his best
calf, and without ceremony or remorse, pushed it into the flames.&quot;</p>
<P>[While correcting these sheets, I am informed of two recent
instances of this superstition. One of them was the sacrifice of a calf by a
farmer near Portreath, for the purpose of removing a disease which had long
followed his horses and his cows. The other was the burning of a living lamb,
to save, as the farmer said, &quot;his flock from spells which had been cast on
'em.&quot;]</p>
