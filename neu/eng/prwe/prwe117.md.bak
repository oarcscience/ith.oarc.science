A FLYING SPIRIT.

ABOUT the year 1761 a pinnacle was thrown down, by lightning, from the
tower of the church at Ludgvan. The effect was then universally imputed
to the vengeance of a perturbed spirit, exorcised from Treassow, and
passing eastward, towards the usual place of banishment --THE RED SEA.

The following story is given as a remarkable example of the manner in
which very recent events become connected with exceedingly old
superstitious ideas. The tales of Tregeagle have shown us how the name
of a man who lived about two centuries since is made to do duty as a
demon belonging to the pagan times. In this story we have the name of a
woman who lived about the commencement of the present century,
associated with a legend belonging to the earliest ages.
