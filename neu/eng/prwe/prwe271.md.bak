THE HORNS ON THE CHURCH TOWER.

 WHEN the masons were building the tower of Towednack Church, the devil
came every night and carried off the pinnacles and battlements.

Again and again this work was renewed during the day, and as often was
it removed during the night, until at length the builders gave up the
work in despair, feeling that it was of no use to contend with the evil
one.

Thus it is that Towednack Church stands lonely, with its squat and
odd-looking tower, a mark of the power of evil to the present day.
Associated with this tower is a proverb "There are no cuckolds in
Towednack, because there are no horns on the church tower."
