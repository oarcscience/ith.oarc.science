<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PIXIES OF DARTMOOR.</p>
<P><br>
THERE is a celebrated piskie haunt at Costellas in Cornwall (says Mrs Bray),
where they have been seen sitting in a ring--the men smoking after .the most
approved fashion of the Dutch burgomaster, and the women spinning, perhaps in
emulation of the frugal vrow.</p>
<P>I never heard of this place. Like the rest of the &quot;good
people,&quot; piskies are fond of music, and the sound of their &quot;harp and pipe and
symphony,&quot; is occasionally heard at nightfall. It is said that a man once
passing one of the piskie rings, and hearing them dancing and singing within
it, threw a large stone into the midst of the circle, when the music at once
ceased and a dreadful shriek arose.</p>
<P>The appearance of <i>the pixies</i> of Dartmoor is said to
resemble that of a bale or bundle of rags. In this shape they decoy children
to their unreal pleasure. A woman, on the northern borders of the moor, was
returning home late on a dark evening, accompanied by two children, and
carrying a third in her arms, when, on arriving at her own door, she found one
missing. Her neighbours, with lanthorns, immediately set out in quest of the
lost child; whom they found sitting under a large oak-tree, well known to be a
favourite haunt of the pixies. He declared that he had been led away by two
large bundles of rags, which had remained with him until the lights appeared,
when they immediately vanished. [a]</p>
<P>The pixies of Dartmoor, notwithstanding their darker
character, aided occasionally in household work. A washer-woman was one
morning greatly surprised, on coming down-stairs, to find all her clothes
neatly washed and folded. She watched the next evening, and observed a pixie
in the act of performing this kind office for her: but she was ragged and mean
in appearance, and Betty's gratitude was sufficiently great to- induce her to
prepare a yellow petticoat and a red cap for the obliging pixie.</p>
<P>[a] For additional information respecting the pixies of the
banks of the Tamar and the Tavy, the reader is referred to Mrs Bray's
&quot;Traditions, Legends, Superstitious, and Sketches of Devonshire.&quot;</p>
