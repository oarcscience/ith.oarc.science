ROMANCES OF FIRE WORSHIP.

"Safely hid  
Beneath the purple pall of sacrifice  
Did sleep our holy fire, nor saw the air,  
Till to that pass we came, where whilom Brute  
Planted his five hoar altars. To our rites  
Then swift we hasted, and in one short moment  
The rocky piles were clothed with livid flame."  
Caractacus- Wm. MASON, M.A.

An angel who at last in sight  
Of both my parents all in flames ascended  
From off the altar, where an offering burn'd,  
As in a fiery column charioting  
His god-like presence."  
-- Samson Agonistes  
-- MILTON.

IT would not be profitable to pursue the inquiry into the value of the
numerous hypotheses which have been from time to time raised in support
of the assertion that a system of Fire Worship prevailed amongst the
Britons of old Cornwall.

There can be no doubt but that the writings of Borlase, and other
earnest thinkers of his class, have done much to perpetuate the belief
in the existence of a Druidical priesthood in Cornwall, who had their
altars on the hills,--who made the huge piles of granite rocks the
instruments of their worship,--and who availed themselves of the hollows
formed in those rocks by nature, to procure the unpolluted waters from
heaven, with which to wash away sins.

The antiquary has too frequently placed himself in the unfortunate
position of Jonathan Oldbuck amidst the ancient fortifications at the
Kaim of Kinprunes, when he was so rudely checked in his theory by Edie
Ochiltree, who would insist on it that he did "mind the biggin' o' 't."
But the modern historian and philosopher has gone as far wrong in the
contrary direction. The antiquaries formerly insisted that all the
natural basins formed in the granite rocks were of Druidic origin, and
all the Logan stones the result of Druid labours. The geologists and
historians now declare them, one and all, to be the result of
disintegration, produced by ordinary atmospheric causes. Both are, I
persume to think, wrong. I am quite satisfied that I can point to
rock-basins upon which the hands of man have been busy, and to Logan
stones in which he has, for his own purposes, aided nature.

In the Sacrificing Rock on Carn Brae are a series of hollows so deeply
cut, and so entirely unlike anything seen on any of the other rocks on
that remarkable hill, although ordinary rock-basins are numerous, that I
am disposed to believe in the tradition which gives it its name. On the
Main or Men Rock in Constantine, I see, in like manner, evidences of the
works of man, side by side with those of nature. The disintegration
produced by the accumulation of water, at first in small quantities in a
little hollow on the face of a rock, is a curious process. The first
action is the separation of a few particles, or small crystals, of
quartz or mica. These repose beneath the small deposit of water, until,
by the beating of the rains and the action of the winds, they are made
to serve as grinding materials, and carry on the work of weathering. The
basins thus formed have a regular curvature, which does not belong to
those deeper basins to which I have referred. The question, however,
before us is, Have we any evidences, traditional or otherwise, which go
to support the belief that the Phoenicians, or any other people,
introduced the worship of fire into this country?

The influences of education, and the zeal with which religious teachers
have penetrated into the remotest districts and taught the truth, have
banished nearly every relic of this ancient idolatry. But still amidst
the dead ashes a faint spark occasionally appears, to tell us that at
one time our forefathers did use the rocks as altars, on which they
kindled sacrificial fires; and that they had their periods of solemn
feast, when every hill blazed with the emblem of life and dissolution. A
few examples of these pale sparks will not be without value.
