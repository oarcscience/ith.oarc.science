ON THE BIRTHS OF CHILDREN.

 "SUNDAY'S child is full of grace,  
Monday's child is full in the face,  
Tuesday's child is solemn and sad,  
Wednesday's child is merry and glad,  
Thursday's child is inclined to thieving,  
Friday's child is free in giving,  
Saturday's child works hard for his living."
