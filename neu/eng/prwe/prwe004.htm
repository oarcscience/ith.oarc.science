<P><br>
WHO can dare question such an authority as John Milton? In his &quot;History of
Britain, that part especially now called England. From the first Traditional
beginning continued to the Norman Conquest. Collected out of the antientest
and best authors thereof.&quot; he gives us the story of Brutus and of Corineus,
&quot;who with the battele Ax which he was wont to manage against the <i>Tyrrhen
Giants</i>, is said to have done marvells.&quot; With the adventures of these
heroes in <i>Africa</i> and in <i>Aquitania</i> we have little concern. They
suffer severe defeats; and then &quot;Brutus, finding now his powers much lessn'd,
and this not yet the place foretold him, leaves Aquitain, and with an easy
course arriving at Totness in <i>Dev'nshire</i>, quickly perceivs heer to be
the promis'd end of his labours.&quot; The following matters interest us more
closely: [a]--</p>
<P>&quot;The Iland, not yet <i>Britain</i>, but <i>Albion</i>, was
in a manner desert and inhospitable, kept only by a remnant of <i>Giants</i>,
whose excessive Force and Tyrannie had consumed the rest. Them Brutus
destroies, and to his people divides the land, which, with some reference to
his own name, he thenceforth calls <i>Britain</i>. To <i>Corincus</i>, <i>
Cornwall</i>, as now we call it, fell by lot; the rather by him lik't, for
that the hugest Giants in Rocks and Caves were said to lurk still there; which
kind of Monsters to deal with was his old exercise.</p>
<P>&quot;And heer, with leave bespok'n to recite a grand fable,
though dignify'd by our best Poets: While Brutus, on a certain Festival day,
solemnly kept on that shoar where he first landed (Totness), was with the
People in great jollity and mirth, a crew of these savages, breaking in upon
them, began on the sudden another sort of Game than at such a meeting was
expected. But at length by many hands overcome, <i>Goemagog</i>, the hugest,
in hight twelve cubits, is reserved alive; that with him Corineus, who desired
nothing more, might try his strength, whom in a Wrestle the Giant catching
aloft, with a terrible bugg broke three of his Ribs: Nevertheless Corineus,
enraged, heaving him up by main force, and on his shoulders bearing him to the
next high rock, threw him hedlong all shatter'd into the sea, and left his
name on the cliff, called ever since <i>Langoemagog</i>, which is to say, the
Giant's Leap.&quot; The same story has been somewhat differently told, although
there is but little variation in the main incidents. When Brutus and Corineus,
with their Trojan hosts, landed at Plymouth, these chiefs wisely sent parties
into the interior to explore the country, and to learn something of the
people. At the end of the first day, all the soldiers who had been sent out as
exploring parties, returned in great terror, pursued by several terrific
giants. Brutus and Corineus were not, however, to be terrified by the immense
size of their enemies, nor by the horrid noises which they made, hoping to
strike terror into the armed hosts. These chieftains rallied their hosts and
marched to meet the giants, hurling their spears and flinging their darts
against their huge bodies. The assault was so unexpected that the giants gave
way, and eventually fled to the hills of Dartmoor. Gogmagog, the captain of
the giants, who was sadly wounded in the leg, and, unable to proceed, hid 
himself in a bog; but there, by the light of the moon, he was found by the
Trojan soldiers, bound with strong cords, and carried back to the Hoe at
Plymouth, where the camp was. Gogmagog was treated nobly by his victors, and
his wounds were speedily healed. Brutus desired to make terms with the giants;
and it was at length proposed by Gogmagog to try a fall with the strongest in
the host, and that whoever came off the conqueror should be proclaimed king of
Cornwall, and hold possession of all the western land. Corineus at once
accepted the challenge of the monster. Notwithstanding, the giant,</p>
<P>&quot;Though bent with woes, <br>
Full eighteen feet in height he rose;<br>
His hair; exposed to sun and wind, <br>
Like wither'd heath, his head entwined,&quot;</p>
<P>and that Corineus was but little above the ordinary size of
man, the Trojan chief felt sure of a victory. The day for the wrestling was
fixed. The huge Gogmagog was allowed to send for the giants, and they
assembled on one side of a cleared space on Plymouth Hoe, while the Trojan
soldiers occupied the other. All arms were thrown aside; and fronting each
other, naked to the waist, stood the most lordly of the giants, and the most
noble of men. The conflict was long, and it appeared for sometime doubt ful.
Brute strength was exerted on one side, and trained skill on the other. At
length Corineus succeeded in seizing Gogmagog by the girdle, and by
regularly-repeated impulses he made the monster undulate like a tree shaken by
a winter storm, until at length, gathering all his strength into one effort,
the giant was forced to his back on the ground, the earth shaking with his
weight, and the air echoing with the thunder of his mighty groan, as the
breath was forced from his body by the terrible momentum of his fall. There
lay the giant, and there were all the other giants, appalled at the power
which they could not understand, but which convinced them that there was
something superior to mere animal strength. Corineus breathed for a minute,
then he rushed upon his prostrate foe, and seizing him by the legs, he dragged
him to the edge of the cliff; and precipitated him into the sea. The giant
fell on the rocks below, and his body was broken into fragments by the fall;
while the</p>
<P>&quot;Fretted flood<br>
Roll'd frothy waves of purple blood.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Gogmagog's. Leap&quot; has been preserved near the spot which
now presents a fortress to the foes of Britain; and there are those &quot;who say
that, at the last digging on the Haw for the foundation of the citadel of
Plymouth, the great jaws and teeth therein found were those of Gogmagog.&quot; [b]</p>
