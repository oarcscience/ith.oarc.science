THE ARMED KNIGHT.

  
"AT low water there is to be seen, off the Land's End, towards the
Scilly Island (probably so called from the abundance of eel or conger
fishes caught there, which are called sillys, or lillis), for a mile or
more, a dangerous strag of ragged rocks, amongst which the Atlantic Sea
and the waves of St George's and the British Channel meeting, make a
dreadful bellowing and rumbling noise at half-ebb and half-flood, which
let seamen take notice of to avoid them.

"Of old, there was one of those rocks more notable than the rest, which
tradition saith was ninety feet above the flux and reflux of the sea,
with an iron spire at the top thereof, which was overturned or thrown
down in a violent storm, 1647, and the rock was broken in three pieces.
This iron spire, as the additions to Camden's "Britannia" inform us, was
thought to have been erected by the Romans, or set up as a trophy there
by King Athelstan, when he first conquered the Scilly Islands (which was
in those parts); but it is not very probable such a piece of iron, in
this salt sea and air, without being consumed by rust, could endure so
long a time. However, it is or was, certain I am it commonly was called
in Cornish, An Marogeth Arvowed, *i.e*., the Armed Knight; for what
reason I know not, except erected by or in memory of some armed knight;
as also Carne-an-peul, *i.e*., the spile, spire, or javelin rock. Again,
remember silly lilly, is in Cornish and Armoric language a conger fish
or fishes, from whence Scilly Islands is probably denominated, as
elsewhere noted." \[a\] Mr Blight says this rock is also called *Guela*,
or *Guelaz*,--the "rock easily seen."
