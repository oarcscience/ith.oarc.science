TREBIGGAN THE GIANT \[a\]

  
TREBEGEAN is the name of a village near the Land's End. This name, as we
have already stated, signifies the town of the giant's grave. The
giant's existence was confirmed by the discovery of a vault and some
large bones in it, on this spot. \[b\]

Trebiggan divides with Tregeagle the honourable immortality of being
employed to frighten children into virtue. Often have I heard the unruly
urchins of this neighbourhood threatened with Trebiggan. They are told
that Trebiggan was a vast man, with arms so long that he could take men
out of the ships passing by the Land's End, and place them on the
Longships; hut that sometimes he would, having had his fun with them,
good-humouredly place them on board their ships or boats again. He is
said to have dined every day on little children, who were generally
fried on a large flat rock which stood at. a little distance from his
cave.
