<P ALIGN="CENTER">HOW TO EAT PILCHARDS.</p>
<P>IT is unlucky to commence eating pilchards, or, indeed, any
kind I of fish, from the head downwards. I have often heard persons rebuked
for committing such a grievous sin, which is &quot;sure to turn the heads of the
fish away from the coasts.&quot;</p>
<P>The legitimate process--mark this, all fish-eaters--is <i>
to eat the fish from the tail towards the head. </i>This brings the fish to
our shores, and secures good luck to the fishermen.</p>
