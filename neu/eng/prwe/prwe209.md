THE HOOPER, OR THE HOOTER, OF SENNEN COVE.

THIS was supposed to be a spirit which took the form of a band of misty
vapour, stretching across the bay, so opaque that nothing could be seen
through it. It was regarded as a kindly interposition of some
ministering spirit, to warn the fishermen against venturing to sea. This
appearance was always followed, and often suddenly, by a severe storm.
It is seldom or never seen now. One profane old fisherman would not be
warned by the bank of fog. The weather was fine on the shore, and the

waves fell tranquilly on the sands; and this aged sinner, declaring he
would not be made a fool of, persuaded some young men to join him. They
manned a boat, and the aged leader, having with him a threshing-flail,
blasphemously declared that he would drive. the spirit away; and he
vigorously beat the fog with the "threshel"--so the flail is called.

The boat passed through the fog and went to sea. A severe storm came on.
No one ever saw the boat or the men again; and since that time the
Hooper has been rarely seen.
