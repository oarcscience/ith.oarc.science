ST CUTHBERT'S OR CUBERT'S WELL.

HAL thus describes this famous place *:--"* In this parish is that
famous and well-known spring of water called Holy-well (so named, the
inhabitants say, for that the virtues of this water was first discovered
on All-hallows day). The same stands in a dark cavern of the sea-cliff
rocks, beneath full sea-mark on spring tides, from the top of which
cavern falls down or distils continually drops of water from the white,
blue, red, and green veins of those rocks. And accordingly, in the place
where those drops of water fall, it swells to a lump of considerable
bigness, and there petrifies to the hardness of ice, glass, or
freestone, of the several colours aforesaid, according to the nature of
those veins in the rock from whence it proceeds, and is of a hard,
brittle nature, apt to break like glass.

"The virtues of this water are very great. It is incredible what numbers
in summer season frequent this place and waters from counties far
distant." \[a\]

\[a\] Gilbert, vol. i. p. 291
