THE DEVIL'S COlTS, &c.

  
IN St Columb Major, not far from the ruins of what is generally
considered to be a British fortification, Castele-an-Dinas, stands a
tumulus known as the Devil's Coit. It is curious to find one tradition
directly contradicting another. We are told, on the one hand, that--

The devil never came into Cornwall.

Because, when he crossed the Tamar, and made Torpoint for a brief space
his resting-place, he could not but observe that everything, vegetable
or animal, was put by the Cornish people into a pie.

He saw and heard of fishy pie, star-gazy pie, conger pie, and indeed
pies of all the fishes in the sea. Of parsley pie, and herby pie, of
lamy pie, and piggy pie, and pies without number. Therefore, fearing
they might take a fancy to a "devily pie," he took himself back again
into Devonshire.

On the other hand we find, amidst the rocks of the shore and the hills,
numerous devil's coits, plenty of devil's footsteps, with devil's
bellows, devil's frying-pans, devil's ovens, and devil's caves in
abundance. Of course, on Dartmoor, since the devil remained in
Devonshire, we might expect to find such evidences of his presence. The
devil's frying-pan at Mistor is well known, and nearly every granite Tor
preserves some impression of this melancholy, wandering wicked one.
