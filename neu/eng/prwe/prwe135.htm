ST NEOT, THE PIGMY.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;WHENCE came the saint, or hermit, who has
given his name to two churches in England, is not known.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;Tradition, however, informs us that he was
remarkably small in stature, though exquisitely formed. He could not,
according to all accounts, have been more than fifteen inches high. Yet,
though so diminutive a man, he possessed a soul which was, giant-like in the
power of his faith. The Church of St Neot, which has been built on the ancient site of the hermit's cell, is
situated in a secluded valley, watered by a branch of the river Fowey. The
surrounding country is, even now, but very partially cultivated, and it must
have been, a few centuries since, a desert waste; but the valley is, and no
doubt ever has been, beautifully wooded. Not far from the church is the holy
well, in which the pious anchorjte would stand immersed to his neck, whilst he
repeated the whole Book of Psalms. Great was the reward for such an exercise
of devotion and faith. Out of numerous miracles we select only a few, which
have some especial character about them.</p>
