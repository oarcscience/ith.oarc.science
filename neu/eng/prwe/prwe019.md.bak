THE GIANT BOLSTER.

  
HIS mighty man held especial possession of the hill formerly known as
*Carne Bury-anacht* or *Bury-anack*, \[a\] "the sparstone grave,"
sometimes called *St Agnes' Ball* and *St Agnes' Pestis*, but which is
now named, from the use made of the hill during the long war, St Agnes'
Beacon. He has left his name to a very interesting, and undoubtedly most
ancient earthwork, which still exists at the base of the hill, and
evidently extended from Trevaunance Porth to Chapel Porth, enclosing the
most important tin district in St Agnes. This is constantly called "The
Bolster."

Bolster must have been of enormous size: since it is stated that he
could stand with one foot on St Agnes' Beacon and the other on Carn
Brea; these hills being distant, as the bird flies, six miles, \[b\] his
immensity will be clear to all. In proof of this, there still exists, in
the valley running upwards from Chapel Porth, a stone in which may yet
be seen the impression of the giant's fingers. On one occasion, Bolster,
when enjoying his usual stride from the Beacon to Carn Brea, felt
thirsty, and stooped to drink out of the well at Chapel Porth, resting,
while he did so, on the above-mentioned stone. We hear but little of the
wives of our giants; but Bolster had a wife, who was made to labour hard
by her tyrannical husband. On the top of St Agnes' Beacon there yet
exist the evidences of the useless labours to which this unfortunate
giantess was doomed, in grouped masses of small stones. These, it is
said, have all been gathered from an estate at the foot of the hill,
immediately adjoining the village of St Agnes. This farm is to the
present day remarkable for its freedom from stones, though situated
amidst several others, which, like most lands reclaimed from the moors
of this district, have stones in abundance mixed with the soil. Whenever
Bolster was angry with his wife, he compelled her to pick stones, and to
carry them in her apron to the top of the hill. There is some confusion
in the history of this giant, and of the blessed St Agnes to whom the
church is dedicated. They are supposed to have lived at the same time,
which, according to our views, is scarcely probable, believing, as we
do, that no giants existed long after their defeat at Plymouth by Brutus
and Corineus. There may have been an earlier saint of the same name; or
may not Saint Enns or Anns, the popular name of this parish, indicate
some other lady?

Be this as it may, the giant Bolster became deeply in love with St
Agnes, who is reputed to have been singularly beautiful, and a pattern
woman of virtue. The giant allowed the lady no repose. He followed her
incessantly, proclaiming his love, and filling the air with the tempests
of his sighs and groans. St Agnes lectured Bolster in vain on the
impropriety of his conduct, he being already a married man. This availed
not; her prayers to him to relieve her from his importunities were also
in vain. The persecuted lady, finding there was no release for her,
while this monster existed, resolved to be rid of him at any cost, and
eventually succeeded by the following stratagem:-- Agnes appeared at
length to be persuaded of the intensity of the giant's love, but she
told him she required yet one small proof more. There exists at Chapel
Porth a hole in the cliff at the termination of the valley. If Bolster
would fill this hole with his blood the lady would no longer look coldly
on him. This huge bestrider-of-the-hills thought that it was an easy
thing which was required of him, and felt that he could fill many such
holes and be none the weaker for the loss of blood. Consequently,
stretching his great arm across the hole, he plunged a knife into a
vein, and a torrent of gore issued forth. Roaring and seething the blood
fell to the bottom, and the giant expected in a few minutes to see the
test of his devotion made evident, in the filling of the hole. It
required much more blood than Bolster had supposed; still it must in a
short time be filled, so he bled on. Hour after hour the blood flowed
from the vein, yet the hole was not filled. Eventually the giant fainted
from exhaustion. The strength of life within his mighty frame enabled
him to rally, yet he had no power to lift himself from the ground, and
he was unable to stanch the wound which he had made. Thus it was, that
after many throes, the giant Bolster died !

The cunning saint, in proposing this task to Bolster, was well aware
that the hole opened at the bottom into the sea, and that as rapidly as
the blood flowed into the hole it ran from it, and did

"The multitudinous seas incarnadine,  
Making the green one red."

Thus the lady got rid of her hated lover; Mrs Bolster was released, and
the district freed from the presence of a tyrant. The hole at Chapel
Porth still retains the evidences of the truth of this tradition, in the
red stain which marks the track down which flowed the giant's blood.

There is another tradition, in some respects resembling this one,
respecting a giant who dwelt at Goran, on the south Coast.

\[a\] *Bury*, Saxon for grave. This does not appear to be Cornish, which
is *bedh*; Welsh, *bedd*.
