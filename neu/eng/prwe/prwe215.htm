<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE DEATH FETCH OF WILLIAM RUFUS.</p>
<P>ROBERT, Earl of Moreton, in Normandy,--who always
carried the standard of St Michael before him in battle,--was made Earl of
Cornwall by William the Conqueror. He was remarkable for his valour and for
his virtue, for the exercise of his power, and his benevolence to the
priests. This was the Earl of Cornwall who gave the Mount in Cornwall to the
monks of Mont St Michel in Normandy. He seized upon the priory of St Petroc
at Bodmin, and converted all the lands to his own use.</p>
<P>This Earl of Cornwall was an especial friend of William
Rufus. It happened that Robert, the earl, was hunting in the extensive woods
around Bodmin--of which some remains are still to be found in the Glyn
Valley. The chase had been a severe one; a fine old red deer had baffled the
huntsmen, and they were dispersed through the intricacies of the forest, the
Earl of Cornwall being left alone. He advanced beyond the shades of the
woods on to the moors above them, and he was surprised to see a very large
black goat advancing over the plain. As it approached him, which it did
rapidly, he saw that it bore on its back &quot;King Rufus,&quot; all black and naked,
and wounded through in the midst of his breast. Robert adjured the goat, in
the name of the Holy Trinity, to tell what it was he carried so strangely.
He answered, &quot;I am carrying your king to judgment; yea, that tyrant William
Rufus, for I am an evil spirit, and the revenger of his malice which he bore
to the Church of God. It was I that did cause this slaughter; the
protomartyr of England, St Albyn, commanding me so to do, who complained to
God of him, for his grievous oppression in this Isle of Britain, which he
first hallowed.&quot; Having so spoken, the spectre vanished. Robert, the earl,
related the circumstance to his followers, and they shortly after learned
that at that very hour William Rufus had been slain in the New Forest by the
arrow of Walter Tirell.</p>
