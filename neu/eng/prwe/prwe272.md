TEA-STALKS AND SMUT

 STEMS of tea floating in that beverage indicate strangers. Flakes of
smut hanging loose to the fire-bars do the same thing.

The time of the stranger's arrival may be known by placing the stem on
the back of one hand and smacking it with the other:\` the number of
blows given before it is removed indicates the number of days before his
arrival.

The flake of carbon is blown upon, and according as it is removed by the
first, second, or third blow, so is the time at the end of which the
visitor may be expected.
