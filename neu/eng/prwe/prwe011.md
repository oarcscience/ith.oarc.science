THE GIANT OF NANCLEDRY.\[a\]

  
IN Nancledry Bottoms, about a mile from the famous hill Castle-an-Dinas,
there stood at one time a thatched house near the brook which runs
murmuring down the valley. Rather more than thirty years since, some
mouldering "clob" (mud) walls, indicating the existence at one time of a
large dwelling, were pointed to as the former residence of a terrible
giant. He appears to have led a solitary life, and to have lived
principally on little children, whom he is said to have swallowed whole.
His strength was indicated by several huge masses of granite which were
scattered around the Bottoms, and in the neighbouring fields. These were
carried by him in his pockets, to defend himself from the giants of
Trecrobben, with whom he appears to have been on unfriendly terms. This
giant is noteworthy as the only one recorded who lived in a house.
