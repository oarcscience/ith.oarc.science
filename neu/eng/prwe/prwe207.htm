THE VOICE FROM THE SEA.</p>
<P>A
FISHERMAN or a pilot was walking one night on the sands at Porth-Towan,
when all was still save the monotonous fall of the light waves upon the
sand.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;He distinctly heard a voice from
the sea exclaiming,--</p>
<P>
&nbsp;"The hour is come, but not the
man."</p>
<P>
&nbsp;This was repeated three times, when a black figure, like that of a man,
appeared on the top of the hill. It paused for a moment, then rushed
impetuously down the steep incline, over the sands, and was lost in the sea.
In different forms this story is told
all around the Cornish coast.</p>
