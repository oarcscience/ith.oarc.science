THE DISCOVERY OF TIN.

St Piran, or St Perran, leading his lonely life on the plains which now
bear his name, devoted himself to the study of the objects which
presented themselves to his notice. The good saint decorated the altar
in his church with the choicest flowers, and his cell was adorned with
the crystals which he could collect from the neighbouring rocks. In his
wanderings on the sea-shore, St Perran could not but observe the
numerous mineral, veins running through the slate-rocks forming the
beautiful cliffs on this coast. Examples of every kind he collected; and
on one occasion, when preparing his humble meal, a heavy black stone was
employed to form a pan of the fireplace. The fire was more intense than
usual, and a stream of beautiful white metal flowed out of the fire.
Great was the joy of the saint; he perceived that God, in His goodness,
had discovered to him something which would be useful to man. St Perran
communicated his discovery to St Chiwidden. \[a\] They examined the
shores together, and Chiwidden, who was learned in the learning of the
East, soon devised a process for producing this metal in large
quantities. The two saints called the Cornish men together. They told
them of their treasures, and they taught them how to dig the ore from
the earth, and how, by the agency of fire, to obtain the metal. Great
was the joy in Cornwall, and many days of feasting followed the
announcement. Mead and metheglin, with other drinks, flowed in
abundance; and vile rumour says the saints and their people were
rendered equally unstable thereby. "Drunk as a Perraner," has certainly
passed into a proverb from that day.

The riot of joy at length came to an end, and steadily, seriously, the
tribes of

Perran and St Agnes set to work. They soon accumulated a vast quantity
of this precious metal; and when they carried it to the southern coasts,
the merchants from Gaul eagerly purchased it of them. The noise of the
discovery, even in those days, rapidly extended itself; and even the
cities of Tyre learned that a metal, precious to them, was to be
obtained in a country far to the west. The Phoenician navigators were
not long in finding out the Tin Islands; and great was the alarm amidst
the Cornish Britons lest the source of their treasure should be
discovered. Then it was they intrenched the whole of St Agnes beacon;
then it was they built the numerous hill castles which have puzzled the
antiquarian; then it was that they constructed the rounds,--amongst
which the Perran Round remains as a remarkable example, -- all of them
to protect their tin ground. So resolved were the whole of the
population of the district to preserve the tin workings, that they
prevented any foreigner from landing on the mainland, and they
established tin markets on the islands on the coast. On these islands
were hoisted the standard of Cornwall, a white cross on a black ground,
which was the device of St Perran and St Chiwidden, symbolising the
black tin ore and the white metal. \[b\]
