THE MERMAID OF SEATON.

NEAR Looe,--that is, between Down Derry and Looe,--there is a little
sand-beach called "Seaton."

Tradition tells us that here once stood a goodly commercial town bearing
this name, and that when it was in its pride, Plymouth was but a small
fishing-village.

The town of Seaton is said to have been overwhelmed with sand at an
early period, the catastrophe having been brought about,--as in the case
of the filling up of Padstow harbour,--by the curse of a mermaid, who
had suffered some injury from the sailors who belonged to this port.
Beyond this I have been unable to glean any story worth preserving.
