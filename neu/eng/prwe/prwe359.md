THE HARLYN PIE

THE Peter family, who formerly lived at Harlyn, left the place, and sold
the estate to a farmer. The common report was that one of the family
manured his land with earth from the graves in Constantine churchyard.

A considerable quantity of land formerly said to belong to the poor of
the parish cannot now he found, as all the marks are gone.

The gold collar deposited in the Royal Institution at Truro, by H.R.H.,
the Duke of Cornwall, was found on the Harlyn estate.
