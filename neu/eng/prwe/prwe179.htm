<P ALIGN="CENTER">KENIDZHEK WITCH.</p>
<P>ON the tract called the &quot;Gump,&quot; near Kenidzhek, is a
beautiful well of clear water, not far from which was a miner's Cot, in
which dwelt two miners with their sister. They told her never to go to the
well after daylight; they would fetch the water for her. However, on one
Saturday night she had forgotten to get in a supply for the morrow, so she
went off to the well. Passing by a gap in a broken-down hedge (called a <i>
gurgo) </i>near the well, she saw an old woman sitting down, wrapped in a
red shawl; she asked her what she did there at that time of night, but
received no reply; she thought this rather strange, but plunged her pitcher
in the well; when she drew it up, though a perfectly sound vessel, it
contained no water; she tried again and again, and, though she saw the water
rushing in at the mouth of the pitcher, it was sure to be empty when lifted
out. She then became rather frightened; spoke again to the old woman, but
receiving no answer, hastened away, and came in great alarm to her brothers.
They told her that it was on account of this old woman they did not wish her
to go to the well at night. What she saw was the ghost of old Moll, a witch
who had been a great terror to the people in her lifetime, and had laid many
fearful spells on them. They said they saw her sitting in the gap by the
wall every night when going to bed.</p>
