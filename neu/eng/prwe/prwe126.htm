<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE ST LEVEN STONE.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;On the south side of the church, to the east of the porch,
is a rock known by the above name. It is broken in two, and the fissure is
filled in with ferns and wild flowers, while the grass grows rank around it.
On this rock St Leven often sat to rest after the fatigue of fishing; and
desiring to leave some enduring memento of himself in connection with this
his rude but favourite seat, he one day gave it a blow with his fist and
cracked it through. He prayed over the rock and uttered the following
prophecy :-- </p>
<P>&quot;When, with panniers astride, <br>
A pack-horse one can ride <br>
Through St Leven's Stone, <br>
The world will be done.&quot;</p>
<P>This stone must have been venerated for the saint's sake
when the church was built, or it would certainly have been employed for the
building. It is more than fifty years since I first made acquaintance, as a
child, with the St Leven Stone, and it may be a satisfaction' to many to
know that the progress of separation is an exceedingly slow one. I cannot
detect the slightest difference in the width of the fissure now and then. At
the present slow rate of opening, the pack-horse and panniers will not be
able to pass through the rock for many thousands of years to come. We need
not, therefore, place much reliance on those prophecies which give but a
limited duration to this planet.</p>
