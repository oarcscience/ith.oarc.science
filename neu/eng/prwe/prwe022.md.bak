ORDULF THE GIANT

  
THIS *Tavistock* Sampson is far removed from our fine old legendary
giant; yet we perceive in the stories of Ordulph precisely the same
process as that which has given immortality to Blunderbuss and others.
In the church of the monastery of Tavistock, built by Orgar in 960, and
consecrated by St Rumon, was buried Orgar, and also his son Edulf or
Ordulph, to whom, by some writers, the foundation of the abbey is
attributed Ordulph was a man of giant size, and possessing most
remarkable strength. He once appeared before the gates of the city of
Exeter in company with King Edward, and demanded admission. His demand
was not immediately complied with. He tore away the bars of the
portcullis with his hands--burst open the gates with his foot--rent the
locks and bolts asunder--and broke down a considerable portion of the
wall--walking into the city over the ruins, and occasioning great alarm
amidst the inhabitants.

The king is said to have attributed this extraordinary feat of strength
to the chieftain's having entered into a compact with the devil; and the
people generally believed the king to be correct.

At Tavistock, it was the custom of Ordulph to stand with one foot on
either side of the Tavy, which is about twenty feet wide, and having the
wild beasts driven in from the Dartmoor forests, he would--with the
seemingly insignificant blows of a small knife--strike their heads off
into the stream. \[a\]

\[a\] William of Malmesbury tells us that both father and son were
buried at Tavistock, which is thus described - Est in Domnonia caenobium
monachorum, juxta Tau fiuvium, quod Tavistock vocator; quod per
Ordgarum, comitem Domnoniensem, patrem Elffilda, gui fuit uxor regis
Edgari, surgendi exordium, per Livinguns episcopum, cresendi accepit
auspicium locus, amaenus opportunitate nemorum, captura copiosa piscum,
Ecclesiae congruente fabriea, fluvialibus rivis per officinas monachorum
decurrentibus, qui suo impetu effusi, quidquid invenerint superfium,
portant in exitum." Quoted by Pedler in his "Episcopate of Cornwall."

Mrs Bray, in her "Traditions, Legends, Superstitions, and Sketches of
Devonshire," says,--"But notwithstanding the superiority of his strength
and stature, Ordulph died in the flower of his age. He gave orders to be
buried at his abbey at Herton, in Dorsetshire; but was interred in or
near the Abbey Church of Tavistock, where a mausoleum or tomb of vast
dimensions was erected to his memory, which is represented to have been
visited as a wonder. 'The thigh-bone of Ordulph is still preserved in
Tavistock Church."
