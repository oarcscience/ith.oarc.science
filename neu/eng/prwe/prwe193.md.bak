WARNINGS AND "TOKENS."

AMONGST the mining population there is a deeply-rooted belief in
warnings. The following, related by a very respectable man, formerly a
miner, well illustrates this -

"My father, when a lad, worked with a companion (James or 'Jim,' as he
was called) in Germo. They lived close by Old Wheal Grey in Breage. One
evening, the daughter of the person with whom they lodged came in to her
mother, crying, 'Billy and Jim ben out theer for more than a hour, and I
ben chasm them among the Kilyur banks, and they waan't ler me catch
them. As fast as I do go to one, they do go to another.' 'Hould your
tongue, child,' said the mother; ''twas their forenoon core, and they
both ben up in bed this hours.' 'I 'm sure I ben chasm them,' said the
girl. The mother then went up-stairs and awoke the lads, telling them
the story. One of them said, ''Tis a warning; somethin will happen in un
old end, and I shan't go to mine this core.' 'Nonsense,' said the other;
'don't let us be so foolish;. the child has been playing with some
strangers, and it isn't worth while to be spaled for any such
foolishness.' 'I tell you,' replied the other,' I won't go.' As it was
useless for one man to go alone, both remained away. In the course of
the night, however a run took place in the end they were working in, and
tens of thousands of kibblefuls came away. Had they been at work, it was
scarcely possible for them to have escaped."

At Wheal Vor it has always been and is now believed that a fatal
accident in the mine is presaged by the appearance of a hare or white
rabbit in one of the engine-houses. The men solemnly declare that they
have chased these appearances till they were hemmed in apparently,
without being able to catch thçm. The white rabbit on one occasion being
*run into a "windbore"* lying on the ground, *and, though stopped in,*
escaped.

In this mine there appears to be a general belief among the men in
"tokens" and supernatural appearances. A few months since, a fine old
man reported, on being relieved from his turn as watcher, that during
the night he heard a loud sound like the emptying of a cartload of
rubbish in front of the account-house, where he was staying. On going
out, nothing was to be seen. The poor fellow, considering the strange
sound as a "warning," pined away and died within a few weeks.
