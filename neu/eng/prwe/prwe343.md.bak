ROCK MASSES, CELTIC

"THE Celts, or Keλτοί, or Keλταί were a people of the origin of which
nothing positive is known. They occupied a great part of Western Europe
perhaps in times antecedent to the invasion of Indo-Germanic nations.

"The very name *Celt* is of uncertain etymology. Ammian derives it from
the king, *Kelta*, or *Celta*; Leibnitz, from the German *gelt*, or
*geld,* money; Mezerai, from the British *gall*, or *gault*, a forest;
Pellontier, from the Tudesk *wallen*, to wander; Latour d'Auvergne, from
*gael*, or *gall*, yellow, alluding to the light hair of the Galli, whom
Bochart identtfies with *Dodanim* (for Rhodanim) of Gen. x. \[a\[

"But the name of Cell may probably come, as Camden says, from *gwalth*,
a head of hair; *coma*, and *gwalthay*, *comatus*; from whence Keλταί.
Γαλταί, or Γαλτοί, *Galli* or *Gauls*, the *Gaedil*, *Caedil*, or Keile,
and in pl. *Keilt*, or *Keiltiet*, or *Gaels*, *Gaedels*, or
*Guidhelod*, as the Irish call themselves and their tongue.

"The language called Celtic is divided into two principal
branches--viz., 1. The Irish or Hibernian, from which the present
*Irish*, or *Erse*, and the Gaelic of Scotland are derived. 2. The
*British*, to which the primitive Gaellic or Gallic are allied, and from
which are derived the *Welsh*, the *Cornish*, and the *Armoric*, or
language of Brittany." \[b\]

"The Welsh, which is the relic of the language of the inland Britons, or
Caesar's aborigines, is most probably akin to the dialect of *Gallia
Celtica*, and the Cornish to the idiom of the Belgae, who overran the
southern district of England, and probably sought refuge in the west
when the Saxons were extending themselves from the eastern part of the
island." \[c\]

But surely there are indications of a people inhabiting Cornwall long
before the Saxons gained a foot of ground in England?
