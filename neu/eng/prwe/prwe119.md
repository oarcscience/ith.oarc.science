THE LUGGER OF CROFT PASCO POOL

IN the midst of the dreary waste of Gornhilly, which occupies a large
portion of the Lizard promontory, is a large piece of water known as
"Croft Pasco Pool," where it is said at night the form of a ghostly
vessel may be seen floating with lug-sails spread. A more dreary, weird
spot could hardly be selected for a witches' meeting; and the Lizard
folks were always--a fact--careful to be back before dark, preferring to
suffer inconvenience, to risking a sight of the ghostly lugger.
Unbelieving people attributed the origin of the tradition to a white
horse seen in a dim twilight standing in the shallow water; but this was
indignantly rejected by the mass of the residents.
