<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE DUKE OF RESTORMEL</p>
<P>
&nbsp;A VERY singular custom
formerly prevailed at Lostwithiel, in Cornwall, on Easter Sunday. The
freeholders of the town and manor having assembled together, either in
person or by their deputies, one among them, each in his turn, gaily
attired and gallantly mounted, with a sceptre in his hand, a crown on his
head, and a sword borne before him, and respectfully attended by all the
rest on horseback, rode through the principal street in solemn state to
the church. At the churchyard stile, the curate, or other minister,
approached to meet him in reverential pomp, and then conducted him to
church to hear divine service. On leaving the church, he repaired, with
the same pomp and retinue, to a house previously prepared for his
reception. Here a feast, suited to the dignity he had assumed, awaited him
and his suite; and, being, placed at the head of the table, he was served,
kneeling, with all the rites and ceremonies that a real prince might
expect. This ceremony ended with the dinner; the prince being voluntarily
disrobed, and descending from his momentary exaltation, to mix with common
mortals. On the origin of this custom but one opinion can be reasonably
entertained, though it may be difficult to trace the precise period of its
commencement. It seems to have originated in the actual appearance of the
prince, who resided at Restormel Castle in former ages; but, on the
removal of royalty, this mimic grandeur stepped forth as its' shadowy
representative, and continued for many generations as a memorial to
posterity of the princely magnificence with which Lostwithiel had formerly
been honoured. [a]</p>
<P>This custom is now almost forgotten, and Lostwithiel
has little to disturb its quiet.</p>
