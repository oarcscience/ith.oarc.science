<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LAST OF THE KILLIGREWS</p>
<P>LADY JANE, the widow of Sir John Killigrew, sate in one
of the windows of Arwenick house, looking out upon the troubled waters of
Falmouth Harbour. A severe storm had prevailed for some days, and the
Cornish coast was strewn with wrecks. The tempest had abated; the waves were
subsiding, though they still beat heavily against the rocks. A light scud
was driving over the sky, and a wild and gloomy aspect suffused all things.
There was a sudden outcry amongst a group of men, retainers of the Killigrew
family, which excited the attention of Lady Jane Killigrew. She was not left
long in suspense as to the cause. In a few minutes two Dutch ships were seen
coming into the harbour. They had evidently endured the beat of the storm,
for they were both considerably disabled; and with the fragments of sail
which they carried, they laboured heavily. At length, however, these vessels
were brought round within the shelter of Pendennis; their anchors were cast
in good anchoring-ground; and they were safe, or at least the crew thought
so, in comparatively smooth water.</p>
<P>As was the custom in those days, the boat belonging to
the Killigrew family, manned by the group of whom we have already spoken,
went off as soon as the ships were anchored and boarded them. They then
learnt that they were of the Hanse Towns, laden with valuable merchandise
for Spain, and that this was in the charge of two Spanish factors. On the
return of the boat's crew, this was reported to Lady Killigrew; and she,
being a very wicked and most resolute woman, at once proposed that they
should return to the ships, and either rob them of their treasure, or exact
from the merchants a large sum of money in compensation. The rude men, to
whom wrecking and plundering was but too familiar, were delighted with the
prospect of a rare prize; and above all, when Lady Killigrew declared that
she would herself accompany them, they were wild with joy.</p>
<P>With great shouting, they gathered together as many men
as the largest boat in the harbour would carry, and armed themselves with
pikes, swords, and daggers. Lady Jane Killigrew, also armed, placed herself
in the stem of the boat after the men had crowded into their places, and
with a wild huzzah they left the shore, and were soon alongside of the
vessel nearest to the shore. A number of the men immediately crowded up the
side and on to the deck of this vessel, and at once seized upon the captain
and the factor, threatening them with instant death if they dared to make
any outcry. Lady Jane Killigrew was now lifted on to the deck of the vessel,
and the boat immediately pushed <i>off, </i>and the remainder of the crew
boarded the other ship.</p>
<P>The Dutch crew were overpowered by the numbers of
Cornishmen, who were armed far more perfectly than they. Taken unawares as
they were, at a moment when they thought their troubles were for a season at
an end, the Dutchmen were almost powerless.</p>
<P>The Spaniards were brave men, and resisted the demands
made to deliver up their treasure. This resistance was, however, fatal to
them. At a signal, it is said by some, given by their leader, Lady Jane
Killigrew,--although this was denied afterwards,--they were both murdered
by the ruffians into whose hands they had fallen, and their bodies cast
overboard into the sea.</p>
<P>These wretches ransacked the ships, and appropriated
whatsoever they pleased, while Lady Jane took from them &quot;two hogsheads of
Spanish pieces of eight, and converted them to her own use.&quot;</p>
<P>As one of the Spanish factors was dying, he lifted his
hands to heaven, prayed to the Lord to receive his soul, and turning to the
vile woman to whose villainy he owed his death, he said, &quot;My blood will
linger with you until my death is avenged upon your own sons.&quot; </p>
<P>This dreadful deed was not allowed to pass without notice
even in those lawless times. The Spaniards were then friendly with England,
and upon the representation made by the Spanish minister to the existing
government, the sheriff of Cornwall was ordered to seize and bring to trial
Lady Jane Killigrew and her crew of murderers. A considerable number were
arrested with her; and that lady and several of her men were tried at
Launceston.</p>
<P>Since the Spaniards were proved to be at the time of the
murder &quot;foreigners under the Queen's protection,&quot; they were all found
guilty, and condemned to death<sub>.</p>
</sub>
<P>All the men were executed on the walls of Launceston
Castle; but by the interest of Sir John Arundell and Sir Nicholas Hals,
Queen Elizabeth was induced to grant a pardon for Lady Jane.</p>
<P>How Lady Jane Killigrew lived, and when she died, are
matters on which even tradition, by which the story is preserved, is silent.
We know, however, that her immediate descendant, John Killigrew, who married
one of the Monks,, and his son William Killigrew, who was made a baronet in
1660 by Charles II., were only known for the dissoluteness of character, and
the utter regardless-ness of every feeling of an exalted character which
they displayed.. Sir William Killigrew, by his ill conduct and his
extravagant habits, wasted all the basely-gotten treasure, and sold the
manor and barton of Arwenick to his younger brother, Sir Peter Killigrew.
With the son of this Peter the baronetcy became extinct. The last Sir Peter
Killigrew, however, improved his fortune by marrying one of the coheirs of
Judge Twisden. Sir Peter and his wife, of whom we know nothing, died,
leaving one son, George Killigrew, who connected himself with the St Aubyn
family by marriage. This man appears to have inherited many of the vices of
his family. He was given to low company, and towards the close of his life
was remarkable only for his drunken habits.</p>
<P>He was one evening in a tavern in Penryn, surrounded by
his usual companions, and with them was one Walter Vincent, a
barrister-at-law. The wine flowed freely; songs and locrie conversation were
the order of the night. At length all were in a state of great excitement
through the extravagance of their libations, and something was said by
George Killigrew very insultingly to Walter Vincent.</p>
<P>Walter Vincent does not appear to have been naturally a
depraved man, but of violent passions. Irritated by Killidrew, he made some
remarks on the great-grandmother being sentenced to be hanged. Swords were
instantly drawn by the drunken men. They lunged at each other. Vincent's
sword passed directly through Killigrew's body and he fell dead in the midst
Of his revelries, at the very moment when he was defending the character of
her who had brought dishonour upon them.</p>
<P>This Walter Vincent was tried for the murder of George
Killigrew, but acquitted. We are told by the Cornish historian, &quot;Yet this Mr
Vincent, through anguish and horror at this accident (as it was said),
within two years after, wasted of an extreme atrophy of his flesh and
spirits; that, at length, at the table whereby he was sitting, in the Bishop
of Exeter's palace, in the presence of divers gentleman, he instantly fell
back against the wall and died.&quot;</p>
<P>George Killigrew left one daughter; but of her progress
in life we know nothing. Thus the Cornish Killigrews ceased to be a name in
the land.</p>
<P>Such a tale as this does not, of course, exist without
many remarkable additions. Ghosts and devils of various kinds are spoken of
as frequenting Arwenick House, and the woods around it.Those spectral and
demoniacal visitations have not, however, any special interest. They are
only, indeed, repetitions of oft-told tales.</p>
