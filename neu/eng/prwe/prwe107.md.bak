THE HAUNTED WIDOWER

A LABOURING man, very shortly after his wife's death, .sent to a servant
girl, living at the time in a small shipping port, requesting her to
come to the inn to him. The girl went, and over a "ha' pint" she agreed
to accept him as her husband.

All went on pleasantly enough for a time. One evening the man met the
girl. He was silent for some time and sorrowful, but at length he told
her his wife had come back.

"What do'st mean?" asked the girl; "have 'e seen hur?"

"Naw, I han't seed her."

"Why, how do'st knaw it is her then?"

The poor man explained to her, that at night, when in bed, she would
come to the side of it, and "flop" his face; and there was no mistaking
her "flop."

"So you knawed her flop, did 'e?" asked the girl.

"Ay, it couldn't be mistook."

"If she do hunt thee," said the girl, "she 'II hunt me; and if she do
flop 'e, she 'II flop me,--so it must be off atween us."

The unfortunate flop of the dead wife prevented the man from securing a
living one.
