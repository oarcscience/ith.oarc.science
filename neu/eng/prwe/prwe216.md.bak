SIR JOHN ARUNDELL.

IN the first year of the reign of Edward IV., the brave Sir John
Arundell dwelt on the north coast of Cornwall, at a place called Efford,
on the coast near Stratton. He was a magistrate, and greatly esteemed
amongst men for his honourable conduct. He had, however, in his official
capacity, given offence to a wild shepherd, who had by some means
acquired considerable influence over the minds of the people, under the
impression of his possessing some supernatural powers. This man had been
imprisoned by Arundell, and on his return home he constantly waylaid the
knight, and, always looking threateningly at him, slowly muttered,--

"When upon the yellow sand,  
Thou shalt die by human hand."

Notwithstanding the bravery of Sir John Arundell, he was not free from
the superstitions of the period. He might, indeed, have been impressed
with the idea that this man intended to murder him. It is, however,
certain that he removed from Efford on the sands, to the wood-clad hills
of Trerice, and here he lived for some years without the annoyance of
meeting his old enemy. In the tenth year of Edward IV., Richard de Vere,
Earl of Oxford, seized St Michael's Mount. Sir John Arundell, then
sheriff of Cornwall, gathered together his own retainers and a large
host of volunteers, and led them to the attack on St Michael's Mount.
The retainers of the Earl of Oxford, on one occasion, left the castle,
and made a sudden rush upon Arundell's followers, who were encamped on
the sands near Marazion. Arundell then received his death-wound.
Although he left Efford "to counteract the will of fate," the prophecy
was fulfilled; and in his dying moments, it is said his old enemy
appeared, singing joyously,--

"When upon the yellow sand,  
Thou shalt die by human hand."
