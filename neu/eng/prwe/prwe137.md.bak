ST NEOT AND THE DOE.

 Again, on another day, when the hermit was in his fountain, a lovely
doe, flying from the huntsmen, fell down on the edge of the well,
imploring, 'with tearful eyes and anxious pantings, the aid of St Neot.
The dogs followed in full chase, ready to pounce on the trembling doe,
and eager to tear her in pieces. They saw the saint, and one look from
his holy eyes sent them flying back into the wood, more speedily, if
possible, than they rushed out of it.

 The huntsman too came on, ready to discharge his arrow into the heart
of the doe; but, impressed with the sight he saw, he fell on his knees,
cast away his quiver, and became from that day a follower of the
saint's, giving him his horn to hang, as a memorial, in the church,
where it was long to be seen. The huntsman be­came eventually one of the
monks of the neighbouring house of St Petroch.
