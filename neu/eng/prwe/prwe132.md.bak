HOW ST PIRAN REACHED CORNWALL.

GOOD men are frequently persecuted by those whom they have benefited the
most. The righteous Piran had, by virtue of his sanctity, been enabled
to feed ten Irish kings and their armies for ten days together with
three cows. He brought to life by his prayers the dogs which had been
killed while hunting the elk and the boar, and eyen restored to
existence many of the warriors who had fallen on the battle-field.
Notwithstanding this, and his incomparable goodness, some of these kings
condemned him to be cast off a precipice into the sea, with a millstone
around his neck.

On a boisterous day, a crowd of the lawless Irish assembled on the brow
of a beetling cliff, with Piran in chains. By great labour they had
rolled a huge millstone to the top of the hill, and Piran was chained to
it. At a signal from one of the kings, the stone and the saint were
rolled-to the edge of and suddenly over, the cliff intd the Atlantic.
The winds were blowing tempestuously, the heavens were dark with clouds,
and the waves white with crested foam. No sooner was Piran and the
millstone launched into space, than the sun shone out brightly, casting
the full lustre of its beams on the holy man, who sat tranquilly on the
descending stone. The winds died away, and th\~ waves became smooth as a
mirror. The moment the millstone touched the water, hundreds were
converted to Christianity who saw this miracle. St Piran floated on
safely to Cornwall; he landed on the 5th of March on the sands which
bear his name. He lived amongst the Cornish men until he attained the
age of 206 years. \[a\]

is written Piran, Peran, and Perran.
