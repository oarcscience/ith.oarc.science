LEGENDS OF THE SAINTS.

"This likë monk let olde thinges pace,  
And held after the newë world the trace.  
He gave not of the text a pulled hen,  
That saith, that hunters be not holy men,  
Ne that a monk, when he is reckëless,  
Is like to a fish that is waterless;  
This is to say, a monk out of his cloister,  
This like text held he not worth an oyster,  
And I say his opinion was good."

-- The Canterbury Tales:-- CHAUCER.

THE process through which a man, who has made himself remarkable to his
ignorant fellow-men, is passed after death *-- first,* into the hero
performing fabulous exploits, and eventually into the giant -- is not
difficult to understand.

The remembrance of great deeds, and the memory of virtues,-- even in
modem days, when the exaggerations of votaries are subdued by the
influence of education,--ever tends to bring them out in strong contrast
with the surrounding objects. The mass of men form the background, as it
were, of the picture, and the hero or the saint stands forth in all his
brightness of colour in the foreground.

Amidst the uneducated Celtic population who inhabited Old Cornwall, it
was the practice, as with the Celts of other countries, to exalt their
benefactors with all the adornments of that hyperbole which
distinguishes their songs and stories. When the first Christian
missionaries dwelt amongst this people, they impressed them with the
daring which they exhibited by the persecution which they
uncomplainingly endured and the holy lives they led.

Those who were morally so superior to the living men, were represented
as physically so to their children, and every generation adorned the
relation which it had received with the ornaments derived from their own
imaginations, which had been tutored amidst the severer scenes of
nature; and consequently the warrior, or the holy man, was transmuted
into the giant.

If to this we add the desire which was constantly shown by the earlier
priesthood to persuade the people of their miraculous powers -- of the
direct interference of Heaven in their behalf--and of the violent
conflicts which they were occasionally enduring with the enemy of the
human race, there will be no difficulty in marking out the steps by
which the ordinary man has become an extraordinary hero. 'When we hear
of the saints to whose memories the parish churches are dedicated, being
enabled to hurl rocks of enormous size through the air, to carry them in
their pockets, and indeed to use them as playthings, we perceive that
the traditions of the legitimate giants have been transferred to, and
mixed up with, the memories of a more recent people.

In addition to legends of the Titanic type, this section will include a
few of the true monastic character. The only purpose I have in giving
these is to preserve, as examples, some curious superstitions which have
not yet entirely lost their hold on the people.
