SHAM MAYORS.

III --THE MAYOR OF HALGAVER MOOR.

 The people of Bodmin had an old custom of assembling in large numbers
on Halgaver Moor in the month of July, and electing a "Mayor of
Misrule," for the punishment of petty offenders. Our old historian gives
a quaint description. "The youthlyer sort of Bodmin townsmen use
sometimes to sport themselves by playing the box with strangers, whom
they summon to Halgaver; the name signifieth the Goats' Moore, and such
a place it is, lying a little without the town, and very full of
quagmires. When these mates meet with any raw serving-man or other young
master, who may serve and deserve to make pastime, they cause him to be
solemnly arrested for his appearance before the Mayor of Halgaver, where
he is charged with wearing, one spur, or wanting a girdle, or some such
like felony, and after he hath been arraigned and tried with all
requisite circumstances, judgment is given in formal terms, and executed
in some one ungracious prank or other, more to the scorn than hurt of
the party condemned. Hence is sprung rise proverb, when we see one
slovenly apparelled, to say, 'He shall be presented in Halgaver Court."
