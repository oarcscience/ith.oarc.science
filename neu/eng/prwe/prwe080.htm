PIPER'S HOLE, SCILLY</p>
<P><br>
ON the banks of Peninnis, in St Mary's, is
Piper's Hole, which communicates, as tradition saith, with the island of
Tresco, where another orifice known by the same name is seen. Going in at the
orifice at Peninnis Banks in St Mary's, it is above man's height, and of as
much space in its breadth, but grows lower and narrower farther in a little
beyond which entrance appear rocky basins, or reservoirs, continually running
over with fresh water, descending as it distils from the sides of the rocky
passage. By the fall of water heard further in, it is probable there may be
rocky descents in the passage. The drippings from the sides have worn the
passage, as far as it can be seen, into very various angular surfaces. Strange
stories are related of this passage, of men going so far in that they never
returned; of dogs going quite through, and coming out at Tresco, with most of
their hair off; and such like incredibles. But its retired situation, where
lovers retreat to indulge their mutual passion-, has made it almost as famous
as the cave wherein Dido and Aeneas met of old. Its water is exceeding good.

[ a] Heath's "Scilly Isles." These stories of Piper's Hole are still
told, and many of the ignorant
inhabitants regard it with superstitious dread. The Fugoe Hole, at the Land's
End, has yet to be spoken of in the Witch stories. Several who have
attempted to penetrate this hole have escaped only by great luck --" by the skin
of their teeth," as the saving is.</p>
