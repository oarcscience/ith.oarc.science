ON WASHING LINEN

 "THEY that wash Monday got all the week to dry,  
They that wash Tuesday are pretty near by,  
They that wash Wednesday make a good housewife,  
They that wash Thursday must wash for their life,  
They that wash Friday must wash in need,  
They that wash Saturday are sluts indeed."
