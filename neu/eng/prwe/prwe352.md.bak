MILLINGTON OF PENGERSWICK

IN the reign of Henry VIII., one Militon, or Millington, appears to have
purchased Pengerswick Castle. This Millington is said to have retired
into the solitude of this place on account of a murder which he had
committed. (Mr. Wilkie Collins appears to have founded his novel of
"Basil" on this tradition.) In all probability a very much older story
is adapted to Mr. Millington. So far from his being a recluse, we learn
of his purchasing St. Michael's Mount, "whose six daughters and heirs
invested their husbands and purchasers therewith."

That Millington was a man of wealth, and that large possessions were
held by his family, is sufficiently evident. St. Michael's Mount appears
to have been "granted at first for a term of years to different
gentlemen of the neighbourhood. To Millington, supposed of Pengerswick,
in Breage; to Harris, of Kenegie, in Gulval; and, perhaps jointly with
Millington, to a Billett or Bennett."--*Hals*.
