<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE DISCOVERER OF TIN</p>
<P>BY an anachronism of fifteen hundred years or more,
of Perran was considered as the person who first found tin; and this
conviction induced the miners to celebrate his day, the 5th of March,
with so much hilarity, that any one unable to guide himself along the
road has received the appellation of a Perraner; and that, again, has
most unjustly reflected as a habit on the saint.</p>
<P>&quot;It may here be worthy of remark, that, as the miners
impute the discovery of tin to St Perran, so they ascribe its reduction
from the ore, in a large way, to an imaginary person, St Chiwidden; but
<i>chi-wadden</i> is white house, and must, therefore, mean a smelting
or blowing-house, where the black ore of tin is converted into a white
metal.</p>
<P>&quot;A white cross on a black ground was formerly the
banner of St Perran, and the standard of Cornwall; probably with some
allusion to the black ore and the white metal of tin. &quot;-- <i>Gilberl</i>.</p>
<P>A college, dedicated to St Perran, once stood in the
parish of St Kevern (Dugdale's &quot;Monasticon,&quot; vol vi. p. 1449). This
probably had some connection' with Perran Uthnoe. The shrine of St
Perran was in that parish, which is said to have contained his head, and
other relics.</p>
<P>Lysons quotes a deed in the registry of Exeter,
showing the great resort of pilgrims hither in 1485.</p>
<P>In the will of Sir John Arundell, 1433, occurs this
bequest:-- &quot; Item, lego ad usum parochie S'c'i' Pyerani in Zabulo, ad
clandendum capud S. Pierani honorific&#232; et meliori modo quo sciunt xls.
&quot;--<i> Collecetanea Topogr. el Geneal</i>., vol. iii. p. 392.</p>
<P>For a full examination of the question, Did the
Phoenicians trade with Britain for tin? the following works should be
consulted :--&quot; History of Maritime and Inland Discovery,&quot; by W. D.
Cooley; &quot;Historical Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients,&quot; by Sir
George Cornewall Lewis; &quot;Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients,&quot; by W.
Vincent, D.D.; &quot;Phoeanicia,&quot; by John Kenrick, M. A. ;. &quot;The Cassiterides:

Europe, with Particular Reference to the British Tin Trade,&quot; by George
Smith, LL.D., F.A.S.</p>
