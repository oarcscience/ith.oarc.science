THE FAIRY REVEL.

  
RICHARD also once witnessed a fairy revel in the Towen--upon which
tables were spread, with the utmost profusion of gold and silver
ornaments, and fruits and flowers. Richard however, according to the
statement of " Aunt Alcey" (the name by which his wife was familiarly
called), very foolishly interrupted the feast by some exclamation of
surprise; whereas, had he but touched the end of a table with his
finger, it would have been impossible for the fairy host to have removed
an article, as that which has been touched by mortal fingers becomes to
them accursed. As it was, the lovely vision faded before the eyes of the
astonished labourer.
