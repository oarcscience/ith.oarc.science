stone in his cairn," meaning he shall see him buried.

 "*Curri mi clack er du cuirn*" is the expression of a Scotch Highlander
(Labbach's *Prehistoric Times*). This is interpreted as a mark of
respect, or, I will do something to build you a monument.

In the parish of Breage, the habit of prefixing names to the people is
