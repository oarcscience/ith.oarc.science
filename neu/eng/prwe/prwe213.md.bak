WHIPPING THE HAKE.

IT is not improbable that the saying applied to the people of one of the
Cornish fishing-towns, of" Who whipped the hake ?" may be explained by
the following

:--

"Lastly, they are persecuted by the hakes, who (not long silence)
haunted the coast in great abundance; but now being deprived of their
wonted bait, are much diminished, verifying the proverb, *'What we lose
in hake we shall have in herring'." - Carew, Survey,* p. 34.

Annoyed with the hakes, the seiners may, in their ignorance have
actually served one of those fish as indicated.
