<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MIGRATORY BIRDS.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;I FIND a belief still prevalent amongst the people in the
outI lying districts of Cornwall, that such birds as the cuckoo and the
swallow remain through the winter in deep caves, cracks in the earth, and
in hollow trees; and instances have been cited of these birds having been
found in a torpid state in the mines, and in hollow pieces of wood. This
belief appears to be of some antiquity, for Carew writes in his &quot;Survey of
Cornwall&quot; as follows :-- </p>
<P>&quot;In the west parts of Cornwall, during the winter season,
swallows are</p>
<P>found sitting in old deep tynne-works, and holes in the
sea cliffes; but touching their lurking-places, <i>Olaus .Msgnus</i>
maketh a far stranger report. For he saith that in the north parts of the
world, as summer weareth out, they clap mouth to mouth, wing to wing, and
legge to legge, and so, after a sweet singing, fall downe into certain
lakes or pools amongst the caves, from whence at the next spring they
receive a new resurrection; and he addeth, for proofe thereof, that the
fishermen who make holes in the ice, to dig up such fish in their nets as
resort thither for breathing, doe sometimes light on these swallows
conge..lled in clods, of a slymie substance, and that, carrying them home
to their stoves, the warmth restored them to life and flight.&quot;</p>
<P>A man employed in the granite quarries near Penryn,
informed me that he found such a &quot; slymie substance&quot; in one of the pools
in the quarry where he was working, that he took it home, warmth proved it
to be a bird, but when it began to move it was seized by the cat, who ran
out on the downs and devoured it.</p>
