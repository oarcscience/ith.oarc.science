THE GIANTS AT PLAY.

  
IN several parts of Cornwall there are evidences that these Titans were
a sportive race. Huge rocks are preserved to show where they played at
trap-ball, at hurling, and other athletic games. The giants of
Trecrobben and St Michael's Mount often met for a game at bob-buttons.
The Mount was the "bob," on which flat masses of granite were placed to
serve as buttons, and Trecrobben Hill was the "mit," or the spot from
which the throw was made. This order was sometimes reversed. On the
outside of St Michael's Mount, many a granite slab which had been
knocked off the "bob" is yet to be 'found; and numerous piles of rough
cubical masses of the same rock, said to be the granite of Trecrobben
Hill, \[a\] show how eagerly the game was played.

Trecrobben Hill was well chosen by the giants as the site of their
castle. From it they surveyed the country on every side and friend or
enemy was seen at a considerable distance as he approached the guarded
spot. It is as clear as tradition can make it, that Trecrobben was the
centre of a region full of giants. On Lescudjack Hill, close to
Penzance, there is "The Giant's Round," evidently the scene of many a
sanguinary conflict, since the Cornish antiquarian authority Borlase
informs us, that Lesgudzhek signifies the "Castle of the Bloody Field."
On the cairn at Gulval are several impressions on the rocks, all
referable to the giants. In Madron there is the celebrated "Giant's
Cave;" and the well-known Lanyon cromlech is reported by some to be the
" Giant's Coit," while others declare it to be the " Giant's Table."
Cairn Gaiva, again, is celebrated for its giant; and, indeed, every hill
within sight has some monument preserving the memory of those, "the
Titans fierce."

\[a\] Mr O. Halliwell, who carefully followed in the" Footsteps of the
Giants," referring to this game as played by them, says:-- "Doubtlessly
the Giant's Chair on Trink Hill was frequently used during the progress
of the game, nor is it improbable that the Giant's Well was also in
requisition. Here, then, were at hand opportunities for rest and
refreshment--the circumstances of the various traditions agreeing well
with, and, in fact, demonstrating the truth of each other."
