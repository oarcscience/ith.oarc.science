THE FAIRY MINERS--THE KNOCKERS.

  
AT Ransom Mine the "Knockers" were always very active in their
subterranean operations. In every part of the mine their "knockings"
were heard, but most especially were they busy in one particular "end."
There was a general impression that great wealth must exist at this part
of the "lode." Yet, notwithstanding the inducements of very high
"tribute" were held out to the miners, no pair of men could be found
brave enough to venture on the ground of the "Bockles." An old man and
his son, called Trenwith, who lived near Bosprenis, went out one
midsummer eve, about midnight, and watched until they saw the "Smae
People" bringing up the shining ore. It is said they were possessed of
some secret by which they could communicate with the fairy people. Be
this as it may, they told the little miners that they would save them
all the trouble of breaking down the ore, that they would bring "to
grass" for them, one-tenth of the "richest stuff," and leave it properly
dressed, if they would quietly give them up this end. An agreement of
some kind was come to. The old man and his son took the "pitch," and in
a short time realised much wealth. The old man never failed to keep to
his bargain, and leave the tenth of the ore for his friends. He died.
The son was avaricious and selfish. He sought to cheat the Knockers, but
he ruined himself by so doing. The "lode" failed; nothing answered with
him; disappointed, he took to drink, squandered all the money his father
had made, and died a beggar.
