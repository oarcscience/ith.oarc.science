THE SPRIGGANS OF TRENCROM HILL.

  
IT is not many years since a man, who thought he was fully informed as
to the spot in which a crock of the giant's gold was buried, proceeded
on one fine moonlight night to this enchanted hill, and with spade and
pick commenced his search. He proceeded for some time without
interruption, and it became evident to him that the treasure was not far
off. The sky was rapidly covered with the darkest clouds, shutting out
the brilliant light o the moon--which had previously gemmed each
cairn--and leaving the gold-seeker in total and unearthly darkness. The
wind rose, and roared terrifically amidst the rocks; but this was soon
drowned amidst the fearful crashes of thunder, which followed in quick
succession the flashes of lightning. By its light the man perceived that
the spriggans were coming out in swarms from all the rocks. They were in
countless numbers; and although they were small at first, they rapidly
increased in size, until eventually they assumed an almost giant form,
looking all the while, as he afterwards said, "as ugly as if they would
eat him." How this poor man escaped is unknown, but he is said to have
been so frightened that he took to his bed, and was not able to work for
a long time.
