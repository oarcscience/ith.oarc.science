THE HARLYN PIE \[a\]

ADJOINING the Church of Constantine in the parish of St Merryn, was a
cottage which a family of the name of Edwards held for generations,
under the proprietors of Harlyn, by the annual render of a pie, made of
limpets, raisins, and various herbs, on the eve of the festival in
honour of the saint to whom the church was dedicated. The pie, as I have
heard from my family, and from more ancient members of the family, and
from old servants, was excellent. The Edwards had pursued for centuries
the occupation of shepherds on Harlyn and Constantine Commons. The last
died about forty years ago, and the wreck of their cottage is almost
buried in the sand.<sup>"</sup> \[b\]
