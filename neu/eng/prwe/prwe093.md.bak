THE CHAPEL ROCK, PERRAN-PORTH.

   
THIS is one of the rocks--of which many exist--around the Cornish coast,
upon which, at one time, there stood, in all probability, a small chapel
or oratory. This rock is left dry at every tide, but stands far out in
the sea at high-water. A curious fancy exists with respect to it. It is
said that this rock can be approached on dry sand every day at eleven
o'clock throughout the year. There is no truth in this statement, but
strangers are gravely assured that this is the fact. From this rock to
the sandy peninsula which runs out in the "porth," or port, is about
five hundred yards--those, it is said, were, at one time, connected by
cultivated land. From the circumstance that the evidences of a
burial-place have been found on the little peninsula, it appears highly
probable that the island and it have been closely connected as church
and graveyard. Tradition refers the destruction of the land to certain
storms or convulsions which swept away the country, for a mile or two
out at sea, marked by a line drawn from the rocks off St Agnes, known as
"The Man and his Man," and "Carters' Rock," which is off Penhale Point.
