THE TWELFTH CAKE.

THE custom, apparently a very ancient one, of putting certain, articles
into a rich cake, is still preserved in many districts. Usually,
sixpence, a wedding-ring, and a silver thimble are employed. These are
mixed up with the dough, and baked in the cake. At night the cake is
divided. The person who secures the sixpence will not want money for
that year; the one who has the, ring will be the first married; and the
possessor of the thimble will die an old maid.

"Then also every householder,  
To his abilitie  
Doth make a mighty cake, that may  
Suffice his companie:  
Herein a pennie doth he put,  
Before it come to fire;  
This he divides according as  
His household doth require,  
And every peece distributethAs round about they stand,  
Which in their names unto the poor  
Is given out of hand.  
But who so chanceth on the peece  
Wherein the money lies,  
Is counted king amongst them all;  
And is with shoutes and cries  
Exalted to the heavens up."  
--Naogeorgus's Popish Kingdom.
