CORNISH TEENY-TINY

M. HALLIWELL gives us, in his "Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales," the
story of Teeny-tiny. In this a little old woman takes a bone from the
churchyard to make soup. She goes to bed, and puts the bone in the
cupboard. During the night some one comes demanding the bone, and at
length the terrified old woman gives it up.

A similar story is told in Comwall.

An old lady had been to the church in the sands of Perranzabuloe. She
found, amidst the numerous remains of mortality, some very good teeth.
She pocketed these, and at night placed them on her dressing-table
before getting into bed. She slept, but was at length disturbed by some
one calling out, "Give me my teeth--give my teeth." At first, the lady
took no notice of this, but the cry, "Give me my teeth," was so
constantly repeated, that she, at last, in terror, jumped out of bed,
took the teeth from the dressing-table, and, opening the window, flung
them out, exclaiming, "Drat the teeth, take 'em." They no sooner fell
into the darkness on the road than hasty retreating footsteps were
heard, and there were no more demands for the teeth.
