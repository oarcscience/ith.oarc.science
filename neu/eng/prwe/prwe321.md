THE LIZARD PEOPLE

THERE is a tradition that the Lizard people were formerly a very
inferior race. In fact it is said that they went on all fours, till the
crew of a foreign vessel, wrecked on the coast, settled among them, and
improved the race so much that they became as remarkable for their
stature and physical development as they had been before for the
reverse. At this time, as a whole, the Lizard folks certainly have among
them a very large population of tall people, many of the men and women
being over six feet in height.
