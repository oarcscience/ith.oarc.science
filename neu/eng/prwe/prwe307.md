TEMPLE MOORS.

THE parish of Temple in 1851 had a population of 24. Yet once the
Knights Templar built a church here; and with the purpose of civilising
the inhabitants of the moor in the midst of which it was founded, they
secured for their temple some special privileges. "Many a bad marriage
bargain," says Tonkin, "is there yearly slubbered up**;** and grass
widows with their fatlings put to lie-in and nurse here." "Send her to
Temple Moors," implied that any female requiring seclusion might at one
time secure it under the charge of these Christian knights in this their
preceptory, and be returned to the world again, probably, in all
respects, a better woman. At all events, the world, being in ignorance,
did not repudiate the erring sister.

Stories linger over this wilderness of mixed good and evil. The church,
which was consecrated to the great cause of saving sinners, has
perished. No stone remains to tell us where it stood; and to "send her
to Temple moors," is to proclaim a woman an outcast from society.
