SHROVE TUESDAY AT ST IVES.

FORMERLY it was customary for the boys to tie stones to cords, and with
these parade the town, slinging these stones against the doors, shouting
aloud,--

"Give me a pancake, now--now--now,  
Or I 'II souse in your door with a row--tow--tow."

A genteel correspondent assures me "this is observed now in the lower
parts of the town only."
