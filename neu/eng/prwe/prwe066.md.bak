THE LOGAN OR LOGING ROCK. \[a\]

MODRED, in Mason's" Caractacus," addressing Vellinus and Elidurus,
says--

"Thither, youths,  
Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge  
And unhewn sphere of living adamant,  
Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight  
On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems,  
Such is the strange and virtuous property,  
It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch  
Of him whose breath is pure; but to a traitor,  
Though even a giant's prowess nerved his arm,  
It stands as fixed as Snowdon."

This faithfully preserves the traditionary idea of the purposes to which
this in every way remarkable rock was devoted.

Up to the time when Lieutenant Goldsmith, on the 8th of April 1824, slid
the rock off from its support, to prove the falsehood of Dr Borlase's
statement, that "it is morally impossible that any lever, or, indeed,
force, however applied in a mechanical way, can remove it from its
present position," the Logan Rock was believed to cure children, who
were rocked upon it at certain seasons, of several diseases; but the
charm is broken, although the rock is restored. \[b\]

\[a\] "It may be observed that I have always used the words Loging Rock
for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas. Much learned research seems
to have been idly expended on the supposed name, 'Logan Rock.' To log is
a verb in general use throughout Cornwall for vibrating or rolling like
a drunken man; and *an* is frequently heard in provincial pronunciation
for tug, characteristic of the modem present participle. The Loging Rock
is, therefore, strictly descriptive of its peculiar motlon." -- Davies
Gilbert.

\[b\] When this great natural curiosity was, as it was thought,
destroyed, the public wrath was excited, and appeased only' by the
conciliatory spirit manifested by Mr Davies Gilbert, who persuaded the
Lords of the Admiralty to lend Lieutenant Goldsmith the required
apparatus for replacing it. Mr D. Gilbert found the money; and after
making the necessary arrangements, on the ad of November 1824, Goldsmith
"had the glory of replacing this immense rock in its natural position."
The glory of Goldsmith and of Shrubsall, who overturned another large
Logan Rock, is certainly one not to be desired.
