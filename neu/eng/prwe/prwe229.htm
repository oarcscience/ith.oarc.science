<P ALIGN="CENTER">ALLHALLOWS-EVE AT ST IVES.</p>
<P>THE ancient custom of providing children with a large apple
on Allhallows-eve is still observed, to a great extent, at St Ives.
&quot;Allan-day,&quot; as it is called, is the day of days to hundreds' of children,
who would deem it a great misfortune were they to go to bed on &quot;Allan-night&quot;
without the time-honoured Allan apple to hide beneath their pillows. A
quantity of large apples are thus disposed of the sale of which is dignified
by the term Allan Market.</p>
