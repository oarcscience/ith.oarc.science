THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND

** **THE extirpation of the wolves, which once existed in every part of
these islands, is an oft-told story.

 But it is not generally known that the last native wolf lived in the
forests of Ludgvan, near Penzance. The last of his race was a gigantic
specimen, and terrible was the havoc made by him on the flocks.
Tradition tells us that at last he carried off a child. This could not
be endured, so the peasantry all turned out, and this famous wolf was
captured at Rospeith, the name of a farm still existing in Ludgvan.
