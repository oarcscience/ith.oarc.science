GOLDSITHNEY FAIR AND THE GLOVE

ON the 5th of August, St James's day (old style), a fair is held here,
which was originally held in the Church-town of Sithney near Helston.

In olden time, the good *St* *Perran the Little* gave to the wrestlers
in his parish a glove as the prize, and the winner of the glove was
permitted to collect the market toll on the day of the feast, and to
appropriate the money to his own use. The winner of the glove lived in
the Church-town of Sithney, and for long long years the right of holding
the fair remained undisputed.

At length the miners of Goldsithney resolved to contest the prize, and
they won it, since which time the fair has been held in that village,
they paying to the poor of the parish of Sithney one shilling as
compensation.

Gilbert remarks "The displaying of a glove at fairs is an ancient and
widely-extended custom. Mr Lysons says it is continued at Chester. The
editor has seen a large ornamented glove over the guildhall at Exeter
during the fairs." \[a\]
