<P ALIGN="CENTER">BOLAIT, THE FIELD OF BLOOD.</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<b>&nbsp;</b>TRADITION
asserts that it was on the spot, so called in the parish of Burian,
that the last battle was fought between the Cornish Britons and
Athelstan. This is, in some measure, confirmed by the discovery of
flint arrow-heads, in considerable quantities, from time to time, in
and near this &quot;field of slaughter.&quot;</p>
<P>We have little beyond the evidence of tradition to
guide us in regard to any of the triumphs of Athelstan in Cornwall. It
appears tolerably certain that this Saxon king confined the Cornish
Britons to the western side of the Tamar; thus breaking up the
division known as Danmonium, and limiting the territory over which the
kings of the west ruled.</p>
<P>Scattered over Cornwall, we have the evidence, in
the names of places, of Saxon possession. In all probability these
were the resting-places of portions of the Saxon army, or the district
in which fortified camps were placed by Athelstan to restrain a
turbulent people. Be this as it may, the battle at Bolait is said to
have raged from morning until night, and then, overpowered by numbers,
the Cornish who still survived fled to the hills, and thus left
Athelstan the conqueror.</p>
<P>It was after this fight that Athelstan, seeing the
islands of Scilly illumined by the setting sun, determined, if
possible, to achieve their conquest. He then recorded his vow, that he
would, if he returned victorious, build a church, which should be
dedicated to St Buryana. Of this church Hals writes as follows:-</p>
<P>&quot;BURIAN. --,This church was founded and endowed by
King Athelstan, about the year 930<b>, </b>after such time as he had
conquered the Scilly Islands, as also the county of Devon, and made
Cornwall tributary to Isis sceptre. To which church he gave lands and
tithes of a considerable value for ever, himself becoming the first
patron thereof, as his successors the kings of England have been ever
since; for which reason it is still called the royal rectory, or regal
rectory, and the royal or regal peculiar; signifying thereby that this
is the church or chapel pertaining to the king, or immediately under
the jurisdiction of him, as the supreme ordinary from whom there is no
appeal; whereas other peculiars, though exempt from the visitation or
jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop within whose see they stand, yet
are always subject to the provincial Archbishops of Canterbury or
York, or other persons.</p>
<P>&quot;This church or college consisted of canons,
Augustines or regular priests, and three prebendaries, who enjoyed the
revenues thereof in common, but might not marry; and the lord
chancellor of England of old visited this peculiar--which extended
only over the parishes of Burian, Sennen, and St Levan--for the king.</p>
<P>&quot;One of the Popes of Rome, about the time of Edward
III., obtruded upon this chords, the canons and prebends thereof, a
dean to be an inspector and overseer over them,--whom he nominated to
be the Bishop of Exon for the time being,--who for some time visited
this church as its governor, as the lord chancellor did before; which
encroachment of the Pope being observed by Edward III., as appears
from the register of the writs, folio 40<b> </b>and 41, 8 Edward III.,
rot. 97, this usurpation of the Pope was taken away.&quot;</p>
