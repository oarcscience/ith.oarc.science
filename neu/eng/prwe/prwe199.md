HINGSTON DOWNS.

"Hengsten Down, well ywrought,  
Is worth London town dear ybought."  

CAREW--Lord De Dunstanvlle's Edition.

IT may be worthy of consideration whether we have not evidence in this
distich of the extent to which mining operations were carried on over
this moorland and the adjoining country by the ancient Cornish miners.

It is said that this moorland was originally Hengiston; and tradition
affirms that the name preserves the memory of a severe contest, when the
Welsh joined Egbright, a king of the West Saxons, and defeated the host
of Danes, who had come over to "West Wales," meaning thereby Cornwall.
On this waste Hengist had his fenced camp, and here the Cornish and the
Welsh attacked and entirely overthrew him. It is evident, if tradition
is to be believed, that the struggle was to gain possession of a
valuable tin ground.
