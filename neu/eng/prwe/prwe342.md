THE MERMAID'S VENGEANCE

"INEVITABLE death awaits the wretch who is seduced by their charms. They
seize and drown the swimmer, and entice the child; aitd when they
anticipate that their malevolence will be gratified, they are seen gaily
darting over the surface of the waters."

Since lhis tale has been in type, my attention has been called to an
article on, the "Popular Mythology of the Middle Ages," by Sir F.
Palgrave, in the *Quarterly Review*, No. 44, 1820. The Nixies, to whom
the above quotation especially refers, are in most respects like the
Cornish mermaids.
