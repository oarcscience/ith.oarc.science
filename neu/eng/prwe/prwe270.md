CELTS--FLINT ARROW-HEADS, ETC.

 THE common people believe these to be produced by thunder, and thrown
down from the clouds, and that they show what weather will ensue by
changing their colour.

I have also found a belief prevailing in many districts, that Celts
impart a virtue to water in which they have been soaked, and that
diseases have been cured by drinking it.
