<P ALIGN="CENTER">PADSTOW HOBBY HORSE.</p>
<P>MR. GEORGE RAWLINGS writes, September 1, 1865:-- Formerly
all the respectable people kept the anniversary decorated with the choicest
flowers, but some unlucky day a number of rough characters from a distance
joined it, and committed some sad assaults on old and young--spoiling all
their nice summer clothes, and covering their faces and persons with smut.
From that time--fifty years since--the procession is formed of the lowest.</p>
<P>&#133; The Maypole was once decorated with the best flowers--
now, with only some elm branches and furze in blossom. The horse is formed
as follows :-- The dress is made of sailcloth painted black--a fierce mask--
eyes red--horse's head--horse-hair matte and tail distended by a hoop.
Some would call it very frightful. Carried by a powerful man--they could
inflict much mischief with the <i>snappers</i>, &amp;c. No doubt it is a remnant
of the ancient days, and it represents the Devil, or the power of Darkness.
They commence singing at sunrise. </p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MORNING SONG</p>
<P>Unite
and unite and let us all unite,</p>
<P>For
summer it is come unto day;</p>
<P>And
whither we are going we all will unite</p>
<P>In
the merry morning of May.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>Arise
up, Mr. --, and joy you betide,</p>
<P>For
summer is come unto day;</p>
<P>And
bright is your bride that lays by your side</p>
<P>In
the merry morning of May.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>Arise
up, Mrs. --, and gold be your ring,</p>
<P>For
summer is come unto day;</p>
<P>And
give to us a cup of ale, the merrier we shall sing</p>
<P>In
the merry morning of May.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>Arise
up, Miss --, all in your smock of silk,</p>
<P>For
summer is come unto day;</p>
<P>And
all your body under as white as any milk,</p>
<P>In
the merry morning of May.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>The
young men of Padstow might, if they would, </p>
<P>For
summer is come unto day;</p>
<P>They
might have built a ship and gilded her with gold</p>
<P>In
the merry morning of May.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>Now
fare you well, and we bid you good cheer,</p>
<P>For
summer is come unto day;</p>
<P>We
will come no mote unto your house before another year, </p>
<P>In
the merry morning of May.</p>
<P>
THE DAY SONG</p>
<P>Awake, St. George, our English knight,</p>
<P>For
summer is a' come O, and winter is ago;</p>
<P>And
every day God give us His grace</p>
<P>By
day and by night O!<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>Where is St. George, where is he O?</p>
<P>He is out in his long boat all on the salt sea
O!</p>
<P>And
in every land O! the land where'er we go,</p>
<P>And for to fetch the summer home.
</p>
<P>The summer and the May O,
</p>
<P>For summer is a conic,
</p>
<P>And winter is a go.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
</p>
<P>Where are the French dogs that make such boast O?</p>
<P>They shall eat the grey goose feather,</p>
<P>And
we will cattle roast O !</p>
<P>And in every land O ! the land where'er we go,</p>
<P>The summer and the May O<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
</p>
<P>Thou
mightst have shown thy knavish face!</p>
<P>Thou mightst have tarried at home O !</p>
<P>But
thou shalt be an old cuckold,</p>
<P>And
thou shalt wear the horns O;</p>
<P>The summer and the May
O.</p>
<P>
</p>
<P>ADDITIONAL CHORUS<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
</p>
<P>With
hal-an-tow [a] and jolly rumble O,</p>
<P>For summer is a come O, and winter is a go,</p>
<P>And
in every land O, the land where'er we go,</p>
<P>Up
flies the kite, and down falls the lark O !</p>
<P>Aunt Ursula Birdhood she had an old ewe,</p>
<P>And
she died in her own park O !</p>
<P>And for to fetch the summer home.</p>
