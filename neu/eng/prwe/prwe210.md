HOW TO EAT PILCHARDS.

IT is unlucky to commence eating pilchards, or, indeed, any kind I of
fish, from the head downwards. I have often heard persons rebuked for
committing such a grievous sin, which is "sure to turn the heads of the
fish away from the coasts."

The legitimate process--mark this, all fish-eaters--is *to eat the fish
from the tail towards the head.* This brings the fish to our shores, and
secures good luck to the fishermen.
