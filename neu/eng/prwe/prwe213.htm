<P ALIGN="CENTER">WHIPPING THE HAKE.</p>
<P>IT is not improbable that the saying applied to the
people of one of the Cornish fishing-towns, of&quot; Who whipped the hake ?&quot; may
be explained by the following <i>:--</p>
</i>
<P>&quot;Lastly, they are persecuted by the hakes, who (not long
silence) haunted the coast in great abundance; but now being deprived of
their wonted bait, are much diminished, verifying the proverb, <i>'What we
lose in hake we shall have in herring'.&quot; - Carew, Survey, </i>p. 34.</p>
<P>Annoyed with the hakes, the seiners may, in their
ignorance have actually served one of those fish as indicated.</p>
