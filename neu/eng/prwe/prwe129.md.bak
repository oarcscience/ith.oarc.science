ST DENNIS'S BLOOD.

THE patron saint of the parish church of St Dennis was born in the city
of Athens, in the reign of Tiberius. His name and fame have full record
in the "History of the Saints of the Church of Rome." How his name was
connected with this remote parish is not clearly made out. We learn,
however, that the good man was beheaded at Montmartre, and that he
walked after his execution, with his head under his arm, to the place in
Paris which still bears his name. At the very time when the decapitation
took place in Paris, *blood fell on the stones of this churchyard* in
Cornwall. Previously to the breaking out of the plague in London, the
stains of the blood of St Dennis were again seen; and during our wars
with the Dutch, the defeat of the English fleet was foretold by the rain
of gore in this remote and sequestered place. Hals, the Cornish
historian, with much gravity, informs us that he had seen some of the
stones with blood upon them. Whenever this phenomenon occurs again we
may expect some sad calamity to be near.

Some years since a Cornish gentleman was cruelly murdered and his body
thrown into a brook. I have been very lately shown stones taken from
this brook with bright red spots of some vegetable growth on them. It is
said that ever since the murder the stones in this brook are spotted
with gore, whereas they never were so previously to this dreadful deed.
