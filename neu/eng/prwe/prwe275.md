THE ROBIN AND THE WREN

 "THOSE who kill a robin or a wran,  
Will never prosper, boy or man."

This feeling is deeply impressed on every young mind; there are few,
therefore, who would injure either of those birds.

I remember that a boy in Redruth killed a robin: the dead robin was tied
round his neck, and he was marched by the other boys through the town,
all of them singing the above lines.
