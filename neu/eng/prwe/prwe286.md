ITCHING EARS

 WHEN the ears are red and itch, it is a sign that some one is talking
of the suffering individual. If it is the left ear, they are being
scandalised; if the right ear, they are being praised.

Often have I heard, when the lower and middle class people have been
indulging in some gossip of their neighbours or friends, "I 'II bet how
their ears do itch."
