THE ASH-TREE

 WEAKLY children--"children that wouldn't goode," or thrive - were
sometimes drawn through the cleft ash-tree. I have seen the ceremony
performed but in one case.

The tree was young, and it was taken by the two forks,-- bifurcation
having taken place,--and by force rended longitudinally. The cleft was
kept open, and the child, quite naked, was passed head first through the
tree nine times. The tree was then closed and carefully tied together.
If the severed parts reunited, the child and the tree recovered
together; if the cleft gaped in any part, the operation was certain to
prove ineffectual.

I quote another example. A large knife was inserted into the trunk of
the young tree, about a foot from the ground, and a vertical rending
made for about three feet. Two men then forcibly pulled the parts
asunder, and held them so, whilst the mother passed the child through it
three times. This "passing" alone was not considered effective; it was
necessary that the child should be washed for three successive mornings
in the dew from the leaves of the "charmed ash."

In the *Athenaem for* September 1846, Ambrose Merton - Mr Thom--has some
interesting notices of the wide-spread belief in, and the antiquity of,
this superstition.
