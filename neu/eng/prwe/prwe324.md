THE SPANIARD AT PENRYN

IN the reign of James I. there happened to be upon our coast a Spanish
vessel of war. Favoured by the mists of evening and the growing
darkness, the ship entered Falmouth Harbour unseen. The crew armed
themselves, and taking to their boats, proceeded with great caution to
the town of Penryn, situated at the head of the harbour. There they
landed, formed themselves into proper order, and marched into the town,
purposing to plunder the inhabitants and bum the town. With steady tramp
they cautiously proceeded up the dark main street, resolving to attack
the principal dwellings first. Suddenly a great shout was heard, drums
and trumpets sounded, the noise of many feet rushing to and fro fell on
the ears of the Spaniards. Believing that they were discovered, and that
preparations had been made for their reception, fear seized them, and
they fled precipitately to their boats and left the town. The martial
music proceeded, however, from a temporary theatre, in which a troop of
strolling players were entertaining the people.
