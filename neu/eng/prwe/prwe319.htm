<b>
<P>I. </b>&quot;IN the last age there was a familiarity
between the parson and the clerk and the people which our feelings
of decorum would revolt at <i>-- e.g., </i>'I have seen the ungodly
flourish like a <i>green bay.tree.'</p>
</i>
<P>'How can that be, maister ?' said the clerk of St
Clement's. Of this I was myself an ear-witness.&quot;</p>
<b>
<P>II. </b>&quot;At Kenwyn, two dogs, one of which was the
parson's, were fighting at the west end of the church; time parson, who was
then reading the second lesson, rushed taut of the pew and went down and
parted them; returning to his pew, and doubtful where he had left <i>off,
</i>he asked the clerk, 'Roger, where was I ?' 'Why, down parting the dogs,
maister,' said Roger.&quot;</p>
<b>
<P>III. </b>&quot;At Mevsgizzey, when non-resident clergymen
officiated, it was usual with the squire of the parish to invite them to
dinner. Several years ago, a non-resident clergyman was requested to do duty
in the church of Mevagizzey on a Sunday when the Creed of St Athanaoius is
directed to he read. Before he had begun the service, the parish clerk asked
him whether he intended to read the Athanasian Creed that morning. 'Why?'
said the clergyman. 'Because if you do, no dinner for you at the squire's,
at Penwarne.&quot;</p>
<b>
<P>IV</b>. &quot;A very short time since parish clerks used to
read the first lesson. I once heard the St Agnes clerk cry out, 'To the
mouth of the burning <i>viery vurnis, </i>and spake, and said, Sisadrac,
Meshac, and Abednego, <i>com voath and com hether' </i>(Daniel iii)&quot;</p>
<b>
<P>V. </b>&quot;The clerk of Lamorran, in giving out the psalm.
'Like a timorous bird to distant mountains fly,' always said, 'Like a
timmersumburde,' &amp;c., &amp;c., with a shake of the head, and a quivering voice,
which could not but provoke risibility.&quot;--.<i>Hone's</i> <i>Table-Book.</p>
