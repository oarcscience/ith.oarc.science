<PRE>

291A.1	 LADY ERSKINE sits in her chamber,
	 Sewing at her silken seam,
	 A chain of gold for Childe Owlet,
	 As he goes out and in.
291A.2	 But it fell ance upon a day
	 She unto him did say,
	 Ye must cuckold Lord Ronald,
	 For a&#146; his lands and ley.
291A.3	 &#145;O cease! forbid, madam,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;That this shoud eer be done!
	 How would I cuckold Lord Ronald,
	 And me his sister&#146;s son?&#146;
291A.4	 Then she&#146;s ta&#146;en out a little penknife,
	 That lay below her bed,
	 Put it below her green stay&#146;s cord,
	 Which made her body bleed.
291A.5	 Then in it came him Lord Ronald,
	 Hearing his lady&#146;s moan;
	 &#145;What blood is this, my dear,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;That sparks on the fire-stone?&#146;
291A.6	 ung Childe Owlet, your sister&#146;s son,
	 Is now gane frae my bower;
	 If I hadna been a good woman,
	 I&#146;d been Childe Owlet&#146;s whore.&#146;
291A.7	 Then he has taen him Childe Owlet,
	 Laid him in prison strong,
	 And all his men a council held
	 How they woud work him wrong.
291A.8	 Some said they woud Childe Owlet hang,
	 Some said they woud him burn;
	 Some said they woud have Childe Owlet
	 Bewteen wild horses torn.
291A.9	 ere are horses in your stables stand
	 Can run right speedilie,
	 And ye will to your stable go,
	 And wile out four for me.&#146;
291A.10	 They put a foal to ilka foot,
	 And ane to ilka hand,
	 And sent them down to Darling muir,
	 As fast as they coud gang.
291A.11	 There was not a kow in Darling muir,
	 Nor ae piece o a rind,
	 But drappit o Child Owlet&#146;s blude
	 And pieces o his skin.
291A.12	 There was not a kow in Darling muir,
	 Nor ae piece o a rash,
	 But drappit o Childe Owlet&#146;s blude
	 And pieces o his flesh.
