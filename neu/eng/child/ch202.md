# 202A: The Battle of Philiphaugh


    202A.1   ON Philiphaugh a fray began,
         At Hairheadwood it ended;
         The Scots outoer the Gra+emes they ran,
         Sae merrily they bended.
    202A.2   Sir David frae the Border came,
         Wi heart an hand came he;
         Wi him three thousand bonny Scots,
         To bear him company.
    202A.3   Wi him three thousand valiant men,
         A noble sight to see!
         A cloud o mist them weel conceald,
         As close as eer might be.
    202A.4   When they came to the Shaw burn,
         Said he, Sae weel we frame,
         I think it is convenient
         That we should sing a psalm.
    202A.5   When they came to the Lingly burn,
         As daylight did appear,
         They spyd an aged father,
         And he did draw them near.
    202A.6   Come hither, aged father,
         Sir David he did cry,
         And tell me where Montrose lies,
         With al his great army.
    202A.7   But first you must come tell to me,
         If friends or foes you be;
         I fear you are Montroses men,
         Come frae the north country.
    202A.8   No, we are nane o Montroses men,
         Nor eer intend to be;
         I am Sir David Lesly,
         Thats speaking unto thee.
    202A.9   "[If youre Sir David Lesly,
         As I think weel ye be,
         I am sorry ye hae brought so few
         Into your company.
    202A.10  Theres fifteen thousand armed men
         Encamped on yon lee;
         Yell never be a bite to them,
         For aught that I can see.
    202A.11  But halve your men in equal parts,
         Your purpose to fulfill;
         Let ae half keep the water-side,
         The rest gae round the hill.
    202A.12  Your nether party fire must,
         Then beat a flying drum;
         And then theyll think the days their ain,
         And frae the trench theyll come.
    202A.13  Then, those that are behind them maun
         Gie shot, baith grit and sma;
         And so, between your armies twa,
         Ye may make them to fa.
    202A.14  O were ye ever a soldier?
         Sir David Lesly said;
         O yes; I was at Solway Flow,
         Where we were all betrayd.
    202A.15  Again I was at curst Dunbar,
         And was a prisner taen,
         And many weary night and day
         In prison I hae lien.
    202A.16  If ye will lead these men aright,
         Rewarded shal ye be;
         But, if that ye a traitor prove,
         Ill hang thee on a tree.
    202A.17  Sir, I will not a traitor prove;
         Montrose has plunderd me;
         Ill do my best to banish him
         Away frae this country.
    202A.18  He halvd his men in equal parts,
         His purpose to fulfill;
         The one part kept the water-side,
         The other gaed round the hill.
    202A.19  The nether party fired brisk,
         Then turnd and seemd to rin;
         And then they a came frae the trench,
         And cryd The days our ain!
    202A.20  The rest then ran into the trench,
         And loosd their cannons a:
         And thus, between his armies twa,
         He made them fast to fa.
    202A.21  Now let us a for Lesly pray
         And his brave company,
         For they hae vanquishd great Montrose,
         Our cruel enemy.
