# 265A: The Knight’s Ghost


    265A.1   THERE is a fashion in this land,
         And even come to this country,
         That every lady should meet her lord
         When he is newly come frae sea:
    265A.2   Some wi hawks, and some wi hounds,
         And other some wi gay monie;
         Bit I will gae myself alone,
         And set his young son on his knee.
    265A.3   Shes taen her young son in her arms,
         And nimbly walkd by yon sea-strand,
         And there she spyd her fathers ship,
         As she was sailing to dry land.
    265A.4   Where hae ye put my ain gude lord,
         This day he stays sae far frae me?
         If ye be wanting your ain gude lord,
         A sight o him yell never see.
    265A.5   Was he brunt? or was he shot?
         Or was he drowned in the sea?
         Or whats become o my ain gude lord,
         That he will neer appear to me?
    265A.6   He wasna brunt, nor was he shot,
         Nor was he drowned in the sea;
         He was slain in Dunfermling,
         A fatal day to you and me.
    265A.7   Come in, come in, my merry young men,
         Come in and drink the wine wi me;
         And a the better ye shall fare
         For this gude news ye tell to me.
    265A.8   Shes brought them down to yon cellar,
         She brought them fifty steps and three;
         She birled wi them the beer and wine,
         Till they were as drunk as drunk could be.
    265A.9   Then she has lockd her cellar-door,
         For there were fifty steps and three:
         Lie there, wi my sad malison,
         For this bad news yeve tauld to me.
    265A.10  Shes taen the keys intill her hand
         And threw them deep, deep in the sea:
         Lie there, wi my sad malison,
         Till my gude lord return to me.
    265A.11  Then she sat down in her own room,
         And sorrow lulld her fast asleep,
         And up it starts her own gude lord,
         And even at that ladys feet.
    265A.12  Take here the keys, Janet, he says,
         That ye threw deep, deep in the sea;
         And yell relieve my merry young men,
         For theyve nane o the swick o me.
    265A.13  They shot the shot, and drew the stroke,
         And wad in red bluid to the knee;
         Nae sailors mair for their lord coud do
         Nor my young men they did for me.
    265A.14  I hae a question at you to ask,
         Before that ye depart frae me;
         Youll tell to me what day Ill die,
         And what day will my burial be?
    265A.15  I hae nae mair o Gods power
         Than he has granted unto me;
         But come to heaven when ye will,
         There porter to you I will be.
    265A.16  But yell be wed to a finer knight
         Than ever was in my degree;
         Unto him yell hae children nine,
         And six o them will be ladies free.
    265A.17  The other three will be bold young men,
         To fight for king and countrie;
         The ane a duke, the second a knight,
         And third a laird o lands sae free.
