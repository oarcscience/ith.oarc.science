# 241A: The Baron o Leys


    241A.1   THE Laird of Leys is on to Edinbrugh,
         To shaw a fit o his follie;
         He drest himsel in the crimson-brown,
         An he provd a rantin laddie.
    241A.2   Ben came a weel-faird lass,
         Says, Laddie, how do they ca ye?
         They ca me this, an they ca me that,
         Ye wudna ken fat they ca me;
         But whan Im at home on bonnie Deeside
         They ca me The Rantin Laddie.
    241A.3   They sought her up, they sought her down,
         They sought her in the parlour;
         She couldna be got but whar she was,
         In the bed wi The Rantin Laddie.
    241A.4   Tell me, tell me, Baron of Leys,
         Ye tell me how they ca ye!
         Your gentle blood moves in my side,
         An I dinna ken how they ca ye.
    241A.5   They ca me this, an they ca me that,
         Ye couldna ken how they ca me;
         But whan Im at home on bonnie Deeside
         They ca me The Rantin Laddie.
    241A.6   Tell me, tell me, Baron of Leys,
         Ye tell mo how they ca ye!
         Your gentle blood moves in my side,
         An I dinna ken how to ca ye.
    241A.7   Baron of Leys, it is my stile,
         Alexander Burnett they ca me;
         Whan Im at hame on bonnie Deeside
         My name is The Rantin Laddie.
    241A.8   Gin your name be Alexander Burnett,
         Alas that ever I saw ye!
         For ye hae a wife and bairns at hame,
         An alas for lyin sae near ye!
    241A.9   But Ise gar ye be headit or hangt,
         Or marry me the morn,
         Or else pay down ten thousand crowns
         For giein o me the scorn.
    241A.10  For my head, I canna want;
         I love my lady dearly;
         But some o my lands I maun lose in the case,
         Alas for lyin sae near ye!
    241A.11  Word has gane to the Lady of Leys
         That the laird he had a bairn;
         The warst word she said to that was,
         I wish I had it in my arms.
    241A.12  For I will sell my jointure-lands-+--+-
         I am broken an Im sorry-+--+-
         An Ill sell a, to my silk gowns,
         An get hame my rantin laddie.

### 241B: The Baron o Leys


    241B.1   THE Laird o Leys is to London gane;
         He was baith full and gawdie;
         For he shod his steed wi siller guid,
         And hes playd the ranting laddie.
    241B.2   He hadna been in fair London
         A twalmonth and a quarter,
         Till he met wi a weel-faurd may,
         Wha wishd to know how they cad him.
    241B.3   They ca me this, and they ca me that,
         And theyre easy how theyve cad me;
         But whan Im at hame on bonnie Deeside
         They ca me The Ranting Laddie.
    241B.4   Awa wi your jesting, sir, she said,
         I trow youre a ranting laddie;
         But something swells atween my sides,
         And I maun ken how they ca thee.
    241B.5   They ca me this, and they ca me that,
         And theyre easy how they ca me;
         The Baron o Leys my title is,
         And Sandy Burnet they ca me.
    241B.6   Tell down, tell down ten thousand crowns,
         Or ye maun marry me the morn;
         Or headit of hangit ye sall be,
         For ye sanna gie me the scorn.
    241B.7   My heads the thing I canna weel want;
         My lady she loves me dearlie;
         Nor yet hae I means ye to maintain;
         Alas for the lying sae near thee!
    241B.8   But words gane doun to the Lady o Leys
         That the Baron had got a babie:
         The waurst o news! my lady she said,
         I wish I had hame my laddie.
    241B.9   But Ill sell aff my jointure-house,
         Tho na mair I sud be a ladie;
         Ill sell a to my silken goun,
         And bring hame my rantin laddie.
    241B.10  So she is on to London gane,
         And she paid the money on the morn;
         She paid it doun and brought him hame,
         And gien them a the scorn.

### 241C: The Baron o Leys


    241C.1   THE Baron o Leys to France is gane,

         But hadna been there a month or twa
         Till he gat a lady wi bairn.
    241C.2   But it fell ance upon a day
         The lady mournd fu sairlie;
         Says, Whos the man has me betrayed?
         It gars me wonder and fairlie.
    241C.3   Then to the fields to him she went,
         Saying, Tell me what they ca thee;
         Or else Ill mourn and rue the day,
         Crying, alas that ever I saw thee!
    241C.4   Some cas me this, some cas me that,
         I carena fat befa me;
         For when Im at the schools o France
         An awkward fellow they ca me.
    241C.5   Waes me now, ye awkward fellow,
         And alas that ever I saw thee!
         Wi you Im in love, sick, sick in love,
         And I kenna well fat they ca thee.
    241C.6   Some cas me this, some cas me that,
         What name does best befa me;
         For when I walk in Edinburgh streets
         The Curling Buckle they ca me.
    241C.7   O waes me now, O Curling Buckle,
         And alas that ever I saw thee!
         For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
         And I kenna well fat they ca thee.
    241C.8   Some cas me this, some cas me that,
         Whatever name best befas me;
         But when Im in Scotlands kings high court
         Clatter the Speens they ca me.
    241C.9   O waes me now, O Clatter the Speens,
         And alas that ever I saw thee!
         For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
         And I kenna well fat to ca thee.
    241C.10  Some cas me this, some cas me that,
         I carena what they ca me;
         But when wi the Earl o Murray I ride
         Its Scour the Brass they ca me.
    241C.11  O waes me now, O Scour the Brass,
         And alas that ever I saw thee!
         For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
         Amd I kenna well fat to ca thee.
    241C.12  Some cas me this, some cas me that,
         Whatever name best befas me;
         But when I walk thro Saint Johnstones town
         George Burnett they ca me.
    241C.13  O waes me, O waes me, George Burnett,
         And alas that ever I saw thee!
         For Im in love, sick, sick in love,
         And I kenna well fat to ca thee.
    241C.14  Some cas me this, some cas me that,
         Whatever name best befas me;
         But when I am on bonny Dee side
         The Baron o Leys they ca me.
    241C.15  O weal is me now, O Baron o Leys,
         This day that ever I saw thee!
         Theres gentle blood within my sides,
         And now [I] ken fat they ca thee.
    241C.16  But yell pay down ten thousand crowns,
         Or marry me the morn;
         Else Ill cause you be headed or hangd
         For gieing me the scorn.
    241C.17  My head is a thing I cannot well want;
         My lady loves me sae dearly;
         But Ill deal the gold right liberally
         For lying ae night sae near thee.
    241C.18  When word had gane to the Lady o Leys
         The baron had gotten a bairn,
         She clapped her hands, and this did say,
         I wish he were in my arms!
    241C.19  O weal is me now, O Baron o Leys,
         For ye hae pleased me sairly;
         Frae our house is banishd the vile reproach
         That disturbed us late and early.
    241C.20  When she looked ower her castle-wa,
         To view the woods sae rarely,
         There she spied the Baron o Leys
         Ride on his steed sae rarely.
    241C.21  Then forth she went her baron to meet,
         Says, Yere welcome to me, fairly!
         Yese hae spice-cakes, and seed-cakes sweet,
         And claret to drink sae rarely.
