<PRE>

36.1	&#145;I WAS but seven year auld
	When my mither she did die;
	My father married the ae warst woman
	The warld did ever see.
36.2	&#145;For she has made me the laily worm,
	That lies at the fit o the tree,
	An my sister Masery she&#146;s made
	The machrel of the sea.
36.3	&#145;An every Saturday at noon
	The machrel comes to me,
	An she takes my laily head
	An lays it on her knee,
	She kaims it wi a siller kaim,
	An washes&#146;t in the sea.
36.4	&#145;Seven knights hae I slain,
	Sin I lay at the fit of the tree,
	An ye war na my ain father,
	The eight ane ye should be.&#146;
36.5	&#145;Sing on your song, ye laily worm,
	That ye did sing to me:&#146;
	&#145;I never sung that song but what
	I would it sing to thee.
36.6	&#145;I was but seven year auld,
	When my mither she did die;
	My father married the ae warst woman
	The warld did ever see.
36.7	&#145;For she changed me to the laily worm,
	That lies at the fit o the tree,
	And my sister Masery
	To the machrel of the sea.
36.8	&#145;And every Saturday at noon
	The machrel comes to me,
	An she takes my laily head
	An lays it on her knee,
	An kames it wi a siller kame,
	An washes it i the sea.
36.9	&#145;Seven knights hae I slain,
	Sin I lay at the fit o the tree,
	An ye war na my ain father,
	The eighth ane ye shoud be.&#146;
36.10	He sent for his lady,
	As fast as send could he:
	&#145;Whar is my son that ye sent frae me,
	And my daughter, Lady Masery?&#146;
36.11	&#145;Your son is at our king&#146;s court,
	Serving for meat an fee,
	An your daughter&#146;s at our queen&#146;s court,
	. . . . . &#146;
36.12	&#145;Ye lie, ye ill woman,
	Sae loud as I hear ye lie;
	My son&#146;s the laily worm,
	That lies at the fit o the tree,
	And my daughter, Lady Masery,
	Is the machrel of the sea!&#146;
36.13	She has tane a siller wan,
	An gien him strokes three,
	And he has started up the bravest knight
	That ever your eyes did see.
36.14	She has taen a small horn,
	An loud an shrill blew she,
	An a&#146; the fish came her untill
	But the proud machrel of the sea:
	&#145;Ye shapeit me ance an unseemly shape,
	An ye&#146;s never mare shape me.&#146;
36.15	He has sent to the wood
	For whins and for hawthorn,
	An he has taen that gay lady,
	An there he did her burn.
