<PRE>

46A.1	THE laird of Bristoll&#146;s daughter was in the woods walking,
	And by came Captain Wetherbourn, a servant to the king;
	And he said to his livery man, Wer&#146;t not against the law,
	I would tak her to mine ain bed, and lay her neist the wa.
46A.2	&#145;I&#146;m into my father&#146;s woods, amongst my father&#146;s trees,
	O kind sir, let mee walk alane, O kind sir, if you please;
	The butler&#146;s bell it will be rung, and I&#146;ll be mist awa;
	I&#146;ll lye into mine ain bed, neither at stock nor wa.&#146;
46A.3	&#145;O my bonny lady, the bed it&#146;s not be mine,
	For I&#146;ll command my servants for to call it thine;
	The hangings are silk satin, the sheets are holland sma,
	And we&#146;s baith lye in ae bed, but you&#146;s lye neist the wa.
46A.4	&#145;And so, my bonny lady, -+-I do not know your name,-+-
	But my name&#146;s Captain Wetherburn, and I&#146;m a man of fame;
	Tho your father and a&#146; his men were here, I would na stand in awe
	To tak you to mine ain bed, and lay you neist the wa.
46A.5	&#145;Oh my bonny, bonny lady, if you&#146;ll gie me your hand,
	You shall hae drums and trumpets to sound at your command;
	Wi fifty men to guard you, sae weel their swords can dra,
	And wee&#146;s baith lye in ae bed, but you&#146;s lye neist the wa.&#146;
46A.6	He&#146;s mounted her upon a steid, behind his gentleman,
	And he himself did walk afoot, to had his lady on,
	With his hand about her midle sae jimp, for fear that she should fa;
	She man lye in his bed, but she&#146;ll not lye neist the wa.
46A.7	He&#146;s taen her into Edinburgh, his landlady cam ben:
	&#145;And monny bonny ladys in Edinburgh hae I seen,
	But the like of this fine creature my eyes they never sa;&#146;
	&#145;O dame bring ben a down-bed, for she&#146;s lye neist the wa.&#146;
46A.8	&#145;Hold your tongue, young man,&#146; she said, a+end dinna trouble me,
	Unless you get to my supper, and that is dishes three;
	Dishes three to my supper, tho I eat nane at a&#146;,
	Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
46A.9	&#145;You maun get to my supper a cherry but a stane,
	And you man get to my supper a capon but a bane,
	And you man get a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga,
	Before I lye in your bed, but I&#146;ll not lye neist the wa.&#146;
46A.10	&#145;A cherry whan in blossom is a cherry but a stane;
	A capon when he&#146;s in the egg canna hae a bane;
	The dow it is a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga;
	And ye man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.&#146;
46A.11	&#145;Hold your tongue, young man,&#146; she said, a+end dinna me perplex,
	Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions six;
	Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa,
	Before I lye in your bed, but I&#146;ll not lye neist the wa.
46A.12	&#145;What is greener than the grass, what&#146;s higher than the tree?
	What&#146;s war than a woman&#146;s wiss, what&#146;s deeper than the sea?
	What bird sings first, and whereupon the dew down first does fa?
	Before I lye in your bed, but I&#146;ll lye neist the wa.&#146;
46A.13	&#145;Virgus is greener than the grass, heaven&#146;s higher than the tree;
	The deil&#146;s war than a woman&#146;s wish, hell&#146;s deeper than the sea;
	The cock sings first, on the Sugar Loaf the dew down first does fa;
	And ye man lye in my bed, betweest me and the wa.&#146;
46A.14	&#145;Hold your tongue, young man,&#146; she said, &#145;I pray you give it oer,
	Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions four;
	Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa,
	Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
46A.15	&#145;You man get to me a plumb that does in winter grow;
	And likewise a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro;
	A sparrow&#146;s horn, a priest unborn, this night to join us twa,
	Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.&#146;
46A.16	&#145;There is a plumb in my father&#146;s yeard that does in winter grow;
	Likewise he has a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro;
	A sparrow&#146;s horn, it may be found, there&#146;s ane in every tae,
	There&#146;s ane upo the mouth of him, perhaps there may be twa.
46A.17	&#145;The priest is standing at the door, just ready to come in;
	Nae man could sae that he was born, to lie it is a sin;
	For a wild boar bored him mother&#146;s side, he out of it did fa;
	And you man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.&#146;
46A.18	Little kent Grizey Sinclair, that morning when she raise,
	&#146;Twas to be the hindermost of a&#146; her single days;
	For now she&#146;s Captain Wetherburn&#146;s wife, a man she never saw,
	And she man lye in his bed, but she&#146;ll not lye neist the wa.

46B.2	&#145;I&#146;m walking here my lane,&#146; she says, &#145;amang my father&#146;s trees;

46B.5	&#145;O my name is Captain Wedderburn, my name I&#146;ll neer deny,
	And I command ten thousand men, upo yon mountains high.
	Tho your father and his men were here, of them I&#146;d stand na awe,
	But should tak ye to my ain bed, and lay ye neist the wa.&#146;
46B.6	Then he lap aff his milk-white steed, and set the lady on,
	And a&#146; the way he walkd on foot, he held her by the hand;
	He held her by the middle jimp, for fear that she should fa;
	Saying, I&#146;ll tak ye to my ain bed, and lay thee at the wa.
46B.7	He took her to his quartering-house, his landlady looked ben,
	Saying, Monie a pretty ladie in Edinbruch I&#146;ve seen;
	But sic &#146;na pretty ladie is not into it a&#146;:
	Gae, mak for her a fine down-bed, and lay her at the wa.

46B.10	&#145;Whan the chicken&#146;s in the shell, I am sure it has na bane;
	And whan the cherry&#146;s in the bloom, I wat it has na stane;
	The dove she is a genty bird, she flees without a gaw;
	Sae we&#146;ll baith lie in ae bed, and ye&#146;ll be at the wa.&#146;
46B.11	&#145;O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye give me owre,

	And twa upo the gab o it, and ye shall get them a.
46B.14	&#145;The priest he stands without the yett, just ready to come in;
	Nae man can say he eer was born, nae man without he sin;

46C.1	THE laird of Roslin&#146;s daughter walked thro the wood her lane,
	And by came Captain Wedderburn, a servant to the Queen;
	He said unto his serving man, Wer&#146;t not agaynst the law,
	I would tak her to my ain house as lady o my ha.
46C.2	He said, My pretty ladye, I pray give me your hand;
	You shall have drums and trumpets always at your command;
	With fifty men to guard you, that well their swords can draw,
	And I&#146;ll tak ye to my ain bed, and lay you next the wa.
46C.3	&#145;I&#146;m walking in my feyther&#146;s shaws:&#146; quo he, My charming maid,
	I am much better than I look, so be you not afraid;
	For I serve the queen of a&#146; Scotland, and a gentil dame is she;
	So we&#146;se be married ere the morn, gin ye can fancy me.
46C.4	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
	&#145;The sparrow shall toot on his horn, gif naething us befa,
	And I&#146;ll mak you up a down-bed, and lay you next the wa.
46C.5	&#145;Now hold away from me, kind sir, I pray you let me be;
	I wont be lady of your ha till you answer questions three;
	Questions three you must answer me, and that is one and twa,
	Before I gae to Woodland&#146;s house, and be lady o your ha.
46C.6	&#145;You must get me to my supper a chicken without a bone;
	You must get me to my supper a cherry without a stone;
	You must get me to my supper a bird without a ga,
	Before I go to Woodland&#146;s house and be lady of your ha.&#146;
46C.7	&#145;When the cherry is in the bloom, I&#146;m sure it has no stone;
	When the chicken&#146;s in the shell, I&#146;m sure it has nae bone;
	The dove she is a gentil bird, and flies without a ga;
	So I&#146;ve answered you your questions three, and you&#146;re lady of my ha.&#146;
	* * * * *
46C.8	&#145;Questions three you must answer me: What&#146;s higher than the trees?
	And what is worse than woman&#146;s voice? What&#146;s deeper than the seas?&#146;
	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
46C.9	He answered then so readily: Heaven&#146;s higher than the trees;
	The devil&#146;s worse than woman&#146;s voice; hell&#146;s deeper than the seas;
	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
46C.10	&#145;One question still you must answer me, or you I laugh to scorn;
	Go seek me out an English priest, of woman never born;&#146;
	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
46C.11	&#145;Oh then,&#146; quo he, &#146;My young brother from mother&#146;s side was torn,
	And he&#146;s a gentil English priest, of woman never born;&#146;
	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
46C.12	Little did his lady think, that morning when she raise,
	It was to be the very last of all her mayden days;
