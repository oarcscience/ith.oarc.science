# 249A: Auld Matrons


    249A.1   MY love she is a gentlewoman,
         Has her living by the seam;
         I kenna how she is provided
         This night for me and my foot-groom.
    249A.2   He is gane to Annies bower-door,
         And gently tirled at the pin:
         Ye sleep, ye wake, my love Annie,
         Yell rise and lat your true-love in.
    249A.3   Wi her white fingers lang and sma
         She gently lifted up the pin;
         Wi her arms lang and bent
         She kindly caught sweet Willie in.
    249A.4   O will ye go to cards or dice?
         Or will ye go to play?
         Or will ye go to a well made bed,
         And sleep a while till day?
    249A.5   I winna gang to cards nor dice,
         Nor yet will I to play;
         But I will gang to a well made bed,
         And sleep a while till day.
    249A.6   My love Annie, my dear Annie,
         I would be at your desire;
         But wae mat fa the auld Matrons,
         As she sits by the kitchen fire!
    249A.7   Keep up your heart, Willie, she said,
         Keep up your heart, dinna fear;
         Its seven years, and some guid mair,
         Sin her foot did file the flear.
    249A.8   They hadna kissd nor love clapped,
         As lovers when they meet,
         Till up it raise the auld Matrons,
         Sae wells she spread her feet.
    249A.9   O wae mat fa the auld Matrons,
         Sae clevers she took the gate!
         And shes gaen ower yon lang, lang hill,
         Knockd at the sheriffs yate.
    249A.10  Ye sleep, ye wake, my lord? she said;
         Are ye not your bower within?
         Theres knight in bed wi your daughter,
         I fear shes gotten wrang.
    249A.11  Yell do ye down thro Kelso town,
         Waken my wall-wight men;
         And gin ye hae your wark well dune
         Ill be there at command.
    249A.12  Shes done her down thro Kelso town,
         Wakend his wall-wight men;
         But gin she had her wark well done
         He was there at command.
    249A.13  He had his horse wi corn fodderd,
         His men armd in mail;
         He gae the Matrons half a merk
         To show them ower the hill.
    249A.14  Willie sleepd, but Annie waked
         Till she heard their bridles ring;
         Then tapped on her loves shoulder,
         And said, Yeve sleepit lang.
    249A.15  O save me, save me, my blessd lady,
         Till Ive on my shooting-gear;
         I dinna fear the king himsell,
         Tho he ans men were here.
    249A.16  Then they shot in, and Willie out,
         The arrows grazd his brow;
         The maid she wept and tore her hair,
         Says, This can never do.
    249A.17  Then they shot in, and he shot out,
         The bow brunt Willies hand;
         But aye he kissd her ruby lips,
         Said, My dear, thinkna lang.
    249A.18  He set his horn to his mouth,
         And has blawn loud and shrill,
         And hes calld on his brother John,
         In Ringlewood he lay still.
    249A.19  The first an shot that Lord John shot,
         He wound fifty and fifteen;
         The next an shot that Lord John shot,
         He cad out the sheriffs een.
    249A.20  O some o you lend me an arm,
         Some o you lend me twa;
         And they that came for strife this day,
         Take horse, ride fast awa.
    249A.21  But wae mat fa yon, auld Matrons,
         An ill death mat ye die!
         Ill burn you on yon high hill-head,
         Blaw your ashes in the sea.
