214A.1	 &#145;I dreamed a dreary dream this night,
	 That fills my heart wi sorrow;
	 I dreamed I was pouing the heather green
	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.
214A.2	 &#145;O true-love mine, stay still and dine,
	 As ye ha done before, O;&#146;
	 &#145;O I&#146;ll be hame by hours nine,
	 And frae the braes of Yarrow.&#146;
214A.3	 I dreamed a dreary dream this night,
	 That fills my heart wi sorrow;
	 I dreamed my luve came headless hame,
	 O frae the braes of Yarrow!
214A.4	 &#145;O true-luve mine, stay still and dine,
	 As ye ha done before, O;&#146;
	 &#145;O I&#146;ll be hame by hours nine,
	 And frae the braes of Yarrow.&#146;
214A.5	 &#145;O are ye going to hawke,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;As ye ha done before, O?
	 Or are ye going to weild your brand,
	 Upon the braes of Yarrow?&#146;
214A.6	 &#145;O I am not going to hawke,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;As I have done before, O,
	 But for to meet your brother Jhon,
	 Upon the braes of Yarrow,
214A.7	 As he gade down yon dowy den,
	 Sorrow went him before, O;
	 Nine well-wight men lay waiting him,
	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.
214A.8	 &#145;I have your sister to my wife,
	 &#145;Ye&#146; think me an unmeet marrow;
	 But yet one foot will I never flee
	 Now frae the braes of Yarrow.&#146;

	 And wi a rappier pierced his heart,
	 And laid him low on Yarrow.

	 Wi meikle dule and sorrow:
	 &#145;Gae to your luve, sister,&#146; he says,

214A.12	 As she went down yon dowy den,
	 Sorrow went her before, O;
	 She saw her true-love lying slain
	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.
214A.13	 &#145;She swoond thrice upon his breist
	 That was her dearest marrow;
	 Said, Ever alace and wae the day
	 Thou wentst frae me to Yarrow!&#146;
214A.14	 She kist his mouth, she kaimed his hair,
	 As she had done before, O ;
	 She &#146;wiped&#146; the blood that trickled doun
	 Upon the braes of Yarrow.

214C.1	 THERE were three lords birling at the wine
	 On the dowie downs o Yarrow;
	 They made a compact them between
	 They would go fight tomorrow.
214C.2	 &#145;Thou took our sister to be thy bride,
	 And thou neer thocht her thy marrow;
	 Thou stealed her frae her daddie&#146;s back,
	 When she was the rose o Yarrow.&#146;
214C.3	 &#145;Yes, I took thy sister to be my bride,
	 And I made her my marrow;
	 I stealed her frae her daddie&#146;s back,
	 And she&#146;s still the rose o Yarrow.&#146;
214C.4	 He is hame to his lady gane,
	 As he had done before! O;
	 Says, Madam. I must go and fight
	 On the dowie downs o Yarrow.
214C.5	 &#145;Stay at hame, my lord,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;For that will cause much sorrow;
	 For my brethren three they will slay thee,
	 On the dowie downs o Yarrow.&#146;
214C.6	 &#145;Hold your tongue, my lady fair,
	 For what needs a&#146; this sorrow?
	 For I&#146;ll be hame gin the clock strikes nine,
	 From the dowie downs o Yarrow.&#146;
214C.7	 She wush his face, she kamed his hair,
	 As she had dune before, O;
	 She dressed him up in his armour clear,
	 Sent him furth to fight on Yarrow.
214C.8	 &#145;Come you here to hawk or hound,
	 Or drink the wine that&#146;s so clear, O?
	 Or come you here to eat in your words,
	 That you&#146;re not the rose o Yarrow?&#146;
214C.9	 &#145;I came not here to hawk or hound,
	 Nor to drink the wine that&#146;s so clear, O;
	 Nor I came not here to eat in my words,
	 For I&#146;m still the rose o Yarrow.&#146;
214C.10	 Then they a&#146; begoud to fight,
	 I wad they focht richt sore, O,
	 Till a cowardly man came behind his back,
	 And pierced his body thorough.
214C.11	 &#145;Gae hame, gae hame, it&#146;s my man John,
	 As ye have done before, O,
	 And tell it to my gay lady
	 That I soundly sleep on Yarrow.&#146;

	 As he had dune before, O,
	 And told it to his gay lady,
	 That  he soundly slept on Yarrow.
214C.13	 &#145;I dreamd a dream now since the streen,
	 God keep us a&#146; frae sorrow!
	 That my lord and I was pu&#146;ing the heather green
	 From the dowie downs o Yarrow.&#146;
214C.14	 Sometimes she rade, sometimes she gaed,
	 As she had dune before, O,
	 And aye between she fell in a soune,
	 Lang or she cam to Yarrow.
214C.15	 Her hair it was five quarters lang,
	 &#146;Twas like the gold for yellow;
	 She twisted it round his milk-white hand,
	 And she&#146;s drawn him hame from Yarrow.
214C.16	 Out and spak her father dear,
	 Says, What needs a&#146; this sorrow?
	 For I&#146;ll get you a far better lord
	 Than ever died on Yarrow.
214C.17	 &#145;O hold your tongue, father,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;For ye&#146;ve bred a&#146; my sorrow;
	 For that rose&#146;ll neer spring sae sweet in May
	 As that rose I lost on Yarrow.&#146;

	 And I wot it was wi sorrow,
	 And she&#146;s gane up yon high, high hill,
	 Down the dowy deans of Yarrow.
214D.12	 Her hair it was five quarters lang,
	 The colour of it was yellow;

	 And she as carried him frae Yarrow.

214J.1	 IN Thoro town there lives a maid,

	 For she has forsaken both lords and knights,
	 And loved a servant-lad in Galla.
214J.2	 Evening and morning her page he ran,
	 Her page he ran wi sorrow,
	 With letters bound, just frae the town,
	 To the servant-lad in Galla.
214J.3	 Her father he got word of that,
	 And he&#146;s bred all her sorrow;
	 He sent him forth to fight wi nine,

	 Wi a thrusty rapier by his side,

214J.5	 She&#146;s taen fareweel of him that day,

	 I dreamd I was pouing the heather green
	 Wi my true love in Yarrow.&#146;
214J.12	 &#145;O I will read your dream, daughter,

	 And aye she sighd, and said, Alass!
	 For my love I had him chosen.
214J.16	 His hair it was three quarters long,
	 Three quarters long and yellow;
	 And she&#146;s rapt it round her middle small,
	 And brought it home to Thorro.
214J.17	 &#145;O hold your tongue, my daughter dear,
	 And talk no more of sorrow;
	 I&#146;ll soon wed you on a better match

	 And she refused nine noble men
	 For a servan lad in Gala.
214L.2	 Her father said that he should fight
	 The nine lords all to-morrow,
	 And he that should the victor be
	 Would get the Rose of Yarrow.
214L.3	 Quoth he, You&#146;re nine, an I&#146;m but ane,
	 And in that there&#146;s no much marrow;
	 Yet I shall fecht ye, man for man,
	 In the dowie dens o Yarrow.
214L.4	 She kissed his lips, and combed his hair,

	 And pierced his heart most foully.
214[Q.7]	&#145;Go home, go home, thou false young man,
	 And tell thy sister Sarah
	 That her true-love John lies dead and gone
	 On the dowie dens of Yarrow.&#146;
214[Q.8]	&#145;O father dear, I dreamed a dream,
	 I&#146;m afraid it will bring sorrow;
	 I dreamed I was pulling the heather-bell
	 In the dowie dens of Yarrow.&#146;
214[Q.9]	&#145;O daughter dear, I read your dream,
	 I doubt it will prove sorrow;
	 For your true-love John lies dead and gone
	 On the dowie dens of Yarrow.&#146;
214[Q.10]	As she walked up yon high, high hill,
	 And down by the holmes of Yarrow,
	 There she saw her true-love John,
	 Lying pale and dead on Yarrow.
214[Q.11]	Her hair it being three quarters long--
	 The colour it was yellow-+-
	 She wrapped it round his middle sma,
	 And carried him hame to Yarrow.
214[Q.12]	&#145;O father dear, you&#146;ve seven sons,
	 You may wed them a&#146; tomorrow,
	 But a fairer flower I never saw
	 Than the lad I loved in Yarrow.&#146;
214[Q.13]	The fair maid being great with child,
	 It filled her heart with sorrow;
	 She died within her lover&#146;s arms,
	 Between that day and morrow.

214[R].1	There were three lords drinking at the wine
	 In the Leader Haughs of Yarrow:
	 &#145;Shall we go play at cards and dice,
	 As we have done before, O?
	 Or shall we go play at the single sword,
	 In the Leader Haughs of Yarrow?&#146;
	 * * * * * * *
214[R.2]	Three he wounded, and five he slew,
	 As he had [done] before, O,
	 But an English lord lap from a bush,
	 And he proved all the sorrow;
	 He had a spear three quarters long,
	 And her thrust his body thorogh.
	 * * * * * * *
214[R.3]	&#145;I dreamed . . . .
	 I wis it prove nae sorrow!
	 I dreamed I was puing the apples green
	 In the dowie howms o Yarrow.&#146;
214[R.4]	&#145;O sister, sister, I&#146;ll read your dream,
	 And I&#146;ll read it in sorrow;
	 Ye may gae bring hame your ain true-love,
	 For he&#146;s sleepin sound in Yarrow.&#146;
214[R.5]	She sought him east, she sought him west,
	 She sought him all the forest thorogh;
	 She found him asleep at the middle yett,
	 In the dowie howms o Yarrow.
214[R.6]	Her hair it was three quarters lang,
	 And the colour of it was yellow;
	 She&#146;s bound it round his middle waist,
	 And borne him hame from Yarrow.

	 An tell your sister sorrow,
	 That her true-love John lies dead and gone
	 In the dowie dens o Yarrow.&#146;

	 Should you wed them a&#146; to-morrow,
	 A fairer flower never grew in June

	 To the ploughman lad of Yarrow,
	 She fell into her father&#146;s arms
	 An died wi grief on Yarrow.
