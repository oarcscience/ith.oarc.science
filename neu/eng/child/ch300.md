# 300A: Blancheflour and Jellyflorice


    300A.1   THERE was a maid, richly arrayd,
         In robes were rare to see,
         For seven years and something mair
         She servd a gay ladie.
    300A.2   But being fond o a higher place,
         In service she thought lang;
         She took her mantle her about,
         Her coffer by the band.
    300A.3   And as she walkd by the shore-side,
         As blythes a bird on tree,
         Yet still she gazd her round about,
         To see what she could see.
    300A.4   At last she spied a little castle,
         That stood near by the sea;
         She spied it far and drew it near,
         To that castle went she.
    300A.5   And when she came to that castle
         She tirled at the pin,
         And ready stood a little wee boy
         To lat this fair maid in.
    300A.6   O whos the owner of this place,
         O porter-boy, tell me;
         This place belongs unto a queen
         O birth and high degree.
    300A.7   She put her hand in her pocket,
         And gae him shillings three:
         O porter, bear my message well
         Unto the queen frae me.
    300A.8   The porters gane before the queen,
         Fell low down on his knee:
         Win up, win up, my porter-boy,
         What makes this courtesie?
    300A.9   I hae been porter at your yetts,
         My dame, these years full three,
         But see a ladie at your yetts
         The fairest my eyes did see.
    300A.10  Cast up my yetts baith wide and braid,
         Lat her come in to me,
         And Ill know by her courtesie
         Lords daughter if she be.
    300A.11  When she came in before the queen,
         Fell low down on her knee:
         Service frae you, my dame the queen,
         I pray you grant it me.
    300A.12  If that service ye now do want,
         What station will ye be?
         Can ye card wool, or spin, fair maid,
         Or milk the cows to me?
    300A.13  No, I can neither card nor spin,
         Nor cows I canno milk,
         But sit into a ladys bower
         And sew the seams o silk.
    300A.14  What is your name, ye comely dame?
         Pray tell this unto me:
         O Blancheflour, that is my name,
         Born in a strange countrie.
    300A.15  O keep ye well frae Jellyflorice-+--+-
         My ain dear son is he-+--+-
         When other ladies get a gift,
         O that ye shall get three.
    300A.16  It wasna tald into the bower
         Till it went thro the ha,
         That Jellyflorice and Blancheflour
         Were grown ower great witha.
    300A.17  When the queens maids their visits paid,
         Upo the gude Yule-day,
         When other ladies got horse to ride,
         She boud take foot and gae.
    300A.18  The queen she calld her stable-groom,
         To come to her right seen;
         Says, Yell take out yon wild waith steed
         And bring him to the green.
    300A.19  Yell take the bridle frae his head,
         The lighters frae his een;
         Ere she ride three times roun the cross,
         Her weel-days will be dune.
    300A.20  Jellyflorice his true-love spyd
         As she rade roun the cross,
         And thrice he kissd her lovely lips,
         And took her frae her horse.
    300A.21  Gang to your bower, my lily-flower,
         For a my mothers spite;
         Theres nae other amang her maids,
         In whom I take delight.
    300A.22  Ye are my jewel, and only ane,
         Nane s do you injury;
         For ere this-day-month come and gang
         My wedded wife yese be.
