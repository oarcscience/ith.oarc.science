# 247A: Lady Elspat


    247A.1   HOW brents your brow, my Lady Elspat!
         How golden yallow is your hair!
         Of all the maids of fair Scotland,
         Theres nane like Lady Elspat fair.
    247A.2   Perform your vows, Sweet William, she says,
         The vows which ye ha made to me,
         An at the back o my mothers castle
         This night Ill surely meet wi thee.
    247A.3   But wae be to her brothers page,
         Who heard the words this twa did say!
         Hes told them to her lady mother,
         Who wrought Sweet William mieckle wae.
    247A.4   For she has taen him Sweet William,
         An shes gard bind him wi his bow-string
         Till the red bluide o his fair body
         Frae ilka nail o his hand did spring.
    247A.5   O it fell once upon a time
         That the Lord Justice came to town;
         Out has she taen him Sweet William,
         Brought him before Lord Justice boun.
    247A.6   An what is the crime, now, madame, he says,
         Has been committed by this young man?
         O he has broken my bonny castel,
         That was well biggit with lime and stane.
    247A.7   An he has broken my bonny coffers,
         That was well banded wi aiken ban,
         An he has stoln my rich jewels;
         I wot he has them every one.
    247A.8   Then out it spake her Lady Elspat,
         As she sat by Lord Justice knee;
         Now ye hae taul your tale, mother,
         I pray, Lord Justice, youl now hear me.
    247A.9   He has na broken her bonny castel,
         That was well biggit wi lime and stane,
         Nor has he stoln her rich jewels,
         For I wot she has them every one.
    247A.10  But tho he was my first true love,
         An tho I had sworn to be his bride,
         Cause he had not a great estate,
         She would this way our loves divide.
    247A.11  An out it spake the Lord Justice,
         I wot the tear was in his ee;
         I see nae fault in this young man,
         Sae loose his bans, an set him free.
    247A.12  Take back your love, Lady Elspat,
         An my best blessing you baith upon!
         For gin he be your first true love,
         He is my eldest sisters son.
    247A.13  There is a steed in my stable
         Cost me baith gold and white money;
         Yes get as mieckle o my free lan
         As hell ride about in a summers day.
