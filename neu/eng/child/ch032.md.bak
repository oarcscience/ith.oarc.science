# 32: King Henry


    32.1    LAT never a man a wooing wend
        That lacketh thingis three;
        A routh o gold, an open heart,
        Ay fu o charity.
    32.2    As this I speak of King Henry,
        For he lay burd-alone;
        An hes doen him to a jelly hunts ha,
        Was seven miles frae a town.
    32.3    He chasd the deer now him before,
        An the roe down by the den,
        Till the fattest buch in a the flock
        King Henry he has slain.
    32.4    O he has doen him to his ha,
        To make him beerly cheer;
        An in it came a griesly ghost,
        Steed stappin i the fleer.
    32.5    Her head hat the reef-tree o the house,
        Her middle ye mot wel span;
        Hes thrown to her his gay mantle,
        Says, Lady, hap your lingcan.
    32.6    Her teeth was a like teather stakes,
        Her nose like club or mell;
        An I ken naething she peard to be,
        But the fiend that wons in hell.
    32.7    Some meat, some meat, ye King Henry,
        Some meat ye gie to me!
        An what meats in this house, lady,
        An what ha I to gie?
        O ye do kill your berry-brown steed,
        An you bring him here to me.
    32.8    O whan he slew his berry-brown steed,
        Wow but his heart was sair!
        Shee eat him [a] up, skin an bane,
        Left naething but hide an hair.
    32.9    Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry,
        Mair meat ye gi to me!
        An what meats in this house, lady,
        An what ha I to gi?
        O ye do kill your good gray-hounds,
        An ye bring them a to me.
    32.10   O whan he slew his good gray-hounds,
        Wow but his heart was sair!
        She eat them a up, skin an bane,
        Left naething but hide an hair.
    32.11   Mair meat, mair meat, ye King Henry,
        Mair meat ye gi to me!
        An what meats i this house, lady,
        An what ha I to gi?
        O ye do kill your gay gos-hawks,
        An ye bring them here to me.
    32.12   O whan he slew his gay gos-hawks,
        Wow but his heart was sair!
        She eat them a up, skin an bane,
        Left naething but feathers bare.
    32.13   Some drink, some drink, now, King Henry,
        Some drink ye bring to me!
        O what drinks i this house, lady,
        That youre nae welcome ti?
        O ye sew up your horses hide,
        An bring in a drink to me.
    32.14   And hes sewd up the bloody hide,
        A puncheon o wine put in;
        She drank it a up at a waught,
        Left na ae drap ahin.
    32.15   A bed, a bed, now, King Henry,
        A bed you mak to me!
        For ye maun pu the heather green,
        An mak a bed to me.
    32.16   O pud has he the heather green,
        An made to her a bed,
        An up has he taen his gay mantle,
        An oer it has he spread.
    32.17   Tak aff your claiths, now, King Henry,
        An lye down by my side!
        O God forbid, says King Henry,
        That ever the like betide;
        That ever the fiend that wons in hell
        Shoud streak down by my side.
        * * * * *
    32.18   Whan night was gane, and day was come,
        An the sun shone throw the ha,
        The fairest lady that ever was seen
        Lay atween him an the wa.
    32.19   O well is me! says King Henry,
        How langll this last wi me?
        Then out it spake that fair lady,
        Even till the day you dee.
    32.20   For Ive met wi mony a gentle knight
        Thats gien me sic a fill,
        But never before wi a courteous knight
        That ga me a my will.
