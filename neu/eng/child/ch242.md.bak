# 242A: The Coble o Cargin


    242A.1   DAVID DRUMMONDRRrrS destinie,
         Gude man o appearance o Cargill;
         I wat his blude rins in the flude,
         Sae sair against his parents will.
    242A.2   She was the lass o Balathy toun,
         And he the butler o Stobhall,
         And mony a time she wauked late
         To bore the coble o Cargill.
    242A.3   His bed was made in Kercock ha,
         Of gude clean sheets and of [the] hay;
         He wudna rest ae nicht therein,
         But on the prude waters he wud gae.
    242A.4   His bed was made in Balathy toun,
         Of the clean sheets and of the strae;
         But I wat it was far better made
         Into the bottom o bonnie Tay.
    242A.5   She bored the coble in seven pairts,
         I wat her heart might hae been fu sair;
         For there she got the bonnie lad lost
         Wi the curly locks and the yellow hair.
    242A.6   He put his foot into the boat,
         He little thocht o ony ill;
         But before that he was mid-waters,
         The weary coble began to fill.
    242A.7   Woe be to the lass o Balathy toun,
         I wat an ill death may she die!
         For she bored the coble in seven pairts,
         And let the waters perish me.
    242A.8   Oh, help, oh help, I can get nane,
         Nae help o man can to me come!
         This was about his dying words,
         When he was choaked up to the chin.
    242A.9   Gae tell my father and my mother
         It was naebody did me this ill;
         I was a-going my ain errands,
         Lost at the coble o bonnie Cargill.
    242A.10  She bored the boat in seven pairts,
         I wat she bored it wi gude will;
         And there they got the bonnie lads corpse,
         In the kirk-shot o bonnie Cargill.
    242A.11  Oh a the keys o bonnie Stobha
         I wat they at his belt did hing;
         But a the keys of bonnie Stobha
         They now ly low into the stream.
    242A.12  A braver page into his age
         Neer set a foot upon the plain;
         His father to his mother said,
         Oh, sae soon as weve wanted him!
    242A.13  I wat they had mair luve than this
         When they were young and at the scule;
         But for his sake she wauked late,
         And bored the coble o bonnie Cargill.
    242A.14  Theres neer a clean sark gae on my back,
         Nor yet a kame gae in my hair;
         Theres neither coal nor candle-licht
         Shall shine in my bouir foe evir mair.
    242A.15  At kirk nor market Ise neer be at,
         Nor yet a blythe blink in my ee;
         Theres neer a ane shall say to anither,
         Thats the lassie gard the young man die.
    242A.16  Between the yates o bonnie Stobha
         And the kirk-style o bonnie Cargill,
         There is mony a man and mothers son
         That was at my loves burial.
