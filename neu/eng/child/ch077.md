# 77A: Sweet William’s Ghost


    77A.1   THERE came a ghost to Margrets door,
        With many a grievous groan,
        And ay he tirled at the pin,
        But answer made she none.
    77A.2   Is that my father Philip,
        Or ist my brother John?
        Or ist my true-love, Willy,
        From Scotland new come home?
    77A.3   Tis not thy father Philip,
        Nor yet thy brother John;
        But tis thy true-love, Willy,
        From Scotland new come home.
    77A.4   O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,
        I pray thee speak to me;
        Give me my faith and troth, Margret,
        As I gave it to thee.
    77A.5   Thy faith and troth thous never get,
        Nor yet will I thee lend,
        Till that thou come within my bower,
        And kiss my cheek and chin.
    77A.6   If I shoud come within thy bower,
        I am no earthly man;
        And shoud I kiss thy rosy lips,
        Thy days will not be lang.
    77A.7   O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,
        I pray thee speak to me;
        Give me my faith and troth, Margret,
        As I gave it to thee.
    77A.8   Thy faith and troth thous never get,
        Nor yet will I thee lend,
        Till you take me to yon kirk,
        And wed me with a ring.
    77A.9   My bones are buried in yon kirk-yard,
        Afar beyond the sea,
        And it is but my spirit, Margret,
        Thats now speaking to thee.
    77A.10  She stretchd out her lilly-white hand,
        And, for to do her best,
        Hae, theres your faith and troth, Willy,
        God send your soul good rest.
    77A.11  Now she has kilted her robes of green
        A piece below her knee,
        And a the live-lang winter night
        The dead corp followed she.
    77A.12  Is there any room at your head, Willy?
        Or any room at your feet?
        Or any room at your side, Willy,
        Wherein that I may creep?
    77A.13  Theres no room at my head, Margret,
        Theres no room at my feet;
        Theres no room at my side, Margret,
        My coffins made so meet.
    77A.14  Then up and crew the red, red cock,
        And up then crew the gray:
        Tis time, tis time, my dear Margret,
        That you were going away.
    77A.15  No more the ghost to Margret said,
        But, with a grievous groan,
        Evanishd in a cloud of mist,
        And left her all alone.
    77A.16  O stay, my only true-love, stay,
        The constant Margret cryd;
        Wan grew her cheeks, she closd her een,
        Stretchd her soft limbs, and dyd.

    77B.1   WHAN bells war rung, an mass was sung,
        A wat a man to bed were gone,
        Clark Sanders came to Margrets window,
        With mony a sad sigh and groan.
    77B.2   Are ye sleeping, Margret, he says,
        Or are ye waking, presentlie?
        Give me my faith and trouthe again,
        A wat, trew-love, I gied to thee.
    77B.3   Your faith and trouth yes never get,
        Nor our trew love shall never twain,
        Till ye come with me in my bower,
        And kiss me both cheek and chin.
    77B.4   My mouth it is full cold, Margret,
        It has the smell now of the ground;
        And if I kiss thy comely mouth,
        Thy life-days will not be long.
    77B.5   Cocks are crowing a merry mid-larf,
        I wat the wild fule boded day;
        Gie me my faith and trouthe again,
        And let me fare me on my way.
    77B.6   Thy faith and trouth thou shall na get,
        Nor our trew love shall never twin,
        Till ye tell me what comes of women
        Awat that dys in strong traveling.
    77B.7   Their beds are made in the heavens high,
        Down at the foot of our good Lords knee,
        Well set about wi gilly-flowers,
        A wat sweet company for to see.
    77B.8   O cocks are crowing a merry midd-larf,
        A wat the wilde foule boded day;
        The salms of Heaven will be sung,
        And ere now Ile be misst away.
    77B.9   Up she has tain a bright long wand,
        And she has straked her trouth thereon;
        She has given [it] him out at the shot-window,
        Wi many a sad sigh and heavy groan.
    77B.10  I thank you, Margret, I thank you, Margret,
        And I thank you hartilie;
        Gine ever the dead come for the quick,
        Be sure, Margret, Ill come again for thee.
    77B.11  Its hose an shoon an gound alane
        She clame the wall and followed him,
        Untill she came to a green forest,
        On this she lost the sight of him.
    77B.12  Is their any room at your head, Sanders?
        Is their any room at your feet?
        Or any room at your twa sides?
        Whare fain, fain woud I sleep.
    77B.13  Their is na room at my head, Margret,
        Their is na room at my feet;
        There is room at my twa sides,
        For ladys for to sleep.
    77B.14  Cold meal is my covering owre,
        But an my winding sheet;
        My bed it is full low, I say,
        Down among the hongerey worms I sleep.
    77B.15  Cold meal is my covering owre,
        But an my winding sheet;
        The dew it falls na sooner down
        Then ay it is full weet.

        From England newly come?
    77C.3   Im not your father, the king, he says,
        No, no, nor your brother John;
        But Im your true love, Sweet William,
        From England thats newly come.

        Or any silks so fine?
        Or have ye brought me any precious things,
        That merchants have for sale?
    77C.5   I have not brought you any scarlets sae red,
        No, no, nor the silks so fine;
        But I have brought you my winding-sheet,
        Oer manys the rock and hill.
    77C.6   O Lady Marjory, Lady Marjory,
        For faith and charitie,
        Will you give to me my faith and troth,
        That I gave once to thee?
    77C.7   O your faith and troth Ill not give thee,
        No, no, that will not I,
        Until I get one kiss of your ruby lips,
        And in my arms you come [lye].
    77C.8   My lips they are so bitter, he says,

        If you get one kiss of my ruby lips,
        Your days will not be long.
    77C.9   The cocks they are crowing, Marjory, he says,
        The cocks they are crawing again;
        Its time the deid should part the quick,
        Marjorie, I must be gane.
    77C.10  She followed him high, she followed him low,
        Till she came to yon church-yard;
        O there the grave did open up,
        And young William he lay down.
    77C.11  What three things are these, Sweet William, she says,
        That stands here at your head?
        Its three maidens, Marjorie, he says,
        That I promised once to wed.

        That stands here at your feet?
        It is three hell-hounds, Marjorie, he says,
        Thats waiting my soul to keep.
    77C.14  She took up her white, white hand,
        And she struck him in the breast,
        Saying, Have there again your faith and troth,
        And I wish your soul good rest.

        And she gaed weeping away.
