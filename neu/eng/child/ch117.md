# 117A: The Gest of Robyn Hode


    117A.1   LYTHE and listin, gentilmen,
         That be of frebore blode;
         I shall you tel of a gode yeman,
         His name was Robyn Hode.
    117A.2   Robyn was a prude outlaw,
         [Whyles he walked on grounde;
         So curteyse an outlawe] as he was one
         Was never non founde.
    117A.3   Robyn stode in Bernesdale,
         And lenyd hym to a tre;
         And bi hym stode Litell Johnn,
         A gode yeman was he.
    117A.4   And alsoo dyd gode Scarlok,
         And Much, the millers son;
         There was none ynch of his bodi
         But it was worth a grome.
    117A.5   Than bespake Lytell Johnn
         All vntoo Robyn Hode:
         Maister, and ye wolde dyne betyme
         It wolde doo you moche gode.
    117A.6   Than bespake hym gode Robyn:
         To dyne haue I noo lust,
         Till that I haue som bolde baron,
         Or som vnkouth gest.
    117A.7   . . . . . . .
         That may pay for the best,
         Or som knyght or [som] squyer,
         That dwelleth here bi west.
    117A.8   A gode maner than had Robyn;
         In londe where that he were,
         Euery day or he wold dyne
         Thre messis wolde he here.
    117A.9   The one in the worship of the Fader,
         And another of the Holy Gost,
         The thirde of Our der  Lady,
         That he loued allther moste.
    117A.10  Robyn loued Oure der  Lady;
         For dout of dydly synne,
         Wolde he neuer do compani harme
         That any woman was in.
    117A.11  Maistar, than sayde Lytil Johnn,
         And we our borde shal sprede,
         Tell vs wheder that we shal go,
         And what life that we shall lede.
    117A.12  Where we shall take, where we shall leue,
         Where we shall abide behynde;
         Where we shall robbe, where we shal reue,
         Where we shal bete and bynde.
    117A.13  Therof no force, than sayde Robyn;
         We shall do well inowe;
         But loke ye do no husbonde harme,
         That tilleth with his ploughe.
    117A.14  No more ye shall no gode yeman
         That walketh by gren -wode shawe;
         Ne no knyght ne no squyer
         That wol be a gode felawe.
    117A.15  These bisshoppes and these archebishoppes,
         Ye shall them bete and bynde;
         The hy  sherif of Notyingham,
         Hym holde ye in your mynde.
    117A.16  This worde shalbe holde, sayde Lytell Johnn,
         And this lesson we shall lere;
         It is fer dayes ; God sende vs a gest,
         That we were at oure dynere!
    117A.17  Take thy gode bowe in thy honde, sayde Rob[yn];
         Late Much wende with the;
         And so shal Willyam Scarlo[k],
         And no man abyde with me.
    117A.18  And walke vp to the Saylis,
         And so to Watlingr Stret[e],
         And wayte after some vnkuth gest,
         Vp chaunce ye may them mete.
    117A.19  Be he erle, or ani baron,
         Abbot, or ani knyght,
         Bringhe hym to lodge to me;
         His dyner shall be dight.
    117A.20  They wente vp to the Saylis,
         These yeman all thre;
         They loked est, they loke[d] weest;
         They myght no man see.
    117A.21  But as they loked in to Bernysdale,
         Bi a dern  strete,
         Than came a knyght ridinghe;
         Full sone they gan hym mete.
    117A.22  All dreri was his semblaunce,
         And lytell was his pryde;
         His one fote in the styrop stode,
         That othere wauyd beside.
    117A.23  His hode hanged in his iyn two;
         He rode in symple aray;
         A soriar man than he was one
         Rode neuer in somer day.
    117A.24  Litell Johnn was full curteyes,
         And sette hym on his kne:
         Welcom be ye, gentyll knyght,
         Welcom ar ye to me.
    117A.25  Welcom be thou to gren  wode,
         Hend  knyght and fre;
         My maister hath abiden you fastinge,
         Syr, al these our s thre.
    117A.26  Who is thy maister? sayde the knyght;
         Johnn sayde, Robyn Hode;
         He is [a] gode yoman, sayde the knyght,
         Of hym haue I herde moche gode.
    117A.27  I graunte, he sayde, with you to wende,
         My bretherne, all in fere;
         My purpos was to haue dyned to day
         At Blith or Dancastere.
    117A.28  Furth than went this gentyl knight,
         With a carefull chere;
         The teris oute of his iyen ran,
         And fell downe by his lere.
    117A.29  They  brought hym to the lodg -dore;
         Whan Robyn hym gan see,
         Full curtesly dyd of his hode
         And sette hym on his knee.
    117A.30  Welcome, sir knight, than sayde Robyn,
         Welcome art thou to me;
         I haue abyden you fastinge, sir,
         All these ouris thre.
    117A.31  Than answered the gentyll knight,
         With word s fayre and fre;
         God the saue, goode Robyn,
         And all thy fayre meyn .
    117A.32  They wasshed togeder and wyped bothe,
         And sette to theyr dynere;
         Brede and wyne they had right ynoughe,
         And noumbles of the dere.
    117A.33  Swannes and fessauntes they had full gode,
         And foules of the ryuere;
         There fayled none so litell a birde
         That euer was bred on bryre.
    117A.34  Do gladly, sir knight, sayde Robyn;
         Gramarcy, sir, sayde he;
         Suche a dinere had I nat
         Of all these wekys thre.
    117A.35  If I come ageyne, Robyn,
         Here by thys contr ,
         As gode a dyner I shall the make
         As that thou haest made to me.
    117A.36  Gramarcy, knyght, sayde Robyn;
         My dyner whan that I it haue,
         I was neuer so gredy, bi dere worthy God,
         My dyner for to craue.
    117A.37  But pay or ye wende, sayde Robyn;
         Me thynketh it is gode ryght;
         It was neuer the maner, by dere worthi God,
         A yoman to pay for a knyhht.
    117A.38  I haue nought in my coffers, saide the knyght,
         That I may profer for shame:
         Litell Johnn, go loke, sayde Robyn,
         Ne let nat for no blame.
    117A.39  Tel me truth, than saide Robyn,
         So God haue parte of the:
         I haue no more but ten shelynges, sayde the knyght,
         So God haue parte of me.
    117A.40  If thou hast no more, sayde Robyn,
         I woll nat one peny;
         And yf thou haue nede of any more,
         More shall I lend the.
    117A.41  Go nowe furth, Littell Johnn,
         The truth tell thou me;
         If there be no more but ten shelinges,
         No peny that I se.
    117A.42  Lyttell Johnn sprede downe hys mantell
         Full fayre vpon the grounde,
         And there he fonde in the knyght s cofer
         But euen halfe [a] pounde.
    117A.43  Littell Johnn let it lye full styll,
         And went to hys maysteer [full] lowe;
         What tidyng s, Johnn? sayde Robyn;
         Sir, the knyght is true inowe.
    117A.44  Fyll of the best wine, sayde Robyn,
         The knyght shall begynne;
         Moche wonder thinketh me
         Thy clot[h]ynge is so thin[n]e.
    117A.45  Tell me [one] worde, sayde Robyn,
         And counsel shal it be;
         I trowe thou warte made a knyght of force,
         Or ellys of yemanry.
    117A.46  Or ellys thou hast bene a sori husbande,
         And lyued in stroke and stryfe;
         An okerer, or ellis a lechoure, sayde Robyn,
         Wyth wronge hast led thy lyfe.
    117A.47  I am none of those, sayde the knyght,
         By God that mad  me;
         An hundred wynter here before
         Myn auncetres knyghtes haue be.
    117A.48  But oft it hath befal, Robyn,
         A man hath be disgrate;
         But God that sitteth in heuen aboue
         May amende his state.
    117A.49  Withyn this two yere, Robyne, he sayde,
         My neghbours well it knowe,
         Foure hundred pounde of gode money
         Ful well than myght I spende.
    117A.50  Nowe haue I no gode, saide the knyght,
         God hath shaped such an ende,
         But my chyldren and my wyfe,
         Tyll God yt may amende.
    117A.51  In what maner, than sayde Robyn,
         Hast thou lorne thy rychesse?
         For my great  foly, he sayde,
         And for my kynd[ ]nesse.
    117A.52  I hade a sone, forsoth, Robyn,
         That shulde hau[e] ben myn ayre,
         Whanne he was twenty wynter olde,
         In felde wolde iust full fayre.
    117A.53  He slewe a knyght of Lancaster,
         And a squyer bolde;
         For to saue hym in his ryght
         My godes both sette and solde.
    117A.54  My londes both sette to wedde, Robyn,
         Vntyll a certayn day,
         To a ryche abbot here besyde
         Of Seynt Mari Abbey.
    117A.55  What is the som? sayde Robyn;
         Trouth than tell thou me;
         Sir, he sayde, Foure hundred pounde;
         The abbot told it to me.
    117A.56  Nowe and thou lese thy lond, sayde Robyn,
         What woll fall of the?
         Hastely I wol me buske, sayd the knyght,
         Ouer the salt  see,
    117A.57  And se w[h]ere Criste was quyke and dede,
         On the mount of Caluer ;
         Fare wel, frende, and haue gode day;
         It may no better be.
    117A.58  Teris fell out of hys iyen two;
         He wolde haue gone hys way:
         Farewel, frende, and haue gode day;
         I ne haue no more to pay.
    117A.59  Where be thy frend s? sayde Robyn:
         Syr, neuer one wol me knowe;
         While I was ryche ynowe at home
         Great boste than wolde they blowe.
    117A.60  And nowe they renne away fro me,
         As bestis on a rowe;
         They take no more hede of me
         Thanne they had me neuer sawe.
    117A.61  For ruthe thanne wept Litell Johnn,
         Scarlok and Muche in fere;
         Fyl of the best wyne, sayde Robyn,
         For here is a symple chere.
    117A.62  Hast thou any frende, sayde Robyn,
         Thy borowe that wold  be?
         I haue none, than sayde the knyght,
         But God that dyed on tree.
    117A.63  Do away thy iapis, than sayde Robyn,
         Thereof wol I right none;
         Wenest thou I wolde haue God to borowe,
         Peter, Poule, or Johnn?
    117A.64  Nay, by hym that me made,
         And shope both sonne and mone,
         Fynde me a better borowe, sayde Robyn,
         Or money getest thou none.
    117A.65  I haue none other, sayde the knyght,
         The sothe for to say,
         But yf yt be Our der  Lady;
         She fayled me neuer or thys day.
    117A.66  By dere worthy God, sayde Robyn,
         To seche all Englonde thorowe,
         Yet fonde I neuer to my pay
         A moche better borowe.
    117A.67  Come nowe furth, Litell Johnn,
         And go to my tresour ,
         And bringe me foure hundered pound,
         And loke well tolde it be.
    117A.68  Furth than went Litell Johnn,
         And Scarlok went before;
         He tolde oute foure hundred pounde
         By eight and twenty score.
    117A.69  Is thys well tolde? sayde [litell] Much;
         Johnn sayde, What gre[ue]th the?
         It is almus to helpe a gentyll knyght,
         That is fal in pouert .
    117A.70  Master, than sayde Lityll John,
         His clothinge is full thynne;
         Ye must gyue the knight a lyueray,
         To lappe his body therin.
    117A.71  For ye haue scarlet and grene, mayster,
         And man[y] a riche aray;
         Ther is no marchaunt in mery Englond
         So ryche, I dare well say.
    117A.72  Take hym thre yerdes of euery colour,
         And loke well mete that it be;
         Lytell Johnn toke none other mesure
         But his bow -tree.
    117A.73  And at euery handfull that he met
         He lep d foot s three;
         What deuyll s drapar, sayid litell Muche,
         Thynkest thou for to be?
    117A.74  Scarlok stode full stil and loughe,
         And sayd, By God Almyght,
         Johnn may gyue hym gode mesure,
         For it costeth hym but lyght.
    117A.75  Mayster, than said Litell Johnn
         To gentill Robyn Hode,
         Ye must giue the knig[h]t a hors,
         To lede home this gode.
    117A.76  Take hym a gray coursar, sayde Robyn,
         And a saydle newe;
         He is Oure Ladyes messangere;
         God graunt that he be true.
    117A.77  And a gode palfray, sayde lytell Much,
         To mayntene hym in his right;
         And a peyre of bot s, sayde Scarlock,
         For he is a gentyll knight.
    117A.78  What shalt thou gyue hym, Litell John? said Robyn;
         Sir, a peyre of gilt sporis clene,
         To pray for all this company;
         God bringe hym out of tene.
    117A.79  Whan shal mi day be, said the knight,
         Sir, and your wyll be?
         This day twelue moneth, saide Robyn,
         Vnder this gren -wode tre.
    117A.80  It were greate sham , sayde Robyn,
         A knight alone to ryde,
         Without  squyre, yoman, or page,
         To walk  by his syde.
    117A.81  I shall the lende Litell John, my man,
         For he shalbe thy knaue;
         In a yema[n]s stede he may the stande,
         If thou greate ned  haue.
    117A.82  Now is the knight gone on his way;
         This game hym thought full gode;
         Whanne he loked on Bernesdale
         He blessyd Robyn Hode.
    117A.83  And whanne he thought on Bernysdale,
         On Scarlok, Much, and Johnn,
         He blyssyd them for the best company
         That euer he in come.
    117A.84  Then spake that gentyll knyght,
         To Lytel Johan gan he saye,
         To-morrowe I must to Yorke toune,
         To Saynt Mary abbay.
    117A.85  And to the abbot of that place
         Foure hondred pounde I must pay;
         And but I be there vpon this nyght
         My londe is lost for ay.
    117A.86  The abbot sayd to his couent,
         There he stode on grounde,
         This day twelfe moneth came there a knyght
         And borowed foure hondred pounde.
    117A.87  [He borowed foure hondred pounde,]
         Upon all his lond  fre;
         But he come this ylk  day
         Dysheryte shall he be.
    117A.88  It is full erely, sayd the pryoure,
         The day is not yet ferre gone;
         I had leuer to pay an hondred pounde,
         And lay downe anone.
    117A.89  The knyght is ferre beyonde the see,
         In Englonde is his ryght,
         And suffreth honger and colde,
         And many a sory nyght.
    117A.90  It were grete pyt , said the pryoure,
         So to haue his londe;
         And ye be so lyght of your consyence,
         Ye do to hym moch wronge.
    117A.91  Thou arte euer in my berde, sayd the abbot,
         By God and Saynt Rycharde;
         With that cam in a fat-heded monke,
         The heygh selerer.
    117A.92  He is dede or hanged, sayd the monke,
         By God that bought me dere,
         And we shall haue to spende in this place
         Foure hondred pounde by yere.
    117A.93  The abbot and the hy selerer
         Stert  forthe full bolde,
         The [hye] iustyce of Englonde
         The abbot there dyde holde.
    117A.94  The hy  iustyce and many mo
         Had take in to they[r] honde
         Holy all the knyght s det,
         To put that knyght to wronge.
    117A.95  They demed the knyght wonder sore,
         The abbot and his meyn :

         Thou hast betrayed nowe me.
    117A.190    I make myn auowe to God, sayde Litell Johnn,
         Mayster, ye be to blame;
         I was mysserued of my dynere
         Whan I was with you at home.
    117A.191    Sone he was to souper sette,
         And serued well with siluer white,
         And whan the sherif sawe his vessell,

    117A.192    Make glad chere, sayde Robyn Hode,
         Sherif, for charit ,
         And for the loue of Litill Johnn
         Thy lufe I graunt to the.
    117A.193    Whan they had souped well,
         The day was al gone;
         Robyn commaunde[d] Litell Johnn
         To drawe of his hosen and his shone;
    117A.194    His kirtell, and his cote of pie,
         That was fured well and fine,
         And to[ke] hym a grene mantel,
         To lap his body therin.
    117A.195    Robyn commaundyd his wight yonge men,
         Vnder the gren -wode tree,
         They shulde lye in that same sute,
         That the sherif myght them see.
    117A.196    All nyght lay the proud  sherif
         In his breche and in his [s]chert;
         No wonder it was, in gren  wode,
         Though his syd s gan to smerte.
    117A.197    Make glade chere, sayde Robyn Hode,
         Sheref, for charit ;
         For this is our ordre i-wys,
         Vnder the gren -wode tree.
    117A.198    This is harder order, sayde the sherief,
         Than any ankir or frere;
         For all the golde in mery Englonde
         I wolde nat longe dwell her.
    117A.199    All this twelue monthes, sayde Robin,
         Thou shalt dwell with me;
         I shall the tech , proud  sherif,

    117A.200    Or I be here another nyght, sayde the sherif,
         Robyn, nowe pray I the,
         Smyte of mijn hede rather to-morowe,
         And I forgyue it the.
    117A.201    Lat me go, than sayde the sherif,
         For saynt  charit ,
         And I woll be the best[ ] frende
         That euer yet had ye.
    117A.202    Thou shalt swere me an othe, sayde Robyn,
         On my bright bronde;
         Shalt thou neuer awayte me scathe,

    117A.203    And if thou fynde any of my men,
         By nyght or [by] day,
         Vpon thyn oth  thou shalt swere
         To helpe them tha[t] thou may.
    117A.204    Nowe hathe the sherif sworne his othe,
         And home he began to gone;
         He was as full of gren  wode
         As euer was hepe of stone.
    117A.205    The sherif dwelled in Notingham;
         He was fayne he was agone;
         And Robyn and his mery men
         Went to wode anone.
    117A.206    Go we to dyner, sayde Littell Johnn;
         Robyn Hode sayde, Nay;
         For I drede Our Lady be wroth with me,
         Foe she sent me nat my pay.
    117A.207    Haue no doute, maister, sayde Litell Johnn;
         Yet is nat the sonne at rest;
         For I dare say, and sauely swere,
         The knight is true and truste.
    117A.208    Take thy bowe in thy hande, sayde Robyn,
         Late Much wende with the,
         And so shal Wyllyam Scarlok,

    117A.210    Whether he be messengere,
         Or a man that myrth s can,

    117A.211    Forth then stert Lytel Johan,
         Half in tray and tene,
         And gyrde hym with a full good swerde,
         Under a mantel of grene.

         Make all yon prese to stonde;
         The formost monke, his lyfe and his deth

    117A.221    Who is your mayster? sayd the monke;
         Lytell Johan sayd, Robyn Hode;
         He is a stronge thefe, sayd the monke,
         Of hym herd I neuer good.
    117A.222    Thou lyest, than sayd Lytell Johan,

         Saf a lytell page and a grome,
         To lede the somers with Lytel Johan.
    117A.225    They brought the monke to the lodg -dore,
         Whether he were loth or lefe,
         For to speke with Robyn Hode,

         Seuen score of wyght yemen

    117A.230    And euerych of them a good mantell
         Of scarlet and of raye;
         All they came to good Robyn,
         To wyte what he wolde say.
    117A.231    They made the monke to wasshe and wype,
         And syt at his denere,

         Gramercy, syr, sayd he.
         Where is your abbay, whan ye are at home,
         And who is your avow ?
    117A.233    Saynt Mary abbay, sayd the monke,
         Though I be symple here.
         In what offyce? sayd Robyn:

         She sent me not my pay.
    117A.236    Haue no doute, mayster, sayd Lytell Johan,
         Ye haue no nede, I saye;
         This monke it hath brought, I dare well swere,
         For he is of her abbay.
    117A.237    And she was a borowe, sayd Robyn,
         Betwene a knyght and me,
         Of a lytell money that I hym lent,

    117A.239    The monke swore a full grete othe,
         With a sory chere,
         Of the borowehode thou spekest to me,

    117A.240    I make myn avowe to God, sayd Robyn,
         Monke, thou art to blame;
         For God is holde a ryghtwys man,

         My money for to pay;
         Therfore I cun the mor  thanke

    117A.243    What is in your cofers? sayd Robyn,
         Trewe than tell thou me:

    117A.247    Lytell Johan spred his mantell downe,
         As he had done before,
         And he tolde out of the monk s male
         Eyght [hondred] pounde and more.
    117A.248    Lytell Johan let it lye full styll,
         And went to his mayster in hast;
         Syr, he sayd, The monke is trewe ynowe,

    117A.253    The monke was goynge to London ward,
         There to holde grete mote,

         To seke a monk s male.
    117A.256    How moch is in yonder other corser? sayd Robyn,
         The soth must we see:

         That were no curteysye,
    117A.257    To bydde a man to dyner,
         And syth hym bete and bynde.
         It is our old  maner, sayd Robyn,
         To leue but lytell behynde.
    117A.258    The monke toke the hors with spore,
         No lenger wolde he abyde:
         Ask  to drynk , than sayd Robyn,
         Or that ye forther ryde.
    117A.259    Nay, for God, than sayd the monke,
         Me reweth I cam so nere;

    117A.261    Now lete we that monke be styll,
         And speke we of that knyght:
         Yet he came to holde his day,
         Whyle that it was lyght.
    117A.262    He dyde him streyt to Bernysdale,

    117A.263    The knyght lyght doune of his good palfray;
         Robyn whan he gan see,
         So curteysly he dyde adoune his hode,

         Robyn Hode and his mery men
         Dwelled styll full many a day.
    117A.282    Lyth and lysten, gentil men,
         And herken what I shall say,
         How the proud[ ] sheryfe of Notyngham
         Dyde crye a full fayre play;
    117A.283    That all the best archers of the north
         Sholde come vpon a day,
         And [he] that shoteth allther best
         The game shall bere a way.
    117A.284    He that shoteth allther best,
         Furthest fayre and lowe,
         At a payre of fynly buttes,
         Under the gren -wode shawe,
    117A.285    A ryght good arowe he shall haue,
         The shaft of syluer whyte,
         The hede and the feders of ryche red golde,
         In Englond is none lyke.
    117A.286    This than herde good Robyn,
         Under his trystell-tre:
         Make you redy, ye wyght yonge men;
         That shotynge wyll I se.
    117A.287    Buske you, my mery yonge men,
         Ye shall go with me;
         And I wyll wete the shryu s fayth,
         Trewe and yf he be.
    117A.288    Whan they had theyr bowes i-bent,
         Theyr takles fedred fre,
         Seuen score of wyght yonge men
         Stode by Robyns kne.
    117A.289    Whan they cam to Notyngham,
         The buttes were fayre and longe;
         Many was the bolde archere
         That shoted with bow s stronge.
    117A.290    There shall but syx shote with me;
         The other shal kepe my he[ue]de,
         And stand  with good bow s bent,
         That I be not desceyued.
    117A.291    The fourth outlawe his bowe gan bende,
         And that was Robyn Hode,
         And that behelde the proud[ ] sheryfe,
         All by the but [as] he stode.
    117A.292    Thry s Robyn shot about,
         And alway he slist the wand,
         And so dyde good Gylberte
         Wyth the whyt  hande.
    117A.293    Lytell Johan and good Scatheloke
         Were archers good and fre;
         Lytell Much and good Reynolde,
         The worste wolde they not be.
    117A.294    Whan they had shot aboute,
         These archours fayre and good,
         Euermore was the best,
         For soth, Robyn Hode.
    117A.295    Hym was delyuered the good arowe,
         For best worthy was he;
         He toke the yeft so curteysly,
         To gren  wode wolde he.
    117A.296    They cryed out on Robyn Hode,
         And grete horn s gan they blowe:
         Wo worth the, treason! sayd Robyn,
         Full euyl thou art to knowe.
    117A.297    And wo be thou! thou proud  sheryf,
         Thus gladdynge thy gest;
         Other wyse thou behot  me
         In yonder wylde forest.
    117A.298    But had I the in gren  wode,
         Under my trystell-tre,
         Thou sholdest leue me a better wedde
         Than thy trewe lewt .
    117A.299    Full many a bow  there was bent,
         And arow s let they glyde;
         Many a kyrtell there was rent,
         And hurt many a syde.
    117A.300    The outlawes shot was so stronge
         That no man myght them dryue,
         And the proud[ ] sheryf s men,
         They fled away full blyue.
    117A.301    Robyn sawe the busshement to-broke,
         In gren  wode he wolde haue be;
         Many an arowe there was shot
         Amonge that company.
    117A.302    Lytell Johan was hurte full sore,
         With an arowe in his kne,
         That he myght neyther go nor ryde;
         It was full grete pyt .
    117A.303    Mayster, then sayd Lytell Johan,
         If euer thou loue[d]st me,
         And for that ylk  lord s loue
         That dyed vpon a tre,
    117A.304    And for the medes of my seruyce,
         That I haue serued the,
         Lete neuer the proud  sheryf
         Alyue now fynd  me.
    117A.305    But take out thy brown  swerde,
         And smyte all of my hede,
         And gyue me wound s depe and wyde;
         No lyfe on me be lefte.
    117A.306    I wolde not that, sayd Robyn,
         Johan, that thou were slawe,
         For all the golde in mery Englonde,
         Though it lay now on a rawe.
    117A.307    God forbede, sayd Lytell Much,
         That dyed on a tre,
         That thou sholdest, Lytell Johan,
         Parte our company.
    117A.308    Up he toke hym on his backe,
         And bare hym well a myle;
         Many a tyme he layd hym downe,
         And shot another whyle.
    117A.309    n was there a fayre castell,
         A lytell within the wode;
         Double-dyched it was about,
         And walled, by the rode.
    117A.310    And there dwelled that gentyll knyght,
         Syr Rychard at the Lee,
         That Robyn had lent his good,
         Under the gren -wode tree.
    117A.311    In he toke good Robyn,
         And all his company:
         Welcome be thou, Robyn Hode,
         Welcome arte thou to me;
    117A.312    And moche [I] thanke the of thy confort,
         And of thy curteysye,
         And of thy gret  kynd nesse,
         Under the gren -wode tre.
    117A.313    I loue no man in all this worlde
         So much as I do the;
         For all the proud[ ] sheryf of Notyngham,
         Ryght here shalt thou be.
    117A.314    Shyt the gates, and drawe the brydge,
         And let no man come in,
         And arme you well, and make you redy,
         And to the walles ye wynne.
    117A.315    For one thynge, Robyn, I the behote;
         Iswere by Saynt Quyntyne,
         These forty dayes thou wonnest with me,
         To soupe, ete, and dyne.
    117A.316    Bordes were layde, and clothes were spredde,
         Redely and anone;
         Robyn Hode and his mery men
         To met  can they gone.
    117A.317    Lythe and lysten, gentylmen,
         And herkyn to your songe;

         And sayde, Thou traytour knight,
         Thou kepest here the kynges enemys,
         Agaynst the lawe and right.
    117A.320    Syr, I wyll auowe that I haue done,
         The dedys that here be dyght,
         Vpon all the land s that I haue,

    117A.321    Wende furth, sirs, on your way,
         And do no more to me
         Tyll ye wyt oure kyng s wille,
         What he wyll say to the.
    117A.322    The shyref thus had his answere,
         Without any lesynge;
         [Fu]rth he yede to London towne,

         And also of the bolde archars,
         That were soo noble and gode.
    117A.324    He wyll auowe that he hath done,
         To mayntene the outlawes stronge;
         He wyll be lorde, and set you at nought,

         Within this fourteenyght,

    117A.326    Go nowe home, shyref, sayde our kynge,
         And do as I byd the;
         And ordeyn gode archers ynowe,
         Of all the wyd  contr .
    117A.327    The shyref had his leue i-take,
         And went hym on his way,
         And Robyn Hode to gren  wode,
         Vpon a certen day.
    117A.328    And Lytel John was hole of the arowe
         That shot was in his kne,
         And dyd hym streyght to Robyn Hode,
         Vnder the grene-wod  tree.
    117A.329    Robyn Hode walked in the forest,
         Vnder the leuys grene;
         The proud  shyref of Notyngham
         Thereof he had grete tene.

         With men of armys stronge,
         And led hym to Notyngham warde,

         With knyght s in grete araye,
         For to take that gentyll knyght
         And Robyn Hode, and yf he may.
    117A.355    He asked men of that countr 
         After Robyn Hode,
         And after that gentyll knyght,
         That was so bolde and stout.
    117A.356    Whan they had tolde hym the case
         Our kynge vnderstode ther tale,
         And seased in his honde
         The knyght s lond s all.

         He went both ferre and nere,
         Tyll he came to Plomton Parke;
         He faylyd many of his dere.
    117A.358    There our kynge was wont to se
         Herd s many one,

         That bare ony good horne.
    117A.359    The kynge was wonder wroth withall,
         And swore by the Trynyt ,
         I wolde I had Robyn Hode,

    117A.360    And he that wolde smyte of the knyght s hede,
         And brynge it to me,
         He shall haue the knyght s londes,
         Syr Rycharde at the Le.
    117A.361    I gyue it hym with my charter,
         And sele it [with] my honde,
         To haue and holde for euer more,
         In all mery Englonde.
    117A.362    Than bespake a fayre olde knyght,
         That was treue in his fay:
         A, my leeg  lorde the kynge,
         One worde I shall you say.
    117A.363    There is no man in this countr 
         May haue the knyght s londes,
         Whyle Robyn Hode may ryde of gone,
         And bere a bowe in his hondes,
    117A.364    That he ne shall lese his hede,
         That is the best ball in his hode:
         Giue it no man, my lorde the kynge,
         That ye wyll any good.
    117A.365    Half a yere dwelled our comly kynge
         In Notyngham, and well more;
         Coude he not here of Robyn Hode,
         In what countr  that he were.
    117A.366    But alway went good Robyn
         By halke and eke by hyll,
         And alway slewe the kyng s dere,
         And welt them at his wyll.
    117A.367    Than bespake a proude fostere,
         That stode by our kyng s kne;
         Yf ye wyll se good Robyn,

         On lyue yf that he be;

         So were his knyght s fyue,
         Euerych of them in monk s wede,
         And hasted them thyder blyve.
    117A.372    Our kynge was grete aboue his cole,
         A brode hat on his crowne,
         Ryght as he were abbot-lyke,
         They rode up in-to the towne.
    117A.373    Styf bot s our kynge had on,

    117A.374    His male-hors and his gret  somers
         Folowed our kynge behynde,
         Tyll they came to gren  wode,

    117A.375    There they met with good Robyn,
         Stondynge on the waye,
         And so dyde many a bolde archere,
         For soth as I you say.
    117A.376    Robyn toke the kyng s hors,
         Hast ly in that stede,
         And sayd, Syr abbot, by your leue,
         A whyle ye must abyde.
    117A.377    We be yemen of this foreste,

         Gyue vs some of your spendynge,
         For saynt[ ] charyt .
    117A.379    Than bespake our cumly kynge,
         Anone than sayd he;
         I brought no more to gren  wode
         But forty pounde with me.
    117A.380    I haue layne at Notyngham
         This fourtynyght with our kynge,
         And spent I haue full moche good,
         On many a grete lordynge.
    117A.381    And I haue but forty pounde,
         No more than haue I me;
         But yf I had an hondred pounde,
         I wolde vouch it safe on the.
    117A.382    Robyn toke the forty pounde,
         And departed it in two partye;
         Halfendell he gaue his mery men,
         And bad them mery to be.
    117A.383    Full curteysly Robyn gan say;
         Syr, haue this for your spendyng;
         We shall mete another day;
         Gramercy, than sayd our kynge.
    117A.384    But well the greteth Edwarde, our kynge,
         And sent to the his seale,
         And byddeth the com to Notyngham,
         Both to mete and mele
    117A.385    He toke out the brod  targe,
         And sone he lete hym se;
         Robyn coud his courteysy,
         And set hym on his kne.
    117A.386    I loue no man in all the worlde
         So well as I do my kynge;
         Welcome is my lord s seale;
         And, monke, for thy tydynge,
    117A.387    Syr abbot, for thy tydynges,
         To day thou shalt dyne with me,
         For the loue of my kynge,
         Under my trystell-tre.
    117A.388    Forth he lad our comly kynge,
         Full fayre by the honde;
         Many a dere there was slayne,
         And full fast dyghtande.
    117A.389    Robyn toke a full grete horne,
         And loude he gan blowe;
         Seuen score of wyght yonge men
         Came redy on a rowe.
    117A.390    All they kneled on theyr kne,
         Full fayre before Robyn:
         The kynge sayd hym selfe vntyll,
         And swore by Saynt Austyn,
    117A.391    Here is a wonder semely syght;
         Me thynketh, by Godd s pyne,
         His men are more at his byddynge
         Then my men be at myn.
    117A.392    Full hast[ ]ly was theyr dyner idyght,
         And therto gan they gone;
         They serued our kynge with al theyr myght,
         Both Robyn and Lytell Johan.
    117A.393    Anone before our kynge was set
         The fatt  venyson,
         The good whyte brede, the good rede wyne,
         And therto the fyne ale and browne.
    117A.394    Make good chere, said Robyn,
         Abbot, for charyt ;
         And for this ylk  tydynge,
         Blyssed mote thou be.
    117A.395    Now shalte thou se what lyfe we lede,
         Or thou hens wende;
         Than thou may enfourme our kynge,
         Whan ye togyder lende.
    117A.396    Up they stert  all in hast,
         Theyr bow s were smartly bent;
         Our kynge was neuer so sore agast,
         He wende to haue be shente.
    117A.397    Two yerd s there were vp set,
         Thereto gan they gange;
         By fyfty pase, our kynge sayd,
         The merk s were to longe.
    117A.398    On euery syde a rose-garlonde,
         They shot vnder the lyne:
         Who so fayleth of the rose-garlonde, sayd Robyn,
         His takyll he shall tyne,
    117A.399    And yelde it to his mayster,
         Be it neuer so fyne;
         For no man wyll I spare,
         So drynke I ale or wyne:
    117A.400    And bere a buffet on his hede,
         I-wys ryght all bare:
         And all that fell in Robyns lote,
         He smote them wonder sare.
    117A.401    Twyse Robyn shot aboute,
         And euer he cleued the wande,
         And so dyde good Gylberte
         With the Whyt  Hande.
    117A.402    Lytell Johan and good Scathelocke,
         For nothynge wolde they spare;
         When they fayled of the garlonde,
         Robyn smote them full sore.
    117A.403    At the last shot that Robyn shot,
         For all his frend s fare,
         Yet he fayled of the garlonde
         Thre fyngers and mare.
    117A.404    Than bespake good Gylberte,
         And thus he gan say;
         Mayster, he sayd, your takyll is lost,
         Stande forth and take your pay.
    117A.405    If it be so, sayd Robyn,
         That may no better be,
         Syr abbot, I delyuer the myn arowe,
         I pray the, syr, serue thou me.
    117A.406    It falleth not for myn ordre, sayd our kynge,
         Robyn, by thy leue,
         For to smyte no good yeman,
         For doute I sholde hym greue.
    117A.407    Smyte on boldely, sayd Robyn,
         I giue the larg  leue:
         Anone our kynge, with that worde,
         He folde vp his sleue,
    117A.408    And sych a buffet he gaue Robyn,
         To grounde he yede full nere:
         I make myn avowe to God, sayd Robyn,
         Thou arte a stalworthe frere.
    117A.409    There is pith in thyn arme, sayd Robyn,
         I trowe thou canst well shete:
         Thus our kynge and Robyn Hode
         Togeder gan they mete.
    117A.410    Robyn beheld our comly kynge
         Wystly in the face,
         So dyde Syr Rycharde at the Le,
         And kneled downe in that place.
    117A.411    And so dyde all the wylde outlawes,
         Whan they se them knele:
         My lorde the kynge of Englonde,
         Now I knowe you well.
    117A.412    Mercy then, Robyn, sayd our kynge,
         Vnder your trystyll-tre,
         Of thy goodnesse and thy grace,
         For my men and me!
    117A.413    Yes, for God, sayd Robyn,
         And also God me saue,
         I ask  mersy, my lorde the kynge,
         And for my men I craue.
    117A.414    Yes, for God, than sayd our kynge,
         And therto sent I me,
         With that thou leue the gren  wode,
         And all thy company;
    117A.415    And come home, syr, to my courte,
         And there dwell with me.
         I make myn avowe to God, sayd Robyn,
         And ryght so shall it be.
    117A.416    I wyll come to your courte,
         Your seruyse for to se,
         And brynge with me of my men
         Seuen score and thre.
    117A.417    But me lyk  well your seruyse,
         I [wyll] come agayne full soone,
         And shote at the donn  dere,
         As I am wonte to done.
    117A.418    Haste thou ony gren  cloth, sayd our kynge,
         That thou wylte sell nowe to me?
         Ye, for God, sayd Robyn,
         Thyrty yerd s and thre.
    117A.419    Robyn, sayd our kynge,
         Now pray I the,
         Sell me some of that cloth,
         To me and my meyn .
    117A.420    Yes, for God, then sayd Robyn,
         Or elles I were a fole;
         Another day ye wyll me clothe,
         I trowe, ayenst the Yole.
    117A.421    The kynge kest of his col  then,
         A grene garment he dyde on,
         And euery knyght also, i-wys,
         Another had full sone.
    117A.422    Whan they were clothed in Lyncolne grene,
         They keste away theyr graye;
         Now we shall to Notyngham,
         All thus our kynge gan say.
    117A.423    They bente theyr bowes, and forth they went,
         Shotynge all in-fere,
         Towarde the towne of Notyngham,
         Outlawes as they were.
    117A.424    Our kynge and Robyn rode togyder,
         For soth as I you say,
         And they shote plucke-buffet,
         As they went by the way.
    117A.425    And many a buffet our kynge wan
         Of Robyn Hode that day,
         And nothynge spared good Robyn
         Our kynge in his pay.
    117A.426    So God me help , sayd our kynge,
         Thy game is nought to lere;
         I sholde not get a shote of the,
         Though I shote all this yere.
    117A.427    All the people of Notyngham
         They stode and behelde;
         They sawe nothynge but mantels of grene
         That couered all the felde.
    117A.428    Than euery man to other gan say,
         I drede our kynge be slone;
         Com  Robyn Hode to the towne, i-wys
         On lyue he lefte neuer one.
    117A.429    Full hast[ ]ly they began to fle,
         Both yemen and knaues,
         And olde wyues that myght euyll goo,
         They hypped on theyr staues.
    117A.430    The kynge l[o]ughe full fast,
         And commaunded them agayne;
         When they se our comly kynge,
         I-wys they were full fayne.
    117A.431    They ete and dranke, and made them glad,
         And sange with not s hye;
         Than bespake our comly kynge
         To Syr Rycharde at the Lee.
    117A.432    He gaue hym there his londe agayne,
         A good man he bad hym be;
         Robyn thanked our comly kynge,
         And set hym on his kne.
    117A.433    Had robyn dwelled in the kyng s courte
         But twelue monethes and thre,
         That [he had] spent an hondred pounde,
         And all his mennes fe.
    117A.434    In euery place where Robyn came
         Euer more he layde downe,
         Both for knyght s and for squyres,
         To gete hym grete renowne.
    117A.435    By than the yere was all agone
         He had no man but twayne,
         Lytell Johan and good Scathlocke,
         With hym all for to gone.
    117A.436    Robyn sawe yonge men shote
         Full fayre vpon a day;
         Alas! than sayd good Robyn,
         My welthe is went away.
    117A.437    Somtyme I was an archere good,
         A styffe and eke a stronge;
         I was compted the best archere
         That was in mery Englonde.
    117A.438    Alas! then sayd good Robyn,
         Alas and well a woo!
         Yf I dwele lenger with the kynge,
         Sorowe wyll me sloo.
    117A.439    Forth than went Robyn Hode
         Tyll he came to our kynge:
         My lorde the kynge of Englonde,
         Graunte me myn askynge.
    117A.440    I made a chapell in Bernysdale,
         That semely is to se,
         It is of Mary Magdaleyne,
         And thereto wolde I be.
    117A.441    I myght neuer in this seuen nyght
         No tyme to slepe ne wynke,
         Nother all these seuen dayes
         Nother ete ne drynke.
    117A.442    Me longeth sore to Bernysdale,
         I may not be therfro;
         Barefote and wolwarde I haue hyght
         Thyder for to go.
    117A.443    Yf it be so, than sayd our kynge,
         It may no better be,
         Seuen nyght I gyue the leue,
         No lengre, to dwell fro me.
    117A.444    Gramercy, lorde, then sayd Robyn,
         And set hym on his kne;
         He toke his leu  full courteysly.
         To gren  wode then went he.
    117A.445    Whan he came to gren  wode,
         In a mery mornynge,
         There he herde the not s small

    117A.446    It is ferre gone, sayd Robyn,
         That I was last here;
         Me lyste a lytell for to shote
         At the donn  dere.
    117A.447    Robyn slewe a full grete harte;
         His horne than gan he blow,
         That all the outlawes of that forest
         That horne coud they knowe,
    117A.448    And gadred them togyder,
         In a lytell throwe.
         Seuen score of wyght yonge men
         Came redy on a rowe,
    117A.449    And fayre dyde of theyr hodes,
         And set them on theyr kne:
         Welcome, they sayd, our [der ] mayster,
         Under this gren -wode tre.
    117A.450    Robyn dwelled in gren  wode
         Twenty yere and two;
         For all drede of Edwarde our kynge,
         Agayne wolde he not goo.
    117A.451    Yet he was begyled, i-wys,
         Through a wycked woman,
         The pryoresse of Kyrk sly,
         That nye was of hys kynne:
    117A.452    For the loue of a knyght,
         Syr Roger of Donkesly,
         That was her own  speciall;
         Full euyll mot  they the!
    117A.453    They toke togyder theyr counsell
         Robyn Hode for to sle,
         And how they myght best do that dede,
         His banis for to be.
    117A.454    Than bespake good Robyn,
         In place where as he stode,
         To morow I muste to Kyrke[s]ly,
         Craftely to be leten blode.
    117A.455    Syr Roger of Donkestere,
         By the pryoresse he lay,
         And there they betrayed good Robyn Hode,
         Through theyr fals  playe.
    117A.456    Cryst haue mercy on his soule,
         That dyed on the rode!
         For he was a good outlawe,
         And dyde pore men moch god.
