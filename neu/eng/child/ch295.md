# 295A: The Brown Girl


    295A.1   I am as brown as brown can be,
         My eyes as black as a sloe;
         I am as brisk as a nightingale,
         And as wilde as any doe.
    295A.2   My love has sent me a love-letter,
         Not far from yonder town,
         That he could not fancy me,
         Because I was so brown.
    295A.3   I sent him his letter back again,
         For his love I valud not,
         Whether that he could fancy me
         Or whether he could not.
    295A.4   He sent me his letter back again,
         That he lay dangerous sick,
         That I might then go speedily
         To give him up his faith.
    295A.5   Now you shall hear what love she had
         Then for this love-sick man;
         She was a whole long summers day
         In a mile a going on.
    295A.6   When she came to her loves bed-side,
         Where he lay dangerous sick,
         She could not for laughing stand
         Upright upon her feet.
    295A.7   She had a white wand all in her hand,
         And smoothd it all on his breast;
         In faith and troth come pardon me,
         I hope your souls at rest.
    295A.8   Ill do as much for my true-love
         As other maidens may;
         Ill dance and sing on my loves grave
         A whole twelvemonth and a day.

### 295B: The Brown Girl


    295B.1   I am as brown as brown can be,
         And my eyes as black as sloe;
         I am as brisk as brisk can be,
         And wild as forest doe.
    295B.2   My love he was so high and proud,
         His fortune too so high,
         He for another fair pretty maid
         Me left and passed me by.
    295B.3   Me did he send a love-letter,
         He sent it from the town,
         Saying no more he loved me,
         For that I was so brown.
    295B.4   I sent his letter back again,
         Saying his love I valued not,
         Whether that he would fancy me,
         Whether that he would not.
    295B.5   When that six months were overpassd,
         Were overpassd and gone,
         Then did my lover, once so bold,
         Lie on his bed and groan.
    295B.6   When that six months were overpassd,
         Were gone and overpassd,
         O then my lover, once so bold,
         With love was sick at last.
    295B.7   First sent he for the doctor-man:
         You, doctor, me must cure;
         The pains that now do torture me
         I can not long endure.
    295B.8   Next did he send from out the town,
         O next did send for me;
         He sent for me, the brown, brown girl
         Who once his wife should be.
    295B.9   O neer a bit the doctor-man
         His sufferings could relieve;
         O never an one but the brown, brown girl
         Who could his life reprieve.
    295B.10  Now you shall hear what love she had
         For this poor love-sick man,
         How all one day, a summers day,
         She walked and never ran.
    295B.11  When that she came to his bedside,
         Where he lay sick and weak,
         O then for laughing she could not stand
         Upright upon her feet.
    295B.12  You flouted me, you scouted me,
         And many another one;
         Now the reward is come at last,
         For all that you have done.
    295B.13  The rings she took from off her hands,
         The rings by two and three:
         O take, O take these golden rings,
         By them remember me.
    295B.14  She had a white wand in her hand,
         She strake him on the breast:
         My faith and troth I give back to thee,
         So may thy soul have rest.
    295B.15  Prithee, said he, Forget, forget,
         Prithee forget, forgive;
         O grant me yet a little space,
         That I may be well and live.
    295B.16  O never will I forget, forgive,
         So long as I have breath;
         Ill dance above your green, green grave
         Where you do lie beneath.
