# 220A: The Bonny Lass of Anglesley


    220A.1   OUR king he has a secret to tell,
         And ay well keepit it must be:
         The English lords are coming down
         To dance and win the victory.
    220A.2   Our king has cryd a noble cry,
         And ay well keepit it must be:
         Gar saddle ye, and bring to me
         The bonny lass of Anglesey.
    220A.3   Up she starts, as white as the milk,
         Between him and his company:
         What is the thing I hae to ask,
         If I sould win the victory?
    220A.4   Fifteen ploughs but and a mill
         I gie thee till the day thou die,
         And the fairest knight in a my court
         To chuse thy husband for to be.
    220A.5   Shes taen the fifteen lord[s] by the hand,
         Saying, Will ye come dance with me?
         But on the morn at ten oclock
         They gave it oer most shamefully.
    220A.6   Up then rais the fifteenth lord-+--+-
         I wat an angry man was he-+--+-
         Laid by frae him his belt and sword,
         And to the floor gaed manfully.
    220A.7   He said, My feet shall be my dead
         Before she win the victory;
         But before twas ten oclock at night
         He gaed it oer as shamefully.

### 220B: The Bonny Lass of Anglesley


    220B.1   WORD has gane thro a this land,
         And O well noticed it maun be!
         The English lords are coming down
         To dance and gain the victorie.
    220B.2   The king has made a noble cry,
         And well attended it maun be:
         Come saddle ye, and bring to me
         The bonny lass o Englessie.
    220B.3   She started up, a dressd in white,
         Between him and his companie;
         Said, What will ye gie, my royal liege,
         If I will dance this dance for thee?
    220B.4   Five good ploughs but and a mill
         Ill give you till the day ye die;
         The bravest knight in all my court,
         Ill give, your husband for to be.
    220B.5   Shes taen the first lord by the hand,
         Says, Yell rise up and dance wi me;
         But she made a these lords fifeteen
         To gie it up right shamefullie.
    220B.6   Then out it speaks a younger lord,
         Says, Fye for shame! how can this be?
         He loosd his brand frae aff his side,
         Likewise his buckler frae his knee.
    220B.7   He sware his feet should be his dead
         Before he lost the victorie;
         He dancd full fast, but tired at last,
         And gae it up as shamefullie.
