# 36: The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea


    36.1    I WAS but seven year auld
        When my mither she did die;
        My father married the ae warst woman
        The warld did ever see.
    36.2    For she has made me the laily worm,
        That lies at the fit o the tree,
        An my sister Masery shes made
        The machrel of the sea.
    36.3    An every Saturday at noon
        The machrel comes to me,
        An she takes my laily head
        An lays it on her knee,
        She kaims it wi a siller kaim,
        An washest in the sea.
    36.4    Seven knights hae I slain,
        Sin I lay at the fit of the tree,
        An ye war na my ain father,
        The eight ane ye should be.
    36.5    Sing on your song, ye laily worm,
        That ye did sing to me:
        I never sung that song but what
        I would it sing to thee.
    36.6    I was but seven year auld,
        When my mither she did die;
        My father married the ae warst woman
        The warld did ever see.
    36.7    For she changed me to the laily worm,
        That lies at the fit o the tree,
        And my sister Masery
        To the machrel of the sea.
    36.8    And every Saturday at noon
        The machrel comes to me,
        An she takes my laily head
        An lays it on her knee,
        An kames it wi a siller kame,
        An washes it i the sea.
    36.9    Seven knights hae I slain,
        Sin I lay at the fit o the tree,
        An ye war na my ain father,
        The eighth ane ye shoud be.
    36.10   He sent for his lady,
        As fast as send could he:
        Whar is my son that ye sent frae me,
        And my daughter, Lady Masery?
    36.11   Your son is at our kings court,
        Serving for meat an fee,
        An your daughters at our queens court,
        . . . . . 
    36.12   Ye lie, ye ill woman,
        Sae loud as I hear ye lie;
        My sons the laily worm,
        That lies at the fit o the tree,
        And my daughter, Lady Masery,
        Is the machrel of the sea!
    36.13   She has tane a siller wan,
        An gien him strokes three,
        And he has started up the bravest knight
        That ever your eyes did see.
    36.14   She has taen a small horn,
        An loud an shrill blew she,
        An a the fish came her untill
        But the proud machrel of the sea:
        Ye shapeit me ance an unseemly shape,
        An yes never mare shape me.
    36.15   He has sent to the wood
        For whins and for hawthorn,
        An he has taen that gay lady,
        An there he did her burn.
