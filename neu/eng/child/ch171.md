# 171A: Thomas Cromwell


    171A.*   * * *
         . . . .
         . . . .
         Ffor if your boone be askeable,
         Soone granted it shalbe:
    171A.2   If it be not touching my crowne, he said,
         Nor hurting poore comminaltye.
         Nay, it is not touching your crowne, shee sayes,
         Nor hurting poore cominaltye,
    171A.3   But I begg the death of Thomas Cromwell,
         For a false traitor to you is hee.
         Then feitch me hither the Earle of Darby
         And the Earle of Shrewsbury,
    171A.4   And bidde them bring Thomas Cromawell;
         Lets see what he can say to mee;
         For Thomas had woont to haue carryed his head vp,
         But now he hanges it vppon his knee.
    171A.5   How now? How now? the king did say,
         Thomas, how is it with thee?
         Hanging and drawing, O king! he saide;
         You shall neuer gett more from mee.
