# 104A: Prince Heathen


    104A.1  LADY MARGERY MAY sits in her bower,
        Sewing at her seem;
        By there comes a heathen knight,
        From her her maidenhead has tane.
    104A.2  He has put her in a tower strong,
        With double locks on fifty doors:
        Lady Margery May, will you ga now?
        O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.
    104A.3  I am asking, you heathen knight;
        What I am asking will you grant to me?
        Will ye let one of your waitmen
        A drink of your well bring to me?
    104A.4  Meat nor drink you shall never get,
        Nor out of that shall you never come,
        Meat nor drink shall you never get,
        Until you bear to me daughter or son.
    104A.5  Thus time drew on, and further on,
        For travail came this young lady to;
        She travailed up, so did she down,
        But lighter could she never be.
    104A.6  An asking, an asking, you heathen knight;
        An asking will you grant to me?
        Will you give me a scread of silk,
        For to row your young son wi?
    104A.7  He took the horse-sheet in his hand,
        The tears came twinkling down:
        Lady Margaret May, will ye ga now?
        O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.
    104A.8  Ill wash my young son with the milk,
        I will dry my young son with the silk;
        For hearts will break, and bands will bow;
        So dear will I love my lady now!

### 104B: Prince Heathen


    104B.1  LADY MARGARET sat in her bower-door,
        Sewing at her silken seem,
        When by it came Prince Heathen then,
        An gae to her a gay gold ring.
    104B.2  He turnd about, an gied a bow;
        She said, Begone, I love na you;
        When he sware by his yellow hair
        That he woud gar her greet fu sair.
    104B.3  But she sware by her milk-white skin
        Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane:
        But she sware by her milk-white skin
        Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane:
          Refrain:  O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
        Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
    104B.4  Hes taen her in his arms twa,
        Laid her between him an the wa,
        An ere he let her free again,
        Her maidenhead frae her hes taen.
          Refrain:  O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
        Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
    104B.5  I killd your father in his bed,
        And your gay mother by his side,
        And your seven brothers, ane by ane,
        And they were seven pretty men.
          Refrain:  O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
        Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
    104B.6  Ill put you in a vault o stone,
        Where five an thirty locks hing on;
        Naebody there then shall you see,
        For I will keep the keys wi me.
          Refrain:  O bonny may, winna ye greet now?
        Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
    104B.7  Hes put her in a vault o stone,
        Where five an thirty locks hing on;
        Naebody there coud eer her see,
        Prince Heathen kept the keys him wi.
          Refrain:  But ae she cried, What shall I do!
        The heathenish dog has gart me rue.
    104B.8  Prince heathen from the mountains came,
        Attended by his armed men,
        And hes gane to the bonny may,
        And to the prison where she lay:
          Refrain:  O bonny may, what do you now?
        Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
    104B.9  Ill take you out upon the green,
        Where women ye shall neer see ane,
        But only me and my young men,
        Till ye bring daughter hame or son.
          Refrain:  O bonny may, what do you now?
        Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
    104B.10 Hes taen her out upon the green,
        Where she saw women never ane,
        But only him and s merry young men,
        Till she brought hame a bonny young son.
          Refrain:  O bonny may, what do you now?
        Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
    104B.11 A drink, a drink, frae Prince Heathens hand,
        Though it were frae yon cauld well strong!
        O neer a drap, Prince Heathen, said one,
        Till ye row up your bonny young son.
        How can I row up my bonny young son.
        When I hae naething to row him in?
    104B.12 I will lend you my horses sheet,
        That will row him baith head and feet.
        As soons she took it in her han,
        Tears oer her cheeks down rapping ran.
          Refrain:  O bonny may, ye do greet now:
        Ye heathenish dog, but nae for you.
    104B.13 But a is for my bonny young son;
        Your sheets are rough to row him in;
        Ohon, alas, sair may I rue
        That eer I saw such rogues as you!
    104B.14 Yell row my young son in the silk,
        An ye will wash him wi the milk,
        An lay my lady very saft,
        That I may see her very aft.
        When hearts are broken, bands will bow;
        Sae wells he loved his lady now!
