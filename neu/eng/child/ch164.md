# 164A: King Henry Fifth’s Conquest of France


    164A.1   AS our king lay musing on his bed,
         He bethought himself upon a time
         Of a tribute that was due from France,
         Had not been paid for so long a time.
         Fal, lal, etc.
    164A.2   He called for his lovely page,
         His lovely page then called he,
         Saying, You must go to the king of France,
         To the king of France, sir, ride speedily.
    164A.3   O then went away this lovely page,
         This lovely page then away went he;
         And when he came to the king of France,
         Low he fell down on his bended knee.
    164A.4   My master greets you, worthy sir;
         Ten ton of gold that is due to he,
         That you will send him his tribute home,
         Or in French land you soon will him see.
    164A.5   Your masters young and of tender years,
         Not fir to come into my degree,
         And I will send him three tennis-balls,
         That with them he may learn to play.
    164A.6   O then returned this lovely page,
         This lovely page then returned he,
         And when he came to our gracious king,
         Low he fell down on his bended knee.
    164A.7   What news, what news, my trusty page?
         What is the news you have brought to me?
         I have brought such news from the king of France
         That you and he will never agree.
    164A.8   He says youre young and of tender years,
         Not fit to come into his degree,
         And he will send you three tennis-balls,
         That with them you may learn to play.
    164A.9   Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire,
         And Derby Hills that are so free;
         No marryd man nor no widows son;
         For no widows curse shall go with me.
    164A.10  They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire,
         And Derby Hills that are so free;
         No marryd man, nor no widows son;
         Yet there was a jovial bold company.
    164A.11  O then we marchd into the French land,
         With drums and trumpets so merrily;
         And then bespoke the king of France,
         Lo, yonder comes proud King Henry.
    164A.12  The first shot that the Frenchmen gave,
         They killd our Englishmen so free;
         We killd ten thousand of the French,
         And the rest of them they ran away.
    164A.13  And then we marched to Paris gates,
         With drums and trumpets so merrily:
         O then bespoke the king of France,
         The Lord have mercy on my men and me!
    164A.14  O I will send him his tribute home,
         Ten ton of gold that is due to he,
         And the finest flower that is in all France
         To the Rose of England I will give free.
