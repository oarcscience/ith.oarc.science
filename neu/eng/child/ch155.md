         Throw down the ba to me!
         Never a bit, says the jews daughter,
         Till up to me come ye.
    155A.5   How will I come up?  How can I come up?
         How can I come to thee?
         For  as ye did to my auld father,
         The same yell do to me.

         And pud an apple red and green;
         Twas a to wyle him sweet Sir Hugh,

         Shes laid him on a dressing-table,
         And stickit him like a swine.
    155A.8   And first came out the thick, thick blood,
         And syne came out the thin,
         And syne came out the bonny hearts blood;
         There was nae mair within.
    155A.9   Shes rowd him in a cake o lead,

         Shes thrown him in Our Ladys draw-well,

         And a the bairns came hame,
         When every lady gat hame her son,
         The Lady Maisry gat nane.
    155A.11  Shes taen her mantle her about,
         Her coffer by the hand,
         And shes gane out to seek her son,
         And wanderd oer the land.
    155A.12  Shes doen her to the Jews castell,
         Where a were fast asleep:
         Gin ye be there, my sweet Sir Hugh,
         I pray you to me speak.
    155A.13  Shes doen her to the Jews garden,
         Thought he had been gathering fruit:
         Gin ye be there, my sweet Sir Hugh,
         I pray you to me speak.
    155A.14  She neard Our Ladys deep draw-well,

    155A.15  Gae hame, gae hame, my mither dear,
         Prepare my winding-sheet,
         And at the back o merry Lincoln
         The morn I will you meet.
    155A.16  Now Lady Maisry is gane hame,
         Made him a winding sheet,
         And at the back o merry Lincoln
         The dead corpse did her meet.
    155A.17  And a the bells of merry Lincoln
         Without mens hands were rung,
         And a the books o merry Lincoln
         Were read without mans tongue,
         And neer was such a burial
         Sin Adams days begun.

    155E.1   YESTERDAY was brave Hallowday,
         And, above all days of the year,
         The schoolboys all got leave to play,
         And little Sir Hugh was there.
    155E.2   He kicked the ball with his foot,
         And kepped it with his knee,
         And even in at the Jews window
         He gart the bonnie ba flee.

         Throw down the ball to me!

         Till ye come up to me.
    155E.5   She pud the apple frae the tree,
         It was baith red and green;
         She gave it unto little Sir Hugh,
         With that his heart did win.
    155E.6   She wiled him into ae chamber,
         She wiled him into twa,
         She wiled him into the third chamber,
         And that was warst ot a.

         And a word he neer spak mair.
    155E.8   And first came out the thick, thick blood,
         And syne came out the thin,
         And syne came out the bonnie hearts blood,
         There was nae mair within.
    155E.9   She laid him on a dressing-table,
         She dressd him like a swine;
         Says, Lie ye there, my bonnie Sir Hugh,
         Wi yere apples red and green!
    155E.10  She put him in a case of lead,
         Says, Lie ye there and sleep!
         She threw him into the deep draw-well,
         Was fifty fathom deep.
    155E.11  A schoolboy walking in the garden
         Did grievously hear him moan;
         He ran away to the deep draw-well,
         And fell down on his knee.
    155E.12  Says, Bonnie Sir Hugh, and pretty Sir Hugh,
         I pray you speak to me!
         If you speak to any body in this world,
         I pray you speak to me.
    155E.13  When bells were rung, and mass was sung,
         And every body went hame,
         Then every lady had her son,
         But Lady Helen had nane.
    155E.14  She rolled her mantle her about,
         And sore, sore did she weep;
         She ran away to the Jews castle,
         When all were fast asleep.
    155E.15  She cries, Bonnie Sir Hugh, O pretty Sir Hugh,
         I pray you speak to me!
         If you speak to any body in this world,
         I pray you speak to me.
    155E.16  Lady Helen, if ye want your son,
         Ill tell ye where to seek;
         Lady Helen, if ye want your son,
         Hes in the well sae deep.
    155E.17  She ran away to the deep draw-well,
         And she fell down on her knee,
         Saying, Bonnie Sir Hugh, O pretty Sir Hugh,
         I pray ye speak to me!
         If ye speak to any body in the world,
         I pray ye speak to me.
    155E.18  Oh the lead it is wondrous heavy, mother,
         The well it is wondrous deep;
         The little penknife sticks in my throat,
         And I downa to ye speak.
    155E.19  But lift me out o this deep draw-well,
         And bury me in yon churchyard;
         . . . .
         . . . .
    155E.20  Put a Bible at my head, he says,
         And a Testament at my feet,
         And pen and ink at every side,
         And Ill lie still and sleep.
    155E.21  And go to the back of Maitland town,
         Bring me my winding sheet;
         For its at the back of Maitland town
         That you and I shall meet.
    155E.22  O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom that makes full sore,
         A womans mercy is very little,
         But a mans mercy is more.

         Without my playfellows too.
    155F.3   She took an apple out of her pocket,
         And trundled it along the plain,
         And who was readiest to lift it
         Was little Sir Hugh again.
    155F.4   She took him by the milk-white han,
         An led him through many a hall,
         Until they came to one stone chamber,
         Where no man might hear his call.
    155F.5   She set him in a goolden chair,
         And jaggd him with a pin,
         And called for a goolden cup
         To houl his hearts blood in.
    155F.6   She tuk him by the yellow hair,
         An also by the feet,
         An she threw him in the deep draw-well;
         It was fifty fadom deep.
    155F.7   Day bein over, the night came on,
         And the scholars all went home;
         Then every mother had her son,
         But little Sir Hughs had none.
    155F.8   She put a mantle about her head,
         Tuk a little rod in her han,
         An she says, Sir Hugh, if I fin you here,
         I will bate you for stayin so long.

         But they were fast asleep;
         An then she went to the deep draw-well,
         That was fifty fadom deep.
    155F.10  She says, Sir Hugh, if you be here,
         As I suppose you be,
         If ever the dead or quick arose,
         Arise and spake to me.
    155F.11  Yes, mother dear, I am here,
         I know I have staid very long;
         But a little penknife was stuck in my heart,
         Till the stream ran down full strong.
    155F.12  And mother dear, when you go home,
         Tell my playfellows all
         That I lost my life by leaving them,
         When playing that game of ball.
    155F.13  And ere another day is gone,
         My winding-sheet prepare,
         And bury me in the green churchyard,
         Where the flowers are bloomin fair.
    155F.14  Lay my Bible at my head,
         My Testament at my feet;
         the earth and worms shall be my bed,
         Till Christ and I shall meet.

         She shewed him a cherry as red as blood,
         Which enticed the little boy in.
    155G.6   She took him by the lily-white hand,
         And led him into the hall,
         And laid him on a dresser-board,
         And that was the worst of all.
    155G.7   She laid the Bible at his head,
         The Prayer-Book at his feet,
         And with a penknife small
         She stuck him like a sheep.
    155G.8   Six pretty maids took him by the head,
         And six took him by the feet,
         And threw him into a deep draw-well,
         That was eighteen fathoms deep.
         * * * * *
    155G.9   The lead is wondrous heavy, mother,
         The well is wondrous deep,
         A keen pen-knife sticks in my heart,
         And nae word more can I speak.

### 155H: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155H.1   IT rains, it rains in fair Scotland,
         It rains both great and small
         . . . .
         . . . .
    155H.2   He tossed the ball so high, so low,
         He tossed the ball so low,
         He tossed it over the Jews garden-wall,
         Where no none dared to go.
    155H.3   Out came one of the Jews daughters,
         All dressed in apple-green;
         Said she, My dear little boy, come in,
         And pick up your ball again.
    155H.4   I dare not come, I will not come,
         I dare not come at all;
         For if I should, I know you would
         Cause my blood to fall.
    155H.5   She took him by the lily-white hand,
         And led him thro the kitchen;
         And there he saw his own dear maid
         A roasting of a chicken.
    155H.6   She put him in a little chair,
         And pinned him with a pin,
         And then she called for a wash-basin,
         To spill his life blood in.
    155H.7   O put the Bible at my head,
         And the Testament at my feet,
         And when my mother calls for me,
         You may tell her Im gone to sleep.

### 155I: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155I.1   the recitation of an aged lady.
         IT rains, it rains in merry Scotland,
         It rains both great and small,
         And all the children in merry Scotland
         Are playing at the ball.
    155I.2   They toss the ball so high, so high,
         They toss the ball so low,
         They toss the ball in the Jews garden,
         Where the Jews are sitting a row.
    155I.3   Then up came one of the Jews daughters,
         Cloathed all in green:
         Come hither, come hither, my pretty Sir Hugh,
         And fetch thy ball again.
    155I.4   I durst not come, I durst not go,
         Without my play-fellowes all;
         For if my mother should chance to know,
         Shed cause my blood to fall.
         * * * * *
    155I.5   She laid him upon the dresser-board,
         And stuck him like a sheep;
         She laid the Bible at his head,
         The Testament at his feet,
         The Catechise-Book in his own hearts blood,
         With a penknife stuck so deep.
         * * * * *

### 155J: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155J.1   IT rains, it rains in merry Scotland,
         Both little, great and small,
         And all the schoolfellows in merry Scotland
         Must needs go play at ball.
    155J.2   They tossd the ball so high, so high,
         With that it came down so low;
         They tossd it over the old Jews gates,
         And broke the old Jews window.
    155J.3   The old Jews daughter she came out,
         Was clothed all in green:
         Come hither, come hither, you young Sir Hugh,
         And fetch your ball again.
    155J.4   I dare not come, nor I will not come,
         Without my schoolfellows come all;
         For I shall be beaten when I go home
         For losing of my ball.
    155J.5   She  ticed him with an apple so red,
         And likewise with a fig;
         She threw him over the dresser-board,
         And sticked him like a pig.
    155J.6   The first came out the thickest of blood,
         The second came out so thin,
         The third came out the childs heart-blood,
         Where all his life lay in.
    155J.7   O spare my life! O spare my life!
         O spare my life! said he;
         If ever I live to be a young man,
         Ill do as good chare for thee.
    155J.8   Ill do as good chare for thy true love
         As ever I did for the king;
         I will scour a basin as bright as silver
         To let your heart-blood run in.
    155J.9   When eleven oclock was past and gone,
         And all the school-fellows came home,
         Every mother had her own child
         But young Sir Hughs mother had none.
    155J.10  She went up Lincoln and down Lincoln,
         And all about Lincoln street,
         With her small wand in her right hand,
         Thinking of her child to meet.
    155J.11  She went till she came to the old Jews gate,
         She knocked with the ring;
         Who should be so ready as the old Jew herself
         To rise and let her in!
    155J.12  What news, fair maid? what news, fair maid?
         What news have you brought to me?
         . . . . .
         . . . .
    155J.13  Have you seen any of my child today,
         Or any of the rest of my kin?
         No, Ive seen none of your child today,
         Nor none of the rest of your kin.

### 155K: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155K.1   IT hails, it rains, in Merry-Cock land,
         It hails, it rains, both great and small,
         And all the little children in Merry-Cock land
         They have need to play at ball.
    155K.2   They tossd the ball so high,
         They tossd the ball so low,
         Amongst all the Jews cattle,
         And amongst the Jews below.
    155K.3   Out came one of the Jews daughters,
         Dressed all in green;
         Come, my sweet Saluter,
         And fetch the ball again.
    155K.4   I durst not come, I must not come,
         Unless all my little playfellows come along;
         For if my mother sees me at the gate,
         Shell cause my blood to fall.
    155K.5   She showd me an apple as green as grass,
         She showd me a gay gold ring;
         She showd me a cherry as red as blood,
         And so she enticd me in
    155K.6   She took me in the parlor,
         She took me in the kitchen,
         And there I saw my own dear nurse,
         A picking of a chicken.
    155K.7   She laid me down to sleep,
         With a Bible at my head and a Testament at my feet;
         And if my playfellows come to quere for me,
         Tell them I am asleep.

### 155L: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155L.1   IT rains, it hails in merry Lincoln,
         It rains both great and small,
         And all the boys and girls today
         Do play at pat the ball.
    155L.2   They patted the ball so high, so high,
         They patted the ball so low,
         They patted it into the Jews garden,
         Where all the Jews do go.
    155L.3   Then out it spake the Jews daughter,
         As she leant over the wall;
         Come hither, come hither, my pretty playfellow,
         And Ill give you your  ball.
    155L.4   She tempted him [in] with apple so red,
         But that wouldnt tempt him in;
         She tempted him in with sugar so sweet,
         And so she got him in.
    155L.5   Then she put forth her lilly-white hand,
         And led him through the hall:
         This way, this way, my pretty play-fellow,
         And you shall have your ball.
    155L.6   She led him on through one chamber,
         And so she did through nine,
         Until she came to her own chamber,
         Where she was wont to dine,
         And she laid him on a dressing-board,
         And sticket him like a swine.
    155L.7   Then out it came the thick, thick blood,
         And out it came the thin,
         And out it came the bonnie hearts blood,
         There was no more within.

### 155M: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155M.1   DOWN in merry, merry Scotland
         It rained both hard and small;
         Two little boys went out one day,
         All for to play with a ball.
    155M.2   They tossed it up so very, very high,
         They tossed it down so low;
         They tossed it into the Jews garden,
         Where the flowers all do blow.
    155M.3   Out came one of the Jews daughters,
         Dress d in green all:
         If you come here, my fair pretty lad,
         You shall have your ball.
    155M.4   She showed him an apple as green as grass;
         The next thing was a fig;
         The next thing a cherry as red as blood,
         And that would tice him in.
    155M.5   set him on a golden chair,
         And gave him sugar sweet;
         Laid him on some golden chest of drawers,
         Stabbed him like a sheep.
    155M.6   Seven foot Bible
         At my head and my feet;
         If my mother pass by me,
         Pray tell her Im asleep.

### 155N: Sir Hugh, or the Jew’s Daughter


    155N.1   IT was on a May, on a midsummers day,
         When it rained, it did rain small;
         And little Harry Hughes and his playfellows all
         Went out to play the ball.
    155N.2   He knocked it up, and he knocked it down,
         He knocked it oer and oer;
         The very first kick little Harry gave the ball,
         He broke the dukes windows all.
    155N.3   She came down, the youngest dukes daughter,
         She was dressed in green:
         Come back, come back, my pretty little boy,
         And play the ball again.
    155N.4   I wont come back, and I darent come back,
         Without my playfellows all;
         And if my mother she should come in,
         Shed make it the bloody ball.
    155N.5   She took an apple out of her pocket,
         And rolled it along the plain;
         Little Harry Hughes picked up the apple,
         And sorely rued the day.
    155N.6   She takes him by the lily-white hand,
         And leads him from hall to hall,
         Until she came to a little dark room,
         That no one could hear him call.
    155N.7   She sat herself on a golden chair,
         Him on another close by,
         And theres where she pulled out her little penknife,
         That was both sharp and fine.
    155N.8   Little Harry Hughes had to pray for his soul,
         For his days were at an end;
         She stuck her penknife in little Harrys heart,
         And first the blood came very thick, and then came very thin.
    155N.9   She rolled him in a quire of tin,
         That was in so many a fold;
         She rolled him from that to a little draw-well,
         That was fifty fathoms deep.
    155N.10  Lie there, lie there, little Harry, she cried,
         And God forbid you to swim,
         If you be a disgrace to me,
         Or to any of my friends.
    155N.11  The day passed by, and the night came on,
         And every scholar was home,
         And every mother had her own child,
         But poor Harrys mother had none.
    155N.12  She walked up and down the street,
         With a little sally rod in her hand,
         And God directed her to the little draw-well,
         That was fifty fathoms deep.
    155N.13  If you be there, little Harry, she said,
         And God forbid you to be,
         Speak one word to your own dear mother,
         That is looking all over for thee.
    155N.14  This I am, dear mother, he cried,
         And lying in great pain,
         With a little penknife lying close to my heart,
         And the dukes daughter has me slain.
    155N.15  Give my blessing to my schoolfellows all,
         And tell them to be at the church,
         And make my grave both large and deep,
         And my coffin of hazel and green birch.
    155N.16  Put my Bible at my head,
         My busker (?) at my feet,
         My little prayer-book at my right side,
         And sound will be my sleep.

         Of all days in the year,
         And all the little schoolfellows went out to play,
         Bat Sir William was not there.
