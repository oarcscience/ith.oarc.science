# 93A: Lamkin


    93A.1   ITS Lamkin was a mason good
        As ever built wi stane;
        He built Lord Wearies castle,
        But payment got he nane.
    93A.2   O pay me, Lord Wearie,
        come, pay me my fee:
        I canna pay you, Lamkin,
        For I maun gang oer the sea.
    93A.3   O pay me now, Lord Wearie,
        Come, pay me out o hand:
        I canna pay you, Lamkin,
        Unless I sell my land.
    93A.4   O gin ye winna pay me,
        I here sall mak a vow,
        Before that ye come hame again,
        ye sall hae cause to rue.
    93A.5   Lord Wearie got a bonny ship,
        to sail the saut sea faem;
        Bade his lady weel the castle keep,
        ay till he should come hame.
    93A.6   But the nourice was a fause limmer
        as eer hung on a tree;
        She laid a plot wi Lamkin,
        whan her lord was oer the sea.
    93A.7   She laid a plot wi Lamkin,
        when the servants were awa,
        Loot him in at a little shot-window,
        and brought him to the ha.
    93A.8   O whares a the men o this house,
        that ca me Lamkin?
        Theyre at the barn-well thrashing;
        twill be lang ere they come in.
    93A.9   And whares the women o this house,
        that ca me Lamkin?
        Theyre at the far well washing;
        twill be lang ere they come in.
    93A.10  And whares the bairns o this house,
        that ca me Lamkin?
        Theyre at the school reading;
        twill be night or they come hame.
    93A.11  O whares the lady o this house,
        that cas me Lamkin?
        Shes up in her bower sewing,
        but we soon can bring her down.
    93A.12  Then Lamkins tane a sharp knife,
        that hang down by his gaire,
        And he has gien the bonny babe
        A deep wound and a sair.
    93A.13  Then Lamkin he rocked,
        and the fause nourice sang,
        Till frae ilkae bore o the cradle
        the red blood out sprang.
    93A.14  Then out it spak the lady,
        as she stood on the stair:
        What ails my bairn, nourice,
        that hes greeting sae sair?
    93A.15  O still my bairn, nourice,
        O still him wi the pap!
        He winna still, lady,
        for this nor for that.
    93A.16  O still my bairn, nourice,
        O still him wi the wand!
        He winna still, lady,
        for a his fathers land.
    93A.17  O still my bairn, nourice,
        O still him wi the bell!
        He winna still, lady,
        till ye come down yoursel.
    93A.18  O the firsten step she steppit,
        she steppit on a stane;
        But the neisten step she steppit,
        she met him Lamkin.
    93A.19  O mercy, mercy, Lamkin,
        hae mercy upon me!
        Though youve taen my young sons life,
        Ye may let mysel be.
    93A.20  O sall I kill her, nourice,
        or sall I lat her be?
        O kill her, kill her, Lamkin,
        for she neer was good to me.
    93A.21  O scour the bason, nourice,
        and mak it fair and clean,
        For to keep this ladys hearts blood,
        For shes come o noble kin.
    93A.22  There need nae bason, Lamkin,
        lat it run through the floor;
        What better is the hearts blood
        o the rich than o the poor?
    93A.23  But ere three months were at an end,
        Lord Wearie came again;
        But dowie, dowie was his heart
        when first he came hame.
    93A.24  O whas blood is this, he says,
        That lies in the chamer?
        It is your ladys hearts blood;
        tis as clear as the lamer.
    93A.25  And whas blood is this, he says,
        That lies in my ha?
        It is your young sons hearts blood;
        tis the clearest ava.
    93A.26  O sweetly sang the black-bird
        that sat upon the tree;
        But sairer grat Lamkin,
        when he was condemnd to die.
    93A.27  And bonny sang the mavis,
        Out o the thorny brake;
        But sairer grat the nourice,
        when she was tied to the stake.

### 93B: Lamkin


    93B.1   BALANKIN was as gude a mason
        as eer picked a stane;
        He built up Prime Castle,
        but payment gat nane.
    93B.2   The lord said to his lady,
        when he was going abroad,
        O beware of Balankin,
        for he lyes in the wood.
    93B.3   The gates they were bolted,
        baith outside and in;
        At the sma peep of a window
        Blankin crap in.
    93B.4   Good morrow, good morrow,
        said Lambert Linkin:
        Good morrow to yoursell, sir,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93B.5   O where is your good lord?
        said Lambert Linkin:
        Hes awa to New England,
        to meet with his king.
    93B.6   O where is his auld son?
        said Lambert Linkin:
        Hes awa to buy pearlings,
        Gin our lady lye in.
    93B.7   Then shell never wear them,
        said Lambert Linkin:
        And that is nae pity,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93B.8   O where is your lady?
        said Lambert Linkin:
        Shes in her bower sleeping,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93B.9   How can we get at her?
        said Lambert Linkin:
        Stab the babe to the heart,
        wi a silver bokin.
    93B.10  That would be a pity,
        said Lambert Linkin:
        No pity, no pity,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93B.11  Balankin he rocked,
        and the false nurse she sang,
        Till all the tores of the cradle
        wi the red blood down ran.
    93B.12  O still my babe, nurice,
        O still him wi the knife!
        Hell no be still, lady,
        tho I lay doun my life.
    93B.13  O still my babe, nurice,
        O still him wi the kame!
        Hell be no still, lady,
        till his daddy come hame.
    93B.14  O still my babe, nurice,
        O still him wi the bell!
        Hell no be still, lady,
        till ye come doun yoursell.
    93B.15  Its how can I come down,
        this cauld winter nicht,
        Without eer a coal,
        or a clear candle-licht?
    93B.16  Theres two smocks in your coffer,
        as white as a swan;
        Put one of them about you,
        it will shew you licht down.
    93B.17  She took ane o them about her,
        and came tripping doun;
        But as soon as she viewed,
        Balankin was in.
    93B.18  Good morrow, good morrow,
        said Lambert Linkin:
        Good morrow to yoursell, sir,
        said the lady to him.
    93B.19  O save my life, Balankin,
        till my husband come back,
        And Ill gie you as much red gold
        as youll hold in your hat.
    93B.20  Ill not save your life, lady,
        till your husband come back,
        Tho you would give me as much red gold
        as I could hold in a sack.
    93B.21  Will I kill her? quo Balankin,
        will I kill her, or let her be?
        You may kill her, said the false nurse,
        She was neer good to me;
        And yell be laird of the castle,
        and Ill be ladie.
    93B.22  Then he cut aff her head
        fram her lily breast-bane,
        And he hungt up in the kitchen,
        it made a the ha shine.
    93B.23  The lord sat in England,
        a drinking the wine:
        I wish a may be weel
        with my lady at hame;
        For the rings of my fingers
        there now burst in twain!
    93B.24  He saddled his horse,
        and he came riding doun,
        But as soon as he viewed,
        Balankin was in.
    93B.25  He had na weel stepped
        twa steps up the stair,
        Till he saw his pretty young son
        lying dead on the floor.
    93B.26  He had not weel stepped
        other twa up the stair,
        Till he saw his pretty lady
        lying dead in despair.
    93B.27  He hanged Balankin
        out over the gate,
        And he burnt the fause nurice,
        being under the grate.

### 93C: Lamkin


    93C.1   LAMERLINKIN, as gude a mason
        as eer laid a stane,
        Built a house to Lord Arran,
        but entrance had nane.
    93C.2   Says the lord to his lady,
        when going abroad,
        Take care of Lamerlinkin,
        wha bides in the wood.
    93C.3   I care not for Lamkin,
        nor none of his kin;
        My house is plastered outside,
        and bolted within.
    93C.4   The gates they were locked,
        baith outside and in,
        But there was a wee hole
        that let Lamkin creep in.
    93C.5   Good woman, good woman,
        said Lamerlinkin:
        Good woman, good woman,
        said the fause nurse to him.
    93C.6   Wheres the lord o this house?
        is he not within?
        Hes up in Old England,
        hes dining wi the king.
    93C.7   Wheres the lady of this house?
        or is she not within?
        Shes up in her high room,
        and cannot come down.
    93C.8   Where is the maids o this house?
        or are they not within?
        They are at the well washing,
        and cannot get in.
    93C.9   Where is the men o this house?
        or are they not within?
        They are at the barn threshing,
        and cannot win hame.
    93C.10  O what will I do,
        to mak her come doun?
        Well kill her auld son,
        to mak her come doun.
    93C.11  He took out a pen-knife,
        baith pointed and sharp,
        And he stabbed the babie
        three times in the heart.
    93C.12  Lamerlinkin did rock,
        and the fause nurse did sing;
        Ower the four-cornered cradle
        the red blood did spring.
    93C.13  O please my babie, nurse,
        O please him wi wands!
        Hell no be pleased, madam,
        for a his fathers lands.
    93C.14  O please my babie, nurse,
        O please him wi keys!
        Hell no be pleased, madam,
        let me do what I please.
    93C.15  O please my babie, nurse,
        O please him with bells!
        Hell no be pleased, madam,
        till you come down yoursell.
    93C.16  How can I come doun
        this cold frosty night,
        Without coal or candle
        for to shew me light?
    93C.17  The gold rings on your finger
        are bright as the sun;
        You may see to cum doun the stair
        with the light o them.
    93C.18  O then she came doun the stair,
        stepping step by step;
        So ready was Lamkin
        to grip her in his lap.
    93C.19  Save my life, Lamkin,
        till five minutes break,
        And Ill give thee gold,
        the fu o a peck.
    93C.20  Ill no save your life,
        till five minutes break,
        Tho thou should give me gold,
        the fu of a sack.
    93C.21  O Jeany, O Jeany,
        O scour the bason clean,
        That your ladys noble blood
        may be kepped clean.
    93C.22  O no, no, no, Lambkin,
        my heart will be sare;
        O take my life, Lambkin,
        let my lady go.
        * * * * *
    93C.23  He sent for the false nurse,
        to give her her fee;
        All the fee that he gave her
        was to hang her on a tree.
    93C.24  sent for Lamerlinkin,
        to give him his hire;
        All the hire that he gave him
        was to burn him in the fire.

### 93D: Lamkin


    93D.1   SAID the lord to his lady,
        Beware of Rankin;
        For I am going to England,
        to wait on the king.
    93D.2   No fears, no fears,
        said the lady, said she,
        For the doors shall be bolted,
        and the windows pindee.
    93D.3   Go bar all the windows,
        both outside and in;
        Dont leave a window open,
        to let Bold Rankin in.
    93D.4   She has barred all the windows,
        both outside and in;
        But she left one of them open,
        to let Bold Rankin in.
    93D.5   O where is the master of this house?
        said Bold Rankin;
        Hes up in Old England.
        said the false nurse to him.
    93D.6   O where is the mistress of this house?
        said Bold Rankin;
        Shes up in the chamber sleeping,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93D.7   O how shall we get her down?
        said Bold Rankin;
        By piercing the baby,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93D.8   Go please the baby, nursy,
        go please it with a bell;
        It will not be pleased, madam,
        till you come down yoursel.
    93D.9   How can I come down stairs,
        so late into the night,
        Without coal or candle,
        to shew me the light?
    93D.10  There is a silver bolt
        lies on the chest-head;
        Give it to the baby,
        give it sweet milk and bread.
    93D.11  She rammed the silver bolt
        up the babys nose,
        Till the blood it came trinkling
        down the babys fine clothes.
    93D.12  Go please the baby, nursie,
        go please it with the bell:
        It will not please, madam,
        till you come down yoursel.
    93D.13  It will neither please with breast-milk,
        nor yet with pap;
        But I pray, loving lady,
        Come and roll it in your lap.
    93D.14  The first step she stepit,
        she steppit on a stone;
        And the next step she stepit,
        she met Bold Rankin.
    93D.15  O rankin, O Rankin,
        spare me till twelve oclock,
        And I will give you as many guineas
        as you can carry on your back.
    93D.16  What care I for as many guineas
        as seeds into a sack,
        When I cannot keep my hands off
        your lily-white neck?
    93D.17  O will I kill her, nursie,
        or let her abee?
        O kill her, said the false nurse,
        She was never good to me.
    93D.18  Go scour the bason, lady,
        both outside and in,
        To hold your mothers hearts blood,
        sprung from a noble kin.
    93D.19  To hold my mothers hearts blood
        would make my heart full woe;
        O rather kill me, Rankin,
        and let my mother go.
    93D.20  Go scour the bason, servants,
        both outside and in,
        To hold your ladys hearts blood,
        sprung from a noble kin.
    93D.21  To hold my ladys hearts blood
        would make my heart full woe;
        O rather kill me, Rankin,
        and let my lady go.
    93D.22  Go scour the bason, nursy,
        both outside and in,
        To hold your ladys hearts blood,
        sprung from a noble kin.
    93D.23  To hold my ladys hearts blood
        would make my heart full glad;
        Ram in the knife, Bold Rankin,
        and gar the blood to shed.
    93D.24  Shes none of my comrades,
        shes none of my kin;
        Ram in the knife, Bold Rankin,
        and gar the blood rin.
    93D.25  O will I kill her, nursy,
        or let her abee?
        O kill her, said the false nurse,
        She was never good to me.
        * * * * *
    93D.26  I wish my wife and family
        may be all well at home;
        For the silver buttons of my coat
        they will not stay on.
    93D.27  As Betsy was looking
        oer her window so high,
        She saw her dear father
        come riding by.
    93D.28  O father, dear father,
        dont put the blame on me
        It was false nurse and Rankin
        that killed your lady.
    93D.29  O wasnt that an awful sight,
        when he came to the stair,
        To see his fairest lady
        lie bleeding there!
    93D.30  The false nurse was burnt
        on the mountain hill-head,
        And Rankin was boiled
        in a pot full of lead.

### 93E: Lamkin


    93E.1   LAMBKIN was as good a mason
        as ever laid stone;
        He builded Lord Montgomerys castle,
        but payment got none.
    93E.2   He builded the castle
        without and within;
        But he left an open wake
        for himself to get in.
    93E.3   Lord Montgomery said to his lady,
        when he went abroad,
        Take care of Bold Lambkin,
        for he is in the wood.
    93E.4   Gar bolt the gate, nourice,
        without and within,
        Leave not the wake open,
        to let Bold Lambkin in.
    93E.5   She bolted the gates,
        without and within,
        But she left the wake open,
        to let Bold Lambkin in.
    93E.6   Gude morrow, gude morrow,
        says Bold Lambkin then;
        Gude morrow, gude morrow,
        says the false nurse to him.
    93E.7   Where is Lord Montgomery?
        or where is he gone?
        He is gone up to England,
        to wait on the king!
    93E.8   Where are the servants?
        and where are they gone?
        They are all up to England,
        to wait upon him.
    93E.9   Where is your lady?
        or where is she gone?
        She is in her bower sitting,
        and sewing her seam.
    93E.10  O what shall we do
        for to make her come down?
        Well kill the pretty baby,
        thats sleeping so sound.
    93E.11  Lambkin he rocked,
        and the false nurse she sung,
        And she stabbed the babe to the heart
        with a silver bodkin.
    93E.12  O still my babe, nourice,
        O still him with the pap:
        Hell no be stilled, madam,
        for this nor for that.
    93E.13  O still my babe, nourice,
        go still him with the keys:
        Hell no be stilled, madam,
        let me do what I please.
    93E.14  O still my babe, nourice,
        go still him with the bell:
        Hell no be stilled, madam,
        till you come down yoursel.
    93E.15  How can I come down,
        this cold winter night,
        When theres neither coal burning,
        nor yet candle-light?
    93E.16  The sark on your back
        is whiter than the swan;
        Come down the stair, lady,
        by the light of your hand.
    93E.17  The lady she cam down
        the stair trip for trap;
        Who so ready as Bold Lambkin
        to meet her in the dark?
    93E.18  Gude morrow, gude morrow,
        said Bold Lambkin then;
        Gude morrow, gude morrow,
        said the lady to him.
    93E.19  O where is Lord Montgomery?
        or where is he gone?
        O he is up to England,
        to wait on the king.
    93E.20  O where are your servants?
        or where are they gone?
        They are all up to England,
        to wait upon him.
    93E.21  Ill give you as much gold, Lambkin,
        as youll put in a peck,
        If youll spare my life
        till my lord comes back.
    93E.22  Tho you would [give] me as much
        as I could put in a sack,
        I would not spare thy life
        till thy lord comes back.
    93E.23  Lord Montgomery sate in England,
        drinking with the king;
        The buttons flew off his coat,
        all in a ring.
    93E.24  God prosper, God prosper
        my lady and son!
        For before I get home
        they will all be undone.

### 93F: Lamkin


    93F.1   SAID my lord to his ladye,
        as he mounted his horse, (bis)
        Take care of Long Lankyn,
        who lies in the moss. (bis)
    93F.2   Said my lord to his ladye,
        as he rode away,
        Take care of Long Lankyn,
        who lies in the clay.
    93F.3   Let the doors be all bolted,
        and the windows all pinned,
        And leave not a hole
        for a mouse to creep in.
    93F.4   Then he kissed his fair ladye,
        and he rode away;
        He must be in London
        before break of day.
    93F.5   The doors were all bolted,
        and the windows were pinned,
        All but one little window,
        where Long Lankyn crept in.
    93F.6   Where is the lord of this house?
        said Long Lankyn:
        He is gone to fair London,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93F.7   Where is the ladye of this house?
        said Long Lankyn:
        Shes asleep in her chamber,
        said the false nurse to him.
    93F.8   Where is the heir of this house?
        said Long Lankyn:
        Hes asleep in his cradle,
        said the false nurse to him.
        * * * * *
    93F.9   Well prick him, and prick him,
        all over with a pin,
        And that will make your ladye
        to come down to him.
    93F.10  So she pricked him and pricked,
        all over with a pin,
        And the nurse held a basin
        for the blood to run in.
    93F.11  Oh nurse, how you sleep!
        Oh nurse, how you snore!
        And you leave my little son Johnstone
        to cry and to roar.
    93F.12  Ive tried him with suck,
        and Ive tried him with pap;
        So come down, my fair ladye,
        and nurse him in your lap.
    93F.13  Oh nurse, how you sleep!
        Oh nurse, how you snore!
        And you leave my little son Johnstone
        to cry and to roar.
    93F.14  Ive tried him with apples,
        Ive tried him with pears;
        So come down, my fair ladye,
        and rock him in your chair.
    93F.15  How can I come down,
        tis so late in the night,
        When theres no candle burning,
        nor fire to give light?
    93F.16  You have three silver mantles
        as bright as the sun;
        So come down, my fair ladye,
        by the light of one.
        * * * * *
    93F.17  Oh spare me, Long Lankyn,
        oh spare me till twelve oclock,
        You shall have as much gold
        as you can carry on your back.
    93F.18  If I had as much gold
        as would build me a tower,
        . . . . .
        . . . . .
    93F.19  Oh spare me, Long Lankyn,
        oh spare me one hour,
        You shall have my daughter Betsy,
        she is a sweet flower.
    93F.20  Where is your daughter Betsy?
        she may do some good;
        She can hold the silver basin,
        to catch your hearts blood.
        * * * * *
    93F.21  Lady Betsy was sitting
        in her window so high,
        And she saw her father,
        as he was riding by.
    93F.22  Oh father, oh father,
        dont lay the blame on me;
        Twas the false nurse and Long Lankyn
        that killed your ladye.
        * * * * *
    93F.23  Then Long Lankyn was hanged
        on a gallows so high,
        And the false nurse was burnt
        in a fire just by.

### 93G: Lamkin


    93G.1   THE lord said to his ladie,
        as he mounted his horse,
        Beware of Long Lonkin,
        that lies in the moss.
    93G.2   The lord said to his ladie,
        as he rode away,
        Beware of Long Lonkin,
        that lies in the clay.
    93G.3   What care I for Lonkin,
        or any of his gang?
        My doors are all shut,
        and my windows penned in.
    93G.4   There were six little windows,
        and they were all shut,
        But one little window,
        and that was forgot.
    93G.5   . . . . .
        . . . . .
        And at that little window
        long Lonkin crept in.
    93G.6   Wheres the lord of the hall?
        says the Lonkin:
        Hes gone up to London,
        says Orange to him.
    93G.7   Wheres the men of the hall?
        says the Lonkin:
        Theyre at the field ploughing,
        says Orange to him.
    93G.8   Wheres the maids of the hall?
        says the Lonkin:
        Theyre at the well washing,
        says Orange to him.
    93G.9   Wheres the ladies of the hall?
        says the Lonkin:
        Theyre up in their chambers,
        says Orange to him.
    93G.10  How shall we get them down?
        says the Lonkin:
        Prick the babe in the cradle,
        says Orange to him.
    93G.11  Rock well my cradle,
        and bee-ba my son;
        You shall have a new gown
        when the lord he comes home.
    93G.12  Still she did prick it,
        and bee-ba she cried:
        Come down, dearest mistress,
        and still your own child.
    93G.13  Oh still my child, Orange,
        still him with a bell:
        I cant still him, ladie,
        till you come down yoursell.
        * * * * *
    93G.14  Hold the gold basin,
        for your hearts blood to run in,
        . . . . .
        . . . . .
    93G.15  To hold the gold basin,
        it grieves me full sore;
        Oh kill me, dear Lonkin,
        and let my mother go.

### 93\[X\]: Lamkin


    93[X].1 Lamkin was as good a mason
        As ever liftit stane;
        He built to the laird o Lariston,
        But payment gat he nane.
    93[X.2] Oft he came, an ay he came,
        To that good lords yett,
        But neither at dor nor window
        Ony entrance could get.
    93[X.3] Till ae wae an weary day
        Early he came,
        An it fell out on that day
        That good lord was frae hame.
    93[X.4] He bade steek dor an window,
        An prick them to the gin,
        Nor leave a little wee hole,
        Else Lamkin wad be in.
    93[X.5] Noorice steekit dor an window,
        She steekit them to the gin;
        But she left a little wee hole
        That Lamkin might win in.
    93[X.6] O wheres the lady o this house?
        Said cruel Lamkin;
        Shes up the stair sleepin,
        Said fause noorice then.
    93[X.7] How will we get her down the stair?
        Said cruel Lamkin;
        Wel stogg the baby i the cradle,
        Said fause noorice then.
    93[X.8] He stoggit, and she rockit,
        Till a the floor swam,
        An a the tors o the cradle
        Red wi blude ran.
    93[X.9] O still my son, noorise,
        O still him wi the kane;
        He winna still, madam,
        Till Lariston come hame.
    93[X.10]    O still my son, noorice,
        O still him wi the knife;
        I canna still him, madam,
        If ye sude tak my life.
    93[X.11]    O still my soon, noorice,
        O still him wi the bell;
        He winna still, madam,
        Come see him yoursel.
    93[X.12]    Wae an weary rase she up,
        Slowly pat her on
        Her green claethin o the silk,
        An slowly came she down.
    93[X.13]    The first step she steppit,
        It was on a stone;
        The first body she saw
        Was cruel Lamkin.
    93[X.14]    O pity, pity, Lamkin,
        Hae pity on me!
        Just as meikle pity, madam,
        As ye paid me o my fee.
    93[X.15]    Ill g ye a peck o good red goud,
        Streekit wi the wand;
        An if that winna please ye,
        Ill heap it wi my hand.
    93[X.16]    An if that winna please ye,
        O goud an o fee,
        Ill g ye my eldest daughter,
        Your wedded wife to be.
    93[X.17]    Gae wash the bason, lady,
        Gae washt an mak it clean,
        To kep your mothers hearts-blude,
        For shes of noble kin.
    93[X.18]    To kep my mothers hearts-blude
        I wad be right wae;
        O tak mysle, Lamkin,
        An let my mother gae.
    93[X.19]    Gae wash the bason, noorice,
        Gae washt an mak it clean,
        To kep your ladys hearts-blude,
        For shes o noble kin.
    93[X.20]    To wash the bason, Lamkin,
        I will be right glad,
        For mony, mony bursen day
        About her house Ive had.
    93[X.21]    But oh, what dule an sorrow
        Was about that lords ha,
        When he fand his lady lyin
        As white as driven snaw!
    93[X.22]    O what dule an sorrow
        Whan that good lord cam in,
        An fand his young son murderd,
        I the chimley lyin!
