# 276A: The Friar in the Well


    276A.1   As I lay musing all alone,
         fa, la, la, la, la
         A pretty jeast I thought upon;
         fa, la, la, la, la
         Then listen a while, and I will you tell
         Of a fryer that loved a bonny lass well.
         fa, la, la, la, la
         fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly
    276A.2   He came to the maid when she went to bed,
         Desiring to have her maidenhead,
         But she deny d his desire,
         And told him that she feard hell-fire.
    276A.3   Tush, quoth the fryer, Thou needst not doubt
         If thou wert in hell I could sing thee out:
         Then, quoth the maid, Thou shalt have thy request;
         The fryer was glad as a fox in his nest.
    276A.4   But one thing, quoth she, I do desire,
         Before you have what you require;
         Before that you shall do the thing,
         An angel of mony thou shalt me bring.
    276A.5   Tush, quoth the fryer, we shall agree,
         No mony shall part my love and me;
         Before that I will see thee lack,
         Ile pawn the grey gown from my back.
    276A.6   The maid bethought her of a wile
         How she the fryer might bequile;
         While he was gone, the truth to tell,
         She hung a cloth before the well.
    276A.7   The fryer came, as his covenant was,
         With money to his bonny lass;
         Good morrow, fair maid! Good morrow! quoth she.
         Here is the mony I promised thee.
    276A.8   thankt the man, and she took his mony:
         Now let us go to t, quoth he, Sweet hony:
         O stay, quoth she, Some respite make,
         My father comes, he will me take.
    276A.9   Alas! quoth the fryer, where shall I run,
         To hide me till that he be gone?
         Behinde the cloath run thou, quoth she,
         And there my father cannot thee see.
    276A.10  Behind the cloath the fryer crept,
         And into the well on the sudden he leapt;
         Alas, quoth he, i am in the well!
         No matter, quoth she, if thou wert in hell.
    276A.11  Thou sayst thou couldst sing me out of hell,
         Now prithee sing thy self out of the well:
         The fryer sung with a pittiful sound,
         Oh help me out, or I shall be dround!
    276A.12  I trow, quoth she, your courage is coold.
         Quoth the fryer, I was never so foold,
         I never was serv d so before.
         Then take heed, quoth she, Thou comst there no more.
    276A.13  Quoth he, For sweet Saint Francis sake
         On his disciple some pitty take:
         Quoth she, Saint Francis never taught
         His scholars to tempt young maids to naught.
    276A.14  The fryer did entreat her still
         That she should help him out of the well;
         She heard him make such pittious moan
         She helpd him out, and bid him be gone.
    276A.15  Quoth he, Shall I have my mony again,
         Which thou from me hast beforehand tane?
         Good sir, said she, Theres no such matter;
         Ile make you pay for fouling my water.
    276A.16  The fryer went all along the street,
         Droping wet, like a new-washd sheep;
         Both old and young commended the maid
         That such a witty prank had plaid.

### 276B: The Friar in the Well


    276B.1   O HEARKEN and hear, and I will you tell
         Sing, Faldidae, faldidadi
         Of a friar that loved a fair maiden well.
         Sing, Faldi dadi di di (bis)
    276B.2   The friar he came to this maidens bedside,
         And asking for her maidenhead.
    276B.3   O I would grant you your desire,
         If twerena for fear o hells burning fire.
    276B.4   O hells burning fire ye need have no doubt;
         Altho you were in, I could whistle you out.
    276B.5   O if I grant to you this thing,
         Some money you unto me must bring.
    276B.6   He brought her the money, and did it down tell;
         She had a white cloth spread over the well.
    276B.7   Then the fair maid cried out that her master was come;
         O, said the friar, Then where shall I run?
    276B.8   O ye will go in behind yon screen,
         And then by my master ye winna be seen.
    276B.9   n in behind the screen she him sent.
         But he fell into the well by accident.
    276B.10  Then the friar cried out with a piteous moan,
         O help! O help me! or else I am gone.
    276B.11  Ye said ye wad whistle me out o hell;
         Now whistle your ain sel out o the well.
    276B.12  She helped him out and bade him be gone;
         The friar he asked his money again.
    276B.13  As for your money, there is no much matter
         To make you pay more for jumbling our water.
    276B.14  Then all who hear it commend this fair maid
         For the nimble trick to the friar she played.
    276B.15  friar he walked on the street,
         And shaking his lugs like a well-washen sheep.
