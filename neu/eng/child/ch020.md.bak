        And there she endurd much misery.
    20[O.5] She leant her back against an oak,
        With bitter sighs these words she spoke.
    20[O.6] She set her foot against a thorne,
        And there she had two pretty babes born.
    20[O.7] She took her filliting off her head,
        And there she tyd them hand and leg.
    20[O.8] She had a penknife long [and] sharp,
        And there she stuck them to the heart.
    20[O.9] She dug a grave, it was long and deep,
        And there she laid them in to sleep.
    20[O.10]    The coldest earth it was their bed,
        The green grass was their coverlid.
    20[O.11]    As she was a going by her fathers hall,
        She see three children a playing at ball.
    20[O.12]    One was drest in scarlet fine,
        And the other[s was naked] as ere they was born.
    20[O.13]    O mother, O mother, if these children was mine,
        I wold dress them [in] scarlet fine.
    20[O.14]    O mother, O mother, when we was thine,
        You did not dress [us] in scarlet fine.
    20[O.15]    You set your back against a tree,
        And there you endured great misery.
    20[O.16]    You set your foot against a thorne,
        And there you had us pritty babes born.
    20[O.17]    You took your filliting off your head,
        And there you bound us, hand to leg.
    20[O.18]    You had a penknife long and sharp,
        And there you stuck us to the heart.
    20[O.19]    You dug a grave, it was long and deep,
        And there you laid us in to sleep.
    20[O.20]    The coldest earth it was our bed,
        The green grass was our coverlid.
    20[O.21]    O mother, mother, for your sin
        Heaven-gate you shall not enter in.
    20[O.22]    O mother, mother, for your sin
        Hell-gates stands open to let you in.
    20[O.23]    The ladys cheeks lookd pale and wan,
        Alass I, said she, what have I done!
    20[O.24]    She tore her silken locks of hair,
        And dyd away in sad despair.
    20[O.25]    Young ladies all, of beauty bright,
        Take warning by her last good-night.
