269A.1	 THERE was a king, and a very great king,
	 And a king of meikle fame;
	 He had not a child in the world but ane,
	 Lady Daisy was her name.
269A.2	 He had a very bonnie kitchen-boy,
	 And William was his name;
	 He never lay out o Lady Daisy&#146;s bower,
	 Till he brought her body to shame.
269A.3	 When een-birds sung, and een-bells rung,
	 And a&#146; men were boune to rest,
	 The king went on to Lady Daisy&#146;s bower,
	 Just like a wandering ghaist.
269A.4	 He has drawn the curtains round and round,
	 And there he has sat him down;
	 &#145;To whom is this, Lady Daisy,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;That now you gae so round?
269A.5	 &#145;Is it to a laird? or is it to a lord?
	 Or a baron of high degree?
	 Or is it William, my bonnie kitchen-boy?
	 Tell now the truth to me.&#146;
269A.6	 &#145;It&#146;s no to a laird, and it&#146;s no to a lord,
	 Nor a baron of high degree;
	 But it&#146;s to William, your bonnie kitchen-boy:
	 What cause hae I to lee?&#146;
269A.7	 &#145;O where is all my merry, merry men,
	 That I pay meat and fee,
	 That they will not take out this kitchen-boy,
	 And kill him presentlie?&#146;
269A.8	 They hae taen out this bonnie kitchen-boy,
	 And killd him on the plain;
	 His hair was like the threads o gold,
	 His een like crystal stane;
	 His hair was like the threads o gold,
	 His teeth like ivory bane.
269A.9	 They hae taen out this bonnie boy&#146;s heart,
	 Put it in a cup o gold;
	 &#145;Take that to Lady Daisy,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;For she&#146;s impudent and bold;
	 And she washd it with the tears that ran from her eye
	 Into the cup of gold.
269A.10	 &#145;Now fare ye weel, my father the king!
	 You hae taen my earthly joy;
	 Since he&#146;s died for me, I&#146;ll die for him,
	 My bonnie kitchen-boy.&#146;
269A.11	 &#145;O where is all my merry, merry men,
	 That I pay meat and wage,
	 That they could not withold my cruel hand,
	 When I was mad with rage?
269A.12	 &#145;I think nae wonder, Lady Daisy,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;That he brought your body to shame;
	 For there never was man of woman born
	 Sae fair as him that is slain.&#146;

	 And a king of mickle fame,
	 And he had daughters only one,
	 Lady Dysmal was her name.
269C.2	 He had a boy, and a kitchen-boy,
	 A boy of mickle scorn,
	 And she lovd him lang, and she loved him aye,
	 Till the grass oergrew the corn.
269C.3	 When twenty weeks were gone and past,
	 O she began to greet!
	 Her petticoat grew short before,
	 And her stays they wadna meet.
269C.4	 It fell upon a winter&#146;s night
	 The king could get nae rest;
	 He cam unto his daughter dear,
	 Just like a wandring ghaist.
269C.5	 He cam into her bed-chalmer,
	 And drew the curtains round:
	 &#145;What aileth thee, my daughter dear?
	 I fear you&#146;ve gotten wrong.&#146;
269C.6	 &#145;O if I have, despise me not,
	 For he is all my joy;
	 I will forsake baith dukes and earls,
	 And marry your kitchen-boy.&#146;
269C.7	 &#145;Go call to me my merry men all,
	 By thirty and by three;
	 Go call to me my kitchen-boy,
	 We&#146;ll murder him secretlie.&#146;
269C.8	 There was nae din that could be heard,
	 And neer a word was said,
	 Till they got him baith fast and sure
	 Between twa feather-beds.
269C.9	 &#145;Go cut the heart out of his breast,
	 And put it in a cup of gold,
	 And present it to his Dysmal dear,
	 For she is baith stout and bold.&#146;
269C.10	 They&#146;ve cut the heart out of his breast,
	 And put it in a cup of gold,
	 And presented it to his Dysmal dear,
	 Who was baith stout and bold.
269C.11	 &#145;O come to me, my hinney, my heart,
	 O come to me, my joy!
	 O come to me, my hinney, my heart
	 My father&#146;s kitchen-boy!&#146;
269C.12	 She&#146;s taen the cup out of their hands,
	 And set it at her bed-head;
	 She washd it wi the tears that fell from her eyes,
	 And next morning she was dead.
269C.13	 &#145;O where were ye, my merry men all,
	 Whom I paid meat and wage,
	 Ye didna hold my cruel hand
	 When I was in my rage?
269C.14	 &#145;For gone is a&#146; my heart&#146;s delight,
	 And gone is a&#146; my joy;
	 For my dear Dysmal she is dead,
	 And so is my kitchen-boy.&#146;
