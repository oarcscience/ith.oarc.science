# 173A: Mary Hamilton


    173A.1   WORDRRrrS gane to the kitchen,
         And words gane to the ha,
         That Marie Hamilton gangs wi bairn
         To the hichest Stewart of a.
    173A.2   Hes courted her in the kitchen,
         Hes courted her in the ha,
         Hes courted her in the laigh cellar,
         And that was warst of a.
    173A.3   Shes tyed it in her apron
         And shes thrown it in the sea;
         Says, Sink ye, swim ye, bonny wee babe!
         Youl neer get mair o me.
    173A.4   Down them cam the auld queen,
         Goud tassels tying her hair:
         O marie, wheres the bonny wee babe
         That I heard greet sae sair?
    173A.5   There never was a babe intill my room,
         As little designs to be;
         It was but a touch o my sair side,
         Come oer my fair bodie.
    173A.6   O Marie, put on your robes o black,
         Or else your robes o brown,
         For ye maun gang wi me the night,
         To see fair Edinbro town.
    173A.7   I winna put on my robes o black,
         Nor yet my robes o brown;
         But Ill put on my robes o white,
         To shine through Edinbro town.
    173A.8   When she gaed up the Cannogate,
         She laughd loud laughters three;
         But whan she cam down the Cannogate
         The tear blinded her ee.
    173A.9   When she gaed up the Parliament stair,
         The heel cam aff her shee;
         And lang or she cam down again
         She was condemnd to dee.
    173A.10  When she cam down the Cannogate,
         The Cannogate sae free,
         Many a ladie lookd oer her window,
         Weeping for this ladie.
    173A.11  Ye need nae weep for me, she says,
         Ye need nae weep for me;
         For had I not slain mine own sweet babe,
         This death I wadna dee.
    173A.12  Bring me a bottle of wine, she says,
         The best that eer ye hae,
         That I may drink to my weil-wishers,
         And they may drink to me.
    173A.13  Heres a health to the jolly sailors,
         That sail upon the main;
         Let them never let on to my father and mother
         But what Im coming hame.
    173A.14  Heres a health to the jolly sailors,
         That sail upon the sea;
         Let them never let on to my father and mother
         That I cam here to dee.
    173A.15  Oh little did my mother think,
         The day she cradled me,
         What lands I was to travel through,
         What death I was to dee.
    173A.16  Oh little did my father think,
         The day he held up me,
         What lands I was to travel through,
         What death I was to dee.
    173A.17  Last night I washd the queens feet,
         And gently laid her down;
         And a the thanks Ive gotten the nicht
         To be hangd in Edinbro town!
    173A.18  Last nicht there was four Maries,
         The nicht therel be but three;
         There was Marie Seton, and Marie Beton,
         And Marie Carmichael, and me.

### 173B: Mary Hamilton


    173B.1   THERE were ladies, they lived in a bower,
         And oh but they were fair!
         The youngest o them is to the kings court,
         To learn some unco lair.
    173B.2   She hadna been in the kings court
         A twelve month and a day,
         Till of her they could get na wark,
         For wantonness and play.
    173B.3   Word is to the kitchen gane,
         And word is to the ha,
         And word is up to Madame the Queen,
         And that is warst of a,
         That Mary Hamilton has born a bairn,
         To the hichest Stewart of a.
    173B.4   O rise, O rise, Mary Hamilton,
         O rise, and tell to me
         What thou did with thy sweet babe
         We sair heard weep by thee.
    173B.5   Hold your tongue, madame, she said,
         And let your folly be;
         It was a shouir o sad sickness
         Made me weep sae bitterlie.
    173B.6   O rise, O rise, Mary Hamilton,
         O rise, and tell to me
         What thou did with thy sweet babe
         We sair heard weep by thee.
    173B.7   I put it in a piner-pig,
         And set it on the sea;
         I bade it sink, or it might swim,
         It should neer come hame to me.
    173B.8   O rise,O rise, Mary Hamilton,
         Arise, and go with me;
         There is a wedding in Glasgow town
         This day well go and see.
    173B.9   She put not on her black clothing,
         She put not on her brown,
         But she put on the glistering gold,
         To shine thro Edinburgh town.
    173B.10  As they came into Edinburgh town,
         The city for to see,
         The bailies wife and the provosts wife
         Said, Och an alace for thee!
    173B.11  Gie never alace for me, she said,
         Gie never alace for me;
         Its all for the sake of my poor babe,
         This death that I maun die.
    173B.12  As they gaed up the Tolbuith stair,
         The stair it was sae hie,
         The bailies son and the provosts son
         Said, Och an alace for thee!
    173B.13  Gie never alace for me, she said,
         Gie never alace for me!
         Its all for the sake of my puir babe,
         This death I maun die.
    173B.14  But bring to me a cup, she says,
         A cup bot and a can,
         And I will drink to all my friends,
         And theyll drink to me again.
    173B.15  res to you all, travellers,
         Who travels by land or sea;
         Let na wit to my father nor mother
         The death that I must die.
    173B.16  Heres to you all, travellers,
         That travels on dry land;
         Let na wit to my father nor mother
         But I am coming hame.
    173B.17  Little did my mother think,
         First time she cradled me,
         What land I was to travel on,
         Or what death I would die.
    173B.18  Little did my mother think,
         First time she tied my head,
         What land I was to tread upon,
         Or whare I would win my bread.
    173B.19  Yestreen Queen Mary had four Maries,
         This night shell hae but three;
         She had Mary Seaton, and Mary Beaton,
         And Mary Carmichael, and me.
    173B.20  Yestreen I wush Queen Marys feet,
         And bore her till her bed;
         This day shes given me my reward,
         This gallows-tree to tread.
    173B.21  Cast off, cast off my goun, she said,
         But let my petticoat be,
         And tye a napkin on my face,
         For that gallows I downa see.
    173B.22  By and cum the king himsell,
         Lookd up with a pitiful ee:
         Come down, come down, Mary Hamilton,
         This day thou wilt dine with me.
    173B.23  Hold your tongue, my sovereign leige,
         And let your folly be;
         An ye had a mind to save my life,
         Ye should na shamed me here.

### 173C: Mary Hamilton


    173C.1   THERE lived a lord into the west,
         And he had dochters three,
         And the youngest o them is to the kings court,
         To learn some courtesie.
    173C.2   She was not in the kings court
         A twelvemonth and a day,
         Till she was neither able to sit nor gang,
         Wi the gaining o some play.
    173C.3   She went to the garden,
         To pull the leaf aff the tree,
         To tak this bonnie babe frae her breast,
         But alas it would na do!
    173C.4   She rowed it in her handkerchief,
         And threw it in the sea:
         O sink ye, swim ye, wee wee babe!
         Yell get nae mair o me.
    173C.5   Word is to the kitchen gane,
         And word is to the ha,
         That Mary Myle she goes wi child
         To the highest Steward of a.
    173C.6   Down and came the queen hersell,
         The queen hersell so free:
         O mary Myle, whare is the child
         That I heard weep for thee?
    173C.7   O hold your tongue now, Queen, she says,
         O hold your tongue so free!
         For it was but a shower o the sharp sickness,
         I was almost like to die.
    173C.8   O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Myle,
         O busk, and go wi me;
         O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Mile,
         Its Edinburgh town to see.
    173C.9   Ill no put on my robes o black,
         No nor yet my robes [o] brown;
         But Ill put on my golden weed,
         To shine thro Edinburgh town.
    173C.10  When she went up the Cannongate-side,
         The Cannongate-side so free,
         Oh there she spied some ministers lads,
         Crying Och and alace for me!
    173C.11  Dinna cry och and alace for me!
         Dinna cry o[c]h and alace for me!
         For its all for the sake of my innocent babe
         That I come here to die.
    173C.12  When she went up the Tolbooth-stair,
         The lap cam aff her shoe;
         Before that she came down again,
         She was condemned to die.
    173C.13  O all you gallant sailors,
         That sail upon the sea,
         Let neither my father nor mother know
         The death I am to die!
    173C.14  O all you gallant sailors,
         That sail upon the faem,
         Let neither my father nor mother know
         But I am coming hame!
    173C.15  Little did my mother know,
         The hour that she bore me,
         What lands I was to travel in,
         What death I was to die.
    173C.16  Little did my father know,
         When he held up my head,
         What lands I was to travel in,
         What was to be my deid.
    173C.17  Yestreen I made Queen Marys bed,
         Kembed doun her yellow hair;
         Is this the reward I am to get,
         To tread this gallows-stair!

### 173D: Mary Hamilton


    173D.1   THERE lives a knight into the north,
         And he had daughters three;
         The ane of them was a barbers wife,
         The other a gay ladie.
    173D.2   And the youngest of them is to Scotland gane,
         The queens Mary to be,
         And a that they could say or do,
         Forbidden she woudna be.
    173D.3   The princes bed it was sae saft,
         The spices they were sae fine,
         That out of it she couldna lye
         While she was scarse fifteen.
    173D.4   Shes gane to the garden gay
         To pu of the savin tree;
         But for a that she could say or do,
         The babie it would not die.
    173D.5   Shes rowed it in her handkerchief,
         She threw it in the sea;
         Says, Sink ye, swim ye, my bonnie babe!
         For yell get nae mair of me.
    173D.6   Queen Mary came tripping down the stair,
         Wi the gold strings in her hair:
         O whares the little babie, she says,
         That I heard greet sae sair?
    173D.7   O hold your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame,
         Let all those words go free!
         It was mysell wi a fit o the sair colic,
         I was sick just like to die.
    173D.8   O hold your tongue, Mary Hamilton,
         Let all those words go free!
         O where is the little babie
         That I heard weep by thee?
    173D.9   I rowed it in my handkerchief,
         And threw it in the sea;
         I bade it sink, I bade it swim,
         It would get nae mair o me.
    173D.10  O wae be to thee, Marie Hamilton,
         And an ill deid may you die!
         For if ye had saved the babies life
         It might hae been an honour to thee.
    173D.11  Busk ye, busk ye, Marie Hamilton,
         O busk ye to be a bride!
         For I am going to Edinburgh toun,
         Your gay wedding to bide.
    173D.12  You must not put on your robes of black,
         Nor yet your robes of brown;
         But you must put on your yellow gold stuffs,
         To shine thro Edinburgh town.
    173D.13  I will not put on my robes of black,
         Nor yet my robes of brown;
         But I will put on my yellow gold stuffs,
         To shine thro Edinburgh town,
    173D.14  As she went up the Parliament Close,
         A riding on her horse,
         There she saw many a coblers lady,
         Sat greeting at the cross.
    173D.15  O what means a this greeting?
         Im sure its nae for me;
         For Im come this day to Edinburgh town
         Weel wedded for to be.
    173D.16  When she gaed up the Parliament stair,
         She gied loud lauchters three;
         But ere that she came down again,
         She was condemned to die.
    173D.17  O little did my mother think,
         The day she prinned my gown,
         That I was to come sae far frae hame
         To be hangid in Edinburgh town.
    173D.18  O whatll my poor father think,
         As he comes thro the town,
         To see the face of his Molly fair
         Hanging on the gallows-pin!
    173D.19  Heres a health to the marineres,
         That plough the raging main!
         Let neither my mother nor father know
         But Im coming hame again!
    173D.20  Heres a health to the sailors,
         That sail upon the sea!
         Let neither my mother nor father ken
         That I came here to die!
    173D.21  Yestreen the queen had four Maries,
         This night shell hae but three;
         There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton,
         And Mary Carmichael, and me.
    173D.22  O hald your tongue, Mary Hamilton,
         Let all those words go free!
         This night eer ye be hanged
         Ye shall gang hame wi me.
    173D.23  O hald your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame,
         Let all those words go free!
         For since I have come to Edinburgh toun,
         Its hanged I shall be,
         And it shall neer be said that in your court
         I was condemned to die.

### 173E: Mary Hamilton


    173E.1   MY father was the Duke of York,
         My mother a lady free,
         Mysell a dainty damsell,
         Queen Mary sent for me.
    173E.2   Yestreen I washd Queen Marys feet,
         Kamd down her yellow hair,
         And lay a night in the young mans bed,
         And Ill rue t for evermair.
    173E.3   The queens kale was aye sae het,
         Her spice was aye sae fell,
         Till they gart me gang to the young mans bed,
         And Id a the wyte mysell.
    173E.4   I was not in the queens service
         A twelvemonth but barely ane,
         Ere I grew as big wi bairn
         As ae woman could gang.
    173E.5   But it fell ance upon a day,
         Was aye to be it lane,
         I did take strong travilling
         As ever yet was seen.
    173E.6   Ben it came the queen hersell,
         Was a gowd to the hair;
         O wheres the bairn, Lady Maisry,
         That I heard greeting sair?
    173E.7   it came the queen hersell,
         Was a gowd to the chin:
         O wheres the bairn, Lady Maisry,
         That I heard late yestreen.
    173E.8   There is no bairn here, she says,
         Nor never thinks to be;
         Twas but a stoun of sair sickness
         That ye heard seizing me.
    173E.9   They sought it out, they sought it in,
         They sought it but and ben,
         But between the bolster and the bed
         They got the baby slain.
    173E.10  Come busk ye, busk ye, Lady Maisdry,
         Come busk, an go with me;
         For I will on to Edinburgh,
         And try the verity.
    173E.11  She woud not put on the black, the black,
         Nor yet wad she the brown,
         But the white silk and the red scarlet,
         That shind frae town to town.
    173E.12  As she gaed down thro Edinburgh town
         The burghers wives made meen,
         That sic a dainty damsel
         Sud ever hae died for sin.
    173E.13  Make never meen for me, she says,
    RRMrrake  never meen for me;
         Seek never grace frae a graceless face,
         For that yell never see.
    173E.14  As she gaed up the Tolbooth stair,
         A light laugh she did gie;
         But lang ere she came down again
         She was condemned to die.
    173E.15  A you that are in merchants-ships,
         And cross the roaring faem,
         Hae nae word to my father and mother,
         But that Im coming hame.
    173E.16  Hold your hands, ye justice o peace,
         Hold them a little while!
         For yonder comes my father and mother,
         Thats travelld mony a mile.
    173E.17  Gie me some o your gowd, parents,
         Some o your white monie,
         To save me frae the head o yon hill,
         Yon greenwood gallows-tree.
    173E.18  Yell get nane o our gowd, daughter,
         Nor nane o our white monie;
         For we hae travelld mony a mile,
         This day to see you die.

### 173F: Mary Hamilton


    173F.1   my father was the Duke of York,
         My mother a lady free,
         Mysel a dainty demosell,
         Queen Mary sent for me.
    173F.2   The queens meat, it was sae sweet,
         Her colthing was sae rare,
         It made me lang for Sweet Willies bed,
         An Ill rue it ever maer.
    173F.3   Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton,
         And Lady Livinston, three,
         Well never meet in Queen Marys bower,
         Now Maries tho ye be.
    173F.4   Queen Mary sat in her bower,
         Sewing her silver seam;
         She thought she heard a baby greet,
         But an a lady meen.
    173F.5   She threw her needle frae her,
         Her seam out of her hand,
         An  she is on to Lady Marys bower,
         As fast as she could gang.
    173F.6   Open your door, Lady Mary, she says,
         And lat me come in;
         For I hear baby greet,
         But an a lady meen.
    173F.7   There is na bab in my bower, madam,
         Nor never thinks to be,
         But the strong pains of gravel
         This night has seized me.
    173F.8   She pat her fit to the door,
         But an her knee,
         Baith of brass and iron bands
         In flinders she gard flee.
    173F.9   She pat a hand to her bed-head,
         An ither to her bed-feet,
         An bonny was the bab
         Was blabbering in its bleed.
    173F.10  Wae worth ye, Lady Mary,
         An ill dead sall ye die!
         For an ye widna kept the bonny bab,
         Ye might ha sent to me.
    173F.11  Lay na the wate on me, madam,

         For my fas love bare the brand at his side
         That gared my barrine die.

         And Lady Livinstone three,
         An we will on to Edinburgh,
         An try this gay lady.
    173F.13  As she came to the Cannongate,
         The burgers wives they cryed
         Hon ohon, ochree!  . .
         . . . .
    173F.14  O had you still, ye burgers wives,
         An make na meen for me;
         Seek never grace of a graceless face,
         For they hae nane to gie.
    173F.15  Ye merchants and ye mariners,
         That trade upon the sea,
         O dinna tell in my country
         The dead Im gaen to die!
    173F.16  Ye merchants and ye mariners,

         O dinna tell in my country
         But that Im comin hame!
    173F.17  Little did my father think,
         Whan he brought me our the sea,
         That he wad see me yellow locks
         Hang on a gallows tree.

         Then onie that were there.
    173G.2   Mary Hamiltons to the preaching gane,
         Wi ribbons on her breast;
         An the king thocht mair o Marie
         Than he thocht o the priest.
    173G.3   Syne word is thro the palace gane,
         I heard it tauld yestreen,
         The king loes Mary Hamilton
         Mair than he loes his queen.
    173G.4   A sad tale thro the town is gaen,
         A sad tale on the morrow;
         Oh Mary Hamilton has born a babe,
         An slain it in her sorrow!
    173G.5   And down then cam the auld queen,
         Goud tassels tied her hair:
         What did ye wi the wee wee bairn
         That I heard greet sae sair?
    173G.6   There neer was a bairn into my room,
         An as little designs to be;
         Twas but a stitch o my sair side,
         Cam owre my fair bodie.
    173G.7   Rise up now, Marie, quo the queen,
         Rise up, an come wi me,
         For we maun ride to Holyrood,
         A gay wedding to see.
    173G.8   The queen was drest in scarlet fine,
         Her maidens all in green;
         An every town that they cam thro
         Took Marie for the queen.
    173G.9   But little wist Marie Hamilton,
         As she rode oure the lea,
         That she was gaun to Edinbro town
         Her doom to hear and dree.
    173G.10  When she cam to the Netherbow Port,
         She laughed loud laughters three;
         But when she reached the gallows-tree,
         The tears blinded her ee.
    173G.11  Oh aften have I dressed my queen,
         An put gowd in her hair;

         That sail upon the sea!
         Oh never let on to my father and mither
         The death that I maun dee!
    173G.14  An I charge ye, all ye mariners,
         When ye sail owre the main,
         Let neither my father nor mither know
         But that Im comin hame.
    173G.15  Oh little did my mither ken,
         That day she cradled me,
         What lands I was to tread in,
         Or what death I should dee.
    173G.16  Yestreen the queen had four Maries,
         The nicht shell hae but three;
         Theres Marie Seaton, an Marie Beaton,

### 173H: Mary Hamilton


    173H.1   WHAN I was a babe, and a very little babe,
         And stood at my mithers knee,
         Nae witch nor warlock did unfauld

    173H.2   But my mither was a proud woman,
         A proud woman and a bauld;
         And she hired me to Queen Marys bouer,
         When scarce eleven years auld.
    173H.3   O happy, happy is the maid,
         Thats born of beauty free!
         It was my dimpling rosy cheeks
         Thats been the dule o me;
         And wae be to that weirdless wicht,
         And a his witcherie!
    173H.4   Words gane up and words gane doun,
         An words gane to the ha,
         That Mary Hamilton was wi bairn,
         An na body kend to wha.
    173H.5   But in and cam the queen hersel,
         Wi gowd plait on her hair:
         Says, Mary Hamilton, whare is the babe
         That I heard greet sae sair?
    173H.6   There is na babe within my bouer,
         And I hope there neer will be;
         But its me wi a sair and sick colic,

    173H.7   But they looked up, they looked down,
         Atween the bowsters and the wa,
         Its there they got a bonnie lad-bairn,
         But its life it was awa.
    173H.8   Rise up, rise up, Mary Hamilton,
         Rise up, and dress ye fine,
         For you maun gang to Edinbruch,
         And stand afore the nine.
    173H.9   Yell no put on the dowie black,
         Nor yet the dowie brown;

    173H.11  As they gaed thro Edinbruch town,
         And down by the Nether-bow,
         There war monie a lady fair
         Siching and crying, Och how!
    173H.12  O weep nae mair for me, ladies,

         Yestreen I killed my ain bairn,

         What need ye how for me?
         Ye never saw grace at a graceless face,
         Queen Mary has nane to gie.
    173H.14  Gae forward, gae forward, the queen she said,
         Gae forward, that ye may see;
         For the very same words that ye hae said
         Sall hang ye on the gallows-tree.
    173H.15  As she gaed up the Tolbooth stairs,
         She gied loud lauchters three;
         But or ever she cam down again,
         She was condemnd to dee.
    173H.16  O tak example frae me, Maries,

### 173I: Mary Hamilton


    173I.1   MARIE HAMILTONs to the kirk gane,

         Than ony that were there.
    173I.2   Marie Hamiltons to the kirk gane,

         Then he listend to the priest.
    173I.3   Marie Hamiltons to the kirk gane,
         Wi gloves upon her hands;
         The king thought mair o Marie Hamilton,
         Than the queen and a her lands.
    173I.4   She hadna been about the kings court
         A month, but barely one,
      Till she was beloved by a the kings court,
         And the king the only man.
    173I.5   She hadna been about the kings court
         A month, but barely three,
         Till frae the kings court Marie Hamilton,
         Marie Hamilton durstna be.
    173I.6   The king is to the Abbey gane,
         To pu the Abbey-tree,
         To scale the babe frae Maries heart,
         But the thing it wadna be.
    173I.7   O she has rowd it in her apron,
         And set it on the sea:
         Gae sink ye, or swim ye, bonny babe!
         Yes get nae mair o me.
    173I.8   Word is to the kitchen gane,

         And the bonny babes mist and awa.
    173I.9   Scarcely had she lain down again,
         And scarcely faen asleep,
         When up then started our gude queen,
         Just at her bed-feet,
         Saying, Marie Hamilton, wheres your babe?
         For I am sure I heard it greet.
    173I.10  O no, O no, my noble queen,
         Think no such thing to be!
         Twas but a stitch into my side,
         And sair it troubles me.
    173I.11  Get up, get up, Marie Hamilton,
         Get up and follow me;
         For I am going to Edinburgh town,
         A rich wedding for to see.
    173I.12  O slowly, slowly raise she up,
         And slowly put she on,
         And slowly rode she out the way,
         Wi mony a weary groan.
    173I.13  The queen was clad in scarlet,
         Her merry maids  all in green,
         And every town that they cam to,
         They took Marie for the queen.
    173I.14  Ride hooly, hooly, gentlemen,
         Ride hooly now wi me!
         For never, I am sure,  a wearier burd
         Rade in your cumpanie.
    173I.15  But little wist Marie Hamilton,
         When she rade on the brown,
         That she was gaen to Edinburgh town,
         And a to be put down.
    173I.16  Why weep ye so, ye burgess-wives,
         Why look ye so on me?

         A rich wedding for to see!
    173I.17  When she gaed up the Tolbooth stairs,
         The corks frae her heels did flee;
         And lang or eer she cam down again
         She was condemnd to die.
    173I.18  When she cam to the Netherbow Port,
         She laughed loud laughters three;
         But when she cam to the gallows-foot,
         The tears blinded her ee.

         And my bold brethren three,
         O mickle wad be the gude red blude
         This day wad be spilt for me!

    173[W.2]    Queen Marys bread it was sae white,
         And her wine it ran sae clear,
         It shewed her the way to the butlers bed,
