# LIST OF THE PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS

### OF ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH BALLADS AND SONGS.

\[This list does not include (excepting a few reprints) the collections
of Songs, Madrigals, "Ballets," &c., published in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries,--the titles of most of which are to be seen in
Rimbault's *Bibliotheca Madrigaliana*. On the other hand, it does
include a few useful books connected with ballad-poetry which would not
properly come into a list of collections. The relative importance of the
works in this list is partially indicated by difference of type. When
two or more editions are mentioned, those used in this collection are
distinguished by brackets. A few books which we have not succeeded in
finding--all of slight or no importance--are marked with a star.\]
