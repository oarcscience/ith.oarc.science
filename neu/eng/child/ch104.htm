<PRE>

104A.1	LADY MARGERY MAY sits in her bower,
	Sewing at her seem;
	By there comes a heathen knight,
	From her her maidenhead has tane.
104A.2	He has put her in a tower strong,
	With double locks on fifty doors:
	&#145;Lady Margery May, will you ga now?&#146;
	&#145;O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.
104A.3	&#145;I am asking, you heathen knight;
	What I am asking will you grant to me?
	Will ye let one of your waitmen
	A drink of your well bring to me?&#146;
104A.4	&#145;Meat nor drink you shall never get,
	Nor out of that shall you never come,
	Meat nor drink shall you never get,
	Until you bear to me daughter or son.&#146;
104A.5	Thus time drew on, and further on,
	For travail came this young lady to;
	She travailed up, so did she down,
	But lighter could she never be.
104A.6	&#145;An asking, an asking, you heathen knight;
	An asking will you grant to me?
	Will you give me a scread of silk,
	For to row your young son wi?&#146;
104A.7	He took the horse-sheet in his hand,
	The tears came twinkling down:
	&#145;Lady Margaret May, will ye ga now?&#146;
	&#145;O ye heathen knight, not yet for you.&#146;
104A.8	&#145;I&#146;ll wash my young son with the milk,
	I will dry my young son with the silk;
	For hearts will break, and bands will bow;
	So dear will I love my lady now!&#146;

104B.1	LADY MARGARET sat in her bower-door,
	Sewing at her silken seem,
	When by it came Prince Heathen then,
	An gae to her a gay gold ring.
104B.2	He turnd about, an gied a bow;
	She said, Begone, I love na you;
	When he sware by his yellow hair
	That he woud gar her greet fu sair.
104B.3	But she sware by her milk-white skin
	Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane:
	But she sware by her milk-white skin
	Prince Heathen shoud gar her greet nane:
      Refrain:	&#145;O bonny may, winna ye greet now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.
104B.4	He&#146;s taen her in his arms twa,
	Laid her between him an the wa,
	An ere he let her free again,
	Her maidenhead frae her he&#146;s taen.
      Refrain:	&#145;O bonny may, winna ye greet now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.&#146;
104B.5	&#145;I killd your father in his bed,
	And your gay mother by his side,
	And your seven brothers, ane by ane,
	And they were seven pretty men.
      Refrain:	O bonny may, winna ye greet now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.&#146;
104B.6	&#145;I&#146;ll put you in a vault o stone,
	Where five an thirty locks hing on;
	Naebody there then shall you see,
	For I will keep the keys wi me.
      Refrain:	O bonny may, winna ye greet now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, nae yet for you.&#146;
104B.7	&#145;He&#146;s put her in a vault o stone,
	Where five an thirty locks hing on;
	Naebody there coud eer her see,
	Prince Heathen kept the keys him wi.
      Refrain:	But ae she cried, What shall I do!
	The heathenish dog has gart me rue.
104B.8	Prince heathen from the mountains came,
	Attended by his armed men,
	And he&#146;s gane to the bonny may,
	And to the prison where she lay:
      Refrain:	&#145;O bonny may, what do you now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.&#146;
104B.9	&#145;I&#146;ll take you out upon the green,
	Where women ye shall neer see ane,
	But only me and my young men,
	Till ye bring daughter hame or son.
      Refrain:	O bonny may, what do you now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.&#146;
104B.10	He&#146;s taen her out upon the green,
	Where she saw women never ane,
	But only him and &#146;s merry young men,
	Till she brought hame a bonny young son.
      Refrain:	&#145;O bonny may, what do you now?&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, dying for you.
104B.11	&#145;A drink, a drink, frae Prince Heathen&#146;s hand,
	Though it were frae yon cauld well strong!&#146;
	&#145;O neer a drap, Prince Heathen,&#146; said one,
	&#145;Till ye row up your bonny young son.&#146;
	&#145;How can I row up my bonny young son.&#146;
	When I hae naething to row him in?&#146;
104B.12	&#145;I will lend you my horse&#146;s sheet,
	That will row him baith head and feet.&#146;
	As soon&#146;s she took it in her han,
	Tears oer her cheeks down rapping ran.
      Refrain:	&#145;O bonny may, ye do greet now:&#146;
	&#145;Ye heathenish dog, but nae for you.
104B.13	&#145;But a&#146; is for my bonny young son;
	Your sheets are rough to row him in;
	Ohon, alas, sair may I rue
	That eer I saw such rogues as you!&#146;
104B.14	&#145;Ye&#146;ll row my young son in the silk,
	An ye will wash him wi the milk,
	An lay my lady very saft,
	That I may see her very aft.&#146;
	When hearts are broken, bands will bow;
	Sae well&#146;s he loved his lady now!
