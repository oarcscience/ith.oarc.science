173A.1	 WORDRR&#146;rrS gane to the kitchen,
	 And word&#146;s gane to the ha,
	 That Marie Hamilton gangs wi bairn
	 To the hichest Stewart of a&#146;.
173A.2	 He&#146;s courted her in the kitchen,
	 He&#146;s courted her in the ha,
	 He&#146;s courted her in the laigh cellar,
	 And that was warst of a&#146;.
173A.3	 She&#146;s tyed it in her apron
	 And she&#146;s thrown it in the sea;
	 Says, Sink ye, swim ye, bonny wee babe!
	 You&#146;l neer get mair o me.
173A.4	 Down them cam the auld queen,
	 Goud tassels tying her hair:
	 &#145;O marie, where&#146;s the bonny wee babe
	 That I heard greet sae sair?&#146;
173A.5	 &#145;There never was a babe intill my room,
	 As little designs to be;
	 It was but a touch o my sair side,
	 Come oer my fair bodie.&#146;
173A.6	 &#145;O Marie, put on your robes o black,
	 Or else your robes o brown,
	 For ye maun gang wi me the night,
	 To see fair Edinbro town.&#146;
173A.7	 &#145;I winna put on my robes o black,
	 Nor yet my robes o brown;
	 But I&#146;ll put on my robes o white,
	 To shine through Edinbro town.&#146;
173A.8	 When she gaed up the Cannogate,
	 She laughd loud laughters three;
	 But whan she cam down the Cannogate
	 The tear blinded her ee.
173A.9	 When she gaed up the Parliament stair,
	 The heel cam aff her shee;
	 And lang or she cam down again
	 She was condemnd to dee.
173A.10	 When she cam down the Cannogate,
	 The Cannogate sae free,
	 Many a ladie lookd oer her window,
	 Weeping for this ladie.
173A.11	 &#145;Ye need nae weep for me,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;Ye need nae weep for me;
	 For had I not slain mine own sweet babe,
	 This death I wadna dee.
173A.12	 &#145;Bring me a bottle of wine,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;The best that eer ye hae,
	 That I may drink to my weil-wishers,
	 And they may drink to me.
173A.13	 &#145;Here&#146;s a health to the jolly sailors,
	 That sail upon the main;
	 Let them never let on to my father and mother
	 But what I&#146;m coming hame.
173A.14	 &#145;Here&#146;s a health to the jolly sailors,
	 That sail upon the sea;
	 Let them never let on to my father and mother

173A.15	 &#145;Oh little did my mother think,
	 The day she cradled me,
	 What lands I was to travel through,
	 What death I was to dee.
173A.16	 &#145;Oh little did my father think,
	 The day he held up me,
	 What lands I was to travel through,
	 What death I was to dee.
173A.17	 &#145;Last night I washd the queen&#146;s feet,
	 And gently laid her down;
	 And a&#146; the thanks I&#146;ve gotten the nicht
	 To be hangd in Edinbro town!
173A.18	 &#145;Last nicht there was four Maries,
	 The nicht there&#146;l be but three;

	 And Marie Carmichael, and me.&#146;

173B.1	 THERE were ladies, they lived in a bower,
	 And oh but they were fair!
	 The youngest o them is to the king&#146;s court,
	 To learn some unco lair.
173B.2	 She hadna been in the king&#146;s court
	 A twelve month and a day,
	 Till of her they could get na wark,
	 For wantonness and play.
173B.3	 Word is to the kitchen gane,
	 And word is to the ha,
	 And word is up to Madame the Queen,
	 And that is warst of a&#146;,
	 That Mary Hamilton has born a bairn,
	 To the hichest Stewart of a&#146;.
173B.4	 &#145;O rise, O rise, Mary Hamilton,
	 O rise, and tell to me
	 What thou did with thy sweet babe
	 We sair heard weep by thee.&#146;
173B.5	 &#145;Hold your tongue, madame,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;And let your folly be;
	 It was a shouir o sad sickness
	 Made me weep sae bitterlie.&#146;
173B.6	 &#145;O rise, O rise, Mary Hamilton,
	 O rise, and tell to me
	 What thou did with thy sweet babe
	 We sair heard weep by thee.&#146;
173B.7	 &#145;I put it in a piner-pig,
	 And set it on the sea;
	 I bade it sink, or it might swim,
	 It should neer come hame to me.&#146;
173B.8	 &#145;O rise,O rise, Mary Hamilton,
	 Arise, and go with me;
	 There is a wedding in Glasgow town
	 This day we&#146;ll go and see.&#146;
173B.9	 She put not on her black clothing,
	 She put not on her brown,
	 But she put on the glistering gold,
	 To shine thro Edinburgh town.
173B.10	 As they came into Edinburgh town,
	 The city for to see,
	 The bailie&#146;s wife and the provost&#146;s wife
	 Said, Och an alace for thee!
173B.11	 Gie never alace for me,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Gie never alace for me;
	 It&#146;s all for the sake of my poor babe,
	 This death that I maun die.&#146;
173B.12	 As they gaed up the Tolbuith stair,
	 The stair it was sae hie,
	 The bailie&#146;s son and the provost&#146;s son
	 Said, Och an alace for thee!
173B.13	 &#145;Gie never alace for me,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Gie never alace for me!
	 It&#146;s all for the sake of my puir babe,
	 This death I maun die.
173B.14	 &#145;But bring to me a cup,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;A cup bot and a can,
	 And I will drink to all my friends,
	 And they&#146;ll drink to me again.
173B.15	 re&#146;s to you all, travellers,
	 Who travels by land or sea;
	 Let na wit to my father nor mother
	 The death that I must die.
173B.16	 &#145;Here&#146;s to you all, travellers,
	 That travels on dry land;
	 Let na wit to my father nor mother
	 But I am coming hame.
173B.17	 &#145;Little did my mother think,
	 First time she cradled me,
	 What land I was to travel on,
	 Or what death I would die.
173B.18	 &#145;Little did my mother think,
	 First time she tied my head,
	 What land I was to tread upon,
	 Or whare I would win my bread.
173B.19	 &#145;Yestreen Queen Mary had four Maries,
	 This night she&#146;ll hae but three;
	 She had Mary Seaton, and Mary Beaton,
	 And Mary Carmichael, and me.
173B.20	 &#145;Yestreen I wush Queen Mary&#146;s feet,
	 And bore her till her bed;
	 This day she&#146;s given me my reward,
	 This gallows-tree to tread.
173B.21	 &#145;Cast off, cast off my goun,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;But let my petticoat be,
	 And tye a napkin on my face,
	 For that gallows I downa see.&#146;
173B.22	 By and cum the king himsell,
	 Lookd up with a pitiful ee:
	 &#145;Come down, come down, Mary Hamilton,
	 This day thou wilt dine with me.&#146;
173B.23	 &#145;Hold your tongue, my sovereign leige,
	 And let your folly be;
	 An ye had a mind to save my life,
	 Ye should na shamed me here.&#146;

173C.1	 THERE lived a lord into the west,
	 And he had dochters three,
	 And the youngest o them is to the king&#146;s court,
	 To learn some courtesie.
173C.2	 She was not in the king&#146;s court
	 A twelvemonth and a day,
	 Till she was neither able to sit nor gang,
	 Wi the gaining o some play.
173C.3	 She went to the garden,
	 To pull the leaf aff the tree,
	 To tak this bonnie babe frae her breast,
	 But alas it would na do!
173C.4	 She rowed it in her handkerchief,
	 And threw it in the sea:
	 &#145;O sink ye, swim ye, wee wee babe!
	 Ye&#146;ll get nae mair o me.&#146;
173C.5	 Word is to the kitchen gane,
	 And word is to the ha,
	 That Mary Myle she goes wi child
	 To the highest Steward of a&#146;.
173C.6	 Down and came the queen hersell,
	 The queen hersell so free:
	 &#145;O mary Myle, whare is the child
	 That I heard weep for thee?&#146;
173C.7	 &#145;O hold your tongue now, Queen,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;O hold your tongue so free!
	 For it was but a shower o the sharp sickness,
	 I was almost like to die.&#146;
173C.8	 &#145;O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Myle,
	 O busk, and go wi me;
	 O busk ye, busk ye, Mary Mile,
	 It&#146;s Edinburgh town to see.&#146;
173C.9	 &#145;I&#146;ll no put on my robes o black,
	 No nor yet my robes [o] brown;
	 But I&#146;ll put on my golden weed,
	 To shine thro Edinburgh town.&#146;
173C.10	 When she went up the Cannongate-side,
	 The Cannongate-side so free,
	 Oh there she spied some ministers&#146; lads,
	 Crying Och and alace for me!
173C.11	 &#145;Dinna cry och and alace for me!
	 Dinna cry o[c]h and alace for me!
	 For it&#146;s all for the sake of my innocent babe
	 That I come here to die.&#146;
173C.12	 When she went up the Tolbooth-stair,
	 The lap cam aff her shoe;
	 Before that she came down again,
	 She was condemned to die.
173C.13	 &#145;O all you gallant sailors,
	 That sail upon the sea,
	 Let neither my father nor mother know
	 The death I am to die!
173C.14	 &#145;O all you gallant sailors,
	 That sail upon the faem,
	 Let neither my father nor mother know
	 But I am coming hame!
173C.15	 &#145;Little did my mother know,
	 The hour that she bore me,
	 What lands I was to travel in,
	 What death I was to die.
173C.16	 &#145;Little did my father know,
	 When he held up my head,
	 What lands I was to travel in,
	 What was to be my deid.
173C.17	 &#145;Yestreen I made Queen Mary&#146;s bed,
	 Kembed doun her yellow hair;
	 Is this the reward I am to get,
	 To tread this gallows-stair!&#146;

173D.1	 THERE lives a knight into the north,
	 And he had daughters three;
	 The ane of them was a barber&#146;s wife,
	 The other a gay ladie.
173D.2	 And the youngest of them is to Scotland gane,
	 The queen&#146;s Mary to be,
	 And a&#146; that they could say or do,
	 Forbidden she woudna be.
173D.3	 The prince&#146;s bed it was sae saft,
	 The spices they were sae fine,
	 That out of it she couldna lye
	 While she was scarse fifteen.
173D.4	 She&#146;s gane to the garden gay
	 To pu of the savin tree;
	 But for a&#146; that she could say or do,
	 The babie it would not die.
173D.5	 She&#146;s rowed it in her handkerchief,
	 She threw it in the sea;
	 Says, Sink ye, swim ye, my bonnie babe!
	 For ye&#146;ll get nae mair of me.
173D.6	 Queen Mary came tripping down the stair,
	 Wi the gold strings in her hair:
	 &#145;O whare&#146;s the little babie,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;That I heard greet sae sair?&#146;
173D.7	 &#145;O hold your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame,
	 Let all those words go free!
	 It was mysell wi a fit o the sair colic,
	 I was sick just like to die.&#146;
173D.8	 &#145;O hold your tongue, Mary Hamilton,
	 Let all those words go free!
	 O where is the little babie
	 That I heard weep by thee?&#146;
173D.9	 &#145;I rowed it in my handkerchief,
	 And threw it in the sea;
	 I bade it sink, I bade it swim,
	 It would get nae mair o me.&#146;
173D.10	 &#145;O wae be to thee, Marie Hamilton,
	 And an ill deid may you die!
	 For if ye had saved the babie&#146;s life
	 It might hae been an honour to thee.
173D.11	 &#145;Busk ye, busk ye, Marie Hamilton,
	 O busk ye to be a bride!
	 For I am going to Edinburgh toun,
	 Your gay wedding to bide.
173D.12	 &#145;You must not put on your robes of black,
	 Nor yet your robes of brown;
	 But you must put on your yellow gold stuffs,
	 To shine thro Edinburgh town.&#146;
173D.13	 &#145;I will not put on my robes of black,
	 Nor yet my robes of brown;
	 But I will put on my yellow gold stuffs,
	 To shine thro Edinburgh town,&#146;
173D.14	 As she went up the Parliament Close,
	 A riding on her horse,
	 There she saw many a cobler&#146;s lady,
	 Sat greeting at the cross.
173D.15	 &#145;O what means a&#146; this greeting?
	 I&#146;m sure its nae for me;
	 For I&#146;m come this day to Edinburgh town
	 Weel wedded for to be.&#146;
173D.16	 When she gaed up the Parliament stair,
	 She gied loud lauchters three;
	 But ere that she came down again,
	 She was condemned to die.
173D.17	 &#145;O little did my mother think,
	 The day she prinned my gown,
	 That I was to come sae far frae hame
	 To be hangid in Edinburgh town.
173D.18	 &#145;O what&#146;ll my poor father think,
	 As he comes thro the town,
	 To see the face of his Molly fair
	 Hanging on the gallows-pin!
173D.19	 &#145;Here&#146;s a health to the marineres,
	 That plough the raging main!
	 Let neither my mother nor father know
	 But I&#146;m coming hame again!
173D.20	 &#145;Here&#146;s a health to the sailors,
	 That sail upon the sea!
	 Let neither my mother nor father ken
	 That I came here to die!
173D.21	 &#145;Yestreen the queen had four Maries,
	 This night she&#146;ll hae but three;
	 There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton,
	 And Mary Carmichael, and me.&#146;
173D.22	 &#145;O hald your tongue, Mary Hamilton,
	 Let all those words go free!
	 This night eer ye be hanged
	 Ye shall gang hame wi me.&#146;
173D.23	 &#145;O hald your tongue, Queen Mary, my dame,
	 Let all those words go free!
	 For since I have come to Edinburgh toun,
	 It&#146;s hanged I shall be,
	 And it shall neer be said that in your court
	 I was condemned to die.&#146;

173E.1	 &#145;MY father was the Duke of York,
	 My mother a lady free,
	 Mysell a dainty damsell,
	 Queen Mary sent for me.
173E.2	 &#145;Yestreen I washd Queen Mary&#146;s feet,
	 Kam&#146;d down her yellow hair,
	 And lay a&#146; night in the young man&#146;s bed,
	 And I&#146;ll rue t for evermair.
173E.3	 &#145;The queen&#146;s kale was aye sae het,
	 Her spice was aye sae fell,
	 Till they gart me gang to the young man&#146;s bed,
	 And I&#146;d a&#146; the wyte mysell.
173E.4	 &#145;I was not in the queen&#146;s service
	 A twelvemonth but barely ane,
	 Ere I grew as big wi bairn
	 As ae woman could gang.
173E.5	 &#145;But it fell ance upon a day,
	 Was aye to be it lane,
	 I did take strong travilling
	 As ever yet was seen.&#146;
173E.6	 Ben it came the queen hersell,
	 Was a&#146; gowd to the hair;
	 &#145;O where&#146;s the bairn, Lady Maisry,
	 That I heard greeting sair?&#146;
173E.7	 it came the queen hersell,
	 Was a&#146; gowd to the chin:
	 &#145;O where&#146;s the bairn, Lady Maisry,
	 That I heard late yestreen.&#146;
173E.8	 &#145;There is no bairn here,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;Nor never thinks to be;
	 &#146;Twas but a stoun of sair sickness
	 That ye heard seizing me.&#146;
173E.9	 They sought it out, they sought it in,
	 They sought it but and ben,
	 But between the bolster and the bed
	 They got the baby slain.
173E.10	 &#145;Come busk ye, busk ye, Lady Maisdry,
	 Come busk, an go with me;
	 For I will on to Edinburgh,
	 And try the verity.&#146;
173E.11	 She woud not put on the black, the black,
	 Nor yet wad she the brown,
	 But the white silk and the red scarlet,
	 That shin&#146;d frae town to town.
173E.12	 As she gaed down thro Edinburgh town
	 The burghers&#146; wives made meen,
	 That sic a dainty damsel
	 Sud ever hae died for sin.
173E.13	 Make never meen for me,&#146; she says,
RR&#146;Mrrake	never meen for me;
	 Seek never grace frae a graceless face,
	 For that ye&#146;ll never see.&#146;
173E.14	 As she gaed up the Tolbooth stair,
	 A light laugh she did gie;
	 But lang ere she came down again
	 She was condemned to die.
173E.15	 &#145;A&#146; you that are in merchants-ships,
	 And cross the roaring faem,
	 Hae nae word to my father and mother,
	 But that I&#146;m coming hame.
173E.16	 &#145;Hold your hands, ye justice o peace,
	 Hold them a little while!
	 For yonder comes my father and mother,
	 That&#146;s travelld mony a mile.
173E.17	 &#145;Gie me some o your gowd, parents,
	 Some o your white monie,
	 To save me frae the head o yon hill,
	 Yon greenwood gallows-tree.&#146;
173E.18	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll get nane o our gowd, daughter,
	 Nor nane o our white monie;
	 For we hae travelld mony a mile,
	 This day to see you die.&#146;
173E.19	 &#145;Hold your hands, ye justice o peace,
	 Hold them a little while!
	 For yonder comes him Warenston,
	 The father of my chile.

	 And nurse it carefullie,
	 And gowd shoud been your hire, Maisry,
	 And my body your fee.&#146;
173E.22	 He&#146;s taen out a purse o gowd,

173[Aa].1	Oft hae I kaimd Queen Mary&#146;s head,
	 An oft hae I curld her hair,
	 An now I hae gotten for my reward
	 A gallows to be heir.&#146;

173[Bb].1	Yestreen the queen had four Maries,
	 But the nicht she&#146;ll hae but three;
	 There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton,
	 And Mary Carmichell, and me.
173[Bb.2]	Oh little did my mither think,
	 At nicht when she cradled me,
	 That I wad sleep in a nameless grave
	 And hang on the gallows-tree.
	 Yestreen, etc.
173[Bb.3]	They&#146;ll tie a kerchief round my een,
	 And they&#146;ll na let me see t&#146; dee,
	 And they&#146;ll spread my story thro a&#146; the land,
	 Till it reaches my ain countrie.
173[Bb.4]	I wish I micht sleep in the auld kirkyard,
	 Beneath the hazel tree,
	 Where aft we played in the long simmer nichts,
	 My brithers and sisters and me.
