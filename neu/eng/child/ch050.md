# 50: The Bonny Hind


    50.1    O MAY she comes, and may she goes,
        Down by yon gardens green,
        And there she spied a gallant squire
        As squire had ever been.
    50.2    And may she comes, and may she goes,
        Down by yon hollin tree,
        And there she spied a brisk young squire,
        And a brisk young squire was he.
    50.3    Give me your green manteel, fair maid,
        Give me your maidenhead;
        Gif ye winna gie me your green manteel,
        Gi me your maidenhead.
    50.4    He has taen her by the milk-white hand,
        And softly laid her down,
        And when hes lifted her up again
        Given her a silver kaim.
    50.5    Perhaps there may be bairns, kind sir,
        Perhaps there may be nane;
        But if you be a courtier,
        Youll tell to me your name.
    50.6    I am nae courtier, fair maid,
        But new come frae the sea;
        I am nae courtier, fair maid,
        But when I courtith thee.
    50.7    They call me Jack when Im abroad,
        Sometimes they call me John;
        But when Im in my fathers bower
        Jock Randal is my name.
    50.8    Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny lad,
        Sae louds I hear ye lee!
        Ffor Im Lord Randals yae daughter,
        He has nae mair nor me.
    50.9    Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny may,
        Sae louds I hear ye lee!
        For Im Lord Randals yae yae son,
        Just now come oer the sea.
    50.10   Shes putten her hand down by her spare,
        And out shes taen a knife,
        And she has putnt in her hearts bluid,
        And taen away her life.
    50.11   And hes taen up his bonny sister,
        With the big tear in his een,
        And he has buried his bonny sister
        Amang the hollins green.
    50.12   And syne hes hyed him oer the dale,
        His father dear to see:
        Sing O and O for my bonny hind,
        Beneath yon hollin tree!
    50.13   1 What needs you care for your bonny hyn?
        For it you needna care;
        Theres aught score hyns in yonder park,
        And five score hyns to spare.
    50.14   Four score of them are siller-shod,
        Of thae ye may get three;
        But O and O for my bonny hyn,
        Beneath yon hollin tree!
    50.15   What needs you care for your bonny hyn?
        For it you need na care;
        Take you the best, gi me the warst,
        Since plenty is to spare.
    50.16   I care na for your hyns, my lord,
        I care na for your fee;
        But O and O for my bonny hyn,
        Beneath the hollin tree!
    50.17   O were ye at your sisters bower,
        Your sister fair to see,
        Yell think na mair o your bonny hyn
        Beneath the hollin tree.
