    66A.1   LORD INGRAM and Chiel Wyet
        Was baith born in one bower;
        Laid baith their hearts on one lady,
        The less was their honour.
    66A.2   Chiel Wyet and Lord Ingram
        Was baith born in one hall;
        Laid baith their hearts on one lady,
        The worse did them befall.
    66A.3   Lord Ingram wood her Lady Maisery
        From father and from mother;
        Lord Ingram wood her Lady Maisery
        From sister and from brother.
    66A.4   Lord Ingram wood her Lady Maisery
        With leave of a her kin;
        And every one gave full consent,
        But she said no to him.
    66A.5   Lord Ingram wood her Lady Maisery
        Into her fathers ha;
        Chiel Wyet wood her Lady Maisery
        Amang the sheets so sma.
    66A.6   Now it fell out upon a day,
        She was dressing her head,
        That ben did come her father dear,
        Wearing the gold so red.
    66A.7   He said, Get up now, Lady Maisery,
        Put on your wedding gown;
        For Lord Ingram he will be here,
        Your wedding must be done.
    66A.8   Id rather be Chiel Wyets wife,
        The white fish for to sell,
        Before I were Lord Ingrams wife,
        To wear the silk so well.
    66A.9   Id rather be Chiel Wyets wife,
        With him to beg my bread,
        Before I were Lord Ingrams wife,
        To wear the gold so red.
    66A.10  Where will I get a bonny boy,
        Will win gold to his fee,
        And will run unto Chiel Wyets,
        With this letter from me?
    66A.11  O here I am, the boy, says one,
        Will win gold to my fee,
        And carry away any letter
        To Chiel Wyet from thee.
    66A.12  And when he found the bridges broke,
        He bent his bow and swam;
        And when he found the grass growing,
        He hastened and he ran.
    66A.13  And when he came to Chiel Wyets castle,
        He did not knock nor call,
        But set his bent bow to his breast,
        And lightly leaped the wall;
        And ere the porter opend the gate,
        The boy was in the hall.
    66A.14  The first line he looked on,
        A grieved man was he;
        The next line he looked on,
        A tear blinded his ee:
        Says, I wonder what ails my one brother
        Hell not let my love be!
    66A.15  But Ill send to my brothers bridal-+-
        The bacon shall be mine-+-
        Full four and twenty buck and roe,
        And ten tun of the wine;
        And bid my love be blythe and glad,
        And I will follow syne.
    66A.16  There was not a groom about that castle
        But got a gown of green,
        And all was blythe, and all was glad,
        But Lady Maisery she was neen.
    66A.17  There was no cook about that kitchen
        But got a gown of gray,
        And all was blythe, and all was glad,
        But Lady Maisery was wae.
    66A.18  Between Mary Kirk and that castle
        Was all spread ower with garl,
        To keep Lady Maisery and her maidens
        From tramping on the marl.
    66A.19  From Mary Kirk and that castle
        Was spread a cloth of gold,
        To keep Lady Maisery and her maidens
        From treading on the mold.
    66A.20  When mass was sung, and bells was rung,
        And all men bound for bed,
        Then Lord Ingram and Lady Maisery
        In one bed they were laid.
    66A.21  When they were laid into their bed-+-
        It was baith soft and warm-+-
        He laid his hand over her side,
        Says, I think you are with bairn.
    66A.22  I told you once, so did I twice,
        When ye came me to woo,
        That Chiel Wyet, your one brother,
        One night lay in my bower.
    66A.23  I told you twice, I told you thrice,
        Ere ye came me to wed,
        That Chiel Wyet, your one brother,
        One night lay in my bed.
    66A.24  O will you father your bairn on me,
        And on no other man?
        And Ill give him to his dowry
        Full fifty ploughs of land.
    66A.25  I will not father my bairn on you,
        Nor on no wrongeous man,
        Though ye would give him to his dowry
        Five thousand ploughs of land.
    66A.26  Then up did start him Chiel Wyet,
        Shed by his yellow hair,
        And gave Lord Ingram to the heart
        A deep wound and a sair.
    66A.27  Then up did start him Lord Ingram,
        Shed by his yellow hair,
        And gave Chiel Wyet to the heart
        A deep wound and a sair.
    66A.28  There was no pity for that two lords,
        Where they were lying slain;
        But all was for her Lady Maisery,
        In that bower she gaed brain.
    66A.29  There was no pity for that two lords,
        When they were lying dead;
        But all was for her Lady Maisery,
        In that bower she went mad.
    66A.30  Said, Get to me a cloak of cloth,
        A staff of good hard tree;
        If I have been an evil woman,
        I shall beg till I dee.
    66A.31  For a bit Ill beg for Chiel Wyet,
        For Lord Ingram Ill beg three;
        All for the good and honorable marriage
        At Mary Kirk he gave me.

        The brands garnishd wi steel;
        She wishd the same might pierce his heart,
        Gin Childe Vyet were weell.
    66E.10  Child vyet bought to Lady Maisry
        The fancy ribbons sma;
        She had mair delight in her sma fancy
        Than o Lord Ingram, gowd and a.
    66E.11  Lord Ingrams gane to her father,
        And thus he did complain:
        O am I doomd to die for love,
        And nae be loved again?
    66E.12  I hae sent to you daughter
        The steed paced fu well;
        She wishes I were ower the sea,
        Gin Childe Vyet were well.
    66E.13  I hae bought to your daughter
        The siller knapped gloves;
        She wishd my hands might swell in them,
        Had she her ain true love.
    66E.14  I hae bought to your daughter
        The brands garnishd wi steel;
        She wishd the same might pierce my heart,
        Gin Childe Vyet were weell.
    66E.15  Childe Vyet bought to your daughter
        The fancy ribbons sma;
        Shes mair delight in her sma fancy
        Nor o me, gowd and a.
    66E.16  Her father turnd him round about,
        A solemn oath sware he,
        Saying, She shall be the bride this night,
        And you bridegroom shall be.
    66E.17  O had your tongue, my father dear,
        Let a your passion be;
        The reason that I love this man,
        It is unknown to thee.
    66E.18  Sweetly played the merry organs,
        Intill her mothers bower;
        But still and dum stood Lady Maisry,
        And let the tears down pour.
    66E.19  Sweetly played the harp sae fine,
        Intill her fathers ha;
        But still and dum stood Lady Maisry,
        And let tears down fa.
    66E.20  Tween Marykirk and her mothers bower,
        Was a clad ower wi gowd,
        For keeping o her snaw-white feet
        Frae treading o the mould.
    66E.21  Lord Ingram gaed in at ae church-door,
        Childe Vyet at another,
        And lightly leugh him Childe Vyet
        At Lord Ingram, his brother.
    66E.22  O laugh ye at my men, brother?
        Or do ye laugh at me?
        Or laugh ye at young Lady Maisry,
        This night my brides to be?
    66E.23  I laugh na at your men, brother,
        Nor do I laugh at thee;
        But I laugh at the knightless sport
        That I saw wi my ee.
    66E.24  It is a ring on ae finger,
        A broach on ae breast-bane;
        And if ye kent whats under that,
        Your love woud soon be dane.
    66E.25  Lord Ingram and his merry young men
        Out ower the plains are gane,
        And pensively walkd him Childe Vyet,
        Him single self alane.
    66E.26  When they had eaten and well drunken,
        And a men bound for bed,
        Lord Ingram and Lady Maisry
        In ae chamber were laid.
    66E.27  He laid his hand upon her breast,
        And thus pronounced he:
        There is a bairn within your sides,
        Wha may the father be?
    66E.28  Wha ever be your bairns father,
        Ye will father it on me;
        The fairest castle o Snowdown
        Your morning gift shall be.
    66E.29  Wha ever be my bairns father,
        Ill neer father it on thee;
        For better love I my bairns father
        Nor ever Ill love thee.
    66E.30  Then hes taen out a trusty brand,
        Laid it between them tway;
        Says, Lye ye there, ye ill woman,
        A maid for me till day.
    66E.31  Next morning her father came,
        Well belted wi a brand;
        Then up it starts him Lord Ingram,
        He was an angry man.
    66E.32  If your daughter had been a gude woman,
        As I thought she had been,
        Cauld iron shoud hae never lien
        The lang night us between.
    66E.33  Ohon, alas! my daughter dear,
        Whats this I hear o thee?
        I thought ye was a gude woman
        As in the north countrie.
    66E.34  O had your tongue, my father dear,
        Let a your sorrows be;
        I never liked Lord Ingram,
        Ye ken ye forced me.
    66E.35  Then in it came him Childe Vyet,
        Well belted wi a brand;
        Then up it raise him Lord Ingram,
        He was an angry man.
    66E.36  Win up, win up, now Lord Ingram,
        Rise up immediately,
        That you and I the quarrel try,
        Who gains the victory.
    66E.37  I hae twa brands in ae scabbard,
        That cost me mony pound;
        Take ye the best, gie me the warst,
        And Ill fight where I stand.
    66E.38  Then up it starts him Childe Vyet,
        Shook back his yellow hair;
        The first an stroke Childe Vyet drew,
        He wounded Ingram sair.
    66E.39  Then up it starts him Lord Ingram,
        Shed back his coal-black hair
        The first an stroke Lord Ingram drew,
        Childe Vyet needed nae mair.
    66E.40  Nae meen was made for these twa knights,
        Whan they were lying dead,
        But a for her Lady Maisry,
        That gaes in mournfu weed.
    66E.41  Says, If I hae been an ill woman,
        Alas and wae is me!
        And if Ive been an ill woman,
        A gude woman Ill be!
    66E.42  Yell take frae me my silk attire,
        Bring me a palmers weed,
        And thro the world, for their sakes,
        Ill gang and beg my bread.
    66E.43  If I gang a step for Childe Vyet,
        For Lord Ingram Ill gang three;
        All for the honour that he paid
        At Marykirk to me.
    66E.44  Ill gang a step for Childe Vyet,
        For Lord Ingram Ill gang three;
        It was into my mothers bower
        Childe Vyet wronged me.
