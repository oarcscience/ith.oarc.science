# 183A: Willie Macintosh


    183A.1   TURN, Willie Macintosh,
         Turn, I bid you;
         Gin ye burn Auchindown,
         Huntly will head you.
    183A.2   Head me or hang me,
         That canna fley me;
         Ill burn Auchendown
         Ere the life lea me.
    183A.3   Coming down Deeside,
         In a clear morning,
         Auchindown was in flame,
         Ere the cock-crawing.
    183A.4   But coming oer Cairn Croom,
         And looking down, man,
         I saw Willie Macintosh
         Burn Auchindown, man,
    183A.5   Bonny Willie Macintosh,
         Whare left ye your men?
         I left them in the Stapler,
         But theyll never come hame.
    183A.6   Bonny Willie Macintosh,
         Whare now is your men?
         I left them in the Stapler,
         Sleeping in their sheen.

### 183B: Willie Macintosh


    183B.1   AS I came in by Fiddich-side,
         In a May morning,
         I met Willie Mackintosh,
         An hour before the dawning.
    183B.2   Turn again, turn again,
         Turn again, I bid ye;
         If ye burn Auchindown,
         Huntly he will head ye.
    183B.3   Head me, hang me,
         That sall never fear me;
         Ill burn Auchindown
         Before the life leaves me.
    183B.4   As I came in by Auchindown,
         In a may morning,
         Auchindown was in a bleeze,
         An hour before the dawning.
         * * * * *
    183B.5   Crawing, crawing,
         For my crowse crawing,
         I lost the best feather i my wing
         For my crowse crawing.
