# 39A: Tam Lin


    39A.1   O I FORBID you, maidens a,
        That wear gowd on your hair,
        To come or gae by Carterhaugh,
        For young Tam Lin is there.
    39A.2   Theres nane that gaes by Carterhaugh
        But they leave him a wad,
        Either their rings, or green mantles,
        Or else their maidenhead.
    39A.3   Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little aboon her knee,
        And she has broded her yellow hair
        A little aboon her bree,
        And shes awa to Carterhaugh,
        As fast as she can hie.
    39A.4   When she came to Carterhaugh
        Tam Lin was at the well,
        And there she fand his steed standing,
        But away was himsel.
    39A.5   She had na pud a double rose,
        A rose but only twa,
        Till up then started young Tam Lin,
        Says, Lady, thous pu nae mae.
    39A.6   Why pus thou the rose, Janet,
        And why breaks thou the wand?
        Or why comes thou to Carterhaugh
        Withoutten my command?
    39A.7   Carterhaugh, it is my ain,
        My daddie gave it me;
        Ill come and gang by Carterhaugh,
        And ask nae leave at thee.
        * * * * *
    39A.8   Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little aboon her knee,
        And she has snooded her yellow hair
        A little aboon her bree,
        And she is to her fathers ha,
        As fast as she can hie.
    39A.9   Four and twenty ladies fair
        Were playing at the ba,
        And out then cam the fair Janet,
        Ance the flower amang them a.
    39A.10  Four and twenty ladies fair
        Were playing at the chess,
        And out then cam the fair Janet,
        As green as onie glass.
    39A.11  Out then spak an auld grey knight,
        Lay oer the castle wa,
        And says, Alas, fair Janet, for thee
        But well be blamed a.
    39A.12  Haud your tongue, ye auld facd knight,
        Some ill death may ye die!
        Father my bairn on whom I will,
        Ill father nane on thee.
    39A.13  Out then spak her father dear,
        And he spak meek and mild;
        And ever alas, sweet Janet, he says,
        I think thou gaes wi child.
    39A.14  If that I gae wi child, father,
        Mysel maun bear the blame;
        Theres neer a laird about your ha
        Shall get the bairns name.
    39A.15  If my love were an earthly knight,
        As hes an elfin grey,
        I wad na gie my ain true-love
        For nae lord that ye hae.
    39A.16  The steed that my true-love rides on
        Is lighter than the wind;
        Wi siller he is shod before,
        Wi burning gowd behind.
    39A.17  Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little aboon her knee,
        And she has snooded her yellow hair
        A little aboon her bree,
        And shes awa to Carterhaugh,
        As fast as she can hie.
    39A.18  When she cam to Carterhaugh,
        Tam Lin was at the well,
        And there she fand his steed standing,
        But away was himsel.
    39A.19  She has na pud a double rose,
        A rose but only twa,
        Till up then started young Tam Lin,
        Says Lady, thou pus nae mae.
    39A.20  Why pus thou the rose, Janet,
        Amang the groves sae green,
        And a to kill the bonie babe
        That we gat us between?
    39A.21  O tell me, tell me, Tam Lin, she says,
        Fors sake that died on tree,
        If eer ye was in holy chapel,
        Or chirstendom did see?
    39A.22  Roxbrugh he was my grandfather,
        Took me with him to bide,
        And ance it fell upon a day
        That wae did me betide.
    39A.23  And ance it fell upon a day,
        A cauld day and a snell,
        When we were frae the hunting come,
        That frae my horse I fell;
        The Queen o Fairies she caught me,
        In yon green hill to dwell.
    39A.24  And pleasant is the fairy land,
        But, an eerie tale to tell,
        Ay at the end of seven years
        We pay a tiend to hell;
        I am sae fair and fu o flesh,
        Im feard it be mysel.
    39A.25  But the night is Halloween, lady,
        The morn is Hallowday;
        Then win me, win me, an ye will,
        For weel I wat ye may.
    39A.26  Just at the mirk and midnight hour
        The fairy folk will ride,
        And they that wad their true-love win,
        At Miles Cross they maun bide.
    39A.27  But how shall I thee ken, Tam Lin,
        Or how my true-love know,
        Amang sae mony unco knights
        The like I never saw?
    39A.28  O first let pass the black, lady,
        And syne let pass the brown,
        But quickly run to the milk-white steed,
        Pu ye his rider down.
    39A.29  For Ill ride on the milk-white steed,
        And ay nearest the town;
        Because I was an earthly knight
        They gie me that renown.
    39A.30  My right hand will be glovd, lady,
        My left hand will be bare,
        Cockt up shall my bonnet be,
        And kaimd down shall my hair,
        And thaes the takens I gie thee,
        Nae doubt I will be there.
    39A.31  Theyll turn me in your arms, lady,
        Into an esk and adder;
        But hold me fast, and fear me not,
        I am your bairns father.
    39A.32  Theyll turn me to a bear sae grim,
        And then a lion bold;
        But hold me fast, and fear me not,
        As ye shall love your child.
    39A.33  Again theyll turn me in your arms
        To a red het gaud of airn;
        But hold me fast, and fear me not,
        Ill do to you nae harm.
    39A.34  And last theyll turn me in your arms
        Into the burning gleed;
        Then throw me into well water,
        O throw me in wi speed.
    39A.35  And then Ill be your ain true-love,
        Ill turn a naked knight;
        Then cover me wi your green mantle,
        And cover me out o sight.
    39A.36  Gloomy, gloomy was the night,
        And eerie was the way,
        As fair Jenny in her green mantle
        To Miles Cross she did gae.
    39A.37  About the middle o the night
        She heard the bridles ring;
        This lady was as glad at that
        As any earthly thing.
    39A.38  First she let the black pass by,
        And syne she let the brown;
        But quickly she ran to the milk-white steed,
        And pud the rider down.
    39A.39  Sae weel she minded whae he did say,
        And young Tam Lin did win;
        Syne coverd him wi her green mantle,
        As blythes a bird in spring.
    39A.40  Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,
        Out of a bush o broom:
        Them that has gotten young Tam Lin
        Has gotten a stately groom.
    39A.41  Out then spak the Queen o Fairies,
        And an angry woman was she:
        Shame betide her ill-fard face,
        And an ill death may she die,
        For shes taen awa the boniest knight
        In a my companie.
    39A.42  But had I kend, Tam Lin, she says,
        What now this night I see,
        I wad hae taen out thy twa grey een,
        And put in twa een o tree.

### 39B: Tam Lin


    39B.1   I FORBID ye, maidens a,
        That wear goud on your gear,
        To come and gae by Carterhaugh,
        For young Tom Line is there.
    39B.2   Theres nane that gaes by Carterhaugh
        But they leave him a wad.
        Either their things or green mantles,
        Or else their maidenhead.
    39B.3   But Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little above her knee,
        And she has broded her yellow hair
        A little above her bree,
        And she has gaen for Carterhaugh,
        As fast as she can hie.
    39B.4   When she came to Carterhaugh
        Tom Line was at the well,
        And there she fand his steed standing,
        But away was himsell.
    39B.5   She hadna pud a double rose,
        A rose but only twae,
        Till up then started young Tom Line,
        Says, Lady, thous pu nae mae.
    39B.6   Why pus thou the rose, Janet?
        Why breaks thou the wand?
        Why comest thou to Carterhaugh
        Withouthen my command?
    39B.7   Fair Carterhaugh it is my ain,
        My daddy gave it me;
        Ill come and gae by Carterhaugh,
        And ask nae leave at thee.
        * * * * *
    39B.8   Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little aboon her knee,
        And she has snooded her yellow hair
        A little aboon her bree,
        And she is on to her fathers ha,
        As fast as she can hie.
    39B.9   Four and twenty ladies fair
        Were playing at the ba,
        And out then came fair Janet,
        The flowr amang them a.
    39B.10  Four and twenty ladies fair
        Were playing at the chess,
        Out then came fair Janet,
        As green as ony glass.
    39B.11  Out spak an auld grey-headed knight,
        Lay owre the castle wa,
        And says, Alas, fair Janet,
        For thee well be blamd a.
    39B.12  Had your tongue, you auld grey knight,
        Some ill dead may ye die!
        Father my bairn on whom I will,
        Ill father nane on thee.
    39B.13  Out then spak her father dear,
        He spak baith thick and milde;
        And ever alas, sweet Janet, he says,
        I think ye gae wi childe.
    39B.14  If that I gae wi child, father,
        Mysell bears a the blame;
        Theres not a laird about your ha
        Shall get the bairnies name.
    39B.15  If my lord were an earthly knight,
        As hes an elfish grey,
        I wad na gie my ain true-love
        For nae lord that ye hae.
    39B.16  Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little aboon her knee,
        And she has snooded her yellow hair
        A little aboon her bree,
        And shes away to Carterhaugh,
        As fast as she can hie.
    39B.17  When she came to Carterhaugh,
        Tom Line was at the well,
        And there she faund his steed standing,
        But away was himsell.

        Says, Lady, thous pu na mae.
    39B.19  Why pus thou the rose, Janet,
        Out owr yon groves sae green,
        And a to kill your bonny babe,
        That we gat us between?
    39B.20  O tell me, tell me, Tom, she says,
        Fors sake who died on tree,
        If eer ye were in holy chapel,
        Or christendom did see.
    39B.21  Roxburgh he was my grandfather,
        Took me with him to bide,
        And ance it fell upon a day
        That wae did me betide.
    39B.22  Ance it fell upon a day,
        A cauld day and a snell,
        When we were frae the hunting come,

    39B.23  The Queen of Fairies she came by,
        Took me wi her to dwell,
        Evn where she has a pleasant land
        For those that in it dwell,

        They pay their teind to hell.
    39B.24  The night it is gude Halloween,
        The fairie folk do ride,
        And they that wad their true-love win,
        At Miles Cross they maun bide.

        Or how shall I thee knaw,
        Amang a pack o uncouth knights
        The like I never saw?
    39B.26  The first company that passes by,
        Say na, and let them gae;
        The next company that passes by,
        Say na, and do right sae;
        The third company that passes by,
        Then Ill be ane o thae.
    39B.27  Some ride upon a black, lady,
        And some ride on a brown,
        But I ride on a milk-white steed,
        And ay nearest the town:
        Because I was an earthly knight
        They gae me that renown.
    39B.28  My right hand will be glovd, lady,
        My left hand will be bare,
        And thaes the tokens I gie thee,
        Nae doubt I will be there.

        And pu me quickly down,
        Cast thy green kirtle owr me,
        And keep me frae the rain.
    39B.30  Theyll turn me in thy arms, lady,
        An adder and a snake;
        But hold me fast, let me na gae,
        To be your warldly mate.

### 39D: Tam Lin


    39D.1   O ALL you ladies young and gay,
        Who are so sweet and fair,
        Do not go into Chasters wood,
        For Tomlin will be there.
    39D.2   Fair Margret sat in her bonny bower,
        Sewing her silken seam,
        And wished to be in Chasters wood,
        Among the leaves so green.
    39D.3   She let her seam fall to her foot,
        The needle to her toe,
        And she has gone to Chasters wood,
        As fast as she could go.
    39D.4   When she began to pull the flowers,
        She pulld both red and green;
        Then by did come, and by did go,
        Said, Fair maid, let aleene.
    39D.5   O why pluck you the flowers, lady,
        Or why climb you the tree?
        Or why come ye to Chasters wood
        Without the leave of me?
    39D.6   O I will pull the flowers, she said,
        Or I will break the tree,
        For Chasters wood it is my own,
        Ill no ask leave at thee.
    39D.7   He took her by the milk-white hand,
        And by the grass green sleeve,
        And laid her low down on the flowers,
        At her he asked no leave.
    39D.8   The lady blushed, and sourly frowned,
        And she did think great shame;
        Says, if you are a gentleman,
        You will tell me your name.
    39D.9   First they did call me Jack, he said,
        And then they called me John,
        But since I lived in the fairy court
        Tomlin has always been my name.
    39D.10  So do not pluck that flower, lady,
        That has these pimples gray;
        They would destroy the bonny babe
        That weve got in our play.
    39D.11  O tell me, Tomlin, she said,
        And tell it to me soon,
        Was you ever at good church-door,
        Or got you christendoom?
    39D.12  O I have been at good church-door,
        And aff her yetts within;
        I was the Laird of Fouliss son,
        The heir of all this land.
    39D.13  But it fell once upon a day,
        As hunting I did ride,
        As I rode east and west yon hill
        There woe did me betide.
    39D.14  O drowsy, drowsy as I was!
        Dead sleep upon me fell;
        The Queen of Fairies she was there,
        And took me to hersell.
    39D.15  The Elfins is a pretty place,
        In which I love to dwell,
        But yet at every seven years end
        The last here goes to hell;
        And as I am ane o flesh and blood,
        I fear the next be mysell.
    39D.16  The morn at even is Halloween;
        Our fairy court will ride,
        Throw England and Scotland both,
        Throw al the world wide;
        And if ye would me borrow,
        At Rides Cross ye may bide.
    39D.17  You may go into the Miles Moss,
        Between twelve hours and one;
        Take holy water in your hand,
        And cast a compass round.

        Youll let them all pass by;

        Salute them reverently.
    39D.19  The next court that comes along
        Is clad in robes of green,
        And its the head court of them all,
        For in it rides the queen.
    39D.20  And I upon a milk-white steed,
        With a gold star in my crown;
        Because I am an earthly man
        Im next to the queen in renown.
    39D.21  Then seize upon me with a spring,
        Then to the ground Ill fa,
        And then youll hear a rueful cry
        That Tomlin is awa.
    39D.22  Then Ill grow in your arms two
        Like to a savage wild;
        But hold me fast, let me not go,
        Im father of your child.
    39D.23  Ill grow into your arms two
        Like an adder or a snake;
        But hold me fast, let me not go,
        Ill be your earthly maick.

        Like iron in strong fire;
        But hold me fast, let me not go,
        Then youll have your desire.
    39D.25  She rid down to Miles Cross,
        Between twelve hours and one,
        Took holy water in her hand,
        And cast a compass round.
    39D.26  The first court that came along,
        She let them all pass by;
        The next court that came along
        Saluted reverently.
    39D.27  The next court that came along
        Were clad in robes of green,
        When Tomlin, on a milk-white steed,
        She saw ride with the queen.
    39D.28  She seized him in her arms two,
        He to the ground did fa,
        And then she heard a ruefull cry
        Tomlin is now awa.
    39D.29  He grew into her arms two
        Like to a savage wild;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        The father of her child.
    39D.30  He grew into her arms two
        Like an adder or a snake;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        He was her earthly maick.
    39D.31  He grew into her arms two
        Like iron in hot fire;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        He was her hearts desire.
    39D.32  Then sounded out throw elphin court,
        With a loud shout and a cry,
        That the pretty maid of Chasters wood
        That day had caught her prey.
    39D.33  O stay, Tomlin, cried Elphin Queen,
        Till I pay you your fee;
        His father has lands and rents enough,
        He wants no fee from thee.
    39D.34  O had I known at early morn
        Tomlin would from me gone,
        I would have taken out his heart of flesh
        Put in a heart of stone.

    39G.2   Even about that knights middle
        O siller bells are nine;
        Nae ane comes to Charter wood,

        But naething heard she, nor naething saw,
        As a the woods grew dim.
    39G.10  Seven days she tarried there,
        Saw neither sun nor meen;
        At length, by a sma glimmering light,
        Came thro the wood her lane.

        For a thats in my sight.
    39G.15  Then out it speaks her brither dear,
        He meant to do her harm:
        There is an herb in Charter wood
        Will twine you an the bairn.
    39G.16  Shes taen her mantle her about,

        For to destroy the bonny bairn
        That we got in our play?
    39G.20  For if it be a knave-bairn,
        Hes heir o a my land;
        But if it be a lass-bairn,
        In red gowd she shall gang.

        As hes an elfin rae,
        I coud gang bound, love, for your sake,
        A twalmonth and a day.
    39G.22  Indeed your loves an earthly man,
        The same as well as thee,
        And lang Ive haunted Charter woods,
        A for your fair bodie.
    39G.23  O tell me, tell me, Tam-a-Line,
        O tell, an tell me true,
        Tell me this night, an mak nae lie,

        Like to the deer sae wild;
        Yell had me fast, lat me not go,
        And Ill father your child.
    39G.42  And Ill appear in your arms
        Like to a silken string;
        Yell had me fast, lat me not go,
        Till ye see the fair morning.

        Like to a naked man;

        And wi you Ill gae hame.
    39G.44  Then she has done her to Miles-corse,
        Between twall hours an ane,
        And filled her hands o holy water,
        And kiest her compass roun.
    39G.45  The first an court that came her till

        The niest an court that came her till
        Was knights, and he was there.
    39G.47  True Tam-a-Line, on milk-white steed,
        A gowd star on his crown;
        Because he was an earthly man,
        Got that for a renown.
    39G.48  And out at the steeds right nostril,
        He breathd a fiery flame;
        She loots her low, an sains hersell,
        And she was busy then.
    39G.49  Shes taen the horse then by the head,
        And loot the bridle fa;
        The Queen o Elfin she cried out,
        True Tam-a-Lines awa.
    39G.50  Stay still, true Tam-a-Line, she says,
        Till I pay you your fee:
        His father wants not lands nor rents,
        Hell ask nae fee frae thee.
    39G.51  Gin I had kent yestreen, yestreen,

        Gien you a heart o clay.
    39G.52  Then he appeared in her arms
        Like the wolf that neer woud tame;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        Case they neer meet again.
    39G.53  Then he appeared in her arms
        Like the fire burning bauld;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        He was as iron cauld.
    39G.54  And he appeared in her arms
        Like the adder an the snake;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        He was her warlds make.
    39G.55  And he appeared in her arms
        Like to the deer sae wild;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        Hes father o her child.
    39G.56  And he appeared in her arms
        Like to a silken string;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        Till she saw fair morning.
    39G.57  And he appeared in her arms
        Like to a naked man;
        She held him fast, let him not go,
        And wi her hes gane hame.
    39G.58  These news hae reachd thro a Scotland,
        And far ayont the Tay,
        That Lady Margaret, our kings daughter,
        That night had gaind her prey.
    39G.59  She borrowed her love at mirk midnight,
        Bare her young son ere day,
        And though yed search the warld wide,
        Yell nae find sic a may.

        That wear gowd on your hair,
        To come or gae by Carterhaugh,
        For young Tamlane is there.
    39I.2   Theres nane that gaes by Carterhaugh
        But maun leave him a wad,
        Either gowd rings, or green mantles,
        Or else their maidenheid.
    39I.3   Now gowd rings ye may buy, maidens,
        Green mantles ye may spin,
        But, gin ye lose your maidenheid,
        Yell neer get that agen.
    39I.4   But up then spak her, fair Janet,
        The fairest o a her kin:
        Ill cum and gang to Carterhaugh,
        And ask nae leave o him.
    39I.5   Janet has kilted her green kirtle
        A little abune her knee,
        And she has braided her yellow hair
        A little abune her bree.
    39I.6   And when she came to Carterhaugh,
        She gaed beside the well,
        And there she fand his steed standing,
        But away was himsell.
    39I.7   She hadna pud a red red rose,
        A rose but barely three,
        Till up and starts a wee wee man,
        At lady Janets knee.
    39I.8   Says, Why pu ye the rose, Janet?
        What gars ye break the tree?
        Or why come ye to Carterhaugh,
        Withouten leave o me?
    39I.9   Says, Carterhaugh it is mine ain,
        My daddie gave it me;
        Ill come and gang to Carterhaugh,
        And ask nae leave o thee.
    39I.10  Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
        Among the leaves sae green,
        And what they did I cannot tell,
        The green leaves were between.
    39I.11  Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
        Among the roses red,
        And what they did I cannot say,
        She neer returnd a maid.
    39I.12  When she cam to her fathers ha,
        She looked pale and wan;
        They thought shed dreed some sair sickness,
        Or been with some leman.
    39I.13  She didna comb her yellow hair
        Nor make meikle o her head,
        And ilka thing that lady took
        Was like to be her deid.
    39I.14  Its four and twenty ladies fair
        Were playing at the ba;
        Janet, the wightest of them anes,
        Was faintest o them a.
    39I.15  Four and twenty ladies fair
        Were playing at the chess;
        And out there came the fair Janet,
        As green as any grass.
    39I.16  Out and spak an auld grey-headed knight,
        Lay oer the castle wa:
        And ever, alas! for thee, Janet,
        But well be blamed a!
    39I.17  Now haud your tongue, ye auld grey knight,
        And an ill deid may ye die!
        Father my bairn on whom I will,
        Ill father nane on thee.
    39I.18  Out then spak her father dear,
        And he spak meik and mild:
        And ever, alas! my sweet Janet,
        I fear ye gae with child.
    39I.19  And if I be with child, father,
        Mysell maun bear the blame;
        Theres neer a knight about your ha
        Shall hae the bairnies name.
    39I.20  And if I be with child, father,
        Twill prove a wondrous birth,
        For weel I swear Im not wi bairn
        To any man on earth.
    39I.21  If my love were an earthly knight,
        As hes an elfin grey,
        I wadna gie my ain true love
        For nae lord that ye hae.
    39I.22  She prinkd hersell and prinnd hersell,
        By the ae light of the moon,
        And shes away to Carterhaugh,
        To speak wi young Tamlane.
    39I.23  And when she cam to Carterhaugh,
        She gaed beside the well,
        And there she saw the steed standing,
        But away was himsell.
    39I.24  She hadna pud double rose,
        A rose but only twae,
        When up and started young Tamlane,
        Says, Lady, thou pus nae mae.
    39I.25  Why pu ye the rose, Janet,
        Within this garden grene,
        And a to kill the bonny babe
        That we got us between?
    39I.26  The truth yell tell to me, Tamlane,
        A word ye mauna lie;
        Gin eer ye was in haly chapel,
        Or sained in Christentie?
    39I.27  The truth Ill tell to thee, Janet,
        A word I winna lie;
        A knight me got, and a lady me bore,
        As well as they did thee.
    39I.28  Randolph, Earl Murray, was my sire,
        Dunbar, Earl March, is thine;
        We loved when we were children small,
        Which yet you well may mind.
    39I.29  When I was a boy just turnd of nine,
        My uncle sent for me,
        To hunt and hauk, and ride with him,
        And keep him companie.
    39I.30  There came a wind out of the north,
        A sharp wind and a snell,
        And a deep sleep came over me,
        And frae my horse I fell.
    39I.31  The Queen of Fairies keppit me
        In yon green hill to dwell,
        And Im a fairy, lyth and limb,
        Fair ladye, view me well.
    39I.32  Then would I never tire, Janet,
        In Elfish land to dwell,
        But aye, at every seven years,
        They pay the teind to hell;
        And I am sae fat and fair of flesh,
        I fear twill be mysell.
    39I.33  This night is Halloween, Janet,
        The morn is Hallowday,
        And gin ye dare your true love win,
        Ye hae nae time to stay.
    39I.34  The night it is good Halloween,
        When fairy folk will ride,
        And they that wad their true-love win,
        At Miles Cross they maun bide.
    39I.35  But how shall I thee ken, Tamlane?
        Or how shall I thee knaw,
        Amang so many unearthly knights,
        The like I never saw?
    39I.36  The first company that passes by,
        Say na, and let them gae;
        The next company that passes by,
        Say na, and do right sae;
        The third company that passes by,
        Then Ill be ane o thae.
    39I.37  First let pass the black, Janet,
        And syne let pass the brown,
        But grip ye to the milk-white steed,
        And pu the rider down.
    39I.38  For I ride on the milk-white steed,
        And aye nearest the town;
        Because I was a christend knight,
        They gave me that renown.
    39I.39  My right hand will be gloved, Janet,
        My left hand will be bare;
        And these the tokens I gie thee,
        Nae doubt I will be there.
    39I.40  Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
        An adder and a snake;
        But had me fast, let me not pass,
        Gin ye wad be my maik.
    39I.41  Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
        An adder and an ask;
        Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
        A bale that burns fast.
    39I.42  Theyll turn me in your arms, Janet,
        A red-hot gad o airn;
        But haud me fast, let me not pass,
        For Ill do you no harm.
    39I.43  First dip me in a stand o milk,
        And then in a stand o water;
        But had me fast, let me not pass,
        Ill be your bairns father.
    39I.44  And next theyll shape me in your arms
        A tod but and an eel;
        But had me fast, nor let me gang,
        As you do love me weel.
    39I.45  Theyll shape me in your arms, Janet,
        A dove but and a swan,
        And last theyll shape me in your arms
        A mother-naked man;
        Cast your green mantle over me,
        Ill be myself again.
    39I.46  Gloomy, gloomy, was the night,
        And eiry was the way,
        As fair Janet, in her green mantle,
        To Miles Cross she did gae.
    39I.47  About the dead hour o the night
        She heard the bridles ring,
        And Janet was as glad o that
        As any earthly thing.
    39I.48  And first gaed by the black black steed,
        And then gaed by the brown;
        But fast she gript the milk-white steed,
        And pud the rider down.
    39I.49  She pud him frae the milk-white steed,
        And loot the bridle fa,
        And up there raise an erlish cry,
        Hes won amang us a!
    39I.50  They shaped him in fair Janets arms
        An esk but and an adder;
        She held him fast in every shape,
        To be her bairns father.
    39I.51  They shaped him in her arms at last
        A mother-naked man,
        She wrapt him in her green mantle,
        And sae her true love wan.
    39I.52  Up then spake the Queen o Fairies,
        Out o a bush o broom:
        She that has borrowd young Tamlane
        Has gotten a stately groom.
    39I.53  Up then spake the Queen o Fairies,
        Out o a bush o rye:
        Shes taen awa the bonniest knight
        In a my cumpanie.
    39I.54  But had I kennd, Tamlane, she says,
        A lady wad borrowd thee
        I wad taen out thy twa grey een,
        Put in twa een o tree.
    39I.55  Had I but kennd, Tamlane, she says,
        Before ye came frae hame,
        I wad taen out your heart o flesh,
        Put in a heart o stane.
    39I.56  Had I but had the wit yestreen
        That I hae coft the day,
        Id paid my kane seven times to hell
        Ere youd been won away.

    39[J2].1    The maid that sits in Katherines Hall,
        Clad in her robes so black,
        She has to yon garden gone,
        For flowers to flower her hat.
    39[J2.2]    She had not pulled the red, red rose,
        A double rose but three,
        When up there starts a gentleman,
        Just at this ladys knee.
    39[J2.3]    Says, Whos this pulls the red, red rose?
        Breaks branches off the tree?
        Or whos this treads my garden-grass,
        Without the leave of me?
    39[J2.4]    Yes, I will pull the red, red rose,
        Break branches off the tree,
        This garden in Moorcartney wood,
        Without the leave o thee.
    39[J2.5:    He took her by the milk-white hand
        And gently laid her down,
        Just in below some shady trees
        Where the green leaves hung down.
    39[J2.6]    Come tell to me, kind sir, she said,
        What before you never told;
        Are you an earthly man? said she,
        A knight or a baron bold?
    39[J2.7]    Ill tell to you, fair lady, he said,
        What before I neer did tell;
        Im Earl Douglass second son,
        With the queen of the fairies I dwell.
    39[J2.8]    When riding through yon forest-wood,
        And by yon grass-green well,
        A sudden sleep me overtook,
        And off my steed I fell.
    39[J2.9]    Ther queen of the fairies, being there,
        Made me with her to dwell,
        And still once in the seven years
        We pay a teind to hell.
    39[J2.10]   And because I am an earthly man,
        Myself doth greatly fear,
        For the cleverest man in all our train
        To Pluto must go this year.
    39[J2.11]   This night is Halloween, lady,
        And the fairies they will ride;
        The maid that will her true-love win
        At Miles Cross she may bide.
    39[J2.12]   But how shall I thee ken, though, sir?
        Or how shall I thee know,
        Amang a pack o hellish wraiths,
        Before I never saw?
    39[J2.13]   Some rides upon a black horse, lady,
        And some upon a brown,
        But I myself on a milk-white steed,
        And I aye nearest the toun.
    39[J2.14]   My right hand shall be covered, lady,
        My left hand shall be bare,
        And thats a token good enough
        That you will find me there.
    39[J2.15]   Take the Bible in your right hand,
        With God for to be your guide,
        Take holy water in thy left hand,
        And throw it on every side.
    39[J2.16]   Shes taen her mantle her about,
        A cane into her hand,
        And she has unto Miles Cross gone,
        As hard as she can gang.
    39[J2.17]   First she has letten the black pass by,
        And then she has letten the brown,
        But shes taen a fast hold o the milk-white steed,
        And shes pulled Earl Thomas doun.
    39[J2.18]   The queen of the fairies being there,
        Sae loud shes letten a cry,
        The maid that sits in Katherines Hall
        This night has gotten her prey.
    39[J2.19]   But hadst thou waited, fair lady,
        Till about this time the morn,
        He would hae been as far from thee or me
        As the wind that blew when he was born.
    39[J2.20]   They turned him in this ladys arms
        Like the adder and the snake;
        She held him fast; why should she not?
        Though her poor heart was like to break.
    39[J2.21]   They turned him in this ladys arms
        Like two red gads of airn;
        She held him fast; why should she not?
        She knew they could do her no harm.
    39[J2.22]   They turned him in this ladys arms
        Like to all things that was vile;
        She held him fast; why should she not?
        The father of her child.
    39[J2.23]   They turned him in this ladys arms
        Like to a naked knight;
        Shes taen him hame to her ain bower,
        And clothed him in armour bright.

    39[K].1 Leady Margat stands in her boor-door,
        Clead in the robs of green;
        She longed to go to Charters Woods,
        To pull the flowers her lean.
    39[K.2] She had not puld a rose, a rose,
        O not a rose but one,
        Till up it starts True Thomas,
        Said, Leady, let alone.
    39[K.3] Why pull ye the rose, Marget?
        Or why break ye the tree?
        Or why come ye to Charters Woods
        Without the leave of me?
    39[K.4] I will pull the rose, she said,
        And I will break the tree,
        For Charters Woods is all my own,
        And Il ask no leave of the.
    39[K.5] Hes tean her by the milk-white hand,
        And by the grass-green sleeve,
        And laid her lo at the foot of the tree,
        At her he askt no leave.
    39[K.6] It fell once upon a day
        They wer a pleaying at the ba,
        And every one was reed and whyte,
        Leady Margets culler was all awa.
    39[K.7] Out it speaks an elder man,
        As he stood in the gate,
        Our kings daughter she gos we bern,
        And we will get the wait.
    39[K.8] If I be we bern, she said,
        My own self beer the blame!
        There is not a man in my fathers court
        Will get my berns name.

        It grows on gravel greay,
        It ould destroy the boney young bern
        That ye got in your pley.
    39[K.10]    Shes tean her mantle her about,
        Her green glove on her hand,
        And shes awa to Charters Woods,
        As fest as she could gang.
    39[K.11]    She had no puld a pile, a pile,
        O not a pile but one,
        Up it startid True Thomas,
        Said, Leady, lat alean.
    39[K.12]    Why pull ye the pile, Marget,
        That grows on gravel green,
        For to destroy the boney young bern
        That we got us between?
    39[K.13]    If it were to an earthly man,
        As [it is] to an elphan knight,
        I ould walk for my true-loves sake
        All the long winters night.
    39[K.14]    When I was a boy of eleven years old,

        Fell asleep at yon aple tree:

        And laid on her hands on me.

        And followed him away.
    39[M.2] He rowd me in his hunting-coat
        And layd me down to sleep,
        And by the queen of fairies came,
        And took me up to keep.
    39[M.3] She set me on a milk-whtie steed;
        Twas o the elfin kind;

        Upon a mountains bree.
    39[M.5] The apples hung like stars of goud
