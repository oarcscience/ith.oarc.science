# 262A: Lord Livingston


    262A.1   IT fell about the Lammas time,
         When wightsmen won their hay,
         A the squires in merry Linkum
         Went a forth till a play.
    262A.2   They playd until the evening tide,
         The sun was gaeing down;
         A lady thro plain fields was bound,
         A lily leesome thing.
    262A.3   Two squires that for this lady pledged,
         In hopes for a renown,
         The one was calld the proud Seaton,
         The other Livingston.
    262A.4   When will ye, Michaell o Livingston,
         Wad for this lady gay?
         To-morrow, to-morrow, said Livingston,
         To-morrow, if you may.
    262A.5   Then they hae wadded their wagers,
         And laid their pledges down;
         To the high castle o Edinbro
         They made them ready boun.
    262A.6   The chamber that they did gang in,
         There it was daily dight;
         The kipples were like the gude red gowd,
         As they stood up in hight,
         And the roof-tree like the siller white,
         And shind like candles bright.
    262A.7   The lady fair into that ha
         Was comly to be seen;
         Her kirtle was made o the pa,
         Her gowns seemd o the green.
    262A.8   Her gowns seemd like green, like green,
         Her kirtle o the pa;
         A siller wand intill her hand,
         She marshalld ower them a.
    262A.9   She gae every knight a lady bright,
         And every squire a may;
         Her own sell chose him Livingston,
         They were a comely tway.
    262A.10  Then Seaton started till his foot,
         The fierce flame in his ee:
         On the next day, wi sword in hand,
         On plain fields meet ye me.
    262A.11  When bells were rung, and mass was sung,
         And a man bound for bed,
         Lord Livingston and his fair dame
         In bed were sweetly laid.
    262A.12  The bed, the bed where they lay in
         Was coverd wi the pa;
         A covering o the gude red gowd
         Lay nightly ower the twa.
    262A.13  So they lay there, till on the morn
         The sun shone on their feet;
         Then up it raise him Livingston
         To draw to him a weed.
    262A.14  The first an weed that he drew on
         Was o the linen clear;
         The next an weed that he drew on,
         It was a weed o weir.
    262A.15  The niest an weed that he drew on
         Was gude iron and steel;
         Twa gloves o plate, a gowden helmet,
         Became that hind chiel weel.
    262A.16  Then out it speaks that lady gay-+--+-
         A little forbye stood she-+--+-
         Ill dress mysell in mens array,
         Gae to the fields for thee.
    262A.17  O God forbid, said Livingston,
         That eer I dree the shame;
         My lady slain in plain fields,
         And I coward knight at hame!
    262A.18  He scarcely travelled frae the town
         A mile but barely twa
         Till he met wi a witch-woman,
         I pray to send her wae!
    262A.19  This is too gude a day, my lord,
         To gang sae far frae town;
         This is too gude a day, my lord,
         On field to make you boun.
    262A.20  I dreamd a dream concerning thee,
         O read ill dreams to guid!
         Your bower was full o milk-white swans,
         Your brides bed full o bluid.
    262A.21  O bluid is gude, said Livingston,
         To bide it whoso may;
         If I be frae yon plain fields,
         Nane knew the plight I lay.
    262A.22  Then he rade on to plain fields
         As swifts his horse coud hie,
         And ther he met the proud Seaton,
         Come boldly ower the lee.
    262A.23  Come on to me now, Livingston,
         Or then take foot and flee;
         This is the day that we must try
         Who gains the victorie.
    262A.24  Then they fought with sword in hand
         Till they were bluidy men;
         But on the point o Seatons sword
         Brave Livingston was slain.
    262A.25  His lady lay ower castle-wa,
         Beholding dale and down,
         When Blenchant brave, his gallant steed,
         Came prancing to the town.
    262A.26  O where is now my ain gude lord
         He stays sae far frae me?
         O dinna ye see your ain gude lord
         Stand bleeding by your knee?
    262A.27  O live, O live, Lord Livingston,
         The space o ae half hour,
         Theres nae a leech in Edinbro town
         But Ill bring to your door.
    262A.28  Awa wi your leeches, lady, he said,
         Of them Ill be the waur;
         Theres nae a leech in Edinbro town
         That can strong death debar.
    262A.29  Yell take the lands o Livingston
         And deal them liberallie,
         To the auld that may not, the young that cannot,
         And blind that does na see,
         And help young maidens marriages,
         That has nae gear to gie.
    262A.30  My mother got it in a book,
         The first night I was born,
         I woud be wedded till a knight,
         And him slain on the morn.
    262A.31  But I will do for my loves sake
         What ladies woudna thole;
         Ere seven years shall hae an end,
         Nae shoes gang on my sole.
    262A.32  Theres never lint gang on my head,
         Nor kame gang in my hair,
         Nor ever coal nor candle-light
         Shine in my bower mair.
    262A.33  When seven years were near an end,
         The lady she thought lang,
         And wi a crack her heart did brake,
         And sae this ends my sang.
