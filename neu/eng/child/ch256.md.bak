# 256A: Alison and Willie


    256A.1   MY luve she lives in Lincolnshire,
         I wat shes neither black nor broun,
         But her hair is like the thread o gowd,
         Aye an it waur weel kaim d doun.
    256A.2   Shes pued the black mask owre her face,
         An blinkit gaily wi her ee:
    RRrro  will you to my weddin come,
         An will you bear me gude companie?
    256A.3   I winna to your weddin come,
         Nor [will] I bear you gude companie,
         Unless you be the bride yoursell,
         An me the bridegroom to be.
    256A.4   For me to be the bride mysel,
         An you the bonnie bridegroom to be-+--+-
         Cheer up you heart, Sweet Willie, she said,
         For thats the day youll never see.
    256A.5   Gin you waur on your saddle set,
         An gaily ridin on the way,
         Youll hae nae mair mind o Alison
         Than she waur dead an laid in clay.
    256A.6   When he was on his saiddle set,
         An slowly ridin on the way,
         He had mair mind o Alison
         Than he had o the licht o day.
    256A.7   He saw a hart draw near a hare,
         An aye that hare drew near a toun,
         An that same hart did get a hare,
         But the gentle knicht got neer a toun.
    256A.8   He leant him owre his saiddle-bow,
         An his heart did brak in pieces three;
         Wi sighen said him Sweet Willie,
         The pains o luve hae taen hald o me.
    256A.9   . . . .
         . . . .
         There cam a white horse an a letter,
         That stopped the weddin speidilie.
    256A.10  She leant her back on her bed-side,
         An her heart did brak in pieces three;
         She was buried an bemoaned,
         But the birds waur Willies companie.
