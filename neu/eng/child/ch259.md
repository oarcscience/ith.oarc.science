# 259A: Lord Thomas Stuart


    259A.1   THOMAS STUART was a lord,
         A lord of mickle land;
         He used to wear a coat of gold,
         But now his grave is green.
    259A.2   Now he has wooed the young countess,
         The Countess of Balquhin,
         An given her for a morning-gift
         Strathboggie and Aboyne.
    259A.3   But womens wit is aye willful,
         Alas that ever it was sae!
         She longed to see the morning-gift
         That her gude lord to her gae.
    259A.4   When steeds were saddled an weel bridled,
         An ready for to ride,
         There came a pain on that gude lord,
         His back, likewise his side.
    259A.5   He said, Ride on, my lady fair,
         May goodness be your guide!
         For Im sae sick and weary that
         No farther can I ride.
    259A.6   Now ben did come his father dear,
         Wearing a golden band;
         Says, Is there nae leech in Edinburgh
         Can cure my son from wrang?
    259A.7   O leech is come, an leech is gane,
         Yet, father, Im aye waur;
         Theres not a leech in Edinbro
         Can death from me debar.
    259A.8   But be a friend to my wife, father,
         Restore to her her own;
         Restore to her my morning-gift,
         Strathboggie and Aboyne.
    259A.9   It had been gude for my wife, father,
         To me shed born a son;
         He would have got my land an rents,
         Where they lie out an in.
    259A.10  It had been gude for my wife, father,
         To me shed born an heir;
         He would have got my lands an rents,
         Where they lie fine and fair.
    259A.11  The steeds they strave into their stables,
         The boys couldnt get them bound;
         The hounds lay howling on the leech,
         Cause their master was behind.
    259A.12  I dreamed a dream since late yestreen,
         I wish it may be good,
         That our chamber was full of swine,
         An our bed full of blood.
    259A.13  I saw a woman come from the West,
         Full sore wringing her hands,
         And aye she cried, Ohon, alas!
         My good lords broken bands.
    259A.14  As she came by my good lords bower,
         Saw mony black steeds an brown:
         Im feared it be mony unco lords
         Havin my love from town!
    259A.15  As she came by my gude lords bower,
         Saw mony black steeds an grey:
         Im feared its mony unco lords
         Havin my love to the clay!
