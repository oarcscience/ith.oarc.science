<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">273A: King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth</H1>
<PRE>

273A.1	 In summer time, when leaves grew green,
	 and birds were singing on every tree,
	 King Edward would a hunting ride,
	 some pastime for to see.
273A.2	 Our king he would a hunting ride,
	 by eight a clock of the day,
	 And well was he ware of a bold tanner,
	 came riding on the way.
273A.3	 A good russet coat the tanner had on,
	 fast buttoned under his chin,
	 And under him a good cow-hide,
	 and a mare of four shilling.
273A.4	 &#145;Now stand you here, my good lords all,
	 under this trusty tree,
	 And I will wend to yonder fellow,
	 to know from whence came he.
273A.5	 &#145;God speed, God speed,&#146; then said our king;
	 &#146;Thou art welcome, good fellow,&#146; quoth he;
	 &#145;Which is the way to Drayton Basset
	 I pray thee shew to me.&#146;
273A.6	 &#145;The ready way to Drayton Basset,
	 from this place as thou dost stand,
	 The next pair of gallows thou comst to
	 thou must turn up [on] thy right hand.&#146;
273A.7	 at is not the way,&#146; then said our king,
	 &#146;The ready way I pray thee shew me;&#146;
	 &#145;Whether thou be thief or true man,&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#145;I&#146;m weary of thy company.
273A.8	 &#145;Away, with a vengeance,&#146; qoth the tanner,
	 &#145;I hold thee out of thy wit,
	 For all this day have I ridden and gone,
	 And I am fasting yet.&#146;
273A.9	 &#145;Go with me to Drayton Basset,&#146; said our king,
	 &#146;No daintyes we will lack;
	 We&#146;l have meat and drink of the best,
	 And I will pay the shot.&#146;
273A.10	 &#145;Godamercy for nothing,&#146; said the tanner,
	 &#146;Thou shalt pay for no dinner of mine;
	 I have more groats and nobles in my purse
	 then thou hast pence in thine.&#146;
273A.11	 &#145;God save your goods,&#146; then said the king,
	 a+end send them well to thee!&#146;
	 &#145;Be thou thief or true man,&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#145;I am weary of thy company.
273A.12	 &#145;Away, with a vengeance,&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#146;of thee I stand in fear;
	 The aparrell thou wearst on thy back
	 May seem a good lord to wear.&#146;
273A.13	 &#145;I never stole them&#146; said our king,
	 &#145;I swear to thee by the rood;&#146;
	 &#145;Thou art some ruffian of the country,
	 thou rid&#146;st in the midst of thy good.&#146;
273A.14	 at news dost thou hear?&#146; then said our king,
	 &#145;I pray what news do you hear?&#146;
	 &#145;I hear no news,&#146; answered the tanner,
	 &#146;But that cow-hides be dear.&#146;
273A.15	 &#145;Cow-hides? cow-hides?&#146; then said our king,
	 &#145;I marvell what they be;&#146;
	 &#145;Why, art thou a fool?&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#146;look, I have one under me.&#146;
273A.16	 &#145;Yet one thing now I would thee pray,
	 so that thou wouldst not be strange;
	 If thy mare be better then my steed,
	 I pray thee let us change.&#146;
273A.17	 &#145;But if you needs with me will change,
	 As change full well may ye,
	 By the faith of my body,&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#145;I look to have boot of thee.&#146;
273A.18	 &#145;What boot wilt thou ask?&#146; then said our king,
	 &#146;what boot dost thou ask on this ground?&#146;
	 &#145;No pence nor half-pence,&#146; said the tanner,
	 &#146;But a noble in gold so round.&#146;
273A.19	 &#145;Here&#146;s twenty good groats,&#146; then said the king,
	 &#146;So well paid see you be;&#146;
	 &#145;I love thee better then I did before,
	 I thought thou hadst nere a peny.
273A.20	 &#145;But if so be we needs must change,
	 as change thou must abide,
	 Though thou hast gotten Brock my mare,
	 thou shalt not have my cow-hide.&#146;
273A.21	 The tanner took the good cow-hide,
	 that of the cow was hilt,
	 And threw it upon the king&#146;s saddle,
	 That was so fairly guilt.
273A.22	 &#145;Now help me, help me,&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#145;Full quickly that I were gone,
	 For when I come home to Gillian my wife
	 she&#146;l say I&#146;m a gentleman.&#146;
273A.23	 The king took the tanner by the leg,
	 he girded a fart so round;
	 &#145;You&#146;r very homely,&#146; said the king,
	 &#146;were I aware, I&#146;d laid you o th&#146; ground.&#146;
273A.24	 But when the tanner was in the king&#146;s saddle
	 aston d then he was;
	 He knew not the stirrops that he did wear,
	 whether they were gold or brass.
273A.25	 But when the steed saw the black cow-tale wag,
	 for and the black cow-horn,
	 The steed began to run away,
	 as the divel the tanner had born.
273A.26	 Untill he came unto a nook,
	 a little beside an ash;
	 The steed gave the tanner such a fall
	 his neck was almost brast.
273A.27	 &#145;Take thy horse again, with a vengeance,&#146; he said,
	 &#146;with me he shall not abide;&#146;
	 &#145;It is no marvell,&#146; said the king, and laught,
	 &#146;He knew not your cow-hide.
273A.28	 &#145;But if that we needs now must change,
	 as change that well we mought,
	 I&#146;le swear to you plain, if you have your mare,
	 I look to have some boot.&#146;
273A.29	 &#145;What boot will you ask?&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#145;What boot will you ask on this ground?&#146;
	 &#145;No pence nor half-pence,&#146; said our king,
	 &#146;But a noble in gold so round.&#146;
273A.30	 &#145;Here&#146;s twenty [good] groats,&#146; said the tanner,
	 a+end twenty more I have of thine;
	 I have ten groats more in my purse,
	 we&#146;l drink five of them at the wine.&#146;
273A.31	 The king set a bugle-horne to his mouth,
	 that blew both loud and shrill,
	 And five hundred lords and knights
	 came riding over a hill.
273A.32	 &#145;Away, with a vengeance,&#146; quoth the tanner,
	 &#146;with thee I&#146;le no longer abide;
	 Thou art a strong thief, yonder be thy fellows,
	 they will steal away my cow-hide.&#146;
273A.33	 &#145;No I protest,&#146; then said our king,
	 &#146;For so it may not be;
	 They be the lords of Drayton Basset,
	 come out of the North Country.&#146;
273A.34	 But when they came before the king
	 full low they fell on their knee;
	 The tanner had rather then a thousand pound
	 he had been out of his company.
273A.35	 &#145;A coller! a coller!&#146; then said the king,
	 a+e coller!&#146; then did he cry;
	 Then would he have given a thousand pound
	 he had not been so nigh.
273A.36	 &#145;A coller? a coller?&#146; then quoth the tanner,
	 &#146;it is a thing which will breed sorrow;
	 For after a coller commeth a halter,
	 and I shall be hanged tomorrow.&#146;
273A.37	 &#145;No, do not fear,&#146; the king did say;
	 &#146;For pastime thou hast shown me,
	 No coller nor halter thou shalt have,
	 but I will give thee a fee.
273A.38	 &#145;For Plompton Park I will give thee,
	 with tenements three beside,
	 Which is worth three hundred pound a year,
	 to maintain thy good cow-hide.&#146;
273A.39	 &#145;Godamercy, Godamercy,&#146; quoth the tanner;
	 &#146;For this good deed thou hast done,
	 If ever thou comest to merry Tamworth
	 thou shalt have clouting-leather for thy shone.&#146;
