# 263A: The New-Slain Knight


    263A.1   MY heart is lighter than the poll;
         My folly made me glad,
         As on my rambles I went out,
         Near by a garden-side.
    263A.2   I walked on, and father on,
         Love did my heart engage;
         There I spied a well-faird maid,
         Lay sleeping near a hedge.
    263A.3   Then I kissd her with my lips
         And stroked her with my hand:
         Win up, win up, ye well-faird maid,
         This day ye sleep oer lang.
    263A.4   This dreary sight that I hae seen
         Unto my heart gives pain;
         At the south side o your fathers garden,
         I see a knight lies slain.
    263A.5   O what like was his hawk, his hawk?
         Or what like was his hound?
         And what like was the trusty brand
         This new-slain knight had on?
    263A.6   His hawk and hound were from him gone,
         His steed tied to a tree;
         A bloody brand beneath his head,
         And on the ground lies he.
    263A.7   O what like was his hose, his hose?
         And what like was his shoon?
         And what like was the gay clothing
         This new-slain knight had on?
    263A.8   His coat was of the red scarlet,
         His waistcoat of the same;
         His hose were of the bonny black,
         And shoon laced with cordin.
    263A.9   Bonny was his yellow hair,
         For it was new combd down;
         Then, sighing sair, said the lady fair,
         I combd it late yestreen.
    263A.10  O wha will shoe my fu fair foot?
         Or wha will glove my hand?
         Or wha will father my dear bairn,
         Since my loves dead and gane?
    263A.11  O I will shoe your fu fair foot,
         And I will glove your hand;
         And Ill be father to your bairn,
         Since your loves dead and gane.
    263A.12  I winna father my bairn, she said,
         Upon an unkent man;
         Ill father it on the King of Heaven,
         Since my loves dead and gane.
    263A.13  The knight he knackd his white fingers,
         The lady tore her hair;
         Hes drawn the mask from off his face,
         Says, Lady, mourn nae mair.
    263A.14  For ye are mine, and I am thine,
         I see your love is true;
         And if I live and brook my life
         Yese never hae cause to rue.
