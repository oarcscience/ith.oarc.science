# 203A: The Baron of Brackley


    203A.1   Inverey cam doun Deeside, whistlin and playin,
         He was at brave Braikleys yett ere it was dawin.
    203A.2   He rappit fu loudly and wi a great roar,
         Cried, Cum doun, cum doun, Braikley, and open the door.
    203A.3   Are ye sleeping, Baronne, or are ye wakin?
         Thers sharpe swords at your yett, will gar your blood spin.
    203A.4   Open the yett, Braikley, and lat us within,
         Till we on the green turf gar your bluid rin.
    203A.5   Out spak the brave baronne, owre the castell-wa:
         Are ye cum to spulyie and plunder mi ha?
    203A.6   But gin ye be gentlemen, licht and cum in:
         Gin ye drink o my wine, yell nae gar my bluid spin.
    203A.7   Gin ye be hird widifus, ye may gang by,
         Ye may gang to the lawlands and steal their fat ky.
    203A.8   Ther spulyie like rievers o wyld kettrin clan,
         Who plunder unsparing baith houses and lan.
    203A.9   Gin ye be gentlemen, licht an cum [in],
         Thers meat an drink i my ha for every man.
    203A.10  Gin ye bird widifus, ye may gang by,
         Gang doun to the lawlands, and steal horse and ky.
    203A.11  Up spak his ladie, at his bak where she lay,
         Get up, get up, Braikley, and be not afraid;
         Ther but young hird widifus wi belted plaids.
    203A.12  Cum kiss me, mi Peggy, Ile nae langer stay,
         For I will go out and meet Inverey.
    203A.13  But haud your tongue, Peggy, and mak nae sic din,
         For yon same hird widifus will prove themselves men.
    203A.14  She called on her marys, they cam to her hand;
         Cries, Bring me your rocks, lassies, we will them command.
    203A.15  Get up, get up, Braikley, and turn bak your ky,
         Or me an mi women will them defy.
    203A.16  Cum forth then, mi maidens, and show them some play;
         Well ficht them, and shortly the cowards will fly.
    203A.17  Gin I had a husband, whereas I hae nane,
         He woud nae ly i his bed and see his ky taen.
    203A.18  Thers four-and-twenty milk-whit calv5s, tw1l o them ky,
         In the woods o Glentanner, its ther thei a ly.
    203A.19  Thers goat i the Etnach, and sheep o the brae,
         An a will be plunderd by young Inverey.
    203A.20  Now haud your tongue, Peggy, and gie me a gun,
         Yell see me gae furth, but Ill never cum in.
    203A.21  Call mi brother William, mi unkl also,
         Mi cousin James Gordon; well mount and well go.
    203A.22  When Braikley was ready and stood i the closs,
         He was the bravest baronne that eer mounted horse.
    203A.23  Whan all wer assembld o the castell green,
         No man like brave Braikley was ther to be seen
    203A.24  . . . . .
         Turn bak, brother William, ye are a bridegroom;
    203A.25  Wi bonnie Jean Gordon, the maid o the mill;
         O sichin and sobbin shell soon get her fill.
    203A.26  Im no coward, brother, tis kend Im a man;
         Ill ficht i your quarral as langs I can stand.
    203A.27  Ill ficht, my dear brother, wi heart and gude will,
         And so will young Harry that lives at the mill.
    203A.28  But turn, mi dear brother, and nae langer stay:
         Whatll cum o your ladie, gin Braikley thei slay?
    203A.29  Whatll cum o your ladie and bonnie young son?
         O whatll cum o them when Braikley is gone?
    203A.30  I never will turn: do you think I will fly?
         But here I will ficht, and here I will die.
    203A.31  Strik dogs, crys Inverey, a+end ficht till yere slayn,
         For we are four hundered, ye are but four men.
    203A.32  Strik, strik, ye proud boaster, your honour is gone,
         Your lands we will plunder, your castell well burn.
    203A.33  At the head o the Etnach the battel began,
         At Little Auchoilzie thei killd the first man.
    203A.34  First thei killd ane, and soon they killd twa,
         Thei killd gallant Braikley, the flour o them a.
    203A.35  Thei killd William Gordon, and James o the Knox,
         And brave Alexander, the flour o Glenmuick.
    203A.36  What sichin and moaning was heard i the glen,
         For the Baronne o Braikley, who basely was slayn!
    203A.37  Cam ye bi the castell, and was ye in there?
         Saw ye pretty Peggy tearing her hair?
    203A.38  Yes, I cam by Braikley, and I gaed in there,
         And there [saw] his ladie braiding her hair.
    203A.39  She was rantin, and dancin, and singin for joy,
         And vowin that nicht she woud feest Inverey.
    203A.40  She eat wi him, drank wi him, welcomd him in,
         Was kind to the man that had slayn her baronne.
    203A.41  Up spake the son on the nourices knee,
         Gin I live to be a man, revenged Ill be.
    203A.42  Thers dool i the kitchin, and mirth i the ha,
         The Baronne o Braikley is dead and awa.

    203B.6   Rise up, John, she said, a+end turn in yer kye,
         For theyll hae them to the Hielands, and you theyl defie.
    203B.7   Had your still, Catharine, and still yer young son,
         For yell get me out, but Ill never cum in.

    203C.1   O Inverey came down Dee side, whistling and playing;
         Hes landed at Braiklys yates at the day dawing.
    203C.2   Says, Baron of Braikly, are ye within?
         Theres sharp swords at the yate will gar your blood spin.

         Theyre oer the hills rinning, theyre skipping away.
    203C.5   Come to your bed, Peggie, and let the kye rin,
         For were I to gang out, I would never get in.
    203C.6   Then shes cryd on her women, they quickly came ben:
         Take up your rocks, lassies, and fight a like men.
    203C.7   Though Im but a woman, to head you Ill try,
         Nor let these vile Highland-men steal a our kye.
    203C.8   Then up gat the baron, and cryd for his graith;
         Says, Lady, Ill gang, tho to leave you Im laith.
    203C.9   Come, kiss me, my Peggie, nor think Im to blame;
         For I may well gang out, but Ill never win in.

         There was nane wi bonny Braikly but his brother and he.
    203C.12  Twa gallanter Gordons did never sword draw;
         But against four and thirty, waes me, what was twa?
    203C.13  Wi swords and wi daggers they did him surround,
         And theyve piercd bonny Braikly wi mony a wound.
    203C.14  Frae the head of the Dee to the banks of the Spey,
         The Gordons may mourn him, and bann Inverey.
    203C.15  O came ye by Braikly, and was ye in there?
         Or saw ye his Peggy dear riving her hair?
