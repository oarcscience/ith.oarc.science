    17A.3   Hes gien to her a silver wand,
        With seven living lavrocks sitting thereon.

        With seven bright diamonds set therein.

        You may know by it my love is gane.
    17A.6   One day as he looked his ring upon,

    17A.7   He left the sea and came to land,
        And the first that he met was an old beggar man.
