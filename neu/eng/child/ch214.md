# 214A: The Braes o Yarrow


    214A.1   I dreamed a dreary dream this night,
         That fills my heart wi sorrow;
         I dreamed I was pouing the heather green
         Upon the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.2   O true-love mine, stay still and dine,
         As ye ha done before, O;
         O Ill be hame by hours nine,
         And frae the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.3   I dreamed a dreary dream this night,
         That fills my heart wi sorrow;
         I dreamed my luve came headless hame,
         O frae the braes of Yarrow!
    214A.4   O true-luve mine, stay still and dine,
         As ye ha done before, O;
         O Ill be hame by hours nine,
         And frae the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.5   O are ye going to hawke, she says,
         As ye ha done before, O?
         Or are ye going to weild your brand,
         Upon the braes of Yarrow?
    214A.6   O I am not going to hawke, he says,
         As I have done before, O,
         But for to meet your brother Jhon,
         Upon the braes of Yarrow,
    214A.7   As he gade down yon dowy den,
         Sorrow went him before, O;
         Nine well-wight men lay waiting him,
         Upon the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.8   I have your sister to my wife,
         Ye think me an unmeet marrow;
         But yet one foot will I never flee
         Now frae the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.9   Than four he killd and five did wound,
         That was an unmeet marrow!
         And he had weel nigh wan the day
         Upon the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.10  Bot a cowardly loon came him behind,
         Our Lady lend him sorrow!
         And wi a rappier pierced his heart,
         And laid him low on Yarrow.
    214A.11  Now Douglas to his sisters gane,
         Wi meikle dule and sorrow:
         Gae to your luve, sister, he says,
         Hes sleeping sound on Yarrow.
    214A.12  As she went down yon dowy den,
         Sorrow went her before, O;
         She saw her true-love lying slain
         Upon the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.13  She swoond thrice upon his breist
         That was her dearest marrow;
         Said, Ever alace and wae the day
         Thou wentst frae me to Yarrow!
    214A.14  She kist his mouth, she kaimed his hair,
         As she had done before, O ;
         She wiped the blood that trickled doun
         Upon the braes of Yarrow.
    214A.15  Her hair it was three quarters lang,
         It hang baith side and yellow;
         She tied it round Her white hause-bane,
         And tint her life on Yarrow.

         I the bonnie braes o Yarrow,
         But I will try the weel airmt sword,

         My brethren three they will slay thee,

         An early sings the sparrow;

         God keep us a fae sorrow!
         That my good lord was sleepin soun

### 214C: The Braes o Yarrow


    214C.1   THERE were three lords birling at the wine
         On the dowie downs o Yarrow;
         They made a compact them between
         They would go fight tomorrow.
    214C.2   Thou took our sister to be thy bride,
         And thou neer thocht her thy marrow;
         Thou stealed her frae her daddies back,
         When she was the rose o Yarrow.
    214C.3   Yes, I took thy sister to be my bride,
         And I made her my marrow;
         I stealed her frae her daddies back,
         And shes still the rose o Yarrow.
    214C.4   He is hame to his lady gane,
         As he had done before! O;
         Says, Madam. I must go and fight
         On the dowie downs o Yarrow.
    214C.5   Stay at hame, my lord, she said,
         For that will cause much sorrow;
         For my brethren three they will slay thee,
         On the dowie downs o Yarrow.
    214C.6   Hold your tongue, my lady fair,
         For what needs a this sorrow?
         For Ill be hame gin the clock strikes nine,
         From the dowie downs o Yarrow.
    214C.7   She wush his face, she kamed his hair,
         As she had dune before, O;
         She dressed him up in his armour clear,
         Sent him furth to fight on Yarrow.
    214C.8   Come you here to hawk or hound,
         Or drink the wine thats so clear, O?
         Or come you here to eat in your words,
         That youre not the rose o Yarrow?
    214C.9   I came not here to hawk or hound,
         Nor to drink the wine thats so clear, O;
         Nor I came not here to eat in my words,
         For Im still the rose o Yarrow.
    214C.10  Then they a begoud to fight,
         I wad they focht richt sore, O,
         Till a cowardly man came behind his back,
         And pierced his body thorough.
    214C.11  Gae hame, gae hame, its my man John,
         As ye have done before, O,
         And tell it to my gay lady
         That I soundly sleep on Yarrow.
    214C.12  His man John he has gane hame,
         As he had dune before, O,
         And told it to his gay lady,
         That  he soundly slept on Yarrow.
    214C.13  I dreamd a dream now since the streen,
         God keep us a frae sorrow!
         That my lord and I was puing the heather green
         From the dowie downs o Yarrow.
    214C.14  Sometimes she rade, sometimes she gaed,
         As she had dune before, O,
         And aye between she fell in a soune,
         Lang or she cam to Yarrow.
    214C.15  Her hair it was five quarters lang,
         Twas like the gold for yellow;
         She twisted it round his milk-white hand,
         And shes drawn him hame from Yarrow.
    214C.16  Out and spak her father dear,
         Says, What needs a this sorrow?
         For Ill get you a far better lord
         Than ever died on Yarrow.
    214C.17  O hold your tongue, father, she said,
         For yeve bred a my sorrow;
         For that rosell neer spring sae sweet in May
         As that rose I lost on Yarrow.

### 214D: The Braes o Yarrow

         On the bonny braes of Yarrow;
         There fell a combat them between,
    Wha  was the rose of Yarrow.
    214D.2   Up then spak a noble lord,
         And I wot it was bot sorrow:
         I have as fair a flower, he said,
         As ever sprang on Yarrow.
    214D.3   Then he went hame to his ain house,
         For to sleep or the morrow,
         But the first sound the trumpet gae
         Was, Mount and haste to Yarrow.
    214D.4   Oh stay at hame, his lady said,
         Oh stay untill the morrow,
         And I will mount upon a steed,
         And ride with you to Yarrow.
    214D.5   Oh hawd your tongue, my dear, said he,
         And talk not of the morrow;
         This day I have to fight again,
         In the dowy deans of Yarrow.
    214D.6   As he went up yon high, high hill,
         Down the dowy deans of Yarrow,
         There he spyd ten weel armd men,
         There was nane o them his marrow.
    214D.7   Five he wounded and five he slew,
         In the dowy deans of Yarrow,
         But an English-man out of a bush
         Shot at him a lang sharp arrow.
    214D.8   Ye may gang hame, my brethren three,
         Ye may gang hame with sorrow,
         And say this to my fair lady,
         I am sleeping sound on Yarrow.
    214D.9   Sister, sister, I dreamt a dream-+--+-
         You read a dream to gude, O!
         That I was puing the heather green
         On the bonny braes of Yarrow.
    214D.10  Sister, sister, Ill read your dream,
         But alas! its unto sorrow;
         Your good lord is sleeping sound,
         He is lying dead on Yarrow.
    214D.11  She as pud the ribbons of her head,
         And I wot it was wi sorrow,
         And shes gane up yon high, high hill,
         Down the dowy deans of Yarrow.
    214D.12  Her hair it was five quarters lang,

         And she as carried him frae Yarrow.
    214D.13  O hawd your tongue! her father says,
         What needs a this grief and sorrow?
         Ill wed you on as fair a flower
         As ever sprang on Yarrow.
    214D.14  No, hawd your tongue, my father dear,
         Im fow of grief and sorrow;
         For a fairer flower ne[v]er sprang
         Than Ive lost this day on Yarrow.
    214D.15  This lady being big wi bairn,
         And fow of grief and sorrow,
         She as died within her fathers arms,
         And she died lang or the morrow.

         As she had done before, O;
         She drank the bleed that from him ran,
         On the dowie banks o Yarrow.
    214G.8   Take hame your oxen, tak hame your kye,
         Theyve bred to me great sorrow;
         I wish they had all now gone mad
         First when they came to Yarrow.
    214G.9   O hold your tongue now, daughter dear,
         These words to me s great sorrow;
         Ill wed you on a better lord

### 214J: The Braes o Yarrow


    214J.1   IN Thoro town there lives a maid,
         I am sure she has no marrow;
         For she has forsaken both lords and knights,
         And loved a servant-lad in Galla.
    214J.2   Evening and morning her page he ran,
         Her page he ran wi sorrow,
         With letters bound, just frae the town,
         To the servant-lad in Galla.
    214J.3   Her father he got word of that,
         And hes bred all her sorrow;
         He sent him forth to fight wi nine,
         In the dowie glens of Yarrow.
    214J.4   She washd his face, she combd his hair,
         She thought he had no marrow;
         Wi a thrusty rapier by his side,
         She sent him forth to Yarrow.
    214J.5   Shes taen fareweel of him that day,
         As she had done before, O,
         And shes comd back to her bonny bower,
         But her loves away to Yarrow.
    214J.6   He wanderd up, he wandred down,
         His heart was full of sorrow;
         There he spied nine gentlemen,
         Watering their steeds in Yarrow.
    214J.7   O come away, young man, they said,
         Im sure yer no our marrow;
         Yer welcome here, young man, they said,
         For the bonny lass o Thorro.
    214J.8   Nine against one, weel do ye ken,
         Thats no an equal marrow;
         Yet for my loves sake Ill venture my life,
         In the dowie glens of Yarrow.
    214J.9   Five was wounded, and four was slain,
         Amongst them a he had no marrow;
         Hes mounted on his horse again,
         Cries, I have won the bonny lass of Thorro!
    214J.10  Up then spake her father dear-+--+-
         And hes bred all her sorrow-+--+-
         And wi a broad sword ran him through,
         In the dowie glens of Yarrow.
    214J.11  I have dreamd a dream, father,
         I doubt I have dreamd for sorrow;
         I dreamd I was pouing the heather green
         Wi my true love in Yarrow.
    214J.12  O I will read your dream, daughter,
         Although it be for your sorrow;
         Go, and yell find your love lying sound,
         In a heather-bush in Yarrow.
    214J.13  Shes calld on her maidens then-+--+-
         Her heart was full of sorrow-+--+-
         And shes away wi her maidens twa,
         To the dowie glens o Yarrow.
    214J.14  She wandered up, she wandred down,
         In the dowie glens of Yarrow,
         And there she spied her lobe lying sound,
         In a heather-bush in Yarrow.
    214J.15  Shes washd hin in the clear well-strand,
         Shes dryd him wi the holland,
         And aye she sighd, and said, Alass!
         For my love I had him chosen.
    214J.16  His hair it was three quarters long,
         Three quarters long and yellow;
         And shes rapt it round her middle small,
         And brought it home to Thorro.
    214J.17  O hold your tongue, my daughter dear,
         And talk no more of sorrow;
         Ill soon wed you on a better match
         Than your servant-lad in Galla.
    214J.18  O you may wed a your seven sons,
         I wish you may wed them in sorrow:
         O you may wed a your seven sons,
         For youll neer wed the bonny lass of Thoro.
    214J.19  This lady being big wi child,
         And her heart was full wi sorrow,
         She died between her fathers arms,
         In the bonny house of Thorro.

### 214K: The Braes o Yarrow


    214K.1   THERE lived a lady in the south,
         She thought she had not her marrow;
         And she was courted by nine gentlemen,
         In the dowie dens in Yarrow.
    214K.2   All their offers they proved in vain,
         She thought that they were not her marrow;
         She has forsaken a the nine,
         Loved a servant-lad on Galla.
    214K.3   RR rrup bespoke her father dear,
         Who bred them a this sorrow;
         You must go far, far to fight the nine,
         In the dowie den in Yarrow,
    214K.4   She washd his face, she combd his hair,
         Her heart being full of sorrow,
         With a rusted rapier down by his side,
         To fight his foes in Yarrow.
    214K.5   Hes ridden east, hes ridden west,
         Hes ridden into Yarrow,
         And there he espied all the nine,
         Watering their steeds in Yarrow.
    214K.6   Yer welcome, welcome, young man, they said,
         But I think ye are not our marrow;
         But Ill fight ye all out, one by one,
         In the dowie dens o Yarrow.
    214K.7   Four he has wounded, five he has slain,
         He left then a sound in Yarrow;
         He turned him round with rejoyfull looks,
         Says, I wone the lady of Thoro.
    214K.8   Up then spoke her father dear,
         Who bred them a this sorrow;
         Hes taen out a broadsword and run him through,
         In the dowie dens o Yarrow.
    214K.9   I dreamed a dream last night, she says,
         I fear it is for sorrow;
         I dreand I was pulling the heather green
         With my true love in Yarrow.
    214K.10  Ill read your dream now, daughter dear,
         I fear it is for sorrow;
         You will find your true-love lying sound,
         In a heather bush in Yarrow.
    214K.11  Shes ridden east, shes ridden west,
         Shes ridden into Yarrow;
         There she found her true lover sound,
         In a heather bush in Yarrow.
    214K.12  His hair it was five quarters lang,
         It was baith lang and yellow;
         Shes tied it to her horses mane,
         Shes trailed him home from Yarrow.
    214K.13  O woe be to you, father dear!
         Youve bred me all this sorrow;
         So she died between her fathers arms,
         In the dowie dens o Yarrow.

### 214L: The Braes o Yarrow


    214L.1   AT Dryhope lived a lady fair,
         The fairest flower in Yarrow,
         And she refused nine noble men
         For a servan lad in Gala.
    214L.2   Her father said that he should fight
         The nine lords all to-morrow,
         And he that should the victor be
         Would get the Rose of Yarrow.
    214L.3   Quoth he, Youre nine, an Im but ane,
         And in that theres no much marrow;
         Yet I shall fecht ye, man for man,
         In the dowie dens o Yarrow.
    214L.4   She kissed his lips, and combed his hair,
         As oft shed done before, O,
         An set him on her milk-white steed,
         Which bore him on to Yarrow.
    214L.5   When he got oer yon high, high hill,
         An down the dens o Yarrow,
         There did he see the nine lords all,
         But there was not one his marrow.
    214L.6   Now here yere nine, an Im but ane,
         But yet I am not sorrow;
         For here Ill fecht ye, man for man,
         For my true love in Yarrow.
    214L.7   Then he wheeld round, and fought so fierce
         Till the seventh fell in Yarrow,
         When her brother sprang from a bush behind,
         And ran his body thorough.
    214L.8   He never spoke more words than these,
         An they were words o sorrow;
         Ye may tell my true love, if ye please,
         That Im sleepin sound in Yarrow.
    214L.9   Theyve taen the young man by the heels
         And trailed him like a harrow,
         And then they flung the comely youth
         In a whirlpool o Yarrow.
    214L.10  The lady said, I dreamed yestreen-+--+-
         I fear it bodes some sorrow-+--+-
         That I was puin the heather green
         On the scroggy braes o Yarrow.
    214L.11  Her brother said, Ill read your dream,
         But it should cause nae sorrow;
         Ye may go seek your lover hame,
         For hes sleepin sound in Yarrow.
    214L.12  Then she rode oer yon gloomy height,
         An her heart was fu o sorrow,
         But only saw the clud o night,
         Or heard the roar o Yarrow.
    214L.13  But she wandered east, so did she wast,
         And searched the forest thorough,
         Until she spied her ain true love,
         Lyin deeply drowned in Yarrow.
    214L.14  His hair it was five quarters lang,
         Its colour was the yellow;
         She twined it round her lily hand,
         And drew him out o Yarrow.
    214L.15  She kissed his lips, and combed his head,
         As oft shed done before, O;
         She laid hin oer her milk-white steed,
         An bore him home from Yarrow.
    214L.16  She washed his wounds in yon well-strand,
         And dried him wi the hollan,
         And aye she sighed, and said, Alas!
         For my love I had him chosen.
    214L.17  Go hold your tongue, her father said,
         Theres little cause for sorrow;
         Ill wed ye on a better lad
         Than ye hae lost in Yarrow.
    214L.18  Haud your ain tongue, my faither dear,
         I canna help my sorrow;
         A fairer flower neer sprang in May
         Than I hae lost in Yarrow.
    214L.19  I meant to make my bed fu wide,
         But you may make it narrow;
         For now Ive nane to be my guide
         But a deid man drowned in Yarrow.
    214L.20  An aye she screighed, and cried Alas!
         Till her heart did break wi sorrow,
         An sank into her faithers arms,
         Mang the dowie dens o Yarrow.

    214M.9   She kist his mouth, an shes combd his hair,
         As she had done before, O,
         She drank the blood that from him ran,
         In the dowie banks of Yarrow.
    214M.10  O hold your tongue now. daughter, he says,

    214N.1   THE cock did craw, and the day did daw,
         And the moon shone fair and clearly;
         Sir James gade out o his castle-yett,
         To meet fair Anne, his dearie.
    214N.2   O come down, come down, my true-love Anne,
         And speak but ae word to me!
         But ae kiss o your bonny mouth
         Wad yield much comfort to me.
    214N.3   O how can I come down? she says,
         Or how can I win to thee?
         When there is nane that I can trust
         Wad safe convey me to thee.
    214N.4   But gang doun, gang doun, to yon hostess house,
         And there take on yere lawing,
         And, as Im a woman kind and true,
         Ill meet you at the dawing.
    214N.5   Then he gade thro the good green-wood,
         And oer the moor sae eerie,
         And lang he stayd, and sair he sighd,
         But he never mair saw his dearie.
    214N.6   And ay he sat, and lang he drank,
         And ay he counted his lawing,
         Till fifteen men did him surround,
         To slay him or the dawing.
    214N.7   O she promisd ance to meet me this night,
         But I find she deceived me;
         She promisd ance to meet me this night,
         And shes sent fifteen to slay me!
    214N.8   There are twa swords in my scabard,
         They cost me gowd and money;
         Take ye the best, and gie me the warst,
         And man for man Ill try ye.
    214N.9   Then they fought on, and on they fought,
         Till maist o them were fallen,
         When her brother John cam him behind,
         And slew him at the dawing.
    214N.10  Then hes away to his sister Anne,
         To the chamber wheres shes lying:
         Come doun, come doun, my sister Anne,
         And take up your true-love Jamie!
    214N.11  Come doun, come doun now, sister Anne!
         For hes sleeping in yon logie;
         Sound, sound he sleeps, nae mair to wake,
         And nae mair need ye be vogie.
    214N.12  I dreamd a drearie dream yestreen,
         Gin it be true, it will prove my sorrow;
         I dreamd my luive had lost his life,
         Within the yetts o Gowrie.
    214N.13  O wae betide ye, lassies o Gowrie
         For ye hae sleepit soundly;
         Gin ye had keepit your yetts shut,
         Ye might hae savd the life o my Jamie.
    214N.14  Yestreen my luive had a suit o claise
         Were o the finest tartan;
         But lang or ere the day did daw
         They war a red bluid to the garten.
    214N.15  Yestreen my luive had a suit o claise
         Were o the apple reamin;
         But lang or ere the day did daw
         The red bluid had them streamin.
    214N.16  In yon fair ha, where the winds did blaw,
         When the moon shone fair and clearly,
         Shes thrawn her green skirt oer her head,
         And ay she cried out mercy.

### 214O: The Braes o Yarrow


    214O.1   I DREAMD a dreary dream last night,
         God keep us a frae sorrow!
         I dreamd I pud the birk sae green
         Wi my true love on Yarrow.
    214O.2   Ill read your dream, my sister dear,
         Ill tell you a your sorrow;
         You pud the birk wi your true luve,
         Hes killd, hes killd on Yarrow!
    214O.3   O gentle wind, that blaweth south
         To where my love repaireth,
         Convey a kiss from his dear mouth,
         And tell me how he fareth!
    214O.4   But oer yon glen run armed men,
         Have wrought me dule and sorrow;
         Theyve slain, theyve slain the comliest swain,
         He bleeding lies on Yarrow.

### 214P: The Braes o Yarrow


    214P.1   GET up, get up now, sister Ann,
         I fear weve wrought you sorrow;
         Get up, yell find your true love slain,
         Among the banks of Yarrow.
    214P.2   I made my love a suit of clothes,
         I clad him all in tartan,
         But ere the morning sun arose,
         He was a bluid to the gartan.

         In the dowie dens of Yarrow.
    214[Q.9]    O daughter dear, I read your dream,
