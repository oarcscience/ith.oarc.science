# 287A: Captain Ward and the Rainbow


    287A.1   STRIKE up, you lusty gallants, with musick and sound of drum,
         For we have descryed a rover, upon the sea is come;
         His name is Captain Ward, right well it doth appear,
         There has not been such a rover found out this thousand year.
    287A.2   For he hath sent unto our king, the sixth of January,
         Desiring that he might come in, with all his company:
         And if your king will let me come till I my tale have told,
         I will bestow for my ransome full thirty tun of gold.
    287A.3   O nay! O nay! then said our king, O nay! this may not be,
         To yield to such a rover my self will not agree;
         He hath deceivd the French-man, likewise the King of Spain,
         And how can he be true to me that hath been false to twain?
    287A.4   With that our king provided a ship of worthy fame,
         Rainbow she is called, if you would know her name;
         Now the gallant Rainbow she rowes upon the sea,
         Five hundred gallant seamen to bear her company.
    287A.5   The Dutch-man and the Spaniard she made them for to flye,
         Also the bonny French-man, as she met him on the sea:
         When as this gallant Rainbow did come where Ward did lye,
         Where is the captain of this ship? this gallant Rainbow did cry.
    287A.6   O that am I, says Captain Ward, Theres no man bids me lye,
         And if thou art the kings fair ship, thou art welcome unto me:
         Ile tell thee what, says Rainbow, our king is in great grief
         That thou shouldst lye upon the sea and play the arrant thief,
    287A.7   And will not let our merchants ships pass as they did before;
         Such tydings to our king is come, which grieves his heart full sore.
         With that this gallant Rainbow she shot, out of her pride,
         Full fifty gallant brass pieces, charged on every side.
    287A.8   And yet these gallant shooters prevailed not a pin,
         Though they were brass on the out-side, brave Ward was steel within;
         Shoot on, shoot on, says Captain Ward, your sport well pleaseth me,
         And he that first gives over shall yield unto the sea.
    287A.9   I never wrongd an English ship, but Turk and King of Spain,
         For and the jovial Dutch-man as I met on the main.
         If I had known your king but one two years before,
         I would have savd brave Essex life, whose death did grieve me sore.
    287A.10  Go tell the King of England, go tell him thus from me,
         If he reign king of all the land, I will reign king at sea.
         With that the gallant Rainbow shot, and shot, and shot in vain,
         And left the rovers company, and returnd home again.
    287A.11  Our royal king of England, your ships returned again,
         For Wards ship is so strong it never will be tane:
         O everlasting! says our king, I have lost jewels three,
         Which would have gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.
    287A.12  The first was Lord Clifford, Earl of Cumberland;
         The second was the lord Mountjoy, as you shall understand;
         The third was brave Essex, from field would never flee;
         Which would a gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.
