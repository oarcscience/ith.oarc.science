# 273A: King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth


    273A.1   In summer time, when leaves grew green,
         and birds were singing on every tree,
         King Edward would a hunting ride,
         some pastime for to see.
    273A.2   Our king he would a hunting ride,
         by eight a clock of the day,
         And well was he ware of a bold tanner,
         came riding on the way.
    273A.3   A good russet coat the tanner had on,
         fast buttoned under his chin,
         And under him a good cow-hide,
         and a mare of four shilling.
    273A.4   Now stand you here, my good lords all,
         under this trusty tree,
         And I will wend to yonder fellow,
         to know from whence came he.
    273A.5   God speed, God speed, then said our king;
         Thou art welcome, good fellow, quoth he;
         Which is the way to Drayton Basset
         I pray thee shew to me.
    273A.6   The ready way to Drayton Basset,
         from this place as thou dost stand,
         The next pair of gallows thou comst to
         thou must turn up [on] thy right hand.
    273A.7   at is not the way, then said our king,
         The ready way I pray thee shew me;
         Whether thou be thief or true man, quoth the tanner,
         Im weary of thy company.
    273A.8   Away, with a vengeance, qoth the tanner,
         I hold thee out of thy wit,
         For all this day have I ridden and gone,
         And I am fasting yet.
    273A.9   Go with me to Drayton Basset, said our king,
         No daintyes we will lack;
         Wel have meat and drink of the best,
         And I will pay the shot.
    273A.10  Godamercy for nothing, said the tanner,
         Thou shalt pay for no dinner of mine;
         I have more groats and nobles in my purse
         then thou hast pence in thine.
    273A.11  God save your goods, then said the king,
         a+end send them well to thee!
         Be thou thief or true man, quoth the tanner,
         I am weary of thy company.
    273A.12  Away, with a vengeance, quoth the tanner,
         of thee I stand in fear;
         The aparrell thou wearst on thy back
         May seem a good lord to wear.
    273A.13  I never stole them said our king,
         I swear to thee by the rood;
         Thou art some ruffian of the country,
         thou ridst in the midst of thy good.
    273A.14  at news dost thou hear? then said our king,
         I pray what news do you hear?
         I hear no news, answered the tanner,
         But that cow-hides be dear.
    273A.15  Cow-hides? cow-hides? then said our king,
         I marvell what they be;
         Why, art thou a fool? quoth the tanner,
         look, I have one under me.
    273A.16  Yet one thing now I would thee pray,
         so that thou wouldst not be strange;
         If thy mare be better then my steed,
         I pray thee let us change.
    273A.17  But if you needs with me will change,
         As change full well may ye,
         By the faith of my body, quoth the tanner,
         I look to have boot of thee.
    273A.18  What boot wilt thou ask? then said our king,
         what boot dost thou ask on this ground?
         No pence nor half-pence, said the tanner,
         But a noble in gold so round.
    273A.19  Heres twenty good groats, then said the king,
         So well paid see you be;
         I love thee better then I did before,
         I thought thou hadst nere a peny.
    273A.20  But if so be we needs must change,
         as change thou must abide,
         Though thou hast gotten Brock my mare,
         thou shalt not have my cow-hide.
    273A.21  The tanner took the good cow-hide,
         that of the cow was hilt,
         And threw it upon the kings saddle,
         That was so fairly guilt.
    273A.22  Now help me, help me, quoth the tanner,
         Full quickly that I were gone,
         For when I come home to Gillian my wife
         shel say Im a gentleman.
    273A.23  The king took the tanner by the leg,
         he girded a fart so round;
         Your very homely, said the king,
         were I aware, Id laid you o th ground.
    273A.24  But when the tanner was in the kings saddle
         aston d then he was;
         He knew not the stirrops that he did wear,
         whether they were gold or brass.
    273A.25  But when the steed saw the black cow-tale wag,
         for and the black cow-horn,
         The steed began to run away,
         as the divel the tanner had born.
    273A.26  Untill he came unto a nook,
         a little beside an ash;
         The steed gave the tanner such a fall
         his neck was almost brast.
    273A.27  Take thy horse again, with a vengeance, he said,
         with me he shall not abide;
         It is no marvell, said the king, and laught,
         He knew not your cow-hide.
    273A.28  But if that we needs now must change,
         as change that well we mought,
         Ile swear to you plain, if you have your mare,
         I look to have some boot.
    273A.29  What boot will you ask? quoth the tanner,
         What boot will you ask on this ground?
         No pence nor half-pence, said our king,
         But a noble in gold so round.
    273A.30  Heres twenty [good] groats, said the tanner,
         a+end twenty more I have of thine;
         I have ten groats more in my purse,
         wel drink five of them at the wine.
    273A.31  The king set a bugle-horne to his mouth,
         that blew both loud and shrill,
         And five hundred lords and knights
         came riding over a hill.
    273A.32  Away, with a vengeance, quoth the tanner,
         with thee Ile no longer abide;
         Thou art a strong thief, yonder be thy fellows,
         they will steal away my cow-hide.
    273A.33  No I protest, then said our king,
         For so it may not be;
         They be the lords of Drayton Basset,
         come out of the North Country.
    273A.34  But when they came before the king
         full low they fell on their knee;
         The tanner had rather then a thousand pound
         he had been out of his company.
    273A.35  A coller! a coller! then said the king,
         a+e coller! then did he cry;
         Then would he have given a thousand pound
         he had not been so nigh.
    273A.36  A coller? a coller? then quoth the tanner,
         it is a thing which will breed sorrow;
         For after a coller commeth a halter,
         and I shall be hanged tomorrow.
    273A.37  No, do not fear, the king did say;
         For pastime thou hast shown me,
         No coller nor halter thou shalt have,
         but I will give thee a fee.
    273A.38  For Plompton Park I will give thee,
         with tenements three beside,
         Which is worth three hundred pound a year,
         to maintain thy good cow-hide.
    273A.39  Godamercy, Godamercy, quoth the tanner;
         For this good deed thou hast done,
         If ever thou comest to merry Tamworth
         thou shalt have clouting-leather for thy shone.
