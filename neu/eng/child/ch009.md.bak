    9A.3    And as in sorrow thus he lay,

          Refrain:  And she the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.5    And loud to her this knight did crie,
        The salt teares standing in his eye,
          Refrain:  And she the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.6    Faire lady, he said, Take pity on me,
        And let me not in prison dye,
          Refrain:  And you the faire flower of Northumberland.

        And sit like a queene in princely bowers,
    9A.12r  When I am at home in faire Scotland.
    9A.13   Then parted hence this lady gay,
        And got her fathers ring away,
    9A.13r  To helpe this sad knight into faire Scotland.

    9A.15   Two gallant steedes, both good and able,
        She likewise tooke out of the stable,
    9A.15r  To ride with this knight into faire Scotland.
    9A.16   And to the jaylor she sent this ring,
        The knight from prison forth to bring,
    9A.16r  To wend with her into faire Scotland.
    9A.17   This token set the prisoner free,
        Who straight went to this faire lady,
    9A.17r  To wend with her into faire Scotland.
    9A.18   A gallant steede he did bestride,
        And with the lady away did ride,
    9A.18r  And she the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.19   They rode till they came to a water cleare:
        Good Sir, how should I follow you heere,
    9A.19r  And I the faire flower of Northumberland?
    9A.20   The water is rough and wonderfull deepe,
        An[d] on my saddle I shall not keepe,
    9A.20r  And I the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.21   Feare not the foord, faire lady, quoth he,
        For long I cannot stay for thee,
    9A.21r  And thou the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.22   The lady prickt her wanton steed,
        And over the river swom with speede,
    9A.22r  And she the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.23   From top to toe all wet was shee:
        This have I done for love of thee,
    9A.23r  And I the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.24   Thus rode she all one winters night,
        Till Edenborow they saw in sight,
    9A.24r  The chiefest towne in all Scotland.
    9A.25   Now chuse, quoth he, Thou wanton flower,
        Wher thou wilt be my paramour,
    9A.25r  Or get thee home to Northumberland.
    9A.26   For I have wife, and children five,
        In Edenborow they be alive;
    9A.26r  Then get thee home to faire England.
    9A.27   This favour shalt thou have to boote,
        Ile have thy horse, go thou on foote,
    9A.27r  Go, get thee home to Northumberland.
    9A.28   O false and faithlesse knight, quoth shee,
        And canst thou deale so bad with me,
    9A.28r  And I the faire flower of Northumberland?
    9A.29   Dishonour not a ladies name,
        But draw thy sword and end my shame,
    9A.29r  And I the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.30   He tooke her from her stately steed,
        And left her there in extreme need,
    9A.30r  And she the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.31   Then sate she downe full heavily;
        At length two knights came riding by,
    9A.31r  Two gallant knights of faire England.
    9A.32   She fell downe humbly on her knee,
        Saying, Courteous knights, take pittie on me,
    9A.32r  And I the faire flower of Northumberland.
    9A.33   I have offended my father deere,
        And by a false knight that brought me heere,
    9A.33r  From the good Earle of Northumberland.
    9A.34   They tooke her up behind them then,
        And brought her to her fathers againe,
    9A.34r  And he the good Earle of Northumberland.
    9A.35   All you faire maidens be warned by me,
        Scots were never true, nor never will be,
    9A.35r  To lord, nor lady, nor faire England.

    9[G.12r]    Altho she was, etc.
    9[G.13] Out then spoke her stepmother sour,
        She bad her pack off for an impudent whore,
    9[G.13r]    For thou shalt not be heir o Northumberland.
    9[G.14] Out then spock her bastard brother;
        Shell hae nae mair grace than God has gien her,
    9[G.14r]    And she shall be heir o Northumberland.
    9[G.15] Out and spoke her father sae mild,
        Shes no the first maid a false Scot has beguild,
    9[G.15r]    And she shall be, etc.
