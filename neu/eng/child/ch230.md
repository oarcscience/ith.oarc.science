# 230A: The Slaughter of the Laird of Mellerstain


    230A.1   . . . .
         As they came in by the Eden side,
         They heard a lady lamenting sair,
         Bewailing the time she was a bride.
    230A.2   . . . .
         A stately youth of blude and lane,
         . . . .
         John Hately, the laird of Mellerstain.
    230A.3   Cowdenknows, had ye nae lack?
         And Earlstoun, had ye nae shame?
         Ye took him away beside my back,
         But ye never saw to bring him hame.
    230A.4   And she has lookit to Fieldiesha,
         So has she through Yirdandstane;
         She lookit to Earlstoun, and she saw the Fans,
         But hes coming hame by West Gordon.
    230A.5   And she staggerd and she stood,
    230A.6   . . . . . . .
         . . . . .  wude;
         How can I keep in my wits,
         When I look on my husbands blood?
    230A.7   Had we been men as we are women,
         And been at his back when he was slain,
         It should a been tauld for mony a lang year,
         The slaughter o the laird of Mellerstain.
