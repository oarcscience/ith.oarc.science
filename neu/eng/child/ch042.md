# 42A: Clerk Colvill


    42A.1   CLARK COLVEN and his gay ladie,
        As they walked to yon garden green,
        A belt about her middle gimp,
        Which cost Clark Colven crowns fifteen:
    42A.2   O hearken weel now, my good lord,
        O hearken weel to what I say;
        When ye gang to the wall o Stream,
        O gang nae neer the well-fared may.
    42A.3   O haud your tongue, my gay ladie,
        Tak nae sic care o me;
        For I nae saw a fair woman
        I like so well as thee.
    42A.4   He mounted on his berry-brown steed,
        And merry, merry rade he on,
        Till he came to the wall o Stream,
        And there he saw the mermaiden.
    42A.5   Ye wash, ye wash, ye bonny may,
        And ays ye wash your sark o silk:
        Its a for you, ye gentle knight,
        My skin is whiter than the milk.
    42A.6   Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
        Hes taen her by the sleeve sae green,
        And hes forgotten his gay ladie,
        And away with the fair maiden.
        * * * * *
    42A.7   Ohon, alas! says Clark Colven,
        And aye sae sairs I mean my head!
        And merrily leugh the mermaiden,
        O win on till you be dead.
    42A.8   But out ye tak your little pen-knife,
        And frae my sark ye shear a gare;
        Row that about your lovely head,
        And the pain yell never feel nae mair.
    42A.9   Out he has taen his little pen-knife,
        And frae her sark hes shorn a gare,
        Rowed that about his lovely head,
        But the pain increased mair and mair.
    42A.10  Ohon, alas! says Clark Colven,
        An aye sae sairs I mean my head!
        And merrily laughd the mermaiden,
        It will ay be war till ye be dead.
    42A.11  Then out he drew his trusty blade,
        And thought wi it to be her dead,
        But shes become a fish again,
        And merrily sprang into the fleed.
    42A.12  Hes mounted on his berry-brown steed,
        And dowy, dowy rade he home,
        And heavily, heavily lighted down
        When to his ladies bower-door he came.
    42A.13  Oh, mither, mither, mak my bed,
        And, gentle ladie, lay me down;
        Oh, brither, brither, unbend my bow,
        Twill never be bent by me again.
    42A.14  His mither she has made his bed,
        His gentle ladie laid him down,
        His brither he has unbent his bow,
        Twas never bent by him again.

### 42B: Clerk Colvill


    42B.1   CLERK COLVILL and his lusty dame
        Were walking in the garden green;
        The belt around her stately waist
        Cost Clerk Colvill of pounds fifteen.
    42B.2   O promise me now, Clerk Colvill,
        Or it will cost ye muckle strife,
        Ride never by the wells of Slane,
        If ye wad live and brook your life.
    42B.3   Now speak nae mair, my lusty dame,
        Now speak nae mair of that to me;
        Did I neer see a fair woman,
        But I wad sin with her body?
    42B.4   Hes taen leave o his gay lady,
        Nought minding what his lady said,
        And hes rode by the wells of Slane,
        Where washing was a bonny maid.
    42B.5   Wash on, wash on, my bonny maid,
        That wash sae clean your sark of silk;
        And weel fa you, fair gentleman,
        Your body whiter than the milk.
        * * * * *
    42B.6   Then loud, loud cryd the Clerk Colvill,
        O my head it pains me sair;
        Then take, then take, the maiden said,
        And frae my sark youll cut a gare.
    42B.7   Then shes gied him a little bane-knife,
        And frae her sark he cut a share;
        Shes tyd it round his whey-white face,
        But ay his head it aked mair.
    42B.8   Then louder cryd the Clerk Colvill,
        O sairer, sairer akes my head;
        And sairer, sairer ever will,
        The maiden crys, Till you be dead.
    42B.9   Out then he drew his shining blade,
        Thinking to stick her where she stood,
        But she was vanishd to a fish,
        And swam far off, a fair mermaid.
    42B.10  O mother, mother, braid my hair;
        My lusty lady, make my bed;
        O brother, take my sword and spear,
        For I have seen the false mermaid.

### 42C: Clerk Colvill


    42C.1   CLERK COLIN and his mother dear
        Were in the garden green;
        The band that was about her neck
        Cost Colin pounds fifteen;
        The belt about her middle sae sma
        Cost twice as much again.
    42C.2   Forbidden gin ye wad be, love Colin,
        Forbidden gin ye wad be,
        And gang nae mair to Clydes water,
        To court yon gay ladie.
    42C.3   Forbid me frae your ha, mother,
        Forbid me frae your bour,
        But forbid me not frae yon ladie;
        Shes fair as ony flour.
    42C.4   Forbidden I winna be, mother,
        Forbidden I winna be,
        For I maun gang to Clydes water,
        To court yon gay ladie.
    42C.5   An he is on his saddle set,
        As fast as he could win,
        An he is on to Clydes water,
        By the lee licht o the moon.
    42C.6   An when he cam to the Clydes water
        He lichted lowly down,
        An there he saw the mermaiden,
        Washin silk upon a stane.
    42C.7   Come down, come down, now, Clerk Colin,
        Come down an [fish] wi me;
        Ill row ye in my arms twa,
        An a foot I sanna jee.
        * * * * *
    42C.8   O mother, mother, mak my bed,
        And, sister, lay me doun,
        An brother, tak my bow an shoot,
        For my shooting is done.
    42C.9   He wasna weel laid in his bed,
        Nor yet weel faen asleep,
        When up an started the mermaiden,
        Just at Clerk Colins feet.
    42C.10  Will ye lie there an die, Clerk Colin,
        Will ye lie there an die?
        Or will ye gang to Clydes water,
        To fish in flood wi me?
    42C.11  I will lie here an die, he said,
        I will lie here an die;
        In spite o a the deils in hell
        I will lie here an die.
