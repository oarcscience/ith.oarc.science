# 172A: Musselburgh Field


    172A.1   ON the tenth day of December,
         And the fourth yeere of King Edwards raigne,
         Att Musleboorrowe, as I remember,
         Two goodly hosts there mett on a plaine.
    172A.2   All that night they camped there,
         Soe did the Scotts, both stout and stubborne;
         But "[wellaway,"] it was their song,
         For wee haue taken them in their owne turne.
    172A.3   Over night they carded for our English mens coates;
         They fished before their netts were spunn;
         A white for sixpence, a red for two groates;
         Now wisdome wold haue stayed till they had been woone.
    172A.4   Wee feared not but that they wold fight,
         Yett itt was turned vnto their owne paine;
         Thoe against one of vs that they were eight,
         Yett with their owne weapons wee did them beat.
    172A.5   On the twelfth day in the morne
         The made a face as the wold fight,
         But many a proud Scott there was downe borne,
         And many a ranke coward was put to flight.
    172A.6   But when they heard our great gunnes cracke,
         Then was their harts turned into their hose;
         They cast down their weapons, and turned their backes,
         They ran soe fast  that the fell on their nose.
    172A.7   The Lord Huntley, wee had him there;
         With him hee brought ten thousand men,
         Yett, God bee thanked, wee made them such a banquett
         That none of them returned againe.
    172A.8   Wee chased them to D[alkeith]
         * * * * *
