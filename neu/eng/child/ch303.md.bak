# 303A: The Holy Nunnery


    303A.1   FAIR ANNIE had a costly bower,
         Well built wi lime and stane,
         And Willie came to visit her,
         Wit the light o the meen.
    303A.2   When he came to Annies bower-door,
         He tirled at the pin:
         Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Fair Annie,
         Yell open, lat me come in.
    303A.3   O never a fit, says Fair Annie,
         Till I your errand ken;
         My fathers vowed a vow, Annie,
         Ill tell you when Im in.
    303A.4   My fathers vowed a rash vow,
         I darena marry thee;
         My mithers vowed anither vow,
         My bride yese never be.
    303A.5   If ye had tauld me that, Willie,
         When we began to woo,
         There was naithing in this warld wide
         Shoud drawn my love to you.
    303A.6   A nun, a nun, said Fair Annie,
         A nun will I be then;
         A priest, a priest, said Sweet Willie,
         A priest will I be syne.
    303A.7   She is gane to her father,
         For mither she had nane;
         And she is on to her father,
         To see if shed be a nun.
    303A.8   An asking, asking, father dear,
         An asking yell grant me;
         Thats to get to the holy nunnery,
         And there to live or die.
    303A.9   Your askings nae sae great, daughter,
         But granted it shall be;
         For yese won to the holy nunnery,
         There to live or die.
    303A.10  Then they gaed on, and farther on,
         Till they came to the yate;
         And there they spied a maiden porter,
         Wi gowd upon her hat.
    303A.11  An asking, asking, maiden porter,
         An asking yell grant me;
         If Ill won to the holy nunnery,
         There to live or die.
    303A.12  Your askings nae sae great, lady,
         But granted it shall be;
         For yese won to the holy nunnery,
         There to live or die.
    303A.13  But ye maun vow a vow, lady,
         Before that ye seek in;
         Never to kiss a young mans mouth
         That goes upon the grun.
    303A.14  And ye must vow anither vow,
         Severely ye must work;
         The well-warst vow that yere to vow,
         Is never to gang to kirk.
    303A.15  I will vow a vow, she said,
         Before that I seek in;
         I neer shall kiss a young mans mouth
         That goes upon the grun.
    303A.16  And I will vow anither vow,
         Severly I will work;
         The well-warst vow that Im to vow
         Is never to gang to kirk.
    303A.17  For seven years now Fair Annie,
         In the holy nunnery lay she,
         And seven years Sweet Willie lay,
         In languish like to die.
    303A.18  Is there nae duke no lords daughter,
         My son, can comfort thee,
         And save thee frae the gates o death?
         Is there nae remedie?
    303A.19  There is nae duke nor lords daughter,
         Mother, can cofort me,
         Except it be my love, Annie,
         In the holy nunnery lies she.
    303A.20  Theyve dressd Sweet Willie up in silk,
         Wi gowd his gown did shine,
         And nane coud ken by his pale face
         But he was a lady fine.
    303A.21  So they gaed on, and farther on,
         Till they came to the yate,
         And there they spied a maiden porter,
         Wi gowd upon her hat.
    303A.22  An asking, an asking, maiden porter,
         An asking yell grant me;
         For to win in to the holy nunnery,
         Fair Annie for to see.
    303A.23  Your askings nae sae great, lady,
         But granted it shall be;
         Yese won into the holy nunnery,
         Fair Annie for to see.
    303A.24  Be she dukes or lords daughter,
         Its lang sin she came here:
         Fair Annie kent her true loves face;
         Says, Come up, my sister dear.
    303A.25  Sweet Willie went to kiss her lips,
         As he had wont to do;
         But she softly whispered him,
         I darena this avow.
