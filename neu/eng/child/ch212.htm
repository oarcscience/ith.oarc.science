212A.4	 O he&#146;s gone to yon tavern-house,
	 An counted owre his lawin,
	 When in there cam three armed men,
	 To meet him in the dawin.
212A.5	 &#145;O woe be unto woman&#146;s wit!
	 It has beguiled many;

	 But she sent three men to slay me.&#146;

212B.1	 &#145;YE are the Duke of Athol&#146;s nurse,
	 And I&#146;m the new-come darling;
	 I&#146;ll gie you my gay gold rings
	 To get ae word of my leman.&#146;
212B.2	 &#145;I am the Duke Athol&#146;s nurse,
	 And ye&#146;re the new-come darling;
	 Keep well your gay gold rings,
	 Ye sall get twa words o your leman.&#146;
212B.3	 He leand oure his saddle-bow,
	 It was not for to kiss her:
	 &#145;Anither woman has my heart,
	 And I but come here to see ye.&#146;
212B.4	 &#145;If anither woman has your heart,
	 O dear, but I am sorry!
	 Ye hie you down to yon ale house,
	 And stay untill &#146;t be dawing,
	 And if I be a woman true
	 I&#146;ll meet you in the dawing.&#146;
212B.5	 He did him down to yon ale-house,
	 And drank untill &#146;t was dawing;
	 He drank the bonnie lassie&#146;s health
	 That was to clear his lawing.
212B.6	 He lookit out of a shot-window,
	 To see if she was coming,
	 And there he seed her seven brithers,
	 So fast as they were running!
212B.7	 He went up and down the house,
	 Says, &#145;Landlady, can you save me?
	 For yonder comes her seven brithers,
	 And they are coming to slay me.&#146;
212B.8	 So quick she minded her on a wile
	 How she might protect him!
	 She dressd him in a suit of woman&#146;s attire
	 And set him to her baking.
212B.9	 &#145;Had you a quarterer here last night,
	 Or staid he to the dawing?
	 Shew us the room the squire lay in,
	 We are come to clear his lawing.&#146;
212B.10	 &#145;I had a quarterer here last night,
	 But he staid not to the dawing;
	 He called for a pint, and paid as he went,
	 You have nothing to do with his lawing.&#146;
212B.11	 They searchd the house baith up and down,
	 The curtains they spaird not to rive em,
	 And twenty times they passd
	 The squire at his baking.

212C.1	 AS I went down by the Duke of Athole&#146;s gates,
	 Where the bells of the court were ringing,
	 And there I heard a fair maid say,
	 O if I had but ae sight o my Johnie!
212C.2	 &#145;O here is your Johnie just by your side;
	 What have ye to say to your Johnie?
	 O here is my hand, but anither has my heart,
	 So ye&#146;ll never get more o your Johnie.&#146;
212C.3	 &#145;O ye may go down to yon ale-house,
	 And there do sit till the dawing;
	 And call for the wine that is very, very fine,
	 And I&#146;ll come and clear up your lawing.&#146;
212C.4	 So he&#146;s gane down to yon ale-house,
	 And he has sat till the dawing;
	 And he&#146;s calld for the wine that&#146;s very, very fine,
	 But she neer cam to clear up his lawing.
212C.5	 Lang or the dawing he oure the window looks,
	 To see if his true-love was coming,
	 And there he spied twelve weel armd boys,
	 Coming over the plainstanes running.
212C.6	 &#145;O landlady, landlady, what shall I do?
	 For my life it&#146;s not worth a farthing!&#146;
	 &#145;O young man,&#146; said she, &#146;Tak counsel by me,
	 And I will be your undertaking.
212C.7	 &#145;I will clothe you in my own body-clothes
	 And I&#146;ll send you like a girl to the baking:&#146;
	 And loudly, loudly they rapped at the door,
	 And loudly, loudly they rapp d.
212C.8	 &#145;O had you any strangers here late last night?
	 Or were they lang gane or the dawing?
	 O had you any strangers here late last night?
	 We are now come to clear up his lawing.&#146;
212C.9	 &#145;O I had a stranger here late last night,
	 But he was lang gane or the dawing;
	 He called for a pint, and he paid it as he went,
	 And ye&#146;ve no more to do with his lawing.&#146;
212C.10	 &#145;O show me the room that your stranger lay in,
	 If he was lang gane or the dawing:&#146;
	 She showed them the room that her stranger lay in,
	 But he was lang gane or the dawing.
212C.11	 O they stabbed the feather-bed all round and round,
	 And the curtains they neer stood to tear them;
	 And they gade as they cam, and left a&#146; things undone,
	 And left the young squire by his baking.

212D.1	 AS I cam in by the Duke of Athole&#146;s gate,
	 I heard a fair maid singing,
	 Wi a bonny baby on her knee,
	 And the bells o the court were ringing.
212D.2	 &#145;O it&#146;s I am the Duke of Athole&#146;s nurse,
	 And the place does well become me;
	 But I would gie a&#146; my half-year&#146;s fee
	 Just for a sight o my Johnie.
	 * * * * *
212D.3	 &#145;If ye&#146;ll gae down to yon ale-house,
	 And stop till it be dawing,
	 And ca for a pint o the very, very best,
	 And I&#146;ll come and clear up your lawing.&#146;

	 But she cam na to clear up his lawing.
212D.5	 He looked out at the chamber-window,
	 To see if she was coming;
	 And there he spied ten armed men,
	 Across the plain coming running.
212D.6	 &#145;O landlady, landlady, what shall I do?
	 For my life is not worth a farthing;
	 I paid you a guinea for my lodging last night,
	 But I fear I&#146;ll never see sun shining.&#146;
212D.7	 &#145;If ye will be advised by me,
	 I&#146;ll be your undertaking;
	 I&#146;ll dress you up in my ain body-clothes

	 Or is he within your dwelling?&#146;
212D.9	 &#145;O I had a stranger here last night,
	 But he wos gane or dawing;
	 He ca&#146;d for a pint, and he paid it or he went,
	 And I hae nae mair to do wi his lawing.&#146;

	 The curtains they spared na to tear them;
	 But they went as they came, and left a&#146; things undone,
	 And the young man busy baking.

212F.1	 AS I gaed in yon greenwood-side,
	 I heard a fair maid singing;
	 Her voice was sweet, she sang sae complete
	 That all the woods were ringing.
212F.2	 &#145;O I&#146;m the duke o Athole&#146;s nurse,
	 My post is well becoming;
	 But I woud gie a&#146; my half-year&#146;s fee
	 For ae sight o my leman.&#146;
212F.3	 &#145;Ye say, ye&#146;re the Duke o Athole&#146;s nurse,
	 Your post is well becoming;
	 Keep well, keep well your half-year&#146;s fee,
	 Ye&#146;se hae twa sights o your leman.&#146;
212F.4	 He leand him ower his saddle-bow
	 And cannilie kissd his dearie:
	 &#145;Ohon and alake! anither has my heart,
	 And I darena mair come near thee.&#146;
212F.5	 &#145;Ohon and alake! if anither hae your heart,
	 These words hae fairly undone me;
	 But let us set a time, tryst to meet again,
	 Then in gude friends you will twine me.
212F.6	 &#145;Ye will do you down to yon tavern-house
	 And drink till the day be dawing,
	 And, as sure as I ance had a love for you,
	 I&#146;ll come there and clear your lawing.
212F.7	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll spare not the wine, altho it be fine,
	 Nae Malago, tho it be rarely,
	 But ye&#146;ll aye drink the bonnie lassie&#146;s health
	 That&#146;s to clear your lawing fairly.&#146;
212F.8	 Then he&#146;s done him down to yon tavern-house
	 And drank till day was dawing,
	 And aye he drank the bonnie lassie&#146;s health
	 That was coming to clear his lawing.
212F.9	 And aye as he birled, and aye as he drank,
	 The gude beer and the brandy,
	 He spar&#146;d not the wine, altho it was fine,
	 The sack nor the sugar candy.
212F.10	 &#145;It&#146;s a wonder to me,&#146; the knight he did say,
	 &#145;My bonnie lassie&#146;s sae delaying;
	 She promised, as sure as she loved me ance,
	 She woud be here by the dawing.&#146;
212F.11	 He&#146;s done him to a shott-window,
	 A little before the dawing,
	 And there he spied her nine brothers bauld,
	 Were coming to betray him.
212F.12	 &#145;Where shall I rin? where shall I gang?
	 Or where shall I gang hide me?
	 She that was to meet me in friendship this day
	 Has sent nine men to slay me!&#146;
212F.13	 He&#146;s gane to the landlady o the house,
	 Says, &#145;O can you supply me?
	 For she that was to meet me in friendship this day
	 Has sent nine men to slay me.&#146;
212F.14	 She gae him a suit o her ain female claise
	 And set him to the baking;
	 The bird never sang mair sweet on the bush
	 Nor the knight sung at the baking.
212F.15	 As they came in at the ha-door,
	 Sae loudly as they rappit!
	 And when they came upon the floor,
	 Sae loudly as they chappit!
212F.16	 &#145;O had ye a stranger here last night,
	 Who drank till the day was dawing?
	 Come show us the chamber where he lyes in,
	 We&#146;ll shortly clear his lawing.&#146;
212F.17	 &#145;I had nae stranger here last night
	 That drank till the day was dawing;
	 But ane that took a pint, and paid it ere he went,
	 And there&#146;s naething to clear o his lawing.&#146;
212F.18	 A lad among the rest, being o a merry mood,
	 To the young knight fell a-talking;
	 The wife took her foot and gae him a kick,
	 Says, Be busy, ye jilt, at your baking.
212F.19	 They stabbed the house baith but and ben,
	 The curtains they spared nae riving,
	 And for a&#146; that they search and ca,
	 For a kiss o the knight they were striving.
