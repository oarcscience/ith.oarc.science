# 40: The Queen of Elfan’s Nourice


    40.1    I HEARD a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
        An a cow low down in yon glen;
        Lang, lang will my young son greet
        Or his mither bid him come ben.
    40.2    I heard a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
        An a cow low down in yon fauld;
        Lang, lang will my young son greet
        Or his mither take him frae cauld.
        * * * * *
    40.3    . . . . .
        . . . .
        Waken, Queen of Elfan,
        An hear your nourice moan.
    40.4    O moan ye for your meat,
        Or moan ye for your fee,
        Or moan ye for the ither bounties
        That ladies are wont to gie?
    40.5    I moan na for my meat,
        Nor moan I for my fee,
        Nor moan I for the ither bounties
        That ladies are wont to gie.
    40.6    . . . . .
        . . . . .
        But I moan for my young son
        I left in four nights auld.
    40.7    I moan na for my meat,
        Nor yet for my fee,
        But I mourn for Christen land,
        Its there I fain would be.
    40.8    O nurse my bairn, nourice, she says,
        Till he stan at your knee,
        An yes win hame to Christen land,
        Whar fain its ye wad be.
    40.9    O keep my bairn, nourice,
        Till he gang by the hauld,
        An yes win hame to your young son
        Ye left in four nights auld.
        * * * * *
    40.10   O nourice lay your head
        Upo my knee:
        See ye na that narrow road
        Up by yon tree?
    40.11   . . . . . .
        . . . . .
        Thats the road the righteous goes,
        And thats the road to heaven.
    40.12   An see na ye that braid road,
        Down by yon sunny fell?
        Yons the road the wicked gae,
        An thats the road to hell.
        * * * * *
