# 140A: Robin Hood Rescuing Three Squires


    140A.*   * * *
         . . . . . . . .
         In faith thou shal[t] haue mine,
         And twenty pound in thy purse,
         To spend att ale and wine.
    140A.2   Though your clothes are of light Lincolne green,
         And mine gray russett and torne,
         Yet it doth not you beseeme
         To doe an old man scorne.
    140A.3   I scorne thee not, old man, says Robin,
         By the faith of my body;
         Doe of thy clothes, thou shalt haue mine,
         For it may noe better bee.
    140A.4   But Robin did on this old mans hose,
         The were torne in the wrist;
         When I looke on my leggs, said Robin,
         Then for to laugh I list.
    140A.5   But Robin did on the old mans shooes,
         And the were cliitt full cleane;
         Now, by my faith, sayes Litle Iohn,
         These are good for thornes keene.
    140A.6   But Robin did on the old mans cloake,
         And it was torne in the necke;
         Now, by my faith, said William Scarlett,
         Heere shold be set a specke.
    140A.7   But Robin did on this old mans hood,
         Itt gogled on his crowne;
         When I come into Nottingham, said Robin,
    RRMrry     hood it will lightly downe.
    140A.8   But yonder is an outwood, said Robin,
         An outwood all and a shade,
         And thither I reede you, my merrymen all,
         The ready way to take.
    140A.9   And when you heare my litle horne blow,
         Come raking all on a rowte
         . . . .
         . . . .
         * * * * *
    140A.10  But Robin he lope, and Robin he threw,
         He lope over stocke and stone;
         But those that saw Robin Hood run
         Said he was a liuer old man.
    140A.11  [Then Robin set his] horne to his mowth,
         A loud blast cold h[e] blow;
         Ffull three hundred bold yeomen
         Came rakinge all on a row.
    140A.12  But  Robin cast downe his baggs of bread,
         Soe did he his staffe with a face,
         And in a doublet of red veluett
         This yeoman stood in his place.
    140A.13  But bend your bowes, and stroke your strings,
         Set the gallow-tree aboute,
         And Christs cursse on his heart, said Robin,
         That spares the sheriffe and the sergiant!
    140A.14  When the sheriffe see gentle Robin wold shoote,
         He held vp both his hands;
         Sayes, Aske, good Robin, and thou shalt haue,
         Whether it be house or land.
    140A.15  I will neither haue house nor land, said Robin,
         Nor gold, nor none of thy fee,
         But I will haue those three squires
         To the greene forest with me.
    140A.16  Now marry, Gods forbott, said the sheriffe,
         That euer that shold bee;
         For why, they be the kings felons,
         They are all condemned to dye.
    140A.17  But grant me my askinge, said Robin,
         Or by the faith of my body
         Thou shalt be the first man
         Shall flower this gallow-tree.
    140A.18  But I wi[ll haue t]hose three squires
         . . . .

### 140B: Robin Hood Rescuing Three Squires


    140B.1   THERE are twelve months in all the year,
         As I hear many men say,
         But the merriest month in all the year
         Is the merry month of May.
    140B.2   Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,
         With a link a down and a day,
         And there he met a silly old woman,
         Was weeping on the way.
    140B.3   What news? what news, thou silly old woman?
         What news hast thou for me?
         Said she, Theres three squires in Nottingham town
         To-day is condemned to die.
    140B.4   O have they parishes burnt? he said,
         Or have they ministers slain?
         Or have they robbed any virgin,
         Or with other mens wives have lain?
    140B.5   They have no parishes burnt, good sir,
         Nor yet have ministwrs slain,
         Nor have they robbed any virgin,
         Nor with other mens wives have lain.
    140B.6   O what have they done? said bold Robin Hood,
         I pray thee tell to me:
         Its for slaying of the kings fallow deer,
         Bearing their long bows with thee.
    140B.7   Dost thou not mind, old woman, he said,
         Since thou made me sup and dine?
         By the truth of my body, quoth bold Robin Hood,
         You could not tell it in better time.
    140B.8   Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,
         With a link a down and a day,
         And there he met a silly old palmer,
         Was walking along the highway.
    140B.9   What news? what news, thou silly old man?
         What news, I do thee pray?
         Said he, Three squires in Nottingham town
         Are condemnd to die this day.
    140B.10  Come change thy apparel with me, old man,
         Come change thy apparel for mine;
         Here is forty shillings in good silver,
         Go drink it in beer or wine.
    140B.11  O thine apparel is good, he said,
         And mine is ragged and torn;
         Whereever you go, wherever you ride,
         Laugh neer an old man to scorn.
    140B.12  Come change thy apparel with me, old churl,
         Come change thy apparel with mine;
         Here are twenty pieces of good broad gold,
         Go feast thy brethren with wine.
    140B.13  Then he put on the old mans hat,
         It stood full high on the crown:
         The first bold bargain that I come at,
         It shall make thee come down.
    140B.14  Then he put on the old mans cloak,
         Was patchd black, blew, and red;
         He thought no shame all the day long
         To wear the bags of bread.
    140B.15  Then he put on the old mans breeks,
         Was patchd from ballup to side;
         By the truth of my body, bold Robin can say,
         This man lovd little pride.
    140B.16  Then he put on the old mans hose,
         Were patchd from knee to wrist;
         By the truth of my body, said bold Robin Hood,
         Id laugh if I had any list.
    140B.17  Then he put on the old mans shoes,
         Were patchd both beneath and aboon;
         Then Robin Hood swore a solemn oath,
         Its good habit that makes a man.
    140B.18  Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,
         With a link a down and a down,
         And there he met with the proud sheriff,
         Was walking along the town.
    140B.19  O save, O save, O sheriff, he said,
         O save, and you may see!
         And what will you give to a silly old man
         To-day will your hangman be?
    140B.20  me suits, some suits, the sheriff he said,
         Some suits Ill give to thee;
         Some suits, some suits, and pence thirteen
         To-days a hangmans fee.
    140B.21  Then Robin he turns him round about,
         And jumps from stock to stone;
         By the truth of my body, the sheriff he said,
         Thats well jumpt, thou nimble old man.
    140B.22  I was neer a hangman in all my life,
         Nor yet intends to trade;
         But curst be he, said bold Robin,
         That first a hangman was made.
    140B.23  Ive a bag for meal, and a bag for malt,
         And a bag for barley and corn;
         A bag for bread, and a bag for beef,
         And a bag for my little small horn.
    140B.24  I have a horn in my pocket,
         I got it from Robin Hood,
         And still when I set it to my mouth,
         For thee it blows little good.
    140B.25  O wind thy horn, thou proud fellow,
         Of thee I have no doubt;
         I wish that thou give such a blast
         Till both thy eyes fall out.
    140B.26  The first loud blast that he did blow,
         He blew both loud and shrill;
         A hundred and fifty of Robin Hoods men
         Came riding over the hill.
    140B.27  The next loud blast that he did give,
         He blew both loud and amain,
         And quickly sixty of Robin Hoods men
         Came shining over the plain.
    140B.28  O who are yon, the sheriff he said,
         Come tripping over the lee?
         There my attendants, brave Robin did say,
         Theyll pay a visit to thee.
    140B.29  They took the gallows from the slack,
         They set it in the glen,
         They hangd the proud sheriff on that,
         Releasd their own three men.

### 140C: Robin Hood Rescuing Three Squires


    140C.1   BOLD Robin Hood ranging the forest all round,
         The forest all round ranged he;
         O there did he meet with a gay lady,
         She came weeping along the highway.
    140C.2   Why weep you, why weep you? bold Robin he said,
         What, weep you for gold or fee?
         Or do you weep for your maidenhead,
         That is taken from your body?
    140C.3   I weep not for gold, the lady replyed,
         Neither do I weep for fee;
         Nor do I weep for my maidenhead,
         That is taken from my body.
    140C.4   What weep you for then? said jolly Robin,
         I prithee come tell unto me;
         Oh! I do weep for my three sons,
         For they are all condemned to die.
    140C.5   What church have they robbed? said jolly Robin,
         Or parish-priest have they slain?
         What maids have they forced against their will?
         Or with other mens wives have lain?
    140C.6   No church have they robbd, this lady replied,
         Nor parish-priest have they slain;
         No maids have they forcd against their will,
         Nor with other mens wives have lain.
    140C.7   What have they done then? said jolly Robin,
         Come tell me most speedily:
         Oh! it is for killing the kings fallow deer,
         And they are all condemned to die.
    140C.8   Get you home, get you home, said jolly Robin,
         Get you home most speedily,
         And I will unto fair Nottingham go,
         For the sake of the squires all three.
    140C.9   Then bold Robin Hood for Nottingham goes,
         For Nottingham town goes he,
         O there did he meet with a poor beggar-man,
         He came creeping along the highway.
    140C.10  What news, what news, thou old beggar-man?
         What news, come tell unto me:
         O there is weeping and wailing in fair Nottingham,
         For the death of the squires all three.
    140C.11  This beggar-man had a coat on his back,
         Twas neither green, yellow, nor red;
         Bold Robin Hood thought twas no disgrace
         To be in a beggar-mans stead.
    140C.12  Come, pull off thy coat, you old beggar-man,
         And you shall put on mine;
         And forty good shillings Ill give thee to boot,
         Besides brandy, good beer, ale and wine.
    140C.13  Bold Robin Hood then unto Nottingham came,
         Unto Nottingham town came he;
         O there did he meet with great master sheriff,
         And likewise the squires all three.
    140C.14  One boon, one boon, says jolly Robin,
         One boon I beg on my knee;
         That, as for the deaths of these three squires,
         Their hangman I may be.
    140C.15  Soon granted, soon granted, says great master sheriff,
         Soon granted unto thee;
         And you shall have all their gay cloathing,
         Aye, and all their white money.
    140C.16  O I will have none of their gay cloathing,
         Nor none of their white money,
         But Ill have three blasts on my bugle-horn,
         That their souls to heaven may flee.
    140C.17  Then Robin Hood mounted the gallows so high,
         Where he blew loud and shrill,
         Till an hundred and ten of Robin Hoods men
         They came marching all down the green hill.
    140C.18  Whose men are they all these? says great master sheriff,
         Whose men are they? tell unto me:
         O they are mine, but none of thine,
         And theyre come for the squires all three.
    140C.19  O take them, O take them, says great master sheriff,
         O take them along with thee;
         For theres never a man in all Nottingham
         Can do the like of thee.
