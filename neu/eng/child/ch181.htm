181B.1	 &#145;OPEN the gates,
	 and let him come in;
	 He is my brother Huntly,
	 he&#146;ll do him nae harm.&#146;
181B.2	 The gates they were opent,
	 they let him come in,
	 But fause traitor Huntly,
	 he did him great harm.
181B.3	 He&#146;s ben and ben,
	 and ben to his bed,
	 And with a sharp rapier
	 he stabbed him dead.
181B.4	 The lady came down the stair,
	 wringing her hands:
	 &#145;He has slain the Earl o Murray,
	 the flower o Scotland.&#146;
181B.5	 But Huntly lap on his horse,
	 rade to the king:

	 and whare hae ye been?

	 and how hae ye sped?&#146;
	 &#145;I&#146;ve killed the Earl o Murray,
	 dead in his bed.&#146;
181B.7	 &#145;Foul fa you, Huntly!
	 and why did ye so?
	 You might have taen the Earl o Murray,
	 and saved his life too.&#146;
181B.8	 &#145;Her bread it&#146;s to bake,
	 her yill is to brew;
	 My sister&#146;s a widow,
	 and sair do I rue.
181B.9	 &#145;Her corn grows ripe,
	 her meadows grow green,
	 But in bonny Dinnibristle
	 I darena be seen.&#146;
