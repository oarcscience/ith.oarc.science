         Ive laid my love on you, and told you my mind.
    238E.8   Then reading the letter, as he stood on the green,

    238E.10  When she heard this answer, her heart was like to break,

    238E.17  But her fathers old chaplain, a man of great skill,
         He wrote a broad letter, and penned it well.
    238E.18  Saying, O brave Glenlogie, why must it be so?
         A maids love laid on you, shall she die in her woe?
    238E.19  Then reading the letter, his heart was like to break
         That such a leal virgin should die for his sake.
    238E.20  Then he calld on his footman, and likewise his groom,
         Says, Get my horse saddled and bridl d soon.
    238E.21  Before the horse was saddled and brought to the yate,
         Bonnie Glenlogie was five miles on foot.
    238E.22  When he came to Bethelnie, he saw nothing there
         But weeping and wailing, vexation and care.
    238E.23  Then out spake her father, with the tear in his ee,
         Youre welcome, Glenlogie, youre welcome to me.
    238E.24  If ye make me welcome, as welcomes ye say,
         Yell show me the chamber where Jeannie does lay.
    238E.25  Then one o her maidens took him by the hand,
         To show him the chamber where Jeannie lay in.
    238E.26  Before that she saw him, she was pale and wan;
         But when she did see him, she grew ruddy again.
    238E.27  O turn, bonny Jeannie, turn you to your side;
         For Ill be the bridegroom, and yell be the bride.

         Bonny Jean o Bethelnie was fifteen years auld.

### 238F: Glenlogie or Jean o Bethalnie


    238F.1   FOURSCORE nobles ride in the kings court,
         And bonny Earl Ogies the flower of the rout;
         Fourscore lean oer the castle-wa,
         But Jean of Bethelnies the flower of em a.
    238F.2   She writ a broad letter, and pennd it fou lang,
         And sent it Earl Ogie as fast as t can gang:

    238F.3   O pox on thee, Jenny, for being sae slaw!
         Bonny Earl Ogie is promisd awa:
         This letter was like to mak her heart break,
         For revealing her mind to a man so ingrate.
    238F.4   Come here, all my handmaids, O do this with speed,
         Take my gowns and my passments, and lay me to bed;
         Lay me to bed, it is all that I crave;
         Wi my sark in my coffin, lay me in my grave.
    238F.5   Her father beheld her with heart full of grief,
         And spoke these words to her, to gi her relief:
         Hawd your tongue, Jenny, your mourning let be,
         You shall have drumfinely, whos as good as he.
    238F.6   Haud your tongue, father, your words make me sad;
         If I get not Earl Ogie, I still shall be bad;
         With his bonny streight body, and black rolling eee,
         If I get not Earl Ogie, for him I mun dee.
    238F.7   Her father, kings chaplain, and one of great skill,
         Did write a broad letter, and pennd it fou weel;
         He as writ a broad letter, and pennd it fou lang,
         And sent it Earl Ogie as fast as t can gang.
    238F.8   Bonny Earl Ogie, be courteous and kind;
         My daughter loves you; must she die in her prime?
         When he read the first lines, a loud laugh gave he;
         But or he redd the middle, the tear filld his ee,
    238F.9   Come here, all my footmen, and also my groom,
         Go saddle my horses, and saddle them soon:
         They were not weel saddled and set on the green
         Or bonny Earl Ogie was twa mile his lain.
    238F.10  When he came to Bethelnie, he nothing saw there
         But mourning and weeping, lamentation and care:
         O you thats her handmaid, take me by the hand,
         Lead me to the chamber that Jenny lies in.
    238F.11  When thither he came, she was pale and half dead;
         As soon as she saw him, her cheeks they grew red:
         Come, turn thee, my Jenny, come, turn on thy side,
         Ill be the bridegroom, you shall be the bride.
    238F.12  Her spirit revived to hear him say sae,
         And thus ended luckily all her great wae;
         Then streight were they married, with joy most profound,
         And Jean of Bethelnie was savd from the ground.

         An the young ladye Jeanye, sae gude an sae fair,
         She fancyd Glenlogie aboon a that were there.
    238G.2   She speered at his footman that rode by his side
         His name an his surname an whare he did bide:
         He bides a[t] Glenlogie whan he is at hame,
         He is of the gay Gordons, an John is his name.
    238G.3   Oh, Logie, Glenlogie, Ill tell you my mind;
         My luve is laid on you, O wad ye prove kind!
         He turned him about, as the Gordons do a,
         I thank [you], fair ladye, but Im promised awa.
    238G.4   She called on her maidens her hands for to take,
         An the rings on her fingers she did them a break:
         Oh Logie, Glenlogie! Oh, Logie! said she,
         Gin I get na Glenlogie, Im sure I will die.
    238G.5   O hold your tongue, daughter, an weep na sae sair,
         For yell get Drumfindlay, his fathers young heir.
         O hold your tongue, father, an let me alane,
         Gin I get na Glenlogie, I winna hae ane.
    238G.6   Her father wrote a broad letter wi speed,
         And ordered his footman to run and ride;
         He wrote a broad letter, he wrote it wi skill,
         An sent it to Glenlogie, who had dune her the ill.
    238G.7   The first line that he read, a light laugh gae he;
         The next line that he read, the tear filld his ee:
         O what a man am I, an hae I a maik,
         That such a fine ladye shoud die for my sake?
    238G.8   Yell saddle my horse, an yell saddle him sune,
         An, when he is saddled, bring him to the green:
         His horse was na saddled an brocht to the green,
         When Glenlogie was on the road three miles his lane.
    238G.9   When he came to her fathers, he saw naething there
         But weeping an wailing an sobbing fu sair:
         O pale an wan was she when Logie gaed in,
         But red and ruddie grew she when Logie gaed ben.
    238G.10  O turn, Ladye Jeany, turn ye to your side,
         For Ill be the bridegroom, an yell be the bride:
         It was a blythe wedding as ever Ive seen,
         An bonny Jeany Melville was scarce seventeen.

### 238H: Glenlogie or Jean o Bethalnie


    238H.1   SIX and six nobles gaed to Behelvie fair,
         But bonnie Glenlogie was flowr o a there;
         Bonnie Jean o Belhelvie gaed tripping doun the stair,
         And fancied Glenlogie afore a that was there.
    238H.2   She said to his serving-man, as he stood aside,
         O what is that mans name, and whare does he bide?
         They call him Glenlogie whan he goes frae home,
         But hes come o the grand gordons, and [h]is name is Lord John.
    238H.3   Glenlogie, Glenlogie, be constant and kind;
         Ive laid my love on you, Ill tell you my mind:
         O waes me heart, Jeanie, your tochers oure sma;
         Lay na your love on me, foe Im promised awa.
    238H.4   She called for the servant to show her a room,
         Likewise for a handmaid to mak her bed doun;
         Wi that Jeanies father cam stepping on the floor,
         Says, What is the matter my dochter lies here?
    238H.5   Forgie, honourd father, my folly, said she,
         But for the sake o Glenlogie your dochter will dee:
         O cheer up, my dochter, for Ill gie ye my hand
         That yese get young Glenforbar, w an earldom of land.
    238H.6   O cheer up, my dochter, turn ance frae the wa,
         And yell get Glenforbar, the flowr o them a:
         I wad rather tak Glenlogie wi his staff in his hand
         Afore I wad tak Glenforbar wi an earldom of land.
    238H.7   Jeanies father was a scholar, and a man o grit wit,
         And he wrote him a letter, he thought it was fit.
    238H.8   When Glenlogie gat the letter, he was amang nobles a,
         . . .  he lute his hat fa:
         I wonder i the warld what women see at me,
         For bonnie Jean o Belhelvie is a dying for me:
    238H.9   He calld for his servant to saddle his steed,
         . . . wi speed;
         The horse was na saddled, but out on the green,
         Till bonnie Glenlogie was some miles him leen.
    238H.10  Whan he cam to Belhelvie, he rade round about,
         And he saw Jeanies father at a window look out.
    238H.11  Bonnie Jean o Belhelvie lay pale and wan,
         But red and ruddy grew she when Glenlogie cam in:
         Lie yont, bonnie Jeanie, and let me lie down,
         For yese be bride, and Ise be bridegroom.

### 238I: Glenlogie or Jean o Bethalnie


    238I.1   THERERRrrS fifty young nobles rides up the kings hall
         And bonny Glenlogies the flower of them all;
         Wi his milk-white steed, and his black rolling ee,
         If I get na Glenlogie, its certain Ill die.
    238I.2   Where will I get a bonny boy, to win hose and shoon,
         To go to Glenlogie and bid Logie come?
         Here am I pretty boy, to win baith hose and shoon,
         To go to Glenlogie and bid Logie come.
    238I.3   When he came to Glenlogie, it was wash and go dine:
         Come in, my pretty boy, wash and go dine:
         It was no my fathers fashion, and I hope itll no be mine,
         To run a ladys hasty errand, then to go dine.
    238I.4   Here take this letter, Glenlogie, said he.
         The first ane line that he read, a low smile gave he;
         The next ane line that he read, the tear blinded his ee;
         But the next line that he read he garrd the table flee.
    238I.5   O saddle to me the black horse, saddle to me the brown,
         Saddle to me the swiftest horse that eer rode frae the town:
         But lang or the horses could be brought to the green
         Bonnie Glenlogie was twa mile his lean.
    238I.6   When he came to Glenfeldys gates, little mirth was there,
         Bonie Jeans mother was tearing her hair:
         Youre welcome, Glenlogie, youre welcome to me,
         Youre welcome, Glenlogie, your Jeanie to see.
    238I.7   O pale and wan was she when Logie came in,
         But red and rosy grew she wheneer he sat down;
         O turn you, bonie Jeanie, O turn you to me,
         For, if youll be the bride, the bridegroom I will be.
