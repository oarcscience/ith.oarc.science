# 51A: Lizie Wan


    51A.1   LIZIE WAN sits at her fathers bower-door,
        Weeping and making a mane,
        And by there came her father dear:
        What ails thee, Lizie Wan?
    51A.2   I ail, and I ail, dear father, she said,
        And Ill tell you a reason for why;
        There is a child between my twa sides,
        Between my dear billy and I.
    51A.3   Now Lizie Wan sits at her fathers bower-door,
        Sighing and making a mane,
        And by there came her brother dear:
        What ails thee, Lizie Wan?
    51A.4   I ail, I ail, dear brither, she said,
        And Ill tell you a reason for why;
        There is a child bewteen my twa sides,
        Between you, dear billy, and I.
    51A.5   And hast thou tald father and mother o that?
        And hast thou tald sae o me?
        And he has drawn his gude braid sword,
        That hung down by his knee.

    51A.6   And he has cutted aff Lizie Wans head,
        And her fair body in three,
        And hes awa to his mothers bower,
        And sair aghast was he.
    51A.7   What ails thee, what ails thee, Geordy Wan?
        What ails thee sae fast to rin?
        For I see by thy ill colour
        Some fallows deed thou hast done.
    51A.8   Some fallows deed I have done, mother,
        And I pray you pardon me;
        For Ive cutted aff my greyhounds head;
        He wadna rin for me.
    51A.9   Thy greyhounds bluid was never sae red,
        O my son Geordy Wan!
        For I see by thy ill colour
        Some fallows deed thou hast done.
    51A.10  Some fallows deed I hae done, mother,
        And I pray you pardon me;
        For I hae cutted aff Lizie Wans head
        And her fair body in three.
    51A.11  O what wilt thou do when thy father comes hame,
        O my son Geordy Wan?
        Ill set my foot in a bottomless boat,
        And swim to the sea-ground.
    51A.12  And when will thou come hame again,
        O my son Geordy Wan?
        The sun and the moon shall dance on the green
        That night when I come hame.
