21A.1	THE maid shee went to the well to washe,
      Refrain:	Lillumwham, lillumwham!
	The mayd shee went to the well to washe,
      Refrain:	Whatt then? what then?
	The maid shee went to the well to washe,
	Dew fell of her lilly white fleshe.
      Refrain:	Grandam boy, grandam boy, heye!
	Leg a derry, leg a merry, mett, mer, whoope, whir!
	Driuance, larumben, grandam boy, heye!
21A.2	While shee washte and while shee ronge,
	While shee hangd o the hazle wand.
21A.3	There came an old palmer by the way,
	Sais, &#145;God speed thee well, thou faire maid!&#146;
21A.4	&#145;Hast either cupp or can,
	To giue an old palmer drinke therin?&#146;
21A.5	Sayes, &#145;I have neither cupp nor cann,
	To giue an old palmer drinke therin.&#146;
21A.6	&#145;But an thy lemman came from Roome,
	Cupps and canns thou wold find soone.&#146;
21A.7	She sware by God & good St. John,
	Lemman had shee neuer none.
21A.8	Sais, &#145;Peace, faire mayd, you are forsworne!
	Nine children you haue borne.
21A.9	&#145;Three were buryed vnder thy bed&#146;s head,
	Other three vnder thy brewing leade.
21A.10	&#145;Other three on yon play greene;
	Count, maid, and there be 9.&#146;
21A.11	&#145;But I hope you are the good old man
	That all the world beleeues vpon.
21A.12	&#145;Old palmer, I pray thee,
	Pennaunce that thou wilt giue to me.&#146;
21A.13	&#145;Penance I can giue thee none,
	But 7 yeere to be a stepping-stone.
21A.14	&#145;Other seaven a clapper in a bell,
	Other 7 to lead an ape in hell.
21A.15	&#145;When thou hast thy penance done,
	Then thoust come a mayden home.&#146;
