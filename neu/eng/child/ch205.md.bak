# 205A: Loudon Hill, or Dromclog


    205A.1   YOURRrrL marvel when I tell ye o
         Our noble Burly and his train,
         When last he marchd up through the land,
         Wi sax-and-twenty westland men.
    205A.2   Than they I neer o braver heard,
         For they had a baith wit and skill;
         They proved right well, as I heard tell,
         As they cam up oer Loudoun Hill.
    205A.3   Weel prosper a the gospel-lads
         That are into the west countrie
         Ay wicked Claverse to demean,
         And ay an ill dead may he die!
    205A.4   For hes drawn up i battle rank,
         An that baith soon an hastilie;
         But they wha live till simmer come,
         Some bludie days for this will see.
    205A.5   But up spak cruel Claverse then,
         Wi hastie wit an wicked skill,
         Gae fire on yon westlan men;
         I think it is my sovreigns will.
    205A.6   But up bespake his cornet then,
         Its be wi nae consent o me;
         I ken Ill neer come back again,
         An mony mae as weel as me.
    205A.7   There is not ane of a yon men
         But wha is worthy other three;
         There is na ane amang them a
         That in his cause will stap to die.
    205A.8   An as for Burly, him I knaw;
         Hes a man of honour, birth, an fame;
         Gie him a sword into his hand,
         Hell fight thysel an other ten.
    205A.9   But up spake wicked Claverse then-+--+-
         I wat his heart it raise fu hie-+--+-
         And he has cryd, that a might hear,
         Man, ye hae sair deceived me.
    205A.10  I never kend the like afore,
         Na, never since I came frae hame,
         That you sae cowardly here suld prove,
         An yet come of a noble Gra+eme.
    205A.11  But up bespake his cornet then,
         Since that it is your honours will,
         Mysel shall be the foremost man
         That shall gie fire on Loudoun Hill.
    205A.12  Your command Ill lead them on,
         But yet wi nae consent o me;
         For weel I ken Ill neer return,
         And mony mae as weel as me.
    205A.13  Then up he drew in battle rank-+--+-
         I wat he had a bonny train-+--+-
         But the first time that bullets flew
         Ay he lost twenty o his men.
    205A.14  Then back he came the way he gaed,
         I wat right soon an suddenly;
         He gave command amang his men,
         And sent them back, and bade them flee.
    205A.15  Then up came Burly, bauld an stout,
         Wi s little train o westland men,
         Wha mair than either aince or twice
         In Edinburgh confind had been.
    205A.16  They hae been up to London sent,
         An yet theyre a come safely down;
         Sax troop o horsemen they hae beat,
         And chased them into Glasgow town.
