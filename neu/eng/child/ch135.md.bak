# 135A: Robin Hood and the Shepherd


    135A.1   ALL gentlemen and yeomen good,
         Down a down a down a down
         I wish you to draw near;
         For a story of gallant brave Robin Hood
         Vnto you I wil declare.
         Down, etc.
    135A.2   As Robin Hood walkt the forrest along,
         Some pastime for to spie,
         There was he aware of a jolly shepherd,
         That on the ground did lie.
    135A.3   Arise, arise, cryed jolly Robin,
         And now come let me see
         What is in thy bag and bottle, I say;
         Come tell it unto me.
    135A.4   Whats that to thee, thou proud fellow?
         Tell me as I do stand
         What thou hast to do with my bag and bottle?
         Let me see thy command.
    135A.5   My sword, which hangeth by my side,
         Is my command I know;
         Come, and let me taste of thy bottle,
         Or it may breed thee wo.
    135A.6   Tut, the devil a drop, thou proud fellow,
         Of my bottle thou shalt see,
         Untill thy valour here be tried,
         Whether thou wilt fight or flee.
    135A.7   What shall we fight for? cries bold Robin Hood;
         Come tell it soon to me;
         Here is twenty pounds in good red gold;
         Win it, and take it thee.
    135A.8   The Shepherd stood all in a maze,
         And knew not what to say:
         I have no money, thou proud fellow,
         But bag and bottle Ile lay.
    135A.9   I am content, thou shepherd-swain,
         Fling them down on the ground;
         But it will breed thee mickle pain,
         To win my twenty pound.
    135A.10  Come draw thy sword, thou proud fellow,
         Thou stands too long to prate;
         This hook of mine shall let thee know
         A coward I do hate.
    135A.11  So they fell to it, full hardy and sore;
         It was in a summers day;
         From ten till four in the afternoon
         The Shepherd held him play.
    135A.12  Robins buckler proved his chief defence,
         And saved him many a bang,
         For every blow the Shepherd gave
         Made Robins sword cry twang.
    135A.13  y a sturdy blow the Shepherd gave,
         And that bold Robin found,
         Till the blood ran trickling from his head;
         Then he fell to the ground.
    135A.14  Arise, arise, thou proud fellow,
         And thou shalt have fair play,
         If thou wilt yield, before thou go,
         That I have won the day.
    135A.15  A boon, a boon, cried bold Robin;
         If that a man thou be,
         Then let me take my beaugle-horn,
         And blow but blasts three.
    135A.16  To blow three times three, the Shepherd said,
         I will not thee deny;
         For if thou shouldest blow till to-morrow morn,
         I scorn one foot to fly.
    135A.17  Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,
         And he blew with mickle main,
         Until he espied Little John
         Come tripping over the plain.
    135A.18  O who is yonder, thou proud fellow,
         That comes down yonder hill?
         Yonder is Little John, bold Robin Hoods man,
         Shall fight with thee thy fill.
    135A.19  What is the matter? saies Little John,
         Master, come tell to me:
         My case is great, saies Robin Hood,
         For the Shepherd hath conquered me.
    135A.20  I am glad of that, cries Little John,
         Shepherd, turn thou to me;
         For a bout with thee I mean to have,
         Either come fight or flee.
    135A.21  With all my heart, thou proud fellow,
         For it never shall be said
         That a shepherds hook of thy sturdy look
         Will one jot be dismaid.
    135A.22  So they fell to it, full hardy and sore,
         Striving for victory;
         I will know, saies John,  re we give ore,
         Whether thou wilt fight or flye.
    135A.23  The Shepherd gave John a sturdy blow,
         With his hook under the chin;
         Beshrew thy heart, said Little John,
         Thou basely dost begin.
    135A.24  Nay, thats nothing, said the Shepherd;
         Either yield to me the day,
         Or I will bang thee back and sides,
         Before thou goest thy way.
    135A.25  What? dost thou think, thou proud fellow,
         That thou canst conquer me?
         Nay, thou shalt know, before thou go,
         Ile fight before Ile flee.
    135A.26  With that to thrash Little John like mad
         The Shepherd he begun;
         Hold, hold, cryed bold Robin Hood,
         And Ile yield the wager won.
    135A.27  With all my heart, said Little John,
         To that I will agree;
         For he is the flower of shepherd-swains,
         The like I never did see.
    135A.28  Thus have you heard of Robin Hood,
         Also of Little John,
         How a shepherd-swain did conquer them;
         The like did never none.
