# 130A: Robin Hood and the Scotchman


    130A.1   THEN bold Robin Hood to the north he would go,
         With a hey down down a down down
         With valour and mickle might,
         With sword by his side, which oft had been trid,
         To fight and recover his right.
    130A.2   The first that he met was a bony bold Scot,
         His servant he said he would be;
         No, quoth Robin Hood, it cannot be good,
         For thou wilt prove false unto me.
    130A.3   Thou hast not bin true to sire nor cuz:
         Nay, marry, the Scot he said,
         As true as your heart, Ile never part,
         Gude master, be not afraid.
         * * * * *
    130A.4   Then Robin Hood turnd his face to the east;
         Fight on my merry men stout,
         Our cause is good, quoth brave Robin Hood,
         And we shall not be beaten out.
    130A.5   The battel grows hot on every side,
         The Scotchman made great moan;
         Quoth Jockey, Gude faith, they fight on each side;
         Would I were with my wife Ione!
    130A.6   The enemy compast brave Robin about,
         Tis long ere the battel ends;
         Thers neither will yeeld nor give up the field,
         For both are supplied with friends.
         * * * * *
    130A.7   This song it was made in Robin Hoods dayes;
         Lets pray unto Iove above
         To give us true peace, that mischief may cease,
         And war may give place unto love.

### 130B: Robin Hood and the Scotchman


    130B.1   NOW bold Robin Hood to the north would go,
         With valour and mickle might,
         With sword by his side, which oft had been tryd,
         To fight and recover his right.
    130B.2   The first that he met was a jolly stout Scot,
         His servant he said he would be;
         No, quoth Robin Hood, it cannot be good,
         For thou wilt prove false unto me.
    130B.3   Thou hast not been true to sire or cuz;
         Nay, marry, the Scot he said,
         As true as your heart, I never will part;
         Good master, be not afraid.
    130B.4   But eer I employ you, said bold Robin Hood,
         With you I must have a bout;
         The Scotchman replyd, Let the battle be tryd,
         For I know I will beat you out.
    130B.5   Thus saying, the contest did quickly begin,
         Which lasted two hours and more;
         The blows Sawney gave bold Robin so brave
         The battle soon made him give oer.
    130B.6   Have mercy, thou Scotchman, bold Robin Hood cryd,
         Full dearly this boon have I bought;
         We will both agree, and my man you shall be,
         For a stouter I never have fought.
    130B.7   Then Sawny consented with Robin to go,
         To be of his bowmen so gay;
         Thus ended the fight, and with mickle delight
         To Sherwood they hasted away.
