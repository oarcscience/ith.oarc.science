# 92A: Bonny Bee Hom


    92A.1   BY Arthurs Dale as late I went
        I heard a heavy moan;
        I heard a ladie lammenting sair,
        And ay she cried Ohone!
    92A.2   Ohon, alas! what shall I do,
        Tormented night and day!
        I never loved a love but ane,
        And now hes gone away.
    92A.3   But I will do for my true-love
        What ladies woud think sair;
        For seven year shall come and go
        Ere a kaim gang in my hair.
    92A.4   There shall neither a shoe gang on my foot,
        Nor a kaim gang in my hair,
        Nor eer a coal nor candle-light
        Shine in my bower nae mair.
    92A.5   She thought her love had been on the sea,
        Fast sailling to Bee Hom;
        But he was in a quiet chamer,
        Hearing his ladies moan.
    92A.6   Be husht, be husht, my ladie dear,
        I pray thee mourn not so;
        For I am deep sworn on a book
        To Bee Hom for to go.
    92A.7   She has gien him a chain of the beaten gowd,
        And a ring with a ruby stone:
        As lang as this chain your body binds,
        Your blude can never be drawn.
    92A.8   But gin this ring shoud fade or fail,
        Or the stone shoud change its hue,
        Be sure your love is dead and gone,
        Or she has proved untrue.
    92A.9   He had no been at Bonny Bee Hom
        A twelve month and a day,
        Till, looking on his gay gowd ring,
        The stone grew dark and gray.
    92A.10  O ye take my riches to Bee Hom,
        And deal them presentlie,
        To the young that canna, the auld that maunna,
        And the blind that does not see.
    92A.11  Now death has come into his bower,
        And split his heart in twain;
        So their twa souls flew up to heaven,
        And there shall ever remain.

### 92B: Bonny Bee Hom


    92B.1   IN Lauderdale I chancd to walk,
        And heard a ladys moan,
        Lamenting for her dearest dear,
        And aye she cried, Ohon!
    92B.2   Sure never a maid that eer drew breath
        Had harder fate than me;
        Id never a lad but one on earth,
        They forcd him to the sea.
    92B.3   The ale shall neer be brewin o malt,
        Neither by sea nor land,
        That ever mair shall cross my hause,
        Till my love comes to hand.
    92B.4   A handsome lad, wi shoulders broad,
        Gold yellow was his hair;
        None of our Scottish youths on earth
        That with him could compare.
    92B.5   She thought her love was gone to sea,
        And landed in Bahome;
        But he was in a quiet chamber,
        Hearing his ladys moan.
    92B.6   Why make ye all this moan, lady?
        Why make ye all this moan?
        For Im deep sworn on a book,
        I must go to Bahome.
    92B.7   Traitors false for to subdue
        Oer seas Ill make me boun,
        That have trepand our kind Scotchmen,
        Like dogs to ding them down.
    92B.8   Weell, take this ring, this royal thing,
        Whose virtue is unknown;
        As langs this rings your body on,
        Your blood shall neer be drawn.
    92B.9   But if this ring shall fade or stain,
        Or change to other hue,
        Come never mair to fair Scotland,
        If yere a lover true.
    92B.10  Then this couple they did part,
        With a sad heavy moan;
        The wind was fair, the ship was rare,
        They landed in Bahome.
    92B.11  But in that place they had not been
        A month but barely one,
        Till he lookd on his gay gold ring,
        And riven was the stone.
    92B.12  Time after this was not expird
        A month but scarcely three,
        Till black and ugly was the ring,
        And the stone was burst in three.
    92B.13  Fight on, fight on, you merry men all,
        With you Ill fight no more;
        I will gang to some holy place,
        Pray to the King of Glore.
    92B.14  Then to the chapel he is gone,
        And knelt most piteouslie,
        For seven days and seven nights,
        Till blood ran frae his knee.
    92B.15  Yell take my jewels thats in Bahome,
        And deal them liberallie,
        To young that cannot, and old that mannot,
        The blind that does not see.
    92B.16  Give maist to women in child-bed laid,
        Can neither fecht nor flee;
        I hope shes in the heavens high,
        That died for love of me.
    92B.17  The knights they wrang their white fingers,
        The ladies tore their hair;
        The women that neer had children born,
        In swoon they down fell there.
    92B.18  But in what way the knight expird,
        No tongue will eer declare;
        So this doth end my mournful song,
        From me yell get nae mair.
