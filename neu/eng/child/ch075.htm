<PRE>

75A.1	&#145;AND I fare you well, Lady Ouncebell,
	For I must needs be gone,
	And this time two year I&#146;ll meet you again,
	To finish the loves we begun.&#146;
75A.2	&#145;That is a long time, Lord Lovill,&#146; said she,
	&#145;To live in fair Scotland;&#146;
	&#145;And so it is, Lady Ouncebell,
	To leave a fair lady alone.&#146;
75A.3	He had not been in fair Scotland
	Not half above half a year,
	But a longin mind came into his head,
	Lady Ouncebell he woud go see her.
75A.4	He called up his stable-groom,
	To sadle his milk-white stead;
      Refrain:	Dey down, dey down, dey down dery down,
75A.4	I wish Lord Lovill good speed.
75A.5	He had not been in fair London
	Not half above half a day,
	But he heard the bells of the high chapel ring,
	They rang with a ceserera.
75A.6	He asked of a gentleman,
	That set there all alone,
	What made the bells of the high chapel ring,
	The ladys make all their moan.
75A.7	&#145;One of the king&#146;s daughters are dead,&#146; said he,
	&#145;Lady Ouncebell was her name;
	She died for love of a courtous young night,
	Lord Lovill he was the same.&#146;
75A.8	He caused her corps to be set down,
	And her winding sheet undone,
	And he made a vow before them all
	He&#146;d never kiss wowman again.
75A.9	Lady Ouncebell died on the yesterday,
	Lord Lovill on the morrow;
	Lady Ouncebell died for pure true love,
	Lord Lovill died for sorrow.
75A.10	Lady Ouncebell was buried in the high chancel,
	Lord Lovill in the choir;
	Lady Ouncebell&#146;s breast sprung out a sweet rose,
	Lord Lovill&#146;s a bunch of sweet brier.
75A.11	They grew till they grew to the top of the church,
	And then they could grow no higher;
	They grew till they grew to a true-lover&#146;s not,
	And then they tyed both together.
75A.12	An old wowman coming by that way,
	And a blessing she did crave,
	To cut of a bunch of that true-lover&#146;s not,
	And buried them both in one grave.

75B.11	Lord Lavel was buried in Mary&#146;s kirk,
	Nancybelle in Mary&#146;s quire;
	And out o the ane there grew a birk,
	Out the other a bonny brier.

	Until they twa did meet,
	That ilka ane might plainly see
	They war twa lovers sweet.

75E.1	&#145;NOW fare ye well, Lady Oonzabel,
	For I must needs be gone,
	To visit the king of fair Scotland,
	Oh I must be up and ride.&#146;
75E.2	So he called unto him his little foot-page,
	To saddle his milk-white steed;
      Refrain:	Hey down, hey down, hey derry, hey down,
75E.2	How I wish my Lord Lovel good speed!
75E.3	He had not been in fair Scotland,
	Not passing half a year,
	When a lover-like thought came into his head,
	Lady Oonzabel he would go see her.
75E.4	So he called unto him his little foot-page,
	To saddle his milk-white steed;
      Refrain:	Hey down, hey down, hey derry, hey down,
75E.4	How I wish my Lord Lovel good speed.
75E.5	He had not been in fair England,
	Not passing half a day,
	When the bells of the high chappel did ring,
	And they made a loud sassaray.
75E.6	He asked of an old gentleman
	Who was sitting there all alone,
	Why the bells of the high chappel did ring,
	And the ladies were making a moan.
75E.7	&#145;Oh, the king&#146;s fair daughter is dead,&#146; said he;
	&#145;Her name&#146;s Lady Oonzabel;
	And she died for the love of a courteous young knight,
	And his name it is Lord Lovel.&#146;
	* * * * *
75E.8	He caused the bier to be set down,
	The winding sheet undone,
	And drawing forth his rapier bright,
	Through his own true heart did it run.
75E.9	Lady Oonzabel lies in the high chappel,
	Lord Lovel he lies in the quier;
	And out of the one there grew up a white rose,
	And out of the other a brier.
75E.10	And they grew, and they grew, to the high chappel top;
	They could not well grow any higher;
	And they twined into a true lover&#146;s knot,
	So in death they are joined together.

	Mounting his milk-white steed,
	Who came by but poor Nancy Bell,
	And she wished Lovel good speed.

75H.1	LORD LOVEL he stood at his castle-gate,
	Combing his milk-white steed,
	When up came Lady Nancy Belle,
	To wish her lover good speed, speed,
	To wish her lover good speed.
75H.2	&#145;Where are you going, Lord Lovel?&#146; she said,
	&#145;Oh where are you going?&#146; said she;
	&#145;I&#146;m going, my Lady Nancy Belle,
	Strange countries for to see.&#146;
75H.3	&#145;When will you be back, Lord Lovel?&#146; she said,
	&#145;Oh when will you come back?&#146; said she;
	&#145;In a year or two, or three, at the most,
	I&#146;ll return to my fair Nancy.&#146;
75H.4	But he had not been gone a year and a day,
	Strange countries for to see,
	When languishing thoughts came into his head,
	Lady Nancy Belle he would go see.
75H.5	So he rode, and he rode, on his milk-white steed,
	Till he came to London town,
	And there he heard St Pancras bells,
	And the people all mourning round.
75H.6	&#145;Oh what is the matter?&#146; Lord Lovel he said,
	&#145;Oh what is the matter?&#146; said he;
	&#145;A lord&#146;s lady is dead,&#146; a woman replied,
	&#145;And some call her Lady Nancy.&#146;
75H.7	So he ordered the grave to be opened wide,
	And the shroud he turned down,
	And there he kissed her clay-cold lips,
	Till the tears came trickling down.
75H.8	Lady Nancy she died, as it might be, today,
	Lord Lovel he died as tomorrow;
	Lady Nancy she died out of pure, pure grief,
	Lord Lovel he died out of sorrow.
75H.9	Lady Nancy was laid in St. Pancras church,
	Lord Lovel was laid in the choir;
	And out of her bosom there grew a red rose,
	And out of her lover&#146;s a briar.
75H.10	They grew, and they grew, to the church-steeple too,
	And then they could grow no higher;
	So there they entwined in a true-lover&#146;s knot,
	For all lovers true to admire.

75I.7	When he came to merry Primrose,

	But there&#146;s nae life in within.
75I.15	&#145;Gar deal, gar deal the bread,&#146; he says,

75I.16	The tane was buried in Mary&#146;s kirk,
	The tother in Mary&#146;s choir,
	And out of the tane there sprang a birch,
	And out of the tother a briar.
