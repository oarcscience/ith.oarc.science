78A.1	&#145;THE wind doth blow today, my love,
	And a few small drops of rain;
	I never had but one true-love,
	In cold grave she was lain.
78A.2	&#145;I&#146;ll do as much for my true-love
	As any young man may;
	I&#146;ll sit and mourn all at her grave
	For a twelvemonth and a day.&#146;
78A.3	The twelvemonth and a day being up,
	The dead began to speak:
	&#145;Oh who sits weeping on my grave,
	And will not let me sleep?&#146;
78A.4	&#145;&#146;Tis I, my love, sits on your grave,
	And will not let you sleep;
	For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips,
	And that is all I seek.&#146;
78A.5	&#145;You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips;
	But my breath smells earthy strong;
	If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips,
	Your time will not be long.
78A.6	&#145;&#146;Tis down in yonder garden green,
	Love, where we used to walk,
	The finest flower that ere was seen
	Is withered to a stalk.
78A.7	&#145;The stalk is withered dry, my love,
	So will our hearts decay;
	So make yourself content, my love,
	Till God calls you away.&#146;

78B.1	&#145;HOW cold the wind do blow, dear love,
	And see the drops of rain!
	I never had but one true-love,
	In the green wood he was slain.
78B.2	&#145;I would do as much for my own true-love
	As in my power doth lay;
	I would sit and mourn all on his grave
	For a twelvemonth and a day.&#146;
78B.3	A twelvemonth and a day being past,
	His ghost did rise and speak:
	&#145;What makes you mourn all on my grave?
	For you will not let me sleep.&#146;
78B.4	&#145;It is not your gold I want, dear love,
	Nor yet your wealth I crave;
	But one kiss from your lily-white lips
	Is all I wish to have.
78B.5	&#145;Your lips are cold as clay, dear love,
	Your breath doth smell so strong;&#146;
	&#145;I am afraid, my pretty, pretty maid,
	Your time will not be long.&#146;

78C.1	&#145;COLD blows the wind oer my true-love,
	Cold blow the drops of rain;
	I never, never had but one sweetheart,
	In the greenwood he was slain.
78C.2	&#145;I did as much for my true-love
	As ever did any maid;
	. . . . .
	. . . . .

78C.3	&#145;One kiss from your lily-cold lips, true-love,
	One kiss is all I pray,
	And I&#146;ll sit and weep all over your grave
	For a twelvemonth and a day.&#146;
78C.4	&#145;My cheek is as cold as the clay, true-love,
	My breath is earthy and strong;
	And if I should kiss your lips, true-love,
	Your life would not be long.&#146;

78D.1	&#145;PROUD BOREAS makes a hideous noise,
	Loud roars the fatal fleed;
	I loved never a love but one,
	In church-yard she lies dead.
78D.2	&#145;But I will do for my love&#146;s sake
	What other young men may;
	I&#146;ll sit and mourn upon her grave,
	A twelvemonth and a day.&#146;
78D.3	A twelvemonth and a day being past,
	The ghost began to speak:
	&#145;Why sit ye here upon my grave,
	And will not let me sleep?&#146;
78D.4	&#145;One kiss of your lily-white lips
	Is all that I do crave;
	And one kiss of your lily-white lips
	Is all that I would have.&#146;
78D.5	&#145;Your breath is as the roses sweet,
	Mine as the sulphur strong;
	If you get one kiss of my lips,
	Your days would not be long.
78D.6	&#145;Mind not ye the day, Willie,
	Sin you and I did walk?
	The firstand flower that we did pu
	Was witherd on the stalk.&#146;
78D.7	&#145;Flowers will fade and die, my dear,
	Aye as the tears will turn;
	And since I&#146;ve lost my own sweet-heart,
	I&#146;ll never cease but mourn.&#146;
78D.8	&#145;Lament nae mair for me, my love,
	The powers we must obey;
	But hoist up one sail to the wind,
	Your ship must sail away.&#146;

78[E].1	&#145;Cold blows the wind over my true love,
	Cold blows the drops of rain;
	I never, never had but one sweet-heart,
	In the green wood he was slain.
78[E.2]	&#145;But I&#146;ll do as much for my true love
	As any young girl can do;
	I&#146;ll sit and I&#146;ll weep by his grave-side
	For a twelvemonth and one day.&#146;
78[E.3]	When the twelvemonth&#146;s end and one day was past,
	This young man he arose:
	&#145;What makes you weep by my grave-side
	For twelve months and one day?&#146;
78[E.4]	&#145;Only one kiss from your lily cold lips,
	One kiss is all I crave;
	Only one kiss from your lily cold lips,
	And return back to your grave.&#146;
78[E.5]	&#145;My lip is cold as the clay, sweet-heart,
	My breath is earthly strong;
	If you should have a kiss from my cold lip,
	Your days will not be long.&#146;
78[E.6]	&#145;Go fetch me a note from the dungeon dark,
	Cold water from a stone;
	There I&#146;ll sit and weep for my true love
	For a twelvemonth and one day.
78[E.7]	&#145;Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep;
	I will lay down in it and take one sleep,
	For a twelvemonth and one day;
	I will lay down in it and take a long sleep,
	For a twelvemonth and a day.&#146;

78[F].1	&#145;Cold blows the wind over my true love,
	Cold blow the drops of rain;
	I never, never had but one true love,
	And in Camvile he was slain.
78[F.2]	&#145;I&#146;ll do as much for my true love
	As any young girl may;
	I&#146;ll sit and weep down by his grave
	For twelve months and one day.&#146;
78[F.3]	But when twelve months were come and gone,
	This young man he arose:
	&#145;What makes you weep down by my grave?
	I can&#146;t take my respose.&#146;
78[F.4]	&#145;One kiss, one kiss, of your lily-white lips,
	One kiss is all I crave;
	One kiss, one kiss, of your lily-white lips,
	And return back to your grave.&#146;
78[F.5]	&#145;My lips they are as cold as my clay,
	My breath is heavy and strong;
	If thou wast to kiss my lily-white lips,
	Thy days would not be long.
78[F.6]	&#145;O don&#146;t you remember the garden-grove
	Where we was used to walk?
	Pluck the finest flower of them all,
	&#146;Twill wither to a stalk.&#146;
78[F.7]	&#145;Go fetch me a nut from a dungeon deep,
	And water from a stone,
	And white milk from a maiden&#146;s breast
	[That babe bare never none].&#146;

78[G].1	&#145;Cold blows the wind to-day, sweetheart,
	Cold are the drops of rain;
	The first truelove that ever I had
	In the green wood he was slain.
78[G.2]	&#145;&#146;Twas down on the garden-green, sweetheart,
	Where you and I did walk;
	The fairest flower that in the garden grew
	Is witherd to a stalk.
78[G.3]	&#145;The stalk will bear no leaves, sweetheart,
	The flowers will neer return,
	And since my truelove is dead and gone,
	What can I do but mourn?&#146;
78[G.4]	A twelvemonth and a day being gone,
	The spirit rose and spoke:
	. . . . . . .
	. . . . . . .
78[G.5]	&#145;My body is clay-cold, sweetheart,
	My breath smells heavy and strong,
	And if you kiss my lily-white lips
	Your time will not be long.&#146;

78[Ha].1	&#145;Cold blows the wind tonight, sweet-heart,
	Cold are the drops of rain;
	The very first love that ever I had
	In greenwood he was slain.
78[Ha.2]	&#145;I&#146;ll do as much for my sweet-heart
	As any young woman may;
	I&#146;ll sit and mourn on his grave-side
	A twelve-month and a day.&#146;
78[Ha.3]	A twelve-month and a day being up,
	The ghost began to speak:
	&#145;Why sit you here by my grave-side
	And will not let me sleep?
78[Ha.4]	&#145;What is it that you want of me,
	Or what of me would have?&#146;
	&#145;A kiss from off your lily-white lips,
	And that is all I crave!&#146;
78[Ha.5]	&#145;Cold are my lips in death, sweet-heart,
	My breath is earthy strong;
	To gain a kiss of my cold lips,
	Your time would not be long.
78[Ha.6]	&#145;If you were not my own sweet-heart,
	As now I know you be,
	I&#146;d tear you as the withered leaves
	That grew on yonder tree.&#146;
78[Ha.7]	&#145;O don&#146;t you mind the garden, love,
	Where you and I did walk?
	The fairest flower that blossomd there
	Is withered on the stalk.
	* * * * * * *
78[Ha.8]	&#145;And now I&#146;ve mourned upon his grave
	A twelvemonth and a day,
	We&#146;ll set our sails before the wind
	And so we&#146;ll sail away.&#146;

78[Hb].1	Cold blows the wind to-night, my love,
	Cold are the drops of rain;
	The very first love that ever I had
	In greenwood he was slain.
78[Hb.2]	&#145;I&#146;ll do as much for my true-love
	As any young woman may;
	I&#146;ll sit and mourn upon his grave
	A twelve-month and a day.&#146;
78[Hb.3]	When a twelve-month and a day were up,
	His body straight arose:
	&#145;What brings you weeping oer my grave
	That I get no respose?&#146;
78[Hb.4]	&#145;O think upon the garden, love,
	Where you and I did walk;
	The fairest flower that blossomd there
	Is withered on the stalk.
78[Hb.5]	&#145;The stalk will bear no leaves, sweet-heart,
	The flower will neer return,
	And my true-love is dead, is dead,
	And i do naught but mourn.&#146;
78[Hb.6]	&#145;What is it that you want of me
	And will not let me sleep?
	Your salten tears they trickle down
	And wet my winding-sheet.&#146;
78[Hb.7]	&#145;What is it that I want of thee,
	O what of thee in grave?
	A kiss from off your lily-white lips,
	And that is all I crave.&#146;
78[Hb.8]	&#145;Cold are my lips in death, sweet-heart,
	My breath is earthy strong;
	If you do touch my clay-cold lips,
	Your time will not be long.&#146;
78[Hb.9]	&#145;Cold though your lips in death, sweet-heart,
	One kiss is all I crave;
	I care not, if I kiss but thee,
	That I should share thy grave.&#146;
78[Hb.10]	&#145;Go fetch me a light from dungeon deep,
	Wring water from a stone,
	And likewise milk from a maiden&#146;s breast
	That never maid hath none.  (read babe had.)
	* * * * * * *
78[Hb.11]	&#145;Now if you were not true in word,
	As now I know you be,
	I&#146;d tear you as the withered leaves
	Are torn from off the tree.&#146;
