    297A.1   O EARL Rothes, an thou wert mine,
         And I were to be thy ladie,
         I wad drink at the beer, and tipple at the wine,
         And be my bottle with any.
    297A.2   Hold thy tongue, sister Ann, he says,
         Thy words they are too many;
         What wad ye do wi sae noble a lord,
         When he has so noble a ladie?
    297A.3   O Ill pay you your tocher, Lady Ann,
         Both in gear and money,
         If yell forsake Earl Rothess companie,
         And mind that he has a ladie.
    297A.4   I do not value your gold, she says,
         Your gear its no sae readie;
         Ill neer forsake Earl Rothess companie,
         And I dont gie a fig for his ladie.
    297A.5   Ill keep ye i the caslte, Lady Ann,
         O servants ye shall hae monie;
         Ill keep ye till yere safely brocht to bed,
         And Ill mak you a marquiss ladie.
    297A.6   I do not value your castle, she says,
         Your servants are no sae readie;
         Earl Rothes will keep me till Im brocht to bed,
         And hell mak me a marquiss ladie.
    297A.7   Woe be to thee, Earl Rothes, he says,
         And the mark o the judge be upon thee,
         For the using o this poor thing sae,
         For the using my sister so badly.
    297A.8   When Im come to the years of a man,
         And able a sword to carry,
         Ill thrust it thro Earl Rothes bodie
         For the using my sister sae basely.
    297A.9   Fare thee well, Lady Ann, he says,
         No longer will I tarry;
         You and I will never meet again,
         Till we meet at the bonny town o Torry.
