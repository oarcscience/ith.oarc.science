# 212A: The Duke of Athole’s Nurse


    212A.*   * * *
         WHERE shall I gang, my ain true love?
         Where shall I gang to hide me?
         For weel ye ken i yere fathers bowr
         It wad be death to find me.
    212A.2   O go you to yon tavern-house,
         An there count owre your lawin,
         An, if I be a woman true,
         Ill meet you in the dawin.
    212A.3   O hes gone to yon tavern-house,
         An ay he counted his lawin,
         An ay he drank to her guid health
         Was to meet him in the dawin.
    212A.4   O hes gone to yon tavern-house,
         An counted owre his lawin,
         When in there cam three armed men,
         To meet him in the dawin.
    212A.5   O woe be unto womans wit!
         It has beguiled many;
         She promised to come hersel,
         But she sent three men to slay me.

### 212B: The Duke of Athole’s Nurse


    212B.1   YE are the Duke of Athols nurse,
         And Im the new-come darling;
         Ill gie you my gay gold rings
         To get ae word of my leman.
    212B.2   I am the Duke Athols nurse,
         And yere the new-come darling;
         Keep well your gay gold rings,
         Ye sall get twa words o your leman.
    212B.3   He leand oure his saddle-bow,
         It was not for to kiss her:
         Anither woman has my heart,
         And I but come here to see ye.
    212B.4   If anither woman has your heart,
         O dear, but I am sorry!
         Ye hie you down to yon ale house,
         And stay untill t be dawing,
         And if I be a woman true
         Ill meet you in the dawing.
    212B.5   He did him down to yon ale-house,
         And drank untill t was dawing;
         He drank the bonnie lassies health
         That was to clear his lawing.
    212B.6   He lookit out of a shot-window,
         To see if she was coming,
         And there he seed her seven brithers,
         So fast as they were running!
    212B.7   He went up and down the house,
         Says, Landlady, can you save me?
         For yonder comes her seven brithers,
         And they are coming to slay me.
    212B.8   So quick she minded her on a wile
         How she might protect him!
         She dressd him in a suit of womans attire
         And set him to her baking.
    212B.9   Had you a quarterer here last night,
         Or staid he to the dawing?
         Shew us the room the squire lay in,
         We are come to clear his lawing.
    212B.10  I had a quarterer here last night,
         But he staid not to the dawing;
         He called for a pint, and paid as he went,
         You have nothing to do with his lawing.
    212B.11  They searchd the house baith up and down,
         The curtains they spaird not to rive em,
         And twenty times they passd
         The squire at his baking.

### 212C: The Duke of Athole’s Nurse


    212C.1   AS I went down by the Duke of Atholes gates,
         Where the bells of the court were ringing,
         And there I heard a fair maid say,
         O if I had but ae sight o my Johnie!
    212C.2   O here is your Johnie just by your side;
         What have ye to say to your Johnie?
         O here is my hand, but anither has my heart,
         So yell never get more o your Johnie.
    212C.3   O ye may go down to yon ale-house,
         And there do sit till the dawing;
         And call for the wine that is very, very fine,
         And Ill come and clear up your lawing.
    212C.4   So hes gane down to yon ale-house,
         And he has sat till the dawing;
         And hes calld for the wine thats very, very fine,
         But she neer cam to clear up his lawing.
    212C.5   Lang or the dawing he oure the window looks,
         To see if his true-love was coming,
         And there he spied twelve weel armd boys,
         Coming over the plainstanes running.
    212C.6   O landlady, landlady, what shall I do?
         For my life its not worth a farthing!
         O young man, said she, Tak counsel by me,
         And I will be your undertaking.
    212C.7   I will clothe you in my own body-clothes
         And Ill send you like a girl to the baking:
         And loudly, loudly they rapped at the door,
         And loudly, loudly they rapp d.
    212C.8   O had you any strangers here late last night?
         Or were they lang gane or the dawing?
         O had you any strangers here late last night?
         We are now come to clear up his lawing.
    212C.9   O I had a stranger here late last night,
         But he was lang gane or the dawing;
         He called for a pint, and he paid it as he went,
         And yeve no more to do with his lawing.
    212C.10  O show me the room that your stranger lay in,
         If he was lang gane or the dawing:
         She showed them the room that her stranger lay in,
         But he was lang gane or the dawing.
    212C.11  O they stabbed the feather-bed all round and round,
         And the curtains they neer stood to tear them;
         And they gade as they cam, and left a things undone,
         And left the young squire by his baking.

### 212D: The Duke of Athole’s Nurse


    212D.1   AS I cam in by the Duke of Atholes gate,
         I heard a fair maid singing,
         Wi a bonny baby on her knee,
         And the bells o the court were ringing.
    212D.2   O its I am the Duke of Atholes nurse,
         And the place does well become me;
         But I would gie a my half-years fee
         Just for a sight o my Johnie.
         * * * * *
    212D.3   If yell gae down to yon ale-house,
         And stop till it be dawing,
         And ca for a pint o the very, very best,
         And Ill come and clear up your lawing.
    212D.4   O hes gane down to yon ale-house,
         And stopt till it was dawing;
         He cad for a pint o the very, very best,
         But she cam na to clear up his lawing.
    212D.5   He looked out at the chamber-window,
         To see if she was coming;
         And there he spied ten armed men,
         Across the plain coming running.
    212D.6   O landlady, landlady, what shall I do?
         For my life is not worth a farthing;
         I paid you a guinea for my lodging last night,
         But I fear Ill never see sun shining.
    212D.7   If ye will be advised by me,
         Ill be your undertaking;
         Ill dress you up in my ain body-clothes
         And set you to the baking.
    212D.8   So loudly at the door they rapt,
         So loudly are they calling,
         O had you a stranger here last night,
         Or is he within your dwelling?
    212D.9   O I had a stranger here last night,
         But he wos gane or dawing;
         He cad for a pint, and he paid it or he went,
         And I hae nae mair to do wi his lawing.
    212D.10  They stabd the feather-beds round and round,
         The curtains they spared na to tear them;
         But they went as they came, and left a things undone,
         And the young man busy baking.

### 212E: The Duke of Athole’s Nurse


    212E.1   I AM the Duke o Atholes nurse,
         My part does well become me,
         And I wad gie aw my half-years fee
         For ae sicht o my Johnie.
    212E.2   Keep weill, keep weill your half-years fee,
         For yell soon get a sicht o your Johnie;
         But anither woman has my heart,
         And Im sorry for to leave ye.
    212E.3   RRrryell dow ye doun to yon changehouse,
         And yell drink till the day be dawin;
         At ilka pints end yell drink my health out,
         And Ill come and pay for the lawin.
    212E.4   Ay he ranted and he sang,
         And drank till the day was dawin,
         And ay he drank the bonnie lassys health
         That was coming to pay the lawin.
    212E.5   He spared na the sack, tho it was dear,
         The wine nor the sugar-candy,
         . . . .
         . . . .
    212E.6   Hes dune him to the shot-window,
         To see an she was coming,
         And there he spied twelve armed men,
         That oure the plain cam rinning.
    212E.7   Hes dune him doun to the landlady,
         To see gin she wad protect him;
         Shes buskit him up into womens claiths
         And set him till a baking.
    212E.8   Sae loudly as they rappit at the yett,
         Sae loudly as they callit,
         Had ye onie strangers here last nicht,
         That drank till the day was dawin?
         * * * * *

### 212F: The Duke of Athole’s Nurse


    212F.1   AS I gaed in yon greenwood-side,
         I heard a fair maid singing;
         Her voice was sweet, she sang sae complete
         That all the woods were ringing.
    212F.2   O Im the duke o Atholes nurse,
         My post is well becoming;
         But I woud gie a my half-years fee
         For ae sight o my leman.
    212F.3   Ye say, yere the Duke o Atholes nurse,
         Your post is well becoming;
         Keep well, keep well your half-years fee,
         Yese hae twa sights o your leman.
    212F.4   He leand him ower his saddle-bow
         And cannilie kissd his dearie:
         Ohon and alake! anither has my heart,
         And I darena mair come near thee.
    212F.5   Ohon and alake! if anither hae your heart,
         These words hae fairly undone me;
         But let us set a time, tryst to meet again,
         Then in gude friends you will twine me.
    212F.6   Ye will do you down to yon tavern-house
         And drink till the day be dawing,
         And, as sure as I ance had a love for you,
         Ill come there and clear your lawing.
    212F.7   Yell spare not the wine, altho it be fine,
         Nae Malago, tho it be rarely,
         But yell aye drink the bonnie lassies health
         Thats to clear your lawing fairly.
    212F.8   Then hes done him down to yon tavern-house
         And drank till day was dawing,
         And aye he drank the bonnie lassies health
         That was coming to clear his lawing.
    212F.9   And aye as he birled, and aye as he drank,
         The gude beer and the brandy,
         He spard not the wine, altho it was fine,
         The sack nor the sugar candy.
    212F.10  Its a wonder to me, the knight he did say,
         My bonnie lassies sae delaying;
         She promised, as sure as she loved me ance,
         She woud be here by the dawing.
    212F.11  Hes done him to a shott-window,
         A little before the dawing,
         And there he spied her nine brothers bauld,
         Were coming to betray him.
    212F.12  Where shall I rin? where shall I gang?
         Or where shall I gang hide me?
         She that was to meet me in friendship this day
         Has sent nine men to slay me!
    212F.13  Hes gane to the landlady o the house,
         Says, O can you supply me?
         For she that was to meet me in friendship this day
         Has sent nine men to slay me.
    212F.14  She gae him a suit o her ain female claise
         And set him to the baking;
         The bird never sang mair sweet on the bush
         Nor the knight sung at the baking.
    212F.15  As they came in at the ha-door,
         Sae loudly as they rappit!
         And when they came upon the floor,
         Sae loudly as they chappit!
    212F.16  O had ye a stranger here last night,
         Who drank till the day was dawing?
         Come show us the chamber where he lyes in,
         Well shortly clear his lawing.
    212F.17  I had nae stranger here last night
         That drank till the day was dawing;
         But ane that took a pint, and paid it ere he went,
         And theres naething to clear o his lawing.
    212F.18  A lad among the rest, being o a merry mood,
         To the young knight fell a-talking;
         The wife took her foot and gae him a kick,
         Says, Be busy, ye jilt, at your baking.
    212F.19  They stabbed the house baith but and ben,
         The curtains they spared nae riving,
         And for a that they search and ca,
         For a kiss o the knight they were striving.
