# 207A: Lord Delamere


    207A.1   GOOD people, give attention, a story you shall hear,
         It is of the king and my lord Delamere;
         The quarrel it arose in the Parliament House,
         Concdrning some taxations going to be put in force.
         Ri toora loora la.
    207A.2   Says my lord Delamere to his Majesty soon,
         If it please you, my liege, of you Ill soon beg a boon.
         Then what is your boon? let me it understand:
         Its to have all the poor men you have in your land.
    207A.3   And Ill take them to Cheshire, and there I will sow
         Both hempseed and flaxseed, and [hang] them all in a row.
         Why, theyd better be hanged, and stopped soon their breath,
         If it please you, my liege, than to starve them to death.
    207A.4   Then up starts a French lord, as we do hear,
         Saying, Thou art a proud Jack, to my lord Delamere;
         Thou oughtest to be stabbed-+--+-then he turnd him about-+--+-
         For affronting the king in the Parliament House.
    207A.5   Then up starts his grace, the Duke of Devonshire,
         Saying, Ill fight in defence of my lord Delamere.
         Then a stage was erected, to battle they went,
         To kill or to be killed was our noble dukes intent.
    207A.6   The very first push, as we do understand,
         The dukes sword he bended it back into his hand.
         He waited a while, but nothing he spoke,
         Till on the kings armour his rapier he broke.
    207A.7   An English lord, who by that stage did stand,
         Threw Devonshire another, and he got it in his hand:
         Play low for your life, brave Devonshire, said he,
         Play low for your life, or a dead man you will be.
    207A.8   Devonshire dropped on his knee, and gave him his death-wound;
         O then that French lord fell dead upon the ground.
         The king called his guards, and he unto them did say,
         Bring Devonshire down, and take the dead man away.
    207A.9   No, if it please you, my liege, no! Ive slain him like a man;
         Im resolved to see what clothing hes got on.
         Oh, fie upon your treachery, your treachery! said he,
         Oh, king, twas your intention to have took my life away.
    207A.10  For he fought in your armour, whilst I have fought in bare;
         The same thou shalt win, king, before thou does it wear.
         Then they all turned back to the Parliament House,
         And the nobles made obesiance with their hands to their mouths.
    207A.11  God bless all the nobles we have in our land,
         And send the Church of England may flourish still and stand;
         For Ive injured no king, no kingdom, nor no crown,
         But I wish that every honest man might enjoy his own.

### 207B: Lord Delamere


    207B.1   GOOD people give attention to a story you shall hear:
         Between the king and my lord Delamere,
         A quarrel arose in the Parliament House,
         Concerning the taxes to be put in force.
         With my fal de ral de ra.
    207B.2   I wonder, I wonder that James, our good king,
         So many hard taxes upon the poor should bring;
         So many hard taxes, as I have heard them say,
         Makes many a good farmer to break and run away.
    207B.3   Such a rout has been in the parliament, as I hear,
         Betwixt a Dutch lord and my lord Delamere.
         He said to the king, as he sat on the throne,
         If it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon.
    207B.4   O what is thy boon? Come. let me understand.
         Tis to give me all the poor you have in the land;
         Ill take them down to Cheshire, and there I will sow
         Both hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them in a row.
    207B.5   Its better, my liege, they should die a shorter death
         Than for your Majesty to starve them on earth.
         With that up starts a Dutch lord, as we hear,
         And he says, Thou proud Jack, to my lord Delamere,
    207B.6   Thou ought to be stabbed, and he turned him about,
         For affronting the king in the Parliament House.
         Then up got a brave duke, the Duke of Devonshire,
         Who said, I will fight for my lord Delamere.
    207B.7   He is under age, as Ill make it appear,
         So Ill stand in defence of my lord Delamere.
         A stage then was built, and to battle they went,
         To kill or be killed it was their intent.
    207B.8   The very first blow, as we understand,
         Devonshires rapier went back to his hand;
         Then he mused awhile, but not a word spoke,
         When against the kings armour his rapier he broke.
    207B.9   O then he stept backward, and backward stept he,
         And then stept forward my lord Willoughby;
         He gave him a rapier, and thus he did say;
         Play low, Devonshire, theres treachery, I see.
    207B.10  He knelt on his knee, and he gave him the wound,
         With that the Dutch lord fell dead on the ground:
         The king calld his soldiers, and thus he did say:
         Call Devonshire down, take the dead man away.
    207B.11  He answered, My liege, Ive killed him like a man,
         And it is my intent to see what clothing hes got on.
         O treachery! O treachery! as I well may say,
         It was your intent, O king, to take my life away.
    207B.12  He fought in your armour, while I fought him bare,
         And thou, king, shalt win it before thou dost it wear;
         I neither do curse king, parliament, or throne,
         But I wish every honest man may enjoy his own.
    207B.13  The rich men do flourish with silver and gold,
         While poor men are starving with hunger and cold;
         And if they hold on as they have begun,
         Theyll make little England pay dear for a king.

### 207C: Lord Delamere


    207C.1   O THE Duchess of Devonshire was standing hard by;
         Upon her dear husband she cast her lovely eye:
         Oh, fie upon treachery! theres been treachery I say,
         It was your full intent to have taen my dukes life away.
    207C.2   Then away to the parliament these votes all went again,
         And there they acted like just and honest men.
         I neither curse my king, nor kingdom, crown or throne,
         But I wish every honest man to enjoy but what is his own.

### 207D: Lord Delamere


    207D.1   IN the Parliament House a great rout has been there,
         Betwixt our good king and the lord Delaware:
         Says Lord Delaware to his Majesty full soon,
         Will it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon?
    207D.2   Whats your boon? says the king, Now let me understand.
         Its, give me all the poor men weve starving in this land,
         And without delay Ill hie me to Lincolnshire,
         To sow hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them all there.
    207D.3   For with hempen cord its better to stop each poor mans breath
         Than with famine you should see your subjects starve to death.
         Up starts a Dutch lord, who to Delaware did say,
         Thou deservest to be stabbd! then he turnd himself away.
    207D.4   Thou deservest to be stabbd, and the dogs have thine ears,
         For insulting our king, in this parliament of peers.
         Up sprang a Welsh lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire:
         In young Delawares defence, Ill fight this Dutch lord, my sire.
    207D.5   For he is in the right, and Ill make it so appear;
         Him I dare to single combat, for insulting Delaware.
         A stage was soon erected, and to combat they went;
         For to kill or to be killd, it was eithers full intent.
    207D.6   But the very first flourish, when the heralds gave command,
         The sword of brave Devonshire bent backward on his hand.
         In suspense he paused a while, scannd his foe before he strake,
         Then against the kings armour his bent sword he brake.
    207D.7   Then he sprang from the stage to a soldier in the ring,
         Saying, Lend your sword, that to an end this tragedy we bring.
         Though hes fighting me in armour, while I am fighting bare,
         Even more than this Id venture for young Lord Delaware.
    207D.8   Leaping back on the stage, sword to buckler now resounds,
         Till he left the Dutch lord a bleeding in his wounds.
         This seeing, cries the king to his guards without delay,
         Call Devonshire down! take the dead man away!
    207D.9   No, says brave Devonshire, Ive fought him as a man;
         Since hes dead, I will keep the trophies I have won.
         For he fought me in your armour, while I fought him bare,
         And the same you must win back, my liege, if ever you them wear.
    207D.10  God bless the Church of England! may it prosper on each hand,
         And also every poor man now starving in this land.
         And while I pray success may crown our king upon his throne,
         Ill wish every poor man may long enjoy his own.
