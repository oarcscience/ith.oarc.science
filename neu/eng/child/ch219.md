# 219A: The Gardener


    219A.1   THE gardener stands in his bower-door,
         With a primrose in his hand,
         And by there came a leal maiden,
         As jimps a willow wand.
         And by, etc.
    219A.2   O lady, can you fancy me,
         For to be my bride,
         Youll get a the flowers in my garden,
         To be to you a weed.
    219A.3   The lily white shall be your smock;
         Becomes your body neat;
         And your head shall be deckd with jelly-flower,
         And the primrose in your breast.
    219A.4   Your gown shall be o the sweet-william,
         Your coat o camovine,
         And your apron o the salads neat,
         That taste baith sweet and fine.
    219A.5   Your stockings shall be o the broad kail-blade,
         That is baith broad and long;
         And narrow, narrow at the coot,
         And broad, broad at the brawn.
    219A.6   Your gloves shall be the marygold,
         All glittering to your hand,
         Well spread oer wi the blue blaewort,
         That grows in corn-land.
    219A.7   O fare you well, young man, she says,
         Farewell, and I bid adieu;
         Since youve provided a weed for me,
         Among the summer flowers,
         Then Ill provide another for you,
         Among the winter showers.
    219A.8   The new-fallen snow to be your smock;
         Becomes your body neat;
         And your head shall be deckd with the eastern wind,
         And the cold rain on your breast.

### 219B: The Gardener


    219B.1   ALL ye young men, I pray draw near,
         Ill let you hear my mind
         Concerning those who fickle are,
         And inconstant as the wind.
    219B.2   A pretty maid who late livd here,
         And sweetheatrs many had,
         The gardener-lad he viewd them all,
         Just as they came and gaed.
    219B.3   The gardener-lad he viewd them all,
         But swore he had no skill:
         If I were to go as oft to her,
         Ye surely would me kill.
    219B.4   Im sure shes not a proper maid,
         Im sure she is not tall;
         Another young man standing by,
         he said, Slight none at all.
    219B.5   For were all come of woman, he said,
         If ye woud call to mind,
         And to all women for her sake
         Ye surely should be kind.
    219B.6   The summer hours and warm showers
         Make the the trees yield in the ground,
         And kindly words will woman win,
         And this maid Ill surround.
    219B.7   The maid then stood in her bower-door,
         As straight as ony wand,
         When by it came the gardener-lad,
         With his hat in his hand.
    219B.8   Will ye live on fruit, he said?
         Or will ye marry me?
         And amongst the flowers in my garden
         Ill shape a weed for thee.
    219B.9   I will live on fruit, she says,
         But Ill never marry thee;
         For I can live without mankind,
         And without mankind Ill die.
    219B.10  Ye shall not live without mankind,
         If yell accept of me;
         For among the flowers in my garden
         Ill shape a weed for thee.
    219B.11  The lily white to be your smock;
         Becomes your body best;
         And the jelly-flower to be your quill,
         And the red rose in your breast.
    219B.12  Your gown shall be o the pingo white,
         Your petticoat cammovine,
         Your apron o the seel o downs;
         Come smile, sweet heart o mine!
    219B.13  Your shoes shall be o the gude rue red-+--+-
         Never did I garden ill-+--+-
         Your stockings o the mary mild;
         Come smile, sweet heart, your fill!
    219B.14  Your gloves shall be o the green clover,
         Comes lockerin to your hand,
         Well dropped oer wi blue blavers,
         That grow among white land.
    219B.15  Young man, yeve shapd a weed for me,
         In summer among your flowers;
         Now I will shape another for you,
         Among the winter showers.
    219B.16  The snow so white shall be your shirt;
         It becomes your body best;
         The cold bleak wind to be your coat,
         And the cold wind in your breast.
    219B.17  The steed that you shall ride upon
         Shall be o the weather snell,
         Well bridled wi the northern wind,
         And cold sharp showers o hail.
    219B.18  The hat you on your head shall wear
         Shall be o the weather gray,
         And aye when you come into my sight
         Ill wish you were away.

### 219C: The Gardener


    219C.1   BURD ELLEN stands in her bower-door,
         As straucht s a hollan wand,
         And by it comes the gairdner-lad,
         Wi a red rose in his hand.
    219C.2   Says, I have shapen a weed for thee
         Amang my simmer flowers;
         . . . .
         . . .
         * * * * *
    219C.3   Gin ye hae shapen a weed for me,
         Amang your simmer flowers,
         Its Ill repay ye back again,
         Amang the winter showers.
    219C.4   The steed that ye sall ride upon
         Sall be o the frost sae snell,
         And Ill saddle him wi the norlan winds,
         And some sharp showers o hail.
