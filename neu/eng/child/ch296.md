# 296A: Walter Lesly


    296A.1   On the second of October, a Monday at noon,
         In came Walter Lesly, to see his proper one;
         He sent a chair down by her side, and gently sat her by,
         Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
    296A.2   Hes taen a glass into his hand, inviting her to drink,
         But little knew she his meaning, or what the rogue did think;
         Nor what the rogue did think, to steal the maid away;
         Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
    296A.3   When they had taen a glass or two, and all were making merry,
         In came Geordy Lesly, and forth he did her carry;
         Then upon high horseback sae hards he did her tye,
         Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
    296A.4   Her mother she came to the door, the saut tears on her cheek,
         She coudna see her daughter, it was for dust and reek;
         It was for dust and reek, the swords they glancd sae high;
         And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
    296A.5   When they came to the ale-house, the people there were busy;
         A bridal-bed it was well made, and supper well made ready;
         When the supper down was set, baith plum-pudding and pie,
         And will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
    296A.6   When they had eaten and well drunken, and a man bound for bed,
         The laddie and the lassie in ae chamber were laid;
         He quickly stript her to the smock, and gently laid her bye,
         Says, Will ye go to Conland, this winter-time to lye?
    296A.7   But Walter being weary, he fell fast asleep,
         And then the lassie thought it fit to start up till her feet;
         To start up till her feet, and her petticoats to tye,
         Well go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
    296A.8   Then over moss and over muir sae cleverly she ran,
         And over hill and over dale, without stockings or shoon;
         The men pursued her full fast, wi mony shout and cry,
         Says, Will ye go to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
    296A.9   Wae to the dubs o Duffus land, that eer they were sae deep;
         Theyve trachled a our horsemen and gart our captain sleep;
         And gart our captain sleep, and the lassie win away,
         And shell go no more to Conland, the winter-time to lye.
    296A.10  Id rather be in Duffus land, selling at the ale,
         Before I was wi Lesly, for a his auld meal;
         For a his auld meal, and sae mony comes to buy;
         Ill go no more to Conland the winter-time to lye.
    296A.11  Id rather be in Duffus land, draggin at the ware,
         Before I was wi Lesly, for a his yellow hair;
         For a his yellow hair, and sae wells he can it tye;
         Ill go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.
    296A.12  It was not for her beauty, nor yet her gentle bluid,
         But for her mithers dollars, of them he had great need;
         Of them he had great need, now he maun do them by,
         For shell go no more to Conland, this winter-time to lye.
