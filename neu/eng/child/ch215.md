         And joy was in their gallant company;
         Its they have ridden up, and they have ridden down,

    215H.10  O had yer tongue, my daughter Ann,
         Nor scold na me about mourning;
         Hadna my son there men enew

         That were baith thick and many;
         Shes torn them a, lettin them fa,
         And shes away to the waters o Gemrie.
    215H.15  She[s] sought him up, shes sought him down,
         Until that shes gotten his body,
         And shes laid it on the green, green grass,
         And flung her mantle oer him.
    215H.16  O Willie was red, but O now hes white!
         And Willie was wondrous bonny,
         And Willie said hed marry me,
         Gin ere he married oney.
    215H.17  He was red, he was white, he was my delight,
         And aye, aye I thought him bonny;
         But now since Willie has dyd for me,
         I will sleep wi him in the same grave at Gemrie.
