    235A.1   THE Earl of Aboyne hes courteous and kind,
         Hes kind to every woman,
         And the Earl of Aboyne hes courteous and kind,
         But he stays ower lang in London.
    235A.2   The ladie she stood on her stair-head,
         Beholding his grooms a coming;
         She knew by their livery and raiment so rare
         That their last voyage was from London.
    235A.3   My grooms all, yell be well in call,
         Hold all the stables shining;
         With a bretther o degs yell clear up my nags,
         Sin my gude lord Aboyne is a coming.
    235A.4   My minstrels all, be well in call,
         Hold all my galleries ringing;
         With music springs yell try well your strings,
         Sin my gude lords a coming.
    235A.5   My cooks all, be well in call,
         Wi pots and spits well ranked;
         And nothing shall ye want that ye call for,
         Sin my gude Lord Aboynes a coming.
    235A.6   My chamber-maids, yell dress up my beds,
         Hold all my rooms in shining;
         With Dantzic waters yell sprinkle my walls,
         Sin my good lords a coming.
    235A.7   Her shoes was of the small cordain,
         Her stockings silken twisting;
         Cambrick so clear was the pretty ladys smock,
         And her stays o the braided sattin.
    235A.8   Her coat was of the white sarsenent,
         Set out wi silver quiltin,
         And her gown was o the silk damask,
         Set about wi red gold walting.
    235A.9   Her hair was like the threads of gold,
         Wi the silk and sarsanet shining,
         Wi her fingers sae white, and the gold rings sae grite,
         To welcome her lord from London.
    235A.10  Sae stately she steppit down the stair,
         And walkit to meet him coming;
         Said, O yer welcome, my bonny lord,
         Yer thrice welcome home from London!
    235A.11  If this be so that ye let me know,
         Yell come kiss me for my coming,
         For the morn should hae been my bonny wedding-day
         Had I stayed the night in London.
    235A.12  Then she turned her about wi an angry look,
         O for such a sorry woman!
         If this be so that ye let me know,
         Gang kiss your ladies in London.
    235A.13  Then he looked ower his left shoulder
         To the worthie companie wi him;
         Says he, Isna this an unworthy welcome
         The weve got, comin from London!
    235A.14  Get yer horse in call, my nobles all,
         And Im sorry for yer coming,
         But well horse, and awa to the bonny Bog o Gight,
         And then well go on to London.
    235A.15  If this be Thomas, as they call you,
         Youll see if hell hae me with him;
         And nothing shall he be troubled with me
         But myself and my waiting-woman.
    235A.16  Ive asked it already, lady, he says,
         And your humble servant, madam;
         But one single mile he winna lat you ride
         Wi his company and him to London.
    235A.17  A year and mare she lived in care,
         And docters wi her dealin,
         And with a crack her sweet heart brack,
         And the letters is on to London.
    235A.18  When the letters he got, they were all sealed in black,
         And he fell in a grievous weeping;
         He said, She is dead whom I loved best
         If I had but her heart in keepin.
    235A.19  Then fifteen o the finest lords
         That London could afford him,
         From their hose to their hat, they were all clad in black,
         For the sake of her corpse, Margaret Irvine.
    235A.20  The furder he gaed, the sorer he wept,
         Come keping her corpse, Margaret Irvine.
         Until that he came to the yetts of Aboyne,
         Where the corpse of his lady was lying.

    235D.17  She turned her about wie a very stingy look,
         She was as sorry as any woman;
         She threw a napkin out-oure her face,
         Says, Gang kiss your whore at London.
    235D.18  Yell mount an go, my gallan grooms a,
         Yell mount and back again to London;
         Had I known this to be the answer my Meggys gein me,
         I had stayed some longer at London.

         An he shall hae nae cumre o me

    235D.20  O the laus o London there very severe,
         They are not for a woman;
         And ye are too low in coach for to ride,

         An a his gallan gro[o]ms wie him;
         But his lady fair hes left behind
         Both a sick an a sorry woman.
    235D.24  O many were the letter she after him did send,
         A the way back again to London,
         An in less than a twelvemonth her heart it did break,
         For the loss o her lord at London.
    235D.25  He was not won well to the Bogs o the Geich,
         Nor his horses scarcely batit,

         Id rather lost a the Bogs o the Geich
         Or Id lost my bonny Peggy Harboun.
    235D.27  He took the table wi his foot,
         Made a the room to tremble:
         Id rather a lost a the Bogs o the Geich

         Hes awa, to remain in Lundon.
    235F.2   Shes called upon her waiting-maid
         To busk her in her claithin;
         Her sark was o cambrick very fine,
         And her bodice was the red buckskin.
    235F.3   Her stockings were o silk sae fine,
         And her shoon o the fine cordan;
         Her coat was o the guid green silk,
         Turnit up wi a siller warden.
    235F.4   Her goun was also o the silk,
         Turned up wi a siller warden,
         And stately tripped she doun the stair,
         As she saw her gude lord comin.
    235F.5   She gaed thro the close and grippit his horse,
         Saying, Yere welcome hame frae London!
         Gin that be true, come kiss me now,

    235F.6   For blythe and cantie may ye be,
         And thank me for my comin,
         For the morn would hae been my wedding-day
         Had I remained in London.
    235F.7   She turnd her richt and round about,
         She was a waefu woman:
         Gin the morn would hae been your weddin-day,

         The morn well dine in London.
    235F.9   She lived a year in meikle wae,
         And the doctors dealin wi her;
         At lang and last her heart it brast
         And the letters gade to London.
    235F.10  And when he saw the seals o black,
         He fell in a deadly weeping;
         He said, Shes dead whom I loed best,
         And she had my heart in keeping.
    235F.11  Loup on your steeds, ye nobles a,
         Im sorry for our comin;
         Frae our horse to our hat, well gae in black,
         And well murn for Peggy Irwine.

         And all his nobles with him;
         For a the braw ribbands he wore at his hat,
         He has left his lady behind him.
    235G.2   Shes called on her little foot-page,
         And Jean, her gentlewoman;
         Said, Fill to me a full pint of wine,
         And Ill drink it at my lords coming.
    235G.3   Youre welcome, youre welcome, youre welcome, she says,
         Youre welcome home from London!
         If I be as welcome as you now say,
         Come kiss me, my bonnie Peggy Irvine.
    235G.4   Come kiss me, come kiss me, my lady, he says,
         Come kiss me for my coming,
         For the morn should hae been my wedding-day,
         Had I staid any longer in London.
    235G.5   She turned about with an angry look,
         Said, Woes me for your coming!
         If the morn should hae been your wedding-day,
         Go back to your whore in London.
    235G.6   Hes called on his little foot-page,
         Said, Saddle both sure and swiftly,
         And Il away to the Bogs o the Gay,
         And speak wi the Marquis o Huntly.

         Said, See if hell take me with him;
         And he shall hae nae mair cumber o me
         But myself and my servant-woman.
    235G.8   O London streets they are too strait,
         They are not for a woman,
         And it is too low to ride in coach wi me
         With your humble servant-woman.
    235G.9   He had not been at the Bogs o the Gay,
         Nor yet his horse was baited,
         Till a boy with a letter came to his hand
         That his lady was lying streekit.
    235G.10  O woe! O woe! O woe! he says,
         O woes me for my coming!
         I had rather lost the Bogs o the Gay
         Or Id lost my bonny Peggy Irvine.
    235G.11  O woe! O woe! O woe! he said,
         O woe to the Marquis o Huntly,
         Gard the Earl of Aboyne prove very unkind

         Nor a day into the city,
         Until that the letters they came to him,
         And the ladies they did invite him.
    235H.3   His lady has lookit oer her left shoulder,
         To see if she saw him coming,
         And then she saw her ain good lord,
         Just newly come from London.
    235H.4   Come kiss me, my dear, come kiss me, he said,
         Come kiss me for my coming,
         For if I had staid another day in town
         Tomorrow I would hae been married in Lunnon.
    235H.5   She turned about wi a very saucy look,
         As saucy as eer did a woman;
         Says, If a be true that Ive heard of you,
         You may go back and kiss your whores in Lunnon.
    235H.6   Go call on Jack, my waiting-man, he said,
         Go saddle and make him ready;
         For I maun away to the Bughts o Gight,
         To speak to the Marquess of Huntly.
    235H.7   He had not been at the Bughts of the Gight,
         Nor the horses yet weel bated,
         Until that the letters came ta him
         That his lady was newly streeket.
    235H.8   Waes me, my dear! waes me! he said,

         He has left his lady behind him.
    235I.2   She has to her high castle gane,
         To see if she saw him coming;
         And who did she spy but her own servant Jack,
         Coming riding home again from London.
    235I.3   What news, what news, my own servant Jack?
         What news have you got from London?
         Good news, good news, my lady, he says,
         For the Earl of Aboyne he is coming.
    235I.4   She has to her kitchen-maid gane:
         Set your pots and your pans all a boiling;
         Have every thing fine for gentry to dine,
         For the Earl of Aboyne he is coming.
    235I.5   Stable-grooms all, pray be well employed,
         Set your stable-bells all a ringing;
         Let your hecks be overlaid with the finest of good hay,
         For the Earl of Aboyne he is coming.
    235I.6   She has to her low gates gane,
         To see if she saw him coming,
         And long seven miles before they came to town
         She heard their bridles ringing.
    235I.7   Come kiss me, come kiss me, madam, he says,
         Come kiss me for my coming,
         For the morn should hae been my wedding-day

    235I.9   Theyve turned their horses heads around,
         Their faces all for London;
         With their hands to their hats they all rode off,
         And theyre all away to London.

### 235J: The Earl of Aboyne


    235J.1   THE Earl of Aboyne has up to London gone,
         And all his nobles with him,
         And three broad letters he sent into his love
         He would wed another woman in London.
    235J.2   She has turned the honey month about,
         To see if he was coming,
         And lang three miles ere he came to the town
         She heard his bridle ringing.
    235J.3   Shes went down unto the close and shes taen him from his horse,
         Says, Yere welcome home from London!
         If I be as welcome, dear Peggy, as you say,
         Come kiss me for my coming.
    235J.4   Come kiss me, come kiss me, dear Peggy, he said,
         Come kiss me for my coming,
         For tomorrow should have been my wedding-day
         Had I tarried any longer in London.
    235J.5   She has turned herself round about,
         And she was an angry woman:
         If tomorrow should have been your wedding-day,
         You may kiss with your sweethearts in London.
    235J.6   Go saddle me my steed, he said,
         Saddle and make him ready;
         For I must away to the bonny Bog of Keith,
         For to visit the Marquis of Huntley.
    235J.7   Go ask him, go ask, dear Thomas, she said,
         Go ask if hell take me with him;
         Ive asked him once, and Ill ask him no more,
         For yell never ride a mile in his company.
    235J.8   Go make to me my bed, she said,
         Make it soft and narrow;
         For since my true lover has slighted me so,
         I will die for him ere morrow.
    235J.9   She has called her waiting-man,
         And Jean her gentlewoman:
         Go bring to me a glass of red wine,
         For Im as sick as any woman.
    235J.10  The bed it was not made nor well laid down,
         Nor yet the curtains drawn on,
         Till stays and gown and all did burst,
         And its alace for bonny Peggy Irvine!
    235J.11  The Earl of Aboyne was not at the Bog of Keith,
         Nor met wi the Marquis of Huntley,
         Till three broad etters were sent after him
         That his pretty Peggy Irvine had left him.
    235J.12  He gave such a rap on the table where he sat
         It made all the room for to tremble:
         I would rather I had lost all the rents of Aboyne
         Than have lost my pretty Peggy Irvine.
