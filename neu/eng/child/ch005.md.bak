    5C.34   In that chair nae leal maiden
        Eer sits down till they be bidden.

    5C.52   Then to the chamber his mother flew,

    5D.4    Now she must to the grenewood gang,
        To pu the nuts in grenewood hang.
    5D.5    She hadna tarried an hour but ane
        Till she met wi a highlan groom.
    5D.6    He keeped her sae late and lang
        Till the evening set and birds they sang.
    5D.7    He gae to her at their parting
        A chain o gold and gay gold ring;
    5D.8    And three locks o his yellow hair;
        Bade her keep them for evermair.
    5D.9    When six lang months were come and gane.
        A courtier to this lady came.
    5D.10   Lord Dingwall courted this lady gay,
        And so he set their wedding-day.
    5D.11   A little boy to the ha was sent,
        To bring her horse was his intent.
    5D.12   As she was riding the way along,
        She began to make a heavy moan.
    5D.13   What ails you, lady, the boy said,
        That ye seem sae dissatisfied?
    5D.14   Are the bridle reins for you too strong?
        Or the stirrups for you too long?
    5D.15   But, little boy, will ye tell me
        The fashions that are in your countrie?
    5D.16   The fashions in our ha Ill tell,
        And o them a Ill warn you well.
    5D.17   When ye come in upon the floor,

    5D.19   Lord Dingwall aft has been beguild
        By girls whom young men hae defiled.
    5D.20   Hes cutted the paps frae their breast-bane,

    5D.21   When she came in upon the floor,
        His mother met her wi a golden chair.
    5D.22   But to the high seat she made her boun:
        She knew that maiden she was nane.
    5D.23   When night was come, they went to bed,
        And ower her breast his arm he laid.
    5D.24   He quickly jumped upon the floor,
        And said, Ive got a vile rank whore.
    5D.25   Unto his mother he made his moan,
        Says, Mother dear, I am undone.
    5D.26   Yeve aft tald, when I brought them hame,
        Whether they were maid or nane.
    5D.27   I thought Id gotten a maiden bright;
        Ive gotten but a waefu wight.
    5D.28   I thought Id gotten  a maiden clear,
        But gotten but a vile rank whore.
    5D.29   When she came in upon the floor,
        I met her wi a golden chair.
    5D.30   But to the high seat she made her boun,
        Because a maiden she was nane.
    5D.31   I wonder whas tauld that gay ladie
        The fashion into our countrie.
    5D.32   It is your little boy I blame,
        Whom ye did send to bring her hame.
    5D.33   Then to the lady she did go,
        And said, O Lady, let me know
    5D.34   Who has defiled your fair bodie:
        Yere the first that has beguiled me.
    5D.35   O we were sisters, sisters seven,
        The fairest women under heaven.
    5D.36   And we kiest kevels us amang,
        Wha woud to the grenewood gang;
    5D.37   For to pu the finest flowers,
        To put around our summer bowers.

    5D.43   And three locks o his yellow hair;
        Bade me keep them for evermair.
    5D.44   Then for to show I make nae lie,
        Look ye my trunk, and ye will see.
    5D.45   Unto the trunk then she did go,
        To see if that were true or no.
    5D.46   And aye she sought, and aye she flang,
        Till these four things came to her hand.
    5D.47   Then she did to her ain son go,
        And said, My son, yell let me know,
    5D.48   Ye will tell to me this thing:
        What did you wi my wedding-ring?
    5D.49   Mother dear, Ill tell nae lie:
        I gave it to a gay ladie.
    5D.50   I would gie a my has and towers,
        I had this bird within my bowers.
    5D.51   Keep well, keep well your lands and strands;
        Ye hae that bird within your hands.
    5D.52   Now, my son, to your bower yell go:
        Comfort your ladie, shes full o woe.
    5D.53   Now when nine months were come and gane,
        The lady she brought hame a son.
    5D.54   It was written on his breast-bane
        Lord Dingwall was his fathers name.
    5D.55   Hes taen his young son in his arms,
        And aye he praisd his lovely charms.
    5D.56   And he has gien him kisses three,
        And doubled them ower to his ladie.

    5E.2    As he was walking late alone,
        He spyed a lady both brisk and young.
    5E.3    He keeped her so long and long,
        From the evening late till the morning came.
    5E.4    All that he gave her at their parting
        Was a pair of gloves and a gay gold ring.
    5E.5    Lord Benwall hes a wooing gone,
        And hes taken with him all his merry men.
    5E.6    As he was walking the Haleigh throw,
        He spyd seven ladyes all in a row.
    5E.7    He cast a lot among them all;
        Upon the youngest the lot did fall.
    5E.8    He wedded her and brought her home,
        And by the way she made great moan.
    5E.9    What aileth my dearest and dayly flower?
        What ails my dear, to make such moan?
    5E.10   Does the steed carry you too high?
        Or does thy pillow sit awry?
    5E.11   Or does the wind blow in thy glove?
        Or is thy heart after another love?

        Nor does my pillow sit awry.

    5E.14   When they were doun to supper set,
        The weary pain took her by the back.
    5E.15   What ails my dearest and dayly flower?
        What ails my dearest, to make such moan?
    5E.16   I am with child, and its not to thee,
        And oh and alas, what shall I doe!
    5E.17   I thought I had got a maid so mild;
        But I have got a woman big with child.
    5E.18   I thought I had got a dayly flower;
        I have gotten but a common whore.
        * * * * *
    5E.19   Rise up, Lord Benwall, go to your hall,
        And cherrish up your merry men all.
        * * * * *
    5E.20   As I was walking once late alone,
        I spyd a lord, both brisk and young.

        Theres the key of my coffer, you may go and see.
    5E.24   His mother went, and threw and flang,
        Till to her hand the ring it came.
    5E.25   Lord Benwall, wilt thou tell to me
        Where is the ring I gave to thee?
    5E.26   Now I would give all my lands and tower,
        To have that lady in my bower.
    5E.27   I would give all my lands and rents,
        To have that lady in my tents.
    5E.28   You need not give all your lands and tower,
        For you have that lady in your power.
    5E.29   You need not give all your lands and rents,
        For you have that lady in your tents.
    5E.30   Now it was written on the childs breast-bone
        Lord Benwalls sirname and his name.
    5E.31   It was written on the childs right hand
        That he should be heir of Lord Benwalls land.
    5E.32   Canst cloath my lady in the silk,
        And feed my young son with the milk.

        And on the youngest his lot did fa.
    5G.3    Hes brought her frae her mothers bower,
        Unto his strongest castle and tower.
    5G.4    But ay she cried and made great moan,
        And ay the tear came trickling down.
    5G.5    Come up, come up, said the foremost man,
        I think our bride comes slowly on.
    5G.6    O lady, sits your saddle awry,
        Or is your steed for you owre high?
    5G.7    My saddle is not set awry,
        Nor carries me my steed owre high;
    5G.8    But I am weary of my life,
        Since I maun be Lord Bothwells wife.
    5G.9    Hes blawn his horn sae sharp and shrill,
        Up start the deer on evry hill.

        What ails my love on me to frown?
    5G.15   Or does the wind blow in your glove?
        Or runs your mind on another love?
    5G.16   Nor blows the wind within my glove,
        Nor runs my mind on another love;
    5G.17   But I nor maid nor maiden am,
        For Im wi bairn to another man.
    5G.18   I thought Id a maiden sae meek and sae mild,
        But Ive nought but a woman wi child.
    5G.19   His mothers taen her up to a tower,
        And lockit her in her secret bower.
    5G.20   Now, doughter mine, come tell to me,
        Whas bairn this is that you are wi.

        I met a gentleman gallant and fine.
    5G.23   He keepit me there sae late and sae lang,
        Frae the evning late till the morning dawn.
    5G.24   And a that he gied me to my propine
        Was a pair of green gloves and a gay gold ring;
    5G.25   Three lauchters of his yellow hair,
        In case that we shoud meet nae mair.
    5G.26   His lady mother went down the stair:
        . . .
    5G.27   Now son, now son, come tell to me,
        Wheres the green gloves I gave to thee?
    5G.28   I gied to a lady sae fair and so fine
        The green gloves and a gay gold ring.
    5G.29   But I wad gie my castles and towers,
        I had that lady within my bowers.
    5G.30   But I wad gie my very life,
        I had that lady to be my wife.
