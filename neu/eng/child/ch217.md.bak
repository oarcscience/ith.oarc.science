# 217A: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217A.1   THERE was a troop of merry gentlemen
         Was riding atween twa knows,
         And they heard the voice of a bonny lass,
         In a bught milking her ews.
    217A.2   Theres ane o them lighted frae off his steed,
         And has tyd him to a tree,
         And hes gane away to yon ew-bught,
         To hear what it might be.
    217A.3   O pity me, fair maid, he said,
         Take pity upon me;
         O pity me, and my milk-white steed
         Thats trembling at yon tree.
    217A.4   As for your steed, he shall not want
         The best of corn and hay;
         But as to you yoursel, kind sir,
         Ive naething for to say.
    217A.5   Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the green gown-sleeve,
         And he as led her into the ew-bught,
         Of her friends he speerd nae leave.
    217A.6   He as put his hand in his pocket,
         And given her guineas three:
         If I dinna come back in half a year,
         Then luke nae mair for me.
    217A.7   Now show to me the kings hie street,
         Now show to me the way;
         Now show to me the kings hie street,
         And the fair water of Tay.
    217A.8   She showd to him the kings hie street,
         She showd to him the way;
         She showd him the way that he was to go,
         By the fair water of Tay.
    217A.9   When she came home, her father said,
         Come, tell to me right plain;
         I doubt youve met some in the way,
         You have not been your lain.
    217A.10  The night it is baith mist and mirk,
         You may gan out and see;
         The night is mirk and misty too,
         Theres nae body been wi me.
    217A.11  There was a tod came to your flock,
         The like I neer did see;
         When he spake, he lifted his hat,
         He had a bonny twinkling eee.
    217A.12  When fifteen weeks were past and gane,
         Full fifteen weeks and three,
         Then she began to think it lang
         For the man wi the twinkling eee.
    217A.13  It fell out on a certain day,
         When she cawd out her fathers ky,
         There was a troop of gentlemen
         Came merrily riding by.
    217A.14  Weel may ye sigh and sob, says ane,
         Weel may you sigh and see;
         Weel may you sigh, and say, fair maid,
         Whas gotten this bairn wi thee?
    217A.15  She turned her sel then quickly about,
         And thinking meikle shame,
         O no, kind sir, it is na sae,
         For it has a dad at hame.
    217A.16  O hawd your tongue, my bonny lass,
         Sae loud as I hear you lee!
         For dinna you mind that summer night
         I was in the bught wi thee?
    217A.17  He lighted off his milk-white steed,
         And set this fair maid on;
         Now caw out your ky, good father, he said,
         Shell neer caw them out again.
    217A.18  I am the laird of Knottington,
         Ive fifty plows and three;
         Ive gotten now the bonniest lass
         That is in the hale country.

### 217B: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217B.1   IT was on an evning sae saft and sae clear
         A bonny lass was milking the kye,
         And by came a troup of gentlemen,
         And rode the bonny lassie by.
    217B.2   Then one of them said unto her,
         Bonny lass, prythee shew me the way:
         O if I do sae, it may breed me wae,
         For langer I dare nae stay.
         * * * * *
    217B.3   But dark and misty was the night
         Before the bonny lass came hame:
         Now where hae you been, my ae doughter?
         I am sure you was nae your lane.
    217B.4   O father, a tod has come oer your lamb,
         A gentleman of high degree,
         And ay whan he spake he lifted his hat,
         And bonny, bonny blinkit his ee.
    217B.5   Or eer six months were past and gane,
         Six months but and other three,
         The lassie begud for to fret and to frown,
         And think lang for his blinkin ee.
    217B.6   O wae be to my fathers shepherd,
         An ill death may he die!
         He bigged the bughts sae far frae hame,
         And trysted a gentleman to me!
    217B.7   It fell upon another fair evening
         The bonny lassie was milking her ky,
         And by came the troop of Gentlemen,
         And rode the bonny lassie by.
    217B.8   Then one of them stopt, and said to her,
         Whaes aught that baby ye are wi?
         That lassie began for to blush, and think,
         To a father as good as ye.
    217B.9   O had your tongue, my bonny may,
         Sae loud I hear you lie!
         O dinnae you mind the misty night
         I was in the bught with thee?
    217B.10  Now hes come aff his milk-white steed,
         And he has taen her hame:
         Now let your father bring hame the ky,
         You neer mair shall ca them agen.
    217B.11  I am a lord of castles and towers,
         With fifty ploughs of land and three,
         And I have gotten the bonniest lass
         That is in this countrie.

### 217C: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217C.1   IT was on a day whan a lovely may
         Was cawing out her fathers kye,
         And she spied a troop o gentlemen,
         As they war passing bye.
    217C.2   O show me the way, my pretty maid,
         O show me the way, said he;
         My steed has just now rode wrong,
         And the way I canna see.
    217C.3   O haud you on the same way, she said,
         O haud ye ont again,
         For, if ye haud on the kings hieway,
         Rank rievers will do ye na harm.
    217C.4   He took her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the gerss-green sleeve,
         And he has taiglet wi the fair may,
         And of her he askd na leave.
    217C.5   Whan ance he got her gudwill,
         Of her he craved na mair,
         But he poud out a ribbon frae his pouch,
         And snooded up the mays hair.
    217C.6   He put his hand into his pouch,
         And gave her guineas three:
         If I come na back in twenty weeks,
         Ye need na look mair for me.
    217C.7   But whan the may did gang hame,
         Her father did her blame;
         Whare hae ye been now, dame? he said
         For yeve na been your lane.
    217C.8   The nicht is misty and mirk, father,
         Ye may come to the door and see;
         The nicht is misty and mirk, father,
         And theres na body wi me.
    217C.9   But there cam o tod to your flock, father,
         The like o him I never saw;
         Or he had tane the lambie that he had,
         I wad rather he had tane them aw.
    217C.10  But he seemd to be a gentleman,
         Or a man of some pious degree;
         For whanever he spak, he lifted up his hat,
         And he had [a] bonnie twinkling ee.
    217C.11  Whan twenty weeks were come and gane,
         Twenty weeks and three,
         The lassie began to grow thick in the waist,
         And thoucht lang for his twinkling ee.
    217C.12  It fell upon a day whan bonnie may
         Was cawing out the kye,
         She spied the same troop o gentlemen,
         As they war passing bye.
    217C.13  O well may you save, my pretty may,
         Weill may you save and see!
         Weill may ye save, my lovely may!
         Go ye wi child to me?
    217C.14  But the may she turnd her back to him,
         She begoud to think meikle shame;
         Na, na, na, na, kind sir, she said,
         Ive a gudeman o my ain.
    217C.15  Sae loud as I hear ye lie, fair may,
         Sae loud as I hear ye lee!
         Dinna ye mind o yon misty nicht
         Whan I was in the bucht wi thee?
    217C.16  He lichted aff his hie, hie horse,
         And he set the bonnie may on:
         Now caw out your kye, gud father,
         Ye maun caw them out your lone.
    217C.17  For lang will ye caw them out,
         And weary will ye be,
         Or ye get your dochter again
         . . .
    217C.18  He was the laird o Ochiltree,
         Of therty ploughs and three,
         And he has stown awa the loveliest may
         In aw the south cuntree.

         For to milk her daddies yowes,
         And ay she sang, and her voice it rang
         Out-ower the tap o the knows, knows, knowes,
         Out-owr the tap o the knowes.
    217D.2   Ther cam a troop gentilmen,
         As they were rydand by,
         And ane o them he lichtit doun,
         For to see May milkand her kye.

         For out o the buchts I winna gang
         Till ye shaw me owr the lee.
    217D.4   Ryde on, ryde on, ye rank rydars,
         Your steeds are stout and strang,
         For out o the yowe-buchts I winna gae,
         For fear that ye do me some wrang.
    217D.5   He took her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the green gown-sleive,
         And thare he took the will o her,
         Bot o her he askit nae leive.
    217D.6   But whan he gat his will o her

         And, gin I be na back in three quarters o a year,

    217D.8   He put out a silken purse
         And he gied her guineas thrie,
         Saying, Gin I may na be back in three quarters o a year,
         It will pay the nourice fee.
    217D.9   He put his fut into the stirrup
         And rade after his men,
         And a that his men said or did
         Was, Kind maister, yeve taiglit lang.
    217D.10  I hae rade east, I hae rade wast,
         And I hae rade owr the knowes,
         But the bonniest lassie that I ever saw
         Was in the yowe-buchts, milkand her yowes.
    217D.11  She put the pail upon her heid,
         And shes gane merrilie hame,
         And a that her faither said or did

         For they cawit a the yowes out-owre the knowes,
         And they left naebody wi me.
    217D.13  There cam a tod unto the bucht,
         The like I never saw,
         And afore that he took the ane that he took,
         I wad leifar he had tane ither twa.
    217D.14  There cam a tod unto the bucht,
         The like I never did see,
         And, ay as he spak, he liftit his hat,
         And he had a bonnie twinkland ee.
    217D.15  It was on a day, and it was a fine simmer day,

         And I hae tane awa the bonniest lass
         That is in a the north countrie.

### 217E: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217E.1   THERE was a may, and a bonnie may,
         In the bught, milking the ewes,
         And by came a troop of gentlemen,
         And they rode by and by.
    217E.2   O Ill give thee my milk-white steed,
         It cost me three hundred pound,
         If yell go to yon sheep-bught,
         And bring yon fair maid doun.
    217E.3   Your steed ye canna want, master,
         But pay to ane a fee;
         Fifty pound of good red gold,
         To be paid down to me.
    217E.4   Come shew me the way, pretty may, he said,
         For our steeds are quite gone wrong;
         Will you do to me such a courtesy
         As to shew us the near-hand way?
    217E.5   O go ye doun to yon meadow,
         Where the people are mowing the hay;
         Go ye doun to yon meadow,
         And theyll shew you the near-hand way.
    217E.6   But hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve;
         Hes bowed her body to the ground,
         Of her kin he asked no leave.
    217E.7   When he lifted her up again
         Hes gien her guineas three:
         If I be na back gin three quarters o a year,
         Ye need neer think mair on me.
         * * * * *
    217E.8   O where hast thou been, bonnie may, he said,
         O where hast thou been sae lang?
         O where hast thou been, bonnie may? he said,
         Thou hast na been sae lang thy lane.
    217E.9   O come to the door and see, father,
         O come to the door and see,
         And see such a weety and a windy night;
         There were nobody wi me.
    217E.10  But wae be to your herd, father,
         And an ill death may he die!
         For he left the ewes strayed owre the knowes,
         And he left naebody wi me.
    217E.11  But there came a tod to your bught, father,
         The like o him I neer saw;
         For or he had taen the bonnie lamb he took,
         Ye had as weel hae gien them a.
    217E.12  There came a tod to your bught, father,
         The like o him I neer did see;
         For aye when he spak he lifted up his hat,
         And he had a bonnie twinkling ee.
    217E.13  But when twenty weeks were come and gane,
         Aye, twenty weeks and three,
         This lassie began to spit and to spew,
         And to lang for the twinkling ee.
    217E.14  It fell on a day, and a bonnie summer day,
         She was caing out her fathers kye,
         And by came a troop of gentlemen,
         And they rode by and by.
    217E.15  O wha got the bairn wi thee, bonnie may?
         O wha got the bairn wi thee?
         . . . .
         . . . .
    217E.16  She turned hersell right round about,
         She began to blush and think shame,
         And never a word this bonnie lassie spok
         But I have a good-man at hame.
    217E.17  Thou lie, thou lie, my bonnie may,
         Sae loud I hear thee lie!
         Do ye mind o the weety and windy night
         When I was in the ewe-bught wi thee?
    217E.18  Light off, light off, the gentlest of my men,
         And set her on behind,
         And ca out your kye, good father, yoursell,
         For shell never ca them out again.
    217E.19  He was the laird o twenty plough o land,
         Aye, twenty plough and three,
         And hes taen awa the bonniest lass
         Was in a the south countrie.

### 217F: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217F.1   BONNY MAY has to the ewe-bughts gane,
         To milk her fathers ewes,
         An aye as she milked her bonny voice rang
         Far out amang the knowes.
         * * * * *
    217F.2   Milk on, milk on, my bonny, bonny may,

         Will ye shew me out-ower the lea?
    217F.3   Ride on, ride on, stout rider, she said,
         Yere steeds baith stout and strang;
         For out o the eww-bught I daurna come,
         For fear ye do me wrang.
    217F.4   But hes tane her by the milk-white hand,
         An by the green gown-sleeve,
         An hes laid her low on the dewy grass,
         An at nae ane spiered he leave.
    217F.5   Then hes mounted on his milk-white steed,
         An ridden after his men,
         An a that his men they said to him

         An Ive ridden amang the knowes,
         But the bonniest lassie eer I saw
         Was milkin her daddies yowes.
    217F.7   Shes taen the milk-pail on her heid,
         An shes gane langin hame,
         An a her father said to her

    217F.8   Oh, wae be to your shepherds! father,
         For they take nae care o the sheep;
         Fro theyve bygit the ewe-bught far frae hame,
         An theyve trysted a man to me.

         Weel may ye save and see!
         Weel I wat ye be a very bonny may,
         But whaes aught that babe ye are wi?
    217G.22  Never a word could that lassie say,
         For never a ane could she blame,
         An never a word could the lassie say,
         But, I have a good man at hame.
    217G.23  Ye lied, ye lied, my very bonny may,

         But I am one of her mothers maids,
         And oft in her companie.
    217L.9   Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by her grass-green sleeve,
         Hes set her down upon the ground
         Of her kin spierd nae leave.
    217L.10  Hes gien her a silver comb,
         To comb her yellow hair;
         He bade her keep it for his sake,
         For fear she never got mair.
    217L.11  He pat his hand in his pocket,
         Hes gien her guineas three;
         Says, Take ye that, fair maid, he says,
         Twill pay the nourices fee.
    217L.12  Shes taen the milk-pail on her head,
         And she gaed singing hame,
         And a that her auld father did say,
         Daughter, yeve tarried lang.
    217L.13  Woe be to your shepherd, father,
         And an ill death mat he die!
         Hes biggit the bught sae far frae the town,
         And trystit a man to me.
    217L.14  There came a tod into the bught,
         The like o m I neer did see;
         Before hed taen the lamb hes taen,
         Id rather hed taen other three.
    217L.15  Or eer six months were past and gane,
         Six months but other three,
         This lassie begud for to fret and frown,
         And lang for his blinking ee.
    217L.16  It fell upon another day,
         When caing out her fathers kye,
         That by came the troop o gentlemen,
         Sae merrily riding by.
    217L.17  Then ane of them stopt, and said to her,
         Whas aught that bairn yere wi?
         The lassie began for to blush, and think,
         To a father as good as ye.
    217L.18  She turnd her right and round about
         And thought nae little shame;
         Then a to him that she did say,
         Ive a father to my bairn at hame.
    217L.19  Ye lie, ye lie, ye well-fared may,
         Sae louds I hear ye lie!
         For dinna ye mind yon misty night
         I was in the bught wi thee?
    217L.20  I gave you a silver comb,
         To comb your yellow hair;
         I bade you keep it for my sake,
         For fear yed never get mair.
    217L.21  I pat my hand in my pocket,
         I gae you guineas three;
         I bade you keep them for my sake,
         And pay the nourices fee.
    217L.22  Hes lappen aff his berry-brown steed
         And put that fair maid on;
         Ca hame your kye, auld father, he says,
         She shall never mair return.
    217L.23  I am the laird o the Rock-rock lays,
         Hae thirty ploughs and three,
         And this day will wed the fairest maid
         That eer my eyes did see.
         O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom grows oer the burn!
         Aye when she minds on his yellow hair,
         She shall neer hae cause to mourn.

### 217M: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217M.1   TWAS on a misty day, a fair maiden gay
         Went out to the Cowdenknowes;
         Lang, lang she thought ere her ewes woud bught,
         Wi her pail for to milk the ewes.
         O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
         And aye sae sweet as the lassie sang,
         In the ewe-bught, milking her ewes.
    217M.2   And aye as she sang the greenwoods rang,
         Her voice was sae loud and shrill;
         They heard the voice of this well-fard maid
         At the other side o the hill.
    217M.3   My mother she is an ill woman,
         And an ill woman is she;
         Or than she might have got some other maid
         To milk her ewes without me.
    217M.4   My father was ance a landed laird,
         As mony mair have been;
         But he held on the gambling trade
         Till a s free lands were dune.
    217M.5   My father drank the brandy and beer,
         My mother the wine sae red;
         Gars me, poor girl, gang maiden lang,
         For the lack o tocher guid.
    217M.6   There was a troop o merry gentlemen
         Came riding alang the way,
         And one o them drew the ewe-bughts unto,
         At the voice of this lovely may.
    217M.7   O well may you sing, my well-fard maid,
         And well may you sing, I say,
         For this is a mirk and a misty night,
         And Ive ridden out o my way.
    217M.8   Ride on, ride on, young man, she said,
         Ride on the way ye ken;
         But keep frae the streams o the Rock-river,
         For they run proud and vain.
    217M.9   Ye winna want boys for meat, kind sir,
         And ye winna want men for fee;
         It sets not us that are young women
         To show young men the way.
    217M.10  O winna ye pity me, fair maid?
         O winna ye pity me?
         O winna ye pity my poor steed,
         Stnads trembling at yon tree?
    217M.11  Ride on, ride on, ye rank rider,
         Your steeds baith stout and strang;
         For out o the ewe-bught I winna come,
         For fear that ye do me wrang.
    217M.12  For well ken I by your high-colld hat,
         And by your gay gowd ring,
         That ye are the Earl o Rock-rivers,
         That beguiles a our young women.
    217M.13  O Im not the earl o the Rock-rivers,
         Nor ever thinks to be;
         But I am ane o his finest knights,
         Rides aft in his companie.
    217M.14  I know you well by your lamar beads,
         And by your merry winking ee,
         That ye are the maid o the Cowdenknowes,
         And may very well seem to be.
    217M.15  Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve,
         Hes laid her down by the ewe-bught-wa,
         At her he spiered nae leave.
    217M.16  When he had had got his wills o her,
         And his wills he had taen,
         He lifted her up by the middle sae sma,
         Says, Fair maid, rise up again.
    217M.17  Then he has taen out a siller kaim,
         Kaimd down her yellow hair;
         Says, Fair maid, take that, keep it for my sake,
         Case frae me ye never get mair.
    217M.18  Then he put his hand in his pocket,
         And gien her guineas three;
         Says, Take that, fair maiden, till I return,
         Twill pay the nurses fee.
    217M.19  Then he  lap on his milk-white steed,
         And he rade after his men,
         And a that they did say to him,
         Dear master, ye ve tarried lang.
    217M.20  Ive ridden east, Ive ridden west,
         And over the cowdenknowes,
         But the bonniest lass that eer I did see,
         Was i the ewe-bught, milking her ewes.
    217M.21  Shes taen her milk-pail on her head,
         And she gaed singing hame;
         But a that her auld father did say,
         Daughter, yeve tarried lang.
         O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
         Aye sae sair s I may rue the day,
         In the ewe-bughts, milking my ewes.
    217M.22  O this is a mirk and a misty night,
         O father, as ye may see;
         The ewes they ran skipping over the knowes,
         And they woudna bught in for me.
    217M.23  . . . .
         . . . .
         Before that hed taen the lamb that he took,
         I rather hed taen other three.
    217M.24  When twenty weeks were come and gane,
         And twenty weeks and three,
         The lassies colour grew pale and wan,
         And she longed this knight to see.
    217M.25  Says, Wae to the fox came amo our flock!
         I wish he had taen them a
         Before that hed taen frae me what he took;
         Its occasiond my downfa.
    217M.26  It fell ance upon a time
         She was caing hame her kye,
         There came a troop o merry gentlemen,
         And they wyled the bonny lassie by.
    217M.27  But one o them spake as he rode past,
         Says, Who owes the bairn ye are wi?
         A little she spake, but thought wi hersell,
         Perhaps to ane as gude as thee.
    217M.28  O then she did blush as he did pass by,
         And dear! but she thought shame,
         And all that she did say to him,
         Sir, I have a husband at hame.
    217M.29  Ye lie, ye lie, ye well-fard maid,
         Sae loud as I hear you lie!
         For dinna ye mind yon misty night,
         Ye were in the bught wi me?
         O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
         Aye sae sweet as I heard you sing,
         In the ewe-bughts, milking your ewes.
    217M.30  O well do I mind, kind sir, she said,
         As ye rode over the hill;
         Ye took frae me my maidenhead,
         Fell sair against my will.
         O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
         And aye sae sair as I rue the day
         I met you, milking my ewes.
    217M.31  And aye as ye spake, ye lifted your hat,
         Ye had a merry winking ee;
         I ken you well to be the man,
         Then kind sir, O pity me!
    217M.32  Win up, win up, fair maiden, he said,
         Nae langer here yell stay;
         This night yese be my wedded wife,
         Without any more delay.
    217M.33  He lighted aff his milk-white steed
         And set the lassie on;
         Ca in your kye, auld man, he did say,
         Shell never ca them in again.
    217M.34  I am the Earl o the Rock-rivers,
         Hae fifty ploughs and three,
         And am sure Ive chosen the fairest maid
         That ever my eyes did see.
    217M.35  Then he stript her o the robes o grey,
         Donned her in the robes o green,
         And when she came to her lords ha
         They took her to be some queen.
         O the broom, the bonny, bonny broom,
         The broom o the Cowdenknowes!
         And aye sae sweet as the bonny lassie sang,
         That ever she milked the ewes.

### 217N: The Broom of Cowdenknows


    217N.1   O THERE war a troop o merry gentlemen
         Cam riding oure the knowes,
         And they hear the voice o a bonny lass,
         In the bichts, milking the yowes.
    217N.2   O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may!
         O saved may ye be!
         My steed he has riden wrang,
         Fain wad I ken the way.
    217N.3   She has tane the steed by the bridle-reins,
         Has led him till the way,
         And he has tane out three gowd rings,
         Gien them to that bonnie may.
    217N.4   And he has tane her by the milk-white hand
         And by the gerss-green sleeve,
         And he laid her doun on the side o yon hill,
         At her daddie speird na leave.
    217N.5   Now she has hame to her father gane,
         Her father did her blame:
         O whare hae ye been, my ae dochter?
         For ye hae na been your lane.
    217N.6   O the nicht is mirk, and very, very wet,
         Ye may gang to the door and see;
         O theres nabody been wi me, father,
         Theres nabody been wi me.
    217N.7   But there cam a tod to your bucht, father,
         The like o him I neer saw;
         Afore youd gien him the lamb that he took,
         Yed rather hae gien them a.
    217N.8   O wae be to my fathers sheep-hird,
         An ill death may he dee!
         For bigging the bucht sae nar the road,
         Let the Lochinvar to me!
    217N.9   Shes tane her pig and her cog in her hand,
         And shes gane to milk the kye;
         But ere she was aware, the Laird o Lochinvar
         Cam riding in the way.
    217N.10  O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may!
         I wish ye may be sound;
         O save thee, O save thee, my bonnie may!
         What maks thy belly sae round?
    217N.11  O she has turnd hersel round about,
         And she within her thoucht shame:
         O its nabodys wills wi me, kind sir,
         For I hae a gudeman o my ain.
    217N.12  Ye lee, ye lee, my bonnie may,
         Weel do I ken ye lee!
         For dinna ye mind o the three gowd rings
         I gied ye o the new moneye?
    217N.13  O weel do I mind thee, kind sir,
         O weel do I mind thee;
         For ae when ye spak ye lifted up your hat,
         And ye had a bonnie twinklin ee.
    217N.14  O ye need na toil yoursel, my dear,
         Neither to card nor to spin;
         For theres ten pieces I gie unto thee;
         Keep them for your lying in.
    217N.15  Now she has hame to her father gane,
         As fast as she could hie;
         And she was na weel crownd wi joy
         Till her auld son gat she.
    217N.16  But shell na tell the daddie o it
         Till father not to mither,
         And shell na tell the daddie o it
         To sister nor to brither.
    217N.17  And word is to the Lochinvar,
         And word is to him gane,
         That sic a tenants dochter
         Has born a bastard son:
    217N.18  And shell na tell the daddie o it
         To father nor to mither,
         And shell na tell the daddie o it
         Till sister nor to brither.
    217N.19  O weel do I ken the reason o that,
         And the reason weel do I ken;
         O weel ken I the reason o that;
         Its to some o her fathers men.
    217N.20  But I will awa to Littlejohns house,
         Shule them out o the door;
         For theres na tenant on a my land
         Shall harbour an arrant hure.
    217N.21  Then out and spak the house-keeper,
         Yed better lat her abee;
         For an onie harm befa this may,
         A the wyte will be on me.
    217N.22  O he has turnd himsel round about,
         Within himsel thoucht he
         Better do I loe her little finger
         Than a thy haill bodie.
    217N.23  Gae saddle to me my six coach-mares,
         Put a their harness on,
         And I will awa to Littlejohns house
         For reports o this bastard son.
    217N.24  Now whan he cam to Littlejohns house,
         Littlejohn was at the door:
         Ye rascal, ye rogue, ye impudent dog,
         Will ye harbour an arrant hure!
    217N.25  O pardon me, my sovereign liege,
         O pardon me, I pray;
         Oh that the nicht that she was born
         Shed deed the very neist day!
    217N.26  But he is in to his bonnie lassie gane,
         And has bolted the door behind,
         And there he has kissd his bonnie lassie sweet,
         Its over and over again.
    217N.27  Ye did weel, ye did weel, my bonnie may,
         To keep the secret twixt me and thee;
         For I am the laird o the Ochilberry swair,
         The lady o t Ill mak thee.
    217N.28  Come doun, come duun, now gentlemen a,
         And set this fair lady on;
         Mither, ye may milk the ewes as ye will,
         For shell neer milk them again.
    217N.29  For I am the laird o the Ochilberry swair,
         O thirty plows and three,
         And I hae gotten the bonniest may
         Thats in a the south countrie.
