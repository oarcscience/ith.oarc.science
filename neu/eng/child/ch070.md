# 70A: Willie and Lady Maisry


    70A.1   WILLIE was a widows son,
        And he wore a milk-white weed, O
        And weel could Willie read and write,
        Far better ride on steed. O
    70A.2   Lady Margerie was the first lady
        That drank to him the wine,
        And aye as the healths gade round and round,
        Laddy, your love is mine.
    70A.3   Lady Margerie was the first ladye
        That drank to him the beer,
        And aye as the healths gade round and round,
        Laddy, youre welcome here.
    70A.4   You must come into my bower
        When the evening bells do ring,
        And you must come into my bower
        When the evening mass doth sing.
    70A.5   Hes taen four and twenty braid arrows,
        And laced them in a whang,
        And hes awa to Lady Margeries bower,
        As fast as he can gang.
    70A.6   He set ae foot on the wall,
        And the other on a stane,
        And hes killed a the kings life-guards,
        And hes killed them every man.
    70A.7   Oh open, open, Lady Margerie,
        Open and let me in;
        The weet weets a my yellow hair,
        And the dew draps on my chin.
    70A.8   With her feet as white as sleet
        She strode her bower within,
        And with her fingers long and small
        Shes looten Sweet Willie in.
    70A.9   Shes louten down unto her foot
        To loose Sweet Willies shoon;
        The buckles were sa stiff they wudna lowse,
        The blood had frozen in.
    70A.10  O Willie, Willie, I fear that thou
        Has bred me dule and sorrow;
        The deed that thou has dune this nicht
        Will kythe upon the morrow.
    70A.11  In then came her father dear,
        And a broad sword by his gare,
        And hes gien Willie, the widows son,
        A deep wound and a sair.
    70A.12  Lye yont, lye yont, Willie, she says,
        Your sweat weets a my side;
        Lye yont, lie yont, Willie, she says,
        For your sweat I downa bide.
    70A.13  She turned her back unto the wa,
        Her face unto the room,
        And there she saw her auld father,
        Walking up and down.
    70A.14  Woe be to you, father, she said,
        And an ill deed may you die!
        For yeve killd Willie, the widows son
        And he would have married me.
    70A.15  She turned her back unto the room,
        Her face unto the wa,
        And with a deep and heavy sich
        Her heart it brak in twa.

### 70B: Willie and Lady Maisry


    70B.1   SWEET WILLIE was a widows son,
        And milk-white was his weed;
        It sets him weel to bridle a horse,
        And better to saddle a steed, my dear,
        And better to saddle a steed.
    70B.2   But he is on to Maisrys bower-door,
        And tirled at the pin:
        Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Lady Maisry,
        Yell open, let me come in.
    70B.3   O who is this at my bower-door,
        Sae well that knows my name?
        It is your ain true-love, Willie,
        If ye love me, lat me in.
    70B.4   Then huly, huly raise she up,
        For fear o making din,
        Then in her arms lang and bent,
        She caught sweet Willie in.
    70B.5   She leand her low down to her toe,
        To loose her true-loves sheen,
        But cauld, cauld were the draps o bleed
        Fell fae his trusty brand.
    70B.6   What frightfu sight is that, my love?
        A frightfu sight to see!
        What bluid is this on your sharp brand?
        O may ye not tell me?
    70B.7   As I came thro the woods this night,
        The wolf maist worried me;
        O shoud I slain the wolf, Maisry?
        Or shoud the wolf slain me?
    70B.8   They hadna kissd, nor love clapped,
        As lovers when they meet,
        Till up it starts her auld father,
        Out o his drowsy sleep.
    70B.9   O whats become o my house-cock,
        Sae crouse at ane did craw?
        I wonder as much at my bold watch,
        Thats nae shooting ower the wa.
    70B.10  My gude house-cock, my only son,
        Heir ower my land sae free,
        If ony ruffian hae him slain,
        High hanged shall he be.
    70B.11  Then hes on to Maisrys bower-door,
        And tirled at the pin:
        Ye sleep ye, wake ye, daughter Maisry,
        Yell open, lat me come in.
    70B.12  Between the curtains and the wa
        She rowd her true-love then,
        And huly went she to the door,
        And let her father in.
    70B.13  Whats become o your maries, Maisry,
        Your bower it looks sae teem?
        Whats become o your green claithing,
        Your beds they are sae thin?
    70B.14  Gude forgie you, father, she said,
        I wish ye bet for sin;
        Sae aft as ye hae dreaded me,
        But never found me wrang.
    70B.15  He turnd him right and round about,
        As hed been gaun awa;
        But sae nimbly as he slippet in
        Behind a screen sae sma.
    70B.16  Maisry, thinking a dangers past,
        She to her love did say,
        Come, love, and take your silent rest;
        My auld fathers away.
    70B.17  Then baith lockd in each others arms,
        They fell full fast asleep,
        When up it starts her auld father,
        And stood at their bed-feet.
    70B.18  I think I hae the villain now
        That my dear son did slay;
        But I shall be revengd on him
        Before I see the day.
    70B.19  Then hes drawn out a trusty brand,
        And stroakd it oer a stray,
        And thro and thro Sweet Willies middle
        Hes gart cauld iron gae.
    70B.20  Then up it wakend Lady Maisry,
        Out o her drowsy sleep,
        And when she saw her true-love slain,
        She straight began to weep.
    70B.21  O gude forgie you now, father, she said,
        I wish ye bet for sin;
        For I never lovd a love but ane,
        In my arms yeve him slain.
    70B.22  This night hes slain my gude bold watch,
        Thirty stout men and twa;
        Likewise hes slain your ae brother,
        To me was worth them a.
    70B.23  If he has slain my ae brither,
        Himsell had a the blame,
        For mony a day he plots contrivd,
        To hae Sweet Willie slain.
    70B.24  And tho hes slain your gude bold watch,
        He might hae been forgien;
        They came on him in armour bright,
        When he was but alane.
    70B.25  Nae meen was made for this young knight,
        In bower where he lay slain,
        But a was for sweet Maisry bright,
        In fields where she ran brain.
