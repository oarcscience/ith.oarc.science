# 248A: The Grey Cock, or, Saw You My Father


    248A.1   O SAW ye my father? or saw ye my mother?
         Or saw ye my true-love John?
         I saw not your father, I saw not your mother,
         But I saw your true-love John.
    248A.2   Its now ten at night, and the stars gie nae light,
         And the bells they ring ding, dang;
         Hes met wi some delay that causeth him to stay,
         But he will be here ere lang.
    248A.3   The surly auld earl did naething but snarl,
         And Johnys face it grew red;
         Yet, tho he often sighd, he neer a word replied
         Till all were asleep in bed.
    248A.4   Up Johny rose, and to the door he goes,
         And gently tirl d the pin;
         The lassie taking tent unto the door she went,
         And she opend and let him in.
    248A.5   And are ye come at last? and do I hold ye fast?
         And is my Johny true?
         I hae nae time to tell, but sae langs I like mysell
         Sae lang will I love you.
    248A.6   Flee, flee up, my bonny grey cock,
         And craw when it is day;
         Your neck shall be like the bonny beaten gold,
         And your wings of the silver grey.
    248A.7   The cock provd false, and untrue he was,
         For he crew an hour oer soon;
         The lassie thought it was day when she sent her love away,
         And it was but a blink of the moon.
