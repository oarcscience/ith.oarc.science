### How the Golden Girdle was awarded to the False Florimell

Then each Knight in turn began to claim the golden girdle on behalf of
his own lady. First, Cambell brought to their view his fair wife,
Cambina, covered with a veil. The veil being withdrawn at once revealed
her surpassing loveliness, which stole all wavering hearts. Next, Sir
Triamond uncovered the face of his

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

dear Candace, which shone with such beauty that the eyes of all were
dazzled as with a great light. After her, Paridell produced his false
Duessa. With her forged beauty, Duessa entrapped the hearts of some who
considered her the fairest; and, after these, a hundred more ladies
appeared in turn, each one of whom seemed to excel the others.

At last Britomart openly showed her lovely Amoret, whose face uncovered
seemed like the heavenly picture of some bright angel. Then all who saw
her thought that Amoret would surely bear away the prize.

But Blandamour, who imagined that he had the real, true Florimell, now
displayed the Snowy Lady, and the sight, once seen, dismayed all the
rest.

For all who had seemed bright and fair before, now appeared base and
contemptible; compared with her, they were only like stars in comparison
with the sun. Every one who saw her was ravished with wonder; they
thought she could be no mortal, but must be some celestial being. They
were all glad to see Florimell, yet thought Florimell was not so fair as
this lady. Like some base metal overlaid with gold, which deceives those
who see it, was this false image who passed for the true Florimell. Thus
do forged things sometimes show the fairest.

Then, by the decision of all, the golden belt was granted to her as to
the fairest lady; and, bringing it to her, they thought to place it
round her waist, as became her best. But this they could by no means do,
for every time they fastened the girdle, it grew loose and fell away, as
if there were some secret fault in her.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Again and again she put it round her waist, but
again and again it fell apart. All the people wondered at the strange
sight, and each one thought according to

<span id="img_24100"></span>

his own fancy. But the Snowy Lady herself thought it was some spiteful
trick, and it filled her with wrath, and shame as a thing devised to
bring disgrace on her.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

Then many other ladies likewise tried to put on the girdle, but it would
stay on none of them. As soon as they thought it fast, immediately it
was untied again.

Seeing this, a scornful knight began to just and sneer, saying it was a
pity that, among so many beautiful ladies, not one was found worthy to
wear the girdle. All the knights began to laugh and all the ladies to
frown, till at last the gentle Amoret also essayed to prove the girdle's
power. She set it round her waist, and immediately it fitted perfectly,
with no difficulty whatever.

The others were very envious, and the Snowy Lady was greatly fretted.
Snatching the belt angrily from Amoret, she again tied it round her own
body, but none the more would it fit her.

Nevertheless, to her, as her due right, was the girdle yielded, for
every one thought she was the true Florimell, to whom it really
belonged. And now she had to choose her companion knight. Then she
adjudged the prize to the "Knight of the Ebony Spear," who had won it in
fight. But Britomart would not assent to this, nor give up her own
companion, Amoret, for the sake of that strange lady, whose wondrous
beauty she esteemed less than the wisdom and goodness of Amoret.

When the other knights saw Britomart refuse, they were all very glad,
for each hoped Florimell would choose himself. But the judges said that
after Britomart she must next choose the second best, and that was the
"Savage Knight." But Sir Artegall had already left in displeasure
because he had not won the

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

prize. Then she was offered Triamond, but Triamond loved Candace, and no
one else. Then Sir Satyrane was adjudged to Florimell, and he was right
glad to gain so goodly an award; but Paridell and Blandamour and many
other knights were very angry, and wanted to fight Sir Satyrane. The
hideous old woman, Até, with her wicked words, stirred them all up to
demand and challenge Florimell as their right, the recompense which they
deserved for their peril.

Amongst the rest, with boastful, vain pretence, Braggadochio stepped
forward and claimed her as his thrall, having won her in battle long
ago. He called the Snowy Lady herself to witness this, and being asked,
she confessed that it was the case.

Thereupon all the other knights were more angry than ever, and they were
quite ready to prepare anew for battle. But Sir Satyrane hit on a plan
to appease them. He suggested that the Lady herself should choose which
knight she preferred, and all the others should abide by her choice.
This they agreed to. So Florimell was placed in the midst of them all,
and every knight hoped she would choose him. Then, having looked a long
time at each one, as though she wished to please them all, the Snowy
Lady walked up to Braggadochio, and the two went off together.

Britomart took no part in the struggle for Florimell, for as soon as she
saw that discord had arisen, she left the place. Taking with her the
lovely Amoret, who was still looking for Sir Scudamour, Britomart rode
off on her first quest, to seek her beloved Knight, Sir Artegall, whose
image she had seen in the magic mirror.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Little did she know that he was the "Savage
Knight" with whom she had so lately fought, and who was even now waiting
to be revenged on her. Unlucky maid, to seek her enemy! Unlucky maid to
seek far and wide for him whom, when he was nearest, she could not
discover because of his disguise!
