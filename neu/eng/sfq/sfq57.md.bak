# The Squire of Low Degree

### The Giant with Flaming Eyes

BRITOMART, the Warrior Princess, having rescued the fair lady Amoret
from the wicked Enchanter, then started forth with her to find her
husband, the good Knight Scudamour. Riding through a forest, they
alighted to rest, and here Britomart, overcome with weariness, lay down
to sleep.

Amoret, meanwhile, fearing nothing, roamed at pleasure through the wood.
Suddenly from behind, some one rushed out, who snatched her up and bore
her away. This was a huge, hideous savage, who killed and ate all the
beautiful maidens he could get hold of. He carried Amoret fainting in
his arms, right through the forest, till he came to his dwelling, a
horrible cave, far from all people's hearing. Into this he flung her,
and went off to see if he could secure any other victims.

Amoret was roused by her fall, but when she looked

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

about and found nothing around her but darkness and horror, she almost
fainted again, and did not know whether she were above or under the
ground. Then she heard some one close by sighing and sobbing, and found
this was another beautiful lady whom the savage had taken prisoner.

Amoret asked her who she was, and the lady told her sad story.

She said her name was Emilia; she was the daughter of a great lord, and
everything went joyously with her till she happened to fall in love with
a gentle youth, a Squire in her father's household. He was gallant and
worthy enough for any lady to love, but he was not of noble birth like
herself, and her father refused to let her marry him, and was angry with
her for her folly. Nothing, however, would make her alter her mind, and
rather than forsake her faithful Amyas she resolved to leave friends and
family, and fly with him. A meeting-place in the wood was arranged, to
which she came, but there, instead of her gallant Squire, she found the
savage monster, who pounced on her like an eagle, and carried her to his
cave.

While Emilia and Amoret were talking of their troubles, the hideous
villain who was the cause of them came rushing back, rolling away the
stone which he used to stop the entrance, in order that no one might go
out. Directly he entered, Amoret slipped past him, and escaped from the
cave with a loud scream of horror. Fast she fled, but he followed as
swiftly. She did not feel the thorns and thickets prick her tender feet;
neither hedge, nor ditch, nor hill, nor

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

dale could stop her; she overleaped them all like a deer, and made her
way through the thickest brushwood. And whenever she looked back with
anxious eyes and saw the grisly monster approaching, she quickened her
pace, spurred on by fear.

Long she fled thus, and long he followed, and it seemed as if there were
no living aid for her on earth. But it chanced that the glorious
Huntress-Queen, Belphœbe, with her companions the wood-nymphs, were that
day chasing the leopards and the bears in that wild forest. A gentle
squire, who was also one of the party, got separated from the others,
and he came in sight of Amoret just as she was overtaken by the savage,
who carried her away under his arm, grinning, and yelling with laughter.

The squire immediately attacked the savage, but it was difficult to do
him any harm, for the latter held Amoret all the while as a shield, and
the squire was afraid of hurting her. But at last he did succeed in
wounding the wretch, who then flung Amoret rudely on the ground, and
flew at the squire so fiercely that he forced him back.

In the midst of their battle, Belphœbe drew near. The robber, seeing her
approach with bow in hand and arrows ready bent, would no longer stay to
fight, but fled away in ghastly fear, for he knew she was the only one
who could kill him. But fast as he flew, Belphœbe kept pace with him,
and before he reached his den she sent forth an arrow with mighty force
which caught him in the very doorway and slew him.

Amoret and Emilia were now safe, and they lived

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

together in the wood for some time; but both were very ill--Emilia from
having been kept so long a prisoner in the cave, where she was nearly
starved, and Amoret from the hurts she had received in the rough
handling of the savage.

One day it chanced that through this wood rode Prince Arthur, and he
came to the place where the two ladies dwelt. He was greatly grieved to
see the sad state in which they were, especially Amoret, who looked as
if she could not live long. He immediately drew forth some of that
precious liquor which he always kept about him, and which had the power
of healing all wounds. It was the same wonderful medicine that he had
long ago given to the Red Cross Knight, when he rescued him from the
dungeon of Giant Pride. Prince Arthur sprinkled a few drops of this on
Amoret's wounds, and she soon recovered her strength.

When the ladies were well, Prince Arthur began to ask what evil guide
had brought them there, and how their harms befell. They told him all
that had happened, and how they had been released from thraldom by the
beautiful Belphœbe. Then the Prince said he would restore them safely to
their friends, and placing them both on his war-horse, he went beside
them himself on foot, to shield them from fear.

Thus, when they had passed out of the forest they spied far away a
little cottage, to which they came before nightfall. But entering, they
found no one dwelling there, except one old woman who sat upon the
ground in tattered raiment, her dirty locks scattered all about her,
while she gnawed her nails with cruelty

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

and rage. She was a hideous creature to see, and no less hateful by
nature, for she was stuffed full with rancour and spite, which often
broke forth in streams of poison, bitterness, and falsehood against all
who held to truth or virtue. Men called her name *Slander*.

It was Slander's nature to abuse all goodness, and continually to invent
crimes of which to accuse guiltless people, so that she might steal away
their fair name. No knight was ever so bold, nor any lady so good and
loyal, but what Slander strove to defame them falsely; never thing was
done so well but she would blot it with blame, and deprive it of due
praise. Her words were not, as common words are meant, to express the
meaning of the mind, but they were sharp and. bitter to pierce the heart
and grieve the soul; like the stings of asps that kill with their bite,
her spiteful words pricked and wounded inwardly.

Such was the hag, unfit to receive these guests, whom the greatest
Prince's court would have been glad to welcome; but their necessity bade
them look for no better entertainment. It was, besides, an age which
despised luxury. People were accustomed to hardness and homely fare,
which trained them to warlike discipline, and to endure carelessly any
hard fortunes or luckless mishaps which might befall them.

All that evening, then, welcomed with cold and cheerless hunger, they
spent together, and found no fault, except that the hag scolded and
railed at them for lodging there without her consent. But they mildly
and patiently endured it all, regardless of the unjust blame and bitter
reviling of such a worthless creature.

Directly it was daylight they prepared again for their journey, and went
forth, Amoret and Emilia as before riding on the horse, and the Prince
walking beside them. As soon as they departed, wicked old Slander
followed, reviling them, and calling them bad names. The more they were
vexed at this, the worse she raged and railed; and even when they had
passed cut of sight and hearing she did not stop her spiteful speeches,
but railed anew against the stones and trees, until she had dulled the
sting that grew in the end of her tongue.

As the travellers went slowly on their way, they saw galloping towards
them, as if in flight, a Squire who bore before him on his steed a
little dwarf, shrieking loudly for help. They were pursued by a mighty
man, riding on a dromedary, huge of stature, and horrible to behold.
From his terrible eyes came two fiery beams, sharper than needles'
points, which had the power of working deadly poison to all who looked
on him without good heed, and of secretly slaying his enemies. All the
way he raged at the Squire, and hurled threats at him, but the latter
fled so fast he could not overtake him. Seeing the Prince in his bright
armour, the Squire called to him to pity him and rescue him from his
cruel foe.

Then Prince Arthur at once took down the two ladies from his war-horse,
and mounting in their place came to the Squire. In another moment the
Giant was upon them. He aimed a furious blow at the Squire, which would
certainly have killed him, had not the noble Prince defeated the stroke
by thrusting

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

forward, and meeting it on his own shield. It fell with such force that
it drove the shield aside, and knocked both the Squire and the dwarf to
the ground. Then Prince Arthur, enraged, smote at the Pagan with all his
might and main, and killed him.

When the Squire saw his foe dead he was indeed glad, but the dwarf
howled aloud to see his lord slain, and tore his hair, and scratched his
face for grief.

Then the Prince began to inquire about everything that had happened, and
who he was whose eyes flamed with fire. And all this the Squire then
told him:--
