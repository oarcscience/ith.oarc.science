### The Giant with the Scales

After travelling a long, weary way, Sir Artegall and Talus came near the
sea, and here one day they saw before them an immense crowd of people,
stretching out as far as the eye could reach. They were much astonished
at this great assembly, and therefore approached to ask what had brought
them together. There they beheld a mighty giant standing on a rock,

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

and holding high in his hand a great pair of scales, with which he
boasted in his presumption that he

[![](tn/29100.jpg)

would accurately weigh the whole world, if he had anything to match it
in the other scale. He said he

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

would take up all the earth, and all the sea, divided from each other;
so would he also make one balance of the fire, and one of air, without
wind or weather; then he would balance heaven and hell together, and all
that was contained within them, and would not miss a feather of their
weight-any surplus of each that remained over he would restore to its
own part, For, said he, they were all unequal, and had encroached on
each other's share, like the sea which had worn the earth, as the fire
had done the air. So all the rest took possession of each other's parts,
and thus countries and nations had gone awry. All of which he undertook
to repair in the way they had anciently been formed, and everything
should be made equal. He would throw down the mountains and make them
level with the plain; the towering rocks he would thrust down into the
deepest sea; he would suppress tyrants, so that they should no longer
rule; and all the wealth of the rich men he would take away and give to
the poor.

All the silly ignorant folk flocked about the giant, and clustered thick
to hear his vain delusions, like foolish flies round a jar of honey; for
they hoped to gain great benefits by him, and uncontrolled freedom. When
Artegall saw and heard how he misled the simple people, he disdainfully
drew near, and thus spoke to him without fear:--

"You that presume to weigh the world anew, and restore all things to an
equality, it seems to me show great wrong instead of right, and boast
far more than you are able to perform." And then he went on to

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

rebuke the giant for his folly and presumption, and showed him that if
he could not understand nor weigh properly even the things that he saw,
how much less could he attempt to balance unseen matters, or call into
account the works of the great Ruler of the universe.

But the giant would not listen to reason, for he had no real desire for
the right, and he still tried to continue his false and wicked teaching.
Talus, therefore, seeing his mischievous ignorance, came up, and toppled
him over into the sea, where he fell with a great splash and was
drowned.

When the people who had long waited there saw his sudden destruction,
they began to gather in a turbulent mob, and tried to stir up strife,
because of the loss of all their expectations. For they had hoped to get
great good, and wonderful riches, by the giant's new schemes, and
resolving to revenge his death, they rose in arms, and stood in order of
battle.

When Artegall saw this lawless multitude advancing in hostile fashion,
he was much troubled, and did not know what to do; for he was loath to
soil his hands by killing such a rascally crew, and yet he feared to
retire, lest they should follow him with shame. Therefore he sent Talus
to them to inquire the cause of their array, and to request a truce. But
as soon as they saw him coming they began to attack him with their
weapons, and rudely struck at him on every side

yet they could not in the least hurt or dismay him. Then Talus lay about
him with his flail and overthrew them like a swarm of flies. Not one of
them dared

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

come in his way, but they flew here and there, and hid themselves out of
his sight in holes and bushes. When Talus saw that they all forsook the
field and none of the rascal rout were left, he returned to Sir
Artegall, and they went on together.
