### How it fared with Britomart in Castle Joyous

The stately mansion into which Britomart and the rescued Knight now
entered was called "Castle Joyous," and the owner of it was known to her
retainers by the name of "the Lady of Delight." It would be impossible
to tell all the wonderful richness and beauty of this building, which
was adorned fit for the palace of a prince.

Passing through a lofty and spacious chamber, every pillar of which was
pure gold, set with pearls and precious stones, the knights came to an
inner room, hung with the most costly tapestry. The place was filled
with the sweetest music and the singing of birds, but the wasteful
luxury they saw on every side did not please Britomart nor the Knight,
and they looked with a scornful eye on such lavish profusion.

Then they came into the presence of the Lady of the Castle. They found
her seated on a splendid couch, glittering with gold and embroidery. She
seemed very generous and of rare beauty, but she was neither gentle nor
modest, and she never hesitated to gratify her own desires at any cost.

When she saw Britomart, who, in her armour, appeared to be a young and
handsome knight, she took a great liking to her, and thought how nice it
would be if she would enter into her service, and stay altogether at the
Castle. All through the splendid supper which was presently served, she
tried to make herself as agreeable as ever she could, hoping that
Britomart would be tempted to remain. After supper, she begged her to
lay aside her armour, and enjoy some sport; but this the maiden refused
to do, for she wore it as a disguise. Britomart would not be so
discourteous as to repulse the kindly spoken offers of goodwill, but she
in her heart thought that such a sudden affection for a wandering guest
could not be worth very much.

When the supper-tables were cleared away, all the knights, and squires,
and dames began to make merry. There was dancing and gambling, and every
kind of revelry; but through it all Malecasta (which was the real name
of the Lady of Delight) was plotting in her own mind how she could get
hold of Britomart. If the gallant young Knight (as she thought him)
would not consent to stay of his own free will, she determined to detain
him by guile.

So that night, when Britomart had taken off her armour and was fast
asleep, Malecasta went to her room. Britomart sprang up in a great
fright, and ran to seize her weapon; but Malecasta shrieked for her six
knights, and they all came rushing in, armed and half-armed. When they
saw Britomart, with her sword drawn, they were afraid to go near her;
but,

one of them drew a deadly bow, and shot a keen arrow at her, which
wounded her in the side. But the noise had also wakened the other
Knight, who now ran to her help, and, fighting together side by side,
they soon defeated their foes.

When they were all put to shameful flight, Britomart arrayed herself
again in her armour, for she would stay no longer in a place where such
things were done by those who were apparently noble knights and ladies.
Quite early, therefore, while the dawn was still grey, she and her
companion-knight took their steeds and went forth upon their journey.
