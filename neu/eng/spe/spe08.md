SKILL OF THE ENGLISH IN ARCHERY.--Among the arts that have been carried
to a high degree of perfection in this kingdom, there is no one more
conspicuous than that of Archery. Our ancestors used the bow for a
double purpose: in time of war, it was a dreadful instrument of
destruction; and in peace it became an object of amusement. It will be
needless to insist upon the skill of the English archers, or to dilate
upon their wonderful performances in the field of battle. The victories
they obtained over their enemies are many and glorious; they are their
best eulogiums, and stand upon record in the histories 'of this country
for the perusal, and for the admiration of posterity. I shall therefore
consider this subject in a general point of view, and confine myself, in
the main, to such parts of it as relate to amusement only.

\* Though the use of the bow for the projection of darts or arrows shows
some advance on the rudest forms of savage life, there can be no doubt
that it was in common use throughout the British Isles for many
centuries before the advent of the Romans. Vast numbers of flint arrow
heads have been found throughout England, particularly on the wolds of
Yorkshire and the moors of Derbyshire. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226.md)

THE BOW KNOWN TO THE ANGLO-SAXONS AND DANES.--The Anglo-Saxons, and the
Danes, were certainly well acquainted with the use of the bow; a
knowledge they derived at an early period from their progenitors. The
Scandinavian scalds, speaking in praise of the heroes of their country,
frequently add to the rest of their acquirements a superiority of skill
in handling of the bow. <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_227.md) Offrid,
son of Edwin, king of Northumberland, was killed by an arrow in a battle
which was fought near Hatfield, Yorkshire, about the year 633. Polydore

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Virgil says that a great number of archers were
placed in the right wing of King Alfred's army. Edmund, king of the East
Angles, was shot to death with arrows by the Danes.

FORM OF THE SAXON Bow.--Representations of the bow occur frequently in
the Saxon manuscripts; and from one of them in the Cotton Library,
written about the tenth century, <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_228.md) I
have selected two archers, who are figured on the fifth plate. The one
accompanied by his dog, is in search of the wild deer; the other has no
companion, but is depicted in the act of shooting at a bird; and from
the adornment of his girdle, appears to have been no bad marksman. The
first represents Esau going to seek venison for his father, and the
second, Ishmael, after his expulsion from the house of Abraham, and
residing in the desert.

This plate also contains a Saxon bow and arrow on a larger scale, taken
from the same manuscript. The bow is curiously ornamented, having the
head and tail of a serpent carved at the ends; and was, probably, such a
one as was used by the nobility. In all these bows we may observe one
thing remarkable, that is, the string not being made fast to the
extremities, but permitted to play at some distance from them. How far
this might be more or less advantageous than the present method, I shall
not presume to determine.

\* NORMAN ARCHERY.--Contrary to the assertions of Speed and certain
later historians, the bow was in well-established use in England at the
period of the Norman Conquest, though apparently at that time used by
them but little in warfare. There is only one English archer represented
on the historic Bayeux embroidery, whilst the credit of William's
victory was mainly due to the archers of Louviers and Evreux. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_229.md) Of the Conqueror it was recorded, as of
Ulysses, that no man could bend his bow. The Normans speedily
popularised the general use of a weapon, with which they were such
adepts, throughout England, both for the chase and amusement, as well as
for military purposes. Under Henry II. the use of the bow contributed
materially to the conquest of Ireland. Fitzstephen, who *baliste*, in
that reign, states that the London skaters moved faster than *telum*
wrote which seems to prove that the cross-bow was also in common use at
that period.

In the ages of chivalry the usage of the bow was considered as an
essential part of the education of a young man who wished to make a
figure in life. The heroes of romance are therefore usually praised for
their skill in archery; and Chaucer, with propriety, says of sir Thopas,
"He was a good archere."

ARCHERY PRACTISED BY LADIES.--The ladies were also fond of this
amusement, and by a previous representation on the second plate, from an
original drawing in a manuscript of the fourteenth century, we see it
practised by one who has shot at a deer, and wounded it with great
adroitness; and in another previous engraving ([plate five](#img_pl05).md)
the hunting equipments of the female archers about the middle of the
fifteenth century are represented.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

It was usual, when the ladies exercised the bow, for the beasts to be
confined by large inclosures, surrounded by the hunters, and driven in
succession from the covers to the stands, where the fair sportswomen
were placed; so that they might readily shoot at them, without the
trouble and fatigue of rousing and pursuing them. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_230.md) It is said of Margaret, the daughter of
Henry VII., that when she was on her way towards Scotland, a hunting
party was made for her amusement in Alnwick Park, where she killed a
buck with an arrow. <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_231.md) It is not
specified whether the long-bow or the cross-bow was used by the princess
upon this occasion; we are certain that the ladies occasionally shot
with both, for when queen Elizabeth visited lord Montecute at Cowdrey,
in Sussex, on the Monday, August 17, 1591, "Her highness tooke horse,
and rode into the park, at eight o'clock in the morning, where was a
delicate bowre prepared, under the which were her highness musicians
placed; and a cross-bow, by a nymph, with a sweet song, was delivered
into her hands, to shoote at the deere; about some thirty in number were
put into a paddock, of which number she killed three or four, and the
Countess of Kildare one." <span id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_232.md)

THE CROSS-Bow.--The arbalist, or cross-bow, which was much shorter than
the long-bow, fastened upon a stock, and discharged by the means of a
catch or trigger, which probably gave rise to the lock on the modern
musket. Bayle, explaining the difference between testimony and argument,
uses this simile, "Testimony is like the shot of a long-bow, which owes
its efficacy to the force of the shooter; argument is like the shot of a
cross-bow, equally forcible, whether discharged by a dwarf or a giant."

I cannot pretend to determine at what period the cross-bow was first
brought into this country, but I believe not long before the
commencement of the thirteenth century; at least, I have never met with
any representation of such an engine prior to that period. On the
continent its appearance might be somewhat earlier. Our historians
assure us that Richard I. was wounded by an arrow from a bow of this
kind, while he was reconnoitring the walls of the castle of Chalezun;
which wound was the occasion of his death. William Brito seems to
attribute the introduction of the cross-bow to this monarch, who, he
says, first showed it to the French. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[4](#fn_233.md)

In the twenty-third year of the reign of Edward I. the Earl of Warwick
had in his army a number of soldiers called *ballistari*, and this word
is translated cross-bow men by our chronological writers, but certainly
it may with equal propriety be rendered slingers, or casters of stones,
who frequently formed a part of the Anglo-Norman armies. <span
id="fr_234"></span>[5](#fn_234.md)

In 1341 an order was issued by Edward III. to the sheriffs of most of
the English counties to supply five hundred white bows and five hundred
bundles of arrows, ready for the war against France. In the two
following years like

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

orders were repeated, save that the sheriff of Gloucestershire was
instructed to provide five hundred painted bows as well as five hundred
white or unpainted, the latter being sixpence cheaper than the former.
The painting of these long-bows was intended either to make them smarter
for military use, or to increase their duration. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_235.md)

From this period we hear but little concerning the cross-bows, as
military weapons, until the battle of Cressy in 1346; at which time they
were used by a large body of Genoese soldiers, who were particularly
expert in the management of these weapons, and assisted the French upon
that memorable occasion; but their efforts were ineffectual when opposed
to the archery of the English. Previous to the commencement of the
battle there fell a sharp shower of rain, which wetted the strings of
the cross-bows; and, we are told, in great measure prevented the archers
from doing their usual execution; <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_236.md)
but the strings of the long-bows used by the Englishmen do not appear to
have been damaged in the least by the rain; this might arise from their
being made with different materials; or more probably, from their being
kept with the bows, in the bow-cases, during the continuance of the
shower; for every man had a case of canvass, or of some such material,
to draw over his bow when he had done using of it. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_237.md)

In the succeeding annals the cross-bow is continually spoken of as a
weapon of war. In 1347, the year after the celebrated victory was
obtained at Cressy, Charles, earl of Blois, at the siege of le Roche de
Rien, had no less than two thousand cross-bowmen in his army. The
cross-bow was used by the English soldiery chiefly at sieges of
fortified places, and on shipboard, in battles upon the sea. But the
great fame acquired by our countrymen in archery, was derived from their
practice with the long-bow: and to this instrument they gave the
preference.

FORM AND USE OF THE CROSS-BOW.--The reader may see the manner in which
the cross-bow was formerly used for fowling purposes upon the sixth
plate. The representation given at the bottom is taken from a manuscript
of the fourteenth century in the Royal Library. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[4](#fn_238.md)

In the centre is an illustration, from a painting on another manuscript
in the Royal Library, much more modern. <span
id="fr_239"></span>[5](#fn_239.md) We find here exhibited a school for
practice; and the manner in which the archers shot at the butts, or dead
marks, a pastime frequently alluded to by the authors of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries.

At the end of the reign of Henry VII. the cross-bow was forbidden by law
to be used by any man, except by the King's license, unless he was a
lord or had two hundred marks in land. To still further favour the use
of the long-bow it was at the same time provided that no custom should
be paid on good bow-staves

brought into the realm. <span id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_240.md) In 1514 a
much more severe statute was passed, whereby any one keeping a cross-bow
in his house, unless he had land to the yearly value of three hundred
marks, was to forfeit; and the great penalty of £10 to was imposed for
every time a cross-bow was used for shooting. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_241.md) This Act was renewed and further
strengthened in 1533. <span id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_242.md) This severe
fine might probably produce a temporary reformation; which certainly was
not of long continuance, for cross-bows were commonly used again in the
succeeding reigns. Hentzner tells us, that in the year 1598, he saw in
the armory of the Tower of London, cross-bows, and bows and arrows: of
which, says he, to this day, the English make great use in their
exercises. Stow speaks of a large close, called the Tazell, let in his
time to the cross-bow makers, wherein, he says, they used to shoot for
games at the popinjay, which, Maitland tells us, was an artificial
parrot. <span id="fr_243"></span>[4](#fn_243.md)

Bows AND ARROWS ORDERED TO BE KEPT.--To return to the long-bow: As far
back as the thirteenth century, every person not having a greater annual
revenue in land than one hundred pence, was obliged to have in his
possession a bow and arrows, with other arms offensive and defensive;
and all such as had no possessions, but could afford to purchase arms,
were commanded to have a bow with sharp arrows, if they dwelt without
the royal forests, and a bow with round-headed arrows, if they resided
within the forests. The words of the statute are, "arcs e setes hors de
forestes, e dedenz forestes arcs e pilets." <span
id="fr_244"></span>[5](#fn_244.md) The word *pilet* I believe is derived
from the Latin, *pila*, a ball; and I suppose these arrows were used to
prevent the owners from killing the king's deer. The round-headed arrows
were also called bolts, and also used with the cross-bow; hence the old
adage, "A fool's bolt is soon shot," where the retort of an ignorant man
is compared to the blunted arrow of an unskilful archer, shot off
hastily, and without any aim. The proverb is thus versified by John
Heywood,

A fooles bolte is soone shot, and fleeth oftymes fer  
But the fooles bolte, and the marke, cum few times ner. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[6](#fn_245.md)

It was also ordained by the forementioned statute that proper officers
should be appointed to see that these weapons were kept in good order,
and ready for immediate service.

DECAY OF ARCHERY.--Notwithstanding the manifest advantages accruing to
the nation from the practice of archery, it seems to have been much
neglected even at a time when the glory of the English archers was in
its zenith, I mean in the reign of Edward III.; which occasioned that
monarch to send a letter of complaint upon this subject to the sheriffs
of London, declaring that the skill in shooting with arrows was almost
totally laid aside, for the pursuit of various useless and unlawful
games. He therefore commanded them to prevent such idle practices within
the city and liberties of London; and to see that the leisure

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

time upon holidays was spent in recreations with bows and arrows. In the
thirty-ninth year of this reign, A.D. 1349, the penalty incurred by the
offenders was imprisonment at the king's pleasure; the words of the
letter are, "arcubus et sagittis vel pilettis aut boltis," with bow and
arrows, or piles or bolts. The same command was repeated in the twelfth
year of the reign of Richard II.; but probably its good effects were
merely temporary. And in the fifth year of Edward IV. an ordinance was
made, commanding every Englishman and Irish-man dwelling in England, to
have a long-bow of his own height; the act directs, that butts should be
made in every township, at which the inhabitants were to shoot at up and
down, upon all feast days, under the penalty of one halfpenny for every
time they omitted to perform this exercise. This in the poetical legends
is called "shooting about."

\* Suitable wood for bows became so scarce in England, owing mainly to
the long continued wars with France, that in 1436 Nicholas Hisham,
merchant of York, had license to sail to Prussia with four ships in
quest of wood for bows and spears. In 1472 it was enacted that all
merchant strangers sending goods to England in any vessel or ship of
Venice, or of any other city, town, or country whence bow-staves have
been imported, were to send four bow-staves for every ton of merchandise
thus imported. <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_246.md)

In the sixteenth century we meet with frequent complaints respecting the
disuse of the long-bow, and especially in the vicinity of London. Stow
informs us, "that before his time it had been customary at Bartholomew
tide, for the lord mayor, with the sheriffs and aldermen, to go into the
fields at Finsbury, where the citizens were assembled, and shoot at the
standard, with broad and flight arrows, for games." This exercise was
continued for several days; but at the period in which our author lived
it was practised only one afternoon, three or four days after the
festival of Saint Bartholomew. <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_247.md)

The same writer attributes the decay of archery among the Londoners to
the enclosures made near the metropolis, by which means the citizens
were deprived of room sufficient or proper for the purpose; and his
observations appear to have been justly founded, for a few years
posterior to his death, a commission was granted by James I., in 1612,
to many persons of quality; in which were recited and established the
good statutes, ordinances, and proclamations, that had been previously
made at different times in favour of archery. This commission extended
to the prevention of enclosures in the grounds formerly used for the
practice of the bow.

The commissioners were also impowered to survey the lands adjoining to
the city of London, its suburbs, and within two miles circuit; and to
reduce them to the same state and order for the use of the archers, as
they stood at the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII.; and where they
found any encroachments, to cause the banks to be thrown down, the
ditches filled up, and the open

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

spaces to be made level. Charles I. confirmed this commission, or
granted another to the same purpose.

ORDINANCES IN FAVOUR OF ARCHERY.--CROSS-BOWS, &c.--In the reign of Henry
VIII. three several acts were made for promoting the practice of
shooting with the long-bow; one, as we have already seen, prohibited the
use of cross-bows and hand-guns: another was occasioned by a complaint
from the bowyers, the fletchers, or arrow-makers, the stringers, and the
arrow-head-makers, stating that many unlawful games were practised in
the open fields, to the detriment of the public morals, and great decay
of archery. Those games were therefore strictly prohibited by
parliament; and a third act followed, which obliged every man, being the
king's subject, to exercise himself in shooting with the long-bow; and
also to keep a bow with arrows continually in his house. From this
obligation were excepted such as were sixty years old, or by lameness or
by any other reasonable impediment claimed an exemption; and also all
ecclesiastics, the justices of the two benches, or of the assizes, and
the barons of the exchequer. Fathers and guardians were also commanded
to teach the male children the use of the long-bow, and to have at all
times bows provided for them as soon as they arrived at the age of seven
years; and masters were ordered to find bows for their apprentices, and
to compel them to learn to shoot with them upon holidays, and at every
other convenient time. By virtue of the same act, every man who kept a
cross-bow in his house was liable to a penalty of ten pounds.

Soon afterwards, that is, in the twenty-ninth year of the same king's
reign, the use of cross-bows under certain restrictions was permitted, a
patent being then granted by him to sir Christopher Morris, master of
his ordinance, Anthony Knevyt and Peter Mewtas, gentlemen of his privy
chamber, for them to be overseers of the science of artillery, by which
was meant long-bows, cross-bows, and hand-guns. Others were appointed to
be masters and rulers of the same science, with power to them and their
successors, to establish a perpetual corporation, called the Fraternity
of Saint George, and to admit such persons as they found to be eligible.
The members of this society were also permitted, for pastime sake, to
practise shooting at all sorts of marks and butts, and at the game of
the popinjay, and other games, as at fowls and the like, in the city and
suburbs of London, as well as in any other convenient places. There is
the following remarkable proviso in this charter; "In case any person
should be wounded, or slain in these sports, with an arrow shot by one
or other of the archers, he that shot the arrow was not to be sued or
molested, if he had, immediately before the discharge of the weapon,
cried out, 'fast,' the signal usually given upon such occasions." <span
id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md)

\* HENRY VIII. AN ARCHER.--Henry VIII. not only took the greatest
interest in promoting archery, but was himself a remarkable expert in
the use of

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

the bow. His prowess before Francis at the Field of the Cloth of Gold
has often been recorded, when if we are to give credit to the loyal
chroniclers, "he repeatedly shot into the centre of the white, though
the marks were erected at the extraordinary distance of twelve score
yards apart." Cavendish, the historian of Cardinal Wolsey, when he bore
the news of Wolsey's death to the king at Hampton Court, in 1530, "found
him shooting at the rounds in the park, on the backside of the garden.
And perceiving him occupied in shooting, thought it not my duty to
trouble him. . . . 'I will,' quoth he, 'make an end of my game, and then
I will talk with you,' and so departed to his mark, whereat the game was
ended. Then the king delivered his bow unto the yeoman of his bows, and
went his way inward to the palace, when I followed."

\* The privy purse expenses of Henry VIII. prove his great attachment to
archery when in the prime of life. The following occur in the years
1530-1:--

\* Latimer enforced his royal patron's keenness for archery from the
pulpit, when preaching before the king, and received £5 from the privy
purse for his pains.

"The art of shooting hath been in times past much esteemed in this
realme; it is a gift of God, that he hath gyven us to excell all other
nations withal--It hath been Goddes instrumente whereby he hath gyven

In the reverence of God, let it be continued. Let a proclimacion go

\* In the great inventory of arms and armour at Westminster, the Tower,
and Greenwich, taken in 1547, the long-bows at the Tower numbered 3060,
with "13,050 sheife of livery arrowes"; at Westminster were "twoo Longe
Bowes of Ewghe to shote stones"; and at Greenwich eighty four long bows
of various kinds. There were also at the Tower eight boxes containing
eighty gross of bow-strings. <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_250.md)

PRICES ORDAINED FOR Bows.--In the reign of Edward IV. an ordinance was
established, which compelled the bowyers of London to sell the best
bow-staves at three shillings and fourpence each; which was confirmed in
the third year of Henry VII., and in the thirty-third year of his son
Henry VIII.; but these acts were repealed in the third year of queen
Mary, and the following prices were settled by the parliament: for a bow
made of the best foreign yew, six shillings and eightpence; for an
inferior sort, three shillings and fourpence; and for one made of
English yew, two shillings. <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_251.md)

\* Sir Thomas Elyot's delightful book "The Governour," first issued in
1531, contains the earliest printed account of English archery; chapter
xxvii. is devoted to the praise of the long-bow. It was not, however,
until 1545 that a whole treatise was published on this subject.

\* In that year Ascham's treatise, entitled "Toxophilus, the Schole of
Shootinge, conteyned in two bookes," was first published. It was "newlye
perused"

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

and reprinted in 1571; and again in 1589 and in 1591. There have been
numerous later reprints.

EQUIPMENT FOR ARCHERY.--Ascham informs us, that it was necessary for the
archer to have a bracer, or close sleeve, to lace upon the left arm; it
was also proper for this bracer to be made with materials sufficiently
rigid to prevent any folds which might impede the bow-string when loosed
from the hand; to this was to be added a shooting-glove, for the
protection of the fingers. The bow, he tells us, ought to be made with
well-seasoned wood, and formed with great exactness, tapering from the
middle towards each end. Bows were sometimes made of Brazil, of elm, of
ash, and of several other woods; but eugh, or yew, had the sanction,
from general experience, of superiority. Respecting the bow-string, the
author was not decided which to prefer; those made with good hemp,
according to the common usage of the time in which he lived, or those
manufactured with flax, or silk; he therefore thinks the choice ought to
be left to the string-maker. There are, he tells us, three essential
parts in the composition of the arrow, that is to say, the stele or
wand, the feathers, and the head. The stele was not always made with the
same species of wood, but varied as occasion required, to suit the
different manners of shooting practised by the archers; he commends
sound ash for military arrows, and preferred it to asp, which in his day
was generally used for the arrows belonging to the army; but for
pastime, he thought that none were better than those made of oak,
hard-beam, or birch; but after all, says he, in this point I hold it
best to trust to the recommendation of an honest fletcher. The feathers
from the wing of a goose, and especially of a grey-goose, he thought
were preferable to any others for the pluming of an arrow. Thus in the
popular ballad of Chevy Chace, an English archer aimed his arrow at sir
Hugh Mountgomerye, with such skill, that it hit him on the breast, and
the poet elegantly says,

The grey-goose-winge that was thereon  
In his hearts blood was wett.

\[paragraph continues\] The more ancient ballad upon this subject, given
in the first volume of the *Reliques of Ancient Poetry*, reads, the
"swane-feathers."

There was, it seems, but little difference between the two wings of one
bird; but, according to the opinion of the best arrow-makers, the second
feather was best in some cases and the pinion in others. It was
necessary for an archer to have several arrows of one flight (I presume
Ascham means of one shape, length, and weight), plumed with feathers
from different wings, to suit the diversity of the winds. We are not
from these directions to conclude, that the goose alone afforded the
plumage for the arrows; the feathers of many other birds were used for
the same purpose, and are mentioned in the metrical romances of the
middle ages. An old ballad of Robin Hood says, that he and his followers
had an hundred bows furnished with strings, and an hundred sheafs of
goose arrows, with bright burnished heads; every arrow was an ell long,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

adorned with peacocks' feathers, and bound at the notching with white
silk. <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252.md)

With them they had an hundred bowes,  
The stringes were well ydight;  
An hundred shefe of arrows good  
With hedes burnish’d full bryght;  
And every arrowe an ell longe,  
With peacocke well ydight,  
And nocked they were with white silk,  
It was a semely syght.

And Chaucer, in his description of the "squyers yeoman," says,

And he was clad in cote and hode of grene,  
A shefe of pecocke arrowes bryght and shene;  
Under his belt he bare ful thriftely  
Well coude he dresse his tackle yomanly;  
His arrowes drouped not with fethers lowe,  
And in hande he bare a myghty bowe. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253.md)

The adornment of these arrows with peacocks' feathers is not to be
considered as a mere poetical flourish, for we have sufficient
testimony, that such plumage was actually used. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_254.md)

But, returning to our author, he informs us, that the English arrows had
forked heads and broad-heads, yet he thought, that round pointed heads
resembling a bodkin were the best. The notch, or small hollow part at
the bottom of the arrow, made for the reception of the bow-string, was
varied as occasion required, or at the will of the archer, being
sometimes deep and narrow, and sometimes broad and not deep.

DIRECTIONS FOR ARCHERY.--Having thus furnished the archer with his
necessary accoutrements, Ascham proceeds to instruct him how they ought
to be managed; but first of all he recommends a graceful attitude. He
should stand, says another writer, fairly, and upright with his body,
his left foot at a convenient distance before his right; holding the bow
by the middle, with his left arm stretched out, and with the three first
fingers and the thumb of the right hand upon the lower part of the arrow
affixed to the string of the bow. <span id="fr_255"></span>[4](#fn_255.md)
In the second place, a proper attention was to be paid to the nocking,
that is, the application of the notch at the bottom of the arrow to the
bow-string; we are told that the notch of the arrow should rest between
the fore-finger and the middle finger of the right hand. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[5](#fn_256.md) Thirdly, our attention is directed to
the proper manner of drawing the bow-string: in ancient times, says
Ascham, the right hand was brought to the right pap; but at present it
is elevated to the right ear, and the latter method he prefers to the
former. The shaft of the arrow below the feathers, ought to be rested
upon the knuckle of the fore-finger

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

of the left hand; the arrow was to be drawn to the head, and not held
too long in that situation, but neatly and smartly discharged, without
any hanging upon the string. Among the requisites necessary to
constitute a good archer, are a clear sight, steadily directed to the
mark; and proper judgment, to determine the distance of the ground; he
ought also to know how to take the advantage of a side wind, and to be
well acquainted with what compass his arrows would require in their
flight: courage is also an indispensable requisite, for whoever, says
our author, shoots with the least trepidation, he is sure to shoot
badly. One great fault in particular he complains of, which young
archers generally fall into, and that is, the direction of the eye to
the end of the arrow, rather than to the mark; to obviate this evil
habit he advises such, as were so accustomed, to shoot in the dark, by
night, at lights set up at a proper distance for that purpose. He then
concludes with observing, that "bad tutorage" was rarely amended in
grown-up persons; and therefore he held it essentially necessary, that
great attention should be paid to the teaching an archer properly, while
he was young; "for children," says he, "if sufficient pains are taken
with them at the onset, may much more easily be taught to shoot well,
than men," because the latter have frequently more trouble to unlearn
their bad habits, than was primitively requisite to learn them good
ones. <span id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_257.md)

MARKS FOR SHOOTING.--The marks usually shot at by the archers for
pastime, were, "butts, prickes, and roavers." The butt, we are told, was
a level mark, and required a strong arrow, with a very broad feather;
the pricke was a "mark of compass," but certain in its distance; and to
this mark strong swift arrows, of one flight, with a middling sized
feather, were best suited; the roaver was a mark of uncertain length; it
was therefore proper for the archer to have various kinds of arrows, of
different weights, to be used according to the different changements
made in the distance of the ground.

The Cornish men are spoken of as good archers, and shot their arrows to
a great length; they are also, says Carew, "well skilled in near
shooting, and in well aimed shooting;--the butts made them perfect in
the one, and the roaving in the other, for the prickes, the first
corrupters of archery, through too much preciseness, were formerly
scarcely known, and little practised." <span
id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_258.md) Other marks are occasionally mentioned,
as the standard, the target, hazel wands, rose garlands, and the
popinjay, which, we are told, was an artificial parrot. I have not met
with such a mark in any manuscript delineation; but, in the presentment
on plate six, the reader will find a cock substituted for the parrot,
and the archer has discharged his arrow very skilfully. I am by no means
certain, whether the draughtsman designed to represent an artificial, or
a living cock: the manner of its being placed on the post, may favour
the first idea; but the mouth being open, and the elevation of the head,
as if in the last gasp of life, will justify the latter. It is taken
from a MS. written early in the fourteenth century, preserved in the
Royal Library. <span id="fr_259"></span>[3](#fn_259.md)

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

LENGTH OF Bows AND ARROWS.--The length of the bow is not clearly
ascertained; those used by the soldiery appear, in the manuscript
drawings, to have been as tall, at least, as the bearers; agreeable to
an ordinance made in the fifth year of Edward IV. commanding every man
to have a bow his own height; and they might, upon the average, be
something short of six feet long. The arrows used by the English archers
at the memorable battle of Agincourt, were a full yard in length. Carew,
in his survey of Cornwall, says, "The Cornish archers for long shooting,
used arrows a cloth yard long." The old and more modern ballads of Chevy
Chace speak of the arrow as being the length of a cloth yard, but some
of these poetical legends extend it an ell.

Hall mentions a company of archers, who met king Henry VIII. at
Shooter's Hill, on a May-day morning, where they discharged their bows
in his presence, and the arrows made a loud whistling in their flight,
"by crafte of the heade." <span id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_260.md) The
strangeness of the noise, we are informed, surprised his Majesty, though
at the same time he was much pleased with the contrivance. A modern
author, the Hon. Daines Barrington, assures us, this sound was
occasioned by holes being made in the arrow heads, and that such weapons
were used upon military occasions, and especially as signals; <span
id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_261.md) but not, I presume, before the time
mentioned by the historian; for had not those arrows been newly
introduced, there is no reason why the king, who was well acquainted
with every branch of archery, should have been surprised at the sound
they made, or pleased at the sight of them.

FEATS IN ARCHERY.--If the metrical romances and ballads of the former
ages may be depended upon, the strength of our English archers in
drawing of the bow, and their skill in directing the arrow to its mark,
were justly the objects of admiration.

The reader, I trust, will pardon the insertion of the following extracts
from two old poetical legends, which convey, at least, some idea of the
practice of archery in times anterior to our own; the first is a ballad
in eight fyttes or parts, entitled, "A mery Geste of Robyn Hode." <span
id="fr_262"></span>[3](#fn_262.md) According to the story, the king <span
id="fr_263"></span>[4](#fn_263.md) thought proper to pay Robin Hood a
visit, disguised in the habit of an abbot: and the outlaw, by way of
entertaining his guest, proposed a shooting match. Two wands were then
set up, but at so great a distance from each other, that,

By fyfty space our kyng sayde  
The markes were to longe.--  
On every syde a rose garlande,  
The shot under the lyne.  
Whoso faileth of the rose garland, said Robyn,  
His takyll he shal tyne; <span id="fr_264"></span>[5](#fn_264.md)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

And yelde it to his maister,  
Be it never so fine.--  
Twyse Robyn shot about,  
And ever he cleved the wande.--

\[paragraph continues\] And so did Gilbert, Little John, and
Scathelocke, his companions; but,

At the last shot, that Robyn shot,  
For all his frendes fore,  
Yet he fayled of the garland,  
Three fyngers and more--

of course his "takill" was forfeited, which he presented to the king,
saying,

Syr abbot, I deliver thee myne arowe.

The second poem is also of the ballad kind, and apparently as old as the
former, <span id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) wherein Adam Bell, Clym of
the Cloughe, and William Cloudesle, are introduced to shoot before the
king. The butts, or dead marks set up by the king's archers, were
censured by Cloudesle, saying,

I hold hym never no good archer,  
That shoteth at buttes so wide--

and having procured two "hasell roddes," he set them up at the distance
of twenty score paces from each other; his first attempt in shooting at
them, contrary to the expectation of the king, was successful, for it is
said,

Cloudesle with a bearyng arowe  
Clave the wand in two.

\[paragraph continues\] The king, being much surprised at the
performance, told him he was the best archer he ever saw. Cloudesle then
proposed to show him a more extraordinary proof of his skill, and tied
his eldest son, a child only seven years old, to a stake, and placed an
apple upon his head. When he bound his son he charged him not to move,
and turned his face from him, that he might not be intimidated by seeing
the arrow directed towards him: six score paces were measured from the
stake, and Cloudesle went to the end of the measurement; he first
entreated the spectators to be silent,

And then drew out a fayre brode arrowe;  
  Hys bow was great and longe,  
He set that arrowe in his Bowe  
  That was both styffe and stronge.

Then Cloudesle cleft the apple in two,  
  As many a man myght se,  
Over Gods forbode, sayde the kynge,  
  That thou sholde shote at me.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

SUPERIORITY OF ANCIENT BOWMEN.--If we were to judge of the merits of the
ancient bowmen from the practice of archery as it is exercised in the
present day, these poetical eulogiums would appear to be entirely
fictitious. There are no such distances now assigned for the marks as
are mentioned before, nor such precision, even at short lengths, in the
direction of the arrows. By an act established An. 33 Hen. VIII., no
person who had reached the age of twenty-four years, might shoot at any
mark at less than two hundred and twenty yards distance. <span
id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) I believe few, if any, of the modern
archers, in shooting at a mark, exceed the distance of eighty or a
hundred yards, or, in long shooting, reach four hundred yards. I have
seen the gentlemen who practise archery in the vicinity of London,
repeatedly shoot from end to end, and not touch the target with an
arrow; and for the space of several hours, without lodging one in the
circle of gold, about six inches diameter in the centre of the target:
this, indeed, is so seldom done, that one is led to think, when it
happens, it is rather the effect of chance than of skill: which proves
what Ascham has asserted, that an archer should be well taught early in
life, and confirm the good teaching by continual practice afterwards. We
may also recollect, that archery is now followed for amusement only, and
is to be commended as a manly and gentleman-like exercise.

I remember about four or five years back, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_267.md) at a meeting of the society of archers,
in their ground near Bedford Square, the Turkish ambassador paid them a
visit; and complained that the enclosure was by no means sufficiently
extensive for a long shot: he therefore went into the adjacent fields to
show his dexterity; where I saw him shoot several arrows more than
double the length of the archery ground, and his longest shot fell
upwards of four hundred and eighty yards from his standing. The bow he
used was much shorter than those belonging to the English archers; and
his arrows were of the bolt kind, with round heads made of wood. This
distance rather exceeds the length our rhymist has given to the wands
set up by Cloudesle and his companions, but then we are to recollect
they shot with vast precision to that distance, which the ambassador did
not, he had no mark, and his arrows fell exceedingly wide of each
other. <span id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_268.md)

Carew, speaking of the Cornish archers three centuries back, says, "For
long shooting, their shaft was a cloth yard in length, and their prickes
twenty-four score paces, equal to four hundred and eighty yards; and for
strength, they would pierce any ordinary armour"; he then adds, "and one
Robert Arundell, whom I well knew, could shoot twelve score paces with
his right hand, with his left, and from behind his head." <span
id="fr_269"></span>[4](#fn_269.md)

\* Very few archers, with strong bows and light arrows, can now cover
more than three hundred yards. To attain this rare„e a bow of at least
sixty-two pounds must not only be used but mastered, <span
id="fr_270"></span>[5](#fn_270.md)

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH.--Henry VIII., having appointed a great match of
archery at Windsor, a citizen of London, named Barlow, an inhabitant of
Shoreditch, joined the archers, and surpassed them all in skill; the
king was so much pleased with his performance, that he jocosely gave him
the title of "Duke of Shoreditch"; and this title the captain of the
London archers retained for a considerable time afterwards. In 1583, in
the reign of Elizabeth, a grand shooting match was held in London, and
the captain of the archers assuming his title of Duke of Shoreditch,
summoned a suit of nominal nobility, under the titles of marquis of
Barlo, of Clerkenwell, of Islington, of Hoxton, of Shacklewell, and earl
of Pancrass, etc., and these meeting together at the appointed time,
with their different companies, proceeded in a pompous march from
Merchant Taylors Hall, consisting of three thousand archers, sumptuously
apparelled; every man had a long-bow, and four arrows. With the marquis
of Barlo and the marquis of Clerkenwell were "Hunters who wound their
horns." <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_271.md) Nine hundred and forty-two
of the archers had chains of gold about their necks. This splendid
company was guarded by four thousand whifflers and billmen, besides
pages and footmen. They passed through Broad-street, the residence of
their captain, and thence into Moorfields, by Finsbury, and so on to
Smithfield, where, having performed several evolutions, they shot at a
target for honour. <span id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_272.md)

ROYAL SPORT--A GOOD ARCHER WHY CALLED ARTHUR.--Kings and princes have
been celebrated for their skill in archery, and among those of our own
country may be placed king Henry VII., who in his youth was partial to
this exercise, and therefore it is said of him in an old poem, written
in praise of the princess Elizabeth, afterwards queen to Henry
VII. <span id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_273.md)

See where he shoteth at the butts,  
And with hym are lordes three;  
He weareth a gowne of velvette blacke,  
And it is coted above the knee.

\[paragraph continues\] He also amused himself with the bow after he had
obtained the crown, as we find from an account of his
expenditures, <span id="fr_274"></span>[4](#fn_274.md) where the following
memorandums occur: "Lost to my lord Morging at buttes, six shillings and
eightpence:" and again, "Paid to sir Edward Boroughe thirteen shillings
and fourpence, which the kynge lost at buttes with his cross-bowe." Both
the sons of king Henry followed his example, and were excellent archers;
and especially the eldest, prince Arthur, who used frequently to visit
the society of London bowmen at Mile-end, where they usually met, and
practised with them. From his expertness in handling of the bow, every
good shooter was called by his name. The captain also of the fraternity
was honoured with the title of Prince Arthur, and

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

the other archers were styled his knights. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[1](#fn_275.md) The title of Prince Arthur seems to have
been superseded by the creation of the "Duke of Shoreditch."

After the death of prince Arthur, his brother Henry continued to honour
the meeting at Mile-end with his presence. His exceeding fondness for
archery has already been described. Hall says that at the time of his
accession Henry VIII. "shotte as strong and as greate a lengthe as any
of his garde."

\* ARCHERY AT BUXTON.--In Elizabeth's reign archery was warmly
recommended as a healthy pastime. Of all the exercises that Dr Jones,
the Buxton physician in Elizabethan days, recommended to his patients,
archery was the favourite. "Shootinge at Garden Buttes too them whome it
agreeth and pleaseth, in place of Noblest exercyse standeth, and that
rather wythe Longe bowe, than with Tyller, Stone bowe, or Cross bowe.
Albeeit, to them that otherwyse cannot, by reason of greefe,
feeblenesse, or lacke of use, they may bee allowed. This practise of all
other the manlyest leaveth no part of the body unexercised, the breaste,
backe, reynes, wast, and armes, withdrawing the thyghes and legges with
running or going." <span id="fr_276"></span>[2](#fn_276.md)

\* ELIZABETHAN ARCHERS.--The county musters of the first year of
Elizabeth prove that the country at large was then exceedingly well
furnished with duly equipped archers. The return for Derbyshire, made on
March 9th, 1559, shows that that comparatively small county put into the
field, as "able footemen," 292 archers as against 918 billmen. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[3](#fn_277.md) During this reign, however, archery was
slowly but surely made to give way to musketry. From the muster
certificate of Derbyshire, in November 1587, it appears that out of 400
foot pressed for immediate service, 160 were "for shot," 160 were
billmen, and 80 archers; whilst out of 1300 able men selected for
further service, only 200 were "for bowes." <span
id="fr_278"></span>[4](#fn_278.md) It therefore follows that the proportion
of archers had been reduced in thirty years from a third to a fifth.

\* In some counties the change in these thirty years was greater than in
Derbyshire. In 1587-8, out of 1170 men under training in Lancashire, 700
bore light muskets and but 80 bows; whilst in Cheshire, out of a total
of 2189, there were only 80 archers. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[5](#fn_279.md) Within a few years after the Armada, the
old national weapon of the long-bow became nearly extinct. Nevertheless
it lingered longer in England than on the continent; a foreigner
visiting the Tower in 1598, expressed his surprise at finding bows in
the arsenals. In the more remote counties, an archer's equipment
lingered on, as the armour of the parish soldier occasionally supplied
for the musters, not only to the end of Elizabeth's reign, but even into
that of the first two Stuarts.

\* ARCHERY IN THE CIVIL WAR.--It has usually been said that the last
instance of the serious use of bows in Great Britain, and that to a very
partial extent, was in the guerilla warfare carried on against Cromwell
in remote parts of the Scottish Highlands. The Derbyshire records,
however, supply an

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

\[paragraph continues\] English instance; one James Wintone was "wounded
in ye righte hande by an arowe," in a skirmish at Hathersage in 1647, as
alleged in his claim for a pension. This was clearly a bow used by the
Royalists, for Wintone appealed to the Parliamentarians for a pension.
It is scarcely reasonable to suppose that this wounding by an arrow in
the Peak district was a solitary instance of the use of the bow;
probably many of the country gentlemen's houses were defended with these
weapons. <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280.md)

\* REVIVAL AT THE RESTORATION.--No sooner was the Restoration of the
monarchy accomplished than a determined effort was made, particularly in
London, to restore England's fame in archery.

\* On March 21st, 1661, four hundred archers made "a splendid and
glorious show" in Hyde Park, with Sir Gilbert Talbot as their colonel,
and Sir Edward Hungerford their lieutenant-colonel. "Several of the
Archers Shot near Twenty score yards within the compass of a Hat with
their Crossbows; and many of them, to the amazement of the Spectators
hit the mark; there were likewise three Showers of Whistling Arrows. So
great was the delight, and so pleasing the Exercise, that three
Regiments of Foot laid down their Arms to come and see it." In 1675,
three hundred and fifty richly-habited archers marched through the city
to compliment Sir Robert Vyner, the Lord Mayor, who entertained them at
dinner. In the following year upwards of a thousand archers were
reviewed by the king at Tuttlefields. The archers marched from London to
Hampton Court in July 1681, when the king watched them shooting for £30
worth of plate at eight score yards. A manuscript postscript to the copy
of the Bowman's Glory in the British Museum names a march through the
city of a thousand archers on April 21st, 1682, to Tuttlefields, where
the king again watched their manœuvres, including the "Three Showers of
Whistling Arrows." <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_281.md)

\* A dull poem, published in 1676, makes the following appeal in favour
of the revival of archery as a pastime:--

"Forsake your lov’d Olympian games awhile,  
With which the tedious minutes you beguile,  
Wave quoits and nine-pins, those bear-garden sports,  
And follow shooting, often used at courts." <span
id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_282.md)

\* SIR WILLIAM WOOD.--"Sir" William Wood, the famous archer, and author
of The Bowman's Glory, who died in 1691, at the age of 82, had the
following epitaph erected to his memory on the south side of the church
of St James, Clerkenwell; his title was a jocular suffix, like that of
the Duke of Shoreditch:--

"Sir William Wood lies very near this stone  
In’s time of archery excelled by none;  
Few were his equalls, and this noble art  
Hath suffer’d now in the most tender part. <span id="page_57">p.
57</span>  
Long did he live the honour of the bow,  
And his long life to that alone did owe;  
But how can art secure, or what can save  
Extreme old age from an appointed grave?  
Surviving archers much his loss lament,  
And in respect bestow’d this monument,  
Where whistling arrows did his worth proclaim,  
And eternize his memory and name." <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_283.md)

\* Wood was buried with archers' honours, three flights of whistling
arrow: being discharged over his grave.

\* In 1696, Elizabeth Shakerley, a widow lady, left by her will
thirty-five pounds to be distributed in prizes to the Artillery Company.

\* The Artillery Company originally confined to archers, as founded by
Henry VIII. and patronised by successive monarchs, were wont to practise
ir. Finsbury Fields, and hence were commonly known as the Finsbury
Archers, There are a variety of printed tracts and manuscripts extant
relative to the archers' marks in these fields, which were used by them
for upwards of two centuries. The earliest of these was printed and sold
at the sign of the Swan in Grub Street, by T. Sergeant, in 1594. The
full title is:--"Ayme for Finsburie Archers, or an alphabeticall table
of the names of every marke within the same fields, with their true (or
due) distances, both by the map and dimensuration of the line, published
for the ease of the skillfull and behoofe of the younge beginners in the
famed exercise of Archerie." <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_284.md)

\* No point of archery, from a military or sporting point of view, was
more important than keeping the length. On this account roving or
ranging across the fields, and shooting at marks of varying and
unascertained distances was much preferred, in old-time archery, to
pricking or shooting at a given mark from a fixed and known distance.
With one of the last editions of the Finsbury Archers, issued in 1738, a
plan was given of these fields with all the marks entered by name. <span
id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_285.md) These marks were originally 164 in
number, and they varied in length from 73 yards to 265 yards. When Mr
Barrington contributed his paper on Archery to the Society of
Antiquaries in 1783, the fields from Peerless-pool to the
Rosemary-branch and for a considerable distance northward were studded
with roving marks. At that period, however, there were only twenty-one
of the original marks standing, but the Artillery Company still claimed
access to them and tried to insist on their maintenance and repair.

\* In 1782, the Artillery Company marched, on Accession Day, to Baumer
Fields, where they found the gate of a large field, wherein stood one of
their stone marks, locked and chained and guarded by four men. The
Company however forced the gate and marched across. In 1786 they marched
to Fins-bury Fields "to view their several stone marks" and removed
several obstructions. In the same year, on August 17th, the Company on
its march came to a

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

piece of ground lately enclosed with a brick wall by the proprietors of
a white-lead mill, "between the marks of Bob Peak and the Levant." The
work of demolition began, but the Company was induced to desist on one
of the partners of the mill assuring the commanding officer of the
battalion of their ignorance of the Company's rights in these fields and
their willingness to enter into any reasonable terms of accommodation."
One of the archer's division was then ordered to shoot an arrow over the
said inclosure, as an assertion of the Company's right; which having
been done, the battalion proceeded on its march to several of the other
marks." <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_286.md) But bricks and mortar
eventually gained the day along the whole line, and all the Finsbury
marks have disappeared for more than a century.

\* THE TOXOPHILITES.--In 1780 Sir Aston Lever and Mr Waring founded a
society called the Toxophilites, who met regularly at Leicester House
and shot at butts erected in the gardens. From that date onwards, with
varying degrees of enthusiasm, shooting at targets with the long bow has
been an accepted pastime for ladies and gentlemen. A special impetus was
given to archery associations in 1844.
