ANCIENT BOWLING--POEM ON BOWLING.--The pastime of bowling, whether
practised upon open greens or in bowling-alleys, was probably an
invention of the middle ages. I cannot by any means ascertain the time
of its introduction; but I have traced it back to the thirteenth
century. The earliest representation of a game played with bowls occurs
on [plate thirty](#img_pl30.md) from a manuscript of that century. <span
id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_748.md)

Here two small cones are placed upright at a distance from each other;
and the business of the players is evidently to bowl at them
alternately; the successful candidate being he who could lay his bowl
the nearest to the mark. The French, according to Cotgrave, had a
similar kind of game, called *carreau*, from a square stone which, says
he, "is laid in level with and at the end of a bowling-alley, and in the
midst thereof an upright point set as the mark whereat they bowl." At
the top of the same plate is a fourteenth century drawing from a
beautiful MS. Book of Prayers, in the possession of Mr Douce. It
represents two other bowlers; but they have no apparent object to play
at, unless the bowl cast by the first may be considered as such by the
second, and the game require him to strike it from its place.

Below these we see three persons engaged in the pastime of bowling; and
they have a small bowl, or jack, according to the modern practice, which
serves them as a mark for the direction of their bowls: the action of
the middle figure, whose bowl is supposed to be running towards the
jack, will not appear by any means extravagant to such as are accustomed
to visit the bowling-greens.

\* It is recorded of Lord Brooke, who was killed at the storming of
Lichfield, 1643, that "he used to be much resorted to by those of the
preciser sort, who had got a powerful hand over him; yet they would
allow him Christian libertie for his recreation. But being at bowles one
day, and following his cast with much eagernesse, he cryed, 'Rubbe,
rubbe, rubbe, rubbe, rubbe.' His chaplain (a very strict mann) runns
presently to him; and, in the hearing of diverse, 'O good my Lord, leave
that to God--you must leave that to God!' says he." <span

The following little poem, by William Stroad, which I found in "Justin

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Pagitt's Memorandum Book" (1633), one of the
Harleian manuscripts at the British Museum, <span
id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_750.md) expresses happily enough the turns and
chances of the game of bowls:

A PARALLEL BETWIXT BOWLING AND PREFERMENT

Preferment, like a game at boules,  
  To feede our hope bath divers play:  
Heere quick it runns, there soft it roules;  
  The betters make and thew the way  
On upper ground, so great allies  
  Doe many *cast* on their desire;  
Some up are thrust and forc’d to rise,  
  When those are stopt that would aspire.

Some, whose heate and zeal exceed,  
  Thrive well by *rubbs* that curb their haste,  
And some that languish in their speed  
  Are cherished by some favour's blaste;  
Some rest in other's *cutting out*  
  The fame by whom themselves are made;  
Some fetch a *compass* farr about,  
  And secretly the marke invade.

Some get by *knocks*, and so advance  
  Their fortune by a boysterous aime:  
And some, who have the sweetest chance,  
  Their en’mies *hit*, and win the game.  
The fairest *casts* are those that owe  
  No thanks to fortune's giddy sway;  
Such honest men good *bowlers* are  
  Whose own true *bias cutts* the way.

In the three delineations just represented, we may observe that the
players have only one bowl for each person; the modern bowlers have
usually three or four.

\* In 1511, when Henry VIII. confirmed previous laws against illegal
games in favour of archery, "bowls" occurs for the first time in the
Statute Book. The much severer statute of 1541 forbad every kind of
labourer, artisan, apprentice, or servant playing at bowls (among a
number of other games) "out of Christmas," and even in Christmas only
"in their master's houses or in their master's presence." It was further
provided that no manner of persons were to play bowls in open places out
of their gardens or orchards, under a penalty of 6s. 8d. Moreover, this
curious kind of class legislation enabled any nobleman, or any one
possessed of lands worth £100 a year, to obtain a license for bowl
playing in his own domain.

\* Henry VIII., who was devoted to every form of sport, added
bowling-alleys to Whitehall, and his privy purse expenses show that he
was in the habit of backing his prowess with bets. On January 29th,
1530, Mr Fitzwilliam, the treasurer, won £4:10s. of the king at bowls.
On April 19th, 1532, Lord Wiltshire and Lord Rocheford won of the king
and Mr Baynton £9 at the same

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

game, and £35:5s. a few days later. In the next month Lady Anne lost
£12:7:6 at bowls to the serjeant of the cellar.

BOWLING-GREENS FIRST MADE BY THE ENGLISH.--Bowling-greens are said to
have originated in England; and bowling upon them, in my memory (1800),
was a very popular amusement. In most country towns of any note they are
to be found, and some few are still remaining in the vicinity of the
metropolis; but none of them, I believe, are now so generally frequented
as they were accustomed to be formerly. <span
id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_751.md)

BOWLING-ALLEYS.--The inconveniency to which the open greens for bowling
were necessarily obnoxious, suggested, I presume, the idea of making
bowling-alleys, which, being covered over, might be used when the
weather would not permit the pursuit of the pastime abroad; and
therefore they were usually annexed to the residences of the opulent;
wherein if the ladies were not themselves performers, they certainly
countenanced the pastime by being spectators; hence the king of Hungary,
in an old poem entitled "The Squyer of Low Degree" (*circa* 1475), says
to his daughter, to amuse you in your garden

An hundredth knightes, truly tolde,  
Shall play with bowles in alayes colde.

Andrew Borde, in his *Dietarie of Helthe*, describing a nobleman's
mansion, supposes it not to be complete without "a bowling-alley."

\* Dr John Jones, the physician at Buxton in Elizabethan days,
recommended his patients to make use of "bowling in allayes, the weather
convenient, and the bowles fitte to such a game, as eyther in playne or
longe allayes, or in suche as have crankes with halfe bowles, whiche is
the fyner and gentler exercise." <span id="fr_753"></span>[2](#fn_752.md)
The reference to alleys and convenient weather is a reminder that the
term "bowling-alley" as then used did not necessarily mean a covered-in
place with a boarded floor, and might apply to a hedged-in turfed path
or narrow enclosure in a garden. Dr Jones's reference to "crankes" and
"halfe bowles" is not quite clear; but probably crank is used in the
sense of a twist or bias, and half-bowl to the flattened form of bowl,
slightly oblate on one side and prolate on the other. When the bowl
ceased to be spherical and assumed this flattened shape, a kind of
impetus termed "bias" was given to cause it to run obliquely. The term
was used in the sixteenth century; thus Shakespeare in the *Taming of
the Shrew*:--

Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,  
And not unluckily against the bias.

\* In the later Elizabethan days bowling-greens were a usual part of the
"lay-out" of the larger gardens.

Bowling, according to an author in the seventeenth century, is a pastime

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "in which a man shall find great art in choosing
out his ground, and preventing the winding, hanging, and many turning
advantages of the same, whether it be in open wilde places, or in close
allies; and for his sport, the chusing of the bowle is the greatest
cunning; your flat bowles being best for allies, your round byazed
bowles for open grounds of advantage, and your round bowles, like a
ball, for green swarthes that are plain and level." <span
id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_753.md)

\* GAMING AT BOWLS.--Charles Cotton's *Compleat Gamester*, first issued
in 1674, complains that bowling would be a much more commendable sport
than it is, save for "those swarms of Rooks which so pester
Bowling-greens, Bares, and Bowling-alleys . . . with cunning, betting,
crafty matching, and basely playing booty." He further remarks, with
some wit, that "A Bowling-green or Bowling-Ally is a place where three
things are thrown away besides the Bowls, viz. Time, Money, and Curses,
and the last ten for one. The best sport in it is the Gamesters, and he
enjoys it that looks on and betts nothing. It is a School of Wrangling,
and worse than the Schools; for here men will wrangle for a hair's
breadth, and make a stir where a straw would end the controversie."

\* CHARLES I. AND CHARLES II. FOND OF BOWLS.--Charles I. was much
attached to the game. He made a bowling-green at Spring Gardens, and
during his detention at Holdenby Palace, where the green was in bad
order, he was allowed to ride over to Lord Vaux's at Harrowden and Earl
Spencer's at Althorp, where there were good bowling-greens.

\* Pepys enters in his *Diary*, under date May 1st, 1661--"Up early and
baited at Petersfield, in the room which the King lay in lately at his
being there. Here very merry, and played with our wives at bowles."
Again, on July 26th, 1662, he writes--"This afternoon I went to
Westminster . . . and thence to White Hall garden and the Bowling-ally,
where lords and ladies are now at bowles, in brave condition."

\* The Count de Gramont in his *Memoirs* makes frequent mention of
visiting Tunbridge to play bowls, and of the devotion of Charles II. to
the game.

SUPPOSED ORIGIN OF BILLIARDS.--On the top of is the representation of a
very curious ancient pastime which seems to bear some analogy to
bowling.

Here the bowls, instead of being cast by the hand, are driven with a
battoon, or mace, through an arch, towards a mark at a distance from it;
and hence, I make no doubt, originated the game of billiards, which
formerly was played with a similar kind of arch and a mark called the
king, but placed upon the table instead of the ground. The improvement
by adding the table answered two good purposes; it precluded the
necessity for the player to kneel, or stoop exceedingly, when he struck
the bowl and accommodated the game to the limits of a chamber.

KAYLES.--Kayles, written also cayles and keiles, derived from the French
word *quilles*, was played with pins, and no doubt gave origin to the
modern

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

game of nine-pins; though primitively the kayle-pins do not appear to
have been confined to any certain number, as we may observe by referring
to plate thirty-one, where the pastime of kayles playing is twice
represented. In the one instance there are six pins and in the other
eight, and the form of the pins is somewhat different. One of them in
both cases is taller than the rest, and this, I presume, was the
king-pin; it is placed at the end to the left of the thrower upon the
middle of the plate, and between the four upright pins at the bottom.

The arrangement of the kayle-pins differs greatly from that of the
nine-pins, the latter being placed upon a square frame in three rows,
and the former in one row only. The two delineations here copied, from
fourteenth century manuscripts, represent that species of the game
called club-kayles, *jeux de quilles à baston*, so denominated from the
club or cudgel that was thrown at them. <span
id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_754.md)

CLOSH.--The game of cloish, or closh, mentioned frequently in the
ancient statutes, <span id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_755.md) seems to have
been the same as kayles, or at least exceedingly like it: cloish was
played with pins, which were thrown at with a bowl instead of a
truncheon, and probably differed only in name from the nine-pins of the
present time.

LOGGATS.--Loggats, I make no doubt, was a pastime analogous to kayles
and cloish, but played chiefly by boys and rustics, who substituted
bones for pins. "Loggats," says Sir Thomas Hanmer, one of the editors of
Shakespeare, "is the ancient name of a play or game, which is one of the
unlawful games enumerated in the thirty-third statute of Henry VIII.: it
is the same which is now called kittle-pins, in which the boys often
make use of bones instead of wooden pins, throwing at them with another
bone instead of bowling." Hence Shakespeare, in Hamlet, speaks thus:
"did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with
them?" And this game is evidently referred to in an old play, entitled
"The longer thou livest the more Fool thou art," published in the reign
of queen Elizabeth, <span id="fr_757"></span>[3](#fn_756.md) where a dunce
boasts of his skill

At skales, and the playing with a sheepes-joynte.

\[paragraph continues\] In skales, or kayles, the sheepes-joynte was
probably the bone used instead of a bowl.

NINE-PINS--SKITTLES.--The kayle-pins were afterwards called kettle, or
kittle-pins; and hence, by an easy corruption, skittle-pins, an
appellation well known in the present day. The game of skittles, as it
is now played, differs materially from that of nine-pins, though the
same number of pins are required in both. In performing the latter, the
player stands at a distance settled by mutual consent of the parties
concerned, and casts the bowl at the pins: the contest is, to beat them
all down in the fewest throws. In playing at skittles, there is a double
exertion; one by bowling, and the other by tipping: the first is
performed at a given distance, and the second standing close to the
frame

 

<span id="img_pl31"></span>

[![Kayles](tn/pl31.jpg)

Kayles  

 

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

upon which the pins are placed, and throwing the bowl through in the
midst of them; in both cases, the number of pins beaten down before the
return of the bowl, for it usually passes beyond the frame, are called
fair, and reckoned to the account of the player; but those that fall by
the coming back of the bowl are said to be foul, and of course not
counted. One chalk or score is reckoned for every fair pin; and the game
of skittles consists in obtaining thirty-one chalks precisely: less
loses, or at least gives the antagonist a chance of winning the game;
and more requires the player to go again for nine, which must also be
brought exactly, to secure himself.

The preceding quotation from Hanmer intimates that the kittle-pins were
sometimes made with bones; and this assertion is strengthened by the
language of a dramatic writer, the author of the *Merry Milk-maid of
Islington*, in 1680, who makes one of his characters speak thus to
another: "I'll cleave you from the skull to the twist, and make nine
skittles of thy bones."

DUTCH-PINS.--Dutch-pins is a pastime much resembling skittles; but the
pins are taller and slenderer, especially in the middle pin, which is
higher than the rest, and called the king-pin. The pins are nine in
number, and placed upon a frame in the manner of skittles; and the bowls
used by the performers are very large, but made of a light kind of wood.
The game consists of thirty-one scores precisely; and every player first
stands at a certain distance from the frame, and throws his bowl at the
pins, which is improperly enough called bowling; afterwards he
approaches the frame and makes his tipp by casting the bowl among the
pins, and the score towards the game is determined by the number of them
beaten down. If this pin be taken out singly, when the bowl is thrown
from a distance, the game is won; this instance excepted, it reckons for
no more than the other pins.

FOUR-CORNERS.--Is so called from four large pins which are placed singly
at each angle of a square frame. The players stand at a distance, which
may be varied by joint consent, and throw at the pins a large heavy
bowl, which sometimes weighs six or eight pounds. The excellency of the
game consists in beating them down by the fewest casts of the bowl.

HALF-BOWL.--Half-bowl is one of the "new imagined" games prohibited in
1477 in favour of archery, <span id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_757.md) and
received its denomination from being played with one half of a sphere of
wood. Half-bow is practised to this day (1800) in Hertfordshire, where
it is commonly called rolly-polly; and it is best performed upon the
floor of a room, especially if it be smooth and level. There are fifteen
small pins of a conical form required for this pastime; twelve of which
are placed at equal distances upon the circumference of a circle of
about two feet and a half diameter; one of the three remaining pins
occupies the centre; and the other two are placed without the circle at
the back part of it, and parallel with the bowling-place, but so as to
be in a line with the middle pin; forming a row of five pins, including
two of those upon the circumference. In

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

playing this game, the bowl, when delivered, must pass above the pins,
and round the end-pin, without the circle, before it beats any of them
down; if not, the cast is forfeited: and, owing to the great bias of the
bowl, this task is not very readily performed by such as have not made
themselves perfect by practice. The middle pin is distinguished by four
balls at the top; and, if thrown down, is reckoned for four towards the
game; the intermediate pin upon the circle, in the row of five, has
three balls, and is reckoned for three; the first pin without the circle
has two balls, and is counted for two; and the value of all the others
singly is but one. Thirty-one chalks complete the game; which he who
first obtains is the conqueror. If this number be exceeded, it is a
matter of no consequence: the game is equally won.

NINE-HOLES.--This is mentioned as a boyish game, played at the
commencement of the seventeenth century. I have not met with any
description of this pastime; but I apprehend it resembled a modern one
frequently practised at the outskirts of the metropolis; and said to
have been instituted, or more probably revived, about 1780, as a
succedaneum for skittles, when the magistrates caused the skittle
grounds in and near London to be levelled, and the frames removed. Hence
some say the game of nine-holes was called "Bubble the Justice," on the
supposition that it could not be set aside by the justices, because no
such pastime was named in the prohibitory statutes; others give this
denomination to a different game: the name by which it is now most
generally known is "Bumble-puppy"; and the vulgarity of the term is well
adapted to the company by whom it is usually practised. The game is
simply this: nine holes are made in a square board, and disposed in
three rows, three holes in each row, all of them at equal distances,
about twelve or fourteen inches apart; to every hole is affixed a
numeral, from one to nine, so placed as to form fifteen in every row.
The board, thus prepared, is fixed horizontally upon the ground, and
surrounded on three sides with a gentle acclivity. Every one of the
players being furnished with a certain number of small metal balls,
stands in his turn, by a mark made upon the ground, about five or six
feet from the board; at which he bowls the balls; and according to the
value of the figures belonging to the holes into which they roll, his
game is reckoned; and he who obtains the highest number is the winner.
Doctor Johnson confounds this pastime with that of kayles, and says, "it
is a kind of play still retained in Scotland, in which nine holes,
ranged in threes, are made in the ground, and an iron bullet rolled in
among them." <span id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_758.md)

I have formerly seen a pastime practised by schoolboys, called
nine-holes: it was played with marbles, which they bowled at a board,
set upright, resembling a bridge, with nine small arches, all of them
numbered; if the marble struck against the sides of the arches, it
became the property of the boy to whom the board belonged; but, if it
went through any one of them, the bowler claimed a number of marbles
equal to the number upon the arch it passed through.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

\* TROUL IN MADAME.--A game borrowed from the French, and not unlike our
modern bagatelle, only played without a cue or mace, called "Troul in
Madame," was popular amongst the well-to-do in Elizabethan times. It was
to some extent a precursor of nine-holes. In that curious little work,
*The Benefit of the Auncient Bathes of Buckstones*, "by John Jones,
Phisition at the King's Mede nigh Darby," published in 1572, occurs the
following passage as to the exercise of his patients:

"The Ladyes, Gentle Women, Wyves, and Maydes maye in one of the
Galleries walke: and if the weather bee not aggreeable too theire
expectacion, they may have in the ende of a Benche eleven holes made,
intoo the which to trowle premmetes, or bowles, of leade, bigge, little,
or meane, or also of Copper, Tynne, Woode, eyther vyolent or softe,
after their owne discretion, the pastyme *Troule in Madame* is termed.

"Lykewyse, men feeble the same may also practise in another Gallery of
the Newe Buyldinges, and this dothe not only strengthen the stomach and
upper parts above mydryfe or wast: but also the middle partes beneath
the sharp gristle and the extreme partes, as the handes and legges,
according to the wayght of the thing trouled, fast, soft, or meane."

JOHN BULL.--This is the name of a modern (1800) pastime, which may be
played in the open air, or in a room. A square flat stone, being laid
level on the surface of the ground, or let into the floor, is subdivided
into sixteen small squares; in every one of these compartments a number
is affixed, beginning from one; the next in value being five, the next
ten; thence passing on by tens to an hundred, and thence again, by
hundreds, to five hundred. These numbers are not placed regularly, but
contrasted, so that those of the smallest value are nearest to those of
the highest; and in some instances, as I am informed, the squares for
the greater numbers are made much smaller than those for the small ones.
On reaching five hundred a mark is made, at an optional distance from
the stone, for the players to stand; who, in succession, throw up one
halfpenny or more, and make their score according to the number assigned
to the compartment in which the halfpenny rests, which must be within
the square; for, if it lies upon one of the lines that divide it from
the others, the cast is forfeited, and nothing scored. Two thousand is
usually the game; but this number is extended or diminished at the
pleasure of the gamesters.

PITCH AND HUSTLE.--This is a game commonly played in the fields by the
lowest classes of the people. It requires two or more antagonists, who
pitch or cast an equal number of halfpence at a mark set up at a short
distance; and the owner of the nearest halfpenny claims the privilege to
hustle first; the next nearest halfpenny entitles the owner to a second
claim; and so on to as many as play. When they hustle, all the halfpence
pitched at the mark are thrown into a hat held by the player who claims
the first chance; after shaking them together, he turns the hat down
upon the ground; and as many of them as lie with the impression of the
head upwards belong to him; the remainder are then

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

put into the hat a second time, and the second claimant performs the
same kind of operation; and so it passes in succession to all the
players, or until all the halfpence appear with the heads upwards.
Sometimes they are put into the hands of the player, instead of a hat,
who shakes them, and casts them up into the air; but in both instances
the heads become his property: but if it should so happen, that, after
all of them have hustled, there remain some of the half-pence that have
not come with the heads uppermost, the first player then hustles again,
and the others in succession, until they do come so.

COCK-FIGHTING.--This barbarous pastime, which claims the sanction of
high antiquity, was practised at an early period by the Grecians, and
probably still more anciently in Asia. It is a very common sport, and of
very long standing, in China. <span id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_759.md) It
was practised by the Romans: <span id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_760.md) with
us, it may be traced back to the twelfth century; at which period we are
certain it was in usage; and seems to have been considered as a childish
sport. "Every year," says Fitzstephen, "on the morning of
Shrove-Tuesday, the school-boys of the city of London <span
id="fr_762"></span>[3](#fn_761.md) bring game cocks to their masters, and
in the fore part of the day, till dinner time, they are permitted to
amuse themselves with seeing them fight." Probably the same custom
prevailed in other cities and great towns. Stow having cited the
preceding passage from Fitzstephen, adds, "cocks of the game are yet,"
that is at the close of the sixteenth century, "cherished by divers men
for their pleasures, much money being laid on their heads when they
fight in pits, whereof some are costly made for that purpose." <span
id="fr_763"></span>[4](#fn_762.md) The cock-pit was the school, and the
master the controller and director of the pastime. This custom,
according to Mr. Brand, "was retained in many schools in Scotland within
the last century, and perhaps may be still in use there: the
schoolmasters claimed the runaway cocks as their perquisites; and these
were called fugees, 'corrupt, I suppose,' says he, 'of refugees.'" <span
id="fr_764"></span>[5](#fn_763.md)

In the reign of Edward III. cock-fighting became a fashionable
amusement; it was then taken up more seriously than it formerly had
been, and the practice extended to grown persons; even at that early
period it began to be productive of pernicious consequences, and was
therefore prohibited in 1366 by a public proclamation, in which it was
ranked with other idle and unlawful pastimes. But notwithstanding it was
thus degraded and discountenanced, it still maintained its popularity,
and in defiance of all temporary opposition has descended to the modern
times. Among the additions made by Henry VIII. to the palace at
Whitehall, was a cock-pit; <span id="fr_765"></span>[6](#fn_764.md) which
indicates his relish for the pastime of cock-fighting; and James I. was
so partial to this diversion, that he amused himself in seeing it twice
a week. <span id="fr_766"></span>[7](#fn_765.md)

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

\* Gervaise Martsham issued a tract in 1614, which treats of "The
Choice, Ordering, Breeding, and Dyeting of the Fighting Cocke;" he
considered that "there is no pleasure more noble, delightsome, or voyd
of couzenage and deceipt than this pleasure of cocking."

Exclusive of the royal cock-pit, we are told there was formerly one in
Drury Lane, another in Jewin Street, and if the following story be
founded on fact, a third in Shoe Lane: "Sir Thomas Jermin, meaning to
make himself merry, and gull all the cockers, sent his man to the pit in
Shoe Lane, with an hundred pounds and a dunghill cock, neatly cut and
trimmed for the battle; the plot being well layd the fellow got another
to throw the cock in, and fight him in Sir Thomas Jermin's name, while
he betted his hundred pounds against him the cock was matched, and
bearing Sir Thomas's name, had many betts layd upon his head; but after
three or four good brushes, he showed a payre of heeles: every one
wondered to see a cock belonging to Sir Thomas cry *craven*, and away
came the man with his money doubled." <span
id="fr_767"></span>[1](#fn_766.md)

I shall not expatiate upon the nature and extent of this fashionable
divertisement; but merely mention a part of it called the Welch main,
which seems to be an abuse of the modern times; and as a late judicious
author justly says, "a disgrace to us as Englishmen." <span
id="fr_768"></span>[2](#fn_767.md) It consists of a certain or given number
of pairs of cocks, suppose sixteen, which fight with each other until
one half of them are killed; the sixteen conquerors are pitted a second
time in like manner, and half are slain; the eight survivors, a third
time; the four, a fourth time; and the remaining two, a fifth time: so
that "thirty-one cocks are sure to be inhumanly murdered for the sport
and pleasure of the spectators." I am informed that the Welch main
usually consists of fourteen pairs of cocks, though sometimes the number
might be extended.

In the old illuminated manuscripts we frequently meet with paintings
representing cocks fighting; but I do not recollect to have seen in any
of them the least indication of artificial spurs; the arming their heels
with sharp points of steel is a cruelty, I trust, unknown in former ages
to our ancestors. I have been told the artificial spurs are sometimes
made with silver.

In addition to what has been said, I shall only observe, that the
ancients fought partridges and quails as well as cocks; in like manner
as the French do now (1800); how far, if at all, the example has been
followed in England, I know not.

\* After the fire of 1697, the old cock-pit of Whitehall was turned into
the Privy Council room. Treasury Papers of the following century are
often, curiously enough, headed "The Cock-pit."

\* Pepys has two entries in his *Diary* with reference to cocking; a
sport that attracted crowds in the days of "the merry monarch."

"21st December 1663.-To Shoe Lane, to see a cocke-fighting at a new

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

pit there, a spot I was nere at in my life; but, Lord! to see the
strange variety of people, from Parliament man by name Wildes, that was
Deputy Governor of the Tower when Robinson was Lord Mayor, to the
poorest ’prentices, bakers, brewers, butchers, draymen, and what not;
and all these fellows one with another cursing and betting. I soon had
enough of it. It is strange to see how people of this poor rank, that
look as if they had not bread to put in their mouths, shall bet three or
four pounds at a time, and lose it, and yet bet as much the next battle,
so that one of them will lose £10 or £20 at a meeting."

\* "6th April 1668.--I to the new Cocke-pitt by the king's gate, and
there saw the manner of it, and the mixed rabble of people that come
thither, and saw two battles of cocks, wherein is no great sport, but
only to consider how these creatures, without any provocation, do fight
and kill one another, and aim only at one another."

\* Although constantly reviled as a singularly cruel and coarse sport by
the more refined, cock-fighting or cocking kept a continuous hold on the
more sporting natures in England throughout the eighteenth century and
in the earlier part of the nineteenth. In 1814, W. Sketchley of
Burton-on-Trent published a book called *The Cocker*, which professed to
contain every information useful "to the breeders and amateurs of that
noble bird the Game Cock," with instruction for those who were
attendants on the cock-pit. The names of the leading varieties of cocks
then bred in different parts of the kingdom were Piles, Black-reds,
Silver black-breasted Ducks, Pirchin Ducks, Dark Greys, Mealy Greys,
Blacks, Spangles, Furnaces, Poll Cats, Cuckoos, Gingers, Red Duns, Duns,
and Smoky Duns. Sketchley's own favourite breed was the Shropshire Red,
a strain that originated in 1785-86 from thirty pairs of cocks that he
bought of his "reverend friend," Rev. Mr. Brooks of Shiffnal,
Shropshire. One of these cocks fought five mains in one year, twice at
Burton-on-Trent, and once at Lichfield, Derby, and Nottingham, "without
apparent injury."

COCK-FIGHTING IN NINETEENTH CENTURY.--Cock-fighting became illegal in
1849. In 1895 *Cocking and its Votaries*, by S. A. T., was issued for
private circulation. It is an expensively got-up book, with coloured
plates, and its pages make it quite manifest that not a few wealthy men
in England still follow up this sport, stealthily but with much zeal--a
fact that is as discreditable to the guardians of the law as it is to
themselves.

THROWING AT COCKS.--If the opposing of one cock to fight with another
may be justly esteemed a national barbarism, what shall be said of a
custom more inhuman, which authorised the throwing at them with sticks,
and ferociously putting them to a painful and lingering death? I know
not at what time this unfortunate animal became the object of such
wicked and wanton abuse: the sport, if such a denomination may be given
to it, is certainly no recent invention, and perhaps is alluded to by
Chaucer, in the Nonnes Priests' Tale, when he says:

         "----------There was a cocke,  
For that a priestes' sonne gave hym a knocke,<span id="page_227">p.
227</span>  
Upon his legges, when he was yonge and nice,  
He made him for to lose his benefice."

The story supposes the cock to have overheard the young man ordering his
servant to call him at the cock-crowing; upon which the malicious bird
forbore to crow at the usual time, and owing to this artifice the youth
was suffered to sleep till the ordination was over.

Throwing at cocks was a very popular diversion, especially among the
younger parts of the community. Sir Thomas Moore, who wrote in the
sixteenth century, describing the state of childhood, speaks of his
skill in casting a cokstele, that is, a stick or cudgel to throw at a
cock. It was universally practised upon Shrove-Tuesday. If the poor bird
by chance had its legs broken, or was otherwise so lamed as not to be
able to stand, the barbarous owners were wont to support it with sticks,
in order to prolong the pleasure received from the re-iteration of its
torment. The magistrates, greatly to their credit, have for some years
past put a stop to this wicked custom, and at present (1800) it is
nearly, if not entirely, discontinued in every part of the kingdom.

Heath, in his account of the Scilly Islands, <span
id="fr_769"></span>[1](#fn_768.md) speaking of St Mary's, says, "on
Shrove-Tuesday each year, after the throwing at cocks is over, the boys
of this island have a custom of throwing stones in the evening against
the doors of the dwellers' houses; a privilege they claim from time
immemorial, and put in practice without control, for finishing the day's
sport; the terms demanded by the boys are pancakes or money, to
capitulate. Some of the older sort, exceeding the bounds of this
whimsical toleration, break the doors and window-shutters, etc.
sometimes making a job for the surgeon as well as for the smith,
glazier, and carpenter."

In some places it was a common practice to put the cock into an earthen
vessel made for the purpose, and to place him in such a position that
his head and tail might be exposed to view; the vessel, with the bird in
it, was then suspended across the street, about twelve or fourteen feet
from the ground, to be thrown at by such as chose to make trial of their
skill; twopence was paid for four throws, and he who broke the pot, and
delivered the cock from his confinement, had him for a reward. At North
Walsham, in Norfolk, about 1760, some wags put an owl into one of these
vessels; and having procured the head and tail of a dead cock, they
placed them in the same position as if they had appertained to a living
one: the deception was successful, and at last, a labouring man
belonging to the town, after several fruitless attempts, broke the pot,
but missed his prize; for the owl being set at liberty, instantly flew
away, to his great astonishment, and left him nothing more than the head
and tail of the dead bird, with the potsherds, for his money and his
trouble; this ridiculous adventure exposed him to the continual laughter
of the town's people, and obliged him to quit the place, to which, I am
told, he returned no more.

DUCK-HUNTING.--This is another barbarous pastime, and for the
performance

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

it is necessary to have recourse to a pond of water sufficiently
extensive to give the duck plenty of room for making her escape from the
dogs when she is closely pursued; which she does by diving as often as
any of them come near to her. Duck-hunting was much practised in the
neighbourhood of London about thirty or forty years ago; but of late it
is gone out of fashion; yet I cannot help thinking, that the deficiency,
at present, of places proper for the purpose, has done more towards the
abolishment of this sport than any amendment in the nature and
inclinations of the populace.

Sometimes the duck is tormented in a different manner, without the
assistance of the dogs, by having an owl tied upon her back, and so put
into the water, where she frequently dives in order to escape from the
burden, and on her return for air, the miserable owl, half drowned,
shakes itself, and hooting, frightens the duck; she of course dives
again, and replunges the owl into the water; the frequent repetition of
this action soon deprives the poor bird of its sensation, and generally
ends in its death, if not in that of the duck also.

SQUIRREL-HUNTING.--This is a rustic pastime, and commonly practised at
Christmas time and at Midsummer; those who pursue it find plenty of
exercise; but nothing can excuse the wantonly tormenting so harmless an
animal.

\* "At Duffield wakes," says Glover in his history of Derbyshire (1831),
"an ancient custom or right is kept up of hunting wild animals in the
forest there. This is called the squirrel hunt. The young men of the
village assemble in troops on the wakes Monday, some with horns, some
with pans, and others with various articles calculated to make a great
noise. They then proceed in a body to Kedleston Park, and with shouting
and the noise of instruments, frighten the poor little animals until
they drop from the trees and are taken by the hunters. After taking
several in this manner, the hunters go back to Duffield, release the
squirrels, and recommence hunting them again in a similar manner."

\* This Derbyshire custom died out in the early fifties, but it survives
as a Christmas custom in parts of the New Forest, particularly at
Brockenhurst. The hunted squirrels are made into pies, which are said to
be more delicate in flavour than rabbits. <span
