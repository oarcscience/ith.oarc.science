SLINGING OF STONES.--The art of slinging, or casting of stones with a
sling, is of high antiquity, and probably antecedent to that of archery,
though not so generally known nor so universally practised. The tribe of
Benjamin among the Israelites is celebrated in holy writ for the
excellency of its slingers. In the time of the judges there were seven
hundred Benjamites who all of them used their left hands, and in the
figurative language of the Scripture it is said, they "could sling
stones at an hair-breadth and not miss," <span
id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_287.md) that is, with exceedingly great
precision. Again we are told, that when David fled to Ziklag, he was
joined by a party of valiant men of the tribe of Benjamin, who could use
both the right and the left in slinging of stones and shooting arrows
out of a bow. <span id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_288.md) David himself was
also an excellent marksman, as the destruction of Goliath by the means
of his sling sufficiently testifies. It was, perhaps, an instrument much
used by the shepherds in ancient times, to protect their flocks from the
attacks of ferocious animals: if so, we shall not wonder that David, who
kept his father's sheep, was so expert in the management of this
weapon. <span id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_289.md)

\* SLINGING BY THE ANGLO-SAXONS.--The later Assyrian sculptures
frequently show soldiers armed with the sling, and the Persians, as we
gather from Xenophon, were expert slingers. Sling bullets of lead,
stone, and hard-baked clay or terra-cotta were used by the Romans; their
slingers were an important light-armed division of their armies; they
appear on the Trajan column. Sling stones have been found, occasionally
in considerable numbers, at Romano-British stations; but there are also
good reasons for knowing that the archaic tribes of the British Isles
were well acquainted with the use of the sling long before the arrival
of the Romans. Stones for this purpose have been found in early barrows
and entrenchments, both in England and Ireland. <span
id="fr_290"></span>[4](#fn_290.md) The sling and its deadly effects are
frequently alluded to in the Irish annals.

Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors were skilful in the management of the sling;
its form is preserved in several of their paintings, and the manner in
which it was used by them, as far back as the eighth century, may be
seen on plate five, from

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

a manuscript of that age in the Cotton Library. <span
id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_291.md) It is there represented with one of the
ends unloosened from the hand and the stone discharged. In the original
the figure is throwing the stone at a bird upon the wing, which is
represented at some distance from him.

In other instances we see it depicted with both the ends held in the
hand, the figure being placed in the action of taking his aim, and a
bird is generally the object of his exertion, as in another drawing on
the same plate from a parchment roll in the Royal Library, containing a
genealogical account of the kings of England to the time of Henry
III. <span id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_292.md)

Sometimes the sling is attached to a staff or truncheon, about three or
four feet in length, wielded with both hands, and charged with a stone
of no small magnitude. These staff-slings, known by the Romans as
*fuslibalus*, appear to have been chiefly used in besieging of cities,
and on board of ships in engagements by sea. The representation of two
such slings on plate five is taken from a drawing supposed to have been
made by Matthew Paris, in a MS. at Bennet’ College, Cambridge. <span
id="fr_293"></span>[3](#fn_293.md)

SLINGING BY THE ANGLO-NORMANS.--We have sufficient testimony to prove
that men armed with slings formed a part of the Anglo-Norman
soldiery, <span id="fr_294"></span>[4](#fn_294.md) and the word
*balistarii*, used by our early historians, may, I doubt not, be more
properly rendered slingers than cross-bowmen; though indeed, upon the
introduction of the cross-bow, these men might take the place of the
slingers. In fact the cross-bow itself was modified to the purpose of
discharging of stones, and for that reason was also called a stone-bow,
so that the appellation *Balistarius* and *Arcubalistarius* were both of
them latterly applied to the same person. At the battle of Hastings
slingers formed part of both the armies; from this period until the
close of the fourteenth century they formed an important element in
every military expedition. They also continued to be used for fowling
purposes, and doubtless often for mere pastime. The sling, however, was
not entirely superseded by the bow at the commencement of the fifteenth
century, as the following verses plainly indicate: they occur in a
manuscript poem in the Cotton Library, <span
id="fr_295"></span>[5](#fn_295.md) entitled, "Knyghthode and Batayle,"
written about that time, which professedly treats upon the duties and
exercises necessary to constitute a good soldier.

Use eek the cast of stone, with slynge or honde:  
It falleth ofte, yf other shot there none is,  
Men harneysed in steel may not withstonde,  
The multitude and mighty cast of stonys;  
And stonys in effecte, are every where,  
And slynges are not noyous for to beare.

By the two last lines the poet means to say, that stones are every where
readily procured, and that the slings are by no means cumbersome to the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

bearers, which were cogent reasons for retaining them as military
weapons; neither does he confine their use to any body or rank of
soldiers, but indiscriminately recommends the acquirement of skill in
the casting of stones, to every individual who followed the profession
of a warrior.

\* In the metrical tale of *King Edward and the Shepherd* (fourteenth
century), the countryman exclaims--

"I have slyngs smort and good";

and proudly declares--

"The best archer of ilk one  
I durst meet him with a stone,  
    And gif him lefe to shoot.  
There is no bow that shall laste  
To draw to my slyng's cast."

In Barclay's *Eclogues*, issued in 1508, a shepherd states that--

"I can dance the rage; I can both pipe and sing  
If I were mery; I can both hurl and sling."

Leland in his *Itinerary*, when describing the isle of Portland in 1536,
states--"The people be good there in slyngging of stonys, and use it for
defence of the isle."

MODERN MODES OF SLINGING.--I remember in my youth to have seen several
persons expert in slinging of stones, which they performed with thongs
of leather, or, wanting those, with garters; and sometimes they used a
stick of ash or hazel, a yard or better in length, and about an inch in
diameter; it was split at the top so as to make an opening wide enough
to receive the stone, which was confined by the re-action of the stick
on both sides, but not strong enough to resist the impulse of the
slinger. It required much practice to handle this instrument with any
great degree of certainty, for if the stone in the act of throwing
quitted the sling either sooner or later than it ought to do, the
desired effect was sure to fail. Those who could use it properly, cast
stones to a considerable distance and with much precision. In the
present day (1800) the use of all these engines seems to be totally
discontinued.

THROWING WITH THE HAND.--Throwing of heavy weights and stones with the
hand was much practised in former times, and as this pastime required
great strength and muscular exertion, it was a very proper exercise for
military men. The Greeks, according to Homer, at the time of the siege
of Troy, amused themselves with casting of the discus, which appears to
have been a round flat plate of metal of considerable magnitude and very
heavy. <span id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_296.md) "The discus of the
ancients," says Dr Johnson, in his dictionary, "is sometimes called in
English quoit, not improperly. The game of quoits is a game of skill;
the discus was only a trial of strength, as among us to throw the
hammer."

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

THROWING BY THE LONDONERS.--In the twelfth century we are assured, that
among the amusements practised by the young Londoners on holidays, was
casting of stones, <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297.md) darts, and
other missive weapons. Bars of wood and iron were afterwards used for
the same purpose, and the attention of the populace was so much engaged
by this kind of exercise, that they neglected in great measure the
practice of archery, which occasioned an edict to be passed in the
thirty-ninth year of Edward III. prohibiting the pastimes of throwing of
stones, wood, and iron, and recommending the use of the long-bow upon
all convenient opportunities. <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md)

CASTING OF THE BAR AND HAMMER.--Casting of the bar is frequently
mentioned by the romance writers as one part of a hero's education, and
a poet of the sixteenth century thinks it highly commendable for kings
and princes, by way of exercise, to throw "the stone, the barre, or the
plummet." Henry VIII., after his accession to the throne, according to
Hall and Holinshead, retained "the casting of the barre" among his
favourite amusements. The sledge hammer was also used for the same
purpose as the bar and the stone; and among the rustics, if Barclay be
correct, an axletree.

An early instance of throwing the stone occurs in a manuscript of the
thirteenth century; it is reproduced at the top of plate
sixty-two. <span id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_299.md)

\* Throughout the reign of Henry VIII., encouraged by royal example,
gentlemen were eager to take part in pedestrian as well as equestrian
exercises. Sir William Forest, in his *Poesye of Princelye Practice*,
holds that a gentleman should--

"In featis of maistries bestowe some diligence Too ryde, runne, lepe, or
caste by violence Stone, barre, or plummett, or such other thinge It not
refuseth any prince or kynge."

\* Elyot's *Governour* names "labouryng with poyses made of ledde, and
lifting and throwing the heavy stone or barre." At the commencement of
the seventeenth century, these pastimes seem to have lost their relish
among the higher classes of the people, and for this reason Peacham, in
his *Complete Gentleman*, speaks of throwing the hammer as an exercise
proper for soldiers in camp, or for the amusement of the prince's guard,
but not so well "beseeming nobility."

\* Hammer throwing, as a modern athletic sport, follows the form that
has come to us from over the Border. The weight of the hammer is the
same as that of the weight in weight-putting, namely, sixteen pounds.

THROWING OF SPEARS.--Throwing of darts and javelins being properly a
military exercise, was not prohibited by the act above mentioned. In
1529 Erasmus, writing to Cochloeus, said that the king outstripped every
one in throwing the dart. Chafrins, ambassador of Charles V., wrote in
1532 that Anne Boleyn had presented Henry with certain darts of Biscayan
fashion richly ornamented. <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_300.md) It was
sometimes practised as a mere trial of strength, when the attempt was to
throw beyond a certain boundary, or to exceed a competitor in

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

distance; and of skill, when the spear was cast at a quintain, or any
other determined mark. The pastime is frequently mentioned by the
writers of the middle ages. Charles VI. of France and the lords of his
court, after a grand entertainment, were amused with "Wrastling, and
casting of the bar, and the dart, by Frenchmen and the Gascoyns." <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_301.md)

QUOITS.--The game of quoits, or coits, as an amusement, is superior to
any of the foregoing pastimes; the exertion required is more moderate,
because this exercise does not depend so much upon superior strength as
upon superior skill. The quoit seems evidently to have derived its
origin from the ancient discus, and with us in the present day it is a
circular plate of iron perforated in the middle, not always of one size,
but larger or smaller to suit the strength or conveniency of the several
candidates. It is further to be observed, that quoits are not only made
of different magnitudes to suit the poise of the players, but sometimes
the marks are placed at extravagant distances, so as to require great
strength to throw the quoit home; this, however, is contrary to the
general rule, and depends upon the caprice of the parties engaged in the
contest.

\* An interesting reference to quoit-playing early in the fifteenth
century has recently come to light. When the evidence was taken as to
alleged miracles at the tomb of Bishop Osmund of Salisbury, before a
papal commission, for the purpose of procuring his canonisation, four
witnesses testified to the marvellous recovery of Cristina Cerlee, a
girl of nine years of age, on St Mark's Day, 1409; the child was struck
by accident by a quoit on the head so severely that the brain was
exposed and she was taken up for dead and lay lifeless for an hour and a
half. Richard Wodewell, carpenter, stated that he was playing quoits
with his companions at Laverstock when he overthrew an iron quoit
weighing a pound, and it struck Cristina who was seated on the ground
twelve feet beyond the mark. Others picked her up saying she was killed,
and he at once ran to the church of Salisbury for refuge, and there
prayed to God, the Blessed Virgin and Bishop Osmund, at the bishop's
tomb for the child's life. Cristina recovered, and made an offering of
the quoit at the tomb. <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_302.md)

\* Quoits was one of those games prohibited in the reigns of Edward III.
and Richard II. in favour of archery. Ascham, in his *Toxophilus*
(1545), says that "quoiting be too vile for scholars." It seems always
to have been, as at present, a game chiefly popular among the
working-classes, although it admits of much skill, dexterity, and
judgment.

To play at this game, an iron pin, called a hob, is driven into the
ground, within a few inches of the top; and at the distance of eighteen,
twenty, or more yards, for the distance is optional, a second pin of
iron is also made fast in a similar manner; two or more persons, as
four, six, eight, or more at pleasure, who divided into two equal
parties are to contend for the victory, stand at one

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

of the iron marks and throw an equal number of quoits to the other, and
the nearest of them to the hob are reckoned towards the game. But the
determination is discriminately made: for instance, if a quoit belonging
to A lies nearest to the hob, and a quoit belonging to B the second, A
can claim but one towards the game, though all his other quoits lie
nearer to the mark than all the other quoits of B; because one quoit of
B being the second nearest to the hob, cuts out, as it is called, all
behind it: if no such quoit had interfered, then A would have reckoned
all his as one each. Having cast all their quoits, the candidates walk
to the opposite side, and determine the state of the play, then taking
their stand there, throw their quoits back again and continue to do so
alternately as long as the game remains undecided.

Formerly in the country, the rustics not having the round perforated
quoits to play with, used horse-shoes, and in many places the quoit
itself, to this day, is called a shoe.

DUMB BELLS.--John Northbroke, in a treatise against Diceing, Dancing,
etc. written in the time of queen Elizabeth, advises young men, by way
of amusement, to "labour with poises of lead or other metal"; this
notable pastime, I apprehend, bore some resemblance to the Skiomachia
(Σκιομαχια) or fighting with a man's own shadow, mentioned in one of the
Spectators: <span id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_303.md) "It consisted," says
the author, "in brandishing of two sticks, grasped in each hand and
loaden with plugs of lead at either end;--this pastime opens the chest,
exercises the limbs, and gives a man all the pleasure of boxing without
the blows." It is sometimes practised in the present day, and called
"ringing of the dumb bells."

\* The use of dumb-bells, and of the bar-bell which is but a two-handed
dumb-bell, still forms one of the most important elements of modern
gymnastics.

\* The origin of the term is somewhat curious. Dumb-bells take their
name by analogy, as was pointed out in *Notes and Queries* in 1861,
"from a machine used for exercise, consisting of a rough, heavy, wooden
flywheel with a rope passing through and round a spindle . . . and set
in motion like a church bell." <span id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_304.md)
This statement, however, does not sufficiently explain the transference
of such a name to the short bar and rounded lead or iron ends of a hand
dumb-bell. This difficulty was explained by the late Chancellor Ferguson
in a paper read before the Archæological Institute in 1895, wherein a
dumb-bell apparatus, now at Lord Sackville's seat at Knowle, was
described and illustrated. <span id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_305.md) The
roller round which the rope winds and unwinds has four iron arms, each
of which has a leaden poise or ball at the end, just like the end of an
ordinary hand dumb-bell. This Knowle example is fixed in an attic and
the rope passed through to a gallery beneath. Anyone pulling the rope
would get much the same exercise as in pulling a bell rope in a church
tower, but without annoying his neighbours by the noise. There used to
be a similar apparatus at New College, Oxford. The date of such
contrivances for exercise cannot be older than the opening of

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

the seventeenth century when the practice of change-ringing in England
first began. Change-ringing became fashionable among gentlemen in the
reign of Charles II., and the healthiness of the exercise was much
vaunted. <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_306.md)

FOOT-RACING.--There is no kind of exercise that has more uniformly met
the approbation of authors in general than running. In the middle ages,
foot-racing was considered as an essential part of a young man's
education, especially if he was the son of a man of rank, and brought up
to a military profession.

It is needless, I doubt not, to assert the antiquity of this pastime,
because it will readily occur to every one, that variety of occasions
continually present themselves, which call forth the exertions of
running even in childhood; and when more than one person are stimulated
by the same object, a competition naturally takes place among them to
obtain it. Originally, perhaps, foot-races had no other incitement than
emulation, or at best the prospect of some small reward: but in process
of time the rewards were magnified, and contests of this kind were
instituted as public amusements; the ground marked out for that purpose,
and judges appointed to decide upon the fairness of the race, to
ascertain the winner, and to bestow the reward.

In Sir Thomas Elyot's *Governour*, "rennyng" is named as "bothe a goode
exercise and a laudable solace;" he defends the custom of running races
by references to such heroes of classical antiquity as Achilles,
Alexander, and Epaminondas. Both private matches and public competitions
are mentioned by Shakespeare. Falstaff says to Poins: "I could give a
thousand pounds I could run as fast as thou canst." In the third part of
Henry VI. occur the lines--

"Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,  
I lay me down a little while to breathe."

\[paragraph continues\] Running was one of the exercises commended to
his son by James I.

\* After the Restoration, every form of sport was resumed with vigour.
Pepys' Diary contains many references to foot races. On August 10th,
1660, Pepys went "With Mr Moore and Creed to Hide Park by coach, and saw
a fine footrace three times round the Park between an Irishman and Crew,
that was once my Lord Claypoole's footman." On July 30th, 1663, he
writes: "The town talk this day is of nothing but the great foot-race
run this day on Banstead Downes, between Lee, the Duke of Richmond's
footman, and a tiler, a famous runner. And Lee hath beat him; though the
king and Duke of York, and all men almost, did bet three or four to one
upon the tiler's head." Occasionally noblemen performed feats of this
description. Pepys records the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

remarkable performance, for a wager before the king, of Lords
Castlehaven and Arran, when they ran down and killed a buck in St James'
park. He also praised the extraordinary nimbleness of the Duke of
Monmouth, of whom Macaulay says that he "won foot-races in his boots
against fleet runners in shoes." The *Luttrell Papers* mention that in
1690 "Mr Peregrine Bertie, son to the late Earl of Lindsey, upon a
wager, ran the Mall in St James' Park eleven times in less than an
hour."

\* Philip Kinder, in his MS. *History of Derbyshire*, written about the
middle of the seventeenth century, says of the natives of that shire:
"Theire exercise for a greate part is y<sup>e</sup> Gymnopaidia or naked
boy, an ould recreation among y<sup>e</sup> Greeks, and this in
foote-races. You shall have in a winter's day, y<sup>e</sup> earth
crusted over w<sup>th</sup> ice, two Antagonists starke naked runn a
foote-race for 2 or 3 miles, w<sup>th</sup> many hundred spectators, and
y<sup>e</sup> betts very smale." <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_307.md)

\* Any attempt to deal with foot-racing in the eighteenth century would
require a whole treatise, and would for the most part be a record of
foolish contests for extravagant wagers. It will suffice to quote a
paragraph from the first chapter of the standard work on modern English
athletics. "The annals of the eighteenth century are full of accounts of
wagers for the performance of athletic feats, both sublime as well as
ridiculous. The majority of the genuine athletic performances are those
of professional pedestrians, amateurs only figuring occasionally in
these wagers, and often in preposterous ones. Luttrell's *Diary* tells
us of a wager made by a German of sixty-four years old, to walk 300
miles in Hyde Park in six days, which he did within the time and a mile
over. In 1780, the *Gentleman's Magazine* tells us that a man of
seventy-five years ran four miles and a half round Queen Square in 58
minutes. Eight years later a young gentleman, with a jockey booted and
spurred on his back, ran a match against an elderly fat man (of the name
of Bullock) running without a rider. The more extraordinary the wager
the more excitement it often caused amongst the public. A fish-hawker is
reported to have run for a wager seven miles, from Hyde Park Corner to
Brentford, with 56 lbs. weight of fish on his head, in 45 minutes!
Another man trundled a coach-wheel eight miles in an hour round a
platform erected in St Giles' Fields. Another extraordinary match was
one between a man on stilts against a man on foot, the former receiving
twenty yards start in a hundred and twenty yards. What is more
astounding is that the man upon the stilts won the match." <span
id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_308.md)

Foot-races are not now (1800) much encouraged by persons of fortune, and
seldom happen but for the purpose of betting, and the racers are
generally paid for their performance. In many instances the distance
does not exceed one hundred yards. At fairs, wakes, and upon many other
occasions where many people are assembled together, this species of
amusement is sometimes promoted, but most frequently the contest is
confined to the younger part of the concourse.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

\* Foot-racing in connection with wedding festivities was a very old
custom in the north of England, and still lingers in some parts of north
Yorkshire. In that charming book, *Forty Years in a Moorland Parish*, by
the late Canon Atkinson, incumbent of Danby-in-Cleveland, published in
1891, occur the following passages--

"The most typical Dales Wedding I ever remember having witnessed was
nearly forty years ago, and on Martinmas Day. But I should not have
spoken of the event in the singular number; for there were, in point of
fact, four weddings all to be solemnised coincidently. . . . After the
ceremony was over, great was the scramble among the small boys for the
coppers, which it was and is customary for the newly-married man, or his
best man, to scatter the moment the chancel door is left. And then an
adjournment to the field adjoining the churchyard was made, and there
was a series of races, all on foot, to be run for the ribbons which were
the gift of the several brides; and as some of them gave more than one,
the races were multiplied accordingly. Time was, and not so very long
before the commencement of my incumbency here, when these races were
ridden on horseback; and, at an earlier period still, the race was a
'steeple-chase' across country--the goal being the house whence the
bride had come, and to which the wedding cavalcade was to return for the
usual festivities. More than once, too, I have known, when the bride in
some way incurred the suspicion of niggardness, through not complying
with the recognised usage of supplying one ribbon at least to be run
for, the 'stithy was fired upon her,' *i.e.* a charge of powder was
rammed into a hole in the anvil (much after the shot in a mine), and
fired in derision; well pronounced, if the loudness of the report
counted for anything, as the wedding party passed on the journey home
from the church. The direct converse of this, was the firing of guns as
the party passed the residences of friends and well wishers. . . . The
races still linger on, and only a week or two since the bride gave two
'ribbons to be run for'; and a few years ago one young chap, fleet of
foot, and with as much inclination for 'laiking' (playing) as for
sticking to work--some folk said more--was quoted as the fortunate
winner of almost enough to start an itinerant haberdasher in
trade." <span id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_309.md)

BASE, OR PRISONERS' BARS.--There is a rustic game called Base or Bars,
and sometimes written Bays, <span id="fr_310"></span>[2](#fn_310.md) and in
some places Prisoners' Bars; and as the success of this pastime depends
upon the agility of the candidates and their skill in running, I think
it may properly enough be introduced here. It was much practised in
former times, and some vestiges of the game are still remaining in

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

many parts of the kingdom. The first mention of this sport that I have
met with occurs in the Proclamations at the head of the parliamentary
proceedings, early in the reign of Edward III., where it is spoken of as
a childish amusement, and prohibited to be played in the avenues of the
palace at Westminster, <span id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_311.md) during the
sessions of Parliament, because of the interruption it occasioned to the
members and others in passing to and fro as their business required. It
is also spoken of by Shakespear as a game practised by the boys:

He with two striplings, lads more like to run  
The country base, than to commit such slaughter,  
Made good the passage. <span id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_312.md)

\[paragraph continues\] It was, however, most assuredly played by the
men, and especially in Cheshire and other adjoining counties, where
formerly it seems to have been in high repute.

The performance of this pastime requires two parties of equal number,
each of them having a base or home, as it is usually called, to
themselves, at the distance of about twenty or thirty yards. The players
then on either side taking hold of hands, extend themselves in length,
and opposite to each other, as far as they conveniently can, always
remembering that one of them must touch the base; when any one of them
quits the hand of his fellow and runs into the field, which is called
giving the chase, he is immediately followed by one of his opponents; he
again is followed by a second from the former side, and he by a second
opponent; and so on alternately, until as many are out as choose to run,
every one pursuing the man he first followed, and no other; and if he
overtake him near enough to touch him, his party claims one toward their
game, and both return home. They then run forth again and again in like
manner, until the number is completed that decides the victory; this
number is optional, and I am told rarely exceeds twenty. It is to be
observed, that every person on either side who touches another during
the chase, claims one for his party, and when many are out, it
frequently happens that many are touched.

About 1770, I saw a grand match at base played in the fields behind
Montague House, now the British Museum, by twelve gentlemen of Cheshire
against twelve of Derbyshire, for a considerable sum of money, which
afforded much entertainment to the spectators. In Essex they play this
game with the addition of two prisons, which are stakes driven into the
ground, parallel with the home boundaries, and about thirty yards from
them; and every person who is touched on either side in the chase, is
sent to one or other of these prisons, where he must remain till the
conclusion of the game, if not delivered previously by one of his
associates, and this can only be accomplished by touching him, which is
a difficult task, requiring the performance of the most skilful players,
because the prison belonging to either party is always much nearer to
the base of their opponents than to their own; and if the person sent to
relieve his confederate be touched by an antagonist before he reaches
him, he also becomes

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

a prisoner, and stands in equal need of deliverance. The addition of the
prisons occasions a considerable degree of variety in the pastime, and
is frequently productive of much pleasantry.

WRESTLING.--The art of wrestling, which in the present day is chiefly
confined to the lower classes of the people, was, however, highly
esteemed by the ancients, and made a very considerable figure among the
Olympic games. In the ages of chivalry, to wrestle well was accounted
one of the accomplishments which a hero ought to possess.

Wrestling is a kind of exercise that, from its nature, is likely to have
been practised by every nation, and especially by those the least
civilised. It was probably well known in this country long before the
introduction of foreign manners. The inhabitants of Cornwall and Devon
have, we are well assured, from time immemorial, been celebrated for
their expertness in this pastime, and are universally said to be the
best wrestlers in the kingdom. To give a Cornish hug is a proverbial
expression. The Cornish, says Fuller, are masters of the art of
wrestling, so that if the Olympian games were now in fashion, they would
come away with the victory. Their hug is a cunning close with their
fellow-combatants, the fruits whereof is his fair fall or foil at the
least. <span id="fr_313"></span>[1](#fn_313.md) They learned the art at an
early period of life, for you shall hardly find, says Carew, an assembly
of boys in Devon and Cornwall, where the most untowardly among them will
not as readily give you a muster (or trial) of this exercise as you are
prone to require it. <span id="fr_314"></span>[2](#fn_314.md)

\* The entirely different systems of wrestling developed in different
parts of the kingdom is a slight but genuine proof of the great variety
of nationalities and tribes that were involved in the making of England.
Owing to difficulties of locomotion, these different methods held their
own in their respective districts until comparatively modern days. The
styles of Cornwall and Devon are usually reckoned together, though they
differed in at least one important particular, namely, that the latter
sanctioned kicking and tripping, whilst the former confined themselves
almost entirely to hugging. The style of Cumberland and Westmoreland was
the next most famous. Thirdly, there was the more general practice of
"loose" wrestling, in which Norfolk and Bedfordshire were for a long
time pre-eminent; this style differed much in different
localities. <span id="fr_315"></span>[3](#fn_315.md)

The citizens of London, in times past, were expert in the art of
wrestling, and annually upon St James's day they were accustomed to make
a public trial of their skill. In the sixth year of Henry III. they held
their anniversary meeting for this purpose near the hospital of St
Matilda, at St Giles's-in-the-Fields, where they were met by the
inhabitants of the city and suburbs of Westminster, and a ram was
appointed for the prize; the Londoners were victorious, having greatly
excelled their antagonists, which produced a challenge from the
conquered party, to renew the contest upon the Lammas day following at
Westminster:

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

the citizens of London readily consented, and met them accordingly, but
in the midst of the diversion, the bailiff of Westminster and his
associates took occasion to quarrel with the Londoners, a battle ensued,
and many of the latter were severely wounded in making their retreat to
the city. This unjustifiable petulance of the bailiff gave rise to a
more serious tumult, and it was several days before the peace could be
restored. <span id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_316.md) Stow informs us, that in
the thirty-first year of Henry VI. A.D. 1453, at a wrestling match near
Clerkenwell, another tumult was excited against the lord mayor, but he
does not say upon what occasion it arose.

In the old time, says Stow, wrestling was more used than it has been of
later years. <span id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_317.md) In the month of
August, about the feast of St Bartholomew, adds this very accurate
historian, there were divers days spent in wrestling; the lord mayor,
aldermen, and sheriffs, being present in a large tent pitched for that
purpose near Clerkenwell; <span id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_318.md) upon
this occasion the officers of the city, namely, the sheriffs, serjeants,
and yeomen, the porters of the king's beam or weighing-house, and others
of the city, gave a general challenge to such of the inhabitants of the
suburbs as thought themselves expert in this exercise; but of late
years, continues he, the wrestling is only practised on the afternoon of
St Bartholomew's day. <span id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_319.md) The latter
ceremony is thus described by a foreign writer, who was an eye-witness
to the performance: "When," says he, "the mayor goes out of the
precincts of the city, a sceptre, <span id="fr_320"></span>[5](#fn_320.md)
a sword, and a cap, are borne before him, and he is followed by the
principal aldermen in scarlet gowns with golden chains; himself and they
on horseback. Upon their arrival at a place appointed for that purpose,
where a tent is pitched for their reception, the mob begin to wrestle
before them two at a time." He adds a circumstance not recorded by the
historian: "After this is over, a parcel of live rabbits are turned
loose among the crowd, which are pursued by a number of boys, who
endeavour to catch them with all the noise they can make." <span
id="fr_321"></span>[6](#fn_321.md)

PRIZES FOR WRESTLING.--The reward proposed for the best wrestlers in the
contest between the Londoners and the inhabitants of Westminster, as
mentioned above, was a ram. Anciently this animal was the prize most
usually given upon such occasions, and therefore in the rhyme of sir
Thopas, Chaucer says of the Knight,

Of wrastling was there none his pere,  
Where any Ram shulde stonde.

\[paragraph continues\] And again, in his character of the miller,

     ----------for over al ther he cam,  
At wrastlyng he wolde have away the Ram.

\[paragraph continues\] Other rewards, no doubt, were sometimes
proposed, as we may see upon the eighth plate, where two men are
wrestling for a cock: the original drawing, from a manuscript in the
Royal Library, <span id="fr_322"></span>[7](#fn_322.md) is certainly more
ancient than the time

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

of Chaucer. This is clearly an example of "loose" wrestling, when the
hob was got with the open hand, grasping either the body or tunic of the
opponent or, as in this case, of a sort of scarf put on for the purpose.

In later times the prizes were not only much varied, but were
occasionally of higher value. If we may believe the author of the old
poem, entitled "A mery Geste of Robyn Hode," there were several prizes
put up at once. The poet, speaking of a knight who was going to Robin
Hood, says, <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_323.md)

                 ------Unto Bernisdale,  
As he went, by a bridge was a wrastling,  
  And there taryed was he,  
And there was all the best yemen,  
  Of all the west countrey.  
A full fayre game there was set up;  
  A white bull, up ypyght;  
A great courser with sadle and brydle,  
  With gold burnished full bryght:  
A payre of gloves, a red gold ringe,  
  A pipe of wine, good faye:  
What man bereth him best, ywis,  
  The prize shall bear away.

A humorous description is given in one of the Spectators of a country
wake: the author there mentions "a ring of wrestlers; the squire," says
he "of the parish always treats the whole company, every year, with a
hogshead of ale, and proposes a beaver hat, as a recompence to him who
gives the most falls." <span id="fr_324"></span>[2](#fn_324.md)

WRESTLING, HOW PERFORMED.--The manner in which this pastime was
exhibited in the western parts of England, at the distance of two
centuries, it thus described by Carew, an author then living. "The
beholders then cast, of form themselves into a ring, in the empty space
whereof the two champion step forth, stripped into their dublets and
hosen, and untrussed, that they may so the better command the use of
their lymmes; and first shaking hands, it token of friendship, they fall
presently to the effect of anger; for each striveth how to take hold of
the other with his best advantage, and to bear his adverse party downe;
wherein, whosoever overthroweth his mate, in such sort, as that either
his backe, or the one shoulder, and contrary heele do touch the ground
is accounted to give the fall. If he be only endangered, and makes a
narrow escape, it is called a foyle."

He then adds, "This pastime also hath his laws, for instance; of taking
hold above the girdle--wearing a girdle to take hold by--playing three
pull; for trial of the mastery, the fall giver to be exempted from
playing again with the taker, but bound to answer his successor. Silver
prizes, for this and other activities, were wont to be carried about, by
certain circumferanci, or set up at bride ales; but time, or their
abuse," perhaps I might add both, "hath now worn them out of use." <span

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

\* SIR THOMAS PARKYNS.--Towards the end of the seventeenth century
wrestling was much declining in importance and respectability; but it
received a considerable impetus from the strenuous support of a
Nottingham-shire squire of education and position. Sir Thomas Parkyns,
Bart., of Bunny Park, Nottingham, was the author of a curious work
entitled, "The Inn-Play, or the Cornish-Hugg Wrestler. Digested in a
Method which teacheth to break all Holds, and throw most Falls
Mathematically. Easie to be understood by all Gentlemen, etc., and of
great Use to such who understand the Small Sword in Fencing. And by all
Tradesmen and Handicrafts that have competent knowledge of the Use of
the Stilliards, Bor, Crove-Iron, or Lever, with their Hypomochlions,
Fulcimen or Baits." A corrected second edition, from which this title is
taken, was issued in 1714. Sir Thomas begins his "prefatory
introduction" with an epigram from Martial, which gives him occasion to
speak of his classical education under the famed Dr Busby, of
Westminster School, where he learnt that wrestling was one of the five
great Olympian sports. When he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, he
noted, as a spectator of wrestling contests, the vast difference between
"the Norfolk Out-Players and the Cornish Huggers," and that the latter
could throw the other when they pleased. The use and application of
mathematics he learnt when an undergraduate, from his tutor Dr Bathurst,
but more especially from Sir Isaac Newton, who, seeing his inclination,
invited him to his public lectures, "though I was Fellow Commoner, and
seldom if ever any such were called to them." From Cambridge Sir Thomas
proceeded to Gray's Inn, and there learnt fencing and vaulting, and also
wrestling from Mr Cornish, who was his "Inn-Play Wrestling Master." He
committed to writing the great variety of holds that he was taught.
Out-Play wrestling is compared to French Fencing, and is the prettier to
look at, but "Inn-Play soon decidethe who is the better gamester by an
indisputable fall." "If wrestling," says Sir Thomas, "was more practic’d
by Gentlemen, few or none would be killed by the sword in rencounters,
but a severe fall or two, a black face or the like, would allay their
fury and heat for that time, nay perhaps till quite forgotten." He backs
up his preference for Cornish wrestling by the quaint suggestion that it
commended itself to the other sex. "For the most part our country rings
for wrestlings, at wakes and other festivals, consist of a small party
of young women, who come not thither to choose a coward, but the daring,
healthy and robust persons. . . . I ne’er could hear that the women
approved of the Norfolk Out-Play, the rending and tearing of waistcoats,
kicking and breaking of shins, and rendering them so tender they could
not endure to be rub’d, but that their inclinations were the strongest
for the Bedfordshire Inn-Play, and for such as approve themselves to be
good on the Cornish Close Hugg."

\* This enthusiastic champion of wrestling established annual matches in
his own park, the prize being a hat of the value of twenty-two
shillings. These

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

were continued for more than half a century after his death; they were
finally abandoned about 1810. It is recorded of him that he never knew a
day's illness until the time of his death, which occurred on March 29th,
1741. In addition to being a skilled athlete, Sir Thomas was of much
repute as a man of probity and learning, and was on the commission of
the peace for the counties of Nottingham and Leicester. He had his
monument erected in the chancel of Bunny church in his lifetime, whereon
his fame as a wrestler is set forth, and his effigy rudely carved, with
arms extended, in the first position of Cornish-hug. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_326.md)

\* During the nineteenth century wrestling revived from time to time,
but the rowdyism and roguery, so often associated with the matches, have
for the most part kept this sport in deserved disrepute.

HIPPAS.--The Greeks had a pastime called Hippas, which, we are told, was
one person riding upon the shoulders of another, as upon a horse; <span
id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_327.md) a sport of this kind was in practice
with us at the commencement of the fourteenth century, but generally
performed by two competitors who struggled one with the other, and he
who pulled his opponent from the shoulders of his carrier was the
victor.

The representations of this curious pastime on plate seven are taken
from different manuscripts; one in the Royal Library, <span
id="fr_328"></span>[3](#fn_328.md) and the other in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford, dated 1344. <span id="fr_329"></span>[4](#fn_329.md)

This seems to bear more analogy to wrestling than to any other sport,
for which reason I have given it a place in the present chapter.

SWIMMING.--Swimming is an exercise of great antiquity; and, no doubt,
familiar to the inhabitants of this country at all times. The heroes of
the middle ages are sometimes praised for their skill in swimming: it is
said of Olaf Fryggeson, a king of Norway, that he had no equal in his
art. <span id="fr_330"></span>[5](#fn_330.md) Peacham, describing the
requisites for a complete gentleman, mentions swimming as one; and
particularly recommends it to such as were inclined to follow a military
profession. In this he seems to have followed an old poetical
writer, <span id="fr_331"></span>[6](#fn_331.md) who speaks in this manner:

To swymme, is eke to lerne in sommer leson.  
Men fynde not a bridge, so often as a flood,  
Swymmyng to voyde; and chase an hoste wil eson.  
Eke after rayne the rivers goeth wood, <span
id="fr_332"></span>[7](#fn_332.md)  
That every man in t’host can swymme, is good:  
Knyght, squyer, footman, cook, and cosynere.  
And grome, and page, in swymmyng is to lere.

Meaning thereby, that the art of swimming ought to be learned by every
class

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

of persons belonging to an army: and, perhaps, it may not be improper to
add, by every other person also.

Swimming and diving are mentioned by the author of the Visions of Pierce
Ploughman <span id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_333.md) in the following
manner:--

Take two strong men and in Temese <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_334.md)
cast them,  
And both naked as a needle, ther non sikerer <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_335.md) than other;  
The one hath cunnynge and can swymme and dyve,  
The other is lewd of that laboure, lerned never to swym,  
Which trowest of these two in Temese is most in dred,  
He that never dived ne nought of swymmyng,  
Or the swymmer that is safe if he himself lyke?

\* The first printed book in the world published on swimming was issued
in 1 538; it is in Latin, and was written by N. Wymnan, professor of
languages at Ingoldstadt. The first treatise published in England was
that by Everard Digby in 1587; it is in Latin, and styled *De Arte
Natandi*. The numerous illustrations are most quaint. *The Compleat
Swimmer*, by William Pearcey Gent, was issued in 1658; it is a sad bit
of plagiarism, being a literal and unacknowledged translation of Digby's
work. Monsieur Thévenot's *Art of Swimming with advice for Bathers* was
issued in 1696, and translated into English in 1699; it has forty small
copperplate cuts showing the different postures. None of these works say
anything about the history of swimming in England.

Boys in the country usually learn to swim with bundles of bull-rushes,
and with corks where the rushes cannot readily be procured; particularly
in the neighbourhood of London, where we are told, two centuries back,
there were men who could teach the art of swimming well, and, says the
author, "for commoditie of river and water for that purpose, there is no
where better." <span id="fr_336"></span>[4](#fn_336.md)

I am sorry to add, that swimming is by no means so generally practised
with us in the present day as it used to be in former times. We have
several treatises on the art of swimming and diving, and in the
Encyclopædia Britannica are many excellent directions relating to it,
under the article Swimming. <span id="fr_337"></span>[5](#fn_337.md)

SLIDING.--Sliding upon the ice appears to have been a very favourite
pastime among the youth of this country in former times; at present the
use of skates is so generally diffused throughout the kingdom, that
sliding is but little practised, except by children, and such as cannot
afford to purchase them.

Sliding is one of the diversions ascribed to young men of London by
Fitzstephen, and, as far as one can judge from his description of the
sport, it differed not in the performance from the method used by the
boys of our own

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

time: but he adds another kind of pastime upon the ice that is not now
in practice; his words are to this effect, "Others make a seat of ice as
large as a millstone, and having placed one of their companions upon it,
they draw him along, when it sometimes happens that moving on slippery
places they all fall down headlong." Instead of these seats of ice,
among the moderns, sledges are used, which being extended from a centre,
by the means of a strong rope, those who are seated in them are moved
round with great velocity, and form an extensive circle. Sledges of this
kind were set upon the Thames during the hard frost, in the year 1716,
as the following couplet in a song written upon that occasion <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_338.md) plainly proves:

While the rabble in sledges run giddily round,  
And nought but a circle of folly is found.

SKATING.--Skating is by no means a recent pastime, and probably the
invention proceeded rather from necessity than the desire of amusement.

The wooden skates shod with iron or steel, which are bound about the
feet and ancles like the talares of the Greeks and Romans, were most
probably brought into England from the Low Countries, where they are
said to have originated, and where it is well known they are almost
universally used by persons of both sexes when the season permits. The
word itself is a proof that this pastime came to us from Holland, for
skate is not an old English word, but is borrowed from the Dutch
*schaats*. In Hoole's translation of the Vocabulary by Comenius, called
*Orbis Sensualium Pictus* (1658) the skates are called scrickshoes from
the German, and in the print at the head of the section, in that work,
they are represented longer than those of the present day, and the irons
are turned up much higher in the front.

\* Some antiquaries are of opinion that there was skating in England
even in prehistoric times, the earliest skates being those made from
bones. In January 1874 "two British skates" of bone, found at
Blackfriars, on the old bed of the Fleet river, were exhibited before
the British Archeological Association. In the following month two bone
skates, one polished and one in process of manufacture, found in the
city of London, were exhibited before the same association. Mr Loftus
Brock also exhibited in June of the same year "a fine bone skate about a
foot long with a flat polished surface, of prehistoric date," which had
been found in Bucklersbury, on the site of the ancient church of St
Benet Sherchog. <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_339.md)

"In 1841 Mr Roach Smith exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries a bone
skate which had been found in boggy ground in Moorfields, near Finsbury
Circus. He considered that it was one of those described as used in the
twelfth century on this very site. <span id="fr_340"></span>[3](#fn_340.md)
Fitzstephen, the chronicler of London in the time of Henry II.,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

says--"When that great moor which washed Moorfields, at the north wall
of the city, is frozen over, great companies of young men go to sport
upon the ice, and bind to their shoes bones, as the legs of some beasts;
and hold stakes in their hands, headed with sharp iron, which sometimes
they stick against the ice; and these men go on with speed, as doth a
bird in the air, or darts shot from some warlike engine. Sometimes two
men set themselves at a distance, and run one against another, as it
were at tilt, with these stakes; wherewith one or both parties are
thrown down, not without some hurt to their bodies; and after their
fall, by reason of their violent motion, are carried a good distance one
from another; and wheresoever the ice doth touch their heads, it rubs
off the skin and lays it bare; and if one fall upon his leg or arm, it
is usually broken; but young men, being greedy of honour and desirous of
victory, do thus exercise themselves in counterfeit battles that they
may bear the brunt more strongly when they come to it in good earnest."

\* The two great diarists of the Restoration period, Evelyn and Pepys,
both record skating feats that they witnessed on December 1st, 1662,
when this revived exercise on metal skates had been reintroduced
[from](errata.htm#0.md) Holland.

\* Evelyn says: "Having seen the strange and wonderful dexterity of the
sliders on the new canal in St James's Park, performed before their
Ma<sup>ties</sup> by divers gentlemen, and others with Scheetes after
the manner of the Hollanders, with what swiftnesse they passe, how
suddainely they stop in full carriere upon the ice, I went home by
water, but not without exceeding difficulties, the Thames being frozen,
greate flakes of ice incompassing our boate." Pepys' entry is as
follows: "St James's Park, Dec. 1, 1662. Over the Park, where I first in
my life, it being a great frost, did see people sliding with their
skeates, which is a very pretty art."

\* Little is recorded of the development of skating in England in the
eighteenth century, but illustrations of fairs held on the frozen Thames
in 1716 and in 1740 prove that it was popular at both those dates. The
first English "Treatise on Skating, Founded on certain Principles
deduced from many Years Experience" was printed in 1772. The author was
Robert Jones, Lieutenant of Artillery; it was dedicated to Lord Spencer
Hamilton as an expert on the ice. The writer expresses a strong
preference for English rather than Dutch skates, but acknowledges that
the latter are better for travelling. In England skating was only "an
exercise and diversion," whereas in Holland it was a "business and
necessity."

\* Roller skates are not the novelty that they are usually supposed to
be. Joseph Merlin, a native of Liege, who came to England with the
Spanish ambassador in 1760, invented a pair of skates that ran on
wheels. But his exhibition of them was not a success. Gliding about in
them at a masquerade at Carlisle House, Soho Square, he ran into a
valuable mirror worth £500, which he completely shattered in addition to
wounding himself severely. <span id="fr_341"></span>[1](#fn_341.md) A

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

patent for wheel skates was taken out in 1819; and the old tennis court
in Windmill Street was turned into a rink for roller skating in the year
1823. <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_342.md)

Some modern writers have asserted, that "the metropolis of Scotland has
produced more instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any other
country whatever, and the institution of a skating-club, about forty
years ago, has contributed not a little to the improvement of this
amusement. <span id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_343.md) I have, however, seen,
some years back, when the Serpentine river in Hyde Park was frozen over,
four gentlemen there dance, if I may be allowed the expression, a double
minuet in skates, with as much ease, and I think more elegance, than in
a ball room; others again, by turning and winding with much adroitness,
have readily in succession described upon the ice the form of all the
letters in the alphabet.

\* During the nineteenth century the development of English skating has
been most remarkable. <span id="fr_344"></span>[3](#fn_344.md)

ROWING.--I shall not pretend to investigate the antiquity of
boat-rowing. This art was certainly well understood by the primitive
inhabitants of Britain, who frequently committed themselves to the mercy
of the sea in open boats, constructed with wicker work, and covered with
leather. <span id="fr_345"></span>[4](#fn_345.md) The Saxons were also
expert in the management of the oar, and thought it by no means
derogatory for a nobleman of the highest rank to row or steer a boat
with dexterity and judgment. Kolson, a northern hero, boasting of his
qualifications, declares, that "he was expert in handling the
oar." <span id="fr_346"></span>[5](#fn_346.md) The reader may possibly call
to his recollection the popular story related by our historians
concerning Edgar, surnamed the Peaceable, who they tell us was conveyed
in great state along the river Dee, from his palace in the city of West
Chester, to the church of St John, and back again: the oars were managed
by eight kings, and himself, the ninth, sat at the stern of the barge
and held the helm. <span id="fr_347"></span>[6](#fn_347.md) This frolic,
for I cannot consider it in any other light, appears to be well
attested, and is the earliest record of a pastime of the kind.

The boat-quintain and tilting at each other upon the water, which were
introduced by the Normans as amusements for the summer season, <span
id="fr_348"></span>[7](#fn_348.md) could not be performed without the
assistance of the oars, and probably much of the success of the champion
depended upon the skilfulness of those who managed the boat. If we refer
to two engravings <span id="fr_349"></span>[8](#fn_349.md) whereon both
these sports are represented, we shall see that the rowers are seated
contrary to the usual method, and face the head of the vessel instead of
the stern.

The institution of the water pageantry at London upon the lord mayor's
day, was of an essential service to the professed watermen, who plied
about the bridge; and gave occasion to the introduction of many pleasure
buts, which in

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

the modern times have been greatly increased. The first procession to
Westminster by water was made A.D. 1453, by John Norman, then lord
mayor, for which he was highly commended by the watermen.

When tilting at the quintain and justing one against another in boats
upon the water were discontinued in this country, rowing matches were
substituted, and are become exceedingly popular: we may see them
frequently exhibited upon the Thames during the summer season; and as
these contests, which depend upon skill as well as upon strength, are
rarely productive of any thing further than mere pastime, they are in my
opinion deservedly encouraged. When a rowing-match takes place near
London, if the weather be fine, it is astonishing to see what crowds of
people assemble themselves upon the banks of the Thames as spectators,
and the river itself is nearly covered with wherries, pleasure boats,
and barges, decorated with flags and streamers, and sometimes
accompanied with bands of music. This pastime, though very ancient, and
frequently practised upon solemn occasions by the Greeks and the Romans,
does not seem to have attracted the notice of our countrymen in former
times.

It may be thought unnecessary for me to mention the well-known annual
legacy of Thomas Dogget, a comedian of some celebrity at the
commencement of the eighteenth century, which provides three prizes to
be claimed by three young watermen, on condition they prove victorious
in rowing from the Old Swan Stairs near London Bridge, to the White Swan
at Chelsea. The contest takes place upon the first of August; the number
of competitors upon this occasion is restricted to six, who must not
have been out of their times beyond twelve months. Every man rows singly
in his boat, and his exertions are made against the tide; he who first
obtains his landing at Chelsea receives the prize of honour, which is a
waterman's coat, ornamented with a large badge of silver, and therefore
the match is usually called "Rowing for the Coat and Badge." The second
and the third candidates have small pecuniary rewards, but the other
three get nothing for their trouble.

Of late years (1800) the proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens, and Astley the
rider, give each of them in the course of the summer a new wherry, to be
rowed for by a certain number of watermen, two of which are allowed to
row in one boat; and these contests are extended to two or three heats
or trials before the successful candidates are determined.

SAILING.--Another popular amusement upon the water is sailing, and many
persons have pleasure boats for this purpose; I do not mean the open
boats which are usually let out for hire by the boat-builders for the
purpose of sailing, but vessels of much greater magnitude, that are
covered with a deck, and able with skilful management to weather a rough
storm; many large bets are frequently dependent upon the swiftness of
these boats, and the contest is sometimes determined at sea.

A society, generally known by the appellation of the Cumberland Society,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

consisting of gentlemen partial to this pastime, give yearly a silver
cup to be sailed for in the vicinity of London. The boats usually start
from the bridge at Blackfriars, go up the Thames to Putney, and return
to Vauxhall, where a vessel is moored at a distance from the stairs, and
the sailing boat that first passes this mark upon her return obtains the
victory. <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_350.md)

Albert Hartshorne contributed to that paper a brief description and
sketch of what he terms "a complete and ancient example of a dumb-bell"
in the belfry of Bradbourne church, Derbyshire. This is, however, in
reality a mere windlass for bell raising such as can be found in scores
of old belfries. Having visited every Derbyshire belfry, and hundreds of
others, I have no doubt on the matter, and agree in this respect with
our best bell expert, Dr Raven. When first learning bell ringing the
practice always was and still obtains of simply tying back the clapper,
and so producing dumb bells.--J. C. C.

after Canon Atkinson published this book, one of my oldest parishioners
in Barton-le-Street (of which I was rector 1886.1894) told me that he
had seen a stark naked race of young men over the moors from
Danby-in-Cleveland churchyard at the conclusion of a wedding at which
Canon Atkinson officiated in the year 1851. Needless to say the sport
did not begin till after the parson had left. I had some most
interesting correspondence with the Canon on this subject, and was able
to convince him by the evidence of several that this occasional
stripping for a race after a wedding was only abandoned soon after he
entered on his incumbency.--J. C. C.

unnecessary to state that the art and pastime of swimming underwent a
remarkable revival during the nineteenth century. There can be but
little doubt that the proportion of the English population who can swim
is now (1903) far higher than it has ever been before. It is greatly
encouraged in schools.
