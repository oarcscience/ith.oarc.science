### CHAPTER IV

The Joculator--His different Denominations and extraordinary
Deceptions--His Performances ascribed to Magic--Asiatic
Jugglers--Remarkable Story from Froissart--Tricks of the Jugglers
ascribed to the Agency of the Devil; but more reasonably accounted
for--John Rykell, a celebrated Tregetour--Their various
Performances--Privileges of the Joculators at Paris--The King's
Joculator an Officer of Rank--The great Disrepute of modern Jugglers.

THE JOCULATOR.--The *joculator*, or the jugglour of the Normans, was
frequently included under the collective appellation of minstrel. His
profession originally was very comprehensive, and included the practice
of all the arts attributed to the minstrel; and some of the jugglers
were excellent tumblers. Joinville, in the *Life of St Louis and
Charpentier*, quotes an old author, who speaks of a joculator, *qui
sciebat tombare*. <span id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_605.md) He was called a
gleeman in the Saxon era, and answers to the juggler of the more modern
times. In the fourteenth century he was also denominated a *tregetour*,
or *tragetour*, at which time he appears to have been separated from the
musical poets, who exercised the first branches of the gleeman's art,
and are more generally considered as minstrels.

DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS OF THE JOCULATOR, AND HIS EXTRAORDINARY
DECEPTIONS.--The name of tregetours was chiefly, if not entirely,
appropriated to those artists who, by sleight of hand, with the
assistance of machinery of various kinds, deceived the eyes of the
spectators, and produced such illusions as were usually supposed to be
the effect of enchantment; for which reason they were frequently ranked
with magicians, sorcerers, and witches; and, indeed, the feats they
performed, according to the descriptions given of them, abundantly prove
that they were no contemptible practitioners in the arts of deception.
Chaucer, who, no doubt, had frequently an opportunity of seeing the
tricks exhibited by the tregetours in his time, says, "There I sawe
playenge jogelours, magyciens, trageteours, phetonysses, charmeresses,
olde witches, and sorceresses," etc. <span
id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_606.md) He speaks of them in a style that may
well excite astonishment: "There are," says he, "sciences by which men
can delude the eye with divers appearances, such as the subtil
tregetours perform at feasts. In a large hall they will produce water
with boats rowed up and down upon it." In the library of Sir Hans
Sloane, at the British Museum, is a MS <span
id="fr_607"></span>[3](#fn_607.md) which contains "an experiment to make
the appearance of a flode of water to come into a house." The directions
are, to steep a thread in the liquor produced from snakes' eggs bruised,
and to hang it up over a basin of water in the place where

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

the trick is to be performed. The tregetours, no doubt, had recourse to
a surer method. Chaucer goes on to say, "Sometimes they will bring in
the similitude of a grim lion, or make flowers spring up as in a meadow;
sometimes they cause a vine to flourish, bearing white and red grapes;
or show a castle built with stone; and when they please, they cause the
whole to disappear." He then speaks of "a learned clerk," who, for the
amusement of his friend, showed to him "forests full of wild deer, where
he saw an hundred of them slain, some with hounds and some with arrows;
the hunting being finished, a company of falconers appeared upon the
banks of a fair river, where the birds pursued the herons, and slew
them. He then saw knights justing upon a plain"; and, by way of
conclusion, "the resemblance of his beloved lady dancing; which
occasioned him to dance also." But, when "the maister that this magike
wrought thought fit, he clapped his hands together, and all was gone in
an instante." <span id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_608.md) Again, in another
part of his works, the same poet says:--

There saw I Coll Tregetour,  
Upon a table of sycamour,  
Play an uncouthe thynge to tell;  
I sawe hym cary a wynde-mell  
Under a walnote shale. <span id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_609.md)

THE JOCULATORS' PERFORMANCES ASCRIBED TO MAGIC.--Chaucer attributes
these illusions to the practice of natural magic. Thus the Squire, in
his Tale, says:--

An appearance made by some magyke,  
As jogglours playen at their festes grete.

And again, in the third book of the *House of Fame*:--

And clerkes eke which conne well  
All this magyke naturell.

\[paragraph continues\] Meaning, I suppose, an artful combination of
different powers of nature in a manner not generally understood; and
therefore he makes the Devil say to the Sompner in the Friar's Tale, "I
can take any shape that pleases me; of a man, of an ape, or of an angel;
and it is no wonder, a lousy juggler can deceive you; and I can assure
you my skill is superior to his." I need not say, that a greater
latitude was assigned to what the poet calls natural magic in his days,
than will be granted in the present time.

ASIATIC JUGGLERS.--Sir John Mandeville, who wrote about the same period
as Chaucer, speaks thus of a similar exhibition performed before the
Great Chan: "And then comen jogulours, and enchauntours, that doen many
marvaylles"; for they make, says he, the appearance of the sun and the
moon in the air; and then they make the night so dark, that nothing can
be seen; and again they restore the daylight, with the sun shining
brightly; then they "bringen-in daunces, of the fairest damsels of the
world, and the richest arrayed"; afterwards they make other damsels to
come in, bringing cups of gold, full of the milk of

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

divers animals, and give drink to the lords and ladies; and then "they
make knyghts jousten in armes fulle lustily," who run together, and in
the encounter break their spears so rudely, that the splinters fly all
about the hall. <span id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_610.md) They also bring in
a hunting of the hart and of the boar, with hounds running at them
open-mouthed; and many other things they do by the craft of their
enchantments, that are "marvellous to see." In another part he says,
"And be it done by craft, or by nicromancy, I wot not." <span
id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_611.md)

REMARKABLE STORY FROM FROISSART.--The foregoing passages bring to my
recollection a curious piece of history related by Froissart, which
extends the practice of these deceptions far beyond the knowledge of the
modern jugglers. When, says that author, the duke of Anjou and the earl
of Savoy were lying with their army before the city of Naples, there was
"an enchaunter, a conning man in nigromancy, in the Marches of Naples."
This man promised to the duke of Anjou, that he would put him in
possession of the castle of Leufe, at that time besieged by him. The
duke was desirous of knowing by what means this could be effected; and
the magician said, "I shall, by enchauntment, make the ayre so thicke,
that they within the castell will think there is a great brydge over the
sea, large enough for ten men a-breast to come to them; and when they
see this brydge, they will readily yeilde themselves to your mercy,
least they should be taken perforce." And may not my men, said the duke,
pass over this bridge in reality? To this question the juggler artfully
replied, "I dare not, syr, assure you that; for, if any one of the men
that passeth on the brydge shall make the sign of the cross upon him,
all shall go to noughte, and they that be upon it shall fall into the
sea." The earl of Savoy was not present at this conference; but being
afterwards made acquainted with it, he said to the duke, "I know well it
is the same enchaunter, by whom the queene of Naples and syr Othes of
Bresugeth were taken in this castle; for he caused, by his crafte, the
sea to seeme so high, that they within were sore abashed, and wend all
to have died; but no confidence," continued he, "ought to be placed in a
fellow of this kind, who has already betrayed the queen for hire; and
now, for the sake of another reward, is willing to give up the man whose
bounty he has received." The earl then commanded the enchanter to be
brought before him; when he boasted that, by the power of his art, he
had caused the castle to be delivered to Sir Charles de la Paye, who was
then in possession of it; and concluded his speech with these words:
"Syr, I am the man of the world that syr Charles reputeth most, and is
most in fear of." "By my fayth," replied the earl of Savoy, "ye say
well; and I will that syr Charles shall know that he hath great wrong to
feare you: but I shall assure hym of you, for ye shal never do more
enchauntments to deceyve hym, nor yet any other." So saying, he ordered
him to be beheaded; and the sentence was instantly put into execution
before the door of the earl's tent. "Thus," adds our author, "ended the
mayster enchantour: and so he was payed hys wages according to his
desertes." <span id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_612.md)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

TRICKS OF THE JUGGLERS ASCRIBED TO INFERNAL AGENCY; BUT MORE REASONABLY
ACCOUNTED FOR.--Our learned monarch James I. was perfectly convinced
that these, and other inferior feats exhibited by the tregetours, could
only be performed by the agency of the Devil, "who," says he, "will
learne them many juglarie tricks, at cardes and dice, to deceive men's
senses thereby, and such innumerable false practiques, which are proved
by over-many in this age." <span id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_613.md) It is
not, however, very easy to reconcile with common sense the knowledge the
king pre-tended to have had of the intercourse between Satan and his
scholars the conjurers; unless his majesty had been, what nobody, I
trust, suspects him to have been, one of the fraternity. But,
notwithstanding the high authority of a crowned head in favour of
Beelzebub, it is the opinion of some modern writers, that the tricks of
the jugglers may be accounted for upon much more reasonable, as well as
more natural, principles. These artists were greatly encouraged in the
middle ages; they travelled in large companies, and carried with them,
no doubt, such machinery as was necessary for the performance of their
deceptions; and we are all well aware, that very surprising things may
be exhibited through the medium of a proper apparatus, and with the
assistance of expert confederates. A magic lanthorn will produce
appearances almost as wonderful as some of those described by Sir John
Mandeville, to persons totally ignorant of the existence and nature of
such a machine. The principles of natural philosophy were very little
known in those dark ages; and, for that reason, the spectators were more
readily deceived. In our own times we have had several exhibitions that
excited much astonishment; such as an image of wax, suspended by a
ribband in the middle of a large room, which answered questions in
various languages; an automaton chess-player, that few professors of the
game could beat; <span id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_614.md) and men ascending
the air without the assistance of wings: yet these phenomena are
considered as puerile, now the secrets upon which their performance
depends have been divulged. But, returning to the tregetour, we shall
find that he often performed his feats upon a scaffold erected for that
purpose; and probably, says a late ingenious writer, <span
id="fr_615"></span>[3](#fn_615.md) received his name from the *trebuchet*,
or trap-door, because he frequently made use of such insidious machines
in the displayment of his operations. Chaucer has told us, that Coll the
tregetour exhibited upon a table; and other authors speak of "juggling
upon the boardes," which clearly indicates the use of a stage or
temporary scaffold. Now, let us only add the machinery proper for the
occasion, and all the wonders specified in the foregoing passages may be
reduced to mere pantomimical deceptions, assisted by sleight of hand,
and the whole readily accounted for without any reference to
supernatural agency.

JOHN RYKELL, A CELEBRATED TREGETOUR.--In the fourteenth century, the
tregetours seem to have been in the zenith of their glory; from that
period they gradually declined in the popular esteem; their performances
were more confined,

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

and of course became less consequential. Lydgate, in one of his
poems, <span id="fr_616"></span>[1](#fn_616.md) introduces Death speaking
to a famous tregetour belonging to the court of king Henry V. in this
manner:--

Maister John Rykell, sometime tregitour  
  Of noble Henry kinge of Englonde,  
And of France the mighty conqueror;  
  For all the sleightes, and turnyng of thyne honde,  
Thou must come nere this dance, I understonde;  
  Nought may avail all thy conclusions,  
For Dethe shortly, nother on see nor land,  
  Is not desceyved by no illusions.

To this summons the sorrowful juggler replies:--

What may availe mankynde naturale?  
  Not any crafte schevid by apparance,  
Or course of steres above celestial,  
  Or of heavens all the influence,  
Ageynst Deth to stonde at defence.  
  Lygarde-de-mayne now helpith me right noughte:  
Farewell, my craft and all such sapience;  
  For Deth hath mo masteries than I have wroughte.

In "The Disobedient Child," an old morality, or interlude, written by
Thomas Ingeland in the reign of queen Elizabeth, a servant, describing
the sports at his master's wedding, says:--

What juggling was there upon the boardes!  
  What thrusting of knyves through many a nose!  
What bearynge of formes! what holdinge of swordes!  
  What puttynge of botkyns throughe legge and hose! <span
id="fr_617"></span>[2](#fn_617.md)

These tricks approximate nearly to those of the modern jugglers, who
have knives so constructed, that, when they are applied to the legs, the
arms, and other parts of the human figure, they have the appearance of
being thrust through them; the bearing of the forms, or seats, I
suppose, was the balancing of them; and the holding of swords, the
flourishing them about in the sword-dance; which the reader will find
described in the succeeding chapter.

VARIOUS PERFORMANCES OF THE JOCULATORS.--Originally, as we have before
observed, the profession of the joculator included all the arts
attributed to the minstrels; and accordingly his performance was called
his minstrelsy in the reign of Edward II., and even after he had
obtained the appellation of a tregetour. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[3](#fn_618.md) We are well assured, that playing upon
the vielle and the harp, and singing of songs, verses, and poems taken
from popular stories; together with dancing, tumbling, and other feats
of agility, formed a principal part of the joculator's occupation at the
commencement of the thirteenth century; and

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

probably so they might in the days of Chaucer. Another part of the
juggler's profession, and which constituted a prominent feature in his
character, was teaching bears, apes, monkeys, dogs, and various other
animals, to tumble, dance, and counterfeit the actions of men; but we
shall have occasion to enlarge upon this subject a few pages farther on.

In a book of customs, says St Foix, <span
id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_619.md) made in the reign of Saint Louis, for
the regulation of the duties to be paid upon the little chatelet at the
entrance into Paris, we read, that a merchant, who brought apes to sell,
should pay four deniers; but, if an ape belonged to a joculator, this
man, by causing the animal to dance in the presence of the toll-man, was
privileged to pass duty-free, with all the apparatus necessary for his
performances: hence came the proverb, "Pay in money; the ape pays in
gambols." Another article specifies that the joculator might escape the
payment of the toll by singing a couplet of a song before the collector
of the duty.

Comenius, I take it, has given us a proper view of the juggler's
exhibition, as it was displayed a century and a half back, in a short
chapter entitled Prestigiæ, or Sleights. <span
id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_620.md) It consists of four divertisements,
including the joculator's own performances; and the other three are
tumbling and jumping through a hoop; the grotesque dances of the clown,
or mimic, who, it is said, appeared with a mark upon his face; and
dancing upon the tight rope. The print at the head of his chapter is
made agreeably to the English custom, and differs a little from the
original description. In the latter it is said, "The juggler sheweth
sleights out of a purse." In the print there is no purse represented;
but the artist is practising with cups and balls in the manner they are
used at present. The tumbler is walking upon his hands. The rope-dancing
is performed by a woman holding a balancing pole; and on the same rope a
man, probably "clown to the rope," is represented hanging by one leg
with his head downwards. In modern times, the juggler has united songs
and puppet-plays to his show.

PRIVILEGES OF THE JOCULATORS AT PARIS--THE KINGS JOCULATOR.--The
*joculalor regis*, or king's juggler, was anciently an officer of note
in the royal household; and we find, from Domesday Book (under
Gloucestershire) that Berdic, who held that office in the reign of the
Conqueror, was a man of property. <span id="fr_621"></span>[3](#fn_621.md)
In the succeeding century, or soon afterwards, the title of rex
juglatorum, or king of the jugglers, was conferred upon the chief
performer of the company, and the rest, I presume, were under his
control. The king's juggler continued to have an establishment in the
royal household till the time of Henry VIII.; <span
id="fr_622"></span>[4](#fn_622.md) and in his reign the office and title
seem to have been discontinued.

GREAT DISREPUTE OF MODERN JUGGLERS.--The profession of the juggler,

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

with that of the minstrel, had fallen so low in the public estimation at
the close of the reign of queen Elizabeth, that the performers were
ranked, by the moral writers of the time, not only with "ruffians,
blasphemers, thieves, and vagabonds"; but also with "Heretics, Jews,
Pagans, and sorcerers"; <span id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_623.md) and,
indeed, at an earlier period they were treated with but little more
respect, as appears from the following lines in Barclay's Eclogues:

Jugglers and pipers, bourders and flatterers,  
Baudes and janglers, and cursed adouteres. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[2](#fn_624.md)

\[paragraph continues\] In another passage, he speaks of a disguised
juggler, and a vile jester or bourder; <span
id="fr_625"></span>[3](#fn_625.md) by the word disguised he refers,
perhaps, to the clown, or mimic; who, as Comenius has just informed us,
danced "disguised with a vizard." In more modern times, by way of
derision, the juggler was called a hocus-pocus, <span
id="fr_626"></span>[4](#fn_626.md) a term applicable to a pick-pocket, or a
common cheat.

mention I have found of this term. It occurs again in the *Seven
Champions*, by John Kirk, acted in 1663: "My mother could juggle as well
as any hocus-pocus in the world."

\* Murray's *Dictionary* says that this term as the appellation of a
juggler, and apparently as the assumed name of a particular conjurer,
appears early in the seventeenth century, and was derived from the sham
Latin formula employed by him. Ady's *Candle in Dark* (1655) is
cited:--"I will speak of one man . . . that went about in king James his
time who called himself The Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus,
and so was called, because that at the playing of every Trick, he used
to say *Hocus pocus, toutus taloutus, vade celeriter jubeo*, a dark
composure of words, to blinde the eyes of the beholders, to make his
Trick pass the more currantly without discovery." Tillotson (Sermon
xxvi.) in 1742 is responsible for the highly improbable and irreverent
suggestion that Hocus-pocus is a corruption of *Hoc est Corpus* of the
Mass. *Hocus* apparently is responsible for originating the later word
*hoax*, that is to play a trick upon any one.
