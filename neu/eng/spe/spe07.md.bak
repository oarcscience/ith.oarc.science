### CHAPTER III

Horse-racing known to the Saxons--Races in Smithfield, and why--Races,
at what Seasons practised--The Chester Races--Stamford Races--Value of
Running-horses--Highly prized by the Poets, etc.--Horse-racing commended
as a liberal Pastime--Charles II. and other monarchs encouragers of
Horse-racing--Races on Coleshill-heath--Corporation Races and later.

HORSE-RACING KNOWN TO THE SAXONS.--It was requisite in former times for
a man of fashion to understand the nature and properties of horses, and
to ride well; or, using the words of an old romance writer, "to runne
horses and to approve them." <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201.md) In
proportion to the establishment of this maxim, swift running-horses of
course rose into estimation; and we know that in the ninth century they
were considered as presents well worthy the acceptance of kings and
princes.

When Hugh, the head of the house of the Capets, afterwards monarchs of
France, solicited the hand of Edelswitha, the sister of Athelstan, he
sent to that prince, among other valuable presents, several
running-horses, <span id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_202.md) with their saddles
and their bridles, the latter being embellished with bits of yellow
gold. It is hence concluded, and indeed with much appearance of truth,
that horse-racing was known and practised by the Anglo-Saxons, but most
probably confined to persons of rank and opulence, and practised only
for amusement sake.

RACES IN SMITHFIELD.--The first indication of a sport of this kind
occurs in the description of London, written by Fitzstephen, who lived
in the reign of Henry II. He tells us, that horses were usually exposed
for sale in West Smithfield; and, in order to prove the excellency of
the most valuable hackneys and charging steeds, they were matched
against each other; his words are to this effect, <span
id="fr_203"></span>[3](#fn_203.md) "When a race is to be run by this sort
of horses, and perhaps by others, which also in their kind are strong
and fleet, a shout is immediately raised, and the common horses are
ordered to withdraw out of the way. Three jockeys, or sometimes only
two, as the match is made, prepare themselves for the contest; such as
being used to ride know how to manage their horses with judgment: the
grand point is, to prevent a competitor from getting before them. The
horses, on their part, are not without emulation: they tremble and are
impatient, and are continually in motion: at last the signal once given,
they strike, devour the course, hurrying along with unremitting
velocity. The jockeys, inspired with the thoughts of applause and the
hopes of victory,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

clap spurs to their willing horses, brandish their whips, and cheer them
with their cries."

HORSE-RACING SEASONS.--In the middle ages there were certain seasons of
the year when the nobility indulged themselves in running their horses
and especially in the Easter and Whitsuntide holidays. In the old
metrical romance of "Sir Bevis of Southampton," <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_204.md) it is said,

In somer at Whitsontyde,  
Whan knightes most on horsebacke ride;  
A cours, let they make on a daye,  
Steedes, and Palfraye, for to assaye  
Whiche horse, that best may ren,  
Three myles the cours was then,  
Who that might ryde him shoulde  
Have forty pounds of redy golde.

Commenius in his vocabulary, entitled "Orbis Sensuallum Pictus,"
published towards the conclusion of the sixteenth century, indeed says,
"At this day, tilting, or the quintain is used, where a ring is struck
with a truncheon, instead of horse-races, which," adds he, "are grown
out of use."

A writer of the seventeenth century <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_205.md) tells us, that horse-racing, which had
formerly been practised at Eastertide, "was then put down, as being
contrary to the holiness of the season"; but for this prohibition I have
no further authority."

CHESTER RACES.--It is certain, that horse-races were held upon various
holidays, at different parts of the kingdom, and in preference to other
pastimes. "It had been customary," says a Chester antiquary, <span
id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_206.md) "time out of mind, upon Shrove Tuesday,
for the company of saddlers belonging to the city of Chester, to present
to the drapers a wooden ball, embellished with flowers, and placed upon
the point of a lance; this ceremony was performed in the presence of the
mayor, at the cross in the 'Rodhee,' or Roody, an open place near the
city; but this year" (1540), continues he, "the ball was changed into a
bell of silver, valued at three shillings and sixpence, or more, to be
given to him who shall run the best, and the farthest on horseback,
before them upon the same day." <span id="fr_207"></span>[4](#fn_207.md)
These bells were afterwards denominated Saint George's bells; and we are
told that in the last year of James I. John Brereton, inn-keeper, mayor
of Chester, first caused the horses entered for this race, then called
Saint George's race, to start from the point, beyond the new tower: and
appointed them to run five times round the Roody: "and he," says my
author, <span id="fr_208"></span>[5](#fn_208.md) "who won the last course
or trayne, received the bell, of a good value, of eight or ten pounds,
or thereabout, and to have it forever; which moneyes were collected of
the citizens, to a sum for that purpose." <span
id="fr_209"></span>[6](#fn_209.md) By the author's having added, that the
winner at this race was to have the bell, and have it for ever, is
implied, that it had formerly been

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

used as a temporary mark of honour, by the successful horseman, and
afterwards returned to the corporation; this alteration was made April
23, A.D. 1624.

Here we see the commencement of a regular horse-race, but whether the
courses were in immediate succession, or at different intervals, is not
perfectly clear; we find not, however, the least indication of distance
posts, weighing the riders, loading them with weights, and many other
niceties that are observed in the present day. The Chester races were
instituted merely for amusement, but now such prodigious sums are
usually dependent upon the event of a horse-race, that these apparently
trivial matters, are become indispensably necessary. Forty-six years
afterwards, <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210.md) according to the same
writer, the sheriffs of Chester "would have no calves-head feast, but
put the charge of it into a piece of plate, to be run for on that day,
Shrove Tuesday; and the high-sheriff borrowed a Barbary horse of sir
Thomas Middleton, which won him the plate; and being master of the race,
he would not suffer the horses of master Massey, of Puddington, and of
sir Philip Egerton, of Oulton, to run, because they came the day after
the time prefixed for the horses to be brought, and kept in the city;
which thing caused all the gentry to relinquish our races ever since."

\* Two small silver racing bells, belonging to the corporation of
Carlisle, of globular form, were exhibited before the Royal
Archæological Institute in 1879. The largest, which is 2¼ inches in
diameter, is gilt, and thus inscribed--"The sweftes hors thes bel to tak
for mi lade Daker sake." The other bears date 1599, with initials H. B.
M. C., that is, Henry Baines, Mayor of Carlisle. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211.md)

STAMFORD RACES.--Races something similar to those above mentioned, are
described by Butcher, <span id="fr_212"></span>[3](#fn_212.md) as practised
in the vicinity of the town of Stamford, in Lincolnshire. "A concourse,"
says he, "of noblemen and gentlemen meet together, in mirth, peace, and
amity, for the exercise of their swift running-horses, every Thursday in
March. The prize they run for is a silver and gilt cup, with a cover, to
the value of seven or eight pounds, provided by the care of the alderman
for the time being; but the money is raised out of the interest of a
stock formerly made up by the nobility and gentry, which are neighbours,
and well-wishers to the town."

VALUE OF RUNNING-HORSES.--Running-horses are frequently mentioned in the
registers of the royal expenditures. It is notorious, that king John was
so fond of swift horses and dogs for the chase, that he received many of
his fines in the one or the other; but at the same time it does not
appear that he used the horses for any purposes of pleasure, beyond the
pursuits of hunting, hawking, and such like sports of the field.

In the reign of Edward III. the running-horses purchased for the king's
service, were generally estimated at twenty marks, or thirteen pounds,
six shillings, and eightpence each; but some few of them were prized as
high as

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

twenty-five marks. <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) I met with an
entry, dated the ninth year of this king's reign, which states, that the
king of Navarre sent him as a present two running-horses, which I
presume were very valuable, because he gave the person who brought them
no less than one hundred shillings for his reward. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214.md)

RUNNING-HORSES OF THE HEROES OF ROMANCE.--If we appeal to the poets, we
shall find, that swift running-horses were greatly esteemed by the
heroes who figure in their romances; and rated at prodigious prices; for
instance, in an ancient poem, <span id="fr_215"></span>[3](#fn_215.md)
which celebrates the warlike actions of Richard I., it is said, that in
the camp of the emperor, as he is called, of Cyprus,

Too stedes fownde kinge Richarde,  
Thatt oon Favell, thatt other Lyard:  
Yn this worlde, they hadde no pere;  
Dromedary, neither destrere, <span id="fr_216"></span>[4](#fn_216.md)  
Stede, rabyte, ne cammele,  
Goeth none so swyfte without fayle  
For a thousand pownd of golde,  
Ne sholde the one be solde.

\[paragraph continues\] And though the rhymist may be thought to have
claimed the poetical licence for exaggeration, respecting the value of
these two famous steeds, the statement plainly indicates that in his
time there were horses very highly prized on account of their swiftness.
We do not find indeed, that they were kept for the purpose of racing
only, as horses are in the present day; but rather, as I before
observed, for hunting and other purposes of a similar nature; and also
to be used by heralds and messengers in cases of urgency.

Race-horses were prized on account of their breed, in the time of
Elizabeth, as appears from the following observations in one of Bishop
Hall's Satires.

                          -------dost thou prize  
Thy brute beasts worth by their dams qualities?  
Say’st thou this colt shall prove a swift pac’d steed,  
Onely because a Jennet did him breed?  
Or say’st thou this same horse shall win the prize,  
Because his dam was swiftest Trunchefice  
Or Runcevall his syre; himself a gallaway?  
While like a tireling jade, he lags half away. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[5](#fn_217.md)

HORSE-RACING, A LIBERAL PASTIME.--TWO centuries back horse-racing was
considered as a liberal pastime, practised for pleasure rather that
profit, without the least idea of reducing it to a system of gambling.
It is ranked with hunting and hawking, and opposed to dice and card
playing by an old Scotch poet, who laments that the latter had in great
measure superseded the former. <span id="fr_218"></span>[6](#fn_218.md) One
of the puritanical writers <span id="fr_219"></span>[7](#fn_219.md) in the
reign of Elizabeth, though he is very severe against cards, dice, vain
plays, interludes, and other idle pastimes, allows

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

of horse-racing as "yielding good exercise," which he certainly would
not have done, had it been in the least degree obnoxious to the censure
which at present it so justly claims.

Burton, <span id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) who wrote at the decline
of the seventeenth century, says sarcastically, "Horse-races are
desports of great men, and good in themselves, though many gentlemen by
such means gallop quite out of their fortunes"; which may be considered
as a plain indication, that they had begun to be productive of mischief
at the time he wrote: and fifty years afterwards, they were the occasion
of a new and destructive species of gambling. The following lines are
from a ballad in D’Urfey's collection of songs: it is called "New
Market," which place was then famous for the exhibition of horse-races.

Let collies that lose at a race  
Go venture at hazard to win,  
Or he that is bubbl’d at dice  
Recover at cocking again;  
Let jades that are founder’d be bought,  
Let jockeys play crimp to make sport.--  
------Another makes racing a trade,  
And dreams of his projects to come;  
And many a crimp match has made,  
By bubbing another man's groom. <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_221.md)

ROYAL PATRONS OF HORSE-RACING--RACES ON COLESHILL HEATH, &C.--From what
has been said, it seems clear enough, that this pastime was originally
practised in England for the sake of the exercise, or by way of
emulation, and, generally speaking, the owners of the horses were the
riders. These contests, however, attracted the notice of the populace,
and drew great crowds of people together to behold them; which induced
the inhabitants of many towns and cities to affix certain times for the
performance of such sports, and prizes were appointed as rewards for the
successful candidates. The prize was usually a silver cup or some other
piece of plate, about eight or ten pounds value.

In the reign of James I. public races (as distinguished from private
matches between gentlemen) were established in many parts of the
kingdom, such as Gathorty, Yorkshire; Croydon, Surrey, and on Enfield
Chase. It is said that the discipline and modes of preparing the horses
upon such occasions, were much the same as are practised in the present
day. The races were then called bell courses, because, as we have seen
above, the prize was a silver bell.

At the latter end of the reign of Charles I. races were held in Hyde
Park, and at Newmarket. After the Restoration, horse-racing was revived
and much encouraged by Charles II. who frequently honoured this pastime
with his presence; and, for his own amusement, when he resided at
Windsor, appointed races to be made in Datchet mead. At Newmarket, where
it is said he entered horses and run them in his name, he established a
house for his better accommodation;

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

and he also occasionally visited other places where horse-races were
instituted. I met with the following doggerel verses in a metrical
Itinerary, written at the close of the seventeenth century. The
author, <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222.md) for he hardly deserves the
name of poet, speaking of Burford Downs, makes these remarks:

Next for the glory of the place,  
Here has been rode many a race,--  
--King Charles the Second I saw here;  
But I've forgotten in what year.  
The duke of Monmouth here also,  
Made his horse to swete and blow;  
Lovelace, Pembrook, and other gallants  
Have been ventring here their talents,  
And Nicholas Bainton on black Sloven,  
Got silver plate by labor and drudging, &c.

At this time it seems, that the bells were converted into cups, or
bowls, or some other pieces of plate, which were usually valued at one
hundred guineas each; and upon these trophies of victory the exploits
and pedigree of the successful horses were most commonly engraved.
William III. was also a patroniser of this pastime, and established an
academy for riding, and his queen not only continued the bounty of her
predecessors, but added several plates to the former donations.

\* Queen Anne not only continued this practice, but kept a racing stud
and ran horses in her own name. At York, in 1712 the Queen's grey
gelding, Pepper, ran for the Royal Gold Cup, value £100; and Mustard,
described as a nutmeg-grey horse, another of the Queen's stud, ran for
the same stake in the following year. On Friday, July 30th, 1714, the
Queen's bay horse Star won a plate of £40 on the York course. On the
following Monday, during a race for a gold cup with a sweepstake of
sixteen guineas, an express arrived with the news of her majesty's
death. The nobility and gentry left the course and attended the
Archbishop of York and the Lord Mayor of York, who proclaimed the
accession of George I. <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_223.md) Towards the
close of his reign George I. discontinued the plates and gave in lieu
one hundred guineas.

In one of the Spectators, we meet with the following advertisement,
extracted, as we are told, from a paper called the Post Boy: <span
id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224.md) "On the ninth of October next will be
run for on Coleshill Heath, in Warwickshire, a plate of six guineas
value, three heats, by any horse, mare, or gelding, that hath not won
above the value of five pounds: the winning horse to be sold for ten
pounds, to carry ten stone weight if fourteen hands high: if above, or
under, to carry or be allowed weight for inches, and to be entered on
Friday the fifth, at the Swan, in Coleshill, by six in the evening. Also
a plate of less value, to be run for by asses"; which, though by no
means so noble a sport as the other, was, I doubt not, productive of the
most mirth.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

\* CORPORATION PLATES.--It was the custom of several of our more
important corporations to support horse-racing by presenting money or
money's worth. Horse-racing on Harleston Heath, near Northampton, was
established early in the seventeenth century. In 1632 the corporation of
Northampton covenanted to make an annual gift of a silver-gilt covered
cup of the value of £16, 13s. 4d. The Chamberlain's accounts for the
seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries always contain an
entry for this payment, generally characterised as "the horse-race
plate," and sometimes as "the Harleston race cup." In the reign,
however, of George II., the Duke of Marlborough made good his claim to
Harleston Heath against the Corporation, and those races ceased. At
certain times the Northampton corporation also supported the town races
held on their common fields. The earliest entry to this effect is
curiously enough in the time of the Commonwealth. In 1658, "at the
desire of the Country Gentlemen," two plates were provided, one of the
value of £30 and the other of £14. <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225.md)

\* In 1727 John Chency printed "an historical list of all the
horse-matches run, and all Plates and Prizes run for in England and
Wales (of the value of Ten Pounds or upwards.)" This list shows that
there were no fewer than one hundred and twelve cities and towns in
England and five in Wales where horse-races were held. To this work
succeeded Weatherby's well-known "Racing Calendar."
