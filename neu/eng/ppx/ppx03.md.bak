# Introduction

### Dartmoor described.--The Pixies said to make it their Haunt.--What they are supposed to be, and what they do.

IN this most pleasant part of England, the county of Devon, we have many
hills and rivers, with plenty of woods, and fields, and birds, and
flowers. And we have a large tract of country called Dartmoor, where the
hills are so high that some of them are like mountains, with a number of
beautiful sparkling streams and waterfalls, and a great many rocks, some
standing alone, and others piled on the top of the heights in such an
odd way, that they look like the ruins of castles and towers built by
the giants in the olden time, and these are called Tors; they are so
lofty that the clouds often hang upon them and hide their heads. And
what with its being so large and lonely, and its having no trees, except
in one or two spots near a river, Dartmoor is altogether, though a wild,
a very grand place.

In going from Tavistock to Exeter, persons sometimes cross the moor,
where there is now a good road, but it is so dreary and solitary, that
you may travel for miles and only here and there see a hut of the very
poorest kind, built of turf dug on the spot, and thatched with green
rushes, so that at a little distance it looks like the ground on which
it stands. The people who live in these humble dwellings are not very
nice, for the pig-stye is generally near the door, and the children are
not much cleaner than the pigs. It is the more discreditable to their
mothers to let them be so, as there is water enough around to wash and
keep clean all the children in Devonshire.

Corn can only be made to grow in a few scanty patches on Dartmoor, but
there is plenty of grass between the rocks and stones, and on this sheep
and oxen feed in great numbers. Many horses and young colts are also
there sent to pasture, and there run about and gambol, with their manes
and tails flowing and whisking about to keep off the flies (which are
abundant), in the most frolicksome manner; and even the poorest have a
donkey, that feeds near their huts.

The poor burn peat instead of wood or coal; and this useful kind of fuel
is nothing more than decayed turf dug out of the surrounding bogs. It is
cut in long pieces and dried, and then piled up, the one piece upon the
other, till it becomes a large heap, which at a little distance looks
not unlike a tent, and when several of them are seen standing together,
they remind the traveller of a camp. This peat is principally sold to
cottagers and farmers for fuel; and when it is carried to market, it is
not taken in a cart, but put on what is called a crook, which is made of
wood, in, shape something like the prongs of a pitchfork turned upward,
and when placed upon the back of a horse or donkey, it holds, piled upon
it, a great load.

The moor, being very hot in summer, abounds with adders or vipers, that
creep under the stones and hide in the long grass; and the men, when at
work, bind ropes of straw round their legs to save themselves from the
bite of these venomous reptiles. The farmers hang boughs of ash-tree
twisted round the necks of their cattle, believing that it will save
them from being harmed by the adders; but it is of no use, as they are
often sadly bitten.

There are a great many low walls, built of loose stones, to hinder the
cattle from straying; for if any of them attempt to jump over, the
stones not being fastened come tumbling down, and frighten them
terribly. The rocks consist of a very hard stone called granite, which
is quarried out and cut into blocks; and these are sent by a rude
railway to Plymouth, where they are shipped off to London and elsewhere,
to be used for building houses, churches, bridges, etc. The famous
Waterloo bridge was partly built of the granite from Dartmoor.

The rocks are useful in another way also; for on them grows a sort of
grey moss, which in the autumn produces a beautiful little red flower,
not so big as a red berry from the holly tree; and this moss is gathered
and sold to the dyer, with which he dyes woollen cloth a bright scarlet;
and many boys and girls have coats and frocks made out of the cloth so
dyed.

I do not know a prettier sight than to watch the rivers and streams of
Dartmoor, as they rush along strong and rapid; and every now and then
fall over great masses of rock in a sheet of white foam, or in a number
of little bright cascades. And when they pass on in a more quiet way,
the water is so clear you may see every stone beneath it; and several of
the rocks standing in the middle or at the sides of these streams, are
often quite covered with moss and what is called *lichens.* These are of
various colours; white, green, grey, or of the deepest black, like a
piece of rich black velvet. And it is very pretty, too, here to see the
water-wagtail, a nice little bird with white and grey feathers, skimming
over the rocks, shaking his tail up and down, dipping his wings into the
stream and off again in a moment.

On Dartmoor, too, as I have noticed in a previous work,  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) we meet in spring, upon a sunny morning, the
pale yellow butterfly, usually seen in the garden among the flower beds;
but here sporting on the front of some old grey rock, or settling on the
wild thyme, or on the golden furze, as its wings shake with a quickness
that will sometimes dazzle the sight.

And how beautiful is the song of the birds that we often find on the
moor! The thrush, that never tires; or the lark, which sings first and
soars highest; and the pretty wheatear that builds her nest amongst the
old rocks, whose colour it so resembles in the black and grey of its
wings, that you sometimes do not observe it perched upon them till you
hear its small cry. There, too, is the goshawk, so rare in Devon; and
the kite, that now is seldom found in its inhabited valleys, still
prowls, like a robber, about the moor, as if in search of his prey; and
the ring-ouzel finds a dwelling in the hollows of the stones, and the
poor little reed-wren makes them her home: and robin, that favourite of
old and young, there need fear no pilferer; for so much is this pretty
bird the familiar friend of children in our neighbourhood, that the boys
will pelt any one of their companions who may steal but an egg from poor
robin's nest.

But though there are so many pleasant sights, yet the moor has its
dangers. Those very high hills and lofty tors are liable to be visited
with sudden mists which are as thick as the clouds; and so hide every
thing, that I have known persons when seated in a carriage and caught in
one of these say, that they could not plainly see the heads of the
horses which drew them along. It is sad to think how many poor people in
old times before the good broad road was made, lost their lives on the
moor in these mists; some by wandering about all night in the cold, and
others by getting into bogs and being swallowed up alive before help
could be given them.

Many years ago, a very remarkable instance occurred of a native of this
place, the late Mr. Edward Smith, being enveloped inn mist, whilst
endeavouring to make his way (from a stream where he had been fishing)
across Mistor, with a view to shorten his road to Princetown on the
moor. The following particulars I have gathered and selected from Mr.
Smith's own account of the circumstance. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

He had not advanced more than a quarter of a mile in his ascent, when he
was so suddenly enveloped in a cloud, dense, dark, and flaky, that it
startled him. On every side appeared whirling masses of mist, of so
thick a consistency that it affected his very breathing. He paused; but
thinking it would be impossible to err in walking in a straight line
over the summit of a hill, continued to advance; but in this he was
deceived. The way seemed to lengthen before him. At last he descried a
few of those immense fragments of granite with which the summit of the
tor was strewed. Their appearance through the fog was wonderfully grand,
wavy, fantastic, and as if possessing life. Although even with the
surface, such was the deception, they appeared upright, each in
succession perpendicular, until he arrived so close, that it required
almost the very touch to prove the deception. There were also some
scattered sheep, one here and there. At the distance of twenty or thirty
yards, for he could distinguish nothing further, they had the appearance
of a moving unshapen mass, infinitely larger than reality. Every now and
then one of these animals would start from the side of a block of
granite close to his feet, affrighted--sometimes with a screaming bleat,
as if, like himself, filled with surprise and awe.

When, as he believed, he had gained the summit, Mr. Smith stood still
and looked about him. There was above, beneath, and all around, a mass,
flaky, and at times even rushing, of white fog. At length he sat down to
rest, feeling unable to walk on. His situation was now painful, and the
evening rapidly approaching. The fog

increased in murkiness, and all hopes that it would clear away vanished.
He looked around for some large fragments of stone, under the shelter of
which to take up his quarters for the night. From exertion he had been
hot even to excess, but was now shivering and chilled. At length he
endeavoured to proceed.

The ground began to incline, and he suddenly found himself descending a
very steep acclivity; presently he heard the distant rushing of water;
the sound enlivened him; it was like the voice of a guide and friend,
and he pressed onward; when suddenly, so instantaneously that he could
compare it to nothing but the lifting up of a veil, the fog rushed from
him, and the scene which opened induced him almost to doubt his very
senses.

At his feet, the river Walkham brawled amongst the rocks scattered
throughout its bed. On his left, was just sufficient of the hamlet of
Merrivale open to show the eastern arch of its picturesque bridge,
whilst in the distance the fantastic rocks of Vixen Tor were still
wreathed in mist. At his right, within two or three hundred yards, was
the very spot he had first quitted to ascend the mountain, and in front
arose one of those grand and lofty tors which render the moor so
striking; it was dark and frowning, its topmost ridges embosomed in
clouds, whose summits were gilded by the broad sun, now rapidly
descending behind them. The whole scene was like magic; even whilst
looking on it, it appeared to him as a dream. He now found that, during
a space of two hours and a half, he had walked up the mountain, taken a
complete circuit of its summit, and almost retraced his steps in his
descent, such had been the deception of this most dangerous mist.

In the winter months, the snow often entirely covers the moor, and so
suddenly and heavily will a snow-storm come on, that travellers have not
unfrequently been confined to the house in which they had the good luck
to take shelter before it arose, for many days and weeks together. At
various times, many a poor creature has been frozen to death on the
moor. An instance that happened many years ago, was truly melancholy. A
shepherd who had so perished was not found till some weeks after his
death, when his dog, nearly starved, was discovered wistfully watching
near the body of his unfortunate master.

At a later period, two boys were sent from a neighbouring farm to look
for some strayed sheep on the moor. They were surprised by a sudden
storm of snow; and not returning their master grew uneasy, and with some
of his men went out to search for them. The lads were found nearly
buried in snow, and both apparently sleeping. In this state they were
removed to the farm-house; one was restored to life, but the other was
quite dead. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)

Besides the huts I mentioned just now, there are a few cottages and
houses, and a very large building on the moot, which is now a dismal
one--a prison.

Some years ago, when there was a war between England and France, King
George III used to send there the Frenchmen who were taken prisoners in
battle by his soldiers and sailors; and now his grand-daughter, Queen
Victoria, still uses it for a prison: and sends there no less than
twelve hundred convicts as a punishment for their having broken the laws
of the land in many ways.

These wicked men are not allowed to live in idleness; but are sent out
to work upon the moor, under the care of a warden, armed with a
double-barrelled gun. There are also a great many of the Queen's troops
who are placed there to guard them, and to prevent their running away,
which, however, I am told they sometimes do; but happily they are always
caught again through their being unable to find any place of shelter, or
anything to live upon, in that barren, lonely, and desolate region.

You have read, my young friends, in your History of England, some
accounts of the ancient Britons, and of the Druids, who were priests and
judges among them. The Druids lived very much together, and formed
schools, in which they taught such arts and learning as they were
acquainted with; and they studied much the stars on heights and open
places, such as those on Dartmoor, where a great many of them dwelt.
They said it was unlawful to perform the rites and ceremonies of their
religion within a covered temple or under a roof of any kind. Whenever
they could, therefore, they chose a hill or lofty mound for the purpose,
as from such they could have a better view of the sun, and the moon, and
the planets, which they were so ignorant as to worship.

Now these temples they made by setting upright in the earth large,
rough, unhewn stones in the form of a circle; and many such are still to
be seen on Dartmoor. Sometimes when they found a very large rock of a
strange and unusual shape, they would at once choose it for a place of
worship, and cut hollows like basins at the top to catch the rainwater,
with which they sprinkled the people, and pretended to cure them of many
diseases of body and mind.

One of these rocks on Dartmoor, called Vixen Tor, is a hundred and ten
feet high; and so curiously formed by nature, that it resembles the
Egyptian Sphinx, which is a very large stone cut into the shape of a
man's face and head, that stands in the sandy desert on the banks of the
river Nile.

Many of the Britons lived in huts on Dartmoor, and these were made, like
the temples, by rough hewn stones set upright in the ground, in the form
of a circle, with walls made of wood and roofs of rushes, high and
tapering like tents. There are, also, still to be seen, here and there,
a circle of very strong stones, so large as to have within its enclosure
a great many small huts; and the sheep and the cattle used to be driven
within it at night, to save them from being devoured by bears and
wolves, which in those days prowled about the moor.

When the Dartmoor Britons buried a chief, who was always a warrior or a
king, the Druids raised a heap of stones over his grave; and sometimes a
very large single piece of granite, supported upon three or four upright
stones, as we see the legs support an old fashioned table; and this they
called a Cromlech.

On the moor, upon the side of a steep hill which rises above the river
Dart, there is the most curious little wood ever seen. It is called
Wistman's Wood, or "the wood of the wise men;" and is supposed to be the
remains of one of the sacred groves of the Druids. It consists of some
very aged and stunted oaks, not above ten or twelve feet high. The boles
of these dwarf-trees are covered with moss of an exceeding thickness,
hung with ivy, and have altogether a most strange and antiquated
appearance.

Now this wild tract of land, as well as other parts of Devonshire and
Cornwall, is considered to be haunted by a set of little creatures,
called Pixies. They are not like children; for, though they are small,
and can sometimes be seen, it is said they can fly as well as run, and
creep through key-holes, and get into the bells of flowers, and many
other places where little boys and girls cannot creep. The Pixies are
sometimes good, and do kind acts; but more frequently they are
mischievous, and do a great deal of harm to men, women, and children, if
they have a spite against them; and often hurt the cattle.

Some people say they are the souls of poor children who die unbaptised,
and others think that they are a kind of fairies, but more frolicsome,
and have more power to do either good or harm. They are, however,
generally considered a distinct race; for if you could but see a Pixy,
my young friends, you would see at once how different was such a
creature from a Fairy. Indeed, it is matter of tradition, that the
Faries wished very much to establish themselves in Devonshire, but the
Pixies would not hear of it; and a terrible war ensued. Oberon was, with
his host, defeated; and his majesty received a wound in the leg which
proved incurable; none of the herbs in his dominions have hitherto had
the least beneficial effects, though his principal secretary and
attendant, Puck, has been in search of one of a healing nature ever
since.

Having said thus much concerning their general character, I will now
proceed to speak a little more about the Pixies and their manners in
detail, as in many respects. they are very curious; and in doing so, for
some few particulars, I shall venture to draw upon my own account, given
in a former work, which, being intended for men and women only, is not
at all likely to fall into the hands of my young friends. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

These tiny elves are said to delight in solitary places, to love
pleasant hills and pathless woods, or to disport themselves on the
margins of rivers and mountain streams. Of all their amusements dancing
forms their chief delight; and this exercise they are said always to
practise, like the Druids of old, in a circle or ring. These dainty
beings, though represented as of exceeding beauty in their higher order,
are nevertheless, in some instances, of strange, uncouth, and fantastic
figure and visage; though such natural deformity need give them very
little uneasiness, since they are traditionally believed to possess the
power of assuming various shapes at will.

Their love of dancing is not unaccompanied with that of music, though it
is often of a nature somewhat different to those sounds which human ears
are apt to consider harmonious. In Devonshire, that unlucky omen, the
cricket's cry, is to them as animating and as well timed as the piercing
notes of the fife, or the dulcet melody of the flute, to mortals. The
frogs sing their double-bass, and the screech-owl is to them like an
aged and favoured minstrel piping in hall. The grasshopper, too, chirps
with his merry note in the concert, and the humming-bee plays "his
hautbois" to their tripping on the green; as the small stream, on whose
banks they hold their sports, seems to share their hilarity, and talks
and dances as well as they, in emulation of the revelry, whilst it shows
through its crystal waters a gravelly bed as bright as burnished gold,
the jewel-house of Pixy-land; or else the pretty stream lies sparkling
in the moonbeam, for no hour is so dear to Pixy revels as that in which
man sleeps, and the queen of night, who loves not his mortal gaze,
becomes a watcher.

It is under the cold light of her beams, or amidst the silent shadows of
the dark rocks, where that light never penetrates, that on the moor the
elfin king of the Pixy race holds his high court of sovereignty and
council. There each Pixy receives his especial charge: some are sent,
like the spirit Gathon of Cornwall, to work the will of his master in
the mines, to show by sure signs, where lies the richest lode; or
sometimes to delude the unfortunate miner, and to mock his toil.

Other Pixies are commissioned on better errands than these; since, nice
in their own persons, for they are the avowed enemies of all sluts, they
sally forth to see if the maidens do their duty with mop and broom, and
if these cares are neglected to give them a good pinching! Many, in this
part of the world, are very particular in sweeping their houses before
they go to bed, and they will frequently place a basin of water by the
chimney nook, to accommodate the Pixies, who are great lovers of water;
and sometimes requite the good deed by dropping a piece of money into
the basin.

Many a Pixy is sent out on works of mischief to deceive the old nurses
and steal away young children, or to do them harm. This is noticed' by
one of our old English poets, Ben Jonson:--

"Under a cradle I did creep  
By day, and, when the childe was asleepe  
At night, I suck'd the breath, and rose  
And pluck'd the nodding nurse by the nose."

The wicked and thievish elves, who are despatched on the dreadful errand
of changing children in the cradle, are all said to be squint-eyed. In
such cases (so say our gossips in Devon) the Pixies use the stolen child
just as the mortal mother may happen to use the changeling dropped in
its stead.

Many, also, bent solely on mischief are sent forth to lead poor
travellers astray, to deceive them with those false lights called
Will-o'-the-wisp, or to guide them a fine dance in trudging home through
woods and water, through bogs and quagmires and every peril; or, as
Robin Goodfellow says, to

"Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harms."

Others, who may be said to content themselves with a practical joke, and
who love frolic better than mischief, will merely make sport by blowing
out the candles on a

sudden, or overturning the cook's pot on the fire. Some Pixies are
dispatched to frolic or make noises in wells; and the more gentle and
kindly race will spin flax and help their favourite damsels to do their
work.

In Devonshire, and more especially on Dartmoor, it is a very common
thing with any person who loses his way, to consider himself as
*Pixy-led,* and this frequently happens to our stout yeomen and farmers,
when they happen to have a cup too much at a merry-making. But for this
there is a remedy. For whoever finds himself; or if a woman herself,
*Pixy-led,* has nothing more to do than to turn jacket, petticoat,
pocket or apron inside out, and a Pixy, who hates the sight of any
impropriety in dress, cannot stand this, and off the imp goes, as if,
according to the vulgar saying, he had been sent packing with a flea in
his ear.

A Pixy-house is often said to be in a rock; sometimes, however, a mole
hill is a palace for the elves, or a hollow nut cracked by the "joiner
squirrel," will contain the majesty of Pixy-land. And Drayton, who wrote
of these little fanciful beings as if he were the chosen laureate of
their race, thus describes their royal dwelling.

"The walls of spiders' legs are made,  
Well morticed and finely laid,  
  
He was the master of his trade  
It curiously that builded;  
The windows of the eyes of cats,  
And for a roof, instead of slats,  
Is covered with the skins of bats,  
With moonshine that are gilded."

And now, my young friends, having told you that both Cornwall and
Devonshire, and more particularly the wild waste of Dartmoor, are said
to be much haunted by Pixies, I shall proceed to give you what I trust
will afford you some amusement in those hours not devoted to your
lessons, or to more serious studies, in a few Pixy tales.
