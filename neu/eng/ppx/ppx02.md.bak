In a work of mine, addressed in a series of letters to the late lamented
poet Laureate, Robert Southey, entitled "The Borders of the Tamar and
the Tary," I gave an account of many of our local superstitions, and
related several legends and traditions, peculiar to this delightful
county: among them were a few Pixy stories. These had the good fortune
to meet with favor both from critic and reader; and confirmed the
opinion I had previously formed concerning the general interest attached
to pixy lore.

The following tales were written for the entertainment of a family
circle of children and young persons. Finding they afforded some
amusement in the quarter for which they were originally designed, I am
induced to commit them to the press, in the hope that they may not be
altogether unacceptable to a more extended circle in their hours of
harmless recreation from more serious pursuits.
