### CHAPTER XIV.

### THE HURLERS (Lat. 50° 31´ N.)

THE sight-lines to which I have drawn attention in relation to the
stones of Stenness had to do with the places of sunrise and sunset in
the May and Solstitial years. I now pass to another group of circles in
which we deal chiefly with the places of star-rise and star-set, some of
the stars being used as warners for sunrise at the critical times of the
two years in question.

Following the clue given me in the case of the Egyptian temples, such as
Luxor, by successive small changes of the axis necessitated by the
change in a star's place due to precession, I began this stellar branch
of the inquiry by looking out for this peculiarity in an examination of
many maps and plans of circles.

I very soon came across two examples in which the sight-line had been
changed in the Egyptian manner. The first is the three circles of the
Hurlers, some 5 miles to the north of Liskeard, a plan of which is given
in "Prehistoric Stone Monuments of the British Isles: Cornwall," by W.
C. Lukis, Rector of Wath, Yorkshire, published by the Society of
Antiquaries, who were so good as to furnish me with a copy, and also

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

some *unfolded* plans on which sight-lines could be accurately drawn and
their azimuths determined. I am anxious to express my obligations to the
council and officers of the society for the help thus afforded inc.

The three circles are thus referred to by Lukis in the valuable
monograph which I have already mentioned.

“On the moor, about a mile to the south of the singular pile of granite
slabs, which rest upon. and overlap each other, and is vulgarly called
the Cheesewring, there are three large circles of granite stones placed
in a nearly straight line in a north-north-east, and south-south-west
direction, of which the middle one is the largest, being 135 feet in
diameter, the north 110 feet, and the south 105 feet.

“The north Circle is 98 feet, and the south 82 feet from the central
one. If a line be drawn uniting the centres of the extreme Circles, the
centre of the middle ring is found to be 12 feet 6 inches to the west of
it.

“These Circles have been greatly injured. The largest consists of 9
erect and 5 prostrate stones; the north Circle has 6 erect and 6
prostrate, and a fragment of a seventh; and the south has 3 erect and 8
prostrate. In Dr. Borlase's time they were in a slightly better
condition. A pen-and-ink sketch made by him, which is extant in one of
Dr. Stukeley's volumes of original drawings, represents the middle
Circle as consisting of 7 erect and 10 prostrate stones; the north of 10
erect and 6 prostrate; and the south of 3 erect and 9 prostrate. The
stone to the east of that marked C in the plan of the middle Circle is
the highest, and is

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 5 feet 8 inches
out of the ground, and appears to have been wantonly mutilated recently.
Two of the prostrate stones of the north Circle are 6 feet 6 inches in
length.

“About 17 feet south from the centre of the middle Circle there is a
prostrate stone 4 feet long and 15 inches wide at one end. It may
possibly have been of larger dimensions formerly, and been erected on
the spot where it now lies, but as Dr. Borlase has omitted it in his
sketch it is probably a displaced stone of the ring.

“If we allow, as before, an average interval of 12 feet between the
stones, there will have been about 28 pillars in the north, 26 in the
south, and 33 in the middle Circle.

"At a distance of 409 feet westwards from K in the middle Circle there
are 2 stones, 7 feet apart, both inclined northwards. One is 4 feet 11
inches in height out of the ground, and overhangs its base 2 feet 7
inches; the other is 5 feet 4 inches high, and over-hangs 18 inches."

I now pass from a general description of the circles to the azimuths of
the sight-lines already referred to, so far as they can be determined
from the published Ordnance maps.

To investigate them as completely as possible without local observations
in the first instance, I begged Colonel. Johnston, R.E., C.B., the
Director-General of the Ordnance Survey, to send me the 25-inch maps of
the site giving the exact azimuth of the side lines. This he obligingly
did, and I have to express my great indebtedness to him.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

In [Fig. 41](#img_fig41.md) I show the sight-lines from the south and north
Circles as determined by the stones and barrows marked on the map. The
sight-lines on Arcturus are from

the centres of the three circles in succession. 1 shall point out later
the significance of the fact that the November alignments are from the
south, the solstitial ones from the north Circle.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Of the various sight-lines found, those to which I wish to direct
attention in the first instance, and which led me to the others, are
approximately, reading the azimuths to the nearest degree,

<div align="center">

|                             |           |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Lat. 50° 31´ N.             | Az.       |
| S. circle to central circle | N. 12° E. |
| Central to N. circle        | N. 15° E. |
| N. circle to tumulus        | N. 19° E. |

</div>

In a preliminary inquiry in anticipation of the necessary local
observations with a theodolite, I assumed hills half a degree high, for
the reason given on [p. 112](sac14.htm#page_112.md). We have the following
declinations approximately:—

<div align="center">

|      |         |
|------|---------|
| Dec. | N. 38½° |
| „    | 38°     |
| „    | 37°     |

</div>

Here, then, we have declinations to work on, but declinations of what
star? To endeavour, to answer this question I studied the declinations
of the three brightest stars in the northern heavens, having
approximately the declinations in question some time or other during the
period 0 to 2500 B.C.

Vega is ruled out as its declination was too high. The remaining stars
Capella and Arcturus may have been observed so far as the declinations
go. For time limits we have:—

<div align="center">

|         |          |           |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Dec. N. | Capella. | Arcturus. |
| 38½°    | 500 B.C. | 1600 B.C. |
| 36°     | 1050 „   | 1150  „   |

</div>

Now there is no question as to which of these two stars we have to deal
with, for the northern circle is

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

evidently less ancient than the others, for some of the stones are
squared and the others are less irregular than those in the S. circle.

This being so, the approximate dates of the use of the three circles at
the Hurlers can be derived. They are, with the above assumption:—

<div align="center">

|          |                 |          |                |                |       |
|----------|-----------------|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
|          |                 |          |                |                | B. C. |
| Southern | circle aligning | Arcturus | over centre of | central circle | 1600  |
| Central  | „               | „        | „              | N. circle      | 1500  |
| Northern | „               | „        | „              | tumulus        | 1300  |

</div>

The next step was to obtain, by means of a large circular protractor,
more accurate readings of the Ordnance Map. This I could do, but the all
important question of the angular height of the horizon remained. As it
was impossible for me to leave London when the significance of the
alignments was made out, I appealed to the authorities of the Royal
Cornwall Polytechnic Society for aid in obtaining the necessary angles,
and as a result, Captain J. S. Henderson, of Falmouth, an accomplished
surveyor, volunteered his aid and shortly sent me the angular heights
along some of the alignments, the means of eight readings obtained with
a 6-inch theodolite, both verniers and reversed telescopes being
employed. Other students of science besides myself will, I am sure, feel
their indebtedness for such opportune help.

The combination of the large protractor and theodolite work gives the
following final values. The difference between them and the provisional
ones given above speaks volumes as to the necessity of a local study of
the height of the horizon, a point I believe invariably neglected by
archæologists.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

FINAL VALUES.

<span id="img_13900"></span> ![](img/13900.jpg)

Now before this evidence of star worship, so important if it can be
depended on, could be accepted, it was necessary to make a special
inquiry as to, the existence of similar star observations in other
places. Many have been found of which more in the sequel.

The next point which arose was that Arcturus used as a clock-star ([p.
108](sac14.htm#page_108).md) would serve as a warner for August. This
necessitated another inquiry into the chief festivals in Cornwall: among
these the August (Harvest) festival is one.

Another point to consider was whether there was any evidence of a local
August festival. It happens that the Hurlers are in the parish of St.
Cleer, and some of the other Arcturus sight-lines are in that of St.
Just. Now, a local festival in old days was often associated with the
local Saint. As most of the Cornish Saints are common to Cornwall and
Brittany, I looked up the Calendar of the *Annuaire* of the *Institut de
France*, and found that the days dedicated

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

to SS. Justin and Claire are the 9th and 12th of August. It seems, then,
that at the Hurlers it was really a question of a clock-star also used
as a warning star for the August festival. I think we have at last,
then, run to earth the origin of some of the northerly alignments
referred to on pages [36](sac08.htm#page_36.md) and
[43](sac08.htm#page_43.md).

It will have been noted that the last sight-line on Arcturus was marked
by a barrow. Captain Henderson inspected it and found it much ruined by
explorers, remains of a chamber inside being visible.

In a subsequent visit, in which Captain Henderson was accompanied by Mr.
Horton Bolitho, my wife and myself, we not only visited this barrow, but
found that the whole hill had been honeycombed to such an extent by
mining operations that it was very difficult to discriminate between
"investigated" barrows and other heaps and holes, unless the barrow
showed the remains of a chamber.

Our examination was not limited to barrows. Captain Henderson had spent
a long bleak day in examining and measuring the stones marked on the
Ordnance Map, to which I had called his special attention. We went over
part of the ground with him, and came to the conclusion that the whole
question of the Cornish treatment of "ancient stones" would have to be
gone into—an inquiry which Mr. Bolitho is now carrying on.

It must be remembered that any stone or barrow used in the sight-lines
we are now considering must have been put up nearly 4,000 years ago, so
long ago, in fact, that many of the chief barrows have been reduced to
the skeletons of their former selves, the

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

enclosed stone chamber, built of mighty stones, alone remaining:

Cromlechs and standing stones then formed important points in the
landscape long before ecclesiastical divisions were thought of, or any
attempt was made to indicate the boundaries of private property.

We should expect then to find these ancient monuments freely made use of
to mark what we now term "parish boundaries." This is so. Four parishes
have thus used one of the larger cromlechs, and it is more than probable
that something beside the denunciation of the *cultus lapidum*, which we
have seen at work in Brittany ([p. 39](sac08.htm#page_39).md), has been
responsible for the many stone crosses in Cornwall. Of some of them near
circles I have gathered the astronomical use, while now they "mark the
bounds," as do some of the stone rows in Dartmoor.

I believe that in later times this practice of the Church was followed
by those among whom the land was distributed, and this has gone on till
at last there are many ancient stones trimmed on one side and bearing
initials and so having a modern appearance. The astronomer, and even the
archaeologist, may regret this practice, but as the habit in Cornwall
appears to be for anybody to use the nearest uncrossed and uninitialled
stone for a wall or a pigsty, Mr. Bolitho's inquiry may show that in
some cases, at all events, it has been a blessing in disguise, for the
stones are still there.

In the case of a long chambered barrow, the top of which nearly touches
the horizon, as seen from a circle near it, there is less danger of
being misled.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

In my notes on the stones of Stenness (Chapter XIII) I pointed out that
the chambered Cairns at Onston and Maeshowe suggested that such
structures were later variants of the more ancient standing stones. Some
barrows at the Hurlers lend further confirmation of this view. I will
deal with them first. Of one the data are Az. from N. Circle S. 72° 49´
W., height of horizon 12´ (Capt. Henderson). The resulting declination
is S. 11° 5´, the declination of Antares 1720 B.C. But why should
Antares be thus singled out? The table on page [117](sac14.htm#page_117.md)
shows the reason. At the date involved the setting of Antares in the
dawn was the warner of the sunrise on May morning, the greatest day in
all the year.

Is there any precedent for this use of Antares?

I have already pointed out ([p. 108](sac14.htm#page_108).md) that Mr.
Penrose found the warning stars for May morning at the dates of
foundation of the Hecatompedon, and the older Erechtheum, to be the
group of the Pleiades rising and *Antares* setting. As the foundations
of the Hecatompedon were built only some few years after the stones of
the central circle of the Hurlers were used, we ought to find traces of
the observations of the same May-morning stars.

We have, then, now a third term in the astronomical use of stars to
herald the sunrise on May morning.

The next barrow to be referred to—it is shown to be a long one on the
Ordnance Map—is situated

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

near the top of Caradon Hill, and is visible, on the skyline from the
circles. Data: Az. from N. Circle S. 65° E., height of horizon 1° 38´
(Henderson). This corresponds almost exactly with the azimuth of the
rise of the sun's upper limb with declination S. 16° 20´ on the two
critical dates in November and February of the May-year (Halloween and
Candlemas, see [p. 23](sac06.htm#page_23).md), so I am. inclined to
consider it more than a mere coincidence that the azimuths coincide so
closely. It, however, may be urged that there are other barrows on
Caradon Hill, but judging from the Ordnance Map they seem to be of the
round variety used for burials, perhaps a thousand years after the
circles were in use, and in my opinion by a different race of men; but
this matter must not detain us now, I hope to return to it later.

Still one more barrow and a stone, uncrossed and uninitialled, in the
same sight-line, data: Az. from N. circle S. 59° 35´ E. Height of
horizon 1° 38´ 23″ (Henderson), resulting declination S. 19° 50´. This
was the declination of Sirius 1690 B.C. Why Sirius? The table on [p.
117](sac14.htm#page_117.md) gives us the answer. Sirius replaced Arcturus
as a warning star for the August festival, and we have seen that the
last use of Arcturus was connected with the sight-line to the barrow
about 1900 B.C.

I pass now from barrows to stones. There is one about which there can be
no question. It is a famous Cross, a "Longstone" at which all travellers
stop on their way from St. Cleer to the Hurlers. It occupies nearly the
same position on the S.W. horizon as does the long tumulus on Caradon
Hill in the S.E. quadrant. From the South Circle, and this is important,
its

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Azimuth, S. 64°
W., is nearly the same; it marked, and still marks, the sunset point on
the critical days of the May year in November and February.

There is another stone marked on the Ordnance Map Az: N. 88° E. from the
N. circle. It Chas been removed, so I may fairly assume that it was
really an ancient stone. Captain Henderson's value for the height of the
horizon is 11´ 31″. The table on [p. 117](sac14.htm#page_117.md) will show
that in this direction we have to deal with Betelgeuse as a warner for
the summer solstice. The resulting date is 1730 B.C.

It would appear that possibly this is not the only stone dealing with
(later) solstitial alignments. Lukis gives two stones on the west side
of the circles which on the Ordnance Map are classed as boundary stones:
they lie on a boundary beyond all question, but also beyond all question
they are as ancient as the stones(of the circles themselves. From the N.
circle they are almost but not quite in a line, and the azimuth of the
south stone is S. 49° W. This is a solstitial azimuth. I think,
therefore, that we may accept this as another evidence of the worship of
the setting sun at the winter solstice, *from the N. circle*, and in
this we, have still further evidence that to the worship of the May year
in the south circle was added later one dealing with the solstitial year
which was chiefly carried on in the N. circle.
