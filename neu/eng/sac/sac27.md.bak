### CHAPTER XXIV

### THE MAY-YEAR IN SOUTH-WEST CORNWALL

THE previous pages of this volume have apparently dealt with two
distinct subjects; the use of the British monuments on the orientation
theory, and the folklore and tradition which enable us to get some
glimpses into the lives, actions, habits and beliefs of the early
inhabitants of these islands, and the-region whence these early
inhabitants had migrated.

But although these subjects are apparently distinct, I think my readers
will agree that the study of each has led to an identical result,
namely, that in early times it was a question of the May year, and that
the solstitial year was introduced afterwards. This was the chief
revelation of the monuments when they were studied from the astronomical
point of view.

Without confirmation from some other sources this result might have been
considered as doubtful, and the orientation theory might have been
thought valueless. It has, however, been seen that folklore and
tradition confirm it up to the hilt. I think it may be said, therefore,
that the theory I put forward in this book touching the astronomical use
of our ancient temples is so far justified.

The British monuments I had considered before this appeal to tradition
was made were the circles at Stonehenge,

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Stenness, The
Hurlers and Stanton Drew, and the avenues on Dartmoor. These were
studied generally, the main special result being that to which I have
referred; we not only found alignments to sunrise and sunset on the
critical quarter-days of the May years, but we found alignments to the
stars which should have been observed either at rising or setting to
control the morning sacrifices.

But this inquiry had left out of account several circles in south-west
Cornwall, of which I had vaguely heard but never seen. When I had
written the previous chapters showing how fully May-year practices are
referred to in the folklore of that part of the country, I determined to
visit the circles, dealing with them as test objects in regard to this
special branch of orientation. I had not time to make a complete survey;
this I must leave to others; but with the help so readily afforded me,
which I shall acknowledge in its proper place, I thought it possible. in
a brief visit to see whether or not there were any May-year alignments.
In the following chapters I will give an account of the observations
made, but before doing so, in order to prove how solid the evidence
afforded by the Cornish monuments is, I will state the details of the
local astronomical conditions depending upon the latitude of the Land's
End region, N. 50°. In the chapter containing some astronomical hints to
archaeologists I referred (p. 122) to the solstice conditions for
Stenness beyond John o’ Groat's, because those conditions afforded a
special case, the solstice being determined by the arrival of the sun at
its highest or lowest declination, which happens on particular dates
which recur each year. But with regard to the

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> May year, during
the first week of May the sun's declination is changing by over a
quarter of a degree daily, so that we must not expect to find the
declination of 16° 20´ (see [p. 22](sac06.htm#page_22).md) rigidly adhered
to.

As I have shown ([p. 23](sac06.htm#page_23).md), the sun's passage through
this declination four times on its annual path on the dates stated
accurately divides the year into four equal part's. But this accuracy
might have been neglected by the early observers, so that, for instance,
the sun's position on the 4th or 8th of May instead of that on the 6th
might have been chosen as being in greater harmony with the agricultural
conditions at the place.

The conditions of the sunrise from John o’ Groat's to Land's End, 2´ of
the sun being visible above the skyline, can be gathered from the
following diagram:—
