After centuries of speculation the origin, purpose, and construction of
Stonehenge is still a mystery. Out of the hundreds of books on the
subject, a few stand out. Lockyer's careful survey of the monument and
other Northern European megaliths is one of these. Lockyer, who had
spotless academic credentials, raised some of the themes which would
dominate mainstream theories of Stonehenge during the 20th century,
particularly his focus on archaeo-astronomy. Lockyer's primary
hypothesis, that Stonehenge and other megalithic constructions were
ancient observatories, is still considered plausible. He also noted the
vast alignments of sites which covered the landscape, both in Britain
and in northern France, anticipating [Afred Watkins'](../ebt/index)
discovery of ley lines by over a decade.

On the other hand, his conclusion that Stonehenge was constructed by
immigrants from the Near East was, even then, controversial. The use of
large stones to construct monuments was global in nature over a long
period of history. Lockyer rolls out the well-known folklore evidence
for Celtic tree, well, and stone worship, which had parallels in ancient
Near Eastern paganism. However, the people who constructed Stonehenge
were pre-Celtic, and their religious beliefs are still a matter for
speculation. This isn't to say that his hypothesis is implausible, just
that there is no concrete evidence to support it.

Production notes: this text was scanned from a print-on-demand edition
of this book, due to the unavailability of an original. For this reason,
due to speckling, the OCR stage introduced a great deal of spurious
punctuation which had to be edited out, and some problems of this nature
may still remain, even though due care was taken in proofing. In
addition, the scanned illustrations are not of the highest quality.
Hopefully this will be remedied at some point--J.B. Hare.
