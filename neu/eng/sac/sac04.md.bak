# STONEHENGE

### CHAPTER I.

### INTRODUCTORY

IN the book I published ten years ago, entitled "The Dawn of Astronomy,"
I gave a pretty full account of the principles and the methods of
observation which enable us to trace the ideas which were in the minds
of the ancient Egyptians when they set out the line of a temple they
proposed to build.

Numerous references to the ceremonial of laying the foundation-stones of
temples exist, and we learn from the works of Chabas, Brugsch,
Dümichen <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and others, that the
foundation of an Egyptian temple was associated with a series of
ceremonies which are repeatedly described with great minuteness. Amongst
these ceremonies, one especially refers to the fixing of the
temple-axis; it is called, technically, "the stretching of the cord,"
and is not only illustrated by inscriptions on the walls of the temples
of Karnak, Denderah and Edfu—to mention the best-known cases—but is
referred to elsewhere.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

During the ceremony the king proceeded to the site where the temple was
to be built, accompanied mythically by the goddess Sesheta, who is
styled "the mistress of the laying of the foundation-stone."

Each was armed with a stake. The two stakes were connected by a cord.
Next the cord was aligned towards the sun on some day of the year, or a
star, as the case might be; when the alignment was perfect the two
stakes were driven into the ground by means of a wooden mallet. One
boundary wall parallel to the main axis of the temple was built along
the line marked out. by this stretched cord.

If the moment of the rising or setting of the sun or star were chosen,
as we have every reason to believe was the case, seeing that all the
early observations were made on the horizon, it is obvious that the
light from the body towards which the temple was thus aligned would
penetrate the axis of the temple from one end to the other in the
original direction of the cord.

We learn from Chabas that the Egyptian word which expresses. the idea of
founding or laying the foundation-stone of a temple is *Senti*—a word
which still exists in Coptic. But in the old language another word
*Pet-ser*, which no longer remains in Coptic, has been traced. It has
been established that *pet* means to stretch, and *ser* means cord, so
that that part of the ceremonial which consisted in stretching a cord in
the direction of a star was considered of so great an importance that it
gave its name to the whole ceremonial.

Dealing with the existing remains of Egyptian temples, it may be said
that the most majestic among them was that of Amen-Rā at Karnak,
dedicated to the Sun-God,

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

and oriented, to catch the light, of the sun setting at the summer
solstice, the time of the year at which the all-important rise of the
Nile began.

Although the sun is no longer worshipped in Egypt or Britain,
sun-worship has not yet disappeared from the world. Professor Gowland
has recently <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) brought to notice a
surviving form of sun-worship in Japan. I quote his statement:—

"There on the seashore at Fûta-mi-ga-ura (as will be seen in a copy of a
print which I obtained at that ancient place) the orientation of the
shrine of adoration is given by two gigantic rocks which rise from the
sea as natural pillars. The sun as it rises over the mountains of the
distant shore is observed between them, and the customary prayers and
offerings made in that direction ([Fig. 1](#img_fig01).md).

"It is, too, specially worthy of note that the point from which the sun
is revered is marked by a structure of the form of a trilithon, but made
of wood, placed immediately behind the altar. This representative of the
trilithon is of very remote date in Japan, and has been in use there
from the earliest times in connection with the observances of the
ancient Shintō cult in which the Sun-Goddess is the chief deity. One of
its important uses, which still survives, was to indicate the direction
of the position of some sacred place or object of veneration, in order
that worshippers might make their prayers and oblations towards the
proper quarter."

The table of offerings must also be noted.

In the book to which I have referred, I also endeavoured to show that a
knowledge of even elementary

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

astronomy may be of very great assistance to students of archæology,
history, folk-lore and all that learning which deals with man's first
attempts to grasp the

meaning and phenomena of the universe in which he found himself before
any scientific methods were available to him; before he had any idea of
the origins or the conditionings of the things around him.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

It may be well, however, in the present book to restate the underlying
astronomical principles in the briefest possible manner; and this is the
more easily done because, in the absence of measuring instruments, the
horizon was the only circle which the ancient peoples could employ
effectively, and we need only therefore consider it.

Indeed, whether we regard the Rig-Veda or the Egyptian monuments from an
astronomical point of view, we are struck by the fact that the early
worship

and all the early observations related to the horizon. This was true not
only for the sun, but for all the stars which studded the general
expanse of sky.

We have therefore chiefly to consider the relation of the horizon of any
place to the apparent movements of celestial bodies at that place.

We now know that the earth rotates on its axis, but this idea was of
course quite unknown to these early peoples. Since the earth rotates,
with stars infinitely removed surrounding it on all sides, the apparent
movements of the stars will depend very much upon

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

the position we happen to occupy on the earth. An observer at the North
Pole of the earth, for instance,

would see the stars moving round in circles parallel to the horizon
(Fig. 2). No star could therefore either rise

or set—one half of the heavens would be always visible above his
horizon, and the other half invisible. An observer at the South Pole
would of course see that

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

half of the stars invisible to the observer at the northern one.

If the observer be on the equator, the movements of the stars will
appear to be as indicated in this diagram ([Fig. 3](#img_fig03).md)—that
is, all the stars will rise and set, and each star will be, in turn,
twelve hours above the horizon, and the same time below it. But if we
consider the position of an observer in a middle latitude, say at
Stonehenge, we find that some stars will always be above the horizon,
some always below—that is, they will neither rise nor set. All other
stars will both rise and set, but some of them will be above the horizon
for a long time and below for a short time, whereas others will be a
very short time above the horizon and a long time below it, each star
completing a circle in a day ([Fig. 4](#img_fig04).md).

Wherever we are upon the earth we always imagine that we are on the top
of it. The idea held by all the early peoples was that the surface of
the earth near them was an extended plain: they imagined that the land
that they knew and just the surrounding lairds were really in the centre
of the extended plain. Plato, for instance, was content to think the
Mediterranean and Greece upon the top of a cube, and Anaximander placed
the same region at the top of a cylinder.

By the use of a terrestrial globe we can best study the conditions of
observation at the poles of the earth, the equator and some place in
middle latitude. The wooden horizon of the globe is parallel to the
horizon of a place at the top of the globe, which horizon we can
represent by a wafer. By inclining the axis of the globe and watching
the movement of the wafer as the

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

globe is turned round, we can get a very concrete idea of the different
relations of the observer's horizon to the apparent paths of the stars
in different latitudes.

We have next to deal with the astronomical relations of the horizon of
any place, in connection with the observation of the sun and stars at
the times of rising or setting, when of course they are on or near the
horizon; and in order to bring this matter nearer to the ancient
monuments, we will study this question for both Thebes and Stonehenge.
We .may take the latitude of Thebes as 25°, Stonehenge as 51°, and we
will begin with Thebes.

To consider an observer on the Nile at Thebes and to adjust things
properly we must rectify a celestial globe to the latitude of 25° N.,
or, in other words, incline the axis of the globe at that angle to the
wooden horizon.

Since all the stars which pass between the North Pole and the horizon
cannot set, all their Apparent movements will take place above the
horizon. All the stars between the horizon and the South Pole will never
rise. Hence, stars within the distance of 25° from the North Pole will
never set at Thebes, and those stars within 25° of the South Pole will
never be visible there. At any place the latitude and the elevation of
the pole are the same. It so happens that many of those places with
which archeologists have to do in studying the history of early
peoples—Chaldæa, Egypt, Babylonia, &c.—are in low middle latitudes,
therefore we have to deal with bodies in the skies which do set and
bodies which do not, and the elevation of the pole is neither very great
nor very small. But

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

although in each different latitude the inclination of the equator to
the horizon as well as the elevation of the pole will vary, there will
be a strict relationship between the inclination of the equator at each
place and the elevation of the pole. Except at the poles themselves the
equator will cut the horizon due east. and due west; therefore every
celestial body to the north of the celestial equator which rises and
sets will cut the horizon between the east and west point and the north
point; those bodies which do not rise will of course not cut the horizon
at all.

The stars near the equator, and the sun, in such a latitude as that of
Thebes, will appear to rise or set at no very considerable angle from
the vertical; but when we deal with stars very near to the north or
south points of the horizon they will seem to skim along the horizon
instead of rising directly.

 

We now pass on to Stonehenge. To represent the new condition the axis of
the globe will now require to be inclined 51° to the horizon. The number
of northern stars which do not set and of southern stars which do not
rise will be much greater than at Thebes. The most northern and southern
stars visible will in their movement hug the horizon more closely than
was observed under the Thebes condition.

The sun, both at Thebes and Stonehenge, since it moves among the stars
from 23½° N. to 23½° S. each year, will change its place of rising and
setting at different times of the year.

Now it will at once be obvious that there must be a strict law
connecting the position of a star with its

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

place of rising or setting. Stars at the same distance from the
celestial pole or equator will rise or set at the same point of the
horizon, and if a star does not change its place in the heavens it will
always rise or set in the same place.

The sun as it changes its position each day, in its swing N. and S. of
the equator, will rise and set on any day in the same place as a star
which permanently has the same distance from the equator as that
temporarily occupied by the sun.

Here it will be convenient to introduce one or two technical terms we
generally define a star's place by giving, as one ordinate, its distance
in degrees from the equator: this distance is called its *declination*.

Further, we generally define points on the horizon by dividing its whole
circumference into 360°, so that we can have *azimuths* up to 90° from
the north and south points to the east and west points. We also have
*amplitudes* from the east and west points towards the north and south
points. We can say, then, that a star of a certain declination, or the
sun when it occupies that declination, will rise or set at such an
azimuth, or at such an amplitude. This will apply to both north and
south declinations.

Then supposing the azimuth to be. 39° in the N.E. quadrant, it is
written N. 39° E. For the other quadrants we have N. 39° W., S. 39° E.,
and S. 39° W., respectively.

The following table gives the amplitudes of rising or setting (north or
south) of celestial bodies having declinations from 0° to 64°, at Thebes
and Stonehenge respectively.

AMPLITUDES AT THEBES AND STONEHENGE.  

The amplitude is always the complement of the azimuth, so that amplitude
+ azimuth = 90°. Later on I shall give amplitudes for latitudes higher
than that of Stonehenge, so that still more northerly monuments can be
considered.
