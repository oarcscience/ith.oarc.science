<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now ponder well, you parents dear,<BR>
These words which I shall write;<BR>
A doleful story you shall hear,<BR>
In time brought forth to light.<BR>
A gentleman of good account,<BR>
In Norfolk dwelt of late,<BR>
Who did in honour far surmount<BR>
Most men of his estate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sore sick he was and like to die,<BR>
No help his life could save;<BR>
His wife by him as sick did lie,<BR>
And both possest one grave.<BR>
No love between these two was lost,<BR>
Each was to other kind;<BR>
In love they lived, in love they died,<BR>
And left two babes behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The one a fine and pretty boy<BR>
Not passing three years old,<BR>
The other a girl more young than he,<BR>
And framed in beauty's mould.<BR>
The father left his little son,<BR>
As plainly did appear,<BR>
When he to perfect age should come,<BR>
Three hundred pounds a year;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And to his little daughter Jane<BR>
Five hundred pounds in gold,<BR>
To be paid down on marriage-day,<BR>
Which might not be controlled.<BR>
But if the children chanced to die<BR>
Ere they to age should come,<BR>
Their uncle should possess their wealth;<BR>
For so the will did run.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Now, brother,' said the dying man,<BR>
'Look to my children dear;<BR>
Be good unto my boy and girl,<BR>
No friends else have they here;<BR>
To God and you I recommend<BR>
My children dear this day;<BR>
But little while be sure we have<BR>
Within this world to stay.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'You must be father and mother both,<BR>
And uncle, all in one;<BR>
God knows what will become of them<BR>
When I am dead and gone.'<BR>
With that bespake their mother dear;<BR>
'O brother kind,' quoth she,<BR>
'You are the man must bring our babes<BR>
To wealth or misery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'And if you keep them carefully,<BR>
Then God will you reward;<BR>
But if you otherwise should deal,<BR>
God will your deeds regard.'<BR>
With lips as cold as any stone,<BR>
They kissed their children small:<BR>
'God bless you both, my children dear!'<BR>
With that the tears did fall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These speeches then their brother spake<BR>
To this sick couple there:<BR>
'The keeping of your little ones,<BR>
Sweet sister, do not fear;<BR>
God never prosper me nor mine,<BR>
Nor aught else that I have,<BR>
If I do wrong your children dear<BR>
When you are laid in grave!'</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
The parents being dead and gone,<BR>
The children home he takes,<BR>
And brings them straight unto his house<BR>
Where much of them he makes.<BR>
He had not kept these pretty babes<BR>
A twelvemonth and a day,<BR>
But, for their wealth, he did devise<BR>
To make them both away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He bargained with two ruffians strong,<BR>
Which were of furious mood,<BR>
That they should take these children young,<BR>
And slay them in a wood.<BR>
He told his wife an artful tale<BR>
He would the children send<BR>
To be brought up in London town<BR>
With one that was his friend.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Away then went those pretty babes,<BR>
Rejoicing at that tide,<BR>
Rejoicing with a merry mind<BR>
They should on cock-horse ride.<BR>
They prate and prattle pleasantly,<BR>
As they ride on the way,<BR>
To those that should their butchers be<BR>
And work their lives' decay:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So that the pretty speech they had<BR>
Made Murder's heart relent;<BR>
And they that undertook the deed<BR>
Full sore now did repent.<BR>
Yet one of them, more hard of heart,<BR>
Did vow to do his charge,<BR>
Because the wretch that hired him<BR>
Had paid him very large.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The other won't agree thereto,<BR>
So there they fall to strife;<BR>
With one another they did fight<BR>
About the children's life;<BR>
And he that was of mildest mood<BR>
Did slay the other there,<BR>
Within an unfrequented wood;<BR>
The babes did quake for fear!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He took the children by the hand,<BR>
Tears standing in their eye,<BR>
And bade them straightway follow him,<BR>
And look they did not cry;<BR>
And two long miles he led them on,<BR>
While they for food complain:<BR>
'Stay here,' quoth he, 'I'll bring you bread,<BR>
When I come back again.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These pretty babes, with hand in hand,<BR>
Went wandering up and down;<BR>
But never more could see the man<BR>
Approaching from the town.<BR>
Their pretty lips from blackberries<BR>
Were all besmeared and dyed;<BR>
And when they saw the darksome night,<BR>
They sat them down and cried.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thus wandered these poor innocents,<BR>
Till death did end their grief;<BR>
In one another's arms they died,<BR>
As wanting due relief:<BR>
No burial this pretty pair<BR>
From any man receives,<BR>
Till Robin Redbreast piously<BR>
Did cover them with leaves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And now the heavy wrath of God<BR>
Upon their uncle fell;<BR>
Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,<BR>
His conscience felt an hell:<BR>
His barns were fired, his goods consumed,<BR>
His hands were barren made,<BR>
His cattle died within the field,<BR>
And nothing with him stayed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And in a voyage to Portugal<BR>
Two of his sons did die;<BR>
And to conclude, himself was brought<BR>
To want and misery:<BR>
He pawned and mortgaged all his land<BR>
Ere seven years came about.<BR>
And now at last this wicked act<BR>
Did by this means come out.</P>
<P><BR>
<BR>
The fellow that did take in hand<BR>
These children for to kill,<BR>
Was for a robbery judged to die.<BR>
Such was God's blessed will:<BR>
Who did confess the very truth,<BR>
As here hath been displayed:<BR>
The uncle having died in jail,<BR>
Where he for debt was laid.</P>
<P>You that executors be made,<BR>
And overseers eke,<BR>
Of children that be fatherless,<BR>
And infants mild and meek,<BR>
Take you example by this thing,<BR>
And yield to each his right,<BR>
Lest God with suchlike misery<BR>
Your wicked minds requite.</P>
