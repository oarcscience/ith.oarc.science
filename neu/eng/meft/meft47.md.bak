# Notes

44\. THE PIED PIPER

SOURCE Abraham Elder, *Tales and Legends of the Isle of Wight* (London,
1839), pp. 157 -- 64. Mr Nutt, who has abridged and partly rewritten the
story from a copy of Elder's book in his possession, has introduced a
couple of touches from Browning.PARALLELS The well-known story of the
Pied Piper of Hameln (Hamelin), immortalised by Browning, will at once
recur to every reader's mind. Before Browning, it had been told in
English in books as well known as Verstegan's *Restitution of Decayed
Intelligence,* 1605; Howell's *Familiar Letters* (see my edition, p.
357, *n.);* and Wanley's *Wonders of the Little World.* Browning is said
to have taken it from the last source (Furnivall, *Browning
Bibliography,* 158), though there are touches which seem to me to come
from Howell (see my note ad loc.), while it is not impossible he may
have come across Elder's book, which was illustrated by Cruikshank. The
Grimms give the legend in their *Deutsche Sagen* (ed. 1816, 330 -- 3),
and in its native land it has given rise to an elaborate poem *à* *la*
Scheffel by Julius Wolff, which has in its turn been the occasion of an
opera by Victor Nessler. Mrs Gutch, in an interesting study of the myth
in *Folk-Lore,* iii, pp. 227 -- 52, quotes a poem, *The Sea Piece,*
published by Dr Kirkpatrick in 1750, as showing that a similar legend
was told of the Cave Hill, Belfast.

Here, as Tradition's hoary legend tells,  
A blinking Piper once with magic Spells  
And strains beyond a vulgar Bagpipe's sounds  
Gathered the dancing Country wide around.

When hither as he drew the tripping Rear  
(Dreadful to think and difficult to swear!)  
The gaping Mountain yawned from side to side,  
A hideous Cavern, darksome, deep, and wide;  
In skipt th' exulting Demon, piping loud,  
With passive joy succeeded by the Crowd.

...

There firm and instant closed the greedy Womb,  
Where wide-born Thousands met a common Tomb.

REMARKS Mr Baring-Gould, in his *Curious Myths of the Middle Ages,* has
explained the Pied Piper as a wind myth; Mrs Gutch is inclined to think
there may be a substratum of fact at the root of the legend, basing her
conclusions on a pamphlet of Dr Meinardus, *Der historische Kern,* which
I have not seen. She does not, however, give any well-authenticated
historical event at Hameln in the thirteenth century which could have
plausibly given rise to the legend, nor can I find any in the
*Urkundenbuch* of Hameln (Luneberg, 1883). The chief question of
interest attaching to the English form of the legend as given in 1839 by
Elder is whether it is independent of the German myth. It does not occur
in any of the local histories of the Isle of Wight which I have been
able to consult of a date previous to Elder's book -- e.g. J. Hassel,
*Tour of the Isle of Wight,* 1790. *Mr* Shore, in his *History of
Hampshire,* 1891, p. 185, refers to the legend, but evidently bases his
reference on Elder, and so with all the modern references I have seen.
Now, Elder himself quotes Verstegan in his comments on the legend, pp.
168 -- 9 and note, and it is impossible to avoid conjecturing that he
adapted Verstegan to the locality. Newtown, when Hassel visited it in
1790, had only six or seven houses (l.c., i, 137 -- 8), though it had
the privilege of returning two members to Parliament; it had been a
populous town by the name of Franchville before the French invasion of
the island of *temp.* Ric. II. It is just possible that there may have
been a local legend to account for the depopulation by an exodus of the
children. But the expression 'pied piper' which Elder used clearly came
from Verstegan, and until evidence is shown to the contrary the whole of
the legend was adapted from him. It is not without significance that
Elder was writing in the days of the *Ingoldsby Legends,* and had
possibly no more foundation for the localisation of his stories than
Barham.

There still remains the curious parallel from Belfast to which Mrs Gutch
has drawn attention. Magic pipers are not unknown to English folk-lore,
as in the Percy ballad of *The Frere and the Boy,* or in the nursery
rhyme of Tom the Piper's son in its more extended form. But beguiling
into a mountain is not known elsewhere except at Hameln, which was made
widely known in England by Verstegan's and Howell's accounts, so that
the Belfast variant is also probably to be traced to the *Rattenfanger.*
Here again, as in the case of Beddgellert *(Celtic Fairy Tales,* No.
xxi), the Blinded Giant and the Pedlar of Swaffham *(infra,* Nos. 61,
63), we have an imported legend adapted to local conditions.

 

45\. HEREAFTERTHIS

SOURCE Sent me anonymously soon after the appearance of *English Fairy
Tales.* From a gloss in the MS. 'vitty' = Devonian for 'decent', I
conclude the tale is current in Devon. I should be obliged if the sender
would communicate with me.  
PARALLELS The latter part has a certain similarity with 'Jack Hannaford'
(No. 8). Halliwell's story of the miser who kept his money 'for luck'
(p. 153) is of the same type. Halliwell remarks that the tale throws
light on a passage in Ben Jonson:

Say we are robbed,  
If any come to borrow a spoon or so  
I will not have Good Fortune or God's Blessing  
Let in, while I am busy.

The earlier part of the tale has resemblance with 'Lazy Jack' (No. 27),
the European variants of which are given by M. Cosquin, *Contes de
Lorraine,* i, 241. Jan's satisfaction with his wife's blunders is also
European (Cosquin, l.c., i, 157). On minding the door and dispersing
robbers by its aid see 'Mr Vinegar'.  
REMARKS 'Hereafterthis' is thus a *mélange* of droll incidents, yet has
characteristic folkish touches ('can you milk-y, bake-y', 'when I lived
home') which give it much vivacity.

 

46\. THE GOLDEN BALL

SOURCE Contributed to the first edition of Henderson's *Folk-Lore of the
Northern Counties,* pp. 333 -- 5, by Rev. S. Baring-Gould.  
PARALLELS Mr Nutt gave a version in *Folk-Lore Journal,* vi, 144. The
man in instalments occurs in 'The Strange Visitor' (No. 32). The latter
part of the tale has been turned into a game for English children, 'Mary
Brown', given in Miss Plunket's *Merry Games,* but not included in
Newell, *Games and Songs of American Children.  
*REMARKS This story is especially interesting as having given rise to a
game. Capture and imprisonment are frequently the gruesome *motif* of
children's games, as in 'Prisoner's base'. Here it has been used with
romantic effect.

 

47\. MY OWN SELF

SOURCE Told to Mrs Balfour by Mrs W., a native of North Sunderland, who
had seen the cottage and heard the tale from persons who had known the
widow and her boy, and had got the story direct from them. The title was
'Me A'an Sel'', which I have altered to 'My Own Self'.  
PARALLELS Notwithstanding Mrs Balfour's informant, the same tale is
widely spread in the North Country. Hugh Miller relates it, in his
*Scenes from my Childhood,* as 'Ainsel'; it is given in Mr Hartland's
*English Folk and Fairy Tales;* Mr F. B. Jevons has heard it in the
neighbourhood of Durham; while a further version appeared in *Monthly
Chronicle of North Country Folk-Lore.* Further parallels abroad are
enumerated by Mr Clouston in his *Book of Noodles,* pp. 184 -- 5, and by
the late Prof. Köhler in *Orient und Occident,* ii, 331. The expedient
by which Ulysses outwits Polyphemus in the Odyssey by calling himself
οϋτις is clearly of the same order.  
REMARKS The parallel with the Odyssey suggests the possibility that this
is the ultimate source of the legend, as other parts of the epic have
been adapted to local requirements in Great Britain, as in the 'Blinded
Giant' (No. 61), or 'Conall Yellowclaw' *(Celtic Fairy Tales,* No. v).
The fact of Continental parallels disposes of the possibility of its
being a merely local legend. The fairies might appear to be in a
somewhat novel guise here as something to be afraid of. But this is the
usual attitude of the folk towards the 'Good People', as indeed their
euphemistic name really implies.

 

48\. THE BLACK BULL OF NORRO WAY

SOURCE Chambers's *Popular Rhymes of Scotland,* much Anglicised in
language, but otherwise unaltered.  
PARALLELS Chambers, l.c., gave a variant with the title 'The Red Bull o'
Norroway'. Kennedy, *Legendary Fictions,* p. 87, gives a variant with
the title 'The Brown Bear of Norway'. Mr Stewart gave a Leitrim version,
in which 'Norroway' becomes 'Orange', in *Folk-Lore* for June 1893,
which Miss Peacock follows up with a Lincolnshire parallel (showing the
same corruption of name) in the September number. A reference to the
'Black Bull o' Norroway' occurs in Sidney's *Arcadia,* as also in the
*Complaynt of Scotland,* 1548. The 'sale of bed' incident at the end has
been bibliographised by Miss Cox in her volume of variants of
*Cinderella,* p. 481. It probably existed in one of the versions of *Nix
Nought Nothing* (No. 7).  
REMARKS The Black Bull is clearly a Beast who ultimately wins a Beauty.
But the tale as told is clearly not sufficiently motivated. Miss
Peacock's version renders it likely that a fuller account may yet be
recovered in England.

 

49\. YALLERY BROWN

SOURCE Mrs Balfour's 'Legends of the Lincolnshire Fens', in *Folk-Lore,*
ii. It was told to Mrs Balfour by a labourer, who professed to be the
hero of the story, and related it in the first person. I have given him
a name, and changed the narration into the oblique narration, and toned
down the dialect.  
PARALLELS 'Tiddy Mun', the hero of another of Mrs Balfour's legends
(l.c., p. 151), was 'none bigger'n a three-years-old bairn', and had no
proper name.  
REMARKS One might almost suspect Mrs Balfour of being the victim of a
piece of invention on the part of her autobiographical informant. But
the scrap of verse, especially in its original dialect, has such a
folkish ring that it is probable he was only adapting a local legend to
his own circumstances.

 

50\. THE THREE FEATHERS

SOURCE Collected by Mrs Gomme from some hop-pickers near Deptford.  
PARALLELS The beginning is *à* *la* Cupid and Psyche, on which Mr Lang's
monograph in the Carabas series is the classic authority. The remainder
is an Eastern tale, the peregrinations of which have been studied by Mr
Clouston in his *Pop. Tales and Fictions,* ii, 289, seq. *The Wright's
Chaste Wife* is the *English fabliau* on the subject. M. Bédier, in his
recent work on *Les Fabliaux,* pp. 411 -- 13, denies the Eastern origin
of *the fabliau,* but in his Indiaphobia M. Bédier is *capable de tout.*
In the Indian version the various messengers are sent by the king to
test the chastity of a peerless wife of whom he has heard. The incident
occurs in some versions of the 'Battle of the Birds' story *(Celtic
Fairy Tales,* No. xxiv), and considering the wide spread of this in the
British Isles, it was possibly from this source that it came to
Deptford.

 

51\. SIR GAMMER VANS

SOURCE Halliwell's *Nursery Rhymes and Tales.  
*PARALLELS There is a Yorkshire Lying Tale in Henderson's *Folk-Lore,*
first edition, p. 337, a Suffolk one, 'Happy Borz'l', in *Suffolk Notes
and Queries,* while a similar jingle of inconsequent absurdities,
commencing 'So he died, and she unluckily married the barber, and a
great bear coming up the street popped his head into the window, saying,
"Do you sell any soap"?' is said to have been invented by Charles James
Fox to test Sheridan's memory, who repeated it after one hearing.
(Others attribute it to Foote.) Similar *Lugenmärchen* are given by the
Grimms, and discussed by them in their Notes, Mrs Hunt's translation,
ii, pp. 424, *435,* 442, 450, 452*,* cf. Crane, *Ital. Pop. Tales,* p.
263.  
REMARKS The reference to venison warrants, and bows and arrows seems to
argue considerable antiquity for this piece of nonsense. The honorific
prefix 'Sir' may in that case refer to clerkly qualities rather than to
knighthood.

 

52\. TOM HICKATHRIFT

SOURCE From the Chap-book, *c.*1660, in the Pepysian Library, edited for
the Villon Society by Mr G. L. Gomme. Mr Nutt, who kindly abridged it
for me, writes, 'Nothing in the shape of incident has been omitted, and
there has been no rewriting beyond a phrase here and there rendered
necessary by the process of abridgment. But I have in one case altered
the sequence of events putting the fight with the giant last.'  
PARALLELS There are similar adventures of giants in Hunt's Cornish
*Drolls.* Sir Francis Palgrave *(Quart. Rev.,* vol. xxi), and after him
Mr Gomme, have drawn attention to certain similarities with the Grettir
Saga, but they do not extend beyond general resemblances of great
strength. Mr Gomme, however, adds that the cartwheel 'plays a not
unimportant part in English folk-lore as a representative of old runic
faith' (Villon Soc. edition, p. xv).  
REMARKS Mr Gomme, in his interesting Introduction, points out several
indications of considerable antiquity for the legend, various
expressions in the Pepysian Chap-book ('in the marsh of the Isle of
Ely', 'good ground'), indicating that it could trace back to the
sixteenth century. On the other hand, there is evidence of local
tradition persisting from that time onward till the present day (Weaver,
*Funerall Monuments,* 1631, pp. 866 -- 7; Spelman, *Icenia,* 1640, p.
138; Dugdale, *Imbanking,* 1662 (ed. 1772, p. 244); Blomefield,
*Norfolk,* 1808, ix, pp. 79, 80). These refer to a sepulchral monument
in Tylney churchyard which had figured on a stone coffin an axle-tree
and cart-wheel. The name in these versions of the legend is given as
Hickifric, and he is there represented as a village Hampden who
withstood the tyranny of the local lord of the manor. Mr Gomme is
inclined to believe, I understand him, that there is a certain amount of
evidence for Tom Hickathrift being a historic personality round whom
some of the Scandinavian mythical exploits have gathered. I must refer
to his admirable Introduction for the ingenious line of reasoning on
which he bases these conclusions. Under any circumstances no English
child's library of folk-tales can be considered complete that does not
present a version of Mr Hickathrift's exploits.

 

53\. THE HEDLEY KOW

SOURCE Told to Mrs Balfour by Mrs M. of S. Northumberland. Mrs M.'s
mother told the tale as having happened to a person she had known when
young: she had herself seen the Hedley Kow twice, once as a donkey and
once as a wisp of straw. 'Kow' must not be confounded with the more
prosaic animal with a 'C'.  
PARALLELS There is a short reference to the Hedley Kow in Henderson,
l.c., first edition, pp. 234 -- 5. Our story is shortly referred to
thus: 'He would present himself to some old dame gathering sticks, in
the form of a truss of straw, which she would be sure to take up and
carry away. Then it would become so heavy that she would have to lay her
burden down, on which the straw would become "quick", rise upright and
shuffle away before her, till at last it vanished from her sight with a
laugh and shout.' Some of Robin Goodfellow's pranks are similar to those
of the Hedley Kow. The old woman's content with the changes is similar
to that of 'Mr Vinegar'. An ascending scale of changes has been studied
by Prof. Crane, *Italian Popular Tales,* p. 373.

 

54\. GOBBORN SEER

SOURCE Collected by Mrs Gomme from an old woman at Deptford. It is to be
remarked that 'Gobborn Seer' is Irish (Goban Saor = free carpenter), and
is the Irish equivalent of Wayland Smith, and occurs in several place
names in Ireland.  
PARALLELS The essence of the tale occurs in Kennedy, l.c., p. 67 seq.
Gobborn Seer's daughter was clearly the clever lass who is found in all
parts of the Indo-European world. An instance in my *Indian Fairy
Tales,* 'Why the Fish Laughed' (No. 24). She has been made a special
study by Prof. Child, *English and Scotch Ballads,* i, 485, while an
elaborate monograph by Prof. Benfey under the title 'Die Kiuge Dirne'
(reprinted in his *Kleine Schriften,* ii, 156 seq.), formed the occasion
for his first presentation of his now well-known hypothesis of the
derivation of all folk-tales from India.  
REMARKS But for the accident of the title being preserved there would
have been nothing to show that this tale had been imported into England
from Ireland, whither it had probably been carried all the way from
India.

 

55\. LAWKAMERCYME

SOURCE Halliwell, *Nursery Rhymes.  
*PARALLELS It is possible that this is an Eastern 'sell': it occurs at
any rate as the first episode in Fitzgerald's translation of Jami's
*Saldámán and Absál.* Jami, *ob.* 1492, introduces the story to
illustrate the perplexities of the problem of individuality in a
pantheistic system.

Lest, like the simple Arab in the tale,  
I grow perplext, O God ! 'twixt ME and THEE,  
If I -- this Spirit that inspires me whence?  
If THOU -- then what this sensual impotence?

In other words, M. Bourget's *Cruelle Enigme.* The Arab yokel coming to
Baghdad is fearful of losing his identity, and ties a pumpkin to his leg
before going to sleep. His companion transfers it to his own leg. The
yokel awaking is perplexed like the pantheist.

If I -- the pumpkin why on you?  
If you -- then where am I, and WHO?

 

56\. TATTERCOATS

SOURCE Told to Mrs Balfour by a little girl named Sally Brown, when she
lived in the Cars in Lincolnshire. Sally had got it from her mother, who
worked for Mrs Balfour. It was originally told in dialect, which Mrs
Balfour has omitted.  
PARALLELS Miss Cox has included 'Tattercoats' in her exhaustive
collection of parallels of *Cinderella* (Folk-Lore Society Publications,
1892), No. 274 from the MS. which I had lent her. Miss Cox rightly
classes it as 'Indeterminate', and it has only the *Menial Heroine* and
*Happy Marriage* episodes in common with stories of the Cinderella
type.  
REMARKS *Tattercoats* is of interest chiefly as being without any
'fairy' or supernatural elements, unless the magic pipe can be so
considered; it certainly gives the tale a fairy-like element. It is
practically a prose variant of *King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid,* and
is thus an instance of the folk-novel pure and simple, without any
admixture of those unnatural incidents which transform the folk-novel
into the serious folk-tale as we are accustomed to have it. Which is the
prior, folk-novel or tale, it would be hard to say.

 

57\. THE WEE BANNOCK

SOURCE Chambers's *Popular Rhymes of Scotland.* I have attempted an
impossibility, I fear, in trying to anglicise, but the fun of the
original tempted me. There still remain several technical trade terms
requiring elucidation. I owe the following to the kindness of the Rev.
Mr Todd Martin, of Belfast. *Lawtrod* = lap board on which the tailor
irons; *tow cards,* the comb with which tow is carded; the *clove,* a
heavy wooden knife for breaking up the flax. *Heckling* is combing it
with a *heckle* or wooden comb; *binnings* are halters for cattle made
of *spit* or rushes. *Spurtle* = spoon; *whins* = gorse.  
PARALLELS This is clearly a variant of *Johnny-cake* = journey-cake, No.
28, where see Notes.  
REMARKS But here the interest is with the pursuers rather than with the
pursued. The subtle characterisation of the various occupations reaches
a high level of artistic merit. Mr Barrie himself could scarcely have
succeeded better in a very difficult task.

 

58\. JOHNNY GLOKE

SOURCE Contributed by Mr W. Gregor to *Folk-Lore Journal,* vii. I have
rechristened 'Johnny Glaik' for the sake of the rhyme, and anglicised
the few Scotticisms.  
PARALLELS This is clearly *The Valiant Tailor* of the Grimms: '*x* at a
blow' has been bibliographised. (See my List of Incidents in Trans.
FolkLore Congress, 1892, *sub voce.)  
*REMARKS How *The Valiant Tailor* got to Aberdeen one cannot tell,
though the resemblance is close enough to suggest a direct 'lifting'
from some English version of Grimm's *Goblins.* At the same time it must
be remembered that *Jack the Giant-Killer* (see Notes on No. 19)
contains some of the incidents of

The Valiant Tailor.

 

59\. COAT O' CLAY

SOURCE Contributed by Mrs Balfour originally to *Longman's Magazine,*
and thence to *Folk-Lore,* Sept. 1890.  
REMARKS A rustic apologue, which is scarcely more than a prolonged pun
on 'Coat o' Clay'. Mrs Balfour's telling redeems it from the usual
dullness of folk-tales with a moral or a double meaning.

 

60\. THE THREE COWS

SOURCE Contributed to Henderson, I.c., pp. 321 -- 2, by the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould.  
PARALLELS The incident 'Bones together' occurs in *Rushen Coatie
(infra,* No. 70), and has been discussed by the Grimms, i, 399, and by
Prof. Köhler, *Or. und 0cc.,* ii, 680.

 

61\. THE BLINDED GIANT

SOURCE Henderson's *Folk-Lore of Northern Counties.* See also
*Folk-Lore.* PARALLELS Polyphemus in the Odyssey and the Celtic
parallels in *Celtic Fairy Tales,* No. v, 'Conall Yellowclaw'. The same
incident occurs in one of Sindbad's voyages.  
REMARKS Here we have another instance of the localisation of a
well-known myth. There can be little doubt that the version is
ultimately to be traced back to the Odyssey. The one-eyed giant, the
barred door, the escape through the blinded giant's legs in the skin of
a slaughtered animal, are a series of incidents that could not have
arisen independently and casually. Yet till lately the mill stood to
prove if the narrator lied, and every circumstance of local
particularity seemed to vouch for the autochthonous character of the
myth. The incident is an instructive one, and I have therefore included
it in this volume, though it is little more than an anecdote in its
present shape.

 

62\. SCRAPEFOOT

SOURCE Collected by Mr Batten from Mrs H., who heard it from her mother
over forty years ago.  
PARALLELS It is clearly a variant of Southey's *Three Bears* (No. 18).  
REMARKS This remarkable variant raises the question whether Southey did
anything more than transform Scrapefoot into his naughty old woman, who
in her turn has been transformed by popular tradition into the naughty
girl Silverhair. Mr Nutt ingeniously suggests that Southey heard the
story told of an old vixen, and mistook the rustic name of a female fox
for the metaphorical application to women of fox-like temper. Mrs H.'s
version to my mind has all the marks of priority. It is throughout an
animal tale, the touch at the end of the shaking the paws and the name
Scrapefoot are too *volkstümlich* to have been conscious variations on
Southey's tale. In introducing the story in his *Doctor,* the poet
laureate did not claim to do more than repeat a popular tale. I think
that there can be little doubt that in Mrs H.'s version we have now
recovered this in its original form. If this is so, we may here have one
more incident of the great Northern beast epic of bear and fox, on which
Prof. Krohn has written an instructive monograph, *Bür (Wolf) und Fuchs*
(Helsingfors, 1889).

 

63\. THE PEDLAR OF SWAFFHAM

SOURCE *Diary of Abraham de la Pryme* (Surtees Soc.) under date 10th
November 1699, but rewritten by Mr Nutt, who has retained the few
characteristic seventeenth-century touches of Pryme's dull and
colourless narration. There is a somewhat fuller account in Blomefleld's
*History of Norfolk,* vi, 211 -- 13, from Twysden's *Reminiscences,* ed.
Hearne, p. 299. In this there is a double treasure; the first in an iron
pot with a Latin inscription, which the pedlar, whose name is John
Chapman, does not understand. Inquiring its meaning from a learned
friend, he is told --

Under me doth lie  
Another much richer than I.

He accordingly digs deeper and finds another pot of gold.  
PARALLELS Blomefield refers to Fungerus, *Etymologicum Latino-Graecum,*
pp. 1110 -- 11, where the same story is told of a peasant of Dort, in
Holland, who was similarly directed to go to Kempen Bridge. Prof. E. B.
Cowell, who gives the passage from Fungerus in a special paper on the
subject in the *Journal of Philology,* vi, 189 -- 95, points out that
the same story occurs in the *Masádvi* of the Persian poet Jalaluddin,
whose *floruit* is A.D. 1260. Here a young spendthrift of Baghdad is
warned in a dream to repair to Cairo, with the usual result of being
referred back.  
REMARKS The artificial character of the incident is sufficient to
prevent its having occurred in reality or to more than one inventive
imagination. It must therefore have been brought to Europe from the East
and adapted to local conditions at Dort and Swaffham. Prof. Cowell
suggests that it was possibly adapted at the latter place to account for
the effigy of the pedlar and his dog.

 

64\. THE OLD WITCH

SOURCE Collected by Mrs Gomme at Deptford.  
PARALLELS I have a dim memory of hearing a similar tale in Australia in
1860. It is clearly parallel with the Grimms' *Frau Holle,* where the
good girl is rewarded and the bad punished in a similar way. Perrault's
*Toads and Diamonds* is of the same

genus.

 

65\. THE THREE WISHES

SOURCE Sternberg's *Folk-Lore of Northamptonshire,* 1851, but entirely
rewritten by Mr Nutt who has introduced from other variants one touch at
the close -- viz, the readiness of the wife to allow her husband to
remain disfigured.  
PARALLELS Perrault's *Trois Souhaits* is the same tale, and Mr Lang has
shown in his edition of Perrault (pp. xlii -- li) how widely spread is
the theme throughout the climes and the ages. I do not, however,
understand him to grant that they are all derived from one source --
that represented in the Indian *Pantschatantra.* In my *Aesop,* i, 140
-- 1, I have pointed out an earlier version in Phaedrus where it occurs
(as in the prose versions) as the fable of *Mercury and the two Women,*
one of whom wishes to see her babe when it has a beard; the other, that
everything she touches which she would find useful in her profession,
may follow her. The babe becomes bearded, and the other woman raising
her hand to wipe her eyes finds her nose following her hand --
denouement on which the scene closes. M. Bédier, as usual, denies the
Indian origin, *Les Fabliaux,* pp. 177 seq.  
REMARKS I have endeavoured to show, l.c., that the Phaedrine form is
ultimately to be derived from India, and there can be little doubt that
all the other variants, which are only variations on one idea, and that
an absurdly incongruous one, were derived from India in the last resort.
The case is strongest for drolls of this kind.

 

66\. THE BURIED MOON

SOURCE Mrs Balfour's 'Legends of the Lincolnshire Cars' in *Folk-Lore,*
ii, somewhat abridged and the dialect removed. The story was derived
from a little girl named Bratton, who declared she had heard it from her
'grannie'. Mrs Balfour thinks the girl's own weird imagination had much
to do with framing the details.  
REMARKS The tale is noteworthy as being distinctly mythical in
character, and yet collected within the last ten years from one of the
English peasantry. The conception of the moon as a beneficent being, the
natural enemy of the bogies and other dwellers of the dark, is natural
enough, but scarcely occurs, so far as I recollect, in other
mythological systems. There is, at any rate, nothing analogous in the
Grimms' treatment of the moon in their *Teutonic Mythology,* tr.
Stallybrass, pp. 701 -- 21.

 

67\. A SON OF ADAM

SOURCE From memory, by Mr E. Sidney Hartland, as heard by him from his
nurse in childhood.  
PARALLELS Jacques de Vitry, *Exempla,* ed. Prof. Crane, No. xiii, and
references given in notes, p. 139. It occurs in Swift and in modern
Italian folk-lore.  
REMARKS The *Exempla* were anecdotes, witty and otherwise, used by the
monks in their sermons to season their discourse. Often they must have
been derived from the folk of the period, and at first sight it might
seem that we had found still extant among the folk the story that had
been the original of Jacques de Vitry's *Exemplum.* But the theological
basis of the story shows clearly that it was originally a monkish
invention and came thence among the folk.

 

68\. THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD

SOURCE Percy, *Reliques.* The ballad form of the story has become such a
nursery classic that I had not the heart to 'prose' it. As Mr Allingham
remarks, it is the best of the ballads of the pedestrian order.  
PARALLELS The second of R. Yarrington's *Two Lamentable Tragedies,*
1601, has the same plot as the ballad. Several chap-books have been made
out of it, some of them enumerated by Halliwell's *Popular Histories*
(Percy Soc.) No. 18. From one of these I am in the fortunate position of
giving the names of the dramatis personae of this domestic tragedy.
Androgus was the wicked uncle, Pisaurus his brother who married Eugenia,
and their children in the wood were Cassander and little Kate. The
ruffians were appropriately named Rawbones and Woudkill. According to a
writer in 3 *Notes and Qyeries,* ix, 144, the traditional burial-place
of the children is pointed out in Norfolk. The ballad was known before
Percy, as it is mentioned in the *Spectator,* Nos. 80 and 179.  
REMARKS The only 'fairy' touch -- but what a touch ! -- the pall of
leaves collected by the robins.

 

69\. THE HOBYAHS

SOURCE *American Folk-Lore Journal,* iii, 173, contributed by Mr S. V.
Proudfit as current in a family deriving from Perth.  
REMARKS But for the assurance of the tale itself that Hobyahs are no
more, Mr Batten's portraits of them would have convinced me that they
were the bogies or spirits of the comma bacillus. Mr Proudfit remarks
that the cry 'Look me' was very impressive.

 

70\. A POTTLE O' BRAINS

SOURCE Contributed by Mrs Balfour to *Folk-Lore,* II.  
PARALLELS The fool's wife is clearly related to the Clever Lass of
'Gobborn Seer', where see Notes.  
REMARKS The fool is obviously of the same family as he of the 'Coat o'
Clay' (No. 59), if he is not actually identical with him. His adventures
might be regarded as a sequel to the former ones. The Noodle family is
strongly represented in English folk-tales, which would seem to confirm
Carlyle's celebrated statistical remark.

 

71\. THE KING OF ENGLAND

SOURCE Mr F. Hindes Groome, *In Gypsy Tents,* told him by John Roberts,
a Welsh gypsy, with a few slight changes and omission of passages
insisting upon the gypsy origin of the three helpful brothers.  
PARALLELS The king and his three sons are familiar figures in European
*märchen.* Slavonic parallels are enumerated by Leskien Brugman in their
*Lithauische Märchen,* notes on No. II, p. 542. The Sleeping Beauty is,
of course, found in Perrault.  
REMARKS The tale is scarcely a good example for Mr Hindes Groome's
contention (in *Transactions Folk-Lore Congress)* for the diffusion of
all folk-tales by means of gypsies as *colporteurs.* This is merely a
matter of evidence, and of evidence there is singularly little, though
it is indeed curious that one of Campbell's best-equipped informants
should turn out to be a gypsy. Even this fact, however, is not too well
substantiated.

 

72\. KING JOHN AND THE ABBOT

SOURCE 'Prosed' from the well-known ballad in Percy. I have changed the
first query: What am I worth? Answer: Twenty-nine pence - one less, I
ween, than the Lord. This would have sounded somewhat bold in prose.  
PARALLELS Vincent of Beauvais has the story, but the English version
comes from the German Joe Miller, Pauli's *Schimpf und Ernst,* No. lv,
p. 46, ed. Oestetley, where see his notes. The question I have omitted
exists there, and cannot have 'independently arisen'. Pauli was a
fifteenth-century worthy or unworthy.  
REMARKS Riddles were once on a time serious things to meddle with, as
witness Samson and the Sphynx, and other instances duly noted with his
customary erudition by Prof. Child in his comments on the ballad,
*English and Scotch Ballads,* i, 403 -- 14.

 

73\. RUSHEN COATIE

SOURCE I have concocted this English, or rather Scotch, Cinderella from
the various versions given in Miss Cox's remarkable collection of 345
variants of *Cinderella* (Folk-Lore Society, 1892); see *Parallels* for
an enumeration of those occurring in the British Isles. I have used Nos.
1 -- 3, 8 -- 10. I give my composite the title 'Rushen Coatie', to
differentiate it from any of the Scotch variants, and for the purposes
of a folk-lore experiment. If this book becomes generally used among
English-speaking peoples, it may possibly reintroduce this and other
tales among the folk. We should be able to trace this reintroduction by
the variation in titles. I have done the same with 'Nix Nought Nothing',
'Molly Whuppie', and 'Johnny Gloke'.  
PARALLELS Miss Cox's volume gives no less than 113 variants of the pure
type of Cinderella -- her type A. 'Cinderella, or the Fortunate Marriage
of a Despised Scullery-maid by Aid of an *Animal* God-mother through the
Test of a Slipper' -- such might be the explanatory title of a chap-book
dealing with the pure type of Cinderella. This is represented in Miss
Cox's book, so far as the British Isles are concerned, by no less than
seven variants, as follows: (i) Dr Blind, in *Archaerlogical Review,*
iii, 24 -- 27, 'Ashpitell' (from neighbourhood of Glasgow). (2) A. Lang,
in *Revue Celtique,* t. iii, reprinted in *Folk-Lore,* September 1890,
'Rashin Coatie' (from Morayshire). (3) Mr Gregor, in *Folk-Lore
Journal,* ii, 72 -- 74 (from Aberdeenshire), 'The Red Calf' -- alI these
in Lowland Scots. (4) Campbell, *Popular Tales,* No. xliii, ii, 286 seq.
'The Sharp Grey Sheep'. (5) Mr Sinclair, in *Celtic Mag.,* xiii, 454 --
65, 'Snow-white Maiden'. (6) Mr Macleod's variant communicated through
Mr Nurt to Miss Cox's volume, p. 533; and (7) Curtin, *Myths of
Ireland,* pp. 78 -- 92. 'Fair, Brown, and Trembling' -- these four in
Gaelic, the last in Erse. To these I would add (8, 9) Chambers's two
versions in *Pop. Rhymes of Scotland,* pp. 66 -- 68, 'Rashie coat',
though Miss Cox assimilates them to Type B, Catskin; and (10) a variant
of Dr Blind's version, unknown to Miss Cox, but given in 7 *Notes and
Queries,* x, 463 (Dunbartonshire). Mr Clouston has remarks on the raven
as omen-bird in his notes to Mrs Saxby's *Birds of Omen in Shetland*
(privately printed, 1893).

REMARKS In going over these various versions, the first and perhaps most
striking thing that comes out is the substantial agreement of the
variants in each *language.* The English, i.e. Scotch, variants go
together; the Gaelic ones agree to differ from the English. I can best
display this important agreement and difference by the accompanying two
tables, which give, in parallel columns, Miss Cox's abstracts of her
tabulations, in which each incident is shortly given in technical
phraseology. It is practically impossible to use the long tabulations
for comparative purposes without some such shorthand.

Now, in the 'English' versions there is practical unanimity in the
concluding portions of the tale. *Magic dresses -- Meeting-place
(Church) -- Flight -- Lost Shoe -- Shoe Marriage-test -- Mutilated foot
-- False Bride -- Bird witness -- Happy Marriage,* follow one another
with exemplary regularity in all four (six) versions. \[Chambers, II,
consists entirely of these incidents\] The introductory incidents vary
somewhat. Chambers has evidently a maimed version of the introduction of
Catskin (see No. 83). The remaining three enable us, however, to restore
with some confidence the Ur-Cinderella in English somewhat as follows:
*Helpful animal given by dying mother -- Ill-treated heroine -- Menial
heroine -- Ear cornucopia -- Spy on heroine -- Slaying by helpful animal
--Tasks -- Revivified bones.* I have attempted in my version to
reconstruct the 'English' Cinderella according to these formulae. It
will be observed that the helpful animal is helpful in two ways -- (a)
in helping the heroine to perform tasks; (b) in providing her with magic
dresses. It is the same with the Grimms' *Aschenputtel* and other
Continental variants.

Turning to the Celtic variants, these divide into two sets. Campbell's
and Macleod's versions are practically at one with the English formula,
the latter with an important variation which will concern us later. But
the other two, Curtin's and Sinclair's, one collected in Ireland, and
the other in Scotland, both continue the formula with the conclusion of
the Sea Maiden tale (on which see the Notes of my *Celtic Fairy Tales,*
No. xvii). This is a specifically Celtic formula, and would seem
therefore to claim Cinderella for the Celts. But the welding of the Sea
Maiden ending on to the Cinderella formula is clearly a later and
inartistic junction, and implies rather imperfect assimilation of the
Cinderella formula. To determine the question of origin we must turn to
the purer type given by the other two Celtic versions.

Campbell's tale can clearly lay no claim to represent the original type
of Cinderella. The golden shoes are a gift of the hero to the heroine
which destroys the whole point of the *Shoe marriage test,* and cannot
have been in the original, wherever it originated. Mr Macleod's version,
however, contains an incident which seems to bring us nearer to the
original form than any version contained in Miss Cox's book. Throughout
the variants it will be observed what an important function is played by
the helpful animal. This in some of the versions is left as a legacy by
the heroine's dying mother. But in Mr Macleod's version the helpful
animal, a sheep, is the heroine's mother herself ! This is indeed an
archaic touch, which seems to hark back to primitive times and
totemistic beliefs. And more important still, it is a touch which
vitalises the other variants in which the helpful animal is rather
dragged in by the horns. Mr Nutt's lucky find at the last moment seems
to throw more light on the origin of the tale than almost the whole of
the remaining collection.

But does this find necessarily prove an original Celtic origin for
Cinderella? Scarcely. It remains to be proved that this introductory
part of the story with helpful animal was necessarily part of the
original. Having regard to the feudal character underlying the whole
conception, it remains possible that the earlier part was ingeniously
dovetailed on to the latter from some pre-existing and more archaic
tale, perhaps that represented by the Grimms' *One Eye, Two Eyes, and
Three Eyes.* The possibility of the introduction of an archaic formula
which had become a convention of folk-telling cannot be left out of
account.

The 'Youngest-best' formula which occurs in Cinderella, and on which Mr
Lang laid much stress in his treatment of the subject in his 'Perrault'
as a survival of the old tenure of 'junior right', does not throw much
light on the subject. Mr Ralston, in the *Nineteenth Century,* 1879, was
equally unenlightening with his sun-myths.

 

74\. KING O' CATS

SOURCE I have taken a point here and a point there from the various
English versions mentioned in the next section. I have expanded the
names, so as to make a jingle from the Dildrum and Doldrum of
Hartland.  
PARALLELS Five variants of this quaint legend have been collected in
England: (1) Halliwell, *Pop. Rhymes,* 167, 'Molly Dixon'; (2) *Choice
Notes -- Folk-Lore,* p. 73, 'Colman Grey'; (3) *Folk--Lore Journal,* ii,
22, 'King o' the Cats'; (4) *Folk-Lore -- England* (Gibbings), 'Johnny
Reed's Cat'; (5) Hartland and Wilkinson, *Lancashire Legends,* p. 13,
'Dildrum Doldrum'. Sir F. Palgrave gives a Danish parallel; cf.
Halliwell, l.c.  
REMARKS An interesting example of the spread and development of a simple
anecdote throughout England. Here again we can scarcely imagine more
than a single origin for the tale which is, in its way, as weird and
fantastic as E. A. Poe.

 

75\. TAMLANE

SOURCE From Scott's *Minstrelsy,* with touches from the other variants
given by Prof. Child in his *Eng. and Scotch Ballads,* i, 335 -- 58*.  
*PARALLELS Prof. Child gives no less than nine versions in his masterly
edition, l.c., besides another fragment 'Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane',
i, 258. He parallels the marriage of Peleus and Thetis in Apollodorus
III, xiii, 5, 6, which still persists in modern Greece as a Cretan
ballad.  
REMARKS Prof. Child remarks that dipping into water or milk is necessary
before transformation can take place, and gives examples, l.c., 338, to
which may be added that of Catskin (see Notes *infra).* He gives as the
reason why the Elf-queen would have 'ta'en out Tamlane's two grey eyne',
so that henceforth he should not be able to see the fairies. Was it not
rather that he should not henceforth see Burd Janet ? -- a subtle touch
of jealousy. On dwelling in fairyland Mr Hartland has a monograph in his
*Science of Fairy Tales,* pp. 161 -- 254.

 

76\. THE STARS IN THE SKY

SOURCE Mrs Balfour's old nurse, now in New Zealand. The original is in
broad Scots, which I have anglicised.  
PARALLELS The tradition is widespread that at the foot of the rainbow
treasure is to be found; cf. Mr John Payne's 'Sir Edward's Questing' in
his *Songs of Life and Death.  
*REMARKS The 'sell' at the end is scarcely after the manner of the folk,
and various touches throughout indicate a transmission through minds
tainted with culture and introspection.

 

77\. NEWS!

SOURCE Bell's *Speaker.  
*PARALLELS Jacques de Vitry, *Exempla,* ed. Crane, No. ccv, a servant
being asked the news by his master returned from a pilgrimage to
Compostella, says the dog is lame, and goes on to explain: 'While the
dog was running near the mule, the mule kicked him and broke his own
halter and ran through the house scattering the fire with his hoofs, and
burning down your house with your wife.' It occurs even earlier in
Alfonsi's *Disciplina Clericalis,* No. xxx, at beginning of the twelfth
century, among the *Fabliaux,* and in Bebel, *Werke,* iii 71, whence
probably it was reintroduced into England. See Prof. Crane's note ad
loc.  
REMARKS Almost all Alfonsi's *exempla* are from the East. It is
characteristic that the German version finishes up with a loss of
honour, the English climax being loss of fortune.

 

78\. PUDDOCK, MOUSIE, AND RATTON

SOURCE Kirkpatrick Sharpe's *Ballad Book,* 1824, slightly anglicised.  
PARALLELS Mr Bullen, in his *Lyrics from Elizabethan Song Books,* p.
202, gives a version, 'The Marriage of the Frog and the Mouse', from T.
Ravenscroft's *Melismata,* 1611*.* The nursery rhyme of the frog who
would a-wooing go is clearly a variant of this, and has thus a sure
pedigree of three hundred years; cf. 'Frog husband' in my List of
Incidents, or notes to 'The Well of the World's End' (No. 41).

 

79\. LITTLE BULL-CALF

  
SOURCE *Gypsy Lore Journal,* iii, one of a number of tales told 'In a
Tent' to Mr John Sampson. I have respelt and euphemised the bladder.  
PARALLELS The Perseus and Andromeda incident is frequent in folk-tales;
see my List of Incidents *sub voce* 'Fight with Dragon'. 'Cheese
squeezing', as a test of prowess, is also common, as in 'Jack the
Giant-Killer' and elsewhere (Köhler, *Jahrbuch,* vii, 252).

 

80\. THE WEE WEE MANNIE

SOURCE From Mrs Balfour's old nurse. I have again anglicised.  
PARALLELS This is one of the class of accumulative stories like *The Old
Woman and her Pig* (No. 4). The class is well represented in these
isles.

 

81\. HABETROT AND SCANTLIE MAB

SOURCE Henderson's *Folk-Lore of Northern Counties,* pp. 258 -- 62 of
Folk-Lore Society's edition. I have abridged and to some extent
rewritten.  
PARALLELS This in its early part is a parallel to the *Tom Tit Tot,*
which see. The latter part is more novel, and is best compared with the
Grimms' *Spinners.  
*REMARKS Henderson makes out of Habetrot a goddess of the
spinning-wheel, but with very little authority as it seems to me.

  
  
82. OLD MOTHER WIGGLE-WAGGLE

SOURCE I have inserted into Halliwell's version one current in Mr
Batten's family, except that I have substituted 'Wiggle-Waggle' for
'Slipper-Slopper'. The two versions supplement one another.  
REMARKS This is a pure bit of animal satire, which might have come from
a rural Jefferies with somewhat more of wit than the native writer.

 

83\. CATSKIN

SOURCE From the chap-book reprinted in Halliwell I have introduced the
demand for magic dresses from Chambers's *Rashie Coat,* into which it
had clearly been interpolated from some version of Catskin.  
PARALLELS Miss Cox's admirable volume of variants of *Cinderella* also
contains seventy-three variants of *Catskin,* besides thirteen
'indeterminate' ones which approximate to that type. Of these
eighty-six, five exist in the British Isles, two chap-books given in
Halliwell and in Dixon's *Songs of English Peasantry,* two by Campbell,
Nos. xiv and xiv*a*, 'The King who Wished to Marry his Daughter', and
one by Kennedy's *Fireside Stories,* 'The Princess in the Catskins'.
Goldsmith knew the story by the name of 'Catskin', as he refers to it in
the *Vicar.* There is a fragment from Cornwall in *Folk-Lore,* i, App.
p. 149.  
REMARKS *Catskin, or the Wandering Gentlewomen,* now exists in English
only in two chap-book ballads. But Chambers's first variant of *Rashie
Coat* begins with the Catskin formula in a euphemised form. The full
formula may be said to run in abbreviated form *-- Death-bed promise --
Deceased wife's resemblance marriage test -- Unnatural father* (desiring
to marry his own *daughter) - Helpful animal -- Counter tasks -- Magic
dresses -- Heroine flight -- Heroine disguise -- Menial heroine --
Meeting-place -- Token objects named -- Threefold flight -- Lovesick
prince -- Recognition ring -- Happy marriage.* Of these the chap-book
versions contain scarcely anything of the opening motifs. Yet they
existed in England, for Miss Isabella Barclay, in a variant which Miss
Cox has overlooked *(Folk-Lore,* i, l.c.), remembers having heard the
Unnatural Father incident from a Cornish servant-girl. Campbell's two
versions also contain the incident, from which one of them receives its
name. One wonders in what form Mr Burchell knew Catskin, for 'he gave
the \[Primrose\] children the Buck of Beverland, \[Who knows the Buck of
Beverland nowadays?\] with the history of Patient Grissel, the
adventures of Catskin and the Fair Rosamond's Bower' *(Vicar of
Wakefield,* 1766, c. vi). Pity that 'Goldy' did not tell the story
himself, as he had probably heard it in Ireland, where Kennedy gives a
poor version in his

Fireside Stories.

Yet, imperfect as the chap-book versions are, they yet retain not a few
archaic touches. It is clear from them, at any rate, that the Heroine
was at one time transformed into a Cat. For when the basin of water is
thrown in her face she 'shakes her ears' just as a cat would. Again,
before putting on her magic dresses she bathes in a pellucid pool. Now,
Professor Child has pointed out in his notes on Tamlane and elsewhere
*(English and Scotch Ballads,* i, 338; ii, 505; iii, 505*)* that dipping
into water or milk is necessary before transformation can take place. It
is clear, therefore, that Catskin was originally transformed into an
animal by the spirit of her mother, also transformed into an animal. If
I understand Mr Nutt rightly *(Folk-Lore,* iv, 135, seq.), he is
inclined to think, from the evidence of the hero-tales which have the
unsavoury motif of the Unnatural Father, that the original home of the
story was England, where most of the hero-tales locate the incident. I
would merely remark on this that there are only very slight traces of
the story in these islands nowadays, while it abounds in Italy, which
possesses one almost perfect version of the formula (Miss Cox, No. 142,
from Sardinia).

Mr Newell, on the other hand *(American Folk-Lore Journal,* ii, 160),
considers Catskin the earliest of the three types contained in Miss
Cox's book, and considers that Cinderella was derived from this as a
softening of the original. His chief reason appears to be the earlier
appearance of Catskin in Straparola, \[it is practically in Des Perier's
*Récréations,* 1544.\] 1550, a hundred years earlier than Cinderella in
Basile, 1636. This appears to be a somewhat insufficient basis for such
a conclusion. Nor is there, after all, so close a relation between the
two types in their full development as to necessitate the derivation of
one from the other.

 

84\. STUPID'S CRIES

SOURCE *Folk-Lore Record,* iii, 152 -- 5, by the veteran Prof. Stephens.
I have changed 'dog and bitch' of original to 'dog and cat', and
euphemised the liver and lights.  
PARALLELS Prof. Stephens gives parallels from Denmark, Germany (the
Grimms' *Up Riesensohn)* and Ireland (Kennedy, *Fireside Stories,* p.
30).

 

85*.* THE LAMBTON WORM

SOURCE Henderson's *Folk-Lore of Northern Counties,* pp. 287 -- 9, I
have rewritten, as the original was rather high falutin'.  
PARALLELS Worms or dragons form the subject of the whole of the eighth
chapter of Henderson. 'The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh' (No. 33)
also requires the milk of nine kye for its daily rations, and cow's milk
is the ordinary provender of such kittle cattle (Grimms' *Teut. Myth.*
687), the mythological explanation being that cows = the clouds and the
dragon = the storm. Jephtha vows are also frequent in folk-tales: Miss
Cox gives many examples in her *Cinderella,* p. 511.  
REMARKS Nine generations back from the last of the Lambtons, Henry
Lambton, M.P., *ob.* 1761, reaches Sir John Lambton, Knight of Rhodes,
and several instances of violent death occur in the interim. Dragons are
possibly survivals into historic times of antedeluvian monsters, or
reminiscences of classical legend (Perseus, etc.). Who shall say which
is which, as Mr Lang would observe.

 

86\. WISE MEN OF GOTHAM

SOURCE The chap-book contained in Mr Hazlitt's *Shakesperian Jest Book,*
vol. iii. I have selected the incidents and modernised the spelling;
otherwise the droll remains as it was told in Elizabethan times.  
PARALLELS Mr Clouston's *Book of Noodles* is little else than a series
of parallels to our droll. See my List of Incidents under the titles,
'One cheese after another', 'Hare postman', 'Not counting self',
'Drowning eels'. In most cases Mr Clouston quotes Eastern analogies.  
REMARKS All countries have their special crop of fools, Boeotians among
the Greeks, the people of Hums among the Persians (how appropriate !),
the Schildburgers in Germany, and so on. Gotham is the English
representative, and as witticisms call to mind well-known wits, so
Gotham has had heaped on its head all the stupidities of the
Indo-European world. For there can be little doubt that these drolls
have spread from East to West. This 'Not counting self' is in the
*Gooroo Paramastan,* the cheeses 'one after another' in M. Rivière's
collection of Kabyle tales, and so on. It is indeed curious how little
originality there is among mankind in the matter of stupidity. Even such
an inventive genius as the late Mr Sothern had considerable difficulty
in inventing a new 'sell'.

 

87\. PRINCESS OF CANTERBURY

SOURCE I have inserted into the old chap-book version of the *Four Kings
of Colchester, Canterbury,* &c., an incident entitled by Halliwell 'The
Three Questions'.  
PARALLELS The 'riddle bride wager' is a frequent incident of folk-tales
(see my List of Incidents); the sleeping tabu of the latter part is not
so common, though it occurs, e.g., in the Grimms' *Twelve Princesses,*
who wear out their shoes with dancing.
