# Johnny Gloke

JOHNNY GLOKE was a tailor by trade, but like a man of spirit he grew
tired of his tailoring, and wished to follow some other path that would
lead to honour and fame. But he did not know what to do at first to gain
fame and fortune, so for a time he was fonder of basking idly in the sun
than in plying the needle and scissors. One warm day as he was enjoying
his ease, he was annoyed by the flies alighting on his bare ankles. He
brought his hand down on them with force and killed a goodly number of
them. On counting the victims of his valour, he was overjoyed at his
success; his heart rose to the doing of great deeds, and he gave vent to
his feelings in the saying:

'Well done! Johnny Gloke,  
Kilt fifty flies at one stroke.'

His resolution was now taken to cut out his path to fortune and honour.
So he took down from its resting-place a rusty old sword that had
belonged to some of his forebears, and set out in search of adventures.
After travelling a long way, he came to a country that was much troubled
by two giants, whom no one was bold enough to meet, and strong enough to
overcome. He was soon told of the giants, and learned that the king of
the country had offered a great reward and the hand of his daughter in
marriage to the man who should rid his land of this scourge. John's
heart rose to the deed, and he offered himself for the service. The
great haunt of the giants was a wood, and John set out with his old
sword to perform his task. When he reached the wood, he laid himself
down to think what course he would follow, for he knew how weak he was
compared to those he had undertaken to kill. He had not waited long,
when he saw them coming with a waggon to fetch wood for fuel. My! they
were big ones, with huge heads and long tusks for teeth. Johnny hid
himself in the hollow of a tree, thinking only of his own safety.
Feeling himself safe, he peeped out of his hiding-place, and watched the
two at work. Thus watching he formed his plan for action. He picked up a
pebble, threw it with force at one of them, and struck him a sharp blow
on the head. The giant in his pain turned at once on his companion, and
blamed him in strong words for hitting him. The other denied in anger
that he had thrown the pebble. John now saw himself on the high way to
gain his reward and the hand of the king's daughter. He kept still, and
carefully watched for an opportunity of striking another blow. He soon
found it, and right against the giant's head went another pebble. The
injured giant fell on his companion in fury, and the two belaboured each
other till they were utterly tired out. They sat down on a log to
breathe, rest, and recover themselves.

While sitting, one of them said, 'Well, all the king's army was not able
to take us, but I fear an old woman with a rope's end would be too much
for us now.'

'If that be so,' said Johnny Gloke, as he sprang, bold as a lion, from
his hiding-place, 'What do you say to Johnny Gloke with his old roosty
sword?' So saying he fell upon them, cut off their heads, and returned
in triumph. He received the king's daughter in marriage and for a time
lived in peace and happiness. He never told the mode he followed in his
dealing with the giants.

Some time after a rebellion broke out among the subjects of his
father-in-law. John, on the strength of his former valiant deed, was
chosen to quell the rebellion. His heart sank within him, but he could
not refuse and so lose his great name. He was mounted on the fiercest
horse that ever saw sun or wind, and set out on his desperate task. He
was not accustomed to ride on horseback, and he soon lost all control of
his steed. It galloped off at full speed, in the direction of the rebel
army. In its wild career it passed under the gallows that stood by the
wayside. The gallows was somewhat old and frail, and down it fell on the
horse's neck. Still the horse made no stop, but always forward at
furious speed towards the rebels. On seeing this strange sight
approaching towards them at such a speed they were seized with terror,
and cried out to one another, 'There comes Johnny Gloke that killed the
two giants with the gallows on his horse's neck to hang us all.' They
broke their ranks, fled in dismay, and never stopped till they reached
their homes. Thus was Johnny Gloke a second time victorious. So in due
time he came to the throne and lived a long, happy, and good life as
king.
