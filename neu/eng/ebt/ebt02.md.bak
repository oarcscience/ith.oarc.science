# TABLE OF ILLUSTRATIONS.

[FRONTISPIECE](ebt00.htm#img_front.md). Top. Castle Tomen, Radnor Forest,
1,250 feet above the sea, and is supposed to be the Cruger Castle of the
Itinerary of Giraldus. Background. A glade on a ley. Bottom. The Four
Stones, New Radnor, the easterly pair lined up for sighting over.

[PLATE I. PRIMARY PEAK](ebt04.htm#img_pl01.md). Titterstone Clee Hill, and
Park Hall, Bitterley.

[PLATE II. MOUNDS](ebt04.htm#img_pl02.md). 1, Tre-fedw, Pandy. The Skirrid,
a primary peak, in distance. 2, Didley. With homestead alongside.

[PLATE III. MOUND AND MOAT](ebt05.htm#img_pl03.md). 1, Houghton Mound. 2,
Lemore Moat. Note how slight is the dividing line between this type of
mound and a moat.

[PLATE IV. THREE-POINT PROOFS](ebt05.htm#img_pl04.md). 1 (a
telephotograph), Hereford Cathedral and Pen-y-Beacon. Here the camera
stood on a known ley in gateway near top of Hafod Hill, and the line
runs through pond at foot (marked by sheet of paper), tower of
Cathedral, and the 20 mile distant mountain point or bluff. Another ley
is seen crossing the meadow in a straight line just where "the lowing
herd winds slowly o'er the lea." 2, Tre-fedw Mound (see Plate II.),
shown at top of sighting line down present road to ancient Monnow ford
(alongside present bridge) at Llanvihangel Mill.

[PLATE V. SIGHTING CUTTINGS](ebt10.htm#img_pl05) (all telephotographs.md).
1, Notch with earthwork at Trewyn Camp above Pandy (Black Mountains). 2,
Cutting through top of ridge at Marstow, a bridge now spans it, and the
sighting line down to a ford on the Garron is indicated. The road beyond
the cutting is on the ley. 3, Black Darren, Longtown (Black Mountains).
This is taken from the Tan House, Longtown, and only 100 yards to right
or left the notch begins to lessen and then disappear.

[PLATE VI. CAUSEWAYS](ebt10.htm#img_pl06.md). 1, Through pond near Ten
Houses (now Priory Terrace), Holmer. Note the unmistakable direction,
confirmed on map. 2, Through the River Monnow, behind Tan House,
Longtown. A piece of fine engineering, the below-stream edge of large
stones embedded in grouting or concrete. This ley is over the notch in
Plate V.

[PLATE VII. CAUSEWAYS](ebt14.htm#img_pl07.md). 1, Over a ford of Olchon
Brook, Longtown. 2, Ingestone, Ross. Through the "fold" and straight to
the centre of the pond against the house. I cannot assign a period to
any of these.

[PLATE VIII. LEYS DISPLAYED](ebt14.htm#img_pl08.md). 1, Rhiw (mountain
track) south of Llanthony Abbey, Mon. This is sighted for Balmawr on the
ridge, and shows that where possible even mountain side tracks were kept
straight. Taken in evening light and shows (on left) the triple tracks
down which it is surmised the tile stones for roofing the Abbey to have
been slid from the quarry on the top. 2, Stones at base of ancient
Wye-side causeway at Bartonsham (formerly Bassam) Farm, Hereford City.
The stones continue in a "wash-out" in bed of river to right, and the
ley is sighted over tumps at Hoggs Mount and Holmer Lane. Note on bank
to right the mark-stone for the ford (see Plate IX.).

[PLATE IX. MARK-STONES](ebt19.htm#img_pl09.md). 1, Red Lion, Madley. On a
"red line" ley from the Whitney pottery. Note subsequent boundary stone
alongside. 2, Credenhill. 3, Wye Street, Hereford, marking the Palace
Ford; there are a pair of these stones. Bartonsham Farm, Hereford (see
Plate VIII.).

[PLATE X. TRANSITION OF MARK-STONE TO CROSS](ebt19.htm#img_pl10.md).

1, Wergin's Stone, Sutton. With flat face suited for sighting. A cavity
for payments (or offerings) on the flat base. Early example of "shaft
and base." 2, Pedlars Cross above Llanigon. A menhir chipped into rude
semblance of a cross. 3, In churchyard, Vowchurch, unworked base. A ley
runs through it. Inset, Sighting hole in shaft of Bitterley Cross. 4, In
Capel-y-fin churchyard (Black Mountains).

[PLATE XI. CHURCHYARD CROSS](ebt24.htm#img_pl11.md). Bitterley (see Inset
Plate X.).

[PLATE XII. TREE](ebt24.htm#img_pl12.md). Eastwood Oak, Tarrington, on a
ley.

[PLATE XIII. TREES](ebt26.htm#img_pl13.md). 1, A "One Tree Hill" near
Llanvihangel-nant-Melan. 2, Monnington Walks, an avenue of Scotch Firs
(Scots Pines) on a ley sighted on Scar Rock, Brobury, seen in distance.

sighting mounds, there being four, a pair at eastern end, a pair at this
the western end. 2, Herefordshire Beacon. Winds Point to the left.

detached tower of Ledbury Church is shown on the ley.

[PLATE XVI. CASTLE](ebt29.htm#img_pl16.md). Wigmore Castle. The keep is on
a sighting mound, the ley passing also through the church, as is almost
invariable where castle and church are near together.

sighting mound) with Coxall Knoll, another mound, in the distance on the
right.
