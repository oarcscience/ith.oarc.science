### PREVIOUS DATA.

A number of observers have recorded confirmatory facts.

Mr. G. H. Piper ("Woolhope Club Transactions, 1882," p. 176) says: "A
line drawn from the Skerrid-fawr (mountain) northwards to Arthur's Stone
would pass over the camp and the southernmost point of the Hatterill
Hill, Old Castle, Longtown Castle, and Urishay and Snodhill Castles."

Mr. Thos. Codrington ("Roman Roads in Britain," 1903) says: "Between the
extreme points there are many straight pieces not quite in the same
line, generally pointing to some landmark. There are several instances
where a barrow or tumulus was the landmark, the road passing round it on
nearing it. Silbury affords one example, and Brinklow, on the Foss,
another."

Mr. James G. Wood ("Woolhope Club Transactions, 1910," p. 146) says:
"The origin and purposes of these tumps associated with Roman roads will
well repay investigation. I have traced a line of such works across
South Monmouthshire and West Gloucestershire from Caerleon through
Caerwent into the Forest. All of these are so placed that each is in
sight of the next in either direction. Again, we find that such roads
were in many cases ranged or laid out in line with small camps or such
tumuli-being, in fact, surveying stations."

The Rev. S. Baring-Gould ("Book of Dartmoor," 1900) says: "The stone row
is almost invariably associated with cairns and kistvaens. They do not
always run parallel; they start from a cairn and end with a blocking
stone set across the line."

The Rev. S. Bentley ("History of Bosbury," 1891) says: "Under the cross
in the churchyard, at its removal to its present site in 1796, a huge
shapeless mass of rock weighing upwards of two tons was found. This
stone now lies in the churchyard close to the tower on the south side."
Another writer refers to it as "this large unhewn mass of Silurian
rock."

Mr. Hillaire Belloc ("The Old Road," 1904), writing of the Pilgrim's
Way, says: "Now on its way from Winchester to Canterbury the Old Road
passes, not in the mere proximity of, but right up against, thirteen
ruined or existing churches."

Mr. Belloc also says: "The sacredness of wells is commingled all through
Christendom with that of altars"; and giving Continental instances, also
refers to the one under the altar at Winchester.
