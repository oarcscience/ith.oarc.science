### INDIVIDUALITY OF A LEY.

Each ley or track was as separate and distinct from other leys as each
animal or tree is an organism distinct from other animals or trees. As
they crossed each other, no doubt users often transferred from one to
the other at the crossing, and struck out in an altered direction, hence
the place name element "turn." But the way thus travelled was a route,
not a road. It is an absurdity to speak of a sighted road having
branches, or bending. Each individual track was "a long lane that has no
turning."

Previous writers, treating, say, of Roman or of mediæval roads, not
knowing of the existence of the ley, assume that they are speaking of
original primary structures, when they are only describing a route
evolved from a number of the leys I describe, retaining the sighted
structure in the case of Roman roads, but losing most of it by mediæval
times.

Many leys acquired in after ages individual names from the use they were
put to, and such names were transferred to the sighting points.

I find in several cases a group of leys with sighting points passing
quite close to, and taking no notice of, quite a distinct group of leys
with other sighting points, the two sets being either of two different
periods, or part of separate systems made by different sets of ley-men
living in different districts.

A most surprising fact is the enormous number of leys.
