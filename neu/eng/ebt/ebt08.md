### ANTIQUITY OF THE LEY.

The word "ancient" covers a vast period. If--as I have proved--the tumps
or burys are sighting tumps, excavations also prove that they usually
date back to the Neolithic age, which, according to Mr. Ault's recent
"Early Life in Britain," cannot be later than 2,000 B.C., and may be
4,000 B.C. A prehistoric trackway might, therefore, be planned and made
more than three thousand years before the Old Road (which is a route
rather than a road) was devised or evolved--as Mr. Belloc so well
describes--as a Pilgrim's Way from Winchester to Canterbury.

I have found that the persistent things down the ages are not the
courses of the roads or tracks, but their sighting points, and that
cross roads with a place name are such. Place names are also persistent,
some of them going back to prehistoric times, but others evidently
mediæval. But the real dating of the leys and when the system fell into
decay is for future investigation.
