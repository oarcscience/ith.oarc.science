### EARTH CUTTINGS.

Where a mountain ridge stood in the path of a ley, the surveyor, instead
of building a tump on the ridge as a sighting point, often cut a trench
at the right angle and in the path of the ley. This shows as a notch
against the sky and makes a most efficient sighting point from below. I
have counted eight such artificial notches in the mountain ridge when on
the road from Llanvihangel Crucorney to Longtown. Each notch can only be
seen on the line of sight, and disappears when a quarter of a mile right
or left. They are sometimes emphasised (as at Trewyn Camp) by an earth
work thrown up on one side. The Wych on the Malvern ridge is an
instance.

The two fine gaps near Flansford (Goodrich) and Marstow ([Plate
V](ebt10.htm#img_pl05)..md), both with bridges over them, are also ancient
sighting cuttings.

The sighting cuttings were also used in passing over banks in lower
ground. Cullis is one of the names for such an earth cutting, as
Portcullis between Withington and Preston Wynne, and High Cullis above
Gatley Park, recently visited by the Club.

There is a very neat example of such a cutting at Hungerstone, near
Allensmore, where the cutting in the bank allows the ley to be sighted
on to a pond on its way to the next tump, the one close to the church at
Thruxton.

The word hunger (a common place-name element) indicates, I think, a
cutting through a bank, not the bank itself, as now surmised. There are
cuttings at most fords, which permit the water to be seen from above and
serve as sighting points. The cutting near Charing Cross, which gives
the name to the present Hungerford foot-bridge, probably came down
through Inigo Jones' beautiful Water Gate.

Mr. Codrington in his book on Roman Roads describes the method used by
Roman engineers "well known to surveyors for laying out a straight line
between extreme points not visible from each other, from two or more
intermediate points from which the extreme points are visible. By
shifting the intermediate points alternately all are brought to lie in a
straight line." This method was evidently used for all the leys.
