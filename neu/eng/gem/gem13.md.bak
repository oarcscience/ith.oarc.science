# BOOK XII

### CHAPTER I

<span class="margnote">Ethelfrid and Cadvan</span><span
class="smallcaps">Thereafter</span> all the princes of the Britons did
come together in the city of Leicester, and took common counsel that
they would make Cadvan their King, and that under his command they would
pursue Ethelfrid beyond the Humber. When they had set the crown of the
kingdom upon his head, they all assembled together from all parts and
crossed the Humber. And when message of this was brought unto Ethelfrid
he allied all the Kings of the Saxons unto himself and marched to meet
Cadvan. But when they had marshalled their companies on both sides their
friends came and made peace betwixt then on these conditions, that they
should possess Britain, Ethelfrid on the further side Humber, and Cadvan
on the hither side. And after that they had confirmed this covenant by
oath and giving of hostages, such a friendship sprang up betwixt them as
that they had all things in common. In the meanwhile it so fell out that
Ethelfrid did drive forth his own wife and took unto himself another,
and in such hatred did he hold her that he had driven forth that he
banished her from the kingdom of Northumbria. Whereupon, for that
Ethelfrid was father of her child as yet unborn, she went unto King
Cadvan,

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="margnote">Cadwallo and Edwin</span>beseeching his
intervention that she might be restored unto her husband. And when he
might in no wise persuade Ethelfrid to grant her petition she abode in
Cadvan's household until such time as she was delivered of a son. Now, a
little later, a son was born unto King Cadvan of the Queen his wife, and
thereafter were the two boys, whereof the one was called Cadwallo and
the other Edwin, nurtured together as became princes of the blood royal.
And when in course of time their boyhood had grown into youth, their
parents sent them unto Solomon, King of the Armorican Britons, that in
his household they might learn the lessons of knighthood and the customs
of courtly manners. They accordingly were received of him kindly and
diligently cared for, soon beginning to be admitted to his familiarity,
in such sort that none other was there of their age in his court that
could be more private with the King or speak unto him more merrily
withal. At last they did often do battle before him in encounter with
his enemies, and did win much fame of their valour in many exploits of
prowess.

### CHAPTER II

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> later days, after the death of their
parents, they returned into Britain, and, taking over the helm of the
kingdom, renewed the friendship that had been betwixt their fathers.
After two years had passed away, Edwin besought Cadwallo that he might
have a crown of his own, and fulfil the constituted ceremonies of
sovereignty in the parts

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

<span class="margnote">Brian's speech</span>of Northumbria in such wise
as he himself fulfilled them according to ancient wont upon the hither
side of the Humber. And when a conference was being held upon the matter
nigh the river Duglas, and the wiser sort were taking counsel together
what were best to be done, Cadwallo chanced to be lying on the other
bank of the river with his head resting on the bosom of a certain nephew
of his whom they called Brian. And whilst the messengers brought him
word what was being said upon both sides at the conference, Brian wept,
and the tears flowing from his eyes did so fall as that they bedewed the
King's face and his beard. The King, weening that it was a shower of
rain, lifted up his head, and seeing that the youth was all melted in
tears, asked him the cause of this sudden sorrow. Unto whom he made
answer:

'Good cause have I to weep continually and the British people no less,
for that ever since the country was visited by the invasion of these
barbarians in the days of Malgo never hath she known a prince that might
avail to restore her unto her ancient dignity. And now even the petty
residue of her honour is being minished by thy sufferance, seeing that
these Saxon adventurers, who have ever proved traitors unto her, must
now begin to share with her the honours of the kingly crown. For, once
let them be exalted by having a king of their own, they will be held of
so much higher renown in the country from whence they came as that ready
enow will their fellow-barbarians be to come at their call, when they
bid them to our shores to assist them in the

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

<span class="margnote">Cadwallo refuseth Edwin</span>extermination of
our race. For ever hath it been their wont to deal treacherously, nor
never keep firm faith with none. Wherefore, say I, by us ought they ever
more to be not exalted but cast down. When King Vortigern first took
them into his service as retainers, they abode here as under a shadowy
show of peace, as though they were ready to fight for our country, but
as soon as ever they were strong enough openly to manifest their
wickedness and to return evil for good they did betray him and wrought
grievous slaughter upon the people of his kingdom. Next they did betray
Aurelius Ambrosius, unto whom, after vowing the most awful sacraments of
allegiance, they gave poison as he sat at meat with them at a banquet.
Next, they betrayed Arthur, when, .casting aside the allegiance they
owed him, they fought against him with his nephew Mordred. Last of all,
belying their fealty unto King Careticus, they brought in upon him
Gormund, 'King of the Africans, by whose invasion hath the country been
reft from the people and the King himself driven forth with shame.'

### CHAPTER III

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> he spake thus, Cadwallo repented him
of having harboured the thought of such a covenant, and sent word unto
Edwin that he could in no wise persuade his counsellors to agree upon
his granting Edwin's petition, for that they said it was against right,
and against the ancient traditions of the island that the single
sovereignty of

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

<span class="margnote">The wizard Pellitus</span>the crown should be
divided betwixt two crowned heads. Thereat Edwin waxed wroth, and
dismissing the conference, he retired into Northumbria, saying that he
would wear Cadwallo's crown maugre his head, which, when Cadwallo
understood, he sent back word that he would smite off his head under the
crown if he durst presume to be crowned within the kingdom of Britain.

### CHAPTER IV

<span class="smallcaps">Discord</span> having thus arisen betwixt them,
and the men of both having harried the lands of the other in a number of
armed forays, both at last met on the further side of Humber, and in the
battle that was fought Cadwallo lost many thousands of his men and was
put to flight, making his way in such haste as he might through Albany
unto the island of Hibernia. But Edwin, after he had won the victory,
led his army through the provinces of Britain, and burning the cities,
did grievously torment the citizens and husbandmen. But whilst that he
was thus giving a loose unto his cruelty, Cadwallo was ever endeavouring
to return unto his country by ships, but could never make shift to do
so, for that unto whatsoever haven he steered his course there was Edwin
with his host to meet him and forbid his landing. Now there was come
unto him a certain right cunning wizard out of Spain, by name Pellitus,
who was learned in the flight of birds and the courses of the stars, and
did foretell unto him all disaster that might befall, and along

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="margnote">Brian's new art</span>of him it was that Edwin
had witting of Cadwallo's return so as thus he was able to meet him,
shatter his ships and drown their crews, and close every port against
him. Cadwallo, therefore, not knowing what to do, and well-nigh falling
into utter despair of ever returning, at last bethought him or going
unto Solomon, King of the Armorican Britons, to ask for help and
counsel, so that he might be able to return unto his country. And as he
was making sail for Armorica a wild gale arose of a sudden and the ships
of his companions were so scattered thereby, as that in a short space no
one of them remained by another. The pilot of the King's ship was
smitten with such terror that he let go the rudder and committed the
ship to the guidance of hazard, so that all that night they lay in peril
of death while she tossed hither and thither upon the heaving of the
billows. At dawn upon the morrow they made a certain island that is
called Garnarey, where with sore travail they made shift to come ashore.
Howbeit, Cadwallo was seized of so sore grief for the loss of his
shipmates that for three days and nights he loathed all food and lay
sick abed. But upon the fourth day early he was taken with a mighty
longing for venison meat, and calling Brian unto him told him what it
was that he did most desire. Brian thereupon took his bow and quiver,
and went throughout the island, so that if good luck should bring any
deer in his way he might take back meat thereof unto Cadwallo. And when
he had searched it from end to end without finding that whereof he was
in quest, he was in grievous straits for that he might not fulfil his
lord's desire,

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

<span class="margnote">Solomon of Brittany</span>and sore adread lest
his sickness should end in his death were he unable to satisfy his
longing. He fell therefore upon practising a new art. He cut open his
own thigh and took therefrom a slice of the flesh, and making a spit
ready did toast the same thereon and bore it unto the King for venison.
Presently, he, weening it to be flesh of deer, began to eat thereof, and
was mightily refreshed, much marvelling that never aforetime had he
tasted meat so sweet in flavour. At last, when he had eaten his fill, he
was of merrier and lighter cheer, insomuch as that after three days he
was all sound and whole again. Then, for the wind stood fair, they make
ready the ship's outfit, and hoisting sail embark on their deep-sea
voyage and make for the city of Kidalet. Then, coming unto King Solomon,
they are of him received right kindly as was beseeming men so
worshipful, and when he learnt the reason of their coming thither he
promised them his help in these words:

### CHAPTER V

'<span class="smallcaps">Sore</span> grief is it unto us, most noble
youths, that the land of your grandsires should be thus oppressed of a
barbarous folk, and that ye have been ignominiously driven forth from
thence. Yet, natheless, seeing that others be able to defend their
realms, a marvel is it, meseemeth, that your people should have lost an
island so fruitful, and are unable to make stand against this nation of
the Angles, whom our own men here do count as nought. For whilst the
folk of this my Britain

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

<span class="margnote">succoureth Cadwallo</span>did dwell along with
your own folk in your own Britain they did hold dominion over all
kingdoms of the provinces, nor was there a people anywhere, save only
the Roman people, strong enow to subjugate them. Nor were the Romans
themselves able to do this that I have said of their own might, but
through the strife that had arisen amongst the nobles of the island. But
the Romans, albeit that they held it subject for a time, yet after their
rulers were either lost to the island or slain, did either themselves
retire therefrom, or else were driven out with shame. But after the
Britons came into the province under their Dukes Maximian and Conan, the
residue that remained behind have never thereafter enjoyed such
privilege as to hold possession of the crown of the kingdom in unbroken
succession. For albeit that many of their princes have maintained the
ancient dignity of their forefathers, yet a still greater number of
feebler heirs have succeeded them who have lost it utterly when their
enemies did invade them. Hence do I grieve over the weakness of your
country, for that ye be come of the same blood as ourselves, and are
therefore called Britons no less than are our own folk, who, as ye see,
do hold our own against all our neighbours in arms.'

### CHAPTER VI

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> he had made an end of speaking thus,
with more to like purpose, Cadwallo, some little shamed, made answer on
this wise:

'Manifold thanks do I render unto thee, O

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="margnote">Cadwallo's speech</span>King, "sprung of grandsires
whose great grandsires were kings," for that thou hast promised to help
me to recover my kingdom. Howbeit, this which thou saidst, that it is
marvellous my people have not maintained their ancestral dignity
sithence the Britons did come into those provinces meseemeth is in no
wise a marvel. For the more noble of the whole realm did follow the
Dukes thou hast named, and only the ignoble did remain behind and did
possess them of their lands and honours. These, thus suddenly raised to
noble rank, were puffed up by their new dignities far beyond their
predecessors. They were purse-proud by reason of the abundance of their
riches; they waxed wanton for that no sense of honour did restrain their
lust. Amongst them, moreover, did prevail that which is the overthrow of
all that is good, the hatred of truth and of them that assert the
truth—the love of a lie and of them that do forge lies, the acceptance
of the evil for the good, the reverence of iniquity rather than of
charity, the acknowledgment of Satan as an angel of light. Kings were
anointed not for God's sake, but for that they were more cruel than
others; and were murdered but a brief while thereafter by them that did
anoint them, not by examination of the truth of any charge against them,
but for that they had chosen others yet more cruel in their stead. If
any of them were more merciful or did seem, even were it but a little,
to show favour unto truth, against him as the subverter of Britain were
hurled all the weapons of their hatred. Lastly, all things whatsoever
that were pleasing or displeasing unto God they weighed as

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="margnote">Bretons and Britons</span>of equal account in the
balance, if indeed the things that were hateful did not turn the scale.
Therefore did they all things that were contrary to the safety of the
people, as though the True Physician of all men were unwilling to bestow
healing upon them. And all this was done not only by worldly laymen, but
even by the Lord's own flock and the shepherds thereof without
distinction. No cause for marvel, therefore, is it that such degenerate
ones, hated of God for sins so grievous, should have lost the country
they had on this wise polluted. For God was minded to take vengeance
upon them when He suffered a nation of strangers to overrun them and
drive us out of the fields that our fathers did possess. Natheless, a
worthy deed it were, so God allow, to restore our people unto their
ancient dignity, but it should be a lasting reproach unto our race, that
we were feeble rulers, who in this our time laboured nought to maintain
our rights. Moreover, I do with the more confidence beseech thy help for
that we had both one great-grandfather's grandfather. For Malgo, that
mighty King of Britain who reigned fourth after Arthur, begat two sons,
whereof the one was called Ennian and the other Runo. Ennian was father
of Jago, Jago of Cadvan, my father. But Runo, who after his brother's
death was driven forth by the invasion of the Saxons, did come hither
into this province, and gave his daughter unto Duke Hoel, the son of
Hoel the Great, who conquered so many kingdoms with Arthur. Unto him was
born Alan, the father of thine own father Hoel, who, so long as he
lived, was no small terror unto the Gauls.['](errata.htm#4.md)

### CHAPTER VII

<span class="margnote">Brian cometh to York</span><span
class="smallcaps">In</span> the meantime, while he was spending the
winter with Solomon, they made resolve that Brian should cross over into
Britain and by some means or other make away with King Edwin's wizard
lest by his wonted craft he should forewarn him of Cadwallo's coming.
Accordingly, after he had landed at Hamo's port, he did upon him the
garments of a certain poor man, feigning him to be the poor man himself.
He wrought him a staff of iron sharp at the end wherewith to slay the
wizard in case he should chance to fall in with him, and then made his
way to York, in the which city Edwin was at that time sojourning. And
when he was come thither he joined him with a company of poor men that
waited for alms before the King's door. And whilst that he was pacing to
and fro, behold, his sister came forth of the great hall, with an ewer
in her hand wherein she was carrying water unto the Queen. She had been
carried off by Edwin from the city of Worcester what time he was
wreaking havoc in the provinces of the Britons after the flight of
Cadwallo. When, therefore, she passed in front of Brian, he knew her at
once, and with eyes overflowing with tears called unto her in a low
voice. The damsel, turning her head at his voice, was at first in doubt
who it might be, but when she drew nigher and recognised her brother,
she was like to have fallen in a swoon for dread lest by any mishap he
should be known and taken by his enemies. Wherefore, deferring kisses
and familiar greetings

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

<span class="margnote">and slayeth Pellitus</span>for the time, she
spake with him as though she were talking of some other indifferent
matter, and told him briefly how the buildings of the court lay,
pointing them out, and pointing out also the wizard of whom he was in
search, who chanced to be walking up and down amongst the poor men
whilst the alms was being distributed unto them. Brian, therefore, when
he had taken knowledge of the man, bade his sister steal privily forth
of her chamber the next night and come unto him without the city hard by
a certain old church where he would await her coming among the dark
arches of the place. He then joined him in amongst the throng of poor
folk in that part where Pellitus was setting them in place, and the
moment there was an opening to smite him, he lifted up the pilgrim's
staff I have already spoken of and thrust it in under the wizard's
chest, and slew him with that same blow. Instantly he dropped the staff
amongst the throng, and passed on unnoticed, so that none suspected him,
and by God's grace made shift to reach the hiding-place I have
mentioned. But when night came on, his sister, who tried every endeavour
to get forth and join him, found that get forth she could not, for that
Edwin, affrighted at the murder of Pellitus, had set watchers round the
court, who, spying into every hidden corner, denied all means of issue.
When Brian made discovery of this, he betook him away from that place
and went unto Exeter, where he called the Britons together and made
known unto them what he had done. Then, sending messengers unto
Cadwallo, he garrisoned that city and sent word unto all the barons of
the

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="margnote">Cadwallo returneth to Britain</span>Britons to see to
the defences of their castles and cities, and await in gladness the
coming of Cadwallo, who, having secured the succour of Solomon, was
shortly about to undertake their defence. These tidings being bruited
throughout the whole island, Peanda, King of the Mercians, with a mighty
multitude of Saxons, came to Exeter and beleaguered Brian therein.

### CHAPTER VIII

<span class="smallcaps">Meanwhile</span> Cadwallo landed in Britain with
ten thousand men whom King Solomon had placed under his command, and
soon made his way towards Exeter where King Peanda was holding the
leaguer; and when he drew anigh, he divided his men into four companies
and lost no time before he fell upon the enemy. And when he joined
battle, Peanda was forthwith taken prisoner and his army utterly put to
the rout. And when he saw that none other way of safety was open to him
he made his submission unto Cadwallo, and gave hostages, pledging him to
do battle along with hint against the Saxons. Having thus won the
victory over him, Cadwallo called his barons together, who for a long
time past had slipped out of his hands, and made for Northumbria against
Edwin, never ceasing to lay waste the country on his march. When this
was reported unto Edwin, he summoned all the petty Kings of the Angles
to join him, and, meeting Cadwallo in the field that is called
Hevenfeld, did battle with the Britons. The fighting was quickly over.

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="margnote">and defeateth all enemies</span>Edwin was slain and
well-nigh all the folk he had with him, as also was his son Offrid, and
Godbold, King of the Orkneys, who had come to help him.

### CHAPTER IX

<span class="smallcaps">Having</span> obtained this victory, Cadwallo
marched through all the provinces of the Angles, and wrought such havoc
upon the Saxons as that scarce would he spare the womankind or the
tender years of their little ones, putting all that he found to most
grievous torture, forasmuch as he was minded utterly to sweep the
English race out of the bounds of Britain. Then next he fought a battle
with Osric, who had succeeded Edwin, and slew him with his two nephews
who ought of right to have reigned after him, as also slew he Adan, King
of the Scots, who had come to their assistance.

### CHAPTER X

<span class="smallcaps">After</span> all these were slain, Oswald
succeeded to the kingdom of Northumberland, whom, with the rest of them
that had fought against him, Cadwallo drove fleeing before him as far as
the wall in that province which Severus the Emperor had builded of old
betwixt England and Scotland. Then, afterward, he sent Peanda, King of
the Mercians, and the more part of his army unto that place to do battle
with him. But Oswald, one night when he was beleaguered by the aforesaid
Peanda in the place called Hevenfeld, that is the Field of

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="margnote">Peanda slayeth Oswald</span>Heaven, did there set up a
Cross of the Lord, and gave orders unto his fellow-soldiers that they
should cry aloud at the very topmost of their voices in these words:
'Let us all bend our knees before the living and true God Almighty,
beseeching Him with one accord that He deliver us from the proud army of
the British King and of his accursed commander Peanda, for He Himself
knoweth that we have undertaken these just wars for the salvation of our
country.' All did according as they had been commanded, and, marching
forth against the enemy at early dawn, they did achieve the victory
which the merit of their faith had deserved. When word of this was
brought unto Cadwallo, he, blazing out into fiery wrath, collected his
army and followed in pursuit of the holy King Oswald, and in the midst
of a battle that was fought at the place called Bourne, Peanda did fall
upon him and slay him.

### CHAPTER XI

<span class="smallcaps">Oswald</span> being thus slain along with many
thousands of his men, his brother Oswi succeeded him in the kingdom of
Northumbria, and by dint of heavy bribes of gold and silver given to
Cadwallo, who now possessed the empire of all Britain, did obtain his
peace and became his vassal. Thereupon his brother Alfrid, and
Ethelwald, his brother's son, raised an insurrection against him. But
when they found that they could in no wise stand against him, they fled
away unto Peanda, King of the Mercians, imploring him that he would
collect an

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="margnote">Oswi hatcheth treason</span>army and go with them
to the further side Humber to reave Oswi of his kingdom. But Peanda, for
that he was adread of breaking the peace which King Cadwallo had
established throughout the realm of Britain, deferred starting any
disturbance without his leave until such time as he could in some way or
another work upon him either to march against King Oswi himself, or at
least grant him licence to do battle with him. When, therefore, King
Cadwallo held high court one Whitsuntide and celebrated the festival by
wearing the crown of Britain in London, and all of the Kings of the
Angles save Oswi alone, and all the Dukes of the Britons were present,
Peanda went unto the King and asked hint wherefore Oswi alone was absent
when all the rest of the princes of the Saxons were there? And when
Cadwallo made answer that it was by reason of a sickness that lay upon
him, Peanda went on to tell him that Oswi had sent for Saxons into
Germany that he might revenge the death of his brother Oswald upon them
both. He added, moreover, that he had broken the King's peace, seeing
that he alone had begun the war and contention betwixt them when he had
driven Ethelfrid, King of Northumbria, and Ethelwald, his brother's son,
forth of their kingdom by levying war against them. He did therefore
further beseech leave to be allowed either to slay him or to drive him
forth of his kingdom.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

### CHAPTER XII

<span class="margnote">Margadud: his speech</span><span
class="smallcaps">The</span> King, therefore, whose own thoughts were
somewhat divided betwixt the divers aspects of the matter, called his
familiars apart and bade them declare their opinions upon a case of the
kind. And after much counsel had been given, Margadud, King of the South
Welsh, spake amongst the rest:

'My Lord, seeing that it hath ever been thy purpose to drive the race of
the Angles forth of the frontiers of Britain, wherefore shouldst thou
now turn aside from thy resolve and suffer them to live in peace in our
midst? Go to, now! Give them leave at least to fall out amongst
themselves and slaughter one another at will until they shall have
exterminated themselves from our land! No faith is to be kept with one
that is ever hatching of treason and laying of snares to catch him unto
whom of right he oweth fealty. These Saxons, in sooth, ever since they
did first set foot in our country, have never done naught but lurk in
ambush to betray our folk. What faith ought we to keep with them? Give
Peanda leave to make war upon Oswi the swiftest he may, that thus they
may kill one another in civil discord to their hearts’ content and our
island be rid of the whole pack of them!'

### CHAPTER XIII

<span class="smallcaps">With</span> these and many other words, Cadwallo
was prevailed upon to grant Peanda leave to do battle

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

<span class="margnote">Peanda slain</span>with Oswi. Peanda accordingly
got together a huge army, marched to the Humber, and laying waste that
province of the country, began to harass that King in bitter earnest.
Oswi, thereby reduced to his last shift, promised him numberless right
royal treasures and bribes beyond all belief to put an end to the havoc
he was wreaking, abandon the invasion he had begun and go quietly home.
And when he found that he could in no wise prevail upon him to grant his
entreaties, the King, relying on divine succour, albeit that his army
were the smaller, gave him battle nigh the river Winned, and won a
victory wherein Peanda, together with thirty Dukes, was slain. Peanda
being thus killed, Wulfred his son, by grant of Cadwallo, succeeded him
in the kingdom. He, leaguing himself with Ebba and Edbert, Dukes of the
Mercians, rebelled against Oswi, but at the command of Cadwallo made
peace with him. At last, at the end of eight-and-forty years, Cadwallo,
that most noble and puissant King of the Britons, borne down by old age
and sickness, departed this life upon the fifteenth of the Kalends of
December. The Britons embalmed his body with balsams and sweet-scented
condiments, and set it with marvellous art within a brazen image cast to
the measure of his stature. This image, moreover, in armour of wondrous
beauty and craftsmanship, they set upon a brazen horse above the West
Gate of London in token of the victory I have spoken of, and as a terror
unto the Saxons. They did likewise build beneath it a church in honour
of St. Martin, wherein are divine services celebrated for him and the
faithful departed.

### CHAPTER XIV

<span class="margnote">Cadwallader made King</span><span
class="smallcaps">Cadwallader</span> his son succeeded him in the
government of the kingdom, a youth whom Bede calleth Elidwald. In the
beginning he maintained him stoutly and made good peace, but after he
had worn the crown twelve years he fell into feeble health and civil
dissension brake out amongst the Britons. His mother was the sister of
Peanda but only on her father's side, Peanda being born of a different
mother; she was sprung from a noble family of the Gewissi. It was after
King Cadwallo had entered into the covenant of amity with her brother
Peanda that he took her to wife and that she bare him Cadwallader.

### CHAPTER XV

<span class="smallcaps">He</span>, therefore, as I began to tell ye,
falling sick, the Britons begin to quarrel, and by their accursed
discords destroy the wealth of the country. A second calamity, moreover,
followeth on the first, for a deadly and memorable famine fell upon the
foolish folk, insomuch as that every province was empty of all
sustenance of food, save only such partial provision as the huntsman's
art could supply. And upon the heels of this famine followed a
pestilence of death so grievous as that in a brief space so great was
the multitude of people laid low, the living were not enough to bury the
dead. By reason whereof, the miserable remnant of the people forsaking
their own country in flocks did

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

<span class="margnote">Cadwallader's lament</span>make their way unto
lands oversea, with mighty lamentation chanting under the folds of the
sails: 'Thou hast given us, O God, even as sheep unto the slaughter, and
amongst the nations hast Thou scattered us.' Yea, even King Cadwallader
himself, voyaging with his wretched fleet for Armorica, did make
addition unto the lamentation on this wise: 'Woe unto us, miserable
sinners, for our grievous iniquities wherewith we have never ceased to
offend against God so long as space was granted unto us for repentance!
Wherefore the vengeance of His might lieth thus heavy upon us, and doth
uproot us from our native soil, albeit that never were the Romans of old
nor after them the Scots nor the Picts nor even the crafty treasons of
the Saxons able to exterminate our people. In vain have we so oft
recovered our country from them, seeing that it was not God's will we
should reign therein for ever. He, the true Judge, when He saw that in
no wise were we minded to cease from our iniquities and that no man
could drive us forth of the kingdom, willed Himself to chastise our
folly, and hath now directed against us this visitation of His wrath
whereby we are compelled to forsake our own country by multitudes at a
time. Now, therefore, return ye Romans; ye Scots and Picts return;
return, ye Ambrons and Saxons! Behold, Britain lieth open unto ye! She
that never might ye avail to dispeople, hath by the wrath of God been
now left desolate! Not your valour driveth us forth, but the might of
Him that is over all, the God whom never hath our people been slow to
offend.'

### CHAPTER XVI

<span class="margnote">The Saxons return</span><span
class="smallcaps">In</span> the midst of these and other lamentations
was Cadwallader borne forth unto the Armorican shore, and upon his
landing, came with all his multitude unto King Alan, nephew of Solomon,
and by hint was worthily received. Britain, therefore, deserted of all
her people save some few whom death had spared in the parts of Wales for
a space of eleven years together, became a place abhorred even of the
Britons themselves; nor, in sooth, did the Saxons find it a home to be
desired at that same time, for they, too, died therein without
intermission. But when the deadly plague had ceased, the remnant of
them, true unto their ancient wont, sent word unto their
fellow-countrymen in Germany, telling them that now the island of
Britain was deserted of her own people they might lightly take
possession thereof, so only they would come together and dwell therein.
So, when they understood these tidings, that accursed folk, collecting a
countless host of men and women, landed in the parts of Northumbria and
inhabited the desolated provinces from Albany even unto Cornwall. For
none indweller was there to say them nay, save only the few and needy
little remnants of the Britons that had survived and herded together in
the forest fastnesses of Wales. From that time the power of the Britons
ceased in the island, and the English began to reign.

### CHAPTER XVII

<span class="margnote">The Britons shall prevail hereafter</span><span
class="smallcaps">Then</span>, after some brief space of time had
elapsed and the Saxon people had thus been reinforced, Cadwallader,
bethinking him that his kingdom was now purged from the contagion of the
plague, besought help of Alan that he might be restored unto his former
kingdom. But when the King had granted his petition, behold, even as he
was fitting out his fleet, the Voice of an Angel spake unto him in
thunder, forbidding him to emprise the adventure, for that God had
willed the Britons should no longer reign in Britain before that time
should come whereof Merlin had prophesied unto Arthur. The Voice bade
him, moreover, that he should go unto Pope Sergius at Rome, where, after
due penance done, he should be numbered amongst the blessed. Yet,
further, the Voice told him that the people of the Britons should again
possess the island by merit of their faith when the appointed time
should come, but that this time should not be until the Britons had
obtained his relics and had translated them from Rome into Britain.
Then, when the relics had likewise been revealed of the other saints,
which had been hidden away by reason of the invasion of the Paynims,
they should recover the kingdom they had lost. And when this message had
been spoken in the ears of the holy man, he went straightway unto King
Alan and made known unto him that which had been revealed unto himself.

### CHAPTER XVIII

<span class="margnote">Cadwallader dieth</span><span
class="smallcaps">Then</span> Alan took divers books, as that of the
prophecies of the Eagle that did prophesy at Shaftesbury, and of the
songs of Sibyl and Merlin, and began to search all things that were
therein to see whether Cadwallader's revelation did agree with the
written oracles. And when he found no discrepancy therein, he did
counsel Cadwallader to be obedient unto the divine dispensation, and
foregoing all thought of recovering Britain, to perform that which the
angelic monition had bidden him. He counselled him, moreover, to send
his son Ivor and his nephew Ini to rule over the remnant of the Britons
in the island, lest the people born of their ancient race should lose
their freedom by the invasion of the barbarians. Then Cadwallader,
renouncing worldly things for the sake of God and His kingdom
everlasting, came unto Rome, and was confirmed by Pope Sergius, and no
long time after, being smitten of a sudden lethargy, upon the twelfth
day of the Kalends of May in the year of Our Lord's incarnation, six
hundred and eighty-nine, was released from the contagion of the flesh
and did enter into the hall of the kingdom of Heaven.

### CHAPTER XIX

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> Ivor and Ini had got ships together,
they raised all the men they could, and made for the island, where for
nine-and-forty years they harassed

<span class="margnote">Of the Welsh</span>the English people, and did
most cruelly raid their lands, but all to little avail. For the said
pestilence and famine and customary dissensions had so caused this proud
people to degenerate that they could no longer keep their foes at a
distance. And, as barbarism crept in, they were no longer called Britons
but Welsh, a word derived either from Gualo, one of their Dukes, or from
Guales, their Queen, or else from their being barbarians. But the Saxons
did wiselier, kept peace and concord amongst themselves, tilled their
fields and builded anew their cities and castles, and thus throwing off
the sovereignty of the Britons, held the empire of all Loegria under
their Duke Athelstan, who was the first to wear a crown amongst them.
But the Welsh, degenerating from the nobility of the Britons, never
afterwards recovered the sovereignty of the island, but on the contrary,
quarrelling at one time amongst themselves, and at another with the
Saxons, never ceased to have bloodshed on hand either in public or
private feud.

William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon, whom I bid be silent as
