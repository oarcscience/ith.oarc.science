Chapter III

By the Peat Filled Hearth.

<span id="img_14"></span> ![](img/14.jpg)

 

WHEN the labours of the day are over, and darkness has fallen upon the
moor, the dwellers in the lonely hill-farms gather round the hearth upon
which the peat fire is burning, oblivious of the cold without, and the
winter winds which are howling over the heath. At the present day, when
communication with the outer world is frequent, and the local weekly
paper finds its way into many of the farm-houses, the doings in the
market towns and villages bordering the moor, and even what is
transpiring further afield, form, next to such matters as immediately
concern them, the principal topics of conversation. But before the
advent of the telegraph and railways this was not so. Outside the
moorland settlement hut little of what was passing was known. The news
of events taking place in the great towns frequently never reached the
lonely farm-house on the moor until several weeks after their
occurrence, and often matters of great moment, arid affecting all the
people of the land, had arisen arid been settled ere those dwelling in
remote districts had learnt anything of what was going forward. The
beIief in charms and witchcraft was fostered by this isolation from the
world, and ancient superstitions retained their hold of the country
folk. The doings of the pixies were diligently related, and the rustic
listened with eagerness to the details of various wonderful deeds, with
the performance of which the elfin tribe was credited.

But we will lift the curtain upon the past, and witness, unseen, what is
taking place in the kitchen of a moor-land farm-house. "'Tis sixty years
since," and a dark winter night, and there by the peat-piled hearth the
good folks of the house are gathered, so if we listen we shall perchance
learn from them something of what the pixies are said to do.

Let us first describe this old-fashioned farm-kitchen, and then look
around upon the little company within it.

It is a low apartment, paved with large flags of granite, and the walls
are plastered and coated with whitewash. Overhead the beams supporting
the floor of the room above are seen, for there is no ceiling, and
these, too, were originally whitened, but the smoke from the peat fire
has changed the colour to a dirty yellow. Pieces of wood roughly nailed
across the beams, form racks, which contain several large flitches of
bacon, dry and brown, and though they may perhaps be not particularly
ornamental, are an immediate assurance to the beholder that he need be
in no fear of dying from starvation should he chance to be "snowed up"
within the house at any time during the winter. At one end of the
kitchen a "dresser" stands, upon which are arranged a goodly number of
plates and dishes, with jugs and cups of an andque pattern, and beside
it, in a worm-eaten oaken case, stands the clock, ticking with a loud,
solemn tick. A long deal table, scrupulously clean, is placed on the
side where is the window, the latter being closed with shutters, and
fastened by a thick bar. On the wooden chimney-piece are a pair of brass
candlesticks, and a brass pestal and mortar, all very bright, a tinder
box, and two white china dogs, with black ears and gilt collars, and
various other small articles. Above the shelf, supported on nails driven
into the wall, is a gun, and hanging to another nail is an odd spur,
while along one of the beams i fishing rod finds a place, resting also
on nails, and looking as if it had seen a great deal of service. One
corner of the room is occupied by a cupboard, with a glazed door, inside
which are seen some china articles, but these are only brought out on
particular occasions, when, perhaps, "quality" may chance to pay a visit
to the house, and he entertained at the hospitable hoard. A " settle "
is placed obliquely in front of the hearth, springing from one corner of
it, and acts a partition, dividing the main portion of the room from the
fireside. A lighted candle is set upon the table in a tin candlestick
with an immense flat stand, but the kitchen is illuminated chiefly by
the cheerful blaze from a faggot thrown on the top of the peat, over
which a large kettle is suspended by an iron "crook" hanging down from
the vast chimney. The slow and solemn tick, tick, of the old fashioned
clock, with the incessant chirping of a cricket in the chimney corner,
are plainly heard when time conversation occasionally ceases, and above
all is the sound of the howling wind, blowing in violent gusts around
the corners of the house.

Seated on the "settle" are the farmer and his eldest son, while two
younger ones occupy stools in the corner of the spacious hearth, and
quite close to the glowing pile of peat, evidently enjoying the genial
warmth. On a low chair, on the opposite side of the fire to the '
settle," sits the white-haired old grandfather, and at one end of the
long table, engaged in knitting, is the farmer's wife, the other being
occupied by a rosy checked damsel who is ironing some small linen
articles.

A footstep is heard without, causing the little company to Iook towards
the door, which opens and admits a neighbour--a moor-man \[a\]--for an
hour or two's chat with the good people. He is at once welcomed, and
without any ceremony takes a seat on the " settle," seemingly not at all
sorry to find himself by the cosy fireside.

" 'Tis mortal cold tonight, sure 'nuff,'' he exclaims; 'the wind's a
blawin' that strong I was a most carried off my legs, comin' along.''

"Ees, 'tis brave and stormy, sure,' replies the farmer; " I would'n
covet to go far 'pon such a night. Us ant got auver the winter cet."

"No, us ant," says the new-corner. "Farmer Frainch's missis is a gone to
Ashburton, and as it's com' in so dark like, he's a gone out against
her; I don't envy he he's job."

"Gone to Ashburton, has her ' " says the farmer, '' Ah-a.''

A short pause ensues, which is broken by the old grandfather. "Only hark
to that now," he exclaims, calling attention to the chirping of the
cricket; "if the pisgies could only heer't, how they would dance to It,
to be sure, for that be the music for they''

You be right, uncle," says the moor-man, " they be gert hands for
dancin', by all account, and like the cricket's music as well as
anything. Anyway they tell mite that's the cause." \[b\]

"Is it? " asks one of the lads in time chimney corner, looking eagerly
up, while the other glances around the kitchen, as if almost expecting
to see the little elves appear.

"Zo they zay,'' answers the moor-man, " though I never zeed wan, for all
that.''

"Nor I didn' never zee wan, nither," remarks the farmer, " but I b'leve
feyther hev,--hev'n ee feyther?"

"I've a heerd mun," replies the grandfather," an I've a zeed specks a
floatin' about like, in the air, but I can't zay that I ever actually
catched sight of a pisgie, though I've a known they that hev."

"They be mortal curious little vokes, they be," exclaims the moor-man,
with the air of a man who is stating something which he is confident
cannot be disputed, "mortal curious."

"Ees, they'm zackly like that," acquiesces the grandfather;" they'll
craip droo any little cranny. Why, I've a heerd of mun gettin droo
key-holes and hidin' away in cracks you couldn't put your little finger
in. They'll zometimes com' and blaw out the candle you've got in your
hand, and you can't zee mun do it."

" But they do do it fast enough," exclaims the rosy cheeked girl,
pausing in her work, " vur 'twas only the other night one blawed out
mine, just as I got to the chamber door."

"Did ee zee un? " enquires the moor-man.

No, I didn', but I knawed 'twas a pisgie, cause there wudn' nobody else
there to do it, and the light went out zackly as I got to the door."

"Bless your saul! " says the moor-man.

"They'll play all sorts o' may games" continues the ancient authority
upon the doings of the elfin race. Zometimes they'll com' and kiss the
maidens behind the door. "--

"Did ee ever hev 'em do that, 'Liza? '' enquires the moor-man, looking
slyly at the farmer.

"T for tellin'," replies the girl, her cheeks growing redder, if such be
possible. "I bant gwain to say nothin' about that."

The farmer's son on the "settle," who has been greatly interested in the
conversation, suddenly seems to be impressed with the conviction that
the fire needs attending to, for he stoops down and busies himself with
piling several slabs of peal upon it, and which seems to take some time
for him to accomplish to his satisfaction.

"The pisgies bant no good for nort like that, be um, 'Liza? '' continues
the moorman, winking at the farmer beside him.

" No, they bant," replies 'Liza.

"But you knaw who is, though, don't ee now? insinuates the bantering
visitor, glancing towards the farmer's son, who with a shamefaced look
is still occupied in heaping peat on the fire, a proceeding which
appears perfectly unnecessary.

"Get along with ee, do," cries 'Liza, working hard with her flat iron; "
you ought for to knaw better."

The moor-man's only reply is a loud laugh, followed by an admonition to
the damsel relative to getting herself into a "tantrum," and an
expression of his firm conviction that such will by no means be
conducive to her comfort.

This is followed by a few moment's silence, during which the
white-haired grandfather has apparently been deeply absorbed in thought,
and the farmer's son has left the fire alone, and now seems to be
getting more comfortable. The old man at length re-commences his talk
about the pixies, and it is evident that he has been trying to recollect
something of their antics during the pause in the conversation.

"They there pisgies,'' be begins, '' 'II talk up the queerest old trade
you ever heerd. Zometimes you cant make it out at all. But they'll work
all the time, though, at what they've com' upon, vur they do say that
they be sent out to do arrants, and that nothin'll stop mun from carrin'
mun out, unless you spy 'em.''

"Ees, I've heerd that, too,'' says the moor-man.

"But you can soon frighten 'em, if you only catch a sight o' mun,--they
don't like to be spied at.''

"Nither doth 'Liza when she's behind the door,'' exclaims the moor-man,
with a grin; "and I don't blame her."

'Liza pretends to he very much annoyed at the remark, but it is easy to
perceive that the banter of the visitor is not unpleasing to her.

They be mortal fond of water, they pisgies," the old man goes on, not
heeding the interruption, '' and they'll do lots of cures for ee if you
only set a basin full o't somewhere handy for mun. Trait mun well, and
they'll never do no harm to nobody, but if you don't, they'll pay ee out
vur't .''

"I've a heerd my missis tell," says the moor-man, "that her've a knawed
mun to upset the saucepan out o' spite, when they've a been traited in a
manner they didn' like, and to turn the milk sour, too."

"Way they've a done that here," cries 'Liza, "lots o' times, thought
what us have done to vex the little toads, I dun knaw."

"You hadn' better let mun hear ee spaik of mun like that, 'Liza,''
remarks the grandfather, '' vur they'll sure to make ee smart vur't.''

"I don't want to spaik no harm about mun, but they've a plagued us here
many times, as missis knaws, and I could never tell what us had a done
to mun to make mun spiteful. I've a zeed a lot o' their antics."

"Way you've a knawd mun at all their pranks,'Liza, cepts the kissin',''
exclaims the moor-man; '' but there, you bant no loser by that, 'cause
you've a got somebody else to do that for ee." And the speaker again
bursts out into a loud laugh, while the farmer's son all at once
conceives the idea that the fire will be greatly improved by the
addition of a huge bundle of furze, but seems to be somewhat unfortunate
in his endeavours to place it in position--at all events as long a time
is consumed in doing so as was taken up by his efforts to pile the peat.

Again time cricket is heard upon the hearth, and the chock goes off with
its solemn tick, tick, while the hiimniug fmmr crat-kics mierrily up the
chimney.

"At wan time the pisgies used to com' about more'n they do now," the
grandfather continues, "and thought I can't call home half of what l've
heerd about mun, yet I do mind how they used to be knawed to be up to
their pranks a most every night. I've a heerd tell about mun poundin'
apples and makin' butter, and doing all sorts o' things, and zometimes
us used to put a penny 'pon the table as wages vur mun, of a night time,
and they'd com' and put the house to rights vur us, and take the money
away with mun''

"To think o' that, now," says the moor-man.

"Aw, ees, us was nivr against doin' that when I was a boy, home wi'
feyther and mothmer,--but that more'n seventy year agone."

"You'm a brave age now, uncle," the moor-man remarks.

"I shall be eighty-four com' Michaelmas, If I live," answers the old
man; "and l've got zome work in me eet, as John knaws."

That you hey, feyther," says the farmer, " but I don't wish ee to do
nort, vur all that. You've a had your share, and 'tis time vur ee now to
sit down and be comfortable."

"Law bless ee, what's that?" suddenly cries 'Liza, dropping her flat
iron, and glancing with a scared look towards time door. " I heerd
zomething like zinging just outside!"

" 'Tis the pisgies, 'Liza, an' if they com', mind 'tis only ou who've
called mun names," exclaims the moor-man. The two lads in the chimney
corner look rather frightened, and draw chose to one another.

"Way I never said nothin' against mun," says 'Liza, evidently rather
alarmed. " I'm sure I would'n hurt wan for the world."

"I'll go and zee what 'tis," says the farmer, rising and going towards
the door; " here, Shep!" This latter exclamation causes an old sheep dog
to pull himself, yawning and stretching, from underneath the table,
where he has been comfortably sleeping. 'Liza picks up her flat iron,
and edges back further into the room, getting much nearer to the
farmer's son, who feeling himself under the obligation of saying
something to quiet the damsel's fears, hastens to assure her that he
will not suffer the pixies to ''tich'' her. With such a protector, 'Liza
is almost enabled to forget her dread of the "little people, " and
plucking up courage looks towards the door with some degree of
composure.

This the farmer has now thrown open, and is peering out into the
darkness. 'The wind comes in great gusts, roaring across the moor, and
it seems in vain to listen for the sounds of voices in such a tempest.
At last he ventures out a few steps, but almost immediately returns, and
the alacrity which he displays in stepping across the threshold causes
the inmates of the kitchen to look anxiously towards him. The roses on
'Liza's cheeks begin to grow pale again.

"What is it? " asks the moor-man.

"I can't tell ee," replies the farmer, '' I can heer zomething like
zomebody calling or singing, but I can't zee nort."

"Well," says the old grandfather, who has caught the reply, "I can't
make et out. 'Tis zackly like the pisgies; you can hear mun, hut they
can't he zeed; but I zim they'd never be out 'pon such a night as this.
They always choose bright moonlight nights if they can."

"May be 'tis the black dog that haunts the moor," suggests the moor-man.

"Do ee think 'tis? " exclaims 'Liza, getting still closer to the
farmer's son.

"I'll go out and zee what's there," says the farmer, '' I bant feared.
Come on Shep.''

"Don't thee make a fool of thyself, and go rinnin into danger, when
there's no call for't," says his wife, putting down her knitting.

But the farmer heeds her not, and disappears into the darkness, while
the curiosity of each member of the little party being thoroughly
aroused, they anxiously await his return. The howling of the wind
prevents them from hearing the sounds which had struck upon the ear of
the master of the house, but their imagination easily supplies them, and
they look at one another without opening their lips. The moor-man has
got up, and stands by the open door.

Suddenly Shep commences to bark, and his master is heard calling to him,
and bidding him be quiet.

"It bant no pisgies," says the grandfather; " it be too stormy for
they."

"Gran'fer knaws," says the farmer's son, hoping by such an assurance to
still any lingering apprehensions on 'Liza's part.

"Hark! ' cries the moor-man, '' I hear maister hollerin' again."

"He must be mazed to go out 'pon such a arrant," says his wife; if he
don't mind he'll meet with wishtness."

The farmer is now heard approaching the door, and it is evident that he
is not unaccompanied. A moment later he appears with a buxom dame
wrapped in a heavy cloak.

"Way 'tis Mrs. Frainch! " cries the moor-man, as he recognizes who it is
the farmer brings with him, and us thought 'twas--aw! aw! aw! But
where's maister? '' he asks, alluding to the good woman's husband,
"outside?"

"I ant zeed nort of 'm,'' answers the buxom female, taking a seat near
the farmer's wife " he ant come out, I reckon.'

"Ees, he hev,'' the moor-man asserts, '' I knaw he hev. An you 'ant a
zeed un?"

"No, I ant. But you don't really main what you say?"

"I do, sure,'' replies the moor-man; '' he went out against ee a good
bit agone. I can't make out how 'tis you ant zeed nort of un.''

The farmer's son, who upon the entrance of the dame had gone to see
after her horse, now enters the kitchen, and takes his seat once more
upon the "settle," 'Liza, all cause for fear being now removed, resumes
her ironing.

"What a night 'tis to be sure," exclaims the dame, throwing off her
heavy cloak; "and what a ride I've a had across Hole Moor. 'Tis so dark
as a baig, and brave and windy."

"Ees you be right,'' the moor-man observes; ''but I can't help thinking
about your man. I'm zartin sure he's a gone to mait ee."

"However could he ha' missed me, then? '' asks the good dame. I've a
keeped in the track all the way along,--or as near as I was able
to,--and can't make out how 'tis us have'n a mait. How long's he bin
gone, Dick?"

"Aw a brave long time. Why he must a got into Hole avaur now," replies
the moor-man.

"I stopped there comin' along, zo they'll tell'n I'm gone homeward,"
says the dame.

"I was thinkin' zo. A pooty tantrum he'll be in when he vinds he's a had
he's walk for nothin', and 'pon such a night, too."

"Aw, I dun knaw,--it takes a good bit to put ee out."

"Well, ees, I zim he's always very pleasant tempered."

"I s'pose I'd better wait fer'n a bit," remarks the dame, " perhaps he
wan't be long, now."

Half-an-hour elapses, and the inmates are still wondering what can keep
the dame's husband away so long, when suddenly the door is opened, and
he makes his appearance. He is a tall, portly man, and his jolly red
face wears a most cheery look, and he seems altogether a most suitable
mate for the buxom dame who awaits his arrival.

''Well, did ee think I was lost?" he exclaims in a hearty tone. ''I've
had a round, sure nuff. How be' varmer?" he asks, addressing the master
of the house and you too, missis; you'm very well, I haup,''--and then,
without waiting to hear the reply, he turns to his good dame, and says
in a tone which evinces the pleasure he feels at seeing her, "well,
mother, you'm got back, I zee, and a good thing too; if you'd a bin
where I hev, we should hev had a pooty job.'

"Where hev ee bin too, then?'' asks his dame how comed he to be so
stupid as to go an' miss me like that.''

"Well, I can't tell ee more'n this. I've a bin pisgie-laid."

"An' did mun laid ee into Hole?'' asks his wife in a somewhat sceptical
tone, and looking meaningly at the farmer's wife by her side.

"Hole? I ant a bin to Hole; I've a bin wanderin' and wanderin' 'bout
'pon the moor, all the aivlin.''

"Bless your life! " exclaims Dick the moor-man, then you've a mait wi'
et, sure nuff.'

"An' you've a bin out 'pon the moor all the time, hev ee," says his
wife. Well, I never."

"I've a bin pisgie-laid, as sure as I'm a zittin here," says the good
man, throwing himself into a corner of the " settle," and looking round
upon the company, "and a pooty dance I've had ov et, too."

''Well now,'' observes the grandfather "you may think zo, but I would'n
be too sure about et. I never knawed pisgies to he out 'pon the moor
such a night as this is."

This remark seems to comfort 'Liza, who had grown quite nervous again on
hearing the farmer affirm that he had been led astray by the pixy elves.
She has now put away her ironing, and is seated on the long form near
the end of the table.

"All I can tell, ee, uncle," says the cheery visitor in answer to the
grandfather's observation, " is this. I must either a bin pisgie-laid or
bewitched, vur I could'n vind the track mure'n nothin'.'

"Where did ee lose un? '' asks the master of the house.

"Way gwain down the hill to Wenaver \[c\] Brook. I took the short cut
straight to the crossin', but I never hit pon un. I got auver the brook,
though, an' went on up the hill, thinkin' I was gwain on right enough,
when all at once I vound myself home by Benjie \[d\] Tar. 'Twas mortal
dark, to be sure, but still I can't zee how I should a got out o' my way
like that. Well, I walked to where I was thinkin' the Hole road was, and
in less than no time I vound myself gwain down hill. That wud'n right, I
knawed, zo I turned and keep't on, and twud'n long avaur I heerd water,
a long way down belaw me. 'Where be I too? ' I thought, ' this wan't do,
Zo I stapped still to think. Well, I could zee nort, but I guessed I
must be right a-top of the staip, behind Benjie Tar, again. A few steps
more and I should a gone auver, but I turned, and zoon zeed the tar
close by me, and on I went wance more. Thinks I, 'when I raich
home--though I don't knaw when that'll be--there'll be Bobs-a-die wi'
mother-----'."

"I don't b'lieve you thought any sich thing,'' interrupts his dame.

"Well, I knawed you was expectin' me to mait ee, an I fancied you'd
wonder why I had'n din so. Well, you'd hardly b'leve et, I but I
actually come to Benjie Tar twice arter that, and vind the road I
could'n. At last, by turnin' my coat inside out, I throwed off they
pisgies, and vound the track. Then, thinks I, 'tis no use o' my gwain to
Hole now, for mother hev gone home for zartin', zo I com'd away heer,
and heer I be."

"If you'd a bin a maid," says the moor-man, " p'raps you'd a had mun
round ee, kissin' ov cc. They do that sometimes, don't um, 'Liza?"

"Here, Mawsey," cries out the farmer's son to one of his younger
brothers in the chimney corner, " rin out and fetch a yafful o' turve'
\[e\] It is evident that he considers the fire once more needs his
attention, for he kneels down and busies himself with breaking up a slab
of peat and placing the pieces upon the glowing heap on the hearth.

"An' you wndn' feared you'd be laid into any danger? " asks the moor-man
of the hero of the adventure.

"No, taniby! All I thought about was what missis would think," he
replies, with a sly wink at his questioner.

"You troubled a pooty lot 'bout that, I reckon," says his better-half,
in a tone that indicates her disbelief of the assertion.

'Tis surprisin' how they pisgies will laid a body, though," says the
moor-man.

"Aw, ees, when they'm 'bout," says the grandfather, "that's true enough.
And then they can change their-selves, too. Zometimes they be in wan
shape, and zometimes in another."

"I s'pose they be, uncle," remarks the stout farmer.

"To be sure. An' they'm dressed brave and vine, zometimes, all in
green,--though I've also heerd tell ov they who've a seed mun dressed
out in rags, an' often wi' nort on, at all. They can get about from
place to place, too, mortal quick, vur they've only got to wish where
they want to go too, and there they be. They like most, though, zome
quiet place, down by water, vur carrin' on their sports,--'tes thackey
spots they fancy."

"Zackly," acquiesces the moor-man.

"Zometimes they heer mun down wells," continues the grandfather "a
chatterin' and makin' a pooty hollabaloo. They've a got their own ways
'bout everything, an' us can't understand mun."

"No, us can't," observes the moor-man, with the air of a philosopher.

The conversation then turns upon matters connected with their
occupations, and the moor-man seems never tired of speaking of Farmer
Mann's "bootiful bullocks," which he had in his charge last summer, or
of "maister's" sheep, now pastured in the 'in-country," \[f\] and of the
colts which he" zeed up the new-take \[g\] this mornin'."

At length the stout farmer, of whose wanderings over the moor the pixies
have been accused of being the cause, rises to go.

"Come, mother," he says' "tis most time for us to be gwain home."

"An' I must zee 'bout movin', too," says the moor-man, getting up from
the "settle," and following the master of the house to the door, in
order to assist in fetching the dame's horse from the stable.

The animal is soon brought, and the good woman helped by her husband to
mount, while the farmer stands by with a lantern in his hand. The
farmer's wife, on the doorstep, is bidding the dame good-bye, when the
moor-man suddenly slips slily back into the kitchen, a sound, very like
the smack of a whip, having struck upon his ear, and aroused his
curosity. The two lads in the chimney corner have fallen asleep, and the
old grandfather dozes quietly in his chair; but where are the farmer's
son and 'Liza? The moor-man peeps behind the "settle."

"I knawed I was right," he exclaims, as the young couple come forward,
looking very much confused, "I knawed I was right when I said thee didn'
need no pisgies to do that for ee' 'Liza! Well, I wish ee good night,
both," and with this he once more makes for the door.

A few minutes later the kitchen is empty, the inmates have retired to
rest, and the only sounds heard are the chirp, chirp of tile little
cricket, and the slow ticking of time old-fashioned clock.
