Chapter I

The Moorland Haunts of the Pixies:  
Sheeps Tor: Huccaby Cleave

<span id="img_10"></span> ![](img/10.jpg)

 

AMONG the superstitions of bygone times which still linger in
Devonshire, the ideas regarding the pixies are undoubtedly the most
interesting and romantic. Although the faith of the peasantry in the
ability of these "little people" to exercise a control over their
domestic arrangements is less firm than of yore, yet a notion still
prevails that ill-luck will certainly overtake the hapless wight who is
so unfortunate as to offend any of these diminutive elves. While
instances are frequently related of help having been given to the farmer
by these little sprites at night, the peasant who has only "heerd tell"
of them, naturally looks upon them with some slight suspicion, and this
lack of ocular demonstration on the part of the pixies it is that has
somewhat shaken the faith of Hodge and Giles in their doings. However,
let them be out late at night and hear some unusual sound at a lonely
part of their road, or see, in the hollow below, the Will-o'-the-Wisp
hovering about, and straightway they will begin to fancy the "little
people" have something to do with it, and although they may he inclined
to combat the idea, yet they will not be able to quite rid themselves of
the impression that what they heard and saw was the pixies indulging in
their midnight revels.

But it is to Dartmoor. we must go if we would hear fully of the
fantastic tricks and antics of this elfin race, for there, and amid the
combes which run far up into its borders, we shall find many a nook
where they have often been observed dancing at night, according to old
Uncle So-and-so, and in many an ancient farm-house shall be told how the
-butter has been made, and the corn in the barn been threshed by these
industrious little goblins.

Not far from the point of confluence of the two branches of the Mew
rises "Sheepstor's dark-browed rock," and on the slope of the tor, on
the side on which the village lies, is a vast clatter of boulders. Amid
this is a narrow opening between two upright rocks, which will admit the
visitor, though not without a little difficulty, into a small grotto,
celebrated in local legend, and known as the Pixies' Cave. On entering
the cleft we shall find that the passage, which is only a few feet in
length, turns abruptly to the left, and we shall also have to descend a
little, as the floor of the cave is several feet lower than the rock at
the entrance. This turning leads immediately into the cave which we
shall find to be a small square apartment capable of containing several
persons, but scarcely high enough to permit us to stand upright. On our
left as we enter is a rude stone seat, and in the furthest corner a low
narrow passage, extending for some little distance, is discoverable.
According to a note in Polwhele's *Devon*, this cavern became the
retreat durng the Civil Wars of one of the Elford family, who here
successfully hid himself from Cromwell's soldiers, and it is related
that he beguiled the time by painting on the rocky walls of the cavern,
traces of the pictures remaining long afterwards, hut nothing of the
sort is discoverable now. Mrs. Bray in her romance of *Warleigh* has
introduced with good effect this story of the fugitive royalist, and
indeed it was this tradition, so she tells us in her Borders *of the
Tamar and the Tavy*, which first awakened a desire in her mind to search
out the legendary lore of the neighbourhood, and which she afterwards
presented to the public in so agreeable a form.

As its name indicates, the grotto is one of the haunts of the pixies,
and according to local tradition these little fairy elves have made it
their resort from time immemorial. Doubtless in days gone by the old
people of Sheepstor saw--or fancied they saw--the

"Litt'e pixy fair and slim  
Without a rag to cover him."

busy clambering over the rocks by moonlight as he issued forth from his
retreat to visit some farm-house to help forward the good yeoman's work,
or to wait until sunrise to pinch the lazy maid-servants should they
fail to leave their beds at the proper time.

But there is one thing which we must not forget ere we leave the cave.
Do not let us go thoughtlessly away without leaving an offering for the
pixies, or piskies, as the country people more frequently call them.
They are not extravagant in their expectations, so we shall not be taxed
very highly. A pin will suffice, or a piece of rag, provided it is
sufficiently large to make a garment for one of these little folks, for
though sometimes seen in a state of nudity, they would seem to be proud
of possessing a suit of clothes. Indeed a sort of weakness for finery
exists among them, and a piece of ribbon appears to be as highly prized
by them, as a gaudy coloured shawl or string of heads would be by an
African savage.

The cave is rather difficult to find, and one might pass and re-pass the
crevice which forms its opening, without ever dreaming that such a place
existed there, so narrow does the entrance look. The clatter is a
perfect wilderness of boulders, and stretches around to the eastern side
of the tor, where the rocks rise perpendicularly, forming a precipice of
great height.

As we stand at the entrance to the grotto we may look down upon the
little village of Sheepstor and its church with sturdy granite tower,
nestling in the sheltered combe, while the grey tor rises high behind
us, exposed to all the buffetings of the wild moorland storm.

The tradition connecting the cavern on Sheeps Tor with the Elford family
has, of course, rendered it more celebrated than it otherwise would have
become had it depended on the pixies alone for its; notoriety, for
though most people in this part of Devonshire have heard of the cave,
few beyond the borders of Dartmoor have any knowledge of a larger and
more striking retreat of these llittle people.''

This is known to the dwellers on the moor as the Piskies' Holt, and is
situated in Huccaby Cleave, not far from Dartmeet. \[a\]

The West Dart makes a sweep round the hill between Hexworthy Bridge and
the point: where it meets its sister stream as it comes rolling down by
the plantations of Brimpts, and after leaving Week Ford passes the
cleave. Among the tangled bushes and underwood growing here, may be seen
four rather large sycamore trees, at some distance from the left bank of
the river, and it is beneath these that we shall discover the Piskies'
Holt. \[b\] It is a long narrow passage formed by large slabs of granite
resting on two natural walls of the same. It is curved in form and
extends for a distance of thirty-seven feet. its width is about four
feet, and it is of sufficient height for a man to stand upright in it.
The entrance, which is but two-and-a-half feet in height, is at the
eastern cud, and at time other extremity is a small aperture through
which it is possible to climb out of te cave. The floor is thickly
covered with decayed leaves, blown in by the wind.

In summer time the knoll beneath which runs the bolt, is a most charming
spot. The sycamore trees cast a cool and refreshing shade around, and
the ferns with their bright green fronds, and the tall fox-gloves which
lift their heads amid them, cover the ground near time fairy haunt, and
force upon us the conviction that the pixies at all events have
exhibited a deal of taste in their choice of an abode. Below, the West
Dart hurries away to mingle its waters with time companion who never
deserts it, but flows onward with it to the ocean, forcing its way over
huge boulders, its banks overhung with foliage, and on the opposite
hill-side are numerous enclosures which the hand of industry has rescued
from the desert, with the brown moor stretching away beyond.

Truly it is a delightful spot, and as we throw ourselves back on the
soft moss with the bright sun-rays streaming through the leafy canopy
overhead, we can imagine that we are at the court of Oberon and Queen
Titania. Did we visit the haunt by moonlight, perchance we should see
the little elves coming stealthily forth from their retreat, and forming
a fairy ring, indulge in their merry gambols on the sward.

Oh, these be Fancy's revellers by night  
Stealthy companions of the downy moth--  
Diana's motes, that flit in her pale light.  
Shunners of sunbeams in diurnal sloth  
These be the feasters on night's silver cloth  
The gnat with shrilly trump is their convener.  
Forth from their flowery chambers, nothing loth,  
With lulling times to charm the air serener.  
Or dance upon the grass to make it greener. " \[c\]

Many are the tales related of the doings of the pixies in this romantic
neighbourhood, and in my note-book I have stored up more than one
curious story, as I have gathered them from the Dartmoor peasants, to
relate some of which shall presently be my pleasing task.

The two grottoes that I have noticed are the principal haunts of the
pixies of Dartmoor, but there is not a tor near any of the moorland
farms that has not been visited by them occasionally, and every
homestead has at some time or other been the scene of the pranks of
these merry elves. If we ask an old house-wife who and what the pixies
are, she will tell us they are the souls of unbaptized children, and if
we enquire as to their appearance, we shall be informed that they
sometimes present themselves to human vision under the semblance of a
small bundle of rags, but more frequently are seen in the form of little
beings dressed in fantastic garments.

We shall find that beyond an excessive fondness for leading travellers
astray, and for curiously riding on the Dartmoor colts much to the
annoyance of the farmers, they seldom interfere with, or seek to bring
trouble upon anyone, unless injury has been inflicted upon them. liven
the practice in which they indulge of misleading travellers, we are
told, may not be simply one of mischief, but may be for the purpose of
leading the wayfarer from their secret haunts when he is unconsciously
approaching too near diem, or may perhaps be intended as a punishment
for some slight shown to them. It is true that lazy servants, and greedy
and indolent masters suffer occasionally at their hands, but who can
find fault with this? As a rule these "little people" seem to desire to
do kind actions to the country folk, rather than cause them annoyance
and inconvenience.

If perchance one should happen to be "pixy-led," as it is termed, and
should find it impossible to discover the desired track, an infallible
remedy for this state of things is to divest oneself of some outer
garment, turn it inside out, and put it on again, when the charm will be
at once broken. Only a few years since an instance o this being tried
came tinder my notice, but although it may have prevented the pixies
from continuing their spell, it certainly did not have the effect of
enabling the wanderers to find their road, when they had been once
turned aside from it. Some young people set out from Hexworthy with The
intention of going to Princetown by way of Swincombe, and across Tor
Royal New-take. When they reached the latter enclosure, which is a very
extensive one, a Dartmoor mist utterly prevented them from finding their
way across it, and they wandered about for some time, totally unable to
discover the wall of the new-take, and so gain the gate. They concluded
they must be "pixy-led," and the remedy in question was called into
requisition. A short time after having done this they came upon an old
kistvaen, known to the moor people as the "Crock of Gold," and which
they had already stumbled upon several times in their wandering. This is
close beside the green path that leads across the new-take, but night
being far advanced and the mist being still very dense they determined
to wait until the morning broke, when their friends, who had made up a
search party, discovered them.

Sometimes these merry little elves have been seen dancing in a circle on
thc sides of the hills, as the peasant has made his way homeward after
night-fall; but as such sights have generally been witnessed when the
beholder has been returning from a merry-making, a sheep-shearing feast,
perhaps, or a Christmas revel, I am reluctantly obliged to confess that
I am of opinion that the appearance of these spirits must have had some
connection with the spirits of the hospitable farmer, and that a nodding
thistle, or a bunch of gorse, may have been, in the heated imagination
of the rustic, set down as a dancing elf.

Such tricks hath strong imagination;  
That if it would but apprehend some joy,  
It comprehends some bringer of that joy  
Or, in the night, imagining some fear,  
How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear!" \[d\]

These merry little folks though credited with many a frolicsome gambol,
are seemingly very shy of disporting themselves at the present day,
being much more retiring in their disposition than we are informed was
the case "years agone;" but their curious pranks still form a theme for
conversation when, the labours of the day being over, and darkness
covers the moor, the cottagers gather round to spend the evening hour by
the comfortable peat fire.

among rocks,--the retreating place of a fox or a badger.--a hold, as it
were. The ancient meaning of the word was a wood, or grove, and Risdon

Athelstane. where the word, is used. Athelstane king, grome of this
