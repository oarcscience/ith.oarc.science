### (2) KISSING THE BRIDE.

The York Missal and the Sarum Manual both enjoin the nuptial kiss, but
it should be given in church. It is expressly mentioned in the following
line from the old play of The Insatiate Countess by Marston:--

"The kisse thou gav'st me in the church here take."

In some places it is still customary for the men of the marriage party
to kiss the bride in church; although an increasing respect for the
altar prevents the event from taking place immediately the benediction
is pronounced, as was once the rule; if done at all, the kissing is half
furtively concluded in the vestry or in the home of the bride. Vaughan,
in his Golden Grove (1608), says that "among the Romans the future
couple sent certain pledges one to another which most commonly, they
themselves afterwards being present, would confirm with a religious
kisse." Kissing is a Caucasian habit; orientals being strangers to it.
Lombroso discovers its origin in maternal caresses from which it
developed into feelings of trust and reverence.
