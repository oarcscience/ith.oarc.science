### (19) SNEEZING.

The advance of modern physiology has all but killed the sneezing
superstition, at least in civilised countries. Among peoples who have
not emerged from savagery, or whose intellectual equipment, in spite of
contact with superior races, is still meagre in the extreme, sneezing is
an omen whose significance they dare not disallow. It might not be too
much to say that there are white races who look upon the sneeze of a
sick child as an omen. Even the Christian world at one time was a devout
supporter of the sneezing superstition. Probably there are people living
to-day who can remember the "God bless you," which was usually addressed
to a person after a sneeze. The origin of the saying is found by some
authorities in the fact that "violent sneezing was once an epidemic and
mortal distemper from whence the custom took its rise. In one of
Martial's epigrams we find the Romans had the same custom, and not
improbably derived from the same reason." But the real origin lies in
the doctrine of the soul as understood by primitive man. Some approach
to this fact is attained in the translation by Sir Henry Ellis of a
section from Garnier's History of France:--

"The year 750 is commonly reckoned the era of the custom of saying 'God
bless you' to one who happens to sneeze. It is said that, in the time of
the pontificate of St Gregory the Great, the air was filled with such a
deleterious influence that they who sneezed immediately expired. On this
the devout pontiff appointed a form of prayer, and a wish to be said to
persons sneezing for averting them from the fatal effects of this
malignancy. A fable contrived against all the rules of probability, it
being certain that this custom has from time immemorial subsisted in all
parts of the known world. According to mythology, the first sign of life
Prometheus's artificial man gave was by sternutation. This supposed
creator is said to have stolen a portion of the solar rays; and filling
with them a phial, which he had made on purpose, sealed it up
hermetically. He instantly flies back to his favourite automaton, and
opening the phial, held it close to the statue; the rays, still
retaining all their activity, insinuate themselves through the pores,
and set the fictitious man a-sneezing. Prometheus, transported with the
success of his machine, offers up a fervent prayer with wishes for the
preservation of so singular a being. His automaton observed him,
remembering his ejaculations, was very careful on the like occasions to
offer these wishes in behalf of his descendants, who perpetuated it from
father to son in all their colonies.

"The Rabbies, speaking of this custom, do likewise give it a very
ancient date. They say that, not long after the Creation, God made a
general decree that every man living should sneeze but once, and that at
the very instant of his sneezing his soul should depart without any
previous indisposition. Jacob by no means liked so precipitate a way of
leaving the world, as being desirous of settling his family affairs and
those of his conscience: he prostrated himself before the Lord, wrestled
a second time with him, and earnestly entreated the favour of being
excepted from the decree. His prayer was heard, and he sneezed without
dying. All the Princes of the universe, being acquainted with the fact,
unanimously ordered that, for the future, sneezing should be accompanied
with thanksgivings for the preservation, and wishes for the
prolongation, of life. We perceive, even in these fictions, the vestiges
of tradition and history, which place the epocha of this civility long
before that of Christianity. It was accounted very ancient even in the
time of Aristotle, who, in his 'Problems,' has endeavoured to account
for it, but knew nothing of its origin. According to him, the first men,
prepossessed with the highest ideas concerning the head, as the
principal seat of the soul, that intelligent substance governing and
animating the whole human system, carried their respect even to
sternutation, as the most manifest and most sensible operation of the
head. Hence those several forms of compliments used on similar occasions
amongst Greeks and Romans: Long may you live! May you enjoy health!
Jupiter preserve you!"

But the true story of the sneezing superstition is told by Professor E.
B. Tylor, who says:--

"In Asia and Europe the sneezing superstition extends through a wide
range of race, age, and country. Among the passages relating to it in
the classic ages of Greece and Rome, the following are some of the most
characteristic: the lucky sneeze of Telemachus in the Odyssey; the
soldier's sneeze and the shout of adoration to the god which rose along
the ranks, and which Xenophon appealed to us a favourable omen;
Aristotle's remark that people consider a sneeze as divine, but not a
cough; the Greek epigram on the man with the long nose who did not say
Zeu Soson when he sneezed, for the noise was too far off for him to
hear; Petronius Arbiter's mention of the custom of saying 'Salve' to one
who sneezed; and Pliny's question 'Cur sternutamentis salutamus?'
a-propos of which he remarks that even Tiberius Caesar, that saddest of
men, exacted this observance. Similar rites of sneezing have long been
observed in Eastern Asia. When a Hindu sneezes, bystanders say 'Live!'
and the sneezer replies, 'With you!' It is an ill omen to which among
other things the Thugs paid great regard on starting an expedition, and
which even compelled them to let the travellers with them escape." But
this does not show us the real origin of the sneezing superstition;
although it adequately shews the extent of its operations. Tylor traces
the first beginnings of the habit in the savage idea of souls. "As a
man's soul is considered to go in and out of his body, so it is with
other spirits, particularly such as enter into patients and possess them
or afflict them with disease. Among the less cultured races the
connection of this idea with sneezing is best shewn among the Zulus, a
people firmly persuaded that kindly or angry spirits of the dead hover
about them in dreams, enter into them and cause disease in them. When a
Zulu sneezes he will say, 'I am now blessed. The ldhlozi (ancestral
spirit) is with me; it has come to me. Let me hasten and praise it, for
it is it which causes me to sneeze.' So he praises the manes of his
family, asking for cattle, and wives and blessings."

Thus from the far past, as seen in the customs of uncivilised races in
the present, must we draw the solution of a curious superstition, one
which, better perhaps than any other that could be mentioned, is a good
illustration of the power of ignorance to create and foster a delusion.
Even the great Aristotle indulged in the problem as to "why sneezing
from noon to midnight was good, but from night to noon unlucky." If "the
master of those who know" could be puzzled by a physiological
simplicity, shall we be amazed at the extent of the sneezing
superstition throughout the long centuries of pagan and Christian
history?
