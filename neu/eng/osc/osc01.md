# PREFACE

THE following pages are based on Brand's Popular Antiquities, the
edition published in 1841, supplemented by the results of later
investigation. My aim has been to deal only with those superstitions and
customs which are operative at the present time; and, as far as is
possible, to trace these to their original sources. In some cases the
task is fairly easy, in others very difficult; whilst in a few instances
the "prime origin," to use the words of Brand, is absolutely
unattainable. Still, in these days of pageantry, when the British people
show some signs of periodically reviewing the picturesque life of bygone
times, it will be a source of satisfaction if in this book I succeed in
tracing, though it be for a century or two, the thoughts and habits
which were born in a remote past.
