### (16) THE OWL.

Bourne remarks that "if an owl, which is reckoned a most abominable and
unlucky bird, send forth its hoarse and dismal voice, it is an omen of
the approach of some terrible thing; that some dire calamity and some
great misfortune is near at hand." This omen occurs in Chaucer:

"The jelous Swan, ayenst hys deth that singeth,  
The Oule eke, that of deth the bode bringeth."  
Assembly of Foules.

It is thus mentioned by Spenser:

"This rueful Strich still wayting on the beere,  
The whistler shril, that whoso heares doth die."

It would be too much to say that these sentiments are still alive
to-day, but it is not too much to say that women and children listen to
the weird cries with something approaching apprehension. Why? Simply
because the note is dismal, and because it is heard in the night when
other sounds are still. And if such is the effect now, we need not be
surprised to learn it was the effect in more superstitious ages; ages
when men, too, were under the spell. An owl once strayed into the
Capitol at Rome, with the result that the city underwent a lustration.
Butler speaks of this incident in his Hudibras:--

"The Roman Senate, when within  
The city walls an Owl was seen,  
Did cause their clergy with lustrations  
(Our Synod calls humiliations)  
The round-fac'd prodigy t'avert  
From doing town and country hurt."

The Romans appear to have had most determined views on owls and their
significance. "Julius Obsequens (in his Book of Prodigies, c. 85) shews
that a little before the death of Commodus Antoninus, the Emperor, an
Owl was observed to sit upon the top of his chamber, both at Rome and at
Lanuvium. Xiphilinus, speaking of the prodigies that went before the
death of Augustus, says that the Owl sang upon the top of the Curia. He
shews, also, that the Actian War was presignified by the flying of Owls
into the Temple of Concord. In the year 1542, at Herbipolis, or
Wirtzburg, in Franconia, this unlucky bird, by his screeching songs,
affrighted the citizens a long time together, and immediately followed a
great plague, war, and other calamities. About twenty years ago, I did
observe that in the house where I lodged, an Owl, groaning in the
window, presaged the death of two eminent persons, who died there
shortly after."

The death of such convictions could not fail to be slow, but widening
knowledge has at last almost dispersed them, and nothing is left but the
weird screech itself.
