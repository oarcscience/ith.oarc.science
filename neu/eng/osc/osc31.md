### (29) YULE LOGS

There seem to be a hundred origins of the word Yule according to the
writers on popular antiquities. The most ingenious is that of Bryant,
who derives the Feast Juul or Yule from a Hebrew word--Lile, Night.
Lile, he adds, is formed from a verb signifying to howl, because at that
time, i.e. at night, the beasts of the forest go about howling for their
prey. "In the Northern counties, nothing is more common than to call
that melancholy barking dogs oft make in the night Yowling, and which
they think generally happens when some one is dying in the
neighbourhood."

Christmas Day, in the primitive Church, was always observed as the
Sabbath day, and like that, preceded by an Eve, or Vigil. Hence our
present Christmas Eve.

On the night of this eve our ancestors were wont to light up candles of
an uncommon size, called Christmas candles, and lay a log of wood upon
the fire, called a Yule-clog, or Christmas-block, to illuminate the
house, and, as it were, to turn night into day. This custom is in some
measure still kept in the North of England.

The following occurs in Herrick's Hesoerides:--

### CEREMONIES FOR CHRISTMASSE.

"Come bring with a noise,  
My merry, merrie boys,  
The Christmass Log to the firing:  
While my good Dame she  
Bids ye all be free,  
And drink to your heart's desiring.

"With the last year's Brand  
Light the new Block and,  
For good successe in his spending,  
On your psaltries play,  
That sweet luck may  
Come while the Log is teending.

"Drink now the strong beere,  
Cut the white loaf here,  
The while the meat is a-shredding  
For the rare mince-pie,  
And the plums stand by  
To fill the paste that's a-kneading."

Christmas, says Blount, was called the Feast of Lights in the Western or
Latin Church, because they used many lights or candles at the feast; or
rather because Christ, the light of all lights, that true light, then
came into the world. Hence the Christmas candle, and what was, perhaps,
only a succedaneum, the Yule-block, or clog, before candles were in
general use. Thus a large coal is often set apart at present, in the
North, for the same purpose, i.e. to make a great light on Yule or
Christmas Eve. Lights, indeed, seem to have been used upon all festive
occasions, e.g. our illuminations and fireworks, on the news of
victories.

In The Gentleman's Magazine for 1790 a writer traces the Yule log to the
Cyclops of Euripides. (See Act i, sc i).
