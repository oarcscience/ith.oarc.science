### (8) PICKING UP SIXPENCES AT SMITHFIELD.

On Good Fridays at St. Bartholomew's Church, Smithfield, there is a
quaint ceremony conducted on a flat tombstone in the churchyard. A
churchwarden places twenty-one new sixpences on the tombstone, and
twenty-one widows come forward one by one, kneel, and pick up the coins.
Afterwards each widow is presented with 2/6. The origin of this ceremony
is said to be unknown, although it seems hardly likely that money should
be paid out year by year without even a tradition as to its
commencement. The surmise that the person who lies buried beneath the
tombstone left money to be spent in this way--see Sir Benjamin Stone's
remarks in his Pictures of National Life and History--only makes the
absence of details all the more strange.
