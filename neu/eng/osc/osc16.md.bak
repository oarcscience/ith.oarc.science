### (13) FURRY DANCE--HELSTON.

On May 8th every year the inhabitants of Helston celebrate the return of
Spring by what is known as the "Furry Dance," to the accompaniment of a
quaint horn-pipe tune. A ballad is also sung, and the opening verse
is:--

Robin Hood and Little John.  
They both are gone to the fair, O,  
And me to the merry green wood,  
To see what they do there, O.  
And for to chase, O  
To chase the buck and doe,  
With Hal-and-Tow,  
Jolly rumble, O.

At dawn a band marches through the town, and soon the young people begin
to dance in the streets. The "Furry Dance" itself does not "happen"
until about 1 p.m. The band begins to play the horn-pipe tune, and the
couples trip to the nearest house, waltz through it, and out into the
next house, through that, and so on to the next. The band itself
actually goes through the houses. There were other ceremonies on Furry
Day in bygone years, but the dance alone now survives.

Writing in 1790 a correspondent of The Gentleman's Magazane says:--"At
Helstone, a genteel and populous borough town in Cornwall, it is
customary to dedicate the eighth of May to revelry (festive mirth, not
loose jollity). It is called the Furry Day, supposed Flora's Day; not, I
imagine, as many have thought, in remembrance of some festival
instituted in honour of that goddess, but rather from the garlands
commonly worn on that day. In the morning, very early, some troublesome
rogues go round the streets with drums, or other noisy instruments,
disturbing their sober neighbours; if they find any person at work, make
him ride on a pole, carried on men's shoulders, to the river, over which
he is to leap in a wide place, if he can; if he cannot, he must leap in,
for leap he must, or pay money. About 9 o'clock they appear before the
school, and demand a holiday for the Latin boys, which is invariably
granted; after which they collect money from house to house. About the
middle of the day they collect together, to dance hand-in-hand round the
streets, to the sound of the fiddle, playing a particular tune, which
they continue to do till it is dark. This they call a 'Faddy.' In the
afternoon the gentility go to some farm-house in the neighbourhood to
drink tea, syllabub, etc., and return in a Morris dance to the town,
where they form a Faddy, and dance through the streets till it is dark,
claiming a right of going through any person's house, in at one door and
out at the other. And here it formerly used to end, and the company of
all kinds to disperse quietly to their several habitations; but latterly
corruptions have in this, as in other matters, crept in by degrees. The
ladies, all elegantly dressed in white muslins, are now conducted by
their partners to the ball-room, where they continue their dance till
supper-time; after which they all faddy it out of the house, breaking
off by degrees to their respective houses. The mobility imitate their
superiors, and also adjourn to the several public-houses, where they
continue their dance till midnight. It is, upon the whole, a very
festive, jovial, and withal so sober, and, I believe, singular custom;
and any attempt to search out the original of it, inserted in one of
your future Magazines, will very much please and gratify DURGAN."

The "original" of it is still wanting--and likely to be. It is one of
those obscurities which must be sought, if sought at all, in the local
genius of the people.
