### (2) WITCHCRAFT.

It is no part of our present purpose to adjudicate on the rights and
wrongs of witchcraft--with which we associate wizardry--rather is it our
object to trace the fact of its existence, real or alleged, back to the
earliest records of history. We may, too, look at the few remaining
instances in modern times of what was once a great source of fear, evil,
and cruelty.

Chaldean magic is, so far as expert investigation can tell, the real
source of that witchcraft which for centuries disturbed the peace of
rural populations in Europe, and engaged the angry attentions of priest
and layman alike. It should not be presumed that the magic of any
nation, living or dead, is a thing to be laughed out of court; a sort of
jugglery that could be learned like the skill of the conqueror. It was
something more than that. True we cannot say exactly what it was, or is,
for the practices of modern savage tribes have an unknown element of
psychic power in them, a fact which is attested by reliable travellers
and authorities. Thus in the Malay Peninsula to-day there are black
magicians, and their doings are not at all relished by the white man
whose treatment of them may have been lacking in justice. So, in the
earliest ages, we find the same kind of arts practised, followed by the
same results, that is, if we can rely on the testimony of those who have
recorded them. In Egypt, in Persia, in Greece, in India, and the East
generally, there was a definite place assigned to magic; and magic,
generically, was the use of an unseen and powerful agency for the
purpose of creating confusion, bestowing evil, taking revenge, and doing
all the works of the old time "Devil." For this reason witchcraft and
black magic have a strong family relationship, and we can only conclude
that since the arts they used are in many cases identical, the later
cult was a direct descendant of the earlier. That a good deal was lost
in transit is natural, and this would account for the feebler displays
of "power" by women of the middle English period as contrasted with the
"success" of the witch of Endor. Slowly the belief in witches died a
natural death, until now, in the twentieth century, it is hardly
possible to find a single man or woman who does not think the whole
persecutions of the past were founded on ignorance, religious
intolerance, and political spite. The accepted explanation of such
phenomena as are considered genuine is that of hypnotism, especially in
the case of sympathetic witchcraft, where a witch makes an image of her
enemy and pierces it with pins, or melts it before the fire. But this
explanation hardly covers the details of the best authenticated reports,
and we have either to disbelieve in these reports or fall back upon
hypnotism and suggestion. Probably the wisest attitude is that of the
agnostic, who, not knowing the real facts, and being unable to get at
them, is in no hurry to propound a theory for uncertain phenomena. But
witchcraft and wizardry are not dead entirely. In a London journal,
dated January 9, 1909, I find the following narrative which, on enquiry,
proved to be a serious contribution from an English traveller. The evil
eye is said to have a dread terror for the more ignorant Erse
population, but the story here told is, as will be seen, on true
witchcraft lines. "Some months ago I was on a visit to some friends in
the south of Ireland, and one morning when seated at breakfast a servant
rushed into the room, screaming hysterically that the dairymaid has just
found pishogue upon the dairy floor. Pishogue is a white, yellowish
fungus made at the dead of night, after a solemn incantation of the
devil, according to a secret rite which has been handed down from
generation to generation. My host, a 'big' landlord, sprang to his feet
and, followed by his wife and myself, ran hastily out of the house into
the trim, cool dairy where, upon the posts of the door, I saw the daubs
of pishogue. My host knocked it off quickly with a stick, and then,
turning angrily to the weeping dairy maid told her it was nothing at
all. But the next minute he informed me under his breath that he might
expect bad luck with his dairy, as it was indeed the cursed pishogue.
That very evening when his twenty splendid milch cows were driven into
their stalls to be milked, a cry of consternation went up from the lips
of the milkers; they were absolutely dry; and for months they remained
so, while a tenant who lived close to the demesne, an absolutely
drunken, impecunious, rascal, was noticed to give up his weekly
attendance at Mass, in spite of which irreligious conduct his miserable
dairy stock suddenly took the appearance of healthy, well-fed cattle,
and every one knew he was the man who had put pishogue upon his master
and robbed him of his good. It is a well-known fact that a dairy woman
will go to churn as usual, when, to her terror, she will find pishogue
daubed upon it. Let her churn for hours, she will make no butter, The
usual remedy resorted to by terrified people is to get Mass said in
their homes, and the places, cattle, or crops blessed on which the curse
has fallen. But that often fails to bring back the good."

Now I cannot say this story, although told circumstantially, is
convincing. It is one of those cases which need to be seen, in every
stage of development, before one can believe. But it is interesting as a
twentieth century tale of wizards and witches, for the midnight rite is
conducted by a group of men and women crouching over a smouldering fire.
Here is the tale of an old-fashioned witch--of the white
variety--reported in the Diss Express of December 16, 1893:--

"The Suffolk Coroner (Mr Charton) on Tuesday held an inquest at the
Green Man Inn, Mendlesham, touching the death of a child, named Maggie
Alberta Wade, daughter of Henry Wade, an agricultural labourer. The
first witness called was the mother, Elizabeth Wade, who stated that
last Friday the deceased pulled a cup of boiling soup over herself and
was badly scalded. She did not send for a doctor, but at once sent for
an old woman living in the neighbourhood, whose name is Brundish, who,
according to witness, is possessed of supernatural powers in the cure of
burns and scalds. The old woman came at once, and said some strange
words over the child, and passed her hands across the injured parts.
Witness, under these circumstances, did not consider the attendance of a
medical man necessary, but notwithstanding the woman's incantation, the
child died in 40 hours. Witness persisted in expressing her belief in
the old woman's power, and said she really was a witch. The female
referred to declined to reveal the words spoken, as she said she would
lose her power. Other witnesses professed their faith in the professions
of the old woman. Eventually, after the Coroner had commented on the
superstition exhibited, medical evidence was given to the effect that
the child's life could not have been saved."

No action seems to have been taken against the witch in this case, but
in the case of malevolent witches the cruelty of the punishment was so
severe that we cannot wonder at the total disappearance of black
witchcraft in this country. In The Gentleman's Magazine for 1751 there
is the following entry:--At Tring, in Hertfordshire, one B----d----d, a
publican, giving out that he was bewitched by one Osborne and his wife,
harmless people above 70, had it cried at several market-towns that they
were to be tried by ducking this day, which occasioned a vast concourse.
The parish officers having removed the old couple from the workhouse
into the church for security, the mob, missing them, broke the workhouse
windows, pulled down the pales, and demolished part of the house; and,
seizing the Governor, threatened to drown him and fire the town, having
straw in their hands for the purpose. The poor wretches were at length,
for public safety, delivered up, stripped stark naked by the mob, their
thumbs tied to their toes, then dragged two miles, and thrown into a
muddy stream; after much ducking and ill-usage, the old woman was thrown
quite naked on the bank, almost choked with mud, and expired in a few
minutes, being kicked and beat with sticks, even after she was dead; and
the man lies dangerously ill of his bruises. To add to the barbarity,
they put the dead witch (as they called her) in bed with her husband,
and tied them together. The Coroner's inquest have since brought in
their verdict, wilful murder, against Thomas Mason, Wm. Myatt, Rich.
Grice, Rich. Wadley, James Proudham, John Sprouting, John May, Adam
Curling, Francis Meadows, and twenty others, names unknown. The poor man
is likewise dead of the cruel treatment he received."

Whenever the modern palmist or fortune-teller comes into contact with
the police, the greatest punishment consists of a heavy fine--but in the
olden times the magician, wizard, or witch was open to the fury of the
mob, as is seen in the case of Tring. Lord Bacon's quaint philosophising
as to the origin of witchcraft wonders is worth reproducing:--"Men may
not too rashly believe the confession of Witches, nor yet the evidence
against them: for the Witches themselves are imaginative, and believe
oftentimes they do that which they do not; and people are credulous in
that point, and ready to impute accidents and natural operations to
Witchcraft. It is worthy the observing, that, both in ancient and late
times (as in the Thessalian witches, and the meetings of Witches that
have been recorded by so many late confessions), the great wonders which
they tell, of carrying in the air, transforming themselves into other
bodies, etc., are still reported to be wrought, not by incantations or
ceremonies, but by ointments and anointing themselves all over. This may
justly move a man to think that these fables are the effects of
imagination; for it is certain that ointments do all (if they be laid on
anything thick), by stopping of the pores, shut in the vapours, and send
them to the head extremely."

Reviewing the whole matter, one may conclude that whatever indisputable
wonders exist in the history of witchcraft were due to black magic,
which is the use of an unknown mental force for the accomplishment of an
evil end; or, if we are unable to accept that hypothesis, we are thrown
back on a species of hypnotism. In either case we cannot flatter
ourselves on the extent of our knowledge, or the authenticity of our
"facts."
