### (17) ASCENSION DAY--"BEATING THE BOUNDS."

The visitor to London, be he a Britisher or a foreigner, cannot but be
struck by the manner in which the City Corporation keeps up some of the
old customs, particularly those which are carried out under the eyes of
the public. Among them is the practice of "beating the bounds." Even the
callous man of the City will pause in, say Coleman Street, as he sees a
uniformed servant of the Corporation stop at a certain point, utter a
few words from a document, and then wait a moment as two or three boys
with bunches of long, thin rods belabour the walls or doorways to their
own satisfaction and the amusement of the crowd? What does it all mean?

It was a general custom formerly (says Bourne), and is still observed in
some country parishes, to go round the bounds and limits of the parish
on one of the three days before Holy Thursday, or the Feast of our
Lord's Ascension, when the minister, accompanied by his churchwardens
and parishioners, were wont to deprecate the vengeance of God, beg a
blessing on the fruits of the earth, and preserve the rights and
properties of the parish.

He cites Spelman as deriving this custom from the times of the Heathens,
and that it is an imitation of the Feast called Terminalia, which was
dedicated to the god Terminus, whom they considered as the guardian of
fields and landmarks, and the keeper up of friendship and peace among
men. The primitive custom used by Christians on this occasion was for
the people to accompany the bishop or some of the clergy into the
fields, where Litanies were made, and the mercy of God implored, that He
would avert the evils of plague and pestilence, that He would send them
good and seasonable weather, and give them in due season the fruits of
the earth.

In Herbert's Country Parson (1652), we are told that "the Country Parson
is a lover of old customs, if they be good and harmlesse. Particularly,
he loves Procession, and maintains it, because there are contained
therein four manifest advantages. First, a blessing of God for the
fruits of the field. 2. Justice in the preservation of bounds. 3.
Charitie in loving, walking, and neighbourly accompanying one another,
with reconciling of differences at that time, if there be any. 4.
Mercie, in relieving the poor by a liberal distribution and largess,
which at that time is or ought to be used. Wherefore he exacts of all to
be present at the Perambulation, and those that withdraw and sever
themselves from it he mislikes, and reproves as uncharitable and
unneighbourly; and, if they will not reforme, presents them."

This gives a fair notion of the custom in the middle of the seventeenth
century. Sir John Hawkins (1776) says in his History of Music, "it is
the custom of the inhabitants of parishes, with their officers, to
perambulate in order to perpetuate the memory of their boundaries, and
to impress the remembrance thereof in the minds of young persons,
especially boys; to invite boys, therefore, to attend to this business,
some little gratuities were found necessary; accordingly it was the
custom, at the commencement of the procession, to distribute to each a
willow-wand, and at the end thereof a handful of points, which were
looked on by them as honorary rewards long after they ceased to be
useful, and were called Tags."

In the Churchwardens' Accounts of St. Mary-at-Hill in the City of
London, 1682, are the following entries:--

|                                |     |     |     |
|--------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
|                                | £   | s\. | d\. |
| For fruit on Perambulation Day | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| For points for two yeres - -   | 2   | 10  | 0   |

 

The following extracts are from the Churchwardens' Books of Chelsea:--

|                                                        |     |     |     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
|                                                        | £   | s\. | d\. |
| "1679. Spent at the Perambulation Dinner - - - - - - - | 3   | 10  | 0   |
| Given to the boys that were whipt -                    | 0   | 4   | 0   |
| Paid for poynts for the boys - -                       | 0   | 2   | 0   |

 

(Lysons's Environs of London, vol. ii. p. 126.)

The second of these entries alludes to another expedient for impressing
the recollection of particular boundaries on the minds of some of the
young people.

"Bumping persons to make them remember the parish boundaries has been
kept up even to this time (1830). See a trial on the occasion, where an
angler was bumped by the parishioners of Walthamstow parish, reported in
the Observer Newspaper of January 10th, 1830. He was found angling in
the Lea, and it was supposed that bumping a stranger might probably
produce an independent witness of parish boundary. He obtained £50
damages."

The encroaching of boundaries is now an item against which it is
superfluous to obtain protection, and all that remains of a once
important custom is the quaint journey round the City of London
previously referred to, and the repetition of similar functions in
Linlithgow and Selkirk, also the Tower of London.
