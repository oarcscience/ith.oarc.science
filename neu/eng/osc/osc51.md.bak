### (10) AMULETS, GEMS, CHARMS, TALISMANS, MASCOTS.

An amulet (from the Arab word hamala=to carry) is anything hung round
the neck, placed like a bracelet on the wrist, or otherwise attached to
the person, as an imagined preservative against sickness or other evils;
a charm is exactly the same thing, the only difference being that the
word itself contains the notion of some human action imparting to the
article a certain power for good--hence the expression, "a charmed
life;" a gem is simply the general name of a precious stone, used in
this association because of alleged occult powers; a talisman is a
special kind of charm on which is cut or engraved a magical figure, worn
to avoid disaster to the wearer. A mascot is identical with a talisman,
except that the design need not be there. It will thus be seen that
there is no essential difference between these articles: they are all
worn to ward off diseases and bad luck.

Since the practice of wearing such protective devices is a very ancient
one, and one that still obtains, with perhaps a tendency to increase, I
propose to enquire into the habits of the past and of the present, and
into the underlying reasons which are given by wearers for the use of
charms and amulets. For it is not without significance that a West End
lady should appear to have the same belief in their efficacy as a
Priestess of Amen Ra, on whose remains are found evidences of careful
protections against evil. A superstition that has vitality after the
lapse of many thousands of years is worth more than ordinary attention.

Mr G. H. Bratley, the author of The Power of Gems and Charms, devotes no
less than 94 pages to "Historical Charms," having collected together a
great variety of cases to show the place which such objects have had in
history. One must admit that certain articles have attained historic
importance, mainly the articles which are said to exercise a malevolent
influence, like the famous Spanish opal or the mummy case in the British
Museum. What is lacking in the book under notice is attestation. For
instance, no authority is given for the following story:--"The Czar of
Russia is said to have great confidence in relics. He wears a ring in
which is embedded a piece of the true Cross, and it is said to have the
virtue of shielding its wearer from any physical danger. It was
originally one of the treasures of the Vatican, and was presented to an
ancestor of the Czar for diplomatic reasons. The value which its owner
sets upon the ring is shewn by the fact that he will never, if possible,
move any distance without it. Some years ago he was travelling from St
Petersburg to Moscow, when he suddenly discovered he had forgotten the
ring. The train was stopped immediately, and a special messenger sent
back in an express for it; nor would the Czar allow the train to move
until eight hours afterwards, when the messenger returned with the ring.
It is said that when his ill-fated grandfather was so cruelly
assassinated, he had left the ring behind him." Very interesting as a
story, but how do we know it is true? How do we know a good many other
amulet stories are true? We don't know; we only know there is a
considerable amount of literature to prove that charms and amulets have
been worn from time immemorial. That they are still worn, a little
shyly, a little half ashamedly, at least by Anglo-Saxons, is quite true.
The man and woman from the West End will wear their charms secretly as
they listen to the turns on the music-hall stage; but the Asiatic
wrestler, who has discarded most of his clothing, still wears his
talisman round his neck-boldly, even proudly. He has a full-hearted
belief in its efficacy in spite of an occasional defeat; the Anglo-Saxon
is not so sure, but with commercial instinct rather than religious
feeling, he wants to get the benefit if there is one. The psychological
attitude is well stated by a writer in The Referee, quoted by Mr
Bratley. "The belief in mascottes or talismans is very popular. Charms,
in the form of horse-shoes, pigs, four-leaved clover, and countless
other fancies, are very general, and at present very fashionable. I have
worn a lucky bean for seven years, and never lost it. I should very much
dislike to part with it, and have a sort of half belief in its bringing
me luck, or at least keeping off ill-luck." Exactly. A half-belief: no
more than that. The little pig dangling from a lady's bracelet is there
because of a hope that it will bring good things. Ask her for the
underlying science and she will only smile. "You do not understand." We
are not dealing with matters of common-sense, but with intuition. We are
following instinct rather than logic. Yes, we are, when we wear trinkets
and do not know why, except that others have worn them thousands of
years ago and allege their potent influence for good. Is not the secret
of their power in the fact that they are a visible emblem of defence?
Take a Turkish wrestler who wears his amulet round his neck. To be
without it would mean distress of mind--a real state of fear; to have it
is to bring out the best of his powers. And yet his opponent, utterly
destitute of a charm or of a belief in them, will probably beat him in
the struggle. Belief in the charm will not therefore be destroyed; the
cause of the failure will be looked for elsewhere.

The popularity of talismans, charms, amulets, and the whole tribe of
"lucky " gems, is best explained by the fact that mankind is fond of
decorative effect. We may laugh at the naked savage, who will strut up
and down the deck of a trading steamer at Lorenzo Marques, on which he
is a visitor for a quarter of an hour, dressed in a pair of spats and an
old silk hat--not a stitch of anything else--but there is the same
passion in more civilised countries. We express that passion with more
artistic restraint and better taste, but with women especially the
so-called belief in the occult influence of charms is secondary to the
love of gold and silver trinkets by way of adornment. It would not be
true to say that the essential superstition is absent; there can be no
doubt it would live even though the trinket were ugly and objectionable.
What we mean is that the decorative feature of charms comes first,
because it addresses itself to the eye; the appeal to fear and
imagination comes later. Besides which, the curious details of how
precious stones may be worn to evolve lucky events are worthy of an
expert advertising agent who wanted to bring the best results for his
clients--the goldsmiths and the jewellers. That some stones may be worn
by everybody with advantage is a judicious statement, especially as
those stones are diamonds, turquoises, and emeralds; but there is a
difference of opinion as to what stones "govern" the month of the year.
The usual scheme is as follows:--

|       |     |             |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Jan.  | =   | Garnet.     |
| Feb.  | =   | Amethyst.   |
| Mar.  | =   | Bloodstone. |
| April | =   | Diamond.    |
| May   | =   | Emerald.    |
| June  | =   | Agate.      |
| July  | =   | Ruby.       |
| Aug.  | =   | Sardonyx.   |
| Sep.  | =   | Sapphire.   |
| Oct.  | =   | Opal.       |
| Nov.  | =   | Topaz.      |
| Dec.  | =   | Turquoise.  |

 

But Mr H. Stanley Redgrove, B.Sc., in an article in The Occult Review on
"The Belief in Talismans," has a different arrangement, which,
apparently, possesses antique authority at least equal to those one
finds in such books as Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, or an
Occult Encyclopaedia. Probably an acute astrologer would object to all
the lists because they did not deal with "cusps." However, on the
following page will be found an outline of Mr Redgrove's plan:--

|                           |     |           |     |                 |
|---------------------------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| Aries, the Ram            | =   | April     | =   | Amethyst        |
| Taurus, the Bull          | =   | May       | =   | Agate           |
| Gemini, the Twins         | =   | June      | =   | Beryl           |
| Cancer, the Crab          | =   | July      | =   | Emerald         |
| Leo, the Lion             | =   | August    | =   | Ruby            |
| Virgo, the Virgin         | =   | September | =   | Jasper          |
| Libra, the Balance        | =   | October   | =   | Diamond         |
| Scorpio, the Scorpion     | =   | November  | =   | Topaz           |
| Sagittarius, the Archer   | =   | December  | =   | Carbuncle       |
| Capricorn, the Goat       | =   | January   | =   | Onyx Chalcedony |
| Aquarius, the Waterbearer | =   | February  | =   | Sapphire        |
| Pisces, the Fishes        | =   | March     | =   | Chrysolite      |

 

Mr Bratley appears to have made a compromise, for his list joins up half
months in the following manner:--

Duration of Size and Sun's period therein.

|              |     |              |            |
|--------------|-----|--------------|------------|
| January 21   | to  | February 18  | Garnet     |
| February 19  | to  | March 20     | Amethyst   |
| March 21     | to  | April 20     | Bloodstone |
| April 21     | to  | May 21       | Sapphire   |
| May 22       | to  | June 21      | Emerald    |
| June 22      | to  | July 23      | Agate      |
| July 24      | to  | August 23    | Ruby       |
| August 24    | to  | September 23 | Sardonyx   |
| September 24 | to  | October 23   | Chrysolite |
| October 24   | to  | November 22  | Opal       |
| November 23  | to  | December 22  | Topaz      |
| December 23  | to  | January 20   | Turquoise  |

 

Now, what is a woman to do who wishes to buy a ring with the right
birth-stone in it? She was born on July 2nd, 1890. Has she to follow the
first list? or the second? or the third? Who made these lists, and on
what science are they founded? All Mr Bratley can say is they are
formulated "according to the laws of judicial astrology." Is that all?
If it is, then we may be sure a well educated girl, who has gone through
some science and logic, will buy the ring for its beauty and intrinsic
value first; the superstitious element only provides her with material
for Society small talk. Authors may fling quotations at us from
Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Madame Blavatsky, but we need better
evidence than those people can furnish before we can accept the occult
power of gems. Mr Stanley Redgrove is of opinion that the power is not
in the charm, but in the belief of the wearer of the charm. It is the
power of the idea, although there is some evidence which suggests the
possibility of imparting certain mental qualities to an object. This
idea is all-sufficient, and an instance is quoted from an eminent
anthropologist--Dr. Haddon, see his Magic and Fetishism--about a Congo
negro, "who, being on a journey, lodged at a friend's house; the latter
got a wild hen for his breakfast, and the young man asked if it were a
wild hen? His host answered 'No.' Then he fell on heartily, and
afterwards proceeded on his journey. After four years these two met
together again, and his old friend asked him 'if he would eat a wild
hen,' to which he answered that it was taboo to him. Hereat the host
began immediately to laugh, inquiring of him, 'What made him refuse it
now, when he had eaten one at his table four years ago?' At the hearing
of this the negro immediately fell a-trembling, and suffered himself to
be so far possessed with the effects of imagination that he died in less
than twenty-four hours after."

Mr Redgrove thus concludes:--"We think, however, that the hidden truth
underlying the mass of superstitious nonsense connected with the subject
may be formulated thus:--the power of the talisman is the power of the
mind (or 'imagination') brought into activity by a suitable symbol.
