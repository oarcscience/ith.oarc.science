### (15) THIRTEEN AT TABLE.

If you care to take the trouble, you can work up a really awe-inspiring
amount of evidence to show that it is unlucky to sit thirteen at table;
and when the daring of Matthew Arnold in defying the superstition is
told in all its solemnity--he died within a year after the event--even
solid people shudder and begin to think "there is something in it."
Quite sensible women shrink in horror from a thirteen table, and imagine
the addition of a fourteenth person will break the evil spell, rendering
it inoperative. Of course the origin of the superstition is the Last
Supper, where thirteen were present; and the tragedies subsequent to
that meal are supposed to be repeated every time its number is enacted.
What a frightful slaughter would have marked the course of civilisation
had this been true! But Quetelet, in his Theory of Probabilities has,
one would have thought, smashed the idea beyond hope of revival. He
says:--"There is a prejudice existing generally on the pretended danger
of being the thirteenth at table. If the probability be required that
out of thirteen persons of different ages, one of them, at least, shall
die within a year, it will be found that the chances are about one to
one that one death at least will occur. This calculation by means of a
false interpretation has given rise to the prejudice, no less
ridiculous, that the danger will be avoided by inviting a greater number
of guests which can only have the effect of augmenting the probability
of the event so much apprehended." This is sound logic; so very
different from the blind reasoning of fanciful people who think that in
some occult manner a tragedy of the past will be repeated, if the same
number of people congregate together for the evening meal. The
superstition of thirteen at table is one of the most pitiful exhibitions
of mental weakness that has ever marked human thought. "Thirteen Clubs,"
composed of men and women determined to defy the superstition, may
justify themselves as social diversions, but as serious attempts at what
is called disproof, they are as futile as might be expected. Below I
give an extract from a London newspaper:--

"NEW YORK, Jan. 16.

"Superstition was flouted and invited to do its worst by all manner of
taunts levelled against the fearsome number thirteen at a banquet given
in New York last night by the members of the Thirteen Club.

"The club contains many more than thirteen members, but the diners sat
at tables thirteen to each. Before each plate a red candle burned in a
death's head holder, and the member whose candle went out first was
supposed to receive it as a sign. As soon as the company was seated a
new mirror was broken.

"The ices were served in the form of a skull reposing in a coffin. The
toastmaster used a forearm bone to rap for order. At intervals the
diners counted up to thirteen as a chant, the number thirteen being
hailed with cheers.

"At the close of the banquet the waiters filed into the room to the
music of a funeral march, each waiter bearing aloft a chocolate cake
with thirteen candles burning on it and a white skull and crossbones in
the centre.

"Insulted fate had revenge on the diners at one of the tables. At the
head of each table an open umbrella was placed to flaunt the rain
superstition. A waiter bearing a well-filled soup tureen caught the tail
of his coat in one of the umbrellas, and there was a shower of hot soup
over some of the jesters."

Yes, superstition was flouted, and so was intelligence.
