### (8) SELLING WIVES.

Within the last twenty years there have been at least a dozen cases
reported in the press of men in a low station in life who have sold
their wives, under the impression they could legally do so if all
parties were willing. One husband parted with his spouse for eighteen
pence and a glass of beer. He was evidently in need of a new system of
values, as well as some elementary instruction on the marriage law. But
Brand, writing in 1808, remarks:--"A remarkable superstition still
prevails among the lowest of our vulgar, that a man may lawfully sell
his wife to another, provided he deliver her over with a halter about
her neck. It is painful to observe that instances of this occur
frequently in our newspapers."

In modern transfers, the scene being the bar of a public-house, the
halter is missing, and a few coins take its place. But the origin of the
custom can only have originated in methods of marriage without the
sanction of priest or civil ceremony; the result being that, as the man
does the marrying himself, he concludes he is the sole contracting
party, able at will to dispose of his wife as he thinks fit.
