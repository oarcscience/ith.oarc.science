### (21) KNIFE SUPERSTITIONS.

When little Teddy is being trained in table manners, he is told it is
improper to place his knife and fork crosswise after the meal is
finished; he must place them side by side. Few people seem to think
there is anything behind this item of etiquette; they imagine it is
socially right because the crosswise position is aesthetically wrong; it
looks ugly.

Again, if a friend makes you a present of a knife, he invariably asks
you for a halfpenny, because it is accounted unlucky to give a knife to
a friend; it is apt to symbolise the cutting asunder of the bond of
union. Gay says:--

"But woe is me! such presents luckless prove,  
For knives, they tell me, always sever love."

The ritual of a past age was not wholly religious; it was to some extent
secular, and the symbols of things purely human. Hence to cross your
knife and fork at table is, according to Melton's Astrologaster, to
invite crosses and misfortune, from which we may presume that the mere
mechanical position of the cutlery was either suggestive of Calvary, or
symbolised troubles and crosses to come. How fervently did our
forefathers seek for types of the divine in the human, and of the moral
in the material!
