### (22) SHARKS FOLLOWING SHIPS A SIGN OF DEATH.

It is an old but still operative superstition among seafaring men, or,
shall I say, certain portions of them, that when a shark (or sharks)
persistently follows a vessel, it is a sign that someone on board is
going to die. The alleged reason is that the shark can "scent" death.
The biography of the Rev. Bryan Roe, a West African missionary, contains
the following narrative, which, when rid of the humorous exaggerations
of the sailor, may be said to contain his point of view:--"Two or three
sharks, it may be, are following in the vessel's wake, attracted, it
would seem, by the fact that there is a sick man lying on board; for the
old, weather-beaten, quarter-master confidentially informs the clerical
passenger (Mr Roe) that he will soon have a burial job on hand. The
quarter-master is always an authority on the subject of sharks. 'Them
there sharks,' he explains, 'have more sense in them than most
Christchuns. They knows wot's wot, I can tell yer; doctors ain't in it
with sharks. I've heard sharks larf when the doctor has told a sick man
he was convalescent--larf, sir, outright, 'cos they knew what a blessed
mistake he was making. They are following up the scent of a man on board
now that's going to die, and they'll not leave us until such times be as
they get him.'"

Procter's Return of the Admiral is a good setting of the shark
superstition:--

"How gallantly, how merrily  
We ride along the sea.  
The morning is all sunshine,  
The wind is blowing free,  
The billows are all sparkling  
And bounding in the light."

But

"In our wake like any servant  
Follows ever the bold shark."

Then the admiral of the fleet who

"Grew paler,  
And paler, as we flew,  
Spied the creature  
That kept following in our lee."

He seemed to be aware of the direful augury, for

"He shook--'twas but an instant  
For speedily the pride  
Ran crimson to his heart,  
Till all chances he defied."

But the admiral's defiance was in vain, for

"That night a hurried whisper  
Fell on us where we lay,  
And we knew our fine old admiral  
Was changing into clay.  
And we heard the wash of waters,  
Though nothing could we see,  
And a whistle and a plunge  
Among the billows in our lea;  
Till dawn we watched the body  
In its dead and ghastly sleep  
And next evening, at sunset,  
It was lung into the deep.  
And never from that moment,  
Save one shudder through the sea,  
Saw we or heard the shark  
That had followed in our lee."

Mr Frank Gibson, to whose very interesting Superstitions about Animals I
am indebted for the details of this subject, says that the superstition,
so far as he knows, has no foundation in fact. Sharks follow in the wake
of vessels for the same reason that all fish do, solely for the scraps
of meat and other leavings that are thrown overboard. "On a voyage to
South Africa, I noticed," remarks Mr Gibson, "when nearing the Equator,
that a very large, sinister looking shark kept up with the vessel for
many miles, but the passage concluded under the most favourable and
happy circumstances; no one died, and very few were even sea-sick.
Curiously enough, however, when I returned to England on a large liner,
fitted up as a hospital ship with accommodation for more than a thousand
invalids, we never sighted a shark from Capetown to Southampton, though
there were many cases of sickness on board, and one of the passengers
was buried at sea."

Truly this ought to have been a favoured vessel, but it seems to have
escaped sharkly attentions. An isolated instance, however, will not
extinguish the belief of a superstitious sailor, and we have still to
answer the question as to how the idea arose. Probably it belongs to
that group of beliefs which rest on the alleged powers of all kinds of
animals, crediting them with a prescience in some respects superhuman.
Thus the vulture is said, with some show of evidence, to know when death
is likely to overtake the desert traveller; the cattle on the prairie
"scent" the storm long before the cowboy knows it is coming; the howling
dog presages death, and the attendant shark is credited with knowing
more than the M.D. In the days of sailing vessels and slow voyages, the
mariner was more superstitious than he is to-day, because he was more at
the mercy of wind and weather--and he had funerals at sea often enough
to support, if not originate, the superstition of the shark. The modern
liner, with more people aboard and more chances of death, harbours no
belief in the supernatural knowledge of fish, great or small; so many
vessels are passing too and fro that the shark has his pick of them, and
need not follow one for days together. But in past centuries he had no
such luck; when he found a sailing ship he stuck to it in the hope of
finding a meal, not of human flesh, but of anything he could get hold
of. And so many sharks followed so many vessels in the course of years,
that there was ample room for the evolution of a superstition to the
effect that a persistent shark could scent death on board.
