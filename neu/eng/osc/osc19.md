### (16) GARLAND DAY AT ABBOTSBURY.

Do we offer floral tributes to Neptune in England to-day? Yes, at
Abbotsbury on the 13th May every year the children go round the village
with large garlands, asking for gifts from the inhabitants. When the
round has been completed, a start is made for the beach, the flowers are
placed in boats, and put out to sea--not for Neptune to do as he likes
with--for they are brought back again, taken to the church, where a
service is gone through. Here then is an excellent instance of a
Christianised pagan superstition, for the floral tributes, if Neptune is
to be worshipped, should be committed to the waves. The idea was to
propitiate the god and bring luck in fishing. In all probability the
custom will linger for some years to come, but it is already robbed of
its original significance, and shows some signs of decay in consequence.
Maybe some modern pagan, interested in old customs, will induce the
inhabitants to return to the old rite of trusting the floral gifts to
Father Neptune.
