# CHAPTER III: THE STORY OF CONSTANTINE AND ELENE

### The Greatness of Constantine Provokes Attack

IN the year 312, the sixth year after Constantine had become emperor,
the Roman Empire had increased on every hand, for Constantine was a
mighty leader in war, a gracious and friendly lord in peace; he was a
true king and ruler, a protector of all men. So mightily did he prosper
that his enemies assembled great armies against him, and a confederation
to overthrow him was made by the terrible Huns, the famous Goths, the
brave Franks, and the warlike Huns. This powerful confederation sent
against Constantine an overwhelming army of Huns, whose numbers seemed
to be countless, and yet the Hunnish leaders feared, when they knew that
the emperor himself led the small Roman host.

### The Eve of the Battle

The night before the battle Constantine lay sadly in the midst of his
army, watching the stars, and dreading the result of the next day's
conflict; for his warriors were few compared with the Hunnish multitude,
and even Roman discipline and devotion might not win the day against the
mad fury of the barbarous Huns. At last, wearied out, the emperor slept,
and a vision came to him in his sleep. He seemed to see, standing by
him, a beautiful shining form, a man more glorious than the sons of men,
who, as Constantine sprang up ready helmed for war, addressed him by
name. The darkness of night fled before the heavenly light that shone
from the angel, and the messenger said:

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

"O Constantinus, the Ruler of Angels,  
The Lord of all glory, the Master of heaven's hosts,  
Claims from thee homage. Be not thou affrighted,  
Though armies of aliens array them for battle,  
Though terrible warriors threaten fierce conflict.  
Look thou to the sky, to the throne of His glory;  
There seest thou surely the symbol of conquest."  
                                                  *Elene*.

### Vision of the Cross

Constantine looked up as the angel bade him, and saw, hovering in the
air, a cross, splendid, glorious, adorned with gems and shining with
heavenly light. On its wood letters were engraved, gleaming with
unearthly radiance:

"With this shalt thou conquer the foe in the conflict,  
And with it shalt hurl back the host of the heathen."  
                                                 *Elene*.

### Constantine is Cheered

Constantine read these words with awe and gladness, for indeed he knew
not what deity had thus favoured him, but he would not reject the help
of the Unknown God; so he bowed his head in reverence, and when he
looked again the cross and the angel had disappeared, and around him as
he woke was the greyness of the rising dawn. The emperor summoned to his
tent two soldiers from the troops, and bade them make a cross of wood to
bear before the army. This they did, greatly marvelling, and Constantine
called a standard-bearer, to whom he gave charge to bear forward the
Standard of the Cross where the danger was greatest and the battle most
fierce.

### The Morning of Battle

When the day broke, and the two armies could see each other, both hosts
arrayed themselves for battle,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

in serried ranks of armed warriors, shouting their war-cries.

"Loud sang the trumpets to stern-minded foemen:  
The dewy-winged eagle watched them march onward,  
The horny-billed raven rejoiced in the battle-play,  
The sly wolf, the forest-thief, soon saw his heart's desire  
As the fierce warriors rushed at each other.  
Great was the shield-breaking, loud was the clamour,  
Hard were the hand-blows, and dire was the downfall,  
When first the heroes felt the keen arrow-shower.  
Soon did the Roman host fall on the death-doomed Huns,  
Thrust forth their deadly spears over the yellow shields,  
Broke with their battle-glaives breasts of the foemen."  
                                                          *Elene*.

### The Cross is Raised

Then, when the battle was at its height, and the Romans knew not whether
they would conquer or die fighting to the last, the standard-bearer
raised the Cross, the token of promised victory, before all the host,
and sang the chant of triumph. Onward he marched, and the Roman host
followed him, pressing on resistless as the surging waves. The Huns,
bewildered by the strange rally, and dreading the mysterious sign of
some mighty god, rolled back, at first slowly, and then more and more
quickly, till sullen retreat became panic rout, and they broke and fled.
Multitudes were cut down as they fled, other multitudes were swept away
by the devouring Danube as they tried to cross its current; some, half
dead, reached the other side, and saved their lives in fortresses,
guarding the steep cliffs beyond the Danube. Few, very few they were who
ever saw their native land again.

There was great rejoicing in the Roman army and in the Roman camp when
Constantine returned in triumph with the wondrous Cross borne before
him.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He passed on to
the city, and the people of Rome gazed with awe on the token of the
Unknown God who had saved their city, but none would say who that God
might be.

### A Council Summoned

The emperor summoned a great council of all the wisest men in Rome, and
when all were met he raised the Standard of the Cross in the midst and
said:

"Can any man tell me, by spells or by ancient lore,  
Who is the gracious God, giver of victory,  
Who came in His glory, with the Cross for His token,  
Who rescued my people and gave me the victory,  
Scattered my foemen and put the fierce Huns to flight,  
Showed me in heaven His sign of deliverance,  
The loveliest Cross of light, gleaming in glory?"  
                                                  *Elene*.

At first no man could give him any answer--perhaps none dared--till
after a long silence the wisest of all arose and said he had heard that
the Cross was the sign of Christ the King of Heaven, and that the
knowledge of His way was only revealed to men in baptism. When strict
search was made some Christians were found, who preached the way of life
to Constantine, and rejoiced that they might tell before men of the life
and death, the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ, who redeemed
mankind from the bonds of evil; and then Constantine, being fully
instructed and convinced, was baptized and became the first Christian
emperor.

### Constantine Desires to Find our Saviour's Cross

Constantine's heart, however, was too full of love for his new Lord to
let him rest satisfied without some visible token of Christ's sojourn on
earth. He longed

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

to have, to keep for his own, one thing at least which Jesus had touched
during His life, and his thoughts turned chiefly to that Cross which had
been to himself both the sign of triumph and the guide to the way of
life. Thus he again called together his Christian teachers, and inquired
more closely where Christ had suffered.

"In Judæa, outside the walls of Jerusalem, He died on the Cross," they
told him.

"Then there, near that city, so blest and so curst, we must seek His
precious Cross," cried Constantine.

### Summons his Mother Elene

Forthwith he summoned from Britain his mother, the British Princess
Elene, and when she had been taught the truth, had been converted and
baptized, he told her of his heart's desire, and begged her to journey
to Jerusalem and seek the sacred Cross.

Elene herself, when she heard Constantine's words, was filled with
wonder, and said: "Dear son, thy words have greatly rejoiced my heart,
for know that I, too, have seen a vision, and would gladly seek the Holy
Cross, where it lies hidden from the eyes of men."

### Elene's Vision

"Now will I tell thee the brightest of visions,  
Dreamt at the midnight when men lay in slumber.  
Hovering in heaven saw I a radiant Cross,  
Gloriously gold-adorned, shining in splendour;  
Starry gems shone on it at the four corners,  
Flashed from the shoulder-span five gleaming jewels.  
Angels surrounded it, guarding it gladly.  
Yet in its loveliness sad was that Cross to see,  
For 'heath the gold and gems fast blood flowed from it,  
Till it was all defiled with the dark drops."  
                                       *Dream of the Rood*.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

In this dream of Elene's the Cross spoke to her, and told her of the sad
fate which had made of that hapless tree the Cross on which the Redeemer
of mankind had released the souls of men from evil, on which He had
spread out His arms to embrace mankind, had bowed His head, weary with
the strife, and had given up His soul. All creation wept that hour, for
Christ was on the Cross.

"Yet His friends came to him, left not His corpse alone,  
Took down the Mighty King from His sharp sufferings--  
Humbly I bowed myself down to the hands of men.  
Sadly they laid Him down in His dark rock-hewn grave,  
Sadly they sang for Him dirges for death-doomed ones,  
Sadly they left Him there as His fair corpse grew cold.  
We, the three Crosses, stood mournful in loneliness,  
Till evil-thinking men felled us all three to ground,  
Sank us deep into earth, sealed us from sight of man."  
                                                *Dream of the Rood*.

### She Undertakes the Quest

As Constantine had been guided by the heavenly vision of the True Cross,
so now Elene would journey to the land of the Jews and find the reality
of that Holy Cross. Her will and that of her son were one in this
matter, so that before long the whole city resounded with the bustle and
clamour of preparation, for Elene was to travel with the pomp and
retinue befitting the mother of the Emperor of Rome.

"There by the Wendel Sea stood the wave-horses.  
Proudly the plunging ships sought out the ocean path.  
Line followed after line of the tall brine-ploughs.  
Forth went the water-steeds o'er the sea-serpent's road  
Bright shields on the bulwarks oft broke the foaming surge,  
Ne’er saw I lady lead such a fair following!"  
                                                    *Elene*.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

### She Comes to Judæa

Queen Elene had a prosperous voyage, and, after touching at the land of
the Greeks, reached in due time the country of Judæa, and so, with good
hope, came to Jerusalem. There, in the emperor's name, she summoned to
an assembly all the oldest and wisest Jews, a congregation of a thousand
venerable rabbis, learned in all the books of the Law and the Prophets,
and proud that they were the Chosen People in a world of heathens,
aliens from the True God. These she addressed at first with a blending
of flattery and reproach--flattery for the Chosen People, reproach for
their perversity of wickedness--and, finally, peremptorily demanded an
answer to any question she might ask of them. The Jews withdrew and
deliberated sadly whether they durst refuse the request of so mighty a
person as the emperor's mother, and, deciding that they durst not,
returned to the hall where Elene sat in splendour on her throne and
announced their readiness to reply to all her questions. Elene, however,
bade them first lessen their numbers. They chose five hundred to reply
for them, and on these she poured such bitter reproaches that they at
last exclaimed:

"Lady, we learnt of yore laws of the Hebrew folk  
Which all our fathers learnt from the true ark of God.  
Lady, we know not now why thou thus blamest us;  
How has the Jewish race done grievous wrong to thee?"  
                                                       *Elene*.

### She Cross-questions the Rabbis

Elene only replied: "Go ye away, and choose out from among these five
hundred those whose wisdom is great enough to show them without delay
the answer to all things I require"; and again they left he presence.
When they were alone, one of them, named Judas,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

said: "I know what this queen requires: she will demand to know from us
where the Cross is concealed on which the Lord of the Christians was
crucified; but if we tell this secret I know well that the Jews will
cease to bear rule on the earth, and our holy scriptures will he
forgotten. For my grandfather Zacchæus, as he lay dying, bade me confess
the truth if ever man should inquire concerning the Holy Tree; and when
I asked how our nation had failed to recognise the Holy and Just One, he
told me that he had always withdrawn himself from the evil deeds of his
generation, and their leaders had been blinded by their own
unrighteousness, and had slain the Lord of Glory. And he ended:

"'Thus I and my father secretly held the Faith.  
Now warn I thee, my son, speak not thou mockingly  
Of the true Son of God reigning in glory:  
For whom my Stephen died, and the Apostle Paul.'  
                                                       *Elene*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now," said Judas,
"since things are so, decide ye what we shall reveal, or what conceal,
if this queen asks us."

### One Appointed to Answer her

The other elders replied: "Do what seems to thee best, since thou alone
knowest this. Never have we heard of these strange secrets. Do thou
according to thy great wisdom."

While they still deliberated came the heralds with silver trumpets,
which they blew, proclaiming aloud:

"The mighty Queen calls you, O men, to the Council,  
That she may hear from you of your decision.  
Great is the need ye have of all your wisdom."  
                                                *Elene*.

Slowly and reluctantly the Jewish rabbis returned to the
council-chamber, and listened to Elene as she

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

plied them with questions about the ancient prophecies and the death of
Christ; but to all her inquiries they professed entire ignorance, until,
in her wrath, the queen threatened them with death by fire. Then they
led forward Judas, saying: "He can reveal the mysteries of Fate, for he
is of noble race, the son of a prophet. He will tell thee truth, O
Queen, as thy soul loveth." Thus Elene let the other Jews go in peace,
and took Judas for a hostage.

### She Threatens him

Now Elene greeted Judas and said:

"Lo, thou perverse one, two things lie before thee,  
Or death or life for thee: choose which thou wilt."  
                                                 *Elene*.

Judas replied to her, since he could not escape:

"If the starved wanderer lost on the barren moors  
Sees both a stone and bread, easily in his reach,  
Which, O Queen, thinkest thou he will reject?"  
                                                  *Elene*.

Thereupon Elene said: "If thou wouldst dwell in heaven with the angels,
reveal to me where the True Cross lies hidden." Now Judas was very sad,
for his choice lay between death and the revealing of the fateful
secret, but he still tried to evade giving an answer, protesting that
too long a time had passed for the secret to be known. Elene retorted
that the Trojan War was a still more ancient story, and yet was still
well known; but Judas replied that men are bound to remember the valiant
deeds of nations; he himself had never even heard the story of which she
spoke. This obstinacy angered the queen greatly, and she demanded to be
taken at once to the hill of Calvary, that she might

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

purify it, for the sake of Him who died there; but Judas only repeated:

"I know not the place, nor aught of that field."  
                                              *Elene*.

Queen Elene was yet more enraged by his stubborn denials, and determined
to obtain by force an answer to her questions. Calling her servants, she
bade them thrust Judas into a deep dry cistern, where he lay, starving,
bound hand and foot, for seven nights and days. On the seventh day his
stubborn spirit yielded, and Judas lifted up his voice and called aloud,
saying:

"Now I beseech you all by the great God of heaven  
That you will lift me up out of this misery.  
I will tell all I know of that True Holy Cross,  
Now I no longer can hide it for heavy pain.  
Hunger has daunted me through all these dreary days.  
Foolish was I of yore; late I confess it."  
                                                 *Elene*.

### He Guides her to Calvary

The message was brought to Elene where she waited to hear tidings, and
she bade her servants lift the weakened Judas from the dark pit; then
they led him, half dead with hunger, out of the city to the hill of
Calvary. There Judas prayed to the God whom he now feared and worshipped
for a sign, some token to guide them in their search for the Holy Cross.
As he prayed a sweet-smelling vapour, curling upwards like the
incense-wreaths around the altar, rose to the skies from the summit of
the hill. The sign was manifest to all, and Judas gave thanks to God for
His great mercy; then, bidding the wondering soldiers help him, he began
to dig. By this time all men knew what they sought, and each wished to
uncover the holy relic, so that all dug with great zeal, until, under
twenty feet of earth,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

they uncovered three crosses, so well preserved that they lay in the
earth just as the Jews had hidden them.

### Three Crosses Found

Judas and all rejoiced greatly at this marvel, and, reverently raising
the three crosses, they bore them into the city, and laid them at the
feet of Queen Elene, whose first rapture of joy was speedily turned to
perplexity as she realised that she knew not which was that sacred Cross
on which the King of Angels had suffered. "For," she said, "two thieves
were crucified with him." But even Judas could not clear her doubts.

"Lo we have heard of this from all the holy books,  
That there were with him two in His deep anguish.  
They hung in death by Him; He was Himself the third.  
Heaven was all darkened o’er at that dread moment.  
Say, if thou rightly canst, which of these crosses  
Is that blest Tree of Fate which bore the Heaven's King."  
                                                       *Elene*.

### A Miracle to Reveal our Saviour's Cross

Judas, however, suggested that the crosses should be carried to the
midst of the city, and that they should pray for another miracle to
reveal the truth. This was done at dawn, and the triumphant band of
Christians raised hymns of prayer and praise until the ninth hour; then
came a mighty crowd bearing a young man lifeless on his bier. At Judas's
command they laid down the bier, and he, praying to God, solemnly raised
in turn each of the crosses and held it above the dead man's head.
Lifeless still he lay as Judas raised the first two, but when he held
above the corpse the third, the True Cross, the dead man arose
instantly, body and soul reunited, one in praising God, and the whole
multitude broke out into shouts of thanksgiving to the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lord of Hosts, and
the sacred relic was restored to the loving care of the queen.

### The Nails Sought for

Nevertheless Elene's longing was still unsatisfied. She called Judas
(whose new name in baptism was Cyriacus) and begged him to fulfil her
desires, and to pray to God that she might find the nails which had
pierced the Lord of Life, where they lay hidden from men in the ground
of Calvary. Leading her out of the town, Cyriacus again prayed on Mount
Calvary that God would send forth a token and reveal the secret. As he
prayed there came from heaven a leaping flame, brighter than the sun,
which touched the surface of the ground here and there, and kindled in
each place a tiny star. When they dug at the spots where the stars shone
they found each nail shining visibly and casting a radiance of its own
in the dark earth. So Elene had obtained her heart's desire, and had now
the True Cross and the Holy Nails.

### Good News Brought to Constantine

Word of his mother's success was sent to the Emperor Constantine, and he
was asked what should be done with these glorious relics. He bade Elene
build in Jerusalem a glorious church, and make therein a beautiful
shrine of silver, where the Holy Cross should be guarded for all
generations by priests who should watch it day and night. This was done,
but the nails were still Elene's possession, and she was at a loss how
to preserve these holy relics, when the devout Cyriacus, now ordained
Bishop of Jerusalem, went to her and said: "O lady and queen, take these
precious nails for thy son the emperor. Make with them rings for his
horse's bridle. Victory shall ever go with them; they

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

shall be called Holy to God, and he shall be called blessed whom that
horse bears." The advice pleased the queen, and she had wrought a
glorious bridle, adorned with the Holy Nails, and sent it to her son.
Constantine received it with all reverence, and ordained that April 24,
the day of the miracle of revelation, should henceforth be kept in
honour as "Holy Cross Day." Thus were the emperor's zeal and the royal
mother's devotion rewarded, and Christendom was enriched by some of its
most precious treasures, the True Cross and the Holy Nails.
