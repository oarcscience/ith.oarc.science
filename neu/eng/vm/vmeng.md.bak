# THE LIFE OF MERLIN

 

I am preparing to sing the madness of the prophetic bard, and a humorous
poem on Merlin; pray correct the song, Robert <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md), glory of bishops, by restraining my pen. 
For we know that Philosophy has poured over you its divine nectar, and
has made you famous in all things, that you might serve as an example, a
leader and a teacher in the world.  Therefore may you favour my attempt,
and see fit to look upon the poet with better auspices than you did that
other whom you have just succeeded, promoted to an honour that you
deserve.  For indeed you habits, and your approved life, and your birth,
and your usefulness to the position, and the clergy and the people all
were seeking it for you, and from this circumstance happy Lincoln is
just now exalted to the stars.  On this account I might wish you to be
embraced in a fitting song, but I am not equal to the task, even though
Orpheus, and Camerinus <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md), and Macer, and
Marius, and mighty-voiced Rabirius were all to sing with my mouth and
all the Muses were to accompany me.  But now, Sisters, accustomed to
sing with me, let us sing the work proposed, and strike the cithara.

 

Well then, after many years had passed under many kings, Merlin the
Briton was held famous in the world.  He was a king and prophet; to the
proud people of the South Welsh he gave laws, and to the chieftains he
prophesied the future.  Meanwhile it happened that a strife arose <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) between several of the chiefs of the
kingdom, and throughout the cities they wasted the innocent people with
fierce war. <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)  Peredur, king of the
North Welsh, made war on Gwenddoleu, who ruled the realm of Scotland;
and already the day fixed for the battle was at hand, and the leaders
were ready in the field, and the troops were fighting, falling on both
sides in a miserable slaughter.  Merlin had come to the war with Peredur
and so had Rhydderch, king of the Cumbrians, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) both savage men.  They slew the opposing
enemy with their hateful swords, and three brothers of the prince <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) who had followed him through his wars,
always fighting, cut down and broke the battle lines.  Thence they
rushed fiercely through the crowded ranks with such an attack that they
soon fell killed.  At this sight, Merlin, you grieved and poured out sad
complaints throughout the army, and cried out in these words, “Could
injurious fate be so harmful as to take from me so many and such great
companions, whom recently so many kings and so many remote kingdoms
feared?  O dubious lot of mankind!  O death ever near, which has them
always in its power, and strikes its hidden goad and drives out the
wretched life from the body!  O glorious youths, who now will stand by
my side in arms, and with me will repel the chieftains coming to harm
me, and the hosts rushing in upon me?  Bold young men your audacity has
taken from you your pleasant years and pleasant youth!  You who so
recently were rushing in arms through the troops, cutting down on every
side those who resisted you, now are beating the ground and are red with
red blood!”  So among the hosts he lamented with flowing tears, and
mourned for the men, and the savage battle was unceasing.  The lines
rushed together, enemies were slain by enemies, blood flowed everywhere,
and people died on both sides.  But at length the Britons assembled
their troops from all quarters and all together rushing in arms they
fell upon the Scots and wounded them and cut them down, nor did they
rest until the hostile battalions turned their backs and fled through
unfrequented ways.

 

Merlin called his companions out from the battle and bade them bury the
brothers in a richly coloured chapel; and he bewailed the men and did
not cease to pour out laments, and he strewed dust on his hair and rent
his garments, and prostrate on the ground rolled now hither and now
thither.  Peredur strove to console him and so did the nobles and
princes, but he would not be comforted nor put up with their beseeching
words.  He had now lamented for three whole days and had refused food,
so great was the grief that consumed him.  Then when he had filled the
air with so many and so great complaints, new fury seized him <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) and he departed secretly, and fled to the
woods not wishing to be seen as he fled.  He entered the wood and
rejoiced to lie hidden under the ash trees; he marvelled at the wild
beasts feeding on the grass of the glades; now he chased after them and
again he flew past them; he lived on the roots of grasses and on the
grass, on the fruit of the trees and on the mulberries of the thicket. 
He became a silvan man just as though devoted to the woods.  For a whole
summer after this, hidden like a wild animal, he remained buried in the
woods, found by no one and forgetful of himself and of his kindred.  But
when the winter came and took away all the grass and the fruit of the
trees and he had nothing to live on, he poured out the following lament
in a wretched voice.

 

“Christ, God of heaven, <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) what shall I
do?  In what part of the world can I stay, since I see nothing here I
can live on, neither grass on the ground nor acorns on the trees?  Here
once there stood nineteen apple trees <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)
bearing apples every year; now they are not standing.  Who has taken
them away from me?  Whither have they gone all of a sudden?  Now I see
them - now I do not!  Thus the fates fight against me and for me, since
they both permit and forbid me to see.  Now I lack the apples and
everything else.  The trees stand without leaves, without fruit; I am
afflicted by both circumstances since I cannot cover myself with the
leaves or eat the fruit.  Winter and the south wind with its falling
rain have taken them all away.  If by chance I find some navews
\[turnips\] deep in the ground the hungry swine and the voracious boars
rush up and snatch them away from me as I dig them up from the turf. 
You, O wolf, dear companion, accustomed to roam with me through the
secluded paths of the woods and meadows, now can scarcely get across
fields; hard hunger has weakened both you and me.  You lived in these
woods before I did and age has whitened your hairs first.  You have
nothing to put into your mouth and do not know how to get anything, at
which I marvel, since the wood abounds in so many goats and other wild
beasts that you might catch.  Perhaps that detestable old age of yours
has taken away your strength and prevented your following the chase. 
Now, as the only thing left to you, you fill the air with howlings, and
stretched out on the ground you extend your wasted limbs.”

 

These words he was uttering among the shrubs and dense hazel thickets
when the sound reached a certain passer-by who turned his steps to the
place whence the sounds were rising in the air, and found the place and
found the speaker.  As soon as Merlin saw him he departed, and the
traveller followed him, but was unable to overtake the man as he fled. 
Thereupon he resumed his journey and went about his business, moved by
the lot of the fugitive.  Now this traveller was met by a man from the
court of Rhydderch, king of the Cumbrians, who was married to Ganieda
and happy in his beautiful wife.  She was sister to Merlin and, grieving
over the fate of her brother, she had sent her retainers to the woods
and the distant fields to bring him back.  One of these retainers came
toward the traveller and the latter at once went up to him and they fell
into conversation; the one who had been sent to find Merlin asked if the
other had seen him in the woods or the glades.  The latter admitted that
he had seen such a man among the bushy glades of the Calidonian
forest, <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) but, when he wished to speak
to him and sit down with him, the other had fled away swiftly among the
oaks.  These things he told, and the messenger departed and entered the
forest; he searched the deepest valleys and passed over the high
mountains; he sought everywhere for his man, going through the obscure
places.

 

On the very summit of a certain mountain there was a fountain,
surrounded on every side by hazel bushes and thick with shrubs.  There
Merlin had seated himself, and thence through all the woods he watched
the wild animals running and playing.  Thither the messenger climbed,
and with silent step went on up the heights seeking the man.  At last he
saw the fountain and Merlin sitting on the grass behind it, and making
his plaint in this manner.

 

“O Thou who rulest all things, how does it happen that the seasons are
not all the same, distinguished only by their four numbers?  Now spring,
according to its laws, provides flowers and leaves; summer gives crops,
autumn ripe apples; icy winter follows and devours and wastes all the
others, bringing rain and snow, and keeps them all away and harms with
its tempests.  And it does not permit the ground to produce variegated
\[various?\] flowers, or the oak trees acorns, or the apple trees dark
red apples.  O that there were no winter or white frost!  That it were
spring or summer, and that the cuckoo would come back singing, and the
nightingale who softens sad hearts with her devoted song, and the turtle
dove keeping her chaste vows, and that in new foliage other birds should
sing in harmonious measures, delighting me with their music, while a new
earth should breathe forth odours from new flowers under the green
grass; that the fountains would also flow on every side with their
gentle murmurs, and near by, under the leaves, the dove would pour forth
her soothing laments and incite to slumber.”

 

The messenger heard the prophet and broke off his lament with cadences
on the cither he had brought with him that with it he might attract and
soften the madman. <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)  Therefore
making plaintive sounds with his fingers and striking the strings in
order, he lay hidden behind him and sang in a low voice, “O the dire
groanings of mournful Guendoloena!  O the wretched tears of weeping
Guendoloena!  I grieve for wretched dying Guendoloena!  There was not
among the Welsh a woman more beautiful than she.  She surpassed in
fairness the goddesses, and the petals of the privet, and the blooming
roses and the fragrant lilies of the fields.  The glory of spring shone
in her alone, and she had the splendour of the stars in her two eyes,
and splendid hair shining with the gleam of gold.  All this has
perished; all beauty has departed from her, both colour and figure and
also the glory of her snowy flesh.  Now, worn with much weeping, she is
not what she was, for she does not know where the prince has gone, or
whether he is alive or dead; therefore the wretched woman languishes and
is totally wasted away through her long grief.  With similar laments
Ganieda weeps with her, and without consolation grieves for her lost
brother.  One weeps for her brother and the other for her husband, and
both devote themselves to weeping and spend their time in sadness.  No
food nourishes them, nor does any sleep refresh them wandering at night
through the brushwood, so great is the grief that consumes them both. 
Not otherwise did Sidonian Dido grieve when the ships had weighed anchor
and Aeneas was in haste to depart; so most wretched Phyllis groaned and
wept when Demophoon did not come back at the appointed time; thus
Briseis wept for the absent Achilles. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)  Thus the sister and the wife grieve
together, and burn continually and completely with inward agonies.”

 

The messenger sang thus to his plaintive lyre, and with his music
soothed the ears of the prophet that he might become more gentle and
rejoice with the singer.  Quickly the prophet arose and addressed the
young man with pleasant words, and begged him to touch once more the
strings with his fingers and to sing again his former song.  The latter
therefore set his fingers to the lyre and played over again the song
that was asked for, and by his playing compelled the man, little by
little, to put aside his madness, captivated by the sweetness of the
lute.  So Merlin became mindful of himself, and he recalled what he used
to be, and he wondered at his madness and he hated it.  His former mind
returned and his sense came back to him, and, moved by affection, he
groaned at the names of his sister and of his wife, since his mind was
now restored to him, and he asked to be led to the court of King
Rhydderch.  The other obeyed him, and straightway they left the woods
and came, rejoicing together, to the city of the king.  So the queen was
delighted by regaining her brother and the wife became glad over the
return of her husband.  They vied with each other in kissing him and
they twined their arms about his neck, so great was the affection that
moved them.  The king also received him with such honour as was fitting,
and the chieftains who thronged the palace rejoiced in the city.

 

But when Merlin saw such great crowds of men present he was not able to
endure them; he went mad again, and, filled anew with fury, he wanted to
go to the woods, and he tried to get away by stealth.  Then Rhydderch
ordered him to be restrained and a guard posted over him, and his
madness to be softened with the cither; and he stood about him grieving,
and with imploring words begged the man to be sensible and to stay with
him, and not to long for the grove or to live like a wild beast, or to
want to abide under the trees when he might hold a royal sceptre and
rule over a warlike people.  After that he promised that he would give
him many gifts, and he ordered people to bring him clothing and birds,
dogs and swift horses, gold and shining gems, and cups that Wayland had
engraved in the city of Segontium. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) 
Every one of these things Rydderch offered to the prophet and urged him
to stay with him and leave the woods.

 

The prophet rejected these gifts, saying, “Let the dukes who are
troubled by their own poverty have these, they who are not satisfied
with a moderate amount but desire a great deal.  To these gifts I prefer
the groves and broad oaks of Calidon, and the lofty mountains with green
pastures at their feet.  Those are the things that please me, not these
of yours - take these away with you, King Rhydderch.  My Calidonian
forest rich in nuts, the forest that I prefer to everything else, shall
have me.”

 

Finally since the king could not retain the sad man by any gifts, he
ordered him to be bound with a strong chain lest, if free, he might seek
the deserted groves.  The prophet, when he felt the chains around him
and he could not go as a free man to the Calidonian forests, straightway
fell to grieving and remained sad and silent, and took all joy from his
face so that he did not utter a word or smile.

 

Meanwhile the queen was going through the hall looking for the king, and
he, as was proper, greeted her as she came and took her by the hand and
bade her sit down, and, embracing her, pressed her lips in a kiss.  In
so doing he turned his face toward her and saw a leaf hanging in her
hair; <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) he reached out his fingers,
took it and threw it on the ground, and jested joyfully with the woman
he loved.  The prophet turned his eyes in that direction and smiled, and
made the the men standing about look at him in wonder since he was not
in the habit of smiling.  The king too wondered and urged the madman to
tell the cause of his sudden laugh, and he added to his words many
gifts.  The other was silent and put off explaining his laugh.  But more
and more Rhydderch continued to urge him with riches and with entreaties
until at length the prophet, vexed at him, said in return for his gift,
“A miser loves a gift and a greedy man labours to get one; these are
easily corrupted by gifts and bend their minds in any direction they are
bidden to.  What they have is not enough for them, but for me the acorns
of pleasant Calidon and the shining fountains flowing through fragrant
meadows are sufficient.  I am not attracted by gifts; let the miser take
his, and unless liberty is given me and I go back to the green woodland
valleys I shall refuse to explain my laughter.”

 

Therefore when Rhydderch found that he could not influence the prophet
by any gift, and he could not find out the reason for the laughter,
straightway he ordered the chains to be loosed and gave him permission
to seek the deserted groves, that he might be willing to give the
desired explanation.  Then Merlin, rejoicing that he could go, said,
“This is the reason I laughed, Rhydderch.  You were by a single act both
praiseworthy and blameworthy.  When just now you removed the leaf that
the queen had in her hair without knowing it, you acted more faithfully
toward her than she did toward you when she went under the bush where
her lover met her and lay with her; and while she was lying there supine
with her hair spread out, by chance there caught in it the leaf that
you, not knowing all this, removed.”

 

Rhydderch suddenly became sad at this accusation and turned his face
from her and cursed the day he had married her.  But she, not at all
moved, hid her shame behind a smiling face and said to her husband, “Why
are you sad, my love?  Why do you become so angry over this thing and
blame me unjustly, and believe a madman who, lacking sound sense, mixes
lies with the truth?  The man who believes him becomes many times more a
fool than he is.  Now then, watch, and if I am not mistaken I will show
you that he is crazy and has not spoken the truth.”

 

There was in the hall a certain boy, one of many, and the ingenious
woman catching sight of him straightway thought of a novel trick by
which she might convict her brother of falsehood. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)  So she ordered the boy to come in and
asked her brother to predict by what death the lad should die.  He
answered, “Dearest sister, he shall die, when a man, by falling from a
high rock.”  Smiling at these words, she ordered the boy to go away and
take off the clothes he was wearing and put on others and to cut off his
long hair; she bade him come back to them thus that he might seem to
them a different person.  The boy obeyed her, for he came back to them
with his clothes changed as he had been ordered to do.  Soon the queen
asked her brother again, “Tell your dear sister what the death of this
boy will be like.”  Merlin answered, “This boy when he grows up shall,
while out of his mind, meet with a violent death in a tree.”  When he
had finished she said to her husband, “Could this false prophet lead you
so far astray as to make you believe that I had committed so great a
crime?  And if you will notice with how much sense he has spoken this
about the boy, you will believe that the things he said about me were
made up so that he might get away to the woods.  Far be it from me to do
such a thing!  I shall keep my bed chaste, and chaste shall I always be
while the breath of life is in me.  I convicted him of falsehood when I
asked him about the death of the boy.  Now I shall do it again; pay
attention and judge.”

 

When she had said this she told the boy in an aside to go out and put on
woman’s clothing, and to come back thus.  Soon the boy left and did as
he was bid, for he came back in woman’s clothes just as though he were a
woman, and stood in front of Merlin to whom the queen said banteringly,
“Say brother, tell me about the death of this girl.”  “Girl or not she
shall die in the river,” said her brother to her, which made King
Rhydderch laugh at his reasoning; since when asked about the death of a
single boy Merlin had predicted three different kinds.  Therefore
Rhydderch thought he had spoken falsely about the queen, and did not
believe him, but grieved, and hated the fact that he had trusted him and
had condemned his beloved.  The queen, seeing this, forgave him and
kissed and caressed him and made him joyful.

 

Meanwhile Merlin planned to go to the woods, and he left his dwelling
and ordered the gates to be opened; but his sister stood in his way and
with rising tears begged him to remain with her for a while and to put
aside his madness.  The hard-hearted man would not desist from his
project but kept trying to open the doors, and he strove to leave and
raged and fought and by his clamour forced the servants to open.  At
length, since no one could hold him back when he wanted to go, the queen
quickly ordered Guendoloena, who was absent, to come to make him
desist.  She came and on her knees begged him to remain; but he spurned
her prayers and would not stay, nor would he, as he was accustomed to
do, look upon her with a joyful face.  She grieved and dissolved in
tears and tore her hair, and scratched her cheeks with her nails and
rolled on the ground as though dying.  The queen seeing this said to
him, “This Guendoloena who is dying thus for you, what shall she do? 
Shall she marry again or do you bid her remain a widow, or go with you
wherever you are going?  For she will go, and with you she will joyfully
inhabit the groves and the green woodland meadows provided she has your
love.”  To this the prophet answered, “Sister I do not want a cow that
pours out water in a broad fountain like the urn of the Virgin in
summer-time, nor shall I change my care as Orpheus once did when
Eurydice gave her baskets to the boys to hold before she swam back
across the Stygian sands.  Freed from both of you I shall remain without
the taint of love.  Let her therefore be given a proper opportunity to
marry and let him whom she shall choose have her.  But let the man who
marries her be careful that he never gets in my way or comes near me;
let him keep away for fear lest if I happen to meet him he may feel my
flashing sword.  But when the day of the solemn \[formal\] wedding comes
and the different viands are distributed to the guests, I shall be
present in person, furnished with seemly gifts, and I shall profusely
endow Guendoloena when she is given away.”  When he had finished he said
farewell to each of them and went away, and with no one to hinder him he
went back to the woods he longed for.

 

Guendoloena remained sadly in the door watching him and so did the
queen, both moved by what had happened to their friend, and they
marvelled that a madman should be so familiar with secret things and
should have known of the love affair of his sister.  Nevertheless they
thought that he lied about the death of the boy since he told of three
different deaths when he should have told of one.  Therefore his speech
seemed for long years to be an empty one until the time when the boy
grew to manhood; then it was made apparent to all and convincing to
many.  For while he was hunting with his dogs he caught sight of a stag
hiding in a grove of trees; he loosed the dogs who, as soon as they saw
the stag, climbed through unfrequented ways and filled the air with
their baying.  He urged on his horse with his spurs and followed after,
and urged on the huntsmen, directing them, now with his horn and now
with his voice, and he bade them go more quickly.  There was a high
mountain surrounded on all sides by rocks with a stream flowing through
the plain at its foot; thither the animal fled until he came to the
river, seeking a hiding place after the usual manner of its kind.  The
young man pressed on and passed straight over the mountain, hunting for
the stag among the rocks lying about.  Meanwhile it happened, while his
impetuosity was leading him on, that his horse slipped from a high rock
and the man fell over a precipice into the river, but so that one of his
feet caught in a tree, and the rest of his body was submerged in the
stream.  Thus he fell, and was drowned, and hung from a tree, and by his
threefold death made the prophet a true one.

 

The latter meanwhile had gone to the woods and was living like a wild
beast, subsisting on frozen moss, in the snow, in the rain, in the cruel
blasts of the wind.  And this pleased him more than administering laws
throughout his cities and ruling over fierce people.  Meanwhile
Guendoloena, since her husband was leading a life like this with his
woodland flock through the passing years, was married in accordance with
her husband’s permission.

 

It was night and the horns of the bright moon were shining, and all the
lights of the vault of heaven were gleaming; the air was clearer than
usual, for cruel, frigid, Boreas had driven away the clouds and had made
the sky serene again and had dried up the mists with his arid breath. 
From the top of a lofty mountain the prophet was regarding the courses
of the stars, speaking to himself out in the open air.  “What does this
ray of Mars mean?  Does its fresh redness mean that one king is dead and
that there shall be another?  So I see it, for Constantine has died and
his nephew Conan, through an evil fate and the murder of his uncle, has
taken the crown and is king. <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)  And
you, highest Venus, who slipping along within your ordered limits
beneath the zodiac are accompanying the sun in his course, what about
this double ray of yours that is cleaving the air?  Does not its
division indicate a severing of my love?  Such a ray indeed shows that
loves are divided.  Perhaps Guendoloena has left me in my absence and
now clings to another man and rejoices in his embraces.  So I lose; so
another enjoys her.  So my rights are taken away from me while I dally. 
So it is surely, for a slothful lover is beaten by one who is not
slothful or absent but is right on hand.  But I am not jealous; let her
marry now under favourable auspices and let her enjoy her new husband
with my permission.  And when tomorrow’s sun shall shine I will go and
take with me the gift I promised her when I left.”  So he spoke and went
about all the woods and groves and collected a herd of stags in a single
line, and the deer and she-goats likewise, and he himself mounted a
stag. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)  And when day dawned he came
quickly, driving the line before him to the place where Guendoloena was
to be married.  When he arrived he forced the stags to stand patiently
outside the gates while he cried aloud, “Guendoloena!  Guendoloena! 
Come!  Your presents are looking for you!”  Guendoloena therefore came
quickly, smiling and marvelling that the man was riding on the stag and
that it obeyed him, and that he could get together so large a number of
animals and drive them before him just as a shepherd does the sheep that
he is in the habit of driving to the pastures.

 

The bridegroom stood watching from a lofty window and marvelling at the
rider on his seat, and he laughed.  But when the prophet saw him and
understood who he was, at once he wrenched the horns from the stag he
was riding and shook them and threw them at the man and completely
smashed his head in, and killed him and drove out his life into the
air.  With a quick blow of his heels he set the stag flying and was on
his way back to the woods.  At these happenings the servants rushed out
from all sides and quickly followed the prophet through the fields.  But
he ran ahead so fast that he would have reached the woods untouched if a
river had not been in his way; while his beast was hurriedly leaping
over the torrent Merlin slipped from his back and fell into the rapid
waves.  The servants lined the shore and captured him as he swam, and
bound him and took him home and gave him to his sister.

 

The prophet, captured in this way, became sad and wanted to go back to
the woods, and he fought to break his bonds and refused to smile or to
take food or drink, and by his sadness he made his sister sad. 
Rhydderch, therefore, seeing him drive all joy from him and refuse to
taste of the banquets that had been prepared for him, took pity on him
and ordered him to be led out into the city, through the market place
among the people, in the hope that he might be cheered up by going and
seeing the novelties that were being sold there.

 

After he had been taken out and was going away from the palace he saw
before a door a servant of a poor appearance, the doorkeeper, asking
with trembling lips of all the passers-by some money with which to get
his clothes mended. <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md)  The prophet
thereupon stood still and laughed, wondering at the poor man.  When he
had gone on from here he saw a young man holding some new shoes and
buying some pieces of leather to patch them with.  Then he laughed again
and refused to go further through the market place to be stared at by
the people he was watching.  But he yearned for the woods, toward which
he frequently looked back, and to which, although forbidden, he tried to
direct his steps.

 

The servants returned home and told that he had laughed twice and also
that he had tried to get away to the woods.  Rhydderch, who wished to
know what he had meant by his laughter, quickly gave orders for his
bonds to be loosed and gave him permission to go back to his accustomed
woods if only he would explain why he laughed.  The prophet, now quite
joyful, answered, “The doorkeeper was sitting outside the doors in well
worn clothing and kept asking those who went by to give him something to
buy clothes with, just as though he had been a pauper, and all the time
he was secretly a rich man and had under him hidden piles of coins. 
That is what I laughed at; turn up the ground under him and you will
find coins preserved there for a long time.  From there they led me
further toward the market place and I saw a man buying some shoes and
also some patches so that after the shoes were wornout and had holes in
them from use he might mend them and make them fit for service again. 
This too I laughed at since the poor man will not be able to use the
shoes nor,” he added, “the patches, since he is already drowned in the
waves and is floating toward the shore; go and you will see.” 
Rhydderch, wishing to test the man’s sayings, ordered his servants to go
quickly along the bank of the river, so that if they should chance to
find such a man drowned by the shore they might at once bring him word. 
They obeyed the king’s orders, for going along the the river they found
a drowned man in a waste patch of sand, and returned home and reported
the fact to him.  But the king meanwhile, after sending away the
doorkeeper, had dug and turned up the ground and found a treasure placed
under it, and laughingly he worshipped the prophet.

 

After these things had happened the prophet was making haste to go to
the woods he was accustomed to, hating the people in the city.  The
queen advised him to stay with her and to put off his desired trip to
the woods until the cold of white winter, which was then at hand, should
be over, and summer should return again with its tender fruits on which
he could live while the weather grew warm from the sun.  He refused, and
desirous of departing and scorning the winter he said to her, “O dear
sister, why do you labour to hold me back?  Winter with his tempests
cannot frighten me, nor icy Boreas when he rages with his cruel blasts
and suddenly injures the flocks of sheep with hail; neither does Auster
disturb me when its rain clouds shed their waters.  Why should I not
seek the deserted groves and the green woodlands?  Content with a little
I can endure the frost.  There under the leaves of the trees among the
odorous blossoms I shall take pleasure in lying through the summer; but
lest I lack food in winter you might build me a house in the woods and
have servants in it to wait on me and prepare me food when the ground
refuses to produce grain or the trees fruit.  Before the other buildings
build me a remote one with seventy doors and as many windows through
which I may watch fire-breathing Phoebus and Venus and the stars gliding
from the heavens by night, all of whom shall show me what is going to
happen to the people of the kingdom.  And let the same number of scribes
be at hand, trained to take my dictation, and let them be attentive to
record my prophecy on their tablets. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)  You too are to come often, dear sister,
and then you can relieve my hunger with food and drink.”  After he had
finished speaking he departed hastily for the woods.

 

His sister obeyed him and built the place he had asked for, and the
other houses and whatever else he had bid her.  But he, while the apples
remained and Phoebus was ascending higher through the stars, rejoiced to
remain beneath the leaves and to wander through the groves with their
soothing breezes.  Then winter came, harsh with icy winds, and despoiled
the ground and the trees of all their fruit, and Merlin lacked food
because the rains were at hand, and he came, sad and hungry, to the
aforesaid place.  Thither the queen often came and rejoiced to bring her
brother both food and drink.  He, after he had refreshed himself with
various kinds of edibles, would arise and express his approval of his
sister.  Then wandering about the house he would look at the stars while
he prophecied things like these which he knew were going to come to
pass.

 

“O madness of the Britons whom a plenitude, always excessive, of riches
exalts more than is seemly. <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md)  They
do not wish to enjoy peace but are stirred up by the Fury’s goad.  They
engage in civil wars and battles between relatives, and permit the
church of the Lord to fall into ruin; the holy bishops they drive into
remote lands.  The nephews of the Boar of Cornwall <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) cast everything into confusion, and
setting snares for each other engage in a mutual slaughter with their
wicked swords.  They do not wish to wait to get possession of the
kingdom lawfully, but seize the crown.  The fourth <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) from them shall be more cruel and more
harsh still; him shall a wolf from the sea conquer in fight and shall
drive defeated beyond the Severn through the kingdoms of the
barbarians.  This latter shall besiege Cirencester with a blockade and
with sparrows, and shall overthrow its walls to their very bases.  He
shall seek the Gauls in his ship, but shall die beneath the weapon of a
king.  Rhydderch shall die, <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) after
whom long discord shall hold the Scots and the Cumbrians for a long time
until Cumbria shall be granted to his growing tusk.  The Welsh shall
attack the men of Gwent, <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) and
afterwards those of Cornwall and no law shall restrain them.  Wales
shall rejoice in the shedding of blood; O people always hateful to God,
why do you rejoice in bloodshed?  Wales shall compel brothers to fight
and to condemn their own relatives to a wicked death.  The troops of the
Scots shall often cross the Humber and, putting aside all sentiment,
shall kill those who oppose them.  Not with impunity, however, for the
leader shall be killed; he shall have the name of a horse <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) and because of that fact shall be
fierce.  His heir shall be expelled and shall depart from our
territories.  Scots, sheathe your swords which you bare too readily;
your strength shall be unequal to that of our fierce people.  The city
of Dumbarton <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) shall be destroyed and
no king shall repair it for an age until the Scot shall be subdued in
war.  Carlisle, spoiled of its shepherd, shall lie vacant until the
sceptre of the Lion shall restore its pastoral staff. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)  Segontium and its towers and mighty
palaces shall lament in ruins until the Welsh return to their former
domains. <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md)  Porchester shall see its
broken walls in its harbour until a rich man with the tooth of a wolf
shall restore it.  The city of Richborough <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) shall lie spread out on the shore of its
harbour and a man from Flanders <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)
shall re-establish it with his crested ship.  The fifth from him shall
rebuild the walls of St David’s and shall bring back to her  the pall
lost for many years. <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md)  The City of
the Legions <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) shall fall into thy
bosom, O Severn, and shall lose her citizens for a long time, and these
the Bear in the Lamb <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) shall restore
to her when he shall come.

 

Saxon kings shall expel the citizens and shall hold cities, country, and
houses for a long time.  From among them thrice three dragons shall wear
the crown.  Two hundred monks shall perish in Leicester <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) and the Saxon shall drive out her ruler
and leave vacant her walls.  He who first among the Angles shall wear
the diadem of Brutus <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) shall repair
the city laid waste by slaughter.  A fierce people shall forbid the
sacrament of confirmation throughout the country, and in the house of
God shall place images of the gods.  Afterward Rome shall bring God back
through the medium of a monk and a holy priest shall sprinkle the
buildings with water and shall restore them again and shall place
shepherds in them.  Thereafter many of them shall obey the commands of
the divine law and shall enjoy heaven by right.  An impious people full
of poison shall violate that settlement and shall violently mix together
right and wrong.  They shall sell their sons and their kinsmen into the
furthest countries beyond the sea and shall incur the wrath of the
Thunderer.  O wretched crime! that man whom the founder of the world
created with liberty, deeming him worthy of heaven, should be sold like
an ox and be dragged away with a rope.  You miserable man who turned
traitor to your master when first you came to the throne, you shall
yield to God.  The Danes <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) shall come
upon \[you\] with their fleet and after subduing the people shall reign
for a short time and shall then be defeated and retire.  Two shall rule
over them <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) whom the serpent
forgetful of his treaty shall strike with the sting in his tail instead
of with the garland of his sceptre.

 

Then the Normans, <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) sailing over the
water in their wooden ships, bearing their faces in front and in back,
shall fiercely attack the Angles with their iron tunics and their fierce
swords, and shall destroy them and possess the field.  They shall
subjugate many realms to themselves and shall rule foreign peoples for a
time until the Fury, flying all about, shall scatter her poison over
them.  Then peace and faith and all virtue shall depart, and on all
sides throughout the country the citizens shall engage in battles.  Man
shall betray man and no one shall be found a friend.  The husband,
despising his wife, shall draw near to harlots, and the wife, despising
her husband, shall marry whom she desires.  There shall be no honour
kept for the church and the order shall perish.  Then shall bishops bear
arms, and armed camps shall be built.  Men shall build towers and walls
in holy ground, and they shall give to the soldiers what should belong
to the needy.  Carried away by riches they shall run along on the path
of worldly things and shall take from God what the holy bishop shall
forbid.  Three shall wear the diadem <span
id="fr_38"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) after whom shall be the favour of the
newcomers.  A fourth shall be in authority whom awkward piety shall
injure until he shall be clothed in his father, so that girded with
boar’s teeth he shall cross the shadow of the helmeted man. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[39](#fn_38.md)  Four shall be anointed, seeking in turn
the highest things, and two shall succeed who shall so wear the diadem
that they shall induce the Gauls to make war on them.  The sixth shall
overthrow the irish and their walls, and pious and prudent shall renew
the people and the cities.  All these things I formerly predicted more
at length to Vortigern in explaining to him the mystic war of the two
dragons when we sat on the banks of the drained pool. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[40](#fn_39.md)  But you, dear sister, go home to see the
king dying and bid Taliesin come, as I wish to talk over many things
with him; for he has recently come from the land of Brittany where he
learned sweet philosophy of Gildas the Wise.” <span
id="fr_41"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)

 

Ganieda returned home and found that Taliesin had returned and the
prince was dead and the servants were sad.  She fell down lamenting
among her friends and tore her hair and cried, “Women, lament with me
the death of Rhydderch and weep for a man such as our earth has not
produced hitherto in our age so far as we know.  He was a lover of
peace, for he so ruled a fierce people that no violence was done to any
one by any one else.  He treated the holy priest with just
moderation <span id="fr_42"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) and permitted the
highest and the lowest to be governed by law.  He was generous, for he
gave away much and kept scarcely anything.  He was all things to all
men, doing whatever was seemly; flower of knights, glory of kings,
pillar of the kingdom.  Woe is me! for what you were - now so
unexpectedly you have become food for worms, and your body moulders in
the urn.  Is this the bed prepared for you after fine silks?  Is it true
that your white flesh and royal limbs will be covered by a cold stone,
that you will be nothing but dust and bones?  So it is, for the
miserable lot of mankind goes on throughout the years so that they
cannot be brought back to their former estate.  Therefore there is no
profit in the bravery of the transient world that flees and returns,
deceives and injures the mighty.  The bee anoints with its honey what it
afterwards stings.  So also those whom the glory of the world caresses
as it departs it deceives and smites with with its disagreeable sting. 
That which excels is of brief duration, what it has does not endure;
like running water everything that is of service passes away.  What is a
rose if it blushes, a snowy lily if it blooms, a man or a horse or
anything else if it is fair!  These things should be referred to the
Creator, not to the world.  Happy therefore are those who remain firm in
a pious heart and serve God and renounce the world.  To them Christ who
reigns without end, the Creator of all things, shall grant to enjoy
perpetual honour.  Therefore I leave you, ye nobles, ye lofty walls,
household gods, sweet sons, and all the things of the world.  In company
with my brother I shall dwell in the woods and shall worship God with a
joyful heart, clothed in a black mantle.”  So she spoke, giving her
husband his due, and she inscribed on his tomb this verse, “Rhydderch
the Generous, than whom there was no one more generous in the world, a
great man rests in this small urn.” <span
id="fr_43"></span>[42bis](#fn_42.md)

 

Meanwhile Taliesin had come to see Merlin the prophet who had sent for
him to find out what wind or rain storm was coming up, for both together
were drawing near and the clouds were thickening.  He drew the following
illustrations under the guidance of Minerva his associate.

 

“Out of nothing the Creator of the world produced four \[elements\] that
they might be the prior cause as well as the material for creating all
things when they were joined together in harmony: <span
id="fr_44"></span>[43](#fn_43.md) the heaven which He adorned with stars
and which stands on high and embraces everything like the shell
surrounding a nut; then He made the air, fir for forming sounds, through
the medium of which day and night present the stars; the sea which girds
the land in four circles, and with its mighty refluence so strikes the
air as to generate the winds which are said to be four in number; as a
foundation He placed the earth, standing by its own strength and not
lightly moved, which is divided into five parts, whereof the middle one
is not habitable because of the heat and the two furthest are shunned
because of their cold.  To the last two He gave moderate temperature and
these are inhabited by men and birds and herds of wild beasts.  He added
clouds to the sky so that they might furnish sudden showers to make the
fruits of the trees and of the ground grow with their gentle
sprinkling.  With the help of the sun these are filled like water skins
from the rivers by a hidden law, and then, rising through the upper air,
they pour out the water they have taken up, driven by the force of the
winds.  From them come rain storms, snow, and round hail when the cold
damp wind breathes out its blasts which, penetrating the clouds, drive
out the streams just as they make them.  Each of the winds takes to
itself a nature of its own from its proximity to the zone where it is
born.  Beyond the firmament in which He fixed the shining stars He
placed the ethereal heaven and gave it as a habitation to troops of
angels whom the worthy contemplation and marvellous sweetness of God
refresh throughout the ages.  This also He adorned with stars and the
shining sun, laying down the law by which the star should run within
fixed limits through the part of heaven entrusted to it.  He afterwards
placed beneath this the airy heavens, shining with the lunar body, which
throughout their high places abound in troops of spirits who sympathize
or rejoice with us as things go well or ill.  They are accustomed to
carry the prayers of men through the air and to beseech God to have
mercy on them, and to bring back intimations of God’s will, either in
dreams or by voice or by other signs, through doing which they become
wise.  The space beyond the moon abounds in evil demons, who are skilled
to cheat and deceive and tempt us; often they assume a body made of air
and appear to us and many things often follow.  They even hold
intercourse with women and make them pregnant, generating in an unholy
manner. <span id="fr_45"></span>[44](#fn_44.md)  So therefore He made the
heavens to be inhabited by three orders of spirits that each one might
look out for something and renew the world from the renewed seed of
things.

 

The sea too He distinguished by various forms that from itself it might
produce the forms of things, generating throughout the ages.  Indeed,
part of it burns and part freezes and the third part, getting a moderate
temperature from the other two, ministers to our needs.  That part which
burns surrounds a gulf and fierce people, and its divers streams,
flowing back, separate this from the orb of the earth, increasing fire
from fire.  Thither descend those who transgress the laws and reject
God; whither their perverse will leads them they go, eager to destroy
what is forbidden to them.  There stands the stern eyed judge holding
his equal balance and giving to each one his merits and his deserts. 
The second part, which freezes, rolls about the foreshore sands which it
is the first to generate from the near-by vapour when it is mingled with
the ray of Venus’ star.  This star, the Arabs say, makes shining gems
when it passes through Pisces \[the fishes\] while its waters look back
at the flames.  These gems by their virtues benefit the people who wear
them, and make many well and keep them so.  These too the Maker
distinguished by their kinds (as He did all things), that we might
discern from their forms and from their colours of what kinds they are
and of what manifest virtues.  The third form of the sea which circles
our orb furnishes us many good things owing to its proximity.  For it
nourishes fishes and produces salt in abundance, and bears back and
forth ships carrying our commerce, by the profits of which the poor man
becomes suddenly rich.  It makes fertile the neighbouring soil and feeds
the birds who, they say, are generated from it along with the fishes
and, although unlike, are moved by the laws of nature.  The sea is
dominated by them more than by the fishes, and they fly lightly up from
it through space and seek the lofty regions.  But its moisture drives
the fishes beneath the waves and keeps them there, and does not permit
them to live when they get out into the dry light.  These too the Maker
distinguished according to their species and to the different ones gave
each his nature, whence through the ages they were to become admirable
and healthful to the sick.

 

For men say that the barbel restrains the heat of passion but makes
blind those who eat it often. <span id="fr_46"></span>[45](#fn_45.md)  The
thymallus, which has its name from the flower thyme, smells so that it
betrays the fish that often eats of it until all the fishes in the river
smell like itself.  They say the the muraenas, contrary to all laws, are
all of the feminine sex, yet they copulate and reproduce and multiply
their offspring from a different kind of seed.  For often snakes come
together along the shore where they are, and they make the sound of
pleasing hissing and, calling out the muraenas, join with them according
to custom.  It is also remarkable that the remora, half a foot long,
holds fast the ship to which it adheres at sea just as though it were
fast aground, and does not permit the vessel to move until it lets go;
because of this power it is to be feared.  And that which they call the
swordfish because it does injury with its sharp beak, people often fear
to approach with a ship when it is swimming, for if it is captured it at
once makes a hole in the vessel, cuts it in pieces, and sinks it
suddenly in a whirlpool.  The serra makes itself feared by ships because
of its crest; it fixes to them as it swims underneath, cuts them to
pieces and throws the pieces into the waves, wherefore its crest is to
be feared like a sword.  And the water dragon, which men say has poison
under its wings, is to be feared by those who capture it; whenever it
strikes it does harm by pouring out its poison.  The torpedo is said to
have another kind of destruction, for if any one touches it when it is
alive, straightway his arms and his feet grow torpid and so do his other
members and they lose their functions just as though they were dead, so
harmful is the emanation of its body.

 

To those and other fishes God gave the sea, and He added to it many
realms among the waves, which men inhabit and which are renowned because
of the fertility which the earth produces there from its fruitful soil. 
Of these Britain is said to be the foremost and best, producing in its
fruitfulness every single thing.  For it bears crops which throughout
the year give the noble gifts of fragrance for the use of man, and it
has woods and glades with honey dripping in them, and lofty mountains
and broad green fields, fountains and rivers, fishes and cattle and wild
beasts, fruit trees, gems, precious metals, and whatever creative nature
is in the habit of furnishing.  Besides all these it has fountains
healthful because of their hot waters which nourish the sick and provide
pleasing baths, which quickly send people away cured with their sickness
driven out.  So Bladud established them when he held the sceptre of the
kingdom, <span id="fr_47"></span>[46](#fn_46.md) and he gave them the name
of his consort Alaron.  These are of value to many sick because of the
healing of their water, but most of all to women, as often the water has
demonstrated.  Near to this island lies Thanet which abounds in many
things but lacks the death-dealing serpent, and if any of its earth is
drunk mixed with wine it takes away poison. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[47](#fn_47.md)  Our ocean also divides the Orkneys from
us.  These are divided into thirty three islands by the sundering flood;
twenty lack cultivation and the others are cultivated.  Thule receives
its name “furthest” from the sun, because of the solstice which the
summer sun makes there, turning its rays and shining no further, and
taking away the day, so that always throughout the long night the air is
full of shadows, and making a bridge congealed by the benumbing cold,
which prevents the passage of ships.

 

The most outstanding island after our own is said to be Ireland with its
happy fertility.  It is larger and produces no bees, and no birds except
rarely, and it does not permit snakes to breed in it.  Whence it happens
that if earth or a stone is carried away from there and added to any
other place it drives away snakes and bees.  The island of Gades lies
next to Herculean Gades, and there grows there a tree from whose bark a
gum drips out of which gems are made, breaking all laws.  The Hesperides
are said to contain a watchful dragon who, men say, guards the golden
apples under the leaves.  The Gorgades are inhabited by women with
goats’ bodies who are said to surpass hares in the swiftness of their
running.  Argyre and Chryse bear, it is said, gold and silver just as
Corinth does common stones.  Sri Lanka blooms pleasantly because of its
fruitful soil, for it produces two crops in a single year; twice it is
summer, twice spring, twice men gather grapes and other fruits, and it
is also most pleasing because of its shining gems.  Tiles produces
flowers and fruits in an eternal spring, green throughout the seasons.

 

The island of apples which men call “The Fortunate Isle” gets its name
from the fact that it produces all things of itself; the fields there
have no need of the ploughs of the farmers and all cultivation is
lacking except what nature provides.  Of its own accord it produces
grain and grapes, and apple trees grow in its woods from the
close-clipped grass.  The ground of its own accord produces everything
instead of merely grass, and people live there a hundred years or more. 
There nine sisters rule by a pleasing set of laws those who come to them
from our country. <span id="fr_49"></span>[48](#fn_48.md)  She who is first
of them is more skilled in the healing art, and excels her sisters in
the beauty of her person.  Morgen is her name, and she has learned what
useful properties all the herbs contain, so that she can cure sick
bodies.  She also knows an art by which to change her shape, and to
cleave the air on new wings like Daedalus; when she wishes she is at
Brest, Chartres, or Pavia, <span id="fr_50"></span>[49](#fn_49.md)and when
she will she slips down from the air onto your shores.  And men say that
she has taught mathematics to her sisters, Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten,
Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thitis; Thitis best known for her cither. 
Thither after the battle of Camlan we took the wounded Arthur, guided by
Barinthus <span id="fr_51"></span>[50](#fn_50.md) to whom the waters and
the stars of heaven were well known.  With him steering the ship we
arrived there with the prince, and Morgen received is with fitting
honour, and in her chamber she placed the king on a golden bed and with
er own hand she uncovered his honourable wound and gazed at it for a
long time.  At length she said that health could be restored to him if
he stayed with her for a long time and made use of her healing art. 
Rejoicing, therefore, we entrusted the king to her and returning spread
our sails to the favouring winds.”

 

Merlin said in answer, “Dear friend, since that time how much the
kingdom has endured from the violated oath, so that what it once was it
no longer is!  For by an evil fate the nobles are roused up and turned
against each other’s vitals, and they upset everything so that the
abundance of riches has fled from the country and all goodness has
departed, and the desolated citizens leave their walls empty.  Upon them
shall come the Saxon people, fierce in war, who shall again cruelly
overthrow us and our cities, and shall violate God’s law and his
temples.  For He shall certainly permit this destruction to come upon us
because of our crimes that He may correct the foolish.”  Merlin had
scarcely finished when Taliesin exclaimed, “Then the people should send
some one to tell the chief to come back in a swift ship if has recovered
his strength, that he may drive off the enemy with his accustomed vigour
and re-establish the citizens in their former peace.”

 

“No,” said Merlin, “not thus shall this people depart when once they
have fixed their claws on our shores.  For at first they shall enslave
our kingdom and our people and our cities, and shall dominate them with
their forces for many years.  Nevertheless three <span
id="fr_52"></span>[51](#fn_51.md) from among our people shall resist with
much courage and shall kill many, and in the end shall overcome them. 
But they shall not continue thus, for it is the will of the highest
Judge that the Britons shall through weakness lose their noble kingdom
for a long time, until Conan <span id="fr_53"></span>[52](#fn_52.md) shall
come in his chariot from Brittany, and Cadwalader the venerated leader
of the Welsh, who shall join together Scots and Cumbrians, Cornishmen
and men of Brittany in a firm league, and shall return to their people
their lost crown, expelling the enemy and renewing the times of Brutus,
and shall deal with the cities in accordance with their consecrated
laws.  And the kings shall begin again to conquer remote peoples and to
subjugate their own realms to themselves in mighty conflict.”  “No one
shall then be alive of those who are now living,” said Taliesin, “nor do
I think that any one has seen so many savage battles between fellow
citizens as you have.”  “That is so,” said Merlin, “for I have lived a
long time, seeing many of them, both of our own people among themselves
and of the barbarians who disturb everything.

 

“And I remember the crime when Constans was betrayed and the small
brothers Uther and Ambrosius fled across the water. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[53](#fn_53.md)  At once wars began in the kingdom which
now lacked a leader, for Vortigern of Gwent, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[54](#fn_54.md) the consul, was leading his troops
against all the nations so that he might have the leadership of them,
and was inflicting a wretched death upon the harmless peasants.  At
length with sudden violence he seized the crown after putting to death
many of the nobles and he subdued the whole kingdom to himself.  But
those who were allied to the brothers by blood relationship, offended at
this, began to set fire to all the cities of the ill-fated prince and to
perturb his kingdom with savage soldiery, and they would not permit him
to possess it in peace.  Disquieted therefore since he could not
withstand the rebellious people, he prepared to invite to the war men
from far away with whose aid he might be able to meet his enemies.  Soon
there came from divers parts of the world warlike bands whom he received
with honour.  The Saxon people, in fact, arriving in their curved keels
had come to serve him with their helmeted soldiery.  They were led by
two courageous brothers, Horsus and Hengist, who afterwards with wicked
treachery harmed the people and the cities.  For after this, by serving
the king with industry, they won him over to themselves and seeing the
people moved by a quarrel that touched them closely they were able to
subjugate the king; then turning their ferocious arms upon the people
they broke faith and killed the princes by a premeditated fraud while
they were sitting with them after calling them together to make peace
and a treaty with them, and the prince they drove over the top of the
snowy mountain.  These are the things I had begun to prophesy to him
would happen to the kingdom.  Next roaming abroad they set fire to the
houses of the nation, and strove to make everything subject to
themselves.  But when Vortimer saw how great was the peril of his
country, and saw his father expelled from the hall of Brutus, he took
the crown, with the assent of the people, and attacked the savage tribes
that were crushing them, and by many battles forced these to return to
Thanet where the fleet was that had brought them.  But in their flight
fell the warrior Horsus and many others, slain by our men.  The king
followed them and, taking his stand before Thanet besieged it by land
and sea, but without success, for the enemy suddenly got possession of
their fleet and with violence broke out and, led over the sea, they
regained their own country in haste.  Therefore, since he had conquered
the enemy in victorious war, Vortimer became a ruler to be respected in
the world, and he treated his kingdom with just restraint.  But
Hengist’s sister, Rowena, <span id="fr_56"></span>[55](#fn_55.md) seeing
with indignation these successes, and protected by deceit, mixed poison,
becoming on her brother’s account a malignant step-mother, and she gave
it to Vortimer to drink, and killed him by the draught.  At once she
sent across the water to her brother to tell him to come back with so
many and such great multitudes that he would be able to conquer the
warlike natives.  This therefore he did, for he came with such force
against our army that he took booty from everybody until he was loaded
with it, and he thoroughly destroyed by fire the houses throughout the
country.

 

“While these things were happening Uther and Ambrosius were in Breton
territory with King Biducus and they had already girded on their swords
and were proved fit for war, and had associated with themselves troops
from all directions so that they might seek their native land and put to
flight the people who were busy wasting their patrimony.  So they gave
their boats to the wind and the sea, and landed for the protection of
their subjects; they drove Vortigern through the regions of Wales and
shut him up in his tower and burned both him and it.  Then they turned
their swords upon the Angles and many times when they met them they
defeated them, and on the other hand they were often defeated by them. 
At length in a hand to hand conflict our men with great effort attacked
the enemy and defeated them decisively, and killed Hengist, and by the
will of Christ triumphed.

 

“After these things had been done, the kingdom and its crown were with
the approval of clergy and laity given to Ambrosius, and he ruled justly
in all things, but after the space of four \[sixteen\] years had elapsed
he was betrayed by his doctor, and died from drinking poison.  His
younger brother Uther succeeded him, and at first was unable to maintain
his kingdom in peace, for the perfidious people, accustomed by now to
return, came and laid waste everything with their usual phalanx.  Uther
fought them in savage battles and drove them conquered across the water
with returning oars.  Soon he put aside strife and re-established peace
and begat a son who afterwards was so eminent that he was second to none
in uprightness.  Arthur was his name and he held the kingdom for many
years after the death of his father Uther, and this he did with great
grief and labour, and with the slaughter of many men in many wars.  For
while the aforesaid chief lay ill, from Anglia came a faithless people
who with sword subdued all the country and the regions across the
Humber.  Arthur was a boy and on account of his youth he was not able to
defeat such a force.  Therefore after seeking the advice of clergy and
laity he sent to Hoel, king of Brittany, and asked him to come to his
aid with a swift fleet, for they were united by ties of blood and
friendship, so that each was bound to relieve the distresses of the
other.  Hoel therefore quickly collected for the war fierce men from
every side and came to us with many thousands, and joining with Arthur
he attacked the enemy often, and drove them back and made terrible
slaughter.  With his help Arthur was secure and strong among all the
troops when he attacked the enemy whom at length he conquered and forced
to return to their own country, and he quieted his own kingdom by the
moderation of his laws.

 

“Soon after this struggle he changed the scene of the war, and subdued
the Scots and Irish and all these warlike countries by means of the
forces he had brought.  He also subjugated the Norwegians far away
across the broad seas, and the Danes whom he had visited with his hated
fleet.  He conquered the people of the Gauls after killing Frollo to
whom the Roman power had given the care of that country; the Romans,
too, who were seeking to make war on his country, he fought against and
conquered, and killed the Procurator Hiberius Lucius <span
id="fr_57"></span>[56](#fn_56.md) who was then a colleague of Legnis the
general, and who by the command of the Senate had come to bring the
territories of the Gauls under their power.  Meanwhile the faithless and
foolish custodian Modred had commenced to subdue our kingdom to himself,
and was making unlawful love to the king’s wife.  For the king,
desiring, as men say, to go across the water to attack the enemy, had
entrusted the queen and the kingdom to him.  But when the report of such
a great evil came to his ears, he put aside his interest in the wars
and, returning home, landed with many thousand men and fought with his
nephew and drove him flying across the water.  There the traitor, after
collecting Saxons from all sides, began to battle with his lord, but he
fell, betrayed by the unholy people confiding in whom he had undertaken
such big things.  How great was the slaughter of men and the grief of
women whose sons fell in that battle!  After it the king, mortally
wounded, left his kingdom and, sailing across the water with you as you
have related, came to the court of the maidens.  Each of the two sons of
Modred, desiring to conquer the kingdom for himself, began to wage war
and each in turn slew those who were near of kin to him.  Then Duke
Constantine, nephew of the king, rose up fiercely against them and
ravaged the people and the cities, and after having killed both of them
by a cruel death ruled over the people and assumed the crown.  But he
did not continue in peace since Conan his relative waged dire war on him
and ravaged everything and killed the king and seized for himself those
lands which he now governs weakly and without a plan.”

 

While he was speaking thus the servants hurried in and announced to him
that a new fountain had broken out at the foot of the mountains and was
pouring out pure waters which were running through all the hollow valley
and swirling through the fields as they slipped along.  Both therefore
quickly rose to see the new fountain, and having seen it Merlin sat down
again on the grass and praised the spot and the flowing waters, and
marvelled that they had come out of the ground in such a fashion.  Soon
afterward, becoming thirsty, he leaned down to the stream and drank
freely and bathed his temples in its waves, so that the water passed
through the passages of bowels and stomach, settling the vapours within
him, and at once he regained his reason and knew himself, and all his
madness departed and the sense which had long remained torpid in him
revived, and he remained what he had once been - sane and intact with
his reason restored. <span id="fr_58"></span>[57](#fn_57.md)  Therefore,
praising God, he turned his face toward the stars and uttered devout
words of praise.  “O King, through whom the machine of the starry
heavens exists, through whom the sea and the land with its pleasing
grass give forth and nourish their offspring and with their profuse
fertility give frequent aid to mankind, through whom sense has returned
and the error of my mind has vanished!  I was carried away from myself
and like a spirit I knew the acts of past peoples and predicted the
future.  Then since I knew the secrets of things and the flight of birds
and the wandering motions of the stars and the gliding of the fishes,
all this vexed me and denied a natural rest to my human mind by a severe
law.  Now I have come to myself and I seem to be moved with a vigour
such as was wont to animate my limbs.  Therefore, highest Father, ought
I to be obedient to Thee, that I may show forth Thy most worthy praise
from a worthy heart, always joyfully making joyful offerings.  For twice
Thy generous hand has benefited me alone, in giving me the gift of this
new fountain out of the green grass.  For now I have the water which
hitherto I lacked, and by drinking of it my brains have been made
whole.  But whence comes this virtue, O dear companion, that this new
fountain breaks out thus, and makes me myself again who up to now was as
though insane and beside myself?”

 

Taliesin answered, “The opulent Regulator of things divided the rivers
according to their kinds, and added moreover to each a power of its own,
that they might often prove of benefit to the sick. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[58](#fn_58.md)  For there are fountains and rivers and
lakes throughout the world which by their power cure many, and often do
so.  At Rome, for instance, flows swift Albula, with its health-giving
stream which men say cures wounds with its sure healing.  There is
another fountain, called Cicero’s, which flows in Italy, which cures the
eyes of all injuries.  The Ethiopians also are said to have a pool which
makes a face on which it is poured shine just as though from oil. 
Africa has a fountain, commonly called Zama, a drink from it produces
melodious voices by its sudden power.  Lake Clitorius in Italy gives a
distaste for wine; those who drink from the fountain of Chios are said
to become dull.  The land of Boeotia is said to have two fountains; the
one makes the drinker forgetful, the other makes them remember.  The
same country contains a lake so harmful with its dire plague that it
generates madness and the heat of too much passion.  The fountain of
Cyzicus drives away lust and the love of Venus.  In the region of
Campania there flow, it is said, rivers which when drunk of make the
barren fruitful, and the same ones are said to take away madness from
men.  The land of the Ethiopians contains a fountain with a red stream;
whoever drinks of this will come back demented.  The fountain of Leinus
never permits miscarriages.  There are two fountains in Sicily, one of
which makes girls sterile and the other makes them fruitful by its
kindly law.  There are two rivers in Thessaly of the greatest power; a
sheep drinking of one turns black and is made white by the other, and
any one drinking of both spends its life with a variegated fleece. 
There is a lake called Clitumnus in the Umbrian land which is said at
times to produce large oxen, and in the Reatine Swamp the hooves of
horses become hard as soon as they cross its sands.  In the Asphalt Lake
of Judaea bodies can never sink while life animates them, but on the
other hand the land of India has a pool called Sida in which nothing
floats but sinks at once to the bottom.  And there is a Lake Aloe in
which nothing sinks but all things float even if they are pieces of
lead.  The fountain of Marsida also compels stones to float.  The River
Styx flows from a rock and kills those who drink of it; the land of
Arcadia bears testimony to this form of destruction.  The fountain of
Idumea, changing four times throughout the days, is said to vary its
colour by a strange rule; for it becomes muddy, then green, then the
order changes and it turns red and then becomes clear with a beautiful
stream.  It is said to retain each of these colours for three months as
the years roll around.  There is also a Lake Trogdytus whose waves flow
out, three times in the day bitter, and three times sweet with a
pleasant taste.  From a fountain of Epirus torches are said to be
lighted, and if extinguished to resume their light again.  The fountain
of the Garamantes is said to be so cold in the day time, and on the
other hand so hot all night, that it forbids approach on account of its
cold or its heat.  There are also hot waters that threaten many because
of the heat which they get when they flow through alum or sulphur which
have a fiery power, pleasant for healing.  God endowed the rivers with
these powers and others so that they might be the means of quick healing
for the sick, and so that they might make manifest with what power the
Creator stands eminent among things while He works thus in them.  I
think that these waters are healthful in the highest degree and I think
that they could afford a quick cure through the water that has thus
broken out.  They have up to now been flowing about through the dark
hollows under the earth like many others that are said to trickle
underground.  Perhaps their breaking out is due to an obstacle getting
in their way, or to the slipping of a stone or a mass of earth.  I think
that, in making their way back again, they have gradually penetrated the
ground and have given us this fountain.  You see many such flow along
and return again underground and regain their caverns.”

 

While they were doing these things a rumour ran all about that a new
fountain had broken out in the woods of Calidon, and that drinking from
it had cured a man who had for a long time been suffering from madness
and had lived in these same woods after the manner of the wild beasts. 
Soon therefore the princes and the chieftains came to see it and to
rejoice with the prophet who had been cured by the water.  After they
had informed him in detail of the status of his country and had asked
him to resume his sceptre, and to deal with his people with his
accustomed moderation, he said, “Young men, my time of life, drawing on
toward old age, and so possessing my limbs that with my weakened vigour
I can scarce pass through the fields, does not ask this of me.  I have
already lived long enough, rejoicing in happy days while an abundance of
great riches smiled profusely upon me.  In that wood there stands an oak
in its hoary strength which old age, that consumes everything, has so
wasted away that it lacks sap and is decaying inwardly. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[58bis](#fn_59.md)  I saw this when it first began to
grow and I even saw the fall of the acorn from which it came, and a
woodpecker standing over it and watching the branch.  Here I have seen
it grow of its won accord, watching it all, and, fearing for it in these
fields, I marked the spot with my retentive mind.  So you see I have
lived a long time and now the weight of age holds me back and I refuse
to reign again.  When I remain under the green leaves the riches of
Calidon delight me more than the gems that India produces, or the gold
that Tagus is aid to have on its shore, more than the crops of Sicily or
the grapes of pleasant Methis, more than lofty turrets or cities girded
with high walls or robes fragrant with Tyrian perfumes.  Nothing pleases
me enough to tear me away from my Calidon which in my opinion is always
pleasant.  Here shall I remain while I live, content with apples and
grasses, and I shall purify my body with pious fastings that I may be
worthy to partake of the life everlasting.”

 

While he was speaking thus, the chiefs caught sight of long lines of
cranes in the air, circling through space in a curved line in the shape
of certain letters; they could be seen in marshalled squadron in the
limpid air.  Marvelling at these they asked Merlin to tell why it was
that they were flying in such manner.  Merlin presently said to them,
“The Creator of the world gave to the birds as to many other things
their proper nature, as I have learned by living in the woods for many
days.

 

“It is therefore the nature of the cranes, <span
id="fr_61"></span>[59](#fn_60.md) as they go through the air, if many are
present, that we often see them in their flight form a figure in one way
or another.  One, by calling, warns them to keep the formation as they
fly, lest it break up and depart from the usual figure; when he becomes
hoarse another takes his place.  They post sentries at night and the
watchman holds a pebble in his claws when he wishes to drive away sleep,
and when they see any one they start up with a sudden clamour.  The
feathers of all of them grow black as they grow older.  But the eagles,
who get their name from the sharpness of their sight, are said to be of
such keen vision, beyond all others, that they are able to gaze at the
sun without flinching.  They hang up their young in its rays wishing to
know by his avoidance of them whether their exists among them one of
inferior breeding.  They remain on their wings over waters as high as
the top of a mountain and they spy their prey in the lowest depths;
straightway they descend rapidly through the void and seize the fish
swimming as their inheritance demands.  The vulture, thinking little of
the commerce of the sexes, often conceives and bears (strange to say)
without any seed of her spouse.  Flying about on high in the manner of
the eagle she scents with distended nostrils a dead body far across the
water.  This she has no horror of approaching in her flight, although
she is slow, so that she may satiate herself with the prey she wishes
for.  This same bird also lives vigorous for a hundred years.  The stork
with its croaking voice is a messenger of spring; it is said to nourish
its young so carefully that it takes out its own feathers and denudes
its own breast.  When winter comes men say it avoids the storms and
approaches the shores of Asia, led by a crow.  Its young feed it as it
grows old because it fed them when it owed them this care.  The swan, a
bird most pleasing to sailors, excels all others in the sweetness of its
music when it dies.  Men say that in the country of the Hyperboreans it
comes up close by being attracted by the sound of a zither played loudly
along the shore.  The ostrich deserts her eggs which she places under
the dust that they may be taken care of there when she herself neglects
them.  Thence the birds come into the world hatched by the sun instead
of their mother.  The heron, when it fears the rain and the tempests,
flies to the clouds to avoid such a peril; hence sailors say that it
portends sudden rainstorms when they see it high up in the air.  The
phoenix by divine dispensation always lives as an unique bird, and in
the land of the Arabs rises with a renewed body.  When it grows old it
goes to a place very warm from the heat of the sun and gets together a
great heap of spices and builds itself a pyre, which it lights with
rapid movements of its wings, and it settles down upon this and is
completely consumed.  The ashes of its body produce a bird, and in this
way the phoenix is again renewed throughout the ages.  The cinnamolgus
when it wishes to build a nest brings cinnamon, and builds of that
because of its undoubted strength.  From this men are in the habit of
driving it away with arrows, after which they remove the heap and sell
it.  The halcyon is a bird that frequents sea pools and builds its nest
in time of winter; when it broods the seas are calm for seven days and
the winds cease and the tempests, relaxed, hold off, furnishing placid
quiet for the bird.  The parrot is thought to utter human speech as its
own call when no one is looking directly at it, and it mixes “ave” and
“chaire” with jocose words.  The pelican is a bird accustomed to kill
its young and to lament for three days confused with grief.  Then it
tears its own body with its beak and, cutting the veins, lets out
streams of blood with which it sprinkles the birds and brings them back
to life.  The Diomedae when they resound with tearful noise and make
lament are said to portend the sudden death of kings or a great peril to
the realm.  And when they see anyone they know at once what he is,
whether barbarian or Greek; for they approach a Greek with beatings of
the wings and with caresses and they make a joyful noise but they fly
about the others on hostile wings and approach them with a horrible
sound as though they were enemies.  The Memnonides are said to go on a
long flight every fifth year to the tomb of Memnon, and to lament the
prince killed in the Trojan war.  The shining Hercynia has a marvellous
feather which gleams on a dark night like a lighted lamp, and shows the
way if it is carried in front of a traveller.  When the woodpecker makes
a nest he pulls out of the tree nails and wedges that no one else can
get out and the whole neighbourhood resounds with his blows.”

 

After he had finished speaking a certain madman came to them, either by
accident or led there by fate; <span id="fr_62"></span>[60](#fn_61.md) he
filled the grove and the air with a terrific clamour and like a wild
boar he foamed at the mouth and threatened to attack them.  They quickly
captured him and made him sit down by them that his remarks might move
them to laughter and jokes.  When the prophet looked at him more
attentively he recollected who he was and groaned from the bottom of his
heart, saying, “This is not the way he used to look when we were in the
bloom of our youth, for at that time he was a fair, strong knight and
one distinguished by his nobility and his royal race.  Him and many
others I had with me in the days of my wealth, and I was thought
fortunate in having so many good companions, and I was.  It happened one
time while we were hunting in the lofty mountains of Arwystli <span
id="fr_63"></span>[61](#fn_62.md) that we came to an oak which rose in the
air with its broad branches.  A fountain flowed there, surrounded on all
sides by green grass, whose waters were suitable for human consumption;
we were all thirsty and we sat down by it and drank greedily of its pure
waters.  Then we saw some fragrant apples lying on the tender grass of
the familiar bank of the fountain.  The man who saw them first quickly
gathered them up and gave them to me, laughing at the unexpected gift. 
I distributed to my companions the apples he had given to me, and I went
without any because the pile was not big enough.  The others to whom the
apples had been given laughed and called me generous, and eagerly
attacked and devoured them and complained because there were so few of
them.  Without any delay a miserable sadness seized this man and all the
others; they quickly lost their reason and like dogs bit and tore each
other, and foamed at the mouth and rolled on the ground in a demented
state.  Finally, they went away like wolves filling the vacant air with
howlings.  These apples I thought were intended for me and not for them,
and later I found out that they were.  At that time there was in that
district a woman who had formerly been infatuated with me, and had
satisfied her love for me during many years.  After I had spurned her
and had refused to cohabit with her she was suddenly seized with an evil
desire to do me harm, and when with all her plotting she could not find
any means of approach, she placed the gifts smeared with poison by the
fountain to which I was going to return, planning by this device to
injure me if I should chance to find the apples on the grass and eat
them.  But my good fortune kept me from them, as I have just said.  I
pray you, make this man drink of the healthful waters of this new
fountain so that, if by chance he get back his health, he may know
himself and may, while his life lasts, labour with me in these glades in
service to God.”  This, therefore, the leaders did, and the man who had
come there raging drank the water, recovered, and, cured at once
recognized his friends.

 

Then Merlin said, “You must now go on in the service of God who restored
you as you now see yourself, you who for so many years lived in the
desert like a wild beast, going about without a sense of shame.  Now
that you have recovered your reason, do not shun the bushes or the green
glades which you inhabited while you were mad, but stay with me that you
may strive to make up in service to God for the days that the force of
madness took from you.  From now on all things shall be in common
between you and me in this service so long as either lives.”  At this
Maeldinus (for that was the man’s name) said, “Reverend father, I do not
refuse to do this, for I shall joyfully stay in the woods with you, and
shall worship God with my whole mind, while that spirit, for which I
shall render thanks to your ministry, governs my trembling limbs.”  “And
I shall make a third with you, and shall despise the things of the
world,” said Taliesin.  “I have spent enough time living in vain, and
now is the time to restore me to myself under your leadership.  But you,
lords, go away and defend your cities; it is not fitting that you should
disturb beyond measure our quiet with your talk.  You have applauded my
friend enough.”

 

The chiefs went away, and the three remained, with Ganieda, the
prophet’s sister, making a fourth, she who at length had assumed and was
leading a seemly life after the death of the king who so recently had
ruled so many people by the laws he administered.  Now with her brother
there was nothing more pleasant to her than the woods.  She too was at
times elevated by the spirit so that she often prophesied to her friends
concerning the future of the kingdom.  Thus on a certain day when she
stood in her brother’s hall and saw the windows of the house shining
with the sun she uttered these doubtful words from her doubtful breast.

 

“I see the city of Oxford filled with helmed men, <span
id="fr_64"></span>[62](#fn_63.md) and the holy men and the holy bishops
bound in fetters by the advice of the Council, and men shall admire the
shepherd’s tower reared on high, and he shall be forced to open it to no
purpose and to his own injury.  I see Lincoln <span
id="fr_65"></span>[63](#fn_64.md) walled in by savage soldiery and two men
shut up in it, one of whom escapes to return with a savage tribe and
their chief to the walls to conquer the cruel soldiers after capturing
their leader.  O what a shame it is that the stars should capture the
sun, under whom they sink down, compelled neither by force nor by war! 
I see two moons in the air near Winchester <span
id="fr_66"></span>[64](#fn_65.md) and two lions acting with too great
ferocity, and one man looking at two and another at the same number, and
preparing for battle and standing opposed.  The others rise up and
attack the fourth fiercely and savagely but not one of them prevails,
for he stands firm and moves his shield and fights back with his weapons
and as victor straightway defeats his triple enemy.  Two of them he
drives across the frozen regions of the north while he gives to the
third the mercy that he asks, so that the stars flee through all
portions of the fields.  The Boar of Brittany, protected by an aged oak,
takes away the moon, brandishing swords behind her back.  I see two
stars engaging in combat with wild beasts beneath the hill of Urien
where the people of Gwent and those of Deira met in the reign of the
great Coel. <span id="fr_67"></span>[65](#fn_66.md)  O with what sweat the
men drip and with what blood the ground while wounds are being given to
the foreigners!  One star collides with the other and falls into the
shadow, hiding its light from the renewed light.  Alas what dire famine
shall come, so that the north shall inflame her vitals and empty them of
the strength of her people.  It begins with the Welsh and goes through
the chief parts of the kingdom, and forces the wretched people to cross
the water.  The calves accustomed to live on the milk of the Scottish
cows that are dying from the pestilence shall flee.  Normans depart and
cease to bear weapons through our native realm with your cruel
soldiery.  There is nothing left with which to feed your greed for you
have consumed everything that creative nature has produced in her happy
fertility.  Christ, aid thy people! restrain the lions and give to the
country quiet peace and the cessation of wars.”  She did not stop with
this and her companions wondered at her, and her brother, who soon came
to her, spoke approvingly with friendly words in this manner, “Sister,
does the spirit wish you to foretell future things, since he has closed
up my mouth and my book?  Therefore this task is given to you; rejoice
in it, and under my favour devoted to him speak everything.”

 

I have brought this song to an end.  Therefore, ye Britons, give a
wreath to Geoffrey of Monmouth.  He is indeed yours for once he sang of
your battles and those of your chiefs, and he wrote a book called “The
Deeds of the Britons” which are celebrated throughout the world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1](vmeng.htm#fr_0) (3.md)  Robert de Chesney,
fourth Bishop of Lincoln, was chosen toward the end of the year 1148
after the death of Bishop Alexander, to whom Geoffrey had dedicated his
version of the prophecies of Merlin.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2](vmeng.htm#fr_1) (14-15.md)  Camerinus, Macer,
Marius, and Rabirius are all referred to within a few lines of one of
Ovid’s *Epistles from Pontus* (IV, xvi).

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3](vmeng.htm#fr_2) (23ff.md)  For this battle and
the persons concerned in it see the Introduction.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[4](vmeng.htm#fr_3) (24-25.md)  This seems like a
reference to the pillaging expedition, which, according to the *Triads*,
was made by Aeddan shortly before the battle of Arderydd.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[5](vmeng.htm#fr_4) (32.md)  The name Cambri
(Cymry), now applied to the Welsh, was formerly used of the Britons of
Strathclyde and Cumberland - “Y Gogledd”.  The kingdom of Rhydderch was
in this region.  Jocelyn of Furness in his *The Life of St Kentigern*
(Chap xxxi) speaks of going “de Wallia ad Cambrian”.  See also *Y
Cymmrodor*, XI, 98.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[6](vmeng.htm#fr_5) (34.md)  The Welsh dialogue
between Myrddin and Taliesin speaks of the death in the battle of,
“Three men of note whose esteem was great with Elgan.”  It speaks also
of the prodigies of valour performed by the seven sons of Eliffer, of
whom Peredur we know was one, and it may be three of these who are
referred to.  See the Miscellany.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7](vmeng.htm#fr_6) (63ff.md)  The madness of
Merlin, hardly intelligible here, is clear enough in the other versions
where it comes as a punishment for his own misdeeds.  For parallels to
this story see the Irish *Frenzy of Suibhne* and the other texts
referred to in the Introduction.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[8](vmeng.htm#fr_7) (87.md)  “Celi Duw” came to be a
very common title of the Deity in Welsh, the “coeli” losing completely
its original meaning and being considered quite equivalent to “God.”

<span id="fn_8"></span>[9](vmeng.htm#fr_8) (90.md)  For references in Welsh
literature to Merlin’s apple trees see the *Afallennau* and the
*Oianau*.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[10](vmeng.htm#fr_9) (132.md)  Coed Celyddon or the
Forest of Calidon originally stretched over the greater part of what is
now southern Scotland.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[11](vmeng.htm#fr_10) (165ff.md)  In the Irish
story of Suibhne his madness is softened in a very similar way by
Loingreachan who played upon the harp and sang to him of his family, and
finally persuaded him to return home.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[12](vmeng.htm#fr_11) (191ff.md)  These lines show
that Geoffrey was familiar with the *Heroides* of Ovid.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[13](vmeng.htm#fr_12) (235.md)  Guilandus is
probably, as San Marte suggests, Wayland Smith.  Urbs Sigenus is the old
Welsh Kaer Sigont (now Caer Seiont), a name perhaps transferred to
Carnarvon from the ruins of the Roman station of Segontium on the hill a
short distance above the present city.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[14](vmeng.htm#fr_13) (254ff.md)  This incident is
contained in an expanded form in a fragment believed to be from a lost
life of Kentigern, printed by Ward in *Romania*, xxii; there however the
story is of Lailoken and the wife of Meldred, king of Dunmeller.  It
bears some resemblance to the story told in Jocelyn’s *The Life of St
Kentigern* of the adultery of Languoreth, wife of Rhydderch.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[15](vmeng.htm#fr_14) (305ff.md)  This resembles
closely another fragment printed by Ward in which Lailoken prophesies a
similar threefold death, in this case, however, for himself.  Much the
same incident has been preserved in by Welsh oral tradition in Glamorgan
in connection with Twm Ieuan ap Rhys (born in 1474), commonly called Twm
Gelwydd Teg or Tom of the Fine Lies.  According to the story printed in
the *Iolo Manuscripts*, (Second edition, p 202, translation p 616)

Twm was one day threshing in a barn, and a young lad went by and
addressed him as follows: “Well, Twm Gelwydd Teg, what news have you
today?”  “There is news for thee,” said he; “thou shalt die three deaths
before this night.”  “Ha! Ha!” said the youth, “nobody can die more than
one death,” and he went off laughing.  In the course of the day, the lad
went to the top of a great tree on the brink of a river, to take a
kite’s nest, and in thrusting his hand into the nest, he was wounded by
an adder, brought by the kite to her young ones, as she was accustomed
to do.  This causing him to lose his hold, he fell down on a great
branch and broke his neck, and from there he fell into the river, and
thus he met with three deaths, to be wounded by an adder, to break his
neck, and to drown.

The relation of such stories as these to similar incidents found earlier
in the romances is a puzzling one, but probably relate to much earlier
tales.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[16](vmeng.htm#fr_15) (434-435.md)  These lines,
backed up by lines 1133-1135, place the action of the poem in the reign
of Aurelius Conan, which according to the *Historia* began about two
years after the translation of Arthur and lasted for about two years. 
As Geoffrey places the translation of Arthur in 542, he has made a
mistake in dating, since the BAttle of Arderydd was fought about 577.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[17](vmeng.htm#fr_16) (451.md)  In the Irish
version of the story Eorann, wife of Suibhne, takes a new mate in much
the same fashion as Guendoloena does here.  In the same story we find
Suibhne speaking of his herd of stags, to one of which he says,

“Thou stag that comest lowing  
to me across the glen,  
pleasant is the place for seats  
on the top of they antler-points.”

<span id="fn_17"></span>[18](vmeng.htm#fr_17) (481-532.md)  These two
incidents are apparently of Oriental origin and quite possibly came to
Geoffrey through some collection of exempla.  In the *Babylonian Talmud*
there is a similar tale in which a daemon laughs at a man buying shoes
and at a fortune-teller prophesying wealth for others.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[19](vmeng.htm#fr_18) (560.md)  In the Irish
version the prophecies are taken down by St Molig; in the Scottish
version by St Kentigern; in the Welsh poems Myrddin makes them to his
sister.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20](vmeng.htm#fr_19) (580ff.md)  The following
passage is a working over of the *Historia*, XI, vii-x.  The “Wolf of
the Sea” refers to Gormund.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21](vmeng.htm#fr_20) (586.md)  The “Boar of
Cornwall” is Geoffrey’s name for Arthur in the *Prophecies*; the
“nephews” are apparently his grand-nephews, the sons of Modred. 
(*Historia*, XI, iii).

<span id="fn_21"></span>[22](vmeng.htm#fr_21) (590.md)  This evidently
refers to Careticus of the *Historia*, the fourth after Arthur’s
successor Constantine.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23](vmeng.htm#fr_22) (596-624.md)  For the greater
part of this there are no specific explanations.  In Jocelyn’s
*Kentigern* we find Lailoken predicting the death of Rhydderch, and in
the Welsh poem of the Cyfoesi we find Myrddin doing the same.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[24](vmeng.htm#fr_23) (599.md)  On the Gewissi, who
are probably intended here, see note 54 below.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[25](vmeng.htm#fr_24) (608.md)  Men whose names are
derived from horses, that one naturally thinks of, are Hengist, Horsus,
and March, but none of these seems to fit here.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[26](vmeng.htm#fr_25) (612.md)  Kaer Alclwyd, the
modern Dumbarton, was destroyed by the Picts in 736, and by the Northmen
in 870.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[27](vmeng.htm#fr_26) (618.md)  Carlisle was
destroyed by the Northmen and restored by William Rufus.  In 1133 Henry
I (the “Lion of Justice” of the *Prophecies*) re-established its
bishopric.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[28](vmeng.htm#fr_27) (614.md)  Lot believes that
this passage was inspired by the sight of the ruins of the old Roman
station of Segontium on the hill above the modern city of Carnarvon.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[29](vmeng.htm#fr_28) (620.md)  The old Roman port,
now Richborough on the Kent coast between Ramsgate and Deal.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[30](vmeng.htm#fr_29) (621.md)  The Rutheni were,
according to Alanus, the people of Flanders.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[31](vmeng.htm#fr_30) (622-623.md)  This may refer
to the passage in the *Historia* (VII, iii), “Menevia shall be robed in
the pall of the City of the Legions,” but I think more probably it
expresses the hope that a king should soon come who would re-establish
(or establish) an archbishop at St David’s, a hope that must have been
cherished by the Welsh even before the time of Giraldus Cambrensis. 
According to Welsh belief this city had been the seat of an archbishop
until the time of Samson, twenty fifth from Dewi or David, who fled to
Dol in Brittany taking the pall with him.  (Giraldus Cambrensis, *De
Menevensi Ecclesia Dialogus*).

<span id="fn_31"></span>[32](vmeng.htm#fr_31) (624.md)  This is the city on
the Usk and not Chester, also called the City of the Legions, as the
reference to the Severn shows.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[33](vmeng.htm#fr_32) (626.md)  San Marte believes
from what follows that this refers to the coming of Augustine.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[34](vmeng.htm#fr_33) (630-631.md)  Clearly the
defeat of Brocmail and the slaughter of the monks at Leicester referred
to in the *Historia* (XI, xiii), although the number does not agree with
the printed texts; it does agree with the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[35](vmeng.htm#fr_34) (632.md)  Athelstan,
according to *Historia*, XII, xix.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[36](vmeng.htm#fr_35) (650-654.md)  Daci was
commonly used for the Danes at this period, as Neustrenses was for the
Normans.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[37](vmeng.htm#fr_36) (652.md)  Possibly Canute and
his son Harold.  San Marte evidently translates this passage
differently, since his not explains that the “Lex Marsia” was used south
of the Thames and the Danish laws north of it.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[38](vmeng.htm#fr_38) (672-680.md)  This refers to
the *Historia*, VII, iii, but its meaning remains unclear.  The “three”
are the two Williams and Henry I, and the “fourth” Stephen.  San Marte
takes the “four” to be William Rufus, Henry I, Stephen, and Henry II,
and the “two” to be Richard and John, the latter of whom he believes to
be the “sixth”, even if line 680 does not fit him.  However, the same
thing occurs in the *Historia*, and although it is not safe to say that
a certain passage is not an interpolation, this passage was probably
written forty years or so before King John was born.  It is possible
that Geoffrey was basing this passage on an old Welsh poem which Skene
believes to have been written before 655.

Five chiefs there will be to me  
Of the Gwyddyl Ffichti  
Of a sinner’s disposition  
Of a race of the knife;  
Five others will there be to me  
Of the Norddmyn place;  
The sixth a wonderful king,  
From the sowing to the reaping;  
The seventh proceeded  
To the land over the flood  
The eighth, of the line of Dyfi,  
Shall not be freed from prosperity.

Skene explains the five kings of the Northumbrians as Ida, Ella,
Ethelric, Ethelfred, and Edwin.  The sixth was Osric who reigned only a
few months, and the seventh was Eanfrid, who crossed the Firth of Forth
and was slain by Cadwallawn of the line of Dyfi.  Even if Geoffrey
understood the references in the poem, which he probably did not, it
must have seemed to him good material to work over and put in the mouth
of Merlin.  This would lead to the confusion about the later kings of
Norman line as they do not quite follow the same pattern.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[39](vmeng.htm#fr_39) (675.md)  Alanus explains
that the “Helmeted Man” was the name given to one of the mountains of
Scotland because of its shape.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[40](vmeng.htm#fr_40) (681-683.md)  From the
*Historia*, VII, iii.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[41](vmeng.htm#fr_41) (687-688.md)  The *Life of
Gildas* by the Monk of Rhuys tells that after Gildas settled in Brittany
people began to flock to him to entrust their sons for their instruction
to his superintendence and teaching.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](vmeng.htm#fr_42) (698.md) Apparently a
reference to the fact told in the Scottish version but not mentioned by
Geoffrey except here, that Rhydderch took St Kentigern under his
protection after he had been driven out of his home in the north.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[42bis](vmeng.htm#fr_43.md) Such Latin epitaphs on
early British tombs are by no means rare.  The grave of Rhydderch Hael
has not been found, but at Warrior’s Rest, near Yarrow, in Selkirkshire,
is an inscription to the sons of his cousin Nudd Hael.

HIC MEMORIAE ET \[BE\]LLO INSIGNISIMI PRINCIPES. NVDI  
DVMNOGENI. HIC IACENT IN TYMVLO. DVO FILII LIBERALIS

According to Sir John Rhys the probable date of the stone is the latter
part of the sixth century.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[43](vmeng.htm#fr_44) (737-820.md)  Much of the
material in this passage must have been taught in every school in
Geoffrey’s time so that it is perhaps useless to expect to find an exact
source for it.  Bede’s *De Natura Rerum* furnishes a fairly close
parallel for much of it and must have been known to Geoffrey since it
seems to have been taught in the Welsh Schools.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[44](vmeng.htm#fr_45) (779-780.md)  For this same
material in the *Historia* Geoffrey refers us to the work of Apuleius on
*The God of Socrates* but a number of other parallels exist.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[45](vmeng.htm#fr_46) (827-854.md)  The whole
passage on fish follows closely Isidore of Seville’s *Etymologiae sive
Origines*, XII, vi.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[46](vmeng.htm#fr_47) (871.md)  The account of
Bladud is to be found in the *Historia*, II, x.  The name of Alaron is
not recorded in Wales, but “Alarun” is recorded as a woman’s name in
Brittany in 1152, which supports the reading of the manuscript in this
passage.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[47](vmeng.htm#fr_48) (875-909.md)  The account of
the islands is from Isidore, XIV, vi.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[48](vmeng.htm#fr_49) (908ff.md)  The description
of the Fortunate Isles comes largely from classical tradition (much of
it is to be found in Isidore), but it seems also to be influenced by
Celtic legends of the happy otherworld.  There is a significant passage
in Pomponius Mela, *De Situ Orbis*, III, 6, which reflects ancient
Celtic tradition.

“Sena in Britannico mari, Osismicis adversa litoribus, Gallici numinis
oraculo insignis est; cuius antistes, perpetua virginitate sanctae,
numero novem esse traduntur; Gallicenas vocant, putantque ingeniis
singularibus praeditas, maria ac ventos concitare carminibus, seque in
quae velint animalia vertere, sanare, quae apud alios insanabilia sunt,
scire ventura et praedicare, sed no nisi deditas navigantibus, et in id
tantum, ut se consulerent profectis.”

The *Gesta Regum Britanniae* (IX, 4213-4234) which, although slightly
later in date than this poem may represent independent tradition, gives
a somewhat similar account.  So too, a later Welsh version, which shows
French influence but may also contain native elements, says that Uther
caused Dioneta, daughter of Gwrleis and Eigyr to be sent to the Isle of
Avallach, and of all in her age she was the most skilled in the seven
arts.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[49](vmeng.htm#fr_50) (924.md)  Although these
three places are usually rendered Brest, Chartres, and Pavia, the last
is sometimes translated as Paris.  R.S.Loomis has suggested that Bristi
may be the locative of the Latin name for Bristol.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[50](vmeng.htm#fr_51) (930.md)  Geoffrey may have
got his Barinthus from an early tradition in which he was god of the sea
and the otherworld rather than from the *Navigatio Brendani* as is
sometimes suggested.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[51](vmeng.htm#fr_52) (962.md)  On the basis of
Book XII of the *Historia*, the three are probably Cadvan, Cadwallo, and
Cadwallader.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[52](vmeng.htm#fr_53) (967-968.md)  For this
prophecy among the Welsh before Geoffrey, see Introduction.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[53](vmeng.htm#fr_54) (982ff.md)  More or less a
summary of the *Historia*, VI, v-xix; VIII, i - XI, v.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[54](vmeng.htm#fr_55) (986.md)  In spite of the
testimony of Bede that the Gewissi were a people of the West Saxons,
J.J.Parry believes that Geoffrey was referring to a British people, and
that his contemporaries would have understood this to be so.  Alanus,
who was almost a contemporary, explains that the Gewissi were “a people
of the Britons”, and the early Welsh translation in the *Red Book* says
that Vortigern was “earl of Gwent and Ergig and Euas” (that is, Ercing
and Ewias, the districts on the two sides of the Wye); for the “Gewissi”
of *Historia*, XII, xiv, this same text has “euas and Ergig,” while
“Octavius, Duke of the Wissei” of V, viii becomes “Eudaf, Earl of Ergig
and Euas.”  Even the Latin text makes Vortigern take refuge “in natione
hergign super fluvium Guaie.”  The Welsh name for the people of Gwent
was “Gwennwys” or “Gwenhwyson”, and there is a dialect of Welsh in that
district known as “Gwenhwyseg.”  From some form of this word came the
name “Gewissi”.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[55](vmeng.htm#fr_56) (1033.md)  The Welsh form of
this name is Ronwen (*Red Book* passim).

<span id="fn_56"></span>[56](vmeng.htm#fr_57) (1104.md)  In the *Historia*
this is “Lucio Tiberio”, although some of the manuscripts also read
“Lucio Hybero”.  The weight of evidence is in favour of “Hybero”.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[57](vmeng.htm#fr_58) (1136ff.md)  Such healing
fountains springing up suddenly are quite common in Celtic tales.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[58](vmeng.htm#fr_59) (1179-1242.md)  These lines
on fountains follow closely after Isidore of Seville, XIII, xiii.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[58bis](vmeng.htm#fr_60.md) The closest Welsh
parallel to this is to be found in the *Iolo Manuscripts* (Second
edition, pp 189 and 601)

“The Stag answered him thus: ‘Thou seest, my friend and companion, this
oak by which I lie, it is at present no more than an old withered stump,
without leaves or branches, but I remember seeing it an acorn in the top
of the chief tree of this forest, and it grew into an oak, and an oak is
three hundred years in growing, and after that three hundred years in
its strength and prime, and after that three hundred years decaying
before death, and after death three hundred years returning into earth,
and upwards of sixty years of the last hundred of this oak are past, and
the Owl has been old since I first remember her.”

The *Iolo Manuscript* is late, but early forms of this tale are known,
see especially *Culhwch and Olwen*.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[59](vmeng.htm#fr_61) (1301-1386.md)  The
description of the birds is from Isidore, XII, vii.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[60](vmeng.htm#fr_62) (1386.md)  This incident may
be based on one in the Irish *Voyage of Maelduin*.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[61](vmeng.htm#fr_63) (1402.md)  Argustli is the
modern Arwystli, a district in the central part of Wales.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[62](vmeng.htm#fr_64) (1474.md)  The Welsh still
use the name Rhydychen or Oxen’s Ford for the city of Oxford.  This
incident may relate either to the events of 24 June 1139, or to those of
Easter Week, 1215.  In 1139, the Bishops Roger of Salisbury and
Alexander of Lincoln were seized by Stephen at the instigation of the
Court, whilst Bishop Nigel of Ely fled to Roger’s castle at Devizes. 
Thereafter Roger was dragged to Devizes and forced to open and surrender
the castle.  In 1215, King John went to Oxford to confer with his
rebellious barons, at which time Oxford must have been filled to
bursting with helms and tiaras.  The line “Pastor … reserare sui cogetur
fictile dampni,” may well refer to the signing of the Magna Carta later
in the year.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[63](vmeng.htm#fr_65) (1479.md)  Again the
possibility of two events being referred to is apparent.  The name
Kaerloidcoit refers regularly to Lichfield, and an error of Geoffrey in
the *Historia* has caused it to be attached to Lincoln.  It is
undoubtedly the “caerlwytcoet” or “city of the gray wood” of the *Red
Book* translation, which there seems to be used for Lincoln.  It could,
therefore, Have been the Battle of Lincoln of 2 February 1141 in which
Stephen blockaded William de Roumare and Randolf of Chester in Lincoln
castle, Chester managing to escape and return with the Welsh under
Robert of Gloucester and capture Stephen - the ‘sidera’ capturing the
‘sun’.  Alternatively it could refer to the capture of Lincoln in April
of 1217.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[64](vmeng.htm#fr_66) (1485.md)  Caerwent is the
regular Welsh name for the City of Winchester.  Yet again there are two
possible events referred to here.  On 14 September 1141, Queen Matilda
and Empress Matilda (the two moons?) brought their rival forces to
Winchester.  Winchester also hosted the events of 20 July 1213 when King
John and Stephen Langton met.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[65](vmeng.htm#fr_67) (1498.md)  The reference here
is probably to the battle of Coleshill in Flint fought in 1150, in which
Madoc ab Maredudd and Randolf, Earl of Chester, were defeated with great
slaughter by Owen Gwynedd, and were driven back out of Wales.  The
“great Coel” is Coel Godebog.
