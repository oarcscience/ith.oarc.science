<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>FOUR and twenty bonny boys<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were playing at the ba',<BR>
And up it stands him sweet Sir Hugh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower among them a'.</P>
<P>He kicked the ba' there wi' his foot,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And keppit it wi' his knee,<BR>
Till even in at the Jew's window<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He gart the bonny ba' flee.</P>
<P>"Cast out the ba' to me, fair maid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast out the ba' to me."<BR>
"Never a bit," says the Jew's daughter,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till ye come up to me."</P>

<P>"Come up, sweet Hugh, come up, dear Hugh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come up and get the ba'."<BR>
"I winna come, I mayna come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without my bonny boys a'."</P>
<P>She's ta'en her to the Jew's garden,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the grass grew lang and green,<BR>
She's pu'd an apple red and white,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wyle the bonny boy in.</P>
<P>She's wyled him in through ae chamber,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She's wyled him in through twa,<BR>
She's wyled him into the third chamber,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was the warst o' a'.</P>
<P>She's tied the little boy, hands and feet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She's pierced him wi' a knife,<BR>
She's caught his heart's blood in a golden cup,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And twinn'd him o' his life.</P>
<P>She row'd him in a cake o' lead,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade him lie still and sleep,<BR>
She cast him in a deep draw-well<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fifty fathom deep.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></P>
<P>When bells were rung, and mass was sung,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every bairn went hame,<BR>
Then ilka lady had her young son,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lady Helen had nane.</P>
<P>She row'd her mantle her about,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sair, sair 'gan she weep;<BR>
And she ran unto the Jew's house,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were all asleep.</P>
<P>"My bonny Sir Hugh, my pretty Sir Hugh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray thee to me speak!"<BR>
"Lady Helen, come to the deep draw-well<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Gin ye your son wad seek."</P>
<P>Lady Helen ran to the deep draw-well,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And knelt upon her knee:<BR>
"My bonny Sir Hugh, an ye be here,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray thee speak to me!"</P>
<P>"The lead is wondrous heavy, mither,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The well is wondrous deep;<BR>
A keen penknife sticks in my heart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard for me to speak.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Gae hame, gae hame, my mither dear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetch me my winding-sheet;<BR>
And at the back o' merry Lincoln,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's there we twa sall meet."</P>
<P>Now Lady Helen she's gane hame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him a winding-sheet;<BR>
And at the back o' merry Lincoln,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead corpse did her meet.</P>
<P>And a' the bells o' merry Lincoln<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without men's hands were rung;<BR>
And a' the books o' merry Lincoln<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were read without men's tongue:<BR>
Never was such a burial<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin' Adam's days begun.</P>
