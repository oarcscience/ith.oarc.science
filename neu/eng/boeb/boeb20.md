# Waly, Waly, Love be Bonny

### A SCOTTISH SONG

O WALY, waly up the bank,  
  And waly, waly down the brae,  
And waly, waly yon burn side,  
  Where I and my love were wont to gae.  
I leant my back unto an aik,  
  I thought it was a trusty tree;  
But first it bow'd, and syne it brak,  
  Sae my true love did lichtly me.

O waly, waly, but gin love be bonny,  
  A little time while it is new;  
But when its auld, it waxeth cauld,  
  And fades awa' like morning dew. <span id="page_127">p. 127</span>  
O wherfore shuld I busk my head?  
  Or wherfore shuld I kame my hair?  
For my true love has me forsook,  
  And says he'll never loe me mair.

Now Arthur-Seat sall be my bed,  
  The sheets shall neir be prest by me:  
Saint Anton's well sall be my drink,  
  Since my true love has forsaken me.  
Marti'mas wind, when wilt thou blaw,  
  And shake the green leaves aff the tree?  
O gentle death, when wilt thou cum?  
  For of my life I am wearìe.

'Tis not the frost that freezes fell,  
  Nor blawing snaws inclemencìe;  
'Tis not sic cauld that makes me cry,  
  But my love's heart grown cauld to me.  
Whan we came in by Glasgow town,  
  We were a comely sight to see;  
My love was clad in black velvet,  
  And I myself in cramasìe.

But had I wist, before I kist,  
  That love had been sae ill to win, <span id="page_128">p. 128</span>  
I had lockt my heart in a case of gowd,  
  And pinnd it with a siller pin.  
And, oh! that my young babe were born,  
  And set upon the nurse's knee,  
And I myself were dead and gane!  
  And the green grass growing over me.
