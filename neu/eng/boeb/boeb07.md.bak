# Phillida and Corydon

IN the merrie moneth of Maye,  
In a morne by break of daye,  
With a troope of damselles playing  
Forthe 'I yode' forsooth a maying;

When anon by a wood side,  
Where that Maye was in his pride,  
I espied all alone  
Phillida and Corydon.

Much adoe there was, God wot:  
He wold love, and she wold not.  
She sayde, "Never man was trewe;"  
He sayes, "None was false to you."

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

He sayde, hee had lovde her longe;  
She sayes, love should have no wronge.  
Corydon wold kisse her then;  
She sayes, "Maydes must kisse no men,

"Tyll they doe for good and all."  
When she made the shepperde call  
All the heavens to wytnes truthe,  
Never loved a truer youthe.

Then with manie a prettie othe,  
Yea and nay, and faithe and trothe,  
Suche as seelie shepperdes use  
When they will not love abuse,

Love, that had bene long deluded,  
Was with kisses sweete concluded;  
And Phillida with garlands gaye  
Was made the lady of the Maye.
