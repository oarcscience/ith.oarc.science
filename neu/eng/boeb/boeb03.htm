<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>GOD prosper long our noble king,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our liffes and safetyes all;<BR>
A woefull hunting once there did<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chevy-Chace befall.</P>
<P>To drive the deere with hound and horne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Erle Percy took his way;<BR>
The child may rue that is unborne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunting of that day.</P>
<P>The stout Erle of Northumberland<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A vow to God did make,<BR>
His pleasure in the Scottish woods<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three summers days to take;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A></P>
<P>The cheefest harts in Chevy-Chace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill and beare away:<BR>
These tydings to Erle Douglas came,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scotland where he lay.</P>
<P>Who sent Erie Percy present word,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He wold prevent his sport;<BR>
The English Erle not fearing that,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did to the woods resort,</P>
<P>With fifteen hundred bow-men bold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All chosen men of might,<BR>
Who knew full well in time of neede<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To ayme their shafts arright.</P>
<P>The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To chase the fallow deere;<BR>
On Munday they began to hunt,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere day-light did appeare;</P>
<P>And long before high noone they had<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An hundred fat buckes slaine;<BR>
Then having din'd, the drovyers went<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To rouze the deare againe.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A></P>
<P>The bow-men mustered on the hills,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well able to endure;<BR>
Theire backsides all, with speciall care,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That day were guarded sure.</P>
<P>The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nimble deere to take,<BR>
That with their cryes the hills and dales<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An eccho shrill did make.</P>
<P>Lord Percy to the quarry went,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the tender deere;<BR>
Quoth he, "Erle Douglas promised<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This day to meet me heere;</P>
<P>"But if I thought he wold not come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Noe longer wold I stay."<BR>
With that, a brave younge gentleman<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to the Erle did say:</P>
<P>"Loe, yonder doth Erle Douglas come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His men in armour bright;<BR>
Full twenty hundred Scottish speres,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All marching in our sight.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></P>
<P>"All men of pleasant Tivydale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast by the river Tweede:"<BR>
"O cease your sport," Erle Percy said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And take your bowes with speede.</P>
<P>"And now with me, my countrymen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your courage forth advance;<BR>
For never was there champion yett<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scotland or in France,</P>
<P>"That ever did on horsebacke come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if my hap it were,<BR>
I durst encounter man for man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With him to breake a spere."</P>
<P>Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like a baron bold,<BR>
Rode formost of his company,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose armour shone like gold.</P>
<P>"Show me," sayd hee, "whose men you bee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That hunt soe boldly heere,<BR>
That, without my consent, doe chase<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kill my fallow-deere."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A></P>
<P>The man that first did answer make<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was noble Percy hee;<BR>
Who sayd, "Wee list not to declare,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shew whose men wee bee.</P>
<P>"Yet will wee spend our deerest blood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy cheefest harts to slay;"<BR>
Then Douglas swore a solempne oathe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in rage did say;</P>
<P>"Ere thus I will out-braved bee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One of us two shall dye:<BR>
I know thee well, an erle thou art;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Percy, soe am I.</P>
<P>"But trust me, Percy, pittye it were,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And great offence, to kill<BR>
Any of these our guiltlesse men,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For they have done no ill.</P>
<P>"Let thou and I the battell trye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And set our men aside."<BR>
"Accurst bee he," Erle Percy sayd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By whome this is denyed."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then stept a gallant squier forth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Witherington was his name,<BR>
Who said, "I wold not have it told<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Henry our king for shame,</P>
<P>"That ere my captaine fought on foote,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I stood looking on:<BR>
You bee two erles," sayd Witherington,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I a squier alone.</P>
<P>"Ile doe the best that doe I may,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have power to stand;<BR>
While I have power to weeld my sword,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ile fight with hart and hand."</P>
<P>Our English archers bent their bowes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their harts were good and trew;<BR>
Att the first flight of arrowes sent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full four-score Scots they slew.</P>
<P>[Yet bides Earl Douglas on the bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Chieftain stout and good,<BR>
As valiant Captain, all unmov'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock he firmly stood.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>His host he parted had in three,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Leader ware and try'd,<BR>
And soon his spearmen on their foes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare down on every side.</P>
<P>Throughout the English archery<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They dealt full many a wound;<BR>
But still our valiant Englishmen<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All firmly kept their ground.</P>
<P>And throwing strait their bows away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They grasp'd their swords so bright:<BR>
And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On shields and helmets light.]</P>
<P>They clos'd full fast on everye side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Noe slacknes there was found;<BR>
And many a gallant gentleman<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay gasping on the ground.</P>
<P>O Christ! it was a griefe to see,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And likewise for to heare,<BR>
The cries of men lying in their gore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered here and there.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></P>
<P>At last these two stout erles did meet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like captaines of great might;<BR>
Like lyons wood they layd on lode,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a cruell fight.</P>
<P>They fought, untill they both did sweat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With swords of tempered steele;<BR>
Until the blood, like drops of rain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They trickling downe did feele.</P>
<P>"Yeeld thee, Lord Percy," Douglas sayd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"In faith I will thee bringe,<BR>
Where thou shalt high advanc&egrave;d bee<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By James our Scottish king.</P>
<P>"Thy ransom I will freely give,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus report of thee,<BR>
Thou art the most couragious knight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever I did see."</P>
<P>"Noe, Douglas," quoth Erle Percy then,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy proffer I doe scorne<BR>
I will not yeelde to any Scott,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever yett was borne."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_03600"></A>
<A HREF="img/03600.jpg"><IMG SRC="tn/03600.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=-3>Click to enlarge</FONT></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>With that, there came an arrow keene<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of an English bow,<BR>
Which struck Erle Douglas to the heart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A deepe and deadlye blow:</P>
<P>Who never spake more words than these,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fight on, my merry men all;<BR>
For why, my life is at an end:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Percy sees my fall."</P>
<P>Then leaving liffe, Erle Percy tooke<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead man by the hand;<BR>
And said, "Erle Douglas, for thy life<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wold I had lost my land!</P>
<P>"O Christ! my verry hart doth bleed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sorrow for thy sake;<BR>
For sure, a more renown&egrave;d knight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mischance cold never take."</P>
<P>A knight amongst the Scotts there was,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which saw Erle Douglas dye,<BR>
Who streight in wrath did vow revenge<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Lord Percye;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A></P>
<P>Sir Hugh Mountgomerye was he call'd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, with a spere most bright,<BR>
Well-mounted on a gallant steed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran fiercely through the fight;</P>
<P>And past the English archers all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without all dread or feare,<BR>
And through Earl Percyes body then<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He thrust his hatefull spere</P>
<P>With such a vehement force and might<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He did his body gore,<BR>
The speare ran through the other side<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A large cloth-yard, and more.</P>
<P>So thus did both these nobles dye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose courage none could staine;<BR>
An English archer then perceiv'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble erle was slaine.</P>
<P>He had a bow bent in his hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of a trusty tree;<BR>
An arrow of a cloth-yard long<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the head drew hee.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_03800"></A>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></P>
<P>Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So right the shaft he sett,<BR>
The grey goose-wing that was thereon<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his harts bloode was wett.</P>
<P>This fight did last from breake of day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till setting of the sun;<BR>
For when they rung the evening bell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The battel scarce was done.</P>
<P>With stout Erle Percy, there was slaine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John of Egerton,<BR>
Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir James, that bold Bar&ograve;n.</P>
<P>And with Sir George and stout Sir James,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both knights of good account,<BR>
Good Sir Ralph Rabby there was slaine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose prowesse did surmount.</P>
<P>For Witherington needs must I wayle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As one in doleful dumpes;<BR>
For when his legs were smitten off,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fought upon his stumpes.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></P>
<P>And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,<BR>
Sir Charles Murray, that from the feeld<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One foote wold never flee.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Murray of Ratcliff, too,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His sisters sonne was hee;<BR>
Sir David Lamb, so well esteem'd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet sav&egrave;d cold not bee.</P>
<P>And the Lord Maxwell in like case<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did with Erle Douglas dye;<BR>
Of twenty hundred Scottish speres,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce fifty-five did flye.</P>
<P>Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went home but fifty-three;<BR>
The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chace,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the greene wood tree.</P>
<P>Next day did many widowes come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their husbands to bewayle;<BR>
They washt their wounds in brinish teares,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But all wold not prevayle.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></P>
<P>Theyr bodyes, bathed in purple blood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They bore with them away:<BR>
They kist them dead a thousand times,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they were cladd in clay.</P>
<P>This newes was brought to Eddenborrow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Scotlands king did raigne,<BR>
That brave Erle Douglas suddenlye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was with an arrow slaine.</P>
<P>"O heavy newes," King James did say;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scottland can witnesse bee,<BR>
I have not any captaine more<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such account as hee."</P>
<P>Like tydings to King Henry came,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within as short a space,<BR>
That Percy of Northumberland<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was slaine in Chevy-Chace.</P>
<P>"Now God be with him," said our king,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sith it will noe better bee;<BR>
I trust I have, within my realme,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred as good as hee.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Yett shall not Scotts nor Scotland say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will vengeance take,<BR>
I'll be reveng&egrave;d on them all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For brave Erle Percyes sake."</P>
<P>This vow full well the king perform'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After, at Humbledowne;<BR>
In one day, fifty knights were slayne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With lordes of great renowne.</P>
<P>And of the rest, of small account,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did many thousands dye:<BR>
Thus endeth the hunting in Chevy-Chace,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by the Erle Percy.</P>
<P>God save our king, and bless this land<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In plentye, joy, and peace;<BR>
And grant henceforth, that foule debate<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt noblemen may cease!</P>
