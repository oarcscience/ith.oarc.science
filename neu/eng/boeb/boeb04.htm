<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>I READ that once in Affrica<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A princely wight did raine,<BR>
Who had to name Cophetua,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As poets they did faine.<BR>
From natures lawes he did decline,<BR>
For sure he was not of my minde,<BR>
He cared not for women-kind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But did them all disdaine.<BR>
But marke what hapned on a day;<BR>
As he out of his window lay,<BR>
He saw a beggar all in gray.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The which did cause his paine.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></P>
<P>The blinded boy that shootes so trim<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From heaven downe did hie,<BR>
He drew a dart and shot at him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In place where he did lye:<BR>
Which soone did pierse him to the quicke,<BR>
And when he felt the arrow pricke,<BR>
Which in his tender heart did sticke,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He looketh as he would dye.<BR>
What sudden chance is this," quoth he,<BR>
"That I to love must subject be,<BR>
Which never thereto would agree,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But still did it defie?"</P>
<P>Then from the window he did come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid him on his bed;<BR>
A thousand heapes of care did runne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within his troubled head.<BR>
For now he meanes to crave her love,<BR>
And now he seekes which way to proove<BR>
How he his fancie might remoove,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not this beggar wed.<BR>
But Cupid had him so in snare,<BR>
That this poor begger must prepare <A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A><BR>
A salve to cure him of his care,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or els he would be dead.</P>
<P>And as he musing thus did lye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for to devise<BR>
How he might have her companye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That so did 'maze his eyes.<BR>
"In thee," quoth he, "doth rest my life;<BR>
For surely thou shalt be my wife,<BR>
Or else this hand with bloody knife,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gods shall sure suffice."<BR>
Then from his bed he soon arose,<BR>
And to his pallace gate he goes;<BR>
Full little then this begger knowes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When she the king espies.</P>
<P>"The gods preserve your majesty,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggers all gan cry;<BR>
"Vouchsafe to give your charity,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our childrens food to buy."<BR>
The king to them his purse did cast,<BR>
And they to part it made great haste;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></P>
<P>This silly woman was the last<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That after them did hye.<BR>
The king he cal'd her back againe,<BR>
And unto her he gave his chaine;<BR>
And said, "With us you shal remaine<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till such time as we dye.</P>
<P>"For thou," quoth he, "shalt be my wife,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And honoured for my queene;<BR>
With thee I meane to lead my life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As shortly shall be seene:<BR>
Our wedding shall appointed be,<BR>
And every thing in its degree;<BR>
"Come on," quoth he, "and follow me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt go shift thee cleane.<BR>
What is thy name, faire maid?" quoth he.<BR>
"Penelophon, O King," quoth she;<BR>
With that she made a lowe courts&egrave;y;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A trim one as I weene.</P>
<P>Thus hand in hand along they walke<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the king's pall&agrave;ce:<BR>
The king with courteous, comly talke<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This begger doth embrace.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>The begger blusheth scarlet red,<BR>
And straight againe as pale as lead,<BR>
But not a word at all she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was in such amaze.<BR>
At last she spake with trembling voyce,<BR>
And said, "O King, I doe rejoyce<BR>
That you wil take me for your choyce,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my degree so base."</P>
<P>And when the wedding day was come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The king commanded strait<BR>
The noblemen, both all and some,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the queene to wait.<BR>
And she behaved herself that day<BR>
As if she had never walkt the way;<BR>
She had forgot her gowne of gray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which she did weare of late.<BR>
The proverbe old is come to passe,<BR>
The priest, when he begins his masse,<BR>
Forgets that ever clerke he was<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He knowth not his estate.</P>
<P>Here you may read Cophetua,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through long time fancie-fed, <A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A><BR>
Compelled by the blinded boy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The begger for to wed:<BR>
He that did lovers lookes disdaine,<BR>
To do the same was glad and faine,<BR>
Or else he would himselfe have slaine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In storie, as we read.<BR>
Disdaine no whit, O lady deere,<BR>
But pitty now thy servant heere,<BR>
Least that it hap to thee this yeare,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As to that king it did.</P>
<P>And thus they led a quiet life<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;During their princely raine,<BR>
And in a tombe were buried both,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As writers sheweth plaine.<BR>
The lords they tooke it grievously,<BR>
The ladies tooke it heavily,<BR>
The commons cryed pitiously,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their death to them was paine.<BR>
Their fame did sound so passingly,<BR>
That it did pierce the starry sky,<BR>
And throughout all the world did flye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To every princes realme.</P>
