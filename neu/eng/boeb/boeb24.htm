<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FIRST FYTTE</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>IT fell about the Lammas tide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When husbands winn their hay,<BR>
The doughty Douglas bound him to ride<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into England to take a prey.</P>
<P>The Earl of Fife, withouten strife,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He bound him over Solway;<BR>
The great would ever together ride<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That race they may rue for aye.</P>
<P>Over Ottercap hill they came in,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so down by Rotheley crag,<BR>
Upon Green Leighton they lighted down,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Styrande many a stag;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>And boldly brente Northumberland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And harried many a town;<BR>
They did our Englishmen great wrong<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle that were not bown.</P>
<P>Then spake a berne upon the bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of comfort that was not cold,<BR>
And said, "We have brente Northumberland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all wealth in holde.</P>
<P>"Now we have harried all Bamborough shire<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wealth in the world have we;<BR>
I rede we ride to Newcastle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So still and stalworthlye."</P>
<P>Upon the morrow, when it was day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The standards shone full bright;<BR>
To the Newcastle they took the way,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thither they came full right.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Percy lay at the Newcastle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you, withouten dread;<BR>
He has been a March-man all his days,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept Berwick upon Tweed.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></P>
<P>To the Newcastle when they came,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scots they cried on hyght:<BR>
"Sir Harry Percy, an thou bist within,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to the field and fight:</P>
<P>"For we have brente Northumberland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy heritage good and right;<BR>
And syne my lodging I have take,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With my brand dubbed many a knight."</P>
<P>Sir Harry Percy came to the walls,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scottish host for to see:<BR>
"And thou hast brente Northumberland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full sore it rueth me.</P>
<P>"If thou hast harried all Bamborough shire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast done me great envy;<BR>
For the tresp&agrave;ss thou hast me done,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The one of us shall die."</P>
<P>"Where shall I bide thee?" said the Douglas;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or where wilt thou come to me?<BR>
"At Otterburn in the high way,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There mayst thou well lodged be.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></P>
<P>The roe full reckless there she runs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make thee game and glee;<BR>
The falcon and the pheasant both,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the holtes on hee.</P>
<P>"There mayst thou have thy wealth at will,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well lodged there mayst thou be;<BR>
It shall not be long ere I come thee till,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Sir Harry Percy&egrave;.</P>
<P>There shall I bide thee," said the Douglas,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the faith of my bod&#7923;."<BR>
"Thither shall I come," said Sir Harry Perc&#7923;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My troth I plight to thee."</P>
<P>A pipe of wine he gave them over the walls,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth, as I you say;<BR>
There he made the Douglas drink,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his host that day.</P>
<P>The Douglas turned him homeward again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth withouten nay;<BR>
He took his lodging at Otterburn<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a Wedn&egrave;sday;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A></P>
<P>And there he pyght his standard down.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His getting more and less;<BR>
And syne he warned his men to go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And get their geldings gress.</P>
<P>A Scottish knight hoved upon the bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A watch I dare well say;<BR>
So was he ware on the noble Perc&#7923;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dawning of the day.</P>
<P>He pricked to his pavilion door,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fast as he might ronne;<BR>
"Awaken, Douglas!" cried the knight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For His love that sits in throne.</P>
<P>"Awaken, Douglas!" cried the knight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For thou mayst waken with wynne;<BR>
Yonder have I spied the proud Perc&#7923;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seven stand&agrave;rds with him."</P>
<P>Nay, by my troth," the Douglas said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is but a feign&egrave;d tale;<BR>
He durst not look on my broad bann&egrave;r,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all Engl&agrave;nd so hayle</P>
<P><A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Was I not yesterday at the Newcastle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That stands so fair on Tyne?<BR>
For all the men the Percy had,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not garre me once to dyne."</P>
<P>He stepped out at his pavilion door,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To look, and it were less;<BR>
"Array you, lordyngs, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For here begins no peace.</P>
<P>"The Earl of Menteith, thou art my eme,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The forward I give to thee;<BR>
The Earl of Huntley cawte and keen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall with thee be.</P>
<P>"The Lord of Buchan, in armour bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand he shall be;<BR>
Lord Johnstone, and Lord Maxwell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They two shall be with me.</P>
<P>"Swynton fair field upon your pride<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle make you bowen;<BR>
Sir Davy Scot, Sir Walter Steward,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John of Agerstone."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></P>
</FONT><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SECOND FYTTE</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>The Percy came before his host,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ever was a gentle knight,<BR>
Upon the Douglas loud did he cry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will hold that I have hight;</P>
<P>"For thou hast brente Northumberland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And done me great env&#7923;;<BR>
For this tresp&agrave;ss thou hast me done<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The one of us shall die."</P>
<P>The Douglas answered him again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With great words up on hee,<BR>
And said, "I have twenty against thy one,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, and thou mayst see."</P>
<P>With that the Percy was griev&egrave;d sore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth as I you say;<BR>
He lighted down upon his foot,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shot his horse clean away</P>
<P><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></P>
<P>Every man saw that he did so,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ryall was ever in rout;<BR>
Every man shot his horse him fro,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And light him round about.</P>
<P>Thus Sir Harry Percy took the field,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth as I you say,<BR>
Jesu Christ in heaven on high,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did help him well that day.</P>
<P>But nine thousand, there was no more,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If chronicle will not layne;<BR>
Forty thousand Scots and four<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That day fought them again,</P>
<P>But when the battle began to join,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In haste there came a knight,<BR>
Then letters fair forth hath he ta'en,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he said full right:</P>
<P>"My lord, your father he greets you well,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a noble knight;<BR>
He desires you to bide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he may see this fight.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A></P>
<P>"The baron of Grastock is come out of the west,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With him a noble company;<BR>
All they lodge at your father's this night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the battle fain would they see."</P>
<P>For Jesu's love," said Sir Harry Perc&#7923;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That died for you and me,<BR>
Wend to my lord, my father, again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And say thou saw me not with ee;</P>
<P>"My troth is plight to yon Scottish knight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs me not to layne,<BR>
That I should bide him upon this bent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have his troth again;</P>
<P>"And if that I wend off this ground,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth unfoughten away,<BR>
He would me call but a coward knight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his land another day.</P>
<P>"Yet had I lever to be rynde and rent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Mary that mykel may,<BR>
Than ever my manhood should be reproved<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a Scot another day.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Wherefore shoot, archers, for my sake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And let sharp arrows flee;<BR>
Minstrels, play up for your warison,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And well quit it shall be.</P>
<P>"Every man think on his true love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mark him to the Trinit&#7923;;<BR>
For to God I make mine a-vow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This day will I not flee."</P>
<P>The bloody heart in the Douglas' arms,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His standard stood on high,<BR>
That every man might full well know;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside stood starr&egrave;s three.</P>
<P>The white Li&ograve;n on the English part,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth as I you sayne,<BR>
The luces and the crescents both<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scots fought them again.</P>
<P>Upon Saint Andrew loud did they cry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrice they shout on hyght,<BR>
And syne marked them on our Englishmen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have told you right.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></P>
<P>Saint George the bright, our Lady's knight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To name they were full fain,<BR>
Our Englishmen they cried on hyght,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrice they shout again.</P>
<P>With that sharp arrows began to flee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you in certain;<BR>
Men of arms began to join;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a doughty man was there slain.</P>
<P>The Percy and the Douglas met,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That either of them was fain;<BR>
They schapped together, while that they sweat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With swords of fine Collayne;</P>
<P>Till the blood from their basenets ran<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the roke doth in the rain.<BR>
"Yield thee to me," said the Douglas,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or else thou shalt be slain;</P>
<P>"For I see by thy bright basenet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art some man of might;<BR>
And so I do by thy burnished brand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art an earl, or else a knight."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></P>
<P>"By my good faith," said the noble Perc&#7923;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now hast thou rede full right;<BR>
Yet will I never yield me to thee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While I may stand and fight."</P>
<P>They swapped together, while that they sweat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sword&egrave;s sharp and long;<BR>
Each on other so fast they beat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their helms came in pieces down.</P>
<P>The Percy was a man of strength,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you in this stound<BR>
He smote the Douglas at the sword's length,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he felled him to the ground.</P>
<P>The sword was sharp, and sore did byte,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you in cert&agrave;in;<BR>
To the heart he did him smite,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was the Douglas slain.</P>
<P>The standards stood still on each side;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a grievous groan,<BR>
There they fought the day, and all the night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a doughty man was slone.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></P>
<P>There was no freyke that there would fly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But stiffly in stour did stand,<BR>
Echone hewing on other while they might dry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a baleful brand.</P>
<P>There was slain upon the Scottes side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth and certainl&#7923;,<BR>
Sir James of Douglas there was slain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That day that he did die.</P>
<P>The Earl of Menteith he was slain.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grysely groaned upon the ground;<BR>
Sir Davy Scot, Sir Walter Steward,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John of Agerstone.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Murray in that place,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That never a foot would fly;<BR>
Sir Hugh Maxw&egrave;ll, a lord he was,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Douglas did he die.</P>
<P>There was slain upon the Scottes side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth as I you say,<BR>
Of four and forty thousand Scots,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went but eighteen away.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was slain upon the English side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth and certainl&#7923;,<BR>
A gentle knight, Sir John Fitzhugh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the more pit&#7923;.</P>
<P>Sir James Harebotell there was slain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For him their hearts were sore<BR>
The gentle Lovel there was slain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Percy's standard bore.</P>
<P>There was slain upon the English side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sooth as I you say,<BR>
Of nine thousand Englishmen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred came away;</P>
<P>The others were slayn&egrave; in the field,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ keep their souls from woe,<BR>
Seeing there were so few friends<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against so many a foe!</P>
<P>Then on the morn they made them biers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of birch and hazel gray;<BR>
Many a widow with weeping tears<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their makes they fetch away.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></P>
<P>This fray began at Otterburn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the night and the day;<BR>
There the Douglas lost his life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Percy was led away.</P>
<P>Then was there a Scottish prisoner ta'en,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Hugh Montgomery was his name,<BR>
For sooth as I you say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He borrowed the Percy home again.</P>
<P>Now let us all for the Percy pray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Jesu most of might,<BR>
To bring his soul to the bliss of heaven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was a gentle knight.</P>
