<P>"RISE up, rise up, now, Lord Douglas," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And put on your armour so bright;<BR>
Sweet William will hae Lady Margaret awi'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that it be light.</P>
<P>"Rise up, rise up, my seven bold sons,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put on your armour so bright,<BR>
And take better care of your youngest sist&egrave;r,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For your eldest's awa' the last night."</P>
<P>He's mounted her on a milk-white steed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And himself on a dapple grey,<BR>
With a buglet horn hung down by his side<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lightly they rode away.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></P>
<P>Lord William lookit o'er his left should&egrave;r,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what he could see,<BR>
And there he spied her seven brethren bold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come riding o'er the lea.</P>
<P>"Light down, light down, Lady Margaret," he said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And hold my steed in your hand,<BR>
Until that against your seven brethren bold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And your father I make a stand."</P>
<P>She held his steed in her milk-white hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never shed one tear,<BR>
Until that she saw her seven brethren fa'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her father hard fighting, who loved her so dear.</P>
<P>"O hold your hand, Lord William!" she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For your strokes they are wondrous sair;<BR>
True lovers I can get many a ane,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But a father I can never get mair."</P>
<P>O, she's ta'en out her handkerchief,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was o' the holland sae fine,<BR>
And aye she dighted her father's bloody wounds,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That were redder than the wine.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></P>
<P>"O chuse, O chuse, Lady Margaret," he said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"O whether will ye gang or bide?"<BR>
"I'll gang, I'll gang, Lord William," she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For you have left me nae other guide."</P>
<P>He's lifted her on a milk-white steed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And himself on a dapple grey,<BR>
With a buglet horn hung down by his side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly they baith rade away.</P>
<P>O they rade on, and on they rade,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a' by the light of the moon,<BR>
Until they came to yon wan water,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there they lighted down.</P>
<P>They lighted down to tak a drink<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the spring that ran sae clear;<BR>
And down the stream ran his gude heart's blood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sair she 'gan to fear.</P>
<P>"Hold up, hold up, Lord William," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For I fear that you are slain!"<BR>
"'Tis naething but the shadow of my scarlet cloak,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That shines in the water sae plain."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></P>
<P>O they rade on, and on they rade,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a' by the light of the moon,<BR>
Until they came to his mother's ha' door,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there they lighted down.</P>
<P>"Get up, get up, lady mother," he says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up, and let me in!<BR>
Get up, get up, lady mother," he says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this night my fair lady I've win.</P>
<P>"O mak my bed, lady mother," he says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"O mak it braid and deep!<BR>
And lay Lady Margaret close at my back,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sounder I will sleep."</P>
<P>Lord William was dead lang ere midnight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady Margaret lang ere day:<BR>
And all true lovers that go thegither,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May they have mair luck than they!</P>
<P>Lord William was buried in St. Marie's kirk,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady Margaret in Marie's quire;<BR>
Out o' the lady's grave grew a bonny red rose,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And out o' the knight's a brier.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></P>
<P>And they twa met, and they twa plat<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fain they wad be near;<BR>
And a' the world might ken right weel,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They were twa lovers dear.</P>
<P>But bye and rade the black Douglas<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wow but he was rough!<BR>
For he pulled up the bonny bri&egrave;r,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flanged in St. Marie's Loch.</P>
