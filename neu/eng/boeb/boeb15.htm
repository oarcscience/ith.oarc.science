<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>I WAD I were where Helen lies;<BR>
Night and day on me she cries;<BR>
O that I were where Helen lies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On fair Kirkconnell lea!</P>
<P>Curst be the heart that thought the thought,<BR>
And curst the hand that fired the shot,<BR>
When in my arms burd Helen dropt,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And died to succour me!</P>
<P>O think na but my heart was sair<BR>
When my Love dropt and spak nae mair!<BR>
I laid her down wi' meikle care,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On fair Kirkconnell lea.</P>

<P>As I went down the water side,<BR>
Nane but my foe to be my guide,<BR>
Nane but my foe to be my guide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On fair Kirkconnell lea.</P>
<P>I lighted down my sword to draw,<BR>
I hack&eacute;d him in pieces sma',<BR>
I hack&eacute;d him in pieces sma',<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For her sake that died for me.</P>
<P>O Helen fair, beyond compare!<BR>
I'll make a garland of thy hair,<BR>
Shall bind my heart for evermair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the day I dee!</P>
<P>O that I were where Helen lies<BR>
Night and day on me she cries;<BR>
Out of my bed she bids me rise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Says, "Haste, and come to me!"</P>
<P>O Helen fair! O Helen chaste!<BR>
If I were with thee, I were blest,<BR>
Where thou lies low and takes thy rest,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On fair Kirkconnell lea.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></P>
<P>I wad my grave were growing green,<BR>
A winding-sheet drawn ower my een,<BR>
And I in Helen's arms lying,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On fair Kirkconnell lea.</P>
<P>I wad I were where Helen lies!<BR>
Night and day on me she cries,<BR>
And I am weary of the skies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my Love died for me.</P>
