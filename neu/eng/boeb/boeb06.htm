<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>WHEN as King Henry rulde this land,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The second of that name,<BR>
Besides the queene, he dearly lovde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A faire and comely dame.</P>
<P>Most peerlesse was her beautye founde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her favour, and her face;<BR>
A sweeter creature in this worlde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could never prince embrace.</P>
<P>Her crisped lockes like threads of golde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeard to each man's sight;<BR>
Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearles,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did cast a heavenlye light.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></P>
<P>The blood within her crystal cheekes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did such a colour drive,<BR>
As though the lillye and the rose<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For mastership did strive.</P>
<P>Yea Rosamonde, fair Rosamonde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name was called so,<BR>
To whom our queene, Dame Ellinor,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was known a deadlye foe.</P>
<P>The king therefore, for her defence<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the furious queene,<BR>
At Woodstocke builded such a bower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The like was never seene.</P>
<P>Most curiously that bower was built,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stone and timber strong;<BR>
An hundered and fifty doors<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did to this bower belong:</P>
<P>And they so cunninglye contriv'd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With turnings round about,<BR>
That none but with a clue of thread<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could enter in or out.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></P>
<P>And for his love and ladyes sake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That was so faire and brighte,<BR>
The keeping of this bower he gave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto a valiant knighte.</P>
<P>But fortune, that doth often frowne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where she before did smile,<BR>
The kinges delighte and ladyes joy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full soon shee did beguile:</P>
<P>For why, the kinges ungracious sonne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he did high advance,<BR>
Against his father raised warres<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the realme of France.</P>
<P>But yet before our comelye king<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The English land forsooke,<BR>
Of Rosamond, his lady faire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His farewelle thus he tooke:</P>
<P>My Rosamonde, my only Rose,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That pleasest best mine eye,<BR>
The fairest flower in all the worlde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed my fantasye,--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></P>
<P>"The flower of mine affected heart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sweetness doth excelle,<BR>
My royal Rose, a thousand times<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I bid thee nowe farwelle!</P>
<P>For I must leave my fairest flower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My sweetest Rose, a space,<BR>
And cross the seas to famous France.,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud rebelles to abase.</P>
<P>But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My coming shortlye see,<BR>
And in my heart, when hence I am,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ile beare my Rose with mee."</P>
<P>When Rosamond, that ladye brighte,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did heare the king saye soe,<BR>
The sorrowe of her grieved heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her outward lookes did showe.</P>
<P>And from her cleare and crystall eyes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The teares gusht out apace,<BR>
Which, like the silver-pearled dewe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranne downe her comely face.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></P>
<P>Her lippes, erst like the corall redde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did waxe both wan and pale,<BR>
And for the sorrow she conceivde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her vitall spirits faile.</P>
<P>And falling downe all in a swoone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before King Henryes face,<BR>
Full oft he in his princelye armes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her bodye did embrace.</P>
<P>And twentye times, with watery eyes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He kist her tender cheeke,<BR>
Untill he had revivde againe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her senses milde and meeke.</P>
<P>"Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose?"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The king did often say:<BR>
"Because," quoth shee, "to bloodye warres<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My lord must part awaye.</P>
<P>"But since your Grace on forrayne coastes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amonge your foes unkinde,<BR>
Must goe to hazard life and limbe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I staye behinde?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Nay, rather let me, like a page,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sworde and target beare;<BR>
That on my breast the blowes may lighte,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which would offend you there.</P>
<P>"Or lett mee, in your royal tent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare your bed at nighte,<BR>
And with sweete baths refresh your grace,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At your returne from fighte.</P>
<P>"So I your presence may enjoye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No toil I will refuse;<BR>
But wanting you, my life is death:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, death Ild rather chuse."</P>
<P>"Content thy self, my dearest love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy rest at home shall bee,<BR>
In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For travell fits not thee.</P>
<P>"Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft peace their sexe delightes;<BR>
Not rugged campes, but courtlye bowers;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay feastes, not cruell fightes.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></P>
<P>"My Rose shall safely here abide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With musicke passe the daye,<BR>
Whilst I amonge the piercing pikes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My foes seeke far awaye.</P>
<P>"My Rose shall shine in pearle and golde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst Ime in armour dighte;<BR>
Gay galliards here my love shall dance,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I my foes goe fighte.</P>
<P>"And you, Sir Thomas, whom I truste<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bee my loves defence,<BR>
Be carefull of my gallant Rose<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am parted hence."</P>
<P>And therewithall he fetcht a sigh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As though his heart would breake;<BR>
And Rosamonde, for very griefe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one plaine word could speake.</P>
<P>And at their parting well they mighte<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In heart be grieved sore:<BR>
After that daye, faire Rosamonde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The king did see no more.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A></P>
<P>For when his Grace had past the seas,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And into France was gone,<BR>
With envious heart, Queene Ellinor<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Woodstocke came anone.</P>
<P>And forth she calls this trustye knighte<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unhappy houre,<BR>
Who, with his clue of twined-thread,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from this famous bower.</P>
<P>And when that they had wounded him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The queene this thread did gette,<BR>
And wente where Ladye Rosamonde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was like an angell sette.</P>
<P>But when the queene with stedfast eye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld her beauteous face,<BR>
She was amazed in her minde<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At her exceeding grace.</P>
<P>Cast off from thee those robes," she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That riche and costlye bee;<BR>
And drinke thou up this deadlye draught<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I have brought to thee."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_06600"></A>
<A HREF="img/06600.jpg"><IMG SRC="tn/06600.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=-3>Click to enlarge</FONT></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then presentlye upon her knees<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Rosamonde did falle;<BR>
And pardon of the queene she crav'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For her offences all.</P>
<P>"Take pitty on my youthfull yeares,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Faire Rosamonde did crye;<BR>
"And lett mee not with poison stronge<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforc&egrave;d bee to dye.</P>
<P>"I will renounce my sinfull life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in some cloyster bide;<BR>
Or else be banisht, if you please,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To range the world soe wide.</P>
<P>"And for the fault which I have done,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I was forc'd theretoe,<BR>
Preserve my life, and punish mee<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you thinke meet to doe."</P>
<P>And with these words, her lillie handes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrunge full often there;<BR>
And downe along her lovely face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did trickle many a teare.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A></P>
<P>But nothing could this furious queene<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith appeased bee;<BR>
The cup of deadlye poyson stronge,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As she knelt on her knee,</P>
<P>She gave this comelye dame to drinke;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who tooke it in her hand,<BR>
And from her bended knee arose,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her feet did stand,</P>
<P>And casting up her eyes to heaven,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shee did for mercye calle;<BR>
And drinking up the poison stronge,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her life she lost withalle.</P>
<P>And when that death through everye limbe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had showde its greatest spite,<BR>
Her chiefest foes did plain confesse<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shee was a glorious wight.</P>
<P>Her body then they did entomb,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When life was fled away,<BR>
At Godstowe, neare to Oxford towne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As may be seene this day.</P>
