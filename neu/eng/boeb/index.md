This collection of ballads contains some of the best known English folk
lyrics. It is nowhere near as comprehensive as other books, such as the
massive [Child ballad collection](../child/index). However, the
illustrations are gorgeous, and the selection is excellent. It should be
noted that 'Old English' in this case doesn't mean 'Anglo-Saxon';
strictly speaking these are written in late Middle or early Modern
English. This makes them accessible, even enjoyable, for a modern
audience.

Many of these are from the Scottish border, and deal with clashes
between the English and Scots in historical times. Others are set in an
idealized 'Old England', including three ballads of Robin Hood. The
ballads surprisingly feature well-constructed female characters, who are
participants in the action, not just part of the backdrop. These lyrics
give some insights, often grim in nature, into the culture and mindset
of the middle ages, particularly one (Hugh of Lincoln) with a
regrettable anti-Semitic theme.

Some of these ballads go on for dozens of verses, and form complete
short stories. If your only experience of these ballads is through
modern folk-song renditions, you owe it to yourself to sit down and get
the whole story.
