#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Friar's Tale

<span id="an_1301"></span> Whilom ther was dwellynge in my contree  
<span id="an_1302"></span> An erchedeken, a man of heigh degree,  
<span id="an_1303"></span> That boldely dide execucioun  
<span id="an_1304"></span> In punysshynge of fornicacioun,  
<span id="an_1305"></span> Of wicchecraft, and eek of bawderye,  
<span id="an_1306"></span> Of diffamacioun, and avowtrye,  
<span id="an_1307"></span> Of chirche reves, and of testamentz,  
<span id="an_1308"></span> Of contractes and of lakke of sacramentz,  
<span id="an_1309"></span> Of usure, and of symonye also.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1310">1310</span></span> But certes,
lecchours dide he grettest wo;  
<span id="an_1311"></span> They sholde syngen if that they were hent;  
<span id="an_1312"></span> And smale tytheres weren foule yshent,  
<span id="an_1313"></span> If any persoun wolde upon hem pleyne.  
<span id="an_1314"></span> Ther myghte asterte hym no pecunyal peyne.  
<span id="an_1315"></span> For smale tithes and for smal offrynge  
<span id="an_1316"></span> He made the peple pitously to synge,  
<span id="an_1317"></span> For er the bisshop caughte hem with his
hook,  
<span id="an_1318"></span> They weren in the erchedeknes book.  
<span id="an_1319"></span> Thanne hadde he, thurgh his jurisdiccioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1320">1320</span></span> Power to
doon on hem correccioun.  
<span id="an_1321"></span> He hadde a somonour redy to his hond;  
<span id="an_1322"></span> A slyer boye nas noon in Engelond;  
<span id="an_1323"></span> For subtilly he hadde his espiaille,  
<span id="an_1324"></span> That taughte hym wel wher that hym myghte
availle.  
<span id="an_1325"></span> He koude spare of lecchours oon or two,  
<span id="an_1326"></span> To techen hym to foure and twenty mo.  
<span id="an_1327"></span> For thogh this Somonour wood were as an
hare,  
<span id="an_1328"></span> To telle his harlotrye I wol nat spare;  
<span id="an_1329"></span> For we been out of his correccioun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1330">1330</span></span> They han of
us no jurisdiccioun,  
<span id="an_1331"></span> Ne nevere shullen, terme of alle hir lyves.  
<span id="an_1332"></span> "Peter! so been wommen of the styves,"  
<span id="an_1333"></span> Quod the Somonour, "yput out of oure cure!"  
<span id="an_1334"></span> "Pees! with myschance and with
mysaventure!"  
<span id="an_1335"></span> Thus seyde oure Hoost, "and lat hym telle his
tale.  
<span id="an_1336"></span> Now telleth forth, thogh that the Somonour
gale;  
<span id="an_1337"></span> Ne spareth nat, myn owene maister deere."  
<span id="an_1338"></span> This false theef, this somonour, quod the
Frere,  
<span id="an_1339"></span> Hadde alwey bawdes redy to his hond,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1340">1340</span></span> As any hauk
to lure in Engelond,  
<span id="an_1341"></span> That tolde hym al the secree that they
knewe,  
<span id="an_1342"></span> For hire acqueyntance was nat come of newe.  
<span id="an_1343"></span> They weren his approwours prively.  
<span id="an_1344"></span> He took hymself a greet profit therby;  
<span id="an_1345"></span> His maister knew nat alwey what he wan.  
<span id="an_1346"></span> Withouten mandement a lewed man  
<span id="an_1347"></span> He koude somne, on peyne of Cristes curs,  
<span id="an_1348"></span> And they were glade for to fille his purs  
<span id="an_1349"></span> And make hym grete feestes atte nale.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> And right
as Judas hadde purses smale,  
<span id="an_1351"></span> And was a theef, right swich a theef was
he;  
<span id="an_1352"></span> His maister hadde but half his duetee.  
<span id="an_1353"></span> He was, if I shal yeven hym his laude,  
<span id="an_1354"></span> A theef, and eek a somnour, and a baude.  
<span id="an_1355"></span> He hadde eek wenches at his retenue,  
<span id="an_1356"></span> That, wheither that sir Robert or sir Huwe,  
<span id="an_1357"></span> Or Jakke, or Rauf, or whoso that it were  
<span id="an_1358"></span> That lay by hem, they tolde it in his ere.  
<span id="an_1359"></span> Thus was the wenche and he of oon assent,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1360">1360</span></span> And he
wolde fecche a feyned mandement,  
<span id="an_1361"></span> And somne hem to chapitre bothe two,  
<span id="an_1362"></span> And pile the man, and lete the wenche go.  
<span id="an_1363"></span> Thanne wolde he seye, "Freend, I shal for thy
sake  
<span id="an_1364"></span> Do striken hire out of oure lettres blake;  
<span id="an_1365"></span> Thee thar namoore as in this cas travaille.  
<span id="an_1366"></span> I am thy freend, ther I thee may availle."  
<span id="an_1367"></span> Certeyn he knew of briberyes mo  
<span id="an_1368"></span> Than possible is to telle in yeres two.  
<span id="an_1369"></span> For in this world nys dogge for the bowe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1370">1370</span></span> That kan an
hurt deer from an hool yknowe  
<span id="an_1371"></span> Bet than this somnour knew a sly lecchour,  
<span id="an_1372"></span> Or an avowtier, or a paramour.  
<span id="an_1373"></span> And for that was the fruyt of al his rente,  
<span id="an_1374"></span> Therfore on it he sette al his entente.  
<span id="an_1375"></span> And so bifel that ones on a day  
<span id="an_1376"></span> This somnour, evere waityng on his pray,  
<span id="an_1377"></span> Rood for to somne an old wydwe, a ribibe,  
<span id="an_1378"></span> Feynynge a cause, for he wolde brybe.  
<span id="an_1379"></span> And happed that he saugh bifore hym ryde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1380">1380</span></span> A gay
yeman, under a forest syde.  
<span id="an_1381"></span> A bowe he bar, and arwes brighte and kene;  
<span id="an_1382"></span> He hadde upon a courtepy of grene,  
<span id="an_1383"></span> An hat upon his heed with frenges blake.  
<span id="an_1384"></span> "Sire," quod this somnour, "hayl, and wel

<span id="an_1385"></span> "Welcome," quod he, "and every good felawe!  
<span id="an_1386"></span> Wher rydestow, under this grene-wode

<span id="an_1387"></span> Seyde this yeman, "Wiltow fer to day?"  
<span id="an_1388"></span> This somnour hym answerde and seyde, "Nay;  
<span id="an_1389"></span> Heere faste by," quod he, "is myn entente  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1390">1390</span></span> To ryden,

<span id="an_1391"></span> That longeth to my lordes duetee."  
<span id="an_1392"></span> "Artow thanne a bailly?" "Ye," quod he.  
<span id="an_1393"></span> He dorste nat, for verray filthe and shame  
<span id="an_1394"></span> Seye that he was a somonour, for the name.  
<span id="an_1395"></span> "Depardieux," quod this yeman, "deere
broother,  
<span id="an_1396"></span> Thou art a bailly, and I am another.  
<span id="an_1397"></span> I am unknowen as in this contree;
