#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Squire's Tale

<span id="an_9"></span> At Sarray, in the land of Tartarye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Ther dwelte a
kyng that werreyed Russye,  
<span id="an_11"></span> Thurgh which ther dyde many a doughty man.  
<span id="an_12"></span> This noble kyng was cleped Cambyuskan,  
<span id="an_13"></span> Which in his tyme was of so greet renoun  
<span id="an_14"></span> That ther was nowher in no regioun  
<span id="an_15"></span> So excellent a lord in alle thyng:  
<span id="an_16"></span> Hym lakked noght that longeth to a kyng.  
<span id="an_17"></span> As of the secte of which that he was born  
<span id="an_18"></span> He kepte his lay, to which that he was sworn;  
<span id="an_19"></span> And therto he was hardy, wys, and riche,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> And pitous and
just, alwey yliche;  
<span id="an_21"></span> Sooth of his word, benigne, and honurable;  
<span id="an_22"></span> Of his corage as any centre stable;  
<span id="an_23"></span> Yong, fressh, and strong, in armes desirous  
<span id="an_24"></span> As any bacheler of al his hous.  
<span id="an_25"></span> A fair persone he was and fortunat,  
<span id="an_26"></span> And kept alwey so wel roial estat  
<span id="an_27"></span> That ther was nowher swich another man.  
<span id="an_28"></span> This noble kyng, this Tartre Cambyuskan,  
<span id="an_29"></span> Hadde two sones on Elpheta his wyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Of whiche the
eldeste highte Algarsyf;  
<span id="an_31"></span> That oother sone was cleped Cambalo.  
<span id="an_32"></span> A doghter hadde this worthy kyng also,  
<span id="an_33"></span> That yongest was, and highte Canacee.  
<span id="an_34"></span> But for to telle yow al hir beautee,  
<span id="an_35"></span> It lyth nat in my tonge, n' yn my konnyng;  
<span id="an_36"></span> I dar nat undertake so heigh a thyng.  
<span id="an_37"></span> Myn Englissh eek is insufficient.  
<span id="an_38"></span> It moste been a rethor excellent  
<span id="an_39"></span> That koude his colours longynge for that art,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> If he sholde
hire discryven every part.  
<span id="an_41"></span> I am noon swich, I moot speke as I kan.  
<span id="an_42"></span> And so bifel that whan this Cambyuskan  
<span id="an_43"></span> Hath twenty wynter born his diademe,  
<span id="an_44"></span> As he was wont fro yeer to yeer, I deme,  
<span id="an_45"></span> He leet the feeste of his nativitee  
<span id="an_46"></span> Doon cryen thurghout Sarray his citee,  
<span id="an_47"></span> The laste Idus of March, after the yeer.  
<span id="an_48"></span> Phebus the sonne ful joly was and cleer,  
<span id="an_49"></span> For he was neigh his exaltacioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> In Martes face
and in his mansioun  
<span id="an_51"></span> In Aries, the colerik hoote signe.  
<span id="an_52"></span> Ful lusty was the weder and benigne,  
<span id="an_53"></span> For which the foweles, agayn the sonne
sheene,  
<span id="an_54"></span> What for the sesoun and the yonge grene,  
<span id="an_55"></span> Ful loude songen hire affecciouns.  
<span id="an_56"></span> Hem semed han geten hem protecciouns  
<span id="an_57"></span> Agayn the swerd of wynter, keene and coold.  
<span id="an_58"></span> This Cambyuskan, of which I have yow toold,  
<span id="an_59"></span> In roial vestiment sit on his deys,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> With diademe,
ful heighe in his paleys,  
<span id="an_61"></span> And halt his feeste so solempne and so ryche  
<span id="an_62"></span> That in this world ne was ther noon it lyche;  
<span id="an_63"></span> Of which if I shal tellen al th' array,  
<span id="an_64"></span> Thanne wolde it occupie a someres day,  
<span id="an_65"></span> And eek it nedeth nat for to devyse  
<span id="an_66"></span> At every cours the ordre of hire servyse.  
<span id="an_67"></span> I wol nat tellen of hir strange sewes,  
<span id="an_68"></span> Ne of hir swannes, ne of hire heronsewes.  
<span id="an_69"></span> Eek in that lond, as tellen knyghtes olde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Ther is som
mete that is ful deynte holde  
<span id="an_71"></span> That in this lond men recche of it but smal;  
<span id="an_72"></span> Ther nys no man that may reporten al.  
<span id="an_73"></span> I wol nat taryen yow, for it is pryme  
<span id="an_74"></span> And for it is no fruyt but los of tyme;  
<span id="an_75"></span> Unto my firste I wole have my recours.  
<span id="an_76"></span> And so bifel that after the thridde cours,  
<span id="an_77"></span> Whil that this kyng sit thus in his nobleye,  
<span id="an_78"></span> Herknynge his mynstralles hir thynges pleye  
<span id="an_79"></span> Biforn hym at the bord deliciously,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> In at the halle
dore al sodeynly  
<span id="an_81"></span> Ther cam a knyght upon a steede of bras,  
<span id="an_82"></span> And in his hand a brood mirour of glas.  
<span id="an_83"></span> Upon his thombe he hadde of gold a ryng,  
<span id="an_84"></span> And by his syde a naked swerd hangyng;  
<span id="an_85"></span> And up he rideth to the heighe bord.  
<span id="an_86"></span> In al the halle ne was ther spoken a word  
<span id="an_87"></span> For merveille of this knyght; hym to biholde  
<span id="an_88"></span> Ful bisily they wayten, yonge and olde.  
<span id="an_89"></span> This strange knyght, that cam thus sodeynly,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Al armed, save
his heed, ful richely,  
<span id="an_91"></span> Saleweth kyng and queene and lordes alle,  
<span id="an_92"></span> By ordre, as they seten in the halle,  
<span id="an_93"></span> With so heigh reverence and obeisaunce,  
<span id="an_94"></span> As wel in speche as in contenaunce,  
<span id="an_95"></span> That Gawayn, with his olde curteisye,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Though he were comen ayeyn out of Fairye,  
<span id="an_97"></span> Ne koude hym nat amende with a word.  
<span id="an_98"></span> And after this, biforn the heighe bord,  
<span id="an_99"></span> He with a manly voys seide his message,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> After the
forme used in his langage,  
<span id="an_101"></span> Withouten vice of silable or of lettre;  
<span id="an_102"></span> And for his tale sholde seme the bettre,  
<span id="an_103"></span> Accordant to his wordes was his cheere,  
<span id="an_104"></span> As techeth art of speche hem that it leere.  
<span id="an_105"></span> Al be that I kan nat sowne his stile,  
<span id="an_106"></span> Ne kan nat clymben over so heigh a style,  
<span id="an_107"></span> Yet seye I this, as to commune entente:  
<span id="an_108"></span> Thus muche amounteth al that evere he mente,  
<span id="an_109"></span> If it so be that I have it in mynde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> He seyde,
"The kyng of Arabe and of Inde,  
<span id="an_111"></span> My lige lord, on this solempne day  
<span id="an_112"></span> Saleweth yow, as he best kan and may,

<span id="an_175"></span> This is to seyn, the swerd and the mirour --  
<span id="an_176"></span> And born anon into the heighe tour  
<span id="an_177"></span> With certeine officers ordeyned therfore;  
<span id="an_178"></span> And unto Canacee this ryng is bore  
<span id="an_179"></span> Solempnely, ther she sit at the table.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> But sikerly,
withouten any fable,  
<span id="an_181"></span> The hors of bras, that may nat be remewed,  
<span id="an_182"></span> It stant as it were to the ground yglewed.  
<span id="an_183"></span> Ther may no man out of the place it dryve  
<span id="an_184"></span> For noon engyn of wyndas or polyve;  
<span id="an_185"></span> And cause why? For they kan nat the craft.  
<span id="an_186"></span> And therfore in the place they han it laft  
<span id="an_187"></span> Til that the knyght hath taught hem the
manere  
<span id="an_188"></span> To voyden hym, as ye shal after heere.  
<span id="an_189"></span> Greet was the prees that swarmeth to and fro  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> To gauren on
this hors that stondeth so,  
<span id="an_191"></span> For it so heigh was, and so brood and long,  
<span id="an_192"></span> So wel proporcioned for to been strong,  
<span id="an_193"></span> Right as it were a steede of Lumbardye;  
<span id="an_194"></span> Therwith so horsly, and so quyk of ye,  
<span id="an_195"></span> As it a gentil Poilleys courser were.  
<span id="an_196"></span> For certes, fro his tayl unto his ere  
<span id="an_197"></span> Nature ne art ne koude hym nat amende  
<span id="an_198"></span> In no degree, as al the people wende.  
<span id="an_199"></span> But everemoore hir mooste wonder was  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> How that it
koude gon, and was of bras;  
<span id="an_201"></span> It was a fairye, as the peple semed.  
<span id="an_202"></span> Diverse folk diversely they demed;  
<span id="an_203"></span> As many heddes, as manye wittes ther been.  
<span id="an_204"></span> They murmureden as dooth a swarm of been,  
<span id="an_205"></span> And maden skiles after hir fantasies,  
<span id="an_206"></span> Rehersynge of thise olde poetries,  
<span id="an_207"></span> And seyden it was lyk the Pegasee,  
<span id="an_208"></span> The hors that hadde wynges for to flee;  
<span id="an_209"></span> Or elles it was the Grekes hors Synon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> That broghte
Troie to destruccion,  
<span id="an_211"></span> As men in thise olde geestes rede.  
<span id="an_212"></span> "Myn herte," quod oon, "is everemoore in

<span id="an_213"></span> I trowe som men of armes been therinne,  
<span id="an_214"></span> That shapen hem this citee for to wynne.  
<span id="an_215"></span> It were right good that al swich thyng were

<span id="an_216"></span> Another rowned to his felawe lowe,  
<span id="an_217"></span> And seyde, "He lyeth, for it is rather lyk  
<span id="an_218"></span> An apparence ymaad by som magyk,  
<span id="an_219"></span> As jogelours pleyen at thise feestes grete."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> Of sondry
doutes thus they jangle and trete,  
<span id="an_221"></span> As lewed peple demeth comunly  
<span id="an_222"></span> Of thynges that been maad moore subtilly  
<span id="an_223"></span> Than they kan in hir lewednesse comprehende;  
<span id="an_224"></span> They demen gladly to the badder ende.  
<span id="an_225"></span> And somme of hem wondred on the mirour,  
<span id="an_226"></span> That born was up into the maister-tour,  
<span id="an_227"></span> Hou men myghte in it swiche thynges se.  
<span id="an_228"></span> Another answerde and seyde it myghte wel be  
<span id="an_229"></span> Naturelly, by composiciouns  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> Of anglis and
of slye reflexiouns,  
<span id="an_231"></span> And seyde that in Rome was swich oon.  
<span id="an_232"></span> They speken of Alocen, and Vitulon,  
<span id="an_233"></span> And Aristotle, that writen in hir lyves  
<span id="an_234"></span> Of queynte mirours and of perspectives,  
<span id="an_235"></span> As knowen they that han hir bookes herd.  
<span id="an_236"></span> And oother folk han wondred on the swerd  
<span id="an_237"></span> That wolde percen thurghout every thyng,  
<span id="an_238"></span> And fille in speche of Thelophus the kyng,  
<span id="an_239"></span> And of Achilles with his queynte spere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> For he koude
with it bothe heele and dere,  
<span id="an_241"></span> Right in swich wise as men may with the
swerd  
<span id="an_242"></span> Of which right now ye han youreselven herd.  
<span id="an_243"></span> They speken of sondry hardyng of metal,  
<span id="an_244"></span> And speke of medicynes therwithal,  
<span id="an_245"></span> And how and whanne it sholde yharded be,  
<span id="an_246"></span> Which is unknowe, algates unto me.  
<span id="an_247"></span> Tho speeke they of Canacees ryng,  
<span id="an_248"></span> And seyden alle that swich a wonder thyng  
<span id="an_249"></span> Of craft of rynges herde they nevere noon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> Save that he
Moyses and kyng Salomon  
<span id="an_251"></span> Hadde a name of konnyng in swich art.  
<span id="an_252"></span> Thus seyn the peple and drawen hem apart.  
<span id="an_253"></span> But nathelees somme seiden that it was  
<span id="an_254"></span> Wonder to maken of fern-asshen glas,  
<span id="an_255"></span> And yet nys glas nat lyk asshen of fern;  
<span id="an_256"></span> But, for they han yknowen it so fern,  
<span id="an_257"></span> Therfore cesseth hir janglyng and hir
wonder.  
<span id="an_258"></span> As soore wondren somme on cause of thonder,  
<span id="an_259"></span> On ebbe, on flood, on gossomer, and on myst,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> And alle

<span id="an_261"></span> Thus jangle they, and demen, and devyse  
<span id="an_262"></span> Til that the kyng gan fro the bord aryse.  
<span id="an_263"></span> Phebus hath laft the angle meridional,  
<span id="an_264"></span> And yet ascendynge was the beest roial,  
<span id="an_265"></span> The gentil Leon, with his Aldiran,

<span id="an_271"></span> That it is lyk an hevene for to heere.  
<span id="an_272"></span> Now dauncen lusty Venus children deere,  
<span id="an_273"></span> For in the Fyssh hir lady sat ful hye,  
<span id="an_274"></span> And looketh on hem with a freendly ye.  
<span id="an_275"></span> This noble kyng is set upon his trone.

<span id="an_382"></span> Hire maistresse clepeth wommen a greet

<span id="an_383"></span> And up they rysen, wel a ten or twelve;  
<span id="an_384"></span> Up riseth fresshe Canacee hireselve,  
<span id="an_385"></span> As rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne,

<span id="an_387"></span> Noon hyer was he whan she redy was --  
<span id="an_388"></span> And forth she walketh esily a pas,  
<span id="an_389"></span> Arrayed after the lusty seson soote  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> Lightly, for
to pleye and walke on foote,  
<span id="an_391"></span> Nat but with fyve or sixe of hir meynee;  
<span id="an_392"></span> And in a trench forth in the park gooth she.  
<span id="an_393"></span> The vapour which that fro the erthe glood  
<span id="an_394"></span> Made the sonne to seme rody and brood;  
<span id="an_395"></span> But nathelees it was so fair a sighte  
<span id="an_396"></span> That it made alle hire hertes for to lighte,  
<span id="an_397"></span> What for the seson and the morwenynge,  
<span id="an_398"></span> And for the foweles that she herde synge.  
<span id="an_399"></span> For right anon she wiste what they mente  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> Right by hir

<span id="an_401"></span> The knotte why that every tale is toold,

<span id="an_405"></span> For fulsomnesse of his prolixitee;  
<span id="an_406"></span> And by the same resoun, thynketh me,  
<span id="an_407"></span> I sholde to the knotte condescende,  
<span id="an_408"></span> And maken of hir walkyng soone an ende.  
<span id="an_409"></span> Amydde a tree, for drye as whit as chalk,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> As Canacee
was pleyyng in hir walk,  
<span id="an_411"></span> Ther sat a faucon over hire heed ful hye,  
<span id="an_412"></span> That with a pitous voys so gan to crye  
<span id="an_413"></span> That all the wode resouned of hire cry.  
<span id="an_414"></span> Ybeten hadde she hirself so pitously  
<span id="an_415"></span> With bothe hir wynges til the rede blood  
<span id="an_416"></span> Ran endelong the tree ther-as she stood.  
<span id="an_417"></span> And evere in oon she cryde alwey and

<span id="an_418"></span> And with hir beek hirselven so she prighte  
<span id="an_419"></span> That ther nys tygre, ne noon so crueel beest

<span id="an_423"></span> For ther nas nevere yet no man on lyve,  
<span id="an_424"></span> If that I koude a faucon wel discryve,  
<span id="an_425"></span> That herde of swich another of fairnesse,  
<span id="an_426"></span> As wel of plumage as of gentillesse  
<span id="an_427"></span> Of shap, of al that myghte yrekened be.  
<span id="an_428"></span> A faucon peregryn thanne semed she  
<span id="an_429"></span> Of fremde land; and everemoore, as she

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> She swowneth
now and now for lak of blood,  
<span id="an_431"></span> Til wel neigh is she fallen fro the tree.  
<span id="an_432"></span> This faire kynges doghter, Canacee,  
<span id="an_433"></span> That on hir fynger baar the queynte ryng,  
<span id="an_434"></span> Thurgh which she understood wel every thyng  
<span id="an_435"></span> That any fowel may in his leden seyn,  
<span id="an_436"></span> And koude answeren hym in his ledene ageyn,  
<span id="an_437"></span> Hath understonde what this faucon seyde,  
<span id="an_438"></span> And wel neigh for the routhe almoost she
deyde.  
<span id="an_439"></span> And to the tree she gooth ful hastily,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> And on this
faukon looketh pitously,  
<span id="an_441"></span> And heeld hir lappe abrood, for wel she

<span id="an_442"></span> The faukon moste fallen fro the twiste,  
<span id="an_443"></span> Whan that it swowned next, for lak of blood.  
<span id="an_444"></span> A longe whil to wayten hire she stood  
<span id="an_445"></span> Til atte laste she spak in this manere  
<span id="an_446"></span> Unto the hauk, as ye shal after heere:  
<span id="an_447"></span> "What is the cause, if it be for to telle,  
<span id="an_448"></span> That ye be in this furial pyne of helle?"  
<span id="an_449"></span> Quod Canacee unto this hauk above.

cheere,  
<span id="an_546"></span> So lyk a gentil lovere of manere,  
<span id="an_547"></span> So ravysshed, as it semed, for the joye  
<span id="an_548"></span> That nevere Jason ne Parys of Troye --  
<span id="an_549"></span> Jason? certes, ne noon oother man  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> Syn Lameth
was, that alderfirst bigan  
<span id="an_551"></span> To loven two, as writen folk biforn --  
<span id="an_552"></span> Ne nevere, syn the firste man was born,  
<span id="an_553"></span> Ne koude man, by twenty thousand part,  
<span id="an_554"></span> Countrefete the sophymes of his art,  
<span id="an_555"></span> Ne were worthy unbokelen his galoche,  
<span id="an_556"></span> Ther doublenesse or feynyng sholde approche,  
<span id="an_557"></span> Ne so koude thonke a wight as he dide me!  
<span id="an_558"></span> His manere was an hevene for to see  
<span id="an_559"></span> Til any womman, were she never so wys,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> So peynted he
and kembde at point-devys  
<span id="an_561"></span> As wel his wordes as his contenaunce.  
<span id="an_562"></span> And I so loved hym for his obeisaunce,  
<span id="an_563"></span> And for the trouthe I demed in his herte,  
<span id="an_564"></span> That if so were that any thyng hym smerte,  
<span id="an_565"></span> Al were it never so lite, and I it wiste,  
<span id="an_566"></span> Me thoughte I felte deeth myn herte twiste.  
<span id="an_567"></span> And shortly, so ferforth this thyng is went  
<span id="an_568"></span> That my wyl was his willes instrument;  
<span id="an_569"></span> This is to seyn, my wyl obeyed his wyl  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> In alle
thyng, as fer as reson fil,  
<span id="an_571"></span> Kepynge the boundes of my worshipe evere.  
<span id="an_572"></span> Ne nevere hadde I thyng so lief, ne levere,  
<span id="an_573"></span> As hym, God woot, ne nevere shal namo.  
<span id="an_574"></span> "This laste lenger than a yeer or two,  
<span id="an_575"></span> That I supposed of hym noght but good.  
<span id="an_576"></span> But finally, thus atte laste it stood,  
<span id="an_577"></span> That Fortune wolde that he moste twynne  
<span id="an_578"></span> Out of that place which that I was inne.  
<span id="an_579"></span> Wher me was wo, that is no questioun;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> I kan nat
make of it discripsioun.  
<span id="an_581"></span> For o thyng dar I tellen boldely:  
<span id="an_582"></span> I knowe what is the peyne of deeth therby;  
<span id="an_583"></span> Swich harm I felte for he ne myghte bileve.  
<span id="an_584"></span> So on a day of me he took his leve,  
<span id="an_585"></span> So sorwefully eek that I wende verraily  
<span id="an_586"></span> That he had felt as muche harm as I,  
<span id="an_587"></span> Whan that I herde hym speke and saugh his
hewe.  
<span id="an_588"></span> But nathelees, I thoughte he was so trewe,  
<span id="an_589"></span> And eek that he repaire sholde ageyn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> Withinne a
litel while, sooth to seyn;  
<span id="an_591"></span> And resoun wolde eek that he moste go  
<span id="an_592"></span> For his honour, as ofte it happeth so,  
<span id="an_593"></span> That I made vertu of necessitee,  
<span id="an_594"></span> And took it wel, syn that it moste be.  
<span id="an_595"></span> As I best myghte, I hidde fro hym my sorwe,  
<span id="an_596"></span> And took hym by the hond, Seint John to
borwe,  
<span id="an_597"></span> And seyde hym thus: \`Lo, I am youres al;  
<span id="an_598"></span> Beth swich as I to yow have been and shal.'  
<span id="an_599"></span> What he answerde, it nedeth noght reherce;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> Who kan sey
bet than he, who kan do werse?  
<span id="an_601"></span> Whan he hath al wel seyd, thanne hath he
doon.  
<span id="an_602"></span> \`Therfore bihoveth hire a ful long spoon  
<span id="an_603"></span> That shal ete with a feend,' thus herde I
seye.  
<span id="an_604"></span> So atte laste he moste forth his weye,  
<span id="an_605"></span> And forth he fleeth til he cam ther hym
leste.  
<span id="an_606"></span> Whan it cam hym to purpos for to reste,  
<span id="an_607"></span> I trowe he hadde thilke text in mynde,  
<span id="an_608"></span> That \`alle thyng, repeirynge to his kynde,  
<span id="an_609"></span> Gladeth hymself;' thus seyn men, as I gesse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> Men loven of
propre kynde newefangelnesse,  
<span id="an_611"></span> As briddes doon that men in cages fede.  
<span id="an_612"></span> For though thou nyght and day take of hem
hede,  
<span id="an_613"></span> And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk,  
<span id="an_614"></span> And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk,  
<span id="an_615"></span> Yet right anon as that his dore is uppe  
<span id="an_616"></span> He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe,  
<span id="an_617"></span> And to the wode he wole and wormes ete;  
<span id="an_618"></span> So newefangel been they of hire mete,  
<span id="an_619"></span> And loven novelries of propre kynde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> No
gentillesse of blood ne may hem bynde.  
<span id="an_621"></span> "So ferde this tercelet, allas the day!  
<span id="an_622"></span> Though he were gentil born, and fressh and
gay,  
<span id="an_623"></span> And goodlich for to seen, and humble and
free,  
<span id="an_624"></span> He saugh upon a tyme a kyte flee,  
<span id="an_625"></span> And sodeynly he loved this kyte so  
<span id="an_626"></span> That al his love is clene fro me ago,  
<span id="an_627"></span> And hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse.  
<span id="an_628"></span> Thus hath the kyte my love in hire servyse,  
<span id="an_629"></span> And I am lorn withouten remedie!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> And with that
word this faucon gan to crie  
<span id="an_631"></span> And swowned eft in Canacees barm.  
<span id="an_632"></span> Greet was the sorwe for the haukes harm  
<span id="an_633"></span> That Canacee and alle hir wommen made;  
<span id="an_634"></span> They nyste hou they myghte the faucon glade.  
<span id="an_635"></span> But Canacee hom bereth hire in hir lappe,  
<span id="an_636"></span> And softely in plastres gan hire wrappe,  
<span id="an_637"></span> Ther as she with hire beek hadde hurt
hirselve.  
<span id="an_638"></span> Now kan nat Canacee but herbes delve  
<span id="an_639"></span> Out of the ground, and make salves newe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> Of herbes
preciouse and fyne of hewe  
<span id="an_641"></span> To heelen with this hauk. Fro day to nyght  
<span id="an_642"></span> She dooth hire bisynesse and al hire myght,  
<span id="an_643"></span> And by hire beddes heed she made a mewe  
<span id="an_644"></span> And covered it with veluettes blewe,  
<span id="an_645"></span> In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene.  
<span id="an_646"></span> And al withoute, the mewe is peynted grene,  
<span id="an_647"></span> In which were peynted alle thise false
fowles,  
<span id="an_648"></span> As ben thise tidyves, tercelettes, and
owles;  
<span id="an_649"></span> Right for despit were peynted hem bisyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> Pyes, on hem
for to crie and chyde.  
<span id="an_651"></span> Thus lete I Canacee hir hauk kepyng;  
<span id="an_652"></span> I wol namoore as now speke of hir ryng  
<span id="an_653"></span> Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn  
<span id="an_654"></span> How that this faucon gat hire love ageyn  
<span id="an_655"></span> Repentant, as the storie telleth us,  
<span id="an_656"></span> By mediacion of Cambalus,  
<span id="an_657"></span> The kynges sone, of which I yow tolde.  
<span id="an_658"></span> But hennesforth I wol my proces holde  
<span id="an_659"></span> To speken of aventures and of batailles  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> That nevere
yet was herd so grete mervailles.  
<span id="an_661"></span> First wol I telle yow of Cambyuskan,  
<span id="an_662"></span> That in his tyme many a citee wan;  
<span id="an_663"></span> And after wol I speke of Algarsif,  
<span id="an_664"></span> How that he wan Theodora to his wif,  
<span id="an_665"></span> For whom ful ofte in greet peril he was,  
<span id="an_666"></span> Ne hadde he ben holpen by the steede of
bras;  
<span id="an_667"></span> And after wol I speke of Cambalo,  
<span id="an_668"></span> That faught in lystes with the bretheren two  
<span id="an_669"></span> For Canacee er that he myghte hire wynne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> And ther I
lefte I wol ayeyn bigynne.  
<span id="an_671"></span> Appollo whirleth up his chaar so hye  
<span id="an_672"></span> Til that the god Mercurius hous, the slye --  
<span id="an_673"></span> "In feith, Squier, thow hast thee wel yquit  
<span id="an_674"></span> And gentilly. I preise wel thy wit,"  
<span id="an_675"></span> Quod the Frankeleyn, "considerynge thy

<span id="an_676"></span> So feelyngly thou spekest, sire, I allow

<span id="an_677"></span> As to my doom, ther is noon that is heere  
<span id="an_678"></span> Of eloquence that shal be thy peere,  
<span id="an_679"></span> If that thou lyve; God yeve thee good

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> And in vertu
sende thee continuaunce,  
<span id="an_681"></span> For of thy speche I have greet deyntee.  
<span id="an_682"></span> I have a sone, and by the Trinitee,  
<span id="an_683"></span> I hadde levere than twenty pound worth lond,  
<span id="an_684"></span> Though it right now were fallen in myn hond,

<span id="an_692"></span> And he hath levere talken with a page
