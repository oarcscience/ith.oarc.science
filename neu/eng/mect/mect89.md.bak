#### The Romaunt of the Rose

### Fragment A

<span id="an_1"></span> Many men sayn that in sweveninges  
<span id="an_2"></span> Ther nys but fables and lesynges;  
<span id="an_3"></span> But men may some sweven\[es\] sen  
<span id="an_4"></span> Whiche hardely that false ne ben,  
<span id="an_5"></span> But afterward ben apparaunt.  
<span id="an_6"></span> This may I drawe to warraunt  
<span id="an_7"></span> An authour that hight Macrobes,  
<span id="an_8"></span> That halt nat dremes false ne lees,  
<span id="an_9"></span> But undoth us the avysioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> That whilom
mette kyng Cipioun.  
<span id="an_11"></span> And whoso saith or weneth it be  
<span id="an_12"></span> A jape, or elles nycete,  
<span id="an_13"></span> To wene that dremes after falle,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Let whoso lyste a fol me calle.  
<span id="an_15"></span> For this trowe I, and say for me,  
<span id="an_16"></span> That dremes signifiaunce be  
<span id="an_17"></span> Of good and harm to many wightes  
<span id="an_18"></span> That dremen in her slep a-nyghtes  
<span id="an_19"></span> Ful many thynges covertly  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> That fallen
after al openly.  
<span id="an_21"></span> Within my twenty yer of age,  
<span id="an_22"></span> Whan that Love taketh his cariage  
<span id="an_23"></span> Of yonge folk, I wente soone  
<span id="an_24"></span> To bedde, as I was wont to done,  
<span id="an_25"></span> And faste I slepte; and in slepyng  
<span id="an_26"></span> Me mette such a swevenyng  
<span id="an_27"></span> That lyked me wonders wel.  
<span id="an_28"></span> But in that sweven is never a del  
<span id="an_29"></span> That it nys afterward befalle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Ryght as this
drem wol tel us alle.  
<span id="an_31"></span> Now this drem wol I ryme aright  
<span id="an_32"></span> To make your hertes gaye and lyght,  
<span id="an_33"></span> For Love it prayeth, and also  
<span id="an_34"></span> Commaundeth me that it be so.  
<span id="an_35"></span> And if there any aske me,  
<span id="an_36"></span> Whether that it be he or she,  
<span id="an_37"></span> How this book, which is here,  
<span id="an_38"></span> Shal hatte, that I rede you here:  
<span id="an_39"></span> It is the Romance of the Rose,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> In which al the
art of love I close.  
<span id="an_41"></span> The mater fayre is of to make;  
<span id="an_42"></span> God graunt me in gree that she it take  
<span id="an_43"></span> For whom that it begonnen is.  
<span id="an_44"></span> And that is she that hath, ywis,  
<span id="an_45"></span> So mochel pris, and therto she  
<span id="an_46"></span> So worthy is biloved to be,  
<span id="an_47"></span> That she wel ought, of pris and ryght,  
<span id="an_48"></span> Be cleped Rose of every wight.  
<span id="an_49"></span> That it was May me thoughte tho  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> It is fyve yer
or more ago  
<span id="an_51"></span> That it was May, thus dremed me,  
<span id="an_52"></span> In tyme of love and jolite,  
<span id="an_53"></span> That al thing gynneth waxen gay,  
<span id="an_54"></span> For ther is neither busk nor hay  
<span id="an_55"></span> In May that it nyl shrouded ben  
<span id="an_56"></span> And it with newe leves wren.  
<span id="an_57"></span> These wodes eek recoveren grene,  
<span id="an_58"></span> That drie in wynter ben to sene,  
<span id="an_59"></span> And the erthe wexith proud withalle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> For swote dewes
that on it falle,  
<span id="an_61"></span> And the pore estat forget  
<span id="an_62"></span> In which that wynter had it set.  
<span id="an_63"></span> And than bycometh the ground so proud  
<span id="an_64"></span> That it wole have a newe shroud,  
<span id="an_65"></span> And makith so queynt his robe and faire  
<span id="an_66"></span> That it hath hewes an hundred payre  
<span id="an_67"></span> Of gras and flouris, ynde and pers,  
<span id="an_68"></span> And many hewes ful dyvers  
<span id="an_69"></span> That is the robe I mene, iwys,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Through which
the ground to preisen is.  
<span id="an_71"></span> The briddes that haven left her song,  
<span id="an_72"></span> While thei suffride cold so strong,  
<span id="an_73"></span> In wedres gryl and derk to sighte,  
<span id="an_74"></span> Ben in May for the sonne brighte  
<span id="an_75"></span> So glade that they shewe in syngyng  
<span id="an_76"></span> That in her hertis is sich lykyng  
<span id="an_77"></span> That they mote syngen and be light.  
<span id="an_78"></span> Than doth the nyghtyngale hir myght  
<span id="an_79"></span> To make noyse and syngen blythe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> Than is blisful
many sithe  
<span id="an_81"></span> The chelaundre and papyngay,  
<span id="an_82"></span> Than yonge folk entenden ay  
<span id="an_83"></span> Forto ben gay and amorous  
<span id="an_84"></span> The tyme is than so saverous.  
<span id="an_85"></span> Hard is the hert that loveth nought  
<span id="an_86"></span> In May whan al this mirth is wrought,  
<span id="an_87"></span> Whan he may on these braunches here  
<span id="an_88"></span> The smale briddes syngen clere  
<span id="an_89"></span> Her blisful swete song pitous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> And in this
sesoun delytous,  
<span id="an_91"></span> Whan love affraieth alle thing,  
<span id="an_92"></span> Me thought a-nyght in my sleping,  
<span id="an_93"></span> Right in my bed, ful redily,  
<span id="an_94"></span> That it was by the morowe erly,  
<span id="an_95"></span> And up I roos and gan me clothe.  
<span id="an_96"></span> Anoon I wissh myn hondis bothe.  
<span id="an_97"></span> A sylvre nedle forth I drough  
<span id="an_98"></span> Out of an aguler queynt ynough,  
<span id="an_99"></span> And gan this nedle threde anon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> For out of
toun me list to gon  
<span id="an_101"></span> The song of briddes forto here  
<span id="an_102"></span> That in thise buskes syngen clere.  
<span id="an_103"></span> And in \[the\] swete seson that leef is,  
<span id="an_104"></span> With a thred bastyng my slevis,  
<span id="an_105"></span> Alone I wente in my plaiyng,  
<span id="an_106"></span> The smale foules song harknyng.  
<span id="an_107"></span> They peyned hem, ful many peyre,  
<span id="an_108"></span> To synge on bowes blosmed feyre.  
<span id="an_109"></span> Joly and gay, ful of gladnesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Toward a
ryver gan I me dresse  
<span id="an_111"></span> That I herd renne faste by,  
<span id="an_112"></span> For fairer plaiyng non saugh I  
<span id="an_113"></span> Than playen me by that ryver.  
<span id="an_114"></span> For from an hill that stood ther ner  
<span id="an_115"></span> Cam doun the strem ful stif and bold.  
<span id="an_116"></span> Cleer was the water, and as cold  
<span id="an_117"></span> As any welle is, soth to seyne,  
<span id="an_118"></span> And somdel lasse it was than Seyne,  
<span id="an_119"></span> But it was strayghter wel away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> And never
saugh I, er that day,  
<span id="an_121"></span> The watir that so wel lyked me,  
<span id="an_122"></span> And wondir glad was I to se  
<span id="an_123"></span> That lusty place and that ryver.  
<span id="an_124"></span> And with that watir, that ran so cler,  
<span id="an_125"></span> My face I wyssh. Tho saugh I well  
<span id="an_126"></span> The botme paved everydell  
<span id="an_127"></span> With gravel, ful of stones shene.  
<span id="an_128"></span> The medewe softe, swote, and grene,  
<span id="an_129"></span> Beet right on the watir syde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Ful cler was
than the morowtyde,  
<span id="an_131"></span> And ful attempre, out of drede.  
<span id="an_132"></span> Tho gan I walke thorough the mede,  
<span id="an_133"></span> Dounward ay in my pleiyng,  
<span id="an_134"></span> The ryver syde costeiyng.  
<span id="an_135"></span> And whan I had a while goon,  
<span id="an_136"></span> I saugh a gardyn right anoon,  
<span id="an_137"></span> Ful long and brood, and everydell  
<span id="an_138"></span> Enclosed was, and walled well  
<span id="an_139"></span> With highe walles enbatailled,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Portraied
without and wel entailled  
<span id="an_141"></span> With many riche portraitures.  
<span id="an_142"></span> And bothe the ymages and the peyntures  
<span id="an_143"></span> Gan I biholde bysyly,  
<span id="an_144"></span> And I wole telle you redyly  
<span id="an_145"></span> Of thilk ymages the semblaunce,  
<span id="an_146"></span> As fer as I have in remembraunce.  
<span id="an_147"></span> Amydde saugh I Hate stonde,  
<span id="an_148"></span> That for hir wrathe, yre, and onde,  
<span id="an_149"></span> Semede to ben a mynoresse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> An angry
wight, a chideresse;  
<span id="an_151"></span> And ful of gyle and fel corage,  
<span id="an_152"></span> By semblaunt, was that ilk ymage.  
<span id="an_153"></span> And she was nothyng wel arraied,  
<span id="an_154"></span> But lyk a wod womman afraied.  
<span id="an_155"></span> Frounced foule was hir visage,  
<span id="an_156"></span> And grennyng for dispitous rage,  
<span id="an_157"></span> Hir nose snorted up for tene.  
<span id="an_158"></span> Ful hidous was she for to sene,  
<span id="an_159"></span> Ful foul and rusty was she, this.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> Hir heed
writhen was, ywis,  
<span id="an_161"></span> Ful grymly with a greet towayle.  
<span id="an_162"></span> An ymage of another entayle  
<span id="an_163"></span> A lyft half was hir faste by.  
<span id="an_164"></span> Hir name above hir heed saugh I,  
<span id="an_165"></span> And she was called Felonye.  
<span id="an_166"></span> Another ymage that Vilanye  
<span id="an_167"></span> Clepid was saugh I and fond  
<span id="an_168"></span> Upon the wal on hir right hond.  
<span id="an_169"></span> Vilany was lyk somdell  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> That other
ymage, and, trustith wel,  
<span id="an_171"></span> She semede a wikked creature.  
<span id="an_172"></span> By countenaunce in portrayture  
<span id="an_173"></span> She semed be ful dispitous,  
<span id="an_174"></span> And eek ful proud and outragious.  
<span id="an_175"></span> Wel coude he peynte, I undirtake,  
<span id="an_176"></span> That sich ymage coude make.  
<span id="an_177"></span> Ful foul and cherlyssh semed she,  
<span id="an_178"></span> And eek vylayneus for to be,  
<span id="an_179"></span> And litel coude of norture  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> To worshipe
any creature.  
<span id="an_181"></span> And next was peynted Coveitise,  
<span id="an_182"></span> That eggith folk in many gise  
<span id="an_183"></span> To take and yeve right nought ageyn,  
<span id="an_184"></span> And gret tresouris up to leyn.  
<span id="an_185"></span> And that is she that for usure  
<span id="an_186"></span> Leneth to many a creature  
<span id="an_187"></span> The lasse for the more wynnyng,  
<span id="an_188"></span> So coveitous is her brennyng.  
<span id="an_189"></span> And that is she that penyes fele  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> Techith for
to robbe and stele  
<span id="an_191"></span> These theves and these smale harlotes;  
<span id="an_192"></span> And that is routh, for by her throtes  
<span id="an_193"></span> Ful many oon hangith at the laste.  
<span id="an_194"></span> She makith folk compasse and caste  
<span id="an_195"></span> To taken other folkis thyng  
<span id="an_196"></span> Thorough robberie or myscounting.  
<span id="an_197"></span> And that is she that makith trechoures,  
<span id="an_198"></span> And she makith false pleadoures  
<span id="an_199"></span> That with hir termes and hir domes  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Doon maydens,
children, and eek gromes  
<span id="an_201"></span> Her heritage to forgo.  
<span id="an_202"></span> Ful croked were hir hondis two,  
<span id="an_203"></span> For Coveitise is evere wod  
<span id="an_204"></span> To gripen other folkis god.  
<span id="an_205"></span> Coveityse, for hir wynnyng,  
<span id="an_206"></span> Ful leef hath other mennes thing.  
<span id="an_207"></span> Another ymage set saugh I  
<span id="an_208"></span> Next Coveitise faste by,  
<span id="an_209"></span> And she was clepid Avarice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> Ful foul in
peyntyng was that vice;  
<span id="an_211"></span> Ful fade and caytif was she eek,  
<span id="an_212"></span> And also grene as ony leek.  
<span id="an_213"></span> So yvel hewed was hir colour,  
<span id="an_214"></span> Hir semed to have lyved in langour.  
<span id="an_215"></span> She was lyk thyng for hungre deed,  
<span id="an_216"></span> That ladde hir lyf oonly by breed  
<span id="an_217"></span> Kneden with eisel strong and egre,  
<span id="an_218"></span> And therto she was lene and megre.  
<span id="an_219"></span> And she was clad ful porely  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> Al in an old
torn courtepy,  
<span id="an_221"></span> As she were al with doggis torn;  
<span id="an_222"></span> And bothe bihynde and eke biforn  
<span id="an_223"></span> Clouted was she beggarly.  
<span id="an_224"></span> A mantyl heng hir faste by,  
<span id="an_225"></span> Upon a perche, weik and small;  
<span id="an_226"></span> A burnet cote heng therwithall  
<span id="an_227"></span> Furred with no menyver,  
<span id="an_228"></span> But with a furre rough of her,  
<span id="an_229"></span> Of lambe-skynnes hevy and blake.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> It was ful
old, I undirtake,  
<span id="an_231"></span> For Avarice to clothe hir well  
<span id="an_232"></span> Ne hastith hir never a dell.  
<span id="an_233"></span> For certeynly it were hir loth  
<span id="an_234"></span> To weren ofte that ilke cloth,  
<span id="an_235"></span> And if it were forwered, she  
<span id="an_236"></span> Wolde have ful gret necessite  
<span id="an_237"></span> Of clothyng er she bought hir newe,  
<span id="an_238"></span> Al were it bad of woll and hewe.  
<span id="an_239"></span> This Avarice hild in hir hand  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> A purs that
heng by a band,  
<span id="an_241"></span> And that she hidde and bond so stronge,  
<span id="an_242"></span> Men must abyde wondir longe  
<span id="an_243"></span> Out of that purs er ther come ought.  
<span id="an_244"></span> For that ne cometh not in hir thought;  
<span id="an_245"></span> It was not, certein, hir entente  
<span id="an_246"></span> That fro that purs a peny wente.  
<span id="an_247"></span> And by that ymage, nygh ynough,  
<span id="an_248"></span> Was peynted Envye, that never lough  
<span id="an_249"></span> Nor never wel in hir herte ferde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> But if she
outher saugh or herde  
<span id="an_251"></span> Som gret myschaunce or gret disese.  
<span id="an_252"></span> Nothyng may so moch hir plese  
<span id="an_253"></span> As myschef and mysaventure,  
<span id="an_254"></span> Or whan she seeth discomfiture  
<span id="an_255"></span> Upon ony worthy man falle,  
<span id="an_256"></span> Than likith hir wel withalle.  
<span id="an_257"></span> She is ful glad in hir corage,  
<span id="an_258"></span> If she se any gret lynage  
<span id="an_259"></span> Be brought to nought in shamful wise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> And if a man
in honour rise,  
<span id="an_261"></span> Or by his wit or by his prowesse,  
<span id="an_262"></span> Of that hath she gret hevynesse.  
<span id="an_263"></span> For, trustith wel, she goth nygh wod  
<span id="an_264"></span> Whan any chaunce happith god.  
<span id="an_265"></span> Envie is of such crueltee  
<span id="an_266"></span> That feith ne trouthe holdith she  
<span id="an_267"></span> To freend ne felawe, bad or good.  
<span id="an_268"></span> Ne she hath kyn noon of hir blood,  
<span id="an_269"></span> That she nys ful her enemy;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> She nolde, I
dar seyn hardely,  
<span id="an_271"></span> Hir owne fadir ferde well.  
<span id="an_272"></span> And sore abieth she everydell  
<span id="an_273"></span> Hir malice and hir maltalent,  
<span id="an_274"></span> For she is in so gret turment,  
<span id="an_275"></span> And hath such \[wo\] whan folk doth good  
<span id="an_276"></span> That nygh she meltith for pure wood.  
<span id="an_277"></span> Hir herte kervyth and so brekith  
<span id="an_278"></span> That God the puple wel awrekith.  
<span id="an_279"></span> Envie, iwis, shal nevere lette  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> Som blame
upon the folk to sette.  
<span id="an_281"></span> I trowe that if Envie, iwis,  
<span id="an_282"></span> Knewe the beste man that is  
<span id="an_283"></span> On this side or biyonde the see,  
<span id="an_284"></span> Yit somwhat lakken hym wolde she;  
<span id="an_285"></span> And if he were so hende and wis  
<span id="an_286"></span> That she ne myght al abate his pris,  
<span id="an_287"></span> Yit wolde she blame his worthynesse  
<span id="an_288"></span> Or by hir wordis make it lesse.  
<span id="an_289"></span> I saugh Envie in that peyntyng  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> Hadde a
wondirful lokyng,  
<span id="an_291"></span> For she ne lokide but awry  
<span id="an_292"></span> Or overthwart, all baggyngly.  
<span id="an_293"></span> And she hadde a \[foul\] usage:  
<span id="an_294"></span> She myght loke in no visage  
<span id="an_295"></span> Of man or womman forth-right pleyn,  
<span id="an_296"></span> But shette hir \[oon\] eie for disdeyn.  
<span id="an_297"></span> So for envie brenned she  
<span id="an_298"></span> Whan she myght any man se  
<span id="an_299"></span> That fair or worthi were, or wis,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> Or elles stod
in folkis prys.  
<span id="an_301"></span> Sorowe was peynted next Envie  
<span id="an_302"></span> Upon that wall of masonrye.  
<span id="an_303"></span> But wel was seyn in hir colour  
<span id="an_304"></span> That she hadde lyved in langour;  
<span id="an_305"></span> Hir semede to have the jaunyce.  
<span id="an_306"></span> Nought half so pale was Avarice,  
<span id="an_307"></span> Nor nothyng lyk of lenesse;  
<span id="an_308"></span> For sorowe, thought, and gret distresse,  
<span id="an_309"></span> That she hadde suffred day and nyght,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310">310</span></span> Made hir ful
yelow and nothyng bright,  
<span id="an_311"></span> Ful fade, pale, and megre also.  
<span id="an_312"></span> Was never wight yit half so wo  
<span id="an_313"></span> As that hir semede for to be,  
<span id="an_314"></span> Nor so fulfilled of ire as she.  
<span id="an_315"></span> I trowe that no wight myght hir please  
<span id="an_316"></span> Nor do that thyng that myght hir ease;  
<span id="an_317"></span> Nor she ne wolde hir sorowe slake,  
<span id="an_318"></span> Nor comfort noon unto hir take,  
<span id="an_319"></span> So depe was hir wo bigonnen,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> And eek hir
hert in angre ronnen.  
<span id="an_321"></span> A sorowful thyng wel semed she,  
<span id="an_322"></span> Nor she hadde nothyng slowe be  
<span id="an_323"></span> For to forcracchen al hir face,  
<span id="an_324"></span> And for to rent in many place  
<span id="an_325"></span> Hir clothis, and for to tere hir swire,  
<span id="an_326"></span> As she that was fulfilled of ire.  
<span id="an_327"></span> And al totorn lay eek hir her  
<span id="an_328"></span> Aboute hir shuldris here and ther,  
<span id="an_329"></span> As she that hadde it al torent  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> For angre and
for maltalent.  
<span id="an_331"></span> And eek I telle you certeynly  
<span id="an_332"></span> How that she wep ful tendirly.  
<span id="an_333"></span> In world nys wight so hard of herte  
<span id="an_334"></span> That hadde sen her sorowes smerte,  
<span id="an_335"></span> That nolde have had of her pyte,  
<span id="an_336"></span> So wo-begon a thyng was she.  
<span id="an_337"></span> She al todassht herself for woo  
<span id="an_338"></span> And smot togyder her hondes two.  
<span id="an_339"></span> To sorowe was she ful ententyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> That woful
recheles caytyf.  
<span id="an_341"></span> Her roughte lytel of playing  
<span id="an_342"></span> Or of clypping or kissyng;  
<span id="an_343"></span> For whoso sorouful is in herte,  
<span id="an_344"></span> Him luste not to play ne sterte,  
<span id="an_345"></span> Ne for to dauncen, ne to synge,  
<span id="an_346"></span> Ne may his herte in temper bringe  
<span id="an_347"></span> To make joye on even or morowe,  
<span id="an_348"></span> For joy is contrarie unto sorowe.  
<span id="an_349"></span> Elde was paynted after this,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> That shorter
was a foot, iwys,  
<span id="an_351"></span> Than she was wont in her yonghede.  
<span id="an_352"></span> Unneth herself she mighte fede.  
<span id="an_353"></span> So feble and eke so old was she  
<span id="an_354"></span> That faded was al her beaute.  
<span id="an_355"></span> Ful salowe was waxen her colour;  
<span id="an_356"></span> Her heed, for hor, was whyt as flour.  
<span id="an_357"></span> Iwys, great qualm ne were it non,  
<span id="an_358"></span> Ne synne, although her lyf were gon.  
<span id="an_359"></span> Al woxen was her body unwelde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> And drie and
dwyned al for elde.  
<span id="an_361"></span> A foul, forwelked thyng was she,  
<span id="an_362"></span> That whylom round and softe had be.  
<span id="an_363"></span> Her eeres shoken faste withalle,  
<span id="an_364"></span> As from her heed they wolde falle;  
<span id="an_365"></span> Her face frounced and forpyned,  
<span id="an_366"></span> And bothe her hondes lorne, fordwyned.  
<span id="an_367"></span> So old she was that she ne wente  
<span id="an_368"></span> A foot, but it were by potente.  
<span id="an_369"></span> The tyme that passeth nyght and day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> And resteles
travayleth ay,  
<span id="an_371"></span> And steleth from us so prively

<span id="an_373"></span> That it in oon poynt dwelleth ever  
<span id="an_374"></span> And certes, it ne resteth never,  
<span id="an_375"></span> But goth so faste, and passeth ay,  
<span id="an_376"></span> That ther nys man that thynke may  
<span id="an_377"></span> What tyme that now present is  
<span id="an_378"></span> (Asketh at these clerkes this),  
<span id="an_379"></span> For \[er\] men thynke it, redily  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> Thre tymes
ben passed by  
<span id="an_381"></span> The tyme, that may not sojourne,  
<span id="an_382"></span> But goth and may never retourne,  
<span id="an_383"></span> As watir that doun renneth ay,  
<span id="an_384"></span> But never drope retourne may;  
<span id="an_385"></span> Ther may nothing as tyme endure,  
<span id="an_386"></span> Metall nor erthely creature,  
<span id="an_387"></span> For alle thing it fret and shall;  
<span id="an_388"></span> The tyme eke that chaungith all,  
<span id="an_389"></span> And all doth waxe and fostred be,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> And alle
thing distroieth he;  
<span id="an_391"></span> The tyme that eldith our auncessours,  
<span id="an_392"></span> And eldith kynges and emperours,  
<span id="an_393"></span> And that us alle shal overcomen,  
<span id="an_394"></span> Er that deth us shal have nomen;  
<span id="an_395"></span> The tyme that hath al in welde  
<span id="an_396"></span> To elden folk had maad hir elde  
<span id="an_397"></span> So ynly that, to my witing,  
<span id="an_398"></span> She myghte helpe hirsilf nothing,  
<span id="an_399"></span> But turned ageyn unto childhede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> She had
nothing hirsilf to lede,  
<span id="an_401"></span> Ne wit ne pithe in hir hold,  
<span id="an_402"></span> More than a child of two yeer old.  
<span id="an_403"></span> But natheles, I trowe that she  
<span id="an_404"></span> Was fair sumtyme, and fresh to se,  
<span id="an_405"></span> Whan she was in hir rightful age,  
<span id="an_406"></span> But she was past al that passage,  
<span id="an_407"></span> And was a doted thing bicomen.  
<span id="an_408"></span> A furred cope on had she nomen;  
<span id="an_409"></span> Wel had she clad hirsilf and warm,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> For cold
myght elles don hir harm.  
<span id="an_411"></span> These olde folk have alwey cold;  
<span id="an_412"></span> Her kynde is sich, whan they ben old.  
<span id="an_413"></span> Another thing was don there write  
<span id="an_414"></span> That semede lyk an ipocrite,  
<span id="an_415"></span> And it was clepid Poope-Holy.  
<span id="an_416"></span> That ilk is she that pryvely  
<span id="an_417"></span> Ne spareth never a wikked dede,  
<span id="an_418"></span> Whan men of hir taken noon hede,  
<span id="an_419"></span> And maketh hir outward precious,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> With pale
visage and pitous,  
<span id="an_421"></span> And semeth a simple creature;  
<span id="an_422"></span> But ther nys no mysaventure  
<span id="an_423"></span> That she ne thenkith in hir corage.  
<span id="an_424"></span> Ful lyk to hir was that ymage,  
<span id="an_425"></span> That makid was lyk hir semblaunce.  
<span id="an_426"></span> She was ful symple of countenaunce,  
<span id="an_427"></span> And she was clothed and eke shod  
<span id="an_428"></span> As she were, for the love of God,  
<span id="an_429"></span> Yolden to relygioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> Sich semede

<span id="an_431"></span> A sauter held she fast in honde,  
<span id="an_432"></span> And bisily she gan to fonde  
<span id="an_433"></span> To make many a feynt praiere  
<span id="an_434"></span> To God and to his seyntis dere.  
<span id="an_435"></span> Ne she was gay, ne fresh, ne jolyf,  
<span id="an_436"></span> But semede to be ful ententyf  
<span id="an_437"></span> To gode werkis and to faire,  
<span id="an_438"></span> And therto she had on an haire.  
<span id="an_439"></span> Ne, certis, she was fatt nothing,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> But semed
wery for fasting;  
<span id="an_441"></span> Of colour pale and deed was she.  
<span id="an_442"></span> From hir the gate ay werned be  
<span id="an_443"></span> Of paradys, that blisful place;  
<span id="an_444"></span> For sich folk maketh lene her face,  
<span id="an_445"></span> As Crist seith in his evangile,  
<span id="an_446"></span> To gete hem prys in toun a while;  
<span id="an_447"></span> And for a litel glorie veine  
<span id="an_448"></span> They lesen God and his reigne.  
<span id="an_449"></span> And alderlast of everychon  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> Was peynted
Povert al aloon,  
<span id="an_451"></span> That not a peny hadde in wolde,  
<span id="an_452"></span> All though she hir clothis solde,  
<span id="an_453"></span> And though she shulde anhonged be,  
<span id="an_454"></span> For nakid as a worm was she.  
<span id="an_455"></span> And if the wedir stormy were,  
<span id="an_456"></span> For cold she shulde have deyed there.  
<span id="an_457"></span> She nadde on but a streit old sak,  
<span id="an_458"></span> And many a clout on it ther stak:  
<span id="an_459"></span> This was hir cote and hir mantell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> No more was
there, never a dell,  
<span id="an_461"></span> To clothe hir with, I undirtake;  
<span id="an_462"></span> Gret leyser hadde she to quake.  
<span id="an_463"></span> And she was putt, that I of talke,  
<span id="an_464"></span> Fer fro these other, up in an halke.  
<span id="an_465"></span> There lurked and there coured she,  
<span id="an_466"></span> For pover thing, whereso it be,  
<span id="an_467"></span> Is shamefast and dispised ay.  
<span id="an_468"></span> Acursed may wel be that day  
<span id="an_469"></span> That povere man conceyved is.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> For, God wot,
al to selde, iwys,  
<span id="an_471"></span> Is ony povere man wel fed,  
<span id="an_472"></span> Or wel araied or \[wel\] cled,

<span id="an_474"></span> In honour that he may arise.  
<span id="an_475"></span> Alle these thingis, well avised,  
<span id="an_476"></span> As I have you er this devysed,  
<span id="an_477"></span> With gold and asure over all  
<span id="an_478"></span> Depeynted were upon the wall.  
<span id="an_479"></span> Square was the wall, and high sumdell;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> Enclosed and
barred well,  
<span id="an_481"></span> In stede of hegge, was that gardyn;  
<span id="an_482"></span> Com nevere shepherde theryn.  
<span id="an_483"></span> Into that gardyn, wel wrought,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> The gardeyn

<span id="an_491"></span> To herberwe briddes many oon.  
<span id="an_492"></span> So riche a yer\[d\] was never noon

<span id="an_496"></span> Ful blisful was the accordaunce

<span id="an_655"></span> For there was many a bridd syngyng,  
<span id="an_656"></span> Thoroughout the yerd al thringyng;  
<span id="an_657"></span> In many places were nyghtyngales,

<span id="an_677"></span> Sich swete song was hem among  
<span id="an_678"></span> That me thought it no briddis song,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> Song of

<span id="an_681"></span> That, for her syngyng is so clere,

<span id="an_686"></span> These briddis, that nought unkunnynge  
<span id="an_687"></span> Were of her craft, and apprentys,  
<span id="an_688"></span> But of song sotil and wys.  
<span id="an_689"></span> And certis, whan I herde her song,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> And saw the
grene place among,  
<span id="an_691"></span> In herte I wex so wondir gay

<span id="an_694"></span> Ne merye in herte, as I was thoo.  
<span id="an_695"></span> And than wist I and saw ful well

<span id="an_711"></span> But, as I may and can, I shall  
<span id="an_712"></span> By ordre tellen you it all.  
<span id="an_713"></span> Ful fair servise and eke ful swete  
<span id="an_714"></span> These briddis maden as they sete.  
<span id="an_715"></span> Layes of love, ful wel sownyng,

<span id="an_717"></span> Summe high and summe eke lowe songe  
<span id="an_718"></span> Upon the braunches grene spronge.  
<span id="an_719"></span> The swetnesse of her melodye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> Made al myn
herte in reverye.  
<span id="an_721"></span> And whan that I hadde herd, I trowe,  
<span id="an_722"></span> These briddis syngyng on a rowe,  
<span id="an_723"></span> Than myght I not withholde me  
<span id="an_724"></span> That I ne wente inne for to see  
<span id="an_725"></span> Sir Myrthe, for my desiryng

<span id="an_736"></span> And with hym in that lusty place  
<span id="an_737"></span> So fair folk and so fresh had he  
<span id="an_738"></span> That whan I saw, I wondred me  
<span id="an_739"></span> Fro whennes siche folk myght come,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> So faire they
weren, alle and some;  
<span id="an_741"></span> For they were lyk, as to my sighte,  
<span id="an_742"></span> To angels that ben fethered brighte.  
<span id="an_743"></span> This folk, of which I telle you soo,  
<span id="an_744"></span> Upon a karole wenten thoo.  
<span id="an_745"></span> A lady karolede hem that hyghte  
<span id="an_746"></span> Gladnesse, \[the\] blissful and the lighte;  
<span id="an_747"></span> Wel coude she synge and lustyly,

<span id="an_751"></span> Hir vois ful clere was and ful swete.

<span id="an_754"></span> As longeth unto karolyng,  
<span id="an_755"></span> For she was wont in every place  
<span id="an_756"></span> To syngen first, folk to solace.  
<span id="an_757"></span> For syngyng moost she gaf hir to;  
<span id="an_758"></span> No craft had she so leef to do.  
<span id="an_759"></span> Tho myghtist thou karoles sen,

<span id="an_766"></span> Somme songe songes of Loreyne,

<span id="an_768"></span> Full swetter than in this contre.  
<span id="an_769"></span> There was many a tymbestere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> And

<span id="an_773"></span> They caste and hente full ofte  
<span id="an_774"></span> Upon a fynger fair and softe,  
<span id="an_775"></span> That they failide never mo.  
<span id="an_776"></span> Ful fetys damyseles two,  
<span id="an_777"></span> Ryght yonge and full of semelyhede,  
<span id="an_778"></span> In kirtles and noon other wede,  
<span id="an_779"></span> And faire tressed every tresse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_780">780</span></span> Hadde Myrthe

<span id="an_781"></span> Amydde the karole for to daunce;  
<span id="an_782"></span> But herof lieth no remembraunce,  
<span id="an_783"></span> Hou that they daunced queyntely.  
<span id="an_784"></span> That oon wolde come all pryvyly  
<span id="an_785"></span> Agayn that other, and whan they were  
<span id="an_786"></span> Togidre almost, they threwe yfere  
<span id="an_787"></span> Her mouthis so that thorough her play  
<span id="an_788"></span> It semed as they kiste alway  
<span id="an_789"></span> To dauncen well koude they the gise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_790">790</span></span> What shulde I
more to you devyse?  
<span id="an_791"></span> Ne bede I never thennes go,  
<span id="an_792"></span> Whiles that I saw hem daunce so.  
<span id="an_793"></span> Upon the karoll wonder faste  
<span id="an_794"></span> I gan biholde, til atte laste  
<span id="an_795"></span> A lady gan me for to espie,  
<span id="an_796"></span> And she was cleped Curtesie,  
<span id="an_797"></span> The worshipfull, the debonaire

<span id="an_801"></span> "Come and, if it lyke you  
<span id="an_802"></span> To dauncen, dauncith with us now."  
<span id="an_803"></span> And I, withoute tariyng,  
<span id="an_804"></span> Wente into the karolyng.  
<span id="an_805"></span> I was abasshed never a dell,  
<span id="an_806"></span> But it to me liked right well  
<span id="an_807"></span> That Curtesie me cleped so  
<span id="an_808"></span> And bad me on the daunce go.  
<span id="an_809"></span> For if I hadde durst, certeyn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> I wolde have

<span id="an_811"></span> As man that was to daunce right blithe.  
<span id="an_812"></span> Thanne gan I loken ofte sithe

<span id="an_814"></span> The countenaunce and the maneres  
<span id="an_815"></span> Of all the folk that daunced there,  
<span id="an_816"></span> And I shal telle what they were.  
<span id="an_817"></span> Ful fair was Myrthe, ful long and high;  
<span id="an_818"></span> A fairer man I nevere sigh.  
<span id="an_819"></span> As round as appil was his face,

<span id="an_821"></span> Fetys he was and wel beseye,

<span id="an_823"></span> His nose by mesure wrought ful right;  
<span id="an_824"></span> Crisp was his heer, and eek ful bright;  
<span id="an_825"></span> His shuldris of a large brede,  
<span id="an_826"></span> And smalish in the girdilstede.  
<span id="an_827"></span> He semed lyk a portreiture,  
<span id="an_828"></span> So noble he was of his stature,  
<span id="an_829"></span> So fair, so joly, and so fetys,

<span id="an_831"></span> Delyver, smert, and of gret myght;  
<span id="an_832"></span> Ne sawe thou nevere man so lyght.  
<span id="an_833"></span> Of berd unnethe hadde he nothyng,  
<span id="an_834"></span> For it was in the firste spryng.  
<span id="an_835"></span> Ful yong he was, and mery of thought,  
<span id="an_836"></span> And in samet, with briddis wrought,

<span id="an_841"></span> In many a place, lowe and hie.  
<span id="an_842"></span> And shod he was with gret maistrie,  
<span id="an_843"></span> With shoon decoped, and with laas.  
<span id="an_844"></span> By druery and by solas  
<span id="an_845"></span> His leef a rosyn chapelet  
<span id="an_846"></span> Hadde mad, and on his heed it set.  
<span id="an_847"></span> And wite ye who was his leef?  
<span id="an_848"></span> Dame Gladnesse there was hym so leef,  
<span id="an_849"></span> That syngith so wel with glad courage,

<span id="an_855"></span> Bothe were they faire and bright of hewe.  
<span id="an_856"></span> She semed lyk a rose newe  
<span id="an_857"></span> Of colour, and hir flesh so tendre

<span id="an_877"></span> And next hir wente, on hir other side,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> But he can

<span id="an_885"></span> This God of Love of his fasoun  
<span id="an_886"></span> Was lyk no knave ne quystroun;  
<span id="an_887"></span> His beaute gretly was to pryse.  
<span id="an_888"></span> But of his robe to devise  
<span id="an_889"></span> I drede encombred for to be;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_890">890</span></span> For nought
clad in silk was he,  
<span id="an_891"></span> But all in floures and in flourettes,  
<span id="an_893"></span> And with losenges and scochouns,  
<span id="an_894"></span> With briddes, lybardes, and lyouns,

<span id="an_896"></span> His garnement was everydell

<span id="an_899"></span> Floures there were of many gise  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900">900</span></span> Sett by

<span id="an_901"></span> Ther lakkide no flour, to my dom,

<span id="an_905"></span> And many a rose-leef ful long

<span id="an_907"></span> And also on his heed was set  
<span id="an_908"></span> Of roses reed a chapelett,

<span id="an_911"></span> The leeves felden as they flyen.  
<span id="an_912"></span> And he was all with briddes wryen,

<span id="an_914"></span> With chalaundre, and with wodewale,  
<span id="an_915"></span> With fynch, with lark, and with archaungell.  
<span id="an_916"></span> He semede as he were an aungell

<span id="an_923"></span> Turke bowes two had he.  
<span id="an_924"></span> That oon of hem was of a tree

<span id="an_926"></span> Ful crokid was that foule stikke,  
<span id="an_927"></span> And knotty here and there also,  
<span id="an_928"></span> And blak as bery or ony slo.  
<span id="an_929"></span> That other bowe was of a plante

<span id="an_935"></span> With ladyes and with bacheleris,  
<span id="an_936"></span> Ful lyghtsom and glad of cheris.  
<span id="an_937"></span> These bowes two held Swete-Lokyng,  
<span id="an_938"></span> That semede lyk no gadelyng.  
<span id="an_939"></span> And ten brode arowis hild he there,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> Of which fyve

<span id="an_941"></span> But they were shaven wel and dight,

<span id="an_953"></span> That other arowe, that hurteth lesse,

<span id="an_971"></span> Five arowis were of other gise,

<span id="an_1004"></span> Ladde on his hond a lady bright,  
<span id="an_1005"></span> Of high prys and of gret degre.  
<span id="an_1006"></span> This lady called was Beaute,

ywys, she hadde alwey.  
<span id="an_1161"></span> Gret loos hath Largesse and gret pris,

<span id="an_1439"></span> I wol nat longe holde you in fable  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440">1440</span></span> Of al this
garden dilectable.  
<span id="an_1441"></span> I mot my tonge stynten nede,  
<span id="an_1442"></span> For I ne may, withouten drede,  
<span id="an_1443"></span> Naught tellen you the beaute al,  
<span id="an_1444"></span> Ne half the bounte therewithal.  
<span id="an_1445"></span> I went on right hond and on left  
<span id="an_1446"></span> About the place; it was nat left,  
<span id="an_1447"></span> Tyl I had \[in\] al the garden ben,  
<span id="an_1448"></span> In the estres that men myghte sen.  
<span id="an_1449"></span> And thus while I wente in my play,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450">1450</span></span> The God of
Love me folowed ay,  
<span id="an_1451"></span> Right as an hunter can abyde  
<span id="an_1452"></span> The beest, tyl he seeth his tyde  
<span id="an_1453"></span> To sheten at good mes to the der,  
<span id="an_1454"></span> Whan that hym nedeth go no ner.  
<span id="an_1455"></span> And so befyl, I rested me  
<span id="an_1456"></span> Besydes a wel, under a tree,  
<span id="an_1457"></span> Which tree in Fraunce men cal a pyn.  
<span id="an_1458"></span> But sithe the tyme of Kyng Pepyn,  
<span id="an_1459"></span> Ne grew there tree in mannes syghte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1460">1460</span></span> So fayr, ne
so wel woxe in highte  
<span id="an_1461"></span> In al that yard so high was non.  
<span id="an_1462"></span> And springyng in a marble ston  
<span id="an_1463"></span> Had Nature set, the sothe to telle,  
<span id="an_1464"></span> Under that pyn-tree a welle.  
<span id="an_1465"></span> And on the border, al withoute,  
<span id="an_1466"></span> Was written in the ston aboute,  
<span id="an_1467"></span> Letters smal that sayden thus,  
<span id="an_1468"></span> "Here starf the fayre Narcisus."  
<span id="an_1469"></span> Narcisus was a bacheler  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1470">1470</span></span> That Love
had caught in his danger,  
<span id="an_1471"></span> And in his net gan hym so strayne,  
<span id="an_1472"></span> And dyd him so to wepe and playne,  
<span id="an_1473"></span> That nede him must his lyf forgo.  
<span id="an_1474"></span> For a fayr lady that hight Echo  
<span id="an_1475"></span> Him loved over any creature,  
<span id="an_1476"></span> And gan for hym such payne endure  
<span id="an_1477"></span> That on a tyme she him tolde  
<span id="an_1478"></span> That if he her loven nolde,  
<span id="an_1479"></span> That her behoved nedes dye;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1480">1480</span></span> There laye
non other remedye.  
<span id="an_1481"></span> But natheles for his beaute  
<span id="an_1482"></span> So feirs and daungerous was he  
<span id="an_1483"></span> That he nolde graunten hir askyng,  
<span id="an_1484"></span> For wepyng ne for fair praiyng.  
<span id="an_1485"></span> And whanne she herde hym werne \[her\] soo,  
<span id="an_1486"></span> She hadde in herte so gret woo,  
<span id="an_1487"></span> And took it in so gret dispit,  
<span id="an_1488"></span> That she, withoute more respit,  
<span id="an_1489"></span> Was deed anoon. But er she deide,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1490">1490</span></span> Full
pitously to God she preide  
<span id="an_1491"></span> That proude-hertid Narcisus,  
<span id="an_1492"></span> That was in love so daungerous,  
<span id="an_1493"></span> Myght on a day ben hampred so  
<span id="an_1494"></span> For love, and ben so hoot for woo,  
<span id="an_1495"></span> That never he myght to joye atteyne,  
<span id="an_1496"></span> And that he shulde feele in every veyne  
<span id="an_1497"></span> What sorowe trewe lovers maken,  
<span id="an_1498"></span> That ben so vilaynsly forsaken.  
<span id="an_1499"></span> This prayer was but resonable;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500">1500</span></span> Therfore
God held it ferme and stable.  
<span id="an_1501"></span> For Narcisus, shortly to telle,  
<span id="an_1502"></span> By aventure com to that welle  
<span id="an_1503"></span> To reste hym in that shadowing  
<span id="an_1504"></span> A day whanne he com fro huntyng.  
<span id="an_1505"></span> This Narcisus hadde suffred paynes  
<span id="an_1506"></span> For rennyng alday in the playnes,  
<span id="an_1507"></span> And was for thurst in gret distresse  
<span id="an_1508"></span> Of heet and of his werynesse  
<span id="an_1509"></span> That hadde his breth almost bynomen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1510">1510</span></span> Whanne he
was to that welle comen,  
<span id="an_1511"></span> That shadowid was with braunches grene,  
<span id="an_1512"></span> He thoughte of thilke water shene  
<span id="an_1513"></span> To drynke, and fresshe hym wel withalle.  
<span id="an_1514"></span> And doun on knees he gan to falle,  
<span id="an_1515"></span> And forth his heed and necke he straughte  
<span id="an_1516"></span> To drynken of that welle a draughte.  
<span id="an_1517"></span> And in the water anoon was seene  
<span id="an_1518"></span> His nose, his mouth, his yen sheene,  
<span id="an_1519"></span> And he therof was all abasshed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1520">1520</span></span> His owne
shadowe had hym bytrasshed,  
<span id="an_1521"></span> For well wende he the forme see  
<span id="an_1522"></span> Of a child of gret beaute.  
<span id="an_1523"></span> Well kouth. Love hym wreke thoo  
<span id="an_1524"></span> Of daunger and of pride also,  
<span id="an_1525"></span> That Narcisus somtyme hym beer.  
<span id="an_1526"></span> He quytte hym well his guerdoun ther,  
<span id="an_1527"></span> For he musede so in the welle  
<span id="an_1528"></span> That, shortly all the sothe to telle,  
<span id="an_1529"></span> He lovede his owne shadowe soo  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1530">1530</span></span> That atte
laste he starf for woo.  
<span id="an_1531"></span> For whanne he saugh that he his wille  
<span id="an_1532"></span> Myght in no maner wey fulfille,  
<span id="an_1533"></span> And that he was so faste caught  
<span id="an_1534"></span> That he hym kouth. comfort nought,  
<span id="an_1535"></span> He loste his wit right in that place,  
<span id="an_1536"></span> And diede withynne a lytel space.  
<span id="an_1537"></span> And thus his warisoun he took  
<span id="an_1538"></span> For the lady that he forsook.  
<span id="an_1539"></span> Ladyes, I preye ensample takith,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1540">1540</span></span> Ye that
ageyns youre love mistakith,  
<span id="an_1541"></span> For if her deth be yow to wite,  
<span id="an_1542"></span> God kan ful well youre while quyte.  
<span id="an_1543"></span> Whanne that this lettre of which I telle  
<span id="an_1544"></span> Hadde taught me that it was the welle  
<span id="an_1545"></span> Of Narcisus in his beaute,  
<span id="an_1546"></span> I gan anoon withdrawe me,  
<span id="an_1547"></span> Whanne it fel in my remembraunce  
<span id="an_1548"></span> That hym bitidde such myschaunce.  
<span id="an_1549"></span> But at the laste thanne thought I  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1550">1550</span></span> That
scatheles, full sykerly,  
<span id="an_1551"></span> I myght unto the welle goo.  
<span id="an_1552"></span> Wherof shulde I abasshen soo?  
<span id="an_1554"></span> And doun I loutede for to see  
<span id="an_1555"></span> The clere water in the stoon,  
<span id="an_1556"></span> And eke the gravell, which that shoon  
<span id="an_1557"></span> Down in the botme as silver fyn,  
<span id="an_1558"></span> For of the well this is the fyn:  
<span id="an_1559"></span> In world is noon so cler of hewe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1560">1560</span></span> The water
is evere fresh and newe,  
<span id="an_1561"></span> That welmeth up with wawis brighte  
<span id="an_1562"></span> The mountance of two fynger highte.  
<span id="an_1563"></span> Abouten it is gras spryngyng,  
<span id="an_1564"></span> For moiste so thikke and wel likyng  
<span id="an_1565"></span> That it ne may in wynter dye  
<span id="an_1566"></span> No more than may the see be drye.  
<span id="an_1567"></span> Down at the botme set saw I  
<span id="an_1568"></span> Two cristall stonys craftely  
<span id="an_1569"></span> In thilke freshe and faire welle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1570">1570</span></span> But o thing
sothly dar I telle,  
<span id="an_1571"></span> That ye wole holde a gret mervayle  
<span id="an_1572"></span> Whanne it is told, withouten fayle.  
<span id="an_1573"></span> For whanne the sonne, cler in sighte,  
<span id="an_1574"></span> Cast in that well his bemys brighte,  
<span id="an_1575"></span> And that the heete descendid is,  
<span id="an_1576"></span> Thanne taketh the cristall stoon, ywis,  
<span id="an_1577"></span> Agayn the sonne an hundrid hewis,  
<span id="an_1578"></span> Blew, yelow, and red, that fresh and newe
is.  
<span id="an_1579"></span> Yitt hath the merveilous cristall  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> Such
strengthe that the place overall,  
<span id="an_1581"></span> Bothe flour and tree and leves grene  
<span id="an_1582"></span> And all the yerd in it is seene.  
<span id="an_1583"></span> And for to don you to undirstonde,  
<span id="an_1584"></span> To make ensample wole I fonde.  
<span id="an_1585"></span> Ryght as a myrrour openly  
<span id="an_1586"></span> Shewith all thing that stondith therby,  
<span id="an_1587"></span> As well the colour as the figure,  
<span id="an_1588"></span> Withouten ony coverture,  
<span id="an_1589"></span> Right so the cristall stoon shynyng  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1590">1590</span></span> Withouten
ony disseyvyng  
<span id="an_1591"></span> The estrees of the yerd accusith  
<span id="an_1592"></span> To hym that in the water musith.  
<span id="an_1593"></span> For evere, in which half that he be,  
<span id="an_1594"></span> He may well half the gardyn se,  
<span id="an_1595"></span> And if he turne, he may right well  
<span id="an_1596"></span> Sen the remenaunt everydell.  
<span id="an_1597"></span> For ther is noon so litil thyng  
<span id="an_1598"></span> So hid, ne closid with shittyng,  
<span id="an_1599"></span> That it ne is sene, as though it were  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600">1600</span></span> Peyntid in
the cristall there.  
<span id="an_1601"></span> This is the mirrour perilous  
<span id="an_1602"></span> In which the proude Narcisus  
<span id="an_1603"></span> Saw all his face fair and bright,  
<span id="an_1604"></span> That made hym sithe to ligge upright.  
<span id="an_1605"></span> For whoso loketh in that mirrour,  
<span id="an_1606"></span> Ther may nothyng ben his socour  
<span id="an_1607"></span> That he ne shall there sen somthyng  
<span id="an_1608"></span> That shal hym lede into lovyng.  
<span id="an_1609"></span> Full many worthy man hath it  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1610">1610</span></span> Blent, for
folk of grettist wit  
<span id="an_1611"></span> Ben soone caught heere and awayted;  
<span id="an_1612"></span> Withouten respit ben they baited.  
<span id="an_1613"></span> Heere comth to folk of newe rage;  
<span id="an_1614"></span> Heere chaungith many wight corage;  
<span id="an_1615"></span> Heere lith no red ne wit therto;  
<span id="an_1616"></span> For Venus sone, daun Cupido,  
<span id="an_1617"></span> Hath sowen there of love the seed,  
<span id="an_1618"></span> That help ne lith there noon, ne red,  
<span id="an_1619"></span> So cerclith it the welle aboute.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> His gynnes
hath he sette withoute,  
<span id="an_1621"></span> Ryght for to cacche in his panters  
<span id="an_1622"></span> These damoysels and bachelers.  
<span id="an_1623"></span> Love will noon other bridde\[s\] cacche,  
<span id="an_1624"></span> Though he sette either net or lacche.  
<span id="an_1625"></span> And for the seed that heere was sowen,  
<span id="an_1626"></span> This welle is clepid, as well is knowen,  
<span id="an_1627"></span> The Welle of Love, of verray right,  
<span id="an_1628"></span> Of which ther hath ful many a wight  
<span id="an_1629"></span> Spoken in bookis dyversely.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1630">1630</span></span> But they
shull never so verily  
<span id="an_1631"></span> Descripcioun of the welle heere,  
<span id="an_1632"></span> Ne eke the sothe of this matere,  
<span id="an_1633"></span> As ye shull, whanne I have undo  
<span id="an_1634"></span> The craft that hir bilongith too.  
<span id="an_1635"></span> Allway me liked for to dwelle  
<span id="an_1636"></span> To sen the cristall in the welle  
<span id="an_1637"></span> That shewide me full openly  
<span id="an_1638"></span> A thousand thinges faste by.  
<span id="an_1639"></span> But I may say, in sory houre  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1640">1640</span></span> Stode I to
loken or to poure,  
<span id="an_1641"></span> For sithen \[have\] I sore siked.  
<span id="an_1642"></span> That mirrour hath me now entriked,  
<span id="an_1643"></span> But hadde I first knowen in my wit  
<span id="an_1644"></span> The vertu and \[the\] strengthe of it,  
<span id="an_1645"></span> I nolde not have mused there.  
<span id="an_1646"></span> Me hadde bet ben elliswhere,  
<span id="an_1647"></span> For in the snare I fell anoon  
<span id="an_1648"></span> That hath bitrasshed many oon.  
<span id="an_1649"></span> In thilke mirrour saw I tho,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1650">1650</span></span> Among a
thousand thinges mo,  
<span id="an_1651"></span> A roser chargid full of rosis,  
<span id="an_1652"></span> That with an hegge aboute enclos is.  
<span id="an_1653"></span> Tho had I sich lust and envie,  
<span id="an_1654"></span> That for Parys ne for Pavie  
<span id="an_1655"></span> Nolde I have left to goon and see  
<span id="an_1656"></span> There grettist hep of roses be.  
<span id="an_1657"></span> Whanne I was with this rage hent,  
<span id="an_1658"></span> That caught hath many a man and shent,  
<span id="an_1659"></span> Toward the roser gan I go;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1660">1660</span></span> And whanne
I was not fer therfro,  
<span id="an_1661"></span> The savour of the roses swote  
<span id="an_1662"></span> Me smot right to the herte-rote,  
<span id="an_1663"></span> As I hadde all enbawmed be.  
<span id="an_1664"></span> And if I ne hadde endouted me  
<span id="an_1665"></span> To have ben hatid or assailed,  
<span id="an_1666"></span> My thankis, wolde I not have failed  
<span id="an_1667"></span> To pulle a rose of all that route  
<span id="an_1668"></span> To beren in myn hond aboute  
<span id="an_1669"></span> And smellen to it where I wente;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1670">1670</span></span> But ever I
dredde me to repente,  
<span id="an_1671"></span> And lest it grevede or forthoughte  
<span id="an_1672"></span> The lord that thilke gardyn wroughte.  
<span id="an_1673"></span> Of roses ther were gret wone,  
<span id="an_1674"></span> So faire waxe never in rone.  
<span id="an_1675"></span> Of knoppes clos some sawe I there;  
<span id="an_1676"></span> And some wel beter woxen were;  
<span id="an_1677"></span> And some ther ben of other moysoun  
<span id="an_1678"></span> That drowe nygh to her sesoun  
<span id="an_1679"></span> And spedde hem faste for to sprede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1680">1680</span></span> I love well
sich roses rede,  
<span id="an_1681"></span> For brode roses and open also  
<span id="an_1682"></span> Ben passed in a day or two,  
<span id="an_1683"></span> But knoppes wille \[al\] freshe be  
<span id="an_1684"></span> Two dayes, atte leest, or thre.  
<span id="an_1685"></span> The knoppes gretly liked me,  
<span id="an_1686"></span> For fairer may ther no man se.  
<span id="an_1687"></span> Whoso myght have oon of alle,  
<span id="an_1688"></span> It ought hym ben full lief withalle.  
<span id="an_1689"></span> Might I \[a\] gerlond of hem geten,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1690">1690</span></span> For no

<span id="an_1691"></span> Among the knoppes I ches oon  
<span id="an_1692"></span> So fair that of the remenaunt noon  
<span id="an_1693"></span> Ne preise I half so well as it,  
<span id="an_1694"></span> Whanne I avise it in my wit.  
<span id="an_1695"></span> For it so well was enlumyned  
<span id="an_1696"></span> With colour reed, \[and\] as well fyned  
<span id="an_1697"></span> As nature couth. it make faire.  
<span id="an_1698"></span> And it hath leves wel foure paire,  
<span id="an_1699"></span> That Kynde hath sett, thorough his knowyng,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700">1700</span></span> Aboute the

<span id="an_1701"></span> The stalke was as rishe right,  
<span id="an_1702"></span> And theron stod the knoppe upright  
<span id="an_1703"></span> That it ne bowide upon no side.  
<span id="an_1704"></span> The swote smelle sprong so wide  
<span id="an_1705"></span> That it dide all the place aboute
