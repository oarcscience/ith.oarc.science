#### Troilus and Criseyde

### Book 5

<span id="an_1"></span> Aprochen gan the fatal destyne  
<span id="an_2"></span> That Joves hath in disposicioun,  
<span id="an_3"></span> And to yow, angry Parcas, sustren thre,  
<span id="an_4"></span> Committeth to don execucioun;  
<span id="an_5"></span> For which Criseyde moste out of the town,  
<span id="an_6"></span> And Troilus shal dwellen forth in pyne  
<span id="an_7"></span> Til Lachesis his thred no lenger twyne.  
<span id="an_8"></span> The gold-tressed Phebus heighe on-lofte  
<span id="an_9"></span> Thries hadde alle with his bemes cleene  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> The snowes
molte, and Zepherus as ofte  
<span id="an_11"></span> Ibrought ayeyn the tendre leves grene,  
<span id="an_12"></span> Syn that the sone of Ecuba the queene  
<span id="an_13"></span> Bigan to love hire first for whom his sorwe  
<span id="an_14"></span> Was al, that she departe sholde a-morwe.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Ful redy was at prime Diomede  
<span id="an_16"></span> Criseyde unto the Grekis oost to lede,  
<span id="an_17"></span> For sorwe of which she felt hire herte blede,  
<span id="an_18"></span> As she that nyste what was best to rede.  
<span id="an_19"></span> And trewely, as men in bokes rede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> Men wiste
nevere womman han the care,  
<span id="an_21"></span> Ne was so loth out of a town to fare.  
<span id="an_22"></span> This Troilus, withouten reed or loore,  
<span id="an_23"></span> As man that hath his joies ek forlore,  
<span id="an_24"></span> Was waytyng on his lady evere more  
<span id="an_25"></span> As she that was the sothfast crop and more  
<span id="an_26"></span> Of al his lust or joies heretofore.  
<span id="an_27"></span> But Troilus, now far-wel al thi joie,  
<span id="an_28"></span> For shaltow nevere sen hire eft in Troie!  
<span id="an_29"></span> Soth is that while he bood in this manere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> He gan his wo
ful manly for to hide,  
<span id="an_31"></span> That wel unnethe it sene was in his chere;  
<span id="an_32"></span> But at the yate ther she sholde out ride,  
<span id="an_33"></span> With certeyn folk he hoved hire t' abide,  
<span id="an_34"></span> So wo-bigon, al wolde he naught hym pleyne,  
<span id="an_35"></span> That on his hors unnethe he sat for peyne.  
<span id="an_36"></span> For ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe,  
<span id="an_37"></span> Whan Diomede on horse gan hym dresse,  
<span id="an_38"></span> And seyde to hymself this ilke sawe:  
<span id="an_39"></span> "Allas," quod he, "thus foul a wrecchednesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> Whi suffre ich
it? Whi nyl ich it redresse?  
<span id="an_41"></span> Were it nat bet atones for to dye  
<span id="an_42"></span> Than evere more in langour thus to drye?  
<span id="an_43"></span> "Whi nyl I make atones riche and pore  
<span id="an_44"></span> To have inough to doone er that she go?  
<span id="an_45"></span> Why nyl I brynge al Troie upon a roore?  
<span id="an_46"></span> Whi nyl I slen this Diomede also?  
<span id="an_47"></span> Why nyl I rather with a man or two  
<span id="an_48"></span> Stele hire away? Whi wol I this endure?  
<span id="an_49"></span> Whi nyl I helpen to myn owen cure?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> But why he
nolde don so fel a dede,  
<span id="an_51"></span> That shal I seyn, and whi hym liste it spare:  
<span id="an_52"></span> He hadde in herte alweyes a manere drede  
<span id="an_53"></span> Lest that Criseyde, in rumour of this fare,  
<span id="an_54"></span> Sholde han ben slayn; lo, this was al his
care.  
<span id="an_55"></span> And ellis, certeyn, as I seyde yore,  
<span id="an_56"></span> He hadde it don, withouten wordes more.  
<span id="an_57"></span> Criseyde, whan she redy was to ride,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Ful sorwfully she sighte, and seyde "Allas!"  
<span id="an_59"></span> But forth she moot, for aught that may
bitide;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Ther is non
other remedie in this cas.  
<span id="an_61"></span> And forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas.  
<span id="an_62"></span> What wonder is, though that hire sore smerte,  
<span id="an_63"></span> Whan she forgoth hire owen swete herte?  
<span id="an_64"></span> This Troilus, in wise of curteysie,  
<span id="an_65"></span> With hauk on honde and with an huge route  
<span id="an_66"></span> Of knyghtes, rood and did hire companye,  
<span id="an_67"></span> Passyng al the valeye fer withoute,  
<span id="an_68"></span> And ferther wolde han riden, out of doute,  
<span id="an_69"></span> Ful fayn, and wo was hym to gon so sone;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> But torne he
moste, and it was ek to done.  
<span id="an_71"></span> And right with that was Antenor ycome  
<span id="an_72"></span> Out of the Grekis oost, and every wight  
<span id="an_73"></span> Was of it glad, and seyde he was welcome.  
<span id="an_74"></span> And Troilus, al nere his herte light,  
<span id="an_75"></span> He peyned hym with al his fulle myght  
<span id="an_76"></span> Hym to withholde of wepyng atte leeste,  
<span id="an_77"></span> And Antenor he kiste and made feste.  
<span id="an_78"></span> And therwithal he moste his leve take,  
<span id="an_79"></span> And caste his eye upon hire pitously,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> And neer he
rood, his cause for to make,  
<span id="an_81"></span> To take hire by the honde al sobrely.  
<span id="an_82"></span> And Lord, so she gan wepen tendrely!  
<span id="an_83"></span> And he ful softe and sleighly gan hire seye,  
<span id="an_84"></span> "Now holde youre day, and do me nat to deye."  
<span id="an_85"></span> With that his courser torned he aboute  
<span id="an_86"></span> With face pale, and unto Diomede  
<span id="an_87"></span> No word he spak, ne non of al his route;  
<span id="an_88"></span> Of which the sone of Tideus took hede,  
<span id="an_89"></span> As he that koude more than the crede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> In swich a
craft, and by the reyne hire hente;  
<span id="an_91"></span> And Troilus to Troie homward he wente.  
<span id="an_92"></span> This Diomede, that ledde hire by the bridel,  
<span id="an_93"></span> Whan that he saugh the folk of Troie aweye,  
<span id="an_94"></span> Thoughte, "Al my labour shal nat ben on ydel,  
<span id="an_95"></span> If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye,  
<span id="an_96"></span> For at the werste it may yet shorte oure
weye.  
<span id="an_97"></span> I have herd seyd ek tymes twyes twelve,  
<span id="an_98"></span> \`He is a fool that wol foryete hymselve.'"  
<span id="an_99"></span> But natheles, this thoughte he wel ynough,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> That
"Certeynlich I am aboute nought,  
<span id="an_101"></span> If that I speke of love or make it tough;  
<span id="an_102"></span> For douteles, if she have in hire thought  
<span id="an_103"></span> Hym that I gesse, he may nat ben ybrought  
<span id="an_104"></span> So soon awey; but I shal fynde a meene  
<span id="an_105"></span> That she naught wite as yet shal what I
mene."  
<span id="an_106"></span> This Diomede, as he that koude his good,  
<span id="an_107"></span> Whan tyme was, gan fallen forth in speche  
<span id="an_108"></span> Of this and that, and axed whi she stood  
<span id="an_109"></span> In swich disese, and gan hire ek biseche  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> That if that
he encresse myghte or eche  
<span id="an_111"></span> With any thyng hire ese, that she sholde  
<span id="an_112"></span> Comaunde it hym, and seyde he don it wolde.  
<span id="an_113"></span> For treweliche he swor hire as a knyght  
<span id="an_114"></span> That ther nas thyng with which he myghte hire
plese,  
<span id="an_115"></span> That he nolde don his peyne and al his myght  
<span id="an_116"></span> To don it, for to don hire herte an ese;  
<span id="an_117"></span> And preyede hire she wolde hire sorwe apese,  
<span id="an_118"></span> And seyde, "Iwis, we Grekis kan have joie  
<span id="an_119"></span> To honouren yow as wel as folk of Troie."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> He seyde ek
thus: "I woot yow thynketh straunge --  
<span id="an_121"></span> Ne wonder is, for it is to yow newe --  
<span id="an_122"></span> Th' aquayntaunce of thise Troianis to
chaunge  
<span id="an_123"></span> For folk of Grece, that ye nevere knewe.  
<span id="an_124"></span> But wolde nevere God but if as trewe  
<span id="an_125"></span> A Grek ye sholde among us alle fynde  
<span id="an_126"></span> As any Troian is, and ek as kynde.  
<span id="an_127"></span> "And by the cause I swor yow right, lo, now,  
<span id="an_128"></span> To ben youre frend, and helply, to my myght,  
<span id="an_129"></span> And for that more aquayntaunce ek of yow  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Have ich had
than another straunger wight,  
<span id="an_131"></span> So fro this forth, I pray yow, day and nyght  
<span id="an_132"></span> Comaundeth me, how soore that me smerte,  
<span id="an_133"></span> To don al that may like unto youre herte;  
<span id="an_134"></span> "And that ye me wolde as youre brother

<span id="an_135"></span> And taketh naught my frendshipe in despit;  
<span id="an_136"></span> And though youre sorwes be for thynges grete
--  
<span id="an_137"></span> Not I nat whi -- but out of more respit  
<span id="an_138"></span> Myn herte hath for t' amende it gret delit;  
<span id="an_139"></span> And if I may youre harmes nat redresse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> I am right
sory for youre hevynesse,  
<span id="an_141"></span> "For though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe  
<span id="an_142"></span> Han many a day ben, alwey yet, parde,  
<span id="an_143"></span> O god of Love in soth we serven bothe.  
<span id="an_144"></span> And for the love of God, my lady fre,

<span id="an_148"></span> "And nere it that we ben so neigh the tente

<span id="an_155"></span> "Thus seyde I nevere er now to womman born,

<span id="an_162"></span> "And wondreth nought, myn owen lady bright,  
<span id="an_163"></span> Though that I speke of love to yow thus

<span id="an_166"></span> Ek I am nat of power for to stryve  
<span id="an_167"></span> Ayeyns the god of Love, but hym obeye  
<span id="an_168"></span> I wole alwey; and mercy I yow preye.  
<span id="an_169"></span> "Ther ben so worthi knyghtes in this place,

<span id="an_175"></span> Nil non of hem as I shal til I sterve."  
<span id="an_176"></span> Criseyde unto that purpos lite answerde,  
<span id="an_177"></span> As she that was with sorwe oppressed so  
<span id="an_178"></span> That, in effect, she naught his tales herde  
<span id="an_179"></span> But here and ther, now here a word or two.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> Hire thoughte
hire sorwful herte brast a-two,  
<span id="an_181"></span> For whan she gan hire fader fer espie  
<span id="an_182"></span> Wel neigh down of hire hors she gan to sye.  
<span id="an_183"></span> But natheles she thonketh Diomede  
<span id="an_184"></span> Of al his travaile and his goode cheere,  
<span id="an_185"></span> And that hym list his frendshipe hire to
bede;  
<span id="an_186"></span> And she accepteth it in good manere,  
<span id="an_187"></span> And wol do fayn that is hym lief and dere,  
<span id="an_188"></span> And tristen hym she wolde, and wel she
myghte,  
<span id="an_189"></span> As seyde she; and from hire hors sh'
alighte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> Hire fader
hath hire in his armes nome,  
<span id="an_191"></span> And twenty tyme he kiste his doughter
sweete,  
<span id="an_192"></span> And seyde, "O deere doughter myn, welcome!"  
<span id="an_193"></span> She seyde ek she was fayn with hym to mete,  
<span id="an_194"></span> And stood forth muwet, milde, and mansuete.  
<span id="an_195"></span> But here I leve hire with hire fader dwelle,  
<span id="an_196"></span> And forth I wol of Troilus yow telle.  
<span id="an_197"></span> To Troie is come this woful Troilus,  
<span id="an_198"></span> In sorwe aboven alle sorwes smerte,  
<span id="an_199"></span> With feloun look and face dispitous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Tho sodeynly
doun from his hors he sterte,  
<span id="an_201"></span> And thorugh his paleis, with a swollen
herte,  
<span id="an_202"></span> To chaumbre he wente; of nothyng took he
hede,  
<span id="an_203"></span> Ne non to hym dar speke a word for drede.  
<span id="an_204"></span> And ther his sorwes that he spared hadde  
<span id="an_205"></span> He yaf an issue large, and "Deth!" he
criede;  
<span id="an_206"></span> And in his throwes frenetik and madde  
<span id="an_207"></span> He corseth Jove, Appollo, and ek Cupide;  
<span id="an_208"></span> He corseth Ceres, Bacus, and Cipride,  
<span id="an_209"></span> His burthe, hymself, his fate, and ek
nature,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> And, save his
lady, every creature.  
<span id="an_211"></span> To bedde he goth, and walwith ther and
torneth  
<span id="an_212"></span> In furie, as doth he Ixion in helle,  
<span id="an_213"></span> And in this wise he neigh til day sojorneth.  
<span id="an_214"></span> But tho bigan his herte a lite unswelle  
<span id="an_215"></span> Thorugh teris, which that gonnen up to
welle,  
<span id="an_216"></span> And pitously he cryde upon Criseyde,  
<span id="an_217"></span> And to hymself right thus he spak, and
seyde,  
<span id="an_218"></span> "Wher is myn owene lady, lief and deere?  
<span id="an_219"></span> Wher is hire white brest? Wher is it, where?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> Wher ben hire

<span id="an_222"></span> Now may I wepe allone many a teere,  
<span id="an_223"></span> And graspe aboute I may, but in this place,  
<span id="an_224"></span> Save a pilowe, I fynde naught t' enbrace.  
<span id="an_225"></span> "How shal I do? Whan shal she come ayeyn?  
<span id="an_226"></span> I not, allas, whi lete ich hire to go;

<span id="an_231"></span> Se how I dey, ye nyl me nat rescowe!  
<span id="an_232"></span> "Who seth yow now, my righte lode-sterre?  
<span id="an_233"></span> Who sit right now or stant in youre

<span id="an_235"></span> Now I am gon, whom yeve ye audience?  
<span id="an_236"></span> Who speketh for me right now in myn absence?  
<span id="an_237"></span> Allas, no wight; and that is al my care,  
<span id="an_238"></span> For wel woot I, as yvele as I ye fare.  
<span id="an_239"></span> "How sholde I thus ten dayes ful endure,

<span id="an_244"></span> Shal ben youre fresshe, wommanliche face  
<span id="an_245"></span> For langour, er ye torne unto this place."  
<span id="an_246"></span> And whan he fil in any slomberynges,  
<span id="an_247"></span> Anon bygynne he sholde for to grone  
<span id="an_248"></span> And dremen of the dredefulleste thynges

<span id="an_256"></span> That of the fere his body sholde quake;  
<span id="an_257"></span> And therwithal he sholde a noyse make,  
<span id="an_258"></span> And seme as though he sholde falle depe  
<span id="an_259"></span> From heighe o-lofte; and thanne he wolde

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> And rewen on
hymself so pitously  
<span id="an_261"></span> That wonder was to here his fantasie.  
<span id="an_262"></span> Another tyme he sholde myghtyly

<span id="an_475"></span> That passed was; and thus he drof t' an ende  
<span id="an_476"></span> The ferthe day, and seyde he wolde wende.  
<span id="an_477"></span> And seyde, "Leve brother Pandarus,

<span id="an_484"></span> Pandare answerde, "Be we comen hider

<span id="an_498"></span> Thus Pandarus, with alle peyne and wo,  
<span id="an_499"></span> Made hym to dwelle; and at the wikes ende  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> Of Sarpedoun

<span id="an_508"></span> Er Calkas sende Troilus Criseyde!"  
<span id="an_509"></span> But natheles, he japed thus, and pleyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> And swor,
ywys, his herte hym wel bihighte  
<span id="an_511"></span> She wolde come as soone as evere she myghte.  
<span id="an_512"></span> Whan they unto the paleys were ycomen

<span id="an_517"></span> And after this, whan that hem bothe leste,  
<span id="an_518"></span> They spedde hem fro the soper unto reste.  
<span id="an_519"></span> On morwe, as soone as day bygan to clere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> This Troilus

<span id="an_529"></span> But Lord, this sely Troilus was wo!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> Hym thoughte

<span id="an_533"></span> Therwith, whan he was war and gan biholde  
<span id="an_534"></span> How shet was every wyndow of the place,  
<span id="an_535"></span> As frost, hym thoughte, his herte gan to

<span id="an_536"></span> For which with chaunged dedlich pale face,  
<span id="an_537"></span> Withouten word, he forthby gan to pace,  
<span id="an_538"></span> And as God wolde, he gan so faste ride  
<span id="an_539"></span> That no wight of his contenance espide.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> Than seide he

<span id="an_554"></span> Therwith he caste on Pandarus his ye,  
<span id="an_555"></span> With chaunged face, and pitous to biholde;  
<span id="an_556"></span> And whan he myghte his tyme aright aspie,

<span id="an_561"></span> Fro thennesforth he rideth up and down,  
<span id="an_562"></span> And every thyng com hym to remembraunce  
<span id="an_563"></span> As he rood forby places of the town

<span id="an_582"></span> Thanne thoughte he thus: "O blisful lord
Cupide,  
<span id="an_583"></span> Whan I the proces have in my memorie  
<span id="an_584"></span> How thow me hast wereyed on every syde,  
<span id="an_585"></span> Men myght a book make of it, lik a storie.  
<span id="an_586"></span> What nede is the to seke on me victorie,

<span id="an_603"></span> And after this he to the yates wente  
<span id="an_604"></span> Ther as Criseyde out rood a ful good paas,  
<span id="an_605"></span> And up and down ther made he many a wente,  
<span id="an_606"></span> And to hymself ful ofte he seyde, "Allas,

<span id="an_617"></span> And of hymself ymagened he ofte  
<span id="an_618"></span> To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse  
<span id="an_619"></span> Than he was wont, and that men seyden softe,

be? Who kan the sothe gesse

<span id="an_622"></span> And al this nas but his malencolie,  
<span id="an_623"></span> That he hadde of hymself swich fantasie.  
<span id="an_624"></span> Another tyme ymaginen he wolde  
<span id="an_625"></span> That every wight that wente by the weye  
<span id="an_626"></span> Hadde of hym routhe, and that they seyen
sholde,  
<span id="an_627"></span> "I am right sory Troilus wol deye."  
<span id="an_628"></span> And thus he drof a day yet forth or tweye,  
<span id="an_629"></span> As ye have herd; swich lif right gan he lede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> As he that

<span id="an_631"></span> For which hym likede in his songes shewe  
<span id="an_632"></span> Th' enchesoun of his wo, as he best myghte;  
<span id="an_633"></span> And made a song of wordes but a fewe,  
<span id="an_634"></span> Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte;  
<span id="an_635"></span> And whan he was from every mannes syghte,  
<span id="an_636"></span> With softe vois he of his lady deere,  
<span id="an_637"></span> That absent was, gan synge as ye may heere:  
<span id="an_638"></span> "O sterre, of which I lost have al the

<span id="an_639"></span> With herte soor wel oughte I to biwaille  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> That evere

<span id="an_645"></span> This song whan he thus songen hadde, soone  
<span id="an_646"></span> He fil ayeyn into his sikes olde;  
<span id="an_647"></span> And every nyght, as was his wone to doone,  
<span id="an_648"></span> He stood the brighte moone to byholde,  
<span id="an_649"></span> And al his sorwe he to the moone tolde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> And seyde,
"Ywis, whan thow art horned newe,

<span id="an_659"></span> The dayes moore and lenger every nyght

wont to be, hym thoughte tho,  
<span id="an_661"></span> And that the sonne went his cours unright  
<span id="an_662"></span> By lenger weye than it was wont to do;  
<span id="an_663"></span> And seyde, "Ywis, me dredeth evere mo

<span id="an_666"></span> Upon the walles faste ek wolde he walke,  
<span id="an_667"></span> And on the Grekis oost he wolde se;  
<span id="an_668"></span> And to hymself right thus he wolde talke:  
<span id="an_669"></span> "Lo, yonder is myn owene lady free,

<span id="an_676"></span> I preve it thus: for in noon other place

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> This longe
tyme he dryveth forth right thus  
<span id="an_681"></span> Til fully passed was the nynthe nyght;  
<span id="an_682"></span> And ay bisyde hym was this Pandarus,  
<span id="an_683"></span> That bisily did al his fulle myght

<span id="an_685"></span> Yevyng hym hope alwey the tenthe morwe  
<span id="an_686"></span> That she shal come and stynten al his sorwe.  
<span id="an_687"></span> Upon that other syde ek was Criseyde,  
<span id="an_688"></span> With wommen fewe, among the Grekis stronge,  
<span id="an_689"></span> For which ful ofte a day "Allas," she seyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> "That I was
born! Wel may myn herte longe  
<span id="an_691"></span> After my deth, for now lyve I to longe.  
<span id="an_692"></span> Allas, and I ne may it nat amende,

<span id="an_707"></span> Now, myghty God, thow on my sorwe rewe!"  
<span id="an_708"></span> Ful pale ywoxen was hire brighte face,  
<span id="an_709"></span> Hire lymes lene, as she that al the day  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> Stood, whan

<span id="an_711"></span> Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde
ay;  
<span id="an_712"></span> And al the nyght wepyng, allas, she lay.  
<span id="an_713"></span> And thus despeired, out of alle cure,  
<span id="an_714"></span> She ladde hire lif, this woful creature.  
<span id="an_715"></span> Ful ofte a day she sighte ek for destresse,  
<span id="an_716"></span> And in hireself she wente ay purtraynge

<span id="an_721"></span> Thorugh remembraunce of that she gan desire.  
<span id="an_722"></span> In al this world ther nys so cruel herte

<span id="an_726"></span> Hire nedede no teris for to borwe!  
<span id="an_727"></span> And this was yet the werste of al hire

<span id="an_728"></span> Ther was no wight to whom she dorste hire

<span id="an_729"></span> Ful rewfully she loked upon Troie,

<span id="an_766"></span> But God it wot, er fully monthes two,  
<span id="an_767"></span> She was ful fer fro that entencioun!

<span id="an_795"></span> And right anon, as he that bold was ay,  
<span id="an_796"></span> Thoughte in his herte, "Happe how happe may,  
<span id="an_797"></span> Al sholde I dye, I wol hire herte seche!  
<span id="an_798"></span> I shal namore lesen but my speche."  
<span id="an_799"></span> This Diomede, as bokes us declare,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800">800</span></span> Was in his
nedes prest and corageous,  
<span id="an_801"></span> With sterne vois and myghty lymes square,  
<span id="an_802"></span> Hardy, testif, strong, and chivalrous  
<span id="an_803"></span> Of dedes, lik his fader Tideus.  
<span id="an_804"></span> And som men seyn he was of tonge large;  
<span id="an_805"></span> And heir he was of Calydoigne and Arge.  
<span id="an_806"></span> Criseyde mene was of hire stature;  
<span id="an_807"></span> Therto of shap, of face, and ek of cheere,  
<span id="an_808"></span> Ther myghte ben no fairer creature.  
<span id="an_809"></span> And ofte tymes this was hire manere:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> To gon
ytressed with hire heres clere  
<span id="an_811"></span> Doun by hire coler at hire bak byhynde,  
<span id="an_812"></span> Which with a thred of gold she wolde bynde;  
<span id="an_813"></span> And, save hire browes joyneden yfeere,  
<span id="an_814"></span> Ther nas no lak, in aught I kan espien.  
<span id="an_815"></span> But for to speken of hire eyen cleere,  
<span id="an_816"></span> Lo, trewely, they writen that hire syen  
<span id="an_817"></span> That Paradis stood formed in hire yen.  
<span id="an_818"></span> And with hire riche beaute evere more  
<span id="an_819"></span> Strof love in hire ay, which of hem was
more.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820">820</span></span> She sobre
was, ek symple, and wys withal,  
<span id="an_821"></span> The best ynorisshed ek that myghte be,  
<span id="an_822"></span> And goodly of hire speche in general,  
<span id="an_823"></span> Charitable, estatlich, lusty, fre;  
<span id="an_824"></span> Ne nevere mo ne lakked hire pite;  
<span id="an_825"></span> Tendre-herted, slydynge of corage;  
<span id="an_826"></span> But trewely, I kan nat telle hire age.  
<span id="an_827"></span> And Troilus wel woxen was in highte,  
<span id="an_828"></span> And complet formed by proporcioun  
<span id="an_829"></span> So wel that kynde it nought amenden myghte;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_830">830</span></span> Yong, fressh,
strong, and hardy as lyoun;  
<span id="an_831"></span> Trewe as stiel in ech condicioun;  
<span id="an_832"></span> Oon of the beste entecched creature  
<span id="an_833"></span> That is or shal whil that the world may
dure.  
<span id="an_834"></span> And certeynly in storye it is yfounde  
<span id="an_835"></span> That Troilus was nevere unto no wight,  
<span id="an_836"></span> As in his tyme, in no degree secounde  
<span id="an_837"></span> In durryng don that longeth to a knyght.  
<span id="an_838"></span> Al myghte a geant passen hym of myght,  
<span id="an_839"></span> His herte ay with the first and with the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_840">840</span></span> Stood
paregal, to durre don that hym leste.  
<span id="an_841"></span> But for to tellen forth of Diomede:  
<span id="an_842"></span> It fel that after, on the tenthe day  
<span id="an_843"></span> Syn that Criseyde out of the citee yede,  
<span id="an_844"></span> This Diomede, as fressh as braunche in May,  
<span id="an_845"></span> Com to the tente ther as Calkas lay,  
<span id="an_846"></span> And feyned hym with Calkas han to doone;  
<span id="an_847"></span> But what he mente, I shal yow tellen soone.  
<span id="an_848"></span> Criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle,  
<span id="an_849"></span> Welcomed hym and down hym by hire sette --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_850">850</span></span> And he was
ethe ynough to maken dwelle!  
<span id="an_851"></span> And after this, withouten longe lette,  
<span id="an_852"></span> The spices and the wyn men forth hem fette;  
<span id="an_853"></span> And forth they speke of this and that
yfeere,  
<span id="an_854"></span> As frendes don, of which som shal ye heere.  
<span id="an_855"></span> He gan first fallen of the werre in speche  
<span id="an_856"></span> Bitwixe hem and the folk of Troie town;  
<span id="an_857"></span> And of th' assege he gan hire ek biseche  
<span id="an_858"></span> To telle hym what was hire opynyoun;  
<span id="an_859"></span> Fro that demaunde he so descendeth down  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860">860</span></span> To axen hire
if that hire straunge thoughte  
<span id="an_861"></span> The Grekis gise and werkes that they
wroughte;  
<span id="an_862"></span> And whi hire fader tarieth so longe  
<span id="an_863"></span> To wedden hire unto som worthy wight.  
<span id="an_864"></span> Criseyde, that was in hire peynes stronge  
<span id="an_865"></span> For love of Troilus, hire owen knyght,  
<span id="an_866"></span> As ferforth as she konnyng hadde or myght  
<span id="an_867"></span> Answerde hym tho; but as of his entente,  
<span id="an_868"></span> It semed nat she wiste what he mente.  
<span id="an_869"></span> But natheles, this ilke Diomede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870">870</span></span> Gan in
hymself assure, and thus he seyde:  
<span id="an_871"></span> "If ich aright have taken of yow hede,  
<span id="an_872"></span> Me thynketh thus, O lady myn, Criseyde,  
<span id="an_873"></span> That syn I first hond on youre bridel leyde,  
<span id="an_874"></span> Whan ye out come of Troie by the morwe,

<span id="an_876"></span> "Kan I nat seyn what may the cause be,  
<span id="an_877"></span> But if for love of som Troian it were,  
<span id="an_878"></span> The which right sore wolde athynken me  
<span id="an_879"></span> That ye for any wight that dwelleth there  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> Sholden
spille a quarter of a tere  
<span id="an_881"></span> Or pitously youreselven so bigile --  
<span id="an_882"></span> For dredeles, it is nought worth the while.  
<span id="an_883"></span> "The folk of Troie, as who seyth, alle and

<span id="an_884"></span> In prisoun ben, as ye youreselven se;  
<span id="an_885"></span> Nor thennes shal nat oon on-lyve come

<span id="an_908"></span> He knew ful wel ther shal nat scapen oon

<span id="an_916"></span> For Troie is brought in swich a jupartie  
<span id="an_917"></span> That it to save is now no remedie.  
<span id="an_918"></span> "And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekis fynde

<span id="an_928"></span> And stynte a while; and afterward he wok,  
<span id="an_929"></span> And sobreliche on hire he threw his lok,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> And seyde, "I

<span id="an_931"></span> As gentil man as any wight in Troie.  
<span id="an_932"></span> "For if my fader Tideus," he seyde,

<span id="an_936"></span> But he was slayn -- allas, the more harm is.
--  
<span id="an_937"></span> Unhappily at Thebes al to rathe,

<span id="an_946"></span> What sholde I telle his wordes that he
seyde?  
<span id="an_947"></span> He spak inough for o day at the meeste.  
<span id="an_948"></span> It preveth wel; he spak so that Criseyde  
<span id="an_949"></span> Graunted on the morwe, at his requeste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> For to speken
with hym at the leeste --  
<span id="an_951"></span> So that he nolde speke of swich matere.  
<span id="an_952"></span> And thus to hym she seyde, as ye may here,  
<span id="an_953"></span> As she that hadde hire herte on Troilus  
<span id="an_954"></span> So faste that ther may it non arace;  
<span id="an_955"></span> And strangely she spak, and seyde thus:  
<span id="an_956"></span> "O Diomede, I love that ilke place  
<span id="an_957"></span> Ther I was born; and Joves, for his grace,  
<span id="an_958"></span> Delyvere it soone of al that doth it care!

<span id="an_967"></span> "That Grekis ben of heigh condicioun

<span id="an_974"></span> "But as to speke of love, ywis," she seyde,  
<span id="an_975"></span> "I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was,

<span id="an_1005"></span> And therwithal she caste hire eyen down,

<span id="an_1009"></span> But in effect, and shortly for to seye,

<span id="an_1013"></span> Hire glove he took, of which he was ful
feyn;  
<span id="an_1014"></span> And finaly, whan it was woxen eve

<span id="an_1031"></span> This Diomede is come unto Criseyde;  
<span id="an_1032"></span> And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke,  
<span id="an_1033"></span> So wel he for hymselven spak and seyde

<span id="an_1184"></span> But natheles, he gladed hym in this:  
<span id="an_1185"></span> He thought he misacounted hadde his day,  
<span id="an_1186"></span> And seyde, "I understonde have al amys.  
<span id="an_1187"></span> For thilke nyght I last Criseyde say,

<span id="an_1191"></span> "For which she may yet holde al hire

<span id="an_1192"></span> And on the morwe unto the yate he wente,  
<span id="an_1193"></span> And up and down, by west and ek by este,  
<span id="an_1194"></span> Upon the walles made he many a wente.  
<span id="an_1195"></span> But al for nought; his hope alwey hym
blente.  
<span id="an_1196"></span> For which at nyght, in sorwe and sikes
sore,  
<span id="an_1197"></span> He wente hym hom, withouten any more.  
<span id="an_1198"></span> His hope al clene out of his herte fledde;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> But for the

<span id="an_1201"></span> So were his throwes sharpe and wonder
stronge;  
<span id="an_1202"></span> For whan he saugh that she abood so longe,  
<span id="an_1203"></span> He nyste what he juggen of it myghte,  
<span id="an_1204"></span> Syn she hath broken that she hym bihighte.  
<span id="an_1205"></span> The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sexte day  
<span id="an_1206"></span> After tho dayes ten of which I tolde,

<span id="an_1209"></span> But whan he saugh she nolde hire terme

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> He kan now
sen non other remedie  
<span id="an_1211"></span> But for to shape hym soone for to dye.  
<span id="an_1212"></span> Therwith the wikked spirit, God us blesse,  
<span id="an_1213"></span> Which that men clepeth woode jalousie,  
<span id="an_1214"></span> Gan in hym crepe, in al this hevynesse;  
<span id="an_1215"></span> For which, by cause he wolde soone dye,  
<span id="an_1216"></span> He ne et ne drank, for his malencolye,  
<span id="an_1217"></span> And ek from every compaignye he fledde:  
<span id="an_1218"></span> This was the lif that al the tyme he ledde.  
<span id="an_1219"></span> He so defet was, that no manere man  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1220">1220</span></span> Unneth hym
myghte knowen ther he wente;  
<span id="an_1221"></span> So was he lene, and therto pale and wan,  
<span id="an_1222"></span> And feble, that he walketh by potente;  
<span id="an_1223"></span> And with his ire he thus hymselve shente.  
<span id="an_1224"></span> But whoso axed hym wherof hym smerte,  
<span id="an_1225"></span> He seyde his harm was al aboute his herte.  
<span id="an_1226"></span> Priam ful ofte, and ek his moder deere,  
<span id="an_1227"></span> His bretheren and his sustren gonne hym
freyne  
<span id="an_1228"></span> Whi he so sorwful was in al his cheere,  
<span id="an_1229"></span> And what thyng was the cause of al his
peyne;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1230">1230</span></span> But al for
naught. He nolde his cause pleyne,  
<span id="an_1231"></span> But seyde he felte a grevous maladie  
<span id="an_1232"></span> Aboute his herte, and fayn he wolde dye.  
<span id="an_1233"></span> So on a day he leyde hym doun to slepe,  
<span id="an_1234"></span> And so byfel that yn his slep hym thoughte  
<span id="an_1235"></span> That in a forest faste he welk to wepe  
<span id="an_1236"></span> For love of here that hym these peynes
wroughte;  
<span id="an_1237"></span> And up and doun as he the forest soughte,  
<span id="an_1238"></span> He mette he saugh a bor with tuskes grete,  
<span id="an_1239"></span> That slepte ayeyn the bryghte sonnes hete.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1240">1240</span></span> And by this
bor, faste in his armes folde,  
<span id="an_1241"></span> Lay, kyssyng ay, his lady bryght, Criseyde.  
<span id="an_1242"></span> For sorwe of which, whan he it gan byholde,  
<span id="an_1243"></span> And for despit, out of his slep he breyde,  
<span id="an_1244"></span> And loude he cride on Pandarus, and seyde:  
<span id="an_1245"></span> "O Pandarus, now know I crop and roote.  
<span id="an_1246"></span> I n' am but ded; ther nys noon other bote.  
<span id="an_1247"></span> "My lady bryght, Criseyde, hath me

<span id="an_1253"></span> And al this thing to Pandarus he tolde.

<span id="an_1575"></span> That Calkas caused al hire tariynge.  
<span id="an_1576"></span> And ofte tyme he was in purpos grete

<span id="an_1648"></span> Of hire for whom he wende for to dye.  
<span id="an_1649"></span> And so bifel that thorughout Troye town,
