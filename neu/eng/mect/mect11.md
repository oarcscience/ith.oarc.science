#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Wife of Bath's Prologue

<span id="an_1"></span> "Experience, though noon auctoritee  
<span id="an_2"></span> Were in this world, is right ynogh for me  
<span id="an_3"></span> To speke of wo that is in mariage;  
<span id="an_4"></span> For, lordynges, sith I twelve yeer was of age,  
<span id="an_5"></span> Thonked be God that is eterne on lyve,  
<span id="an_6"></span> Housbondes at chirche dore I have had fyve --  
<span id="an_7"></span> If I so ofte myghte have ywedded bee --  
<span id="an_8"></span> And alle were worthy men in hir degree.  
<span id="an_9"></span> But me was toold, certeyn, nat longe agoon is,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> That sith that
Crist ne wente nevere but onis  
<span id="an_11"></span> To weddyng, in the Cane of Galilee,  
<span id="an_12"></span> That by the same ensample taughte he me  
<span id="an_13"></span> That I ne sholde wedded be but ones.  
<span id="an_14"></span> Herkne eek, lo, which a sharp word for the
nones,  
<span id="an_15"></span> Biside a welle, Jhesus, God and man,  
<span id="an_16"></span> Spak in repreeve of the Samaritan:  
<span id="an_17"></span> \`Thou hast yhad fyve housbondes,' quod he,  
<span id="an_18"></span> \`And that ilke man that now hath thee  
<span id="an_19"></span> Is noght thyn housbonde,' thus seyde he
certeyn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> What that he
mente therby, I kan nat seyn;  
<span id="an_21"></span> But that I axe, why that the fifthe man  
<span id="an_22"></span> Was noon housbonde to the Samaritan?  
<span id="an_23"></span> How manye myghte she have in mariage?  
<span id="an_24"></span> Yet herde I nevere tellen in myn age  
<span id="an_25"></span> Upon this nombre diffinicioun.  
<span id="an_26"></span> Men may devyne and glosen, up and doun,  
<span id="an_27"></span> But wel I woot, expres, withoute lye,  
<span id="an_28"></span> God bad us for to wexe and multiplye;  
<span id="an_29"></span> That gentil text kan I wel understonde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Eek wel I woot,
he seyde myn housbonde  
<span id="an_31"></span> Sholde lete fader and mooder and take to me.  
<span id="an_32"></span> But of no nombre mencion made he,  
<span id="an_33"></span> Of bigamye, or of octogamye;  
<span id="an_34"></span> Why sholde men thanne speke of it vileynye?  
<span id="an_35"></span> Lo, heere the wise kyng, daun Salomon;  
<span id="an_36"></span> I trowe he hadde wyves mo than oon.  
<span id="an_37"></span> As wolde God it leveful were unto me  
<span id="an_38"></span> To be refresshed half so ofte as he!  
<span id="an_39"></span> Which yifte of God hadde he for alle his
wyvys!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> No man hath
swich that in this world alyve is.  
<span id="an_41"></span> God woot, this noble kyng, as to my wit,  
<span id="an_42"></span> The firste nyght had many a myrie fit  
<span id="an_43"></span> With ech of hem, so wel was hym on lyve.  
<span id="an_44"></span> Yblessed be God that I have wedded fyve!  
<span id="an_44a"></span> \[Of whiche I have pyked out the beste,  
<span id="an_44b"></span> Bothe of here nether purs and of here
cheste.  
<span id="an_44c"></span> Diverse scoles maken parfyt clerkes,  
<span id="an_44d"></span> And diverse practyk in many sondry werkes  
<span id="an_44e"></span> Maketh the werkman parfyt sekirly;  
<span id="an_44f"></span> Of fyve husbondes scoleiyng am I.\]  
<span id="an_45"></span> Welcome the sixte, whan that evere he shal.  
<span id="an_46"></span> For sothe, I wol nat kepe me chaast in al.  
<span id="an_47"></span> Whan myn housbonde is fro the world ygon,  
<span id="an_48"></span> Som Cristen man shal wedde me anon,  
<span id="an_49"></span> For thanne th' apostle seith that I am free  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> To wedde, a
Goddes half, where it liketh me.  
<span id="an_51"></span> He seith that to be wedded is no synne;  
<span id="an_52"></span> Bet is to be wedded than to brynne.  
<span id="an_53"></span> What rekketh me, thogh folk seye vileynye  
<span id="an_54"></span> Of shrewed Lameth and his bigamye?  
<span id="an_55"></span> I woot wel Abraham was an hooly man,  
<span id="an_56"></span> And Jacob eek, as ferforth as I kan;  
<span id="an_57"></span> And ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two,  
<span id="an_58"></span> And many another holy man also.  
<span id="an_59"></span> Wher can ye seye, in any manere age,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> That hye God
defended mariage  
<span id="an_61"></span> By expres word? I pray yow, telleth me.  
<span id="an_62"></span> Or where comanded he virginitee?  
<span id="an_63"></span> I woot as wel as ye, it is no drede,  
<span id="an_64"></span> Th' apostel, whan he speketh of maydenhede,  
<span id="an_65"></span> He seyde that precept therof hadde he noon.  
<span id="an_66"></span> Men may conseille a womman to been oon,  
<span id="an_67"></span> But conseillyng is no comandement.  
<span id="an_68"></span> He putte it in oure owene juggement;  
<span id="an_69"></span> For hadde God comanded maydenhede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Thanne hadde he
dampned weddyng with the dede.  
<span id="an_71"></span> And certes, if ther were no seed ysowe,  
<span id="an_72"></span> Virginitee, thanne wherof sholde it growe?  
<span id="an_73"></span> Poul dorste nat comanden, atte leeste,  
<span id="an_74"></span> A thyng of which his maister yaf noon heeste.  
<span id="an_75"></span> The dart is set up for virginitee;  
<span id="an_76"></span> Cacche whoso may, who renneth best lat see.  
<span id="an_77"></span> But this word is nat taken of every wight,  
<span id="an_78"></span> But ther as God lust gyve it of his myght.  
<span id="an_79"></span> I woot wel that th' apostel was a mayde;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> But nathelees,
thogh that he wroot and sayde  
<span id="an_81"></span> He wolde that every wight were swich as he,  
<span id="an_82"></span> Al nys but conseil to virginitee.  
<span id="an_83"></span> And for to been a wyf he yaf me leve  
<span id="an_84"></span> Of indulgence; so nys it no repreve  
<span id="an_85"></span> To wedde me, if that my make dye,  
<span id="an_86"></span> Withouten excepcion of bigamye.  
<span id="an_87"></span> Al were it good no womman for to touche --  
<span id="an_88"></span> He mente as in his bed or in his couche,  
<span id="an_89"></span> For peril is bothe fyr and tow t' assemble;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Ye knowe what
this ensample may resemble.  
<span id="an_91"></span> This is al and som: he heeld virginitee  
<span id="an_92"></span> Moore parfit than weddyng in freletee.  
<span id="an_93"></span> Freletee clepe I, but if that he and she  
<span id="an_94"></span> Wolde leden al hir lyf in chastitee.  
<span id="an_95"></span> I graunte it wel; I have noon envie,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Thogh maydenhede preferre bigamye.  
<span id="an_97"></span> It liketh hem to be clene, body and goost;  
<span id="an_98"></span> Of myn estaat I nyl nat make no boost,  
<span id="an_99"></span> For wel ye knowe, a lord in his houshold,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> He nath nat
every vessel al of gold;  
<span id="an_101"></span> Somme been of tree, and doon hir lord
servyse.  
<span id="an_102"></span> God clepeth folk to hym in sondry wyse,  
<span id="an_103"></span> And everich hath of God a propre yifte --  
<span id="an_104"></span> Som this, som that, as hym liketh shifte.  
<span id="an_105"></span> Virginitee is greet perfeccion,  
<span id="an_106"></span> And continence eek with devocion,  
<span id="an_107"></span> But Crist, that of perfeccion is welle,  
<span id="an_108"></span> Bad nat every wight he sholde go selle  
<span id="an_109"></span> Al that he hadde, and gyve it to the poore,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> And in swich
wise folwe hym and his foore.  
<span id="an_111"></span> He spak to hem that wolde lyve parfitly;  
<span id="an_112"></span> And lordynges, by youre leve, that am nat I.  
<span id="an_113"></span> I wol bistowe the flour of al myn age  
<span id="an_114"></span> In the actes and in fruyt of mariage.  
<span id="an_115"></span> Telle me also, to what conclusion  
<span id="an_116"></span> Were membres maad of generacion,  
<span id="an_117"></span> And of so parfit wys a \[wright\] ywroght?  
<span id="an_118"></span> Trusteth right wel, they were nat maad for
noght.  
<span id="an_119"></span> Glose whoso wole, and seye bothe up and doun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> That they
were maked for purgacioun  
<span id="an_121"></span> Of uryne, and oure bothe thynges smale  
<span id="an_122"></span> Were eek to knowe a femele from a male,  
<span id="an_123"></span> And for noon oother cause -- say ye no?  
<span id="an_124"></span> The experience woot wel it is noght so.  
<span id="an_125"></span> So that the clerkes be nat with me wrothe,  
<span id="an_126"></span> I sey this: that they maked ben for bothe;  
<span id="an_127"></span> That is to seye, for office and for ese  
<span id="an_128"></span> Of engendrure, ther we nat God displese.  
<span id="an_129"></span> Why sholde men elles in hir bookes sette  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> That man shal
yelde to his wyf hire dette?  
<span id="an_131"></span> Now wherwith sholde he make his paiement,  
<span id="an_132"></span> If he ne used his sely instrument?  
<span id="an_133"></span> Thanne were they maad upon a creature  
<span id="an_134"></span> To purge uryne, and eek for engendrure.  
<span id="an_135"></span> But I seye noght that every wight is holde,  
<span id="an_136"></span> That hath swich harneys as I to yow tolde,  
<span id="an_137"></span> To goon and usen hem in engendrure.  
<span id="an_138"></span> Thanne sholde men take of chastitee no cure.  
<span id="an_139"></span> Crist was a mayde and shapen as a man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> And many a
seint, sith that the world bigan;  
<span id="an_141"></span> Yet lyved they evere in parfit chastitee.  
<span id="an_142"></span> I nyl envye no virginitee.  
<span id="an_143"></span> Lat hem be breed of pured whete-seed,  
<span id="an_144"></span> And lat us wyves hoten barly-breed;  
<span id="an_145"></span> And yet with barly-breed, Mark telle kan,  
<span id="an_146"></span> Oure Lord Jhesu refresshed many a man.  
<span id="an_147"></span> In swich estaat as God hath cleped us  
<span id="an_148"></span> I wol persevere; I nam nat precius.  
<span id="an_149"></span> In wyfhod I wol use myn instrument  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> As frely as
my Makere hath it sent.  
<span id="an_151"></span> If I be daungerous, God yeve me sorwe!  
<span id="an_152"></span> Myn housbonde shal it have bothe eve and
morwe,  
<span id="an_153"></span> Whan that hym list come forth and paye his
dette.  
<span id="an_154"></span> An housbonde I wol have -- I wol nat lette
--  
<span id="an_155"></span> Which shal be bothe my dettour and my thral,  
<span id="an_156"></span> And have his tribulacion withal  
<span id="an_157"></span> Upon his flessh, whil that I am his wyf.  
<span id="an_158"></span> I have the power durynge al my lyf  
<span id="an_159"></span> Upon his propre body, and noght he.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> Right thus
the Apostel tolde it unto me,  
<span id="an_161"></span> And bad oure housbondes for to love us weel.  
<span id="an_162"></span> Al this sentence me liketh every deel" --  
<span id="an_163"></span> Up stirte the Pardoner, and that anon;  
<span id="an_164"></span> "Now, dame," quod he, "by God and by Seint
John!  
<span id="an_165"></span> Ye been a noble prechour in this cas.  
<span id="an_166"></span> I was aboute to wedde a wyf; allas!  
<span id="an_167"></span> What sholde I bye it on my flessh so deere?  
<span id="an_168"></span> Yet hadde I levere wedde no wyf to-yeere!"  
<span id="an_169"></span> "Abyde!" quod she, "my tale is nat bigonne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> Nay, thou

<span id="an_172"></span> And whan that I have toold thee forth my
tale  
<span id="an_173"></span> Of tribulacion in mariage,  
<span id="an_174"></span> Of which I am expert in al myn age --  
<span id="an_175"></span> This is to seyn, myself have been the whippe

<span id="an_181"></span> By hym shul othere men corrected be.'  
<span id="an_182"></span> The same wordes writeth Ptholomee;  
<span id="an_183"></span> Rede in his Almageste, and take it there."  
<span id="an_184"></span> "Dame, I wolde praye yow, if youre wyl it
were,"  
<span id="an_185"></span> Seyde this Pardoner, "as ye bigan,  
<span id="an_186"></span> Telle forth youre tale, spareth for no man,  
<span id="an_187"></span> And teche us yonge men of youre praktike."  
<span id="an_188"></span> "Gladly," quod she, "sith it may yow like;  
<span id="an_189"></span> But yet I praye to al this compaignye,

<span id="an_192"></span> For myn entente nys but for to pleye.  
<span id="an_193"></span> Now, sire, now wol I telle forth my tale.  
<span id="an_194"></span> As evere moote I drynken wyn or ale,  
<span id="an_195"></span> I shal seye sooth; tho housbondes that I

<span id="an_197"></span> The thre were goode men, and riche, and
olde;  
<span id="an_198"></span> Unnethe myghte they the statut holde  
<span id="an_199"></span> In which that they were bounden unto me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Ye woot wel
what I meene of this, pardee!  
<span id="an_201"></span> As help me God, I laughe whan I thynke  
<span id="an_202"></span> How pitously a-nyght I made hem swynke!  
<span id="an_203"></span> And, by my fey, I tolde of it no stoor.  
<span id="an_204"></span> They had me yeven hir lond and hir tresoor;  
<span id="an_205"></span> Me neded nat do lenger diligence  
<span id="an_206"></span> To wynne hir love, or doon hem reverence.  
<span id="an_207"></span> They loved me so wel, by God above,

<span id="an_215"></span> I sette hem so a-werke, by my fey,

<span id="an_217"></span> The bacon was nat fet for hem, I trowe,  
<span id="an_218"></span> That som men han in Essex at Dunmowe.  
<span id="an_219"></span> I governed hem so wel, after my lawe,

<span id="an_221"></span> To brynge me gaye thynges fro the fayre.  
<span id="an_222"></span> They were ful glad whan I spak to hem faire,

<span id="an_224"></span> Now herkneth hou I baar me proprely,

<span id="an_231"></span> A wys wyf, if that she kan hir good,

<span id="an_262"></span> Thus goth al to the devel, by thy tale.  
<span id="an_263"></span> Thou seyst men may nat kepe a castel wal,  
<span id="an_264"></span> It may so longe assailled been overal.  
<span id="an_265"></span> And if that she be foul, thou seist that she  
<span id="an_266"></span> Coveiteth every man that she may se,  
<span id="an_267"></span> For as a spanyel she wol on hym lepe,  
<span id="an_268"></span> Til that she fynde som man hire to chepe.  
<span id="an_269"></span> Ne noon so grey goos gooth ther in the lake  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> As, seistow,

<span id="an_271"></span> And seyst it is an hard thyng for to welde  
<span id="an_272"></span> A thyng that no man wole, his thankes,
helde.  
<span id="an_273"></span> Thus seistow, lorel, whan thow goost to

<span id="an_274"></span> And that no wys man nedeth for to wedde,  
<span id="an_275"></span> Ne no man that entendeth unto hevene.  
<span id="an_276"></span> With wilde thonder-dynt and firy levene  
<span id="an_277"></span> Moote thy welked nekke be tobroke!  
<span id="an_278"></span> Thow seyst that droppyng houses, and eek

<span id="an_279"></span> And chidyng wyves maken men to flee  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> Out of hir

<span id="an_281"></span> What eyleth swich an old man for to chide?  
<span id="an_282"></span> Thow seyst we wyves wol oure vices hide  
<span id="an_283"></span> Til we be fast, and thanne we wol hem shewe
--  
<span id="an_284"></span> Wel may that be a proverbe of a shrewe!  
<span id="an_285"></span> Thou seist that oxen, asses, hors, and
houndes,  
<span id="an_286"></span> They been assayed at diverse stoundes;  
<span id="an_287"></span> Bacyns, lavours, er that men hem bye,  
<span id="an_288"></span> Spoones and stooles, and al swich

<span id="an_289"></span> And so been pottes, clothes, and array;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> But folk of

<span id="an_291"></span> Til they be wedded -- olde dotard shrewe! --  
<span id="an_292"></span> And thanne, seistow, we wol oure vices
shewe.  
<span id="an_293"></span> Thou seist also that it displeseth me  
<span id="an_294"></span> But if that thou wolt preyse my beautee,  
<span id="an_295"></span> And but thou poure alwey upon my face,  
<span id="an_296"></span> And clepe me "faire dame" in every place.  
<span id="an_297"></span> And but thou make a feeste on thilke day  
<span id="an_298"></span> That I was born, and make me fressh and gay;  
<span id="an_299"></span> And but thou do to my norice honour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> And to my

<span id="an_301"></span> And to my fadres folk and his allyes --  
<span id="an_302"></span> Thus seistow, olde barel-ful of lyes!  
<span id="an_303"></span> And yet of oure apprentice Janekyn,  
<span id="an_304"></span> For his crispe heer, shynynge as gold so
fyn,  
<span id="an_305"></span> And for he squiereth me bothe up and doun,  
<span id="an_306"></span> Yet hastow caught a fals suspecioun.  
<span id="an_307"></span> I wol hym noght, thogh thou were deed

<span id="an_308"></span> But tel me this: why hydestow, with sorwe,  
<span id="an_309"></span> The keyes of thy cheste awey fro me?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310">310</span></span> It is my good
as wel as thyn, pardee!  
<span id="an_311"></span> What, wenestow make an ydiot of oure dame?  
<span id="an_312"></span> Now by that lord that called is Seint Jame,  
<span id="an_313"></span> Thou shalt nat bothe, thogh that thou were
wood,  
<span id="an_314"></span> Be maister of my body and of my good;  
<span id="an_315"></span> That oon thou shalt forgo, maugree thyne
yen.  
<span id="an_316"></span> What helpith it of me to enquere or spyen?  
<span id="an_317"></span> I trowe thou woldest loke me in thy chiste!  
<span id="an_318"></span> Thou sholdest seye, "Wyf, go wher thee
liste;  
<span id="an_319"></span> Taak youre disport; I wol nat leve no talys.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> I knowe yow

<span id="an_321"></span> We love no man that taketh kep or charge  
<span id="an_322"></span> Wher that we goon; we wol ben at oure large.  
<span id="an_323"></span> Of alle men yblessed moot he be,  
<span id="an_324"></span> The wise astrologien, Daun Ptholome,  
<span id="an_325"></span> That seith this proverbe in his Almageste:  
<span id="an_326"></span> "Of alle men his wysdom is the hyeste  
<span id="an_327"></span> That rekketh nevere who hath the world in
honde."  
<span id="an_328"></span> By this proverbe thou shalt understonde,  
<span id="an_329"></span> Have thou ynogh, what thar thee recche or
care  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> How myrily
that othere folkes fare?  
<span id="an_331"></span> For, certeyn, olde dotard, by youre leve,  
<span id="an_332"></span> Ye shul have queynte right ynogh at eve.  
<span id="an_333"></span> He is to greet a nygard that wolde werne  
<span id="an_334"></span> A man to lighte a candle at his lanterne;  
<span id="an_335"></span> He shal have never the lasse light, pardee.  
<span id="an_336"></span> Have thou ynogh, thee thar nat pleyne thee.  
<span id="an_337"></span> Thou seyst also, that if we make us gay  
<span id="an_338"></span> With clothyng, and with precious array,  
<span id="an_339"></span> That it is peril of oure chastitee;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> And yet --
with sorwe! -- thou most enforce thee,  
<span id="an_341"></span> And seye thise wordes in the Apostles name:  
<span id="an_342"></span> "In habit maad with chastitee and shame  
<span id="an_343"></span> Ye wommen shul apparaille yow," quod he,  
<span id="an_344"></span> "And noght in tressed heer and gay perree,  
<span id="an_345"></span> As perles, ne with gold, ne clothes riche."  
<span id="an_346"></span> After thy text, ne after thy rubriche,  
<span id="an_347"></span> I wol nat wirche as muchel as a gnat.  
<span id="an_348"></span> Thou seydest this, that I was lyk a cat;  
<span id="an_349"></span> For whoso wolde senge a cattes skyn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> Thanne wolde
the cat wel dwellen in his in;  
<span id="an_351"></span> And if the cattes skyn be slyk and gay,  
<span id="an_352"></span> She wol nat dwelle in house half a day,  
<span id="an_353"></span> But forth she wole, er any day be dawed,  
<span id="an_354"></span> To shewe hir skyn and goon a-caterwawed.  
<span id="an_355"></span> This is to seye, if I be gay, sire shrewe,  
<span id="an_356"></span> I wol renne out my borel for to shewe.  
<span id="an_357"></span> Sire olde fool, what helpeth thee to spyen?  
<span id="an_358"></span> Thogh thou preye Argus with his hundred yen  
<span id="an_359"></span> To be my warde-cors, as he kan best,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> In feith, he
shal nat kepe me but me lest;  
<span id="an_361"></span> Yet koude I make his berd, so moot I thee!  
<span id="an_362"></span> Thou seydest eek that ther been thynges
thre,  
<span id="an_363"></span> The whiche thynges troublen al this erthe,  
<span id="an_364"></span> And that no wight may endure the ferthe.  
<span id="an_365"></span> O leeve sire shrewe, Jhesu shorte thy lyf!  
<span id="an_366"></span> Yet prechestow and seyst an hateful wyf  
<span id="an_367"></span> Yrekened is for oon of thise meschances.  
<span id="an_368"></span> Been ther none othere maner resemblances  
<span id="an_369"></span> That ye may likne youre parables to,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> But if a sely
wyf be oon of tho?  
<span id="an_371"></span> Thou liknest eek wommenes love to helle,  
<span id="an_372"></span> To bareyne lond, ther water may nat dwelle.  
<span id="an_373"></span> Thou liknest it also to wilde fyr;  
<span id="an_374"></span> The moore it brenneth, the moore it hath
desir  
<span id="an_375"></span> To consume every thyng that brent wole be.  
<span id="an_376"></span> Thou seyest, right as wormes shende a tree,  
<span id="an_377"></span> Right so a wyf destroyeth hire housbonde;  
<span id="an_378"></span> This knowe they that been to wyves bonde.'  
<span id="an_379"></span> Lordynges, right thus, as ye have
understonde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> Baar I stifly
myne olde housbondes on honde  
<span id="an_381"></span> That thus they seyden in hir dronkenesse;  
<span id="an_382"></span> And al was fals, but that I took witnesse  
<span id="an_383"></span> On Janekyn, and on my nece also.  
<span id="an_384"></span> O Lord! The peyne I dide hem and the wo,  
<span id="an_385"></span> Ful giltelees, by Goddes sweete pyne!  
<span id="an_386"></span> For as an hors I koude byte and whyne.  
<span id="an_387"></span> I koude pleyne, and yit was in the gilt,  
<span id="an_388"></span> Or elles often tyme hadde I been spilt.  
<span id="an_389"></span> Whoso that first to mille comth, first
grynt;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> I pleyned
first, so was oure werre ystynt.  
<span id="an_391"></span> They were ful glade to excuse hem blyve  
<span id="an_392"></span> Of thyng of which they nevere agilte hir
lyve.  
<span id="an_393"></span> Of wenches wolde I beren hem on honde,  
<span id="an_394"></span> Whan that for syk unnethes myghte they
stonde.  
<span id="an_395"></span> Yet tikled I his herte, for that he  
<span id="an_396"></span> Wende that I hadde of hym so greet chiertee!  
<span id="an_397"></span> I swoor that al my walkynge out by nyghte  
<span id="an_398"></span> Was for t' espye wenches that he dighte;  
<span id="an_399"></span> Under that colour hadde I many a myrthe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> For al swich
wit is yeven us in oure byrthe;  
<span id="an_401"></span> Deceite, wepyng, spynnyng God hath yive  
<span id="an_402"></span> To wommen kyndely, whil that they may lyve.  
<span id="an_403"></span> And thus of o thyng I avaunte me:  
<span id="an_404"></span> Atte ende I hadde the bettre in ech degree,  
<span id="an_405"></span> By sleighte, or force, or by som maner
thyng,  
<span id="an_406"></span> As by continueel murmur or grucchyng.  
<span id="an_407"></span> Namely abedde hadden they meschaunce:  
<span id="an_408"></span> Ther wolde I chide and do hem no plesaunce;  
<span id="an_409"></span> I wolde no lenger in the bed abyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> If that I
felte his arm over my syde,  
<span id="an_411"></span> Til he had maad his raunson unto me;  
<span id="an_412"></span> Thanne wolde I suffre hym do his nycetee.  
<span id="an_413"></span> And therfore every man this tale I telle,  
<span id="an_414"></span> Wynne whoso may, for al is for to selle;  
<span id="an_415"></span> With empty hand men may none haukes lure.  
<span id="an_416"></span> For wynnyng wolde I al his lust endure,  
<span id="an_417"></span> And make me a feyned appetit;  
<span id="an_418"></span> And yet in bacon hadde I nevere delit.  
<span id="an_419"></span> That made me that evere I wolde hem chide,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> For thogh the
pope hadde seten hem biside,  
<span id="an_421"></span> I wolde nat spare hem at hir owene bord,  
<span id="an_422"></span> For, by my trouthe, I quitte hem word for
word.  
<span id="an_423"></span> As helpe me verray God omnipotent,  
<span id="an_424"></span> Though I right now sholde make my testament,  
<span id="an_425"></span> I ne owe hem nat a word that it nys quit.  
<span id="an_426"></span> I broghte it so aboute by my wit  
<span id="an_427"></span> That they moste yeve it up, as for the
beste,  
<span id="an_428"></span> Or elles hadde we nevere been in reste;  
<span id="an_429"></span> For thogh he looked as a wood leon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> Yet sholde he
faille of his conclusion.  
<span id="an_431"></span> Thanne wolde I seye, \`Goode lief, taak keep  
<span id="an_432"></span> How mekely looketh Wilkyn, oure sheep!  
<span id="an_433"></span> Com neer, my spouse, lat me ba thy cheke!  
<span id="an_434"></span> Ye sholde been al pacient and meke,  
<span id="an_435"></span> And han a sweete spiced conscience,  
<span id="an_436"></span> Sith ye so preche of Jobes pacience.  
<span id="an_437"></span> Suffreth alwey, syn ye so wel kan preche;  
<span id="an_438"></span> And but ye do, certein we shal yow teche  
<span id="an_439"></span> That it is fair to have a wyf in pees.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> Oon of us two
moste bowen, doutelees,  
<span id="an_441"></span> And sith a man is moore resonable  
<span id="an_442"></span> Than womman is, ye moste been suffrable.  
<span id="an_443"></span> What eyleth yow to grucche thus and grone?  
<span id="an_444"></span> Is it for ye wolde have my queynte allone?  
<span id="an_445"></span> Wy, taak it al! Lo, have it every deel!  
<span id="an_446"></span> Peter! I shrewe yow, but ye love it weel;  
<span id="an_447"></span> For if I wolde selle my bele chose,  
<span id="an_448"></span> I koude walke as fressh as is a rose;  
<span id="an_449"></span> But I wol kepe it for youre owene tooth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> Ye be to
blame, by God! I sey yow sooth.'  
<span id="an_451"></span> Swiche manere wordes hadde we on honde.  
<span id="an_452"></span> Now wol I speken of my fourthe housbonde.  
<span id="an_453"></span> My fourthe housbonde was a revelour --  
<span id="an_454"></span> This is to seyn, he hadde a paramour --  
<span id="an_455"></span> And I was yong and ful of ragerye,  
<span id="an_456"></span> Stibourn and strong, and joly as a pye.  
<span id="an_457"></span> How koude I daunce to an harpe smale,  
<span id="an_458"></span> And synge, ywis, as any nyghtyngale,  
<span id="an_459"></span> Whan I had dronke a draughte of sweete wyn!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> Metellius,
the foule cherl, the swyn,  
<span id="an_461"></span> That with a staf birafte his wyf hir lyf,  
<span id="an_462"></span> For she drank wyn, thogh I hadde been his
wyf,  
<span id="an_463"></span> He sholde nat han daunted me fro drynke!  
<span id="an_464"></span> And after wyn on Venus moste I thynke,  
<span id="an_465"></span> For al so siker as cold engendreth hayl,  
<span id="an_466"></span> A likerous mouth moste han a likerous tayl.  
<span id="an_467"></span> In wommen vinolent is no defence --  
<span id="an_468"></span> This knowen lecchours by experience.  
<span id="an_469"></span> But -- Lord Crist! -- whan that it remembreth
me  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> Upon my
yowthe, and on my jolitee,  
<span id="an_471"></span> It tikleth me aboute myn herte roote.  
<span id="an_472"></span> Unto this day it dooth myn herte boote  
<span id="an_473"></span> That I have had my world as in my tyme.  
<span id="an_474"></span> But age, allas, that al wole envenyme,  
<span id="an_475"></span> Hath me biraft my beautee and my pith.  
<span id="an_476"></span> Lat go. Farewel! The devel go therwith!  
<span id="an_477"></span> The flour is goon; ther is namoore to telle;  
<span id="an_478"></span> The bren, as I best kan, now moste I selle;  
<span id="an_479"></span> But yet to be right myrie wol I fonde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> Now wol I
tellen of my fourthe housbonde.  
<span id="an_481"></span> I seye, I hadde in herte greet despit  
<span id="an_482"></span> That he of any oother had delit.  
<span id="an_483"></span> But he was quit, by God and by Seint Joce!  
<span id="an_484"></span> I made hym of the same wode a croce;  
<span id="an_485"></span> Nat of my body, in no foul manere,  
<span id="an_486"></span> But certeinly, I made folk swich cheere  
<span id="an_487"></span> That in his owene grece I made hym frye  
<span id="an_488"></span> For angre, and for verray jalousye.  
<span id="an_489"></span> By God, in erthe I was his purgatorie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> For which I
hope his soule be in glorie.  
<span id="an_491"></span> For, God it woot, he sat ful ofte and song,  
<span id="an_492"></span> Whan that his shoo ful bitterly hym wrong.  
<span id="an_493"></span> Ther was no wight, save God and he, that
wiste,  
<span id="an_494"></span> In many wise, how soore I hym twiste.  
<span id="an_495"></span> He deyde whan I cam fro Jerusalem,  
<span id="an_496"></span> And lith ygrave under the roode beem,  
<span id="an_497"></span> Al is his tombe noght so curyus  
<span id="an_498"></span> As was the sepulcre of hym Daryus,  
<span id="an_499"></span> Which that Appelles wroghte subtilly;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> It nys but
wast to burye hym preciously.  
<span id="an_501"></span> Lat hym fare wel; God yeve his soule reste!  
<span id="an_502"></span> He is now in his grave and in his cheste.  
<span id="an_503"></span> Now of my fifthe housbonde wol I telle.  
<span id="an_504"></span> God lete his soule nevere come in helle!  
<span id="an_505"></span> And yet was he to me the mooste shrewe;  
<span id="an_506"></span> That feele I on my ribbes al by rewe,  
<span id="an_507"></span> And evere shal unto myn endyng day.  
<span id="an_508"></span> But in oure bed he was so fressh and gay,  
<span id="an_509"></span> And therwithal so wel koude he me glose,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> Whan that he
wolde han my bele chose;  
<span id="an_511"></span> That thogh he hadde me bete on every bon,  
<span id="an_512"></span> He koude wynne agayn my love anon.  
<span id="an_513"></span> I trowe I loved hym best, for that he  
<span id="an_514"></span> Was of his love daungerous to me.  
<span id="an_515"></span> We wommen han, if that I shal nat lye,  
<span id="an_516"></span> In this matere a queynte fantasye:  
<span id="an_517"></span> Wayte what thyng we may nat lightly have,  
<span id="an_518"></span> Therafter wol we crie al day and crave.  
<span id="an_519"></span> Forbede us thyng, and that desiren we;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> Preesse on us
faste, and thanne wol we fle.  
<span id="an_521"></span> With daunger oute we al oure chaffare;  
<span id="an_522"></span> Greet prees at market maketh deere ware,  
<span id="an_523"></span> And to greet cheep is holde at litel prys:  
<span id="an_524"></span> This knoweth every womman that is wys.  
<span id="an_525"></span> My fifthe housbonde -- God his soule blesse!
--  
<span id="an_526"></span> Which that I took for love, and no richesse,  
<span id="an_527"></span> He som tyme was a clerk of Oxenford,  
<span id="an_528"></span> And hadde left scole, and wente at hom to
bord  
<span id="an_529"></span> With my gossib, dwellynge in oure toun;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> God have hir
soule! Hir name was Alisoun.  
<span id="an_531"></span> She knew myn herte, and eek my privetee,  
<span id="an_532"></span> Bet than oure parisshe preest, so moot I
thee!  
<span id="an_533"></span> To hire biwreyed I my conseil al.  
<span id="an_534"></span> For hadde myn housbonde pissed on a wal,  
<span id="an_535"></span> Or doon a thyng that sholde han cost his
lyf,  
<span id="an_536"></span> To hire, and to another worthy wyf,  
<span id="an_537"></span> And to my nece, which that I loved weel,  
<span id="an_538"></span> I wolde han toold his conseil every deel.  
<span id="an_539"></span> And so I dide ful often, God it woot,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> That made his
face often reed and hoot  
<span id="an_541"></span> For verray shame, and blamed hymself for he  
<span id="an_542"></span> Had toold to me so greet a pryvetee.  
<span id="an_543"></span> And so bifel that ones in a Lente --  
<span id="an_544"></span> So often tymes I to my gossyb wente,  
<span id="an_545"></span> For evere yet I loved to be gay,  
<span id="an_546"></span> And for to walke in March, Averill, and May,  
<span id="an_547"></span> Fro hous to hous, to heere sondry talys --  
<span id="an_548"></span> That Jankyn clerk, and my gossyb dame Alys,  
<span id="an_549"></span> And I myself, into the feeldes wente.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> Myn housbonde
was at Londoun al that Lente;  
<span id="an_551"></span> I hadde the bettre leyser for to pleye,  
<span id="an_552"></span> And for to se, and eek for to be seye  
<span id="an_553"></span> Of lusty folk. What wiste I wher my grace  
<span id="an_554"></span> Was shapen for to be, or in what place?  
<span id="an_555"></span> Therfore I made my visitaciouns  
<span id="an_556"></span> To vigilies and to processiouns,  
<span id="an_557"></span> To prechyng eek, and to thise pilgrimages,  
<span id="an_558"></span> To pleyes of myracles, and to mariages,  
<span id="an_559"></span> And wered upon my gaye scarlet gytes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> Thise wormes,
ne thise motthes, ne thise mytes,  
<span id="an_561"></span> Upon my peril, frete hem never a deel;  
<span id="an_562"></span> And wostow why? For they were used weel.  
<span id="an_563"></span> Now wol I tellen forth what happed me.  
<span id="an_564"></span> I seye that in the feeldes walked we,  
<span id="an_565"></span> Til trewely we hadde swich daliance,  
<span id="an_566"></span> This clerk and I, that of my purveiance  
<span id="an_567"></span> I spak to hym and seyde hym how that he,  
<span id="an_568"></span> If I were wydwe, sholde wedde me.  
<span id="an_569"></span> For certeinly -- I sey for no bobance --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> Yet was I
nevere withouten purveiance  
<span id="an_571"></span> Of mariage, n' of othere thynges eek.  
<span id="an_572"></span> I holde a mouses herte nat worth a leek  
<span id="an_573"></span> That hath but oon hole for to sterte to,  
<span id="an_574"></span> And if that faille, thanne is al ydo.  
<span id="an_575"></span> I bar hym on honde he hadde enchanted me --  
<span id="an_576"></span> My dame taughte me that soutiltee --  
<span id="an_577"></span> And eek I seyde I mette of hym al nyght,  
<span id="an_578"></span> He wolde han slayn me as I lay upright,  
<span id="an_579"></span> And al my bed was ful of verray blood;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> \`But yet I
hope that ye shal do me good,  
<span id="an_581"></span> For blood bitokeneth gold, as me was
taught.'  
<span id="an_582"></span> And al was fals; I dremed of it right
naught,  
<span id="an_583"></span> But as I folwed ay my dames loore,  
<span id="an_584"></span> As wel of this as of othere thynges moore.  
<span id="an_585"></span> But now, sire, lat me se what I shal seyn.  
<span id="an_586"></span> A ha! By God, I have my tale ageyn.  
<span id="an_587"></span> Whan that my fourthe housbonde was on beere,  
<span id="an_588"></span> I weep algate, and made sory cheere,  
<span id="an_589"></span> As wyves mooten, for it is usage,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> And with my
coverchief covered my visage,  
<span id="an_591"></span> But for that I was purveyed of a make,  
<span id="an_592"></span> I wepte but smal, and that I undertake.  
<span id="an_593"></span> To chirche was myn housbonde born a-morwe  
<span id="an_594"></span> With neighebores, that for hym maden sorwe;  
<span id="an_595"></span> And Jankyn, oure clerk, was oon of tho.  
<span id="an_596"></span> As help me God, whan that I saugh hym go  
<span id="an_597"></span> After the beere, me thoughte he hadde a
paire  
<span id="an_598"></span> Of legges and of feet so clene and faire  
<span id="an_599"></span> That al myn herte I yaf unto his hoold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> He was, I
trowe, twenty wynter oold,  
<span id="an_601"></span> And I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth;  
<span id="an_602"></span> But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth.  
<span id="an_603"></span> Gat-tothed I was, and that bicam me weel;  
<span id="an_604"></span> I hadde the prente of seinte Venus seel.  
<span id="an_605"></span> As help me God, I was a lusty oon,  
<span id="an_606"></span> And faire, and riche, and yong, and wel
bigon,  
<span id="an_607"></span> And trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me,  
<span id="an_608"></span> I hadde the beste quoniam myghte be.  
<span id="an_609"></span> For certes, I am al Venerien  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> In feelynge,
and myn herte is Marcien.  
<span id="an_611"></span> Venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse,  
<span id="an_612"></span> And Mars yaf me my sturdy hardynesse;  
<span id="an_613"></span> Myn ascendent was Taur, and Mars therinne.  
<span id="an_614"></span> Allas, allas! That evere love was synne!  
<span id="an_615"></span> I folwed ay myn inclinacioun  
<span id="an_616"></span> By vertu of my constellacioun;  
<span id="an_617"></span> That made me I koude noght withdrawe  
<span id="an_618"></span> My chambre of Venus from a good felawe.  
<span id="an_619"></span> Yet have I Martes mark upon my face,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> And also in
another privee place.  
<span id="an_621"></span> For God so wys be my savacioun,  
<span id="an_622"></span> I ne loved nevere by no discrecioun,  
<span id="an_623"></span> But evere folwede myn appetit,  
<span id="an_624"></span> Al were he short, or long, or blak, or whit;  
<span id="an_625"></span> I took no kep, so that he liked me,  
<span id="an_626"></span> How poore he was, ne eek of what degree.  
<span id="an_627"></span> What sholde I seye but, at the monthes ende,  
<span id="an_628"></span> This joly clerk, Jankyn, that was so hende,  
<span id="an_629"></span> Hath wedded me with greet solempnytee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> And to hym
yaf I al the lond and fee  
<span id="an_631"></span> That evere was me yeven therbifoore.  
<span id="an_632"></span> But afterward repented me ful soore;  
<span id="an_633"></span> He nolde suffre nothyng of my list.  
<span id="an_634"></span> By God, he smoot me ones on the lyst,  
<span id="an_635"></span> For that I rente out of his book a leef,  
<span id="an_636"></span> That of the strook myn ere wax al deef.  
<span id="an_637"></span> Stibourn I was as is a leonesse,  
<span id="an_638"></span> And of my tonge a verray jangleresse,  
<span id="an_639"></span> And walke I wolde, as I had doon biforn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> From hous to
hous, although he had it sworn;  
<span id="an_641"></span> For which he often tymes wolde preche,  
<span id="an_642"></span> And me of olde Romayn geestes teche;  
<span id="an_643"></span> How he Symplicius Gallus lefte his wyf,  
<span id="an_644"></span> And hire forsook for terme of al his lyf,  
<span id="an_645"></span> Noght but for open-heveded he hir say  
<span id="an_646"></span> Lookynge out at his dore upon a day.  
<span id="an_647"></span> Another Romayn tolde he me by name,  
<span id="an_648"></span> That, for his wyf was at a someres game  
<span id="an_649"></span> Withouten his wityng, he forsook hire eke.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> And thanne
wolde he upon his Bible seke  
<span id="an_651"></span> That ilke proverbe of Ecclesiaste  
<span id="an_652"></span> Where he comandeth and forbedeth faste  
<span id="an_653"></span> Man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute.  
<span id="an_654"></span> Thanne wolde he seye right thus, withouten
doute:  
<span id="an_655"></span> \`Whoso that buyldeth his hous al of salwes,  
<span id="an_656"></span> And priketh his blynde hors over the falwes,  
<span id="an_657"></span> And suffreth his wyf to go seken halwes,  
<span id="an_658"></span> Is worthy to been hanged on the galwes!'  
<span id="an_659"></span> But al for noght, I sette noght an hawe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> Of his
proverbes n' of his olde sawe,  
<span id="an_661"></span> Ne I wolde nat of hym corrected be.  
<span id="an_662"></span> I hate hym that my vices telleth me,  
<span id="an_663"></span> And so doo mo, God woot, of us than I.  
<span id="an_664"></span> This made hym with me wood al outrely;  
<span id="an_665"></span> I nolde noght forbere hym in no cas.  
<span id="an_666"></span> Now wol I seye yow sooth, by Seint Thomas,  
<span id="an_667"></span> Why that I rente out of his book a leef,  
<span id="an_668"></span> For which he smoot me so that I was deef.  
<span id="an_669"></span> He hadde a book that gladly, nyght and day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> For his
desport he wolde rede alway;  
<span id="an_671"></span> He cleped it Valerie and Theofraste,  
<span id="an_672"></span> At which book he lough alwey ful faste.  
<span id="an_673"></span> And eek ther was somtyme a clerk at Rome,  
<span id="an_674"></span> A cardinal, that highte Seint Jerome,  
<span id="an_675"></span> That made a book agayn Jovinian;  
<span id="an_676"></span> In which book eek ther was Tertulan,  
<span id="an_677"></span> Crisippus, Trotula, and Helowys,  
<span id="an_678"></span> That was abbesse nat fer fro Parys,  
<span id="an_679"></span> And eek the Parables of Salomon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> Ovides Art,
and bookes many on,  
<span id="an_681"></span> And alle thise were bounden in o volume.  
<span id="an_682"></span> And every nyght and day was his custume,  
<span id="an_683"></span> Whan he hadde leyser and vacacioun  
<span id="an_684"></span> From oother worldly occupacioun,  
<span id="an_685"></span> To reden on this book of wikked wyves.  
<span id="an_686"></span> He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves  
<span id="an_687"></span> Than been of goode wyves in the Bible.  
<span id="an_688"></span> For trusteth wel, it is an impossible  
<span id="an_689"></span> That any clerk wol speke good of wyves,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> But if it be
of hooly seintes lyves,  
<span id="an_691"></span> Ne of noon oother womman never the mo.  
<span id="an_692"></span> Who peyntede the leon, tel me who?  
<span id="an_693"></span> By God, if wommen hadde writen stories,  
<span id="an_694"></span> As clerkes han withinne hire oratories,  
<span id="an_695"></span> They wolde han writen of men moore
wikkednesse  
<span id="an_696"></span> Than al the mark of Adam may redresse.  
<span id="an_697"></span> The children of Mercurie and of Venus  
<span id="an_698"></span> Been in hir wirkyng ful contrarius;  
<span id="an_699"></span> Mercurie loveth wysdam and science,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> And Venus
loveth ryot and dispence.  
<span id="an_701"></span> And, for hire diverse disposicioun,  
<span id="an_702"></span> Ech falleth in otheres exaltacioun.  
<span id="an_703"></span> And thus, God woot, Mercurie is desolat  
<span id="an_704"></span> In Pisces, wher Venus is exaltat,  
<span id="an_705"></span> And Venus falleth ther Mercurie is reysed.  
<span id="an_706"></span> Therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed.  
<span id="an_707"></span> The clerk, whan he is oold, and may noght do  
<span id="an_708"></span> Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho,  
<span id="an_709"></span> Thanne sit he doun, and writ in his dotage  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> That wommen
kan nat kepe hir mariage!  
<span id="an_711"></span> But now to purpos, why I tolde thee  
<span id="an_712"></span> That I was beten for a book, pardee!  
<span id="an_713"></span> Upon a nyght Jankyn, that was oure sire,  
<span id="an_714"></span> Redde on his book, as he sat by the fire,  
<span id="an_715"></span> Of Eva first, that for hir wikkednesse  
<span id="an_716"></span> Was al mankynde broght to wrecchednesse,  
<span id="an_717"></span> For which that Jhesu Crist hymself was
slayn,  
<span id="an_718"></span> That boghte us with his herte blood agayn.  
<span id="an_719"></span> Lo, heere expres of womman may ye fynde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> That womman
was the los of al mankynde.  
<span id="an_721"></span> Tho redde he me how Sampson loste his heres:  
<span id="an_722"></span> Slepynge, his lemman kitte it with hir
sheres;  
<span id="an_723"></span> Thurgh which treson loste he bothe his yen.  
<span id="an_724"></span> Tho redde he me, if that I shal nat lyen,  
<span id="an_725"></span> Of Hercules and of his Dianyre,  
<span id="an_726"></span> That caused hym to sette hymself afyre.  
<span id="an_727"></span> No thyng forgat he the care and the wo  
<span id="an_728"></span> That Socrates hadde with his wyves two,  
<span id="an_729"></span> How Xantippa caste pisse upon his heed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730">730</span></span> This sely man
sat stille as he were deed;  
<span id="an_731"></span> He wiped his heed, namoore dorste he seyn,  
<span id="an_732"></span> But \`Er that thonder stynte, comth a reyn!'  
<span id="an_733"></span> Of Phasipha, that was the queene of Crete,  
<span id="an_734"></span> For shrewednesse, hym thoughte the tale
swete;  
<span id="an_735"></span> Fy! Spek namoore -- it is a grisly thyng --  
<span id="an_736"></span> Of hire horrible lust and hir likyng.  
<span id="an_737"></span> Of Clitermystra, for hire lecherye,  
<span id="an_738"></span> That falsly made hire housbonde for to dye,  
<span id="an_739"></span> He redde it with ful good devocioun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> He tolde me
eek for what occasioun  
<span id="an_741"></span> Amphiorax at Thebes loste his lyf.  
<span id="an_742"></span> Myn housbonde hadde a legende of his wyf,  
<span id="an_743"></span> Eriphilem, that for an ouche of gold  
<span id="an_744"></span> Hath prively unto the Grekes told  
<span id="an_745"></span> Wher that hir housbonde hidde hym in a
place,  
<span id="an_746"></span> For which he hadde at Thebes sory grace.  
<span id="an_747"></span> Of Lyvia tolde he me, and of Lucye:  
<span id="an_748"></span> They bothe made hir housbondes for to dye,  
<span id="an_749"></span> That oon for love, that oother was for hate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> Lyvia hir
housbonde, on an even late,  
<span id="an_751"></span> Empoysoned hath, for that she was his fo;  
<span id="an_752"></span> Lucia, likerous, loved hire housbonde so  
<span id="an_753"></span> That, for he sholde alwey upon hire thynke,  
<span id="an_754"></span> She yaf hym swich a manere love-drynke  
<span id="an_755"></span> That he was deed er it were by the morwe;  
<span id="an_756"></span> And thus algates housbondes han sorwe.  
<span id="an_757"></span> Thanne tolde he me how oon Latumyus  
<span id="an_758"></span> Compleyned unto his felawe Arrius  
<span id="an_759"></span> That in his gardyn growed swich a tree  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> On which he
seyde how that his wyves thre  
<span id="an_761"></span> Hanged hemself for herte despitus.  
<span id="an_762"></span> \`O leeve brother,' quod this Arrius,  
<span id="an_763"></span> \`Yif me a plante of thilke blissed tree,  
<span id="an_764"></span> And in my gardyn planted shal it bee.'  
<span id="an_765"></span> Of latter date, of wyves hath he red  
<span id="an_766"></span> That somme han slayn hir housbondes in hir
bed,  
<span id="an_767"></span> And lete hir lecchour dighte hire al the

<span id="an_768"></span> Whan that the corps lay in the floor
upright.  
<span id="an_769"></span> And somme han dryve nayles in hir brayn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> Whil that
they slepte, and thus they had hem slayn.  
<span id="an_771"></span> Somme han hem yeve poysoun in hire drynke.  
<span id="an_772"></span> He spak moore harm than herte may bithynke,  
<span id="an_773"></span> And therwithal he knew of mo proverbes  
<span id="an_774"></span> Than in this world ther growen gras or

<span id="an_775"></span> \`Bet is,' quod he, \`thyn habitacioun

<span id="an_792"></span> I with my fest so took hym on the cheke  
<span id="an_793"></span> That in oure fyr he fil bakward adoun.  
<span id="an_794"></span> And he up stirte as dooth a wood leoun,  
<span id="an_795"></span> And with his fest he smoot me on the heed  
<span id="an_796"></span> That in the floor I lay as I were deed.  
<span id="an_797"></span> And whan he saugh how stille that I lay,  
<span id="an_798"></span> He was agast and wolde han fled his way,  
<span id="an_799"></span> Til atte laste out of my swogh I breyde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800">800</span></span> \`O! hastow
slayn me, false theef?' I seyde,  
<span id="an_801"></span> \`And for my land thus hastow mordred me?  
<span id="an_802"></span> Er I be deed, yet wol I kisse thee.'  
<span id="an_803"></span> And neer he cam, and kneled faire adoun,  
<span id="an_804"></span> And seyde, \`Deere suster Alisoun,  
<span id="an_805"></span> As help me God, I shal thee nevere smyte!  
<span id="an_806"></span> That I have doon, it is thyself to wyte.  
<span id="an_807"></span> Foryeve it me, and that I thee biseke!'  
<span id="an_808"></span> And yet eftsoones I hitte hym on the cheke,  
<span id="an_809"></span> And seyde, \`Theef, thus muchel am I wreke;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> Now wol I
dye, I may no lenger speke.'  
<span id="an_811"></span> But atte laste, with muchel care and wo,  
<span id="an_812"></span> We fille acorded by us selven two.  
<span id="an_813"></span> He yaf me al the bridel in myn hond,  
<span id="an_814"></span> To han the governance of hous and lond,  
<span id="an_815"></span> And of his tonge, and of his hond also;  
<span id="an_816"></span> And made hym brenne his book anon right tho.  
<span id="an_817"></span> And whan that I hadde geten unto me,  
<span id="an_818"></span> By maistrie, al the soveraynetee,  
<span id="an_819"></span> And that he seyde, \`Myn owene trewe wyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820">820</span></span> Do as thee
lust the terme of al thy lyf;  
<span id="an_821"></span> Keep thyn honour, and keep eek myn estaat'
--  
<span id="an_822"></span> After that day we hadden never debaat.  
<span id="an_823"></span> God helpe me so, I was to hym as kynde  
<span id="an_824"></span> As any wyf from Denmark unto Ynde,  
<span id="an_825"></span> And also trewe, and so was he to me.  
<span id="an_826"></span> I prey to God, that sit in magestee,  
<span id="an_827"></span> So blesse his soule for his mercy deere.  
<span id="an_828"></span> Now wol I seye my tale, if ye wol heere."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_830">830</span></span> "Now dame,"
quod he, "so have I joye or blis,  
<span id="an_831"></span> This is a long preamble of a tale!"  
<span id="an_832"></span> And whan the Somonour herde the Frere gale,
