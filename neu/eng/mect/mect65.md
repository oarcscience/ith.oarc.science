#### The Legend of Good Women

### The Legends

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> After the
deth of Tholome the kyng,  
<span id="an_581"></span> That al Egipt hadde in his governyng,  
<span id="an_582"></span> Regned his queene Cleopataras;  
<span id="an_583"></span> Tyl on a tyme befel there swich a cas  
<span id="an_584"></span> That out of Rome was sent a senatour  
<span id="an_585"></span> For to conqueren regnes and honour  
<span id="an_586"></span> Unto the toun of Rome, as was usaunce,  
<span id="an_587"></span> To han the world at hire obesaunce,  
<span id="an_588"></span> And soth to seyne, Antonius was his name.  
<span id="an_589"></span> So fil it, as Fortune hym oughte a shame,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> Whan he was
fallen in prosperite  
<span id="an_591"></span> Rebel unto the toun of Rome is he.  
<span id="an_592"></span> And over al this, the suster of Cesar,  
<span id="an_593"></span> He lafte hire falsly, or that she was war,  
<span id="an_594"></span> And wolde algates han another wyf,  
<span id="an_595"></span> For which he tok with Rome and Cesar stryf.  
<span id="an_596"></span> Natheles, for sothe, this ilke senatour  
<span id="an_597"></span> Was a ful worthy gentil werreyour,  
<span id="an_598"></span> And of his deth it was ful gret damage.  
<span id="an_599"></span> But love hadde brought this man in swich a
rage  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> And hym so
narwe bounden in his las,  
<span id="an_601"></span> Al for the love of Cleopataras,  
<span id="an_602"></span> That al the world he sette at no value.  
<span id="an_603"></span> Hym thoughte there nas nothyng to hym so due  
<span id="an_604"></span> As Cleopatras for to love and serve;  
<span id="an_605"></span> Hym roughte nat in armes for to sterve  
<span id="an_606"></span> In the defence of hyre and of hire ryght.  
<span id="an_607"></span> This noble queene ek lovede so this knyght,  
<span id="an_608"></span> Thourgh his desert, and for his chyvalrye;  
<span id="an_609"></span> As certeynly, but if that bokes lye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> He was, of
persone and of gentillesse,  
<span id="an_611"></span> And of discrecioun and hardynesse,  
<span id="an_612"></span> Worthi to any wyght that liven may;  
<span id="an_613"></span> And she was fayr as is the rose in May.  
<span id="an_614"></span> And, for to make shortly is the beste,  
<span id="an_615"></span> She wax his wif, and hadde hym as hire
leste.  
<span id="an_616"></span> The weddynge and the feste to devyse,  
<span id="an_617"></span> To me, that have ytake swich empryse  
<span id="an_618"></span> Of so many a story for to make,  
<span id="an_619"></span> It were to longe, lest that I shulde slake  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> Of thyng that
bereth more effect and charge;  
<span id="an_621"></span> For men may overlade a ship or barge.  
<span id="an_622"></span> And forthy to th' effect thanne wol I
skyppe,  
<span id="an_623"></span> And al the remenaunt, I wol lete it slippe.  
<span id="an_624"></span> Octovyan, that wod was of this dede,  
<span id="an_625"></span> Shop hym an ost on Antony to lede  
<span id="an_626"></span> Al uterly for his destruccioun,  
<span id="an_627"></span> With stoute Romeyns, crewel as lyoun;  
<span id="an_628"></span> To ship they wente, and thus I lat hem
sayle.  
<span id="an_629"></span> Antonius was war, and wol nat fayle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> To meten with
these Romeyns, if he may;  
<span id="an_631"></span> Tok ek his red, and bothe, upon a day,  
<span id="an_632"></span> His wif and he, and al his ost, forth wente  
<span id="an_633"></span> To shipe anon, no lengere they ne stente;  
<span id="an_634"></span> And in the se it happede hem to mete.  
<span id="an_635"></span> Up goth the trompe, and for to shoute and
shete,  
<span id="an_636"></span> And peynen hem to sette on with the sunne.  
<span id="an_637"></span> With grysely soun out goth the grete gonne,  
<span id="an_638"></span> And heterly they hurtelen al atones,  
<span id="an_639"></span> And from the top doun come the grete stones.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> In goth the
grapenel, so ful of crokes;  
<span id="an_641"></span> Among the ropes renne the sherynge-hokes.  
<span id="an_642"></span> In with the polax preseth he and he;  
<span id="an_643"></span> Byhynde the mast begynnyth he to fle,  
<span id="an_644"></span> And out ageyn, and dryveth hym overbord;  
<span id="an_645"></span> He styngeth hym upon his speres ord;  
<span id="an_646"></span> He rent the seyl with hokes lyke a sithe;  
<span id="an_647"></span> He bryngeth the cuppe and biddeth hem be
blythe;  
<span id="an_648"></span> He poureth pesen upon the haches slidere;  
<span id="an_649"></span> With pottes ful of lyme they gon togidere;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> And thus the
longe day in fyght they spende,  
<span id="an_651"></span> Tyl at the laste, as every thyng hath ende,  
<span id="an_652"></span> Antony is schent and put hym to the flyghte,  
<span id="an_653"></span> And al his folk to-go that best go myghte.  
<span id="an_654"></span> Fleth ek the queen, with al hire purpre
sayl,  
<span id="an_655"></span> For strokes, whiche that wente as thikke as
hayl;  
<span id="an_656"></span> No wonder was she myghte it nat endure.  
<span id="an_657"></span> And whan that Antony saw that aventure,  
<span id="an_658"></span> "Allas," quod he, "the day that I was born!  
<span id="an_659"></span> My worshipe in this day thus have I lorn."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> And for
dispeyr out of his wit he sterte  
<span id="an_661"></span> And rof hymself anon thourghout the herte  
<span id="an_662"></span> Or that he ferther wente out of the place.  
<span id="an_663"></span> His wif, that coude of Cesar have no grace,  
<span id="an_664"></span> To Egipt is fled for drede and for
destresse.  
<span id="an_665"></span> But herkeneth, ye that speken of kyndenesse,  
<span id="an_666"></span> Ye men that falsly sweren many an oth  
<span id="an_667"></span> That ye wol deye if that youre love be
wroth,  
<span id="an_668"></span> Here may ye sen of wemen which a trouthe!  
<span id="an_669"></span> This woful Cleopatre hath mad swich routhe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> That ther is
tonge non that may it telle.  
<span id="an_671"></span> But on the morwe she wolde no lengere
dwelle,  
<span id="an_672"></span> But made hire subtyl werkmen make a shryne  
<span id="an_673"></span> Of alle the rubyes and the stones fyne  
<span id="an_674"></span> In al Egypte that she coude espie,  
<span id="an_675"></span> And putte ful the shryne of spicerye,  
<span id="an_676"></span> And let the cors enbaume, and forth she
fette  
<span id="an_677"></span> This dede cors, and in the shryne it shette.  
<span id="an_678"></span> And next the shryne a pit thanne doth she
grave,  
<span id="an_679"></span> And alle the serpentes that she myghte have,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> She putte hem
in that grave, and thus she seyde:  
<span id="an_681"></span> "Now, love, to whom my sorweful herte obeyde  
<span id="an_682"></span> So ferforthly that from that blisful houre  
<span id="an_683"></span> That I yow swor to ben al frely youre --  
<span id="an_684"></span> I mene yow, Antonius, my knyght --  
<span id="an_685"></span> That nevere wakynge, in the day or nyght,  
<span id="an_686"></span> Ye nere out of myn hertes remembraunce,  
<span id="an_687"></span> For wel or wo, for carole or for daunce;  
<span id="an_688"></span> And in myself this covenaunt made I tho,  
<span id="an_689"></span> That ryght swich as ye felten, wel or wo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> As fer forth
as it in my power lay,  
<span id="an_691"></span> Unreprovable unto my wyfhod ay,  
<span id="an_692"></span> The same wolde I fele, lyf or deth --  
<span id="an_693"></span> And thilke covenant whil me lasteth breth  
<span id="an_694"></span> I wol fulfille; and that shal ben wel sene,  
<span id="an_695"></span> Was nevere unto hire love a trewer quene."  
<span id="an_696"></span> And with that word, naked, with ful good
herte,  
<span id="an_697"></span> Among the serpents in the pit she sterte,  
<span id="an_698"></span> And there she ches to have hire buryinge.  
<span id="an_699"></span> Anon the nadderes gonne hire for to stynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> And she hire
deth receyveth with good cheere  
<span id="an_701"></span> For love of Antony that was hire so dere.  
<span id="an_702"></span> And this is storyal soth, it is no fable.  
<span id="an_703"></span> Now, or I fynde a man thus trewe and stable,  
<span id="an_704"></span> And wol for love his deth so frely take,  
<span id="an_705"></span> I preye God let oure hedes nevere ake! Amen.  
<span id="an_706"></span> At Babiloyne whylom fil it thus,  
<span id="an_707"></span> The whyche toun the queen Semyramus  
<span id="an_708"></span> Let dychen al aboute and walles make  
<span id="an_709"></span> Ful hye, of hard tiles wel ybake:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> There were
dwellyng in this noble toun  
<span id="an_711"></span> Two lordes, whiche that were of gret renoun,  
<span id="an_712"></span> And woneden so nygh, upon a grene,  
<span id="an_713"></span> That there nas but a ston-wal hem betweene,  
<span id="an_714"></span> As ofte in grete tounes is the wone.  
<span id="an_715"></span> And soth to seyne, that o man hadde a sone,  
<span id="an_716"></span> Of al that lond oon of the lustyeste.  
<span id="an_717"></span> That other hadde a doughter, the fayreste  
<span id="an_718"></span> That estward in the world was tho dwellynge.  
<span id="an_719"></span> The name of everych gan to other sprynge  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> By women that
were neighebores aboute.  
<span id="an_721"></span> For in that contre yit, withouten doute,  
<span id="an_722"></span> Maydenes been ykept, for jelosye,  
<span id="an_723"></span> Ful streyte, lest they diden som folye.  
<span id="an_724"></span> This yonge man was called Piramus,  
<span id="an_725"></span> Tysbe hight the maide, Naso seyth thus;  
<span id="an_726"></span> And thus by report was hire name yshove  
<span id="an_727"></span> That, as they wex in age, wex here love.  
<span id="an_728"></span> And certeyn, as by resoun of hire age,  
<span id="an_729"></span> There myghte have ben bytwixe hem maryage,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730">730</span></span> But that here
fadres nolde it nat assente;  
<span id="an_731"></span> And bothe in love ylyke sore they brente,  
<span id="an_732"></span> That non of alle hyre frendes myght it
lette,  
<span id="an_733"></span> But pryvyly som tyme yit they mette  
<span id="an_734"></span> By sleyghte, and spoken som of here desyr;  
<span id="an_735"></span> As wry the glede and hotter is the fyr,  
<span id="an_736"></span> Forbede a love, and it is ten so wod.  
<span id="an_737"></span> This wal, which that bitwixe hem bothe stod,  
<span id="an_738"></span> Was clove a-two, ryght from the cop adoun,  
<span id="an_739"></span> Of olde tyme of his fundacioun;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> But yit this
clyfte was so narw and lyte  
<span id="an_741"></span> It nas nat sene, deere ynogh a myte.  
<span id="an_742"></span> But what is that that love can nat espye?  
<span id="an_743"></span> Ye loveres two, if that I shal nat lye,  
<span id="an_744"></span> Ye founden first this litel narwe clifte;  
<span id="an_745"></span> And with a soun as softe as any shryfte,  
<span id="an_746"></span> They lete here wordes thourgh the clifte
pace,  
<span id="an_747"></span> And tolden, whil that they stode in the
place,  
<span id="an_748"></span> Al here compleynt of love and al here wo,  
<span id="an_749"></span> At every tyme whan they durste so.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> Upon that o
syde of the wal stod he,  
<span id="an_751"></span> And on that other side stod Thesbe,  
<span id="an_752"></span> The swote soun of other to receyve.  
<span id="an_753"></span> And thus here wardeyns wolde they deceyve,  
<span id="an_754"></span> And every day this wal they wolde threte,  
<span id="an_755"></span> And wisshe to God that it were doun ybete.  
<span id="an_756"></span> Thus wolde they seyn: "Alas, thow wikkede
wal!  
<span id="an_757"></span> Thorgh thyn envye thow us lettest al.  
<span id="an_758"></span> Why nylt thow cleve or fallen al a-two?  
<span id="an_759"></span> Or at the leste, but thou woldist so,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> Yit woldest
thow but ones lat us mete,  
<span id="an_761"></span> Or ones that we myghte kyssen swete,  
<span id="an_762"></span> Thanne were we covered of oure cares colde.  
<span id="an_763"></span> But, natheles, yit be we to thee holde,  
<span id="an_764"></span> In as muche as thow sufferest for to gon  
<span id="an_765"></span> Oure wordes thourgh thy lym and ek thy ston.  
<span id="an_766"></span> Yit oughte we with the been wel apayd."  
<span id="an_767"></span> And whan these ydele wordes weren sayd,  
<span id="an_768"></span> The colde wal they wolden kysse of ston,  
<span id="an_769"></span> And take here leve and forth they wolden
gon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> And this was
gladly in the eve-tyde,  
<span id="an_771"></span> Or wonder erly, lest men it espyde.  
<span id="an_772"></span> And longe tyme they wroughte in this manere,  
<span id="an_773"></span> Tyl on a day, whan Phebus gan to cleere --  
<span id="an_774"></span> Aurora with the stremes of hire hete  
<span id="an_775"></span> Hadde dreyed up the dew of herbes wete --  
<span id="an_776"></span> Unto this clyft, as it was wont to be,  
<span id="an_777"></span> Com Piramus, and after com Thysbe,  
<span id="an_778"></span> And plyghten trouthe fully in here fey  
<span id="an_779"></span> That ilke same nyght to stele awey,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_780">780</span></span> And to begile
here wardeyns everichon,  
<span id="an_781"></span> And forth out of the cite for to goon;  
<span id="an_782"></span> And, for the feldes ben so brode and wide,  
<span id="an_783"></span> For to mete in o place at o tyde,  
<span id="an_784"></span> They sette mark here metynge sholde be  
<span id="an_785"></span> There kyng Nynus was grave under a tre --  
<span id="an_786"></span> For olde payens that idoles heryed  
<span id="an_787"></span> Useden tho in feldes to ben beryed --  
<span id="an_788"></span> And faste by this grave was a welle.  
<span id="an_789"></span> And shortly of this tale for to telle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_790">790</span></span> This
covenaunt was affermed wonder faste;  
<span id="an_791"></span> And longe hem thoughte that the sonne laste,  
<span id="an_792"></span> That it nere gon under the se adoun.  
<span id="an_793"></span> This Tisbe hath so gret affeccioun  
<span id="an_794"></span> And so gret lykinge Piramus to se,  
<span id="an_795"></span> That whan she say hire tyme myghte be,  
<span id="an_796"></span> At nyght she stal awey ful pryvyly,  
<span id="an_797"></span> With hire face ywympled subtyly;  
<span id="an_798"></span> For alle hire frendes -- for to save hire
trouthe --  
<span id="an_799"></span> She hath forsake; allas, and that is routhe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800">800</span></span> That evere
woman wolde ben so trewe  
<span id="an_801"></span> To truste man, but she the bet hym knewe.  
<span id="an_802"></span> And to the tre she goth a ful good pas,  
<span id="an_803"></span> For love made hire so hardy in this cas,  
<span id="an_804"></span> And by the welle adoun she gan hyre dresse.  
<span id="an_805"></span> Allas! Than cometh a wilde lyonesse  
<span id="an_806"></span> Out of the wode, withoute more arest,  
<span id="an_807"></span> With blody mouth, of strangelynge of a best,  
<span id="an_808"></span> To drynken of the welle there as she sat.  
<span id="an_809"></span> And whan that Tisbe hadde espyed that,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> She rist hire
up, with a ful drery herte,  
<span id="an_811"></span> And in a cave with dredful fot she sterte,  
<span id="an_812"></span> For by the mone she say it wel withalle.  
<span id="an_813"></span> And as she ran hire wympel let she falle  
<span id="an_814"></span> And tok non hed, so sore she was awhaped,  
<span id="an_815"></span> And ek so glad that that she was escaped;  
<span id="an_816"></span> And thus she sit and darketh wonder stylle.  
<span id="an_817"></span> Whan that this lyonesse hath dronke hire
fille,  
<span id="an_818"></span> Aboute the welle gan she for to wynde,  
<span id="an_819"></span> And ryght anon the wympel gan she fynde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820">820</span></span> And with hire
blody mouth it al torente.  
<span id="an_821"></span> Whan this was don, no lengere she ne stente,  
<span id="an_822"></span> But to the wode hire weye thanne hath she
nome.  
<span id="an_823"></span> And at the laste this Piramus is come;  
<span id="an_824"></span> But al to longe, allas, at hom was he!  
<span id="an_825"></span> The mone shon, and he myghte wel yse,  
<span id="an_826"></span> And in his wey, as that he com ful faste.  
<span id="an_827"></span> His eyen to the ground adoun he caste,  
<span id="an_828"></span> And in the sond, as he byheld adoun,  
<span id="an_829"></span> He sey the steppes brode of a lyoun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_830">830</span></span> And in his

<span id="an_831"></span> And pale he wex; therwith his heer aros,  
<span id="an_832"></span> And ner he com, and fond the wimpel torn.  
<span id="an_833"></span> "Allas," quod he, "the day that I was born!

<span id="an_841"></span> Here in this place a furlong wey or ye!  
<span id="an_842"></span> Now what lyoun that be in this forest,  
<span id="an_843"></span> My body mote he renten, or what best  
<span id="an_844"></span> That wilde is, gnawe mote he now myn herte!"  
<span id="an_845"></span> And with that word he to the wympel sterte,  
<span id="an_846"></span> And kiste it ofte, and wep on it ful sore,  
<span id="an_847"></span> And seyde, "Wympel, allas! There is no more  
<span id="an_848"></span> But thow shalt feele as wel the blod of me  
<span id="an_849"></span> As thow hast felt the bledyng of Thisbe!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_850">850</span></span> And with that
word he smot hym to the herte.  
<span id="an_851"></span> The blod out of the wounde as brode sterte  
<span id="an_852"></span> As water whan the condit broken is.  
<span id="an_853"></span> Now Tisbe, which that wiste nat of this,  
<span id="an_854"></span> But sittynge in hire drede, she thoughte
thus:  
<span id="an_855"></span> "If it so falle that my Piramus  
<span id="an_856"></span> Be comen hider, and may me not yfynde,  
<span id="an_857"></span> He may me holde fals and ek unkynde."  
<span id="an_858"></span> And out she cometh and after hym gan espien,  
<span id="an_859"></span> Bothe with hire herte and with hire yen,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860">860</span></span> And thoughte,
"I wol hym tellen of my drede,  
<span id="an_861"></span> Bothe of the lyonesse and al my deede."  
<span id="an_862"></span> And at the laste hire love thanne hath she
founde,  
<span id="an_863"></span> Betynge with his heles on the grounde,  
<span id="an_864"></span> Al blody, and therwithal a-bak she sterte,  
<span id="an_865"></span> And lik the wawes quappe gan hire herte,  
<span id="an_866"></span> And pale as box she was, and in a throwe  
<span id="an_867"></span> Avisede hire, and gan hym wel to knowe,  
<span id="an_868"></span> That it was Piramus, hire herte deere.  
<span id="an_869"></span> Who coude wryte which a dedly cheere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870">870</span></span> Hath Thisbe
now, and how hire heer she rente,  
<span id="an_871"></span> And how she gan hireselve to turmente,  
<span id="an_872"></span> And how she lyth and swouneth on the
grounde,  
<span id="an_873"></span> And how she wep of teres ful his wounde;  
<span id="an_874"></span> How medeleth she his blod with hire
compleynte;  
<span id="an_875"></span> How with his blod hireselve gan she peynte;  
<span id="an_876"></span> How clyppeth she the deede cors, allas!  
<span id="an_877"></span> How doth this woful Tisbe in this cas!  
<span id="an_878"></span> How kysseth she his frosty mouth so cold!  
<span id="an_879"></span> "Who hath don this, and who hath been so
bold  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> To sle my

<span id="an_881"></span> I am thy Tisbe, that the calleth thus."  
<span id="an_882"></span> And therwithal she lifteth up his hed.  
<span id="an_883"></span> This woful man, that was nat fully ded,  
<span id="an_884"></span> Whan that he herde the name of Tisbe cryen,  
<span id="an_885"></span> On hire he caste his hevy, dedly yen,  
<span id="an_886"></span> And doun agayn, and yeldeth up the gost.  
<span id="an_887"></span> Tysbe ryst up withouten noyse or bost,  
<span id="an_888"></span> And saw hire wympel and his empty shethe,  
<span id="an_889"></span> And ek his swerd that hym hath don to dethe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_890">890</span></span> Thanne spak
she thus: "My woful hand," quod she,  
<span id="an_891"></span> "Is strong ynogh in swich a werk to me;  
<span id="an_892"></span> For love shal yeve me strengthe and
hardynesse  
<span id="an_893"></span> To make my wounde large ynogh, I gesse.  
<span id="an_894"></span> I wol thee folwe ded, and I wol be  
<span id="an_895"></span> Felawe and cause ek of thy deth," quod she.  
<span id="an_896"></span> "And thogh that nothing, save the deth only,  
<span id="an_897"></span> Mighte thee fro me departe trewely,  
<span id="an_898"></span> Thow shalt no more departe now fro me  
<span id="an_899"></span> Than fro the deth, for I wol go with thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900">900</span></span> And now, ye
wrechede jelos fadres oure,  
<span id="an_901"></span> We that whilom were children youre,  
<span id="an_902"></span> We preyen yow, withouten more envye,  
<span id="an_903"></span> That in o grave yfere we moten lye,  
<span id="an_904"></span> Sith love hath brought us to this pitous
ende.  
<span id="an_905"></span> And ryghtwis God to every lovere sende,  
<span id="an_906"></span> That loveth trewely, more prosperite  
<span id="an_907"></span> Than evere yit had Piramus and Tisbe!  
<span id="an_908"></span> And lat no gentil woman hyre assure  
<span id="an_909"></span> To putten hire in swich an aventure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_910">910</span></span> But God
forbede but a woman can  
<span id="an_911"></span> Ben as trewe in lovynge as a man!  
<span id="an_912"></span> And for my part, I shal anon it kythe."  
<span id="an_913"></span> And with that word his swerd she tok as
swythe,  
<span id="an_914"></span> That warm was of hire loves blod, and hot,  
<span id="an_915"></span> And to the herte she hireselven smot.  
<span id="an_916"></span> And thus are Tisbe and Piramus ygo.  
<span id="an_917"></span> Of trewe men I fynde but fewe mo  
<span id="an_918"></span> In alle my bokes, save this Piramus,  
<span id="an_919"></span> And therfore have I spoken of hym thus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920">920</span></span> For it is
deynte to us men to fynde  
<span id="an_921"></span> A man that can in love been trewe and kynde.  
<span id="an_922"></span> Here may ye se, what lovere so he be,  
<span id="an_923"></span> A woman dar and can as wel as he.  
<span id="an_924"></span> Glorye and honour, Virgil Mantoan,

<span id="an_926"></span> Folwe thy lanterne, as thow gost byforn,  
<span id="an_927"></span> How Eneas to Dido was forsworn.  
<span id="an_928"></span> In thyn Eneyde and Naso wol I take  
<span id="an_929"></span> The tenor, and the grete effectes make.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> Whan Troye
brought was to destruccioun  
<span id="an_931"></span> By Grekes sleyghte, and namely by Synoun,  
<span id="an_932"></span> Feynynge the hors offered unto Mynerve,  
<span id="an_933"></span> Thourgh which that many a Troyan moste
sterve;  
<span id="an_934"></span> And Ector hadde, after his deth, apeered;  
<span id="an_935"></span> And fyr so wod it myghte nat been steered  
<span id="an_936"></span> In al the noble tour of Ylioun,  
<span id="an_937"></span> That of the cite was the chef dongeoun;  
<span id="an_938"></span> And al the contre was so lowe ybrought,  
<span id="an_939"></span> And Priamus the kyng fordon and nought;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> And Enyas was
charged by Venus  
<span id="an_941"></span> To fleen awey, he tok Ascanius,  
<span id="an_942"></span> That was his sone, in his ryght hand and
fledde;  
<span id="an_943"></span> And on his bak he bar and with hym ledde  
<span id="an_944"></span> His olde fader cleped Anchises,  
<span id="an_945"></span> And by the weye his wif Creusa he les.  
<span id="an_946"></span> And moche sorwe hadde he in his mynde,  
<span id="an_947"></span> Or that he coude his felaweshipe fynde.  
<span id="an_948"></span> But at the laste, whan he hadde hem founde,  
<span id="an_949"></span> He made hym redy in a certeyn stounde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> And to the se
ful faste he gan him hye,  
<span id="an_951"></span> And sayleth forth with al his companye  
<span id="an_952"></span> Toward Ytayle, as wolde his destinee.  
<span id="an_953"></span> But of his aventures in the se  
<span id="an_954"></span> Nis nat to purpos for to speke of here,  
<span id="an_955"></span> For it acordeth nat to my matere.  
<span id="an_956"></span> But, as I seyde, of hym and of Dido  
<span id="an_957"></span> Shal be my tale, til that I have do.  
<span id="an_958"></span> So longe he saylede in the salte se  
<span id="an_959"></span> Tyl in Libie unnethe aryvede he  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_960">960</span></span> With shipes
sevene and with no more navye;  
<span id="an_961"></span> And glad was he to londe for to hye,  
<span id="an_962"></span> So was he with the tempest al toshake.  
<span id="an_963"></span> And whan that he the haven hadde ytake,  
<span id="an_964"></span> He hadde a knyght, was called Achates,  
<span id="an_965"></span> And hym of al his felawshipe he ches  
<span id="an_966"></span> To gon with hym, the cuntre for t' espie.  
<span id="an_967"></span> He tok with hym no more companye,  
<span id="an_968"></span> But forth they gon, and lafte his shipes
ryde,  
<span id="an_969"></span> His fere and he, withouten any gyde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> So longe he
walketh in this wildernesse,  
<span id="an_971"></span> Til at the laste he mette an hunteresse.  
<span id="an_972"></span> A bowe in hande and arwes hadde she;  
<span id="an_973"></span> Hire clothes cutted were unto the kne.  
<span id="an_974"></span> But she was yit the fayreste creature  
<span id="an_975"></span> That evere was yformed by Nature;  
<span id="an_976"></span> And Eneas and Achates she grette,  
<span id="an_977"></span> And thus she to hem spak whan she hem mette:  
<span id="an_978"></span> "Saw ye," quod she, "as ye han walked wyde,  
<span id="an_979"></span> Any of my sustren walke yow besyde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980">980</span></span> With any

<span id="an_983"></span> "Nay, sothly, lady," quod this Eneas;  
<span id="an_984"></span> "But by thy beaute, as it thynketh me,  
<span id="an_985"></span> Thow myghtest nevere erthly woman be,  
<span id="an_986"></span> But Phebus syster art thow, as I gesse.  
<span id="an_987"></span> And if so be that thow be a goddesse,  
<span id="an_988"></span> Have mercy on oure labour and oure wo."  
<span id="an_989"></span> "I n' am no goddesse, sothly," quod she tho;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990">990</span></span> "For maydens

<span id="an_992"></span> This is the reyne of Libie there ye ben,  
<span id="an_993"></span> Of which that Dido lady is and queen" --  
<span id="an_994"></span> And shortly tolde hym al the occasyoun  
<span id="an_995"></span> Why Dido cam into that regioun,

<span id="an_997"></span> It nedeth nat, it were but los of tyme.  
<span id="an_998"></span> For this is al and som, it was Venus,  
<span id="an_999"></span> His owene moder, that spak with him thus,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> And to
Cartage she bad he sholde hym dighte,  
<span id="an_1001"></span> And vanyshed anon out of his syghte.  
<span id="an_1002"></span> I coude folwe, word for word, Virgile,  
<span id="an_1003"></span> But it wolde lasten al to longe while.  
<span id="an_1004"></span> This noble queen that cleped was Dido,  
<span id="an_1005"></span> That whilom was the wif of Sytheo,  
<span id="an_1006"></span> That fayrer was than is the bryghte sonne,  
<span id="an_1007"></span> This noble toun of Cartage hath bigonne;  
<span id="an_1008"></span> In which she regneth in so gret honour  
<span id="an_1009"></span> That she was holden of alle queenes flour  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> Of

<span id="an_1014"></span> She stod so wel in every wightes grace.  
<span id="an_1015"></span> Whan Eneas was come unto that place,  
<span id="an_1016"></span> Unto the mayster temple of al the toun

<span id="an_1018"></span> Ful pryvyly his weye than hath he nome.  
<span id="an_1019"></span> Whan he was in the large temple come,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020">1020</span></span> I can nat
seyn if that it be possible,  
<span id="an_1021"></span> But Venus hadde hym maked invysible --  
<span id="an_1022"></span> Thus seyth the bok, withouten any les.  
<span id="an_1023"></span> And whan this Eneas and Achates  
<span id="an_1024"></span> Hadden in this temple ben overal,  
<span id="an_1025"></span> Thanne founde they, depeynted on a wal,  
<span id="an_1026"></span> How Troye and al the lond destroyed was.  
<span id="an_1027"></span> "Allas, that I was born!" quod Eneas;

<span id="an_1047"></span> For al the companye of Eneas,

<span id="an_1065"></span> Shal ben disherited in swich degre;  
<span id="an_1066"></span> And saw the man, that he was lyk a knyght,  
<span id="an_1067"></span> And suffisaunt of persone and of myght,  
<span id="an_1068"></span> And lyk to been a verray gentil man;  
<span id="an_1069"></span> And wel his wordes he besette can,

<span id="an_1071"></span> And formed wel of braunes and of bones.  
<span id="an_1072"></span> For after Venus hadde he swich fayrnesse

<span id="an_1103"></span> This Eneas is come to paradys

<span id="an_1105"></span> Remembreth hym of his estat in Troye.  
<span id="an_1106"></span> To daunsynge chaumberes ful of paramentes,  
<span id="an_1107"></span> Of riche beddes, and of ornementes,  
<span id="an_1108"></span> This Eneas is led after the mete.  
<span id="an_1109"></span> And with the quene, whan that he hadde
sete,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1110">1110</span></span> And spices
parted, and the wyn agon,  
<span id="an_1111"></span> Unto his chambres was he led anon  
<span id="an_1112"></span> To take his ese and for to have his reste,  
<span id="an_1113"></span> With al his folk, to don what so hem leste.  
<span id="an_1114"></span> There nas courser wel ybrydeled non,  
<span id="an_1115"></span> Ne stede, for the justing wel to gon,  
<span id="an_1116"></span> Ne large palfrey, esy for the nones,  
<span id="an_1117"></span> Ne jewel, fretted ful of ryche stones,  
<span id="an_1118"></span> Ne sakkes ful of gold, of large wyghte,  
<span id="an_1119"></span> Ne ruby non, that shynede by nyghte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120">1120</span></span> Ne gentil
hawtein faucoun heroner,  
<span id="an_1121"></span> Ne hound for hert or wilde bor or der,  
<span id="an_1122"></span> Ne coupe of gold, with floreyns newe ybete,  
<span id="an_1123"></span> That in the land of Libie may be gete,  
<span id="an_1124"></span> That Dido ne hath it Eneas ysent;  
<span id="an_1125"></span> And al is payed, what that he hath spent.  
<span id="an_1126"></span> Thus can this quene honurable hire gestes
calle,  
<span id="an_1127"></span> As she that can in fredom passen alle.  
<span id="an_1128"></span> Eneas sothly ek, withouten les,  
<span id="an_1129"></span> Hadde sent unto his ship by Achates  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1130">1130</span></span> After his
sone, and after riche thynges,  
<span id="an_1131"></span> Bothe sceptre, clothes, broches, and ek
rynges,  
<span id="an_1132"></span> Some for to were, and some for to presente  
<span id="an_1133"></span> To hire that alle thise noble thynges hym
sente;  
<span id="an_1134"></span> And bad his sone how that he shulde make  
<span id="an_1135"></span> The presenting, and to the queen it take.  
<span id="an_1136"></span> Repeyred is this Achates agayn,  
<span id="an_1137"></span> And Eneas ful blysful is and fayn  
<span id="an_1138"></span> To sen his yonge sone Ascanyus.  
<span id="an_1139"></span> But natheles, oure autour telleth us,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140">1140</span></span> That
Cupido, that is the god of love,  
<span id="an_1141"></span> At preyere of his moder hye above,  
<span id="an_1142"></span> Hadde the liknesse of the child ytake,  
<span id="an_1143"></span> This noble queen enamored to make  
<span id="an_1144"></span> On Eneas; but, as of that scripture,  
<span id="an_1145"></span> Be as be may, I take of it no cure.  
<span id="an_1146"></span> But soth is this, the queen hath mad swich
chere  
<span id="an_1147"></span> Unto this child, that wonder is to here;  
<span id="an_1148"></span> And of the present that his fader sente  
<span id="an_1149"></span> She thanked hym ful ofte, in good entente.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1150">1150</span></span> Thus is
this queen in plesaunce and in joye,  
<span id="an_1151"></span> With alle these newe lusty folk of Troye.  
<span id="an_1152"></span> And of the dedes hath she more enquered  
<span id="an_1153"></span> Of Eneas, and al the story lered  
<span id="an_1154"></span> Of Troye, and al the longe day they tweye  
<span id="an_1155"></span> Entendeden to speken and to pleye;  
<span id="an_1156"></span> Of which ther gan to breden swich a fyr  
<span id="an_1157"></span> That sely Dido hath now swich desyr  
<span id="an_1158"></span> With Eneas, hire newe gest, to dele,  
<span id="an_1159"></span> That she hath lost hire hewe and ek hire
hele.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> Now to th'
effect, now to the fruyt of al,  
<span id="an_1161"></span> Whi I have told this story, and telle shal.  
<span id="an_1162"></span> Thus I begynne: it fil upon a nyght,  
<span id="an_1163"></span> Whan that the mone up reysed hadde his
lyght,  
<span id="an_1164"></span> This noble queene unto hire reste wente.  
<span id="an_1165"></span> She siketh sore, and gan hyreself turmente;  
<span id="an_1166"></span> She waketh, walweth, maketh many a breyd,  
<span id="an_1167"></span> As don these lovers, as I have herd seyd.  
<span id="an_1168"></span> And at the laste, unto hire syster Anne  
<span id="an_1169"></span> She made hire mone, and ryght thus spak she
thanne:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1170">1170</span></span> "Now, dere
sister myn, what may it be  
<span id="an_1171"></span> That me agasteth in my drem?" quod she.  
<span id="an_1172"></span> "This newe Troyan is so in my thought,  
<span id="an_1173"></span> For that me thynketh he is so wel ywrought,  
<span id="an_1174"></span> And ek so likly for to ben a man,  
<span id="an_1175"></span> And therwithal so moche good he can,  
<span id="an_1176"></span> That al my love and lyf lyth in his cure.  
<span id="an_1177"></span> Have ye nat herd him telle his aventure?  
<span id="an_1178"></span> Now certes, Anne, if that ye rede it me,  
<span id="an_1179"></span> I wolde fayn to hym ywedded be;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1180">1180</span></span> This is th'
effect; what sholde I more seye?  
<span id="an_1181"></span> In hym lyth al, to do me live or deye."  
<span id="an_1182"></span> Hyre syster Anne, as she that coude hire
good,  
<span id="an_1183"></span> Seyde as hire thoughte, and somdel it
withstod.  
<span id="an_1184"></span> But herof was so long a sermounynge  
<span id="an_1185"></span> It were to long to make rehersynge.  
<span id="an_1186"></span> But finaly, it may nat ben withstonde;  
<span id="an_1187"></span> Love wol love, for nothing wol it wonde.  
<span id="an_1188"></span> The dawenyng up-rist out of the se.  
<span id="an_1189"></span> This amorous queene chargeth hire meyne  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190">1190</span></span> The nettes
dresse, and speres brode and kene;  
<span id="an_1191"></span> An huntyng wol this lusty freshe queene,  
<span id="an_1192"></span> So priketh hire this newe joly wo.  
<span id="an_1193"></span> To hors is al hir lusty folk ygo;  
<span id="an_1194"></span> Into the court the houndes been ybrought;  
<span id="an_1195"></span> And upon coursers swift as any thought  
<span id="an_1196"></span> Hire yonge knyghtes hoven al aboute,  
<span id="an_1197"></span> And of hire women ek an huge route.  
<span id="an_1198"></span> Upon a thikke palfrey, paper-whit,  
<span id="an_1199"></span> With sadel red, enbrouded with delyt,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> Of gold the
barres up enbosede hye,  
<span id="an_1201"></span> Sit Dido, al in gold and perre wrye;  
<span id="an_1202"></span> And she as fair as is the bryghte morwe,  
<span id="an_1203"></span> That heleth syke folk of nyghtes sorwe.  
<span id="an_1204"></span> Upon a courser stertlynge as the fyr --  
<span id="an_1205"></span> Men myghte turne hym with a litel wyr --  
<span id="an_1206"></span> Sit Eneas, lik Phebus to devyse,  
<span id="an_1207"></span> So was he fressh arayed in his wyse.  
<span id="an_1208"></span> The fomy brydel with the bit of gold  
<span id="an_1209"></span> Governeth he ryght as hymself hath wold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> And forth
this noble queen thus lat I ride  
<span id="an_1211"></span> On huntynge, with this Troyan by hyre side.  
<span id="an_1212"></span> The herde of hertes founden is anon,  
<span id="an_1213"></span> With "Hay! Go bet! Pryke thow! Lat gon, lat
gon!  
<span id="an_1214"></span> Why nyl the leoun comen, or the bere,  
<span id="an_1215"></span> That I myghte ones mete hym with this
spere?"  
<span id="an_1216"></span> Thus seyn these yonge folk, and up they
kylle  
<span id="an_1217"></span> These bestes wilde, and han hem at here
wille.  
<span id="an_1218"></span> Among al this to rumbelen gan the hevene;  
<span id="an_1219"></span> The thunder rored with a grisely stevene;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1220">1220</span></span> Doun cam
the reyn with hayl and slet so faste,  
<span id="an_1221"></span> With hevenes fyr, that it so sore agaste  
<span id="an_1222"></span> This noble queen, and also hire meyne,  
<span id="an_1223"></span> That ech of hem was glad awey to fle.  
<span id="an_1224"></span> And shortly, from the tempest hire to save,  
<span id="an_1225"></span> She fledde hireself into a litel cave,  
<span id="an_1226"></span> And with hire wente this Eneas also.  
<span id="an_1227"></span> I not, with hem if there wente any mo;  
<span id="an_1228"></span> The autour maketh of it no mencioun.  
<span id="an_1229"></span> And here began the depe affeccioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1230">1230</span></span> Betwixe hem
two; this was the firste morwe  
<span id="an_1231"></span> Of hire gladnesse, and gynning of hire
sorwe.  
<span id="an_1232"></span> For there hath Eneas ykneled so,  
<span id="an_1233"></span> And told hire al his herte and al his wo,  
<span id="an_1234"></span> And swore so depe to hire to be trewe  
<span id="an_1235"></span> For wel or wo and chaunge hire for no newe;  
<span id="an_1236"></span> And as a fals lovere so wel can pleyne,  
<span id="an_1237"></span> That sely Dido rewede on his peyne,  
<span id="an_1238"></span> And tok hym for husbonde and becom his wyf  
<span id="an_1239"></span> For everemo, whil that hem laste lyf.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1240">1240</span></span> And after
this, whan that the tempest stente,  
<span id="an_1241"></span> With myrthe out as they comen, hom they
wente.  
<span id="an_1242"></span> The wikke fame upros, and that anon,  
<span id="an_1243"></span> How Eneas hath with the queen ygon  
<span id="an_1244"></span> Into the cave; and demede as hem liste.  
<span id="an_1245"></span> And whan the kyng that Yarbas highte it
wiste,  
<span id="an_1246"></span> As he that hadde hir loved evere his lyf,  
<span id="an_1247"></span> And wowede hyre, to han hire to his wyf,  
<span id="an_1248"></span> Swich sorwe as he hath maked, and swich
cheere,  
<span id="an_1249"></span> It is a routhe and pite for to here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1250">1250</span></span> But as in
love, alday it happeth so  
<span id="an_1251"></span> That oon shal laughen at anothers wo.  
<span id="an_1252"></span> Now laugheth Eneas and is in joye  
<span id="an_1253"></span> And more richesse than evere he was in
Troye.  
<span id="an_1254"></span> O sely wemen, ful of innocence,  
<span id="an_1255"></span> Ful of pite, of trouthe and conscience,  
<span id="an_1256"></span> What maketh yow to men to truste so?  
<span id="an_1257"></span> Have ye swych routhe upon hyre feyned wo,  
<span id="an_1258"></span> And han swich olde ensaumples yow beforn?  
<span id="an_1259"></span> Se ye nat alle how they ben forsworn?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1260">1260</span></span> Where sen

<span id="an_1261"></span> Or ben unkynde, or don hire som myscheef,  
<span id="an_1262"></span> Or piled hire, or bosted of his dede?  
<span id="an_1263"></span> Ye may as wel it sen as ye may rede.  
<span id="an_1264"></span> Tak hede now of this grete gentil-man,  
<span id="an_1265"></span> This Troyan, that so wel hire plesen can,  
<span id="an_1266"></span> That feyneth hym so trewe and obeysynge,  
<span id="an_1267"></span> So gentil, and so privy of his doinge,  
<span id="an_1268"></span> And can so wel don alle his obeysaunces,  
<span id="an_1269"></span> And wayten hire at festes and at daunces,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1270">1270</span></span> And whan

<span id="an_1271"></span> And fasten til he hath his lady seyn,  
<span id="an_1272"></span> And beren in his devyses, for hire sake,  
<span id="an_1273"></span> Not I not what; and songes wolde he make,  
<span id="an_1274"></span> Justen, and don of armes many thynges,  
<span id="an_1275"></span> Sende hire lettres, tokens, broches, rynges
--  
<span id="an_1276"></span> Now herkneth how he shal his lady serve!  
<span id="an_1277"></span> There as he was in peril for to sterve  
<span id="an_1278"></span> For hunger, and for myschef in the se,  
<span id="an_1279"></span> And desolat, and fled from his cuntre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1280">1280</span></span> And al his

<span id="an_1281"></span> She hath hire body and ek hire reame yiven  
<span id="an_1282"></span> Into his hand, there as she myghte have
been  
<span id="an_1283"></span> Of othere land than of Cartage a queen,  
<span id="an_1284"></span> And lyved in joye ynogh; what wole ye more?  
<span id="an_1285"></span> This Eneas, that hath so depe yswore,  
<span id="an_1286"></span> Is wery of his craft withinne a throwe;  
<span id="an_1287"></span> The hote ernest is al overblowe.  
<span id="an_1288"></span> And pryvyly he doth his shipes dyghte,  
<span id="an_1289"></span> And shapeth hym to stele awey by nyghte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1290">1290</span></span> This Dido
hath suspecioun of this,  
<span id="an_1291"></span> And thoughte wel that it was al amys.  
<span id="an_1292"></span> For in hir bed he lyth a-nyght and syketh.  
<span id="an_1293"></span> She axeth hym anon what hym myslyketh --  
<span id="an_1294"></span> "My dere herte, which that I love most?"  
<span id="an_1295"></span> "Certes," quod he, "this nyght my faderes
gost  
<span id="an_1296"></span> Hath in my slep so sore me tormented,  
<span id="an_1297"></span> And ek Mercurye his message hath presented,  
<span id="an_1298"></span> That nedes to the conquest of Ytayle  
<span id="an_1299"></span> My destine is sone for to sayle;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300">1300</span></span> For which,
me thynketh, brosten is myn herte!"  
<span id="an_1301"></span> Therwith his false teres out they sterte,  
<span id="an_1302"></span> And taketh hire withinne his armes two.  
<span id="an_1303"></span> "Is that in ernest?" quod she; "Wole ye so?

<span id="an_1305"></span> Allas, what woman wole ye of me make?  
<span id="an_1306"></span> I am a gentil woman and a queen.  
<span id="an_1307"></span> Ye wole nat from youre wif thus foule

<span id="an_1308"></span> That I was born, allas! What shal I do?"  
<span id="an_1309"></span> To telle in short, this noble quen Dydo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1310">1310</span></span> She seketh
halwes and doth sacryfise;  
<span id="an_1311"></span> She kneleth, cryeth, that routhe is to
devyse;  
<span id="an_1312"></span> Conjureth hym, and profereth hym to be  
<span id="an_1313"></span> His thral, his servant in the leste degre;  
<span id="an_1314"></span> She falleth hym to fote and swouneth ther,  
<span id="an_1315"></span> Dischevele, with hire bryghte gilte her,  
<span id="an_1316"></span> And seyth, "Have mercy; let me with yow
ryde!  
<span id="an_1317"></span> These lordes, which that wonen me besyde,  
<span id="an_1318"></span> Wole me distroyen only for youre sake.  
<span id="an_1319"></span> And, so ye wole me now to wive take,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1320">1320</span></span> As ye han

<span id="an_1322"></span> For thanne yit shal I deyen as youre wif.  
<span id="an_1323"></span> I am with childe, and yeve my child his

<span id="an_1324"></span> Mercy, lord! Have pite in youre thought!"  
<span id="an_1325"></span> But al this thing avayleth hire ryght
nought,  
<span id="an_1326"></span> For on a nyght, slepynge he let hire lye,  
<span id="an_1327"></span> And stal awey unto his companye,  
<span id="an_1328"></span> And as a traytour forth he gan to sayle  
<span id="an_1329"></span> Toward the large contre of Ytayle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1330">1330</span></span> Thus he
hath laft Dido in wo and pyne,  
<span id="an_1331"></span> And wedded ther a lady hyghte Lavyne.  
<span id="an_1332"></span> A cloth he lafte, and ek his swerd
stondynge,  
<span id="an_1333"></span> Whan he from Dido stal in hire slepynge,  
<span id="an_1334"></span> Ryght at hire beddes hed, so gan he hie,  
<span id="an_1335"></span> Whan that he stal awey to his navye;  
<span id="an_1336"></span> Which cloth, whan sely Dido gan awake,  
<span id="an_1337"></span> She hath it kyst ful ofte for his sake,  
<span id="an_1338"></span> And seyde, "O swete cloth, whil Juppiter it

<span id="an_1339"></span> Tak now my soule, unbynd me of this

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1340">1340</span></span> I have

<span id="an_1341"></span> And thus, allas, withouten his socours,  
<span id="an_1342"></span> Twenty tyme yswouned hath she thanne.  
<span id="an_1343"></span> And whanne that she unto hire syster Anne  
<span id="an_1344"></span> Compleyned hadde -- of which I may nat
wryte,  
<span id="an_1345"></span> So gret a routhe I have it for t' endite --  
<span id="an_1346"></span> And bad hire norice and hire sister gon  
<span id="an_1347"></span> To fechen fyr and other thyng anon,  
<span id="an_1348"></span> And seyde that she wolde sacryfye --  
<span id="an_1349"></span> And whan she myghte hire tyme wel espie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> Upon the

<span id="an_1351"></span> And with his swerd she rof hyre to the

<span id="an_1352"></span> But, as myn auctour seith, yit thus she
seyde;  
<span id="an_1353"></span> Or she was hurt, byforen or she deyde,  
<span id="an_1354"></span> She wrot a lettre anon that thus began:  
<span id="an_1355"></span> "Ryght so," quod she, "as that the white

<span id="an_1363"></span> Al be it that I shal ben nevere the better;  
<span id="an_1364"></span> For thilke wynd that blew youre ship awey,  
<span id="an_1365"></span> The same wynd hath blowe awey youre fey."  
<span id="an_1366"></span> But who wol al this letter have in mynde,  
<span id="an_1367"></span> Rede Ovyde, and in hym he shal it fynde.  
<span id="an_1368"></span> Thow rote of false lovers, Duc Jasoun,  
<span id="an_1369"></span> Thow sly devourere and confusioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1370">1370</span></span> Of gentil
wemen, tendre creatures,  
<span id="an_1371"></span> Thow madest thy recleymyng and thy lures  
<span id="an_1372"></span> To ladyes of thy statly aparaunce,  
<span id="an_1373"></span> And of thy wordes farced with plesaunce,  
<span id="an_1374"></span> And of thy feyned trouthe and thy manere,  
<span id="an_1375"></span> With thyn obesaunce and humble cheere,  
<span id="an_1376"></span> And with thy contrefeted peyne and wo.  
<span id="an_1377"></span> There othere falsen oon, thow falsest two!  
<span id="an_1378"></span> O, often swore thow that thow woldest dye  
<span id="an_1379"></span> For love, whan thow ne feltest maladye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1380">1380</span></span> Save foul
delyt, which that thow callest love!  
<span id="an_1381"></span> Yif that I live, thy name shal be shove  
<span id="an_1382"></span> In English that thy sekte shal be knowe!  
<span id="an_1383"></span> Have at thee, Jason! Now thyn horn is
blowe!  
<span id="an_1384"></span> But certes, it is bothe routhe and wo  
<span id="an_1385"></span> That love with false loveres werketh so;  
<span id="an_1386"></span> For they shal have wel betere love and
chere  
<span id="an_1387"></span> Than he that hath abought his love ful
dere,  
<span id="an_1388"></span> Or hadde in armes many a blody box.  
<span id="an_1389"></span> For evere as tendre a capoun et the fox,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1390">1390</span></span> Thow he be
fals and hath the foul betrayed,  
<span id="an_1391"></span> As shal the good-man that therfore hath
payed.  
<span id="an_1392"></span> Al have he to the capoun skille and ryght,  
<span id="an_1393"></span> The false fox wol have his part at nyght.  
<span id="an_1394"></span> On Jason this ensaumple is wel ysene  
<span id="an_1395"></span> By Isiphile and Medea the queene.  
<span id="an_1396"></span> In Tessalie, as Guido tellith us,  
<span id="an_1397"></span> There was a kyng that highte Pelleus,  
<span id="an_1398"></span> That hadde a brother which that highte
Eson;  
<span id="an_1399"></span> And whan for age he myghte unnethes gon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400">1400</span></span> He yaf to
Pelleus the governyng  
<span id="an_1401"></span> Of al his regne and made hym lord and kyng.  
<span id="an_1402"></span> Of which Eson this Jason geten was,  
<span id="an_1403"></span> That in his tyme in al that land there nas  
<span id="an_1404"></span> Nat swich a famous knyght of gentilesse,  
<span id="an_1405"></span> Of fredom, and of strengthe and lustynesse.  
<span id="an_1406"></span> After his fadres deth he bar hym so  
<span id="an_1407"></span> That there nas non that liste ben his fo,  
<span id="an_1408"></span> But dide hym al honour and companye.  
<span id="an_1409"></span> Of which this Pelleus hadde gret envye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1410">1410</span></span> Imagynynge
that Jason myghte be  
<span id="an_1411"></span> Enhaunsed so and put in swich degre  
<span id="an_1412"></span> With love of lordes of his regioun,  
<span id="an_1413"></span> That from his regne he may ben put adoun.  
<span id="an_1414"></span> And in his wit a-nyght compassed he  
<span id="an_1415"></span> How Jason myghte best distroyed be  
<span id="an_1416"></span> Withoute sclaunder of his compassement,  
<span id="an_1417"></span> And at the last he tok avysement  
<span id="an_1418"></span> To senden hym into som fer contre,  
<span id="an_1419"></span> There as this Jason may destroyed be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1420">1420</span></span> This was
his wit, al made he to Jasoun  
<span id="an_1421"></span> Gret chere of love and of affeccioun,  
<span id="an_1422"></span> For drede lest his lordes it espide.  
<span id="an_1423"></span> So fyl it, so as fame renneth wide,  
<span id="an_1424"></span> There was swich tydyng overal and swich
loos,  
<span id="an_1425"></span> That in an yle that called was Colcos,  
<span id="an_1426"></span> Beyonde Troye, estward in the se,  
<span id="an_1427"></span> That therin was a ram that men mighte se  
<span id="an_1428"></span> That hadde a fles of gold that shon so
bryghte  
<span id="an_1429"></span> That nowher was ther swich anothir syghte;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1430">1430</span></span> But it was
kept alwey with a dragoun,  
<span id="an_1431"></span> And many other merveyles, up and doun,  
<span id="an_1432"></span> And with two boles maked al of bras,  
<span id="an_1433"></span> That spitten fyr, and moche thyng there
was.  
<span id="an_1434"></span> But this was ek the tale, natheles,  
<span id="an_1435"></span> That whoso wolde wynne thylke fles,  
<span id="an_1436"></span> He moste bothe, or he it wynne myghte,  
<span id="an_1437"></span> With the boles and the dragoun fyghte.  
<span id="an_1438"></span> And kyng Oetes lord was of that yle.  
<span id="an_1439"></span> This Pelleus bethoughte upon this wile,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440">1440</span></span> That he his
neveu Jason wolde enhorte  
<span id="an_1441"></span> To saylen to that lond, hym to disporte,  
<span id="an_1442"></span> And seyde, "Nevew, if it myghte be  
<span id="an_1443"></span> That swich a worshipe myghte fallen the,  
<span id="an_1444"></span> That thow this famous tresor myghtest
wynne,  
<span id="an_1445"></span> And bryngen it my regioun withinne,  
<span id="an_1446"></span> It were to me gret plesaunce and honour.  
<span id="an_1447"></span> Thanne were I holde to quyte thy labour;  
<span id="an_1448"></span> And al the cost I wol myselven make.  
<span id="an_1449"></span> And chees what folk that thow wilt with the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450">1450</span></span> Lat sen
now, darst thow take this viage?"  
<span id="an_1451"></span> Jason was yong, and lusty of corage,  
<span id="an_1452"></span> And undertok to don this ilke empryse.  
<span id="an_1453"></span> Anon Argus his shipes gan devyse;  
<span id="an_1454"></span> With Jason wente the stronge Ercules,  
<span id="an_1455"></span> And many another that he with hym ches.  
<span id="an_1456"></span> But whoso axeth who is with hym gon,  
<span id="an_1457"></span> Lat hym go rede Argonautycon,  
<span id="an_1458"></span> For he wole telle a tale long ynogh.  
<span id="an_1459"></span> Philotetes anon the sayl up drogh,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1460">1460</span></span> Whan that

<span id="an_1461"></span> Out of his contre called Thessalye.  
<span id="an_1462"></span> So longe he seyled in the salte se,  
<span id="an_1463"></span> Til in the yle of Lemnon aryvede he --  
<span id="an_1464"></span> Al be this nat rehersed of Guido,  
<span id="an_1465"></span> Yit seyth Ovyde in his Epistels so --  
<span id="an_1466"></span> And of this ile lady was and quene

<span id="an_1481"></span> That in a cog to londe were ygo,  
<span id="an_1482"></span> Hem to refreshen and to take the eyr.  
<span id="an_1483"></span> The morwenynge attempre was and fayr,  
<span id="an_1484"></span> And in his weye this messanger hem mette.  
<span id="an_1485"></span> Ful cunnyngly these lordes two he grette,  
<span id="an_1486"></span> And dide his message, axinge hem anon  
<span id="an_1487"></span> If they were broken, or ought wo begon,  
<span id="an_1488"></span> Or hadden nede of lodman or vitayle;  
<span id="an_1489"></span> For of socour they sholde nothyng fayle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1490">1490</span></span> For it was
outrely the quenes wille.  
<span id="an_1491"></span> Jason answerde mekely and stylle:  
<span id="an_1492"></span> "My lady," quod he, "thanke I hertely  
<span id="an_1493"></span> Of hire goodnesse; us nedeth, trewely,

<span id="an_1497"></span> This lady rometh by the clyf to pleye,  
<span id="an_1498"></span> With hire meyne, endelong the stronde,  
<span id="an_1499"></span> And fynt this Jason and this other stonde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500">1500</span></span> In spekynge
of this thyng, as I yow tolde.  
<span id="an_1501"></span> This Ercules and Jason gan beholde  
<span id="an_1502"></span> How that the queen it was, and fayre hire
grette  
<span id="an_1503"></span> Anon-ryght as they with this lady mette;  
<span id="an_1504"></span> And she tok hed, and knew by hyre manere,  
<span id="an_1505"></span> By hire aray, by wordes, and by chere,  
<span id="an_1506"></span> That it were gentil-men of gret degre,  
<span id="an_1507"></span> And to the castel with hire ledeth she  
<span id="an_1508"></span> These straunge folk and doth hem gret
honour,  
<span id="an_1509"></span> And axeth hem of travayle and labour  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1510">1510</span></span> That they
han suffered in the salte se;  
<span id="an_1511"></span> So that, withinne a day, or two, or thre,  
<span id="an_1512"></span> She knew, by folk that in his shipes be,  
<span id="an_1513"></span> That it was Jason, ful of renone,  
<span id="an_1514"></span> And Ercules, that hadde the grete los,  
<span id="an_1515"></span> That soughten the aventures of Colcos;  
<span id="an_1516"></span> And dide hem honour more than before,  
<span id="an_1517"></span> And with hem deled evere lenger the more,  
<span id="an_1518"></span> For they ben worthy folk, withouten les.  
<span id="an_1519"></span> And namely, most she spak with Ercules;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1520">1520</span></span> To hym hire
herte bar, he shulde be  
<span id="an_1521"></span> Sad, wys, and trewe, of wordes avyse,  
<span id="an_1522"></span> Withouten any other affeccioun  
<span id="an_1523"></span> Of love, or evyl ymagynacyoun.  
<span id="an_1524"></span> This Ercules hath so this Jason preysed  
<span id="an_1525"></span> That to the sonne he hath hym up areysed,  
<span id="an_1526"></span> That half so trewe a man there nas of love  
<span id="an_1527"></span> Under the cope of heven that is above;  
<span id="an_1528"></span> And he was wis, hardy, secre, and ryche.  
<span id="an_1529"></span> Of these thre poyntes there nas non hym
liche:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1530">1530</span></span> Of fredom
passede he, and lustyhede,  
<span id="an_1531"></span> Alle tho that lyven or been dede;  
<span id="an_1532"></span> Therto so gret a gentilman was he,  
<span id="an_1533"></span> And of Thessalye likly kyng to be.  
<span id="an_1534"></span> There nas no lak, but that he was agast  
<span id="an_1535"></span> To love, and for to speke shamefast.  
<span id="an_1536"></span> He hadde lever hymself to morder, and dye,  
<span id="an_1537"></span> Than that men shulde a lovere hym espye.  
<span id="an_1538"></span> "As wolde God that I hadde yive  
<span id="an_1539"></span> My blod and flesh, so that I myghte live,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1540">1540</span></span> With the
nones that he hadde owher a wif  
<span id="an_1541"></span> For hys estat; for swich a lusty lyf  
<span id="an_1542"></span> She shulde lede with this lusty knyght!"  
<span id="an_1543"></span> And al this was compassed on the nyght  
<span id="an_1544"></span> Bytwixe hym Jason and this Ercules.  
<span id="an_1545"></span> Of these two here was a shrewed lees,  
<span id="an_1546"></span> To come to hous upon an innocent!  
<span id="an_1547"></span> For to bedote this queen was here assent.  
<span id="an_1548"></span> And Jason is as coy as is a mayde;  
<span id="an_1549"></span> He loketh pitously, but nought he sayde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1550">1550</span></span> But frely
yaf he to hire conseyleres  
<span id="an_1551"></span> Yiftes grete, and to hire officeres.  
<span id="an_1552"></span> As wolde God I leyser hadde and tyme  
<span id="an_1553"></span> By proces al his wowyng for to ryme!  
<span id="an_1554"></span> But in this hous if any fals lovere be,  
<span id="an_1555"></span> Ryght as hymself now doth, ryght so dide
he,  
<span id="an_1556"></span> With feynynge, and with every subtil dede.  
<span id="an_1557"></span> Ye gete namore of me, but ye wole rede  
<span id="an_1558"></span> Th' origynal, that telleth al the cas.  
<span id="an_1559"></span> The somme is this: that Jason wedded was  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1560">1560</span></span> Unto this
queen and tok of hir substaunce  
<span id="an_1561"></span> What so hym leste unto his purveyaunce;  
<span id="an_1562"></span> And upon hire begat he children two,  
<span id="an_1563"></span> And drogh his sayl and saw hir nevere mo.  
<span id="an_1564"></span> A letter sente she to hym, certeyn,  
<span id="an_1565"></span> Which were to longe to wryten and to sen,  
<span id="an_1566"></span> And hym reprevith of his grete untrouthe,  
<span id="an_1567"></span> And preyeth him on hire to have som routhe.  
<span id="an_1568"></span> And of his children two she seyde hym this:  
<span id="an_1569"></span> That they ben lyk of alle thyng, ywis,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1570">1570</span></span> To Jason,
save they coude nat begile;  
<span id="an_1571"></span> And preyede God, or it were longe while,  
<span id="an_1572"></span> That she that hadde his herte yraft hire
fro  
<span id="an_1573"></span> Moste fynden hym untrewe to hir also,  
<span id="an_1574"></span> And that she moste bothe hire chyldren
spylle,  
<span id="an_1575"></span> And alle tho that sufferede hym his wille.  
<span id="an_1576"></span> And trewe to Jason was she al hire lyf,  
<span id="an_1577"></span> And evere kepte hire chast, as for his wif;  
<span id="an_1578"></span> Ne nevere hadde she joye at hire herte,  
<span id="an_1579"></span> But deyede for his love, of sorwes smerte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> To Colcos
comen is this duc Jasoun,  
<span id="an_1581"></span> That is of love devourer and dragoun.  
<span id="an_1582"></span> As mater apetiteth forme alwey  
<span id="an_1583"></span> And from forme into forme it passen may,  
<span id="an_1584"></span> Or as a welle that were botomles,  
<span id="an_1585"></span> Ryght so can false Jason have no pes.  
<span id="an_1586"></span> For to desyren thourgh his apetit  
<span id="an_1587"></span> To don with gentil women his delyt,  
<span id="an_1588"></span> This is his lust and his felicite.  
<span id="an_1589"></span> Jason is romed forth to the cyte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1590">1590</span></span> That whilom
cleped was Jaconitos,  
<span id="an_1591"></span> That was the mayster-toun of al Colcos,  
<span id="an_1592"></span> And hath ytold the cause of his comyng  
<span id="an_1593"></span> Unto Oetes, of that contre kyng,  
<span id="an_1594"></span> Preyinge hym that he moste don his assay  
<span id="an_1595"></span> To gete the fles of gold if that he may;  
<span id="an_1596"></span> Of which the kyng assenteth to his bone,  
<span id="an_1597"></span> And doth hym honour, as it was to done,  
<span id="an_1598"></span> So fer forth that his doughter and his eyr,  
<span id="an_1599"></span> Medea, which that was so wis and fayr  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600">1600</span></span> That fayrer

<span id="an_1601"></span> He made hire don to Jason companye  
<span id="an_1602"></span> At mete, and sitte by hym in the halle.  
<span id="an_1603"></span> Now was Jason a semely man withalle,  
<span id="an_1604"></span> And lyk a lord, and hadde a gret renoun,  
<span id="an_1605"></span> And of his lok as real as a leoun,  
<span id="an_1606"></span> And goodly of his speche, and familer,  
<span id="an_1607"></span> And coude of love al craft and art pleyner  
<span id="an_1608"></span> Withoute bok, with everych observaunce.  
<span id="an_1609"></span> And, as Fortune hire oughte a foul
myschaunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1610">1610</span></span> She wex
enamoured upon this man.  
<span id="an_1611"></span> "Jason," quod she, "for ought I se or can,  
<span id="an_1612"></span> As of this thyng the whiche ye ben aboute,  
<span id="an_1613"></span> Ye han youreself yput in moche doute.  
<span id="an_1614"></span> For whoso wol this aventure acheve,  
<span id="an_1615"></span> He may nat wel asterten, as I leve,  
<span id="an_1616"></span> Withouten deth, but I his helpe be.  
<span id="an_1617"></span> But natheles, it is my wylle," quod she,  
<span id="an_1618"></span> "To fortheren yow so that ye shal nat die,  
<span id="an_1619"></span> But turnen sound hom to youre Tessalye."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> "My ryghte

<span id="an_1625"></span> God thanke yow there I ne can ne may!  
<span id="an_1626"></span> Youre man I am, and lowely yow beseche  
<span id="an_1627"></span> To ben my helpe, withoute more speche;  
<span id="an_1628"></span> But, certes, for my deth shal I nat spare."  
<span id="an_1629"></span> Tho gan this Medea to hym declare  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1630">1630</span></span> The peril
of this cas from poynt to poynt,  
<span id="an_1631"></span> And of his batayle, and in what disjoynt  
<span id="an_1632"></span> He mote stonde, of which no creature  
<span id="an_1633"></span> Save only she ne myghte his lyf assure.  
<span id="an_1634"></span> And shortly to the poynt ryght for to go,  
<span id="an_1635"></span> They been acorded ful bytwixe hem two  
<span id="an_1636"></span> That Jason shal hire wedde, as trewe
knyght;  
<span id="an_1637"></span> And terme set to come sone at nyght  
<span id="an_1638"></span> Unto hire chamber and make there his oth  
<span id="an_1639"></span> Upon the goddes, that he for lef or loth  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1640">1640</span></span> Ne sholde
nevere hire false, nyght ne day,  
<span id="an_1641"></span> To ben hire husbonde whil he lyve may,  
<span id="an_1642"></span> As she that from his deth hym saved here.  
<span id="an_1643"></span> And hereupon at nyght they mette in-feere,  
<span id="an_1644"></span> And doth his oth, and goth with hire to
bedde;  
<span id="an_1645"></span> And on the morwe upward he hym spedde,  
<span id="an_1646"></span> For she hath taught hym how he shal nat
fayle  
<span id="an_1647"></span> The fles to wynne and stynten his batayle;  
<span id="an_1648"></span> And saved hym his lyf and his honour;  
<span id="an_1649"></span> And gat hym a name ryght as a conquerour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1650">1650</span></span> Ryght
thourgh the sleyghte of hire enchauntement.  
<span id="an_1651"></span> Now hath Jason the fles, and hom is went  
<span id="an_1652"></span> With Medea, and tresor ful gret won;  
<span id="an_1653"></span> But unwist of hire fader is she gon  
<span id="an_1654"></span> To Tessaly with Duk Jason hire lef,  
<span id="an_1655"></span> That afterward hath brought hire to
myschef.  
<span id="an_1656"></span> For as a traytour he is from hire go,  
<span id="an_1657"></span> And with hire lafte his yonge children two,  
<span id="an_1658"></span> And falsly hath betraysed hire, allas,  
<span id="an_1659"></span> As evere in love a chef traytour he was;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1660">1660</span></span> And wedded
yit the thridde wif anon,  
<span id="an_1661"></span> That was the doughter of the kyng Creon.  
<span id="an_1662"></span> This is the mede of lovynge and guerdoun  
<span id="an_1663"></span> That Medea receyved of Jasoun  
<span id="an_1664"></span> Ryght for hire trouthe and for hire
kyndenesse,  
<span id="an_1665"></span> That lovede hym beter than hireself, I
gesse,  
<span id="an_1666"></span> And lafte hire fader and hire herytage.  
<span id="an_1667"></span> And of Jason this is the vassellage,  
<span id="an_1668"></span> That in his dayes nas ther non yfounde  
<span id="an_1669"></span> So fals a lovere goinge on the grounde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1670">1670</span></span> And
therfore in hire letter thus she seyde  
<span id="an_1671"></span> Fyrst, whan she of his falsnesse hym
upbreyde:  
<span id="an_1672"></span> "Whi lykede me thy yelwe her to se  
<span id="an_1673"></span> More than the boundes of myn honeste?  
<span id="an_1674"></span> Why lykede me thy youthe and thy fayrnesse,  
<span id="an_1675"></span> And of thy tonge, the infynyt
graciousnesse?  
<span id="an_1676"></span> O, haddest thow in thy conquest ded ybe,  
<span id="an_1677"></span> Ful mikel untrouthe hadde ther deyd with

<span id="an_1678"></span> Wel can Ovyde hire letter in vers endyte,  
<span id="an_1679"></span> Which were as now to long for me to wryte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1680">1680</span></span> Now mot I
seyn the exilynge of kynges  
<span id="an_1681"></span> Of Rome, for here horible doinges,  
<span id="an_1682"></span> And of the laste kyng Tarquinius,  
<span id="an_1683"></span> As seyth Ovyde and Titus Lyvius.  
<span id="an_1684"></span> But for that cause telle I nat this storye,  
<span id="an_1685"></span> But for to preyse and drawe to memorye  
<span id="an_1686"></span> The verray wif, the verray trewe Lucresse,  
<span id="an_1687"></span> That for hyre wifhod and hire
stedefastnesse  
<span id="an_1688"></span> Nat only that these payens hire comende,  
<span id="an_1689"></span> But he that cleped is in oure legende  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1690">1690</span></span> The grete
Austyn hath gret compassioun  
<span id="an_1691"></span> Of this Lucresse, that starf at Rome toun;  
<span id="an_1692"></span> And in what wise, I wol but shortly trete,  
<span id="an_1693"></span> And of this thyng I touche but the grete.  
<span id="an_1694"></span> Whan Ardea beseged was aboute  
<span id="an_1695"></span> With Romeyns, that ful sterne were and
stoute,  
<span id="an_1696"></span> Ful longe lay the sege and lytel wroughten,  
<span id="an_1697"></span> So that they were half idel, as hem
thoughten;  
<span id="an_1698"></span> And in his pley Tarquinius the yonge  
<span id="an_1699"></span> Gan for to jape, for he was lyght of tonge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700">1700</span></span> And seyde
that it was an ydel lyf;  
<span id="an_1701"></span> No man dide there no more than his wif.  
<span id="an_1702"></span> "And lat us speke of wyves, that is best;  
<span id="an_1703"></span> Preyse every man his owene as hym lest,  
<span id="an_1704"></span> And with oure speche lat us ese oure
herte."  
<span id="an_1705"></span> A knyght that highte Colatyn up sterte,  
<span id="an_1706"></span> And seyde thus: "Nay, sire, it is no nede  
<span id="an_1707"></span> To trowen on the word, but on the dede.  
<span id="an_1708"></span> I have a wif," quod he, "that, as I trowe,  
<span id="an_1709"></span> Is holden good of alle that evere hire

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1710">1710</span></span> Go we
to-nyght to Rome, and we shal se."  
<span id="an_1711"></span> Tarquinius answerde, "That liketh me."  
<span id="an_1712"></span> To Rome be they come, and faste hem dyghte  
<span id="an_1713"></span> To Colatynes hous and doun they lyghte,  
<span id="an_1714"></span> Tarquinius and ek this Colatyn.  
<span id="an_1715"></span> The husbonde knew the estris wel and fyn,  
<span id="an_1716"></span> And prively into the hous they gon,  
<span id="an_1717"></span> Nor at the yate porter nas there non,  
<span id="an_1718"></span> And at the chambre-dore they abyde.  
<span id="an_1719"></span> This noble wif sat by hire beddes side  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1720">1720</span></span> Dischevele,
for no malyce she ne thoughte;  
<span id="an_1721"></span> And softe wolle oure bok seyth that she
wroughte  
<span id="an_1722"></span> To kepen hire from slouthe and idelnesse;  
<span id="an_1723"></span> And bad hire servaunts don hire besynesse,  
<span id="an_1724"></span> And axeth hem, "What tydyngs heren ye?  
<span id="an_1725"></span> How seyth men of the sege, how shal it be?  
<span id="an_1726"></span> God wolde the walles were falle adoun!  
<span id="an_1727"></span> Myn husbonde is to longe out of this toun,  
<span id="an_1728"></span> For which the drede doth me so to smerte  
<span id="an_1729"></span> That with a swerd it stingeth to myn herte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1730">1730</span></span> Whan I

<span id="an_1731"></span> God save my lord, I preye hym for his

<span id="an_1732"></span> And therwithal ful tenderly she wep,  
<span id="an_1733"></span> And of hire werk she tok no more kep,  
<span id="an_1734"></span> And mekely she let hyre eyen falle;  
<span id="an_1735"></span> And thilke semblaunt sat hire wel withalle.  
<span id="an_1736"></span> And eek hire teres, ful of honeste,  
<span id="an_1737"></span> Embelished hire wifly chastite;  
<span id="an_1738"></span> Hyre contenaunce is to hire herte dygne,  
<span id="an_1739"></span> For they acorde bothe in dede and sygne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1740">1740</span></span> And with
that word hire husbonde Colatyn,  
<span id="an_1741"></span> Or she of him was war, com stertynge in  
<span id="an_1742"></span> And seyde, "Drede the nat, for I am here!"  
<span id="an_1743"></span> And she anon up ros with blysful chere  
<span id="an_1744"></span> And kiste hym, as of wives is the wone.  
<span id="an_1745"></span> Tarquinius, this proude kynges sone,  
<span id="an_1746"></span> Conceyved hath hire beaute and hyre cheere,  
<span id="an_1747"></span> Hire yelwe her, hire shap, and hire manere,  
<span id="an_1748"></span> Hire hew, hire wordes, that she hath

<span id="an_1749"></span> (And by no craft hire beaute nas nat
feyned),  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1750">1750</span></span> And caughte
to this lady swich desyr  
<span id="an_1751"></span> That in his herte brende as any fyr,  
<span id="an_1752"></span> So wodly that his wit was al forgeten.  
<span id="an_1753"></span> For wel thoghte he she wolde nat ben geten;  
<span id="an_1754"></span> And ay the more that he was in dispayr,  
<span id="an_1755"></span> The more he coveyteth and thoughte hire

<span id="an_1756"></span> His blynde lust was al his coveytynge.  
<span id="an_1757"></span> A-morwe, whan the brid began to synge,  
<span id="an_1758"></span> Unto the sege he cometh ful privily,  
<span id="an_1759"></span> And by hymself he walketh soberly,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1760">1760</span></span> Th' ymage
of hire recordynge alwey newe:  
<span id="an_1761"></span> "Thus lay hire her, and thus fresh was hyre
hewe;  
<span id="an_1762"></span> Thus sat, thus spak, thus span; this was hire
chere;  
<span id="an_1763"></span> Thus fayr she was, and this was hire
manere."  
<span id="an_1764"></span> Al this conseit hys herte hath newe ytake.  
<span id="an_1765"></span> And as the se, with tempest al toshake,  
<span id="an_1766"></span> That after, whan the storm is al ago,  
<span id="an_1767"></span> Yit wol the water quappe a day or two,  
<span id="an_1768"></span> Ryght so, thogh that hire forme were
absent,  
<span id="an_1769"></span> The plesaunce of hire forme was present;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1770">1770</span></span> But
natheles, nat plesaunce but delit,  
<span id="an_1771"></span> Or an unrightful talent, with dispit --  
<span id="an_1772"></span> "For, maugre hyre, she shal my leman be!  
<span id="an_1773"></span> Hap helpeth hardy man alday," quod he;  
<span id="an_1774"></span> "What ende that I make, it shal be so."  
<span id="an_1775"></span> And girte hym with his swerd and gan to go,  
<span id="an_1776"></span> And forth he rit til he to Rome is come,  
<span id="an_1777"></span> And al alone his wey than hath he nome  
<span id="an_1778"></span> Unto the hous of Colatyn ful ryght.  
<span id="an_1779"></span> Doun was the sonne and day hath lost his
lyght;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1780">1780</span></span> And in he
cometh into a prive halke,  
<span id="an_1781"></span> And in the nyght ful thefly gan he stalke,  
<span id="an_1782"></span> Whan every wight was to his reste brought,  
<span id="an_1783"></span> Ne no wight hadde of tresoun swich a
thought.  
<span id="an_1784"></span> Were it by wyndow or by other gyn,  
<span id="an_1785"></span> With swerd ydrawe shortly he com in  
<span id="an_1786"></span> There as she lay, this noble wif Lucresse.  
<span id="an_1787"></span> And as she wok, hire bed she felte presse.  
<span id="an_1788"></span> "What beste is that," quod she, "that weyeth
thus?"  
<span id="an_1789"></span> "I am the kynges sone, Tarquinius,"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1790">1790</span></span> Quod he,
"but, and thow crye or noyse make,  
<span id="an_1791"></span> Or if there any creature awake,

<span id="an_1793"></span> This swerd thourghout thyn herte shal I

<span id="an_1794"></span> And therwithal unto hire throte he sterte,  
<span id="an_1795"></span> And sette the poynt al sharp upon hire
herte.  
<span id="an_1796"></span> No word she spak, she hath no myght therto.  
<span id="an_1797"></span> What shal she seyn? Hire wit is al ago.  
<span id="an_1798"></span> Ryght as a wolf that fynt a lomb alone,  
<span id="an_1799"></span> To whom shal she compleyne or make mone?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800">1800</span></span> What, shal
she fyghte with an hardy knyght?  
<span id="an_1801"></span> Wel wot men that a woman hath no myght.  
<span id="an_1802"></span> What, shal she crye, or how shal she

<span id="an_1803"></span> That hath hire by the throte with swerd at

<span id="an_1804"></span> She axeth grace, and seyth al that she can.  
<span id="an_1805"></span> "Ne wilt thow nat," quod he, this crewel

<span id="an_1812"></span> These Romeyns wyves lovede so here name  
<span id="an_1813"></span> At thilke tyme, and dredde so the shame,  
<span id="an_1814"></span> That, what for fer of sclaunder and drede of

<span id="an_1815"></span> She loste bothe at ones wit and breth,  
<span id="an_1816"></span> And in a swogh she lay, and wex so ded  
<span id="an_1817"></span> Men myghte smyten of hire arm or hed;

<span id="an_1819"></span> Tarquinius, that art a kynges eyr,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1820">1820</span></span> And

<span id="an_1824"></span> Allas, of the this was a vileyns dede!  
<span id="an_1825"></span> But now to purpos; in the story I rede,  
<span id="an_1826"></span> Whan he was gon and this myschaunce is
falle,  
<span id="an_1827"></span> This lady sente after hire frendes alle,  
<span id="an_1828"></span> Fader, moder, husbonde, alle yfeere;  
<span id="an_1829"></span> And al dischevele, with hire heres cleere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1830">1830</span></span> In habit
swich as women used tho  
<span id="an_1831"></span> Unto the buryinge of hire frendes go,  
<span id="an_1832"></span> She sit in halle with a sorweful sighte.  
<span id="an_1833"></span> Hyre frendes axen what hire eylen myghte,  
<span id="an_1834"></span> And who was ded; and she sit ay wepynge;  
<span id="an_1835"></span> A word, for shame, forth ne myght she
brynge,  
<span id="an_1836"></span> Ne upon hem she durste nat beholde.  
<span id="an_1837"></span> But atte last of Tarquyny she hem tolde  
<span id="an_1838"></span> This rewful cas and al thys thing horryble.  
<span id="an_1839"></span> The woo to tellen were an impossible,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1840">1840</span></span> That she
and al hir frendes made attones.  
<span id="an_1841"></span> Al hadde folkes hertes ben of stones,  
<span id="an_1842"></span> Hyt myght have maked hem upon hir rewe,  
<span id="an_1843"></span> Hir herte was so wyfly and so trewe.  
<span id="an_1844"></span> She sayde that, for hir gylt ne for hir
blame,  
<span id="an_1845"></span> Hir husbonde shulde nat have the foule
name,  
<span id="an_1846"></span> That wolde she nat suffre by no wey.  
<span id="an_1847"></span> And they answerden alle, upon hir fey,  
<span id="an_1848"></span> That they forgave yt hyr, for yt was ryght;  
<span id="an_1849"></span> It was no gilt, it lay not in hir myght;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1850">1850</span></span> And seyden
hir ensamples many oon.  
<span id="an_1851"></span> But al for noght; for thus she seyde anoon:  
<span id="an_1852"></span> "Be as be may," quod she, "of forgyvyng,  
<span id="an_1853"></span> I wol not have noo forgyft for nothing."  
<span id="an_1854"></span> But pryvely she kaughte forth a knyf,  
<span id="an_1855"></span> And therwithal she rafte hirself hir lyf;  
<span id="an_1856"></span> And as she fel adoun, she kaste hir lok,  
<span id="an_1857"></span> And of hir clothes yet she hede tok.  
<span id="an_1858"></span> For in hir fallynge yet she had a care,  
<span id="an_1859"></span> Lest that hir fet or suche thyng lay bare;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1860">1860</span></span> So wel she
loved clennesse and eke trouthe.  
<span id="an_1861"></span> Of hir had al the toun of Rome routhe,  
<span id="an_1862"></span> And Brutus by hir chaste blood hath swore  
<span id="an_1863"></span> That Tarquyn shulde ybanysshed be therfore,  
<span id="an_1864"></span> And al hys kyn; and let the peple calle,  
<span id="an_1865"></span> And openly the tale he tolde hem alle,  
<span id="an_1866"></span> And openly let cary her on a bere  
<span id="an_1867"></span> Thurgh al the toun, that men may see and
here  
<span id="an_1868"></span> The horryble dede of hir oppressyoun,  
<span id="an_1869"></span> Ne never was ther kyng in Rome toun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1870">1870</span></span> Syn thilke
day; and she was holden there  
<span id="an_1871"></span> A seynt, and ever hir day yhalwed dere  
<span id="an_1872"></span> As in hir lawe; and thus endeth Lucresse,  
<span id="an_1873"></span> The noble wyf, as Tytus bereth witnesse.  
<span id="an_1874"></span> I telle hyt for she was of love so trewe,  
<span id="an_1875"></span> Ne in hir wille she chaunged for no newe;  
<span id="an_1876"></span> And for the stable herte, sadde and kynde,  
<span id="an_1877"></span> That in these wymmen men may alday fynde.  
<span id="an_1878"></span> Ther as they kaste hir herte, there it

<span id="an_1879"></span> For wel I wot that Crist himselve telleth  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1880">1880</span></span> That in
Israel, as wyd as is the lond,  
<span id="an_1881"></span> That so gret feyth in al that he ne fond  
<span id="an_1882"></span> As in a woman; and this is no lye.  
<span id="an_1883"></span> And as of men, loke ye which tirannye  
<span id="an_1884"></span> They doon alday; assay hem whoso lyste,  
<span id="an_1885"></span> The trewest ys ful brotel for to triste.  
<span id="an_1886"></span> Juge infernal, Mynos, of Crete kyng,  
<span id="an_1887"></span> Now cometh thy lot, now comestow on the
ryng.  
<span id="an_1888"></span> Nat for thy sake oonly write I this storye,  
<span id="an_1889"></span> But for to clepe ageyn unto memorye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1890">1890</span></span> Of Theseus
the grete untrouthe of love;  
<span id="an_1891"></span> For which the goddes of the heven above  
<span id="an_1892"></span> Ben wrothe, and wreche han take for thy
synne.  
<span id="an_1893"></span> Be red for shame! Now I thy lyf begynne.  
<span id="an_1894"></span> Mynos, that was the myghty kyng of Crete,  
<span id="an_1895"></span> That hadde an hundred citees stronge and
grete,  
<span id="an_1896"></span> To scole hath sent hys sone Androgeus,  
<span id="an_1897"></span> To Athenes; of the which hyt happed thus,  
<span id="an_1898"></span> That he was slayn, lernynge philosophie,  
<span id="an_1899"></span> Ryght in that citee, nat but for envye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900">1900</span></span> The grete
Mynos, of the which I speke,  
<span id="an_1901"></span> Hys sones deth ys come for to wreke.  
<span id="an_1902"></span> Alcathoe he besegeth harde and longe;  
<span id="an_1903"></span> But natheles, the walles be so stronge,  
<span id="an_1904"></span> And Nysus, that was kyng of that citee,  
<span id="an_1905"></span> So chevalrous, that lytel dredeth he;  
<span id="an_1906"></span> Of Mynos or hys ost tok he no cure,  
<span id="an_1907"></span> Til on a day befel an aventure,  
<span id="an_1908"></span> That Nysus doughter stod upon the wal,  
<span id="an_1909"></span> And of the sege saw the maner al.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1910">1910</span></span> So happed
it that at a scarmishyng  
<span id="an_1911"></span> She caste hire herte upon Mynos the kyng,  
<span id="an_1912"></span> For his beaute and for his chyvalrye,  
<span id="an_1913"></span> So sore that she wende for to dye.  
<span id="an_1914"></span> And, shortly of this proces for to pace,  
<span id="an_1915"></span> She made Mynos wynnen thilke place,  
<span id="an_1916"></span> So that the cite was al at his wille,  
<span id="an_1917"></span> To saven whom hym leste or elles spille.  
<span id="an_1918"></span> But wikkedly he quitte hire kyndenesse,  
<span id="an_1919"></span> And let hire drenche in sorwe and
distresse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1920">1920</span></span> Nere that
the goddes hadde of hire pite;  
<span id="an_1921"></span> But that tale were to long as now for me.  
<span id="an_1922"></span> Athenes wan thys kyng Mynos also,  
<span id="an_1923"></span> As Alcathoe, and other tounes mo.  
<span id="an_1924"></span> And this th' effect, that Mynos hath so
driven  
<span id="an_1925"></span> Hem of Athenes that they mote hym yiven  
<span id="an_1926"></span> From yer to yer hire owene children dere  
<span id="an_1927"></span> For to be slayne right as ye shal here.  
<span id="an_1928"></span> This Mynos hadde a monstre, a wiked best,  
<span id="an_1929"></span> That was so crewel that, withoute arest,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1930">1930</span></span> Whan that a
man was brought in his presence,  
<span id="an_1931"></span> He wolde hym ete; ther helpeth no defence.  
<span id="an_1932"></span> And every thridde yeer, withouten doute,  
<span id="an_1933"></span> They caste lot, and as it com aboute  
<span id="an_1934"></span> On riche, on pore, he moste his sone take,  
<span id="an_1935"></span> And of his child he moste present make  
<span id="an_1936"></span> Unto Minos, to save hym or to spylle,  
<span id="an_1937"></span> Or lete his best devoure hym at his wille.  
<span id="an_1938"></span> And this hath Mynos don, ryght in dispit;  
<span id="an_1939"></span> To wreke his sone was set al his delyt,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1940">1940</span></span> And maken
hem of Athenes his thral  
<span id="an_1941"></span> From yer to yer, whil that he liven shal;  
<span id="an_1942"></span> And hom he sayleth whan this toun is wonne.  
<span id="an_1943"></span> This wiked custom is so longe yronne,  
<span id="an_1944"></span> Til that of Athenes kyng Egeus  
<span id="an_1945"></span> Mot senden his owene sone, Theseus,  
<span id="an_1946"></span> Sith that the lot is fallen hym upon,  
<span id="an_1947"></span> To ben devoured, for grace is there non.  
<span id="an_1948"></span> And forth is lad this woful yonge knyght  
<span id="an_1949"></span> Unto the court of kyng Mynos ful ryght,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1950">1950</span></span> And into a
prysoun, fetered, cast is he  
<span id="an_1951"></span> Tyl thilke tyme he sholde freten be.  
<span id="an_1952"></span> Wel maystow wepe, O woful Theseus,  
<span id="an_1953"></span> That art a kynges sone, and dampned thus.  
<span id="an_1954"></span> Me thynketh this, that thow were depe
yholde  
<span id="an_1955"></span> To whom that savede thee from cares colde!  
<span id="an_1956"></span> And if now any woman helpe the,  
<span id="an_1957"></span> Wel oughtestow hire servaunt for to be,  
<span id="an_1958"></span> And ben hire trewe lovere yer be yere!  
<span id="an_1959"></span> But now to come ageyn to my matere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1960">1960</span></span> The tour
there as this Theseus is throwe  
<span id="an_1961"></span> Doun in the botom derk and wonder lowe,  
<span id="an_1962"></span> Was joynynge in the wal to a foreyne;  
<span id="an_1963"></span> And it was longynge to the doughtren tweyne  
<span id="an_1964"></span> Of Mynos, that in hire chaumbers grete  
<span id="an_1965"></span> Dwellten above, toward the mayster-strete  
<span id="an_1966"></span> Of Athenes, in joye and in solas.  
<span id="an_1967"></span> Noot I not how, it happede par cas,  
<span id="an_1968"></span> As Theseus compleynede hym by nyghte,  
<span id="an_1969"></span> The kynges doughter, Adryane that highte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1970">1970</span></span> And ek hire
syster Phedra, herden al  
<span id="an_1971"></span> His compleynynge as they stode on the wal  
<span id="an_1972"></span> And lokeden upon the bryghte mone.  
<span id="an_1973"></span> Hem leste nat to go to bedde so sone;  
<span id="an_1974"></span> And of his wo they hadde compassioun.  
<span id="an_1975"></span> A kynges sone to ben in swich prysoun,  
<span id="an_1976"></span> And ben devoured, thoughte hem gret pite.  
<span id="an_1977"></span> This Adryane spak to hire syster fre,  
<span id="an_1978"></span> And seyde, "Phedra, leve syster dere,  
<span id="an_1979"></span> This woful lordes sone may ye nat here,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1980">1980</span></span> How
pitously compleyneth he his kyn,  
<span id="an_1981"></span> And ek his povre estat that he is in,  
<span id="an_1982"></span> And gilteles? Now, certes, it is routhe!  
<span id="an_1983"></span> And if ye wol assenten, by my trouthe,  
<span id="an_1984"></span> He shal ben holpen, how so that we do."  
<span id="an_1985"></span> Phedra answerde, "Ywis, me is as wo  
<span id="an_1986"></span> For hym as evere I was for any man;  
<span id="an_1987"></span> And, to his help, the beste red I can  
<span id="an_1988"></span> Is that we do the gayler prively  
<span id="an_1989"></span> To come and speke with us hastily,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1990">1990</span></span> And don
this woful man with hym to come.  
<span id="an_1991"></span> For if he may this monstre overcome,  
<span id="an_1992"></span> Thanne were he quyt; ther is non other
bote.  
<span id="an_1993"></span> Lat us wel taste hym at his herte-rote,  
<span id="an_1994"></span> That if so be that he a wepen have,  
<span id="an_1995"></span> Wher that he dar, his lyf to kepe and save,  
<span id="an_1996"></span> Fyghten with the fend, and hym defende.  
<span id="an_1997"></span> For in the prysoun ther he shal descende,  
<span id="an_1998"></span> Ye wote wel that the beste is in a place  
<span id="an_1999"></span> That nys nat derk, and hath roum eek and
space  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2000">2000</span></span> To welde an
ax, or swerd, or staf, or knyf;  
<span id="an_2001"></span> So that, me thynketh, he shulde save his
lyf.  
<span id="an_2002"></span> If that he be a man, he shal do so.  
<span id="an_2003"></span> And we shul make hym balles ek also  
<span id="an_2004"></span> Of wex and tow, that whan he gapeth faste,  
<span id="an_2005"></span> Into the bestes throte he shal hem caste  
<span id="an_2006"></span> To slake his hunger and encombre his teth;  
<span id="an_2007"></span> And right anon, whan that Theseus seth  
<span id="an_2008"></span> The beste achoked, he shal on hym lepe  
<span id="an_2009"></span> To slen hym or they comen more to-hepe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010">2010</span></span> This wepen
shal the gayler, or that tyde,  
<span id="an_2011"></span> Ful prively withinne the prysoun hyde;  
<span id="an_2012"></span> And for the hous is krynkeled to and fro,  
<span id="an_2013"></span> And hath so queynte weyes for to go --  
<span id="an_2014"></span> For it is shapen as the mase is wrought --  
<span id="an_2015"></span> Therto have I a remedye in my thought,  
<span id="an_2016"></span> That, by a clewe of twyn, as he hath gon,  
<span id="an_2017"></span> The same weye he may returne anon,  
<span id="an_2018"></span> Folwynge alwey the thred as he hath come.  
<span id="an_2019"></span> And whan that he this beste hath overcome,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2020">2020</span></span> Thanne may
he flen awey out of this drede,  
<span id="an_2021"></span> And ek the gayler may he with hym lede,  
<span id="an_2022"></span> And hym avaunce at hom in his cuntre,  
<span id="an_2023"></span> Syn that so gret a lordes sone is he.  
<span id="an_2024"></span> This is my red, if that he dar it take."  
<span id="an_2025"></span> What sholde I lenger sarmoun of it make?  
<span id="an_2026"></span> This gayler cometh, and with hym Theseus.  
<span id="an_2027"></span> Whan these thynges ben acorded thus,  
<span id="an_2028"></span> Adoun sit Theseus upon his kne --  
<span id="an_2029"></span> "The ryghte lady of my lyf," quod he,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2140">2140</span></span> His wepne,
his clewe, his thyng, that I have sayd,  
<span id="an_2141"></span> Was by the gayler in the hous yleyd,  
<span id="an_2142"></span> Ther as the Mynotaur hath his dwellynge,  
<span id="an_2143"></span> Ryght faste by the dore, at his entrynge.  
<span id="an_2144"></span> And Theseus is lad unto his deth,  
<span id="an_2145"></span> And forth unto this Mynotaur he geth,  
<span id="an_2146"></span> And by the techynge of this Adryane  
<span id="an_2147"></span> He overcom this beste and was his bane;  
<span id="an_2148"></span> And out he cometh by the clewe agayn  
<span id="an_2149"></span> Ful prively, whan he this beste hath slayn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2150">2150</span></span> And by the

<span id="an_2155"></span> And to the contre of Ennopye hym dyghte  
<span id="an_2156"></span> There as he hadde a frend of his knowynge.  
<span id="an_2157"></span> There feste they, there daunce they and

<span id="an_2158"></span> And in his armes hath this Adryane,  
<span id="an_2159"></span> That of the beste hath kept hym from his

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2160">2160</span></span> And gat hym

<span id="an_2161"></span> And of his contre-folk a ful gret won,  
<span id="an_2162"></span> And taketh his leve, and homward sayleth

<span id="an_2163"></span> And in an yle amyd the wilde se,

<span id="an_2169"></span> His maryners han don ryght as hym leste;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2170">2170</span></span> And, for to

<span id="an_2178"></span> And fond his fader drenched in the se.  
<span id="an_2179"></span> Me lest no more to speke of hym, parde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2180">2180</span></span> These false

<span id="an_2181"></span> But I wol turne ageyn to Adryane,  
<span id="an_2182"></span> That is with slep for werynesse atake.  
<span id="an_2183"></span> Ful sorwefully hire herte may awake.  
<span id="an_2184"></span> Allas, for thee myn herte hath now pite!  
<span id="an_2185"></span> Ryght in the dawenyng awaketh she,  
<span id="an_2186"></span> And gropeth in the bed, and fond ryght

<span id="an_2188"></span> I am betrayed!" and hire her torente,  
<span id="an_2189"></span> And to the stronde barefot faste she wente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2190">2190</span></span> And cryed,
"Theseus, myn herte swete!  
<span id="an_2191"></span> Where be ye, that I may nat with yow mete,  
<span id="an_2192"></span> And myghte thus with bestes ben yslayn?"  
<span id="an_2193"></span> The holwe rokkes answerde hire agayn.  
<span id="an_2194"></span> No man she saw, and yit shyned the mone,  
<span id="an_2195"></span> And hye upon a rokke she wente sone,  
<span id="an_2196"></span> And saw his barge saylynge in the se.  
<span id="an_2197"></span> Cold wex hire herte, and ryght thus seyde

<span id="an_2199"></span> Hadde he nat synne that hire thus begylde?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2200">2200</span></span> She cryed,
"O turn ageyn, for routhe and synne!  
<span id="an_2201"></span> Thy barge hath nat al his meyne inne!"  
<span id="an_2202"></span> Hire coverchef on a pole up steked she,  
<span id="an_2203"></span> Ascaunce that he shulde it wel yse,  
<span id="an_2204"></span> And hym remembre that she was behynde,  
<span id="an_2205"></span> And turne ageyn, and on the stronde hire

<span id="an_2206"></span> But al for nought; his wey he is ygon.  
<span id="an_2207"></span> Adoun she fyl aswoune upon a ston;  
<span id="an_2208"></span> And up she rist, and kyssed, in al hire

<span id="an_2209"></span> The steppes of his fet ther he hath fare,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2210">2210</span></span> And to hire

<span id="an_2225"></span> I wol no more speke of this mateere;  
<span id="an_2226"></span> But thus this false lovere can begyle  
<span id="an_2227"></span> His trewe love, the devel quyte hym his

<span id="an_2228"></span> Thow yevere of the formes, that hast

<span id="an_2243"></span> The storye of Tereus, of which I tolde.  
<span id="an_2244"></span> Of Trace was he lord, and kyn to Marte,  
<span id="an_2245"></span> The crewel god that stant with blody darte;  
<span id="an_2246"></span> And wedded hadde he, with a blysful cheere,

<span id="an_2251"></span> But at the feste redy ben, ywis,

<span id="an_2253"></span> The oule al nyght aboute the balkes wond,  
<span id="an_2254"></span> That prophete is of wo and of myschaunce.  
<span id="an_2255"></span> This revel, ful of song and ek of daunce,  
<span id="an_2256"></span> Laste a fortenyght, or lytel lasse.  
<span id="an_2257"></span> But shortly of this story for to passe,  
<span id="an_2258"></span> For I am wery of hym for to telle,  
<span id="an_2259"></span> Fyve yer his wif and he togeder dwelle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2260">2260</span></span> Til on a

<span id="an_2262"></span> That for desyr she nyste what to seye.  
<span id="an_2263"></span> But to hire husbonde gan she for to preye,  
<span id="an_2264"></span> For Godes love, that she moste ones gon  
<span id="an_2265"></span> Hyre syster for to sen, and come anon,  
<span id="an_2266"></span> Or elles, but she moste to hire wende,  
<span id="an_2267"></span> She preyde hym that he wolde after hire
sende;  
<span id="an_2268"></span> And this was day by day al hire preyere,  
<span id="an_2269"></span> With al humblesse of wifhod, word and
chere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2270">2270</span></span> This Tereus
let make his shipes yare,  
<span id="an_2271"></span> And into Grece hymself is forth yfare.  
<span id="an_2272"></span> Unto his fadyr-in-lawe gan he preye  
<span id="an_2273"></span> To vouche-sauf that for a month or tweye  
<span id="an_2274"></span> That Philomene, his wyves syster, myghte  
<span id="an_2275"></span> On Progne his wyf but ones han a syghte --  
<span id="an_2276"></span> "And she shal come to yow ageyn anon.  
<span id="an_2277"></span> Myself with hyre wol bothe come and gon,  
<span id="an_2278"></span> And as myn hertes lyf I wol hire kepe."  
<span id="an_2279"></span> This olde Pandion, this kyng, gan wepe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2280">2280</span></span> For
tendernesse of herte for to leve  
<span id="an_2281"></span> His doughter gon, and for to yeve hire
leve;  
<span id="an_2282"></span> Of al this world he loveth nothyng so;  
<span id="an_2283"></span> But at the laste leve hath she to go.  
<span id="an_2284"></span> For Philomene with salte teres eke  
<span id="an_2285"></span> Gan of hire fader grace to beseke  
<span id="an_2286"></span> To sen hire syster that she loveth so,  
<span id="an_2287"></span> And hym embraseth with hire armes two.  
<span id="an_2288"></span> And therwithal so yong and fayr was she  
<span id="an_2289"></span> That, whan that Tereus saw hire beaute,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2290">2290</span></span> And of aray
that there was non hire lyche,  
<span id="an_2291"></span> And yit of beaute was she two so ryche,  
<span id="an_2292"></span> He caste his fyry herte upon hyre so  
<span id="an_2293"></span> That he wol have hir, how so that it go;  
<span id="an_2294"></span> And with his wiles kneled and so preyde,  
<span id="an_2295"></span> Tyl at the laste Pandyon thus seyde:  
<span id="an_2296"></span> "Now, sone," quod he, "that art to me so

<span id="an_2297"></span> I the betake my yonge doughter here  
<span id="an_2298"></span> That bereth the keye of al myn hertes lyf.  
<span id="an_2299"></span> And gret me wel my doughter and thy wif,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2300">2300</span></span> And yif

<span id="an_2301"></span> That she may sen me ones er I deye."  
<span id="an_2302"></span> And sothly, he hath mad hym riche feste,  
<span id="an_2303"></span> And to his folk, the moste and ek the

<span id="an_2306"></span> Of Athenes, and to the se hym broughte,  
<span id="an_2307"></span> And turneth hom; no malyce he ne thoughte.  
<span id="an_2308"></span> The ores pullen forth the vessel faste,  
<span id="an_2309"></span> And into Trace aryveth at the laste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2310">2310</span></span> And up into

<span id="an_2312"></span> And in this derke cave, yif hir leste,  
<span id="an_2313"></span> Or leste nat, he bad hire for to reste;  
<span id="an_2314"></span> Of which hire herte agros, and seyde thus:  
<span id="an_2315"></span> "Where is my sister, brother Tereus?"  
<span id="an_2316"></span> And therwithal she wepte tenderly  
<span id="an_2317"></span> And quok for fere, pale and pitously,  
<span id="an_2318"></span> Ryght as the lamb that of the wolf is

<span id="an_2319"></span> Or as the culver that of the egle is

<span id="an_2323"></span> But utterly it may non other be.  
<span id="an_2324"></span> By force hath this traytour don a dede,  
<span id="an_2325"></span> That he hath reft hire of hire maydenhede,  
<span id="an_2326"></span> Maugre hire hed, by strengthe and by his

<span id="an_2327"></span> Lo! here a dede of men, and that a ryght!  
<span id="an_2328"></span> She cryeth "Syster!" with ful loud a

<span id="an_2329"></span> And "Fader dere!" and "Help me, God in

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2330">2330</span></span> Al helpeth

<span id="an_2332"></span> For fere lest she shulde his shame crye  
<span id="an_2333"></span> And don hym openly a vilenye,  
<span id="an_2334"></span> And with his swerd hire tonge of kerveth

<span id="an_2335"></span> And in a castel made hire for to be  
<span id="an_2336"></span> Ful pryvely in prisoun everemore,  
<span id="an_2337"></span> And kepte hire to his usage and his store,  
<span id="an_2338"></span> So that she myghte hym neveremore asterte.  
<span id="an_2339"></span> O sely Philomene, wo is thyn herte!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2340">2340</span></span> God wreke

<span id="an_2341"></span> Now is it tyme I make an ende sone.  
<span id="an_2342"></span> This Tereus is to his wif ycome,  
<span id="an_2343"></span> And in his armes hath his wif ynome,  
<span id="an_2344"></span> And pitously he wep and shok his hed,  
<span id="an_2345"></span> And swor hir that he fond hir sister ded;  
<span id="an_2346"></span> For which this sely Progne hath swich wo  
<span id="an_2347"></span> That nygh hire sorweful herte brak a-two.  
<span id="an_2348"></span> And thus in terys lete I Progne dwelle,  
<span id="an_2349"></span> And of hire sister forth I wol yow telle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2350">2350</span></span> This woful
lady lerned hadde in youthe  
<span id="an_2351"></span> So that she werken and enbroude couthe,  
<span id="an_2352"></span> And weven in hire stol the radevore  
<span id="an_2353"></span> As it of wemen hath be woned yore.  
<span id="an_2354"></span> And, sothly for to seyne, she hadde hire
fille  
<span id="an_2355"></span> Of mete and drynk, and clothyng at hire

<span id="an_2356"></span> She coude eek rede and wel ynow endyte,  
<span id="an_2357"></span> But with a penne coude she nat wryte.  
<span id="an_2358"></span> But letters can she weve to and fro,  
<span id="an_2359"></span> So that, by that the yer was al ago,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2360">2360</span></span> She hadde
ywoven in a stamyn large  
<span id="an_2361"></span> How she was brought from Athenes in a

<span id="an_2362"></span> And in a cave how that she was brought;  
<span id="an_2363"></span> And al the thyng that Tereus hath wrought,  
<span id="an_2364"></span> She waf it wel, and wrot the storye above,  
<span id="an_2365"></span> How she was served for hire systers love.  
<span id="an_2366"></span> And to a knave a ryng she yaf anon,  
<span id="an_2367"></span> And preyed hym by signes for to gon  
<span id="an_2368"></span> Unto the queen, and beren hir that cloth,  
<span id="an_2369"></span> And by signes swor hym many an oth  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2370">2370</span></span> She wolde
hym yeven what she geten myghte.  
<span id="an_2371"></span> This knave anon unto the quene hym dyghte,  
<span id="an_2372"></span> And tok it hire, and al the maner tolde.  
<span id="an_2373"></span> And whan that Progne hath this thing
beholde,  
<span id="an_2374"></span> No word she spak, for sorwe and ek for
rage,  
<span id="an_2375"></span> But feynede hire to gon on pilgrymage  
<span id="an_2376"></span> To Bacus temple; and in a litel stounde  
<span id="an_2377"></span> Hire dombe sister sittynge hath she founde,  
<span id="an_2378"></span> Wepynge in the castel, here alone.  
<span id="an_2379"></span> Allas! The wo, the compleynt, and the mone  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2380">2380</span></span> That Progne

<span id="an_2381"></span> In armes everych of hem other taketh,  
<span id="an_2382"></span> And thus I late hem in here sorwe dwelle.  
<span id="an_2383"></span> The remenaunt is no charge for to telle,  
<span id="an_2384"></span> For this is al and som: thus was she
served,  
<span id="an_2385"></span> That nevere harm agilte ne deserved  
<span id="an_2386"></span> Unto this crewel man, that she of wiste.  
<span id="an_2387"></span> Ye may be war of men, if that yow liste.  
<span id="an_2388"></span> For al be it that he wol nat, for shame,  
<span id="an_2389"></span> Don as Tereus, to lese his name,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2390">2390</span></span> Ne serve

<span id="an_2393"></span> But it so be that he may have non other.  
<span id="an_2394"></span> By preve as wel as by autorite,  
<span id="an_2395"></span> That wiked fruit cometh of a wiked tre,  
<span id="an_2396"></span> That may ye fynde, if that it like yow.  
<span id="an_2397"></span> But for this ende I speke this as now,  
<span id="an_2398"></span> To tellen yow of false Demophon.  
<span id="an_2399"></span> In love a falser herde I nevere non,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2400">2400</span></span> But if it
were his fader Theseus.  
<span id="an_2401"></span> "God, for his grace, fro swich oon kepe
us!"  
<span id="an_2402"></span> Thus may these women preyen that it here.  
<span id="an_2403"></span> Now to the effect turne I of my matere.  
<span id="an_2404"></span> Destroyed is of Troye the cite;  
<span id="an_2405"></span> This Demophon com seylynge in the se  
<span id="an_2406"></span> Toward Athenes, to his paleys large.  
<span id="an_2407"></span> With hym com many a ship and many a barge  
<span id="an_2408"></span> Ful of his folk, of whiche ful many oon  
<span id="an_2409"></span> Is wounded sore, and sek, and wo begon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2410">2410</span></span> As they han
at th' asege longe yleyn.  
<span id="an_2411"></span> Byhynde hym com a wynd and ek a reyn  
<span id="an_2412"></span> That shof so sore his sayl ne myghte
stonde;  
<span id="an_2413"></span> Hym were levere than al the world a-londe,  
<span id="an_2414"></span> So hunteth hym the tempest to and fro.  
<span id="an_2415"></span> So derk it was, he coude nowher go;  
<span id="an_2416"></span> And with a wawe brosten was his stere.  
<span id="an_2417"></span> His ship was rent so lowe, in swich manere,  
<span id="an_2418"></span> That carpenter ne coude it nat amende.  
<span id="an_2419"></span> The se, by nyghte, as any torche it brende  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2420">2420</span></span> For wod,
and possith hym now up, now doun,  
<span id="an_2421"></span> Til Neptune hath of hym compassioun,  
<span id="an_2422"></span> And Thetis, Thorus, Triton, and they alle,  
<span id="an_2423"></span> And maden hym upon a lond to falle,  
<span id="an_2424"></span> Wherof that Phillis lady was and queene,  
<span id="an_2425"></span> Ligurges doughter, fayrer on to sene  
<span id="an_2426"></span> Than is the flour ageyn the bryghte sonne.  
<span id="an_2427"></span> Unnethe is Demophon to londe ywonne,  
<span id="an_2428"></span> Wayk, and ek wery, and his folk forpyned  
<span id="an_2429"></span> Of werynesse, and also enfamyned,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2430">2430</span></span> That to the
deth he almost was ydriven.  
<span id="an_2431"></span> His wise folk to conseyl han hym yiven  
<span id="an_2432"></span> To seken help and socour of the queen,  
<span id="an_2433"></span> And loke what his grace myghte been,  
<span id="an_2434"></span> And maken in that lond som chevysaunce,  
<span id="an_2435"></span> To kepen hym fro wo and fro myschaunce.  
<span id="an_2436"></span> For syk he was, and almost at the deth;  
<span id="an_2437"></span> Unnethe myghte he speke or drawe his breth,  
<span id="an_2438"></span> And lyth in Rodopeya hym for to reste.  
<span id="an_2439"></span> Whan he may walke, hym thoughte it was the
beste  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2440">2440</span></span> Unto the
court to seken for socour.  
<span id="an_2441"></span> Men knewen hym wel and diden hym honour;  
<span id="an_2442"></span> For of Athenes duk and lord was he,  
<span id="an_2443"></span> As Theseus his fader hadde be,  
<span id="an_2444"></span> That in his tyme was of gret renoun,  
<span id="an_2445"></span> No man so gret in al the regyoun,  
<span id="an_2446"></span> And lyk his fader of face and of stature,  
<span id="an_2447"></span> And fals of love; it com hym of nature.  
<span id="an_2448"></span> As doth the fox Renard, the foxes sone,  
<span id="an_2449"></span> Of kynde he coude his olde faders wone  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2450">2450</span></span> Withoute
lore, as can a drake swimme  
<span id="an_2451"></span> Whan it is caught and caryed to the brymme.  
<span id="an_2452"></span> This honurable Phillis doth hym chere;  
<span id="an_2453"></span> Hire liketh wel his port and his manere.  
<span id="an_2454"></span> But, for I am agroted herebyforn  
<span id="an_2455"></span> To wryte of hem that ben in love forsworn,  
<span id="an_2456"></span> And ek to haste me in my legende,  
<span id="an_2457"></span> (Which to performe God me grace sende)  
<span id="an_2458"></span> Therfore I passe shortly in this wyse.  
<span id="an_2459"></span> Ye han wel herd of Theseus devyse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2460">2460</span></span> In the
betraysynge of fayre Adryane  
<span id="an_2461"></span> That of hire pite kepte him from his bane.  
<span id="an_2462"></span> At shorte wordes, ryght so Demophon  
<span id="an_2463"></span> The same wey, the same path hath gon,  
<span id="an_2464"></span> That dide his false fader Theseus.  
<span id="an_2465"></span> For unto Phillis hath he sworen thus,  
<span id="an_2466"></span> To wedden hire, and hire his trouthe
plyghte,  
<span id="an_2467"></span> And piked of hire al the good he myghte,  
<span id="an_2468"></span> Whan he was hol and sound, and hadde his
reste;  
<span id="an_2469"></span> And doth with Phillis what so that hym
leste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2470">2470</span></span> As wel
coude I, if that me leste so,  
<span id="an_2471"></span> Tellen al his doynge to and fro.  
<span id="an_2472"></span> He seyde unto his contre moste he sayle,  
<span id="an_2473"></span> For there he wolde hire weddynge aparayle,  
<span id="an_2474"></span> As fel to hire honour and his also.  
<span id="an_2475"></span> And openly he tok his leve tho,  
<span id="an_2476"></span> And hath hire sworn he wolde nat sojorne,  
<span id="an_2477"></span> But in a month he wolde ageyn retorne;  
<span id="an_2478"></span> And in that lond let make his ordenaunce  
<span id="an_2479"></span> As verray lord, and tok the obeysaunce  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2480">2480</span></span> Wel and
homly, and let his shipes dighte,  
<span id="an_2481"></span> And hom he goth the nexte wey he myghte.  
<span id="an_2482"></span> For unto Phillis yit ne com he nought,  
<span id="an_2483"></span> And that hath she so harde and sore abought
--  
<span id="an_2484"></span> Allas! -- that, as the storyes us recorde,  
<span id="an_2485"></span> She was hire owene deth ryght with a corde,  
<span id="an_2486"></span> Whan that she saw that Demophon hire
trayed.  
<span id="an_2487"></span> But to hym first she wrot, and faste him
prayed  
<span id="an_2488"></span> He wolde come and hire delyvere of peyne,  
<span id="an_2489"></span> As I reherce shal a word or tweyne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2490">2490</span></span> Me lyste
nat vouche-sauf on hym to swynke,  
<span id="an_2491"></span> Ne spende on hym a penne ful of ynke,  
<span id="an_2492"></span> For fals in love was he, ryght as his syre.  
<span id="an_2493"></span> The devil sette here soules bothe afyre!  
<span id="an_2494"></span> But of the letter of Phillis wol I wryte  
<span id="an_2495"></span> A word or two, althogh it be but lyte.  
<span id="an_2496"></span> "Thyn hostesse," quod she, "O Demophon,  
<span id="an_2497"></span> Thy Phillis, which that is so wo begon,  
<span id="an_2498"></span> Of Rodopeye, upon yow mot compleyne  
<span id="an_2499"></span> Over the terme set bytwixe us tweyne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2500">2500</span></span> That ye ne
holde forward, as ye seyde.  
<span id="an_2501"></span> Youre anker, which ye in oure haven leyde,  
<span id="an_2502"></span> Hyghte us that ye wolde comen, out of
doute,  
<span id="an_2503"></span> Or that the mone wente ones aboute.  
<span id="an_2504"></span> But tymes foure the mone hath hid hire
face,  
<span id="an_2505"></span> Syn thilke day ye wente from this place,  
<span id="an_2506"></span> And foure tymes lyghte the world ageyn.  
<span id="an_2507"></span> But for al that, yif I shal soothly seyn,  
<span id="an_2508"></span> Yit hath the strem of Sytho nat ybrought  
<span id="an_2509"></span> From Athenes the ship; yit cometh it noght.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2510">2510</span></span> And if that
ye the terme rekene wolde  
<span id="an_2511"></span> As I or as a trewe lovere shulde,  
<span id="an_2512"></span> I pleyne nat, God wot, byforn my day."  
<span id="an_2513"></span> But al hire letter wryten I ne may  
<span id="an_2514"></span> By order, for it were to me a charge;  
<span id="an_2515"></span> Hire letter was ryght long and therto
large.  
<span id="an_2516"></span> But here and ther in rym I have it layd,  
<span id="an_2517"></span> There as me thoughte that she wel hath
sayd.  
<span id="an_2518"></span> She seyde, "Thy sayles come nat agen,  
<span id="an_2519"></span> Ne to thy word there is no fey certeyn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2520">2520</span></span> But I wot

<span id="an_2553"></span> Withoute sepulture and buryinge,  
<span id="an_2554"></span> Thogh ye ben harder than is any ston."  
<span id="an_2555"></span> And whan this letter was forth sent anon,  
<span id="an_2556"></span> And knew how brotel and how fals he was,  
<span id="an_2557"></span> She for dispeyr fordide hyreself, allas.  
<span id="an_2558"></span> Swych sorwe hath she, for she besette hire

<span id="an_2561"></span> And trusteth, as in love, no man but me.  
<span id="an_2562"></span> In Grece whilom weren brethren two,  
<span id="an_2563"></span> Of whiche that oon was called Danao,  
<span id="an_2564"></span> That many a sone hath of his body wonne,  
<span id="an_2565"></span> As swiche false lovers ofte conne.  
<span id="an_2566"></span> Among his sones alle there was oon  
<span id="an_2567"></span> That aldermost he lovede of everychoon.  
<span id="an_2568"></span> And whan this child was born, this Danao  
<span id="an_2569"></span> Shop hym a name and callede hym Lyno.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2570">2570</span></span> That other
brother called was Egiste,  
<span id="an_2571"></span> That was of love as fals as evere hym
liste,  
<span id="an_2572"></span> And many a doughter gat he in his lyf;  
<span id="an_2573"></span> Of whiche he gat upon his ryghte wyf  
<span id="an_2574"></span> A doughter dere, and dide hire for to calle  
<span id="an_2575"></span> Ypermystra, yongeste of hem alle.  
<span id="an_2576"></span> The whiche child of hire natyvyte  
<span id="an_2577"></span> To alle thewes goode yborn was she,  
<span id="an_2578"></span> As likede to the goddes er she was born,  
<span id="an_2579"></span> That of the shef she sholde be the corn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2580">2580</span></span> The Wirdes,
that we clepen Destine,  
<span id="an_2581"></span> Hath shapen hire that she mot nedes be  
<span id="an_2582"></span> Pyetous, sad, wis, and trewe as stel,  
<span id="an_2583"></span> As to these wemen it acordeth wel.  
<span id="an_2584"></span> For thogh that Venus yaf hire gret beaute,  
<span id="an_2585"></span> With Jupiter compouned so was she  
<span id="an_2586"></span> That conscience, trouthe, and drede of

<span id="an_2587"></span> And of hyre wifhod for to kepe hire name,  
<span id="an_2588"></span> This, thoughte hire, was felycite as here.  
<span id="an_2589"></span> The rede Mars was that tyme of the yeere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2590">2590</span></span> So feble
that his malyce is hym raft;  
<span id="an_2591"></span> Repressed hath Venus his crewel craft,  
<span id="an_2592"></span> That, what with Venus and other oppressioun  
<span id="an_2593"></span> Of houses, Mars his venim is adoun,  
<span id="an_2594"></span> That Ypermystra dar nat handle a knyf  
<span id="an_2595"></span> In malyce, thogh she shulde lese hire lyf.  
<span id="an_2596"></span> But natheles, as hevene gan tho turne,  
<span id="an_2597"></span> To badde aspectes hath she of Saturne,  
<span id="an_2598"></span> That made hire for to deyen in prisoun,  
<span id="an_2599"></span> As I shal after make mencioun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2600">2600</span></span> To Danao
and Egistes also,  
<span id="an_2601"></span> Althogh so be that they were brethren two
--  
<span id="an_2602"></span> For thilke tyme was spared no lynage --  
<span id="an_2603"></span> It lykede hem to make a maryage  
<span id="an_2604"></span> Bytwixen Ypermystre and hym Lyno,  
<span id="an_2605"></span> And casten swich a day it shal be so,  
<span id="an_2606"></span> And ful acorded was it utterly;  
<span id="an_2607"></span> The aray is wrought, the tyme is faste by.  
<span id="an_2608"></span> And thus Lyno hath of his faders brother  
<span id="an_2609"></span> The doughter wedded, and ech of hem hath
other.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2610">2610</span></span> The torches
brennen, and the laumpes bryghte;  
<span id="an_2611"></span> The sacryfices ben ful redy dighte;  
<span id="an_2612"></span> Th' encens out of the fyre reketh sote;  
<span id="an_2613"></span> The flour, the lef is rent up by the rote  
<span id="an_2614"></span> To maken garlondes and crounes hye.  
<span id="an_2615"></span> Ful is the place of soun of minstralsye,  
<span id="an_2616"></span> Of songes amorous of maryage,  
<span id="an_2617"></span> As thylke tyme was the pleyne usage.  
<span id="an_2618"></span> And this was in the paleys of Egiste,  
<span id="an_2619"></span> That in his hous was lord, ryght as hym
lyste.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2620">2620</span></span> And thus

<span id="an_2622"></span> The nyght is come, the bryd shal go to

<span id="an_2623"></span> Egistus to his chamber faste hym spedde,  
<span id="an_2624"></span> And prively he let his doughter calle.  
<span id="an_2625"></span> Whan that the hous was voyded of hem alle,  
<span id="an_2626"></span> He loketh on his doughter with glad chere
