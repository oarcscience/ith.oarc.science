#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Pardoner's Tale

<span id="an_463"></span> In Flaundres whilom was a compaignye  
<span id="an_464"></span> Of yonge folk that haunteden folye,  
<span id="an_465"></span> As riot, hasard, stywes, and tavernes,  
<span id="an_466"></span> Where as with harpes, lutes, and gyternes,  
<span id="an_467"></span> They daunce and pleyen at dees bothe day and
nyght,  
<span id="an_468"></span> And eten also and drynken over hir myght,  
<span id="an_469"></span> Thurgh which they doon the devel sacrifise  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> Withinne that
develes temple in cursed wise  
<span id="an_471"></span> By superfluytee abhomynable.  
<span id="an_472"></span> Hir othes been so grete and so dampnable  
<span id="an_473"></span> That it is grisly for to heere hem swere.  
<span id="an_474"></span> Oure blissed Lordes body they totere --  
<span id="an_475"></span> Hem thoughte that Jewes rente hym noght ynough
--  
<span id="an_476"></span> And ech of hem at otheres synne lough.  
<span id="an_477"></span> And right anon thanne comen tombesteres  
<span id="an_478"></span> Fetys and smale, and yonge frutesteres,  
<span id="an_479"></span> Syngeres with harpes, baudes, wafereres,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> Whiche been
the verray develes officeres  
<span id="an_481"></span> To kyndle and blowe the fyr of lecherye,  
<span id="an_482"></span> That is annexed unto glotonye.  
<span id="an_483"></span> The hooly writ take I to my witnesse  
<span id="an_484"></span> That luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse.  
<span id="an_485"></span> Lo, how that dronken Looth, unkyndely,  
<span id="an_486"></span> Lay by his doghtres two, unwityngly;  
<span id="an_487"></span> So dronke he was, he nyste what he wroghte.  
<span id="an_488"></span> Herodes, whoso wel the stories soghte,  
<span id="an_489"></span> Whan he of wyn was repleet at his feeste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> Right at his
owene table he yaf his heeste  
<span id="an_491"></span> To sleen the Baptist John, ful giltelees.  
<span id="an_492"></span> Senec seith a good word doutelees;  
<span id="an_493"></span> He seith he kan no difference fynde  
<span id="an_494"></span> Bitwix a man that is out of his mynde  
<span id="an_495"></span> And a man which that is dronkelewe,  
<span id="an_496"></span> But that woodnesse, yfallen in a shrewe,  
<span id="an_497"></span> Persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse.  
<span id="an_498"></span> O glotonye, ful of cursednesse!  
<span id="an_499"></span> O cause first of oure confusioun!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> O original of
oure dampnacioun,  
<span id="an_501"></span> Til Crist hadde boght us with his blood
agayn!  
<span id="an_502"></span> Lo, how deere, shortly for to sayn,  
<span id="an_503"></span> Aboght was thilke cursed vileynye!  
<span id="an_504"></span> Corrupt was al this world for glotonye.  
<span id="an_505"></span> Adam oure fader, and his wyf also,  
<span id="an_506"></span> Fro Paradys to labour and to wo  
<span id="an_507"></span> Were dryven for that vice, it is no drede.  
<span id="an_508"></span> For whil that Adam fasted, as I rede,  
<span id="an_509"></span> He was in Paradys; and whan that he  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> Eet of the
fruyt deffended on the tree,  
<span id="an_511"></span> Anon he was out cast to wo and peyne.  
<span id="an_512"></span> O glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne!  
<span id="an_513"></span> O, wiste a man how manye maladyes  
<span id="an_514"></span> Folwen of excesse and of glotonyes,  
<span id="an_515"></span> He wolde been the moore mesurable  
<span id="an_516"></span> Of his diete, sittynge at his table.  
<span id="an_517"></span> Allas, the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,  
<span id="an_518"></span> Maketh that est and west and north and
south,  
<span id="an_519"></span> In erthe, in eir, in water, men to swynke  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> To gete a
glotoun deyntee mete and drynke!  
<span id="an_521"></span> Of this matiere, O Paul, wel kanstow trete:  
<span id="an_522"></span> "Mete unto wombe, and wombe eek unto mete,  
<span id="an_523"></span> Shal God destroyen bothe," as Paulus seith.  
<span id="an_524"></span> Allas, a foul thyng is it, by my feith,  
<span id="an_525"></span> To seye this word, and fouler is the dede,  
<span id="an_526"></span> Whan man so drynketh of the white and rede  
<span id="an_527"></span> That of his throte he maketh his pryvee  
<span id="an_528"></span> Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee.  
<span id="an_529"></span> The apostel wepyng seith ful pitously,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> "Ther walken
manye of whiche yow toold have I --  
<span id="an_531"></span> I seye it now wepyng, with pitous voys --  
<span id="an_532"></span> They been enemys of Cristes croys,  
<span id="an_533"></span> Of whiche the ende is deeth; wombe is hir
god!"  
<span id="an_534"></span> O wombe! O bely! O stynkyng cod,  
<span id="an_535"></span> Fulfilled of dong and of corrupcioun!  
<span id="an_536"></span> At either ende of thee foul is the soun.  
<span id="an_537"></span> How greet labour and cost is thee to fynde!  
<span id="an_538"></span> Thise cookes, how they stampe, and streyne,
and grynde,  
<span id="an_539"></span> And turnen substaunce into accident  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> To fulfille
al thy likerous talent!  
<span id="an_541"></span> Out of the harde bones knokke they  
<span id="an_542"></span> The mary, for they caste noght awey  
<span id="an_543"></span> That may go thurgh the golet softe and
swoote.  
<span id="an_544"></span> Of spicerie of leef, and bark, and roote  
<span id="an_545"></span> Shal been his sauce ymaked by delit,  
<span id="an_546"></span> To make hym yet a newer appetit.  
<span id="an_547"></span> But, certes, he that haunteth swiche delices  
<span id="an_548"></span> Is deed, whil that he lyveth in tho vices.  
<span id="an_549"></span> A lecherous thyng is wyn, and dronkenesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> Is ful of
stryvyng and of wrecchednesse.  
<span id="an_551"></span> O dronke man, disfigured is thy face,  
<span id="an_552"></span> Sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace,  
<span id="an_553"></span> And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun  
<span id="an_554"></span> As though thou seydest ay "Sampsoun,
Sampsoun!"  
<span id="an_555"></span> And yet, God woot, Sampsoun drank nevere no
wyn.  
<span id="an_556"></span> Thou fallest as it were a styked swyn;  
<span id="an_557"></span> Thy tonge is lost, and al thyn honeste cure,  
<span id="an_558"></span> For dronkenesse is verray sepulture  
<span id="an_559"></span> Of mannes wit and his discrecioun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> In whom that
drynke hath dominacioun  
<span id="an_561"></span> He kan no conseil kepe; it is no drede.  
<span id="an_562"></span> Now kepe yow fro the white and fro the rede,  
<span id="an_563"></span> And namely fro the white wyn of Lepe  
<span id="an_564"></span> That is to selle in Fysshstrete or in Chepe.  
<span id="an_565"></span> This wyn of Spaigne crepeth subtilly  
<span id="an_566"></span> In othere wynes, growynge faste by,  
<span id="an_567"></span> Of which ther ryseth swich fumositee  
<span id="an_568"></span> That whan a man hath dronken draughtes thre,  
<span id="an_569"></span> And weneth that he be at hoom in Chepe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> He is in
Spaigne, right at the toune of Lepe --  
<span id="an_571"></span> Nat at the Rochele, ne at Burdeux toun --  
<span id="an_572"></span> And thanne wol he seye "Sampsoun, Sampsoun!"  
<span id="an_573"></span> But herkneth, lordynges, o word, I yow
preye,  
<span id="an_574"></span> That alle the sovereyn actes, dar I seye,  
<span id="an_575"></span> Of victories in the Olde Testament,  
<span id="an_576"></span> Thurgh verray God, that is omnipotent,  
<span id="an_577"></span> Were doon in abstinence and in preyere.  
<span id="an_578"></span> Looketh the Bible, and ther ye may it leere.  
<span id="an_579"></span> Looke, Attilla, the grete conquerour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> Deyde in his
sleep, with shame and dishonour,  
<span id="an_581"></span> Bledynge ay at his nose in dronkenesse.  
<span id="an_582"></span> A capitayn sholde lyve in sobrenesse.  
<span id="an_583"></span> And over al this, avyseth yow right wel  
<span id="an_584"></span> What was comaunded unto Lamuel --  
<span id="an_585"></span> Nat Samuel, but Lamuel, seye I;  
<span id="an_586"></span> Redeth the Bible, and fynde it expresly  
<span id="an_587"></span> Of wyn-yevyng to hem that han justise.  
<span id="an_588"></span> Namoore of this, for it may wel suffise.  
<span id="an_589"></span> And now that I have spoken of glotonye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> Now wol I yow
deffenden hasardrye.  
<span id="an_591"></span> Hasard is verray mooder of lesynges,  
<span id="an_592"></span> And of deceite, and cursed forswerynges,  
<span id="an_593"></span> Blaspheme of Crist, manslaughtre, and wast
also  
<span id="an_594"></span> Of catel and of tyme; and forthermo,  
<span id="an_595"></span> It is repreeve and contrarie of honour  
<span id="an_596"></span> For to ben holde a commune hasardour.  
<span id="an_597"></span> And ever the hyer he is of estaat,  
<span id="an_598"></span> The moore is he yholden desolaat.  
<span id="an_599"></span> If that a prynce useth hasardrye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> In alle
governaunce and policye  
<span id="an_601"></span> He is, as by commune opinioun,  
<span id="an_602"></span> Yholde the lasse in reputacioun.  
<span id="an_603"></span> Stilboun, that was a wys embassadour,  
<span id="an_604"></span> Was sent to Corynthe in ful greet honour  
<span id="an_605"></span> Fro Lacidomye to make hire alliaunce.  
<span id="an_606"></span> And whan he cam, hym happede, par chaunce,  
<span id="an_607"></span> That alle the gretteste that were of that
lond,  
<span id="an_608"></span> Pleyynge atte hasard he hem fond.  
<span id="an_609"></span> For which, as soone as it myghte be,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> He stal hym
hoom agayn to his contree,  
<span id="an_611"></span> And seyde, "Ther wol I nat lese my name,  
<span id="an_612"></span> Ne I wol nat take on me so greet defame,  
<span id="an_613"></span> Yow for to allie unto none hasardours.  
<span id="an_614"></span> Sendeth othere wise embassadours;  
<span id="an_615"></span> For, by my trouthe, me were levere dye  
<span id="an_616"></span> Than I yow sholde to hasardours allye.  
<span id="an_617"></span> For ye, that been so glorious in honours,  
<span id="an_618"></span> Shul nat allyen yow with hasardours  
<span id="an_619"></span> As by my wyl, ne as by my tretee."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> This wise
philosophre, thus seyde hee.  
<span id="an_621"></span> Looke eek that to the kyng Demetrius  
<span id="an_622"></span> The kyng of Parthes, as the book seith us,  
<span id="an_623"></span> Sente him a paire of dees of gold in scorn,  
<span id="an_624"></span> For he hadde used hasard ther-biforn;  
<span id="an_625"></span> For which he heeld his glorie or his renoun  
<span id="an_626"></span> At no value or reputacioun.  
<span id="an_627"></span> Lordes may fynden oother maner pley  
<span id="an_628"></span> Honest ynough to dryve the day awey.  
<span id="an_629"></span> Now wol I speke of othes false and grete  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> A word or
two, as olde bookes trete.  
<span id="an_631"></span> Gret sweryng is a thyng abhominable,  
<span id="an_632"></span> And fals sweryng is yet moore reprevable.  
<span id="an_633"></span> The heighe God forbad sweryng at al,  
<span id="an_634"></span> Witnesse on Mathew; but in special  
<span id="an_635"></span> Of sweryng seith the hooly Jeremye,  
<span id="an_636"></span> "Thou shalt swere sooth thyne othes, and nat
lye,  
<span id="an_637"></span> And swere in doom and eek in rightwisnesse";  
<span id="an_638"></span> But ydel sweryng is a cursednesse.  
<span id="an_639"></span> Bihoold and se that in the firste table  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> Of heighe
Goddes heestes honurable,  
<span id="an_641"></span> Hou that the seconde heeste of hym is this:  
<span id="an_642"></span> "Take nat my name in ydel or amys."  
<span id="an_643"></span> Lo, rather he forbedeth swich sweryng  
<span id="an_644"></span> Than homycide or many a cursed thyng;  
<span id="an_645"></span> I seye that, as by ordre, thus it stondeth;  
<span id="an_646"></span> This knoweth, that his heestes
understondeth,  
<span id="an_647"></span> How that the seconde heeste of God is that.  
<span id="an_648"></span> And forther over, I wol thee telle al plat  
<span id="an_649"></span> That vengeance shal nat parten from his hous  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> That of his
othes is to outrageous.  
<span id="an_651"></span> "By Goddes precious herte," and "By his
nayles,"  
<span id="an_652"></span> And "By the blood of Crist that is in
Hayles,  
<span id="an_653"></span> Sevene is my chaunce, and thyn is cynk and
treye!"  
<span id="an_654"></span> "By Goddes armes, if thou falsly pleye,  
<span id="an_655"></span> This daggere shal thurghout thyn herte go!"
--  
<span id="an_656"></span> This fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two,  
<span id="an_657"></span> Forsweryng, ire, falsnesse, homycide.  
<span id="an_658"></span> Now, for the love of Crist, that for us
dyde,  
<span id="an_659"></span> Lete youre othes, bothe grete and smale.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> But, sires,
now wol I telle forth my tale.  
<span id="an_661"></span> Thise riotoures thre of whiche I telle,  
<span id="an_662"></span> Longe erst er prime rong of any belle,  
<span id="an_663"></span> Were set hem in a taverne to drynke,  
<span id="an_664"></span> And as they sat, they herde a belle clynke  
<span id="an_665"></span> Biforn a cors, was caried to his grave.  
<span id="an_666"></span> That oon of hem gan callen to his knave:  
<span id="an_667"></span> "Go bet," quod he, "and axe redily  
<span id="an_668"></span> What cors is this that passeth heer forby;  
<span id="an_669"></span> And looke that thou reporte his name weel."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> "Sire," quod
this boy, "it nedeth never-a-deel;  
<span id="an_671"></span> It was me toold er ye cam heer two houres.  
<span id="an_672"></span> He was, pardee, an old felawe of youres,  
<span id="an_673"></span> And sodeynly he was yslayn to-nyght,  
<span id="an_674"></span> Fordronke, as he sat on his bench upright.  
<span id="an_675"></span> Ther cam a privee theef men clepeth Deeth,  
<span id="an_676"></span> That in this contree al the peple sleeth,  
<span id="an_677"></span> And with his spere he smoot his herte atwo,  
<span id="an_678"></span> And wente his wey withouten wordes mo.  
<span id="an_679"></span> He hath a thousand slayn this pestilence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> And, maister,
er ye come in his presence,  
<span id="an_681"></span> Me thynketh that it were necessarie  
<span id="an_682"></span> For to be war of swich an adversarie.  
<span id="an_683"></span> Beth redy for to meete hym everemoore;  
<span id="an_684"></span> Thus taughte me my dame; I sey namoore."  
<span id="an_685"></span> "By Seinte Marie!" seyde this taverner,  
<span id="an_686"></span> "The child seith sooth, for he hath slayn this
yeer,  
<span id="an_687"></span> Henne over a mile, withinne a greet village,  
<span id="an_688"></span> Bothe man and womman, child, and hyne, and
page;  
<span id="an_689"></span> I trowe his habitacioun be there.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> To been
avysed greet wysdom it were,  
<span id="an_691"></span> Er that he dide a man a dishonour."  
<span id="an_692"></span> "Ye, Goddes armes!" quod this riotour,  
<span id="an_693"></span> "Is it swich peril with hym for to meete?  
<span id="an_694"></span> I shal hym seke by wey and eek by strete,  
<span id="an_695"></span> I make avow to Goddes digne bones!  
<span id="an_696"></span> Herkneth, felawes, we thre been al ones;  
<span id="an_697"></span> Lat ech of us holde up his hand til oother,  
<span id="an_698"></span> And ech of us bicomen otheres brother,  
<span id="an_699"></span> And we wol sleen this false traytour Deeth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> He shal be
slayn, he that so manye sleeth,  
<span id="an_701"></span> By Goddes dignitee, er it be nyght!"  
<span id="an_702"></span> Togidres han thise thre hir trouthes plight  
<span id="an_703"></span> To lyve and dyen ech of hem for oother,  
<span id="an_704"></span> As though he were his owene ybore brother.  
<span id="an_705"></span> And up they stirte, al dronken in this rage,  
<span id="an_706"></span> And forth they goon towardes that village  
<span id="an_707"></span> Of which the taverner hadde spoke biforn.  
<span id="an_708"></span> And many a grisly ooth thanne han they
sworn,  
<span id="an_709"></span> And Cristes blessed body they torente --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> Deeth shal be
deed, if that they may hym hente!  
<span id="an_711"></span> Whan they han goon nat fully half a mile,  
<span id="an_712"></span> Right as they wolde han troden over a stile,  
<span id="an_713"></span> An oold man and a povre with hem mette.  
<span id="an_714"></span> This olde man ful mekely hem grette,  
<span id="an_715"></span> And seyde thus, "Now, lordes, God yow see!"  
<span id="an_716"></span> The proudeste of thise riotoures three  
<span id="an_717"></span> Answerde agayn, "What, carl, with sory
grace!  
<span id="an_718"></span> Why artow al forwrapped save thy face?  
<span id="an_719"></span> Why lyvestow so longe in so greet age?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> This olde man
gan looke in his visage,  
<span id="an_721"></span> And seyde thus: "For I ne kan nat fynde  
<span id="an_722"></span> A man, though that I walked into Ynde,

<span id="an_879"></span> What nedeth it to sermone of it moore?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> For right as
they hadde cast his deeth bifoore,
