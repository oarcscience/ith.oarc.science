#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Prioress' Tale

<span id="an_488"></span> Ther was in Asye, in a greet citee,  
<span id="an_489"></span> Amonges Cristene folk a Jewerye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> Sustened by a
lord of that contree  
<span id="an_491"></span> For foule usure and lucre of vileynye,  
<span id="an_492"></span> Hateful to Crist and to his compaignye;  
<span id="an_493"></span> And thurgh the strete men myghte ride or
wende,  
<span id="an_494"></span> For it was free and open at eyther ende.  
<span id="an_495"></span> A litel scole of Cristen folk ther stood  
<span id="an_496"></span> Doun at the ferther ende, in which ther were  
<span id="an_497"></span> Children an heep, ycomen of Cristen blood,  
<span id="an_498"></span> That lerned in that scole yeer by yere  
<span id="an_499"></span> Swich manere doctrine as men used there,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> This is to
seyn, to syngen and to rede,  
<span id="an_501"></span> As smale children doon in hire childhede.  
<span id="an_502"></span> Among thise children was a wydwes sone,  
<span id="an_503"></span> A litel clergeon, seven yeer of age,  
<span id="an_504"></span> That day by day to scole was his wone,  
<span id="an_505"></span> And eek also, where as he saugh th' ymage  
<span id="an_506"></span> Of Cristes mooder, hadde he in usage,  
<span id="an_507"></span> As hym was taught, to knele adoun and seye  
<span id="an_508"></span> His Ave Marie, as he goth by the weye.  
<span id="an_509"></span> Thus hath this wydwe hir litel sone ytaught  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> Oure blisful
Lady, Cristes mooder deere,  
<span id="an_511"></span> To worshipe ay, and he forgat it naught,  
<span id="an_512"></span> For sely child wol alday soone leere.  
<span id="an_513"></span> But ay, whan I remembre on this mateere,  
<span id="an_514"></span> Seint Nicholas stant evere in my presence,  
<span id="an_515"></span> For he so yong to Crist dide reverence.  
<span id="an_516"></span> This litel child, his litel book lernynge,  
<span id="an_517"></span> As he sat in the scole at his prymer,  
<span id="an_518"></span> He Alma redemptoris herde synge,  
<span id="an_519"></span> As children lerned hire antiphoner;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> And as he
dorste, he drough hym ner and ner,  
<span id="an_521"></span> And herkned ay the wordes and the noote,  
<span id="an_522"></span> Til he the firste vers koude al by rote.  
<span id="an_523"></span> Noght wiste he what this Latyn was to seye,  
<span id="an_524"></span> For he so yong and tendre was of age.  
<span id="an_525"></span> But on a day his felawe gan he preye  
<span id="an_526"></span> T' expounden hym this song in his langage,  
<span id="an_527"></span> Or telle hym why this song was in usage;  
<span id="an_528"></span> This preyde he hym to construe and declare  
<span id="an_529"></span> Ful often tyme upon his knowes bare.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> His felawe,
which that elder was than he,  
<span id="an_531"></span> Answerde hym thus: "This song, I have herd
seye,  
<span id="an_532"></span> Was maked of our blisful Lady free,  
<span id="an_533"></span> Hire to salue, and eek hire for to preye  
<span id="an_534"></span> To been oure help and socour whan we deye.  
<span id="an_535"></span> I kan namoore expounde in this mateere.  
<span id="an_536"></span> I lerne song; I kan but smal grammeere."  
<span id="an_537"></span> "And is this song maked in reverence  
<span id="an_538"></span> Of Cristes mooder?" seyde this innocent.  
<span id="an_539"></span> "Now, certes, I wol do my diligence  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> To konne it
al er Cristemasse be went.  
<span id="an_541"></span> Though that I for my prymer shal be shent  
<span id="an_542"></span> And shal be beten thries in an houre,  
<span id="an_543"></span> I wol it konne Oure Lady for to honoure!"  
<span id="an_544"></span> His felawe taughte hym homward prively,  
<span id="an_545"></span> Fro day to day, til he koude it by rote,  
<span id="an_546"></span> And thanne he song it wel and boldely,  
<span id="an_547"></span> Fro word to word, acordynge with the note.  
<span id="an_548"></span> Twies a day it passed thurgh his throte,  
<span id="an_549"></span> To scoleward and homward whan he wente;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> On Cristes
mooder set was his entente.  
<span id="an_551"></span> As I have seyd, thurghout the Juerie  
<span id="an_552"></span> This litel child, as he cam to and fro,  
<span id="an_553"></span> Ful murily than wolde he synge and crie  
<span id="an_554"></span> O Alma redemptoris everemo.  
<span id="an_555"></span> The swetnesse his herte perced so  
<span id="an_556"></span> Of Cristes mooder that, to hire to preye,  
<span id="an_557"></span> He kan nat stynte of syngyng by the weye.  
<span id="an_558"></span> Oure firste foo, the serpent Sathanas,  
<span id="an_559"></span> That hath in Jues herte his waspes nest,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> Up swal, and
seide, "O Hebrayk peple, allas!  
<span id="an_561"></span> Is this to yow a thyng that is honest,  
<span id="an_562"></span> That swich a boy shal walken as hym lest  
<span id="an_563"></span> In youre despit, and synge of swich
sentence,  
<span id="an_564"></span> Which is agayn youre lawes reverence?"  
<span id="an_565"></span> Fro thennes forth the Jues han conspired  
<span id="an_566"></span> This innocent out of this world to chace.  
<span id="an_567"></span> An homycide therto han they hyred,  
<span id="an_568"></span> That in an aleye hadde a privee place;  
<span id="an_569"></span> And as the child gan forby for to pace,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> This cursed
Jew hym hente, and heeld hym faste,  
<span id="an_571"></span> And kitte his throte, and in a pit hym
caste.  
<span id="an_572"></span> I seye that in a wardrobe they hym threwe  
<span id="an_573"></span> Where as thise Jewes purgen hire entraille.  
<span id="an_574"></span> O cursed folk of Herodes al newe,  
<span id="an_575"></span> What may youre yvel entente yow availle?  
<span id="an_576"></span> Mordre wol out, certeyn, it wol nat faille,  
<span id="an_577"></span> And namely ther th' onour of God shal
sprede;  
<span id="an_578"></span> The blood out crieth on youre cursed dede.  
<span id="an_579"></span> O martir, sowded to virginitee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> Now maystow
syngen, folwynge evere in oon  
<span id="an_581"></span> The white Lamb celestial -- quod she --  
<span id="an_582"></span> Of which the grete evaungelist, Seint John,  
<span id="an_583"></span> In Pathmos wroot, which seith that they that
goon  
<span id="an_584"></span> Biforn this Lamb and synge a song al newe,  
<span id="an_585"></span> That nevere, flesshly, wommen they ne knewe.  
<span id="an_586"></span> This poure wydwe awaiteth al that nyght  
<span id="an_587"></span> After hir litel child, but he cam noght;  
<span id="an_588"></span> For which, as soone as it was dayes lyght,  
<span id="an_589"></span> With face pale of drede and bisy thoght,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> She hath at
scole and elleswhere hym soght,  
<span id="an_591"></span> Til finally she gan so fer espie  
<span id="an_592"></span> That he last seyn was in the Juerie.  
<span id="an_593"></span> With moodres pitee in hir brest enclosed,  
<span id="an_594"></span> She gooth, as she were half out of hir
mynde,  
<span id="an_595"></span> To every place where she hath supposed  
<span id="an_596"></span> By liklihede hir litel child to fynde;  
<span id="an_597"></span> And evere on Cristes mooder meeke and kynde  
<span id="an_598"></span> She cride, and atte laste thus she wroghte:  
<span id="an_599"></span> Among the cursed Jues she hym soghte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> She frayneth
and she preyeth pitously  
<span id="an_601"></span> To every Jew that dwelte in thilke place,  
<span id="an_602"></span> To telle hire if hir child wente oght forby.  
<span id="an_603"></span> They seyde "nay"; but Jhesu of his grace  
<span id="an_604"></span> Yaf in hir thoght inwith a litel space  
<span id="an_605"></span> That in that place after hir sone she cryde,  
<span id="an_606"></span> Where he was casten in a pit bisyde.  
<span id="an_607"></span> O grete God, that parfournest thy laude  
<span id="an_608"></span> By mouth of innocentz, lo, heere thy myght!  
<span id="an_609"></span> This gemme of chastite, this emeraude,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> And eek of
martirdom the ruby bright,  
<span id="an_611"></span> Ther he with throte ykorven lay upright,  
<span id="an_612"></span> He Alma redemptoris gan to synge  
<span id="an_613"></span> So loude that al the place gan to rynge.  
<span id="an_614"></span> The Cristene folk that thurgh the strete
wente  
<span id="an_615"></span> In coomen for to wondre upon this thyng,  
<span id="an_616"></span> And hastily they for the provost sente;  
<span id="an_617"></span> He cam anon withouten tariyng,  
<span id="an_618"></span> And herieth Crist that is of hevene kyng,  
<span id="an_619"></span> And eek his mooder, honour of mankynde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> And after
that the Jewes leet he bynde.  
<span id="an_621"></span> This child with pitous lamentacioun  
<span id="an_622"></span> Up taken was, syngynge his song alway,  
<span id="an_623"></span> And with honour of greet processioun  
<span id="an_624"></span> They carien hym unto the nexte abbay.  
<span id="an_625"></span> His mooder swownynge by his beere lay;  
<span id="an_626"></span> Unnethe myghte the peple that was theere  
<span id="an_627"></span> This newe Rachel brynge fro his beere.  
<span id="an_628"></span> With torment and with shameful deeth echon,  
<span id="an_629"></span> This provost dooth thise Jewes for to sterve  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> That of this
mordre wiste, and that anon.  
<span id="an_631"></span> He nolde no swich cursednesse observe.  
<span id="an_632"></span> "Yvele shal have that yvele wol deserve";  
<span id="an_633"></span> Therfore with wilde hors he dide hem drawe,  
<span id="an_634"></span> And after that he heng hem by the lawe.  
<span id="an_635"></span> Upon this beere ay lith this innocent  
<span id="an_636"></span> Biforn the chief auter, whil the masse
laste;  
<span id="an_637"></span> And after that, the abbot with his covent  
<span id="an_638"></span> Han sped hem for to burien hym ful faste;  
<span id="an_639"></span> And whan they hooly water on hym caste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> Yet spak this
child, whan spreynd was hooly water,  
<span id="an_641"></span> And song O Alma redemptoris mater!  
<span id="an_642"></span> This abbot, which that was an hooly man,  
<span id="an_643"></span> As monkes been -- or elles oghte be --  
<span id="an_644"></span> This yonge child to conjure he bigan,  
<span id="an_645"></span> And seyde, "O deere child, I halse thee,  
<span id="an_646"></span> In vertu of the hooly Trinitee,  
<span id="an_647"></span> Tel me what is thy cause for to synge,  
<span id="an_648"></span> Sith that thy throte is kut to my semynge?"  
<span id="an_649"></span> "My throte is kut unto my nekke boon,"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> Seyde this
child, "and as by wey of kynde  
<span id="an_651"></span> I sholde have dyed, ye, longe tyme agon.  
<span id="an_652"></span> But Jesu Crist, as ye in bookes fynde,  
<span id="an_653"></span> Wil that his glorie laste and be in mynde,  
<span id="an_654"></span> And for the worship of his Mooder deere  
<span id="an_655"></span> Yet may I synge O Alma loude and cleere.  
<span id="an_656"></span> "This welle of mercy, Cristes mooder sweete,  
<span id="an_657"></span> I loved alwey, as after my konnynge;  
<span id="an_658"></span> And whan that I my lyf sholde forlete,  
<span id="an_659"></span> To me she cam, and bad me for to synge  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> This anthem
verraily in my deyynge,  
<span id="an_661"></span> As ye han herd, and whan that I hadde songe,  
<span id="an_662"></span> Me thoughte she leyde a greyn upon my tonge.  
<span id="an_663"></span> "Wherfore I synge, and synge moot certeyn,  
<span id="an_664"></span> In honour of that blisful Mayden free  
<span id="an_665"></span> Til fro my tonge of taken is the greyn;  
<span id="an_666"></span> And after that thus seyde she to me:  
<span id="an_667"></span> \`My litel child, now wol I fecche thee,  
<span id="an_668"></span> Whan that the greyn is fro thy tonge ytake.  
<span id="an_669"></span> Be nat agast; I wol thee nat forsake.'"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> This hooly
monk, this abbot, hym meene I,  
<span id="an_671"></span> His tonge out caughte, and took awey the
greyn,  
<span id="an_672"></span> And he yaf up the goost ful softely.  
<span id="an_673"></span> And whan this abbot hadde this wonder seyn,  
<span id="an_674"></span> His salte teeris trikled doun as reyn,  
<span id="an_675"></span> And gruf he fil al plat upon the grounde,  
<span id="an_676"></span> And stille he lay as he had ben ybounde.  
<span id="an_677"></span> The covent eek lay on the pavement  
<span id="an_678"></span> Wepynge, and herying Cristes mooder deere,  
<span id="an_679"></span> And after that they ryse, and forth been
went,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> And tooken
awey this martir from his beere;  
<span id="an_681"></span> And in a tombe of marbul stones cleere  
<span id="an_682"></span> Enclosen they his litel body sweete.  
<span id="an_683"></span> Ther he is now, God leve us for to meete!  
<span id="an_684"></span> O yonge Hugh of Lyncoln, slayn also  
<span id="an_685"></span> With cursed Jewes, as it is notable,  
<span id="an_686"></span> For it is but a litel while ago,  
<span id="an_687"></span> Preye eek for us, we synful folk unstable,  
<span id="an_688"></span> That of his mercy God so merciable  
<span id="an_689"></span> On us his grete mercy multiplie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> For reverence
of his mooder Marie. Amen.
