#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Manciple's Tale

<span id="an_105"></span> Whan Phebus dwelled heere in this erthe
adoun,  
<span id="an_106"></span> As olde bookes maken mencioun,  
<span id="an_107"></span> He was the mooste lusty bachiler  
<span id="an_108"></span> In al this world, and eek the beste archer.  
<span id="an_109"></span> He slow Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Slepynge
agayn the sonne upon a day;  
<span id="an_111"></span> And many another noble worthy dede  
<span id="an_112"></span> He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede.  
<span id="an_113"></span> Pleyen he koude on every mynstralcie,  
<span id="an_114"></span> And syngen that it was a melodie  
<span id="an_115"></span> To heeren of his cleere voys the soun.  
<span id="an_116"></span> Certes the kyng of Thebes, Amphioun,  
<span id="an_117"></span> That with his syngyng walled that citee,  
<span id="an_118"></span> Koude nevere syngen half so wel as hee.  
<span id="an_119"></span> Therto he was the semelieste man  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> That is or
was sith that the world bigan.  
<span id="an_121"></span> What nedeth it his fetures to discryve?  
<span id="an_122"></span> For in this world was noon so faire on-lyve.  
<span id="an_123"></span> He was therwith fulfild of gentillesse,  
<span id="an_124"></span> Of honour, and of parfit worthynesse.  
<span id="an_125"></span> This Phebus, that was flour of bachilrie,  
<span id="an_126"></span> As wel in fredom as in chivalrie,  
<span id="an_127"></span> For his desport, in signe eek of victorie  
<span id="an_128"></span> Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,  
<span id="an_129"></span> Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Now hadde
this Phebus in his hous a crowe  
<span id="an_131"></span> Which in a cage he fostred many a day,  
<span id="an_132"></span> And taughte it speken, as men teche a jay.  
<span id="an_133"></span> Whit was this crowe as is a snow-whit swan,  
<span id="an_134"></span> And countrefete the speche of every man  
<span id="an_135"></span> He koude, whan he sholde telle a tale.  
<span id="an_136"></span> Therwith in al this world no nyghtyngale  
<span id="an_137"></span> Ne koude, by an hondred thousand deel,  
<span id="an_138"></span> Syngen so wonder myrily and weel.  
<span id="an_139"></span> Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a wyf  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Which that he
lovede moore than his lyf,  
<span id="an_141"></span> And nyght and day dide evere his diligence  
<span id="an_142"></span> Hir for to plese and doon hire reverence,  
<span id="an_143"></span> Save oonly, if the sothe that I shal sayn,  
<span id="an_144"></span> Jalous he was, and wolde have kept hire
fayn.  
<span id="an_145"></span> For hym were looth byjaped for to be,  
<span id="an_146"></span> And so is every wight in swich degree;  
<span id="an_147"></span> But al in ydel, for it availleth noght.  
<span id="an_148"></span> A good wyf, that is clene of werk and
thoght,  
<span id="an_149"></span> Sholde nat been kept in noon awayt, certayn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> And trewely
the labour is in vayn  
<span id="an_151"></span> To kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat bee.  
<span id="an_152"></span> This holde I for a verray nycetee,  
<span id="an_153"></span> To spille labour for to kepe wyves:  
<span id="an_154"></span> Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves.  
<span id="an_155"></span> But now to purpos, as I first bigan:  
<span id="an_156"></span> This worthy Phebus dooth al that he kan  
<span id="an_157"></span> To plesen hire, wenynge for swich plesaunce,  
<span id="an_158"></span> And for his manhede and his governaunce,  
<span id="an_159"></span> That no man sholde han put hym from hir
grace.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> But God it
woot, ther may no man embrace  
<span id="an_161"></span> As to destreyne a thyng which that nature  
<span id="an_162"></span> Hath natureelly set in a creature.  
<span id="an_163"></span> Taak any bryd, and put it in a cage,  
<span id="an_164"></span> And do al thyn entente and thy corage  
<span id="an_165"></span> To fostre it tendrely with mete and drynke  
<span id="an_166"></span> Of alle deyntees that thou kanst bithynke,  
<span id="an_167"></span> And keep it al so clenly as thou may,  
<span id="an_168"></span> Although his cage of gold be never so gay,  
<span id="an_169"></span> Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand
foold,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> Levere in a
forest that is rude and coold  
<span id="an_171"></span> Goon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse.  
<span id="an_172"></span> For evere this brid wol doon his bisynesse  
<span id="an_173"></span> To escape out of his cage, yif he may.  
<span id="an_174"></span> His libertee this brid desireth ay.  
<span id="an_175"></span> Lat take a cat, and fostre hym wel with milk  
<span id="an_176"></span> And tendre flessh, and make his couche of
silk,  
<span id="an_177"></span> And lat hym seen a mous go by the wal,  
<span id="an_178"></span> Anon he weyveth milk and flessh and al,  
<span id="an_179"></span> And every deyntee that is in that hous,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> Swich appetit
hath he to ete a mous.  
<span id="an_181"></span> Lo, heere hath lust his dominacioun,  
<span id="an_182"></span> And appetit fleemeth discrecioun.  
<span id="an_183"></span> A she-wolf hath also a vileyns kynde.  
<span id="an_184"></span> The lewedeste wolf that she may fynde,  
<span id="an_185"></span> Or leest of reputacioun, wol she take,  
<span id="an_186"></span> In tyme whan hir lust to han a make.  
<span id="an_187"></span> Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men  
<span id="an_188"></span> That been untrewe, and nothyng by wommen.  
<span id="an_189"></span> For men han evere a likerous appetit  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> On lower
thyng to parfourne hire delit  
<span id="an_191"></span> Than on hire wyves, be they never so faire,  
<span id="an_192"></span> Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire.  
<span id="an_193"></span> Flessh is so newefangel, with meschaunce,  
<span id="an_194"></span> That we ne konne in nothyng han plesaunce  
<span id="an_195"></span> That sowneth into vertu any while.  
<span id="an_196"></span> This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no
gile,  
<span id="an_197"></span> Deceyved was, for al his jolitee.  
<span id="an_198"></span> For under hym another hadde shee,  
<span id="an_199"></span> A man of litel reputacioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Nat worth to
Phebus in comparisoun.  
<span id="an_201"></span> The moore harm is, it happeth ofte so,  
<span id="an_202"></span> Of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo.  
<span id="an_203"></span> And so bifel, whan Phebus was absent,  
<span id="an_204"></span> His wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent.  
<span id="an_205"></span> Hir lemman? Certes, this is a knavyssh
speche!  
<span id="an_206"></span> Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseche.  
<span id="an_207"></span> The wise Plato seith, as ye may rede,  
<span id="an_208"></span> The word moot nede accorde with the dede.  
<span id="an_209"></span> If men shal telle proprely a thyng,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> The word moot
cosyn be to the werkyng.  
<span id="an_211"></span> I am a boystous man, right thus seye I:  
<span id="an_212"></span> Ther nys no difference, trewely,  
<span id="an_213"></span> Bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree,  
<span id="an_214"></span> If of hir body dishonest she bee,  
<span id="an_215"></span> And a povre wenche, oother than this --  
<span id="an_216"></span> If it so be they werke bothe amys --  
<span id="an_217"></span> But that the gentile, in estaat above,  
<span id="an_218"></span> She shal be cleped his lady, as in love;  
<span id="an_219"></span> And for that oother is a povre womman,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> She shal be
cleped his wenche or his lemman.  
<span id="an_221"></span> And, God it woot, myn owene deere brother,  
<span id="an_222"></span> Men leyn that oon as lowe as lith that
oother.  
<span id="an_223"></span> Right so bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt  
<span id="an_224"></span> And an outlawe or a theef erraunt,  
<span id="an_225"></span> The same I seye: ther is no difference.  
<span id="an_226"></span> To Alisaundre was toold this sentence,  
<span id="an_227"></span> That, for the tirant is of gretter myght  
<span id="an_228"></span> By force of meynee for to sleen dounright,  
<span id="an_229"></span> And brennen hous and hoom, and make al
playn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> Lo, therfore
is he cleped a capitayn;  
<span id="an_231"></span> And for the outlawe hath but smal meynee,  
<span id="an_232"></span> And may nat doon so greet an harm as he,  
<span id="an_233"></span> Ne brynge a contree to so greet mescheef,  
<span id="an_234"></span> Men clepen hym an outlawe or a theef.  
<span id="an_235"></span> But for I am a man noght textueel,  
<span id="an_236"></span> I wol noght telle of textes never a deel;  
<span id="an_237"></span> I wol go to my tale, as I bigan.  
<span id="an_238"></span> Whan Phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman,  
<span id="an_239"></span> Anon they wroghten al hire lust volage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> The white
crowe, that heeng ay in the cage,  
<span id="an_241"></span> Biheeld hire werk, and seyde never a word.  
<span id="an_242"></span> And whan that hoom was come Phebus, the
lord,  
<span id="an_243"></span> This crowe sang "Cokkow! Cokkow! Cokkow!"  
<span id="an_244"></span> "What, bryd?" quod Phebus. "What song
syngestow?  
<span id="an_245"></span> Ne were thow wont so myrily to synge  
<span id="an_246"></span> That to myn herte it was a rejoysynge  
<span id="an_247"></span> To heere thy voys? Allas, what song is
this?"  
<span id="an_248"></span> "By God," quod he, "I synge nat amys.  
<span id="an_249"></span> Phebus," quod he, "for al thy worthynesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> For al thy
beautee and thy gentilesse,  
<span id="an_251"></span> For al thy song and al thy mynstralcye,  
<span id="an_252"></span> For al thy waityng, blered is thyn ye  
<span id="an_253"></span> With oon of litel reputacioun,  
<span id="an_254"></span> Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun,  
<span id="an_255"></span> The montance of a gnat, so moote I thryve!  
<span id="an_256"></span> For on thy bed thy wyf I saugh hym swyve."  
<span id="an_257"></span> What wol ye moore? The crowe anon hym tolde,  
<span id="an_258"></span> By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde,  
<span id="an_259"></span> How that his wyf had doon hire lecherye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> Hym to greet
shame and to greet vileynye,  
<span id="an_261"></span> And tolde hym ofte he saugh it with his yen.  
<span id="an_262"></span> This Phebus gan aweyward for to wryen,  
<span id="an_263"></span> And thoughte his sorweful herte brast atwo.  
<span id="an_264"></span> His bowe he bente, and sette therinne a flo,  
<span id="an_265"></span> And in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn.  
<span id="an_266"></span> This is th' effect; ther is namoore to sayn;  
<span id="an_267"></span> For sorwe of which he brak his mynstralcie,  
<span id="an_268"></span> Bothe harpe, and lute, and gyterne, and
sautrie;  
<span id="an_269"></span> And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> And after
that thus spak he to the crowe:  
<span id="an_271"></span> "Traitour," quod he, "with tonge of
scorpioun,  
<span id="an_272"></span> Thou hast me broght to my confusioun;  
<span id="an_273"></span> Allas, that I was wroght! Why nere I deed?  
<span id="an_274"></span> O deere wyf! O gemme of lustiheed!  
<span id="an_275"></span> That were to me so sad and eek so trewe,  
<span id="an_276"></span> Now listow deed, with face pale of hewe,  
<span id="an_277"></span> Ful giltelees, that dorste I swere, ywys!  
<span id="an_278"></span> O rakel hand, to doon so foule amys!  
<span id="an_279"></span> O trouble wit, O ire recchelees,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> That unavysed
smyteth gilteles!  
<span id="an_281"></span> O wantrust, ful of fals suspecion,  
<span id="an_282"></span> Where was thy wit and thy discrecion?  
<span id="an_283"></span> O every man, be war of rakelnesse!  
<span id="an_284"></span> Ne trowe no thyng withouten strong witnesse.  
<span id="an_285"></span> Smyt nat to soone, er that ye witen why,  
<span id="an_286"></span> And beeth avysed wel and sobrely  
<span id="an_287"></span> Er ye doon any execucion  
<span id="an_288"></span> Upon youre ire for suspecion.  
<span id="an_289"></span> Allas, a thousand folk hath rakel ire  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> Fully
fordoon, and broght hem in the mire.  
<span id="an_291"></span> Allas! For sorwe I wol myselven slee!"  
<span id="an_292"></span> And to the crowe, "O false theef!" seyde he,  
<span id="an_293"></span> "I wol thee quite anon thy false tale.  
<span id="an_294"></span> Thou songe whilom lyk a nyghtyngale;  
<span id="an_295"></span> Now shaltow, false theef, thy song forgon,  
<span id="an_296"></span> And eek thy white fetheres everichon,  
<span id="an_297"></span> Ne nevere in al thy lif ne shaltou speke.  
<span id="an_298"></span> Thus shal men on a traytour been awreke;  
<span id="an_299"></span> Thou and thyn ofspryng evere shul be blake,

<span id="an_303"></span> And to the crowe he stirte, and that anon,  
<span id="an_304"></span> And pulled his white fetheres everychon,  
<span id="an_305"></span> And made hym blak, and refte hym al his

<span id="an_306"></span> And eek his speche, and out at dore hym

<span id="an_312"></span> How that another man hath dight his wyf;  
<span id="an_313"></span> He wol yow haten mortally, certeyn.  
<span id="an_314"></span> Daun Salomon, as wise clerkes seyn,  
<span id="an_315"></span> Techeth a man to kepen his tonge weel.  
<span id="an_316"></span> But, as I seyde, I am noght textueel.  
<span id="an_317"></span> But nathelees, thus taughte me my dame:  
<span id="an_318"></span> "My sone, thenk on the crowe, a Goddes name!  
<span id="an_319"></span> My sone, keep wel thy tonge, and keep thy
freend.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> A wikked
tonge is worse than a feend;  
<span id="an_321"></span> My sone, from a feend men may hem blesse.  
<span id="an_322"></span> My sone, God of his endelees goodnesse  
<span id="an_323"></span> Walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke,  
<span id="an_324"></span> For man sholde hym avyse what he speeke.  
<span id="an_325"></span> My sone, ful ofte, for to muche speche  
<span id="an_326"></span> Hath many a man been spilt, as clerkes
teche,  
<span id="an_327"></span> But for litel speche avysely  
<span id="an_328"></span> Is no man shent, to speke generally.  
<span id="an_329"></span> My sone, thy tonge sholdestow restreyne  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> At alle
tymes, but whan thou doost thy peyne  
<span id="an_331"></span> To speke of God, in honour and preyere.  
<span id="an_332"></span> The firste vertu, sone, if thou wolt leere,  
<span id="an_333"></span> Is to restreyne and kepe wel thy tonge;  
<span id="an_334"></span> Thus lerne children whan that they been
yonge.  
<span id="an_335"></span> My sone, of muchel spekyng yvele avysed,  
<span id="an_336"></span> Ther lasse spekyng hadde ynough suffised,  
<span id="an_337"></span> Comth muchel harm; thus was me toold and
taught.  
<span id="an_338"></span> In muchel speche synne wanteth naught.  
<span id="an_339"></span> Wostow wherof a rakel tonge serveth?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> Right as a
swerd forkutteth and forkerveth  
<span id="an_341"></span> An arm a-two, my deere sone, right so  
<span id="an_342"></span> A tonge kutteth freendshipe al a-two.  
<span id="an_343"></span> A jangler is to God abhomynable.  
<span id="an_344"></span> Reed Salomon, so wys and honurable;  
<span id="an_345"></span> Reed David in his psalmes; reed Senekke.  
<span id="an_346"></span> My sone, spek nat, but with thyn heed thou
bekke.  
<span id="an_347"></span> Dissimule as thou were deef, if that thou
heere  
<span id="an_348"></span> A janglere speke of perilous mateere.  
<span id="an_349"></span> The Flemyng seith, and lerne it if thee
leste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> That litel
janglyng causeth muchel reste.  
<span id="an_351"></span> My sone, if thou no wikked word hast seyd,  
<span id="an_352"></span> Thee thar nat drede for to be biwreyd;  
<span id="an_353"></span> But he that hath mysseyd, I dar wel sayn,  
<span id="an_354"></span> He may by no wey clepe his word agayn.  
<span id="an_355"></span> Thyng that is seyd is seyd, and forth it
gooth,  
<span id="an_356"></span> Though hym repente, or be hym nevere so
looth.  
<span id="an_357"></span> He is his thral to whom that he hath sayd  
<span id="an_358"></span> A tale of which he is now yvele apayd.  
<span id="an_359"></span> My sone, be war, and be noon auctour newe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> Of tidynges,
wheither they been false or trewe.  
<span id="an_361"></span> Whereso thou come, amonges hye or lowe,  
<span id="an_362"></span> Kepe wel thy tonge and thenk upon the
crowe."
