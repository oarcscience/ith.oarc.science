#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Reeve's Tale

<span id="an_3921"></span> At Trumpyngtoun, nat fer fro Cantebrigge,  
<span id="an_3922"></span> Ther gooth a brook, and over that a brigge,  
<span id="an_3923"></span> Upon the whiche brook ther stant a melle;  
<span id="an_3924"></span> And this is verray sooth that I yow telle:  
<span id="an_3925"></span> A millere was ther dwellynge many a day.  
<span id="an_3926"></span> As any pecok he was proud and gay.  
<span id="an_3927"></span> Pipen he koude and fisshe, and nettes
beete,  
<span id="an_3928"></span> And turne coppes, and wel wrastle and
sheete;  
<span id="an_3929"></span> Ay by his belt he baar a long panade,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3930">3930</span></span> And of a
swerd ful trenchant was the blade.  
<span id="an_3931"></span> A joly poppere baar he in his pouche;  
<span id="an_3932"></span> Ther was no man, for peril, dorste hym
touche.  
<span id="an_3933"></span> A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose.  
<span id="an_3934"></span> Round was his face, and camus was his nose;  
<span id="an_3935"></span> As piled as an ape was his skulle.  
<span id="an_3936"></span> He was a market-betere atte fulle.  
<span id="an_3937"></span> Ther dorste no wight hand upon hym legge,  
<span id="an_3938"></span> That he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge.  
<span id="an_3939"></span> A theef he was for sothe of corn and mele,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3940">3940</span></span> And that a
sly, and usaunt for to stele.  
<span id="an_3941"></span> His name was hoote deynous Symkyn.  
<span id="an_3942"></span> A wyf he hadde, ycomen of noble kyn;  
<span id="an_3943"></span> The person of the toun hir fader was.  
<span id="an_3944"></span> With hire he yaf ful many a panne of bras,  
<span id="an_3945"></span> For that Symkyn sholde in his blood allye.  
<span id="an_3946"></span> She was yfostred in a nonnerye;  
<span id="an_3947"></span> For Symkyn wolde no wyf, as he sayde,  
<span id="an_3948"></span> But she were wel ynorissed and a mayde,  
<span id="an_3949"></span> To saven his estaat of yomanrye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3950">3950</span></span> And she was
proud, and peert as is a pye.  
<span id="an_3951"></span> A ful fair sighte was it upon hem two;  
<span id="an_3952"></span> On halydayes biforn hire wolde he go  
<span id="an_3953"></span> With his typet wounde aboute his heed,  
<span id="an_3954"></span> And she cam after in a gyte of reed;  
<span id="an_3955"></span> And Symkyn hadde hosen of the same.  
<span id="an_3956"></span> Ther dorste no wight clepen hire but
"dame";  
<span id="an_3957"></span> Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye  
<span id="an_3958"></span> That with hire dorste rage or ones pleye,  
<span id="an_3959"></span> But if he wolde be slayn of Symkyn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3960">3960</span></span> With
panade, or with knyf, or boidekyn.  
<span id="an_3961"></span> For jalous folk ben perilous everemo --  
<span id="an_3962"></span> Algate they wolde hire wyves wenden so.  
<span id="an_3963"></span> And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,  
<span id="an_3964"></span> She was as digne as water in a dich,  
<span id="an_3965"></span> And ful of hoker and of bisemare.  
<span id="an_3966"></span> Hir thoughte that a lady sholde hire spare,  
<span id="an_3967"></span> What for hire kynrede and hir nortelrie  
<span id="an_3968"></span> That she hadde lerned in the nonnerie.  
<span id="an_3969"></span> A doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3970">3970</span></span> Of twenty
yeer, withouten any mo,  
<span id="an_3971"></span> Savynge a child that was of half yeer age;  
<span id="an_3972"></span> In cradel it lay and was a propre page.  
<span id="an_3973"></span> This wenche thikke and wel ygrowen was,  
<span id="an_3974"></span> With kamus nose and eyen greye as glas,  
<span id="an_3975"></span> With buttokes brode and brestes rounde and
hye.  
<span id="an_3976"></span> But right fair was hire heer; I wol nat
lye.  
<span id="an_3977"></span> This person of the toun, for she was feir,  
<span id="an_3978"></span> In purpos was to maken hire his heir,  
<span id="an_3979"></span> Bothe of his catel and his mesuage,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3980">3980</span></span> And
straunge he made it of hir mariage.  
<span id="an_3981"></span> His purpos was for to bistowe hire hye  
<span id="an_3982"></span> Into som worthy blood of auncetrye;  
<span id="an_3983"></span> For hooly chirches good moot been despended  
<span id="an_3984"></span> On hooly chirches blood, that is descended.  
<span id="an_3985"></span> Therfore he wolde his hooly blood honoure,  
<span id="an_3986"></span> Though that he hooly chirche sholde
devoure.  
<span id="an_3987"></span> Greet sokene hath this millere, out of
doute,  
<span id="an_3988"></span> With whete and malt of al the land aboute;  
<span id="an_3989"></span> And nameliche ther was a greet collegge  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3990">3990</span></span> Men clepen
the Soler Halle at Cantebregge;  
<span id="an_3991"></span> Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt
ygrounde.  
<span id="an_3992"></span> And on a day it happed, in a stounde,  
<span id="an_3993"></span> Sik lay the maunciple on a maladye;  
<span id="an_3994"></span> Men wenden wisly that he sholde dye.  
<span id="an_3995"></span> For which this millere stal bothe mele and
corn  
<span id="an_3996"></span> An hundred tyme moore than biforn;  
<span id="an_3997"></span> For therbiforn he stal but curteisly,  
<span id="an_3998"></span> But now he was a theef outrageously,  
<span id="an_3999"></span> For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4000">4000</span></span> But therof
sette the millere nat a tare;  
<span id="an_4001"></span> He craketh boost, and swoor it was nat so.  
<span id="an_4002"></span> Thanne were ther yonge povre scolers two,  
<span id="an_4003"></span> That dwelten in this halle, of which I
seye.  
<span id="an_4004"></span> Testif they were, and lusty for to pleye,  
<span id="an_4005"></span> And, oonly for hire myrthe and revelrye,  
<span id="an_4006"></span> Upon the wardeyn bisily they crye  
<span id="an_4007"></span> To yeve hem leve, but a litel stounde,  
<span id="an_4008"></span> To goon to mille and seen hir corn
ygrounde;  
<span id="an_4009"></span> And hardily they dorste leye hir nekke  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4010">4010</span></span> The millere
sholde not stele hem half a pekke  
<span id="an_4011"></span> Of corn by sleighte, ne by force hem reve;  
<span id="an_4012"></span> And at the laste the wardeyn yaf hem leve.  
<span id="an_4013"></span> John highte that oon, and Aleyn highte that
oother;  
<span id="an_4014"></span> Of o toun were they born, that highte
Strother,  
<span id="an_4015"></span> Fer in the north; I kan nat telle where.  
<span id="an_4016"></span> This Aleyn maketh redy al his gere,  
<span id="an_4017"></span> And on an hors the sak he caste anon.  
<span id="an_4018"></span> Forth goth Aleyn the clerk, and also John,  
<span id="an_4019"></span> With good swerd and with bokeler by hir
syde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4020">4020</span></span> John knew
the wey -- hem nedede no gyde --  
<span id="an_4021"></span> And at the mille the sak adoun he layth.  
<span id="an_4022"></span> Aleyn spak first: "Al hayl, Symond,
y-fayth!  
<span id="an_4023"></span> Hou fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf?"  
<span id="an_4024"></span> "Aleyn, welcome," quod Symkyn, "by my lyf!  
<span id="an_4025"></span> And John also, how now, what do ye heer?"  
<span id="an_4026"></span> "Symond," quod John, "by God, nede has na
peer.  
<span id="an_4027"></span> Hym boes serve hymself that has na swayn,  
<span id="an_4028"></span> Or elles he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.  
<span id="an_4029"></span> Oure manciple, I hope he wil be deed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4030">4030</span></span> Swa werkes
ay the wanges in his heed;  
<span id="an_4031"></span> And forthy is I come, and eek Alayn,  
<span id="an_4032"></span> To grynde oure corn and carie it ham agayn;  
<span id="an_4033"></span> I pray yow spede us heythen that ye may."  
<span id="an_4034"></span> "It shal be doon," quod Symkyn, "by my fay!  
<span id="an_4035"></span> What wol ye doon whil that it is in hande?"  
<span id="an_4036"></span> "By God, right by the hopur wil I stande,"  
<span id="an_4037"></span> Quod John, "and se howgates the corn gas
in.  
<span id="an_4038"></span> Yet saugh I nevere, by my fader kyn,  
<span id="an_4039"></span> How that the hopur wagges til and fra."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4040">4040</span></span> Aleyn
answerde, "John, and wiltow swa?  
<span id="an_4041"></span> Thanne wil I be bynethe, by my croun,  
<span id="an_4042"></span> And se how that the mele falles doun  
<span id="an_4043"></span> Into the trough; that sal be my disport.  
<span id="an_4044"></span> For John, y-faith, I may been of youre
sort;  
<span id="an_4045"></span> I is as ille a millere as ar ye."  
<span id="an_4046"></span> This millere smyled of hir nycetee,  
<span id="an_4047"></span> And thoghte, "Al this nys doon but for a
wyle.  
<span id="an_4048"></span> They wene that no man may hem bigyle,  
<span id="an_4049"></span> But by my thrift, yet shal I blere hir ye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4050">4050</span></span> For al the
sleighte in hir philosophye.  
<span id="an_4051"></span> The moore queynte crekes that they make,  
<span id="an_4052"></span> The moore wol I stele whan I take.  
<span id="an_4053"></span> In stide of flour yet wol I yeve hem bren.  
<span id="an_4054"></span> \`The gretteste clerkes been noght wisest
men,'  
<span id="an_4055"></span> As whilom to the wolf thus spak the mare.  
<span id="an_4056"></span> Of al hir art counte I noght a tare."  
<span id="an_4057"></span> Out at the dore he gooth ful pryvely,  
<span id="an_4058"></span> Whan that he saugh his tyme, softely.  
<span id="an_4059"></span> He looketh up and doun til he hath founde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4060">4060</span></span> The clerkes
hors, ther as it stood ybounde  
<span id="an_4061"></span> Bihynde the mille, under a levesel;  
<span id="an_4062"></span> And to the hors he goth hym faire and wel;  
<span id="an_4063"></span> He strepeth of the brydel right anon.  
<span id="an_4064"></span> And whan the hors was laus, he gynneth gon  
<span id="an_4065"></span> Toward the fen, ther wilde mares renne,  
<span id="an_4066"></span> And forth with "wehee," thurgh thikke and
thurgh thenne.  
<span id="an_4067"></span> This millere gooth agayn, no word he seyde,  
<span id="an_4068"></span> But dooth his note, and with the clerkes
pleyde  
<span id="an_4069"></span> Til that hir corn was faire and weel
ygrounde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4070">4070</span></span> And whan
the mele is sakked and ybounde,  
<span id="an_4071"></span> This John goth out and fynt his hors away,  
<span id="an_4072"></span> And gan to crie "Harrow!" and "Weylaway!  
<span id="an_4073"></span> Oure hors is lorn, Alayn, for Goddes banes,  
<span id="an_4074"></span> Step on thy feet! Com of, man, al atanes!  
<span id="an_4075"></span> Allas, our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn."  
<span id="an_4076"></span> This Aleyn al forgat, bothe mele and corn;  
<span id="an_4077"></span> Al was out of his mynde his housbondrie.  
<span id="an_4078"></span> "What, whilk way is he geen?" he gan to
crie.  
<span id="an_4079"></span> The wyf cam lepynge inward with a ren.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4080">4080</span></span> She seyde,
"Allas! youre hors goth to the fen  
<span id="an_4081"></span> With wilde mares, as faste as he may go.  
<span id="an_4082"></span> Unthank come on his hand that boond hym so,  
<span id="an_4083"></span> And he that bettre sholde han knyt the
reyne!"  
<span id="an_4084"></span> "Allas," quod John, "Aleyn, for Cristes
peyne  
<span id="an_4085"></span> Lay doun thy swerd, and I wil myn alswa.  
<span id="an_4086"></span> I is ful wight, God waat, as is a raa;  
<span id="an_4087"></span> By Goddes herte, he sal nat scape us bathe!  
<span id="an_4088"></span> Why ne had thow pit the capul in the lathe?  
<span id="an_4089"></span> Ilhayl! By God, Alayn, thou is a fonne!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4090">4090</span></span> Thise sely
clerkes han ful faste yronne  
<span id="an_4091"></span> Toward the fen, bothe Aleyn and eek John.  
<span id="an_4092"></span> And whan the millere saugh that they were
gon,  
<span id="an_4093"></span> He half a busshel of hir flour hath take,  
<span id="an_4094"></span> And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake.  
<span id="an_4095"></span> He seyde, "I trowe the clerkes were aferd.  
<span id="an_4096"></span> Yet kan a millere make a clerkes berd,  
<span id="an_4097"></span> For al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye!  
<span id="an_4098"></span> Lo, wher he gooth! Ye, lat the children
pleye.  
<span id="an_4099"></span> They gete hym nat so lightly, by my croun."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4100">4100</span></span> Thise sely
clerkes rennen up and doun  
<span id="an_4101"></span> With "Keep! Keep! Stand! Stand! Jossa,
warderere,  
<span id="an_4102"></span> Ga whistle thou, and I shal kepe hym
heere!"  
<span id="an_4103"></span> But shortly, til that it was verray nyght,  
<span id="an_4104"></span> They koude nat, though they dide al hir
myght,  
<span id="an_4105"></span> Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste,  
<span id="an_4106"></span> Til in a dych they caughte hym atte laste.  
<span id="an_4107"></span> Wery and weet, as beest is in the reyn,  
<span id="an_4108"></span> Comth sely John, and with him comth Aleyn.  
<span id="an_4109"></span> "Allas," quod John, "the day that I was
born!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4110">4110</span></span> Now are we
dryve til hethyng and til scorn.  
<span id="an_4111"></span> Oure corn is stoln; men wil us fooles
calle,  
<span id="an_4112"></span> Bathe the wardeyn and oure felawes alle,  
<span id="an_4113"></span> And namely the millere, weylaway!"  
<span id="an_4114"></span> Thus pleyneth John as he gooth by the way  
<span id="an_4115"></span> Toward the mille, and Bayard in his hond.  
<span id="an_4116"></span> The millere sittynge by the fyr he fond,  
<span id="an_4117"></span> For it was nyght, and forther myghte they
noght;  
<span id="an_4118"></span> But for the love of God they hym bisoght  
<span id="an_4119"></span> Of herberwe and of ese, as for hir peny.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4120">4120</span></span> The millere
seyde agayn, "If ther be eny,  
<span id="an_4121"></span> Swich as it is, yet shal ye have youre
part.  
<span id="an_4122"></span> Myn hous is streit, but ye han lerned art;  
<span id="an_4123"></span> Ye konne by argumentes make a place  
<span id="an_4124"></span> A myle brood of twenty foot of space.  
<span id="an_4125"></span> Lat se now if this place may suffise,  
<span id="an_4126"></span> Or make it rowm with speche, as is youre
gise."  
<span id="an_4127"></span> "Now, Symond," seyde John, "by Seint
Cutberd,  
<span id="an_4128"></span> Ay is thou myrie, and this is faire
answerd.  
<span id="an_4129"></span> I have herd seyd, \`Man sal taa of twa

<span id="an_4131"></span> But specially I pray thee, hooste deere,  
<span id="an_4132"></span> Get us som mete and drynke, and make us
cheere,  
<span id="an_4133"></span> And we wil payen trewely atte fulle.  
<span id="an_4134"></span> With empty hand men may na haukes tulle;  
<span id="an_4135"></span> Loo, heere oure silver, redy for to

<span id="an_4136"></span> This millere into toun his doghter sende  
<span id="an_4137"></span> For ale and breed, and rosted hem a goos,  
<span id="an_4138"></span> And boond hire hors, it sholde namoore go
loos,  
<span id="an_4139"></span> And in his owene chambre hem made a bed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4140">4140</span></span> With
sheetes and with chalons faire yspred  
<span id="an_4141"></span> Noght from his owene bed ten foot or
twelve.  
<span id="an_4142"></span> His doghter hadde a bed, al by hirselve,  
<span id="an_4143"></span> Right in the same chambre by and by.  
<span id="an_4144"></span> It myghte be no bet, and cause why?  
<span id="an_4145"></span> Ther was no roumer herberwe in the place.  
<span id="an_4146"></span> They soupen and they speke, hem to solace,  
<span id="an_4147"></span> And drynken evere strong ale atte beste.  
<span id="an_4148"></span> Aboute mydnyght wente they to reste.  
<span id="an_4149"></span> Wel hath this millere vernysshed his heed;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4150">4150</span></span> Ful pale he
was for dronken, and nat reed.  
<span id="an_4151"></span> He yexeth, and he speketh thurgh the nose  
<span id="an_4152"></span> As he were on the quakke, or on the pose.  
<span id="an_4153"></span> To bedde he goth, and with hym goth his
wyf.  
<span id="an_4154"></span> As any jay she light was and jolyf,  
<span id="an_4155"></span> So was hir joly whistle wel ywet.  
<span id="an_4156"></span> The cradel at hir beddes feet is set,  
<span id="an_4157"></span> To rokken, and to yeve the child to sowke.  
<span id="an_4158"></span> And whan that dronken al was in the crowke,  
<span id="an_4159"></span> To bedde wente the doghter right anon;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4160">4160</span></span> To bedde
goth Aleyn and also John;  
<span id="an_4161"></span> Ther nas na moore -- hem nedede no dwale.  
<span id="an_4162"></span> This millere hath so wisely bibbed ale  
<span id="an_4163"></span> That as an hors he fnorteth in his sleep,  
<span id="an_4164"></span> Ne of his tayl bihynde he took no keep.  
<span id="an_4165"></span> His wyf bar hym a burdon, a ful strong;  
<span id="an_4166"></span> Men myghte hir rowtyng heere two furlong;  
<span id="an_4167"></span> The wenche rowteth eek, par compaignye.  
<span id="an_4168"></span> Aleyn the clerk, that herde this melodye,  
<span id="an_4169"></span> He poked John, and seyde, "Slepestow?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4170">4170</span></span> Herdestow

<span id="an_4171"></span> Lo, swilk a complyn is ymel hem alle;

<span id="an_4176"></span> But yet, na fors, al sal be for the beste.  
<span id="an_4177"></span> For, John," seyde he, "als evere moot I

<span id="an_4178"></span> If that I may, yon wenche wil I swyve.  
<span id="an_4179"></span> Som esement has lawe yshapen us,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4180">4180</span></span> For, John,
ther is a lawe that says thus:  
<span id="an_4181"></span> That gif a man in a point be agreved,  
<span id="an_4182"></span> That in another he sal be releved.  
<span id="an_4183"></span> Oure corn is stoln, sothly, it is na nay,  
<span id="an_4184"></span> And we han had an il fit al this day;  
<span id="an_4185"></span> And syn I sal have neen amendement  
<span id="an_4186"></span> Agayn my los, I will have esement.  
<span id="an_4187"></span> By Goddes sale, it sal neen other bee!"  
<span id="an_4188"></span> This John answerde, "Alayn, avyse thee!  
<span id="an_4189"></span> The millere is a perilous man," he seyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4190">4190</span></span> "And gif

<span id="an_4192"></span> Aleyn answerde, "I counte hym nat a flye."  
<span id="an_4193"></span> And up he rist, and by the wenche he
crepte.  
<span id="an_4194"></span> This wenche lay uprighte and faste slepte,  
<span id="an_4195"></span> Til he so ny was, er she myghte espie,  
<span id="an_4196"></span> That it had been to late for to crie,  
<span id="an_4197"></span> And shortly for to seyn, they were aton.  
<span id="an_4198"></span> Now pley, Aleyn, for I wol speke of John.  
<span id="an_4199"></span> This John lith stille a furlong wey or two,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4200">4200</span></span> And to

<span id="an_4203"></span> Yet has my felawe somwhat for his harm;  
<span id="an_4204"></span> He has the milleris doghter in his arm.  
<span id="an_4205"></span> He auntred hym, and has his nedes sped,  
<span id="an_4206"></span> And I lye as a draf-sak in my bed;
