#### The Shorter Poems

### An ABC

<span id="an_1"></span> Almighty and al merciable queene,  
<span id="an_2"></span> To whom that al this world fleeth for socour,  
<span id="an_3"></span> To have relees of sinne, of sorwe, and teene,  
<span id="an_4"></span> Glorious virgine, of alle floures flour,  
<span id="an_5"></span> To thee I flee, confounded in errour.  
<span id="an_6"></span> Help and releeve, thou mighti debonayre,  
<span id="an_7"></span> Have mercy on my perilous langour.  
<span id="an_8"></span> Venquisshed me hath my cruel adversaire.  
<span id="an_9"></span> Bountee so fix hath in thin herte his tente  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> That wel I wot
thou wolt my socour bee;  
<span id="an_11"></span> Thou canst not warne him that with good
entente  
<span id="an_12"></span> Axeth thin helpe, thin herte is ay so free.  
<span id="an_13"></span> Thou art largesse of pleyn felicitee,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Haven of refut, of quiete, and of reste.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Loo, how that theeves sevene chasen mee.  
<span id="an_16"></span> Help, lady bright, er that my ship tobreste.  
<span id="an_17"></span> Comfort is noon but in yow, ladi deere;  
<span id="an_18"></span> For loo, my sinne and my confusioun,  
<span id="an_19"></span> Which oughten not in thi presence appeere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> Han take on me
a greevous accioun  
<span id="an_21"></span> Of verrey right and desperacioun;  
<span id="an_22"></span> And as bi right thei mighten wel susteene  
<span id="an_23"></span> That I were wurthi my dampnacioun,  
<span id="an_24"></span> Nere merci of you, blisful hevene queene.  
<span id="an_25"></span> Dowte is ther noon, thou queen of
misericorde,  
<span id="an_26"></span> That thou n' art cause of grace and merci
heere;  
<span id="an_27"></span> God vouched sauf thurgh thee with us to
accorde.  
<span id="an_28"></span> For certes, Crystes blisful mooder deere,  
<span id="an_29"></span> Were now the bowe bent in swich maneere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> As it was first
of justice and of ire,  
<span id="an_31"></span> The rightful God nolde of no mercy heere;  
<span id="an_32"></span> But thurgh thee han we grace as we desire.  
<span id="an_33"></span> Evere hath myn hope of refut been in thee,  
<span id="an_34"></span> For heer-biforn ful ofte in many a wyse  
<span id="an_35"></span> Hast thou to misericorde receyved me.  
<span id="an_36"></span> But merci, ladi, at the grete assyse  
<span id="an_37"></span> Whan we shule come bifore the hye justyse.  
<span id="an_38"></span> So litel fruit shal thanne in me be founde  
<span id="an_39"></span> That, but thou er that day correcte \[vice\],  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> Of verrey right
my werk wol me confounde.  
<span id="an_41"></span> Fleeinge, I flee for socour to thi tente  
<span id="an_42"></span> Me for to hide from tempeste ful of dreede,  
<span id="an_43"></span> Biseeching yow that ye you not absente  
<span id="an_44"></span> Thouh I be wikke. O, help yit at this neede!  
<span id="an_45"></span> Al have I ben a beste in wil and deede,  
<span id="an_46"></span> Yit, ladi, thou me cloth. with thi grace.  
<span id="an_47"></span> Thin enemy and myn -- ladi, tak heede --  
<span id="an_48"></span> Unto my deth in poynt is me to chace!  
<span id="an_49"></span> Glorious mayde and mooder, which that nevere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> Were bitter,
neither in erthe nor in see,  
<span id="an_51"></span> But ful of swetnesse and of merci evere,  
<span id="an_52"></span> Help that my Fader be not wroth with me.  
<span id="an_53"></span> Spek thou, for I ne dar not him ysee,  
<span id="an_54"></span> So have I doon in erthe, allas the while,  
<span id="an_55"></span> That certes, but if thou my socour bee,  
<span id="an_56"></span> To stink eterne he wole my gost exile.  
<span id="an_57"></span> He vouched sauf, tel him, as was his wille,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Bicome a man, to have oure alliaunce,  
<span id="an_59"></span> And with his precious blood he wrot the bille  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Upon the crois
as general acquitaunce  
<span id="an_61"></span> To every penitent in ful creaunce;  
<span id="an_62"></span> And therfore, ladi bright, thou for us praye.  
<span id="an_63"></span> Thanne shalt thou bothe stinte al his
grevaunce,  
<span id="an_64"></span> And make oure foo to failen of his praye.  
<span id="an_65"></span> I wot it wel, thou wolt ben oure socour,  
<span id="an_66"></span> Thou art so ful of bowntee, in certeyn,  
<span id="an_67"></span> For whan a soule falleth in errour  
<span id="an_68"></span> Thi pitee goth and haleth him ayein.  
<span id="an_69"></span> Thanne makest thou his pees with his sovereyn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> And bringest
him out of the crooked strete.  
<span id="an_71"></span> Whoso thee loveth, he shal not love in veyn,  
<span id="an_72"></span> That shal he fynde as he the lyf shal lete.  
<span id="an_73"></span> Kalenderes enlumyned ben thei  
<span id="an_74"></span> That in this world ben lighted with thi name,  
<span id="an_75"></span> And whoso goth to yow the righte wey,  
<span id="an_76"></span> Him thar not drede in soule to be lame.  
<span id="an_77"></span> Now, queen of comfort, sith thou art that

<span id="an_78"></span> To whom I seeche for my medicyne,  
<span id="an_79"></span> Lat not my foo no more my wounde entame;

<span id="an_81"></span> Ladi, thi sorwe kan I not portreye

<span id="an_83"></span> But for youre bothes peynes I yow preye,  
<span id="an_84"></span> Lat not oure alder foo make his bobaunce  
<span id="an_85"></span> That he hath in his lystes of mischaunce  
<span id="an_86"></span> Convict that ye bothe have bought so deere.  
<span id="an_87"></span> As I seide erst, thou ground of oure
substaunce,  
<span id="an_88"></span> Continue on us thi pitous eyen cleere!  
<span id="an_89"></span> Moises, that saugh the bush with flawmes rede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Brenninge, of

<span id="an_91"></span> Was signe of thin unwemmed maidenhede.  
<span id="an_92"></span> Thou art the bush on which ther gan descende  
<span id="an_93"></span> The Holi Gost, the which that Moyses wende  
<span id="an_94"></span> Had ben a-fyr, and this was in figure.  
<span id="an_95"></span> Now, ladi, from the fyr thou us defende  
<span id="an_96"></span> Which that in helle eternalli shal dure.  
<span id="an_97"></span> Noble princesse, that nevere haddest peere,  
<span id="an_98"></span> Certes if any comfort in us bee,  
<span id="an_99"></span> That cometh of thee, thou Cristes mooder
deere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> We han noon

<span id="an_101"></span> Us to rejoyse in oure adversitee,  
<span id="an_102"></span> Ne advocat noon that wole and dar so preye  
<span id="an_103"></span> For us, and that for litel hire as yee  
<span id="an_104"></span> That helpen for an Ave-Marie or tweye.  
<span id="an_105"></span> O verrey light of eyen that ben blynde,  
<span id="an_106"></span> O verrey lust of labour and distresse,  
<span id="an_107"></span> O tresoreere of bountee to mankynde,  
<span id="an_108"></span> Thee whom God ches to mooder for humblesse!  
<span id="an_109"></span> From his ancille he made the maistresse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Of hevene and
erthe, oure bille up for to beede.  
<span id="an_111"></span> This world awaiteth evere on thi goodnesse  
<span id="an_112"></span> For thou ne failest nevere wight at neede.  
<span id="an_113"></span> Purpos I have sum time for to enquere  
<span id="an_114"></span> Wherfore and whi the Holi Gost thee soughte  
<span id="an_115"></span> Whan Gabrielles vois cam to thin ere.  
<span id="an_116"></span> He not to werre us swich a wonder wroughte,  
<span id="an_117"></span> But for to save us that he sithen boughte.  
<span id="an_118"></span> Thanne needeth us no wepen us for to save,

<span id="an_124"></span> Allas, I caityf, whider may I flee?  
<span id="an_125"></span> Who shal unto thi Sone my mene bee?  
<span id="an_126"></span> Who, but thiself, that art of pitee welle?  
<span id="an_127"></span> Thou hast more reuthe on oure adversitee  
<span id="an_128"></span> Than in this world might any tonge telle.  
<span id="an_129"></span> Redresse me, mooder, and me chastise,

<span id="an_132"></span> So hidous is his rightful rekenynge.  
<span id="an_133"></span> Mooder, of whom oure merci gan to springe,  
<span id="an_134"></span> Beth ye my juge and eek my soules leche;  
<span id="an_135"></span> For evere in you is pitee haboundinge  
<span id="an_136"></span> To ech that wole of pitee you biseeche.  
<span id="an_137"></span> Soth is that God ne granteth no pitee  
<span id="an_138"></span> Withoute thee; for God of his goodnesse  
<span id="an_139"></span> Foryiveth noon, but it like unto thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> He hath thee

<span id="an_141"></span> Of al this world, and eek governouresse  
<span id="an_142"></span> Of hevene, and he represseth his justise  
<span id="an_143"></span> After thi wil; and therfore in witnesse  
<span id="an_144"></span> He hath thee corowned in so rial wise.  
<span id="an_145"></span> Temple devout, ther God hath his woninge,  
<span id="an_146"></span> Fro which these misbileeved deprived been,

<span id="an_148"></span> Receyve me -- I can no ferther fleen.  
<span id="an_149"></span> With thornes venymous, O hevene queen,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> For which the
eerthe acursed was ful yore,  
<span id="an_151"></span> I am so wounded, as ye may wel seen,  
<span id="an_152"></span> That I am lost almost, it smert so sore.  
<span id="an_153"></span> Virgine, that art so noble of apparaile,  
<span id="an_154"></span> And ledest us into the hye tour  
<span id="an_155"></span> Of Paradys, thou me wisse and counsaile  
<span id="an_156"></span> How I may have thi grace and thi socour,  
<span id="an_157"></span> All have I ben in filthe and in errour.  
<span id="an_158"></span> Ladi, unto that court thou me ajourne  
<span id="an_159"></span> That cleped is thi bench, O freshe flour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> Ther as that

<span id="an_161"></span> Xristus, thi sone, that in this world
alighte  
<span id="an_162"></span> Upon the cros to suffre his passioun,  
<span id="an_163"></span> And eek that Longius his herte pighte  
<span id="an_164"></span> And made his herte blood to renne adoun,  
<span id="an_165"></span> And al was this for my salvacioun;  
<span id="an_166"></span> And I to him am fals and eek unkynde,  
<span id="an_167"></span> And yit he wole not my dampnacioun --  
<span id="an_168"></span> This thanke I yow, socour of al mankynde!  
<span id="an_169"></span> Ysaac was figure of his deth, certeyn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> That so fer
forth his fader wolde obeye  
<span id="an_171"></span> That him ne roughte nothing to be slayn;  
<span id="an_172"></span> Right soo thi Sone list as a lamb to deye.  
<span id="an_173"></span> Now, ladi ful of merci, I yow preye,  
<span id="an_174"></span> Sith he his merci mesured so large,  
<span id="an_175"></span> Be ye not skant, for alle we singe and seye  
<span id="an_176"></span> That ye ben from vengeaunce ay oure targe.  
<span id="an_177"></span> Zacharie yow clepeth the open welle  
<span id="an_178"></span> To wasshe sinful soule out of his gilt.  
<span id="an_179"></span> Therfore this lessoun oughte I wel to telle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> That, nere
thi tender herte, we were spilt.  
<span id="an_181"></span> Now, ladi bryghte, sith thou canst and wilt  
<span id="an_182"></span> Ben to the seed of Adam merciable,  
<span id="an_183"></span> Bring us to that palais that is bilt  
<span id="an_184"></span> To penitentes that ben to merci able. Amen.
