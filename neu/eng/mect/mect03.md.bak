#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Miller's Tale

<span id="an_3187"></span> Whilom ther was dwellynge at Oxenford  
<span id="an_3188"></span> A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,  
<span id="an_3189"></span> And of his craft he was a carpenter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3190">3190</span></span> With hym
ther was dwellynge a poure scoler,  
<span id="an_3191"></span> Hadde lerned art, but al his fantasye  
<span id="an_3192"></span> Was turned for to lerne astrologye,  
<span id="an_3193"></span> And koude a certeyn of conclusiouns,  
<span id="an_3194"></span> To demen by interrogaciouns,  
<span id="an_3195"></span> If that men asked hym, in certein houres  
<span id="an_3196"></span> Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles
shoures,  
<span id="an_3197"></span> Or if men asked hym what sholde bifalle  
<span id="an_3198"></span> Of every thyng; I may nat rekene hem alle.  
<span id="an_3199"></span> This clerk was cleped hende Nicholas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3200">3200</span></span> Of deerne
love he koude and of solas;  
<span id="an_3201"></span> And therto he was sleigh and ful privee,  
<span id="an_3202"></span> And lyk a mayden meke for to see.  
<span id="an_3203"></span> A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye  
<span id="an_3204"></span> Allone, withouten any compaignye,  
<span id="an_3205"></span> Ful fetisly ydight with herbes swoote;  
<span id="an_3206"></span> And he hymself as sweete as is the roote  
<span id="an_3207"></span> Of lycorys or any cetewale.  
<span id="an_3208"></span> His Almageste, and bookes grete and smale,  
<span id="an_3209"></span> His astrelabie, longynge for his art,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3210">3210</span></span> His augrym
stones layen faire apart,  
<span id="an_3211"></span> On shelves couched at his beddes heed;  
<span id="an_3212"></span> His presse ycovered with a faldyng reed;  
<span id="an_3213"></span> And al above ther lay a gay sautrie,  
<span id="an_3214"></span> On which he made a-nyghtes melodie  
<span id="an_3215"></span> So swetely that all the chambre rong;  
<span id="an_3216"></span> And Angelus ad virginem he song;  
<span id="an_3217"></span> And after that he song the Kynges Noote.  
<span id="an_3218"></span> Ful often blessed was his myrie throte.  
<span id="an_3219"></span> And thus this sweete clerk his tyme spente  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3220">3220</span></span> After his
freendes fyndyng and his rente.  
<span id="an_3221"></span> This carpenter hadde wedded newe a wyf,  
<span id="an_3222"></span> Which that he lovede moore than his lyf;  
<span id="an_3223"></span> Of eighteteene yeer she was of age.  
<span id="an_3224"></span> Jalous he was, and heeld hire narwe in
cage,  
<span id="an_3225"></span> For she was wylde and yong, and he was old  
<span id="an_3226"></span> And demed hymself been lik a cokewold.  
<span id="an_3227"></span> He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude,  
<span id="an_3228"></span> That bad man sholde wedde his simylitude.  
<span id="an_3229"></span> Men sholde wedden after hire estaat,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3230">3230</span></span> For youthe
and elde is often at debaat.  
<span id="an_3231"></span> But sith that he was fallen in the snare,  
<span id="an_3232"></span> He moste endure, as oother folk, his care.  
<span id="an_3233"></span> Fair was this yonge wyf, and therwithal  
<span id="an_3234"></span> As any wezele hir body gent and smal.  
<span id="an_3235"></span> A ceynt she werede, barred al of silk,  
<span id="an_3236"></span> A barmclooth as whit as morne milk  
<span id="an_3237"></span> Upon hir lendes, ful of many a goore.  
<span id="an_3238"></span> Whit was hir smok, and broyden al bifoore  
<span id="an_3239"></span> And eek bihynde, on hir coler aboute,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3240">3240</span></span> Of col-blak
silk, withinne and eek withoute.  
<span id="an_3241"></span> The tapes of hir white voluper  
<span id="an_3242"></span> Were of the same suyte of hir coler;  
<span id="an_3243"></span> Hir filet brood of silk, and set ful hye.  
<span id="an_3244"></span> And sikerly she hadde a likerous ye;  
<span id="an_3245"></span> Ful smale ypulled were hire browes two,  
<span id="an_3246"></span> And tho were bent and blake as any sloo.  
<span id="an_3247"></span> She was ful moore blisful on to see  
<span id="an_3248"></span> Than is the newe pere-jonette tree,  
<span id="an_3249"></span> And softer than the wolle is of a wether.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3250">3250</span></span> And by hir
girdel heeng a purs of lether,  
<span id="an_3251"></span> Tasseled with silk and perled with latoun.  
<span id="an_3252"></span> In al this world, to seken up and doun,  
<span id="an_3253"></span> There nys no man so wys that koude thenche  
<span id="an_3254"></span> So gay a popelote or swich a wenche.  
<span id="an_3255"></span> Ful brighter was the shynyng of hir hewe  
<span id="an_3256"></span> Than in the Tour the noble yforged newe.  
<span id="an_3257"></span> But of hir song, it was as loude and yerne  
<span id="an_3258"></span> As any swalwe sittynge on a berne.  
<span id="an_3259"></span> Therto she koude skippe and make game,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3260">3260</span></span> As any kyde
or calf folwynge his dame.  
<span id="an_3261"></span> Hir mouth was sweete as bragot or the
meeth,  
<span id="an_3262"></span> Or hoord of apples leyd in hey or heeth.  
<span id="an_3263"></span> Wynsynge she was, as is a joly colt,  
<span id="an_3264"></span> Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.  
<span id="an_3265"></span> A brooch she baar upon hir lowe coler,  
<span id="an_3266"></span> As brood as is the boos of a bokeler.  
<span id="an_3267"></span> Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye.  
<span id="an_3268"></span> She was a prymerole, a piggesnye,  
<span id="an_3269"></span> For any lord to leggen in his bedde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3270">3270</span></span> Or yet for
any good yeman to wedde.  
<span id="an_3271"></span> Now, sire, and eft, sire, so bifel the cas  
<span id="an_3272"></span> That on a day this hende Nicholas  
<span id="an_3273"></span> Fil with this yonge wyf to rage and pleye,  
<span id="an_3274"></span> Whil that hir housbonde was at Oseneye,  
<span id="an_3275"></span> As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  
<span id="an_3276"></span> And prively he caughte hire by the queynte,  
<span id="an_3277"></span> And seyde, "Ywis, but if ich have my wille,  
<span id="an_3278"></span> For deerne love of thee, lemman, I spille."  
<span id="an_3279"></span> And heeld hire harde by the haunchebones,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3280">3280</span></span> And seyde,
"Lemman, love me al atones,  
<span id="an_3281"></span> Or I wol dyen, also God me save!"  
<span id="an_3282"></span> And she sproong as a colt dooth in the
trave,  
<span id="an_3283"></span> And with hir heed she wryed faste awey,  
<span id="an_3284"></span> And seyde, "I wol nat kisse thee, by my
fey!  
<span id="an_3285"></span> Why, lat be!" quod she. "Lat be, Nicholas,  
<span id="an_3286"></span> Or I wol crie \`out, harrow' and \`allas'!  
<span id="an_3287"></span> Do wey youre handes, for youre curteisye!"  
<span id="an_3288"></span> This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye,  
<span id="an_3289"></span> And spak so faire, and profred him so
faste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3290">3290</span></span> That she
hir love hym graunted atte laste,  
<span id="an_3291"></span> And swoor hir ooth, by Seint Thomas of
Kent,  
<span id="an_3292"></span> That she wol been at his comandement,  
<span id="an_3293"></span> Whan that she may hir leyser wel espie.  
<span id="an_3294"></span> "Myn housbonde is so ful of jalousie  
<span id="an_3295"></span> That but ye wayte wel and been privee,  
<span id="an_3296"></span> I woot right wel I nam but deed," quod she.  
<span id="an_3297"></span> "Ye moste been ful deerne, as in this cas."  
<span id="an_3298"></span> "Nay, therof care thee noght," quod
Nicholas.  
<span id="an_3299"></span> "A clerk hadde litherly biset his whyle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3300">3300</span></span> But if he
koude a carpenter bigyle."  
<span id="an_3301"></span> And thus they been accorded and ysworn  
<span id="an_3302"></span> To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn.  
<span id="an_3303"></span> Whan Nicholas had doon thus everideel  
<span id="an_3304"></span> And thakked hire aboute the lendes weel,  
<span id="an_3305"></span> He kiste hire sweete and taketh his
sawtrie,  
<span id="an_3306"></span> And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodie.  
<span id="an_3307"></span> Thanne fil it thus, that to the paryssh
chirche,  
<span id="an_3308"></span> Cristes owene werkes for to wirche,  
<span id="an_3309"></span> This goode wyf went on an haliday.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3310">3310</span></span> Hir forheed
shoon as bright as any day,  
<span id="an_3311"></span> So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk.  
<span id="an_3312"></span> Now was ther of that chirche a parissh
clerk,  
<span id="an_3313"></span> The which that was ycleped Absolon.  
<span id="an_3314"></span> Crul was his heer, and as the gold it
shoon,  
<span id="an_3315"></span> And strouted as a fanne large and brode;  
<span id="an_3316"></span> Ful streight and evene lay his joly shode.  
<span id="an_3317"></span> His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos.  
<span id="an_3318"></span> With Poules wyndow corven on his shoos,  
<span id="an_3319"></span> In hoses rede he wente fetisly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3320">3320</span></span> Yclad he
was ful smal and proprely  
<span id="an_3321"></span> Al in a kirtel of a lyght waget;  
<span id="an_3322"></span> Ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set.  
<span id="an_3323"></span> And therupon he hadde a gay surplys  
<span id="an_3324"></span> As whit as is the blosme upon the rys.  
<span id="an_3325"></span> A myrie child he was, so God me save.  
<span id="an_3326"></span> Wel koude he laten blood, and clippe and
shave,  
<span id="an_3327"></span> And maken a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.  
<span id="an_3328"></span> In twenty manere koude he trippe and daunce  
<span id="an_3329"></span> After the scole of Oxenforde tho,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3330">3330</span></span> And with
his legges casten to and fro,  
<span id="an_3331"></span> And pleyen songes on a smal rubible;  
<span id="an_3332"></span> Therto he song som tyme a loud quynyble;  
<span id="an_3333"></span> And as wel koude he pleye on a giterne.  
<span id="an_3334"></span> In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne  
<span id="an_3335"></span> That he ne visited with his solas,  
<span id="an_3336"></span> Ther any gaylard tappestere was.  
<span id="an_3337"></span> But sooth to seyn, he was somdeel squaymous  
<span id="an_3338"></span> Of fartyng, and of speche daungerous.  
<span id="an_3339"></span> This Absolon, that jolif was and gay,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3340">3340</span></span> Gooth with
a sencer on the haliday,  
<span id="an_3341"></span> Sensynge the wyves of the parisshe faste;  
<span id="an_3342"></span> And many a lovely look on hem he caste,  
<span id="an_3343"></span> And namely on this carpenteris wyf.  
<span id="an_3344"></span> To looke on hire hym thoughte a myrie lyf,  
<span id="an_3345"></span> She was so propre and sweete and likerous.  
<span id="an_3346"></span> I dar wel seyn, if she hadde been a mous,  
<span id="an_3347"></span> And he a cat, he wolde hire hente anon.  
<span id="an_3348"></span> This parissh clerk, this joly Absolon,  
<span id="an_3349"></span> Hath in his herte swich a love-longynge  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3350">3350</span></span> That of no
wyf took he noon offrynge;  
<span id="an_3351"></span> For curteisie, he seyde, he wolde noon.  
<span id="an_3352"></span> The moone, whan it was nyght, ful brighte
shoon,  
<span id="an_3353"></span> And Absolon his gyterne hath ytake;  
<span id="an_3354"></span> For paramours he thoghte for to wake.  
<span id="an_3355"></span> And forth he gooth, jolif and amorous,  
<span id="an_3356"></span> Til he cam to the carpenteres hous  
<span id="an_3357"></span> A litel after cokkes hadde ycrowe,  
<span id="an_3358"></span> And dressed hym up by a shot-wyndowe  
<span id="an_3359"></span> That was upon the carpenteris wal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3360">3360</span></span> He syngeth
in his voys gentil and smal,  
<span id="an_3361"></span> "Now, deere lady, if thy wille be,  
<span id="an_3362"></span> I praye yow that ye wole rewe on me,"  
<span id="an_3363"></span> Ful wel acordaunt to his gyternynge.  
<span id="an_3364"></span> This carpenter awook, and herde him synge,  
<span id="an_3365"></span> And spak unto his wyf, and seyde anon,  
<span id="an_3366"></span> "What! Alison! Herestow nat Absolon,  
<span id="an_3367"></span> That chaunteth thus under oure boures wal?"  
<span id="an_3368"></span> And she answerde hir housbonde therwithal,  
<span id="an_3369"></span> "Yis, God woot, John, I heere it every
deel."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3370">3370</span></span> This
passeth forth; what wol ye bet than weel?  
<span id="an_3371"></span> Fro day to day this joly Absolon  
<span id="an_3372"></span> So woweth hire that hym is wo bigon.  
<span id="an_3373"></span> He waketh al the nyght and al the day;  
<span id="an_3374"></span> He kembeth his lokkes brode, and made hym
gay;  
<span id="an_3375"></span> He woweth hire by meenes and brocage,  
<span id="an_3376"></span> And swoor he wolde been hir owene page;  
<span id="an_3377"></span> He syngeth, brokkynge as a nyghtyngale;  
<span id="an_3378"></span> He sente hire pyment, meeth, and spiced
ale,  
<span id="an_3379"></span> And wafres, pipyng hoot out of the gleede;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3380">3380</span></span> And, for
she was of town, he profred meede;  
<span id="an_3381"></span> For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,  
<span id="an_3382"></span> And somme for strokes, and somme for
gentillesse.  
<span id="an_3383"></span> Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and
maistrye,  
<span id="an_3384"></span> He pleyeth Herodes upon a scaffold hye.  
<span id="an_3385"></span> But what availleth hym as in this cas?  
<span id="an_3386"></span> She loveth so this hende Nicholas  
<span id="an_3387"></span> That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn;  
<span id="an_3388"></span> He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn.  
<span id="an_3389"></span> And thus she maketh Absolon hire ape,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3390">3390</span></span> And al his
ernest turneth til a jape.  
<span id="an_3391"></span> Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,  
<span id="an_3392"></span> Men seyn right thus: "Alwey the nye slye  
<span id="an_3393"></span> Maketh the ferre leeve to be looth."  
<span id="an_3394"></span> For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,  
<span id="an_3395"></span> By cause that he fer was from hire sight,  
<span id="an_3396"></span> This nye Nicholas stood in his light.  
<span id="an_3397"></span> Now ber thee wel, thou hende Nicholas,  
<span id="an_3398"></span> For Absolon may waille and synge "allas."  
<span id="an_3399"></span> And so bifel it on a Saterday,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3400">3400</span></span> This
carpenter was goon til Osenay;  
<span id="an_3401"></span> And hende Nicholas and Alisoun  
<span id="an_3402"></span> Acorded been to this conclusioun,  
<span id="an_3403"></span> That Nicholas shal shapen hym a wyle  
<span id="an_3404"></span> This sely jalous housbonde to bigyle;  
<span id="an_3405"></span> And if so be the game wente aright,  
<span id="an_3406"></span> She sholde slepen in his arm al nyght,  
<span id="an_3407"></span> For this was his desir and hire also.  
<span id="an_3408"></span> And right anon, withouten wordes mo,  
<span id="an_3409"></span> This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3410">3410</span></span> But dooth
ful softe unto his chambre carie  
<span id="an_3411"></span> Bothe mete and drynke for a day or tweye,  
<span id="an_3412"></span> And to hire housbonde bad hire for to seye,  
<span id="an_3413"></span> If that he axed after Nicholas,  
<span id="an_3414"></span> She sholde seye she nyste where he was;  
<span id="an_3415"></span> Of al that day she saugh hym nat with ye;  
<span id="an_3416"></span> She trowed that he was in maladye,  
<span id="an_3417"></span> For, for no cry hir mayde koude hym calle,  
<span id="an_3418"></span> He nolde answere for thyng that myghte
falle.  
<span id="an_3419"></span> This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3420">3420</span></span> That
Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,  
<span id="an_3421"></span> And eet and sleep, or dide what hym leste,  
<span id="an_3422"></span> Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.  
<span id="an_3423"></span> This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle  
<span id="an_3424"></span> Of Nicholas, or what thyng myghte hym eyle,  
<span id="an_3425"></span> And seyde, "I am adrad, by Seint Thomas,  
<span id="an_3426"></span> It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.  
<span id="an_3427"></span> God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!  
<span id="an_3428"></span> This world is now ful tikel, sikerly.  
<span id="an_3429"></span> I saugh today a cors yborn to chirche  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3430">3430</span></span> That now,
on Monday last, I saugh hym wirche.  
<span id="an_3431"></span> "Go up," quod he unto his knave anoon,  
<span id="an_3432"></span> "Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon.  
<span id="an_3433"></span> Looke how it is, and tel me boldely."  
<span id="an_3434"></span> This knave gooth hym up ful sturdily,  
<span id="an_3435"></span> And at the chambre dore whil that he stood,  
<span id="an_3436"></span> He cride and knokked as that he were wood,  
<span id="an_3437"></span> "What, how! What do ye, maister Nicholay?  
<span id="an_3438"></span> How may ye slepen al the longe day?"  
<span id="an_3439"></span> But al for noght; he herde nat a word.

<span id="an_3744"></span> This sely Absolon herde every deel,  
<span id="an_3745"></span> And on his lippe he gan for anger byte,  
<span id="an_3746"></span> And to hymself he seyde, "I shal thee

<span id="an_3747"></span> Who rubbeth now, who froteth now his lippes  
<span id="an_3748"></span> With dust, with sond, with straw, with

<span id="an_3756"></span> Of paramours he sette nat a kers,  
<span id="an_3757"></span> For he was heeled of his maladie.  
<span id="an_3758"></span> Ful ofte paramours he gan deffie,  
<span id="an_3759"></span> And weep as dooth a child that is ybete.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3760">3760</span></span> A softe

<span id="an_3772"></span> This Absolon ne roghte nat a bene  
<span id="an_3773"></span> Of al his pley; no word agayn he yaf;  
<span id="an_3774"></span> He hadde moore tow on his distaf  
<span id="an_3775"></span> Than Gerveys knew, and seyde, "Freend so

<span id="an_3777"></span> As lene it me; I have therwith to doone,  
<span id="an_3778"></span> And I wol brynge it thee agayn ful soone."  
<span id="an_3779"></span> Gerveys answerde, "Certes, were it gold,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3780">3780</span></span> Or in a
poke nobles alle untold,  
<span id="an_3781"></span> Thou sholdest have, as I am trewe smyth.  
<span id="an_3782"></span> Ey, Cristes foo! What wol ye do therwith?"  
<span id="an_3783"></span> "Therof," quod Absolon, "be as be may.  
<span id="an_3784"></span> I shal wel telle it thee to-morwe day" --  
<span id="an_3785"></span> And caughte the kultour by the colde stele.  
<span id="an_3786"></span> Ful softe out at the dore he gan to stele,  
<span id="an_3787"></span> And wente unto the carpenteris wal.  
<span id="an_3788"></span> He cogheth first, and knokketh therwithal  
<span id="an_3789"></span> Upon the wyndowe, right as he dide er.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3790">3790</span></span> This Alison
answerde, "Who is ther  
<span id="an_3791"></span> That knokketh so? I warante it a theef."  
<span id="an_3792"></span> "Why, nay," quod he, "God woot, my sweete
leef,  
<span id="an_3793"></span> I am thyn Absolon, my deerelyng.  
<span id="an_3794"></span> Of gold," quod he, "I have thee broght a

<span id="an_3797"></span> This wol I yeve thee, if thou me kisse."  
<span id="an_3798"></span> This Nicholas was risen for to pisse,  
<span id="an_3799"></span> And thoughte he wolde amenden al the jape;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3800">3800</span></span> He sholde
kisse his ers er that he scape.  
<span id="an_3801"></span> And up the wyndowe dide he hastily,  
<span id="an_3802"></span> And out his ers he putteth pryvely  
<span id="an_3803"></span> Over the buttok, to the haunche-bon;  
<span id="an_3804"></span> And therwith spak this clerk, this Absolon,  
<span id="an_3805"></span> "Spek, sweete bryd, I noot nat where thou

<span id="an_3806"></span> This Nicholas anon leet fle a fart  
<span id="an_3807"></span> As greet as it had been a thonder-dent,  
<span id="an_3808"></span> That with the strook he was almoost yblent;  
<span id="an_3809"></span> And he was redy with his iren hoot,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3810">3810</span></span> And
Nicholas amydde the ers he smoot.  
<span id="an_3811"></span> Of gooth the skyn an hande-brede aboute,  
<span id="an_3812"></span> The hoote kultour brende so his toute,  
<span id="an_3813"></span> And for the smert he wende for to dye.  
<span id="an_3814"></span> As he were wood, for wo he gan to crye,  
<span id="an_3815"></span> "Help! Water! Water! Help, for Goddes
herte!"  
<span id="an_3816"></span> This carpenter out of his slomber sterte,  
<span id="an_3817"></span> And herde oon crien "water!" as he were

<span id="an_3818"></span> And thoughte, "Allas, now comth Nowelis

<span id="an_3819"></span> He sit hym up withouten wordes mo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3820">3820</span></span> And with
his ax he smoot the corde atwo,  
<span id="an_3821"></span> And doun gooth al; he foond neither to

<span id="an_3822"></span> Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the celle  
<span id="an_3823"></span> Upon the floor, and ther aswowne he lay.  
<span id="an_3824"></span> Up stirte hire Alison and Nicholay,  
<span id="an_3825"></span> And criden "Out" and "Harrow" in the

<span id="an_3826"></span> The neighebores, bothe smale and grete,  
<span id="an_3827"></span> In ronnen for to gauren on this man,  
<span id="an_3828"></span> That yet aswowne lay, bothe pale and wan,  
<span id="an_3829"></span> For with the fal he brosten hadde his arm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3830">3830</span></span> But stonde
he moste unto his owene harm;  
<span id="an_3831"></span> For whan he spak, he was anon bore doun  
<span id="an_3832"></span> With hende Nicholas and Alisoun.  
<span id="an_3833"></span> They tolden every man that he was wood;  
<span id="an_3834"></span> He was agast so of Nowelis flood  
<span id="an_3835"></span> Thurgh fantasie that of his vanytee  
<span id="an_3836"></span> He hadde yboght hym knedyng tubbes thre,  
<span id="an_3837"></span> And hadde hem hanged in the roof above;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3840">3840</span></span> The folk
gan laughen at his fantasye;  
<span id="an_3841"></span> Into the roof they kiken and they cape,  
<span id="an_3842"></span> And turned al his harm unto a jape.  
<span id="an_3843"></span> For what so that this carpenter answerde,  
<span id="an_3844"></span> It was for noght; no man his reson herde.  
<span id="an_3845"></span> With othes grete he was so sworn adoun  
<span id="an_3846"></span> That he was holde wood in al the toun;

<span id="an_3849"></span> And every wight gan laughen at this stryf.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3850">3850</span></span> Thus swyved
was this carpenteris wyf,  
<span id="an_3851"></span> For al his kepyng and his jalousye,  
<span id="an_3852"></span> And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye,  
<span id="an_3853"></span> And Nicholas is scalded in the towte.  
<span id="an_3854"></span> This tale is doon, and God save al the
