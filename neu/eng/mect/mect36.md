#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Monk's Tale

<span id="an_1991"></span> I wol biwaille in manere of tragedie  
<span id="an_1992"></span> The harm of hem that stoode in heigh
degree,  
<span id="an_1993"></span> And fillen so that ther nas no remedie  
<span id="an_1994"></span> To brynge hem out of hir adversitee.  
<span id="an_1995"></span> For certein, whan that Fortune list to
flee,  
<span id="an_1996"></span> Ther may no man the cours of hire
withholde.  
<span id="an_1997"></span> Lat no man truste on blynd prosperitee;  
<span id="an_1998"></span> Be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde.  
<span id="an_1999"></span> At Lucifer, though he an angel were  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2000">2000</span></span> And nat a
man, at hym wol I bigynne.  
<span id="an_2001"></span> For though Fortune may noon angel dere,  
<span id="an_2002"></span> From heigh degree yet fel he for his synne  
<span id="an_2003"></span> Doun into helle, where he yet is inne.  
<span id="an_2004"></span> O Lucifer, brightest of angels alle,  
<span id="an_2005"></span> Now artow Sathanas, that mayst nat twynne  
<span id="an_2006"></span> Out of miserie, in which that thou art
falle.  
<span id="an_2007"></span> Loo Adam, in the feeld of Damyssene  
<span id="an_2008"></span> With Goddes owene fynger wroght was he,  
<span id="an_2009"></span> And nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010">2010</span></span> And welte
al paradys savynge o tree.  
<span id="an_2011"></span> Hadde nevere worldly man so heigh degree  
<span id="an_2012"></span> As Adam, til he for mysgovernaunce  
<span id="an_2013"></span> Was dryven out of hys hye prosperitee  
<span id="an_2014"></span> To labour, and to helle, and to meschaunce.  
<span id="an_2015"></span> Loo Sampsoun, which that was annunciat  
<span id="an_2016"></span> By th' angel longe er his nativitee,  
<span id="an_2017"></span> And was to God Almyghty consecrat,  
<span id="an_2018"></span> And stood in noblesse whil he myghte see.  
<span id="an_2019"></span> Was nevere swich another as was hee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2020">2020</span></span> To speke of
strengthe, and therwith hardynesse;  
<span id="an_2021"></span> But to his wyves toolde he his secree,  
<span id="an_2022"></span> Thurgh which he slow hymself for
wrecchednesse.  
<span id="an_2023"></span> Sampsoun, this noble almyghty champioun,  
<span id="an_2024"></span> Withouten wepen save his handes tweye,  
<span id="an_2025"></span> He slow and al torente the leoun,  
<span id="an_2026"></span> Toward his weddyng walkynge by the weye.  
<span id="an_2027"></span> His false wyf koude hym so plese and preye  
<span id="an_2028"></span> Til she his conseil knew; and she, untrewe,  
<span id="an_2029"></span> Unto his foos his conseil gan biwreye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2030">2030</span></span> And hym
forsook, and took another newe.  
<span id="an_2031"></span> Thre hundred foxes took Sampson for ire,  
<span id="an_2032"></span> And alle hir tayles he togydre bond,  
<span id="an_2033"></span> And sette the foxes tayles alle on fire,  
<span id="an_2034"></span> For he on every tayl had knyt a brond;  
<span id="an_2035"></span> And they brende alle the cornes in that
lond,  
<span id="an_2036"></span> And alle hire olyveres, and vynes eke.  
<span id="an_2037"></span> A thousand men he slow eek with his hond,  
<span id="an_2038"></span> And hadde no wepen but an asses cheke.  
<span id="an_2039"></span> Whan they were slayn, so thursted hym that
he  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2040">2040</span></span> Was wel ny
lorn, for which he gan to preye  
<span id="an_2041"></span> That God wolde on his peyne han some pitee  
<span id="an_2042"></span> And sende hym drynke, or elles moste he
deye;  
<span id="an_2043"></span> And of this asses cheke, that was dreye,  
<span id="an_2044"></span> Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a welle,  
<span id="an_2045"></span> Of which he drank ynogh, shortly to seye;  
<span id="an_2046"></span> Thus heelp hym God, as Judicum can telle.  
<span id="an_2047"></span> By verray force at Gazan on a nyght,  
<span id="an_2048"></span> Maugree Philistiens of that citee,  
<span id="an_2049"></span> The gates of the toun he hath up plyght,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2050">2050</span></span> And on his
bak ycaryed hem hath hee  
<span id="an_2051"></span> Hye on an hill whereas men myghte hem see.  
<span id="an_2052"></span> O noble, almyghty Sampsoun, lief and deere,  
<span id="an_2053"></span> Had thou nat toold to wommen thy secree,  
<span id="an_2054"></span> In al this world ne hadde been thy peere!  
<span id="an_2055"></span> This Sampson nevere ciser drank ne wyn,  
<span id="an_2056"></span> Ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne sheere,  
<span id="an_2057"></span> By precept of the messager divyn,  
<span id="an_2058"></span> For alle his strengthes in his heeres
weere.  
<span id="an_2059"></span> And fully twenty wynter, yeer by yeere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2060">2060</span></span> He hadde of
Israel the governaunce.  
<span id="an_2061"></span> But soone shal he wepe many a teere,  
<span id="an_2062"></span> For wommen shal hym bryngen to meschaunce!  
<span id="an_2063"></span> Unto his lemman Dalida he tolde  
<span id="an_2064"></span> That in his heeris al his strengthe lay,  
<span id="an_2065"></span> And falsly to his foomen she hym solde.  
<span id="an_2066"></span> And slepynge in hir barm upon a day,  
<span id="an_2067"></span> She made to clippe or shere his heres away,  
<span id="an_2068"></span> And made his foomen al his craft espyen;  
<span id="an_2069"></span> And whan that they hym foond in this array,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2070">2070</span></span> They bounde
hym faste and putten out his yen.  
<span id="an_2071"></span> But er his heer were clipped or yshave,  
<span id="an_2072"></span> Ther was no boond with which men myghte him
bynde;  
<span id="an_2073"></span> But now is he in prison in a cave,  
<span id="an_2074"></span> Where-as they made hym at the queerne
grynde.  
<span id="an_2075"></span> O noble Sampsoun, strongest of mankynde,  
<span id="an_2076"></span> O whilom juge, in glorie and in richesse!  
<span id="an_2077"></span> Now maystow wepen with thyne eyen blynde,  
<span id="an_2078"></span> Sith thou fro wele art falle in
wrecchednesse.  
<span id="an_2079"></span> The ende of this caytyf was as I shal seye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2080">2080</span></span> His foomen
made a feeste upon a day,  
<span id="an_2081"></span> And made hym as hire fool biforn hem pleye;  
<span id="an_2082"></span> And this was in a temple of greet array.  
<span id="an_2083"></span> But atte laste he made a foul affray,  
<span id="an_2084"></span> For he two pilers shook and made hem falle,  
<span id="an_2085"></span> And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay
--  
<span id="an_2086"></span> And slow hymself, and eek his foomen alle.  
<span id="an_2087"></span> This is to seyn, the prynces everichoon,  
<span id="an_2088"></span> And eek thre thousand bodyes, were ther
slayn  
<span id="an_2089"></span> With fallynge of the grete temple of stoon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2090">2090</span></span> Of Sampson
now wol I namoore sayn.  
<span id="an_2091"></span> Beth war by this ensample oold and playn  
<span id="an_2092"></span> That no men telle hir conseil til hir wyves  
<span id="an_2093"></span> Of swich thyng as they wolde han secree
fayn,  
<span id="an_2094"></span> If that it touche hir lymes or hir lyves.  
<span id="an_2095"></span> Of Hercules, the sovereyn conquerour,  
<span id="an_2096"></span> Syngen his werkes laude and heigh renoun;  
<span id="an_2097"></span> For in his tyme of strengthe he was the
flour.  
<span id="an_2098"></span> He slow and rafte the skyn of the leoun;  
<span id="an_2099"></span> He of Centauros leyde the boost adoun;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2100">2100</span></span> He Arpies
slow, the crueel bryddes felle;  
<span id="an_2101"></span> He golden apples rafte of the dragoun;  
<span id="an_2102"></span> He drow out Cerberus, the hound of helle;  
<span id="an_2103"></span> He slow the crueel tyrant Busirus  
<span id="an_2104"></span> And made his hors to frete hym, flessh and
boon;  
<span id="an_2105"></span> He slow the firy serpent venymus;  
<span id="an_2106"></span> Of Acheloys two hornes he brak oon;  
<span id="an_2107"></span> And he slow Cacus in a cave of stoon;  
<span id="an_2108"></span> He slow the geant Antheus the stronge;  
<span id="an_2109"></span> He slow the grisly boor, and that anon;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2110">2110</span></span> And bar the
hevene on his nekke longe.  
<span id="an_2111"></span> Was nevere wight, sith that this world
bigan,  
<span id="an_2112"></span> That slow so manye monstres as dide he.  
<span id="an_2113"></span> Thurghout this wyde world his name ran,  
<span id="an_2114"></span> What for his strengthe and for his heigh
bountee,  
<span id="an_2115"></span> And every reawme wente he for to see.  
<span id="an_2116"></span> He was so stroong that no man myghte hym
lette.  
<span id="an_2117"></span> At bothe the worldes endes, seith Trophee,  
<span id="an_2118"></span> In stide of boundes he a pileer sette.  
<span id="an_2119"></span> A lemman hadde this noble champioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2120">2120</span></span> That highte
Dianira, fressh as May;  
<span id="an_2121"></span> And as thise clerkes maken mencioun,  
<span id="an_2122"></span> She hath hym sent a sherte, fressh and gay.  
<span id="an_2123"></span> Allas, this sherte -- allas and weylaway!
--  
<span id="an_2124"></span> Envenymed was so subtilly withalle  
<span id="an_2125"></span> That er that he had wered it half a day  
<span id="an_2126"></span> It made his flessh al from his bones falle.  
<span id="an_2127"></span> But nathelees somme clerkes hire excusen  
<span id="an_2128"></span> By oon that highte Nessus, that it maked.  
<span id="an_2129"></span> Be as be may, I wol hire noght accusen;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2130">2130</span></span> But on his
bak this sherte he wered al naked  
<span id="an_2131"></span> Til that his flessh was for the venym
blaked.  
<span id="an_2132"></span> And whan he saugh noon oother remedye,  
<span id="an_2133"></span> In hoote coles he hath hymselven raked,  
<span id="an_2134"></span> For with no venym deigned hym to dye.  
<span id="an_2135"></span> Thus starf this worthy, myghty Hercules.  
<span id="an_2136"></span> Lo, who may truste on Fortune any throwe?  
<span id="an_2137"></span> For hym that folweth al this world of prees  
<span id="an_2138"></span> Er he be war is ofte yleyd ful lowe.  
<span id="an_2139"></span> Ful wys is he that kan hymselven knowe!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2140">2140</span></span> Beth war,
for whan that Fortune list to glose,  
<span id="an_2141"></span> Thanne wayteth she her man to overthrowe  
<span id="an_2142"></span> By swich a wey as he wolde leest suppose.  
<span id="an_2143"></span> The myghty trone, the precious tresor,  
<span id="an_2144"></span> The glorious ceptre, and roial magestee  
<span id="an_2145"></span> That hadde the kyng Nabugodonosor  
<span id="an_2146"></span> With tonge unnethe may discryved bee.  
<span id="an_2147"></span> He twyes wan Jerusalem the citee;  
<span id="an_2148"></span> The vessel of the temple he with hym ladde.  
<span id="an_2149"></span> At Babiloigne was his sovereyn see,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2150">2150</span></span> In which
his glorie and his delit he hadde.  
<span id="an_2151"></span> The faireste children of the blood roial  
<span id="an_2152"></span> Of Israel he leet do gelde anoon,  
<span id="an_2153"></span> And maked ech of hem to been his thral.  
<span id="an_2154"></span> Amonges othere Daniel was oon,  
<span id="an_2155"></span> That was the wiseste child of everychon,  
<span id="an_2156"></span> For he the dremes of the kyng expowned,  
<span id="an_2157"></span> Whereas in Chaldeye clerk ne was ther noon  
<span id="an_2158"></span> That wiste to what fyn his dremes sowned.  
<span id="an_2159"></span> This proude kyng leet maken a statue of
gold,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2160">2160</span></span> Sixty
cubites long and sevene in brede,  
<span id="an_2161"></span> To which ymage bothe yong and oold  
<span id="an_2162"></span> Comanded he to loute, and have in drede,  
<span id="an_2163"></span> Or in a fourneys, ful of flambes rede,  
<span id="an_2164"></span> He shal be brent that wolde noght obeye.  
<span id="an_2165"></span> But nevere wolde assente to that dede  
<span id="an_2166"></span> Daniel ne his yonge felawes tweye.  
<span id="an_2167"></span> This kyng of kynges proud was and elaat;  
<span id="an_2168"></span> He wende that God, that sit in magestee,  
<span id="an_2169"></span> Ne myghte hym nat bireve of his estaat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2170">2170</span></span> But
sodeynly he loste his dignytee,  
<span id="an_2171"></span> And lyk a beest hym semed for to bee,  
<span id="an_2172"></span> And eet hey as an oxe, and lay theroute  
<span id="an_2173"></span> In reyn; with wilde beestes walked hee  
<span id="an_2174"></span> Til certein tyme was ycome aboute.  
<span id="an_2175"></span> And lik an egles fetheres wax his heres;  
<span id="an_2176"></span> His nayles lyk a briddes clawes weere;  
<span id="an_2177"></span> Til God relessed hym a certeyn yeres,  
<span id="an_2178"></span> And yaf hym wit, and thanne with many a
teere  
<span id="an_2179"></span> He thanked God, and evere his lyf in feere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2180">2180</span></span> Was he to
doon amys or moore trespace;  
<span id="an_2181"></span> And til that tyme he leyd was on his beere  
<span id="an_2182"></span> He knew that God was ful of myght and
grace.  
<span id="an_2183"></span> His sone, which that highte Balthasar,  
<span id="an_2184"></span> That heeld the regne after his fader day,  
<span id="an_2185"></span> He by his fader koude noght be war,  
<span id="an_2186"></span> For proud he was of herte and of array,  
<span id="an_2187"></span> And eek an ydolastre was he ay.  
<span id="an_2188"></span> His hye estaat assured hym in pryde;  
<span id="an_2189"></span> But Fortune caste hym doun, and ther he
lay,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2190">2190</span></span> And
sodeynly his regne gan divide.  
<span id="an_2191"></span> A feeste he made unto his lordes alle  
<span id="an_2192"></span> Upon a tyme and bad hem blithe bee;  
<span id="an_2193"></span> And thanne his officeres gan he calle:  
<span id="an_2194"></span> "Gooth, bryngeth forth the vesseles," quod
he,  
<span id="an_2195"></span> "Whiche that my fader in his prosperitee  
<span id="an_2196"></span> Out of the temple of Jerusalem birafte;  
<span id="an_2197"></span> And to oure hye goddes thanke we  
<span id="an_2198"></span> Of honour that oure eldres with us lafte."  
<span id="an_2199"></span> Hys wyf, his lordes, and his concubynes  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2200">2200</span></span> Ay dronken,
whil hire appetites laste,  
<span id="an_2201"></span> Out of thise noble vessels sondry wynes.  
<span id="an_2202"></span> And on a wal this kyng his eyen caste  
<span id="an_2203"></span> And saugh an hand, armlees, that wroot ful
faste,  
<span id="an_2204"></span> For feere of which he quook and siked
soore.  
<span id="an_2205"></span> This hand that Balthasar so soore agaste  
<span id="an_2206"></span> Wroot Mane, techel, phares, and namoore.  
<span id="an_2207"></span> In all that land magicien was noon  
<span id="an_2208"></span> That koude expoune what this lettre mente;  
<span id="an_2209"></span> But Daniel expowned it anoon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2210">2210</span></span> And seyde,
"Kyng, God to thy fader lente  
<span id="an_2211"></span> Glorie and honour, regne, tresour, rente;  
<span id="an_2212"></span> And he was proud and nothyng God ne dradde,  
<span id="an_2213"></span> And therfore God greet wreche upon hym
sente,  
<span id="an_2214"></span> And hym birafte the regne that he hadde.  
<span id="an_2215"></span> "He was out cast of mannes compaignye;  
<span id="an_2216"></span> With asses was his habitacioun,  
<span id="an_2217"></span> And eet hey as a beest in weet and drye  
<span id="an_2218"></span> Til that he knew, by grace and by resoun,  
<span id="an_2219"></span> That God of hevene hath domynacioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2220">2220</span></span> Over every
regne and every creature;  
<span id="an_2221"></span> And thanne hadde God of hym compassioun,  
<span id="an_2222"></span> And hym restored his regne and his figure.  
<span id="an_2223"></span> "Eek thou, that art his sone, art proud
also,  
<span id="an_2224"></span> And knowest alle thise thynges verraily,

<span id="an_2226"></span> Thou drank eek of his vessels boldely;  
<span id="an_2227"></span> Thy wyf eek, and thy wenches, synfully  
<span id="an_2228"></span> Dronke of the same vessels sondry wynys;  
<span id="an_2229"></span> And heryest false goddes cursedly;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2230">2230</span></span> Therefore
to thee yshapen ful greet pyne ys.  
<span id="an_2231"></span> "This hand was sent from God that on the

<span id="an_2234"></span> Dyvyded is thy regne, and it shal be  
<span id="an_2235"></span> To Medes and to Perses yeven," quod he.  
<span id="an_2236"></span> And thilke same nyght this kyng was slawe,  
<span id="an_2237"></span> And Darius occupieth his degree,  
<span id="an_2238"></span> Thogh he therto hadde neither right ne

<span id="an_2244"></span> For what man that hath freendes thurgh
Fortune,  
<span id="an_2245"></span> Mishap wol maken hem enemys, I gesse;  
<span id="an_2246"></span> This proverbe is ful sooth and ful commune.  
<span id="an_2247"></span> Cenobia, of Palymerie queene,  
<span id="an_2248"></span> As writen Persiens of hir noblesse,  
<span id="an_2249"></span> So worthy was in armes and so keene  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2250">2250</span></span> That no
wight passed hire in hardynesse,  
<span id="an_2251"></span> Ne in lynage, ne in oother gentillesse.  
<span id="an_2252"></span> Of kynges blood of Perce is she descended.  
<span id="an_2253"></span> I seye nat that she hadde moost fairnesse,  
<span id="an_2254"></span> But of hir shap she myghte nat been
amended.  
<span id="an_2255"></span> From hire childhede I fynde that she fledde  
<span id="an_2256"></span> Office of wommen, and to wode she wente,  
<span id="an_2257"></span> And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde  
<span id="an_2258"></span> With arwes brode that she to hem sente.  
<span id="an_2259"></span> She was so swift that she anon hem hente;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2260">2260</span></span> And whan
that she was elder, she wolde kille  
<span id="an_2261"></span> Leouns, leopardes, and beres al torente,  
<span id="an_2262"></span> And in hir armes weelde hem at hir wille.  
<span id="an_2263"></span> She dorste wilde beestes dennes seke,  
<span id="an_2264"></span> And rennen in the montaignes al the nyght,  
<span id="an_2265"></span> And slepen under a bussh, and she koude eke  
<span id="an_2266"></span> Wrastlen, by verray force and verray myght,  
<span id="an_2267"></span> With any yong man, were he never so wight.  
<span id="an_2268"></span> Ther myghte no thyng in hir armes stonde.  
<span id="an_2269"></span> She kepte hir maydenhod from every wight;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2270">2270</span></span> To no man
deigned hire for to be bonde.  
<span id="an_2271"></span> But atte laste hir freendes han hire maried  
<span id="an_2272"></span> To Odenake, a prynce of that contree,  
<span id="an_2273"></span> Al were it so that she hem longe taried.  
<span id="an_2274"></span> And ye shul understonde how that he  
<span id="an_2275"></span> Hadde swiche fantasies as hadde she.  
<span id="an_2276"></span> But natheless, whan they were knyt
in-feere,  
<span id="an_2277"></span> They lyved in joye and in felicitee,  
<span id="an_2278"></span> For ech of hem hadde oother lief and deere,  
<span id="an_2279"></span> Save o thyng: that she wolde nevere
assente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2280">2280</span></span> By no wey,
that he sholde by hire lye  
<span id="an_2281"></span> But ones, for it was hir pleyn entente  
<span id="an_2282"></span> To have a child, the world to multiplye;  
<span id="an_2283"></span> And also soone as that she myghte espye  
<span id="an_2284"></span> That she was nat with childe with that
dede,  
<span id="an_2285"></span> Thanne wolde she suffre hym doon his
fantasye  
<span id="an_2286"></span> Eft-soone, and nat but oones, out of drede.  
<span id="an_2287"></span> And if she were with childe at thilke cast,  
<span id="an_2288"></span> Namoore sholde he pleyen thilke game  
<span id="an_2289"></span> Til fully fourty \[wikes\] weren past;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2290">2290</span></span> Thanne
wolde she ones suffre hym do the same.  
<span id="an_2291"></span> Al were this Odenake wilde or tame,  
<span id="an_2292"></span> He gat namoore of hire, for thus she seyde:  
<span id="an_2293"></span> It was to wyves lecherie and shame,  
<span id="an_2294"></span> In oother caas, if that men with hem
pleyde.  
<span id="an_2295"></span> Two sones by this Odenake hadde she,  
<span id="an_2296"></span> The whiche she kepte in vertu and lettrure.  
<span id="an_2297"></span> But now unto oure tale turne we.  
<span id="an_2298"></span> I seye, so worshipful a creature,  
<span id="an_2299"></span> And wys therwith, and large with mesure,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2300">2300</span></span> So penyble

<span id="an_2301"></span> Ne moore labour myghte in werre endure,  
<span id="an_2302"></span> Was noon, though al this world men sholde
seke.  
<span id="an_2303"></span> Hir riche array ne myghte nat be told,  
<span id="an_2304"></span> As wel in vessel as in hire clothyng.  
<span id="an_2305"></span> She was al clad in perree and in gold,  
<span id="an_2306"></span> And eek she lafte noght, for noon huntyng,  
<span id="an_2307"></span> To have of sondry tonges ful knowyng,  
<span id="an_2308"></span> Whan that she leyser hadde; and for to

<span id="an_2309"></span> To lerne bookes was al hire likyng,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2310">2310</span></span> How she in
vertu myghte hir lyf dispende.  
<span id="an_2311"></span> And shortly of this storie for to trete,  
<span id="an_2312"></span> So doghty was hir housbonde and eek she,  
<span id="an_2313"></span> That they conquered manye regnes grete  
<span id="an_2314"></span> In the orient, with many a fair citee  
<span id="an_2315"></span> Apertenaunt unto the magestee  
<span id="an_2316"></span> Of Rome, and with strong hond held hem ful

<span id="an_2317"></span> Ne nevere myghte hir foomen doon hem flee,  
<span id="an_2318"></span> Ay whil that Odenakes dayes laste.  
<span id="an_2319"></span> Hir batailles, whoso list hem for to rede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2320">2320</span></span> Agayn Sapor

<span id="an_2322"></span> Why she conquered and what title had
therto,  
<span id="an_2323"></span> And after, of hir meschief and hire wo,  
<span id="an_2324"></span> How that she was biseged and ytake --  
<span id="an_2325"></span> Lat hym unto my maister Petrak go,  
<span id="an_2326"></span> That writ ynough of this, I undertake.  
<span id="an_2327"></span> Whan Odenake was deed, she myghtily  
<span id="an_2328"></span> The regnes heeld, and with hire propre hond  
<span id="an_2329"></span> Agayn hir foos she faught so cruelly  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2330">2330</span></span> That ther

<span id="an_2331"></span> That he nas glad, if he that grace fond,  
<span id="an_2332"></span> That she ne wolde upon his lond werreye.  
<span id="an_2333"></span> With hire they maden alliance by bond  
<span id="an_2334"></span> To been in pees, and lete hire ride and
pleye.  
<span id="an_2335"></span> The Emperour of Rome, Claudius  
<span id="an_2336"></span> Ne hym bifore, the Romayn Galien,  
<span id="an_2337"></span> Ne dorste nevere been so corageus,  
<span id="an_2338"></span> Ne noon Ermyn, ne noon Egipcien,  
<span id="an_2339"></span> Ne Surrien, ne noon Arabyen,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2340">2340</span></span> Withinne
the feeld that dorste with hire fighte,  
<span id="an_2341"></span> Lest that she wolde hem with hir handes
slen,  
<span id="an_2342"></span> Or with hir meignee putten hem to flighte.  
<span id="an_2343"></span> In kynges habit wente hir sones two,  
<span id="an_2344"></span> As heires of hir fadres regnes alle,  
<span id="an_2345"></span> And Hermanno and Thymalao  
<span id="an_2346"></span> Hir names were, as Persiens hem calle.  
<span id="an_2347"></span> But ay Fortune hath in hire hony galle;  
<span id="an_2348"></span> This myghty queene may no while endure.  
<span id="an_2349"></span> Fortune out of hir regne made hire falle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2350">2350</span></span> To
wrecchednesse and to mysaventure.  
<span id="an_2351"></span> Aurelian, whan that the governaunce  
<span id="an_2352"></span> Of Rome cam into his handes tweye,  
<span id="an_2353"></span> He shoop upon this queene to doon
vengeaunce.  
<span id="an_2354"></span> And with his legions he took his weye  
<span id="an_2355"></span> Toward Cenobie, and shortly for to seye,  
<span id="an_2356"></span> He made hire flee, and atte laste hire
hente,  
<span id="an_2357"></span> And fettred hire, and eek hire children
tweye,  
<span id="an_2358"></span> And wan the land, and hoom to Rome he
wente.  
<span id="an_2359"></span> Amonges othere thynges that he wan,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2360">2360</span></span> Hir chaar,
that was with gold wroght and perree,  
<span id="an_2361"></span> This grete Romayn, this Aurelian,  
<span id="an_2362"></span> Hath with hym lad, for that men sholde it
see.  
<span id="an_2363"></span> Biforen his triumphe walketh shee,  
<span id="an_2364"></span> With gilte cheynes on hire nekke hangynge.  
<span id="an_2365"></span> Coroned was she, as after hir degree,  
<span id="an_2366"></span> And ful of perree charged hire clothynge.  
<span id="an_2367"></span> Allas, Fortune! She that whilom was  
<span id="an_2368"></span> Dredeful to kynges and to emperoures,  
<span id="an_2369"></span> Now gaureth al the peple on hire, allas!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2370">2370</span></span> And she
that helmed was in starke stoures  
<span id="an_2371"></span> And wan by force townes stronge and toures,  
<span id="an_2372"></span> Shal on hir heed now were a vitremyte;  
<span id="an_2373"></span> And she that bar the ceptre ful of floures  
<span id="an_2374"></span> Shal bere a distaf, hire cost for to quyte.  
<span id="an_2375"></span> O noble, O worthy Petro, glorie of Spayne,  
<span id="an_2376"></span> Whom Fortune heeld so hye in magestee,  
<span id="an_2377"></span> Wel oghten men thy pitous deeth complayne!  
<span id="an_2378"></span> Out of thy land thy brother made thee flee,  
<span id="an_2379"></span> And after, at a seege, by subtiltee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2380">2380</span></span> Thou were
bitraysed and lad unto his tente,  
<span id="an_2381"></span> Where as he with his owene hand slow thee,  
<span id="an_2382"></span> Succedynge in thy regne and in thy rente.  
<span id="an_2383"></span> The feeld of snow, with th' egle of blak
therinne,  
<span id="an_2384"></span> Caught with the lymrod coloured as the

<span id="an_2385"></span> He brew this cursednesse and al this synne.  
<span id="an_2386"></span> The wikked nest was werker of this nede.  
<span id="an_2387"></span> Noght Charles Olyver, that took ay heede  
<span id="an_2388"></span> Of trouthe and honour, but of Armorike  
<span id="an_2389"></span> Genylon-Olyver, corrupt for meede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2390">2390</span></span> Broghte
this worthy kyng in swich a brike.  
<span id="an_2391"></span> O worthy Petro, kyng of Cipre, also,  
<span id="an_2392"></span> That Alisandre wan by heigh maistrie,  
<span id="an_2393"></span> Ful many an hethen wroghtestow ful wo,  
<span id="an_2394"></span> Of which thyne owene liges hadde envie,  
<span id="an_2395"></span> And for no thyng but for thy chivalrie  
<span id="an_2396"></span> They in thy bed han slayn thee by the
morwe.  
<span id="an_2397"></span> Thus kan Fortune hir wheel governe and gye,  
<span id="an_2398"></span> And out of joye brynge men to sorwe.  
<span id="an_2399"></span> Off Melan grete Barnabo Viscounte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2400">2400</span></span> God of
delit and scourge of Lumbardye,  
<span id="an_2401"></span> Why sholde I nat thyn infortune acounte,  
<span id="an_2402"></span> Sith in estaat thow cloumbe were so hye?  
<span id="an_2403"></span> Thy brother sone, that was thy double
allye,  
<span id="an_2404"></span> For he thy nevew was and sone-in-lawe,  
<span id="an_2405"></span> Withinne his prisoun made thee to dye --  
<span id="an_2406"></span> But why ne how noot I that thou were slawe.  
<span id="an_2407"></span> Off the Erl Hugelyn of Pyze the langour  
<span id="an_2408"></span> Ther may no tonge telle for pitee.  
<span id="an_2409"></span> But litel out of Pize stant a tour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2410">2410</span></span> In which
tour in prisoun put was he,  
<span id="an_2411"></span> And with hym been his litel children thre;  
<span id="an_2412"></span> The eldest scarsly fyf yeer was of age.  
<span id="an_2413"></span> Allas, Fortune, it was greet crueltee  
<span id="an_2414"></span> Swiche briddes for to putte in swich a
cage!  
<span id="an_2415"></span> Dampned was he to dyen in that prisoun,  
<span id="an_2416"></span> For Roger, which that bisshop was of Pize,  
<span id="an_2417"></span> Hadde on hym maad a fals suggestioun,  
<span id="an_2418"></span> Thurgh which the peple gan upon hym rise  
<span id="an_2419"></span> And putten hym to prisoun in swich wise  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2420">2420</span></span> As ye han
herd, and mete and drynke he hadde  
<span id="an_2421"></span> So smal that wel unnethe it may suffise,  
<span id="an_2422"></span> And therwithal it was ful povre and badde.  
<span id="an_2423"></span> And on a day bifil that in that hour  
<span id="an_2424"></span> Whan that his mete wont was to be broght,  
<span id="an_2425"></span> The gayler shette the dores of the tour.  
<span id="an_2426"></span> He herde it wel, but he spak right noght,  
<span id="an_2427"></span> And in his herte anon ther fil a thoght  
<span id="an_2428"></span> That they for hunger wolde doon hym dyen.  
<span id="an_2429"></span> "Allas!" quod he, "Allas, that I was
wroght!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2430">2430</span></span> Therwith
the teeris fillen from his yen.  
<span id="an_2431"></span> His yonge sone, that thre yeer was of age,  
<span id="an_2432"></span> Unto hym seyde, "Fader, why do ye wepe?  
<span id="an_2433"></span> Whanne wol the gayler bryngen oure potage?  
<span id="an_2434"></span> Is ther no morsel breed that ye do kepe?  
<span id="an_2435"></span> I am so hungry that I may nat slepe.  
<span id="an_2436"></span> Now wolde God that I myghte slepen evere!  
<span id="an_2437"></span> Thanne sholde nat hunger in my wombe crepe;  
<span id="an_2438"></span> Ther is no thyng, but breed, that me were
levere."  
<span id="an_2439"></span> Thus day by day this child bigan to crye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2440">2440</span></span> Til in his
fadres barm adoun it lay,  
<span id="an_2441"></span> And seyde, "Farewel, fader, I moot dye!"  
<span id="an_2442"></span> And kiste his fader, and dyde the same day.  
<span id="an_2443"></span> And whan the woful fader deed it say,  
<span id="an_2444"></span> For wo his armes two he gan to byte,  
<span id="an_2445"></span> And seyde, "Allas, Fortune, and weylaway!  
<span id="an_2446"></span> Thy false wheel my wo al may I wyte."  
<span id="an_2447"></span> His children wende that it for hunger was  
<span id="an_2448"></span> That he his armes gnow, and nat for wo,  
<span id="an_2449"></span> And seyde, "Fader, do nat so, allas!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2450">2450</span></span> But rather
ete the flessh upon us two.  
<span id="an_2451"></span> Oure flessh thou yaf us, take oure flessh us
fro,  
<span id="an_2452"></span> And ete ynogh" -- right thus they to hym
seyde,  
<span id="an_2453"></span> And after that, withinne a day or two,  
<span id="an_2454"></span> They leyde hem in his lappe adoun and
deyde.  
<span id="an_2455"></span> Hymself, despeired, eek for hunger starf;  
<span id="an_2456"></span> Thus ended is this myghty Erl of Pize.  
<span id="an_2457"></span> From heigh estaat Fortune awey hym carf.  
<span id="an_2458"></span> Of this tragedie it oghte ynough suffise;  
<span id="an_2459"></span> Whoso wol here it in a lenger wise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2460">2460</span></span> Redeth the
grete poete of Ytaille  
<span id="an_2461"></span> That highte Dant, for he kan al devyse  
<span id="an_2462"></span> Fro point to point; nat o word wol he
faille.  
<span id="an_2463"></span> Although that Nero were as vicius  
<span id="an_2464"></span> As any feend that lith ful lowe adoun,  
<span id="an_2465"></span> Yet he, as telleth us Swetonius,  
<span id="an_2466"></span> This wyde world hadde in subjeccioun,  
<span id="an_2467"></span> Bothe est and west, \[south\], and
septemtrioun.  
<span id="an_2468"></span> Of rubies, saphires, and of peerles white  
<span id="an_2469"></span> Were alle his clothes brouded up and doun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2470">2470</span></span> For he in
gemmes greetly gan delite.  
<span id="an_2471"></span> Moore delicaat, moore pompous of array,  
<span id="an_2472"></span> Moore proud was nevere emperour than he;  
<span id="an_2473"></span> That ilke clooth that he hadde wered o day,  
<span id="an_2474"></span> After that tyme he nolde it nevere see.  
<span id="an_2475"></span> Nettes of gold threed hadde he greet
plentee  
<span id="an_2476"></span> To fisshe in Tybre, whan hym liste pleye.  
<span id="an_2477"></span> His lustes were al lawe in his decree,  
<span id="an_2478"></span> For Fortune as his freend hym wolde obeye.  
<span id="an_2479"></span> He Rome brende for his delicasie;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2480">2480</span></span> The
senatours he slow upon a day  
<span id="an_2481"></span> To heere how that men wolde wepe and crie;  
<span id="an_2482"></span> And slow his brother, and by his suster
lay.  
<span id="an_2483"></span> His mooder made he in pitous array,  
<span id="an_2484"></span> For he hire wombe slitte to biholde  
<span id="an_2485"></span> Where he conceyved was -- so weilaway  
<span id="an_2486"></span> That he so litel of his mooder tolde!  
<span id="an_2487"></span> No teere out of his eyen for that sighte  
<span id="an_2488"></span> Ne cam, but seyde, "A fair womman was she!"  
<span id="an_2489"></span> Greet wonder is how that he koude or myghte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2490">2490</span></span> Be domesman
of hire dede beautee.  
<span id="an_2491"></span> The wyn to bryngen hym comanded he,  
<span id="an_2492"></span> And drank anon -- noon oother wo he made.  
<span id="an_2493"></span> Whan myght is joyned unto crueltee,  
<span id="an_2494"></span> Allas, to depe wol the venym wade!  
<span id="an_2495"></span> In yowthe a maister hadde this emperour  
<span id="an_2496"></span> To teche hym letterure and curteisye,  
<span id="an_2497"></span> For of moralitee he was the flour,  
<span id="an_2498"></span> As in his tyme, but if bookes lye;  
<span id="an_2499"></span> And whil this maister hadde of hym
maistrye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2500">2500</span></span> He maked
hym so konnyng and so sowple  
<span id="an_2501"></span> That longe tyme it was er tirannye  
<span id="an_2502"></span> Or any vice dorste on hym uncowple.  
<span id="an_2503"></span> This Seneca, of which that I devyse,  
<span id="an_2504"></span> By cause Nero hadde of hym swich drede,  
<span id="an_2505"></span> For he fro vices wolde hym ay chastise  
<span id="an_2506"></span> Discreetly, as by word and nat by dede --  
<span id="an_2507"></span> "Sire," wolde he seyn, "an emperour moot
nede  
<span id="an_2508"></span> Be vertuous and hate tirannye --"  
<span id="an_2509"></span> For which he in a bath made hym to blede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2510">2510</span></span> On bothe
his armes, til he moste dye.  
<span id="an_2511"></span> This Nero hadde eek of acustumaunce  
<span id="an_2512"></span> In youthe agayns his maister for to ryse,  
<span id="an_2513"></span> Which afterward hym thoughte a greet
grevaunce;  
<span id="an_2514"></span> Therefore he made hym dyen in this wise.  
<span id="an_2515"></span> But natheless this Seneca the wise  
<span id="an_2516"></span> Chees in a bath to dye in this manere  
<span id="an_2517"></span> Rather than han another tormentise;  
<span id="an_2518"></span> And thus hath Nero slayn his maister deere.  
<span id="an_2519"></span> Now fil it so that Fortune liste no lenger  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2520">2520</span></span> The hye
pryde of Nero to cherice,  
<span id="an_2521"></span> For though that he were strong, yet was she
strenger.  
<span id="an_2522"></span> She thoughte thus: "By God! I am to nyce  
<span id="an_2523"></span> To sette a man that is fulfild of vice  
<span id="an_2524"></span> In heigh degree, and emperour hym calle.  
<span id="an_2525"></span> By God, out of his sete I wol hym trice;  
<span id="an_2526"></span> Whan he leest weneth, sonnest shal he
falle."  
<span id="an_2527"></span> The peple roos upon hym on a nyght  
<span id="an_2528"></span> For his defaute, and whan he it espied,  
<span id="an_2529"></span> Out of his dores anon he hath hym dight  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2530">2530</span></span> Allone, and
ther he wende han been allied  
<span id="an_2531"></span> He knokked faste, and ay the moore he cried  
<span id="an_2532"></span> The fastere shette they the dores alle.  
<span id="an_2533"></span> Tho wiste he wel, he hadde himself mysgyed,  
<span id="an_2534"></span> And wente his wey; no lenger dorste he
calle.  
<span id="an_2535"></span> The peple cried and rombled up and doun,  
<span id="an_2536"></span> That with his erys herde he how they seyde,  
<span id="an_2537"></span> "Where is this false tiraunt, this Neroun?"  
<span id="an_2538"></span> For fere almoost out of his wit he breyde,  
<span id="an_2539"></span> And to his goddes pitously he preyde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2540">2540</span></span> For socour,
but it myghte nat bityde.  
<span id="an_2541"></span> For drede of this hym thoughte that he
deyde,  
<span id="an_2542"></span> And ran into a gardyn hym to hyde.  
<span id="an_2543"></span> And in this gardyn foond he cherles tweye  
<span id="an_2544"></span> That seten by a fyr, greet and reed.  
<span id="an_2545"></span> And to thise cherles two he gan to preye  
<span id="an_2546"></span> To sleen hym and to girden of his heed,  
<span id="an_2547"></span> That to his body, whan that he were deed,  
<span id="an_2548"></span> Were no despit ydoon for his defame.  
<span id="an_2549"></span> Hymself he slow, he koude no bettre reed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2550">2550</span></span> Of which
Fortune lough, and hadde a game.  
<span id="an_2551"></span> Was nevere capitayn under a kyng  
<span id="an_2552"></span> That regnes mo putte in subjeccioun,  
<span id="an_2553"></span> Ne strenger was in feeld of alle thyng,  
<span id="an_2554"></span> As in his tyme, ne gretter of renoun,  
<span id="an_2555"></span> Ne moore pompous in heigh presumpcioun  
<span id="an_2556"></span> Than Oloferne, which Fortune ay kiste  
<span id="an_2557"></span> So likerously, and ladde hym up and doun  
<span id="an_2558"></span> Til that his heed was of, er that he wiste.  
<span id="an_2559"></span> Nat oonly that this world hadde hym in awe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2560">2560</span></span> For lesynge
of richesse or libertee,  
<span id="an_2561"></span> But he made every man reneyen his lawe.  
<span id="an_2562"></span> "Nabugodonosor was god," seyde hee;  
<span id="an_2563"></span> "Noon oother god sholde adoured bee."  
<span id="an_2564"></span> Agayns his heeste no wight dorst trespace,  
<span id="an_2565"></span> Save in Bethulia, a strong citee,  
<span id="an_2566"></span> Where Eliachim a preest was of that place.  
<span id="an_2567"></span> But taak kep of the deth of Oloferne:  
<span id="an_2568"></span> Amydde his hoost he dronke lay a-nyght,  
<span id="an_2569"></span> Withinne his tente, large as is a berne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2570">2570</span></span> And yet,
for al his pompe and al his myght,  
<span id="an_2571"></span> Judith, a womman, as he lay upright  
<span id="an_2572"></span> Slepynge, his heed of smoot, and from his
tente  
<span id="an_2573"></span> Ful pryvely she stal from every wight,  
<span id="an_2574"></span> And with his heed unto hir toun she wente.  
<span id="an_2575"></span> What nedeth it of kyng Anthiochus  
<span id="an_2576"></span> To telle his hye roial magestee,  
<span id="an_2577"></span> His hye pride, his werkes venymus?  
<span id="an_2578"></span> For swich another was ther noon as he.  
<span id="an_2579"></span> Rede which that he was in Machabee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2580">2580</span></span> And rede
the proude wordes that he seyde,  
<span id="an_2581"></span> And why he fil fro heigh prosperitee,  
<span id="an_2582"></span> And in an hill how wrecchedly he deyde.  
<span id="an_2583"></span> Fortune hym hadde enhaunced so in pride  
<span id="an_2584"></span> That verraily he wende he myghte attayne  
<span id="an_2585"></span> Unto the sterres upon every syde,  
<span id="an_2586"></span> And in balance weyen ech montayne,  
<span id="an_2587"></span> And alle the floodes of the see restrayne.  
<span id="an_2588"></span> And Goddes peple hadde he moost in hate;  
<span id="an_2589"></span> Hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2590">2590</span></span> Wenynge
that God ne myghte his pride abate.  
<span id="an_2591"></span> And for that Nichanore and Thymothee  
<span id="an_2592"></span> Of Jewes weren venquysshed myghtily,  
<span id="an_2593"></span> Unto the Jewes swich an hate hadde he  
<span id="an_2594"></span> That he bad greithen his chaar ful hastily,  
<span id="an_2595"></span> And swoor, and seyde ful despitously  
<span id="an_2596"></span> Unto Jerusalem he wolde eftsoone  
<span id="an_2597"></span> To wreken his ire on it ful cruelly;  
<span id="an_2598"></span> But of his purpos he was let ful soone.  
<span id="an_2599"></span> God for his manace hym so soore smoot  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2600">2600</span></span> With
invisible wounde, ay incurable,  
<span id="an_2601"></span> That in his guttes carf it so and boot  
<span id="an_2602"></span> That his peynes weren importable.  
<span id="an_2603"></span> And certeinly the wreche was resonable,  
<span id="an_2604"></span> For many a mannes guttes dide he peyne.  
<span id="an_2605"></span> But from his purpos cursed and dampnable,  
<span id="an_2606"></span> For al his smert, he wolde hym nat
restreyne,  
<span id="an_2607"></span> But bad anon apparaillen his hoost;  
<span id="an_2608"></span> And sodeynly, er he was of it war,  
<span id="an_2609"></span> God daunted al his pride and al his boost.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2610">2610</span></span> For he so
soore fil out of his char  
<span id="an_2611"></span> That it his limes and his skyn totar,  
<span id="an_2612"></span> So that he neyther myghte go ne ryde,  
<span id="an_2613"></span> But in a chayer men aboute hym bar,  
<span id="an_2614"></span> Al forbrused, bothe bak and syde.  
<span id="an_2615"></span> The wreche of God hym smoot so cruelly  
<span id="an_2616"></span> That thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte,  
<span id="an_2617"></span> And therwithal he stank so horribly  
<span id="an_2618"></span> That noon of al his meynee that hym kepte,  
<span id="an_2619"></span> Wheither so he wook or ellis slepte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2620">2620</span></span> Ne myghte
noght the stynk of hym endure.  
<span id="an_2621"></span> In this meschief he wayled and eek wepte,  
<span id="an_2622"></span> And knew God lord of every creature.  
<span id="an_2623"></span> To al his hoost and to hymself also  
<span id="an_2624"></span> Ful wlatsom was the stynk of his careyne;  
<span id="an_2625"></span> No man ne myghte hym bere to ne fro.  
<span id="an_2626"></span> And in this stynk and this horrible peyne,  
<span id="an_2627"></span> He starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne.  
<span id="an_2628"></span> Thus hath this robbour and this homycide,  
<span id="an_2629"></span> That many a man made to wepe and pleyne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2630">2630</span></span> Swich
gerdoun as bilongeth unto pryde.  
<span id="an_2631"></span> The storie of Alisaundre is so commune  
<span id="an_2632"></span> That every wight that hath discrecioun  
<span id="an_2633"></span> Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune.  
<span id="an_2634"></span> This wyde world, as in conclusioun,  
<span id="an_2635"></span> He wan by strengthe, or for his hye renoun  
<span id="an_2636"></span> They weren glad for pees unto hym sende.  
<span id="an_2637"></span> The pride of man and beest he leyde adoun,  
<span id="an_2638"></span> Wherso he cam, unto the worldes ende.  
<span id="an_2639"></span> Comparisoun myghte nevere yet been maked  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2640">2640</span></span> Bitwixe hym
and another conquerour;  
<span id="an_2641"></span> For al this world for drede of hym hath
quaked.  
<span id="an_2642"></span> He was of knyghthod and of fredom flour;  
<span id="an_2643"></span> Fortune hym made the heir of hire honour.  
<span id="an_2644"></span> Save wyn and wommen, no thing myghte aswage  
<span id="an_2645"></span> His hye entente in armes and labour,  
<span id="an_2646"></span> So was he ful of leonyn corage.  
<span id="an_2647"></span> What pris were it to hym, though I yow
tolde  
<span id="an_2648"></span> Of Darius, and an hundred thousand mo  
<span id="an_2649"></span> Of kynges, princes, dukes, erles bolde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2650">2650</span></span> Whiche he
conquered, and broghte hem into wo?  
<span id="an_2651"></span> I seye, as fer as man may ryde or go,  
<span id="an_2652"></span> The world was his -- what sholde I moore
devyse?  
<span id="an_2653"></span> For though I write or tolde yow everemo  
<span id="an_2654"></span> Of his knyghthod, it myghte nat suffise.  
<span id="an_2655"></span> Twelf yeer he regned, as seith Machabee.  
<span id="an_2656"></span> Philippes sone of Macidoyne he was,  
<span id="an_2657"></span> That first was kyng in Grece the contree.  
<span id="an_2658"></span> O worthy, gentil Alisandre, allas,  
<span id="an_2659"></span> That evere sholde fallen swich a cas!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2660">2660</span></span> Empoysoned
of thyn owene folk thou weere;  
<span id="an_2661"></span> Thy sys Fortune hath turned into aas,  
<span id="an_2662"></span> And for thee ne weep she never a teere.  
<span id="an_2663"></span> Who shal me yeven teeris to compleyne  
<span id="an_2664"></span> The deeth of gentillesse and of franchise,  
<span id="an_2665"></span> That al the world weelded in his demeyne,  
<span id="an_2666"></span> And yet hym thoughte it myghte nat suffise?  
<span id="an_2667"></span> So ful was his corage of heigh emprise.  
<span id="an_2668"></span> Allas, who shal me helpe to endite  
<span id="an_2669"></span> False Fortune, and poyson to despise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2670">2670</span></span> The whiche
two of al this wo I wyte?  
<span id="an_2671"></span> By wisedom, manhede, and by greet labour,  
<span id="an_2672"></span> From humble bed to roial magestee  
<span id="an_2673"></span> Up roos he Julius, the conquerour,  
<span id="an_2674"></span> That wan al th' occident by land and see,  
<span id="an_2675"></span> By strengthe of hand, or elles by tretee,  
<span id="an_2676"></span> And unto Rome made hem tributarie;  
<span id="an_2677"></span> And sitthe of Rome the emperour was he  
<span id="an_2678"></span> Til that Fortune weex his adversarie.  
<span id="an_2679"></span> O myghty Cesar, that in Thessalie  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2680">2680</span></span> Agayn
Pompeus, fader thyn in lawe,  
<span id="an_2681"></span> That of the orient hadde al the chivalrie  
<span id="an_2682"></span> As fer as that the day bigynneth dawe,  
<span id="an_2683"></span> Thou thurgh thy knyghthod hast hem take and
slawe,  
<span id="an_2684"></span> Save fewe folk that with Pompeus fledde,  
<span id="an_2685"></span> Thurgh which thou puttest al th' orient in
awe.  
<span id="an_2686"></span> Thanke Fortune, that so wel thee spedde!  
<span id="an_2687"></span> But now a litel while I wol biwaille  
<span id="an_2688"></span> This Pompeus, this noble governour  
<span id="an_2689"></span> Of Rome, which that fleigh at this
bataille.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2690">2690</span></span> I seye, oon
of his men, a fals traitour,  
<span id="an_2691"></span> His heed of smoot, to wynnen hym favour  
<span id="an_2692"></span> Of Julius, and hym the heed he broghte.  
<span id="an_2693"></span> Allas, Pompeye, of th' orient conquerour,  
<span id="an_2694"></span> That Fortune unto swich a fyn thee broghte!  
<span id="an_2695"></span> To Rome agayn repaireth Julius  
<span id="an_2696"></span> With his triumphe, lauriat ful hye;  
<span id="an_2697"></span> But on a tyme Brutus Cassius,  
<span id="an_2698"></span> That evere hadde of his hye estaat envye,  
<span id="an_2699"></span> Ful prively hath maad conspiracye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2700">2700</span></span> Agayns this
Julius in subtil wise,  
<span id="an_2701"></span> And caste the place in which he sholde dye  
<span id="an_2702"></span> With boydekyns, as I shal yow devyse.  
<span id="an_2703"></span> This Julius to the Capitolie wente  
<span id="an_2704"></span> Upon a day, as he was wont to goon,  
<span id="an_2705"></span> And in the Capitolie anon hym hente  
<span id="an_2706"></span> This false Brutus and his othere foon,  
<span id="an_2707"></span> And stiked hym with boydekyns anoon  
<span id="an_2708"></span> With many a wounde, and thus they lete hym
lye;  
<span id="an_2709"></span> But nevere gronte he at no strook but oon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2710">2710</span></span> Or elles at
two, but if his storie lye.  
<span id="an_2711"></span> So manly was this Julius of herte,  
<span id="an_2712"></span> And so wel lovede estaatly honestee,  
<span id="an_2713"></span> That though his deedly woundes soore
smerte,  
<span id="an_2714"></span> His mantel over his hypes caste he,  
<span id="an_2715"></span> For no man sholde seen his privetee;  
<span id="an_2716"></span> And as he lay of diyng in a traunce,  
<span id="an_2717"></span> And wiste verraily that deed was hee,  
<span id="an_2718"></span> Of honestee yet hadde he remembraunce.  
<span id="an_2719"></span> Lucan, to thee this storie I recomende,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2720">2720</span></span> And to
Swetoun, and to Valerius also,  
<span id="an_2721"></span> That of this storie writen word and ende,  
<span id="an_2722"></span> How that to thise grete conqueroures two  
<span id="an_2723"></span> Fortune was first freend, and sitthe foo.  
<span id="an_2724"></span> No man ne truste upon hire favour longe,  
<span id="an_2725"></span> But have hire in awayt for everemoo;  
<span id="an_2726"></span> Witnesse on alle thise conqueroures
stronge.  
<span id="an_2727"></span> This riche Cresus, whilom kyng of Lyde,  
<span id="an_2728"></span> Of which Cresus Cirus soore hym dradde,  
<span id="an_2729"></span> Yet was he caught amyddes al his pryde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2730">2730</span></span> And to be
brent men to the fyr hym ladde.  
<span id="an_2731"></span> But swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde  
<span id="an_2732"></span> That slow the fyr, and made hym to escape;  
<span id="an_2733"></span> But to be war no grace yet he hadde,  
<span id="an_2734"></span> Til Fortune on the galwes made hym gape.  
<span id="an_2735"></span> Whanne he escaped was, he kan nat stente  
<span id="an_2736"></span> For to bigynne a newe werre agayn.  
<span id="an_2737"></span> He wende wel, for that Fortune hym sente  
<span id="an_2738"></span> Swich hap that he escaped thurgh the rayn,  
<span id="an_2739"></span> That of his foos he myghte nat be slayn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2740">2740</span></span> And eek a
sweven upon a nyght he mette,  
<span id="an_2741"></span> Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn  
<span id="an_2742"></span> That in vengeance he al his herte sette.  
<span id="an_2743"></span> Upon a tree he was, as that hym thoughte,  
<span id="an_2744"></span> Ther Juppiter hym wessh, bothe bak and
syde,  
<span id="an_2745"></span> And Phebus eek a fair towaille hym broughte  
<span id="an_2746"></span> To dryen hym with; and therfore wax his

<span id="an_2747"></span> And to his doghter, that stood hym bisyde,  
<span id="an_2748"></span> Which that he knew in heigh sentence

<span id="an_2749"></span> He bad hire telle hym what it signyfyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2750">2750</span></span> And she his

<span id="an_2751"></span> "The tree," quod she, "the galwes is to

<span id="an_2752"></span> And Juppiter bitokneth snow and reyn,

<span id="an_2755"></span> Thou shalt anhanged be, fader, certeyn;

<span id="an_2757"></span> Thus warned hym ful plat and ek ful pleyn  
<span id="an_2758"></span> His doghter, which that called was Phanye.  
<span id="an_2759"></span> Anhanged was Cresus, the proude kyng;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2760">2760</span></span> His roial
