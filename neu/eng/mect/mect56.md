### Book 4

<span id="an_1"></span> Whanne Philosophie hadde songen softly  
<span id="an_2"></span> and delitably the forseide thinges, kepynge
the  
<span id="an_3"></span> dignyte of hir cheere and the weyghte of hir  
<span id="an_4"></span> wordes, I, thanne, that ne hadde nat al
outrely  
<span id="an_5"></span> foryeten the wepynge and the moornynge that  
<span id="an_6"></span> was set in myn herte, forbrak the entencioun
of  
<span id="an_7"></span> hir that entendede yit to seyn some othere  
<span id="an_8"></span> thinges. "O," quod I, "thou that art gyderesse  
<span id="an_9"></span> of verray light, the thinges that thou hast  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> seid me hidirto
ben to me so cleer and so  
<span id="an_11"></span> schewynge by the devyne lookynge of hem,  
<span id="an_12"></span> and by thy resouns, that they ne mowen nat  
<span id="an_13"></span> ben overcomen. And thilke thinges that thou  
<span id="an_14"></span> toldest me, al be it so that I hadde whilom
foryeten  
<span id="an_15"></span> hem for the sorwe of the wrong that hath  
<span id="an_16"></span> ben don to me, yet nathales thei ne weren not  
<span id="an_17"></span> al outrely unknowen to me. But this same is  
<span id="an_18"></span> namely a ryght gret cause of my sorwe: that
so  
<span id="an_19"></span> as the governour of thinges is good, yif  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> that eveles
mowen ben by any weyes,  
<span id="an_21"></span> or elles yif that evelis passen withouten  
<span id="an_22"></span> punysschynge. The whiche thing oonly, how  
<span id="an_23"></span> worthy it es to ben wondrid uppon, thou
considerest  
<span id="an_24"></span> it wel thiselve certeynly. But yit to this  
<span id="an_25"></span> thing ther is yit another thing ijoyned more
to  
<span id="an_26"></span> ben wondrid uppon: for felonye is emperisse,  
<span id="an_27"></span> and floureth ful of richesses, and vertu nis
nat al  
<span id="an_28"></span> oonly withouten meedes, but it is cast undir  
<span id="an_29"></span> and fortroden undir the feet of felenous  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> folk, and it
abyeth the tormentz in stede of  
<span id="an_31"></span> wikkide felouns. Of alle whiche thinges  
<span id="an_32"></span> ther nys no wyght that may merveillen ynowghe  
<span id="an_33"></span> ne compleyne that swiche thinges ben don in  
<span id="an_34"></span> the reigne of God, that alle things woot and  
<span id="an_35"></span> alle thinges may and ne wole nat but only  
<span id="an_36"></span> gode thinges."  
<span id="an_37"></span> Thanne seide sche thus: "Certes," quod sche,  
<span id="an_38"></span> "that were a greet merveille and an
abaysschinge  
<span id="an_39"></span> withouten ende, and wel more horrible than  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> alle monstres,
yif it were as thou wenest;  
<span id="an_41"></span> that is to seyn, that in the ryght ordene  
<span id="an_42"></span> hous of so mochel a fadir and an ordeynour of  
<span id="an_43"></span> meyne, that the vesselis that ben foule and
vyl  
<span id="an_44"></span> schulden ben honoured and heryed, and the  
<span id="an_45"></span> precious vesselis schulden ben defouled and  
<span id="an_46"></span> vyl. But it nys nat so. For yif the thinges
that  
<span id="an_47"></span> I have concluded a litel herebyforn ben kept  
<span id="an_48"></span> hoole and unaraced, thou schalt wel knowe by  
<span id="an_49"></span> the auctorite of God, of the whos reigne I  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> speke, that
certes the gode folk ben alwey  
<span id="an_51"></span> myghty and schrewes ben alwey outcast  
<span id="an_52"></span> and feble; ne the vices ben neveremo
withouten  
<span id="an_53"></span> peyne, ne the vertus ne ben nat withouten  
<span id="an_54"></span> mede; and that blisfulnesses comen alwey  
<span id="an_55"></span> to good folk, and infortune comith alwey to  
<span id="an_56"></span> wykkide folk. And thou schalt wel knowe  
<span id="an_57"></span> manye thinges of this kynde, that schullen  
<span id="an_58"></span> cesen thi pleyntis and strengthen the with
stedfaste  
<span id="an_59"></span> sadnesse. And for thou hast seyn the  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> forme of the
verray blisfulnesse by me that  
<span id="an_61"></span> have whilom yschewid it the, and thow  
<span id="an_62"></span> hast knowen in whom blisfulnesse is yset,
alle  
<span id="an_63"></span> thingis ytreted that I trowe ben necessarie
to  
<span id="an_64"></span> putten forth, I schal schewe the the weye
that  
<span id="an_65"></span> schal bryngen the ayen unto thyn hous; and I  
<span id="an_66"></span> schal fycchen fetheris in thi thought, by
whiche  
<span id="an_67"></span> it mai arisen in heighte; so that, alle
tribulacioun  
<span id="an_68"></span> idon awey, thow, by my gyding and by  
<span id="an_69"></span> my path and by my sledys, shalt mowen  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> retourne hool
and sownd into thi contree.  
<span id="an_1"></span> "I have, forthi, swifte fetheris that
surmounten  
<span id="an_2"></span> the heighte of the hevene. Whanne  
<span id="an_3"></span> the swift thoght hath clothid itself in tho  
<span id="an_4"></span> fetheris, it despiseth the hateful erthes, and
surmounteth  
<span id="an_5"></span> the rowndenesse of the gret ayr; and  
<span id="an_6"></span> it seth the clowdes byhynde his bak, and
passeth  
<span id="an_7"></span> the heighte of the regioun of the fir, that  
<span id="an_8"></span> eschaufeth by the swifte moevynge of the
firmament,  
<span id="an_9"></span> til that he areyseth hym into the  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> houses that
beren the sterres, and joyneth  
<span id="an_11"></span> his weies with the sonne, Phebus, and  
<span id="an_12"></span> felawschipeth the weie of the olde colde
Saturnus;  
<span id="an_13"></span> and he, imaked a knyght of the clere  
<span id="an_14"></span> sterre (that is to seyn, whan the thought is  
<span id="an_15"></span> makid Godis knyght by the sekynge of  
<span id="an_16"></span> trouthe to comen to the verray knowleche of  
<span id="an_17"></span> God) -- and thilke soule renneth by the
cercle  
<span id="an_18"></span> of the sterres in alle the places there as
the  
<span id="an_19"></span> schynynge nyght is ypainted (that is to  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> sey, the nyght
that is cloudeles; for on  
<span id="an_21"></span> nyghtes that ben cloudeles it semeth as  
<span id="an_22"></span> the hevene were peynted with diverse ymages  
<span id="an_23"></span> of sterres). And whan \[that\] he hath gon
there  
<span id="an_24"></span> inoghe, he schal forleten the laste point of
the  
<span id="an_25"></span> hevene, and he schal pressen and wenden on  
<span id="an_26"></span> the bak of the swifte firmament, and he schal  
<span id="an_27"></span> be makid parfit of the worschipful lyght
\[or\]  
<span id="an_28"></span> dredefulle clerenesse of God. There halt the  
<span id="an_29"></span> lord of kynges the septre of his myght and  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> atemprith the
governementz of the world,  
<span id="an_31"></span> and the schynynge juge of thinges, stable in  
<span id="an_32"></span> hymself, governeth the swifte cart or wayn
(that  
<span id="an_33"></span> is to seyn, the circuler moevynge of the
sonne).  
<span id="an_34"></span> And yif thi wey ledeth the ayein so that thou
be  
<span id="an_35"></span> brought thider, thanne wiltow seye now that  
<span id="an_36"></span> that is the contre that thou requerist, of
whiche  
<span id="an_37"></span> thow ne haddest no mynde -- \`but now it  
<span id="an_38"></span> remembreth me wel, here was I born, her wol  
<span id="an_39"></span> I fastne my degree, here wol I duelle.' But  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> yif the liketh
thanne to looken on the  
<span id="an_41"></span> derknesse of the erthe that thou hast  
<span id="an_42"></span> forleten, thanne shaltow seen that these
felonus  
<span id="an_43"></span> tirantz, that the wrecchide peple dredeth
now,  
<span id="an_44"></span> schullen ben exiled fro thilke faire contre."  
<span id="an_1"></span> Thanne seide I thus: "Owh! I wondre me  
<span id="an_2"></span> that thow byhetist me so grete thinges. Ne I  
<span id="an_3"></span> ne doute nat that thou ne maist wel parforme  
<span id="an_4"></span> that thow behetist; but I preie the oonly
this,  
<span id="an_5"></span> that thow ne tarie nat to telle me thilke
thinges  
<span id="an_6"></span> that thou hast moevid."  
<span id="an_7"></span> "First," quod sche, "thow most nedes knowen  
<span id="an_8"></span> that good folk ben alwey strong and myghti,  
<span id="an_9"></span> and the schrewes ben feble and desert and  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> naked of alle
strengthes. And of thise  
<span id="an_11"></span> thinges, certes, everiche of hem is declared  
<span id="an_12"></span> and schewed by other. For so as good and  
<span id="an_13"></span> yvel ben two contraries, yif so be that good
be  
<span id="an_14"></span> stedfast, thanne scheweth the feblesse of
yvel  
<span id="an_15"></span> al opynly; and yif thow knowe clerly the
freelnesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70-ch">70-ch</span></span> 16 of
yvel, the stedfastnesse of good is  
<span id="an_17"></span> knowen. But for as moche as the fey of my  
<span id="an_18"></span> sentence schal ben the more ferme and
haboundant,  
<span id="an_19"></span> I wil gon by the to weye and by the  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> tothir, and I
wil conferme the thinges that  
<span id="an_21"></span> ben purposed, now on this side and now on  
<span id="an_22"></span> that side.  
<span id="an_23"></span> "Two thinges ther ben in whiche the effect of  
<span id="an_24"></span> alle the dedes of mankynde standeth (that is
to  
<span id="an_25"></span> seyn, wil and power); and yif that oon of
thise  
<span id="an_26"></span> two faileth, ther nys nothing that may be
doon.  
<span id="an_27"></span> For yif that wille lakketh, ther nys no wyght
that  
<span id="an_28"></span> undirtaketh to done that he wol nat doon; and  
<span id="an_29"></span> yif power faileth, the wil nys but in idel
and  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> stant for
naught. And therof cometh it that  
<span id="an_31"></span> yif thou see a wyght that wolde geten that  
<span id="an_32"></span> he mai not geten, thow maist nat douten that  
<span id="an_33"></span> power ne faileth hym to have that he wolde."  
<span id="an_34"></span> "This is open and cler," quod I, "ne it ne
mai  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70-ch">70-ch</span></span> 35 nat be
denyed in no manere."  
<span id="an_36"></span> "And yif thou se a wyght," quod sche, "that  
<span id="an_37"></span> hath doon that he wolde doon, thow nilt nat  
<span id="an_38"></span> douten that he ne hath had power to doon it?"  
<span id="an_39"></span> "No," quod I.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> "And in that
that every wyght may, in  
<span id="an_41"></span> that men may holden hym myghti. (As  
<span id="an_42"></span> who seith, in so moche as a man is myghty to  
<span id="an_43"></span> doon a thing, in so mochel men halt hym  
<span id="an_44"></span> myghti.) And in that that he ne mai, in that
men  
<span id="an_45"></span> demen hym to ben feble."  
<span id="an_46"></span> "I confesse it wel," quod I.  
<span id="an_47"></span> "Remembreth the," quod sche, "that I have  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70-ch">70-ch</span></span> 48
gaderid and ischewid by forseide resouns that al

<span id="an_54"></span> "And recordeth the nat thanne," quod sche,  
<span id="an_55"></span> "that blisfulnesse is thilke same good that
men  
<span id="an_56"></span> requiren, so that whanne that blisfulnesse is  
<span id="an_57"></span> required of alle, that good also is required
and

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70-ch">70-ch</span></span> 59 "It ne

gretly alwey ficched in my memorie."  
<span id="an_62"></span> "Alle folk thanne," quod sche, "goode and  
<span id="an_63"></span> eek badde, enforcen hem withoute difference
of  
<span id="an_64"></span> entencioun to comen to good."  
<span id="an_65"></span> "This is a verray consequence," quod I.  
<span id="an_66"></span> "And certein is," quod sche, "that by the  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70-ch">70-ch</span></span> 67
getynge of good ben men ymakid gode."  
<span id="an_68"></span> "This is certein," quod I.  
<span id="an_69"></span> "Thanne geten gode men that thei desiren?"  
<span id="an_71"></span> "So semeth it," quod I.  
<span id="an_72"></span> "But wikkide folk," quod sche, "yif thei

<span id="an_74"></span> ben wikkid."  
<span id="an_75"></span> "So is it," quod I.  
<span id="an_76"></span> "Than so as the ton and the tothir," quod  
<span id="an_77"></span> sche, "desiren good, and the gode folk geten  
<span id="an_78"></span> good and not the wikkide folk, than is it no  
<span id="an_79"></span> doute that the gode folk ne ben myghty  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> and wikkid folk

<span id="an_81"></span> "Whoso that evere," quod I, "douteth  
<span id="an_82"></span> of this, he ne mai nat considere the nature
of  
<span id="an_83"></span> thinges ne the consequence of resouns."  
<span id="an_84"></span> "And over this," quod sche, "if that ther ben

that

<span id="an_245"></span> "And yit to proeve this conclusioun ther  
<span id="an_246"></span> helpeth me this, that I have schewed
herebyforn,  
<span id="an_247"></span> that alle power is to be noumbred among  
<span id="an_248"></span> thinges that men oughten requere; and I have  
<span id="an_249"></span> schewed that alle thinges that oughten ben  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> desired ben
referred to good, ryght as to a  
<span id="an_251"></span> maner heighte of hir nature. But for to  
<span id="an_252"></span> mowen don yvel and felonye ne mai nat ben  
<span id="an_253"></span> referrid to good; thanne nys nat yvel of the

<span id="an_255"></span> But alle power aughte ben desired and
requerid;  
<span id="an_256"></span> thanne is it open and cler that the power ne

<span id="an_257"></span> mowynge of schrewes nis no power.  
<span id="an_258"></span> "And of alle thise thinges it scheweth wel
that  
<span id="an_259"></span> the gode folk ben certeinli myghty, and the  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> schrewes
doutelees ben unmyghty. And  
<span id="an_261"></span> it is cler and opene that thilke sentence

thei ne geten ne ateyne nat  
<span id="an_271"></span> therto, for vices ne comen nat to

<span id="an_1"></span> "Whoso that the coverturis of hir veyn

<span id="an_1"></span> "Seestow nat thanne in how greet filthe thise

<span id="an_13"></span> that blisfulnesse is thilke same good for
whiche  
<span id="an_14"></span> that alle thinges ben doon; thanne is thilke  
<span id="an_15"></span> same good purposed to the werkes of mankynde  
<span id="an_16"></span> right as a comune mede, which mede ne

<span id="an_24"></span> coroune of wise men ne schal nat fallen ne

And of what mede schal

<span id="an_42"></span> mede and ryght greet aboven alle medes.
Remembre  
<span id="an_43"></span> the of thilke noble corrolarie that I  
<span id="an_44"></span> yaf the a litel herebyforn, and gadre it
togidre  
<span id="an_45"></span> in this manere: so as good \[hytself\] is
blisfulnesse,  
<span id="an_46"></span> thanne is it cler and certein that alle  
<span id="an_47"></span> gode folk ben imaked blisful for thei ben
gode;  
<span id="an_48"></span> and thilke folk that ben blisful it accordeth
and  
<span id="an_49"></span> is covenable to ben goddes. Thanne is the  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> mede of good
folk swych that no day ne  
<span id="an_51"></span> schal empeiren it, ne no wikkidnesse schal  
<span id="an_52"></span> derkne it, ne power of no wyght ne schal nat  
<span id="an_53"></span> amenusen it; that is to seyn, to ben maked  
<span id="an_54"></span> goddes. And syn it is thus (that gode men ne  
<span id="an_55"></span> failen neveremo of hir mede), certes no wise
man  
<span id="an_56"></span> ne may doute of the undepartable peyne of  
<span id="an_57"></span> schrewes (that is to seyn, that the peyne of  
<span id="an_58"></span> schrewes ne departeth nat from hemself
neveremo).  
<span id="an_59"></span> For so as good and yvel, and peyne and  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> medes, ben
contrarie, it moot nedes ben  
<span id="an_61"></span> that, ryght as we seen betyden in guerdoun  
<span id="an_62"></span> of gode, that also moot the peyne of yvel
answere  
<span id="an_63"></span> by the contrarie partie to schrewes. Now  
<span id="an_64"></span> thanne, so as bounte and pruesse ben the mede  
<span id="an_65"></span> to good folk, also is schrewidnesse itself
torment  
<span id="an_66"></span> to schrewes. Thanne whoso that evere is  
<span id="an_67"></span> entecchid or defouled with peyne, he ne
douteth  
<span id="an_68"></span> nat that he nys entecchid and defouled  
<span id="an_69"></span> with yvel. Yif schrewes thanne wol preysen  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> hemself, may it
semen to hem that thei ben  
<span id="an_71"></span> withouten parti of torment, syn thei ben  
<span id="an_72"></span> swiche that the uttreste wikkidnesse (that is
to  
<span id="an_73"></span> seyn, wikkide thewes, which that is the
uttereste  
<span id="an_74"></span> and the worst kynde of schrewednesse)  
<span id="an_75"></span> ne defouleth ne enteccheth nat hem oonly, but  
<span id="an_76"></span> enfecteth and envenymeth hem greetly? And  
<span id="an_77"></span> also loke on schrewes, that ben the contrarie  
<span id="an_78"></span> partie of gode men, how gret peyne
felawschipith  
<span id="an_79"></span> and folweth hem! For thou hast  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> lerned a litil
herebyforn that alle thing that  
<span id="an_81"></span> is and hath beynge is oon, and thilke same  
<span id="an_82"></span> oon is good: than is this the consequence,
that  
<span id="an_83"></span> it semeth wel that al that is and hath beynge  
<span id="an_84"></span> is good. (This is to seyn, as who seith that  
<span id="an_85"></span> beinge and unite and goodnesse is al oon.)  
<span id="an_86"></span> And in this manere it folweth thanne that
alle  
<span id="an_87"></span> thing that fayleth to ben good, it stynteth
for  
<span id="an_88"></span> to be and for to han any beynge. Wherfore it  
<span id="an_89"></span> es that schrewes stynten for to ben that

But thilke othir forme \[of\] \[the\]  
<span id="an_91"></span> \[body\] of mankynde (that is to seyn, the  
<span id="an_92"></span> \[forme\] withowte) scheweth yit that thise  
<span id="an_93"></span> schrewes weren whilom men. Wherfore, whan  
<span id="an_94"></span> thei ben perverted and turned into malice,  
<span id="an_95"></span> certes, thanne have thei forlorn the nature
of  
<span id="an_96"></span> mankynde. But so as oonly bownte and prowesse  
<span id="an_97"></span> may enhawnsen every man over othere  
<span id="an_98"></span> men, than moot it nedes be that schrewes,  
<span id="an_99"></span> whiche that schrewednesse hath cast out of

<span id="an_108"></span> "For whiche it is that alle thinges that ben

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> purveaunce,
to whiche purveaunce destyne

ryght so  
<span id="an_144"></span> is the ordre of moevable destyne to the

<span id="an_145"></span> symplicite of purveaunce.  
<span id="an_146"></span> "Thilke ordenaunce moveth the hevene and

togidre  
<span id="an_148"></span> amonges hemself, and transformeth hem by

herof is don this noble miracle

<span id="an_224"></span> "But for to constreyne (as who seith, but
for

of

purveaunce, that al woot. And  
<span id="an_231"></span> Lucan, my famylier, telleth that the

<span id="an_234"></span> whatsoevere thou mayst seen that is doon in
this  
<span id="an_235"></span> world unhopid or unwened, certes it es the  
<span id="an_236"></span> ryghte ordre of thinges, but as to thi
wikkid  
<span id="an_237"></span> opynioun it is a confusioun. But I suppose
that  
<span id="an_238"></span> som man be so wel ithewed that the devyne  
<span id="an_239"></span> jugement and the jugement of mankynde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> accorden hem
togidre of hym; but he is so  
<span id="an_241"></span> unstidfast of corage that, yif any adversite  
<span id="an_242"></span> come to hym, he wol forleten peraventure to  
<span id="an_243"></span> continue innocence by the whiche he ne may  
<span id="an_244"></span> nat withholden fortune. Thanne the wise  
<span id="an_245"></span> dispensacion of God sparith hym, the whiche  
<span id="an_246"></span> man adversite myghte enpeyren; for that God  
<span id="an_247"></span> wol nat suffren hym to travaile to whom that  
<span id="an_248"></span> travaile nis nat covenable. Anothir man is
parfit  
<span id="an_249"></span> in alle vertus, and is an holi man and neigh  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> to God, so
that the purveaunce of God  
<span id="an_251"></span> wolde deme that it were a felonie that he  
<span id="an_252"></span> were touched with any adversites; so that he
wol  
<span id="an_253"></span> nat suffre that swich a man be moeved with
any  
<span id="an_254"></span> bodily maladye. But so as seyde a
philosophre,  
<span id="an_255"></span> the more excellent by me -- he seyde in Grec  
<span id="an_256"></span> that \`vertues han edified the body of the
holi  
<span id="an_257"></span> man.'  
<span id="an_258"></span> "And ofte tyme it betydeth that the somme of  
<span id="an_259"></span> thingis that ben to done is taken to governe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> to good folk,
for that the malice  
<span id="an_261"></span> haboundaunt of schrewes scholde ben  
<span id="an_262"></span> abated. And God yeveth and departeth to
other

<span id="an_267"></span> folk he suffreth to ben travailed with harde  
<span id="an_268"></span> thinges for that thei scholden confermen the  
<span id="an_269"></span> vertues of corage by the usage and the

<span id="an_275"></span> bought honourable renoun of this world by
the  
<span id="an_276"></span> prys of glorious deth; and som men, that ne

<span id="an_278"></span> yeven ensample to other folk that vertu mai
nat  
<span id="an_279"></span> ben overcomyn by adversites. And of alle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> thise thinges
ther nis no doute that thei ne

<span id="an_284"></span> "For certes, that adversite cometh somtyme
to

I  
<span id="an_298"></span> trowe that God dispenseth. For peraventure
the  
<span id="an_299"></span> nature of som man is so overthrowynge to  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> yvel, and so
uncovenable, that the nedy

<span id="an_302"></span> egren hym to don felonyes; and to the
maladye  
<span id="an_303"></span> of hym God putteth remedye to yeven hym  
<span id="an_304"></span> rychesses. And som othir man byholdeth his

wikkidnesse.  
<span id="an_313"></span> To other folke is welefulnesse iyeven
unworthely,  
<span id="an_314"></span> the whiche overthroweth hem into
