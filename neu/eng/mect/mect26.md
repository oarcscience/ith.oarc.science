#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Physician's Tale

<span id="an_1"></span> Ther was, as telleth Titus Livius,  
<span id="an_2"></span> A knyght that called was Virginius,  
<span id="an_3"></span> Fulfild of honour and of worthynesse,  
<span id="an_4"></span> And strong of freendes, and of greet richesse.  
<span id="an_5"></span> This knyght a doghter hadde by his wyf;  
<span id="an_6"></span> No children hadde he mo in al his lyf.  
<span id="an_7"></span> Fair was this mayde in excellent beautee  
<span id="an_8"></span> Aboven every wight that man may see;  
<span id="an_9"></span> For Nature hath with sovereyn diligence  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Yformed hire in
so greet excellence,  
<span id="an_11"></span> As though she wolde seyn, "Lo! I, Nature,  
<span id="an_12"></span> Thus kan I forme and peynte a creature,  
<span id="an_13"></span> Whan that me list; who kan me countrefete?  
<span id="an_14"></span> Pigmalion noght, though he ay forge and bete,  
<span id="an_15"></span> Or grave, or peynte; for I dar wel seyn  
<span id="an_16"></span> Apelles, Zanzis, sholde werche in veyn  
<span id="an_17"></span> Outher to grave, or peynte, or forge, or
bete,  
<span id="an_18"></span> If they presumed me to countrefete.  
<span id="an_19"></span> For He that is the formere principal  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> Hath maked me
his vicaire general,  
<span id="an_21"></span> To forme and peynten erthely creaturis  
<span id="an_22"></span> Right as me list, and ech thyng in my cure is  
<span id="an_23"></span> Under the moone, that may wane and waxe,  
<span id="an_24"></span> And for my werk right no thyng wol I axe;  
<span id="an_25"></span> My lord and I been ful of oon accord.  
<span id="an_26"></span> I made hire to the worshipe of my lord;  
<span id="an_27"></span> So do I alle myne othere creatures,  
<span id="an_28"></span> What colour that they han or what figures."  
<span id="an_29"></span> Thus semeth me that Nature wolde seye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> This mayde of
age twelve yeer was and tweye,  
<span id="an_31"></span> In which that Nature hadde swich delit.  
<span id="an_32"></span> For right as she kan peynte a lilie whit,  
<span id="an_33"></span> And reed a rose, right with swich peynture  
<span id="an_34"></span> She peynted hath this noble creature,  
<span id="an_35"></span> Er she were born, upon hir lymes fre,  
<span id="an_36"></span> Where as by right swiche colours sholde be;  
<span id="an_37"></span> And Phebus dyed hath hire tresses grete  
<span id="an_38"></span> Lyk to the stremes of his burned heete.  
<span id="an_39"></span> And if that excellent was hire beautee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> A thousand
foold moore vertuous was she.  
<span id="an_41"></span> In hire ne lakked no condicioun  
<span id="an_42"></span> That is to preyse, as by discrecioun.  
<span id="an_43"></span> As wel in goost as body chast was she,  
<span id="an_44"></span> For which she floured in virginitee  
<span id="an_45"></span> With alle humylitee and abstinence,  
<span id="an_46"></span> With alle attemperaunce and pacience,  
<span id="an_47"></span> With mesure eek of beryng and array.  
<span id="an_48"></span> Discreet she was in answeryng alway;  
<span id="an_49"></span> Though she were wis as Pallas, dar I seyn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> Hir facound eek
ful wommanly and pleyn,  
<span id="an_51"></span> No countrefeted termes hadde she  
<span id="an_52"></span> To seme wys, but after hir degree  
<span id="an_53"></span> She spak, and alle hire wordes, moore and
lesse,  
<span id="an_54"></span> Sownynge in vertu and in gentillesse.  
<span id="an_55"></span> Shamefast she was in maydens shamefastnesse,  
<span id="an_56"></span> Constant in herte, and evere in bisynesse  
<span id="an_57"></span> To dryve hire out of ydel slogardye.  
<span id="an_58"></span> Bacus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrie;  
<span id="an_59"></span> For wyn and youthe dooth Venus encresse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> As men in fyr
wol casten oille or greesse.  
<span id="an_61"></span> And of hir owene vertu, unconstreyned,  
<span id="an_62"></span> She hath ful ofte tyme syk hire feyned,  
<span id="an_63"></span> For that she wolde fleen the compaignye  
<span id="an_64"></span> Where likly was to treten of folye,  
<span id="an_65"></span> As is at feestes, revels, and at daunces,  
<span id="an_66"></span> That been occasions of daliaunces.  
<span id="an_67"></span> Swich thynges maken children for to be  
<span id="an_68"></span> To soone rype and boold, as men may se,  
<span id="an_69"></span> Which is ful perilous and hath been yoore.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> For al to soone
may she lerne loore  
<span id="an_71"></span> Of booldnesse, whan she woxen is a wyf.  
<span id="an_72"></span> And ye maistresses, in youre olde lyf,  
<span id="an_73"></span> That lordes doghtres han in governaunce,  
<span id="an_74"></span> Ne taketh of my wordes no displesaunce.  
<span id="an_75"></span> Thenketh that ye been set in governynges  
<span id="an_76"></span> Of lordes doghtres oonly for two thynges:  
<span id="an_77"></span> Outher for ye han kept youre honestee,  
<span id="an_78"></span> Or elles ye han falle in freletee,  
<span id="an_79"></span> And knowen wel ynough the olde daunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> And han
forsaken fully swich meschaunce  
<span id="an_81"></span> For everemo; therfore, for Cristes sake,  
<span id="an_82"></span> To teche hem vertu looke that ye ne slake.  
<span id="an_83"></span> A theef of venysoun, that hath forlaft  
<span id="an_84"></span> His likerousnesse and al his olde craft,  
<span id="an_85"></span> Kan kepe a forest best of any man.  
<span id="an_86"></span> Now kepeth wel, for if ye wole, ye kan.  
<span id="an_87"></span> Looke wel that ye unto no vice assente,  
<span id="an_88"></span> Lest ye be dampned for youre wikke entente;  
<span id="an_89"></span> For whoso dooth, a traitour is, certeyn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> And taketh kep
of that that I shal seyn:  
<span id="an_91"></span> Of alle tresons sovereyn pestilence  
<span id="an_92"></span> Is whan a wight bitrayseth innocence.  
<span id="an_93"></span> Ye fadres and ye moodres eek also,  
<span id="an_94"></span> Though ye han children, be it oon or mo,  
<span id="an_95"></span> Youre is the charge of al hir surveiaunce,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Whil that they been under youre governaunce.  
<span id="an_97"></span> Beth war, if by ensample of youre lyvynge,  
<span id="an_98"></span> Or by youre necligence in chastisynge,  
<span id="an_99"></span> That they ne perisse; for I dar wel seye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> If that they
doon, ye shul it deere abeye.  
<span id="an_101"></span> Under a shepherde softe and necligent  
<span id="an_102"></span> The wolf hath many a sheep and lamb torent.  
<span id="an_103"></span> Suffiseth oon ensample now as heere,  
<span id="an_104"></span> For I moot turne agayn to my matere.  
<span id="an_105"></span> This mayde, of which I wol this tale
expresse,  
<span id="an_106"></span> So kepte hirself hir neded no maistresse,  
<span id="an_107"></span> For in hir lyvyng maydens myghten rede,  
<span id="an_108"></span> As in a book, every good word or dede  
<span id="an_109"></span> That longeth to a mayden vertuous,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> She was so
prudent and so bountevous.  
<span id="an_111"></span> For which the fame out sprong on every syde,  
<span id="an_112"></span> Bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee wyde,  
<span id="an_113"></span> That thurgh that land they preised hire
echone  
<span id="an_114"></span> That loved vertu, save Envye allone,  
<span id="an_115"></span> That sory is of oother mennes wele  
<span id="an_116"></span> And glad is of his sorwe and his unheele.  
<span id="an_117"></span> (The Doctour maketh this descripcioun.)  
<span id="an_118"></span> This mayde upon a day wente in the toun  
<span id="an_119"></span> Toward a temple, with hire mooder deere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> As is of
yonge maydens the manere.  
<span id="an_121"></span> Now was ther thanne a justice in that toun,  
<span id="an_122"></span> That governour was of that regioun.  
<span id="an_123"></span> And so bifel this juge his eyen caste  
<span id="an_124"></span> Upon this mayde, avysynge hym ful faste,  
<span id="an_125"></span> As she cam forby ther as this juge stood.  
<span id="an_126"></span> Anon his herte chaunged and his mood,  
<span id="an_127"></span> So was he caught with beautee of this mayde,  
<span id="an_128"></span> And to hymself ful pryvely he sayde,  
<span id="an_129"></span> "This mayde shal be myn, for any man!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Anon the
feend into his herte ran,  
<span id="an_131"></span> And taughte hym sodeynly that he by slyghte  
<span id="an_132"></span> The mayden to his purpos wynne myghte.  
<span id="an_133"></span> For certes, by no force ne by no meede,  
<span id="an_134"></span> Hym thoughte, he was nat able for to speede;  
<span id="an_135"></span> For she was strong of freendes, and eek she  
<span id="an_136"></span> Confermed was in swich soverayn bountee  
<span id="an_137"></span> That wel he wiste he myghte hire nevere
wynne  
<span id="an_138"></span> As for to make hire with hir body synne.  
<span id="an_139"></span> For which, by greet deliberacioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> He sente
after a cherl, was in the toun,  
<span id="an_141"></span> Which that he knew for subtil and for boold.  
<span id="an_142"></span> This juge unto this cherl his tale hath
toold  
<span id="an_143"></span> In secree wise, and made hym to ensure  
<span id="an_144"></span> He sholde telle it to no creature,  
<span id="an_145"></span> And if he dide, he sholde lese his heed.  
<span id="an_146"></span> Whan that assented was this cursed reed,  
<span id="an_147"></span> Glad was this juge, and maked him greet
cheere,  
<span id="an_148"></span> And yaf hym yiftes preciouse and deere.  
<span id="an_149"></span> Whan shapen was al hire conspiracie  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> Fro point to
point, how that his lecherie  
<span id="an_151"></span> Parfourned sholde been ful subtilly,  
<span id="an_152"></span> As ye shul heere it after openly,  
<span id="an_153"></span> Hoom gooth the cherl, that highte Claudius.  
<span id="an_154"></span> This false juge, that highte Apius,  
<span id="an_155"></span> (So was his name, for this is no fable,  
<span id="an_156"></span> But knowen for historial thyng notable;  
<span id="an_157"></span> The sentence of it sooth is, out of doute),  
<span id="an_158"></span> This false juge gooth now faste aboute  
<span id="an_159"></span> To hasten his delit al that he may.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> And so bifel
soone after, on a day,  
<span id="an_161"></span> This false juge, as telleth us the storie,  
<span id="an_162"></span> As he was wont, sat in his consistorie,  
<span id="an_163"></span> And yaf his doomes upon sondry cas.  
<span id="an_164"></span> This false cherl cam forth a ful greet pas,  
<span id="an_165"></span> And seyde, "Lord, if that it be youre wille,  
<span id="an_166"></span> As dooth me right upon this pitous bille,  
<span id="an_167"></span> In which I pleyne upon Virginius;  
<span id="an_168"></span> And if that he wol seyn it is nat thus,  
<span id="an_169"></span> I wol it preeve, and fynde good witnesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> That sooth is
that my bille wol expresse."  
<span id="an_171"></span> The juge answerde, "Of this, in his absence,  
<span id="an_172"></span> I may nat yeve diffynytyf sentence.  
<span id="an_173"></span> Lat do hym calle, and I wol gladly heere;  
<span id="an_174"></span> Thou shalt have al right, and no wrong
heere."  
<span id="an_175"></span> Virginius cam to wite the juges wille,  
<span id="an_176"></span> And right anon was rad this cursed bille;  
<span id="an_177"></span> The sentence of it was as ye shul heere:  
<span id="an_178"></span> "To yow, my lord, sire Apius so deere,  
<span id="an_179"></span> Sheweth youre povre servant Claudius  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> How that a
knyght, called Virginius,  
<span id="an_181"></span> Agayns the lawe, agayn al equitee,  
<span id="an_182"></span> Holdeth, expres agayn the wyl of me,  
<span id="an_183"></span> My servant, which that is my thral by right,  
<span id="an_184"></span> Which fro myn hous was stole upon a nyght,  
<span id="an_185"></span> Whil that she was ful yong; this wol I
preeve  
<span id="an_186"></span> By witnesse, lord, so that it nat yow
greeve.  
<span id="an_187"></span> She nys his doghter nat, what so he seye.  
<span id="an_188"></span> Wherfore to yow, my lord the juge, I preye,  
<span id="an_189"></span> Yeld me my thral, if that it be youre
wille."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> Lo, this was
al the sentence of his bille.  
<span id="an_191"></span> Virginius gan upon the cherl biholde,  
<span id="an_192"></span> But hastily, er he his tale tolde,  
<span id="an_193"></span> And wolde have preeved it as sholde a
knyght,  
<span id="an_194"></span> And eek by witnessyng of many a wight,  
<span id="an_195"></span> That al was fals that seyde his adversarie,  
<span id="an_196"></span> This cursed juge wolde no thyng tarie,  
<span id="an_197"></span> Ne heere a word moore of Virginius,  
<span id="an_198"></span> But yaf his juggement, and seyde thus:  
<span id="an_199"></span> "I deeme anon this cherl his servant have;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Thou shalt no
lenger in thyn hous hir save.  
<span id="an_201"></span> Go bryng hire forth, and put hire in oure
warde.  
<span id="an_202"></span> The cherl shal have his thral, this I
awarde."  
<span id="an_203"></span> And whan this worthy knyght Virginius  
<span id="an_204"></span> Thurgh sentence of this justice Apius  
<span id="an_205"></span> Moste by force his deere doghter yiven  
<span id="an_206"></span> Unto the juge, in lecherie to lyven,  
<span id="an_207"></span> He gooth hym hoom, and sette him in his
halle,  
<span id="an_208"></span> And leet anon his deere doghter calle,  
<span id="an_209"></span> And with a face deed as asshen colde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> Upon hir
humble face he gan biholde,  
<span id="an_211"></span> With fadres pitee stikynge thurgh his herte,  
<span id="an_212"></span> Al wolde he from his purpos nat converte.  
<span id="an_213"></span> "Doghter," quod he, "Virginia, by thy name,

<span id="an_216"></span> For nevere thou deservedest wherfore  
<span id="an_217"></span> To dyen with a swerd or with a knyf.  
<span id="an_218"></span> O deere doghter, endere of my lyf,  
<span id="an_219"></span> Which I have fostred up with swich plesaunce  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> That thou

<span id="an_225"></span> For love, and nat for hate, thou most be

<span id="an_227"></span> Allas, that evere Apius the say!  
<span id="an_228"></span> Thus hath he falsly jugged the to-day" --  
<span id="an_229"></span> And tolde hire al the cas, as ye bifore  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> Han herd; nat
nedeth for to telle it moore.  
<span id="an_231"></span> "O mercy, deere fader!" quod this mayde,  
<span id="an_232"></span> And with that word she bothe hir armes layde  
<span id="an_233"></span> Aboute his nekke, as she was wont to do.  
<span id="an_234"></span> The teeris bruste out of hir eyen two,  
<span id="an_235"></span> And seyde, "Goode fader, shal I dye?  
<span id="an_236"></span> Is ther no grace, is ther no remedye?"  
<span id="an_237"></span> "No, certes, deere doghter myn," quod he.  
<span id="an_238"></span> "Thanne yif me leyser, fader myn," quod she,  
<span id="an_239"></span> "My deeth for to compleyne a litel space;

<span id="an_242"></span> And, God it woot, no thyng was hir trespas,  
<span id="an_243"></span> But for she ran hir fader first to see,  
<span id="an_244"></span> To welcome hym with greet solempnitee."  
<span id="an_245"></span> And with that word she fil aswowne anon,  
<span id="an_246"></span> And after, whan hir swownyng is agon,  
<span id="an_247"></span> She riseth up, and to hir fader sayde,  
<span id="an_248"></span> "Blissed be God that I shal dye a mayde!  
<span id="an_249"></span> Yif me my deeth, er that I have a shame;

<span id="an_251"></span> And with that word she preyed hym ful ofte  
<span id="an_252"></span> That with his swerd he wolde smyte softe;  
<span id="an_253"></span> And with that word aswowne doun she fil.

<span id="an_256"></span> And to the juge he gan it to presente,  
<span id="an_257"></span> As he sat yet in doom in consistorie.  
<span id="an_258"></span> And whan the juge it saugh, as seith the
storie,  
<span id="an_259"></span> He bad to take hym and anhange hym faste;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> But right
anon a thousand peple in thraste,  
<span id="an_261"></span> To save the knyght, for routhe and for
pitee,  
<span id="an_262"></span> For knowen was the false iniquitee.  
<span id="an_263"></span> The peple anon had suspect in this thyng,  
<span id="an_264"></span> By manere of the cherles chalangyng,  
<span id="an_265"></span> That it was by the assent of Apius;  
<span id="an_266"></span> They wisten wel that he was lecherus.  
<span id="an_267"></span> For which unto this Apius they gon  
<span id="an_268"></span> And caste hym in a prisoun right anon,
