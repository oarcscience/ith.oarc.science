#### The Shorter Poems

### The Former Age

<span id="an_1"></span> A blisful lyf, a paisible and a swete,  
<span id="an_2"></span> Ledden the peples in the former age.  
<span id="an_3"></span> They helde hem payed of the fruites that they
ete,  
<span id="an_4"></span> Which that the feldes yave hem by usage;  
<span id="an_5"></span> They ne were nat forpampred with outrage.  
<span id="an_6"></span> Unknowen was the quern and ek the melle;  
<span id="an_7"></span> They eten mast, hawes, and swich pounage,  
<span id="an_8"></span> And dronken water of the colde welle.  
<span id="an_9"></span> Yit nas the ground nat wounded with the
plough,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> But corn
up-sprong, unsowe of mannes hond,  
<span id="an_11"></span> The which they gnodded and eete nat half
ynough.  
<span id="an_12"></span> No man yit knew the forwes of his lond,  
<span id="an_13"></span> No man the fyr out of the flint yit fond,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Unkorven and ungrobbed lay the vyne;  
<span id="an_15"></span> No man yit in the morter spyces grond  
<span id="an_16"></span> To clarre ne to sause of galantyne.  
<span id="an_17"></span> No mader, welde, or wood no litestere  
<span id="an_18"></span> Ne knew; the flees was of his former hewe;  
<span id="an_19"></span> No flesh ne wiste offence of egge or spere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> No coyn ne knew
man which was fals or trewe,  
<span id="an_21"></span> No ship yit karf the wawes grene and blewe,  
<span id="an_22"></span> No marchaunt yit ne fette outlandish ware.  
<span id="an_23"></span> No trompes for the werres folk ne knewe,  
<span id="an_24"></span> Ne toures heye and walles rounde or square.  
<span id="an_25"></span> What sholde it han avayled to werreye?  
<span id="an_26"></span> Ther lay no profit, ther was no richesse;  
<span id="an_27"></span> But cursed was the tyme, I dare wel seye,  
<span id="an_28"></span> That men first dide hir swety bysinesse  
<span id="an_29"></span> To grobbe up metal, lurkinge in derknesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> And in the
riveres first gemmes soghte.  
<span id="an_31"></span> Allas, than sprong up al the cursednesse  
<span id="an_32"></span> Of coveytyse, that first our sorwe broghte.  
<span id="an_33"></span> Thise tyraunts putte hem gladly nat in pres  
<span id="an_34"></span> No wildnesse ne no busshes for to winne,  
<span id="an_35"></span> Ther poverte is, as seith Diogenes,  
<span id="an_36"></span> Ther as vitaile is ek so skars and thinne  
<span id="an_37"></span> That noght but mast or apples is therinne;  
<span id="an_38"></span> But, ther as bagges ben and fat vitaile,  
<span id="an_39"></span> Ther wol they gon, and spare for no sinne  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> With al hir ost
the cite for to asayle.  
<span id="an_41"></span> Yit was no paleis-chaumbres ne non halles;  
<span id="an_42"></span> In caves and wodes softe and swete  
<span id="an_43"></span> Slepten this blissed folk withoute walles  
<span id="an_44"></span> On gras or leves in parfit quiete.  
<span id="an_45"></span> Ne doun of fetheres ne no bleched shete  
<span id="an_46"></span> Was kid to hem, but in seurtee they slepte.  
<span id="an_47"></span> Hir hertes were al oon withoute galles;  
<span id="an_48"></span> Everich of hem his feith to other kepte.  
<span id="an_49"></span> Unforged was the hauberk and the plate;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> The lambish
peple, voyd of alle vyce,  
<span id="an_51"></span> Hadden no fantasye to debate,  
<span id="an_52"></span> But ech of hem wolde other wel cheryce.  
<span id="an_53"></span> No pryde, non envye, non avaryce,  
<span id="an_54"></span> No lord, no taylage by no tyrannye;  
<span id="an_55"></span> Humblesse and pees, good feith the emperice.  
<span id="an_56"></span> Yit was not Jupiter the likerous,  
<span id="an_57"></span> That first was fader of delicacye,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Come in this world; ne Nembrot, desirous  
<span id="an_59"></span> To regne, had nat maad his toures hye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Allas, allas,
now may men wepe and crye!  
<span id="an_61"></span> For in oure dayes nis but covetyse,  
<span id="an_62"></span> Doublenesse, and tresoun, and envye,  
<span id="an_63"></span> Poyson, manslawhtre, and mordre in sondry
wyse.
