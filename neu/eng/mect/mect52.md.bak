### The Parliament of Fowls

<span id="an_1"></span> The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne,  
<span id="an_2"></span> Th' assay so hard, so sharp the conquerynge,  
<span id="an_3"></span> The dredful joye alwey that slit so yerne:  
<span id="an_4"></span> Al this mene I by Love, that my felynge  
<span id="an_5"></span> Astonyeth with his wonderful werkynge  
<span id="an_6"></span> So sore, iwis, that whan I on hym thynke  
<span id="an_7"></span> Nat wot I wel wher that I flete or synke.  
<span id="an_8"></span> For al be that I knowe nat Love in dede,  
<span id="an_9"></span> Ne wot how that he quiteth folk here hyre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Yit happeth me
ful ofte in bokes reede  
<span id="an_11"></span> Of his myrakles and his crewel yre.  
<span id="an_12"></span> There rede I wel he wol be lord and syre;  
<span id="an_13"></span> I dar nat seyn, his strokes been so sore,  
<span id="an_14"></span> But "God save swich a lord!" -- I can na
moore.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Of usage -- what for lust and what for lore
--  
<span id="an_16"></span> On bokes rede I ofte, as I yow tolde.  
<span id="an_17"></span> But wherfore that I speke al this? Nat yoore  
<span id="an_18"></span> Agon it happede me for to beholde  
<span id="an_19"></span> Upon a bok, was write with lettres olde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> And therupon, a
certeyn thing to lerne,  
<span id="an_21"></span> The longe day ful faste I redde and yerne.  
<span id="an_22"></span> For out of olde feldes, as men seyth,  
<span id="an_23"></span> Cometh al this newe corn from yer to yere,  
<span id="an_24"></span> And out of olde bokes, in good feyth,  
<span id="an_25"></span> Cometh al this newe science that men lere.  
<span id="an_26"></span> But now to purpos as of this matere:  
<span id="an_27"></span> To rede forth hit gan me so delite  
<span id="an_28"></span> That al that day me thoughte but a lyte.  
<span id="an_29"></span> This bok of which I make mencioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Entitled was al
ther, as I shal telle:  
<span id="an_31"></span> "Tullyus of the Drem of Scipioun."  
<span id="an_32"></span> Chapitres sevene it hadde, of hevene and
helle  
<span id="an_33"></span> And erthe, and soules that therinne dwelle,  
<span id="an_34"></span> Of whiche, as shortly as I can it trete,  
<span id="an_35"></span> Of his sentence I wol yow seyn the greete.  
<span id="an_36"></span> Fyrst telleth it, whan Scipion was come  
<span id="an_37"></span> In Affrike, how he meteth Massynisse,  
<span id="an_38"></span> That hym for joie in armes hath inome;  
<span id="an_39"></span> Thanne telleth \[it\] here speche and al the
blysse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> That was betwix
hem til the day gan mysse,  
<span id="an_41"></span> And how his auncestre, Affrycan so deere,  
<span id="an_42"></span> Gan in his slep that nyght to hym apere.  
<span id="an_43"></span> Thanne telleth it that, from a sterry place,  
<span id="an_44"></span> How Affrycan hath hym Cartage shewed,  
<span id="an_45"></span> And warnede hym beforn of al his grace,  
<span id="an_46"></span> And seyde hym what man, lered other lewed,  
<span id="an_47"></span> That lovede commune profyt, wel ithewed,  
<span id="an_48"></span> He shulde into a blysful place wende  
<span id="an_49"></span> There as joye is that last withouten ende.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> Thanne axede he
if folk that here been dede  
<span id="an_51"></span> Han lyf and dwellynge in another place.  
<span id="an_52"></span> And Affrican seyde, "Ye, withouten drede,"  
<span id="an_53"></span> And that oure present worldes lyves space  
<span id="an_54"></span> Nis but a maner deth, what wey we trace;  
<span id="an_55"></span> And rightful folk shul gon, after they dye,  
<span id="an_56"></span> To hevene; and shewede hym the Galaxye.  
<span id="an_57"></span> Thanne shewede he hym the lytel erthe that here
is,  
<span id="an_58"></span> At regard of the hevenes quantite;  
<span id="an_59"></span> And after shewede he hym the nyne speres;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> And after that
the melodye herde he  
<span id="an_61"></span> That cometh of thilke speres thryes thre,  
<span id="an_62"></span> That welle is of musik and melodye  
<span id="an_63"></span> In this world here, and cause of armonye.  
<span id="an_64"></span> Than bad he hym, syn erthe was so lyte,  
<span id="an_65"></span> And dissevable and ful of harde grace,  
<span id="an_66"></span> That he ne shulde hym in the world delyte.  
<span id="an_67"></span> Thanne tolde he hym, in certeyn yeres space  
<span id="an_68"></span> That every sterre shulde come into his place  
<span id="an_69"></span> Ther it was first, and al shulde out of mynde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> That in this
world is don of al mankynde.  
<span id="an_71"></span> Thanne preyede hym Scipion to telle hym al  
<span id="an_72"></span> The wey to come into that hevene blisse.  
<span id="an_73"></span> And he seyde, "Know thyself first immortal,  
<span id="an_74"></span> And loke ay besyly thow werche and wysse  
<span id="an_75"></span> To commune profit, and thow shalt not mysse  
<span id="an_76"></span> To comen swiftly to that place deere  
<span id="an_77"></span> That ful of blysse is and of soules cleere.  
<span id="an_78"></span> "But brekers of the lawe, soth to seyne,  
<span id="an_79"></span> And likerous folk, after that they ben dede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> Shul whirle
aboute th' erthe alwey in peyne,  
<span id="an_81"></span> Tyl many a world be passed, out of drede,  
<span id="an_82"></span> And than, foryeven al hir wikked dede,  
<span id="an_83"></span> Than shul they come into that blysful place,  
<span id="an_84"></span> To which to comen God the sende his grace."  
<span id="an_85"></span> The day gan faylen, and the derke nyght,  
<span id="an_86"></span> That reveth bestes from here besynesse,  
<span id="an_87"></span> Berafte me my bok for lak of lyght,  
<span id="an_88"></span> And to my bed I gan me for to dresse,  
<span id="an_89"></span> Fulfyld of thought and busy hevynesse;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> For bothe I
hadde thyng which that I nolde,  
<span id="an_91"></span> And ek I ne hadde that thyng that I wolde.  
<span id="an_92"></span> But fynally my spirit at the laste,  
<span id="an_93"></span> For wery of my labour al the day,  
<span id="an_94"></span> Tok reste, that made me to slepe faste;  
<span id="an_95"></span> And in my slep I mette, as that I lay,  
<span id="an_96"></span> How Affrican, ryght in the selve aray  
<span id="an_97"></span> That Scipion hym say byfore that tyde,  
<span id="an_98"></span> Was come and stod right at my beddes syde.  
<span id="an_99"></span> The wery huntere, slepynge in his bed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> To wode ayeyn
his mynde goth anon;  
<span id="an_101"></span> The juge dremeth how his plees been sped;  
<span id="an_102"></span> The cartere dremeth how his cart is gon;  
<span id="an_103"></span> The riche, of gold; the knyght fyght with his
fon;  
<span id="an_104"></span> The syke met he drynketh of the tonne;  
<span id="an_105"></span> The lovere met he hath his lady wonne.  
<span id="an_106"></span> Can I not seyn if that the cause were  
<span id="an_107"></span> For I hadde red of Affrican byforn  
<span id="an_108"></span> That made me to mete that he stod there;  
<span id="an_109"></span> But thus seyde he: "Thow hast the so wel
born  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> In lokynge of
myn olde bok totorn,  
<span id="an_111"></span> Of which Macrobye roughte nat a lyte,  
<span id="an_112"></span> That sumdel of thy labour wolde I quyte."  
<span id="an_113"></span> Cytherea, thow blysful lady swete,  
<span id="an_114"></span> That with thy fyrbrond dauntest whom the
lest  
<span id="an_115"></span> And madest me this sweven for to mete,  
<span id="an_116"></span> Be thow myn helpe in this, for thow mayst
best!  
<span id="an_117"></span> As wisly as I sey the north-north-west,  
<span id="an_118"></span> Whan I began my sweven for to write,  
<span id="an_119"></span> So yif me myght to ryme, and endyte!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> This forseyde
Affrican me hente anon  
<span id="an_121"></span> And forth with hym unto a gate broughte,  
<span id="an_122"></span> Ryght of a park walled with grene ston;  
<span id="an_123"></span> And over the gate, with lettres large
iwroughte,  
<span id="an_124"></span> There were vers iwriten, as me thoughte,  
<span id="an_125"></span> On eyther half, of ful gret difference,  
<span id="an_126"></span> Of which I shal yow seyn the pleyn sentence:  
<span id="an_127"></span> "Thorgh me men gon into that blysful place  
<span id="an_128"></span> Of hertes hele and dedly woundes cure;  
<span id="an_129"></span> Thorgh me men gon unto the welle of grace,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> There grene
and lusty May shal evere endure.  
<span id="an_131"></span> This is the wey to al good aventure.  
<span id="an_132"></span> Be glad, thow redere, and thy sorwe
of-caste;  
<span id="an_133"></span> Al open am I -- passe in, and sped thee
faste!"  
<span id="an_134"></span> "Thorgh me men gon," than spak that other
side,  
<span id="an_135"></span> "Unto the mortal strokes of the spere  
<span id="an_136"></span> Of which Disdayn and Daunger is the gyde,  
<span id="an_137"></span> Ther nevere tre shal fruyt ne leves bere.  
<span id="an_138"></span> This strem yow ledeth to the sorweful were  
<span id="an_139"></span> There as the fish in prysoun is al drye;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Th' eschewing
is only the remedye!"  
<span id="an_141"></span> These vers of gold and blak iwriten were,  
<span id="an_142"></span> Of whiche I gan astoned to beholde.  
<span id="an_143"></span> For with that oon encresede ay my fere  
<span id="an_144"></span> And with that other gan myn herte bolde;  
<span id="an_145"></span> That oon me hette, that other dide me colde;  
<span id="an_146"></span> No wit hadde I, for errour, for to chese  
<span id="an_147"></span> To entre or flen, or me to save or lese.  
<span id="an_148"></span> Right as betwixen adamauntes two  
<span id="an_149"></span> Of evene myght, a pece of yren set  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> Ne hath no

<span id="an_151"></span> For what that oon may hale, that other let
--  
<span id="an_152"></span> Ferde I, that nyste whether me was bet  
<span id="an_153"></span> To entre or leve, til Affrycan, my gide,  
<span id="an_154"></span> Me hente and shof in at the gates wide,  
<span id="an_155"></span> And seyde, "It stondeth writen in thy face,  
<span id="an_156"></span> Thyn errour, though thow telle it not to me;  
<span id="an_157"></span> But dred the not to come into this place,

<span id="an_161"></span> As sek man hath of swete and bytternesse.  
<span id="an_162"></span> "But natheles, although that thow be dul,  
<span id="an_163"></span> Yit that thow canst not do, yit mayst thow

<span id="an_164"></span> For many a man that may nat stonde a pul  
<span id="an_165"></span> Yet liketh hym at wrastlyng for to be,  
<span id="an_166"></span> And demen yit wher he do bet or he.  
<span id="an_167"></span> And if thow haddest connyng for t' endite,  
<span id="an_168"></span> I shal the shewe mater of to wryte."  
<span id="an_169"></span> With that myn hand in his he tok anon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> Of which I
confort caughte, and wente in faste.  
<span id="an_171"></span> But, Lord, so I was glad and wel begoon!  
<span id="an_172"></span> For overal where that I myne eyen caste  
<span id="an_173"></span> Were trees clad with leves that ay shal
laste,  
<span id="an_174"></span> Ech in his kynde, of colour fresh and greene  
<span id="an_175"></span> As emeraude, that joye was to seene.  
<span id="an_176"></span> The byldere ok, and ek the hardy asshe;  
<span id="an_177"></span> The piler elm, the cofre unto carayne;  
<span id="an_178"></span> The boxtre pipere, holm to whippes lashe;  
<span id="an_179"></span> The saylynge fyr; the cipresse, deth to
playne;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> The shetere
ew; the asp for shaftes pleyne;  
<span id="an_181"></span> The olyve of pes, and eke the dronke vyne;  
<span id="an_182"></span> The victor palm, the laurer to devyne.  
<span id="an_183"></span> A gardyn saw I ful of blosmy bowes  
<span id="an_184"></span> Upon a ryver, in a grene mede,  
<span id="an_185"></span> There as swetnesse everemore inow is,  
<span id="an_186"></span> With floures white, blewe, yelwe, and rede,  
<span id="an_187"></span> And colde welle-stremes, nothyng dede,  
<span id="an_188"></span> That swymmen ful of smale fishes lighte,  
<span id="an_189"></span> With fynnes rede and skales sylver bryghte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> On every bow
the bryddes herde I synge,  
<span id="an_191"></span> With voys of aungel in here armonye;  
<span id="an_192"></span> Some besyede hem here bryddes forth to
brynge;  
<span id="an_193"></span> The litel conyes to here pley gonne hye;  
<span id="an_194"></span> And ferther al aboute I gan aspye  
<span id="an_195"></span> The dredful ro, the buk, the hert and hynde,  
<span id="an_196"></span> Squyrels, and bestes smale of gentil kynde.  
<span id="an_197"></span> Of instruments of strenges in acord  
<span id="an_198"></span> Herde I so pleye a ravyshyng swetnesse,  
<span id="an_199"></span> That God, that makere is of al and lord,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Ne herde
nevere beter, as I gesse.  
<span id="an_201"></span> Therwith a wynd, unnethe it myghte be lesse,  
<span id="an_202"></span> Made in the leves grene a noyse softe  
<span id="an_203"></span> Acordaunt to the foules song alofte.  
<span id="an_204"></span> Th' air of that place so attempre was  
<span id="an_205"></span> That nevere was grevaunce of hot ne cold.  
<span id="an_206"></span> There wex ek every holsom spice and gras;  
<span id="an_207"></span> No man may there waxe sek ne old;  
<span id="an_208"></span> Yit was there joye more a thousandfold  
<span id="an_209"></span> Than man can telle; ne nevere wolde it
nyghte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> But ay cler
day to any mannes syghte.  
<span id="an_211"></span> Under a tre, besyde a welle, I say  
<span id="an_212"></span> Cupide, oure lord, his arwes forge and file;  
<span id="an_213"></span> And at his fet his bowe al redy lay;  
<span id="an_214"></span> And Wille, his doughter, temprede al this
while  
<span id="an_215"></span> The hevedes in the welle, and with hire wile  
<span id="an_216"></span> She couchede hem, after they shulde serve  
<span id="an_217"></span> Some for to sle, and some to wounde and
kerve.  
<span id="an_218"></span> Tho was I war of Plesaunce anon-ryght,  
<span id="an_219"></span> And of Aray, and Lust, and Curteysie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> And of the
Craft that can and hath the myght  
<span id="an_221"></span> To don by force a wyght to don folye --  
<span id="an_222"></span> Disfigurat was she, I nyl nat lye;  
<span id="an_223"></span> And by hymself, under an ok, I gesse,  
<span id="an_224"></span> Saw I Delyt, that stod with Gentilesse.  
<span id="an_225"></span> I saw Beute withouten any atyr,  
<span id="an_226"></span> And Youthe, ful of game and jolyte;  
<span id="an_227"></span> Foolhardynesse, Flaterye, and Desyr,  
<span id="an_228"></span> Messagerye, and Meede, and other thre --  
<span id="an_229"></span> Here names shul not here be told for me --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> And upon
pilers greete of jasper longe  
<span id="an_231"></span> I saw a temple of bras ifounded stronge.  
<span id="an_232"></span> Aboute the temple daunsedyn alwey  
<span id="an_233"></span> Women inowe, of whiche some ther weere  
<span id="an_234"></span> Fayre of hemself, and some of hem were gay;  
<span id="an_235"></span> In kertels, al dishevele, wente they there:  
<span id="an_236"></span> That was here offyce alwey, yer by yeere.  
<span id="an_237"></span> And on the temple, of dowves white and fayre  
<span id="an_238"></span> Saw I syttynge many an hundred peyre.  
<span id="an_239"></span> Byfore the temple-dore ful soberly  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> Dame Pees
sat, with a curtyn in hire hond,  
<span id="an_241"></span> And by hire syde, wonder discretly,  
<span id="an_242"></span> Dame Pacience syttynge there I fond,  
<span id="an_243"></span> With face pale, upon an hil of sond;  
<span id="an_244"></span> And aldernext, withinne and ek withoute,  
<span id="an_245"></span> Byheste and Art, and of here folk a route.  
<span id="an_246"></span> Withinne the temple, of sykes hoote as fyr  
<span id="an_247"></span> I herde a swogh that gan aboute renne,  
<span id="an_248"></span> Whiche sikes were engendered with desyr,  
<span id="an_249"></span> That maden every auter for to brenne  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> Of newe

<span id="an_251"></span> That al the cause of sorwes that they drye  
<span id="an_252"></span> Cam of the bittere goddesse Jelosye.  
<span id="an_253"></span> The god Priapus saw I, as I wente,  
<span id="an_254"></span> Withinne the temple in sovereyn place
stonde,  
<span id="an_255"></span> In swich aray as whan the asse hym shente  
<span id="an_256"></span> With cri by nighte, and with hys sceptre in

<span id="an_257"></span> Ful besyly men gonne assaye and fonde  
<span id="an_258"></span> Upon his hed to sette, of sondry hewe,  
<span id="an_259"></span> Garlondes ful of freshe floures newe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> And in a

<span id="an_261"></span> Fond I Venus and hire porter Richesse,  
<span id="an_262"></span> That was ful noble and hautayn of hyre port

<span id="an_263"></span> Derk was that place, but afterward

<span id="an_274"></span> The place yaf a thousand savours sote,

<span id="an_533"></span> The terslet seyde thanne in this manere:  
<span id="an_534"></span> "Ful hard were it to preve by resoun

<span id="an_638"></span> With dredful vois the formel hire answerde,
