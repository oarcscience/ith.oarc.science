#### The Legend of Good Women

### Prologue G

<span id="an_1"></span> A thousand sythes have I herd men telle  
<span id="an_2"></span> That there is joye in hevene and peyne in
helle,  
<span id="an_3"></span> And I acorde wel that it be so;  
<span id="an_4"></span> But natheles, this wot I wel also,  
<span id="an_5"></span> That there ne is non that dwelleth in this
contre  
<span id="an_6"></span> That eyther hath in helle or hevene ybe,  
<span id="an_7"></span> Ne may of it non other weyes witen  
<span id="an_8"></span> But as he hath herd seyd or founde it writen;  
<span id="an_9"></span> For by assay there may no man it preve.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> But Goddes
forbode but men shulde leve  
<span id="an_11"></span> Wel more thyng than men han seyn with ye!  
<span id="an_12"></span> Men shal nat wenen every thyng a lye  
<span id="an_13"></span> For that he say it nat of yore ago.  
<span id="an_14"></span> God wot a thyng is nevere the lesse so  
<span id="an_15"></span> Thow every wyght ne may it nat yse.  
<span id="an_16"></span> Bernard the monk ne say nat al, parde!  
<span id="an_17"></span> Thanne mote we to bokes that we fynde,  
<span id="an_18"></span> Thourgh whiche that olde thynges ben in
mynde,  
<span id="an_19"></span> And to the doctryne of these olde wyse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> Yeven credence,
in every skylful wyse,  
<span id="an_21"></span> And trowen on these olde aproved storyes  
<span id="an_22"></span> Of holynesse, of regnes, of victoryes,  
<span id="an_23"></span> Of love, of hate, of othere sondry thynges,  
<span id="an_24"></span> Of which I may nat make rehersynges.  
<span id="an_25"></span> And if that olde bokes weren aweye,  
<span id="an_26"></span> Yloren were of remembrance the keye.  
<span id="an_27"></span> Wel oughte us thanne on olde bokes leve,  
<span id="an_28"></span> There as there is non other assay by preve.  
<span id="an_29"></span> And as for me, though that my wit be lite,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> On bokes for to
rede I me delyte,  
<span id="an_31"></span> And in myn herte have hem in reverence,  
<span id="an_32"></span> And to hem yeve swich lust and swich credence  
<span id="an_33"></span> That there is wel unethe game non  
<span id="an_34"></span> That fro my bokes make me to gon,  
<span id="an_35"></span> But it be other upon the halyday,  
<span id="an_36"></span> Or ellis in the joly tyme of May,  
<span id="an_37"></span> Whan that I here the smale foules synge,  
<span id="an_38"></span> And that the floures gynne for to sprynge.  
<span id="an_39"></span> Farwel my stodye, as lastynge that sesoun!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> Now have I
therto this condicioun,  
<span id="an_41"></span> That, of alle the floures in the mede,  
<span id="an_42"></span> Thanne love I most these floures white and
rede,  
<span id="an_43"></span> Swyche as men calle dayesyes in oure toun.  
<span id="an_44"></span> To hem have I so gret affeccioun,  
<span id="an_45"></span> As I seyde erst, whan comen is the May,  
<span id="an_46"></span> That in my bed there daweth me no day  
<span id="an_47"></span> That I n' am up and walkynge in the mede  
<span id="an_48"></span> To sen these floures agen the sonne sprede  
<span id="an_49"></span> Whan it up ryseth by the morwe shene,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> The longe day
thus walkynge in the grene.  
<span id="an_51"></span> And whan the sonne gynneth for to weste,  
<span id="an_52"></span> Thanne closeth it, and draweth it to reste,  
<span id="an_53"></span> So sore it is afered of the nyght,  
<span id="an_54"></span> Til on the morwe that it is dayes lyght.  
<span id="an_55"></span> This dayesye, of alle floures flour,  
<span id="an_56"></span> Fulfyld of vertu and of alle honour,  
<span id="an_57"></span> And evere ylike fayr and fresh of hewe,  
<span id="an_58"></span> As wel in wynter as in somer newe,  
<span id="an_59"></span> Fayn wolde I preysen, if I coude aryght;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> But wo is me,
it lyth nat in my myght.  
<span id="an_61"></span> For wel I wot that folk han here-beforn  
<span id="an_62"></span> Of makyng ropen, and lad awey the corn;  
<span id="an_63"></span> \[And\] I come after, glenynge here and
there,  
<span id="an_64"></span> And am ful glad if I may fynde an ere  
<span id="an_65"></span> Of any goodly word that they han left.  
<span id="an_66"></span> And if it happe me rehersen eft  
<span id="an_67"></span> That they han in here freshe songes said,  
<span id="an_68"></span> I hope that they wole nat ben evele apayd,  
<span id="an_69"></span> Sith it is seyd in fortheryng and honour  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Of hem that
eyther serven lef or flour.  
<span id="an_71"></span> For trusteth wel, I ne have nat undertake  
<span id="an_72"></span> As of the lef agayn the flour to make,  
<span id="an_73"></span> Ne of the flour to make ageyn the lef,  
<span id="an_74"></span> No more than of the corn agen the shef;  
<span id="an_75"></span> For, as to me, is lefer non, ne lother.  
<span id="an_76"></span> I am witholde yit with never nother;  
<span id="an_77"></span> I not who serveth lef ne who the flour.  
<span id="an_78"></span> That nys nothyng the entent of my labour.  
<span id="an_79"></span> For this werk is al of another tonne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> Of olde story,
er swich strif was begonne.  
<span id="an_81"></span> But wherfore that I spak, to yeve credence  
<span id="an_82"></span> To bokes olde and don hem reverence,  
<span id="an_83"></span> Is for men shulde autoritees beleve,  
<span id="an_84"></span> There as there lyth non other assay by preve.  
<span id="an_85"></span> For myn entent is, or I fro yow fare,  
<span id="an_86"></span> The naked text in English to declare  
<span id="an_87"></span> Of many a story, or elles of many a geste,  
<span id="an_88"></span> As autours seyn; leveth hem if yow leste.  
<span id="an_89"></span> Whan passed was almost the month of May,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> And I hadde
romed, al the someres day,  
<span id="an_91"></span> The grene medewe, of which that I yow tolde,  
<span id="an_92"></span> Upon the freshe dayseie to beholde,  
<span id="an_93"></span> And that the sonne out of the south gan
weste,  
<span id="an_94"></span> And closed was the flour and gon to reste,  
<span id="an_95"></span> For derknesse of the nyght, of which she
dredde,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Hom to myn hous ful swiftly I me spedde,  
<span id="an_97"></span> And in a lytel herber that I have,  
<span id="an_98"></span> Ybenched newe with turves fresshe ygrave,  
<span id="an_99"></span> I bad men shulde me my couche make;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> For deynte of
the newe someres sake,  
<span id="an_101"></span> I bad hem strowe floures on my bed.  
<span id="an_102"></span> Whan I was layd, and hadde myn eyen hed,  
<span id="an_103"></span> I fel aslepe withinne an hour or two.  
<span id="an_104"></span> Me mette how I was in the medewe tho,  
<span id="an_105"></span> And that I romede in that same gyse,  
<span id="an_106"></span> To sen that flour, as ye han herd devyse.  
<span id="an_107"></span> Fayr was this medewe, as thoughte me,
overal;  
<span id="an_108"></span> With floures sote enbrouded was it al.  
<span id="an_109"></span> As for to speke of gomme, or herbe, or tre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Comparisoun
may non ymaked be;  
<span id="an_111"></span> For it surmountede pleynly alle odoures,  
<span id="an_112"></span> And of ryche beaute alle floures.  
<span id="an_113"></span> Forgeten hadde the erthe his pore estat  
<span id="an_114"></span> Of wynter, that hym naked made and mat,  
<span id="an_115"></span> And with his swerd of cold so sore hadde
greved.  
<span id="an_116"></span> Now hadde th' atempre sonne al that releved,  
<span id="an_117"></span> And clothed hym in grene al newe ageyn.  
<span id="an_118"></span> The smale foules, of the seson fayn,  
<span id="an_119"></span> That from the panter and the net ben skaped,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> Upon the
foulere, that hem made awhaped  
<span id="an_121"></span> In wynter, and distroyed hadde hire brod,  
<span id="an_122"></span> In his dispit hem thoughte it dide hem good  
<span id="an_123"></span> To synge of hym, and in here song despise  
<span id="an_124"></span> The foule cherl that for his coveytyse  
<span id="an_125"></span> Hadde hem betrayed with his sophistrye.  
<span id="an_126"></span> This was here song, "The foulere we defye,  
<span id="an_127"></span> \[And\] \[al\] \[his\] \[craft\]." \[And\]
\[some\] \[songen\] \[clere\]  
<span id="an_128"></span> \[Layes\] of love that joye it was to here,  
<span id="an_129"></span> In worshipe and in preysyng of hire make;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> And \[for\]
the newe blysful somers sake,  
<span id="an_131"></span> \[They\] sungen, "Blyssed be Seynt Valentyn!  
<span id="an_132"></span> \[For\] \[on\] his day I ches yow to be myn,  
<span id="an_133"></span> Withoute repentynge, myn herte swete!"  
<span id="an_134"></span> And therwithal here bekes gonne mete,  
<span id="an_135"></span> \[Yelding\] honour and humble obeysaunces;  
<span id="an_136"></span> And after diden othere observaunces  
<span id="an_137"></span> Ryht \[longing\] onto love and to nature;  
<span id="an_138"></span> So ech of hem \[doth\] \[wel\] to creature.  
<span id="an_139"></span> This song to herkenen I dide al myn entente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> For-why I
mette I wiste what they mente,  
<span id="an_141"></span> Tyl at the laste a larke son above:  
<span id="an_142"></span> "I se," quod she, "the myghty god of Love.  
<span id="an_143"></span> Lo! yond he cometh! I se his wynges sprede."  
<span id="an_144"></span> Tho gan I loken endelong the mede  
<span id="an_145"></span> And saw hym come, and in his hond a quene  
<span id="an_146"></span> Clothed in real habyt al of grene.  
<span id="an_147"></span> A fret of goold she hadde next hyre her  
<span id="an_148"></span> And upon that a whit corone she ber  
<span id="an_149"></span> With many floures, and I shal nat lye;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> For al the
world, ryght as the dayesye  
<span id="an_151"></span> Ycorouned is with white leves lite,  
<span id="an_152"></span> Swiche were the floures of hire coroune
white.  
<span id="an_153"></span> For of o perle fyn and oryental  
<span id="an_154"></span> Hyre white coroun was ymaked al;  
<span id="an_155"></span> For which the white coroun above the grene  
<span id="an_156"></span> Made hire lyk a dayesye for to sene,  
<span id="an_157"></span> Considered ek the fret of gold above.  
<span id="an_158"></span> Yclothed was this myghty god of Love  
<span id="an_159"></span> Of silk, ybrouded ful of grene greves,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> A garlond on
his hed of rose-leves  
<span id="an_161"></span> Stiked al with lylye floures newe.  
<span id="an_162"></span> But of his face I can not seyn the hewe,  
<span id="an_163"></span> For sikerly his face shon so bryghte  
<span id="an_164"></span> That with the glem astoned was the syghte;  
<span id="an_165"></span> A furlong-wey I myhte hym not beholde.  
<span id="an_166"></span> But at the laste in hande I saw hym holde  
<span id="an_167"></span> Two firy dartes as the gleedes rede,  
<span id="an_168"></span> And aungellych hys winges gan he sprede.  
<span id="an_169"></span> And al be that men seyn that blynd is he,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> Algate me
thoughte he myghte wel yse;  
<span id="an_171"></span> For sternely on me he gan beholde,  
<span id="an_172"></span> So that his lokynge doth myn herte colde.  
<span id="an_173"></span> And by the hond he held the noble quene  
<span id="an_174"></span> Corouned with whit and clothed al in grene,  
<span id="an_175"></span> So womanly, so benygne, and so meke,  
<span id="an_176"></span> That in this world, thogh that men wolde
seke,  
<span id="an_177"></span> Half hire beaute shulde men nat fynde  
<span id="an_178"></span> In creature that formed is by kynde.  
<span id="an_179"></span> Hire name was Alceste the debonayre.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> I preye to
God that evere falle she fayre,  
<span id="an_181"></span> For ne hadde confort been of hire presence,

<span id="an_183"></span> For dred of Loves wordes and his chere,  
<span id="an_184"></span> As, whan tyme is, hereafter ye shal here.  
<span id="an_185"></span> Byhynde this god of Love, upon this grene,  
<span id="an_186"></span> I saw comynge of ladyes nyntene  
<span id="an_187"></span> In real habyt, a ful esy pas,

<span id="an_416"></span> And mad the lyf also of Seynt Cecile.  
<span id="an_417"></span> He made also, gon is a gret while,
