### The Complaint of Mars

<span id="an_1"></span> Gladeth, ye foules, of the morowe gray;  
<span id="an_2"></span> Lo, Venus, rysen among yon rowes rede.  
<span id="an_3"></span> And floures fressh, honoureth ye this day,  
<span id="an_4"></span> For when the sunne uprist then wol ye sprede.  
<span id="an_5"></span> But ye lovers, that lye in any drede,  
<span id="an_6"></span> Fleeth, lest wikked tonges yow espye.  
<span id="an_7"></span> Lo, yond the sunne, the candel of jelosye!  
<span id="an_8"></span> Wyth teres blewe and with a wounded herte  
<span id="an_9"></span> Taketh your leve, and with Seint John to
borowe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Apeseth sumwhat
of your sorowes smerte.  
<span id="an_11"></span> Tyme cometh eft that cese shal your sorowe;  
<span id="an_12"></span> The glade nyght ys worth an hevy morowe --  
<span id="an_13"></span> Seynt Valentyne, a foul thus herde I synge  
<span id="an_14"></span> Upon thy day er sonne gan up-sprynge.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Yet sang this foul -- I rede yow al awake,  
<span id="an_16"></span> And ye that han not chosen in humble wyse,  
<span id="an_17"></span> Without repentynge cheseth yow your make,  
<span id="an_18"></span> And ye that han ful chosen as I devise,  
<span id="an_19"></span> Yet at the leste renoveleth your servyse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> Confermeth hyt
perpetuely to dure,  
<span id="an_21"></span> And paciently taketh your aventure.  
<span id="an_22"></span> And for the worship of this highe feste,  
<span id="an_23"></span> Yet wol I, in my briddes wise, synge  
<span id="an_24"></span> The sentence of the compleynt, at the leste,  
<span id="an_25"></span> That woful Mars made atte departyng  
<span id="an_26"></span> Fro fresshe Venus in a morwenynge,  
<span id="an_27"></span> Whan Phebus with his firy torches rede  
<span id="an_28"></span> Ransaked every lover in hys drede.  
<span id="an_29"></span> Whilom the thridde hevenes lord above,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> As wel by
hevenysh revolucioun  
<span id="an_31"></span> As by desert, hath wonne Venus his love,  
<span id="an_32"></span> And she hath take him in subjeccioun,  
<span id="an_33"></span> And as a maistresse taught him his lessoun,  
<span id="an_34"></span> Commaundynge him that nevere, in her servise,  
<span id="an_35"></span> He nere so bold no lover to dispise.  
<span id="an_36"></span> For she forbad him jelosye at al,  
<span id="an_37"></span> And cruelte, and bost, and tyrannye.  
<span id="an_38"></span> She made him at her lust so humble and tal,  
<span id="an_39"></span> That when her deyned to cast on hym her ye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> He tok in
pacience to lyve or dye.  
<span id="an_41"></span> And thus she brydeleth him in her manere,  
<span id="an_42"></span> With nothing but with scourging of her chere.  
<span id="an_43"></span> Who regneth now in blysse but Venus,  
<span id="an_44"></span> That hath thys worthy knyght in governaunce?  
<span id="an_45"></span> Who syngeth now but Mars, that serveth thus  
<span id="an_46"></span> The faire Venus, causer of plesaunce?  
<span id="an_47"></span> He bynt him to perpetuall obeisaunce,  
<span id="an_48"></span> And she bynt her to loven him for evere,  
<span id="an_49"></span> But so be that his trespas hyt desevere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> Thus be they
knyt and regnen as in hevene  
<span id="an_51"></span> Be lokyng moost; til hyt fil on a tyde  
<span id="an_52"></span> That by her bothe assent was set a stevene  
<span id="an_53"></span> That Mars shal entre, as fast as he may
glyde,  
<span id="an_54"></span> Into hir nexte paleys, and ther abyde,  
<span id="an_55"></span> Walkynge hys cours, til she had him atake,  
<span id="an_56"></span> And he preide her to haste her for his sake.  
<span id="an_57"></span> Then seyde he thus, "Myn hertes lady swete,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Ye knowe wel my myschef in that place,  
<span id="an_59"></span> For sikerly, til that I with yow mete,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> My lyf stant
ther in aventure and grace;  
<span id="an_61"></span> But when I se the beaute of your face,  
<span id="an_62"></span> Ther ys no drede of deth may do me smerte,  
<span id="an_63"></span> For al your lust is ese to myn herte."  
<span id="an_64"></span> She hath so gret compassioun of her knyght,  
<span id="an_65"></span> That dwelleth in solitude til she come --  
<span id="an_66"></span> For hyt stod so that thilke tyme no wight  
<span id="an_67"></span> Counseyled hym ther, ne seyde to hym welcome
--  
<span id="an_68"></span> That nygh her wit for wo was overcome;  
<span id="an_69"></span> Wherfore she sped her as faste in her weye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Almost in oo
day as he dyde in tweye.  
<span id="an_71"></span> The grete joye that was betwix hem two  
<span id="an_72"></span> When they be mette ther may no tunge telle.  
<span id="an_73"></span> Ther is no more but unto bed thei go,  
<span id="an_74"></span> And thus in joy and blysse I lete hem duelle.  
<span id="an_75"></span> This worthi Mars, that is of knyghthod welle,  
<span id="an_76"></span> The flour of feyrnesse lappeth in his armes,  
<span id="an_77"></span> And Venus kysseth Mars, the god of armes.  
<span id="an_78"></span> Sojourned hath this Mars of which I rede  
<span id="an_79"></span> In chambre amyd the paleys prively  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> A certeyn tyme,
til him fel a drede  
<span id="an_81"></span> Throgh Phebus, that was comen hastely  
<span id="an_82"></span> Within the paleys yates sturdely,  
<span id="an_83"></span> With torche in honde, of which the stremes
bryghte  
<span id="an_84"></span> On Venus chambre knokkeden ful lyghte.  
<span id="an_85"></span> The chambre ther as ley this fresshe quene  
<span id="an_86"></span> Depeynted was with white boles grete,  
<span id="an_87"></span> And by the lyght she knew, that shon so
shene,  
<span id="an_88"></span> That Phebus cam to brenne hem with his hete.  
<span id="an_89"></span> This sely Venus nygh dreynt in teres wete  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Enbraceth Mars
and seyde, "Alas, I dye!  
<span id="an_91"></span> The torche is come that al this world wol
wrie."  
<span id="an_92"></span> Up sterte Mars; hym liste not to slepe  
<span id="an_93"></span> When he his lady herde so compleyne,  
<span id="an_94"></span> But, for his nature was not for to wepe,  
<span id="an_95"></span> In stede of teres, from his eyen tweyne  
<span id="an_96"></span> The firi sparkes brosten out for peyne,  
<span id="an_97"></span> And hente his hauberk that ley hym besyde.  
<span id="an_98"></span> Fle wolde he not, ne myghte himselven hide.  
<span id="an_99"></span> He throweth on his helm of huge wyghte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> And girt him
with his swerd, and in his hond  
<span id="an_101"></span> His myghty spere, as he was wont to fyghte,  
<span id="an_102"></span> He shaketh so that almost hit towond.  
<span id="an_103"></span> Ful hevy was he to walken over lond;  
<span id="an_104"></span> He may not holde with Venus companye  
<span id="an_105"></span> But bad her fleen lest Phebus her espye.  
<span id="an_106"></span> O woful Mars -- alas -- what maist thou
seyn,  
<span id="an_107"></span> That in the paleys of thy disturbaunce  
<span id="an_108"></span> Art left byhynde in peril to be sleyn?  
<span id="an_109"></span> And yet therto ys double thy penaunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> For she that
hath thyn herte in governaunce  
<span id="an_111"></span> Is passed half the stremes of thin yen;  
<span id="an_112"></span> That thou nere swift, wel maist thou wepe and
crien.  
<span id="an_113"></span> Now fleeth Venus unto Cilenios tour  
<span id="an_114"></span> With voide cours for fere of Phebus lyght --  
<span id="an_115"></span> Alas -- and ther ne hath she no socour,  
<span id="an_116"></span> For she ne found ne saugh no maner wyght,  
<span id="an_117"></span> And eke as ther she hath but litil myght,  
<span id="an_118"></span> Wherfor, herselven for to hyde and save,  
<span id="an_119"></span> Within the gate she fledde into a cave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> Derk was this
cave and smokyng as the helle;  
<span id="an_121"></span> Not but two pas within the yate hit stod.  
<span id="an_122"></span> A naturel day in derk I lete her duelle.  
<span id="an_123"></span> Now wol I speke of Mars, furious and wod.  
<span id="an_124"></span> For sorow he wolde have sen his herte blod;  
<span id="an_125"></span> Sith that he myghte don her no companye,  
<span id="an_126"></span> He ne roghte not a myte for to dye.  
<span id="an_127"></span> So feble he wex for hete and for his wo  
<span id="an_128"></span> That nygh he swelte, he myghte unnethe
endure;  
<span id="an_129"></span> He passeth but o steyre in dayes two.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> But
nathelesse, for al his hevy armure,  
<span id="an_131"></span> He foloweth her that is his lyves cure,  
<span id="an_132"></span> For whos departyng he tok gretter ire  
<span id="an_133"></span> Then for al his brennyng in the fire.  
<span id="an_134"></span> After he walketh softely a paas,  
<span id="an_135"></span> Compleynyng, that hyt pite was to here,  
<span id="an_136"></span> He seyde, "O lady bryght, Venus, alas,  
<span id="an_137"></span> That evere so wyd a compas ys my spere!  
<span id="an_138"></span> Alas, when shal I mete yow, herte dere?  
<span id="an_139"></span> This twelfte daye of April I endure  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Throgh jelous
Phebus this mysaventure."  
<span id="an_141"></span> Now God helpe sely Venus allone.  
<span id="an_142"></span> But as God wolde, hyt happed for to be  
<span id="an_143"></span> That, while that Venus weping made her mone,  
<span id="an_144"></span> Cilenius, rydinge in his chevache,  
<span id="an_145"></span> Fro Venus valaunse myghte his paleys se,  
<span id="an_146"></span> And Venus he salueth and doth chere,  
<span id="an_147"></span> And her receyveth as his frend ful dere.  
<span id="an_148"></span> Mars dwelleth forth in his adversyte,  
<span id="an_149"></span> Compleynyng ever on her departynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> And what his
compleynt was, remembreth me;  
<span id="an_151"></span> And therfore, in this lusty morwenynge  
<span id="an_152"></span> As I best can, I wol hit seyn and synge;  
<span id="an_153"></span> And after that I wol my leve take,  
<span id="an_154"></span> And God yeve every wyght joy of his make!  
<span id="an_155"></span> The ordre of compleynt requireth skylfully  
<span id="an_156"></span> That yf a wight shal pleyne pitously,  
<span id="an_157"></span> Ther mot be cause wherfore that men pleyne;  
<span id="an_158"></span> Or men may deme he pleyneth folily  
<span id="an_159"></span> And causeles; alas, that am not I.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> Wherfore the
ground and cause of al my peyne,  
<span id="an_161"></span> So as my troubled wit may hit atteyne,  
<span id="an_162"></span> I wol reherse; not for to have redresse,  
<span id="an_163"></span> But to declare my ground of hevynesse.  
<span id="an_164"></span> The firste tyme, alas, that I was wroght  
<span id="an_165"></span> And for certeyn effectes hider broght  
<span id="an_166"></span> Be him that lordeth ech intelligence,  
<span id="an_167"></span> I yaf my trewe servise and my thoght  
<span id="an_168"></span> For evermore -- how dere I have hit boght --  
<span id="an_169"></span> To her that is of so gret excellence  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> That what
wight that first sheweth his presence,  
<span id="an_171"></span> When she is wroth and taketh of hym no cure,  
<span id="an_172"></span> He may not longe in joye of love endure.  
<span id="an_173"></span> This is no feyned mater that I telle;  
<span id="an_174"></span> My lady is the verrey sours and welle  
<span id="an_175"></span> Of beaute, lust, fredom, and gentilnesse,  
<span id="an_176"></span> Of riche aray -- how dere men hit selle! --  
<span id="an_177"></span> Of al disport in which men frendly duelle,  
<span id="an_178"></span> Of love and pley, and of benigne humblesse,  
<span id="an_179"></span> Of soun of instrumentes of al swetnesse;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> And therto so
wel fortuned and thewed  
<span id="an_181"></span> That thorogh the world her goodnesse is
yshewed.  
<span id="an_182"></span> What wonder ys it then, thogh I besette  
<span id="an_183"></span> My servise on such on that may me knette  
<span id="an_184"></span> To wele or wo sith hit lyth in her myght?  
<span id="an_185"></span> Therfore my herte forever I to her hette,  
<span id="an_186"></span> Ne truly, for my deth, I shal not lette  
<span id="an_187"></span> To ben her truest servaunt and her knyght.  
<span id="an_188"></span> I flater noght, that may wete every wyght;  
<span id="an_189"></span> For this day in her servise shal I dye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> But grace be,
I se her never wyth ye.  
<span id="an_191"></span> To whom shal I than pleyne of my distresse?  
<span id="an_192"></span> Who may me helpe? Who may my harm redresse?  
<span id="an_193"></span> Shal I compleyne unto my lady fre?  
<span id="an_194"></span> Nay, certes, for she hath such hevynesse,  
<span id="an_195"></span> For fere and eke for wo that, as I gesse,  
<span id="an_196"></span> In lytil tyme hit wol her bane be.  
<span id="an_197"></span> But were she sauf, hit were no fors of me.  
<span id="an_198"></span> Alas, that ever lovers mote endure  
<span id="an_199"></span> For love so many a perilous aventure!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> For thogh so
be that lovers be as trewe  
<span id="an_201"></span> As any metal that is forged newe,  
<span id="an_202"></span> In many a cas hem tydeth ofte sorowe.  
<span id="an_203"></span> Somtyme her lady wil not on hem rewe;  
<span id="an_204"></span> Somtyme yf that jelosie hyt knewe,  
<span id="an_205"></span> They myghten lyghtly leye her hed to borowe;  
<span id="an_206"></span> Somtyme envyous folk with tunges horowe  
<span id="an_207"></span> Depraven hem; alas, whom may they plese?  
<span id="an_208"></span> But he be fals, no lover hath non ese.  
<span id="an_209"></span> But what availeth such a long sermoun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> Of aventures
of love up and doun?  
<span id="an_211"></span> I wol returne and speken of my peyne.  
<span id="an_212"></span> The poynt is this of my distruccioun:  
<span id="an_213"></span> My righte lady, my savacyoun,  
<span id="an_214"></span> Is in affray, and not to whom to pleyne.  
<span id="an_215"></span> O herte swete, O lady sovereyne!  
<span id="an_216"></span> For your disese wel oughte I swowne and
swelte,  
<span id="an_217"></span> Though I non other harm ne drede felte.  
<span id="an_218"></span> To what fyn made the God, that sit so hye,  
<span id="an_219"></span> Benethen him love other companye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> And streyneth
folk to love, malgre her hed?  
<span id="an_221"></span> And then her joy, for oght I can espye,  
<span id="an_222"></span> Ne lasteth not the twynkelyng of an ye,  
<span id="an_223"></span> And somme han never joy til they be ded.  
<span id="an_224"></span> What meneth this? What is this mystihed?  
<span id="an_225"></span> Wherto constreyneth he his folk so faste  
<span id="an_226"></span> Thing to desyre, but hit shulde laste?  
<span id="an_227"></span> And thogh he made a lover love a thing  
<span id="an_228"></span> And maketh hit seme stedfast and during,  
<span id="an_229"></span> Yet putteth he in hyt such mysaventure  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> That reste
nys ther non in his yeving.  
<span id="an_231"></span> And that is wonder, that so juste a kyng  
<span id="an_232"></span> Doth such hardnesse to his creature.  
<span id="an_233"></span> Thus, whether love breke or elles dure,  
<span id="an_234"></span> Algates he that hath with love to done  
<span id="an_235"></span> Hath ofter wo then changed ys the mone.  
<span id="an_236"></span> Hit semeth he hath to lovers enmyte,  
<span id="an_237"></span> And lyk a fissher, as men alday may se,  
<span id="an_238"></span> Baiteth hys angle-hok with som plesaunce  
<span id="an_239"></span> Til many a fissh ys wod til that he be  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> Sesed
therwith; and then at erst hath he  
<span id="an_241"></span> Al his desir, and therwith al myschaunce;  
<span id="an_242"></span> And thogh the lyne breke, he hath penaunce;  
<span id="an_243"></span> For with the hok he wounded is so sore  
<span id="an_244"></span> That he his wages hath for evermore.  
<span id="an_245"></span> The broche of Thebes was of such a kynde,  
<span id="an_246"></span> So ful of rubies and of stones of Ynde  
<span id="an_247"></span> That every wight, that sette on hit an ye,  
<span id="an_248"></span> He wende anon to worthe out of his mynde;  
<span id="an_249"></span> So sore the beaute wolde his herte bynde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> Til he hit
had, him thoghte he moste dye;  
<span id="an_251"></span> And whan that hit was his, then shulde he
drye  
<span id="an_252"></span> Such woo for drede, ay while that he hit
hadde,  
<span id="an_253"></span> That wel nygh for the fere he shulde madde.  
<span id="an_254"></span> And whan hit was fro his possessioun,  
<span id="an_255"></span> Then had he double wo and passioun  
<span id="an_256"></span> For he so feir a tresor had forgo;  
<span id="an_257"></span> But yet this broche as in conclusioun  
<span id="an_258"></span> Was not the cause of his confusioun,  
<span id="an_259"></span> But he that wroghte hit enfortuned hit so  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> That every
wight that had hit shulde have wo;  
<span id="an_261"></span> And therfore in the worcher was the vice,  
<span id="an_262"></span> And in the covetour that was so nyce.  
<span id="an_263"></span> So fareth hyt by lovers and by me;  
<span id="an_264"></span> For thogh my lady have so gret beaute  
<span id="an_265"></span> That I was mad til I had gete her grace,  
<span id="an_266"></span> She was not cause of myn adversite,  
<span id="an_267"></span> But he that wroghte her, also mot I the,
