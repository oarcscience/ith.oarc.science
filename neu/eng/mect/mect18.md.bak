#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Clerk's Tale

<span id="an_57"></span> Ther is, at the west syde of Ytaille,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Doun at the roote of Vesulus the colde,  
<span id="an_59"></span> A lusty playn, habundant of vitaille,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Where many a
tour and toun thou mayst biholde,  
<span id="an_61"></span> That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,  
<span id="an_62"></span> And many another delitable sighte,  
<span id="an_63"></span> And Saluces this noble contree highte.  
<span id="an_64"></span> A markys whilom lord was of that lond,  
<span id="an_65"></span> As were his worthy eldres hym bifore;  
<span id="an_66"></span> And obeisant, ay redy to his hond,  
<span id="an_67"></span> Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and moore.  
<span id="an_68"></span> Thus in delit he lyveth, and hath doon yoore,  
<span id="an_69"></span> Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of Fortune,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Bothe of his
lordes and of his commune.  
<span id="an_71"></span> Therwith he was, to speke as of lynage,  
<span id="an_72"></span> The gentilleste yborn of Lumbardye,  
<span id="an_73"></span> A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,  
<span id="an_74"></span> And ful of honour and of curteisye;  
<span id="an_75"></span> Discreet ynogh his contree for to gye,  
<span id="an_76"></span> Save in somme thynges that he was to blame;  
<span id="an_77"></span> And Walter was this yonge lordes name.  
<span id="an_78"></span> I blame hym thus: that he considered noght  
<span id="an_79"></span> In tyme comynge what myghte hym bityde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> But on his lust
present was al his thoght,  
<span id="an_81"></span> As for to hauke and hunte on every syde.  
<span id="an_82"></span> Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde,  
<span id="an_83"></span> And eek he nolde -- and that was worst of alle
--  
<span id="an_84"></span> Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle.  
<span id="an_85"></span> Oonly that point his peple bar so soore  
<span id="an_86"></span> That flokmeele on a day they to hym wente,  
<span id="an_87"></span> And oon of hem, that wisest was of loore --  
<span id="an_88"></span> Or elles that the lord best wolde assente  
<span id="an_89"></span> That he sholde telle hym what his peple
mente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Or elles koude
he shewe wel swich mateere --  
<span id="an_91"></span> He to the markys seyde as ye shul heere:  
<span id="an_92"></span> "O noble markys, youre humanitee  
<span id="an_93"></span> Asseureth us and yeveth us hardinesse,  
<span id="an_94"></span> As ofte as tyme is of necessitee,  
<span id="an_95"></span> That we to yow mowe telle oure hevynesse.  
<span id="an_96"></span> Accepteth, lord, now of youre gentillesse  
<span id="an_97"></span> That we with pitous herte unto yow pleyne,  
<span id="an_98"></span> And lat youre eres nat my voys desdeyne.  
<span id="an_99"></span> "Al have I noght to doone in this mateere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> Moore than
another man hath in this place,  
<span id="an_101"></span> Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so deere,  
<span id="an_102"></span> Han alwey shewed me favour and grace  
<span id="an_103"></span> I dar the bettre aske of yow a space  
<span id="an_104"></span> Of audience to shewen oure requeste,  
<span id="an_105"></span> And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste.  
<span id="an_106"></span> "For certes, lord, so wel us liketh yow  
<span id="an_107"></span> And al youre werk, and evere han doon, that

<span id="an_108"></span> Ne koude nat us self devysen how  
<span id="an_109"></span> We myghte lyven in moore felicitee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Save o thyng,
lord, if it youre wille be,  
<span id="an_111"></span> That for to been a wedded man yow leste;  
<span id="an_112"></span> Thanne were youre peple in sovereyn hertes
reste.  
<span id="an_113"></span> "Boweth youre nekke under that blisful yok  
<span id="an_114"></span> Of soveraynetee, noght of servyse,  
<span id="an_115"></span> Which that men clepe spousaille or wedlok;  
<span id="an_116"></span> And thenketh, lord, among youre thoghtes
wyse  
<span id="an_117"></span> How that oure dayes passe in sondry wyse,  
<span id="an_118"></span> For thogh we slepe, or wake, or rome, or

<span id="an_119"></span> Ay fleeth the tyme; it nyl no man abyde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> "And thogh

<span id="an_121"></span> In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon,  
<span id="an_122"></span> And deeth manaceth every age, and smyt  
<span id="an_123"></span> In ech estaat, for ther escapeth noon;  
<span id="an_124"></span> And al so certein as we knowe echoon  
<span id="an_125"></span> That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle  
<span id="an_126"></span> Been of that day whan deeth shal on us
falle.  
<span id="an_127"></span> "Accepteth thanne of us the trewe entente,  
<span id="an_128"></span> That nevere yet refuseden youre heeste,  
<span id="an_129"></span> And we wol, lord, if that ye wole assente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Chese yow a
wyf, in short tyme atte leeste,  
<span id="an_131"></span> Born of the gentilleste and of the meeste  
<span id="an_132"></span> Of al this land, so that it oghte seme  
<span id="an_133"></span> Honour to God and yow, as we kan deeme.  
<span id="an_134"></span> "Delivere us out of al this bisy drede,  
<span id="an_135"></span> And taak a wyf, for hye Goddes sake!  
<span id="an_136"></span> For if it so bifelle, as God forbede,  
<span id="an_137"></span> That thurgh youre deeth youre lyne sholde
slake,  
<span id="an_138"></span> And that a straunge successour sholde take  
<span id="an_139"></span> Youre heritage, O wo were us alyve!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Wherfore we
pray you hastily to wyve."  
<span id="an_141"></span> Hir meeke preyere and hir pitous cheere  
<span id="an_142"></span> Made the markys herte han pitee.  
<span id="an_143"></span> "Ye wol," quod he, "myn owene peple deere,  
<span id="an_144"></span> To that I nevere erst thoughte streyne me.  
<span id="an_145"></span> I me rejoysed of my liberte,

<span id="an_162"></span> "Lat me allone in chesynge of my wyf --  
<span id="an_163"></span> That charge upon my bak I wole endure.  
<span id="an_164"></span> But I yow preye, and charge upon youre lyf,  
<span id="an_165"></span> What wyf that I take, ye me assure  
<span id="an_166"></span> To worshipe hire, whil that hir lyf may

<span id="an_176"></span> With hertely wyl they sworen and assenten  
<span id="an_177"></span> To al this thyng -- ther seyde no wight nay

<span id="an_178"></span> Bisekynge hym of grace, er that they wenten,  
<span id="an_179"></span> That he wolde graunten hem a certein day  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> Of his

<span id="an_181"></span> For yet alwey the peple somwhat dredde,  
<span id="an_182"></span> Lest that the markys no wyf wolde wedde.  
<span id="an_183"></span> He graunted hem a day, swich as hym leste,  
<span id="an_184"></span> On which he wolde be wedded sikerly,  
<span id="an_185"></span> And seyde he dide al this at hir requeste.  
<span id="an_186"></span> And they, with humble entente, buxomly,  
<span id="an_187"></span> Knelynge upon hir knees ful reverently,

<span id="an_189"></span> Of hire entente, and hoom agayn they wende.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> And heerupon

<span id="an_196"></span> To doon unto the feeste reverence.  
<span id="an_197"></span> Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable,  
<span id="an_198"></span> Wher as this markys shoop his mariage,  
<span id="an_199"></span> There stood a throop, of site delitable,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> In which that
povre folk of that village  
<span id="an_201"></span> Hadden hir beestes and hir herbergage,  
<span id="an_202"></span> And of hire labour tooke hir sustenance,  
<span id="an_203"></span> After that the erthe yaf hem habundance.  
<span id="an_204"></span> Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man  
<span id="an_205"></span> Which that was holden povrest of hem alle;  
<span id="an_206"></span> But hye God somtyme senden kan  
<span id="an_207"></span> His grace into a litel oxes stalle;  
<span id="an_208"></span> Janicula men of that throop hym calle.  
<span id="an_209"></span> A doghter hadde he, fair ynogh to sighte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> And Grisildis
this yonge mayden highte.  
<span id="an_211"></span> But for to speke of vertuous beautee,  
<span id="an_212"></span> Thanne was she oon the faireste under sonne;  
<span id="an_213"></span> For povreliche yfostred up was she,  
<span id="an_214"></span> No likerous lust was thurgh hire herte
yronne.  
<span id="an_215"></span> Wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne  
<span id="an_216"></span> She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese,  
<span id="an_217"></span> She knew wel labour but noon ydel ese.  
<span id="an_218"></span> But thogh this mayde tendre were of age,

<span id="an_221"></span> And in greet reverence and charitee  
<span id="an_222"></span> Hir olde povre fader fostred shee.  
<span id="an_223"></span> A fewe sheep, spynnynge, on feeld she kepte;  
<span id="an_224"></span> She wolde noght been ydel til she slepte.  
<span id="an_225"></span> And whan she homward cam, she wolde brynge  
<span id="an_226"></span> Wortes or othere herbes tymes ofte,  
<span id="an_227"></span> The whiche she shredde and seeth for hir

<span id="an_231"></span> That child may doon to fadres reverence.  
<span id="an_232"></span> Upon Grisilde, this povre creature,  
<span id="an_233"></span> Ful ofte sithe this markys sette his ye  
<span id="an_234"></span> As he on huntyng rood paraventure;

<span id="an_238"></span> Upon hir chiere he wolde hym ofte avyse,  
<span id="an_239"></span> Commendynge in his herte hir wommanhede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> And eek hir

<span id="an_241"></span> Of so yong age, as wel in chiere as dede.  
<span id="an_242"></span> For thogh the peple have no greet insight  
<span id="an_243"></span> In vertu, he considered ful right  
<span id="an_244"></span> Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde  
<span id="an_245"></span> Wedde hire oonly, if evere he wedde sholde.  
<span id="an_246"></span> The day of weddyng cam, but no wight kan  
<span id="an_247"></span> Telle what womman that it sholde be;  
<span id="an_248"></span> For which merveille wondred many a man,  
<span id="an_249"></span> And seyden, whan they were in privetee,

<span id="an_251"></span> Wol he nat wedde? Allas! Allas, the while!  
<span id="an_252"></span> Why wole he thus hymself and us bigile?"  
<span id="an_253"></span> But nathelees this markys hath doon make  
<span id="an_254"></span> Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure,  
<span id="an_255"></span> Brooches and rynges, for Grisildis sake;  
<span id="an_256"></span> And of hir clothyng took he the mesure  
<span id="an_257"></span> By a mayde lyk to hire stature,  
<span id="an_258"></span> And eek of othere aornementes alle

<span id="an_321"></span> I wol no thyng, ye be my lord so deere;  
<span id="an_322"></span> Right as yow lust, governeth this mateere."  
<span id="an_323"></span> "Yet wol I," quod this markys softely,  
<span id="an_324"></span> "That in thy chambre I and thou and she  
<span id="an_325"></span> Have a collacioun, and wostow why?  
<span id="an_326"></span> For I wol axe if it hire wille be  
<span id="an_327"></span> To be my wyf and reule hire after me.  
<span id="an_328"></span> And al this shal be doon in thy presence;  
<span id="an_329"></span> I wol noght speke out of thyn audience."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> And in the
chambre, whil they were aboute  
<span id="an_331"></span> Hir tretys, which as ye shal after heere,  
<span id="an_332"></span> The peple cam unto the hous withoute,  
<span id="an_333"></span> And wondred hem in how honest manere  
<span id="an_334"></span> And tentifly she kepte hir fader deere.  
<span id="an_335"></span> But outrely Grisildis wondre myghte,  
<span id="an_336"></span> For nevere erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.  
<span id="an_337"></span> No wonder is thogh that she were astoned  
<span id="an_338"></span> To seen so greet a gest come in that place;  
<span id="an_339"></span> She nevere was to swiche gestes woned,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> For which she
looked with ful pale face.  
<span id="an_341"></span> But shortly forth this matere for to chace,  
<span id="an_342"></span> Thise arn the wordes that the markys sayde  
<span id="an_343"></span> To this benigne, verray, feithful mayde:  
<span id="an_344"></span> "Grisilde," he seyde, "ye shal wel
understonde  
<span id="an_345"></span> It liketh to youre fader and to me  
<span id="an_346"></span> That I yow wedde, and eek it may so stonde,  
<span id="an_347"></span> As I suppose, ye wol that it so be.  
<span id="an_348"></span> But thise demandes axe I first," quod he,  
<span id="an_349"></span> "That, sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> Wol ye
assente, or elles yow avyse?  
<span id="an_351"></span> "I seye this: be ye redy with good herte  
<span id="an_352"></span> To al my lust, and that I frely may,  
<span id="an_353"></span> As me best thynketh, do yow laughe or
smerte,  
<span id="an_354"></span> And nevere ye to grucche it, nyght ne day?  
<span id="an_355"></span> And eek whan I sey \`ye,' ne sey nat \`nay,'  
<span id="an_356"></span> Neither by word ne frownyng contenance?  
<span id="an_357"></span> Swere this, and heere I swere oure
alliance."  
<span id="an_358"></span> Wondrynge upon this word, quakynge for
drede,  
<span id="an_359"></span> She seyde, "Lord, undigne and unworthy  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> Am I to
thilke honour that ye me beede,  
<span id="an_361"></span> But as ye wole youreself, right so wol I.  
<span id="an_362"></span> And heere I swere that nevere willyngly,  
<span id="an_363"></span> In werk ne thoght, I nyl yow disobeye,  
<span id="an_364"></span> For to be deed, though me were looth to
deye."  
<span id="an_365"></span> "This is ynogh, Grisilde myn," quod he.  
<span id="an_366"></span> And forth he gooth with a ful sobre cheere  
<span id="an_367"></span> Out at the dore, and after that cam she,  
<span id="an_368"></span> And to the peple he seyde in this manere:  
<span id="an_369"></span> "This is my wyf," quod he, "that standeth
heere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> Honoureth
hire and loveth hire, I preye,  
<span id="an_371"></span> Whoso me loveth; ther is namoore to seye."  
<span id="an_372"></span> And for that no thyng of hir olde geere  
<span id="an_373"></span> She sholde brynge into his hous, he bad  
<span id="an_374"></span> That wommen sholde dispoillen hire right
theere;  
<span id="an_375"></span> Of which thise ladyes were nat right glad  
<span id="an_376"></span> To handle hir clothes, wherinne she was
clad.  
<span id="an_377"></span> But nathelees, this mayde bright of hewe  
<span id="an_378"></span> Fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe.  
<span id="an_379"></span> Hir heris han they kembd, that lay untressed  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> Ful rudely,
and with hir fyngres smale  
<span id="an_381"></span> A corone on hire heed they han ydressed,  
<span id="an_382"></span> And sette hire ful of nowches grete and
smale.  
<span id="an_383"></span> Of hire array what sholde I make a tale?  
<span id="an_384"></span> Unnethe the peple hir knew for hire
fairnesse  
<span id="an_385"></span> Whan she translated was in swich richesse.  
<span id="an_386"></span> This markys hath hire spoused with a ryng  
<span id="an_387"></span> Broght for the same cause, and thanne hire
sette  
<span id="an_388"></span> Upon an hors, snow-whit and wel amblyng,  
<span id="an_389"></span> And to his paleys, er he lenger lette,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> With joyful
peple that hire ladde and mette,  
<span id="an_391"></span> Conveyed hire; and thus the day they spende  
<span id="an_392"></span> In revel, til the sonne gan descende.  
<span id="an_393"></span> And shortly forth this tale for to chace,  
<span id="an_394"></span> I seye that to this newe markysesse  
<span id="an_395"></span> God hath swich favour sent hire of his grace  
<span id="an_396"></span> That it ne semed nat by liklynesse  
<span id="an_397"></span> That she was born and fed in rudenesse,  
<span id="an_398"></span> As in a cote or in an oxe-stalle,  
<span id="an_399"></span> But norissed in an emperoures halle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> To every
wight she woxen is so deere  
<span id="an_401"></span> And worshipful that folk ther she was bore,  
<span id="an_402"></span> And from hire birthe knewe hire yeer by
yeere,  
<span id="an_403"></span> Unnethe trowed they -- but dorste han swore
--  
<span id="an_404"></span> That to Janicle, of which I spak bifore,  
<span id="an_405"></span> She doghter were, for, as by conjecture,  
<span id="an_406"></span> Hem thoughte she was another creature.  
<span id="an_407"></span> For though that evere vertuous was she,  
<span id="an_408"></span> She was encressed in swich excellence  
<span id="an_409"></span> Of thewes goode, yset in heigh bountee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> And so
discreet and fair of eloquence,  
<span id="an_411"></span> So benigne and so digne of reverence,  
<span id="an_412"></span> And koude so the peples herte embrace,  
<span id="an_413"></span> That ech hire lovede that looked on hir
face.  
<span id="an_414"></span> Noght oonly of Saluces in the toun  
<span id="an_415"></span> Publiced was the bountee of hir name,  
<span id="an_416"></span> But eek biside in many a regioun,  
<span id="an_417"></span> If oon seide wel, another seyde the same;  
<span id="an_418"></span> So spradde of hire heighe bountee the fame  
<span id="an_419"></span> That men and wommen, as wel yonge as olde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> Goon to
Saluce upon hire to biholde.  
<span id="an_421"></span> Thus Walter lowely -- nay, but roially --  
<span id="an_422"></span> Wedded with fortunat honestetee,  
<span id="an_423"></span> In Goddes pees lyveth ful esily  
<span id="an_424"></span> At hoom, and outward grace ynogh had he;  
<span id="an_425"></span> And for he saugh that under low degree  
<span id="an_426"></span> Was ofte vertu hid, the peple hym heelde  
<span id="an_427"></span> A prudent man, and that is seyn ful seelde.  
<span id="an_428"></span> Nat oonly this Grisildis thurgh hir wit  
<span id="an_429"></span> Koude al the feet of wyfly hoomlinesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> But eek, whan
that the cas required it,  
<span id="an_431"></span> The commune profit koude she redresse.  
<span id="an_432"></span> Ther nas discord, rancour, ne hevynesse  
<span id="an_433"></span> In al that land that she ne koude apese,  
<span id="an_434"></span> And wisely brynge hem alle in reste and ese.  
<span id="an_435"></span> Though that hire housbonde absent were anon,  
<span id="an_436"></span> If gentil men or othere of hire contree  
<span id="an_437"></span> Were wrothe, she wolde bryngen hem aton;  
<span id="an_438"></span> So wise and rype wordes hadde she,  
<span id="an_439"></span> And juggementz of so greet equitee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> That she from
hevene sent was, as men wende,  
<span id="an_441"></span> Peple to save and every wrong t' amende.  
<span id="an_442"></span> Nat longe tyme after that this Grisild  
<span id="an_443"></span> Was wedded, she a doghter hath ybore,  
<span id="an_444"></span> Al had hire levere have born a knave child;  
<span id="an_445"></span> Glad was this markys and the folk therfore,  
<span id="an_446"></span> For though a mayde child coome al bifore,  
<span id="an_447"></span> She may unto a knave child atteyne  
<span id="an_448"></span> By liklihede, syn she nys nat bareyne.  
<span id="an_449"></span> Ther fil, as it bifalleth tymes mo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> Whan that
this child had souked but a throwe,  
<span id="an_451"></span> This markys in his herte longeth so  
<span id="an_452"></span> To tempte his wyf, hir sadnesse for to
knowe,  
<span id="an_453"></span> That he ne myghte out of his herte throwe  
<span id="an_454"></span> This merveillous desir his wyf t' assaye;  
<span id="an_455"></span> Nedelees, God woot, he thoghte hire for t'
affraye.  
<span id="an_456"></span> He hadde assayed hire ynogh bifore,  
<span id="an_457"></span> And foond hire evere good; what neded it  
<span id="an_458"></span> Hire for to tempte, and alwey moore and
moore,  
<span id="an_459"></span> Though som men preise it for a subtil wit?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> But as for
me, I seye that yvele it sit  
<span id="an_461"></span> To assaye a wyf whan that it is no nede,  
<span id="an_462"></span> And putten hire in angwyssh and in drede.  
<span id="an_463"></span> For which this markys wroghte in this
manere:  
<span id="an_464"></span> He cam allone a-nyght, ther as she lay,  
<span id="an_465"></span> With stierne face and with ful trouble
cheere,  
<span id="an_466"></span> And seyde thus: "Grisilde," quod he, "that
day  
<span id="an_467"></span> That I yow took out of youre povere array,  
<span id="an_468"></span> And putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse --  
<span id="an_469"></span> Ye have nat that forgeten, as I gesse?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> "I seye,

<span id="an_481"></span> They seyn, to hem it is greet shame and wo  
<span id="an_482"></span> For to be subgetz and been in servage  
<span id="an_483"></span> To thee, that born art of a smal village.  
<span id="an_484"></span> "And namely sith thy doghter was ybore  
<span id="an_485"></span> Thise wordes han they spoken, doutelees.  
<span id="an_486"></span> But I desire, as I have doon bifore,

<span id="an_497"></span> That day that maked was oure mariage."  
<span id="an_498"></span> Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved  
<span id="an_499"></span> Neither in word, or chiere, or contenaunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> For, as it
semed, she was nat agreved.  
<span id="an_501"></span> She seyde, "Lord, al lyth in youre

<span id="an_511"></span> Ne chaunge my corage to another place."  
<span id="an_512"></span> Glad was this markys of hire answeryng,  
<span id="an_513"></span> But yet he feyned as he were nat so;  
<span id="an_514"></span> Al drery was his cheere and his lookyng,  
<span id="an_515"></span> Whan that he sholde out of the chambre go.  
<span id="an_516"></span> Soone after this, a furlong wey or two,  
<span id="an_517"></span> He prively hath toold al his entente  
<span id="an_518"></span> Unto a man, and to his wyf hym sente.  
<span id="an_519"></span> A maner sergeant was this privee man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> The which
that feithful ofte he founden hadde  
<span id="an_521"></span> In thynges grete, and eek swich folk wel kan

<span id="an_523"></span> The lord knew wel that he hym loved and
dradde;  
<span id="an_524"></span> And whan this sergeant wiste his lordes

<span id="an_525"></span> Into the chambre he stalked hym ful stille.  
<span id="an_526"></span> "Madame," he seyde, "ye moote foryeve it me,

<span id="an_533"></span> "This child I am comanded for to take" --  
<span id="an_534"></span> And spak namoore, but out the child he hente  
<span id="an_535"></span> Despitously, and gan a cheere make  
<span id="an_536"></span> As though he wolde han slayn it er he wente.  
<span id="an_537"></span> Grisildis moot al suffre and al consente,  
<span id="an_538"></span> And as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille,  
<span id="an_539"></span> And leet this crueel sergeant doon his

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> Suspecious
was the diffame of this man,  
<span id="an_541"></span> Suspect his face, suspect his word also;  
<span id="an_542"></span> Suspect the tyme in which he this bigan.  
<span id="an_543"></span> Allas! Hir doghter that she loved so,  
<span id="an_544"></span> She wende he wolde han slawen it right tho.  
<span id="an_545"></span> But nathelees she neither weep ne syked,  
<span id="an_546"></span> Conformynge hire to that the markys lyked.  
<span id="an_547"></span> But atte laste to speken she bigan,  
<span id="an_548"></span> And mekely she to the sergeant preyde,  
<span id="an_549"></span> So as he was a worthy gentil man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> That she
moste kisse hire child er that it deyde.  
<span id="an_551"></span> And in hir barm this litel child she leyde  
<span id="an_552"></span> With ful sad face, and gan the child to
blisse,  
<span id="an_553"></span> And lulled it, and after gan it kisse.  
<span id="an_554"></span> And thus she seyde in hire benigne voys,  
<span id="an_555"></span> "Fareweel my child! I shal thee nevere see.  
<span id="an_556"></span> But sith I thee have marked with the croys

<span id="an_561"></span> I trowe that to a norice in this cas

<span id="an_563"></span> Wel myghte a mooder thanne han cryd "allas!"  
<span id="an_564"></span> But nathelees so sad stidefast was she  
<span id="an_565"></span> That she endured al adversitee,  
<span id="an_566"></span> And to the sergeant mekely she sayde,  
<span id="an_567"></span> "Have heer agayn youre litel yonge mayde.  
<span id="an_568"></span> "Gooth now," quod she, "and dooth my lordes

<span id="an_575"></span> This sergeant cam unto his lord ageyn,

<span id="an_603"></span> As glad, as humble, as bisy in servyse,

<span id="an_621"></span> O nedelees was she tempted in assay!  
<span id="an_622"></span> But wedded men ne knowe no mesure,

<span id="an_671"></span> And forth he goth with drery contenance,

<span id="an_684"></span> But she noon answere of hym myghte have.  
<span id="an_685"></span> He wente his wey, as hym no thyng ne roghte,  
<span id="an_686"></span> But to Boloigne he tendrely it broghte.  
<span id="an_687"></span> This markys wondred, evere lenger the moore,  
<span id="an_688"></span> Upon hir pacience, and if that he  
<span id="an_689"></span> Ne hadde soothly knowen therbifoore  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> That parfitly
hir children loved she,  
<span id="an_691"></span> He wolde have wend that of som subtiltee,  
<span id="an_692"></span> And of malice, or for crueel corage,  
<span id="an_693"></span> That she hadde suffred this with sad visage.  
<span id="an_694"></span> But wel he knew that next hymself, certayn,  
<span id="an_695"></span> She loved hir children best in every wyse.  
<span id="an_696"></span> But now of wommen wolde I axen fayn  
<span id="an_697"></span> If thise assayes myghte nat suffise?  
<span id="an_698"></span> What koude a sturdy housbonde moore devyse  
<span id="an_699"></span> To preeve hir wyfhod and hir stedefastnesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> And he
continuynge evere in sturdinesse?  
<span id="an_701"></span> But ther been folk of swich condicion  
<span id="an_702"></span> That whan they have a certein purpos take,  
<span id="an_703"></span> They kan nat stynte of hire entencion,  
<span id="an_704"></span> But, right as they were bounden to that
stake,  
<span id="an_705"></span> They wol nat of that firste purpos slake.  
<span id="an_706"></span> Right so this markys fulliche hath purposed  
<span id="an_707"></span> To tempte his wyf as he was first disposed.  
<span id="an_708"></span> He waiteth if by word or contenance  
<span id="an_709"></span> That she to hym was changed of corage,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> But nevere
koude he fynde variance.  
<span id="an_711"></span> She was ay oon in herte and in visage,  
<span id="an_712"></span> And ay the forther that she was in age,  
<span id="an_713"></span> The moore trewe, if that it were possible,  
<span id="an_714"></span> She was to hym in love, and moore penyble.  
<span id="an_715"></span> For which it semed thus: that of hem two  
<span id="an_716"></span> Ther nas but o wyl, for as Walter leste,  
<span id="an_717"></span> The same lust was hire plesance also.  
<span id="an_718"></span> And, God be thanked, al fil for the beste.  
<span id="an_719"></span> She shewed wel, for no worldly unreste  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> A wyf, as of
hirself, nothing ne sholde  
<span id="an_721"></span> Wille in effect, but as hir housbonde wolde.  
<span id="an_722"></span> The sclaundre of Walter ofte and wyde
spradde,  
<span id="an_723"></span> That of a crueel herte he wikkedly,  
<span id="an_724"></span> For he a povre womman wedded hadde,  
<span id="an_725"></span> Hath mordred bothe his children prively.  
<span id="an_726"></span> Swich murmur was among hem comunly.  
<span id="an_727"></span> No wonder is, for to the peples ere  
<span id="an_728"></span> Ther cam no word but that they mordred were.  
<span id="an_729"></span> For which, where as his peple therbifore  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730">730</span></span> Hadde loved
hym wel, the sclaundre of his diffame  
<span id="an_731"></span> Made hem that they hym hatede therfore.  
<span id="an_732"></span> To been a mordrere is an hateful name;  
<span id="an_733"></span> But nathelees, for ernest ne for game,  
<span id="an_734"></span> He of his crueel purpos nolde stente;  
<span id="an_735"></span> To tempte his wyf was set al his entente.  
<span id="an_736"></span> Whan that his doghter twelve yeer was of
age,  
<span id="an_737"></span> He to the court of Rome, in subtil wyse  
<span id="an_738"></span> Enformed of his wyl, sente his message,  
<span id="an_739"></span> Comaundynge hem swiche bulles to devyse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> As to his
crueel purpos may suffyse --  
<span id="an_741"></span> How that the pope, as for his peples reste,  
<span id="an_742"></span> Bad hym to wedde another, if hym leste.  
<span id="an_743"></span> I seye, he bad they sholde countrefete  
<span id="an_744"></span> The popes bulles, makynge mencion  
<span id="an_745"></span> That he hath leve his firste wyf to lete,  
<span id="an_746"></span> As by the popes dispensacion,  
<span id="an_747"></span> To stynte rancour and dissencion  
<span id="an_748"></span> Bitwixe his peple and hym; thus seyde the
bulle,  
<span id="an_749"></span> The which they han publiced atte fulle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> The rude
peple, as it no wonder is,  
<span id="an_751"></span> Wenden ful wel that it hadde be right so;  
<span id="an_752"></span> But whan thise tidynges came to Grisildis,  
<span id="an_753"></span> I deeme that hire herte was ful wo.  
<span id="an_754"></span> But she, ylike sad for everemo,  
<span id="an_755"></span> Disposed was, this humble creature,  
<span id="an_756"></span> The adversitee of Fortune al t' endure,  
<span id="an_757"></span> Abidynge evere his lust and his plesance,  
<span id="an_758"></span> To whom that she was yeven herte and al,  
<span id="an_759"></span> As to hire verray worldly suffisance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> But shortly
if this storie I tellen shal,  
<span id="an_761"></span> This markys writen hath in special  
<span id="an_762"></span> A lettre, in which he sheweth his entente,  
<span id="an_763"></span> And secreely he to Boloigne it sente.  
<span id="an_764"></span> To the Erl of Panyk, which that hadde tho  
<span id="an_765"></span> Wedded his suster, preyde he specially  
<span id="an_766"></span> To bryngen hoom agayn his children two  
<span id="an_767"></span> In honurable estaat al openly.  
<span id="an_768"></span> But o thyng he hym preyede outrely,  
<span id="an_769"></span> That he to no wight, though men wolde
enquere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> Sholde nat
telle whos children that they were,  
<span id="an_771"></span> But seye the mayden sholde ywedded be  
<span id="an_772"></span> Unto the Markys of Saluce anon.  
<span id="an_773"></span> And as this erl was preyed, so dide he;  
<span id="an_774"></span> For at day set he on his wey is goon  
<span id="an_775"></span> Toward Saluce, and lordes many oon  
<span id="an_776"></span> In riche array, this mayden for to gyde,  
<span id="an_777"></span> Hir yonge brother ridynge hire bisyde.  
<span id="an_778"></span> Arrayed was toward hir mariage  
<span id="an_779"></span> This fresshe mayde, ful of gemmes cleere;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_780">780</span></span> Hir brother,
which that seven yeer was of age,  
<span id="an_781"></span> Arrayed eek ful fressh in his manere.  
<span id="an_782"></span> And thus in greet noblesse and with glad

<span id="an_783"></span> Toward Saluces shapynge hir journey,  
<span id="an_784"></span> Fro day to day they ryden in hir wey.  
<span id="an_785"></span> Among al this, after his wikke usage,

<span id="an_788"></span> Fully to han experience and loore  
<span id="an_789"></span> If that she were as stidefast as bifoore,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_790">790</span></span> He on a day
in open audience  
<span id="an_791"></span> Ful boistously hath seyd hire this sentence:  
<span id="an_792"></span> "Certes, Grisilde, I hadde ynogh plesance

<span id="an_1116"></span> And strepen hire out of hire rude array,

<span id="an_1119"></span> Upon hire heed, they into halle hire

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120">1120</span></span> And ther

<span id="an_1129"></span> Lyven thise two in concord and in reste,

<span id="an_1132"></span> Of al Ytaille; and thanne in pees and reste  
<span id="an_1133"></span> His wyves fader in his court he kepeth,  
<span id="an_1134"></span> Til that the soule out of his body crepeth.  
<span id="an_1135"></span> His sone succedeth in his heritage  
<span id="an_1136"></span> In reste and pees, after his fader day,  
<span id="an_1137"></span> And fortunat was eek in mariage,  
<span id="an_1138"></span> Al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay.  
<span id="an_1139"></span> This world is nat so strong, it is no nay,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140">1140</span></span> As it hath
been in olde tymes yoore,  
<span id="an_1141"></span> And herkneth what this auctour seith

<span id="an_1142"></span> This storie is seyd nat for that wyves
sholde  
<span id="an_1143"></span> Folwen Grisilde as in humylitee,  
<span id="an_1144"></span> For it were inportable, though they wolde,  
<span id="an_1145"></span> But for that every wight, in his degree,  
<span id="an_1146"></span> Sholde be constant in adversitee  
<span id="an_1147"></span> As was Grisilde; therfore Petrak writeth  
<span id="an_1148"></span> This storie, which with heigh stile he
enditeth.  
<span id="an_1149"></span> For sith a womman was so pacient  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1150">1150</span></span> Unto a
mortal man, wel moore us oghte  
<span id="an_1151"></span> Receyven al in gree that God us sent;  
<span id="an_1152"></span> For greet skile is he preeve that he
wroghte.  
<span id="an_1153"></span> But he ne tempteth no man that he boghte,  
<span id="an_1154"></span> As seith Seint Jame, if ye his pistel rede;  
<span id="an_1155"></span> He preeveth folk al day, it is no drede,  
<span id="an_1156"></span> And suffreth us, as for oure excercise,  
<span id="an_1157"></span> With sharpe scourges of adversitee  
<span id="an_1158"></span> Ful ofte to be bete in sondry wise;  
<span id="an_1159"></span> Nat for to knowe oure wyl, for certes he,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> Er we were
born, knew al oure freletee;  
<span id="an_1161"></span> And for oure beste is al his governaunce.  
<span id="an_1162"></span> Lat us thanne lyve in vertuous suffraunce.  
<span id="an_1163"></span> But o word, lordynges, herkneth er I go:  
<span id="an_1164"></span> It were ful hard to fynde now-a-dayes  
<span id="an_1165"></span> In al a toun Grisildis thre or two;  
<span id="an_1166"></span> For if that they were put to swiche
assayes,  
<span id="an_1167"></span> The gold of hem hath now so badde alayes  
<span id="an_1168"></span> With bras, that thogh the coyne be fair at
ye,  
<span id="an_1169"></span> It wolde rather breste a-two than plye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1170">1170</span></span> For which
heere, for the Wyves love of Bathe --  
<span id="an_1171"></span> Whos lyf and al hire secte God mayntene  
<span id="an_1172"></span> In heigh maistrie, and elles were it scathe
--  
<span id="an_1173"></span> I wol with lusty herte, fressh and grene,  
<span id="an_1174"></span> Seyn yow a song to glade yow, I wene;  
<span id="an_1175"></span> And lat us stynte of ernestful matere.  
<span id="an_1176"></span> Herkneth my song that seith in this manere:  
<span id="an_1177"></span> Grisilde is deed, and eek hire pacience,  
<span id="an_1178"></span> And bothe atones buryed in Ytaille;  
<span id="an_1179"></span> For which I crie in open audience  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1180">1180</span></span> No wedded
man so hardy be t' assaille  
<span id="an_1181"></span> His wyves pacience in trust to fynde  
<span id="an_1182"></span> Grisildis, for in certein he shal faille.  
<span id="an_1183"></span> O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence,  
<span id="an_1184"></span> Lat noon humylitee youre tonge naille,  
<span id="an_1185"></span> Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence  
<span id="an_1186"></span> To write of yow a storie of swich mervaille  
<span id="an_1187"></span> As of Grisildis pacient and kynde,  
<span id="an_1188"></span> Lest Chichevache yow swelwe in hire
entraille!  
<span id="an_1189"></span> Folweth Ekko, that holdeth no silence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190">1190</span></span> But evere
answereth at the countretaille.  
<span id="an_1191"></span> Beth nat bidaffed for youre innocence,  
<span id="an_1192"></span> But sharply taak on yow the governaille.  
<span id="an_1193"></span> Emprenteth wel this lessoun in youre mynde,  
<span id="an_1194"></span> For commune profit sith it may availle.  
<span id="an_1195"></span> Ye archewyves, stondeth at defense,  
<span id="an_1196"></span> Syn ye be strong as is a greet camaille;  
<span id="an_1197"></span> Ne suffreth nat that men yow doon offense.  
<span id="an_1198"></span> And sklendre wyves, fieble as in bataille,  
<span id="an_1199"></span> Beth egre as is a tygre yond in Ynde;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> Ay clappeth
as a mille, I yow consaille.  
<span id="an_1201"></span> Ne dreed hem nat; doth hem no reverence,  
<span id="an_1202"></span> For though thyn housbonde armed be in
maille,  
<span id="an_1203"></span> The arwes of thy crabbed eloquence  
<span id="an_1204"></span> Shal perce his brest and eek his

<span id="an_1205"></span> In jalousie I rede eek thou hym bynde,  
<span id="an_1206"></span> And thou shalt make hym couche as doth a

<span id="an_1207"></span> If thou be fair, ther folk been in
presence,  
<span id="an_1208"></span> Shewe thou thy visage and thyn apparaille;  
<span id="an_1209"></span> If thou be foul, be fre of thy dispence;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> To gete
thee freendes ay do thy travaille;  
<span id="an_1211"></span> Be ay of chiere as light as leef on lynde,  
<span id="an_1212"></span> And lat hym care, and wepe, and wrynge, and
waille!  
<span id="an_1212a"></span> \[This worthy Clerk, whan ended was his
tale,  
<span id="an_1212b"></span> Oure Hooste seyde, and swoor, "By Goddes
