#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Man of Law's Tale

<span id="an_134"></span> In Surrye whilom dwelte a compaignye  
<span id="an_135"></span> Of chapmen riche, and therto sadde and
trewe,  
<span id="an_136"></span> That wyde-where senten hir spicerye,  
<span id="an_137"></span> Clothes of gold, and satyns riche of hewe.  
<span id="an_138"></span> Hir chaffare was so thrifty and so newe  
<span id="an_139"></span> That every wight hath deyntee to chaffare  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> With hem, and
eek to sellen hem hire ware.  
<span id="an_141"></span> Now fil it that the maistres of that sort  
<span id="an_142"></span> Han shapen hem to Rome for to wende;  
<span id="an_143"></span> Were it for chapmanhod or for disport,  
<span id="an_144"></span> Noon oother message wolde they thider sende,  
<span id="an_145"></span> But comen hemself to Rome; this is the ende.  
<span id="an_146"></span> And in swich place as thoughte hem avantage  
<span id="an_147"></span> For hire entente, they take hir herbergage.  
<span id="an_148"></span> Sojourned han thise merchantz in that toun  
<span id="an_149"></span> A certein tyme, as fil to hire plesance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> And so bifel
that th' excellent renoun  
<span id="an_151"></span> Of the Emperoures doghter, dame Custance,  
<span id="an_152"></span> Reported was, with every circumstance,  
<span id="an_153"></span> Unto thise Surryen marchantz in swich wyse,  
<span id="an_154"></span> Fro day to day, as I shal yow devyse.  
<span id="an_155"></span> This was the commune voys of every man:  
<span id="an_156"></span> "Oure Emperour of Rome -- God hym see! --  
<span id="an_157"></span> A doghter hath that, syn the world bigan,  
<span id="an_158"></span> To rekene as wel hir goodnesse as beautee,  
<span id="an_159"></span> Nas nevere swich another as is shee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> I prey to God
in honour hire susteene,  
<span id="an_161"></span> And wolde she were of al Europe the queene.  
<span id="an_162"></span> "In hire is heigh beautee, withoute pride,  
<span id="an_163"></span> Yowthe, withoute grenehede or folye;  
<span id="an_164"></span> To alle hire werkes vertu is hir gyde;  
<span id="an_165"></span> Humblesse hath slayn in hire al tirannye.  
<span id="an_166"></span> She is mirour of alle curteisye;  
<span id="an_167"></span> Hir herte is verray chambre of hoolynesse,  
<span id="an_168"></span> Hir hand, ministre of fredam for almesse."  
<span id="an_169"></span> And al this voys was sooth, as God is trewe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> But now to
purpos lat us turne agayn.  
<span id="an_171"></span> Thise marchantz han doon fraught hir shippes
newe,  
<span id="an_172"></span> And whan they han this blisful mayden sayn,  
<span id="an_173"></span> Hoom to Surrye been they went ful fayn,  
<span id="an_174"></span> And doon hir nedes as they han doon yoore,  
<span id="an_175"></span> And lyven in wele; I kan sey yow namoore.  
<span id="an_176"></span> Now fil it that thise marchantz stode in
grace  
<span id="an_177"></span> Of hym that was the Sowdan of Surrye;  
<span id="an_178"></span> For whan they cam from any strange place,  
<span id="an_179"></span> He wolde, of his benigne curteisye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> Make hem good
chiere, and bisily espye  
<span id="an_181"></span> Tidynges of sondry regnes, for to leere  
<span id="an_182"></span> The wondres that they myghte seen or heere.  
<span id="an_183"></span> Amonges othere thynges, specially,  
<span id="an_184"></span> Thise marchantz han hym toold of dame
Custance  
<span id="an_185"></span> So greet noblesse in ernest, ceriously,  
<span id="an_186"></span> That this Sowdan hath caught so greet
plesance  
<span id="an_187"></span> To han hir figure in his remembrance,  
<span id="an_188"></span> That al his lust and al his bisy cure  
<span id="an_189"></span> Was for to love hire while his lyf may dure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> Paraventure
in thilke large book  
<span id="an_191"></span> Which that men clepe the hevene ywriten was  
<span id="an_192"></span> With sterres, whan that he his birthe took,  
<span id="an_193"></span> That he for love sholde han his deeth,
allas!  
<span id="an_194"></span> For in the sterres, clerer than is glas,  
<span id="an_195"></span> Is writen, God woot, whoso koude it rede,  
<span id="an_196"></span> The deeth of every man, withouten drede.  
<span id="an_197"></span> In sterres, many a wynter therbiforn,  
<span id="an_198"></span> Was writen the deeth of Ector, Achilles,  
<span id="an_199"></span> Of Pompei, Julius, er they were born;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> The strif of
Thebes; and of Ercules,  
<span id="an_201"></span> Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates  
<span id="an_202"></span> The deeth; but mennes wittes ben so dulle  
<span id="an_203"></span> That no wight kan wel rede it atte fulle.  
<span id="an_204"></span> This Sowdan for his privee conseil sente,  
<span id="an_205"></span> And, shortly of this matiere for to pace,  
<span id="an_206"></span> He hath to hem declared his entente,  
<span id="an_207"></span> And seyde hem, certein, but he myghte have
grace  
<span id="an_208"></span> To han Custance withinne a litel space,  
<span id="an_209"></span> He nas but deed; and charged hem in hye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> To shapen for
his lyf som remedye.  
<span id="an_211"></span> Diverse men diverse thynges seyden;  
<span id="an_212"></span> They argumenten, casten up and doun;  
<span id="an_213"></span> Many a subtil resoun forth they leyden;  
<span id="an_214"></span> They speken of magyk and abusioun.  
<span id="an_215"></span> But finally, as in conclusioun,  
<span id="an_216"></span> They kan nat seen in that noon avantage,  
<span id="an_217"></span> Ne in noon oother wey, save mariage.  
<span id="an_218"></span> Thanne sawe they therinne swich difficultee  
<span id="an_219"></span> By wey of reson, for to speke al playn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> By cause that
ther was swich diversitee  
<span id="an_221"></span> Bitwene hir bothe lawes, that they sayn  
<span id="an_222"></span> They trowe that no "Cristen prince wolde
fayn  
<span id="an_223"></span> Wedden his child under oure lawe sweete  
<span id="an_224"></span> That us was taught by Mahoun, oure
prophete."  
<span id="an_225"></span> And he answerde, "Rather than I lese  
<span id="an_226"></span> Custance, I wol be cristned, doutelees.  
<span id="an_227"></span> I moot been hires; I may noon oother chese.  
<span id="an_228"></span> I prey yow hoold youre argumentz in pees;  
<span id="an_229"></span> Saveth my lyf, and beth noght recchelees  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> To geten hire
that hath my lyf in cure,  
<span id="an_231"></span> For in this wo I may nat longe endure."  
<span id="an_232"></span> What nedeth gretter dilatacioun?  
<span id="an_233"></span> I seye, by tretys and embassadrie,  
<span id="an_234"></span> And by the popes mediacioun,  
<span id="an_235"></span> And al the chirche, and al the chivalrie,  
<span id="an_236"></span> That in destruccioun of mawmettrie,  
<span id="an_237"></span> And in encrees of Cristes lawe deere,  
<span id="an_238"></span> They been acorded, so as ye shal heere:  
<span id="an_239"></span> How that the Sowdan and his baronage  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> And alle his
liges sholde ycristned be,  
<span id="an_241"></span> And he shal han Custance in mariage,  
<span id="an_242"></span> And certein gold, I noot what quantitee;  
<span id="an_243"></span> And heer-to founden sufficient suretee.  
<span id="an_244"></span> This same accord was sworn on eyther syde;  
<span id="an_245"></span> Now, faire Custance, almyghty God thee gyde!  
<span id="an_246"></span> Now wolde som men waiten, as I gesse,  
<span id="an_247"></span> That I sholde tellen al the purveiance  
<span id="an_248"></span> That th' Emperour, of his grete noblesse,  
<span id="an_249"></span> Hath shapen for his doghter, dame Custance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> Wel may men
knowen that so greet ordinance  
<span id="an_251"></span> May no man tellen in a litel clause  
<span id="an_252"></span> As was arrayed for so heigh a cause.  
<span id="an_253"></span> Bisshopes been shapen with hire for to

<span id="an_254"></span> Lordes, ladies, knyghtes of renoun,  
<span id="an_255"></span> And oother folk ynowe; this is th' ende;  
<span id="an_256"></span> And notified is thurghout the toun

<span id="an_259"></span> Receyve in gree and spede this viage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> The day is

<span id="an_262"></span> That ther may be no lenger tariynge,  
<span id="an_263"></span> But forthward they hem dressen, alle and

<span id="an_264"></span> Custance, that was with sorwe al overcome,  
<span id="an_265"></span> Ful pale arist, and dresseth hire to wende;  
<span id="an_266"></span> For wel she seeth ther is noon oother ende.  
<span id="an_267"></span> Allas, what wonder is it thogh she wepte,  
<span id="an_268"></span> That shal be sent to strange nacioun  
<span id="an_269"></span> Fro freendes that so tendrely hire kepte,

<span id="an_313"></span> Namely to folk of heigh condicioun?  
<span id="an_314"></span> Noght whan a roote is of a burthe yknowe?  
<span id="an_315"></span> Allas, we been to lewed or to slowe!  
<span id="an_316"></span> To shippe is brought this woful faire mayde  
<span id="an_317"></span> Solempnely, with every circumstance.  
<span id="an_318"></span> "Now Jhesu Crist be with yow alle!" she

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> She peyneth

<span id="an_402"></span> Was roialler ne moore curius  
<span id="an_403"></span> Than was th' assemblee of this blisful

<span id="an_406"></span> Caste under this ful mortally to stynge.  
<span id="an_407"></span> The Sowdan comth hymself soone after this

<span id="an_409"></span> And welcometh hire with alle joye and blis.

<span id="an_428"></span> For shortly for to tellen, at o word,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> Been al

<span id="an_431"></span> But it were oonly dame Custance allone.

<span id="an_433"></span> Hath with hir freendes doon this cursed

<span id="an_435"></span> Ne ther was Surryen noon that was converted,  
<span id="an_436"></span> That of the conseil of the Sowdan woot,  
<span id="an_437"></span> That he nas al tohewe er he asterted.  
<span id="an_438"></span> And Custance han they take anon, foot-hoot,  
<span id="an_439"></span> And in a ship al steerelees, God woot,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> They han hir

<span id="an_441"></span> Out of Surrye agaynward to Ytaille.  
<span id="an_442"></span> A certein tresor that she thider ladde,

<span id="an_444"></span> They han hire yeven, and clothes eek she

<span id="an_445"></span> And forth she sailleth in the salte see.  
<span id="an_446"></span> O my Custance, ful of benignytee,

asken why she was nat slayn  
<span id="an_471"></span> Eek at the feeste? Who myghte hir body save?  
<span id="an_472"></span> And I answere to that demande agayn,  
<span id="an_473"></span> Who saved Danyel in the horrible cave  
<span id="an_474"></span> Ther every wight save he, maister and knave,

<span id="an_495"></span> Soothly, the comandour of that was he

<span id="an_502"></span> Fyve thousand folk it was as greet mervaille

<span id="an_514"></span> And foond this wery womman ful of care;  
<span id="an_515"></span> He foond also the tresor that she broghte.  
<span id="an_516"></span> In hir langage mercy she bisoghte,

<span id="an_518"></span> Hire to delivere of wo that she was inne.  
<span id="an_519"></span> A maner Latyn corrupt was hir speche,

<span id="an_522"></span> This woful womman broghte he to the londe.  
<span id="an_523"></span> She kneleth doun and thanketh Goddes sonde;  
<span id="an_524"></span> But what she was she wolde no man seye,  
<span id="an_525"></span> For foul ne fair, thogh that she sholde

<span id="an_526"></span> She seyde she was so mazed in the see  
<span id="an_527"></span> That she forgat hir mynde, by hir trouthe.  
<span id="an_528"></span> The constable hath of hire so greet pitee,  
<span id="an_529"></span> And eek his wyf, that they wepen for routhe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> She was so
diligent, withouten slouthe,  
<span id="an_531"></span> To serve and plesen everich in that place  
<span id="an_532"></span> That alle hir loven that looken in hir face.  
<span id="an_533"></span> This constable and dame Hermengyld, his wyf,  
<span id="an_534"></span> Were payens, and that contree everywhere;  
<span id="an_535"></span> But Hermengyld loved hire right as hir lyf,  
<span id="an_536"></span> And Custance hath so longe sojourned there,  
<span id="an_537"></span> In orisons, with many a bitter teere,  
<span id="an_538"></span> Til Jhesu hath converted thurgh his grace  
<span id="an_539"></span> Dame Hermengyld, constablesse of that place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> In al that

<span id="an_541"></span> Alle Cristen folk been fled fro that contree  
<span id="an_542"></span> Thurgh payens, that conquereden al aboute  
<span id="an_543"></span> The plages of the north, by land and see.  
<span id="an_544"></span> To Walys fledde the Cristyanytee  
<span id="an_545"></span> Of olde Britons dwellynge in this ile;  
<span id="an_546"></span> Ther was hir refut for the meene while.  
<span id="an_547"></span> But yet nere Cristene Britons so exiled  
<span id="an_548"></span> That ther nere somme that in hir privetee  
<span id="an_549"></span> Honoured Crist and hethen folk bigiled,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> And ny the

<span id="an_551"></span> That oon of hem was blynd and myghte nat

<span id="an_552"></span> But it were with thilke eyen of his mynde  
<span id="an_553"></span> With whiche men seen, after that they ben

<span id="an_554"></span> Bright was the sonne as in that someres day,  
<span id="an_555"></span> For which the constable and his wyf also  
<span id="an_556"></span> And Custance han ytake the righte way  
<span id="an_557"></span> Toward the see a furlong wey or two,  
<span id="an_558"></span> To pleyen and to romen to and fro,  
<span id="an_559"></span> And in hir walk this blynde man they mette,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> Croked and
oold, with eyen faste yshette.  
<span id="an_561"></span> "In name of Crist," cride this blinde
Britoun,  
<span id="an_562"></span> "Dame Hermengyld, yif me my sighte agayn!"  
<span id="an_563"></span> This lady weex affrayed of the soun,  
<span id="an_564"></span> Lest that hir housbonde, shortly for to
sayn,  
<span id="an_565"></span> Wolde hire for Jhesu Cristes love han slayn,  
<span id="an_566"></span> Til Custance made hire boold, and bad hire
wirche  
<span id="an_567"></span> The wyl of Crist, as doghter of his chirche.  
<span id="an_568"></span> The constable weex abasshed of that sight,  
<span id="an_569"></span> And seyde, "What amounteth al this fare?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> Custance
answerde, "Sire, it is Cristes myght,  
<span id="an_571"></span> That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare."  
<span id="an_572"></span> And so ferforth she gan oure lay declare  
<span id="an_573"></span> That she the constable, er that it was eve  
<span id="an_574"></span> Converteth, and on Crist made hym bileve.  
<span id="an_575"></span> This constable was nothyng lord of this
place  
<span id="an_576"></span> Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond,  
<span id="an_577"></span> But kepte it strongly many a wyntres space  
<span id="an_578"></span> Under Alla, kyng of al Northhumbrelond,  
<span id="an_579"></span> That was ful wys, and worthy of his hond  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> Agayn the
Scottes, as men may wel heere;  
<span id="an_581"></span> But turne I wole agayn to my mateere.  
<span id="an_582"></span> Sathan, that evere us waiteth to bigile,  
<span id="an_583"></span> Saugh of Custance al hire perfeccioun,  
<span id="an_584"></span> And caste anon how he myghte quite hir

<span id="an_585"></span> And made a yong knyght that dwelte in that
toun  
<span id="an_586"></span> Love hire so hoote, of foul affeccioun,  
<span id="an_587"></span> That verraily hym thoughte he sholde spille,  
<span id="an_588"></span> But he of hire myghte ones have his wille.  
<span id="an_589"></span> He woweth hire, but it availleth noght;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> She wolde do
no synne, by no weye.  
<span id="an_591"></span> And for despit he compassed in his thoght  
<span id="an_592"></span> To maken hire on shameful deeth to deye.  
<span id="an_593"></span> He wayteth whan the constable was aweye,  
<span id="an_594"></span> And pryvely upon a nyght he crepte  
<span id="an_595"></span> In Hermengyldes chambre, whil she slepte.  
<span id="an_596"></span> Wery, forwaked in hire orisouns,  
<span id="an_597"></span> Slepeth Custance, and Hermengyld also.  
<span id="an_598"></span> This knyght, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns,  
<span id="an_599"></span> Al softely is to the bed ygo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> And kitte the
throte of Hermengyld atwo,  
<span id="an_601"></span> And leyde the blody knyf by dame Custance,  
<span id="an_602"></span> And wente his wey, ther God yeve hym
meschance!  
<span id="an_603"></span> Soone after cometh this constable hoom
agayn,  
<span id="an_604"></span> And eek Alla, that kyng was of that lond,  
<span id="an_605"></span> And saugh his wyf despitously yslayn,  
<span id="an_606"></span> For which ful ofte he weep and wroong his

<span id="an_607"></span> And in the bed the blody knyf he fond  
<span id="an_608"></span> By Dame Custance. Allas, what myghte she

<span id="an_609"></span> For verray wo hir wit was al aweye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> To kyng Alla

<span id="an_611"></span> And eek the tyme, and where, and in what

<span id="an_612"></span> That in a ship was founden this Custance,  
<span id="an_613"></span> As heer-biforn that ye han herd devyse.  
<span id="an_614"></span> The kynges herte of pitee gan agryse,  
<span id="an_615"></span> Whan he saugh so benigne a creature  
<span id="an_616"></span> Falle in disese and in mysaventure.  
<span id="an_617"></span> For as the lomb toward his deeth is broght,  
<span id="an_618"></span> So stant this innocent bifore the kyng.  
<span id="an_619"></span> This false knyght, that hath this tresoun

<span id="an_621"></span> But nathelees, ther was greet moornyng  
<span id="an_622"></span> Among the peple, and seyn they kan nat gesse  
<span id="an_623"></span> That she had doon so greet a wikkednesse,  
<span id="an_624"></span> For they han seyn hire evere so vertuous,  
<span id="an_625"></span> And lovynge Hermengyld right as hir lyf.  
<span id="an_626"></span> Of this baar witnesse everich in that hous,  
<span id="an_627"></span> Save he that Hermengyld slow with his knyf.  
<span id="an_628"></span> This gentil kyng hath caught a greet motyf  
<span id="an_629"></span> Of this witnesse, and thoghte he wolde

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> Depper in

<span id="an_631"></span> Allas! Custance, thou hast no champioun,  
<span id="an_632"></span> Ne fighte kanstow noght, so weylaway!  
<span id="an_633"></span> But he that starf for our redempcioun,

<span id="an_635"></span> So be thy stronge champion this day!  
<span id="an_636"></span> For, but if Crist open myracle kithe,  
<span id="an_637"></span> Withouten gilt thou shalt be slayn as

<span id="an_638"></span> She sette hire doun on knees, and thus she

<span id="an_639"></span> "Immortal God, that savedest Susanne

<span id="an_666"></span> A Britoun book, written with Evaungiles,

<span id="an_687"></span> This false knyght was slayn for his

<span id="an_708"></span> They goon to bedde, as it was skile and

<span id="an_925"></span> O foule lust of luxurie, lo, thyn ende!  
<span id="an_926"></span> Nat oonly that thou feyntest mannes mynde,  
<span id="an_927"></span> But verraily thou wolt his body shende.  
<span id="an_928"></span> Th' ende of thy werk, or of thy lustes
blynde,  
<span id="an_929"></span> Is compleynyng. Hou many oon may men fynde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> That noght

<span id="an_931"></span> To doon this synne, been outher slayn or

<span id="an_932"></span> How may this wayke womman han this strengthe  
<span id="an_933"></span> Hire to defende agayn this renegat?  
<span id="an_934"></span> O Golias, unmesurable of lengthe,  
<span id="an_935"></span> Hou myghte David make thee so maat,  
<span id="an_936"></span> So yong and of armure so desolaat?  
<span id="an_937"></span> Hou dorste he looke upon thy dredful face?  
<span id="an_938"></span> Wel may men seen, it nas but Goddes grace.  
<span id="an_939"></span> Who yaf Judith corage or hardynesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> To sleen hym
Olofernus in his tente,  
<span id="an_941"></span> And to deliveren out of wrecchednesse  
<span id="an_942"></span> The peple of God? I seye, for this entente,  
<span id="an_943"></span> That right as God spirit of vigour sente  
<span id="an_944"></span> To hem and saved hem out of meschance,  
<span id="an_945"></span> So sente he myght and vigour to Custance.  
<span id="an_946"></span> Forth gooth hir ship thurghout the narwe
mouth  
<span id="an_947"></span> Of Jubaltare and Septe, dryvynge ay  
<span id="an_948"></span> Somtyme west, and somtyme north and south,  
<span id="an_949"></span> And somtyme est, ful many a wery day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> Til Cristes
mooder -- blessed be she ay! --  
<span id="an_951"></span> Hath shapen, thurgh hir endelees goodnesse,  
<span id="an_952"></span> To make an ende of al hir hevynesse.  
<span id="an_953"></span> Now lat us stynte of Custance but a throwe,  
<span id="an_954"></span> And speke we of the Romayn Emperour,  
<span id="an_955"></span> That out of Surrye hath by lettres knowe  
<span id="an_956"></span> The slaughtre of cristen folk, and dishonour  
<span id="an_957"></span> Doon to his doghter by a fals traytour,  
<span id="an_958"></span> I mene the cursed wikked Sowdanesse  
<span id="an_959"></span> That at the feeste leet sleen bothe moore and
lesse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_960">960</span></span> For which
this Emperour hath sent anon  
<span id="an_961"></span> His senatour, with roial ordinance,  
<span id="an_962"></span> And othere lordes, God woot, many oon,  
<span id="an_963"></span> On Surryens to taken heigh vengeance.  
<span id="an_964"></span> They brennen, sleen, and brynge hem to
meschance  
<span id="an_965"></span> Ful many a day; but shortly -- this is th'
ende --  
<span id="an_966"></span> Homward to Rome they shapen hem to wende.  
<span id="an_967"></span> This senatour repaireth with victorie  
<span id="an_968"></span> To Rome-ward, saillynge ful roially,  
<span id="an_969"></span> And mette the ship dryvynge, as seith the
storie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> In which
Custance sit ful pitously.  
<span id="an_971"></span> Nothyng ne knew he what she was, ne why  
<span id="an_972"></span> She was in swich array, ne she nyl seye  
<span id="an_973"></span> Of hire estaat, althogh she sholde deye.  
<span id="an_974"></span> He bryngeth hire to Rome, and to his wyf  
<span id="an_975"></span> He yaf hire, and hir yonge sone also;  
<span id="an_976"></span> And with the senatour she ladde hir lyf.  
<span id="an_977"></span> Thus kan Oure Lady bryngen out of wo  
<span id="an_978"></span> Woful Custance, and many another mo.  
<span id="an_979"></span> And longe tyme dwelled she in that place,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980">980</span></span> In hooly
werkes evere, as was hir grace.  
<span id="an_981"></span> The senatoures wyf hir aunte was,  
<span id="an_982"></span> But for al that she knew hire never the
moore.  
<span id="an_983"></span> I wol no lenger tarien in this cas,  
<span id="an_984"></span> But to kyng Alla, which I spak of yoore,  
<span id="an_985"></span> That for his wyf wepeth and siketh soore,  
<span id="an_986"></span> I wol retourne, and lete I wol Custance  
<span id="an_987"></span> Under the senatoures governance.  
<span id="an_988"></span> Kyng Alla, which that hadde his mooder
slayn,  
<span id="an_989"></span> Upon a day fil in swich repentance  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990">990</span></span> That, if I
shortly tellen shal and playn,  
<span id="an_991"></span> To Rome he comth to receyven his penance;  
<span id="an_992"></span> And putte hym in the Popes ordinance  
<span id="an_993"></span> In heigh and logh, and Jhesu Crist bisoghte  
<span id="an_994"></span> Foryeve his wikked werkes that he wroghte.  
<span id="an_995"></span> The fame anon thurgh Rome toun is born,  
<span id="an_996"></span> How Alla kyng shal comen in pilgrymage,  
<span id="an_997"></span> By herbergeours that wenten hym biforn;  
<span id="an_998"></span> For which the senatour, as was usage,  
<span id="an_999"></span> Rood hym agayns, and many of his lynage,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> As wel to
shewen his heighe magnificence  
<span id="an_1001"></span> As to doon any kyng a reverence.  
<span id="an_1002"></span> Greet cheere dooth this noble senatour  
<span id="an_1003"></span> To kyng Alla, and he to hym also;  
<span id="an_1004"></span> Everich of hem dooth oother greet honour.  
<span id="an_1005"></span> And so bifel that in a day or two  
<span id="an_1006"></span> This senatour is to kyng Alla go  
<span id="an_1007"></span> To feste, and shortly, if I shal nat lye,  
<span id="an_1008"></span> Custances sone wente in his compaignye.  
<span id="an_1009"></span> Som men wolde seyn at requeste of Custance  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> This
senatour hath lad this child to feeste;  
<span id="an_1011"></span> I may nat tellen every circumstance --  
<span id="an_1012"></span> Be as be may, ther was he at the leeste.  
<span id="an_1013"></span> But sooth is this, that at his moodres
heeste  
<span id="an_1014"></span> Biforn Alla, durynge the metes space,  
<span id="an_1015"></span> The child stood, lookynge in the kynges
face.  
<span id="an_1016"></span> This Alla kyng hath of this child greet
wonder,  
<span id="an_1017"></span> And to the senatour he seyde anon,  
<span id="an_1018"></span> "Whos is that faire child that stondeth
yonder?"  
<span id="an_1019"></span> "I noot," quod he, "by God, and by Seint
John!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020">1020</span></span> A mooder he
hath, but fader hath he noon  
<span id="an_1021"></span> That I of woot" -- and shortly, in a
stounde,  
<span id="an_1022"></span> He tolde Alla how that this child was
founde.  
<span id="an_1023"></span> "But God woot," quod this senatour also,  
<span id="an_1024"></span> "So vertuous a lyvere in my lyf  
<span id="an_1025"></span> Ne saugh I nevere as she, ne herde of mo,  
<span id="an_1026"></span> Of worldly wommen, mayde, ne of wyf.  
<span id="an_1027"></span> I dar wel seyn hir hadde levere a knyf  
<span id="an_1028"></span> Thurghout hir brest, than ben a womman
wikke;  
<span id="an_1029"></span> There is no man koude brynge hire to that
prikke."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030">1030</span></span> Now was
this child as lyk unto Custance  
<span id="an_1031"></span> As possible is a creature to be.  
<span id="an_1032"></span> This Alla hath the face in remembrance  
<span id="an_1033"></span> Of dame Custance, and ther on mused he  
<span id="an_1034"></span> If that the childes mooder were aught she  
<span id="an_1035"></span> That is his wyf, and pryvely he sighte,  
<span id="an_1036"></span> And spedde hym fro the table that he
myghte.  
<span id="an_1037"></span> "Parfay," thoghte he, "fantome is in myn
heed!  
<span id="an_1038"></span> I oghte deme, of skilful juggement,  
<span id="an_1039"></span> That in the salte see my wyf is deed."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1040">1040</span></span> And
afterward he made his argument:  
<span id="an_1041"></span> "What woot I if that Crist have hyder ysent  
<span id="an_1042"></span> My wyf by see, as wel as he hire sente  
<span id="an_1043"></span> To my contree fro thennes that she wente?"  
<span id="an_1044"></span> And after noon, hoom with the senatour  
<span id="an_1045"></span> Goth Alla, for to seen this wonder chaunce.  
<span id="an_1046"></span> This senatour dooth Alla greet honour,  
<span id="an_1047"></span> And hastifly he sente after Custaunce.  
<span id="an_1048"></span> But trusteth weel, hire liste nat to daunce  
<span id="an_1049"></span> Whan that she wiste wherfore was that
sonde;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1050">1050</span></span> Unnethe
upon hir feet she myghte stonde.  
<span id="an_1051"></span> Whan Alla saugh his wyf, faire he hire
grette,  
<span id="an_1052"></span> And weep that it was routhe for to see;  
<span id="an_1053"></span> For at the firste look he on hire sette  
<span id="an_1054"></span> He knew wel verraily that it was she.  
<span id="an_1055"></span> And she, for sorwe, as doumb stant as a
tree,  
<span id="an_1056"></span> So was hir herte shet in hir distresse,  
<span id="an_1057"></span> Whan she remembred his unkyndenesse.  
<span id="an_1058"></span> Twyes she swowned in his owene sighte;  
<span id="an_1059"></span> He weep, and hym excuseth pitously.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060">1060</span></span> "Now God,"
quod he, "and his halwes brighte  
<span id="an_1061"></span> So wisly on my soule as have mercy,  
<span id="an_1062"></span> That of youre harm as giltelees am I  
<span id="an_1063"></span> As is Maurice my sone, so lyk youre face;  
<span id="an_1064"></span> Elles the feend me fecche out of this
place!"  
<span id="an_1065"></span> Long was the sobbyng and the bitter peyne,  
<span id="an_1066"></span> Er that hir woful hertes myghte cesse;  
<span id="an_1067"></span> Greet was the pitee for to heere hem
pleyne,  
<span id="an_1068"></span> Thurgh whiche pleintes gan hir wo encresse.  
<span id="an_1069"></span> I pray yow alle my labour to relesse;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070">1070</span></span> I may nat
telle hir wo until to-morwe,  
<span id="an_1071"></span> I am so wery for to speke of sorwe.  
<span id="an_1072"></span> But finally, whan that the sothe is wist  
<span id="an_1073"></span> That Alla giltelees was of hir wo,  
<span id="an_1074"></span> I trowe an hundred tymes been they kist,  
<span id="an_1075"></span> And swich a blisse is ther bitwix hem two  
<span id="an_1076"></span> That, save the joye that lasteth everemo,  
<span id="an_1077"></span> Ther is noon lyk that any creature  
<span id="an_1078"></span> Hath seyn or shal, whil that the world may
dure.  
<span id="an_1079"></span> Tho preyde she hir housbonde mekely,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> In relief
of hir longe, pitous pyne,  
<span id="an_1081"></span> That he wolde preye hir fader specially  
<span id="an_1082"></span> That of his magestee he wolde enclyne  
<span id="an_1083"></span> To vouche sauf som day with hym to dyne.  
<span id="an_1084"></span> She preyde hym eek he sholde by no weye  
<span id="an_1085"></span> Unto hir fader no word of hire seye.  
<span id="an_1086"></span> Som men wolde seyn how that the child
Maurice  
<span id="an_1087"></span> Dooth this message unto this Emperour;  
<span id="an_1088"></span> But, as I gesse, Alla was nat so nyce  
<span id="an_1089"></span> To hym that was of so sovereyn honour  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090">1090</span></span> As he that
is of Cristen folk the flour,  
<span id="an_1091"></span> Sente any child, but it is bet to deeme  
<span id="an_1092"></span> He wente hymself, and so it may wel seeme.  
<span id="an_1093"></span> This Emperour hath graunted gentilly  
<span id="an_1094"></span> To come to dyner, as he hym bisoughte;  
<span id="an_1095"></span> And wel rede I he looked bisily  
<span id="an_1096"></span> Upon this child, and on his doghter
thoghte.  
<span id="an_1097"></span> Alla goth to his in, and as hym oghte,  
<span id="an_1098"></span> Arrayed for this feste in every wise  
<span id="an_1099"></span> As ferforth as his konnyng may suffise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100">1100</span></span> The morwe
cam, and Alla gan hym dresse,  
<span id="an_1101"></span> And eek his wyf, this Emperour to meete;  
<span id="an_1102"></span> And forth they ryde in joye and in
gladnesse.  
<span id="an_1103"></span> And whan she saugh hir fader in the strete,  
<span id="an_1104"></span> She lighte doun, and falleth hym to feete.  
<span id="an_1105"></span> "Fader," quod she, "youre yonge child
Custance  
<span id="an_1106"></span> Is now ful clene out of youre remembrance.  
<span id="an_1107"></span> "I am youre doghter Custance," quod she,  
<span id="an_1108"></span> "That whilom ye han sent unto Surrye.  
<span id="an_1109"></span> It am I, fader, that in the salte see  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1110">1110</span></span> Was put
allone and dampned for to dye.  
<span id="an_1111"></span> Now, goode fader, mercy I yow crye!  
<span id="an_1112"></span> Sende me namoore unto noon hethenesse,  
<span id="an_1113"></span> But thonketh my lord heere of his
kyndenesse."  
<span id="an_1114"></span> Who kan the pitous joye tellen al  
<span id="an_1115"></span> Bitwixe hem thre, syn they been thus
ymette?  
<span id="an_1116"></span> But of my tale make an ende I shal;  
<span id="an_1117"></span> The day goth faste, I wol no lenger lette.  
<span id="an_1118"></span> This glade folk to dyner they hem sette;  
<span id="an_1119"></span> In joye and blisse at mete I lete hem
dwelle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120">1120</span></span> A thousand
foold wel moore than I kan telle.  
<span id="an_1121"></span> This child Maurice was sithen Emperour  
<span id="an_1122"></span> Maad by the Pope, and lyved cristenly;  
<span id="an_1123"></span> To Cristes chirche he dide greet honour.  
<span id="an_1124"></span> But I lete al his storie passen by;  
<span id="an_1125"></span> Of Custance is my tale specially.  
<span id="an_1126"></span> In the olde Romayn geestes may men fynde  
<span id="an_1127"></span> Maurices lyf; I bere it noght in mynde.  
<span id="an_1128"></span> This kyng Alla, whan he his tyme say,  
<span id="an_1129"></span> With his Custance, his hooly wyf so sweete,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1130">1130</span></span> To Engelond
been they come the righte way,  
<span id="an_1131"></span> Wher as they lyve in joye and in quiete.  
<span id="an_1132"></span> But litel while it lasteth, I yow heete,  
<span id="an_1133"></span> Joye of this world, for tyme wol nat abyde;  
<span id="an_1134"></span> Fro day to nyght it changeth as the tyde.  
<span id="an_1135"></span> Who lyved euere in swich delit o day  
<span id="an_1136"></span> That hym ne moeved outher conscience,  
<span id="an_1137"></span> Or ire, or talent, or som kynnes affray,  
<span id="an_1138"></span> Envye, or pride, or passion, or offence?  
<span id="an_1139"></span> I ne seye but for this ende this sentence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140">1140</span></span> That litel
while in joye or in plesance  
<span id="an_1141"></span> Lasteth the blisse of Alla with Custance.  
<span id="an_1142"></span> For Deeth, that taketh of heigh and logh his
rente,  
<span id="an_1143"></span> Whan passed was a yeer, evene as I gesse,  
<span id="an_1144"></span> Out of this world this kyng Alla he hente,  
<span id="an_1145"></span> For whom Custance hath ful greet hevynesse.  
<span id="an_1146"></span> Now lat us prayen God his soule blesse!  
<span id="an_1147"></span> And dame Custance, finally to seye,  
<span id="an_1148"></span> Toward the toun of Rome goth hir weye.  
<span id="an_1149"></span> To Rome is come this hooly creature,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1150">1150</span></span> And fyndeth
hire freendes hoole and sounde;  
<span id="an_1151"></span> Now is she scaped al hire aventure.  
<span id="an_1152"></span> And whan that she hir fader hath yfounde,  
<span id="an_1153"></span> Doun on hir knees falleth she to grounde;  
<span id="an_1154"></span> Wepynge for tendrenesse in herte blithe,  
<span id="an_1155"></span> She heryeth God an hundred thousand sithe.  
<span id="an_1156"></span> In vertu and in hooly almus-dede  
<span id="an_1157"></span> They lyven alle, and nevere asonder wende;  
<span id="an_1158"></span> Til deeth departeth hem, this lyf they

<span id="an_1159"></span> And fareth now weel! my tale is at an ende.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> Now Jhesu
