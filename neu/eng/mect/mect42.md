#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Canon's Yeoman's Prologue

<span id="an_554"></span> Whan ended was the lyf of Seinte Cecile,  
<span id="an_555"></span> Er we hadde riden fully fyve mile,  
<span id="an_556"></span> At Boghtoun under Blee us gan atake  
<span id="an_557"></span> A man that clothed was in clothes blake,  
<span id="an_558"></span> And undernethe he hadde a whyt surplys.  
<span id="an_559"></span> His hakeney, that was al pomely grys,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> So swatte
that it wonder was to see;  
<span id="an_561"></span> It semed as he had priked miles three.  
<span id="an_562"></span> The hors eek that his yeman rood upon  
<span id="an_563"></span> So swatte that unnethe myghte it gon.  
<span id="an_564"></span> Aboute the peytrel stood the foom ful hye;  
<span id="an_565"></span> He was of foom al flekked as a pye.  
<span id="an_566"></span> A male tweyfoold on his croper lay;  
<span id="an_567"></span> It semed that he caried lite array.  
<span id="an_568"></span> Al light for somer rood this worthy man,  
<span id="an_569"></span> And in myn herte wondren I bigan  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> What that he
was til that I understood  
<span id="an_571"></span> How that his cloke was sowed to his hood,  
<span id="an_572"></span> For which, whan I hadde longe avysed me,  
<span id="an_573"></span> I demed hym som chanoun for to be.  
<span id="an_574"></span> His hat heeng at his bak doun by a laas,  
<span id="an_575"></span> For he hadde riden moore than trot or paas;  
<span id="an_576"></span> He hadde ay priked lik as he were wood.  
<span id="an_577"></span> A clote-leef he hadde under his hood  
<span id="an_578"></span> For swoot and for to keep his heed from
heete.  
<span id="an_579"></span> But it was joye for to seen hym swete!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> His forheed
dropped as a stillatorie  
<span id="an_581"></span> Were ful of plantayne and of paritorie.  
<span id="an_582"></span> And whan that he was come, he gan to crye,  
<span id="an_583"></span> "God save," quod he, "this joly compaignye!  
<span id="an_584"></span> Faste have I priked," quod he, "for youre
sake,  
<span id="an_585"></span> By cause that I wolde yow atake,  
<span id="an_586"></span> To riden in this myrie compaignye."  
<span id="an_587"></span> His yeman eek was ful of curteisye,  
<span id="an_588"></span> And seyde, "Sires, now in the morwe-tyde  
<span id="an_589"></span> Out of youre hostelrie I saugh yow ryde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> And warned
heer my lord and my soverayn,  
<span id="an_591"></span> Which that to ryden with yow is ful fayn  
<span id="an_592"></span> For his desport; he loveth daliaunce."  
<span id="an_593"></span> "Freend, for thy warnyng God yeve thee good
chaunce,"  
<span id="an_594"></span> Thanne seyde oure Hoost, "for certein it wolde
seme  
<span id="an_595"></span> Thy lord were wys, and so I may wel deme.  
<span id="an_596"></span> He is ful jocunde also, dar I leye!  
<span id="an_597"></span> Can he oght telle a myrie tale or tweye,  
<span id="an_598"></span> With which he glade may this compaignye?"  
<span id="an_599"></span> "Who, sire? My lord? Ye, ye, withouten lye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> He kan of
murthe and eek of jolitee  
<span id="an_601"></span> Nat but ynough; also, sire, trusteth me,  
<span id="an_602"></span> And ye hym knewe as wel as do I,  
<span id="an_603"></span> Ye wolde wondre how wel and craftily  
<span id="an_604"></span> He koude werke, and that in sondry wise.  
<span id="an_605"></span> He hath take on hym many a greet emprise,  
<span id="an_606"></span> Which were ful hard for any that is heere  
<span id="an_607"></span> To brynge aboute, but they of hym it leere.  
<span id="an_608"></span> As hoomly as he rit amonges yow,  
<span id="an_609"></span> If ye hym knewe, it wolde be for youre prow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> Ye wolde nat
forgoon his aqueyntaunce  
<span id="an_611"></span> For muchel good, I dar leye in balaunce  
<span id="an_612"></span> Al that I have in my possessioun.  
<span id="an_613"></span> He is a man of heigh discrecioun;  
<span id="an_614"></span> I warne yow wel, he is a passyng man."  
<span id="an_615"></span> "Wel," quod oure Hoost, "I pray thee, tel me
than,  
<span id="an_616"></span> Is he a clerk, or noon? Telle what he is."  
<span id="an_617"></span> "Nay, he is gretter than a clerk, ywis,"  
<span id="an_618"></span> Seyde this Yeman, "and in wordes fewe,  
<span id="an_619"></span> Hoost, of his craft somwhat I wol yow shewe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> "I seye, my
lord kan swich subtilitee --  
<span id="an_621"></span> But al his craft ye may nat wite at me,  
<span id="an_622"></span> And somwhat helpe I yet to his wirkyng --  
<span id="an_623"></span> That al this ground on which we been ridyng,  
<span id="an_624"></span> Til that we come to Caunterbury toun,  
<span id="an_625"></span> He koude al clene turnen up-so-doun,  
<span id="an_626"></span> And pave it al of silver and of gold."  
<span id="an_627"></span> And whan this Yeman hadde this tale ytold  
<span id="an_628"></span> Unto oure Hoost, he seyde, "Benedicitee!  
<span id="an_629"></span> This thyng is wonder merveillous to me,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> Syn that thy
lord is of so heigh prudence,  
<span id="an_631"></span> By cause of which men sholde hym reverence,  
<span id="an_632"></span> That of his worshipe rekketh he so lite.  
<span id="an_633"></span> His overslope nys nat worth a myte,  
<span id="an_634"></span> As in effect, to hym, so moot I go,  
<span id="an_635"></span> It is al baudy and totore also.  
<span id="an_636"></span> Why is thy lord so sluttissh, I the preye,  
<span id="an_637"></span> And is of power bettre clooth to beye,  
<span id="an_638"></span> If that his dede accorde with thy speche?  
<span id="an_639"></span> Telle me that, and that I thee biseche."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> "Why?" quod
this Yeman, "wherto axe ye me?  
<span id="an_641"></span> God help me so, for he shal nevere thee!  
<span id="an_642"></span> (But I wol nat avowe that I seye,  
<span id="an_643"></span> And therfore keepe it secree, I yow preye.)  
<span id="an_644"></span> He is to wys, in feith, as I bileeve.  
<span id="an_645"></span> That that is overdoon, it wol nat preeve  
<span id="an_646"></span> Aright, as clerkes seyn; it is a vice.  
<span id="an_647"></span> Wherfore in that I holde hym lewed and nyce.  
<span id="an_648"></span> For whan a man hath over-greet a wit,  
<span id="an_649"></span> Ful oft hym happeth to mysusen it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> So dooth my
lord, and that me greveth soore;  
<span id="an_651"></span> God it amende! I kan sey yow namoore."  
<span id="an_652"></span> "Ther-of no fors, good Yeman," quod oure
Hoost;  
<span id="an_653"></span> "Syn of the konnyng of thy lord thow woost,  
<span id="an_654"></span> Telle how he dooth, I pray thee hertely,  
<span id="an_655"></span> Syn that he is so crafty and so sly.  
<span id="an_656"></span> Where dwelle ye, if it to telle be?"  
<span id="an_657"></span> "In the suburbes of a toun," quod he,  
<span id="an_658"></span> "Lurkynge in hernes and in lanes blynde,  
<span id="an_659"></span> Whereas thise robbours and thise theves by
kynde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> Holden hir
pryvee fereful residence,  
<span id="an_661"></span> As they that dar nat shewen hir presence;  
<span id="an_662"></span> So faren we, if I shal seye the sothe."  
<span id="an_663"></span> "Now," quod oure Hoost, "yit lat me talke to
the.  
<span id="an_664"></span> Why artow so discoloured of thy face?"  
<span id="an_665"></span> "Peter!" quod he, "God yeve it harde grace,  
<span id="an_666"></span> I am so used in the fyr to blowe  
<span id="an_667"></span> That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe.  
<span id="an_668"></span> I am nat wont in no mirour to prie,  
<span id="an_669"></span> But swynke soore and lerne multiplie.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> We blondren
evere and pouren in the fir,  
<span id="an_671"></span> And for al that we faille of oure desir,  
<span id="an_672"></span> For evere we lakken oure conclusioun.  
<span id="an_673"></span> To muchel folk we doon illusioun,  
<span id="an_674"></span> And borwe gold, be it a pound or two,  
<span id="an_675"></span> Or ten, or twelve, or manye sommes mo,  
<span id="an_676"></span> And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye,  
<span id="an_677"></span> That of a pound we koude make tweye.  
<span id="an_678"></span> Yet is it fals, but ay we han good hope  
<span id="an_679"></span> It for to doon, and after it we grope.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> But that
science is so fer us biforn,  
<span id="an_681"></span> We mowen nat, although we hadden it sworn,  
<span id="an_682"></span> It overtake, it slit awey so faste.  
<span id="an_683"></span> It wole us maken beggers atte laste."  
<span id="an_684"></span> Whil this Yeman was thus in his talkyng,  
<span id="an_685"></span> This Chanoun drough hym neer and herde al
thyng  
<span id="an_686"></span> Which this Yeman spak, for suspecioun  
<span id="an_687"></span> Of mennes speche evere hadde this Chanoun.  
<span id="an_688"></span> For Catoun seith that he that gilty is  
<span id="an_689"></span> Demeth alle thyng be spoke of hym, ywis.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> That was the
cause he gan so ny hym drawe  
<span id="an_691"></span> To his Yeman, to herknen al his sawe.  
<span id="an_692"></span> And thus he seyde unto his Yeman tho:  
<span id="an_693"></span> "Hoold thou thy pees and spek no wordes mo,  
<span id="an_694"></span> For if thou do, thou shalt it deere abye.  
<span id="an_695"></span> Thou sclaundrest me heere in this
compaignye,  
<span id="an_696"></span> And eek discoverest that thou sholdest
hyde."  
<span id="an_697"></span> "Ye," quod oure Hoost, "telle on, what so
bityde.  
<span id="an_698"></span> Of al his thretyng rekke nat a myte!"  
<span id="an_699"></span> "In feith," quod he, "namoore I do but
lyte."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> And whan this
Chanon saugh it wolde nat bee,  
<span id="an_701"></span> But his Yeman wolde telle his pryvetee,  
<span id="an_702"></span> He fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame.  
<span id="an_703"></span> "A!" quod the Yeman, "heere shal arise game;  
<span id="an_704"></span> Al that I kan anon now wol I telle.  
<span id="an_705"></span> Syn he is goon, the foule feend hym quelle!  
<span id="an_706"></span> For nevere heerafter wol I with hym meete  
<span id="an_707"></span> For peny ne for pound, I yow biheete.  
<span id="an_708"></span> He that me broghte first unto that game,  
<span id="an_709"></span> Er that he dye, sorwe have he and shame!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> For it is
ernest to me, by my feith;  
<span id="an_711"></span> That feele I wel, what so any man seith.  
<span id="an_712"></span> And yet, for al my smert and al my grief,  
<span id="an_713"></span> For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief,  
<span id="an_714"></span> I koude nevere leve it in no wise.  
<span id="an_715"></span> Now wolde God my wit myghte suffise  
<span id="an_716"></span> To tellen al that longeth to that art!  
<span id="an_717"></span> But nathelees yow wol I tellen part.  
<span id="an_718"></span> Syn that my lord is goon, I wol nat spare;  
<span id="an_719"></span> Swich thyng as that I knowe, I wol declare.
