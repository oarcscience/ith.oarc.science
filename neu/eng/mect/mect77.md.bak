#### The Shorter Poems

### Gentilesse

<span id="an_1"></span> The firste stok, fader of gentilesse --  
<span id="an_2"></span> What man that desireth gentil for to be  
<span id="an_3"></span> Must folowe his trace, and alle his wittes
dresse  
<span id="an_4"></span> Vertu to love and vyces for to flee.  
<span id="an_5"></span> For unto vertu longeth dignitee  
<span id="an_6"></span> And noght the revers, saufly dar I deme,  
<span id="an_7"></span> Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe.  
<span id="an_8"></span> This firste stok was ful of rightwisnesse,  
<span id="an_9"></span> Trewe of his word, sobre, pitous, and free,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Clene of his
gost, and loved besinesse,  
<span id="an_11"></span> Ayeinst the vyce of slouthe, in honestee;  
<span id="an_12"></span> And, but his heir love vertu as dide he,  
<span id="an_13"></span> He is noght gentil, thogh he riche seme,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Vyce may wel be heir to old richesse,  
<span id="an_16"></span> But ther may no man, as men may wel see,  
<span id="an_17"></span> Bequethe his heir his vertuous noblesse  
<span id="an_18"></span> (That is appropred unto no degree  
<span id="an_19"></span> But to the firste fader in magestee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> That maketh hem
his heyres that him queme),  
<span id="an_21"></span> Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe.
