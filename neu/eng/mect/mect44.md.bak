<span id="an_1"></span> Woot ye nat where ther stant a litel toun  
<span id="an_2"></span> Which that ycleped is Bobbe-up-and-doun,  
<span id="an_3"></span> Under the Blee, in Caunterbury Weye?  
<span id="an_4"></span> Ther gan oure Hooste for to jape and pleye,  
<span id="an_5"></span> And seyde, "Sires, what! Dun is in the myre!  
<span id="an_6"></span> Is ther no man, for preyere ne for hyre,  
<span id="an_7"></span> That wole awake oure felawe al bihynde?  
<span id="an_8"></span> A theef myghte hym ful lightly robbe and
bynde.  
<span id="an_9"></span> See how he nappeth! See how, for cokkes bones,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> That he wol
falle fro his hors atones!  
<span id="an_11"></span> Is that a cook of Londoun, with meschaunce?  
<span id="an_12"></span> Do hym come forth, he knoweth his penaunce;  
<span id="an_13"></span> For he shal telle a tale, by my fey,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Although it be nat worth a botel hey.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Awake, thou Cook," quod he, "God yeve thee
sorwe!  
<span id="an_16"></span> What eyleth thee to slepe by the morwe?  
<span id="an_17"></span> Hastow had fleen al nyght, or artow dronke?  
<span id="an_18"></span> Or hastow with som quene al nyght yswonke,  
<span id="an_19"></span> So that thow mayst nat holden up thyn heed?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> This Cook, that
was ful pale and no thyng reed,  
<span id="an_21"></span> Seyde to oure Hoost, "So God my soule blesse,  
<span id="an_22"></span> As ther is falle on me swich hevynesse,  
<span id="an_23"></span> Noot I nat why, that me were levere slepe  
<span id="an_24"></span> Than the beste galon wyn in Chepe."  
<span id="an_25"></span> "Wel," quod the Maunciple, "if it may doon
ese  
<span id="an_26"></span> To thee, sire Cook, and to no wight displese,  
<span id="an_27"></span> Which that heere rideth in this compaignye,  
<span id="an_28"></span> And that oure Hoost wole, of his curteisye,  
<span id="an_29"></span> I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> For, in good
feith, thy visage is ful pale,  
<span id="an_31"></span> Thyne eyen daswen eek, as that me thynketh,  
<span id="an_32"></span> And, wel I woot, thy breeth ful soure
stynketh:  
<span id="an_33"></span> That sheweth wel thou art nat wel disposed.  
<span id="an_34"></span> Of me, certeyn, thou shalt nat been yglosed.  
<span id="an_35"></span> See how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight,  
<span id="an_36"></span> As though he wolde swolwe us anonright.  
<span id="an_37"></span> Hoold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kyn!  
<span id="an_38"></span> The devel of helle sette his foot therin!  
<span id="an_39"></span> Thy cursed breeth infecte wole us alle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> Fy, stynkyng
swyn! Fy, foule moote thee falle!  
<span id="an_41"></span> A, taketh heede, sires, of this lusty man.  
<span id="an_42"></span> Now, sweete sire, wol ye justen atte fan?  
<span id="an_43"></span> Therto me thynketh ye been wel yshape!  
<span id="an_44"></span> I trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape,  
<span id="an_45"></span> And that is whan men pleyen with a straw."  
<span id="an_46"></span> And with this speche the Cook wax wrooth and
wraw,  
<span id="an_47"></span> And on the Manciple he gan nodde faste  
<span id="an_48"></span> For lakke of speche, and doun the hors hym
caste,  
<span id="an_49"></span> Where as he lay, til that men hym up took.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> This was a fair
chyvachee of a cook!  
<span id="an_51"></span> Allas, he nadde holde hym by his ladel!  
<span id="an_52"></span> And er that he agayn were in his sadel,  
<span id="an_53"></span> Ther was greet showvyng bothe to and fro  
<span id="an_54"></span> To lifte hym up, and muchel care and wo,  
<span id="an_55"></span> So unweeldy was this sory palled goost.  
<span id="an_56"></span> And to the Manciple thanne spak oure Hoost:  
<span id="an_57"></span> "By cause drynke hath dominacioun  
<span id="an_58"></span> Upon this man, by my savacioun,  
<span id="an_59"></span> I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> For, were it
wyn or oold or moysty ale  
<span id="an_61"></span> That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,  
<span id="an_62"></span> And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.  
<span id="an_63"></span> "He hath also to do moore than ynough  
<span id="an_64"></span> To kepen hym and his capul out of the slough;  
<span id="an_65"></span> And if he falle from his capul eftsoone,  
<span id="an_66"></span> Thanne shal we alle have ynogh to doone  
<span id="an_67"></span> In liftyng up his hevy dronken cors.  
<span id="an_68"></span> Telle on thy tale; of hym make I no fors.  
<span id="an_69"></span> "But yet, Manciple, in feith thou art to
nyce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Thus openly
repreve hym of his vice.  
<span id="an_71"></span> Another day he wole, peraventure,  
<span id="an_72"></span> Reclayme thee and brynge thee to lure;  
<span id="an_73"></span> I meene, he speke wole of smale thynges,  
<span id="an_74"></span> As for to pynchen at thy rekenynges,  
<span id="an_75"></span> That were nat honest, if it cam to preef."  
<span id="an_76"></span> "No," quod the Manciple, "that were a greet
mescheef!  
<span id="an_77"></span> So myghte he lightly brynge me in the snare.  
<span id="an_78"></span> Yet hadde I levere payen for the mare  
<span id="an_79"></span> Which he rit on, than he sholde with me
stryve.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> I wol nat
wratthen hym, also moot I thryve!  
<span id="an_81"></span> That that I spak, I seyde it in my bourde.  
<span id="an_82"></span> And wite ye what? I have heer in a gourde  
<span id="an_83"></span> A draghte of wyn, ye, of a ripe grape,  
<span id="an_84"></span> And right anon ye shul seen a good jape.  
<span id="an_85"></span> This Cook shal drynke therof, if I may.  
<span id="an_86"></span> Up peyne of deeth, he wol nat seye me nay."  
<span id="an_87"></span> And certeynly, to tellen as it was,  
<span id="an_88"></span> Of this vessel the Cook drank faste, allas!  
<span id="an_89"></span> What neded hym? He drank ynough biforn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> And whan he
hadde pouped in this horn,  
<span id="an_91"></span> To the Manciple he took the gourde agayn;  
<span id="an_92"></span> And of that drynke the Cook was wonder fayn,  
<span id="an_93"></span> And thanked hym in swich wise as he koude.  
<span id="an_94"></span> Thanne gan oure Hoost to laughen wonder
loude,  
<span id="an_95"></span> And seyde, "I se wel it is necessarie,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Where that we goon, good drynke with us
carie;  
<span id="an_97"></span> For that wol turne rancour and disese  
<span id="an_98"></span> T' acord and love, and many a wrong apese.  
<span id="an_99"></span> "O Bacus, yblessed be thy name,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> That so kanst
turnen ernest into game!  
<span id="an_101"></span> Worshipe and thank be to thy deitee!  
<span id="an_102"></span> Of that mateere ye gete namoore of me.  
<span id="an_103"></span> Telle on thy tale, Manciple, I thee preye."  
<span id="an_104"></span> "Wel, sire," quod he, "now herkneth what I
seye.
