<span id="an_1"></span> O blisful light of which the bemes clere  
<span id="an_2"></span> Adorneth al the thridde heven faire!  
<span id="an_3"></span> O sonnes lief, O Joves doughter deere,  
<span id="an_4"></span> Plesance of love, O goodly debonaire,  
<span id="an_5"></span> In gentil hertes ay redy to repaire!  
<span id="an_6"></span> O veray cause of heele and of gladnesse,  
<span id="an_7"></span> Iheryed be thy myght and thi goodnesse!  
<span id="an_8"></span> In hevene and helle, in erthe and salte see  
<span id="an_9"></span> Is felt thi myght, if that I wel descerne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> As man, brid,

<span id="an_11"></span> Thee fele in tymes with vapour eterne.  
<span id="an_12"></span> God loveth, and to love wol nought werne,  
<span id="an_13"></span> And in this world no lyves creature  
<span id="an_14"></span> Withouten love is worth, or may endure.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Ye Joves first to thilke effectes glade,  
<span id="an_16"></span> Thorugh which that thynges lyven alle and be,  
<span id="an_17"></span> Comeveden, and amorous him made  
<span id="an_18"></span> On mortal thyng, and as yow list, ay ye  
<span id="an_19"></span> Yeve hym in love ese or adversitee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> And in a
thousand formes down hym sente  
<span id="an_21"></span> For love in erthe, and whom yow liste he
hente.  
<span id="an_22"></span> Ye fierse Mars apaisen of his ire,  
<span id="an_23"></span> And as yow list, ye maken hertes digne;  
<span id="an_24"></span> Algates hem that ye wol sette a-fyre,  
<span id="an_25"></span> They dreden shame, and vices they resygne;  
<span id="an_26"></span> Ye do hem corteys be, fresshe and benigne;  
<span id="an_27"></span> And heighe or lowe, after a wight entendeth,  
<span id="an_28"></span> The joies that he hath, youre myght it
sendeth.  
<span id="an_29"></span> Ye holden regne and hous in unitee;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Ye sothfast
cause of frendship ben also;  
<span id="an_31"></span> Ye knowe al thilke covered qualitee  
<span id="an_32"></span> Of thynges, which that folk on wondren so,  
<span id="an_33"></span> Whan they kan nought construe how it may jo  
<span id="an_34"></span> She loveth hym, or whi he loveth here,  
<span id="an_35"></span> As whi this fissh, and naught that, comth to

<span id="an_36"></span> Ye folk a lawe han set in universe,  
<span id="an_37"></span> And this knowe I by hem that lovers be,  
<span id="an_38"></span> That whoso stryveth with yow hath the werse.  
<span id="an_39"></span> Now, lady bryght, for thi benignite,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> At reverence of
hem that serven the,  
<span id="an_41"></span> Whos clerc I am, so techeth me devyse  
<span id="an_42"></span> Som joye of that is felt in thi servyse.  
<span id="an_43"></span> Ye in my naked herte sentement  
<span id="an_44"></span> Inhielde, and do me shewe of thy swetnesse.  
<span id="an_45"></span> Caliope, thi vois be now present,  
<span id="an_46"></span> For now is nede: sestow nought my destresse,  
<span id="an_47"></span> How I mot telle anonright the gladnesse  
<span id="an_48"></span> Of Troilus, to Venus heryinge?  
<span id="an_49"></span> To which gladnesse, who nede hath, God hym
brynge!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> Lay al this
mene while Troilus,  
<span id="an_51"></span> Recordyng his lesson in this manere:  
<span id="an_52"></span> "Mafay," thoughte he, "thus wol I sey, and
thus;  
<span id="an_53"></span> Thus wol I pleyne unto my lady dere;  
<span id="an_54"></span> That word is good, and this shal be my
cheere;  
<span id="an_55"></span> This nyl I nought foryeten in no wise."  
<span id="an_56"></span> God leve hym werken as he kan devyse!  
<span id="an_57"></span> And, Lord, so that his herte gan to quappe,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Heryng hire come, and shorte for to sike!  
<span id="an_59"></span> And Pandarus, that ledde hire by the lappe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Com ner, and
gan in at the curtyn pike,  
<span id="an_61"></span> And seyde, "God do boot on alle syke!  
<span id="an_62"></span> Se who is here yow comen to visite:  
<span id="an_63"></span> Lo, here is she that is youre deth to wite."  
<span id="an_64"></span> Therwith it semed as he wepte almost.  
<span id="an_65"></span> "Ha, a," quod Troilus so reufully,  
<span id="an_66"></span> "Wher me be wo, O myghty God, thow woost!  
<span id="an_67"></span> Who is al ther? I se nought trewely."  
<span id="an_68"></span> "Sire," quod Criseyde, "it is Pandare and I."  
<span id="an_69"></span> "Ye, swete herte? Allas, I may nought rise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> To knele and do
yow honour in som wyse."  
<span id="an_71"></span> And dressed hym upward, and she right tho  
<span id="an_72"></span> Gan bothe hire hondes softe upon hym leye.  
<span id="an_73"></span> "O, for the love of God, do ye nought so  
<span id="an_74"></span> To me," quod she, "I! What is this to seye?  
<span id="an_75"></span> Sire, comen am I to yow for causes tweye:  
<span id="an_76"></span> First, yow to thonke, and of youre lordshipe
eke  
<span id="an_77"></span> Continuance I wolde yow biseke."  
<span id="an_78"></span> This Troilus, that herde his lady preye  
<span id="an_79"></span> Of lordshipe hym, wax neither quyk ne ded,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> Ne myghte o
word for shame to it seye,  
<span id="an_81"></span> Although men sholde smyten of his hed.  
<span id="an_82"></span> But Lord, so he wex sodeynliche red,  
<span id="an_83"></span> And sire, his lessoun, that he wende konne  
<span id="an_84"></span> To preyen hire, is thorugh his wit ironne.  
<span id="an_85"></span> Criseyde al this aspied wel ynough,  
<span id="an_86"></span> For she was wis, and loved hym nevere the
lasse,  
<span id="an_87"></span> Al nere he malapert, or made it tough,  
<span id="an_88"></span> Or was to bold, to synge a fool a masse.  
<span id="an_89"></span> But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> His resons, as
I may my rymes holde,  
<span id="an_91"></span> I yow wol telle, as techen bokes olde.  
<span id="an_92"></span> In chaunged vois, right for his verray drede,  
<span id="an_93"></span> Which vois ek quook, and therto his manere  
<span id="an_94"></span> Goodly abaist, and now his hewes rede,  
<span id="an_95"></span> Now pale, unto Criseyde, his lady dere,  
<span id="an_96"></span> With look down cast and humble iyolden chere,  
<span id="an_97"></span> Lo, the alderfirste word that hym asterte  
<span id="an_98"></span> Was, twyes, "Mercy, mercy, swete herte!"  
<span id="an_99"></span> And stynte a while, and whan he myghte out
brynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> The nexte
word was, "God woot, for I have,  
<span id="an_101"></span> As ferforthly as I have had konnynge,  
<span id="an_102"></span> Ben youres al, God so my soule save,  
<span id="an_103"></span> And shal til that I, woful wight, be grave!  
<span id="an_104"></span> And though I dar, ne kan, unto yow pleyne,  
<span id="an_105"></span> Iwis, I suffre nought the lasse peyne.  
<span id="an_106"></span> "Thus muche as now, O wommanliche wif,  
<span id="an_107"></span> I may out brynge, and if this yow displese,  
<span id="an_108"></span> That shal I wreke upon myn owen lif  
<span id="an_109"></span> Right soone, I trowe, and do youre herte an

<span id="an_111"></span> But syn that ye han herd me somwhat seye,  
<span id="an_112"></span> Now recche I nevere how soone that I deye."  
<span id="an_113"></span> Therwith his manly sorwe to biholde  
<span id="an_114"></span> It myghte han mad an herte of stoon to rewe;  
<span id="an_115"></span> And Pandare wep as he to water wolde,  
<span id="an_116"></span> And poked evere his nece new and newe,  
<span id="an_117"></span> And seyde, "Wo bygon ben hertes trewe!  
<span id="an_118"></span> For love of God, make of this thing an ende,  
<span id="an_119"></span> Or sle us both at ones er ye wende."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> "I, what?"
quod she, "by God and by my trouthe,

<span id="an_424"></span> Ech to his owen nedes gan entende.  
<span id="an_425"></span> But Troilus, though as the fir he brende  
<span id="an_426"></span> For sharp desir of hope and of plesaunce,  
<span id="an_427"></span> He nought forgat his goode governaunce,

<span id="an_431"></span> Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,

<span id="an_433"></span> From every wight as fer as is the cloude  
<span id="an_434"></span> He was, so wel dissimilen he koude.  
<span id="an_435"></span> And al the while which that I yow devyse,  
<span id="an_436"></span> This was his lif: with all his fulle myght,  
<span id="an_437"></span> By day, he was in Martes heigh servyse --  
<span id="an_438"></span> This is to seyn, in armes as a knyght;  
<span id="an_439"></span> And for the more part, the longe nyght  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> He lay and
thoughte how that he myghte serve  
<span id="an_441"></span> His lady best, hire thonk for to deserve.  
<span id="an_442"></span> Nil I naught swere, although he lay ful
softe,  
<span id="an_443"></span> That in his thought he nas somwhat disesed,  
<span id="an_444"></span> Ne that he torned on his pilwes ofte,  
<span id="an_445"></span> And wold of that hym missed han ben sesed.  
<span id="an_446"></span> But in swich cas men is nought alwey plesed,  
<span id="an_447"></span> For aught I woot, namore than was he;  
<span id="an_448"></span> That kan I deme of possibilitee.  
<span id="an_449"></span> But certeyn is, to purpos for to go,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> That in this
while, as writen is in geeste,  
<span id="an_451"></span> He say his lady somtyme, and also  
<span id="an_452"></span> She with hym spak, whan that she dorst or
leste;  
<span id="an_453"></span> And by hire bothe avys, as was the beste,  
<span id="an_454"></span> Apoynteden full warly in this nede,  
<span id="an_455"></span> So as they durste, how they wolde procede.  
<span id="an_456"></span> But it was spoken in so short a wise,  
<span id="an_457"></span> In swich await alwey, and in swich feere,  
<span id="an_458"></span> Lest any wight devynen or devyse  
<span id="an_459"></span> Wolde of hem two, or to it laye an ere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> That al this
world so leef to hem ne were  
<span id="an_461"></span> As that Cupide wolde hem grace sende  
<span id="an_462"></span> To maken of hire speche aright an ende.  
<span id="an_463"></span> But thilke litel that they spake or
wroughte,  
<span id="an_464"></span> His wise goost took ay of al swych heede,  
<span id="an_465"></span> It semed hire he wiste what she thoughte  
<span id="an_466"></span> Withouten word, so that it was no nede  
<span id="an_467"></span> To bidde hym ought to doon, or ought
forbeede;  
<span id="an_468"></span> For which she thought that love, al come it
late,  
<span id="an_469"></span> Of alle joie hadde opned hire the yate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> And shortly
of this proces for to pace,  
<span id="an_471"></span> So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,  
<span id="an_472"></span> That he so ful stood in his lady grace,  
<span id="an_473"></span> That twenty thousand tymes, er she lette,  
<span id="an_474"></span> She thonked God that evere she with hym
mette.  
<span id="an_475"></span> So koude he hym governe in swich servyse,  
<span id="an_476"></span> That al the world ne myght it bet devyse.  
<span id="an_477"></span> For whi she fond hym so discret in al,  
<span id="an_478"></span> So secret, and of swich obeisaunce,  
<span id="an_479"></span> That wel she felte he was to hire a wal  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> Of stiel, and
sheld from every displesaunce;  
<span id="an_481"></span> That to ben in his goode governaunce,  
<span id="an_482"></span> So wis he was, she was namore afered --  
<span id="an_483"></span> I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered.  
<span id="an_484"></span> And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fir,  
<span id="an_485"></span> Was evere ylike prest and diligent;  
<span id="an_486"></span> To ese his frend was set al his desir.  
<span id="an_487"></span> He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;  
<span id="an_488"></span> He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent;  
<span id="an_489"></span> That nevere man, as in his frendes nede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> Ne bar hym
bet than he, withouten drede.  
<span id="an_491"></span> But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde  
<span id="an_492"></span> That every word, or soonde, or look, or

<span id="an_493"></span> Of Troilus that I rehercen sholde,  
<span id="an_494"></span> In al this while unto his lady deere --  
<span id="an_495"></span> I trowe it were a long thyng for to here --  
<span id="an_496"></span> Or of what wight that stant in swich

<span id="an_498"></span> For sothe, I have naught herd it don er this

<span id="an_503"></span> Neigh half this book, of which hym liste
nought write.  
<span id="an_504"></span> How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endite?  
<span id="an_505"></span> But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,  
<span id="an_506"></span> That stondyng in concord and in quiete,  
<span id="an_507"></span> Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,  
<span id="an_508"></span> As I have told, and in this tyme swete --  
<span id="an_509"></span> Save only often myghte they nought mete,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> Ne leiser

<span id="an_511"></span> That it bifel right as I shal yow telle:  
<span id="an_512"></span> That Pandarus, that evere dide his myght  
<span id="an_513"></span> Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here,  
<span id="an_514"></span> As for to bryngen to his hows som nyght  
<span id="an_515"></span> His faire nece and Troilus yfere,

<span id="an_519"></span> For he with gret deliberacioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> Hadde every

<span id="an_521"></span> Forncast and put in execucioun,  
<span id="an_522"></span> And neither left for cost ne for travaille.  
<span id="an_523"></span> Come if hem list, hem sholde no thyng

<span id="an_531"></span> Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde  
<span id="an_532"></span> A certeyn houre, in which she comen sholde.  
<span id="an_533"></span> And Troilus, that al this purveiaunce  
<span id="an_534"></span> Knew at the fulle, and waited on it ay,  
<span id="an_535"></span> Hadde hereupon ek mad gret ordinaunce,  
<span id="an_536"></span> And found his cause, and therto his aray,  
<span id="an_537"></span> If that he were missed, nyght or day,  
<span id="an_538"></span> Ther-while he was aboute this servyse,  
<span id="an_539"></span> That he was gon to don his sacrifise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> And moste at
swich a temple allone wake,  
<span id="an_541"></span> Answered of Apollo for to be;  
<span id="an_542"></span> And first to sen the holy laurer quake,  
<span id="an_543"></span> Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,  
<span id="an_544"></span> To telle hym next whan Grekes sholde flee --  
<span id="an_545"></span> And forthy lette hym no man, God forbede,  
<span id="an_546"></span> But prey Apollo helpen in this nede.  
<span id="an_547"></span> Now is ther litel more for to doone,  
<span id="an_548"></span> But Pandare up and, shortly for to seyne,  
<span id="an_549"></span> Right sone upon the chaungynge of the moone,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> Whan lightles
is the world a nyght or tweyne,  
<span id="an_551"></span> And that the wolken shop hym for to reyne,  
<span id="an_552"></span> He streght o morwe unto his nece wente --  
<span id="an_553"></span> Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente.  
<span id="an_554"></span> Whan he was com, he gan anon to pleye  
<span id="an_555"></span> As he was wont, and of hymself to jape;  
<span id="an_556"></span> And finaly he swor and gan hire seye,  
<span id="an_557"></span> By this and that, she sholde hym nought
escape,  
<span id="an_558"></span> Ne lenger don hym after hire to cape;  
<span id="an_559"></span> But certeynly she moste, by hire leve,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> Come soupen
in his hous with hym at eve.  
<span id="an_561"></span> At which she lough, and gan hire faste
excuse,  
<span id="an_562"></span> And seyde, "It reyneth. lo, how sholde I
gon?"  
<span id="an_563"></span> "Lat be," quod he, "ne stant nought thus to
muse.  
<span id="an_564"></span> This moot be don! Ye shal be ther anon."  
<span id="an_565"></span> So at the laste herof they fille aton,  
<span id="an_566"></span> Or elles, softe he swor hire in hire ere,  
<span id="an_567"></span> He nolde nevere comen ther she were.  
<span id="an_568"></span> Soone after this, she to hym gan to rowne,  
<span id="an_569"></span> And axed hym if Troilus were there.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> He swor hire
nay, for he was out of towne,  
<span id="an_571"></span> And seyde, "Nece, I pose that he were;  
<span id="an_572"></span> Yow thurste nevere han the more fere;  
<span id="an_573"></span> For rather than men myghte hym ther aspie,  
<span id="an_574"></span> Me were levere a thousand fold to dye."  
<span id="an_575"></span> Nought list myn auctour fully to declare  
<span id="an_576"></span> What that she thoughte whan he seyde so,  
<span id="an_577"></span> That Troilus was out of towne yfare,  
<span id="an_578"></span> As if he seyde therof soth or no;  
<span id="an_579"></span> But that, withowten await, with hym to go,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> She graunted
hym, sith he hire that bisoughte,  
<span id="an_581"></span> And, as his nece, obeyed as hire oughte.  
<span id="an_582"></span> But natheles, yet gan she hym biseche,  
<span id="an_583"></span> Although with hym to gon it was no fere,  
<span id="an_584"></span> For to ben war of goosissh poeples speche,  
<span id="an_585"></span> That dremen thynges whiche as nevere were,  
<span id="an_586"></span> And wel avyse hym whom he broughte there;  
<span id="an_587"></span> And seyde hym, "Em, syn I moste on yow
triste,  
<span id="an_588"></span> Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste."  
<span id="an_589"></span> He swor hire yis, by stokkes and by stones,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> And by the
goddes that in hevene dwelle,  
<span id="an_591"></span> Or elles were hym levere, soule and bones,  
<span id="an_592"></span> With Pluto kyng as depe ben in helle  
<span id="an_593"></span> As Tantalus -- what sholde I more telle?  
<span id="an_594"></span> Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,  
<span id="an_595"></span> And she to soper com, whan it was eve,  
<span id="an_596"></span> With a certein of hire owen men,  
<span id="an_597"></span> And with hire faire nece Antigone,  
<span id="an_598"></span> And other of hire wommen nyne or ten.  
<span id="an_599"></span> But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> But Troilus,
that stood and myght it se  
<span id="an_601"></span> Thorughout a litel wyndow in a stewe,  
<span id="an_602"></span> Ther he bishet syn mydnyght was in mewe,  
<span id="an_603"></span> Unwist of every wight but of Pandare?  
<span id="an_604"></span> But to the point: now whan that she was
come,  
<span id="an_605"></span> With alle joie and alle frendes fare  
<span id="an_606"></span> Hire em anon in armes hath hire nome,  
<span id="an_607"></span> And after to the soper, alle and some,  
<span id="an_608"></span> Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette.  
<span id="an_609"></span> God woot, ther was no deynte for to fette!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> And after
soper gonnen they to rise,  
<span id="an_611"></span> At ese wel, with herte fresshe and glade;  
<span id="an_612"></span> And wel was hym that koude best devyse  
<span id="an_613"></span> To liken hire, or that hire laughen made:  
<span id="an_614"></span> He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade.  
<span id="an_615"></span> But at the laste, as every thyng hath ende,  
<span id="an_616"></span> She took hire leve, and nedes wolde wende.  
<span id="an_617"></span> But O Fortune, executrice of wierdes,  
<span id="an_618"></span> O influences of thise hevenes hye!  
<span id="an_619"></span> Soth is, that under God ye ben oure hierdes,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> Though to us
bestes ben the causez wrie.  
<span id="an_621"></span> This mene I now: for she gan homward hye,  
<span id="an_622"></span> But execut was al bisyde hire leve  
<span id="an_623"></span> The goddes wil, for which she moste bleve.  
<span id="an_624"></span> The bente moone with hire hornes pale,  
<span id="an_625"></span> Saturne, and Jove, in Cancro joyned were,  
<span id="an_626"></span> That swych a reyn from heven gan avale  
<span id="an_627"></span> That every maner womman that was there  
<span id="an_628"></span> Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray feere;  
<span id="an_629"></span> At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde
thenne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> "Now were it
tyme a lady to gon henne!  
<span id="an_631"></span> "But goode nece, if I myghte evere plese  
<span id="an_632"></span> Yow any thyng, than prey ich yow," quod he,  
<span id="an_633"></span> "To don myn herte as now so gret an ese  
<span id="an_634"></span> As for to dwelle here al this nyght with me,  
<span id="an_635"></span> For-whi this is youre owen hous, parde.  
<span id="an_636"></span> For by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game,  
<span id="an_637"></span> To wende as now, it were to me a shame."  
<span id="an_638"></span> Criseyde, which that koude as muche good  
<span id="an_639"></span> As half a world, took hede of his preiere;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> And syn it
ron, and al was on a flod,  
<span id="an_641"></span> She thoughte, "As good chep may I dwellen
here,  
<span id="an_642"></span> And graunte it gladly with a frendes chere,  
<span id="an_643"></span> And have a thonk, as grucche and thanne

<span id="an_645"></span> "I wol," quod she, "myn uncle lief and

<span id="an_646"></span> Syn that yow list, it skile is to be so.  
<span id="an_647"></span> I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;  
<span id="an_648"></span> I seyde but a-game I wolde go."  
<span id="an_649"></span> "Iwys, graunt mercy, nece," quod he tho,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> "Were it a

<span id="an_651"></span> Now am I glad, syn that yow list to dwelle."  
<span id="an_652"></span> Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright  
<span id="an_653"></span> The newe joie and al the feste agayn.  
<span id="an_654"></span> But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he myght,  
<span id="an_655"></span> He wolde han hyed hire to bedde fayn,  
<span id="an_656"></span> And seyde, "Lord, this is an huge rayn!

<span id="an_672"></span> So go we slepe: I trowe it be the beste."  
<span id="an_673"></span> Ther nys no more, but hereafter soone,  
<span id="an_674"></span> The voide dronke, and travers drawe anon,  
<span id="an_675"></span> Gan every wight that hadde nought to done  
<span id="an_676"></span> More in the place out of the chaumbre gon.  
<span id="an_677"></span> And evere mo so sterneliche it ron,

<span id="an_687"></span> So whan that she was in the closet leyd,

adown right he hym sette,  
<span id="an_701"></span> And shortly to the point right for to gon,  
<span id="an_702"></span> Of al this werk he tolde hym word and ende,  
<span id="an_703"></span> And seyde, "Make the redy right anon,

<span id="an_743"></span> The sterne wynd so loude gan to route

<span id="an_1054"></span> To Troilus was nevere yet Criseyde."  
<span id="an_1055"></span> With that here heed down in the bed she
leyde,  
<span id="an_1056"></span> And with the sheete it wreigh, and sighte
soore,  
<span id="an_1057"></span> And held hire pees; nought o word spak she
more.  
<span id="an_1058"></span> But now help God to quenchen al this sorwe!  
<span id="an_1059"></span> So hope I that he shal, for he best may.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060">1060</span></span> For I have
seyn of a ful misty morwe  
<span id="an_1061"></span> Folowen ful ofte a myrie someris day;  
<span id="an_1062"></span> And after wynter foloweth grene May;  
<span id="an_1063"></span> Men sen alday, and reden ek in stories,  
<span id="an_1064"></span> That after sharpe shoures ben victories.  
<span id="an_1065"></span> This Troilus, whan he hire wordes herde,  
<span id="an_1066"></span> Have ye no care, hym liste nought to slepe;  
<span id="an_1067"></span> For it thoughte hym no strokes of a yerde  
<span id="an_1068"></span> To heere or seen Criseyde, his lady, wepe;  
<span id="an_1069"></span> But wel he felt aboute his herte crepe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070">1070</span></span> For everi
tere which that Criseyde asterte,  
<span id="an_1071"></span> The crampe of deth to streyne hym by the
herte.  
<span id="an_1072"></span> And in his mynde he gan the tyme acorse  
<span id="an_1073"></span> That he com there, and that, that he was
born;  
<span id="an_1074"></span> For now is wikke torned into worse,  
<span id="an_1075"></span> And al that labour he hath don byforn,  
<span id="an_1076"></span> He wende it lost; he thoughte he nas but
lorn.  
<span id="an_1077"></span> "O Pandarus," thoughte he, "allas, thi wile  
<span id="an_1078"></span> Serveth of nought, so weylaway the while!"  
<span id="an_1079"></span> And therwithal he heng adown the heed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> And fil on
knees, and sorwfully he sighte.  
<span id="an_1081"></span> What myghte he seyn? He felte he nas but
deed,  
<span id="an_1082"></span> For wroth was she that sholde his sorwes
lighte.  
<span id="an_1083"></span> But natheles, whan that he speken myghte,  
<span id="an_1084"></span> Than seyde he thus, "God woot that of this
game,  
<span id="an_1085"></span> Whan al is wist, than am I nought to
blame."  
<span id="an_1086"></span> Therwith the sorwe so his herte shette  
<span id="an_1087"></span> That from his eyen fil there nought a tere,  
<span id="an_1088"></span> And every spirit his vigour in knette,  
<span id="an_1089"></span> So they astoned or oppressed were.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090">1090</span></span> The felyng
of his sorwe, or of his fere,  
<span id="an_1091"></span> Or of aught elles, fled was out of towne;  
<span id="an_1092"></span> And down he fel al sodeynly a-swowne.  
<span id="an_1093"></span> This was no litel sorwe for to se;  
<span id="an_1094"></span> But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste;  
<span id="an_1095"></span> "O nece, pes, or we be lost!" quod he,  
<span id="an_1096"></span> "Beth naught agast!" But certeyn, at the
laste,  
<span id="an_1097"></span> For this or that, he into bed hym caste,  
<span id="an_1098"></span> And seyde, "O thef, is this a mannes
herte?"  
<span id="an_1099"></span> And of he rente al to his bare sherte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100">1100</span></span> And seyde,
"Nece, but ye helpe us now,  
<span id="an_1101"></span> Allas, youre owen Troilus is lorn!"  
<span id="an_1102"></span> "Iwis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,  
<span id="an_1103"></span> Ful fayn," quod she. "Allas, that I was
born"!  
<span id="an_1104"></span> "Yee, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn  
<span id="an_1105"></span> That stiketh in his herte?" quod Pandare.  
<span id="an_1106"></span> "Sey \`Al foryeve,' and stynt is al this
fare!"  
<span id="an_1107"></span> "Ye, that to me," quod she, "ful levere
were  
<span id="an_1108"></span> Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth."  
<span id="an_1109"></span> And therwithal she swor hym in his ere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1110">1110</span></span> "Iwys, my
deere herte, I am nought wroth,  
<span id="an_1111"></span> Have here my trouthe!" -- and many an other
oth.  
<span id="an_1112"></span> "Now speke to me, for it am I, Criseyde!"  
<span id="an_1113"></span> But al for nought; yit myght he nought
abreyde.  
<span id="an_1114"></span> Therwith his pous and paumes of his hondes  
<span id="an_1115"></span> They gan to frote, and wete his temples
tweyne;  
<span id="an_1116"></span> And to deliveren hym fro bittre bondes  
<span id="an_1117"></span> She ofte hym kiste; and shortly for to
seyne,  
<span id="an_1118"></span> Hym to revoken she did al hire peyne;  
<span id="an_1119"></span> And at the laste, he gan his breth to
drawe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120">1120</span></span> And of his
swough sone after that adawe,  
<span id="an_1121"></span> And gan bet mynde and reson to hym take,  
<span id="an_1122"></span> But wonder soore he was abayst, iwis;  
<span id="an_1123"></span> And with a sik, whan he gan bet awake,  
<span id="an_1124"></span> He seyde, "O mercy, God, what thyng is
this?"  
<span id="an_1125"></span> "Why do ye with youreselven thus amys?"  
<span id="an_1126"></span> Quod tho Criseyde, "Is this a mannes game?  
<span id="an_1127"></span> What, Troilus, wol ye do thus for shame?"  
<span id="an_1128"></span> And therwithal hire arm over hym she leyde,  
<span id="an_1129"></span> And al foryaf, and ofte tyme hym keste.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1130">1130</span></span> He thonked
hire, and to hire spak, and seyde  
<span id="an_1131"></span> As fil to purpos for his herte reste;  
<span id="an_1132"></span> And she to that answerde hym as hire leste,  
<span id="an_1133"></span> And with hire goodly wordes hym disporte  
<span id="an_1134"></span> She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.  
<span id="an_1135"></span> Quod Pandarus, "For aught I kan aspien,  
<span id="an_1136"></span> This light, nor I, ne serven here of
nought.  
<span id="an_1137"></span> Light is nought good for sike folkes yen!  
<span id="an_1138"></span> But, for the love of God, syn ye ben
brought  
<span id="an_1139"></span> In thus good plit, lat now no hevy thought  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140">1140</span></span> Ben hangyng
in the hertes of yow tweye" --  
<span id="an_1141"></span> And bar the candel to the chymeneye.  
<span id="an_1142"></span> Soone after this, though it no nede were,  
<span id="an_1143"></span> Whan she swiche othes as hire leste devyse  
<span id="an_1144"></span> Hadde of hym take, hire thoughte tho no
fere,  
<span id="an_1145"></span> Ne cause ek non to bidde hym thennes rise.  
<span id="an_1146"></span> Yet lasse thyng than othes may suffise  
<span id="an_1147"></span> In many a cas, for every wyght, I gesse,  
<span id="an_1148"></span> That loveth wel, meneth but gentilesse.  
<span id="an_1149"></span> But in effect she wolde wite anon  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1150">1150</span></span> Of what
man, and ek wheer, and also why  
<span id="an_1151"></span> He jalous was, syn ther was cause non;  
<span id="an_1152"></span> And ek the sygne that he took it by,  
<span id="an_1153"></span> She badde hym that to telle hire bisily,  
<span id="an_1154"></span> Or elles, certeyn, she bar hym on honde  
<span id="an_1155"></span> That this was don of malice, hire to fonde.  
<span id="an_1156"></span> Withouten more, shortly for to seyne,  
<span id="an_1157"></span> He most obeye unto his lady heste;  
<span id="an_1158"></span> And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne.  
<span id="an_1159"></span> He seyde hire, whan she was at swich a

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> She myght
on hym han loked at the leste --  
<span id="an_1161"></span> Noot I nought what, al deere ynough a
rysshe,  
<span id="an_1162"></span> As he that nedes most a cause fisshe.  
<span id="an_1163"></span> And she answerde, "Swete, al were it so,  
<span id="an_1164"></span> What harm was that, syn I non yvel mene?  
<span id="an_1165"></span> For, by that God that bought us bothe two,  
<span id="an_1166"></span> In alle thyng is myn entente cleene.  
<span id="an_1167"></span> Swiche argumentes ne ben naught worth a

<span id="an_1168"></span> Wol ye the childissh jalous contrefete?  
<span id="an_1169"></span> Now were it worthi that ye were ybete."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1170">1170</span></span> Tho Troilus
gan sorwfully to sike --  
<span id="an_1171"></span> Lest she be wroth, hym thoughte his herte
deyde --  
<span id="an_1172"></span> And seyde, "Allas, upon my sorwes sike  
<span id="an_1173"></span> Have mercy, swete herte myn, Criseyde!  
<span id="an_1174"></span> And if that in tho wordes that I seyde  
<span id="an_1175"></span> Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace.  
<span id="an_1176"></span> Doth what yow list; I am al in youre
grace."  
<span id="an_1177"></span> And she answerde, "Of gilt misericorde!  
<span id="an_1178"></span> That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;  
<span id="an_1179"></span> And evere more on this nyght yow recorde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1180">1180</span></span> And beth
wel war ye do namore amys."  
<span id="an_1181"></span> "Nay, dere herte myn," quod he, "iwys!"  
<span id="an_1182"></span> "And now," quod she, "that I have don yow
smerte,  
<span id="an_1183"></span> Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte."  
<span id="an_1184"></span> This Troilus, with blisse of that
supprised,  
<span id="an_1185"></span> Putte al in Goddes hand, as he that mente  
<span id="an_1186"></span> Nothing but wel; and sodeynly avysed,  
<span id="an_1187"></span> He hire in armes faste to hym hente.  
<span id="an_1188"></span> And Pandarus with a ful good entente  
<span id="an_1189"></span> Leyde hym to slepe, and seyde, "If ye be
wise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190">1190</span></span> Swouneth
nought now, lest more folk arise!"  
<span id="an_1191"></span> What myghte or may the sely larke seye,  
<span id="an_1192"></span> Whan that the sperhauk hath it in his foot?  
<span id="an_1193"></span> I kan namore; but of thise ilke tweye --  
<span id="an_1194"></span> To whom this tale sucre be or soot --  
<span id="an_1195"></span> Though that I tarie a yer, somtyme I moot,  
<span id="an_1196"></span> After myn auctour, tellen hire gladnesse,  
<span id="an_1197"></span> As wel as I have told hire hevynesse.  
<span id="an_1198"></span> Criseyde, which that felte hire thus itake,  
<span id="an_1199"></span> As writen clerkes in hire bokes olde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> Right as an
aspes leef she gan to quake,  
<span id="an_1201"></span> Whan she hym felte hire in his armes folde.  
<span id="an_1202"></span> But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,  
<span id="an_1203"></span> Gan thanken tho the bryghte goddes sevene;  
<span id="an_1204"></span> Thus sondry peynes bryngen folk in hevene.  
<span id="an_1205"></span> This Troilus in armes gan hire streyne,  
<span id="an_1206"></span> And seyde, "O swete, as evere mot I gon,  
<span id="an_1207"></span> Now be ye kaught; now is ther but we
tweyne!  
<span id="an_1208"></span> Now yeldeth yow, for other bote is non!"  
<span id="an_1209"></span> To that Criseyde answerde thus anon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> "Ne hadde I
er now, my swete herte deere,  
<span id="an_1211"></span> Ben yolde, ywis, I were now nought heere!"  
<span id="an_1212"></span> O, sooth is seyd, that heled for to be  
<span id="an_1213"></span> As of a fevre or other gret siknesse,  
<span id="an_1214"></span> Men moste drynke, as men may ofte se,  
<span id="an_1215"></span> Ful bittre drynke; and for to han gladnesse  
<span id="an_1216"></span> Men drynken ofte peyne and gret distresse
--  
<span id="an_1217"></span> I mene it here, as for this aventure,  
<span id="an_1218"></span> That thorugh a peyne hath founden al his
cure.  
<span id="an_1219"></span> And now swetnesse semeth more swete,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1220">1220</span></span> That

<span id="an_1221"></span> For out of wo in blisse now they flete;  
<span id="an_1222"></span> Non swich they felten sithen they were
born.  
<span id="an_1223"></span> Now is this bet than bothe two be lorn.  
<span id="an_1224"></span> For love of God, take every womman heede  
<span id="an_1225"></span> To werken thus, if it comth to the neede.  
<span id="an_1226"></span> Criseyde, al quyt from every drede and
tene,  
<span id="an_1227"></span> As she that juste cause hadde hym to

<span id="an_1228"></span> Made hym swych feste it joye was to sene,  
<span id="an_1229"></span> Whan she his trouthe and clene entente
wiste;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1230">1230</span></span> And as

<span id="an_1231"></span> Bytrent and writh the swote wodebynde,  
<span id="an_1232"></span> Gan ech of hem in armes other wynde.  
<span id="an_1233"></span> And as the newe abaysed nyghtyngale,  
<span id="an_1234"></span> That stynteth first whan she bygynneth to

<span id="an_1237"></span> And after siker doth hire vois out rynge,  
<span id="an_1238"></span> Right so Criseyde, whan hire drede stente,  
<span id="an_1239"></span> Opned hire herte and tolde hym hire

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1240">1240</span></span> And right
as he that seth his deth yshapen,  
<span id="an_1241"></span> And dyen mot, in ought that he may gesse,  
<span id="an_1242"></span> And sodeynly rescous doth hym escapen,  
<span id="an_1243"></span> And from his deth is brought in sykernesse,  
<span id="an_1244"></span> For al this world, in swych present
gladnesse  
<span id="an_1245"></span> Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete.  
<span id="an_1246"></span> With worse hap God lat us nevere mete!  
<span id="an_1247"></span> Hire armes smale, hire streghte bak and
softe,  
<span id="an_1248"></span> Hire sydes longe, flesshly, smothe, and

<span id="an_1249"></span> He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1250">1250</span></span> Hire

<span id="an_1251"></span> Thus in this hevene he gan hym to delite,  
<span id="an_1252"></span> And therwithal a thousand tyme hire kiste,  
<span id="an_1253"></span> That what to don, for joie unnethe he
wiste.  
<span id="an_1254"></span> Than seyde he thus: "O Love, O Charite!  
<span id="an_1255"></span> Thi moder ek, Citheria the swete,  
<span id="an_1256"></span> After thiself next heried be she --

<span id="an_1275"></span> And therwithal Criseyde anon he kiste,  
<span id="an_1276"></span> Of which certein she felte no disese,  
<span id="an_1277"></span> And thus seyde he: "Now wolde God I wiste,

<span id="an_1562"></span> And ner he com, and seyde, "How stant it
now  
<span id="an_1563"></span> This mury morwe? Nece, how kan ye fare?"  
<span id="an_1564"></span> Criseyde answerde, "Nevere the bet for yow,

<span id="an_1566"></span> God help me so, ye caused al this fare,

white.  
<span id="an_1568"></span> O, whoso seeth yow knoweth yow ful lite."  
<span id="an_1569"></span> With that she gan hire face for to wrye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1570">1570</span></span> With the
shete, and wax for shame al reed;  
<span id="an_1571"></span> And Pandarus gan under for to prie,  
<span id="an_1572"></span> And seyde, "Nece, if that I shal be ded,  
<span id="an_1573"></span> Have here a swerd and smyteth of myn hed!"  
<span id="an_1574"></span> With that his arm al sodeynly he thriste  
<span id="an_1575"></span> Under hire nekke, and at the laste hire
kyste.  
<span id="an_1576"></span> I passe al that which chargeth nought to

<span id="an_1577"></span> What! God foryaf his deth, and she al so  
<span id="an_1578"></span> Foryaf, and with here uncle gan to pleye,  
<span id="an_1579"></span> For other cause was ther noon than so.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> But of this
thing right to the effect to go:  
<span id="an_1581"></span> Whan tyme was, hom til here hous she wente,  
<span id="an_1582"></span> And Pandarus hath fully his entente.  
<span id="an_1583"></span> Now torne we ayeyn to Troilus,  
<span id="an_1584"></span> That resteles ful longe abedde lay,  
<span id="an_1585"></span> And pryvely sente after Pandarus,  
<span id="an_1586"></span> To hym to com in al the haste he may.  
<span id="an_1587"></span> He com anon -- nought ones seyde he nay --  
<span id="an_1588"></span> And Troilus ful sobrely he grette,  
<span id="an_1589"></span> And down upon his beddes syde hym sette.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1590">1590</span></span> This
Troilus, with al th' affeccioun  
<span id="an_1591"></span> Of frendes love that herte may devyse,  
<span id="an_1592"></span> To Pandarus on knowes fil adown,  
<span id="an_1593"></span> And er that he wolde of the place arise  
<span id="an_1594"></span> He gan hym thonken in his beste wise  
<span id="an_1595"></span> An hondred sythe, and gan the tyme blesse  
<span id="an_1596"></span> That he was born, to brynge hym fro
destresse.  
<span id="an_1597"></span> He seyde, "O frend of frendes the
alderbeste  
<span id="an_1598"></span> That evere was, the sothe for to telle,  
<span id="an_1599"></span> Thow hast in hevene ybrought my soule at

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600">1600</span></span> Fro
Flegitoun, the fery flood of helle,  
<span id="an_1601"></span> That, though I myght a thousand tymes selle  
<span id="an_1602"></span> Upon a day my lif in thi servise,  
<span id="an_1603"></span> It myghte naught a moote in that suffise.  
<span id="an_1604"></span> "The sonne, which that al the world may se,  
<span id="an_1605"></span> Saugh nevere yet my lif, that dar I leye,  
<span id="an_1606"></span> So inly fair and goodly as is she  
<span id="an_1607"></span> Whos I am al, and shal, tyl that I deye.  
<span id="an_1608"></span> And that I thus am hires, dar I seye,  
<span id="an_1609"></span> That thanked be the heighe worthynesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1610">1610</span></span> Of Love,

<span id="an_1611"></span> "Thus hastow me no litel thing yyive,

<span id="an_1613"></span> My lif. And whi? For thorugh thyn help I
lyve,  
<span id="an_1614"></span> Or elles ded hadde I ben many a day."  
<span id="an_1615"></span> And with that word down in his bed he lay,  
<span id="an_1616"></span> And Pandarus ful sobrely hym herde  
<span id="an_1617"></span> Tyl al was seyd, and than he thus answerde:  
<span id="an_1618"></span> "My deere frend, if I have don for the  
<span id="an_1619"></span> In any cas, God wot, it is me lief,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> And am as
glad as man may of it be,  
<span id="an_1621"></span> God help me so; but tak now nat a-grief  
<span id="an_1622"></span> That I shal seyn: be war of this meschief,  
<span id="an_1623"></span> That, there as thow now brought art in thy

<span id="an_1624"></span> That thow thiself ne cause it nat to misse.  
<span id="an_1625"></span> "For of fortunes sharpe adversitee  
<span id="an_1626"></span> The worste kynde of infortune is this,  
<span id="an_1627"></span> A man to han ben in prosperitee,  
<span id="an_1628"></span> And it remembren whan it passed is.  
<span id="an_1629"></span> Th' art wis ynough; forthi do nat amys:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1630">1630</span></span> Be naught

<span id="an_1631"></span> For if thow be, certeyn it wol the harme.  
<span id="an_1632"></span> "Thow art at ese, and hold the wel
therinne;  
<span id="an_1633"></span> For also seur as reed is every fir,  
<span id="an_1634"></span> As gret a craft is kepe wel as wynne.  
<span id="an_1635"></span> Bridle alwey wel thi speche and thi desir,  
<span id="an_1636"></span> For worldly joie halt nought but by a wir.  
<span id="an_1637"></span> That preveth wel, it brest al day so ofte;  
<span id="an_1638"></span> Forthi nede is to werken with it softe."  
<span id="an_1639"></span> Quod Troilus, "I hope, and God toforn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1640">1640</span></span> My deere
frend, that I shal so me beere  
<span id="an_1641"></span> That in my gylt ther shal nothyng be lorn,  
<span id="an_1642"></span> N' y nyl nought rakle as for to greven

<span id="an_1643"></span> It nedeth naught this matere ofte stere;  
<span id="an_1644"></span> For wystestow myn herte wel, Pandare,  
<span id="an_1645"></span> God woot, of this thow woldest litel care."  
<span id="an_1646"></span> Tho gan he telle hym of his glade nyght,  
<span id="an_1647"></span> And wherof first his herte dred, and how,  
<span id="an_1648"></span> And seyde, "Frend, as I am trewe knyght,  
<span id="an_1649"></span> And by that feyth I shal to God and yow,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1650">1650</span></span> I hadde it
nevere half so hote as now;  
<span id="an_1651"></span> And ay the more that desir me biteth  
<span id="an_1652"></span> To love hire best, the more it me deliteth.  
<span id="an_1653"></span> "I not myself naught wisly what it is,  
<span id="an_1654"></span> But now I feele a newe qualitee --  
<span id="an_1655"></span> Yee, al another than I dide er this."  
<span id="an_1656"></span> Pandare answerd, and seyde thus, that "he  
<span id="an_1657"></span> That ones may in hevene blisse be,  
<span id="an_1658"></span> He feleth other weyes, dar I leye,  
<span id="an_1659"></span> Than thilke tyme he first herde of it
seye."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1660">1660</span></span> This is o
word for al: this Troilus  
<span id="an_1661"></span> Was nevere ful to speke of this matere,  
<span id="an_1662"></span> And for to preisen unto Pandarus  
<span id="an_1663"></span> The bounte of his righte lady deere,  
<span id="an_1664"></span> And Pandarus to thanke and maken cheere.  
<span id="an_1665"></span> This tale ay was span-newe to bygynne,  
<span id="an_1666"></span> Til that the nyght departed hem atwynne.  
<span id="an_1667"></span> Soon after this, for that Fortune it wolde,  
<span id="an_1668"></span> Icomen was the blisful tyme swete  
<span id="an_1669"></span> That Troilus was warned that he sholde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1670">1670</span></span> There he
was erst, Criseyde his lady mete,  
<span id="an_1671"></span> For which he felte his herte in joie flete  
<span id="an_1672"></span> And feithfully gan alle the goddes herie.  
<span id="an_1673"></span> And lat se now if that he kan be merie!  
<span id="an_1674"></span> And holden was the forme and al the wise  
<span id="an_1675"></span> Of hire commyng, and of his also,  
<span id="an_1676"></span> As it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse.  
<span id="an_1677"></span> But pleynly to th' effect right for to go:  
<span id="an_1678"></span> In joie and suerte Pandarus hem two  
<span id="an_1679"></span> Abedde brought, whan that hem bothe leste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1680">1680</span></span> And thus
they ben in quyete and in reste.  
<span id="an_1681"></span> Nought nedeth it to yow, syn they ben met,  
<span id="an_1682"></span> To axe at me if that they blithe were;  
<span id="an_1683"></span> For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet  
<span id="an_1684"></span> A thousand fold; this nedeth nought
enquere.  
<span id="an_1685"></span> Ago was every sorwe and every feere;  
<span id="an_1686"></span> And bothe, ywys, they hadde, and so they
wende,  
<span id="an_1687"></span> As muche joie as herte may comprende.  
<span id="an_1688"></span> This is no litel thyng of for to seye;  
<span id="an_1689"></span> This passeth every wit for to devyse;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1690">1690</span></span> For ech of
hem gan otheres lust obeye.  
<span id="an_1691"></span> Felicite, which that thise clerkes wise  
<span id="an_1692"></span> Comenden so, ne may nought here suffise;  
<span id="an_1693"></span> This joie may nought writen be with inke;  
<span id="an_1694"></span> This passeth al that herte may bythynke.  
<span id="an_1695"></span> But cruel day -- so wailaway the stounde!
--  
<span id="an_1696"></span> Gan for t' aproche, as they by sygnes
knewe,  
<span id="an_1697"></span> For which hem thoughte feelen dethis
wownde.  
<span id="an_1698"></span> So wo was hem that chaungen gan hire hewe,  
<span id="an_1699"></span> And day they gonnen to despise al newe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700">1700</span></span> Callyng it
traitour, envyous, and worse,  
<span id="an_1701"></span> And bitterly the dayes light thei corse.  
<span id="an_1702"></span> Quod Troilus, "Allas, now am I war  
<span id="an_1703"></span> That Piros and tho swifte steedes thre,  
<span id="an_1704"></span> Which that drawen forth the sonnes char,  
<span id="an_1705"></span> Han gon som bi-path in dispit of me;  
<span id="an_1706"></span> That maketh it so soone day to be;  
<span id="an_1707"></span> And for the sonne hym hasteth thus to rise,  
<span id="an_1708"></span> Ne shal I nevere don hire sacrifise."  
<span id="an_1709"></span> But nedes day departe hem moste soone,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1710">1710</span></span> And whan
hire speche don was and hire cheere,  
<span id="an_1711"></span> They twynne anon, as they were wont to
doone,  
<span id="an_1712"></span> And setten tyme of metyng eft yfeere;  
<span id="an_1713"></span> And many a nyght they wroughte in this
manere,  
<span id="an_1714"></span> And thus Fortune a tyme ledde in joie  
<span id="an_1715"></span> Criseyde and ek this kynges sone of Troie.  
<span id="an_1716"></span> In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in
singynges,  
<span id="an_1717"></span> This Troilus gan al his lif to lede.  
<span id="an_1718"></span> He spendeth, jousteth, maketh festeynges;  
<span id="an_1719"></span> He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1720">1720</span></span> And held
aboute hym alwey, out of drede,  
<span id="an_1721"></span> A world of folk, as com hym wel of kynde,  
<span id="an_1722"></span> The fresshest and the beste he koude fynde;  
<span id="an_1723"></span> That swich a vois was of hym and a stevene,  
<span id="an_1724"></span> Thorughout the world, of honour and
largesse,  
<span id="an_1725"></span> That it up rong unto the yate of hevene;  
<span id="an_1726"></span> And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse  
<span id="an_1727"></span> That in his herte he demed, as I gesse,  
<span id="an_1728"></span> That ther nys lovere in this world at ese  
<span id="an_1729"></span> So wel as he; and thus gan love hym plese.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1730">1730</span></span> The
goodlihede or beaute which that kynde  
<span id="an_1731"></span> In any other lady hadde yset  
<span id="an_1732"></span> Kan nought the montance of a knotte unbynde  
<span id="an_1733"></span> Aboute his herte of al Criseydes net.  
<span id="an_1734"></span> He was so narwe ymasked and yknet,  
<span id="an_1735"></span> That it undon on any manere syde,  
<span id="an_1736"></span> That nyl naught ben, for aught that may
bitide.  
<span id="an_1737"></span> And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take  
<span id="an_1738"></span> This Pandarus, and into gardyn lede,  
<span id="an_1739"></span> And swich a feste and swich a proces make  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1740">1740</span></span> Hym of
Criseyde, and of hire wommanhede,  
<span id="an_1741"></span> And of hire beaute, that withouten drede  
<span id="an_1742"></span> It was an hevene his wordes for to here;  
<span id="an_1743"></span> And thanne he wolde synge in this manere:  
<span id="an_1744"></span> "Love, that of erthe and se hath
governaunce,  
<span id="an_1745"></span> Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye,

<span id="an_1757"></span> Al this doth Love, ay heried be his myghtes!
--  
<span id="an_1758"></span> "That, that the se, that gredy is to

<span id="an_1765"></span> "So wolde God, that auctour is of kynde,

<span id="an_1772"></span> In alle nedes for the townes werre  
<span id="an_1773"></span> He was, and ay, the first in armes dyght,  
<span id="an_1774"></span> And certeynly, but if that bokes erre,  
<span id="an_1775"></span> Save Ector most ydred of any wight;  
<span id="an_1776"></span> And this encrees of hardynesse and myght  
<span id="an_1777"></span> Com hym of love, his ladies thank to wynne,  
<span id="an_1778"></span> That altered his spirit so withinne.  
<span id="an_1779"></span> In tyme of trewe, on haukyng wolde he ride,

<span id="an_1785"></span> Ful redy was hym goodly to saluwe.  
<span id="an_1786"></span> And moost of love and vertu was his speche,  
<span id="an_1787"></span> And in despit hadde alle wrecchednesse;  
<span id="an_1788"></span> And douteles, no nede was hym biseche
