#### Troilus and Criseyde

### Book 1

<span id="an_1"></span> The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,  
<span id="an_2"></span> That was the kyng Priamus sone of Troye,  
<span id="an_3"></span> In lovynge, how his aventures fellen  
<span id="an_4"></span> Fro wo to wele, and after out of joie,  
<span id="an_5"></span> My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye.  
<span id="an_6"></span> Thesiphone, thow help me for t' endite  
<span id="an_7"></span> Thise woful vers, that wepen as I write.  
<span id="an_8"></span> To the clepe I, thow goddesse of torment,  
<span id="an_9"></span> Thow cruwel Furie, sorwynge evere in peyne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Help me, that
am the sorwful instrument,  
<span id="an_11"></span> That helpeth loveres, as I kan, to pleyne;  
<span id="an_12"></span> For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,  
<span id="an_13"></span> A woful wight to han a drery feere,  
<span id="an_14"></span> And to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.  
<span id="an_15"></span> For I, that God of Loves servantz serve,  
<span id="an_16"></span> Ne dar to Love, for myn unliklynesse,  
<span id="an_17"></span> Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfore
sterve,  
<span id="an_18"></span> So fer am I from his help in derknesse.  
<span id="an_19"></span> But natheles, if this may don gladnesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> Unto any
lovere, and his cause availle,  
<span id="an_21"></span> Have he my thonk, and myn be this travaille!  
<span id="an_22"></span> But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,  
<span id="an_23"></span> If any drope of pyte in yow be,  
<span id="an_24"></span> Remembreth yow on passed hevynesse  
<span id="an_25"></span> That ye han felt, and on the adversite  
<span id="an_26"></span> Of othere folk, and thynketh how that ye  
<span id="an_27"></span> Han felt that Love dorste yow displese,  
<span id="an_28"></span> Or ye han wonne hym with to gret an ese.  
<span id="an_29"></span> And preieth for hem that ben in the cas  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Of Troilus, as
ye may after here,  
<span id="an_31"></span> That Love hem brynge in hevene to solas;  
<span id="an_32"></span> And ek for me preieth to God so dere  
<span id="an_33"></span> That I have myght to shewe, in som manere,  
<span id="an_34"></span> Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,  
<span id="an_35"></span> In Troilus unsely aventure.  
<span id="an_36"></span> And biddeth ek for hem that ben despeired  
<span id="an_37"></span> In love, that nevere nyl recovered be,  
<span id="an_38"></span> And ek for hem that falsly ben apeired  
<span id="an_39"></span> Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> Thus biddeth
God, for his benignite,  
<span id="an_41"></span> So graunte hem soone owt of this world to
pace,  
<span id="an_42"></span> That ben despeired out of Loves grace.  
<span id="an_43"></span> And biddeth ek for hem that ben at ese,  
<span id="an_44"></span> That God hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,  
<span id="an_45"></span> And sende hem myght hire ladies so to plese  
<span id="an_46"></span> That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.  
<span id="an_47"></span> For so hope I my sowle best avaunce,  
<span id="an_48"></span> To prey for hem that Loves servauntz be,  
<span id="an_49"></span> And write hire wo, and lyve in charite,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> And for to have
of hem compassioun,  
<span id="an_51"></span> As though I were hire owne brother dere.  
<span id="an_52"></span> Now herkneth with a good entencioun,  
<span id="an_53"></span> For now wil I gon streght to my matere,  
<span id="an_54"></span> In which ye may the double sorwes here  
<span id="an_55"></span> Of Troilus in lovynge of Criseyde,  
<span id="an_56"></span> And how that she forsook hym er she deyde.  
<span id="an_57"></span> Yt is wel wist how that the Grekes stronge  
<span id="an_58"></span> In armes with a thousand shippes wente  
<span id="an_59"></span> To Troiewardes, and the cite longe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Assegeden,
neigh ten yer er they stente,  
<span id="an_61"></span> And in diverse wise and oon entente,  
<span id="an_62"></span> The ravysshyng to wreken of Eleyne,  
<span id="an_63"></span> By Paris don, they wroughten al hir peyne.  
<span id="an_64"></span> Now fel it so that in the town ther was  
<span id="an_65"></span> Dwellynge a lord of gret auctorite,  
<span id="an_66"></span> A gret devyn, that clepid was Calkas,  
<span id="an_67"></span> That in science so expert was that he  
<span id="an_68"></span> Knew wel that Troie sholde destroied be,  
<span id="an_69"></span> By answere of his god, that highte thus:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> Daun Phebus or
Appollo Delphicus.  
<span id="an_71"></span> So whan this Calkas knew by calkulynge,  
<span id="an_72"></span> And ek by answer of this Appollo,  
<span id="an_73"></span> That Grekes sholden swich a peple brynge,  
<span id="an_74"></span> Thorugh which that Troie moste ben fordo,  
<span id="an_75"></span> He caste anon out of the town to go;  
<span id="an_76"></span> For wel wiste he by sort that Troye sholde  
<span id="an_77"></span> Destroyed ben, ye, wolde whoso nolde.  
<span id="an_78"></span> For which for to departen softely  
<span id="an_79"></span> Took purpos ful this forknowynge wise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> And to the
Grekes oost ful pryvely  
<span id="an_81"></span> He stal anon; and they, in curteys wise,  
<span id="an_82"></span> Hym diden bothe worship and servyce,  
<span id="an_83"></span> In trust that he hath konnynge hem to rede  
<span id="an_84"></span> In every peril which that is to drede.  
<span id="an_85"></span> Gret rumour gan, whan it was first aspied  
<span id="an_86"></span> Thorugh al the town, and generaly was spoken,  
<span id="an_87"></span> That Calkas traitour fled was and allied  
<span id="an_88"></span> With hem of Grece, and casten to be wroken  
<span id="an_89"></span> On hym that falsly hadde his feith so broken,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> And seyden he
and al his kyn at-ones  
<span id="an_91"></span> Ben worthi for to brennen, fel and bones.  
<span id="an_92"></span> Now hadde Calkas left in this meschaunce,  
<span id="an_93"></span> Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,  
<span id="an_94"></span> His doughter, which that was in gret
penaunce,  
<span id="an_95"></span> For of hire lif she was ful sore in drede,  
<span id="an_96"></span> As she that nyste what was best to rede;  
<span id="an_97"></span> For bothe a widewe was she and allone  
<span id="an_98"></span> Of any frend to whom she dorste hir mone.  
<span id="an_99"></span> Criseyde was this lady name al right.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> As to my
doom, in al Troies cite  
<span id="an_101"></span> Nas non so fair, forpassynge every wight,  
<span id="an_102"></span> So aungelik was hir natif beaute,  
<span id="an_103"></span> That lik a thing inmortal semed she,  
<span id="an_104"></span> As doth an hevenyssh perfit creature,  
<span id="an_105"></span> That down were sent in scornynge of nature.  
<span id="an_106"></span> This lady, which that alday herd at ere  
<span id="an_107"></span> Hire fadres shame, his falsnesse and
tresoun,  
<span id="an_108"></span> Wel neigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,  
<span id="an_109"></span> In widewes habit large of samyt broun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> On knees she
fil biforn Ector adown  
<span id="an_111"></span> With pitous vois, and tendrely wepynge,  
<span id="an_112"></span> His mercy bad, hirselven excusynge.  
<span id="an_113"></span> Now was this Ector pitous of nature,  
<span id="an_114"></span> And saugh that she was sorwfully bigon,  
<span id="an_115"></span> And that she was so fair a creature;  
<span id="an_116"></span> Of his goodnesse he gladede hire anon,  
<span id="an_117"></span> And seyde, "Lat youre fadres treson gon  
<span id="an_118"></span> Forth with meschaunce, and ye youreself in
joie  
<span id="an_119"></span> Dwelleth with us, whil yow good list, in
Troie.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> "And al th'
onour that men may don yow have,  
<span id="an_121"></span> As ferforth as youre fader dwelled here,  
<span id="an_122"></span> Ye shul have, and youre body shal men save,  
<span id="an_123"></span> As fer as I may ought enquere or here."  
<span id="an_124"></span> And she hym thonked with ful humble chere,  
<span id="an_125"></span> And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,  
<span id="an_126"></span> And took hire leve, and hom, and held hir
stille.  
<span id="an_127"></span> And in hire hous she abood with swich meyne  
<span id="an_128"></span> As til hire honour nede was to holde;  
<span id="an_129"></span> And whil she was dwellynge in that cite,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Kepte hir
estat, and both of yonge and olde  
<span id="an_131"></span> Ful wel biloved, and wel men of hir tolde.  
<span id="an_132"></span> But wheither that she children hadde or
noon,  
<span id="an_133"></span> I rede it naught, therfore I late it goon.  
<span id="an_134"></span> The thynges fellen, as they don of werre,  
<span id="an_135"></span> Bitwixen hem of Troie and Grekes ofte;  
<span id="an_136"></span> For som day boughten they of Troie it derre,  
<span id="an_137"></span> And eft the Grekes founden nothing softe  
<span id="an_138"></span> The folk of Troie; and thus Fortune on lofte  
<span id="an_139"></span> And under eft gan hem to whielen bothe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Aftir hir
course, ay whil that thei were wrothe.  
<span id="an_141"></span> But how this town com to destruccion  
<span id="an_142"></span> Ne falleth naught to purpos me to telle,  
<span id="an_143"></span> For it were a long digression  
<span id="an_144"></span> Fro my matere, and yow to long to dwelle.  
<span id="an_145"></span> But the Troian gestes, as they felle,  
<span id="an_146"></span> In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dite,  
<span id="an_147"></span> Whoso that kan may rede hem as they write.  
<span id="an_148"></span> But though that Grekes hem of Troie shetten,  
<span id="an_149"></span> And hir cite biseged al aboute,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> Hire olde
usage nolde they nat letten,  
<span id="an_151"></span> As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;  
<span id="an_152"></span> But aldirmost in honour, out of doute,  
<span id="an_153"></span> Thei hadde a relik, heet Palladion,  
<span id="an_154"></span> That was hire trist aboven everichon.  
<span id="an_155"></span> And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme  
<span id="an_156"></span> Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede  
<span id="an_157"></span> With newe grene, of lusty Veer the pryme,  
<span id="an_158"></span> And swote smellen floures white and rede,  
<span id="an_159"></span> In sondry wises shewed, as I rede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> The folk of
Troie hire observaunces olde,  
<span id="an_161"></span> Palladiones feste for to holde.  
<span id="an_162"></span> And to the temple, in al hir beste wise,  
<span id="an_163"></span> In general ther wente many a wight,  
<span id="an_164"></span> To herknen of Palladions servyce;  
<span id="an_165"></span> And namely, so many a lusty knyght,  
<span id="an_166"></span> So many a lady fressh and mayden bright,  
<span id="an_167"></span> Ful wel arayed, both meeste, mene, and
leste,  
<span id="an_168"></span> Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.  
<span id="an_169"></span> Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> In widewes
habit blak; but natheles,  
<span id="an_171"></span> Right as oure firste lettre is now an A,  
<span id="an_172"></span> In beaute first so stood she, makeles.  
<span id="an_173"></span> Hire goodly lokyng gladed al the prees.  
<span id="an_174"></span> Nas nevere yet seyn thyng to ben preysed
derre,  
<span id="an_175"></span> Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre  
<span id="an_176"></span> As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichone  
<span id="an_177"></span> That hir behelden in hir blake wede.  
<span id="an_178"></span> And yet she stood ful lowe and stille
allone,  
<span id="an_179"></span> Byhynden other folk, in litel brede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> And neigh the
dore, ay undre shames drede,  
<span id="an_181"></span> Simple of atir and debonaire of chere,  
<span id="an_182"></span> With ful assured lokyng and manere.  
<span id="an_183"></span> This Troilus, as he was wont to gide  
<span id="an_184"></span> His yonge knyghtes, lad hem up and down  
<span id="an_185"></span> In thilke large temple on every side,  
<span id="an_186"></span> Byholding ay the ladies of the town,  
<span id="an_187"></span> Now here, now there; for no devocioun  
<span id="an_188"></span> Hadde he to non, to reven hym his reste,  
<span id="an_189"></span> But gan to preise and lakken whom hym leste.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> And in his
walk ful faste he gan to wayten  
<span id="an_191"></span> If knyght or squyer of his compaignie  
<span id="an_192"></span> Gan for to syke, or lete his eighen baiten  
<span id="an_193"></span> On any womman that he koude espye.  
<span id="an_194"></span> He wolde smyle and holden it folye,  
<span id="an_195"></span> And seye hym thus, "God woot, she slepeth
softe  
<span id="an_196"></span> For love of the, whan thow turnest ful ofte!  
<span id="an_197"></span> "I have herd told, pardieux, of youre
lyvynge,  
<span id="an_198"></span> Ye loveres, and youre lewed observaunces,  
<span id="an_199"></span> And which a labour folk han in wynnynge  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> Of love, and
in the kepyng which doutaunces;  
<span id="an_201"></span> And whan youre prey is lost, woo and
penaunces.  
<span id="an_202"></span> O veray fooles, nyce and blynde be ye!  
<span id="an_203"></span> Ther nys nat oon kan war by other be."  
<span id="an_204"></span> And with that word he gan caste up the
browe,  
<span id="an_205"></span> Ascaunces, "Loo! is this naught wisely
spoken?"  
<span id="an_206"></span> At which the God of Love gan loken rowe  
<span id="an_207"></span> Right for despit, and shop for to ben
wroken.  
<span id="an_208"></span> He kidde anon his bowe nas naught broken;  
<span id="an_209"></span> For sodeynly he hitte hym atte fulle --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> And yet as
proud a pekok kan he pulle.  
<span id="an_211"></span> O blynde world, O blynde entencioun!  
<span id="an_212"></span> How often falleth al the effect contraire  
<span id="an_213"></span> Of surquidrie and foul presumpcioun;  
<span id="an_214"></span> For kaught is proud, and kaught is
debonaire.  
<span id="an_215"></span> This Troilus is clomben on the staire,  
<span id="an_216"></span> And litel weneth that he moot descenden;  
<span id="an_217"></span> But alday faileth thing that fooles wenden.  
<span id="an_218"></span> As proude Bayard gynneth for to skippe  
<span id="an_219"></span> Out of the weye, so pryketh hym his corn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> Til he a
lasshe have of the longe whippe --  
<span id="an_221"></span> Than thynketh he, "Though I praunce al
byforn  
<span id="an_222"></span> First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn,  
<span id="an_223"></span> Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe  
<span id="an_224"></span> I moot endure, and with my feres drawe" --  
<span id="an_225"></span> So ferde it by this fierse and proude
knyght:  
<span id="an_226"></span> Though he a worthy kynges sone were,  
<span id="an_227"></span> And wende nothing hadde had swich myght  
<span id="an_228"></span> Ayeyns his wille that shuld his herte stere,  
<span id="an_229"></span> Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> That he that
now was moost in pride above,  
<span id="an_231"></span> Wax sodeynly moost subgit unto love.  
<span id="an_232"></span> Forthy ensample taketh of this man,  
<span id="an_233"></span> Ye wise, proude, and worthi folkes alle,  
<span id="an_234"></span> To scornen Love, which that so soone kan  
<span id="an_235"></span> The fredom of youre hertes to hym thralle;  
<span id="an_236"></span> For evere it was, and evere it shal byfalle,  
<span id="an_237"></span> That Love is he that alle thing may bynde,  
<span id="an_238"></span> For may no man fordon the lawe of kynde.  
<span id="an_239"></span> That this be soth, hath preved and doth yit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> For this
trowe I ye knowen alle or some,  
<span id="an_241"></span> Men reden nat that folk han gretter wit  
<span id="an_242"></span> Than they that han be most with love ynome;  
<span id="an_243"></span> And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,  
<span id="an_244"></span> The worthiest and grettest of degree:  
<span id="an_245"></span> This was, and is, and yet men shall it see.  
<span id="an_246"></span> And trewelich it sit wel to be so,  
<span id="an_247"></span> For alderwisest han therwith ben plesed;  
<span id="an_248"></span> And they that han ben aldermost in wo,  
<span id="an_249"></span> With love han ben comforted moost and esed;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> And ofte it
hath the cruel herte apesed,  
<span id="an_251"></span> And worthi folk maad worthier of name,  
<span id="an_252"></span> And causeth moost to dreden vice and shame.  
<span id="an_253"></span> Now sith it may nat goodly ben withstonde,  
<span id="an_254"></span> And is a thing so vertuous in kynde,  
<span id="an_255"></span> Refuseth nat to Love for to ben bonde,  
<span id="an_256"></span> Syn, as hymselven liste, he may yow bynde;  
<span id="an_257"></span> The yerde is bet that bowen wole and wynde  
<span id="an_258"></span> Than that that brest, and therfore I yow
rede  
<span id="an_259"></span> To folowen hym that so wel kan yow lede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> But for to
tellen forth in special  
<span id="an_261"></span> Of this kynges sone of which I tolde,  
<span id="an_262"></span> And leten other thing collateral,  
<span id="an_263"></span> Of hym thenke I my tale forth to holde,  
<span id="an_264"></span> Both of his joie and of his cares colde;  
<span id="an_265"></span> And al his werk, as touching this matere,  
<span id="an_266"></span> For I it gan, I wol therto refere.  
<span id="an_267"></span> Withinne the temple he wente hym forth
pleyinge,  
<span id="an_268"></span> This Troilus, of every wight aboute,  
<span id="an_269"></span> On this lady, and now on that, lokynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> Wher so she
were of town or of withoute;  
<span id="an_271"></span> And upon cas bifel that thorugh a route  
<span id="an_272"></span> His eye percede, and so depe it wente,  
<span id="an_273"></span> Til on Criseyde it smot, and ther it stente.  
<span id="an_274"></span> And sodeynly he wax therwith astoned,  
<span id="an_275"></span> And gan hir bet biholde in thrifty wise.  
<span id="an_276"></span> "O mercy, God," thoughte he, "wher hastow
woned,  
<span id="an_277"></span> That art so feyr and goodly to devise?"  
<span id="an_278"></span> Therwith his herte gan to sprede and rise,  
<span id="an_279"></span> And softe sighed, lest men myghte hym here,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> And caught
ayeyn his firste pleyinge chere.  
<span id="an_281"></span> She nas nat with the leste of hire stature,  
<span id="an_282"></span> But alle hire lymes so wel answerynge  
<span id="an_283"></span> Weren to wommanhod, that creature  
<span id="an_284"></span> Was nevere lasse mannyssh in semynge;  
<span id="an_285"></span> And ek the pure wise of hire mevynge  
<span id="an_286"></span> Shewed wel that men myght in hire gesse  
<span id="an_287"></span> Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse.  
<span id="an_288"></span> To Troilus right wonder wel with alle  
<span id="an_289"></span> Gan for to like hire mevynge and hire chere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> Which somdel
deignous was, for she let falle  
<span id="an_291"></span> Hire look a lite aside in swich manere,  
<span id="an_292"></span> Ascaunces, "What, may I nat stonden here?"  
<span id="an_293"></span> And after that hir lokynge gan she lighte,  
<span id="an_294"></span> That nevere thoughte hym seen so good a
syghte.  
<span id="an_295"></span> And of hire look in him ther gan to quyken  
<span id="an_296"></span> So gret desir and such affeccioun,  
<span id="an_297"></span> That in his herte botme gan to stiken  
<span id="an_298"></span> Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun.  
<span id="an_299"></span> And though he erst hadde poured up and down,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> He was tho
glad his hornes in to shrinke:  
<span id="an_301"></span> Unnethes wiste he how to loke or wynke.  
<span id="an_302"></span> Lo, he that leet hymselven so konnynge,  
<span id="an_303"></span> And scorned hem that Loves peynes dryen,  
<span id="an_304"></span> Was ful unwar that Love hadde his dwellynge  
<span id="an_305"></span> Withinne the subtile stremes of hire yen;  
<span id="an_306"></span> That sodeynly hym thoughte he felte dyen,  
<span id="an_307"></span> Right with hire look, the spirit in his
herte:  
<span id="an_308"></span> Blissed be Love, that kan thus folk
converte!  
<span id="an_309"></span> She, this in blak, likynge to Troilus  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310">310</span></span> Over alle
thing, he stood for to biholde;  
<span id="an_311"></span> Ne his desir, ne wherfore he stood thus,  
<span id="an_312"></span> He neither chere made, ne word tolde;  
<span id="an_313"></span> But from afer, his manere for to holde,  
<span id="an_314"></span> On other thing his look som tyme he caste,  
<span id="an_315"></span> And eft on hire, whil that servyse laste.  
<span id="an_316"></span> And after this, nat fullich al awhaped,  
<span id="an_317"></span> Out of the temple al esilich he wente,  
<span id="an_318"></span> Repentynge hym that he hadde evere ijaped  
<span id="an_319"></span> Of Loves folk, lest fully the descente  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> Of scorn
fille on hymself; but what he mente,  
<span id="an_321"></span> Lest it were wist on any manere syde,  
<span id="an_322"></span> His woo he gan dissimilen and hide.  
<span id="an_323"></span> Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,  
<span id="an_324"></span> He streght anon unto his paleys torneth.  
<span id="an_325"></span> Right with hire look thorugh-shoten and
thorugh-darted,  
<span id="an_326"></span> Al feyneth he in lust that he sojorneth,  
<span id="an_327"></span> And al his chere and speche also he borneth,  
<span id="an_328"></span> And ay of Loves servantz every while,  
<span id="an_329"></span> Hymself to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> And seyde,
"Lord, so ye lyve al in lest,  
<span id="an_331"></span> Ye loveres! For the konnyngeste of yow,  
<span id="an_332"></span> That serveth most ententiflich and best,  
<span id="an_333"></span> Hym tit as often harm therof as prow.  
<span id="an_334"></span> Youre hire is quyt ayeyn, ye, God woot how!  
<span id="an_335"></span> Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good
servyse.  
<span id="an_336"></span> In feith, youre ordre is ruled in good wise!  
<span id="an_337"></span> "In nouncerteyn ben alle youre observaunces,  
<span id="an_338"></span> But it a sely fewe pointes be;  
<span id="an_339"></span> Ne no thing asketh so gret attendaunces  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> As doth youre
lay, and that knowe alle ye;  
<span id="an_341"></span> But that is nat the worste, as mote I the!  
<span id="an_342"></span> But, tolde I yow the worste point, I leve,  
<span id="an_343"></span> Al seyde I soth, ye wolden at me greve.  
<span id="an_344"></span> "But take this: that ye loveres ofte
eschuwe,  
<span id="an_345"></span> Or elles doon, of good entencioun,  
<span id="an_346"></span> Ful ofte thi lady wol it mysconstruwe,  
<span id="an_347"></span> And deme it harm in hire oppynyoun;  
<span id="an_348"></span> And yet if she, for other enchesoun,  
<span id="an_349"></span> Be wroth, than shaltow have a groyn anon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> Lord, wel is
hym that may ben of yow oon!"  
<span id="an_351"></span> But for al this, whan that he say his tyme,  
<span id="an_352"></span> He held his pees -- non other boote hym gayned
--  
<span id="an_353"></span> For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme  
<span id="an_354"></span> That wel unnethe until his folk he fayned  
<span id="an_355"></span> That other besy nedes hym destrayned;  
<span id="an_356"></span> For wo was hym, that what to doon he nyste,  
<span id="an_357"></span> But bad his folk to gon wher that hem liste.  
<span id="an_358"></span> And whan that he in chambre was allone,  
<span id="an_359"></span> He doun upon his beddes feet hym sette,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> And first he
gan to sike, and eft to grone,  
<span id="an_361"></span> And thought ay on hire so, withouten lette,  
<span id="an_362"></span> That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette  
<span id="an_363"></span> That he hire saugh a-temple, and al the wise  
<span id="an_364"></span> Right of hire look, and gan it newe avise.  
<span id="an_365"></span> Thus gan he make a mirour of his mynde  
<span id="an_366"></span> In which he saugh al holly hire figure,  
<span id="an_367"></span> And that he wel koude in his herte fynde.  
<span id="an_368"></span> It was to hym a right good aventure  
<span id="an_369"></span> To love swich oon, and if he dede his cure  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> To serven
hir, yet myghte he falle in grace,  
<span id="an_371"></span> Or ellis for oon of hire servantz pace.  
<span id="an_372"></span> Imagenynge that travaille nor grame  
<span id="an_373"></span> Ne myghte for so goodly oon be lorn  
<span id="an_374"></span> As she, ne hym for his desir no shame,  
<span id="an_375"></span> Al were it wist, but in pris and up-born  
<span id="an_376"></span> Of alle lovers wel more than biforn,  
<span id="an_377"></span> Thus argumented he in his gynnynge,  
<span id="an_378"></span> Ful unavysed of his woo comynge.  
<span id="an_379"></span> Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> And thoughte
he wolde werken pryvely,  
<span id="an_381"></span> First to hiden his desir in muwe  
<span id="an_382"></span> From every wight yborn, al outrely,  
<span id="an_383"></span> But he myghte ought recovered be therby,  
<span id="an_384"></span> Remembryng hym that love to wide yblowe  
<span id="an_385"></span> Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be
sowe.  
<span id="an_386"></span> And over al this, yet muchel more he
thoughte  
<span id="an_387"></span> What for to speke, and what to holden inne;  
<span id="an_388"></span> And what to arten hire to love he soughte,  
<span id="an_389"></span> And on a song anon-right to bygynne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> And gan loude
on his sorwe for to wynne;  
<span id="an_391"></span> For with good hope he gan fully assente  
<span id="an_392"></span> Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.  
<span id="an_393"></span> And of his song naught only the sentence,  
<span id="an_394"></span> As writ myn auctour called Lollius,  
<span id="an_395"></span> But pleinly, save oure tonges difference,  
<span id="an_396"></span> I dar wel seyn, in al, that Troilus  
<span id="an_397"></span> Seyde in his song, loo, every word right
thus  
<span id="an_398"></span> As I shal seyn; and whoso list it here,  
<span id="an_399"></span> Loo, next this vers he may it fynden here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> "If no love
is, O God, what fele I so?  
<span id="an_401"></span> And if love is, what thing and which is he?  
<span id="an_402"></span> If love be good, from whennes cometh my woo?  
<span id="an_403"></span> If it be wikke, a wonder thynketh me,  
<span id="an_404"></span> When every torment and adversite  
<span id="an_405"></span> That cometh of hym may to me savory thinke,  
<span id="an_406"></span> For ay thurst I, the more that ich it
drynke.  
<span id="an_407"></span> "And if that at myn owen lust I brenne,  
<span id="an_408"></span> From whennes cometh my waillynge and my
pleynte?  
<span id="an_409"></span> If harm agree me, wherto pleyne I thenne?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> I noot, ne
whi unwery that I feynte.  
<span id="an_411"></span> O quike deth, O swete harm so queynte,  
<span id="an_412"></span> How may of the in me swich quantite,  
<span id="an_413"></span> But if that I consente that it be?  
<span id="an_414"></span> "And if that I consente, I wrongfully  
<span id="an_415"></span> Compleyne, iwis. Thus possed to and fro,  
<span id="an_416"></span> Al sterelees withinne a boot am I  
<span id="an_417"></span> Amydde the see, bitwixen wyndes two,  
<span id="an_418"></span> That in contrarie stonden evere mo.  
<span id="an_419"></span> Allas, what is this wondre maladie?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> For hote of
cold, for cold of hote, I dye."  
<span id="an_421"></span> And to the God of Love thus seyde he  
<span id="an_422"></span> With pitous vois, "O lord, now youres is  
<span id="an_423"></span> My spirit, which that oughte youres be.  
<span id="an_424"></span> Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to
this.  
<span id="an_425"></span> But wheither goddesse or womman, iwis,  
<span id="an_426"></span> She be, I not, which that ye do me serve;  
<span id="an_427"></span> But as hire man I wol ay lyve and sterve.  
<span id="an_428"></span> "Ye stonden in hir eighen myghtily,  
<span id="an_429"></span> As in a place unto youre vertu digne;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> Wherfore,
lord, if my service or I  
<span id="an_431"></span> May liken yow, so beth to me benigne;  
<span id="an_432"></span> For myn estat roial I here resigne  
<span id="an_433"></span> Into hire hond, and with ful humble chere  
<span id="an_434"></span> Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere."  
<span id="an_435"></span> In hym ne deyned spare blood roial  
<span id="an_436"></span> The fyr of love -- wherfro God me blesse --  
<span id="an_437"></span> Ne him forbar in no degree, for al  
<span id="an_438"></span> His vertu or his excellent prowesse,  
<span id="an_439"></span> But held hym as his thral lowe in destresse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> And brende
hym so in soundry wise ay newe,  
<span id="an_441"></span> That sexti tyme a day he loste his hewe.  
<span id="an_442"></span> So muche, day by day, his owene thought,  
<span id="an_443"></span> For lust to hire, gan quiken and encresse,  
<span id="an_444"></span> That every other charge he sette at nought.  
<span id="an_445"></span> Forthi ful ofte, his hote fir to cesse,  
<span id="an_446"></span> To sen hire goodly lok he gan to presse;  
<span id="an_447"></span> For therby to ben esed wel he wende,  
<span id="an_448"></span> And ay the ner he was, the more he brende.  
<span id="an_449"></span> For ay the ner the fir, the hotter is --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> This, trowe
I, knoweth al this compaignye;  
<span id="an_451"></span> But were he fer or ner, I dar sey this:  
<span id="an_452"></span> By nyght or day, for wisdom or folye,  
<span id="an_453"></span> His herte, which that is his brestez ye,  
<span id="an_454"></span> Was ay on hire, that fairer was to sene  
<span id="an_455"></span> Than evere were Eleyne or Polixene.  
<span id="an_456"></span> Ek of the day ther passed nought an houre  
<span id="an_457"></span> That to hymself a thousand tyme he seyde,  
<span id="an_458"></span> "Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure  
<span id="an_459"></span> As I best kan, now wolde God, Criseyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> Ye wolden on
me rewe, er that I deyde!  
<span id="an_461"></span> My dere herte, allas, myn hele and hewe  
<span id="an_462"></span> And lif is lost, but ye wol on me rewe!"  
<span id="an_463"></span> Alle other dredes weren from him fledde,  
<span id="an_464"></span> Both of th' assege and his savacioun;  
<span id="an_465"></span> N' yn him desir noon other fownes bredde,  
<span id="an_466"></span> But argumentes to his conclusioun:  
<span id="an_467"></span> That she of him wolde han compassioun,  
<span id="an_468"></span> And he to ben hire man while he may dure.  
<span id="an_469"></span> Lo, here his lif, and from the deth his
cure!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> The sharpe
shoures felle of armes preve  
<span id="an_471"></span> That Ector or his othere brethren diden  
<span id="an_472"></span> Ne made hym only therfore ones meve;  
<span id="an_473"></span> And yet was he, where so men wente or riden,  
<span id="an_474"></span> Founde oon the beste, and longest tyme
abiden  
<span id="an_475"></span> Ther peril was, and dide ek swich travaille  
<span id="an_476"></span> In armes, that to thenke it was merveille.  
<span id="an_477"></span> But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,  
<span id="an_478"></span> Ne also for the rescous of the town,  
<span id="an_479"></span> Ne made hym thus in armes for to madde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> But only, lo,
for this conclusioun:  
<span id="an_481"></span> To liken hire the bet for his renoun.  
<span id="an_482"></span> Fro day to day in armes so he spedde  
<span id="an_483"></span> That the Grekes as the deth him dredde.  
<span id="an_484"></span> And fro this forth tho refte hym love his
slep,  
<span id="an_485"></span> And made his mete his foo, and ek his sorwe  
<span id="an_486"></span> Gan multiplie, that, whoso tok kep,  
<span id="an_487"></span> It shewed in his hewe both eve and morwe.  
<span id="an_488"></span> Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe  
<span id="an_489"></span> Of other siknesse, lest men of hym wende  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> That the hote
fir of love hym brende,  
<span id="an_491"></span> And seyde he hadde a fevere and ferde amys.  
<span id="an_492"></span> But how it was, certeyn, kan I nat seye,  
<span id="an_493"></span> If that his lady understood nat this,  
<span id="an_494"></span> Or feynede hire she nyste, oon of the tweye;  
<span id="an_495"></span> But wel I rede that, by no manere weye,  
<span id="an_496"></span> Ne semed it that she of hym roughte,  
<span id="an_497"></span> Or of his peyne, or whatsoevere he thoughte.  
<span id="an_498"></span> But thanne felte this Troilus swich wo  
<span id="an_499"></span> That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> Was this,
that she som wight hadde loved so,  
<span id="an_501"></span> That nevere of hym she wolde han taken hede,  
<span id="an_502"></span> For which hym thoughte he felte his herte
blede;  
<span id="an_503"></span> Ne of his wo ne dorste he nat bygynne  
<span id="an_504"></span> To tellen hir, for al this world to wynne.  
<span id="an_505"></span> But whan he hadde a space from his care,  
<span id="an_506"></span> Thus to hymself ful ofte he gan to pleyne;  
<span id="an_507"></span> He seyde, "O fool, now artow in the snare,  
<span id="an_508"></span> That whilom japedest at loves peyne.  
<span id="an_509"></span> Now artow hent, now gnaw thin owen cheyne!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> Thow were ay

<span id="an_512"></span> "What wol now every lovere seyn of the,  
<span id="an_513"></span> If this be wist, but evere in thin absence  
<span id="an_514"></span> Laughen in scorn, and seyn, \`Loo, ther goth

<span id="an_515"></span> That is the man of so gret sapience,  
<span id="an_516"></span> That held us loveres leest in reverence.  
<span id="an_517"></span> Now, thanked God, he may gon in the daunce  
<span id="an_518"></span> Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce.'  
<span id="an_519"></span> "But, O thow woful Troilus, God wolde,

<span id="an_525"></span> And thow fordon as snow in fire is soone.  
<span id="an_526"></span> "God wold I were aryved in the port

<span id="an_1058"></span> This Pandarus, tho desirous to serve  
<span id="an_1059"></span> His fulle frend, than seyde in this manere:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060">1060</span></span> "Farwell,
and thenk I wol thi thank deserve!  
<span id="an_1061"></span> Have here my trowthe, and that thow shalt wel

<span id="an_1062"></span> And went his wey, thenkyng on this matere,  
<span id="an_1063"></span> And how he best myghte hire biseche of
grace,  
<span id="an_1064"></span> And fynde a tyme therto, and a place.  
<span id="an_1065"></span> For everi wight that hath an hous to founde  
<span id="an_1066"></span> Ne renneth naught the werk for to bygynne  
<span id="an_1067"></span> With rakel hond, but he wol bide a stounde,  
<span id="an_1068"></span> And sende his hertes line out fro withinne

<span id="an_1072"></span> But Troilus lay tho no lenger down,  
<span id="an_1073"></span> But up anon upon his stede bay,  
<span id="an_1074"></span> And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun;  
<span id="an_1075"></span> Wo was that Grek that with hym mette a-day!  
<span id="an_1076"></span> And in the town his manere tho forth ay  
<span id="an_1077"></span> So goodly was, and gat hym so in grace,  
<span id="an_1078"></span> That ecch hym loved that loked on his face.  
<span id="an_1079"></span> For he bicom the frendlieste wight,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> The
