#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Franklin's Tale

<span id="an_729"></span> In Armorik, that called is Britayne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730">730</span></span> Ther was a
knyght that loved and dide his payne  
<span id="an_731"></span> To serve a lady in his beste wise;  
<span id="an_732"></span> And many a labour, many a greet emprise,  
<span id="an_733"></span> He for his lady wroghte er she were wonne.  
<span id="an_734"></span> For she was oon the faireste under sonne,  
<span id="an_735"></span> And eek therto comen of so heigh kynrede  
<span id="an_736"></span> That wel unnethes dorste this knyght, for
drede,  
<span id="an_737"></span> Telle hire his wo, his peyne, and his
distresse.  
<span id="an_738"></span> But atte laste she, for his worthynesse,  
<span id="an_739"></span> And namely for his meke obeysaunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> Hath swich a
pitee caught of his penaunce  
<span id="an_741"></span> That pryvely she fil of his accord  
<span id="an_742"></span> To take hym for hir housbonde and hir lord,  
<span id="an_743"></span> Of swich lordshipe as men han over hir
wyves.  
<span id="an_744"></span> And for to lede the moore in blisse hir
lyves,  
<span id="an_745"></span> Of his free wyl he swoor hire as a knyght  
<span id="an_746"></span> That nevere in al his lyf he, day ne nyght,  
<span id="an_747"></span> Ne sholde upon hym take no maistrie  
<span id="an_748"></span> Agayn hir wyl, ne kithe hire jalousie,  
<span id="an_749"></span> But hire obeye, and folwe hir wyl in al,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> As any lovere
to his lady shal,  
<span id="an_751"></span> Save that the name of soveraynetee,  
<span id="an_752"></span> That wolde he have for shame of his degree.  
<span id="an_753"></span> She thanked hym, and with ful greet
humblesse  
<span id="an_754"></span> She seyde, "Sire, sith of youre gentillesse  
<span id="an_755"></span> Ye profre me to have so large a reyne,  
<span id="an_756"></span> Ne wolde nevere God bitwixe us tweyne,  
<span id="an_757"></span> As in my gilt, were outher werre or stryf.  
<span id="an_758"></span> Sire, I wol be youre humble trewe wyf --  
<span id="an_759"></span> Have heer my trouthe -- til that myn herte
breste."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> Thus been
they bothe in quiete and in reste.  
<span id="an_761"></span> For o thyng, sires, saufly dar I seye,  
<span id="an_762"></span> That freendes everych oother moot obeye,  
<span id="an_763"></span> If they wol longe holden compaignye.  
<span id="an_764"></span> Love wol nat been constreyned by maistrye.  
<span id="an_765"></span> Whan maistrie comth, the God of Love anon  
<span id="an_766"></span> Beteth his wynges, and farewel, he is gon!  
<span id="an_767"></span> Love is a thyng as any spirit free.  
<span id="an_768"></span> Wommen, of kynde, desiren libertee,  
<span id="an_769"></span> And nat to been constreyned as a thral;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> And so doon
men, if I sooth seyen shal.  
<span id="an_771"></span> Looke who that is moost pacient in love,  
<span id="an_772"></span> He is at his avantage al above.  
<span id="an_773"></span> Pacience is an heigh vertu, certeyn,  
<span id="an_774"></span> For it venquysseth, as thise clerkes seyn,  
<span id="an_775"></span> Thynges that rigour sholde nevere atteyne.  
<span id="an_776"></span> For every word men may nat chide or pleyne.  
<span id="an_777"></span> Lerneth to suffre, or elles, so moot I goon,  
<span id="an_778"></span> Ye shul it lerne, wher so ye wole or noon;  
<span id="an_779"></span> For in this world, certein, ther no wight is  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_780">780</span></span> That he ne
dooth or seith somtyme amys.  
<span id="an_781"></span> Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun,  
<span id="an_782"></span> Wyn, wo, or chaungynge of complexioun  
<span id="an_783"></span> Causeth ful ofte to doon amys or speken.  
<span id="an_784"></span> On every wrong a man may nat be wreken.  
<span id="an_785"></span> After the tyme moste be temperaunce  
<span id="an_786"></span> To every wight that kan on governaunce.  
<span id="an_787"></span> And therfore hath this wise, worthy knyght,  
<span id="an_788"></span> To lyve in ese, suffrance hire bihight,  
<span id="an_789"></span> And she to hym ful wisly gan to swere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_790">790</span></span> That nevere
sholde ther be defaute in here.  
<span id="an_791"></span> Heere may men seen an humble, wys accord;  
<span id="an_792"></span> Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord
--  
<span id="an_793"></span> Servant in love, and lord in mariage.  
<span id="an_794"></span> Thanne was he bothe in lordshipe and
servage.  
<span id="an_795"></span> Servage? Nay, but in lordshipe above,  
<span id="an_796"></span> Sith he hath bothe his lady and his love;  
<span id="an_797"></span> His lady, certes, and his wyf also,  
<span id="an_798"></span> The which that lawe of love acordeth to.  
<span id="an_799"></span> And whan he was in this prosperitee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800">800</span></span> Hoom with his
wyf he gooth to his contree,  
<span id="an_801"></span> Nat fer fro Pedmark, ther his dwellyng was,  
<span id="an_802"></span> Where as he lyveth in blisse and in solas.  
<span id="an_803"></span> Who koude telle, but he hadde wedded be,  
<span id="an_804"></span> The joye, the ese, and the prosperitee  
<span id="an_805"></span> That is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf?  
<span id="an_806"></span> A yeer and moore lasted this blisful lyf,  
<span id="an_807"></span> Til that the knyght of which I speke of
thus,  
<span id="an_808"></span> That of Kayrrud was cleped Arveragus,  
<span id="an_809"></span> Shoop hym to goon and dwelle a yeer or
tweyne  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> In Engelond,
that cleped was eek Briteyne,  
<span id="an_811"></span> To seke in armes worshipe and honour --  
<span id="an_812"></span> For al his lust he sette in swich labour --  
<span id="an_813"></span> And dwelled there two yeer; the book seith
thus.  
<span id="an_814"></span> Now wol I stynten of this Arveragus,  
<span id="an_815"></span> And speken I wole of Dorigen his wyf,  
<span id="an_816"></span> That loveth hire housbonde as hire hertes
lyf.  
<span id="an_817"></span> For his absence wepeth she and siketh,  
<span id="an_818"></span> As doon thise noble wyves whan hem liketh.  
<span id="an_819"></span> She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth,
pleyneth;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820">820</span></span> Desir of his
presence hire so destreyneth  
<span id="an_821"></span> That al this wyde world she sette at noght.  
<span id="an_822"></span> Hire freendes, whiche that knewe hir hevy
thoght,  
<span id="an_823"></span> Conforten hire in al that ever they may.  
<span id="an_824"></span> They prechen hire, they telle hire nyght and
day  
<span id="an_825"></span> That causelees she sleeth hirself, allas!  
<span id="an_826"></span> And every confort possible in this cas  
<span id="an_827"></span> They doon to hire with al hire bisynesse,  
<span id="an_828"></span> Al for to make hire leve hire hevynesse.  
<span id="an_829"></span> By proces, as ye knowen everichoon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_830">830</span></span> Men may so
longe graven in a stoon  
<span id="an_831"></span> Til som figure therinne emprented be.  
<span id="an_832"></span> So longe han they conforted hire til she  
<span id="an_833"></span> Receyved hath, by hope and by resoun,  
<span id="an_834"></span> The emprentyng of hire consolacioun,  
<span id="an_835"></span> Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;  
<span id="an_836"></span> She may nat alwey duren in swich rage.  
<span id="an_837"></span> And eek Arveragus, in al this care,  
<span id="an_838"></span> Hath sent hire lettres hoom of his welfare,  
<span id="an_839"></span> And that he wol come hastily agayn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_840">840</span></span> Or elles
hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn.  
<span id="an_841"></span> Hire freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake  
<span id="an_842"></span> And preyde hire on knees, for Goddes sake,  
<span id="an_843"></span> To come and romen hire in compaignye,  
<span id="an_844"></span> Awey to dryve hire derke fantasye.  
<span id="an_845"></span> And finally she graunted that requeste,  
<span id="an_846"></span> For wel she saugh that it was for the beste.  
<span id="an_847"></span> Now stood hire castel faste by the see,  
<span id="an_848"></span> And often with hire freendes walketh shee  
<span id="an_849"></span> Hire to disporte upon the bank an heigh,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_850">850</span></span> Where as she
many a ship and barge seigh  
<span id="an_851"></span> Seillynge hir cours, where as hem liste go.  
<span id="an_852"></span> But thanne was that a parcel of hire wo,  
<span id="an_853"></span> For to hirself ful ofte, "Allas!" seith she,  
<span id="an_854"></span> "Is ther no ship, of so manye as I se,  
<span id="an_855"></span> Wol bryngen hom my lord? Thanne were myn
herte  
<span id="an_856"></span> Al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte."  
<span id="an_857"></span> Another tyme ther wolde she sitte and
thynke,  
<span id="an_858"></span> And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brynke.  
<span id="an_859"></span> But whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860">860</span></span> For verray
feere so wolde hir herte quake  
<span id="an_861"></span> That on hire feet she myghte hire noght
sustene.  
<span id="an_862"></span> Thanne wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,  
<span id="an_863"></span> And pitously into the see biholde,  
<span id="an_864"></span> And seyn right thus, with sorweful sikes
colde:  
<span id="an_865"></span> "Eterne God, that thurgh thy purveiaunce  
<span id="an_866"></span> Ledest the world by certein governaunce,  
<span id="an_867"></span> In ydel, as men seyn, ye no thyng make.  
<span id="an_868"></span> But, Lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes
blake,  
<span id="an_869"></span> That semen rather a foul confusion  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870">870</span></span> Of werk than
any fair creacion  
<span id="an_871"></span> Of swich a parfit wys God and a stable,  
<span id="an_872"></span> Why han ye wroght this werk unresonable?  
<span id="an_873"></span> For by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne
eest,  
<span id="an_874"></span> Ther nys yfostred man, ne bryd, ne beest;  
<span id="an_875"></span> It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth.  
<span id="an_876"></span> Se ye nat, Lord, how mankynde it destroyeth?  
<span id="an_877"></span> An hundred thousand bodyes of mankynde  
<span id="an_878"></span> Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in mynde,  
<span id="an_879"></span> Which mankynde is so fair part of thy werk  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> That thou it
madest lyk to thyn owene merk.  
<span id="an_881"></span> Thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee  
<span id="an_882"></span> Toward mankynde; but how thanne may it bee  
<span id="an_883"></span> That ye swiche meenes make it to destroyen,  
<span id="an_884"></span> Whiche meenes do no good, but evere anoyen?  
<span id="an_885"></span> I woot wel clerkes wol seyn as hem leste,  
<span id="an_886"></span> By argumentz, that al is for the beste,  
<span id="an_887"></span> Though I ne kan the causes nat yknowe.  
<span id="an_888"></span> But thilke God that made wynd to blowe  
<span id="an_889"></span> As kepe my lord! This my conclusion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_890">890</span></span> To clerkes
lete I al disputison.  
<span id="an_891"></span> But wolde God that alle thise rokkes blake  
<span id="an_892"></span> Were sonken into helle for his sake!  
<span id="an_893"></span> Thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the feere."  
<span id="an_894"></span> Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous
teere.  
<span id="an_895"></span> Hire freendes sawe that it was no disport  
<span id="an_896"></span> To romen by the see, but disconfort,  
<span id="an_897"></span> And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles.  
<span id="an_898"></span> They leden hire by ryveres and by welles,  
<span id="an_899"></span> And eek in othere places delitables;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900">900</span></span> They dauncen
and they pleyen at ches and tables.  
<span id="an_901"></span> So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde,  
<span id="an_902"></span> Unto a gardyn that was ther bisyde,  
<span id="an_903"></span> In which that they hadde maad hir ordinaunce  
<span id="an_904"></span> Of vitaille and of oother purveiaunce,  
<span id="an_905"></span> They goon and pleye hem al the longe day.  
<span id="an_906"></span> And this was on the sixte morwe of May,  
<span id="an_907"></span> Which May hadde peynted with his softe
shoures  
<span id="an_908"></span> This gardyn ful of leves and of floures;  
<span id="an_909"></span> And craft of mannes hand so curiously  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_910">910</span></span> Arrayed hadde
this gardyn, trewely,  
<span id="an_911"></span> That nevere was ther gardyn of swich prys  
<span id="an_912"></span> But if it were the verray paradys.  
<span id="an_913"></span> The odour of floures and the fresshe sighte  
<span id="an_914"></span> Wolde han maked any herte lighte  
<span id="an_915"></span> That evere was born, but if to greet
siknesse  
<span id="an_916"></span> Or to greet sorwe helde it in distresse,  
<span id="an_917"></span> So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce.  
<span id="an_918"></span> At after-dyner gonne they to daunce,  
<span id="an_919"></span> And synge also, save Dorigen allone,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920">920</span></span> Which made
alwey hir compleint and hir moone,  
<span id="an_921"></span> For she ne saugh hym on the daunce go  
<span id="an_922"></span> That was hir housbonde and hir love also.  
<span id="an_923"></span> But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde  
<span id="an_924"></span> And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.  
<span id="an_925"></span> Upon this daunce, amonges othere men,  
<span id="an_926"></span> Daunced a squier biforn Dorigen,  
<span id="an_927"></span> That fressher was and jolyer of array,  
<span id="an_928"></span> As to my doom, than is the month of May.  
<span id="an_929"></span> He syngeth, daunceth, passynge any man  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> That is, or
was, sith that the world bigan.  
<span id="an_931"></span> Therwith he was, if men sholde hym discryve,  
<span id="an_932"></span> Oon of the beste farynge man on lyve;  
<span id="an_933"></span> Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche, and
wys,  
<span id="an_934"></span> And wel biloved, and holden in greet prys.  
<span id="an_935"></span> And shortly, if the sothe I tellen shal,  
<span id="an_936"></span> Unwityng of this Dorigen at al,  
<span id="an_937"></span> This lusty squier, servant to Venus,  
<span id="an_938"></span> Which that ycleped was Aurelius,  
<span id="an_939"></span> Hadde loved hire best of any creature  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> Two yeer and
moore, as was his aventure,  
<span id="an_941"></span> But nevere dorste he tellen hire his
grevaunce.  
<span id="an_942"></span> Withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce.  
<span id="an_943"></span> He was despeyred; no thyng dorste he seye,  
<span id="an_944"></span> Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye  
<span id="an_945"></span> His wo, as in a general compleynyng;  
<span id="an_946"></span> He seyde he lovede and was biloved no thyng.  
<span id="an_947"></span> Of swich matere made he manye layes,  
<span id="an_948"></span> Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,  
<span id="an_949"></span> How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> But
langwissheth as a furye dooth in helle;  
<span id="an_951"></span> And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko  
<span id="an_952"></span> For Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hir wo.  
<span id="an_953"></span> In oother manere than ye heere me seye,  
<span id="an_954"></span> Ne dorste he nat to hire his wo biwreye,  
<span id="an_955"></span> Save that, paraventure, somtyme at daunces,  
<span id="an_956"></span> Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces,  
<span id="an_957"></span> It may wel be he looked on hir face  
<span id="an_958"></span> In swich a wise as man that asketh grace;  
<span id="an_959"></span> But nothyng wiste she of his entente.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_960">960</span></span> Nathelees it
happed, er they thennes wente,  
<span id="an_961"></span> By cause that he was hire neighebour,  
<span id="an_962"></span> And was a man of worshipe and honour,  
<span id="an_963"></span> And hadde yknowen hym of tyme yoore,  
<span id="an_964"></span> They fille in speche; and forth, moore and
moore,  
<span id="an_965"></span> Unto his purpos drough Aurelius,  
<span id="an_966"></span> And whan he saugh his tyme, he seyde thus:  
<span id="an_967"></span> "Madame," quod he, "by God that this world
made,  
<span id="an_968"></span> So that I wiste it myghte youre herte glade,  
<span id="an_969"></span> I wolde that day that youre Arveragus  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> Wente over
the see, that I, Aurelius,  
<span id="an_971"></span> Hadde went ther nevere I sholde have come
agayn.  
<span id="an_972"></span> For wel I woot my servyce is in vayn;  
<span id="an_973"></span> My gerdon is but brestyng of myn herte.  
<span id="an_974"></span> Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte;  
<span id="an_975"></span> For with a word ye may me sleen or save.  
<span id="an_976"></span> Heere at youre feet God wolde that I were
grave!  
<span id="an_977"></span> I ne have as now no leyser moore to seye;  
<span id="an_978"></span> Have mercy, sweete, or ye wol do me deye!"  
<span id="an_979"></span> She gan to looke upon Aurelius;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980">980</span></span> "Is this
youre wyl," quod she, "and sey ye thus?  
<span id="an_981"></span> Nevere erst," quod she, "ne wiste I what ye
mente.  
<span id="an_982"></span> But now, Aurelie, I knowe youre entente,  
<span id="an_983"></span> By thilke God that yaf me soule and lyf,  
<span id="an_984"></span> Ne shal I nevere been untrewe wyf  
<span id="an_985"></span> In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit;  
<span id="an_986"></span> I wol been his to whom that I am knyt.  
<span id="an_987"></span> Taak this for fynal answere as of me."  
<span id="an_988"></span> But after that in pley thus seyde she:  
<span id="an_989"></span> "Aurelie," quod she, "by heighe God above,

<span id="an_999"></span> "Is ther noon oother grace in yow?" quod he.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> "No, by

<span id="an_1001"></span> For wel I woot that it shal never bityde.  
<span id="an_1002"></span> Lat swiche folies out of youre herte slyde.  
<span id="an_1003"></span> What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf

<span id="an_1006"></span> Aurelius ful ofte soore siketh;  
<span id="an_1007"></span> Wo was Aurelie whan that he this herde,  
<span id="an_1008"></span> And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:  
<span id="an_1009"></span> "Madame," quod he, "this were an

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> Thanne moot

<span id="an_1011"></span> And with that word he turned hym anon.  
<span id="an_1012"></span> Tho coome hir othere freendes many oon,  
<span id="an_1013"></span> And in the aleyes romeden up and doun,  
<span id="an_1014"></span> And nothyng wiste of this conclusioun,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> And with
that word in swowne he fil adoun,  
<span id="an_1081"></span> And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce.  
<span id="an_1082"></span> His brother, which that knew of his

<span id="an_1083"></span> Up caughte hym and to bedde he hath hym
broght.  
<span id="an_1084"></span> Dispeyred in this torment and this thoght  
<span id="an_1085"></span> Lete I this woful creature lye;  
<span id="an_1086"></span> Chese he, for me, wheither he wol lyve or
dye.  
<span id="an_1087"></span> Arveragus, with heele and greet honour,  
<span id="an_1088"></span> As he that was of chivalrie the flour,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090">1090</span></span> O blisful
artow now, thou Dorigen,  
<span id="an_1091"></span> That hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne

<span id="an_1092"></span> The fresshe knyght, the worthy man of

<span id="an_1093"></span> That loveth thee as his owene hertes lyf.  
<span id="an_1094"></span> No thyng list hym to been ymaginatyf,  
<span id="an_1095"></span> If any wight hadde spoke, whil he was oute,  
<span id="an_1096"></span> To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute.  
<span id="an_1097"></span> He noght entendeth to no swich mateere,  
<span id="an_1098"></span> But daunceth, justeth, maketh hire good
cheere;  
<span id="an_1099"></span> And thus in joye and blisse I lete hem
dwelle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100">1100</span></span> And of the
sike Aurelius wol I telle.  
<span id="an_1101"></span> In langour and in torment furyus  
<span id="an_1102"></span> Two yeer and moore lay wrecche Aurelyus,  
<span id="an_1103"></span> Er any foot he myghte on erthe gon;  
<span id="an_1104"></span> Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,  
<span id="an_1105"></span> Save of his brother, which that was a
clerk.  
<span id="an_1106"></span> He knew of al this wo and al this werk,  
<span id="an_1107"></span> For to noon oother creature, certeyn,  
<span id="an_1108"></span> Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.  
<span id="an_1109"></span> Under his brest he baar it moore secree  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1110">1110</span></span> Than evere
dide Pamphilus for Galathee.  
<span id="an_1111"></span> His brest was hool, withoute for to sene,  
<span id="an_1112"></span> But in his herte ay was the arwe kene.  
<span id="an_1113"></span> And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure  
<span id="an_1114"></span> In surgerye is perilous the cure,  
<span id="an_1115"></span> But men myghte touche the arwe or come
therby.  
<span id="an_1116"></span> His brother weep and wayled pryvely,  
<span id="an_1117"></span> Til atte laste hym fil in remembraunce,  
<span id="an_1118"></span> That whiles he was at Orliens in Fraunce --  
<span id="an_1119"></span> As yonge clerkes that been lykerous  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120">1120</span></span> To reden
artes that been curious  
<span id="an_1121"></span> Seken in every halke and every herne  
<span id="an_1122"></span> Particuler sciences for to lerne --  
<span id="an_1123"></span> He hym remembred that, upon a day,  
<span id="an_1124"></span> At Orliens in studie a book he say  
<span id="an_1125"></span> Of magyk natureel, which his felawe,  
<span id="an_1126"></span> That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe,  
<span id="an_1127"></span> Al were he ther to lerne another craft,  
<span id="an_1128"></span> Hadde prively upon his desk ylaft;  
<span id="an_1129"></span> Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1130">1130</span></span> Touchynge
the eighte and twenty mansiouns  
<span id="an_1131"></span> That longen to the moone, and swich folye  
<span id="an_1132"></span> As in oure dayes is nat worth a flye --  
<span id="an_1133"></span> For hooly chirches feith in oure bileve  
<span id="an_1134"></span> Ne suffreth noon illusioun us to greve.  
<span id="an_1135"></span> And whan this book was in his remembraunce,  
<span id="an_1136"></span> Anon for joye his herte gan to daunce,  
<span id="an_1137"></span> And to hymself he seyde pryvely:  
<span id="an_1138"></span> "My brother shal be warisshed hastily;  
<span id="an_1139"></span> For I am siker that ther be sciences  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140">1140</span></span> By whiche
men make diverse apparences,  
<span id="an_1141"></span> Swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye.  
<span id="an_1142"></span> For ofte at feestes have I wel herd seye  
<span id="an_1143"></span> That tregetours withinne an halle large  
<span id="an_1144"></span> Have maad come in a water and a barge,  
<span id="an_1145"></span> And in the halle rowen up and doun.  
<span id="an_1146"></span> Somtyme hath semed come a grym leoun;  
<span id="an_1147"></span> And somtyme floures sprynge as in a mede;  
<span id="an_1148"></span> Somtyme a vyne, and grapes white and rede;  
<span id="an_1149"></span> Somtyme a castel, al of lym and stoon;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1150">1150</span></span> And whan
hem lyked, voyded it anon.  
<span id="an_1151"></span> Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.  
<span id="an_1152"></span> "Now thanne conclude I thus: that if I
myghte  
<span id="an_1153"></span> At Orliens som oold felawe yfynde  
<span id="an_1154"></span> That hadde thise moones mansions in mynde,  
<span id="an_1155"></span> Or oother magyk natureel above,  
<span id="an_1156"></span> He sholde wel make my brother han his love.  
<span id="an_1157"></span> For with an apparence a clerk may make,  
<span id="an_1158"></span> To mannes sighte, that alle the rokkes
blake  
<span id="an_1159"></span> Of Britaigne weren yvoyded everichon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> And shippes
by the brynke comen and gon,  
<span id="an_1161"></span> And in swich forme enduren a wowke or two.  
<span id="an_1162"></span> Thanne were my brother warisshed of his wo;  
<span id="an_1163"></span> Thanne moste she nedes holden hire biheste,  
<span id="an_1164"></span> Or elles he shal shame hire atte leeste."  
<span id="an_1165"></span> What sholde I make a lenger tale of this?  
<span id="an_1166"></span> Unto his brotheres bed he comen is,  
<span id="an_1167"></span> And swich confort he yaf hym for to gon  
<span id="an_1168"></span> To Orliens that he up stirte anon,  
<span id="an_1169"></span> And on his wey forthward thanne is he fare  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1170">1170</span></span> In hope for
to been lissed of his care.  
<span id="an_1171"></span> Whan they were come almoost to that citee,  
<span id="an_1172"></span> But if it were a two furlong or thre,  
<span id="an_1173"></span> A yong clerk romynge by hymself they mette,  
<span id="an_1174"></span> Which that in Latyn thriftily hem grette,  
<span id="an_1175"></span> And after that he seyde a wonder thyng:  
<span id="an_1176"></span> "I knowe," quod he, "the cause of youre
comyng."  
<span id="an_1177"></span> And er they ferther any foote wente,  
<span id="an_1178"></span> He tolde hem al that was in hire entente.  
<span id="an_1179"></span> This Briton clerk hym asked of felawes  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1180">1180</span></span> The whiche
that he had knowe in olde dawes,  
<span id="an_1181"></span> And he answerde hym that they dede were,  
<span id="an_1182"></span> For which he weep ful ofte many a teere.  
<span id="an_1183"></span> Doun of his hors Aurelius lighte anon,  
<span id="an_1184"></span> And with this magicien forth is he gon  
<span id="an_1185"></span> Hoom to his hous, and maden hem wel at ese.  
<span id="an_1186"></span> Hem lakked no vitaille that myghte hem
plese.  
<span id="an_1187"></span> So wel arrayed hous as ther was oon  
<span id="an_1188"></span> Aurelius in his lyf saugh nevere noon.  
<span id="an_1189"></span> He shewed hym, er he wente to sopeer,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190">1190</span></span> Forestes,
parkes ful of wilde deer;  
<span id="an_1191"></span> Ther saugh he hertes with hir hornes hye,  
<span id="an_1192"></span> The gretteste that evere were seyn with ye.  
<span id="an_1193"></span> He saugh of hem an hondred slayn with
houndes,  
<span id="an_1194"></span> And somme with arwes blede of bittre
woundes.  
<span id="an_1195"></span> He saugh, whan voyded were thise wilde
deer,  
<span id="an_1196"></span> Thise fauconers upon a fair ryver,  
<span id="an_1197"></span> That with hir haukes han the heron slayn.  
<span id="an_1198"></span> Tho saugh he knyghtes justyng in a playn;  
<span id="an_1199"></span> And after this he dide hym swich plesaunce  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> That he hym
shewed his lady on a daunce,  
<span id="an_1201"></span> On which hymself he daunced, as hym
thoughte.  
<span id="an_1202"></span> And whan this maister that this magyk
wroughte  
<span id="an_1203"></span> Saugh it was tyme, he clapte his handes
two,  
<span id="an_1204"></span> And farewel! Al oure revel was ago.  
<span id="an_1205"></span> And yet remoeved they nevere out of the
hous,  
<span id="an_1206"></span> Whil they saugh al this sighte merveillous,  
<span id="an_1207"></span> But in his studie, ther as his bookes be,  
<span id="an_1208"></span> They seten stille, and no wight but they
thre.  
<span id="an_1209"></span> To hym this maister called his squier,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> And seyde
hym thus: "Is redy oure soper?  
<span id="an_1211"></span> Almoost an houre it is, I undertake,  
<span id="an_1212"></span> Sith I yow bad oure soper for to make,  
<span id="an_1213"></span> Whan that thise worthy men wenten with me  
<span id="an_1214"></span> Into my studie, ther as my bookes be."  
<span id="an_1215"></span> "Sire," quod this squier, "whan it liketh

<span id="an_1216"></span> It is al redy, though ye wol right now."  
<span id="an_1217"></span> "Go we thanne soupe," quod he, "as for the

<span id="an_1218"></span> Thise amorous folk somtyme moote han hir
reste."  
<span id="an_1219"></span> At after-soper fille they in tretee  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1220">1220</span></span> What somme
sholde this maistres gerdon be  
<span id="an_1221"></span> To remoeven alle the rokkes of Britayne,  
<span id="an_1222"></span> And eek from Gerounde to the mouth of
Sayne.  
<span id="an_1223"></span> He made it straunge, and swoor, so God hym
save,  
<span id="an_1224"></span> Lasse than a thousand pound he wolde nat
have,  
<span id="an_1225"></span> Ne gladly for that somme he wolde nat goon.  
<span id="an_1226"></span> Aurelius, with blisful herte anoon,  
<span id="an_1227"></span> Answerde thus: "Fy on a thousand pound!  
<span id="an_1228"></span> This wyde world, which that men seye is
round,  
<span id="an_1229"></span> I wolde it yeve, if I were lord of it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1230">1230</span></span> This

<span id="an_1231"></span> Ye shal be payed trewely, by my trouthe!  
<span id="an_1232"></span> But looketh now, for no necligence or

<span id="an_1233"></span> Ye tarie us heere no lenger than to-morwe."  
<span id="an_1234"></span> "Nay," quod this clerk, "have heer my feith
to borwe."  
<span id="an_1235"></span> To bedde is goon Aurelius whan hym leste,  
<span id="an_1236"></span> And wel ny al that nyght he hadde his
reste.  
<span id="an_1237"></span> What for his labour and his hope of blisse,  
<span id="an_1238"></span> His woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse.  
<span id="an_1239"></span> Upon the morwe, whan that it was day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1240">1240</span></span> To
Britaigne tooke they the righte way,  
<span id="an_1241"></span> Aurelius and this magicien bisyde,

<span id="an_1243"></span> And this was, as thise bookes me remembre,

<span id="an_1245"></span> Phebus wax old, and hewed lyk laton,  
<span id="an_1246"></span> That in his hoote declynacion

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1250">1250</span></span> The bittre

<span id="an_1252"></span> Janus sit by the fyr, with double berd,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500">1500</span></span> On Dorigen
that was so amorus,  
<span id="an_1501"></span> Of aventure happed hire to meete  
<span id="an_1502"></span> Amydde the toun, right in the quykkest
strete,  
<span id="an_1503"></span> As she was bown to goon the wey forth right  
<span id="an_1504"></span> Toward the gardyn ther as she had hight.  
<span id="an_1505"></span> And he was to the gardyn-ward also;  
<span id="an_1506"></span> For wel he spyed whan she wolde go  
<span id="an_1507"></span> Out of hir hous to any maner place.  
<span id="an_1508"></span> But thus they mette, of aventure or grace,  
<span id="an_1509"></span> And he saleweth hire with glad entente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1510">1510</span></span> And asked
of hire whiderward she wente;  
<span id="an_1511"></span> And she answerde, half as she were mad,  
<span id="an_1512"></span> "Unto the gardyn, as myn housbonde bad,  
<span id="an_1513"></span> My trouthe for to holde -- allas, allas!"  
<span id="an_1514"></span> Aurelius gan wondren on this cas,  
<span id="an_1515"></span> And in his herte hadde greet compassioun  
<span id="an_1516"></span> Of hire and of hire lamentacioun,  
<span id="an_1517"></span> And of Arveragus, the worthy knyght,  
<span id="an_1518"></span> That bad hire holden al that she had hight,  
<span id="an_1519"></span> So looth hym was his wyf sholde breke hir
trouthe;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1520">1520</span></span> And in his
herte he caughte of this greet routhe,  
<span id="an_1521"></span> Considerynge the beste on every syde,  
<span id="an_1522"></span> That fro his lust yet were hym levere abyde  
<span id="an_1523"></span> Than doon so heigh a cherlyssh
wrecchednesse  
<span id="an_1524"></span> Agayns franchise and alle gentillesse;  
<span id="an_1525"></span> For which in fewe wordes seyde he thus:  
<span id="an_1526"></span> "Madame, seyth to youre lord Arveragus  
<span id="an_1527"></span> That sith I se his grete gentillesse  
<span id="an_1528"></span> To yow, and eek I se wel youre distresse,  
<span id="an_1529"></span> That him were levere han shame (and that were
routhe)  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1530">1530</span></span> Than ye to
me sholde breke thus youre trouthe,  
<span id="an_1531"></span> I have wel levere evere to suffre wo  
<span id="an_1532"></span> Than I departe the love bitwix yow two.  
<span id="an_1533"></span> I yow relesse, madame, into youre hond  
<span id="an_1534"></span> Quyt every serement and every bond  
<span id="an_1535"></span> That ye han maad to me as heerbiforn,  
<span id="an_1536"></span> Sith thilke tyme which that ye were born.  
<span id="an_1537"></span> My trouthe I plighte, I shal yow never
repreve  
<span id="an_1538"></span> Of no biheste, and heere I take my leve,  
<span id="an_1539"></span> As of the treweste and the beste wyf  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1540">1540</span></span> That evere
yet I knew in al my lyf.  
<span id="an_1541"></span> But every wyf be war of hire biheeste!  
<span id="an_1542"></span> On Dorigen remembreth, atte leeste.  
<span id="an_1543"></span> Thus kan a squier doon a gentil dede  
<span id="an_1544"></span> As wel as kan a knyght, withouten drede."  
<span id="an_1545"></span> She thonketh hym upon hir knees al bare,  
<span id="an_1546"></span> And hoom unto hir housbonde is she fare,  
<span id="an_1547"></span> And tolde hym al, as ye han herd me sayd;  
<span id="an_1548"></span> And be ye siker, he was so weel apayd  
<span id="an_1549"></span> That it were impossible me to wryte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1550">1550</span></span> What sholde
I lenger of this cas endyte?  
<span id="an_1551"></span> Arveragus and Dorigen his wyf  
<span id="an_1552"></span> In sovereyn blisse leden forth hir lyf.  
<span id="an_1553"></span> Nevere eft ne was ther angre hem bitwene.  
<span id="an_1554"></span> He cherisseth hire as though she were a
queene,  
<span id="an_1555"></span> And she was to hym trewe for everemoore.  
<span id="an_1556"></span> Of thise two folk ye gete of me namoore.  
<span id="an_1557"></span> Aurelius, that his cost hath al forlorn,  
<span id="an_1558"></span> Curseth the tyme that evere he was born:  
<span id="an_1559"></span> "Allas!" quod he. "Allas, that I bihighte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1560">1560</span></span> Of pured
gold a thousand pound of wighte  
<span id="an_1561"></span> Unto this philosophre! How shal I do?  
<span id="an_1562"></span> I se namoore but that I am fordo.  
<span id="an_1563"></span> Myn heritage moot I nedes selle,  
<span id="an_1564"></span> And been a beggere; heere may I nat dwelle  
<span id="an_1565"></span> And shamen al my kynrede in this place,  
<span id="an_1566"></span> But I of hym may gete bettre grace.  
<span id="an_1567"></span> But nathelees, I wole of hym assaye,  
<span id="an_1568"></span> At certeyn dayes, yeer by yeer, to paye,  
<span id="an_1569"></span> And thanke hym of his grete curteisye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1570">1570</span></span> My trouthe
wol I kepe, I wol nat lye."  
<span id="an_1571"></span> With herte soor he gooth unto his cofre,  
<span id="an_1572"></span> And broghte gold unto this philosophre,  
<span id="an_1573"></span> The value of fyve hundred pound, I gesse,  
<span id="an_1574"></span> And hym bisecheth, of his gentillesse,  
<span id="an_1575"></span> To graunte hym dayes of the remenaunt;  
<span id="an_1576"></span> And seyde, "Maister, I dar wel make avaunt,  
<span id="an_1577"></span> I failled nevere of my trouthe as yit.  
<span id="an_1578"></span> For sikerly my dette shal be quyt  
<span id="an_1579"></span> Towardes yow, howevere that I fare  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> To goon
a-begged in my kirtle bare.  
<span id="an_1581"></span> But wolde ye vouche sauf, upon seuretee,  
<span id="an_1582"></span> Two yeer or thre for to respiten me,  
<span id="an_1583"></span> Thanne were I wel; for elles moot I selle  
<span id="an_1584"></span> Myn heritage; ther is namoore to telle."  
<span id="an_1585"></span> This philosophre sobrely answerde,  
<span id="an_1586"></span> And seyde thus, whan he thise wordes herde:  
<span id="an_1587"></span> "Have I nat holden covenant unto thee?"  
<span id="an_1588"></span> "Yes, certes, wel and trewely," quod he.  
<span id="an_1589"></span> "Hastow nat had thy lady as thee liketh?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1590">1590</span></span> "No, no,"
quod he, and sorwefully he siketh.  
<span id="an_1591"></span> "What was the cause? Tel me if thou kan."  
<span id="an_1592"></span> Aurelius his tale anon bigan,  
<span id="an_1593"></span> And tolde hym al, as ye han herd bifoore;  
<span id="an_1594"></span> It nedeth nat to yow reherce it moore.  
<span id="an_1595"></span> He seide, "Arveragus, of gentillesse,  
<span id="an_1596"></span> Hadde levere dye in sorwe and in distresse  
<span id="an_1597"></span> Than that his wyf were of hir trouthe
fals."  
<span id="an_1598"></span> The sorwe of Dorigen he tolde hym als;  
<span id="an_1599"></span> How looth hire was to been a wikked wyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600">1600</span></span> And that
she levere had lost that day hir lyf,  
<span id="an_1601"></span> And that hir trouthe she swoor thurgh
innocence,  
<span id="an_1602"></span> She nevere erst hadde herde speke of
apparence.  
<span id="an_1603"></span> "That made me han of hire so greet pitee;  
<span id="an_1604"></span> And right as frely as he sente hire me,  
<span id="an_1605"></span> As frely sente I hire to hym ageyn.  
<span id="an_1606"></span> This al and som; ther is namoore to seyn."  
<span id="an_1607"></span> This philosophre answerde, "Leeve brother,  
<span id="an_1608"></span> Everich of yow dide gentilly til oother.  
<span id="an_1609"></span> Thou art a squier, and he is a knyght;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1610">1610</span></span> But God
forbede, for his blisful myght,  
<span id="an_1611"></span> But if a clerk koude doon a gentil dede  
<span id="an_1612"></span> As wel as any of yow, it is no drede!  
<span id="an_1613"></span> Sire, I releesse thee thy thousand pound,  
<span id="an_1614"></span> As thou right now were cropen out of the
ground,  
<span id="an_1615"></span> Ne nevere er now ne haddest knowen me.  
<span id="an_1616"></span> For, sire, I wol nat taken a peny of thee  
<span id="an_1617"></span> For al my craft, ne noght for my travaille.  
<span id="an_1618"></span> Thou hast ypayed wel for my vitaille.  
<span id="an_1619"></span> It is ynogh, and farewel, have good day!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> And took
his hors, and forth he goth his way.  
<span id="an_1621"></span> Lordynges, this question, thanne, wol I aske
now,  
<span id="an_1622"></span> Which was the mooste fre, as thynketh yow?  
<span id="an_1623"></span> Now telleth me, er that ye ferther wende.  
<span id="an_1624"></span> I kan namoore; my tale is at an ende.
