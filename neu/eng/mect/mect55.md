### Book 3

<span id="an_1"></span> By this sche hadde ended hir song, whan the  
<span id="an_2"></span> swetnesse of here dite hadde thurw-perced me,  
<span id="an_3"></span> that was desyrous of herknynge, and I astoned  
<span id="an_4"></span> hadde yit streyghte myn eres (that is to seyn,
to  
<span id="an_5"></span> herkne the bet what sche wolde seye). So that  
<span id="an_6"></span> a litel herafter I seide thus: "O thow that
art  
<span id="an_7"></span> sovereyne confort of angwyssous corages, so  
<span id="an_8"></span> thow hast remounted and norysshed me with  
<span id="an_9"></span> the weyghte of thi sentences and with delyt  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> of thy
syngynge; so that I trowe nat  
<span id="an_11"></span> nowe that I be unparygal to the strokes of  
<span id="an_12"></span> Fortune (as who seith, I dar wel now suffren  
<span id="an_13"></span> alle the assautes of Fortune and wel defende  
<span id="an_14"></span> me fro hir). And tho remedies whiche that  
<span id="an_15"></span> thou seydest herbyforn that weren ryght  
<span id="an_16"></span> scharpe, nat oonly that I ne am nat agrisen
of  
<span id="an_17"></span> hem now, but I, desiros of herynge, axe
gretly  
<span id="an_18"></span> to heren tho remedies."  
<span id="an_19"></span> Thanne seyde sche thus: "That feeled I  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> ful wel," quod
sche, "whan that thow ententyf  
<span id="an_21"></span> and stille ravysschedest my wordes,  
<span id="an_22"></span> and I abood til that thou haddest swich
habite  
<span id="an_23"></span> of thi thought as thou hast now, or elles til
that  
<span id="an_24"></span> I myself hadde maked to the the same habite,  
<span id="an_25"></span> whiche that is a more verray thyng. And
certes  
<span id="an_26"></span> the remenant of thynges that ben yet to seie  
<span id="an_27"></span> ben swiche that first whan men tasten hem
they  
<span id="an_28"></span> ben bytynge; but whan they ben resceyved  
<span id="an_29"></span> withynne a wyght, thanne ben thei swete.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> But for thou
seyst that thow art so desyrous  
<span id="an_31"></span> to herkne hem, with how greet brennynge  
<span id="an_32"></span> woldestow glowen, yif thow wistest whider I  
<span id="an_33"></span> wol leden the!"  
<span id="an_34"></span> "Whider is that?" quod I.  
<span id="an_35"></span> "To thilke verraye welefulnesse," quod sche,  
<span id="an_36"></span> "of whiche thyn herte dremeth. but forasmoche  
<span id="an_37"></span> as thi syghte is ocupyed and destourbed by  
<span id="an_38"></span> imagynacioun of erthly thynges, thow mayst  
<span id="an_39"></span> nat yit seen thilke selve welefulnesse."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> "Do," quod I,
"and schewe me what is  
<span id="an_41"></span> thilke verray welefulnesse, I preie the,  
<span id="an_42"></span> withoute taryinge."  
<span id="an_43"></span> "That wol I gladly do," quod sche, "for the  
<span id="an_44"></span> cause of the. But I wol first marken the by  
<span id="an_45"></span> woordes, and I wol enforcen me to enforme
the,  
<span id="an_46"></span> thilke false cause of blisfulnesse that thou
more  
<span id="an_47"></span> knowest; so that whanne thow hast fully
byhoolden  
<span id="an_48"></span> thilke false goodes and torned thin  
<span id="an_49"></span> eighen to the tother syde, thow mowe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> knowe the
cleernesse of verray blisfulnesse.  
<span id="an_1"></span> "Whoso wole sowe a feld plentevous, let hym  
<span id="an_2"></span> first delyvren it of thornes, and kerve
asondir  
<span id="an_3"></span> with his hook the bussches and the feern, so  
<span id="an_4"></span> that the corn may comen hevy of erys and of  
<span id="an_5"></span> greynes. Hony is the more swete, if mouthes  
<span id="an_6"></span> han first tasted savours that ben wykke. The  
<span id="an_7"></span> sterres schynen more aggreablely whan the  
<span id="an_8"></span> wynd Nothus leteth his plowngy blastes; and  
<span id="an_9"></span> aftir that Lucifer, the day-sterre, hath  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> chased awey the
dirke nyght, the day the  
<span id="an_11"></span> fairere ledeth the rosene hors (of the  
<span id="an_12"></span> sonne). And ryght so thow, byhooldyng ferst
the  
<span id="an_13"></span> false goodes, bygyn to withdrawe thy nekke  
<span id="an_14"></span> fro the yok (of erthely affeccions); and  
<span id="an_15"></span> afterward the verray goodes schullen entren
into  
<span id="an_16"></span> thy corage."  
<span id="an_1"></span> Tho fastnede sche a litel the syghte of hir  
<span id="an_2"></span> eyen, and withdrowghe hir ryght as it were
into  
<span id="an_3"></span> the streyte seete of here thought, and bygan
to  
<span id="an_4"></span> speke ryght thus: "Alle the cures," quod sche,  
<span id="an_5"></span> "of mortel folk, whiche that travailen hem in  
<span id="an_6"></span> many manere studies, gon certes by diverse  
<span id="an_7"></span> weyes; but natheles thei enforcen hem alle to  
<span id="an_8"></span> comyn oonly to oon ende of blisfulnesse. And  
<span id="an_9"></span> blisfulnesse is swiche a good, that whoso  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> that hath geten
it, he ne may over that  
<span id="an_11"></span> nothyng more desire. And this thyng forsothe  
<span id="an_12"></span> is the soverayn good that conteneth in  
<span id="an_13"></span> hymself alle maner goodes; to the whiche
goode  
<span id="an_14"></span> if ther fayled any thyng, it myghte nat ben  
<span id="an_15"></span> sovereyn good, for thanne wer ther som good  
<span id="an_16"></span> out of thilke sovereyn good, that myghte ben  
<span id="an_17"></span> desired. Now is it cleer and certeyne thanne,  
<span id="an_18"></span> that blisfulnesse is a parfyt estat by the
congregacioun  
<span id="an_19"></span> of alle goodes; the whiche blisfulnesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> as I have seyd,
alle mortel folk enforcen  
<span id="an_21"></span> hem to geten by diverse weyes.  
<span id="an_22"></span> Forwhy the covetise of verray good is
naturely  
<span id="an_23"></span> iplauntyd in the hertes of men, but the
myswandrynge  
<span id="an_24"></span> errour mysledeth hem into false  
<span id="an_25"></span> goodes. Of the whiche men, some of hem  
<span id="an_26"></span> wenen that sovereyn good be to lyven withoute  
<span id="an_27"></span> nede of any thyng, and travaylen hem to ben  
<span id="an_28"></span> habundaunt of rychesses. And some othere  
<span id="an_29"></span> men demen that sovereyn good be for to be  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> ryght digne of
reverence, and enforcen  
<span id="an_31"></span> hem to ben reverenced among hir neyghbours  
<span id="an_32"></span> by the honours that thei han igeten. And  
<span id="an_33"></span> some folk ther ben that holden that ryght
heye  
<span id="an_34"></span> power be sovereyn good, and enforcen hem for  
<span id="an_35"></span> to reignen or elles to joygnen hem to hem
that  
<span id="an_36"></span> reignen. And it semeth to some other folk,
that  
<span id="an_37"></span> noblesse of renoun be the sovereyn good, and  
<span id="an_38"></span> hasten hem to geten hem gloryouse name by the  
<span id="an_39"></span> artz of werre or of pees. And many folk  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> mesuren and
gessen that the sovereyne  
<span id="an_41"></span> good be joye and gladnesse, and wenen  
<span id="an_42"></span> that it be ryght blisful thyng to plowngen
hem  
<span id="an_43"></span> in voluptuous delyt. And ther ben folk that  
<span id="an_44"></span> entrechaungen the causes and the endes of  
<span id="an_45"></span> thyse forseyde goodes, as they that desiren  
<span id="an_46"></span> rychesses to han power and delitz, or elles
they  
<span id="an_47"></span> desiren power for to have moneye or for cause  
<span id="an_48"></span> of renoun. In thise thynges and in swiche
other  
<span id="an_49"></span> thynges is torned al the entencioun of
desyrynges  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> and werkes of
men; as thus:  
<span id="an_51"></span> noblesse and favour of peple, whiche that  
<span id="an_52"></span> yyveth to men, as it semeth hem, a maner  
<span id="an_53"></span> cleernesse of renoun; and wyf and children,  
<span id="an_54"></span> that men desiren for cause of delyt and
myrynesse.  
<span id="an_55"></span> But forsothe freendes ne schulde nat ben  
<span id="an_56"></span> rekned among the goodes of fortune, but of  
<span id="an_57"></span> vertu, for it is a ful hooly maner thyng;
alle  
<span id="an_58"></span> thise othere thinges forsothe ben taken for  
<span id="an_59"></span> cause of power or elles for cause of delyt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> Certes now am I
redy to referren the  
<span id="an_61"></span> goodes of the body to thise forseide thynges  
<span id="an_62"></span> aboven; for it semeth that strengthe and
gretnesse  
<span id="an_63"></span> of body yyven power and worthynesse,  
<span id="an_64"></span> and that beaute and swyftnesse yyven noblesse  
<span id="an_65"></span> and glorie of renoun; and heele of body
semeth  
<span id="an_66"></span> yyven delyt. In alle thise thynges it semeth  
<span id="an_67"></span> oonly that blisfulnesse is desyred; forwhy
thilk  
<span id="an_68"></span> thing that every man desireth moost over alle  
<span id="an_69"></span> thynges he demeth that it be the sovereyn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> good; but I
have diffyned that blisfulnesse  
<span id="an_71"></span> is the sovereyn good; for whiche every  
<span id="an_72"></span> wyght demeth that thilke estat that he
desireth  
<span id="an_73"></span> over alle thynges, that it be blisfulnesse.  
<span id="an_74"></span> "Now hastow thanne byforn thyne eien almest  
<span id="an_75"></span> al the purposede forme of the welefulnesse  
<span id="an_76"></span> of mankynde: that is to seyn rychesses,  
<span id="an_77"></span> honours, power, glorie, and delitz. The
whiche  
<span id="an_78"></span> delit oonly considered Epicurus, and juggid  
<span id="an_79"></span> and establissyde that delyt is the soverayn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> good, for as
moche as alle othere thynges,  
<span id="an_81"></span> as hym thoughte, byrefte awey joye and  
<span id="an_82"></span> myrthe from the herte. But I retorne ayen to  
<span id="an_83"></span> the studies of men, of whiche men the corage  
<span id="an_84"></span> alwey reherceth and seketh the sovereyne
good,  
<span id="an_85"></span> al be it so that it be with a dyrkyd memorie;  
<span id="an_86"></span> but he not by whiche path, ryght as a dronke  
<span id="an_87"></span> man not nat by whiche path he may retourne  
<span id="an_88"></span> hom to his hous. Semeth it thanne that folk  
<span id="an_89"></span> foleyen and erren, that enforcen hem to  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> have nede of
nothyng? Certes ther nys  
<span id="an_91"></span> noon other thyng that mai so wel performe  
<span id="an_92"></span> blisfulnesse, as an estat plentevous of alle
godes,  
<span id="an_93"></span> that ne hath nede of noon other thyng, but  
<span id="an_94"></span> that it is suffisant of hymself unto hymself.  
<span id="an_95"></span> And foleyen swiche folk, thanne, that wenen  
<span id="an_96"></span> that thilk thyng that is ryght good, that it
be  
<span id="an_97"></span> eek ryght worthy of honour and of reverence?  
<span id="an_98"></span> Certes, nay. For that thyng nis neither foul
ne  
<span id="an_99"></span> worthy to ben despysed that wel neyghe al  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> the

<span id="an_101"></span> for to geten it. And power, aughte nat that  
<span id="an_102"></span> ek to ben rekned amonge goodes? What elles?  
<span id="an_103"></span> For it nys nat to wene that thilke thyng that
is  
<span id="an_104"></span> most worthy of alle thynges be feble and  
<span id="an_105"></span> withoute strengthe. And cleernesse of
renoun,  
<span id="an_106"></span> aughte that to ben despysed? Certes ther may
no  
<span id="an_107"></span> man forsake, that alle thyng that is right  
<span id="an_108"></span> excellent and noble, that it ne semeth to
ben  
<span id="an_109"></span> ryght cleer and renomed. For certes it  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> nedeth nat to
saie that blisfulnesse be  
<span id="an_111"></span> \[n'\] \[angwyssous\] ne drery, ne subgit to  
<span id="an_112"></span> grevaunces ne to sorwes; syn that in ryght
litele  
<span id="an_113"></span> thynges folk seken to haven and to usen that
may  
<span id="an_114"></span> delyten hem. Certes thise ben the thinges
that  
<span id="an_115"></span> men wolen and desiren to geten, and for this  
<span id="an_116"></span> cause desiren they rychesses, dignytes,
reignes,  
<span id="an_117"></span> glorie, and delices; for therby wenen they
to  
<span id="an_118"></span> han suffysaunce, honour, power, renoun, and  
<span id="an_119"></span> gladnesse. Thanne is it good that men  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> seken thus,
by so manye diverse studies; in  
<span id="an_121"></span> whiche desir it mai lyghtly be schewyd how  
<span id="an_122"></span> greet is the strengthe of nature. For how so
that  
<span id="an_123"></span> men han diverse sentences and discordynge,  
<span id="an_124"></span> algates men accorden alle in lovynge the
eende  
<span id="an_125"></span> of good.  
<span id="an_1"></span> "It liketh me to schewe by subtil soong, with  
<span id="an_2"></span> slakke and delytable sown of strenges, how  
<span id="an_3"></span> that Nature, myghty, enclyneth and flytteth

<span id="an_6"></span> how sche, byndynge, restreyneth alle thynges

<span id="an_27"></span> by infortune.  
<span id="an_1"></span> "Every delit hath this, that it angwisscheth

<span id="an_1"></span> "Now is it no doute thanne that thise weyes

<span id="an_38"></span> "Certes it es more flyttynge than the

<span id="an_16"></span> alle thinges ne mighten nat asswagen hir lord  
<span id="an_17"></span> Orpheus, he pleynid hym of the hevene  
<span id="an_18"></span> goddis that weren cruel to hym.  
<span id="an_19"></span> "He wente hym to the houses of helle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> and ther he
tempride his blaundysschinge

<span id="an_23"></span> resceyved and lavyd out of the noble welles
of  
<span id="an_24"></span> his modir Callyope the goddesse. And he sang  
<span id="an_25"></span> with as mochel as he myghte of wepynge, and  
<span id="an_26"></span> with as moche as love that doublide his sorwe  
<span id="an_27"></span> myghte yeve hym and teche hym, and he

felonyes,  
<span id="an_35"></span> that tormenten and agasten the soules by
anoy,  
<span id="an_36"></span> woxen sorweful and sory, and wepyn teeris for  
<span id="an_37"></span> pite. Tho was nat the heved of Yxion
ytormented  
<span id="an_38"></span> by the overthrowynge wheel. And Tantalus,
that  
<span id="an_39"></span> was destroied by the woodnesse of long

<span id="an_41"></span> The foul that highte voltor, that etith the  
<span id="an_42"></span> stomak or the gyser of Tycius, is so fulfild
of

the

<span id="an_59"></span> and lost hire, and was deed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> "This fable
apertenith to yow alle, whosoevere
