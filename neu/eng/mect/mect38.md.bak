#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Nun's Priest's Tale

<span id="an_2821"></span> A povre wydwe, somdeel stape in age,  
<span id="an_2822"></span> Was whilom dwellyng in a narwe cotage,  
<span id="an_2823"></span> Biside a grove, stondynge in a dale.  
<span id="an_2824"></span> This wydwe, of which I telle yow my tale,  
<span id="an_2825"></span> Syn thilke day that she was last a wyf  
<span id="an_2826"></span> In pacience ladde a ful symple lyf,  
<span id="an_2827"></span> For litel was hir catel and hir rente.  
<span id="an_2828"></span> By housbondrie of swich as God hire sente  
<span id="an_2829"></span> She foond hirself and eek hir doghtren two.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2830">2830</span></span> Thre large
sowes hadde she, and namo,  
<span id="an_2831"></span> Three keen, and eek a sheep that highte
Malle.  
<span id="an_2832"></span> Ful sooty was hire bour and eek hir halle,  
<span id="an_2833"></span> In which she eet ful many a sklendre meel.  
<span id="an_2834"></span> Of poynaunt sauce hir neded never a deel.  
<span id="an_2835"></span> No deyntee morsel passed thurgh hir throte;  
<span id="an_2836"></span> Hir diete was accordant to hir cote.  
<span id="an_2837"></span> Repleccioun ne made hire nevere sik;  
<span id="an_2838"></span> Attempree diete was al hir phisik,  
<span id="an_2839"></span> And exercise, and hertes suffisaunce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2840">2840</span></span> The goute
lette hire nothyng for to daunce,  
<span id="an_2841"></span> N' apoplexie shente nat hir heed.  
<span id="an_2842"></span> No wyn ne drank she, neither whit ne reed;  
<span id="an_2843"></span> Hir bord was served moost with whit and blak
--  
<span id="an_2844"></span> Milk and broun breed, in which she foond no
lak,  
<span id="an_2845"></span> Seynd bacoun, and somtyme an ey or tweye,  
<span id="an_2846"></span> For she was, as it were, a maner deye.  
<span id="an_2847"></span> A yeerd she hadde, enclosed al aboute  
<span id="an_2848"></span> With stikkes, and a drye dych withoute,  
<span id="an_2849"></span> In which she hadde a cok, hight
Chauntecleer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2850">2850</span></span> In al the
land, of crowyng nas his peer.  
<span id="an_2851"></span> His voys was murier than the murie orgon  
<span id="an_2852"></span> On messe-dayes that in the chirche gon.  
<span id="an_2853"></span> Wel sikerer was his crowyng in his logge  
<span id="an_2854"></span> Than is a clokke or an abbey orlogge.  
<span id="an_2855"></span> By nature he knew ech ascencioun  
<span id="an_2856"></span> Of the equynoxial in thilke toun;  
<span id="an_2857"></span> For whan degrees fiftene weren ascended,  
<span id="an_2858"></span> Thanne crew he that it myghte nat been
amended.  
<span id="an_2859"></span> His coomb was redder than the fyn coral,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2860">2860</span></span> And
batailled as it were a castel wal;  
<span id="an_2861"></span> His byle was blak, and as the jeet it
shoon;  
<span id="an_2862"></span> Lyk asure were his legges and his toon;  
<span id="an_2863"></span> His nayles whitter than the lylye flour,  
<span id="an_2864"></span> And lyk the burned gold was his colour.  
<span id="an_2865"></span> This gentil cok hadde in his governaunce  
<span id="an_2866"></span> Sevene hennes for to doon al his plesaunce,  
<span id="an_2867"></span> Whiche were his sustres and his paramours,  
<span id="an_2868"></span> And wonder lyk to hym, as of colours;  
<span id="an_2869"></span> Of whiche the faireste hewed on hir throte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2870">2870</span></span> Was cleped
faire damoysele Pertelote.  
<span id="an_2871"></span> Curteys she was, discreet, and debonaire,  
<span id="an_2872"></span> And compaignable, and bar hyrself so faire  
<span id="an_2873"></span> Syn thilke day that she was seven nyght
oold  
<span id="an_2874"></span> That trewely she hath the herte in hoold  
<span id="an_2875"></span> Of Chauntecleer, loken in every lith;  
<span id="an_2876"></span> He loved hire so that wel was hym therwith.  
<span id="an_2877"></span> But swich a joye was it to here hem synge,  
<span id="an_2878"></span> Whan that the brighte sonne gan to sprynge,  
<span id="an_2879"></span> In sweete accord, "My lief is faren in
londe!" --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2880">2880</span></span> For thilke
tyme, as I have understonde,  
<span id="an_2881"></span> Beestes and briddes koude speke and synge.  
<span id="an_2882"></span> And so bifel that in a dawenynge,  
<span id="an_2883"></span> As Chauntecleer among his wyves alle  
<span id="an_2884"></span> Sat on his perche, that was in the halle,  
<span id="an_2885"></span> And next hym sat this faire Pertelote,  
<span id="an_2886"></span> This Chauntecleer gan gronen in his throte,  
<span id="an_2887"></span> As man that in his dreem is drecched soore.  
<span id="an_2888"></span> And whan that Pertelote thus herde hym
roore,  
<span id="an_2889"></span> She was agast and seyde, "Herte deere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2890">2890</span></span> What eyleth

<span id="an_2891"></span> Ye been a verray sleper; fy, for shame!"  
<span id="an_2892"></span> And he answerde, and seyde thus: "Madame,  
<span id="an_2893"></span> I pray yow that ye take it nat agrief.  
<span id="an_2894"></span> By God, me mette I was in swich meschief  
<span id="an_2895"></span> Right now that yet myn herte is soore

<span id="an_2896"></span> Now God," quod he, "my swevene recche

<span id="an_2898"></span> Me mette how that I romed up and doun  
<span id="an_2899"></span> Withinne our yeerd, wheer as I saugh a

<span id="an_2901"></span> Upon my body, and wolde han had me deed.  
<span id="an_2902"></span> His colour was bitwixe yelow and reed,  
<span id="an_2903"></span> And tipped was his tayl and bothe his eeris  
<span id="an_2904"></span> With blak, unlyk the remenant of his

<span id="an_2905"></span> His snowte smal, with glowynge eyen tweye.  
<span id="an_2906"></span> Yet of his look for feere almoost I deye;

<span id="an_2908"></span> "Avoy!" quod she, "fy on yow, hertelees!  
<span id="an_2909"></span> Allas," quod she, "for, by that God above,

<span id="an_2996"></span> That oon of hem was logged in a stalle,

<span id="an_3078"></span> Hym mette a wonder dreem agayn the day.  
<span id="an_3079"></span> Hym thoughte a man stood by his beddes
syde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3080">3080</span></span> And hym
comanded that he sholde abyde,  
<span id="an_3081"></span> And seyde hym thus: \`If thou tomorwe
wende,  
<span id="an_3082"></span> Thow shalt be dreynt; my tale is at an

<span id="an_3083"></span> He wook, and tolde his felawe what he

<span id="an_3084"></span> And preyde hym his viage for to lette;  
<span id="an_3085"></span> As for that day, he preyde hym to byde.  
<span id="an_3086"></span> His felawe, that lay by his beddes syde,  
<span id="an_3087"></span> Gan for to laughe, and scorned him ful
faste.  
<span id="an_3088"></span> \`No dreem,' quod he, \`may so myn herte

<span id="an_3177"></span> He fethered Pertelote twenty tyme,

<span id="an_3234"></span> But what that God forwoot moot nedes bee,  
<span id="an_3235"></span> After the opinioun of certein clerkis.  
<span id="an_3236"></span> Witnesse on hym that any parfit clerk is,

<span id="an_3263"></span> Rede auctours, where they trete of swich

<span id="an_3272"></span> How that they syngen wel and myrily).  
<span id="an_3273"></span> And so bifel that, as he caste his ye  
<span id="an_3274"></span> Among the wortes on a boterflye,  
<span id="an_3275"></span> He was war of this fox, that lay ful lowe.  
<span id="an_3276"></span> Nothyng ne liste hym thanne for to crowe,  
<span id="an_3277"></span> But cride anon, "Cok! cok!" and up he

<span id="an_3278"></span> As man that was affrayed in his herte.  
<span id="an_3279"></span> For natureelly a beest desireth flee  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3280">3280</span></span> Fro his

<span id="an_3285"></span> Be ye affrayed of me that am youre freend?  
<span id="an_3286"></span> Now, certes, I were worse than a feend,

<span id="an_3303"></span> Certes, it was of herte, al that he song.  
<span id="an_3304"></span> And for to make his voys the moore strong,  
<span id="an_3305"></span> He wolde so peyne hym that with bothe his

<span id="an_3324"></span> So was he ravysshed with his flaterie.  
<span id="an_3325"></span> Allas, ye lordes, many a fals flatour

<span id="an_3329"></span> Redeth Ecclesiaste of flaterye;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3330">3330</span></span> Beth war,

<span id="an_3331"></span> This Chauntecleer stood hye upon his toos,  
<span id="an_3332"></span> Strecchynge his nekke, and heeld his eyen
cloos,  
<span id="an_3333"></span> And gan to crowe loude for the nones.  
<span id="an_3334"></span> And daun Russell the fox stirte up atones,  
<span id="an_3335"></span> And by the gargat hente Chauntecleer,  
<span id="an_3336"></span> And on his bak toward the wode hym beer,  
<span id="an_3337"></span> For yet ne was ther no man that hym sewed.  
<span id="an_3338"></span> O destinee, that mayst nat been eschewed!  
<span id="an_3339"></span> Allas, that Chauntecleer fleigh fro the

<span id="an_3341"></span> And on a Friday fil al this meschaunce.  
<span id="an_3342"></span> O Venus, that art goddesse of plesaunce,  
<span id="an_3343"></span> Syn that thy servant was this Chauntecleer,  
<span id="an_3344"></span> And in thy servyce dide al his poweer,  
<span id="an_3345"></span> Moore for delit than world to multiplye,  
<span id="an_3346"></span> Why woldestow suffre hym on thy day to dye?  
<span id="an_3347"></span> O Gaufred, deere maister soverayn,  
<span id="an_3348"></span> That whan thy worthy kyng Richard was slayn  
<span id="an_3349"></span> With shot, compleynedest his deeth so

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3350">3350</span></span> Why ne

<span id="an_3351"></span> The Friday for to chide, as diden ye?  
<span id="an_3352"></span> For on a Friday, soothly, slayn was he.  
<span id="an_3353"></span> Thanne wolde I shewe yow how that I koude
pleyne  
<span id="an_3354"></span> For Chauntecleres drede and for his peyne.  
<span id="an_3355"></span> Certes, swich cry ne lamentacion  
<span id="an_3356"></span> Was nevere of ladyes maad whan Ylion  
<span id="an_3357"></span> Was wonne, and Pirrus with his streite
swerd,  
<span id="an_3358"></span> Whan he hadde hent kyng Priam by the berd,  
<span id="an_3359"></span> And slayn hym, as seith us Eneydos,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3360">3360</span></span> As maden
alle the hennes in the clos,  
<span id="an_3361"></span> Whan they had seyn of Chauntecleer the
sighte.  
<span id="an_3362"></span> But sovereynly dame Pertelote shrighte  
<span id="an_3363"></span> Ful louder than dide Hasdrubales wyf,  
<span id="an_3364"></span> Whan that hir housbonde hadde lost his lyf  
<span id="an_3365"></span> And that the Romayns hadde brend Cartage.  
<span id="an_3366"></span> She was so ful of torment and of rage  
<span id="an_3367"></span> That wilfully into the fyr she sterte  
<span id="an_3368"></span> And brende hirselven with a stedefast
herte.  
<span id="an_3369"></span> O woful hennes, right so criden ye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3370">3370</span></span> As whan

<span id="an_3371"></span> Of Rome cryden senatoures wyves  
<span id="an_3372"></span> For that hir husbondes losten alle hir lyves

<span id="an_3373"></span> Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slayn.  
<span id="an_3374"></span> Now wole I turne to my tale agayn.

<span id="an_3379"></span> And bar upon his bak the cok away,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3380">3380</span></span> And cryden,
"Out! Harrow and weylaway!  
<span id="an_3381"></span> Ha, ha! The fox!" and after hym they ran,  
<span id="an_3382"></span> And eek with staves many another man.  
<span id="an_3383"></span> Ran Colle oure dogge, and Talbot and
Gerland,  
<span id="an_3384"></span> And Malkyn, with a dystaf in hir hand;  
<span id="an_3385"></span> Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray
hogges,  
<span id="an_3386"></span> So fered for the berkyng of the dogges  
<span id="an_3387"></span> And shoutyng of the men and wommen eeke  
<span id="an_3388"></span> They ronne so hem thoughte hir herte

<span id="an_3389"></span> They yolleden as feendes doon in helle;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3390">3390</span></span> The dokes
cryden as men wolde hem quelle;  
<span id="an_3391"></span> The gees for feere flowen over the trees;  
<span id="an_3392"></span> Out of the hyve cam the swarm of bees.  
<span id="an_3393"></span> So hydous was the noyse -- a, benedicitee!
--  
<span id="an_3394"></span> Certes, he Jakke Straw and his meynee  
<span id="an_3395"></span> Ne made nevere shoutes half so shrille  
<span id="an_3396"></span> Whan that they wolden any Flemyng kille,  
<span id="an_3397"></span> As thilke day was maad upon the fox.  
<span id="an_3398"></span> Of bras they broghten bemes, and of box,  
<span id="an_3399"></span> Of horn, of boon, in whiche they blewe and
powped,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3400">3400</span></span> And
therwithal they skriked and they howped.  
<span id="an_3401"></span> It semed as that hevene sholde falle.  
<span id="an_3402"></span> Now, goode men, I prey yow herkneth alle:  
<span id="an_3403"></span> Lo, how Fortune turneth sodeynly  
<span id="an_3404"></span> The hope and pryde eek of hir enemy!  
<span id="an_3405"></span> This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak,  
<span id="an_3406"></span> In al his drede unto the fox he spak,  
<span id="an_3407"></span> And seyde, "Sire, if that I were as ye,  
<span id="an_3408"></span> Yet sholde I seyn, as wys God helpe me,  
<span id="an_3409"></span> \`Turneth agayn, ye proude cherles alle!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3410">3410</span></span> A verray
pestilence upon yow falle!  
<span id="an_3411"></span> Now I am come unto the wodes syde;  
<span id="an_3412"></span> Maugree youre heed, the cok shal heere
abyde.  
<span id="an_3413"></span> I wol hym ete, in feith, and that anon!'"  
<span id="an_3414"></span> The fox answerde, "In feith, it shal be
don."  
<span id="an_3415"></span> And as he spak that word, al sodeynly  
<span id="an_3416"></span> This cok brak from his mouth delyverly,  
<span id="an_3417"></span> And heighe upon a tree he fleigh anon.  
<span id="an_3418"></span> And whan the fox saugh that the cok was

<span id="an_3419"></span> "Allas!" quod he, "O Chauntecleer, allas!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3420">3420</span></span> I have to

<span id="an_3433"></span> "Nay," quod the fox, "but God yeve hym
