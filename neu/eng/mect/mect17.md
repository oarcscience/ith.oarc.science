### The Clerk's Prologue

<span id="an_1"></span> "Sire Clerk of Oxenford," oure Hooste sayde,  
<span id="an_2"></span> "Ye ryde as coy and stille as dooth a mayde  
<span id="an_3"></span> Were newe spoused, sittynge at the bord;  
<span id="an_4"></span> This day ne herde I of youre tonge a word.  
<span id="an_5"></span> I trowe ye studie aboute som sophyme;  
<span id="an_6"></span> But Salomon seith \`every thyng hath tyme.'  
<span id="an_7"></span> "For Goddes sake, as beth of bettre cheere!  
<span id="an_8"></span> It is no tyme for to studien heere.  
<span id="an_9"></span> Telle us som myrie tale, by youre fey!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> For what man
that is entred in a pley,  
<span id="an_11"></span> He nedes moot unto the pley assente.  
<span id="an_12"></span> But precheth nat, as freres doon in Lente,  
<span id="an_13"></span> To make us for oure olde synnes wepe,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Ne that thy tale make us nat to slepe.  
<span id="an_15"></span> "Telle us som murie thyng of aventures.  
<span id="an_16"></span> Youre termes, youre colours, and youre
figures,  
<span id="an_17"></span> Keepe hem in stoor til so be ye endite  
<span id="an_18"></span> Heigh style, as whan that men to kynges
write.  
<span id="an_19"></span> Speketh so pleyn at this tyme, we yow preye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> That we may
understonde what ye seye."  
<span id="an_21"></span> This worthy clerk benignely answerde:  
<span id="an_22"></span> "Hooste," quod he, "I am under youre yerde;  
<span id="an_23"></span> Ye han of us as now the governance,  
<span id="an_24"></span> And therfore wol I do yow obeisance,  
<span id="an_25"></span> As fer as resoun axeth, hardily.  
<span id="an_26"></span> I wol yow telle a tale which that I  
<span id="an_27"></span> Lerned at Padowe of a worthy clerk,  
<span id="an_28"></span> As preved by his wordes and his werk.  
<span id="an_29"></span> He is now deed and nayled in his cheste;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> I prey to God
so yeve his soule reste!  
<span id="an_31"></span> "Fraunceys Petrak, the lauriat poete,  
<span id="an_32"></span> Highte this clerk, whos rethorike sweete  
<span id="an_33"></span> Enlumyned al Ytaille of poetrie,  
<span id="an_34"></span> As Lynyan dide of philosophie,  
<span id="an_35"></span> Or lawe, or oother art particuler;  
<span id="an_36"></span> But Deeth, that wol nat suffre us dwellen
heer,  
<span id="an_37"></span> But as it were a twynklyng of an ye,  
<span id="an_38"></span> Hem bothe hath slayn, and alle shul we dye.  
<span id="an_39"></span> "But forth to tellen of this worthy man  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> That taughte me
this tale, as I bigan,  
<span id="an_41"></span> I seye that first with heigh stile he
enditeth,  
<span id="an_42"></span> Er he the body of his tale writeth,  
<span id="an_43"></span> A prohemye, in the which discryveth he  
<span id="an_44"></span> Pemond and of Saluces the contree,  
<span id="an_45"></span> And speketh of Apennyn, the hilles hye,  
<span id="an_46"></span> That been the boundes of West Lumbardye,  
<span id="an_47"></span> And of Mount Vesulus in special,  
<span id="an_48"></span> Where as the Poo out of a welle smal  
<span id="an_49"></span> Taketh his firste spryngyng and his sours,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> That estward ay
encresseth in his cours  
<span id="an_51"></span> To Emele-ward, to Ferrare, and Venyse,  
<span id="an_52"></span> The which a long thyng were to devyse.  
<span id="an_53"></span> And trewely, as to my juggement,  
<span id="an_54"></span> Me thynketh it a thyng impertinent,  
<span id="an_55"></span> Save that he wole conveyen his mateere;  
<span id="an_56"></span> But this his tale, which that ye may heere."
