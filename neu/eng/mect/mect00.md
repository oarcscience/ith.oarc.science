#### The Canterbury Tales

### General Prologue

<span id="an_1"></span> Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote  
<span id="an_2"></span> The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,  
<span id="an_3"></span> And bathed every veyne in swich licour  
<span id="an_4"></span> Of which vertu engendred is the flour;  
<span id="an_5"></span> Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth  
<span id="an_6"></span> Inspired hath in every holt and heeth  
<span id="an_7"></span> The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne  
<span id="an_8"></span> Hath in the Ram his half cours yronne,  
<span id="an_9"></span> And smale foweles maken melodye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> That slepen al
the nyght with open ye  
<span id="an_11"></span> (So priketh hem Nature in hir corages),  
<span id="an_12"></span> Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,  
<span id="an_13"></span> And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,  
<span id="an_14"></span> To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;  
<span id="an_15"></span> And specially from every shires ende  
<span id="an_16"></span> Of Engelond to Caunterbury they wende,  
<span id="an_17"></span> The hooly blisful martir for to seke,  
<span id="an_18"></span> That hem hath holpen whan that they were
seeke.  
<span id="an_19"></span> Bifil that in that seson on a day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> In Southwerk at
the Tabard as I lay  
<span id="an_21"></span> Redy to wenden on my pilgrymage  
<span id="an_22"></span> To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,  
<span id="an_23"></span> At nyght was come into that hostelrye  
<span id="an_24"></span> Wel nyne and twenty in a compaignye  
<span id="an_25"></span> Of sondry folk, by aventure yfalle  
<span id="an_26"></span> In felaweshipe, and pilgrimes were they alle,  
<span id="an_27"></span> That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde.  
<span id="an_28"></span> The chambres and the stables weren wyde,  
<span id="an_29"></span> And wel we weren esed atte beste.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> And shortly,
whan the sonne was to reste,  
<span id="an_31"></span> So hadde I spoken with hem everichon  
<span id="an_32"></span> That I was of hir felaweshipe anon,  
<span id="an_33"></span> And made forward erly for to ryse,  
<span id="an_34"></span> To take oure wey ther as I yow devyse.  
<span id="an_35"></span> But nathelees, whil I have tyme and space,  
<span id="an_36"></span> Er that I ferther in this tale pace,  
<span id="an_37"></span> Me thynketh it acordaunt to resoun  
<span id="an_38"></span> To telle yow al the condicioun  
<span id="an_39"></span> Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> And whiche they
weren, and of what degree,  
<span id="an_41"></span> And eek in what array that they were inne;  
<span id="an_42"></span> And at a knyght than wol I first bigynne.  
<span id="an_43"></span> A KNYGHT ther was, and that a worthy man,  
<span id="an_44"></span> That fro the tyme that he first bigan  
<span id="an_45"></span> To riden out, he loved chivalrie,  
<span id="an_46"></span> Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisie.  
<span id="an_47"></span> Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,  
<span id="an_48"></span> And therto hadde he riden, no man ferre,  
<span id="an_49"></span> As wel in cristendom as in hethenesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> And evere
honoured for his worthynesse;  
<span id="an_51"></span> At Alisaundre he was whan it was wonne.  
<span id="an_52"></span> Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne  
<span id="an_53"></span> Aboven alle nacions in Pruce;  
<span id="an_54"></span> In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,  
<span id="an_55"></span> No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.  
<span id="an_56"></span> In Gernade at the seege eek hadde he be  
<span id="an_57"></span> Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye.  
<span id="an_58"></span> At Lyeys was he and at Satalye,  
<span id="an_59"></span> Whan they were wonne, and in the Grete See  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> At many a noble
armee hadde he be.  
<span id="an_61"></span> At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,  
<span id="an_62"></span> And foughten for oure feith at Tramyssene  
<span id="an_63"></span> In lystes thries, and ay slayn his foo.  
<span id="an_64"></span> This ilke worthy knyght hadde been also  
<span id="an_65"></span> Somtyme with the lord of Palatye  
<span id="an_66"></span> Agayn another hethen in Turkye;  
<span id="an_67"></span> And everemoore he hadde a sovereyn prys.  
<span id="an_68"></span> And though that he were worthy, he was wys,  
<span id="an_69"></span> And of his port as meeke as is a mayde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> He nevere yet
no vileynye ne sayde  
<span id="an_71"></span> In al his lyf unto no maner wight.  
<span id="an_72"></span> He was a verray, parfit gentil knyght.  
<span id="an_73"></span> But for to tellen yow of his array,  
<span id="an_74"></span> His hors were goode, but he was nat gay.  
<span id="an_75"></span> Of fustian he wered a gypon  
<span id="an_76"></span> Al bismotered with his habergeon,  
<span id="an_77"></span> For he was late ycome from his viage,  
<span id="an_78"></span> And wente for to doon his pilgrymage.  
<span id="an_79"></span> With hym ther was his sone, a yong SQUIER,  

 

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> A lovyere and a
lusty bacheler,  
<span id="an_81"></span> With lokkes crulle as they were leyd in
presse.  
<span id="an_82"></span> Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.  
<span id="an_83"></span> Of his stature he was of evene lengthe,  
<span id="an_84"></span> And wonderly delyvere, and of greet
strengthe.  
<span id="an_85"></span> And he hadde been somtyme in chyvachie  
<span id="an_86"></span> In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Pycardie,  
<span id="an_87"></span> And born hym weel, as of so litel space,  
<span id="an_88"></span> In hope to stonden in his lady grace.  
<span id="an_89"></span> Embrouded was he, as it were a meede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Al ful of
fresshe floures, whyte and reede.  
<span id="an_91"></span> Syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day;  
<span id="an_92"></span> He was as fressh as is the month of May.  
<span id="an_93"></span> Short was his gowne, with sleves longe and
wyde.  
<span id="an_94"></span> Wel koude he sitte on hors and faire ryde.  
<span id="an_95"></span> He koude songes make and wel endite,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Juste and eek daunce, and weel purtreye and
write.  
<span id="an_97"></span> So hoote he lovede that by nyghtertale  
<span id="an_98"></span> He sleep namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale.  
<span id="an_99"></span> Curteis he was, lowely, and servysable,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> And carf
biforn his fader at the table.  
<span id="an_101"></span> A YEMAN hadde he and servantz namo  
<span id="an_102"></span> At that tyme, for hym liste ride so,  
<span id="an_103"></span> And he was clad in cote and hood of grene.  
<span id="an_104"></span> A sheef of pecok arwes, bright and kene,  
<span id="an_105"></span> Under his belt he bar ful thriftily  
<span id="an_106"></span> (Wel koude he dresse his takel yemanly;  
<span id="an_107"></span> His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),  
<span id="an_108"></span> And in his hand he baar a myghty bowe.  
<span id="an_109"></span> A not heed hadde he, with a broun visage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Of wodecraft
wel koude he al the usage.  
<span id="an_111"></span> Upon his arm he baar a gay bracer,  
<span id="an_112"></span> And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,  
<span id="an_113"></span> And on that oother syde a gay daggere  
<span id="an_114"></span> Harneised wel and sharp as point of spere;  
<span id="an_115"></span> A Cristopher on his brest of silver sheene.  
<span id="an_116"></span> An horn he bar, the bawdryk was of grene;  
<span id="an_117"></span> A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.  
<span id="an_118"></span> Ther was also a Nonne, a PRIORESSE,  
<span id="an_119"></span> That of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> Hire
gretteste ooth was but by Seinte Loy;  
<span id="an_121"></span> And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.  
<span id="an_122"></span> Ful weel she soong the service dyvyne,  
<span id="an_123"></span> Entuned in hir nose ful semely;  
<span id="an_124"></span> And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly,  
<span id="an_125"></span> After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,  
<span id="an_126"></span> For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe.  
<span id="an_127"></span> At mete wel ytaught was she with alle;  
<span id="an_128"></span> She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,  
<span id="an_129"></span> Ne wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> Wel koude she
carie a morsel and wel kepe  
<span id="an_131"></span> That no drope ne fille upon hire brest.  
<span id="an_132"></span> In curteisie was set ful muchel hir lest.  
<span id="an_133"></span> Hir over-lippe wyped she so clene  
<span id="an_134"></span> That in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sene  
<span id="an_135"></span> Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir
draughte.  
<span id="an_136"></span> Ful semely after hir mete she raughte.  
<span id="an_137"></span> And sikerly she was of greet desport,  
<span id="an_138"></span> And ful plesaunt, and amyable of port,  
<span id="an_139"></span> And peyned hire to countrefete cheere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Of court, and
to been estatlich of manere,  
<span id="an_141"></span> And to ben holden digne of reverence.  
<span id="an_142"></span> But for to speken of hire conscience,  
<span id="an_143"></span> She was so charitable and so pitous  
<span id="an_144"></span> She wolde wepe, if that she saugh a mous  
<span id="an_145"></span> Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or
bledde.  
<span id="an_146"></span> Of smale houndes hadde she that she fedde  
<span id="an_147"></span> With rosted flessh, or milk and
wastel-breed.  
<span id="an_148"></span> But soore wepte she if oon of hem were deed,  
<span id="an_149"></span> Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> And al was
conscience and tendre herte.  
<span id="an_151"></span> Ful semyly hir wympul pynched was,  
<span id="an_152"></span> Hir nose tretys, hir eyen greye as glas,  
<span id="an_153"></span> Hir mouth ful smal, and therto softe and
reed.  
<span id="an_154"></span> But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;  
<span id="an_155"></span> It was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe;  
<span id="an_156"></span> For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.  
<span id="an_157"></span> Ful fetys was hir cloke, as I was war.  
<span id="an_158"></span> Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar  
<span id="an_159"></span> A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> And theron
heng a brooch of gold ful sheene,  
<span id="an_161"></span> On which ther was first write a crowned A,  
<span id="an_162"></span> And after Amor vincit omnia.  
<span id="an_163"></span> Another NONNE with hire hadde she,  
<span id="an_164"></span> That was hir chapeleyne, and preestes thre.  
<span id="an_165"></span> A MONK ther was, a fair for the maistrie,  
<span id="an_166"></span> An outridere, that lovede venerie,  
<span id="an_167"></span> A manly man, to been an abbot able.  
<span id="an_168"></span> Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable,  
<span id="an_169"></span> And whan he rood, men myghte his brydel
heere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> Gynglen in a
whistlynge wynd als cleere  
<span id="an_171"></span> And eek as loude as dooth the chapel belle  
<span id="an_172"></span> Ther as this lord was kepere of the celle.  
<span id="an_173"></span> The reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit
--  
<span id="an_174"></span> By cause that it was old and somdel streit  
<span id="an_175"></span> This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace,  
<span id="an_176"></span> And heeld after the newe world the space.  
<span id="an_177"></span> He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,  
<span id="an_178"></span> That seith that hunters ben nat hooly men,  
<span id="an_179"></span> Ne that a monk, whan he is recchelees,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> Is likned til
a fissh that is waterlees --  
<span id="an_181"></span> This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre.  
<span id="an_182"></span> But thilke text heeld he nat worth an
oystre;  
<span id="an_183"></span> And I seyde his opinion was good.  
<span id="an_184"></span> What sholde he studie and make hymselven
wood,  
<span id="an_185"></span> Upon a book in cloystre alwey to poure,  
<span id="an_186"></span> Or swynken with his handes, and laboure,  
<span id="an_187"></span> As Austyn bit? How shal the world be served?  
<span id="an_188"></span> Lat Austyn have his swynk to hym reserved!  
<span id="an_189"></span> Therfore he was a prikasour aright:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> Grehoundes he
hadde as swift as fowel in flight;  
<span id="an_191"></span> Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare  
<span id="an_192"></span> Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.  
<span id="an_193"></span> I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond  
<span id="an_194"></span> With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;  
<span id="an_195"></span> And for to festne his hood under his chyn,  
<span id="an_196"></span> He hadde of gold ywroght a ful curious pyn;  
<span id="an_197"></span> A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.  
<span id="an_198"></span> His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,  
<span id="an_199"></span> And eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> He was a lord
ful fat and in good poynt;  
<span id="an_201"></span> His eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed,  
<span id="an_202"></span> That stemed as a forneys of a leed;  
<span id="an_203"></span> His bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat.  
<span id="an_204"></span> Now certeinly he was a fair prelaat;  
<span id="an_205"></span> He was nat pale as a forpyned goost.  
<span id="an_206"></span> A fat swan loved he best of any roost.  
<span id="an_207"></span> His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.  
<span id="an_208"></span> A FRERE ther was, a wantowne and a merye,  
<span id="an_209"></span> A lymytour, a ful solempne man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> In alle the
ordres foure is noon that kan  
<span id="an_211"></span> So muchel of daliaunce and fair langage.  
<span id="an_212"></span> He hadde maad ful many a mariage  
<span id="an_213"></span> Of yonge wommen at his owene cost.  
<span id="an_214"></span> Unto his ordre he was a noble post.  
<span id="an_215"></span> Ful wel biloved and famulier was he  
<span id="an_216"></span> With frankeleyns over al in his contree,  
<span id="an_217"></span> And eek with worthy wommen of the toun;  
<span id="an_218"></span> For he hadde power of confessioun,  
<span id="an_219"></span> As seyde hymself, moore than a curat,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> For of his
ordre he was licenciat.  
<span id="an_221"></span> Ful swetely herde he confessioun,  
<span id="an_222"></span> And plesaunt was his absolucioun:  
<span id="an_223"></span> He was an esy man to yeve penaunce,  
<span id="an_224"></span> Ther as he wiste to have a good pitaunce.  
<span id="an_225"></span> For unto a povre ordre for to yive  
<span id="an_226"></span> Is signe that a man is wel yshryve;  
<span id="an_227"></span> For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,  
<span id="an_228"></span> He wiste that a man was repentaunt;  
<span id="an_229"></span> For many a man so hard is of his herte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> He may nat
wepe, althogh hym soore smerte.  
<span id="an_231"></span> Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeres  
<span id="an_232"></span> Men moote yeve silver to the povre freres.  
<span id="an_233"></span> His typet was ay farsed ful of knyves  

 

<span id="an_234"></span> And pynnes, for to yeven faire wyves.  
<span id="an_235"></span> And certeinly he hadde a murye note:  
<span id="an_236"></span> Wel koude he synge and pleyen on a rote;  
<span id="an_237"></span> Of yeddynges he baar outrely the pris.  
<span id="an_238"></span> His nekke whit was as the flour-de-lys;  
<span id="an_239"></span> Therto he strong was as a champioun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> He knew the
tavernes wel in every toun  
<span id="an_241"></span> And everich hostiler and tappestere  
<span id="an_242"></span> Bet than a lazar or a beggestere,  
<span id="an_243"></span> For unto swich a worthy man as he  
<span id="an_244"></span> Acorded nat, as by his facultee,  
<span id="an_245"></span> To have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce.  
<span id="an_246"></span> It is nat honest; it may nat avaunce,  
<span id="an_247"></span> For to deelen with no swich poraille,  
<span id="an_248"></span> But al with riche and selleres of vitaille.  
<span id="an_249"></span> And over al, ther as profit sholde arise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> Curteis he
was and lowely of servyse;  
<span id="an_251"></span> Ther nas no man nowher so vertuous.  
<span id="an_252"></span> He was the beste beggere in his hous;  
<span id="an_252a"></span> \[And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt;  
<span id="an_252b"></span> Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his
haunt;\]  
<span id="an_253"></span> For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho,  
<span id="an_254"></span> So plesaunt was his "In principio,"  
<span id="an_255"></span> Yet wolde he have a ferthyng, er he wente.  
<span id="an_256"></span> His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.  
<span id="an_257"></span> And rage he koude, as it were right a whelp.  
<span id="an_258"></span> In love-dayes ther koude he muchel help,  
<span id="an_259"></span> For ther he was nat lyk a cloysterer  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> With a
thredbare cope, as is a povre scoler,  
<span id="an_261"></span> But he was lyk a maister or a pope.  
<span id="an_262"></span> Of double worstede was his semycope,  
<span id="an_263"></span> That rounded as a belle out of the presse.  
<span id="an_264"></span> Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,  
<span id="an_265"></span> To make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge;  
<span id="an_266"></span> And in his harpyng, whan that he hadde
songe,  
<span id="an_267"></span> His eyen twynkled in his heed aryght  
<span id="an_268"></span> As doon the sterres in the frosty nyght.  
<span id="an_269"></span> This worthy lymytour was cleped Huberd.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> A MARCHANT
was ther with a forked berd,  
<span id="an_271"></span> In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat;  
<span id="an_272"></span> Upon his heed a Flaundryssh bever hat,  
<span id="an_273"></span> His bootes clasped faire and fetisly.  
<span id="an_274"></span> His resons he spak ful solempnely,  
<span id="an_275"></span> Sownynge alwey th' encrees of his wynnyng.  
<span id="an_276"></span> He wolde the see were kept for any thyng  
<span id="an_277"></span> Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle.  
<span id="an_278"></span> Wel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.  
<span id="an_279"></span> This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> Ther wiste no
wight that he was in dette,  
<span id="an_281"></span> So estatly was he of his governaunce  
<span id="an_282"></span> With his bargaynes and with his
chevyssaunce.  
<span id="an_283"></span> For sothe he was a worthy man with alle,  
<span id="an_284"></span> But, sooth to seyn, I noot how men hym
calle.  
<span id="an_285"></span> A CLERK ther was of Oxenford also,  
<span id="an_286"></span> That unto logyk hadde longe ygo.  
<span id="an_287"></span> As leene was his hors as is a rake,  
<span id="an_288"></span> And he nas nat right fat, I undertake,  
<span id="an_289"></span> But looked holwe, and therto sobrely.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> Ful thredbare
was his overeste courtepy,  
<span id="an_291"></span> For he hadde geten hym yet no benefice,  
<span id="an_292"></span> Ne was so worldly for to have office.  
<span id="an_293"></span> For hym was levere have at his beddes heed  
<span id="an_294"></span> Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,  
<span id="an_295"></span> Of Aristotle and his philosophie  
<span id="an_296"></span> Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay
sautrie.  
<span id="an_297"></span> But al be that he was a philosophre,  
<span id="an_298"></span> Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;  
<span id="an_299"></span> But al that he myghte of his freendes hente,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> On bookes and
on lernynge he it spente,  
<span id="an_301"></span> And bisily gan for the soules preye  
<span id="an_302"></span> Of hem that yaf hym wherwith to scoleye.  
<span id="an_303"></span> Of studie took he moost cure and moost
heede.  
<span id="an_304"></span> Noght o word spak he moore than was neede,  
<span id="an_305"></span> And that was seyd in forme and reverence,  
<span id="an_306"></span> And short and quyk and ful of hy sentence;  
<span id="an_307"></span> Sownynge in moral vertu was his speche,  
<span id="an_308"></span> And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche.  
<span id="an_309"></span> A SERGEANT OF THE LAWE, war and wys,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310">310</span></span> That often
hadde been at the Parvys,  
<span id="an_311"></span> Ther was also, ful riche of excellence.  
<span id="an_312"></span> Discreet he was and of greet reverence --  
<span id="an_313"></span> He semed swich, his wordes weren so wise.  
<span id="an_314"></span> Justice he was ful often in assise,  
<span id="an_315"></span> By patente and by pleyn commissioun.  
<span id="an_316"></span> For his science and for his heigh renoun,  
<span id="an_317"></span> Of fees and robes hadde he many oon.  

 

<span id="an_318"></span> So greet a purchasour was nowher noon:  
<span id="an_319"></span> Al was fee symple to hym in effect;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> His
purchasyng myghte nat been infect.  
<span id="an_321"></span> Nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas,  
<span id="an_322"></span> And yet he semed bisier than he was.  
<span id="an_323"></span> In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle  
<span id="an_324"></span> That from the tyme of kyng William were
falle.  
<span id="an_325"></span> Therto he koude endite and make a thyng,  
<span id="an_326"></span> Ther koude no wight pynche at his writyng;  
<span id="an_327"></span> And every statut koude he pleyn by rote.  
<span id="an_328"></span> He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote,  
<span id="an_329"></span> Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres
smale;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> Of his array
telle I no lenger tale.  
<span id="an_331"></span> A FRANKELEYN was in his compaignye.  
<span id="an_332"></span> Whit was his berd as is the dayesye;  
<span id="an_333"></span> Of his complexioun he was sangwyn.  
<span id="an_334"></span> Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn;  
<span id="an_335"></span> To lyven in delit was evere his wone,  
<span id="an_336"></span> For he was Epicurus owene sone,  
<span id="an_337"></span> That heeld opinioun that pleyn delit  
<span id="an_338"></span> Was verray felicitee parfit.  
<span id="an_339"></span> An housholdere, and that a greet, was he;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> Seint Julian
he was in his contree.  
<span id="an_341"></span> His breed, his ale, was alweys after oon;  
<span id="an_342"></span> A bettre envyned man was nowher noon.  
<span id="an_343"></span> Withoute bake mete was nevere his hous,  
<span id="an_344"></span> Of fissh and flessh, and that so plentevous  
<span id="an_345"></span> It snewed in his hous of mete and drynke;  
<span id="an_346"></span> Of alle deyntees that men koude thynke,  
<span id="an_347"></span> After the sondry sesons of the yeer,  
<span id="an_348"></span> So chaunged he his mete and his soper.  
<span id="an_349"></span> Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> And many a
breem and many a luce in stuwe.  
<span id="an_351"></span> Wo was his cook but if his sauce were  
<span id="an_352"></span> Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geere.  
<span id="an_353"></span> His table dormant in his halle alway  
<span id="an_354"></span> Stood redy covered al the longe day.  
<span id="an_355"></span> At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;  
<span id="an_356"></span> Ful ofte tyme he was knyght of the shire.  
<span id="an_357"></span> An anlaas and a gipser al of silk  
<span id="an_358"></span> Heeng at his girdel, whit as morne milk.  
<span id="an_359"></span> A shirreve hadde he been, and a contour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> Was nowher
swich a worthy vavasour.  
<span id="an_361"></span> AN HABERDASSHERE and a CARPENTER,  
<span id="an_362"></span> A WEBBE, a DYERE, and a TAPYCER --  
<span id="an_363"></span> And they were clothed alle in o lyveree  
<span id="an_364"></span> Of a solempne and a greet fraternitee.  
<span id="an_365"></span> Ful fressh and newe hir geere apiked was;  
<span id="an_366"></span> Hir knyves were chaped noght with bras  
<span id="an_367"></span> But al with silver, wroght ful clene and
weel,  
<span id="an_368"></span> Hire girdles and hir pouches everydeel.  
<span id="an_369"></span> Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> To sitten in
a yeldehalle on a deys.  
<span id="an_371"></span> Everich, for the wisdom that he kan,  
<span id="an_372"></span> Was shaply for to been an alderman.  
<span id="an_373"></span> For catel hadde they ynogh and rente,  
<span id="an_374"></span> And eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente;  
<span id="an_375"></span> And elles certeyn were they to blame.  
<span id="an_376"></span> It is ful fair to been ycleped "madame,"  
<span id="an_377"></span> And goon to vigilies al bifore,  
<span id="an_378"></span> And have a mantel roialliche ybore.  
<span id="an_379"></span> A COOK they hadde with hem for the nones  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> To boille the
chiknes with the marybones,  
<span id="an_381"></span> And poudre-marchant tart and galyngale.  
<span id="an_382"></span> Wel koude he knowe a draughte of Londoun
ale.  
<span id="an_383"></span> He koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and
frye,  
<span id="an_384"></span> Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye.  
<span id="an_385"></span> But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me,  
<span id="an_386"></span> That on his shyne a mormal hadde he.  
<span id="an_387"></span> For blankmanger, that made he with the
beste.  
<span id="an_388"></span> A SHIPMAN was ther, wonynge fer by weste;  
<span id="an_389"></span> For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> He rood upon
a rouncy, as he kouthe,  
<span id="an_391"></span> In a gowne of faldyng to the knee.  
<span id="an_392"></span> A daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he  
<span id="an_393"></span> Aboute his nekke, under his arm adoun.  
<span id="an_394"></span> The hoote somer hadde maad his hewe al
broun;  
<span id="an_395"></span> And certeinly he was a good felawe.  
<span id="an_396"></span> Ful many a draughte of wyn had he ydrawe  
<span id="an_397"></span> Fro Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman
sleep.  
<span id="an_398"></span> Of nyce conscience took he no keep.  
<span id="an_399"></span> If that he faught and hadde the hyer hond,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> By water he
sente hem hoom to every lond.  
<span id="an_401"></span> But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes,  
<span id="an_402"></span> His stremes, and his daungers hym bisides,  
<span id="an_403"></span> His herberwe, and his moone, his lodemenage,  
<span id="an_404"></span> Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage.  
<span id="an_405"></span> Hardy he was and wys to undertake;  
<span id="an_406"></span> With many a tempest hadde his berd been
shake.  
<span id="an_407"></span> He knew alle the havenes, as they were,  
<span id="an_408"></span> Fro Gootlond to the cape of Fynystere,  
<span id="an_409"></span> And every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> His barge
ycleped was the Maudelayne.  
<span id="an_411"></span> With us ther was a DOCTOUR OF PHISIK;  
<span id="an_412"></span> In al this world ne was ther noon hym lik,  
<span id="an_413"></span> To speke of phisik and of surgerye,  
<span id="an_414"></span> For he was grounded in astronomye.  
<span id="an_415"></span> He kepte his pacient a ful greet deel  
<span id="an_416"></span> In houres by his magyk natureel.  
<span id="an_417"></span> Wel koude he fortunen the ascendent  
<span id="an_418"></span> Of his ymages for his pacient.  
<span id="an_419"></span> He knew the cause of everich maladye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> Were it of
hoot, or coold, or moyste, or drye,  
<span id="an_421"></span> And where they engendred, and of what
humour.  
<span id="an_422"></span> He was a verray, parfit praktisour:  
<span id="an_423"></span> The cause yknowe, and of his harm the roote,  
<span id="an_424"></span> Anon he yaf the sike man his boote.  
<span id="an_425"></span> Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries  
<span id="an_426"></span> To sende hym drogges and his letuaries,  
<span id="an_427"></span> For ech of hem made oother for to wynne --  
<span id="an_428"></span> Hir frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne.  
<span id="an_429"></span> Wel knew he the olde Esculapius,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> And
Deyscorides, and eek Rufus,  
<span id="an_431"></span> Olde Ypocras, Haly, and Galyen,  
<span id="an_432"></span> Serapion, Razis, and Avycen,  
<span id="an_433"></span> Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn,  
<span id="an_434"></span> Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn.  
<span id="an_435"></span> Of his diete mesurable was he,  
<span id="an_436"></span> For it was of no superfluitee,  
<span id="an_437"></span> But of greet norissyng and digestible.  
<span id="an_438"></span> His studie was but litel on the Bible.  
<span id="an_439"></span> In sangwyn and in pers he clad was al,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> Lyned with
taffata and with sendal.  
<span id="an_441"></span> And yet he was but esy of dispence;  
<span id="an_442"></span> He kepte that he wan in pestilence.  
<span id="an_443"></span> For gold in phisik is a cordial,  
<span id="an_444"></span> Therefore he lovede gold in special.  
<span id="an_445"></span> A good WIF was ther OF biside BATHE,  
<span id="an_446"></span> But she was somdel deef, and that was
scathe.  
<span id="an_447"></span> Of clooth-makyng she hadde swich an haunt  
<span id="an_448"></span> She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt.  
<span id="an_449"></span> In al the parisshe wif ne was ther noon  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> That to the
offrynge bifore hire sholde goon;  
<span id="an_451"></span> And if ther dide, certeyn so wrooth was she  
<span id="an_452"></span> That she was out of alle charitee.  
<span id="an_453"></span> Hir coverchiefs ful fyne weren of ground;  
<span id="an_454"></span> I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound  
<span id="an_455"></span> That on a Sonday weren upon hir heed.  
<span id="an_456"></span> Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed,  
<span id="an_457"></span> Ful streite yteyd, and shoes ful moyste and
newe.  
<span id="an_458"></span> Boold was hir face, and fair, and reed of
hewe.  
<span id="an_459"></span> She was a worthy womman al hir lyve:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> Housbondes at
chirche dore she hadde fyve,  
<span id="an_461"></span> Withouten oother compaignye in youthe --  
<span id="an_462"></span> But thereof nedeth nat to speke as nowthe.  
<span id="an_463"></span> And thries hadde she been at Jerusalem;  
<span id="an_464"></span> She hadde passed many a straunge strem;  
<span id="an_465"></span> At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne,  
<span id="an_466"></span> In Galice at Seint-Jame, and at Coloigne.  
<span id="an_467"></span> She koude muchel of wandrynge by the weye.  
<span id="an_468"></span> Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye.  
<span id="an_469"></span> Upon an amblere esily she sat,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> Ywympled wel,
and on hir heed an hat  
<span id="an_471"></span> As brood as is a bokeler or a targe;  
<span id="an_472"></span> A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large,  
<span id="an_473"></span> And on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe.  
<span id="an_474"></span> In felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and
carpe.  
<span id="an_475"></span> Of remedies of love she knew per chaunce,  
<span id="an_476"></span> For she koude of that art the olde daunce.  
<span id="an_477"></span> A good man was ther of religioun,  
<span id="an_478"></span> And was a povre PERSOUN OF A TOUN,  
<span id="an_479"></span> But riche he was of hooly thoght and werk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> He was also a
lerned man, a clerk,  
<span id="an_481"></span> That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;  
<span id="an_482"></span> His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.  
<span id="an_483"></span> Benygne he was, and wonder diligent,  
<span id="an_484"></span> And in adversitee ful pacient,  
<span id="an_485"></span> And swich he was ypreved ofte sithes.  
<span id="an_486"></span> Ful looth were hym to cursen for his tithes,  
<span id="an_487"></span> But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute,  
<span id="an_488"></span> Unto his povre parisshens aboute  
<span id="an_489"></span> Of his offryng and eek of his substaunce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> He koude in
litel thyng have suffisaunce.  
<span id="an_491"></span> Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer
asonder,  
<span id="an_492"></span> But he ne lefte nat, for reyn ne thonder,  
<span id="an_493"></span> In siknesse nor in meschief to visite  
<span id="an_494"></span> The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and
lite,  
<span id="an_495"></span> Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf.  
<span id="an_496"></span> This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf,  
<span id="an_497"></span> That first he wroghte, and afterward he
taughte.  
<span id="an_498"></span> Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte,  
<span id="an_499"></span> And this figure he added eek therto,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> That if gold
ruste, what shal iren do?  
<span id="an_501"></span> For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste,  
<span id="an_502"></span> No wonder is a lewed man to ruste;  
<span id="an_503"></span> And shame it is, if a prest take keep,  
<span id="an_504"></span> A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep.  
<span id="an_505"></span> Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive,  
<span id="an_506"></span> By his clennesse, how that his sheep sholde
lyve.  
<span id="an_507"></span> He sette nat his benefice to hyre  
<span id="an_508"></span> And leet his sheep encombred in the myre  
<span id="an_509"></span> And ran to Londoun unto Seinte Poules  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> To seken hym
a chaunterie for soules,  
<span id="an_511"></span> Or with a bretherhed to been withholde;  
<span id="an_512"></span> But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,  
<span id="an_513"></span> So that the wolf ne made it nat myscarie;  
<span id="an_514"></span> He was a shepherde and noght a mercenarie.  
<span id="an_515"></span> And though he hooly were and vertuous,  
<span id="an_516"></span> He was to synful men nat despitous,  
<span id="an_517"></span> Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne,  
<span id="an_518"></span> But in his techyng discreet and benygne.  
<span id="an_519"></span> To drawen folk to hevene by fairnesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> By good
ensample, this was his bisynesse.  
<span id="an_521"></span> But it were any persone obstinat,  
<span id="an_522"></span> What so he were, of heigh or lough estat,  
<span id="an_523"></span> Hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys.  
<span id="an_524"></span> A bettre preest I trowe that nowher noon ys.  
<span id="an_525"></span> He waited after no pompe and reverence,  
<span id="an_526"></span> Ne maked him a spiced conscience,  
<span id="an_527"></span> But Cristes loore and his apostles twelve  
<span id="an_528"></span> He taughte; but first he folwed it hymselve.  
<span id="an_529"></span> With hym ther was a PLOWMAN, was his
brother,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> That hadde
ylad of dong ful many a fother;  
<span id="an_531"></span> A trewe swynkere and a good was he,  
<span id="an_532"></span> Lyvynge in pees and parfit charitee.  
<span id="an_533"></span> God loved he best with al his hoole herte  
<span id="an_534"></span> At alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte,  
<span id="an_535"></span> And thanne his neighebor right as hymselve.  
<span id="an_536"></span> He wolde thresshe, and therto dyke and
delve,  
<span id="an_537"></span> For Cristes sake, for every povre wight,  
<span id="an_538"></span> Withouten hire, if it lay in his myght.  
<span id="an_539"></span> His tithes payde he ful faire and wel,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> Bothe of his
propre swynk and his catel.  
<span id="an_541"></span> In a tabard he rood upon a mere.  
<span id="an_542"></span> Ther was also a REVE, and a MILLERE,  
<span id="an_543"></span> A SOMNOUR, and a PARDONER also,  
<span id="an_544"></span> A MAUNCIPLE, and myself -- ther were namo.  
<span id="an_545"></span> The MILLERE was a stout carl for the nones;  
<span id="an_546"></span> Ful byg he was of brawn, and eek of bones.  
<span id="an_547"></span> That proved wel, for over al ther he cam,  
<span id="an_548"></span> At wrastlynge he wolde have alwey the ram.  
<span id="an_549"></span> He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke
knarre;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> Ther was no
dore that he nolde heve of harre,  
<span id="an_551"></span> Or breke it at a rennyng with his heed.  
<span id="an_552"></span> His berd as any sowe or fox was reed,  
<span id="an_553"></span> And therto brood, as though it were a spade.  
<span id="an_554"></span> Upon the cop right of his nose he hade  
<span id="an_555"></span> A werte, and theron stood a toft of herys,  
<span id="an_556"></span> Reed as the brustles of a sowes erys;  
<span id="an_557"></span> His nosethirles blake were and wyde.  
<span id="an_558"></span> A swerd and a bokeler bar he by his syde.  
<span id="an_559"></span> His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> He was a
janglere and a goliardeys,  
<span id="an_561"></span> And that was moost of synne and harlotries.  
<span id="an_562"></span> Wel koude he stelen corn and tollen thries;  
<span id="an_563"></span> And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee.  
<span id="an_564"></span> A whit cote and a blew hood wered he.  
<span id="an_565"></span> A baggepipe wel koude he blowe and sowne,  
<span id="an_566"></span> And therwithal he broghte us out of towne.  
<span id="an_567"></span> A gentil MAUNCIPLE was ther of a temple,  
<span id="an_568"></span> Of which achatours myghte take exemple  
<span id="an_569"></span> For to be wise in byynge of vitaille;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> For wheither
that he payde or took by taille,  
<span id="an_571"></span> Algate he wayted so in his achaat  
<span id="an_572"></span> That he was ay biforn and in good staat.  
<span id="an_573"></span> Now is nat that of God a ful fair grace  
<span id="an_574"></span> That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace  
<span id="an_575"></span> The wisdom of an heep of lerned men?  
<span id="an_576"></span> Of maistres hadde he mo than thries ten,  
<span id="an_577"></span> That weren of lawe expert and curious,  
<span id="an_578"></span> Of which ther were a duszeyne in that hous  
<span id="an_579"></span> Worthy to been stywardes of rente and lond  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> Of any lord
that is in Engelond,  
<span id="an_581"></span> To make hym lyve by his propre good  
<span id="an_582"></span> In honour dettelees (but if he were wood),  
<span id="an_583"></span> Or lyve as scarsly as hym list desire;  
<span id="an_584"></span> And able for to helpen al a shire  
<span id="an_585"></span> In any caas that myghte falle or happe.  
<span id="an_586"></span> And yet this Manciple sette hir aller cappe.  
<span id="an_587"></span> The REVE was a sclendre colerik man.  
<span id="an_588"></span> His berd was shave as ny as ever he kan;  
<span id="an_589"></span> His heer was by his erys ful round yshorn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> His top was
dokked lyk a preest biforn.  
<span id="an_591"></span> Ful longe were his legges and ful lene,  
<span id="an_592"></span> Ylyk a staf; ther was no calf ysene.  
<span id="an_593"></span> Wel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne;  
<span id="an_594"></span> Ther was noon auditour koude on him wynne.  
<span id="an_595"></span> Wel wiste he by the droghte and by the reyn  
<span id="an_596"></span> The yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn.  
<span id="an_597"></span> His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye,  
<span id="an_598"></span> His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his
pultrye  
<span id="an_599"></span> Was hoolly in this Reves governynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> And by his
covenant yaf the rekenynge,  
<span id="an_601"></span> Syn that his lord was twenty yeer of age.  
<span id="an_602"></span> Ther koude no man brynge hym in arrerage.  
<span id="an_603"></span> Ther nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother
hyne,  
<span id="an_604"></span> That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne;  
<span id="an_605"></span> They were adrad of hym as of the deeth.  
<span id="an_606"></span> His wonyng was ful faire upon an heeth;  
<span id="an_607"></span> With grene trees yshadwed was his place.  
<span id="an_608"></span> He koude bettre than his lord purchace.  
<span id="an_609"></span> Ful riche he was astored pryvely.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> His lord wel
koude he plesen subtilly,  
<span id="an_611"></span> To yeve and lene hym of his owene good,  
<span id="an_612"></span> And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood.  
<span id="an_613"></span> In youthe he hadde lerned a good myster:  
<span id="an_614"></span> He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter.  
<span id="an_615"></span> This Reve sat upon a ful good stot  
<span id="an_616"></span> That was al pomely grey and highte Scot.  
<span id="an_617"></span> A long surcote of pers upon he hade,  
<span id="an_618"></span> And by his syde he baar a rusty blade.  
<span id="an_619"></span> Of Northfolk was this Reve of which I telle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> Biside a toun
men clepen Baldeswelle.  
<span id="an_621"></span> Tukked he was as is a frere aboute,  
<span id="an_622"></span> And evere he rood the hyndreste of oure
route.  
<span id="an_623"></span> A SOMONOUR was ther with us in that place,  
<span id="an_624"></span> That hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face,  
<span id="an_625"></span> For saucefleem he was, with eyen narwe.  
<span id="an_626"></span> As hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe,  
<span id="an_627"></span> With scalled browes blake and piled berd.  
<span id="an_628"></span> Of his visage children were aferd.  
<span id="an_629"></span> Ther nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> Boras,
ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon,  
<span id="an_631"></span> Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte,  
<span id="an_632"></span> That hym myghte helpen of his whelkes white,  
<span id="an_633"></span> Nor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes.  
<span id="an_634"></span> Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes,  
<span id="an_635"></span> And for to drynken strong wyn, reed as
blood;  
<span id="an_636"></span> Thanne wolde he speke and crie as he were
wood.  
<span id="an_637"></span> And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,  
<span id="an_638"></span> Thanne wolde he speke no word but Latyn.  
<span id="an_639"></span> A fewe termes hadde he, two or thre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> That he had
lerned out of som decree --  
<span id="an_641"></span> No wonder is, he herde it al the day;  
<span id="an_642"></span> And eek ye knowen wel how that a jay  
<span id="an_643"></span> Kan clepen "Watte" as wel as kan the pope.  
<span id="an_644"></span> But whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope,  
<span id="an_645"></span> Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie;  
<span id="an_646"></span> Ay "Questio quid iuris" wolde he crie.  
<span id="an_647"></span> He was a gentil harlot and a kynde;  
<span id="an_648"></span> A bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde.  

 

<span id="an_649"></span> He wolde suffre for a quart of wyn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> A good felawe
to have his concubyn  
<span id="an_651"></span> A twelf month, and excuse hym atte fulle;  
<span id="an_652"></span> Ful prively a fynch eek koude he pulle.  
<span id="an_653"></span> And if he foond owher a good felawe,  
<span id="an_654"></span> He wolde techen him to have noon awe  
<span id="an_655"></span> In swich caas of the ercedekenes curs,  
<span id="an_656"></span> But if a mannes soule were in his purs;  
<span id="an_657"></span> For in his purs he sholde ypunysshed be.  
<span id="an_658"></span> "Purs is the ercedekenes helle," seyde he.  
<span id="an_659"></span> But wel I woot he lyed right in dede;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> Of cursyng
oghte ech gilty man him drede,  
<span id="an_661"></span> For curs wol slee right as assoillyng
savith,  
<span id="an_662"></span> And also war hym of a Significavit.  
<span id="an_663"></span> In daunger hadde he at his owene gise  
<span id="an_664"></span> The yonge girles of the diocise,  
<span id="an_665"></span> And knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed.  
<span id="an_666"></span> A gerland hadde he set upon his heed,  
<span id="an_667"></span> As greet as it were for an ale-stake.  
<span id="an_668"></span> A bokeleer hadde he maad hym of a cake.  
<span id="an_669"></span> With hym ther rood a gentil PARDONER  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> Of
Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer,  
<span id="an_671"></span> That streight was comen fro the court of
Rome.  
<span id="an_672"></span> Ful loude he soong "Com hider, love, to me!"  
<span id="an_673"></span> This Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun;  
<span id="an_674"></span> Was nevere trompe of half so greet a soun.  
<span id="an_675"></span> This Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex,  
<span id="an_676"></span> But smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of
flex;  
<span id="an_677"></span> By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde,  
<span id="an_678"></span> And therwith he his shuldres overspradde;  
<span id="an_679"></span> But thynne it lay, by colpons oon and oon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> But hood, for
jolitee, wered he noon,  
<span id="an_681"></span> For it was trussed up in his walet.  
<span id="an_682"></span> Hym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet;  
<span id="an_683"></span> Dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al
bare.  
<span id="an_684"></span> Swiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare.  
<span id="an_685"></span> A vernycle hadde he sowed upon his cappe.  
<span id="an_686"></span> His walet, biforn hym in his lappe,  
<span id="an_687"></span> Bretful of pardoun comen from Rome al hoot.  
<span id="an_688"></span> A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot.  
<span id="an_689"></span> No berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> As smothe it
was as it were late shave.  
<span id="an_691"></span> I trowe he were a geldyng or a mare.  
<span id="an_692"></span> But of his craft, fro Berwyk into Ware  
<span id="an_693"></span> Ne was ther swich another pardoner.  
<span id="an_694"></span> For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer,  
<span id="an_695"></span> Which that he seyde was Oure Lady veyl;  
<span id="an_696"></span> He seyde he hadde a gobet of the seyl  
<span id="an_697"></span> That Seint Peter hadde, whan that he wente  
<span id="an_698"></span> Upon the see, til Jhesu Crist hym hente.  
<span id="an_699"></span> He hadde a croys of latoun ful of stones,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> And in a glas
he hadde pigges bones.  
<span id="an_701"></span> But with thise relikes, whan that he fond  
<span id="an_702"></span> A povre person dwellynge upon lond,  
<span id="an_703"></span> Upon a day he gat hym moore moneye  
<span id="an_704"></span> Than that the person gat in monthes tweye;  
<span id="an_705"></span> And thus, with feyned flaterye and japes,  
<span id="an_706"></span> He made the person and the peple his apes.  
<span id="an_707"></span> But trewely to tellen atte laste,  
<span id="an_708"></span> He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste.  
<span id="an_709"></span> Wel koude he rede a lessoun or a storie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> But alderbest
he song an offertorie;  
<span id="an_711"></span> For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe,  
<span id="an_712"></span> He moste preche and wel affile his tonge  
<span id="an_713"></span> To wynne silver, as he ful wel koude;  
<span id="an_714"></span> Therefore he song the murierly and loude.  
<span id="an_715"></span> Now have I toold you soothly, in a clause,  
<span id="an_716"></span> Th' estaat, th' array, the nombre, and eek the

<span id="an_717"></span> Why that assembled was this compaignye  
<span id="an_718"></span> In Southwerk at this gentil hostelrye

<span id="an_739"></span> Crist spak hymself ful brode in hooly writ,
