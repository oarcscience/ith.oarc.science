### Anelida and Arcite

<span id="an_1"></span> Thou ferse god of armes, Mars the rede,  
<span id="an_2"></span> That in the frosty contre called Trace,  
<span id="an_3"></span> Within thy grisly temple ful of drede  
<span id="an_4"></span> Honoured art as patroun of that place;  
<span id="an_5"></span> With thy Bellona, Pallas, ful of grace,  
<span id="an_6"></span> Be present and my song contynue and guye;  
<span id="an_7"></span> At my begynnyng thus to the I crye.  
<span id="an_8"></span> For hit ful depe is sonken in my mynde,  
<span id="an_9"></span> With pitous hert in Englyssh to endyte  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> This olde
storie, in Latyn which I fynde,  
<span id="an_11"></span> Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite,  
<span id="an_12"></span> That elde, which that al can frete and bite,  
<span id="an_13"></span> As hit hath freten mony a noble storie,  
<span id="an_14"></span> Hath nygh devoured out of oure memorie.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Be favorable eke, thou Polymya,  
<span id="an_16"></span> On Parnaso that with thy sustres glade,  
<span id="an_17"></span> By Elycon, not fer from Cirrea,  
<span id="an_18"></span> Singest with vois memorial in the shade,  
<span id="an_19"></span> Under the laurer which that may not fade,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> And do that I
my ship to haven wynne.  
<span id="an_21"></span> First folowe I Stace, and after him Corynne.  
<span id="an_22"></span> When Theseus with werres longe and grete  
<span id="an_23"></span> The aspre folk of Cithe had overcome,  
<span id="an_24"></span> With laurer corouned, in his char gold-bete,  
<span id="an_25"></span> Hom to his contre-houses is he come,  
<span id="an_26"></span> For which the peple, blisful al and somme,  
<span id="an_27"></span> So cryeden that to the sterres hit wente,  
<span id="an_28"></span> And him to honouren dide al her entente.  
<span id="an_29"></span> Beforn this duk, in signe of victorie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> The trompes
come, and in his baner large  
<span id="an_31"></span> The ymage of Mars, and in tokenyng of glorie  
<span id="an_32"></span> Men myghte sen of tresour many a charge,  
<span id="an_33"></span> Many a bright helm, and many a spere and
targe,  
<span id="an_34"></span> Many a fresh knyght, and many a blysful
route,  
<span id="an_35"></span> On hors, on fote, in al the feld aboute.  
<span id="an_36"></span> Ipolita his wif, the hardy quene  
<span id="an_37"></span> Of Cithia, that he conquered hadde,  
<span id="an_38"></span> With Emelye her yonge suster shene,  
<span id="an_39"></span> Faire in a char of gold he with him ladde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> That al the
ground about her char she spradde  
<span id="an_41"></span> With brightnesse of the beaute in her face,  
<span id="an_42"></span> Fulfilled of largesse and of alle grace.  
<span id="an_43"></span> With his tryumphe and laurer-corouned thus,  
<span id="an_44"></span> In al the flour of Fortunes yevynge,  
<span id="an_45"></span> Let I this noble prince Theseus  
<span id="an_46"></span> Toward Athenes in his wey rydinge,  
<span id="an_47"></span> And founde I wol in shortly for to bringe  
<span id="an_48"></span> The slye wey of that I gan to write,  
<span id="an_49"></span> Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> Mars, which
that through his furious cours of ire,  
<span id="an_51"></span> The olde wrathe of Juno to fulfille,  
<span id="an_52"></span> Hath set the peples hertes bothe on fire  
<span id="an_53"></span> Of Thebes and Grece, everich other to kille  
<span id="an_54"></span> With blody speres, ne rested never stille,  
<span id="an_55"></span> But throng now her, now ther, among hem
bothe,  
<span id="an_56"></span> That everych other slough, so were they
wrothe.  
<span id="an_57"></span> For when Amphiorax and Tydeus,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Ipomedon, Parthonope also  
<span id="an_59"></span> Were ded, and slayn proude Campaneus,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> And when the
wrecched Thebans, bretheren two,  
<span id="an_61"></span> Were slayn, and kyng Adrastus hom ago,  
<span id="an_62"></span> So desolat stod Thebes and so bare  
<span id="an_63"></span> That no wight coude remedie of his fare.  
<span id="an_64"></span> And when the olde Creon gan espye  
<span id="an_65"></span> How that the blood roial was broght a-doun,  
<span id="an_66"></span> He held the cite by his tyrannye  
<span id="an_67"></span> And dyde the gentils of that regioun  
<span id="an_68"></span> To ben his frendes and wonnen in the toun.  
<span id="an_69"></span> So, what for love of him and what for awe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> The noble folk
were to the toun idrawe.  
<span id="an_71"></span> Among al these Anelida, the quene  
<span id="an_72"></span> Of Ermony, was in that toun dwellynge,  
<span id="an_73"></span> That fairer was then is the sonne shene.  
<span id="an_74"></span> Thurghout the world so gan her name springe  
<span id="an_75"></span> That her to seen had every wyght likynge,  
<span id="an_76"></span> For, as of trouthe, is ther noon her lyche  
<span id="an_77"></span> Of al the women in this worlde riche.  
<span id="an_78"></span> Yong was this quene, of twenty yer of elde,  
<span id="an_79"></span> Of mydel stature, and of such fairenesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> That Nature had
a joye her to behelde;  
<span id="an_81"></span> And for to speken of her stidfastnesse,  
<span id="an_82"></span> She passed hath Penelope and Lucresse;  
<span id="an_83"></span> And shortly, yf she shal be comprehended,  
<span id="an_84"></span> In her ne myghte no thing been amended.  
<span id="an_85"></span> This Theban knyght Arcite eke, soth to seyn,  
<span id="an_86"></span> Was yong and therwithal a lusty knyght,  
<span id="an_87"></span> But he was double in love and no thing pleyn,  
<span id="an_88"></span> And subtil in that craft over any wyght,  
<span id="an_89"></span> And with his kunnyng wan this lady bryght;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> For so ferforth
he gan her trouthe assure  
<span id="an_91"></span> That she him trusted over any creature.  
<span id="an_92"></span> What shuld I seyn? She loved Arcite so  
<span id="an_93"></span> That when that he was absent any throwe,  
<span id="an_94"></span> Anon her thoghte her herte brast a-two;  
<span id="an_95"></span> For in her sight to her he bar hym lowe,  
<span id="an_96"></span> So that she wende have al his hert yknowe;  
<span id="an_97"></span> But he was fals; hit nas but feyned chere --  
<span id="an_98"></span> As nedeth not to men such craft to lere.  
<span id="an_99"></span> But nevertheles ful mykel besynesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> Had he er
that he myghte his lady wynne,  
<span id="an_101"></span> And swor he wolde dyen for distresse  
<span id="an_102"></span> Or from his wit he seyde he wolde twynne.  
<span id="an_103"></span> Alas, the while! For hit was routhe and
synne  
<span id="an_104"></span> That she upon his sorowes wolde rewe;  
<span id="an_105"></span> But nothing thinketh the fals as doth the
trewe.  
<span id="an_106"></span> Her fredom fond Arcite in such manere  
<span id="an_107"></span> That al was his that she hath, moche or
lyte;  
<span id="an_108"></span> Ne to no creature made she chere  
<span id="an_109"></span> Ferther then that hit lyked to Arcite.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> Ther nas no
lak with which he myghte her wite;  
<span id="an_111"></span> She was so ferforth yeven hym to plese  
<span id="an_112"></span> That al that lyked hym hit dyde her ese.  
<span id="an_113"></span> Ther nas to her no maner lettre sent  
<span id="an_114"></span> That touched love, from any maner wyght,  
<span id="an_115"></span> That she ne shewed hit him er hit was brent;  
<span id="an_116"></span> So pleyn she was and dide her fulle myght  
<span id="an_117"></span> That she nyl hiden nothing from her knyght,  
<span id="an_118"></span> Lest he of any untrouthe her upbreyde.  
<span id="an_119"></span> Withoute bode his heste she obeyde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> And eke he
made him jelous over here,  
<span id="an_121"></span> That what that any man had to her seyd  
<span id="an_122"></span> Anoon he wolde preyen her to swere  
<span id="an_123"></span> What was that word or make him evel apaid.  
<span id="an_124"></span> Then wende she out of her wyt have breyd;  
<span id="an_125"></span> But al this nas but sleght and flaterie;  
<span id="an_126"></span> Withoute love he feyned jelousye.  
<span id="an_127"></span> And al this tok she so debonerly  
<span id="an_128"></span> That al his wil her thoghte hit skilful
thing,  
<span id="an_129"></span> And ever the lenger she loved him tendirly  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> And dide him
honour as he were a kyng.  
<span id="an_131"></span> Her herte was to him wedded with a ring;  
<span id="an_132"></span> So ferforth upon trouthe is her entente  
<span id="an_133"></span> That wher he gooth her herte with him wente.  
<span id="an_134"></span> When she shal ete, on him is so her thoght  
<span id="an_135"></span> That wel unnethe of mete tok she kep;  
<span id="an_136"></span> And when that she was to her reste broght,  
<span id="an_137"></span> On him she thoghte alwey til that she slep;  
<span id="an_138"></span> When he was absent, prevely she wep:  
<span id="an_139"></span> Thus lyveth feire Anelida the quene  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> For fals
Arcite, that dide her al this tene.  
<span id="an_141"></span> This fals Arcite, of his newfanglenesse,  
<span id="an_142"></span> For she to him so lowly was and trewe,  
<span id="an_143"></span> Tok lesse deynte of her stidfastnesse  
<span id="an_144"></span> And saw another lady, proud and newe,  
<span id="an_145"></span> And ryght anon he cladde him in her hewe --  
<span id="an_146"></span> Wot I not whethir in white, rede, or grene
--  
<span id="an_147"></span> And falsed fair Anelida the quene.  
<span id="an_148"></span> But neverthelesse, gret wonder was hit noon  
<span id="an_149"></span> Thogh he were fals, for hit is kynde of man  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> Sith Lamek
was, that is so longe agoon,  
<span id="an_151"></span> To ben in love as fals as evere he can;  
<span id="an_152"></span> He was the firste fader that began  
<span id="an_153"></span> To loven two, and was in bigamye,  
<span id="an_154"></span> And he found tentes first, but yf men lye.  
<span id="an_155"></span> This fals Arcite, sumwhat moste he feyne,  
<span id="an_156"></span> When he wex fals, to covere his traitorie,  
<span id="an_157"></span> Ryght as an hors that can both bite and
pleyne,  
<span id="an_158"></span> For he bar her on honde of trecherie,  
<span id="an_159"></span> And swor he coude her doublenesse espie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> And al was
falsnes that she to him mente.  
<span id="an_161"></span> Thus swor this thef, and forth his way he
wente.  
<span id="an_162"></span> Alas, what herte myght enduren hit,  
<span id="an_163"></span> For routhe and wo, her sorwe for to telle?  
<span id="an_164"></span> Or what man hath the cunnyng or the wit?  
<span id="an_165"></span> Or what man mighte within the chambre
dwelle,  
<span id="an_166"></span> Yf I to him rehersen sholde the helle  
<span id="an_167"></span> That suffreth fair Anelida the quene  
<span id="an_168"></span> For fals Arcite, that dide her al this tene.  
<span id="an_169"></span> She wepith, waileth, swowneth pitously;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> To grounde
ded she falleth as a ston;  
<span id="an_171"></span> Craumpyssheth her lymes crokedly;  
<span id="an_172"></span> She speketh as her wit were al agon;  
<span id="an_173"></span> Other colour then asshen hath she noon;  
<span id="an_174"></span> Non other word speketh she, moche or lyte,  
<span id="an_175"></span> But \`Merci, cruel herte myn, Arcite!'  
<span id="an_176"></span> And thus endureth til that she was so mat  
<span id="an_177"></span> That she ne hath foot on which she may
sustene,  
<span id="an_178"></span> But forth languisshing evere in this estat,  
<span id="an_179"></span> Of which Arcite hath nouther routhe ne tene.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> His herte was
elleswhere, newe and grene,  
<span id="an_181"></span> That on her wo ne deyneth him not to thinke;  
<span id="an_182"></span> Him rekketh never wher she flete or synke.  
<span id="an_183"></span> His newe lady holdeth him so narowe  
<span id="an_184"></span> Up by the bridil, at the staves ende,  
<span id="an_185"></span> That every word he dredeth as an arowe;  
<span id="an_186"></span> Her daunger made him bothe bowe and bende,  
<span id="an_187"></span> And as her liste, made him turne or wende,  
<span id="an_188"></span> For she ne graunted him in her lyvynge  
<span id="an_189"></span> No grace whi that he hath lust to singe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> But drof hym
forth. Unnethe liste her knowe  
<span id="an_191"></span> That he was servaunt unto her ladishippe;  
<span id="an_192"></span> But lest that he were proud, she held him
lowe.  
<span id="an_193"></span> Thus serveth he withoute fee or shipe;  
<span id="an_194"></span> She sent him now to londe, now to shippe;  
<span id="an_195"></span> And for she yaf him daunger al his fille,  
<span id="an_196"></span> Therfor she hadde him at her owne wille.  
<span id="an_197"></span> Ensample of this, ye thrifty wymmen alle,  
<span id="an_198"></span> Take her of Anelida and Arcite,  
<span id="an_199"></span> That for her liste him \`dere herte' calle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> And was so
meke, therfor he loved her lyte.  
<span id="an_201"></span> The kynde of mannes herte is to delyte  
<span id="an_202"></span> In thing that straunge is, also God me save!  
<span id="an_203"></span> For what he may not gete, that wolde he
have.  
<span id="an_204"></span> Now turne we to Anelida ageyn,  
<span id="an_205"></span> That pyneth day be day in langwisshinge,  
<span id="an_206"></span> But when she saw that her ne gat no geyn,  
<span id="an_207"></span> Upon a day, ful sorowfully wepinge,  
<span id="an_208"></span> She caste her for to make a compleynynge,  
<span id="an_209"></span> And of her owne hond she gan hit write,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> And sente hit
to her Theban knyght, Arcite.  
<span id="an_211"></span> So thirleth with the poynt of remembraunce  
<span id="an_212"></span> The swerd of sorowe, ywhet with fals
plesaunce,  
<span id="an_213"></span> Myn herte, bare of blis and blak of hewe,  
<span id="an_214"></span> That turned is in quakyng al my daunce,  
<span id="an_215"></span> My surete in awhaped countenaunce,  
<span id="an_216"></span> Sith hit availeth not for to ben trewe;  
<span id="an_217"></span> For whoso trewest is, hit shal hir rewe  
<span id="an_218"></span> That serveth love and doth her observaunce  
<span id="an_219"></span> Alwey til oon, and chaungeth for no newe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> I wot myself
as wel as any wight,  
<span id="an_221"></span> For I loved oon with al myn herte and myght,  
<span id="an_222"></span> More then myself an hundred thousand sithe,  
<span id="an_223"></span> And called him myn hertes lif, my knyght,  
<span id="an_224"></span> And was al his, as fer as hit was ryght;  
<span id="an_225"></span> And when that he was glad, then was I
blithe,  
<span id="an_226"></span> And his disese was my deth as swithe;  
<span id="an_227"></span> And he ayein his trouthe hath me plyght  
<span id="an_228"></span> For evermore, his lady me to kythe.  
<span id="an_229"></span> Now is he fals, alas, and causeles,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> And of my wo
he is so routheles  
<span id="an_231"></span> That with a word him list not ones deyne  
<span id="an_232"></span> To bringe ayen my sorowful herte in pes,  
<span id="an_233"></span> For he is caught up in another les.  
<span id="an_234"></span> Ryght as him list, he laugheth at my peyne,  
<span id="an_235"></span> And I ne can myn herte not restreyne  
<span id="an_236"></span> For to love him alwey neveretheles;  
<span id="an_237"></span> And of al this I not to whom me pleyne.  
<span id="an_238"></span> And shal I pleyne -- alas, the harde stounde!
--  
<span id="an_239"></span> Unto my foo that yaf myn herte a wounde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> And yet
desireth that myn harm be more?  
<span id="an_241"></span> Nay, certis, ferther wol I never founde  
<span id="an_242"></span> Non other helpe, my sores for to sounde.  
<span id="an_243"></span> My destinee hath shapen hit so ful yore;  
<span id="an_244"></span> I wil non other medecyne ne lore;  
<span id="an_245"></span> I wil ben ay ther I was ones bounde.  
<span id="an_246"></span> That I have seid, be seid for evermore!  
<span id="an_247"></span> Alas! Wher is become your gentilesse,  
<span id="an_248"></span> Youre wordes ful of plesaunce and humblesse,  
<span id="an_249"></span> Youre observaunces in so low manere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> And your

<span id="an_251"></span> Upon me, that ye calden your maistresse,  
<span id="an_252"></span> Your sovereyne lady in this world here?  
<span id="an_253"></span> Alas! Is ther now nother word ne chere  
<span id="an_254"></span> Ye vouchen sauf upon myn hevynesse?  
<span id="an_255"></span> Alas! Youre love, I bye hit al to dere.  
<span id="an_256"></span> Now, certis, swete, thogh that ye

<span id="an_263"></span> That al wot, out of wo my soule quyte!  
<span id="an_264"></span> But for I shewed yow, Arcite,  
<span id="an_265"></span> Al that men wolde to me write,  
<span id="an_266"></span> And was so besy yow to delyte --  
<span id="an_267"></span> Myn honor save -- meke, kynde, and fre,  
<span id="an_268"></span> Therfor ye put on me this wite,  
<span id="an_269"></span> And of me rekke not a myte,

<span id="an_279"></span> And than shal this, that now is mys, be
game,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> And al

<span id="an_281"></span> Lo, herte myn, al this is for to seyne  
<span id="an_282"></span> As whether shal I preye or elles pleyne?  
<span id="an_283"></span> Which is the wey to doon yow to be trewe?  
<span id="an_284"></span> For either mot I have yow in my cheyne

<span id="an_291"></span> Myself I mordre with my privy thoght;  
<span id="an_292"></span> For sorowe and routhe of your unkyndenesse  
<span id="an_293"></span> I wepe, I wake, I faste; al helpeth noght;  
<span id="an_294"></span> I weyve joye that is to speke of oght,  
<span id="an_295"></span> I voyde companye, I fle gladnesse.  
<span id="an_296"></span> Who may avaunte her beter of hevynesse  
<span id="an_297"></span> Then I? And to this plyte have ye me broght,  
<span id="an_298"></span> Withoute gilt -- me nedeth no witnesse.

<span id="an_301"></span> And axe merci, gilteles -- what nede?  
<span id="an_302"></span> And yf I pleyne what lyf that I lede,  
<span id="an_303"></span> Yow rekketh not; that knowe I, out of drede;  
<span id="an_304"></span> And if that I to yow myne othes bede  
<span id="an_305"></span> For myn excuse, a skorn shal be my mede.  
<span id="an_306"></span> Your chere floureth, but it wol not sede;  
<span id="an_307"></span> Ful longe agoon I oghte have taken hede.  
<span id="an_308"></span> For thogh I hadde yow to-morowe ageyn,  
<span id="an_309"></span> I myghte as wel holde Aperill fro reyn

to make yow be stidfast.  
<span id="an_311"></span> Almyghty God, of trouthe sovereyn,  
<span id="an_312"></span> Wher is the trouthe of man? Who hath hit
slayn?  
<span id="an_313"></span> Who that hem loveth, she shal hem fynde as
fast  
<span id="an_314"></span> As in a tempest is a roten mast.  
<span id="an_315"></span> Is that a tame best that is ay feyn  
<span id="an_316"></span> To fleen away when he is lest agast?  
<span id="an_317"></span> Now merci, swete, yf I mysseye!  
<span id="an_318"></span> Have I seyd oght amys, I preye?  
<span id="an_319"></span> I noot; my wit is al aweye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> I fare as
doth the song of Chaunte-pleure;  
<span id="an_321"></span> For now I pleyne, and now I pleye;  
<span id="an_322"></span> I am so mased that I deye;  
<span id="an_323"></span> Arcite hath born awey the keye  
<span id="an_324"></span> Of al my world, and my good aventure.  
<span id="an_325"></span> For in this world nis creature  
<span id="an_326"></span> Wakynge in more discomfiture  
<span id="an_327"></span> Then I, ne more sorowe endure.  
<span id="an_328"></span> And yf I slepe a furlong wey or tweye,  
<span id="an_329"></span> Then thynketh me that your figure  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> Before me
stont, clad in asure,  
<span id="an_331"></span> To profren eft and newe assure  
<span id="an_332"></span> For to be trewe, and merci me to preye.  
<span id="an_333"></span> The longe nyght this wonder sight I drye,  
<span id="an_334"></span> And on the day for thilke afray I dye,  
<span id="an_335"></span> And of al this ryght noght, iwis, ye reche.  
<span id="an_336"></span> Ne nevere mo myn yen two be drie,  
<span id="an_337"></span> And to your routhe, and to your trouthe, I
crie.  
<span id="an_338"></span> But welawey! To fer be they to feche;  
<span id="an_339"></span> Thus holdeth me my destinee a wreche.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> But me to
rede out of this drede, or guye,  
<span id="an_341"></span> Ne may my wit, so weyk is hit, not streche.  
<span id="an_342"></span> Then ende I thus, sith I may do no more.  
<span id="an_343"></span> I yeve hit up for now and evermore,  
<span id="an_344"></span> For I shal never eft putten in balaunce  
<span id="an_345"></span> My sekernes, ne lerne of love the lore.  
<span id="an_346"></span> But as the swan, I have herd seyd ful yore,  
<span id="an_347"></span> Ayeins his deth shal singen his penaunce,  
<span id="an_348"></span> So singe I here my destinee or chaunce,  
<span id="an_349"></span> How that Arcite Anelida so sore  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> Hath thirled
with the poynt of remembraunce.  
<span id="an_351"></span> When that Anelida, this woful quene,  
<span id="an_352"></span> Hath of her hand ywriten in this wise,  
<span id="an_353"></span> With face ded, betwixe pale and grene,  
<span id="an_354"></span> She fel a-swowe; and sith she gan to rise,  
<span id="an_355"></span> And unto Mars avoweth sacrifise  
<span id="an_356"></span> Withinne the temple, with a sorowful chere,  
<span id="an_357"></span> That shapen was as ye shal after here....??
