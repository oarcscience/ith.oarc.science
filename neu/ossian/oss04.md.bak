A

DISSERTATION

CONCERNING

THE ÆRA OF OSSIAN.

INQUIRIES into the antiquities of nations afford more pleasure than any
real advantage to mankind. The ingenious may form systems of history on
probabilities and a few facts; but, at a great distance of time, their
accounts must be vague and uncertain. The infancy of states and kingdoms
is as destitute of great events, as of the means of transmitting them to
posterity. The arts of polished life, by which alone facts can be
preserved with certainty, are the production of a well. formed
community. It is then historians begin to write, and public transactions
to be worthy remembrance. The actions of former times are left in
obscurity, or magnified by uncertain traditions. Hence it is that we
find so much of the marvellous in the origin of every nation; posterity
being always ready to believe any thing, however fabulous, that reflects
honor on their ancestors.

The Greeks and Romans were remarkable for this weakness. They swallowed
the most absurd fables concerning the high antiquities of their
respective nations. Good historians, however, rose very early

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

amongst them, and transmitted, with lustre, their great actions to
posterity. It is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now
enjoy; while the great actions of other nations are involved in fables,
or lost in obscurity. The Celtic nations afford a striking instance of
this kind. They, though once the masters of Europe, from the mouth of
the river Oby, in Russia, to Cape Finisterre, the western point of
Gallicia, in Spain, are very little mentioned in history. They trusted
their fame to tradition and the songs of their bards, which, by the
vicissitude of human affairs, are long since lost. Their ancient
language is the only monument that remains of them; and the traces of it
being found in places so widely distant from each other, serves only to
show the extent of their ancient power, but throws very little light on
their history.

Of all the Celtic nations, that which possessed old Gaul is the most
renowned: not perhaps on account of worth superior to the rest, but for
their wars with a people who had historians to transmit the fame of
their enemies, as well as their own, to posterity. Britain was first
peopled by them, according to the testimony of the best authors; its
situation in respect to Gaul makes the opinion probable; but what puts
it beyond all dispute, is, that the same customs and language prevailed
among the inhabitants of both in the days of Julius Cæsar.

The colony from Gaul possessed themselves, at first, of that part of
Britain which was next to their own country; and spreading northward by
degrees, as they increased in numbers, peopled the whole island. Some
adventurers passing over from those parts of Britain that are within
sight of Ireland, were the founders of the Irish nation: which is a more
probable story than the idle fables of Milesian and Gallician colonies.
Diodorus Siculus mentions it as a thing well k-town in

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

his time, that the inhabitants of Ireland were originally Britons; and
his testimony is unquestionable, when we consider that, for many ages,
the language and customs of both nations were the same.

Tacitus was of opinion that the ancient Caledonians were of German
extract; but even the ancient Ger. mans themselves were Gauls. The
present Germans, properly so called, were not the same with the ancient
Celtæ. The manners and customs of the two nations were similar; but
their language different. The Germans are the genuine descendants of the
ancient Scandinavians, who crossed, at an early period, the Baltic. The
Celtæ, anciently, sent many colonies into Germany, all of whom retained
their own laws, language, and customs, till they were dissipated, in the
Roman empire; and it is of them, if any colonies came from Germany into
Scotland, that the ancient Caledonians were descended.

But whether the ancient Caledonians were a colony of the Celtic
Germans,, or the same with the Gauls that first possessed themselves of
Britain, is a matter of no moment at this distance of time. Whatever
their origin was, we find them very numerous in the time of Julius
Agricola, which is a presumption that they were long before settled in
the country. The form of their government was a mixture of aristocracy
and monarchy, as it was in all the countries where the Druids bore the
chief sway. This order of men seems to have been formed on the same
principles with the Dactyli, Idæ, and Curetes of the ancients. Their
pretended intercourse with heaven, their magic and divination, were the
same. The knowledge of the Druids in natural causes, and the properties
of certain things, the fruits of the experiments of ages, gained them a
mighty reputation among the people. The esteem of the populace soon
increased into a veneration for the order;

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

which these cunning and ambitious priests took care to improve, to such
a degree, that they, in a manner, engrossed the management of civil, as
well as religious matters. It is generally allowed, that they did not
abuse this extraordinary power; the preserving the character of sanctity
was so essential to their influence, that they never broke out into
violence or oppression. The chiefs were allowed to execute the laws, but
the legislative power was entirely in the hands of the Druids. It Was by
their authority that the tribes were united, in times of the greatest
danger, under one head. This temporary king, or Vergobretus, was chosen
by them, and generally laid down his office at the end of the war. These
priests enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the Celtic
nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the
beginning of the second century that their power among the Caledonians
began to decline. The traditions concerning Trathal and Cormac,
ancestors to Fingal, are full of the particulars of the fall of the
Druids: a singular fate it must be owned, of priests who had once
established their superstition.

The continual wars of the Caledonians against the Romans, hindered the
bettor sort from initiating themselves, as the custom formerly was, into
the order of the Druids. The precepts of their religion were con. fined
to a few, and were not much attended to by a people inured to war. He
Vergobretus, or chief magistrate, was chosen without the concurrence of
the hierarchy, or continued in his office against their will. Continual
power strengthened his interest among the tribes, and enabled him to
send down, as hereditary to his posterity, the office he had only
received himself by election.

On occasion of a new war against the "king of the world," as tradition
emphatically calls the Roman emperor,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

the Druids, to vindicate the honor of the order, began to resume their
ancient privilege of choosing the Vergobretus. Garmal, the son of Tarno,
being deputed by them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal,
who was then Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole
order, to lay down his office. Upon his refusal, a civil war commenced,
which soon ended in almost the total extinction of the religious order
of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark recesses of
their groves, and the caves they had formerly used for their
meditations. It is then we find them in the circle of stones, and
unheeded by the world. A total disregard for the order, and utter
abhorrence of the Druidical rites ensued. Under this cloud of public
hate, all that had any knowledge of the religion of the Druids became
extinct, and the nation fell into the last degree of ignorance of their
rites and ceremonies.

It is no matter of wonder, then, that Fingal and his son Ossian disliked
the Druids, who were the declared enemies to their succession in the
supreme magistracy. It is a singular case, it must be allowed, that
there are no traces of religion in the poems ascribed to Ossian, as the
poetical compositions of other nations are so closely connected with
their mythology. But gods are not necessary, when the poet has genius.
It is hard to account for it to those who are not made acquainted with
the manner of the old Scottish bards. That race of men carried their
notions of martial honor to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their
heroes in battle, was thought to derogate from their fame; and the bards
immediately transferred the glory of the action to him who had given
that aid.

Had the poet brought down gods, as often as Homer has done, to assist
his heroes, his work had not consisted of eulogiums on men, but of hymns
to superior

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

beings. Those who write in the Gaelic language seldom mention religion
in their profane poetry; and when they professedly write of religion,
they never mix, with their compositions, the actions of their heroes.
This custom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not
[been been](errata.htm#1.md) previously extinguished, may, in some measure,
excuse the author's silence concerning the religion of ancient times.

To allege that a nation is void of all religion, betrays ignorance of
the history of mankind. The traditions of their fathers, and their own
observations on the works of nature, together with that superstition
which is inherent in the human frame, have, in all ages, raised in the
minds of men some idea of a superior being. Hence it is, that in the
darkest times, and amongst the most barbarous nations, the very populace
themselves hid some faint notion, at least, of a divinity. The Indians,
who worship no God, believe that he exists. It would be doing injustice
to the author of these poems, to think that he had not opened his
conceptions to that primitive and greatest of all truths. But let his
religion be what it will, it is certain that he has not alluded to
Christianity or any of its rites, in his poems; which ought to fix his
opinions, at least; to an era prior to that religion. Conjectures, on
this subject, must supply the place of proof. The persecution begun by
Dioclesian, in the year 303, is the most probable time in which the
first dawning of Christianity in the north of Britain can be fixed. The
humane and mild character of Constantius Chlorus, who commanded then in
Britain, induced the persecuted Christians to take refuge under him.
Some of them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear,
went beyond the pale of the Roman empire, and settled among the
Caledonians; who were, ready to hearken to their doctrines, if the
religion of the Druids was exploded long before.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

These missionaries, either through choice or to give more weight to the
doctrine they advanced, took possession of the cells and groves of the
Druids; and it was from this retired life they had the name of Culdees,
which, in the language of the country, signified "the sequestered
persons." It was with one of the Culdees that Ossian, in his extreme old
age, is said to have disputed concerning the Christian religion. This
dispute they say, is extant, and is couched in verse, according to the
custom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of Ossian of the
Christian tenets, shows that that religion had only lately been
introduced, as it is not easy to conceive how one of the first rank
could be totally unacquainted with a religion that had been known for
any time in the country. The dispute bears the genuine marks of
antiquity. The obsolete phrases and expressions, peculiar to the time,
prove it to be no forgery. If Ossian, then, lived at the introduction of
Christianity, as by all appearance he did, his epoch will be the, latter
end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. Tradition here
steps in with a kind of proof.

The exploits of Fingal against Caracul, the son of the "king of the
world," are among the first brave actions of his youth. A complete:
poem, which relates to this subject, is printed in this collection.

In the year 210, the Emperor Severus, after returning from his
expedition against the Caledonians at York, fell into the tedious
illness of which he afterward died. The Caledonians and Maiatæ, resuming
courage from his indisposition, took arms in order to recover the
possessions they had lost. The enraged emperor commanded his army to
march into their country, and to destroy it with fire and sword. His
orders were but ill executed; for his son Caracalla was at the head of
the army, and his thoughts were entirely

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

taken up with the hopes of his father's death, and with schemes to
supplant his brother Geta. He scarcely had entered into the enemy's
country, when news was brought him that Severus was dead, A sudden peace
is patched up with the Caledonians, and, as it appears from Dion
Cassius, the country they had lost to Severus was restored to them.

The Caracul of Fingal is no other than Caracalla, who as the son of
Severus, the emperor of Rome, whose dominions were extended almost over
the known world, was not without reason called the "son of the king of
the world." The space, of time between 211, the year Severus , died, and
the beginning of the fourth century is not so great, but Ossian, the son
of Fingal, might have seen the Christians whom the persecution under
Dioclesian had driven beyond the pale of the Roman empire.

In one of the many lamentations of the death of Oscar, a battle which he
fought, against Caros, king of ships, on the banks of the winding Carun,
is mentioned among his great actions. It is more than probable, that the
Caros mentioned here, is the same with the noted usurper Carausius, who
assumed the purple in the year 287, and seizing on Britain, defeated the
Emperor Maximinian Herculius in several naval engagements, which gives
propriety to his being called the "king of ships." "The winding Carun,"
is that small river retaining still the name of Carron, and runs in the
neighborhood of Agricola's wall, which Carausius repaired, to obstruct
the incursions of the Caledonians. Several other passages in traditions
allude to the wars of the Romans; but the two just mentioned clearly fix
the epocha of Fingal to the third century; and this account agrees
exactly with the Irish histories, which place the death of Fingal, the
son of Comhal, in

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the year 283, and that of Oscar and their own celebrated Cairbre, in the
year 296.

Some people may imagine, that the allusions to the Roman history might
have been derived by tradition, from learned men, more than from ancient
poems. This must then have happened at least three hundred years ago, as
these allusions are mentioned often in the compositions of those times.

Every one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbarism overspread the
north of Europe three hundred years ago. The minds of men, addicted to
superstition, contracted a narrowness that destroyed genius. Accordingly
we find the compositions of those times trivial and puerile to the last
degree. But, let it be allowed; that, amidst all the untoward
circumstances of the age, a genius might arise; it is not easy to
determine what could induce him to allude to the Roman times. We find no
fact to favor any designs which could be entertained by any man who
lived in the fifteenth century.

The strongest objection to the antiquity of the poems now given to the
public under the name of Ossian, is the improbability of their being
handed down by tradition through so many centuries. Ages of barbarism
some will say, could not produce poems abounding with the disinterested
and generous sentiments so conspicuous in the compositions of Ossian;
and could these ages produce them, it is impossible but they must be
lost, or altogether corrupted, in a long succession of barbarous
generations.

Those objections naturally suggest themselves to men unacquainted with
the ancient state of the northern parts of Britain. The bards, who were
an inferior order of the Druids, did not share their bad fortune. They
were spared by the victorious king, as it was through their means only
he could hope for immortality

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

to his fame. They attended him in the camp, and contributed to establish
his power by their songs. His great actions were magnified, and the
populace, who had no ability to examine into his character narrowly,
were dazzled with his fame in the rhymes of the bards. In the mean time,
men assumed sentiments that are rarely to be met with in an age of
barbarism. The bards, who were originally the disciples of the Druids,
hid their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated
into the learning of that celebrated order. They could form a perfect
hero in their own minds, and ascribe that character to their prince. The
inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct;
and, by degrees, brought their minds to that generous spirit which
breathes in all the poetry of the times. The prince, flattered by his
bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his character as
described in the eulogies of his poets, endeavored to excel his people
in merit, as he was above them in station. This emulation continuing,
formed at last the general character of the nation, happily compounded
of what is noble in barbarity, and virtuous and generous in a polished
people.

When virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteristics of a
nation, their actions become interesting, and their fame worthy of
immortality. A generous spirit is warmed with noble actions, and becomes
ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true source of that divine
inspiration, to which the poets of all ages pretended. When they found
their themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they
varnished them over with fables supplied with their own fancy, or
furnished by absurd traditions. These fables, however ridiculous, had
their abettors; posterity either implicitly believed them, or through a
vanity natural to mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

place the founders of their families in the days of fable, when poetry,
without the fear of contradiction, could give what character she pleased
of her heroes. It is to this vanity that we owe the preservation of what
remain of the more ancient poems. Their poetical merit made their heroes
famous in a country where heroism was much esteemed and admired. The
posterity of these heroes or those who pretended to be descended from
them, heard with pleasure the eulogiums of their ancestors; bards were
employed to repeat the poems, and to record the connection of their
patrons with chiefs so renowned. Every chief, in process of time, had a
bard in his family, and the office became at last hereditary. By the
succession of these bards, the poems concerning the ancestors of the
family were handed down from generation to generation; they were
repeated to the whole clan on solemn occasions, and always alluded to in
the new compositions of the bards. The custom came down to near our own
times; and after the bards were discontinued, a great number in a clan
retained by memory, or committed to writing, their compositions, and
founded the antiquity of their families on the authority of their poems.

The use of letters was not known in the north of Europe till long after
the institution of the bards: the records of the families of their
patrons, their own, and more ancient poems, were handed down by
tradition. Their poetical compositions were admirably contrived for that
purpose. They were adapted to music; and the most perfect harmony was
observed. Each verse was so connected with those which preceded or
followed it, that if one line, had been remembered in a stanza, it was
almost impossible to forget the rest. The cadences followed so natural a
gradation, and the words were so adapted to the common turn of the
voice, after it is

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

raised to a certain key, that it was almost impossible, from a
similarity of sound, to substitute one word for another. This excellence
is peculiar to the Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no
other language. Nor does this choice of words clog the sense, or weaken
the expression. The numerous flexions of consonants, and variation in
declension, make the language very copious.

The descendants of the Celtæ, who inhabited Britain and its isles, were
not singular in this method of preserving the most precious monuments of
their nation. The ancient laws of the Greeks were couched in verse, and
handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a long habit, became so
fond of this custom, that they would never allow their laws to be
committed to writing. The actions of great men, and eulogiums of kings
and heroes, were preserved in the same manner. All the historical
monuments of the old Germans were comprehended in their ancient songs;
which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in praise of their
heroes, and were intended to perpetuate the great events in their
nation, which were carefully interwoven with them. This species of
composition was not committed to writing, but delivered by oral
tradition. The care they took to have the poems taught to their
children, the uninterrupted custom of repeating them upon certain
occasions, and the happy measure of the verse, served to preserve them
for a long time uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not
forgot in the eighth century; and it probably would have remained to
this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing that is not
committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical
traditions that Garcilasso composed his account of the Incas of Peru.
The Peruvians had lost all other monuments of their history, and it was
from ancient poems, which his mother,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

a princess of the blood of the Incas, taught him in his youth, that he,
collected the materials of his history. If other nations, then, that had
often been overrun by enemies, and hath sent abroad and received
colonies, could for many ages preserve, by oral tradition, their laws
and histories uncorrupted, it is much more probable that the ancient
Scots, a people so free of intermixture with foreigners, and so strongly
attached to the memory of their ancestors, had the works of their bards
handed down with great purity.

What is advanced in s short dissertation, it must be confessed, is mere
conjecture. Beyond the reach of' records is settled a gloom which no
ingenuity can penetrate. The manners described in these poems suit the
ancient Celtic times, and no other period that is known in history. We
must, therefore, place the heroes far back in antiquity; and it matters
little, who were their contemporaries in other parts of the world. If we
have placed Fingal in his proper period, we do honor to the manners of
barbarous times. He exercised every manly virtue in Caledonia, while
Heliogabalus disgraced human nature at Rome.
