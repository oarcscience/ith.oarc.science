# FINGAL

### BOOK III  <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

### ARGUMENT.

Cuthullin, pleased with the story of Carril, insists with that bard for
more of his songs. He relates the actions of Fingal in Lochlin, and
death of Agandecca, the beautiful sister of Swaran. He had scarce
finished, when Calmar, the son of Matha, who had advised the first
battle, came wounded from the field, and told them of Swaran's design to
surprise the remains of the Irish army. He himself proposes to withstand
singly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow pass, till the Irish
should make good their retreat. Cuthullin, touched with the gallant
proposal of Calmar, resolves to accompany him and orders Carril to carry
off the few that remained of the Irish. Morning comes, Calmar dies of
his wounds; and the ships of the Caledonians appearing, Swaran gives
over the pursuit of the Irish, and returns to oppose Fingal's landing.
Cuthullin, ashamed, after his defeat, to appear before Fingal re tires
to the cave of Tura. Fingal engages the enemy, puts them to flight: but
the coming on of night makes the victory not decisive. The king, who had
observed the gallant behavior of his grandson Oscar, gives him advice
concerning his conduct in peace and war. He recommends to him to place
the example of his fathers before his eyes, as the best model for his
conduct; which introduces the episode concerning Fainasóllis, the
daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had taken under his
protection in his youth. Fillan and Oscar are despatched to observe the
motions of the enemy by night: Gaul, the son of Morni, desires the
command of the army in the next battle, which Fingal promises to give
him. Some general reflections of the poet close the third day.

"PLEASANT are the words of the song! "said Cuthullin, "lovely the tales
of other times! They are like the calm dew of the morning on the hill of
roes! when the sun is faint on its side, and the lake is settled and
blue on the vale. O Carril, raise again thy voice! let me hear the song
of Selma: which was sung in my

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

halls of joy, when Fingal, king of shields, was there, and glowed at the
deeds of his fathers.

"Fingal! thou dweller of battle," said Carril, "early were thy deeds in
arms. Lochlin was consumed in thy wrath, when thy youth strove in the
beauty of maids. They smiled at the fair-blooming face of the hero; but
death was in his hands. He was strong as the waters of Lora. His
followers were the roar of a thousand streams. They took the king of
Lochlin in war; they restored him to his ship. His big heart swelled
with pride; the death of the youth was dark in his soul. For none ever
but Fingal, had overcome the strength of the mighty Starno. He sat in
the hall of his shells in Lochlin's woody land. He called the
gray-haired Snivan, that often sung round the circle  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) of Loda; when the stone of power heard his
voice, and battle turned in the field of the valiant!

"'Go, gray-haired Snivan,' Starno said: 'go to Ardven's sea-surrounded
rocks. Tell to the king of Selma; he the fairest among his thousands;
tell him I give to him my daughter, the loveliest maid that ever heaved
a breast of snow. Her arms are white as the foam of my waves. Her soul
is generous and mild. Let him come with his bravest heroes to the
daughter of the secret hall!' Snivan came to Selma's hall: fair-haired
Fingal attended his steps. His kindled soul flew to the maid, as he
bounded on the waves of the north. 'Welcome,' said the dark-brown
Starno, 'welcome, king of rocky Morven! welcome his heroes of might,
sons of the distant isle! Three days within thy halls shall we feast;
three days pursue my boars; that your fame may reach the maid who dwells
in the secret hall.'

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

"Starno designed their death. He gave the feast of shells. Fingal, who
doubted the foe, kept on his arms of steel. The sons of death were
afraid: they fled from the eyes of the king. The voice of sprightly
mirth arose. The trembling harps of joy were strung. Bards sung the
battles of heroes; they sung the heaving breast of love. Ullin, Fingal's
bard, was there: the sweet voice of resounding Cona. He praised the
daughter of Lochlin; and Morven's  <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)
high-descended chief. The daughter of Lochlin overheard. She left the
hall of her secret sigh! She came in all her beauty, like the moon from
the cloud of the east. Loveliness was round her as light. Her steps were
the music of songs. She saw the youth and loved him. He was the stolen
sigh of her soul. Her blue eyes rolled on him in secret: she blessed the
chief of resounding Morven.

"The third day, with all its beams, shone bright on the wood of boars.
Forth moved the dark-browed Starno; and Fingal, king of shields. Half
the day they spent in the chase; the spear of Selma was red in blood. It
was then the daughter of Starno, with blue eyes rolling in tears; it was
then she came with her voice of love, and spoke to the king of Morven.
'Fingal, high-descended chief, trust not Starno's heart of pride. Within
that wood he has placed his chiefs. Beware of the wood of death. But
remember, son of the isle, remember Agandecca; save me from the wrath of
my father, king of the windy Morven!'

"The youth with unconcern went on; his heroes by his side. The sons of
death fell by his hand; and Gormal echoed around! Before the halls of
Starno the sons of the chase convened. The king's dark brows

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

were like clouds; his eyes like meteors of night. 'Bring hither,' he
said, 'Agandecca to her lovely king of Morven! His hand is stained with
the blood of my people; her words have not been in vain!' She came with
the red eye of tears. She came with loosely flowing locks. Her white
breast heaved with broken sighs, like the foam of the streamy Lubar.
Starno pierced her side with steel. She fell, like a wreath of snow,
which slides from the rocks of Ronan, when the woods are still, and echo
deepens in the vale! Then Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs: his valiant
chiefs took arms! The gloom of battle roared: Lochlin fled or died. Pale
in his bounding ship he closed the maid of the softest soul. Her tomb
ascends on Ardven; the sea roars round her narrow dwelling."

"Blessed be her soul," said Cuthullin; "blessed be the mouth of the
song! Strong was the youth of Fingal; strong is his arm of age. Lochlin
shall fall again before the king of echoing Morven. Show thy face from a
cloud, O moon! light his white sails on the wave: and if any strong
spirit of heaven sits on that low-hung cloud; turn his dark ships from
the rock, thou rider of the storm!"

Such were the words of Cuthullin at the sound of the mountain stream;
when Calmar ascended the hill, the wounded son of Matha. From the field
he came in his blood. He leaned on his bending spear. Feeble is the arm
of battle! but strong the soul of the hero! "Welcome! O son of Matha,"
said Connal, "welcome art thou to thy friends! Why bursts that broken
sigh from the breast of him who never feared before?" "And never,
Connal, will he fear, chief of the pointed steel! My soul brightens in
danger; in the noise of arms I am of the race of battle. My fathers
never feared.

"Cormar was the first of my race. He sported

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

through the storms of waves. His black skiff bounded on ocean; he
travelled on the wings of the wind. A spirit once embroiled the night.
Seas swell and rocks resound. Winds drive along the clouds. The
lightning flies on wings of fire. He feared, and came to land, then
blushed that he feared at all. He rushed again among the waves, to find
the son of the wind. Three youths guide the bounding bark: he stood with
sword unsheathed. When the low-hung vapor passed, he took it by the
curling head. He searched its dark womb with his steel. The son of the
wind forsook the air. The moon and the stars returned! Such was the
boldness of my race. Calmar is like his fathers. Danger flies from the
lifted sword. They best succeed who dare!

"But now, ye sons of green Erin, retire from Lena's bloody heath.
Collect the sad remnant of our friends, and join the sword of Fingal. I
heard the sound of Lochlin's advancing arms: Calmar will remain and
fight. My voice shall be such, my friends, as if thousands were behind
me. But, son of Semo, remember me. Remember Calmar's lifeless corse.
When Fingal shall have wasted the field, place me by some stone of
remembrance, that future times may hear my fame; that the mother of
Calmar may rejoice in my renown."

"No: son of Matha," said Cuthullin, "I will never leave thee here. My
joy is in an unequal fight: my soul increases in danger. Connal, and
Carril of other times, carry off the sad sons of Erin. When the battle
is over, search for us in this narrow way. For near this oak we shall
fall, in the streams of the battle of thousands! O Fithal's son, with
flying speed rush over the heath of Lena. Tell to Fingal that Erin is
fallen. Bid the king of Morven come. O let him come like the sun in a
storm, to lighten, to restore the isle!"

Morning is gray on Cromla. The sons of the sea

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

ascend. Calmar stood forth to meet them in the pride of his kindling
soul. But pale was the face of the chief. He leaned on his father's
spear. That spear which he brought from Lara, when the soul of his
mother was sad; the soul of the lonely Alcletha, waning in the sorrow of
years. But slowly now the hero falls, like a tree on the plain. Dark
Cuthullin stands alone like a rock in a sandy vale. The sea comes with
its waves, and roars on its hardened sides. Its head is covered with
foam; the hills are echoing round.

Now from the gray mist of the ocean the white-sailed ships of Fingal
appear. High is the grove of their masts, as they nod, by turns, on the
rolling wave. Swaran saw them from the hill. He returned from the sons
of Erin. As ebbs the resounding sea, through the hundred isles of
Inistore; so loud, so vast, so immense, returned the sons of Lochlin
against the king. But bending, weeping, sad, and slow, and dragging his
long spear behind, Cuthullin sunk in Cromla's wood, and mourned his
fallen friends. He feared the face of Fingal, who was wont to greet him
from the fields of renown!

"How many lie there of my heroes! the chiefs of Erin's race! they that
were cheerful in the hall, when the sound of the shells arose! No more
shall I find their steps in the heath! No more shall I hear their voice
in the chase. Pale, silent, low on bloody beds, are they who were my
friends! O spirits of the lately dead, meet Cuthullin on his heath!
Speak to him on the winds, when the rustling tree of Tura's cave
resounds. There, far remote, I shall lie unknown. No bard shall hear of
me. No gray stone shall rise to my renown. Mourn me with the dead, O
Bragéla! departed is my fame." Such were the words of Cuthullin, when he
sunk in the woods of Cromla!

Fingal, tall in his ship, stretched his bright lance

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

before him. Terrible was the gleam of his steel: It was like the green
meteor of death, setting in the heath of Malmor, when the traveller is
alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.

"The battle is past," said the king. "I behold the blood of my friends.
Sad is the heath of Lena! mournful the oaks of Cromla! The hunters have
fallen in their strength: the son of Semo is no more! Ryno and Fillan,
my sons, sound the horn of Fingal! Ascend that hill on the shore; call
the children of the foe. Call them from the grave of Lamderg, the chief
of other times. Be your voice like that of your father, when he enters
the battles of his strength! I wait for the mighty stranger. I wait on
Lena's shore for Swaran. Let him come with all his race; strong in
battle are the friends of the dead!"

Fair Ryno as lightning gleamed along: dark Fillan rushed like the shade
of autumn. On Lena's heath their voice is heard. The sons of ocean heard
the horn of Fingal. As the roaring eddy of ocean returning from the
kingdom of snows: so strong, so dark, so sudden, came down the sons of
Lochlin. The king in their front appears, in the dismal pride of his
arms! Wrath burns on his dark-brown face; his eyes roll in the fire of
his valor. Fingal beheld the son of Starno: he remembered Agandecca. For
Swaran with tears of youth had mourned his white-bosomed sister. He sent
Ullin of songs to bid him to the feast of shells: for pleasant on
Fingal's soul returned the memory of the first of his loves!

Ullin came with aged steps, and spoke to Starno's son. "O thou that
dwellest afar, surrounded, like a rock, with thy waves! come to the
feast of the king, and pass the day in rest. To-morrow let us fight, O
Swaran, and break the echoing

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

shields."--"To-day," said Starno's wrathful son, "we break the echoing
shields: to-morrow my feast shall be spread; but Fingal shall lie on
earth."--"To-morrow let his feast be spread," said Fingal, with a smile.
"To-day, O my sons! we shall break the echoing shields. Ossian, stand
thou near my arm. Gaul, lift thy terrible sword. Fergus, bend thy
crooked yew. Throw, Fillan, thy lance through heaven. Lift your shields,
like the darkened moon. Be your spears the meteors of death. Follow me
in the path of my fame. Equal my deeds in battle."

As a hundred winds on Morven; as the streams of a hundred hills; as
clouds fly successive over heaven; as the dark ocean assails the shore
of the desert: so roaring, so vast, so terrible, the armies mixed on
Lena's echoing heath. The groans of the people spread over the hills: it
was like the thunder of night, when the cloud bursts on Cona; and a
thousand ghosts shriek at once on the hollow wind. Fingal rushed on in
his strength, terrible as the spirit of Trenmor; when in a whirlwind he
comes to Morven, to see the children of his pride. The oaks resound on
their mountains, and the rocks fall down before him. Dimly seen as
lightens the night, he strides largely from hill to hill. Bloody was the
hand of my father, when he whirled the gleam of his sword. He remembers
the battles of his youth. The field is wasted in its course!

Ryno went on like a pillar of fire. Dark is the brow of Gaul. Fergus
rushed forward with feet of wind; Fillan like the mist of the hill.
Ossian, like a rock, came down. I exulted in the strength of the king.
Many were the deaths of my arm! dismal the gleam of my sword! My locks
were not then so gray; nor trembled my hands with age. My eyes were not
closed in darkness; my feet failed not in the race!

Who can relate the deaths of the people? who the deeds of mighty heroes?
when Fingal, burning in his

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

wrath, consumed the sons of Lochlin? Groans swelled on groans from hill
to hill, till night had covered all. Pale, staring like a herd of deer,
the sons of Lochlin convene on Lena. We sat and heard the sprightly
harp, at Lubar's gentle stream. Fingal himself was next to the foe. He
listened to the tales of his bards. His godlike race were in the song,
the chiefs of other times. Attentive, leaning on his shield, the king of
Morven sat. The wind whistled through his locks; his thoughts are of the
days of other years. Near him, on his bending spear, my young, my
valiant Oscar stood. He admired the king of Morven: his deeds were
swelling in his soul.

"Son of my son," began the king, "O Oscar, pride of youth: I saw the
shining of the sword. I gloried in my race. Pursue the fame of our
fathers; be thou what they have been, when Trenmor lived, the first of
men, and Trathal, the father of heroes! They fought the battle in their
youth. They are the song of bards. O Oscar! bend the strong in arm; but
spare the feeble hand. Be thou a stream of many tides against the foes
of thy people; but like the gale, that moves the grass. to those who ask
thine aid. So Trenmor lived; such Trathal was; and such has Fingal been.
My arm was the support of the injured; the weak rested behind the
lightning of my steel.

"Oscar! I was young, like thee, when lovely Fainasóllis came: that
sunbeam! that mild light of love! the daughter of Craca's  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) king. I then returned from Cona's heath,
and few were in my train. A white-sailed boat appeared far off; we saw
it like a mist that rode on ocean's wind. It soon approached. We saw the
fair. Her white breast heaved with sighs. The

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

wind was in her loose dark hair; her rosy cheek had tears. 'Daughter of
beauty,' calm I said, 'what sigh is in thy breast? Can I, young as I am,
defend thee, daughter of the sea? My sword is not unmatched in war, but
dauntless is my heart."

"'To thee I fly,' with sighs she said, 'O prince of mighty men! To thee
I fly, chief of the generous shells, supporter of the feeble hand! The
king of Craca's echoing isle owned me the sunbeam of his race. Cromla's
hills have heard the sighs of love for unhappy Fainasóllis! Sora's chief
beheld me fair; he loved the daughter of Craca. His sword is a beam of
light upon the warrior's side. But dark is his brow; and tempests are in
his soul. I shun him on the roaring sea; but Sora's chief pursues.'

"'Rest thou,' I said, 'behind my shield! rest in peace, thou beam of
light! The gloomy chief of Sora will fly, if Fingal's arm is like his
soul. In some lone cave I might conceal thee, daughter of the sea. But
Fingal never flies. Where the danger threatens, I rejoice in the storm
of spears.' I saw the tears upon her cheek. I pitied Craca's fair. Now,
like a dreadful wave afar, appeared the ship of stormy Borbar. His masts
high-bended over the sea behind their sheets of snow. White roll the
waters on either side. The strength of ocean sounds. 'Come thou,' I
said, 'from the roar of ocean, thou rider of the storm. Partake the
feast within my hall. It is the house of strangers.'

"The maid stood trembling by my side. He drew the bow. She fell.
'Unerring is thy hand,' I said, 'but feeble was the foe.' We fought, nor
weak the strife of death. He sunk beneath my sword. We laid them in two
tombs of stone; the hapless lovers of youth! Such have I been, in my
youth, O Oscar! be thou like the age of Fingal. Never search thou for
battle; nor shun it when it comes.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

"Fillan and Oscar of the dark-brown hair! ye that are swift in the race
fly over the heath in my presence. View the sons of Lochlin. Far off I
hear the noise of their feet, like distant sounds in woods. Go: that
they may not fly from my sword, along the waves of the north. For many
chiefs of Erin's race lie here on the dark bed of death. The children of
war are low; the sons of echoing Cromla."

The heroes flew like two dark clouds: two dark clouds that are the
chariots of ghosts; when air's dark children come forth to frighten
hapless men. It was then that Gaul, the son of Morni, stood like a rock
in night. His spear is glittering to the stars; his voice like many
streams.

"Son of battle," cried the chief, "O Fingal, king of shells! let the
bards of many songs soothe Erin's friends to rest. Fingal, sheath thou
thy sword of death; and let thy people fight. We wither away without our
fame; our king is the only breaker of shields! When morning rises on our
hills, behold at a distance our deeds. Let Lochlin feel the sword of
Morni's son; that bards may sing of me. Such was the custom heretofore
of Fingal's noble race. Such was thine own, thou king of swords, in
battles of the spear."

O son of Morni," Fingal replied, "I glory in thy fame. Fight; but my
spear shall be near, to aid thee in the midst of danger. Raise, raise
the voice, ye sons of song, and lull me into rest. Here will Fingal lie,
amidst the wind of night. And if thou, Agandecca, art near, among the
children of thy land; if thou sittest on a blast of wind, among the
high-shrouded masts of Lochlin; come to my dreams, my fair one! Show thy
bright face to my soul ."

Many a voice and many a harp, in tuneful sounds arose. Of Fingal noble
deeds they sung; of Fingal's noble race: and sometimes, on the lovely
sound was

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

heard the name of Ossian. I often fought, and often won in battles of
the spear. But blind, and tearful, and forlorn, I walk with little men!
O Fingal, with thy race of war I now behold thee not. The wild roes feed
on the green tomb of the mighty king of Morven! Blest be thy soul, thou
king of swords, thou most renowned on the hills of Cona!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_79"></span>[318:1](oss26.htm#fr_79.md) The second night, since
the opening of the poem, continues; and Cuthullin, Connal, and Carril,
still sit in the place described in the preceding book.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[319:1](oss26.htm#fr_80.md) This passage most
certainly alludes to the religion of Lochlin, and "the stone of power,"
here mentioned, is the image of one of the deities of Scandinavia.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[320:1](oss26.htm#fr_81.md) All the Northwest coast
of Scotland probably went, of old under the name of Morven, which
signifies a ridge of very high hills.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[326:1](oss26.htm#fr_82.md) What the Craca here
mentioned was, it is not, at this distance of time, easy to determine.
The most probable opinion is, that it was one of the Shetland Isles.
