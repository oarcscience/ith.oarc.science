<I>Ossian</I> purports to be a translation of an epic cycle of Scottish
poems from the early dark ages.
Ossian, a blind bard, sings of the life and battles of Fingal, a
Scotch warrior.
Ossian caused a sensation when it was published on the cusp of
the era of revolutions, and had a massive cultural impact during
the 18th and 19th centuries.
Napolean carried a copy into battle; Goethe translated parts of it;
the city of Selma, Alabama was
named after the home of Fingal, and one of Ingres' most romantic and moody
paintings, the <I>Dream of Ossian</I> (above) was based on it.</P>
<P>
James Macpherson claimed that Ossian was based
on an ancient Gaelic manuscript.
There was just one problem.
The existence of this manuscript was never established.
In fact, unlike Ireland and Wales, there are no
dark-age manuscripts of epic poems, tales, and chronicles and so on
from Scotland.
It isn't that such ancient Scottish poetry and lore didn't exist,
it was just purely oral in nature.
Not much of it was committed to writing until it was on the verge
of extinction.
There are Scottish manuscripts and books in existence today
which date as far back as the 12th century (some with scraps of poetry in them),
but they are principally on subjects such as religion, genealogy,
and land grants.
</P>
<P>
For this and several other reasons which are dealt with in the
<A HREF="oss02.htm">Preliminary Discourse</A> <I>et seq</I>.,
authenticity of the work was widely contested,
particularly by Samuel Johnson.
A huge (and probably excessive) backlash ensued, and conventional
wisdom today brands
<CITE>Ossian</CITE> as one of the great forgeries of history.
</P>
<P>
In fairness, themes, characters and passages of Ossian are based on 
established Celtic and Scottish folklore.
Much of the <A HREF="../celt/pt4/index.htm">fourth volume</A> of
J.F. Campbell's massive
<A HREF="../celt/ptwh.htm">Popular Tales of the West Highlands</A>
is devoted to tracking down Ossianic fragments in circulation prior to
Macpherson,
or elicited from illiterate Highland 
peasants who had never heard of <CITE>Ossian</CITE>.
</P>
<P>
Macpherson is today considered the author
of this work. 
The language of composition was probably English:
As Campbell determined, Macpherson wasn't even particularly
fluent in Gaelic.</P>
<P>
The work has literary merits, and historical importance.
The project resembles other Romantic era attempts at national epic-building
such as the Finnish <A HREF="../kveng/index.htm">Kalevala</A>;
however the Kalevala is acknowledged to
be based on years of ethnographic fieldwork by Elias L&ouml;nnrot.
L&ouml;nnrot is now believed to have composed a few bridge portions of the
Kalevala; but he didn't pull a great deal of the work out of thin air, as did
Macpherson.</P>
