# COLNA-DONA.

### ARGUMENT.

Fingal despatches Ossian and Toscar, the son of Conloch, and father of
Malvina, to raise a stone on the banks of the stream of Crona, to
perpetuate the memory of a victory which he had obtained in that place.
When they were employed in that work, Car-ul, a neighboring chief,
invited them to a feast. They went, and Toscar fell desperately in love
with Colna-dona, the daughter of Car-ul. Colna-dona became no less
enamored of Toscar. An incident at a hunting party brings their loves to
a happy issue.

COL-AMON  <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) of troubled streams, dark
wanderer of distant vales, I behold thy course, between trees near
Car-ul's echoing halls! There dwelt bright Colna-dona, the daughter of
the king. Her eyes were rolling stars; her arms were white as the foam
of streams. Her breast rose slowly to sight, like ocean's heaving wave.
Her soul was a stream of light. Who, among the maids was like the love
of heroes?

Beneath the voice of the king we moved to Crona  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md) of the streams, Toscar of grassy Lutha,
and Ossian young in fields. Three bards attended with songs. Three bossy
shields were borne before us; for we were to rear the stone in memory of
the past. By Crona's mossy course Fingal had scattered his foes; he had
rolled away the strangers like a troubled sea. We came to the place of
renown; from the mountains descended night. I tore an oak from its hill,
and raised a flame on high. I bade my fathers to look down from

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

the clouds of their hall; for, at the fame of their race they brighten
in the wind.

I took a stone from the stream, amidst the song of bards. The blood of
Fingal's foes hung curdled in its ooze. Beneath I placed, at intervals,
three bosses from the shield of foes, as rose or fell the sound of
Ullin's nightly song. Toscar laid a dagger in earth, a mail of sounding
steel. We raised the mould around the stone, and bade it speak to other
years.

Oozy daughter of streams, that now art reared on high, speak to the
feeble, O stone! after Selma's race have failed! Prone from the stormy
night, the traveller shall lay him by thy side: thy whistling moss shall
sound in his dreams; the years that were past shall return. Battles rise
before him, blue-shielded kings descend to war: the darkened moon looks
from heaven on the troubled field. He shall burst with morning from
dreams, and see the tombs of warriors round. He shall ask about the
stone, and the aged shall reply, "This gray stone was raised by Ossian,
a chief of other years!"

From Col-amon came a bard, from Car-ul, the friend of strangers. He bade
us to the feast of kings, to the dwelling of bright Colna-dona. We went
to the hall of harps. There Car-ul brightened between his aged locks,
when he beheld the sons of his friends, like two young branches before
him.

"Sons of the mighty," he said, "ye bring back the days of old, when
first I descended from waves, on Selma's streamy vale! I pursued
Duthmocarglos, dweller of ocean's wind. Our fathers had been foes; we
met by Clutha's winding waters. He fled along the sea, and my sails were
spread behind him. Night deceived me on the deep. I came to the dwelling
of kings, to Selma of high-bosomed maids. Fingal came forth with his
bards, and Conloch, arm of heath. I

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

feasted three days in the hall, and saw the blue eye. Erin, Roscrana,
daughter of heroes, light of Cormac's race. Nor forgot did my steps
depart: the kings gave their shields to Car-ul: they hang on high in
Col-amon, in memory of the past. Sons of the daring kings, ye bring back
the days of old!

Car-ul kindled the oak of feasts, he took two bosses from our shields.
He laid them in earth beneath a stone, to speak to the hero's race.
"When battle," said the king, "shall roar, and our sons are to meet in
wrath, my race shall look perhaps on this stone, when they prepare the
spear. Have not our fathers met in peace? they will say, and lay aside
the shield."

Night came down. In her long locks moved the daughter of Car-ul. Mixed
with the harp arose the voice of white-armed Colna-dona. Toscar darkened
in his place before the love of heroes. She came on his troubled soul,
like a beam to the dark-heaving ocean, when it bursts from a cloud, and
brightens the foamy side of a wave.  <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md)

\* \* \* \* \* \* \*

With morning we awaked the woods and hung forward on the path of the
roes. They fell by their wonted streams. We returned through Crona's
vale. From the wood a youth came forward, with a shield and pointless
spear.--"Whence," said Toscar of Lutha, "is the flying beam? Dwells
there peace at Col-amon, round bright Colna-dona of harps?"

"By Col-amon of streams," said the youth, "bright Colna-dona dwelt. She
dwelt; but her course is now in deserts with the son of the king; he
that seized with love her soul as it wandered through the hall."

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Stranger of tales," said Toscar, "hast thou
marked the warrior's course? He must fall; give thou that bossy shield."
In wrath he took the shield. Fair behind it rose the breasts of a maid,
white as the bosom of a swan, rising graceful on swift-rolling waves, It
was Colna-dona of harps, the daughter of the king! Her blue eyes had
rolled on Toscar, and her love arose!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_51"></span>[239:1](oss15.htm#fr_51.md) Colna-dona signifies
"the love of heroes." Col-amon, "narrow river." Car-ul, "dark-eyed."

<span id="fn_52"></span>[239:2](oss15.htm#fr_52.md) Crona, "murmuring," was
the name of a small stream which discharged itself in the river Carron.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[241:1](oss15.htm#fr_53.md) Here an episode is
entirely lost; or, at least, is handed down so imperfectly, that it does
not deserve a place in the poem.
