### DUAN I.

ARGUMENT OF DUAN I.  <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)

Fingal when very young, making a voyage to the Orkney Islands, was
driven by stress of weather into a bay of Scandinavia, near the
residence of Starno, king of Lochlin. Starno invites Fingal to a feast.
Fingal, doubting the faith of the king, and mindful of a former breach
of hospitality, refuses to go.--Starno gathers together his tribes;
Fingal resolves to defend himself.--Night coming on, Duth-maruno
proposes to Fingal to observe the motions of the enemy.--The king
himself undertakes the watch. Advancing towards the enemy, he
accidentally comes to the cave of Turthor, where Starno had confined
Conban-Cargla, the captive daughter of a neighboring chief.--Her story
is imperfect, a part of the original being lost.--Fingal comes to a
place of worship, where Starno, and his son Swaran, consulted the spirit
of Loda concerning the issue of the war.--The rencounter of Fingal and
Swaran.--Duan first concludes with a description of the airy hall of
Cruth-loda, supposed to be the Odin of Scandinavia.

A TALE of the times of old!

Why, thou wanderer unseen! thou bender of the thistle of Lora; why, thou
breeze of the valley, hast thou left mine ear? I hear no distant roar of
streams! No sound of the harp from the rock! Come, thou huntress of
Lutha, Malvina, call back his soul to the bard. I look forward to
Lochlin of lakes, to the dark billowy bay of U-thorno, where Fingal
descends from ocean, from the roar of winds. Few are the heroes of
Morven in a land unknown!

Starno sent a dweller of Loda to bid Fingal to the feast; but the king
remembered the past, and all his rage arose. "Nor Gormal's mossy towers,
nor Starno, shall Fingal behold. Deaths wander, like shadows, over his
fiery soul! Do I forget that beam of light, the

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

white-handed daughter of kings?  <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) Go,
son of Loda; his words are wind to Fingal: wind, that, to and fro drives
the thistle in autumn's dusky vale. Duth-maruno, arm of death!
Cromma-glas, of Iron shields! Struthmor, dweller of battle's wing!
Cromar, whose ships bound on seas, careless as the course of a meteor,
on dark-rolling clouds! Arise around me, children of heroes, in a land
unknown! Let each look on his shield like Trenmor, the ruler of
wars."--"Come down," thus Trenmor said, "thou dweller between the harps!
Thou shalt roll this stream away, or waste with me in earth."

Around the king they rise in wrath. No words come forth: they seize
their spears. Each soul is rolled into itself. At length the sudden
clang is waked on all their echoing shields. Each takes his hill by
night; at intervals they darkly stand. Unequal bursts the hum of songs,
between the roaring wind!

Broad over them rose the moon!

In his arms came tall Duth-maruno: he, from Croma of rocks, stern hunter
of the boar! In his dark boat he rose on waves, when Crumthormo  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) awaked its woods. In the chase he shone,
among foes: No fear was thine, Duth-maruno!

'O Son of daring Comhal, shall my steps be forward through night? From
this shield shall I view them, over their gleaming tribes? Starno, king
of lakes, is before me, and Swaran, the foe of strangers. Their words
are not in vain, by Loda's stone of power. Should Duth-maruno not
return, his spouse is lonely at home, where meet two roaring streams on
Crathmocraulo's plain. Around are hills, with echoing woods; the ocean
is rolling near. My son looks on

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

screaming sea-fowl, a young wanderer on the field. Give the head of a
boar to Candona, tell him of his father's joy, when the bristly strength
of U-thorno rolled on his lifted spear. Tell him of my deeds in war!
Tell where his father fell!"

"Not forgetful of my fathers," said Fingal, "I have bounded over the
seas. Theirs were the times of danger in the days of old. Nor settles
darkness on me, before foes, though youthful in my locks. Chief of
Crathmocraulo, the field of night is mine."

Fingal rushed, in all his arms, wide bounding over Turthor's stream,
that sent its sullen roar, by night, through Gormal's misty vale. A
moonbeam glittered on a rock; in the midst stood a stately form; a form
with floating locks, like Lochlin's white-bosomed maids. Unequal are her
steps, and short. She throws a broken song on wind. At times she tosses
her white arms: for grief is dwelling in her soul.

"Torcal-torno, of aged locks," she said, "where now are thy steps, by
Lulan? Thou hast failed at thine own dark streams, father of
Conban-cargla! But I behold thee, chief of Lulan, sporting by Loda's
hall, when the dark-skirted night is rolled along the sky. Thou
sometimes hidest the moon with thy shield. I have seen her dim, in
heaven. Thou kindlest thy hair into meteors, and sailest along the
night. Why am I forgot, in my cave, king of shaggy boars? Look from the
hall of Loda, on thy lonely daughter."

"Who art thou," said Fingal, "voice of night?"

She, trembling, turned away.

"Who art thou, in thy darkness?"

She shrunk into the cave.

The king loosed the thong from her hands. He asked about her fathers.

"Torcul-torno," she said, "once dwelt at Lulan's foamy stream: he
dwelt-but now, in Loda's hall, he

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

shakes the sounding shell. He met Starno of Lochlin in war; long fought
the dark-eyed kings. My father fell, in his blood, blue-shielded
Torcul-torno! By a rock, at Lulan's stream, I had pierced the bounding
roe. My white hand gathered my hair from off the rushing winds. I heard
a noise. Mine eyes were up. My soft breast rose on high. My step was
forward, at Lulan, to meet thee, Torcul-torno. It was Starno, dreadful
king! His red eves rolled on me in love. Dark waved his shaggy brow,
above his gathered smile. Where is my father, I said, he that was mighty
in war! Thou art left alone among foes, O daughter of Torcul-torno! He
took my hand. He raised the sail. In this cave he placed me dark. At
times he comes a gathered mist. He lifts before me my father's shield.
But often passes a beam of youth far distant from my cave. The son of
Starno moves in my sight. He dwells lonely in my soul."

"Maid of Lulan," said Fingal, "white-handed daughter of grief! a cloud,
marked with streaks of fire, is rolled along my soul. Look not to that
dark-robed moon; look not to those meteors of heaven. My gleaming steel
is around thee, the terror of my foes! It is not the steel of the
feeble, nor of the dark in soul! The maids are not shut in our caves of
streams! They toss not their white arms alone. They bend fair within
their locks, above the harps of Selma. Their voice is not in the desert
wild. We melt along the pleasing sound!"

\* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Fingal again advanced his steps, wide through the bosom of night, to
where the trees of Loda shook amid squally winds. Three stones, with
heads of moss, are there; a stream with foaming course: and dreadful,
rolled around them, is the dark red cloud of Loda. High from its top
looked forward a ghost, half formed

<span id="img_19200"></span> ![](img/19200.jpg)  
By a rock at Lulan's stream I had pierced the bounding roe.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

of the shadowy stroke. He poured his voice, at times, amidst the roaring
stream. Near, bending beneath a blasted tree, two heroes received his
words: Swaran of lakes, and Starno, foe of strangers. On their dun
shields they darkly leaned: their spears are forward through night.
Shrill sounds the blast of darkness in Starno's floating beard.

They heard the tread of Fingal. The warriors rose in arms. "Swaran, lay
that wanderer low," said Starno, in his pride. "Take the shield of thy
father. It is a rock in war." Swaran threw his gleaming spear. It stood
fixed in Loda's tree. Then came the foes forward with swords. They mixed
their rattling steel. Through the thongs of Swaran's shield rushed the
blade  <span id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42.md) of Luno. The shield fell
rolling on earth. Cleft, the helmet fell down. Fingal stopt the lifted
steel. Wrathful stood Swaran, unarmed. He rolled his silent eyes; he
threw his sword on earth. Then, slowly stalking over the stream, he
whistled as he went.

Nor unseen of his father is Swaran. Starno turns away in wrath. His
shaggy brows were dark above his gathered rage. He strikes Loda's tree
with his spear. He raises the hum of songs. They come to the host of
Lochlin, each in his own dark path; like two foam-covered streams from
two rainy vales! To Turthor's plain Fingal returned. Fair rose the beam
of the east. It shone on the spoils of Lochlin in the hand of the king.
From her cave came forth, in her beauty, the daughter of Torcul-torno.
She gathered her hair from wind. She wildly raised her song. The song of
Lulan of shells, where once her father dwelt. She saw Starno's bloody
shield. Gladness

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

rose, a light, on her face. She saw the cleft helmet of Swaran She
shrunk, darkened, from Fingal. "Art thou fallen by thy hundred streams,
O love of the mournful maid?"

U-thorno that risest in waters! on whose side are the meteors of night?
I behold the dark moon descending behind thy resounding woods. On thy
top dwells the misty Loda: the house of the spirits of men! In the end
of his cloudy hall bends forward Cruth-loda of swords. His form is dimly
seen amid his wavy mist. His right hand is on his shield. In his left is
the half viewless shell. The roof of his dreadful hall is marked with
nightly fires!

The race of Cruth-loda advance, a ridge of formless shades. He reaches
the sounding shell to those who shone in war. But between him and the
feeble, his shield rises a darkened orb. He is a setting meteor to the
weak in arms. Bright as a rainbow on streams, came Lulan's white-bosomed
maid.
