THE French origin of the *cantares de gesta* has already been alluded
to. Their very name, indeed, bespeaks a Gallic source. But in justice to
the national genius of Spain we trust that it has been made abundantly
clear that the *cantares* speedily cast off the northern mode and robed
themselves in Castilian garb. Some lands possess an individuality so
powerful, a capacity of absorption and transmutation so exceptional,
that all things, both physical and spiritual, which invade their borders
become transfigured and speedily metamorphosed to suit their new
environment. Of this magic of transformations Spain, with Egypt and
America, seems to hold the especial secret. But transfigure the
*chansons* of France as she might, the mould whence they came is
apparent to those who are cognisant of their type and machinery. Nor
could the character of their composers and professors be substantially
altered, so that we must not be surprised to find that in Spain the
*trouvères* and *jongleurs* of France *trovadores* and *juglares*. The
*trovador* was the poet, the author, the *juglar* merely the singer or
declaimer, although no very hard-and-fast line was drawn betwixt them.
Some *juglares* of more than ordinary distinction were also the authors
of the *cantares* they sang, while an unsuccessful

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

trovador might be forced to chant the verses of others. Instrumentalists
or accompanists were known as *juglares de peñola* in contradistinction
to the reciters or singers, *juglares de boca* .

 

The Singers of Old Spain

With the *juglar*, indeed, was left the final form of the *cantar* , for
he would shape it and shear it, add to or suppress, as his instinct told
him the taste of his audience demanded. Not infrequently he would try to
pour the wine of a *cantar* into the bottle of a popular air, and if it
overflowed and was spilt, so much the worse for the *cantar*. Frequently
he was accompanied not only by an instrumentalist, but by a
*remendador*, or mimic, who illustrated his tale in dumb show. These
sons of the gay science were notoriously careless of their means of
livelihood, and lived a hand-to-mouth existence. A crust of bread and a
cup of wine sufficed them when silver was scarce. Unsullied by the lust
of hire, they journeyed from hall to hall, from castle to castle,
unmindful of all but their mission—to suit the asperities of a barbarous
age.

But this simple state did not last. As the taste for the *cantares*
grew, the *trovadores* and their satellites, after the manner of
mankind, became clamorous for the desirable things of life, making the
age-long plea of the artist that the outward insignia of beauty are his
very birthright, and forgetting how fatal it is to

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

These "spirits beyond the moon" did not, alas! "refuse the boon." Kings,
infants and peers indulged the *trovador* out of full purses, flattered
him by imitating his art and life, and even enrolled themselves in his
brotherhood. Few men of genius are so constituted as to be able to
control altogether a natural hauteur and superiority. In these early
days poetical arrogance seems to have been as unchecked as military
boastfulness, and the *trovadores*, pampered and fêted by prince and
noble, at length grew insufferable in their intolerance and rapacity.
The land swarmed with singers, real and pretended, the manner of whose
lives became a scandal, even in a day when scandal was cheap. The public
grew weary of the repetition of the *cantares* and the harping on a
single string. It became fashionable to read romances instead of
listening to them, and eventually, we see the *juglares* footing it on
the highways of Spain, and declaiming at street-corners in a state of
mendicancy more pitiable by far than their old indigent yet dignified
conditions.

Few of the ancient *cantares* of Spain have survived, in
contradistinction to the hundreds or more *chansons* that France can
show. But what remains of them suffices to distinguish their type with
sufficient clearness. As has been indicated, we owe our knowledge of
more than one of them to the circumstance that they became embedded in
the ancient chronicles of Spain. An excellent illustration of this
process of literary embalming is provided by the manner in which the
*cantar* of Bernaldo de Carpio has become encrusted in the rather dreary
mass of the *General Chronicle of Spain* which was compiled by King
Alfonso the Wise (c.1260), in which it will be found in the seventh and
twelfth

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

chapters of the third part. The poet king states that he has founded his
history of Bernaldo upon "old lays," and in the spirit as well as the
form of his account of the legendary champion we can trace the influence
of the *cantar*.

 

The Story of Bernaldo de Carpio

Young Bernaldo de Carpio, when he arrived at manhood, was, like many
another hero of romance, unaware of his illustrious parentage, for his
mother was a sister of Don Alfonso of Castile, and had wed in secret the
brave and noble Count de Sandias de Saldaña. King Alfonso, bitterly
offended that his sister should mate with one who was her inferior in
rank, cast the Count into prison, where he caused him to be deprived of
sight, and immured the princess in a cloister. Their son Bernaldo,
however, he reared with care. While still a youth, Bernaldo rendered his
uncle important services, but when he learned that his father languished
in prison a great melancholy settled upon him, and he cared no more for
the things that had once delighted him. Instead of mingling in the
tourney or the dance, he put on deep mourning, and at last presented
himself before King Alfonso and beseeched him to set his father at
liberty.

Now Alfonso was greatly troubled when he knew that Bernaldo was aware of
his lineage and of his father’s imprisonment, but his hatred for the man
who had won his sister was greater than his love for his nephew. At
first he made no reply, but sat plucking at his beard, so taken aback
was he. But kings are not often at a loss, and Alfonso, thinking to
brush matters aside by brusque words, frowned, and said sternly:
"Bernaldo, as you

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

love me, speak no more of this matter. I swear to you that never in all
the days of my life shall your father leave his prison."

"Sir," replied Bernaldo, "you are my king and may do whatsoever you
shall hold for good, but I pray God that He will change your mind on
this matter."

King Alfonso had no son of his own, and in an ill moment had proposed
that Charlemagne, the mighty Emperor of the Franks, should be regarded
as his successor. But his nobles remonstrated against his choice, and
refused to receive a Frank as heir to the throne of Christian Spain.
Charlemagne, learning of Alfonso’s proposal, prepared to invade Spain on
the pretext of expelling the Moors, but Alfonso, repenting of his
intention to leave his crown to a foreigner, called his forces around
him and allied himself with the Saracens. A battle, fierce and
sustained, took place in the Pass of Roncesvalles, in which the Franks
were signally defeated, chiefly by the address of Bernaldo, who slew the
famous champion Roland with his own hand.

These and the other services of Bernaldo King Alfonso endeavored to
reward. But neither gift nor guerdon would young Bernaldo receive at his
hands, save only the freedom of his father. Again and again did the King
promise to fulfil his request, but as often found an excuse for breaking
his word, until at last Bernaldo, in bitter disappointment, renounced
his allegiance and declared war against his treacherous uncle. The King,
in dread of his nephew’s popularity and war-like ability, at last had
recourse to a stratagem of the most dastardly kind. He assured Bernaldo
of his father’s release if he would agree to the surrender of the great

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

castle of Carplo. The young champion immediately gave up its keys in
person, and eagerly requested that his father might at once be restored
to him. The treacherous Alfonso in answer pointed to a group of horsemen
who approached at a gallop.

"Yonder, Bernaldo, is thy father," he said mockingly. "Go and embrace
him."

"Bernaldo," says the chronicle, "went toward him and kissed his hand.
But when he found it cold and saw that all his colour was black, he knew
that he was dead; and with the grief he had from it he began to cry
aloud and to make great moan, saying: 'Alas! Count Sandias, in an evil
hour was I born, for never was man so lost as I am now for you; for
since you are dead and my castle is gone, I know no counsel by which I
may do aught.'" Some say in their *cantares de gesta* that the King then
said: "Bernaldo, now is not the time for much talking, and therefore I
bid you go straightway forth from my land."

Broken-hearted and utterly crushed by this final blow to his hopes,
Bernaldo turned his horse's head and rode slowly away. And from that day
his banner was not seen in Christian Spain, nor the echoes of his horn
heard among her hills. Hopeless and desperate, he took service with the
Moors. But his name lives in the romances and ballads of his native
country as that of a great champion foully wronged by the treachery of
an unjust and revengeful King.

Although the *cantares* of Fernan Gonzalez and the Children of Lara also
lie embedded in the chronicles, I have preferred to deal with them in
the chapter on the ballads, the form in which they are undoubtedly best
known.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

The "Poema del Cid"

But by far the most complete and characteristic of the *cantares de
gesta* is the celebrated *Poema del Cid*, the title which has become
attached to it in default of al knowledge of its original designation.
That it is a *cantar* must be plain to all who possess even a slight
familiarity with the *chansons de gestes* of France. Like many of the
*chansons* heroes, the Cid experiences royal ingratitude, and is later
taken back into favour. The stock phrases of the *chansons*, too, are
constantly to be met with in the poem, and the atmosphere of boastful
herohood arising from its pages strengthens the resemblance. There is
also pretty clear proof that the author of the *Poema* had read or heard
the *Chanson de Roland*. This is not to say that he practised the vile
art of adaptation or the viler art of paraphrase, or in any way filched
from the mighty epic of Roncesvalles. But superficial borrowings of
incident appear, which are, however, amply redeemed by originality of
treatment arid inspiration. The thought and expression are profoundly
national nor does the language exhibit French influence, save, as has
been said, in the matter of well-worn expressions, the *clichés* of
medieval epic.

 

Its Only Manuscript

But one manuscript of the *Poema del Cid* is known, the handiwork of a
certain Per or Pedro the Abbot. About the third quarter of the
eighteenth century, Sanchez, the royal librarian, was led to suspect
through certain bibliographical references that such a manuscript might
exist in the neighbourhood of Bivar, the birthplace of the hero of the
poem, and he succeeded in unearthing it in that village. The date at the
end is given as\[paragraph continues\]

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

Mille CCXLV, and authorities are not agreed as to its significance, some
holding that a vacant space showing an erasure after the second C is
intentional, and that it should read 1245 (1207 new style). Others
believe that I307 is the true date of the MS. However that may be, the
poem itself is referred to a period not earlier than the middle of the
twelfth nor later than the middle of the thirteenth century. As we
possess it, the manuscript is in a rather mutilated and damaged
condition. The commencement and title are lost, a page in the middle is
missing, and the end has been sadly patched by an unskilful hand.
Sanchez states, in his *Poesías Castellanas anteriores al Siglo XV*
(1779 – 90) that he had seen a copy made in 1596 which showed that the
MS. had the same deficiencies then as now.

 

Its Authorship Unknown

The personality of the author of the *Poema del Cid* will probably for
ever remain unknown. He may have been a churchman, as Ormsby suggests,
but I am inclined to the opinion that he was a professional *trovador* .
The *trouvères*, rather than ecclesiastics, were responsible for such
works in France, and why not the *trovadores* in Spain?  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) That the writer lived near the time of the

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

events he celebrated is plain, probably about half a century after the
Cid sheathed his famous sword Colada for the last time. On the ground of
various local allusions in the poem he has been claimed as a native of
the Valle de Arbujuelo and as a monk of the monastery of Cardena, near
Burgos. But these surmises have nothing but textual references to
recommend them, and are only a little more probable than that which
would make him an Asturian because he does not employ the diphthong
*ue*. We have good grounds, however, for the assumption that he was at
least a Castilian, and these are to be found in his fierce political
animus against the kingdom of Leon and all that pertained to it. That
Pedro the Abbot was merely a copyist is clear from his mishandling of
the manuscript; for though we have to thank him for the preservation of
the Poema, our gratitude is dashed with irritation at the manner in
which he has passed it on to us, for his copy is replete with vain
repetitions, he frequently runs two lines into one, and occasionally
even transfers the matter of one line to another in his haste to be free
of his task.

 

Other Cantares of the Cid

That other *cantares* relating to the Cid existed is positively known
through the researches of Senor Don Ramón Menéndez Pidal, who has
demonstrated that one of them was used in the most ancient version of
the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

Crónica General, of which three recensions evidently existed at
different periods, and it is now clear that the passage in question does
not come from the *Poema* as we have it, as was formerly believed. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) The passages on the Cid in the second
version of the *Crónica* are also derived from still another *cantar* on
the popular hero, known as the Crónica Rimada,  <span
id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md) or *Cantar de Rodrigo*, evidently the work
of a *juglar* of Palencia, and which seems to be a *mélange* of several
lost *cantares* relating to the Cid, as well as to other Spanish
traditions. This version, however, is much later than the Poema, and is
chiefly interesting as enshrining many traditions relative to the Cid as
well as to the ancient folk-tales of Spain.

 

Metre of the "Poema del Cid"

It would certainly seem as if, like all *cantares*, the poem had been
especially written for public recitation. The expression *"0 senores,"*
encountered in places, may be taken as the equivalent of the English "
Listen, lordings," of such frequent occurrence in our own lays and
romances, which was intended to appeal to the attention or spur the
flagging interest of a medieval audience. The metre in which the poem is
written is almost as unequal as its poetic quality. The prevailing line
is the Alexandrine or fourteen-syllabled verse, but some lines run far
over this average, while others are truncated in barbarous fashion,
probably through the inattention or haste of the copyist. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[4](#fn_28.md) It seems to me

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

that the *Poema,* although of the highest merit in many of its finest
passages, has received the most extravagant eulogy, and I suspect that
many of the English critics who descant so glibly upon its excellences
have never perused it in its entirety. Considerable tracts of it are of
the most pedestrian description, and in places it descends to a doggerel
which recalls these metrical barbarities of the pantomime. Hut when the
war-trump gives him the key it arouses the singer as it arouses Scott –
the parallel is an apt and almost exact one – and it is a mighty
orchestra indeed which breaks upon our ears. The lines surge and swell
in true Homeric tempest-sound, and as we listen to the crash of
Castilian spears upon the Moorish ranks we are reminded of those
sounding lines in Swinburne’s *Erechtheus* beginning:

But the music of the singer of the *Poema* does not depend upon
reverberative effect alone. His is the true music of battle, burning the
blood with keenest fire, and he has no need to rely solely upon the
gallop of his

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

metrical war-horse to excite our admiration, as does the English poet.

 

The Poem Opens

The opening of the *Poema del Cid,* as we possess it, is indeed
sufficiently striking and dramatic to console us for the loss of the
original commencement. The great commander , banished (*c.* 1088) by
royal order from the house of his father through the treachery of the
Leonese party at the Court or King Alfonso, rides away disconsolately
from the broken gates of his castle. A fairly accurate translation of
this fine passage might read as follows:

He turns to see the ruined hold, the tears rail thick and fast,  
The empty chests, the broken gates, all open to the blast.  
Sans raiment am the wardrobes, reft of mantle and of vair,  
The empty hollow of the hall of tapestry is hare.  
No feather in the falconry, no hawk to come to hand,  
A noble beggar must the Cid renounce his father’s land.  
He sighed, but as a warrior sighs. "Now I shall not repine  
All praise to Thee, our Father; for Thy grace to me and mine.  
The slanderous tongue, the lying tale have wrought nay wreck to-day,  
But 'Thou in Thy good due, O Lord, the debt wilt sure repay. "  
As they rode out of Bivar flew a raven to the right,  
By Burgos as they bridled the bird was still in sight  
The Cid he shrugged his shoulders as the omen he espied;  
"Greeting, Cousin Alvar Fañez; we am exiles now," he cried.  
The sixty lances of the Cid rode clattering through the town;  
From casement and from turret-top the burgherfolk looked down.  
Sore were their hearts, and salt their eyen as Roderick rode by;  
"There goes a worthy vassal who has known bad mastery."  
And many a roof that night had sheltered Roderick and his band  
But for the dead in Burgos of Alfonso's heavy hand.  
The missive broad with kingly seals had run throughout the town:  
"Who aids the Cid in banishment, his house shall be cast down."  
So as the train rode through the streets each eye was turned aside,  
All silent was the town-house where the Cid was wont to bide;

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

Both lock and bar were on the gates, he might not enter there.  
Then from a casement spoke a maid who had the house in care:  
"My lord Don Roderick, who took the sword in happy hour,  
The King hath sent a letter broad to ban from hall and bower  
Both thee and all thy company, 'tis doom to shelter one;  
Never again who aids thee shall his eyes look on the sun.  
Now go, and Goddés help with thee, thy pity we implore;  
In all broad Spain thou canst not lack, O Cid Campeador."

Finding no place to lay their heads within the town, the Cid with his
men rode disconsolately to the plain of Glera, to the east of Burgos,
where he pitched his tents on the banks of the river Arlanzon. To him
came Martin Antolinez, one of his former vassals, who brought food and
wine for all his train and strove to comfort him. Not a *maravedi* had
the Cid, and how to furnish his men with arms and food he knew not. But
he and Antolinez took counsel together, and hit upon a plan by which
they hoped to procure the necessary sinews of war. Taking two large
chests, they covered them with red leather and studded them with gilt
nails, so that they made a brave outward show. Then they filled the
chests with sand from the river-banks and locked them securely.

 

Money-lending in the Eleventh Century

"Martin Antolinez," said the Cid, "thou art a true man and a good
vassal. Go thou to the Jews Raquel and Vidas, and tell them I have much
treasure which I desire to leave with them since it is too weighty to
carry along with me. Pledge thou these chests with them for what may
seem reasonable. I call God and all His saints to witness that I do this
thing because I am driven to extremity and for the sake of those who
depend upon me." Antolinez, rather fearful of his mission, sought out
the Jews Raquel and Vidas where they counted out their

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

wealth and their profits. He told them that the Cid had levied much
tribute which he found it impossible to carry him, and that he would
pledge this with them if would lend him a reasonable sum upon it. But he
stipulated that they must solemnly bind themselves not open the chests
for a year to come. The Jews took counsel together, and consented to
hide the chests and not to look upon their contents for a year at least.

"But tell us," they said, " what sum will content the Cid, and what
interest will he give us for the year?"

"Needy men gather to my lord the Cid from all sides," said Antolinez.
"He will require at least six hundred marks."

"We will willingly give that sum," said Raquel and "for the treasure of
such a great lord as the Cid must indeed be immense."

"Hasten then," said Antolinez, "for night approaches, and my lord the
Cid is under decree of banishment to quit Castile at once."

"Nay," said the Jews, after the manner of their kind. "Business is not
done thus, but by first taking and then giving." They then requested to
be taken to where the Cid lay, and having greeted him, paid over the sum
agreed upon. They were surprised and delighted at the sight of the
chests, and departed well satisfied, giving Antolinez a present or
commission of thirty golden for the share he had taken in the business.

Donna Ximena  <span id="fr_29"></span>[\*](#fn_29.md)

When they had gone the Cid struck his camp and galloped through the
night to the monastery of San Pedro de Cardena, where his lady, Donna
Ximena, and his two young daughters lay. He found them

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

deeply engaged in prayer for his welfare, and received him with
heartfelt expressions of joy. Taking the Abbot aside, the Cid explained
to him that he about to fare forth on adventure in the country of the
Moors, and tendered him such a sum as would provide for the maintenance
of Donna Ximena and her daughters until his return, as well as a goodly
bounty for convent's sake.

By this time tidings of the Cid's banishment had gone throughout the
land broadcast, and so great was the fame of his prowess that cavaliers
from near and far flocked to his banner. When he put foot in stirrup at
bridge of Arlanza a hundred and fifty gentlemen had assembled to follow
his fortunes. The parting with his wife and daughters presents a
poignant picture of leave-taking:

Sharp as the pain when finger-nails are wrenched from off the hand  
So felt the Cid this agony, but turned him to his hand,  
And vaulted in the saddle, and forth led his menie,  
But ever and anon he turned his streaming eyes to see  
Their faces he might see no more, till blunt Minaya, irked  
To see the yearning and regret that on his heartstrings worked  
Cried out, "O born in a happy hour,"  <span
id="fr_30"></span>[5](#fn_30.md) let not thy soul be sad.  
The heart of knight on venture hound should never but be glad  
The heavy sorrow of to-day will prove to-morrow's joy.  
What grief can bide the trumpets' sound, what woe the hat ploy?"

Giving rein to their steeds, they galloped forth of the bounds of
Christian Spain and, crossing the river Duero on rafts, stood upon
Moorish soil. Far to the west they could see the slender minarets of the
Saracen city of Ahilon glittering in the high sun of noon, emblematic

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

of the rich treasure they had come to win in the land of the paynim. At
Higeruela still more good lances rallied to the Cid's banners, border
men to whom the foray was a holiday and the breaking of spears the
sweetest music. As he slept that night the Cid dreamed that the
Archangel Gabriel appeared to him and said "Mount, O Cid Campeador,
mount and ride. Thy cause is just. Whilst thou livest thou shalt
prosper!"

With three hundred lances behind him, the Cid rode into the land of the
Moors. He lay in ambush while Alvar Fañez and other knights made a foray
toward Alcala. In their absence the Cid observed that the men of
Castijon, a Moorish town hard by, came out of the place to work in the
fields, leaving the gates open. He and his men made a dash at the gates,
slew the handful of heathens who guarded them, and took the town without
striking a score of blows. The men were well content at the treasure of
gold and silver they found in the quaint Moorish houses. But they were
merciful to the inhabitants, of whom they made servitors rather than
slaves.

 

The Taking of Alcocer

After they had rested at Castijon, the Cid and his array rode down the
valley of the Henares, passing by way of Alhamia to Bubierca and Ateca,
and as he was in unknown country, and environed round by hosts of
enemies, he took up a position upon a "round hill" near the strong
Saracen city of Alcocer, to which he set siege. But the place was well
guarded, and he saw that if he were to penetrate its defences it must be
by stratagem and not by fighting alone. So one morning, after he had
beleaguered Alcocer for full fifteen weeks, he withdrew

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

his men as if retreating in disgust, leaving but one pavilion behind
him. When the Moors beheld his withdrawal they exalted, and in their
eagerness to see what spoil the solitary tent might contain they rushed
out of the town, leaving the gates open and unguarded.

Now when the Cid saw that there was a wide space between the Moors and
the gate of Alcocer, he ordered his men to turn and fall upon the
excited rabble of Saracens. Small need had he to ask them to smite the
paynim. Dashing among the dense crowd with levelled lances, the
cavaliers of Castile did fearful execution. The wretched Moors, taken
completely by surprise, fled wildly in all directions, and soon the
plain was littered with white-robed corpses. Meanwhile the Cid himself,
with a few trusted followers, galloped to the gates and secured them, so
that with much triumph the Spaniards entered Alcocer. As before, the
Campeador was merciful to such of the Moors as made full surrender,
saying, "We cannot sell them, and we shall gain nothing by cutting off
their heads. Let us make them rather serve us."

The Saracens in the neighbouring towns of Ateca and Zerrel were aghast
at the manner in which Alcocer had been taken, and sent word to the
Moorish King of Valencia how one called Roderigo Diaz of Bivar, a
Castilian outlaw, had come into their land to spoil it, and had already
taken the strong city of Alcocer. When King Tamin of Valencia heard
these tidings he was greatly wroth, and sent an army of three thousand
well-appointed men against the Campeador. In his anger he charged his
captains that they should take the Spanish renegade alive, and bring him
where justice might be done to him.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

The Cid knew nothing of the coming of this host, and one morning his
sentinels, pacing the walls of Alcocer, were surprised to see the
surrounding country alive with Moorish scouts, flitting from point to
point upon their active jennets, and shaking their scimetars in menace.
His own outposts soon brought in word that he was surrounded, and his
knights and men-at-arms clamoured to be led forth to do battle with the
infidels. But the Cid was old in Moorish warfare, and denied them for
the moment. For days the enemy paraded around the walls of Alcocer. But
the Cid, with three hundred men, knew well the folly of attacking three
thousand, and bided his time.

 

The Combat With the Moorish King

At last the Moors succeeded in cutting off the water-supply of Alcocer.
Provisions, too, were running low, and the Cid saw clearly that such a
desperate situation demanded a desperate remedy. Alvar Fañez, ever
panting for the fight like a war-horse that hears the trumpet, urged an
immediate sally in force, and the Cid, knowing the high spirit of his
men, consented. First he sent all the Moors out of the city and looked
to its defences. Then, leaving but two men to guard the gate, he
marshalled his array and issued forth from Alcocer with dressed ranks
and in strict order of battle. And here prose must once more give place
to verse. <span id="fr_31"></span>[6](#fn_31.md)

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

Huzza! Huzza! The Moorman mounts and waves his crescent blade  
Hark to the thunder of the drums, the trump’s fanfaronade!  
Around two glittering gonfanons the paynim take their stand,  
Beneath each waving banner’s folds is massed a swarthy band.  
The turbaned sons of Termagaunt sweep onward like the sea;  
So trust they to engulf and drown the Christian chivalry.  
"Now gentles, keep ye fast your seats," cries the Campeador,  
"And hold your ranks, for such a charge saw never a knight before."  
But the fierce heart of Bermuez that echoed to the drum  
Cried, "Santiago, shall I stay the while these heathen come?  
With this bold banner shall I pierce yon pride of paynimrie.  
So follow, follow cavaliers, for Spain and Christendie!"  
"Nay, comrade, stay!" implored the Cid, "but Pero shook his head.  
His hand was loose upon the rein. "It may not be," he said;  
Then in his destrier’s flank he drove the bright speed-making spur:  
Like a spray-scattering ship he clove the sands of Alcocer.  
Lost in a sea of Saracens, whose turbans surge as foam,  
He stands unshaken as a cliff when on its bosom come  
Madness of ocean and the wrath of seas that overwhelm.  
So rain the hounds of Máhomet fierce blows on shield and helm.  
"A rescue, rescue," cries the Cid, "and strike for Holy Land!  
Up, gentlemen of Old Castile, and charge the heathen brood!"  
As forth the hound when from the leash the hunter’s hand is ta’en,  
As the unhooded falcon bounds, her jesses cast amain,  
But fiercer far than falcon or the hound’s unleashed zeal  
Comes crashing down upon the foe the fury of Castile.  
Now rally, rally, to the flash of Roderigo’s blade,  
The champion of Bivar is here who never was gainsaid.  

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

Three hundred levelled lances strike as one upon the foe.  
Down, down in death upon the sand three hundred heathen go.  
The lances rise, the lances fall, how fast the deadly play!  
Ah, God! the sundered shields that lie in dreadful disarray.  
The snow-white bannerets are dyed with blood of Moorish slain,  
And charged rush all masterless across the littered plain.  
As lightning circles Roderick's sword above the huddled foe,  
With Alvar Fañez, Gustioz, and half a hundred moe  
He reaps right bloodily. But stay, the Saracens have slain  
Bold Alvar Fañez' destrier; to aid him comes amain  
The Cid Campeador, for sore the brave Minaya's need.  
His way is barred, his stride is marred by a tall emir's steed.  
His falchion swoops, his falchion stoops, down sinks the turbaned
lord.  
"Mount in his place, Minaya, mount ! I need thy trenchant sword.  
The phalanx of the foe is firm, unbroken still they stand."  
The stout Minaya leaps in selle, and falchion in hand  
Strews death to left and right, his trust to rout the Moor right soon.  
But see, the Cid hath fiercely rid with blood-embroidered shoon  
Upon the Moorish capitan, he cleaves his shining shield  
The haughty Moslem turns to fly\~that blow hath won the field.  
Bold Martin Antolinez aims a stroke at Calve's head  
The jewelled casque it cracks in twain, the infidel hath fled  
Rather than bide its fellow; he and Fariz make retreat  
They caracoled to victory, they gallop from defeat.  
Ne’er was a field so worthy sung since first men sang of war.  
Its laurels unto thee belong, O Cid Campeador!

Fierce and sanguinary was the pursuit. The Moorish rout was complete,
and the little Castilian hand had lost it fifteen men. Five hundred Arab
horses, heavily caparisoned, each with a splendid sword at the
saddle-bow, fell into the hands of the Cid, who kept a fifth share for
himself, as was the way with the commanders of such free companies as he
led. But greatly desiring to make his peace with King Alfonso of
Castile, he  
  
<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

sent the trusty Alvar Fañez to Court with thirty steeds saddled and
bridled in the Moorish fashion.

But the Moors, even with the dust of defeat in their mouths, were not
minded to leave the Cid the freedom of their borders, and seeing that he
would not be able to hold Alcocer for long against their numbers, he
bargained with the Saracens of the neighbouring cities for the ransom of
Alcocer. This they gladly agreed to for three thousand marks of gold and
silver, so, quitting the place, the Campeador pushed southward, and took
up a position on a hill above the district of Mont'real. He laid all the
Moorish towns in the neighbourhood under tribute, remaining in his new
encampment full fifteen weeks.

Meanwhile Alvar Fañez had journeyed to the Court and had presented the
King with the thirty good steeds taken in battle. "It is yet too soon to
take the Cid back into favour," said Alfonso, "but since these horses
come from the infidel, I scruple not to receive them. I pardon thee,
Alvar Fañez, and withdraw my banishment from thee. But as to the Cid, I
say no more than that any good lance who cares to join him may do so
without hindrance from me."

 

The War with Raymond Berenger

Now the Count of Barcelona, Raymond Berenger, haughty and arrogant lord,
conceived the presence of the Cid in a territory so near his own
dominions to be an insult to himself, and in a high passion he mustered
all his forces, Moorish as well as Christian, so that he might drive the
Cid from the lands he held in tribute.

The Campeador, hearing of the advance of this host, sent a courteous
message to Count Raymond, assuring

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

him of pacific intentions toward himself. But the Count felt that his
personal dignity had been offended, and refused to receive the
messenger.

When the Cid beheld the army of Raymond marching against his position on
the heights of Mont'real, he knew that his overtures for peace had been
in vain, and, dressing his ranks for the fierce combat that he knew must
follow, took up a position upon the plain suitable for cavalry. The
lightly armed Moorish horsemen of Berenger's host rushed precipitately
to the attack, but were easily routed by the Castilian cavaliers. The
Count's Frankish menat-arms1 a band of skilful and warlike mercenaries,
then thundered down-hill upon the lances of the Cid. The shock was
terrific, but brief was the combat, for the knights of Castile, hardened
by constant warfare, speedily overthrew the Frankish horsemen. The Cid
himself attacked Count Berenger, took him prisoner, and forced him to
deliver up his famous sword Colada, which figures so prominently in the
mighty deeds which follow. A falchion which tradition states is none
other than this celebrated blade, the Spanish Excalibur, is still shown
at the Armeria at Madrid, and all pious lovers of chivalry will gladly
believe that it is the sword taken by the Campeador from the haughty
Berenger, even though the profane point out that its hilt is obviously
of the fifteenth century

Greatly content were they of the Cid's company with the victory no less
than with the spoil, and a feast worthy of princes was prepared to
celebrate the occasion.

In courtesy the Cid invited the defeated Count Raymond to feast with
him, but he refused the invitation with hauteur, saying that his capture
by outlaws had taken I away his appetite. Nettled at this display of
rudeness,

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

the Cid told him that he would not see his realms again until he broke
bread and drank wine with him. Three whole days did the Count refuse to
touch all provender, and on the third day, the Cid promised him
immediate freedom if he would break his fast. This was too much for the
haughty Berenger, whose hunger now outmatched his scruples. "Powers
above " exclaims the poet, "with what gust did he eat. His hands plied
so quickly that my Cid  <span id="fr_32"></span>[7](#fn_32.md) might not
see their play." The Cid then gave him his liberty, and they parted on
good terms.

"Ride on, ride on, my noble Count, a free Frank as thou art;  
For all the spoil thou leavest me I thank thee from my heart.  
And if to turn the chance of fate against me thou shalt come,  
Right gladly shall I listen for the echoes of thy drum."  
"Nay, Roderick, I leave in peace and peace I shall maintain;  
For me thou sure hast spoil enow to count a twelvemonth’s gain."  
He drove the spur, but backward glanced, he feared for treachery;  
So black a thought the Cid had harboured not for Christendie.  
No, not for all the wealthy world, who kept his soul in light.  
Whose heart as his so free from guile, the very perfect knight?

 

The Cid Makes War Seaward

Turning from Huesca and Montalvan, the Cid began to make war towards the
salt sea. His eastward march struck terror in the hearts of the Moors of
Valencia. They took counsel together, and resolved to send such a host
against him as they thought he might not withstand. But he routed them
with such a slaughter that they dared face him no more. Three years did
the Cid

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

war in that country, and his many conquests there were long to tell. He
and his men sat themselves down in the land as kings, reaped its corn,
and ate its bread. And a great famine came upon the Moor, so that
thousands perished.

Now the Cid sent messengers to Castile and Aragon, who made it known
that all Christians who came to dwell beneath his rule should fare well.
Hearing this, thousands flocked to his banner, and so greatly was he
reinforced that in time he was able to march against Valencia itself,
the capital of the Moors of that country.

With all his host he sat down before that city and beleaguered it. Nine
months he environed it, and in the tenth month the men of Valencia
opened the gates and surrendered the place. Great was the booty of gold
and silver and precious stuffs, so that there fell to his share alone
treasure to the amount of thirty thousand marks, and he grew in
greatness so that not only his own followers but the Moors of Eastern
Spain began to look upon him as their rightful lord.

Beholding his puissance, the Moorish King of Serville grew greatly
afraid, and resolved to bring the whole power of his kingdom against
him. Collecting an army of ten thousand men, he marched against
Valencia. But the Cid encountered him on the banks of the Huerta, and
defeated him so completely that never again was he able to do him
scathe.

The heart of the Cid now began to grow hopeful that his King would
receive him into friendship and confidence once more. And he swore a
great oath that for love of Alfonso he would never let his beard be
shorn. "So," he said, "will my beard be famous among both Moors and
Christians." Once more he sent Alvar

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

Fañez to Court with the gift of a hundred splendidly appointed horses of
the purest Arab blood, praying that he might be permitted to bring his
wife, Donna Ximena, and their daughters, to the possessions which he had
carved out for himself by his good sword.

Meanwhile there had come to Valencia from the East a holy man, one
Bishop Don Jerome, who had heard afar of the prowess of the Cid and
longed to cross swords with the infidel. The Cid was well pleased with
him, and founded a bishopric of Valencia for the doughty Christian,
whose one thought was but to spread the worship of God and slay
Saracens.

When Alvar Fañez reached the Court, he sought audience of King Alfonso,
who was heartened to hear of the deeds of the Campeador, how he had
routed the Moors in five pitched battles, made their lands subject to
the crown of Castile, and erected a bishopric in the heart of paynimne,
so that he readily granted per-mission that Donna Ximena and the ladies
Elvira and Sol should go to Valencia. Hearing this, Count Garcia
Ordoñez, of the Leonese party, who had secured the Cid's banishment and
who cordially hated him, was greatly vexed. But the two Infantes or
Princes of Carrión, in Leon, seeing how the Cid grew in power and
importance, resolved to ask his daughters in marriage from the King, but
meanwhile kept their counsel. The time had long passed when the Cid
should have discharged his debt to the Jews Raquel and Vidas, and
hearing that Alvar Fañez was at Court they came to him and begged that
it might be paid. Fañez assured them that all should be done as the Cid
had promised, and that only stress of constant warfare had kept his
master from fulfilling his obligation to them. They

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

were perfectly satisfied with this assurance, and so greatly had they
trusted the Cid that they had never opened the chests to examine the
nature of the security he had given them.

 

The Cid Welcomes His Family

Alvar Fañez now made ready to set out for Valencia with Donna Ximena and
the Cid's daughters, whom he safely conveyed to their new home. When he
heard that they were near at hand, the Cid, who had only a few days
before won his famous steed Babieca in a skirmish with the Moors, leapt
upon the charger's back, and rode off at a gallop to meet them and
welcome them to their new possessions. Greeting them with much
affection, he led them to the castle, from the towers of which he showed
them the lands he had won for them. And they gave thanks to God for a
gift so fair.

Now there was great stirring among the Moors of Africa when they heard
of the deeds of the Cid, and they held it for dishonour that he should
have redeemed so great a part of Spain from their brothers of the
Peninsula. Their king, Vussef, levied a mighty army of fifty thousand
men, and, crossing the seas to Spain, marched upon Valencia, hoping to
regain it for the Crescent. When the Cid heard this, he exclaimed "I
thank God and the blessed Mother that I have my wife and daughters here.
Now shall they see how we do battle with the Moors and win our bread in
the land of the stranger'." The host of Yussef soon came in sight, and
environed Valencia so closely that none might enter or leave it, and
when the ladies beheld the great army which surrounded the city they
were much afraid. But the Cid bade them be of good cheer. "Hearten ye,"
he

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

said, "for, see, marvellous great wealth conies to us. Here comes a
dowry against the marriage of your daughters!"'  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[8](#fn_33.md)

 

The Battle with King Bucar

Springing upon Babieca, the Cid led his lances against the Moors of
Africa. Then began a contest great and grim. The Spanish spears were red
that day, and the Cid plied his good blade Colada so terribly that the
Saracens fell before his strokes like corn before the sickle. He aimed a
great blow at King Vussef's helm, but the Moorish chieftain, avoiding
it, gave his horse the rein and galloped off the field, his dusky host
following him in head. long rout. Countless was the spoil in gold,
silver, richly caparisoned horses, shields, swords, and body-armour.

Too wearied with ceaseless slaughter to give chase, the Cid rode back to
where his wife and daughters had sat watching the progress of the
battle, his dripping sword in his hand. "Homage to you, ladies," he
cried. "Thus are Moors vanquished on the field of battle." But ever
mindful of his King and liege-lord, he at once dispatched Alvar Fañez
and Pero Bermuez to Court, with the tent of King Vussef and two hundred
horses with their caparisons. Greatly pleased was Alfonso. "I receive
the gift of the Cid willingly," he said, "and may the day of our
reconciliation soon arrive."

The Infantes of Carrión, seeing that the reputation of the Cid increased
daily, were now fully resolved to ask the daughters of the Campeador in
marriage from the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

King. Alfonso agreed to enter into negotiations with the Cid, not only
for the hands of his daughters, but with the idea of effecting a
reconciliation with him, for he was well aware of all the service which
the Campeador had done him. So he sent for Alvar Fañez and Pero Bermuez
and acquainted them with the offer of the Infantes of Carrión,
requesting them to convey it to the Cid without loss of time and
assuring him of his esteem.

The envoys hastened to Valencia and told the Cid how the King had sent
him a gracious message, asking for the hands of his daughters for the
Infantes of Carrión. The Cid was right joyful on hearing this. "What the
King desires is my pleasure," he said, "though the Infantes of Carrión
are haughty, and bad vassals to the Throne. But be it as God and the
King wills."

Then the Campeador made great preparations and set out for the Court,
and when the King knew he was approaching he went out to meet him. And
the Cid went on his knees before the King and took the grass of the
field in his teeth to humble himself before his lord. But Don Alfonso
was troubled at the sight, and, raising him, assured him of his grace
and affection, at which the Cid was greatly moved and wept joyfully.
Then the King feasted the Cid bravely, and when the banquet was at an
end asked for the hands of his daughters for the Infantes of Carrión.
The Cid made reply that he and his daughters were in the King's hands
and that Alfonso himself might give the damsels in marriage.

 

The Cid’s Daughters Wed

After some days spent in feasting and rejoicing, the Campeador returned
to Valencia with the two Infantes

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

of Carrión. He told his wife and daughters that the marriage was of the
King's making and not of his, as he was not without misgivings as to the
result of the alliance. Nevertheless he made great preparations, as
befitted the importance of such a ceremony with two of the greatest
lords in Spain, and Donna Elvira and Donna Sol were espoused to the
Infantes of Carrion in the church Santa Maria by the good warrior-bishop
Jerome. The wedding celebrations lasted fifteen days, and the Cid had no
reason to be dissatisfied with his sons-in-law who bore themselves as
gallantly in the lists as in the dance.

 

The Adventure of the Lion

The Infantes of Carrión and their wives had remained in Valencia for
about two years when a mishap befell. One day, during the time of the
afternoon siesta, a lion, kept for baiting in the ring, broke loose from
its cage and made its way into the palace. The Campeador reclined upon a
couch asleep, but his dauntless followers gathered round him to protect
him, all except the Infantes Carrión, one of whom crept beneath the
couch on which the Cid slept, while the other made such speed to quit
the palace that he fell across the beam of a wine-press and rent his
robes. The clamour awoke the Cid, who rose, and, going to where the lion
crouched, firmly place his hand on the brute's bristling mane and led
him back to his cage. Nor did the lion resist, evidently knowing his
master.

The Infantes of Carrión, when they knew all danger was past, came out of
hiding, looking so pale and terrified that the hardy soldiers of the Cid
could not restrain their laughter. At this the haughty northern grandees
felt

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

deep insult and resentment and an unmanly feeling of revenge awoke in
their hearts.

Within a few days of this incident news reached Valencia that Abu Bekr,
the commander of the armies of the King of Morocco, was marching upon
the city. The Cid and his captains rejoiced at the news, but not so the
Infantes of Carrión, who took counsel together as to how they might
avoid the fighting and return to their own territories.

Here a break occurs in the narrative, and from a later Passage it is
clear that the missing lines relate to a test of the courage of at least
one of the Infantes, who, stung by an imputation of cowardice, armed
himself and set out to fight a Moor, who, however, put him to flight.
But Pero Bermuez, to save the Cid's feelings, slew the Saracen and made
it appear that the Infante had done so.

 

A ‘Secret Service’ Story of "The Cid"

A most romantic tale hangs upon the first line of the next passage

"May the time come when I deserve as much of both of you."

The line is supposed to be the last in the speech of Pero Bermuez to the
Infante Don Ferrando, who had probably expressed gratitude to him. The
first English author to attempt a translation of the *Poema del Cid* was
John Hookham Frere, the translator of the plays of Aristophanes, who was
for some years British Minister at Madrid. He made a conjectural reading
of the above line, which he communicated to the Marquis de la Romana.
Some years later, in 1808, when the Marquis was commanding a body of
troops in the French service in Denmark, Frere was able to accredit a
confidential messenger to him, assuring the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

Spanish commander of the genuineness of the message he carried by
mention of the amended line, the correction in which was known only to
the Marquis himself. The circumstance led to one of the most important
movements in the war against Napoleon.

 

The Fighting Bishop

The Infantes of Carrión, who did not relish the idea of a protracted
struggle with the Moors, resolved to betake themselves to the security
of their own estates at the first opportunity. But, as if to shame them,
warlike Bishop Jerome appeared before the Cid armed cap-à-pie and
entreated his permission to take part the fighting. The Cid smilingly
gave his assent, and no sooner had he done so than the doughty churchman
mounted a great war-horse and, issuing out of the gates, galloped
headlong against the Saracens. At the first onset he slew two of them
outright, but had the misfortune to break his lance. Nothing daunted
however, this ardent disciple of the Church militant, drew his sword
and, brandishing it about his head like a trained knight-at-arms, flung
himself once more upon the Moorish ranks with all the weight of his
charger. Laying about him left and right, he killed or wounded a heathen
with every blow. But the enemy closed round him, and it would have gone
hard indeed with the fighting bishop had not the Cid, who had witnessed
his gallantry with all a warrior's admiration for the deeds of another
brave man, laid his lance in rest and, setting spurs to Babieca, plunged
into the thickest of the fray. Beneath his terrific onset the lightly
armed Moors gave way in terror. Wheeling, he came at them again,
crashing through their ranks

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

like a tempest, and dealing death and destruction wherever he went, The
Moors wavered, broke, and fled amain. The whole army of the Cid now bore
down upon them, horse and man, bursting into their camp, breaking the
tent-ropes, and dashing aside the gaudy Eastern pavilions where they had
lodged.

Upon the terror-stricken ranks the horsemen of Castile  
Came thundering down; King Bucar's men the iron tempest feel. And down
to dust the severed arm, the severed steel-capped head Fall lifeless,
and the charger's hoofs trample the gory dead.  
"Ha! stay, King Bucar!" cries the Cid. "Now tarry, Moorish lord;  
You came to seek me o'er the sea, mine is the peaceful word."  
"If peace is in thy naked sword and in thy charging steed,  
Then I would flee it," cried the King, and spurred his horse to speed.  
With hasty stride the King doth ride straight for the open sea;  
Spain's champion is at his side, never again will he  
Know the delights of Algiers' halls; Colada shines on high:  
Now whether by the sword or sea, King Bucar, wilt thou die?  
The good blade shears the Moor in twain, down to the saddlebow;  
So perished the Algerian lord—may every Moor die so!  
And thus upon this day of fame the Cid his guerdon won,  
Worth many a purse of minted marks, the noble blade Tizon!

Riding back from the fray, the Cid espied the Infantes of Carrión and
welcomed them. "Now that they are brave will they be welcomed by the
brave," he said, rather wistfully, to Alvar Fañez. The proud and shallow
princes were wrathful when they overheard this, and the shadow of
vengeance once more arose within their haughty hearts. " Let us take our
leave of the Cid and return to Carrión," they said. "We have been
flouted and insulted here by these banditti and their leader. On the way
home we shall know how to avenge ourselves upon his daughters."

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

With this cowardly purpose they smilingly requested the Campeador to
permit them to depart. Sorrowfully he granted it, and loading them with
presents and bestowing upon them the famous swords Colada and Tizon,
which he had himself taken in battle from the Moors, he requested Felix
Muñoz, his nephew, to accompany the Infantes and his daughters to
Carrión.

 

The Infantes’ Revenge

Great was the grief of the Cid and Donna Ximena at parting with the
ladies Elvira and Sol, and they were not without some misgivings. But
they charged Feliz Muñoz to keep good watch over their daughters, and
this he promised to do. After journeying for some days the party had to
traverse the great forest of Corpes. where in a glade they pitched
pavilions and spent the night. In the morning the Infantes sent their
suite on ahead, and, taking the saddle-girths from the horses, beat the
unfortunate daughters of the Cid most cruelly. The wretched ladies
begged for death rather than suffer such disgrace, but the cowardly
Infantes, laughing scornfully, mocked them, cast them off, and so dealt
with them that they left them for dead. "Thus," they said, "the
dishonour of the affair of the lion is avenged," and mounting their
horses they rode off.

As the deserted and dishonoured wives of the cowardly pair lay bleeding
on the grass, Feliz Muñoz, their cousin, who had lodged during the night
in another part of the forest, rode up, and seeing their piteous
condition hastened to their relief. Having dressed their hurts to the
best of his ability, he rode quickly to the nearest town and purchased
clothing and horses

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

for them as befitted their station. When these tidings reached the Cid
in Valencia great anger rose in his heart. He did not give it vent,
however, but sat moodily pondering upon the dishonour done to his
daughters. At last, after many hours, he spoke. " By my beard! he cried,
"the Infantes of Carrión shall not profit by this." Soon the ladies Sol
and Elvira arrived at Valencia, and he received them lovingly, but not
compassionately. "Welcome, my daughters," said he. " God keep ye from
evil! I accepted this marriage, for I dared not gainsay it. God grant
that I see you better married hereafter, and that I have my revenge upon
my sons-in-law of Carrión."

 

The Court at Toledo

Then the Cid dispatched messengers to King Alfonso, acquainting him of
the great wrong done to his daughters by the Infantes, and pleading for
justice. The King greatly wroth at the news, and ordered the Court to
sit at Toledo and the Infantes to be summoned before him to answer for
their crime. They begged to be excused attendance, but the King
peremptorily refused to accept any apology or subterfuge, and demanded
their instant compliance with his summons. With great misgivings they
journeyed to Toledo, taking with them the Count Don Garcia, Asur
Gonzalez, Gonzalo Asurez, and a great band of dependents, thinking
thereby to overawe the Cid. The Campeador himself soon arrived at Court,
with many a trusted veteran, all armed to the teeth. He wore a rich robe
of red fur broidered with gold, and his beard was bound with a cord to
preserve it. When he entered the Court with his men all rose to greet
him save the

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

Infantes of Carrión and their party, for he seemed a great baron and the
Infantes might not look at him shame.

"Princes, barons, and hidalgos," said King Aifonso, "I have summoned ye
here that justice may be done the Cid Campeador. As ye all know, foul
wrong has been done his daughters, and I have set judges apart to
moderate in this business and to search out the right for wrong I will
not have in Christian Spain. I swear by the bones of San Isidro that he
who disturbs my Court shall quit my kingdom and forfeit my love, and he
who shall prove his right, on his side am I. Now let the Cid make his
demand and we shall hear the answer of the Infantes of Carrión."

Then rose the Cid, and in the Court among all the great barons and lords
there was no nobler figure. "My lord the King," he said, "it is not I
alone whom the Infantes of Carrión have wronged, but yours also, who
gave them my daughters in marriage. Let them first restore my swords
Colada and Tizon, since they are no longer my sons-in-law."

The Infantes, hearing the Cid speak thus, thought that he would urge no
more against them if they restored the swords, and so they formally
handed them over to the King. But it was the Campeador's intention to
punish them by every means in his power, so when he received the
wondrous falchions from the hands of Alfonso he at once presented them
to Feliz Muñoz and Martin Antolinez, thus showing that it was not for
himself that he desired them. Having done this, he turned once again to
the King.

"My liege," he said, "when the Infantes left Valencia I bestowed upon
them three thousand marks in gold

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

and silver. Let them now restore this, since they are no longer my
sons-in-law."

'Nay, if we do this," cried the Infantes, "we must even pay it out of
our lands in Carrión." But the judges demanded that the sum be paid in
Court without delay. The treacherous princelings could not raise such a
treasure in money, so the Court decided that it must be paid in kind.
Then the Infantes saw that there was help but to acquiesce, and brought
many a steed and trained paifrey with their furniture to repay the Cid,
borrowing from the members of their suite and entering into such
obligations as would burden them for many a day.

 

Redress by Combat

When this matter had at last been settled, the Cid then advanced his
principal grievance against the Infantes, and asked for redress by
combat in the lists for the at wrong they had done his daughters. At
this Count Garcia, their spokesman, rose to defend the Infantes. He
pleaded that they were of princely degree, And for that reason alone
were justified in casting off the daughters of the Cid. Then Ferran
Gonzalez, the elder of the Infantes, himself rose to approve the speech
of his vassal, and cast fresh scorn upon the alliance he had made,
justifying his cowardly action by his princely rank as a thing quite
natural and fitting. At this Pero Bermuez opened the vials of his wrath
upon the Infantes taunting them with cowardice in the affair of the lion
and casting defiance of battle in their teeth.

 

Enter Asur Gonzáles

The argument waxed high, when at that moment Asur Gonzáles, a haughty
vassal of the Infantes, entered the hall.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

With early viands and with wine flushed were his face and brow,  
Disordered were his garments and his mantle hung full low.  
He scanned the Court with bearing rude, right clownish was his vaunt:  
"How now, my lords? What have we here? Thinkst Carrión to daunt?  
What bruit is this about the Cid, the lordling of Bivar?  
At drawing tithes from dusty millers better is he far  
Than ruffling at a Cortés; he to match with Carrión  
Then up leapt Muño Gustioz: "Ha' done, thou knave, ha' done!  
Drunkard, who lookest on the wine before ye tell a bead,  
Who never yet did keep thy troth, evil in word and deed,  
The only boon I crave is but to have thee where my sword  
May cut the false tongue from thy throat and cease thy lying word,"  
"Enough, enough," Alfonso cried, "I give thee my consent  
To meet each other in the lists; so ends this Parliament."

The tumult which the King had endeavoured to abate had hardly died away
when two cavaliers entered the Court. The new-comers were ambassadors
from the Infantes of Navarre and Aragon, who had come to request the
King to bestow the hands of the Cid's daughters upon their masters.
Alfonso turned to the Cid and requested his permission to ratify the
marriage at once, and when the Campeador had humbly given his consent he
answered to the assembled nobles that the espousals would duly take
place, adding that the combat between the disputants would be fought out
on the morrow.

This was right woeful news to the Infantes of Carrión, who, in great
fear, requested him to permit them some delay to procure fitting horses
and arms, so that at last the King scornfully fixed the day of combat at
three weeks from that date, and the place where it was to be fought out
as Carrión itself, so that the Infantes should have no grounds of excuse
for absence or be able to

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

plead that the champions of the Cid had been granted any undue
advantage.

The Cid then took his leave of the King, and on parting pressed him to
accept his courser Babieca. But Alfonso refused the proffered gift,
saying courteously that if he accepted it Babieca would not have so good
a lord. Turning to those who were to uphold his cause in the lists, the
Campeador bade them an affectionate farewell, and so he departed for
Valencia, and the King for Carrión to see justice done.

 

The Trial by Combat

When the time of truce was over the contending parties sought the lists.
The Cid's men did not waste much time in arming themselves, but the
treacherous Infantes of Carrión had brought with them a number of their
vassals in the hope that they might be able to slay the Cid's champions
by night, when they were off their guard. But Antolinez and his comrades
kept good watch and frustrated their design. When they saw that there
was no help for it but to meet their challengers *à outrance*, they
prayed the King that the Cid's men might not be permitted to use the
famous swords Colada and Tizon, for they superstitiously dreaded the
trenchancy of these marvellous weapons, and bitterly repented that they
had restored them. Alfonso, however, refused to listen to this appeal.

"Ye have swords of your own," he said brusquely. "Let them suffice you,
and see that you wield them like men, for, believe me, there will be no
shortcoming on the side of the Campeador."

The trumpets sounded and the Cid's three champions leapt upon their
impatient destriers, first having made

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

the sign of the Cross upon their saddles. The Infantes of Carrión also
mounted, but none so blithely. The marshals or heralds who were to
decide the rules of combat, and give judgment in case of dispute, took
their places. Then said King Alfonso: "Hear what I say, Infantes of
Carrión. This combat ye should have fought at Toledo, but ye would not,
so I have brought these three cavaliers in safety to the land of
Carrión. Take your right; seek no wrong: who attempts it ill betide
him."

The description of the scene that follows has more than once been
compared with Chaucer's description of combat between Palamon and Arcite
in *The Knight’s Tale*, and, as will be seen, a resemblance certainly
exists. <span id="fr_34"></span>[9](#fn_34.md)

And now the marshals quit the lists and leave them face to face  
Their shields are dressed before their breasts, their lances are
place.  
Each charger's flank now feels the spur, each helm is bending low  
The earth doth shake as horse and man hurl them upon the foe.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

The echo of their meeting is a sound of meikle dread,  
And all who hear the deadly shock count them as good as sped.  
The false Ferrando and Bermuez strike lance on either's shield,  
The Infante’s spear goes through the boss, but the stout shaft doth
yield  
And splinters ere the point can pass thorough the other's mail.  
But Pero's shaft struck home, nor did the seasoned timber fail;  
It pierced Ferrando's corselet and sank into his breast,  
And to the trampled ground there drooped the Infant's haughty crest.  
Bermuez then drew Tizon's bright blade; ere ever he could smite  
The Infant yielded him and cried, "Thou hast the victor's right."

While this combat was proceeding Antolinez and the other Infante came
together. Each of their lances smote the other's shield and splintered.
Then, drawing their swords, they rode fiercely against one another.
Antolinez, flourishing Colada, struck so mightily at Diego that the good
blade shore its way clean through the steel plates of his casque, and
even cut half the hair from Diego's head. The terrified princeling
wheeled his courser and fled, but Antolinez pursued him with mock fury
and struck him across the shoulders with the flat of his sword. So had
the hound the chastisement of cowards. As he felt the blade across his
withers Diego shrieked aloud and spurred past the boundaries of the
lists, thus, according to the rules of the combat, admitting himself
vanquished.

When the trumpets of the pursuivants sounded, Muño Gustioz and Asur
Gonzalez ran swiftly and fiercely together. The point of Astir's spear
glanced off Muño's armour, but that of the Cid's champion pierced the
shield of his opponent and drove right through his breast, so that it
stuck out a full fathom between the shoulder-blades. The haughty Asur
fell

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

heavily to the ground, but had enough of life left in him to beg for
mercy.

King Alfonso then duly credited the Cid's champion, with the victory,
and without loss of time they returned to Valencia to acquaint their
master with the grand news that his honour had been avenged. Shortly
afterward the espousals of the Cid's daughters to the noble Infantes of
Navarre and Aragon were celebrated with much pomp. The *Poema del Cid*,
however, concludes as abruptly as it begins:

So in Navarre and Aragon his daughters both did reign,  
And princes of his blood to-day sit on the thrones of Spain.  
Greater and greater grew his name in honour and in worth;  
At last upon a Pentecost he passed away from earth.  
Upon him be the grace of Christ, Whom all of us adore.  
Such is the story, gentles, of the Cid Campeador.

 

The Real Cid

Cervantes' summing-up upon the *Poema del Cid* is perhaps the sanest on
record. The Cid certainly existed in the flesh: what matter, then,
whether his achievements occurred or not? For the Cid of romance is a
very different person from the Cid of history, who was certainly a born
leader of men, but crafty, unscrupulous, and cruel. The *Poema* is thus
romance of no uncertain type, and as this book deals with romance and
not with history, there is small need in this place to provide the
reader with a chronicle of the rather mercenary story of Roderigo of
Bivar the real.

"Mio Cid," the title under which he is most frequently mentioned, is a
half Arabic, half Spanish rendering of the Arabic *Sid-y*, "My lord," by
which he was probably known to his Moorish subjects in Valencia, and it
is

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

unlikely that he was given this appellation in Spain during his
lifetime. But to this day it is a name to conjure with in the Peninsula.
So long as the heart of the Briton beats faster at the name Arthur and
the Frenchman is thrilled by the name of Roland the Spaniard will not
cease to reverence that of the great romantic shadow which looms above
the early history of his land like a very god of war—the Cid Campeador.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[55:1](lrs04.htm#fr_25.md) Ormsby (*The Poem of the
Cid*), who wrote in 1879, seems to have had the most elementary notions
of what a *cantar* was, and states that the Poema "was nearly
contemporary with the first *chansons de gestes*." Hut he is probably at
least a century out in his reckoning, as the first chansons date from
about the middle of the eleventh century. Of *trovador* and *juglar* he
had evidently never heard. Yet he is anything but superficial, and on
the whole his book is the best we have in English on the *Poema*. It is
unlucky, too, as Saintsbury remarks, that neither Ticknor nor Southey,
who wrote so widely on ancient Spanish

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

literature, were acquainted with the *chansons de gestes*. Still more
luck- less is it that so much in the way of Spanish translation was left
to Longfellow, who shockingly mangled and Bowdlerized many fine ballads.
Probably no poet was so well qualified as he to divest a ballad of all
pith and virility in the course of translation. Bad as are his Spanish
renderings, however, they are adequate when compared with his exploits
in the field of Italian translation.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[57:2](lrs04.htm#fr_26.md) See his *Poema del Cid*
(1898).

<span id="fn_27"></span>[57:3](lrs04.htm#fr_27.md) See Manuel Rivadeneyra,
*Biblioteca de Autores españoles* , vol. xvi (1846-80).

<span id="fn_28"></span>[57:4](lrs04.htm#fr_28.md) A good deal of
controversy has arisen. concerning the metre of the *Poema*. Professor
Cornu of Prague (see M. Gaston Paris, in *Romania* , xxii, pp. 153, 531)
has stated that the basis of it is the ballad octo-syllable,<span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> full or catalectic, arranged as hemistichs of
a longer line, but this theory presupposes that the copyists of the
original MS. must have mistaken such a simple measure, which is scarcely
credible. Professor Saintsbury ( *Flourishing of Romance*, p. 403) gives
it as his opinion that "nobody has been able to get further in a
generalization of the metre than that the normal form is an eight and
six (better a seven and seven) ’ fourteener,’ trochaically cadenced, but
admitting contraction and extension with a liberality elsewhere
unparalleled." No absolute system of assonance or rhyme appears, and we
are almost forced to the conclusion that the absence of this is in a
measure due to the kind offices of Abbot Pedro.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[61:\*](lrs04.htm#fr_29.md) TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE:
Spanish *Doña* = "Lady." Pronounced as *don’yah*.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[62:5](lrs04.htm#fr_30.md) By this phrase the Cid
seems to have been widely known in appears to have served him as a sort
of cognomen or nickname.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[65:6](lrs04.htm#fr_31.md) The passage in the
*Poema del Cid* which tells of the combat that followed has perhaps a
better right than any other in the epic to the title 'Homeric.' 'The
translation which I furnish of it may not he so exact as those of Frere
or Ormsby. But although I am only too conscious of its many
shortcomings, I cannot bring myself to make Se of the pedestrian
preciseness of the one or the praiseworthy version f the other of my
predecessors, both of which, in my view, fail to

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

render the magnificent spirit and chivalric dash of the original. All
that I can claim for my own translation is that is that it does not fail
so utterly in this regard. I have in places attempted the restoration of
lines which seemed to me omitted or coalesced with others, and I must
admit that this rendering of a great passage is more consciously
artificial than the others—a fault which I am unable to rectify. But
allowance must be made for the rendition of such a passage, and the
whole must be accepted by the reader *foute de mieux*.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[70:7](lrs04.htm#fr_32.md) Throughout the *Poema*
and elsewhere the Cid is constantly alluded to as ‘Mio Cid" ("My lord").
I deal with the etymology of the name farther, but hold to the form "the
Cid" as being most familiar to English readers.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[74:8](lrs04.htm#fr_33.md) This passage is
reminiscent of the saying of the famous Border outlaw Jock Eliot, when
he and his men came upon a large haystack of which they resolved to make
fodder for their horses. "Eh, man," exclaimed the humorous raider, "if
ye had legs, wouldna' ye run!"

<span id="fn_34"></span>[86:9](lrs04.htm#fr_34.md) The commencement of the
passage in question is as follows (1741-50)

The heraldz laften here prikyng up and doun  
Now ryngede the tromp and clarioun  
Ther is no more to say, hot est and west  
In goth the speres ful sadly in arrest  
Ther seen men who can juste, and who can ryde  
In goth the scharpe spore into the side,  
Thee schyveren schaftes upon schuidres thykke  
He feeleth through the herte-spon the prikke  
Up sprengen speres on twenty foot on hight  
Out goon the swerdea as the silver height.

The balance is, however, greatly in favour of Chaucer, whose lines, *if
properly* *accented*, beat the original Spanish on its own ground, and
this notwithstanding the absurd remark of Swinburne that "Chaucer and
Spenser scarcely made a good poet between them."
