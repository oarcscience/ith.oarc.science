THE word *romancero* in modern Spanish is more or less strictly applied
to a special form of verse composition, a narrative poem written in
lines of sixteen syllables which adhere to one single assonance
throughout. Originally the term was applied to those dialects or
languages which were the offspring of the Roman or Latin tongue-the
spoken language of old Rome in its modernized forms. Later it came to
imply only the written forms of those vernaculars, and lastly the poetic
lyrico-narrative form alone, as above indicated. The *romancero*
therefore differs from the romance in that it is written in verse, and
it is plain from what has just been said that the name romance was the
product of the transition period when the term was intended to describe
the written output of the more modern forms of Latin-Castilian,
Portuguese, French, and Provençal, whether couched in prose or verse. We
have seen that practically all the romances proper, as apart from the
*cantares* *de gesta—*that is, such compositions as *Amadis, Palmerin,*
and *Partenopex—*were written in prose. But the *romancero* was first
and last a narrative in verse. Indeed, the three tales recounted in the
last chapter are of the *romancero* type—a form, as we shall see, which
gained quite as strong a hold upon the lower classes of the Peninsula as
the romance proper did upon the affections of the *hidalgo* and the
*caballero.* In a word, the *romancero* is the popular ballad of Spain.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

In a previous chapter I attempted to outline the several types of the
Spanish ballad, or *romancero,* as follows:

(1)   Those of spontaneous popular origin and early date.

(2)   Those based upon passages in the chronicles or

cantares de gesta.

(3)   Folk-ballads of a relatively late date.

(4)   Those later ballads which were the production of conscious art.

We can thus class Spanish ballads more broadly into:

(5)   Those of popular origin.

(6)   Those which have their rise in literary sources.

As regard class (1) of the first quaternion, like Sancho Panza I have no
intention of indicating how old these may be. The fiercest controversy
has raged round this question, but, as I have already indicated, it
would be strange indeed if no vestiges of early Castilian folk-song had
come down to us in an altered form. Folk-song, in my view, has as great
a chance of survival as custom or legend, and we know how persistent
these are in undisturbed areas, so I see no reason to doubt that a
certain number of the original ballads of Spain have come down to us in
such an altered form as would, perhaps, render them unrecognizable to
their makers, just as the ancient Scottish romance of *Thomas the
Rhymer* would not have been recognized in its later form by the singer
who composed it.

All the arguments, archeological and philological, erected and advanced
by mere erudition will not convince me to the contrary. To some people
antiquity is a living

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

thing, a warm and glowing environment, a world with the paths and
manners of which they are better acquainted than with the streets of
every day. To others it is—a museum. I have no quarrel with the curators
of that museum, and I enjoy reading their books-records of a land which
few of then have visited. But when they insist upon controverting the
evidence supplied by senses which they do not possess they become merely
tiresome. Like art, archeology has also its inspirations, its higher
vision. Alas that those who do not share it should attempt to justify
their conclusions by lifeless logic alone!

Therefore I shall say no more concerning the age of the ballads of Old
Spain, but will only remark with Sancho that "they are too old to lie."
I have clearly shown, too, that a number of them were based on passages
in the chronicles and *cantares,* a circumstance which in itself vouches
for their relative antiquity. With the later artificial imitations of
Góngora and Lope de Vega, and others of similar stamp, we are not
concerned here. After all, we can only take the ballads of Spain as we
find them in the *cancioneros.* It is much too late in the day now to do
anything else. Like the ballads of Scotland and Denmark, those of Spain
have been collected and published for centuries, and in the pages of the
*cancioneros* old and new, popular and literary, are mingled together in
almost inextricable confusion. Let us glance, then, at the history of
these *cancioneros,* these treasure-houses of a people's poetry, and
attempt to realize their plan and scope as perhaps the best method by
which to approach the subject of the Spanish ballad generally. Having
done this, we can then discuss matters of origin with critics of insight
and sympathy.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

The "Cancionero General"

If we except the fragmentary collection of Juan Fernandez de
Constantina, the *Cancionero General,* or "Universal Song-book," as it
might be translated, was originally brought together and published at
the beginning of the sixteenth century by a certain Fernando del
Castillo. The arrangement of the ballads it contains is neither
chronological nor thoroughly systematic, although the productions of
each author are kept distinct. Later editions of this work quickly
multiplied, and as the collection extended the additions were always
inserted at the end of the book. The collection consists for the most
part of the ballads of authors of the fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries, such as Tallante, Nicolas Nuñez, Juan de Mena, Porticarrero,
and the still earlier Marquis de Santillana.

The first portion of the work is confined to the spiritual songs *(obras
de devoción).* These are monotonous and informed with a rigid
fanaticism. Nor are the "Moral Poems" which follow any more attractive,
allegorizing virtues and vices according to the definitions of
scholastic philosophy. The amatory verses in the collection are more
ingenious than truly poetic; they lack true feeling, and appear stiff
and artificial in their reiteration of burning passion and the
overwhelming woes of unrequited love, mingled with pseudo-philosophical
appeals to reason. But gay and graceful love songs are not lacking, as,
for example, the "Muy mas clara que de luna" of Juan de Meux or the
"Pensamienti, pues mostrays" of Diego Lopez de Haro. But these trail off
into philosophical disquisition, and the tender sentiment in which they
were conceived and commenced is lost in the shallows of paltry argument.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

Much more promising are the *canciones,* or lyrical poems of a
semi-conventional cast, which have a character and metrical form all
their own. They usually consist of twelve lines, divided into two parts.
The first four lines comprehend the idea on which the song is founded,
and this is developed or applied in the eight succeeding lines. The
*Cancionero General* contains one hundred and fifty-six of these little
songs, some of which are the best poems contained in it, and perhaps
they owe their excellence to the verbal restraint which their form
compels. An allied form is the *villancico,* or conceit, usually of
three or four lines, a fugitive piece, enshrining some fleeting emotion,
and often packed with the matter of poesy.

 

The "Romancero General"

The title *Romancero General* was applied to many collections of Spanish
songs and narrative romances in verse published during the seventeenth
century and later. Of these only the older require illustration here.
The first in point of date was the collection of Miguel de Madrigal,
published in 1604, although another work containing upward of a thousand
romances and songs was produced in the same year, and bears the same
title. Another collection of primary importance is that of Pedro de
Flores (1614). This is obviously a bookseller's compilation, but is none
the worse for that, save that it pretends to embrace the entire sum of
Spanish *romanceros,* whereas it contains not one of those appearing in
the *Cancionero General.* All of these works contain numerous amatory
poems of the kind so liberally exemplified in the *Cancionero General,*
but with these we have little concern, and our attention

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

may be better employed in examining the *romancero* proper which it
contains. These for the most part would seem to belong to the fifteenth
century, an relate to the civil wars of Granada, the last Moons
principality in Spain, and the heroic and gallant adventures of Moorish
knights. It is, indeed, in this work that we first perceive the trend
toward a literary fashion in things Moorish to which we have referred in
previous chapter, but, as has been indicated, this is very far from
saying that these poems owe their origin t Moorish models. But there are
not wanting Castilian themes and stories, such as those relating to
Roderic, Bernaldo de Carpio, Fernán Gonzalez, the Infantes of Lara, and
the Cid. Most of these were written by men of humble station, the true
poets of the people, the latter representatives of those *juglares* who
had sung or recited the

cantares de gesta.

Mr. James Fitzmaurice Kelly is at once the best informed and most
sympathetic of modern critics on the subject of the *romancero.* In his
admirable *Chapters on Spanish Literature,* a delightful series of
excursions into several of the most interesting provinces of Spanish
letters, he reviews the *romancero* in some forty vivid pages,
remarkable alike for critical insight and the sanity of the conclusions
to which they point. Taking Lockhart's *Spanish Ballads* as a basis for
comment, he addresses

Besides the collection of romances alluded to, which may be said to
represent the standard sources of the subject, collections were
published at Antwerp and Saragossa, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, by Martin Nucio and Esteban de Ntjera respectively. The reader
may also consult the *Primavera y Fior de Romance,* by Wolf and Hofman,
in the reprint published by Senor Menéndez y Pelayo, the collection of
Lepping (two vols., Leipzig, 1844), and the English translations of
Lockhart and Bowring.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

himself to the racy criticism of the collection of the Scottish
translator. A better plan for the initiation of the English-speaking
reader into the mysteries of the *romancero* could scarcely be
conceived, for there are few who possess no acquaintance with Lockhart's
work, one of the most persistent of the drawing-room books of Victorian
days. Following Mr. Kelly's admirable lead1 then, though not in the
spirit of base imitation, let us take Lockhart as our 'document' and
examine the more interesting of his translations, not only as regards
their subject-matter, but their excellences and shortcomings, comparing
them also with those of Bowring and others. Following Depping, Lockhart
divides his volume of ballads into three sections: Historical, Moorish,
and Romantic. With the first two groups of poems, or rather with their
subject-matter-those relating to King Roderic and Bernaldo de Carpio-we
have dealt elsewhere.

 

The Maiden Tribute

The next in order, "The Maiden Tribute," deals with a demand of the
Moorish monarch Abderahman that a hundred Christian virgins should
annually be delivered into his hands. King Ramíro refused to comply with
such a shameful custom, and marched to meet the Moor. A two days' battle
was fought near Alveida, and at the conclusion of the first day's
hostilities the superior discipline of the Saracens had told heavily
against the Castilians. During the night, St lago, the patron saint of
Spain, appeared to the King in a vision and promised his aid in the
field next day. With morning the battle was joined once more, the Saint,
true to his word, led the Spanish charge, and the Saracens were cast
into headlong rout. The maiden tribute was never afterward paid.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

Lockhart's ballad, or rather translation, certainly does not enhance the
original.

If the Moslem must have tribute, make *men* your tribute-money,  
Send idle drones to tease them within their hives of honey,

is the commonest of crambo, and

Must go, like all the others, the proud Moor's bed to sleep in—  
In all the rest they're useless, and nowise worth the keeping,

is reminiscent of the pantomime days of our youth. Mr. Fitzmaurice Kelly
contents himself by remarking about this ballad that it scarcely calls
for comment.

 

Count Fernán Gonzalez

The Escape of the Count Fernán Gonzalez, which is based on the old
*Estoria del noble caballero Fernán González,"* a popular arrangement of
the *Crónica General* (1 344), is later than two other ballads which Mr.
Kelly and others believe represent a lost epic which was worked into the
*Crónica* in question. A wealth of legend certainly clustered round the
name of this cavalier, and be has a string of *romanceros* to his
credit. But are we to believe that in every case where ballads
crystallize round a great name these are the broken lights of a
disintegrated epic, worn down by attrition into popular songs? Is there,
indeed, irrefragable proof that such a process ever took place anywhere?
Or its reverse, for that matter? Practical writers of verse (if a writer
of verse can be practical) do not take kindly to the hypothesis. They
recognize the generic differences between the spirit of epic and that of
folk-poetry, and prefer to believe that when both have fixed upon the
same subject the choice was fortuitous and not necessarily evolutionary.

Fernán Gonzalez of Castile owed not a little of his

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

romantic reputation to his wife, who delivered him from captivity on at
least two occasions. On that celebrated in the ballad she played the
part of a faithful lover and a true heroine. Gonzalez, taken by his
enemies, had been carried to a stronghold in Navarre. A Norman knight
passing through that country requested the governor of the castle for an
audience with the captive, and as he offered a suitable bribe the
official gladly conceded the request. The interview over, the knight
departed and sought the palace of King Garcia of Navarre, who held
Gonzalez in bondage. One of the counts against the prisoner seems to
have been that he had asked Garcia for the hand of his daughter, and to
this princess, who secretly loved the captive, the knight now addressed
himself:

The Moors may well be joyful, but great should be our grief,  
For Spain has lost her guardian when Castile has lost her chief.  
The Moorish host is pouring like a river o'er the land:  
Curse on the Christian fetters that bind Gonzalez/ hand!

At 'mirk of night' the Infanta rose, and, proceeding alone to the castle
where Gonzalez was confined, proffered such a heavy bribe to the
governor to set him at liberty that he permitted his prisoner to go
free. But the hero was still hampered by his chains, and when the pair
were stopped by a hunter-priest who threatened to reveal their
whereabouts to the King's foresters unless the Infanta paid him a
shameful ransom, Gonzalez was unable to punish him as he deserved. But
as the wretch embraced the princess she seized him by the throat, and
Gonzalez grasped the spear which he had let fall and drove it through
his body. Shortly afterward they encountered a band of Gonzalez' own
men-at-arms, with which incident their night of adventure came to a
close.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

The Infantes of Lara

Few Spanish *romanceros* celebrate incidents more tragic or memorable
than those which cluster round the massacre of the unfortunate Infantes
or Princes of Lara by their treacherous uncle, Ruy or Roderigo
Velasquez. Mr. Fitzmaurice Kelly thinks that one of these originated
from a lost epic written between 1268 and 1344, "or perhaps from a lost
recast of this lost epic." Strange that such epics should *all* be lost!
He pleads that Lockhart might have utilized other more 'energetic'
ballads to illustrate this legend, but I think in this does some despite
to the very fine and spirited translation entitled "The Vengeance of
Mudara ":

As I read these lines I recall a big drawing-room, the narrow casements
of which look upon. a wilderness of garden woodland made magical by the
yellow shadows of the hour when it is neither evening nor afternoon.
Upon a table of mottled rosewood lies a copy of the *Spanish Ballads* in
the embossed and fretted binding of the days when such books were given
as presents and intended for exhibition. A child of ten, I had stolen
into this Elysium redolent of rose-leaves and potpourri, and, opening
the book at random, came upon the lines just quoted. For the first time
I tasted the delights of rhythm, of music in words. The verses
photographed themselves on my brain. Searching through the book until
darkness fell, it seemed to me that I could find nothing so good,
nothing that swung along with such a gallop. But the cup had been held
to my lips, and my

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

days and nights became a quest for words wedded to music. I had to look
for some time before I encountered anything better than, or equal to,
the haunting rhythm of "The Vengeance of Mudara." The years have brought
discoveries beside which the first pales into insignificance, adventures
in books of a spirit more noble, carrying the thrill if a keener
amazement; but none came with the force of such revelation as was
vouchsafed by that page in an unforgotten book in an unforgotten room.

The first of the ballads in which Lockhart deals with the subject of the
Infantes of Lara—for the one we have been discussing follows it is
entitled "The Seven Heads and details the circumstance of the massacre
of the unhappy princes. From the *Historia de España* of Juan de Marinia
(1537-1624) we learn that in the year 986 Ruy Velásquez, lord of
Villaren, celebrated his marriage with Donna Lombra, a lady of high
birth, at Burgos. The festivities were on a scale of great splendour,
and among the guests were Gustio Gonzalez, lord of Salas of Lara, and
his seven sons. These young men, of the blood of the Counts of Castile,
were celebrated for their chivalric prowess, and had all been knighted
on the self. same day.

As evil chance would have it, a quarrel arose between Gonzalez, the
youngest of the seven brothers, and one Alvar Sanchez, a relation of the
bride. Donna Lombra thought herself insulted, and in order to avenge
herself, when the young knights rode in her train as she took her way to
her lord's castle, she ordered one of her slaves to throw at Gonzalez a
wild cucumber soaked in blood, "a heavy insult and outrage, according to
the then existing customs and opinions of Spain." What this I

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

recondite insult signified does not matter. But surely, whatever its
meaning, and making all allowance for the rudeness of the age of which
she was an ornament, the lady did greater despite to herself than to her
enemy by the perpetration of such an act of crude vulgarity. The slave,
having done as he was bid, fled for protection to his mistress's side.
But that availed him nothing, for the outraged Infantes slew him "within
the very folds of her garment."

Ruy Velásquez, burning with Latin anger at what he deemed an insult to
his bride, and therefore to himself, was determined upon a dreadful
vengeance. But he studiously concealed his intention from the young
noblemen, and behaved to them as if nothing of moment had occurred. Some
time after these events he sent Gustio Gonzalez, the father of the seven
young champions, on a mission to Cordova, the ostensible object of which
was to receive on his behalf a tribute of money from the Moorish king of
that city. He made Gustio the bearer of a letter in Arabic, which he
could not read, the purport of which was a request to the Saracen
chieftain to have him executed. But the infidel displayed more humanity
than the Christian, and contented himself with imprison mg the
unsuspecting envoy.

In furtherance of his plans Velásquez pretended to make an incursion
into the Moorish country, in which he was accompanied by the Infantes of
Lara with two hundred of their followers. With fiendish ingenuity he
succeeded in leading them into an ambuscade. Surrounded on all sides by
the Saracen host, they resolved to sell their lives at the highest
possible price rather than surrender. Back to back they stood, taking a
terrible toll of Moorish lives, and one by one they fell, slain but

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

unconquered. Their heads were dispatched to Velásquez as an earnest of a
neighbourly deed by the Moorish king, and were paraded before him and in
front of their stricken father, who had been released in order that
Velásquez might gloat over his grief. When he had satisfied his
vengeance the lord of Villaren permitted the stricken father to return
to his empty home.

But Ruy Velásquez was not destined to go unpunished. While Gustio
Gonzalez had been imprisoned in the dungeons of the Moorish King of
Cordova he had contracted an alliance with that monarch's sister, by
whom he had a son, Mudarra. When this young man had1 attained the age of
fourteen years his mother prevailed upon him to go in search of his
father, and when he had found his now aged parent he learned of the act
of treachery by which his brothers had been slain. Determined to avenge
the cowardly deed, he bided his time, and, encountering Ruy Velásquez
when on a hunting expedition, slew him Out of hand. Gathering, around
him a band of resolute men, he attacked the castle of Villaren, and
executed a fearful vengeance upon the haughty Donna Lombra, whom he
stoned and burnt at the stake. In course of time he was adopted by his
father's wife, Donna Sancha, who acknowledged him as heir to the estates
of his father.

We have already indicated the stirring nature of the ballad in which
Mudarra takes vengeance upon the slayers of his brethren. Its
predecessor in Lockhart's collection, that in which the agonized father
beholds the seven heads of his murdered sons, falls far short of it in
power.

The Wedding of the Lady Theresa

"The Wedding of the Lady Theresa " is a semi-historical ballad which
tells of the forced alliance of a Christian maiden to a noble worshipper
of Mahoun. Alfonso, King of Leon, desirous of strengthening his alliance
with the infidel, intended to sacrifice his sister, Donna Theresa, to
his political necessities. He paved the way for this betrayal by
pretending that Abdalla, King of the Moors, had become a Christian, and
by indicating to her the benefits of a union with the pagan prince.
Totally deceived by these representations, the lady consented to the
match, was taken to Toledo, and wed to the Moor with much splendour. But
on the day of the marriage she learned of her brother's perfidy, and
when she found herself alone with the Moorish lord she repulsed him,
telling him that she would never be a wife to him in aught but name
until he and his people embraced the Christian faith. But Abdalla
ridiculed her scruples, and took advantage of her unprotected state. As
she had prophesied, a scourge fell upon him as the consequence of his
wicked act. Terrified, he

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

sent Theresa back to her brother, with an abundance of treasure, and she
entered the monastery of St Pelagius in Leon, where she passed the
remainder of her days in pious labours and devotions.

This ballad is no earlier than the sixteenth century, a seems to be
based upon historic fact, and, as Mr.. Fitzmaurice Kelly points out, it
confuses Almanzor and the Toledan governor Abdalla on the one hand and
Alfonso V of Leon with his father, Bermudo II, on the other, and
introduces chronological difficulties. Passing by the ballads of the
Cid, to the subject-matter of which we have already done ample justice,
we come to that of

 

Garcia Pérez de Vargas

This Mr.. Fitzmaurice Kelly dismisses in a word although it seems to me
to merit some attention. De Vargas distinguished himself greatly at the
siege Seville in the year 1248. One day, while riding by the banks of
the river, accompanied only by a single companion, he was attacked by a
party of seven mounted Moors. His comrade rode off, but Pérez, closing
his visor, and setting his lance in rest, faced the paynim warriors.
They, seeing who awaited them, made speed back to their own lines. As he
made his way back to camp Pérez noticed that he had dropped his scarf,
and immediately returned to seek for it. But

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

although he rode far into the danger zone ere he found it, the Moors
still avoided him, and he returned to the Spanish camp in safety. The
ballad makes Pérez recover the scarf from the Moors, who had found it
and "looped it on a spear."

Pedro the Cruel

We come now to those ballads which recount the vivid but sanguinary
history of Don Pedro the Cruel. Many attempts have been made to prove
that Pedro was by no means such an inhuman monster as the balladeers
would have us believe. But probability seems to be on the side of the
singers rather than on that of the modern historians, who have done
their best to remove the stain of his ferocious acts from Pedro's
abhorred name. His first act of atrocity was that celebrated in the
ballad entitled "The Master of St lago," which refers to his
illegitimate brother. On the death of that nobleman, his father, well
aware of Pedro's vindictive temperament, fled to the city of Coimbra, in
Portugal. But, believing

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

Pedro's asseverations that he had no intention of offering him violence,
he accepted his invitation to the Court of Seville, where a gallant
tournament was about to be held. No sooner had he arrived, however, than
he was secretly put to death (1358), it is believed at the instance of
the notorious Maria de Padilla, Pedro's mistress.

The ballad recounts how Pedro, relenting somewhat, imprisoned the false
Maria de Padilla, but there is no evidence that she either suggested the
crime or suffered for it. Mr. Fitzmaurice Kelly gives it as his opinion
that the dramatic power of the romance is undeniable. Had he spoken of
its melodramatic power I might feel inclined to agree with him.

"That Pedro was accessory to the violent death of the young and innocent
princess whom he had married, and immediately afterward deserted for
ever, there can be no doubt," says Lockhart, referring to the marriage
of; Pedro with Blanche de Bourbon. But whether he murdered his queen or
not, his paramour, Maria de Padilla, was innocent of all complicity in
the affair,; although the ballad makes her the instigator of the; horrid
deed, and it is plain that the poems which refer to her were written
with a sinister political motive.

Mariana, who is sufficiently reliable, states that Pedro's conduct
toward his queen had aroused the anger of many of his nobles, who
presented him with a remonstrance

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

in writing. His fierce and homicidal temper aroused to fury at what he
considered an unwarranted interference in his private concerns, he
immediately gave the order that his unfortunate French consort should be
put to death by poison in the prison where she was confined. The poem
makes Pedro and his paramour plot upon the death of the unhappy Queen in
the crude manner of the balladeer all the world over.

With the example of many enchanted passages of allusion no less
recondite occurring in the ballads of his own country-side, Lockhart
might reasonably have been expected to have done much better than the
last couplet.

But I question if folk-poetry ever captured a lilt more exquisite than
that of the first four lines of" The Gardener"

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

or a sharper note of anguish than that of the last quatrain.  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) To me at least Old Scots must always
remain the language of the ballad *par excellence,* by virtue of the
subtlety, the finely wrought and divinely coloured wealth of expressive
idiom which bursts from its treasure-chest in a profusion of begemmed
enamelled richness, more various, more magical than any Spanish gold.
Much of this Lockhart filched to give his Castilian bullion a replating.
But in places he falls back most wretchedly upon the poetical trickeries
of his day, falls to the level of Rogers and Southey, to the miserable
devices and tinsel beggary of those bravely bound annuals beloved by the
dames and damsels of the day before yesterday. In places, however, he
out-ballads the ballad in pure

gaucherie.

The next, and not the last of the series, as Mr. Fitzmaurice Kelly has
it, is obviously the handiwork of Walter Scott, than whom none could
fail more miserably on occasion. We can picture him doling "The Death of
Don Pedro" from out the great thesaurus of his brain (that sadly drained
mint, ever at the service of a friend or a publisher), as a dinted and
defaced coin. Only in the last verse does the old fire blaze up.

On such a subject the composer of "Bonnie Dundee" might well have felt
the blood run faster, and the pen

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

quiver in his fingers like an arrow on a tightened bowstring. Two royal
brothers strive with hateful poniards for each other's lives. Pedro, a
prisoner in the hands of Henry of Trastamara, his natural brother, is
wantonly insulted by the victorious noble, and replies by flying at his
throat in an outburst of animal courage and kingly rage. Dumbfounded at
the death-struggle of monarch and usurper, Henry's allies look on, among
them the great Du Guesclin. Pedro pins the lord of Trastamara to the
ground. His dagger flashes upward. Du Guesclm turns to Henry's squire.
"Will ye let your lord die thus, you who eat his bread?" he scoffs. The
esquire throws himself upon Pedro, clings to his arms and turns him
over, and, thus aided, Henry rises, searches for a joint in the King's
armour, and thrusts his dagger deep into that merciless heart. The
murderer, the friend of Jew and Saracen, is slain. His head is hacked
off, and his proud body trampled beneath mailed feet. Surely a subject
for a picture painted in the lights of armour and the red 'shadows of
blood

They had better have let the ballad alone, those two at Abbotsford. It
does not seem to me " a very striking ballad," as Mr. Fitzmaurice Kelly
observes, but in its Castilian dress it is sufficiently dramatic and
exciting.

So run the first two verses, which I leave the reader to translate for
himself, lest further damage be done them.

The proclamation of Don Henry takes up the story where the preceding
ballad left it off. In the translation of this, it seems to me, Lockhart
has been much more successful than his great father-in-law proved
himself in that of its companion ballad. I do not think it possible,
however, to render adequately by an English pen the dignified rhythm of
the Castilian in which this *romancero* is dressed. But the second
verse,

<tr class="odd">

is really fine, expressive, and ascends a whole scale of terrible
thought and realization. Are these awful eyes dead? Can the threat they
hold be imaginary? My hands are wet with brother's blood, but it is only
by virtue of a slender chance that his are not imbrued with mine. The
verse is horribly eloquent of the death. cold atmosphere of the moment
which follows murder—-simple, appalling, desperately tragic. The mad
grief of the slain King's paramour is drawn with a touch almost as
successful.

The Moor Reduan

We may pass by "The Lord of Butrayo" and "The King of Arragon "and come
to the ballad of" The Moor Reduan," a piece based on the siege of
Granada, last stronghold of the Moors, and the first of those in which
Lockhart deals with the romanceros fronterizos, or romances of the
frontier, which, as we have before remarked, may have been influenced by
Moorish ideas, or may even represent borrowings or données of a kind
more or less direct. In his critique of this romancero Mr. Fitzmaurice
Kelly says: " Lockhart is, of course, not to blame for translating the
ballad precisely as he found it in the text before him. Any translator
would be bound to do the same to-day if he attempted a new rendering of
the poem; but he would doubtless think it advisable to state in a note
the result of the critical analysis which had scarcely been begun when
Lockhart wrote. It now seems fairly certain that Pérez de Hita ran two
romanceros into one, and that the verses from the fourth stanza onward
in Lockhart,

| They passed the Elvira gate with banners all displayed, |

are part of a ballad on Boabdil's expedition against Lucena in 1483."
This is only partially correct. Lockhart knew perfectly well that the
piece was not homogeneous. Indeed he says, "The following is a version
of certain parts of two ballads," although he seems to have been unaware
that one of them was that dealing with Boabdil's expedition. That
portion,

Reduan had registered a rash vow to take the city of Jaen so that he
might win the daughter of the Moorish king. The ninth verse is full of a
grateful music, not too often found in the poetry of the Britain of
1823:

</tr>
</tbody>

although, I confess, the internal rhyming of "paying" and "Jaen"
detracts from the melody of the whole. And this is the besetting sin of
Lockhart, that he mars his happiest efforts by crudities which he
evidently confounded with the simplicity of the ballad form. In all
British balladry, if memory serves me, there is no such vulgarism as
this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_51"></span>[237:2](lrs11.htm#fr_51.md) If Scott wrote this
verse himself (as Lockhart admits), he wrote others.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[240:3](lrs11.htm#fr_52.md) take these two
quatrains from two different versions.
