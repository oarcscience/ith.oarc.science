                        THE LEGEND OF THE MAIDEN

                           The Mysts of Annwfn
                             Book of Shadows


         In Ages long past, the lovely Lady Brighid came to Hibernia
    to dwell in that land among her people.  She brought to them many
    special treasures from the Outer Realms to enrich their lives.
    She gave them the art of Smithcraft, Poetry, and Inspiration.
    Brighid also shared a sacred Cauldron that overflowed with
    inspiration and love.  She was adept at the healing arts, and in
    the Magick of Medicine.  Her people loved her deeply, and kindled
    a fire in her honor which was constantly attended by nineteen
    maidens, and was never allowed to go out.

         The Lady Brighid eventually became a mother, and her people
    rejoiced, knowing their lands would be fruitful just as their
    Goddess was fertile.  However, Brighid also knew the misery of
    loss.  When one of her beloved sons was killed, the whole land
    wept.  She lamented so deeply that she invented "keening," the
    mournful song of the bereaved women of Erin.  Her Flame burned so
    brightly, however, that happiness soon returned to the land.  She
    bestowed upon her people, yet, another gift:  The Art of
    Whistling.

         However, in the fullness of time, the beloved Lady could no
    longer dwell openly with her people, and she made her home in the
    Sidhe.  There, she would dwell close to her people and her land,
    and they could call upon her name at the appointed times, and
    keep her Flame burning within their hearts.


                  The Eternal Flame continues to burn!
