                                ALOHA, Serge King -- a full moon blessing 
                    
                  The only Temple of Peace worth building 
                  Is in your heart, Serge 
                  Is in the human heart 
                  In your students hearts 
                    
                  Peace can not be won with money, Serge 
                  Peace can not be bought 
                  Nor can peace be sold 
                  But peace must be earned 
                    
                  In loving, selfless service to us all 
                  Giving, regiving 
                  Just for the Joy of It 
                  THAT is Aloha 
                    
                  Aloha is never prosperity, Serge 
                  Bought with the money 
                  Tinkling in your pocket 
                  Aloha is free 
                    
                  Giving, regiving in poverty 
                  Sings an ancient song 
                  Full of Joy, Bliss and Love 
                  The true coin of Peace 
                    
                  A so is giving, regiving in wealth 
                  A thing of beauty 
                  Filled with ancient glory 
                  Unsurpassable 
                    
                  With blessings and thanks, I give you this gift 
                  May it touch your heart 
                  And open your heart 
                  May it touch all hearts 
                     
                  ALOHA, Serge King!
