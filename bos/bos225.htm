                                             LEARNING 

                                       (K) 1987 by Jehana.  
                            Disseminate freely if copied in entirity


                    The learning process can be examined as a three-tiered model
          (remembering 
          that, as always,  the map is  almost always not  the territory).   The
          three tiers 
          I shall examine are:

               * Absorption

               * Integration

               * Expression

                    Forany reasonableapproximation offull andcomplete learningto
          have occurred, all three  stages are necessary.  One  might argue that
          there are different  types of learning, and  that each of  these types
          have  their   own  requirements;  or  that  science  must  be  learned
          differently  than  philosophy,  but  I  think  there  are  fundamental
          similarities  governing the  learning of  all types  of things  -- the
          emphasis  and mechanisms  may  change, but  the underlying  principles
          apparently remain.  

                    Absorption isthe actof takingthe externaland bringingit into
          the  internal.  Absorption may involve the cramming of information for
          final exams; it may involve the day-to-day experiences of life; it may
          involve  the shattering  emotional impact  of traumas.   However, this
          emotional impact  is not  reacted to  at this  stage  of the  learning
          process.  Absorption is  the coming aware of information,  whether for
          short  or long  term,  from the  whole  body of  constant  information
          bombarding the  physical  senses  at  all times.    Not  all  that  is
          witnessed or studied becomes absorbed -- the human mind needs a 
          filtering agent.  

                    Integrationis aninternal process,where theknowledge recently
          gained is integrated with  what is already in the mind.   No mind ever
          starts out  as a vacuum, despite the  efforts of generic television to
          assume this.   Not all that  is absorbed is  integrated -- that  which
          falls into short-term memory is not;  nor is material that is  studied
          simply to  know for the knowing's sake.  A deep and thourough internal
          integration  of  material is  not necessary  in  all fields  of study,
          although to some extent this takes place in all devotees of a subject,
          whether it  be  mathematics, engineering,  art, or  philosophy.   This
          integration  leaves its  touches  upon  the  person, and  will  affect
          his/her filtering for material  to absorb in the  future.  Be  advised
          that  some  integration  is  voluntary;  while  other  integration  is
          involuntary.  The actual  process of integration bears no  relation to
          what Other People Are  Doing (although one may integrate  a dependency
          upon others, for instance.)   A conscious awareness of  integration is
          fostered in the study of certain  religious paths (such as the  Craft)
          and in many of the philosophies, as well as in many of the arts.   The
          necessity for the stage of integration is  one reason why the learning
          of anything  of internal value  generally takes time  -- there  are no
          Instant Philosophies which work.  

                                                                             963               

                    Expression is  essential for  communication.   It is  a step
          shallowly  expressed   in  the  regurgitation  of   information  on  a
          quickly-studied  exam,  but  when  dealing  with  philosopy,  art,  or
          livelihood, it  should be of more  durable quality --  in other words,
          expression  should   be  tempered  with  the   fires  of  Integration.
          Expression  may be involuntary (the fright reaction from a phobia), or
          it may be voluntary -- but the most fervent Expression is rooted 
          within the  internal regions of the being, and is not the shallow sort
          of expression  related to acting  the way other  people expect you  to
          act;  for simply the purpose  of scratching that  itch of satisfaction
          (gaining or giving satisfaction).  The most useful forms of Expression
          occur  in  taking that  information which  one  has both  Absorbed and
          Integrated,  and then Expressing it.   However, needless  to say, some
          forms of Expression (ie, phobias) may be well-integrated and absorbed,
          but are counterproductive  to happiness.   The true conscious  learner
          must therefore take  a hand  in what he/she  decides to  learn/unlearn
          (the steps involved in the process of Unlearning are the same as those
          in the process of Learning.)  

                    *Absorption and Expressionwithout Integration ismindless and
          empty reading/living.   One may as  well be a parrot.   Absorption and
          Integration without Expression is hypocritical and/or schitzophrenic.

                    *Integration  and Expression  without Absorption  permits no
          external influences to have any bearing  on thought -- one may as well
          be autistic.  

                    *Expression without Absorptionencourages fallacies,untruths,
          and easy answers.  

               All portions of the Absorption, Integration, and Expression cycle
          are necessary  for true learning  to take  place.  While  much of  the
          current  school system  as set  up in  today's society  emphasizes the
          Absorption and the Expression  stages, leaving the Integration process
          to  be assumed,  children  still do  grow up  learning to  emulate and
          integrate the values that  impinge upon them.   (Not all these  values
          are necessarily  beneficial --  the learning  process does  not always
          rely  on those values externally professed, but  does pick up on those
          implied on a  deeper level.)  Therefore, say, a  geography lesson need
          not be Integrated within the student, as a study of values or personal
          transformation should most definitely be.  A student has, through life
          experiences, already  Integrated a  system of functioning;  of viewing
          the world.  (Indeed, the student  may have Integrated a varying set of
          systems -- this often leads to internal conflicts, which really should
          be resolved.  Within  certain alternative Philosophies, Integration of
          other  ways of  viewing the world  and the  person is  done in  a more
          purposeful manner.  The  student learns that  true learning is not  in
          rote memorization  but in the acceptance  and the working  with of all
          three stages of learning.   Also, the student  learns to realize  that
          Integration  is a  personal  stage, wherein  the information  absorbed
          interacts  with  that he/she  has  already Integrated  during  life --
          therefore this Integration may definitely not resemble the Integration
          process of another student  in the same class.   Nor should Expression
          be forced (at least when dealing with the momentous events of a 
          life-philosophy -- it should come from the heart -- in other words, it
          should  come from the Expression of the Absorption and the Integration
          the  student has  undergone, rather  than from  what someone  else has
          decreed to be Proper).  

                                                                             964
