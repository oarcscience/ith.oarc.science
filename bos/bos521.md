                             *              
                                            
                      SHE MOVED THRU THE FAIRE
                                  -Padraic Colum
                      recorded by Theodore Bikel
                                            
       My young love said to me: My mother won't mind
       And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind
       She put her arms 'round me; these words she did say:
       It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day!
                                            
       Then she stepped away from me, and she moved thru the Faire
       And so fondly I watched her move here and move there
       At last she turned homeward, with one star awake
       As the Swan in the evening moves over the lake.
                                            
       Last night she came to me, my dead love came in
       And so soft did she move that her feet made no din
       She put her arms 'round me; these words she did say:
       It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day!
                                            
                              *             
                                                                                2312
