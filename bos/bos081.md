              "Morals are the nagging fear that somebody somewhere may be 
              having a good time." --H. L. Mencken 
               
                   What is the difference between one of us and Oral Roberts?  
              Well, hopefully there are lots of differences, but the top one 
              on my list is that I work on being ethical and he is a moralist. 
               
                   The moralist knows how everybody else should behave in order 
              to be a good person, avoid Hell, fit into decent society, etc., 
              etc.  He is quite likely to feel that he is a valid exception to 
              all his own rules, since he can handle temptation and control his 
              outcomes.  His main characteristic is frantic paranoid distrust 
              of other people.  No one should be seen nude, for instance, 
              because this would be un-bearably sexually arousing and lead to 
              promiscuity, neglect of ordinary duties, etc.  He knows he can 
              control himself, but everybody else has to be "protected" from 
              their evil impulses.  His major defence is projection: "I'm not 
              oversexed, and of course I'd never want to be or want to be 
              unfaithful to my wife, but that woman in the (name situation or 
              article of clothing) sure is asking for it.  Ultimate expressions 
              of this type of thinking are wife-beating -- one man said, "When 
              I walked into the self-help group I thought that when they heard 
              what I'd had to put up with they'd con-gratulate me for not 
              having killed her." -- and witch-burning -- "I am a good person.  
              Bad things do not happen to good people.  A bad thing has 
              happened to me.  Somebody did it!  Kill them!" 
               
                   In essence, the moralist is saying "It can't be my fault 
              (I'm not able to face the idea that it might be my fault).  It 
              must be somebody else's fault.  If people would just follow these 
              few simple rules, which I'll be glad to explain to them, nothing 
              would go wrong and I wouldn't have to feel anxious.  But since 
              they won't all follow my rules, everything is their fault, not 
              mine, and I don't have to feel anxious."

                   To me this is nauseating.  I have no idea how you "should" 
              behave; who are you?  What's the situation?  Who else is 
              affected?  Even then, the best I could offer would be some 
              suggestions of courses of action which might have good results -- 
               but I don't believe there are any simple rules for human conduct 
              which are always "right."  What I do believe is that ethical 
              behavior consists of choosing your actions such that you can look 
              at yourself in the mirror in the morning without flinching.  
              Which means I can see a Corsican being ethical and killing 
              another person as part of a feud; a gypsy being ethical and 
              defrauding a gaujo.  I suspect that what I mean here is that 
              ethics impel you to be true to your own values, while morals make 
              you want to 
              a) control others, and 
              b) not get caught yourself.  But being ethical implies that they 
              are your own values, which you have thought through and decided 
              to accept, and not just the ones you have swallowed whole from 
              your family or culture. 
               
                   Marjoe, a famous evangelist who later went straight, 
              described preaching hellfire and damnation and then going back to 
              the motel and making love to his girlfriend of the moment -- who 
              had to be flown in from New York so the locals wouldn't know what 
              he was doing.  Oral Roberts says people have to give him $8 
              million, or God will "call him home."  These are examples of 
              people whose highest priority is influencing others, making the 
              right kind of impression - the actuality doesn't seem to be 
              really relevant to their choice-making process. 
               
                   The ethical person, on the other hand, may not care at all 
              about the impression he is erig; he will say in total sincerity 
              "I know I look like a fool for doing it, but I couldn't have 
              lived with myself if I hadn't."  Or even harder, "I know you 
              think I'm being hard and cruel, but I honestly believe this is 
              the best solution in the circumstances." 
               
                   Next issue (are you holding your breath?) the difference be- 
              tween act idealism and absolute idealism, or how to tell a witch 
              from a fundamentalist without a score card.
