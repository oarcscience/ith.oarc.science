                                             IDEOLOGY 
                                      0
                 The human mind seeks to create order out of Chaos

              It  is in the nature of humanity to attempt to formulate laws from ex-
              perience  as a guide to  future action. Acting  as a feedback-response
              mechanism, the  mind considers the  results of previous  behaviour and
              creates laws of action in  an attempt to repeat past good  results and
              avoid  bad results. In the individual this is known as personality, in
              the communal world it is known as science.

                                      1
                         All scientific laws are false

              Science attempts to map the  universe as a result of  previous collec-
              tive  experience.  Since this  is limited  to  what has  actually been
              experienced so  far, it is always inadequate, and since it is not what
              has been experienced it  is always human-centred. It cannot  be objec-
              tive  because the object does not experience, only the subject, human-
              ity, experiences. Two approaches  have been used to tackle  this prob-
              lem.  The philosophy  of the  western world  posits that  an external,
              objective world interacts with  us through scientific experiment, thus
              science  creates  objectively  true  laws.  Other European  philosophy
              holds, correctly  in my view,  that talk  of an  objective reality  is
              beyond experience and is thus meaningless babble. Moreover, scientific
              experiment is no more objective than a childs attempt to walk. To Know
              is  not a high ideal, it is an  instinct born of our particular way of
              survival, and is thus survival-centred. Science is our Elephant Trunk,
              our Giraffe  Neck,  and since  it is  inherently inadequate,  it is  a
              belief system, a set of interconnected ideas-about-things. In terms of
              European, Post-Hegelian philosophy, it is an ideology.

                                      2
                 All idealogies are subject to chaotic dissolution

              Every idealogy,  whether science,  Christianity or whatever,  seeks to
              and succeeds in creating a coherent view of reality that satisfies its
              believers. The problem is  that there is inevitably a gulf between the
              idealogy and reality. Ideologies are fixed; reality is fluid. Thus all
              ideologies are subject to readjustment when a new discovery challenges
              the  existing  view. The  rediscovery  of the  Greek  text of  the New
              Testament and the  discovery of  the non-existence of  the Ether  each
              corroded the existing ideologies of their day.

              The Christian  world responded with Reformation  and Counter-Reformat-
              ion. (Historical note: Counter-Reformation  was the Reformation of the
              Catholic Church rather than an attack on  the Protestant Reformation.)
              Science responded with Einsteinian  relativity. These new elements are
              Chaotic. The extent to  which the ideology can  reform depends on  how
              deep the Chaotic  element bites into the  ideological structure. Every
              ideology  has central tenets  upon which the rest  depend: so the dis-
              covery that Jesus was  actually stoned to death rather  than crucified
              would cause major rumblings;  the discovery that he was  a woman would
              cause  deeper  rumblings; but  the discovery  that  he was  a spaceman
              carrying out a  standard sociological experiment would  bring down the
              ideology entire.  Several ideologies have completely  collapsed in the
              past,  such as Ptolomaic astronomy, and it can happen again. Moreover,
              the spread of a unified ideology over the whole globe, Western  Democ-
              racy, leaves the way open to a bigger collapse than ever before.


                                                                                1253

                                      3
                   There is no such thing as innate value

              All present Western ideologies depend upon a concept of innate
              worth, whereby certain things are automatically "better" than
              others. The White Race, Men, Adults, all have had their "innate"
              value knocked for six. Even the Animal Kingdom is no longer seen as
              of higher worth than the Vegetable as the spread of the Gaia
              hypothesis shows. This is the Chaotic element that can bring down a
              whole pack of cards. There is no ethical reference point, no
              beginning from which to derive an end to aim for, to praise, to work
              towards. As it says in Liber Al: "let there be no difference made
              between one thing and another". The result is a confusion of belief
              as people scramble to find a new ideology. Fundamentalists choose
              deliberate blindness and perverse stupidity. Thelemites choose "pure
              will, unassuaged of purpose". Chaoists worship the confusion itself
              as the only "true thing" left. Pagans begin to construct a new
              ideology based on the absence of heirarchy and turn to cyclical and
              egalitarian beliefs. That a new ideology, or many, will arise is
              inevitable; even the truth of Chaos is only true to us, in our
              experience. But so what. All things considered, I think that things
              are going pretty well.
