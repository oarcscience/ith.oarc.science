                         NUDE               
                          -W.J.Bethancourt III
                          -Ed Hirt          
      copyright 1982 W.J.Bethancourt III and Ed Hirt
                  (Tune: "Men of Harlech")
                                            
    What the use of wearing panties         
    Whalebone corsets of your Auntie's      
    Boxer shorts and other scanties         
    Best of all is nude                     
    There's such fun in going bra-less      
    Now that it's no longer lawless         
    'Specially if your figure's flawless    
    Best of all is nude                     
    Nude is what you're born in             
    Shirts are never torn in                
    Underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
    Yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
    Ducks all do it, maidens rue it         
    Even ancient Picts in Britain blue it   
    Going naked's how to do it              
    Best of all is nude!                    
                                            
    If your garters aren't elastic          
    Tie them up in knots fantastic          
    (Panty hose is something drastic!)      
    Best of all is nude!                    
    If you're tired of wearing clotheses    
    Shed your garment 'mongst the roses     
    Never mind the old bluenoses            
    Best of all is nude!                    
    Nude is best for ducking!               
    Worst for horses bucking!               
    Moonlit nights will see such sights     
        that are very best for fooling round
                            .....and elbows!
    Nudity is grand to see                  
    A well-known antidote to virginity      
    Take your clothes off and you'll see:   
    Best of all is nude!

                                                                                2303
