                                                SNOW 
                  
                 Goddess is beautiful dressed in white 
                 The tiny white crystals that fall through the night 
                 They fall so gentle, don't make a sound 
                 As they drift to Earth and lay on the ground 
                   
                 Looking up, snow melts on my face 
                 as I leave behind the hectic pace 
                 I'm in another world, one of love 
                 communing with the Goddess above 
                   
                 Drawing the power from all around me 
                 one with Her, I truely wish to be 
                 This is the quest for which I strive 
                 It is my reason for being alive 
                   
                 Standing alone, staring at the sky 
                 I feel a tear coming to my eye 
                 The feeling of peace is awesome you see 
                 I feel the Goddess surrounding me
