                              CONCERNING THE HEYOKAH
                            Copyright 1987, T. W. Moore

              Hello, people!  Before I get to the subject of this little
         piece, let me give you a bit of information as to its roots.

              Recently I have been doing a lot of writing, horror stories
         for the most part, and this article grew out of that.  It is also
         derived from a dream that I had not too long ago and something
         that has puzzled me until recently.  Now, with all that out of
         the way, let's get to it.

              Those of you who are familiar with Native American beliefs
         already have an idea of what a heyokah is.  For the benefit of
         those who aren't, I'll try to briefly describe him for you.  Who
         knows?  There may well be a counterpart in your own tradition.

              The word heyokah comes from the Lakotah (Sioux) and is used
         in reference to a particular type of shaman.  According to
         tradition, the heyokah is one who has "dreamed of the Thunder
         Spirits."  This dream bestows great powers upon the medicine
         man/medicine woman, one of which is reputed to be an ability to
         influence storms.  However, these powers have their price in that
         the shaman becomes a "contrary/"  If you've seen the movie Little
         Big Man, then you have seen a sample of the heyokah's antics.  Of
         course, this was a parody of the real thing, but our subject does
         do a lot of clowning around in reverse.

              Now I've read quite a bit on the subject (there's a lot out
         there, too), but still couldn't put it together.  There seemed to
         be something missing!  It's only in the last month or so that
         it's become clear to me and I'd like to share my insights with
         you.

                                                                             633

              Probably the greatest barrier to my understanding was the
         one created by language.  Not being able to speak Lakotah, and
         additionally not knowing the culture, I lost something in the
         translation.  Here's the whole picture, as I see it anyway.

              In his vision, the heyokah comes into direct contact with
         the life-force itself.  This is symbolized by the Thunder Spirits
         that he dreams of.  When this occurs, a death/rebirth sequence is
         begun, which gives the shaman the capacity to control some of the
         manifestations of life-force.  This would include an ability to
         influence storms and, as is typical of the shamanic experience,
         the power to heal.  He also becomes a very potent teacher.  This
         last is where the "contrariness" comes into focus, in two ways. 
         The first is that the heyokah is teaching us about our selves. 
         By "mirroring" all of our doubts, fears, hatreds, weaknesses,
         etc. he forces us to examine what we really are.  For example, if
         you have any self-hatred (a common malady in our society) this
         sacred teacher will make you look at it.  The second aspect of
         his mirroring is that, as we are taught, the heyokah heals us of
         our hurts.  This is the most important and remarkable part of the
         holy man's clowning.  For this wonderful shaman takes our pain
         and transforms it into laughter.  And what can heal a human
         beings faster than to laugh at ourselves?

              As you can see, these "sacred clowns" had a very important
         role in traditional societies.  And personally, I think we could
         use a few more of them in today's world.
