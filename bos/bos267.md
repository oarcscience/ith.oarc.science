              From: L.A. HUSSEY
              To: J_RANDOM FOLKSINGER
              Subj: THE LAWS
              I  am disturbed and disappointed.   "The Christians  are our enemies."
              "They  will torture you to make you talk about the Craft."  "Lie about
              the Craft." "Covens splitting up makes for bad feelings."

              What  depressing  garbage.   This  is the  20th  century, and  this is
              America,  this is not Inquisition days.   The more we keep secret, the
              more the ignorant will assume that  we have horrible secrets to  keep.
              The true secrets of the Gods cannot be given away, because they cannot
              be  spoken -- they are beyond  all language.  And  as for bad feelings
              when  covens break  up, maybe  that is  how it is  where you  are, but
              around here,  there is rejoicing when one coven becomes two.  Seems to
              me like  my best  possible response  to your "Laws"  is the  following
              song:

              BURNING TIMES
              The songs are sung to rouse our  anger of martyred Witches gone to the
              fires,
              But what is served by  righteous singing, if all we do is  stew in our
              ire?
              Nine million dead in four hundred years;
              More in that time simply died of disease.
              Why do we dwell on long past dead
              When we are alive in times like these?
              (cho)
              Rise up, Witches, throw off your masks
              And cease crying guilt for ancient crimes.
              Earth and all Her children need us
              For ALL face now the Burning Times.

              In  the face  of that hostile  power, how  did the  old knowledge stay
              alive?
              How have we  still a  Craft to practise?   Our ancestors  knew how  to
              fight and survive!
              How do we honour our blessed dead?
              Slavery threatens us all but few.
              We must teach their cunning ways --
              EVERYONE needs the skills they knew!
              (cho2)
              Rise up, Witches, gather your strength,
              And let your power spread and climb;
              Earth and all Her children need us
              For ALL face now the Burning Times.

              I will not  cast off Science's works -- Witches all forces to Will can
              bend;
              I'll not accuse for war and waste some patriarchy of faceless men.
              Men do not cast the only votes;
              Women alone do not demonstrate.
              Rather than shut out half the race,
              Who if not we will change that state?
              (cho2)


                                                                                1215

              I will not blame a Father's Church -- blame and guilt are their tools,
              not mine,
              And  even in  the shuls and  churches, allies  there will  I seek, and
              find!
              I will not answer hate with fear,
              Nor with a smug, cheek-turning love.
              I will not answer hate with rage;
              By strength alone will I not be moved!
              (cho2)

              I will not  hide in my sacred  grove -- the  fact'ries and cities  yet
              ring me about;
              I  will not climb my ivory tower --  the real world exists tho' I shut
              it out.
              I will not work for Church nor State
              Who serve themselves while they serve us lies,
              Nor only for my Witchen kin,
              But for the family of all alive!
              (cho2)

              So if rebellion means to fight a State lost sight of why it was built,
              If heresy's to reject a Church that rules with force or fear or guilt,
              Then let us all be rebels proud,
              And shameless heretics by creed --
              A tyrant's hand subjects the Earth,
              More heretic rebels are what She needs!
              (cho2)

              Did  it ever occur to the writers  of your antique laws that the Craft
              might actually  be WELCOMED by a  great number of people?   That there
              might actually be more of us than of those who wish us ill?   That the
              only reason those who fear  us are so active nowadays is  because they
              see us becoming  more and more welcomed  by more people?  As  I say in
              another song, "When folk in sorrow  turn away/ From paths that lead to
              misery/ And seek  new ways  for wholeness' sake/  Then waiting,  ready
              shall we be."

              All I can say is, I'm Goddess-glad I'm not in your tradition.

              B*B
              Leigh Ann

              To  this I  would add  only  one more  admonishment, based  on my  own
              experience: It is  as important not to take oneself,  one's power, and
              one's  Craft too  seriously as  it is  not to  take them  too lightly.
              Moderation in all things, including moderation.  And remember that all
              acts of love and pleasure are the rites of
              the Goddess, and this includes HAVING FUN.

              B*B Leigh Ann


                                                                                1216
