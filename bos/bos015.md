# Invocations to Frigg, Baldur, Freyja, Freyr, Brigit, Herne and Thorr

#### Russ Anderson

*When the invocation to Frigg was first used, each person in a healing
circle invoked a healer into hirself. This was my invocation. The rest
of the circle was asked to echo "Join us, Frigg" as I was saying "Join
us, Frigg". This was my first attempt at writing an invocation, and it
DID work. I hope that it also works for anyone else who wishes to use
it, because it now feels like time to share it.  
Blessed Be, Russ.*
