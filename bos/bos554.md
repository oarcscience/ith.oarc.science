                                    The Pit 
            The Lord looked askance at the Fool, who was busy making faces
    behind the Lady's back.
            "So, which of your Aspects have you enjoyed the most?" he said.
            The Fool looked up, wiggling his ears.
            "Stop that!" grinned the Lord, "I'd really like to know!"
            "Well.....I suppose that it would be a toss-up between Dionysus,
    Tyl Eulenspiegel, and Krishna, I guess. Tyl had a whopping good time,
    Dionysus got to be pretty much drunk, mostly, and Krishna had those
    sweet little milk-maids......THAT was a good time! But Coyote gets to do
    most everything. I guess I like Him the best."
            The Lord sat back against a tree, folded His hands, and smiled.
            "Yeah, ol' Coyote gets to do everything all right...except catch
    the Roadrunner," he said.
            "Well," said the Fool, with a lopsided grin, "I guess I'm the
    only One of Us that perpetually chases Myself!"
            The Lady turned, and, Aspecting the Nymph, dropped a large
    grasshopper down the Fool's back. She giggled, and ran off over the
    fields of Summerland.
            The Lord laughed, pounding His fists on the ground as the Fool
    jumped and twisted, trying to reach the insect.
            Between whoops of laughter, He said, "Did you ever figure out
    what 'Updoc' was?"
            "Shaddup!" said the Fool.

        ---------------------------------------------------------------

            The Fool leaned back against the brick wall of the alley and
    said, "I'd like to tell you a story. It seems that a man fell into a
    deep pit, and couldn't get himself out. He was in a world of hurt, and
    pretty unhappy. Pretty soon, a Subjectivist type of person came along
    and said, 'I feel for you down there,' but did nothing."
            "An Objectivist wandered by next, and said, 'It's logical that
    someone would fall down there.' But he just stood around looking too."
            "A Pharisee said, 'Only bad people fall into a pit,' and put his
    nose in the air and kept walking."
            The Fool took a drag from his cigarette and then flipped it
    expertly into a nearby puddle. Somewhere in the distance of the city a
    siren wailed.
            "Then, a mathematician calculated how he fell into the pit. But
    all he did was calculate."
            "A news reporter wanted the exclusive story on his pit, but was
    too busy interviewing everyone in sight to help."
            "A fanatic fundamentalist shouted, 'You deserve your pit!'"
            "Then a government tax-man asked if he was paying taxes on the
    pit."
            "A self-pitying person then whined, 'You haven't seen anything
    until you've seen MY pit!'"
            "Then a Christian Scientist came by, and said, 'Just believe
    that you're not in a pit.' But that didn't seem to help." He paused, and
    brushed His hair back from His eyes. After looking around that those who
    were listening, He continued.
            "An optimist said, 'Things could be worse!' But the pessimist
    disagreed, and said, 'Things -will- get worse!' "
            "A Wiccan said, 'MURPHY! You &*$%^#@,' while a New Ager jumped
    into the pit to share the experience." A couple of people laughed at
    this, a bit nervously.
            "A Baha'i looked over the edge of the pit and said, 'See the pit
    2441

    as a Spiritual Experience!' while a Moslem murmured that it was God's
    Will that he was in the pit."
            "A Satanist just laughed at the man in the pit and kept
    walking."
            "A conspiracist rubbed his hands together in glee, and said,
    '-They- threw you into the pit! I -knew- it!'"
            "A Jew said, 'Why are we -always- in a pit?' "
            "A Communist shouted 'Why are you in the People's Pit without
    permission?'"
            "An Alcoholic muttered to himself, 'It's not -my- fault you're
    in the pit.....' "
           "A Liberal said, 'Those Conservatives must have dug this pit!'"
           "A Conservative said, 'See where Liberalism has gotten you?' "
           "A TV Evangelist came by and promptly took up a collection from
    the bystanders."
           " Then, several well-meaning people came by, and wanted to help,
    but they were too busy arguing whether to throw him a ladder, or a
    shovel, or to hire a helicopter with a rope ladder, or to call the fire
    department or police to manage to get anything done."
           "A well-known radio cult hunter said, between requests for money,
    'See! Satan threw you into the pit!'"
           "A doper looked blearily at him, and said, a bit incoherently,
    'Far out! Got any more pit?'"
           "A Hindu said that the man's karma had put him into the pit, and
    a television news commentator shouted, 'Man in a pit! Why is the
    government responsible?'"
            But then, a Good Samaritan came along, looked at the man in the
    pit and at all the others standing around pursuing their own agendas,
    and  said, quietly, 'Here are two shovels. Let's get you out of the
    pit.'"
            The Fool looked around at His listeners, grinned, and said, "He
    that hath ears to hear with, let him hear."
            He shoved His hands into his jacket, and walked away thru the
    puddles, idly kicking at an empty beer can.

            "Pretty good!" said the Lady.
            "Maybe," said the Fool, "But not up to the Sermon On The Mount."
            "That one -was- one of Your best," She agreed.
            "Yeah," He said, "But even then, they ignored most of it. Oh
    well.  Some of it caught on, at least."
            "It takes a while," said the Lord, "But they -are- learning."
            "Yes, they are," said the Fool, "But they have a long way to go
    yet."
            The Lady smiled warmly, and said, "They'll get there."

            Thus it was, and so it is, and evermore shall be so!
