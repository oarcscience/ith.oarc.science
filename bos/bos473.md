                           THE TRIPLE GODDESS 

              As the Maiden, I saw through your eyes as a child
              Spring rains, green forests, and animals wild!
              I saw you run freely on the Earth with bare feet!
              I watched as you danced in the winds, blowing free!
              I was there as you grew, getting stronger each day!
              I brought you rainbows, chasing grey skies away!
              I was there in your laughter - I was there in your tears!
              I was the acceptance you gained from your peers!
              I saw your first love and I felt your first blush,
              As passion first stirred in the night's gentle hush!
              I am there with you always in the fresh morning dew!
              I bring you the crispness of beginnings anew.

              As the Mother, I bore all the labor distress
              Of birthing your child, and I felt the caress
              Of your hand on the face of the new life so dear.
              I heard its first cry, and I eased your fear!
              I provided the milk which you fed from your breast
              Till the baby grew strong, and with health it was blessed.
              As she took her first step, I was there in your smile!
              I was there while you nurtured your beautiful child!
              On the first day of school, when the doors opened wide
              I was there in your fear - I was there in your pride.
              I am there with you always in the bright full of moon!
              I bring you fertility - abundance in bloom.

              As the Crone, I brought blessings of wisdom with age
              [Wisdom not found by the turn of a page].
              I was there as you taught the correct way to live:
              To love and to trust - to take and to give!
              I was there in the twinkle of your aged eye!
              I was there in your thoughts of the years flying by!
              I was there when you taught the Mysteries of old!
              I was there in the fire warming you in the cold!
              In the weariness of age, I was there with you, too...
              I brought well-deserved rest and peace unto you!
              I am there with you always in the darkness of night!
              I complete your life cycle, guiding you toward the light.

              Maid, Mother and Crone - We are all One -
              Yet We are all separate, as each role is done.
              We do not leave you - We're always there
              As you walk through this life with your worries and cares;
              As you dance in the spiral, We live inside -
              Deep in your spirit - where nothing can hide!
              No matter your path, no matter it's length -
              We give you courage and We give you strength.
              We are there to support you every hour of day
              And deep in the night, when dreams take you away.
              Our gifts We give freely, for you are our Child...
              Yes, We are the Lady:  Wise, Pure, and Mild!
              -Kalioppe-


                                                                                2211
