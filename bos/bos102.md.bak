              The Care and Feeding of Crystals 
              by Matrika 
              co-sysop of PAN - the Psychic Awareness Network 
               
              Crystals  have been in the  lime-light ever since  celebrities such as
              Shirley Mcleane and Cher have come out of the closet and admitted they
              were  "New-Agers".  However, along with this public scrutiny, has also
              been  a whole bunch  of misconceptions.   The most common  of which is
              that a person just wears  a crystal like jewelry or carries  it and it
              works  like  some kind  of  instant  stage-magic or  prestidigitation.
              This, of course,  is not the case.  To get the full effect of "Crystal
              Power" in  your life means,  as with so  much else, that you  must put
              into it what you take out of it.  So here are a few  simple guidelines
              for those of you who plan on taking this subject seriously. 
               
              1.  Selecting your Crystal 
              To select  a Crystal is not  all that much different  from selecting a
              pet or a  work of art.   When you go into  the store to purchase  your
              crystal - or  any other stone used  in healing or Psychic  work - just
              pick the one that "calls" to you.  Handle the various stones and place
              them, one by one, in  your receptive hand.  (the one that  is not your
              dominant  hand;  if  you   are  right-handed  or  ambi-dextrous,  your
              receptive hand is your  left.  If you are completely  left-handed your
              receptive hand  is your right.)  The stone  that is right FOR YOU will
              "pull" you to it.  This may  not be the stone that looks the  clearest
              or the most impressive, either.  Our societies materialistic values 
              and our conditioning to  accept them must not enter into our decision,
              which is very hard for most of us at first.  Our first tendency  is to
              judge the stone -as we always judge ourselves and everything else in a
              constant  stream  of thoughts-  by what  we  have been  conditioned to
              believe is "good" or "bad". 
                
              If  the piece  you are choosing  is for  a specific  purpose; i.e. for
              healing, or to enhance  your psychic abilities, or for  meditation; it
              will help if you keep that purpose in mind while you are selecting the
              stone.  An interesting phenomena often happens to people who are  just
              going into the  gem and mineral healing or psychic  work.  Most people
              start off with  clear quartz,  because it has  the most  applications.
              They go into a store or a gem show to purchase a clear quartz and find
              themselves drawn to all kinds of other "rocks" (as the collectors call
              them) too.  Many times  they bring a bag of various  mineral specimens
              home with them.  Later they look up the stones in one of the many
              reference books  on this  subject, only to  find the stones  they were
              drawn to  are  exactly the  ones  they need  to  deal with  issues  or
              illnesses that they need to work on. 
               
              The very first thing you need to do when you first get a crystal is to
              "clear it" from the imbalanced energies of anyone else who has touched
              it.     Crystals  "work"  because  of   their  piezoelectrical  field.
              Researchers in Kirlian photography and  other subjects have long shown
              us  that the  body  is  surrounded  by  a  field  of  electro-magnetic
              energies, which psychics call the AURA.  People who have  studied this
              subject  tell   us   that  Crystals   help   us  by   attuning   their
              piezoelectrical  charge to the charge of our  auras.  So we must first
              remove the charges  from the stone that come from  other's handling of
              it.   This  is done  by leaving  the stone  in sea-salt  (available at
              almost any health-food store) for 3 days.  The only time you will have
              to use  this technique -  which is drastic -  to cleanse the  stone is

                                                                                 413

              when you  first buy it.  The reason I  say the technique is drastic is
              because it erases ALL of your energy from the stone too, so  the stone
              has  to be rebonded.  (explained later) This piezoelectrical effect of
              the  stone is  the  same  reason  that  quartz  is  useful  in  making
              computers, telephones, watches, and in other electronic devices. 
               
              2.  the regular maintenance of your stone 
               
              The regular care and maintenance of your stone is really quite simple.
              First of all a gentler method of clearing the piece should be used  at
              least once a week and after any uses in either physical or inner 
              (mental/emotional/spiritual)  healing  work.    This can  be  done  in
              several  ways.  First of all, you can  run it under COOL - no extremes
              of temperature PLEASE - water in your sink for several minutes,  while
              visualizing (intensely imagining in vivid detail, from a meditative or
              extremely  relaxed state) all imbalanced energies leaving it.  You can
              also  leave  it  in  mugwort  (an herb)  for  2-3  days  buried  it in
              carefully.   You  can also  place it  in a  flowerpot with  an african
              violet plant, but you should know that if it has been used to heal any
              severe  conditions, the  plant will  die.  The  stones should  also be
              re-charged  about once a month or after  every use.  For other stones,
              direct sunlight is  not such a  good idea as it  can fade the  colors.
              You can  get the reflected  energy of the  sun by placing  them in the
              moonlight during the waxing of  the moon.  (from one day after the new
              moon through the  night of the full moon)  They can also be charged by
              surrounding them in a circle  of quartz points that have  been charged
              by  the sun, with the points of  the crystals facing inward toward the
              stones being  charged.  Another method  is to purchase an  amethyst or
              quartz cluster and place  the stones on it.   A cluster is a  specimen
              with several individual  crystals on it.   Oh, and  if you charge  the
              stone by  a circle  of crystals,  be sure they  have been  cleared and
              charged themselves before  using them  to charge anything  else.   The
              circle  should consist  of at least  4 points,  but 8 is  best.  These
              stones used for charging do NOT have to be large at all. 
               
              3.  Using your stones
              Stones are tools in our psychic work and, as in any other object used,
              work by focusing the mind's powers.  To get the best use out  of them,
              more than just wearing them or carrying them is required.  They should
              be  used from a  state of meditation,  while visualizing  the goals we
              wish  to accomplish  with them  - such  as healing,  increased Psychic
              perception, etc.    A good way to do this for to help you focus  and a
              self-hypnosis tape that relates to your goals and use  it.  And if you
              are using the crystals in healing, be aware that they are NOT meant to
              replace the care of a competent health  professional - but many people
              find them a useful adjunct to it.
