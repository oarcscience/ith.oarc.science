                                       The Gaea Thesis

         IN order the understand the nature of the All-Mother, we must first
         understand our own origins.  Each of began our individual life as a single,
         fertilized cell or zygote.  In the processs of its innumerable divisions
         and multiplications, that cell kept dividing up and redistributing the very
         same protoplasm.  That protoplasm which now courses through all of the
         several trillion cells of your adult body is the very same substance which
         once coursed through the bosy of that original zygote.  For when a cell
         reproduces, the mother cell does not remain intact, but actually becomes
         the two new daughter cells.  ANd this is  why, no matter how many times a
         cell fissions in the process of embryological development, all the daughter
         cells collectively continue to compprise but one single organism.
         We may imagine that, should our cells have consciousness akin to our own,
         they may very well fancy themselves to be independent entities living and
         dying in a world that to them would seem to be merely an inanimate environ-
         ment.  But we know them to be in fact minute components of the far vaster
         living beings that we ourselves are.

         Over four billion years ago, life on Earth bega, as do we all, with a
         single living cell containing a replicating molecule of DNA.  From that
         point on that original cell, the first to develop the awesome capacity for
         reproduction, divided and redividied and subdivided its protoplasm into the
         myriads of plants and animals, including ourselvs, which now inhabit this
         third planet from the Sun.

         But no matter how many times a cell fissions in the process of embryolog-
         ical development, all the daughter cells collectively continue to comprise
         but one single organism.  ALl life on Earth comprises the body of single
         vast living being -- Mother Earth Herself.  The Moon is Her radiant heart,
         and in the tides beat the pulse of Her blood.  That protoplasm which
         coursed through the body of that first primeval ancestral cell is the very
         protoplasm which now courses through every cell of every living organism,
         plant or animal,of our planet. And the soul of our planetary biosphere is
         She whom we call Goddess/

                 "First life on my sources
                 First drifted and swam
                 Out of me are the forces
                 Which save it or damn
                 Out of man and woman
                         and wild-beast and bird
