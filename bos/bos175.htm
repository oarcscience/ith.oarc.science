                +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
                |                 The Triskelion Rite of Tea                  | 
                +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
      
                 Purpose:       The purpose  of this working is to pay homage 
                                to the Gods and to reflect on Their blessings 
                                upon this your life. 
      
                 Tools:         * Herb(s) for tea 
                                * Container for herb(s) 
                                * Cup(s) and Tea Pot 
                                * Decanter of Pure Spring Water 
                                * Brewing dish with candle 
                                * Scrying Candle 
      
                 Prepare By:    Placing a  small table  or  platform  in  the 
                                center of  your working  space and  arranging 
                                the Brewing  dish, herbs, cup(s), Tea Pot and 
                                spoon on  the table.  Also place the cauldron 
                                with scrying candle within for use during the 
                                meditation. (Use  the diagram, which follows, 
                                as a  guide  for  arranging  of  the  tools.) 
                                Prior to casting the Circle, light candle and 
                                fill the  Brewing dish with Spring Water from 
                                a decanter.   Keep  the Brewing  Dish covered 
                                during the  Casting, as  I  have  found  this 
                                helps the water to heat faster and hotter. 
      
                +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
                |                 The Blessing of the Herbs                   | 
                +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
      
                      With the  tip of your Athame touching the Herbs, intone 
                 this blessing: 
      
      
                             Thou has grown by favor of the Sun, 
                                  The Moon, and of the dew. 
                              I make this intercession, ye herb: 
                      I beseech thee to be of benefit to me and my rite, 
                                For thy virtues are unfailing. 
                              Thou art the Dew of all the Gods, 
                                     The Eye of the Sun, 
                                    The Light of the Moon, 
                               The Beauty and Glory of the Sky, 
                                    The Mystery of Terra. 
                                    I purify thee so that 
                           Whatever is wrought by me with thee may, 
                                      In all its powers, 
                       Have a good and speedy effect with good success. 
                          Be purified by my prayer and be powerful! 
      
                                        So mote it be! 
      
      
                      When water  is hot  enough, place  the herbs in the Tea 
                 Pot and add water from the brewing dish, give it a couple of 
                 stirs. 

                                                                             748

                      While the tea is steeping, intone this Prayer. 
      
      
                                         Earth Mother 
                                        Giver of life 
                          Strengthen me during my life-long strife. 
                             Teach me Your ways of perfect love, 
                                   Peace, and wisdom true. 
                                  Spawn from my purest heart 
                                      These words to You 
                              May this prayer help me to better 
                                   Myself in word and deed, 
                              To a higher plane I shall succeed. 
                               Beautiful Light of Goodness Fair 
                                 Lore of old we both do share 
                                A Witch's brew, I drink to You 
                              My love for You, by day, by night 
                                   In thought and in sight 
                                      Will my soul learn 
                               The meaning of this life again. 
      
      
                      Pour out  a cup  for all present, including one for the 
                 Gods, and enjoy. 
                      Sit before the table and meditate on the blessings that 
                 the Gods  have bestowed  upon your  life.   You may  use the 
                 scrying candle  here to  focus upon for your meditation.  If 
                 the Gods  so choose  They may  give you  a Message or Vision 
                 through the blessings of the Sight. 
                      You may  relax now and finish off the pot.  (Note: this 
                 rite is  not to  take the  place of  The Feast, but is to be 
                 used as a time of blessing and communing with the Goddess) 

                                                                             749
