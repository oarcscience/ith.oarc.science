    ---- A WICCANING PART 4 ---



    THE DIVULGENCE OF THE NAMES (explained to the Witnesses):

    ANCIENT EUROPEAN PEOPLES BELIEVED THAT YOU MUST HAVE TWO
    NAMES, ONE PUBLIC AND ONE A SECRET NAME THAT ONLY THOSE
    PRESENT AT THE BLESSING CEREMONY KNEW. THIS SECOND NAME
    IS FOR USE AFTER PUBERTY, WHEN THE SOUL CHANGES INTO ITS
    FIRST ADULT SELF, WHEN IT CAN BE UTTERED ONCE MORE, AND
    MADE PUBLIC. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC NAME WAS TO
    DIVERT THE EVIL EYE, TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THE FATES, TO
    KEEP AWAY SICKNESS, AND TO HELP THE CHILD REACH ADULTHOOD.

    Priestess:
    "Great Spirit of Nature, protect and guide these young souls
    among us. May the Blessings of the wise and joyous Father of the Gods
    far-seeing and far-knowing be upon thee. May the blessings of the Triple
    Goddess, of Maiden, of Mother, of Crone, and all their power
    be upon thee."


    The following blessings/invocations were spoken and followed by
    the child being immersed in the ocean water of the beach where
    the ritual was held:

    ELIZABETH'S DUNKING:

    Anna Perenna
    Great Goddess, Mother of All
    Envelope this daughter of yours
    in the waters of Your womb
    Grant her protection from wrong-doing
    Wash away the memories of her pain
    Shower her with Your blessings
    in a life everlasting
    Bless Elizabeth Mae Luzerne.
    So Mote it Be!



    PATRICK'S DUNKING:

    Great Goddess, Nurturer and Bearer of all Men, great and small
    Without whose womb they would not be
    Mother of Gods, of Sacrificial Kings,
    Presidents, Emperors, and beggars
    Welcome this son of Yours into Your Light
    and as you have taught us, let him find
    "Beauty and strength, power and compassion,
    mirth and reverence, honor and humility"
    within his heart.
    Wash his fears away with your caress!
    Bless Patrick Howard Lloyd!
    Blessed Be!


    MORGAINNE'S DUNKING:

    Hail, o gracious and most magnificent Lady
    whose slender hand turns the vast wheel of the sky.
    whose triple aspect does see
    the beginning, the life, and the end of all things.
    whose wells of mystery do give
    inspiration and rebirth thoughout eternity,
    receive here this small daughter of yours with blessings
    and with love.
    Bless Morgainne Ellayne!
    So mote it be!
