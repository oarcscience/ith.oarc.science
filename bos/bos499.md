                              THE WICCAN REDE
                                      -Anonymous
             (Tune: "Leatherwing Bat" aka "Celtic Circle Dance")

                                                                                    
     Bide the wiccan laws you must,         When ye have and hold a need,         
     In perfect love and perfect trust:     Harken not to others greed            
     Live you must and let to live,         With a fool no season spend,          
     Fairly take and fairly give            Or be counted as his friend           
                                           
     Form the circle thrice about           When misfortune is enow,              
     To keep unwelcome spirits out          Wear the star upon thy brow           
     To bind your spell will every time,    True in love you ever be,             
     Let the spell be spake in rhyme        Lest thy love be false to thee        
                                                                                  
     Soft of eye and light of touch,        Merry meet and merry part,            
     Speak you little, listen much          Bright the cheeks and warm the heart. 
     Deosil go by the waxing moon,          Mind the threefold law you should     
     Chanting out the baleful tune          Three times bad and three times good  
                                            
     When the Lady's moon is new,           Nine woods in the cauldron go,          
     Kiss your hand to her times two        Burn them fast and burn them slow       
     When the moon rides at her peak,       Elder be the Lady's tree,               
     Then your heart's desire seek          Burn it not or cursed you'll be         
                                                                                    
     Heed the north winds mighty gale,      When the wheel begins to turn,          
     Lock the door and trim the sail        Soon the Beltane fires will burn        
     When the wind comes from the south,    When the wheel hath turned a Yule       
     Love will kiss thee on the mouth       Light the log the Horned One rules      
                                                                                    
     When the wind blows from the east,     Heed you flower, bush and tree,         
     Expect the new and set the feast.      By the Lady blessed be                  
     When the wind blows from the west      Where the rippling waters go,           
     Bardic words be at their best!         Cast a stone, the truth you'll know     
                                           
                       Bide the wiccan laws you must,        
                       In perfect love and perfect trust:    
                       These words the wiccan rede fulfill;    
                       "An harm you none, do what you will."   
                                            
                                         *               
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            


                                                                                2283
