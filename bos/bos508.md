                  BURNING TIMES/CHANT       
                              -Charles Murphy
                                            
     In the cool of the evening, they used to gather, 'neath stars in
          the meadow, circled near an old oak tree.
     At the times appointed by the seasons of the Earth, and the phases
          of the moon.                      
     In the center of them stood a woman, equal with the others, and
          respected for her worth.          
     One of the many we call the Witches, the teachers and the keepers
          of the wisdom of the Earth        
     The people grew through the knowledge she gave them, herbs to heal
          their bodies, spells to make their spirits whole.
     Hear them chanting healing incantations, calling forth the Wise
          Ones, celebrating in dance and song
                                            
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
                                            
     There were those who came to power through domination, and they
          bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross.
     They sought control of the common people by demanding allegiance
          to the church of Rome.            
     And the Pope declared the Inquisition, it was a war against the
          women whose power they feared.    
     In this Holocaust against the nature peoples, a million European
          women died.                       
                                            
     And the tales are told of those who, by the hundreds, holding
          together, chose their deaths in the sea.
     Chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess, a refusal of betrayal,
          women were dying to be free.      
                                            
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
                                            
     Now the Earth is a witch, and the men still burn her! Stripping
          her down with mining and the poisons of their wars.
     While to us the Earth is a healer, a teacher, a mother.
     She's the weaver of the web of life that keeps us all alive.
                                            
     She gives us the vision to see through the chaos.
     She gives us the courage, it is our will to survive!
                                            
     Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna....(repeat ad lib)
                                            
                            *               
                                            
                                            
                                            


                                                                                2293
