    O orange candle                                 O salt
                            O pennies

                            O  pine incense         O  water

    On a waxing moon, set the altar in the east of yoru circle.  This will
    need to be left up for a full waxing cycle.  You will need easy access
    to a door.
    Take a new penny in your hand, Circle the altar deosil and say
    "Bring to me what I see By thy power, Hecate,"

    Spin rapidly deosil and go outside and toss the new penny in the air.
    Wherever it lands, bury all 5 pennies, saying:

    "I give thee money - Hecate
    Return to me prosperity.
    I give thee five
    REturn by three
    As I will
    So mote it be."

    Return to your altar and snuff out the candles.

    Next week, at the same day and time, return to your altar with your
    talisman bag and the parchment.  Light the orange candle.  Visualize
    money flowing onto the altar.  Unearth the coins and bring them to the
    altar.  Wash them in the chalice water to purify them.  Pass them
    through the incense smoke and the fire from the orange candle.  Place
    each coin in the talisman pouch, old coins first.  Add nine pieces of
    rock salt, close the mouth of the talisman pouch and face east and say:

    "Bring to me
    what I see
    By thy power
    Hecate.
    Altar power
    Must it be
    Earth and Air
    Fire and Sea
    Bring to me
    What I see
    By thy power
    Hecate."

    Place the bag inside your cloting and wear it every day for 7 days. 
    Leave it on your altar every night visualizing prosperity.  On the 7th
    day, hide it in the eastern portion of your house.

    There it is.  It's a complicated spell, but it does work.
