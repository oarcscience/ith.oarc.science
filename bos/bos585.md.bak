                        HOUSE BLESSING 
    Assemble:
    1.  Salt & Water
    2.  Incense (fire and air)
    3.  Milk & Honey
    4.  Oil (for anointing)
    5.  Wine (for offering)
    6.  Bells, Pots, Pans, Whistles, etc.

    Cast a circle in the main room (livingroom) and after casting, visualize
    the circle expanding to include the entire house. Call upon the spirits
    and energies living in the house (or apartment). Invite those who will
    be harmonious with the new household and its energies to remain.
    Invite/ask those who will be happier elsewhere to depart.  Release all
    "energies" not compatible with the new household.  (This may be
    expressed as a "release" in order to unbind anything that may be stuck.)

    Then call upon, greet, and invite ancestors, patron deities, and all
    harmonious spirits and energies to dwell in the house as they please.

    Gather up the pots, pans, and all the noise-makers.  Go to each door and
    window, not forgetting the fire-place and dog-door, making as much
    racket as humanly possible--to shoo out anything unwanted.  (This is
    hysterical fun, and also raises lots of energy for the next important
    step.) Go again throughout the house and at each portal (door, window,
    etc.) sprinkle salt-water and cense, saying: "By the Elements I purify
    and charge this portal."  Then anoint the portal with milk and honey,
    saying: "By Milk and Honey I ensure prosperity and peace within this
    place."  Finally, anoint the portal with oil, saying: "With Oil I seal
    this portal and protect all within."  At the front door a special prayer
    is said, asking the guardian deities (God & Goddess) to freely grant
    entry to all frien ds and loved ones, and to prevent passage (turn
    aside) to any who would do harm." Then, if it's a house--pour wine
    across the width of the threshold; if it's an apartment anoint the
    threshold with light touches of wine.

    The house-holders then each take a sip of wine, leaving some as an
    offering to the Gods, and the Circle should be closed.  The remaining
    wine, milk, and honey should be offered to the Gods.  (In our case to

    the fruit tree and the oak tree in our yard.)

    Addenda: This is very effective if done as part of a house-warming
    party, followed by much  feasting.  It has also been done very
    effectively by two people.  It only takes about 30 minutes to do a large
    house.  You _can_ take the time.

    Do make certain to "ground" afterward, by closing the circle and by
    eating.  This ritual can "stir" up everybody and make the house feel
    full of "buzzy" energy.
