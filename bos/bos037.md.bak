# Public Service Announcement for Immediate Release

**Samhain** (pronounced saw-an), commonly referred to as Halloween, is a
religious holiday celebrated by Wiccan and witch. The festival
traditionally is a feast for the gathering of the family in love and
remembrance. All the family including one's ancestors.

Wiccans do not regard physical death as an end but merely one more event
in a continuing progress of the soul's in its path toward fulfillment of
divine destiny. Because of these beliefs, it is only natural at this
time of year to invite our beloved ancestors to remember and to
celebrate with us.

If you do not find these beliefs in conflict with your own personal
beliefs, please join us in the following ritual of thanksgiving and
remembrance.

Whether you join with us or not,

May you walk in the Light of the Lady

Blessed Be.

The clergy and members of the United Wiccan Church.

After you have shared the bounty of your harvest with the children of
your neighborhood (candy, etc) and the house has settled down for the
night, disconnect or turn off your telephone so that this state of
serenity will continue uninterrupted.

Prepare a special feast of whatever foods reminds you of a special
departed friend or family member, or of past family gatherings. While
you are preparing this feast think of all of the good times you had with
them.

When the feast is prepared, set your holiday table with a special place
of honor for the departed friend or family member.

Decorate the table and room as you would for a holiday dinner with the
family, add those special things that are important to you and your
family (flowers, candles,etc.) If you have a picture of the loved one,
it is nice to place it at their place at the table.

Speak to that special person and invite them to join you in this
celebration and time of remembrance. It is completely appropriate to say
grace or offer any prayer that you feel is fitting.

### The following is done in complete silence:

Serve the meal remembering to serve your honored guest (or guests)
first. If wine or other alcoholic beverages are served, it is
recommended that they be kept in moderation as you and your guests need
to have a clear head.

Now sit down to the table with your loved ones and enjoy your feast.
When you address them in your mind, always see them as well. (Try not to
say in your mind, "if you can hear me...", etc.). After the meal, the
time of silence is over. Do whatever you normally do at a family holiday
gathering (clear the table, play games, sing songs, etc.). Enjoy the
companionship.

When the evening is over, or in the morning if you wish to make it an
all night party, thank your invited guests for being with you and for
making your celebration a special one.

There are a few words of caution that we will offer.

If this ritual does not feel right for you, do *not* do it. Follow your
instincts.

Remember that crossing over does not necessarily change a person, so if
you could not get through a meal in peace with them while they were
alive, you will probably have the same problem with their spirit.

Do not ask your guest to grant you wishes or do you favors. It is rude
to invite a guest and then make it obvious that a favor is the reason
they were asked, not because of love and respect. Spirits do *not* like
rudeness! Besides, spirits often forget that you are limited in ways
that they are not. If you ask them for $1,000, it may come as an
insurance settlement after a painful break in your water pipe with all
the delight in cleaning up the mess from ensuing water damage.
