                              *             
                                            
                        TWO MAGICIANS       
                         (Child #44)        
           recorded by Steeleye Span "Below the Salt"
                                            
      She looked out of the window, as white as any milk
      He looked in at the window, as black as any silk
                                            
      (Chorus): Hello, hello, hello, hello you coal black smith
                You have done me no harm!   
                You never shall have my maidenhead
                That I have kept so long!   
                I'd rather die a maid, aye, and then she said,
                And be buried all in my grave,
                Than to have such a nasty,  
                husky, dusky, fusty, musty coal black smith!
                A maiden I will die!        
                                            
      She became a duck, a duck all in the stream
      And he became a waterdog, and fetched her back again
                                            
      She became a star, a star all in the night
      And he became a thundercloud and muffled her out of sight
                                            
      She became a rose, a rose all in the wood
      And he became a bumblebee and kissed her where she stood
                                            
      She became a nun, a nun all dressed in white
      And he became a chantry priest to pray for her by night
                                            
      She became a trout, a trout all in the brook
      And he became a feathered fly, and catched her with his hook
                                            
      She became a quilt, a quilt all on her bed
      And he became a coverlet, and gained her maidenhead!
