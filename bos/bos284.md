                                    The Dark Night of the Soul 

                                          Fra.: Apfelmann

                           ------------------------------------------- 



                   "The Dark Night of the Soul" is the name given to that experience

              of spiritual desolation that  all students of the Occult  pass through

              at one time or another. It is sometimes charcterised  by feelings that

              your occult  studies or practises are not taken you anywhere, that the

              initial success  that one is sometimes  granted after a few  months of

              occult working, has suddenly dried up. There comes a desire to give up

              on everything,  to abandon exercises and meditation,  as nothing seems

              to be  working. St.John of the Cross. a christian mystic, said of this

              experience,  that  it; "...puts  the  sensory  spiritual appetites  to

              sleep, deadens them,  and deprives them of the ability  to find pleas-

              ure in  anything.  It binds the imagination, and impeeds it from doing

              any  good  discursive work.  It makes the  memory cease, the intellect

              become   dark and unable to  understand anything, and hence  it causes

              the will to become arrid and constrained, and all  the faculties empty

              and useless. And over this hangs  a dense and burdensome cloud,  which

              afflicts the soul, and keeps it withdrawn from the good."  

                   Though the beginner may view the onset of such an experience with

              alarm (I know I did), the "Dark Night" is  not something bad or destr-

              uctive. In one sense  it may be seen as  a trial, a test by  which the

              Gods examine  our resolve to continue with occult work, and if you are

              not completely  whole-hearted about your magical studies, it is during

              this  period (at its beginning) that you  will give up. The Dark Night

              of the  Soul should be welcomened,  once recognised for what  it is (I

              have always received an innate "warning" just before the onset of such

              a period),  as a person  might welcome an  operation that  will secure

              health  and wellbeing. St.John of  the Cross embraced  the soul`s Dark


                                                                                1412

              Night as a  Devine Appointment, calling it  a period of "sheer  grace"

              and adding; 

               "O guiding Night, 

               O Night more lovely than Dawn, 

               O Night that has united the lover with his beloved 

               Transforming the Lover in her Beloved." 

               

                   When entering  the Dark  Night  one is  overcome  by a  sense  of

              spiritual dryness and  depression. The notion, in some  quarters, that

              all  such experiences  should be  avoided, for  a peaceful  existence,

              shows up the  superficiality of  so much of  contemporary living.  The

              Dark Night is a  way of bringing the Soul  to stillness, so that  deep

              psychic transformation  may take place.  All distractions must  be set

              aside, and it is no good attempting  to fight or channel the bursts of

              raw energy  that from time to time may course through your being. This

              inner  compulsion to set everything aside results in the outer depres-

              sion, when nothing seems to excite. 

               


                                                                                1413

                   The only thing to do is obey your inner voice and become still, 

              waiting for the inner transformation, (which the "Dark Night" heralds-

              ), to  take place. You may  not be aware for  a very long  time of the

              results of that inner change, but  when the desire to work comes again

              and the depression lifts, the Dark Night has (for a moment) passed. No

              one  can help  during this  time, and  in many  cases there  is hardly

              anyone  to turn for advice. One must disregard the well-meaning advice

              of family and friends to "snap out of it" this is no  ordinary depres-

              sion, but a deep spiritual experience which only those who have passed

              through themselves (in other words to a magical retreat) but for many,

              as the routines  of everyday life  prohibits this, all  you can do  is

              cultivate an inner  solitude, a  stillness and silence  of heart,  and

              wait, (like a  chrysalis waits for the inner  changes that will result

              in  a butterfly) for the Transformation to  work itself out. There are

              many  such  "Dark Nights"  that the  occult  seeker must  pass through

              during the mysterious process  of mitigation. They are all  trials but

              experience teaches one to cope more efficiently.
