                                        A CALL TO LORD AND LADY 
                  
                    She lives and breathes upon the Earth 
                    Her wheel spins round the hub of June 
                    She is the web of life and birth 
                    Her smile floats softly with the moon 
                  
                    Heart of life, and caring mother 
                    Loving sister, noble princess 
                    Firebird spirit, restless lover 
                    Shadowy hidden sorceress 
                  
                    His strength is there in mountains high 
                    His lightning flys from air and cloud 
                    His horn heralds the wild hunt's ride 
                    He quickens forest, roaring proud 
                  
                    Children's friend, protecting father 
                    Watchful brother, noble fighter 
                    Laughing wise one, dark magister 
                    Player of pipes, thoughtful sheperd 
                  
                    Their faces many, countless names 
                    Pan, Diana, Zeus, Astarte 
                    Teachers from dreams, oracle's flames 
                    Speak, and guide us within our hearts 
                                     - J.A.B. 14 Feb 89 

                                                                                               1855
