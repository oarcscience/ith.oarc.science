                            Risk Assessment Within The Craft Community 
                                         By Weyland Smith


                      There seems to betwo schools of thought within the "Craft Com-
              munity"  concerning the dangers faced by Pagans in general and witches
              in particular.  One school thinks that we  are now in the  Age of Aqu-
              arius  and that all  danger has passed.  The other camp  seems to feel
              that we  are beset  with  dangers and  that our  only  safety lies  in
              remaining "the hidden  children of the Goddess", telling no one of our
              religious faith (including our  fellow practitioners), and being ready
              to fly or fight on a moment's notice. Who's right? Do we know? Have we
              even tried to find out?

                    On theone hand, we live in a countrywith a Bill of Rights. Times
              have  certainly changed  since  witchcraft was  a  hanging offence  in
              Massachusetts. People have been known to proclaim their faith and live
              unmolested. On the other hand, there are about 3 million people in the
              United States who profess themselves to believe that the Bible  is the
              literal word  of God. If Leviticus says "Thou shalt not suffer a witch
              to live.",  then there should be  3 million people out  there ready to
              drag me out of my house and kill me.

                    Fortunately, the answer  does not  lie with  either extreme  and
              therefore our reaction should  likewise avoid either extreme position.
              We live  in a world  beset by  dangers. We could  be in a  traffic ac-
              cident.  We could  have  our house  burglarized.  Our child  could  be
              abducted on the  way home from school. We could  be struck by lighten-
              ing. Do we stay  home, guard the house and family and avoid living? Of
              course not!

                    What we DOis to act in sucha way as to recognize therisks we run
              and to minimize them. We try to live in reasonably safe neighborhoods.
              We keep  good locks on our  doors. We drive defensively  and wear seat
              belts.  We teach our children to run from threatening situations. This
              isn't paranoia, just good sense.

                      Is thereany danger that we as witches and pagans might be sub-
              jected to another  violent suppression? Any Jew with an  eye to recent
              history would tell  you that of course there is!  Is that danger great
              here  in this  country? Not  at  present, but  we do  live in  a world
              subject  to  rapid changes.  Within  my lifetime,  people  of Japanese
              extraction in this country  were summarily rounded up and  shipped off
              to  remote camps.  This action  was contested  all the  way up  to the
              Supreme Court to no avail.


                                                                                1724
              

                 
                 So what should we do?

                    Well for a  start, recognize  that there is  SOME residual  risk
              whenever anyone  takes an  ethical position.  We must  understand that
              this risk is present whether we think it should be so or not. Further,
              we must each decide what level  of hazard we are personally willing to
              run and to  which we would  subject our families.  Finally, we  should
              avoid doing anything which might subject ourselves and those around us
              to  risks when such risks are avoidable. Especially, we should respect
              one another's right  to manage his own dangers. Just  because I choose
              to take a risk doesn't give me the right to endanger you!

                    Should wereturn to living ourlives under perpetual cover?I  hope
              not. But I do respect the individual rights of my brothers and sisters
              of  the Art to  each make that  decision on  their own. It  is on this
              middle  ground  where I  suggest we  should all  try  to live  for the
              present.

                


                                                                                1725
