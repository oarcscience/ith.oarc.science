                                        COVEN OFFICES 
          
          
          
         Leadership in a mixed coven: 
          
         1.  High Priestess - Coordinates ritual leadership, counseling,  
         teaching, and administration duties, in company with the High  
         Priest.  Chief representative of the Goddess energies at rituals.  
         Badge of office:  crescent Moon crown or coronet of candles. 
          
         2.  High Priest - See above.  Chief representative of the God  
         energies at rituals.  Badge of office:  horned headdress or animal  
         mask. 
          
         3.  Maiden - Understudy to the High Priestess, and substitutes for 
         her when necessary.  Badge of office may be a simple silver  
         circlet or tiara. 
          
         4.  Summoner - Understudy to the High Priest, who substitutes for  
         him when necessary.  Main administrative deputy, passing out  
         information, collecting dues, letting people know when to meet and 
         what to bring, etc.  Also called the "Man in Black," "Black Rod,"  
         or "Verdelet."  Badge of office may be a blackthorn staff. 
          
          
          
         Leadership in an all-woman's coven: 
          
         One pattern:  No hierarchy or titles at all:  ritual leadership  
         rotates, other jobs are carried out by anyone capable and willing. 
          
          
         Another pattern: 
          
          
         1.  Maiden - Understudy to the Mother, and chief administrative  
         deputy (see Summoner's duties above) 
          
         2.  Mother - Coordinates ritual leadership and administration,  
         guides coven projects and activities.  She does not necessarily do 
         these jobs herself always, but has the responsibility to see that  
         they are apportioned fairly and done effectively. 
          
         3.  Crone - Chief counselor to the Mother, and does a large share  
         of teaching and individual counseling.  May perform divination on  
         questions of concern to the coven.  Possibly a former "Mother" or  
         High Priestess, experienced and skilled in magick, herbalism, etc. 
          
          
          
         For both mixed and single-sex coven: 
          
         Council of Elders - A gathering of all the higher-rank initiates  
         in the coven.  They may function as advisors to the coven leaders, 
         or may actually set policy, establish the budget etc.  In the  
         latter case, coven leaders are essentially executives responsible  
         to the Elders. 


                                                                                 763
