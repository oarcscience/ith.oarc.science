                              *             
                                            
                      ALL THRU THE NIGHT    
                               -Traditional
                                            
      While the Moon her watch is keeping   
                      all thru the night    
      While the weary world is sleeping     
                      all thru the night    
      O'er thy spirit gently stealing,      
      Visions of delight revealing          
      Breathes a pure and holy feeling      
                      all thru the night    
                                            
      Though this Bard must roam full lonely
      My true harp shall sing praise only   
      Love's soft dream, alas, is over      
      Yet my strains of love shall hover    
      Near the Presence of my Lover         
                                            
      Hark! A solemn bell is ringing        
      Thou, my King are heavenward winging  
      Earthly dust from off Thee shaken     
      Soul immortal shalt thou waken        
      With thy last, dim journey taken      
                                            
      Neath this Stone my King is sleeping  
      Stars around Him softly sweeping      
      Once and Future King preserving       
      Britain's Saviour there reserving     
      All around him Stars observing        
                      all thru the night    
                                            
      Holl am ran-tire sehr thuh wed-ont    
                      ahr heed ah nos       
      Dum-ar forth ee vro go-gawn-yont      
                      ahr heed ah nos       
      Gol-i ar-all you tuh wull ooch        
      ee are thang os gweer bred vairtch-ooch
      tie-leer nave oith m'yoon thu-wail-ooch
                      ahr heed ah nos       
                                            
              note: The last verse is phonetic Welsh.
                    "ll" is pronounced by putting the tip of your
                    tongue to the roof of your mouth, and saying "h"
                    and "l" at the same time...sort of.
                    "ch" is pronounced as German.
                                            
                              *             
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            


                                                                                2306
