This is a large (+9Mb) collection of articles related to Neo-Paganism
which can be found archived at a number of FTP sites (for instance,
[here](ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/religion/neopagan/BOS/).md). This is a
collection of posts to bulletin boards from the late eighties to the mid
nineties, essentially predating the modern Internet. According to a
recent communication, the original editor of this archive was Durwydd
mac Tara at PODS net. We acknowledge Durwydd's hard work to preserve
this archive. For ease of access, we have converted this archive to HTML
using a C program. There are a number of technical difficulties with
this collection including runtogetherwords in many places, problems with
the table of contents and huge inconsistencies in pagination; due to the
volume of this material we have left these intact for now.

We have taken the liberty of removing about twenty-five articles which
were too far 'off topic', posted elsewhere at this site, or had serious
copyright issues. Three articles have been removed at the request of the
authors. Other than the omitted articles we have made no attempt to
alter any of the content.

#### *NOTE ON COPYRIGHTS*

[![](../cnote.gif)](../cnote.md) Practically all of the files below are
copyrighted but redistributable for non-commercial purposes. Consult
each file for particulars.

NOTE: As most of these postings were archived many years ago, we have no
way to contact the authors of any of these documents. Therefore we can't
arrange copyright clearances for any of these pieces or give you the
email addresses of the authors. Some of the may have a web presence and
you may be able to find them by searching for them through search
engines, but because of time limitations we can't directly assist you in
this process.

CD-ROM note: For copyright reasons, none of the files on this page are
included on the sacred-texts CD-ROM, although it does have most of the
public domain files from the [neopagan section](../pag/index.md).
