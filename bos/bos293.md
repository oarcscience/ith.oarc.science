                                         Prosperity Spell 

                                          Rowan Moonstone 

              The following is a quarterly prosperity spell given to me by Angel and
              Gracie,  my first two FamTrad teachers.  I have no idea where they got
              it, but I can  tell you that it DOES work.  I"ve used it for years and
              it never fails to  bring me some unlooked for money.  I find that I've
              overpaid a bill, or an old  debt which  I had written off as uncollec-
              tible gets repaid,  I find a $20 on  the  sidewalk, etc.    Try it, it
              works!

              The spell is to  begin at one  minute past midnight  SUN TIME (I  HATE
              daylight savings  time when I  do this.  Means  1AM!) on the  night of
              April 30 (May 1), July 31 (Aug 1), Oct 31 (Nov. 1) and Jan 31 (Feb  1)
              In other words, on the first minute of the cross quarter day.

              You will need the following:

              1 gold candle
              6 green candles  
              9 white candles
              Pine oil for anointing candles
              salt

              All candles  must be dressed with  pine oil and then  arranged as fol-
              lows:

              gold candle in the center
              green candles in a circle around gold candle
              white candles in a circle around green candles.


              At one minute past midnight on  the appointed day, trace a salt circle
              around the outermost circle  of candles, light the gold  candle first,
              then  the green candles, moving deosil, then the white candles, moving
              deosil.   Circle  the altar  three times,  chanting "Orbiting  Jupiter
              trine the sun, bring  money on the run."   Do the chant 3  times also.
              Sit  quietly  for a  few minutes  and  visualize your  monetary NEEDS.
              (needs, not desires).  The SNUFF (do not blow or pinch) the candles in
              reverse order.

              That's it.  That's all there is to it and it works beautifully.  Since
              Lammas  is coming up, thought  I'd post it for everyone  to see.  I've
              got a bunch more stuff from these two ladies if  anyone is interested.
              They  worked a  great deal   with  Archangels and  I suspect  a strong
              Kabalistic crossover in there  somewhere.  But the spells  and rituals
              DO work quite nicely.
