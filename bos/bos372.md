                                               TO THE DRAGONS, REBORN 
                  - 
                    They say the flame wrought winds are dead; 
                     Ethereal dancing, jeweled wings - no more. 
                    Monolithic rationality is the head. 
                     Noble dreams and works - shattered, torn. 
                  - 
                    Their world was theirs - never doubt. 
                     But the magic and power faded away, 
                    When the light gave way to spiritual drought 
                     and Oppenheimer replaced Morganna Le Fay. 
                  - 
                    But in some strange souls they found a home: 
                     Those inspired, lost, exiled castaways. 
                    Music and verse and The Craft are the bones 
                     Of these long lost archetypes of elder days. 
                  - 
                    And it takes a mere seed to create an oak, 
                     and music and light, rain and mirth, 
                    bridging land and sky with it's growth; 
                     fulfilling the call to renew the Earth. 
                  - 
                    So nurture these dragons who live within you- 
                     The Burning has ended and they may go free. 
                    Let them grow so that their work may continue. 
                     An it harm none, do what ye will - Blessed Be! 
                  -
