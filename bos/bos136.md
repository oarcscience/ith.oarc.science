                        PSYCHIC SELF-DEFENSE                     by =Carlin=
         
              One of the problems which faces the aspiring witch  or magician is
         an increased sensitivity to and awareness of the "unseen" forces of the
         world.   Usually  this sensitivity  is a  delight, but  occasionally it
         becomes a  nightmare --  in the  most literal sense  of the  word.   In
         particular,  this article  deals  with what  spiritualists and  shamans
         would  refer to as  spirit obsession  -- a  cluster of  "symptoms" that
         differ from possession, but that still can destroy the integrity of the
         victims <AND ALSO>  gives some background information on obsession, and
         then  outlines  a few  "generic"  techniques  that will  benefit  those
         subject to this form of "psychic harassment."

                           DEFINING OBSESSION

              Obsession occurs in  every nation and  subculture,and as a  result
         every  magical subculture has had it's own  way of defining and dealing
         with  the phenomena involved.   Modern medicine, with  the exception of
         Jungian and "New Age" psychiatry/psychology, tends to dismiss obsession
         as  either hysteria or budding schizophrenia.  The major religions, for
         the  most part, now  agree with this  evaluation.  Of  course, the "New
         Right"  fundamentalists are likely to  see a demon  in every corner....
         Either  of these approaches tends to disempower the afflicted person by
         destroying  her/his trust  in his  own inner  processes and  making him
         dependent on the "expert" who will control the attempt to cure him/her.
         Spiritualists  will  warn you  against  psychic  attack or  unprotected
         dealings with the  Dead.   Work  <?> will tell you that  the problem is
         either openness to astral influences or rebellion within the psyche <OR
         "ALL OF  THE ABOVE">.  There is more to  being human than the conscious
         mind, and  unintegrated and unrecognized "complexes"  within the psyche
         will  sometimes have  separate agendas  that can  lead to  "attack from
         within" if  those needs  are continually  ignored.     My own  tendency
         <PERHAPS  "BIAS"  OR "APPROACH"  IS A BETTER  WORD> is  philosophically
         Jungian-to-agnostic,but  practically   Shamanic.     I  tend   to  view
         such"entities" as  psychological.  However,  the techniques  I use  are
         more effective if the problem is "projected" outward and  treated as if
         it were the  result of attack by a sentient being.   Even if obsessions
         are  caused by "complexes", a  truly well established  complex takes on
         enough  "life" to be regarded as a "secondary personality" demanding of
         respect.  If someone is having to live with obsession, chances are that
         the  person is more interested  in resolving the  problem than debating
         metaphysics.   The  methodology  outlined below  is  designed to  work,
         whether  you  agree  with the  philosophy  behind  it  or not.    These
         techniques  are "homeopathic"  in  nature, contrived  with the  idea of
         strengthening the victIm's  "psychic immune system" to the  point where
         s/he no longer can be victimized. Without this increase in inner power,
         the person can  be temporarily  freed from the  obsession, but  remains
         vulnerable to "evil influence" in the future.

                                                                             596

                       THE BEGINNINGS OF OBSESSION

              Checking a person's personal history,  one will usually find  that
         obsessions  begin during  periods  where  stress,negative emotions,  or
         injury have  impaired that person's  natural self-protective abilities.
         Or  where  the  person   has  been  unprepared  or  confused   and  has
         intentionally or unintentionally "dropped his/her guard" around someone
         already  disturbed.  Or  where the person has  been abused and degraded
         since  early childhood and is consequently continually open to negative
         influences<LAST   THREE   SENTENCES   NEED   TO   BE  "SMOOTHER">.   In
         psychological terminology, old "complexes" are cathected during periods
         when the ego is  foundered in depression, weakening the  "auric shield"
         that normally will protect against "outside influences," as well as the
         physical body.  This auric shield can also be "pierced" during "psychic
         attacks," leaving a "hole"  through which invading astral-organisms can
         pass freely. In the same way, "evil spirits" are contagious. Emotional,
         sexual, or magical intimacy with someone already obsessed can allow the
         entity  to  pass over  to oneself.  And an  extreme  period of  rage or
         vengefulness can attract like to like, bringing one to the attention of
         "vengeful creatures" in the "lower astral."

                          SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION

              Among the most common symptoms of obsession is a brooding fixation
         upon some negative thought or act.  The obsessed person being unable to
         "turn  off"  the voice  that urges  her/him  on to  self-destructive or
         vindictive acts. The idea that one is the Messiah or the rightful ruler
         of the universe, or too low to continue to live  may repeatedly intrude
         upon  consciousness.   To consider  much addictive  behavior to  be the
         result  of obsession by  "earth-bound spirits" or  elementals<???>.  No
         longer having physical bodies,  the "astral low-lifes" push susceptible
         living  humans into  overindulging  in whatever  the discarnate  entity
         still craves.    In other cases, the symptoms take  other forms.  Sleep
         can  be disrupted  by  repeated  nightmares  or  night  terrors.    The
         individual may awaken with no memory  of the contents of the dream, but
         over time  will develop insomnia  or a  fear of sleep.   Especially  in
         children,the shadows  of night  can resolve themselves  into terrifying
         images,  and there  can be  an overwhelming  sense of  being constantly
         watched.    Visual  "hallucinations"  may  force  themselves  onto  the
         physical plane or may manifest themselves solely upon the "mind's eye."
         At  times the obsession can be relatively benign. Budding magicians can
         "pick  up  hitchhikers"  during   their  initial  workings,  and  these
         "creatures" may well content themselves with acting as Guardians of its
         cases the  "entities" will only  "act out"when  the magician  re-enters
         trance or attempts to work  on the astral levels<PATCH IT UP>.   People
         who  work  with  divinatory  techniques  without  proper  training  and
         grounding are  especially vulnerable,  with the  Ouija board  being the
         worst offender.   This is  one reason that  the traditional  religions,
         which  do   not  want   the   general  populace   trained  in   magical
         techniques,urge people away from divinatory practices.  Obsessions that
         strike those  not trained to magick  are usually not so  courteous.  In
         the  more entrenched  cases,physical symptoms  other than  insomnia can
         manifest.  Especially  when one  is very  tired  or ill,  the obsession
         attempt  can escalate and begin to unbalance the homeostatic mechanisms
         of the  body.   Constipation,sinusitis and  migraine headaches are  the
         more usual manifestations, along with extreme pallor, edema, and mental
         confusion and  memory  loss.   Poltergeist activity  is also  sometimes
         reported.The obsessing entity can also color the impressions of others.

                                                                             597

         One  can suddenly find oneself  being accused of  unsavory attitudes or
         persistently  misunderstood.     At  the  same   time,  truly  unsavory
         characters will be attracted to the new image and will begin to  pop up
         out of the woodwork.

                         THE MAGICAL APPROACH

              There are  many  things that  one  can  do if  one  suspects  that
         obsession  has occurred.   One  can treat  it as  a  demon and  turn to
         spiritual  authority for help.  One can  treat it as mental illness and
         turn  to  psychiatric explanations.    One  can ignore  it  as much  as
         possible, or begin to avoid the activities that call it forth.  One can
         also "raise one's  energies" using self-help  techniques such as  those
         outlined  in  following  paragraphs.Any  one  of  the  above  reactions
         cripples one as a magician, however.  From a ceremonial viewpoint,  one
         must pass the "Guardian on the Threshold" before one can pass on to the
         next  level of development.From a Jungian  standpoint, one must develop
         rapport  with and "reintegrate"  the rejected portion;  from a Shamanic
         standpoint, one must "turn" the entity and either dismiss it or convert
         it into a spirit helper<?>.

           THE INNER DIALOGUE

              Step one, using the magical approach, is to become acquainted with
         the "entity" and  engage it  in dialogue.In some  instances the  entity
         will turn out to be malevolent, in other's only "immature" or  confused
         and angry at being ignored.   Before engaging in this activity,  one is
         advised to ground and  center, and to shield  in whatever manner  one's
         tradition suggests. One  is also advised to  begin/continue in whatever
         other  spiritually protective exercises  one has  faith in.If  there is
         someone available to work  with the afflicted person, have  that helper
         prepare a  list of non-leading(Not  "are you a  demon?," but "what  are
         you?") questions.  Then drop  into light trance and Then let  the other
         person ask the questions while the  victim answers with the first thing
         that  pops  into his/her  head.   In effect,  s/he will  be voluntarily
         "channelling"  for  the  entity's  unconscious   and  perhaps  "denied"
         (officially) circumstances.If there is no other person, then the victim
         must  do whatever  form  of  divination  or  trance  work  he/she  have
         developed  to   contact  his/her   subconscious.    Those   with  vivid
         imaginations can simply  find a quiet moment and ask  "are you there?,"
         personifying  the  "entity"  in  the  same  way  that  children  create
         imaginary  friends.  Afterwards, no matter what the technique used, the
         obsessed  person is to be certain that  his/her aura is closed and that
         s/he is grounded and centered. AFTER  "CONTACT" At this point s/he  may
         have failed to  make contact.In which case there is  nothing to him/her
         to do but repeat the exercise until either it works or s/he is  sure it
         isn't  going to work.  If real contact  does not occur, then s/he might
         attempt to simply banish "it".  It is possible that the entity will not
         answer directly, but will  begin to up<INCREASE> its activity  level or
         bring a  string of  unusual circumstances  into  the obsessed  person's
         life.

                                                                             598

                   It is  more likely,  however, the<Y>  have begun a  dialogue.
         Sometimes "complexes"are  immature parts of our  own personalities that
         will calm  down and begin  to behave themselves  once "they"  no longer
         feel  that they are being ignored.If the  obsessing image is that of an
         animal, or even an ugly humanoid  being, then it may simply be  time to
         intensify one's spiritual  quest and  face down one's  power animal  or
         dark side.  Frequently, these allies will attempt to come to the aid of
         someone  undergoing   psychic  attack,  and  because   of  the  general
         atmosphere of  fear,will  be  perceived  as  threats  and  turned  away
         themselves.Eventually,   in  either  case   the  "entity"   can  either
         be"reintegrated" into the personality, or  "kept" as a spirit-helper by
         those with shamanic leanings.  If one is ALSO under psychic attack, the
         ally  will probably  help  in  the  defense  once  asked  and  properly
         recognized.

                                 "LOST SOULS" AND WORSE 

              On the other hand, "it" may  claim to be a spirit or  other entity
         that  requires help.   If the request  is not  ridiculous <d>o consider
         honoring it. The author  has personally dealt with a  "poltergeist" who
         claimed to be a woman who had died of yellow fever  over a century ago.
         When questioned, the "spirit" was confused at first, then admitted that
         she had died in delirium  and had not realized that she  was dead until
         "awakened" out  of her stupor by some young people using a Ouija board.
         When  asked what  she  wanted,  the  reply  was "Pray  for  me."    The
         poltergeist activity ended as soon as prayers were begun, and the  last
         message received  from the spirit was "Thank God, I'm free."  Not being
         able to  make herself  understood on  the material  plane by any  other
         means, the "spirit" had resorted to knocking physical objects around to
         attract  attention.  If someone of "mediumistic" nature had been about,
         she  might have  obsessed  that  person  instead in  her  bid  to  gain
         attention.   The  obsession would  have become  malevolent only  if the
         obsessed person repeatedly blocked  her out or otherwise caused  her to
         <?>become cases  of obsession  in relatively "normal"persons  will fall
         into one of  the first few categories.In  rare cases, the obsessed  may
         have had  his/her attempt at  contact met with a  voice screaming "DIE,
         DIE, DIE."   Or  something  similar and  profane.   This  is where  the
         spiritual practices  suggested in the  following paragraphs will  be of
         greatest  benefit, followed by  professional help or  even exorcism, if
         necessary.   (Even  where  an  entity  seems  totally  hostile,  it  is
         sometimes  possible to  "turn" it  through raising  "light"as described
         below.)

                                                                             599

                        SELF-HELP WITH OBSESSION

              Not everyone  is a magician  and not everyone  wishes to  open the
         "can of worms"  of the subconscious.The  following activities are  very
         useful  in "uprooting"spiritual  obsession by  increasing "light".   In
         cases of  "mild" obsession  only a  few of  these measures,or a  simple
         ritual of  dismissal, will be  sufficient to  be rid of  the problem.In
         more entrenched  cases, these techniques  should be  continued for  the
         healing period, accompanied  by Inner Work, depth psychology,  or other
         techniques  that  promote  self-understanding.    Those suffering  from
         physical symptoms  should also work  to strengthen their  immune system
         and  improve their  diet  and lifestyle.    If possible,  the  severely
         afflicted  individual  should have  a  counselor,  teacher, or  trusted
         friend monitor his/her progress "just in case."

                           EXAMPLE TECHNIQUES FOR "RAISING THE LIGHT"

              For  a  period of  three months,  the  obsessed   should "cleanse"
         him/herself  daily  in  whatever  manner  her/his  spiritual  tradition
         decrees.   Grounding  and  centering are  excellent  techniques, as  is
         renewing oneself through visualizing the aura as  strong and untainted.
         One can draw  pictures of oneself expelling all darkness or meditate on
         the  same image.Prayer is useful,  as is catching  oneself thinking the
         old negative thoughts and declaring that one has "taken that out of the
         Law"  or "averted" the consequences.   If the afflicted has friends who
         engage in spiritual pursuits, send him/her mental support  and positive
         energy.   The individual is also advised to spend time in sacred places
         where evil is barred from entering, and to refrain from  the company of
         persons s/he knows  are bad  for her/him.If already  attuned to  ritual
         work,  the  victim can"cleanse"  his/her home  or  have it  cleansed by
         someone trusted.   Those who have  faith in Holy Water  should sprinkle
         and apply it liberally.   Afterwards, if the obsessed  is truly serious
         about being rid of a persistent  fixation, s/he can burn white  candles
         constantly  while awake  and at home.   This  will act  as a  symbol of
         the"light" one wishes  to draw  into one's  life.   The most  seriously
         affected  are advised to surround  their beds with  a protective circle
         and  never to  sleep in  a darkened  room.   Other religious/protective
         symbols can be placed in sight and called upon, and protective incenses
         such as sandalwood may be burned.  The important thing is to keep one's
         spiritual goal constantly in mind and the"entity<?> one's determination
         to improve. This may  seem like a great deal of  effort, but the effect
         will be  to "open" the individual to  positive influences, even if s/he
         doesn't  believe in  "demons".The individual  will be  "raising his/her
         energy" level to the point where  something "dark" cannot even bear  to
         approach her/him, and keeping the energy "high"for a long enough period
         that "it" will become  "discouraged" and fade from sight.At the  end of
         the  three months, the "entity" should either be weakened severely from
         being "starved" or  should be gone.   If  it is gone,  then a  ritually
         adept person can  do a  rededication wherein the  formerly obsessed  is
         declared sealed  against recurrences. If the problem still exists, then
         the  cause  may actually  be  mental  illness  brought  on by  a  brain
         imbalance or early trauma.  In any case, entrenchment of that degree of
         severity is beyond the scope of any self-help article to deal with.  In
         every  case the author has seen or dealt with however, vast improvement
         over the three month period<?>.

                                                                             600

                                 DIANISM IN A NUIT-SHELL 

                   Recently, I got back in touch with my teacherafter nearly two
         years and dropped a  couple of bombshells on her:  I had changed gender
         identity and  had come together with  two other women to  form a Dianic
         coven.  When the initial shock wore off, Rita sent me a complete run of
         Protean Synthesis and a solicitation for this article.

                   Several yearsago I subscribed toseveral stereotypes regarding
         "those  peculiar Dianics".   They  were thealogically  unbalanced, they
         hated men, they denied that men had souls, they were all lesbians, they
         couldn't  spell  (in the  orthographic sense;  no  one has  yet accused
         Dianics  of inability to work magick), etc.  etc.  When I came together
         with  my covensisters,  I  realized that  these  notions were  at  most
         partially true and some cases were patently false.

                   Ibelieve there are onlythree valid generalizationsthat can be
         made about Dianics:   1) We are all feminists.   2) We all look  to the
         Goddess(es)  far more  than to the  God(s).   3) We  are all eclectics.
         Note  well  that  there  are plenty  of  non-Dianic  feminist  Witches,
         non-Dianic   eclectics,    and    non-Dianics   who    are    primarily
         Goddess-oriented.    There are  also  doubtless a  good  many feminist,
         Goddess-oriented eclectics who do not choose to call themselves
         Dianic.   In  my own  case I  use the  "If it  quacks  like a  duck, it
         probably is  a duck" argument, as well as  the fact that my HPS learned
         the Craft as a Dianic and runs Dianic rituals.

                   Some of thestereotypical generalizations I can dismiss out of
         hand.   I don't know of a single Dianic who denies that men have souls.
         Even  Z Budapest doesn't  believe that piece  of tripe anymore!   It is
         true that  Dianism is particularly attractive to  separatists, and many
         separatists  actually hate  men.   Many  Dianics  are lesbians.    Some
         misspell words  like "woman", women", "egalitarian",  and "holistic" on
         purpose.   Not all fit these, however,  and I think that  Z Budapest in
         her younger, or spiritual bomb-throwing, days represents an extreme and
         a small minority.  There are a number of males involved in Dianism, and
         some of those are men [NB:  I use the terms "man" and
         "woman"  to indicate gender identity,  that is, how  one's heart, mind,
         and/or soul  are configured.   I  use "male"  and "female" to  indicate
         physical  sex, that is, how one's plumbing  is configured.  I hope this
         dispels confusion.].

                   Thealogical and magickalimbalance isnot soeasily dismissedand
         needs to be addressed further, as that is the most valid objection that
         thoughtful  Witches have to Dianism.  The apparent imbalance comes from
         the Dianic emphasis on Goddess-worship, often to the complete exclusion
         of God-worship.  This  upsets many Witches' sense of  polarity balance.
         The  resolution of this apparent imbalance lies in the consideration of
         other  polarities than  sexual and/or gender  as the  primary polarity.
         There  are  indeed  many other  polarities  to  consider:   true-false,
         life-death,   dark-light,    rational-mystical,   creation-destruction,
         order-chaos, and good-evil, to name but a few.
         One problem with  the masculine-feminine  polarity is that  there is  a
         strong tendency  to express all other  polarities in terms of  it.  The
         Chinese  were particularly  fond of  this, and  mapped  everything they
         liked into the  yang side, and everything they disliked  or feared into
         the yin side, the patriarchal no-accounts!  

                                                                             601

                   One thingI have discovered isthat if you lookhard enough, you
         can find  goddesses to  fit both  ends of most  polarities.   Some even
         occupy both ends simultaneously.  Inanna, my matron goddess,  is a good
         case in point.  She is the Sumerian goddess of love, war, wisdom (which
         she won  in a drinking bout!),  adventure, the heavens,  the earth, and
         even  of death (in the  guise of her dark aspect,  Ereshkigal).  A very
         busy lady indeed is Inanna.  At this point it 
         becomes  largely  a  matter  of  personal  preference  rather  than  of
         polarity, whether one chooses a god or a goddess to occupy a particular
         place in a ritual.  

                   NoDianic I know ofdenies the existence ofthe God.  Indeed, He
         gets  mentioned as the consort of the  Goddess with some frequency in Z
         Budapest's HOLY  BOOK OF WOMEN'S  MYSTERIES, which is close  a thing as
         there  is to a Dianic version of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows.  He is
         there, and  sometimes we will invoke  Him, when it is  appropriate.  He
         makes  His  own path,  and  we  follow our  own,  and  when they  cross
         naturally we honor Him  and do not avoid Him.  We also do not force the
         paths  to cross simply to lend an  artificial balance to a ritual where
         none is really needed.

                   Now that I have spilled agood deal of ink over what Dianismis
         not, I  should now say  a few words  about what it  is:  a  movement of
         feminist, eclectic, Goddess-oriented Witches.  

                   Feminism: This covers avast multitudeof virtues andsins.  Ido
         not  think the stereotypical radical lesbian separatist is as common as
         is believed.  Moderate to liberal feminism is probably far more common,
         even  among Dianics.  Certainly  my own coven  contains no separatists!
         There are too many nice  men out there, even though surveys  have shown
         that 70% or more of all  men are potential rapists.  The nice  ones are
         found among those who are not in that repulsive majority; you just have
         to look to find them.  One of  the places you might find such nice  men
         is in Dianic covens!  Some are  mixed groups, at least some of those of
         the branch founded by Morgan McFarland.  My 
         own is something  of a  mixed up  group, I suppose.   While  we do  not
         currently have  any men in the coven, two of  the three of us were born
         male and still have  original-equipment plumbing.  The Goddess  and our
         HPS accept us unreservedly as women.  

                   Eclecticism:  If there isone dictum of Z Budapest's thatbears
         repeating to everyone in the Craft, and which gets followed by many, it
         is  "When  in doubt,  invent."   Dianics  tend toward  creative ritual,
         drawing from any and all  possible sources.  I have yet to see a Dianic
         equivalent of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, nor do I ever hope to see
         one.  

                                                                             602

                   Goddess Orientation: I've discussed this at some length while
         talking about polarity.  There are some wags who have said that Dianics
         are nothing  but matriarchal monotheists.  I tell you three times:  The
         Dianic  Goddess is  NOT Jehovah  in drag!   The  Dianic Goddess  is NOT
         Jehovah in drag!   The Dianic Goddess is  NOT Jehovah in drag!   A much
         closer  analogy would be that Dianics have taken the Classical pantheon
         and reclaimed most of the roles.  This, too, is oversimplifying, but it
         is not nearly as wide of the mark as the usual
         criticism.  At some point  I may write up a long exegesis on the Dianic
         Goddess, but not here.  My own personal involvement with Her comes from
         a great feeling  of comfort I do not find elsewhere.   She feels right.
         I have  a great deal of difficulty accepting known rapists (most of the
         Olympian  males are  this, especially  Zeus, Hades,  and Pan!)  into my
         personal pantheon.  I also feel a personal vocation from the Mother; it
         is rather incongruous to me to embrace a male deity wholeheartedly when
         the Goddess comes to me and calls me Her daughter.  This  goes doubled,
         redoubled, in pentacles, and vulnerable for lovers of women.

                   Ihope thislittlediscussion ofDianism-in-a-Nuitshell hasproved
         enlightening to you.  It is not a path for everyone, but it is  a valid
         path for some, and in considering it I hope that you can now ignore the
         garbage that has been put forth in the past as "data" regarding it.
