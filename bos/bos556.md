                   THE SYBILLYNE TRADITION OF WICCA
                   by Virginia Stewart, M. Ed., TP.

         Our tradition is a moderate branch of Dianic Wicca, with
    an emphasis on equality, ecology and wo/men's mysteries. The
    tradition is open to women and men, over the age of 18, who
    have previously identified Wicca as their path.  Someone
    under legal age must be accompanied by a parent and will not
    be initiated until they are of legal age.
         (Yes, there is a catch: few people under 21 will have
    studied other religions enough to have narrowed it down this
    much; therefore, a person without this study must spend at
    least a year pursuing comparative religions before they will
    be accepted for training.)
         The subject matter that each student must master prior
    to initiation is wide-ranging and intended to strengthen
    knowledge and interest in a number of areas, as well as
    increase the student's desire to "get involved" in the
    ecological/political issues which are important to them as
    individuals.  This is not an exclusive tradition; one can be
    an initiate of other traditions and still participate.  We
    have closed rituals only when the participating members
    desire it.  Our initiation is open to initiates of other
    traditions (who would be asked to assist, no one gets to
    stand around.)
         Sybillynes do not have degrees, unlike Gardnerians; we
    have three stages.  The Novice (or WIT, coined by one student
    -- it means "Witch in Training") is one who is actively
    studying, but has not yet been initiated.  A Sister or
    Brother has been initiated and holds the title of Priestess
    or Priest (there is no High Priestess or High Priest.)  The
    Chronicler is the one in the Coven or Circle who assumes the
    responsibility for making phone calls and keeping the Book of
    Shadows, but the position carries no authority.
         All decisions are reached by consensus, and the rituals
    are written and performed by various members of the group on
    a voluntary basis (it works, it really does).  After a long
    period of study, in which one might specialize in a
    2447

    particular area, one is Ordained as a Priestess or Priest in
    that area; for example, one might be a Teaching Priest/ess,
    or a Healing Priest/ess.
         To become a Novice, one must ask to be taught, then show
    a sincere interest in the Craft and a willingness to study
    and learn about the various areas presented.  One must also
    exhibit a willingness to do independent study in areas of
    personal interest.
         The Course of study is presented in two parts.  The
    first is lecture/discussion/reading -- after which the novice
    must demonstrate knowledge and understanding in the following
    areas:
    I.   Feminism and politics of Dianic craft
         A.   Gaia and green magic
         B.   balance of Male/female energies
         C.   power over vs. power from within
    II.  Feminist herstory/facts and theory
         A.   Origins of the Goddess
              1.   prehistoric evidence
              2.   early myth (China, Sumer, Ur, India,
                   Mesopotania, Egypt, Crete)
              3.   The patriarchal shift --
                   a.   Theories on how it happened
                   b.   How to read around it
                        i.   Greek Myth
                        ii.  Mesopotamia/Sumer
                        iii. Egypt
                   c.   Modern Approaches -- overcoming
                        patriarchal repression
                   d.   The God in Dianic Wicca
                        i.   prehistory evidence/belief
                        ii.  Modern approaches
    III. Feminist interpretations on the origins of people
         A.   creation Myths -- world samples
         B.   "star" myth
         C.   birth/genetic engineering myth
         D.   the principles of myth writing
    IV.  Goddess and Gods in Every Person
         A.   Manifesting the God/dess in Everyday Life -- theory
         B.   Archetypal Theory and how it relates to everyday
              life
    V.   Magic and Physics -- Why Everything is Related To
         Everything
         A.   Holographic Universe
         B.   Gaia as a Living Being
    VI.  The Goddess and Sexuality
         A.   Living in our bodies is healthy
         B.   how patriarchy/Christianity perverted sex
         C.   healing the wounds of sexual oppression
         D.   exercises
    VII. Beginning Meditation
         A.   purpose
         B.   some eventual goals
         C.   visualization
         D.   exercises

         B.   What to do if something goes wrong
         C.   Group dynamics

         Our actual reading list is two double-columned pages,
    and takes about a year to get through.  This is the short
    list, with which one must show a working knowledge.

    The Spiral Dance
    Dreaming the Dark
    Truth or Dare /  Starhawk
    Holy Book of Women's Mysteries / Z. Budapest
    The Holographic Universe / Michael Talbot
    The New Inquisition / Robert Anton Wilson
    Real Magic / Issac Bonewits
    When God Was A Woman
    Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood / Merlin Stone
    Priestesses / Norma Goodrich
    Women's Encyclopedia of Sacred Symbols and
    Objects / Barbara Walker
    Drawing Down the Moon / Margot Adler
    Iron John / Robert Bly
    The Hero with A Thousand Faces / Joseph Campbell

         The second part of training focuses on ritual and
    practice, as no one will be initiated until s/he can write,
    perform and understand ritual; work with energy in a SAFE
    way, and guide meditations for the others.  The following are
    the requirements for this level of training, in which one
    must demonstrate proficiency.

    1.   Circle Drawing
    2.   Healing (different types)
    3.   Energy Work

    4.   Journey to Lower World (working with totems)
    5.   Astral Realms (working with place of power and spirit
         guides)
    6.   9 Inner Planes
    7.   Past Life Regression
    8.   Elements, Tools, and Aspects
    2449

    9.   Women's Mysteries/Men's Mysteries (5 Mysteries)
    10.  Blessing of Tools
    11.  Personal Belief Systems
    12.  Spells and Spellwork
    13.  Full Ritual (writing and performing without assistance)

    Written assignments

    1. A 4-10 page paper explaining and analyzing the Wiccan Rede
    and how it applies to one's personal life (Ethics are vital)

    2. A 5-10 page paper explaining one's personal belief system
    (it does not conform to any particular standard, but an
    initiate must have one; this is a spiritual tradition).

    3. A 5-10 page paper explaining and analyzing the 5 Mysteries
    of Wicca with particular attention paid to Wo/man's
    mysteries, Chalice and the Descent.

    4. A 2-5 page paper explaining the Three-Fold Goddess and Her
    Relationship to the Three-Fold God.

    5. A 5-10 page paper describing one's personal ethics

    6. A Book of Shadows (to be reviewed by Teaching Priestess)
    that includes major rituals, meditations, observations and
    results of spell work and energy work.

         The final requirement for initiation includes the
    demonstration of Ritual functions of Maiden/Mother/Crone or
    Priest without written assistance; the demonstration of
    ritual writing and participation in/ directing the energy in
    a circle.  Finally, the demonstration through daily life of a
    sincere commitment to the Way of the God/dess.
         The training period lasts anywhere from twenty-six weeks
    to over a year and is dependent on the completion of
    requirements, not number of months in training.
         A Novice (WIT) will be told that they may request
    Initiation when they have completed all requirements to the
    satisfaction of the Teaching Priestess.  They will be told
    once, after that they must ask.  Sybillynes do NOT recruit
    members.
         After Initiation, a Priest/ess may form a Circle (a
    loosely organized group that performs ritual together) or a
    Coven (a close-knit group with bonds of perfect love and
    trust).  It is suggested that Circles be formed and allowed
    to evolve into Covens.
         All Initiates are encouraged to become politically/
    ecologically active to whatever degree that they are able.
    Each group exists as an independent organization -- the job
    of a Teaching Priestess is to make herself unnecessary.
    Those who desire control over a coven or absolute authority
    within a coven are discouraged from attempting it within this
    tradition -- the labrys, our symbol, is sharp for a reason...
         We are also interested in tradition sharing, and can be
    found in the Hunter's Moon camp at CMA.  Inquires can be made
    by leaving a message at Celebration! in Austin, or at the
    Magic Cauldron in Houston, for Virginia Stewart or Howard
    2450

    Gerber (sysop of THE WHEEL BBS in Houston).
         Merry Meet and Bright Blessings.
