                                  THE PAGAN UNITY RITUAL

          For group workings: we have generally made this the first part of our
          meeting, after the erection and consecration of our working space. The
          music used for the working is &quot;The Burning Times&quot; by Charlie Murphy.
          Love it or loath it, this song is undeniably the anthem of the Neo-Pa-
          gan movement, and is played or sung at Pagan gatherings in Britain,
          Europe, Scandinavia, the USA and Canada. By using it for this working,
          we are making a very profound connection with the world's Pagan commu-
          nity. 


          First form a cartwheel with your cords - loop them over each other,
          and hold the loose ends. Then stand in a circle, with the cords f-
          orming the spokes of the &quot;cartwheel&quot;. Start the music, and as the dr-
          umming begins, so everyone slowly moves deosil in time to its beat. As
          you dance, you remember all the Pagans you have ever known, or worked
          with. If you don't know many, then think about Pagans who have in-
          fluenced or inspired you - writers, singers, poets, artists - it
          doesn't matter which, as long as you remember them. Throughout the
          song, continue to dance, and continue to remember: focus upon the
          image of the cords as a web which joins all Pagans together.

          In our groups, we generally end the dance after &quot;The Burning Times&quot; f-
          inishes with an &quot;Eko Eko...&quot; chorus, and then drop the cords to the
          ground to send the magic on its way. If you work alone, the ritual can
          be adapted. Instead of forming a cartwheel, you can weave your cords
          into a web-like pattern, or use knots - it doesn't matter which, as
          long as you remember, and focus upon the concept of the links with ot-
          her Pagans. If Australian readers have problems finding a copy of &quot;The
          Burning Times&quot;, write to us, and we'll try and put you in touch with a
          supplier.

          This ritual has now been performed a number of times with Pagans from
          NSW, ACT, SA and the USA. It is also being worked in Britain, and a
          number of events that have happened recently seem to confirm that a
          very real current is being generated to strengthen Pagan Unity.
