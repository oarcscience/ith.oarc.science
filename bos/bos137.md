                                        DIVINATION 
                 This seems like a fairly good time of year to be talking
         about divination.  What is it, why do we do it, and what's in it
         for us?  Lots of people think it's a way of avoiding
         responsibility - if the future is preordained, we might as well
         go back to bed.

                 Of course, that's not it at all.  Divination is the use of
         any one of several methods to obtain information which is not
         directly accessible to the conscious mind of the person asking
         the question.  Whether you use cards, crystals, a pendulum, ink,
         lead, dice, the flight of birds or anything else, what you are
         really doing is opening your end of a channel to higher wisdom. 
         I consider the "actual" source of that wisdom irrelevant and
         immaterial; it could be one's own subconscious, the collective
         unconscious, the Gods' will, telepathic insight, or a big
         computer buried in the Balkans.  It's still additional
         information which is not as tainted by ego and intellect's
         limitations as most.

                 So what do we do with it?  The same things we do with any
         other information; add it to what we already know and develop a
         synthesis that can help us do our decision-making.  The easiest
         way to analyze the process is with a concrete (well, maybe jello)
         example:

                 A young man has been between relationships for some time. 
         He wants very much to link up with the great love of his life,
         but is not aware of anyone on the horizon.  He is putting himself
         in a position to meet new people, presenting himself as
         attractively as he can, and generally taking care of business,
         but no results.  He has to decide whether to take a work-related
         course at night or not.  It will take a lot of time and there are
         not likely to be any women attending.  His progressed horoscope
         is neutral.  He gets his cards read.  They say:
         [PAUSE]       
         1.Nothing at all about love, but a lot about skilled craftsman-
         ship and satisfaction through work.  He decides to relax and wait
         for a better time, takes the course, and is rewarded with a
         modest promotion which enhances his satisfaction with his job.

         2.A lot about increasing social activities, leading to the start
         of a new romance, leading to great happiness and satisfaction
         after some difficulties are resolved.  He does not take the
         course, and meets a really nice interesting lady at a party given
         by a friend (which he couldn't have attended had he taken the
         course).

                                                                             604

         3.That he is overlooking sources of emotional gratification in
         his current situation.  Given the information, he starts looking
         around and discovers that one of his quieter friends is a really
         thoughtful and insightful person who helps him learn to know
         himself better, and that a young cousin needs a mentor and this
         relationship gives him a lot of pleasure and fulfillment.  He
         begins to feel much more ready for a good relationship, and much
         less impatient to have one start.

                 These examples illustrate the point made above; divination
         provides you with choices, and you take the consequences, no
         matter what the oracles say.  Treat them with respect, not
         adoration or blind compliance, and may they always show you the
         truth.

         Blessed Be,
         The Spinster Aunt  ...from RMPJ 12/86

                                                                             605
