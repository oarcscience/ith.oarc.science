<P><BLOCKQUOTE><TT><CENTER>Second Degree Initiation</CENTER><BR>This is a ceremony we have 
used a couple of times (with variations to suit the candidate) for the second degree initiation. 
You will note that it borrows from many sources: Masonic, Gardnerian, Celtic and Flight of 
Fancy. We've done it robed, skyclad and some interesting combinations. Seems to work OK either 
way. If the candidate has done the work, the initiation ceremony is more of a public &quot;rite 
of passage&quot; or recognition of that fact... the real &quot;initiation&quot; is between the 
Gods and the candidate, and therefore cannot really be &quot;conferred&quot;.<BR>...Gary 
Dumbauld, High Priest, Hernesgaard Circle</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A ceremony to recognize completion<BR>of the 2nd degree course of study</H1>

<P>The Circle is cast as usual. All are properly prepared and purified. High Priestess and High 
Priest perform the Ceremony in concert. The candidate is brought into the circle by a friend and 
circled 3 times deosil, ending north of the altar, facing the Priest, who is standing south of 
the altar (where else?).</P>

<P>PRIEST:<BR>&quot;This is the time of Full Moon, a time for rekindling of light. The struggle 
for higher light is: That we may see it, and seeing it, work and live by it. We are about to 
embark upon a solemn ceremony to rekindle the light of Knowledge, the light of Will, the light 
of Compassion, the light of Steadfastness; we will combine these lights, and rekindle the light 
of Dedication in our Sister (Brother) here before us.<BR>______________, here have you been 
taught the ways of the Wise, that you might count yourself among those who serve the Gods, among 
the brothers and sisters of the Wicca, those who are called the shapers of the universe.&quot;</P>

<P>PRIEST:<BR>&quot;I now direct your attention to the two lights upon our altar, the one 
representing the Sun, the God, and the High Priest; the other representing the Moon, the 
Goddess, and the High Priestess. The High Priest and Priestess, presiding over the coven, may be 
thought of as 'One light to rule the day, one light to rule the night'. Since these lights are 
both beneficent, each having honor in its place, the Craft of the Wise does not set day against 
night, God against Goddess, Priest against Priestess. In the Craft, we do not define evil as a 
negative power, rather as the lack of light; where there is the light of Sun or Moon, God or 
Goddess, there can be no lack of light. Choose one, or both; place light within yourself, and 
nurture it.&quot;<BR>&quot;In times past, the Circle of Initiation was called a 'Hermetic 
Circle', after Hermes, the ancient name for the planet Mercury.&quot; In astrology, the house of 
the Sun is in the zodiacal sign of the lion, which is the fifth house; the house of the Moon is 
in Cancer, the crab, and is in the fourth house; and the day house of the planet Mercury is in 
the Gemini, the Twins, and is the third house. These numbers, three, four and five, were sacred 
to many ancient peoples, as the dimensions of the Pythagorean Triangle, in which the square of 
five, twenty five, is equal to the sum of the squares of four and three, or sixteen and nine. 
Knowledge of this triangle was essential to builders; you are also a builder-you are building 
your character.&quot;</P>

<P>PRIESTESS:<BR>&quot;I now direct your attention to the several lights surrounding us, in the 
East, South, West, and North. Let us now examine these lights, and see what we can discern 
within them of human character.&quot;<BR>&quot;In the building of character, the Eastern light is 
denoted the Lamp of Beauty, and stands for accomplishments; for learning, skill in art, poetry, 
in song and instrumental music, in painting and sculpture. It exemplifies the art of making 
one's self attractive to those about one. It is an old saying that 'Beauty is as Beauty does'. 
It causes great distress to see these noble graces of character prostituted to ignoble ends. 
Remember well the lesson of the Lamp of Beauty and accept the blessing of the East.&quot;</P>

<P>Initiate is censed with incense from the censer which has been previously placed in the East.</P>

<P>PRIEST:<BR>&quot;The light in the South is denoted the Lamp of Life, and stands for 
individuality, and for energy; for fervency, for zeal and vitality. It exemplifies passions, 
desires and appetites. It means loves and hates, sympathies and abhorrences, and what is more 
than all the rest of these, it means heart and joy in the work of life. Remember well the lesson 
of the Lamp of Life and accept the blessing of the South.&quot;</P>

<P>Initiate is circled three times with the brazier, previously placed in the South.</P>

<P>PRIESTESS:<BR>&quot;Look now to the West, and observe the Lamp of Compassion, which stands 
for 'fellow-feeling'. Every work in life demands a price. Labor, tears, self-denial, 
self-recrimination, the very blood of life is sometimes the price of a truly great work. Look to 
your fellow travellers on the road; note with care what sacrifice they have made in their 
progress toward the truth; allow them their faults, commiserate with them in their failures and 
rejoice with them when they succeed. Remember well the lesson of the Lamp of Compassion and 
accept the blessing of the West.&quot;</P>

<P>Initiate is circled three times with water and his/her hands washed in a laving bowl, 
previously placed in the West.</P>

<P>PRIEST:<BR>&quot;Look now to the North, and observe the lamp of obedience. The laws of the 
Gods are inevitable, and the more we, as children of the Gods, understand and work in accordance 
with them, the greater is the sum of our happiness. Obedience in character means order, the 
subjection to one's principles, the fear to do wrong, and the desire to learn and do right. Many 
would rather give charity than do justice. They swell with emotion, weep with sentiment, howl 
with the mob, so long as their own particular little tyranny or injustice is not touched. The 
Lamp of Obedience exemplifies firm will and determination of character, in spite of difficulties,
dangers and losses. So also the Lamp of Obedience stands for self-control, perseverance and 
prudence. In time of peace, prepare for war; when shines the sun, expect the cloud; and in 
darkness wait patiently for the coming light. 'When all the sky is draped in black and beaten by 
tempestuous gales, and the shuddering ship seems all awreck, calmly trim once more the tattered 
sail, repair the broken rudder and set again for the old determined course.' Remember well the 
lesson of the Lamp of Obedience and accept now the blessing of the North.&quot;</P>

<P>Initiate's hands are marked with damp earth from a bowl in the North. Initiate is then led 
back south of the altar.</P>

<P>PRIESTESS:<BR>&quot;Of the character thus illuminated and thus guided by the lights here on 
the altar, and by the Lamps of Beauty, Life, Compassion and Obedience, it may be said, 'Though 
the world perish and fall away, he/she remains.&quot;</P>

<P>Initiate then takes the Oath/Obligation, kneeling.</P>

<P>&quot;In the names of Arianhrod and Bran; Diana and Appolyon; Heartha and Cernunnos; and by 
the powers of Earth, Air, Fire and Water, I, __________________, pledge to love, worship and 
honor the Goddess in her many aspects; and her Consort, the Horned One, Lord of Death and Ruler 
of Chaos; to always be true to the Art and its secrets; to never abuse the Art or my own powers; 
and to keep this pledge always in my heart, in my mind, in my body and in my spirit. This I 
pledge, by the Circle of Life, by Cerridwen's Sacred Cauldron and by my own hopes of a future 
life.&quot;</P>

<P>Initiate stands. High Priestess places a necklace over Initiate's head.</P>

<P>PRIESTESS:<BR>&quot;The Circle is a place between the worlds and outside time. The Circle is 
also the Symbol of Life, Death and Rebirth. We wear the necklace as a token of the Sacred Circle 
and as a sign that we are part of all it symbolizes.&quot;</P>

<P>High Priest strikes the bell three times.</P>

<P>PRIEST:<BR>&quot;Hear ye, Lady of Life and Lord of Death! Hear ye, Ancient Guardians of the 
Powers of Air, Fire, Water and Earth! In this place, by our hands and will, ___________________, 
known to us as _______________, has been duly pledged and anointed a Priest/ess of the Second 
Degree!&quot;</P>
