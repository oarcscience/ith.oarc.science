# Samhain Notes

The High Priestess wears her white tabard if she has one for the opening
ritual, with the veil thrown back.

After the Witches' Rune, the High Priest and High Priestess take up
their athames. He stands with his back to the altar, she faces him
across the cauldron, They then simultaneously draw the Invoking
Pentagram of Earth in the air with their athames towards each other,
after which they lay down their athames; he on the altar, she by the
cauldron.

The High Priestess scatters incense on the charcoal in the cauldron.
When she is satisfied that it is burning, she stands still facing the
High Priest across the cauldron. She then declaims (if needed, ask a man
to bring one of the altar candles and hold it for her):

The High Priestess then walks around the cauldron and gives the High
Priest the Five-fold Kiss.

She returns to her place and pulls the veil of her tabard over her face.
She then calls on each woman, by name to come forward and give the High
Priest the Five Fold Kiss.

When they have all done so, the coven forms up around the circle,
alternating male and female with the Maiden next to the West candle. As
soon as they are in place, the High Priestess says:

The Maiden should spiral into the center, taking three or four circuits
to do so. During this time, the coven should maintain absolute silence
and concentrate on welcoming their dead friends.

When she reaches the center, she faces the High Priestess across the
cauldron. They touch palms and the High Priestess says:

The women break contact and the Maiden returns to the West candle. When
she is there, the High Priestess says:

Everyone moves in and sits in a close ring around the cauldron. The High
Priestess renews the incense. Now is the time for communion with the
dead. When finished scrying, the cauldron is placed next to the East
candle.

The spirits of the dead must be thanked and released. The High Priestess
leads the rest of the Coven in saying:

The next thing to do is the Great Rite in some form.
