                                      ANOTHER ONE FOR JIM MORRISON 
                  
                 Where did he go, that vision-mad soul? 
                 What did he see on his quest? 
                 Who did he meet at the end of his night? 
                 Why did he fail the test? 
                  
                 The shaman is old, a new must be found, 
                 Take the young ones to a height. 
                 Those who would be a shaman must jump. 
                 The one who survives will be right. 
                  
                 He jumped--the serpent-strength filled his soul. 
                 He jumped--the new lizard king. 
                 He jumped--to the Lady he feared would be there. 
                 He jumped--but rose not to take wing. 
                  
                 And I would now follow that worthy's descent, 
                 I would dare Medicine's dive. 
                 For I love the path he blazed for us all, 
                 But I, unlike him, shall survive. 
                  
                 I jump--the snakes I feared buoy my soul. 
                 I jump--my spirit now sings. 
                 I jump--to the Lady I know will be there. 
                 I jump--can it be I've grown wings?
