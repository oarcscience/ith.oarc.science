                                    The Charge of The God
                                    (c) 1986, Kyri Comyn

                   "I am the strength of the rock at thy back, the roots of the
              tree that anchor the Earth and deepest of tides in the black
              depths of the ocean.  I am the Hunter and the Sacred Prey, the
              warmth of the sun in the swelling grapes and the call of the road
              that leads over the hill.

                   I give you, my creatures, the fire of love, the power of the
              wind on your face, shelter from the darkest storm.  You are dear
              to me, and I instill in you my power...the power of peace hard
              earned, the power of vision and magical sight, and the spark of
              elemental fire, which is the primal light in the darkness.

                   By the powers of running stag and glorious sun, I charge
              thee;  by the darkest depth of night and the lingering tendrils
              of dreams, I charge thee; and by the beauty of your own creation,
              I charge thee;

                   Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead
                   you.  The wealth of the heart will guide you where the
                   cold edge of logic cannot take you.

                   Take joy in the powers of your bodies.  The form your
                   body takes is unique in the universe and is chief among
                   your tools.

                   Lastly, always remember the path you have left behind
                   you.  Learn to take your power from the foolish things
                   you have wrought as well as the good you have done for
                   others and for your world.  You can never usurp
                   another's power, and yours is the well upon which you
                   must rely.

                   I am with you always, just over your shoulder, running with
              you through the tall grasses and forests that surround you.  I
              possess you and I am your Sacred Prey.  I am the Lord of Death,
              and when you have come to the end of your life on this world, I
              will be there; to take you between the worlds, to offer you peace
              and rest.  Look upon my face; know me.  I am the spirit of the
              wild things, but you too, are wild in your souls and we are
              forever intertwined."
