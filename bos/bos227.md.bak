                         Helpful Hints for a Nearly Extinct Species
                              Submitted satirically by Haragano

              Let's get down  to basics.  Being the  leader of a group is  more than
              just  the hard work of raising dust devils in the back yard or zapping
              a  friend's TV antenna so they can get  HBO.  Leading a group offers a
              lot of perks.  You get  a lot  of ego strokes,  you get  to divide  up
              babies just like Solomon and  you even get to keep the  leftovers from
              the potlucks at moon feasts.  After all you have put in a lot of long,
              hard hours and cashed in a lot of empties to win the coveted  title of
              "High Poop-di  Ha of the Infinite Invisibility".  And you want to keep
              it!  The bottom line, the final  word in keeping your position on  top
              of the  heap is spelled  P-O-W-E-R.   These hints  are concerned  with
              helping you keep it.

                    In the busy modern craft of  today there are many ways that your
              power base can be  erroded.  The two most  likely ways you can  end up
              preaching to an empty circle are through the insiduous inroads made by
              INFORMATION  and DISCUSSION.  These  twin curses have  upset more High
              Poop-di-Has than Carter has little liver pills.

                  Information is the worst threat. The more a follower is acquainted
              with history, anthropology, psychology, socio-dynamics ... really, any
              area that requires an individual to exert himself mentally, you are in
              for questions  you don't really want  to answer. The very  best way to
              deal with  this sticky situation is to avoid it.  Recruit the immature
              and the fanatic.  They don't bring really tasty goodies to feasts, but
              they are  good ego boosters.   They are expendable and  feircely loyal
              for no particular reason.

                  If  you find you are being pestered by an "intellect" (they should
              have never gotten through your screening) you have to quickly learn to
              manage  information   more  effectively.    Don't   worry.    Managing
              information is easier than  it seems.  Newscasters do it  every night.
              First, Adopt  an attitude of  "ask me  anything", then  make sure  you
              don't have  any answers and  don't know where  to get them.   Create a
              vacuum!  Yes,  nature abhors a vacuum but it  is your strongest weapon
              in the war for ignorance.  Second is the wild  goose chase, atried and
              true method of dealing  with anyone who persists in  asking questions.
              Send a troublesome individual  on a few of these.   Tire them out, and
              they will go away sooner or later.  When they leave,  the stage is set
              for you to shake your head solemnly and expound at length on how they
              were not  ready to  learn what you  had to  offer.   This act is  very
              impressive to newcomers.

                Reassure your followers that they don't have to keep up on current
              thoughts in  and  about the  craft.   After  all,  books and  magazine
              subscriptions are expensive.  Imply that they will learn all that they
              need from you by hinting at the "secrets of the craft" that yet  await
              them.  If they are adamant about reading, call their attention only to
              those items that reinforce your point of view (you need all the backup
              you can get).  The Xian  (as in Xmas)  fundamentalists have  developed
              this  sort of information management  into an art  form.  "Information
              Management  is next  to  Godilness". I'm  sure  Mr. Falwell  has  that
              embroidered on a  pillow slip somewhere.  You might  want to write him
              for a needlepoint kit.
               


                                                                                 967
              


              ON TO DISCUSSION...
                  Discussion  with other groups must be limited. If they don't share
              your point of view, all contact with them should be eliminated.  After
              all,  your immature followers do mature and  fanatics mellow out.  The
              free exchange of  differing ideas has  a justifiablely bad  reputation
              for expanding an individuals craft  viewpoint.  And THAT is deadly  to
              the sacred position of High Poop-di Ha.

                There is an effective means of terminating troublesome contacts with
              other groups, while  at the same time confirming your  position as the
              center  of attention.    It  is  the  practice of  the  "Fine  Art  of
              Self-Righteous Indignation"!   The  premier example  of  this was  the
              medieval  Church.   When it  met with  a conflicting  view, such  as a
              scholar pointing out that the Church was rewriting history or physics,
              the Church  would denounce him  as a "minion  of Satan".   Usually the
              scholar was hauled off and put to the
              Question.   What's  the truth,  more  or less,  compared to  the  self
              Righeous
              Indignation of God's Chosen....right?
                  Remember, you haveto slam the door tightly on any new ideas!  This
              takes  dramatic  measures.   You  don't  want conflicting  information
              coming  in, and  you certainly  don't want  your s/h/e/e/p/  followers
              wandering off.

                  Pick a public occasion and  invade a circle or burst into  a study
              group.   Most importantly, make sure your  group is around you.  After
              all, the  coming performance  is really  for them.   Rant,  pound your
              breast, whatever you need to  do, to get across the idea of YOU as the
              poor, persecuted victim.   Make this  crystal clear to your  group and
              they will stick to you like you were dipped in crazy glue.   If anyone
              in your group  has ever had a course in group dynamics, send them on a
              wild  goose chase that evening.  They might  tumble to what you are up
              to, and besides they are probably asking too many questions anyway.

                  When  facing the  m/i/n/i/o/n/s/o/f/S/a/t/a/n/ opposing  group, be
              personally  offensive  if  you  can.    Call  them  picky,  heretical,
              egotistical, perverse, etc.   Anything you can get away  with (wailing
              in  the background is a nice touch).   To keep your group successfully
              insulated  from  differing  ideas,  you  have  to  clearly  label  the
              opposition  in the  minds of  your followers.  People just  LOVE tags!
              Now, this next point is important, so listen up!  You must make it 
              clear that you  want no further contact with the  opposing group.  Try
              to  affect a tone  in your voice  that conveys "this  is a regrettable
              decision but it just  has to be", like the tone  Billy Graham takes on
              when he talks about sinners.  This gives you a twofold  bonus.  First,
              it gets the  word to "them" in no uncertain terms and, second, it gets
              the word to your people that it would not be wise for anyone who wants
              to remain a part  of your group to have  any contact with "those"  you
              have just judged unacceptable.  This sort of frontal assault generally
              alienates both groups as well as every individual  in them. There will
              be no information exchange, no open discussion and very little growth.
              But what do you care, you're safe.


                                                                                 968
              



                One warning though; If for any reason you think the other group will
              simply  laugh   at  your  overacting,  don't   chance  a  face-to-face
              confrontation.  Keep the  performance within your own  group.  If  you
              have been a good information manager that should be effective enough.

                Although you are one of the last "High Poop-di-Ha's of the Infinite 
              Invisibility"  in the craft, you belong to an ancient society that can
              be traced through  most of the world's major religions.  You exemplify
              rigidity, closed-mindedness  and religious  manipulation.  You  have a
              lot to  be self-righteous about!   In order to pervent  your kind from
              dying out completely, you have to remember to stringently restrict the
              information flow to your group and terminate all open discussions with
              outsiders  holding differing  views.  If  you take to  heart these few
              pointers  you won't  go the  way of  the Great  Auk and  the Passenger
              Pigeon.


                                                                                                                                                            
                  


                                                                                 969
