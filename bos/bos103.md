              Subj: Ethics in Magick



              A local group recently sponsored a  seminar on the ethics of magick. I
              was unable  to attend  but  heard the  tapes of  the session.  Several
              people on this  echo were present and  had thoughtful things to say as
              did the  others in attendance.   I would  like to address  a few ideas
              that came up there and, of course, are  significant to all people that
              work magick.

              The  question  of  hexing came  up.  A  rousing  chorus ensued  saying
              essentially  that many folks  there felt their own ethical  model does
              not allow hexing. Initially, I put myself in that group as well.  I am
              not a  bad person, I  do not  intentionally hurt people.   After  some
              thought, though, I asked myself this question.

              If there  is a conceivable ethical situation  where I might sucker    
              punch someone, why would there not be such a time to zap them with    
              the same magnitude of magick?

              If  I punch someone when  they have no known  defense against me, I am
              opening  the  serious potential to harm them. My  punch might not hurt
              them at all, it might surprise them more than hurt them, it might hurt
              them enough that they get the message I was sending, or it might blind
              or  even kill them. I would  not know until after the  fact. If I felt
              justified in punching them, I would probably do it. If they turned and
              destroyed  me, I  would  have  to  question my  judgement  afterwards.
              Likewise if I blinded them.

              Acceptance of the karmic debt was raised as part of this justification
              cycle. By going ahead and hitting them, I tacitly or implicitly accept
              the debt.  Personal destruction or  harming the other  guy, it  is the
              same, I accept the debt by my action.

              Now where is the ethical question here?

              I have  often done things, things  as simple as saying  something in a
              certain way, that I immediately want to retract. If I hit this fellow,
              I probably  would want to take it back afterward. Is it ethical to act
              in a  fashion that given a  little thought you would  realize you will
              regret later?

              Magick works  in the same  way. Presuming the  ability to  control the
              magickal  zap to  the  relative intensity  of  the sucker  punch,  the
              results are just as unknown. So you accept the karmic debt, so you zap
              away.

              "Do what ye will" as long  as you accept the debt makes it  ethical? I
              don't think  so, I think  it is in  fact unethical to  hit or  zap the
              person. But I  might do it anyway. It is not really so much a question
              of ethics as it is a question of responsibility.

                                                                                 415

              No doubt Ollie North thinks that it is unethical to break the law. But
              he  did. No doubt  Jim Wright takes  the ethics of  public office very
              seriously,  but he is now in deep  refritos over an ethical dilemma of
              his own making.

              Shit Happens.  (For those of  you with  new babies, Doo  Doo Happens.)
              Ethics is a  model of what we would like in  the ideal.  That ideal we
              measure ourselves against. We can parade case examples all day to test
              this  conclusion but it is still unethical  to harm another. But we do
              it, both physically and magickly.

              So,   ethical  hexing,   there   is  no   such   thing.  I   caste   a
              hurt-you-this-much zap  on the intended, I have acted unethically. "An
              ye  harm none."  No disclaimer  or release  for special  situations is
              given or implied. She will see me break this, karma will see  that the
              ripples in  the pool come back  to me. All  together, She will  see me
              take responsibility, ethics be damned.

              One more  time, the chorus swells  and this time  I am sure that  I am
              part of that group. There is no ethical justification for hexing. Just
              don't piss me  off though, I might  be willing to  take responsibility
              for my actions.

              Bambi died for us, kicking and screaming in torment!
