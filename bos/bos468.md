                                     The Sacred King 
            The Men and Women were hungry. They would eat of those that walk in 
    Fur, Fin and Feather, and thank them for their sacrifice, but that was not 
    enough. They would eat of the wild fruits of the Earth, but that was not 
    enough, for all of these must be found, and hunted, and a home cannot be 
    built on this. 
            And the Sacred King saw, and thought upon it for a time, and His face 
    grew grave and sad.
            And He spoke to the Lady, and said, "I must die."
            And the Lady grieved for Her Lord, and He fell upon His Sword, and 
    died. 
            The Mother buried Him in the Earth, returning Him to Her Womb, and 
    mourned, and Winter wrapped the World in ice and snow.
            She covered the face of the Sky with dark clouds, and Her Tears of 
    rain poured therefrom in cascades and torrents. 
            And the Tears of the Mother wetted the ground, and the Sun warmed the 
    ground, and a green shoot appeared, poking its head out from the Womb of the 
    Mother, and grew as the days grew, longer and taller, until the golden hair 
    of the Sacred King once more waved proudly in the wind; until the Grain of 
    the Fields stood, row upon row, as far as the eye could see; until the Bounty 
    of the Mother, the Sacred King Himself, stood upon the World, ready to be 
    harvested. 

            "That was well done," said the Mother, "But it pains me to see you 
    die." 
            "It is as it must be," He said, "And does it not show them that Death 
    is an illusion; is but another change in a MultiVerse of Change? It feeds 
    them, too, and this is a good thing." 
            "You are right," She sighed, "But I just wish it could have been done 
    in a kinder way." 
            "Maybe," He spoke, lowly, "But it is as it is nonetheless."

            Thus it was, and so it is, and evermore shall be so!



                                                                                2204
