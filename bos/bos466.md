                                   HANDFASTING RITUAL
                              FROM LADY ARDANE, ON PRODIGY

    Our tradition (Fam. Trad.) uses a lovely ceremony I will post here. You may use
    any or all of it that pleases you.

    Our bride wears white with red Witches cord at waist, groom wears
    red with white Witches cord.There is a procession led by the High
    Priestess bearing the wand,and the High Priest carrying the
    bells.The bride and groom are escorted by two pages. At altar the
    Hps.lights candles (red & white) and Incense (Rose &
    Frankincense). After charging the circle the Highpriestess who
    officiates says: We gather here this Night (day) to bind together
    this man and woman in a ritual of love. Let all who stand within
    this circle be here of their own free will and accord in peace
    and love.We charge this Circle to be filled with love. May this
    sacred space be consecrated before the Gods and Goddesses and may
    it be a Guardian and Protection for the work we do this night
    (day). Let (name)and(name) stand here before us and in the
    Presence of the Ancient Ones.

    Hps goes to the East: Be with us here oh Spirits of the Air With
    your breath of life, join the bonds between these two and tie
    them tightly.

    South: Be with us here oh Beings of Fire. Give their love and
    passion your own all consuming ardor.

    West: Be with us here of Beings of Water. Grant these two the
    deepest of love richness of body, soul and spirit.

    North: Be with us here, oh Spirits of Earth, Let your strength
    and constancy be theirs for as long as they desire to be
    together.

    Blessed Godddess and Laughing God, look with joy on this Union of
    this man and this woman. Grant them harmony and beauty in their
    lives and let them be always mindful of their committment, one to
    the other.  Let them so live together that their joy of each
    other will be a shining beacon for all to see. Give to these two
    your love and protection. SMIB.

    The Priest and Priestess each hold an end of the wand and place
    the rings on it. The B&G each place their right hand over the
    rings on the wand. The Hps says:Above you the Stars Below you the
    stones,As time passes remember this; Like a stone your love
    should be firm, Be close, yet not so close that you restrict one
    another. Possess one another yet grant each other freedom to
    grow. Be understanding and compassionate. Have patience with each
    other, for storms may come, but they will quickly go.Be free in
    giving warmth and affection, make love often and be sensuous to
    one another. Fear not lest the ways or words of the unenlightened
    give you unease, for the God and Goddess are with you now and
    always. To the bride: Is it you wish to become one with this man?
    To the groom, Is it your wish to become one with this woman? Take



                                                                                2200

    the charged rings from the wand and hand them to each in turn. As
    they place the rings on each other they say: Let this circle of
    Gold reflect the circle in which we stand to be a constant
    reminder of the pledges exchanged. Let it remind us daily of the
    wheel of life and the unbroken cycles of eternity. The B & G
    drink out of the Chalice as the HPS says...As you share this cup
    this night(day) so may you share your lives and fortunes. The B&G
    remove their Witches cords and hand them to the HPs who asks the
    B&G to face each other and hold hands. She then binds their hands
    with the cords and says...As we bind together this man and this
    woman with these cords let their fates and future be so bound.
    May they hold fast to each other, even as they are now held
    fast. Hps removes cords and hands them to the pages. Hps says: As
    the God and Goddess and the Ancient Ones are witness to these
    rites I now proclaim you to be wed, one to the other. SMIB. (Here
    the B & G kiss).

    The HPS goes to each of the four corners dismissing the elements
    in turn by saying: We dismiss you now, Oh spirits of air
    (earth,fire,water,) and ask you to return to your elemental home
    harming none as you go  and taking with you our thanks for your
    attendance.

    And then at altar,: Dear Lady, Mother of us all,Blessed Lord of
    the Woodland.. We thank you for your Attendance in our Sacred
    Circle and ask your blessings on this couple and on the work we
    have performed here this night (day). We dismiss you now to your
    areas of governance, harming none as you go and taking with you
    our thanks and love.

    As we unwind our circle we place before this newly bound couple
    our offerings of flowers to bring beauty to their lives and as
    they represent the God and Goddess this night (day) we ask their
    blessings on each of us. Merry meet and merry part and merry meet
    again. The circle unwinds from the North with each guest (circle
    member) kneeling before the B & G and placing fresh flowers
    before them.As they kneel the B & G touches each person on the
    forehead. The guests leave the altar area after this followed by
    the B & G, then the pages and finally the Hp & Hps.  
    I thought long and hard about posting this as a public message.
    But since I wrote it, (and plagarized some of it from various
    Pagan sources) and we have used it in our hand-fastings and have
    found it to be appropriate and moving, I think it may be
    something to be shared and enjoyed by others. Like all Pagan
    rituals, use only what seems appropriate to you. Rearrange it,
    re-write it or toss it out. It is, as I said, a Fam. Trad ritual.
    Lady Ardane.



                                                                                2201
