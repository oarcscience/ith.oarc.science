                            CANDLEMAS RITUAL

                             Mysts of Annwfn
                             Book of Shadows


         The following ritual calls for the participation of eight
    people, and is best performed at a large gathering.  The
    participants include:  The Maiden Goddess, the Young Lord, the
    High Priestess, the High Priest, and the four Watchtowers.

         Specific items needed for this ritual are:  a Crystal Ball,
    a cross of rushes, a mat, a basket, a phallic wand, a sprig of
    evergreen, pieces of paper, cakes, wine, and basic Altar and
    ritual equipment.  All participants shall write upon the paper
    things and qualities they wish to gain during the coming season,
    and then place them in the basket prior to ritual.

         Candlemas is the festival of the Flame, and is best
    performed at night.  This is Brighid's celebration.  Winter is
    bade farewell, and as Spring approaches, it's a time to think of
    love.

                            *   *   *   *   *

         All members of the ritual enter the Circle except for the
    Maiden.  She should be wearing white, and is adorned with a
    garland of flowers in her hair.  She stands out of sight,
    awaiting her cue.  All attendants of the ritual should line the
    outer ring of the Circle, leaving a walkway into it.  The Young
    Lord is to position himself among the attendants.

         The High Priest starts the ritual by saying:

         The young Sun King now begins to feel the first stirring of
    desire for the Lady.  The Goddess patiently awaits her future
    lover.  The Rites of Spring are near, and the year is in its
    waxing phase.  The Sun's presence is ever-more increasing and the
    darkness runs and hides.

         The Invocation of the Four Quarters comes next, starting
    with the East:

         We welcome the Guardians of the East.  Your breath of life
    is sacred, and greetings to the lovely Fand, the Pearl of Beauty,
    and gracious Olwen, the White Lady of the Day.  Your presence is
    most welcome at this Festival of Imbolc!

    South:

         We welcome the Lords of the South.  Your warmth flows
    through us all, and greetings to the Honored Lady Brighid, and to
    beautiful Branwen, the White Bossomed One.  Your presence is most
    welcome at this Festival of Oemlic!

    West:

         We welcome the Holy Ones of the West.  Your moisture is
    2558

    refreshing and precious to life, and greetings to our Queen
    Arianrhod of The Silver Wheel, and sweet Aine of the Wisps.  Your
    presence is most welcome at this Festival of Lights!

    North:

         We welcome the Watchers of the North.  Your power and wisdom
    is ours, and greetings to the Wise Cerridwen of Lake Tegid, and
    to the desirable Rhiannon of the Netherworld.  Your presence is
    most welcome at this Festival of Candlemas!

    The High Priest continues:

         From now to Beltane, is the pathway less dark.  Thus, shall
    the journey be made through to Beltane, renewed in strength and
    happy in love.

     The High Priestess now turns slowly, addressing those assembled.
    As she speaks, the Maiden walks slowly into view down the
    processional towards the Circle, until she stands at the Northern
    Gateway.  She is holding the Cross of Rushes.  The High Priestess
    says:

         Long Winter is now passing away and the buds will soon swell
    on the Apple tree bough.  The Earth gladly receives the plow in
    preparation for the celebration of life.  For the Queen and the
    King will begin to wear the garden's green and will speak in a
    single voice!

         The High Priest acknowledges the physical presence of the
    Maiden, and exclaims:

         Behold!!! Brighid has come!  Brighid is welcome!

         The Maiden enters the Circle and lays the Cross on a mat
    situated just South of the Altar.  She says:

         Greetings to you, not only from myself, but from the Mother
    and the Crone as well.  All seasons of the Earth are important
    and must have their course.....but now, I weary of Winter, and I
    long for the greenness of Spring, and all that it encompasses.  I
    strongly desire the companionship of my Lover-to be!

         She searches the Circle of people and draws him out.  She
    kneels before him and invokes the God Lugh:

         Lord of Death, Resurrection, Life, and the Giver of Life!
    Lord who is within us, whose name is Mystery of Mysteries!
    Descend we pray thee, upon thy servant and Priest!

         Lugh, after indwelling the Priest, now moves over to the
    Altar, picks up the Phallic Wand, and places it on Brighid's Bed
    (the mat).  The Maiden addresses the God:

         I grow weary of the darkness.  Let's join to hurry Winter
    along its way so we can enjoy the pleasures that await us!  (She
    motions to the mat).

    2559

         The God starts the Balefire in the South, and while doing
    this, the Maiden sweeps the Circle three times while everyone
    chants:

         Return, return, return, return
         The earth, the water, the fire, and the air.

         At an appropriate time, the singing comes to an end and the
    God says:

         The Key to unlocking Winter's hold is to erase its memories!

         He now holds up a sprig of evergreen and hands it to the
    Maiden Goddess.  She tosses it into the Balefire.  She then picks
    up a basket full of everyone's desires and wishes for the coming
    season, and says:

         Behold!  In my hands I carry Hopes and Wishes for the coming
    seasons.  I place them in this fire and as quickly as the
    memories of Winter fade, let the Hopes and Wishes just as quickly
    take root!

         She tosses them into the Balefire, and Lugh now says:

         My dear Lady and Lover-to-be, do us great honor by gazing
    into the Crystal and give your people words they can hold as
    their own!

         Brighid picks up the Crystal Ball and holds it between her
    hands.  She gazes into it momentarily before saying:

         All the gods are one God, and the goddesses, one Goddess,
    and there is but one Initiator.  And to every man, his own Truth,
    and the God within.

         Upon hearing this, he smiles and says:

         Come!  Let's feast and make merry on this great occasion!

         The High Priestess steps in front of the altar and raises
    the water and Wine.  She faces North and says:

         In celebration of Brighid's Day, we open the Moongate and
    let the Westwind blow!  We bring Water, life's elixir, to refresh
    ourselves.  We bring the Fruit of the Vine, the drink of the
    gods!  Let us sip and enjoy.  Hail to fair Brighid!

         The High Priestess now picks up the plate of cakes and says:

         Upon this plate are gifts from Erin!  Farrels for us to
    enjoy!  Let us eat and remember the Gods.  These are holy Sabbat
    Cakes.  They bring us sustenance and fill the hunger.  Blessed Be
    Brighid's Feast!  Let us dance in joy and mirth!

         The High Priestess now raises the honey as all say:

         Here is the Sweet Nectar!  Sacred to the Gods!

    2560

         All now partake of the Cakes and Wine.  Sing songs, dance,
    and do anything else that feels appropriate.  (Brighid's Day is a
    traditional time for initiations).  When the celebration is
    winding down, the God, taking the Maiden Goddess into his arms,
    declares:

         Now that we all have feasted and made merry, come with me
    now, our bed of Love awaits us!

         The Maiden, protesting lightly, responds:

         Oh!  How I've longed for you through the Dark days of
    Winter!  But My Love, though our bed is ready, we still must wait
    a short while.  Our time of Union is not yet upon us, but the
    Rites of Spring, and of Beltane, are not far off!

         The Sun King looks slightly disappointed, but smiles
    lovingly at her.  They embrace and kiss passionately, while
    everyone starts to sing, "Lady Weave Your Circle Tight."  While
    the song continues, she slowly leaves his arms and exits the
    Circle.  He follows her, not wanting her to leave, but stops at
    the Circle's edge.  She turns and says to him:

         My Heart is with you, and Destiny will bring us back
    together soon!  As the Cup is to the Knife, so am I to you!

         She now disappears out of sight, and the singing shall die
    down.  The High Priest now says:

         Even though the Maiden has departed, her presence continues
    to increase!  Light chases away the Darkness, and soon, the
    Maiden shall reign Supreme!  The Winter grows short, and the
    leaves shall return to the trees!  New Life shall spring forth,
    and New Love along with it!  The Wheel turns, and the Young Lord
    and his Lady shall meet to consummate their Love.  So ends this
    prelude to Spring!  May the coming season bring you much joy and
    happiness!

         The Watchtowers are now given their release:

         Farewell to the Watchtowers of the North, and to Rhiannon
    and Cerridwen.  May we depart in love and peace until we gather
    again.

    West:

         Farewell to the Holy Ones of the West, and to Queen
    Arianrhod and Aine.  May we depart in love and peace until me
    gather again.

    South:

         Farewell to the Lords of the South, and to Branwen and the
    Maiden Brighid.  May we depart in love and peace until we gather
    again.

    East:

    2561

         Farewell to the Guardians of the East, and to Olwen and
    Fand.  May we depart in love and peace until we gather again.

    Everyone:

         Merry meet, and merry part, and merry meet again!
