    LIBER III
    THE ONLY SIN OF MANKIND
    IS SHAME TAUGHT THROUGH LIES

    By: DRACONIS:*:ANK-SHA-SAROON

    I
    The Sin of Man is shame. When Eve ate from the Tree of Life she knew the
    truth. The truth was Shame. Then she Gave the fruit to Adam. Who was taught
    the Lies of Man.

    The snake was not a serpent. He was the Lies. He taught them the truth of
    shame. For it has been seen inside His eyes!

    The Sin is here and shall always be. Nothing can hide it. The woman had
    given man the gift. The gift of Shame. So too did Christianity. Christ gave
    the gift of Shame. For shame is the only Sin of Mankind.

    All Mankind knoweth is Shame. For Shame is the lies taught by the Child. The
    Child was the Son. The One was the Father. And the Lies were the Holy
    Spirit.

    For Mankind know now the lies. They will never forget. Thier desires are
    then never met. For they are blinded by the lies. The Lies of Shame.

    II
    The Will is the Control,
    The Will is the life!
    Spread Will until you All,
    And fear Not for I have come!

    I am Here. I have always Been,
    I shall teach to You the Sin!

    III

    The Sin of Man is Shame,
    Repeat not he mistake again!
    Teach love and naught fear,
    For I am always here!
    I shall arise until the end,
    And teach to you my friends!
