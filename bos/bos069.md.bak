              >What would a Wiccan provide as an explanation for behavior that was
              >"contrary"  in the  sense that  you've given?   We've all  seen folks
              behave in a way that is *apparently* inconsistent with stated beliefs,
              even  those that are closely held.   What do you  believe is the basis
              for the difference between  a "positive direction along the  Path" and
              actual behavior that is  contrary to this  by one who earnestly  seeks
              "the Path"?   The  answer  is stated  clearly  enough for  many  other
              religions, but I've  never had  the opportunity to  hear a Wiccan  add
              his/her windage on this  topic.  Flip Wilson's answer  obviously isn't
              going to apply, so where do we go with it? ;)

              Chris,  sorry for the delay in answering your question. I have written
              and re-written my response, and although I still may not have answered
              your question herein, I feel that I must reply at last.

              First, I must stipulate that what follows is my own interpretation of
              Wiccan belief, and my own sense of "morals." You know, the usual
              disclaimer.

              Second, I wish  to deal briefly with the concept  of separation of Law
              and Moral.  What I am writing  here has absolutely no  relation to the
              practice of law. I do not advocate murder, for example, nor do I think
              that murder  should go unpunished  by the State.  I recognize that  we
              live in  a society which  must have  rules in order  that the  maximum
              amount of  freedom may be enjoyed by  all. I would not  hesitate, if I
              were a  juror, to vote to send  a proven criminal to  jail, or even to
              death, if the situation warranted it.  Therefore, let none who read my
              words  mistake my moral convictions with my beliefs about our judaical
              system - I  am not in disagreement  with the majority  of our laws  as
              they exist.

              Finally; the point:

              To save space, I'll  omit the dictionary definition of  'sin.' I think
              we all understand that Christians believe  in sin, Wiccans do not.  As
              you have stated, members  of other religions have their  rules clearly
              stated,  so that  one may  easily decide  if one  is in  error or  not
              (although it's often not  quite *that* easy). Wiccans claim  to follow
              only the Rede, which states, "An it harm none, do as thou shalt."

              You have asked how a Wiccan can stray from such a path. The answer is
              complex and far-reaching, and even  delves into (ugh) philosophy. I'll
              try to keep it succinct.

                                                                                 227

              If one  thoughtfully examines  the Rede,  it quickly  becomes apparent
              that almost  every action has  the potential to harm  some creature in
              some  way.  Drawing breath can kill micro-organisms that float unseen,
              in  the  atmosphere. Drinking  water does  the  same thing.  One could
              choose to marry,  and ultimately  bring pain and  suffering on  future
              generations of children by way of an unhappy union. There is literally
              no way that  one could  possibly foresee all  circumstances and  avoid
              harming  anyone.  Yet, that  is  what the  Rede  demands. What  is the
              answer?

              In my opinion, the answer is obvious. The Wiccan must choose. Each and
              every  Wiccan  is  responsible for  their  own  actions,  and will  be
              accountable to themselves for the results of those actions. The wheels
              turns, and  each Wiccan reaps what they have sown. No Godly mandate or
              indulgence can  save us from the  results of our own  actions, be they
              good or bad. But, with ultimate responsibility comes ultimate freedom.
              No God can shackle  my soul or subject me to that which I do not Will.
              I am supreme  within myself, and I am the "captain of my soul." I have
              chosen to obey  certain of society's laws and mores.  I have chosen to
              be a "good" man. Mine is the reward for choosing such action, and mine
              will  be  the   punishment  if   I  fail  to   meet  my   self-imposed
              responsibilities. As you jested, I cannot claim Flip Wilson's
              famous defence. Nor do I claim that such things as I do well stem from
              my Creator -  in ultimate hubris, I claim that "As  I Will, so mote it
              be."

              Every day,  I am met with  new decisions. I make  those decisions, and
              then I live  with the consequences of my actions.  In my opinion, that
              is what makes me human, what sets me apart from the animals. Man alone
              can  choose,  man  alone  is  not  chained  to  genetically  imprinted
              behavior.

              I have been asked why, if there is the possibility  that the Christian
              deity exists, do I not choose Christianity  on the possibility that it
              is  correct? This  is  Pascal's famous  wager.  If I  wager that  (the
              Christian) God exists and I  am correct, then I win all. If I am wrong
              and  God does  not exist,  then I  have lost  nothing, and  have lived
              (hopefully)  a  good and  productive life  in  the bargain.  Why would
              anyone not  accept this wager? My  answer to that is that  I would not
              willingly serve any  God that  would choose one  of His/Her  creations
              over another,  the good over the bad, the shriven over the heathen. If
              I had  definitive proof  that such  a  God existed,  I would  actively
              oppose  Him/Her. I would rather  suffer the cold  comfort of damnation
              than continue to  exist in a hereafter peopled with  only the "saved."
              This is my choice, and again, as I Will, so mote it be.

                                                                                 228

              >What  do  you believe  is  the  basis for  the  difference  between a
              "positive  direction  along  the  Path" and  actual  behavior  that is

              A fine, difficult  question, Chris. As you've  stated elsewhere, we've
              been dancing all around this one for some time. Here goes:

              I cannot  determine what any one  individual's Path is. I  am not even
              sure of my own. I often follow forks in  the road until they come to a
              dead end, and  have to double back. Of course,  that's the problem one
              faces in  following one's own Will,  and not a set  of directions laid
              down by God. My concept of the Path is that it is like many roads, all
              of  which lead  eventually to self-knowledge  (enlightenment, Godhead,
              nirvana, and so on). In my theology, my ultimate goal is to become one
              with the  God of my creation  by gaining divine  knowledge, or gnosis.
              We've  discussed the concept of "hidden knowledge"  in the past, yet I
              feel that my understanding of gnosis differs from yours.

              The entire concept  of the  ancient mystery religions,  and of  modern
              "occult" (which mean only 'hidden' after all)  religions and practices
              was based on  the concept of the  inverted filter. Each  person passed
              through   successive  layers   of  filters,   gaining   knowledge  and
              understanding at each  stop, until they could  absorb no more (and  so
              could  not pass through the next layer  of filter). Of course, at each
              level,  the  initiate  was given  to  believe that  they  were  now in
              possession of secret knowledge, and ultimate truth. If they could find
              legitimate questions that led  them to reject or doubt  those 'truths'
              and seek deeper meaning, then they passed through to the next level of
              understanding. If they did not question, then they were satisfied that
              they had gained truth.

              This 'hidden knowledge' can be obtained outside of the constraints of
              organized religion; in fact  it originally was obtained independently.
              Just as Newton's  Laws could  eventually be  figured out  by a  person
              ignorant  of his discoveries, one  could find a  Path to enlightenment
              separate  from  any of  the mystery  religions.  However, just  as one
              attends school  to learn that which  is already known,  so one pursues
              illumination  from the teachings  of those  who have  already achieved
              more than oneself.

              Further,  I do not  believe that there  is one 'right'  Path. I accept
              that the OTO has valuable knowledge to impart. I accept that Christian
              Mystics,  Jewish Quabalists,  Muslim Sufis,  and so  on all  have some
              piece of the puzzle, and that all will eventually converge on the road
              to wisdom. I  know because I  have been to  that intersection once  or
              twice,  although I  am not there  now. My Path  is my own,  and as Van
              Morrison said, I have "No teacher, no guru, no method."

              Can  I  move in  a direction  that  is contrary  to  positive movement
              towards  the Laughing  Light?  You bet.  The tough  part  is that  the
              definition of what is or is not 'positive' is not  static. An example:
              it might  be proper that I  learn what it means to  take another human
              being's life by killing an intruder in my home. It might not be proper
              that I learn that lesson by following the orders of a superior officer
              in time of war. OR VICE VERSA.  I must choose at every instance, and I
              might  not immediately know  if my choice  has given or  taken from my
              search for truth.


                             Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 


                                                                                 229

              There are also times when I might know that I am actively choosing to
              deviate  from my Path.  I might choose  to sooth a  feeling of anxiety
              about whether or not  I can pay the rent  this month by yelling  at my
              wife.  I'm not  using this as  an example because  it is traditionally
              "wrong,"  but  because  I know  that  I  cannot solve  my  problems by
              transferring my anxiety to others.  If  I choose to ignore what I have
              already learned, then not only have I lost ground, but I  will have to
              deal with the anger that I've given out at some point.

              In conclusion, I believe that I am responsible for my own actions, as
              others are for theirs. I also believe that if I commit an action which
              may  seem 'right' to me, but  which society has deemed  to be a crime,
              I'll be  punished by society  for breaking  that law.  I would  punish
              those who break the laws which are meant to hold our society together,
              such as prohibitions on murder, burglary, and so forth. I believe that
              my moral convictions are  binding only on myself,  not on others,  and
              that I'll ultimately  deal with  the consequences of  my thoughts  and
              deeds.  I believe that I  have no right to judge  the moral content of
              another's actions. I believe in the  Wiccan Rede, "An it harm none, do
              as  thou shalt,"  and I further  believe that  it is meant  to make me
              consider  my  actions  and their  consequences,  and  to  make my  own
              decisions, rather than as a prohibition against any specific action.

              There  is much that I  do not know  about Godhead; much that  I do not
              know about Right and Wrong. I  have only my instincts and intellect to
              guide me, but I trust myself to make the right decisions eventually.
