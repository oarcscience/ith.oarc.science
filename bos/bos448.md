              CompuServe on-line Imbolc Ritual, 1990
               
              (Ladyhawk) 
              This is Imbolc...or Candlemas...or Brigit's day 
              This is the feast of the waxing light. 
              What was born at the Winter Solstice begins to manifest 
              The Lady, midwife to the infant year, 
              now sees the Child Sun grow strong 
              as the days grow visibly longer. 
              It is a time of beginnings, 
              when we select the seed we will later plant, 
              nurture, and eventually harvest. 
               
              After I do each invocation, I will pause and let each of you say
              a FEW words no more than 2 lines, please...to your particular
              deity 
               
              Right now, I'd like everyone to ground and center themselves... 
              in the way that is best for you. 
              As you do, see yourself bathed in a white light, cleansing you
              and your area. 
               
              Now, mentally turn to the East: 
              Powers of the East 
              We bid you come 
              To witness our rite 
              And protect us! 
               
              Now mentally turn to the South: 
              Powers of the South 
              We bid you come 
              To witness our rite 
              And protect us! 
               
              <Now mentally turn to the West:> 
              Powers of the West 
              We bid you come 
              To witness our rite 
              And protect us! 
               
              <Now mentally turn to the North:> 
              Powers of the North 
              We bid you come 
              To witness our rite 
              And protect us! 
               
              <Back once more to the East and in your own way, salute the East
              again> 
               
              Now, let us all link together 
              Feel the earth energy welling up from the bowels of the Earth,
              our Mother 
              Feel it rise to our feet and up through our bodies 
              White light energy 
              Feel it flow through us and link us, 



                                                                                2097

              one with the other 
              So finally we feel and see the circle of energy, 
              the circle of power 
              binding us together and setting us apart 
              In a space not of this time, but of all times 
              Not of these places, but all places! 
              Blessed Be! 
               
              Sun King! 
              Horned One of animals and wild places 
              Joyously we ask you come! 
              All the land is wrapped in the chill of winter 
              The trees are bare and 
              the air is cold. 
              Yet still our hearts are glad 
              For we know you have been reborn 
              And nurtured in your early days 
              By the gracious Mother Goddess, 
              Lady of all fertility. 
              We bid you welcome 
              And rejoice in your growing strength! 
              Hail Great God! 
              Hail and Welcome!     <ga> 
               
              (Jehana) Hail & Welcome! 
               
              (Ocean Mist) u!/u 
               
              (Shadow Hawk) Hail Mother, from you the Sun once more does grow!

               
              (Gwynndon) Hail and Welcome! 
               
              (Shadowstar) Welcome, Lord of the Sun! 
               
              (Jehana) Brigid, Arianhrod, Cerridwyn, Herne... Welcome! 
               
              (Larne) Welcome Lord!  Share with us your warmth and light! 
               
              (Ocean Mist) Hail and welcome in your new light! 
               
              (Ladyhawk) 
              Great Goddess, Noble Lady! 
              Known to the Celts as Brigit, Bride, Cerridwen, and more 
              Goddess of Light 
              Keeper of the sacred wells! 
              We gather tonite to honor your 
              who has nurtured the Sun King. 
              As the spring lambs are born 
              and the ewes come to milk, 
              as we sense spring itself 
              so close 
              We bid you welcome as we 
              Clear out the old and make way for the new 
              Welcome Lady 



                                                                                2098

              Welcome and all Hail! 
               
              (Gwynndon) Bride is come! Bride is Welcome! 
               
              (Jehana) Welcome, bright lady, spark of inspiration! 
               
              (Rita) Welcome, Great Mother.  Welcome and grow strong, Young
              Lord. 
               
              (Shadowstar) Welcome, Lady of Light! 
               
              (Larne) Welcome Lady!  Nurture and help us as we grow! 
               
              (Shadow Hawk) Mother smile upon us and bring us Life, Son shine
              down upon us and bring us Light! 
               
               
              (Ocean Mist) Welcome goddess of light! 
               
              (Ladyhawk) 
              Now, let us each concentrate on that which we need to "sweep out"
              of our lives 
              Picture it as, with a new, clean broom, 
              you sweep it away 
              and it vanishes in the air. 
               
              And now, with ourselves cleansed, 
              let us meditate on that we might wish 
              to plant for this year... 
              the "seed" we will plant in the spring. 
              For, this is the time of chosing the seed 
              and preparing for the planting. 
              Gracious Lady! Help us chose wisely the seed! 
               
              and now, with our seed selected and held dearly in our hearts, 
              it is time to thank the Lady and the Lord. 
              O Sun King, Horned One! 
              We thank thee for thy presence 
              Surely we feel your growing strength 
              In our heart of hearts 
              and find joy in knowing 
              that as the sun grows, 
              so do you! 
              We thank thee for teaching us that 
              even in the depths of winter 
              Life grows! 
              Farewell, Lord, if you must go. 
              Though, gladly would we have you stay and 
              rejoice with us. 
              Hail, Sun King! 
               
              Gracious Lady, 
              We thank thee for thy guidance 
              in selecting our seed. 
              Truly will we hold it in our hearts 



                                                                                2099

              Till the time of planting. 
              We thank thee also 
              For teaching us the wisdom 
              of cleansing and letting go 
              of that which is no longer useful to us. 
              Thus do we heal of past hurts 
              and grow in strength, even as does our Lord. 
              We thank thee 
              and bid you farewell if you must go, 
              but gladly would we have you stay 
              and rejoice with us! 
              Hail, Gracious Lady! 
               
              And now, we will let our circle sink back into the Earth once
              again. 
              For all that comes of the Earth, must surely return to Her. 
              But even as the circle departs, 
              know that we are still bound 
              By our love of the Gods 
              and the Love between us. 
              Blessed Be! 
               
              (Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be 
               
              (Rita) Blessed Be! 
               
              (Ocean Mist) Blessed Be! 
               
              (Shadowstar) Blessed Be! 
               
              (Larne) Farewell Lord and Lady.  Depart our circle, but be always
              with us.  
                      Blessed Be! 
               
              (Jehana) Blessed Be!  So Mote it Be! 
               
              (Gwynndon) Blessed Be! 
               
              (Vkai) Blessed Be! 
               
              (Ladyhawk) 
              <Now turn in your mind's eye once again to the East> 
              Farewell, Powers of the East 
              We thank you for 
              Your attendence 
              and protection 
              Peace ever between thee and we! 
               
              <Face South> 
              Farewell Powers of the South 
              We thank you for your attendence 
              and protection 
              Peace ever between thee and we! 
               
              <face West> 



                                                                                2100

              Farewell Powers of the West 
              We thank you for your attendence 
              and protection 
              Peace ever between thee and we! 
               
              <face North> 
              Farewell Powers of the North 
              We thank you for your attendence 
              and protection 
              Peace ever between thee and we! 
               
              <once more face East and mentally salute once again> 
               
              The circle is open, but unbroken 
              Merry meet and merry part 
              and merry meet again! 
               
              (Shadow Hawk) Merry Meet and Merry Part, and Merry Meet Again! 
               
              (Ladyhawk) <The Rite is ended> 
               
              (Shadow Hawk) (passing food) 
               
              (Jehana) (Passing drink) 
               
              (Larne) I'll have some of those cakes! 



                                                                                2101
