I. Starting the Ritual
  A) Processional : (starting Chant {Ku-Wa-Te})
     To enter the circle each person must pass through four &quot;gates&quot;    
representing each of the Three Worlds (Land, Sea &amp; Sky) and Fire. Each person
steps to the first Gate Keeper and is asked: &quot;What do you ask of the Gate of
Earth (Sea) (Air)?&quot; AN answer is given or left unspoken, and the person is
marked by the Guardian (with mud, water and brush of a feather) and proceeds
to the next Gate and is questioned again. The Guardian of the last Gate,
Fire, smudges the person before they enter the circle.  When everyone is in
the circle, the chant continues (&quot;Ku-Wa-Te&quot;) as the Gatekeepers come into the
circle and prepare themselves.
   B) Statement of Purpose :
      We are here tonight to honor the Goddess Danu, called the Earth-mother
and to honor the God Belemos, Called the Sun King. We honor them and ask them
to bless us and rekindle the warmth of the world.
   C) Centering Meditation:
     Group meditation and collective consciousness:  All present are brought
together with a group meditation, to form a &quot;group-mind&quot;; to help everyone
center and bring themselves together to work in accord.
  D) Earth Mother Invocation :
         Oh Earth-Mother
         We praise thee
            That seed springeth
            That flower openeth
            That grass groweth
         We praise thee
         For winds that whisper
            Through the shining Birch
            Through the lively Pines
            Through the mighty Oak
         We praise thee
         For all things
         Oh Earth-Mother who gives lifeII.

                             The Active Ritual

    Invocation of Ogma the Gate Keeper or Mannanon in English:
    (Visualization is a triangle shaped iris opening)

 Gate Keeper of Fire:
   O Ogma, Lord of the Gates, Lord of Knowledge, open the ways for us       
  O Mannanon, master of the realm beyond the seas, grant us passage to your
kingdom.
   O great God of knowledge, we wish to walk your roads.
         Reveal to us your teachings, reveal to us the safe path.           
        Come wash the nighttime clean;
         Come Close the gap of darkness in between.
         We praise you for the brightness of your power.

        You shall reach us, You shall teach us and reveal our fate.
   B) Consecration of the Waters:

 the circle so that each may drink from it. When the cup returns to the start
the remaining liquid is spilled unto the Earth or into the fire. Contents may
be spring water, or an alcholic brew if alcohol it is preferred to have been
brewed by a member of the Grove.]

carried up to thee on the shoulders of the wonds. hear now O Belemos, O Danu,
