               (c) copyright 1984, 1992 W. J. Bethancourt III 
               recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE, WTP-0002
               tune: "Same Old Man/Leatherwing Bat" (Trad. Appalachian)
                                            
            Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
            Once I talked to a great Grey Man
            Spun three times and said with a sigh
            Hadn't been for the Runes had His other eye!
                                            
    Chorus: Hi diddle i diddle i day                  
            Hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay            
            Hi di diddle i diddle i day               
            Fol the dink a dum diddle do di day                                   
                                                                                  
     Hi said the Lady, dressed in green       Came the Stag from oaken wood       
     Prettiest thing I've ever seen           Saw the Lady where She stood        
     She went down underneath the hill        By the fire burning bright          
     And came back out of Her own free will   Came to know His heart's delight!   
                                                                                  
     Brian Boru, on Irish ground               Hail to the Lady, One in Three     
     Walked three times the Island round       We welcome You and honour Thee     
     Norsemen came lookin for a fight          As You light and guard the night   
     just another Irish Saturday night!        Honour now our sacred rite!        
                                                                            
     Hi said Lugh on the banquet night           Hi said the Lady dressed in white
     A poet and a player and a good wheelwright  Sang the Day and sang the Night 
     A harper and a warrior and none the least:  Sang the Land and sang the Sea  
     A Druid and he got in to the Feast!         Sang the Song, and then sang me!
                                                                               
     Harold Haardrada's face was red!      Hail to the Lord at the Lady's side 
     Came to Britain and he wound up dead  Master of the Hunt, in the day You ride
     Stamford Bridge is where he's found   Fire burn and fire bright          
     Got six feet of English ground        Honour now our sacred rite!        
                                                                              
     The Legion with its Eagles bright      The Circle forms, the Circle flows
     Marched into the Pictish night         The Circle goes where no man knows
     Met them there upon the sand            Hail to the Lady, one in three:  
     Gave 'em up to the Wicker Man!          Present is past and past is me!  
                                                                              
     Eight-legged steed and hound of Hel    By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
     The One-Eyed Man, he loves ya well     Blessed Be: the Day I've found    
     Fire burn and fire spark               Hail to the Lady, one in Three    
     Are you then feared of the dark?       Present is Past and Past is WE    
                                                                              
     Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight    Fire and Water, Air and Earth    
     all thru the day, all thru the night    The Cauldron calls for our rebirth 
     Hail to the Lady, one in Three          Hail to the Lady, three times three
     Present is past and past is Thee!       The Circle's cast; so mote it be! 
                                                                              
     Salt and oil and mirror bright        From East and South and West and North  
     Fire and fleet and candlelight        Call the Powers to come forth!     
     By fin and feather, leaf and tree,    Hail to the Lady, three times three,
     Fill the Cup and Blessed Be!          The Circle's cast; so mote it be!   
                                                                              
     From the misty crystal sea                 By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn      
     Came the Lady to the lea                   Blessed Be the day you're born!  
     Sword and Roses in Her Hand                Fire burn and fire bright         
     Spread their seeds thruout the Land        Walk in safety thru the night       


                                                                                2289
