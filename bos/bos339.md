                                  Channeling For Fun And Prophet 
                                        Farrell J. McGovern
                 
                
                    Channelling is one of the more popular parts of what is call the
              "New Age".  It is also one  of the most controversial  aspects of this
              movement.
                 
                    To properly channelsomeone, be itMarylin Monroe, AliesterCrowley
              (I have been told this doesn't  work well...) or Devine, one must know
              something of  this person. The  easiest way  is by reading  about this
              person. Autobiographies are the best, of course, but biographies, news
              reports, or even old photos are  almost as good. You need some connec-
              tion...
                 
                    InPagandom, and Wicca, popular beingsfor channelling are various
              aspects of the God and  the Goddess. Again, one  must know as much  as
              possible  about the  Lady or  Lord that  you are  going to  bring into
              yourself for the enjoyment, edification and education of the others in
              the Circle with you.
                 
                    The  most popular source of information on Gods and Goddesses is
              again in  books. Since there are  many aspects of deities,  there is a
              great deal of literature  about these beings. Most of  this literature
              that is over a couple of hundred  of years old is usually in the  form
              of Fables or Epics, which have more literary content than reality. One
              could easily call these works Docu-dramas, but they are still fiction.
                 
                    "But..." I hear you ask,"How can they channel these beingsif all
              they know about  them is fictional?"  Well, there seems  to be  enough
              consensus  on certain deities, but not on all. But these rituals work,
              as  anyone  who has  attended the  beautiful  "Drawing Down  the Moon"
              ritual of Wicca.
                 
                    So  it seems to  me that the  idea of a  "consensual reality" is
              created from the energies that all these people put into their concept
              of whatever  God or  Goddess they  believe in. There  are hundreds  of
              thousands, maybe  even  millions of  people who  believe in  Cerwdwin,
              Eris, Hecate, Cherenous, and others. But...are there not also millions
              of people who believe in Captain James T.  Kirk? Arthur Dnt? Catwoman?
              Batman? Smurfs?.....or even Peewee Herman?
                 
                    Imaginesome Circle performing the DrawingDown The Moon ceremony,
              and due to a lack of concentration by the priestess, she channels, not
              Athena, but  Marry Tyler-Moore?!?!?!? Or the  priest channeling PeeWee
              Herman?!?!?!
                 
                    Weshall leave the furtherexploration of thisto some experimental
              coven...but please!  If you manage  to channel Papa  Smurf....we DON'T
              want to hear about it!


                                                                                1737
