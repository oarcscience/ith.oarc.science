                    Theforegoing was delivered on July 20, 1989, through the trance-
              mediumship  of  Carla Neff  Gordan by  the  Spirit Guide  "Mary." Mary
              stated that these ideas will also be released through other mediums in
              six different areas of  the world. In preface to  these "Commandments"
              Mary said the following:

                    "Youare a loving,connected community oflike-minded souls assist-
              ing  through our inner connection. You are becoming a profound  source
              of awakening for  your world. These rules are to  open your hearts, to
              teach  you self-love,  to calm  your emotion  to help  you to  live in
              reality that you have wished. To grow, first you must  become a source
              of  service. There  must  be a  difference in  earth because  you have
              walked  here. Now is  the time of  shifting your energy  into a higher
              place through  unconditional love. A part  of your purpose  is to heal
              the earth  through holy, or  wholeness, relationships. You  will begin
              now."

                


                                                                                1723
