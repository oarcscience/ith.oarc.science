                          *                 
                                            
                    NOTTAMUN TOWN           
                         -Traditional       
                                            
        In Nottamun Town, in Nottamun Town  
        Not a soul would look up not a soul would look down
        Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
        To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town
                                            
        I bought me a horse t'was called a grey mare
        Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
        Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
        Weren't a hair upon her that was not coal black
                                            
        She stood so still threw me to the dirt
        She tore at my hide, she bruised my shirt
        From saddle to stirrup I mounted again
        and on my ten toes I rode over the plain
                                            
        When I got there no one did I see   
        they all stood around me just looking at me
        i called for a cup to drive gladness away
        And stifle the dust for it rained the whole day
                                            
        And the King and the Queen and the company more
        Came a riding behind and a walking before
        Come a stark naked drummer beating a drum
        With his hands in his bosom came marching along
                                            
        Sat down on a hard hot cold frozen stone
        Ten thousand stood round me but I was alone
        Took my heart in my hand to keep myself warm
        Ten thousand was drowned that never was born
                                            
                             *              


                                                                                2310
