                                                       Minerva 

                       I met Minerva just now near her tree 
                       Resting from battle 
                       Her helmet on her knee 
                       Hair tumbled on breasts 
                        
                       Parted by brass, surrounded by steel plate 
                       Dark nipples glistened 
                       With dew-like sweat of war 
                       Pale arms quivering 
                        
                       Eager for battle's harsh life-death embrace 
                       Yes! She said to me. 
                       Hell yes! she said.  Get laid! 
                       Enter the battle. 
                        
                       My Virgins serve me well, my son!  Get laid! 
                       Let your juices flow! 
                       (She spit an olive pit) 
                       Get in there and fight! 
                        
                       She gathered her pale skirts around her hips 
                       Stood, covering strong thighs 
                       Took her shield, sword, helmet 
                       With war shriek was gone 
                        


                                                                                               1888
