                                       Treatise on Mind 

                                        From: The Tigress  



                    From themoment that 2 cells forma zygote, we see the interaction

              of  informational process  - recognition,  communication, interaction,

              integration,  re-stabilization and reproduction  and or re-structuriz-

              ation.   This cycle of life can be see from the barest combinations of

              any two elemental  components beginning  at the  lowest atomic  desig-

              nations  of energy  and throughout  the  continuum of  increasing com-

              plexity - perhaps far beyond our capabilities 

              to  understand.  ***  If consciousness  can be defined as an awareness

              of integrity through this process of self recognition; then conscious-

              ness can be easily applied to that which is non-human.*** 

                

                    Fromthe most basicinteractions of chemistry, wefind that even on

              an atomic level there  is to be found this type of  consciousness.  We

              have  become aware  of the  atom's necessary  maintenance of  it's own

              structure  through the  evidence  of necessary  balancing of  protons,

              neutrons and electrons;  the importance of electron  shell valences is

              also a reminder of this  type of integrity.  Even on an  atomic level,

              there is a  form of awareness  of self-integrity in order  to maintain

              structure and identity. 

                

                        Thisprocess of awarenessis also agenius of discrimination. A

              form  of identification  of self  & non  self on  an  energetic level.

              There  is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when

              this process of self recognition begins to fail we see the destruction

              of the matter  it involves <this is evident with  atomic structure and

              also evident at the human level in the study of  cancer.> Therefore we

              might look  at this  process of  self-recognition and  maintenance and


                                                                                1461

              examine it's nature in order to find its function and capabilities. 

                

                        Whenwe look atdifferent types ofmatter, we findthat the more

              simple the atomic structure of the mass, the  less complex its process

              of  "consciousness" needs to be.   Things which  are comprised of only

              one  atomic component do  not need complex  processes of communication

              between those components.   Thus the level of consciousness  is rather

              low on an evolutionary scale of creativity, yet we also see that these

              types of  things are far more  stable in regards to  their integrity -

              far less vulnerable  to destruction.   In example, it takes  an enorm-

              ously concentrated force of heat to break the integrity of an atom...-

              yet a  mere 2000 degree flame  will not only destroy  the integrity of

              human consciousness, but also destroy the integrity of  the individual

              component  molecules which form the material mass  of a human to their

              lowest forms as individual atoms. 

                


                                                                                1462

                        Whenwe look at theforces involved incommunication of energy,

              we  see  a flowing  medium of  different  frequencies within  a single

              spectrum  of  energetic  potential.   Elemental  energies  and  forces

              <light,  sound,  temperature,  pressure,   magnetism,  electricity...>

              differentiate and vary in  intensity and frequency yet are  very alike

              in  that they are all  means of transferring energy  as a form of com-

              munication which can be informative/stabilizing or disinformative/des-

              tructive,  depending  on the  structure  of  the "consciousness"  they

              encounter.  It  may be perceived that the more  complex the structure,

              the lower the  frequency of the  integrity of that  structure and  the

              more vulnerable that structure is to disinformation. 

               

                   The  more diverse the components  are that are  included within a

              thing,  and the more efficient  the means of  communication within the

              structure  of that thing; the  lower the common  denomination of freq-

              uency of integrity must  be in order that the  informational frequency

              will not be  destructive to any  of the component  parts.  To  analyze

              this statement we must look at other analogies within our environment.

              Firstly I would like to examine the nature of sound. 

                

                   Sound waves come  in varying frequencies and  modulations, and as

              humans we assign different  notes to those steps within  the frequency

              spectrum which we can differentiate and perceive.   If we play several

              notes  simultaneously, we  find that  in order  to maintain  a balance

              harmonically, we  must play notes  that match each  others modulation.

              You can play a "C"  note at any octave and in fact play  all "C" notes

              simultaneously and  you  will find  that  within the  frequency  range

              these notes will compliment each other, in fact they will contribute/-

              share  energy with each other.  WE find similar matching if we look at

              musical chording.  If you play the notes "F" and "C" , the  sharing of


                                                                                1463

              energy vibrationally  between those  two ranges  of frequency  will in

              fact create  the note  of "A"  in the  range in  which  the two  notes

              frequencies  overlap.  In this way communication is informative and in

              fact the  "whole is greater"  than the sum  of its parts.   Similarly,

              playing  two notes which lie in the same modulation frequencies simul-

              taneously  will increase the duration of the vibration compared to the

              duration if each note were played alone. 

                

                   When we  examine  the sharing  of  electrical information  at  an

              atomic level, we see  that through the temporary sharing  of electrons

              in a  phase path  also indicates something  that we might  consider as

              investing a thing <atom> with more than the sum of its parts.   Simil-

              arly in using electric  frequencies in a series, we  store information

              on silicon chips which invest them with more than they would be if one

              simply  looked at the electrical  and silicon components  alone.  This

              transference  of  energy  is also  a  transference  of  information in

              frequencies which in many ways we are still attempting to understand. 

               

                   Simple, one component things,  can sustain far higher frequencies

              of  energetic  transmission than  can  complex  components of  things.

              Frequencies which pass freely through atoms ultimately destroy complex

              things such as humans when they are subject to  them.  It appears that

              the more complex  the union  of the  components, the  slower and  more

              tediously  complex the  transformation  of data  must  be.   The  more

              complex a thing is,  the lower the vibrational capability  it sustains

              in order to maintain the integrity of its own structure. 

                


                                                                                1464

                   Energetic  communication exists  infinitely throughout  the univ-

              erse.  The transference  of information through radio waves  and light

              waves  continues back in time to the occasion of what was known as the

              Big Bang.  It may be that in the future we will find that in the  same

              way gravity  and electromagnetism  are also continuums  of information

              from  times long past.   Scientifically we study  these energetic con-

              tinuums and yet we doubt and deny the holistic communicative nature of

              the  universe.  We search for causes  and effects within the realms of

              our limited  perceptions and  are amazed  when we  can find  no causal

              effects to explain change. 

                

                   When we examine  biological life, we find  that each evolutionary

              adaptation seems to be  an extension of  the process of self/non  self

              awareness and maintenance  of integrity.   Not only  do we see  inten-

              sification  of sensory perceptual abilities, but also we note that the

              integrational and responsive/reactive   components of the process also

              have to evolve and adapt in order to stay integrated with  the rest of

              the "consciousness".  Amoebas are "simple" life forms, and  yet we can

              examine them and see that each organic component within that life form

              serves  as an  informational  and communicative  component within  the

              process of  maintaining the integrity <life> of  the whole.  When this

              communication  process or any part  of it ceases,  the organization of

              the organism begins to deteriorate and eventually ceases and dies.  In

              biological  life, we find  that though we  have maintained the  use of

              electronic  communication on some neural  levels, we have  sunk to the

              depths of  transferring  actual molecular  compounds <proteins,  amino

              acids...> in  most of our  organic processes.   Even the human  brain,

              supposed  highest achievement  of  organic life  forms, requires  base

              molecular  salts  in order  to  process electrical  information.   Our

              complexity denies us the speed of light, radio, 


                                                                                1465

              and other  faster and higher  frequency modes of  communication except

              from outside of ourselves. 

                

                   The  human consciousness is a  genius of discrimination.   We use

              the  abilities of discrimination to  identify those stimuli which come

              from outside of our biological forms  in order to protect and maintain

              our  integrity <life.  We use  our senses <inefficient though they may

              be>  to gather and interpret pure energetic communications such as the

              radiated  energy of sunlight and we are so inefficient at interpreting

              that data that we can only sense  light and heat and it destroys those

              sensors that gather that information through blindness and sunburn  if

              we continue too long in our attempts.  Yet, 

              conversely ,  we need the  information from sunlight  which stimulates

              our organic forms  into producing  vitamin D <without  which we  would

              die>.  Is this a  remnant of  photosynthetic capabilities  from lessor

              complex integrations,  or merely a  new attempt at  further increasing

              our potential? 

                

                   As organic forms of  consciousness, we are sorely limited  in our

              perceptions  of the  universe.    Limited  in exploring  the  possibly

              limitless ranges of energetic exchange simply due to the limits placed

              upon  communication due to the complexity  of our component structure.

              Yet  rather than admit to our limitations, we seek further exploration

              through  the development of tools  made from things  less complex than

              ourselves.   In the laboratory, we use  light waves and shaped silicon

              to create microscopes to increase our sense of visual acuity within 

              the  spectrum of  visible radiation  imaging.  In  the studio,  we use

              simple cones flattened  vegetable matter and  electronic amplification

              to create  tools to compensate  for our limited aural  perception.  We

              have created  many tools out of simpler and less complex components in


                                                                                1466

              order  to reach  those  higher frequencies  of  information which  are

              either  so far removed from us as  to be imperceptible, or so destruc-

              tive to us that we dare not experience them ourselves. 

                

                   The  human zygote from the moment of conception is a discriminat-

              ing consciousness which is involved in the  differentialization of its

              components in order to 

              develop finer  levels of complexity.   This fetus is  also even before

              birth  learning to  interpret  communicative energies  from the  outer

              world in order  to begin definition  of itself, its integrity  and its

              maintenance  of  self apart  from the  influence  of "other".   Cells,

              joining together  in communication  to form co-operative  systems each

              with separate  responsibilities to the  whole.   Organs with  specific

              functions  supporting the organism in its fight to maintain its integ-

              rity.  Consciousness of Mind, determining the  difference between self

              and non self, regulating the integrity  of the whole.  This harmony of

              components within a symphony  of orchestration, this is the  matter of

              being alive. 

                

                   Despite our complexities, despite recognition of our  vulnerabil-

              ities and limitations; we as  humans are beings of arrogant mind.   We

              claim supremacy over all biological organisms and claim the sole right

              to conscious thought <as if we were the only from  of communication we

              wished to  recognize.>   We deny our  insecurities and  lay claims  to

              great understandings concerning the  universe, when we in fact  do not

              even  understand the actual workings of our own process of integration

              and communication within our own biological forms. 

              We claim  ownership of consciousness,  yet we  do not even  pretend to

              truly evaluate the process of consciousness nor its beginnings. 

                


                                                                                1467

                   Despite our inadequacies,  we assume  to know the  nature of  the

              beginnings of  all life.  We  claim to know  the "mind" of  "God" <the

              prime causation for all that exists> and we claim title to superiority

              in emulation of this "God" - above and beyond all other  forms of life

              or integrity.  An egotistic lot are we, who strive to seek security in

              the midst  of  our fear,  our  inadequacies, our  vulnerabilities;  by

              developing a system of belief which guarantees our security in a place

              beyond our perception.  We seek safety and foundation at the same time

              that we reach outward to claim flight amongst the stars. 

                

                   This is the  paradox on humanity, of  mind.  Complexity  found in

              simplicity... using simplicity to explore  a universe beyond the range

              of our complex integrity.  Our complex integrity vulnerable to all but

              the  simplest energies,  while we  lay grasp  to use  complex energies

              which would destroy us in  order to prove our strength.  What it is we

              look for, we  eventually find at the expense of  closing our senses to

              see  what really  is.  Perhaps  it is  true that the  most foolish are

              those who lay claim to knowledge for they have closed their minds 

              to further  learning, and  that  the most  wise  are those  who  claim

              knowledge of no thing, that they may learn all. 

                


                                                                                1468
