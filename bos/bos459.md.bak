              FULL MOON RITUAL
              October 12, 1992
              Led by Baba Yaga (Grandmother Owl) with Shadow Hawk and Rilla

              (1-3,Baba Yaga) I also wanted to remind everyone that if you are
              someone who feels
              ...
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) that Columbus isn't your A#1 hero, we can put in a
              polite bow to the
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) residents of Turtle Island were here to greet him.
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) The strange words you'll see in the ritual are Chero-
              kee for the
              Spirit
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) guardians of the Quarters, the God, Goddess and
              Ancestors/Community/Totems.

              (1-1,S.H.) striking chime once

              (1-1,S.H.) Relax your bodies, feel the tension flow out of them....
              (1-1,S.H.) send your awareness down, down, into your feet...
              (1-1,S.H.) and from your feet, feel the connection to the earth
              pulling at you
              (1-1,S.H.) slowly, begin to breath deep...
              (1-1,S.H.) and with each breath you take, fill your body with en-
              ergy...
              (1-1,S.H.) and with each exhale, push it down through your feet into
              the earth...
              (1-1,S.H.) the connection grows stronger, and the barriers break down
              (1-1,S.H.) breath by breath, wall by wall, and the earth becomes alive
              (1-1,S.H.) beneath you.
              (1-1,S.H.) Now, as you inhale, let the energy flow completely through
              you into the
              earth...
              (1-1,S.H.) and as you exhale, begin to pull energy from the earth up
              into your
              body...
              (1-1,S.H.) you are awash in the energies of Father Sky and Mother
              Earth, they
              (1-1,S.H.) are cleansing and balancing your body with each breath you
              take.
              (1-1,S.H.) Air and Earth, you are balancing, you are grounding, you
              are 
              (1-1,S.H.) attaining peace and harmony with our Mother and our Father-
              ...
              (1-1,S.H.) Breath gently, and be at one.

              (1-3,Baba Yaga) (moving to the east and raising my athame high)

              (1-3,Baba Yaga) This athame is the symbol of Air, the element of the
              East. 
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) I summon the powers of the East, the winds of thought
              and
              intelligence,...
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) the storms of inspiration and learning. Here arises
              Awahili, the



                                                                                2157

              Eagle,...
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) where the sun does ever shine. Give to us the wisdom
              of the east.
              ...
              (1-3,Baba Yaga) We invite these spirits to this our celebration of
              their powers.

              (1-1,S.H.) (moving to the South)
              (1-1,S.H.) (taking breath, and raising Wand high)

              (1-1,S.H.) This Wand is the symbol of Fire, the Element of the South. 
              I
              (1-1,S.H.) summon the powers of the South, the fires of directed will,
              of
              (1-1,S.H.) energy and spirit.  Here dwells Tsistu, the Rabbit, the
              Trickster
              (1-1,S.H.) in the direction we are always facing.  Grant us the
              ability to
              (1-1,S.H.) attune ourselves to the energy of the South.  We invite
              these
              (1-1,S.H.) Spirits to lend us their aid in our work tonight.

              West. ...

              our inner

              North.  We

              trees, the



                                                                                2158

              from

              EXPLANATORY NOTES

              Awahili is Cherokee for Eagle, the spirit keeper of the East. This is
              the messenger
              to the powers and the bird of the chieftain.

              Sistu is Cherokee for Rabbit. the spirit keeper of the South for the
              Eastern
              Woodland Indians. Western Indians use the Coyote her. In any case it
              represents
              teaching through humor or by showing how NOT to do things. Think of
              the B'rer Rabbit
              stories: "Please 
              don thro me in dat briar patch!"



                                                                                2162

              Yanu is Cherokee for Bear, the spirit keeper of the West. Yanu is the
              healer, she
              who gave the sweat lodge to the people and the bear is the chief of
              the council of
              the four-leggeds. The thunders are 'chancy' powers, sometimes good and
              sometimes
              evil.

              Yunsu is Cherokee for Buffalo, the spirit keeper of the North. Yes,
              buffalo once
              roamed a lot of the East! The buffalo provides for our mundane needs
              with food,
              clothing, shelter and, in the planes, fuel. For the Sioux (Lakota) the
              buffalo also
              gives the sacred pipe to the people, their communication with the
              powers.
