                                                  Magickal Reveries 
                       Dedicated to Bill Heidrick 
                       ...who opened the door... 
                        
                        
                       I am as the Moon 
                       Our Light is ever changing 
                       Healing, gathering

                       As Capricorn begins the year darkly 
                       From the depths of light 
                       As the distant Sun 
                       Begins Her Northward Path 
                        
                       Saturn begins her leaden rainbow dance 
                       Giving form to time 
                       The Gates to Formlessness 
                       Make way for new forms 
                        
                       To emerge out of Saturnian Black 
                       Gates of Formlessness 
                       Are now used by wise souls 
                       Seeking Endlessness 
                        
                       As new forms dance in, wise souls may dance out 
                       To Eternity 
                       To explore timeless states 
                       And spaceless being 
                        
                       Saturn planet of time and timelessness 
                       Space and spacelessness 
                       Of limits and freedom 
                       Is our leaden key 
                        
                       To the golden place of immortality 
                       The Bliss of Saturn 
                       Is sweet, rich bliss, indeed 
                       In dark Capricorn 
                        
                       Agape is subtle wine, holy...pure 
                       While Chubby Eros 
                       Is a belching beer 
                       Good old, sad old lust 



                      
                     Is Thelema will with desire charged 
                       Is Thelema greed 
                       Drunk on yeasty-rich lust 
                       Rapine in her heart 
                       Or is Thelema subtle will, divine 
                       Heaven's Spirit scent 
                       Beyond sight, will or mind 
                       Like good Christian Faith 
                        
                       As Capricorn begins the year darkly 
                       From the depths of light 
                       As the distant Sun 
                       Begins Her Northward Path 
                        
                       Saturn begins her leaden rainbow dance 
                       Giving form to time 
                       The Gates to Formlessness

                       Is sweet, rich bliss, indeed 
                       In dark Capricorn 
                        
                       Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                       Enfold me within 
                       Protect me, Mother, 
                       In my loneliness 
                        
                       Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                       Enfold me within 
                       Lead me to earthly love 
                       Lead me to my Self 
                        
                       Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                       Enfold me within 
                       Surround me with lovers 
                       Who heal me with love 



                      
                     Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                       Enfold me within 
                       Allow me loving friends 
                       Who heal me with love 
                       Isis spread your loving wings over me

                       Lead me to earthly love 
                       Lead me to my Self 
                        
                       When bright spark was struck at dark equinox 
                       Hard clarity came 
                       As Sun struck Saturn 
                       In His Earthy home 
                        
                       The Astral Year begins in Saturn's house 
                       In chill mystery 
                       The leaden wheel begins 
                       Her twelve month circle 
                        
                       From Earth to Air to Water to Fire 
                       Then again begin 
                       Spinning wheel of magick 
                       Through time and through space 
                        
                       Twelve stations of the Elemental Cross 
                       Break the calender 
                       Wear tattered calender 
                       Like torn beggar's rags 
                        
                       Twelve mundane months slip over Heaven's Year 
                       Solstice to solstice 
                       Tearing the paper year 
                       With ancient power 
                        
                       Now the dark solstice has come and has gone 
                       Year is born anew 
                       New Year's day ahead 
                       Surly overlay 
                        
                       Vying with our more ancient starry year 
                       The New Roman Year 
                       Trys hard to hide the Gods 
                       Nor can it hide them 
                        
                       For their power is born ever anew 
                       Through the twelve stations 
                       And deep in each month 
                       Their Life births Magick 
                        
                       As Virgo dies the dark Crone encroaches 
                       Hard with Grey Power 
                       Harsh-shrivelled with Wisdom 
                       Of a long chaste life 



                      
                     What seems to be ugly, mean grows in strength 
                       Like a walnut shell 
                       Wrinkled shell, wrinkled nut 
                       Wrinkled wise, old brain 
                       Cruel Death mercifully releases Beauty 
                       Libra roses rise 
                       Gentle Autumn breezes 
                       Pink, red, soft petals 
                        
                       From peak to craggy peak the Horn'd One leaps 
                       Fire in his eyes 
                       Hard shouldered...white-hot chest 
                       Antlered man on high 
                        
                       Blue lightening flashes from his bright-hot thighs 
                       Swift knees crash through trees 
                       In the ancient forest 
                       Of my ancient mind 
                        
                       From those depths my ancient powers rise 
                       Fire in my eyes 
                       Soft heart hardens.  Wisdom 
                       Surges in my thighs 
                        
                       Knees and ankles loosen, muscles tighten 
                       I am the Horn'd One! 
                       I am He!  I am Free! 
                       Ancient One in me! 
                        
                       Affirmation:  I am Pan!  I am Cernunnos!  I am the Horn'd        One.   I am
                Shiva!  I am He!  I am Atman!  I am Free! 
                        
                        
                       Is Peace possible on Battlefield Earth 
                       No.  Not now, Kali 
                       Your Yuga demands War 
                       War is our teacher 
                        
                       Only through War can we learn to escape 
                       Your prison of Time 
                       The only Peace there is 
                       Is hidden within 
                        
                       Each individual heart.  Turn within 
                       Make that your War 
                       Exploit the Battlefield 
                       By turning away 
                        
                       That is War enough in Kali's prison 
                       Of Time and of Space 
                       Learn to reverse the Field 
                       And find your own Peace 
                        


                                                                                               1885
