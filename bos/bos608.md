BLOODSTONE

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Bloodstone is a member of the Chalcedony
family.It is a variety of quartz (silicon dioxide) often with some iron
and aluminum. The chemistry is SiO2. It is dark, bright green spotted
with red inclusions. The streak is white. This is considered a microcry-
stalline variety of quartz and is not found in crystal form.

ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally
near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are
relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and
massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in
chemical sedimentary rocks.

OCCURENCE: India, Germany.

NAME: This stone is also referred to as &quot;heliotrope,&quot; which is derived
from two Greek words which signify &quot;sun-turning&quot;. It was given this name
because of a notion that when immersed in water it would turn the sun
red. Chalcedony is derived from Chalcedon, an ancient Greek city of Asia
Minor.

LEGEND and LORE: This is one of the birthstones for March.

    &quot;Who in this world of ours, her eyes
    In March first opens, shall be wise.
    In days of peril, firm and brave,
    And wear a Bloodstone to her grave.&quot; (5)

Ancient warriors often carried an amulet of bloodstone which was
intended to stop bleeding when applied to a wound.

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Because it is green, it can be used for &quot;money
spells&quot;. It is also considered a &quot;lucky&quot; stone for atheletes because it
imparts courage and stamina.

HEALING: Heliotrope is used today in conjunction with anything having to
do with blood.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:I consider the ancient uses of bloodstone in line
with what I use it for today. In addition, I consider it a &quot;cholesterol
buster&quot;, and wouldn't hesitate to apply it to any with this type of
problem. Generally I would use it at the Heart Chakra. I've also used it
successfully in situations where I needed &quot;courage&quot; to accomplish
something. I will just carry a piece of it in my pocket for this
purpose.

NOTE: Chrysoprase, carnelian, jasper and agate are all forms of
Chalcedony.

 an interesting experiment (BLOODSTONE cont.)
.......................................................................-
This is more about bloodstone, but I didn't want to include it in the
main text.  Read on, and you'll see why...

A few years ago, I had a discussion with my daughter (who was about 13
at the time) about the &quot;spiritual essence&quot; of plants and stones. I
explained to her that different people &quot;see&quot; this spiritual essence in
various forms. Somehow, this led to a discussion of &quot;devas&quot;, which she
interpreted as &quot;people, but without a body that we can see with mundane
eyes.&quot;

A few days later, I was reading a novel, reposed on the sofa in my
livingroom.  She was sitting on the floor by the coffee table, drawing
in her sketchbook with her pastels.

On the coffee table were several stones in a dish. One was an amethyst,
one a bloodstone, one was some yellow/green crystal that someone had
loaned to me because they wanted my &quot;impressions&quot; ...and there were some
others that I don't remember now.

I glanced over at my daughter, and she was holding one of the stones in
her hands, with her eyes closed. She apparently had achieved some form
of &quot;altered state&quot; because her little eyeballs were just wigglin' away
(REM).

A while later, I glanced over, and she was drawing a portrait. After she
seemed finished and satisfied with what she was doing, I questioned her
about it. She said she was drawing the &quot;spirit/deva&quot; of the stones in
the dish.

The one for bloodstone was an elf-like, male person. He had dark/black
hair, green, slanted eyes, &quot;Spock&quot; eyebrows, and pointed ears. Because
of the expression on his face, I asked her what she thought of him. Her
comments were:
&quot;He is very fierce. I'm kind of afraid of him, because it seems like he
is pretty strong and could get mad. He uses weapons...and can fight.&quot;

My daughter didn't know anything about the &quot;lore&quot; connected with the
stones. In addition, I found that &quot;bloodstone&quot; was very different from
any of the other &quot;stone portraits&quot; that she did...The rest were much
more &quot;human&quot;...

BROWN (PICTURE) JASPER

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Brown Jasper, sometimes called &quot;picture&quot; Jasper
because of the beautiful variations in coloring, is a type of Chal-
cedony. It is closely related to Quartz, with the chemistry of SiO2. The
color variations are from trace amounts of other minerals, usually iron
and aluminum. The hardness is 7.

ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally
near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are
relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and
massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in
chemical sedimentary rocks.

OCCURENCE: Montana, Utah and Wyoming are prolific locations for Brown
Jasper in the U.S. In addition, fine specimens have come from Brazil,
Uruguay and Egypt.  Other colors and forms of Jasper are abundant in
California, Texas and Arkansas.

NAME: The name Chalcedony is from Chalcedon, an ancient Greek city of
Asia Minor.

LEGEND and LORE: Beautiful Jasper, with light and dark brown markings
was referred to as &quot;Egyptian Marble&quot;. Various Native American tribes
used Jasper as a rubbing stone and some called it &quot;the rain bringer&quot;.

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Brown Jasper is balancing and grounding. This stone,
carved into an arrowhead, is worn to attract luck. It is a good stone to
use after completing a ritual to help you regain your center and become
grounded.

HEALING: Jasper is stabilizing. It will help to reduce insecurity, fear
and guilt.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use a piece of Montana Picture Jasper, which is
mostly brown and tan with a slight bit of sky or navy blue as a strong
grounding stone for those who have an excess of energy at the Splenic
Chakra.I've also used the stone as a basis for a &quot;journey&quot;...The stone
looks like a scene of the Rocky Mountains. Finally, I've used Picture
Jasper as a psychological tool:I will ask someone who is &quot;looking for an
answer&quot; to gaze into the stone and describe all the symbols they see.
Then I work with the client to form the &quot;symbols&quot; into some sort of
answer.

NOTES: Agate, Jasper, Flint, Sardonyx, and onyx are all forms of
Chalcedony. In addition, particular colors of Chalcedony have specific
names, such as Heliotrope, Bloodstone, Chrysophrase and Moss Agate.

CARNELIAN

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:Carnelian is the clear red to brownish red member
of the Chalcedony family. It is a microcrystalline variety of Quartz(Si-
licone Dioxide) and may contain small amounts of iron oxides. The
hardness is 7, and the streak is white.

ENVIRONMENT: Chalcedony is formed in several environments, generally
near the surface of the earth where temperatures and pressures are
relatively low. It commonly forms in the zone of alteration of lode and
massive hydrothermal replacement deposits and as bodies of chert in
chemical sedimentary rocks.

OCCURENCE: Fine carnelian comes from India and South America.

GEMSTONE INFORMATION:Carnelian is used as an alternate birthstone for
the month of May.It is normally cut into cabochons, engraved, or made
into seal stones or rounded, polished, and pierced for necklaces and
other items of jewelry.

NAME: The name means &quot;flesh-colored&quot;, from [caro], meaning &quot;genitive&quot;
and [carnis], meaning &quot;flesh&quot;.

LEGEND and LORE: Carnelian has long been associated with courage and
cleansing of the blood. It was beleived that the stone would improve
one's outlook, making the individual cheerful and expelling fears.

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Katrina Raphaell says that Carnelian can be used to
&quot;see into the past&quot;. The &quot;Crystal Oracle&quot; says that Carnelian referrs to
the Self, and Current Conditions. It is a grounding stone, and associ-
ated with the Earth.  As such, it is considered practical, sensible and
balanced. Cunningham associates the stone with the element of Fire. He
suggests it as a talisman against Telepathic invasion.

HEALING: It is recommended for infertility or impotency. In addition it
is used for purification of the blood. It has also been suggested that
this stone will stop nosebleeding.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I call this the &quot;sexy&quot; stone...since I beleive it
stimulates sexual appetites. I use it in the lower Chakras for infer-
tility and impotency for men(I use Coral as the feminine counterpart.)
I always get a good chuckle when I notice a man wearing a LARGE
Cornelian belt buckle. In addition, I would use this stone for relief of
pain from arthritis in men.

CORAL

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: CaCo3, or calcium carbonate in the form of
calcite, is the main constituent of calcareous corals; minor con-
stituents are MgCo3, or magnesium carbonate and proteinaceous organic
substances, which act as binding agents. At 2.5 to 4, the hardness is
slightly higher than that of calcite. The skeletons of corals vary in
color: from bright to dark red, slightly orange-red, pink and white.

ENVIRONMENT: In all cases, coral consists of the branching skeletons of
animals which live in colonies planted on the seabed at depths varying
from tens to hundreds of meters. They are typical of warmish to very
warm seas.

OCCURENCE: The most famous of these organisms is Corallium rubrum, which
lives in the waters of the Mediterranean and, despite its name,provides
not only red, but orange, pink, and white coral. Similar to this are
Corallium elatius, C. japonicum, and C. secundum, which maily live off
the coasts of Japan, China, Indochina, the Philippines, and other
archipelagos of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Coral colonies occupy
large areas especially in the Pacific, but also near the coast of South
Africa, in the Red Sea, and to the east of Australia.  These latter
colonies, however, consist of madrepore, which has little in common with
the corals used as ornaments.

GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Most of the coral used since antiquity as an
ornamental material comes from the calcareous skeletons of colonies of
marine organisms of the phylum Cnidaria, order Corgonacea, genus
Corallium. Corals take a good polish. They also have a certain degree of
elasticity and can be heated and bent into bangles. Thin brancehes were
and still are polished, pierced, and threaded, unaltered, into neck-
laces. Larger pieces are cut into spherical or faceted necklace beads,
pear shapes for pendant jewelry, or cabochons. It is also used for
carved pieces and small figurines, in both oriental and western
art styles. The most highly prized varities of coral are those that are
a uniform, strong bright red.

NAME: The name is derived from the Latin [corallium,] related to the
Greek [korallion].

LEGEND and LORE: The oldest known findings of red coral date from the
Mesopotamian civilization, i.e. from about 3000 BC. For centuries, this
was the coral par excellence, and at the time of Pliny the Elder it was
apparently much appreciated in India, even more than in Europe.Red coral
has traditionally been used as a protection from the &quot;evil eye&quot; and as
a cure for sterility.  One of the Greek names for Coral was Gorgeia,
from the tradition that blood dripped from the Head of Medea, which
Perseus had deposited on some branches near the sea-shore; which blood,
2609

becoming hard, was taken by the Sea Nymps, and planted in the sea. (8)

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Coral is associated with Venus, Isis and Water. It
has been used as a form of protective magic for children for hundreds of
years.  Cunningham recommends it as a luck-attractor for living
areas.Sailors use it as a protection from bad weather while at sea.
Red-orange coral is one of the four element gemstones of the Pueblo
Indians. It is one of the four colors used for the directions in the
Hopi/Zuni Road of Life. Coral is considered a representative of the warm
energy of the Sun, and the southern direction.

HEALING: Coral's healing properties are mostly associated with Women,
young children and the elderly. For women it is said to increase
fertility and regulate menstration. For young children, it is recom-
mended to ease teething and to prevent epilepsy. For the elderly, it is
used as a cure for arthritis.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use coral at the lower Chakras for &quot;Women's
Healing.&quot; In  particular, I will use it for disorders relating to female
reproductive organs.  I also use it magically, to represent female
fertility.I have used it with some success for arthritis, but only for
women. This is one of the stones that I &quot;reserve&quot; for female/feminine
use. (I use Carnelian as the &quot;male&quot; counterpart.)  I have not had an
opportunity to try it for a young child.

EMERALD

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION:Emerald is a type of Beryl, Beryllium aluminum
silicate, frequently with some sodium, lithium and cesium.It's chemistry
is Be3Al2Si6O18. Beryls range in color from Bright green (emerald),
blue, greenish blue (aquamarine), yellow (golden beryl), red, pink
(morganite) to white. The streak is colorless. It's hardness is 7-1/2 to
8. The crystals are Hexagonal and they are common. Fine emeralds have
velvety body appearance; their value lies in their even distribution of
color. Inclusions are common in emerald, but other stones of this group
are usually most valuable when free of flaws.

ENVIRONMENT: Beryl develops in pegmatites and certain metamorphic rocks.
It occurs with quartz, microcline, and muscovite in pegmatites, and with
quartz, muscovite, and almandine in schist of regional metamorphic
rocks.

OCCURENCE: Best emerald comes from Colombia.(NOTE: it is not necessary
to spend thousands of dollars for a tiny chip of emerald to add to your
healing/ magical collection. If you look around in rock shops, you may
be able to come across some &quot;less than perfect&quot; stones that aren't
faceted. I've found 4 of them, slightly larger than my fingernail and
they were about $3.00 each.)

NAME: The name is from the Greek [beryllos] indicating any green
gemstone.

LEGEND and LORE: Emerald is considered a birthstone for the month of
May.

    &quot;Who first beholds the light of day,
    In spring's sweet flowery month of May,
    And wears an Emerald all her life,
    Shall be a loved, and happy wife.&quot; (5)

MAGICAL PROPERTIES: &quot;If you wish to bring a love into your life, buy an
emerald and charge it with your magical need through your visualization,
perhaps while placing it near a green candle. After this ritual, wear or
carry the emerald somewhere near your heart. Do this in such a way that
it cannot be seen by others. When you meet a future love, you'll know it
wasn't the visible jewel that attracted him or her.&quot; (3) The Greeks
associated this stone with the Goddess Venus. It has come to represent,
for many people, the security of love.  Emerald, like allmost all of the
green stones, is also advantageous for business/money ventures.

HEALING: Emerald is said to aid perception and inner clarity. Because of
this, they are also associated with healing diseases of the eye, and
problems affecting eyesight. It was believed that emeralds could
counteract poisons and cure disentary.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:I sometimes use Emeralds in a stone layout. I will
use them for their psychological/spiritual values of clarity and
perception. If I am using them for this purpose, I use them in the area
of the Heart Chakra, in conjunction with Rose Quartz, or Rhodochrosite
for balanced energy. I've also used them for prosperity consciousness.

GARNET (PYROPE) SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Pyrope Garnets are from a group
of very closely related aluminum silicates. The Chemistry for the Pyrope
variety is Mg3Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from deep red to
reddish black and on rare occasions from purple and rose to pale
purplish red (sometimes called \[rhodolite\].) The hardness ranges
between 6-1/2 and 7-1/2. ENVIRONMENT: Pyrope occurs with olivine and
hypersthene in peridotite of plutonic rocks. OCCURENCE: Pyrope Garnets
occur in peridotite in Kentucky, Arkansas, Arizona, New Mexico, and
Utah. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, most Pyrope came
from Bohemia, where it is still found today. The main sources nowadays,
however, are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, the United States,
Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. GEMSTONE INFORMATION: The
garnet species with red or purple varieties, including Pyrope are
considered gemstones. Usually bright red, Pyrope can be a much less
attractive brick or dark red. It can be perfectly transparent, but this
feature is less visible in dark specimens. It is either made into fairly
convex cabochons, or faceted, with an oval or round mixed cut or, more
rarely, a step cut. The faceted gems have good luster, rather less
obvious in cabochons. The most valuable types are, of course, the
transparent ones with the brightest red color. Pyrope is relatively
common, although less so than almandine. Very large stones, up to
several hundred carats have been found; but these are rare and are found
in museums and famous collections. NAME: The name comes from the Greek
\[pyropos,\] meaning "fiery." The name "Garnet" comes from the Latin
\[granatus,\] meaning "seed-like". LEGEND and LORE: Pyrope Garnet has
long been associated with love, passion, sensuality and sexuality. Some
Asiatic tribes used red garnets as bullets for sling bows because they
pierced their victims quickly, and could not be seen well in the body
when they mingled with the blood. 2612 Throughout the ages, Pyrope has
been used as a curative for all types of ailments dealing with blood.
MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Pyrope is directly linked with the Will. As such, it
is a strong stone for the Magician and Shaman. It is associated with
Fire and Mars, Strength and Protection. It will help the practitioner
tap into extra energy for ritualistic purposes. HEALING: While all
Garnets are associated with the Root Chakra, Pyrope is particularly
symbolic. It is used for healing when the subject involved has "lost the
will to live", since it is directly related to the desire to live and
achieve in this lifetime. This stone warms and aids blood circulation,
rouses sexuality and heals the reproductive system and the heart.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: If you are already a strong willed individual or
have a fiery temper that you need to learn to control, I suggest that
you work with the Alamandine Garnets, rather than the Pyropes. This is a
good stone to use for treating depression. Very often, when I've
"worked" on an individual who has suffered a heart attack, I find that
the individual is rather severely depressed (which I think is a side
effect of the medication) and has lost the will to continue in this
lifetime. I've found that fiery red Pyrope Garnets are a great help in
this situation. ADDITIONAL NOTES: The Latin name \[carbunculus,\] (small
coal or ember), is attributed to all red transparent stones. It is more
often applied to Pyropes when they are formed into cabochons than any
other stone. -------bibliography------- 1. Scientific, Environment,

GARNET (ALMANDINE) SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Almandine Garnets are from a
group of very closely related aluminum silicates. The Chemistry for the
Almandine variety is Fe2/3+Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from
deep red to brown and brownish black. The hardness ranges between 6-1/2
and 7-1/2. 2613 ENVIRONMENT: Almandine occurs in diorite of plutonic
rocks, and with andalusite, hornblende, and biotite in hornfels and
schist of contact and regional metamorphic rocks. OCCURENCE: Well-formed
crystals of Almandine have come from Wrangell, SE Alaska; from Emerald
Creek, Benewah Co., Idaho; and from Michigamme, Michigan. Gemstone
quality material is obtained in large quantities from Sri Lanka and
India, where it is also cut; other sources are Burma, Brazil,
Madagascar, Tanzania, and Australia. GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Most red
garnets come under the name Almandine, even when their composition is
midway between that of Pyrope and Almandine and similar, in many cases,
to that of Rhodolite. The reason for this is the similarity in their
color and absorption spectrum characteristics. Almandine has a brilliant
luster, but its transparency is frequently marred, even in very clear
stones, by excessive depth of color. The cabochon cut is widely used,
often being given a strongly convex shape and sometimes a concave base,
in an effort to lighten the color by reducing the thickness. Rose cuts
have also been used, particularly in the past. Nowdays, when the
material is quite transpare- nt, faceted cuts are used as well, and
sometimes square or rectangular step cuts. Gems of several carats are
not uncommon. Faceted or even barely rounded pieces of Almandine,
pierced as necklace beads, were very common in the recent past, but are
now considered old-fashioned. NAME: The name Almandine comes from
\[carbunculus alabandicus,\] after the city of Alabanda in Asia Minor,
where gems were traded at the time of Pliny theElder. LEGEND and LORE:
All red Garnet has long been associated with love, passion, sensuality
and sexuality. Garnet is considered a birthstone for those born in
January: "By her in January born No gem save Garnets should be worn;
They will ensure her constancy, True friendship, and fidelity." MAGICAL
PROPERTIES: The darker Garnets are associated with the Will and the
Source of Life Incarnate. This is who and what we are in this lifetime.
This stone is worn for protective purposes, and is thought to drive off
demons and phantoms. HEALING: Almandine Garnets are used to heal skin
conditions associated with poor circulation. They improve vigor,
strength and endurance. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: Almandine Garnets are
particularly effective when healing "traumas" that are carried over from

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Spessartine Garnets are from a group of very
closely related aluminum silicates. The Chemistry for the Spessartine
variety is Mn3Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from brownish red
to hyacinth-red. The hardness ranges between 6-1/2 and 7-1/2.
ENVIRONMENT: Spessartine occurs with albite and muscovite in granite
pegmatites and with quartz and riebeckite in blue schist or regional
metamorphic rocks.. OCCURENCE: Large corroded crystals of Spessartine
have come from the Rutherford No. 2 Mine, Amelia, Amelia Co., Virginia;
crystals up to 1" in diameter have been found in several pegmatites in
the Ramona District, San Diego Co., California; sharp, dark-red,
well-formed crystals occur in cavities in rhyolite near Ely, White Pine
C., Nevada; and brilliant crystals of Spessartine have been found with
topaz at Ruby Mt., near Nathrop, Chaffee Co., Colorado. Gem material
comes from the gem gravels of Sri Lanka and Burma. It is also found in
Brazil and Madagascar. GEMSTONE INFORMATION: The gem variety of
Spessartine Garnet is uncommon. It tends to be midway between
spessartine and almandine in composition. The "aurora red", orange-red
or orange-pink color is typical. It has good transparency and
considerable luster. It is normally given a mixed, round, or oval cut.
The weight does not normally exceed a few carats. Gems of about 10
carats are extremely rare and usually of an atypical, rather dark,
unattactive color. NAME: Spessartine is named after an occurrence in the
spessart district, Bavaria, Germany. LEGEND and LORE: In the 13th
century garnets were thought to repel insect stings. A magical treatise,
"The Book of Wings", dating from the thirteenth century says "The
well-formed image of a lion, if engraved on a garnet, will protect and
preserve honors and health, cures the wearer of all diseases, brings him
honors, and guards him from all perils in traveling." MAGICAL
PROPERTIES: Spessartine is normally considered to be red-orange to
orange-pink. Thus it links the "will" with the "desire". It is a good
stone to use when casting a spell for your "heart's desire", especially
if it is of the orange-pink" variety. 2615 HEALING: The orange garnets
are linked to the root and the belly chakra. They are beneficial in
instances of infertility, dealing with reproduc- tive organs. Mentally,
it inspires confidence in personal creativity and self-worth. PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE: Spessartine is not as effective as Carnelian for instances
of infertility. But it DOES help the mental attitude of the individual
experiencing the difficulty. It is a warming stone, and works well for
increasing circulation in the lower part of the body.

SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Grossular Garnets are from a group of very
closely related calcium silicates. The Chemistry for the Grossular
variety is Ca3Al2Si3O12. These Garnets range in color from yellow, pink
and brown through white and colorless. The hardness ranges between 6-1/2
and 7-1/2. ENVIRONMENT: Grossular occurs with wollastonite, calcite, and
vesuviani- te in hornfels of contact metamorphic rocks. OCCURENCE: Being
the commonest of all garnets, it is found in a variety of locations.
Fine colorless crystals up to 1/2" across occur in Gatineau and Magantic
Cos., Quebec, fine lusterous pale brown crystals 2616 up to 3" across
were found near Minot, Androscoggin Co., Main, and beautiful white and
pick crystals up to 4" across have been found near Xalostoc, Morelos,
Mexico. GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Grossular also has the typical crystal
form of garnets, occuring in isolated crystals which are often complete,
in the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron, sometimes combined with a
trapezo- hedron. They vary from transparent to semiopaque. The typical
color is light (gooseberry) yellowish green; but they can be a strong to
bluish green, honey yellow or pinkish yellow, or even colorless. When
transpar- ent, the crystals have good luster. Like other garnets, they
have no cleavage. The greenish to yellowish varieties are used as gems.
Grossular is not a rare mineral. The types used as gems mainly come from
the gem gravels of Sri Lanka (honey yellow variety); the the United
States, Canada, Mexico, Madagascar, Kenya. The green variety of
grossular garnet, discovered a few decades ago and found mainly in
Kenya, near the Tsavo National Park, is also known as Tsavorite (or
Tsavolite) It is a light, verdant, or dark green, similar to the color
of the better green tourmalines and sometimes, it is said, even
comparable to African emerald. It has good luster. These gems, which are
usually given a round or pear-shaped mixed cut, or occasionally a
brilliant cut, are generally small, rarely exceeding one carat and never
more than a few carats. NAME: Grossular is from the New Latin
\[grosssularia,\] "gooseberry," because some Grossular crystals are pale
green like the fruit. LEGEND and LORE: I do not find anything referring
specifically to yellow or green garnets in my sources. MAGICAL
PROPERTIES: While deep red garnets focus on "Will" and orange-- red
garnets focus on "Desire", yellow garnets are focused on Personal Power
and Personality. In addition they are (because of their color)
associated with athletic prowess and Oriental philosophies. HEALING:
Being linked to the Solar Plexus Chakra, yellow garnets are energizing.
They can be used for the digestive organs, the diaphram (and the breath)
and eyesight. Green garnets center their healing on the Heart Chakra.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: It is difficult to find a green stone that works
well for the lower chakras and the lower half of the body. When I do
total layouts for individuals with Aids, I use all green stones,
whenever possible. The Green garnets work well for this. Since Garnet is
the stone of the Root Chakra, the Will, and green is the color of the
Heart Chakra, love, circulation, general healing, this stone works
exceptionally well. I find that the yellow garnets work better for
magical purposes than healing. For healing, there are several yellow
stones that seem to work better for me. NOTES: Garnets are used in
industry as an abrasive. -------bibliography------- 1. Scientific,

(LAPIS LAZULI) SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Lazurite is a silicate of sodium
calcium and aluminum, with some sulfur. It is a member of the sodalite
group. It's chemistry is (Na, Ca)8(Al,Si)12O24(S,SO)4. The color ranges
in shades of blue from violet blue and azure blue thru greenish-blue.
Lazurite is distinguished from sodalite by its deeper color and fine
grain. It is also softer and lighter in weight than lazulite. It is dull
to greasy and the streak is pale blue. The hardness ranges between 5 and
5-1/2. ENVIRONMENT: Crystals are rare. It is usually granular, compact,
massive. It forms in association with pyrite, calcite, and diopside in
hornfels of contact metamorphic rocks. The opaque, vivid blue, light
blue, greenish-blue, or violet-blue stone, consisting largely of
lazurite but with appreciable amounts of calcite, diopside, and pyrite,
is a rock called \[lapis lazuli.\] The stone is usually veined or
spotted. Its value depends largely upon excellence and uniformity of
color and absence of pyrite, although some purchasers prefer lapis with
pyrite. OCCURRENCE: Lazurite is a rare mineral in North America, but it
does occur on Italian Mt. in the Sawatch Mts. of Colorado; on Ontario
Peak in the San Gabriel Mts., Los Angeles Co., and in Cascade Canyon in
the San Bernardino Mts., San Bernardino Co., California. The finest
lapis lazuli has come from Badakshan in Afghanistan, and less valuable
material has come from Russia and Chile. NAME: The name is from the
Arabic \[lazaward\], "heaven," which was also applied to sky-blue lapis
lazuli. 2618 LEGEND and LORE: Lapis Lazuli was a favorite stone of the
ancient Egyptians. In the past Lazurite has been burned and ground to
form the pigment "ultramarine." It was consider an aid to childbirth,
and has long been associated with altered states of consciousness and
trance work. Lapis is sometimes designated as a birthstone for December,
although turquoise is most common. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: To quote
Cunningham: "This stone is used in rituals designed to attract spiritual
love. Take an untumbled piece of lapis with a sharp edge. Empower the
stone and a pink candle with your need for love. Then, using the lapis
lazuli, carve a heart onto the candle. Place the stone near the
candleholder and burn the candle while visualizing a love coming into
your life." Actually, the most important magical aspect of lapis is it's
ability to strengthen psychic awareness. Cunningham says "Despite its
somewhat high price, lapis lazuli is one stone every stone magician
should own and utilize."(2) HEALING: This stone is used at the Ajina,
the Brow Chakra. It's related gland is the pituitary. The pituitary
gland is also referred to as the "master gland" because it regulates all
of the others. This location is also the center for the eyes, ears, nose
and brain. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I don't often use Lapis for physical
healing, unless I feel that there is a "link" between what is manifested
as disease, and some conflict of the "higher self". I have used it for
brain disorders (tumors, inflammation, etc.) More often, I use it in
layouts where the client is trying to achieve an altered state of
consciousness. -------bibliography------- 1. Scientific, Environment,

-------------------------------------------------- LEPIDOLITE SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION: Lepidolite a potassium, lithium, aluminum fluorsilicate
mica. Its chemistry is complex: K(Li,Al)3(Si,Al)4O10- (F,OH)2. It is
pink, lilac, yellowish, grayish white or a combination of all of these.
The streak is colorless. It is one of the softer stones, with a hardness
of 2-1/2 to 3. ENVIRONMENT: Lepidolite is confined to granite
pegmatites, where it occurs either as fine-granular masses near the core
of the pegmatite or as stubby or tabular crystals in cavities. It is
commonly associated with microcline, quartz, and tourmaline. 2619
OCCURENCE: Large fine masses of lepidolite have been mined at the
Stewart Pegmatite at Pala, and superb sharp crystals have been obtained
from the Little Three Pegmatite near Ramona, both in San Diego Co.,
California. It has also been mined in substantial amounts in several New
England states and in the Black Hills of South Dakota. NAME: The name
comes from the Greek \[lepidos\], meaning 'scale', in allusion to the
scaly aggregates in which the mineral commonly occurs.
................................................................................
2620 LEGEND and LORE: Lepidolite is a stone that could certainly be con-
sidered "new age" in the sense that it is just now coming into recogni-
tion by healers and magicians. There is no "past lore" on this stone, to
the best of my knowledge. Part of this may be due to the fact, that it
is native to the United States. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: "This stone soothes
anger, hatred or any other negative emotion. To quiet the entire house,
place lepidolite stones in a circle around a pink candle." (2) HEALING:
Lepidolite is also know as the "Dream Stone". It will protect the
individual from nightmares, especially those caused by stress or an
upset in personal relationships. It can be used in the same types of
circumstances as Kunzite, namely for manic depression or schizophrenia.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: This is one of the most soothing and relaxing
stones I've ever held. It is a beauty to look at, and calms the mind
enabling it to concentrate on the TRUE source of a problem...instead of
running around in frantic circles accomplishing nothing. The more
rubellite in the stone, the better it will help the heart and mind work
together. NOTES: Lepidolite has been used as a source of lithium. The
above description of the appearance of this stone may be deceiving, as I
found Cunningham's to be, also. All of the specimens of this stone that
I have seen so far have been grey to a pale lavendar grey with
"sparkles" of the lithium mica embedded in it. The heart-shaped cabuchon
that I have also has very distinctive crystals of rubellite (pink
tourmaline) and veins of white running through it. I was originally
looking for a MUCH brighter lavendar stone. It is unusual, also, to find
specimens that are cut and polished. Usually the stone is too "crumbly"
to take a good polish. However, it is equally handsome in rough form.

------------------------------------------------------ MALACHITE
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Malachite is a basic copper carbonate. It's
chemistry is Cu2CO3(OH)2. It ranges in color from emerald green thru
grass green to shades of silky pale green. The streak is light green.
It's hardness is 3-1/2 to 4. Crystals are rare. Most gem specimens
display distinctive concentric colorbanding; (alternating dark green and
light green bands.) ENVIRONMENT: Malachite is a secondary copper mineral
and develops in the zone of alteration in massive, lode, and
disseminated hydrothermal replacement deposits. Associated minerals are
azurite, limonite, and 2621 chalcopyrite. OCCURENCE: The copper mines at
Bisbee, Chochise Co., Arizona, are famous for their fine specimens of
massive malachite and pseudomorphs of malachite after azurite. Mines at
Morenci in Greenlee Co., and at Globe in Gila Co., Arizona, have yielded
beautiful malachite specimens, of which some consist of alternating
layers of green malachite and blue azurite. Fine malachite has also come
from copper mines in California, Nevada, Utah, Pennsylvania, and
Tennessee. NAME: The name is from the Greek \[moloche\], "mallow," an
illusion to the mineral's leaf-green color. Malachite is used as an ore
of copper and as a gemstone. LEGEND and LORE: It is said that if
malachite is worn, it will break into pieces to warn the wearer of
danger. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Used to direct power towards magical goals.
Protective, especially towards children. According to Cunningham, "Small
pieces of malachite placed in each corner of a business building or a
small piece placed in the cash register draws customers. Worn during
business meetings or trade shows, it increases your ability to obtain
good deals and sales. It is the salesperson's stone." (2) HEALING: If
the malachite is of the blue-green variety, it can be associated with
the Sacral Center, or Splenic Chakra (Svadisthana). Here, it's energy
branches to the left, to the spleen. (It is intended in this position
for those who are celebate.) In addition, if it is grass-green, it can
be used at the Lumbar/Solar Plexis Center. "When the malachite is placed
at the solar plexus and a piece of green jade is placed at the heart
center and a double-terminated quartz crystal is placed between them,
people may remember events that have been blocked for years. They may
cry or scream. As these buried emotions are brought to the surface and
released, a great weight is lifted and they soon feel renewed." (3)
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I am very careful about using Malachite. It has
been my experience that the emotions that it releases can be very
powerful, to the point of overwhelming some people. On the other hand,
if the individual is ready to deal with them (in a "growth" period) it
may work out just fine. You could "balance" the emotional content with a
pink stone (such as rose quartz) to cut down some on the intensity. A
few years ago, I broke my arm. To do so, I damaged the muscles and
nerves in my wrist. I was in a lot of pain, and was searching for what I
could do to help the situation. During a journey, I saw malachite, so I
found a malachite heart which I held in the palm of the broken arm while
meditating. I got a lot of relief from it. Now, if the wrist acts up, I
use the heart, taped over the wrist area when I go to bed at night. It
seems to help quite a bit. I now recommend malachite for nerve/muscle
damage with some success. (4) -------bibliography------- 1. Scientific,

Star. -------------------------------------------------- MOONSTONE
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Moonstone is one variation of Orthoclase. It
owes its beautiful silvery to bluish sheen ('adularescence' or 'schil-
ler') to its composition of extremely thin plates of orthoclase and
albite. The thinner these plates are, the bluer is the sheen. There are
also moonstones consisting mainly of albite. These are less translucent,
but they can occur in a variety of colours: grey, blue, green, brown,
yellow and white. There are also moonstone cat's-eyes. The chemical
composition is KAlSi3O8 and the hardness is 7. The streak is white.
ENVIRONMENT: The potash feldspars are important rock-forming minerals in
plutonic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. Adularia and sanidine are
found usually in volcanic rocks. OCCURENCE: The main countries of origin
are Ceylon, southern India (the district near Kangayam), Tanzia and
Malagasy which, together with Burma, produces some of the finest stones
with a deep blue schiller. White adularia crystals up to 2.5 cm (1")
across have been found in gold-bear- ing quartz veins at Bodie, Mono
Co., California, and in the silver mines of the Silver City district,
Owhyee Co., Idaho. GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Moonstone is always cut into
cabochons, to display the cat's-eye, or schiller. NAME: Adularia
(another name for Moonstone) comes from the locality in Switzerland, the
Adula Mts. LEGEND and LORE: This stone has always been revered because
of its lunar attraction. It was believed that the shiller in the stone
would follow the cycles of the moon. (Becoming greatest when the moon
was full.) In addition, it has always been considered a "feminine, or
Goddess" stone. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Meditation with moonstone calls into
consciousness the three-form moon phase goddesses, Diana/Selene/Hecate,
the waxing, Full and waning Moon. These are woman as goddess in her ages
and contradictions, Maiden/Mother/Crone. Cunningham favors this stone
for spells involving love. In addition he has a longish essay on using
it for a "diet" stone. HEALING: Because of it's feminine nature,
Moonstone has long been considered a "womans healing stone". It is used
traditionally for healing/balancing of female organs and hormones.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: I use Moonstone at the Transpersonal Point, for
connection to the Goddess and Universal Feminine Energy. This is the
connection to dreams and dreaming, feminine "intuition", and "cycles".
There are cycles of time, seasons, the moon, stars, etc. I also use/give
2623 this stone for those clients who are having difficulty being in
tune with the feminine side of their nature. (Everyone has a masculine
and a feminine side.) NOTES: In the past, this stone has also been
called "Cylon Opal". -------bibliography------- 1. Scientific,

Fernie, M.D. ----------------------------------------------- OBSIDIAN
SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Obsidian occurs as volcanic lava flows that are
thick and of limited area. Its black, glassy, lustrous, and often
flow-banded appearance makes it rather easy to distinguish from the
other volcanic rocks with which it is commonly associated. This mineral
forms when a silica-rich magma of granitic composition flows onto the
earth's surface, where it solidifies before minerals can develop and
crystallize. It is, therefore, an amorphous solid or glass rather than
an aggregate of minerals. The hardness of Obsidian is between 6 and 7;
it will scratch window glass. Although generally black, it is more or
less smoky along translucent to transparent edges; other colors are
gray, reddish brown, mahogany and dark green. When it has small white
"flower" designs in it, it is called Snowflake Obsidian. It is also
possible to find pieces with a sheen, or chatoyance. This is often
called Rainbow Obsidian. ENVIRONMENT: Obsidian is an environment for
very few minerals. Lithophy- sae and spherulites may contain small but
beautiful crystals of feldspar, tridymite, and cristobalite. OCCURENCE:
Some locations of Obsidian bodies are California (Inyo, Imperial, and
Modoc Cos.), Oregon (Crater Lake), Wyoming (Yellowstone Park), and
Mexico (near Pachuca.) 2624 NAME: The name is dervied from the latin
name for the mineral, \[obsio.\] LEGEND and LORE: Polished pieces of
black Obsidian have been used for Scrying. Primitive peoples once valued
obsidian highly, chipping and flaking it into knives, spearheads, and
many other implements with razor-sharp edges resulting from the
intersecting conchoidal fractures. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Obsidian is a
very protective stone. It is also associated with the inner mysteries of
the Goddess, symbolizing entrance to the labyrinth, the womb or the
subconscious self. HEALING: Because of its protective qualities,
Obsidian is a good stone for those who are soft-hearted and gentle. It
will help to guard them against abuse. This stone cleanses toxins from
the liver, so it is also good for people who are exposed to
environmental pollutants. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: This is the "balance"
stone for Clear Quartz Crystals. We jokingly refer to it around here as
a "dark sucker"...mean- ing it will absorb all sorts of negative things.
It is also a grounding stone, and I use it at the Base Chakra (below the
feet) at the beginning of a layout to keep my client "grounded". In
India, the women wear obsidian toe rings for the same purpose. I use
Black Obsidian in conjunction with Quartz. If I'm not using Clear
Quartz, I use Snowflake Obsidian. I also have a piece of Rainbow
Obsidian, but it is relatively new and I haven't finished "conversing"
with it, so I have no advice as to how to use it...at the moment.

---------------------------------------------- OPAL SCIENTIFIC
INFORMATION: Opal is hydrous silica, often with some iron and aluminum.
Its chemistry is SiO2.nH2O; amount of water varies up to 10 percent. It
ranges in color from White, yellow, red, pink, brown to gray, blue and
even colorless. It is most easily recognized by its rich internal play
of colors (opalescence). Its hardness ranges from 5-1/2 to 6-1/2. It is
vitreous and pearly. The streak is white. It is not found in crystal
form, rather is is usually massive, botryoidal, reniform, stalactitic,
and/or earthy. ENVIRONMENT: Opal is a low-temperature mineral and
usually develops in a wide variety of rocks as cavity and fracture
fillings. It requently develops as amygdules in basalt and rhyolite of
volcanic rock and replaces the cells in wood and the shells of clams.
2625 OCCURENCE: Common opal is widespread and can be readily obtained at
many places, but localities for precious opal are rare and seem to
localized in W United States and Mexico. Magnificent examples of
opalized wood can be found in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and
Washington, and lively green fluorescing opal (hyalite) occurs in seams
in pegmatites in New England and North Carolina and in cavities in
basalt near Klamath Falls, Oregon. Beautiful precious opal, as a
replacement in wood, has been obtained in Virgin Valley, Humboldt Co.,
Nevada. Excellent fire and precious opal occur in laval flows in N
Mexico. Nevada, Australia, and Honduras are sources for black opal;
Australia and Czechoslovakia for white opal; Mexico and SW United States
for fire opal. GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Black, dark blue, dark green opal
with dark gray body color and fine play of colors is called \[black
opal;\] opal with white or light body color and fine play of color is
called \[white opal;\] and transparent to translucent opal with body
color ranging from orange-yellow to red and a play of colors is called
\[fire opal.\] Play of colors depends upon interference of light and is
not dependent upon body color. Black opal is the most highly prized, and
fire opal is the most valued of the orange and red varieties. Most opal
is fashioned into cabochons, but some fire opals are faceted. NAME: The
word is from the Sanskrit \[upala,\] meaning "precious stone." LEGEND
and LORE: Opal is a birthstone for October. "October's child is born for
woe, And life's vicissitudes must know; But lay an Opal on her breast,
And hope will lull those foes to rest." (5) Opals have traditionally
been considered "lucky" stones...but only for those born in the month of
October. It has been considered bad luck to wear them if you were born
in any other month. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Opal is considered to be able to
confer the gift of invisibility on its wearer. To accomplish this,
Cunningham says "The gem was wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and carried for
this purpose." He also says, "Opals are also worn to bring out inner
beauty. A beauty spell: Place a round mirror on the altar or behind it
so that you can see your face within it while kneeling. Place two green
candles on eithe side of the mirror. Light the candles. Empower an opal
with your need for beauty -- while holding the stone, gaze into your
reflection. With the scalpel of your visualization, mold and form your
face (and your body) to the form you desire. Then, carry or wear the
opal and dedicate yourself to improving your appearance." (2) HEALING:
Opals contain all the colors of the other stones, thus, it could be used
in place of any of them. (They are akin to quartz crystals, in this
aspect.) Generally speaking, Opal is used more frequently for healing
the spirit, rather than the physical body. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: Opals
are probably my favorite stone. This may be partially due to the fact
that they are my birthstone, and I have been surrounded by them all of
my life. For me, they are protective and invigorating. I normally use
them during Journeying, and when doing "readings" for other...anything
where I am using altered states of consciousness. I find that they help

----------------------------------------------------- VESUVIANITE
(IDOCRASE) SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION: Vesuvianite is composed of calcium,
magnesium and aluminum silicate, often with some beryllium and fluorine.
The chemistry is Ca10Mg2Al4(SiO4)5(Si2)7)2(OH)4. Specimens range from
brown and green to a rare yellow or blue. The hardness is 6-1/2.
ENVIRONMENT: Vesuvianite forms by igneous and metamorphic processes. It
commonly is metamorphic and occurs with grossular, wollastonite, and
calcite in hornfels of contact metamorphic rocks; with chromite and
magnetite in serpentinite of hydrothermal metamorphic rocks; and with
wollastonite, andradite, and diopside in carbonatites. OCCURENCE:
Gem-quality Vesuvianite has been obtained from a pegmatite in marble
near Sixteen Island Lake, Laurel, Argenteuil Co., Quebec, and beautiful
micromount cyrstals of purplish-pink color occur in massive Vesuvianite
at the Montral chrome pit at Black Lake, Megantic Co., Quebec. The blue
variety called \[cyprine\] has been obtained at Franklin, Sussex Co.,
New Jersey. Fine crystals up to 1-1/2 inches across occur in pale-blue
calcite at Scratch Gravel, near Helena, Lewis and Clark Co., Montana,
and spectacular material of similar nature occurs at quarries near
Riverside, California. Beautiful pale-green massive Vesuvianite
(\[californite\]) occurs in California at Pulga, Butte Co., and near
Happy Camp, Siskiyou Co., and crude yellow prismatic crystals occur with
grossular at Xalostoc, Morelos, and Lake Jaco, Chihuahua, Mexico.
GEMSTONE INFORMATION: Translucent gray to green or nearly colorless
Vesuvianite with green streaks is called \[californite\], and is often
sold as "California Jade." Californite is fashioned into cabochons.
Principal sources are the USSR, Italy, Canada and California. NAME: The
name "Vesuvianite" is from the original locality at Mt. Vesuvius, Italy.
The alternate name, "idocrase," comes from the Greek \[eidos,\] "form",
and \[krasis,\] "mixture," because Vesuvianite may appear to combine the
crystal forms of several other minerals. 2627 LEGEND and LORE: None
found. MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Dolfyn associates this stone with Passion,
enthus- iasm, warmth and devotion. HEALING: No specific information
found, other than what Dolfyn states. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: None. I do
not have a specimen of Vesuvianite. -------bibliography------- 1.
