                                      Computer Blessing  
           
           
          Blessings on this fine machine,   
          May its data all be clean.   
          Let the files stay where they're put,   
          Away from disk drives keep all soot.   
          From its screen shall come no whines,   
          Let in no spikes on power lines.   
          As oaks were sacred to the Druids,   
          Let not the keyboard suffer fluids.   
          Disk Full shall be nor more than rarity,   
          The memory shall not miss its parity.   
          From the modem shall come wonders,   
          Without line noise making blunders.   
          May it never catch a virus,   
          And all its software stay desirous.   
          Oh let the printer never jam,   
          And turn my output into spam.   
          I ask of Eris, noble queen,   
          Keep Murphy far from this machine.
