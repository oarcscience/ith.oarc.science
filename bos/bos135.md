                               THE HOLY FOOL: 
                         The Third member of the Triad 
                          -some musings by: the Bard 
          
                                       * 
          
         "Remember, the Moon is only half as big as the Earth, but it's twice as 
          far away." 
                                                                      -Anonymous 
                                       * 
          
                 After some time musing on the concept of Goddess/God that is  
           common in Wiccan (and most Neo-Pagan groups) and seeing the common  theme
         of "things come in threes" in these belief systems, I fell to wondering  
         "Why only the God and Goddess? If all things come in threes, where is  
         the Third Aspect that should be there?"  

                 So what is this Third Aspect? I feel it is the Holy Fool; the  
         Prometheus who is the Trickster, the God (neuter) that rolls the dice. 
         This also fills in certain holes  in neo-Pagan Theology that have  bothered
         me for some time, too.  

                 First, we need to have a quick look at the Holy Fool in religious 
         and/or cultural beliefs, both primitive and modern:  
          
               American Indian: 
                        Aztec: Ueuecoyotl 
                        Caddo: Coyote 
                        Chinook: Coyote 
                        Coos: Coyote 
                        Haida: Raven 
                        Hopi: Mudhead Kachina, Clown Kachina 
                        Kiowa: Coyote 
                        Navaho: Coyote 
                        Nez Perce: Coyote 
                        Omaha: Coyote, Rabbit, Iktinike, Orphan 
                        Pueblo: Koshare 
                        Sioux: Spider 
                        Tillamook: Coyote 
                        Tinglit: Raven 
                        Winnebago: Rabbit         
                        Zuni: Coyote 
               African: Spider, Tortoise, Rabbit, Jackal 
               Graeco/Roman: Pan, Dionysis 
               Celtic: Phooka and the like (see Irish: Fear Dearg, and a host of 
                       others. The Fool must love Ireland very much...He made so 
                       many of Itself there!) 
               Norse: Loki...-and- Balder 
               Banks Island: Clat 
               Micronesia: Nareau 
               England: Puck, Black Jack Davy 
               Christianity: "Doubting" Thomas, and The Christ Himself, in many 
                             ways....and Judas, too. 
               20th Cent. North American: Bugs Bunny, The Joker, Mr. Mxyzpltk,  
                                          Murphy, ("And Pooh is a -good- example, 
                                          too!" said Eeyore) 


                                                                                 592

               Neo-Paganism: Discordians 
               18th thru 20th Cent. Appalachian: Jack (from British Isles) 
               18th and 19th Cent. N.A. Black: Br'er Rabbit, Long John, &c. 
               German: Tyl Eulenspiegel 
               Italy: Harlequin (check out Agatha Christie's stories about 
                      "Harley Quinn." VERY interesting!) 
               Islamic: Juha, Abu Nawwas, Mullah Nasruddin, Nasreddin Khoja, 
                        Nasreddin Hodja 
               Japanese: Fox, Hotei, and the whole concept of Zen...... 
          
                 And the many, many instances of the Hero figure and his Friend in  
         most people's mythology....Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Robin Hood and Little 
         John, the Mythic Hollywood Western Hero and his ridiculous sidekick, Don
         Quixote and Sancho Panza.....and many times you see the recurrent theme of
         the Great Betrayal of the Hero, which leads to His death...and to His
         Resurrection! 

                 One immediately sees that the Fool is a universal constant in  
         folk belief, just as the Goddess and God are!  
                 (NB: I have not gotten more specific for two reasons: one, for  
         limitations of space, and two, to encourage others to do a little reading 
         on their own!)  

                 As most things, the Fool is Personified in three basic Aspects  
         that (of course) overlap with each other and with the God and Goddess.  
         The first is that of the Saviour God, the Prometheus, the Culture Hero, who
         brings Knowledge (and  -occasionally- Wisdom) to Mankind. This Aspect loves
         Mankind  with all  His Being,  and only  wishes Good.  His Good  Intentions
         sometimes fall short of His (or Mankind's) expectations,  however.
          
                         Thesecond isthat ofthe Clown,the Nerd,the Jerk,that teaches
         by his own mistakes (and who usually comes out ahead because of His own 
         Innocence.) This Aspect is mostly neutral, and is how He seems to mostly 
         manifest Himself.  

                         Butletus notforget thethird,and darker,side oftheFool, best
         exemplified by  Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker in the film version
         of "Batman." Just as the Goddess has Her Dark side (the Crone,  the
         Morrigan, &c)  and the God  has His (Odin as  Death-God) so does  the  Fool
         have a terrifying Aspect (at least, from the human point of view): Chaos
         Personified.  
          
                 This is not an Aspect to invoke, as It does not care. Period. It  
           is the ultimate  psychopath, the ultimate Spoiled Brat,  the quintessence
         of Ego-centric self-love. In some circles, it could be quite nicely named 
         Ahriman, or Shaitan, or Satan, because it fits all concepts of that 
         Middle-Eastern deity....except one: It does not care if Man worships It  or
         not. It is not in  -conflict- with the God and/or Goddess, It is  -not-  on
         the kind of power-trip  that the Judeo-Christian Satan  is represented   as
         having, it just -is-. It should be considered as neither "good" nor  
         "evil," though it can personify both or either....or neither! This is  
         confusing, but with a little thought the concept will (hopefully) come 
         clear.  


                                                                                 593

              (And, just in passing, the film  version of "Batman" is perhaps a very
         good  metaphor  for the  eternal  struggle  between the  Fool-as-Prometheus
         (Batman) and the Fool-as-Chaos (the Joker). 

                   Areyou confused? If youare, GOOD! If you arenot, keep thinking by
         not-thinking. (wha-a-a-a-a-t?) 

                   Some of thebest examples ofthe three Personifications arefound in
         the Navaho and Zuni tales of Coyote, or the Br'er Rabbit tales, or the 
         older Bugs Bunny cartoons, or even Walt Disney's Goofy. And, while speaking
         of classic animation, if you can see  any of the cartoons of the   Cannibal
         Boy and the  Mynah Bird,  do so!  It shows  not one,  but TWO  Aspects   in
         action!  

              For a look at His more serious (?) side, try J.R.R. Tolkien's 
         wonderful evocation of Tom Bombadil.....who is described as "the oldest."
         Prof. Tolkien came very close to the core of the truth with that one! 

              The Fool is your slightly daffy Uncle, that comes to visit at  
           Christmas and is  such fun to  be with, but who  seems to have  a sadness
         about  him too, that you found  out later, when you were  all grown up, was
         his slide  into alcoholism. The  Fool is  the American sit-com  "Daddy" who
         never seems to  get anything  right, but wins  out in  the end anyway.  The
         Fool is  the classic  scene of  Bugs Bunny,  floating in  a washtub in  the
         middle of the Pacific Ocean, happily singing "As Time Goes By,"  blissfully
         uncaring about his obvious predicament...one which would send  a human into
         sheer despair....knowing that something  will turn up, some   scam that  he
         can pull that  will get him out of the washtub  and into  clover again. The
         Fool is the Tarot's Fool, of course....but He is also the Hanged Man. 
          
              Do -not- invoke the  Fool unless you are ready  for literally ANYTHING
         to happen! He just  might turn you into a Large Green Frog just  to observe
         what happens......He is capricious. He is unpredictable. He is  what He is,
         and  nothing you can do will turn Him  from His Purpose,  whatever that may
         be at any given moment. He is "Murphy," and whatever  can go wrong, WILL
         go  wrong...or  right. Unless  you have  an  uncommonly flexible  mind, you
         -might- not be able to handle it! 

              He has no Festival, unless it is the Lupercal, or perhaps April Fool's
         Day,  or even New Year's  Eve, for every  day is His, as  He chooses.  Some
         have   inquired   about  the   seeming   overlap   of  functions   in   the
         Goddess/God/Fool triad, and this should be addressed here. The modern 
         Western  mind tends  to  "pigeonhole" things,  and  rigidly excludes  other
         things
         from these pigeonholes. This, I feel, is in some ways an error in thinking,
         especially about the Triad.  


                                                                                 594

              One cannot and should not "compartmentalize" the God/Fool/Goddess  
         into three rigidly separate Beings, but rather think of them as three 
         separate sources of ripples in the same Pond: the ripples interact and 
         intersect,  and  act  on  each other,  but  move  within  the same  Source,
         whatever
         That may be.  
          
                                                 -the Bard

          I wish I could list all of my sources, but if I did, it would add several 
         pages to this text, and I am trying to keep it short. I -will- recommend
         reading one  book, however, that  will give a  great insight into  the Holy
         Fool:
