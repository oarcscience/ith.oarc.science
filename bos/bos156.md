                                 THE GREAT RITE (SYMBOLIC) 
          
                 Preparation: the chalice should be filled with wine. A veil of at 
         least a yard square is needed preferably of a Goddess color such as blue, 
         green, silver, or white. 

                 The Coven, except for the High Priestess and High Priest,arrange 
         themselves around the perimeter of the circle, man and woman alternately as
         far as possible, facing the center. 

                 The High Priestess and High Priest stand facing each other in the 
         center of the circle, she with her back  to the altar, he with his back  to
         the South. 

                 The High Priest kneels before the High Priestess and gives her the 
         Five Fold Kiss; that is, he kisses her on both feet,both knees, womb, both 
         breasts, and the lips, starting with the right of each pair. he says, as he
         does this: 
          
                "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways. 
                 Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar. 
                 Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be. 
                 Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty. 
                 Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names." 
          
                         Forthekisson thelips,they embrace,lengthtolength,with their
         feet touching each others. When he reaches the womb, she spreads her arms 
         wide, and the same after the kiss on the lips. 

                         TheHighPriestess thenlays herselfdown,face upwards,with her
         arms and legs outstretched to form the Pentagram. 

                 The High Priest fetches the veil and spreads it over the High 
         Priestess's body, covering her from breasts to knees. He then kneels facing
         her, with his knees between her feet. 

                         TheHigh Priestcalls a womanwitch byname, tobring his athame
         from the altar. The woman does so and stands  with the athame in her hands,
         about a yard to the West of the High Priestess's hips and facing her. 

                         TheHigh Priestcalls amalewitch byname,to bringthe chaliceof
         wine from the altar. He does so and stands with the chalice in his hands, 
         about a yard to the East of the High Priestess's hips and facing her. 
                                                                                 657

                 The High Priest delivers the invocation: 
          
                "Assist me to erect the ancient altar, at which in days past all 
                 worshipped; 
                 The altar of all things. 
                 For in old time, Woman was the altar. 
                 Thus was the altar made and placed, 
                 And the sacred place was the point within the center of 
                 the Circle. 
                         Aswehave ofold beentaught thatthe pointwithin thecenter is 
              the origin of all things, 
                 Therefore should we adore it; 
                 Therefore whom we adore we also invoke. 
                 O Circle of Stars, 
                 Whereof our father is but the younger brother, 
                 Marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, 
                 Before whom time is ashamed, the mind bewildered, and the 
                 understanding dark, 
                 Not unto thee may we attain unless thine image be love. 
                 Therefore by seed and stem, root and bud, 
                 And leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke thee, 
                 O Queen of Space, O Jewel of Light, 
                 Continuous on of the heavens; 
                 Let it be ever thus 
                 That men speak not of thee as One, but as None; 
                 And let them not speak of thee at all, since thou art continuous. 
                 For thou art the point within the Circle, which we adore; 
                 The point of life, without which we would not be. 
                 And in this way truly are erected the holy twin pillars; 
                 In beauty and strength were they erected 
                 To the wonder and glory of all men." 
          
                         TheHigh Priestremoves theveil fromthe HighPriestess's body,
         and hands it to the woman witch, from whom he takes his athame. 

                         TheHigh Priestess risesand kneels facingthe High Priest,and
         takes  the  chalice   from  the  man  witch.  (Note   that  both  of  these
         handings-over are  done without the  customary ritual kiss.The  High Priest
         continues the invocation: 
          
                "Altar of mysteries manifold, 
                 The sacred Circle's secret point 
                 Thus do I sign thee as of old, 
                 With kisses of my lips anoint." 
          
                         The  High Priest kisses the High Priestess on the lips, and
         continues: 
          
                "Open for me the secret way, 
                 The pathway of intelligence, 
                 Beyond the gates of night and day, 
                 Beyond the bounds of time and sense. 
                 Behold the mystery aright 
                 The five true points of fellowship...." 
          
                                                                                 658

                         TheHigh Priestessholdsupthe chalice,andtheHigh Priestlowers
         the point of his  athame into the  wine. Both use both  of their hands  for
         this. The High Priest continues: 
          
                "Here where Lance and Grail unite, 
                 And feet, and knees, and breast, and lip." 
          
                         TheHigh Priesthandshis athametothe womanwitchand thenplaces
         both his hands  round those of the High Priestess as she holds the chalice.
         He kisses her, and she sips the wine; she kisses him, and he sips the wine.
         Both of them keep their hands around the chalice while they do this. 

                         TheHighPriest thentakesthechalice fromtheHighPriestess, and
         they both rise to their feet. 

                         TheHigh Priesthands thechaliceto awoman witchwitha kiss,and
         she sips. She  gives it to a man with a  kiss. The chalice is passed around
         the Coven, man to woman, with a kiss each time, until the entire  Coven has
         sipped the wine.  The chalice can be refilled and any one can drink from it
         without repeating the ritual once the chalice has gone around once. 

                         To consecratethe cakes,the woman picksup her athame,and the
         man, kneeling before  her, holds up the dish. the  woman draws the Invoking
         Pentacle of Earth in the air above the plate while the man says: 
          
                 "O Queen most secret, bless this food into our bodies; 
                  bestowing health, wealth, strength, joy and peace, 
                  and that fulfillment of love that is perfect happiness." 
          
                         The womanlaysdown herathameand passesthe cakestothe manwith
         a  kiss, he passes  them back with  a kiss  and they are  passed around the
         Coven the same way the wine was. Be sure to save some of the wine and  some
         cake  for  an offering  to  the  Earth  and  the  Little  Folk.  After  the
         meeting,leave  the offering  outside of  the house  if working  indoors, or
         behind in the woods or field, when you leave if you are working outdoors.

              THE GREAT RITE ACTUAL 
          
              Preparation:  the chalice  should be  filled with wine.  A veil  of at
         least a yard square is needed  preferably of a Goddess color such  as blue,
         green, silver, or white. 

              The  Coven, except  for  the High  Priestess  and High  Priest,arrange
         themselves around the perimeter of the circle, man and woman alternately as
         far as possible, facing the center. 

              The High  Priestess and  High Priest  stand facing  each other  in the
         center of the circle, she with her back to the altar, he with his  back  to
         the South. 

              The High  Priest kneels  before the High  Priestess and gives  her the
         Five Fold Kiss; that  is, he kisses her on both feet,both knees, womb, both
         breasts, and the lips, starting with the right of each pair. he says, as he
         does this: 
                                                                                 659

          
                "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways. 
              Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar. 
              Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be. 
              Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty. 
              Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names." 
           
              For the  kiss on the  lips, they embrace,  length-to-length,with their
         feet touching each others. When  he reaches the womb, she spreads  her arms
         wide, and the same after the kiss on the lips. 

              The  High Priestess then lays herself down, face upwards,with her arms
         and legs outstretched to form the Pentagram. 

              The  High  Priest fetches  the  veil  and  spreads it  over  the  High
         Priestess's body, covering her from breasts to knees. He then kneels facing
         her, with his knees between her feet. 

              The High Priest delivers the invocation: 
          
              "Assist me to erect the ancient altar, at which in days     past all  
                  worshipped; 
               The altar of all things. 
               For in old time, Woman was the altar. 
               Thus was the altar made and placed, 
               And the sacred place was the point within the center of the Circle. 
                As we have of old been taughtthat the point within the center is the
               origin of all things, 
               Therefore should we adore it; 
               Therefore whom we adore we also invoke. 
               O Circle of Stars, 
               Whereof our father is but the younger brother, 
               Marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, 
                Before whom  time is  ashamed, the  mind bewildered, and  the       
         understanding dark, 
               Not unto thee may we attain unless thine image be love. 
               Therefore by seed and stem, root and bud, 
               And leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke thee, 
                  O Queen of Space, O Jewel of Light, 
               Continuous on of the heavens; 
               Let it be ever thus 
               That men speak not of thee as One, but as None; 
               And let them not speak of thee at all, since thou art continuous. 
               For thou art the point within the Circle, which we adore; 
               The point of life, without which we would not be. 
               And in this way truly are erected the holy twin pillars; 
               In beauty and strength were they erected 
               To the wonder and glory of all men." 
          
              The Maiden fetches her athame from the altar and ritually opens a gate
         way in the Circle. The Coven file through and leave the room. The Maiden is
         the last one through and reseals the  Circle.  The High Priest removes  the
         veil from the High Priestess's body. 
                                                                                 660

              The High Priestess  rises and kneels facing the High  Priest. The High
         Priest continues the invocation: 
          
              "Altar of mysteries manifold, 
              The sacred Circle's secret point 
              Thus do I sign thee as of old, 
              With kisses of my lips anoint." 
          
         The High Priest kisses the High Priestess on the lips, and continues: 
          
              "Open for me the secret way, 
              The pathway of intelligence, 
              Beyond the gates of night and day, 
              Beyond the bounds of time and sense. 
              Behold the mystery aright 
              The five true points of fellowship...." 
              "Here where Lance and Grail unite, 
              And feet, and knees, and breast, and lip." 
          
              The  High Priest  and High  Priestess now  have intercourse.This  is a
         private matter between them and  none of the Coven can question  them about
         it. When they are done, one of them ritually opens the Circle and calls the
         rest  of the Coven. When  they are back in the  Circle, it is again sealed.
         The wine is now consecrated.  

              A  male witch kneels in front  of the altar before  a female witch. He
         holds up a chalice  of wine and she holds her athame  point down and lowers
         the athame into the wine. The man says: 
          
              "As the athame is to the male, so the cup is to the female; 
                  and conjoined, they become one in truth." 
          
              The woman  lays down her  athame on the altar  and kisses the  man who
         remains  kneeling and she accepts the chalice  from him. She sips the wine,
         kisses  him again and he sips, rises, and  gives it to another woman with a
         kiss. The chalice  is passed around  the Coven, man to  woman, with a  kiss
         each time, until  the entire Coven has sipped the wine.  The chalice can be
         refilled and  any one can drink  from it without repeating  the ritual once
         the chalice has gone around once.              

              To  consecrate the cakes,  the woman picks up  her athame,and the man,
         kneeling  before  her, holds  up  the dish.  The  woman draws  the Invoking
         Pentacle of Earth in the air above the plate while the man says: 
          
              "O Queen most secret, bless this food into our bodies; 
              bestowing health,  wealth, strength,  joy  and peace,  and that       
         fulfillment of love that is perfect happiness." 
          
              The woman lays down her athame and passes the cakes to  the man with a
         kiss,  he passes them back with a kiss and they are passed around the Coven
         the same way the  wine was. Be sure to save some of  the wine and some cake
         for  an offering to the Earth and  the Little Folk. After the meeting,leave
         the offering  outside of  the house  if working indoors,  or behind  in the
         woods or field, when you leave if you are working outdoors.
