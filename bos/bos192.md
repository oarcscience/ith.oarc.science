                                        Laws of Magick 
                                              by
                                         Simon Magus

         Magick,  not unlike  physics or  chemistry, operates  according to  certain
         laws.  These laws, as well as those of the sciences, reside in reality
         within  the heads of those who use them.   However, the analysis of reality
         into  artificial categories is  useful at certain  levels of investigation.
         It is well to bear in mind, nevertheless, that such categories reflect more
         the contents of the human mind than they do of whatever "reality" might  be
         out there.

         For the  following  analysis  we  are indebted  to  REAL  MAGIC  by  P.E.I.
         Bonewits.   Mr  Bonewits, incidentally,  holds the  first Bachelor  of Arts
         degree  in magic(k) ever awarded.   He, much to the  chagrin of some of the
         faculty of the University  of California, was awarded  the degree in  June,
         1970.

                                   LAW OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
         Anything done under EXACTLY the same conditions will always be associated
         with  exactly  the same  result.   This  law is  taken  for granted  in the
         sciences and in everyday  life.  The whole  concept of causation is  now on
         shaky ground,  thanks to developments in the field of quantum physics.  But
         for  practical purposes,  in magick as  well as  in our  everyday lives, we
         ignore causality  to our own  peril.  We  must assume, at least  in dealing
         with things  the size of human beings, that effects follow causes.  Even in
         the constantly flowing, changing astral realm we find the law  of cause and
         effect in full operation.
              
                                       LAW OF KNOWLEDGE
         This  law tells us that  "understanding brings control,"  that the more you
         know the more  powerful you are.  If you know all about something, you have
         total control over it.  "Knowledge is power."

                                    LAW OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE
         This is a  sub-law of the previous  law and follows from  it.  If you  know
         yourself, you control yourself.  The more you know about yourself, the
         better you can control yourself.

                                         LAW OF NAMES
         This law is related to the Law of Knowledge and to  the Law of Association.
         It  states if  one knows  the whole  and complete  name of a  phenomenon or
         entity, one  has complete control over it.  This  is one of the reasons the
         Mystery  Religions (including  Christianity) conferred  a  new name  on the
         neophyte.  His new  name was then his true  name, but it was known  only to
         his fellow members  of the mystery.  The  Law of Names also relates  to the
         Law of Personification which will be explained later.  Two premises  behind
         the present law are:  (1) Names are definitions.   This is more  obvious in
         simpler languages, but it is as true of English as of any other.  Sometimes
         the  definition is hidden in  the origin of the word,  as is often the case
         with  those derived from  Latin or Greek, but  it is there.   (2) Names are
         mnemonic (memory) devices which trigger a range of associations.   (See the
         Law of Association).
                             


                                                                                 833

                                    LAW OF WORDS OF POWER
         This is a sublaw of the Law of Names.  It states that certain words trigger
         changes  in the inner and outer realities  of the person saying them.  Many
         of these words are corruptions of the names of ancient Gods.  Words like
         "Abraxas,"  Osorronnophris,"  "Abracadabra" are  examples.    They have  no
         meaning to us today, but THEIR POWER LIES IN THE SOUNDS OF THE WORDS
         THEMSELVES.

                                      LAW OF ASSOCIATION
         If two things have something in  common (anything!), that thing can be used
         to control both.  Bell's theorem in quantum mechanics indicates that every
         particle in the Universe affects every other.  The following two sublaws,
         which anthropologists think are the basis of "primitive" magick, are more
         useful in practice.  These are the Laws of Similarity and Contagion.

                                      LAW OF SIMILARITY
         Most  people have  heard  of sympathetic  magick, which  is  based on  this
         principle.  Effects resemble causes.   To make something fly, put  feathers
         on it and make chirping noises.  Wave it in the air.  The example is not
         entirely absurd and serves to illustrate the principle.  Much of the magick
         of "primitive" people  is of this  nature.   For example, rain  is made  by
         (among other  actions) sprinkling water on  the ground (or by  washing your
         car -- a modern example of the same principle!).

                                       LAW OF CONTAGION
         This  is the principle behind doll-sticking and such in "primitive" magick.
         This directly  relates to  Bell's theorem  and states  that things once  in
         physical contact continue  to influence  one another after  they have  been
         separated.  This relates more to our consciousness than to things as
         they are in the physical world, but defining the two is more difficult than
         they   appear  on  the  surface.     Thinking,  feeling,   and  memory  are
         associational  functions of  the human  brain.   New  data  are related  to
         existing knowledge and patterns  are established which correlate particular
         elements  of   knowledge.    The   overall  pattern,  which   includes  the
         "personality" and  the "world view" is  the METAPATTERN of all  this.  This
         metapattern we may consider to be made up of the  memories, fantasy images,
         beliefs, values, techniques, rules of  behavior, attitudes, etc. which make
         up the individuality of the person.
                              
                                    LAW OF IDENTIFICATION
         This law  relates to those  of Knowledge, Association  and Personification.
         It states that by complete association between your metapattern and that of
         another entity, you can BECOME that entity.  You can then examine your own
         metapattern from the point of view of that entity.  At full identification,
         one "becomes" the entity.  All idea of distinctness vanishes and you are
         empowered  with all  the  attributes of  that entity  because you  ARE that
         entity.    The danger  here  is that  many people  become  lost in  the new
         identity  as  the  stronger  metapattern  submerges  the  weaker.    Proper
         training, practice and guidance will lessen the danger.


                                                                                 834

                                       LAW OF SYNTHESIS
         Two opposing ideas or items of data will be resolved into a third idea that
         is more valid than the first two.  This principle allows you to hold two
         seemingly contradictory ideas (such as, "Electrons are particles," and
         "Electrons are waves.") at the same time.  Reality is as it is, not as we
         conceive  it  (or  even  as  we  perceive  it,  for  that   matter).    The
         wave-particle duality in physics is an example.  Physicists were nonplussed
         to  observe in  their  experiments that  light  behaved (depending  on  the
         experiment) sometimes  like a wave  and sometimes like  a particle.   Light
         striking a surface  of copper,  say, releases electrons  from the  surface.
         This  phenomenon, when examined closely, demonstrates that light is made up
         of particles (now called photons) which impart energy to the electrons,
         allowing them to escape.  However, another experiment, in which we direct
         a beam of light at some pinholes, "proves" that light is of the nature of
         waves.  If we direct a beam of light at an arrangement of pinholes:

         ---------------------------------------
         I          I                          I
         I          I                          I
         I          I               screen-->  I
         I          I                          I
         I                <--pinhole           I
         I          I                          I
         I          I                          I
                    I                          I
         LIGHT      I                          I
                    I                          I
         I          I                          I
         I          I                          I
         I                <--pinhole           I
         I          I                          I
         I          I                          I
         I          I                          I
         I          I                          I
         ---------------------------------------

         assuming that we have a beam  of "parallel" light (a plane wavefront),
         we see the light projected onto the screen.  If we cover one of the
         pinholes, we see a single  illuminated spot on the screen.  If  wwe uncover
         the  first  and cover  the  second  pinhole, we  again  see  a single  spot
         projected onto the  screen.  Now, if we  uncover both pinholes, what  do we
         see?  Two spots  of light?  No!  We see a  pattern of alternating light and
         dark bands on  the screen.  This phenomenon is  due to INTERFERENCE between
         the crests and  troughs of the  WAVES of light  as they strike  the screen.
         When two crests occur  together, or two troughs, the amplitude  is doubled,
         and we get a bright area. But when a crest and trough coincide, they cancel
         each  other,  and  the  result  is  a  dark  spot  of  zero  amplitude  (no
         brightness).   The point of all this  is that interference is necessarily a
         WAVE phenomenon.   The experiment  demonstrates the wave  nature of  light.
         How do  we resolve  the dilemma?   By  realizing that  we are dealing  with
         something that is neither a wave nor a particle, but SOMETHING ELSE.


                                                                                 835
