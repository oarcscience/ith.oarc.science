# BYLAWS Denver Area Wiccan Network

#### Last amended June 11, 1989

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

1.  The Board of Directors (hereinafter referred to as the Board) shall
    be selected by the Steering Committee from among the active members
    of DAWN such that:
    1.  Each coven shall have no more than one member on the Board; if
        there are fewer than 5 member covens, then there may be a second
        Director from any coven;
    2.  There shall be at least one member of the Board who is a member
        of a coven; and
    3.  There shall be at least one member on the Board from among the
        DAWN members who are not members of any coven.
2.  The Board shall have no fewer than 4 members and no more than 13
    members. It shall determine its own size within those limits.
3.  The Board may appoint members of DAWN to fill vacancies on the
    Board. Persons so appointed shall serve only until the next regular
    election.
4.  Each elected Director (member of the Board) holds a two-year term,
    except that, when the size of the board is increased, half of the
    new positions shall initially be for one year only. Any person
    serving one elected term may not be reelected as a Director until
    they have been retired from the Board for one year.
5.  Each seated Director may designate an Alternate to speak and vote in
    their stead when they are absent from Board meetings. The identity
    of this Alternate shall be recorded in the Minutes of the Board, and
    no other person may serve this function until the Director changes
    the designation and the change is on record. Being named Alternate
    to a Director does not automatically name them Alternate to any
    offices that director may hold; however, they may so serve at the
    discretion of the Chair.
6.  The Board shall elect Officers from among the Directors for the
    positions of Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer. This shall
    be done after each new election, and no later than the next regular
    meeting of the Board.
7.  A quorum of the Board shall consist of 70 percent of the Directors,
    either present or represented by their Alternate.
8.  The Board shall elect a Newsletter Editor from the general
    membership of DAWN. This officer shall serve at the will of the
    Board and report directly to the Board.
9.  The Board shall meet regularly, at least four times per year, at a
    time and place to be fixed by the Board. Additionally, The Chair or
    any two Directors may call a Board meeting upon giving at least 7
    days notice to all Directors by U.S. Mail, or upon at least 2 days
    notice given by telegram. Said notice will be deemed delivered when
    deposited in the U.S. Mail with the last known address of the
    Director and proper postage thereon prepaid, or when the given to
    the telegram company. Any Director may waive notice of any meeting.
    The attendance of a Director at any meeting shall constitute a
    waiver of notice, except when the Director attends the meeting for
    the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of business
    because the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. The
    notice of meeting need only contain the date, time, and place of the
    meeting.
10. The Board may make rules to govern the conduct of its own meetings.
11. All Board Meetings are open to the membership of DAWN. Accordingly,
    any Director is required to furnish information regarding dates,
    times and places of upcoming Board meetings to any DAWN member upon
    request.

STEERING COMMITTEE

1.  The Steering Committee shall be composed of the Directors, one
    representative from each member coven and proportional
    representation for such DAWN members as do not belong to any member
    coven (hereinafter referred to as Solitaries). The method of
    choosing a coven representative is left to the discretion of the
    individual coven. A method for choosing representation for
    Solitaries will be determined by said Solitaries, subject to
    approval by the Board. There shall be at least one (1)
    representative of the Solitaries, who is not a Director, on the
    Steering Committee.

6.  The Steering Committee may make rules to govern the conduct of its
    own meetings.
7.  Decisions made by the Steering Committee shall be referred to the
    Board for action, except as otherwise provided for in these Bylaws.

9.  AMENDMENTS  
    In order to amend this document, the proposed change must receive
    the votes of at least two-thirds of the Directors and must receive
    at least two-thirds of the votes cast at a proper meeting of the
    Steering Committee, both bodies having received at least 20 days

10. ELECTIONS  
    On the second Sunday in October, The Steering Committee shall meet

    replacements for Directors whose term is expiring. Names will be
    taken in nomination, consent obtained from those nominated, and one
    ballot cast. Each Committee member, including retiring and interim
    Directors, shall have as many votes as there are vacancies. The
    qualified candidate with the most votes will fill the first
    vacancy - two year terms being filled first. As each vacancy is
    filled, members of the successful candidate's coven are stricken
    from the list. If only one vacancy remains and either part I.A.2 or
    part I.A.3 of the Bylaws has not been fulfilled, then only those
    candidates who meet the criterion can be selected; otherwise, the
    position will remain vacant to be filled by the Board, as soon as
    possible, by appointment. If a tie exists between equally qualified
    candidates, where all may not serve, a runoff election shall be held
    between those candidates. Misspellings shall not invalidate ballots
    where the appropriate person can be discerned; nor shall voting for
    fewer than the number of vacancies. Voting for too many candidates
    shall invalidate that ballot. No individual shall vote more than one
    time for the same person; therefore duplicate names on a single
    ballot shall count as only one vote. All elected persons take office
    at the first meeting in November.
11. Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised (copyright 1970) will govern in
    any circumstances not covered by the Rules, Bylaws or Constitution
    of DAWN.
12. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS ON DISSOLUTION  
    In the event of dissolution of the organization, all remaining
    assets will be delivered to a tax-exempt organization to be chosen
    at the time of dissolution by the Board of Directors.
