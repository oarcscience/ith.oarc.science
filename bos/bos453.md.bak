                   Take a moment to relax, using regular, patterned breaths...
                   Feel all parts of your body, from toes to head, gradually
                   relax...
                   a blue glowing field surrounds you...
                   the blue glowing field slowly grows to surround your     
                   room...
                   the blue glowing field slowly grows to encompass the     
                   town/city you live in...
                   the blue glowing field slowly grows to encompase the     
                   landscape...
                   the blue glowing field slowly grows to encompass North   
                   America...
                   and each of you connect in with the fields of all the    
                   others...
                   the blue glowing fields of all the others here within    
                   Circle...
                   Feel its energies spinning from East...
                   to South...
                   to West...

                   Descend to this our Circle on your Night of Power.

              (1-5,Jehana) I am the Lady of the starry heavens
                   I am she who is the Mother of all living things
                   I have worked the landscape into mountains
                   lay the waters into their ocean beds,
                   and set the winds in their course.
                   Every snowflake, every speck of soil or sand
                   Bears my imprint.
                   My countenance appears in the faintest flicker,
                   and the largest star;
                   The Universe is My handiwork.
                   I am She who consoles the sorrowful,
                   and I am She who tends to the sick.
                   I bring solace to those in life,
                   and peace and understanding in death.
                   I am the changing Goddess --
                   Maiden, Mother, and Crone --
                   The Hag hidden deep within...
                   I have been to the Underworld,
                   and I have Returned.
                   Let there be beauty and strength,
                   Power and compassion,
                   Honor and humility,
                   Mirth and reverence within you.
                   And you who seek to know Me,
                   To feel My spirit
                   Come before Me with a sincere heart,
                   burn incense upon my altar
                   Listen and be still:
                   Know that your seeking and your yearning 
                   will avail you not,
                   Unless you know the Mystery:
                   For if that which you seek, 



                                                                                2125

                   you find not within yourself,
                   You will never find it without.
                   For Behold:  
                   I have been with you from the beginning,
                   and I am that which is attained at the end of          
                   desire.

              (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be!

              (1-8,Shadow Hawk) By the Flame that burneth bright O' Horned One!
                   We call thy name into the night, O' Ancient One!
                   Thee we invoke, by the moon-lit sea, 
                   by the standing stone and the twisted tree.
                   Thee we invoke, where gather thine own, 
                   by the nameless shrine forgotten and alone.
                   Come where the round of the dance is Trod.
                   Horn and Hoof of the Goatfoot God!
                   By moon-lit meadows on dusky hill, 
                   when the haunted wood is hushed and still.
                   Come to the charm of the chanted prayer.
                   As the moon bewitches the midnight air, 
                   evoke thy powers, that potent bide.
                   In shining stream and the secret tide, 
                   in fiery flame by starlight pale, 
                   in Shadowy host that rides the gale, 
                   and by the fern-brakes fairy-haunted 
                   of forest wild and woods enchanted.
                   Come!  O' Come!
                   To the heart-beat's drum!
                   When the broad white moon is climbing slow.
                   Through the stars to the heaven's height.
                   We hear thy hoofs on the wind of night!
                   As black tree-branches shake and sigh,
                   By Joy and terror we know thee nigh,
                   We speak the spell thy power unlocks,
                   At Solstice, Sabbat, and Equinox.
                   Word of Virtue the veil to rend,
                   From Primal Dawn to the wide World's end,
                   Since time began, the blessings of Pan
                   Blessed be in strength and love,
                   Blessed be, wher'ere we rove,
                   Vision fade not from our eyes
                   Of the Pagan Paradise.
                   Past the gates of Death and Birth,
                   Our inheritance of Earth.
                   From our soul the song of Spring
                   Fade not in our wandering, Our life is one, 
                   By blackest night or the noonday Sun. 
                   Eldest of Gods on thee we call, 
                   Blessing be on thy Creatures all.
                   I call upon thee, O' Ancient Horned One Who art the
                   Comforter and the Consoler of Men I call upon thee, O' Great
                   God of the Witches.
                   Ruler of the Sabbat, Lord of the Wild Woods, I call upon
                   thee in the Name of your Lady, Come out of the North upon



                                                                                2126

                   the back of the Winds.
                   And join the Lady Cerridwin at this Holy Sabbat/Esbat.
                   I call thee by thy most ancient name Cernunnos.

              (1-5,Jehana) This is Fullmoon August...
                   This is the season of Abundance...
                   and out of Wisdom in accessing that Abundance...
                   Knowing the difference between what we Want...
                   And what we Need...
                   Bearing this in mind..
                   each of us will have a chance...
                   to mention something or several somethings we need...
                   Please feel free to speak...

              (1-6,Al) I ask that I learn patience, to accept others for what
                   they are and to hear their thoughts and learn their wisdom.

              (1-5,Jehana) I ask for continued self-growth and self-acceptance

              (1-1,Helen) I ask for freedom from fear of abundance. 

              (1-5,Jehana) I ask for a cure for AIDS, and for ongoing
                   treatments for those who are in need.
                   I ask for an understanding of environmental issues which
                   face this planet.

                   feel yourselvs enveloped by a tree...
                   by a hazel tree...
                   Turn towards the Lord and Lady...
                   and ask...
                   in Perfect Love and in Perfect trust we stand before
                   Thee...
                   Feel the energy and Power grow...
                   each root and trunk and limb...
                   of that hazel tree...
                   Raise your hands, gradually...
                   with the energy...
                   Prepare to send...
                   One...
                   Two...
                   THREE!!!!
                   And, note, what you send out returns to you.

              (1-5,Jehana) Now...
                   Visualize before you an onion fresh from the harvest...

                   Sense your bodies re-absorbing the Energies of the Circle...
                   spiralling in...
                   into your room...
                   The blue glowing field...
                   a part of your body...
                   Take it in...
                   Let all return to as it has been.

              (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Fire Seal the Circle Round, Let it fade beneath
                   the ground...
                   let all things be as they were since the Beginning of Time.

              (1-5,Jehana) Merry meet...
                   and merry part...
                   and merry  meet again!

              (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Merry meet!
                   Blessed Be, Jehana.
