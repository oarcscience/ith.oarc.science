              GLENN INNES STANDING STONES: THE FIRST STANDING STONES OF MODERN TIMES

              Glenn Innes in northern NSW is home to many people descended from
              Scottish, Welsh, Cornish, Manx and Irish immigrants. The streets have
              Gaelic street signs, and in a marvellous initiative, the local Council
              have erected a stone circle "similar to those erected by Celtic People
              throughout Europe centuries ago". Three stones - named Gaelic, Bry-
              thonic and Australis - are the focal point of the circle; on the op-
              posite side of the circle four stones form the Southern Cross, with a
              Celtic stone acting as a pointer. Outside of the circle, stones at
              each of the cardinal points form an Ionic Cross.

              There are a total of 38 stones, with 24 being in the circle. Each one
              stands approximately 12 feet above the ground, and weighs several ton.
              Parts of the array of stones are intended to act as a calender, whilst
              other parts have a religious significance. Calculations by the Royal
              Australian Hydrographic Office were used to determine the position of
              the Winter Solstice; the positions of the Summer Solstice sunrise and
              sunset were observed on December 22nd 1990.

              Also in NSW, another stone circle - with a difference! At Mt Annan
              Botanical Gardens, 15 basalt crystal columns have been erected in a
              circle to form a "sundial of human involvement". This analemmatic
              sundial uses a movable marker to cast a shadow. And the moveable
              marker? A human, with arms raised above their head! The circle is so
              situated that it is possible to look out across the Blue Mountains, to
              the Sydney skyline in the distance.


                                                                                2238
