                                         The Wiccan Faith 
                       
                              I cangive youa briefoverview ofWicca. (Idon't speakfor
              all Wiccans, only myself.  There are some differences in the different
              Traditions.)   
                       
                      We believe that the ultimate godhead is unknowable.  This 
              doesn't make for a good working relationship with the diety, however. 
              So, we break it down into a Goddess and a God.  Different Wiccans 
              worship different Gods/Goddesses.  We can utilize *any* pantheon.  
              Some worship Pan/Diana, some Cernnunos/Aradia, Isis/Osiris, and many 
              others. 
               
                     We see our Goddess as being Triple Aspected -- Maiden, Mother,
              and Crone, and she is reflected in the phases of the Moon -- Waxing, 
              Full and Waning.  We see the God as the Lord of Nature, and he is 
              reflected in the seasonal changes.  Like Jesus Christ, he dies for the
              land and the people, and is reborn. 
                       
                      In general, we believe in reincarnation and karma.  What you 
              call Heaven, we call the Summerlands.  We don't believe that Hell 
              exists (or Satan either.)  We  believe that there should be balance in
              all things - when the balance is disturbed, that's when 'evil' occurs.

              Fire, for example is not 'evil'.  It could be  considered such when it
              becomes out of balance, as in a forest fire, or house fire.  
              Controlled fire is a useful tool.  Anger is not 'evil', but when 
              unbridled can't help but lead to negative things.  When properly 
              expressed and balanced with constructive working to correct that 
              which invoked the anger - it, too, can be a useful tool. 
                       
                      We regard the Earth as our Mother, and try to have respect for
              Her by not polluting her and try to live in harmony with Her and Her 
              ways. 
                       
                      Women reflect the Goddess, Men reflect the God, so the Wicca 
              have a Priestess and Priest to  'run' the religious services.  We call
              our services circles. 
                       
              This was sort of an "Reader's Digest Condensed Version" of Wicca.  
                       
                      Blessed be  >>Phoenix<<
