                                Karma, The Three Fold Law, & Grace 

                   "As you sew, so shall ye reap". "What goes around, comes around".
              "Whatever you send out returns three times".  These are all sayings
              very familiar to all of us, all of them examples of a supposedly
              Universal Law  of cause and  effect, action  and reaction.   Of course
              many of  the religious  systems try  to furnish us  with some  sort of
              "escape clause" that will  allow man to either alleviate  suffering fo
              past misdeeds,  or to escape  responsibility totally.   Let us take  a
              little closer look at these three ideas and ther inter-reationship.

                        It seems that, on one level, we do live ina mechanistic uni-
              verse,  one pretty  much  ruled by  cause-and-efect.   This  Newtonian
              universe  seems  to react  in a  very  mechanical fashion,  i.e. every
              action "produces  an equal and opposite reaction".  A good analogy for
              this is the example of one billiard ball striking another.  The energy
              from the striking billiard ball is transfered to the one struck and is
              used  to push against  the first, imparting motion  in the same direc-
              tion.  This brings the second law  into play, i.e. an object in motion
              tends to stay in motion untill acted upon by an outside force.

                   The principle of Karma basically says the same thing; i.e. any
              negative or positive action or thought remains that way, until it
              expends its energy by acting upon the originator.  Of course this also
              makes implicit the idea that thoughts or mental energy have a reality
              of their own, one that interacts with the physical universe.  If this
              idea is accepted, it then implies the existence of at least one more
              "world" or order of the universe, one with a non physical "reality",
              and one where the basic fundamental rules of physics (as we know them)
              may not truly apply.

                        The magician can bedescribed as one who "walksbetween" these
              two worlds.  "Walking between two worlds" implies that an individal is
              connected with both and can move between them at will.  The purpose of
              magic is to manipulate one world for the benefit of the other, i.e. to
              manipulate the unseen world for the express purpose of influencing
              events in the physical.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be a
              "free ride" anywhere in the universe, and when an individual acquires
              the power to do this, they also aquire a great deal of responsibility!
                   By accepting the power  to exert "leverage" in the  unseen world,
              an individual seems to also accept a multiplied succeptibility to
              influences initiated in that world.  This is why negative workings are
              so dangerous!  This may also be the reasoning behind the "law of three
              fold return".

                        Now comesthe hard part!  Ifall of this causeand effect stuff
              is absolute, how can any  individual ever hope to "pay off"  the debts
              for all of the "stupid"  things they have done not only  in this life-
              time, but in  many others?  Must we "pay  off" all past transgressions
              on a  one for one basis?  Is there  no ecape clause in this "contract"
              we seem to have for living in the universe?

                   This "escape clause" is called Grace by the Christians and by
              other names  in other systems, but  it does exist in  all.  Basically,
              the idea is this:  "Once a lesson is completely learned and one grows
              beyond a need for this lesson, it need not be repeated, even if the
              'books' are not balanced".  This is the "Enlightenment" sought by the
              Buddhist that allows the "breaking" of the wheel.

                                                                                1209
