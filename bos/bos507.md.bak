                         BEDLAM BELLS                                  
                               -Joe Bethancourt  
             (c) copyright 1992 W.J. Bethancourt III
             (Tune: "Mad Maudlin" aka "Tom O'Bedlam")
                                            
     Written as a theme song for the Bedlam Bells Morris dance troupe, and
             originally improvised at WesterCon 45, Phoenix, AZ.
                                            
     Tune guitar: DADGBD                    
                                            
                 Out upon the Borderlands   
                 I've watched the stars a-falling 
                 I've drunk deep from Mad River and 
                 I've heard my soul a-calling 
                                            
    CHORUS:   Still I sing bonny bells, bonny mad bells,
              Bedlam Bells are bonny!       
              For we all go bare and we live by the air
              And we want your drink and money!
                                            
     I now repent that ever                 My staff hath murder'd giants 
     Myself was so disdain-ed               My bells can call the thunder!
     My wits are lost since me I cros't     I stamp my feet and tread the dance
     Which makes me go thus chain-ed        And split the sky in sunder!
                                            
     To find our wits in Bordertown,      My horn is made of Elven-blades, 
     Ten thousand years we'll travel      I stole it cross the Border!
     And maudlin go on dancing toes,      The rainbow there is this I wear 
     To save our shoes from gravel        For my wits are out of order!
                                            
     I crossed into fair Elfland            I went to Digger's Kitchen 
     To find the soul I'd squandered        To beg some food one morning
     To hunt my sighs in children's eyes    I got my dreams served piping hot
     But still my soul had wandered         And saw a city burning
                                            
     I had an Elfin lady,                     I'll wander thru the Borderlands
     And took her for to wife me              With feathers in my hair-o
     She sleeps the day, she sings the night  With my true love close to my side
     And hearkens to delight me!              And back and sides go bare-o!
                                            
     Both in and out of Bordertown      I'll dance the day, I'll dance the night
     I've drank Mad River's water       And spend my time a-singing
     And stood upon the Bridge O'Dread  Dance out the old, ring in the new
     And watched the sudden slaughter!  With Bedlam Bells a-ringing!
                                            
                 Take a drink for Tom of Bedlam
                 Take a drink from the river's water!
                 And speak in sighs from darkened eyes
                 And court the River's daughter!
                                            
                                *           
                                            



                                            
                            *               
                                                                                2292
