                                      Walking with my Friends 
                                        Masochistic Maiden
                       The beach glistened under the sun, still wet from the
                       ebbing tide. My friends and I walked along leaving
                       tracks in the sand. We stopped at a tide pool and
                       discovered a bunch of sand dollars. The mark of a star
                       etched in each of the skeletal remains made us think of
                       the star at the center of the pentagram necklace I wore.

                       One gently held the necklace in his hand as we talked
                       about the meaning of each of the points. Earth, Air,
                       Fire, and Water, and then spirit. We talked how each of
                       these is a gift from Mother then we walked on.

                       He ran ahead and found a broken sand dollar with a tiny
                       mollusk, barely bigger than the head of a pin, inside.
                       We were amazed that anything so tiny could be alive. It
                       made us more aware of all the living things we often
                       overlook. Beneath our feet the ghost shrimp rested in
                       their tunnels, ocassionally blowing water back from the
                       many holes that dotted the beach. The larval forms of
                       life that clung to shells, stones, and settled in the
                       masses of seaweed thrown up by the surf, each caught our
                       attention before it was stolen by the gulls and crows
                       begging for scraps of bread.

                       Soaring overhead, the wings of the gulls whipped tiny
                       eddies of air that stirred the whisps of hair that had
                       escaped my ponytail and lifted the front few strands of
                       his hair. His eyes reflected the shine of the ocean on
                       the sand, and his quick voice and ready laughter made me
                       feel fleet of foot and full or the joy of youth.

                       After walking the beach we climbed a nature trail
                       through the woods. We stopped to look at the flowers,
                       delicate white stars with pink stripes. Again we thought
                       of the pentagram. We also imagined the Goddess of Spring
                       with feathers and flowers braided into her hair. A
                       little further we found a deep puddle with a surface as
                       smooth as glass. The sky and the trees were reflected
                       back at us in such precision and perfection that we
                       talked for a while of what that perfect world beyond the
                       puddle might be like. We wondered how we could make our
                       side of the mirror so peaceful and clean looking.

                       We walked further and came to a tall ancient tree and
                       wondered what stories it could have told, if we could
                       but understand. For a moment we could almost see the
                       native americans stalking deer and gathering herbs. The
                       tree, covered with a mass of moss as thick as carpeting
                       neither denied or confirmed our thoughts. Suddenly, with
                       a smile I thought of the ledgends of Gnomes that live
                       beneath the trees. This old trees roots held deep dark
                       holes and the forest litter was not creeping in to cover
                       them. The arching root looked so much like a roof over
                       an entry way and the size of the root system above the
                       ground indicated that a large family of Gnomes could
                       easily escape human eyes. Just a wink of time and they
                       could scamper out of sight beneath the undergrowth. We
                       could hear, if we stopped to listen, the soft sounds of



                       the wet undergrowth being disturbed. Was it the hurried
                       movement of little men in peaked caps?  Gnomes, weren't
                       they the creatures of the Elemental Earth? We could
                       smell the damp earth all about us. This was certainly a
                       good place for them.

                       After forest's close embrace, the clearing was sunshine
                       and sparkles. We saw dandilions growing on the green
                       hillside. We recognized them as one of springs first
                       splashes of color and representations of the sun shining
                       down on us. Carefully gathering several of the golden
                       heads we carried them to the mouth of the nearby stream
                       as it lead to the ocean. We threw them into the water,
                       watching them float down to the sea. With each flower we
                       sent a wish....no more oil slicks....less
                       polution...save some of the natural rain forests...each
                       of us remember to carry away a bit of trash every time
                       we go for a walk...no more whales beaching...no more
                       drift nets dragging sea mammals to their deaths...a bit
                       of nature for every child...and healing for Earth mother
                       where she has been strip mined. Then we turn to leave,
                       neither of us really wanting to go.

                       James isn't three yet, and Scott is only five, but they
                       were my friends as we walked and they gave me a chance
                       to share the wonder and beauty of the beach and the
                       woods.  Take time with the young. There is much they can
                       teach us and give us when we take the time to share
                       their world.
               
                                                                                2358
