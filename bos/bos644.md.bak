    Initiation.

      To become a witch you must have a natural inclination to worship the
    Old Gods. It must be a feeling which springs from the heart and carries
    you on towards your goal, in exactly the same way it happened to the
    first witches thousands of years ago.
      The approach must be in this manner. Any other attitude, such as
    vulgar curiosity, a desire for power over others, or the selfish
    intention of using magic to gain material ends, will only end in failure
    and disillusion.
      The Old Gods are ancient archetypal images of the divine powers behind
    all Nature. They are the oldest gods known to man. Pictures of them are
    painted all over Europe and show the great influence they had, even at
    the Dawn of Time.
      Just because they are so old, is no reason to believe they are in any
    way 'out of date'. Our ancesstors were no fools: their way of life and
    their culture is gaining more and more respect as the years go by.
    Continuous discoveries about their skills and beliefs growing admiration
    and amazement.
      Their deities were a Mother Goddess and a Horned God, representing the
    twin forces of life: male and female, light and dark, positive and
    negative, Sun and Moon, etc. These complimentary aspects in nature are
    'fact' and cannot be disputed. And, because the Gods are true
    representations of the divine powers behind all manifestation, they have
    endured through millennia, and will always endure.
      Unlike many other religions, where contact with divinity is sought
    through prayer and meditation, witchcraft teaches development of the
    soul through the Eight Paths of the Witches' Wheel. These ways are part
    of the Western Mystery Tradition. The West and the East are two very
    different places. Eastern religions teach their followers to look
    'within' for enlightenment, and although the West uses this method in
    meditation, it is only 'one' of the Eight Paths. The Western mind looks
    'outward' and seeks spiritual grace by helping others. Thus, the witches
    use their powers to help those in sickness or trouble.
      The Awakening can begin as an urge which rises from the depths of the
    soul. A state of boredom or despiration, which every human being comes
    to at some point of incarnation, can become as a beacon to the spirit.
      It is born to the struggling soul and to the complacent alike. Many
    lives may be endured before it is realized that the true self must
    take the initiative and begin to fight its own way out of the Cycles of
    Incarnation, which, without the control of the Higher Self, may continue
    indefinitely. Once the realization is born, and the quest begun, the
    soul is on its way from manhood to godhood.
      Regarding the Craft, it is wise to seek initiation from a 'genuine'
    coven. This is not as easy as it sounds, as genuine adherents do not
    seek converts, and therefore do not advertise for members. they believe
    that if a person is sincere and determined enough in their desire to
    belong to the Craft, they will, sooner or later, make contact.
      There are, however, various ways of speeding things up a little, such
    as contributing to one of the privately printed occult magazines, which
    are usually run by people 'in the know'. Or even placing a small advert
    in one of these papers. You can also write to the author of a book on
    the subject, and send the letter via the publishers. It might then be
    forwarded to a coven in your area, although I must add here that even if
    3108

    this happens, and you are invited to meet someone from a coven, it would
    not be indicative of entry.
      There are certain conditions which have to be fulfilled, such as
    blending in with the personalities of the members, having read widely on
    the subject, a willingness to submit to a waiting period, usually a year
    and a day, among others. Yet these conditions are valid ones; you cannot
    expect to be accepted quickly, but you will know that the witches you
    meet have undergone similar obstacles themselves.
      The ways of the witches are those of caution, especially where
    strangers are concerned. After all, who would admit a stranger to their
    home without an introduction, let alone to a temple of the Mysteries.
      Care must be taken, too, in finding a coven which is in close
    'rapport' with your own life-style, culture and character. But, once
    contact is made, there is hope in finding a group where conditions, on
    both sides, can be fulfilled.
      Although some covens wear robes, the traditional way of working in the
    Circle, is to be sky-clad, or naked. When you are brought into the
    Craft, yoou enter as you were born, without clothes or ties of any kind.
    The first initiation is virtually an introduction to a new way of life.
    You are made a 'Child of the Goddess'; you are shown the tools of the
    Craft; told the ways of working magic, and made to swear an oath to keep
    the secrets of the Art. This is called the First Degree.
      The Second Degree is the initiation proper. Thsis involves the concept
    of symbolic death and symbolic resurrection, when you are re-born with
    the new magical personality. A new name (of your own choice) is given to
    you which represents the transformation, and by which, henceforth, you
    will be known when in the Circle.
      The drama of this mystery play implants its ideas firmly in the
    subconscious mind of the adherent, and the mystery, which is enacted
    on the material plane, sets the seal on the future.
      It is not to be supposed that by initiation and teaching you will
    automatically be 're-born'. A way will be shown, and knowledge
    imparted, yet the journey is always 'alone' and the true 'will' tested
    to the very brink of breaking point.
      In a sense, when initiation takes place it is very much like daring
    Fate to do its worst. One has taken a stand: "I announce to all creation
    that I will endure to progress."
      In witchcraft the soul develops a deeper understanding of 'being'.
    This entails practice, which is why the Craft has grades of advancement.
    The highest grade is the consummation of the mysteries, where ritual
    yields to what is termed, 'The Secret of the Silver Wheel'.
      There is also the imparting of certain 'secret' words, which, in
    themselves, convey very little, but their secret intention 'is'
    important and gently 'nudges' the aspirant onward.
