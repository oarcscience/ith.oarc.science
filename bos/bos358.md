              By: Dan Holdgreiwe 
                To: Adrienne 
                Re: Dangers of Deity? 
                ----------------------- 

                 
                In the presence of the Goddess, Adrienne said to Dan Holdgreiwe: 
                 
                PH> ...to suggest that the human psyche, confronted with the Divine PH> presence
                without being built up to sustain that impact, can frag       ment. 
                 
                DH> I don't buy it, at least not in those terms. This sort of thing     makes for
                impressive sermons, but it does not correspond to the     Divine reality that I have
                experienced. 
                 
                  Ae> Then you're lucky.  I'm with Paul Hume on this one. 
                 
                Well, I've been rethinking this myself, mostly because I realized that in other
                contexts I make a big deal about the "dangers" of confronting the Divine.  So why
                was I so critical of the dangers espoused by Paul and others? 
                 
                A major reason, I beleive is that I was taking their statements too literally. I
                can't take the image of God as a high voltage line seriously.  For that matter, I
                find myself more and more disatisfied the the electrical metaphor that so permiates
                modern discussions of magic.  Words such as "charging," "grounding," and "energy"
                capture only one side -- and not the most important side -- of ritual work.  My over
                literal reading of their posts conjured up a ridiculous image in my mind, which I
                emphatically rejected. 
                 
                Let me say instead that the dangers of encounter with the Divine are not electrical,
                but rather are moral and intellectual.  If one demands a relationship with Deity
                which exceeds one's moral maturity, one does indeed face serious risks.  I suspect
                that most of these risks are related to self-deception and self-indulgence, but I
                suppose that in extreme cases the damage to the personality could be more rapid. 
                All this, of course, presumes a basically healthy psyche. 
                 
                On the other hand, approaching Deity often feels much more dangerous than it is.  We
                are likely to feel a great deal of fear as our pretensions and denials are stripped
                away by the appraoch of the Divine presence.  This feeling of fear is necessary and
                good, but it is fear of change as much as fear of real danger. 
                 
                  Ae> Traumatic not just for the unwilling.  I recently had a pries          tess of
                mine who did the Drawing Down for the first time and she        was profoundly
                disturbed by it.  Not in an unpleasant way, but         she's well trained and she
                still found the whole experience hard        to deal with on an emotional level.
                Some people can shrug it           off, others find it hard to incorporate into
                themselves.  Kinda        like losing one's virginity... 
                 
                I wasn't thinking that "emotionally hard to deal with" was what Paul et al. meant by
                "zapped" or "crispy."  Certainly such experiences can be emotionally hard to deal
                with (although I have never found them so myself). 
                 
                  Ae> To be blunt, bullsh*t.  Sure it can.  The Gods sometimes force         us to
                prove our mettle, *especially* if we ask them to.  If we         are strong
                enough,fine.  If not... 
                 
                Prove our mettle at what exactly?  Lightning bolts at fifty paces?  I probably agree
                with you, but I reject the idea that we are tested like transistors -- turn on the
                juice and throw away the ones that burn out. 


                                                                                               1822
              

               
                Ae> Besides, the biggest danger isn't in the presence of the Divine.        It's
                when the mage/priest *thinks* the Divine is there and is          deluded.  The
                unconscious mind will happily produce all sorts of        fantasies if you ask. 
                 
                This I agree with 100% 
                 
                  Ae> It isn't a case of how effective the participants are, rather,         how
                ineffective.  Delusion is a stock in trade for the occult          arts. 
                 
                Here you seem to have come around to my side.  Most dangers come not from the
                presence of the Gods, but rather from their absence.  An imaginary power line isn't
                dangerous, but an imaginary like with God/dess is.

                By: Paul Hume 
                To: Dan Holdgreiwe 
                Re: Re: Dangers of Deity? 
                ---------------------------- 
                 
                Dan - 
                 
                The zapped or crispy metaphor (hmmm, more Divine Electricity imagery) could include
                "emotional discomfort," though I find that to be so basic an element in dealing with
                Divine encounters (in my *vast* experience (g)), as the ego tries to relate to what
                has just happened, that I don't really consider it at issue. 
                 
                Someone who shrugs and mutters "No big deal," whether they've Drawn Down a God for
                the first or five hundredth time has more of a problem, in my arrogant opinion, than
                someone who throws shrieking fits in the wake of the experience (assuming they get
                to stop screaming, eventually). 
                 
                Yes, the crispness of the unprepared is, in fact, a metaphor for psychological
                disintegration, an explosion of "mundane consciousness" in the wake of an experience
                which blows the underpinnings out from under it. In a not uncommon example,
                priesthood who begin to expect, to demand, the reverence shown them when they are
                vessels of the Divine be shown them when they are not exercising their theurgic
                office. Whether it is a Wiccan HPS or a Catholic monsignor (or 
                what you will), this is a typical poison that can breed in the wake of the Divine
                invocation. 
                 


                                                                                               1823
              


              Psychically, the Gods ARE high-voltage lines, whether you accept them as "real" or
                "mere archetypes," or whatever. They, by definition, function on a level of
                consciousness that is tremendously potent in the context of day-to-day awareness.
                And they may be as solicitous of humans as a human is when caring for a small and
                fragile animal, but They also do not exercise the same controls on humans that
                humans do on animals, and rarely force us to turn away from danger, though They try
                and protect us when we think to ask for it. 
                 
                The fact that humanity contains (in my view) Divine potential in its own right
                allows for humans to confront Deity on its own plane, even at the cost of the
                present incarnation. 
                 
                Paul 
                 
                By: Dan Holdgreiwe 
                To: Paul Hume 
                Re: Re: Dangers of Deity? 
                -------------------------- 

                In the presence of the Goddess, Paul Hume said to Dan Holdgreiwe: 
                 
                  PH> The zapped or crispy metaphor (hmmm, more Divine Electricity          
                imagery) could include "emotional discomfort," though I find           that to be so
                basic an element in dealing with Divine encounters        (in my *vast* experience
                (g)), as the ego tries to relate to           what has just happened, that I don't
                really consider it at             issue. 
                 
                Really?  My own experience has included more than a little emotional 
                discomfort, but almost all of it was in those periods when I wasn't receiving
                palpable confirmation that the work was acomplishing anything.  Breaking through to
                the Divine, on the other hand, is usually a joyful, ecstatic experience for me. 
                 
                Part of this may be training (I spent about 10 unpleasant but productive years under
                the disipline of a very demanding spiritual group) and part of it may be a matter of
                pre-stripping the ego in anticipation of contact with the Divine (a less than common
                practice among Pagans, who tend tobe suspicious of anything that smacks of humility-
                ). 
                 
                  PH> Someone who shrugs and mutters "No big deal," whether they've          Drawn
                Down a God for the first or five hundredth time has more         of a problem, in my
                arrogant opinion, than someone who throws         shrieking fits in the wake of the
                experience (assuming they get        to stop screaming, eventually). 
                 
                I would agree, but I find the more common reaction to be along the lines of "Oh,
                wow!" or even "Mmmmmmmmmmm, yes!"  Perhaps this means I'm not "plugged in" to the
                high-amp Deities (like maybe Cthulu). <g> 
                 
                On a more serious note, I probably use an egregore that mediates the 
                relationship with God/dess in ways that make screaming fits less likely -- thought I
                suppose it could be disputed whether this was good or bad. 
                 


                                                                                               1824
              


                PH> Yes, the crispness of the unprepared is, in fact, a metaphor for      
                psychological disintegration, an explosion of "mundane con            sciousness" in
                the wake of an experience which blows the under         pinnings out from under it.
                In a not uncommon example, pries           thood who begin to expect, to demand, the

                  or a Catholic monsignor (or what you will), this is a typical          poison that
                can breed in the wake of the Divine invocation. 
                 
                Ah, this is where your metaphor confuses me. You speak of an "explosion" but your
                example is more akin to a cancer -- not a dramatic shattering of the personality,
                but a gradual corruption.  The latter is a danger that I readily acknowledge. 
                 
                  PH> Psychically, the Gods ARE high-voltage lines, whether you accept       them as
                "real" or "mere archetypes," or whatever. They, by       definition, function on a
                level of consciousness that is treme      ndously potent in the context of
                day-to-day awareness. 
                 
                  PH> The fact that humanity contains (in my view) Divine potential in       its own
                right allows for humans to confront Deity on its own       plane, even at the cost
                of the present incarnation. 
                 
                The Lord and Lady are indeed potent, but their energy is wisely controlled.  Each of
                us, hoever, is a high-voltage line in much less capable hands.  I believe it is not
                God/dess, but our own Divine potential which will "zap" us if we are careless in its
                use.
