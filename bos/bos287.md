                              Drugs and Religion -- Snakebite Trips? 

                                          Loren Petrich  

                      In Merlin Stone's book "When God Was a Woman", about early 

              goddesses, there is a strange hypothesis about the importance of 

              snakes in the early Middle East. MS notes that snakes are associated 

              with prophecy and wisdom -- and goddesses -- in several places, such 

              as Egypt, Sumer, Crete, and Greece. In Egypt, the female deity of 

              predynastic northern (Lower) Egypt was the cobra goddess Ua Zit. 

              Egyptian deities  and royalty has a _uraeus_ emblem -- a head and hood

              of a cobra. Some Sumerian goddesses, such as Inanna, were associated 

              with snakes. In Minoan-era Crete, we find some statuettes of goddesses

              or priestesses with snakes. In one case, the snakes are cobras. In 

              Greece, in what is most likely a Minoan legacy, Hera and Athena were 

              associated with snakes, and the shrines of Delphi, Olympia, and Dodona

              were originally associated with goddesses. However, they were taken 

              over by the followers of the male gods Zeus and Apollo, who were 

              depicted as snake-killers. Even then, the greatest wisdom was 

              associated with priestesses. Serpenticidal male gods also include 

              Marduk, who killed Tiamat, and Yahweh himself, who killed Leviathan. 



                      MS suggests a connection to the Adam and Eve legend. The 

              Philistines had "snake tubes" nearly identical to some found on Crete,

              which is consistent with them being Cretan refugees. So some "snake 

              priestesses" may have set up shop in Palestine when the Israelites 

              showed up. The Adam and Eve legend may have been an effort to 

              discredit these women, for it suggests that snakes are wicked, and 

              women who listen to snakes are wicked. This is all in keeping with the

              Yahvist effort to discredit religions other than the worship of 

              Yahweh, which is a sordid story of religious persecution. This 

              persecution involved going so far as destroying a bronze snake kept in


                                                                                1420

              the Temple, the Nehushtan, which could supposedly cure snakebite. This

              snake was probably associated with an earlier acceptance of this snake

              cult. 



                              Buthow didthissnake cultactuallywork? Itisdifficult to

              say, but MS offers a strange hypothesis. She notes that we are told 

              that Cassandra  and Melampus had acquired prophetic powers from having

              their  ears licked with snakes. So is there some snakebite connection?

              MS suggests that there was, and tells of someone who had been 

              immunized against krait venom, but who had been bitten by a krait 

              [_Cobras in the Garden_, H. Kursh] 



                      He had developed a sense of enhanced awareness and he had 

              visions. He reported himself making up verses, and said "My mind had 

              extraordinary powers." 



                      This is evidently much like mescaline [from peyote] or 

              psilocybin [in certain mushrooms], used by some Native Americans for 

              similar purposes; those who take these two or LSD often feel as if 

              they are in touch with the basic forces of existence and a sensation 

              of perceiving the events and meaning of the past, present,  and future

              with great clarity and comprehension. It could well be that some snake

              venoms have components similar effects. 



                      So could it be that early snake prophetesses (and male 

              prophets) were going on snakebite trips? 



                      Oracles connected with snakes were consulted in Greece and 

              elsewhere for important decisions, which seems very trustworthy of 

              people with "highs". 


                                                                                1421

                      One does have to ask the question on how this type of 

              prophesying got associated with women instead of men or both sexes 

              equally in the ancient Middle East. 



                      This only adds to the riddle of Minoan Crete. Since the 

              priestesses there were important citizens, and since they are 

              associated with snakes, then could some of the leaders of Crete back 

              then have been snakebite-tripping priestesses? The possibility of a 

              "feminist theocracy", rule by a largely female priesthood, seems 

              awesome enough (no prominent "kings"), but this is truly wild. 



                      I confess I don't have much taste for theocracy, but I would 

              certainly prefer a Minoan-type theocracy (if that was what it was)  to

              the more familiar kinds -- Jewish, Christian, and Muslim -- which I 

              find absolutely disgusting. 


                                                                                1422
