                                          The Heirophant 

                        "An official expounder ofsacred mysteries or religious cere-
              monies,esp.  in ancient Greece;  an initiating or  presiding priest" -
              OED.  I generally  use it in  the "initiating priest/ess" context  (CM
              heritage,that).   Those who hold the power *and authority* to initiate
              others into  our particular Trad,  are hierophants when  they actually
              exercise that power.

                        Most of usare explicitlyoathbound to ensurethat thecandidate
              is a worthy person, properly prepared to receive what we  are about to
              confer,and  that the  rite  of adoption/initiation  is correctly  done
              according  to Trad standards.  Those Trads who've dispensed with oaths
              still, implicitly,expect something rather similar.

                        When I consider acandidate for initiation,I first look tosee
              whether I have a 'proper person' according the expectations of my Art.
              Next I look to see whether the Lady's Initiation rests upon them. 

                   Lastly, I look to see that s/he understands what s/he is about to
              promise, and has the skills necessary to carry it out (the gumption to
              stand  by his/her oath  is part of  'proper person', IMO).   While the
              marks ARE plain to  see,speculation by the uninitiated notwithstanding
              <g>,  all three  ARE judgement  calls  on my  part.   Then again,  ANY
              situation touching upon my Oath requires a judgement call on my part.

                        At1st Degree,Alexandriantradition permitsme toextend benefit
              of the  doubt in cases  where the  marks are recent  enough that  they
              shine but dimly (or where the candidate's history leads one to suspect
              s/he may not feel bound to stand by what s/he swears to).   Gardnerian
              tradition does not. Then  again, H'Alexandrian tradition requires that
              no benefit  of the doubt be granted  at 2nd Degree, whereas Gardnerian
              tradition again contradicts.  In either case, a 2nd of either Trad has
              been put to  the test and found  fully appropriate to the  Trad in the
              judgement of his/her heirophant, we simply do it at different degrees.
              (That's the theory,anyway,  and why we come down so  hard on those who
              f*ck-initiate.)
