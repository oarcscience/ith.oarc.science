                                 BLOOD SACRIFICE 
                               by Althea Whitebirch

          We  have all moved through periods of crisis in our  lives;  things
     ranging  from the sublime to the ridiculous,  from the death of  someone
     close to us to final exams.  Events which are extremely stressful--which
     threaten  our lives,  home,  future or security--would seem t  call  for
     strong  measures of assistance.   There have been many times that I have
     felt that the course of events required swift and strong intervention of
     a deity. Blood sacrifice is, to my mind, one of the more powerful magics
     one could perform,  and so seemed particularly suitable for  this.   But
     it's rather ethically sticky.

          I  may feel that the kind of energy contained in the outpouring  of
     blood would be most efficacious in a serious situation, but I'm dead-set
     against the use of an unwilling victim for the purpose.  So, in the past
     I've spilled my own blood with an athame,  at the same time  offering up
     prayers;  it  just  didn't seem to work as well as I thought  it  would.
     Perhaps,  I thought, one needs lots of blood to generate any appreciable
     amount of energy.

          Then  a  friend suggested what seemed the  perfect  solution--blood
     donation!   I'd been giving blood for several years and the thought just
     never had occurred to me before.  So the next time I went in to donate, I
     approached it as ritual sacrifice for a particular purpose, and both the
     process and results seemed to be much improved.  Since then I've gone to
     donate  blood  many times,  each time with a prayer for healing for  the
     recipient of my blood,  and a request for aid from the deity that  seemed
     most appropriate.

          For those of you who've never donated blood before, I can provide a
     few details of the process.   It's not very frightening, and it can be a
     very spiritually moving experience,  I'll tell you!   As well,  remember
     that you don't sell blood (at least not in Puget Sound), you donates it.
     You  can sell plasma--the straw-colored fluid that makes up the bulk of
     your blood--but not blood itself.

         The  first  time you go in you'll fill out a medical  questionnaire:
     the  Puget Sound Blood Bank doesn't want your blood if you're ill  right
     then (or just getting over something),  taking certain medications, ever
     had hepatitis or malaria, or are in a high-risk category for contracting
     AIDS (Haitian,  homosexual,  needle-using drug user or prostitute).   If
     you have any questions, they'll be happy to answer them.

          After  you  fill out the questionnaire,  they'll  take  your  blood
     pressure  and  a blood sample (like sticking your finger with a pin)  to
     test  your hemocrit (% of hemoglobin) as well as determining  what  type
     your  blood is.   If your hemocrit count isn't high enough they'll  send
     you  home.     Nowadays,  all  blood is sent to a lab to be  tested  for
     presence  of  AIDS  anti-bodies as well;  if you test  positive  they'll
     notify  you by mail.   You'll be asked if you've eaten in the last  four
     hours, and if not, sent to the canteen for cookies and juice.

                                                                             547

          Then comes the fun part--you go lie down on a table where a phlebo-
     tomist  (who  draws the blood) asks you some  questions,  verifies  your
     name, and then sets you up to donate. They tie a rubber hose around your
     arm,  so  the vein will stand out and be easy to find.   They  use  cold
     liquid ethyl chloride on your arm,  to numb it where the needle goes in.
     I  won't  say that it doesn't hurt when the needle is inserted--it  does
     but it's tolerable--when it's in place though,  you'll hardly know  it's
     there.   (You  may get the idea from all this that I'm a  stoic--hardly!
     I'm a wimp when it comes to pain,  but this I can handle.)  At this time
     they'll  leave  you  there for up to five minutes while you  clench  and
     relax  your hand (to keep the blood from clotting) and the  blood  flows
     into  a little plastic bag.   It's warm and red,  and rather reassuring,
     really.   At this time you can get into some really serious  prayer,  or
     hum  a  little healing chant for the person your blood's going  to.   (I
     once  was  doing  this and got a flash image of a  little  boy,  a  burn
     victim.   I  always  wondered who got my blood that  day.)   I  wouldn't
     recommend getting too spaced-out though;  remember you've got to be able
     to  return  to yourself when you want to,  and the physical  effects  of
     giving blood can make some people light-headed or slightly woozie.  When
     they ask you how you're feeling,  be honest,  not macho.  You don't want
     to embarrass yourself by fainting.

          Afterwards they'll ask you to have some juice and cookies.   By all
     means,  do!   For one thing, you've earned them; for another it's impor-
     tant  to  replace the fluid and blood sugar you just gave  up.   Working
     magic really takes it out of you, too (at least it does me).

          In my experience, there are several good reasons to use this parti-
     cular method of blood sacrifice: a)  It doesn't require the death of one
     of  the Gods' children.   b)  It is giving of yourself--for the good  of
     others as well as your own.  c)  It is safe--the Blood Bank uses sterile
     instruments and never  re-uses needles, so you can't catch anything.  d)
     You have the added benefit of being able to see the blood as it's  being
     given  (somehow  that adds to my experience),  and a pint is a lot  more
     than I've ever been able to get with a knife!  Next time you want to get
     the Gods' attention, try it!

                              FOUR WEEK FAST 
     *
     FIRST WEEK
     *
     If you normally eat meat, begin to eliminate it from your diet
     during this first week. If you feel you must eat it, eat a small
     amount and no more than 3 times during the week.
     *
     Eliminate all alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages (except for
     bottled waters such as Artesia, etc.), and diet drinks. Substitute
     fruit juices or fruit drinks.
     *
     Refrain from smoking (anything), or using any other intoxicants.
     *
     Cut way back on any other stimulants, such as coffee or tea or
     cocoa. No more than three cups a day if you are a heavy coffee or
     tea drinker.
     *
     Use as little salt as possible and no other spices.
     *
     Refrain from sweets - cakes, pies, candy.
     *
     Drink large amounts of fluids, especially water.
     *
     *
     SECOND WEEK
     *
     Eliminate meat entirely. Substitute dairy products - IN MODERATION.
     *
     Continue to limit intake of stimulants (coffee, tea, cocoa),
     cutting back to no more than two cups a day.
     *
     Continue to avoid tobacco, alcohol, other intoxicants, spices,
     and soft drinks, and use as little salt as possible.
     *
     Continue to drink large amounts of water.
     *
     Your diet should consist largely of vegetables and grains, with
     large amounts of liquids.
     *
     *
     THIRD WEEK
     *
     Limit intake of stimulants (coffee, tea, cocoa) to one cup a day.
     *
     Continue to avoid tobacco, alcohol, other intoxicants, meat,
     spices, and soft drinks, and use as little salt as possible.
     *
     Do not use meat in seasoning vegetables.
     *
     Your diet should consist of vegetables and fruits only. Raw
     vegetables and fruits are best (nuts can be included). Drink large
     amounts of water and substitute fruit or vegetable juices for meals
     as often as possible.
     *

     FOURTH WEEK (first four days)
     *

                                                                             549

     Fluids only. Fruit and vegetable juices in desired quantity,
     cutting back each day. Drink large amounts of water. If you feel
     you must have coffee, limit it to a cup a day (a half cup if
     possible).
     *
     If you feel you must have something the first day or so of this
     week, a small handful of raisins or other dried fruit may be taken.
     Nibble slowly. As the week progresses, continue to cut back on
     nibbles and the amount of juice taken. A spoonful of honey added
     to hot water helps satisfy the craving for hot beverages and gives
     you an energy boost.
     *
     *
     THE FAST
     *
     The fast should last for three days. It is best to do this on a
     weekend and if possible, alone and in the woods. (Go camping!)
     *
     Drink lots of water and if you feel the need for an energy
     stimulant, a small amount of honey may be added to hot water.
     *
     Spend as much time as possible in meditation. This period should
     sooth your spirit as well as cleanse your body. RELAX!
     *
     You will probably want to sleep a lot. Do so. Allow yourself to
     drift with your thoughts. Do not attempt to solve your problems
     during this time. They will solve themselves later, for your mind
     will be clearer after the fast is over.
     *
     Most people feel great the first day, a little weakness the second
     day, and great again on the third day.
     *
     *
     AFTER THE FAST
     *
     Eat lightly for your first meal after the fast. It is best to begin
     by returning to fruit and vegetable juices and working your slowly
     into solid foods over a few days.
     *
     *
     THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS TO DRINK LARGE AMOUNTS OF
     WATER ALL THE WAY THROUGH! This flushes out toxins the body is
     releasing.
