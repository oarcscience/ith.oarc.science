                                      YULE RITUAL

             The celebrants gather in a room apart from the ritual area.
             It is best if the ritual can be held in a room without lights
             and with no heat.  Priest and Priestess may choose to cast
             the circle before hand and allow all to enter through a
             portal, or cast after the candle lighting. At the time for
             the ritual to begin, the warden and maiden lead all into the
             ritual area with only one dim candle to light the way which
             circles to the Southern tower and stays there.  As all shiver
             in the darkness, the priest and priestess, at the Southern
             tower begin, alternating:

             It is winter.
             It is night.

             We await the Sun.
             We await the light.

             In this darkness
             In this night,

             We await the warmth.
             We await the light.

             (Together:) And slowly it comes.

             (As they have moved around the cirle saying these things, the
             Priestess Widdershins and the Priest Deosil, they light
             candles which completely surround the circle. By the time
             they have finished, the room should be very bright.)

             Circle is cast if not already.  Salt and water. Fire and air.
             Quarters summoned in manner appropriate to the season.

             God Invocation
             Priestess:

             Horned God, Winter God, Father of the Sun, with frost upon
             your beard and the blazing of Yule fires in your eyes, you
             bless us with your presence. We greet you.

             Goddess Invocation
             The Winter God (lighting the appropriate candles, which are
             held by women appropriately dressed):

             White is for the Maiden, divine and joyous child.  Fresh as
             the snow is her taper.  I give greetings, Blessed One.

             Red is for the Mother, warm embracing creation queen.
             Scarlet as the winter sunset is her taper.  I give greetings,
             Regal One.

             Black is for the Crone, keeper of magical mysteries.  Ebon as
             the stormy night is her taper.  I give greetings, Wise One.

             Queens of winter, Sister, Mother, Grandmother, I greet you
             and ask your blessings upon your people gathered here.

             The three Goddesses, dividing the parts appropriately, invoke
             the Sun (the Maiden then crowns the God with a crown of
             candles or other appropriate crown, the Mother gives him a
             staff with a pine cone tip and the Crone gives him a kiss):
             Return, oh, return!  God of the sun, god of the light,
             return!  Darkness has fled -- Thou hast no enemies.  O lovely
             helper, return, return!
             Return to thy sister, thy spouse, thy mother who loveth thee!
             We shall not be put asunder.  O my brother, my consort, my
             son, return, return!  When I see thee not my heart grieveth
             for thee, mine eyes seek for thee, my feet roam the earth in
             search of thee!  Gods and men weep for thee together.  God of
             the sun, god of the light, return!  Return to thy sister, thy
             spouse, thy mother, who loveth thee!  Return!  Return!
             Return!

             The God raps three times on the altar with his wand

             Sun King:
             Newly born, am I.  What wisdom says the watcher of the east
             to aid me and those gathered here with me?

             East:
             This is a time for entering wilderness and seeking its
             magical strengths.  A time for standing alone and godlike,
             and seeing all things clearly.  It is a season of joy!

             Sun King:
             What wisdom says the watcher of the south?

             South:
             This is a time of active seeking, both without in nature and
             within oneself.  Eagerness and resolution shall concern
             mysteries and create results.  It is a season of courage!

             Sun King:
             What wisdom says the watcher of the west?

             West:
             This is a time for devotion to the way of the wild places and
             seeking the calmness of solitary locales.  A time for finding
             understanding, and confiding only in trusted friends.  It is
             a season of meditation!

             Sun King:
             What wisdom says the watcher of the north?

             North:
             This is a time to know the endurance of the hills, and to so
             grow in one's own inner firmness.  A time for scrupulousness
             and thoroughness and considering all things.  It is a season
             of confidence!

             The Winter God:

             Rich are these gifts of knowledge.  Soon I will give way to
             my Son, but until that time mine is the feast and the season
             of joy.  (The God blesses the feast as is customary for the
             group.)

             Each Deity and Watchers is thanked and bid farewell as they
             were invoked.

             The circle is released as is appropriate to the group.

             Notes:

             If anyone is crowned with a crown of candles, a veil helps
             with the dripping wax.  Holly can be pretty uncomfortable,
             too, so ditto.

             Portions of this are liberally stolen from the Magical Rites
             from the Crystal Well by Ed Fitch.  It's great stuff and you
             may want to use it outright, rather than my mutilated
             version.

             If you have enough people and candles, everybody may be naked
             by the end of this.

             It's great to use your oldest male as Winter and your
             youngest male for the Sun (kids are great suns).  Same for
             the Goddesses.

             Obviously, this is just an outline that can be spindled,
             folded and mutilated any way you like.  The opening part with
             the candles we have used for more than one Yule and it's
             really great.

             We have also done a guided meditation into Herne's Grove,
             rather than a Winter God invocation.  It involves a treck
             through the winter forest, trudging through snow until you
             find the lone pine tree in the clearing in the heart of the
