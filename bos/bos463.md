              CompuServe online Yule Ritual, 1990

              (8-2,DragonHart) Relax....let the worries of the day dissolve
                   into the earth under your feet.  Breath deeply.  This is a
                   journey, sacred and magical.  Prepare yourself for that
                   journey. 
                   * 
                   Yule is a time of change.  Death and rebirth are the  
                   themes that this holiday brings to us.  We enter this sacred
                   time anxious for the birth and growth of the Sun God.  We
                   naturally go through many changes during this time.  We make
                   resolutions to do better, to give up things that keep us
                   from growing.
                   *
                   In our mind's eye we draw a circle of Power.  Our blade
                   travels at astounding speeds, dividing us from the rest of
                   the natural world.  We are set apart, between worlds. 
                   *
                   Taking the chalice of water, we sprinkle the circle,  
                   feeling the cool liquid on our fingers.  We begin to feel
                   the cleansing power of our Mother's blood.  The sprinkling
                   finished, we return the chalice to the altar. 
                   * 
                   The smoke from the censor curls playfully around your
                   fingers as you reach to pick it up.  Breath deep of the
                   sweet Frankincense and Myrhh as you walk the boundries of
                   the circle with it.  Let the scent drive away all negativity
                   in you.  When you have finished your sacred task, place the
                   censor in it's place on the altar. 
                   * 
                   Pause a moment to notice the unlit altar candle.
