                  Footprints in the Chamber - Towards a Quantum Qabbala, 
                                       by Fra.: +0- 
           
          The Qabbala has through the ages been used as a directory towards 
          the understanding of the universe and man`s relationship to it. 
          Since former Aeons of magick have had their perceptions rooted in 
          the observance of simple cause and effect relationships, the Qabbala 
          itself, having attained its nascence in the earlier traditions, was 
          unfortunately bogged down by this limited apprehension of the 
          universe. Here mathematics as used in a more or less Pythagorean 
          context provide a sort of key with which to approach the 
          unfathomable nature of human consciousness. 
           
          To this very day there are groups which still adhere to and openly 
          practice the more traditional ramifications of Qabbalistic 
          principles which are still firmly rooted in the mire of Nineteenth 
          Century Newton-sewed-it-all-up-there-are-no-more-mysteries physics. 
          But of course, owing to the leaps and bounds acquired by a very 
          unpredictable but consistent quantum model of reality as observed in 
          our laboratories, this simplistic view is necessarily obsolete. We 
          no longer live, we have learned (if indeed we ever did) in a simple 
          cause and effect universe where the source can always be gleaned 
          from observable effect. For the same reasons, Newtonian-based magic 
          must give way to a more quantum model. Newton`s apple must now take 
          into consideration Heisenberg`s Uncertainty Principle. The secret 
          wisdom must follow suit towards quantumization. 
           
          Another unfortunate tendency of some modern practioners of Qabbala 
          is to continue to regard everything from the standpoint of the 
          Demiurge, Yahweh, which of course is the basis of the now obsolete 
          (and dangerous) Judeo-Christian foundation of religious thought 
          which has held western civilization in its thrall for about two 
          thousand years. Personally I find it amazing that modern 
          practioners, who despite no real Semitic disposition still practice 
          an unmistakably orthodox Jewish mysticism. It was Aleister Crowley, 
          that great Qabbalistic agent provocateur, who initiated the process 
          of liberating the Qabbala from its otherwise Judaic orientation. 
          (This is not anti-semitism but a necessary step towards individual 
          development. It must also be stated that a Qabbala had been in use 
          centuries earlier by the Egyptians. The Jews merely adopted it to 
          their own religious precepts. They didn`t invent it. The actual 
          origin most likely predates Egyptian history.) 
           
          Crowley emphasized that the enlightened magician must, after careful 
          study and application of his knowledge, develop his own Qabbalistic 
          framework. By virtue of this the magician has arrived at a more 
          chaotic paradigm in opposition to a purely empirical view. Crowley, 
          by adapting the Qabbala to a Thelemic context initiated that first 
          leap forward into the quantum age. Thus, the foundation for a more 
          quantum/chaotic system was lain. 
           







                         Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 

                                                                             282


          I would like now to redefine the secret wisdom in terms of 
          quantumization as follows: 
          &quot;The Qabbala is a table of observed synchronicities wherein multi- 
          dimensional potentia overlap into the field of perception implying a 
          correlation/interaction as perceived on a three-dimensional plane.&quot; 
          The sum of the parts of the whole is determined by conceptual 
          visualization and the observer`s ostensible observation thereof. It 
          is therefore merely a perceptual tool for perceiving hidden meaning 
          in the world determined entirely by the perceived-perception of the 
          perciper (in the language of Satre), which will alter its form and 
          content (via expansion and contradiction) according to the 
          percipere`s own innate tendencies. 
           
          The qabbala is no longer merely a mathematical construct of an 
          ordered universe as conceived by divine will. Instead it becomes a 
          kind of computerized network of extra-sensory information. Even the 
          idea of a prima causa itself may be inadequate as well. This idea is 
          based solely upon a linear time frame and is therefore a corollary 
          of our erroneous perception of time whose actual nature may tend 
          more towards the cyclical. Primitive man, for example was very well 
          aware of this fact, and acted in accordance with it. (This may have 
          to do with primitive people being more in tune with their own 
          circadian rhythms. This expresses a more lunar-intuitive cycle 
          rather than our own solar one.) If perception of time is based upon 
          natural rhythms which effect the body coupled with our observance of 
          nature, then our concept of time is entirely contrary to what nature 
          itself is telling us. We are thus unaligned with a proper time 
          framework. Since a cycle is essentially a circle, no beginning or 
          ending can be found. And, it is already been theorized that there 
          are other dimensions of reality in which time as we know it (in a 
          durational, linear sense of perception) simply cannot exist. 
           
          The universe has again and again defied our attempts a definable 
          order upon it. Yet, mysteriously it does seem to act intelligently, 
          even though this cannot be grasped by a rigid point A to point B 
          structure. What emerges is a kind of chaotic mandala structure, and 
          it is the task of quantum qabbalism to apprehend, as much as is 
          possible, the interior of this structure. This opens the doors to 
          practical mysticism as opposed to impractical mysticism. The qabbala 
          must then be updated to accommodate this vital realization in regard 
          to its properties of being able to regulate perceptive awareness via 
          interacting forces springing from more or less hidden dimensions 
          whose effect is known but not the cause. 















                         Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 

                                                                             283

           
          The understanding of the intention of creation is a product of the 
          mind of the qabbalist himself. The fabric of reality is thereby 
          flexible, effected by his own experience of it, and in turn, this 
          experience determines his perception of it, which is altered by the 
          interaction of these elements, more clearly understood as a 
          transaction. In other words, one perceives his environment and that 
          environment by virtue of one`s perception of it begins to act 
          accordingly to the reality model which is believed to be true. This 
          could be described as a kind of Copenhagen Interpretation as applied 
          to qabbalistic principles. The qabbalist then shares a unique 
          position of receiving qabbalistic impressions via observable 
          systematic synchronicities by means of inclination represented in 
          his own psyche. These impressions will translate back as meaningful 
          data insofar as the transaction between observer and the observed 
          becomes enacted. His perception modifies the universe and in turn, 
          the universe modifies his perception. (This can serve as a 
          representation of the union of microprosopus and macroprosopus.) The 
          feedback of this required information will be meaningful to him 
          alone as it is a byproduct of his own psychic field. He becomes a 
          kind of decoder of esoteric information which he has learned to 
          process. 
           
          From this quantum/chaos framework the qabbala can be regarded as a 
          four (or five) dimensional transaction as revealed in the mundane 
          world, whereby an enriched quality of information provides the key 
          to a higher understanding of the universe and of oneself, provided 
          the person in question is capable of processing this information. 
          From this perspective, ghosts, poltergeists, and other enigmas of 
          paranormal phenomena can be understood as failed communication or 
          remnants of a highly coded system which hasn`t been solved. The 
          problem arises when one dimension fails to adequately &quot;translate&quot; 
          into another. You might term this the Tower of Babel Effect. The 
          information being received is misinterpreted due to inadequate tools 
          of reception and perhaps an inability to use tools properly. There 
          is also a basic misunderstanding of what this information means and 
          to what extent the source can be determined. This is a little like 
          trying to demonstrate fourth dimension physics by a purely three 
          dimensional means. The instances of paranormal phenomena as 
          described above, may be due to a discrepancy of overlapping 
          dimensions which allows for a greater margin of error which impedes 
          effective communication between the dimensions themselves. One is 
          reminded of Plato`s parable of the cave, wherein the shadows of the 
          things observed on the wall of the cave are mistaken for reality 
          itself. Granted, a shadow does resemble the object projecting it, 
          but it is hardly the object itself. It is the task of the quantum 
          qabbalist to make allowances for this margin of interpretive 
          miscalculation by preparing for it in advance and thus integrating 
          this possible glitch into his qabbalistic computer. He makes 
          allowances for this possible occurrence of organizational entropy and 
          thus he is able to use it to his advantage. 








                         Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 

                                                                             284

           
          The idea of a qabbala based upon an exploration of prima causa is no 
          longer valid in the quantum age. The quantumized qabbalist learns to 
          regard himself in the mirror of chaos. For him, the old Gnostic 
          dictum of &quot;there is no part of me which is not of the gods&quot;, is 
          literally true. His &quot;Tree of Life&quot; is based squarely upon the 
          apprehension of his own enigmatic existence. He is more interested 
          in a practical application of his qabbalistic ideas and principles 
          for himself and others, than a cosmological game of hide and seek 
          wherein one searches for a prima causa &quot;God&quot; figure. But even for 
          this, he has an explanation: By careful observation of himself 
          within the mirror of chaos he has learned that the miracle of 
          creation is somehow a byproduct of his own consciousness and that he 
          has played an inexplicable role in the very act itself. (&quot;Did ye not 
          know that ye were gods?&quot;) Joyously he has found that the tracks of 
          God etched across the illimitable sands of time in the accelerated 
          particle chambers of his own expanding consciousness. Thus has he 
          learned to adore the divine mystery of existence donning the masks 
          of creation.
