# The Origins of Halloween

#### copyright © 1989, Rowan Moonstone

In recent years, there have been a number of pamphlets and books put out
be various Christian organizations dealing with the origins of
modern-day Halloween customs.

Being a Witch myself, and a student of the ancient Celts from whom we
get this holiday, I have found these pamphlets woefully inaccurate and
poorly researched. A typical example of this information is contained in
the following quote from the pamphlet entitled "What's Wrong with
Halloween?" by Russell K. Tardo. "The Druids believed that on October
31st, the last day of the year by the ancient Celtic calendar, the lord
of death gathered together the souls of the dead who had been made to
enter bodies of animals, and decided what forms they should take the
following year. Cats were held sacred because it was believed that they
were once human beings ... We see that this holiday has its origin,
basis and root in the occultic Druid celebration of the dead. Only they
called it 'Samhain', who was the Lord of the Dead (a big
demon)".<sup>1</sup> When these books and pamphlets cite sources at all,
they usually list the Encyclopedia Britannica, Encyclopedia Americana,
and the World Book Encyclopedia. The Britannica and the Americana make
no mention of cats, but do indeed list Samhain as the Lord of Death,
contrary to Celtic scholars, and list no references. The World Book
mentions the cats and calls Samhain the Lord of Death, and lists as its
sources several children's books (hardly what one could consider
scholarly texts, and, of course, themselves citing no references).

In an effort to correct some of this erroneous information, I have
researched the religious life of the ancient Celtic peoples and the
survivals of that religious life in modern times. Listed below are some
of the most commonly asked questions concerning the origins and customs
of Halloween. Following the questions is a lengthy bibliography where
the curious reader can go to learn more about this holiday than space in
this small pamphlet permits.

1.  Where does Halloween come from?

    Our modern celebration of Halloween is a descendent of the ancient
    Celtic festival called "Samhain". The word is pronounced "sow-in",
    with "sow" rhyming with "cow".

2.  What does "Samhain" mean?

    The "Irish-English Dictionary" published by the Irish Texts Society
    defines the word as follows: "Samhain, All Hallowtide, the feast of
    the dead in Pagan and Christian times, signalling the close of
    harvest and the initiation of the winter season, lasting till May,
    during which troop swere quartered. Fairies were imagined as
    particularly active at this season. From it, the half-year is
    reckoned. Also called Feile Moingfinne (Snow Goddess)."<sup>2</sup>
    The "Scottish Gaelic Dictionary" defines it as "Hallowtide. The
    Feast of All Souls. Sam + Fuin = end of summer."<sup>3</sup>
    Contrary to the information published by many organizations, there
    is no archaeological or literary evidence to indicate that Samhain
    was a deity. Eliade's "Encyclopedia of Religion" states as follows:
    "The Eve and day of Samhain were characterized as a time when the
    barriers between the human and supernatural worlds were broken...
    Not a festival honoring any particular Celtic deity, Samhain
    acknowledged the entire spectrum of nonhuman forces that roamed the
    earth during that period."<sup>4</sup> The Celtic Gods of the dead
    were Gwynn ap Nudd for the British and Arawn for the Welsh. The
    Irish did not have a "Lord of Death" as such.

3.  Why was the end of summer of significance to the Celts?

    The Celts were a pastoral people as opposed to an agricultural
    people. The end of summer was significant to them because it meant
    the time of year when the structure of their lives changed
    radically. The cattle were brought down from the summer pastures in
    the hills and the people were gathered into the houses for the long
    winter nights of story-telling and handicrafts.

4.  What does it have to do with a festival of the dead?

    The Celts believed that when people died, they went to a land of
    eternal youth and happiness called Tír na nOg. They did not have the
    concept of Heaven and Hell that the Christian Church later brought
    into the land. The dead were sometimes believed to be dwelling with
    the Fairy Folk, who lived in the numerous mounds, or sidhe,
    (pronounced "shee" or "sh-thee") that dotted the Irish and Scottish
    countryside. Samhain was the new year to the Celts. In the Celtic
    belief system, turning points such as the time between one day and
    the next, the meeting of sea and shore or the turning of one year
    into the next, were seen as magickal times. The turning of the year
    was the most potent of these times. This was the time when the "veil
    between the worlds" was at its thinnest and the living could
    communicate with their beloved dead in Tír na nOg.

5.  What about the aspects of "evil" that we associate with the night
    today?

    The Celts did not have demons and devils in their belief system. The
    fairies, however, were often considered hostile and dangerous to
    humans because they were seen as being resentful of man taking over
    their land. On this night, they would sometimes trick humans into
    becoming lost in the fairy mounds where they would be trapped
    forever. After the coming of the Christians to the Celtic lands,
    certain of the folk saw the fairies as those angels who had sided
    neither with God or with Lucifer in their dispute and thus were
    condemned to walk the Earth until Judgment Day.<sup>5</sup> In
    addition to the fairies, many humans were abroad on this night
    causing mischief. Since this night belonged neither to one year or
    the other, Celtic folk believed that chaos reigned and the people
    would engage in "horseplay and practical jokes".<sup>6</sup> This
    also served as a final outlet for high spirits before the gloom of
    winter set in.

6.  What about "trick or treat"?

    During the course of these hijinks, many of the people would imitate
    the fairies and go from house to house begging for treats. Failure
    to supply the treats would usually result in practical jokes being
    visited on the owner of the house. Since the fairies were abroad on
    this night, an offering of food or milk was frequently left for them
    on the steps of the house so the homeowner could gain the blessing
    of the "good folk" for the coming year. Many of the households would
    also leave out a "dumb supper" for the spirits of the
    departed.<sup>7</sup> The folks who were abroad in the night
    imitating the fairies would sometimes carry turnips carved to
    represent faces. This is the origin of our modern Jack-o-lantern.

7.  Was there any special significance of cats to the Celts?

    According to Katherine Briggs in "Nine Lives: Cats in Folklore", the
    Celts associated cats with the Cailleach Bheur, or Blue Hag of
    Winter. "She was a nature goddess, who herded the deer as her
    cattle. The touch of her staff drove the leaves off the trees and
    brought snow and harsh weather."<sup>8</sup> Dr. Anne Ross addresses
    the use of divine animals in her book "Pagan Celtic Britain" and has
    this to say about cats: "Cats do not play a large role in Celtic
    mythology ... the evidence for the cat as an important cult animal
    in Celtic mythology is slight".<sup>9</sup> She cites as supporting
    evidence the lack of archaeological artifacts and literary
    references in surviving works of mythology.

8.  Was this also a religious festival?

    Yes. Celtic religion was very closely tied to the Earth. The great
    legends are concerned with momentous happenings which took place
    around the time of Samhain. Many of the great battles and legends of
    kings and heroes center on this night. Many of the legends concern
    the promotion of fertility of the Earth and the insurance of the
    continuance of the lives of the people through the dark winter
    season.

9.  How was the religious festival observed?

    Unfortunately, we know very little about that. W.G. Wood-Martin, in
    his book "Traces of the Elder Faiths of Ireland", states: "There is
    comparatively little trace of the religion of the Druids now
    discoverable, save in the folklore of the peasantry and the
    references relative to it that occur in ancient and authentic Irish
    manuscripts are, as far as present appearances go, meager and
    insufficient to support anything like a sound theory for full
    development of the ancient religion."<sup>10</sup> The Druids were
    the priests of the Celtic peoples. They passed on their teachings by
    oral tradition instead of committing them to writing, so when they
    perished, most of their religious teachings were lost. We do know
    that this festival was characterized as one of the four great "Fire
    Festivals" of the Celts. Legends tell us that on this night all the
    hearth fires in Ireland were extinguished and then re-lit from the
    central fire of the Druids at Tlachtga, 12 miles from the royal hill
    of Tara. This fire was kindled from "need fire" which had been
    generated by the friction of rubbing two sticks together, as opposed
    to more conventional methods (such as the flint-and-steel method)
    common in those days.<sup>11</sup> The extinguishing of the fires
    symbolized the "dark half" of the year, and the re-kindling from the
    Druidic fires was symbolic of the returning life hoped for and
    brought about through the ministrations of the priesthood.

10. What about sacrifices?

    Animals were certainly killed at this time of year. This was the
    time to "cull" from the herds those animals which were not desired
    for breeding purposes for the next year. Most certainly, some of
    these would have been done in a ritual manner for the use of the
    priesthood.

11. Were humans sacrificed?

    Scholars are sharply divided on this account, with about half
    believing that it took place and half doubting its veracity. Caesar
    and Tacitus certainly tell tales of the human sacrifices of the
    Celts, but Nora Chadwick points out in her book "The Celts" that "it
    is not without interest that the Romans themselves had abolished
    human sacrifice not long before Caesar's time, and references to the
    practice among various barbarian peoples have certain overtones of
    self-righteousness. There is little direct archaeological evidence
    relevant to Celtic sacrifice."<sup>12</sup> Indeed, there is little
    reference to this practice in Celtic literature. The only surviving
    story echoes the tale of the Minotaur in Greek legend: the
    Fomorians, a race of evil giants said to inhabit portions of Ireland
    before the coming of the Tuatha Dé Danann (or "people of the Goddess
    Danu"), demanded the sacrifice of 2/3 of the corn, milk and
    first-born children of the Fir Bolg, or human inhabitants of
    Ireland. The Tuatha Dé Danann ended this practice in the second
    battle of Moy Tura, which incidentally, took place on Samhain. It
    should be noted, however, that this story appears in only one
    (relatively modern) manuscript from Irish literature, and that
    manuscript, the "Dinnsenchus", is known to be a collection of
    fables. According to P.W. Joyce in Vol. 2 of his "Social History of
    Ancient Ireland", "Scattered everywhere through our ancient
    literature, both secular and ecclesiastical, we find abundant
    descriptions and details of the rites and superstitions of the pagan
    Irish; and in no place -- with this single exception -- do we find a
    word or hint pointing to human sacrifice to pagan gods or
    idols."<sup>13</sup>

12. What other practices were associated with this season?

    Folk tradition tells us of many divination practices associated with
    Samhain. Among the most common were divinations dealing with
    marriage, weather and the coming fortunes for the year. These were
    performed via such methods as ducking for apples and apple peeling.
    Ducking for apples was a marriage divination. The first person to
    bite an apple would be the first to marry in the coming year. Apple
    peeling was a divination to see how long your life would be. The
    longer the unbroken apple peel, the longer your life was destined to
    be.<sup>14</sup> In Scotland, people would place stones in the ashes
    of the hearth before retiring for the night. Anyone whose stone had
    been disturbed during the night was said to be destined to die
    during the coming year.

13. How did these ancient Celtic practices come to America?

    When the potato crop in Ireland failed, many of the Irish people,
    modern descendants of the Celts, emigrated to America bringing with
    them their folk practices which were remnants of the Celtic festival
    observances.

14. We in America view this as a harvest festival. Did the Celts also
    view it as such?

    Yes. The Celts had 3 harvests. Aug 1, or Lammas, was the first
    harvest, when the first fruits were offered to the Gods in thanks.
    The Fall Equinox was the true harvest. This was when the bulk of the
    crops would be brought in. Samhain was the final harvest of the
    year. Anything left on the vines or in the fields after this date
    was considered blasted by the fairies ("pu'ka") and unfit for human
    consumption.

15. Does anyone today celebrate Samhain as a religious observance?

    Yes. Many followers of various pagan religions, such as Druidism and
    Wicca, observe this day as a religious festival. They view it as a
    memorial day for their dead friends and family, much as the
    mainstream US does the national Memorial Day holiday in May. It is
    still a night to practice various forms of divination concerning
    future events. It is also considered a time to wrap up old projects,
    take stock of one's life and initiate new projects for the coming
    year. As the winter season is approaching, it is a good time to do
    studying on research projects, and also a good time to begin
    handwork such as sewing, leatherworking, woodworking etc., for Yule
    gifts later in the year. And while "satanists" are using this
    holiday as their own, this is certainly not the only example of a
    holiday (or even religious symbols) being "borrowed" from an older
    religion by a newer one.

16. Does this involve human or animal sacrifice?

    Absolutely *NOT*! Hollywood to the contrary, blood sacrifice is not
    practiced by modern followers of Wicca or Druidism. There may be
    some people who *think* they are practicing Wicca by performing
    blood sacrificing but this is *not* condoned by reputable
    practitioners of today's neo-Pagan religions.
