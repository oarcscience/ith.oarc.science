# Gender and Nature in Contemporary NeoPaganism

                                      
                                      
                               by Salamantis
                        Email: joedees@bellsouth.net
                                      
       In recent decades, several social and political movements have 
           had profound impacts upon the popular Western psyche. 
        Collectively, they pose a powerful challenge to religiously 
        grounded relational paradigms which until recently have been 
       accepted almost without question. These movements include the 
    human rights trio (ethnic/racial civil rights, lesbian/gay rights and 
                      feminism) and environmentalism.
                                      
      The last two of these, feminism and environmentalism, have been 
      converging to the degree that a common discipline, ecofeminism, 
      has been born. Although some affinities exist between these two 
      and the others, the only solid connection seems to be the choice 
     by some feminists of lesbianism on ideological grounds in spite of 
      their personal sexual preferences. What could the womenÌs rights 
          movement have in common with the attempt to preserve and 
      protect our planetary ecology which the homosexual and nonwhite 
      rights movements do not share? To answer this question, we must 
       take a look at the paradigm they are all opposing, and in what 
                        ways each of them oppose it.
                                      
                            Our Present Paradigm
                                      
      This paradigm is drawn from the moral laws set down in the holy 
            texts of the religions comprising mainstream Western 
            Monotheism. These religions mainly include Judaism, 
      Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism; their texts include the 
      Bible, the Koran and the Zend Avesta. For purposes of simplicity 
             and brevity, we shall call this the JCIZ paradigm.
                                      
       JCIZ postulates a single omniscient, omnipotent and relatively 
       benevolent male deity (Jahweh, Jehovah, God or Lord, Allah or 
          Ahura Mazda), who created and populated the world but is 
     essentially transcendent with respect to it. This deity is opposed 
         by another somewhat less knowing and powerful, relatively 
      malevolent male deity (Lucifer, the Devil, Shaitan or Ahriman), 
     who is also essentially supernatural. These two opposed forces of 
       good and evil, light and darkness, contend with each other by 
      intervening in our affairs. Each of us shall spend eternity with 
      whichever one he or she allies with; in any case this earth is a 
        temporary inconvenience, unimportant in the greater order of 
    things. It is in our interest to ally ourselves with the Ïgood guyÓ, 
       and we know how to do this because HeÌs thoughtfully sent us a 
        male savior or prophet or avatar (Moses, Jesus, Mohammed or 
                       Zarathustra) to so inform us.
                                      
        We are now in a position to understand the special affinity 
          between feminism and environmentalism. Homosexuality is 
          condemned and slavery condoned in the JCIZ, but if these 
           tendencies were reversed, it would not compromise the 
       underpinnings of the theological structure; gay/lesbian rights 
     identical to those of straights and white/nonwhite equality are no 
     metaphysical threat to the integrity of the system. The religious 
      ramifications of feminism and environmentalism, however, strike 
    it to its very core. By criticizing the consequences of following the 
     JCIZ, they indict as immoral or unwise the premises upon which it 
         is based, and do so from the perspective of an alternative 
          paradigm which derives from many pagan sources past and 
                present, but which is crystallized in Wicca.
                                      
                                  Feminism
                                      
    In the JCIZ, all deities are male, the first human is male, and any 
      central prophets or saviors are male. In the cosmic play, women 
        are relegated to the roles of dupe, slave, rebellious whore, 
       broodmare and submissive saint. Mary DalyÌs dictum that if God 
     is male, the male is God has the existential corollary, within the 
       JCIZ, of reducing females to nothing. In order to follow GodÌs 
     plan, women must submit to their husbandsÌ rule in particular, and 
     to male authority in general. Men may have to attend the school of 
       hard knocks, but women are stuck with their homework. They are 
    to raise their many children but not their voices, for fear of getting 
        knocked about themselves. This excision of the feminine from 
    spiritual significance and their resulting societal subservience has 
       provoked, within many contemporary women, a soul alienation of 
        Marxian proportions. Revolt against the predominance of this 
       divine chain of being has followed, and the guerillas have not 
        been exclusively female. Some men have come to feel cramped 
         and pigeonholed in the role of overseer on the domination 
      plantation and degraded and ashamed of what is expected of them 
      there. They have therefore joined the rebellion against the JCIZ 
     gender hierarchy, agreeing with Martin Luther King that you canÌt 
       hold folks down in a ditch unless you climb down in there with 
        them. As women and men come to the practical conclusion that 
     only equality of rights, responsibilities and opportunities works, 
      however, they also tend to come to the spiritual conclusion that 
      this is true because the sexes equally approach divinity. This, 
      however, would require deity to be comprised of masculinity and 
     femininity in equal measure, which of course directly contradicts 
                                 the JCIZ.
                                      
                              Environmentalism
                                      
     In the JCIZ, the Creator packed a hostile and bountiful world like 
       a reluctant lunchbox for fallen humanity (read man) to suffer, 
       endure, dominate, subdue and exploit for his own benefit. This 
     divine license for exploitation without regard to consequences in 
     the name of greed has borne bitter fruit. Because we have not held 
       our common home in reverence, or honored her as sacred to us, 
     we have felt free to pollute, pillage, rape and otherwise profane 
      her. Yet, after fouling our own nest, we seem surprised to find 
           ourselves surrounded by human filth, with the blood of 
       extinguished comrade species crying out inconsolably from the 
      bleak bare ground. We are coming painfully to the understanding 
    that the earth is our source and foundation, and that poisoning and 
          impoverishing her can only hasten our own hollow demise. 
        However, the grasping of the fact that we are only a part of 
         something much older, wiser, grander and more complex than 
         ourselves draws us inexorably to an experience of awe and 
      sublimity in the presence of the sheer marvel of it. We begin to 
     see ourselves as tiny threads, which, by some miracle, are able to 
     sense the weave of a gigantic dancing tapestry (and the reality is 
       much more wondrous than that). The earth becomes hallowed for 
     us. But this contradicts the JCIZ premise that it is transcendent 
          Deity which is holy, not a nature which, compared to the 
                   supernatural, must remain substandard.
                                      
                               ForbiddenFruit
                                      
        Ecological degradation may be divided into natural resource 
      depletion and biosphere pollution, but both have overpopulation 
       as a root cause. Overpopulation drives us like lemmings to mow 
     our global lungs for farmland, lumber and cattle pasture, sapping 
      species diversity in the process. It drives us to strip-mine our 
    eroding soil to build skyscrapers, cars and soda cans. It drives us 
          to burn our fossil fuels, overheating our atmosphere and 
      decimating our ozone sunscreen for the sake of light, mobility, 
         plastic containers and air-conditioned comfort for a small 
     percentage of our teeming billions. It drives us to turn our over-
        fished oceans into toxic cesspools when our rivers bear our 
           pesticides, factory byproducts and sewage to the seas. 
      Furthermore, the resulting competition for room and resources on 
    a shrinking sphere has led our infant race to nurse the barrel of the 
                                nuclear gun.
                                      
         It is ecologically imperative that we control our rate of 
       reproduction generally, and the fundamental pillar of feminism 
      that women must have the right to control their own reproduction 
     individually. To this dovetailing of the calls of personal freedom 
        and global necessity, the JCIZ responds with an iron demand 
       frozen for thousands of years in the face of catastrophically 
         changing circumstances; you must be fruitful and multiply.
                                      
                                Ecofeminism
                                      
        The realization that birth control is both a feminist and an 
          environmental issue is one of many pattern matches which 
     ecofeminists have found. They follow the clue given by the phrase 
      ÎMother NatureÌ to the conclusion that women and the earth have 
         both been victimized by the same attitudes of subjection, 
    rapaciousness, violation, penetration of virgin territory, stripping, 
       despoiling and defloration. They consider this an unfortunate 
      result of the separation of the sexes into godlike, transcendent 
         man and earthy, immanent woman, into man as mind and woman 
      as body, found in the JCIZ. This partition, for ecofeminists, is 
        based on the differing positions of the sexes with regard to 
      childbirth; men observe, women participate. Women also, like the 
     earth, produce food, and can be planted with seed when in season; 
           hence the ancient occurrence of the term ÎplowingÌ for 
                                intercourse.
                                      
     Sexist theological Cartesianism, however, is untenable; the JCIZÌs 
    gender-based spirit/flesh dichotomy has been an injurious illusion. 
        Self-aware parts of nature are still woven into the web they 
        perceive. Mind, whether abstract or concrete, and of either 
       gender, is a bodily based, earthly and evolutionarily emergent 
                                phenomenon.
                                      
        The main division within ecofeminism is between ÎgenderÌ and 
       ÎnatureÌ ecofeminists. The ÎgenderÌ ecofeminists believe that 
      male-female relationships are the source of a domination pattern 
     that is generalized to apply to culture-nature relationships, and 
    that if we replace it with an egalitarian sexual partnership pattern, 
      our environmental abuse will stop. ÎNatureÌ ecofeminists believe 
     just the opposite; that replacing the egocentric, exploitative and 
      uncaring attitudes underlying environmental abuse with valuing, 
           consequence based stewardship will repair male-female 
      relationships by osmosis. I think that the domination pattern is 
       imprinted during child-rearing, and that to end it, we have to 
           embrace noncoercive methods of socializing our young.
                                      
                        The Challenge of Neopaganism
                                      
                           Neopaganism Generally
                                      
      The Neopagan alternatives to the JCIZ paradigm trace their roots 
       to prehistoric Eurasian and African tribal and shamanic nature 
       religions, and count the Amerindian and Australian aboriginal 
         traditions as siblings. From them, Pagans have taken their 
     reverence for the earth and their celebration of the more feminine 
       principles of divinity. They generally create sacred space by 
      casting a circle (which is the intersection between a sanctified 
       sphere and the ground), and calling the four directions, which 
     correspond to the four elements, and to the divisions of a day, a 
     moon cycle, a year and a lifetime, and much else. Their holy days 
     fall on the solstices and the equinoxes, on the midpoints between 
     them (the cross-quarters), and/or on full moons. In addition, they 
      honor personal rites of passage; such as birth, a naming of the 
      child (sometimes called wiccaning), puberty, marriage (known as 
         handfasting), menopause (croning), and death. Contemporary 
       neopagan groups include the Fellowship of Isis, Ar n Draiocht 
       Fein (Our Own Druidism), the Church of all Worlds, Asatru and 
                     the Church of the Eternal Source.
                                      
                             Wicca Specifically
                                      
    All the above is true of Wicca, but when casting their circles most 
       also call the Earth Mother, Sky Father, and Center, this last 
    representing both the individual selves of the participants and the 
       common center they create by joining together. They also thank 
           and dismiss them when they open their circles upon the 
         conclusion of their ritual workings.Wicca follows a gender-
         complementary immanent duotheism comprised of a God and a 
       Goddess; for Wicca, deity is double and non-transcendent. The 
     distinctions between them entail neither mutual hostility nor the 
      subservience of either to the other, but instead require the co-
          presence in dynamic symmetry of these differing yet equi-
          primordial principles for circumstances to proceed. The 
    fundamentalist belief in the actual existence of these deities is not 
      a prerequisite for becoming Wiccan. In fact, many, if not most, 
       Wiccans view the Earth Mother and Sky Father as archetypes in 
      the Jungian sense, and as lenses through which to apprehend, and 
      grasp in concrete, human-friendly terms, a totality which is too 
      vast and ineffable to be circumscribed by finite minds. Wiccans 
       consider all Goddesses and Gods throughout history as cultural 
       manifestations of these principles, revel in the diversity of 
       expression that they find, and borrow whatever they find that 
     works for them. In this sense, Wicca does not enslave and use its 
    adherents; rather it is the case that Wicca is made use of by them, 
         as a spiritual tool with which to focus their passions and 
      intentions upon the realizations of their plans and desires. The 
        conceptions and attributes surrounding these deities are not 
    inscribed for all time in any holy text, but are flexible, for Wicca 
      is an evolving, pragmatic religion with little dogmatic baggage.
                                      
    Wicca's central ritual, the Great Rite, consists of dipping a dagger 
        in a chalice of wine in symbolic intercourse. The Christian 
       Communion, in contrast, is symbolic cannibalism.Wicca has one 
        major law, the Law of Three (any action, whether well or ill 
         intentioned, is returned to its source threefold), and one 
        commandment, the Wiccan Rede (Îif it harms none, do what you 
          willÌ). While these admonishments do emphasize personal 
         freedom, they link it to personal responsibility, and the 
     consequences of following them are a strict self-discipline, since 
       one is expected to strive not to harm oneself, others, or the 
        biosphere we share. Their more magickal practices include a 
     Santeria-like invocation of the masculine principle by the priest 
      and of the feminine principle by the priestess (the Drawing Down 
          of the Sun or Moon), and Raising the Cone of Power. This 
    practice involves an entering of the group into a shamanic state of 
      consciousness, usually by means of some combination of dancing, 
      chanting and drumming, preparatory to attempts at divination or 
                               spellcasting.
                                      
         The Earth Mother represents the foundation or substrate of 
      change; the matter underlying form, the being beneath becoming. 
      She is omnipresent, although aspects of her may undergo periodic 
         change. She never dies. The feminine principle of divinity 
          encompasses the cyclical-intuitive, synthesizing, fecund-
      formative, nourishing aspect, with its emphases on the personal 
       and collective dream worlds, and on relatedness.The Sky Father 
      represents the changes of form that must occur in the life cycle 
     and food chain. He withdraws and returns, and never lingers. He is 
     the God of the inseparability of hunter and prey, and of the cycle 
     of vegetation. He is born of the Mother, grows, flowers and dies, 
       to be reborn of his own seed the following year. The masculine 
      principle of divinity encompasses the linear-logical, analyzing, 
           fertilizing aspect, with its emphases on ego, task and 
    individuality.A combination of these traits is preferable to either 
     alone, and all people are considered to have their own particular 
     ratios of these attribute sets; their own yin-yang or anima-animus 
                                   blend.
                                      
          Modern Wicca publicly began in 1949 when Gerald Gardner 
      published ÏHigh MagicÌs AidÓ, a book of Wiccan ritual disguised 
        as historical fiction. He then, in collaboration with Doreen 
          Valiente, published ÏWitchcraft TodayÓ in 1954 and ÏThe 
        Meaning of WitchcraftÓ in 1959. Although other Wiccan forms 
        exist, Gardnerian Wicca and an offshoot (Alexandrian Wicca, 
     after its founder Alex Sanders) remain the core Wiccan traditions. 
         Other important Wiccan theorists include Janet and Stewart 
                      Farrar, Starhawk and Z Budapest.
                                      
                  WiccanTheo/alogy and the Foundations of 
                       Feminism and Environmentalism
                                      
     In a religion in which the God and the Goddess are equi-potential 
        (possess complementary and equal status), gender equality is 
         mandated rather than forbidden. Freedom of societally and 
     planetarily responsible choice belongs to all. In a religion that 
       urges its adherents to love the earth as a mother, rather than 
     resenting and coveting her as a rich, conquerable hostile kingdom, 
    children would be raised from birth to treat her with restraint and 
       respect, and to pass her on to their children in as pristine a 
      condition as possible. There is, in fact, a kind of Wiccan Eden 
       myth; a vision of a prehistoric peaceful eco-friendly agrarian 
      matriarchy which was overthrown by males banished for violence, 
      who banded together to conquer and enslave their former society 
       and pillage its lands. This Edenic vision is more admired than 
       believed. Most Wiccans desire a ÎreturnÌ to this Eden, even if 
                 humanity has never in reality been there.
                                      
       Feminists and environmentalists, particularly ecofeminists and 
     deep ecologists, share this vision for the future; it is what they 
     strive for. It is therefore to be expected that many of them would 
     appropriate a belief system possessing sensibilities so in harmony 
     with their hopes, goals, desires and dreams. If the Wiccan Utopia 
    is theirs also, adoption seems eminently reasonable. In fact, these 
        movements receive both support and guidance from Wicca, and 
                            give both in return.
                                      
          Wicca and ScienceWiccaÌs attitude toward science is one 
    of intense interest and positive regard, for WiccaÌs perspective of 
     pragmatic self-conscious evolution and its anti-dogmatic character 
      resemble scientific ideals. Science, for Wicca, is attempting to 
     reveal the underlying nature of immanent divinity, and as such is 
         performing a sacred service. In addition, LovelockÌs Gaia 
    hypothesis, that the entire biosphere is an evolving, self-regulating 
          totality, appears to be to Wiccans the beginning of the 
        confirmation of their ecological suspicions, and the recent 
     comparisons of gender, brain structure and cognitive style bolster 
    the validity of their chosen deity attributes. They for the most part 
      accept that humanity creates divinity in its own image, and feel 
    flattered that science is indicating that they in particular are doing 
                              it rather well.
                                      
                                Difficulties
                                      
       WiccaÌs deities form a heterosexual couple, and sex with oneÌs 
     significant other is regarded as a sacrament. This has caused gays 
        and lesbians to sometimes feel uneasy with the energy in the 
      circle. For this reason, some gay men have formed Faerie circles 
        and some lesbians have embraced Dianic Wicca. Straight women 
    will also meet in full moon circles, or esbats, and straight men in 
         wild man groups. Although there are some differences, for 
    instance in the deity or deities invoked, the thaumaturgy, or ritual 
      structure, remains similar throughout. General meetings are held 
       on the sabbats eight times a year, and networking is constant. 
       Wicca and Neopaganism remain far more gay-friendly than JCIZ.
                                      
    Although racial diversity endures as an ideal in Wicca, it is sadly 
      lacking in reality. This failure to rainbow the Craft is deeply 
    disturbing to its members. It is almost certain that the reason for 
     the phenomenon of whitebread Wicca is that, for racial minorities, 
      the intensity and immediacy of their oppressed condition drives 
          gender and ecological concerns to the periphery if their 
       awareness. Also, it only stands to reason that they would feel 
     uncomfortable participating in ritual as the token minority, or at 
      best as one of the few. It is very likely that, despite the best 
     intentions of the other participants, such an experience serves to 
        reinforce, rather than relieve, the awkwardness and sense of 
        difference for which racial minorities would seek religious 
       comfort. Wiccans, having experienced discrimination themselves 
         on the religious front, understand these impediments, and 
                    continue to remain open and hopeful.
                                      
       Lastly, the Wiccan division of deity has inadvertently had the 
        corollary of evolving lists of masculine and feminine gender 
    attributes that seem disturbingly similar to those of the JCIZ, only 
       wrapped in positive-regard packaging. Also, in some cases, the 
       Wiccan backlash against patriarchy has swung the pendulum too 
     far in the opposite direction, subjecting men to the same ridicule 
    and discrimination that the phallocentrists previously reserved for 
        women. Wiccans must be on guard that they do not pigeonhole 
      individuals into these archetypes, and thus descend the slippery 
       slope into the very bigotry and gender expectations that many 
                        have joined Wicca to escape.
