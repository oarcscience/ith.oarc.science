                                           Weaving Webs 
                                          by David Rankine

              The Mantra Web is a very simple and effective technique for using
              sonics in a group. Choose a mantra with a number of syllables
              corresponding to the numbers of operators, eg. IAO for 3 people. The
              operators should link hands, left palm up and right palm down, and
              slowly start to circle clockwise, each vibrating their syllable. As
              this is done the operators should each project a thread of light
              from their Solar Plexus (Manipura chakra) to a central focal point.
              The color(s) of the threads of light should be determined before
              the operation according to its purpose and the current beliefs of
              the operators. As the speed and resonance of the mantra is built up
              over a period of time, so the web is empowered, until a climax is
              reached and the web energy directed by a pre-specified operator to
              its purpose. This is just a sketchy outline of the technique, which
              obviously can be used for much more than this. Some of the more
              common uses for this technique include healing (with the individual
              in the center at the focus, crystals would also boost the energy
              levels); sexual magick (with operator(s) in the center and, if
              possible, the climax timed accordingly); empowering sigils, and so
              on.

              If the operators vibrate their syllable alternately instead of
              together, the mantra will spin around the circle and have a
              positively disorienting effect on the operators.
              It is important that the operators visualize their thread of light
              continuously, and not just when vibrating their mantra syllable. I
              particularly recommend this technique for outdoor use, especially at
              suitably aspected power sites. However, if you are using a stone
              circle or any other site of magick, please do think about what
              aspects the site has, and preferably visit beforehand to achieve
              some rapport with the site.
