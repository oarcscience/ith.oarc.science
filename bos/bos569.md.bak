    functions as they themselves shall determine, subject to approval by the
    board of Directors. The term of office for High Priests and High
    Priestesses shall customarily be for a period of not more than seven
    years, during which time it shall be the duty of such persons to select
    and train their successors. Any High Priest or High Priestess who does
    not step down before this seven year period is up may, at any time after

    community. It shall be the responsibility of the Primate to keep well
    informed enough on all phases of both the Church of All Worlds and
    Paganism/Neo-Paganism as a whole that such duties may always be
    competently and effectively performed. 
                   Section 3: 
    As the Primate is largely an honorific position awarded by the member-
    ship in respect for a person's years of service to the Church of All
    2503

    Worlds, a successor may or may not be chosen upon the discontinuation of
    one Primate's term of office. Should  it be desired, a successor shall
    be chosen by the same method as any other elected official.

    The basic local organizational/congregational unit of the Church of All
    Worlds shall be the nest.  A nest is a group of Church members, with at
    least one member 4th Circle or above, organized in a local area to learn
    about, discuss, and creatively practice the purposes of the Church. 
    Nests shall be largely autonomous units which have agreed to adopt and
    practice the values and purposes of the Church and have, after applying
    to the Board, been granted a charter by the Board of Directors pursuant
    2508

    to a recommendation of the Nest Co-ordinating Council.  
                   Section 2:  
    In order to form a nest, a group of at least three Church members of at
    least 2nd Circle must apply to the Nest Co-ordinating Council for a
    charter as a proto-nest, or Chapter.  Chapter charters are issued a the
    discretion of the Nest Co-ordinating Council.  In order to be granted a
    full Nest Charter, a group must function for at least a year and a day
    and have at least one member who has reached the level of Scion (4th
    Circle).  Granting of a Nest Charter will be by vote of the Board of
    Directors.  
                   Section 3:  
    Nests chartered by the Board of Directors shall be legal subsidiaries of
    the Church of All Worlds as incorporated under the laws of the States of
    Missouri and California.  Nest shall not have the power to incur debt in
    the name of the Church of All Worlds.  
                   Section 4:  
    The Board and Clergy of the Church of All Worlds do not wish to impose
    any doctrinal restraints upon local nests beyond the requirement that
    their activities be in accord with the purpose of the Corporation as
    stated in Article II of these bylaws.  The board and Clergy in fact
    encourage creativity and innovation on the part of all local nests and
    groups in the lawful pursuit of the goals of the Church of All Worlds.
                   Section 5:  
    The Board of Directors does, however, reserve the right to revoke either
    a Chapter or Nest Charter on the recommendation of either the Council of
    the Third Ring or the Nest Co-ordinating Council for one of the
    following reasons: 
         A.  The conduct at its meetings and public functions or in its
    public statements is found to be incompatible with the purposes of the
    Corporation as stated in Article II of these Bylaws, or contrary to the
    laws of the United States or the State of residence of the Nest or
    Chapter; 
         B.  The conduct or statements of the Nest or Chapter in its
    meetings and public functions or in its public statements, in the
    judgement of the Board of Directors, reflects unacceptable discredit on
    the Church of All Worlds, its purposes, members and Clergy; 
         C.  The Board of Directors has reason to believe -- on recommenda-
    tion from either the Council of the Third Ring or the Nest Co-ordinating
    Council -- that the chartered group is not truly functioning as a Nest
    or Chapter in that the contact person of that Nest or Chapter does not
    respond to queries, show evidence of membership or the holding of
    regular meetings or other evidence that the Chartered Nest or Chapter
    is, indeed, functioning as a viable organizational unit of the Church of
    All Worlds.   

         ARTICLE XII Meetings  
                   Section l: 
    General meetings of the Corporation shall be held in conjunction with
    the first yearly meeting of the Board of Directors. Regular meetings of
    the Board of Directors shall be held quarterly, approximately three
    weeks before cross-quarter Sabbats. The first annual meeting shall
    propose the meeting dates for the remaining quarters of the year.
    Special meetings may be held whenever deemed necessary. 
                   Section 2: 
    Notice of the Annual Meetings of the General Membership shall be made
    each year at least one month in advance of the date of the meeting by a
    special mailing to all registered members of the Church of at least 2nd
    Circle. Notices of regular meetings of the Board of Directors, together
    2509

    with quarterly subsidiary reports and proposed agenda items, shall be
    sent to members of the Board  two weeks prior to such meetings by the
    Church Secretary. Notice of special Board meetings shall be made as
    early as possible. Notice of regular meetings of other councils shall be
    sent to relevant members two weeks in advance by the appropriate council
    secretary, and notices of special meetings, as early as possible. 
    Meetings of Nest Councils shall be held at least quarterly, the
    frequency and dates to be determined by said councils. 
                   Section 3:  
    The privelege of decision-making at any meeting shall be limited to
    those present who are actual active members both of the Church and of
    the particular Council or Ring convening the meeting.  If the number
    present is thirteen or less than thirteen, all decisions must be made by
    consensus, and if consensus cannot be reached, by a twothirds majority.
    If the number present is greater than thirteen, all decisions must be by
    a two-thirds majority vote. In meetings where more than thirteen voting
    members are present, the number of votes carried by each member shall be
    equal to the ring (1,2, or 3) that member has attained. Section 4: A
    quorum to conduct business shall consist of a number of voting members
    equal to two-thirds majority plus one of the members of that particular
    council.

    January l to December 31, inclusive.  

         ARTICLE XIII Subsidiary Operations  
                   Section 1: 
    The Corporation, acting through the Board of Directors or their
    delegated authority, may organize, charter, establish, and operate such
    subsidiary operations, agencies, groups, and institutions as may be
    found necessary or expedient adequately to carry out the purposes of the
    Corporation. 
                   Section 2: 
    Each subsidiary shall send a representative to serve on the Board of
    Directors. The subsidiary representatives shall be responsible for
    reporting the activities of the Subsidiary to the Board, and for
    relaying information from the Board to each subsidiary. In addition, the
    subsidiary representatives shall submit reports to the Secretary and the
    Treasurer detailing the activities of each subsidiary.
                  Section 3: 
    Chartering and serving as Directors of subsidiary organizations is open
    only to active members of the Church with Scion or Clergy status.  Under
    exceptional circumstances, and by special dispensation of the Board of
    Directors, a project or provisional subsidiary may be approved for
    inception by a Church member of only 3rd Circle status, conditional upon
    that person's attainment of 4th Circle within a year from the date of
    approval, or the appointment within that time as a Director of the
    aforesaid subsidiary of another active Churcdh member of at least 4th
    Circle. Subsidiaries should begin as projects or provisional sub-
    sidiaries and be considered for full subsidiary status if they have been
    active for two years and two days. Provisional subsidiaries should send
    a contact person to the Board of Directors' meetings. 
                   Section 4:  
    The governance of subsidiaries shall be by Directors and Councils, the
    combined total number of which must always be an odd number, from one to
    seven, of whom one to three shall be designated Directors.  Should the
    subsidiary be authorized to open a bank or checking account, there shall
    be three approved signatories on the account, at least one of which must
    be a Scion or Clergy.  Directors of subsidiaries must be Scions or 
    2510

    Clergy, but other members of the subsidiary councils may be any active
    members of the Church that the subsidiary Directors wish to delegate. 
                   Section 5:  
    Decision-making in subsidiary councils should follow the procedures
    outlined in Article XI, Section 3 above. 

         ARTICLE IV Amendments  
                   Section 1: 
    Amendments or changes in these Bylaws may be made by recommendation of
    the Board of Directors at the Annual meeting, by unanimous vote or
    consensus of voting members present.
