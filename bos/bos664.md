                                Handfast Ritual 

    This is adapted from "Magical Rites from the Crystal Well" by Ed Fitch
    and is a combination of their handfast ritual and american indian
    ceremonial prelude. I'll skip over the consecration as it is a standard
    one and get straight to the ritual itself.  We had a Priestess only, so
    this was written with that in mind but could easily be adapted for a
    Priest and Priestess.

    At this time and in this place
    Do we call upon the Spirits of the Land
    As well as the Mighty Ones of the Skies.
    We call upon the Gods of our own distant past
    From lands far away.
    We call upon the Gods of our spiritual brethren
    Who once called this place
    Their own.
    Witness and rejoyce with us in this moment
    As love is affirmed.

    __Groom's name__ and __Bride's name__ step forward
    Stand before the Gods and those who witness on Earth

    __Groom's name__, if it is your wish to become one with this woman
    Will you pledge your love through all that may come
    As long as love shall last?

    <Groom replies: I so pledge>

    __Bride's name__, if it is your wish to become one with this man
    Will you pledge your love through all that may come As long as love
    shall last?


    <Bride replies: I so pledge>

    Does any say nay?

    As the Gods and the Old Ones are witness
    With those of us present now,
    I now proclaim you man and wife1
    Thus are thy hands fasted...
    The Two are now One,
    This work is done
    And joy is yet begun!


    There is also a portion for the rings using a wand that was left out of
    ours but is normally placed immediately after the vows and is as
    follows...

    The rings are placed upon the wand before the ritual and the wand upon
    the altar.  (This is written for bot Priest and Priestess present)

         The priest picks up the wand and holds one end before him in his
    right hand, the priestess likewise holds the other end in her left hand.

    Place your right hands

    Over this wand...
    And your rings...
    His hand over hers.

    Above you are the stars
    Below you are the stones
    As time passes, remember...
    e a star should your love burn brightly,
    Like the earth should your love be firm.
    Be free in giving of affection and of warmth.
    Have no fear, and let not the ways or words
    Of the unenlightened give you unease.
    For the Gods are with you,
    Now and always!

    The rings are exchanged during the vows.
