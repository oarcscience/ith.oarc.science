                         Modern Wiccan Concepts based in Literary Satanism 

              By: Diane Vera

              As I pointed out to Warren Grant in the PAGAN echo recently, Charles
              G. Leland mentions Michelet in the Appendix to _Aradia:_
              _Gospel_of_the_Witches_: "Now be it observed, that every leading
              point which forms the plot or centre of this _Vangel_  [...]  had
              been told or written out for me in fragments by Maddalena (not to
              mention other authorities), even as it had been chronicled by Horst
              or Michelet" (pp.101-102, 1974 Weiser paperback edition).
               .
              In _A_History_of_Witchcraft_, Jeffrey B. Russell writes:
              "Michelet's argument that witchcraft was a form of social protest
              was adapted later by Marxists; his argument that it was based on a
              fertility cult was adopted by anthropologists at the turn of the
              century, influenig Sir James Frazer's _Golden_Bough_, Jessie
              Weston's _From_Ritual_to_Romance_, Magaret Murray's _Witch-
              Cult_in_Western_Europe_, and indirectly T.S. Eliot's
              _The_Waste_Land_" (_A_History_of_Witchcraft_, p.133).
               .
              Russell states further: "Neopagan witchcraft has roots in the
              tradition of Michelet, who argued that European witchcraft was the
              survival of an ancient religion.  This idea influenced Sir James
              Frazer and a number of other anthropologists and writers in the late
              nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The publication of
              Charles Leland's _Aradia_ in 1899 was an important step in the
              evolution of the new religion of witchcraft.   [...]   The doctrines
              and practices of the witches as reported by Leland are a melange of
              sorcery, medieval heresy, witch-craze concepts, and political
              radicalism, and Leland reports ingenuously that this is just what he
              expected, since it fitted with what he had read in Michelet"
              (Russell, p.148).
               .
              As far as I know, it's possible that Michelet's influence on Gardner
              was only indirect, via the other above-named writers.  This would
              not invalidate my point, which is that Michelet played a key role in
              the development of the ideas in question.
               .
              Michelet has had a more direct influence on feminist Goddess
              religion than on Wicca proper.  Michelet's _La_Sorciere_
              (_Satanism_and_Witchcraft_) is listed in the bibliography of
              _Woman,_Church,_and_State_ by Matilda Gage (19th-century Women's
              Suffrage leader and the founder of pre-Wiccan feminist Goddess
              religion) and, more recently, in _Witches,_Midwives,_and_Nurses:_
              _A_History_of_Women_Healers_ by Barbara Ehrenreich and Dierdre
              English (1973).
               .
              In my opinion, Michelet's most important contribution to both Wicca
              and feminist Goddess religion was that, as far as I know, he was the
              first well-known writer (in recent centuries, anyway) to use the
              word "Witch" (capital W) with its present-day positive connotations
              of healing and opposition to tyranny.


                                                                                1536
