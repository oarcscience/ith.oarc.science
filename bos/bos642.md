                    Study of the Planetary Hours System
                    -----------------------------------
                              by Andrew Kettle.
                                    1994

    Introduction.    Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so
                  one of the questions that echos across the valleys
                  of the traditions is; "Are there to many cooks spoiling
                  the broth?" As most witches are fervent independants, and
                  self-assertively so, each will have a differnt approach
                  and opinion to such a simple observation.
                     Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are
                  truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or
                  distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed
                  unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information
                  scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives
                  and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of
                  the many esoteric book shops.
                     Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of
                  existing wisdom, at times similiar to looking through
                  water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and
                  contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism,
                  however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we
                  stand?

    Sample Text:
                from "What witches do", Stewart Farrar,1989, Phoenix
                                                           Pub.,Wash. p.174.

             Appendix 3. Planetary Hours.

             These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells
             which  have planetary  correspondences. Each  day has  a ruling
             planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after
             the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are:
             Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw);
             Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday,
             Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise
             is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is
             ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus,
             Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation.
             Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesda's
             second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with
             the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's
             first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list  
           is as follows: "


    Disclaimer: I have it as a strong intention, to point out that this
               acticle is not to be taken as a personal attack of the above
               author or the publisher, or any other connecting party.
                I have used Stewart Farrar's text only as a example of the
               commonly published, and accepted, planetary hour concept.

              10.23pm       Saturn       Rise.           Saturn

    Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that the 'Planetary Hours' concept
             is a timetable, based primarily on simplicity, that
             was developed in a age when astronomic technology
             was largely unavailable, so resulting in such a
             system; that in our modern technological society, as
             a result of astronomic calculations being easily
             accessable, that a new system of 'Planetary hours'
             should be constructed upon 'Hours of Right Ascension/
             Planets on the Meridian' where applicable or the highest point
             of ascension, when the planet is not true to the horizon.

    Conflict:   As it can be deduced from the above table, certain
             planetary hours occur when the planet in question is not
             within the horizon. For example, the sun's planetary hours of
             3am and 6pm are outside of 'daytime'; Mar's 2am is outside of
             'Marstime'; the moon's 8am is external to 'Moontime'.
                As a principle, I would remark that it would be of
             assistance in rituals that the planet is in appearance and
             that the optimum time would be when the planet is directly
             above, the hour of Right Ascension/ Planet on the Meridan,
             or highest point of path through the hemispheres. If the
             'worshipper' was to have a difficulty with the domineering
             effect of the planet being above them / on top of them, then a
             principle of welcoming the planet at rise and farewelling the
             planet at set are equally as valid.
                Continuing, this would establish only one planetary hour in
             each day, raising the question of practicality, though a rather
    3103

             erroneous matter, giving the examples hours of:
                     Mars (9.04am) 9am planetary hour,
                     Sun     (11.49am) 11am planetary hour,
                     Mercury (12.13pm) 12pm planetary hour,
                     Venus (2.26pm) 2pm planetary hour, etc.
                To this end, computer programs and/or annual publications
              would easily create the availablity of the timetable, a future
              project for any publishing house or any number of the pagan/
              witchcraft magazine to have as a regular cloumn, thus giving
              the practitioner the simplicity, not resorting to ill-advised
              system as an alternative.
                However, at this point it should be mentioned that, in
              accordance with general perception, the physical planet
              plays a symbolic role, that the planet is not the vehicle of
              magical properties, but a icon, much as the moon is not Aradia
              in person, but a mirror of her essence.
                Furthermore, it is an accepted belief that the full-moon is
              the time of 'Esbat', though in comparison the remaining
              planets are given an inaccurate timetable; a perplexing
              situation.
                Toward, the modernising approach in witchcraft it should be
              important to establish 'correct' instruction to ritual, upon
              the understanding that it would be a great disservice to
              entertain anything else but actuality; as the turmoil of the
              word 'wicca' has caused in the movement, now accepted by most
              as a redefined word, though all the same established upon
              false impressions, an unfortunate situation historically
              speaking.
                An accurate approach to the craft, that is slowly being
              supported as our cultures' resources and developing knowledge
              widely spreading with discussions and publications, will
              result in a detailed sweep and clean of the old
              misconceptions in the traditions and a polish to reflect the
              light of modern education.

    Conclusion: As with the modern approach of Planetary Hours, it should
             be every members directions in tune with open-minded, clear
             thinking not to accept a practice that is incorrect and to
             strive establishing a strengthed tradition on the foundations
             of accurate discovery of the originals of comprehension.
                Such an approach would wash out the '14th century mass
             illiterate' influence that customs have continued. Though
             it must be seen that without this assistance there would
             possible be no present existance of witchcraft, but a
             rectification of this knowledge is by no means an attack.
                Furthermore, it is suggested that a choice should always be
             based on truth and not mislead by mistaken presuption.
