      As Heaven and Nature sing, etc.       
                                            
                    *                       
                    *                       
                                            
         CHRISTMAS TIME IS PAGAN!           
        (Gloria in Excelsius Deo)           
                                            
      CHORUS:                               
           Glorious!                        
           Christmas time is pagan!         
           Glorious!                        
           Christmas time is pagan!         
                                            
      Christmas time is here again,         
      Decorations everywhere.               
      Christmas carols ringing out,         
      Gentle pagans, we don't care.         
                                            
      Modern folks all celebrate            
      What they learned in Sunday School.   
      In December, they don't know          
      They are celebrating Yule!            
                                            
      Let them have their Christmas trees,  
      Decked in red and green and blue.     
      We rejoice at every one!              
      Christmas trees are pagan, too.       
                                            
      Bowls of bubbly Christmas cheer,      
      Fill your cup and quench your thirst. 
      They think the tradition's theirs.    
      Wassail bowls were pagan, first.      



         CHRISTMAS TIME IS PAGAN!                                                   

      Every door and window bears           
      Wreaths of holly, wreaths of pine.    
      Circles represent the Sun.            
      Every wreath is yours and mine.       
                                            
      Christmas lights on Christmas trees,  
      Candle flames burn higher and higher, 
      Let us cheer along, my friends,       
      As they light their Yuletide fire.    
                                            
      There's a possibility                 
      That this song is yours and mine      
      'Cause the tune was known to all      
      Back in A.D. one-two-nine.            
                                            
                    *                       
                    *                       
                                            
           GOD REST YE MERRY, PAGANFOLK     
           (God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen)   
                                            
      God rest ye merry, paganfolk,         
      Let nothing you dismay.               
      Remember that the Sun returns         
      Upon this Solstice day.               
      The growing dark is ending now        
      And Spring is on its way.             
      Oh, tidings of comfort and joy,       
      Comfort and joy!                      
      Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.       
                                            
      The Goddess rest ye merry, too,       
      And keep you safe from harm.          
      Remember that we live within          
      The circle of Her arms,               
      And may Her love give years to come   
      A very special charm.                 
      Oh, tidings of comfort and joy,       
      Comfort and joy!                      
      Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!       
                                            
                            *               
                                            


                                                                                2294
