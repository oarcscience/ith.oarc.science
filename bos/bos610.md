                           The Threefold Goddess 
     
                                      I 
     
         To understand the concept of Goddess requires more than the 
    ability to visualize God as a woman.  The Goddess concept is built 
    around the myth and mystery of the relationship between God and 
    Goddess, and beneath that, and part of it, Her Threefold Aspect ... 
    Maiden, Mother and Crone. 
     
         One of the oldest recognized Goddess forms is the first Greek 
    Goddess - Gaia, the Earth Mother; the Universal Womb; Mother of All. 
    The most ancient Goddesses were most often Earth and Mother Goddesses. 
    The were worshipped and revered as bearers of life ... fat, healthy, 
    pregnant and fruitful. As the Goddess concept developed, then came the 
    Harvest Goddesses, who were also Earth Goddesses.  Understand that 
    this was a time when people did not even understand the basic 
    mechanics of procreation.  Life was very sacred and mystical indeed! 
     
         Gradually, myth and mystery developed and revealed themselves, 
    creating the legend which we honor in the modern Wiccan Craft. 
     
         We recognize the Goddess as the mother of all, including her 
    Mighty Consort, the God.  To Her he is Lover and Son, and together 
    they form the Ultimate, the Omniverse, the Dragon, the Mystery. 
     
         Now that is a pretty tough concept all things considered. 
    Especially in our society as it sounds rather incestuous.  From a 
    mundane perspective, it gets worse as the Wheel of the Year Turns, and
    the Oak and Holly Kings battle ... eternal rivals and 
    sacrificial mates. 
     
         In the pages that follow, we will explore the Goddess foundation
    concepts and try to reach an understanding of the basis of the 
    Mystery. 
     
         I don't want to get off into all the names of all the Goddesses 
    in all the mythology in all of history.  While that is certainly a 
    noble endeavor, it is not the objective here.  What I do want to do is
    look at the Goddess, in whole and in part, and see just who and what 
    she is. 
     
         First and foremost, the Goddess is the symbol of the Cycle of 
    Everlasting.  She is constant, ever present, ever changing, and yet 
    always the same.  She could be compared in that respect to the oceans. 
     
         As a part of that, she is that from which we have come, and to 
    which we will return.  She is the Universal Mother, the Cosmic Womb. 
    While those are largely symbolic images, as opposed to literal ones, 
    they are important to bear in mind about any aspect of the Goddess. 
    She never harms, she is Mother. 
     
         One of the most difficult throwback mentalities to dispell in a 
    student is the difference between "dark and light" and "bad and good".
    Societally, and often religiously, we are trained to see bad and dark
    and evil as being the same.  Hence, we are also taught to hate and 
    fear our own mortality.  All too often I see practicing Wiccans, who 
    ought to *know* better, fall back on these concepts when trying to 
    2677

    explain or understand a concept. 
     
         The Goddess is dark, she is light, she is birth, she is death, 
    and she rejoices in all things.  With death comes joy, for with death
    comes renewal.  With life comes joy, for with life comes promise. 
    With growth comes joy for with growth comes wisdom.  Sorrow and fear 
    are not a part of her, not the way we feel those emotions.  She is 
    incapable of sorrow without joy, she fears nothing, because fear is 
    not real.  It is a creation of the mind. 
     
         Whether you see the Goddess as a Warrior Queen, or like the Good
    Witch of the North in the Wizard of Oz, she is the Goddess.  And she 
    has many parts and facets which defy comprehension as "One".  She 
    simply IS, and in that, can be whatever you need her to be in order to
    establish a relationship with her.  But none of that changes what she
    IS. 
     
         "I greet thee in the many names of the Threefold Goddess and her
    Mighty Consort.  Athe, malkuth, ve-guburah, ve-gedulah, le-olam, Amen.
    Blessed Be." 
     
          So here, at the Circle Door, greeted by the High Priest or 
    Priestess we first see mentioned the Threefold Goddess.  Full-sized 
    covens have three priestesses who take the specific roles of Maiden, 
    Mother and Crone, the High Priestess being Mother. 
     
          The Threefold Goddess however is NOT three entities, she is one.
    Her aspects represent Enchantment, Ripeness and Wisdom. 
     
          Taking first things first is usually best, so we shall start 
    with a look at one side of the Maiden. 
     
          Quoting "The Myth of the Goddess" as found in Gardenarian Wicca
    (Gerald B. Gardner, The Meaning of Witchcraft, Aquarian Press, London,
    1959.): 
     
          Now Aradia had never loved, but she would solve all the 
    Mysteries, even the Mystery of Death; and so she journeyed to the 
    Nether Lands. 
     
          The Guardians of the Portals challenged her, "Strip off thy 
    garments, lay aside thy jewels; for naught may ye bring with ye into 
    this our land." 
     
          So she laid down her garments and her jewels and was bound, as 
    were all who enter the Realms of Death the Mighty One.  Such was her 
    beauty that Death himself knelt and kissed her feet, saying, "Blessed by
    thy feet that have brought thee in these ways.  Abide with me, let me
    place my cold hand on thy heart."  She replied "I love thee not. 
    Why dost thou cause all things that I love and take delight in to fade
    and die?" 
     
          "Lady," replied Death, "it is Age and Fate, against which I am 
    helpless.  Age causes all things to wither, but when men die at the 
    end of time I give them rest and peace, and strength so that they may
    return.  But thou, thou art lovely.  Return not; abide with me." 
     
          But she answered, "I love thee not." 
    2678
     
          Then said Death, "An' thou receive not my hand on thy heart 
    thou must receive Death's scourge." 
     
          "It is Fate; better so", she said, and she knelt, and Death 
    scourged her and she cried "I feel the pangs of love." 
     
          And Death said, "Blessed be" and gave her the Fivefold Kiss, 
    saying "Thus only may ye attain joy and knowledge." 
     
          And he taught her all the Mysteries.  And they loved and were 
    one, and he taught her all the Magicks. 
     
          For there are three great events in the life of Man:  Love, 
    Death and Resurrection in a new body, and Magick controls them all. 
    For to fulfill love you must return again at the same time and place 
    as the loved one, and you must remember and love them again.  But to 
    be reborn you must die, and be ready for a new body; and to die you 
    must be born; and without love you may not be born.  And these be all
    the Magicks. 
     
         So there in the Gardnerian Myth of the Goddess we have her 
    Maiden aspect, seeking, searching and opening herself to the 
    mysteries.  But it is well to remember that the Goddess herself is a 
    mystery, and the primary gift of the Goddess is intuitive Wisdom. 
     
         Beltaine (Bealtain) is the only Sabbat where the Goddess is 
    entirely devoted to the Maiden.  Here, she revels in the enchantment, 
    in the joy of coming into fullness and mating with the God.  Here, she
    is maiden bride and we can most easily understand that facet of the 
    Maiden aspect.  I should probably note here that some see this 
    festival as maiden turning into mother, with the maiden being in full at
    Candlemas, but I do not agree with that. 
     
         Youth, newness, innocence and beauty are fundamental facets of 
    the Maiden aspect.  But beneath those are seeking, and love, and love of
    seeking.  There is more to understand of the Maiden though. 
    Enchantment does not end with maidenhood, it is simply the beginning 
    of the Mystery of Life, for that, above all, is what the Goddess 
    stands for. 
     
         In Circle, in the Balanced Universe, the Maiden takes her place 
    in the East.  In examining this most comfortable quarter, you learn 
    more about the Maiden Aspect.  East (Air) rules the free mind and 
    intellect.  It is the place to seek the ability to learn and to open 
    spiritually, to open your mind and find answers.  It is a masculine 
    quarter, ruled by intellect, and analytical logic, but she brings to 
    it an intuition which is required to use these to best advantage. 
     
         "The river is flowing, flowing and growing, the river is flowing
    back to the sea.  Mother carry me, a child I will always be.  Mother 
    carry me, back to the sea." 
     
         This Circle chant, sung in joy, sung in sorrow, is a cry to the 
    Mother Aspect for comfort and warmth, a power chant calling upon the 
    steady power and fullness of the Mother and a plea for guidance. 
    While the Earth Mother, and the fully aspected Goddess are placed 
    North in the Earth quarter, the Mother aspect alone belongs in the 
    west. 
    2679
     
         Comfort and love rule here.  Emotions, sorrow, joy, tears, these
    belong to the ripeness of the Mother.  Caring and loving for all her 
    children, watching in pain and pride as they struggle to gain their 
    own, knowing full well she could reach out and do it for them, but 
    being both bound and desirous to let them do it for themselves. 
     
         There is a considerable difference, as you might have interpreted
    from the above, between the Earth Mother and the Mother Aspect of the
    Goddess.  That is why we've started with her quarter, because it 
    reveals the limitations of the Aspect. 
     
         The Mother aspect is ripeness, the ancient bearing of fruit, 
    child and grain.  She represents emotion and sexuality.  The Goddess 
    in that aspect is most of the altar (as discussed in the Great Rite 
    lesson.)  It is interesting to note the practice in numerous ancient 
    cultures of lovemaking or outright sex magick in cornfields to help 
    make the corn grow. 
     
         The Dark Mother should also be placed here, although culturally, I
    have a tendancy to think of the Dark Mother as more in keeping the 
    Crone Aspect.  It is a bit of work to see the Dark Mother in the West,
    to separate Dark Mother from Crone, but it is worthwile.  If you have
    any background with the tarot I would suggest you take it in that 
    context, it is beyond the scope of this text. 
     
        Our exploration of the Goddess and her Aspects brings us now to 
    the Crone.  For me, the Crone is the most fascinating of the Aspects 
    of the Goddess.  Partly I suppose because she is the most mysterious 
    and paradoxical. 
     
        "Blessed Goddess, old and wise, open mine, thy child's, eyes. 
    Speak to me in whispered tones that I may know the rune of Crones." 
     
        With life and growth comes age and wisdom, and the Crone is this 
    in part.  She holds fire and power, which wisely used can be of great
    benefit, but hold great danger for the unaware.  Hers are the secrets of
    death and of life, and the mystery beyond the mystery. 
     
        Part of the pleasure in knowing the Crone aspect is that while, 
    unlike the fully aspected Goddess, she is not also Maiden and Mother,
    she does retain the experiences of both those Aspects in order to be 
    Crone.  The Crone, wizened though she is, must still be able to reach
    into herself and recall the innocent joys and high passions of the 
    Maiden and the love and warmth of the Mother.  To be Crone and to not 
    have forgotten, to still be able to experience Maiden and Mother is, 
    to me, very appealing.  More importantly, to be comfortable in that 
    Aspect, where you have truth and knowledge but have left youth and 
    physical beauty behind, and to still _feel_ youth and beauty without 
    being desirous of them is an admirable quality. 
     
        Crone is the least paralleled Aspect of the Goddess to our human 
    society.  We discard our old and wise, not understanding their value 
    as teachers and models, and fearing their appearance as a reminder of
    our own mortality. 
     
        Knowing Crone is a door we much each open for ourselves for to know
    and love her is to cast aside a great many of our cultural and societal
    malteachings. 
    2680
     
         While the individual Aspects of Threefold Goddess are certainly 
    valid concepts and paths to knowing Goddess, I should caution that most
    mythological Goddess figures are composite Goddesses.  Earth Mother 
    Goddess figures are fully aspected Goddess by definition because they
    represent the full cycle of the Wheel.  Most other Goddess figures can
    be classified as having a dominant (or operative) aspect and recessive
    (promised, or in some cases past) aspect.  Future and past should not be
    taken literally, mythological Goddess figures are always whatever they
    are eternally, they do not tend to change (ie age). 
     
         Maiden Goddesses possessing their operative in the Huntress or 
    Warrior aspects most often have a promise of Crone. Maiden Goddesses 
    expressing their dominance in beauty and/or love usually have their 
    recessive aspect as Mother.  For example, Athena is a Maiden Goddess 
    with Crone attributes (the combination produces many Mother-type 
    qualities, and this results in the Crone aspected Maiden being the 
    most complete of the Mythological Goddesses, with the exception of 
    Earth Mother Goddesses.) Aphrodite is of course a Maiden Goddess with
    Mother attributes. 
     
         Similarly, Dark Mother Goddess figures mostly find their promise in
    Crone and Light Mother figures their recessive in Maiden.   Crone 
    recessives work the same way, although sometimes it takes a bit of 
    close examination to find the "hidden" aspect. 
     
         One should note that this is not a formula, rather a tool to 
    assist in examining and understanding Goddess figures and creating 
    one's own personal spiritual link with Goddess.  It is also a useful 
    consideration when invoking a specific Goddess with purpose in ritual. 
         The purpose of this course has been to open avenues of approach 
    in discovering and developing a relationship with Goddess.  For me 
    personally, I do not "believe" in the reality of mythological Goddess
    figures as they were presented, but I do believe they are a valid way to
    establish communication with Goddess.  I also believe Goddess will
    appear in whatever form we are most ready to accept.  The real 
    Goddess, by my belief (and this is personal, not trad) is an entity 
    beyond my comprehension, perhaps composed of light (could 5000 sci-fi
    films be wrong?), most assuredly unlike anything I could ever imagine in
    true form.  However, I do find mythological Goddess figures highly
    useful for ritual, and of some help in my personal relationship with 
    Goddess. I hope you will too. 
     
    Blessed Be
