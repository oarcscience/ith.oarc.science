                                           PAN TO ARTEMIS 
                Uncharmable charmer 
                Of Bacchus and Mars, 
                In the sounding, rebounding 
                Abyss of the stars! 
                O virgin in armour, 
                Thine arrows unsling 
                In the brilliant resilient 
                First rays of the spring! 
                 
                By the force of the fashion 
                Of love, when I broke 
                Through the shroud, through the cloud, 
                Through the storm, through the smoke, 
                To the mountain of passion 
                Volcanic that woke-- 
                By the rrage of the mage 
                I invoke, I invoke! 
                 
                By the midnight of madness, 
                The lone-lying sea, 
                The swoon of the moon, 
                Your swoon into me; 
                The sentinel sadness 
                Of cliff-clinging pine, 
                That night of delight 
                You were mine, you were mine! 
                 
                You were mine, O my saint, 
                My maiden, my mate, 
                By the might of the right 
                Of the night of our fate. 
                Though I fall, though I faint, 
                Though I char, though I choke, 
                By the hour of our power 
                I invoke, I invoke! 
                By the mystical union 
                Of fairy and faun, 
                Unspoken, unbroken-- 
                The dusk to the dawn!-- 
                A secret communion, 
                Unmeasured, unsung, 
                The listless, resistless, 
                Tumultuous tongue!-- 
                 
                O virgin in armour 
                Thine arrows unsling, 
                In the brilliant resilient 
                First rays of the spring! 
                No Godhead could charm her, 
                But manhood awoke-- 
                O fiery Valkyrie, 
                I invoke, I invoke! 


                                                                                               1848
