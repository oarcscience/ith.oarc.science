                            Descent Into Confusion 
                               by Robert Hughes

    One of the celebrated "mysteries" of revivalist Wicca is the
    'ritual play' known as the Legend of the Descent of the
    Goddess. In my Gardnerian Book of Shadows, dating from the
    sixties, the Legend is to be enacted separately at "a meeting
    for preparation for Third Degree". Only third degree witches
    may attend this meeting with the initiate who is to take
    second degree.

    The Legend is enacted in front of the initiate by four of the
    third degree witches. Two take the role of Narrator and
    Guardian of the Portal (of the underworld), while the High
    Priest and High Priestess or Maiden take the roles of God and
    Goddess. The term Guardian of the Portal may have been
    borrowed from the rituals of the Golden Dawn.

    In this enactment, the ruler of the underworld and Lord of
    Death is the Horned One. The Legend begins with the statement:
    '...Our Lady, the Goddess, would solve all mysteries - even
    the mystery of death. And so she journeyed to the Netherworld
    where the Guardian of the Portal challenged her.' The Guardian
    orders her to strip off her garments and jewels and she is
    bound with cords and brought into the presence of the Lord of
    Death.

    The God is so overcome by her beauty that he falls and kisses
    her feet and begs her to stay with him in the underworld. The
    Goddess replies that she does not love him, and she asks why
    he causes all the things she loves and delights in to fade and
    die.

    The God replies that the cause is 'age and fate' and he says
    he is helpless to stop it, although he can give the dead 'rest
    and peace and strength, so that they may return.' A second
    time he asks the Goddess to stay with him. When she again says
    she does not love him, Death replies she must suffer a
    scourging at his hands.

    Following this scourging, and the five fold kiss, the Goddess
    says: 'I know the pain of love'. It is then that the God
    'taught her all the mysteries'. He also gives her a special
    necklace which is 'a symbol of the Circle of Rebirth'. In
    return, our Lady teaches him the 'sacred mystery of the
    cauldron'. The Legend ends with an affirmation of the reality
    of reincarnation among the Hidden Children of the Goddess and
    'the mystery of magick which is placed between the worlds'.
    The initiate is then invited to ask questions about the
    meaning of the Legend.

    Even anyone with only a slight knowledge of understanding of
    mythology will recognise the contradictions and confusions
    which exist within the structure and symbolism of the Legend.
    The first point of controversy is when, where, and by whom,
    this ritual originated. Some (unconfirmed) sources claim it is
    of 19th century origin. It is said to be a product of the
    famous "Cambridge" coven of academics who revived the
    2738

    classical Mysteries in the early 1800s. More reliable evidence
    exists to prove that Gerald Gardner sent a draft of the Legend
    to Aleister Crowley for correction in the 1940s.

    Kelly (Crafting the Art of Magic, Llewellyn, 1991) claims that
    the Legend does not appear in the pre-1949 second degree
    initiation in the famous (infamous?) Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical
    and says: "The content of this document probably dates to 1953
    or earlier..." (p.128). Gardner quotes from the Legend in his
    book, Witchcraft Today as if he had received it from the New
    Forest coven. In fact he describes it as 'the central part of
    one of their rituals. It is a sort of primitive
    spiritualism.'. He goes on to compare its importance in the
    Craft to the Christian myth of the crucifixion and
    resurrection. (1970, pp 44-46). Gardner goes on to say the
    Legend 'upon which its members base their action is the
    central idea of the cult.' He compares it with the story of
    Istar (sic) descending into hell and the myth of the Hindu god
    Siva (Shiva) as Lord of Death and destruction. Gardner then
    says he believes the Legend may be of Celtic  origin. To
    support this fanciful statement, he says that: 'In Celtic
    legends the Lords of the Underworld did prepare you for death
    and many living people are said to have entered their regions,
    formed alliances with them, and returned safely, but it needed
    great courage; only a hero or a demi-god dared to risk it.'
    (p.46). One presumes that here Gardner is making an allusion
    to the realm of Faerie and the widespread folk belief that
    faeries were the spirits of the dead.

    This is classic Gardner at his most confusing and, perhaps,
    deliberately misleading and mischievous. The version of the
    Legend as presented by Gardner is both patriarchal and
    mythologically inaccurate. It seems to be based on a hybrid
    combination of the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, and
    the Middle Eastern myth of Inanna-Ishtar. Gardner does not
    mention the Demeter-Persephone myth in his speculations,
    instead sidetracking the reader into the realms of Celtic
    myth, although he does devote a chapter of his book to the
    Greek Mysteries - basically as a means of justifying the
    practice of scourging.

    In the Middle Eastern myth, Inanna is the Goddess of the Moon
    and Venus. She was probably, 'one of the three great goddesses
    of the Bronze Age' (Baring & Cashford, 1991). Inanna was known
    by the title Queen of Heaven and Earth and her myth is an
    archetypal form of the eternal story of the mourning
    widow/mother goddess and the saviour god, who is her
    son/lover, dies, descends to the underworld and is reborn.
    This myth is found in most Mediterranean cultures and in
    northern Europe, and it formed the 'pagan' basis for the new
    religion of Christianity.

    The Demeter-Persephone myth is a post-patriarchal variant on
    this ancient legend with the daughter (Persephone) being
    kidnapped and held prisoner by Pluto, the Lord of Death and
    the ruler of Hades. In recent years some feminist
    mythographers have re-written this classic story and produced
    alternative versions without any patriarchal overtones (see
    2739

    Spretnak, 1978).

    Gardner was correct to refer to visits to the underworld by
    heroes and demi-gods (sic). However, in the majority of the
    extant legends and myths, such as the descent of Arthur to
    Annwn to capture the Cauldron of the Goddess, and Baldur's
    ritual death and descent into the realm of Hel, it is a male
    mortal or god who is involved in the descent and is "reborn".
    It is the Goddess, in her 'dark aspect, who rules over the
    realm of the dead, controls the power of fate and grants the
    hero/god the supreme initiation of transformation and rebirth.
    In the Gardnerian Legend of the Descent we are led to believe
    that the Goddess, who is represented in The Charge as an
    all-powerful deity offering her worshippers 'upon death, peace
    unutterable, rest and the ecstasy of the Goddess', and is
    described by Gardner himself as 'the Great Mother, the giver
    of life' (1970, p.45), visits the underworld knowing nothing
    about the mysteries of life and death. She allegedly knows
    nothing about the natural process that makes 'all the things
    that I love, and take delight in, fade and die' until she is
    taught these mysteries by the God. In fact in response to her
    question the God replies 'tis age and fate'. Significantly
    these are both concepts associated with the Dark Goddess of
    the Underworld, who has no role in Gardner's version of the
    Craft.

    It is not difficult to see the Legend of the Descent of the
    Goddess in terms of 'a theologising of the scourging' (Kelly,
    1991), which was such an important aspect of the rituals in
    Gardner's time. Taking this argument a step forward, as Kelly
    does (1991, pp 28-29), it could appear that the content of the
    Legend was based on Gardner's sexual fantasies and his
    personal concept of the Goddess. He imagined the Goddess as 'a
    sweet, lovely woman', while in the more traditional branches
    of the Craft she is a darker deity ruling fate, death and the
    underworld as well as sexuality. This alternative archetypal
    image of the witch goddess has largely been ignored by
    revivalist Wicca. It will continue to do so while Gardner's
    confused and mythologically incorrect Legend of the Descent of
    the Goddess remains the 'central idea' of the modern Craft.
