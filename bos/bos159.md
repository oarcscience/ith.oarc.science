                               HOME BLESSING MAGICK

         A home blessing meditation for charging a room:
         o    Sit Straight with palms on lap, take deep breaths, relax,
              and move into a mental space where you activate your
              intuitive senses, 
         o    Imagine a cord of energy from your spine connecting you to
              the Earth, and channel energy from the Earth through it,
         o    Silently ask for divine protection, guidance, and blessing,
         o    Direct your psychic sensing outward, and feel lines of
              force coming out of your aura, 
         o    Note where the strongest energy is (check out the
              floor,ceiling, directions, etc), Note spots that feel empty
              or dead, note places that feel full alive, focus on where
              you are sitting and how you feel at that particular spot,
         o    Imagine a sphere of light and love energy at your heart,
              feel it pulsing outward with every breath. 
         o    Feel the radiance increase with every breath, feel your self
              as a star, continue to breathe deeply and send out the
              energy, letting it pulsate in the room, 
         o    When ready, start making power sounds representing the love
              and light you are channeling; use it to amplify the light
              you are weaving; and fill the room with the energy, 
         o    Then shift focus to sending a probe out into the room, and
              note the differences in the quality of energy and how you feel
              about it,
         oRepeat if necessary,
         oWhen done, feel the completeness of the work.

         A room blessing involving elemental quarter invocations:
         oFace each direction (with arms out in appropriate elemental
         invoking gesture), and say, while channeling and visualizing
         elemental power:
         -    Powers of (say direction),
         -    Powers of (say corresponding element),
         -    We great you, we honor you, we welcome you here!
         -    Watch over and bless and protect this place.
         oAfter each invocation, shape the energy into columns of light
         by sweeping ones arms together until they are parallel and
         sweeping them up and down while channeling and shaping the
         energy,
         oWhen the energy is properly shaped, say so "mote it be."

         oAfter you have done all four quarters, channel in spirit
         energy.

         To return the energy to a more mellow state while energizing
         yourself, put your hands out and take in a bit of the energy into
         your self from each direction, going widdershins, hold hands to
         your heart and take in the energy (techniques also exist for
         bringing it into a stone and retrieving it when needed).

         The above was taught by Selena Fox at Esotericon V, in January
         1988.

                                                                                 664
