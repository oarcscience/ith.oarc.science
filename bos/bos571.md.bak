                                  "Earthmom" 
         "Well, for instance, who is this All-Mother you're always talking
    about?"

         "Why, you are, Edward. . . The All-Mother.  You're the All-Mother,
    I'm the All-Mother, that little bird singing out there, it's the
    All-Mother.  The All-Mother is everything.  The All-Mother is life..."
         The primal and supreme deity of the ancient world, the oldest and
    most universally worshipped, was the Great Mother, Mother Earth.  Images
    of Her date back to Aurignacian Cro-Magnon peoples, from 27,000 years
    ago, and are found all over the Eurasian continent from Spain to
    Siberia.  For thousands of years before there were any male gods, there
    was The Goddess, and Her worship continued unabated clear up until its
    violent suppression by Iron Age patrism.  When and where worship of the
    Mother prevailed women and Nature were held in esteem.  The Chinese
    called Her Kwan Yin; the Egyptians knew Her as Isis; the Navajo call Her
    Changing Woman.  To the Greeks She was Gaia, and to many black peoples
    She is Yemanja.  She is Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, and She says: 
    "All acts of love and pleasure are my rituals."  She is also the ancient
    Crone Hecate,who gives us both wisdom and death.  The Goddess is
    diversity.  She represents both darkness and Light and Her worship is
    the reconciliation of opposites.  There can be no such thing as a "Good
    Goddess" or an "Evil Goddess".  Death is part of the natural cycle as
    night follows day and we accept it with grace as Her final gift.  The
    search for Balance is the goal of Her people, and it is achieved by the
    acceptance of multiple paths and truths.  Dion Fortune once commented
    that all goddesses are manifestations of the One Great Goddess whose
    identity is as the universal feminine spirit of Nature.

         The eldest and greatest aspect of the Goddess is as Great Mother
    2513

    Nature, the all-encompassing energy of Universal Life.  Her womb is the
    Quasar, the white hole through which all energy pours into creation, and
    Her all-devouring mouth is the Black hole itself through which all
    matter is consumed to be reborn once again as between Her thighs the
    universe is squeezed from spirit.  Her energy then coalesces into
    Matter-Mater:the Mother of all forms. She ignites, becoming the Star
    Goddess Nuit, whose galactic breast is our Milky way.  Of Her are born
    star systems and planets including, of course, our very own Earth
    Mother, Gaia.

         Because of the diversity of the Goddess, She is seen as manifesting
    in many different aspects.  She is often called The Triple Goddess,
    which refers to Her link in the fertility cycle where She appears as
    Maiden, Mother and Crone.  Some ancient cultures personified this
    Triplicity as the waxing, full, and waning Moon, and other three-faced
    Goddess aspects are familiar to us as the Fates, the Graces, the Furies,
    the Muses, or even as Faith, Hope and Charity.  Another familiar
    division of Her aspects is into Mother and Daughter (Demeter and
    Persephone), or as Sisters/Lovers (Fauna and Flora).  Such polarities
    are also important in Her worship.  Sometimes the polarity can exist
    with two different aspects of the Goddess representing both poles, but
    more commonly it is the great gender polarity, for the Goddess is a
    deity of sexual loving.     

         She is Ishtar or Aphrodite, the eternal Lover who awaits with eager
    arms the mortal man brave enough to risk Her immortal favor.  Many men
    have worshipped Her as a lover, but she may never be possessed, for She
    belongs only to Herself.  She is Parthenos, the eternal Virgin (in the
    prepatriarchal meaning "of her own household").  She represents the
    Strong Woman : not dominant, but independent.  Her lovers are not truly
    human but divine.  She has been the Beloved of many gods, and though
    jealous male gods eventually suppressed Her worship, She shared the
    co-rulership of Heaven and Earth for thousands of years of marital
    bliss.  She is the inescapable Yin necessary for the cosmic balance of
    Yang/Yin.  Symbols associated with Her (the Tree of Life, the Sacred
    Serpent, the Labryrinth) are found in all parts of the globe, at the
    heart of all the Mysteries, and underlying all the later accretions of
    successive religions.  The search for Her is the search for our deepest
    ancestral roots.I am the star that rises from the twilight sea.I bring
    men dreams to rule their destiny.I am the eternal Woman; I am She!The
    tides of all souls belong to me-Touch of my hand confers polarity-These
    are the moontides, these belong to me.

                               Honor Thy Mother
         In all the cultures where She is still worshipped, there is no
    confusion over Her identity : She is Nature, and She is the Earth.  She
    is not an atavistic abstraction, not a mystical metaphor, not a
    construct of consciousness.  Her body is of substance as material as our
    own, and we tread upon Her breast and are formed of Her flesh.  "Walk
    lightly on the bosom of the Earth Mother," says Sun Bear, and tradition-
    al Native Americans agree.  Cherokee shaman Rolling Thunder emphasizes
    that "It's very important for people to realize this:  the Earth is a
    living organism, the body of a higher individual who has a will and
    wants to be well, who is at times less healthy or more healthy,
    physically and mentally."3  Frank Waters, author of Masked Gods and Book
    of the Hopi, makes the same point::. . . To Indians the Earth is not
    inanimate.  It is a living entity, the mother of all life, our Mother
    Earth.  All Her children, everything in nature, is alive:  the living
    2514

    stone, the great breathing mountains, trees and plants, as well as birds
    and animals and man.  All are united in one harmonious whole.4        Renowned historian Arnold Toynbee, writing on "The Religious Background
    of the Present Environmental Crisis," also observed that:For pre-monoth-
    eistic man, nature was not just a treasure-trove of "natural resources". 
    Nature was, for him, a goddess, "Mother Earth," and the vegetation that
    sprang from the Earth, the animals that roamed, like man himself, over
    the Earth's surface, and the minerals hiding in the Earth's bowels, all
    partook of Nature's divinity.5     Before ever land was, before ever the
    sea, Or soft hair of the grass, or fair limbs of the tree,  Or flesh-
    coloured fruit of my branches, I was :         And thy soul was in me.

                                The Gaia Thesis
         In order to understand the nature of the Earth Mother, we must
    first understand our own origins.  Biologically, unisexual organisms are
    always considered to be female, since only the female brings forth life
    from her own body; in the act of reproduction single cells are referred
    to as mothers and their offspring as daughters. Each of us began our
    individual life as a single fertilized cell, or zygote.  In the process
    of its innumerable divisions and multiplications, that cell kept
    dividing up and redistributing the very same protoplasm.  That
    protoplasm which now courses through all of the several trillion cells
    of your adult body is the very same substance which once coursed through
    the body of that original zygote.  For when a cell reproduces, the
    mother cell does not remain intact, but actually becomes the two new
    daughter cells.  And this is why, no matter how many times a cell
    fissions in the process of embryological development, all the daughter
    cells collectively continue to comprise but one single organism.      We
    may imagine that, should our cells have consciousness akin to our own,
    they may very well fancy themselves to be independent entities living
    and dying in a world that to them would seem to be merely an inanimate
    environment.  Blood cells race along our arterial highways, but we know
    them to be in fact minute components of the far vaster living beings
    that we ourselves are.   Over three billion years ago, life on Earth
    began, as do we all, with a single living cell containing a replicating
    molecule of DNA.  From that point on, that original cell, the first to
    develop the awesome capacity for reproduction, divided and redivided and
    subdivided its protoplasm into the myriads of plants and animals,
    including ourselves, which now inhabit this third planet from the
    Sun. But no matter how many times a cell fissions in the process of
    embryological development, all the daughter cells collectively continue
    to comprise but one single organism.  All life on Earth comprises the
    body of a single vast living being:Mother Earth Herself.  The Moon is
    Her radiant heart, and in the tides beats the pulse of Her blood.  The
    protoplasm which coursed through the body of that first primeval
    ancestral cell is the very protoplasm which now courses through every
    cell of every living organism, plant or animal, of our planet.  And as
    in our own bodies, Earthly life was biologically female for the first 3
    billion years, before sexual reproduction, complete with males, evolved
    around 600 million years ago.  In evolutionary theory we say "ontogeny
    recapitulates phylogeny" (the development of the individual repeats the
    development of the ancestry);  ancient people anticipated such scien-
    tific ideas when they intuitively conceptualized our planetary Divinity,
    like that first single cell, as feminine:  our Mother Earth.  
      The soul of our planetary biosphere is She whom we call Goddess.
    First life on my sources first drifted and swam.  Out of me are the
    forces which save it or damn.

    2515

    Out of me man and woman, and wild-beast and bird.  Before God was, I
    am.6". . . Be the terror and the dread of all the wild beasts and all
    the birds of heaven, of everything that crawls on the ground and all the
    fish of the sea: they are handed over to you."   (Gen. 9:2-3)          

         Since the time of the Exodus, 3,500 years ago, Western Civilization
    has been pursuing a course that has taken it farther and fhree great
    monotheistic religions of the West, Judaism, Christianity and Islam,
    have from their beginning activity suppressed the worship of the
    Goddess, and have tortured and brutally murdered millions of Her people. 
    Today, she is all but forgotten in the hearts of Her children, and Her
    body lies raped and ravished in the wake of human progress.  The Goddess
    is the concept of feminine divinity incarnate.  The denial of feminine
    divinity results in the oppression of all women, including Mother
    Nature.  As Toybee says:The thesis of the present essay is that some of
    the major maladies of the present-day world:for instance the recklessly
    extravagant consumption of nature's irreplaceable treasures, and the
    pollution of those of them that man has not already devoured:can be
    traced back in the last analysis to a religious cause, and that this
    cause is the rise of monotheism. 5

         This is not to say that all non-monotheistic religions have a
    perfect track record for the treatment of women in those societies. 
    Certainly Hindu cultures revere various goddesses and yet are among the
    more sexist and female-suppressive societies in the modern world. 
    Nevertheless, there is abundant archeological evidence to indicate that
    things were not always as they are now, especially in truly ancient
    societies like India.  Before the Aryan Indo-European invasion around
    1,500 BCE many Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures, including the Harrapan
    culture of the Indus Valley and the Minoan people of Crete, had
    societies that appeared remarkably egalitarian.  These societies were
    universally characterized by the worship of a powerful Great Mother whom
    the Hindu people still call Maha Devi Ma.  She was later broken into a
    multiplicity of minor goddesses which were demoted to the position of
    wives or concubines of the gods.    By the time sacred writings were
    codified in the Vedas, the Primal Goddess Maha Devi in India had been
    divided into a triplicity of goddesses characterized as Creator,
    Preserver and Destroyer:  Saraswati, Laksmi and Kali; respectively the
    consorts of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.  In  Greece, a similar process led
    to Kore, Demeter and Persephone (or Hecate) created from the original
    Cretan Rhea.   Once the Great Mother had been married off She became
    easier to control and the way was paved for  Her dowry of natural wealth
    to be handed over to the financial control of Her divine consorts. 
    Whether this new mythical development was a simple mirror of  the social
    diminishment of women's rights or whether it preceded it and was invoked
    as a justification is really a moot point.  But the land, formerly tied
    to matrilineal territorial clans, passed into the hands of patriarchal
    kings and princes who began to treat it as their private property and to
    lay waste to the forests in order to build vast temples and palaces to
    house their harems and other slaves.  The Goddess of Nature went from
    the position of being  the body and soul of all that lives to that of a
    wife, mother and household servant.  Many traditions have given lip
    service to the so-called "Female Principle," either in the form of a
    divided identity like the Hindu Shakti or as a semi-divine emanation. 
    But the power of the Goddess of Nature has gradually lost its ability to
    inspire the necessary respect and reverence once accorded to the Source
    and Bearer of Life.

    2516

              Where are You, then, Mother, whose strength was before All
    other powers?  Your name is the only freedom.8    Pantheism is the view
    that everything in Nature is alive, and that all living is Divine.  In
    that context, then,  the simplest explanation of Divinity is as "an
    energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us, it
    penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together." (Star Wars:  "The Force") 

    Thus a pantheistic theology of Immanent Divinity ("Thou Art God/dess")
    contrasts sharply with the theology of Transcendent Divinity ("God is
    Out There") presented by most of "The World's Great Religions."  Unlike
    the God worshipped by Christians, Moslems and Jews, the Goddess is not
    an all-powerful, indestructible, non-physical being who created the
    world and exists apart from it.  Though Mother Nature is Life on the
    universal scale,  Gaia, the Earth Mother is the very soul of this living
    planet, and she lives or dies as all life on this planet lives or dies.
    . .  Mother, not maker; born, and not made.  Though her children forsake
    her, allured or afraid,  Praying prayers to the God of their fashion, She stirs not for all who have prayed.O my children, too dutiful
    towards Gods not of me,  Was not I enough beautiful?  Was it hard to be
    free?     For, behold, I am with you, am in you, and of you:  Look forth
    now and see!6  "Earth Mother, Your Children Are Here!" Current environ-
    mental crises are legion.  Chlorofluorocarbon chemicals are destroying
    the ozone layer in the atmosphere; industrial pollution is creating the
    greenhouse effect which will melt the polar icecaps, drowning the
    coastal regions; and  the destruction of the rainforests and the
    pollution of phytoplankton in the seas is causing worldwide droughts. 
    The problems are so vast and the politics of greed and corruption are so
    complex that it will truly take a miracle to reverse such global
    destruction.  The only thing that can save us is a total and electrify-
    ing change of consciousness.  Nothing short of a worldwide realization
    of our planetary awareness will bring home the desperation of our
    plight.  We must activate our Gaian identification so that we regain our
    shattered empathy with the Spirit of Nature.  We must become one with
    the Earth Mother in order to feel Her pain/our pain and make it stop
    before the cancer we have become reaches the terminal phase.

         The word religion derives from the Latin re-ligio; "relinking." 
    The very purpose of true religion, then, is to heal the rifts and
    alienations which have caused us to become separated from the divine
    Source of Being:  the rifts between humanity and Nature; between matter
    and spirit; between mind and body; between man and woman; between our
    own egos and the Soul of Nature.  Recent books analyzing the trends of
    our wayward world have, with increasing frequency, been calling for a
    return to the worship of the Mother.  So many wistful comments made by
    writers such as Merlin Stone, Mary Daly, James Lovelock, Judy Chicago,
    Dolores LaChapelle, Rene Dubos, Daniela Gioseffi, Paolo Soleri,
    Elizabeth Gould Davis, Arnold Toynbee, Joseph Campbell, Marija Gimbutas
    and Riane Eisler reflect a craving for such a religious revival.  The
    truth is that such a revival has been going on for some time now:since
    the early 1960's:in the form of what we call the Neo-Pagan movement
    (from Latin paganus:"peasant" or country dweller:Paganism now refers
    to all nature religions).  To the several hundred thousand Neo-Pagans
    who have been actively practicing and publishing for more than a quarter
    of a century, the greatest mystery of this religion is its continuing
    obscurity and invisibility to those such as the above-named writers, who
    continue to publish books advocating such a movement as this, while
    remaining ignorant that it is already in effect.  The new Paganism
    encompasses many Nature-oriented groups such as Feraferia, Church of All
    2517

    Worlds, Madrakara, Bear Tribe, Venusian Church, Pagan Way, Church of the
    Eternal Source, Odinic Fellowship, Reformed Druids, Earth Church of
    Amargi and Children of the Earth Mother.     The largest contingent of
    modern Goddess-worshippers, however, is found in Witchcraft, or Wicca. 
    Wicca is a pre-Christian European Pagan magical tradition; European
    Shamanism.  The violent suppression to the point of eradication of the
    followers of Wicca by the Inquisition can only be compared to the Jewish
    Holocaust of Nazi Germany (estimates of the number of martyrs run as
    high as nine million!), but today the Craft is making a powerful
    comeback on the wings of the re-emergent Goddess.

         The Neo-Pagan movement, and especially Feminist Witchcraft, has
    recently been joined by increasing numbers from the Women's Spirituality
    movement and lately also by many thinkers from the Deep Ecology movement
    and even such radical environmental activists as Earth First!.  These
    are some of the forces which form the core of the movement to restore
    the Earth Goddess to Her rightful place; a movement which has its roots
    in the combined studies of feminism and ecology and is the logical
    spiritual application of such studies.  If Witches can be priestesses of
    feminism, then Neo-Pagans are the chaplains of the ecology movement. The
    overall movement, though variously called Eco-feminism and Ecosophy, is 
    truly an attempt at expressing Gaian Spirituality.     These three
    streams of spirituality:Deep Ecology, Goddess Spirituality, and
    Neo-Paganism:have met and mingled with Native American, Hindu,
    Tibetan, Hawaiian and other ancient spiritual teachings and fused
    somewhat with the more nebulous New Age Movement.  What is struggling to
    be born from this blending of pathways is a truly planetary religious
    metaphor that will transcend all the tradition-specific patterns in the
    same way the idea of Neo-Paganism absorbed and united a multiplicity of
    wildly differing but basically polytheistic religious groups in the
    1970's.   Perhaps what we are looking for could be called Gaean
    religion, because at the heart of our Unity is our identity as children
    of the same Mother:Gaia Herself; Mother Earth.  It is said that it's a
    wise child who knows its own Mother!    A  brief  digression on 
    etymology  here:  Who is Gaia, that we would name a movement after Her? 

    The name Gaia is the Greek name for the Earth Mother Goddess, She who
    was created by Light and by Love from the primal cosmic chaos. Pierced
    by the arrows of Eros, Gaia gave birth to all the plants, animals, gods
    and goddesses and of course the human race.  So Gaia is the Mother of us
    all according to ancient Greek mythology.

         From the moment that the people of Earth achieved the ability to
    observe the image of our planet spinning in all Her radiant blue-and-
    white splendor through the black velvet night, we have been impelled
    towards planetary identification.  We must inevitably begin to think of
    ourselves as one planet, one people, one organism.  The power of that
    image alone unites us, not to mention the concept that the past
    three-and-a-half billion years of terrestrial evolution resembles one
    vast embryogenesis.  Something is developing, hatching, unfolding as a
    self-reflexive mind capable of contemplating its own existence.  Gaia
    developed  increasingly complex eyes and extensions of Her eyes/our eyes
    in order to contemplate Her own image.  And now, having seen Herself
    through our satellite eyes, She is awakening to consciousness.  She has
    a face, an identity and now even a name, and so we inevitably come to
    identify ourselves through Her as Gaian.

         A Gaian movement would be deeply committed to communication and

    education.  Many tribal people and many of the old nature-based folk
    religions such as native Australians, Hawaiians, Siberians, Tibetans and
    Americans have come to the brink of extinction rather than to allow the
    mysteries of their sacred rites to pass outside their tribes.  Others
    have realized the need to become more eclectic if they are to survive. 

         The Gaian movement is presently small and largely unrecognized,
    since it is anarchic and not evangelical, but it has tremendous
    potential in having no single head and presenting a genuine answer to so
    many of the world's problems.  Its vision is, in fact, an idea whose
    time has come.  Yet there are still many obstacles, and revolutions in
    consciousness rarely happen overnight.  The greatest forces operating
    against a new Gaian renaissance are inertia and apathy. the watchwords
    of the .70s and .80s.  But winds of change are blowing, and by the time
    the century turns we will see that once again Goddess is Alive and
    Magick is Afoot!And you who think to seek for me -Know that your seeking
    and yearning will avail you naughtUnless you know the Mystery:That if
    that which you seek you find not within you,You shall never find it
    without.For behold: I have been with you from the beginning,And I am
    that which is attained at the end of desire.9
