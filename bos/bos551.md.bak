    This ritual was written at a time when I did not have a
    qualified Priest in my group.  However, it may easily be adapted
    for those groups in which the Priestess and Priest work
    together.  It may be just as easily adapted to solitary work.

                             SAMHAIN RITUAL

    Place an apple and pomegranate upon the altar.  There should
    also be a "planted" pot of earth for each participant - these
    may be arranged on the altar as well, if there is ample space. 
    Instruments of divination may be placed within the Circle
    perimeter for use during the ritual if you wish.  Arrange the
    altar as usual and decorate with Autumn leaves, pumpkins, etc.

    The Circle is cast and purified the Circle in the usual manner. 
    Dancing around the Circle in a shuffle step (deosil), all chant
    three times:

              The Moon is bright, the Crone is old
              The body lifeless - the bones so cold
              We all live and pay our dues
              To die in ones and threes and twos.

              Death, dance and play the harp
              Piercing silence in the dark
              The Woman's old with withered limbs
              Death beckons Her to dance with Him

              As She accepts the Dance of Death
              The Earth is cooled by ghostly breath
              To lie in dormancy once more
              To have Her strength and life restored

    Go to the Western Quarter and draw an invoking pentagram with
    the athame to open the gate.  Then evoke the dead by saying:

              All ye spirits who walk this night -
              Hearken! Hearken to my call!
              I bid you in our Circle join!
              Enter! Enter - one and all!

              Come ye, spirits of the dead:
              Be ye spirit of plant or pet
              Or human being who still roams!
              Into this Circle you are let!

              Speak to us of things unknown!
              Lend your energies to this rite!
              To speed your journey, we have joined
              On this sacred Samhain night!

              All ye spirits who walk this night -
              Hearken! Hearken to my call!
              I bid you in our Circle join!
              Enter! Enter - one and all!

    ................................................................................
    2424

    Bestow blessings upon the dead, saying:

              Oh Mighty Pan of the Summerlands:
              Guardian of the beloved dead
              We pour forth love on those you keep
              Safely, in your peaceful stead
              We bless those who have walked the path
              That someday, we as well, shall rove
              We offer peace unto their souls
              While resting in your arms, below

    Now is the time for divination (Ouija Board, pendulum, cards,
    etc.) and communication with those who have gone on before us. 
    Allow plenty of time for this.  [Note:  I have found that it is
    helpful to have a tape recorder handy within the Circle for
    recording any communications that may be "channeled" during this
    time.  Some people disagree with this suggestion, saying that
    the metal of this electronic device causes scattered energies in
    the Circle; however, if the recorder has been cleansed and
    purified as the rest of the ritual tools, the problem seems to
    be resolved.]

    When the divinatory processes are completed, the Priestess goes
    to the Western Quarter and draw the banishing pentagram, saying:

          Blessings be upon thee, oh wondrous Spirits of the
          Summerlands. We humbly thank thee for your presence in our
          Circle and honor you in celebration this sacred night.  We
          beseech thee, oh Pan, keeper of the sacred dead, embrace
          once again those souls within your keep and hold tightly
          to your breast those which have been lost and wandering. 
          Grant them safe passage to the Summerland, where they may
          rest peacefully in your strength until they are refreshed
          and reborn again in perfect love.  We bid thee all a fond
          farewell.  So mote it be!

    The gate is now closed.

    The Priestess goes to the altar and hold up the pomegranate,
    saying:

              Behold the pomegranate, fruit of Life ...

    The athame is plunged into the pomegranate, splitting it open to
    display the seeds.  She says:

              Whose seeds lie in the dormancy of Death!

    The Priestess eats one of the seeds, saying:

              I Taste the seeds of Death.

    The pomegranate is then passed hand to hand through the
    participants of the ritual, each eating a seed and saying to the
    next person, "Taste the seeds of Death."

    The Priestess then holds up the apple, saying:

    2425

              Behold the apple: fruit of wisdom, fruit of Death...

    She then cuts the apple crosswise, saying:

              Whose symbolism rewards us with life eternal!

    She holds up the apple, displaying the inner pentagram, and
    says:

              Behold the five-fold star - the promise of rebirth!

    Consecrate the fruit and wine.  Each person then tastes of the
    apple and sips the wine, saying to the next person:

              Taste the fruit of rebirth and sip from the cup
              of wine of Life.

    After libation, the Priestess presents each member of the group
    with a small pot of earth, planted with three seeds [preferably
    rue or lavendar].  She briefly explains to the group that this
    is the season of the seed - it is a time of dormancy, but also a
    time of re-generation for growth.  Further, as the seed rests in
    the earth, they should also take time to rest and re-evaluate
    their lives, metaphorically planting only those values which
    will enrich and enhance the growth within the Divine Self.  She
    then instructs them to name the seeds within their pots with
    three values they wish to incorporate into their lives, knowing
    that as the seeds sprout with new life, their lives will be new,
    as well.

    After the presentation, all join hands and hold them skyward.

    PRIESTESS    Thus is the Circle of Rebirth.
                 All pass from this life through the great god, Pan        
         But through My love you are all reborn
                 In the cycles of nature - through the Cosmic Plan.

                 In living we die - in dying we live
                 The fruit is first seed, yet seed comes from the
                                 fruit
                 In the mystery of life and death and rebirth
                 The Circle turns ever, and I am its root.

    ALL RESPOND     The Sun conceived in Darkness, cold
                    In the Shadow of Death, a Life unfolds
                    A shred of Light begins to burn
                    From Death comes Life - the Circle turns.

    Dismiss Quarters and Dissolve Circle.

    PRIESTESS      The rite is ended.

    ALL       Merry meet and merry part and merry meet again!

    Outdoor libation to the Lord and Lady, and the spirits of the
    dead.

                               -Kalioppe-
