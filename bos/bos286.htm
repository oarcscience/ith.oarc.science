                        Sigil Magic for the Professional Magician 

                                        by Areosol 

           

               I will assume that you are already initiated into the secrets of 

          Austin  Spare`s sigil magic. Consulting  with my clients  as a profes-

          sional magician, I am always confronted with the same question: Is the

          client`s  will identical with  my own ?  If it is,  there should be no

          problem  involved in  charging  the sigil  in  the client`s  stead  by

          myself. (The client, one  must remember, will usually not  be familiar

          with the basic tenets of sigil magic or even magic in general and will

          probably hesitate  to try it out for himself.) However, I believe as a

          matter  of principle  that  everybody should  vaccinate  his will  for

          himself. I do not feel happy with charging myself i.e. my subconscious

          with  other people`s  desires.   For example:  if Mrs.  X wants  to be

          brought  together with  Mr. Y  by a  sigil (love  spell), it  could be

          intersting  to  know what  might happen  if  the pertinent  sigil were

          charged by myself. 

           

               Accordingly  I had  to find  a means  to implant  sigils into  my

          individual clients in such a way that they are not aware of  what they

          are really  doing. At first,  talking with the  client, I will  try to

          find  the &quot;smallest  common  denominator&quot; out  of  a tangled  mass  of

          multiple desires. This will continue until the client is able to  word

          his or her statement of will (henceforth to be termed &quot;will sentence&quot;)

          in plain and unambiguous language. Following  this all contact between

          the client and myself will be abandoned  for two or tree weeks. In the

          meantime  I  will construct  the  sigil,  usually employing  the  word

          method, and sketch it  on a piece of parchment.  Very  often the clie-

          nt`s  name will  be encoded applying  the magical camea  of the planet

                                                                            1417

          pertinent to the client`s desire. I may then supplement the sigil with

          this personalised glyph. Then  I will outline  a short ritual for  the

          client in which will be hidden the charge proper of the sigil (employ-

          ing either the mantric method  or a variation of the so-called  &quot;death

          posture&quot;). 

           

               After a  while I will  send the client this  constructed sigil by

          mail including instructions on  how to charge it plus  possible addit-

          ional admonitions, if necessary. Most probably the client will have 

          forgotten the precise wording of his/her will sentence by now; neither

          will  he or  she be able  to draw  any conclusions  from these strange

          glyphs. After having  been charged the  sigil can  be sealed and  con-

          stantly worn in a locket, it can also be put  permanently in view e.g.

          as a wall  decoration. Some of  my clients have  placed or hung  their

          sigils nicely framed in their office rooms. 

           

               To charge  a sigil the following  method is very effective.   The

          client arrives for consultation. In some cases has to bring along some

          substance  imbibed with  his or her  Od. During a  small ritual client

          must close  his/her eyes  and place  the odic  substance on  the sigil

          which  will be lying  open in front  of him/her. Then  I will take the

          client`s finger and  prick it quickly and sharply with a small chirur-

          gical lancet. After the blooddrop has been smeared onto the sigil, the

          latter  will be  folded and  sealed immediately.  I then  admonish the

          client to  bear in mind that  this talisman must never  get into other

          people`s  hands.   This  charging  method is  especially  effective in

          working with protection or &quot;antipersonnel mine&quot; sigils. 

           

                                                                            1418



               Here are some examples relating to client`s feedback:  

          30.04. Sigil as wall decoration 

          24.06. Business enterprises developed well. 

          12.07. Protection/defence sigil, charged employing chirurgical 

                 lancet. 

          14.07. Client feels well and secure. 

          23.06. Sigil as a defense &quot;antipersonnel mine&quot; with codification of 

                 client`s name by the magical camea of Mars, charged with 

                 lancet. 

          09.10. &quot;Mine&quot; fully operative: sickness and accidents of 2-3 

                 enemies. 

          11.10. Sigil employed as a wall decoration. 

             11. Business successful. Sale of real estate to a monastry (!) 

                 has been agreed upon. 

          27.12. Sigil, mantric charge. 

          14.02. Client`s partner becomes more friendly and loving. 

          18.03. Partnership satisfactory. 

          17.06. Sigil charged spastically by myself in client`s stead. 

          18.06. Shortly before the potential buyer arrived for inspection in 

                 the afternoon, the last seat in the coffeehouse (sales 

                 object) had been taken, suggesting excellent business; 

                 immediately after inspection number of customers decreased 

                 again. 

           

          07.12. Fast charge of a &quot;combat sigil&quot;. 

          21.12. The idea incorporated by the sigil incarnates as a conscious 

                 wish in the target person`s love partner. 

                                                                            1419
