                       a compilation of neo-Pagan songs
                       from any place I could get them.

                 I am always interested in more. Please send copies of
                such to GREEN BOOK, c/o PO Box 35190, Phoenix AZ 85069.
              Please include the author(s) name(s) and copyright information.

                                      *

              Be advised that not all the songs here were written by neo-Pagans,
              so do not assume that a listed author is or is not a Pagan just by
              the fact that they wrote a song with neo-Pagan content. Some of the
              authors are just friendly to neo-Paganism. Some of the authors just
              wrote the silly songs for the heck of it. Some songs have no author's
              name attached. I do not know who wrote those, but would appreciate
              finding out.

              Many songs in here are under copyright. DO NOT record them without 
              the author(s)'permission! Many of the authors herein can be contacted 
              thru the address above, and, remember: when -I- turns ya into a newt, 
              you -stays- a newt!

                   This songbook is not for sale. It is FREE.
              If you sell it, my tame lawyer will turn you into a newt.
