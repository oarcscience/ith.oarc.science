                                      A Mother's Day Message 

              Everyone has a mother.  She is usually regarded with much love and
              affection, as the benign, loving presence in our childhood. That is,
              unless she was abusive, in which case her kids usually write books
              about her later.  But who could forget the apprehension and downright
              FEAR you'd have if you had pulled your sister's hair, or written on
              the walls with a crayon, or got caught snitching a cookie from the
              cookie jar. The fear was not that of an innocent victim of
              oppression, but of a wrongdoer facing just punishment.  The fear and
              loathing would inevitably subside after your behind would stop
              smarting, and she'd be back to being Benevolent Mom again.
                   As it is with our mother, so is it with the  Earth Mother.  Those
              who live in harmony with Her prosper, their needs met from Her bounty.
              Those who do violence to Her, however, risk Her wrath.  The Mother is
              not just mild Demeter and sweet Parvati, but dark Hecate, the fierce
              Durga, and the absolutely horrifying Kali. She cares for us and loves
              us, and Her patience is near boundless. But Her patience has limits. 
              We live in a  time when more rape has been perpetrated  on Her than in
              any  other  time of  our existance  as a  species.  Her Body  has been
              defiled by mining  and over-building. Her  exhalations have been  made
              foul by the smoke of cars and factories. And from Her Sacred Body, the
              Anglo has extracted  what could  be the seeds  of our  extinction--the
              Uranium used in both weapons production and nuclear power.  The sacred
              Hopi prophecies speak of the world being defiled by "...a bowl full of
              ashes."  This  could  mean  the various  atmospheric  and  underground
              detonations  of nuclear  weapons, or  the accidents  at  Chernobyl and
              Three Mile Island.
                   I  believe that this  Bowl Full Of  Ashes is not  only these, but
              refers to all the destruction we  have wrought on Our Mother.   I have
              had some  information revealed to me,  in a way that  seems to suggest
              that  the Mother  was speaking  to  me, both  through  Big Dreams  and
              through an uncanny transmission  I got while hanging out  at Sepulveda
              Dam Basin.  This is not a boast--this is something which I simply HAVE
              to talk about. We  who strive to walk  in harmony with The  Mother, be
              you Wiccan, or Shamanist, or just someone who cares, have an awesome
              responsibility.  Putting it simply, we are the ONLY FORCE STANDING
              BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AND HER RIGHTEOUS WRATH. 
                   Our  efforts might  not  be entirely  enough  to stay  Her  fury,
              considering  the  dramatic  upswing  in natural  disasters  that  have
              occured over the  last 10 years, but it  is obvious that WE  MUST TRY.
              Shamanism has been "rediscovered"  for a very basic reason.   It means
              the  possibility of healing this Planet and regaining awareness of Our
              Mother's will.  We must guard against this tradition being bastardized
              and  cheapened  by those  who commercialize  these  ways, and  be very
              careful  to not fall into the trap of  honoring Mother to the point of
              forgetting  the Sky Father, and forgetting that both Mother and Father
              are the ways that The Source Of All is revealed to us in a form we can
              understand.  We must  also be careful to  whom we reveal  information,
              being mindful  that an unstable mind  given some of this  knowledge is
              EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. But most importantly, Our Mother is calling us to
              restore our link with Her, and to work towards her healing.  We have a
              lot of work ahead of us.  Our very lives depend on it.
              For The Earth Mother...ALWAYS!!!!!

              Enju.
