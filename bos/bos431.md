                                         Descent Of The Goddess
                                    Copyright 1993 Durwydd Mac Tara

                         (With special thanks to G. B. Gardner, Freydis Vasa,
                          Julia Phillips, and Pyrocanthus Basileus)

                      In ancient times, our Lord,the Horned One, was (as hestill is)
              the
              Controller, the Comforter.  But men know him as the dread Lord of
              Shadows, lonely, stern, and just.

                  But our Lady the Goddess oft grieved deeply for the fate of her
              creations as they  aged and died. She would solve  all mysteries, even
              the
              mystery of death, and so journeyed to the underworld.

                      The Guardian of  the Portals  challenged her:  'Strip off  thy
              garments,
              lay aside thy jewels; for naught may you bring with you into this
              our land, for it is written that your True Self is the only fitting
              adornment for those in the realms of Death.'

                      So she laid down her garments and her jewels, andwas bound, as
              all
              living must be who seek to enter the realms of Death, the Mighty One.

                      Such was herbeauty that Death himself knelt,and laid his sword
              and
              crown at her feet, and kissed her feet, saying: 'Blessed be thy feet
              that have brought thee in these ways.  Abide with me; but let me place
              my cold hand on thy heart.'

                  And she replied: 'Why do you cause all things that I love, and
              take delight in, to fade and die?'

                  'Lady,' replied Death, 'it is age and fate, against which I am
              helpless.  Age causes  all things to wither;  but when men die  at the
              end
              of time, I give them rest and peace and strength, so that they may
              return.  But you, you are lovely.  Return not, abide with me.'

                        And she replied, 'Nay, I love theenot and I am needed in the
              world
              of the living.'

                   Again Death knelt, and kissed her knees, saying: 'Blessed be thy
              knees that  kneel before the  Altar.  Abide with  me; let me  place my
              cold
              hand on thy heart.'

                        And she replied, 'Nay, I love thee not and I am needed inthe
              world
              of the living.'

                   Death (still kneeling), kissed her on the womb, saying:
              'Blessed be thy organs of generation,  without which none of us  would
              be. 
              Abide with me; let me place my cold hand on thy heart.'

                   And she replied, 'Nay though I feel the beginnings of love for

                                               1923
              


              thee, I must return to those I fully love in the world of creation.'

                        Deaththen stood, and kissedher on thebreast, saying: Blessed
              be
              thy  breast, formed  in strength and  beauty.   Abide with  me; let me
              place
              my cold hand on thy heart.'

                   And she replied, 'Nay though I feel love for thee, I must not
              abandon those I am responsible for, in the world of creation. I cannot
              do this thing, better you would return with me.'

                   'Lady,' replied Death, It cannot be so.  If I were to leave my
              realm, and abandon those who seek their comfort and rest with me, then
              the Wheel would no longer turn.  Age and weakness would overtake those
              whom you  love, and they would  have nowhere to find  rest, and peace,
              and
              reunion with those who have gone before.  As age and debility overtook
              your creations, there would quickly be no room for the new, only the
              withered,  the  tired, and  the stagnant.'  He  then kissed  her lips,
              saying:
              'Blessed be  thy lips, which shall  utter the Holy Names.   Abide with
              me;
              let me place my cold hand on thy heart.'

                        And shereplied, Let us BOTHlay our hands, eachunto the heart
              of
              the other, thereby claiming and uniting each unto the other.  In this
              way may I rule my kingdom of birth, creation, and life; yet share with
              you your kingdom of death, rejuvenation, and rest. United in Perfect
              Love and Perfect Trust, that the Universe may be whole and the Wheel
              turn smoothly.

                   Death replied, 'This is indeed WISDOM, So Mote it Be!' They
              embraced, thus pledging their eternal love. 

                      And he taught her all his mysteries, and gave her the necklace
              which
              is the  circle of  rebirth.   And she  taught him  her mystery of  the
              sacred
              cup which is the cauldron of rebirth.

                      They loved, and were one; for there be three greatmysteries in
              the
              life of  mankind, and magic  controls them all.   To fulfil  love, you
              must
              return again at the same time and at the same place as the loved ones;
              and you must meet, and know, and remember, and love them again.

                  But to be reborn, you must die, and be made ready for a new body.
              And to die, you must be born; and without love, you may not be born.

                      And our Goddess is ever inclined to love,and mirth, and happi-
              ness;
              and guards and cherishes her hidden children in life, and in death
              she teaches the way to her communion; and even in this world she
              teaches them the mystery of the Magic Circle, which is placed between
              the worlds of men and of the Gods.

              And thus we are taught of the beginnings of the wheel of the year

                                               1924
              


              wherein the Lord and the Lady share their rulership of the year, each
              offering and sharing  a balance to  the other, and  the basis of  that
              sharing.
