                                                    THE MOONPOOL 
                  - 
                    It is a lazy, restful time 
                     here in the forest glade. 
                    The sun is departing, the stars arriving 
                     and the trees are a darkening jade. 
                  - 
                    An air of buzzing, drowsing stillness 
                     invades the meadow, lends weight to my head 
                    as I settle down - bedroll, backpack 
                     and strains of music are seemingly played. 
                  - 
                    A deep, cool, dark pool is here, 
                     mirror clear, reflections of skies, 
                    as peace fills my mind, my soul 
                     and sleep gently touches my eyes. 
                  - 
                    I know not whether I was awake, or in dream 
                     or how much time had passed, 
                    when I felt the magic of this place 
                     camped there, upon the grass. 
                  - 
                    No sounds - no crickets? (The Music!) 
                     As the Moon awakens the pool, so bright. 
                    Why this anticipation, premonition, 
                     this magical feeling, this ghost haunted night? 
                  - 
                    Then, a siamese cat enters the meadow- 
                     silver grey, regal compusure, flowing lines. 
                    And somehow I know - I see intelligence 
                     and wit, and power, as she looks into my eyes. 
                  - 
                    How does she speak without speaking? 
                     But somehow, she communicates good will, and cheer. 
                   'Stay quiet, childe of man.', she says. 
                    'Be still - you are but a guest here.' 

                   Then a parade of feline musicians 
                     wandered in singing from the right. 
                    I shake my head *bedazzled*; Am I dreaming, or mad? 
                     Why me - here to witness this eldritch sight? 



                                         THE MOONPOOL  (cont.)
                  - 
                    A troupe of dancing, cavorting gnomes 
                     made their appearence upon a rocky stage. 
                    And following them : silver clad, haughty elves 
                     accompanied by a wizened old mage. 
                  - 

                    Now, many strange but noble presences made manifest 
                     on that starlit night in June. 
                    And I witnessed and heard sweet music, high magic, secrets 
                     until dawn, with the passing of the Moon. 
                  - 
                    And the high bred Queen of Cat Folk 
                     smiled with warmth, and left. 
                    Left me shaking with these visions, 
                     and nodding, I finally slept. 
                  - 
                    I return often to these stately woods, seeking 
                     but never finding the sacred pool, so bright. 
                    It makes me sad - very sad to think 
                     that it was but a dream, a peculiar night. 
                  - 
                    But sometimes, at the edge of sleep, 
                     soft music slowly beckons, and calls. 
                    And I know with every fiber of my being 
                     that I will again visit these magical sylvan halls 
                 
                                                                                               1863
