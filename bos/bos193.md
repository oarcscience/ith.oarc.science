                                         destroy the False Ones who
                                         had exalted themselves and
                                         deceived some Mayas to
                                         worship them; and defeated

          18  -  Nucuch Chacob  -  "The Great Chacs"  Four horsemen

          19  -  Balanke  -  "Jaguar-Sun"  This aspect of the Sun is
                             the essence of Strenght (warrior-type
                             strenght).  He is considered a Great
                             Breast.  All His Priests and Priestesses
                             are His harlots.

          20  -  Xob  -  Mother of Maize.  All Maize Deities sprang

                              portantly is ruled the cacao which was
                              the Mayan's biggest trade commodity.

          22  -  Itzam Na  -  as Great God who oversees Justice
                              between the Gods and the Mayan who
                              worships the Gods.
          


          23  -  Ku Kulcan  -  The Aztecs called Him "Quetzalcoatl". 
                              He is the God of Self-sacrifice which
                              was done so the Maya could survive
                              and gain acknowledgement of Itzam Na.
                              Some myths place Him as the Judge of
                              the dead (but I would take this with
                              a gain of salt).

          24  -  Yum Cimil  -  "Lord of Death".

                         the Deer created the Vagina of the Moon
                         Goddess by stepping on Her abdomen and then
                         she was able to bear children of the Sun
                         God. Note the sole of deer's foot looks like
                         a Vagina).  Zip would deceive hunters to
                         believe he was shooting a deer when in fact
                         it was a iguana (a sacred animal of Itzam
                         Na; to kill one incites the Death penalty).
                         To those who gained Zip's Favor meant a
                         successful hunt.

          26  -  Ah Ahaah Cab  -  "Awakener"  He is associated with
                                  the Morning Star (Venus).

                 Buluc Chabtan  -  The God of Human Sacrifice and War.

          28  -  Bolon Tzcab  -  The Ruling-Lineage Diety.  He kept the
                                 Line of Itzam Na pure and made sure the
                                 Nobility of the Maya was strong.

          29  -  XAhau  -  as Moon Goddess.

          30  -  Kinich Ahau  -  "Sun-Eyed Lord"   It is said He had
                                 a golden Sun eye (some say it was
                                 almond eye) at the place of His
                                 Ajna Chakra.

          31  -  Hun Kak  -  "Unique Fire"  The Divine Fire that
                             consumes all what ever remains is
                             prepared for Divinity.

          32  -  Ben Ich  -  "He of the Starry Sky"


                                                                                 838
