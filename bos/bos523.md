                              *             
                                            
                   THE SONG OF WANDERING AENGUS
                               -Wm. Butler Yeats
                        recorded by Judy Collins
                                            
              I went out to the hazel - wood
              Because a fire was in my head 
              Cut and peeled a hazel - wand 
              Tied a berry to a thread      
              And when white moths were on the wing
              And moth - white stars were flickering out
              I dropped the berry in a stream
              And caught a little silver trout..........
                                            
              I had but laid it on the bank 
              And gone to blow the fire a-flame
              Something rustled in the air  
              Something called me by my name!
              It had become a glimmering Girl
              With apple - blossom in her hair
              Who called me by my name, and ran
              And vanished in the brightening air........
                                            
              Though I am old, with wandering
              Thru hilly lands, and hollow lands;
              I'll find out where she has gone
              To seek her lips, to take her hands-
              And walk thru long green dappled grass;
              To pluck 'til Time, and times are done:
              The Silver Apples of the Moon;
              The Golden Apples of the Sun...............
                                            
                              *             
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            


                                            

                                                                                2314
