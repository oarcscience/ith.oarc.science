         The  following is the comparison listing of Christianity and Wicca that

         Awareness,  in  response to  a request  from  a Christian  minister who
         contacted the League.

         Goddess/God have different names creating the impression that Wicca may
         be pantheistic. 
         ** Wiccans  use a book called the "Book of  Shadows". This is a working
         notebook rather than a scriptural text.
