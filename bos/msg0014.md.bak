Here is a very effective personal cleansing spell that I would like to
pass on to any who may have need of it.

Personal Cleansing

Choose candles according to your personal and daily preferences, I have
found that any will work. Run a bath with as hot of water as you can
stand. If you prefer, this ritual can be done in the shower. Use
whatever bath oils work for you. Visualize all the day's negative
energies surrounding you as you get into the water. Then, visualize all
that negativity being removed from your Self by the water. Focus on your
candle flames, meditate on cleansing your Self. When the water has
cooled to the point of being uncomfortable, pull the stopper, and say
these words: "Drain away these pains and troubles, As does this water
pure and free. Take with it all this day's distress. As I will, so mote
it be!" Dry yourself off and rub your preferred cream onto your body to
protect you from negativity over the night. Prepare to sleep well!

This spell has worked wonders not only for me, but for other Wiccans
that I have passed it to. I would be honored if you would choose to
place this simple spell into your online Book of Shadows.

Blessed be... Naddya
