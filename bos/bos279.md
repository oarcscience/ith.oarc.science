                                       Treatise on Mind 
                                        From: The Tigress  

                    Fromthe moment that 2cells form a zygote, wesee  the interaction

              of  informational process  - recognition,  communication, interaction,

              integration, re-stabilization and  reproduction and or  re-structuriz-

              ation.  This cycle of  life can be see from the barest combinations of

              any  two elemental  components beginning  at the lowest  atomic desig-

              nations  of  energy and  throughout the  continuum of  increasing com-

              plexity - perhaps far beyond our capabilities 

              to understand.   ***  If consciousness can be  defined as an awareness

              of integrity through this process of self recognition; then conscious-

              ness can be easily applied to that which is non-human.*** 

                

                    From the most basicinteractions of chemistry, wefind that evenon

              an  atomic level there is to be  found this type of consciousness.  We

              have  become aware  of the  atom's necessary  maintenance of  it's own

              structure  through the  evidence  of necessary  balancing of  protons,

              neutrons and electrons;  the importance of electron shell  valences is

              also a  reminder of this type of integrity.   Even on an atomic level,

              there is  a form of awareness  of self-integrity in order  to maintain

              structure and identity. 

                

                        This process ofawareness is alsoa geniusof discrimination. A

              form  of identification  of self  &  non self  on an  energetic level.

              There  is a borrowing, and sometimes a sharing energetically, yet when

              this process of self recognition begins to fail we see the destruction

              of the matter it  involves <this is evident with  atomic structure and

              also evident at the human level  in the study of cancer.> Therefore we

              might  look at  this process of  self-recognition and  maintenance and

              examine it's nature in order to find its function and capabilities. 


                                                                                1266

                

                        When we lookat different typesof matter, wefind that themore

              simple the atomic structure  of the mass, the less complex its process

              of  "consciousness" needs to  be.  Things which  are comprised of only

              one atomic component  do not need  complex processes of  communication

              between those components.   Thus the level of consciousness  is rather

              low on an evolutionary scale of creativity, yet we also see that these

              types of  things are far more  stable in regards to  their integrity -

              far less  vulnerable to destruction.   In example, it takes  an enorm-

              ously concentrated force of heat to break the integrity of an atom...-

              yet a  mere 2000 degree flame  will not only destroy  the integrity of

              human consciousness, but also destroy  the integrity of the individual

              component molecules which  form the material mass of  a human to their

              lowest forms as individual atoms. 

                


                                                                                1267

                        Whenwe look at theforces involved incommunication of energy,

              we  see  a flowing  medium of  different  frequencies within  a single

              spectrum  of  energetic  potential.   Elemental  energies  and  forces

              <light,  sound,  temperature,  pressure,   magnetism,  electricity...>

              differentiate and vary in  intensity and frequency yet are  very alike

              in  that they are all  means of transferring energy  as a form of com-

              munication which can be informative/stabilizing or disinformative/des-

              tructive,  depending  on the  structure  of  the "consciousness"  they

              encounter.  It  may be perceived that the more  complex the structure,

              the lower the  frequency of the  integrity of that  structure and  the

              more vulnerable that structure is to disinformation. 

               

                   The  more diverse the components  are that are  included within a

              thing,  and the more efficient  the means of  communication within the

              structure  of that thing; the  lower the common  denomination of freq-

              uency of integrity must  be in order that the  informational frequency

              will not be  destructive to any  of the component  parts.  To  analyze

              this statement we must look at other analogies within our environment.

              Firstly I would like to examine the nature of sound. 

                


                                                                                1268

                   Sound waves come  in varying frequencies and  modulations, and as

              humans we assign different  notes to those steps within  the frequency

              spectrum which we can  differentiate and perceive.  If we play several

              notes  simultaneously, we  find that  in order  to maintain  a balance

              harmonically, we must  play notes that  match each others  modulation.

              You can play a "C" note at any  octave and in fact play all "C"  notes

              simultaneously  and you  will  find that  within  the frequency  range

              these notes will compliment each other, in fact they will contribute/-

              share energy with each other.  WE find similar  matching if we look at

              musical chording.  If you play the  notes "F" and "C" , the sharing of

              energy  vibrationally between  those two ranges  of frequency  will in

              fact create  the note  of "A"  in  the range  in which  the two  notes

              frequencies  overlap.  In this way communication is informative and in

              fact the "whole  is greater" than  the sum of  its parts.   Similarly,

              playing  two notes which lie in the same modulation frequencies simul-

              taneously  will increase the duration of the vibration compared to the

              duration if each note were played alone. 

                

                   When  we examine  the  sharing of  electrical  information at  an

              atomic level, we see  that through the temporary sharing  of electrons

              in a phase  path also indicates  something that we  might consider  as

              investing a thing <atom> with more than the sum  of its parts.  Simil-

              arly in using electric  frequencies in a series, we  store information

              on silicon chips which invest them with more than they would be if one

              simply  looked at the electrical  and silicon components  alone.  This

              transference  of  energy  is also  a  transference  of information  in

              frequencies which in many ways we are still attempting to understand. 

               


                                                                                1269

                   Simple, one component things,  can sustain far higher frequencies

              of  energetic  transmission than  can  complex  components of  things.

              Frequencies which pass freely through atoms ultimately destroy complex

              things such as humans when they are subject to them.   It appears that

              the  more complex  the union  of the components,  the slower  and more

              tediously  complex the  transformation  of data  must  be.   The  more

              complex a thing is,  the lower the vibrational capability  it sustains

              in order to maintain the integrity of its own structure. 

                

                   Energetic  communication exists  infinitely throughout  the univ-

              erse.  The transference  of information through radio waves  and light

              waves continues back in time to the occasion of what was known as  the

              Big Bang.  It may be that in the future we will find that in the  same

              way gravity  and electromagnetism  are also continuums  of information

              from  times long past.   Scientifically we study  these energetic con-

              tinuums and yet we doubt and deny the holistic communicative nature of

              the  universe.  We search for causes  and effects within the realms of

              our limited  perceptions and are  amazed when  we can  find no  causal

              effects to explain change. 

                


                                                                                1270



                   When we  examine biological life, we find  that each evolutionary

              adaptation seems to be  an extension of the  process of self/non  self

              awareness  and maintenance of  integrity.  Not  only do  we see inten-

              sification  of sensory perceptual abilities, but also we note that the

              integrational and responsive/reactive   components of the process also

              have to  evolve and adapt in order to stay integrated with the rest of

              the "consciousness".   Amoebas are "simple" life forms, and yet we can

              examine them and see that each organic component within that life form

              serves  as an  informational  and communicative  component within  the

              process of maintaining the integrity <life>  of the whole.  When  this

              communication  process or any part  of it ceases,  the organization of

              the organism begins to deteriorate and eventually ceases and dies.  In

              biological life, we  find that  though we have  maintained the use  of

              electronic  communication on some neural  levels, we have  sunk to the

              depths  of transferring  actual molecular  compounds <proteins,  amino

              acids...> in  most of our  organic processes.   Even the  human brain,

              supposed  highest achievement  of  organic life  forms, requires  base

              molecular  salts in  order  to process  electrical  information.   Our

              complexity denies us the speed of light, radio, 

              and other  faster and higher  frequency modes of  communication except

              from outside of ourselves. 

                


                                                                                1271



                   The  human consciousness is a  genius of discrimination.   We use

              the abilities of  discrimination to identify those  stimuli which come

              from outside of our biological forms in order  to protect and maintain

              our integrity <life.   We use our senses <inefficient  though they may

              be>  to gather and interpret pure energetic communications such as the

              radiated  energy of sunlight and we are so inefficient at interpreting

              that data that we can only sense light and heat and it  destroys those

              sensors  that gather that information through blindness and sunburn if

              we continue too long in our attempts.  Yet, 

              conversely , we  need the information  from sunlight which  stimulates

              our organic forms  into producing  vitamin D <without  which we  would

              die>. Is  this a remnant  of photosynthetic  capabilities from  lessor

              complex integrations, or  merely a new  attempt at further  increasing

              our potential? 

                


                                                                                1272

                   As organic forms of  consciousness, we are sorely limited  in our

              perceptions  of the  universe.    Limited  in exploring  the  possibly

              limitless ranges of energetic exchange simply due to the limits placed

              upon  communication due to the complexity  of our component structure.

              Yet  rather than admit to our limitations, we seek further exploration

              through  the development of tools  made from things  less complex than

              ourselves.   In the laboratory, we  use light waves and shaped silicon

              to create microscopes to increase our sense of visual acuity within 

              the spectrum  of visible  radiation imaging.   In  the studio,  we use

              simple cones  flattened vegetable matter and  electronic amplification

              to create tools  to compensate for our  limited aural perception.   We

              have created many tools out of simpler  and less complex components in

              order  to reach  those  higher frequencies  of  information which  are

              either  so far removed from us as  to be imperceptible, or so destruc-

              tive to us that we dare not experience them ourselves. 

                

                   The  human zygote from the moment of conception is a discriminat-

              ing  consciousness which is involved in the differentialization of its

              components in order to 

              develop finer  levels of complexity.   This fetus is also  even before

              birth  learning to  interpret  communicative energies  from the  outer

              world in order  to begin definition of  itself, its integrity  and its

              maintenance  of  self apart  from the  influence  of "other".   Cells,

              joining together  in communication  to form co-operative  systems each

              with  separate responsibilities  to the  whole.  Organs  with specific

              functions  supporting the organism in its fight to maintain its integ-

              rity.   Consciousness of Mind, determining the difference between self

              and non self, regulating the integrity  of the whole.  This harmony of

              components within a symphony  of orchestration, this is the  matter of

              being alive. 


                                                                                1273

                   Despite our  complexities, despite recognition of our vulnerabil-

              ities  and limitations; we as humans are  beings of arrogant mind.  We

              claim supremacy over all biological organisms and claim the sole right

              to conscious thought <as if we  were the only from of communication we

              wished  to recognize.>   We  deny our insecurities  and lay  claims to

              great understandings concerning the  universe, when we in fact  do not

              even  understand the actual workings of our own process of integration

              and communication within our own biological forms. 

              We claim  ownership of consciousness,  yet we  do not even  pretend to

              truly evaluate the process of consciousness nor its beginnings. 

                   Despite our inadequacies,  we assume  to know the  nature of  the

              beginnings of  all life.   We claim to  know the "mind"  of "God" <the

              prime causation for all that exists> and we claim title to superiority

              in emulation of this "God" - above  and beyond all other forms of life

              or integrity.  An egotistic lot are we, who strive to seek security in

              the  midst of  our  fear, our  inadequacies,  our vulnerabilities;  by

              developing a system of belief which guarantees our security in a place

              beyond our perception.  We seek safety and foundation at the same time

              that we reach outward to claim flight amongst the stars. 

                   This is  the paradox on humanity,  of mind.  Complexity  found in

              simplicity... using simplicity to explore  a universe beyond the range

              of our complex integrity.  Our complex integrity vulnerable to all but

              the  simplest energies,  while we  lay grasp  to use  complex energies

              which would destroy us in order to  prove our strength.  What it is we

              look for, we  eventually find at the expense of  closing our senses to

              see what  really is.   Perhaps it  is true that  the most foolish  are

              those who lay claim to knowledge for they have closed their minds 

              to  further learning,  and  that the  most wise  are  those who  claim

              knowledge of no thing, that they may learn all. 


                                                                                1274

              ** MAGICK 1 -- WHY MAGICK ** 

               

                              Theability tothink seems toset usapart fromother crea-

              tures.  And  although we  are concerned  with  living in  the physical

              world, we are mental beings. The fact is we are thinking all the time.

              We plan, we brood, we get depressed or elated -- all of it is thought.

              But  the universe is mental too, and  if we could control our thinking

              we would see magnificent results in the everyday world. 



                              Manysystems have been developedover the agesto help us

              control our  thoughts. A great  amount of  dogma too  has been  kicked

              around in an attempt to make us into better people. Magick (the occult

              kind, spelled with a  'k') is one  of the oldest  and most general  of

              these  systems. Magick is the study and application of psychic forces.

              It uses mental  training, concentration,  and a system  of symbols  to

              program the mind. The  purpose of magick is to alter  the self and the

              environment according to the will. 



                              Mostofthe magickwesee todaycomesto usfromancient Egypt

              and Chaldea.  The Chinese,  Hindus, and Tibetans  developed their  own

              unique types of  magick. Western magick was locked up  by the Egyptian

              priests  for thousands  of  years and  then supressed  by the  rise of

              Christianity. It was not until  medieval Europe that magical knowledge


              was rediscovered by the alchemists and Cabalists. Only during the past

              hundred years  or so has  western culture been  open minded  enough to

              permit widespread investigation  of the subject. Only  since the start

              of the twentieth century has science shown much interest in it al all.

               

              PARAPSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIC PHENOMENA 

               

                              Through parapsychology, weare gaining insightsinto the

              hidden  nature of man. Parapsychology is  a branch of psychology which

              studies psychic  phenomena. It remains  something of a  frontier, even

              today.  Perhaps one  reason  for this  is that  psychic  phenomena are

              somewhat inconsistent. 

              Nevertheless, there  is strong evidence  from numerous cases  and exp-

              eriments in  support of  psychic phenomena.  Somehow, under the  right

              conditions, the mind can directly affect the environment. 



                              Wemaytheorize thatthehumanmind andbodybroadcasts akind

              of psychic energy or force, much like a radio station. Kirlian photog-

              raphy, temperature effects, cloud chamber tests, and other experiments

              tend to support this theory. Although the exact nature of this psychic

              force 

              is subtle and unknown, it is undoubtedly the energy behind all psychic

              phenomena and  magick. However,  it is  *not* a  radio wave,  since it

              behaves  somewhat differently.  The psychic  force is  too weak  to be


                                               1275


              measured directly  (at least  so far  as we  know). Everyone  has some

              psychic ability. There 

              are numerous types of psychic phenomena. Parapsychology separates them

              into two groups: ESP and PK...  

               

              EXAMPLES OF ESP 

               

                              ESP,theabreviation forextrasensoryperception, meansthe

              reception  of information  through paranormal  means (ie.  not regular

              physical  senses of sight, sound, touch,  smell, or taste). In theory,

              this is accomplished by receiving psychic force from outside the body.

              Here are some examples of ESP:  

                              1)Clairvoyance,orRemote Viewing--the abilitytosense or

              'see' (non-physically)  distant objects, places,  and people. Individ-

              uals who see ghosts and spirits are probably clairvoyant.  

                      2) Clairaudience, or remote hearing -- the 'hearing' 

              of paranormal information. 

                              3)AstralProjection(OOBE)or TravelingClairvoyance--Full

              experience at a remote location while the physical body sleeps.  

                      4) Psychometry -- the reading of information by the 

              touch of physical objects. 

                              5) Telepathicreceiver --the ability todirectly receive

              thought (communication) at  a distance, with no physical connection to

              the sender.  There are many  everyday examples  of this,  in which  we


                                               1276


              think something just as another  person is about to say it. This is an

              easy  one  to  test for  through  experiment. Very  dramatic  cases of

              telepathy  have been recorded; there is  often an emotional element in

              such cases.  

                              6) A 'channel'or medium, asin a seance,who is indirect

              communication with a 'spirit' or entity.  

                              7) Experiencewith a Ouija board,pendulum, or automatic

              writing. 

                              8) Precognition--to forseethefuture. Again,highlyemot-

              ional events are the ones most likely to be 'tuned in'.  

                              9) Retrocognition-- knowledgeof the past,by paranormal

              means. 

                

              EXAMPLES OF PK 

               

                              PK, the abreviation forpsychokinesis, is the active or

              sending side  of psychic phenomena.  The theory  here is that  psychic

              force is sent out from the individual. Examples of PK include:  

                              1)Telepathicsender --thetransmitterin thetelepathyjust

              discussed. 

                              2)Psychokinesis (ortelekinesis) proper-- theability to

              move objects by means of psychic force. 

                              3)Somewhatalong thesamelinesarepoltergeist(noisyghost)

              phenomena in  which objects move  of their  own accord  or noises  are


                                               1277


              heard. There is always a human  agent involved -- frequently a teenage

              girl -- who appears to be the source of psychic energy.  

                              4)Psychic healing-- theability toheal variousillnesses

              and  infirmities. There are many documented  cases of this. Usually it

              involves  a healer  and  a subject,  although there  are  recent cases

              invloving cancer patients learning to heal themselves.  

                              5)Teleportation, apportation,andlevitation. Someoccul-

              tists  feel a magician  producing PK effects  is simply a  channel for

              universal  energy. Others think the force originates some way directly

              within the magician. 

               

              THE SUBCONSCIOUS  

               

                              Postulated byFreud andothers, theconcept of thesubcon-

              scious mind is an important  one. Basicly, this is the idea  that part

              of the mind  normally operates below or outside of ordinary conscious-

              ness and  awareness. Dreams and  hypnosis are  examples of this.  Also

              subconscious are the many 

              automatic  functions of  the  physical body  such  as respiration  and

              digestion.

              WHY DO MAGICK? 

               

                              Magickencompassesmanythings-- scienceandart,philosophy

              and  metaphysics, psychology  and comparative  religion. Magick  is an

              adventure at  the borderlands of the unknown. It can fit the pieces of

              the puzzel of life into a meaningful whole. 

                              *Magick is fun*and interesting. Usemagick to helpraise

              consciousness without drugs.  Gain new experiences.  Fantacy  can come

              alive  through magick. Psychic phenomena can  be controlled and be fun

              and helpful. 

                              *Magick isbeneficial*. It canhelp you tohave excellent

              health, and bring you good luck. With magick life  runs smoothly; life

              is  good. Also use magick for  personality improvement, to control bad

              habits and to develop new motivations. 

                              *Magickis

              of magick. Use magick to alter events and to achieve your goals. Exert

              an influence  over people and phenomena. But power for its own sake is

              self defeating. The power which magick can give you should not be your

              primary 

              reason for studying it. 

               

              MAGICK AND WITCHCRAFT 

               


                                               1279


                              A numberof other occult disciplinesare prevalent today

              besides magick. There are many cults and sects which profess their own

              views, but there  are really few differences between them. One popular

              area in the  occult today is witchcraft. This is  far removed from the

              cliche of devil 

              worship. Real witchcraft is a nature religion  (pagan). Witchcraft has

              much in common with magick. 



                              Alchemy alsohas muchin common withmagick. It'sheritage

              comes  from the middle ages. Alchemy  fathered chemistry and the phys-

              ical sciences. But  the avowed purpose of  alchemy, turning lead  into

              gold,  is too  limiting to  be called  magick. Sometimes  the goal  of

              alchemy is interpreted  in another way, as  the transformation of  man

              into a spiritual being.  



                              Thentherearethe numerousmodernday seersor'pychics', as

              they like to be called, who  operate within their own somewhat  unique

              systems. Although many  of these people are  deluded frauds, some  are

              very powerful occultists indeed.

                              Of course,everything Ihavesaid hereis ageneralization.

              Magick, witchcraft, alchemy, or any occult field are complex subjects.

              Suffice it to say that magick  includes them all (it is eclectic). For

              magick is  undoubtedly a philosophy  which has,  as the late  Aleister

              Crowley wrote, 

              "The method of science -- the aim of religion."

              ** MAGICK 2 -- THE SUBJECTIVITY OF EXPERIENCE -- **



                      ' The universe is a projection of ourselves;

                      an image as unreal as that of our faces in a

                      mirror....We cannot affirm any quality in an

                      object as being independent of our sensorium,

                      or as being in itself that which it seems to

                      us. Nor can we assume that what we cognize is

                      more than a partial phantom of its cause.'

                                ( --Aleister Crowley, Magick, p. 110)

              it is  mostly based  upon the physical  senses(hearing, sight,  smell,

              touch, taste). These  five senses continually send  information to the

              mind, and it is up to

              the  mind to select and interpret  them. If you could  not do so, your

              senses  would overwhelm you and be  meaningless.  Selection and inter-

              pretation  of your sensory inputs  is essentially an automatic, mostly

              subconscious  function  of  the mind.  The  program or  map  which the

              subconscious follows

              as  its reference point  is called a  'model'. The model  is a subcon-

              scious  mental photograph  of  how you  believe the  world  looks (ie.

              worldview, mindset, egregore, or belief system).  It was built up from

              an early age  by your religious and cultural background through inter-

              action with family and

              others.  It  contains your  experiences,  attitudes,  and habits.  And

              whether  you  realize  it or  not,  most of  your  behavior, thoughts,

              feelings, and  habits are based  upon and  conditioned by that  model;

              even  personality. The  model is  one of  the mind's  master programs.

              Change in  behavior generally requires  a change  in the model.  These

              limitations built into our way of thinking cause our perceptions to be

              subjective.  That is  why  Hindu philosophy  looks upon  the  world as

              illusory (maya); the world itself (object) is not an illusion, however

              from our viewpoint through perception

              (subject) it is.

               

                              Thus weare allconditioned byexperience. Exceptthat our

              perceptions, hence our experiences,  are first conditioned and limited

              by the model. Our perceptions and experiences tend  to conform to what

              we expect. We tend to misinterpret or ignore things which do not match

              our

              preconcieved notions about them. This is automatic.

              THE TRUE WILL



                              The forgoingdemonstrates how itis thatthere are somany

              different versions of 'truth'. One's particular view is  almost arbit-

              rary. Although numerous  religions, philosophies,  and occult  systems

              abound,  they do  not contradict  one and  other as  much as  it might

              appear.  Rather, they describe the same (universal) reality taken from

              different  perspectives. For  there can  be no  ultimate truth  in the

              physical  world. We  can only  base our  actions upon  assumptions and

              agreements.  All experience  is  subjective. I  like to  think  of the

              universe as something indescribable,  perhaps a 4-dimentional 'thing'.

              As soon as we attempt to put it into our 3-dimentional knowledge-base,

              something changes and  we only see an aspect of  the big picture. Just

              as a photograph can only show us a flat *representation*  of a greater

              thing, so  it is with any  attempt to describe *spiritual  reality* in

              physical terms.

                              Yet,there isa separatereality withineach of uswhich is

              often ignored unless we seek  it. This inner self is in  magick called

              the 'true  will'. The  true will is  the center  of consciousness  and

              identity. It  is the 'real you'.   Everything else is  an interface or

              link  to it from  the outer (illusory) world.  Since that interface is

              based upon our model, it is conditoned and may sometimes produce false

              information. 'Do what thou wilt' (Crowley)  is an axiom of magick; for




                                               1285


              the true  will expresses  our exact  desires. And  what we  truly want

              ('down deep') we tend to automatically

              get. This  isn't always in our best interests, since the true will can

              be conditioned (tricked) by the illusion; and then we might desire and

              obtain  that  which  is not  ultimately  good for  us.  (Karma strikes

              again!) The task  of the magician therefor is to awaken his awareneess

              of the true will, to be free of conditioning, and thereby to transcend

              maya. ('My will unconditioned is magical' -- Spare).

              HAPPINESS IS BEING HAPPY



                              Thereis nogreatsecretto changingbehaviororhabits. Itis

              largely  a matter  of determination.  It equires  that you  ignore the

              'pull' of the model when you  strive for changes within yourself.  The

              model is, after

              all,  a collection of  'habits', some of  which must be  unlearned for

              permananent change to occur.  There are two ways  to do this:  direct,

              through will power and awareness alone -- observing  and acting out in

              an unattached  or indifferent  manner;  and indirect  -- through  con-

              ditioning such as  affirmation (explained  later), self-hypnosis,  and

              magick. Meditation may help too, by relaxing tension and conflict. 



                              Emotionsfollowphysical expression:smileandact happyand

              you  will tend to feel  and be happy. The same  is also true for other

              emotions.  Also,  emotions can  be  purposely used  (or  programed) to

              replace other emotions.   Using this technique, a magician is somewhat

              like an actor

              in that he learns how  to turn his emotions  on and off at will.  Note

              that this  is not 'fakeing it'; the magician is probably more in touch

              with his true feelings than most  people. And for these reasons we say

              that happiness is being happy.

              SYSTEMS OF MAGICK



                              Magickalwaysinvolvesself-hypnosis.However, itmaybemore

              than that. For  one thing, there are objective forces  involved (or so

              it would seem). Deities, spirits, and cosmic force can have  an indep-

              endent  existence.  And  the  repetitive  physical movement  sometimes

              involved in ritual can itself generate PK force. On the other hand, it

              could  be argued that all of  this is subjective to  the magician.  Or

              that  the deities  and  spirits are  nothing more  than  architypes or

              cosmic patterns  which the magician  energizes with his  own vitality.

              Perhaps all magical effects could be produced through hypnosis  alone.

              But the effects are certainly real.

                              Greatcomplexityisnotnecessaryinmagick.Although basicly

              magick is  a medieval system of  symbolism (in a  modern context), any

              cosmological system will work from Cabala to Star Wars. We usually use

              the  medieval one in magick because  it is convenient and traditional,

              and

              because  it seems  to  fit our  thought processes  well.   Traditional

              symbols have greater emotional effect on the magician than modern ones

              because of his familiarity  with them. What really matters is that the

              model of the magician be understood and programmed,  and thus that the

              model and the cosmological system do correspond.



              REVIEW QUESTIONS



              1) Contrast subjective with objective.

              2) What is a 'model'?

              3) Explain the task of the magician.

              ** MAGICK 3 -- THE FOUR WORLDS ** 

               

                              Theancientsdescribed manasmind, body,andsoul. Psychol-

              ogists of the  twentieth century added the  subconscious to that  def-

              finition. This  produces a  four-fold classification. The  universe is

              also divided into four corresponding parts ('worlds'), as shown below:

               

              WORLD                   BODY                      QUALITY 

              =====                   ====                      =======

              physical world     physical body                  physical senses

              uition, magical and  psychic phenomena, and is  the 'psychic link'  to

              the physical world. J.H. Brennan says that the astral is  the realm of




                                               1291


              visual imagination.  It seems  to be  both a 'place'  and a  'state of

              mind' at the 

              same  time. Most occult and magical  phenomena originate in the invis-

              ible, non-sensate,  non-physical realm (ie. without  physical senses).

              Each  of the  four  worlds interacts  with the  other  worlds. Psychic

              energy flows from the spiritual to  mental to astral to physical.  The

              physical world is a  projection (manifestation, reflection, or shadow)

              of the higher  worlds. Our center of consciousness is generally within

              these  higher worlds.  "We are",  to quote  the rock  music  group the

              Police, "spirits in the material world". 






























                                               1292




                              Therearemanysimilar termsusedby otheroccultgroups. For

              example, 'astral light'  is another name for astral world, although it

              may  sometimes also  refer to  the entire  non-physical realm,  as may

              'inner planes' or  'the invisible world'.  Planes are essentially  the

              same as  worlds.  Vehicles  or sheaths  are the same  as bodies.  Some

              groups  include an etheric or vital  body between physical and astral:

              it is mostly  'physical' with a little of  the lower 'astral' besides.

              And sometimes astral and mental are each divided into two parts (upper

              and lower). The 'causal body' is the upper 'mental'. 

               

              MICROCOSM AND MACROCOSM 

               

                              Wehavebeendescribing'traditonal'occultphilosophy here,

              and certainly  an important  part of  the tradition  is the  idea (and

              terms) microcosm and  macrocosm.  The greater  universe, known as  the

              *macrocosm*, includes everything that  exists. It corresponds with the

              *microcosm*, 

              or tiny universe,  ie. man -- who is thought of as a miniature replica

              of the macrocosm (whole universe).  This basic magical relationship is

              demonstrated in the  Bible (Genesis 1.27), where God is the macrocosm;

              and in the  writing of Trismegistus ("As above so  below").  Since man

              is in the image of  God (universe) it follows that God is in the image

              of man  (in other words,  man and the God/universe  match each other).


                                               1293


              The magician,  as a microcosm  is thus  connected with the  macrocosm.

              There  is an intimate relationship of  energies between you and every-

              thing else.   The universe is reflected within us and we are projected

              into  the universe.  This  is an  important theory  behind  magick and

              astrology. 

               

              MAGICK WHITE AND BLACK 

               

                              'Personalmagick' is thatmagick used toaffect the self;

              often   involving  affirmation,  self-suggestion,  and  self-hypnosis.

              'Active magick'  is outer directed  magick (as in  PK) used to  affect

              someone or thing, or to  bring about an event. 'Passive magick'  is to

              be affected (as in ESP) 

              by an outside non-physical cause. Everyone possesses some magical (and

              psychic)  potential. Some  are especially  gifted. Usually  people are

              better at one kind of magick (ie. active or passive) than they  are at

              the other kind; only rarely does an individual excell at both. Traning

              and practice will, of course, improve ability somewhat.  














                                               1294


                   Although the  forces of magick  are neutral, various  systems may

              take  on the  qualities  of good  and evil.  There is  so-called white

              magick or  good magick, black magick  or evil magick,  and gray magick

              between them. When many people refer  to white magick they mean magick

              for  unselfish purposes, also healing  and mental influence with spec-

              ific permission. By  black magick they refer to magick for self-inter-

              est  and  healing  *without* specific  permission.    Using  magick to

              forcefully control another's  will is, in a  sense, black magick  too.

              There  are also  some people  on the  occult fringe  who claim  to be,

              possibly even think they are,  'Satanists', devil worshipers, or black

              magicians.  These people  are most  likely charlatans,  hoaxters, dab-

              blers, or  merely misinformed. They may  be attracted by the  'art' of

              black magick, or even by the 'glamor' of doing something 

              against  the 'rules'.  But a  real black  magician is  very dangerous.

              Because he  has dedicated his life to evil. We usually think of 'white

              magick' as  having *unselfish intent*,  and (in  the extreme case)  of

              'black magick' as 

              being  actual  Satan worship,  human  or  animal sacrifice,  dangerous

              unconventional magical practices,  and other bizarre stuff  as makes a

              nightmare.  It is  all  a matter  of degree.  Most  mild self-interest

              magick (one of the most  common kinds) would be called 'gray'.  Better

              terms may be 

              *constructive magick*  as being  beneficial; and *aversive  magick* as

              magick  intended to work against the  natural order, and to tear down.


                                               1295


              There is also  the *high magick* of  spiritual alchemy (ie.  spiritual

              growth), also known as 'the Great Work'; and conversely  there is 'low

              magick' which is concerned with materiality.

              whether or  not the desired result is achieved.  Such side effects are

              no problem for constructive magick, since they are benificial as well.

              However, aversive magick can  produce aversive side effects  which may

              even harm the magician -- aversive magick is dangerous!

              MAGICK IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS 

               

                              Whatwe havebeencalling 'magick'is actuallya continuous

              process.  Since your  subconscious  never rests,  your environment  is

              continually  being shifted  into line  with your  model. This  is true

              whether you study  magick or not.  For most  people, these effects are

              usually very subtle, and they are probably not aware of them. However,

              as you work 

              with the occult,  the flow of psychic energy and  your awareness of it

              increases. Your  true will is  more likely  to be strongly  expressed.

              Your luck  may be affected (either  in a positive or  a negative way).

              Remember, our lives tend to follow what we want down deep. That is why

              a positive 

              outlook is so very beneficial to us. 

               





              THE MAGICAL DIARY 

               

                              Sometimes it ishelpful to keep a diary of your magical

              experiments and  research.  Such  a  diary should  include  the  date,

              perhaps even some  astrological data (or anything  else you think  may

              have a relationship to what you are doing).  This is also a  good time


                                               1297


              to begin recording your dreams  -- at least the important ones -- in a

              dream diary. Your dreams 

              can  tell you  a great deal  about yourself, and  may sometimes reveal

              premonitions.  Dreams  are personal.  Don't  fall  for the  commercial

              'dream book' gimmick. 

               

              AFFIRMATIONS 

               

                              Themind is always open to suggestion -- especially the

              subconscious. Most of  the time we censor any suggestions according to

              the model; but one way to break through the censor is with repetition.

              An affirmation does this exactly. By suggestion, we mean any statement

              which is capable of affecting your model. Usually suggestion is in the

              form of a positive statement (such as the hypnotist's patter  -- " You

              are becomming  sleepy"). An affirmation is the same kind of thing -- a

              positive suggestion,  which you repeat  (affirm) to yourself  aloud or

              silently  (for example,  "I  remember my  dreams"). If  there  is some

              quality you wish to change or develope within yourself, an affirmation

              is ideal. Repeat it several times every day at several different times

              throughout the day, 

              expecially when you go to bed. Affirmations are subtle and may require

              a few months to work. Use them for changes, not miracles. 

               

              SIMPLE BANISHING TECHNIQUE

              the  subconscious. A  good  example of  this is  the  simple banishing

              technique which  follows. Banishing is  used in  magick to 'clear  the

              air' of negative 'vibes' and interference...

              visualization for  a half a minute  or longer.   Good way to  help you

              handle your emotions, and to control worry or anger.

              ** MAGICK 4 -- ELEMENTS AND FORCES **



                              The Ancientsdividedthe worldintofour basicprinciplesor

              *elements* -- earth, water, fire, and air.   That viewpoint has mostly

              changed  with advances  of science,  but the  four elements  are still

              accepted in magick,  for they are more  closely linked with  emotions,

              the human psyche, and with nature than are modern  explanations of the

              world. These

              *magical elements*  are also of  some importance  in astrology.   Many

              occultists think of  the magical elements as forces, or as *qualities*

              of energy;  especially within  the astral world.   Each element  has a

              symbol and color. (Common symbols are -- fire: a triangle pointing up;

              air:  a triangle pointing  up and with  a horizontal line  through the

              middle  of it;  water:  a triangle  pointing down;  earth:  a triangle

              pointing  down and with  a horizontal line through  the middle of it.)

              Colors of  the elements are  -- earth: brown  and green; water:  blue;

              fire:  red; air:  yellow...The Eastern  tattvic system  uses different

              symbols and colors.  (The tattvic symbols are  briefly described later

              on in this course.)  The elements are often used in magick ritual.

                                                    betweenthings.Theserelationships

              are called 'correspondences'. Although magical correspondences are not

              literally equal to one another,  you can think of them that  way (such

              as gold  equals sun). Tables  of these relationships,  called 'Corres-

              Thus  one thing  or symbol  can be  used to  suggest another.  This is

              important in

              magick, for the magician may surround himself with as many appropriate

              correspondences as he  can to vividly affect  the senses; thus  making

              his magical contact with the inner planes more lucid.

              mythological entities called  elementals or nature spirits.  These are

              grouped into four main categories --


                                               1303

                              harpies



                              Elementalsareusuallyonlyvisible tothosewithclairvoyant

              sight  and are  more likely to  be seen  at night in  the mountains or

              country away  from cities --  especially if you  are tired  or sleepy.

              Although elementals exist naturally, it is also possible to create one

              which will exist for a limited time -- no elemental has immortality. A

              created elemental is called

              an 'artificial elemental'.

              the universe. However,  some contemporary occultists see  them only as

              symbols  for forces  and  otherwise not  'real' at  all.  Another word

              sometimes  used  for  elemental  is 'familiar'  (usually  in  medieval

              witchcraft); the term  is ambiguous, as it might merely be an ordinary

              household pet such as a dog or cat.

              occultists suggest  everything can be similarly  arranged into related

              opposite pairs.

              ** MAGICK 5 -- CHAKRAS AND MEDITATION ** 

               

                              AccordingtoEastIndianphilosophy,manpossessessevenmajor

              *chakras*  or  psychic centers  on his  body.  Each of  these  forms a

              bridge,  link, or  energy transformer;  changing pure  (higher) energy

              into  various forms,  and connecting the  four bodies  (ie. spiritual,

              mental, astral, and physical) together.  The chakras are located along

              the nadies  (a network of  psychic nerves or channels)  and follow the

              autonomic nervous  system   along the  spinal cord. Chakras  correlate

              with major  acupuncture points  along the 'governing  vessel meridian'

              (acupuncture term).  The seven major chakras are connected together by

              three major nadies  which are parallel and near each other. The middle

              nadi is called *sushumna* and it has neutral characteristics. The nadi

              on the left (ie. nearest your  left hand) is the *ida* nadi which  has

              yin characteristics. On the other side of sushumna 

              (nearest  your right hand) is the  *pingala* nadi, having yang qualit-

              ies.

                              The first chakra,located at thebase of the spineat the

              perineum is the *root chakra*, muladhara. It primarily  relates to the

              element of earth and to psychic smell.

                              The remainingtwo chakrasare very important.They relate

              mostly to elevated states of  consciousness. The *frontal chakra*, (or

              'third eye') ajna,  the sixth chakra, is located between, and slightly

              above,  the eyebrows.  Ajna is the  center of  psychic powers  and can

              produce  many psychic  effects.  Meditation on  ajna is  said  to cure

              nervousness.

              enment.

              YOGA 

               

                              Yoga originated inIndia. It is aphysical or mentaldis-

              cipline designed to condition and invigorate the mind and body.  There

              are many kinds of yoga,  but they may be generally divided  into three

              main types... 

                              Hathayoga--affect themindthrough thebodyusing physical

              exercises; improve physical health and endurance.

              concentration. 

                              Mantrayoga --affect themind throughchanting andaffirm-

              ation; achieve relaxation. 

               

              MEDITATION 

               

                              This is a much touted areaof the occult. There aremany

              meditation  techniques,  and many  claims  made  for  the benefits  of

              meditation. Basicly,  meditation has two functions  -- relaxation, and

              perhaps, improved concentration. There are two main types... 

               

                      1) concentration meditation (focusing), 

                      2) insight meditation (mindfullness). 

               


                                               1313


              Most  kinds  of meditation  are  the  concentrative type.  One  simply

              focuses his attention upon a single physical object (such  as a candle

              flame); upon a sensation (such  as that felt while walking  or breath-

              ing);  upon an  emotion (such  as reverence  or love);  upon a  mantra

              spoken aloud  or even silently; or upon  a visualization (as in chakra

              meditation, seebelow)...Concentration  meditation  is, simply  put,  a

              form of self-hypnosis. 

               

                              Amantra(or mantrum)is oneormore wordsorsyllables which

              are repeated --  often chanted -- aloud...A simple yet powerful mantra

              is  to vibrate  the  mystical word  'OM'.  This mantra  has  long been

              associated in India with the  godhead/unity.  Use it to aid  in tuning

              into universal  vibrations which  promote feelings of  harmony, peace,

              and well-being. Use it before magick ritual to 'get into the mood' and

              afterward to 'dismiss the 

              forces'. You vibrate  a mantra by saying it slowly  aloud in a lower--

              pitched voice  than your  normal speech, and  a more or  less constant

              pitch as well. Let the sound fade at the end of the mantra. A powerful

              one such as 'OM' will seem to vibrate the air around you. It should be

              vocalized  for 5-10 seconds and repeated a  number of times with a few

              seconds rest between each vocalization.  Chanting of mantras may cause

              slight dizziness from hyperventilation. 

               




                                               1314


                              Theothermaintype ofmeditaiton-- insightmeditation-- is

              the analysis  of thoughts  and  feelings in  such a  way  as to  cause

              realization of  the subjectivity and  illusion of experience.  This is

              done in  a effort to  attain trancendental awareness.  Such statements

              as, 'This  body is not me', fall  under this category. Buddhist medit-

              ations are usually of this type. 

               

              CHAKRA MEDITATION 

               

                              Thereis aspecialtype ofconcentrativemeditation whichwe

              will  call 'Chakra meditation'. This is  basicly Kundalini yoga -- the

              practice of  causing psychic energy  (kundalini) to flow  up sushumna,

              energizing the various chakras along the way. The practice, considered

              dangerous by 

              some, will produce  deffinite physiological sensations  and psycholog-

              ical effects  if continued long enough. It  should not be attempted by

              epileptics or persons with  an unstable mental or  physical condition,

              or with heart  disease. Certain drugs and  medications, such as  those

              used to treat  epilepsy may retard progress. Although the technique is

              very simple,  it may eventually produce powerful  results. Results may

              at first appear hours after the practice during  sleep. As each chakra

              is energized  by this practice, it  is said to add  occult powers (si-

              dhis), until  at last the crown  chakra is reached, and  with it, full

              enlightenment is attained. Sometimes kundalini awakens all by itself.

              the chakras, beginning with the root chakra, and moving  progressively

              up, as  you visualize psychic energy from the root chakra traveling up

              shushumna and  vivifying  each  higher  chakra. As  we  mentioned  the

              chakras have  certain properties  associated with  them, so that  this

              type of visualization may 

              'raise consciousness', promote astral  projection, and other things --

              once you have reached ajna and eventually the crown chakra. You  might

              typically  meditate in this  fashion for 15  minutes to a  half hour a

              day. It  might  help to  practice some  hatha yoga  or other  physical

              exercise  in an effort to  make the spinal  cord 'more flexible'. Diet

              may also  affect the  process. The  technique is  also similar  to the

              Tibetan 'Tummo'  meditation.    The  rise of  kundalini  is  sometimes

              experienced as a 'vibration' or buzzing, as light, or as heat.

              HEALTH AND DIET 

               

                              Certainly theway you treatyour physicalbody willaffect

              your mind. In magick you want an alert mind. Therefore, your body must

              be  as healthy as you  can keep it.  Take care of  your body. Exercise

              regularly.  eat a  good diet  (with vitamin  supplements), and  do not

              consume  anything which  will have  a negative  effect upon  the mind.

              Drugs, smoking,, and alcohol 

              should be restricted,  or eliminated. (The mind can create any condit-

              ion which a drug  can create.) A good rule here is  moderation in what

              and how  much you consume. (Most of this stuff is pretty obvious isn't

              it.) You may also want to cut down  on sugar and processed foods. Many

              occultists advise dietary changes,  expecially the non-eating of meat.

              We cannot deny the 

              physical, psychological,  and spiritual  effect which all  foods have.

              This  effect may  be  described as  the 'heaviness'  factor  of foods.

              Various foods are so ranked in the chart, lighter to heavier... 

               

                      1.  lettuce and other greens. 

                      2.  fruits and most vegetables. 

                      3.  wheat, rice, and other grains. 

                      4.  nuts, beans, and other legumes. 

                      5.  cheese, dairy products, including eggs. 


                                               1317


                      6.  fish, seafood. 

                      7.  chicken, poultry. 

                      8.  beef, pork, other red meats. 

               

              Note that  meats,  especially  red meats  are  the  'heaviest'  foods.

              Generally, foods which  are harder to digest,  or which are  higher in

              protein are 'heavier'  than those which are  not. Animal products  are

              heavier than plants. Foods high in carbohydrate (candy, bread, starch)

              are  heavy. However, the 'heaviness' of  foods is not directly related

              to the amount of calories.  






























                                               1318




                              Whatthismeansis thatforvarious reasons,theheaviness of

              food  in your  diet will affect  your magical experiences.  You may be

              able  to increase your psychic receptivity  ('energy level') by eating

              lighter foods, or  by eating less. Conversely, emphasizing heavy foods

              in your diet, or eating  larger helpings, may help to 'bring  you down

              to earth' should you 'rent the veil'  too much. These are generalizat-

              ions,  of course, and it may  take a number of  days of dietary change

              before  you notice  much  effect. I  do not  advocate  radical dietary

              changes, excessive fasting,  or malnutrition. Your good  health is far

              more  important  in  magick than  any  temporary effect  you  get from

              prolonged starvation. A change in diet will sometimes only 

              produce  a temporary  effect, until  the physical  body adapts  to the

              change. Healthy natural foods and  lifestyle make it easier for  us to

              be  healthy, but  ultimately, good  health is  a mentual  quality (at-

              titude). 

               

              THE FOUR-FOLD BREATH 

               

                              With physicalexercise too, moderation isadvised.  (You

              should  be cautious, or  not attempt it  if you have  a respiratory or

              heart  condition. Check  with your  physician if  in doubt,  and don't

              overdo.) One of  the most useful physical  exercises is pranayama,  or

              controlled  breathing (actually a  type of  hatha yoga  exercise). For


                                               1319


              this and any other calesthentics or  hatha yoga which you might choose

              to do  a 'kitchen timer'  is suggested (many of  these aren't accurate

              for under three minutes, but are helpful for longer periods).

                              Themain purposeofpranayama isto relaxthe bodyand mind.

              There are many kinds of pranayama, but a simple one called the 'four--

              fold  breath' will suffice. This consists  of four short quick inhall-

              ations, then  four short  quick exhallations; then  repeat, continuing

              until the allotted time is used  up. It will take about 1 1/2  seconds

              for  the  four inhallations,  and  about 1  1/2 seconds  for  the four

              exhallations; or about  3 seconds for the complete in-out cycle ('rep'

              for repetition). There  should be  no strain of  any kind during  your

              pranayama. You  will probably notice a  slight dizziness, particularly

              at  first, since  the effect  of pranayama  is to  hyperventilate. Try

              sitting back in a chair with your eyes closed when you  do your prana-

              yama.  Begin a minute a day for  the first week and gradually increase

              up to about five minutes a day. If you do the pranayama befor 

              your magical activity, it will help you to get 'into the mood'.  It is

              also an excellent  aid to relaxation and  tension release.   Pranayama

              should not  be done during  heavy air  pollution. Other exercises  you

              might consider are hatha yoga, calesthentics, walking or jogging.

              ** MAGICK 6 -- THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS ** 

               

                              Although there are hundredsof kinds of divination, the

              principle ones are  astrology, geomancy, the tarot,  the I Ching,  and

              direct psychic  means (especially  clairvoyance).  True  divination is

              more than  a mechanical system,  for it  implies true psychic  interp-

              retation (receiving). Some  form of divination is often used in magick

              ritual to communicate with 

              the entity invoked. 



                              Sincedivination operatesthroughthemind,itisaffectedand

              biased by the  mind. Our attitudes and  fears may alter  it. Sometimes

              results are very detailed,  and accurate -- but not always.  Often the

              future  is plastic and  changeable anyway, and  the use of  magick may

              alter the result.  Thus divination shows tendencies only, which may be

              helpful, but must not rule us.

                              It ispossible toimprove yournatural abilitywith clair-

              voyance through  practice. A good  start might be to  look around you,

              then  close your  eyes and try  to picture your  surroundings. This is

              also  good exercise for visualization. And  visualization is an essen-

              tial talent  in magick. Open your eyes  again and check your accuracy.

              Then close your eyes and try it 

              again. When you  use your  physical eyes,  look at  everything like  a

              child seeing it  for the first  time. Let the  vividness of color  and

              form burn into you, until everything takes on a veritable glow. Try to

              capture that  glow  when you  close  your eyes  now and  picture  your

              surroundings. It's just a simple step to extend what you see with your

              eyes closed  into what you remember  seeing in the next  room, or what

              you *imagine*  seeing in the  next building, the  next city,  even the

              other  side of the world. Don't  expect perfect results, especially at

              first.  Just try  to  be even  partly right.  Another  exercise is  to

              picture a clock face, and thereby tell the time 

              clairvoyantly.

              THE AURA 

               

                              Underthe rightconditions,it ispossible toclairvoyantly

              observe  a colored  light around other  people. This  is known  as the

              'aura'.  Sometimes the aura is seen as multi-colored emanations around

              the person, built  up of various differently colored layers and zones.

              Although many 

              occult dabblers claim to be able to see the aura easily and under many

              varied conditions, I seriously doubt that they do.   There are optical

              illusions and qualities  of sight which can  sometimes trick one  into

              thinking he  sees what he does not  see. In this area,  the quality of

              sight known as after image is especially pertinent. Do  this: stare at

              any solidly colored bright object for a few moments. Very intense red,

              green, or  blue are especially good for this. Now look away at a white

              surface and you  will see a phantom image  of the object in  its comp-

              lementary  color (a  red object  will show  green, a blue  one orange,

              etc.).    If the bright object is in front of a light surface, you may

              observe a fringe of complementary color 

              around the object after a few moments. This is all very normal, and is

              used  by some  magical  groups as  an aid  to  visualization sometimes

              called 'flashing colors'. Some silly people will stare at other people

              in the  same way. And when  they see the  after image of  the person's

              clothing,  they think they are seeing  his aura. What is more, various


                                               1325


              meanings have been attributed to the colors of the aura. A psychic who

              can  see the  aura is supposed  to be  able to  determine that persons

              emotional state. Thus  psychic frauds can have  a marvelous time  with

              auras.   One deluded  psychic taught  a class I  attended in  which he

              performed instant psychoanalysis on the 

              basis  of the  supposed aura.  It  was obvious  that  he was  actually

              observing after images from the students clothes!

              It is a general guide, based mostly on Theosophical material.  Various

              groups  may attribute different meanings to the colors.  The colors we

              show  on the  chart are  emotional in  nature; useful  if you  plan to

              create an artificial elemental or do healing.     Surrounding yourself

              with  a particular  color will  tend to  produce the  specific psycho-

              logical  effect described  in the  chart.   That quality  of color  is

              useful in magick ritual.

              THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS 

               

                   Whenever  we concentrate  our  thoughts, we  draw psychic  energy

              together.   This is  called a  thoughtform.   Usually the  energy dis-

              sipates  as soon as we break the  concentration, but it is possible to

              purposely  concentrate  energy  in  this way,  producing  very  strong

              thoughtforms.  Such thoughtforms are 

              vortexes or centers of psychic energy.  They  can exist as entities by

              themselves,  at least  for  a while.   They  are  basically inanimate,

              non-thinking forces.  Talking to one is about as logical as talking to

              a chair.  In this way, thoughtforms are similar to elementals, ghosts,

              and  spirits.   All of  these psychic  entities consist  of a  psychic

              energy vortex  which could be described  as a localized field  or as a

              discontinuity of the physical world. 



                   Psychic entities  respond to  certain electrostatic and  magnetic

              fields,  and to  other energy  vortexes. That  is why they  respond to

              magick  ritual. Someday, we may accomplish  the same thing with elect-

              ronic  machines. Psychic  entities are  sometimes able  to affect  our

              thought processes. 



                   Thoughtforms, elementals, and ghosts  are usually not very smart.

              If they display any  intelligence at all, it is limited.  They are the

              morons  of the  spirit world.   Their  behavior is  usually automatic,


                                               1329


              repetitive, robot-like (just  like some people).   We see that  artif-

              icial elementals 

              are little  more than  astral robots.   Spirits and  deities are  more

              intelligent and volitional. 

               

              DIRECTED ATTENTION 

               

                   Your  mind  follows  your  attention. Wherever  you  direct  your

              attention, there will  your thoughts go too. By directing attention to

              a specific place or purpose you *focus* mental energy upon it. 



                   For  example: you're  having lunch  in a  cafeteria crowded  with

              people. It is a large place, and everyone there is talking at once, so

              that  the room is a  constant jumble of noise.  You happen to notice a

              man accross  the room; he reminds you of someone. All at once he drops

              his fork and you hear it hit the table. But would you have noticed the

              sound of his fork if  you had not been  looking? No. Only by  focusing

              your attention there were  you able to pick out that  individual event

              and associated sound. 












                                               1330




                   It is a dark night.  You are walking and the only light  you have

              is from the flashlight you hold in your hand.  As you move  the flash-

              light around, the  beam of light from it directs  your attention first

              one way then another. Now, the mind is something like  that flashlight

              in the  dark. And by  directed attention,  you point the  mind to  one

              place or another. As with that flashlight beam, you see where the mind

              is pointed; nothing more. The rest is 'noise'. And so  we could define

              mental noise as anything not focused upon. In another way, noise could

              be considered as negative emotions, attitudes, and thoughts which make

              it more difficult to direct the attention. 



                   Your emotions  follow your  thoughts quite easily.  Your emotions

              are  not YOU, but are rather reactions  prompted by your model and ego

              -- like  a performance or  an act,  while the real  you watches.  In a

              similar way, directing your  attention toward a specific emotion  will

              cause you to 

              experience that emotion.

              ** MAGICK 7 -- BASIC RITUAL ** 

               

                      'The first part of every ceremony is the 

                      banishing; the second the invoking.' 

                                 (--Crowley, Magick, p. 104) 

               

                              Itmay besaid that ritualis thevery heartof magick. For

              it is through ritual that we  achieve our magical results. Ritual is a

              magical  procedure  or  ceremony we  perform  in order  to  change the

              environment.  Usually we think of ritual  as bearing on active magick,

              although certainly, it  can also affect passive magick. Most often the

              change achieved is subjective (it may  be subtle) and in the  physical

              world. Outsiders may put them down to coincidence, but the effects are

              very real. Magical goals for a ritual should not be taken lightly. 



                              Thesuccessfulpracticeofmagick dependsuponstrongbelief.

              The simplest  ritual of  them all  must be belief  itself. If  you can

              believe in your desired results strongly enough, that act is a magical

              ritual which will achieve your results. Even a very  complex ritual is


                                               1334


              no more effective  than strong belief. There are aids to concentration

              which  may help.  Thus  in *creative  visualization*, imagination  and

              controlled breathing are brought into play.

              CREATIVE VISUALIZATION 

               

                              Whenyouwanttomagicallyachievesomething,first pictureit

              clearly in your  mind. The more  deffinite and specific  your idea  of

              what it  is the better. Picture  yourself having it or  doing it. Vis-

              ualize it as vividly and as intensely  as you can and hold it in  your

              thoughts for a few 

              moments. Concentrate on it intensely (it may help to hold your breath-

              ). Feel the energy of desire welling up inside you. Then suddenly feel

              the image or desire released from your mind. Feel the energy filtering

              through the image and intensifying it, as if the image is a 'stencil'.

              Imagine the 

              energy exploding  out from you into the macrocosm in all directions at

              once, and  feel the universe 'tilt' as it reacts to the force. (At the

              same time  it may  help  to release  your breath  suddenly). Feel  the

              energy draining from you.  Finally, *believe* that your  purpose *has*

              been accomplished; that it 

              HAS HAPPENED, perhaps saying something such as "so mote it be", or "it

              is done".

                              Often ritualsare more formalthan theabove, but anyfull

              magick ritual  must always reduce  to these stages  -- 1)  imaging; 2)

              building; 3)  firing.  Sometimes a  ritual must be  repeated every day

              for a while to achieve difficult results or to overcome weak belief.

              THE MAGICK CIRCLE 

               

                              Often animportantpartofformal ritualisthemagickcircle.

              Medieval magicians  considered the circle essential,  and placed great

              emphasis  upon its exactness.   Elaborate  designs were  invented with

              many layers of complex  symbols and words. It was very  important that

              the circle 

              be completely  intact with no breaks in it. The magician and any other

              participants stand in  the circle during ritual. The ritual began with

              a banishing of evil  forces (using the lesser ritual  of the pentagram

              for example) to keep them outside  the circle. Today, circles are made

              on the floor with chalk  or paint, rock salt, or a  rope. Whatever its

              form, the  circle is still an important part of magical protection for

              the magician. This is especially  important for aversive entities  and

              purposes. The  circle also helps in focusing  the energy of the ritual

              toward its purpose,  that is, it keeps it contained until the magician

              is ready to release it. Of course, the magick circle is basicly only a

              symbol, but  it may eventually  be possible  to supplement the  circle

              with electronic equipment for a 

              similar  purpose.  We are  researching  the  practicality of  electro-

              staticly charged Faraday shields.  

               

              ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS 


                                               1338


               

                              An artificial elemental isuseful for certain tasks: 1)

              invisible  watcher and observer, telling you  what it sees; 2) psychic

              guard; 3) it can  be used in healing; 4) it is  helpful in other ways.

              Ophiel calls the artificial elemental a 'familiar'. Producing your own

              artificial elemental is fairly easy.  YOU MUST ASSUME THAT THE ACT HAS

              PRODUCED RESULTS, EVEN IF  YOU DO NOT IMMEDIATELY OBSERVE THEM.  It is

              entirely possible to produce one of these little beasties and not know

              it (not being clairvoyant enough to 

              observe it directly).  Therefore, and this is  a general principle  of

              any  magick, never ignore forces you have set into motion. Even though

              you may not see the elemental, you may nevertheless 'feel' it.  



                              WARNING-- Donot useartificial elementalsfor anykind of

              aversive magick  at this point; they  can be nasty little  critters to

              get rid of. Should you have to eliminate one of them which you created

              in error, you  must re-absorb it back into yourself through your will;

              or in some cases you can 'exorcise' it. 

               

              HOW TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTAL 

               

                              You cancreate your own artificialelemental for various

              purposes. An artificial elemental is basically a thoughtform which has

              been  strengthened with emotion. Refer to  the aura color chart in the


                                               1339


              previous lesson  and decide what  color to  make the elemental,  based

              upon  your intended purpose. Apple green  is a good choice for general

              purposes. 

              Then  decide on  a shape  or outline.  Do you  want your  elemental to

              resemble some sort of animal? A simple circle or cloud is a good place

              to start. With  this in mind you can use ritual to create your elemen-

              tal.  Creative visualization  is good  for this. Visualize  it glowing

              before you. A darkened room is helpful for this. 



                              Communicatewithyourelementalwith telepathy,bytalkingto

              it,  or  with creative  visualization.  Your  artificial elemental  is

              closely  linked  to  you and  your  subconscious attitudes.    It will

              generally not  do things  you think  it cannot do.  As in  any magick,

              results relate  to effort  and belief.  Another way of  looking at  an

              artificial elemental is  as an aspect of your personality (sub person-

              ality) which has been detached from you. 

               

              INVOCATION 

               

                              Formalritual usually involves the invocation (ritually

              calling up)  of a god  or goddess,  spirit, or other  entity. In  this

              sense, magick  is somewhat similar  to pagan religion  and witchcraft.

              However, we  consider  magick  ritual a  technique,  not  a  religion.

              Worship need not be involved. 


                                               1340


              Sometimes the invocation of an entity creates an artificial elemental.

                      Crowley says there are three different kinds of 

              invocation -- 

                      1) Devotion to the entity (as in the Bhakti yoga of 

              the Hare Krishna sect; the Faustian devil pact). 

                      2) Ceremonial invocation -- usual method of the 

              middle ages. 

                      3) Drama -- usually needs more than one person (as in 

              a mass).

                              Becauseof themicrocosm-macrocosmidentity,whenyouinvoke

              the gods, you are invoking  aspects of yourself. Jung has  referred to

              the gods as primitive archetypes.   This makes it sound like spiritual

              entities are  illusions. But in fact  the microcosm-macrocosm identity

              does not  discredit the  gods and goddesses.  It instead helps  to il-

              lustrate our relationship to the cosmos.

              something similar to, though not exactly the desired goal. If the true

              goal is delayed  (as sometimes happens)  we may see  the side  effects

              first. And if for some  reason the goal is  not achieved at all  ('mi-

              ssing the target')  the side effects may  be pronounced. Examples:  1)

              You use magick  ritual to hurry shipment of  an anticipated package in

              the mail. Side effect -- the next day an unexpected package (the wrong

              one)  arrives instead. 2)  You use  magick ritual  to cause  a certain

              person to phone you. Side effect -- for several 

              days all sorts of people phone you...The sides effects will not affect

              you (or anyone else) adversely unless that is what you inwardly want. 


                                               1342


                              3.We maysaywith certaintythat"something alwayshappens"

              when  we perform  a magick  ritual. But  like everything  else, magick

              follows  the 'law of results'. This  means that results require effort

              of some kind.  And if you don't  work hard enough at it  you don't get

              results. Difficult goals have  greater resistance (magical inertia) to

              overcome. If the ritual doesn't produce the desired results there is a

              good chance that  the reason for the  failure is within oursleves.  Be

              certain there is  no contradiction between your model and your magical

              goals. Sometimes self doubt and mental 

              contradictions  (wanting and not wanting at  the same time) may inter-

              fere. The  first step in magick  is to re-program your  model. And, of

              course you  can help your magical  results by working on  the physical

              level toward  your goals. Don't expect  them to fall into  your lap by

              themselves.

              of a ritual are not  usually instantaneous. There is often a  delay of

              12 hours or more. Difficult tasks  or weakly performed ritual are more

              likely to be delayed. In most cases  a slight delay is alright, and it

              gives us  time to get used  to the comming changes.  And sometimes the

              effects of a ritual 

              appear to extend to before the ritual was performed! 



                              5)Because of theway magick works,a ritualmay create an

              emphasis  in what  is sought,  and a  de-emphasis in  everything else.

              Balance  is  therefore important  here.  Once  the magical  result  is

              achieved it may be 'bound'  to you and difficult to get  rid of should

              you later decide to do so. 



              Example: You use a magick ritual to help you find and buy a new house.

              Years  later when you  decide to  sell it,  you are  unable to  do so.

              Consider your magical  goals wisely so  you dont  get stuck with  som-

              ething  you don't really  want. Note that  theory says you  can always

              unbind through ritual what was bound to you...theory says. 



                              6) Sometimesthe environmentappears to reactagainst the

              magick after the results are achieved. This is particularly noticeable

              in  using magick to  affect the weather  (and the main  reason why you


                                               1344


              should  NOT use  magick  to affect  the  weather). For  example...Your

              performance  of a ritual to produce a  sunny day produces a sunny day.

              The next day is sunny, alright, but the rest of the month is  cold and

              overcast. Here  the weather seems  to react to  the magick in  the op-

              posite  way to re-establish its natural  balance. It is something like

              pushing a pendulum to one side and releasing it -- the pendulum swings

              to the other side. To quote 

              Emmerson  -- "For everything you gain  you lose something...". I don't

              know that  this is always true  in magick, but it  does illustrate the

              point. And another  reason not to use magick to  affect the weather is

              that it might foul it up in other parts of the country (world??). 



                              7) Finally,magickritual(orany magickoroccultism)isvery

              dangerous for the  mentally unstable. If you  should somehow 'get  out

              too  far', eat 'heavy foods' as  previously discussed (lesson on chak-

              ras)  and  use  your religious  background  or old  belief  system for

              support. But remember too, that wierd  experiences are not necessarily

              bad experiences.
