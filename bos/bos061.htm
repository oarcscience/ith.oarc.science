<h1 align=center>What Is D.A.W.N.?</h1>

<p>The Denver Area Wiccan Network is a group of pagans and friends from a wide variety of Craft
traditions. DAWN sponsors parties, group rituals, a student/teacher network and other activities
as inspired or impelled.</p>

<p><b>Why do I want to join DAWN?</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>You want to be part of an active, growing community of Wiccans who can work together to make
 some changes in their world;</li>
 <li>You want to meet people and make new friends who share your basic values--people you
 can be yourself with, no need to keep your cover;</li>
 <li>You want an ongoing opportunity to exchange views and information with people from groups or
 traditions other than your own;</li>
 <li>You want to be in on the creation of a Denver pagan extended family which will make all the
 above possible;</li>
 <li>You like hugs, and you enjoy being warmly welcomed.</li>
</ul>
 
<p><b>Do I have to &quot;Go Public&quot; to be a member?</b></p>

<p><ul>No. Only the Board Chair and Secretary are expected to be &quot;public,&quot; and the
identities of all other members are fiercely protected.</ul></p>

<p><b>How do I join?</b></p>

<p><ul>Dues are $13 per coven, $5 per solitary, payable twice yearly in May and November. These
cover the cost of mailings and the setup costs for parties and rituals, as well as other costs
authorized by the Board and/or Steering Committee.</ul></p>

<p><b>Do I have to join DAWN to participate?</b></p>

<p><ul>No. All parties are open to pagans and friends. To find out about them and other DAWN
functions, write us at the P.O. Box listed below (postage is appreciated) or call Bob Key on his

  the last known address of the Director and proper postage thereon prepaid, or when the given

  date, time, and place of the meeting.</li>
  <li>The Board may make rules to govern the conduct of its own meetings.</li>

 <li>AMENDMENTS<br>

 both bodies having received at least 20 days notice of the proposed
 amendment.</li>
 
 <li>ELECTIONS<br>
 On the second Sunday in October, The Steering Committee shall meet to
 hold an election. At this time, the Steering Committee will elect
 replacements for Directors whose term is expiring. Names will be taken in
 nomination, consent obtained from those nominated, and one ballot cast.
 Each Committee member, including retiring and interim Directors, shall have
 as many votes as there are vacancies. The qualified candidate with the
 most votes will fill the first vacancy - two year terms being filled first.
 As each vacancy is filled, members of the successful candidate's coven are
 stricken from the list. If only one vacancy remains and either part I.A.2
 or part I.A.3 of the Bylaws has not been fulfilled, then only those
 candidates who meet the criterion can be selected; otherwise, the position
 will remain vacant to be filled by the Board, as soon as possible, by
 appointment. If a tie exists between equally qualified candidates, where
 all may not serve, a runoff election shall be held between those
 candidates. Misspellings shall not invalidate ballots where the
 appropriate person can be discerned; nor shall voting for fewer than the
 number of vacancies. Voting for too many candidates shall invalidate that
 ballot. No individual shall vote more than one time for the same person;
 therefore duplicate names on a single ballot shall count as only one vote.
 All elected persons take office at the first meeting in November.</li>

 <li>Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised (copyright 1970) will govern in any circumstances not
 covered by the Rules, Bylaws or Constitution of DAWN.</li>

 <li>DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS ON DISSOLUTION<br>
 In the event of dissolution of the organization, all remaining assets will be delivered to a
 tax-exempt organization to be chosen at the time of dissolution by the Board of Directors.</li>
