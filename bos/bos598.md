                              What Is Shamanism? 
    Since the term "shamanism" has been used in a number of ways during the
    discussions here I thought it might be helpful to present some basic
    information on shamanism as the inter-disicplinary subject that it has
    become since Mircea Eliade wrote _Shamanism_.

    The following is from the Foreward, which explains the approach that
    Eliade took to study Shamanism as a magico-religious phenomena, and
    which has been the foundation that shamanism as a spiritual tradition,
    as well as explaining how other academic disciplines approach the
    subject.

             ---------------------------------------

    Mircea Eliade
    _Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy_
    Princeton University, Bollingen Series LXXVI 1964

    Originally published in French as _Le Chamanisme et les techniques
    archaiques de l'extase_, Librairie Payot, Paris, 1951.  Revised and
    enlarged for the Bollinger edition.

    ISBN 0-691-01779-4 pbk   0-691-09827-1 hdbk


       To the best of our knowledge the present book is the first to cover
       the entire phenomenon of shamanism and at the same time to situate it
       in the general history of religions.  To say this is to imply its
       liability to imperfection and approximation and the risks that it
       takes.  Today the student has at his disposition a considerable
       quantity of documents for the various shamanisms--Siberian, North
       American, South American, Indonesian, Oceanian, and so on.  Then too,
       a number of works, important in their several ways have broken ground
    2591

       for the ethnological, sociological, and psychological study of
       shamanism (or rather, of a particular type of shamanism).  But with
    a
       few notable exceptions--we refer especially to the studies of Altaic
       shamanism by Holmberg (Harva)--the immense shamanic bibliography has
       neglected to interpret this extremely complex phenomenon in the
       framework of the history of religion.  It is as a historian of
       religions that we, in our turn, have attempted to approach,
       understand, and present shamanism.  Far be it from us to think of
       belittling the admirable studies undertaken from the viewpoints of
       psychology, sociology, or ethnology; we consider them indispensable
       to understanding the various aspects of shamanism.  But we believe
       that there is room for another approach--that which we have sought to
       implement in the following pages.

       The writer who approaches shamanism as a psychologist will be led to
       regard it as primarily the manifestation of a psyche in crisis or
       even in retrogression; he will not fail to compare it with certain
       aberrant psychic behavior patterns or to class it among mental
       diseases of the hysteroid or epileptoid type.

       We shall explain why we consider it inacceptable to assimilate
       shamanism to any kind of mental disease.  But one point remains (and
       it is an important one), to which the psychologist will always be
       justified in drawing attention: like any other religious vocation,
       the shamanic vocation is manifested by a crisis, a temporary
       derangement of the future shaman's spiritual equilibrium. All the
       observations and analyses that have been made on this point are
       particularly valuable  They show us, in actual process as it were,
       the repercussions, within th epsyche, of what we have called the
       "dialectic of hierophanies"--the radical separation between profane
       and sacred and the resulting splitting of the world.  To say this is
       to indicate all the importance that we attribute to such studies in
       religious psychology.

       The sociologist, for his part, is concerned with the social function
       of the shaman, the priest, the magician.  He will study prestige
       originating from magical powers, its role in the structure of
       society, the relations between religious and political leaders and so
       on.  A sociological analysis of the myths of the First Shaman will
       elicit revealing indications concerning the exceptional position of
       the earliest shamans in certain archaic societies.  The sociology of
       shamnism remains to be written, and it will be among the most
       important chapters in general sociology of religion.  The historian
       of religions must take all these studies and their conclusions into
       account.  Added to the psychological conditions brought out by the
       psychologist, the social ocnditions, in the broadest sense of the
       term, reinforce the element of human and historical concreteness in
       the documents that he is called upon to handle.

       The concreteness will be accented by the studies of the ehtnologist.
       It will be the task of ethnological monographs to situate the shaman
       in his cultural milieu.  There is danger of misunderstanding the true
       personality of a Chukchee shaman, for example, if one reads of his
       exploits without knowing anything about the life and traditions of
       the Chukchee.  Again, it will be for the ehtnologist to make
       exhaustive studies of the shaman's costume and drum, to describe the
       seances, to record texts and melodies, and so on.  By undertaking to
    2592

       establish the "history" of one or another constituent element of
       shamanism (the drum, for example, or the use of narcotics during
       seances), the ethnologist--joined when circumstances demand it, by a
       comparatist and historian--will suceed in showing the circulation of
       the particular motif in time and space; so far as possible, he will
       define its center of expansion and the stages and the chronology of
       its dissemination.  In short, the ethnolgist will also become a
       "historian," whether or not he adopts the Graebner-Schmidt-Koppers
       method of cultural cycles.  In any case, in addition to an admirable
       purely descriptive ethnographical literature, there are now available
       numerous works of historical ethnology: in the overwelming "gray
       mass" of cultural data stemming from the so-called "ahistorical"
       peoples, we now begin to see certain lines of force appearing; we
       begin to distinguish "history" where we were in the habit of finding
       only "Naturvolker," "primitives," or "savages."

       It is unnecessary to dwell here on the great services that historical
       ethnology has already rendered to the histroy of religions.  But we
       do not believe that it can take the place of the history of
       religions.  The latter's mission is to integrate the results of
       ethnology, psychology, and sociology.  Yet in doing so, it will not
       renounce its own method of investigation or the viewpoint that
       specifically defines it.  Cultural ethnology may have demonstrated
       the relation of shamanism to certain cultural cycles, for example, or
       the dissemination of one or another shamanic complex; yet its object
       is not to reveal the deeper meaning of all these religious phenomena,
       to illuminate their symbolism, and to place them in the general
       history of religions.  In the last analysis, it is for the historian
       of religions to synthesize all the studies of particular aspects of
       shamanism and to present a comprehensive view which shall be at once
       a morphology and a history of this complex religious phenomena.

                                                pg. xi-xiii



        Chapter One, General considerations.  REcruiting Methods.  Shamanism
        and Mystical Vocation.

        Since the beginning of the century, ehtnologists have fallen into
        the habit of using the terms, "shaman,"  "medicine man," "sorcer,"
        and "magician" interchangeably to designate certain individuals
        possessing magico-religious powers and found in all "primitive"
        societies.  By extension, the smae terminology has been applied in
        studying the religious history of "civilized" peoples, and there
        have been discussions, for example, of an Indian, an Iranian, a
        Germanic, a Chinese, and even a Babylonian "shamanism" with
        reference to the "primitive" elements attested in the corresponding
        religions.  For many reasons this confusion can only militate
        against any understanding of the shamanic phenomenon.  If the word
        "shaman" is taken to mean any magician, sorcerer, medicine man, or
        ecstatic found throughout the history of religions and religious
        ethnology, we arrive at a notion at once extremely complex and
        extremely vague; it seems, furthermore, to serve no purpose, for we
        already have the terms "magician" or "sorcerer" to express notions
        as unlike and as ill-defined as "primitive magic" or "primitive
        mysticism."
        We consider it advantageous to restrict the use of the words
    2593

        "shaman" and "shamanism" precisely to avoid misunderstandings and  
      to
        cast a clearer light on the history of "magic" and "sorcery."  For
        of course, the shaman is also a magician and medicine man; he is
        believed to cure, like all doctors, and to perform miracles of the
        fakir type, like all magicians, whether primitive or modern.  But
        beyond this, he is a psychopmp, and he may also be preist, mystic
        and powet.  In the dim, "confusionistic" mass of the religious life
        of archaic socieites considered as a whole, shamanism--taken in its
        strict and exact sense--already shows a structure of its own and
        implies a "history" that there is every reason to clarify.

        Shamanism in the strict sense is pre-eminently a religious
        phenomenon of Siberia and Central Asia.  The word comes to us,
        through the Russian, from the Tungusic _saman_.  In the other
        languages of Centeral and North Asia the corresponding terms are
        Yakut _ojuna_ (_oyuna_), Mongolian _buga_, _boga_ (_buge_, _bu_) and
        _udagan_ (cf. also Buryat _udayan_, Yukut _udoyan_: "shamaness")_,
        Turko-Tartar _kam_ (Altaic _kam_, _gam_, Mongolian _kami_, etc.)  It
        has been sought to explain the Tungusic term by the Pali _samana_,
        and we shall return to this possible etymology (which is part of the
        great problem of Indian influences on Siberian religions) in the
        last chapter of this book.  Throughout the immense area comprising
        Central and North Asia, the magico-religious life of society centers
        on teh shaman.  This, of course, does not mean that he is the one
        and only manipulator of the sacred, nor that religious activity is
        completely usurped by him.  IN many tribes the sacrificing priest
        coexists with the shaman, not to mention the fact that every head of
        a family is also the head of the domestic cult.  Nevertheless the
        shaman remains the dominating figure; for throught the whole region
        in which the ecstatic experience is considered the religious
        experience par excellence, the shaman, and he alone, is the great
        master of ecstasy.  A first definition of this complex phenomenon,
        and perhaps the least hazardous, will be: shamanism = _technique of
        ecstasy_.

                                            pgs 3-4


        Yet one observation must be made at the outset: the presence of a
        shamanistic complex in one region or another does not necessarily
        mean that the magico-religious life of the corresponding poeple is
        crystallized around shamanism.  This can ocur (as, for example, in
        certain parts of Indonesia), but it is not the most usual state of
        affairs.  Generally shamanism coexixsts with other forms of magic
        and religion.

        It is here that we see all the advantage of emplying the term
        "shamanism" in its strict and proper sense.  For, if we take the
        trouble to differentiate the shaman from other magicians and
        medicine men of primitive societies, the identification of shamanic
        complexes in one or another region immediately acquires definite
        significance.  Magic and magicians are to be foudn more or less all
        over the world, where as shamaism exhibits a particular magical
        specialty, on which we shall dwell at legth: "master over fire,"
        "magical flight," and so on.  By virtue of this fact, though the
        shaman is, among other things, a magician, not every magician can
        properly be termed a shaman.  The same distinction must be applied

        in regard to shamanic healing; ever medicine man is a healer, but
        the shaman employs a method that is his and his alone.  AS for the
        shamanic techniques of ecstasy, they do not exhaust all the
        varieties of ecstatic experience documented in the history of
        religions an dreligious ethnolgoy.  Hence any ecstatic cannot be
        considered a shaman; the shaman specializes in a trance during which
        his sould is believed to leave his body and ascend to the sky or
        descend to the underworld.

        A similar distinction is also necessary to define the shaman's
        relation to "spirits."  All through the primitive and modern worlds
        we find individuals who profess to maintain relations with
        "spirits," whether they are "possessed" by them or control them.
        SSEveral volumes would be needed for an adequate study of all the
        problems that arise in connection with the mere idea of "spirits"
        and of their possible relations with human beings; for a "spirit"
        can equally well be the sould of a dead person, a "nature spirit,"
    a
        mythical animal, and so on.  But the study of shamanism does not
        require going into all this; we need only define the shaman's
        relation to his helping spirits.  It will easily be seen wehrein a
        shaman differs from a "possessed" person, for example; the shaman
        controls his "spirits," in the sense that he, a human being, is able
        to communicate with the dead, "demons," and "nature spirits,"
        without thereby becoming their insturment.  To be sure, shamans are
        sometimes found to be "possessed," but these are exceptional cases
        for which there is a particular explanation.

        These few preliminary observations already indicate the course that
        we propose to follow in odrder to reach an adequate understanding of
        shamanism.  In view of the fact that this magico-religious
        phenomenon has had its most complete manifestation in North and
        Central Asia, we shall take the shaman of these regions as our
        typical example.  We are not unaware, and we shall endeavor to show,
        that Central and North Asian shamanism, at least in its present
        form, is not a primordial phenomenon that has a long "history."  But
        this Central Asian and Siberian shamanism has the advantage of
        presenting a structure in which elements that exist independently
        elsewhere in the world--i.e., special relations with "spirits,"
        ecstatic capacities permitting of magical flight, ascents to the
        sky, descents to the underworld, mastery over fire, etc.--are here
        already found integrated with a particular ideology and validating
        specific techniques.

                                            pgs. 5-6
