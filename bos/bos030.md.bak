# Tool Blessing Ritual

### A purification of objects for ritual use and their transformation into magical items.

(*The area is prepared by placing a quantity of each element in the
proper quarter, as well as preparing the altar in the usual way. If
available, a cauldron (empty) is placed in the center of the circle.
Candles are placed at each of the four corners and lit, progressing
deosil from the east. Salt and water are blessed, and the celebrants are
purified with them. A magic circle is cast, and watchtowers summoned.
The god is then drawn down as follows:  
The priest stands before the alter in the Osiris position, arms crossed
across chest and feet together. The Priestess kneels before him with
face and arms upraised.*)

drinks. The objects to be blessed are taken from the altar by the priest
and moved widdershins to the west quarter, and immersed in the water
there.*)

| **P&PS:** | Male and female, yin and yang, light and dark, action and stillness. Apart we are forever incomplete, but together we form one. In our joining we are blessed. In our union, the limitless energy of universe is released and captured here. |
| **P:**    | As I do will,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

(*The priest and priestess kiss, then release grasps. If the number and
size of the tools precludes them being held in one hand simultaneously,
the latter charging section should be repeated for each. The tools are
replaced on the altar. Cakes and wine are blessed and consumed and a
period of relaxation and rest follows. The watchtowers are then
dismissed and the circle opened.*)
