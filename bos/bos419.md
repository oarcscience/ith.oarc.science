                                                   HYMN TO ARTEMIS 

                                             by

                                        FRATER U.'.D.'.

                                    Artemis, my sibyl sibling
                                    huntress of the earthy skies,
                                    wayfaress in silver rippling -
                                    in your hands my power lies ...




                                  lies my dream and all my making
                                    muted might in liquid pose,
                                    lies my giving and my taking,
                                    caressing friends and smiting foes

                                    in your light and metal sheen,
                                    waxing, waning, touched, unseen,
                                    ever-moving curv.d bow
                                    ever-whirring arrow's flow
                                    to the core of mine own heart
                                    hitting mark, a gentle dart

                                    strikes my body, strikes my soul,
                                    fondles part and fondles whole
                                    towards my ever-pulsing spell:
                                    give me heaven, give me hell
                                    take from me what makes me sink
                                    with your sleight of hand and wink -

                                    Goddess of the nightly sweep,
                                    through the starlit mires seep,
                                    never solemn, yet possessed,
                                    by your mastery expressed,

                                    all your vision's harvest keeps ...
                                    all your vision's harvest keeps ...
                                                                                               1904
