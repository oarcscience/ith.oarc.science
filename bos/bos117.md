         OPENING THE CIRCLE 
          
          
          
         The High Priestess goes to each of the four directions in turn,  
         and draws a Banishing Pentacle, saying, 
          
          
              Guardians of the East (South, West, North), Powers of Air  
         (Fire, Water, Earth), we thank you 
              For joining in our circle 
              And we ask for your blessing 
              As you depart 
              May there be peace between us 
              Now and forever.  Blessed be. 
          
          
         She raises her athame to the sky and touches it to the earth, then 
         opens her arms and says, 
          
              The circle is open, but unbroken, 
              May the peace of the Goddess 
              Go in your hearts, 
              Merry meet, and merry part. 
              And merry meet again.  Blessed be. 


                                                                                 540
