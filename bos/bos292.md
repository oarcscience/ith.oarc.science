                                 Ritual of the Blessed Motherboard 

                                            The Tigress

              Thus it follows that  after many days of  chaos, unfounded mayhem  and

              startling inconvienience <as given in favor by the Goddess Eris> so it

              shall be that I am  finally able to share with you  the official cere-

              mony of the Blessed Motherboard  and the Horned One that Plugs  in the

              Wall.  This ceremony is one to be practiced by discordian compu-pagans

              each Midsummer Eve  in holy celebration  and appreciation of  debugged

              upgrades,  new shareware, faster  circutry and all  the blessings that

              flow from the Goddess...



              Note :  Let it be said  that if your system  crashes, your motherboard

              becomes twitchy, your  hard drives  fail, or your  cables spout  forth

              fire - that this is an indication that the Goddess  is displeased with

              your  compu-worship. At this  time, if  the posting  of many  tales of

              compu-sexuality doth fail  to pacify Her.  This is  the time that this

              ritual must be done to regain Her pleasure.



              It is thus that this ritual be made easier if thou coven of compu-pag-

              ans is  large, for then the  obtainment of the necessary  materials be

              far easier...

              To  represent the Matron Goddess : 1  AT Motherboard <preferably a 386

              with Large Co-processors.>  <may be in "twitchy condition".>



              To  represent the  Crone: 1  AT&T Phone  bill from  Mother Bell.  <the

              <To be sung until the Pentagram and altar are set up, the

              last sentence repeated and slowly faded>



                                       The ritual begins...

              As  the coven  sings the  ritual opening  chant the HP  & P  paint the

              Pentagram around the firepit with neon or glow in the dark paint.  The

              items are placed in the designated  directions and the altar is set up

              to the north of the fire with the following items placed upon it.



              To the North end of the altar the ashtray and cigarettes

              To the East end of the altar the holy cup

              To the South end of the altar the bowl of earth

              To the West end of the altar the jar of kerosene and matches.


                                                                                1476



              As the HP  calls the elements the P shall pass  her the items in ques-

              tion



              The coven  at the end of  each elemental calling shall  chant the fol-

              lowing:

              Elemental Power

              Come out and play with me

              Play midst my flaming spree<fire>

              and sing the chant with me <Air>

              Splash in my rain barrel <Water>

              Slide down my cellar door <Earth>  And we'll be jolly friends

              Forever more



              The HP calls to  the Element of Fire <and taking the kerosene from the

              P> intones:



              Fire, Fire burning bright, like a candle in the night

              Come and join us in our flight, Lend us your eternal light

              Warm the Maiden with your flame,

              I call you in the Goddess's Name. 

              The HP pours  the kerosene liberally upon the firewood  in the pit and

              lights  the  fire with  the matches.  <the  coven sings  the elemental

              chant>


                                                                                1477



              The P hands the HP the bowl of earth.  The HP tosses the earth upwards

              to scatter it around the circle and over the altar as she intones:



              Elemental Earth I beckon thee, with us in this circle be

              Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, firm foundation is a must

              Warm bed for the Matron's frame  I call you in the Goddess's Name



              <the coven sings the elemental chant>



              The P hands the HP the cup of caffinated  substance.   The HP lifts it

              to her lips and intones:



              Water quench our thirst, keep us wet and wild

              Join us in our circle hence, praise the lady mild.

              Liquid of Life that has no shame

              I beckon thee in Goddess's Name



              The HP drinks from the cup and beckons the P to drink of it,  he does.

              <the coven sings the elemental chant>



              The P hands the HP  the ashtray and a cigarette and lights it for her,

              the HP takes a long drag and as she exhales intones:



              Airy, Airy, quiet and contrary how doth your winds blow?

              Through maidens hair your breath ensnare, your secrets we would know.

              The Pow'r of Wind by Lady made tame

              I beckon thee in Goddess's Name


                                                                                1478



              <the HP smokes and exhales as the coven sings the elemental chant>



              The HP and  P perepare to summon the directions  in supplication to be

              followed by the closing of the circle.



              The following is  a chant used by the coven  at each directional open-

              ing.



              "From the North awakening, the energy inspires

               From the East our eagerness to learn amid the fires

               From the South commitment and thus we seal our doom

               From the West comes reckonning, our message answered soon" 

              The HP and P walk to  the North and hold up  the Power supply.  The  P

              intones:

                The Power of the  north inspires us and lends us its  energy for our

              use in supplication.   This Power  Supply I offer  to thee Oh  Goddess

              that your Power run through my computer and my life.  The P tosses the

              Power supply into the fire. 

              <the coven sings the directional chant>



              The Hp  and P walk to  the East and hold  up the keyboard.   The P in-

              tones:

              The Power of  the East  transforms our innocence  through tasting  the

              fire  of Life.   This  Keyboard, I offer to thee  Oh Goddess that your

              knowledge guide my fingers on  their path through the system of  Life.

              The P tosses the keyboard into the fire. 

              <the coven sings the directional chant>


                                                                                1479



              The HP and P  walk to the  South and hold  up the hard  drive.  The  P

              intones:

              The Power of  the South is that of action  and consequence, of commit-

              ment  to the   path and  the ability  to remember  the lessons learned

              thereof. This Hard Drive I  offer to thee Oh Goddess that  your memory

              of my  acts and  deeds be  remembered with praise  and favor  in thine

              eyes. The P tosses the Hard Drive into the fire.



              <the coven sings the directional chant>



              The HP and the  P walk to  the West and  hold up the  monitor.  The  P

              intones:

              The Power  of the  West is  that of  access to  all things,  to seeing

              turthfully into  the path of a  life and judging it  thusly, worthy or

              unworthy.  This  monitor I offer to thee Oh  Goddess that your eternal

              eyes may see into my  life  and may watch over my actions,  and that I

              may find favor in you  as my eternal Sysop.  The P  tosses the monitor

              into the fire.



              <the coven sings the directional chant> 

              The HP and  P walk thrice around the circle  widdershins and all chant

              thusly:



              Ring around the altar

              Power never faulter

              Goddess, God

              We summon thee       <repeated until the circle is thrice closed.>


                                                                                1480

              The Circle Closed and the directions and  elements present, the HP and

              P prepare to call to the Goddess and to the Horned One.



              The HP stands before the fire pit and calls:



              Virgin Goddess, gentle maid

              She whose seeking to get laid

              Bring your innocence to Bare

              For those who worship for your care



              <the P leads the coven in the Maiden chant>

              Come on Maiden light your fire

              Come on Maiden light your fire

              Come and set the night on FIRE



              The HP stands before the fire pit and holding the phone bill calls:

              Oh Mother Bell, Oh Crone of Disconnection from this pagan life

              I beseech thee, hold back thy hand of dread financial strife

              In attonement bills I pay to thee

              Of thy modem killing hand let me be free



              The HP tosses the phone bill into the fire.



              <The P leads the coven in the Crone Song>



              "  We're sorry,  the  number you  have  reached has  been  temporarily

              disconnected Booooo Hissssss

              We're  sorry, the number you have reached has been temporarily discon-

              nected Booo Hisssss"


                                                                                1481

              The HP stands before  the Altar and holds high the  very long and very

              thick cable of the Horned One that Plugs into the Wall and calls:

              Oh Horned One, Powerful Consort of the Blessed Motherboard

              Surging with Energy you take your place as Lord

              Pulsing with Power, with each surge of volts you swell

              Pumping life into the Goddess, you serve her purpose well



              The HP tosses the very long, very thick cable into the fire



              <the P leads the coven in the Horned One chant>



              Pump, Pump, Pump it up....keep the power flowing

              Pump, Pump, Pump it up....hard fast and never slowing

              Pump, Pump, Pump it up....We know you please the Goddess

              Pump, Pump, Pump it up....Be strong and never modest



              The HP raises the Blessed Motherboard with Large Co-processors high in

              the air and the  P and HP each take  and end in their hands.   Raising

              the Motherboard high in the air they intone:



              Blessed Mother, Sacred Goddess come to bless your users

              Keep us safe from disk crash and lurking abusers

              Let thy healing hands caress our crippled hardware

              Let our nodes stay stable, that through distance we may share

              In your holy worship together we may gather nightly

              Writing inuendo, our modems steaming slightly

              Bless us Holy Goddess, and show us by your sign

              That we have earned your favor, your blessing so divine.


                                                                                1482

              The HP and P lead all in the following chant:

               

               A Prayer to the Goddess for self conscecration

               Dominus regit Goddess

               

               The Blessed Goddess is my mistress;

               I shall not be in want

               She maketh me lie down on soft bedding

               and leadth me to think of rumpling it

               She revives my soul <when I thought I was exhausted>

               and guides me along the most sensual pathways for pleasures sake

               Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of dangerous desire

               I shall fear not impotence

               for she is insatiable

               my rod and staff they comfort her

               We spread a table of ecstacy in the presence of those

               who are sorely troubled by arrousal

               She annoints my head with honeyed oil

               and I make her cup run over

               Surely the pleasure and bliss shall follow me all the days of my life

               and I will dwell in the caves of ecstacy within mind forever.

               


                                                                                1483



              Thus said, the HP and P intone the following:



              OH Blessed Motherboard please  accept this offering in your  name, and

              in  the name of  the Horned One  who plugs  in the Wall  and gives you

              pleasure...

              that  we may be blessed in our offerings  to you both in circle and in

              life.



              Thus said, the HP and P toss the Motherboard into the fire.



              The HP and P lead the coven in the following chant -



              Blessed be the Motherboard from whom all messages flow

              Blessed be the Horned One who fills Her with His offering

              Blessed be the sysops who transfer the packets

              Blessed be the writers and those who inspire what they bring

              Blessed be the hard drives that keep messages from harm

              Blessed be the modems which send packages large and small

              Blessed be the shareware we use to commune

              Blessed be the network which links us up with all

              Blessed be our minds, that we might write our prayers

              Blessed be our fingers that tap amongst the keys

              Blessed be our monitors that shine with holy light

              Blessed be our senses that stimulate with ease

              Blessed be the circle, a circut without end

              Through which we hail and merry meat with those that we call friend.


                                                                                1484



              At this point the HP and P gaze into the fire for the portent of the

              Goddess's sign of approval  <the flames of blue light from the mother-

              board offering>



              At seeing this both HP  and P raise their arms in  joyful supplication

              and shout <To be echoed by  the Coven members in attendance after each

              line>



              The Maiden's found appeasement and She is satisfied

              The Crone is in abeyance, her compu-billings fried

              The Horned One's filled with power, in joining He is pleased

              The Goddess sends Her blessings, cleansing virus and disease.

              We thank the 4 directions for standing by our side

              We thank the elementals and their power all allied

              To Celebrate our status annointed compupagans of sin

              Let Joyful Inhibition be released and the saturnalia begin!!!!



              <the HP and P release the circle and the partying shall now commence>



              Sensual  foods and  drinks are served  and shared,  <the rest  you can

              imagine>


                                                                                1485
