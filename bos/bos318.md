                                          Wiccan History 
                   Wicca is a relatively modern attempt (approximately 50 years old)
              at  reviving and  reconstructing  the old  pre-Christian religions  of
              Europe.   In a mythopoetic sense  it is many centuries  old.  However,
              the Witch of 200 years ago would not recognize what  is called "witch-
              craft"  today.  Modern Wicca may have some of its roots in some of the
              local  folk-magic and "family witchcraft" of mid 20th Century England.
              It does  have traceable roots  in the Golden  Dawn magical society  of
              late 19th  century England, some  of Aleister Crowley's  magickal work
              and some  Ceremonial Magic dating  back to  Elizabethan times.   For a
              modern  history of  English  Wicca,  the  reader can  most  profitably
              consult the works of Janet and Stuart Farrar and Doreen Valiente.  

              PREHISTORY 
                   Up  until recently, the earliest known  remnants of human society
              that give us  any clues to the spiritual dimension  of prehistoric man
              are those  belonging to  the Gravettian-Aurignacian cultures  of 2500-
              1500 B.C.E.  This is called the Upper Paleolithic Period.  Though most
              of  the sites  so far  discovered have  been found  in Europe,  a very
              important site in  Anatolia (modern Turkey) has also been found and is
              the  (so far)  the first  or oldest  City of  Catal Huyuk  (pronounced
              chatal Hoo-Yook),they  form a conjectural foundation  for the religion
              of  the goddess as it  emerged in the later  Neolithic Age of the Near
              East.    There  have been numerous  studies of these  Paleolithic cul-
              tures, including extensive explorations of the sites occupied by these
              peoples,  including the apparent rites  connected with the disposal of
              their dead.

                   The earliest remains of ancient civilization indicating some form
              of Goddess  worship were in the  caves in Lascaux, France.   Here, the
              first and earliest non-anthropomorphic divine figures were  symbolized
              by  the horse  for female Divinity  and the  Bison as  the male divine
              influence.   This  portion of  the cave  was painted  in approximately
              17,000  B.C.E. and sealed  approximately 10,000 B.C.E.   The anthropo-
              morphic Goddess figures appear sometime approximately 7,000 B.C.E. The
              earliest remains in  Catal Huyuk  have been reliably  carbon dated  to
              6,500  B.C. and show some interesting parallels  in that the horse was
              replaced with an  anthropomorphic goddess  and the Bison  (an ice  age
              animal)  has been replaced with  the aurochs bull,  ancestor of modern
              cattle.  The anthropomorphic Goddess is an Earth Mother and the nearby
              volcanoes (then active) were considered her breasts.1

                              One major conjecture has been that  the concept of the creator of
              all human life may have been formulated by the clan's  image of women.
              The  reasoning behind this conjecture lies in the observations in this
              century  of the few remaining Paleolithic type cultures.  These Paleo-
              lithic  cultures tend to be woman centered  since it is from the women
              that  babies come  and  the women  are  absolutely essential  for  the
              continuation of the tribe or clan.  Current information also indicates
              that it is also probable that the mother was regarded  as the sole (or
              at least  primary) parent of children in  this culture, and that there
              was a  definite pattern of ancestor worship.  It is also very probable
              that ancestry was matrilineal.


                                                                                1547
              

                   The most tangible  evidence that these very  ancient cultures and
              their predecessors worshipped a goddess is the  numerous sculptures of
              women  found throughout  most of Europe  and the  Near east.   Some of
              these sculptures  date  as  far back as  25,000 B.C.E.!   Small female
              figurines, made of stone, bone and clay (most seemingly pregnant) have
              been found throughout  the widespread Gravettian-Aurignacian  sites as
              far apart as Spain,  France, Germany, Austria, and Russia  spanning an
              apparent period of  at least 10,000  years.  Erich  Neumnann, in  "The
              Great Mother" (p.95) says-  "Of the Stone Age sculptures  known to us,
              there are fifty-five female figures and  only five male figures.   The
              male figures, of youths, are atypical and poorly executed, hence it is
              certain that they had no significance for the cult.  This fits in with
              the secondary character of  the male godhead, who appeared  only later
              in  the history  of religions  and  derived his  divine rank  from his
              mother, the Goddess."

                   Johannes  Maringer, in  his book  the  "Gods of  Prehistoric Man"
              says-  "it appears highly probable then that the female figurines were
              idols of a Great Mother cult, practiced by the non-nomadic Aurignacian
              mammoth hunters  who inhabited  the immense Eurasian  territories that
              extended from Southern   France to  Lake Baikal in  Siberia."  It  was
              from the Lake Baikal area in  Siberia that tribes are believed to have
              migrated across the  Bering land  bridge to North  America about  this
              time period, and formed the  nucleus of what was to become the race of
              North American Indians.  In some primitive societies known to history,
              the male role in procreation was not known.  Intercourse and pregnancy
              both begin with puberty, and there was no evident reason to regard one
              as the  cause of the other.  Women were  believed to conceive from the
              light of the moon or from ancestral spirits.

                   Neolithic  cultures have left a  bit more evidence  for study and
              the images are a bit clearer and less speculative.   One good instance
              of this  is the stone age  painting of a priestess  officiating over a
              group of worshippers along with a male wearing a horned headdress.  An
              interesting point here  is that  the priestess pictured  is wearing  a
              garter and wielding a  ceremonial dagger, much  like the ones used  in
              modern witchcraft.  Of course much  has been made of this, including a
              lot of unfounded speculations on  the "ancient connections" of  modern
              witchcraft, but that is a topic beyond the scope of  the present work.
              The beginnings  of Roman religion are  sure to have been  based on the
              Etruscan  culture.  Ancestor worship was the earliest form of religion
              in Rome.   Another interesting  fact relating  to ancient  Matrilineal
              forms influencing  present society is  reflected in the  Jewish custom
              current  today that  membership  comes from  the  mother's side  of  a
              marriage.

                   The above mentioned goddess images, some as old as 7000 BC, offer
              silent testimony to the most ancient worship of a great goddess in the
              land that is most  often remembered today as  the homeland of  Judaism
              and  Christianity.  In exploring  the influence and  importance of the
              worship of  the Goddess in Canaan  in biblical times, we  find that as
              Ashtoreth, Asherah  (perhaps  the  origin  of the  tribe  of  Asher?),
              Astarte,  Attoret, Anath,  or simply  as Elat or  Baalat, she  was the
              principal deity of such  great Canaanite cities as Tyre,  Sidon, Asca-
              lon, Beth Anath, Aphaca, Byblos, and Ashtoreth Karnaim.   


                                                                                1548
              


                   In Egypt, the Hebrews had known the worship of the Goddess as    
                Isis or Hathor. For four generations they had been living  in a land
              where women held a very high status and the matrilineal descent system
              continued to function at most periods.  

                   Judging  from the number of Hebrews who emerged from Egypt in    
              the Exodus,  as compared with the  family of the twelve  sons who sup-
              posedly  entered it four generations  earlier, it seems  likely that a
              great  number of those Hebrews  known as Israelites  may actually have
              been Egyptians, Canaanites, Semitic nomads and other Goddess-worshipp-
              ing  peoples who had joined together in Egypt.  Archaeological records
              and artifacts reveal that the religion of the Goddess still flourished
              in many of the cities of Canaan long after the Hebrews invaded.

                   What are some of the modern day applications of this long history
              of Goddess worship?  For  an answer to this,  let's look at an  encap-
              sulation of the "herstory" of  the legend of the Universal Goddess  as
              taught to the  new entrants to  the Faerie Tradition  in 20th  Century
              America.

                   According  to the  legends of  the Faerie, Witchcraft  and magick
              began more than 35 thousand years ago, when the last ice age in europe
              began and small  bands of  nomadic hunters  followed the  free-running
              reindeer and bison herds.  They were armed with but primitive  weapons
              ( Stone Age, remember?), and  had to lure or chase the animals  over a
              cliff or into a  pit to kill and eat them.   As Starhawk says,"...some
              among the clans were gifted, could "call" the herds to a cliff side or
              a pit, where a  few beasts,in willing sacrifice, would  let themselves
              be trapped."

                   As  the  last ice  age retreated  the  tribes of  nomadic hunters
              worshipped the Goddess of the Wild Things and Fertility and the God of
              the Hunt.Semipermanent homes  were set up in  caves carved out by  the
              glaciers.  Shamans and  Shamanka conducted rites within hard  to reach
              portions of  the caves,  which  were painted with scenes  of the hunt,
              magical symbols and the tribes totem animals.  

                   The   transition  from  Hunter-Gatherers  to  agriculturists  was
              reflected in the change of the "Lady of the Wild Things and Fertility"
              to  the "Barley Mother" and the "God of  the Hunt" to the "Lord of the
              Grain".   The importance  of the phases  of the  moon and the  sun was
              reflected  in the  rituals  that evolved  around sowing,  reaping, and
              letting out to pasture.  

                   Villages  grew into  towns and  cities and  society changed  from
              tribal to  communal to  urban.  Paintings  on the  plastered walls  of
              shrines depicted  the Goddess giving birth  to the Divine  Child - Her
              son,  consort and  seed.   The  Divine Child  was expected  to take  a
              special interest in  the city dwellers, just as His  Mother and Father
              had taken  an interest in the  people who lived away  from the cities.
              Mathematics, astronomy, poetry, music, medicine, and the understanding
              of  the workings of  the human mind,  developed side by  side with the
              lore of the deeper mysteries.  


                                                                                1549
              


                   Far to the east, nomadic tribes devoted themselves to the arts of
              war and conquest.  Wave after wave of invasion swept  over Europe from
              the  Bronze Age  onward.  Warrior  gods drove the  Goddess' people out
              from the fertile  lowlands and  the fine temples,  into the hills  and
              high mountains,  where they became  known as  the Sidhe, the  Picts or
              Pixies, and the  Fair Folk or the Fairies.   The mythological cycle of
              Goddess and Consort, Mother and Child, which had held sway  for 30,000
              years  was changed to conform to the values of the conquering patriar-
              chies.  

                   In  Canaan,  Yahweh fought  a bloody  battle  to ensure  that his
              followers had  "no other  gods before  me."  The  Goddess was  given a
              masculine name and assigned  the role of a false god.   Along with the
              suppression  of the  Goddess, women lost  most of the  rights they had
              previously enjoyed.  

                   In Greece, the Goddess in Her many aspects,  was "married" to the
              new gods  resulting in  the  Olympic Pantheon.   The  Titans, who  the
              Olympians  displaced were more in touch with the primal aspects of the
              Goddess.  

                   The  victorious Celts in Gaul and the British Isles, adopted many
              features  of the Old Religion  and incorporated them  into the Druidic
              Mysteries.  The Faerie, breeding cattle in the stony hills and  living
              in turf-covered round huts  preserved the Craft.  They  celebrated the
              eight feasts of the Wheel of the Year with wild  processions on horse-
              back,  singing and chanting along the way and lighting ritual bonfires
              on the  mountaintops.  It was  said that the invaders  often joined in
              the revels and  many rural  families, along with  some royalty,  could
              claim  to have Faerie blood.  The College of the Druids and the Poetic
              Colleges of  Ireland and Wales were said to have preserved many of the
              old mysteries. ***

                   In  the late 1400's  the Catholic Church  attempted to obliterate
              its competitors, and the followers of the Old Religion were forced  to
              "go underground."   They broke up into small groups called Covens and,
              isolated from  each other,  formed what  would later  be known as  the
              Family  Traditions.  Inevitably, parts  of the Craft were forgotten or
              lost and what survives today is fragmentary.  

                   After nearly five centuries  of persecution and terror,  came the
              Age of Disbelief.   Memory of the True Craft  had faded as non-members
              who could     remember how they once had met openly died and those who
              came after  never knew of  them.  All that  was left were  the hideous
              stereotypes  which were     ludicrous, laughable or just plain tragic.
              With  the repeal of  the last Witchcraft  Act in England  in 1954, the
              Craft started  to re-emerge as an  alternative to a  world that viewed
              the planet as a resource to be exploited.   


                                                                                1550
              


                   Janet and  Stewart  Farrar, in  the introduction  to The  Witches
              Goddess  say of the  modern re-emergence of  the Goddess "  ..may well
              prove to be one of the most significant spiritual, psychic and psycho-
              logical developments of our lifetime".  They have since done a wonder-
              ful job of presenting an overview of the ascendancy and history of the
              expression  of the masculine  principle of deity as  e pressed by Male
              God-forms and  Gods with their  book The  Witches' God.   What do  the
              Farrars consider  this "masculine principle" to  be? "...it represents
              the linear-logical,analyzing, fertilizing aspect, with its emphasis on
              Ego-consciousness  and  individuality,  while  the  feminine principle
              represents the cyclical-intuitive, synthesizing, formative, nourishing
              aspect,  with  its emphasis  on the  riches  of the  unconscious, both
              Personal and Collective, and on relatedness."

                   As mankind  started to develop  his cultures  in directions  that
              were more male  dependent in the nature of the  cultures, the emphasis
              in  religion shifted  to  become more  male  god than  female  goddess
              oriented.   As  this  happened, the  Goddess(es)  lost ground  to  the
              God(s). At first,  the female  aspect merely became  secondary to  the
              male, but  eventually the  male took over  and dominated to  the total
              exclusion of the female, particularly in western society as we know it
              today. "The first major  god-form to claim a monopoly of  divinity was
              the  Hebrew Yahweh, from which in  due course sprang the Christian and
              Moslem forms."   "Dr. Raphael Patai,  in his books Man  and Temple and
              The Hebrew  Goddess  shows that  the  Goddess Asherah  was  worshipped
              alongside Yahweh as his wife and sister in the Temple at Jerusalem for
              240 of  the 360 years  the temple complex  existed, and her  image was
              publicly displayed there."   There  is also evidence  that the  Jewish
              community at  elephantine in egypt acknowledged   two goddess-wives of
              Yahweh, and  also there still remains in Ezekiel (xxiii)a metaphorical
              reference to a  pair of wives, where Yahweh condemns the "whoredom" of
              two sisters who "became mine and bore me sons and daughters".  


                                                                                1551
