              The song is sung to the tune of Amazing Grace. Enjoy! 
                 
              Verna Knapp  
                 
                 
                      Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth  
                      that bore a witch like me!  
                      I once was burned, now I survive,  
                      was hung and now I sing.  
                 
                      T'was grace that drew down the moon  
                      and grace that raised the seas.  
                      The magic in the people's will  
                      will set our Mother free.  
                 
                      We face the East and breathe the winds  
                      that move across this earth.  
                      From gentle breeze to hurricane  
                      our breath will bring forth the change.  
                 
                      Turn towards the South and feel the fire  
                      that burns in you and me.  
                      The spirit's flame will rise again  
                      and burn eternally. 
                 
                      We greet the West, our souls awash  
                      in tides of primal birth.  
                      Our tears and blood, our pain and love  
                      will cleanse and heal the earth.  
                 
                      Reach into the North and know your roots  
                      down deep ancestral caves.  
                      We find the wisdom of the Crone,  
                      Of circles we are made.  
                 
                      Amazing earth, enduring life,  
                      from death into rebirth.  
                      T'is earth I am and earth I love  
                      and earth I'll always be.  
                 
                      Amazing grace, how sweet the Earth  
                      that bore witches like we.  
                      We once were burned, now we survive,  
                      were hung and now we sing.  
                 
                      Goddess bless, so mote it be,  
                      Our magic spirals on. 
                      Merry meet and merry part 
                      and merry meet again. 


                                                                                 960
