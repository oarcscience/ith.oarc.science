                                   PR Flyer 
                                   By Raven

    This may answer some of the questions being asked about Wicca on
    PODSNet. If you print it up nice, it may also help in answering
    questions OFF PODSNet.

    Mind you, it is only ONE possible rendition; opinions are GUARANTEED to
    vary.

    About three years ago, I did a little PR flyer to hand out when Wiccans
    were doing public events (for instance, Beltane Maypole dancing in the
    local park) and curious passersby would ask just what the heck was going
    on.  If you like the idea, use it -- and feel free to adapt it as
    needed, for your own group.

                   What You Wanted to Know about Witches *

                        * (but were afraid to ask)

    Q.  Do you worship the Devil (Satan)?

    A.  No, for three reasons.

        First, we don't venerate evil in any form:  our chosen religion is
        a celebration and affirmation of life and living things, as opposed
        to their destruction or harm.  As we believe that good or evil done
        will return upon the doer, this does not encourage doing evil.

        Second, Satan is a figure in Judeo-Christian beliefs -- originally
        not even an opponent of Yahweh, but more like his prosecuting
        attorney (as in the Book of Job).  Those who do worship Satan
        actually accept the later Christian theology, with Satan as
        Yahweh's opponent, but choose to support Satan's side of the
        battle.  We are not Christians or Satanists, and do not accept
        their theology or worldview, so we would no more worship Satan
        than, for instance, Christians would worship the Aztec God
        Quetzalcoatl; he simply has no place in our beliefs.  (We prefer
        the figure of Pan, who does have horns but is a much nicer fellow.)

        Third, we think history shows that, if you invest belief and
        emotion in any idea or thought-form, you give it strength and power
        in your own life -- it becomes more real TO YOU.  We have no wish
        to invite hostile entities into our lives and give them such power
        over us, which is why we don't venerate any form we consider evil.
        That's also why we're shocked to see how much energy some
        Christians invest in Satan.

    Q.  Then why do I hear those things about you?

    A.  "Devil-worship", baby-killing, cannibalism and all that?  These
        are typical accusations made by one religion against another.
        The Syrians accused the Jews of ritual murders long before Christ;
        then the Romans accused the Christians (who at least claimed to be
        eating someone's body and blood every week); then the Christians
    3020

        accused the Jews and Muslims and every other religion; today
        different Christian denominations even accuse each other.  Making
        wild accusations not only sells newspapers, and books, and movies;
        it helps drum up support for the Religion Of Your Choice.  This is
        a cynical use of hate, fear, and ignorance, but as long as it works,
        it will be used. (And there will always be psychotics willing to
        live up to the image -- then claim "the Devil made me do it.")


    Q.  If not Christian theology, what do you believe in?

    A.  Life.  We see the entire Universe, all matter and energy, as
        bursting with life, loving its own living parts -- including us --
        and gathered in one eternal dance.  We try to catch the tune and
        dance to the beat.

        Sometimes we call the leading dancers Light and Dark, or Sun and
        Moon, or the Lord and the Lady, Cernunnos and Ceridwen, Pan and
        Diana, or by other names.  These represent the duality in all
        things -- male and female, yang and yin -- neither side of which
        can be denied or ignored, even within ourselves.

        (We hope this helps us avoid the error that some worshippers of a
        single deity have made, such as thinking that "since God is all
        good and God is male, therefore anything female or feminine is
        evil.")

        Our feeling about the Gods is that they are teachers, family
        members, and fellow dancers:  not some untouchable abstraction
        infinitely distant, but an intimate part of our own lives.  Our
        feeling about other religions is that they, too, are part of the
        universal dance: not enemies, but fellow strugglers seeking as we
        do, to live and learn to keep time with the music.


    Q.  What is this ceremony you're doing?

    A.  It depends on the moment.  You may be watching a circle dance, or a
    Maypole dance, or a feast of "cakes and ale", or just a group hug.
    (We like to have fun.)  Possibly, since you were handed this, you're
    watching us "cast a circle".  That's one of our basic religious
    ceremonies.

    When we "cast a circle", we mark off a space as dedicated and protected
    for our use, rather like Christians consecrating a church.  (The
    difference is, we don't need a building, and we let the space go back to
    normal after we've used it.)  Within this circle, we ask for the
    protection of guardians -- call them the four elements of Air, Earth,
    Fire, and Water, or the four archangels Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and
    Uriel -- again, the names may vary.  Then we invite the Lord and the
    Lady to be with us for a time.  We have a nice visit, a little snack of
    cookies and wine (or fruit juice), and then everyone goes home.  It's
    very friendly.

    Along the way, sometimes we ask for help with our problems, such as
    healing an injury or illness; if you believe in the power of prayer,
    it's the same sort of thing -- but we try to put our own energies into
    the task, rather than asking someone else to do all the work.

    Q.  How will what you are doing affect me?

    A.  If you're not participating, then probably no more than any other
    religious service you watch from outside.  If you're shocked by other
    religions, you might choose to be shocked by ours.  (Ours is just out
    where you can see it, instead of hidden by walls.)  Or you might choose
    to accept our part of the universal dance as valid if different from
    your own.  You might even choose to participate -- and people of good
    will are generally welcome among us.

    Even if you do participate, there's no reason to take any effect from
    our services that you don't choose to accept.  Since -- for our own
    sakes -- we ask for nice things to happen, the biggest possible results
    involve no danger.  If we ask for more harmony in the world, and your
    life becomes more harmonious, then you benefit from the same general
    effect as if a church's prayer for world peace had worked. (After that,
    if you don't like harmony, you could always work to make your own life
    more discordant; whatever suits you.)


    Q.  Do all Witches practice the same way you do?

    A.  There are about as many "denominations" of Witches as there are of
    Christians, and since no-one is forced to keep One True Orthodox Way,
    even a single group may do things differently from time to time.  The
    two mottoes that apply here are "If it works, use it" -- and "AN IT HARM
    NONE, do as you will."


    Q.  How can I find out more about you?

    A.  Ask one of us.  We're easy to talk with.  Or read some books.  Good
    books include Vivianne Crowley's WICCA: the Old Religion in the New Age,
    Margot Adler's Drawing Down the Moon, Starhawk's The Spiral Dance, and
    Raymond Buckland's Complete Guide to Witchcraft.

    There's also a lot of shocking nonsense and pulp fiction out there
    -- notably in movies, paperback thrillers, and the sort of newspapers
    sold at supermarket cash registers; we can only ask you to take anything
    you find there with a skeptical pinch of salt.
