                                               Today the Moon is There 

                                                      Hugh Read



                  In that mighty, non-human Power Place
                  Of mind that Is Not
                  Lord of the Galaxy
                  Can you hear my cry

                  For fulfilment of my broken being
                  Faulted, cracked, torn
                  From that first painfilled day
                  Of savage, late birth

                  Send to me streamers of healing power
                  That will make me new
                  Of more eternal stuff
                  Than this failed human

                  Being is moulded from...fill in the sad cracks
                  Seal the aweful breaks
                  Smooth and fill the fissures
                  With eternity

                  That I may serve humanity wisely
                  With pleasure and joy
                  Being more than human
                  Helping others grow

                  Into the same places of dark power



                That are full of light
                  That I hunger to touch
                  And to feed upon

                  Touch me now, this day
                  Lord of the Galaxy
                  Put me on thy Way
                  Lord of the Galaxy
                  Put me on my Way
                                                                                               1905
