                            Divine Circle of The Sacred Grove ***SCAM**
                                Office of the Preceptor
                    P.O. Box 66311, Seattle, WA, U.S.A. 98166

              THE FOLLOWING IS FOR PUBLICATION;

              To the Pagan Community:
                    In July of 1991, ADF sent out a Druid Alert about an
              organization called the Divine Circle of the Sacred Grove. ADF
              began investigating this group because they were using ADF
              letterhead, membership forms, advertising copy, and other
              materials with their names substituted for ours. Prior to raising
              any public issues, ADF's Preceptor, Domi O'Brien called the group
              and talked to their Scribe, Kal Mannis. Mr. Mannis told her that
              if she had questions, she could come to a public meeting on July
              2nd, 1991, in Seattle, and ask them there.
                    Domi, Bwca, Erynn and members of 4 other Traditions and
              organizations attended their talk. We noted with increasing
              amazement their claims and their views of the interrelationship
              of Druidism and Wicca, and after they mentioned Isaac Bonewits,
              Domi challenged some of their staements, as the ADF Preceptor.
              The DCSG literature going back to 1988 was examined, along with
              other staements which have been made to us or others. Janette
              Laverna Garcia a/k/a Gordon a/k/a Copeland, born 2/9/1942,
              Houston TX,; Richard Norman Ian Garcia a/k/a Gordon a/k/a
              Copeland, born 8/12/1940, Prescott, AZ; Jerry Eugene Everett
              Wayne Reamer a/k/a Prophet, born 8/12/1948, Pottstown, PA; Kalman
              Mannis, Nancy Brown, Brenda Matarazzo, David Trippey, Donovan
              Cotton; Dr. Jay Tibbles, Mary Ernst, and others affiliated with
              their group were examined for legitamate mundane and magickal
              credentials. The only person whose credentials we were able to
              verify was Dr. Jay Tibbles.
                    Janette's claims, as given in her various peices of
              literature, and as made to us, or to persons whose credentials we
              were able to verify, include: Hereditary Witch and Druid; Pipe
              Carrier for the Lumbee, the Sioux, the Cherokee, and the Chumash;
              member of the MotherGrove and Board of Directors of the ADF, as
              well as group marriage to the entire ADF Board of Directors;
              membership and 3rd Circle status in the British Circle of the
              Universal Bond; training by Ross Nichols, 3rd Degree Celtic and
              Egyptian Priestess; 3rd Degree Alexandrian Priestess, New York,
              1973; 3rd Degree Gardinarian Priestess, New York, 1965;
              incorporation of her organization in 14 states; training by
              Rhuddlwm Gawr, and training by Grandmaster Eli (Barney Taylor, of
              the Druidic Craft of the Wise), marriage to Eli, as well as being
              both Eli's daughter and graddaughter. She has also claimed to be
              a registereed nurse, a cosmetologist; a paralegal; a professional
              writer of romance novels, and a Vietnam Veteran. Ms. Copeland (?)
              claims that she has 10,000 people on her mailing list, groves all
              over the United States, and that she was born in London during
              the Blitz, although she has alos claimed that she was born in
              Houston TX. Ms Garcia (?) claims that her father, a U.S. Army
              Major on Eisenhower's staff during WW II (not, by the way,
              Grandmaster Eli), and her mother, a nurse now resident in
              Atlanta, were both members of the Circle of the Universal Bond.
              She claims that she was raised by a Cherokee grandfather. She
              claims to have been teaching Wicca, which she says is a
              simplified version of Druidism for the masses, since 1954, when
              she was 12 years old.


                                               1508
              

                    Ms Gordon(?) took Lady Sabrin's course from Our Lady of
              Enchanment in 1987 and 1988, giving totally different information
              about herself then she gives now. According to Lady Sabrina,
              Janette has been selling Sabrina's courses as her own ever since.
              We have examined lessons from Janette's and Sabrina's courses,
              and they are indeed substantially identical, except that Sabrina
              can spell.
                    Janette joined ADF in 1987, giving yet another set of data
              about herself, claiming no leadership positions, newsletters, or
              other affiliations. A check of the material on her application
              shows it to be substantially false.
                    In checking Janette's claims, we contacted the Secretary of
              state, and Board of Nursing Registrations in the 14 states in
              which she claimed incorporation. Her organization is incorporated
              only in Washington and California. She is not listed as a
              registered nurse anywhere we checked. She and her group were
              offering BA's, MA's, and PhD's in Washington State until directed
              to cease and desist by the Higher Education Coordinating Board.
              They later obtained a religious exemption by saying that they
              were offering degrees only in Divinity and Theology. Former
              mebers of their organization state that most of their claims in
              their catalog as to available courses and faculty credentials are
              false.
                    In examining their other claims we contacted over two
              hundred persons and groups in this country and abroad in an
              effort to authenticate their initiations and organizational
              affiliations.
                    No one we contacted verified any of the DCSG's claims. All
              stated that they had never trained or initiated any known
              officers or members of the DCSG. Most had never even heard of
              them. Furthur, former members of her organization have mentioned
              paying thousands of dollars for courses, and additional thousands
              paid out on "tithes" -- 10% of their annual income to support the
              work of the Order of Melchizadek (demanded in the middle of their
              initiation or elevation rituals). We have also been contacted by
              Social Serrvices, Education, Law Enforcement and other
              authorities for other information about DCSG, and/or its members.
                    ADF and some other Pagan groups and organziations are
              cooperating fully with these investigations, and have made it
              clear to the investigators that we do not regard these people as
              legitamate members of the Pagan community, since none of their
              alleged training and initiations can be verified, and may have
              been directly disproven. As Pagans, whatever our path, we can
              ill-afford to remain silent while groups knowingly steal and sell
              courses written by others, claiming training ties to the most
              senior and respected members of our community that they do not
              have, and engage in questionable behaviour presenting themselves
              as our kin, elders, and representatives to the world at large.

              Lady Sabrina was initiated by Bob Moshier and Dorothy Trion in
              Tuscon Arizona in 1978, according to what she says. She was in
              Danville, California for a
              while, near San Franscisco; and was in COG (I have not checked
              this); she then studied with Gavin and Yvonne in New Bern for 1 and
              a half years; then moved to Billerica, Mass; then to Hudson, NH;
              then Nashua, NH. I was in Epping, NH when a Gardnerian friend and
              fellow NH College administrator, Gerry Reilly, introduced me to
              Sabrina. Since I am Daughters of the Triple Goddess and Celtic
              Wiccan Order trained, Gerry's brand of witchcraft and Sabrina's
              struck me equally weird.

              I talked to Gavin and Yvonne last week; they feel Sabrina has
              borrowed heavily from them but they don't have an issue with it and
              they don't consider their organisation and hers to be connected.
              In 1987 Geraldine Gumm aka Gerri Garcia aka Queen Druid aka Laura
              Copeland aka Janette Gordon aka Janette Copeland aka Laverna Gordon
              aka Laverna Copeland aka Gerry Garcia aka Gerri Gunn aka Gerri Teah
              Garcia aka Jerry Leah Garcia took Sabrina's course; in winter of
              1989 she began advertising a coorespondence course in Wicca, which
              according to Sabrina is Sabrina's. I've looked at them; they are
              very much alike.  The Frosts and Sabrina both teach non-mainstream
              Wicca and charged for Craft when no one was doing that. I have
              heard far more negative things about some far more mainstream
              figures; both the Frosts and Sabrina are very public and really
              seem to have nothing to hide.  What they teach isn't my Craft, but
              I will defend their right to practice their version and teach it
              as they see fit. Or did you mean something else ?

              Re: ADF letter

              Indeed it is from us. Since then, we have gotten "Janette's" arrest
              and conviction records from New Mexico and word from a usually
              reliable source that her real name may be Geraldine Gumm, and real
              date of birth may be 2-9-40. I am also informed by a law
              enforcement source that she has other records in several states.
              These range from child neglect to unlawful touching of dead bodies
              to kidnapping.

              Her group was investigated in 1975 in Arizona for dead bodies and
              missing persons, moved a bit over a hundred miles as the crow
              flies, and she and her husband were arrested in New Mexico in 1978.
              The children involved were returned to their parents, two being
              kept in social service custody while it was determined to whom they
              belonged, and two members of the group were "deprogramed" by Ted
              Patrick. She was calling herself "Queen Druid" then and initiating
              folks as "WI" or "witch one". I have a lovely pile of court papers
              and newspaper clippings I will gladly share with anyone who'd like
              to send me $4 for photocopying and postage...
