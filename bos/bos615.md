                         Modern Female Rite Of Passage 
                               Lady Shyra, 1994

    Note:  East - Air; South - Fire, West - Water, North - Earth

    EARLY PREPERATIONS

    Candles for the ritual will be made that day.  Celebrant will make two
    white candles.   Candles will be herbal and scented, and enscribed
    appropriately. Celebrant and mother will also bring something that
    symbolically (to them) symbolizes the rite of passage.

    Ritual baths will be taken prior to ceremony, with Celebrant's bath
    being drawn for her.  Salt, herbs and scents appropriate to the occasion
    will be added to the bath, and it will be blessed prior to use.  Mother
    will help Celebrant to the bath, where she will light a candle and
    incense, give words of love and comfort and instruction to the Celeb-
    rant, and then withdraw to assist in Circle Preparation.

    CIRCLE PREPARATION

    Circle area will be cleansed and Circle constructed and consecrated in
    the usual manner.  Altar will sit just West of Center of Circle to
    symbolize both the emotional aspects of the ritual, as well as the
    death/ rebirth aspects.

    Added to altar arrangement will be the Celebrant's two white candles.
    Also on the altar will be a mirror sitting behind and between the two
    white candles.  Symbolic gifts will be placed beside the altar -- the
    mother's to the North symbolizing steadfastness, grounding, caution,
    and wisdom of the elder.  The Celebrant's will be to the South of the
    altar, symboling the fire, passion and impetuosity of youth.

    INVOCATIONS

    Guardian of the East
        Hail to thee, Ancient ones of Air!
        Blow soft around us this night
        That the restrictions and pains of childhood
        Will be but memories in the mind of the adult.

    Guardian of the South
        Hail to thee, Ancient ones of Fire!
        Lend to us this night your passion and strength
        Envelope us in your warmth,
        That the fires of youth may be tempered within thee.

    Guardian of the West
        Hail to thee, Ancient ones of Water!
        Wash over us with thy loving embrace
        That the sorrows of days long past
        Can give way to new understanding.

    Guardians of the North
        Hail to thee, Ancient ones of Earth!
        Stand firm with us in our purpose this night,
        That from the youth shall grow the adult
        Full of purpose and wisdom.
    2720

    Invocation to the Lady
        Blessed Lady of a Thousand Names,
        You who art Maiden, Mother and Crone.
        Grant that this night the bindings of childhood will be broken
        And the bond  between mother and daughter be strengthened.
        For  the two, as so reflected throughout all creation,
        Are but images of thee in thy divine Trinity.
        Blessed Be.

        In honor of thee do I pour this toast, and drink this wine.

    Invocation to the Lord
        Great Lord, Ancient one of the fields and Consort to our Lady,
        We ask that thou wouldst give
        a measure of your love and protection
        to she who will soon join the battles of this life.
        Fill her with the knowledge of thee as sancutary
        And grant that peace may follow her always.

        In honor of thee do I pour this toast, and drink this wine.

    Chalice is then passed to each of the coveners to share in the toast.


    Drawing Down the Moon

    Priestess/Mother stands facing the moon with hands upraised and palms
    turned upwards, cupwise.  Drinking in the Lady's essence, she says,

        Come to me and fill me with thy light
        Enter me, shine in me your fullness
        That I may use your power for my good,
        And for the good of All.

    When appropriate, she blesses all within the Circle, and the rite that
    is about to be performed.  Then, nodding to the Father of the Celebrant,
    says:

        Bring forth your daughter,
        that she might, this night,
        cross the threshold of adulthood.

    Father brings the Celebrant to the Eastern Gate.

    Mthr: Is this the daughter I bore so many years before?
          Nay, it cannot be, for she was but a child when last I held her.

    Dtr:  Mother, I am your child.  Now grown and ready to throw away
          the things of childhood.  Years it has been since my moonflow
          began and I became a woman.  Now it is time that this is recog   
         nized.

    Mthr: Very well, lead the child into the center of the Circle.  There to
    have her sit in silence.

    Father leads Celebrant to the center of the Circle, while mother
    re-closes the Circle.  She then joins her daughter in the Circle's
    center, saying:
    2721

    Mthr: You sit now in the Center of the Circle; that which is known
          as the Cauldron of Hecate; the point of transformation; the
          mother's womb, where beginnings end and endings re-begin.

          I have heard your words, and weep for them; Tears of both joy
          and sorrow.
          It was my body that cried out in pain and joy as you were born.
          It was my mind that went in circles to provide for us.
          It was my heart that broke when that which you wanted I could
          not give you.
          But always did you have my love... and always shall you carry
          that love with you.

          Behold in me the Three-Fold Goddess
          She who is One in Three - Maid, Mother, and Crone
          One in Three, as she is in you and all women,
          And as you and they are in her.
          Look upon her and know her,
          That you, too, may be whole.

          So I ask thee truly, art thou ready to face the woman within thee?
          To see within thee the light and dark, and fear no more the dark?
          To accept that which you are, and strive for that which you can
          become?
          To leave behind the things of childhood,
          But to continue to love and nurture the child which lives in
          all adults?

    {Celebrant has answered accordingly to each of the questions, at which
    time the Mother now exhorts the Celebrant to stand and face the altar.}

    Mthr: Daughter, I ask you now to look deep within the mirror. See
          yourself reflected there.  Look into your eyes and know
          yourself. Repeat after me:"I come to commune with my Soul."

    Dtr:  I come to commune with my Soul.

    Mthr: Look into the reflection of your eyes, and name one thing about
          yourself that you love.

    {Celebrant and Mother will continue this, alternating between what
    the Celebrant thinks is both good and bad within her... }

    After the last question, the Mother then says:

    Mthr: Daughter, within thee is both light and dark. Know always your
          shadow side. If something is there which offends thee horrible,
          give it up.  For others to love you as an adult, you must love
          yourself first.  And loving yourself means giving up any self-
          hatred you've carried over from young years.  Now is the time
          to cut these things from thy life.  They are the bonds of
          childhood which have held you limited. Free yourself from them,
          and know that thy spirit flies free.

          Now look again into the mirror. Look at yourself with love.
          See the Goddess shining within thee. She is strong; no man
          has dominion over her.  She knows herself and loves herself.
          She will give herself to those who are worthy of her affections,
    2722

          and turn from those who try to debase her.  Let the Goddess
          within thee shine through thee, that the nobility and strength
          of woman is clear for all to see.

          Now, come with me.


    Mother embraces daughter and leads her to each of the four quarters.
    After each challenge, the Celebrant must answer as she sees fit, and
    asks the Guardian's Blessing.  The Covener at each gate will then bless
    the Celebrant, and offer a gift for adulthood, such as strength,
    courage, etc... or a physical gift pertinent to the rite and Gate.

    Covener at Eastern Gate:
        Hold!  I am the wild wind and fury of the storm!
        That which buffets thee without shelter.
        How will you survive?

    Covener at Southern Gate
        Hold!  I am fire and passion
        That which will consume thee with lust.
        How will you survive?

    Covener at Western Gate
        Hold!  I am floods and weeping and gnashing of teeth.
        I am lonliness and frustration.
        How will thee survive?

    Covener at Northern Gate
        Hold!  I am chaos and turmoil
        Plans gone wrong and dreams that die.
        How will thee survive?

    Mother faces daughter (Priestess mode ON here)...
        I am the Lady, thy Mother...
        I shall be with thee no matter how far thou shalt roam.
        And when lonliness besets thee,
        Thou needs only gaze upon the moon,
        To see my face and my love reflected there to you.

    Father approaches daugher and turns her to face him...
        I am he who is father to thee now.
        I shall stand behind and beside thee always.
        And when lonliness besets thee,
        Thou needs only to step out into sunlight
        To feel my warmth and love within thee.

    Mother takes daughter by hand and returns to the altar. Daughter picks
    up her gift of childhood and presents it to the mother, saying ...

        This I do give you as a symbol of childhood now behind me.
        Hold it and cherish it as you remember me.


    Mother picks up her gift of adulthood and presents it the Celebrant,
    saying...

        This I do give you as a symbol of your adulthood,
    2723

        and my recognition of it.
        Hold it and cherish it as you remember me.


    Draw a pentegram above the celebrant, with an affirmation at each of the
    five points:

    Point one:   In the name of Inanna, Queen of Heaven

    Point two:   In the name of Athena, warrior Goddess, but also of Peace

    Point three: In the name of Astarte, warrior Goddess, and protector of
            young females
    Point four:  In the name of Diana, she of the bow and arrow, Goddess
            of Light
    Point five:  Do I bless thee, and call thee "Woman".

    May their strenth and independence, their love and virtue, be thine all
    the days of thy life.

    I recognize the child no more, but she the child who lives in all of us.

    Mother stands with a space between her and her daughter and presents
    the new adult to the coven.

    Feasting (and in our case, a birthday celebration) follow.

    Quarter Guardians are thanked, and blessings are asked of the
    Lord and Lady upon the group, as well as the Celebrant.


    Blessed Be * Lady Shyra *
