                             HIGH TECHNOLOGY MEETS THE ANCIENT WISDOM 
                                              By Kenneth Reese 
               
                        Ifyou're like me, you've probably succumbed to some level of
              consumer electronics mania. Maybe it started innocently with a digital
              watch or calculator and then worked its way up to a VCR and then  to a
              personal computer. You might even have  felt some twinge of guilt when
              you suddenly realized these gadgets had become indispensable (when one
              of them  breaks!). Perhaps you've  felt all this runs  counter to your
              commitment to humanistic values. However, as I see it, new age  values
              and technology are inextricably bound together. 
               
                        Thefact thatmany peoplefirst involvedwith thehuman potential
              movement were later drawn into the world of high-tech (and vice versa)
              is a  measure of  the affinity  the two worlds  have for  one another.
              Futurist  John  Naisbitt  identifies  it  as  a high  tech/high  touch
              polarity. For the majority of people who have feet planted in both the
              worlds  of advanced  technology and  human potential the  affinity has
              long been obvious, but perhaps not well articulated. 
               
                        Exactlyhow the interests of thetechnology enthusiast and the
              person  on  the path  merge is  not in  any  way readily  obvious. The
              relationship between the two can be better revealed by considering the
              various tools of  high technology as artificial  devices which magnify
              the  human senses and human experience. With such a comparison several
              observations easily follow. 
               
                        Aclassic example of thismagnification of thehuman senses can
              be  seen  in the  home  video revolution.    Technology is  used  in a
              straightforward fashion as an  extension of the human senses  of sight
              and  hearing.  This   results  in  a  thousand-fold  increase   in  an
              individual's power to receive impressions. This has been made possible
              by   television  combined   with   more  recent   inventions  --   the
              communication  satellite,  back-yard   dishes,  cable,   videocassette
              recorders,  laser discs,  and other breakthroughs  in video  and audio
              technology. In short, for the person in front of the enormous increase
              in   video  and  audio  choices,   there  has,  in   effect,  been  an
              amplification  of  that individual's  capacity  to  experience reality
              through the medium of sight and sound. And, of course, all this choice
              is  delivered by  the exploding  global network  created by  the news,
              communications, and entertainment industries. 
               
                        Similarly, withthe personalcomputer revolution therehas been
              an  amplification of the mind. An individual using a personal computer
              has a level  of technological  power that rivals  that once  available
              only to  large corporations  and governments.   This  magnification of
              power may be used to accomplish a variety of directed tasks or in more
              playful and  creative ways. The net result  is that the individual may
              greatly increase personal productivity  and expand mental and creative
              powers by using an electronic tool. 


                                                                                 965
              

               
                        All  this potential amplification  of the power  of a single
              individual by use of these human-made artifacts greatly increases  the
              need for a center or focus around which unprocessed information can be
              organized  in a  meaningful fashion.  In other  words, the  individual
              requires more than ever a sense of purpose simply because the  
              personal capacity for experience and action has been  greatly enhanced
              by these  new technologies. At this  point, the tie-in to  the new age
              becomes more  obvious.  There  is no  more  exact a  science  for  the
              processing  of  impressions and  the  discovery  of purpose  than  the
              ancient  spiritual   traditions  and  their   modern  expressions   in
              transpersonal psychology and the human potential movement. 
               
                        It  is no accident that new age people often find themselves
              thickly involved  with new technologies. There  is a real  void in the
              midst of the silicon  chip revolution for knowledge which  can balance
              one of the effects of the information age -- a communications 
              explosion which  threatens individual  and cultural stability  with an
              overload of raw, unprocessed  information. This overload confuses both
              individuals  and, more  dangerously, nations  and their  political and
              military institutions.  Spiritual traditions have long taught ways for
              maintaining a center in the face of chaos and offered time-tested  
              techniques  for controlling  the  senses, disciplining  the mind,  and
              discovering purpose and right action. 
               
                        Thisknowledge isnow applicableat bothan individualand global
              level.  Ancient wisdom has never been more relevant than  it is today,
              to  help guide  and  focus  the  tremendous  power  unleashed  by  the
              electronic awakening of the planet. Esoteric knowledge has been sought
              throughout the ages by a select few as a  response to an inner call to
              discover personal meaning in life. Today, the growth of a planet- 
              wide communications network both   enerates the need and  provides the
              means for the spiritual quest to become of vital global importance. 
               
                        The enthusiasm ofsome futurists(such as JohnNaisbitt whoends
              his international best-seller 'Megatrends' with the line 'My God, what
              a fantastic  time to  be alive!')  is a reflection  of the  tremendous
              Power for Good inherent in technological advances. But high technology
              is without a mind or a soul unless it is guided by an intelligence  
              more powerful and compassionate  than simple human cleverness. Ancient
              wisdom provides the vehicle for such an Intelligence. 
               
                        Three decades after the threat of planetary annihilation was
              delivered to humanity  on a silver platter of  scientific achievement,
              it is gratifying that at least the instruments for planetary salvation
              and evolution have  been delivered  by the same  means. However,  this
              possible salvation is a process which can only be achieved by each one
              of  us using the power of our lives  and all the tools at our disposal
              in positive, creative, and purposeful ways. The myth of technology 
              saving  us from  ourselves was  long ago  proven false.  Salvation for
              humanity  is not  a scientific  formula but  a very  human one  -- the
              individual heart in  its search for  God multiplied by  the number  of
              people on this planet. 


                                                                                 966
