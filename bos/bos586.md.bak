    Re: Re: House Blessing notes

    In the spirit of house blessings, and because I'm basically a kitchen
    witch at heart, and like little projects over serious ritual, I offer
    some selections gleaned from Cunningham's The Magical Household. I'm
    typing these without permission but with the hope that they'll
    inspire you to pick up the Cunningham book, because it's wonderful
    stuph... :>

    For the doorway:

    o Suspend over the door a fresh sprig of dill, tied with a blue cord (or
      red, if you prefer), to prevent those who mean you harm from entering.

    o Cross two needles, and stick into or tie onto a corner of your
      doormat, to prevent evil from entering.

    o Grind Dragon's Blood herb into a powder and sprinkle it on door and
      window sills, to protect your house from harm.

    "Witch Bottles"

    o Powder some more Dragon's Blood herb with a small quantity of sugar
      and salt, and place in a small corked or screw-lidded bottle. Shake
      and seal with red wax, then place it where it won't be found (or at
      least not easily seen). This will ensure harmony and peace within
      the house.

    o Place three new needles, three new pins, and three new nails in a
      glass jar. Fill with salt and shake vigorously nine times. Seal with
      white wax and place in kitchen cupboard where it will not be seen.
      This protects your food from contamination.

    o Gather rosemary, along with several needles and pins, into a small
      glass jar with a tight-fitting lid or cork. When full, pour in red
      wine and shake. Seal with black or red wax, and place in an
      inconspicuous place in the apartment. If you own your own house,
      bury this at the furthestmost corner of your property. The book
      also adds this:
              As you're filling the jar, say these words...
              "Pins, needles, rosemary, wine,
              In this witch's bottle of mine;
              Guard against harm and enmity;
              This is my will; so Mote it Be!"
      Personally, I'm not hip on anything but, "Hey, Gods? It's me again",
      but I know, I'm CONSIDERABLY less formal than most!

    An Anti-Theft Sachet

    o Mix caraway, rosemary, juniper berries, and elder leaves or mistletoe,
    and place into white square of cloth. Tie with white yarn and hang
    prominently. I'd assume either at the place you think thieves are most
    likely to enter--this being an anti-theft sachet--or at every entrance
    and doorway. This will require more cloth and more herbs, but most of
    the above are fairly inexpensive.

    Finally, on Moving Day itself:

    o  Bring two things into the house first: a small amount of salt, half
    to be scattered upon crossing the threshhold, and a small loaf of bread.
    Break the bread into as many pieces as you have people moving in, with
    one extra piece for the gods' portion. Sprinkle a dash of salt on each
    piece; share, when you have a moment. (I'd say have water on hand as
    well--at the very least, to clear the salt!) Next, bring in an apple and
    do the same thing--Cunningham recommends a fruit and cheese basket--I'd
    stick with just the apple and maybe a few slices of cheddar, or
    something. Lastly, bring in a sturdy chair and place it either near the
    apple and bread bits, or facing the door. This ensures that you will
    never know poverty, for there is bread and salt, hunger, for there is
    fruit (and cheese), and instability (for there's your stable chair
    guarding the door. After that, heave and lift until you're moved in!

    -------
    A Note: I think ritual is very important, and I do admire rituals I've
    picked up here and those I've found on my own. In the long run, though,
    I know myself well enough to think that if I have to wait for a certain
    day and have a certain robe on, or need a special tool or altar lay-out,
    it'll never happen. But I can put my hands on needles, pins, wine and
    spices at virtually any time, and can easily make up witch's bottles for
    the shelves and cupboards, sachets for the windows, and incenses for
    household protection and cleansing. These simple items can have just as
    much power as just about any major ritual, and are sometimes easier to
    "whip up" for the busy pagan... :>

    -------
                               Cleansing Incense 
    2 parts Dragon's Blood 
    1 part Valerian Root 
    1 part Sulphur 
    1 part Asafoetida 
    In conjunction with any banishing ritual this WILL remove ANY psychic or
    magical impression from your home.  Then you can start fresh filling it
    with the energies you want. 
    It may sound strange but it works! (Though it WILL GAG a Maggot!)
