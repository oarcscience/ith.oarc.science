                                      WITH THESE EIGHT WORDS 
                                     THE WICCAN REDE FULFILL:
                                "AN IT HARM NONE, DO WHAT YE WILL."
                              Copyright 08/17/92 by Servants Of The Elder Gods, Rocky Mountain 
                                                                    Coven and James C. Taylor

                     OVERVIEW.  The purpose of this paper is to look at the Wiccan Rede, at
              the  types  of conduct  it excludes,  and at  the  type of  conduct it
              requires.  We will begin with a detailed examination of the wording of
              the Rede itself, which presents as "pseudo-archaic" but actually makes
              excellent  use of the specific meanings of several archaic words which
              have no real equivalents in contemporary English.  We will then take a
              look at the two sections  of the Rede, and see why they  are presented
              in their proper order  as written.   Finally, we will examine  various
              uses of  magick and see how--and if--they adequately measure up to the
              standard of the Rede.

              THE VOCABULARY  OF  THE WICCAN  REDE.   As mentioned  above, the  Rede
              appears to be presented in a pseudo-archaic or "phony ancient" form of
              English.   Is  this  simply harmless  foolishness,  or is  there  some
              excellent reason for  the vocabulary selected?   Let's take a  look at
              the Rede, word by word.

              AN:       This  word  is commonly  mistranslated as  "IF", which  is a
                        significant error.  The word "AN" is more  accurately trans-
                        lated "JUST SO LONG AS".

              IT:       This  pronoun refers to whatever it is that you are thinking
                        of doing.

              HARM:     This refers to anything which either you or any other person
                        involved or affected  by "it" would regard  as loss, damage,
                        pain,  discomfort,  injustice, invasiveness,  or prevention,
                        relative  to the  situation existing  before "it"  was done.
                        Anything which goes against another person's free will, even
                        if it intends them good, would constitute serious harm.

              NONE:     This  ought to be  self-explanatory.   "None" is  an all-ex-
                        clusive  word.   If you harm  anyone or  anything, including
                        yourself, including a small rock in Trenton, New Jersey, you
                        have harmed "some", not "none".

              DO:       To perform whatever working is contemplated by "IT", above.

              WHAT:     The meaning here is "Whatever", and refers forward.

              YE:       The  archaic PLURAL form of  "you".  The  current word "you"
                        denotes both  the singular and the plural;  the archaic word
                        "YE" is always plural.  We shall see, later on, that this is
                        no accident.

              WILL:     To will something is to exercise your intellectual decision-
                        making power  to determine  the course of  action which  you
                        feel to be  the best.   "Will" has little  or nothing to  do
                        with "wish" or  "want" or "desire".  It is  not an emotional
                        inclination or feeling.   It is the employment of  reason to
                        make a decision based upon your best judgment.

              THE TWO SECTIONS OF THE WICCAN REDE;


                                               1489
              

              A.   SECTION ONE: "AN IT HARM NONE".

                   Why does the Wiccan  Rede not say, "Do  what ye will, an it  harm
                   none"?  There is a reason  why the "An it harm none"  comes first
                   in the Rede,  and that reason  is that "An  it harm none"  is in-
                   tended to come  first in your own thinking, as  a Wiccan initiate
                   and practitioner.   If you or any Wiccan begins  with "Do what ye
                   will", I  assure you  that you, like  the Fundamentalists  before
                   you,  will find a way to excuse  and even to justify anything you
                   take it into  your head to do!  Knowing  this about human nature,
                   the Lady  inspired the Rede to be written  as it is, with the "An
                   it harm none" to come first.

                   The Wiccan Rede's "An  it harm none"  has parallels in many  dis-
                   ciplines.   Perhaps the most significant parallel is found in the
                   Hippocratic Oath  taken by every  physician before  s/he is  cer-
                   tified to practice.  The first part of the Hippocratic Oath binds
                   the physician "First, to do no harm."  It is  sobering to realize
                   that  magical ethics,  as set forth  in the  Wiccan Rede,  are or
                   should  be so  similar to  medical ethics, an  issue with  such a
                   powerful effect on so many lives.

                   When we read of a physician who  has violated his medical ethics,
                   we  read this  with outrage  toward him  and with  empathy toward
                   those patients who suffered inadequate care because the physician
                   violated his  ethics.  It is more sobering to realize that future
                   generations will  regard violations  of magickal ethics  with the
                   same degree of outrage, and rightly so.

              B.   SECTION TWO:  "DO WHAT YE WILL."

                   Even  without the first  part of the  Rede, "Do what  ye will" is
                   most certainly not a blanket permission to do whatever you desire
                   to do.   As one Wiccan High  Priestess has observed, "Power  cor-
                   rupts,  and absolute power corrupts absolutely."  Seems like I've
                   heard that before,  but it's certainly  true when you're  talking
                   about  using real  magick to  accomplish real  goals in  the real
                   world.


                                               1490
              

                   When  we realize the kinds  and orders of  results, both expected
                   and unexpected,  both  knowable and  unknowable, which  eventuate
                   from almost every human action, it would seem the better part  of
                   both valor and wisdom to never do anything at all, especially not
                   anything which is  done with  spiritual power guided  by no  more
                   than  human wisdom!    Unfortunately, to  do  nothing is  also  a
                   choice, and the results of inaction are often  far worse than the
                   results  of even ill-considered action.   This is  why the second
                   half of the Rede demands that we make a decision and act upon it,
                   as  well as conforming that  decision to the  requirement that it
                   harm none. 

              THE STANDARD OF  THE REDE.  Please note that  the Wiccan Rede contains
              no loop-holes whatsoever.  The Rede does  not say, "An it harm none to
              the best  of your knowledge."  The Rede also  does not say "An it harm
              none  to the  best of  your ability  to discern  whether it  will harm
              someone."

              The  Wiccan Rede  does not say  these things,  or anything  similar to
              them.  It simply  says "An it harm NONE, do what ye will."  This means
              that  YOU, once  you have committed  to live  by the  Wiccan Rede, are
              committed  to be solely and totally responsible for any harm resulting
              from ANY ACTION YOU TAKE, MAGICKAL OR NOT.

              Paul  Seymour's forthcoming  book begins  with some  strong cautionary
              notes concerning the use of  magick.  One of the examples he  gives is
              particularly tragic, and concerns  a young man who worked a simple and
              apparently  harmless "money spell".   The spell worked,  and the young
              man got his money--he inherited it, when his  parents were both killed
              in an accident shortly after he worked the spell. 
              Paul does not say in his book if this young man was a Wiccan initiate.
              If he was, then in addition to his sorrow and loss, he has had to live
              with  the fact  that, by the  standard of  the Rede,  he is ultimately
              responsible for the death of his parents.

              When you  commit to live according  to the Wiccan Rede,  you commit to
              conform  your entire life, not  just the magickal,  mystical and reli-
              gious aspects  of it, to  the standard set  by the Rede.   Never again
              will you be able to act impulsively or without considering the results
              of what you do.  Never again will  you be able to act or even speak in
              thoughtless irritation or anger.   Instead, you will come  to consider
              the  implications of every word you speak, and of every routine action
              you do.  For  it is not just by  magick that we can harm  ourselves or
              others; everything we do, and everything  we say, has the potential to
              help or harm others, and to help or harm ourselves.


                                               1491
              

              It is also  important to note that  the Rede sets up  a standard which
              prevents us  from harming ourselves  as well as others.   Other relig-
              ions, including Christianity, regard it as virtuous to suffer harm for
              the sake  of another, even to  die so that another  person might live.
              The Wiccan Rede does not permit this.   You are to harm none, and this
              means that you  are not to harm  yourself, even for the  sake of doing
              good for someone else.
              To some, this may seem like  a selfish standard.  But think about  it.
              Would you wish to benefit by someone else's injury or death? Of course
              not!  If you did derive some benefit, such as an inheritance, from the
              death of another person, would  you feel good about this?   Well, some
              people might, but  probably you would not.  Therefore, in a very  real
              sense, you yourself are harmed by a benefit you derive from the injury
              or death of another.  True, the  harm is emotional, but it is entirely
              real.

              Wicca  recognizes that human beings  are social creatures.   What does
              harm  to one, does harm  to all in varying degrees.   Therefore, it is
              imperative that each person strive to harm no one, himself  or herself
              included.

              Finally, it  is significant to note  that word "ye" in  the statement,
              "Do what YE will."  This  is the ancient plural form of "you",  and it
              means  that your individual will is assumed  to be in accord with some
              other will, instead of acting entirely on its own.

              What is this other will which, together with yours, comprises the "ye"
              in the Rede?   Well, if you are working  in a coven, it could  well be
              the combined  will of the members  of the coven.   But this  would not
              apply to those who are working on their own, and it is not the highest
              or best meaning, even for those working in coven. 
              How does one act, so as to be  certain to harm none?  Not by  refusing
              to act, since inaction is itself a decision, and often causes far more
              harm than even rash action.  Not by delaying action until the time for
              it  is past, because that is the same as inaction.  And not by relying
              solely upon your own human wisdom, either.

              The best way to act, so as to be certain to harm none, is to call upon
              the Goddess and/or the  God, and to  hand to Them  the power you  have
              raised, together with the situation you have raised  the power to deal
              with, and say, "You are holy, good, and wise, and know how to use this
              power to help and not harm.  Do Your  will in this situation.  That is
              my will, that Your will be done."  And thus the Rede is fulfilled: For
              the "ye" who will are yourself and Them-selves, who are good, and love
              humanity, and who always act for the highest good of all.
