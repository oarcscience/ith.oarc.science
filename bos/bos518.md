                                    *       
                                            
                 THE FALSE KNIGHT UPON THE ROAD (Child #3)
                                    -recorded by Steeleye Span
                                            
            "Oh where are you going to?"    
                           said the False Knight upon the road
            "Oh I'm going to my school."    
                           said the wee boy and still he stood
            "What is that upon your back?"  
                           said the False Knight upon the road
            "Ah weel, it is my books!"      
                           said the wee boy and still he stood
                                            
     Oh, what have you got there?           I wish you was on the sands.
     I have got my bread and cheese!        Yes, and a good staff in my hands!
     Oh won't you give me some?             I wish you was on the sea.
     No, ne'r a bite or crumb!              And a good ship under me!
                                            
                           And the ship to sink.
                           An inch away from shore!
                           I think I hear a bell.
                           And it rings you straight to Hell!
                                            
                                *           


                                                                                2309
