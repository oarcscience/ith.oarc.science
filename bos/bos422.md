                                                     Inquisition 
                Again the burning came,
                She felt the heat, the searing pain
                a cry lanced through her heart
                   "Why, My Lady, Why"

                She lay quietly, remembering
                lost within the labrynth of the past
                and the future
                she did not feel the bite of the cruel blade.




              Bleeding, moaning, she saw the man
                his face, and heart masked with black
                she knew his choices and his pain
                Oh, to cause pain, to accept his own
                if only she could Touch him, Heal him.

                "I love you" she whispered
                dark eyes calm, yet full of pain
                "Don't " cried the man "I want to see you die"
                "I love you and forgive you" she said
                tears rolled freely down her cheeks

                Again, and again the searing pain
                As the man applied the red hot blade
                "Do you still love me, and forgive me" he screamed?

                Despite the pain she answered strongly
                "I do", She smiled
                "Blessed be" she whispered.

                A wave of pain sent her among the stars.
                "My Lady" she cried "I'm frightened"
                Strong arms held her close
                "You have done well my child, rest now"

                The man watched as the blade grew cold
                As the young body before him cooled
                tears streamed down his face
                and he whispered
                    "Forgive me"

                                                                                               1907
