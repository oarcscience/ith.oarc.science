# Cleansing

#### Rowan Moonstone 05-28-89

When I cleanse a dwelling place, first I burn a good cleansing incense,
like frankincense or sandalwood in the home while I prepare for the rest
of the ritual. You should have in addition to the incense, a candle, a
bowl of salt water and a bowl of herbs. I particularly like to use rose
buds for love, lavender for preservation, rosemary for protection, and
any other sweet-smelling ones that appeal to you personally. If you can
get them home-grown, so much the better. You should proceed around the
house, widdershins (counterclockwise) and cleanse the area with the salt
water. Be sure to get each corner, window, door, drain, etc. Simply
sprinkle a little salt water on each and ask that any evil or disruptive
influences leave the place. When this is finished, proceed around the
house deosil (clockwise) sprinkling the blessing herbs and invoke
whatever deities or properties you wish on the home, such as peace,
prosperity, tranquility, etc. In the past, I have used 3 candles on the
central altar. Blue, symbolizing tranquility, green for healing and
prosperity, and purple for protection. Others might be pink for love, or
brown for hearth and home. You and anyone who is to share the home with
you should share food and drink, and don't forget to leave a little of
the food and drink to take outside and return to the Earth that which
has been given.  
Blessed Be. Rowan
