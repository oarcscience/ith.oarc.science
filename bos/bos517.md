                              *             
                                            
                        JOHN BARLEYCORN     
                                            
      There were three men come out of the West 
      Their fortunes for to try,            
      And these three men made a solemn vow:
      John Barleycorn should die!           
      John Barleycorn should die!           
                      (nb: 4th line of each verse is sung twice)
                                            
      They plowed, they sowed, they harrowed him in,
      Threw clods upon his head,            
      And these three men made a solemn vow:
      John Barleycorn was dead!             
                                            
      CHORUS: Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
              Sing fa la la lay oh!         
              Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
              Sing fa la la lay oh!         
                                            
      They let him lie for a very long time 
      'Til the rain from Heaven did fall,   
      Then Little Sir John sprung up his head,
      And so amazed them all!               
                                            
      They let him stand 'til Midsummer tide,
      'Til he grew both pale and wan,       
      Then Little Sir John he grew a long beard,
      And so became a man!                  
                                            
      They hired men with the sythes so sharp
      To cut him off at the knee            
      They rolled him and tied him about the waist,
      And used him barbarously!             
                                            
      They hired men with the sharp pitchforks
      To pierce him to the heart,           
      And the loader he served him worse than that,
      For he tied him in a cart!            
                                            
      They wheeled him around and around the field,
      'Til they came to a barn,             
      And there they made a solemn mow      
      Of poor John Barleycorn,              
                                            
      They hired men with the crab-tree sticks
      To strip him skin from bone           
      And the Miller he served him worse than that:
      For he ground him between two stones! 
                                            
      They have wheeled him here and wheeled him there
      And wheeled him to a barn,            
      And they have served him worse than that
      They have bunged him in a vat!        
                                            
                      (more)                
                                                                                    



                        John Barleycorn (cont.)                 
                                            
      They have worked their will on John Barleycorn
      But he lived to tell the tale;        
      For they pour him out of an old brown jug,
      And they call him home-brewed ale!    
                                            
      Here's Little Sir John in a nut-brown bowl,
      And brandy in a glass!                
      And Little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl
      Proved the stronger man at last!      
                                            
      For the huntsman he can't hunt the fox
      Nor loudly blow his horn,             
      And the tinker can't mend kettles nor pots
      Without John Barleycorn!              
                                            
    (Note: sing the chorus after every other verse or so. Encourage the group
    to join the song)                       
                                            
                              *             
                                                                                2308
