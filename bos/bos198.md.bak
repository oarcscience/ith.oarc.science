                               Personal Effects of Magic Ritual 
                                          By Nihasa 
          
          LC> I am exploring the power of change, as applied to 
          LC> ritual. When I step out of my suit and tie and into my 
          LC> ceremonial robe, then step out of my rooms and into my 
          LC> temple, then leave behind my everyday life and enter 
          LC> into the sacred space, what is it that makes it 'work' 
          LC> for me? 
         . 
         One part of the effect seems to come from an unconscious pact 
         you make with your many-faceted mind. When you remove your 
         "street" clothes, you give your mind permission to likewise 
         "put off" important thoughts about "mundane" life until you 
         return to those clothes. Notice that I don't say "compel 
         your mind" to avoid those thoughts...that generally doesn't 
         work very well. Instead, you acknowledge the importance of 
         the mundane thoughts and promise to return to them after the 
         ceremony (gee, did you know you were being so polite to your 
         self? <-;). 
         . 
         Likewise, when you don your ceremonial robes you invite your 
         mind to start focusing on the ceremony ahead and the general 
         context of such ceremonies and their associated mental 
         states. For those who work 'skyclad', this effect is often 
         achieved by tieing on a cord or putting on ritual jewelry. 
         When you step into the ritual chamber, you reiterate those 
         invitations while you step out of the transition and into 
         the magick. 
         . 
         These dynamics are fairly universal...they are the same for 
         a Christian priest and his vestments or a Toreador and his 
         Suit of Lights; from an actor slipping into his costume and 
         character to a couple slipping into those "special" night- 
         things. The mechanics vary from a simple "change clothes and 
         walk in" to elaborately formal vesting rituals with 
         prescribed chants and gestures at each stage. In NLP we call 
         the clothes and places "anchors", while others call them 
         reminders, Mnemonics, or talismans. They can be constructed 
         consciously or evolve unconsciously. 
         .
