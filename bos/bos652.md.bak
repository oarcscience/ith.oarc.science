                 "People that eat blowfish are stupid. 
            People that do not eat blowfish are also stupid."
                                            --Japanese proverb


       With  the advent of the New Age,  many people are airing great 
    new  ways  to change your life for the better.  These  ideas  are 
    based  on the premise that we have total control of our lives  on 
    some level.  All we need do is reach that level with our desires. 
    This is,  of course,  the big challenge. You can read millions of 
    words on that subject.  Why is there so much information? Because 
    achieving this kind of control is a very individual thing.  There 
    are  so many different ways that each person could write his  own 
    book.  To succeed,  each must find his own path. The reason there 
    are  instructions  at  all,  though,  is because  each  can  find 
    guidance in the successes of others.  Magick is one of these many 
    guides.
        
       This  file is relatively short because it concentrates less on 
    the  myriad  details of magick and more on how to find  your  own 
    path.  The  task  is never as easy as it sounds,  but it  is  not 
    complex,  either.  With straight forward exercises (good,  honest 
    work on your Self) you will achieve whatever you desire.  We  all 
    have  this  power.  The  way we use it is not by  gaining  a  new 
    ability,  but by getting out of the way of the ability we already 
    have. This book outlines the basic blocks and the kinds of things 
    to  do about them.  But,  as with any advice,  it is up to you to 
    honestly  assess your own situation and discover what works  best 
    for you.  Remember,  achieving your personal Power is  everyone's 
    path  in life.  You will succeed,  it is only a question of when. 
    This  book  is designed to bring that success more  quickly  and, 
    overall, more easily.

       Many  people  these  days still appeal  to  the  "booga-booga" 
    aspect of magick:  "We will grant you incredible powers to use on 
    whomever  you please if you send us money." As we enter into  the 
    New Age of understanding,  people are learning that occult powers 
    are actually a natural part of everyone's life. It is our goal to 
    help  this process along.  We hope to teach newcomers what magick 
    is about.  This book is written not only to inform,  but also  to 
    circumvent  the  psychological  barriers set up by  living  in  a 
    mechanistic society. The mechanistic paradigm (the idea that each 
    person  and  object  is  totally separate from the  rest  of  the 
    universe  except through physical interaction)  precludes  magick
    (non-physically   affecting  one's  environment).   The  magickal 
    paradigm  states  that your beliefs  create  your  reality.  This 
    choice  is like contemplating eating blowfish-- when  you analyze 
    it,  you  can  conclude that adopting either paradigm is  stupid. 
    Since you can't please everyone else,  pick the one that you like 
    best. If (and only if) the magickal paradigm appeals to you, then 
    choose it. Then the trick is to get out of the mind-set that says 
    that  magick  is  impossible.  We hope that  you  will  try  some 
    exercises  to prove to yourself that magick works.  Once you have 
    3266

    done  so,  then  you  are on the way to  achieving  anything  you 
    desire.
                           
                                  POWER

       Power can be a very misleading term.  The way most people mean 
    it is in the sense of "power-over." People recognize power as the 
    ability to get others to do what you want,  especially when these 
    others  have different ideas.  This is not Power (with a  capital 
    'P')  at all.  When you rely on someone else to do something  for 
    you,  you  give  your Power to him.  This is very different  from 
    doing something *with* someone,  then both parties gain.  But, to 
    believe  that you must force or trick another is to say that  you 
    need this person to do something that you cannot.  You may  steal 
    their power (lower case) but you give away your Power. 

       Power  is,  among  other things,  the innate ability to  bring 
    whatever you truly desire into your life.  When you "make" others 
    manifest them for you,  you create blocks in your own mind. These 
    blocks say "I cannot do this myself," which obstructs your Power. 
    This is "giving away your Power." 

       When you "take your Power," you accept responsibility for your 
    life.  This  is not guilt or martyrdom,  it is honestly assessing 
    your  life  and recognizing your  successes  and  failures.  Give 
    yourself  credit for even the smallest success and recognize that 
    you  can overcome every obstacle.  Then you allow your  Power  to 
    express  itself.  What you need comes to you;  projects work  for 
    you.

       We  often  think  of many  obstacles  as  insurmountable.  For 
    instance,  many  believe  the lottery to be their only  desperate 
    hope of escaping poverty.  Such people give away their Power. And 
    why  shouldn't they?  Everything they've experienced  tells  them 
    this.  Our  whole  society is rooted in the mechanistic  paradigm 
    (all causes and effects have a physical link),  which precludes a 
    belief in Power.  How is one to know that this concept works? How 
    can  this be real when it is so different from what we  are  used 
    to?

       Our  society  has  a  concept of  "Reality"  as  an  objective 
    existence  of  which  we are all a part.  When  two  people  have 
    different  ideas of the nature of some detail,  then at least one 
    is Wrong. We all have a fear of being Wrong. When we are Wrong we 
    miss out on things and people don't like us as much. Therefore we 
    desperately strive to be Right.  It turns out that Right is  what 
    ever  those around you happen to feel that it should be.  It's as 
    if  they  all  took a vote when you were out  of  the  room.  But 
    "Right" changes all the time: from preservatives are harmless, to 
    preservatives  cause cancer;  from Stalin is a great  leader,  to 
    Stalin  was a monster;  from Ptolemy explains the forces  of  the 
    universe perfectly, to Newton explains the forces of the universe 
    perfectly,  to  Einstein  explains  the forces  of  the  universe 
    perfectly.  The  philosophy  of science this calls this  evolving 
    better  (or at least different) explanations.  Yet,  while  these 
    ideas hold sway, people call them "Reality."

       Just how reliable is Reality?  We all live our lives using our 
    3267

    individual concepts of Reality to get along. We update them as we 
    see fit. But few will fundamentally change their concepts. We are 
    sure  that,  although we may not have the details,  we  certainly 
    have  a  feel  for  the basics.  Anyone who  disagrees  with  the 
    mechanistic paradigm,  for instance,  must be missing at least  a 
    few  marbles.  Such a person is irrational in a universe that  we 
    know to be rational.

       But  is the universe truly rational?  Science has pursued the 
    mechanistic  paradigm  down  to  the  smallest  scale,   particle 
    physics;  here  it fails to explain the  universe.  The  building 
    blocks  of Reality do not behave rationally.  If you drive a  car 
    from one side of a mountain to the other and you have a choice of 
    two  tunnels,  you  will drive through one of them.  If a  single 
    electron has a choice of two holes in a plate to pass through, it 
    will go through both. You can plot the speed and position of your 
    car  to the limit of the accuracy of your  instruments,  but  you 
    will never be able to do both to that electron. 

       When you observe this mythical car,  it is a solid object.  If 
    it were not,  it would not be a car. If you drove it around, then 
    tested  to  see if the car were not solid and discovered that  it 
    wasn't,  what  would you think?  Around the turn of the  century, 
    scientists figured out that light acts like a wave when you  test 
    for a wave,  and like a particle when you test for a particle. In the 
    regular world it must be one *or* the other.  The two are as 
    mutually exclusive as a non-solid car that you can none the  less 
    drive.  Mysteriously,  light was behaving like both.  Eventually, 
    scientists concluded that light doesn't work like the universe we 
    are  used to.  The act of observing light defines its  character. 
    This  is  called  wave-particle duality.  Later in  the  century, 
    scientists  found that atomic particles,  the building blocks  of 
    all matter, behave this way, too.

       Now  imagine  that  you  can find no evidence  that  this  car 
    crosses  the space between where you see it and where you saw  it 
    last.  Suppose  the  car isn't actually "there" when  you're  not 
    looking--  the  act of looking brings it  into  "existence." What 
    would you think if noticed that your expectations seem to have an 
    effect on where it turns out to be?  This is awfully strange, but 
    it  is  the  kind  of universe  that  particle  physicists  find. 
    "Looking  at"  a subatomic particle "brings it  into  existence." 
    Also,  scientists are finding that whatever kind of particle they 
    expect  to  find in an experiment,  tends to be  there.  This  is 
    starting  to  look less like brilliant theory and  more  like  an 
    effect  of the observers.  They are no longer separate from their 
    experiments. It turns out that the universe doesn't actually work 
    the way we've always assumed it does.

       This  is  the nature of matter on the smallest scale,  and  it 
    doesn't make sense in every day life.  This does not mean that we 
    should abandon our present ideas of how to live.  Keep what works 
    ("If  it  ain't broke,  don't fix it").  Particle  physics  won't 
    affect how you drive through tunnels,  for instance.  But, if you 
    accept  physics,  the epitome of the mechanistic  paradigm,  this 
    means  that our mechanistic ideas of how the universe  works  are 
    fundamentally  incomplete.   In  other  words,   the  mechanistic 
    paradigm is not the whole story. 
    3268

       Big deal.  What does this mean in a practical sense? The world 
    seems  to  work  just  the same as it did  when  the  mechanistic 
    paradigm was unchallenged. But what if our preconceptions dictate 
    what we are aware of?  It is a common trick to set up a group  of 
    people  for  startling  event and see how many  will  overlook  a 
    strange inconsistency.  In one instance, a teacher took a student 
    off  into an adjoining room on a pretext.  There was the sound of 
    an argument and a crash and the student ran out through the room. 
    One of the other students suspected a set up and she was the only 
    one  who  noticed that the teacher's accomplice  was  carrying  a 
    bone.  A much more dramatic example is the story of Magellan's ships. 
    When the explorer landed on a particular island, the natives, who 
    had never seen europeans before, recognized them as funny looking 
    men  in funny looking little boats.  But Magellan soon found that 
    the  natives  were unaware of the large ships that  carried  them 
    there,  though they were impossible to overlook.  The natives had 
    seen men and small boats before,  but they had never seen a large 
    ship.  Such a thing was outside of their experience and therefore 
    outside  of their comprehension.  Their eyes must have  seen  the 
    ships,  but their brains did not.  The natives gathered to try to 
    see them, staring intently at where they supposed to be anchored. 
    Soon  the local shaman could discern the barest outline which  he 
    described  to  the  others.  Eventually they could  all  perceive 
    ships.
       
       Who  can  say what we make ourselves unaware of?  It  is  only 
    after  we've expanded our perception that we learn how limited it 
    was  before.  But we can't go around indiscriminately  "expanding 
    our  consciousness."  What we choose to believe is based  on  our 
    desires. If you are happy with what you believe, the is no reason 
    to  change.  "If  it  ain't  broke,  don't  fix  it."  Change  is 
    challenging and even if you succeed,  it may well be  unpleasant. 
    But  if  you feel unable to overcome obstacles in your life  (and 
    you *really*  want to),  then you have nothing to  loose.  Magick 
    will only expand possibilities.  If it's all a crock, you've lost 
    nothing. If it's true, you can do anything you're willing to work 
    for.  It is a draw-win situation. The only way you can lose is to 
    make  your choice out of fear.  Don't let the opinions of  others 
    influence what you choose to believe. Don't give away your Power. 
    Everyone else is in the same situation you are,  so when it comes 
    to your own life, there is no greater authority than yourself. If 
    you're  interested in magick,  try it and see for yourself if  it 
    works for you.

                             WHAT MAGICK IS

    Magick is a way of using your Power.  More technically, magick is 
    the  process of non-physically affecting your environment through 
    messages consciously impressed on the subconscious with a  system 
    of symbols.  (This will become clear later.) This is the broadest 
    definition and it can include such things as prayer,  meditation, 
    chanting,  positive thinking,  subliminal tapes,  programming and 
    hypnotism.

    Some think that magick is unnatural and evil.  It is no more evil 
    than  any  tool.  A  knife,  for instance,  is "good"  or  "evil" 
    depending  on its use.  It can be invaluable in  many  beneficial 
    projects,  yet  it  can also harm.  Nothing is immune to  misuse. 
    People even try to use prayer against others.  Such potential  is 
    not a reason for fear,  but for respect.  The idea that magick is 
    unnatural is a modern misconception. Magic has only recently come 
    to  mean Hollywood special effects or pulling rabbits from  hats. 
    It  is often spelled magick in order to distinguish it from  this 
    new   meaning.   For   millennia  magick  has  been  a  path   to 
    enlightenment  and  self mastery or just plain getting  what  you 
    want.  It is nothing supernatural. Magick uses natural powers and 
    the  natural flow of the universe to bring about the changes  you 
    desire. We are so immersed in magick that, like still air, we are 
    unaware  of  it.  We all use this  power  without  thought,  like 
    breathing. Magick is using these powers with awareness.

    Magick  involves  placing  a message of your choosing  into  your 
    subconscious.  This is all that is necessary to achieve any goal. 
    The power of the subconscious is awesome.  When you unite it with 
    your  conscious will,  you can do anything you want.  Remove  the 
    internal barriers and the external barriers melt  away.  Oriental 
    philosophy would call this "following the Tao." Achieving this is 
    the challenge of magick.

                            HOW MAGICK WORKS

       How  can programming the subconscious affect the world  around 
    us?  What  are the mechanisms involved?  According to the  occult 
    view, it works because that is the nature of the universe.

       In the West,  we use the mechanistic paradigm. A paradigm is a 
    pattern  or model,  in this case describing the way the  universe 
    works.  We  use  paradigms  to  function,  usually  without  even 
    realizing  it.  The mechanistic paradigm is one of the most basic 
    that  underlie our culture.  This model states that there  is  an 
    objective  reality  in  which  objects  interact  solely  through 
    physical contact. Science has updated this to include fields like 
    gravity and magnetism,  but the principle is the same. The result 
    is  a universe in which the individual is nearly  powerless.  You 
    can only make real change through physical action.  Magick is the 
    act of making such changes non-physically,  so it does not fit in 
    with the mechanistic paradigm.

       Most   westerners  are  unaware  that  the  magickal  paradigm 
    represents a majority view among the world's cultures. Basically, 
    it  is  the antithesis of the mechanistic view.  It  states  that 
    there is no objective universe,  only subjective universes. These 
    3270

    universes  are the perceptions of each individual.  You  couldn't 
    possibly  do any experiment that would show your universe  to  be 
    either subjective or objective. You must be an objective observer 
    in  order  to  tell  the  difference.  You  are  automatically  a 
    subjective observer because you are in the universe. That's life. 

       At this point,  there is no practical difference between these 
    views.  The universe looks the same either way.  But the magickal 
    paradigm  also states that the universe is an expression of  your 
    perceptions  and your perceptions are that part of yourself  over 
    which  you have control.  When you change your own attitudes  and 
    preconceptions,   the   universe  will  follow.   This  gives  an 
    individual  as  much  power  over the universe  as  he  has  over 
    himself.

                               Metaphysics

    We  obviously  don't exercise infinite power.  There is  more  to 
    magick than merely having a desire or belief.  That is because we 
    have  many conflicting desires and beliefs on many levels.  There 
    is  a level called,  among other things,  the Little  Self.  This 
    roughly  corresponds to the subconscious and the super  ego.  The 
    ego,  the  part of ourselves which we think of as "I," is  called 
    the Middle Self. The Little Self is the gateway to the High Self, 
    our connection with godhead and the universe. Infinite power lies 
    with  the High Self,  but our access is through the  Little  Self 
    which has its own ideas.  The Little Self is aware of and accepts 
    everything around it and everything you think,  even when you are 
    not  aware.  These perceptions build up very strong ideas in  the 
    Little Self.  When these ideas are different from yours (those of 
    the Middle Self),  your ideas loose.  To succeed,  you must unify 
    your will. 

       Of  course,  people  rightfully  complain that even if  we  do 
    create our universe,  it's still tough to make changes.  That  is 
    because  there is quite a bit of inertia to ideas that have  been 
    strongly  supported  since childhood (or before,  if  you  accept 
    past-lives).  In an extreme example, the original "Peter Pan" had 
    to  be  changed to keep from harming children.  In  the  original 
    version,  the  characters  flew  because  "they  believed."  Many 
    children  attempted to fly and discovered the hard way that their 
    Little Self did not agree. Things like a belief in gravity may be 
    possible  to overcome,  but no one will argue that it's  commonly 
    done. 

       This example sounds silly because our experience of gravity is 
    so  compelling  that  it seems ridiculous to consider  it  to  be 
    "merely  a thought construct." But another belief that is  nearly 
    as  widespread is that of poverty.  This is a significantly  less 
    daunting belief which many have overcome.  As long as you believe 
    you  are poor,  you will be.  This is often a very strong belief. 
    Many  cannot even genuinely imagine themselves as being  wealthy. 
    But,  because  it is not beyond reasonable comprehension,  it  is 
    possible  to reprogram your Little Self-- much  as  it's possible 
    for  left-handers  to  learn to be  right-handed.  Magick  is  an 
    effective way to do this.

       If you are unconvinced,  consider how many little messages you 
    3271

    heard  when  growing  up,  which you now believe on  some  level. 
    Frequent messages, especially with children, usually become true. 
    If  you  have heard all your life that you are poor  or  dumb  or 
    unsuccessful, eventually you believe it and eventually it's true. 
    You  probably  know many people with an unjustifiably  poor  self 
    image.  This  is  an  image which their Little  Selves  accepted, 
    probably during childhood when they couldn't protect  themselves. 
    That is how messages to the Little Self work against you. And the 
    Little Self is aware of everything,  even when you are asleep. It 
    also believes everything it hears. So the next time that you hear 
    that  you're not good or that you need to buy a product that  you 
    don't really want,  consciously give your Little Self a different 
    message. Talk to it and tell it what you want to believe. This is 
    what  makes your universe,  so make it the way you want it.  When 
    you  have a particularly powerful belief to  overcome,  then  you 
    must send a powerful message. That is the role of magick.

                                Religion

       The religious rendition of magick is prayer. Although they are 
    different things, the principles are similar. Techniques that are 
    effective for one will work very well in the other. In fact, they 
    use  many  common symbols.  One could say that magick is  secular 
    prayer.

       Prayer  works when "God answers it." This is entirely in  line 
    with  the metaphysical explanation.  You can say that the  Higher 
    Self is God or your connection to God. This is simply a different 
    way  of expressing the same ineffable principles.  You can  adapt 
    anything  here  to fit into your views.  Don't let the way  these 
    concepts are phrased put you off.  Feel free to interpret this as 
    much  as  you like in order to make it acceptable and  usable  to 
    you.

                               Psychology

       The  explanations so far require new way of thinking about the 
    universe,  but those entrenched in the mechanistic paradigm  need 
    not miss out. Psychology has enough respect as a science to offer 
    hope. If you replace Little Self with subconscious, the principle 
    is  the  same.  Although there is no longer a source of  infinite 
    power or non-physical change. But influencing the subconscious is 
    the next best thing in a mechanistic world. 

       Psychologists   would   say  that  magick  directs  all   your 
    unconscious  efforts toward your goal.  It also eliminates  those 
    unconscious  efforts  keeping you from your goal.  This  may  not 
    sound like much, but it is primarily these efforts that determine 
    success or failure.  It is easy to overlook because, for the most 
    part,  the  conscious will is the same as the  unconscious  will. 
    Thus,  we succeed at endeavors such as waking up, getting to work 
    on  time and fixing dinner.  This may seem silly,  but when  your 
    subconscious  doesn't  share  a  goal,   even  simple  tasks  are 
    exceptionally difficult. The power of the subconscious can either 
    fight  you  or  help you.  Where ever you  succeed,  it's  almost 
    certainly  helping.  Where ever you fail,  it's almost  certainly 
    fighting.

    3272

       The  subconscious represents everything the mind does that  we 
    do not think about.  This involves a most of what we do. When you 
    are  driving  on a familiar freeway in good conditions,  you  are 
    usually  thinking  about  the  music  on  the  radio  or  salient 
    problems.  At such times it is your subconscious driving.  If you 
    notice  something strange in the road,  it was your  subconscious 
    that brought it to your attention. This is very helpful, but that 
    isn't  necessarily the case.  The subconscious can throw  up  all 
    kinds  of barriers,  preventing even the simplest tasks.  It  can 
    make  you late for work when it doesn't feel like going-- you can 
    wake  up  late,  feel  ill,  misplace car keys or  even  have  an 
    accident.  This influence sometimes goes to the extremes.  People 
    can even be paralyzed by hysteria, a condition that lies entirely 
    within  the  mind.  Pathological fears are  another  example.  An 
    agoraphobe,  for instance,  can have such an extreme reaction  to 
    being outdoors that he cannot leave his house no matter how badly 
    he wants to.

       The  subtle  action  of  the subconscious  can  be  almost  as 
    profound.   Even  when  the  influence  of  the  subconscious  is 
    indistinguishable  from  chance happenings,  on larger scale  the 
    effect is dramatic.  Psychologists try to ensure that experiments 
    are  "double  blind"  for  this  reason.  They  must  set  up  an 
    experimental group and a control group.  In the latter,  there is 
    only the single element,  the target of the experiment,  that  is 
    different. 
     
       In  drug  testing,  experimenters  use placebos on  a  control 
    group.  The act of administering a substance can have a  profound 
    mental effect, even when that substance is inert, a placebo. When 
    they expect effective drugs, people can have great results with a 
    placebo.  But  the "placebo effect" is purely  psychological.  If 
    either the experimenter or the subject think that they know which 
    is  being administered,  that is enough to throw off the results. 
    The  subconscious  of  the subject reacts  to  what  the  subject 
    expects. If the experimenter knows what he is administering, then 
    the subject's subconscious reacts to cues from the experimenter's 
    subconscious.  This  is sometimes called the "Clever Hans effect" 
    after  a horse which seemed to be able to do  math.  In  reality, 
    clever  Hans but was reacting to cues from the people around him. 
    When someone near him knew the answer, the horse could sense that 
    person's  expectation.  It was sometime before  researchers  even 
    considered   these   nearly  invisible   clues.   Although   such 
    subconscious  actions  are  very subtle,  they  can  dramatically 
    change the results of an experiment.

       The  subconscious  similarly affects results in your  life  as 
    well.  Magick programs the subconscious to work for you.  This is 
    not  as potent as the metaphysical concept,  but it will make you 
    as  effective as you can possibly be in a  mechanistic  world.  A 
    unified  will directs all your efforts,  conscious and otherwise, 
    toward   your   goal.   Since  the   subconscious   can   present 
    insurmountable  barriers,  working  out these barriers is all  it 
    takes to be on the road to success.

       Some   may   be  disturbed  to  think  that  magick   may   be 
    misrepresenting  how it works,  but that should not be a problem. 
    In  one  experiment,  scientists  gave placebos  to  a  group  of 
    3273

    subjects.  After  the  placebos  "took  effect,"  the  scientists 
    explained what they were.  Even when the scientists made it clear 
    to the subjects that the placebos had no biochemical action, many 
    subjects  still  wanted  a prescription for them.  (It  would  be 
    interesting to see how much more effective prescription  placebos 
    are  versus over the counter placebos.) Were these people stupid? 
    Or were they wise to stick with something that worked? 

                               New Science

       Those  that  cannot extricate themselves from old  mechanistic 
    views  need an excuse to allow the placebo effect to  bring  them 
    success.  Ironically,  the  same discipline which made magick  so 
    difficult  can now provide this excuse.  Scientists are exploring 
    some  new  ideas  which  depart  from  the  founding  mechanistic 
    paradigm.  Ideas consonant with the magickal paradigm show up  in 
    Jung's  synchronicity,  quantum physics,  the Gaia hypothesis and 
    the morphogenetic field hypothesis (see Rupert Sheldrake's "A New 
    Science  of  Life").  When these views  obviously  challenge  the 
    traditional mechanistic paradigm,  they are a source of hostility 
    or  amusement.  When the challenge is more subtle,  people ignore 
    it.  Never the less,  the West is gradually turning toward a view 
    more  in tune with magick.  With greater  frequency,  people  are 
    willing  to consider the idea that we affect our universe on more 
    than just a physical level. 

       Scientific  evidence  now supports the idea of  non-physically 
    affecting  your  environment.  Quantum physics suggests  that  an 
    experimenter's  goals  seem  to  create  whatever  particle  he's 
    looking  for.  The morphogenetic field hypothesis  suggests  that 
    actions   affect  all  other  actions  to  the  degree  that  the 
    circumstances are similar. This explains why it becomes easier to 
    grow  a  certain  type of crystal over time and  how  new  animal 
    behaviors "jump" from one isolated population to another. Science 
    is  continually  finding support for things  that  metaphysicians 
    have said for millennia. 

       If  your  respect  for science is such that  you  cannot  take 
    magick seriously,  do some research into these areas.  If you can 
    find an acceptable explanation, then you can respect magick. This 
    respect  is essential for success.  But don't look for  "proofs." 
    The  concept of magick is nebulous.  It's designed to explain the 
    way  things  are.   "Contrary  evidence"  only  shows  that   you 
    misunderstand.   Change   your  definition  to  include  the  new 
    evidence. 

       Magick  can  never be proven wrong because it can't be  pinned 
    down.  Since  it explains a subjective reality,  it can never  be 
    proven  right,  either.  The magickal paradigm will  confirm  any 
    preconceptions,  so  the mechanistic paradigm will look "true" if 
    that  is  what  you expect.  Since it  also  postulates  so  many 
    unknowns  in the mind,  this paradigm states that what you get is 
    what you expected.  As with so many things,  you will believe  if 
    you  want to and you won't if you don't want to.  But when you're 
    on  the  fence,  the right explanation can help  you  accept  the 
    possibility.  Only  then  you  can honestly try  magick.  If  you 
    experiment with a negative attitude,  it is the nature of  magick 
    to confirm this.  Magick works best for those practical enough to 
    3274

    be skeptical, but open minded enough to give it an honest try. If 
    a  part of you is genuinely interested in magick,  work to become 
    comfortable with it.  Start with simple and harmless work.  Leave 
    the embarrassing stuff for later,  after you've seen it work  and 
    you don't care so much if your friends find out. 

       Avoid  getting too involved in the "explanations." If you need 
    one,  pick whichever you like. It doesn't have to be any of those 
    here.  Each  has to build his own models.  In any  case,  reality 
    transcends  the  understanding of  waking-consciousness,  so  any 
    expressible  explanation  is "wrong" in  the  traditional  sense, 
    anyway.  For  a  good  illustration,  try to  "understand"  wave-
    particle  duality  in  any but  a  mathematical  sense.  It's  as 
    impossible to picture as a four dimensional cube.

       However  the  universe "actually is," always act in  a  manner 
    that  is responsible in an objective universe.  If this were  not 
    essential,  people  would  have abandoned the objective  universe 
    long ago. Objective or subjective, there are many empirical rules 
    of behavior that we all know.  Magick doesn't change these rules. 
    Don't drive crazily because you've done a protection spell. Don't 
    spend unwisely because you've done a prosperity spell. Don't jump 
    off a building because you've done a flight spell.  Remain within 
    these  rules  and  you  loose nothing by  acting  as  though  the 
    universe  is  subjective.  You should not be doing  anything  you 
    don't  want  to  do in the first place,  because  such  acts  are 
    pointless in either universe.  If the universe is objective, then 
    you  have had some harmless fun.  If the universe is  subjective, 
    then  you  have  the chance to get  anything  you  want.  If  you 
    approach it properly, you can't lose.

                      THE EMPIRICAL RULES OF MAGICK

                         Karma, the golden rule

       So far you have read a few possible explanations of how magick 
    works.  This is to open your mind to the fact it *can* work.  But 
    any   explanation  puts  a  limit  on  the   possibilities.   The 
    possibilities  which a model rules out are much harder to achieve 
    while   you  use  that  model.   Please  don't   limit   yourself 
    unnecessarily.  But  remember,  no matter how much you may try to 
    believe  that you can fly,  it's not likely you'll  succeed.  The 
    obvious  lesson  here is,  be careful:  test the waters  of  your 
    subconscious, act responsibly (but not over cautious). Don't jump 
    off a cliff after your first flight spell.  Don't quit work after 
    your  first job spell.  Start slow and find out how  your  Little 
    Self works before you do any life changing work.

       There  is  a hazard so universal that you should treat  it  as 
    fact:  Karma.  This is the old saw of,  "what goes around,  comes 
    around."  You  attract  things of a similar nature  to  what  you 
    concentrate  on (similar to morphogenetic fields).  And remember, 
    when  you concentrate on something,  your Little Self does so  at 
    least  as  much.  The  mechanistic reason for this  may  be  "the 
    subconscious  mind  directing  subtle  actions  to  bring   about 
    circumstances  in  tune with its thoughts." Metaphysicians  often 
    explain it as "like vibrations attracting like."

    3275

       Everything has a "vibration." This is similar to the vibration 
    of musical notes,  though obviously not the same. As with musical 
    notes,  one  vibration  can start a  sympathetic  vibration.  One 
    vibrating  piano  string  will start similar  strings  vibrating. 
    Karma  is  the  word for this principle in  magick.  There  is  a 
    certain  vibration associated with any act.  If you hit  someone, 
    the  emotions  and actions involved are of a  certain  vibration. 
    This  will  tend  to  attract  things  of  a  similar  vibration, 
    primarily violent acts.  You will tend to attract someone to  hit 
    you.   It  turns  out  that  everything  you  do  to  others  you 
    essentially also do to yourself, and vice versa. It sounds trite, 
    but  being  nice to others and yourself truly makes the  world  a 
    better place for everyone.

       It  doesn't  matter how you understand karma,  or even if  you 
    believe in it-- you are warned.  Many people  don't  believe. The 
    action of karma,  particularly on such people,  is often too slow 
    to  notice.  It  can  easily take lifetimes for a  soul  to  work 
    through karma.  But the soul will, so avoid bad thoughts. This is 
    impossible,   but  you  will  get  better  with  practice.   Each 
    unpleasant thought has a negative effect on you and others.  This 
    brings negative things into your life. This is pretty rotten, but 
    remember that each positive thought brings positive things-- that 
    can  be pretty good.  In any case,  you needn't respect karma  to 
    find yourself a happier person for trying to live this way.
     
       If  you are just learning about karma,  you will probably find 
    that it is now a little more obvious in your life.  But sometimes 
    it's difficult to figure.  If you do a spell to heal someone, you 
    would  expect  to  be  attracting  good  things.   But  what   if 
    immediately  afterward  you receive a transfer back home to  live 
    near your scummy relatives?  Hardly fair!  Yet that's the kind of 
    result  you  can expect if you do anything to  a  person  without 
    permission.  People  have enough difficulty with their own Little 
    Selves,  it's  nearly impossible to divine the desire of  someone 
    else's.  The most beneficent act could violate someone's will  on 
    some  level.  If the person asks you,  then you are free to  act. 
    But,  even  if you are absolutely sure that the person would want 
    it, if he hasn't asked you, don't do it. 

       Another  fantastic  example is the love spell.  Do a spell  to 
    attract  the  kind of person you want,  not  a  specific  person. 
    Exercising  your  will on others without their consent is  always 
    nasty--  doing  so  magickally has  an  even  higher  cost. Watch 
    yourself.   Many  people  working  with  magick  do  so  under  a 
    "threefold law." This means that any karmic response is  tripled. 
    This  is  to  keep people particularly scrupulous when  they  are 
    fooling around with this stuff. Take it seriously.

                              Know Thyself

       Karma is best described by the golden rule, "Do unto others as 
    you  would have them do unto you." The other major rule of magick 
    is  just  as  common place,  "Know thyself."  This  is  essential 
    because of the Little Self.  Magick is the science of  expressing 
    your  will.  Because  there  are many aspects to  your  will,  it 
    follows  that  you must be aware of all these aspects  to  be  an 
    effective magician.
    3276

       "Know  thyself" means be aware of the thoughts and feelings of 
    your Little Self.  Learn how it feels about the things you  want. 
    Learn  it's  beliefs.  You  must  know  your  starting  point  to 
    effectively change negative beliefs.  To do this, you have to pay 
    attention  to  all  the subconscious cues that your  Little  Self 
    gives you. Explore your feelings, keep track of your dreams, look 
    at  your past.  One of the best clues is your own  life.  If  you 
    create  everything on some level,  then part of you "wants"  each 
    thing in your life. You must not deny this, but work with it. The 
    goal is healing because destruction is at best temporary. 

       Different   desires  on  other  levels  interfere  with   your 
    conscious desire.  Your Little Self picks them up everywhere. You 
    must be aware of this so that you can counteract it.  Every ideal 
    commonly  in  the  mass media  impresses  itself  strongly.  When 
    Madison  Avenue  spreads  the word that young and  thin  are  the 
    ideal,  your Little Self will accept this if you are not careful. 
    If you are not young and thin, this message undermines your sense 
    of  self worth.  The resultant sense of undeserving works against 
    your success. There is so much exposure to these messages that it 
    is a real battle to avoid them.  Particularly in childhood,  when 
    we can't protect ourselves,  others deeply ingrain ideas that can 
    be  with  us  for life.  You must work  hard  to  discover  these 
    feelings and counter act them.  If part of you feels undeserving, 
    genuine success seems impossible.

       There  are other aspects to this problem.  Not only might  you 
    feel  undeserving,  but you could even desire failure.  There are 
    many reasons for this,  usually based in childhood.  Whatever the 
    cause,  you  must look at your failures to see if there might  be 
    some  reward.  Many people are subject to  chronic  illness,  for 
    instance,  because  of  the attention they get or  an  unpleasant 
    situation  they avoid.  If you really want to succeed,  you  must 
    consciously release your desire for the rewards of failure.

       You  must also look at the fear of success.  Many times we  do 
    not  consider  the problems associated with what we are  striving 
    for,  but  the  Little  Self  does.  It  may  be  afraid  of  the 
    responsibility  of a better job or a new  spouse.  Think  through 
    your  goals  very carefully.  What would life be like if you  had 
    what  you  desire?  You will have to address any  new  tasks  and 
    responsibilities.  You  will have to be aware of any  sacrifices. 
    Once  you  are  sure that you want not only your  goal,  but  the 
    sacrifices  and responsibilities that go with  it,  then  release 
    your fears.  People fear change,  because it is unknown. You must 
    be aware that you are taking a leap and welcome it. Have faith in 
    your Self.  When you know your Little Self well enough,  you will 
    be able to trust that it will bring you what you desire. When you 
    don't know it that well,  work on that. If you fail, it's time to 
    work harder.

       When  you  and your Little Self have the same goals,  and  you 
    have healed all the blocks to your success,  you *know* that what 
    you want is coming.  When you know, you do not feel desperate. If 
    you are feeling desperation, you are blocking. In that case, back 
    to work! When you have worked hard enough, then you are ready for 
    the  easy part,  the spell or ritual.  When you enter ritual  you 
    should  know what you want and why you want it.  You should  have 
    3277

    healed  all  feelings of failure and undeserving and  you  should 
    know  that  your  spell will bring it.  Work  to  cultivate  this 
    feeling of calm expectation,  it is an important key. When you do 
    a ritual, you will release all the power you have built to do its 
    work on the universe.  You should not even have to think about it 
    again.

       Once you achieve this,  though,  there is another caveat. Many 
    people  have  something  unpleasant  happen  to  them  and  later 
    realized  that  they had asked for it.  "Be careful what you  ask 
    for,  you  just might get it." Always think carefully about  what 
    you  want and how you ask for it.  Once again,  solid  background 
    work is the key.

                              USING MAGICK
        
       Magick  is a field with many different disciplines.  There  is 
    sympathetic,  Earth,  Ceremonial,  Enochian, Celtic, Egyptian and 
    Kabbalah  magick just to begin.  These are occasionally different 
    in their basic techniques,  but mostly they differ in the symbols 
    they  use to achieve their goals.  The principles are  the  same, 
    however.  Whichever form you prefer,  it is how you observe these 
    principles that determines your success.  Beyond that, it is only 
    personal preference. 

       Preference is very important, too. It is your Little Self that 
    you  are  addressing,  and it is as individual as you.  You  must 
    learn what works best for you.  The first clue is what appeals to 
    you most.  Once you find the best methods for you, you build your 
    own  personal  magickal system.  It is up to you  to  find  these 
    methods,  through research and experimentation.  There is so much 
    information  that  it  is impossible to give more than  a  sample 
    here.  The information in this book is enough to get started.  It 
    is  your work that will complete it.  If you are happy with  what 
    you get on your own,  you need never open another book.  But  you 
    must  at  least pay constant,  careful attention to your work  to 
    fine tune it.  As with anything,  the more work you put  in,  the 
    better your success.

       The  first  principle  is  to  take  what  you're  doing  very 
    seriously.  This  is  not  so easy when  you're  struggling  with 
    society's  negative attitudes.  Ignore any intrusive thoughts you 
    might have. Concentrate on what you are doing. You must passively 
    avoid  any distractions.  Do not try to actively avoid  them  for 
    that  usually becomes an even bigger distraction.  As long as you 
    enter with the right attitude, the rest will come with practice.

       Magickal ritual is a very special thing. You must set it apart 
    from your ordinary functions.  When you do this, your Little Self 
    is aware that you have that an important message to give it.  Not 
    only  is  the message less cluttered by stray  thoughts,  but  it 
    proceeds  more  directly  to the Little Self.  The  more  special 
    things  you have surrounding your ritual,  the more effective  it 
    is. (As long as you don't have so much that these things become a 
    distraction in themselves.)

       Pick  a time when you are relaxed and awake and not under  the 
    influence  of any drugs (e.g.,  alcohol or medication).  Take the 
    3278

    phone off the hook and see that you are not disturbed.  Create  a 
    "sacred  space"  that  is only for ritual.  If you can set  up  a 
    regular  time  or  place which you use  for  nothing  other  than 
    ritual, this is ideal.

       Before you begin,  take a bath or at least wash your hands and 
    use  this  to  symbolically  wash away  all  other  thoughts  and 
    distractions  in  your mind.  Relax your body  and  mind.  Remove 
    watches  and tight clothes.  Make sure the time of the ritual  is 
    clearly  separated from your usual day.  Use a symbolic act  like 
    knocking three times to open and close the ritual.  Anything that 
    you  can add to the ambience will help:  incense,  special or  no 
    clothing,  candle light, silence or meditative music (or whatever 
    music  is appropriate to the spell-- be careful of  any lyrics!). 
    If  you  know a second language that you don't ordinarily  speak, 
    such as hebrew or latin, you may want to use this. Alternatively, 
    you can use the Thee's and Thou's of archaic english.

       During the ritual,  concentrate on your goals.  Make sure that 
    your ritual is not so long that you can't keep your mind focused! 
    It  is better to repeat a ritual over days or weeks than to  have 
    an  enormously  long  one in which you spend most  of  your  time 
    thinking  about balancing your checkbook.  Know what you will  do 
    before  you  start.  You  may ad lib,  but your purpose  must  be 
    completely clear before you start.  Don't be surprised,  however, 
    if  a  ritual  goes  differently  from  expected.  You  may,  for 
    instance,  gain  an insight as you work that seems  unrelated  to 
    your goal. It is important to consider this! It may be the key to 
    what you are trying to achieve.  It may also be a distraction, so 
    be aware.

                              The Attitude

       Since  magick  is the science of controlling  your  Self,  the 
    entire  key is in attitude.  Not only must you take it seriously, 
    but you must also cultivate the right feelings. You must want and 
    expect your goal.
       
       Wanting seems easy, but this is deceptive. That is because the 
    many  facets  of a personality often want different  things.  You 
    must unify your desire just as you must unify your will. A person 
    who grew up abused may learn,  on some level,  to associate  this 
    with  love.  That person's Little Self will seek out abuse as  an 
    expression  of  love.  It will want abuse even if the  individual 
    does not.  Changing the desire of the Little Self to that if  the 
    individual is the challenge.
      
       An even bigger challenge is that of expectation.  According to 
    the  magickal paradigm,  you not only get what you want,  but you 
    get it in the way that you expect it. Thus, if you do a spell for 
    money  and  you  think "I'll never win the  lottery,"  the  money 
    cannot  come that way.  If the spell is to work,  the money  must 
    come from another source, such as finding a better job. Too often 
    we rule out all possibility.  When you do a spell,  you know that 
    has already worked.  If you do not know this,  it has not worked. 
    This is the ideal.  It may well take some time before you work up 
    to this point.

    3279

       For  these reasons it's usually best to start slow.  Remember, 
    to be completely successful, you have to want and expect on every 
    level. Begin with a project easier than levitation! Work your way 
    up  to  something  life  changing  only  after  you  have  proven 
    yourself.  And don't look for dramatic results.  Don't rule  them 
    out, of course-- you can win the lottery or even have ET hand you 
    a  suitcase of money.  But remember,  this is dealing in what you 
    believe,  and  people  rarely believe that  dramatic  things  can 
    happen to them. 

       Look at magick as an extra push-- something to make the random 
    events break your way.  In addition to magickal means, strive for 
    your goals on the earthly level. Preliminary results usually tend 
    toward  things  like improved success in your ordinary  pursuits: 
    business picking up,  a bonus,  getting that job interview. Also, 
    the energy you put into these mundane efforts also supports  your 
    magickal work.  Even if you concentrate on winning a lottery, you 
    must  at  least  buy a ticket.  All your efforts  help  to  build 
    expectation and gives a very strong message to the Little Self. 
                                                                       
                               Affirmation                               

       The message you give to your Little Self is the most important 
    aspect  of Magick.  The whole process is communicating the  right 
    message.  Desire  and  expectancy  are  the  two  most  important 
    messages.  But often these do not get across. The Little Self has 
    the  understanding  of a child.  There are certain messages  that 
    work well and quite a few that work disastrously.  You must learn 
    how to talk to your Little Self.

       The  Little Self understands images and feelings;  it does not 
    understand negatives or time. When you say "I will not fail," the 
    image  in your mind is that of failure.  The message  to  another 
    person  would  be  what you mean,  because  they  understand  the 
    negation,  "not."  The  message  to the subconscious is  "I  will 
    fail." Never,  never,  never use a negative when talking to  your 
    Little Self. 

       If  you  change your message to,  "I will succeed," you  still 
    have a problem. Since the Little Self does not understand time as 
    we  do,  it will perpetually see success as being in the  future. 
    Success  will  never arrive.  The proper  message  would  be,  "I 
    succeed." This is not the way we are used to thinking,  but it is 
    necessary for magickal work. Always formulate your goals this way 
    when you begin a ritual or spell. In addition, the more you think 
    in  this  way  in everyday life,  the more powerful will  be  the 
    positive messages to your Little Self.

                              Visualization

       The  images  which  you give your Little Self  are  even  more 
    important.  It  is  the  images  which your  words  conjure  that 
    actually  do the communicating.  When you choose your  goal,  you 
    should  try  to choose one or more images to  represent  it.  The 
    image must include you in it,  either see yourself in a scene  or 
    picture  it  as  if looking out of your eyes.  The  scene  should 
    represent to you exactly what you desire.

    3280

       The  more  you imagine in your  scene,  the  better.  Details, 
    smells,  sounds  and textures all help enormously.  The scene  is 
    most  effective when it brings up all the emotions that you would 
    feel if you were actually there.  A drawing or picture is a  good 
    aid. Surround yourself with as many things you can find that make 
    you  think of your goal.  Imagine you have what you want and know 
    you have what you want. That is a successful ritual.

                                 Symbols

       Over the millennia, people have discovered symbols which speak 
    to the Little Selves of nearly everyone.  Various sets of symbols 
    form the foundation of the many different schools of magick. They 
    are often culturally oriented. Because our culture is far removed 
    from its magickal symbols,  each must discover his own. There are 
    myriads  of occult books that offer as many different symbols  as 
    you could want.  If you are interested, research them. Look first 
    to your religion or ethnic background for your symbols. Mythology 
    and astrology are also good sources.

       One  kind of symbol is the magickal tool.  This is a  physical 
    object which you have consecrated for magickal work. If you have, 
    for  instance,  a  cross  or  star  which you  want  to  use  for 
    protection,  you  must empower the object for that purpose  in  a 
    ritual.   You  will  direct  you  will,   through  statement  and 
    visualization,  into  to  object.  From then on it is a  constant 
    tangible reminder to you and your Little Self.  Treat it with the 
    greatest respect.

       When you want to use a symbol,  first explore your feelings as 
    you  look at it.  If it conjures the feelings you want,  then use 
    it.  With symbols from a source, try do this before you read what 
    the "authentic" meaning is. Sometimes you can get new information 
    by  not prejudicing yourself.  Be careful if the meaning is  very 
    different,  though.  If  you are not entirely in tune  with  your 
    Little Self (and few beginners are), you may be missing something 
    that will affect your spell.

                                 Chakra
       To  give you an idea of what to look for and a sample to  try, 
    here  is  a simple set of symbols based on  the  Chakra.  Chakrum 
    (singular)  is  Sanskrit for wheel,  although vortex would  be  a 
    better  word.  Chakra refers to points in the body where  certain 
    energies  localize.  These  types of energies correspond to  many 
    different things: herbs, stones, times, planets, moods, political 
    beliefs.  It  is possible to relate anything to a  chakrum.  This 
    chart gives points on the body, one of the many color schemes and 
    how one experiences these energies.  This becomes useful when you 
    seek a reinforcing energy. You can use this chart to decide where 
    to  apply a magickal oil or what color is best to use in a  given 
    project.

    RED       ROOT            Physical Health and Energy
    ORANGE    SPLEEN          Sexual and Reserve Energy (Second Wind)
    YELLOW    SOLAR PLEXUS    Mental and Emotional Energy
    GREEN     HEART           Love, Prosperity, Fertility, Growth
    BLUE      THROAT          Command, Creation, Will, Expression
    INDIGO    BROW            Magick, Psychic Energy
    3281

    LAVENDER  CROWN           Spirituality
    WHITE     Positivity, all colors combined, the Universal Deity (God)
    BLACK     absorbs negativity
    PINK      Filial Love, "Agape" (look it up)
    BROWN     Earthiness, Grounding, Hearth & Home
    GOLD      Wealth
              TEMPLES         Thoughts, mind

    The blue is a very light blue.  Indigo is a very dark blue,  like navy 
    blue.  Lavender is a mixture of the colors and the energies of  red, 
    indigo and white.  It is a very light color  which  you might be able to
    see at the edge of a gas flame. The root chakrum is  at the base of the
    spine.  The spleen is a few inches  higher and  to  your left or along
    the spine (your  choice).  The  Solar Plexus at the navel (there is a
    major nerve nexus here). The Brow or Third Eye Chakrum is associated
    with the pineal gland.  On the skin, the point is on the brow between
    the eyes. The crown is the top of the head,  associated with the
    fontanelle (soft spot).  If you use something black (like obsidian) to
    absorb negativity,  be sure  to wash it occasionally to get rid of the
    negativity.  When you  burn  a black candle,  this creates a vacuum. 
    This  may  be filled  by for negativity unless you also burn a white
    candle  to bring in positive energy. 
                                EXERCISES

       Magick  is  not just an occasional exercise to bring what  you 
    want,  it  is  a  way of life.  It requires  a  certain  kind  of 
    relationship  with your Self.  This does not preclude any kind of 
    life style or religion,  it is entirely separate.  It isn't  what 
    you  do but why and how you do it.  Magick demands that you  love 
    and respect your Self and that you accept your Power. This is the 
    goal. "Getting what you want" is a small bonus.

       Building  a magickal relationship with your Self is much  like 
    building one with a best friend.  You learn all you can about its 
    beliefs  and  feelings.  You help heal it and it helps  you.  You 
    achieve  this through communication and love.  You  love  through 
    learning acceptance. You communicate by learning and listening to 
    the language of the Little Self.

                                 Dreams

       The  Little Self expresses itself most clearly in dreams.  You 
    should  keep a regular dream diary.  Have a journal handy by  the 
    bed.  As soon as you wake up in the morning,  write down as  many 
    details as you can.  If you scribble down notes,  transcribe them 
    into  a clear,  coherent text.  If you remember no dreams,  write 
    this down. You should have an entry for every day that you sleep. 
    It is best to record them in present participle (e.g.,  "I  dream 
    that I am writing in my journal").

       Once  you  have a dream recorded.  Consider it and write  down 
    your  impressions.  How does it make you feel?  To what  does  it 
    pertain?  What  symbols  are there?  What does it tell you  about 
    yourself and your life?  After you have considered these  things, 
    you  may  choose  to  look up the possible  meaning  in  a  dream 
    dictionary.  It  is  best  to do this afterward  because  someone 
    else's interpretation could prejudice your own.  The advantage is 
    that  many dreams are "contrary." Such dreams actually  mean  the 
    3282

    opposite  of what they seem to on the surface.  A dictionary  can 
    help jog your awareness.  Once you've tried on your own, it's not 
    a  bad  idea.  Remember,  though,  your impressions are the  most 
    significant.

       You  can make great progress during your dreams as  well.  The 
    more control you have in your dreams,  the more Power you have in 
    your life. Try to develop this control. Remind yourself each time 
    before  you  go  to bed that you will remember  your  dreams  and 
    exercise your will in them. The ideal is called a waking or vivid 
    dream.  In  this you are consciously aware that you are  dreaming 
    and  everything,  especially  color,  is  very  clear.  The  most 
    important  thing  to remember in a dream is to defeat  everything 
    that attacks you. Attackers represent those things afflicting you 
    during the day.  Don't let them beat you in your dreams.  If  you 
    need help,  call for it.  When victorious, make the attacker give 
    you  a gift.  The gift is the benefit that you can gain from  any 
    situation.  Defeat your dream monsters and you gain power to face 
    your real monsters.

       From  your dreams you can learn what your Little Self  desires 
    and  fears.  You  can also gain powerful symbols for  your  work. 
    These  are all highly personal and it is up to you to divine this 
    information.  But,  don't try to interpret too much. Much of what 
    you  dream is reviewing the events of the day and other items  of 
    no great insight. Look at all your dreams and discover which ones 
    hold meaning for you. Don't worry when you don't understand. Your 
    Little  Self will keep trying when it has something important  to 
    tell you. As long as you keep listening, you will progress.

                                  Diary

       You should also keep a daily diary.  It too, is a line to your 
    Little  Self.  Use this to record the events of the day and  your 
    thoughts and feelings. These will reflect what is going on inside 
    you.  Use  it also for introspection.  You must do a lot of  soul 
    searching to learn about your Little Self, this is most effective 
    when written. 

       It  is  even  more  important to track the  progress  of  your 
    magickal  work.  Each time you do a spell or ritual  record  your 
    goal, your feelings before and after and your methods. Before you 
    get  to  this  point,  you  should also have  explored  all  your 
    feelings  associated with it.  Then pay careful attention to  all 
    that  happens  to you (part of the reason for the  daily  diary). 
    Often, a spell will work and we will not even notice.

       Since magick works with what we believe,  things come to us in 
    the way we expect or allow.  When you do a healing,  it will tend 
    to  look entirely natural,  rather than miraculous.  If you do  a 
    prosperity  spell,  receiving  a tax refund check  the  following 
    month  could be the universe's response.  Keep an eye out for any 
    hint  of possible results.  Even the weakest indication  is  very 
    positive.  It may not be enough to satisfy, but it means that you 
    are  being effective.  If you keep working,  you will be able  to 
    improve  until you achieve the result you desire.  When you  give 
    yourself  credit  for even the smallest success,  you  build  the 
    relationship between you and your Little Self.
    3283

                                Pendulums

       Another  good  way of communicating with your Little  Self  is 
    through pendulum work. You can use any object on a string, but if 
    it holds significance for you,  so much the better. Hold your arm 
    steady and think about the pendulum swinging forward and back. It 
    should eventually begin to do so without you *consciously* moving 
    your arm.  Next change the movement to left and right by thinking 
    about it. Once you can do this with facility, assign "yes" to one 
    direction  and "no" to the other.  If you choose forward and back 
    as "yes," alternate thinking the direction and thinking the word. 
    Eventually,  even  when you start cold,  the pendulum will  swing 
    forward and back when you think "yes." Repeat with the word  "no" 
    for  the opposite direction.  Now you have a way of talking  with 
    your Little Self. You can ask it questions directly.

       Eventually,  you  can even get your Little Self to spell words 
    by  holding the pendulum over a semicircle with the  alphabet  on 
    it.  The  direction of swing will indicate each  letter.  Another 
    method  is automatic writing.  With this you hold a pen and relax 
    and let "it" do the writing. (This may sound like an Ouija board, 
    but  it is not.  Do not try to use one for this purpose  or  vice 
    versa.)  Whatever method you use,  be careful.  Your Little  Self 
    wants  to  please you.  It will tend to give you the  answer  you 
    want.  Make  sure  you want the truth and that your  Little  Self 
    understands this.  Always be friendly, as you would with a child. 
    Praise  success and don't berate failure.  After all,  it is only 
    trying to please. As usual, this requires regular work over time, 
    but  eventually you can have such a good understanding  that  you 
    need no tools. You will simply "know" how your Little Self feels. 
    This is the ideal.

                               Meditation

       Another  way to achieve this awareness is through  meditation. 
    This  is  a  method of calming the  conscious  mind.  There  many 
    physical benefits from the stress reduction alone. It also allows 
    your  inner thoughts and feelings to express themselves.  All the 
    skills  you learn in meditation are very useful  in  magick.  Not 
    only  is it a line of communication with the little self,  but it 
    teaches  you  to quiet the conscious mind which is  essential  in 
    ritual.  You  would  do  well take instruction  in  a  meditation 
    technique such as yoga or self-hypnosis.

       If  you  are learning this on your own,  observe these  rules: 
    Relax  your  body consciously and completely.  You must be  in  a 
    comfortable,  calm environment to do this properly.  Starting  at 
    your  feet,  think about each part of your body and let it relax. 
    It may help to tighten the muscles first.  Use a cue to tell your 
    mind  to relax.  This can be something like mentally  going  down 
    stairs  or  counting backwards.  [Do not use a  common  cue.  For 
    instance, "three, two, one" is something that you might encounter 
    on the radio while driving.  This could be dangerous. It would be 
    better to use,  "three,  three,  three,  two, two, two, one, one, 
    one."  This is less likely to cause a problem.  It is dangerously 
    easy  to get into a meditative state during automatic tasks  like 
    driving.  This  you must avoid.] Once relaxed,  you can use  this 
    state to allow subconscious thoughts to float to the surface,  or 
    3284

    you  can  use  it in ritual to give a powerful  message  to  your 
    Little Self. This mental state is another key to magick.

       You  will  find  that  it  is very  difficult  to  focus  your 
    conscious  mind at first.  See how long you can hold one word  or 
    picture in your head without any other thought. It is probably an 
    astoundingly  brief  time.  Watch  commercials to  see  how  many 
    seconds  they  show one unchanging  scene.  This  represents  the 
    average attention span. This is one of the reasons that magick is 
    so difficult,  you must remain focused for the entire ritual.  Be 
    aware of you concentration span. While it is short, you should be 
    working  short  rituals.  It is better to have three  five-minute 
    rituals than one half-hour ritual if you spend twenty minutes  of 
    the latter thinking of other things.

       In  order to improve your concentration,  spend some time each 
    day trying to hold a word or picture as long as possible. Another 
    good exercise is to pick a word and try *not* to think of it  for 
    a week.  Count how many times you think the word in your head, if 
    you  think it again when counting it,  count that instance,  too. 
    This is very difficult,  but eventually you will even be able  to 
    hear or see the word without thinking it.

       These  skills immediately become useful in communicating  with 
    your Little Self.  You will want to hold positive thoughts,  such 
    as "I am a loveable,  successful person." You will want to dispel 
    negative  thoughts,  as  when the T.V.  tells you,  "I  was  very 
    unpopular  until I started using Crealm Toothpaste!" When you are 
    trying to reprogram your Little Self,  feel free to use aids such 
    as  subliminal tapes.  Another good one is colored  cards.  Place 
    your simple,  direct message,  such as "I succeed," on a  colored 
    card where you will see it each day. Put small pieces of the same 
    color where you will encounter them throughout the day. Each time 
    a bit of card comes in your field of view,  your Little Self will 
    notice and remember the message, even when you don't.

       Symbolic acts are also very powerful.  When you clean out your 
    house  and get rid of everything that you don't *need,* you  make 
    way  for new things to come into your life.  This is a good thing 
    to  do  in concert with a major change  in  your  life,  quitting 
    smoking or graduation, for instance. It helps to tell your Little 
    Self  that your old life is over and your new one has begun.  The 
    more you can eliminate the symbols of your old life, the more you 
    can shape your new life to your liking.  Be aware of all that you 
    do, for you can use ordinary acts to give messages to your Little 
    Self. Your morning shower can be a ritual to "wash away" all your 
    stress or yesterday's mistakes. If you do this, however, you must 
    *make*  it  a ritual.  Develop a routine and concentrate  on  the 
    purpose  of  the act throughout.  This is true  of  all  magickal 
    works.

       Once you have begun this work to focus your conscious mind and 
    reprogram  your Little Self for success,  then you can begin some 
    small  works  of magick.  You want to start  small  because  most 
    people have difficulty accepting a great success on a deep level. 
    If  start with a spell to win one million in the lottery and  you 
    are not ready for this, your failure will set you back. If you do 
    prosperity  spell  and  you get a small raise or win $10  in  the 
    3285

    lottery, that is a start that you can build on.

       One   of   the  better  starting  goals  is   manifesting   an 
    insignificant  object.  Manifesting  means bringing it into  your 
    life.  Things  tend to manifest in unremarkable ways,  so keep  a 
    look out. The blue feather is a classic. Set up a ritual in which 
    you concentrate on a blue feather.  See it,  feel it,  smell  it, 
    want  it,  then let it go.  Then pay attention for the  following 
    week  (and  keep  track in your journal).  You may  find  a  blue 
    feather  on the side walk.  You may notice one for the first time 
    on a billboard that you pass every day.  You may see one on  T.V. 
    All of these are successes. 
       
       It  is  best to start with insignificant,  uncommon  (but  not 
    rare) objects.  An uncommon object gives you a good indication of 
    success.  A  rare  object is a challenge you can work up  to.  An 
    insignificant   object  is  easier  because  you  do   not   have 
    interfering  desires  or  fears.  You  have  to  be  relaxed  and 
    confident  and let go of your desire as you complete the  ritual. 
    You  should be able to manifest such an object before you proceed 
    to  a greater challenge.  It is valuable to repeat this  exercise 
    every so often in any case.

       Another good spell to start with is a spell to do good spells. 
    That is,  you can use magic to help remove blocks and fears.  For 
    instance,  if  you have discovered that you feel  unworthy,  this 
    will  seriously  impair your ability to manifest what  you  want. 
    But,  you  can use your desire for self worth to empower magickal 
    work  toward  feeling  worthiness.  You can also do  a  spell  to 
    support your ability to concentrate on your goal. This is just an 
    extension  of all the other methods of getting messages  to  your 
    Little Self.

       When you discover blocks and fears,  when thoughts intrude and 
    your  mind  wanders,  or when you find yourself thinking  exactly 
    what you're supposed to avoid,  don't worry!  This happens as you 
    learn  to  control  your will.  The idea is not  to  avoid  these 
    problems,  but  to *learn* to avoid them.  You can't do  this  by 
    trying to force yourself.  There are no instructions on how to do 
    this,  only  exercises.  Just  do  your stuff and the  rest  will 
    follow.  When problem surfaces, recognize it and go on. Don't try 
    to  stop it and don't dwell on it,  just continue.  You may  know 
    that  you  have  "spoiled" a ritual with  a  stray  thought,  but 
    complete it anyway-- it's a good exercise. Sometimes you can deal 
    with stray thoughts by *trying* to think about them.  Concentrate 
    on these thoughts and let your mind tire of them, then go on with 
    your work.

       Work  steadily,  but not overly hard,  on these exercises  and 
    make magick a part of your life.  Unify your will. Take and prove 
    your  Power.  Only  after you have done this are you ready to  do 
    magick.  When  you feel you are ready,  develop the messages  and 
    visualization which will be the most powerful for you. Decide how 
    you  are  going  to  set up your ritual area  and  how  you  will 
    orchestrate your spell.  Whatever you feel best with is what will 
    be  the  most  powerful.  If you need an idea of  how  to  start, 
    consider the examples that follow.

    3286


                                 SPELLS

       Once  you have discovered and addressed your blocks,  you  are 
    ready  to do a spell.  This is only a little different from  what 
    you have already been doing.  In a spell you do nothing new,  you 
    do it differently.  A spell is a ritual, an act carefully planned 
    to have the greatest effect.  You must do the planning,  for only 
    you  know what will be the most effective ritual.  Plan carefully 
    and completely. You may want to use a script (it would be best to 
    memorize  it).  You can ad lib once you're more  experienced.  At 
    this point,  you have enough information to develop more powerful 
    rituals  than you are likely to encounter in any  book.  However, 
    since this is so different from what most of us are used to, here 
    are some samples to give you a starting point.  Feel free to  use 
    and change these rituals as you please. They are here to give you 
    an idea of how you may want to approach things. 

       The  ritual starts in a special place.  It could be out in the 
    woods  or in a special room.  Ideally,  you would never use  this 
    place for anything but ritual,  but this may be impossible. If in 
    the  home,  choose a quiet time and unplug the phone.  Make  sure 
    that you are not disturbed.

       Before  the ritual,  carefully clean and arrange the area  and 
    take a bath or wash your hands. Think about washing away the days 
    thoughts and cares. You are now ritually purified. You should not 
    engage in any mundane activity until after the ritual. Enter your 
    ritual  area and knock three times,  to mark the beginning.  From 
    this point all your thoughts are on the ritual. Don't do anything 
    automatically.  No matter how familiar,  think about every action 
    and what it means. 

       Light  candles  and  incense (only if there is  no  danger  of 
    fire!).  Imagine  the ritual area surrounded in a circle of white 
    light.  You  may  physically trace this circle to  reinforce  it. 
    (Traditionally,  all  such movements are clockwise when  invoking 
    and   counterclockwise  when  dispelling.)  Repeat  an   act   of 
    purification.  This is like the bath only more symbolic.  You can 
    hold your hand in the incense smoke and touch water from a ritual 
    cup to your forehead, for instance. Next, relax and aum-- that is 
    chant  the  mantra "ohhmmm" (or whatever works for you) to  bring 
    your  mind  to the proper state of alert  relaxation,  ready  for 
    work.

       At this point you will state your will. Tell your Self and the 
    Universe   how  you  choose  it  to  be.   This  is  not   merely 
    verbalization,  during ritual your word is law. What you say, is. 
    Feel your statement with your entire being, with every sense. Use 
    all the techniques that you have found effective.  Then,  let the 
    feeling go. It is going out into the universe to do its work. End 
    your  expression with a statement like,  "According to free  will 
    and  for  the  good of all." This helps to  avoid  problems  with 
    karma,  as  long as you mean it.  Do not allow other thoughts  to 
    intrude at this point, it is now time to close the ritual. 

       Imagine  removing  the white light circle  (counterclockwise). 
    Knock three times to end the ritual.  Put out the candles,  clean 
    3287

    each  item  and put it carefully away in  a  special  place.  The 
    ritual  is  only  finished once you have completed all  of  these 
    steps. Only then can you resume thinking about what's on the T.V. 
    and how big a jerk your boss it. As a beginner, you should always 
    be prepared to go through this entire procedure before you start. 
    Even in an emergency, you should at least remove the white circle 
    and knock (very quickly,  perhaps, but do at least this much when 
    possible).  Nothing in a ritual is mundane, so it must be clearly 
    delineated from your mundane actions.  Otherwise you will  dilute 
    your spell and give the wrong messages to your Little Self.  When 
    ritual is obviously separate,  your Little Self will know when to 
    pay close attention.

       Once finished, do not talk about your work. Silence is another 
    important key to magick. If you discuss it with anyone else, they 
    cannot  help  adding  their  thoughts.   This  is  almost  always 
    detrimental.  It is fine to work with people,  then your energies 
    multiply.  But  never  talk about specific spells that  you  have 
    done.

                         Destroying Your Enemies

       This  is one aspect of magick that attracts many.  It is a big 
    mistake! Karma will get you every time. Don't try to rationalize. 
    Though you may be able to put it off,  you will not escape karma. 
    In the mundane world,  you might justifiably do violence in order 
    to  defend yourself or another from physical attack.  In  magick, 
    this justifies only defense, never attack. Don't imagine yourself 
    to  be  an agent of karma or a martyr saving others at  your  own 
    expense.  Who  ever  has  done  you  wrong  will  get  his.  It's 
    frustrating to wait and we all want to be there when it  happens, 
    but it is never worth trying to make it happen. 

       When  you  have  any  kind  of  relationship,  particularly  a 
    magickal  one,  you develop a karmic tie.  You will want to avoid 
    such ties with people you don't like. Even if you get the best of 
    such  a person,  he will still drag you down.  It's difficult  to 
    resist when you feel that the person owes you.  If you have  been 
    swindled  and left with no legal recourse,  it's tempting to  use 
    magick to get your money back.  Trying to get even will develop a 
    tie  with this person and probably set you up for some bad karma. 
    Don't  worry  about the money,  either.  You can  get  that  from 
    anywhere (see "Prosperity"), In seeing this swindler as your only 
    source  you  give your Power to him.  If you are brave,  you  can 
    demand justice in such a situation.  This incurs no karmic  debt, 
    but you,  too, can expect justice. Not very many people genuinely 
    want  this.  Most prefer mercy because we have all done plenty of 
    things  that  we would rather not have to pay for.  If  you  want 
    mercy,  you must extend it to others.  When you ask for  justice, 
    all your debts present themselves.  If you survive, great, but it 
    won't  be  fun.  There are much safer ways of dealing with  nasty 
    people.

                               Protection

       Psychic  attack  can  be  a  real problem  because  it  is  so 
    prevalent.  When you make someone angry,  the person is attacking 
    you.  Simply directing angry thoughts is a psychic attack.  (This 
    3288

    incurs bad karma,  so learn to avoid this yourself!) We all  have 
    natural defenses,  so these attacks seldom have an effect. But if 
    someone has ability,  or if he concentrates a lot of energy,  you 
    are likely to suffer. Psychic attack usually comes in through the 
    neck  and  manifests  as  a headache.  As  you  become  a  better 
    magician,  you will be more sensitive to the energies around you. 
    You  become  more vulnerable to psychic attack.  You also  become 
    better able to defend yourself as long as you remain alert.  This 
    work  will also help protect you from physical threats.  Keep  in 
    mind that, though magic may help, you must still act responsibly!

    Affirmations:  I am now safe and secure.  All negative influences 
    are  reflected off me into the Earth to be healed.  I allow  only 
    the positive into my life.

    Visualizations:  See  an egg of white light around  you-- because 
    this  keeps  in negative energy,  also see it filled with  violet 
    light,  which  will turn the negative to positive.  Another  good 
    visualization is three concentric circles around you (or whatever 
    you wish to protect) of white (outside),  blue (middle) and  pink 
    (inside).  Also, you can imagine a mirror at the back of the neck 
    or encasing the whole body, reflecting outward.

    Other: Religious symbols are especially good for this work. 

                              Purification

       Remember  that the things you have in your life are those that 
    you have drawn to you.  When someone upsets you, he usually has a 
    lesson to teach you. If you can learn this lesson, you can escape 
    the situation. If you escape without learning your lesson, you'll 
    probably be in a similar situation soon.  Sometimes people  often 
    make us angry by reflecting a part of our personality that we are 
    unhappy with. Also, the negative vibrations we pick up during our 
    everyday lives attract negative things. The purpose of the ritual 
    bath  is to remove such influences.  It is also a good idea to do 
    an entire spell for purification.  This is not only good to do on 
    yourself,  but  also your home and wherever else you  spend  much 
    personal time.

    Affirmations:  The  white  light  cleanses  me  of  all  negative 
    thoughts  and energies.  Only positive feelings remain in  me.  I 
    release all negative vibrations into the Earth to be healed.

    Visualizations:  See  yourself  being  washed clean by  white  or 
    violet  light  from above you (your High  Self).  Each  time  you 
    inhale,  take in pure white light.  When you exhale,  release all 
    your negativity. See this negativity go down into the earth to be 
    healed.

    Other:  Place a piece of rock salt under your tongue. Use incense 
    smoke or water to cleanse yourself.  Again, religious symbols are 
    very effective.

                                  Love

       You  must take love spells very seriously,  for they are quite 
    dangerous.  Never, never, never do a love spell on an individual. 
    3289

    This  is  often  a great temptation,  but  don't  even  risk  the 
    possibility of imposing your will on another.  The karmic results 
    are  severe.  Even  if you succeeded,  you would still lack  real 
    love,  for you would have to continually renew the spell to  keep 
    the person. What you want, among other things, is someone to help 
    express your love for yourself.  As you will often hear, you must 
    love yourself first.  This isn't a problem,  for you already love 
    yourself-- that is the main reason you are alive.  The problem is 
    when you block that love.  Eliminating these blocks is the Soul's 
    goal. But don't despair, you needn't actually remove them to draw 
    love  to  you.  Just beginning the work can attract that  special 
    someone who will help. 

    Affirmations:  I  am  a perfect manifestation of love and I  draw 
    love  to me.  I now allow love to come into my life.  I feel  and 
    express perfect love and draw other loving people into my life.

    Visualizations: Picture yourself as a magnet, feeling and drawing 
    love.  Imagine  yourself bathed in green or pink or orange light, 
    depending on your goals.  Pink is for filial love (agape) and for 
    that  of  a  lover.  Orange  is for  the  sexual  aspect  (spleen 
    chakrum). Green is for both (heart chakrum). But the distinctions 
    are somewhat blurred, for love is a combination of all of these. 

    Other:  Friday is the day of Venus and the waxing to full Moon is 
    a  time  of increase,  so these are good times  for  ritual.  The 
    ubiquitous heart symbol can be useful.

                               Prosperity

       Money is not all there is to prosperity.  What do you want the 
    money  for?  What kind of life do you want to live?  What do  you 
    want to have?  Keep these goals in mind. You may get them instead 
    of the money.

       As  you  work  though  your blocks  to  prosperity,  you  will 
    probably  find  that one of the biggest  is  guilt.  Our  society 
    functions under the assumption that a person can only gain at the 
    expense  of  others.  Don't  try to get money by taking  it  from 
    others through force or fraud,  magickally or otherwise.  That is 
    giving  your Power away.  In the magickal paradigm,  you  create. 
    When you understand this,  there is no greed because you can have 
    whatever  you desire and without taking from others.  It  is  not 
    money that is a root of evil,  but the love of money.  It doesn't 
    matter  how  much  you get,  but how you get it.  When you  do  a 
    prosperity  spell,  it  should  be a  joyful  expression  of  the 
    infinite  supply available to you.  If you are begging or hopping 
    to be rescued, you have more background work to do.

       Another aspect to remember is that money, like all other kinds 
    of energy, flows. In order to get it, you have to spend it. There 
    must  be  an outflux for there to be an influx.  This is  not  an 
    excuse  to  be irresponsible!  It is easy for the flow to be  too 
    much in either direction (especially out!).  Don't be miserly  or 
    wasteful,  remember the flow. Use each bill you pay to remind you 
    that  you've  drawn the money to pay it and that more money  will 
    come to take its place.

    3290

    Affirmations: I allow prosperity to manifest itself in my life in 
    great abundance.  I draw from the infinite source all the money I 
    need and more.  In my life,  I now express the infinite supply of 
    wealth around me.

    Visualizations:  Imagine  yourself  bathed in green light  (heart 
    chakrum).   This   is  a  situation  where  visualization   works 
    particularly well,  because it's a tangible object.  You can even 
    use a picture or model of the new home or car you want.

    Other:  Good times for a prosperity ritual are Thursday,  the day 
    for  increase,  and during the waxing Moon.  The $ (or approriate 
    regional symbol) has a great deal of power-- consider using it.

                        Health & Self Improvement

       Your  body is the most direct expression of your Little  Self. 
    It  is  one  of the most accessible,  yet challenging  things  to 
    change.  If  you can find and address the root causes  of  health 
    problems,  like  heat disease,  it is often relatively easy to do 
    something  about  them.  But  self image  problems  can  be  very 
    difficult because of the way our society approaches the subject. 

       Over weight is a good example of a self image problem. Madison 
    Avenue  bombards  us  with  an ideal  of  beauty.  It  is  almost 
    impossible to escape. If you are over weight and unhappy about it 
    for other than health reasons, you are probably a victim of this. 
    It  is dangerously easy to make self love or approval  contingent 
    upon  losing  weight.   Until  you've  lost  it,   you  may  feel 
    undeserving  and  thus fail.  You may succeed,  only to have  old 
    habits  or new crises can throw you back into old eating  habits. 
    You  have  made no fundamental change,  so the  cycle  reinforces 
    itself. So many different problems manifest this way.

       You  will  certainly  want  to deal  with  eating  habits  and 
    exercise,  but this is often insufficient.  People have different 
    metabolic  rates  and different body types.  Do not  make  liking 
    yourself  contingent upon your having a different body  type!  If 
    you  dislike your body,  you dislike your Little Self.  You  must 
    love  yourself  unconditionally.  This is the  same  transcendent 
    spirit expressed in wedding vows:  for better or worse, richer or 
    poorer,  in sickness and in health.  Love yourself not regardless 
    of how you look,  but because of how you look. Wanting to improve 
    doesn't  mean that you must dislike yourself as you are.  If  you 
    were given $900, you wouldn't despise it because it wasn't $1000. 
    Rejoice  in your Little Self's expression of being  alive.  Until 
    you do, this lesson will hang over your head. Ironically, you are 
    most able to change your looks when it matters to you least. 

       Remember to be responsible.  Always get good health care. When 
    trying to lose weight,  follow a sane plan under a doctor's care. 
    But  in addition,  work to love yourself unconditionally.  Strive 
    constantly to fight the messages from the media and those  around 
    you.  You  are a loving,  loveable person and your looks  reflect 
    this.  Make  yourself aware of that.  When you succeed,  you  may 
    eventually look like your ideal,  but even if you don't, you will 
    see  the  beauty  in yourself.  You will be more able  to  defend 
    yourself from those small minds unhappy enough to attack you  for 
    3291

    not  conforming to their ideal.  You will also draw those who can 
    see  your beauty.  As an extreme example,  anorexics always  feel 
    that  they are too fat.  They cannot lose more weight,  for  that 
    would kill them. The answer lies with truly seeing themselves. 

       Any  time your goal is self improvement,  the principle is the 
    same.  In order to better yourself,  you must first realize  that 
    you are loveable, now and always. Never try to better yourself to 
    become loveable-- it doesn't work.  The goal of magick is to heal 
    those things you do not like in yourself,  not destroy them.  You 
    better  yourself by first bettering your self image.  You  change 
    your  behavior by healing the hurts that cause you to do  harmful 
    things.  Recognize  that  all unhappy things are in  response  to 
    pain.  Your Little Self can hurt you,  much as a favorite pet may 
    bite  you because it is in pain.  Do not feel anger or misery but 
    love and healing.

    Affirmations:  I love myself completely as I am now.  I surrender 
    to  love.  I know that I am a loving and loveable person.  I heal 
    all  hurts.  I  now express perfect health in my  life.  I  bring 
    complete health into my life. My body is now a beautiful, healthy 
    expression of my Self.

    Visualizations: Imagine yourself so close to the sun that you can 
    see  nothing else.  Visualize the area you want to heal bathed in 
    blue-green light.  Listen to or imagine the note F#.  Concentrate 
    on  the heart and throat chakra (green and  blue,  respectively). 
    The  root chakrum (red) is another good focus for  physical  well 
    being.  When  healing someone not present,  put a photo next to a 
    candle. Put the name of the subject on the candle and use this to 
    focus your concentration. 

    Other:  Rituals  to increase energy and health are most effective 
    during the waxing moon and at high noon.  Rituals for eliminating 
    disease  or losing weight are best done during the  waning  moon. 
    The  five pointed star (symbol of Man) might be a good symbol (if 
    you do not have any negative associations with it).
                                        

                               Good Luck!

       At this point you are on your own. It takes forty days to make 
    or break a habit, so you should concentrate on daily exercise for 
    at  least this long.  Magick is not a quick,  easy way of getting 
    what  you  want.  It is a long,  hard  road.  Though  it's  quite 
    possible  to  have  instant success,  visible  results  can  take 
    months.  Real rewards can take years. But we all must travel this 
    road  some time.  Be cautious of those promising an easier  path. 
    Though  it may appear slow,  magick is one of the fastest ways of 
    taking your Power.  The difficulty lies not in feats of  physical 
    or mental prowess,  but in steady diligence. Do not try too hard, 
    or you will not last long. If you are not happy with the way your 
    life is going now and you desire to take your power,  then commit 
    to  the life changes which magick demands.  If your commitment is 
    genuine,  then everything will fall into place over  time.  Above 
    all, be patient.

                   Best of luck and stay on the path.
