                                        SPIRITUALITY

                     "What is `spirituality'? Does it matter much today?
              And what is something `sacred'? Is it black and white...or grey?"
                These were the queries of a youngster, and gave me pause for
                                          thought;
               And as I rummaged through my mind, I found the words I sought.
                "Spirituality is a relationship 'twixt the Universe and you,
                  And how you behave will manifest, no matter what you do!

                It's a friendship with creation - with stones and plants and
                                           trees,
                 With birds and deer and butterflies...and even bumblebees;
               It's knowing that the life you have, is found in them, as well;
                    It's awareness that creation is found in every realm,
                    And that all of it is sacred and all of it's divine!
                  That means it's very special - and will be for all time!

              The answers to your questions are both black and white, and grey,
                 As spirituality and sacredness depends on you...each day!"
                   I pondered well his queries as he slipped out the door,
               And wondered if I'd answered well - or if I should say more...
                     But looking out the window, I saw him smile at me,
                And knew that I'd said plenty, as he reached out and hugged a
                                            tree!
