                                           LOVE IS THE LAW 
                                
                       Do what thou wilt is the Whole of the Law 
                       The time of The Will 
                       Bursts forth Now, in the Spring 
                       Implacable bud! 
                        
                       Let your Love burst forth and blossom freely 
                       Thunder of roses 
                       Unfettered by harsh will 
                       Love willed to be Free 
                        
                       To soar with on Her Wings into New Heavens 
                       Over pure New Earths 
                       Love is Will purified 
                       Love is Her own Law! 
                        
                       Sun is born again in primitive Light 
                       With Arian Force 
                       In the Spring House of Mars 
                       New Life Exploding 
                        
                       From cold Winter's Icy dark Womb 
                       Gives force to our Wills 
                       Time of re-SOL-ution 
                       We are born again 
                        
                       Juices of Spring wash us from Winter Womb 
                       As Spring buds push out 
                       We drop from Her belly 
                       Like damp, new born colts 
                        
                       This is the time to re-SOL-ve our new lives 
                       With Nature's Forces 
                       Supporting and healing 
                       As Old Winter dies 

                                                                                               1889
