                                      Magick Vs. Prayer 
            One of the questions brought up on MagickNet was the difference between
         Magick and prayer, and how this ties into the scheme of things in general.
         Well, I feel that prayer and magick are only loosely connected.  In prayer,
         a person pleas with their deity for assistance.  Energy wise, the person
         praying is asking that something be changed, and believes that the request
         will result in a change.  
               In magick, we use ourinner energy, combined with earthly andelemental
         energy and Deity  energy, and send this forth do accomplish the goal of our
         spell.   I  think it's  like  "breaking"  in the  game  of pool.    We  are
         controlling stick  (our spell),  while we  gather the  energy  to push  the
         stick/spell.  Our  Cone Of Power is like the cue ball, and the racked balls
         are the target, which effects a change  (breaks, or the goal of our  spell)
         from the force of our energy.  There may be a point where prayer  becomes a
         type of magick  (or, a psychic event)  if the person knows  of the personal
         energies involved, and releases them with the prayer.
               I feel that aprayer works the opposite way. The prayer is arequest to
         effect a change in the  ambient energy and invoke God (using  the Christian
         form).   This change  in energy  is slower because  it is  "diluted" in the
         surrounding energy and depends solely on faith ("I believe it  will happen,
         so it will"). 
               Am I out  in left field or  just being redundant?   I forgive if  I'm
         "running at the mouth".  Now I'll try and tie in Parapsychology.  Magic and
         psi are very  closely related  in that (aside  for leaving  out the 'k'  in
         magicK)  the  same form  of  energy  is used.    It's just  on  a different
         'frequency'.    When  I  do  an  object  reading  or  empathic  reading  on
         someone/thing,  I'm receiving  a type  of energy.   When I  send a  Cone of
         Power, I'm using the same type of energy, but on a (higher?) wavelength and
         with greater  force and higher  power.   Grounding negative feelings  is an
         example  of  converting one  form  to  the other.    Auric  healing is  the
         opposite.  So,  I feel the  energies are inter-changeable.       I ask,  as
         Elsbeth  has, "What do you  think of THIS?"  As  someone stated before, the
         definitions we are trying to define and  clarify are our own, much like our
         beliefs- our own.  We are trying to find, I believe,  common ground between
         the nuances of our definitions and beliefs.

         Blessed Be!
