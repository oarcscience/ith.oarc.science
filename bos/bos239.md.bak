                                   Consciousness & Politics 

              Below is rough draft overview of my "worldview" as presented in the
              book I'm working on "CONSCIOUSNESS AND POLITICS".  It is definitely
              a "new age" interpretation of epistemology, metaphysics,
              metapsychology, ethics and politics.    Comments welcome.

              EPISTEMOLOGY: (how we find truth)  We must recognize that knowledge
              and truth will always be elusive and subjective.  As Rupert
              Sheldrake points out, even "natural laws" seem to be evolving.
              They are not static and unchanging.  A balance of intuition, reason
              and empirical methods must be applied in seeking knowledge in any
              field, though the appropriate balance of methods will depend on the
              field.  And these can be used to prove that some viewpoints are
              more accurate than others, even if they aren't the "ultimate, final
              truth".
                   Today humans are becoming aware that humans "construct"
              reality, create truth, rather than discovering it.   Reality is not
              some objective, knowable entity created by God or natural law.  It
              is an evolving, ever-changing process.
                   Individuals know reality through their particular
              personal/social/political "psychic grid".  What is important is for
              each of us to decide what psychic grid we choose to work from and
              how to change it if we choose.  Each of us can create
              philosophically/emotionally gratifying reality.  We don't have to
              just go along with what the power structure calls reality.

              METAPHYSICS:  (the nature and purpose of reality)  Consciousness is
              both the nature and the propose of reality.  I choose to call the
              nature and purpose of reality "consciousness" because the new
              sciences show principles like consciousness operate throughout
              reality. At the subatomic level I equate the dynamic, yang force
              with imagination and will, and the integrating, yin force with
              memory and creativity.  There is an inherent drive to evolve, for
              the propose of exploring full the potentials of consciousness, and,
              ultimately, to develop into fully self-conscious beings like
              ourselves.

                   There may well be an ever evolving "morphogenetic field"
              of human consciousness.   Individual consciousness survive and
              passes from body to body over many life times in a process
              known as "reincarnation".
                   The concept of consciousness must replace the concept of
              god. For if we know that consciousness is the basis of
              reality, and if we relate that to the fact that we all have
              consciousness, then it is obvious to all that we are the
              personification of natural, not "divine" principles of
              reality. The word god just confuses people, making them think
              that there is some divinity apart from and above from
              themselves.
                   Moreover, as experience has shown, the concept of god is
              so easily corrupted by authoritarianism as to be worse than
              useless -- ie. totally counter-productive.  How many people
              have been persecuted and murdered in the name of this, that or
              the other "god"??
                   People of good will must recognize this and give up the
              word god.  We are the product of our own conscious evolution
              for our own conscious purposes.    We created ourselves -- and
              we did not create ourselves to live in ignorance of that fact
              or to make ourselves suffer!!


                                                                                1074
              

              METAPSYCHOLOGY: (spiritual psychology)  We know that the human
              brain is really three brains: the original reptilian and
              mammalian brains controlling automatic and reflexive survival
              functions, and, heaped over these, the unique human "neo-
              cortex" which contains enormous intellectual and creative
              potentials.
                   Humans do not have to be content to be ruled by their
              "lower brains," by their most basic needs for survival,
              procreation and status.  Abraham Maslow points out there is a
              psychological need hierarchy.  If humans remain stuck on
              fulfilling the lower needs (safety, belonging, esteem) and
              ignore fulfillment of the higher needs (self-actualization,
              humanistic values, peak experiences) they become frustrated,
              obsessive, and addicted -- to food, drink, sex, power, money.
                   The need hierarchy and the concept of chakras describe
              essentially the same phenomena.  Humans rise up the need
              hierarchy or chakras in 3 ways: 1) by being aware that they in
              fact exist; 2) by creating a culture which suggests simple, as
              opposed to extravagant, definition of what fulfillment of
              these basic needs are and then creates institutions which make
              sure these basic need are fulfilled; 3) by having myths,
              symbols, and rituals which reinforce the existence and
              fulfillment of all human physical, emotional and spiritual
              needs.
                   Cultures worldwide have too little of the knowledge,
              attitudes and structures needed to boost us up our need
              hierarchies.  However, through education and meditation humans
              can develop their higher brain, move up the need hierarchy,
              rise to higher consciousness.  They can lose the desire for
              obsessive material accumulation, develop a tolerance for
              individual diversity, experience love and connectedness with
              all living things, give up the need to dominate, exploit or
              direct them, fulfill their individual potentials and even
              experience cosmic consciousness, cosmic ecstasy.


              ETHICS:  (What values we should pursue, how we should act
              towards one and other)  I believe in a yin-yang ethical
              system.  One in which hedonism/self-actualization are the yang
              goals, and utilitarian "what's best for all" the yin goals.
                   I believe our actions towards one and other must also be
              very "yin-yang".  The yang is the libertarian view that the
              individual is free to do as she/he pleases as long as she/he
              doe not harm others.  The yin is non-violence, cooperation and
              mutual aid.  They are both necessary and totally
              complementary.


                                                                                1075
              

              POLITICS:  We must begin to understand Gandhi's message that
              all conflicts - personal and political, individual and group,
              local, regional and global - should be resolved through non-
              violent mediation instead of police and military violence.
              Today's great nation states  have been created and maintained
              by violence.  Without violence they, would crumble, to be
              replaced by networks of non-violent communities.
                   Individuals must be free to establish or choose their own
              ethical system and then join in free, self-governing
              communities with those who share those views.  However, this
              "yang" commmunitarianism must be complemented by the "yin"
              values of non-violent conflict resolution between communities
              and mutual aid to all afflicted humans, whateve their
              community.
                   Our means to creating this society should be nonviolent
              as the ends we seek.  We should be assertive as possible,
              starting as soon as possible.


                                                                                1076
