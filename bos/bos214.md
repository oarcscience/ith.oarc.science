                         Some Thoughts on the Evolution of Wiccan Ritual  
                                           By: Paul Hume


              Undoubtedly (insofar as anything in this mish-mash of magick can be 
              undoubted (g)) the "convergent evolution" thing has a place in the 
              development of the various trads. 
                
              ie. hitting on similar manifestations of one True Thing.  An algorithm
              stays the same, no matter how you code it. 
                
              Some of the interesting divergences, f'rinstance... 
                
              The  Quarters:  Always  a lively discussion  (g).  Air's  in the East.
              No, it's in the North, etc.  The traditional post-GD attributions stem
              fgrom  a  system  attributed to  Egypt,  and  Egyptian  climate.   The
              traditional  Wiccan ones make sense in the context of Northern Europe,
              esp. Britain. (At least the Brit-Trad ones do). 
                
              The ceremonial (solar variety)  magician concentrates on the Equinoxes
              and  Solstices as  his major  milestones  in the  wheel  of the  year,
              whereas  Wicca sticks  with the  Cross-Quarters as their  main events.
              Again,  the solar  calendar is  an Egypto-Sumerian  bugaboo, and  more
              important  to agricultural peoples (or so it is suggested) whereas the
              Cross-Quarters fit the rhythm of birth and growth in herd animals, and
              thus suggest a tradition that  evolved in the herding cultures  of the
              early  Celts and  Britons (who did  not succumb  to the  siren song of
              agro-economy until much later). 
                
              How rigorous these arguments are is open to dispute - they may just be
              attempts to  correlate anthropology and  tradition.  But  they suggest
              areas of emphasis that separate the two paths, and suggest further the
              different aspects of Reality that drive them. 
                
              Paul 
               


                                                                                 947
