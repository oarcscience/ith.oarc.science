              Iyyar: A Menopause Ritual
              Penina Adelman

              A time to keep and a time to cast away

              This month's ritual has been designed with an awareness of our moth-
              ers, grandmother, and great-grandmothers who were earlier inhibited---
              even in the community of Jewish women--from marking the cessation of
              menstruation, of derech nashim (the way of younger women as in Genesis
              31:35) and the release from the physical tasks of childbearing and
              childrearing. Now wholly freed, our female ancestors would have been
              ready "to give birth" to their personal creativity, to dip into
              Miriam's Well without the distractions and responsibilities of family.

              We hope to convey a positive tenor to this life cycle event which has
              been feared and misunderstood by so many men and women in the past.
              Once a woman has reached the age beyond which pregnancy ceases, her
              gender identity is often blurred by society. She is in a transitional
              state, experienced by those interacting with her as being full of
              power and danger. During the tumulous fourteenth century when the
              Black Death struck in Europe,those women who managed to survive the
              disease and live to old age were thought to be witches.

              In interviewing post-menopausal woman to arrive at an appropriate
              ritual marking their "change of life", I found unanimous reactions.
              All indicated they would forgo any ritual ceremony that emphasized
              menopause, fearing a societal backlash which might discriminate
              against them as they advanced in age. Most said they did not feel very
              different physically after menopause. The aging process itself was
              their emphasis; the gradual body changes. These were linked not only
              to menopause, but to the entire process of aging. Whether these same
              feelings and attitudes will persist when contemporary young women
              reach their menopause is now being speculated.

              Some women may choose to mark the end of menopause with a "mature age
              bat mitzvah" if they have never had one as an adolescent. Setting a
              goal such as learning to read and speak Hebrew, to read Torah, to lead
              a prayer service, teaching a Jewish text within the forum of a bat
              mitzvah, at an age well beyond 12 or 13, is the way many older women
              are choosing to reenter the tradition after years of alienation from,
              or passive appreciation of, Jewish ritual. Others may wish to invite
              friends who experience menopause already or are presently undergoing
              it. My own mother has said that she could not imagine participating in
              a menopause ritual, but would have liked to get together with her
              friends to share experiences of those important years of change.

              Hithbagut
              Bring: The book of Ruth (several copies); a group for the mithbogeret.
              (As preparation, read the Book of Ruth.) Setting: Home of the mith-
              bogeret, the menopausal or post-menopausal woman, here named Tamar. We
              are in a sitting room. Have pictures of the woman as a baby, young
              girl, young woman, bride, mother, grandmother. Flowers and greens of
              the season decorate the room.  Attending are all the female relatives
              of the mithbogeret who can be present--sisters, daughters, mother,
              aunts--as well as her good friends, including members of the Rosh
              Hodesh group.


                                                                                2336

              Themes of Iyyar
              Keeper: Iyyar is a transitional month which falls between two major
              holidays--Pesach, in the month of Nisan, and Shavuot, in Sivan. From
              the second night of Pesach, we count forty-nine days (seven weeks)
              until Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks. This period is called the Omer.
              When the Temple still stood in Jerusalem, each family would count a
              sheaf offering of grain to bring to the Temple on the pilgrimage
              festival of Shavuot. The purpose of this may have been partly a way of
              blessing the Spring harvest which would also be celebrated on Shavuot.
                       In the act of counting, the Rabbis saw an opportunity to keep
              track of inner harvest of spiritual qualities. Every week of the Omer
              was to emphasize a particular attribute of God. Each day of the week
              then represented a different permutation of the divine attributes.
                       In the context of this Rosh Hodesh Iyyar marking Tamar's
              hithbagrut, one may think of the counting of years and deeds and
              events which make up a woman's life. given are seven distinct stages
              of life corresponding to the seven weeks of Omer: conception, pregnan-
              cy, birth, childhood, womanhood, motherhood, and maturity.
                       In the seven-week counting of the Omer, we find the sugges-
              tion of seven ritual activities which may be performed during the Rosh
              Hodesh celebration for any given month. We take as our impetus the
              Rabbis' notion of seven divine attributes to be explored and emulated
              for the purpose of healing the ills of the universe. We have desig-
              nated these activities:
              meditation, ritual immersion, (mikveh), singing, prayer, storytelling
              (midrash), text study (talmud torah). eating and drinking.

              Omer as Period of Mourning
              Keeper of Iyyar: The period of the Omer which includes the entire
              month of
              Iyyar is considered by observant Jews to be a time of mourning.
              Wedding
              ceremonies, hair cutting, and playing music are prohibited. The
              reasons for this are unclear, ranging from a plague said to have
              killed the disciples of Rabbi Akiba in the early centuries of the
              Common Era, to the influence of a Roman superstition which held that
              during this time of year, the souls of the dead wander into the land
              of the living. We do not view menopause as a time to mourn the "end of
              fertility", as have many in the past. Our purpose in coming together
              today is, rather, to understand and recognize the meaning of menopause
              for women who have experienced it or will soon enter its phases. Today
              we have an opportunity to think of new ways for women to mark this
              time in future years.

              Sign of Iyyar
                   Keeper of Iyyar: The astrological sign of the month is the Bull,
              Shor. Nisan is the month during which seeds are planted. The bull
              ploughs the earth, bending its broad neck to the ground, dragging a
              heavy load. The bull tends the change from the new Spring growth of
              Nisan to the first Spring harvest of Sivan. The rhythms of the earth
              reverberate throughtout the strong body of the bull.

              Kavannah
                   Keeper of Iyyar: In some cultures, once a woman has passed the
              age of childbearing, she is known as the "Wise Woman" of the com-
              munity. In her reside the knowledge and values of her people which she
              transmits to the young. Hers is the status of a venerated elder. This
              contrasts sharply with the devalued status of the aging female in our
              own culture. Today we intend to question this and to learn about the
              experience all have had during menopause in order to instill new and


                                                                                2337

              positive expectations in our children and grandchildren. One of the
              major misconceptions we need to address has to do with sex and the
              older woman. In Judaism, sex has never been linked only to procrea-
              tion. On the contrary, in addition to procreation, sex exists for the
              sake of pleasure, wellbeing, and harmony in a marriage. Therefore,
              when a woman has passed the age of childbearing and even earlier, she
              is encouraged by Jewish law to enjoy sex with her partner. Are there
              any other kavannot? Each woman voices her own intention for the
              ritual.

              Woman: To mark the passing of physical fertility and to rededicate
              ourselves to a greater focus on spiritual, intellectual, and artistic
              creativity and fertility.

              Woman: To say good-bye to the womb, rechem, the center of childbear-
              ing.

              Woman: To praise and give thanks for the cycles of life which pulsate
              through our bodies.

              Woman: To say good-bye and good riddance to tampoons and sanitary
              napkins and pads and foams and jellies and diaphragms and pills and
              anything else I've left out--forever!

              Tamar, the Mithbogeret: I would like this to be a ritual of transmit-
              ting wisdom, hokhmah.

              In Greek, the word for "wisdom", sophia, was identified with a female
              figure.  In Hebrew hokhmah is a word of the feminine gender. The
              connection between wisdom of Tekoa and Abel in 11 Samuel 14 and 11
              Samuel 20, respectively, are examples of what seemed to be a conven-
              tion in Isreal at that time--a woman of the community who knew how to
              choose her words wisely and communicate the desired message. She was
              perhaps a female counterpart to the Hebrew prophet, God's instrument
              of communication with the people of Isreal. More examples are found in
              Proverbs 14:1 and in poem recited to the woman of the household on
              Sabbath evening, "A Woman of Valor." One of the last lines speaks of
              her mouth, which "opens with wisdom."

                   In fairy tales, the woman with special powers, with the knowledge
              of creation and destruction, is either an evil witch or a good fairy
              godmother.  Both are frequently characterized as older women. In this
              hithbagrut ritual, we teach and lead a discussion based on two stories
              of mother and daughter figures where the mother passes on her life's
              wisdom to her daughter. they are stories of Naomi and Ruth in the
              Bible and Demeter and Persephone from Greek mythology.

              Storytelling
                 All should have a copy of he story of Ruth and Naomi, or should
              have read the story in preparation. Tamar, the mithbogeret, then tells
              the Greek myth in her own words.

                                      Demeter and Persephone

              Once there lived a goddess who ruled over the earth. She had power
              over agriculture, causing aboundant growth of cereals and grains. In
              this way she echoed Naomi and Ruth, women of the land. Demeter had one
              lovely daughter, Persephone, as fair as the first flower of Spring.

              One day Persephone wandered far from her mother to pick flowers which


                                                                                2338

              beckoned. Steeped in the fragrance of those blooms, she was startled
              by Hades, the dark god of the Underworld. He seized her and pulled her
              down to his cold, damp kingdom beneath the earth.

              Demeter sank into despair when her beloved daughter did not return.
              She entered into mourning, forgetting to bring new buds into being.
              She grieved for her daughter, even refusing to eat or sleep. Thus, the
              earth was allowed to wither.

              When at last she sought aid from the gods to find her daughter, she
              was told that if Persephone had not eaten food in the Underworld, she
              could return unharmed to this world. Though Persephone had not been
              tempted by food, Hades was able to break her resolve with a single
              ruby seed of a pomegranite. Knowing that if he could induce her to
              nourish herself in his domain, he could have her as his wife, he
              strove to make her taste food. Because of that one seed, she would now
              have to divide her time equally between Hades and Demeter, between the
              land of darkness and death and the land of light and life.

              That is why the Greeks say that the earth blooms half  the year and
              withers during the other half. When Persephone descends to her hus-
              band,
              Hades, Demeter forgets to bring the buds into being.

              Tamar describes the link between these stories in which an older woamn
              passes down special knowledge to a younger woman, and the onset of
              menopause in which the transmission of wisdom amoung the members of a
              women's community is crucial. She tells  of her own experience of
              menopause and asks other women to share theirs. The younger women who
              are present share their fears and fantasies of menopause and ask
              questions of the older women.

              Meditation and Movement
                  Woman: Since menopause involves a new relationship with one's
              body, we now meditate on ending that segment of our live characterized
              by an active womb.

                  This meditation begins with a movement excercise called "Aura-
              Brushing." The "aura" is the psychic field arond an individual. This
              aura may be affected by fatigue, illness, depression, isolation. The
              purpose of "brushing the aura" is to symbolize making a fresh start by
              discarding the cobwebs which drain one of energy.

              We start by forming groups of threes, one woman standing in the
              middle, one on each side of her. Now the woman in the middle should
              close her eyes. the other two will begin to whisk the air upward from
              her feet as they whisper her name repeatedly. They whisk from her
              feet, her legs, her trunk, up to her neck and head, whispering all the
              while.

              Each woman in the group takes turns standing in the middle while the
              other two brush her "aura".

              Woman: I composed this meditation especially with you in mind. Tamar,
              as you and I have been working together, I know the kind of imagery
              you might use for yourself.

              It is important to note here that the process just mentioned is a
              crucial one for the Rosh Hodesh ritual. As pioneers in new ritual, we
              continu to scrutinize our conceptions to create meaningful ceremonies.


                                                                                2339

              In this case, Tamar asked for help in saying good-bye to her once-act-
              ive womb. another woman might require a different image journey.

              Woman: While we composed the following for Tamar, all may participate,
              even those not yet at menopause. But do not feel you must participate.
              You may wish to close your eyes sending healing energy to Tamar. Or,
              you may wish to start with this visualization and then let your own
              imagination take over. Some of you may want to leave the room. How you
              decide to participate is your own choice.

              Now, begin by finding a comfortable position. Close your eyes and
              focus on your breathing deeply in and out...

              See yourself carrying your womb in a crystal jar. Look at it care-
              fully. take the jar with you to Jerusalem. Carry it carefully up to
              the Mount of Olives.  Find a spot on the Mount of Olives and begin
              digging a hole with your hands.

              Dig deeply, and when the hole is deep enough, place the jar containing
              your womb deep into the Jerusalem earth. Cover the jar carefully. Know
              that your womb is buried safely, forever. Before leaving the spot
              where your womb is buried, thank your womb for all that it has given
              you. Thank the earth for protecting and housing your womb.

              Cover the spot with a smooth, white Jerusalem stone. Walk to a nearby
              waterfall. Stand beneath it and feel yourself cleased from within and
              without.  Retuen home knowing that you will continue to be creative
              and productive. Feel yourself strong and in perfect health.

              When you are ready open your eyes.

              When the mediatation is over, some of the women share what they felt.
              Others remain silent, choosing to listen. Tamar is very peaceful,
              talking about what this ritual evening has meant to her.

              Gift the women present Tamar, the mithbogeret, with a gift, one they
              have made or bought. The Keeper of Iyyar invites all to partake of the
              food and drink on the table.


                                                                                2340
