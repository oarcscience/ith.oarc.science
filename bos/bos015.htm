<CENTER><H1>Invocations to Frigg, Baldur, Freyja, Freyr, Brigit, Herne and Thorr</H1>
<H4>Russ Anderson</H4></CENTER>
<P><I>When the invocation to Frigg was first used, each person in a healing circle invoked a healer into hirself. This was my invocation. The rest of the circle was asked to echo &quot;Join us, Frigg&quot; as I was saying &quot;Join us, Frigg&quot;. This was my first attempt at writing an invocation, and it DID work. I hope that it also works for anyone else who wishes to use it, because it now feels like time to share it.<BR>Blessed Be, Russ.</I></P>
