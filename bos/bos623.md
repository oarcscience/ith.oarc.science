    Introduction

    Less than a thousand years ago the elders of Iceland made a fateful
    decision.  Under political pressure from Christian Europe and faced
    with the need for trade, the Allthing or national assembly declared
    Iceland to be an officially Christian country.  Within a few centuries
    the last remnants of Nordic Paganism, which once stretched through all
    of Northern Europe were thought dead.  However, Iceland was a tolerant
    country and the myths, stories, and legends of Pagan times were left
    unburnt to kindle the fires of belief in later generations.  In 1972
    Iceland once again recognized Nordic Paganism as a legitimate and
    legal religion.

    Iceland and Sweden were the last two bastions of the Pagan religion
    originally practiced by the people of the various Germanic tribes.
    Today Nordic Paganism also known as Odinism, Heathenism, Northern
    Tradition, or Asatru (an Old-Norse term meaning .loyalty to the Gods.)
    is practiced in virtually all the countries where it originally
    flourished as well as America and Australia.  It is one of a body of
    religions calling themselves Neo-Paganism which include Druidism, the
    revival of ancient Celtic Paganism, and Wicca or Witchcraft.  However
    Asatru remains largely unknown even within the community of Neo-Pagan
    believers.

    This book is intended as a basic manual to the beliefs and practices
    of the Raven Kindred of Asatru.  We do not pretend to be experts and
    won.t act as if we were.  Rather we are simply believers in the Old
    Gods seeking to share our practice and research with others who are
    true to the Aesir.  Our aim is to present a simple guide which will
    allow easy understanding of the principles behind Asatru and to give
    hints for further study and exploration.

    While we attempt to be historically accurate to our religion's roots,
    it.s important to note that there are many things that we simply don.t
    know or which aren.t written in stone.  While we occasionally need to
    flesh out our systems where we don.t have direct evidence of our
    ancestors ways, we are not likely to simply make up things.  It is
    very important to us to stay as true to the ways of the old Pagans as
    is possible.  In those places where the various myths, legends, and
    folklore are not clear we have tried to indicate this.  We do not
    present our way as the .true. Asatru, but we do feel that all Asatru
    should be solidly connected to its roots in ancient Norse practice.
    Where we do not know the certain answer to a quesation, there is room
    for exploration, but not for simply making something up out of whole
    cloth.  While inspiration from the Gods is an important part of our
    movement, this is not make believe and any additions to the historical
    2833

    system should be made with respect to our ancient roots.

    The most important thing for modern people to remember about Asatru is
    that it is a religion.  It is not a system of magick or spirituality
    or .New Age Practice. which can be grafted onto something else or onto
    which other .systems. can be grafted wholesale.  Asatru is a word
    derived from .As. a God of the Aesir family and .tru. meaning troth.
    To be Asatru is to be bound by loyalty and troth to the Old Gods of
    the North.  While we may believe in the deities of other religions and
    peoples, and even respect them, these are not our Gods.  While we may
    take part in rituals dedicated to other Gods at ecumenical Pagan
    festivals or gatherings which encompass many other religions, we must
    not forget that Asatru is our religion and our primary concern.  One
    simply does not collect membership in Asatru (or any other religion)
    as if one were collecting stamps.  Our Gods are real and worthy of our
    respect.

    Today many people .practice. a number of different religions feeling
    that this is the best way to avoid intolerance, we have a completely
    different view of the world.  Asatru is not a universal religion.  We
    do not see ourselves as a path for everyone.  We are true polytheists
    and see the world as encompassing many religions which worship many
    Gods.  While we do not deny the beliefs of others, we also do not
    confuse them with our own.  The idea that .it is all one. is anathema
    to the true Heathen.  To claim that Odin is the same God as Zeus is
    madness.  Would one claim that green and red are the same merely
    because they are both colors? If one disagrees with this perspective
    or finds it limiting so be it.  Our belief is also that Asatru is not
    a path for everyone and it is better to find ones own way rather than
    bend the religions of others to fit ourselves.

    In accordance with this non-universalist conception, as much as we
    have been able to, we have not adopted the practices of other Pagan
    religions or magickal systems.  Those familiar with Wicca will note
    that most modern Neo-Pagan systems are derived from it.  This is not
    the case with Asatru.  Our religion began with reconstruction based on
    written sources dating from the Pagan period.  This has been followed
    by 20 years of innovation and practice within the Heathen community.
    While we make no pretensions that this has resulted in a system that
    is identical with that of our spiritual ancestors, it is at least a
    system that is our own.

    In saying this I would reiterate that we do not put down any religion
    for it.s beliefs.  We merely ask for the integrity of our own.  We are
    not rejecting other systems because they are wrong or because we think
    ill of them, we are rather choosing Asatru because of our love and
    devotion to it.

    The Rituals of Asatru

    The Blot

    The Blot is the most common ritual within Asatru.  In its simplest
    form a blot is making a sacrifice to the Gods.  In the old days this
    was done by feasting on an animal consecrated to the Gods and then
    slaughtered.  As we are no longer farmers and our needs are simpler
    today, the most common blot is an offering of mead or other alcoholic
    beverage to the deities.
    2834

    Many modern folk will be suspicious of a ritual such as this.  Rituals
    which are deemed sacrifices, such as the blot, have been falsely
    interpreted by post-Pagan sources in order to denigrate the ritual or
    trivialize them.  The most common myth about ritual sacrifice is that
    one is buying off a deity e.g.  one throws a virgin into the Volcano
    so it won.t erupt.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In
    Asatru it is believed that we are not only the worshippers of the Gods
    but that we are physically related to them.  The Eddas tell of a God,
    Rig, who went to various farmsteads and fathered the human race so we
    are physically kin to the Gods.  On a more esoteric level, humankind
    is gifted with .ond. or the gift of ecstasy.  Ond is a force that is
    of the Gods.  It is everything that makes humans different from the
    other creatures of the world.  As creatures with this gift, we are
    immediately connected to the Gods, we are part of their tribe, their
    kin.  Thus we are not simply buying off the Gods by offering them
    something that they want, but we are sharing with the Gods something
    that we all take joy in.  Sharing and gift giving was an important
    part of most ancient cultures and had magical significance.  Giving a
    gift was a sign of friendship, kinship, and connection.  By sharing a
    blot with the Gods we reaffirm our connection to them and thus
    reawaken their powers within us and their watchfulness over our world.

    A blot can be a simple affair where a horn of mead is consecrated to
    the Gods and then poured as a libation, or it can be a part of a
    larger ritual.  A good comparison is the Catholic Mass which may be
    part of a regular service or special event such as a wedding or
    funeral, or it may be done as a purely magical-religious practice
    without any sermon, hymns, or other trappings.

    The blot consists of three parts, the hallowing or consecrating of the
    offering, the sharing of the offering, and the libation.  Each of
    these is equally important.  The only tools required are mead, beer or
    juice, a horn or chalice, a sprig of evergreen used to sprinkle the
    mead, and a ceremonial bowl known as a Hlautbowl into which the
    initial libation will be made.

    The blot begins with the consecration of the offering.  The Gothi
    (Priest) or Gythia (Priestess) officiating at the blot invokes the God
    or Goddess being honored.  This is usually accomplished by a spoken
    declaration with ones arms being held above ones head in a Y shape, in
    imitation of the rune elhaz.  This posture is used for most
    invocations and prayers throughout Asatru.  After the spoken
    invocation an appropriate rune or other symbol of the God or Goddess
    may be drawn in the air with the finger or with the staff.  Once the
    God is invoked, the Gothi takes up the horn.  His assistant pours mead
    from the bottle into the horn.  The Gothi then traces the hammer sign
    (an upside down T) over the horn as a blessing and holds it above his
    head offering it to the Gods.  He then speaks a request that the God
    or Goddess bless the offering and accept it as a sacrifice.  At the
    least one will feel the presence of the deity; at best one will be
    able to feel in some inner way the God taking of the mead and drinking
    it.

    The mead is now not only blessed with divine power but has passed the
    lips of the God or Goddess.  The Gothi then takes a drink of the horn
    and it is passed around the gathered folk.  Although it sounds like a
    very simple thing, it can be a very powerful experience.  At this
    point the mead is no longer simply a drink but is imbued with the
    2835

    blessing and power of the God or Goddess being honored.  When one
    drinks, one is taking that power into oneself.  This is the essence of
    the rune Gebo.  After the horn has made the rounds once, the Gothi
    again drinks from the horn and then empties the remainder into the
    hlautbowl.  The Gothi then takes up the evergreen sprig and his
    assistant the Hlautbowl and the Gothi sprinkles the mead around the
    circle or temple or onto the altar.  If there are a great number of
    the folk gathered, one may wish to drop the drinking and merely
    sprinkle the various folk with the mead as a way of sharing it.  In a
    small group one might merely drink as the blessing.

    When this is done the Hlautbowl is taken by the Gothi and poured out
    onto the ground.  This is done as an offering not only to the God
    invoked at the blot, but it is also traditional to remember the Earth
    Mother at this time, since it is being poured onto her ground.  Many
    invocations mention the God, Goddess, or spirit being sacrificed to,
    and then Mother Earth, as in the Sigrdrifa Prayer .Hail to the Gods
    and to the Goddesses as well; Hail Earth that gives to all men..
    (Sigrdrifumal 3) With this action, the blot is ended.

    Obviously this is a very sparse ritual and if performed alone could be
    completed in only a few minutes.  This is as it should be, for blots
    are often poured not because it is a time of gathering or festivity
    for the folk, but because the blot must be poured in honor or petition
    of a God or Goddess on their holiday or some other important occasion.
    For example, a father tending his sick child might pour a blot to Eir
    the Goddess of healing.  Obviously he doesn.t have time to waste on
    the .trappings. of ritual.  The intent is to make an offering to the
    Goddess as quickly as possible.  At some times a full celebration
    might not be made of a holiday because of a persons hectic schedule,
    but at the least a blot should be made to mark the occasion.  However,
    in most cases a blot will at least be accompanied by a statement of
    intent at the beginning and some sort of conclusion at the end.  It
    might also be interspersed with or done at the conclusion of ritual
    theater or magic.

    The Sumbel

    One of the most common celebrations noted in tales of our ancestors is
    the Sumbel or ritual drinking celebration.  This was a more mundane
    and social sort of ritual than the blot, but of no less importance.
    When Beowulf came to Hrothgar, the first thing they did was to drink
    at a ritual sumbel.  This was a way of establishing Beowulf.s identity
    and what his intent was, and doing so in a sacred and traditional
    manner.  At the sumbel toasts are drunk to the Gods, as well as to a
    persons ancestors or personal heroes.  Rather than a toast, a person
    might also offer a brag or some story, song, or poem that has
    significance.  The importance is that at the end of the toast, story,
    or whatever, the person offering it drinks from the horn, and in doing
    so .drinks in. what he spoke.

    The sumbel is also an important time for the folk to get to know each
    other in a more intimate way than most people are willing to share.
    Modern society is at two extremes.  At one end are the emotionless
    beings who have been robbed of their soul by modern industrial secular
    culture.  On the other side are those pathetic .sensitive New-Age
    guys. who spend their lives consciously attempting to stir their
    emotions and who force an unnatural level of intimacy between
    2836

    themselves and others.  There are some levels of emotional intimacy
    which are not meant to be openly shared with strangers.  Doing so
    reduces their meaning to the mundane.  At sumbel, barriers can be
    lowered in a place which is sacred to the Gods and the Folk.  Thoughts
    can be shared among companions and friends without embarrassment or
    forced intimacy.

    One format for the sumbel with a history in tradition is to drink
    three rounds.  The first is dedicated to the Gods, the second to great
    heroes of the folk such as historical figures or heroes from the
    sagas, and the third to personal ancestors, heroes, or friends which
    have passed from this world.

    Another theme for a sumbel is past, present, and future.  This type of
    sumbel is more of a magical ritual than one of celebration.  The idea
    is to make toasts which bring up some aspect of your past, and present
    situation, and a third toast or brag which represents your wishes for
    the future.  One might make a toast to the first Asatru ritual one
    attended as the past, a second to the companions and kindred then
    gathered, and for his third toast might state that he intends to be
    initiated as a Gothi in the coming year.  The purpose would be to link
    the coming event of his initiation with the two already accomplished
    events of pledging Asatru and finding a kindred . two other important
    rites of passage.  In this case initiation as a Gothi then becomes
    something which is linked to a chain of events that have already
    occurred, rather than an isolated action which might occur.  Thus
    magically, this moves the person towards his initiation.

    A third and everpopular type of sumbel is a free-for-all where stories
    are told, toasts are made, and bragging is done until all the gathered
    Odinists are under the table.  Perhaps this is not quite so esoteric
    or purposeful as the previous ideas, but it.s certainly in keeping
    with the examples of our Gods and ancestors! Joy is better than guilt!

    These are only ideas.  The sumbel is a very open ended type of thing
    and the framework is very simple to adapt.

    One thing important to note about any Asatru ritual is that ours is a
    holistic religion.  We do not limit our Gods or spirituality to a
    certain time and place.  While the sacrament of the blot is usually
    poured as part of a ceremony, the feast afterwards, singing of sacred
    songs, reciting of poetry, Morris Dancing, etc are all part of our
    religion.  A truly traditional celebration might begin with a rather
    informal greeting of the dawn, involve May Dancing and .mystery
    plays,. then move on to a more structured Blot, and finally to a feast
    capped by a sumbel.  On the other side of things, there.s no reason
    why at a family feast one might not simply pour a bottle of beer or
    mead as an offering without the other trappings of a blot.

    Profession

    Profession is one of the most important ceremonies in Asatru.  To
    Profess one.s belief in and kinship to the Gods should be an important
    turning point in ones life and the beginning of a new understanding of
    the self.  Profession is, however, a very simple and rather short
    ceremony.  In our kindred we usually profess people after beginning
    the ritual, but before we offer the formal blot.

    2837

    Profession is not an occult or initiatory ceremony.  It is nothing
    less than it.s name: one professes (declares, affirms) his wish to
    become one of the Asafolk.  This oath is usually taken by the
    Kindred-Gothi on the oath ring or some other Holy object as follows:

    The Gothi stands in front of the altar and says .Will [insert name
    here] please come forward.. After he or she does so .Are you here of
    your own free will? Is it your intention to solemnly swear allegiance
    and kinship to the Gods of Asgard, the Aesir and Vanir?. If the answer
    to both these questions is in the affirmative the Gothi takes up the
    oath ring and holds it out to the person professing and says .Repeat
    after me.  I swear to ever uphold the Raven Banner of Asgard, to
    follow the way of the North, to always act with honor and bravery, and
    to be ever true to the Aesir and Vanir and to Asatru.  By the Gods I
    so swear.  By my honor I so swear.  On this Holy Ring I do swear.
    Hail the Gods.. The kindred then replies .Hail the Gods!. and the
    Gothi finishes .Then be welcome to the service of Asgard and the Folk
    of the Asatru..

    There may be other celebrations connected to a Profession, just as
    other religions hold Bar Mitzvah or Confirmation parties.  When
    someone joins our kindred, we hold a Sumbel of nine rounds, each
    dedicated to one of the values of Asatru (see below) and toast those
    values to the new kinsman.


    The Holidays

    The ancient Norse knew four major holidays the Spring and Autumn
    Equinoxes which we call Summer and Winter Finding, and the two
    solstices which we call Midsummer and Yule.  However, there were many
    other minor festivals and modern Asatru have added even more.  A
    calendar of our kindred.s rituals is provided in an appendix and I
    also encourage anyone to find as many as one is willing to meet for.
    We meet monthly, but some groups meet 8 times a year and also
    celebrate the cross-quarter days of May Day/Walpurgis,
    Halloween/Samhain, February eve or The Charming of the Plow, and
    Lammastide or Freyfaxi,

    Most of our rituals also honor only one or a few Gods or Goddesses at
    any one time.  However, there is no reason why the entire pantheon
    should not be offered prayers and thanks at any occasion.  This would
    be particularly appropriate at the major holidays.  Unlike most other
    groups in the Neo-Pagan movement, we do not necessarily honor Gods in
    male/female pairs.  The boy/girl notion is one taken from the Pagan
    fertility religion of Wicca and isn.t necessarily appropriate to our
    Gods, who often represent things other than fertility.  So while a
    Spring ritual held in honor of Freya and Frey as fertility deities
    might wish to honor them together, there is no reason to include Frigg
    in a ritual dedicated to Odin as the God of War.

    Yule

    Yule is the most important holiday of the year.  Everyone is familiar
    with the shortness of the deep winter days, but in the Scandinavian
    countries this is of even greater importance.  At the Yuletide there
    is almost no sunlight at all, and the climate would have people bound
    in their homes waiting for the return of Spring.
    2838

    Yule is a long festival, traditionally held to be 12 days or more.
    After Yule the days began to get longer and the festival represented
    the breaking of the heart of winter and the beginning of the new year.
    Yule was the holiday of either Thor or Frey, although there is no
    reason not to honor both Gods in modern practice.  Frey is the God of
    fertility and farming and was honored at Yule in the hopes that his
    time would soon return.  Thor was the sworn enemy of the Frost Giants
    and Jotunn who ruled the winter months, and as such was honored as the
    God who.s actions fought off these creatures and brought back the
    spring.  Sunna, the Goddess of the Sun, should also be honored at
    Yule, although she is held at more important during the summer months
    when she is at her strongest.

    The most important symbols of Yule are still with us today.  Most of
    the supposedly secular customs of Christmas are actually Pagan in
    origin.  Evergreen trees and holly which remained green throughout the
    long nights and cold were a promise that spring would once again
    return to the land.  These symbols may also have been a connection to
    the nature spirits who have sway over the return of the warm days.
    The modern conception of Santa Claus as an elf, for whom offerings of
    milk and cookies are left, is probably a modern continuation of
    leaving offerings for the Alvar and other nature spirits.  The idea of
    children staying up all night in the hopes of catching a glimpse of
    Santa Claus may be a remnant of people staying awake to mark the long
    night and remind the sun to return.  (In the latter case it.s
    considered an adequate substitution to leave a candle going all night
    to light the way for the returning sun.)

    Yule is a weeks long festival, not just a single holiday.  The Yule
    season begins on the solstice, which is the Mother Night of Yule, and
    ends with Twelfth Night on January sixth.  As a point of interest,
    January seventh is St.  Distaff.s day, which Nigel Pennic has
    suggested may have been a day sacred to Frigg, whose symbol is the
    distaff.

    While one might expect a rather dour theme to a holiday held in the
    darkness and cold, Yule is a time of feasting and gladness.

    In various places different Gods were held to be the most important at
    Yule.  Thor was honored because it is he who fights and kills the
    Jotunn, who surely are the ones responsible for the loss of warmth in
    the world.  Yule was when Thor broke the back of winter and allowed
    the warmth to slowly return to the world.  Frey was also honored
    because it was he who married Gerd and warmed her heart, returning
    fertility to the world.

    There are simply so many different Yule customs, both ancient and
    modern, that one has almost limitless possibilities even when staying
    within Scandanavian and Germanic customs.  In modern practice one
    might honor Sunna on the Mother Night, then hold a blot a few days
    later to Thor, a feast for New Years day which is shared with the
    house and land spirits, and then finish on Twelfth Night with a ritual
    to Frey, whose time is then officially beginning.

    Summer Finding

    Summer Finding is also known to many groups as Ostara, the holiday
    sacred to the Goddess for whom the modern Easter is named.  She is a
    2839

    fertility Goddess and her symbols are the hare and the egg.  She was
    an important Goddess of spring to the ancient Saxons, but we know
    little else of her other than this.  Some have suggested that Ostara
    is merely an alternate name for Frigg or Freya, but neither of these
    Goddesses seem to have quite the same fertility function as Ostara
    does.  Frigg seems too high class to be associated with such an earthy
    festival and Freya.s form of fertility is more based on eroticism than
    reproduction.

    The obvious folk tradition at this time of year involves eggs.  These
    were colored as they are today, but then they were buried, or more
    appropriately, planted in the earth.  Some have suggested that the act
    was purely magical, the fertility of the eggs would then be
    transferred from the animal realm to the plant realm and would
    increase the prosperity of the harvest.  It.s also possible that they
    were left as an offering to the alvar and the spirits of the plants.

    In any case a blot should be prepared to the Goddess of Spring,
    however one wishes to honor her, and also to the spirits of the land.

    Midsummer Day

    The summer solstice was second only to Yule in importance to the
    ancient Northmen.  Some groups mark this day as sacred to Balder, but
    we disagree with this.  While Balder can be seen as a dying and
    resurrected Sun God, in the mythology we are most familiar with, he
    does not return to life until Ragnarok and it seems like .bad karma.
    to symbolically kill the sun when you know he doesn.t come back until
    the end of the world.  Instead, we mark this day as sacred to the
    Goddess Sunna, who is literally the sun.

    One idea for midsummer is to remain awake all night and mark the
    shortest night of the year, then at sunrise to perform a .Greeting of
    Sunna. and a blot to her.

    Another midsummer custom is the rolling of a flaming wagon wheel down
    a hill to mark the turning of the wheel of the year.  If fire would
    otherwise be a hazard, one could parade a wheel covered with candles
    for similar effect.  It is also a time for general merriment and in
    the Scandinavian countries many of what we know as the traditional May
    Day rituals such as May Poles and Morris Dances were instead
    celebrated at Midsummer.

    Winter Finding

    I have not come across a great deal of traditional lore about the
    Autumn Equinox which we know as Winter Finding.  It seems to have been
    overshadowed to some extent by the Winter Nights which we celebrate at
    the equinox rather than at the more traditional time of mid-November.

    If one wishes not to do this, the Winter Finding would be a festival
    of harvest.  One should hold a Blot to whichever Gods of fertility
    seem most appropriate and then hold a large feast, concerntrating on
    vegetables that are currently in season.

    Winter Nights

    The Winter Nights are the traditional festival honoring the Disir or
    2840

    family spirits.  It is a time to remember your family, the dead, and
    your ancestors.  (For more information on the Disir see the chapter
    .Elves and other Spirits..)

    A Freyablot may be performed at this time as Freya is known as the
    Vanadis (i.e.  the Dis of the Vanir) or the Great Dis, and she seems
    to be the Goddess of the Disir themselves.  This is probably connected
    to Freya.s position as recipient of half the battle-slain.  One might
    also simply want to honor the Disir as a whole, or attempt to summon
    and pour offering to your own family.s Dis.  A sumbel which toasts
    ones ancestors and passed on friends would also be in order.  If a
    feast is held, it should be quiet and respectful of the character of
    the season.  Another idea is a silent .mum feast,. a custom which is
    found the world over.

    The various Halloween customs such as dressing in costume or
    celebrating this time as a time where the worlds of the living and the
    dead connect are more Celtic in origin than Nordic and probably should
    not be part of an Asatru celebration.


    The Gods of Asgard

    The Old Norse reckoned that there were three races of Gods: the Aesir,
    the Vanir, and the Jotunn.  The Aesir are those beings most often
    referred to in the ancient literature simply as .the Gods.. They are
    the Gods of society, representing things such as Kingship, Craft, etc.
    The Vanir are more closely connected to the earth and represent the
    fecundity of the land and the natural forces which help mankind.  Once
    there was a great war between the Aesir and the Vanir, but this was
    eventually settled and Frey, Freya, and Njord came to live with the
    Aesir to seal the peace.  The Jotunn are a third race of Gods and at
    constant war with the Aesir, but there is and never will be peace in
    this battle.  The Jotunn are never called Gods, but rather referred to
    as giants.  They represent the natural forces of chaos and destruction
    as the Aesir represent forces of order and society.  Just as fire and
    ice mix to form the world, this creative interaction of chaos and
    order maintains the balance of the world.  In the end the two sides
    will meet in the great battle of Ragnarok and the world will be
    destroyed, only to be reborn.

    The Norse Gods were not held to be all powerful or immortal.  Their
    youth was maintained very precariously by the magickal apples of the
    Goddess Idunna.  More importantly at the end of the world a good
    number of the Gods will die in battle.  The Northern view of the world
    was a practical one with little assurance for the future and little
    perfection and the Gods are no exception.

    The Gods in the Temple: Odin, Thor, and Frey

    The three most important Gods were held to be Odin, Thor, and Frey.
    These were the deities whose statutes stood at the altar of the temple
    at Upsalla.  They are considered the most important because of what
    they represent.  Mythologer Georges Dumezil has linked these three
    deities with the three classes of Indo-European culture: the Kings,
    the Warriors, and the Farmers.  Although the fit is not an exact one,
    it is probably true that these three deities most concretely
    symbolized the various aspects of life and culture and most people
    2841

    would have found a God who represented their life-experience in one of
    these three deities.

    Odin is the Allfather, remembered today best as a God of war and of
    the berserk rage of the Vikings.  However, he has other aspects which
    are just as strong or stronger.  In the Eddas, he is the King of the
    Gods, but this is a position which most of the Germanic peoples
    attributed to Tyr.  It.s likely that Odin only became King during the
    Viking Age.  Being the Allfather, his original position of leadership
    was probably familial rather than legislative.  Most importantly he is
    a God of transcendent wisdom and in relation to that a God of magick.
    He is the God of the Runes, the magical alphabet which holds the
    mysteries of the universe within it.  In most of the non-Viking
    countries, Odin.s warrior aspect was played down.  In England, where
    he is known as Woden, he is a gray cloaked wanderer (the inspiration
    for Tolkien.s Gandalf) who travels the country, usually alone,
    surveying his land.  Here again we see him in the position of a father
    figure, a warder of the land but not necessarily a King.  Odin is also
    a God of the dead.  Half of the slain in battles go to him to prepare
    for the Ragnarok.  (The remaining half go to Freya.) He also has
    associations with the dead as a practitioner of Seidhr, a form of
    shamanic magick which he learned from Freya and used on various
    occasions to travel to Hel and seek the knowledge of those who have
    passed from this world.  It.s difficult to classify Odin simply
    because he was such a popular God during the last stages of Norse
    Paganism and thus absorbed many traits of other Gods.

    Thor is probably the best known of the Norse Gods.  He is a simple
    God, the patron of farmers and other folk who are .wise, but not too
    wise. as the Eddas advise us to be.  Thor is best known for wandering
    the world in search of adventure; usually found in the form of giants
    or other monsters to kill.  He possesses tremendous strength and the
    hammer Mjolnir, which was made for him by the Dwarfs.  Mjolnir is
    considered to be the Gods greatest treasure because it is sure
    protection from the forces of chaos.  Using Mjolnir, Thor is a warrior
    figure, but he is less a professional warrior than a common man called
    upon to defend his land.  He loves battle not for itself as do the
    berserkers of Odin, nor does he have a strong code of honor such as
    that of Tyr.in fact he chronically breaks with honor and kills giants
    whether they have the protection of .hospitality. or not.  Thor is
    associated with thunder, and is also the God of rain and storms, but
    it.s important to note that he is not the God of destructive storms.
    Thor is nature as a benefit to man.  The Jotunn are held to be the
    source of the destruction found in nature.  Thor was the God of
    .everyman.. He was simple in purpose, strong, and free.  He was most
    beloved of the freemen farmers who populated the Germanic lands.

    Frey is a God of peace and fertility.  If Thor is the God of the
    farmer, then Frey is the God of the crops themselves.  His symbol is
    the priapus and his blessings were sought at planting and other
    important agricultural festivals.  The word .frey. means .Lord. and
    it.s unsure if this is the Gods name or his title.  He is also known
    as Ing.  We do not known a great deal more about Frey as few myths
    have survived which give us any insight into his character.  As much
    as he is a God of fertility, he is also a God of peace and Ing was
    said to have brought a Golden Age of peace and prosperity to old
    Denmark.  Horses are held to be sacred to Frey, probably because of
    fertility connections.
    2842

    Goddesses

    In general we know much less about how our ancestors worshipped the
    Goddesses than the Gods.  Later Norse culture was very bound up with
    the vikings and it is likely that the Goddesses were deemphasized at
    this point.  More importantly, virtually all the mythology we have
    today was recorded during the Christian period and Christian culture
    had little respect for women, least of all independent and strong
    women like those of Nordic society.

    Freya is the most important of the Goddesses or at least that Goddess
    about which we known the most.  She was the sister of Frey and along
    with him was sent to live with the Aesir in order to seal a peace
    agreement.  Freya is a Goddess with two distinct sides to her.  First,
    she is the Goddess of love and beauty and second a Goddess of war who
    shares the battle-slain with Odin.  Unlike our modern culture, the
    ancients saw no contradiction in this.  She was also a sorceress who
    practiced the shamanic magick known as Seidhr, which she taught to
    Odin.  Freya is the Goddess most often invoked by independent women.
    While she is a Goddess of beauty, she is not dependent on men as is
    the stereotype of so many love Goddesses, but is strong and fiercely
    independent.  She is also known as the Great Dis and probably has
    connections to the family spirits known as the Disir.  In many ways
    she is like Odin in that she is a Goddess of many functions which are
    not always obviously related.  In modern Asatru, many groups have
    replaced Frey with Freya to stand with Odin and Thor on the altar.

    Frigg is a most misunderstood Goddess.  She is the wife of Odin and
    many people are too willing to let her be known simply as that.
    However, the old Norse had a much different idea of the place of women
    and of marriage in general.  While marriages for love were certainly
    known, marriage was also a business and social arrangement and there
    were important duties for a wife.  These were symbolized by a set of
    keys which hung at the belt of all .goodwives.. This symbolized that
    the home was under the control of the woman of the house, who was
    equal to her husband.  Today we think these duties as very minor, but
    a thousand years ago they were far from trivial.  Up until this
    century most of Europe lived in extended families.  A house,
    especially a hall of a warrior, was not merely a small building with a
    nuclear family, but an entire settlement with outbuildings, servants,
    slaves, and an entire clan.  The wife of the house was in charge of
    stores and trading with other clans.  It was she that saw to the
    upkeep of the farm, the balancing of the books, and even to the
    farming itself if her husband was away trading or making war.  It was
    as much a job of managing a business as it was being a .wife.. For
    these reasons Frigg is still very important and can easily be invoked
    beyond the home.  She would, for example, be a natural patron for
    someone who owned a business.  Frigg also shares a lot of
    characteristics with her husband.  She is the only other God who is
    allowed to sit in Odin.s seat from which can be seen all that goes on
    in the nine worlds.  It is said that she knows the future, but remains
    silent, which is entirely in keeping with the way women of the time
    exercised their power: namely indirectly.  While in a better world
    this might not be necessary, it is still an important tool for women
    who must exist in a world where men are sometimes threatened by them.
    While Freya is a Goddess who acts independent of .traditional. roles,
    Frigg is a Goddess who works within those roles, but still maintains
    her power and independence.
    2843

    Other Gods

    There are of course many other Gods and Goddesses.  Some of these have
    important places in the myths, while some others are mentioned only
    once along with their function.

    Loki

    The most perplexing God of Asgard is Loki.  He was probably originally
    a fire God, but he is best known as the troublemaker of Asgard.  In
    various minor scrapes Loki arranges to get the Gods into trouble,
    usually by giving away their treasures and then arranging to return
    them.  This is very much in the traditional role of a trickster, who
    keeps things interesting by causing trouble.  However, it.s sometimes
    difficult to see Loki merely as a trickster because his actions are
    sometimes simply too evil to be ignored.  Balder was the most
    beautiful and beloved of the Gods and a pledge was extracted from all
    the things in the world that they would not harm him.  The sole
    exception to this was the mistletoe which was deemed too tiny to be a
    threat.  Amused by his invulnerability, the Gods took turns throwing
    objects at Balder, which of course had no effect on him.  Loki took
    the blind God Hod and put a spring of mistletoe in his hands and
    guided him to throw it.  The dart pierced Balder.s breast and he died.
    Later a deal was arranged wherein Balder would be allowed to return to
    life if all the creatures of the world would weep for him.  Only one
    refused, an ogress who said she cared not a whit for Balder when he
    was alive and thought him just as well off dead.  The ogress is
    believed to have been Loki in disguise.  For these actions Loki was
    chained beneath the earth and it was arranged that venom would drip
    upon him in punishment that would last until the end of the world.
    With the death of Balder, Loki goes beyond the level of trickster and
    becomes a truly evil figure.  It is known that when Ragnarok comes,
    Loki will lead the legions of chaos against the Aesir and bring about
    the end of the world.

    Indeed Loki.s actions certainly do seem harsh, but they are entirely
    in keeping with the Norse way of looking at things.  One of the
    functions of a trickster God is to keep things going.  The trickster
    causes trouble so that people may evolve, for nothing brings about
    ingenuity like need.  The Norse did not believe anything was eternal.
    The Gods were mortal and only maintained their youth through the
    magick of Idunna.s apples.  In the end they would die in the battle of
    Ragnarok which would destroy the world.  Balder.s invulnerability was
    not natural.  As the Edda says .Cattle die, and men die, and you too
    shall die.... It was deemed much more wise and valiant by the Norse to
    live up to one.s fate than to try to avoid it.  Likewise to return
    from the dead would be equally wrong.  It.s against nature for
    something to be impervious to harm or for the dead to return to life.
    Loki was merely acting as the agent of nature to return things to
    their normal and correct course.  It was not an act of evil, but an
    intervention to stop an evil against the natural order.  Likewise
    Ragnarok must come.  It is in the nature of the world to be destroyed
    and then be reborn.  Loki is merely acting as an agent of fate:
    exactly the function which a trickster is supposed to perform.

    On the other hand, as far as we know Loki was not worshipped, at least
    not in the same way as the other Gods were.  Recognition of his action
    and his place in the universe is essential, but Gods of this type are
    2844

    seldom welcome.  It is .fashionable. today to laugh at trickster Gods
    and see them as a sort of jester figure, but we must not forget that
    their nature is much darker than this even when it does serve a
    purpose.  Change is important, but nothing changes the world faster
    and more thoroughly than war.

    Tyr

    While seldom reckoned today among the most popular of the Gods, Tyr is
    extremely important.  He is the God of battle, of justice, and
    (secondary to Odin) of Kingship.  The most important myth concerning
    Tyr shows both his bravery and honor.  He gave his hand as surety to
    the Fenris Wolf that no trickery was involved in the Gods binding of
    him.  When the fetter in fact did bind the wolf, Tyr lost his hand.
    The honor and reliance on ones word is often overlooked in this myth
    in favor of an interpretation of self sacrifice.  However, throughout
    the myths various deals are made and the Aesir easily get out of them.
    It.s likely that Tyr could have escaped his fate as well, but one.s
    word is one.s word and thus Tyr lost his hand.  Tyr was held to be the
    God of the Thing or assembly.  While the ancient Norse were not truly
    democratic and in fact held slaves, within the noble class all were
    reckoned to be roughly equal.  The Thing was a place where the
    landholders would meet for trade and to iron out disputes among them,
    in the hope of avoiding feuds.  Tyr was originally the chieftain of
    the Aesir and the God of Kingship, but he has been gradually
    supplanted by Odin, especially during the Viking Age.  It is likely
    this was because of Tyr.s strong sense of honor and justice.  For
    raiding and pillaging, Odin, the God of the berserker rage, was a much
    better patron than Tyr, the God of honorable battle.  This is an
    important thing to note about Northern religion: it is extremely
    adaptable.  There are not hard and fast rules about who is what and
    while the nature of the Gods cannot be changed they are more than
    happy to have the aspects most important to their worshippers
    emphasized.  Just as a person uses different skills and .becomes a
    different person. when they move or change jobs, so the Gods too have
    adapted to new climates and needs.

    Baldr

    While we only know the myth of Balder.s death, it is clear that he was
    a God of some importance.  Unfortunately, modern writers, coming from
    a Christian background, have tried to turn Balder into a Christ
    figure.  Balder was a God of beauty and goodness, but his name also
    translates as .warrior.. It is a mistake to turn him into a .Norse
    Jesus.. The mere fact that he died and will return after Ragnarok is
    not enough for this equation.  Another interpretation of Balder is
    that of the dying and resurrected God of the Sun.  This also seems a
    mistake, as Balder does not return from the land of death.  It makes a
    poor symbol to honor Balder on solar holidays, lest the sun not
    return! The remaining major interpretation of Balder is as a God of
    mystic initiation.  While this fits to some extent, we unfortunately
    no longer know.  The equation with Christ has wiped out a great deal
    of lore about Balder and we are left to rediscover his place in our
    modern practice.

    Minor Gods

    Of the other important Gods, Heimdall is the guardian of Asgard.  He,
    2845

    as Rig, is also one of the Gods who fathered mankind.  Njord is the
    God of sailing and sailors.  Unless one travels on the sea, he is
    probably of little importance to you, but if one does sail, he is your
    natural patron.  If Njord is the God of sailing and of man.s use of
    the sea, then Aegir is the God of the sea itself.  He is married to
    Ran who takes drowned sailors to her home after their death.  Aegir is
    considered to be the greatest of brewers, and our kindred honors him
    in a special holiday due to the importance of mead in our modern
    religion.  Bragi is a much overlooked God who is the patron of
    taletellers and bards.  Other Gods more or less overlooked in the
    myths include Forseti, who renders the best judgments, Ull, a God of
    hunting who is the male counter to Skadi, Vithar, the son of Thor who
    is as strong as his father, Vali, Odin.s son who will avenge his
    fathers death at Ragnarok, and Hod, the blind God who was led to slay
    Balder.

    While we might say that certain Gods are more important than others,
    this is in many ways not accurate.  We would be better served to say
    that some are more popular.  The Norse concept of the relationship
    between men and Gods was one of friendship.  A man would honor all the
    Gods as worthy and existent, but would usually find one as his special
    patron.  It is not surprising, considering this, that Thor is the most
    popular of Gods.  If the average person was searching for a God very
    much like himself, Thor would be the obvious choice.  Likewise, a God
    such as Njord would have been extremely important to sailors and
    fishermen, but would have been almost completely unimportant as a
    patron to inlanders.  The less well known Gods are just as powerful as
    their more well known contemporaries, they merely have power over a
    less well known aspect of life.

    There are also many Goddesses other than Frigg and Freya, but we know
    very little of them.  Eir was said to be the greatest of healers, and
    is for this reason very important.  There is no healer God as the
    ancients held that medicine was a craft for women and not for men, but
    modern male healers should certainly invoke her.  While Skadi has a
    very small part in the myths, many modern Asafolk find her a
    compelling figure.  She is the snow-shoe Goddess, who travels in the
    isolated mountains hunting with her bow.  She is married to Njord, but
    they are separated as Njord can.t abide the mountains, and Skadi can.t
    sleep in Njord.s hall where she is kept awake by the pounding of the
    sea.  She is an excellent role model for women who work alone and who
    are independently minded.  Oaths are sworn to the Goddess Var, but
    little else is known of her.  Lofn might some day be of importance to
    you, she is known to bring together lovers who are kept apart by
    circumstance.

    I have merely touched upon the Gods here.  It is important for
    everyone who would practice the religion of the North to get to know
    the myths and the Gods.  An appendix is included which outlines
    various sources for more information.


    Elves & Other Spirits

    The world of ancient Paganism was hardly limited to the worship of the
    Gods.  There are various other beings who were honored, and .Elf
    worship. was often the hardest part of Paganism for Christians to
    destroy.  It was easy enough to substitute one God for another, but it
    2846

    was quite another to tell the common people that the elves which
    brought fertility to the land were not real!

    In the various folktales and sagas we find very little which would
    lead us to a concrete system of what spirit was responsible for
    exactly what.  We are sure of the place of the Valkyries, who were
    responsible for bringing the slain to Valhalla, and also for choosing
    who in battle would die.  They seem, judging by their actions, to be
    supernatural beings of some type.  However, Valkyries appear in
    various places as very human figures and their exact nature is
    difficult to determine.  Sigrdrifa was a Valkyrie who was cursed by
    Odin because she refused to bring victory in battle to those whom he
    had chosen.  Her punishment was to be married to a mortal, and the
    implication is clear that this would end her days as a Valkyrie.  It.s
    equally clear that she has great knowledge of the runes as she tutors
    Sigurd after he awakens her.  In most respects she seems to be a
    normal human woman, although a very wise and independent one with
    great powers.  Elsewhere, Voland and his brothers are said to have
    found three Valkyries sunning themselves without their swan-coats.
    When the brothers steal their feather-coats and hide them, the
    Valkyries again appear as otherwise normal women.  This does not seem
    entirely in keeping with a supernatural origin, and it.s possible that
    some kind of magickal order of Priestesses has become confused over
    time with the supernatural beings we know as Valkyries.  The swan-coat
    seems very similar in description to Freya.s falcon-coat and the
    entire issue may be something related to the practice of seidhr.  As
    far as we know, the Valkyrie were not worshipped as such, but were
    considered more the messengers of Odin.  They also serve the mead at
    Valhalla, and because of this whoever pours the mead into the Horn at
    Blot or Sumbel is today known as .the Valkyrie..

    The other spirits whose place seems fairly clear are the Disir.  These
    are spirits who are intimately linked with a family.  There is also
    some indication that they are linked with the land, but this would be
    in keeping with the old ways.  We forget sometimes that many
    landowners in Europe have been living in the same place since before
    this continent was discovered.  The land becomes an intimate part of
    the family and its identity, so it is natural that family spirits
    would also oversee the family land.  Disir inevitably are seen as
    women who appear at times of great trouble or change.  They are
    somehow linked to the family bloodline, and seem most closely linked
    to the clanchief.  There is one scene in one saga where a spirit,
    apparently a Dis, is passed on from one person to another who are not
    blood relations.  However, these two friends are closer than brothers,
    so while the link is apparently not genetic, it is definitely
    familial.  We know the family Disir were honored with blots at the
    Winter Nights and that they have great power to aid their family.  As
    far as their origin, it.s possible that they are ancestral in origin.
    They may be ancestors whose power was so great that they were able to
    continue to see to their clan.  Or it.s possible that the Disir are
    the collective spirit of the family ancestors.  Freya is called the
    great Dis and there may be some linkage here to her position as a
    seidhrwoman.  We know from the sagas that Seidhr was involved with
    talking to various spirits (including the dead) and its possible that
    this is the source of Freya.s name.  It is also possible that she
    performed much the same function as a Dis to her tribe the Vanir.

    Closely linked to the idea of the Disir is the Fylgia.  These spirits
    2847

    are attached to an individual person in much the same way that the
    Disir are associated with a family.  Fylgia usually appear either as
    animals or as beautiful women.  They correspond to the .fetch,.
    .totem,. or .power-animal. in other cultures.  Most of the time the
    fylgia remains hidden and absent, it is only with truly great or
    powerful persons that the fylgia becomes known.  They may have
    something to do with Seidhr as well, because many sagas offer evidence
    of spirit travel in the shape of animals.  This corresponds exactly to
    notions of shamanism found in other cultures.

    The remaining spirits include Alvar or elves, Dokkalvar or dark elves
    or Dwarfs, kobolds, and landvaettir.  While some have defined one
    being as doing one thing and another serving a different function, I.m
    not inclined to draw very sharp distinctions between these various
    creatures.  They all seem .elfish. in origin, and there seems to me to
    be no pattern of associating one name with a specific function.  We
    know that various landvaettir or land spirits were honored with blots.
    We also know that Frey is the lord of Alfheim, one of the nine worlds
    where the alvar are said to live.

    Of all the remaining spirits, the dwarfs are the most consistent in
    description.  We know that the dwarfs are cunning and misanthropic in
    character and incredible smiths, capable of creating magickal objects
    so valuable they are considered the greatest treasures of Asgard.
    Thor.s hammer Mjolnir, Freya.s necklace Brisingamen, and Sif.s golden
    hair are all creations of the dwarfs.  They live beneath the earth and
    have little to do with mankind or the Gods unless one seeks them out.
    What place they had in the religion we no longer know.  It would seem
    wise to invoke them as spirits of the forge, but I can think of little
    other reason to disturb them.

    Elves are the most difficult magickal race to pin down.  Mythological
    sources tell us that the Alvar or light elves live in Alfheim where
    Frey is their Lord.  However, we also have the enduring belief in
    folklore of the elves as faery-folk: beings associated with the
    natural world.  These two conceptions of elves might still be linked,
    however, as Alfheim is known to be a place of incredible natural
    beauty, and Frey, their leader, is an agricultural deity.  To further
    confuse this issue, Norse folklore has a strong belief in the
    Landvaettir, or land spirits who may fit into either or both of these
    categories.  I.m inclined to lump them all together as similar beings
    that we simply don.t know enough about to tell apart.  What is
    important is that Asatru, like all Pagan religions, honors the natural
    world and the earth very deeply.  Whether one calls the spirits of the
    land as the elves, the faeries, or the landvaettir, or uses all of
    these terms interchangably, respect is all important.  Asatru is known
    for being one of the most politically .conservative. of the modern
    Pagan religions, but you.ll find few of us who aren.t staunch
    environmentalists.

    One of the most important spirits to honor is the house-spirit.
    Folklore is also filled with stories of various spirits variously
    called faeries, elves, kobolds, brownies, tom-tin, etc who inhabit a
    house and see to its proper conduct.  In the usual form of the tale,
    they offer to perform some housekeeping functions, but eventually turn
    on the owners of the house when they are insulted by overpayment.  We
    don.t have any concrete evidence for how our ancestors honored these
    beings, but this is not surprising because such a thing would not be a
    2848

    public observance and it.s unlikely it would be recorded in the sagas
    or Eddas.  Folklore indicates that such beings should be honored with
    a simple bowl of milk or perhaps beer, but no more.

    In general folklore does not paint the various elves and spirits as
    particularly benevolent figures.  With the exception of house spirits,
    who as spirits of a manmade object are bound to us on some level, they
    seem most interested in staying out of the dealings of mankind.  There
    are numerous stories of people who spy upon elf women and force them
    to become their brides.  Inevitably the women are unhappy and
    eventually escape, leaving their husbands devastated.  There are also
    numerous stories of spirits who haunt the woods and who will drag
    wayward travelers into rivers to drown or to some other untimely
    death.  When people do have dealings with the elves these beings seem
    to operate on an entirely different set of expectations than we do.
    Most of us would be gratified by the gift of a .bonus. from our
    employer, yet time and time again in folklore this is the easiest way
    to anger a house spirit.  We know that elves were honored with blots,
    but it.s just as possible that these ceremonies were made in
    propitiation to them rather than in kinship as are our blots made with
    the Gods.  We suggest caution in dealing with beings with a set of
    values so foreign from our own.  They should be approached in the same
    way one would approach a person from a country whose ways are very
    different.

    In general, we.re also very reticent to make decisions about
    classifying the various .other peoples.. It would be very easy to draw
    lines and place certain spirits into little boxes which label their
    function, but that seems overly mechanical and of little utility.
    Elves and other .wights. are not human, and it might be too much to
    try to classify them in other than subjective terms.  It.s probably
    best to simply make your intent clear, experiment, and use the terms
    which work for you, remembering only to be true to the sources.

    Demi-Gods

    There are a whole classification of Gods which are not truly part of
    the Aesir, Vanir, or even the Jotunn.  Wayland the Smith is the best
    example of this that we can offer.  Wayland, called Volund in the
    Norse version, is the greatest of smiths, but it.s clear in the
    mythology that he was more or less a human man.  The myth tells of how
    he lost his wife and was enslaved by a human King.  While his powers
    allow him to outwit and take vengeance on the king, it.s clear
    throughout that he.s not on the level of a Thor or an Odin.  What one
    does about these demi-Gods or local Gods is a good question.  I see
    nothing wrong with pouring a blot in their honor and dealing with them
    as you would any other God or Goddess.  On the other hand, they are
    not part of the Aesir and I think it might be disrespectful to honor
    them with the Aesir or as part of a ceremony dedicated to the Aesir as
    they seem of a different nature.

    Ancestor Worship:

    Honoring ones ancestors was one of the most sacred duties of the
    Norsemen.  One of the most important parts of greeting new people was
    the exchanging of personal lineages at sumbel.  The worship of the
    Disir is closely linked to ancestor worship.  However, it is difficult
    for modern day Pagans to seriously engage in ancestor worship.  We are
    2849

    for the most part without a strong connection to our heritage, and
    even if we feel motivated we would probably need to skip at least a
    thousand years back to find ancestors who would not have been appalled
    by our Heathen beliefs.  One substitution for ancestor worship in the
    modern Asatru movement has been the veneration of heros from the Sagas
    and legends of our people.

    The manner of how we honor ancestors is also somewhat troubling.  I
    reserve the blot ritual to Gods and other powers, and I.m not sure if
    it.s appropriate to pour a blot to an ancestor, no matter how
    important he was.  It.s touchy when you are honoring someone that you
    knew was a mortal.  I think the most important part of ancestor
    worship is remembering, and the sumbel seems the most important part
    of that.

    While we discuss ancestry, I must mention that some modern Asatru
    groups, in part because of holdovers from 19th century cultural
    movements, have placed a great deal of emphasis on ancestry in terms
    of race.  Many have held that Asatru was a religion for whites or
    Northern Europeans only.  In my not particularly humble opinion, this
    is pure idiocy.  The basic argument for this is that people of other
    cultures do not share the same background and values.  This is
    certainly true, but the key word in my opinion is culture, and all
    Americans by definition share a culture.  Also, while I admit I would
    think it doubtful that people from outside of our own cultural
    heritage would be attracted greatly to Asatru, if they are it is for a
    reason and they should be welcomed and not shunned.  It proves the
    worth of our religion and way of life that it is so strong that one
    would leave his own cultural path behind to take up ours.

    As far as culture is concerned, the ancestry of the ancient North is
    alive and well in modern America.  A thousand years ago settlers
    sailed to Iceland to avoid the growing influence of powerful kings and
    centralized government.  This centralization of power was one of the
    things which Roman Christianity brought with it.  Two hundred years
    ago we in America rebelled against our king for much the same reasons.
    Our culture is much more profoundly influenced by the Vikings than
    most would care to admit.  Our law is based on English common law,
    which in turn has roots in Norman and Saxon law.  (Both the Saxons and
    Normans were descended from Germanic tribes.) Our culture is based on
    many of the same ideas which the Northmen held dear: the importance of
    the individual and the belief that individual rights outweighed
    collective rights.  Thus, it is my assertion that we are all
    descended, at least in part, spiritually from the ancient Norse.

    The Jotunn

    The Jotunn or giants are the sworn enemies of the Gods.  While the
    Aesir represent order and the Vanir represent the supportive powers of
    nature, the Jotunn represent chaos and the power of nature to destroy
    man and act independent of humankind.  In the end, it is the Jotunn
    who will fight the Gods at Ragnarok and bring about the destruction of
    the world.

    In essence despite being called Giants or Ogres, the Jotunn are Gods
    just as much as the Aesir or Vanir.  In many cases they correspond
    very closely to the Fomoire in Celtic mythology.  Most simply put, the
    Jotunn are the Gods of all those things which man has no control over.
    2850

    The Vanir are the Gods of the growing crops, the Jotunn are the Gods
    of the river which floods and washes away those crops or the tornado
    which destroys your entire farm.  This is why they are frightening and
    this is why we hold them to be evil.

    The Jotunn are not worshipped in modern Asatru, but there is some
    evidence that sacrifices were made to them in olden times.  In this
    case, sacrifices were probably made .to them. rather than shared .with
    them. as was the case with the Vanir and Aesir.  It would be
    inappropriate to embrace them as friends and brothers in the way we
    embrace our Gods.  One doesn.t embrace the hurricane or the wildfire;
    it is insanity to do so.  However, we must also remember that fact
    that we see their actions as bad, they are not inherently evil.  The
    storm destroys the crops, but it also brings cleansing and renewal.
    We humans are only one species on this planet and in the end we are
    both expendable and irrelevant to nature.  This is the manner in which
    the Jotunn act, and it is not surprising that we see this as evil.

    However, one must also take into account the premonitions of Ragnarok
    recorded in the eddas.  If the Jotunn are merely amoral, why are they
    the sworn enemy of the Aesir and why will they bring about the end of
    the world? It.s possible that Jotunn was more of a catch-all term for
    dangerous Gods rather than a reference to a specific family.  (It is
    the case in many languages that there is one word for people that
    speak the language, usually translating as .people,. and another term
    for those persons of other cultures and tribes.) The dangerous forces
    of nature are .Jotunn. because we cannot control them, but there are
    other forces, principally those of chaos, that are considered .Jotunn.
    as well.

    There is abundant evidence for this in the Eddas.  Various Jotunn are
    seen to marry into the Aesir without a great deal of trouble from the
    Gods, but at other times the mere sight of one throws Thor into a
    rage.  The obvious conclusion is that they are more than one specific
    race of deities.  The destructive powers of nature were tolerated to
    some extent, and often married into the Aesir bringing them more under
    control.  However, other .outlander. Gods were completely destructive
    to the Aesir (and thus mankind) and the Gods only thought for them was
    death.


    The Religious Structure of Asatru

    The ancients, for the most part, did not have an organized system of
    Temples or churches in the way that our society does today.  Religion
    was a very personal affair, mostly between the Gods and their
    worshippers.  If there was a formalized temple or perhaps a grove that
    was dedicated to the Gods and tended as a temple it was most likely
    built by a wealthy landowner and dedicated to his or her patron God.
    Such a person would then, usually, become the Gothi (Priest) or Gythia
    (Priestess) of the temple.  Such temples were generally maintained by
    the family after the builders death, the title being more or less
    inherited by whomever was lord over the land.

    Today most Asatru groups are similarly unstructured.  This has been a
    problem because there is little in the way of religious education
    other than in books such as this one and personal research.  While
    this sort of learning is fine, there are always some things left out
    2851

    and I.m sure that mine will be no exception.  There are a few groups
    who are attempting to initiate training programs and present sets of
    standards for people who would declare themselves to be Gothi or
    Gythia, but these groups have unfortunately been somewhat inflexible
    and dogmatic, seeming more interested in creating hierarchies than
    with service to the Folk or Gods.

    Gothi is a honorary title only.  It does not mark any administrative
    power or rank within Asatru.  One would probably not call oneself
    Gothi unless one had some experience of deity and had led many
    rituals, but as it entails power over no one and it is up to no one to
    comment on ones qualifications or abilities.  Similarly there is no
    need for someone to be a Gothi or to have access to one in order to
    practice our faith.  While the more experienced might get more things
    .right. in the ritual, this is purely subjective and if your heart is
    true to the Gods this is enough.

    Most persons who were given the title Gothi in the old days were
    dedicated to a single God.  The title most often formed their last
    name: Thorolf Thorsgothi for example.  This dedication to a God or
    Goddess was usually part of one.s family heritage and was passed down
    to your children.  While there is no compelling reason why one cannot
    act as Priest to the entire community of Gods and Goddesses, it is
    most common for one to be dedicated to a single deity.  A kindred may
    have persons who are each dedicated to a different deity, or it may
    orient itself towards a single deity as did families in the Sagas.

    The most basic unit of Asatru religious worship is the hearth or
    homestead.  This is nothing more than it sounds like: a household of
    Asafolk who worship the old Gods and Goddesses.  Several individuals
    or hearths may group themselves into a .kindred,. which is a term that
    has many meanings to many different groups.  Some kindreds have many
    members and function like mainstream churches, others are more
    familylike and attempt to hold to their privacy.  The place of a
    kindred is more or less analogous to a clan or small tribal group.  A
    kindred is made up of people you are familiar with and with whom you
    meet in person and in it.s best sense it.s an organic grouping,
    however it.s not the same sort of bonding that one would find in a
    single family or even in an extremely close knit group of friends.  In
    a true Pagan society, the kindred would be found on the level of a
    farmstead or small village.

    The ritual blots are most commonly done on the level of the kindred,
    or in meetings where more than one kindred comes together.  The
    rituals of a Hearth might be less formalized and more .homey. in
    atmosphere.  The blot ritual is based on a religious observance that
    was part of the official public aspect of ancient Asatru, and its
    likely that there were many other private rituals that would not
    necessarily be appropriate for a kindred to take part in together.
    For example, a kindred might not honor the individual family Dis or
    the house-spirits unless all members of the kindred lived together or
    were tied by blood as well as companionship.

    Most persons will want to join or found a kindred in their area,
    however, before one runs out and begins to solicit people, you should
    think about what you are doing.  The very name of our groupings,
    .kindred,. implies a great deal more than does membership in a church.
    Today we are accustomed to religious institutions that are more or
    2852

    less anonymous and sterile.  A kindred should not be this way.  While
    we must be open to all, we need not act as if we were a public
    facility with no more intimacy than a department store.  It is best to
    start small and gather people as they come to you.  Once you are
    established, get involved in the local Pagan community if you are not
    already.  Attend a few events of the local Leif Erikson society or the
    Sons of Norway.  Open one of your blots to the public and take note of
    people who are attracted to Asatru.  A kindred is something which
    should form organically and cannot be pushed.  On the other hand,
    Asatru is not a secret religion or one open only to .initiates. as
    many Neo-Pagan faiths are.  We must be open to outsiders who are truly
    interested.  I am just cautioning against throwing people into a
    kindred because they are available or it is the only group around or
    they are too polite to say no.  A roommate of mine related to me a
    conversation he had with another person at an Asatru gathering.  The
    person remarked that .this is all very nice, but when do you think Joe
    will get tired of this stuff.. My roommate being a seriously committed
    Heathen straightened him out.  The person in question was just a
    friend of Joe.s who went to Pagan events because of Joe.s interest.
    He assumed that the rest of the group was .humoring Joe. just as he
    was.  The moral of this story is that if people are not interested,
    there.s nothing you can do about it.  We.re not the Christians who
    want anybody and everybody to join our faith, and we should pay just
    as much attention to dissuading the dabblers and the kooks as we do to
    attracting those who truly do have the love of the Old Gods in their
    hearts.

    As to what makes one a Gothi, the requirements would vary from group
    to group.  Some might have written criteria, while others might leave
    it up to the persons heart.  Certainly a Gothi is one who has a long
    term relationship with the Gods and Goddesses.  One does not, for
    example, simply read this book and then proclaim oneself Gothi! (I am
    writing this book and don.t consider myself to be a Gothi.) A
    competent Gothi should have studied the Eddas and Sagas and know the
    history of our religion.  He or she should also know a bit about the
    runes, and the other mysteries of our tradition.  One should also note
    that this is a public office and the Gothi of old had responsibilities
    as leaders of the community.  Most importantly one must be sincerely
    dedicated.  There.s no push to move to a .higher. level of the
    Priesthood as there are in religions or magickal orders with .degree
    systems. and if you do not feel compelled to take on the
    responsibilities of being a Gothi or Gythia, there is no need for you
    to and much to say that you should not.


    The Values of Asatru

    One of the basic functions of a religion is to offer a set of values
    on which mankind is to base it's actions.  This, sadly, is one area
    where Paganism has often failed.  The cult of anti-values has held
    sway, taking moral relativism to extremes perhaps even farther from
    common sense than fundamentalist moral legalism, even to the point
    where I have heard rape, murder, and genocide defended on the basis of
    "cultural differences."

    However, values remain important.  All one needs to do is look at the
    morning paper to see the results of a society that has in many ways
    embraced the cult of anti-values.  Thievery, murder, and plunder exist
    2853

    in our cities to extents which would have appalled our ancestors.no
    matter how many times they went a' Viking.  While this is hardly what
    the Pagans who have embraced the cult of anti-values had in mind, it
    is to my belief a natural outgrowth of the same basic philosophical
    concept.  The chaos in our country is the dark shadow of the modern
    rejection of moral legalism.  What should have been an evolution from
    a legalistic moral/religious culture to one of flexible honor based
    values and self-responsibility has instead become a morass of chaos
    and immorality.  The lesson we should all learn is that while there is
    no definitive list of sins; right and wrong still exist.

    As usual Asatru offers a sensible solution.  Our faith deals not in
    legalisms and rules nor in unchecked chaos and relativism.  We instead
    acknowledge the existence of right and wrong, good and evil, but we
    deal with actions according to basic philosophical concepts that are
    applied by the keen intellect of Odin, the simple common sense of
    Thor, and the solid honor of Tyr.the gifts of the Gods to us.

    Asatru posits that the basic place of moral judgment is within the
    human heart and mind.  We as human beings with the gift of
    intelligence are sensible and responsible enough to determine right
    from wrong and act accordingly.  The Gods teach us through the
    examples of their lives, as chronicled in the Eddas, and through
    various pieces such as the Havamal which directly offer us advice.  In
    the modern history of our faith, various Asatru organizations have
    outlined simple sets of values which they hold up as simple guidelines
    on how to live ones life.

    The Odinic Rite (the major Asatru group in England) has one of the
    most cohesive and sensible of all those we've seen and this set has
    been adopted by the Raven Kindred as an "official" statement of our
    beliefs.  We do this not only as a moral guide for our members, but
    also to say to the world what it is that we stand for.our good name in
    the community being important to us.  Finally, this list is used when
    someone formally joins the Raven Kindred and we hold a sumble and
    toast the 9 virtues to the new member in the hope that they will apply
    them to their life.

    The Odinic Rite lists the 9 Noble Virtues as Courage, Truth, Honor,
    Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Industriousness, Self-Reliance, and
    Perseverance.

    It would be hard to get much argument on any of these values from
    anyone.  They simply and briefly encapsulate the broad wisdom of our
    Gods and ancestors.

    Courage

    In virtually every statement of values applied to Asatru, Courage is
    listed first.  As Stephen McNallen has said, courage and bravery are
    perhaps the values which the Vikings are best known for.  However,
    despite our history, few of us face such turmoil as a literal battle
    for ones life.  In fact, I believe it might be easier to manifest
    courage in such a situation than to do so in the many smaller day to
    day occurrences in which courage is called for.

    The most common of these occurrences for modern Pagans, is the courage
    to acknowledge and live ones beliefs.  It is also, sadly, the one that
    2854

    we most often fail at.  While we may often be full of the type of
    courage that would lead us to face a shield wall, many of us quake at
    the thought of the topic of religion coming up at the office or a
    friend asking what church we attend.  We won't offer easy answers, but
    we ask this: if you toast the courage of your ancestors to fight and
    die for what they believed in, can you trade away your religious
    identity for a higher salary or social acceptance?

    In an essay on values there is also the question of moral courage.
    The way of Tyr is difficult.to lose ones hand for ones beliefs.but,
    Tyr thought the price worth paying.  In a million ways modern society
    challenges our values, not just as Asatruar who are estranged from
    mainstream religious practice, but for religious people in an
    increasingly not just secular, but anti-religious culture.  Values are
    also not in favor in modern society.  Breaking or getting around the
    rules is encouraged to get ahead.  Living honorably is simply too
    inconvenient.  I think most people, Asatru or otherwise, find this
    repugnant, but the only way to change it is to have the courage to
    refuse to take part in it.

    Truth

    The second virtue, that of Truth, is the one that most led our kindred
    to embrace the Odinic Rite's statement of values as our own.  Early in
    our discussions, we decided that no matter what values we chose to
    hold out as our own, truth must be among them.  It is a word that
    holds so much in its definition, and includes such a wide variety of
    moral and philosophical beliefs that we were all drawn to it as a
    simple statement of what we stood for.

    At least one of the reasons we wanted to adopt it was the simple issue
    of honesty.  As Bill Dwinnels said at a recent sumbel while toasting
    truth and honesty: if you don't want people to know about something,
    don't do it.  Truth, in the sense of honesty, is essential to personal
    honor and also to any system or morality that is not based on rigid
    legalism.  If one is to uphold an honor code, one must be brutally
    honest with oneself and with others.

    Truth is also the Truth that comes with a capital T.the kind of Truth
    that one talks about in terms of religion or morality.  It's common to
    talk of different peoples having different "truths," but it's equally
    important to remember that while we acknowledge that each person or
    people has their own belief as to what Truth is or where to find it,
    there finally is a single Truth.  This is not the Truth as we believe
    it, but ultimate Truth.  While we may respect other people's .truths.
    and seek our own, we must never forget our search for The Truth.  Like
    the Holy Grail of Christian legend, it may never be ours to reach, but
    when we cease to search we perish.

    Honor

    Honor is the basis for the entire Asatru moral rationale.  If anything
    comes out in the Eddas and Sagas it is that without honor we are
    nothing.  We remember two types of peoples from ancient times: those
    whose honor was so clean that they shine as examples to us and those
    who were so without honor that their names are cursed a thousand years
    after they lived.  Good Asatruar should always strive to be among the
    former.
    2855

    However, honor is not mere reputation.  Honor is an internal force
    whose outward manifestation is reputation.  Internal honor is the
    sacred moral compass that each Asatruar and God should hold dear.  It
    is the inner dwelling at peace which comes from living in accordance
    with ones beliefs and with ones knowledge of the Truth of what one is
    doing.  It is something deeply personal and heartfelt, almost akin to
    an emotion.  It's a .knowing. that what one is doing is right and
    decent and correct.

    In many ways while the most important of all the virtues it is also
    the most ephemeral in terms of description.  It is all the other
    virtues rolled together and then still more.  The best way I have
    found to describe honor is that if you are truly living with honor,
    you will have no regrets about what you have done with your life.

    Fidelity

    Fidelity is a word that is far too often defined by it's narrow use in
    terms of marital fidelity.  By the dictionary it simply means being
    faithful to someone or something.  In marriage this means being true
    to ones vows and partner, and this has been narrowly defined as
    limiting ones sexual experience to ones spouse.  While I have found
    this to be great practical advice, many treat fidelity as if there
    were no other ways in which one could be faithful or unfaithful.

    For we Asatruar fidelity is most important in terms of our faith and
    troth to the Gods.  We must remain true to the Aesir and Vanir and to
    our kinsmen.  Like marriage, Profession (the rite in which one enters
    the Asatru faith, similar to Christian confirmation or Wiccan
    initiation) is a sacred bond between two parties; in this case an
    Asatruar and the Gods.  In order for such a relationship to work, both
    must be honest and faithful to each other.

    Asatru, although currently being reborn, is at its roots a folk
    religion and we also uphold the value of fidelity to the ways of our
    ancestors.  This is why historical research is so important to the
    Asatru-folk: it is the rediscovering of our ancient ways and our
    readoption of them.

    Discipline

    In any discussion of the values of Asatru, discipline is best
    described as self-discipline.  It is the exercise of personal will
    that upholds honor and the other virtues and translates impulse into
    action.  If one is to be able to reject moral legalism for a system of
    internal honor, one must be willing to exercise the self-discipline
    necessary to make it work.  Going back to my earlier criticism of
    society, if one rejects legalism, one must be willing to control ones
    own actions.  Without self-discipline, we have the mess we currently
    see in our culture.

    Looking at discipline in terms of fidelity, we see a close connection.
    Many Pagans go from faith to faith, system to system, path to path.
    Asatruar are much less likely to do this.  The discipline of keeping
    faith with our Gods and the ways of our ancestors is part of our
    modern practice.  In this way, we limit ourselves in some ways, but we
    gain much more in others.

    2856

    Hospitality

    Hospitality is simply one of the strongest core values at the heart of
    virtually every ancient human civilization.  In a community/folk
    religion such as our own, it is the virtue that upholds our social
    fabric.  In ancient times it was essential that when a traveler went
    into the world he could find some sort of shelter and welcome for the
    night.  In modern times it is just as essential that a traveler find
    friendship and safety.

    In our modern Asatru community, we need to treat each other with
    respect and act together for the good of our community as a whole.
    This functions most solidly on the level of the kindred or hearth
    where nonfamilial members become extremely close and look out for
    each other.  It can mean hospitality in the old sense of taking in
    people, which we've done, but in modern times it's more likely to mean
    loaning someone a car or a bit of money when they need it (that's
    need, not want).

    Part of hospitality is treating other people with respect and dignity.
    Many of our Gods are known to wander the world and stop in at people's
    houses, testing their hospitality and generosity.  The virtue of
    hospitality means seeing people as if they were all individuals with
    self-respect and importance.  Or perhaps from time to time, they are
    literally the Gods in human form.  This has profound implications for
    social action in our religion.  Our response to societal problems such
    as poverty (that's poverty folks, not laziness) is in many ways our
    modern reaction to this ancient virtue.

    In terms of our modern community as a whole, I see hospitality in
    terms of frontier "barn raisings" where a whole community would come
    together and pool their resources.  This doesn't mean we have to
    forget differences, but we must put them aside for those who are of
    our Folk, and work for our common good.

    Industriousness

    Modern Asatruar must be industrious in their actions.  We need to work
    hard if we are going to achieve our goals.  There is so much for us to
    do.  We've set ourselves the task of restoring Asatru to it's former
    place as a mainstream faith and by doing so reinvigorating our society
    and culture.  We can't do this by sitting on our virtues, we need to
    make them an active part of our behavior.  Industry also refers to
    simple hard work in our daily vocations, done with care and pride.

    Here's a few concrete examples.  If you are reading this and don't
    have a kindred, why not?  Stop reading now.  Go and place ads in the
    appropriate local stores, get your name on the Ring of Troth, Wyrd
    Network, or Asatru Alliance networking lists, and with other Pagan
    groups.  Put on a workshop.  Ok, now you're back to reading and you
    don't agree with what I'm saying here?  Well, be industrious!  Write
    your own articles and arguments.  Write a letter to the editor and
    suggest this material be banned.better that than passivity.  Get the
    blood moving and go out and do it.  That's how it gets done.  The Gods
    do not favor the lazy.

    The same holds true for our non-religious lives.  As Asatruar we
    should offer a good example as industrious people who add to whatever
    2857

    we're involved in rather than take from it.  We should be the ones the
    business we work in can't do without and the ones who always seem to
    be able to get things done.  When people think of Asatru, they should
    think of people who are competent and who offer something to the
    world.

    This doesn.t just apply to vocational work, but to the entire way we
    live our lives.  It is just as much a mentality.  The Vikings were
    vital people.  They lived each day to its fullest and didn.t wring
    their hands in doubt or hesitation.  We should put the same attitude
    forward in all that we do whether it is our usual vocation, devotion
    to the Gods, or leisure time.

    Self Reliance

    Industry brings us directly to the virtue of Self-Reliance, which is
    important both in practical and traditional terms.  Going back to the
    general notion of this article, we are dealing with a form of morality
    that is largely self-imposed and thus requires self-reliance.  We rely
    on ourselves to administer our own morality.

    Traditionally, our folkways have always honored the ability of a man
    or woman to make their own way in the world and not to lean on others
    for their physical needs.  This is one of the ways in which several
    virtues reinforce and support each other.  Hospitality cannot function
    if people are not responsible enough to exercise discipline and take
    care of themselves.  It's for those that strive and fail or need
    assistance that hospitality is intended, not for the idle who simply
    won't take care of themselves.

    In terms of our relationships with the Gods, self-reliance is also
    very important.  If we wish the Gods to offer us their blessings and
    gifts, we must make ourselves worthy of them.and the Gods are most
    pleased with someone who stands on their own two feet.  This is one of
    the reasons for the Asatru .rule. that we do not kneel to the Gods
    during our ceremonies.  By standing we acknowledge our relationship as
    striving and fulfilled people looking for comradeship and a
    relationship, rather than acting as scraelings looking for a handout
    from on high.  It takes very little for a God to attract a follower,
    if worship simply means getting on the gravy train.  We, as Asatruar,
    are people who can make our own way in the world, but who choose to
    seek a relationship with the Gods.

    In mundane terms being self-reliant is a simple way to allow ourselves
    the ability to live as we wish to.  In simple economic terms, if one
    has enough money in the bank one doesn't need to worry as much about
    being fired due to religious discrimination.  We can look a bigot in
    the face and tell him just where he can put it.  It's also nice to
    have something in the bank to lay down as a retainer on a good lawyer
    so we can take appropriate action.

    On the other side of this is self-reliance in the sense of Henry David
    Thoreau, who advocated a simple lifestyle that freed one from the
    temptations of materialism.  Again, here we are able to live as we
    wish with those things that are truly important.  Religious people
    from all faiths have found that adjusting ones material desires to
    match one's ability to meet them leaves one open for a closer
    relationship with deity and a more fulfilling life.  While our
    2858

    ancestors were great collectors of gold goodies, they didn.t lust for
    possessions in and of themselves, but for what they stood for and
    could do for them.  In fact, the greatest thing that could be said of
    a Lord was that he was a good .Ring Giver..

    Being self-reliant also means taking responsibility for ones life.
    It's not just about refusing a welfare check or not lobbying for a tax
    exemption, but also refusing to blame ones failures on religious
    intolerance, the patriarchy, or an unfair system.  The system may, in
    fact, be unfair, but it's our own responsibility to deal with it.

    In societal terms, we have become much too dependent on other people
    for our own good.  As individuals we look to the government or to
    others to solve our problems and as a society we borrow billions from
    our descendants to pay for today's excesses.  Most problems in this
    world could be solved if people just paid their own way as they went.

    Perseverance

    The final virtue is Perseverance which I think most appropriate
    because it is the one that we most need to keep in mind in our living
    of the other values.  Our religion teaches us that the world is an
    imperfect place, and nothing comes easy.  We need to continue to seek
    after that which we desire.  In this imperfect world there are no free
    lunches or easy accomplishments.especially in the subjects we have set
    before ourselves.  If we truly wish to build an Asatru community that
    people will hold up as an example of what committed people can do,
    then we must persevere through the hardships that building our
    religion is going to entail.  We must be willing to continue on when
    we are pushed back.  If one loses a job for ones religion, the answer
    is not to go back and hide, but to continue until one finds a vocation
    where one can more forward and live as an Asatruar should.

    Finally we must persevere when we simply fail.  If one's kindred falls
    apart because of internal strife, one should go back and start over.
    Pick up the pieces and continue on.  If nobody had done this after the
    disintegration of the Asatru Free Assembly, this would probably never
    have been written.  We must be willing to continue in the hard work of
    making our religion strong.not just when it is convenient and easy to
    do so, but when it gets hard, inconvenient, or just plain boring.  To
    accomplish without striving is to do little, but to persevere and
    finally accomplish a hard fought goal brings great honor.

    Hailing the Sun: A Sample Blot to honor Sunna at the Summer Solstice

    This ritual would be ideally performed at sunrise on the day of the
    summer Solstice.  If possible the folk should gather while it is still
    dark or even better, remain awake throughout the night in vigil.  A
    secondary time would be at noon on the Solstice.  This ritual should
    not be performed at night.

    At any point in this ritual, within the realm of logic and dramatic
    flow, the parts marked as Gothi and Gythia may be shared among the
    2859

    folk.  In addition, the parts are not necessarily sex specific, but
    the terminology is used as a convenience.

    Set Up: An altar should be placed in the center and the folk should
    form a circle around it, leaving space in the center for the .action.
    to take place.  For this ritual you will need some sort of mead or
    beer, a horn or chalice, an offering bowl, a hammer for consecrations,
    and a wheel of some sort, preferably a wagon wheel to symbolize the
    turning of the wheel of the year.  Any reasonable tools may be
    substituted.  The Wheel is placed on the ground near the altar or on
    the altar with candles around the rim (unlit).

    Consecration of space

    The Gothi goes to the center of the folk and forms the invocational
    position of the elhaz rune, both hands in the air at a rough 45.
    angle.

    Gothi: We gather here to honor our sacred lady Sunna, who on this
    Solstice Morning, reaches her height of power.  All hail Sunna!

    All: Hail Sunna!

    The Gythia takes the hammer and walks to each of the four corners and
    consecrates the space.

    Gythia: Hammer, hallow and hold this holy stead, that it will be a
    fitting place for our worship of our sacred lady Sunna! Hammar, Helga
    ve thetta ok hindra alla illska!

    Gythia returns hammer to altar and faces the altar.

    Gythia: I consecrate and hallow this altar to the work of our sacred
    lady Sunna! Here on this Solstice morning may the might of the Gods be
    brought to our holy stead.  May the warm light of Sunna heat our
    hearts and hold our spirits.

    Gothi: Our holy lady watches and waits for the blot in her honor.
    Hail Sunna!

    All: Hail Sunna!

    (At this point it would be most appropriate for a song or reading to
    be performed.  It should obviously be about Sunna or the sun or
    something appropriate to the day.)

    Invocation

    Gythia: Our lady Sunna is the light of knowledge, the warmth of love,
    and the heat of our passion.  Let us spend a moment in silence,
    contemplating those things which she brings us.

    Leave a few moments for silent prayers and meditation.

    Gothi: Holy Sunna.  Lady of the Sun.  Light of the heavens.  Ever
    pursued and ever free.  We gather to greet and welcome you and offer
    you gifts on this day.  We offer to you our prayers and love, our
    devotion and strength, our kinship and honor.
    2960

    All face the sun and form the elhaz posture.

    All: Hail to thee Sunna, light of Har newly risen.  She whose holy
    light shone upon our ancestors of old and she who.s light will shine
    upon our children.  We give you hail and welcome.  Fill our hearts on
    this Solstice morning with your warm rays that your fires may burn in
    our hearts throughout the year.  Hail Sunna!

    A few moments of silence are appropriate here.

    Blot

    Gothi: Now it is time to offer sacrifice to our holy lady.

    Gythia takes horn and Gothi fills it with mead.  Gythia holds horn
    above her head, in the direction of the sun.

    Gythia: Here is our sacrifice, the essence of our love and spirit.  We
    offer it to you as a token of our kinship and our love.  As you drink
    of it, may your power fill this holy hlaut and feed our spirits.

    Gythia drinks from the horn and it is then passed around the folk,
    each taking a drink, with the horn returning to the Gythia.

    Gythia: Hail to thee Sunna!

    Gythia pours remainder of horn into the offering bowl.  Gythia and
    Gothi take the bowl and evergreen sprig and walk around the folk,
    sprinkling the mead to the four corners and on the folk.  Finally they
    return to the center and sprinkle the wheel.

    Gothi: Hail the sacred wheel of the sun.  Now it is the longest day of
    the year and the sun is triumphant, but all changes and the wheel
    turns.

    Gythia lights candles on the wheel and members of the folk take it up
    and parade it around the grounds.  A song or chant would be
    appropriate at this time.  .The sun burns, the wheel turns!. for
    example.  Once the procession is done (this decision should be based
    on the subjective feelings of those involved and not planned out) the
    wheel should be returned to the altar.

    Gothi & Gythia assume the invocation position

    Gothi: Sacred Lady Sunna, Summer Sun now strongest.  We thank you for
    your blessings of warmth and light.  May you reign long.

    All: Hail Sunna!  Hail Sunna!  Hail Sunna!

    Libation

    Gothi takes up the hlaut bowl.

    Gothi: Now our rite is ended and the sacrifice is made.  The wheel
    turns.  To Sunna, to the Gods, to the Goddesses, and to Earth, mother
    of us all, we offer this holy mead, from the Gods to the Earth To us.
    From ourselves to the Earth to the Gods.  Hail!

    2861

    Gothi pours contents of the hlaut bowl on the ground, possibly in the
    center of the wheel.  If this ritual is done indoors, the libation
    should be poured outside afterwards.  We usually trek outside
    immediately even if the ritual is an apartment.  The physical action
    of pouring the libation is an important psychological trigger to both
    Gods and men that the ritual is over.


    What Is The Raven Kindred?

    The Raven Kindred is a non-incorporated religious organization
    dedicated to the worship and veneration of the ancient Nordic Gods and
    Goddesses and to the religion of Asatru.  We are centered around the
    Worcester county area of Massachusetts and Southern Maryland/suburban
    D.C.  areas, but have members in Western Massachusetts, the Boston
    area, and Connecticut.  We welcome members from other areas, including
    contacts through correspondence.

    The focus of the Raven Kindred is specifically the religion of Asatru.
    While we honor our Pagan relations in the Wiccan community, we are
    following a much different tradition.  Our rituals are the blot or
    offering and the sumble.  Also while we are primarily involved as a
    kindred in exoteric forms of worship, we have members who are
    interested in seidhr, rune magic, and other esoteric pursuits within
    the Nordic Tradition.

    We practice a fairly conservative version of Asatru trying to keep
    close to our roots in the Asatru Free Assembly and Asatru Alliance
    including a tribalist sense of who we are as a Folk.  However, we are
    also much more progressive in our social beliefs and politics and we
    welcome all persons regardless of ethnic origin, sexual preference, or
    political view.  We hope to be a link between the Old and the New,
    holding to our dear values of Faith, Folk, and Family while discarding
    the prejudices that have held our religion back.

    Our goals for the future are quite far-reaching.  We support the
    movement to bring Asatru out of the shadows and to spread the Troth of
    the Gods to all who are their natural children.  More immediately we
    intend to network with existing Asatru organizations, both local and
    national, while also setting up other chapters of the Raven Kindred
    and doing some networking on our own behalf.

    Attendence at Raven Kindred rituals is essentially open, although we
    reserve the right to eject anyone who is disruptive as well as the
    right to hold observances that are open only to Professed Asatru or to
    Kindred Members.  Full membership is available only to those who have
    Professed Asatru and place their membership in the Raven Kindred above
    other religious commitments.  Decisions about the Raven Kindred are
    made by a majority vote by Full Members.

    Currently the Raven Kindred holds a Blot on the first Saturday of each
    month in Sturbridge Massachusetts and Wheaton Maryland.  We also
    gather at other seasonally appropriate times for Blots and other
    activities.

    Raven Kindred Ritual Outline

    The Raven Kindred has developed a slightly different form of the Blot
    ritual which we use.  This has come to pass because of a desire for
    more personal involvement as well as a smaller group of people than
    would be appropriate for a major blot.

    The major change, outside of a few cosmetic differences, is that we
    have added a .mini sumbel. to the blot ritual in place of the
    sprinkling in which we offer three rounds of toasts: the first
    dedicated to the God or Goddess being honored and the remaining two to
    anything the participants deem appropriate which is not inimical to
    the purpose of the blot.  (i.e.  don.t toast the Jotnar during a
    ritual to Thor.)

    Setting the mood: Chant to Odin, Vili, Ve

    To begin each ritual we offer a three round chant of .Odin, Vili, Ve..
    This serves two purposes.  First we are linking ourselves to the Gods
    of creation and thus to the connections between Midgard and the Gods.
    Second and perhaps more appropriately it allows people to get
    themselves mentally prepared for the service.

    Hammer Rite

    We offer an invocation to Fire and Ice which are the central elements
    of the creation of the world.  We ask that the place we are meeting be
    blessed and Holy for the coming of the Gods.

    Statement of purpose

    We far too often ignore this, but it.s a good idea to have the Gothi
    or Gythia who is presiding greet the participants and state something
    general about the purpose of the ritual.  It need not be complicated
    .We gather together today to celebrate the Winter Nights as our
    ancestors did.  To honor our ancestors, the Disir, and Freya the Great
    Dis and to renew our bonds as a family [kindred]..

    General Prayer

    At this point one of our members usually offers up a prayer to the
    Aesir and Vanir collectively to thank them for their bounty since the
    last time we met and to ask their blessings upon the kindred and its
    members.

    Personal invocations

    We reserve a time between the opening of the ritual and the blot
    ceremony for people to offer any prayers or other invocations they
    feel necessary.  This is the time when we Profess new members of
    Asatru.  Other activities done at this time have included a kindred
    member thanking Saga, the Goddess of wisdom, for her recent graduation
    2863

    from college.

    Invoke deity of occasion

    At this point we make a point to specifically invoke and honor the
    deity that we are bloting.  We attempt to list as many names and or
    functions of the God as possible and this serves a dual purpose in
    reminding the attendees of who the God is and why we are honoring Him.
    This is, however, separate from the offering.

    Meditation

    At this point we like to remind ourselves why we are here and what the
    Gods mean to us.  We sit and someone either offers a spoken meditation
    or more often reads a story from the mythology.  While most of us
    enjoy the poetic edda, we usually use a modern prose version of the
    myth as it is easier to follow.

    Offer/sanctify mead

    The Gothi takes up the horn and his assistant (often called .The
    Valkyrie. by Asafolk) fills it with mead.  The Gothi then steps to the
    altar and holds the horn aloft and asks the God to partake of it and
    charge it with his power.

    Toast to the deity of occasion

    This is when we begin to deviate substantially from the standard
    Asatru blot ritual.  Beginning with the Gothi the horn is raised and a
    toast drunk to the God.  The horn is then passed around to the Folk
    and a personal toast repeated.  The only rule here is that the round
    is dedicated to the God invoked.  Many times the toasts are personal
    thanksgiving or requests for aid or wisdom.

    At the end of the round the remains of the horn (and there should be
    some) are poured into the blotbowl.

    Remaining toasts

    We then take two more rounds to toast whatever Gods, ancestors, and
    beings each person wishes.  There is not necessarily any continuity
    from one person to the next.  Brags or oaths are also appropriate at
    this time.  Professions, other major oaths, and major works of
    thanksgiving or praise are usually done before the blot.  The second
    and third toasts are usually reserved for small things.

    Thank deity

    Finally we always remember to thank the deity and ask for his
    continued blessings on the Folk present.

    Oath Ring ceremony

    Our kindred has a ceremony that affirms our dedication to each other,
    to the kindred, and to the Gods.  Each full Professed and accepted
    Kindred member comes forward and takes hold of the oath ring.  (We are
    blessed in having a 6. diameter brass oath ring made for us by a
    kindred member.) One person then recites a rede concerning itself with
    2864

    the symbol of a ring and something which connects us to the Gods, the
    Earth, and to each other.

    I should repeat, only kindred Members participate in this.  If you
    haven.t sworn on the oath ring, you don.t take part in the ceremony.
    We have enlarged this at public events to all Professed persons, but
    change the rede to remove references to the kindred.

    Pour libation

    Finally we leave the Hof and pour a libation on the physical earth,
    adjourning outside to do so if we are indoors.  The blot hitting the
    ground signals that the ritual is truly over.  When we are working
    indoors in a living room or other non-dedicated space I always make
    sure I am the first to return and extinguish candles, turn on electric
    lights, etc.  This provides a good hint to people.s minds that the
    ritual is, in fact, over.  If we had a dedicated space, the procession
    outside to pour the blot would also empty the Hof and we would adjourn
    to the feast rather than returning to the temple.

    Sources and Resources for Asatru

    2867

    Please note: This resource list is provided as is and is intended to
    be comprehensive. The Raven Kindred doesn.t necessarily endorse any of
    the following organizations, publications, etc.

    Organizations:

    The Ring of Troth P.O. Box 25637; Tempe, AZ 85285-5637 The Ring of
    Troth was founded by Edred Thorsson. He resigned in Spring of 2242
    (Runic Reckoning . 1992 C.E.) and has been replaced by Prudence
    Priest, most well known as the editor of Yggdrasil.

    The Ring is governed by an appointed High Rede of 9 persons who guide
    the national affairs of the Ring. They offer a number of programs
    include an Elder training program for prospective clergy, The Rune
    Ring for study of the magical properties of the Runes from within a
    Germanic Pagan context, and recognition for local Kindreds.

    The Ring of Troth requires that .its members affiliate for cultural
    and religious reasons rather than for racial and political reasons.
    The use of the Ring of Troth as a platform for any type of political
    or racial propoganda will not be tolerated.

    The Troth provides a quarterly magazine and a networking list. There
    are also regional gatherings put on by individual Kindreds. Work is
    currently underway on a book of rituals.

    Dues are $24 and include a subscription to Idunna. If one does not
    wish to join, Friends of the Troth may receive Idunna for $24 as well.

    The Asatru Alliance of Independent Kindreds P.O. Box 961; Payson AZ
    85547

    The Alliance is the linear descendent of the Asatru Free Assembly.
    They are a democratically run national confederation of independent
    kindreds who meet once a year in an Allthing to conduct business. It
    is essentially conservative and libertarian. .The Alliance is based
    upon the ancient model of tribal democracy known as the Thing, and
    member kindreds support a code of laws we feel necessary to preserve
    and protect Asatru from those who would dilute, subvert, or in any way
    harm our religion. Membership in the Alliance is encouraged for those
    who actively promote and believe in the Aesir and Vanir and our
    collective Heathen Heritage. Anyone interested in joining the Alliance
    should contact the kindred of choice for acceptance. There is no
    membership in the Alliance except through a kindred. Applicants must
    subscribe to the membership requirements of the kindred of choice and
    uphold the bylaws of the Asatru Alliance.. This group has recently
    adopted a declaration stating that Asatru is an ethnic religion, so
    membership now seems to be limited on the basis of race.

    The Odinic Rite BM Edda; London, WCN 3XX

    The Odinic Rite BM Runic: London WCN 3XX

    These two organizations are each claiming to be the .true. Odinic
    Rite. The BM Runic address is the older one, but the BM Edda address
    seems to be producing more publications. I.d suggest writing to both
    and figuring it out on your own. The Odinic Rite is an organization
    for the revival of Odinism in England. If one sends a few postal reply
    2868

    coupons I believe each will send you information. Both publish
    magazines.
