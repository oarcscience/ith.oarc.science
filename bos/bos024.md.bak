# Yule in Britain

#### Copyright © 1987, Tana Culain

Midwinter has long been a traditional time for celebration and
merrymaking in Britain. All of the activities at midwinter were meant to
ensure that the season would renew itself and the days would begin to
grow longer again. Greenery was brought into decorate the house:
evergreen to symbolize the promise of life to come even in the darkest
winter; the mistletoe, believed to hold the life of the host tree even
when the tree itself appeared to be dead in winter; and the holly and
ivy, symbols of male and female, both of course necessary for new life.
Carols, some of which survive to this day, such as the Gower Wassail,
were sung. The earliest carols consisted of taking hands and singing
while dancing in a ring or around a bush, May tree, or even an apple
tree (as in the case of the Apple Tree Wassail, sung in hopes of a good
crop of cider the following year).

The Wassail Carols in particular date back to the Viking invasions of
England, about 700 A.D., when the greeting was "Ves heill". By
Anglo-Saxon times, the greeting had evolved into "Waes thu hal", meaning
"be whole" or "good health". The response was "drink hail", meaning "I
drink and good luck be to you". People would travel from house to house
in the village bringing good wishes and carrying an empty bowl. The
master of the house being wassailed was expected to fill the bowl with a
hot spicy ale and then it would be passed around to the carolers.

Midwinter was also a time for exchanging gifts and for feasting. Turkey
only dates to the 1500's. Much more common were boar, geese, capons,
swans, and pheasants. Minced pies were originally made with meat, and
with the coming of spices to England during the Crusades, plum pudding
became quite the traditional dish. Plum pudding makes a great dish for
cakes and wine in the Yule circle, especially if you pour warmed brandy
over it and set it afire before the blessing.

While I am writing about midwinter customs in Britain because our
heritage in .K.A.M. is largely Celtic in origin, the Isles do not have a
monopoly on Yule. The Romans celebrated Saturnalia for seven days around
the Solstice, and it was a time to look ahead and rejoice in the longer
days to come. Slaves and masters switched places at table, and presents
were exchanged. The Persian Mithraists held December 25th as sacred to
the birth of their Sun God, Mithras, and celebrated it as a victory of
light over darkness. And in Sweden, December 13th was sacred to the
Goddess Lucina, Shining One, and was a celebration of the return of the
light. On Yule itself, around the 21st, bonfires were lit to honor Odin
and Thor.

Midwinter has always been a Pagan holiday, so much so that during the
1600's the Christian Christmas was recognized as a celebration based on
Pagan customs and was outlawed in England and many of the colonies in
America.

    A Monthly Rune (Traditional) 

    January   By this fire I warm my hands 
    February  And with my spade I delve my lands 
    March     Here I set my seeds to spring 
    April     And here I hear the birds to sing 
    May       I am as light as bird in the treetop 
    June      And I take pains to weed my crop 
    July      With my scythe my mead I mow 
    August    And here I shear my corn full low 
    September With my flail I earn my bread 
    October   And here I sow my wheat so red (Winter wheat) 
    November  At Martinmas I kill my swine * 
    December  And at Yule I drink red wine 

\* Martinmas, November 11, is a christianization of the Pagan Celtic
Hallows when the herds were culled.

Recipe for Wassail for 8

3 red apples  
3 oz brown sugar  
2 pints brown ale, apple cider, or hard cider  
1/2 pint dry sherry or dry white wine  
1/4 tsp cinnamon  
1/4 teaspoon ginger  
strips of lemon peel

Core and heat apples with brown sugar and some of the ale or cider in an
oven for 30 minutes. Put in large pan and add rest of spices and lemon
peel, simmer on stove top of 5 minutes. Add most of the alcohol at the
last minute so it heats up but does not evaporate. Burgundy and brandy
can be substituted to the ale and sherry. White sugar and halved oranges
may also be added to taste.

Plum Pudding

1/4 lb. flour  
1/4 lb. currants  
1 tsp. salt  
1/4 lb. sultanas (small raisins)  
1 tsp. allspice  
2 cooking apples, peeled, cored and chopped  
1 tsp. ginger  
1 ounce cut mixed (citrus) peel  
1 tsp. cinnamon  
2 oz. shredded almonds  
pinch fresh grated nutmeg  
Juice and grated rind of 1 orange and 1 lemon  
1/4 lb. fresh breadcrumbs  
1/4 lb. molasses (treacle)  
1/2 lb. shredded suet  
4 large eggs  
1/4 lb. brown sugar  
2 tbsp. brandy  
1/4 lb. dried chopped apricots  
1/4 lb. prunes  
1/4 lb dates

Sift flour, salt and spices into a large bowl. Stir in breadcrumbs, suet
and sugar. Add fruits, peel and rind. Beat lemon and orange juice,
molasses and eggs together and add to other ingredients. Steam for 6
hours -- a coffee tin filled with the mixture and placed in a steamer in
a covered pan does well. A little vinegar and lemon juice in the water
will prevent the pan from discoloration. After steaming cover in a cool
place and let age as long as possible -- usually about 5 weeks. To
serve, re-steam for another 3 hours. Remove from tin, douse with warm
brandy and set it ablaze!

If you haven't got six weeks before Yule to prepare a proper pudding (I
never do) a tinned one from Crosse & Blackwell will do fine. Just be
sure to always heat the pudding first, no matter who made it, or all the
warmed brandy in the world won't help. And don't forget the hard sauce!
