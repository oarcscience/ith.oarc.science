# Harvest Home

#### by Mike Nichols

There were three men came out of the West,

Despite the bad publicity generated by Thomas Tryon's novel, Harvest
Home is the pleasantest of holidays. Admittedly, it does involve the
concept of sacrifice, but one that is symbolic only. The sacrifice is
that of the spirit of vegetation, John Barleycorn. Occurring 1/4 of the
year after Midsummer, Harvest Home represents mid-autumn, autumn's
height. It is also the Autumnal Equinox, one of the quarter days of the
year, a Lesser Sabbat and a Low Holiday in modern Witchcraft.
Technically, an equinox is an astronomical point and, due to the fact
that the Earth wobbles on its axis slightly (rather like a top that's
slowing down), the date may vary by a few days depending on the year.
The autumnal equinox occurs when the sun crosses the equator on its
apparent journey southward, and we experience a day and a night that are
of equal duration. Up until Harvest Home, the hours of daylight have
been greater than the hours from dusk to dawn. But from now on, the
reverse holds true. Astrologers know this as the date on which the sun
enters the sign of Libra, the Balance (an appropriate symbol of a
balanced day and night). This year (1988) it will occur at 2:29 pm CDT
on September 22nd.

However, since most European peasants were not accomplished at
calculating the exact date of the Equinox, they celebrated the event on
a fixed calendar date, September 25th, a holiday the Medieval Church
Christianized under the name of 'Michaelmas', the feast of the Archangel
Michael. (One wonders if, at some point, the R.C. Church contemplated
assigning the four quarter days of the year to the four Archangels, just
as they assigned the four cross-quarter days to the four gospel-writers.
Further evidence for this may be seen in the fact that there was a brief
flirtation with calling the Vernal Equinox 'Gabrielmas', ostensibly to
commemorate the angel Gabriel's announcement to Mary on Lady Day.)
Again, it must be remembered that the Celts reckoned their days from
sundown to sundown, so the September 25th festivities actually begin on
the previous sundown (our September 24th).

Although our Pagan ancestors probably celebrated Harvest Home on
September 25th, modern Witches and Pagans, with their desk-top computers
for making finer calculations, seem to prefer the actual equinox point,
beginning the celebration on its eve (this year, sunset on September
21st).

Mythically, this is the day of the year when the god of light is
defeated by his twin and alter-ego, the god of darkness. It is the time
of the year when night conquers day. And as I have recently shown in my
seasonal reconstruction of the Welsh myth of Blodeuwedd, the Autumnal
Equinox is the only day of the whole year when Llew (light) is
vulnerable and it is possible to defeat him. Llew now stands on the
balance (Libra/autumnal equinox), with one foot on the cauldron
(Cancer/summer solstice) and his other foot on the goat
(Capricorn/winter solstice). Thus he is betrayed by Blodeuwedd, the
Virgin (Virgo) and transformed into an Eagle (Scorpio).

Two things are now likely to occur mythically, in rapid succession.
Having defeated Llew, Goronwy (darkness) now takes over Llew's
functions, both as lover to Blodeuwedd, the Goddess, and as King of our
own world. Although Goronwy, the Horned King, now sits on Llew's throne
and begins his rule immediately, his formal coronation will not be for
another six weeks, occurring at Samhain (Halloween) or the beginning of
Winter, when he becomes the Winter Lord, the Dark King, Lord of Misrule.
Goronwy's other function has more immediate results, however. He mates
with the virgin goddess, and Blodeuwedd conceives, and will give birth
-- nine months later (at the Summer Solstice) -- to Goronwy's son, who
is really another incarnation of himself, the Dark Child.

Llew's sacrificial death at Harvest Home also identifies him with John
Barleycorn, spirit of the fields. Thus, Llew represents not only the
sun's power, but also the sun's life trapped and crystallized in the
corn.

Often this corn spirit was believed to reside most especially in the
last sheaf or shock harvested, which was dressed in fine clothes, or
woven into a wicker-like man-shaped form. This effigy was then cut and
carried from the field, and usually burned, amidst much rejoicing. So
one may see Blodeuwedd and Goronwy in a new guise, not as conspirators
who murder their king, but as kindly farmers who harvest the crop which
they had planted and so lovingly cared for. And yet, anyone who knows
the old ballad of John Barleycorn knows that we have not heard the last
of him.

They let him stand till midsummer's day,

Incidentally, this annual mock sacrifice of a large wicker-work figure
(representing the vegetation spirit) may have been the origin of the
misconception that Druids made human sacrifices. This charge was first
made by Julius Caesar (who may not have had the most unbiased of
motives), and has been re-stated many times since. However, as has often
been pointed out, the only historians besides Caesar who make this
accusation are those who have read Caesar. And in fact, upon reading
Caesar's 'Gallic Wars' closely, one discovers that Caesar never claims
to have actually witnessed such a sacrifice. Nor does he claim to have
talked to anyone else who did. In fact, there is not one single
eyewitness account of a human sacrifice performed by Druids in all of
history!

Nor is there any archeological evidence to support the charge. If, for
example, human sacrifices had been performed at the same ritual sites
year after year, there would be physical traces. Yet there is not a
scrap. Nor is there any native tradition or history which lends support.
In fact, insular tradition seems to point in the opposite direction. The
Druid's reverence for life was so strict that they refused to lift a
sword to defend themselves when massacred by Roman soldiers on the Isle
of Mona. Irish Brehon laws forbade a Druid to touch a weapon, and any
soul rash enough to unsheathe a sword in the presence of a Druid would
be executed for such an outrage! Jesse Weston, in her brilliant study of
the Four Hallows of British myth, 'From Ritual to Romance', points out
that British folk tradition is, however, full of *mock* sacrifices. In
the case of the wicker-man, such figures were referred to in very
personified terms, dressed in clothes, addressed by name, etc. In such a
religious ritual drama, everybody played along.

They've hired men with scythes so sharp,

In the medieval miracle-play tradition of the 'Rise Up, Jock' variety
(performed by troupes of mummers at all the village fairs), a young
harlequin-like king always underwent a mock sacrificial death. But
invariably, the traditional cast of characters included a mysterious
'Doctor' who had learned many secrets while 'travelling in foreign
lands'. The Doctor reaches into his bag of tricks, plies some magical
cure, and presto! the young king rises up hale and whole again, to the
cheers of the crowd. As Weston so sensibly points out, if the young king
were *actually* killed, he couldn't very well rise up again, which is
the whole point of the ritual drama! It is an enactment of the death and
resurrection of the vegetation spirit. And what better time to perform
it than at the end of the harvest season?

In the rhythm of the year, Harvest Home marks a time of rest after hard
work. The crops are gathered in, and winter is still a month and a half
away! Although the nights are getting cooler, the days are still warm,
and there is something magical in the sunlight, for it seems silvery and
indirect. As we pursue our gentle hobbies of making corn dollies (those
tiny vegetation spirits) and wheat weaving, our attention is suddenly
arrested by the sound of baying from the skies (the 'Hounds of Annwn'
passing?), as lines of geese cut silhouettes across a harvest moon. And
we move closer to the hearth, the longer evening hours giving us time to
catch up on our reading, munching on popcorn balls and caramel apples
and sipping home-brewed mead or ale. What a wonderful time Harvest Home
is! And how lucky we are to live in a part of the country where the
season's changes are so dramatic and majestic!

And little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl --
