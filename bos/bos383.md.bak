                                                 THE CLOUD SCULPTORS 
                                                 Staeorra Rokraven 
                      - 
                   The air finds flight in forms of lofty wind 
                   As one with nature's children taking part 
                   And soaring up to go and find a friend 
                   Then join with water spinning wispy art. 
                      - 
                   This nature's process has eternal known 
                   The way to hang up on the sky these drapes 
                   But wonder not how these soft clouds have grown 
                   From fleecy strand filled webs to take their shapes? 
                      - 
                   Perhaps the artist's brush a thing unseen 
                   With living tools the Elder Gods express 
                   Those firey ones whose scales and talons gleam 
                   To grace the heavens with their soft caress. 
                      - 
                     Now see the strokes of carving wings along 
                     With falling rain - the strains of Dragon song. 

                                                                                               1868
