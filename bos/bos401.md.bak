                                      WHEN SATURN RULED AQUARIUS 
                        
                       The Kiss of Saturn is hot, black, fierce, deep 
                       A hint of Wild Ass 
                       In her blue-black hair 
                       Breasts soft as black Lead 
                        
                       Moulten hips steaming with empowerment 
                       Belly bold with Lust 
                       That heals...and heals...and heals 
                       Uranus!  She cries. 
                        
                       "Wild Ass!" I reply. "I am set on you!" 
                       My Wild Ass prances 
                       "For I am Set, my Nepthys 
                       My sweet Wild Ass 
                        
                       I come to claim your dark powers tonight 
                       In Binah tonight 
                       For we are in Binah 
                       Deep set in Binah 
                        
                       Saturn am I!  Shivah am I! I AM! 
                       I am Atman!  THAT! 
                       I claim you Dark Nepthys 
                       THAT we may be ONE!" 
                        
                       In Atman hide the Secrets of Maya 
                       Terrible Maya 
                       (When we are in Her Claws) 
                       Is kind in Atman 
                        
                       There is a reversal in Atman 
                       Of subtle beauty 
                       Maya becomes God's Will 
                       And I am as God 
                        
                       In Atman.  I am as God, Will Supreme 
                       Soft as a Feather 
                       Strong, gentle, wise and firm, 
                       Free!  I am Atman! 
                        
                       I am Atman.  I am Free.  I am He. 
                       In Atman, I AM 
                       As God in Atman. 
                       Free!  I am Atman! 
                       



                                                                                               1886
