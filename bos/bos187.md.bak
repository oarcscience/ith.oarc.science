                   Apostolic succession from "that time whereof the memory of man 
                   runneth not to the contrary", or was our religion dreamed up in

                   continued with somewhat less fervor today than it was in the

                 early teachers tried to justify their credentials by claiming 
                   that what they taught had great antiquity.  The question isn't 
                   any easier to answer with truth or objectivity when there is a 
                             bunch
                                 ofradicalfundamentalistsrunningaroundseekingtoclaim
                 that we aren't really a religion and so of course we aren't 
                   entitled to protection under the First Amendment. 
          
                        It is a sign of progress, I think, that there seems to be 
                   less of that sort of teaching today than there was when I began 
                   my studies.  Today most of the teachers that I know are secure 
                   enough in their religion that they can face the staggering 
                   thought that the ethical and philosophical system that guides 
                   their lives may indeed be younger than some of them are.  The 
                   plain fact is that we simply don't know.

                  the lack of such a document as by a possible desire to suppress 
                   it.  We may never know that one, but when push comes to shove, 
                   does it really matter?

                  Jefferson a bit and remark that the modern practitioners of 
                   Witchcraft are undeniably here and a large number of them are 
                             sincere intheirbeliefs. Thatinitselfshouldqualify usasa
                 religion. 
          
                        Perhaps as important as the legal question is our own self 
                   image.  Would a "real witch" from the middle ages recognize or 
                             disownone ofhersisters oftoday? Wouldshewant togowith a
                 "New Age" circle, a Dianic grove, a Gardnerian coven, or would 
                   she laugh hysterically at the bunch of us and walk off into the 
                   sunset? 
          
                        While the antiquity of our current practice of witchcraft 
                   shouldn't be a matter of serious concern, to us _or to our 
                             detractors,itsauthenticityshouldbe.Thesearchforourroots
                  must continue to be pursued by serious scholars and magicians 
                   alike in order that we may come as close as possible to the 
                             ideals andpurposesofourancientpredecessors.Thereisavery
                 practical reason why this is so.  That reason is tied up in 
                             somethingcalledan_egregore. Onthesubjectofan egregore,I
                 would like to quote extensively from a recent article in _Gnosis 
                   by Gaetan Delaforge: 
          
                   ..."An egregore is a kind of group mind which is created when 
                             peopleconsciouslycometogetherforacommonpurpose.Whenever
                 people gather together to do something and egregore is formed, 
                             butunlessanattemptismadetomaintain itdeliberatelyitwill
                           dissipaterather quickly.Howeverifthe peoplewishtomaintain
                 it and know the techniques of how to do so, the egregore will 
                   continue to grow in strength and can last for centuries.   
          
                   An egregore has the characteristic of having an effectiveness 
                   greater than the mere sum of its individual members.  It 
                   continuously interacts with its members, influencing them and 
                   being influenced by them.  The interaction works positively by 
                   stimulating and assisting its members but only as long as they 
                             behaveand actinlinewith itsoriginalaim.It willstimulate
                 both individually and collectively all those faculties in the 
                             groupwhichwillpermittherealizationoftheobjectivesof its
                 original program.  If this process is continued a long time the 
                   egregore will take on a kind of life of its own, and can become 
                   so strong that even if all its members should die, it would 
                   continue to exist on the inner dimensions and can be contacted 
                   even centuries later by a group of people prepared to live the 
                             livesoftheoriginalfounders,particularlyiftheyarewilling
                 to provide the initial input of energy to get it going again. 


                                                                                 789

          
                   If the egregore is concerned with spiritual or esoteric 
                   activities its influence will be even greater.  People who 
                             discoverthekeyscantapinonapowerfulegregorerepresenting,
                  for example, a spiritual or esoteric tradition, will, if they 
                   follow the line described above by activating and maintaining

              a clear conscience, claim to be an authentic order of the 
                   tradition represented by that egregore.  In my view this is the 
                   only yardstick by which a genuine Templar order should be 
                   measured."*3*

                        In her books "The Sea Priestess" and "Moon Magic", Dion 
                   Fortune was demonstrating this technique.  Vivien LeFay Morgan

                  of the Atlantean priesthood. 
          
                        When Gerald Gardner published "Witchcraft Today", he 
                   embarked upon the outward steps of his part of the reactivation 
                   of the egregore of the old witch cult in western Europe.  The 
                   inward steps were probably begun by one or more of the magical 
                             lodgesof

                  force in the world.  How well it has achieved this end is to be 
                   observed by anyone with the eyes to see.   
          
          
                        I personally think that our job in this generation is to 
                   deepen and strengthen our ties with this newly reawakened force 
                   in the world; to learn from it and to draw inspiration from it, 
                   and to bring the Craft back from the status of a "cult" to that 
                   of a genuine religion.  To do this we must learn more of the 
                             goals,ideals,andambitionsofourbrothersandsisterswhohave
                  gone before--as they really were, not as we would like them to 
                   have been.

                   Craft.  The idea, when activating and interacting with an 
                   egregore is to re-create the _goals and _attitudes of the 
                   founders.  That doesn't freeze the practitioner into practices 
                   which have long since been outgrown.

                                                                             Whatdid
                           Samhainreallymean toourpredecessors;or Beltane;orImbolc? 
                       Not only howdid theycelebrate it,but how didthey _feelabout  
                   it? Platitudes about"fruitfulness and fertility"are simplytoo    
                 superficial. This is not madeany easier by the factthat these      
           observances were pastoral and agricultural while most of us are 
                   city dwellers who do well to keep a potted plant alive through 
                   one summer. 
          
                        An attempt in this direction was made by the Holy Order of 
                             SaintBrigitnearFortMorgan,Coloradoabout tenyearsago.The
                  farm is gone now and its residents are scattered, yet it cannot 
                   be said to have entirely failed of its purpose.  Many of the 
                   former participants in the experiments can be found today, 
                   quietly practicing the Craft. 
          
                   This is not to say that we all should sell our goods, quit our 
                   jobs, and move out into communes somewhere, but we must at the 
                             leastestablishcloseenoughcontactwiththeharshrealitiesof
                 this world that we can appreciate how frightening the onset of 
                   winter must have been to those who had no central heating, food

                         will,perhaps,be ableto recapturethemindset ofthePriestess  
               at Samhain. 
          
          
                        These truths are not to be found in the Fantasy fiction
