                           Ghosts of Christmas Past 
                                 by Eric Maple

    Every December 25th the normally phlegmatic British let down their hair
    and plunge into an orgy of fun which one would normally associate  with 
    the  people  of more exuberant nations.

        Complete strangers wish one another a Happy Christmas as a parting
    greeting and the public houses are filled with revellers strenuously
    keeping up the spirit of the season of goodwill.

        Few of these light-hearted souls will be aware that the celebration
    of Christmas had its origins in the pagan worship of the Sun or, for
    that matter, that the funny hats, the evergreens and the festive board
    have nothing whatsoever to do with Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace,
    but rather with the older gods worshipped by our ancestors in the
    twilight world of pre-Christmas Europe.

        It is strange to consider that the presence of pork on the Christmas
    table and the custom of carrying in the boar's head was once associated
    with the sacrifice of a sacred Boar to the Sun god. At the festival of
    Frey, the dispenser of  rain  and  sunshine  in  the mythology of
    Northern Europe, a boar was a good luck offering for the New Year and
    its head, with an apple in its mouth, was borne into the banqueting-hall
    amid singing and the sound of welcoming  trumpets.  Later in history,
    the boar's head gave way to the goose and the turkey. But where this
    custom survives, it should be seen as one of the many curious ghosts of
    Christmas past.

        Consider the evergreens and their modern counterparts: the paper-
    -chains which festoon the house  at  Christmastide.  The evergreen was
    once the symbol of immortality, declared sacred to the Teutonic nations,
    and given pride of place in celebrations associated with the Winter Sol-
    stice from which our modern Christmas is descended.

        As a symbol, the evergreen means constancy and eternity, and even in
    the Orient we find that it expresses a similar idea, for the Japanese
    believe the evergreen needle brings longevity and prosperity. The holly,
    especially, brings happiness and friendship, but if kept in the house
    after New Year's Day misfortune is ordained.   Generally speaking,
    however, all evergreens must be taken down by Twelfth Night-- then all
    will be well.

        When we look around the room that has been decked with the regalia
    of the Christmas party our eyes inevitably settle on one of the focal
    points, the mistletoe.  In pagan times, it was customary to celebrate
    the death of the old year and the birth of the new by kissing under the
    mistletoe's berries.  Old enemies were then expected to forget their
    quarrels and take a ceremonial kiss, promising to live in amity from
    that time forth.

        It is not generally known that the mistletoe became a powerful
    life symbol because it grew' berries in winter when other plant life
    seemed dead. Once known as All Heal,  it was employed as an ingredient
    in many folk medicines.  It was the golden bough of the ancient Druids
    and, because of its  association  with  sacrificial ceremonies, was
    outlawed by the Church as an emblem of paganism.

    2550

        Oddly enough, the sole exception was York Minster where a sprig  of 
    mistletoe was  placed on the altar each Christmas. A general pardon for
    crimes remained in force throughout that city for as long as it remained
    there.

        The  central  symbol  of  the Christmas scene, the evergreen
    Christmas tree, had its origins in Germany where St Boniface cut
    down a sacred oak which was worshipped by the pagans and, to placate
    them, offered a fir tree in  its  place.  However, later research
    indicates that traces of a similar custom existed in other lands,
    notably Greece and Rome, where trees were decorated at the time of year
    later dedicated to Christmas. There is also reason for believing that
    the same or a similar custom  was  known  in ancient Egypt.

        The mystical heritage of Christmas is very strongly represented in
    one of the principal characters in the celebrations, Santa Claus, the
    embodiment of the spirit of goodwill. The name Santa Claus is in fact a
    corruption of the fifth century St Nicholas, the Bishop of Myra, who was
    honoured with special ceremonies by the Greeks and Romans on December
    6th, later changed to December 25th.

        This distinctly un- ghostlike genus of happiness was a 'reincar-
    nation' of Odin, God of the Scandinavians who, on the conversion of
    Northern Europe to Christianity, was transformed first into St Nicholas
    and later into the modern Father Christmas.

        Christmas has no equal as a religious feast; it is the most
    important as well as the most enjoyable festival of the entire year. Yet
    even the good things spread out on the table have their religious
    aspects, particularly the mince-pies which were originally fashioned in
    the shape of small cribs in honour of the Christ Child.

        Among the superstitions associated with mince-pies is one which
    demands that the Christmas reveller makes a pilgrimage among his  
    neighbours   and   friends demanding the gift of a mince-pie wherever he
    calls. For each one eaten, so goes the tradition, the visitor may expect
    a month's good health for the ensuing year.

        Originally, mince-pies contained a far more potent filling than
    mere mincemeat. They were stuffed with flesh of game hashed together
    with pickled mushrooms.  One should always make a wish when taking the
    first bite of the first mince-pie of the season.

        The Christmas pudding qualifies as a magical ritual in its own
    own right, for it is surrounded by the  most  curious  ceremonies.
    Prior to the 18th century the pudding was known as Plum Porage and was
    a concoction of plums, spices, wines, meat broth and breadcrumbs. It was
    eaten in a semi-liquid state and only later in its history were the
    plums replaced by raisins.

        To preserve good luck, the pudding should be stirred deasil or
    clockwise: a ceremony known to most psychic cooks. Lucky charms and
    silver coins have to be incorporated in the mix to bring good fortune to
    the eater, usually a silver coin, a silver thimble and a ring, with the
    following meanings:  the silver coin brings good luck; the ring promises
    a happy marriage to the girl who finds it; while the thimble hints that
    she is likely to remain a spinster.

    2551

        The most interesting feature of Christmas pudding lore is the custom
    of setting fire to the brandy, so that the pudding can be brought to the
    table all aflame. This is a curious reminder that in ancient times
    special fires were lit  at the midwinter  feast  to honour the Sun god.

        One ghost which  has  been finally exorcised from the Christmas
    scene is the Dumb Cake which in times past was prepared by single girls
    for consumption on Christmas Eve. Its ingredients were salt, wheatmeal
    and barley, and it had to be baked in complete silence.  It was
    carefully placed in the oven and the front door opened  precisely  at 
    midnight.  The spectre of the girl's future husband was expected to
    enter the house at that time and march into the kitchen to turn the
    cake.  In some areas the cook would prick her initials on the cake and
    in due course her future husband would  materialise  to  add  his
    initials to hers. Alas, this custom seems to have vanished for ever.

        The modern Christmas cake is still with us. It is supposed to have
    originated with a cake presented by the people of ancient Rome to their
    senators. A custom among Scots demanded that the cook should rise in the
    early hours of Christmas Day and bake sowen  (oatmeal)  cakes.  These
    were distributed to the family at Hogmanay. If a cake happened to
    break, bad luck followed, but if it remained unbroken the eater
    could look forward to a Happy New Year.

        Although there is no clear-cut tradition that Christmas Day was ever
    associated with the giving of presents prior to modern times, it is
    known that a similar custom was observed by the Romans on New Year's
    Day. The Roman gift would have been a goodwill symbol only, consisting
    of branches of evergreen, but in time the presents became more lavish.

        Many of the enjoyable rituals which involve our lives at Christmas
    time are but the shadow survivals or 'ghosts' of very ancient customs
    performed around the close of the old year and the birth of the new, and
    the feast of fire celebrated at the time of the Winter Solstice to
    honour the Sun god.

        But the season of fire and light, as it is sometimes called, would
    be nothing without the Yule-log,for Christmas is also known as Yule,
    which was the Scandinavian feast of the Winter Solstice.

        In the days of old, an oak log was cut down on Yule Eve, and borne
    with much ceremony into the house and rolled onto the huge fire that was
    to burn during the days of the Nativity, especially Christmas Day.
    Little did the pious Christians of the medieval world realise that
    originally it had been burned in honour of the god Thor and represented
    the sacred element: fire.

        No doubt it was due to this association with the old gods that the 
    hearth  fire  at  Christmas assumed the important role which it retained
    until the advent of artificial forms of heating. The hearth was the
    centre for the telling of Christmas ghost stories and for those curious
    superstitions relating to the mysteries of fire.

        Throughout Northern Europe there were traditions that the family
    ghosts returned at Christmas time to share the festival with their
    living relatives. In Brittany there was the custom of leaving food for
    the ghosts while the family attended church. In Scandinavia, stories
    were told of trolls (who  were ogres  not  ghosts) returning at this

    season to rattle the window-panes. In the British Isles  there  were 
    contradictory beliefs, some people thought, erroneously, that no ghost
    had power to haunt during the Christmas season.

        It is when the light is extinguished save for the glowing embers
    that the ghost-story teller comes into his own and, surrounded by the
    family, describes some ancient haunting which is calculated to chill the
    blood of his listeners.  Traditional  hauntings include the posthumous
    adventures of Anne Boleyn who haunts her old homes during the Christmas
    season. Her ghost has been reported at Rochford Hall in Essex and Hever
    Castle in Kent, wandering headless during the 12 days of the festival.

        There are a number of cheerless proverbs which surface at the season
    of goodwill, as when someone  observes, 'A green Christmas brings a full
    church-yard,' possibly to counteract any excessive exuberance among the
    party.

        However, the children turn to less ghostly rituals, including
    divination to discover the future.  Each of them cuts an apple and
    counts the pips. The one whose apple has the most pips can look forward
    to the most happiness in the 12 months ahead.

        And so young and old join in quiet communion with Christmas-
    es  past,  present  and  future, united in quaint ceremonies whose
    origins are lost in history - a celebration presided over by ancestral
    spirits who have been lured into the home from outer darkness by the
    glow of the pagan fire.
