                                --------------- 
             The following is excerpted  from  an article, Making  Magic For
     Planet Earth, written  by Selena Fox for Circle  Network News (Box 219,
     Mt. Horeb, WI 53572 ) and presented here as being of public interest to
     the pagan  community at large. Selena,  I didn't have time  to ask your
     permission, I presume that by the very nature of your writings you want
     them  to be  shared with as  many people  as possible, and  so they are
     presented here. This  is submitted with  this statement and  not to  be
     edited, by Shadowstar of Boston MA. 
      
           &quot;There are many things thatcan be done in spiritual realmsto help
     bring about solutions to the world's problems: 
      
           * We can kindle spiritualfriendships with other lifeforms through
     communication  with  Nature Spirits,  who can  be  teachers for  us and
     allies in bringing about planetary healing. 
      
           * We can do daily meditations in whichwe creatively visualize the
     spiritual body of the planet glowing with radiant healing light. 
      
           * We can organize and/or take part in ecumenical planetary prayer
     services and  rituals with practitioners  of other spiritual  paths and
     cultures. 
      
           * We canhonor Mother Earth as an aspect of the divine in our solo
     and group rituals. 
      
           * We can send Mother Earth our love and pray for planetary health
     each time  we  visit a  stone  circle, sacred  grove, place  of  power,
     temple, shrine or other sacred site. 
      
        * We can do spiritual healing magic for the planet in our circles. 
      
           It is important to  reinforce whatever spiritual work we  do with
     physical action.  There are a variety of ways to do this and you should
     decide on at least one approach and then carry  it out.  Here are a few
     examples: 
      
           * Recycle trash from your household, take paper, plastics, glass,
     aluminum cans, and other recyclables to recycling centers. 
      
           *Recycle clothes and no longer needed household items by donating
     them to charities to distribute to the needy. 
      
        * Join and actively participate in environmental action groups. 
      
           * Write government officialsand urge them to takespecific actions
     on specific environmental issues, such as stopping all ocean dumping. 
      
           *  Write letters and articles for publications about the need for
     environmental preservation. 
      
        * Plant trees as part of reforestation efforts. 
      
        * Compost food scraps. 
         
        * Stop buying and using non-bio-degradable detergents. 
                                                                         615

        
           * Boycott products from companies  that are destroying the Amazon
     rainforest. 
      
           * Pick up cigarette butts and other non-biodegradable litter from
     parks and other wilderness areas. 
      
        * Donate money to nature preserves. 
      
           * Give talks atschools, civic groups, churches andin other places
     in your area about ecological issues. 
      
           * Read publications, view films, and attend presentations inorder
     to  keep informed  about  ecological  conditions  and  to  learn  about
     additional ways you can work for planetary healing. 
      
        * Conserve electricity, water and other resources on a daily basis. 
        * Network with others. 
                                                                         616
