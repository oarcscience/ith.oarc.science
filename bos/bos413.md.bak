                                             PANDEMONIUM 
                 
                Hi, ho, it's Spring again, 
                 
                Out of my eye's corner 
                 
                I thought I saw the Horned Man, the Green Man 
                 
                Charging down the glen, 
                 
                 
                It was not Pan, 
                 
                I did not get that freezing in the bone, 
                 
                Half fear, half ecstacy. 
                 
                Perhaps I was mistook, 
                 
                And only wished I saw, 
                 
                 
                And maybe Pan is playing in a rock band, 
                 
                Traveling in a wave of liquorous riot, 
                 
                George 'something' and the Destroyers 
                 
                           Sonia Brock

                                                                                               1898
