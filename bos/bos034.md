# Technology and The Craft

## Removing the Barriers to Spaceflight

Before the ritual begins, distribute paper and have an airplane-folding
session.

## Techno-lesson \#1: Making Fire

He tries to light the fire with firesticks; She then enters, lights the
charcoal with the sacred Bic, and hands it to He, who lights the quarter
candles with it and hands it back to She, who lights the altar candles.

### Bless the Elements (She)

### Cast the Circle (He)

### Invoke Quarters (She)

**All breathe, ground and center**

## Techno-lesson \#2: Overcoming Physical Shortcomings

Chant: She Changes Everything She Touches

He & She begin the chant, She drumming. Her shoulder starts acting up;
He gets out the Casio (tempo -2, any 4/4 rhythm). For the chant, mix
verses as is pleasing.

Techno-lesson \#3: Supplementing Abilities

First, He & She 'argue' about who's going to lead it, jokingly asking if
anyone in Circle wants to do background music; then He gets pathworking
with music on audio tape. When pathworking is done, folks should still
be in light trance; the next thing is to concretize the working by
distributing pens so that people can put whatever they symbols they
think are appropriate on their airplanes.

**Power chant:** A rising OM; which at peak leads into Countdown. At
"Liftoff", throw the planes upwards (when done, planes can either be
kept or HP/S should offer to see that they get burned.

**(\* Note \*) (\* Note \*) Don't forget to Ground (\* Note \*) (\* Note
\*)**

**Grounding chant:**

Earth below us  
Drifting, falling  
Floating weightless  
Coming home.
