# Beltane: Its History and Modern Celebration in Wicca in America

#### by Rowan Moonstone

The celebration of May 1st, or Beltane as it is known in Wicca Circles,
is one of the most important festivals of our religious year. I will
attempt here to answer some of the most often asked questions about this
holiday. An extensive bibliography follows the article so that the
interested reader can do further research.

1.  Where does the festival of Beltane originate?

    Beltane, as practiced by modern day Witches and Pagans, has its
    origins among the Celtic peoples of Western Europe and the British
    Isles, particularly Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

2.  What does the word Beltane mean?

    Dr. Proinsias MacCana defines the word as follows: "... the Irish
    name for May Day is Beltane, of which the second element, 'tene', is
    the word for fire, and the first, 'bel', probably means 'shining or
    brilliant'."<sup>1</sup> The festival was known by other names in
    other Celtic countries. Beltaine in Ireland, Bealtunn in Scotland,
    Shenn do Boaldyn on the Isle of Mann and Galan Mae in
    Wales.<sup>2</sup>

3.  What was the significance of this holiday to the ancients?

    To the ancient Celts, it symbolized the coming of spring. It was the
    time of year when the crops began to sprout, the animals bore their
    young and the people could begin to get out of the houses where they
    had been cooped up during the long dark cold winter months. Keep in
    mind that the people in those days had no electric lights or heat
    and that the Celtic countries are at a much more northerly latitude
    than many of us are used to. At that latitude, spring comes much
    later and winter lasts much longer than in most of the US. The
    coming of fair weather and longer daylight hours would be most
    welcome after a long cold and dark winter.

4.  How did the ancient Celts celebrate this festival?

    The most ancient way of observing this day is with fire. Beltane,
    along with Samhain (Nov. 1), Imbolc (Feb. 1), and Lughnassadh (Aug.
    1), was one of the four great "fire festivals" which marked the
    turning points of the Celtic year. The most ancient records tell us
    that the people would extinguish all the hearth fires in the country
    and then relight them from the "need fires" lit by the druids (who
    used friction as a means of ignition). In many areas, the cattle
    were driven between two great bonfires to protect them from disease
    during the coming year. It is my personal belief, although I have no
    documentation to back up the assumption, that certain herbs would
    have been burnt in the fires, thus producing smoke which would help
    destroy parasites which might make cattle and other livestock ill.

5.  In what other ways was this festival celebrated?

    One of the most beautiful customs associated with this festival was
    "bringing in the May." The young people of the villages and towns
    would go out into the fields and forests at Midnight on April 30th
    and gather flowers with which to bedeck themselves, their families
    and their homes. They would process back into the villages, stopping
    at each home to leave flowers and to receive the best of food and
    drink that the home had to offer. This custom is somewhat similar to
    "trick or treat" at Samhain and was very significant to the
    ancients. John Williamson, in his study "The Oak King, the Holly
    King and the Unicorn" writes: "These revelers were messengers of the
    renewal of vegetation, and they assumed the right to punish the
    niggardly, because avarice (as opposed to generosity) was dangerous
    to the community's hope for the abundance of nature. At an important
    time like the coming of summer, food, the substance of life, must be
    ritually circulated generously within the community in order that
    the cosmic circuit of life's substance may be kept in motion (trees,
    flocks, harvests, etc.)."<sup>3</sup> These revelers would bless the
    fields and flocks of those who were generous and wish ill harvests
    on those who withheld their bounty.

6.  What about maypoles?

    The maypole was an adjunct to the festival of bringing in the May.
    It is a phallic symbol, and as such represented fertility to the
    participants in the festival. In olden days, the revelers who went
    into the woods would cut a tree and bring it into town, decking it
    with flowers and greenery and dance around it clockwise (also called
    deosil, meaning "sun-wise", the direction of the sun's apparent
    travel across the face of the Earth) to bring fertility and good
    luck. The ribbons which we associate with the maypole today were a
    later addition.

7.  Why was fertility important?

    The people who originated this custom lived in close connection with
    the land. If the flocks and fields were fertile, they were ableto
    eat; if there was famine or drought, they went hungry. It is hard
    for us today to relate to this concept, but to the ancients, it was
    literally a life and death matter. The Celts were a very close
    tribal people, and fertility of their women literally meant
    continuity of the tribe.

8.  How is the maypole connected with fertility?

    Many scholars see the maypole as a phallic symbol. In this aspect,
    it is a very powerful symbol of the fertility of nature and spring.

9.  How did these ancient customs come down to us?

    When Christianity came to the British Isles, many of the ancient
    holy sites were taken over by the new religion and converted to
    Christian sites. Many of the old Gods and Goddesses became Christian
    saints, and many of the customs were appropriated. Charles Squire
    says," An ingenious theory was invented after the introduction of
    Christianity, with the purpose of allowing such ancient rites to
    continue with a changed meaning. The passing of persons and cattle
    through flame or smoke was explained as a practice which interposed
    a magic protection between them and the powers of evil."<sup>4</sup>
    This is precisely what the original festival was intended to do;
    only the definition of "evil" had changed. These old customs
    continued to be practiced in many areas for centuries. "In Scotland
    in 1282, John, the priest in Iverkething, led the young girls of his
    parish in a phallic dance of decidedly obscene character during
    Easter week. For this, penance was laid upon him, but his punishment
    was not severe, and he was allowed to retain his
    benefice."<sup>5</sup>

10. Were sacrifices practiced during this festival?

    Scholars are divided in their opinions of this. There is no
    surviving account of sacrifices in the legends and mythology which
    have come down to us. As these were originally set down on paper by
    Christian monks, one would think that if such a thing had been
    regularly practiced, the good brothers would most certainly have
    recorded it, if for no other reason than to make the pagans look
    more depraved. There are, however, some surviving folk customs which
    point to a person representing the gloom and ill fortune of winter
    being ostracized and forced to jump through the fires. Some scholars
    see this as a survival of ancient human sacrificial practices. The
    notion that animals were sacrificed during this time doesn't make
    sense from a practical standpoint. The animals which had been
    retained a breeding stock through the winter would either be lean
    and hungry from winter feed, or would be mothers nursing young,
    which could not be spared.

11. How do modern day pagans observe this day?

    Modern day pagan observances of Beltane include the maypole dances,
    bringing in the May, and jumping the cauldron for fertility. Many
    couples wishing to conceive children will jump the cauldron together
    at this time. Fertility of imagination and other varieties of
    fertility are invoked along with sexual fertility. In Wiccan and
    other Pagan circles, this is a joyous day, full of laughter and good
    times.

12. What about Walpurgisnacht? Is this the same thing as Beltane?

    Walpurgisnacht comes from an Eastern European background, and has
    little in common with the Celtic practices. I have not studied the
    folklore from that region and do not consider myself qualified to
    write about it. As the vast majority of Wiccan traditions today stem
    from Celtic roots, I have confined myself to research in those
    areas.
