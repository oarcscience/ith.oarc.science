              work as well  as focal  points and concentration  aids for  centuries.
              Each different color  has a  different meaning for  both internal  and
              external  uses.   Here  are a  list of  uses  put together  by Charles
              Butler.

              free to use your own words but  we ask that you use Greek styling  and
              personify with the names of the four Greek winds: 
               
                                                 North:  Boreus

              altar, and  invokes God and Goddess  in a Greek style  using these two
              triumverates: 
               
                                                       GOD 
                                                 Zeus:  Strength 
                                                Hades:  Knowledge 
                                               Poseidon:  Emotion

                                                Aphrodite:  Love 
               
               
                          He then stepback andsays: "We havebeen calledforth fromthe
              edges  of  Time and  Space by  one  who seeks  entry to  the  Halls of
              Olympus.  I  am Tiresias, Prophet of Thebes, who,  though blind, shall
              be his guide.  Seeker, come forth!" 
               


                                                                                 984
              


                    Seeker approaches circle at north-east point of Circle. 
               
                    Tiresias:  "Who seeks entry to Olympus?" 
                    Seeker:  "I, __________. 
                          Tiresias: "Beforeyou enter,gaze uponone whosought whatwas 
                             not rightfully his.  Do you still desire entry?" 
                    Seeker replies. 
                          Tiresias:  (If no,he leaves and circleis closed.  Ifyes): 
              "Then enter and ask passage of the Guardians of the Gods." 
                    Seeker enters and they travel 1 1/8 to North. 
               
                          Tiresias:  "Hail, MightyHephaestus, Craftsman of the Gods.
              With me is one who seeks entry to Olympus." 
                    Hephaestus:  "How are you known, Seeker?" 
                    Seeker:  "I am called __________." 
                          Hephaestus:"By whatright seekyoupassage throughthe North?"
                          Seeker: "I haveendured ayear of thepath ofEarth andlearned
                            of my own mortality." 
                    Hephaestus:  "Pass with the Blessings of the Earth." 
                    They travel around 1 1/4 to East. 
               
                          Tiresias: "Hail,Vigilant Artemis,Virgin Goddess. Withme is
                                  one who seeks entry to Olympus." 
                    Artemis:  "How are you known, Seeker?" 
                    Seeker:  "I am called __________." 
                    Artemis:  "By what right seek you passage through the East?" 
                          Seeker:  "I have endured a year of the path of Airand have
              learned the need for focus of will." 
                    Artemis:  "Pass with the Blessings of the Air." 
                    They travel around 1 1/4 to South. 
               
                          Tiresias: "Hail, Bright Apollo, Lordof the Sun. With me is
              one who seeks entry to Olympus." 
                    Apollo:  "How are you known, Seeker?" 
                    Seeker:  "I am called __________." 
                    Apollo:  "By what right seek you passage through the South?" 
                    Seeker has no answer. 
                          Apollo: "Youhave not yetearned theright topass through the
                             South.  To win this  right, you must seek Fire from  he
              who first gave it to Mankind, Prometheus.  Tiresias,             guard
              him upon his path of Fire that he learn what he             needs   to
              face the Titan." 
                    They travel around 1 1/2 to North. 
               
                          Tiresias:  "Icome with __________, whonow seeks Prometheus
              that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
              him that will ease his path?" 


                                                                                 985
              


                          Hephaestus: "Knowthat Iam Hephaestus,Craftsman andSmith of
                                  the Gods.  In my labors, I use Fire as a purifying
                                  agent, seperating  the metal from  the stone,  and
              for the actual forging of my Art.  But remember                  that
              creativity requires forethought.  Daedalus                  w a s    a
              Master of my Craft, yet rarely considered                   t   h   e
              implications of his creations.  He created the 
              Labyrinth of Minos, who then imprisoned him within               i t s
              intricacies.  He crafted wing that he and his                    s o n
              might escape, yet in their flight Icarus died.  
              Always consider the consequences of the which you 
              create." 
                    They travel 1 1/4 around to East. 
               
                          Tiresias: "I come with __________,who now seeks Prometheus
              that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
              him that will ease his path?" 
                          Artemis: "Knowthat I amArtemis, VirginHuntress. Through my
                                  will,  no man has ever known me.  Yet will must be
                                  tempered  by  intellegence.    Remember  Otus  and
              Ephialtes, twin giants who were arrogant enough to               think
              themselves better than the Gods. They                  continued their
              ill-wrought plans, even after                     Poseidon      warned
              them.  Through supposed desire,                   they chose to pursue
              me.  They seperated in                  pursuit of what they saw  as a
              white hind, and,                   with simultaneous throws, slew each
              other.  Thus                  blind will caused the death  of all they
              truly                    loved." 
                    They travel 1 1/4 around to the South 
               
                          Tiresias:  "Icome with __________, whonow seeks Prometheus
              that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
              him that will ease his path?" 
                          Apollo:  "Know thatI am Apollo, Godof the Sun andKeeper of
              Knowledge.  Knowledge of Fire has allowed Man to                 forge
              a civilization.  But seeking to advance                     without
              can lead to catastrophe.  Witness                 Phaethon,        who
              attempted to drive the Sun Chariot                     without  proper
              knowledge, nearly causing the                     incineration  of the
              Earth.  Action without                  knowledge  will often  lead to
              ruin." 
                    They travel around 1 1/4 to the West. 
               
                          Tiresias: "I come with__________, who now seeks Prometheus
              that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
              him that will ease his path?" 
                          Hestia: "Know that I amHestia, Goddess of Hearthand Home. 
              The warm glow of emotion in balance is vital for 
              proper growth and life.  But when emotions are 
              allowed to rule above all else, tragedy is soon to 
              follow.  Consider Paris, who upon seeing Helen,                  bowed
              to an all-consuming desire for her,                    kidnapping  her
              without thought of the                  consequences.   Thus began the
              Trojan War.  Do not                     bury   your    emotions,   but
              neither should you elevate                   them  to   the  level  of
              Ruler. 


                                                                                 986
              


                          Theytravel 1 3/4around to theSouth.  Tiresiasalone goes to
              altar and faces Seeker. 
               
                          Tiresias: "Seeker,are youprepared toface Prometheushimself
                                  with your request?" 
                    Seeker:  "I am." 
                    Tiresias:  "Then come forward and call him forth." 
                    Seeker goes to altar facing North. 
               
                          Seeker: "From the depths of Time, I call you forth.  Arise
              Prometheus, Lightbringer." 
                          Fromwithinthe membersin theCircle,Prometheus risesand goes
              to north side of altar. 
               
                    Prometheus:  "I am Prometheus.  Who summons me here?" 
                    Seeker:  "I am __________." 
                          Prometheus: "Why haveyou brought me herefrom the depths of
              Time?" 
                    Seeker:  "I seek the Gift of Fire." 
                    Prometheus:  "And by what right do you ask it? 
                    Seeker:  "By the right of perfect love and perfect trust." 
                          Prometheus: "Thenknow thatyou are wellmet. I willgrant you
                                  Fire and  its path for  a year and a  day that you
              might learn its lessons.  The most important 
              lesson it can teach you is the need for thought 
              before action of any kind.  You must always                 consider
              the consequences of all that you do or                 say.    At  the
