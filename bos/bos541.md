         To: All
         Re: Re: Tools Etc.      

         This was originally a post by Song Bird in the Herbalism echo.  I
         thought it was interesting enough to cross-post it to some of the
         magical echos.
         Note to all:  I appologize for the exceedingly lengthy nature of this
         post. My thought was that unless you, dear reader, have been following
         the posts on this topic, an edited response would be really obscure.
         And thank you, Song Bird, for this post to which I am responding.  Gave
         me pause for thought, for sure!  Bless you!

         Wiccan, ceremonial magic and generic Neo-pagan, yes...

         I suppose I would say that theoretically any magic that can be worked
         with ritual and/or tools can also be done without.  The caveat with this
         is that most of us (self included) don't have the skills, knowledge
         and/or power to do without the ritual/tools for certain complicated
         powerful working, IMHO.  Though perhaps if we worked without tools or
         ritual more often we'd get better at it... ;)  Seriously, though, I'm
         not advocating dropping the tools or ritual --- they're useful.  And I
         think it's better to do what's useful than to work until you're ninety
         before you finally get good at it!

         SB>Tools sometimes mean much more than just a focus, more than just a
         SB>way to get to where you are going. Ofttimes the tools themselves are
         SB>invested of the very life necessary to work the magic.

         You're speaking here of tools which carry energy or intelligence, I
         assume?  I was refering to tools which are made by the worker or by
         another worker for the purpose of someone else using them.  In my
         understanding tools are more useful if they carry energy or
         intelligence.  If they do, it's because the worker put it there.  I
         differentiate these from tools which acquire energy or intelligence
         through a process other than human intervention.



                                                                                2391

         It sounds to me like in that circumstance we are depriving ourselves of
         the opportunity to work with another intelligence. When you use the word
         "soul" I presume you mean "entity" as well, to which I attribute some
         level of intelligence.

         SB>Any tradition that believes in the vesting of power down through the
         SB>centuries, in the passing of knowledge, known or unknown, unto it's
         heirs,

         Not tools.  The vesting of power and passing of knowledge is through (as
         I comprehend it currently) the partnership of human and deity.  As I see
         it, the process of initiation (which many workers use, including all of
         the shamanistic paths that I know anything about) does several things:
         1) charters the individual with membership in the group with all the
         rights and responsibilities involved thereof.  2) Passes power or
         knowledge from the initiator to the initiate (sometimes the power or
         knowledge is seen as coming from elsewhere, such as a deity).  3)
         Formally introduces the initiate to the energy and/or deities of the
         tradition.  4) Creates a new personality for the initiate which
         sometimes supplants the old one.  I'm sure there are points I've missed
         and not all initiations do all these things.

         SB>What is this personal power you use?  Certainly that power is from
         SB>within, utilizing nothing from without, if you deny the use of tools.

         Not necessarily or entirely; I don't consider the ambient power of the
         universe a "tool" per se.  I differentiate between energy and a tool.

         SB>What, precisely, is a tool?

         Good question!  Does this fall into the same kind of discussion as "what
         is a witch", perhaps? :)   IMHO a tool must be an object, either
         physical or an astral representation of a physical object.  If it's not
         an object, if it's an entity, energy, intelligence, spirit, or whatever,
         it's not a tool, it's a partner (or servant in some circles).

         SB>What, precisely, is personal power?

         I think of personal power as the ability to exercise one's abilities.
         To whatever degree you have the energy, skill and knowledge to do so,
         you have personal power. This includes the energy, skill and knowledge
         to draw on power from outside your physical/astral/whatever being.

         SB>Are the gods a tool, or power, and can we cast without them?

         The gods I deal with are real entities with minds, thoughts, feelings,
         histories and agendas of their own.  They aren't psychological
         constructs, or sheer power, or tools.  If by "cast" you mean what I mean
         by "work", I say yes.



                                                                                2392

         SB>Is inherented knowledge passed through the centuries personal power, or
         a
         SB>tool, and can we cast without it?

         I think of power as energy, but perhaps the power passed by initiation
         is both information and energy (thus including knowledge).  I conceive
         of the power of an inititiatory line (of whatever flavor) as a stream, a
         line of connection to which all members of that line, living and dead,
         connect.  We can draw on the knowledge and energy of the line, or we can
         work without it.  I don't think of it as exactly personal, as it belongs
         to everyone in the line.

         SB>Are the spirits that surrounds us a part of us and a power to be used,
         or
         SB>some seperate entity and a tool to be cast aside?

         Spirits are entities, as near as I can figure, and that makes them
         neither powers nor tools.  There's a difference, for example, between
         drawing on the energy of the moon and making a connection with the
         spirit of the moon.

         SB>At times, the definitions of tools and power become too intermixed
         SB>to seperate.  Perhaps, we are nothing without our tools.  Perhaps,
         SB>there really are no tools.  Perhaps, we are the tool.  I challenge
         SB>that what we are comes from without and that there is nothing that
         SB>we do today or any other that will increase or refine our power one
         SB>wit *unless* we reach outwards.  What we become will pass to the
         SB>generations.  What has been is within and a tool as surely as any
         SB>other.
         I have real difficulty accepting that all I am comes from without.
         That makes me too much defined by that which surrounds me, and binds me
         to be what the outside (parents, friends, society) says I am.  I don't
         believe I am a tool, even of my deities.  I do agree that without input
         from that which surrounds us, we don't have any opportunity for growth
         and development.  That is where connections are so important, and why it
         is so important for us to connect with that which nourishes us,
         rather than that which stunts or devours us.  What we pass to the
         generations depends on the quality of our lives and works.
