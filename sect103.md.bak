# What is a Collection Copyright?

The following is an excerpt from the [Copyright Law of the United
States](https://www.loc.gov/copyright/title17/circ92.html.md):

### § 103. Subject matter of copyright: Compilations and derivative works

\(a\) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102
includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work
employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not
extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used
unlawfully.

\(b\) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to
the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished
from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply
any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such
work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope,
duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the
preexisting material.
