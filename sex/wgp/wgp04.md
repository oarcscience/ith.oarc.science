### Priapus Worship

Antiquity had made Priapus a god, the middle ages raised him into a
saint, and that under several names.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

\[paragraph continues\] In the south of France, Provence, Languedoc, and
the Lyonnais, he was worshipped under the title of St. Foutin. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) This name is said to be a mere corruption
of Fotinus or Photinus, the first bishop of Lyons, to whom, perhaps
through giving a vulgar interpretation to the name, people had
transferred the distinguishing attribute of Priapus. This was a large
phallus of wood, which was an object of reverence to the women,
especially to those who were barren, who scraped the wooden member, and,
having steeped the scrapings in water, they drank the latter as a remedy
against their barrenness, or administered it to their husbands in the
belief that it would make them vigorous. The worship of this saint, as
it was practiced in various places in France at the commencement of the
seventeenth century, is described in that singular book, the *Confession
de Sancy*. <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) We there learn that at
Varailles in Provence, waxen images of the members of both sexes were
offered to St. Foutin, and suspended to the ceiling of his chapel, and
the writer remarks that, as the ceiling was covered with them, when the
wind blew them about, it

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

produced an effect which was calculated to disturb very much the
devotions of the worshippers. We hardly need remark that this is just
the same kind of worship which existed at Isernia, in the kingdom of
Naples, where it was presented in the same shape. At Embrun, in the
department of the Upper Alps, the phallus of St. Foutin was worshipped
in a different form; the women poured a libation of wine upon the head
of the phallus, which was collected in a vessel, in which it was left
till it became sour; it was then called the "sainte vinaigre," and the
women employed it for a purpose which is only obscurely hinted at. When
the Protestants took Embrun in 1585, they found this phallus laid up
carefully among the relics in the principal church, its head red with
the wine which had been poured upon it. A much larger phallus of wood,
covered with leather, was an object of worship in the church of St.
Eutropius at Orange, but it was seized by the Protestants and burnt
publicly in 1562. St. Foutin was similarly an object of worship at
Porigny, at Cives in the diocese of Viviers, at Vendre in the
Bourbonnais, at Auxerre, at Puy-en-Velay, in the convent of Girouet near
Sampigny, and in other places. At a distance of about four leagues from
Clermont in Auvergne, there is (or was) an isolated rock, which presents
the form of an immense phallus, and which is popularly called

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

\[paragraph continues\] St. Foutin. Similar phallic saints were
worshipped under the names of St. Guerlichon, or Greluchon, at
Bourg-Dieu in the diocese of Bourges, of St. Gilles in the Cotentin in
Britany, of St. Rene in Anjou, of St. Regnaud in Burgundy, of St.
Arnaud, and above all of St. Guignolé near Brest and at the village of
La Chatelette in Berri. Many of these were still in existence and their
worship in full practice in the last century; in some of them, the
wooden phallus is described as being much worn down by the continual
process of scraping, while in others the loss sustained by scraping was
always restored by a miracle. This miracle, however, was a very clumsy
one, for the phallus consisted of a long staff of wood passed through a
hole in the middle of the body, and as the phallic end in front became
shortened, a blow of a mallet from behind thrust it forward, so that it
was restored to its original length.

It appears that it was also the practice to worship these saints in
another manner, which also was derived from the forms of the worship of
Priapus among the ancients, with whom it was the custom, in the nuptial
ceremonies, for the bride to offer up her virginity to Priapus, and this
was done by placing her sexual parts against the end of the phallus, and
sometimes introducing the latter, and even completing the sacrifice.
This ceremony is represented in a

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

bas-relief in marble, an engraving of which is given in the *Musée
Secret* of the antiquities of Herculaneum and Pompeii; its object was to
conciliate the favour of the god, and to avert sterility. It is
described by the early Christian writers, such as Lactantius and
Arnobius, as a very common practice among the Romans; and it still
prevails to a great extent over most part of the East, from India to
Japan and the islands of the Pacific. In a public square in Batavia,
there is a cannon taken from the natives and placed there as a trophy by
the Dutch government. It presents the peculiarity that the touch-hole is
made on a phallic hand, the thumb placed in the position which is called
the "fig," and which we shall have to describe a little further on. It
is always the same idea of reverence to the fertilizing powers of
nature, of which the garland or the bunch of flowers was an appropriate
emblem. There are traces of the existence of this practice in the middle
ages. In the case of some of the priapic saints mentioned above, women
sought a remedy for barrenness by kissing the end of the phallus;
sometimes they appear to have placed a part of their body naked against
the image of the saint, or to have sat upon it. This latter trait was
perhaps too bold an adoption of the indecencies of pagan worship to last
long, or to be [practiced](errata.htm#0.md) openly; but it appears to have
been more innocently represented by lying

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

upon the body of the saint, or sitting upon a stone, understood to
represent him without the presence of the energetic member. In a corner
in the church of the village of St. Fiacre, near Mouceaux in France,
there is a stone called the chair of St. Fiacre, which confers fecundity
upon women who sit upon it; but it is necessary that nothing should
intervene between their bare skin and the stone. In the church of
Orcival in Auvergne, there was a pillar which barren women kissed for
the same purpose, and which had perhaps replaced some less equivocal
object. <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) Traditions, at least, of
similar practices were connected with St. Foutin, for it appears to have
been the custom for girls on the point of marriage to offer their last
maiden robe to that saint. This superstition prevailed to such an extent
that it became proverbial. A story is told of a young bride who, on the
wedding night, sought to deceive her husband on the question of her
previous chastity, although, as the writer expresses it, "she had long
ago deposited the robe of her virginity on the altar of St. Foutin."
From this form of superstition is said to have arisen a vice which is
understood to prevail especially in

nunneries--the use by women of artificial phalli, which appears in its
origin to have been a religious ceremony. It certainly existed at a very
remote period, for it is distinctly alluded to in the Scriptures, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) where it is evidently considered as a
part of pagan worship. It is found at an early period of the middle
ages, described in the Ecclesiastical Penitentials, with its appropriate
amount of penitence. One of these penitential canons of the eighth
century speaks of "a woman who, by herself or with the help of another
woman, commits uncleanness," for which she was to do penance for three
years, one on bread and water; and if this uncleanness was committed
with a nun, the penance was increased to seven years, two only on bread
and water. Another Penitential of an early date provides for the case in
which both the women who participated in this act should be nuns; and
Burchardus, bishop of Worms, one of the most celebrated authorities on
such subjects, describes the instrument and use of it in greater detail.
The practice had evidently lost its religious character and degenerated
into a mere indulgence of the passions.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

Antwerp has been described as the Lampsacus of Belgium, and Priapus was,
down to a comparatively modern period, its patron saint, under the name
of Ters, a word the deriviation of which appears to be unknown, but
which was identical in meaning with the Greek *phallus* and the Latin
*fascinum*. John Goropius Becan, who published a learned treatise on the
antiquities of Antwerp in the middle of the sixteenth century, informs
us how much this Ters was reverenced in his time by the Antwerpians,
especially by the women, who invoked it on every occasion when they were
taken by surprise or sudden fear. <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md)
He states that "if they let fall by accident a vessel of earthenware, or
stumbled, or if any unexpected accident caused them vexation, even the
most respectable women called aloud for the protection of Priapus under
this obscene name." Goropius Becanus adds that there was in his time,
over the door of a house adjoining the prison, a statue which had been
furnished with a large phallus, then worn away or broken off. Among
other writers who mention this statue is Abraham Golnitz, who published
an account of his travels in France and Belgium, in 1631 <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) and he informs us that it was a carving
in stone, about a foot

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

high, with its arms raised up, and its legs spread out, and that the
phallus had been entirely worn out by the women, who had been in the
habit of scraping it and making a potion of the dust which they drank as
a preservative against barrenness. Golnitz further tells us that a
figure of Priapus was placed over the entrance gate to the enclosure of
the temple of St. Walburgis at Antwerp, which some antiquaries imagined
to have been built on the site of a temple dedicated to that deity. It
appears from these writers that, at certain times, the women of Antwerp
decorated the phalli of these figures with garlands.
