### Phallic Festivals

Besides the invocations addressed principally to Priapus, or to the
generative powers, the ancients had established great festivals in their
honour, which were remarkable for their licentious gaiety, and in which
the image of the phallus was carried openly and in triumph. These
festivities were especially celebrated among the rural population, and
they were held chiefly during the summer months. The preparatory labours
of the agriculturist were over,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

and people had leisure to welcome with joyfulness the activity of
nature's reproductive powers, which was in due time to bring their
fruits. Among the most celebrated of these festivals were the Liberalia,
which were held on the 17th of March. A monstrous phallus was carried in
procession in a car, and its worshippers indulged loudly and openly in
obscene songs, conversation, and attitudes, and when it halted, the most
respectable of the matrons ceremoniously crowned the head of the phallus
with a garland. The Bacchanalia, representing the Dionysia of the
Greeks, were celebrated in the latter part of October, when the harvest
was completed, and were attended with much the same ceremonies as the
Liberalia. The phallus was similarly carried in
[procession](errata.htm#1.md), and crowned, and, as in the Liberalia, the
festivities being carried on into the night, as the celebrators became
heated with wine, they degenerated into the extreme of licentiousness,
in which people indulged without a blush in the most infamous vices. The
festival of Venus was celebrated towards the beginning of April, and in
it the phallus was again carried in its car, and led in procession by
the Roman ladies to the temple of Venus outside the Colline gate, and
there presented by them to the sexual parts of the goddess. This part of
the scene is represented in a well-known intaglio, which has

been published in several works on antiquities. At the close of the
month last mentioned came the Floralia, which, if possible, excelled all
the others in licence. Ausonius, in whose time (the latter half of the
fourth century) the Floralia were still in full force, speaks of their
lasciviousness-

Nee non lascivi Floralia læta theatri,  
  Quæ spectare volunt qui voluisse negant.  
                Ausonii *Eclog. de Feriis Romanis*.

The loose women of the town and its neighbourhood, called together by
the sounding of horns, mixed with the multitude in perfect nakedness,
and excited their passions with obscene motions and language, until the
festival ended in a scene of mad revelry, in which all restraint was
laid aside. Juvenal describes a Roman dame of very depraved manners as-

. . . . Dignissima prorsus  
Florali matrona tuba.  
                       Juvenalis *Sat*. vi, I. 249.

These scenes of unbounded licence and depravity, deeply rooted in
people's minds by long established customs, caused so little public
scandal, that it is related of Cato the younger that, when he was
present at the celebration of the Floralia, instead of showing any
disapproval of them, he retired, that his well-known gravity might be no
restraint upon them, because the multitude manifested some hesitation in

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

stripping the women naked in the presence of a man so celebrated for his
modesty. The festivals more specially dedicated to Priapus, the
Priapeia, were attended with similar ceremonies and similarly licentious
orgies. Their forms and characteristics are better known, because they
are so frequently represented to us as the subjects of works of Roman
art. The Romans had other festivals of similar character, but of less
importance, some of which were of a more private character, and some
were celebrated in strict privacy. Such were the rites of the Bona Dea,
established among the Roman matrons in the time of the republic, the
disorders of which are described in such glowing language by the
satirist Juvenal, in his enumeration of the vices of the Roman women:--

Nota Bonæ secreta Deæ, quum tibia lumbos  
Incitat, et cornu pariter vinoque feruntur  
Attonitæ, crinemque rotant, ululantque Priapi  
Mænades. O quantus tunc illis mentibus ardor  
Concubitus! quæ vox saltante libidine! quantus  
Ille meri veteris per crura madentia torrens!  
Lenonum ancillas posita Saufeia corona  
Provocat, et tollit pendentis præmia coxæ.  
Ipsa Medullinæ fluctum crissantis adorat.  
Palmam inter dominas virtus natalibus æquat.  
Nil ibi per ludum simulabitur: omnia fient  
Ad verum, quibus incendi jam frigidus ævo  
Laomedontiades et Nestoris hernia possit.  
Tunc prurigo moræ impatiens, tunc femina simplex,  
Et toto pariter repetitus clamor ab antro:  
Jam fas est: admitte viros!--Juvenalis Sat. vi, l. 314.

 

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

Among the Teutonic, as well as among most other peoples, similar
festivals appear to have been celebrated during the summer months; and,
as they arose out of the same feelings, they no doubt presented the same
general forms. The principal popular festivals of the summer during the
middle ages occurred in the months of April, May, and June, and
comprised Easter, May-day, and the feast of the summer solstice. All
these appear to have been originally accompanied with the same phallic
worship which formed the principal characteristic of the great Roman
festivals; and, in fact, these are exactly those popular institutions
and traits of popular manners which were most likely to outlive, also
without any material change, the overthrow of the Roman empire by the
barbarians. Although, at the time when we become intimately acquainted
with these festivals, most of the prominent marks of their phallic
character had been abandoned and forgotten, yet we meet during the
interval with scattered indications which leave no room to doubt of
their former existence. It will be interesting to examine into some of
these points, and to show the influence they exerted on mediæval
society.

The first of the three great festivals just mentioned was purely
Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic; but it appears in the first place to have been
identified with the

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Roman Liberalia, and it was further transformed
by the Catholic church into one of the great Christian religious feasts.
In the primitive Teutonic mythology there was a female deity named, in
Old German, *Ostara*, and, in Anglo-Saxon, *Eastre*, or *Eostre*, but
all we know of her is the simple statement of our father of history,
Bede, that her festival was celebrated by the ancient Saxons in the
month of April, from which circumstance, that month was named by the
Anglo-Saxons *Easter-monath*, or *Eoster-monath*, and that the name of
the goddess had been subsequently given to the Paschal time, with which
it was identical. The name of this goddess was given to the same month
by the old Germans and by the Franks, so that she must have been one of
the most highly honoured of the Teutonic deities, and her festival must
have been a very important one, and deeply implanted in the popular
feelings, or the church would not have sought to identify it with one of
the greatest Christian festivals of the year. It is understood that the
Romans considered this month as dedicated to Venus, no doubt because it
was that in which the productive power of nature began to be visibly
developed. When the Pagan festival was adopted by the church, it became
a moveable feast instead of being fixed to the month of April. Among
other objects offered to the goddess at this time were

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

cakes, made no doubt of fine flour, but of their form we are ignorant.
The Christians, when they seized upon the Easter festival, gave them the
form of a bun, which, indeed, was at that time the ordinary form of
bread; and to protect themselves, and those who eat them, from any
enchantment, or other evil influences which might arise from their
former heathen character, they marked them with the Christian
symbol--the cross. Hence were derived the cakes we still eat at Easter
under the name of hot-cross-buns, and the superstitious feelings
attached to them, for multitudes of people still believe that if they
failed to eat a hot-cross-bun on Good-Friday they would be unlucky all
the rest of the year. But there is some reason for believing that, at
least in some parts, the Easter-cakes had originally a different
form--that of the phallus. Such at least appears to have been the case
in France, where the custom still exists. In Saintonge, in the
neighbourhood of La Rochelle, small cakes, baked in the form of a
phallus, are made as offerings at Easter, and are carried and presented
from house to house; and we have been informed that similar practices
exist in some other places. When Dulaure wrote, the festival of Palm
Sunday, in the town of Saintes, was called the *fête des pinnes*,
*pinne* being a popular and vulgar word for the *membrum virile*. At
this *fête* the women

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

and children carried in the procession, at the end of their palm
branches, a phallus made of bread, which they called undisguisedly a
*pinne*, and which, having been blest by the priest, the women carefully
preserved during the following year as an amulet. A similar practice
existed at St. Jean-d'Angély, where small cakes, made in the form of the
phallus, and named *fateux*, were carried in the procession of the
Fête-Dieu, or Corpus Christi. <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md)
Shortly before the time when Dulaure wrote, this practice was suppressed
by a new sous-préfet, M. Maillard. The custom of making cakes in the
form of the sexual members, male and female, dates from a remote
antiquity and was common among the Romans. Martial made a phallus of
bread (*Priapus siligineus*) the subject of an epigram of two lines:--

Si vis esse satur, nostrum potes esse priapum:  
   Ipse licet rodas inguina, purus eris.  
                              Martial, lib. xiv, ep. 69.

The same writer speaks of the image of a female organ made of the same
material in another of his epigrams, to explain which, it is only
necessary to state that these images were composed of the finest wheaten
flour (*siligo*):--

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Pauper amicitiæ cum sis, Lupe, non es amicæ;  
   Et queritur de te mentula sola nihil.  
Illa siligineis pinguescit adultera cunnis;  
   Convivam pascit nigra farina tuum.  
                               Martial, lib. ix, ep. 3.

This custom appears to have been preserved from the Romans through the
middle ages, and may be traced distinctly as far back as the fourteenth
or fifteenth century. We are informed that in some of the earlier
inedited French books on cookery, receipts are given for making cakes in
these obscene forms, which are named without any concealment; and the
writer on this subject, who wrote in the sixteenth century, Johannes
Bruerinus Campegius, describing the different forms in which cakes were
then made, enumerates those of the secret members of both sexes, a
proof, he says of "the degeneracy of manners, when Christians themselves
can delight in obscenities and immodest things even among their articles
of food." He adds that some of these were commonly spoken of by a gross
name, *des cons sucrés*. When Dulaure wrote, that is just forty years
ago, cakes of these forms continued to be made in various parts of
France, and he informs us that those representing the male organ were
made in the Lower Limousin, and especially at Brives, while similar
images of the female organ were made at Clermont

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

in Auvergne, and in other places. They were popularly called
*miches*. <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md)

There is another custom attached to Easter, which has probably some
relation to the worship of which we are treating, and which seems once
to have prevailed throughout England, though we believe it is now
confined to Shropshire and Cheshire. In the former county it is called
*heaving*, in the latter *lifting*. On Easter Monday the men go about
with chairs, seize the women they meet, and, placing them in the chairs,
raise them up, turn them round two or three times, and then claim the
right of kissing them. On Easter Tuesday, the same thing is done by the
women to the men. This, of course, is only practiced now among the lower
classes, except sometimes as a frolic among intimate friends. The chair
appears to have been a comparatively modern addition, since such
articles have become more abundant. In the last century four or five of
the one sex took the victim of the other sex by the arms and legs, and
lifted her or him in that manner, and the operation was attended, at all
events on the part of the men, with much indecency. The women usually
expect a small contribution of money from the men they have lifted. More
anciently, in the time of Durandus, that is, in

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the thirteenth century, a still more singular custom prevailed on these
two days. He tells us that in many countries, on the Easter Monday, it
was the rule for the wives to beat their husbands, and that on the
Tuesday the husbands beat their wives. Brand, in his *Popular
Antiquities*, tells us that in the city of Durham, in his time, it was
the custom for the men, on the one day, to take off the women's shoes,
which the latter were obliged to purchase back, and that on the other
day the women did the same to the men.
