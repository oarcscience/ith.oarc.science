### The 'Fig'

There was another, and less openly apparent, form of the phallus, which
has lasted as an amulet during almost innumerable ages. The ancients had
two forms of what antiquaries have named the phallic hand, one in which
the middle finger was extended at length, and the thumb and other
fingers doubled up, while in the other the whole hand was closed, but
the thumb was passed between the first and middle

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

fingers. The first of these forms appears to have been the more ancient,
and is understood to have been intended to represent, by the extended
middle finger, the *membrum virile*, and by the bent fingers on each
side the testicles. Hence the middle finger of the hand was called by
the Romans, *digitus impudicus*, or *infamis*. It was called by the
Greeks καταπύγων, which had somewhat the same meaning as the Latin word,
except that it had reference especially to degrading practices, which
were then less concealed than in modern times. To show the hand in this
form was expressed in Greek by the word πκιμαλίζειν, and was considered
as a most contemptuous insult, because it was understood to intimate
that the person to whom it was addressed was addicted to unnatural vice.
This was the meaning also given to it by the Romans, as we learn from
the first lines of an epigram of Martial:--

"Rideto, multum, qui te, Sextille, cinædum  
       Dixerit, et *digitum* porrigito *medium*."  
                                  Martial, *Ep*. ii, 28.

Nevertheless, this gesture of the hand was looked upon at an early
period as an amulet against magical influences, and, formed of different
materials, it was carried on the person in the same manner as the
phallus. It is not an uncommon object among Roman

antiquities, and was adopted by the Gnostics as one of their symbolical
images. The second of these forms of the phallic hand, the intention of
which is easily seen (the thumb forming the phallus), was also well
known among the Romans, and is found made of various material, such as
bronze, coral, lapis lazuli, and chrystal, of a size which was evidently
intended to be suspended to the neck or to some other part of the
person. In the *Musée Secret* at Naples, there are examples of such
amulets, in the shape of two arms joined at the elbow, one terminating
in the head of a phallus, the other having a hand arranged in the form
just described, which seem to have been intended for pendents to ladies'
ears. This gesture of the hand appears to have been called at a later
period of Latin, though we have no knowledge of the date at which this
use of the word began, *ficus*, a fig. *Ficus* being a word in the
feminine gender, appears to have fallen in the popular language into the
more common form of feminine nouns, *fica*, out of which arose the
Italian *fica* (now replaced by *fico*), the Spanish *higa*, and the
French *figue*. Florio, who gives the word *fica*, a fig, says that it
was also used in the sense of "a woman's quaint," so that it may perhaps
be classed with one or two other fruits, such as the pomegranate and the
apricot,

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

to which a similar erotic meaning was given. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) The form, under this name, was preserved
through the middle ages, especially in the South of Europe, where Roman
traditions were strongest, both as an amulet and as an insulting
gesture. The Italian called this gesture *fare la fica*, to make or do
the fig to any one; the Spaniard, *dar una higa*, to give a fig; and the
Frenchman, like the Italian, *faire la figue*. We can trace this phrase
back to the thirteenth century at least. In the judicial proceedings
against the Templars in Paris in 1309, one of the brethren of the Order
was asked, jokingly, in his examination, because he was rather loose and
flippant in his replies, "if he bad been ordered by the said receptor
(the officer of the Templars who admitted the new candidate) to make
with his fingers the fig at the crucifix." Here the word used is the
correct Latin *ficus*; and it is the same in the plural, in a document
of the year 1449, in which an individual is said to have *made figs*
with both hands at another. This phrase appears to have been introduced
into the English language in the time of Elizabeth and to have been
taken from the Spaniards, with whom our relations were then intimate.
This we

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

assume from the circumstance that the English phrase was "to give the
fig" (*dar la higa*), <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) and that the
writers of the Elizabethan age call it "the fig of Spain." Thus, ancient
"Pistol, in Shakespeare:--

----"A figo for thy friendship!--  
The fig of Spain." *Henry V*, III. 6.

The phrase has been preserved in all these countries down to modern
times and we still say in English, "a fig for anybody," or "for
anything," not meaning that we estimate them at no more than the value
of a fig, but that we throw at them that contempt which was intimated by
showing them the phallic hand, and which the Greeks, as stated above,
called σκιμαλίζειν. The form of showing contempt which was called the
fig is still well known among the lower classes of society in England,
and it is preserved in most of the countries of Western Europe. In
Baretti's Spanish Dictionary, which belongs to the commencement of the
present century, we find the word *higa* interpreted as "A manner of
scoffing at people, which consists in showing the thumb between the
first and second finger, closing the first, and pointing at the person
to whom we want to give this hateful mark of contempt." Baretti also
gives as still in use the original meaning of the word, "*Higa*, a
little hand

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

made of jet, which they hang about children to keep them from evil eyes;
a superstitious custom." The use of this amulet is still common in
Italy, and especially in Naples and Sicily; it has an advantage over the
mere form of the phallus, that when the artificial *fica* is not
present, an individual, who finds or believes himself in sudden danger,
can make the amulet with his own fingers. So profound is the belief of
its efficacy in Italy, that it is commonly believed and reported there
that, at the battle of Solferino, the king of Italy held his hand in his
pocket with this arrangement of the fingers as a protection against the
shots of the enemy.
