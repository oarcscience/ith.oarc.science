### Shelah-na-Gigs

It is a singular fact that in Ireland it was the female organ which was
shown in this position of protector upon the churches, and the elaborate
though rude manner in which these figures were sculptured, show that
they were considered as objects of great importance. They represented a
female exposing herself

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

to view in the most unequivocal manner, and are carved on a block which
appears to have served as the key-stone to the arch of the door-way of
the church, where they were presented to the gaze of all who entered.
They appear to have been found principally in the very old churches, and
have been mostly taken down, so that they are only found among the
ruins. People have given them the name of *Shelah-na-Gig*, which, we are
told, means in Irish Julian the Giddy, and is simply a term for an
immodest woman; but it is well understood that they were intended as
protecting charms against the fascination of the evil eye. We have given
copies of all the examples yet known in our [plates
V](wgp02.htm#img_pl05) and [VI](#img_pl06.md). The first of these  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) was found in an old church at Rochestown,
in the county of Tipperary, where it had long been known among the
people of the neighbourhood by the name given above. It was placed in
the arch over the doorway, but has since been taken away. Our second
example of the Shelah-na-Gig <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) was
taken from an old church lately pulled down in the county Cavan, and is
now preserved in the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Dublin. The
third  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) was found at Ballinahend
Castle, also in

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the county of Tipperary; and the fourth <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) is preserved in the museum at Dublin, but
we are not informed from whence it was obtained. The next, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) which is also now preserved in the Dublin
Museum, was taken from the old church on the White Island, in Lough
Erne, county Fermanagh. This church is supposed by the Irish antiquaries
to be a structure of very great antiquity, for some of them would carry
its date as far back as the seventh century, but this is probably an
exaggeration. The one which follows  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) was furnished by an old church pulled
down by order of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and it was presented
to the museum at Dublin, by the late Dean Dawson. Our last example <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) was formerly in the possession of Sir
Benjamin Chapman, Bart., of Killoa Castle, Westmeath, and is now in a
private collection in London. It was found in 1859 at Chloran, in a
field on Sir Benjamin's estate known by the name of the "Old Town," from
whence stones had been removed at previous periods, though there are now
very small remains of building. This stone was found at a depth of about
five feet from the surface, which shows that the building, a church no
doubt,

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

must have fallen into ruin a long time ago. Contiguous to this field,
and at a distance of about two hundred yards from the spot where the
Shelah-na-Gig was found, there is an abandoned churchyard, separated
from the Old Town field only by a loose stone wall.

The belief in the salutary power of this image appears to be a
superstition of great antiquity, and to exist still among all peoples
who have not reached a certain degree of civilization. The universality
of this superstition leads us to think that Herodotus may have erred in
the explanation he has given of certain rather remarkable monuments of a
remote antiquity. He tells us that Sesostris, king of Egypt, raised
columns in some of the countries he conquered, on which he caused to be
figured the female organ of generation as a mark of contempt for those
who had submitted easily. <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) May not
these columns have been intended, if we knew the truth, as protections
for the people of the district in which they stood, and placed in the
position where they could most conveniently been seen? This
superstitious sentiment may also offer the true explanation of an
incident which is

PLATE VI  
SHELAH-NA-GIG MONUMENTS

 

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

said to have been represented in the mysteries of Eleusis. Ceres,
wandering over the earth in search of her daughter Proserpine, and
overcome with grief for her loss, arrived at the hut of an Athenian
peasant woman named Baubo, who received her hospitably, and offered her
to drink the refreshing mixture which the Greeks call Cyceon (κυκεων).
The goddess rejected the offered kindness, and refused all consolation.
Baubo, in her distress, bethought her of another expedient to allay the
grief of her guest. She relieved her sexual organs of that outward sign
which is the evidence of puberty, and then presented them to the view of
Ceres, who, at the sight, laughed, forgot her sorrows, and drank the
cyceon. <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) The prevailing belief in
the beneficial influence of this sight, rather than a mere pleasantry,
seems to afford the best explanation of this story.

This superstition which, as shown by the Shelah-na-Gigs of the Irish
churches, prevailed largely in the middle ages, explains another class
of antiquities which are not uncommon. These are small figures of nude
females exposing themselves in exactly the same

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

manner as in the sculptures on the churches in Ireland just alluded to.
Such figures are found not only among Roman, Greek, and Egyptian
antiquities, but among every people who had any knowledge of art, from
the aborigines of America to the far more civilized natives of Japan;
and it would be easy to give examples from almost every country we know,
but we confine ourselves to our more special part of the subject. In the
last century, a number of small statuettes in metal, in a rude but very
peculiar style of art, were found in the duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
in a part of Germany formerly occupied by the Vandals, and by the tribe
of the Obotrites, considered as a division of the Vendes. They appeared
to be intended to represent some of the deities worshipped by the people
who made them; and some of them bore inscriptions, one of which was in
Runic characters. From this circumstance we should presume that they
belonged to a period not much, if any, older than the fall of the
Western Empire. Some time afterwards, a few statuettes in metal were
found in the island of Sardinia, so exactly similar to those just
mentioned, that D'Hancarville, who published an account of them with
engravings, considered himself justified in ascribing them to the
Vandals, who occupied that island, as well as the tract of Germany

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

alluded to. <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) One of these images,
which D'Hancarville considers to be the Venus of the Vandal mythology,
represents a female in a reclining position, with the wings and claws of
a bird, holding to view a pomegranate, open, which, as D'Hancarville
remarks, was considered as a sign representing the female sexual organ.
In fact, it was a form and idea more unequivocally represented in the
Roman figures which we have already described, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) but which continued through the middle
ages, and was preserved in a popular name for that organ, *abricot*, or
expressed more energetically, *abricot fendu*, used by Rabelais, and we
believe still preserved in France. This curious image is represented,
after D'Hancarville, in three different points of view, in our
plate. <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) Several figures of a similar
description, but representing the subject in a more matter-of-fact
shape, were brought from Egypt by a Frenchman who held an official
situation in that country, and three of them are now in a private
collection in London. We have engraved one of these small bronzes, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) which, as will be seen, presents in exact
counterpart of the Shelah-na-Gig.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

These Egyptian images belonged no doubt to the Roman period. Another
similar figure, <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) made of lead, and
apparently mediæval, was found at Avignon, and is preserved in the same
private collection just alluded to; and a third, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) was dug up, about ten years ago, at
Kingston-on-Thames. The form of these statuettes seems to show that they
were intended as portable images, for the same purpose as the Shelahs,
which people might have ready at hand to look upon for protection
whenever they were under fear of the influence of the evil eye, or of
any other sort of enchantment.

We have not as yet any clear evidence of the existence of the
Shelah-na-Gig in churches out of Ireland. We have been informed that an
example has been found in one of the little churches on the coast of
Devon; and there are curious sculptures, which appear to be of the same
character, among the architectural ornamentation of the very early
church of San Fedele at Como in Italy. Three of these are engraved in
our [plate VIII](wgp04.htm#img_pl08.md). On the top of the right hand jamb
of the door  <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) is a naked male
figure, and in the same position on the other side a female, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md)

PLATE VII  
VENUS OF THE VANDALS, BRONZE AND LEAD IMAGES, AND CAPITAL OF A COLUMN

 

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

which are described to us as representing Adam and Eve, and our
informant, to whom we owe the drawings describes that at the apex  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) merely as "the figure of a woman holding
her legs apart." We understand that the surface of the stone in these
sculptures is so much worn that it is quite uncertain whether the sexual
parts were ever distinctly marked, but from the postures and positions
of the hands, and the situation in which these figures are placed, they
seem to resemble closely, except in their superior style of art, the
Shelah-na-Gigs of Ireland. There can be little doubt that the
superstition to which these objects belonged gave rise to much of the
indecent sculpture which is so often found upon mediæval ecclesiastical
buildings. The late Baron von Hammer-Pürgstall published a very learned
paper upon monuments of various kinds which he considered as
illustrating the secret history of the order of the Templars, from which
we learn that there was in his time a series of most extraordinary
obscene sculptures in the church of Schoengraber in Austria, of which he
intended to give engravings, but the drawings had not arrived in time
for his book; <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) but he has engraved
the capital of a column in the church of

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Egra, a town of Bohemia, of which we give a
copy, <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) in which the two sexes are
displaying to view the members, which were believed to be so efficatious
against the power of fascination.

The figure of the female organ, as well as the male, appears to have
been employed during the middle ages of Western Europe far more
generally than we might suppose, placed upon buildings as a talisman
against evil influences, and especially against witchcraft and the evil
eye, and it was used for this purpose in many other parts of the world.
It was the universal practice among the Arabs of Northern Africa to
stick up over the door of the house or tent, or put up nailed on a board
in some other way, the generative organ of a cow, mare, or female camel,
as a talisman to avert the influence of the evil eye. It is evident that
the figure of this member was far more liable to degradation in form
than that of the male, because it was much less easy, in the hands of
rude draughtsmen, to delineate in an intelligible form, and hence it
soon assumed shapes which though intended to represent it, we might
rather call symbolical of it, though no symbolism was intended. Thus the
figure of the female organ easily assumed the rude form of a horseshoe,
and as the original

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

meaning was forgotten, would be readily taken for that object, and a
real horseshoe nailed up for the same purpose. In this way originated,
apparently, from the popular worship of the generative powers, the
vulgar practice of nailing a horseshoe upon buildings to protect them
and all they contain against the power of witchcraft, a practice which
continues to exist among the peasantry in some parts of England at the
present day. Other marks are found, sometimes among the architectural
ornaments, such as certain triangles and triple loops, which are perhaps
typical forms of the same object. We have been informed that there is an
old church in Ireland where the male organ is drawn on one side of the
door, and the Shelah-na-Gig on the other, and that, though perhaps
comparatively modern, their import as protective charms are well
understood. We can easily imagine men, under the influence of these
superstitions, when they were obliged to halt for a moment by the side
of a building, drawing upon it such a figure, with the design that it
should be a protection to themselves, and thus probably we derive from
superstitious feelings the common propensity to draw phallic figures on
the sides of vacant walls and in other places.
