The ancient Roman and Greek cultures had a very different attitude about
sexuality than successive European cultures, more akin to that of the
[Kama Sutra](../kama/index). This, of course, was unimaginable to latter
day Europeans, who rigidly compartmentalized body, mind and spirit, and
to whom any sexuality was sinful and morbid.

Some of the best artistic expressions of this can be found in the
recovered city of Pompeii. Pompeii was frozen in time by the volcanic
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D., and not unearthed until 1748. Pompeii
was a seaside resort, devoted to the arts, relaxation, and the pursuit
of pleasure. The excavators were horrified to discover erotic frescos,
mosaics, statuary and phallic votive objects. The moveable erotic
artifacts were taken to Naples and kept in seclusion in the Royal
Museum. The erotic wall and floor art had lockable metal boxes
constructed over them and were displayed to tourists for an extra fee
(women and children excluded). When I visited Pompeii in the late 1960s,
this peepshow was still in operation.

This work is a translation of a book by a 19th Century French
antiquarian César Famin. In 1816 (according to a citation in the Library
of Congress catalog) he published (under the initials M. C. F.) Musée
royal de Naples; peintures, bronzes et statues érotiques du cabinet
secret, avec leur explication containing sixty lithographs of the best
erotic artifacts in the Naples collection. The name of the artist is
unknown. The volume was published with the cooperation of the Naples
museum in a very limited edition. The French authorities confiscated and
destroyed most known copies of the original book. One ended up in the
'Private Case' of the British Museum. There is also a copy in the
Special Collections of the Library of Congress.

In 1871, an English translation of Famin's work was published in England
under the byline of 'Colonel Fanin'. Privately printed in a limited
edition, this translation became one of the rarest erotic books. A
photographic reprint of this was published in 1969 in paperback by
'Collectors Publications' (City of Industry, CA), under the title The
Secret Erotic Paintings. Collectors Publications was a fly-by-night pulp
publisher whose line consisted mostly of stroke books, 'marriage'
manuals, pirate editions of Grove Press books, and a few reprints of
rare erotic books. The 1969 paperback edition, with atrocious color
separations, was the source of this etext and the accompanying images.
Originally priced at $15 (an astronomical price for a poorly printed 150
page paperback at the time--a more typical price was 50 cents), used
copies of this run up to $50 on the Internet.

Famin's text to accompany the images is deeply conflicted. He is
obviously drawn to the subject matter and has a deep understanding of
the significance of the artifacts. He also takes every opportunity to
condemn Classical sexual practices and cultural values. Whether this is
a figleaf or a sincere reaction is impossible to determine. However, in
spite of the 'shocked, shocked' attitude in Famin's text, it contains
quite a bit of valid and well-researched information, including quotes
from classical authors and details of mythology, artistic methods,
spiritual practices, architecture, and literature.

These pictures are fairly explicit and aren't for everyone. Few of the
items on display here are excessively purient by contemporary standards.
These are historical cultural artifacts, not pornography. Nonetheless,
consider yourself warned.
