# Votive Phalli.

BRONZES FROM HERCULANEUM.

PLATE XXVIII.

FIGURES 1 AND 2.

THE first two figures represent amulets divided into two parts, one of
which is in the form of a phallus, and the other of an arm with a hand,
making the *figue*, that obscene gesture which we have spoken of in
describing plate 19.

FIGURE 3.

This singular figure, to which are suspended four little bells, in its
wings and head resembles a bird, and in the hinder part a lion: a
threefold symbol of the generative principle, which fights with the
strength of a lion, propagates with the swiftness of an eagle, and
triumphs over all obstacles.

|           |            |
|-----------|------------|
| The lion  | Strength.  |
| The eagle | Swiftness. |
| The bells | Triumph.   |
