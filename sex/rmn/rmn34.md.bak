# A Satyr and a Bacchante.

PLATE XXXIII.

A BACCHANT crowned with ivy has chosen a solitary place to rest herself;
but the tambour which we see near her seems to indicate that she wished
her retreat to be no secret mystery to the inhabitants of these
solitudes. She reclines voluptuously; her beautiful head is artfully
turned aside; but her half-shut eyes show that she only feigns to be
asleep in order the better to favour the attempts of which she is about
to be the object. And indeed one satyr, attracted no doubt by the sound
of the music, approaches, and, judging by the apparent slumber of the
nymph that the moment is favourable, boldly lifts up the veil which
covered her beauty. His lascivious looks, his gaping nostrils, his
attitude and gestures, all indicate admiration and desire.
