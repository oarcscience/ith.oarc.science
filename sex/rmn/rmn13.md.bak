# Drillopota.

TERRA COTTA. *Height, 16 5/25 inches*.

PLATE XII.

BEHIND this figure is seen a vessel, which represents one of those
obscene vases called *Drillopotæ*, <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)
out of which the ancients were wont to drink on certain occasions,
undoubtedly in honour of Venus, or perhaps of Bacchus; for, assuredly it
would be difficult to suppose anything like dignity or seriousness in
such ceremonies. For a long time the corruption of the antique nations
led them to feign a disgraceful attachment for the immodest ceremonies
to which they were no longer able to yield a sincere worship.

This dwarf holds two objects in his hand which it would be difficult to
qualify--two lumps of bread, perhaps. He carries in his belt a sort of
casket, which may be the *crepundia*, a small box or purse for children
to keep their toys in.

This *Drillopota* comes from Civita.
