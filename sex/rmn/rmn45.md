PLATE XLIV.

THIS fresco, found at Pompeii, is unquestionably, as regards merit of
execution, one of the most remarkable of them all. We stated in our
Introduction that obscene paintings entered at Rome into the domain of
second-rate painters; but, making allowance for the decline of the art,
it cannot be doubted that the author of this fresco must have been a
very skilful artist for his time. Contrary to usage, we here find some
expression in the features of the two actors: their attitude has nothing
trivial; it has that natural character stripped of dignity which strikes
and humiliates us, even at the moment when our imagination is fascinated
by amorous desires. As is usual with natives of the South, the
flesh-tints of the hero of this scene are of a very decided brown. The
right arm of the woman, resting on her haunch, doubtless leaves
something to be desired; but it is a foreshortening--a rock against
which more than one modern painter has split.

A mere glance at this plate suffices us to guess the subject of it; and
indeed it would be rather difficult to explain it in sober language.
