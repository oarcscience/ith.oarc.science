# Votive Phallus.

Height about 5½ inches.

PLATE XXIV.

THIS curious bronze, from the Borgia museum, represents a votive phallus
under the form of a winged lion, bearing two other phalluses, of which
one, serves as a tail. The hind part is terminated by two feet, one of
which is lifted to the belly. On the back of the bronze we remark a
ring, which was used to suspend it. We have also on this phallus four
little bells attached to the same number of small chains.

We have here the symbols of force, rapidity, and triumph, which were
characteristic among the ancients of the worship of the phallus. The
same attributes belonged to certain other divinities, whose worship
consisted chiefly in mysterious and symbolical practices: such were
Bacchus, the Sun, Apollo, Osiris, so often and perhaps so justly
confounded, Eros, Vesta, the Eleusinian Ceres, &c.! Such was also the
god Mythra, for this divinity was no other than that of Eleusis. <span

We are indebted for some curious notions concerning the worship of
Mythra to the important researches of M. Felix Lajard and of M. von
Hammer. We will take this opportunity to give a few details respecting
the god Mythra, for the origin of his worship, and of those we have
mentioned above--however different they may appear--unite in the one
principle of *generation*.

According to Herodotus, Mythra is no other than the celestial Venus, or
Love, the principle of generation and fecundity. In several eastern
dialects Mythra signifies both *light* and *love*. The Persians received
this worship from the Indians, and transmitted it to the people of
Cilicia. Plutarch informs us that some pirates from that coast
introduced it into Rome sixty-eight years before Christ.

According to Von Hammer, Mythra was not the Sun itself, but he was the
genius of it, the *ized*. The name of this genius, which the Greeks
wrote Mythras, is Mihr, and this word, adds the learned Orientalist,
still signifies in modern Persian the *ized*, the sun, and love.

The worship of Mythra was free from the orgies which sullied at Rome
even that of Isis and Eleusis.

"The mysteries of Mythra," says Von Hammer, "like the mysteries of
Eleusis and others, afforded paganism a last retreat, in which it took
shelter to defend itself against the ever-growing power of the Christian
religion. The most enlightened and skilful defenders of paganism opposed
to the Christian doctrine the mysteries of Isis and Eleusis, and
especially those of Mythra, as a religious system superior to
Christianity, of which the latter contained in their opinion only false
or partial revelations; the mysteries of Mythra were, in this respect,
infinitely superior weapons to those of the other mysteries, since they
were connected immediately with the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

religion of Zoroaster, which in so many points presents the nearest
approach to the dogmas and rites of Christianity."

"The resemblance between the practices and ceremonies of the mysteries
of Mythra and those of the Christian religion is admitted by the fathers
of the Church, such as Justin and Tertullian; and the manner in which
others, such as Gregory of Nazianzen and Jerome, expressed themselves
concerning the mysteries of Mythra, sufficiently shows the importance
they attached to this rivalry of practices and ceremonies. The
establishment of Christianity was therefore doubtless one of the
principal causes -of the success and development of the worship of
Mythra in the Roman empire, until it succumbed before the triumph of the
Christian religion."

We see, then, from the above remarks, that the religion of Zoroaster, of
which the Zendavesta, the living fire, is the Bible, gave birth to the
mysteries of Mythra and to the ceremonies of Christianity; but in the
latter case the rites have been sanctified, and, after the example of
Tertullian and Saint Augustine, the admission may fearlessly be made.

Returning now to the plate which forms the subject of this explanation,
we would remark that this figure has a direct relation with Mythra, the
emblem and the genius of the Sun. An eagle and a lion, the Sun darts
forth from the East, bears down all obstacles, hovers under the vault of
the heavens, and descends to the horizon again, after receiving the
homage of men. With the Egyptians the griffin was the emblem of the Sun
and of Osiris.

Thus the fecundating principle is the divinity that presides over all
the forms of worship in antiquity, so often modified according to the
genius and the passions of the legislators who are so numerous in
Eastern annals.

If Love was adored as the principle of generation, Mythra was also
worshipped for the same reason: and indeed Porphyry calls him Demiurgus,
the maker of peoples, the lord of generation.
