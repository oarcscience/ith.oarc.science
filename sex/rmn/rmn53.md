FRESCO FROM POMPEII.

PLATE LII.

THIS erotic scene is remarkable for the presence of the cubicular slave,
a beautiful youth, who brings to the married pair a drinking-vessel,
probably containing a comforting liquor, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) turning his head aside as he presents it
to them, as if he blushed at their nakedness; with the same hand that
holds the vessel he raises two fingers, a gesture which in our own day
we should call *the cuckold's sign*, but which was not in ancient times
a mark of insult or derision. It was simply a gesture to which was
attributed the virtue of driving away witchcraft; and, as we said
before, this superstition still exists in Italy. Possibly the young

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

slave is desirous of keeping off the evil influences which might preside
over the act of which he is a witness, and which will some day give him
a new master.

The drawing of these figures is rather incorrect, and the expression
cold.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_54"></span>[103:1](rmn53.htm#fr_54.md) In their parties of
debauchery, the ancients took great delight in drinking water heated to
a certain temperature, in which it is very probable they mixed some
agreeable aphrodisiac to awaken sensuality. It is supposed also that
they used hot water internally as a remedy tending to refresh them, and
to restore to them part of the strength they had abused. SENEC., *Wal.
quæst.*, lib. III. p. 24; FREINSHERNINUS, *de Calid. Potion*, c. i. § 1
and 2"--(J. B. LEVEE, Notes, *Arch. sur le Curculion de Plauti*.)
