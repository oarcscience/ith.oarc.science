# A Votive Phallus.

Of the size of the original.

PLATE XXII.

ONE of these symbolical figures to which the ancients ascribed the
property of keeping off evil is shown here. They suspended them at the,
entrance of shops, under the peristyles of houses, in bedrooms, or in
the *venereum*. Sometimes these bronzes were used as lamps.

A gladiator covered with complete armour, his right hand grasping curved
sword, appears to be endeavouring to entrap his enemy in a net which
envelops his left hand; this was the manner of fighting with he
gladiators called *retiarii*. His adversary is a furious animal,
resembling a dog or a hyena, whose head serves as a crown to the
enormous phallus of our gladiator. It is evidently an image of the
combat which the strong and wise man wages with his warring senses.

To this figure are suspended five little bells. We have said in out
Introduction that these instruments were considered as talismans against
evil. But here they can only serve as a symbol of the triumph which the
gladiator is about to obtain. We know indeed that the ancients, and
especially the Romans, compelled the conquered and the slaves who
followed the car of the conqueror to carry little bells, which the
Latins called *tintinnabula*.
