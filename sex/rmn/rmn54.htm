<P>THE subject of this fresco is as ridiculous as the drawing is incorrect. How could a man, whom it is not possible to confound with a rural divinity, be thus in the open fields, in a complete state of nudity? or would he have dreamt, in such a place, of putting his mistress in the state, by removing her single garment? In this painting probability receives too great a shock, added to which the woman is twisting her neck in a horrible fashion to receive her lover's kisses.</P>
<P>These kind of obscene paintings (<I>Spinthri&aelig;</I>) are frequently referred to by Latin authors. Here are two examples taken at random:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The hand that first in naked colours traced<BR>
Groups of loose lovers on walls that once were chaste<BR>
And full exposed, broad burning on the light<BR>
The shapes and postures that abash the sight<BR>
Made artless minds in crime's refinements wise,<BR>
And flash'd enlightening vice on virgin eyes."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P></DIR>
