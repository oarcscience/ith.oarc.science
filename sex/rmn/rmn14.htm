PLATE XIII</P>

<P><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></P>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Drillopota.</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TERRA COTTA. <I>Height, 16 16/25 inches</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLATE XIII.</P>
<P>LIKE the former, this is another specimen of the <I>drillopot&aelig;</I>, representing a dwarf, a child's body with the head of an old man. Its figure is as much out of proportion as its attitude is obscene and yet its gestures seem too indicate modesty.</P>
<P>Sometimes the ancients made use of certain <I>drillopot&aelig;</I>, made of glass these were called <I>phallovitroboli</I>, or <I>phalloveretroboli</I>, drinking-glasses in the form of phalluses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Juvenal says: "He drinks from a Priapeian glass;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and the commentator adds: "Glass <A HREF="errata.htm#2">phalluses</A> called <I>drillopot&aelig;</I>."</P>
<P>The present vase is seen full and side-face; it will be remarked that the upper part has no opening, whence it appears that the vessel was turned upside down and filled at the bottom; it is probable that they drank from he projecting part as from a spout. <I>O tempora</I>!!</P>
<P>Many other <I>drillopot&aelig;</I> have been found at Civita, Herculaneum, and several parts of Magna Grecia; but as they are not in any way different from those we have described, we have deemed it useless to repeat a description of them.</P>
