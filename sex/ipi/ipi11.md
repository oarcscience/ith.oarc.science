# PHALLISM IN THE MODERN RELIGIONS.

In bringing this paper to a close, I would refer shortly to what may be
called the modern religions--Brahminism, Buddhism, and
Christianity--seeing that these still exist as the faiths of great
peoples. As to the first of these, it may be thought that its real
character cannot be ascertained from the present condition of Hindu
belief. It is said that the religion ofthe Vedas is very different from
that of the Puranas, which have taken their place. It should be
remembered, however, that these books profess to reproduce old doctrine,
the word "Purana" itself meaning old, and that Puranas are referred to
in one of the Upanishads, while the Tantras, which contain the
principles of the Sacti Puja, and which are, as yet, almost unknown to
Europeans, are considered by the Brahmans to be more ancient than the
Puranas themselves. <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](ipi14.htm#fn_132.md) The
origin of the ideas contained in these books is a difficult question.
The germs of both Vishnu-worship and Siva-worship appear to be found in
the Vedas, <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](ipi14.htm#fn_133.md) and are
undoubtedly referred to by the Mahabharata. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](ipi14.htm#fn_134.md) I am inclined to think with
Mr. Fergusson and other late writers that they are only indirectly
sprung from the primitive Hinduism. The similarity between Sivaism and
the Santal worship of the Great Mountain, pointed out by Mr. Hunter, is
very remarkable, and this analogy is strengthened by intermixture in
both cases with river-worship. <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](ipi14.htm#fn_135.md) There is no doubt that the
Great Mountain is simply a name for the phallic emblem, which is the
chief form under which Siva is represented in the numerous temples at
Benares dedicated to his honor.
