# THE SUN-GODS OF ANTIQUITY.

When considering the sacred bull of antiquity, the symbol of the
fecundating force in nature, I referred to Osiris the national sun-god
of the Egyptians, as distinguished from the Semitic Seth (Set), who was
identified with the detested Shepherd race. The association of Osiris
with Khem shows his phallic character, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](ipi14.htm#fn_107.md) and, in fact, Plutarch
asserts that he was everywhere represented with the phallus
exposed. <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](ipi14.htm#fn_108.md) The phallic
idea enters, moreover, into the character of all the chief Egyptian
deities. Bunsen says: "The mythological system obviously proceeded from
'the concealed god,' Ammon, to the creating god. The latter appears
first of all as the generative power of nature in the phallic god Khem,
who is afterwards merged in Ammon-ra. Then sprung up the idea of the
creative power in Kneph. He forms the divine limbs of Osiris (the
primeval Soul) in contradiction to Ptah, who, as the strictly demiurgic
principle, forms the visible world. Neith is the creative principle, as
nature represented under a feminine form. Finally, her son Ra, Helios,
appears as the last of the series, in the character of father and
nourisher of terrestrial things. It is he whom an ancient monument
represents as the demiurgic principle, creating the mundane egg." <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](ipi14.htm#fn_109.md) The name of Ammon has led to
the notion that he was the embodiment of the idea of wisdom. He
certainly was distinguished by having the human form, but his
hieroglyphical symbol of the obelisk, and his connection with Khem, show
his true nature. He undoubtedly represented the primitive idea of a
generative god, probably at a time when this notion of fecundity had not
yet been extended to nature as distinguished from man, and thus he would
form a point of contact between the later Egyptian sun-gods and the
pillar-gods of the Semites and Phoenicians. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](ipi14.htm#fn_110.md) To the Egyptians, as to these
other peoples, the sun became the great source of deity. His fecundating
warmth or his fiery destroying heat were, however, not the only
attributes deified. These were the most important, but the Egyptians,
especially, made gods out of many of the solar characters; <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](ipi14.htm#fn_111.md) although the association of
the idea of "intellect" with Ammon-ra must have been of late date, if
the original nature of Ammon be what I have suggested.

As man, however, began to read nature aright, and as his moral and
intellectual faculties were developed, it was necessary that the solar
deities themselves should become invested with co-relative attributes,
or that other gods should be formed to embody them. The perception of
light, as distinct from heat, was a fertile source of such attributes.
In the Chaldean mythology, Vul, the son of Anu, was the god of the air;
but his power had relation to the purely atmospheric phenomena rather
than to light. <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](ipi14.htm#fn_112.md) The only
reference to light I find in the titles of the early deities is in the
character ascribed to Va-Iua, the later Bar or Nin-ip, who is said to
irradiate the nations like the sun, the light of the gods. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](ipi14.htm#fn_113.md) But this deity was apparently
the distant planet Saturn, although it may have been originally the
moon, and I would refer to the Aryan mind the perception of light as a
divine attribute. <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](ipi14.htm#fn_114.md) Thus
the Hindu Dyaus (the Greek Zeus) is the shining deity--the god of the
bright sky. As such, the sun-gods now also become the gods of
intellectual wisdom, an attribute which likewise appears to have
originated with the Aryan peoples, amongst whom the Brahmans were the
possessors of the highest wisdom, as children of the sun, and whose
Apollo and Athene were noble embodiments of this attribute. The Chaldean
gods Hea and Nebo were undoubtedly symbolized by the wedge or
arrow-head, which had especial reference to learning. In reality,
however, this symbol merely shows that they were the patrons of letters
or writing, and not of "wisdom," in its purely intellectual aspect. If
the form of the Assyrian alphabetical character was of phallic
origin, <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](ipi14.htm#fn_115.md) we have here
the source of the idea of a connection between physical and mental
knowledge embodied in the legend of the "fall." In the Persian
Ahuro-Mazdao (the Wise Spirit) we have the purest representation of
intellectual wisdom. The book of Zoroaster, the Avesta, is literally the
"Word"--the word or wisdom which was revealed in creation, and embodied
in the divine Mithra, who was himself the luminous sun-god.
