# HERMAE, TERMINI, PILLARS AND "GROVES."

One of the primeval gods of antiquity was Hermes, the Syro-Egyptian
Thoth, and the Roman Mercury. Kircher identifies him also with the god
Terminus. This is doubtless true, as Hermes was a god of boundaries, and
appears, as Dulaure has well shown, to have presided over the national
frontiers. The meaning of the word Thoth, erecting, associates it with
this fact. The peculiar primitive form of Mercury, or Hermes, was "a
large stone, frequently square, and without either hands or feet.
Sometimes the triangular shape was preferred, sometimes an upright
pillar, and sometimes a heap of rude stones." <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](ipi14.htm#fn_53.md) The pillars were called by the
Greeks Hermae, and the heaps were known as Hermean heaps--the latter
being accumulated "by the custom of each passenger throwing a stone to
the daily increasing mass, in honor of the god. Sometimes the pillar was
represented with the attributes of Priapus. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](ipi14.htm#fn_54.md)

The identification of Hermes or Mercury with Priapus is confirmed by the
offices which the latter deity fulfilled. One of the most important was
that of protector of gardens and orchards, and probably this was the
original office performed by Hermes in his character of a "god of the
country." <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](ipi14.htm#fn_55.md) Figures set up
as charms to protect the produce of the ground would, in course of time,
be used not only for this purpose, but also to mark the boundaries of
the land protected, and these offices being divided, two deities would
finally be formed out of one. The Greek Hermes was connected also with
the Egyptian Khem, and no less, if we may judge from the symbols used in
his worship, with the Hebrew EIoah. This, in the history of the Hebrew
patriarchs, we are told that when Jacob entered into a covenant with his
father-in-law Laban, a pillar was set up, and a heap of stones
made, <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](ipi14.htm#fn_56.md) and Laban said to
Jacob, "Behold this heap and behold this pillar, which I have cast
betwixt me and thee; this heap be witness, and this pillar be witness,
that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shall not
pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm." We have here the
Hermae and Hermean heap, used by the Greeks as landmarks, and placed by
them on the public roads.

In the Iinga of India we have another instance of the use of the
pillar-symbol. The form of this symbol is sufficiently expressive of the
idea which it embodies--an idea which is more explicitly shown when the
Linga and the Yoni are, as is usually the case among the worshippers of
the Hindu Siva, combined to form the Lingam. The stone figure is not,
however, itself a god, but only representative of a spirit <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](ipi14.htm#fn_57.md) who is thought to be able to
satisfy the yearning for children so characteristic of many primitive
peoples this probably having been its original object, and the source of
its use as an amulet for the protection of children against the
influence of the evil eye. In course of time, however, when other
property came to be coveted equally with offspring, the power to give
this property would naturally be referred to the primitive phallic
spirit, and hence he became, not merely the protector, as we have seen,
of the produce of the fields and the guardian of boundaries, but also
the god of wealth and traffic, and even the patron of thieves, as was
the case with the Mercury of the Romans.

The Hebrew patriarchs desired large flocks as well as numerous
descendants, and hence the symbolical pillar was peculiarly fitted for
their religious rites. It is related even of Abraham, the traditional
founder of the Hebrew people, that he "planted a grove (eshel) <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](ipi14.htm#fn_58.md) in Beersheba, and called there
on the name of Jehovah, the everlasting Elohim." <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](ipi14.htm#fn_59.md) From the phallic character of
the "grove" (ashera,) said to have been in the House of Jehovah, and
from the evident connection between the two words, we must suppose that
the eshel of Abraham also had a phallic reference. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](ipi14.htm#fn_60.md) Most probably the so-called
"grove " of the earlier patriarch, though it may have been of wood, and
the stone "bethel" of Jacob, had the same form, and were simply the
betylus, <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](ipi14.htm#fn_61.md) the primitive
symbol of deity among all Semitic and many Hamitic peoples.

The participation of the Hebrew patriarchs in the rites connected with
the "pillar-worship" of the ancient world, renders it extremely probable
that they were not strangers to the later planetary worship. Many of the
old phallic symbols were associated with the new superstition; and
Abraham, being a Chaldean, it is natural to suppose that he was one of
its adherents. Tradition, indeed, affirms that Abraham was a great
astronomer, and, at one time at least, a worshipper of the heavenly
bodies--and that he and the other patriarchs continued to be affected by
this superstition is shown by various incidents related in the
Pentateuch. Thus, in the description given of the sacrificial covenant
between Abraham and Jehovah, it is said that, after Abraham had divided
the sacrificial animals, a deep sleep fell upon him as the sun was going
down, and Jehovah spoke with him. "Then, when the sun went down, and it
was dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed
between those pieces." The happening of this event at the moment of the
sun's setting reminds us of the Sabaean custom of praying to the setting
sun, still practiced, according to Palgrave, among the nomads of Central
Arabia.
