# THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL.

Another feature of the Mosaic legend of the "fall" which deserves
consideration is the reference to the tree of knowledge, or wisdom. It
is now generally supposed that the forbidden fruit was a kind of citrus,
 <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](ipi14.htm#fn_28.md) but certain facts
connected with arborolatry seem to me to disprove this opinion. Among
peoples in the most opposite regions various species of the fig-tree are
held sacred. Thus it is, throughout nearly the whole of Africa, with the
banyan (Ficus indicus), the sacred tree of the Hindu Brahmins. Even in
several of the Polynesian islands, as in various parts of the Indian
Archipelago and in Northern Australia, the fig-tree is highly venerated.
In ancient Egypt, the banyan, or the Ficus sycamorus, was always
considered sacred. <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](ipi14.htm#fn_29.md) So it
was in Greece and Italy. According to Plutarch, a basket of figs formed
one of the chief objects carried in the procession in honor of
Bacchus--and the sacred phallus itself appears to have been made of the
wood of the fig-tree, as was also the statue of the phallic god
Priapus. <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](ipi14.htm#fn_30.md)

Judging from these facts, and considering that the sycamore was sacred
among the Hebrews themselves--its fruit having the significance of the
virgin womb <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](ipi14.htm#fn_31.md)--there can be
little difficulty in identifying the fig-tree, whether the sycamore or
the banyan, with the tree of knowledge planted in the midst of the
garden of Eden. The sense intended to be conveyed by this expression
would be evident enough without the introduction of the "tree of life."
That this is intended to represent the male element is undoubted. The
Chaldean god Hea, who was symbolized by the serpent, was also the god of
life and knowledge; and RawIinson states that "there are very strong
grounds indeed for connecting him with the serpent of scripture, and
with the Paradisiacal traditions of the tree of knowledge and the tree
of life." <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](ipi14.htm#fn_32.md) The bo-tree
(Ficus religiosa) of the Buddhists is said to derive greater sacredness
from its encircling the palm--the Palmyra palm being the kalpa-tree, or
the "tree of life" of the Hindu paradise. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](ipi14.htm#fn_33.md) This connection is termed by the
Buddhists "the bo-tree united in marriage with the palm," and we have in
it the perfect idea of generative activity, the combination of the male
and female elements. Mr. Fergusson, in accordance with his special
theory as to the origin of serpent-worship, thinks that this
superstition characterized the old Turanian (by which probably he means
Hamitic) empire of Chaldea, while tree-worship was more characteristic
of the later Assyrian empire. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](ipi14.htm#fn_34.md) This opinion is, no doubt,
correct; and it means really that the older race had that form of faith
with which the serpent was always indirectly connected--adoration of the
male principle of generation, the primitive phase of which was probably
ancestor-worship; while the latter race adored the female principle,
symbolized by the sacred tree, the Assyrian "grove." The "tree of life,"
however, undoubtedly had reference to the male element, and we may well
suppose that originally the fruit alone was treated as symbolical of the
opposite principle. <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](ipi14.htm#fn_35.md)

There is still an important point connected with the Hebrew legend which
requires consideration--the nature of the protecting kerub. That this
was merely intended as a symbol of the deity himself, there is every
reason to believe, and that the symbol was nothing more than the sacred
bull of antiquity, is evident from the description of the kerub given by
Ezekiel (chaps. i. and x.). <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](ipi14.htm#fn_36.md) But what was the religious
significance of the bull, an animal which it would be easy to prove was
venerated by nearly all the peoples of antiquity? It is now well known
that the bull symbolized the productive force in nature, and hence it
was associated with the sun-gods. The symbolic figure carried in
procession during the festival of Osiris and Isis was representative,
probably, of the phallus of this animal. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](ipi14.htm#fn_37.md) According to the cosmogony of
the Zend-Avesta, Ormuzd, after he had created the heavens and the earth,
formed the first being, called by Zoroaster "the primeval bull." This
bull was poisoned by Ahriman; but its seed was carried, by the soul of
the dying animal, represented as an ized, to the moon, "where it is
continually purified and fecundated by the warmth and light of the sun,
to become the germ of all creatures." At the same time, the material
prototypes of all living things, including man himself, issued from the
body of the bull. <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](ipi14.htm#fn_38.md) This is
but a developed form of the ideas which anciently were almost
universally associated with this animal among those peoples who were
addicted to sun-worship. There is no doubt, however, that the
superstitious veneration for the bull existed, as it still exists, quite
independently of the worship of the heavenly bodies. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](ipi14.htm#fn_39.md) The bull, like the goat, must
have been a sacred animal in Egypt before it was declared to be an
embodiment of the sun-god Osiris. In some sense, indeed, the bull and
the serpent, although both of them became associated with the solar
deities, were antagonistic. The serpent was symbolical of the personal
male element, or rather had especial reference to the life of man, <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](ipi14.htm#fn_40.md) while the bull had relation to
nature as a whole, and was symbolical of the idea of fecundity. This
antagonism was brought to an issue in the struggle between Osiris and
Seti (Seth), which ended in the triumph of the god of nature, although
it was renewed even during the exodus, when the golden calf of Osiris,
or Horus, was set up in the Hebrew camp.

The references made to the serpent, to the tree of wisdom, and to the
bull in the legend of the "fall," sufficiently prove its phallic
character; which was, indeed, recognized in the early Christian
church. <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](ipi14.htm#fn_41.md) This view is
confirmed, moreover, by analogous legends in other mythologies. The
Hindu legend approaches very nearly to that preserved in the Hebrew
scriptures. Thus, it is said that Siva, as the Supreme Being, desired to
tempt Brahma (who had taken human form), and for this object he dropped
from heaven a blossom of the sacred fig-tree. Brahma, instigated by his
wife, Satarupa, endeavors to obtain this blossom, thinking its
possession will render him immortal and divine; but when he has
succeeded in doing so, he is cursed by Siva, and doomed to misery and
degradation. Mr. Hardwicke, when commenting on this tradition, adds that
the sacred Indian fig is endowed by the Brahmans and Buddhists with
mysterious significance, as the tree of knowledge or intelligence. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](ipi14.htm#fn_42.md) This legend confirms what I have
said as to the nature of the Hebrew tree of knowledge, and also the
phallic explanation of the "fall" itself, which we consider the
attributes of the tempter of the Hindu story. The Persian legend
preserved in the Boun-dehesch is, however, still more conclusive.
According to this legend Meschia and Meschiane, the first man and woman,
were seduced by Ahriman, under the form of a serpent, and they then
first committed "in thought, word, and action, the carnal sin, and thus
tainted with original sin all their descendants." <span
