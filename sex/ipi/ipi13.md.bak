# PHALLISM IN THE CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS.

In conclusion, it must be said that Christianity itself is certainly not
without the phallic element. Reference may be made to the important
place taken in Christian dogma by the "fall"--which I have shown to have
had a purely "phallic" foundation--and to the peculiar position assigned
to Mary, as the Virgin Mother of God. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](ipi14.htm#fn_160.md) It must not be forgotten,
however, that, whatever may have been the primitive idea on which these
dogmas are based, it had received a totally fresh aspect, at the hands
of those from whom the founders of Christianity received it. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](ipi14.htm#fn_161.md) As to symbols, too, these
were employed by the Christians in the later signification given to them
by the followers of the ancient faiths. Thus, the fish--and the
cross-symbols originally embodied the idea of generation, but afterwards
that of life, and it was in this sense that they were applied to
Christ. <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](ipi14.htm#fn_162.md) The most
evidently phallic representation used by the Christian iconographers is
undoubtedly the aureole or vessica. This was generally elliptical in
form, and contained the figure of Christ; Mary herself, however, being
sometimes represented in the aureole, glorified as Jesus Christ. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](ipi14.htm#fn_163.md) Probably the nimbus, also, is
of phallic significance; for, although generally circular, it was
sometimes triangular, square, etc. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](ipi14.htm#fn_164.md) The name of Jehovah is
inscribed within a radiating triaiigle. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](ipi14.htm#fn_165.md) Didron gives a representation
of St. John the Evangelist with a circular nimbus, surmounted by two
sunflowers, emblems of the sun, an idea which, says Didron, "reminds us
of the Egyptian figures, from the heads of which two lotus-flowers rise
in a similar manner." <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](ipi14.htm#fn_166.md)
There is also a curious representation, in this work, of the divine
hand, with the thumb and two forefingers outstretched, resting on a
cruciform nimbus (p. 215). In Egypt, the hand having the fingers thus
placed was a symbol of Isis, and from its accompaniments, there can be
little doubt, notwithstanding the mesmeric character ascribed to it by
Ennemoser, <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](ipi14.htm#fn_167.md) that it had
an essentially phallic origin, although it may ultimately have been used
to signify life.

There can be no question, however, that, whatever may be thought of its
symbols, <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](ipi14.htm#fn_168.md) the
fundemental basis of Christianity is more purely "phallic" than that of
any other religion now existing. I have referred to the presence in
Hebraic theology of an idea of God--that of a Father--antagonistic to
the Phoenician notion of the "Lord of Heaven." We have the same idea
repeated in Christ's teaching, its distinctive characteristic being the
recognition of God as the Universal Father, the Great Parent of Mankind,
who had sent His son into the world that he might reconcile it unto
Himself. It is in the character of a forgiving parent that Christians
are taught to view God, when He is not lost sight of in the presence of
Christ. The emotional nature of Christian faith, indeed, shows how
intimately it was related to the older faiths which had a phallic basis.
In Christianity, we see the final expression of the primitive worship of
the father as the head of the family, the generator, as the result of an
instinctive reasoning process leading up from the particular to the
universal, with which, however, the dogma of the "fall" and its
consequences--deduced so strangely from a phallic legend--have been
incorporated. The "phallic" is, indeed, the only foundation on which an
emotional religion can be based. As a religion of the emotions,
therefore, the position of Christianity is perfectly unassailable. As a
system of rational faith, however, it is far different; and the tendency
of the present age is just the reverse of that which took place among
the Hebrews--the substitution of a Heavenly King for a Divine Father. In
fact, modern science is doing its best to effect for primitive
fetishism, or demon-worship, what Christianity has done for phallic
worship--generalize the powers of nature and make of God a Great
Unknowable Being, who, like the Elohim of the Mosaic cosmogony, in some
mysterious manner, causes all things to appear at a word. This cannot
be, however, the real religion of the future. If God is to be worshipped
at all, the Heavenly King and Divine Father must be combined in a single
term; and he must be viewed, not as the unknowable cause of being, but
as the Great Source of all being, who may be known in nature--the
expression of his life and energy.
