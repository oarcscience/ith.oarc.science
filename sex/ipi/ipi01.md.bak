IT will not be necessary for me to give details of the rites by which
the phallic superstition is distinguished, as they may be found in the
works of Dulaure, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](ipi14.htm#fn_0.md) Payne
Knight, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](ipi14.htm#fn_1.md) and other writers. I
shall refer to them, therefore, only so far as may be required for the
due understanding of the subject to be considered--the influence of the
Phallic idea in the religions of antiquity. The first step in the
inquiry is to ascertain the origin of the superstition in question.
Faber ingeniously referred to a primitive universal belief in a great
father, the curious connection seen to exist between nearly all
non-Christian mythologies, and he saw in phallic worship a degradation
of this belief. Such an explanation as this is, however, not
satisfactory; since, not only does it require the assumption of a
primitive divine revelation, but proof is still wanting that all peoples
have, or ever had, any such notion of a great parent of mankind as that
supposed to have been revealed. And yet there is a valuable germ of
truth in this hypothesis. The phallic superstition is founded
essentially in the family idea. Captain Richard Burton recognized this
truth when he asserted that "amongst all barbarians whose primal want is
progeny, we observe a greater or less development of the phallic
worship." <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](ipi14.htm#fn_2.md) This view, however,
is imperfect. There must have been something more than a mere desire for
progeny to lead primitive man to view the generative process with the
peculiar feelings embodied in this superstition. We are, in fact, here
taken to the root of all religions--awe at the mysterious and unknown.
That which the uncultured mind cannot understand is viewed with dread or
veneration, as it may be, and the object presenting the mysterious
phenomenon may itself be worshipped as a fetish, or the residence of a
presiding spirit. But there is nothing more mysterious than the
phenomena of generation, and nothing more important than the final
result of the generative act. Reflection on this result would naturally
cause that which led to it to be invested with a certain degree of
superstitious significance. The feeling generated would have a double
object, as it had a double origin--wonder at the phenomenon itself and a
perception of the value of its consequences. The former, which is the
most simple, would lead to a veneration for the organs whose operation
conduced to the phenomena--hence the superstitious practices connected
with the phallus and the yoni among primitive peoples. In this,
moreover, we have the explanation of numerous curious facts observed
among eastern peoples. Such is the respect shown by women for the
generative organ of dervishes and fakirs. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](ipi14.htm#fn_3.md) Such also is the Semitic custom
referred to in the Hebrew Scriptures as "the putting of the hand under
the thigh," which is explained by the Talmudists to be the touching of
that part of the body which is sealed and made holy by circumcision: a
custom which was, up to a recent date, still in use among the Arabs as
the most solemn guarantee of truthfulness. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](ipi14.htm#fn_4.md)

The second phase of the phallic superstition is that which arises from a
perception of the value of the consequences of the act of generation.
The distinction between this and the preceding phase is that, while the
one has relation to the organs engaged, the other refers more
particularly to the chief agent. Thus, the father of the family is
venerated as the generator; this authority is founded altogether on the
act and consequences of generation. We thus see the fundamental
importance, as well as the phallic origin, of the family idea. From this
has sprung the social organization of all primitive peoples.

An instance in point may be derived from Mr. Hunter's account of the
Santals of Bengal. He says that the classification of this interesting
people among themselves depends, "not upon social rank or occupation,
but upon the family basis." This is shown by the character of the six
great ceremonies in a Santal's life, which are: "admission into the
family; admission into the tribe; admission into the race; union of his
own tribe with another by marriage; formal dismission from the living
race by incremation; lastly, a reunion with the departed fathers." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](ipi14.htm#fn_5.md)

We may judge from this of the character of certain customs which are
widespread among primitive peoples, and the phallic origin of which has
long been lost sight of. The value set on the results of the generative
act would naturally make the arrival at the age of puberty an event of
peculiar significance. Hence, we find various ceremonies performed among
primitive, and even among civilized, peoples at this period of life.
Often when the youth arrives at manhood other rites are performed to
mark the significance of the event.

Marriage, too, derives an importance from its consequences which
otherwise it would not possess. Thus, among many peoples it is attended
with certain ceremonies denoting its object, or, at least, marking it as
an event of peculiar significance in the life of the individual, or even
in the history of the tribe. The marriage ceremonial is especially
fitted for the use of phallic rites or symbolism; the former, among
semi-civilized peoples, often being simply the act of consummation
itself, which appears to be looked on as part of the ceremony. The
symbolism we have ourselves retained to the present day in the
wedding-ring, which must have had a phallic origin, if, as appears
probable, it originated in the Samothracian mysteries. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](ipi14.htm#fn_6.md) Nor does the influence of the
phallic idea end with life. The veneration entertained for the father of
the family as the "generator," led in time to peculiar care being taken
of the bodies of the dead; and, finally, to the worship of ancestors,
which, under one form or another, distinguished all the civilized
nations of antiquity, as it does even now most of the peoples of the
heathen world.
