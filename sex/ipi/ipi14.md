<span id="fn_3"></span>[4](ipi01.htm#fr_3.md) The Vanaprastha were
Brahminical anchorites, who inhabited the deserts, lived on vegetables,
devoted themselves to contemplation, macerated the body, fought with
devils and giants (as a natural consequence), and were insensible to
heat and cold. They were called later, by the Greeks, Gymnosophists; and
although they went perfectly naked, no throb or involuntary movement was
ever seen in any part of their bodies. Women who were barren oftentimes
came and touched their shrivelled member, hoping thereby to become
fruitful. Not the slightest emotion was noticed at such times.

The old ascetics would have regarded with contempt the practices of
Christian monks, who were indeed children when compared with their
Eastern ancestors.--The Monks before Christ, by John Edgar Johnson; and

nations cognate with the Egyptians and the Phoenicians. The neglect of
it by Moses and by the Israelites whom he conducted to the border of the
land of Canaan, is a strong presumption against its previous employment
by the patriarchs.--Ed.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[19](ipi03.htm#fr_18.md) I have a strong suspicion
that, in its primitive shape, the Hebrew legend, as that of the
Mexicans, gave the serpent-form to both the father and the mother of the
human race.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20](ipi03.htm#fr_19.md) Tree and Serpent Worship,
p. 46. Rudra, the Vedic form of Siva, the "King of Serpents," is called
the father of the maruts (winds). See infra as to identification of Siva
with Saturn.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21](ipi03.htm#fr_20.md) The idea of circularity
appears to be associated with both these names. See Bryant, op. cit.,

<span id="fn_39"></span>[40](ipi04.htm#fr_39.md) This superstition is found
among peoples--the Kafirs, for instance--who do not appear to possess
any trace of planetary worship.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[41](ipi04.htm#fr_40.md) This is evident from the
facts mentioned above, notwithstanding the use of this animal as a
symbol of wisdom.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](ipi04.htm#fr_41.md) In connection with this
subject, see St. Jerome, in his letter on Virginity to Eustochia.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[44](ipi04.htm#fr_43.md) Lajard, op. cit, pp.
52-60. The destruction of purity in the world by the Serpent Dahaka is
stated in the 9th Yacna, v. 27. We have probably here the germ of the
fuller legend, which may, however, have been contained in the lost
portion of the Zend-Avesta.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[45](ipi05.htm#fr_44.md) The turning of Aaron's rod
into a serpent had, no doubt, a reference to the idea of wisdom
associated with that animal.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[50](ipi05.htm#fr_49.md) Jehovah threatens death,
but the Serpent impliedly promises life, the former having relation to
the individual, the latter to the race.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[51](ipi05.htm#fr_50.md) Lajard, op. cit., p. 60,
note.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[52](ipi05.htm#fr_51.md) Several of the Essenes,
who appear to have had some connection with Mithraism, taught this
doctrine.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[53](ipi05.htm#fr_52.md) It is well known to
biblical critics that this legend formed no part of the earlier Mosaic
narrative.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[55](ipi06.htm#fr_54.md) See Dulaure, op. cit.,

<span id="fn_56"></span>[57](ipi06.htm#fr_56.md) Genesis xxxi. 45 to 53.
Jacob called the heap or cairn of stones Galeed, a circle, and the
statue Mizpeh, or a pillar.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[58](ipi06.htm#fr_57.md) Linga means a "sign" or
"token." The truth of the statement in the text would seem to follow,
moreover, from the fact, that the figure is sacred only after it has
undergone certain ceremonies at the hands of a priest.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59](ipi06.htm#fr_58.md) Said also to mean a
tamarisk tree. It is asserted to have been worshipped in subsequent
times.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](ipi06.htm#fr_59.md) Genesis xxi. 33.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[61](ipi06.htm#fr_60.md) Even if the statement of
this event be an interpolation, the argument in the text is not
affected. The statement sufficiently shows what was the form of worship
traditionally assigned to Abraham.

Baetylia, stones having souls"--lithous empsuchous).

<span id="fn_62"></span>[63](ipi07.htm#fr_62.md) May it not have been the
"Religious War" which is recorded as having taken place in the different
countries of the archaic period, from India to the remoter West?--Ed.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[64](ipi07.htm#fr_63.md) Rawlinson's Five Ancient
Monarchies, vol. i., p. 617; ii., p. 247.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[65](ipi07.htm#fr_64.md) The later Hebrews affected
the Persian religion, in which the Sun was the emblem of worship.
Abraham evidently had a like preference, being a reputed iconoclast. The
lunar religionists employed images in their worship.--Ed.

the Jews, Book i., chap. viii., § 2.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[67](ipi07.htm#fr_66.md) The serpent-symbol of the
exodus \[Numbers xxi.\] is called a "seraph."

<span id="fn_67"></span>[68](ipi07.htm#fr_67.md) Moses is set forth as the
son-in-law of Jethro or Hobab, the Kenite, a priest; and probably became
his disciple. At Horeb he learned, by a sacred vision, or initiation,
the sacred name. As the Kenites were scribes or hierophants (I
Chronicles ii. 55), it is very probable that they had the knowledge of
this name, in common with the Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and the sacerdotal
orders of other Asiatic nations.--Ed.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[69](ipi07.htm#fr_68.md) The ark was the depositum
of divine or generative power for the preservation of the human race.
The dove always accompanies it.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[70](ipi07.htm#fr_69.md) The History of Israel
(English translation), vol. i., p. 532.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[71](ipi07.htm#fr_70.md) See Sanchoniathon (Cory,
op.cit.)

<span id="fn_71"></span>[72](ipi08.htm#fr_71.md) "But for the foolish
devices of their wickedness, wherewith being deceived, they worshipped
serpents void of reason, and vile beasts, thou didst send a multitude of
irrational beasts upon them for vengeance, that they might know that
wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be
condemned."--Wisdom of Solomon, xi. 16.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](ipi08.htm#fr_72.md) Much discussion has taken
place as to the nature of these animals. For an explanation of the
epithet "fiery," see Sanchoniathon, "Of the Serpent" (Cory, op. cit.).

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](ipi08.htm#fr_73.md) Numbers xxi. 8, 9.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](ipi08.htm#fr_74.md) "Having come to the
interior of the desert, the people were exposed to the attacks of
Burning Serpents, as the original text reads, the bite of which caused
great pain; and not a few of the sufferers died, which again produced an
immense excitement in the camp. Moses was ordered to ressort to the
means of the Phoenician Esculapius, whose symbol, the brass serpent, was
erected in the camp, which produced the desired effect."--History of the
Israelitish Nation, by Isaac M. Wise, p. 102.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[82](ipi08.htm#fr_81.md) As to the God Seth, see
Pleyte, La Religion des Pre-Israelites (1862).

<span id="fn_82"></span>[83](ipi08.htm#fr_82.md) The Sanscrit, Maha vuse, a
great sage, seems to be a plausible etymology. Musa as it is pronounced,
is the Arabic name; and it may have an affinity with the Muses of
Thessaly and the ancient sage Musaeus.--Ed.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[84](ipi08.htm#fr_83.md) According to Pleyte, the
Cabalists thought that the soul of Seth had passed into Moses (op. cit.,
p. 124). It is strange that the name of the Egyptian princess who is
said to have brought up Moses is given by Josephus as Thermuthis, this
being the name of the sacred asp of Egypt (see supra). We appear, also,
to have a reference to the serpent in the name Levi, one of the sons of
Jacob, from whom the descent of Moses was traced.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[93](ipi08.htm#fr_92.md) The Brazen Serpent made by

<span id="fn_103"></span>[104](ipi08.htm#fr_103.md) It has been suggested
that the ram was introduced as an astrological symbol. By the precession
of the equinoxes, the sign Aries became the emblem of the Sun, as the
genitor of the new year, and so a proper effigy of the Deity. The
appearance of the lamb or ram would, of course, create confusion and
misapprehension, as well as controversy among those who did not
understand astronomy.--Ed.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[115](ipi09.htm#fr_114.md) Mau, the name of the
Egyptian God of Truth, certainly signifies "light" but probably only in
a figurative sense.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](ipi09.htm#fr_115.md) The importance ascribed
to the mechanical arts may, perhaps, lead us to look for the formal
origin of this character in the "wedge," which was the chief mechanical
power the ancients possessed.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[118](ipi10.htm#fr_117.md) Bryant, in his Ancient
Mythology, has brought together a great mass of materials bearing on
this question. The facts, however, are capable of quite a different
interpretation from that which he has given to them.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[120](ipi10.htm#fr_119.md) Compare this with the
figuurative description of the garden of delights of "The Song of
Songs."

<span id="fn_120"></span>[121](ipi10.htm#fr_120.md) The Hebrew term GN, or
garden, appears to be closely related to the Greek word gune, or woman.
Indeed, in the ancient languages the former is used as a metaphor for
the latter. See Inman's Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names, vol.
i., p. 52; vol. ii., p. 553.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[124](ipi10.htm#fr_123.md) This notion furnishes
an easy explanation, founded on the human sacrifices to the Phoenician
deity, of the curious verse in Genesis as to the avengging of Lamekh.
Lamekh here referred to was not father of Noah. Compare Genesis iv.
18-24, with v. 25-29.

xxx, dove or symbol of femininity, going to Joppa, a seaport where
Dag-on the fish-god was worshipped, and having entered a ship is
swallowed by a Ceto or great fish, betrays a suspicious relationship to
the same cultus. The fish was revered at Joppa as the dove was at
Nineveh. Was there an esoteric meaning?--Ed.

evidently symbolical of life. In the Mahabharata, Mahadeva is described
as having "a girdle of serpents, ear-rings of serpents, a sacrificial
cord of serpents, and an outer garment of serpent's skin." (Dr. Muir,
op. cit., part iv., p. 160.)

<span id="fn_140"></span>[141](ipi12.htm#fr_140.md) It should not be
forgotten that the Vedic religion was not that of all the Aryan tribes
of India. (See Muir, op. cit., part ii., p. 377, 368-383) ; and it is by
no means improbable that some of them retained a more primitive faith,
Buddhism or Rudraism; i.e., Sivaism. See also Baldwin's Prehistoric
Nations.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[142](ipi12.htm#fr_141.md) Op. cit., p. 62. To
come to a proper conclusion on this important point, it is necessary to
consider the real position occupied by Gautama in relation to
Brahminism. Burnouf says that he differed from his adversaries only in
the definition he gives of Salvation (du salut). (Introduction a
l'Histoire du Buddhisme Indien, p. 155.)

<span id="fn_151"></span>[152](ipi12.htm#fr_151.md) Hence Siva, as Sambhu,
is the patron deity of the Brahmanic order; and the most intellectual
Hindus of the present day are to be found among his followers. (See
Wilson, op. cit., p. 171. Sherring's Sacred City of the Hindus, p. 146
et seq.)

<span id="fn_152"></span>[153](ipi12.htm#fr_152.md) The bull of Siva has
reference to strength and speed rather than to fecundity; while the
Rig-Veda refers to Vishnu as the framer of the womb, although elsewhere
he is described as the fecundator. (See Muir, op. cit., part iv., pp.
244, 292, also pp. 64, 83.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[162](ipi13.htm#fr_161.md) We must look to the
esoteric teaching of Mithraism for the origin and explanation of much of
primitive Christian dogma.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[163](ipi13.htm#fr_162.md) The serpent elevated in
the Wilderness is said to be typical of Christ. (John iii. 14, 15). A

<span id="fn_164"></span>[165](ipi13.htm#fr_164.md) It is a curious fact
that Buddhist deities are often represented in the Vessica and with the
nimbus. (See Hodgson's figures, plates v. and vi. in the Journal of the
Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 18.)

<span id="fn_168"></span>[169](ipi13.htm#fr_168.md) The "Black Virgins" of
the French cathedrals prove, when examined critically, to be basalt
figures of the goddess Isis. The Virgin Mary succeeded to her form,
titles, symbols, rites, and ceremonies. Thus the devotees of Isis
carried into the new priesthood the former badges of their profession,
the obligation to celibacy, the tonsure, and the surplice. The sacred
image still moves in procession as when Juvenal laughed at it--vi.
530--"grege linigero circumdatus et grege calvo"-- escorted by the
tonsured, surpliced train. Her proper title, Domina, the exact
translation of the Sanscrit Isi, survives, with a slight change in the
Madonna. By a singular permutation, the flower borne by each, the lotus,
ancient emblem of fecundity, now renamed the lily, is interpreted as
significant of the opposite quality. The tinkling sistrum, a sound so
well pleasing to the Egyptian goddess, is replaced by that most hideous
of noises, the clattering bell. The latter instrument, however, came
directly from the Buddhist usages, where it forms as essential an
element as of yore in early Celtic Christianity, when the holy bell was
the actual type of the Godhead to the new converts. The bell in its
present form was unknown to the ancients; its normal shape is Indian,
and the first real bell-founders were the Buddhist Chinese. Again,
relic-worship seems from the third century to have been virtually the
present form of Christianity in the East. A fragment of the bone of a
Buddha is indispensable in the founding of a temple of that faith.

It is astonishing how much of the Egyptian and the second-hand Indian
symbolism passed over into the usages of the following times. The high
cap and hooked staff of the god became the bishop's mitre and crosier;
the term nun is purely Egyptian, and bore its present meaning; the erect
oval, symbol of the Female Principle of Nature, became the Vesica
Piscis, and a frame for divine things; the Crux Ansata, testifying the
union of the Male and Female Principle in the most obvious manner, and
denoting fecundity and abundance, is transformed, by a simple inversion,
into the Orb surmounted by the Cross, and the ensign of royalty.
