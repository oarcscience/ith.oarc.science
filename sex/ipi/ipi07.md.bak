# THE GREAT RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT OF ARCHAIC TIME.

That some great religious movement, ascribed by tradition to Abraham,
did take place among the Semites at an early date is undoubted. What the
object of this movement was it is difficult to decide. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](ipi14.htm#fn_62.md) It should be remembered that the
Chaldeans worshipped a plurality of gods, supposed to have been
symbolized by the seven planets. Among these deities the sun-god held a
comparatively inferior position, the moon-god, coming before him in the
second triad. <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](ipi14.htm#fn_63.md) It was at
Ur, the special seat of the worship of the moon-god, <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](ipi14.htm#fn_64.md) that Abraham is said to have
lived before he quitted it for Haran; and this fact, considered in the
light of the traditions relating to the great patriarch, may, perhaps,
justify us in inferring that the reformation he endeavored to introduce
was the substitution of a simple sun-worship for the planetary cult of
the Chaldeans, in which the worship of the moon must to him have
appeared to occupy a prominent place. The new faith was, indeed, a
return to the old phallic idea of a god of personal generation,
worshipped through the symbolical betylus, but associated also with the
adoration of the sun as the especial representative of the deity. That
Abraham had higher notions of the relation of man to the divine being
than his forerunners is very probable, but his sojourn in Haran proves
that there was nothing fundamentally different between his religious
faith and that of his Syrian neighbors. I am inclined, indeed, to
believe that to the traditional Abraham must be ascribed the
establishment of sun-worship throughout Phoenicia and Lower Egypt, in
connection with the symbols of an earlier and more simple phallic deity.
Tradition, in fact, declares that he taught the Egyptians
astronomy; <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](ipi14.htm#fn_65.md) and we shall
see that the religion of the Phoenicians, as, indeed, that of the
Hebrews themselves, was the worship of Saturn, the erect pillar-god,
who, under different names, appears to have been at the head of the
pantheons of most of the peoples of antiquity. The reference in Hebrew
history to the teraphim of Jacob's family recalls the fact that the name
assigned to Abraham's father was Terah, a "maker of images." The
teraphim were, doubtless, the same as the seraphim, which were
serpent-images, <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](ipi14.htm#fn_66.md) and the
household charms, or idols, of the Semitic worshippers of the sun-god,
to whom the serpent was sacred.

Little is known of the religious habits of the Hebrews during their
abode in Egypt. Probably they scarcely differed from those of the
Egyptians themselves; and, even with the religion of Moses, so-called,
which we may presume to have been a reformed faith, there are many
points of contact with the earlier cult. The use of the ark of Osiris
and Isis shows the influence of Egyptian ideas; and the introduction of
the new name for God, Jahve, is evidence of contact with late Phoenician
thought. <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](ipi14.htm#fn_67.md) The ark was,
doubtless, used to symbolize nature, <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](ipi14.htm#fn_68.md) as distinguished from the
serpent- and pillar-symbols which had relation more particularly to man.
The latter, however, were by far the most important, as they were most
intimately connected with the worship of the national deity, who was the
divine father, as Abraham was the human progenitor, of the Hebrew
people. That this deity, notwithstanding his change of name, retained
his character of a sun-god, is shown by the fact that he is repeatedly
said to have appeared to Moses under the figure of a flame. The pillar
of fire which guided the Hebrews by night in the wilderness, the
appearance of the cloudy pillar at the door of the tabernacle, and
probably of a flame over the mercy-seat to betoken the presence of
Jehovah, and the perpetual fire on the altar, all point to the same
conclusion. The notion entertained by Ewald, that the idea connected
with the Hebrew Jahve was that of a "Deliverer" or "Healer"
(Saviour), <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](ipi14.htm#fn_69.md) is quite
consistent with the fact I have stated. Not only was the primeval
Phoenician deity, El, or Cronus, the preserver of the world, for the
benefit of which he offered a mystical sacrifice, <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](ipi14.htm#fn_70.md) but "Saviour" was a common title
of the sun-gods of antiquity.
