## CHAPTER IX

### PROCREATION OF THOUGHT.

As far as we yet know, spirit or mind is the substance, it shows through
the body - is served by the body. - Koradine

In Karezza the procreation of thought is possible. Spirit is the ego,
the higher self, the Divine principle in man that expresses his unity
with all nature. The reader will remember that soul is spirit in action.
Soul is the "spiritual body" mentioned by Saint Paul; it bears a more
intimate relation to the physical body than a hand does to a glove.

In the soul all the activities of our being are impelled. The movement
of muscles, the processes of digestion and nutrition all occur as

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

manifestations of the spiritual or soul nature. It is in the soul that
we find the senses and emotions. The soul also has the power of choice,
and the ability to fashion character. Every soul has a dual nature, the
masculine and feminine; intellect and wisdom characterizing the male,
intuition and affection the female. These are existent to some degree in
every human being. Grindon says: "All that belongs to thought,
understanding or mind, is masculine; all that belongs to will,
intuition, affection of heart, is feminine."

When one acts immediately from the intellectual principle, manliness is
foremost, when from the will principle, womanliness. The most
consistent, perfect personality is that in which both the male and the
female principles are harmoniously developed. Since sex is of the soul,
is it not possible that as spiritual unity develops, thought may be
procreated? That

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

would mean a procreation on the spiritual plane of ideas and theories to
be practically developed for the good of the world.

The physical relation may or may not be of value for this higher
procreation. It has been proven, however, that in the Karezza relation
the creative principle becomes active in both husband and wife. While
the spiritual senses are thus attuned to the finest perception in soul
vibration, ideas of great moment are conceived. It is within the power
of men and women, interested in the operation of spiritual law, further
to demonstrate the validity of the theory.

Newton says:

> It is important to know that there are other uses for the procreative
> element than the generation of physical offspring, far better uses
> than its waste in momentary pleasure. It may, indeed, be better wasted
> than employed in imposing unwelcome burdens on toilworn
>
> <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>
>
> and outraged women. But there should be no waste. This element when
> retained in the system may be coined into new thoughts, perhaps new
> inventions, grand conceptions of the true, the beautiful, the useful;
> or into fresh emotions of joy, and impulses of kindness and blessing
> to all around. This is, in fact, but another department of
> procreation. It is the procreation of thoughts, ideas, feelings of
> good-will, intuitions of truth - that is, it is procreation on the
> mental and spiritual planes, instead of physical. It is just as really
> a part of the generative function as is the begetting of physical
> offspring. It is by far the greater part; for physical procreation can
> ordinarily be participated in but seldom; while mental and spiritual
> procreation may and should go on through all our earthly lives - yea,
> through all our immortal existence.

To the mature man a consecration of virile powers is essential to the
maintenance of a high tone of vitality and of manly vigor. On it depends
the degree of positive or impregnative force which characterizes the
individual in his mental activities.

A speaker or writer who is addicted to waste in this department, though
he may talk and write with great profuseness, may expect that his words
will be comparatively powerless in their effect upon others. They will
lack germinating power. But he who conserves this element, in a calm,
deliberate union, charges not only his words, but the very atmosphere,
with a power which penetrates and begets new thoughts and new emotions
in those whom he addresses.

"Every idea is an intellectual child, and if it be a pleasant thing to
have physical sons and

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

daughters, what are the power, the opulence, the enjoyments of him who
abounds in ideas, the beautiful and immortal sons and daughters of the
soul?"

Who, then, are the true old bachelors and old maids, and who the really
childless? Not so much the unmarried by ring and book, as they who have
not courted and wedded nature, receiving from her in reply a family of
beautiful ideas.

He is a spiritual parent who has learned to drink from the well of
truth, and from the deep resources of his being, has discovered the
secret powers of life. In outward manifestation he may preach, teach,
heal and prophesy, but should he sit quietly in his own home, his life
is a silent benediction to all, even to those who do not come into his
presence. His creative energy brings forth according to the potent power
of

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

thinking. Through the contagion of thought his influence has infinite
possibilities.

Spiritual pleasures transcend those of a physical nature, and all
practices that lead one to walk in the paths of light and truth conduce
to peace and harmony. Not only this, but through the laws that govern
the occult forces - in the practice of Karezza, there are far more
reaching results than accrue to the individual in the ordinary sexual
relation.

Long ago Laboulaye asserted that "the passions take the place in the
soul which the will does not occupy, and there may yet be discovered a
process by which passion may be transmuted into intellectual fibre. This
is, indeed, the last and highest possibility of human culture."

People will know this place, the functions of passion, and their
relations to the will when they understand the germinating power of
thought,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

and have their sexual life under a wise control. Men and women
practicing Karezza attest that their very souls in union take on a
procreating power, and that it seems to have an impregnating force, far
transcending in power and intelligence any ordinary thought force. These
mighty soul conceptions demand generation and birth, for the world is in
need of their regenerating power. Let all children of men listen for
these messages. Let them go into the hush of the spirit and wait in the
night stillness for the revelation. It may come in the fire of a poet or
the eloquence of an orator, but certainly if souls are attuned to life's
harmonies the law will be fulfilled in song and prophecy.

This silence is not mere silence of sound, but even thought is hushed,
the eyes forget to see and the ears forget to hear, only spirit listens
to spirit. It is as Koradine describes when

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

Tommy was healed: "Then came a deep, deep stillness that cleansed and
hushed all thought, for there was no need of thought, no room for
speech; just stillness, stillness." In this ecstatic stillness the
problems of the philanthropist are solved; the sculptor's marble glows
with life; the painter's canvas reflects love and intelligence; while
the desires of each are lifted to the highest and truest expressions of
the soul, expressions that shall hasten the universal brotherhood of
man.
