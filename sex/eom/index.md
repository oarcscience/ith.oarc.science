Karezza is a book by Alice Bunker Stockham, MD (b. 1833). She was one of
the first women medical school graduates in the USA and wrote a very
popular book on women's reproductive health, which was translated into
several languages. This later work, Karezza, elucidates "a theory of
conjugal life, in which there is a love communion between husband and
wife from which results a mastery of the physical." A highly-principled
Quaker distressed by all the unwanted pregnancies among her patients,
she also saw controlled intercourse as a way to prevent reckless
procreation and raise spiritual awareness. This second edition was
published in 1903.
