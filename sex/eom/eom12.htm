<p>I well perceive how in thine intellect already shines the eternal light, which once seen, always kindles love. - Dante</p>  
<p>Souls really united progress unitedly. This is the strongest and greatest argument of this altruistic union. The highest aim in life should be spiritual development and attainment of power and strength in this direction. Habits and conditions that contribute to this should be sought.</p>  
<p>Miller says: "With Zugassent's Discovery (Karezza) comes also the one, supreme truth, that its greatest crown of honor consists in its </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></p>  
<p>conducing to the highest and noblest spiritual development."</p>  
<p>What is spiritual development? It is coming into recognition of the supremacy of the spiritual over the physical; it is conscious mastery in one sense, and in another it is a knowledge of the God-like in man that takes possession of him, leading and guiding him in all the walks of life.</p>  
<p>It is true that in Karezza one experiences growth in the spiritual nature. This is obtained through the habit of self-control and mastery, and through the desire of each for the best good of the other, and to the high aspirations accompanying the relation. Once having experience in Karezza, one will never return to the ordinary habits in which sensuality and selfishness so often predominate.</p>  
<p>All spiritual experience is growth in the knowledge </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of man's divinity, of his inseparable union with the omnipresent principle of life. He may come to a sudden awakening of this great truth of his being which results in an instantaneous conversion, like Saul of Tarsus, or it may more slowly dawn upon his perception as in the case of Saul of old as he listened to the divine harmonies of David's harp.</p>  
<p>Whenever and however man perceives this truth, it is borne upon his inner consciousness that the real enduring things of life belong to the spirit, while the evanescent, fleeting, unstable things of life are of the material. He comes to rule his life according to this knowledge, and although he lives in the world, he is not of it, and all things present new meanings to him.</p>  
<p>In no part of life's domain are these new meanings more clearly perceived than in the reproductive powers. In the loving companionship </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of husband and wife, in the conception and birth of spiritual and physical offspring - in all their innermost relations, their lives are attuned to nature's harmonies, their very existence vibrates with the divine unity of the universe.</p>  
<p>Both men and women can train this creative energy into power. The word is the sword of the spirit. It is a well proven law that the reiteration of a thought brings about a condition which makes manifest what the thought expresses. Therefore, let one repeat again and again, "I am a creator, not merely of human children, but creator of thoughts, of ideas and of resources. I devote my great heart-love to the interests of the world. There is no task too onerous for my devotion, no service too difficult for my undertaking. All children are mine, all interests are mine, gladly and cheerfully I answer the call to serve those who need me. I am both </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>father and mother. In joy and gladness do I consecrate myself to the world."</p>  
<p>In this prayer of faith and fulfillment one recognizes the power of the omnipotent creative life principle, and in beneficence and freedom experiences a vivifying stimulus to works of love.</p>  
<p>Here is given a glimpse of the greatest spiritual law yet discovered. It is a key to self-training for power and mastery. It is power itself. This theory is not based upon denials, and the asceticisms of all religious teachings of the past. Oriental philosophers and western theologians have usually united in counseling people to kill out desire and passion. The Nirvana of existence and the sanctification of saints is alike to be beyond ambition and desire. On the contrary, the philosophy of today expounds a law of affirmation in which one attains development </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the self in power, together with a systematic consecration of all aspirations and faculties. We are living spiritual beings. Claiming this, we enter consciously into our possessions, understanding that we have creative powers born of the spirit. By wise appropriation of them we become superior to bodily conditions, until they wheel into line and serve us. We become greater than anything with which we have to deal. We enthrone the ego, which is spirit, and utilize something of the divine potency which has been hidden by human limitations and erroneous thinking. Man has been bound by ignorance, but he comes through development and spiritual consciousness to know his power.</p>  
<p>As God, life and law become synonymous in the student's mind, physical and spiritual science join hands in demonstrating the problems of existence. </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>No wider field of exploration is presented to the discoverer of nature's secrets than that of marital ethics. Groveling in the darkness of ignorance and superstition, man has hitherto closed to himself the doors of investigation in this province, labeling them unclean. Henceforth purity guards the entrance, and wisdom demands that youth shall not be deprived of the benefits of the experience of those who have knowledge to give. Instead of associating creative life and energy with things base and unclean, man will set all his thoughts to words as bright and enduring as the stars, and they will be the light, love and intelligence that guide his feet.</p>  
<p>If we can perceive beauty in everything of God's doings we may argue that we have reached the true perception of universal law. Ruskin</p>
