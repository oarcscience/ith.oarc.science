*The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana*, tr. by Richard Burton, \[1883\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PREFACE

IN the literature of all countries there will be found a certain number
of works treating especially of love. Everywhere the subject is dealt
with differently, and from various points of view. In the present
publication it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is
considered the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, and which
is called the 'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra', or Aphorisms on Love, by
Vatsyayana.

While the introduction will deal with the evidence concerning the date
of the writing, and the commentaries written upon it, the chapters
following the introduction will give a translation of the work itself.
It is, however, advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of
the same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote years after
Vatsyayana had passed away, but who still considered him as the great
authority, and always quoted him as the chief guide to Hindoo erotic
literature.

Besides the treatise of Vatsyayana the following works on the same
subject are procurable in India:

The Ratirahasya, or secrets of love  
The Panchasakya, or the five arrows  
The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love  
The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love  
The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love  
The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called Kamaledhiplava, or a
boat in the ocean of love.

The author of the 'Secrets of Love' was a poet named Kukkoka. He
composed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When
writing his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself 'Siddha
patiya pandita', i.e. an ingenious man among learned men. The work was
translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author's name was
written as Koka. And as the same name crept into all the translations
into other languages in India, the book became generally known, and the
subject was popularly called Koka Shastra, or doctrines of Koka, which
is identical with the Kama Shastra, or doctrines of love, and the words
Koka Shastra and Kama Shastra are used indiscriminately.

The work contains nearly eight hundred verses, and is divided into ten
chapters, which are called Pachivedas. Some of the things treated of in
this work are not to be found in the Vatsyayana, such as the four
classes of women, the Padmini, Chitrini, Shankini and Hastini, as also
the enumeration of the days and hours on which the women of the
different classes become subject to love, The author adds that he wrote
these things from the opinions of Gonikaputra and Nandikeshwara, both of
whom are mentioned by Vatsyayana, but their works are not now extant. It
is difficult to give any approximate idea as to the year in which the
work was composed. It is only to be presumed that it was written after
that of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject that
are still extant. Vatsyayana gives the names of ten authors on the
subject, all of whose works he had consulted, but none of which are
extant, and does not mention this one. This would tend to show that
Kukkoka wrote after Vatsya, otherwise Vatsya would assuredly have
mentioned him as an author in this branch of literature along with the
others.

The author of the 'Five Arrows' was one Jyotirisha. He is called the
chief ornament of poets, the treasure of the sixty-four arts, and the
best teacher of the rules of music. He says that he composed the work
after reflecting on the aphorisms of love as revealed by the gods, and
studying the opinions of Gonikaputra, Muladeva, Babhravya, Ramtideva,
Nundikeshwara and Kshemandra. It is impossible to say whether he had
perused all the works of these authors, or had only heard about them;
anyhow, none of them appear to be in existence now. This work contains
nearly six hundred verses, and is divided into five chapters, called
Sayakas or Arrows.

The author of the 'Light of Love' was the poet Gunakara, the son of
Vechapati. The work contains four hundred verses, and gives only a short
account of the doctrines of love, dealing more with other matters.

'The Garland of Love' is the work of the famous poet Jayadeva, who said
about himself that he is a writer on all subjects. This treatise is,
however, very short, containing only one hundred and twenty-five verses.

The author of the 'Sprout of Love' was a poet called Bhanudatta. It
appears from the last verse of the manuscript that he was a resident of
the province of Tirhoot, and son of a Brahman named Ganeshwar, who was
also a poet. The work, written in Sanscrit, gives the descriptions of
different classes of men and women, their classes being made out from
their age, description, conduct, etc. It contains three chapters, and
its date is not known, and cannot be ascertained.

'The Stage of Love' was composed by the poet Kullianmull, for the
amusement of Ladkhan, the son of Ahmed Lodi, the same Ladkhan being in
some places spoken of as Ladana Mull, and in others as Ladanaballa. He
is supposed to have been a relation or connection of the house of Lodi,
which reigned in Hindostan from A.D. 1450-1526. The work would,
therefore, have been written in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It
contains ten chapters, and has been translated into English but only six
copies were printed for private circulation. This is supposed to be the
latest of the Sanscrit works on the subject, and the ideas in it were
evidently taken from previous writings of the same nature.

The contents of these works are in themselves a literary curiosity.
There are to be found both in Sanscrit poetry and in the Sanscrit drama
a certain amount of poetical sentiment and romance, which have, in every
country and in every language, thrown an immortal halo round the
subject. But here it is treated in a plain, simple, matter of fact sort
of way. Men and women are divided into classes and divisions in the same
way that Buffon and other writers on natural history have classified and
divided the animal world. As Venus was represented by the Greeks to
stand forth as the type of the beauty of woman, so the Hindoos describe
the Padmini or Lotus woman as the type of most perfect feminine
excellence, as follows:

She in whom the following signs and symptoms appear is called a Padmini.
Her face is pleasing as the full moon; her body, well clothed with
flesh, is soft as the Shiras or mustard flower, her skin is fine, tender
and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark coloured. Her eyes are bright
and beautiful as the orbs of the fawn, well cut, and with reddish
corners. Her bosom is hard, full and high; she has a good neck; her nose
is straight and lovely, and three folds or wrinkles cross her middle -
about the umbilical region. Her yoni resembles the opening lotus bud,
and her love seed (Kama salila) is perfumed like the lily that has newly
burst. She walks with swan-like gait, and her voice is low and musical
as the note of the Kokila bird, she delights in white raiments, in fine
jewels, and in rich dresses. She eats little, sleeps lightly, and being
as respectful and religious as she is clever and courteous, she is ever
anxious to worship the gods, and to enjoy the conversation of Brahmans.
Such, then, is the Padmini or Lotus woman.

Detailed descriptions then follow of the Chitrini or Art woman; the
Shankhini or Conch woman, and the Hastini or Elephant woman, their days
of enjoyment, their various seats of passion, the manner in which they
should be manipulated and treated in sexual intercourse, along with the
characteristics of the men and women of the various countries in
Hindostan. The details are so numerous, and the subjects so seriously
dealt with, and at such length, that neither time nor space will permit
of their being given here.

One work in the English language is somewhat similar to these works of
the Hindoos. It is called 'Kalogynomia: or the Laws of Female Beauty',
being the elementary principles of that science, by T. Bell, M.D., with
twenty-four plates, and printed in London in 1821. It treats of Beauty,
of Love, of Sexual Intercourse, of the Laws regulating that Intercourse,
of Monogamy and Polygamy, of Prostitution, of Infidelity, ending with a
*catalogue raisonnée* of the defects of female beauty.

Other works in English also enter into great details of private and
domestic life: The Elements of Social Science, or Physical, Sexual and
Natural Religion, by a Doctor of Medicine, London, 1880, and Every
Woman's Book, by Dr Waters, 1826. To persons interested in the above
subjects these works will be found to contain such details as have been
seldom before published, and which ought to be thoroughly understood by
all philanthropists and benefactors of society.

After a perusal of the Hindoo work, and of the English books above
mentioned, the reader will understand the subject, at all events from a
materialistic, realistic and practical point of view. If all science is
founded more or less on a stratum of facts, there can be no harm in
making known to mankind generally certain matters intimately connected
with their private, domestic, and social life.

Alas! complete ignorance of them has unfortunately wrecked many a man
and many a woman, while a little knowledge of a subject generally
ignored by the masses would have enabled numbers of people to have
understood many things which they believed to be quite incomprehensible,
or which were not thought worthy of their consideration.
