The Kama Sutra is an ancient Indian text which is considered the primary
Sanskrit work on human sexuality. It was written by Mallanaga Vatsyayana
in the 2nd century CE. Although Burton published this, the most widely
known English translation, he was not the author of the translation,
although he did provide footnotes and the introduction. The bulk of the
translation was performed by an Indian archaeologist, Bhagvanlal Indraji
and civil servant Foster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot, with the assistance of a
student, Shivaram Pashuram Bhide. This is one of the first systematic
studies of human sexual behavior in world literature. It also documents
the sociology of sex in India eighteen centuries ago.
