## CHAPTER I

### ON MARRIAGE

WHEN a girl of the same caste, and a virgin, is married in accordance
with the precepts of Holy Writ, the results of such a union are the
acquisition of Dharma and Artha, offspring, affinity, increase of
friends, and untarnished love. For this reason a man should fix his
affections upon a girl who is of good family, whose parents are alive,
and who is three years or more younger than himself. She should be born
of a highly respectable family, possessed of wealth, well connected, and
with many relations and friends. She should also be beautiful, of a good
disposition, with lucky marks on her body, and with good hair, nails,
teeth, ears, eyes and breasts, neither more nor less than they ought to
be, and no one of them entirely wanting, and not troubled with a sickly
body. The man should, of course, also possess these qualities himself.
But at all events, says Ghotakamukha, a girl who has been already joined
with others (i.e. no longer a maiden) should never be loved, for it
would be reproachable to do such a thing.

Now in order to bring about a marriage with such a girl as described
above, thee parents and relations of the man should exert themselves, as
also such friends on both sides as may be desired to assist in the
matter. These friends should bring to the notice of the girl's parents,
the faults, both present and future, of all the other men that may wish
to marry her, and should at the same time extol even to exaggeration all
the excellencies, ancestral, and paternal, of their friend, so as to
endear him to them, and particularly to those that may be liked by the
girl's mother. One of the friends should also disguise himself as an
astrologer, and declare the future good fortune and wealth of his friend
by showing the existence of all the lucky omens <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](kama101.htm#fn_0.md) and signs, <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](kama101.htm#fn_1.md) the good influence of planets,
the auspicious entrance of the sun into a sign of the Zodiac, propitious
stars and fortunate marks on his body. Others again should rouse the
jealousy of the girl's mother by telling her that their friend has a
chance of getting from some other quarter even a better girl than hers.

A girl should be taken as a wife, as also given in marriage, when
fortune, signs, omens, and the words <span
id="fr_41"></span>[3](kama101.htm#fn_2.md) of others are favourable, for,
says Ghotakamukha, a man should not marry at any time he likes. A girl
who is asleep, crying, or gone out of the house when sought in marriage,
or who is betrothed to another, should not be married. The following
also should be avoided:

-   One who is kept concealed
-   One who has an ill-sounding name
-   One who has her nose depressed
-   One who has her nostril turned up
-   One who is formed like a male
-   One who is bent down
-   One who has crooked thighs
-   One who has a projecting forehead
-   One who has a bald head
-   One who does not like purity
-   One who has been polluted by another
-   One who is affected with the Gulma <span
    id="fr_42"></span>[4](kama102.htm#fn_6.md)
-   One who is disfigured in any way
-   One who has fully arrived at puberty
-   One who is a friend
-   One who is a younger sister
-   One who is a Varshakari <span
    id="fr_43"></span>[5](kama104.htm#fn_13.md)

In the same way a girl who is called by the name of one of the
twenty-seven stars, or by the name of a tree, or of a river, is
considered worthless, as also a girl whose name ends in 'r' or 'l'. But
some authors say that prosperity is gained only by marrying that girl to
whom one becomes attached, and that therefore no other girl but the one
who is loved should be married by anyone.

When a girl becomes marriageable her parents should dress her smartly,
and should place her where she can be easily seen by all. Every
afternoon, having dressed her and decorated her in a becoming manner,
they should send her with her female companions to sports, sacrifices,
and marriage ceremonies, and thus show her to advantage in society,
because she is a kind of merchandise. They should also receive with kind
words and signs of friendliness those of an auspicious appearance who
may come accompanied by their friends and relations for the purpose of
marrying their daughter, and under some pretext or other having first
dressed her becomingly, should then present her to them. After this they
should await the pleasure of fortune, and with this object should
appoint a future day on which a determination could be come to with
regard to their daughter's marriage. On this occasion when the persons
have come, the parents of the girl should ask them to bathe and dine,
and should say, 'Everything will take place at the proper time', and
should not then comply with the request, but should settle the matter
later.

When a girl is thus acquired, either according to the custom of the
country, or according to his own desire, the man should marry her in
accordance with the precepts of the Holy Writ, according to one of the
four kinds of marriage.

Thus ends marriage.

There are also some verses on the subject as follows:

'Amusement in society, such as completing verses begun by others,
marriages, and auspicious ceremonies should be carried on neither with
superiors, nor inferiors, but with our equals. That should be known as a
high connection when a man, after marrying a girl, has to serve her and
her relations afterwards like a servant, and such a connection is
censured by the good. On the other hand, that reproachable connection,
where a man, together with his relations, lords it over his wife, is
called a low connection by the wise. But when both the man and the woman
afford mutual pleasure to each other, and when the relatives on both
sides pay respect to one another, such is called a connection in the
proper sense of the word. Therefore a man should contract neither a high
connection by which he is obliged to bow down afterwards to his kinsmen,
nor a low connection, which is universally reprehended by all.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_39"></span>[1](#fr_-1.md) The flight of a blue jay on a
person's left side is considered a lucky omen when one starts on any
business; the appearance of a cat before anyone at such a time is looked
on as a bad omen. There are many omens of the same kind.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[2](#fr_-1.md) Such as the throbbing of the right
eye of men and the left eye of women, etc.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[3](#fr_-1.md) Before anything is begun it is a
custom to go early in the morning to a neighbour's house, and overhear
the first words that may be spoken in his family, and according as the
words heard are of good or bad import, to draw an inference as to the
success or failure of the undertaking.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[4](#fr_-1.md) A disease consisting of any
glandular enlargement in any part of the body.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[5](#fr_-1.md) A woman, the palms of whose hands
and the soles of whose feet are always perspiring.
