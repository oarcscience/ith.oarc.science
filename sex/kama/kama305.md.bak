## CHAPTER V

### ON CERTAIN FORMS OF MARRIAGE <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](kama101.htm#fn_0.md)

WHEN a girl cannot meet her lover frequently in private, she should send
the daughter of her nurse to him, it being understood that she has
confidence in her, and had previously gained her over to her interests.
On seeing the man, the daughter of the nurse should, in the course of
conversation, describe to him the noble birth, the good disposition, the
beauty, talent, skill, knowledge of human nature and affection of the
girl in such a way as not to let him suppose that she had been sent by
the girl, and should thus create affection for the girl in the heart of
the man. To the girl also she should speak about the excellent qualities
of the man, especially of those qualities which she knows are pleasing
to the girl. She should, moreover, speak with disparagement of the other
lovers of the girl, and talk about the avarice and indiscretion of their
parents, and the fickleness of their relations. She should also quote
samples of many girls of ancient times, such as Sakoontala and others,
who, having united themselves with lovers of their own caste and their
own choice, were ever happy afterwards in their society. And she should
also tell of other girls who married into great families, and being
troubled by rival wives, became wretched and miserable, and were finally
abandoned. She should further speak of the good fortune, the continual
happiness, the chastity, obedience, and affection of the man, and if the
girl gets amorous about him, she should endeavour to allay her
shame <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](kama101.htm#fn_1.md) and her fear as well
as her suspicions about any disaster that might result from her
marriage. In a word, she should act the whole part of a female messenger
by telling the girl all about the man's affection for her, the places he
frequented, and the endeavours he made to meet her, and by frequently
repeating, 'It will be all right if the man will take you away forcibly
and unexpectedly.'

#### The Forms of Marriage

When the girl is gained over, and acts openly with the man as his wife,
he should cause fire to be brought from the house of a Brahman, and
having spread the Kusha grass upon the ground, and offered an oblation
to the fire, he should marry her according to the precepts of the
religious law. After this he should inform his parents of the fact,
because it is the opinion of ancient authors that a marriage solemnly
contracted in the presence of fire cannot afterwards be set aside.

After the consummation of the marriage, the relations of the man should
gradually be made acquainted with the affair, and the relations of the
girl should also be apprised of it in such a way that they may consent
to the marriage, and overlook the manner in which it was brought about,
and when this is done they should afterwards be reconciled by
affectionate presents and favourable conduct. In this manner the man
should marry the girl according to the Gandharva form of marriage.

When the girl cannot make up her mind, or will not express her readiness
to marry, the man should obtain her in any one of the following ways:

On a fitting occasion, and under some excuse, he should, by means of a
female friend with whom he is well acquainted, and whom he can trust,
and who also is well known to the girl's family, get the girl brought
unexpectedly to his house, and he should then bring fire from the house
of a Brahman, and proceed as before described.

When the marriage of the girl with some other person draws near, the man
should disparage the future husband to the utmost in the mind of the
mother of the girl, and then having got the girl to come with her
mother's consent to a neighbouring house, he should bring fire from the
house of a Brahman, and proceed as above.

The man should become a great friend of the brother of the girl, the
said brother being of the same age as himself, and addicted to
courtesans, and to intrigues with the wives of other people, and should
give him assistance in such matters, and also give him occasional
presents. He should then tell him about his great love for his sister,
as young men will sacrifice even their lives for the sake of those who
may be of the same age, habits, and dispositions as themselves. After
this the man should get the girl brought by means of her brother to some
secure place, and having brought fire from the house of a Brahman should
proceed as before.

The man should on the occasion of festivals get the daughter of the
nurse to give the girl some intoxicating substance, and then cause her
to be brought to some secure place under the pretence of some business,
and there having enjoyed her before she recovers from her intoxication,
should bring fire from the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.

The man should, with the connivance of the daughter of the nurse, carry
off the girl from her house while she is asleep, and then, having
enjoyed her before she recovers from her sleep, should bring fire from
the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.

When the girl goes to a garden, or to some village in the neighbourhood,
the man should, with his friends, fall on her guards, and having killed
them, or frightened them away, forcibly carry her off, and proceed as
before.

There are verses on this subject as follows:

'In all the forms of marriage given in this chapter of this work, the
one that precedes is better than the one that follows it on account of
its being more in accordance with the commands of religion, and
therefore it is only when it is impossible to carry the former into
practice that the latter should be resorted to, As the fruit of all good
marriages is love, the Gandharva <span
id="fr_48"></span>[3](kama101.htm#fn_2.md) form of marriage is respected,
even though it is formed under unfavourable circumstances, because it
fulfils the object sought for. Another cause of the respect accorded to
the Gandharva form of marriage is that it brings forth happiness, causes
less trouble in its performance than the other forms of marriage, and is
above all the result of previous love.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_46"></span>[1](#fr_-1.md) These forms of marriage differ from
the four kinds of marriage mentioned in Chapter I, and are only to be
made use of when the girl is gained over in the way mentioned in
Chapters III and IV.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[2](#fr_-1.md) About this, see a story on the fatal
effects of love at of *Early Ideas: a Group of Hindoo Stories*,
collected and collated by Anaryan, W. H. Allen and Co., London, 1881.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[3](#fr_-1.md) 'About the Gandharvavivaha form of
marriage, see note to page 28 of Captain R. F. Burton's *Vickram and the
Vampire; or Tales of Hindu Devilry*, Longmans, Green and Co., London
1870. This form of matrimony was recognised by the ancient Hindoos, and
is frequent in hooks. It is a kind of Scotch
wedding--ultra-Caledonian--taking place by mutual consent without any
form or Ceremony. The Gandharvas are heavenly minstrels of Indra's
court, who are opposed to be witnesses.
