## CHAPTER III

### ON THE ARTS AND SCIENCES TO BE STUDIED

MAN should study the Kama Sutra and the arts and sciences subordinate
thereto, in addition to the study of the arts and sciences contained in
Dharma and Artha. Even young maids should study this Kama Sutra along
with its arts and sciences before marriage, and after it they should
continue to do so with the consent of their husbands.

Here some learned men object, and say that females, not being allowed to
study any science, should not study the Kama Sutra.

But Vatsyayana is of opinion that this objection does not hold good, for
women already know the practice of Kama Sutra, and that practice is
derived from the Kama Shastra, or the science of Kama itself. Moreover,
it is not only in this but in many other cases that, though the practice
of a science is known to all, only a few persons are acquainted with the
rules and laws on which the science is based. Thus the Yadnikas or
sacrificers, though ignorant of grammar, make use of appropriate words
when addressing the different Deities, and do not know how these words
are framed. Again, persons do the duties required of them on auspicious
days, which are fixed by astrology, though they are not acquainted with
the science of astrology. In a like manner riders of horses and
elephants train these animals without knowing the science of training
animals, but from practice only. And similarly the people of the most
distant provinces obey the laws of the kingdom from practice, and
because there is a king over them, and without further reason. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](kama101.htm#fn_0.md) And from experience we find that
some women, such as daughters of princes and their ministers, and public
women, are actually versed in the Kama Shastra.

A female, therefore, should learn the Kama Shastra, or at least a part
of it, by studying its practice from some confidential friend. She
should study alone in private the sixty-four practices that form a part
of the Kama Shastra. Her teacher should be one of the following persons:
the daughter of a nurse brought up with her and already married, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](kama101.htm#fn_1.md) or a female friend who can be
trusted in everything, or the sister of her mother (i.e. her aunt), or
an old female servant, or a female beggar who may have formerly lived in
the family, or her own sister who can always be trusted.

The following are the arts to be studied, together with the Kama Sutra:

-   Singing

-   Solution of riddles, enigmas, covert speeches, verbal puzzles and

-   A game, which consisted in repeating verses, and as one person
    finished, another person had to commence at once, repeating another
    verse, beginning with the same letter with which the last speaker's
    verse ended, whoever failed to repeat was considered to have lost,
    and to be subject to pay a forfeit or stake of some kind
-   The art of mimicry or imitation
-   Reading, including chanting and intoning
-   Study of sentences difficult to pronounce. It is played as a game
    chiefly by women, and children and consists of a difficult sentence
    being given, and when repeated quickly, the words are often
    transposed or badly pronounced
-   Practice with sword, single stick, quarter staff and bow and arrow

    kinds. Some speak by changing the beginning and end of words, others
    by adding unnecessary letters between every syllable of a word, and
    so on
-   Knowledge of language and of the vernacular dialects
-   Art of making flower carriages
-   Art of framing mystical diagrams, of addressing spells and charms,
    and binding armlets
-   Mental exercises, such as completing stanzas or verses on receiving
    a part of them; or supplying one, two or three lines when the
    remaining lines are given indiscriminately from different verses, so
    as to make the whole an entire verse with regard to its meaning; or
    arranging the words of a verse written irregularly by separating the
    vowels from the consonants, or leaving them out altogether; or
    putting into verse or prose sentences represented by signs or
    symbols. There are many other such exercises.
-   Composing poems
-   Knowledge of dictionaries and vocabularies
-   Knowledge of ways of changing and disguising the appearance of
    persons

A public woman, endowed with a good disposition, beauty and other
winning qualities, and also versed in the above arts, obtains the name
of a Ganika, or public woman of high quality, and receives a seat of
honour in an assemblage of men. She is, moreover, always respected by
the king, and praised by learned men, and her favour being sought for by
all, she becomes an object of universal regard. The daughter of a king
too as well as the daughter of a minister, being learned in the above
arts, can make their husbands favourable to them, even though these may
have thousands of other wives besides themselves. And in the same
manner, if a wife becomes separated from her husband, and falls into
distress, she can support herself easily, even in a foreign country, by
means of her knowledge of these arts. Even the bare knowledge of them
gives attractiveness to a woman, though the practice of them may be only
possible or otherwise according to the circumstances of each case. A man
who is versed in these arts, who is loquacious and acquainted with the
arts of gallantry, gains very soon the hearts of women, even though he
is only acquainted with them for a short time.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_7"></span>[1](#fr_-1.md) The author wishes to prove that a
great many things are done by people from practice and custom, without
their being acquainted with the reason of things, or the laws on which
they are based, and this is perfectly true.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[2](#fr_-1.md) The proviso of being married applies
to all the teachers.
