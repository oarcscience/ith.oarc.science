## CHAPTER IV

### THE LIFE OF A CITIZEN

HAVING thus acquired learning, a man, with the wealth that he may have
gained by gift, conquest, purchase, deposit, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](kama101.htm#fn_0.md) or inheritance from his
ancestors, should become a householder, and pass the life of a
citizen. <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](kama101.htm#fn_1.md) He should take a
house in a city, or large village, or in the vicinity of good men, or in
a place which is the resort of many persons. This abode should be
situated near some water, and divided into different compartments for
different purposes. It should be surrounded by a garden, and also
contain two rooms, an outer and an inner one. The inner room should be
occupied by the females, while the outer room, balmy with rich perfumes,
should contain a bed, soft, agreeable to the sight, covered with a clean
white cloth, low in the middle part, having garlands and bunches of
flowers <span id="fr_11"></span>[3](kama101.htm#fn_2.md) upon it, and a
canopy above it, and two pillows, one at the top, another at the bottom.
There should be also a sort of couch besides, and at the head of this a
sort of stool, on which should be placed the fragrant ointments for the
night, as well as flowers, pots containing collyrium and other fragrant
substances, things used for perfuming the mouth, and the bark of the
common citron tree. Near the couch, on the ground, there should be a pot
for spitting, a box containing ornaments, and also a lute hanging from a
peg made of the tooth of an elephant, a board for drawing, a pot
containing perfume, some books, and some garlands of the yellow amaranth
flowers. Not far from the couch, and on the ground, there should be a
round seat, a toy cart, and a board for playing with dice; outside the
outer room there should be cages of birds, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[4](kama102.htm#fn_6.md) and a separate place for
spinning, carving and such like diversions. In the garden there should
be a whirling swing and a common swing, as also a bower of creepers
covered with flowers, in which a raised parterre should be made for
sitting.

Now the householder, having got up in the morning and performed his
necessary duties, <span id="fr_13"></span>[5](#fn_13.md) should wash his
teeth, apply a limited quantity of ointments and perfumes to his body,
put some ornaments on his person and collyrium on his eyelids and below
his eyes, colour his lips with alacktaka, <span
id="fr_14"></span>[6](#fn_14.md) and look at himself in the glass. Having
then eaten betel leaves, with other things that give fragrance to the
mouth, he should perform his usual business. He should bathe daily,
anoint his body with oil every other day, apply a lathering
substance <span id="fr_15"></span>[7](#fn_15.md) to his body every three
days, get his head (including face) shaved every four days and the other
parts of his body every five or ten days. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[8](#fn_16.md) All these things should be done without
fail, and the sweat of the armpits should also be removed. Meals should
be taken in the forenoon, in the afternoon, and again at night,
according to Charayana. After breakfast, parrots and other birds should
be taught to speak, and the fighting of cocks, quails, and rams should
follow. A limited time should be devoted to diversions with Pithamardas,
Vitas, and Vidushakas, <span id="fr_17"></span>[9](#fn_17.md) and then
should be taken the midday sleep. <span id="fr_18"></span>[10](#fn_18.md)
After this the householder, having put on his clothes and ornaments,
should, during the afternoon, converse with his friends. In the evening
there should be singing, and after that the householder, along with his
friend, should await in his room, previously decorated and perfumed, the
arrival of the woman that may be attached to him, or he may send a
female messenger for her, or go for her himself. After her arrival at
his house, he and his friend should welcome her, and entertain her with
a loving and agreeable conversation. Thus end the duties of the day.

The following are the things to be done occasionally as diversions or
amusements:

-   Holding festivals <span id="fr_19"></span>[11](#fn_19.md) in honour of
    different Deities
-   Social gatherings of both sexes
-   Drinking parties
-   Picnics
-   Other social diversions

#### Festivals

On some particular auspicious day, an assembly of citizens should be
convened in the temple of Saraswati. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[12](#fn_20.md) There the skill of singers, and of others
who may have come recently to the town, should be tested, and on the
following day they should always be given some rewards. After that they
may either be retained or dismissed, according as their performances are
liked or not by the assembly. The members of the assembly should act in
concert, both in times of distress as well as in times of prosperity,
and it is also the duty of these citizens to show hospitality to
strangers who may have come to the assembly. What is said above should
be understood to apply to all the other festivals which may be held in
honour of the different Deities, according to the present rules.

 

#### Social Gatherings

When men of the same age, disposition and talents, fond of the same
diversions and with the same degree of education, sit together in
company with public women, <span id="fr_21"></span>[13](#fn_21.md) or in an
assembly of citizens, or at the abode of one among themselves, and
engage in agreeable discourse with each other, such is called a Sitting
in company or a social gathering. The subjects of discourse are to be
the completion of verses half composed by others, and the testing the
knowledge of one another in the various arts. The women who may be the
most beautiful, who may like the same things that the men like, and who
may have power to attract the minds of others, are here done homage to.

 

#### Drinking Parties

Men and women should drink in one another's houses. And here the men
should cause the public women to drink, and should then drink
themselves, liquors such as the Madhu, Aireya, Sara and Asawa, which are
of bitter and sour taste; also drinks concocted from the barks of
various trees, wild fruits and leaves.

 

#### Going to Gardens or Picnics

In the forenoon, men having dressed themselves should go to gardens on
horseback, accompanied by public women and followed by servants. And
having done there all the duties of the day, and passed the time in
various agreeable diversions, such as the fighting of quails, cocks and
rams, and other spectacles, they should return home in the afternoon in
the same manner, bringing with them bunches of flowers, etc.

The same also applies to bathing in summer in water from which wicked or
dangerous animals have previously been taken out, and which has been
built in on all sides.

#### Other Social Diversions

Spending nights playing with dice. Going out on moonlight nights.
Keeping the festive day in honour of spring. Plucking the sprouts and
fruits of the mango trees. Eating the fibres of lotuses. Eating the
tender ears of corn. Picnicing in the forests when the trees get their
new foliage. The Udakakashvedika or sporting in the water. Decorating
each other with the flowers of some trees. Pelting each other with the
flowers of the Kadamba tree, and many other sports which may either be
known to the whole country, or may be peculiar to particular parts of
it. These and similar other amusements should always be carried on by
citizens.

The above amusements should be followed by a person who diverts himself
alone in company with a courtesan, as well as by a courtesan who can do
the same in company with her maid servants or with citizens.

A Pithamarda <span id="fr_22"></span>[14](#fn_22.md) is a man without
wealth, alone in the world, whose only property consists of his
Mallika, <span id="fr_23"></span>[15](#fn_23.md) some lathering substance
and a red cloth, who comes from a good country, and who is skilled in
all the arts; and by teaching these arts is received in the company of
citizens, and in the abode of public women.

A Vita <span id="fr_24"></span>[16](#fn_24.md) is a man who has enjoyed the
pleasures of fortune, who is a compatriot of the citizens with whom he
associates, who is possessed of the qualities of a houseliolder, who has
his wife with him, and who is honoured in the assembly of citizens and
in the abodes of public women, and lives on their means and on them. A
Vidushaka <span id="fr_25"></span>[17](#fn_25.md) (also called a Vaihasaka,
i.e. one who provokes laughter) is a person only acquainted with some of
the arts, who is a jester, and who is trusted by all.

These persons are employed in matters of quarrels and reconciliations
between citizens and public women.

This remark applies also to female beggars, to women with their heads
shaved, to adulterous women, and to public women skilled in all the
various arts.

Thus a citizen living in his town or village, respected by all, should
call on the persons of his own caste who may be worth knowing. He should
converse in company and gratify his friends by his society, and obliging
others by his assistance in various matters, he should cause them to
assist one another in the same way.

There are some verses on this subject as follows:

'A citizen discoursing, not entirely in the Sanscrit language, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[18](#fn_26.md) nor wholly in the dialects of the
country, on various topics in society, obtains great respect. The wise
should not resort to a society disliked by the public, governed by no
rules, and intent on the destruction of others. But a learned man living
in a society which acts according to the wishes of the people, and which
has pleasure for its only object is highly respected in this world.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[1](#fr_-1.md) Gift is peculiar to a Brahman,
conquest to a Kshatrya, while purchase, deposit, and other means of
acquiring wealth belongs to the Vaishya.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[2](#fr_-1.md) This term would appear to apply
generally to an inhabitant of Hindoostan. it is not meant only for a
dweller in a city, like the Latin Urbanus as opposed to Rusticus.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[3](#fr_-1.md) Natural garden flowers.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[4](#fr_-1.md) Such as quails, partridges, parrots,
starlings, etc.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[5](kama505.htm#fr_63.md) The calls of nature are
always performed by the Hindoos the first thing in the morning.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[6](kama505.htm#fr_64.md) A colour made from lac.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[7](kama505.htm#fr_65.md) This would act instead of
soap, which was not introduced until the rule of the Mahomedans.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[8](kama505.htm#fr_66.md) Ten days are allowed when
the hair is taken out with a pair of pincers.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[9](kama104.htm#fr_17.md) These are characters
generally introduced in the Hindoo drama; their characteristics will be
explained further on.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[10](kama104.htm#fr_18.md) Noonday sleep is only
allowed in summer, when the nights are short.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[11](kama104.htm#fr_19.md) These are very common in
all parts of India.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[12](kama104.htm#fr_20.md) In the 'Asiatic
Miscellany', and in Sir W. Jones's works, will be found a spirited hymn
addressed to this goddess, who is adored as the patroness of the fine
arts, especially of music and rhetoric, as the inventress of the
Sanscrit language, etc. etc. She is the goddess of harmony, eloquence
and language, and is somewhat analogous to Minerva. For farther
information about her, see Edward Moor's Hindoo Pantheon.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[13](kama104.htm#fr_21.md) The public women, or
courtesans (Vesya), of the early Hindoos have often been compared with
the Hetera of the Greeks. The subject is dealt with at some length in H.
H. Wilson's Select Specimens of the Theatre of the Hindoos, in two
volumes, Trubner and Co., 1871. It may be fairly considered that the
courtesan was one of the elements, and an important element too, of
early Hindoo society, and that her education and intellect were both
superior to that of the women of the household. Wilson says, 'By the
Vesya or courtesan, however, we are not to understand a female who has
disregarded the obligation of law or the precepts of virtue, but a
character reared by a state of manners unfriendly to the admission of
wedded females into society, and opening it only at the expense of
reputation to women who were trained for association with men by
personal and mental acquirements to which the matron was a stranger.'

<span id="fn_22"></span>[14](kama104.htm#fr_22.md) According to this
description a Pithamarda would be a sort of professor of all the arts,
and as such received as the friend and confidant of the citizen

<span id="fn_23"></span>[15](kama104.htm#fr_23.md) A seat in the form of
the letter T.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[16](kama104.htm#fr_24.md) The Vita is supposed to
represent somewhat the character of the Parasite of the Greek comedy. It
is possible that he was retained about the person of the wealthy and
dissipated as a kind of private instructor, as well as an entertaining
companion.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[17](kama104.htm#fr_25.md) Vidushaka is evidently
the buffoon and jester. Wilson says of him that he is the humble
companion, not the servant, of a prince or man of rank, and it is a
curious peculiarity that he is always a Brahman. He bears more affinity
to Sancho Panza, perhaps than any other character in western fiction,
imitating him in his combination of shrewdness and simplicity, his
fondness of good living and his love of ease. In the dramas of intrigue
he exhibits some of the talents of Mercury, but with less activity and
ingenuity, and occasionally suffers by his interference. According to
the technical definition of his attributes he is to excite mirth by
being ridiculous in person, age, and attire.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[18](kama104.htm#fr_26.md) This means, it is
presumed, that the citizen should be acquainted with several languages.
The middle part of this paragraph might apply to the Nihilists and
Fenians of the day, or to secret societies. It was perhaps a reference
to the Thugs.
