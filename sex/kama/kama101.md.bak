# PART I

## CHAPTER I

### PREFACE

Salutation to Dharma, Artha and Kama

IN the beginning, the Lord of Beings created men and women, and in the
form of commandments in one hundred thousand chapters laid down rules
for regulating their existence with regard to Dharma, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) Artha, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) and
Kama. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) Some of these commandments,
namely those which treated of Dharma, were separately written by
Swayambhu Manu; those that related to Artha were compiled by Brihaspati;
and those that referred to Kama were expounded by Nandi, the follower of
Mahadeva, in one thousand chapters.

Now these 'Kama Sutra' (Aphorisms on Love), written by Nandi in one
thousand chapters, were reproduced by Shvetaketu, the son of Uddvalaka,
in an abbreviated form in five hundred chapters, and this work was again
similarly reproduced in an abridged form, in one hundred and fifty
chapters, by Babhravya, an inheritant of the Punchala (South of Delhi)
country. These one hundred and fifty chapters were then put together
under seven heads or parts named severally

Sadharana (general topics)

Samprayogika (embraces, etc.)

Kanya Samprayuktaka (union of males and females)

Bharyadhikarika (on one's own wife)

Paradika (on the wives of other people)

Vaisika (on courtesans)

Aupamishadika (on the arts of seduction, tonic medicines, etc.)

The sixth part of this last work was separately expounded by Dattaka at
the request of the public women of Pataliputra (Patna), and in the same
way Charayana explained the first part of it. The remaining parts, viz.
the second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh, were each separately
expounded by

Suvarnanabha (second part)  
Ghotakamukha (third part)  
Gonardiya (fourth part)  
Gonikaputra (fifth part)  
Kuchumara (seventh part), respectively.

Thus the work being written in parts by different authors was almost
unobtainable and, as the parts which were expounded by Dattaka and the
others treated only of the particular branches of the subject to which
each part related, and moreover as the original work of Babhravya was
difficult to be mastered on account of its length, Vatsyayana,
therefore, composed his work in a small volume as an abstract of the
whole of the works of the above named authors.
