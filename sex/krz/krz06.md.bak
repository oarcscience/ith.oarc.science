## CLEANNESS

Always in the sexual life there should be cleanness - that innocence,
kindness, justice of feeling which instinctively prefers any sacrifice
of immediate passional pleasure rather than befoul or degrade a high
ideal, or to jeopardize the physical or spiritual health of the beloved,
or of self, or of the tenderly considered, possible unborn.

Cleanness expresses itself in a reverent regard and considerate
self-control at all times, concerning all things, thoughts, motions and
relations of sex, and the conscientious use of all organs and functions
in the service of the soul's ideal.

The clean may be mistaken, but whatever they do they cannot be impure.
