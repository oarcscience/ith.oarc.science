## THE WOMAN'S TIME OF GREAT DESIRE

he desire of a woman is seldom so comparatively constant and steady as
with a man, but fickle and variable, often latent, though the practice
in Karezza tends to equalize the sexes in this, but there are times
when, from various reasons, a wave of intense craving suddenly sweeps
over her. Particularly is this likely to happen just before the
appearance of the menses. And at such times the woman's desire is very
likely to exceed in wild, fiery force that of an ordinary man. Wherefore
it follows that very few women at such times get complete satisfaction,
leading to great disappointments and marital unhappiness. The unexpected
violence of the woman's emotion, upsets the man's nerves and causes
either a "too quick" orgasm, or complete psychic impotence.

Now I think the Karezza-man seldom has any difficulty with the woman
whose desire he has himself aroused by caresses and wooing. But when the
desire arises spontaneously in her, her natural tendency appears to be
to abandon herself to it, to abdicate all self-control, forget
everything else and recklessly, fiercely, almost madly demand sensual
gratification. This attitude is a very difficult one indeed for the
Karezza-lover to meet, because just in proportion to his fineness,
sensitiveness and real fitness to be a Karezza artist is his
susceptibility, almost to telepathy, to the woman's moods. If he meets
her on her own plane, the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

orgasm cannot be refused, while if he struggles against her for his
Karezza ideal, he is almost certain in the conflict either to lose his
poise or to become impotent. This is because this wild desire on her
part is normally related to reproduction and is intended by Nature to
overcome any male scruples and lead to an immediate embrace and swift
orgasm, followed by conception. If, however, the woman wills to have it
met on the Karezza plane, and converted into an esthetic love-embrace,
then she herself must take the initiative and put it on that plane. She
must begin the process by getting an inclusive grip on herself, relaxing
her tense muscles and steadying her quivering nerves. And no longer
concentrating altogether on the sexual, she must sublimate a portion of
her passion into heart-love, into a tender desire to encourage her lover
and assist him to complete success. The man, whose nerves have been
thrown into agitation by her ungoverned attitude and thrilling
vibrations, will recover courage and assurance the moment he senses the
aid of her self-control, and his proud power will return when her eyes
turn admiringly upon him and her tone and her touch give him her
confidence and the cooperating support of her strength.

The wise woman, skillful and trained in her art, will thus beautifully
control herself until the man has attained complete and deepest union
with her, and the blending current of their mutual magnetism is smoothly
running, and then will gradually, as he can bear it, turn on her
batteries full strength, reinforcing and redoubling his, till all need
of restraint disappears and she may let herself go to her uttermost of
bliss and expression, to the limit of complete satiety.

No other time affords an embrace so completely satisfying to the woman
as this, so full of joy to both, capable of reaching such heights of
ecstasy, but to realize this she must understand that it is up to her to
furnish her full half or more in skillful assistance and magnetic
contribution. A woman should be ashamed to expect the man alone to be
the Karezza-artist. She should take pride in her own superb sex-power,
the poetry of her rhythms, the artistry of her acts. She should have an
exulting delight in proving herself worthy of his adoration as the Queen
of Love.

And always this should be remembered: The more heart-love the more
sex-joy.
