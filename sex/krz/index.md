# The Karezza Method

## by J. William Lloyd

*The Karezza Method* published in 1931, is a beautiful, inspiring manual
about the practice of Karezza (controlled intercourse) by J. William
Lloyd. Thoughtfully written and based on actual experience, it brims
with practical information.

The author of *The Karezza Method* was apparently the same J. William
Lloyd who was known as the "drugless physician." He was a poet,
anarchist, writer, doctor, and editor of the *Free Comrade*. Lloyd
(1857-1940) authored various unpublished writings, copies of which are
housed in a special collection at the University of Michigan. These
include *Woman and the Larger Love* (1933); *A Brief Definition of the
Larger Love* (1929); and *New Ideals in Love* (1926), a lecture
delivered before the Workers' Forum of Los Angeles, California.

This e-book has been prepared by

of information closely related to the topic of this book.
