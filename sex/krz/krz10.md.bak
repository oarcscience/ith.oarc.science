## SEX-COMMERCE AND THE ELIXER OF LIFE

I believe that sex runs through all life, animal and vegetable - perhaps
through the inorganic world also. And that the sexes are cannibals,
feeding on each other - the sexes are *food* to each other.

I believe that both sexes are in the simplest uni-cell. That,
afterwards, as life evolves, there is a tendency to a division of labor
- to separate the sexes into two persons, but that always the two sexes
are more or less in one - always the male is part female, the female
part male in varying degrees of more or less.

I believe that the processes of life require as an essential a frequent,
if not constant, interchange of maleness with femaleness. I believe this
takes place within the organism constantly and in proportion to its
perfection there is beauty and health. In every cell there is this
interchange, and between different cells of the organism there is such
an exchange.

But just as in-and-in breeding finally "runs out" the strain, and leads
to deterioration, so in-and-in exchange of maleness and femaleness -
really the same thing - leads to deterioration at last, though many
things may assist to delay and postpone the process - change in
nourishment, in environment, etc.

Therefore the maleness of one person needs exchange with the femaleness
of some other person; the femaleness of one with the maleness of
another.

Homosexuality bases partly on the fact that this exchange may be
effected, with more or less satisfaction, sometimes, with persons of the
same sex (who, as both sexes are in one, are more or less persons of the
opposite sex also) but this too is a form of in-and-in exchange,
therefore the normal and best exchange is with persons whose sex is
visibly and predominantly opposite to one's own. Man normally goes to
woman, woman to man. And even here very opposite temperaments are
usually preferred, the smooth by the hairy, the red-headed by the
black-haired, the fat, by the lean, etc., because these have existed
under very different environments, have fed on different nourishment,
which they exchange through sex, and, so still further put away
in-and-in exchange and complement

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

each other's lacks - Nature always seeking an equilibrium and
redistribution of elements in alternation.

This exchange and mutual feeding can be effected in any way in which the
sexes can come into each other's aura, but it is most easily effected by
touch, and most perfectly by the complete union of Karezza. The sexual
orgasm having an entirely different purpose, that is, not the
nourishment of the two individuals concerned, but the transmission of
life and nourishment to another, a new and third organism starting from
these two, tends rather to defeat and prevent the nourishment of the
two, and is normally limited, usually, to propagation. To indulge in the
orgasm frequently, as a mere pleasure and indulgence, is to create a
vice - salacity.

I do not pretend to know what this sexual food is. We may theorise that
it is a "flux of electrons," a "current of corpuscles," "hormones," or
what not - who knows? - but its effects we may see. The thrill, the
vigor, the brilliancy, the glow of lovers; the "illusion," the
"glamour," the "romance" of love we all know. This means swift exchange
and joyous feasting. Suppose we call this food the Elixir of Life?

But the mere suggestion of this sexual exchange seems to marvelously
quicken and benefit even the inward in-and-in exchanges. Thus reading a
love letter, or a love story, handling a keepsake, thinking of a lover,
and a thousand other such things, may benefit the whole being by sex
suggestion.

There are those who claim that the cells of the animal organism go to
seed and that each one of these little molecules, or corpuscles, go to
the ova or spermatozoa to represent that cell in the new organism to be
formed by reproduction, so that the essence of everything in the parent
organism may be in the offspring. And there are Karezza-ites who explain
the thrill and exhilaration of Karezza by claiming that during its
exercise these vital seed-elements, not being thrown off by an orgasm,
are thrown, instead, into the circulation again and become a nerve food
and cell-elixir; perhaps leading to the return to the germ or sperm of
new seed-elements more vivified and electric than before. And that this
explains why the mere auto-suggestion

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

of love, above alluded to, if intense enough, by somewhat the same
process, seems to vitalize like Karezza.

This may not ultimately prove scientific, but I am inclined to accept it
and reconcile it with the preceding - to believe that love is a process
of self-feeding and redistribution of elements within the organism as
well as of mutual feeding and exchange between lovers.

And I believe that all human love that naturally seeks expression in
embracing is, at least largely, moved by and based upon this human need
of vital exchange and sexual rejuvenation.

Moreover, morally, we need to recognize that this desire of the sexes
for hugging, kissing, caressing, contact, closeness and the most
pressing and intimate touch, is not vicious or suspicious, but a
physiological, a *food* desire. One needs meats of sexual touch, just as
one needs meals of food, only not so often. The fullest life cannot be
lived without them. However, there can be sexual gluttony, just as there
can be food gluttony. And there can be foul, poisonous, unhealthy sexual
touches and contacts, just as there can be poisonous, foul, unhealthy
viands. Intelligence, selection, self-control, refinement, hygienic
wisdom and education, and a sensitive conscience, are needed with both.
But neither should be regarded from the attitude of prejudice or mere
sentiment, or convention, but from that of science, common sense and the
ideal.
