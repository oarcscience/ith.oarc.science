# THE KAREZZA METHOD

## or MAGNETATION:

#### The Art of Connubial Love

## by J. William Lloyd

### The Lover is the Artist in Touch

#### Karezza in the perfect form is natural marriage - that clinging, satisfied union of body and soul which true love ever craves and in which ideal marriage consists - and with every repetition of the act the lovers are remarried, their unity renewed, deepened, intensified.
