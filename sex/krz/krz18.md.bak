## KAREZZA THE [BEAUTIFIER](errata.htm#0.md)

When the full magnetic rapport of Karezza has been realized, in which
the two souls and bodies seem as one, supported and floating on some
divine stream in Paradise, all sense of restraint and difficulty gone,
and succeeded by a heavenly ease, power, exaltation, pure and perfect
bliss, diffused throughout the entire being, it is then that the eyes
and faces shine as though transfigured, every tone becomes music, every
emotion poetry. And this normally continues for a long time, perhaps
hours, gently subsiding, finally,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

into a sweet, contented lassitude and child-like slumber. But even to
the last moment of consciousness there is a most clinging and tender
affectionateness and desire to be close to the loved one, gratitude for
the gift of such joy; nothing of that indifference or revulsion usually
concluding the orgasmal embraces. And this continues after parting, even
for days, so that one walks in a heavenly dream, and where the embrace
is often repeated, tends to become a fixed and continuous habit,
resulting in the most ideal love; if the parting is permanent, remaining
in the memory for years, causing ever a gentle and tender reminiscence
to pervade the thought of the loved one.

It is because of this that Karezza, though a sex act, so wonderfully
increases and makes enduring the heart love. It is the embrace of the
angels; sex sublimed by soul.

And because of all this it excels all other forces or influences as a
beautifier. The faces of those who practice it tend to become
exceedingly beautiful, on the spiritual plane especially; that is to
say, it is the beauty of expression that is developed, rather than that
of feature, though the features surely but more slowly follow, a serene,
sweet light in the eye, a delicacy and refinement of line, a radiance
and play of feature, a glad timbre in the voice, that vibrates an
inexpressible magnetism and makes even the plainest personality
fascinating.

Owing to the blending of the two natures, their mutual exaltation and
reception of each other's moral qualities, it is soon to be noted that
lovers who practice Karezza display the fruits of such inspiration and
transmutation. The woman becomes strong, proud, confident, logical -
displaying the finer masculine - while the man becomes gentle,
considerate, compassionate, sympathetic, intuitive - revealing the finer
feminine. Thus the sexes spiritually change and interweave and become
at-one.

Is it any wonder if this most vitalizing of all elixirs, thus habitually
fed to them, should make the organs receiving it, or through which it
passes, beautiful, magnetic, graceful, radiant with life? Look at the
lips, eyes, cheeks of a happy bride and find your answer. Joy is the
greatest beautifier on earth and there is no joy like sex-joy. I
prophesy that when Karezza becomes the habit of the people, made easy
and perfect by inheritance developing into instinct, that the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

human race will become beautiful exceedingly, beyond the beauty of all
former times; a subtle, inward beauty, shining through. The sex-force,
which produces such rapture when felt locally, such a divine ecstasy
when diffused in Karezza, will be healing in the hands of the physician,
eloquence on the lips of the orator, fire in the eyes of the leader,
genius in the brain of the great.
