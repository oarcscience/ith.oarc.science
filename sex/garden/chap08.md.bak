## CHAPTER 8

### The Sundry Names Given to the Sexual Parts of Man

KNOW, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that man's member bears different
names, as:

El dekeur, the virile member *El fortass*, the bald one *El kamera*, the
penis *Abou aïne*, he with one eye *El aïr*, the member for generation
*El atsar*, the pusher *El hamama*, the pigeon *El dommar*, the
odd-headed *El teunnana*, the tinkler *Abou rokba*, the one with a neck
*El heurmak*, the indomitable *Abou quetaïa*, the hairy one *El ahlil*,
the liberator *El besiss*, the impudent one *El zeub*, the verge *El
mostahi*, the shame-faced one *El hammache*, the exciter *El nâsse*, the
sleeper *El bekkaï*, the weeping one *El zodamme*, the crowbar *El
hezzaz*, the rummager *El khiade*, the tailor *El lezzaz*, the unionist
*Mochefi el relil*, the extinguisher of passion *Abou lâaba*, the
expectorant *El fattache*, the searcher *El khorrate*, the turnabout *El
hakkak*, the rubber *El deukkak*, the striker *El mourekhi*, the flabby
one *El âouame*, the swimmer *El motelâ*, the ransacker *El dekhal*, the
housebreaker *El mokcheuf* the discoverer *El âouar*, the one-eyed

As regards the names of *kamera* and *dekeur*, their meaning is plain.
*Dekeur is a word* which signifies the male of all creatures, and is
also used in the sense of 'mention' and 'memory'. When a man has met
with an accident to his member, when it has been amputated, or has
become weak, and he can, in consequence, no longer fulfil his conjugal
duties, they say of him: 'the member of such an one is dead'; which
means: the remembrance of him will be lost, and his generation is cut
off by the root. When he dies they will say, 'His member has been cut
off,' meaning, 'His memory is departed from the world.'

The *dekeur* plays also an important part in dreams. The man who dreams
that his member has been cut off is certain not to live long after that
dream, for, as said above, it presages the loss of his memory and the
extinction of his race.

I shall treat this subject more particularly in the explication of
dreams. The teeth (*senane*) represent years (*senine*); if therefore a
man sees in a dream a fine set of teeth, this is for him the sign of
along life.

If he sees his nail (*defeur*) reversed or upside down, this is an
indication that the victory (*defeur*) which he has gained over his
enemies will change sides; and from a victor, he will become the
vanquished; inversely, if he sees the nail of his enemy turned the wrong
way, he can conclude that the victory which had been with his enemy will
soon return to him.

The sight of a lily (*sonsana*) is the prognostication of a misfortune
which will last a year (*son*, misfortune; *sena*, year).

The appearance of ostriches (*nâmate*) in dreams is of bad augury,
because their name being formed of *nâb* and *mate*, signifies 'news of
death,' namely, peril.

To dream of a shield (*henafa*) means the coming on of all sorts of
misfortune, for this word, by a change of letters, gives *koul afa*,
'all bad luck.'

The sight of a fresh rose (*ouarde*) announces the arrival (*ouroud*) of
a pleasure to make the heart tremble with joy; whilst a faded rose
indicates deceitful news. It is the same with baldness of the temples,
and similar things.

The jessamine (*yasmine*) is formed of *yas*, signifying deception, or
the happening of a thing contrary to your wish, and *mine*, which means
untruth. The man, then, who sees a jessamine in his dream is to conclude
that the deception, yas, in the name *yasmine*, is an untruth, and will
thus be assured of the success of his enterprise. However, the
prognostications furnished by the jessamine have not the same character
of certainty as those given by the rose. It differs, in fact, greatly
from this latter flower, inasmuch as the slightest breath of wind will
upset it.

The sight of a saucepan (*beurma*) announces the conclusion
(*anuberame*) of affairs in which one is engaged. Abou Djahel (God's
curse be upon him!) has added that such conclusion would take place
during the night.

A jar (*khabia*) is the sign of turpitude (*khebets*) in every kind of
affair, unless it is one that has fallen into a pit or a river and got
broken, so as to let escape all the calamities contained in it.

The sawing of wood (*nechara*) means good news (*bechara*).

The inkstand (*douaïa*) indicates the remedy (*doua*), namely, the cure
of a malady, unless it be burnt, broken or lost, when it means the
contrary.

The turban (*âmama*) if seen to fall over the face and cover the eyes is
a presage of blindness (*âina*), from which God preserve us!

The finding again in good condition a gem that has been lost or
forgotten is a sign of success.

If one dreams that he gets out of a window (*taga*) he may know that he
will come with advantage out of all transactions he may have, whether
important or not. But if the window seen in the dream is narrow so that
he had some trouble to get out of it, this will be to him a sign that in
order to be successful he will have to make efforts in proportion to the
difficulty experienced by him in getting out.

The bitter orange signifies that from the place where it was seen
calumnies will be issuing.

Trees (*achedjar*) means discussions (*mechadjera*).

The carrot (*asefnaria*) prognosticates misfortune (*asef*) and sorrow.

The turnip (*cufte*) means for the man that has seen it a matter that is
past and gone (*ameur fate*), so that there is no going back to it. The
matter is weighty if it appeared large, of no importance if seen small;
in short, important in proportion to the size of the turnip that has
been seen.

A musket seen without its being fired means a complot contrived in
secret, and of no importance. But if it is seen going off it is a sign
that the moment has arrived for the realisation of the complot.

The sight of fire is of bad augury.

If the pitcher (*brik*) of a man who has turned to God breaks, this is a
sign that his repentance is in vain, but if the glass out of which he
drinks wine breaks, this means that he returns to God.

If you have dreamed of feasts and sumptuous banquets, be sure that quite
contrary things will come to pass.

If you have seen somebody bidding adieu to people on their going away
you may be certain that it will be the latter who will shortly wish him
a good journey; for the poet says:

> If you have seen your friend saying goodbye, rejoice;  
> Let your soul be content as to him who is far away,  
> For you may look forward to his speedy return,  
> And the heart of him who said adieu will come back to you.

The coriander (*keusbeur*) signifies that the vulva (*keuss*) is in
proper condition.

On this subject there is a story that the Sultan Haroun er Rachid,
having with him several persons of mark with whom he was familiar, rose
and left them to go to one of his wives, whom he wanted to enjoy. He
found her suffering from her courses, and returned to his companions to
sit down with them, resigned to his disappointment.

Now it so happened that a moment afterwards the woman found herself free
from her discharge. When she had assured herself of this, she made
forthwith her ablutions, and sent to the Sultan, by one of her
negresses, a plate of coriander.

Haroun er Rachid was seated amongst his friends when the negress brought
the plate to him. He took it and examined it, but did not understand the
meaning of its being sent to him by his wife. At last he handed it to
one of his poets, who, having looked at it attentively, recited to him
the following verses:

>   
> 'She has sent you coriander  
> White as sugar;  
> I have placed it in my palm,  
> And concentrated all my thoughts upon it,  
> In order to find out its meaning;  
> And I have seized it.  
> O my master, what she wants to say,  
> Is, "My vulva is restored to health."'

Er Rachid was surprised at the wit shown by the woman, and at the poet's
penetration. Thus that which was to remain a mystery remained hidden,
and that which was to be known was divulged.

A drawn sword is a sign of war, and the victory will remain with him who
holds its hilt.

A bridle means servitude and oppression.

A long beard points to good fortune and prosperity; but it is said that
it is a sign of death if it reaches down to the ground.

Others pretend that the intelligence of each man is in an inverse
proportion to the length of his beard; that is to say, a big beard
denotes a small mind. A story goes in this respect, that a man who had a
long beard saw one day a book with the following sentence inscribed on
its back: 'He whose chin is garnished with a large beard is as foolish
as his beard is long.' Afraid of being taken for a fool by his
acquaintances, he thought of getting rid of what there was too much of,
and to this end, it being night-time, he grasped a handful of his beard
close to the chin, and set the remainder on fire by the light of the
lamp. The flame ran rapidly up the beard and reached his hand, which he
had to withdraw precipitately on account of the heat. Thus his beard was
burnt off entirely. Then he wrote on the back of the book, under the
above-mentioned sentence, 'These words are entirely true. I, who am now
writing this, have proved their truth.' Being himself convinced that the
weakness of the intellect is proportioned to the length of the beard.

On the same subject it is related that Haroun er Rachid, being in a
kiosk, saw a man with a long beard. He ordered the man to be brought
before him, and when he was there he asked him, 'What is your name?'

'Abou Arouba,' replied the man.

'What is your profession?'

'I am a master in controversy.'

Haroun then gave him the following case to solve. A man buys a he-goat,
who, in voiding his excrements, hits the buyer's eye with part of it and
injures the same. 'Who has to pay for damages?' 'The seller,' promptly
says Abou Arouba. 'And why?' asked the Caliph. 'Because he has sold the
animal without warning the buyer that it has a catapult in its anus,'
answered the man. At these words the Caliph began to laugh immoderately,
and recited the following verses:

> When the beard of the young man  
> Has grown down to his navel,  
> The shortness of his intellect is, in my eyes,  
> Proportioned to the length his beard has grown.

It is averred by many authors that amongst proper names there are such
as bring luck, and others that bring ill luck, according to the meaning
they bear.

The names Ahmed, Mohammed, Hamdonna and Hamdoun indicate in encounters
and in dreams the lucky issue arrived at in a transaction. Ali and Alia,
indicate the height and elevation of rank. Naserouna, Naseur, Mansour
and Naseur Allah signify triumph over enemies. Salem, Salema, Selim and
Selimane indicate success in all affairs; also security for him who is
in danger. Fetah Allah and Fetah indicate victory, like all the other
names which in their meaning speak of lucky things. The names Râd and
Râda signify thunder, tumult, and comprise everything in connection with
this meaning. Abou el Feurdj and Ferendj indicate joy; Ranem and Renime
success, Khalf Allah and Khaleuf compensation for a loss, and
benediction. The sense of Abder Rassi, Hafid and Mahfond is favourable.
The names in which are the words *latif* (benevolent), *mourits*
(helpful), *hanine* (compassionate) and *aziz* (beloved), carry with
them, in conformity with the sense of these words, the ideas of
benevolence, *lateuf* (charity), *iratsa* (compassion), *hanana*, and
*aiz* (favour). As an example of words of an unfavourable omen I will
cite *el ouar* and *el ouara*, which imply the idea of difficulties.

As supporting the truth of the preceding observations I will refer to
this saying of the Prophet (the salutation and benevolence of God to
him!), 'Compare the names appearing in your dreams with their
signification, so that you may draw therefrom your conclusions.'

I must confess that this was not the place for treating of this subject,
but one word leads on to more. I now return to the object of this
chapter, viz: the different names of the sexual parts of man.

The name *of el aïr* is derived from *el kir* (the smith's bellows). In
fact if you turn in the latter word the k, *kef*, so that it faces the
opposite way, you will find the word to read *el aïr*. The member is so
called on account of its alternate swelling and subsiding again. If
swollen up it stands erect, and if not it sinks down flaccid.

It is called *el hamama* (the pigeon), because after having been swelled
out it resembles at the moment when it returns to repose a pigeon
sitting on her eggs.

  
*El teunnana* (the tinkler)--So called because every time it enters or
comes out of the vulva in coition it makes a noise.

El heurmak (the indomitable)--It has received this name because when in
a state of erection it begins to move its head, searching for the
entrance to the *vulva* till it has found it, and it then walks in quite
insolently, without asking leave.

El ahlil (the liberator)--Thus called because in penetrating into the
vulva of a woman thrice repudiated it gives her the liberty to return to
her first husband.

El zeub (the verge)--From the word *deub*, which means creeping. This
name was given to the member because when it gets between a woman's
thighs and feels a plump vulva it begins to creep upon the thighs and
the Mount of Venus, then approaches the entrance of the vulva, and keeps
creeping in until it is in possession and is comfortably lodged, and
having it all its own way penetrates into the middle of the vulva, there
to ejaculate.

El hammache (the exciter)--It has received this name because it
irritates the vulva by its frequent entries and exits.

El nâasse (the sleeper)--From its deceitful appearance. When it gets
into erection, it lengthens out and stiffens itself to such an extent
that one might think it would never get soft again. But when it has left
the vulva, after having satisfied its passion, it goes to sleep.

There are members that fan asleep while inside the vulva, but the
majority of them come out still firm but at that moment they get drowsy,
and little by little they go to sleep.

El zoddame (the crowbar)--It is called so because when it meets the
vulva and the same will not let it pass in directly, it forces the
entrance with its head, breaking and tearing everything, like a wild
beast in the rutting season.

El khiade (the tailor)--It takes this name from the circumstance that it
does not enter the vulva until it has manoeuvred about the entrance,
like a needle in the hand of a tailor, creeping and rubbing against it
until it is sufficiently roused, after which it enters.

Mochefi el relil (the extinguisher of passion)--This name is given to a
member which is large, strong, and slow to ejaculate; such a member
satisfies most completely the amorous wishes of a woman; for, after
having wrought her up to the highest pitch, it allays her excitement
better than any other. And, in the same way, it calms the ardour of the
man. When it wants to get into the vulva, and arriving at the portal
finds it closed, it laments, begs and promises: 'Oh! my love! let me
come in, I will not stay long.' And when it has been admitted, it breaks
its word, and makes a long stay, and does not take its leave till it has
satisfied its ardour by the ejaculation of the sperm, coming and going,
tilting high and low, and rummaging right and left. The vulva protests,
'How about your word, you deceiver?' she says; 'you said you would only
stop in for a moment.' And the member answers, 'Oh, certainly! I shall
not retire till I have encountered your womb; but after having found it,
I will engage to withdraw at once.' At these words, the vulva takes pity
on him, and advances her matrix, which clasps and kisses its head, as if
saluting it. 'The member then retires with its passion cooled down.

El khorrate (the turnabout)--This name was given to it because on
arriving at the vulva it pretends to come on important business, knocks
at the door, turns about everywhere, without shame or bashfulness,
investigating every corner to the right and left, forward and backward,
and then all at once darts right to the bottom of the vagina for the
ejaculation.

El deukkak (the striker)--Thus called because on arriving at the
entrance of the vulva it gives a slight knock. If the vulva opens the
door, it enters; if there is no response, it begins to knock again, and
does not cease until it is admitted. The parasite who wants to get into
the house of a rich man to be present at a feast does the same: he
knocks at the door; and if it is opened, he walks in; but if there is no
response to his knock, he repeats it again and again until the door is
opened. And similarly the *deukkak* with the door of the vulva.

By 'knocking at the door' is meant the friction of the member against
the entrance of the vulva until the latter becomes moist. The appearance
of this moisture is the phenomenon alluded to by the expression 'opening
the door.

El âouame (the swimmer)--Because when it enters the vulva it does not
remain in one favourite place, but, on the contrary, turns to the right,
to the left, goes forward, draws back, and then moves like a swimmer in
the middle amongst its own sperm and the fluid furnished by the vulva,
as if in fear of drowning and trying to save itself.

El dekhal (the housebreaker)--Merits that name because on coming to the
door of the vulva this one asks, 'What do you want?' 'I want to come
in!' 'Impossible! I cannot take you in on account of your size.' Then
the member insists that the other one should only receive its head,
promising not to come in entirely; it then approaches, rubs its head
twice or thrice between the vulva's lips, till they get humid and thus
lubricated, then introduces first its head, and after, with one push,
plunges in up to the testicles.

El âouar (the one-eyed)--Because it has but one eye, which eye is not
like other eyes, and does not see clearly.

El fordyce (the bald one)--Because there is no hair on its head, which
makes it look bald.

Abou aïne (he with one eye)--It has received this name because it has
one eye which presents the peculiarity of being without pupil and
eyelashes.

El âtsar (the stumbler)--It is called so because if it wants to
penetrate into the vulva but does not see the door, it beats about above
and below, bind thus continues to stumble as over stones in the road,
until the lips of the vulva get humid, when it manages to get inside.
The vulva then says, What has happened to you that made you stumble
about so?' The member answers, 'O my love, it was a stone lying in the
road.'

El dommar (the odd-headed)--Because its head is different from all ether
heads.

Abou rokba (the one with a neck)--That is the being with a short neck, a
well-developed throat, thick at the end, and a bald head, and who,
moreover, has coarse and bristly hair from the navel to the pubis.

Abou quetaïa (the hairy one; who has a forest of hail)--This name is
given to it when the hair is abundant about it.

El besiss (the impudent one)--It has received this name because from the
moment that it gets stiff and long it does not care for anybody, lifts
impudently the clothing of its master by raising its head fiercely, and
makes him ashamed while itself feels no shame. It acts in the same
unabashed way with women, turning up their clothes and laying bare their
thighs. Its master may blush at this conduct, but as to itself its
stiffness and determination to plunge into a vulva only increase.

El mostahi (the shame-faced one)--This sort of member which is met with
sometimes, is capable of feeling ashamed and timid when facing a vulva
which it does not know, and it is only after a little time that it gets
bolder and stiffens. Sometimes it is even so much troubled that it
remains incompetent for the coitus, which happens in particular when a
stranger is present, in which case it becomes quite incapable of moving.

El bekkaï (the weeper)--So called on account of the many tears it sheds:
as soon as it gets m erection, it weeps; when it sees a pretty face, it
weeps; handling a woman, it weeps. It goes even so far as to weep tears
sacred to memory.

El hezzaz (the rummager)--It is named thus because as soon as it
penetrates into the vulva it begins to rummage about vigorously, until
it has appeased its passion.

El lezzaz (the unionist)--Received that name because as soon as it is in
the vulva it pushes and works till fur meets fur, and even makes efforts
to force the testicles into it.

Abou lâaba (the expectorant)--Has received this name because when coming
near a vulva, or when it sees one, or even when merely thinking of it,
or when its master touches a woman or plays with her or kisses her, its
saliva begins to move and it has tears in its eye; this saliva is
particularly abundant when it has been for some time out of work, and it
will even wet then his master's dress. This member is very common, and
there are but few people who are not furnished with it.

The liquid it sheds is cited by lawyers under the name of *medi*. Its
production is the result of toyings and of lascivious thoughts. With
some people it is so abundant as to fill the vulva, so that they
erroneously believe that it comes from the woman.

El fattache (the searcher)--From its habit, when in the vulva, of
turning in every direction as if in search of something; and that
something is the matrix. It will know no rest until it has found it.

El hakkak (the rubber)--It has got this name because it will not enter
the vagina until it has rubbed its head against the entrance and the
lower part of the belly. It is frequently mistaken for the next one.

El mourekhi (the flabby one)--This one can never get in because it is
too soft, and it is therefore content to rub its head against the
entrance to the vulva until it ejaculates. It gives no pleasure to
woman, but only inflames her passion without being able to satisfy it,
and makes cross and irritable.

El motelâ (the ransacker)--So named because it penetrates into the
unusual places, makes itself well acquainted with the state of vulvas,
and can distinguish their qualities and faults.

El mokcheuf (the discoverer)--Has been thus denominated because in
getting up and raising its head, it raises the vestments which hide it,
and uncovers its master's nudities, and because it is also not afraid to
lay bare the vulvas which it does not yet know, and to lift up the
clothes which cover them without shame. It is not accessible to any
sense of bashfulness, cares for nothing and respects nothing. Nothing
which concerns the coitus is strange to it; it has a profound knowledge
of vulvas state of humidity, freshness, dryness, rightness or warmth of
vulvas which it explores assiduously. There are, in fact, certain vulvas
o exquisite exterior, plump and fine outside, whose insides leave much
to wish for, and they give no pleasure, owing to their being not warm,
but very humid, and having other similar faults. It is for this reason
that the *mokcheuf* tries to find out about things concerning the
coitus, and received this name.

These are the principal names that have been given to the virile member
according to its qualities. Those who think that the number of these
names is not exhaustive can look for more; but I think I have given a
nomenclature long enough to satisfy my readers.

Women](chap09.md)
