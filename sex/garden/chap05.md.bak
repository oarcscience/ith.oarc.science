## CHAPTER 5

### Relating to the Act of Generation

Know, O Vizir (and God protect you!), that if you wish for coition, in
joining the woman you should not have your stomach loaded with food and
drink, only in that condition will your cohabitation be wholesome and
good. If your stomach is full, only harm can come of it to both of you;
you will have threatening symptoms of apoplexy and gout, and the least
evil that may result from it will be the inability of passing your
urine, or weakness of sight.

Let your stomach then be free from excessive food and drink, and you
need not apprehend any illness.

Before setting to work with your wife excite her with toying, so that
the copulation will finish to your mutual satisfaction.

Thus it will be well to play with her before you introduce your verge
and accomplish the cohabitation. You will excite her by kissing her
cheeks, sucking her lips and nibbling at her breasts. You will lavish
kisses on her navel and thighs, and titillate the lower parts. Bite at
her arms, and neglect no part of her body; cling close to her bosom, and
show her your love and submission. Interlace your legs with hers, and
press her in your arms, for, as the poet has said:

> Under her neck my right hand  
> Has served her for a cushion,  
> And to draw her to me  
> I have sent out my left hand,  
> Which bore her up as a bed.

When you are close to a woman, and you see her eyes getting dim, and
hear her, yearning for coition, heave deep sighs, then let your and her
yearning be joined into one, and let your lubricity rise to the highest
point; for this will be the moment most favourable to the game of love.
The pleasure which the woman then feels will be extreme; as for
yourself, you will cherish her all the more, and she will continue her
affection for you, for it has been said:

> If you see a woman heaving deep sighs, with her lips getting red and
> her eyes languishing, when her mouth half opens and her movements grow
> heedless; when she appears to be disposed to go to sleep, vacillating
> in her steps and prone to yawn, know that this is the moment for
> coition; and if you there and then make your way into her you will
> procure for her an unquestionable treat. You yourself will find the
> mouth of her womb clasping your article, which is undoubtedly the
> crowning pleasure for both, for this before everything begets
> affection and love.

The following precepts, coming from a profound connoisseur in love
affairs, are well known:

> Woman is like a fruit, which will not yield its sweetness until you
> rub it between your hands. Look at the basil plant; if you do not rub
> it warm with your fingers it will not emit any scent. Do you not know
> that the amber, unless it be handled and warmed, keeps hidden within
> its pores the aroma contained in it. It is the same with woman. If you
> do not animate her with your toying, intermixed with Kissing, nibbling
> and touching, you will not obtain from her what you are wishing; you
> will feel no enjoyment when you share her couch, and you will waken in
> her heart neither inclination nor affection, nor love for you; all her
> qualities will remain hidden.

It is reported that a man, having asked a woman what means were the most
likely to create affection in the female heart, with respect to the
pleasures of coition, received the following answer:

> O you who question me, those things which develop the taste for
> coition are the toyings and touches which precede it, and then the
> close embrace at the moment of ejaculation!

> Believe me, the kisses, nibblings, suction of the lips, the close
> embrace, the visits of the mouth to the nipples of the bosom, and the
> sipping of the fresh saliva, these are the things to render affection
> lasting.

> In acting thus, the two orgasms take place simultaneously, and
> enjoyment comes to the man and woman at the same moment. Then the man
> feels the womb grasping his member, which gives to each of them the
> most exquisite pleasure.

> This it is which gives birth to love, and if matters have not been
> managed this way the woman has not had her full share of pleasure, and
> the delights of the womb are wanting. Know that the woman will not
> feel her desires satisfied, and will not love her rider unless he is
> able to act up to her womb; but when the womb is made to enter into
> action she will feel the most violent love for her cavalier, even if
> he be unsightly in appearance.

> Then do all you can to provoke a simultaneous discharge of the two
> spermal fluids; herein lies the secret of love.

One of the savants who have occupied themselves with this subject has
thus related the confidences which one of them made to him:

> O you men, one and all, who are soliciting the love of woman and her
> affection, and who wish that sentiment in her heart to be of an
> enduring nature, toy with her previous to coition; prepare her for
> enjoyment, and neglect nothing to attain that end. Explore her with
> the greater assiduity, and, entirely occupied with her, let nothing
> else engage your thoughts. Do not let the moment propitious for
> pleasure pass away; that moment will be when you see her eyes humid,
> half open. Then go to work, but, remember, not till your kisses and
> toyings have taken effect.

> After you have got the woman into a proper state of excitement, O men!
> put your member into her, and, if you then observe the proper
> movements, she will experience a pleasure which will satisfy all her
> desires.

> Lie on her breast, rain kisses on her cheeks, and let not your member
> quit her vagina. Push for the mouth of her womb. This will crown your
> labour.

> If, by God's favour, you have found this delight, take good care not
> to withdraw your member, but let it remain there, and imbibe an
> endless pleasure! Listen to the sighs and heavy breathing of the
> woman. They witness the violence of the bliss you have given her.

> And after the enjoyment is over, and your amorous struggle has come to
> an end, be careful not to get up at once, but withdraw your member
> cautiously. Remain close to the woman, and lie down on the right side
> of the bed that witnessed your enjoyment. You will find this pleasant,
> and you will not be like a fellow who mounts the woman after the
> fashion of a mule, without any regard to refinement, and who, after
> the emission, hastens to get his member out and to rise. Avoid such
> manners, for they rob the woman of all her lasting delight.

In short, the true lover of coition will not fail to observe all that I
have recommended; for, from the observance of my recommendations will
result the pleasure of the woman, and these rules comprise everything
essential in that respect.

God has made everything for the best!
