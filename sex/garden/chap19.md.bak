## CHAPTER 19

### Instructions with Regard to Pregnancy and How the Gender of the Child That Is To Be Born May Be Known--that is to say, Knowledge of the Sex of the Foetus

Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that the certain indications of
pregnancy are the following: the dryness of the vulva immediately after
coitus, the inclination to stretch herself, accesses of somnolency,
heavy and profound sleep, the frequent contraction of the opening of the
vulva to such an extent that not even a *meroud* could penetrate, the
nipples of the breast becoming darker and, lastly, the most certain of
all marks is the cessation of menstruation.

If the woman remains always in good health from the time that her
pregnancy is certain, if she preserves the good looks of her face and a
clear complexion, if she does not become freckled, then it may be taken
as a sign that the child will be a boy.

The red colour of the nipples also points to a child of the male sex.
The strong development of the breasts, and bleeding from the nose, if it
comes from the right nostril, are signs of the same purport.

The signs pointing to the conception of a child of the female sex are
numerous. I will name them here: frequent indisposition during
pregnancy, pale complexion, spots and freckles, pains in the matrIx,
frequent nightmares, blackness of the nipples, a heavy feeling on the
left side, nasal haemorrhage on the same side.

If there is any doubt about the pregnancy, let the woman drink, on going
to bed, honey-water, and if then she has a feeling of heaviness in the
abdomen, it is a proof that she is with child. If the right side feels
heavier than the left one, it will be a boy. If the breasts are swelling
with milk, this is similarly a sign that the child she is bearing will
be of the male sex.

I have received this information from savants, and all the indications
are positive and tested.
