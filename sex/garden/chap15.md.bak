## CHAPTER 15

### Concerning the Causes of Impotence in Men

Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that there are men whose sperm is
vitiated by the inborn coldness of their nature, by diseases of their
organs, by purulent discharges, and by fevers. There are also men with
the urinary canal in their verge deviating owing to a downward curve;
the result of such conformation is that the seminal liquid cannot be
ejected in a straight direction, but falls downwards.

Other men have the member too short or too small to reach the neck of
the matrix, or their bladder is ulcerated, or they are affected by other
mixtures, which prevent them from coition.

Finally, there are men who arrive quicker at the crisis than women, in
consequence of which the two emissions are not simultaneous; there is in
such cases no conception.

All these circumstances serve to explain the absence of conception in
women; but the principal cause of all is the shortness of the virile
member.

As another cause of impotence may be regarded the sudden transmission
from hot to cold, and vice versa, and a great number of analogous
reasons.

Men whose impotence is due either to the corruption of their sperm owing
to their cold nature, or to maladies of the organs, or to discharges or
fevers and similar ills, or to their excessive promptness in
ejaculation, can be cured. They should eat stimulant pastry containing
honey, ginger, pyrether, syrup of vinegar, hellebore, garlic, cinnamon,
nutmeg, cardamoms, sparrows' tongues, Chinese cinnamon, long pepper, and
other spices. They will be cured by using them.

As to the other afflictions which we have indicated--the curvature of
the urethra, the small dimensions of the virile member, ulcers on the
bladder, and the other infirmities which are adverse to coition--God
only can cure them.
