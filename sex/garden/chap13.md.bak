## CHAPTER 13

### Concerning the Causes of Enjoyment in the Act of Generation

Know, O Vizir (to whom God be good!), that the causes which tend to
develop the passion for coition are six in number: the fire of an ardent
love, the superabundance of sperm, the proximity of the loved person
whose possession is eagerly desired, the beauty of the face, exciting
viands, and contact.

Know also, that the causes of the pleasure in cohabitation, and the
conditions of enjoyment are numerous, but that the principal and best
ones are: the heat of the vulva; the narrowness, dryness, and sweet
exhalation of the same. If any one of these conditions is absent, there
is at the same time something wanting in the voluptuous enjoyment. But
if the vagina unites the required qualifications, the enjoyment is
complete. In fact, a moist vulva relaxes the nerves, a cold one robs the
member of all its vigour, and bad exhalations from the vagina detract
greatly from the pleasure, as is also the case if the latter is very
wide.

The acme of enjoyment, which is produced by the abundance and impetuous
ejaculation of the sperm, depends upon one circumstance, and this is,
that the vulva is furnished with a suction-pump (orifice of the uterus),
which will clasp the virile member, and suck up the sperm with an
irresistible force. The member once seized by the orifice, the lover is
powerless to retain the sperm, for the orifice will not relax its hold
until it has extracted every drop of the sperm, and certainly if the
crisis arrives before this gripping of the gland takes place, the
pleasure of the ejaculation will not be complete.

Know that there are eight things which give strength to and favour the
ejaculation. These are: bodily health, the absence of all care and
worry, an unembarrassed mind, natural gaiety of spirit, good
nourishment, wealth, the variety of the faces of women, and the variety
of their complexions.

If you wish to acquire strength for coitus, take fruit of the mastic
tree (*derou*), pound them and macerate them with oil and honey; then
drink of the liquid first thing in the morning: you will thus become
vigorous for the coitus, and there will be abundance of sperm produced.

The same result will be obtained by rubbing the virile member and the
vulva with gall from the jackal. This rubbing stimulates those parts and
increases their vigour.

A savant of the name of Djelinouss has said: 'He who feels that he is
weak for coition should drink before going to bed a glassful of very
thick honey and eat twenty almonds and one hundred grains of the pine
tree. He must follow this regime for three days. He may also pound onion
seed, sift it and mix it afterwards with honey, stirring the mixture
well, and take of this mixture while still fasting.'

A man who would wish to acquire vigour for coition may likewise melt
down fat from the hump of a camel, and rub his member with it just
before the act; it will then perform wonders, and the woman will praise
it for its work.

If you would make the enjoyment still more voluptuous, masticate a
little cubeb-pepper or cardamom grains of the large species; put a
certain quantity of it upon the head of your member, and then go to work
This will procure for you, as well as for the woman, a matchless
enjoyment. The ointment from the balm of Judea or of Mecca produces a
similar effect.

If you would make yourself very strong for the coitus, pound very
carefully pyrether together with ginger, mix them while pounding with
ointment of lilac, then rub with this compound your abdomen, the
testicles, and the verge. This will make you ardent for coitus.

You will likewise predispose yourself for cohabitation, sensibly
increase the volume of your sperm, gain increased vigour for the action,
and procure for yourself extraordinary erections, by eating of
chrysocolla the size of a mustard grain. The excitement resulting from
the use of this nostrum is unparalleled, and all your qualifications for
coitus will be increased.

If you wish the woman to be inspired with a great desire to cohabit with
you, take a little of cubebs, pyrether, ginger and cinnamon, which you
will have to masticate just before joining her; then moisten your member
with your saliva and do her business for her. From that moment she will
have such an affection for you that she can scarcely be a moment without
you.

The virile member, rubbed with ass's milk, will become uncommonly strong
and vigorous.

Green peas, boiled carefully with onions, and powdered with cinnamon,
ginger and cardamoms, well pounded, create for the consumer considerable
amorous passion and strength in coitus.
