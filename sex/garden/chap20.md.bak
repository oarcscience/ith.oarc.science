## CHAPTER 20

### Forming the Conclusion of This Work, and Treating of the Good Effect of the Deglutition of Eggs as Favourable to the Coitus

Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that this chapter contains the most
useful instructions--how to increase the intensity of the coitus--and
that the latter part is profitable to read for an old man as well as for
the man in his best years and for the young man.

The Sheikh, who gives good advice to the creatures of God the Great! he
the sage, the savant, the first of the men of his time, speaks as
follows on this subject; listen then to his words:

He who makes it a practice to eat every day fasting the yolks of eggs,
without the white part, will find in this aliment an energetic stimulant
towards coitus. The same is the case with the man who during three days
eats of the same mixture with onions.

He who boils asparagus and then fries them in fat, and then pours upon
them the yolks of eggs with pounded condiments, and eats every day of
this dish, will grow very strong for the coitus, and find in it a
stimulant for his amorous desires.

He who peels onions, puts them into a saucepan, with condiments and
aromatic substances, and fries the mixture with oil and yolks of eggs,
will acquire a surpassing and invaluable vigour for the coitus, if he
will partake of this dish for several days.

Camel's milk mixed with honey and taken regularly develops a vigour for
copulation which is unaccountable and causes the virile member to be on
the alert night and day.

He who for several days makes his meals upon eggs boiled with myrrh,
coarse cinnamon, and pepper, will find his vigour with respect to
coition and erections greatly increased. He will have a feeling as
though his member would never return to a state of repose.

A man who wishes to copulate during a whole night, and whose desire,
having come on suddenly, will not allow him to prepare himself and
follow the regimen just mentioned, may have recourse to the following
recipe. He must get a great number of eggs, so that he may eat to
surfeit, and fry them with fresh fat and butter; when done he immerses
them in honey, working the whole mass well together. He must then eat of
them as much as possible with a little bread, and he may be certain that
for the whole night his member will not give him any rest.

On this subject the following verses have been composed:

> The member of Abou el Heïloukh has remained erect  
> For thirty days without a break, because he did eat onions.  
> Abou el Heïdja has deflowered in one night  
> Once eighty virgins, and he did not eat or drink between,  
> Because he'd surfeited himself first with chick-peas,  
> And had drunk camel's milk with honey mixed.  
> Mimoun, the negro, never ceased to spend his sperm while he  
> For fifty days without a truce the game was working.  
> How proud he was to finish such a task!  
> For ten days more he worked it, not was he yet surfeited,  
> But all this time he ate but yolk of eggs and bread.

The deeds of Abou el Heïloukli, Abou el Heïdja and Mimoun, just cited,
have been justly praised, and their history is truly marvellous. So I
will make you acquainted with it, please God, and thus complete the
signal services which this work is designed to render to humanity.

#### The History of Zohra

The Sheikh, the protector of religion (God, the Highest, be good to
him!), records, that there lived once in remote antiquity an illustrious
King, who had numerous armies and immense riches.

This King had seven daughters remarkable for their beauty and
perfections. These seven had been born one after another, without any
male infant between them.

The kings of the time wanted them in marriage, but they refused to be
married. They wore men's clothing, rode on magnificent horses covered
with gold-embroidered trappings, knew how to handle the sword and the
spear, and bore men down in single combat. Each of them possessed a
splendid palace with the servants and slaves necessary for such service,
for the preparation of meat and drink, and other necessities of that
kind.

Whenever a marriage-offer for one of them was presented to the King, he
never failed to consult with her about it; but they always answered,
That shall never be.'

Different conclusions were drawn from these refusals; some in a good
sense, some in a bad one.

For a long time no positive information could be gathered of the reasons
for this conduct, and the daughters persevered in acting in the same
manner until the death of their father. Then the oldest of them was
called upon to succeed him, and received the oath of fidelity from all
his subjects. This accession to the throne resounded through all the
countries.

The name of the eldest sister was Fouzel Djemal (the flower of (Beauty);
the second was called Soltana el Agmar (the queen of moons); the third,
Bediaat el Djemal (the incomparable in beauty); the fourth, Ouarda (the
rose); the fifth, Mahmouda (the praiseworthy); the sixth, Kamela (the
perfect); and, finally, the seventh, Zohra (the beauty).

Zohra, the youngest, was at the same time the most intelligent and
judicious.

She was passionately fond of the chase, and one day as she was riding
through the fields she met on her way a cavalier, who saluted her, and
she returned his salute; she had some twenty men in her service with
her. The cavalier thought it was the voice of a woman he had heard, but
as Zohra's face was covered by a flap of her haik, he was not certain,
and said to himself, 'I would like to know whether this is a woman or a
man. He asked one of the princess's servants, who dissipated his doubts.
Approaching Zohra, he then conversed pleasantly with her till they made
a halt for breakfast. He sat down near her to partake of the repast.

Disappointing the hopes of the cavalier, the princess did not uncover
her face, and, pleading that she was fasting, ate nothing. He could not
help admiring secretly her hand, the gracefulness of her waist' and the
amorous expression of her eyes. His heart was seized with a violent
love.

The following conversation took place between them:

THE CAVALIER: Is your heart insensible for friendship?

ZOHRA: It is not proper for a man to feel friendship for a woman; for if
their hearts once incline towards each other, libidinous desires will
soon invade them, and with Satan enticing them to do wrong, their fall
is soon known by everyone.

THE CAVALIER: It is not so, when the affection is true and their
intercourse pure without infidelity or treachery.

ZOHRA: If a woman gives way to the affection she feels for a man, she
becomes an object of slander for the whole world, and of general
contempt, whence nothing arises but trouble and regrets.

THE CAVALIER: But our love will remain secret, and in this retired spot,
which may serve us as our place of meeting, we shall have intercourse
together unknown to all.

ZOHRA: That may not be. Besides, it could not so easily be done, we
should soon be suspected, and the eyes of the whole world would be
turned upon us.

THE CAVALIER: But love, love is the source of life. The happiness, that
is, the meeting, the embraces, the caresses of lovers. The sacrifice of
the fortune, and even of the life for your love.

ZOHRA: These words are impregnated with love, and your smile is
seductive; but you would do better to refrain from similar conversation.

THE CAVALIER: Your word is emerald and your counsels are sincere. ut
love has now taken root in my heart, and no one is able to tear it out.
If you drive me from you I shall assuredly die.

ZOHRA: For all that you must return to your place and I to mine. If it
pleases God we shall meet again.

They then separated, bidding each other adieu, and returned each of them
to their dwelling.

The cavalier's name was Abou el Heïdja. His father, Kheiroun, was a
great merchant and immensely rich, whose habitation stood isolated
beyond the estate of the princess, a day's journey distant from her
castle. Abou el Heïdja returned home, could not rest, and put on again
his *temeur* when the night fell, took a black turban, and buckled his
sword on under his *temeur*. Then he mounted his horse, and, accompanied
by his favourite negro, Mimoun, he rode away secretly under the cover of
night.

They travelled all night without stopping until, on the approach of
daylight, the dawn came upon them in sight of Zohra's castle. They then
made a halt among the hills, and entered with their horses into a cavern
which they found there.

Abou el Heïdja left the negro in charge of the horses, and went in the
direction of the castle, in order to examine its approaches; he found it
surrounded by a very high wall. Not being able to get into it, he
retired to some distance to watch those who came out. But the whole day
passed away and he saw no one come out.

After sunset he sat himself down at the entrance of the cavern and kept
on the watch until midnight; then sleep overcame him.

He was lying asleep with his head on Mimoun's knee, when the latter
suddenly awakened him. 'What is it?' he asked. 'O my master,' said
Mimoun, 'I have heard some noise in the cavern, and I saw the glimmer of
a light.' He rose at once, and looking attentively, he perceived indeed
a light, towards which he went, and which guided him to a recess in the
cavern. Having ordered the negro to wait for him while he was going to
find out where it proceeded from, he took his sabre and penetrated
deeper into the cavern. He discovered a subterranean vault, into which
he descended.

The road to it was nearly impracticable, on account of the stones which
encumbered it. He contrived, however, after much trouble to reach a kind
of crevice, through which the light shone which he had perceived.
Looking through it, he saw the Princess Zohra, surrounded by about a
hundred virgins. They were in a magnificent palace dug out in the heart
of the mountain, splendidly furnished and resplendent with gold
everywhere. The maidens were eatIng and drinking and enjoying the
pleasures of the table.

Abou el Heïdja said to himself, 'Alas! I have no companion to assist me
at this difficult moment.' Under the influence of this reflection, he
returned to his servant, Mimoun, and said to him, 'Go to my brother
before God, Abou el Heïloukh, and tell him to come here to me as quickly
as he can.' The servant forthwith mounted upon his horse, and rode
through the remainder of the night.

Of all his friends, Abou el Heïloukh was the one whom Abou el Heïdja
liked best; he was the son of the Vizir. This young man and Abou el
Heïdja and the negro, Mimoun, passed as the three strongest and most
fearless men of their time, and no one ever succeeded in overcoming them
in combat.

When the negro Mimoun came to his master's friend, and had told him what
had happened, the latter said, 'Certainly, we belong to God and shall
return to him.' Then he took his sabre, mounted his horse, and taking
his favourite negro with him, he made his way, with Mimoun, to the
cavern.

Aboul el Heïdja came out to meet him and bid him welcome, and having
informed him of the love he bore to Zohra, he told him of his resolution
to penetrate forcibly into the palace, of the circumstances under which
he had taken refuge in the cavern, and the marvellous scene he had
witnessed while there. Abou el Heïloukh was dumb with surprise.

At nightfall they heard singing, boisterous laughter, and animated
talking. Abou el Heïdja said to his friend, 'Go to the end of the
subterranean passage and look. You will then make excuse for the love of
your brother.' Abou el Heïloukh, stealing softly down to the lower end
of the grotto, looked into the interior of the palace, and was enchanted
with the sight of these virgins and their charms. 'O brother,' he asked,
'which among these women is Zohra?'

Abou el Heïdja answered, 'The one with the irreproachable shape, whose
smile is irresistible, whose cheeks are roses, and whose forehead is
resplendently white, whose head is encircled by a crown of pearls, and
whose garments sparkle with gold. She is seated on a throne encrusted
with rare stones and nails of silver, and she is leaning her head upon
her hind.'

'I have observed her of all the others,' said Abou el Heïloukh, as
though she were a standard or a blazing torch. 'But, O my brother, let
me draw your attention to a matter which appears not to have struck
you.' 'What is it?' asked Abou el Heïdja. His friend replied, 'It is
very certain, O my brother, that licentiousness reigns in this palace.
Observe that these people come here only at night-time, and that this is
a retired place. There is every reason to believe that it is exclusively
consecrated to feasting, drinking, and debauchery, and if it was your
idea that you could have come to her you love by any other way than the
one on which we are now, you would have found that you had deceived
yourself, even if you had found means to communicate with her by the
help or other people.' 'And why so?' asked Abou el Heïdja. 'Because,'
said his friend, 'as far as I can see, Zohra solicits the affection of
young girls, which is a proof that she can have no inclination for men,
nor be responsive to their love.'

'O Abou el Heïloukh,' said Abou el Heïdja, 'I know the value of your
judgment, and it is for that I have sent for you. You know that I have
never hesitated to follow your advice and counsel!' 'O my brother,' said
the son of the Vizir, 'if God had not guided you to this entrance of the
palace you would never have been able to approach Zohra. But from here,
please God we can find our way.'

Next morning at sunrise, they ordered their servants to make a breach in
that place, and managed to get everything out of the way that could
obstruct the passage. This done they hid their horses in another cavern,
safe from wild beasts and thieves; then all the four, the two masters
and the two servants, entered the cavern and penetrated into the palace,
each of them armed with sabre and buckler. They then closed up again the
breach, and restored its former appearance.

Now they found themselves in darkness, but Abou el Heïloukh, having
struck a match, lighted one of the candles, and they began to explore
the palace in every sense. It seemed to them the marvel of marvels. The
furniture was magnificent. Everywhere there were beds and couches of all
kinds, rich candelabra, splendid lustres, sumptuous carpets, and tables
covered with dishes, fruits and beverages.

When they had admired all these treasures, they went on examining the
chambers, counting them. There was a great number of them, and in the
last one they found a secret door, very small, and of appearance which
attracted their attention. Abou el Heïloukh said, 'This is very probably
the door which communicates with the palace. Come, O my brother, we will
await the things that are to come in one of these chambers.' They took
their position in a cabinet difficult of access, high up, and from which
one could see without being seen.

So they waited till night came on. At that moment the secret door
opened, giving admission to a negress carrying a torch, who set alight
all the lustres and candelabra, arranged the beds, set the plates,
placed all sorts of meats upon the tables, with cups and bottles, and
perfumed the air with the sweetest scents.

Soon afterwards the maidens made their appearance. Their gait denoted at
the same time indifference and languor. They seated themselves upon the
divans, and the negress offered them meat and drink. They ate, drank,
and sang melodiously.

'Then the four men, seeing them giddy with wine, came down from their
hiding place with their sabres in their hands, brandishing them over the
heads of the maidens. They had first taken care to veil their faces with
the upper part of their *haïk*.

'Who are these men,' cried Zohra, 'who are invading our dwelling under
cover of the shades of the night? Have you risen out of the ground, or
did you descend from the sky? What do you want?'

'Coition!' they answered.

'With whom?' asked Zohra.

'With you, O apple of my eye!' said Abou el Heïdja, advancing.

Zohra: 'Who are you?'

'I am Abou el Heïdja.'

Zohra: 'But how is it you know me?'

'It is I who met you while out hunting at such and such a place.'

Zohra: 'But what brought you hither?'

'The will of God the Highest!'

At this answer Zohra was silent, and set herself to think of a means by
which she could rid herself of these intruders.

Now among the virgins that were present there were several whose vulvas
were like iron barred, and whom no one had been able to deflower; there
was also present a woman called Mouna (she who appeases the passion),
who was insatiable as regards coition. Zohra thought to herself, 'It is
only by a stratagem I can get rid of these men. By means of these women
I will set them tasks which they will be unable to accomplish as
conditions for my consent.' Then turning to Abou el Heïdja, she said to
him, 'You will not get possession of me unless you fulfil the conditions
which I shall impose upon you.' The four cavaliers at once consented to
this without knowing them, and she continued, 'But, if you do not fulfil
them, will you pledge your word that you will be my prisoners, and place
yourselves entirely at my disposition?' 'We pledge our words!' they
answered.

She made them take their oath that they would be faithful to their word,
and then, placing her hand in that of Abou el Heïdja, she said to him,
'As regards you, I impose upon you the task of deflowering eighty
virgins without ejaculating. Such is my will!' He answered, 'I accept.'

She let him then enter a chamber where there were several kinds of beds,
and sent to him the eighty virgins in succession. Abou el Heïdja
deflowered them all, and so ravished in a single night the maidenhood of
eighty young girls without ejaculating the smallest drop of sperm. This
extraordinary vigour filled Zohra with astonishment, and likewise all
those who were present.

The princess, turning then to the negro Mimoun, asked, 'And this one,
what is his name?' They said, 'Mimoun.' 'Your task shall be,' said the
princess, pointing to Mouna, 'to do this woman's business without
resting for fifty consecutive days; you need not ejaculate unless you
like; but if the excess of fatigue forces you to stop, you will not have
fulfilled your obligations.' They all cried out at the hardness of such
a task; but Mimoun protested, and said, 'I accept the condition, and
shall come out of it with honour!' The fact was that this negro had an
insatiable appetite for the coitus. Zohra told him to go with Mouna to
her chamber, impressing upon the latter to let her know if the negro
should exhibit the slightest trace of fatigue.

'And you, what is your name?' she asked the friend of Abou el Heïdja.
'Abou el Heïloukh,' he replied. 'Well, then, Abou el Heïloukh, what I
require of you is to remain here, in the presence of these women and
virgins, for fifty consecutive days with your member during this period
always in erection during day and night.'

Then she said to the fourth, 'What is your name?'

'Felah' (good fortune), was his answer. 'Very well, Felah,' she said,
'you will remain at our disposition for any services which we may have
to demand of you.'

However, Zohra, in order to leave no motive for any excuse, and so that
she might not be accused of bad faith, had asked them, first of all,
what regimen they wished to follow during the period of their trial.
Aboul el Heïdja had asked for only one drink--excepting water--camel's
milk with honey, and, for nourishment, chick-peas cooked with meat and
abundance of onions; and, by means of these aliments he did, by the
permission of God, accomplish his remarkable exploit. Abou el Heïloukh
demanded, for his nourishment, onions cooked with meat, and, for drink,
the juice pressed out of pounded onions mixed with honey. Mimoun, on his
part, asked for yolks of eggs and bread.

However, Abou el Heïdja claimed of Zohra the favour of copulating with
her on the strength of the fact that he had fulfilled his engagement.
She answered him, 'Oh, impossible! the condition which you have
fulfilled is inseparable from those which your companions have to comply
with. The agreement must be carried out in its entirety, and you will
find me true to my promise. But if one amongst you should fail in his
task, you will all be my prisoners by the will of God!'

Abou el Heïdja gave way in the face of this firm resolve, and sat down
amongst the girls and women, and ate and drank with them, whilst waiting
for the conclusion of the tasks of his companions.

At first Zohra, feeling convinced that they would soon all be at her
mercy, was all amiability and smiles. But when the twentieth day had
come she began to show signs of distress; and on the thirtieth she could
no longer restrain her tears. For on that day Abou el Heïloukh had
finished his task, and, having come out of it honourably, he took his
seat by the side of his friend amongst the company, who continued to eat
tranquilly and to drink abundantly.

From that time the princess, who had now no other hope than in the
failure of the negro Mimoun, relied upon his becoming fatigued before he
finished his work. She sent every day to Mouna for information, who sent
word that the negro's vigour was constantly increasing, and she began to
despair, seeing already Abou el Heïdja and Abou el Heïloukh coming off
as victors in their enterprises. One day she said to the two friends, 'I
have made inquiries about the negro, and Mouna has let me know that he
is exhausted with fatigue.' At these words Abou el Heïdja cried, 'In the
name of God! if he does not carry out his task, aye, and if he does not
go beyond it for ten days longer, he shall die the vilest of deaths!'

But his zealous servant never during the period of fifty days took any
rest in his work of copulation, and kept going on, besides, for ten days
longer, as ordered by his master. Mouna, on her part, had the greatest
satisfaction, as this feat had at last appeased her ardour for coition.
Mimoun, having remained victor, could then take his seat with his
companions.

Then said Abou el Heïdja to Zohra. 'See, we have fulfilled all the
conditions you have imposed upon us. It is now for you to accord me the
favours which, according to our agreement, were to be the price if we
succeeded.' 'it is but too true!' answered the princess, and she gave
herself up to him, and he found her excelling the most excellent.

As to the negro, Mimoun, he married Mouna. Abou el Heïloukh chose,
amongst all the virgins, the one whom he had found most attractive.

They all remained in the palace, giving themselves up to good cheer and
all possible pleasures, until death put an end to their happy existence
and dissolved their union. God be merciful to them as well as to all
Mussulmans! Amen!

It is to this stop that the verses cited previously make allusion. I
have given it here, because it testifies to the efficacy of the dishes
and remedies, the use of which I have recommended, for giving vigour for
coition, and all learned men agree in acknowledging their salutary
effects.

There are still other beverages of excellent virtue. I will describe the
following: Take one part of the juice pressed out of pounded onions, and
mix it with two parts of purified honey. Heat the mixture over a fire
until the onion juice has disappeared and the honey only remains. Then
take the residue front the fire, let it get cool, and preserve it for
use when wanted. Then mix of the same one *aoukia* with three *aouak* of
water, and let chick-peas be macerated in this fluid for one day and one
night.

This beverage is to be partaken of during winter and on going to bed.
Only a small quantity is to be taken, and only for one day. The member
or him who has drunk of it will not give him much rest during the night
that follows. As to the man who partakes of it for several consecutive
days, he will constantly have his member rigid and upright without
intermission. A man with an ardent temperament ought not to make use of
it, as it may give him a fever. Nor should the medicine be used three
days in succession except by old or cold-tempered men. And lastly, it
should not be resorted to in summer.

> I certainly did wrong to put this book together;  
> But you will pardon me, nor let me pray in vain,  
> O God! award no punishment for this on judgment day!  
> And thou, oh reader, hear me conjure thee to say:

> So be it!
