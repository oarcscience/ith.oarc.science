<I><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Concerning the Causes of Impotence in Men</H3>
</I><P>Know, O Vizir (God be good to you!), that there are men whose sperm is vitiated by the inborn coldness of their nature, by diseases of their organs, by purulent discharges, and by fevers. There are also men with the urinary canal in their verge deviating owing to a downward curve; the result of such conformation is that the seminal liquid cannot be ejected in a straight direction, but falls downwards.</P>
<P>Other men have the member too short or too small to reach the neck of the matrix, or their bladder is ulcerated, or they are affected by other mixtures, which prevent them from coition.</P>
<P>Finally, there are men who arrive quicker at the crisis than women, in consequence of which the two emissions are not simultaneous; there is in such cases no conception.</P>
<P>All these circumstances serve to explain the absence of conception in women; but the principal cause of all is the shortness of the virile member.</P>
<P>As another cause of impotence may be regarded the sudden transmission from hot to cold, and vice versa, and a great number of analogous reasons.</P>
<P>Men whose impotence is due either to the corruption of their sperm owing to their cold nature, or to maladies of the organs, or to discharges or fevers and similar ills, or to their excessive promptness in ejaculation, can be cured. They should eat stimulant pastry containing honey, ginger, pyrether, syrup of vinegar, hellebore, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamoms, sparrows' tongues, Chinese cinnamon, long pepper, and other spices. They will be cured by using them.</P>
<P>As to the other afflictions which we have indicated--the curvature of the urethra, the small dimensions of the virile member, ulcers on the bladder, and the other infirmities which are adverse to coition--God only can cure them.</P>
