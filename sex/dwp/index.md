# A DISCOURSE ON THE WORSHIP OF PRIAPUS

## RICHARD PAYNE KNIGHT

#### \[1786\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This extended essay on fertility worship in the Classical period was
written by Robert Payne Knight (1750-1820), a distinguished English
scholar, parlimentarian, writer, and antiquarian. Published in 1786,
this book shocked English society to such an extent that Knight took it
upon himself to surpress his own book. Subsequently this became a very
rare book until it was republished in several editions in the
mid-twentieth century. Although the study of the history of religion has
vastly advanced since Knight's day, this was one of the first books to
deal with the issue of sexuality and religion.

Production notes: Thanks to Eliza Fegley at [Sacred
Spiral](https://www.sacredspiral.com/.md) for proofing the body of this
text. To reduce bandwidth usage, I've broken the main body of the text
down into somewhat arbitrary sections. The 'Parts' do not occur in the
original book. In addition, the typesetter of the edition I used
apparently did not know Greek, and consistently confused 'upsilon' and
'nu'. I've corrected these errors where I spotted them.
