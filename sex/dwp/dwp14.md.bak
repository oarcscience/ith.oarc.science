# PART XIII

The Christian religion, being a reformation of the Jewish, rather
increased than diminished the austerity of its original. On particular
occasions however it equally abated its rigour, and gave way to
festivity and mirth, though always with an air of sanctity and
solemnity. Such were originally the feasts of the Eucharist, which, as
the word expresses, were meetings of joy and gratulation; though, as
divines tell us, all of the spiritual kind: but the particular manner in
which St. Augustine commands the ladies who attended them to wear clean
linen, <span id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_340.md) seems to infer, that
personal as well as spiritual matters were thought worthy of attention.
To those who administer the sacrament in the modern way, it may appear
of little consequence whether the women received it in clean linen or
not; but to the good bishop, who was to administer the *holy kiss*, it
certainly was of some importance. The *holy kiss* was not only applied
as a part of the ceremonial of the Eucharist, but also of prayer, at the
conclusion of which they welcomed each other with this natural sign of
love and benevolence. <span id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_341.md) It was upon
these occasions that

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

they worked themselves up to those fits of rapture and enthusiasm, which
made them eagerly rush upon destruction in the fury of their zeal to
obtain the crown of martyrdom. <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_342.md)
Enthusiasm on one subject naturally produces enthusiasm on another; for
the human passions, like the strings of an instrument, vibrate to the
motions of each other: hence paroxysms of love and devotion have
oftentimes so exactly accorded, as not to have been distinguished by the
very persons whom they agitated. <span id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_343.md)
This was too often the case in these meetings of the primitive
Christians. The feasts of gratulation and love, the αγαπαι and nocturnal
vigils, gave too flattering opportunities to the passions and appetites
of men, to continue long, what we are told they were at first, pure
exercises of devotion. The spiritual raptures and divine ecstasies
encouraged on these occasions, were often ecstasies of a very different
kind, concealed under the garb of devotion; whence the greatest
irregularities ensued; and it became necessary for the reputation of the
church, that they should be suppressed, as they afterwards were by the
decrees of several councils. Their suppression may be considered as the
final subversion of that part of the ancient religion

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

which I have here undertaken to examine; for so long as those nocturnal
meetings were preserved, it certainly existed, though under other names,
and in a more solemn dress. The small remain of it preserved at Isernia,
of which an account has here been given, can scarcely be deemed an
exception; for its meaning was unknown to those who celebrated it; and
the obscurity of the place, added to the venerable names of S. Cosimo
and Damiano, was all that presented it from being suppressed long ago,
as it has been lately, to the great dismay of the chaste matrons and
pious monks of Isernia. Traces and memorials of it seem however to have
been preserved, in many parts of Christendom, long after the actual
celebration of its rites ceased. Hence the obscene figures observable
upon many of our Gothic Cathedrals, and particularly upon the ancient
brass doors of St. Peter's at Rome, where there are some groups which
rival the devices on the Lesbian medals.
