# PART XIV

It is curious, in looking back through the annals of superstition, so
degrading to the pride of man, to trace the progress of the human mind
in different ages, climates, and circumstances, uniformly acting upon
the same principles, and to the same ends. The sketch here given of the
corruptions of the religion of Greece, is an exact counterpart of the
history of the corruptions of Christianity, which began in the pure

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

theism of the eclectic Jews, <span id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) and
by the help of inspirations, emanations, and canonizations, expanded
itself, by degrees, to the vast and unwieldly system which now fills the
creed of what is commonly called the Catholic Church. In the ancient
religion, however, the emanations assumed the appearance of moral
virtues and physical attributes, instead of ministering spirits and
guardian angels; and the canonizations or deifications were bestowed
upon heroes, legislators, and monarchs, instead of priests, monks, and
martyrs. There is also this further difference, that among the moderns
philosophy has improved, as religion has been corrupted; whereas, among
the ancients, religion and philosophy declined together. The true solar
system was taught in the Orphic school, and adopted by the Pythagoreans,
the next regularly-established sect. The Stoics corrupted it a little,
by placing the earth in the centre of the universe, though they still
allowed the sun its superior magnitude. <span
id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) At length arose the Epicureans, who
confounded it entirely, maintaining that the sun was only a small globe
of fire, a few inches in diameter,

and the stars little transitory lights, whirled about in the atmosphere
of the earth. <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_346.md)

How ill soever adapted the ancient system of emanations was to procure
eternal happiness, it was certainly extremely well calculated to produce
temporal good; for, by the endless multiplication of subordinate
deities, it effectually excluded two of the greatest curses that ever
afflicted the human race, dogmatical theology, and its consequent
religious persecution. Far from supposing that the gods known in their
own country were the only ones existing, the Greeks thought that
innumerable emanations of the divine mind were diffused through every
part of the universe; so that new objects of devotion presented
themselves wherever they went. Every mountain, spring, and river, had
its tutelary deity, besides the numbers of immortal spirits that were
supposed to wander in the air, scattering dreams and visions, and
superintending the affairs of men.

Τρις γαζ μυριοι εισιν επι χθονι πουλϋ Βοτειρη  
Αθανατοι Ζηνος, φυλαχες θνητων ανθρωπων. <span
id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_347.md)

An adequate knowledge of these they never presumed to think attainable,
but modestly contented

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

themselves with revering and invoking them whenever they felt or wanted
their assistance. When a shipwrecked mariner was cast upon an unknown
coast, he immediately offered up his prayers to the gods of the country,
whoever they were; and joined the inhabitants in whatever rites they
thought proper to propitiate them with. <span
id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_348.md) Impious or prophane rites he never
imagined could exist, concluding that all expressions of gratitude and
submission must be pleasing to the gods. Atheism was, indeed, punished
at Athens, as the obscene ceremonies of the Bacchanalians were at Rome;
but both as civil crimes against the state; the one tending to weaken
the bands of society by destroying the sanctity of oaths, and the other
to subvert that decency and gravity of manners, upon which the Romans so
much prided themselves. The introduction of strange gods, without
permission from the magistrate, was also prohibited in both cities; but
the restriction extended no farther than the walls, there being no other
parts of the Roman empire, except Judea, in which any kind of impiety or
extravagance might not have been maintained with impunity, provided it
was maintained merely as a speculative opinion, and not employed as

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

an engine of faction, ambition, or oppression. The Romans even carried
their condescension so far as to enforce the observance of a dogmatical
religion, where they found it before established; as appears from the
conduct of their magistrates in Judea, relative to Christ and his
apostles; and from what Josephus has related, of a Roman soldier's being
punished with death by his commander for insulting the Books of Moses.
Upon what principle then did they act, when they afterwards persecuted
the Christians with so much rancour and cruelty? Perhaps it may surprise
persons not used to the study of ecclesiastical antiquities, to be told
(what is nevertheless indisputably true) that the Christians were never
persecuted on account of the speculative opinions of individuals, but
either for civil crimes laid to their charge, or for withdrawing their
allegiance from the state, and joining in a federative union dangerous
by its constitution, and rendered still more dangerous by the intolerant
principles of its members, who often tumultuously interrupted the public
worship, and continually railed against the national religion (with
which both the civil government and military discipline of the Romans
were inseparably connected), as the certain means of eternal damnation.
To break this union, was the great object of Roman policy during a long
course of years; but the

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

violent means employed only tended to cement it closer. Some of the
Christians themselves indeed, who were addicted to Platonism, took a
safer method to dissolve it; but they were too few in number to succeed.
This was by trying to moderate the furious zeal which gave life and
vigour to the confederacy, and to blend and soften the unyielding temper
of religion with the mild spirit of philosophy. "We all," said they,
"agree in worshipping one supreme God, the Father and Preserver of all.
While we approach him with purity of mind, sincerity of heart, and
innocence of manners, forms and ceremonies of worship are indifferent;
and not less worthy of his greatness, for being varied and diversified
according to the various customs and opinions of men. Had it been his
will that all should have worshipped him in the same mode, he would have
given to all the same inclinations and conceptions: but he has wisely
ordered it otherwise, that piety and virtue might increase by an honest
emulation of religions, as industry in trade, or activity in a race,
from the mutual emulation of the candidates for wealth and
honour." <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_349.md) This was too liberal and
extensive a plan, to meet the approbation of a greedy and ambitious
clergy, whose object was to establish a hierarchy for themselves,

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

rather than to procure happiness for others. It was accordingly
condemned with vehemence and success by Ambrosius, Prudentius, and other
orthodox leaders of the age.

It was from the ancient system of emanations, that the general
hospitality which characterised the manners of the heroic ages, and
which is so beautifully represented in the *Odyssey* of Homer, in a
great measure arose. The poor, and the stranger who wandered in the
street and begged at the door, were supposed to be animated by a portion
of the same divine spirit which sustained the great and powerful. *They
are all from Jupiter*, says Homer, *and a small gift is
acceptable*. <span id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_350.md) This benevolent
sentiment has been compared by the English commentators to that of the
Jewish moralist, who says, *that he who giveth to the poor lendeth to
the Lord, who will repay him tenfold*. <span
id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_351.md) But it is scarcely possible for anything
to be more different: Homer promises no other reward for charity than
the benevolence of the action itself; but the Israelite holds out that
which has always been the great motive for charity among his
countrymen--the prospect of being repaid ten-fold. They are always ready
to show their bounty upon such incentives,

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

if they can be persuaded that they are founded upon good security. It
was the opinion, however, of many of the most learned among the
ancients, that the principles of the Jewish religion were originally the
same as those of the Greek, and that their God was no other than the
creator and generator Bacchus, <span id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_352.md)
who, being viewed through the gloomy medium of the hierarchy, appeared
to them a jealous and irascible God; and so gave a more austere and
unsociable form to their devotion. The golden vine preserved in the
temple at Jerusalem, <span id="fr_354"></span>[2](#fn_353.md) and the
taurine forms of the cherubs, between which the Deity was supposed to
reside, were symbols so exactly similar to their own, that they
naturally concluded them meant to express the same ideas; especially as
there was nothing in the avowed principles of the Jewish worship to
which they could be applied. The ineffable name also, which, according
to the Massorethic punctuation, is pronounced *Jehovah*, was anciently
pronounced *Jaho*, Ιαω, or Ιευω, <span id="fr_355"></span>[3](#fn_354.md)
which was a title of Bacchus, the nocturnal sun; <span
id="fr_356"></span>[4](#fn_355.md) as was

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

also *Sabazius*, or *Sabadius*, <span id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_356.md)
which is the same word as *Sabbaoth*, one of the scriptural titles of
the true God, only adapted to the pronunciation of a more polished
language. The Latin name for the Supreme God belongs also to the same
root; Ιυ-πατηρ, Jupiter, signifying Father Ιευ, though written after the
ancient manner, without the dipthong, which was not in use for many ages
after the Greek colonies settled in Latium, and introduced the Arcadian
alphabet. We find St. Paul likewise acknowledging, that the Jupiter of
the poet Aratus was the God whom he adored; <span
id="fr_358"></span>[2](#fn_357.md) and Clemens of Alexandria explains St.
Peter's prohibition of worshipping after the manner of the Greeks, not
to mean a prohibition of worshipping the same God, but merely of the
corrupt mode in which he was then worshipped. <span
