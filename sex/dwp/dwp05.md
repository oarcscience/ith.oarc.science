# PART IV

The fauns and satyrs, which accompany the androgynous figures on the
ancient sculptures, are usually represented as ministering to the
Creator by exerting their characteristic attributes upon them, as well
as upon the nymphs, the passive agents of procreation:

PLATE X  
SYSTRUM, WITH VARIOUS MEDALS

 

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

but what has puzzled the learned in these monuments, and seems a
contradiction to the general system of ancient religion, is that many of
these groups are in attitudes which are rather adapted to the
gratification of disordered and unnatural appetites, than to extend
procreation. But a learned author, who has thrown infinite light upon
these subjects, has effectually cleared them from this suspicion, by
showing that they only took the most convenient way to get at the female
organs of generation, in those mixed beings who possessed both. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97.md) This is confirmed by Lucretius, who
asserts, that this attitude is better adapted to the purposes of
generation than any other. <span id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_98.md) We may
therefore conclude, that instead of representing them in the act of
gratifying any disorderly appetites, the artists meant to show their
modesty in not indulging their concupiscence, but in doing their duty in
the way best adapted to answer the ends proposed by the Creator.

On the Greek medals, where the cow is the symbol of the deity, she is
frequently represented licking a calf, which is sucking her. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_99.md) This is probably meant to show that the
creative power cherishes and nourishes,

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

as well as generates; for, as all quadrupeds lick their young, to
refresh and invigorate them immediately after birth, it is natural to
suppose, according to the general system of symbolical writing, that
this action should be taken as an emblem of the effect it was thought to
produce. On other medals the bull or cow is represented licking
itself; <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) which, upon the same
principle, must represent the strength of the deity refreshed and
invigorated by the exertion of its own nutritive and plastic power upon
its own being. On others again is a human head of an androgynous
character, like that of the Bacchus διφυης, with the tongue extended
over the lower lip, as if to lick something. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_101.md) This was probably the same symbol,
expressed in a less explicit manner; it being the common practice of the
Greek artists to make a part of a composition signify the whole, of
which I shall soon have occasion to give some incontestable examples. On
a Parian medal published by Goltzius, the bull licking himself is
represented on one side, accompanied by the asterisk of the sun, and on
the other, the head with the tongue extended, having serpents, the
emblems of life, for hair. <span id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_102.md) The
same medal is in

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

my collection, except that the serpents are not attached to the head,
but placed by it as distinct symbols, and that the animal licking itself
is a female accompanied by the initial of the word Θεος, instead of the
asterisk of the sun. Antiquarians have called this head a Medusa; but,
had they examined it attentively on any well-preserved coin, they would
have found that the expression of the features means lust, and not rage
or horror. <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md) The case is, that
antiquarians have been continually led into error, by seeking for
explanations of the devices on the Greek medals in the wild and
capricious stories of Ovid's *Metamorphoses*, instead of examining the
first principles of ancient religion contained in the Orphic Fragments,
the writings of Plutarch, Macrobius, and Apuleius, and the Choral Odes
of the Greek tragedies. These principles were the subjects of the
ancient mysteries, and it is to these that the symbols on the medals
always relate; for they were the public acts of the states, and
therefore contain the sense of nations, and not the caprices of
individuals.

As M. D'Hancarville found a complete representation of the bull breaking
the egg of chaos in the sculptures of the Japanese, when only a part of
it appears n the Greek monuments; so we may find in a curious

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Oriental fragment, lately brought from the
sacred caverns of Elephanta, near Bombay, a complete representation of
the symbol so enigmatically expressed by the head above mentioned. These
caverns are ancient places of worship, hewn in the solid rock with
immense labour and difficulty. That from which the fragment in question
was brought, is 130 feet long by 110 wide, adorned with columns and
sculptures finished in a style very different from that of the Indian
artists. <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md) It is now neglected; but
others of the same kind are still used as places of worship by the
Hindoos, who can give no account of the antiquity of them, which must
necessarily be very remote, for the Hindoos are a very ancient people;
and yet the sculptures represent a race of men very unlike them, or any
of the present inhabitants of India. A specimen of these was brought
from the island of Elephanta, in the Cumberland man-of-war, and now
belongs to the museum of Mr. Townley. It contains several figures, in
very high relief; the principal of which are a man and woman, in an
attitude which I shall not venture to describe, but only observe, that
the action, which I have supposed to be a symbol of refreshment and
invigoration, is mutually applied by both to their respective organs of

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

generation, <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) the emblems of the
active and passive powers of procreation, which mutually cherish and
invigorate each other.

The Hindoos still represent the creative powers of the deity by these
ancient symbols, the male and female organs of generation; and worship
them with the same pious reverence as the Greeks and Egyptians
did. <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md) Like them too they have
buried the original principles of their theology under a mass of
poetical mythology, so that few of them can give any more perfect
account of their faith, than that they mean to worship one first cause,
to whom the subordinate deities are merely agents, or more properly
personified modes of action. <span id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_107.md) This
is the doctrine inculcated, and very fully explained, in the *Bagvat
Geeta*; a moral and metaphysical work lately translated from the
Sanscrit language, and said to have been written upwards of four
thousand years ago. Kreshna, or the deity become incarnate in the shape
of man, in order to instruct all mankind, is introduced, revealing to
his disciples the fundamental principles of true faith, religion, and
wisdom; which are the exact counterpart of the system of emanations, so
beautifully described in the lines of

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Virgil before cited. We here find, though in a
more mystic garb, the same one principle of life universally emanated
and expanded, and ever partially returning to be again absorbed in the
infinite abyss of intellectual being. This reabsorption, which is
throughout recommended as the ultimate end of human perfection, can only
be obtained by a life of inward meditation and abstract thought, too
steady to be interrupted by any worldly incidents, or disturbed by any
transitory affections, whether of mind or body. But as such a life is
not in the power of any but a Brahman, inferior rewards, consisting of
gradual advancements during the transmigrations of the soul, are held
out to the soldier, the husbandman, and mechanic, accordingly as they
fulfill the duties of their several stations. Even those who serve other
gods are not excluded from the benefits awarded to every moral virtue;
for, as the divine Teacher says, *If they do it with a firm belief, in
so doing they involuntarily worship even me. I am he who partaketh of
all worship, and I am their reward*. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) This universal deity, being the cause of
all motion, is alike the cause of creation, preservation, and
destruction; which three attributes are all expressed in the mystic
syllable *om*. To repeat this in silence, with firm

PLATE XI  
SCULPTURE FROM ELEPHANTA

 

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

devotion, and immoveable attention, is the surest means of
perfection, <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) and consequent
reabsorption, since it leads to the contemplation of the Deity, in his
three great characteristic attributes.

The first and greatest of these, the creative or generative attribute,
seems to have been originally represented by the union of the male and
female organs of generation, which, under the title of the *Lingam*,
still occupies the central and most interior recesses of their temples
or pagodas; and is also worn, attached to bracelets, round their necks
and arms. <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_110.md) In a little portable
temple brought from the Rohilla country during the late war, and now in
the British Museum, this composition appears mounted on a pedestal, in
the midst of a square area, sunk in a block of white alabaster. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_111.md) Round the pedestal is a serpent, the
emblem of life, with his head rested upon his tail, to denote eternity,
or the constant return of time upon itself, whilst it flows through
perpetual duration, in regular revolutions and stated periods. From
under the body of the serpent springs the lotus or water lily, the
Nelumbo of Linnæus, which overspreads the whole of the area not occupied
by the figures at the corners. This plant grows

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

in the water, and, amongst its broad leaves, puts forth a flower, in the
center of which is formed the seed-vessel, shaped like a bell or
inverted cone, and punctuated on the top with little cavities or cells,
in which the seeds grow. <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) The
orifices of these cells being too small to let the seeds drop out when
ripe, they shoot forth into new plants, in the places where they were
formed; the bulb of the vessel serving as a matrice to nourish them,
until they acquire such a degree of magnitude as to burst it open and
release themselves; after which, like other aquatic weeds, they take
root wherever the current deposits them. This plant therefore, being
thus productive of itself, and vegetating from its own matrice, without
being fostered in the earth, was naturally adopted as the symbol of the
productive power of the waters, upon which the active spirit of the
creator operated in giving life and vegetation to matter. We accordingly
find it employed in every part of the northern hemisphere, where the
symbolical religion, improperly called idolatry, does or ever did
prevail. The sacred images of the Tartars, Japonese, and Indians, are
almost all placed upon it; of which numerous instances occur in the
publications of Kæmpfer, Chappe D'Auteroche, and Sonnerat. The upper
part of the

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

base of the *Lingam* also consists of this flower, blended and composed
with the female organ of generation which it supports: and the ancient
author of the *Bagvat Geeta* speaks of the creator Brahma as sitting
upon his lotus throne. <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) The figures
of Isis, upon the Isiac Table, hold the stem of this plant, surmounted
by the seed-vessel in one hand, and the cross, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) representing the male organs of
generation, in the other; thus signifying the universal power, both
active and passive, attributed to that goddess. On the same Isiac Table
is also the representation of an Egyptian temple, the columns of which
are exactly like the plant which Isis holds in her hand, except that the
stem is made larger, in order to give it that stability which is
necessary to support a roof and entablature. <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md) Columns and capitals of the same kind
are still existing, in great numbers, among the ruins of Thebes, in
Egypt; and more particularly upon those very curious ones in the island
of Philæ, on the borders of Ethiopia, which are, probably, the most
ancient monuments of art now extant; at least, if we except the
neighbouring temples of Thebes. Both were certainly built when that city
was the seat of wealth and empire, which it was, even to a

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

proverb, during the Trojan war. <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md)
How long it had then been so, we can form no conjecture; but that it
soon after declined, there can be little doubt; for, when the Greeks, in
the reign of Psammeticus (generally computed to have been about 530
years after the Siege of Troy), first became personally acquainted with
the interior parts of that country, Memphis had been for many ages its
capital, and Thebes was in a manner deserted. Homer makes Achilles speak
of its immense wealth and grandeur, as a matter generally known and
acknowledged; so that it must have been of long established fame, even
in that remote age. We may therefore fairly conclude, that the greatest
part of the superb edifices now remaining, were executed, or at least
begun, before that time; many of them being such as could not have been
finished, but in a long term of years, even if we suppose the wealth and
power of the ancient kings of Egypt to have equalled that of the
greatest of the Roman emperors. The finishing of Trajan's column in
three years, has been justly thought a very extraordinary effort; for
there must have been, at least, three hundred good sculptors employed
upon it: and yet, in the neighbourhood of Thebes, we find whole temples
of enormous magnitude, covered with

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

figures carved in the hard and brittle granite of the Libyan mountains,
instead of the soft marbles of Paros and Carrara. Travellers, who have
visited that country have given us imperfect accounts of the manner in
which they are finished; but, if one may judge by those upon the obelisc
of Rameses, now lying in fragments at Rome, they are infinitely more
laboured than those of Trajan's Column. An eminent sculptor, with whom I
examined that obelisc, was decidedly of opinion, that they must have
been finished in the manner of gems, with a graving tool; it appearing
impossible for a chisel to cut red granite with so much neatness and
precision. The age of Rameses is uncertain; but the generality of modern
chronologers suppose that he was the same person Sesostris, and reigned
at Thebes about 1500 years before the Christian æra, and about 300
before the Siege of Troy. Their dates are however merely conjectural,
when applied to events of this remote antiquity. The Egyptian priests of
the Augustan age had a tradition, which they pretended to confirm by
records written in hieroglyphics, that their country had once possest
the dominion of all Asia and Ethiopia, which their king Ramses, or
Rameses, had conquered. <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) Though
this account may be exaggerated,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

there can be no doubt, from the buildings still remaining, but that they
were once at the head of a great empire; for all historians agree that
they abhorred navigation, had no sea-port, and never enjoyed the
benefits of foreign commerce, without which, Egypt could have no means
of acquiring a sufficient quantity of superfluous wealth to erect such
expensive monuments, unless from tributary provinces; especially if all
the lower part of it was an uncultivated bog, as Herodotus, with great
appearance of probability, tells us it anciently was. Yet Homer, who
appears to have known all that could be known in his age, and
transmitted to posterity all he knew, seems to have heard nothing of
their empire or conquests. These were obliterated and forgotten by the
rise of new empires; but the renown of their ancient wealth still
continued, and afforded a familiar object of comparison, as that of the
Mogul does at this day, though he is become one of the poorest
sovereigns in the world.
