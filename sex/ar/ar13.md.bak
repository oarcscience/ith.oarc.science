# APPENDIX II

Now is related the Rasayana, or preparation of metals for medicinal
purposes.

### First Recipe

For the curing of disease caused by quicksilver. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md) Take sixty-four Tolas (each three
drachms) of the juice of betel-plant (*piper betel*); mix with equal
quantities of the juice of Bhringaraja (*edipta postrata*), juice of the
Tulsi (*ocymum basilicum*, herb basil) and goat's milk; and rub the
mixture into all parts of the body for two days, each day two pahars
(six hours) followed by a cold bath.

### Second Recipe

For reducing mercury to Bhasma (ashes, metallic oxide). Take of purified
quicksilver and sulphur equal parts, and levigate with the sap of the
Banyan-tree (*ficus indica*); place the preparation in an earthen pot
over a slow fire and stir with a stick of the Banyan-tree for a whole
day. If two Gunjas (1 5/10 grs. troy) of this medicine be eaten at early
morning in betel leaf, digestion is improved and the powers of
copulation are increased.

### Third Recipe

For preparing Hemagarbha, the Elixir Vitæ which contains gold. Take
three parts of purified quicksilver; one part and a half of sulphur; one
part of gold; two parts of the ashes (metallic oxide) of copper and caIx
of pearls and coral, each one-tenth of a part. Levigate in a mortar for
seven days with the juice of the Kumari (*aloe perfoliata*), make into a
ball, cover well with a piece of cotton cloth and place in an earthen
vessel, containing a little sulphur: the mouth must be well closed,
leaving for the escape of smoke a small hole which must be kept open
with a needle if necessary. Set the vessel over a Valukayantra (bain
marie, or sandbath) under which a slow fire is kindled. After about half
a Ghataka (12 minutes) the fire must be diminished and allowed to
extinguish. Remove the ball and use as the doctor directs.

### Fourth Recipe

For reducing Harital (Sanskrit, hartalaka, sulphuret of arsenic, yellow
orpiment) to ashes, or metallic oxide. Levigate yellow orpiment and
knead it with the juice of the plant Nagar-juni (a Cyperus grass).
Levigate again with the juice of the Pinpalli (*piper longum*) and the
Piper betel for two days. Make balls of the preparation; dry in shade;
then set in earthen vessel in a bain marie. A hot fire must be kept up
till the orpiment is thoroughly "cooked", and allow the fire to diminish
and extinguish. Lastly, remove the balls from the vessel and use in
every disease.

### Fifth Recipe

For absorbing all other metals by purified mercury.

Thoroughly levigate quicksilver with the juice of the "seven minor
poisons", viz., Arka (*Callotropis gigantea*), Sehunda (*Euphorbia*),
Dhatura (*Stramonium*, white thorn-apple), Langali (*Jussiaea repens*),
Karavira (oleander) or Soma <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) and
opium. By this means mercury loses its wings and cannot fly, while it
gets a mouth and eats up every metal with speed.

### Sixth Recipe

A sovereign remedy against all diseases and death. Take Abhraka (tale)
and levigate with the milky sap of the Arka for the space of a day. Then
wrap up the preparation in Arka-leaves and boil in a heap of Gobar
(cow-dung) cakes about two feet thick. Repeat this boiling with fresh
leaves for seven times, then infuse the preparation three times in a
decoction of Parambi Marathi, the fibrous roots of the Banyan-tree. In
this way the mineral is "killed"; its impurities are removed and it
becomes nishchandra talc. Boil equal parts of this and Ghi (clarified
butter) in an iron vessel till the butter is absorbed, and it is ready
for use; it cures every complaint, including old age and death.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_101"></span>[1](ar13.htm#fr_101.md) The Hindus are supposed to
have introduced the internal use of mercury which, in the shape of
corrosive sublimate, found its way to Europe. They must have soon
discovered the hideous effects of its abuse: in countries like Central
Africa, where mercury is unknown, Syphilis never attacks the bones of
the nose or face. The remedy in the text can do neither good nor harm.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[2](ar13.htm#fr_102.md) So the Dictionaries,
naming very different plants, Nerium odorum (with poisonous root) and
the harmless holy Soma (*Sercostamma*). But Kara-vira is a word of many
meanings.
