# CHAPTER I

### SECTION I

#### Of the Four Orders of Women.

First, let it be understood, that women must be divided into four
classes of temperament. These are:--

1\. Padmini  
2. Chatrini;  
3. Shankhini; and  
4. Hastini.

The same correspond with the four different phases of Moksha, or Release
from further Transmigration. The first is Sayujyata, or absorption into
the essence of the Deity; the second is Samipyata, nearness to the
Deity, the being born in the Divine Presence; the third is Sarupata, or
resemblance to the Deity in limbs and material body; the fourth and last
is Salokata, or residence in the heaven of some especial god.

For the name of woman is Nari, which, being interpreted, means "No
A'ri", or foe; and such is Moksha, or absorption, because all love it
and it loves all mankind.

Padmini, then, means Sayujyata, also called Khadgini-Moksha
(Sword-release), the absorption of man into the Narayan (godhead), who
lives in the Khshirabdi, or Milk-sea, one of the Seven Oceans, and from
whose naval sprang the Padma, or Lotus-flower.

Chitrini is Samipyata-Moksha, like those who, having been incarnated as
gods, perform manifold and wonderful works. Shankhini is
Sarupata-Moksha, even as the man who takes the form of Vishnu, bears
upon his body the Shankha (conch shell), the Chakra or discus, and other
emblems of that god. The Hastini is Salokata-Moksha, for she is what
residence in Vishnu's heaven is to those of the fourth class who have
attributes and properties, shape and form, hands and feet.

### SECTION II

#### Personal Peculiarities of the Four Classes.

And now learn ye by these words to distinguish from one another the four
orders of woman-kind.

She in whom the following signs and symptoms appear, is called Padmini,
or Lotus-woman. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3) Her face is pleasing
as the full moon; her body, well clothed with flesh., is soft as the
Shiras <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4) or mustard-flower; her skin

is fine, tender and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark-coloured,
though resembling, in the effervescence and purple light of her youth,
the cloud about to burst. Her eyes are bright and beautiful as the orbs
of the fawn, well-cut, and with reddish corners. Her bosom is hard, full
and high; her neck is goodly shaped as the conch-shell, so delicate that
the saliva can be seen through it; her nose is straight and lovely, and
three folds of wrinkles cross her middle, about the umbilical region.
Her Yoni <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5) resembles the open lotus-bud,
and her Love-seed (Kama-salila, the water of life) <span
id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6) is perfumed like the lily which has newly
burst. She walks with swanlike gait, and her voice is low and musical as
the note of the Kokila-bird <span id="fr_7"></span>[5](#fn_7); she
delights in white raiment, in fine jewels, and in rich dresses. She cats
little, sleeps lightly and, being as respectable and religious as she is
clever and courteous she is ever anxious to worship the gods, and to
enjoy the conversation of Brahmans. Such, then, is the Padmini, or
Lotus-woman.

The Chitrini, or Art-woman <span id="fr_8"></span>[6](#fn_8), is of the
middle size, neither short nor tall, with bee-black hair, thin, round,
shell-like neck; tender body; waist lean-girthed as the lion's; hard,
full breasts; well-turned thighs and heavily made hips. The hair is thin
about the Yoni, the Mons Veneris being soft, raised and round. The
Kama-salila

(love seed) is hot, and has the perfume of honey, producing from its
abundance a sound during the venereal rite. Her eyes roll, and her walk
is coquettish, like the swing of an elephant, whilst her voice is that
of the peacock <span id="fr_9"></span>[7](#fn_9). She is fond of
pleasure and variety; she delights in singing and in every kind of
accomplishment, especially the arts manual; her carnal desires, are not
strong, and she loves her "pets", parrots, Mainas and other birds. Such
is the Chitrini, or Art-woman.

The Shankhini <span id="fr_10"></span>[8](#fn_10), or Conch-woman, is of
bilious tempermament, her skin being always hot and tawny, or dark
yellow-brown; her body is large, or waist thick, and her breasts small;
her head, hands, and feet are thin and long, and she looks out of the
corners of her eyes. Her Yoni is ever moist with Kama-salila, which is
distinctly salt, and the cleft is covered with thick hair. Her voice is
hoarse and harsh, of the bass or contralto type; her gait is
precipitate; she eats with moderation and she delights in clothes,
flowers and ornaments of red colour. She is subject to fits of amorous
passion, which make her head hot and her brain confused <span
id="fr_11"></span>[9](#fn_11), and at the moment of enjoyment, she
thrusts her nails into her husband's flesh. She is of choleric
constitution, hard-hearted, insolent and vicious; irascible, rude and
ever addicted to finding fault. Such is the Shankhini, or Conch-woman.

The Hastini is short of stature; she has a stout, coarse body, and her
skin, if fair, is of a dead white; her hair is tawny, her lips are
large; her voice is harsh, choked, and throaty (*voix de gorge*) and her
neck is bent. Her gait is slow, and she walks in a slouching manner;
often the toes of one foot are crooked. Her Kama-salila has the savour
of the juice which flows in the spring from the elephant's temples. She
is tardy in the Art of Love, and can be satisfied only by prolonged
congress, in fact, the longer the better, but it will never suffice her.
She is gluttonous, shameless, and irascible. Such is the Hastini, or
elephant-woman. <span id="fr_12"></span>[10](#fn_12)

### SECTION III

#### The days of greatest enjoyment for the Four Classes

Having thus laid down the four classes of womankind, Kalyana Malla, the
arch-poet, proceeds to give a table of the time in which each order
derives the greatest amount of pleasure from the venereal rite. These
periods must be learnt by heart, and students will remember that on the
other days not specified, no amount of congress will satisfy passions.
Read, then, and master the elements.

### SECTION IV

#### Of the hours which give the highest enjoyment

Women, be it observed, differ greatly in the seasons which they prefer
for enjoyment, according to their classes and temperaments. The Padmini,
for instance, takes no satisfaction in night congress; indeed, she is
thoroughly averse to it. Like the Surya Kamala (day-lotus) which opens
its eyes to the sunlight, so she is satisfied even by a boy-husband in
the bright hours. The Chitrini and the Shankhini are like the Chandra
Kamala, or night-lotus, that expands to the rays of the moon; and the
Hastini, who is the coarsest, ignores all these delicate distinctions.

The following tables, then, show the Pahar, <span
id="fr_14"></span>[12](#fn_14) or watch of the night and day, during
which the four classes of women derive the greatest pleasure.

And here it will be observed that the Chitrini and the Shankhini derive
no satisfaction from day congress.

Thus did the arch-poet, Kalyana Malla, relate unto Ladkhan Rajah how
women are divided into four classes, each of which has its own
peculiarity of body and mind, and its several times of enjoyments,
according to the state of the moon and the hour of the day or night.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[1](ar03.htm#fr_3) Evidently the nervous
temperament, with due admixture of the bilious and sanguine.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[2](ar03.htm#fr_4) A lofty tree with soft and
fragrant pollen.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[3](ar03.htm#fr_5) The Yoni the feminine opposite
to the Linga (Priapus) or male apparatus.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[4](ar03.htm#fr_6) See note, chap. iv., on the
Hindu ideas of human sperm, and for the vermicules of the Yoni, chap.
iii., sec. 3.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[5](ar03.htm#fr_7) Usually known as the Indian
cuckoo, though its voice is harsh and disagreeable; in poetry and
romance it takes the place of the bulbul of Persia, and the nightingale
of Europe.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[6](ar03.htm#fr_8) The sanguine temperament.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[7](ar03.htm#fr_9) Meaning excellent as that of
the Peacock, which is not disliked by the Hindus as by Europeans. They
associate it with the breaking of the rainy monsoon, which brings joy to
the thirsty earth and sun-parched men.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[8](ar03.htm#fr_10) The bilious temperament.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[9](ar03.htm#fr_11) So Apollonius of Rhodes,
describing the passion of Medeia, says:--"The fire which devours her,
attacks all her nerves, and makes itself felt even behind the head in
that spot where pain is most poignant when an extreme fervour seizes on
all the senses."

<span id="fn_12"></span>[10](ar03.htm#fr_12) "Elephant"-woman, because
the animal being called the "handed one," from the use of the trunk, and
Hastini corresponds with Karami, from kara, a hand. She is "mulier
nigris dignissima barris," and of the lymphatic or lowest temperament.
These divisions represent, we have noted, roughly and unscientifically,
the four European temperaments, nervous, sanguine, bilious and
lymphatic. In a future chapter, the three Hindu temperaments will be
discussed.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[11](ar03.htm#fr_13) The days (Tithi) are those
of the lunar fortnight: the Pratipada, for instance, being the first,
when the moon's increase and wane begin.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[12](ar03.htm#fr_14) As amongst the classics,
day and night are divided by the Hindus with eight watches, each of
seven ghari, or hours (1 ghari = 241).
