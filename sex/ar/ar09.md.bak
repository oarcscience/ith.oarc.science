# CHAPTER VII

#### OF DIFFERENT SIGNS IN MEN AND WOMEN <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)

THE characteristics of a woman whom we should take to wife, are as
follows: She should come from a family of equal rank with that of her
husband, a house which is known to be valiant and chaste, wise and
learned, prudent and patient, correct and becomingly behaved, and famed
for acting according to its religion, and for discharging its social
duties. She should be free from vices and endowed with all good
qualities, possess a fair face and fine person, have brothers and
kinsfolk, and be a great proficient in the Kama-shastra, or Science of
Love. Such a girl is truly fitted for marriage; and let a sensible man
hasten to take her, by performing the ceremonies which are commanded in
the Holy Law.

And here may be learned the marks whereby beauty and good shape of body
are distinguished. The maiden whose face is soft and pleasing as the
moon; whose eyes are bright and liquid as the fawn's; whose nose is
delicate as the sesamum flowers; whose teeth are clean as diamonds and
clear as pearls; whose ears are small and rounded; whose neck is like a
sea-shell, with three delicate lines or tracings behind; whose lower lip
is red as the ripe fruit of the bryony; whose hair is black as the
Bhramara's <span id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md) wing; whose skin is
brilliant as the flower of the dark-blue lotus, or light as the surface
of polished gold; whose feet and hands are red, being marked with the
circular Chakra or discus; <span id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34.md) whose
stomach is small, whilst the umbilical region is drawn in; whose shape
below the hips is large; whose thighs, being well-proportioned and
pleasing as the plantain-tree, make her walk like the elephant, neither
too fast nor too slow; whose voice is sweet as the Kokila-bird's-such a
girl, especially if her temper be good, her nature kindly, her sleep
short and her mind and body not inclined to laziness, should at once be
married by the wise man.

But the girl who comes from a bad family; whose body is either very
short or very tall, very fat or very thin; whose skin is ever rough and
hard; whose hair and eyes are yellowish, the latter like a cat's; whose
teeth are long, or are wholly wanting; whose mouth and lips are wide and
projecting, <span id="fr_35"></span>[4](#fn_35.md) with the lower lip of
dark colour, and tremulous when speaking; who allows her tongue to loll
out; whose eyebrows are straight; whose temples are depressed; who shows
signs of beard, mustachios, and dense body-pile; whose neck is thick;
who has some limbs shorter and other longer than the usual proportion;
whose one breast is large or high, and the other low or small; whose
ears are triangular, like a sifting or winnowing fan; whose second toe
is larger and longer than the big toe; <span
id="fr_36"></span>[5](#fn_36.md) whose third toe is blunt, without tip or
point, and whose little toes do not touch the ground; whose voice is
harsh and laugh is loud; who walks quickly and with uncertain gait; who
is full-grown; who is disposed to be sickly, and who bears the name of a
mountain (as Govardhan), <span id="fr_37"></span>[6](#fn_37.md) of a tree
(as Anbi), of a river (as Tarangini), of a bird (as Chimani), or of a
constellation (as Revati, the 27th lunar mansion)--such a girl,
especially if her disposition be irascible and temper violent; if she
eat and sleep much; if she be always vexed, troubled and distressed; if
her disposition be restless and fidgetty; if she has little
understanding in worldly matters; if she be destitute of shame and if
her natural disposition be wicked, should be carefully avoided, under
all circumstances, by the wise.

So much for the characteristics of the woman. On the other hand, man
should be tried, even as gold is tested, in four ways: 1, by the
touchstone; 2, by cutting; 3, by heating: and, 4, by hammering. Thus
should we take into consideration--1, learning; 2, disposition; 3,
qualities; and 4, action. The first characteristic of a man is courage,
with endurance; if he attempt any deed, great or small, he should do it
with the spirit of a lion. Second, is prudence: time and place must be
determined, and opportunity devised, like the Bak-heron, that stands
intently eyeing its prey in the pool below. The third is early rising,
and causing others to do the same. The fourth is hardihood in war. The
fifth is a generous distribution and division of food and property
amongst family and friends. The sixth is duly attending to the wants of
the wife. The seventh is circumspection in love matters. The eighth is
secrecy and privacy in the venereal act. The ninth is patience and
perseverance in all the business of life. The tenth is judgment in
collecting and in storing up what may be necessary. The eleventh is not
to allow wealth and worldly success to engender pride and vanity,
magnificence and ostentation. The twelfth is never aspiring to the
unattainable. The thirteenth is contentment with what the man has, if he
can get no more. The fourteenth is plainness of diet. The fifteenth is
to avoid over-sleep. The sixteenth is to be diligent in the service of
employers. The seventeenth is not to fly when attacked by robbers and
villains. The eighteenth is working willingly; for instance, not taking
into consideration the sun and shade if the labourer be obliged to carry
a parcel. The nineteenth is the patient endurance of trouble. The
twentieth is to keep the eye fixed upon a great business; and the
twenty-first is to study the means properest for success. Now, any
person who combines these twenty one qualities is deservedly reputed an
excellent man.

When choosing a son-in-law, the following characteristics should be
aimed at: He must come from a large family, which has never known sin
and poverty. He must be young, handsome, wealthy, brave and influential;
diligent in business, moderate in enjoying riches, sweet of speech, well
versed in discharging his own dudes, known to the world as a mine of
virtues, steadfast in mind, and a treasury of mercy, who gives alms and
makes charities as far as his means permit. Such a .nan is described by
celebrated poets as a fit person to whom the daughter should be given in
marriage.

And these are the defects and blemishes of a son-in-law: The man who is
born in a low family, who is vicious, a libertine, pitiless, and ever
sickly with dangerous disease, sinful and very wicked, poor and miserly,
impotent, prone to conceal the virtues and to divulge the vices of
others; a constant traveller, an absentee, one ever away from his home
and residing abroad; a debtor, a beggar, a man who has no friendship
with the good, or who, if he have it, breaks into quarrel upon trifling
things-such a person the wise will not accept as a son-in-law.

We now proceed to the Samudrika-lakshana or chiromantic signs, good and
bad, which affect present and future happiness. The length of a man's
and woman's life, and the marks which denote it, must first be treated
of, because it is useless to see auspicious details if death may shortly
be expected. And first of all the palmistry of the man.

Every perfect hand and foot consists of five members, namely the
Angushtha (thumb), the Tarjani (forefinger), the Madhyama
(middle-finger), the Anamika (ring-finger), and the Kanishthika
(little-finger). Now, if an unbroken line in the palm <span
id="fr_38"></span>[7](#fn_38.md) run from the "mount", or base of the
little finger, to that of the forefinger, it is a sign that the bearer
will live a hundred years. But the man in whose palm an unbroken line
runs from the ball or cushion of the little finger to that of the middle
finger, should be considered as likely to live for a period of sixty
years. Moreover, the man upon whose thumb or chest there is a figure
shaped like a barley grain <span id="fr_39"></span>[8](#fn_39.md), the same
will eat bread earned by his own exertions, and he will ever remain
happy. As a rule, if the lines in the palms be few, men are poor and
penniless; if there be four they are happy; and if more than four, they
are threatened with mean and wretched fortunes; moreover, the much
streaked palm shows a quarrelsome nature.

The man whose eye is red, whose body is fair and of good complexion
likes gold; whose trunk is fleshy and whose arms reach his knees <span
id="fr_40"></span>[9](#fn_40.md), the same will always remain rich and
enjoy grandeur, opulence, lordship and supremacy.

The man whose thighs are large, will win great wealth; the man whose
waist is broad, will be blessed in his wife and many children; the man
whose feet are long <span id="fr_41"></span>[10](#fn_41.md), and whose
hands are very delicate, will always enjoy happiness; and the man whose
head is large and lengthy <span id="fr_42"></span>[11](#fn_42.md), will
rise to be a prince.

The man whose Linga is very long, will be wretchedly poor. The man whose
Linga is very thick, will ever be in distress. The man whose Linga is
thin and lean, will be very lucky; and the man whose Linga is short,
will be a Rajah. <span id="fr_43"></span>[12](#fn_43.md) So much concerning
the characteristics of men.

And now as regards the other sex. The woman of inauspicious signs, will
be or become an orphan, a widow, destitute of brothers and sisters, and
without connections, as well as relations, so that her life ends, as it
began, in bitterness. Her characteristics, therefore, should be
carefully examined before marriage with her is contracted.

Let it be understood that the woman who bears on the sole of her left
foot the signs of the Chakra (quoit, peculiar to Vishnu), the Padma
(lotus), the Dhvaja (flag), the Chatra (umbrella), the mystical
Svastika, <span id="fr_44"></span>[13](#fn_44.md) and the Kamala, that is,
circular lines <span id="fr_45"></span>[14](#fn_45.md), and not
conch-shaped on her finger-tips, that woman will be a Rani (queen). If,
however, one or more of these figures be wanting, she will enjoy all the
happiness of a crowned head.

The woman who bears on the sole of her left foot a line extending from
the "mount" or cushion of the little toe, to the ball of the big toe,
that woman will readily obtain a god husband, and will find great
happiness in his love.

The woman whose two little toes do not touch the ground whilst walking,
will certainly lose her husband; and during her widowhood, she will not
be able to keep herself chaste.

The woman whose Tarjani or second toe is the longest of all the toes,
will be unchaste even before marriage. What doubt, then, is there of her
being an adulteress as long as her youth endures?

The woman whose breasts are fleshy, firm, and handsome, whose bosom is
without hair, and whose thighs are like the trunk of an elephant, will
enjoy a life of happiness.

The maiden who has black moles upon her left breast, throat and ears,
will marry and bear a son having auspicious marks; and by her means, all
the family will be called blessed.

The maiden whose neck is very long, will be of a wicked and cruel
disposition. The maiden whose neck is very short, will be wretchedly
poor. The maiden whose neck has three lines or wrinkles, will be of a
good disposition, and her lot will be ever fortunate.

The maiden who bears in the palm of her hand lines resembling enclosing
walls, and "Toran" or garlands of flowers, and twigs of trees bent into
circles <span id="fr_46"></span>[15](#fn_46.md), will become the wife of a
King, although she have been born in a servant's house.

The maiden whose palms have lines in the shape of an Ankush (spiked hook
for guiding elephants), a Kuntala (or spur), and a Chakra (quoit or
discus), will intermarry with a royal house, and bear a son who shows
the most fortunate signs.

It is written in the book Naradokta <span id="fr_47"></span>[16](#fn_47.md)
that marriage should never be contracted with a girl, unless the lines
and spots, as interpreted by treatises on Chiromancy, are first examined
and found good. The consequence of unauspicious signs is that her birth
will cause the death of her father, mother and brother in succession.
The man who marries such a maiden, will presently die, and be followed
by all his brethren, and these two families will be destroyed.

There are seven kinds of troubles which result from having intercourse
with the wife of another man. Firstly, adultery shortens or lessens the
period of life; secondly, the body becomes spiritless and vigourless;
thirdly, the world derides and reproaches the lover; fourthly, he
despises himself; fifthly, his wealth greatly decreases; sixthly, he
suffers much in this world; and seventhly, he will suffer more in the
world to come. Yet, despite all this ignominy, disgrace and contumely,
it is absolutely necessary to have connection with the wife of another,
under certain circumstances, which will be presently specified.

Great and powerful monarchs have ruined themselves and their realms by
their desire to enjoy the wives of others. For instance, in former days
the family of the Ravana, King of Lanka (Ceylon), was destroyed because
he forcibly abducted Sita, the wife of Rama, and this action gave rise
to the Ramayana poem, which is known to the whole world. Vali lost his
life for attempting to have connection with Tara, as is fully described
in the Kishkinda-kand, a chapter of that history. Kichaka, the Kaurava,
together with all his brethren, met with destruction, because he wished
to have Draupada <span id="fr_48"></span>[17](#fn_48.md) (daughter of
Drupad), the common wife of the Pandu brothers, as is described in the
Viratparvi (section) of the Mahabharat. Such are the destructions which
in days past have happened to those who coveted other men's wives; let
none, therefore, attempt adultery even in their thoughts.

But there are ten changes in the natural state of men, which require to
be taken into consideration. Firstly, when he is in a state of Dhyasa
(*desiderium*), at a loss to do anything except to see a particular
woman; secondly, when he finds his mind wandering, as if he were about
to lose his senses; thirdly, when he is ever losing himself in thought
how to woo and win the woman in question; fourthly, when he passes
restless nights without the refreshment of sleep; fifthly, when his
looks become haggard and his body emaciated; sixthly, when he feels
himself growing shameless and departing from all sense of decency and
decorum; seventhly, when his riches take to themselves wings and fly;
eighthly, when the state of mental intoxication verges upon madness;
ninthly, when fainting fits come on; and tenthly, when he finds himself
at the door of death. <span id="fr_49"></span>[18](#fn_49.md)

That these states are produced by sexual passion may be illustrated by
an instance borrowed from the history of bygone days. Once upon a time
there was a king called Pururava, who was a devout man, and who entered
upon such a course of mortification and austerities that Indra, Lord of
the Lower Heaven, began to fear lest he himself might be dethroned. The
god, therefore, in order to interrupt these penances and other religious
acts, sent down from Svarga, his own heaven, Urvashi, the most lovely of
the Apsaras (nymphs). The king no sooner saw her than he fell in love
with her, thinking day and night of nothing but possessing her, till at
last, succeeding in his project, both spent a long time in the pleasures
of carnal connection. Presently Indra, happening to remember the Apsara,
despatched his messenger, one of the Gandharvas (heavenly minstrels), to
the world of mortals, and recalled her. Immediately after her departure,
the mind of Pururava began to wander; he could no longer concentrate his
thoughts upon worship and he felt upon the point of death.

See, then, the state to which that king was reduced by thinking so much
about Urvashi! When a man has allowed himself to be carried away captive
of desire, he must consult a physician, and the books of medicine which
treat upon the subject. And, if he comes to the conclusion that unless
he enjoy his neighbour's wife he will surely die, he should, for the
sake of preserving his life, possess her once and once only. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[19](#fn_50.md) If, however, there be no such peremptory
cause, he is by no means justified in enjoying the wife of another
person, merely for the sake of pleasure and wanton gratification.

Moreover, the book of Vatsyayana, the Rishi, teaches us as follows:
Suppose that a woman, having reached the lusty vigour of her age, happen
to become so inflamed with love for a man, and so heated by passion that
she feels herself failing into the ten states before described, and
likely to end in death attended with frenzy, if her beloved refuse her
sexual commerce. Under these circumstances, the man, after allowing
himself to be importuned for a time, should reflect that his refusal
will cost her life; he should, therefore, enjoy her on one occasion, but
not always.

The following women, however, are absolutely, and under all
circumstances, to be excluded from any commerce of the kind. The wife of
a Brahman; of a Shrotiya (Brahman learned in the Vedas); of an Agnihotri
(priest who keeps up the sacred fire), and of a Puranik (reader of the
Puranas). To look significantly at such a woman, or to think of her with
a view of sensual desire, is highly improper: what, then, must we think
of the sin of carnal couplation with her? In like manner, men prepare to
go to Naraka (hell) by lying with the wife of a Khatriya (king, or any
man of the warrior caste, now extinct); of a friend or of a relation.
The author of this book strongly warns and commands his readers to avoid
all such deadly sins.

Indeed, there are certain other women who are never to be enjoyed,
however much a man may be tempted. First, a virgin without marrying her;
second, a widow <span id="fr_51"></span>[20](#fn_51.md); third, a woman
living chastely or virtuously with her husband; fourth, the wife of our
friend; fifth, the wife of our foe; sixth, any of the reverend women
specified above; seventh, the wife of a pupil or a disciple; eighth, a
woman born in one's own family; ninth, a woman who has been defiled;
tenth, a mad woman; eleventh, a woman older than one's self <span
id="fr_52"></span>[21](#fn_52.md); twelfth, the wife of a Guru, spiritual
tutor, instructor or guide; thirteenth, one's mother-in-law; fourteenth,
one's maternal aunt (mother's sister); fifteenth, the wife of one's
maternal uncle <span id="fr_53"></span>[22](#fn_53.md); sixteenth, one's
paternal aunt (father's sister); seventeenth, one's paternal uncle's
wife; eighteenth, a sister; nineteenth, a pregnant woman; twentieth, a
woman with whom one is not acquainted; twenty-first, a woman who has
committed mortal sins and crimes; twenty-second, a woman whose
complexion is entirely yellow; twenty-third, a woman whose complexion is
quite black. It is laid down in the Shastras (scriptures) that the wise
should never, under any circumstances, have connection with these
twenty-three kinds of women, as well as with others, bearing any
relationship to one.

The following is a list of the women who serve but as go-betweens <span
id="fr_54"></span>[23](#fn_54.md): First, a gardener's wife. Second, a
woman who is a personal friend. Third, a widow. Fourth, a nurse. Fifth,
a dancing-girl. Sixth, a woman engaged in manual or mechanical arts.
Seventh, a woman hired as a servant or maid to the women of the family.
Eighth, an attendant as distinguished from a slave girl. Ninth, a woman
who goes from house to house speaking sweet words. Tenth, a woman with
whom we can talk freely about love and enjoyment. Eleventh, a young
woman under sixteen. Twelfth, a female ascetic or mendicant in the name
of religion.

Thirteenth, a woman who sells milk and buttermilk. Fourteenth, a
tailoress. Fifteenth, a woman fit to be called "Mistress Grandmother".
The amorous should prefer these kind of persons, as, when deputed upon
such messages, they do their work kindly and well.

The following is a list of the women who can most easily be
subdued. <span id="fr_55"></span>[24](#fn_55.md) First, a woman whose
deportment shows signs of immodesty. Second, a widow. Third, a woman who
is highly accomplished in singing, in playing musical instruments, and
in similar pleasant arts. Fourth, a woman who is fond of conversation.
Fifth, a woman steeped in poverty. Sixth, the wife of an imbecile or an
impotent person. Seventh, the wife of a fat and tun-bellied man. Eighth,
the wife of a cruel and wicked man. Ninth, the wife of one who is
shorter than herself. Tenth, the wife of an old man. Eleventh, the wife
of a very ugly man. Twelfth, a woman accustomed to stand in the doorway
and to stare at passers-by. Thirteenth, women of variable disposition.
Fourteenth, the barren woman, especially if she and her husband desire
the blessing of issue. Fifteenth, the woman who brags and boasts.
Sixteenth, the woman who has long been separated from her husband, and
deprived of her natural refreshment. Seventeenth, the woman who has
never learned the real delight of carnal copulation; <span
id="fr_56"></span>[25](#fn_56.md) and eighteenth, the woman whose mind
remains girlish.

And now to describe the signs and symptoms by which we are to know when
women are enamoured of us. Firstly, that woman loves a man when she is
not ashamed of looking at him, <span id="fr_57"></span>[26](#fn_57.md) and
of boldly and without fear or deference keeping her eyes fixed upon his.
Secondly, when she moves her foot to and fro whilst standing up, and
draws, as it were, lines upon the ground. Thirdly, when she scratches
divers limbs without sufficient reason. Fourthly, when she leers, looks
obliquely, and casts side glances. Fifthly, when she laughs causelessly
at the sight of a man.

And furthermore, the woman who, instead of answering a straightforward
question, replies by joking and jesting words; who slowly and
deliberately follows us wherever we go; who, under some pretext or
other, dwells upon our faces or forms with a wistful and yearning
glance; who delights in walking before us and displaying her legs or her
bosom; who behaves to us with a mean and servile submission, ever
praising and flattering; who contracts friendships with our friends and
who is ever asking them, "In the house of such and such a person, are
there any wives? Does he love them much? And are they very beautiful?"
Who, looking towards us, sings a sweet air; who passes her hands
frequently over her breasts and her arms; who cracks her fingers; who
yawns and sighs when not expected to do so; who will never appear before
us, though we call and summon her, unless in her most becoming dress;
who throws flowers and similar articles upon us; who, pretexting various
things, often goes into and comes forth from the house; and finally,
whose face, hands, and feet break into perspiration when she casually
sees us; that woman showing any such signs and symptoms, is enamoured of
us, and is strongly excited by passion; all we have to do, if versed in
the art of love, is to send an able go-between.

On the other hand, the following women are hard to be subdued: First,
the wife who is full of love for her husband. Second, the woman whose
cold desires and contempt for congress keep her chaste. Third, the woman
who is envious of another's prosperity and success. Fourth, the mother
of many children. Fifth, a dutiful daughter or daughter-in-law. Sixth, a
courteous and respectful woman. Seventh, a woman who fears and stands in
awe of her parents and those of her husband. Eighth, a wealthy woman,
who ever suspects and often wrongly, that we love her money better than
herself. Ninth, a woman who is shy, bashful, and retiring in the
presence of strangers. Tenth, an avaricious and covetous woman.
Eleventh, a woman who has no avarice or covetousness. Such women are not
easily secured, nor is it worth our while to waste our hours in pursuing
them.

The following are the places where a woman should not be enjoyed: First,
the place where fire is lighted with the religious formula Agni-mukha
and other Mantras. Second, in the presence of a Brahman or any other
reverend man. Third, under the eyes of an aged person, to whom respect
is due, as a Guru (spiritual guide), or a father. Fourth, when a great
man is looking on. Fifth, by the side of a river or any murmuring
stream. Sixth, at a Panwata, a place erected for drawing water from
wells, tanks and so forth. Seventh, in a temple dedicated to the gods.
Eighth, in a fort or castle. Ninth, in a guard-room, police-station, or
in any government place where prisoners are confined. Tenth, on a
highway. Eleventh, in a house of another person. Twelfth, in the forest.
Thirteenth, in an open place, such as a meadow or an upland. Fourteenth,
on ground where men are buried or burned. The consequences of carnal
connection at such places are always disastrous; they breed misfortunes,
and, if children are begotten, these turn out bad and malicious persons.

The following are the times when women are not to be enjoyed: First, by
day, unless their class and temperament require coition during the light
hours. Second, during or at the Sankranti-parvani, that is to say, when
the sun or a planet passes from one side of the zodiac to another. <span
id="fr_58"></span>[27](#fn_58.md) Third, during the Sharad, or cold
season <span id="fr_59"></span>[28](#fn_59) (October to November.md).
Fourth, during the Grishma, or hot season <span
id="fr_60"></span>[29](#fn_60) (June to July.md). Fifth, in the Amavasya
(the last, the thirtieth, or the new moon day of the Hindu month),
unless the Love-shastra specify the contrary. Sixth, during the periods
when the man's body suffers from fever. Seventh, during the time of a
"Vrata" any self-imposed religious observance, with obligation to carry
it out. Eighth, in the evening time; and ninth, when wearied with
warfare. The consequences of congress at such epochs are as disastrous
as if the act took place in a prohibited spot.

The following is the situation which the wise men of old have described
as being best fitted for sexual intercourse with women. Choose the
largest, and finest, and the most airy room in the house, purify it
thoroughly with whitewash, and decorate its spacious and beautiful walls
with pictures and other objects upon which the eye may dwell with
delight. <span id="fr_61"></span>[30](#fn_61.md) Scattered about this
apartment place musical instruments, especially the pipe and the lute;
with refreshments, as cocoa-nut, betel-leaf and milk, which is so useful
for retaining and restoring vigour; bottles of rose water and various
essences, fans and chauris for cooling the air, and books containing
amorous songs, and gladdening the glance with illustrations of
love-postures. Splendid Divalgiri, or wall lights, should gleam around
the wall, reflected by a hundred mirrors, whilst both man and woman
should contend against any reserve, or false shame, giving themselves up
in complete nakedness to unrestrained voluptuousness, upon a high and
handsome bedstead, raised on tall legs, furnished with many pillows, and
covered by a rich chatra, or canopy; the sheets being besprinkled with
flowers and the coverlet scented by burning luscious incense, such as
aloes and other fragrant woods. <span id="fr_62"></span>[31](#fn_62.md) In
such a place, let the man, ascending the throne of love, enjoy the woman
in ease and comfort, gratifying his and her every wish and every whim.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_32"></span>[1](ar09.htm#fr_32.md) This chapter has been left
in all its original confusion of subjects; it would be easy to order it
otherwise; but then it would lose *cachet*.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[2](ar09.htm#fr_33.md) The large black bee of
Southern Europe, India, etc. Corresponding with the "bumble bee" of
England, but without the yellow markings.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[3](ar09.htm#fr_34.md) Alluded to in a future part
of the chapter.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[4](ar09.htm#fr_35.md) All Easterns uphold the
doctrine of the Salernitan School. Noscitur a labiis quantum sit
virginis antrum: nocitur a naso quanta sit hasta viro.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[5](ar09.htm#fr_36.md) In Europe there is much
dispute concerning this canon. But the big toe represents the thumb
which distinguishes the human from the simian hand, and the longer and
the better formed the two are, the higher is the organisation. In this
matter races greatly differ: compare, for instance, the short thumb of
the Anglo-Saxon with the long thumb of the Celt, or the common
Englishman with the common Irishman.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[6](ar09.htm#fr_37.md) The Hill in Mathura, which
Krishna held up in hand.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[7](ar09.htm#fr_38.md) As a rule the palmistry of
the Gypsies is directly derived, like their language, from India, and so
artificial a system speaks strongly in favour of a single origin and
propagation by tradition. Here, however, the "line of life" (linea
vitae) is transferred from the base of the thumb to an unusual place,
technically called the Cingulum Veneris.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[8](ar09.htm#fr_39.md) This figure Europeans turn
into an M, and hold to mean marriage. The "barley-mark" in the text
seems to correspond with the triangle formed by the "supreme natural
Line," the "Line of Life," and the "Line of the Lunar Mount." (Richard
Saunders, "Physiognomie and Chiromancie," London, 1671; and "Les
mystéres de la Main," Ad. Desbarolles, Paris, Dentu, 1862).

<span id="fn_40"></span>[9](ar09.htm#fr_40.md) Such was the case with the
celebrated Highland cateran, Rob Roy Macgregor.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[10](ar09.htm#fr_41.md) An unusual conformation in
the Indian, whose short thin feet are despised by the Afghans, and the
adjacent mountaineers. When Ranjit Singh ordered a hundred matchlocks
from a celebrated gunsmith across the Indus, he received in return a
slipper with a message that the order would be executed as soon as a
Sikh's foot could be found to fit that shoe.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[11](ar09.htm#fr_42.md) An idea long familiar to
the world before the days of Dr. Gall.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[12](ar09.htm#fr_43.md) Here we find a Hindu origin
for the naughty schoolboy lines about short and thick--long and thin.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[13](ar09.htm#fr_44.md) The Svastika is the
crutched cross, known to the Scandinavians as the "hammer of Thor," and
supposed to denote the thunderbolt. It is painted on doors in India as
an auspicious mark or seal, and is affixed to documents in lieu of
signatures by Hindu wives (not widows), who cannot write their names.
"Svastika," amongst the Jains, is the emblem of the seventh Guru or
spiritual teacher, and the word is also applied to a temple built in the
shape of a symbol.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[14](ar09.htm#fr_45.md) The circular lines being
held particularly auspicious.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[15](ar09.htm#fr_46.md) These ornaments are hung
from doorways or about awnings on festive occasions.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[16](ar09.htm#fr_47.md) That is, the book written
by Narada, one of the twenty Rishis or Sages, and a son of Brahma. His
name is properly applied to a quarrelsome and embroiling fellow.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[17](ar09.htm#fr_48.md) These three represent
"Helen of Troy" in the classical history of Hindustan.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[18](ar09.htm#fr_49.md) These ten are the
progressive stages of love longing.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[19](ar09.htm#fr_50.md) This was the heathen idea
generally, and a friend would hardly have felt justified in refusing,
under such circumstances, the loan of his wife. So Seleucus, King of
Syria, gave the fair Stratonike to his son, Antiochus, in order to save
a life which was endangered by the violence of passion. Equally generous
was Socrates, the "Christian before Christianity"; which generosity may,
perhaps, account in part for the temper of Xantippe.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[20](ar09.htm#fr_51.md) Because by Hindu custom, if
not by the old law, the lover cannot marry a widow.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[21](ar09.htm#fr_52.md) Easterns are all agreed
upon this point, and the idea is that the embraces of a woman older than
the husband, "burn" and destroy his strength. It is certain that when
there is a considerable difference of age, the younger of the two
suffers in appearance, if not in health. How many women we see in
civilized countries with that young-old look, which at once assures the
observer that they are married to men much their seniors? We seldom meet
in society with the reverse case, for ridicule always attaches to a
man's marrying a woman whose age greatly exceeds his own. Yet the few
instances which appear justify our belief that there is something the
reverse of hygienic in the practice.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[22](ar09.htm#fr_53.md) In Sanskrit, and in the
Prakrit or modern language of Hindostan, there are different names for
our "aunt" Mavashi, for instance, is the maternal aunt, and Mami, the
maternal uncle's wife.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[23](ar09.htm#fr_54.md) This need not necessarily
be taken in a bad sense, as "procuress". In Hindu, as well as in Muslim
families, women are sufficiently secluded to require the assistance of
feminine Mercuries in matters of marriage.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[24](ar09.htm#fr_55.md) This can hardly be used in
an honest sense: it might be translated "Seduced," were not that word so
liable to misuse and misconstruction. What man in his senses can believe
in the "seduction" of a married woman? As a rule, indeed, the seduction
is all on the other side.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[25](ar09.htm#fr_56.md) Which, allow us to state,
is the case with most English women and a case to be remedied only by
constant and intelligent study of the Ananga Ranga Scripture.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[26](ar09.htm#fr_57.md) In the East, women take the
first step in such matters. Nothing can be more ridiculous than to see
the bearded and turbaned Turk blushing, "boggling," and looking silly as
he is being inspected by a pair of bold feminine eyes.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[27](ar09.htm#fr_58) Parvani (Sanskrit Parva.md),
is applied to certain times, such as the solstices and the equinoxes,
when good actions arc most acceptable.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[28](ar09.htm#fr_59.md) It must be remembered that
during the whole period of the sun's southing (Dakshanayana, opposed to
Uttarayana, or his northerly direction), the high-caste Hindu will not
marry.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[29](ar09.htm#fr_60.md) The other four are Vasanta,
or spring (April to May); Varsha, the rains (August to September);
Hermanta, or the cold season (December to January); and Shishira, early
spring (February to March). Thus the Hindu year contains six Ritu or
seasons.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[30](ar09.htm#fr_61.md) This precaution might be
adopted in modern civilization. It was practised by the Greeks and
Romans, for the purpose of begetting graceful and beautiful children;
and, considering the history of mother-marks and other puerperal
curiosities, we should be careful how we determine that the conception
cannot be favourably, as well as unfavourably influenced by the aspect
of objects around the parents.

perfumes upon the organs, see Chapter IX.
