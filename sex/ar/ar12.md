# APPENDIX I

#### ASTROLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH MARRIAGE <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97)

Now is related the effect resulting from the consonance and dissonance,
amity and hospitality, between the stars (and destinies) of a couple
proposed to be bride and bridegroom. <span id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_98)
Having ascertained that the houses (*kula*), the family names (*gotra*),
and the individual dispositions (*svabhava*) of the postulants are free
from inherent blemish, <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_99) their Gunas
(qualities or requisites) must be determined from the zodiacal signs and
the asterisms presiding over their birth. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[4](#fn_100)

The Gunas, number in total thirty-six, of which at least nineteen are
requisite for a prosperous match; and thence upwards, the fruit
resulting from their influence is proportional to their number.

Observations upon these subjects will be facilitated by the three
following tables:

Table I shows the presiding planet, the genus (or nature) and the caste
(in theory not in practice) of the questioner, when the zodiacal sign of
his birth-time is known. For instance, if Sol be in Aries at the birth
of the patient, his planet is Mars; he belongs to the genus quadruped,
and he is by caste a Kshatriya or fighting-man.

Table II

|                                                           |     |          |

| Of Caste the highest No. of Requisites is 1               | 1   |          |
| Of Vashya, of keeping in subjection, the highest No. is 2 | 2   |          |
| Of the power of Nakshatras or asterisms the highest is 3  | 3   |          |
| Of Class the highest No. is 4                             | 4   | TOTAL 36 |
| Of Planets the highest No. is 5                           | 5   |          |
| Of Group the highest No. is 6                             | 6   |          |
| Of Kuta the highest No. is 7                              | 7   |          |
| Of Nadi the highest No. is 8                              | 8   |          |

 

Table II shows the number of Guna, or qualities, requisite for a
prosperous match distributed under eight heads.

Table III shows the group and class to which a person belongs when the
asterism. (Nakshatra, or lunar mansion) of his birth-time is known,
together with his Nadi, or hour of twenty-four minutes. The twenty-seven
asterisms are classed under three heads: of gods, of men and of demons
(Rakshasas), and the asterism determines to which the querent belongs.
Moreover, each asterism. is divided into four quarters, and of these
nine make one zodiacal sign. The name-letter used in last quarter stands
for that quarter.

And now to consider the tables more carefully. As is shown by No. II,
the Gunas are of various values, and are distributed under eight heads.

1\. Caste. If both be of the same, or the caste of the bridegroom be
higher, there is one Guna (of the thirty-six) otherwise there is none.

2\. Vashya, or keeping in subjection, one of the prime considerations of
marriage. If the zodiacal signs of bride and bridegroom be of the same
genus (Table I) this represents two Gunas. If the person kept in
subjection be also the "food" of the other, this counts for only
one-half (Guna). If there be natural friendship between the genera of
the bride and bridegroom this stands for two Gunas; and if one be an
enemy to the other, and also keep the other in subjection, it represents
only one Guna. The consideration is as follows: To the human genus every
quadruped, saving only the lion, remains in subjection; for instance,
the quadruped ram is subject to, and is the "food" of, the human genus,
with one exception, the Brahman. The same is the case with the fish and
the crab amongst lower animals. The scorpion is the general enemy to the
human race, and other animals are enemies as well as food. Thus we
discover which of the two persons will hold the other in subjection.

3\. The Nakshatras (Table III) must be considered as follows: The
bride's asterism should be counted from that of the bridegroom, and the
number be divided by nine. If the remainder be three, five or seven, it
is a sign of bad fortune; and *vice versa* with all others. Similarly
the bridegroom's lunation should be counted from the bride's; and if,
after dividing as before by nine, the remainders of both parties
indicate good fortune, this counts as three Gunas, the maximum. Only if
one portend well, it counts as one Guna and a half: otherwise there is
no Guna.

4\. Class. Perfect friendship counts for four Gunas; common friendship
as three, indifference as two; enmity as one, an exceeding enmity as
half a Guna. Perfect friendship can subsist only between two human
beings of the same caste. Cows and buffaloes, elephants and rams, live
in common friendship. Cows and tigers, horses and buffaloes' lions and
elephants, rams and monkeys, dogs and deer, cats and mice, snakes and
ichneumons are exceedingly inimical. Common enmity and indifference are
easily exemplified by the lives of ordinary men and beasts.

5\. Planets. If the presiding planets of both persons be the same, and
there be perfect friendship, this counts for five Gunas; or four if only
common friendship. If there be friendship with an enemy of the other
person it reduces the value to one Guna, and if both have such
friendship to one half. In cases of mutual indifference the Gunas amount
to three, and if there be mutual enmity there is no Guna.

6\. Groups as in Table III. If both belong to the same group, six Gunas
are present; also if the bridegroom belong to the god-group and the
bride to the man-group. The reverse reduces it five: if the bridegroom
be of demon-group, and the bride of god-group, there is only one Guna,
and in all other cases none.

7\. Kuta, that is the agreement of the zodiacal signs and asterisms of
bride and bridegroom. It is of two kinds, auspicious and ill-omened. The
Kuta is fortunate if the bride and bridegroom be born in the same sign,
but in different asterisms, or in the same asterisms, but in different
signs, or, lastly, in the same asterisms but in different quarters. A
difference of seven asterisms is also auspicious; for instance, if the
bridegroom's asterism be Ashvini (Table III), and that of the bride
Pushya. The same is the case with three, four, ten and eleven asterisms,
and with a second sign from an even sign; for instance, Cancer being the
fourth is an even sign, and if the sign of one party be Cancer and the
other Virgo, the Kuta is auspicious. This is also the case with a sixth
sign from an even sign; and an eighth and a twelfth from an odd sign.
But a second sign, a fifth, a sixth, a ninth, and a twelfth from an odd
sign, and an eighth from an even sign, are unfortunate Kutas. The Gunas
of Leo and Virgo are both auspicious. If there be a fortunate Kuta, and
the sign of the bridegroom be remote from that of the bride, and if
there be enmity between the classes of the two, this conjunction will
represent six Gunas. If there be the same sign and different asterisms,
or the same asterism and different signs, the Gunas number five. In an
unfortunate Kuta if there be friendship between the classes of the
postulants, and the bride's asterism be remote from that of the
bridegroom this counts for four Gunas; but if there be only a single
condition, it reduces the requisites to one. In all other cases there is
no Kuta.

8\. The Nadi or point of time. If the Nadis of the bride and bridegroom
be different, as *e.g.*, first and last, first and middle, last and
middle, this conjunction represents eight Gunas. The requisites are nil
when the Nadi is the same.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_97"></span>[1](ar12.htm#fr_97) We have relegated the
astrological and chemical chapters to an appendix. They appear (pp. 120
et seq.) in the Maratha Edit. of the Ananga-Ranga (Bombay, 1842); but it
is more than doubtful if they belong to the original work.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[2](ar12.htm#fr_98) As mere children are married
in India these precautions and considerations must be taken by the
relatives. See the beginning of Chapter VIII.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[3](ar12.htm#fr_99) The fault of families is
hereditary ill-repute: the greatest blemish of names is when those of
bride and bridegroom exactly correspond, and those of disposition are
too well known to require notice.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[4](ar12.htm#fr_100) The signs and asterisms
are set down in the horoscopes, which arc drawn up at the child's birth
by competent inquirers.
