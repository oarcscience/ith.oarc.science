# INTRODUCTION

MAY you be purified by Parvati <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) who
coloured the nails of her hands, which were white like the waters of
Ganges, with lac after seeing the fire on the forehead of Shambhu; who
painted her eyes with collyrium after seeing the dark hues of Shambhu's
neck and whose body-hair stood erect (with desire) after seeing in a
mirror the ashes on Shambhu's body.

I invoke thee, O Kamadeva! thee the sportive; thee, the wanton one, who
dwellest in the hearts of all created beings;

Thou instillest courage in time of war; thou destroyedst Sambar' A'sura
and the Rakshasas; thou sufficest unto Rati <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md), and to the loves and pleasures of the
world;

Thou art ever cheerful, removing uneasiness and overactivity, and thou
givest comfort and happiness to the mind of man.

King Ahmad was the ornament of the Lodi House. He was a Sea, having for
waters the tears shed by the widows of his slaughtered foes, and he rose
to just renown and wide-spread fame. May his son Lada Khan, versed in
the Kama Shastra, or Scripture of Love, and having his feet rubbed with
the diadems of other kings, be ever victorious!

The great princely sage and arch-poet, Kalyana Malla versed in all the
arts, after consulting many wise and holy men, and having examined the
opinions of many poets, and extracted the essence of their wisdom,
composed, with a view of pleasing his sovereign, a work which was called
Ananga Ranga <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md). May it ever be
appreciated by the discerning, for it hath been dedicated to those who
are desirous of studying the art and mystery of man's highest enjoyment,
and to those who are best acquainted with the science and practice of
dalliance and love-delight.

It is true that no joy in the world of mortals can compare with that
derived from the knowledge of the Creator. Second, however, and
subordinate only to this, are the satisfaction and pleasure arising from
the possession of a beautiful woman. Men, it is true, marry for the sake
of undisturbed congress, as well as for love and comfort, and often they
obtain handsome and attractive wives. But they do not give them plenary
contentment, nor do they themselves thoroughly enjoy their charms. The
reason of which is, that they are purely ignorant of the Scripture of
Cupid, the Kama Shastra; and, despising the difference between the
several kinds of women, they regard them only in an animal point of
view. Such men must be looked upon as foolish and unintelligent; and
this book is composed with the object of preventing lives and loves
being wasted in similar manner, and the benefits to be derived from its
study are set forth in the following verses:--

"The man who knoweth the Art of Love, and who understandeth the thorough
and varied enjoyment of woman;

"As advancing age cooleth his passions, he learneth to think of his
Creator, to study religious subjects, and to acquire divine knowledge:

"Hence he is freed from further transmigration of souls; and when the
tale of his days is duly told, he goeth direct with his wife to the
Svarga (heaven)."

And thus all you who read this book shall know how delicious an
instrument is woman, when artfully played upon; how capable she is of
producing the most exquisite harmony; of executing the most complicated
variations and of giving the divinest pleasures.

Finally, let it be understood that every Shloka (stanza) of this work
has a double signification, after the fashion of the Vedanta, and may be
interpreted in two ways, either mystical or amatory.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1](ar02.htm#fr_0.md) The mountain-goddess of many
names, wife of Shiva, the third person of the Hindu Trinity, who is here
termed Shambhu for Swayambhu, the Self-Existent. The invocation is
abrupt and does not begin with the beginning, Ganesha (Janus), Lord of
Incepts, who is invariably invoked by the Hindu, that he may further the
new undertaking. This god is worshipped under the form of a short stout
man, with an elephant's trunk and protuberant belly. (See Vol. III, P.
38, "A View of the History, Literature, and Mythology of the Hindus," by
William Ward, of Serampore, London, 1832.) The loves of Krishna and the
sixteen thousand milkmaids are recorded in the Bhagavat; this eleventh
incarnation of Vishnu is a dark-blue man, playing with both hands upon
the pipe, whilst Radha, his wife, stands his left side. Kamadeva, or the
Hindu Cupid, the son of Bramha, is represented as a beautiful youth, the
most lovely of all the gods, holding a bow and flower-tipped arrow, with
which, while wandering through perfumed glades, accompanied by Rati, his
spouse, he wounds the hearts of the inhabitants of the Triloka or Three
Worlds. Sir William Jones says that he appears to correspond with the
Greek Eros and the Roman Cupido, but that the Indian description of his
person and arms, his family, attendants and attributes has new and
peculiar beauties. Sambar' A'sura was one of the Rakshasas, gigantic and
diabolical beings, whom Kama slew.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2](ar02.htm#fr_1.md) The Sakit, or female
principle, representing the aptitude of conception and continuation,
becomes the wives of the gods in Hindu mythology. Thus in the
Shavya-Purana, Shiva says, "from the supreme spirit proceed Parusha"
(the generative or male principle), "and Parkriti" (the productive, or
female principle), "and by them was produced the universe, the
manifestation of the one god." For its origin we must go back to the
Chaldaeo-Babylonian System.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3](ar02.htm#fr_2.md) This title has been explained:
see also Ward III. 179. Kama was the son of Maya (= Illusion, the
attracting powers of Matter, Maia the mother of Mercury), he married
Rati (Affection, vulgarised in our "rut") and is bosom-friend to
Vasanta, Basant or Spring.
