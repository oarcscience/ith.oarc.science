# CHAPTER VI

### TREATING OF VASHIKARANA

VASHIKMUNA is the art by which man or woman is rendered submissive and
obedient to the fascinator, who for that purpose uses certain drugs and
charms. And first the magic "Talaka." <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

### First Prescription

The holy sage Vatsyayana Muni <span id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28.md) hath
declared that whosoever will take the powder of sensitive plant, the
root of green lotus-flowers, the Bassia latifolia, and barley-flower;
and, after mixing it up with some of his own Kama-salila, will apply it
as a sectarian mark to his forehead, such an one will subdue the world
of women, and she who looks upon his brow cannot fail to feel for him
the most eager desire.

### Second Prescription

The man who will levigate the root of the giant Asdepias, the Jatamansi,
or spikenard (*valeriana latamansi*), Vekhand, the sweet-smelling grass
Nagarmotha (*cyperus pertenuis* or *juncifolius*), and costus with the
blood from a woman's Yoni, and apply it to his forehead, shall ever be
successful in the affairs of love, and shall enjoy a long course of
happiness.

### Third Prescription

The man who will take equal parts of Tagar (a flowering plant, *taberna
montana* or *coronaria asarobacca*), of Pimpalimull (the root of *piper
dichotonium*, or long pepper), of Mendha-shinghi (a plant whose fruit is
compared with goat-horns or crab-claws), and of Indian spikenard; mix
them together and knead them with honey, to which is added his
Kama-salila, or with any of the other five Mala (secretions of the
body); that man will find that such a mixture applied to his forehead
will enable him to overcome and subdue the women of the world.

The following recipe will enable a woman to attract and preserve her
husband's love:

Moisten Gorochana in the blood which appears every month, and apply it
to the forehead as a "Tilak"; as long as it is there and the man looks
upon it, so long shall he be in her power.

The following are "Anjan", or magical collyriums for winning love and
friendship:

### First

Take a human skull from the cemetery or burning ground on the eighth day
of the moonlit fortnight of the seventh month Ashvini
(September-October), expose it to fire, and collect the soot upon a
plate held over it; let this be drawn over the inner surface of the
eye-lids, instead of the usual antimony, and the effect will be to
fascinate every one. <span id="fr_29"></span>[3](#fn_29.md)

### Second

Take bamboo-manna, Naga-keskar (*messua ferrea*) <span
id="fr_30"></span>[4](#fn_30) Korphad (*aloe perfoliata*.md) and Manshila
(red sulphuret of arsenic); reduce them to powder, sift, and use as
collyrium; the wearer's eyes will attract the hearts of all.

### Third

Take wood of the Tad-palm (toddy-tree), costus, and Tagar-root, levigate
in water, and with the latter moisten a piece of silk stuff; convert
this into wicks with Shiras-oil, light them and take the soot formed
upon a human skull in a cemetery, when held above the lamp; this is a

collyrium, which will make every one who looks upon it the servant or
slave of the wearer.

### Fourth

Take Manshil, Naga-keshar, Kala-umbar (the fruit of *ficus glomerosa*)
and bamboo-sugar, and make a collyrium when the Pushya-asterism falls
upon a Sunday; its effect will be greatly to increase the mutual love of
husband and wife.

The following three prescriptions are powerful in reducing other persons
to submission:

### First

If a powder made of the Kang, or white panic (*p. italicum*), white
Nishottar (*thomea turpethum*), the wing of the Bhramra-bee, costus,
lotus flower, and Tagar-root, be thrown upon a man, it will at once have
the effect of fascination.

### Second

If a powder, made of Vatalu leaves, of Soma-valli (the moon-plant,
*asclepias acida*, or *sarcostema viminalis*), and of a garland or
rosary placed upon a dead body, and mingled with a little of the man's
own Kama-salila, be thrown upon a person, the latter will be surely
subdued.

### Third

If a powder, made with equal quantities of the Satavina-Vrisksha (the
"seven-flowered tree", *astonia scholaris* or *echites*), of the
Rudraksha (*cleocarpus lanceolatus*, or Ganitrus, a tree sacred to
Shiva), and of the seeds of San (Bengal "sun"), be used as before, it
will have even a greater effect. This is perhaps the most potent
compound for fascinating others.

### A Philter-Pill (Vatika)

On any Tuesday, take out the bowels of the blue jay (*coracias indica*),
and let some of the fascinator's own Kama-salila be placed inside the
body; put the latter into an earthen pot, cover it with a second pot
whose bottom must be turned upwards, lute with cloth and clay, and keep
in a solitary place for seven days; then take out the contents, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[5](#fn_31.md) pound, reduce to fine powder, make
pellets, or pills, and dry them. If one of these be given to a woman,
she will be subject to a man, and vice versa.

### Another Charm

The man who, after enjoying his wife, catches some of his own
Kama-salila in his left hand, and applies it to her left foot, will find
her entirely submissive to his win.

### Another Charm

The woman who before congress will touch with her left foot the Linga of
her husband, and will make a practice of this, undoubtedly subdues him,
and makes him her slave for life.

### Another Charm

Let a man take of the egesta of the spotted-necked pigeon; rock-salt,
and the leaves of the Bassia latifolia in equal parts, powder them, and
rub the powder upon his Linga before congress, he will become the
woman's master.

### Another Charm

Let a man levigate together Kasturi (common musk, also applied to a kind
of camphor) and wood of the yellow Tetu-tree; mix them with honey two
months old, and apply the substance to his Linga before congress, it
will have the same effect.

### A Fascinating Incense, or Fumigation

Pound well together sandal-wood, Kunku (red powder prepared from
turmeric and alum coloured with lemon-juice and other matters), costus,
Krishnaguru (black sanders), Suvasika-puspha (perfumed flowers?), white
vala (the fragrant *andropogon muricatum* and the bark of the Deodaru
pine; and, after reducing them to fine powder, mix it with honey and
thoroughly dry. It is now known as Chintamani-Dhupa, the
"thought-mastering incense". If a little of this be used according to
the ceremonies prescribed, he who employs it will make all the world
submissive to him.

### Another Incense

Pound and mix together equal quantities of cardamom-seeds, Olibanum (or
gum benzoin), the plant Garur-wel Moon-seed, *monispermum glabrum*, or
*cocculus cardifolius*, sandal-wood, the flowers of the eared jasmine,
and Bengal madder. This incense is powerful as that above given.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_27"></span>[1](ar08.htm#fr_27.md) This is a round sectarian
mark, about the size of a wafer, which the Hindu applies to his
forehead, after certain rites and prayers. The reader will find this
chapter interesting on account of the various abominations which it
contains. The underlying idea appears to be that if any secretion of the
body, the fouler the better, can be secretly administered to a person of
either sex, the result is the subjection of the patient to the
adhibitor. The European reader will hardly believe how extensively this
practice is carried out all over the East. No Persian will drink sherbet
in the house of his future mother-in-law; and Jewish women, who are
especially addicted to these practices, will mix their monthly blood in
the philters which they give to men.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[2](ar08.htm#fr_28.md) The reader can now consult
the Kama Sutra of the Sage Vatsyayana, translated from the Sanskrit in
seven Parts, gr. in 8vo, with Preface, Introduction and concluding
remarks, *Benares, printed for the Hindoo Kama Shastra Society*, 1883.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[3](ar08.htm#fr_29.md) Nothing in Hindu eyes can be
more impure or sacrilegious than such an act as this; the people having,
as a rule, the highest reverence for the body from which life has
departed. And the horror of the thing is, of course, the secret of its
power.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[4](ar08.htm#fr_30.md) Others translate "Cassia
buds."

<span id="fn_31"></span>[5](ar08.htm#fr_31.md) These, of course, would be
putrid in an Indian climate.
