The dominant world religions treat sexuality as (at best) a distraction
from the spiritual path. On the other hand, some spiritual traditions
integrate sexuality into their spiritual practice. Some regard sexuality
as an integral part of life, a gift to be honored and enjoyed. This
section contains classic texts which discuss the sacred nature of
sexuality and affirm the positive aspects of sex. Some of these texts
([the Tantric](../tantra/index).md) are esoteric and touch on the
intersection of the spiritual and the physical. Others (such as the Kama
Sutra material) are more rooted in the physical world.

### Tantra

[Tantra now has its own category](../tantra/index.md).

<span id="kamasutra"></span>

### Kama Sutra

In addition to Tantra, which attributes a spritual dimension to
sexuality, India has produced a rich literature of sophisticated sex
manuals. In spite of their *practical* nature, they demonstrate how
Indian culture integrated sexuality into everyday life, (including
religion and spirituality). This knowledge was supposed to be part of
the repetoire of any intelligent and well-educated adult. Several of
these were translated in the Victorian Era by freethinking Orientalists.

#### About these translations

These translations (as well as the Perfumed Garden and the Priapeia)
were produced by Sir Richard Burton and Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot and
published by the Kama Shastra Society (founded 1882).

Sir Richard Burton \[1821-1890\] (not to be confused with the screen
actor) was an orientalist and daring explorer. Fluent in Arabic and
Islamic culture, Burton was the first Westerner to enter Mecca (in
disguise). He is also known for his unexpurgated translation of the
[Arabian Nights](../neu/burt1k1/index.md).

F.F. Arbuthnot did most of the actual work of the translations of the
Indian works, while working for the Indian Civil Service in Bombay from
1868 to 1879. He was able to consult original texts of the Kama Sutra
and Ananga Ranga and discuss their contents with Indian scholars.

The texts were printed 'for private circulation only' -- a disclaimer
required in the stifling atmosphere of Victorian England.

### Sacred Sexuality in the Ancient World

In the late 18th century, classical scholars began to take note of a
phenomena which they termed 'Priapus worship'. This was a complex of
religious ideas in antiquity including phallic votive objects, fertility
ceremonies, sacred prostitution, female and hermaphroditic creator
deities, and other heterodox aspects of ancient religion. Much of this
information had been surpressed or ignored.

detail the sexual practices of the classical Pagans, including a
vocabulary of dozens of Latin terms for male and female genitalia and
short essays about classical references to anal and oral sex,
bestiality, exotic dancers, masturbation, sex positions, and the
lascivious behavior of the Gods and Goddesses. These appendices were so
shocking that Burton disavowed any connection with the book, in spite of
obvious internal evidence that he is the co-author. </span>

### Modern Rediscovery

In the 19th century a number of pioneering sexologists started to
independently rediscover the basic principles of sacred sexuality that
were known in India many millenia ago.

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[Male Continence](mc/index.md)</span>

class="c_d">1872</span>\]   <span class="c_b">John Noyes was the founder
of the Oneida colony, a group which somewhat successfully abolished
marriage</span>. They outlasted many of the other utopian experiments of
the time. Oneidans used a technique called 'Male Continence' as a form
of birth control, but has some interesting side-effects, as Tantric
practitioners discovered long ago. </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[Karezza, Ethics of
