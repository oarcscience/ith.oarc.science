# AUTHOR'S AFTERWORD

SPEAKING to an educated woman of the ancient meaning and remarkable
origin of the cross, she inquired, "What, the cross of Christ?" Her
unconsciousness that it had any other relation than that pertaining to
the crucifixion of Jesus illustrates a prevailing lack of historical
knowledge in most people throughout Christendom. The hope to bring
within the reach of the average man of letters a chapter of mythological
lore which has heretofore been confined to the few is one motive for
offering these pages to the public.

There is no truth but is productive of good. The dynamics of knowledge
are impatient of rest and mental inertia. Science and historical
criticism are opening many fields long hid in myth and conjecture.

It is hoped the line of discussion here adopted will explain some
portions of Bible literature which have always stood in the attitude of
offensive enigma to cultured thought. Improved taste of modern time must
question the crudities of former days, and ask the reason why. Natural
forces give direction to usage, and type to habits. The same agencies
modify and polish them. The hallowed powers of one era become. detritus
of a later one; and in still later eons of time those decayed objects
reappear as relies, and show, to our surprise, how

much that is held to be original in our age is really the unconscious
inheritance of a bygone ancestry. They also show early religious ideas
were cast in a mold denoting a childlike apprehension, in conformity
with things palpable, and roundly pronounced, with the child's direct
bluntness of expression.

Ancient religious literature is conspicuous for the number of Gods held
in veneration. We find in Christendom but three, or, at most, four.
Explanation of the "Trinity" and the natural origin of those four great
creative, all-absorbing Gods are here elucidated upon historic and
well-nigh scientific bases. As all science demands illustrations
addressed to the eye, as well as argument to the mental perception, so,
in the treatment of our theo-scientific theme, over twenty-five
illustrations are introduced to aid the text.

The Phallic and Yonijic remains found in California, are in these pages,
for the first time, so fur as known to the author, introduced to public
attention as ancient religious relies belonging to the prehistoric stone
age.

Those who have perused Inman's "Ancient Faiths," Higgins' "Anacalypsis"
and his "Celtic Druids," Payne Knight's "Worship of Priapus," Layard's
"Nineveh," papers of Dr. G. L. Ditson and others relating to kindred
subjects, know the authentic sources of much of the information here
briefly uttered.
