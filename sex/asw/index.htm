<P>This short book on ancient 'Phallic worship', as the
Victorians called it, contains much which is covered in
the other entries in this literature.
Jennings has a compelling thesis about the role of sexuality
in ancient religions and their modern successors which
bears careful examination.
There is also a lot of speculation, incorrect information, 
conclusion-leaping and questionable etymology.</P>

<P>
Jennings places an inordinate amount of signficance
on anything that is vaguely phallic looking or resembles a vagina.
This includes pawn shop signage, tortise heads,
arched doors, lozange-shaped design elements, and so on.
While some of this is revealing and possibly valid,
he finishes off by pegging a fairly
standard native Californian mortar and pestle as
a set of ritual phallic symbols.
There are examples <I>ad nauseum</I> of these items
in the anthropologicial and archeological literature of California,
and none of them have ever been associated
with sex-worship to my knowledge.
Sometimes a pestle is just a pestle....

Hargrave Jennings also wrote <A HREF="../../sro/rrm/index.htm">The Rosicrucians,
their Rites and Mysteries</A>, also available online at Intangible Textual Heritage,
where he goes into much more detail on the subject of phallic worship.
