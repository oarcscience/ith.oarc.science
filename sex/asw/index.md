This short book on ancient 'Phallic worship', as the Victorians called
it, contains much which is covered in the other entries in this
literature. Jennings has a compelling thesis about the role of sexuality
in ancient religions and their modern successors which bears careful
examination. There is also a lot of speculation, incorrect information,
conclusion-leaping and questionable etymology.

Jennings places an inordinate amount of signficance on anything that is
vaguely phallic looking or resembles a vagina. This includes pawn shop
signage, tortise heads, arched doors, lozange-shaped design elements,
and so on. While some of this is revealing and possibly valid, he
finishes off by pegging a fairly standard native Californian mortar and
pestle as a set of ritual phallic symbols. There are examples *ad
nauseum* of these items in the anthropologicial and archeological
literature of California, and none of them have ever been associated
with sex-worship to my knowledge. Sometimes a pestle is just a
pestle....

Hargrave Jennings also wrote [The Rosicrucians, their Rites and
Mysteries](../../sro/rrm/index.md), also available online at Intangible
Textual Heritage, where he goes into much more detail on the subject of
phallic worship.
