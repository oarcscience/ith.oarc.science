### THE PHALLUS IN CALIFORNIA.

SEX worship being the most natural, the most personal or self-relating,
and ever associated with physical maturity, we may safely conclude it to
have had spontaneous origin in widely [separated](errata.htm#2.md)
localities. As it arose in India it may have likewise arisen elsewhere.
At all events, we believe India and the East are not the only places
where the vestiges of it are found. There is reason to think the
aboriginal people of California had phallic and yonigic usages, if those
usages did not amount to a religious faith. In support of this view
several stone relics of antiquity give evidence, if it be proper to base
a conclusion upon the study of a few specimens.

inspect was a stone phallus I obtained on the Big Solado Creek in the
foot-hills of Stanislaus County, California. It is cylindrical in shape,
nearly sixteen inches long, and two and a quarter inches in diameter.
The second one is represented in the cut, [Fig. 25](#img_fig25.md). It is
formed of basaltic rock, is eighteen inches in length, and two and one
fourth inches in diameter at the largest part. These are commonly called
"Indian pestles." But this appears to be a swift and too easy
conclusion. To be so carefully wrought out of obdurate rock for the
object of pestles implies a poor adaptation to the supposed use. It
elevates the autochthon's constructive above his applied skill. These
phalli show no marks of wear, the larger ends having the same appearance
of disuse as the smaller. A specific feature denoting weighty proof that
our specimens are sexual emblems of the male organ cannot be overlooked.
Near the summit of the lesser end of [Fig. 25](#img_fig25.md) is a
well-defined depressed line which typifies [the](errata.htm#3.md) adult
uncircumcised prepuce, in semi-recession upon the glands.

C. C. Jones ("Antiquities of Southern Indians") says: "The worship of
Priapus probably obtained among some of the Southern Indian nations. In
the collection of Dr. Troost were many carefully carved representations
in stone of the male organ of generation."

Another point worthy of note is the fact that the length of the
so-called pestles exceeds that of nearly every other celt, as figured by
Lubbock, Evans, or Jones.

\[paragraph continues\] The latter depicts a stone ax and handle in one
piece, fifteen and three fourths inches long; a spade and handle, cut
from solid rock, seventeen and a quarter inches long. Only one specimen
has a length greater then the phalli; that is a flint sword which
measures a little over twenty-one inches long.

Like all Gods, the parts which make the person are human or mundane; the
divinity, thereof consists in office and proportion. To be godlike,
those proportions must be exorbitant, as we not only here, witness, but
as may be seen in most of the virile members figured on the bass-reliefs
exhumed from the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. All present
the same excess in the divine gift of magnitude--a never-failing
attribute of the Almighty.

[Fig. 26](#img_fig26.md) is a unique specimen, the original of which
accompanied [Fig. 25](#img_fig25.md). They are both in the collection of
the Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, Cal., but without history
except such as may be read from each as an individual fact. This
oval-shaped relic has been denominated a "mortar." But that term seems a
misnomer. The object departs from the type of the mortar. Other vessels
in the collection that are unquestioned mortars have a less elaborate
finish, and all strictly conform to the one idea of rough utility. This
specimen ([Fig. 26](#img_fig26).md) is fourteen inches long, nine inches
broad, and six inches high. It is not polished, but it has all even
smoothness on the outer surface. The oblong cavity, which is nearly
three inches deep, allows quite sharp pits

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

of hammer or delving tool marks, which in the mortars proper these marks
are very much effaced, as if by attrition of use. The base of the
mortars have each a consistent flat bottom to rest on, while the
underside of the celt in question is oval, making it unstable as an egg.

I find no diagram or description of a stone relic of this kind in Sir
John Lubbock's "Prehistoric Times," Evans' "Stone Relies of England," or
C. C. Jones, Jr.'s "Antiquities of Southern Indiana."

Though the direct evidence is small, the foregoing indirect evidence
leads us to regard the relic purely a sacred emblem of the female type,
answering to the yoni of India, and a companion to the phallus.
