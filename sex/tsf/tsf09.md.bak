#### I

WE are leaving Baal with the setting sun and following the spreading
shadows down to the chambers of Aphrodite. Baal will ever dwell in our
memory associated with daylight and sunshine, with gladness and the joy
of living. Man showed himself naked before his god. He had nothing to
hide, nothing to crouch before. In the temple of Baal, he stood squarely
upon the ground, filling his lungs with the breath of life and extending
his arms in welcome to the entire world. In Baal, man's ego opened to
include the universe.

Aphrodite we shall learn to associate with night and darkness. Aphrodite
was so great a mother that all her children appeared puny and
insignificant before her. Man came into the world out of a woman and was
forever longing for his native land. In Aphrodite, he hoped at least
symbolically to return whence he had come.

There were two ways in which man could realize himself: one was to
absorb the universe within him; the other was to dissolve himself in the
universe. Baal was the first attempt, Aphrodite the second.
Consequently, Baal was the god eternal, but Aphrodite was eternity
itself.

Baal was light; Aphrodite was darkness. Darkness was

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

at the beginning of creation; darkness will be at its end. It seems to
be the natural, permanent condition, with daylight its only break.
Baal-Shamash, the sun-god, rises every morning from his nightly
hiding-place and, seating himself in his chariot, drives across the
sky—a chariot of fire over a field of darkness. But as he reaches the
horizon, he returns to his abode, and night, no longer disturbed,
continues to prevail.

Baal-Shamash is a god and immortal, yet once a year he dies, only to be
resurrected and to return to life again. Aphrodite never dies. It is she
who goes down to the lower regions to find the god and to bring him back
into the world of the living. Baal is the living god; Aphrodite is life
itself. Baal is the green leaf, the stalk sprouting out of the ground;
Aphrodite is the black soil that holds within itself the force of life
and its secret, the source whence all comes and to which all returns in
the end.

We are drawing closer to Aphrodite, the eternal feminine. As we look
upon her through the eyeglass of thought and understanding, we see the
goddess complete in herself. She is both male and female—a bearded face
with full maiden breasts; in female dress yet with a sceptre in her
hand, the lingam symbol of the male. Aphrodite knows no sex, but
sexuality. They who come to worship her must hide their sex. Males come
in female attire and females in the clothes of males. The greatest glory
they can bring to Aphrodite, the overpowering devotion to the goddess
that only the chosen ones attain, is to physically efface their sex.
When the human being reaches the stage in which he is neither man nor
woman, then he is in closest tune with the spirit of the great goddess
of love.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

However, that was the goal of only a few pining souls. The vast number
of Aphrodite's worshippers had nothing further from their minds than to
mutilate themselves. They saw another way of communion with their
goddess. The sexes in mating resemble Aphrodite; they attain that
supreme unity which is the harmony of nature and the creative force of
life. For originally, life was but one sex; only in time the unit was
broken into halves, each longing for the other. When the two find
themselves and reunite, the original union is restored and happiness is
born.

And yet, very few were conscious of these thoughts as they carried their
sacrifices into the chamber of Aphrodite. They merely came to her like
children calling upon their mother. There, under the roof of the goddess
of creation, they heard the call of the creative force and responded to
it. There, heart longed for heart and flesh hungered for flesh. And as
the call was sharp and the hunger beyond control, they loosened all
bonds and plunged head and heart into the sea of love.

#### II

On our way to the chambers of Aphrodite we must first pass out of the
city, for her temple lies beyond the gate. Her abode is a city in
itself, with streets, houses, parks and shrines, enclosed within a thick
stone wall. It is a wall of demarcation between two different worlds.

Outside the wall, life is toil, worry, restraint. Without, one is
variously preoccupied with his dry, daily labor. He is limited in
activity, in movement, and in relationship with fellow men and women.
Outside, there is a world of hard, drab reality. Inside, life is one
great love-

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

feast welling with the pleasures of sense. Man appeared at his best with
the best he had when he entered the gate of the wall. He cast aside all
care and lifted all restraint. Inside, he felt like a captive prince
returning in triumph to his father's domain. Within, there was sheer
joy, bliss, one prolonged state of ecstasy, out of which he woke reborn
to a new life.

As we enter the city of Aphrodite, we see the inside of the stone wall
lined with trees and shrubbery, among which little huts of two rooms
each are arranged in a circular row. There are exactly twelve hundred
such huts with twelve hundred priestesses, a hundred for each sign of
the Zodiac, and all are on the Sacred Ring of Aphrodite, goddess of love
and passion. Each hut is the abode of a priestess, an humble yet sacred
servant, who has dedicated her life to the great function of her
goddess. The door of the hut is of red metal; over it hangs a lingam, a
hammer stuck into an anvil, the symbol of the eternal union. Above the
knob is inscribed the name of the priestess. To the right of the
entrance is her reception room and to the left an alcove where the
worshipper may spend the night.

From all parts of the world the priestesses came to these huts upon the
Sacred Ring to serve their goddess. Their skins were of different colors
and they spoke in various tongues, calling their idol by distinctive
names. Yet, there they were in the same place of worship, bedecked with
the same jewels, anointed with the same oil and exhuming the fragrance
of a perfume adopted by custom, all to honor Aphrodite.

They were mere maidens when first brought there, childish in figure and
pure of heart. Little did they know of

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

the meaning of Aphrodite's divinity or of the service they would have to
render. There was only the vague desire to be a priestess, to devote
one's life to the divine being.

<span id="img_16300"></span>

[![Priestesses of Aphrodite](tn/16300.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/16300.jpg.md)  
Priestesses of Aphrodite  

When accepted by the high-priest, the maiden was dedicated to Aphrodite
and deflowered with the sacred knife, so that her virginity might not
displease the goddess. Then she was entered in the school of love where
she was

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

taught to dress, to arrange her hair, to use perfumes and sweet-scented
powders, and to arouse the passions of man. In time, she found her way
to a room on the Sacred Ring.

The more closely the priestess devoted herself to the temple, the
further away she moved in thought and memory from her own country and
her very family. She was a maiden reborn in Aphrodite and consecrated to
the pleasures of sex. Torn away from a life in which she had been
rooted, she was not allowed to take root in another, but was left adrift
in the sea of passion. The offspring that might come to her were taken
away to be raised as servants in the temple. Seldom did she know what
became of her child. When she died, her remains were hurriedly removed
from the Sacred Ring so that death might not blot the holy ground of
life and creation.

#### III

The origin of the temple priestess was hidden in obscurity. Her end was
shrouded in darkness. But in between, there was a span of life in
glaring sunlight. No wonder, then, that there were so many young women
clamoring to be accepted in the feminine priesthood. The poor woman,
with no chance whatever to rise to distinction, saw therein the
opportunity to climb to loftier heights. The adventurous woman, destined
to live on the plane of life to which she was born, found there a chance
to get out of the rut and to advance in the affairs of men as well as in
their estimation. Many were the maidens awaiting their turn to enter the
shrine of Aphrodite. But greater were the numbers pensively turned away
by the eunuch priest. Boundless was the love of Aphrodite and great the
lust of man, but the temple grounds had their limits.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

Even among those that were accepted, favor and fortune played their
hands. Only a small number of them were consecrated at a time, and only
a few could see their own huts in the near future. Great, therefore, was
the strain that weighed down upon the virgins as the day of dedication
drew near. Many a sleepless night did they spend in wondering whom fate
would choose and what this great dedication might be like. Many were the
rumors current among them, yet they hardly conceived what they all
meant. The rumors only irritated them and fired their imaginations.

On the morning of the dedication everyone was stirring early. For hours
they carefully prepared themselves. There were baths and sacred
ablutions. There were ointments to be applied and perfumes to be used.
Each maiden was to be ready to meet the goddess, to meet her as a lover
with all the amorous preparation of the Orient. They were finally seated
in the corridor, waiting to be offered to Aphrodite. And as they waited,
a priest walked slowly about them, chanting the Song of the Lingam:

"Virgins, anoint yourselves with the costly ointments. Sweeter yet than
the Lotus be your fragrance. The sacred moment is drawing near.
Aphrodite the glorious is awaiting you. She, the mother of love and
passions, is ardently pressing upon your purple lips and mouth.

"Virgins, anoint your bodies with the costly ointment. Give yourselves
to the Lingam—only once in your lifetime. After this holy act you will
forever belong to him.

"Give yourselves to the Lingam.

"Virgins, do you feel it? The Lingam is coming down upon you. With
longing pain he is filling every beating heart.

"Virgins, do you feel it so deeply? The Lingam overwhelmed

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

you. He broke the flower—softly, like the rays of the Sun-god, the
Lingam is melting away.

"Sweet is the Lingam's boring kiss. His kiss is sweeter than honey. Once
it reaches the heart, the senses take to flight.

"Virgins, give yourselves to the Lingam."

The virgins took up the refrain, "Sweet is the Lingam's boring kiss,"
and followed the priest to the inner shrine. The room was long and
narrow. Its walls were decorated with bas-reliefs of suggestive
themes—women overpowered by animals upon a field growing the lingam and
the yoni, bacchantes embracing tigers; monstrous bulls rushing upon
virgins. A great multitude of beings, they were all driven together by
the irresistible force of overwhelming passion. The male reached out,
the female opened herself, in the fusion of those great creative forces.

Within this room the virgins now were, their bodies veiled in their
streaming hair. Marching in pairs, they approached the altar, where they
prostrated themselves and then drew back in reverence. Again, they
marched about the room to form a circle around the altar. They were to
be the living witnesses of the most sacred rite of Aphrodite: the
sacrifice of the virgin.

As if coming from nowhere the fumes of incense filled the room. In the
distance sounded the longing tones of the flute, remindful of pastures
and shepherds, of a horizon at which Father Sky kissed Mother Earth.
Then the clang of metal cut through the haze of incense. It was the
priest making ready for the sacrifice. The goddess of love, through her
minister, was now to receive a virgin into her fold.

And outside the circle of maidens, in a corner of the room, the
representatives of womanhood were preparing

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

the human partner of Aphrodite, the maiden that would soon be a maiden
no longer. Yet, she was not to offer her maidenhood to a man, not even
to a priest, but to the sacred golden knife ordained by the goddess
herself. The young virgin, delicate, childlike, was placed upon a gilded
table, her head resting upon a cushion of silk inscribed with a lotus.
The guard of honor, a number of priestesses who were themselves recent
initiates, came in their priestly attire to act as sponsors for the new
member of their order. They encircled the gilded table, leaving room for
the priest at its end.

Somewhere in the distance a horn was sounded. It was to announce that
the high-priest was coming. All eyes brightened, all cheeks flamed.
Hearts throbbed in anticipation and delight. There was a flutter in the
room but no one stirred.

As the head of the guard of honor touched her feet, the virgin closed
her eyes. There was neither fear nor apprehension in her face, but the
happy expression of ecstatic delight.

The priest raised the golden knife. The rest was a dream, a trance in
which virgin, priest and priestesses participated. They awoke only when
the girl was carried out upon the gilded table to an ante-room. They
awoke tired, exhausted, yet happy, from an experience that was not to be
had by mere mortal.

#### IV

We are now approaching still another of the sacred shrines of Aphrodite,
inclosed within tall shrubbery in the heart of the Sacred Ring. It is
the shrine of the chosen priestesses. No male ever crossed this
threshold, not even

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

priest or eunuch. Here, at last, a goddess found peace and privacy with
the intimate servants of her own sex. At last, the pure feminine
element, in communion between goddess and woman, found expression in a
service undisturbed by strangers and undefiled by profane man. Aphrodite
may not have required this feminine service, but her priestesses were
urgently in need of it.

All her life the priestess was serving others. From the moment she
entered the temple she acted as a bridge between man and her goddess.
Over her and upon her, man reached out for divine communion; she herself
never communed. Through her, souls rose to heaven; her own soul remained
hovering over the deep. She was to divine the slightest caprice of each
male who called upon her in the name of Aphrodite and to satisfy him
with all her artistry. No one ever heeded any caprice or desire of her
own refined and supersensitive self.

Hers was the life of an actress, ever upon the stage. From early morning
until late at night she was performing, doing her part with all the
talent at her command. For all the years of her study in the school of
love, like the master player, her fingers were ever at the keyboard. She
was practicing with the flute and tom-tom and cymbal: playing pieces to
soothe man's nerves after the strain and worry of the day, pieces to
arouse his longing for companionship and intimacy, and pieces to awaken
his desires and passion. The low, soft notes she accompanied with warm,
half-suppressed sighs. And from her languid eyes came tender glances of
love. At first, she may have been retiring and bashful, then desire and
impatience crept into her expression, and finally she gave herself

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

to the studied gestures of the voluptuary, dancing a pantomime of love
as she did so.

At every moment of the day the priestess was conscious of her beauty and
its pearl, her bosom. This she inclosed in gilded wooden breast-shields,
elaborately set with sparkling jewels. But through the veil that covered
her breasts, their palpitations and soft undulations were visible and,
with her sighs of passion, contributed to the general voluptuousness.
She was ever studying the effect of her perfumes, the charm of her long
black hair falling in waves over her ivory shoulders or collected in
tresses and ornamented with jewels and fresh flowers. Like the
fortune-teller, she was to divine from the twinkling of an eye, or the
quiver of a muscle in the face of her worshipper whether she was
proceeding along the path of love to which he was accustomed, the love
that pleased him most and called forth his greatest devotion to
Aphrodite.

At times, she was called upon to give delight, not to one individual
worshipper, but to the pious congregation at the gate of the shrine. She
then appeared at the door of the temple in soft, flowing veils which
slowly, almost invisibly, faded away from her body, and she stood before
them statue-like—a perfect nude veiled only in the soft waves of her
hair. For a brief moment the amazed and panting onlookers were
overwhelmed with admiration for her god-like figure. Then, like a dark
cloud passing over the sun, a purple curtain was drawn before her and
she disappeared in all her nudity.

Again, she may have appeared on the steps of the temple where her body,
resplendent in the sunlight, shone like marble. This time she advanced
to the shore of the bay, where amidst throngs of fervent admirers
sending

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

up shouts of enthusiasm, she entered the waves to honor her goddess—the
goddess born out of the foam of the deep. Withdrawing from the waves,
she returned as

<span id="img_17000"></span>

[![Hers was the life of an actress, ever upon the stage](tn/17000.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/17000.jpg.md)  
Hers was the life of an actress, ever upon the stage  

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aphrodite born a
second time. And as she stood for a moment upon the golden sand, her
body, glistening with drops of water, appeared as a pale pink statue
against a curtain of vivid blue.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

But it was all for man and all for Aphrodite. The priestess was
fulfilling a mission; herself, she was hardly a partner to all her
experiences. In the midst of the greatest joy she may have brought to
man, she herself was often in sadness. She had been instructed not to
seek her own personal pleasure. She had been taught to disregard the
personal element, the individual of the opposite sex.

There are footsteps. A knock upon her door.. Someone is coming. She is
not to consider who or what he may be. He is a worshipper at the altar
of Aphrodite, and she is his priestess. She is to dedicate herself to
his sex, not to him. And yet, only human as she is, how can she refrain
from looking at the person, at his face, or listening to his voice? Is
not sex itself a bordering on love?

From the time she came out of the school of love, she was a bundle of
nerves, ever seeking new sensations, new sources of passion and luxury.
She was the priestess of Aphrodite, yet she, too, was human; she, too,
needed a god or a goddess for her own soul to be saved from the tedium
and hopelessness of life. No wonder, then, that at times the priestess
turned to Aphrodite, not in the interest of the males with whom she
shared her bed, but on her own behalf. And what other god or goddess
could so well understand the heart of the priestess as Aphrodite
herself? Was not her own fate similar to the fate of her priestess? It
was sex that made a priestess out of the virgin. Sex, too, made
Aphrodite a goddess.

Every priestess knew the story of Aphrodite. She saw it illustrated upon
the walls of the sacred shrine. There she saw the great, youthful god,
Anu, making love to the beautiful goddess Banu. This aroused the
jealousy and wrath of Manu, who, when night came, fell upon Anu and

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

killed him. He chopped his body into pieces, scattering them all over
the world. His lingam he threw into the river, and as it sank, foam
formed upon the waters, silvery in the moonlight. Out of this foam
Aphrodite came into the world. In it she had her being and in it her
whole life was engulfed. Like her priestess, Aphrodite's existence was
rotating about the sex of man.

So, to Aphrodite's shrine every priestess betook herself whenever her
heart was heavy laden and she was in need of solace. Every night she
could come here, every night save one, the night of the full moon, when
the sanctuary was reserved for the chief priestesses of whom there were
eighteen. These lived close about the shrine. They were masters in the
art of voluptuousness. Their names were born on the lips of the greatest
of men, and they acquired wealth no less than fame. They had their own
way of finding joy and bliss. It was a secret that they alone knew and
that could only be surmised by those aspiring to be included, some day,
among the great eighteen.

These women from their early youth had devoted themselves to the art of
voluptuaries. So intensely were they centered upon the sensuous that
their imaginations made them lose their senses. They were forever
struggling with lasciviousness, always endeavoring to attain a beautiful
physique. Here they were in the sanctuary of their goddess—a sacred
place where no male ever entered. Here they were forever seeing their
own nudity and that of their companions. And deprived of natural sexual
pleasures, they created for themselves tastes and desires that grew into
passions for their very companions. The unnatural passions thus awakened
among these sex-hungry women were fierce, overpowering, and implacable.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

It was at their feasts that these chosen priestesses gave themselves up
to desire. It was then that, fired with jealousy and rivalry, they held
their combats of beauty. On the nights of the full moon, the eighteen
met in the sacred shrine of Aphrodite. They gathered in the innermost
chamber where there were no windows and but two doors. Through one door
they all entered; through the same door all were to depart, all save
one. For one must die before the night of the full moon ends, and she
will be carried away through the other door—the door through which no
one departs alive. The door of death.

The floor of the chamber was covered with hides of tigers and leopards,
and silk cushions were scattered here and there. In the center, there
was a divan with a small triangular table upon which stood a goblet
containing a deadly potion. On another table near by there were
sacramental drinks and aphrodisiacs.

No one knew what was going on here on this fateful night. One of the
eighteen that participated could not tell, the remaining seventeen would
not. So here the story must end. The end of a mystic night of love in
which eighteen worn, neurotic, and oversexed women sought, without men,
to drink the cup of love to its very last drop—and to the final breath
of one of them.

And here both life and death met in the mystic union of love. For love
was at the beginning and love will be at the end. What could be a more
beautiful finale for love than death—the end of all? It was but another
manifestation of the goddess: Aphrodite supervising the exit from life
as well as the entrance to it; Aphrodite, goddess of love and life—in
its complete cycle from birth to death.

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

#### V

We have still to visit the chambers of Aphrodite herself. Here all may
come, for she is goddess to all. She is the goddess universal, bringing
life and blessing to all creatures upon earth.

The walls are bare in the holiest of the chambers, and the room contains
only a square bench, an altar, and the statue of the goddess, nude and
sexual, upon a pedestal of rose stone. The bench is bare and cold now,
yet once a year, in early spring, it is draped with white silk and
sprinkled at each corner with the blood of doves. A cluster of almonds
and a bunch of fig leaves are put up for a pillow, and upon the bench a
hierophant and a virgin perform the great act of unity which the goddess
herself performed with the father of gods and men. After the act, the
sheet is burned upon the altar and the maiden retires to the quarters of
the priestesses.

Now the bench is bare. Aphrodite is in no mood for such sacrifice. She
is more concerned with her son Attis whom she holds upon her hand. For
while Aphrodite is a virgin, she is also a mother. She placed a
pomegranate between her breasts and became pregnant. This was in the
month of April. Nine months later her child was born out of her side so
that it might not injure her virginity. Aphrodite is the virgin mother,
deified by all people and worshipped to this very day in every part of
the world.

The virgin goddess was immortal, living ever so long as there was love
in the world and birth and life. But her son was not so fortunate. Attis
felt the mystic urge to break away from the living. So one day he came
to a

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

palm tree, the very symbol of virility and generation, and mutilated
himself. Attis bled to death. In his very lifeblood, in the force of
generation, this son of the goddess of life came to find his end. Attis
died with the leaf upon the tree, with the blades of grass in the field,
with all that moves and creeps upon the earth.

Like the corn in the field, the son of Aphrodite was annually interred
in the dark, cold, infernal region. This was a period of mourning for
Aphrodite, when she failed in her function of arousing passion and
inducing love. It was the time when nature was dead, lying fallow in
wait for the rebirth of Attis and spring.

As the days of Aphrodite's mourning progressed, her devoted worshippers
joined her in sadness and sorrow. They touched neither food nor drink
and abstained from sexual intercourse. They wailed and mourned and cut
their hair; they went about the hills and valleys playing their flutes
and searching for the son of their goddess who was to rise again. The
god who holds the dead in his sway was moved by this mourning of goddess
and human kind. So, upon the promise that the son of Aphrodite would
return to his kingdom as the year went by, he raised the bars that
separate the lower world from the one above.

Meanwhile, the priests of Aphrodite were preparing for the return of
Attis and life and love. A palm tree was cut in the woods and brought
into the sacred chamber. The trunk of the tree was swathed like a corpse
with woolen bands and decked with wreaths of violets, for it was the
violets that first sprang forth out of the blood of Attis. Then a young
priest, a youthful servant of the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

goddess resembling her son, was tied to the tree and left for the night.
In the morning lie was found stabbed, still tied to the tree.

<span id="img_17600"></span>

[![Lamenting for Attis](tn/17600.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/17600.jpg.md)  
Lamenting for Attis  

This was the Day of the Blood. The sight of the dead priest, swathed in
blood upon the sacred tree, aroused others to give of their own life
fluid for the sake of the son of their goddess. The high-priest drew
blood from

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

his arms and presented it as an offering. And the inferior priests,
wrought to the height of passion by the wild, barbaric music of cymbal,
drum, and flute and by the profusion of blood around them, whirled about
in furious dance. Finally, overcome by excitement, frenzied, and
insensible to pain, they savagely thrust the knives into their bodies,
gashing themselves in violence to bespatter the altar with their
spurting blood.

The frenzy and hysteria of the priests spread to the worshippers, and
many a would-be priest fell into the wave of religious excitement. He
sacrificed his virility to the goddess, dashing the severed portions of
himself against her blood-besmeared statue. There were men who had come
to the festival out of curiosity rather than devotion, and numbers of
them were caught in the raging fury. With throbbing veins and burning
eyes, they flung their garments from them and with wild shouts seized
the knives of the priests to castrate themselves upon the very spot.
Then, insensible to pain and oblivious of everything, they ran through
the streets of the Sacred Ring, waving the bloody pieces and finally
throwing them into a house they passed. It became the duty of the
households thus honored to furnish these men with female clothes, and
they, made eunuchs in the heat of religious passion, were to serve their
goddess for the rest of their lives. Their virility was destroyed in a
moment in the tumult of emotion; but their sacrifice was to be lifelong
and irrevocable.

As the night progressed, the fury of the worshippers was turned into
joy. Suddenly a light shone in the darkness. The tree was erected, the
dead priest no longer upon it. Another one resembling him was
sacrificing at the altar. Elsewhere a tomb had been opened; the son of

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aphrodite had
risen from the dead, and, as the priest touched the lips of the weeping
mourners with balm, he softly whispered in their ears the glad tidings
of salvation.

The morning was greeted with boundless glee. Universal license
prevailed. Every man might say and do what he pleased. To facilitate the
breaking of all bonds, people went about in disguise. Then the tree was
taken out of the sanctuary of the goddess and carried down the hill to
the brook where the virgins bathed before they entered the temple. There
it was washed of its blood, decorated with roses, and slowly brought
back in a procession of ease and serenity.

The blood scenes were forgotten. Even the eunuch priests were unmindful
of their wounds. The moments of extreme passion were spent. The "erotic
blood-letting" had been accomplished. Having returned to his former
freedom in love, man became himself again.
