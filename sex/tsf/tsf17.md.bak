#### I

HE, too, the African black man, belongs in the House of the Lord. To be
sure, he did not come there of his own accord. His own gods had been
stolen from him along with his freedom, and the new faith was thrust
upon him as another yoke of servitude. True, too, he still is not quite
at home with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is yet groping in his
own dark way for a god not his own. But there he is, many millions of
him, "standing in the need of prayer" and "wanting to be a Christian in
his heart," feeling that "a little talk with Jesus makes it right." For
all the ghosts of his ancestors in the bush, he visions Father Abraham
"sittin’ down side ob de Holy Lamb." For all the tom-tom music he was
wont to hear, he prays to Peter "to ring dem Bells." And for all the
fears of his primitive soul, he trembles at the thought that they
crucified his Lord Jesus and he, Jesus, "never said a mumblin’ word."

Had the black man remained upon his native soil, his heart would still
beat for another god. He might now be worshipping Onyame, the Shining
One, god of sunshine, or his children, in the form of rivers, hills and
woods, or the *abasomes*, the many lesser gods Onyame had instituted
upon

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

earth. Once Onyame was himself god to humans, kind and close at hand.
But he was too near. In the shape of the sky he lay so close upon the
earth that he interfered with a woman preparing to cook. Pounding her
yams, she continually hit him with the pestle. This was more than Onyame
would stand from humans, especially from a woman. For here was not only
injury but insult too. Onyame knew only too well what the pestle
signifies to humankind, and any god would resent such reflection upon
his virility. So he withdrew to the heavens above, keeping aloof from
humans and leaving the rule of the universe to his progeny and the
lesser gods.

Again, the black man might be kneeling before Legba, male or female,
whose image was to be found on almost every house. Legba, the male, was
powerfully built, with a knotted club in his hand, the symbol of his
creative force. Legba, the female, with more sexuality than feminine
charm, was impressive in her strong and massive figure.

Onyame was in heaven; Legba upon earth. Onyame was accessible only
through an intermediary; Legba might actually be embraced. But both were
gods, great and true. They brought joy and happiness to the fearing
hearts of black men and women. Their gods were in their own image, and
they served them as they would serve themselves. Whatever the sacrifice
to the god, beast or fruit or corn, it always ended in a feast of dance
and song. And the song of songs is ever the song of love. It was love,
boundless, physical, free and open that raised the soul of the black man
to the throne of the Shining One in the heavens above.

But soon hard times were coming for the black man. Prince Henry of
Portugal took back to Africa some Moors

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

he had captured in Spain. There, he received in return black men and
gold dust. And while these bartered souls lived and multiplied in
Seville, the Portuguese discovered the formula of turning them into
virtual gold dust. A Genoese called Columbus had wanted to exchange five
hundred Indians for live stock. Why should not a Portuguese exchange
Negroes for ducats? So they shipped the black men to Haiti and sold them
for slaves. And the first entry was made on the blackest page in the
history of the white man.

While Isabella hesitated to permit the barter of red men for oxen, and
Charles feared the fires of hell for permitting the sale of black men, a
blessed bishop of the church came to ease the troubled Christian
conscience. He was the accommodating Bishop of Chiapa, who returned to
Spain from Haiti in 1517, recommending that each Spanish resident should
have a license to import a dozen Negro slaves. Soon the concession to
import four thousand negroes annually in Haiti sold for 25,000 ducats.
Thus another lesson was learned by the cultured people of Europe: black
men could be turned not only into gold dust but even into veritable
nuggets. And a new business came into being—the traffic in slaves.

Ships commanded by silk-stockings and noblemen stopped in the lagoons
along the west coast of Africa. Strong, cruel men landed upon the shore.
They marched stealthily upon the peaceful population, setting ablaze
whole villages by night and capturing those who would escape death in
the flames. Those who were caught were kept in the hold of the ship
until it was filled. Then the vessel proudly sailed on to civilized
climes.

It was no easy task to catch the African black men in

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

the bush. It was much more difficult to deliver them in good condition.
Many died before the ship set sail; larger numbers perished during the
voyage. Less than half of those caught in the bush ever reached the
auction block. But Africa is a large continent and many are her sons.
There was no need of conserving black flesh and blood. There may have
been a lot of waste, but gold was sure to follow, for the demand was
ever growing. When George Washington retired from the presidency, his
little state of Virginia alone had more than two hundred thousand
slaves.

In the millions they were caught along the coast of Africa, these happy,
care-free black men. In the hundreds of thousands they were brought into
the Americas to build new worlds for the master of civilization and the
humble servant of God—the white-skinned man. Indiscriminately were they
caught, but even more so were they handled, bought, sold, and colonized.

And during all their long journeys, these black men packed together in
the holds of the slave ships, were nevertheless alone and isolated. For
there are countless numbers of dialects among the natives of Africa, and
seldom could one slave speak to another save in the few words of English
or Spanish they both had come to learn. And isolated as well were they
in their religion. Various were the forms of the black man's gods. The
Onyame of one slave was quite different from the Onyame of another; and
one Legba would hardly recognize his fellow god. In transit, the African
lost his tongue and his god and his love. For the males that were caught
far outnumbered the females. There were thirty thousand more men than
women slaves in Jamaica alone. And the beautiful young females, black
though they were, were first reserved for the white master.

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

There they were, on the plantations of a strange world, these black men,
mute and saddened, longing for home and god, both of which were
gradually to fade from their memory. No one ever cared to know what was
coursing through their minds as they toiled away, from early morn to
sundown, picking the snowy cotton. But minds, even black minds, are bent
on thinking, and hearts ever long and yearn. Having no language in which
to express the workings of his mind, the Negro took to singing. And,
where the song failed, the dance came to offer relief.

In the back yards of the plantations, off the fields of cotton, these
black men lived, torn away from their own gods, yet not without some
unconscious endeavor to fill the vacant places. As black night
descended, great fear overwhelmed their empty souls. It was an
accumulation of fears: the fear of the primitive man in the bush, the
fear of the man caught in the fire and thrown in chains into the hold of
a ship, the fear of pain and death that might come at any moment if the
master be in an angry mood. Not having the Lord for a shepherd, the
black man had ample reason to fear, and he had nothing to offset his
troubles but the little bits of magic that clung to his memory and grew
like a seed in his imagination. And it was upon these bits of magic that
he built up the Voodoo worship so common among the black people.

But longing held a larger place than fear in the heart of the black man.
He pined for the land of Onyame and the hut of Legba. In contrast to the
severe life and unhappy existence in the West, his African past seemed
like one glorious Paradise, out of which he had been driven by the lash
of the slave trader. If the Christian still hopes

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

for the millennium and the Jew for the return to Jerusalem, after these
many centuries, it is not strange that the

<span id="img_29400"></span>

[![A Negro god](tn/29400.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/29400.jpg.md)  
A Negro god  

longing for Africa has been a force in the life of the Negro, a force
not altogether lacking in this very day. The Negro

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

slave may have been little conscious of it, but the inner stirring of
his heart in the universal desire for spiritual freedom and communion
with God, expressed itself in his mute longing for a past he could only
vaguely remember and a land he knew only from the stories of the old
people. The black heart in the white man's home sought communion with
the mass of brother blacks under Africa's burning sun.

Along with this hazy, unconscious racial longing, there was yet another
pining for love that was never satisfied. Great was the black man's
capacity for loving and, in Africa, ample were the opportunities for
indulging in it. Here, in the cotton fields, the heart of the Negro was
hungry for love—pure physical love as well as romance, sentiment, and
attachment to an individual, all of which became the more necessary in
his harsh and unfriendly environment. The African black man was
love-starved on American soil. He had no black god to offer him relief
or to provide him with an outlet for his suppressed emotions; nor was
there a white god to take the place of Onyame and Legba in his lonely
heart.

#### II

Great as was the need for religion among the Negroes, the master long
hesitated to introduce the black soul to his white God. Would this
woolly slave become a brother in Christ? How could one keep a brother in
abject slavery? It was true that Abraham held slaves as did many another
Biblical character. Therefore, it was perfectly legitimate for a white
man in America, some three thousand years later, to keep them as well.
But the slaves of Abraham were heathens. A believer could not hold
another believer

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

in bondage. Of course, the Christian faith must be spread and all
mankind brought under the wings of the church, but not at the expense of
the plantation. The kingdom of heaven must come as soon as possible, but
not before the tobacco had been raised and the cotton picked. In the
meantime, the Negro must be kept out of the House of the Lord, lest he
turn Christian and gain his freedom.

But there are great theologians in every generation who know how to
apply religion to all necessities of life, however godless. Doctors of
the church discovered that wonderful synthesis of doing their bit by the
faith and yet keeping the cotton fields blooming. It was the simple idea
that baptism does not free slaves. True, all were brothers in Christ,
but some were white and others black, and the black ones were to serve
their white brothers in a brotherly way. A Christian could be a
slaveholder; he could also be a slave.

So it was that slavery entered the church and the slave followed the
master to the very altar of Christ. But it was not to the very same
altar. Master and slave could not properly appear together before the
Lord. One must humble himself before God, and the white man could not
humble himself in the presence of his slaves. Besides, the Negro slave
required a religion somewhat different from that of the master. If the
African black man was to enter the House of the Lord, he was to do so
through a separate door and, once inside, he was to remain in a corner
by himself.

Four years after the Pilgrims landed on the rock of Plymouth, a Negro
child was baptized and given the glorious name of William. It was the
first black soul to enter the white man's heaven. Almost a century
later, North

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Carolina passed a
law forbidding Negro churches. And the black man had a longer struggle
for admission to heaven than for freedom upon earth. The founder of the
Quakers went about the country, impressing upon the minds of his
followers their Christian duty of converting the slaves. That was about
the middle of the seventeenth century. The first year of the eighteenth
saw the incorporation of the Moravians, a society to aid the religious
institution of the established Church of England, in America. This
society was the first to formally dedicate itself to converting the
Negroes along with the Indians. In New York City, it had on its roll
fifteen hundred Negro and Indian slaves. There were many individual
attempts to spread Christianity among the black people, but only too
often they were wrecked on the rocks of slavery, or ruined by the fears
of the slaveholder for his property.

The colonists themselves did not raise a finger to spread the Christian
religion among the black men. All such endeavors came from without. It
remained for the Baptists, a group of people that, as a rule, kept no
slaves and could, therefore, be hostile to slavery, to start the Negro
well on the way to Christ. They trained Negro preachers for Negro
communities before the American Revolution, and the very year of the war
saw the first formal organization of Negro Christians. The first Negro
church was Baptist.

There was an additional reason why the Baptist church came to gain a
foothold among the Negroes. It was not only the first and real friend of
the black man, but it was also nearer to his understanding. The
Episcopal church could not keep the Negro flock sitting passively
observing its elaborate ritual; nor was the primitive mind of the
colored worshipper affected by its prayers and devotions.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Once the Negro
came into the church he wanted to do something there. His religion must
be ever active, never passive. The Baptist, like the Methodist, gave the
black man free play in his worship. Their exercises were spontaneous,
their preaching evangelical. A black man could move and shout when he
got religion. He could give up all control of himself when he felt the
presence of his God. It was like going back to the old gods, Onyame and
Legba.

Not until after the Civil War, however, did the masses of blacks come
into the fold of the church. Today, there are probably some fifty
thousands of church organizations among the African exiles in America,
and almost as many religious edifices, with a membership of four and a
half to five million people. The black man came to his own in the
Christian church, but he gave Christianity his own individual turn. The
church little changed the character of the Negro, but the latter
modified the nature of church. In his new religion, his old yearnings
and longings found a means of expression. But the smoldering fires of
love, of freedom, and of the joy of living, bursting forth in flame once
more took on a melancholy, saddened aspect.

#### III

To the Jew, the synagogue is a house of prayer and worship for all
people. To the white Christian, the church is a place of communion with
God. To the Negro, it is the very core of his social organization. Jew
and Christian have developed a secular social life, apart from synagogue
or church. The Negro's social life is still almost entirely within the
house of worship. This fact explains the enormous church membership
among the blacks in proportion to that of the whites. It also explains
to a considerable extent

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

the appearance of numerous small congregations and religious communities
that rise up like mushrooms after the rain. The church is the club of
the black man, the modern form of the tribal meeting in Africa. Like the
tribal meeting, it deals with matters, religious, social, economic. Like
those meetings, too, it offers the emotional outlet for feeling pent-up
in the ordinary affairs of life.

The office of the minister is another hang-over from African times. In
the bush, the religious leader was also the medicine man, the magician,
the feared leader, and the social lion. The dispenser of the faith still
occupies the most exalted position in the Negro religious life. No one
is properly introduced unless he comes through the minister. No cause
will be aided without his endorsement and approval. It is the minister
who advises the ignorant, who comforts the sorrowful, who aids the
unfortunate. He is the walking encyclopedia, the fountain of all
knowledge concerning both the natural and the supernatural. He is still
the master of magic and witchcraft disguised under different names.

But even more characteristically African is the theology of the Negro
church. Formally, there is no theological difference between black and
white churches of the same denomination. A Methodist is a Methodist,
whether white or colored. But it is not the written creed in the book
that really matters in a religion, but what is accepted by the people.
Not theoretical theology, but living theology counts. And the living
theology of the Christian black man is quite distinct from that which
was laid down by the fathers of the church.

The black man is little concerned with the virgin birth of Christ. To
him this all-important dogma means little

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

indeed. He knows he is to believe that Christ came into the world by the
Holy Ghost, and he tries his utmost to believe it. But the matter does
not interest him. Virginity is no ideal of the black people. To this
day, the cousins of our Negroes on the West Coast of Africa trace the
hereditary line through the females because "one always knows who the
mother is, but who knows who the father may be?" The black people did
not pass through the stage of chivalry and the pains of spiritual love.
Their natural instincts were not held in abeyance by the false ideals of
chastity and celibacy.

Similarly, the idea of sin as a spot upon the soul that calls for
absolution, forgiveness, or redemption, is still foreign to the mind of
the Negro. The notion of sin is the product of an over-sensitive
civilization. It is the snake developing in the crack of the
personality, encouraged by inner conflict. The conflict is between man's
ideal behavior and his actual behavior, the discrepancy between one's
ethics and his instincts. In the personality of the Negro, no such crack
has as yet occurred. His ethics arc, of course, superior to his
instincts and superimposed upon them, but still the difference between
the two is slight. At least there is no developed sense of guilt or
original sin. The black man of Africa is still living in sunlight for
the joy of existence. He cannot conceive of this life as a corridor of
misery leading into a greater world.

To the man with a weak sense of sin, Christ's mission to save mankind
from its sins is necessarily of little significance. The crucifixion of
Christ by Pontius Pilate could not shock the slave who himself was being
crucified almost continually by mere individuals. What impresses the
black man most in the story of the Passion is that

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Christ never
complained, "he never said a mumblin’ word." The description of the
crucifixion in the spirituals could just as well refer to a lynching. In
comparison with the spirituals that refer to Old Testament incidents and
persons, and in proportion to the place Jesus occupies in the church,
there are mighty few religious songs in his honor. Where there is a
groping toward the notion of Jesus as a savior, the actual sentiment is
lacking. Were a white man singing "Steal Away to Jesus," he would put
boundless emotion into the song. But as the Negro sings the spiritual,
he might just as well be stealing away from the plantation to some kind
friend across the Ohio.

Neither can the Negro appreciate the Christian ideas of the Trinity and
the Virgin Mary. They are divine characters that the black man knows
formally, having been introduced to them by the minister. He may hold
them in the greatest awe and admiration, but he does not spiritually
experience them. They are not his own. He has no joys nor sorrows in
common with them to bind them closer to him. It is for this reason that
God is commonly addressed as "Lord" by the black people. The word is
impersonal; it may refer to any divine being, to any universal father.
Lord is the maker of the universe and the ruler over man. He may be
conceived in the latter's own image. He may even be a spiritualized
Onyame or Legba. The God of the black Christians is what a god should
be—a mere form for spiritual content, the container of the divine. The
actual spiritual content, the divine essence, must be supplied by the
believer himself.

On the other hand, the Negro gave to the Christian faith meanings and
values that are missing in the religion of the white man. One is the
fear of death. A Christian should

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

not fear life's end. To him it is only a crossing from the foyer into
the parlor. Death is the embrace of God, and who would disdain a divine
embrace? But the black man is afraid of death. So is every primitive
man. Death is the greatest mystery, more incomprehensible than the
dreadful ghosts in the dark of the bush. The black man was full of fear
in the wilds of Africa. He is still afraid on the plantations of the
South. Most of his religious outcries, as expressed in his spirituals,
deal with death and his fear of it. He conceives it as the crossing of a
river, the descent into inferior regions, or flight through the
clouds—always, however, in fear and troubled spirit.

And the black man wants to die easy when he dies. True, the Christian in
him comes to the fore. He wants to see Jesus near him, but he also wants
to see his mother. In other words, he wishes to be among his own people
when that terrible moment comes. Even when he refers to the "comin' of
the Savior," he speaks in terms of farewell.

I’m-a goin’ to tell you ’bout de comin’ of de Saviour,  
Fare you well, fare you well.  
Dere’s a better day a-comin’,  
Fare you well, fare you well;  
Oh, preacher, fol’ yo’ bible,  
Fare you well, fare you well.  
In dat great gittin’ up mornin’,  
Fare you well, fare you well.

To the black man, death is like another descent to the dark hold of the
slave ship, but all the more horrible because of the fires of hell. The
Lord said, "He's gwinter rain down fire, dere's no hidin’ place down
dere." The negro is even afraid of little Mary. "Oh, touch me not,
little Mary, good Lord, I'm gwine home." He is ever worried about

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

where he may be "when de first trumpet soun’." He is forever asking his
fellow men what they are "gwine to do when yo’ lamp burn down." He is
hidden in the shadow of the rocks and mountains that are forever falling
upon him. In short, if Jesus does not help him, he "sho’ly will die."
And not much can be done for his troubled mind. He is conscious of his
Christian inadequacy. He "done done" what God told him to do. God told
him to pray, and he "done pray." God told him to sing, and he
"done done" that, too. Yet the result is far from satisfactory. Neither
he nor the church has gotten out of it what they could.

Try my bes’ for to serve my Master,  
Try my bes’ for to follow my Leader,  
Try my bes’ for to kneel an’ pray so the devil won't harm me.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But no matter what
he does, the church keeps on grumbling; and although he is "gwine cling
to de ship o’ Zion," the black man cannot be so happy about it. For he,
too, has reason to be "a-grumblin’," and he would have been doing so had
he dared. His faith leaves him cold, as he leaves the church. For here
is another value that the Negro Christian greatly emphasized, if he did
not actually introduce it into the worship of the church—the sentimental
longing.

Spending the evenings in the cabin on the plantation, the heart of the
black man was eaten away by longing. It was the vague, indefinite
feeling that often comes over the adolescent youth, making him wish to
cry out of the fullness of his heart, although he hardly knows why. In
the case of the Negro, there was not one but a whole series of longings
that consciously or subconsciously made his heart heavy. There was his
yearning for the land

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

of his fathers of which little was actually remembered but much was
related. Seeking to console himself in his present plight, he gloried in
the past. In his imagination, he reconstructed the grandeur of Africa as
he sought to escape from the humiliations into which he had been thrown
in America. What the coming of the Messiah was to the Jew and the
kingdom of heaven to the Christian, the land of Africa was to the black
man picking cotton in the South.

There was the longing for the tribal gods not completely forgotten yet
not consciously retained; the longing for a god that was of the church
yet not of it; a god that combined in his being both Jehovah and Onyame,
Mary and Legba, Voodooism and Christianity. There was also the longing
for the mate, the pang of love unsatisfied, love that once was free and
full and that, combined with religion, brought the greatest joy of
exaltation and ecstasy. Here he was wifeless, at the mercy of the
master, who picked a woman for him without any consideration as to his
liking. With her he was to live in strict adherence to the rules that
white people had evolved—laws that the master himself honored more in
their breach than in their observance.

These channels of longing merged in one great stream that assumed a
religious form. Longing for God or Jesus or some vague heavenly state is
the only outlet for the great stirrings within the heart of the black
man. Sometimes he sings, "I feel like a motherless child, a long ways
from home, true believer, a long ways from home." Then he recalls his
religion and adds: "Sometimes I feel like I’m almos’ gone, way up in the
heab’nly lan’." The two are really one. He is no more elated over the
"heab’nly lan’" than he is over being a long way from home. He is not

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

only far from home, but friendless and lonely: "Nobody knows the trouble
I've seen, nobody knows but Jesus, nobody but Jesus." And Jesus does not
seem to do anything about it. Nor does he feel that he can appeal to
Jesus for help. For, after all, Jesus is also a stranger. At best, he is
the keeper of the heavenly door and he does not worry himself over the
sinner that may arrive a bit too late:

"Too late, too late, Sinnah,  
 Carry de key an’ gone home.  
 Massa Jesus lock de do’,  
 O, Lord! too late,  
 Massa Jesus lock de do’."

When the black man makes his appeal, he turns to the Lord himself. His
cry is for deliverance, for removal from this environment. But this very
same appeal carries within it the element of love. The antithesis of
life here below, on foreign land, is not only "heab’n," but "heab’nly
love" as well. The soul of the Negro is pining away, and he calls to
God:

"My good Lord, show me de way;  
 Enter the chariot, travel along.  
 Noah sent out a mournin’ dove,  
 Which brought back a token of a heab’nly love."

#### IV

The black man of Africa may have accepted an entirely spiritual God but
he could not live up to an entirely spiritual religion. Not for him was
the dream of Nirvana, of peaceful contemplation and of passive union
with the Divine Being. His faith was to be not only spiritual and
emotional, but motor as well. He was to serve his God

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

not only with his heart and soul, but also, and primarily, with his
muscles. In religious exercises, the Negro's muscles are so strained and
contracted that one may almost hear the rattling of his bones. There is
rhythmic movement in his feet upon the floor of the church. He waves his
hands and outstretches his arms, tossing about his head and rolling his
eyes. The services are continually interrupted by groans and shouts, or
an occasional "falling out" as some member faints away when the Holy
Ghost descends upon him.

Entire congregations join in dances that are not much different from
those of the Indians or the Africans about their fires in forest or
bush. One such dance is practiced by the members of the Zion Baptist
Church in Florida. It is executed at the close of the communion service
in the immediate center of the church. The leader stands in front of the
pulpit and motions to the worshippers. They rise and form a circle about
him and the pulpit, marching around in single file. Falling into regular
step, the tempo of which is quickened, the dancers gesticulate and
shout: "Rock, Daniel, rock, Daniel, rock, Daniel, rock, Daniel, till I
die." They dance, not until they die, but until they fall into a swoon
of rapture and ecstasy.

In Alabama, the faithful find even greater exaltation in the Roper
dance. Here, too, they march about a central figure that claps his hands
and shouts vociferously until he falls into a trance of ecstasy. This is
a signal for the entire congregation to join in embraces between the
opposite sexes, with all the force of maddened passion. The dance is
commenced at the close of the services and continues indefinitely.
Couple after couple gradually break away, some going into the dark
corners of the church,

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

others to the corridors, there to give themselves to one another in the
frenzy of sexual and religious passion. For once, Legba of the West
Coast of Africa has triumphed over Mary and her Son in Alabama of
America.

Many dances are engaged in by the entire congregation at every service.
Others are executed only on certain festive occasions. But the motor
element in religion is ever to the front in the Negro's worship, and
still the soul of the black man is ever yearning for greater freedom and
larger outlets. The groan and the shout and the dance are only the minor
outpourings, like the thin vapors coming forth from the crater of the
volcano. They are but slightly indicative of the enormous forces
operating within. The eruption of the religious Vesuvius takes place in
the camp meeting or revival. The revival is the elixir of black
Christianity, coming periodically to wash away the dust from Negro souls
and to bring re-birth in faith.

The great masses of black men entered the faith of the cross by way of
the revivals and camp meetings held by several Protestant denominations
a little over a century ago. There, Christ was crucified anew for
thousands of black listeners so that they might attach their souls to
his bleeding limbs. There, hell with its blazing fires and devilish
tortures was vividly pictured. There, black souls found the glory of
conversion and of communion with God—the merging of one's soul in love
with the All-soul of the universe. And ever since, the revival has been
the dream of the black devout, his oasis in the desert of the white
man's faith.

Theodore Schroeder, with the great psychological insight that is so
characteristic of his studies in religion, offers us a complete
description of a Negro revival meeting. The

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

service opened at eight in the evening and lasted until midnight. The
pastor began with some humorous remarks about common-place things,
bringing his audience to laughter and thereby establishing a personal
contact. He was no longer for them a man of God, cold and distant, but a
neighbor, a friend and good fellow. Then, turning to religious topics,
he elaborated upon the evils of sin and the tortures of hell. And as he
did so, the laughter of the audience changed to groans, sighs, and
humming, accompanied by rhythmic tapping of the feet, movements of the
heads and clapping of the hands. The pastor himself was growing ever
more excited. He jumped and shouted, threatened and exhorted. Here, he
was rising to the angels; there, he was sinking into the fires of hell.
Suddenly, he lapsed into a sing-song, monotonous intonation, his words
hardly audible, certainly unintelligible. He seemed to be in tune with
his worshippers. His fire was gone, his spasmodic exclamations
diminished. He felt the approach of a kindly spirit, drawing ever closer
and closer in perfect embrace.

It was just at this moment that the greatest excitation occurred among
the worshippers. Wild shrieks broke in upon the rambling intonations of
the pastor. Many jumped high from the floor; some leaped upon chairs and
wildly waved their arms through the air. Others sat on the laps of their
neighbors in rapturous phantasy. Pandemonium reigned. The Holy Ghost was
busy.

While the pastor carried on in his silent, trembling way, others sought
to take care of those who were "possessed of the Holy Ghost." One male
attendant grabbed the arms of a young woman, who twisted back and forth
convulsively. He pulled her arms straight. She yielded to his greater
strength and dropped her head upon his chest,

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

resting quietly in his embrace. Another young man came and sought to
open her clenched fist, but he was unable to do so. The two joined in an
attempt to seat her, but her body refused to bend. She was carried from
the room as rigid as a board.

There was another young woman, who began to gesticulate, slowly at first
and then violently. Her movements were accompanied by song that turned
into convulsive shrieks. Losing all control of her bodily muscles, she
staggered about, extending her arms as if she were trying to embrace
someone. Then she collapsed entirely. And as she did, a mulatto girl
suddenly shrieked and jumped into a place in front of her, as if driven
by an overwhelming explosion. Her body was twisting, every muscle in
violent motion. Her breathing was spasmodic, loud, uncertain. In the
ecstasy of religion, she, too, was ready to collapse when caught by two
men, who supported her writhing body. And as they held her, her pelvis
moved most vigorously backward and forward. Women came to assist the men
in sustaining her sinking body. All the while, she twisted and wriggled
as if to compel a release of the men's hold upon her arms. Gradually her
body stiffened and grew rigid. Then she seemed to relax; the Holy Spirit
was leaving her.

In all these cases, the intense emotion of the religious enthusiast is
inseparably associated with the emotional outbursts that accompany a
love experience. The black man, longing for love and companionship,
found an outlet for his desires in the religion of the camp meeting.
There, piety and love mingled in the flame of passion. And the negro
opened his heart as he had done when he was happy and care-free in the
African bush.

Great was the relief that the religious awakenings brought to the soul
of the black man, but long were the intervals between. By its very
nature, the revival is temporary, an occasional affair, a mere flash of
light in a long, black night. Once it was over the Negro again found
himself alone in the desert of his religion. And to get away from this
isolation, he addressed himself to the strange faith of the white man in
an attempt to make it his own. This endeavor resulted in Voodoo, a
hasty, crude synthesis of African paganism and European Christianity.
Here was the true communion of a black soul with a white God.

The Lord of the whites was a jealous God. He would have no other gods
before Him. But the magic wand of Voodoo easily wiped away this divine
jealousy. Both gods and God are being worshipped in Voodoo in perfect
harmony. In fact, the black man appeals to the kind Virgin to intercede
for him with his African gods of terror. These gods demand human
sacrifices from him, and the Son of the Virgin forbids the taking of
human life. Will not his Holy Mother take the matter up with the gods so
that they may be satisfied with animal sacrifices instead?

The Virgin Mother must share her throne with Legba, the guardian of the
gates, equally benevolent to all in need of solace and particularly
close to the heart of the black people. The Holy Ghost has an additional
function in the religion of Voodoo. His duty it is to pick up the soul
of the black man and carry it back to Africa, where the sun rises, the
ultimate abode of all and the place of true life. While the soul is thus
carried away by the Holy Ghost, its owner falls into a state of ecstasy.
And so, wherever a

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

black man may be, once he is in a trance, his soul goes back to Africa,
the land for which he ever yearns. The God of the Christians must not
disdain to have as his associate Legba the male, the black Priapus. He
will find still other gods sharing the black man's worship with Him.
Among these is Papa Nebo, who is both male and female, usually
represented by a tall woman, wearing the skirt of her sex

The Virgin shares her altar with Legba  

and the coat and silk hat of a man. He symbolizes the union of both
sexes in one individual.

Both God and gods are worshipped on the same altar with the same
offerings of flowers and cakes, corn and animal meat. And amidst the
sacred offerings, there are always objects dear to other gods in other
climes. Serpents in wood and metal are there to represent the great god,
Damballa. The sacred bull, too, holds a place of honor

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

before the altar, while all about the place are figures of triangles and
columns, so common in the temples dedicated to the generative
divinities. Along with the pagan symbols there are always found a
crucifix, a black statue of the Virgin, and a cross often painted like a
totem pole.

Various are the forms of Voodoo ceremony. They differ according to the
locality and the mode of living among the worshippers. In backward,
agricultural countries, a goat may be sacrificed to take the place of a
man-offering, just as the lamb was substituted for Isaac in Abraham's
sacrifice. The blood streaming from the goat symbolizes the mystery of
death and the purification of the soul. Poured upon the earth, it is
believed to bring the blessing of fertilization. In such animal
sacrifices, an egg is often used to represent rebirth. It is broken by
the priestess who prays: "Legba, Papa Legba, open wide the gates for
this, my little one!"

Again, Voodoo may be limited to the practice of magic and the use of
charms and talismans. This is especially true in certain parts of the
West Indies. W. B. Seabrook, in The Magic Island, describes a Voodoo
love charm: "Two needles of equal length are stood upright, side by
side, baptized with suitable incantations, and are given the names of
the youth and his unwilling girl. . . . The needles are then left side
by side, parallel but reversed, so that the point of each presses
against the eye of the other. The point is symbolic of the phallus and
the eye symbolic of the vulva. The reverse doubling simply increases the
potency of the charm. . . ."

Crude and incongruous does Voodoo seem to us today. We have little
respect and much less sympathy for it. Yet its ceremonies are merely the
infantile steps of the black man in the House of the Lord. The white man
has had

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

his Voodoo. When the European heathen was suddenly thrown into the House
of the Lord, he, too, could not entirely forget his own gods and modes
of worship. Then, too, a synthesis was attempted, an adjustment and
compromise between the rival faiths. And this synthesis was no less
crude, possibly, in the early centuries of Christianity

than Voodoo is today. It took many centuries to smelt down the various
components into a harmonious unit. It required a still longer time to
refine the product of this synthetic process. The fathers of the church
complained of strange practices in the church of the early centuries,
much as men of religion complain of Voodoo today.

Were Voodoo left alone, it might in time develop into a

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

new faith upon a Christian foundation. It might become a great and
worthy addition to man's cultural heritage. However, this esthetic
evolution may hardly be expected. Voodoo will be given neither time nor
opportunity to grow and develop and refine itself as it climbs the steps
of progress. When white Voodoo was in existence, it was not at all out
of tune with its time. In fact, it was the new Hebraic faith that was
novel and out of keeping with the

Images of the Voodoo gods  

social customs of the day. Nor did white Voodoo have an older brother to
teach it right thinking and proper manners. Beyond it, except for the
faith of the Jews in a faraway land, there was sheer paganism.

Today, in civilized countries, Voodoo is nothing more than black magic
bordering on charlatanism and generally severely forbidden by law. There
is a mother church that keeps a watchful eye over the religious
development of the black man, and it will not allow him to wander off,
spiritually, into the bush. Voodoo is destined to be up-

rooted. The black man will have to cling to his white God in the white
way. Yet, there is something exotic about this struggle of the black
soul in the House of the Lord. It is the flutter of love, warm and wild
from the bush, against the cold, hard wall of self-denial.
