### CHAPTER IV

### THE REVOLT AGAINST GOD

#### I

KORAH rose up against Moses and Diakonus Nikolaus against Paul. There
were others who dared to rise, not only against the men of God, but
against the Divine Being Himself. They allied themselves with Satan, for
all their faith in God. And this alliance may not be so strange as it
appears.

The belief in devils was well-nigh universal. Jesus drove seven demons
out of Mary Magdalene alone. These devils may have signified the
earthliness of Mary, her sexuality dragging her down into the abyss of
prostitution. In fact, the devil was conceived as imitating God, aping
Him as it were. He was paying homage to idols with the same sacraments
as the faithful were using in their divine worship. Moreover, the evil
spirit is ever spiting the Divine Being. The latter seeks to keep man
good and pure; the former is ever leading him into temptation, always on
the lookout to drag him down into the mire of sin. And just as purity
consists principally in chastity, so does the demon, in direct
opposition, concentrate on fornication as his means of leading souls
astray.

The evil spirit may assume any human form, male or female and, as such,
cohabit with humans. In fact, it was believed by such men as Augustine
that the devil could

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

impregnate a woman. To do this, he must first assume the form of a woman
and cohabit with a man. After receiving within him the semen of the
male, he would change himself into the form of a man and cohabit with a
woman, transferring to her the semen he had previously received. There
actually were women, in the Middle Ages, who claimed to have been
visited at night by the devil and who related how they had felt his
semen to be cold.

The evil spirit was elevated to a position almost on a plane with that
of the Divinity by Manes, a Persian, who drew about himself a
considerable following in the third century. He was an uncompromising
dualist, who saw the world as the manifestation of two forces: light and
darkness, day and night, God and the devil. Just as God is supreme in
the world of light, so is the devil the lord in the world of darkness.
Both are great, omnipotent, and spiritual, almost on a par with each
other, but standing in opposition from all eternity, touching, yet
remaining un-mingled.

The first man, Adam, was really, according to Manes, the product of the
devil. It was Satan who created him in his own image, in conjunction
with sin and desire. Satan, too, gave him Eve as his companion and
seducer. He drove into Adam all portions of light he had stolen from the
kingdom above, and, as a result, Adam was a discordant being, created in
the image of the evil spirit, yet carrying within him the spark of
light. Even Eve was possessed of a tiny spark or ember. And, although
the first humans were entirely under the dominion of the devil, they
were at the same time under the protection of another agent. The
glorious spirits in the world of light above took these two humans under
their care and sent

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

down æons, spiritual beings, to instruct them in light and to guard them
against sensuality.

Now, man possesses infinitely more light in him than does woman. The
latter conveys the idea of darkness. In fact, the entire Kingdom of
Darkness is often referred to as feminine. Eve is the embodiment of
sensuous seduction. She led man astray by awakening within him the
sexual passion. But other sensuous pleasures are the work of the devil.
Sexual desire is the original sin, because through sex the light
substance imprisoned within the body is extended for a longer period of
time. Woman is, then, a demonic evil. Sensuality is the means the devil
uses to bind man to the inferior regions. Consequently, Manes had three
seals by which he sought to hold man as closely as possible to the
glorious spirits in the upper world of light. They were: *signaculum
oris*, the taboo on meat and wine, *signaculum manes*, the taboo on
labor, and *signaculum sinus*, the taboo on sex. But of the three, the
last one was by far the most important. Marriage was anathema, and
intercourse or any relationship whatever with a woman was a union with
the devil.

Thus, the faith of Manes and of his disciples was preoccupied with
theologic problems concerning the powers in both the upper and the lower
spiritual worlds. In so far as it was concerned with sex, the sect had
not a good word for it, looking upon it as a mere activity of the devil.
And yet, there was one little turn given these very theologic concepts
that made of this sect a community concerned primarily with sex and
engaged in setting free their sexual urges.

Since the body and its passions belong to an entirely different world
from that of the spirit or light spark

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

dwelling in man, the less contact there is between the two, the better
it will be for the soul, the purer it may hope to remain. The more the
body is degraded, the deeper it wallows in the mire, the further it
sinks into the abyss of darkness, the stronger and purer is the light of
the spirit within it. Consequently, indulgence in sex is a

way of purifying the soul by soiling the body. In this respect, their
theory may have been evinced by their own actual experiences. For when
one's mind is obsessed with sex, and his desires are forever egging him
on in the sexual path—desires that are not being satisfied—his mind is
bound to be blurred, and he is unable to think calmly and clearly. But
when the strain of continency is raised, the

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

resulting mental serenity is conducive to clear thinking and to
spiritual activity. Hence, while marriage was forbidden, prostitution
was raised to a sacred institution. Many of the followers of Manes threw
aside all bonds and settled on the shores of the Jordan, establishing
there a community in which absolute sexual promiscuity prevailed.

#### II

In the Middle Ages, the sects growing out of the Manichæans, the Cathars
and the Bulgarites, were persecuted for the practice of homosexuality,
which they were accused of spreading in their communities. Because they
maintained that the devil had exerted a powerful influence in the
teachings of Christianity, the Cathars were accused of worshipping the
evil spirit.

Still another Satanic sect, the Messalians, which persisted until the
eleventh century, even cursed the Son of Man at their mysteries,
although they believed in his divine nature and in his mission as the
savior of the world. In their orgiastic rites, they introduced "devils"
with which they engaged in sadistic and masochistic acts.

The rebellion against God was still further evinced in the witchcraft
cult that reached the climax of its development in the latter part of
the fifteenth century. The members of this sect looked upon the devil as
their father, and they joined together in weekly meetings, sabbats, to
render him homage. There, the devil appeared under various forms. At
times he would enter the body of a tom-cat or a goat. Again he would
assume the appearance of a bull or a very strong black man. But whatever
his form, virility was ever his outstanding characteristic.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

As the worship progressed, the faithful, free from all restraint,
satisfied their hunger and thirst with food and drink. Intoxicated with
drink and excitement, they extinguished the lights, while the devil
commanded: "Mix, mix." Then it was that all bonds were thrown aside, and
men and women, mad with the heat and flames of passion, indulged in
promiscuous sexual union. And as the women far outnumbered the men in
this cult, many of them sought intercourse with the devil, under
whatever form he may have assumed. There is on record in Toulouse the
case of one such woman, who confessed that she had engaged in
intercourse with the devil and had given birth to a monster, half wolf
and half serpent.
