### PROLOGUE

### IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

BETWEEN the Temple of the Gods and the House of the Lord lay a great
stretch of thought and sentiment. In the Temple, man came to live this
life for all that it had to offer him in sensuous pleasure and delight.
To live was the only purpose of being. Beyond life, if there was
anything, it was a shadowy existence, nothing to look forward to. Man
came into the Temple of the Gods like the drunkard into the hostelry; he
drained his cup to the very bottom and relished every drop of it.

In the House of the Lord, man came not to live, but to prepare for
death. Death was not the end of life, but its true beginning. Beyond it
lay the great hereafter, unspoiled by suffering and remorse, unlimited
by time, unbounded in its divine pleasure and heavenly bliss. In
comparison with the eternal happiness, this life was but a passing
moment of misery. All one could do in this brief span of years was to
prepare as well as possible for the great life to come.

Far apart as the Temple and the House stood, they still had some common
ground between them. Preceding the House of the Lord in time and
surpassing it in extent, the Temple left it an inheritance of which it
has as yet been unable to dispose. This is the attitude toward woman and
sex.

In the Temple of the Gods, there was no quarrel with

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

the sexual function of man just as there was no quarrel there with any
other phase of human nature. There was no idea of restraint in matters
of sex. Venus bathed in the foam of the waves; man was to bathe in the
sea of Venus. Sex was brought to the very altar of the gods as the
greatest offering man could make, as the object closest to his heart.
This pagan, positive attitude toward the sexual life, the House did not
accept.

However, there were other tendencies toward sex and woman in the Temple.
They were decadent, negative, introvertive, wavering between orgy and
denial. When the drunkard has had too much to drink, he suffers a
headache. He has a disagreeable taste in his mouth and his whole body is
enervated. He despises the very liquor he so greatly cherished before.
He loves the drink and he hates it; while the person who drinks in
moderation has a more wholesome and normal attitude toward it. Like the
drunkard, they who raised sex to its place upon the altar of the gods
also dragged it down into the gutter. They who sanctified it with
libations also defiled it with muck. Sex was not only the most beautiful
flower but also the most despicable weed. It was god itself, yet it was
anathema.

A similar condition obtained in the attitude toward the carrier of
sex—woman. Peoples who never placed woman upon a pedestal never thought
her quite so unclean. They who saw her as a goddess could not see her
again as a human being. Woman was a goddess because of sex; she was a
demon for the same reason. One's estimate of woman depended upon his
view of sex, for the two concepts were inseparable. Man's view of sex
was bound to come down from its divine plane. The world was becoming

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

secularized, commercialized, and, with it, love became a commodity one
bought at a price in the market. Along with sex, woman also came down
into the scum of the market-place. Like sex, woman as a person, an
individual, was degraded and placed below human values. The daughters of
man suffered greatest humiliations at the hands of their former most
ardent admirers, the worshippers in the Temple of the Gods.

This negative attitude toward sex and woman not only found its way into
the House of the Lord but once there it was bound to grow and to expand.
It corresponded perfectly with the general negative view of life held by
the believers in the Lord. Struggling against this life for the one to
come, the keepers of the faith saw in love their arch-enemy, Satan or
the Anti-Christ. For love is an intrenchment of the physical, of
earthliness. However it begins, it inevitably ends in carnal pleasure.
It drags man down to the animal plane; it does not permit him to rise to
the heights of the divine. In fact, love's very inception was in sin and
its first experience led to the fall of man.

It was the serpent, the tempter, that first manifested love to God's
children. Eve stooped to listen to words of love; then she disobeyed. In
her disobedience lay the ruination of all mankind. Forsaking the word of
God for the taste of an apple, Eve gave up spiritual values for material
gains and sold her soul to please her body. Succumbing to the attentions
of the serpent, she broke the laws of God and man for a brief moment of
carnal passion. The serpent, symbolizing sexual love, was, then, the
source of all evil in the world and the cause of man's downfall

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

And so it behooves man, today and every day until the trumpet sounds the
call to judgment, to cleanse his soul of the original sin. He is to
resist all temptations of the flesh and, above all, the call of sex. In
sexual union man fell, and every union draws both individual and
humanity downward, causing them to sink into the abyss of sin and
perdition. The very suggestion of sex must therefore be fought as
desperately as the greatest temptation set by the devil. Consequently,
man must be on his guard against woman. Like the serpent, she is the
great tempter. It is she who disturbs man's thinking and turns his heart
away from God. It is she who fires his veins with passion and calls him
to a life that offers physical joys but brings in return eternities of
punishment. Her very existence is a reminder of the flesh, of the
physical, of carnal desires. Woman has drawn man down; she will not let
him rise again.

And yet, weak was the flesh and ill the heart of man from his very
youth. Everyone had a bit of love in his life. It could no more be
entirely shut out than could the sunshine. Even in the House of the
Lord, the young man's fancy turned to thoughts of love; and the heart of
the maiden beat faster and stronger when her eyes fell upon the youth of
her dreams. As the youth was drawn to the maiden, love gained the upper
hand; it asserted itself above and despite all interdicts. Love broke
out in the very House of the Lord.

And so, the keepers of the faith, whether Jew or Christian or Moslem,
had to suffer the young people to do love's bidding and to allow man his
way in sex. Love was permitted under conditions. It was considerably
limited and circumscribed. It was first to be sanctioned

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

by the Lord and blessed by the priest. It was not to be entered into for
carnal pleasure, but it was to be consecrated to a pious end, to further
the heavenly purpose of keeping the world populated. Not for his own
weary, lonesome, longing soul was man to cross the threshold of love,
but for the fulfillment of the word of the Lord. "Be fruitful and
multiply."

And thus it was that, having banished love . through the door, the
keepers of the faith had to call it back through the window. However
justified and accounted for, once love entered the House of the Lord it
overfilled the sacred dwelling. The very walls are set upon a foundation
of love, and Cupid's arrows are all over the place. There is the tremor
of love in every voice calling to God. There is the sigh of love in
every cry of the weary soul for peace and salvation. Love was crucified
by the keepers of the faith, but it returned all the more glorious, with
a crown of beauty upon its head.
