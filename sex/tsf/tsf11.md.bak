#### I

MOLOCH was the mighty, gluttonous god. He bestowed his bounty upon
mankind, but he wished a taste of all that he gave. Moloch gave only to
be gifted in return. There was no altruistic hypocrisy in his little
divine circle. He was not saving the world; he was not serving mankind.
He cared for neither the praise nor the glory that others might give
him.

Moloch was a fierce, self-satisfied, masculine god. He defied the weaker
sex even in love. He had no women himself, nor did he wish his
worshippers coming to his temple to trail their women along. He wanted
none of their weakness, gentleness, delicacy, or romanticism. He was the
god of muscle and belly. If cannibals were looking for a god, none could
please them so much as Moloch, and Moloch could wish himself no better
class of worshipper.

His temple was out in the open, far from city or village with their
polished ways of living. It was an immense, low structure with an
enormous figure of Moloch at its end. Like the modern industrial plant
with its towering chimney rising to the clouds,. the god himself
appeared

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

before his worshippers—a colossal giant of a man with a bull's head and
tremendous virile power. His arms he held outstretched as if he were
forever demanding sacrifices. There were seven huge mouths to his belly,
all appropriate receptacles for the offerings that might be brought to
him.

The figure of Moloch was cast in bronze and merged with a large furnace
that served as its pedestal. Whatever was fed to the god immediately
landed in the fiery oven. Moloch the glutton would take no chances with
his priests who might put away a sacrifice for themselves or share with
him the fat of the land.

As the sun was setting, the worshippers left their homes and wives, and,
loaded with sacrifices, they betook themselves to the warm abode of
their god. While they were on their way, a huge fire was being prepared
in the pit of the furnace, and as they entered the temple, flames
reflected through the bronze figure of the divinity. Cold, cruel, and
metallic Moloch had become incandescent, aflame with the fire of life.
Moloch was the fire that does burn the bush and everything else; he was
the fire that devours.

As the tongues of flame shot through the monstrous figure, the
worshippers yelled for joy. They danced about it, emitting terrific
cries and, in frenzy, hurled whatever they had into the mouths of the
fiery god. There may have been products of the soil, fruits of the farm,
a calf or a sheep, even a cat or a dog. One may have thrown his own
cloak into the gaping mouth when he had nothing else to give.

When the signal was given, the eunuch priests of Moloch marched into the
temple and about the radiant figure. They came to serve this cruel,
relentless god, as the priestesses paid homage to a goddess more loving
and generous.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> While the fair sex
was excluded, sexual passion persisted and seemed all the more fired
because of the absence of women; and beautiful, beardless young men,
their bodies soft and fragrant from the use of oils and perfumes, sold
themselves to the adorers of their god, depositing on the altar of the
idol the money thus earned. Within the temple, too, there were dogs
trained for the same purpose and the coins received from the rental or
sale of these animals, called the "price of a dog," went to the priests
of Moloch.

The eunuch priests constituted a caste or sect with their own rites of
initiation. These were held at night in the depths of the forest. There,
in the heat of frenzy and stirred by wild music, they gashed their own
bodies and ran about with blood streaming from their wounds, falling
over each other as they did so.

#### II

Women were excluded from this sheer masculine world of Moloch and his
tribe. But the wives of the Molochites clamored for a god and for
Moloch. The husbands would have none of it, but the high priest of
Moloch knew better. He saw additional revenue for the temple with a sect
of women doing for themselves what the men had been doing alone.

Thus women, too, came to serve Moloch. They had their priestesses, who
prostituted themselves to the women worshippers as the eunuch priests
did to the males. The priestesses dwelled in gay colored tents about the
temple of Moloch, burning incense, playing soothing music, and preparing
love charms and potions.

Both men and women danced about the blazing Moloch,

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

two human races with no direct emotional contact, yet not without some
influence upon each other. For the frenzied desire of the women for
their priestesses reflexively aroused the passions of the men for the
objects of their love.

When the women came to offer their sacrifices, they cast into the
devouring belly of Moloch whatever there was upon them or within their
arms. The greater the sacrifice, the more exaltation the devotee
derived. In the heat of her ever-increasing passion, she brought the
greatest sacrifice a mother could offer. It was then that Moloch first
tasted the flesh and blood of the infants thrown within him by mothers
gone mad with desire.

Moloch was the contrary god. he was contrary to all the refinements that
human society had developed in its march of civilization. He was
contrary to human nature in love and sex. In Moloch, man revolted
against his better self. In Moloch, he turned his face on his own
humanity. He quickly ran down the ladder up which he had struggled so
hard to ascend.
