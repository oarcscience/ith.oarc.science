# XLI.

Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav:--The Divine name, which consists of
forty-two letters, is revealed only to him who is prudent and meek, who
has reached the meridian of life, is not prone to wrath, not given to
drink, and not revengeful. He that knows that name, and acts
circumspectly in regard to it, and retains it sacredly, is beloved in
heaven and esteemed on earth; He inspires men with reverence, and is
heir both to the world that now is and that which is to come.

Kiddushin, fol. 71, col. 1.

A man should always devote himself to the study of the law and to the
practice of good deeds, even if he does not do so for their own sake, as
self-satisfied performance may follow in due course. Thus, in recompense
for the forty-two sacrifices he offered, Balak was accounted worthy to
become the ancestor of Ruth. Rav Yossi bar Hunna has said, Ruth was the
daughter of Eglon, the grandson of Balak, king of Moab.

Sanhedrin, fol. 105, col. 2.
