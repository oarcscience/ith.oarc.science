# Six Thousand.

The world is to last six thousand years. Two thousand of these are
termed the period of disorder, two thousand be long to the dispensation
of the law, and two thousand are the days of the Messiah; but because of
our iniquities a large fraction of the latter term is already passed and
gone without the Messiah giving any sign of His appearing.

Sanhedrin, fol. 97, col. 1.
