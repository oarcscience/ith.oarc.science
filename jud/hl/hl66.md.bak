# CCXX.

The cup of David in the world to come will contain two hundred and
twenty-one logs; as it is said (Ps. xxiii. 5), "My cup runneth over,"
the numerical value of the Hebrew word, "runneth over," being two
hundred and twenty-one.

Yoma, fol. 76, col. 1.

In the world to come the Holy One will make a grand banquet for the
righteous from the flesh of the leviathan. *Bava Bathra*, fol. 75, col.
1. (See the Morning Service for the middle days of the Feast of
Tabernacles.) God will make a banquet for the righteous on the day when
He shows His mercy to the posterity of Isaac. After the meal the cup of
blessing will be handed to Abraham, in order that he may pronounce the
blessing, but he will plead excuse because he begat Ishmael. Then Isaac
will be told to take the cup and speak

{p. 184}

the benediction of grace, but he also will plead his unworthiness
because he begat Esau. Next Jacob also will refuse because he married
two sisters. Then Moses, on the ground that he was unworthy to enter the
land of promise, or even to be buried in it; and finally Joshua will
plead unworthiness because he had no son. David will then be called upon
to take the cup and bless, and he will respond, "Yea, I will bless, for
I am worthy to bless, as it is said (Ps. cxvi. 13), 'I will take the cup
of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.'" P'sachim, fol. 119,
col. 2. This cup, as we are told above, will contain two hundred and
twenty-one logs (which the Rabbis tell us, is the twenty-fourth part of
a seah, therefore this cup will hold rather more than one-third of a
hogshead of wine).
