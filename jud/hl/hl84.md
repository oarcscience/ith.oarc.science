# Eight Thousand.

Tradition records that the ladder (mentioned Gen. xxviii. 12) was eight
thousand miles wide, for it is written, "And behold the angels of God
ascending and descending upon it." Angels ascending, being in the
plural, cannot be fewer than two at a time, and so likewise must those
descending, so that when they passed they were four abreast at least. In
Daniel x. 6 it is said of the angel,

{p. 219}

"His body was like Tarshish," and there is a story that Tarshish
extended two thousand miles.

Chullin, fol. 91, col. 2.
