# XXXII.

When Rav Deimi arrived at Babylon, he reported that the Romans had
fought thirty-two battles with the Greeks without once conquering them,
until they allied themselves with Israel, on the stipulation that where
Rome appointed the commanding officers the Jews should appoint the
governors, and *vice versâ*.

Avodah Zarah, fol. 8, col. 2.
