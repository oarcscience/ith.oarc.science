# Seven Thousand.

As the land of Canaan had one year of release in seven, so has the world
one millennium of release in seven thousand years; for it is said (Isa.
ii. 17), "And the Lord alone will be exalted in that day;" and again
(Ps. xcii. 1), "A psalm or song for the Sabbath day," which means a long
Sabbatic period, and again (Ps. xc. 4), "For a thousand years in Thy
sight are but as the day of yesterday."

Ibid.
