# Twenty Thousand.

Now we know what God does during the day, but how does He occupy Himself
in the night-time? We may say He does the same as at day-time; or that
during the night He rides on a swift cherub over eighteen thousand
worlds; as it is said (Ps. lxviii. 17), "The chariots of God are twenty
thousand," less two thousand Shinan; read not Shinan but She-einan, *i.
e.*, two thousand less than twenty thousand, therefore eighteen
thousand.

Avodah Zarah, fol. 3. col. 2.

Prince Contrukos asked Rabbon Yochanan ben Zacchai how, when the
detailed enumeration of the Levites amounted to twenty-two thousand
three hundred (the Gershonites, 7500; the Kohathites, 8600; the
Merarites, 6200, making in all 22,300), the sum total given is only
twenty-two

{p. 222}

thousand, omitting the three hundred. "Was Moses, your Rabbi," he asked,
"a cheat or a bad calculator?" He answered, "They were first-borns, and
therefore could not be substitutes for the first-born of Israel."

Bechoroth, fol. 5, col. 1.
