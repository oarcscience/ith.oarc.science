# XLVIII.

Rabbi Meir had a disciple named Sumchus, who in every case assigned
forty-eight reasons why one thing should be called clean and why another
should be called unclean, though Scripture declared the contrary. (A
striking illustration of Rabbinical ingenuity! )

Eiruvin, fol. 13, col. 2.

Forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses prophesied unto Israel, and
they have neither diminished nor added to that which is written in the
law, except the reading of the Book of Esther.

Meggillah, fol. 14, col. 1.

The Rabbis teach that in future (in the days of the Messiah) all
Scripture will be abolished except the Book of Esther, also all
festivals except the feast of Purim. (See *Menorath Hamaor*, fol. 135,
col. 1.)

By forty-eight things the law is acquired. These are study, attention,
careful conversation, mental discernment, solicitude, reverential fear,
meekness, geniality of soul, purity, attention to the wise, mutual
discussion, debating, sedateness, learning in the Scripture and the
Mishna, not dabbling in commerce, self-denial, moderation in sleep,
aversion to gossip, etc., etc.

Avoth, chap. 6.
