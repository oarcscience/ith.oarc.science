# Thirty Thousand.

"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death" (2 Chron.
xxxii. 33). This is Hezekiah, king of Judah, at whose funeral thirty-six
thousand people attended bare-shouldered, . . . and upon his bier was
laid a roll of the law, and it was said, "This man has fulfilled what is
written in this book."

Bava Kama, fol. 17, col. 1.
