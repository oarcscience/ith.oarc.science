# Five Thousand.

The Pentateuch contains five thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight
verses. The Psalms have eight verses more than, and the Chronicles eight
verses short of, that number.

Kiddushin, fol. 30, col. 1.

The number of verses in the Pentateuch is usually stated at 5845, the
mnemonic sign of which is a word in Isaiah XXX. 26, the letters of which
stand for 5845. The verse reads, "Moreover, the light of the moon shall
be as the light of the sun." The Masorites tell us that the number of
verses in the Psalms is 2527, and in the two Books of Chronicles 1656.
