# CLXXX.

A hundred and eighty years before the destruction of the Temple, the
empire of idolatry (Rome) began the conquest of Israel.

Shabbath, fol. 15, col. 1.

The empire of Rome was, some think, so designated, because it strove
with all its might to drag down the worship of God to the worship of
man, and resolve the cause of God into the cause of the Empire.

During the time of the second Temple Persia domineered over Israel for
thirty-four years and the Greeks held sway a hundred and eighty.

Avodah Zarah, fol. 9, col. 1.
