# Seven Hundred.

"For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem
and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread and the
whole stay of water, the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and
the prophet," etc. (Isa. iii. 1, 2). By "the stay" is meant men mighty
in the Scriptures, and by "the staff" men learned in the Mishna; such,
for instance, as Rabbi Yehudah ben Tima and his associates. Rav Pappa
and the Rabbis differed as to the Mishna; the former said there were six
hundred orders of

{p. 209}

the Mishna, and the latter that there were seven hundred orders. "The
whole stay of bread" means men distinguished in the Talmud; for it is
said, "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
mingled" (Prov. ix. 5). And "the whole stay of water" means men skillful
in the Haggadoth, who draw out the heart of man like water by means of a
Pretty story or legend, etc.

Chaggigah, fol. 14, col. 1.

There are seven hundred species of fish, eight hundred of locusts,
twenty-four of birds that are unclean, while the species of birds that
are clean cannot be numbered.

Chullin, fol. 63, col. 2.
