# LXXX.

The venerable Hillel had eighty disciples, thirty of whom were worthy
that the Shechinah should rest upon them, as it rested upon Moses our
Rabbi; and thirty of them were worthy that the sun should stand still
(for them), as it did for Joshua the son of Nun; and twenty of them
stood midway in worth. The greatest of all of them was Jonathan ben
Uzziel, and the least of all was Rabbi Yochanan ben Zacchai. It is said
of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zacchai that he did not leave unstudied the Bible,
the Mishna, the Gemara, the constitutions, the legends, the minutiae of
the law, the niceties of the scribes, the arguments *à fortiori* and
from similar premises, the theory of the change of the moon, the
Gematria, the parable of the unripe grapes and

the foxes, the language of demons, of palm-trees, and of Ministering
angels.

Bava Bathra, fol. 134, col. 1.

A male criminal is to be hanged with his face toward the people, but a
female with her face toward the gibbet. So says Rabbi Eliezer; but the
sages say the man only is hanged, not the woman. Rabbi Eliezer retorted,
"Did not Simeon the son of Shetach hang women in Askelon?" To this they
replied, "He indeed caused eighty women to be hanged, though two
criminals are not to be condemned in one day."

Sanhedrin, fol. 45, col. 2-

We may here repeat the story of the execution of the eighty women here
alluded to, as that is told by Rashi on the preceding page of the
Talmud. Once a publican, an Israelite but a sinner, and a great and good
man of the same place, having died on the same day, were about to be
buried. While the citizens were engaged with the funeral of the latter,
the relations of the other crossed their path, bearing the corpse to the
sepulchre. Of a sudden a troop of enemies came upon the scene and caused
them all to take to flight, one faithful disciple alone remaining by the
bier of his Rabbi. After a while the citizens returned to inter the
remains they had so unceremoniously left, but by some mistake they took
the wrong bier and buried the publican with honor, in spite of the
remonstrance of the disciple, while the relatives of the publican buried
the Rabbi ignominiously. The poor disciple felt inconsolably distressed,
and was anxious to know for what sin the great man had been buried with
contempt, and for what merit the wicked man had been buried with such
honor. His Rabbi then appeared to him in a dream, and said, "Comfort
thou thy heart, and come I will show thee the honor I hold in Paradise,
and I will also show thee that man in Gehenna, the hinge of the door of
which even now creaks in his ears.\[\*\] But because once on a time I
listened to contemptuous talk about the Rabbis and did not check it, I
have suffered an ignoble burial, while the publican enjoyed the honor
that was intended for me because he once distributed gratuitously among
the poor of the city a banquet he had prepared for the governor, but of
which the governor did not come to partake." The disciple having asked
the Rabbi how long this publican was to be thus severely treated, he
replied, "Until the death of Simeon the son of Shetach, who is to take
the publican's place in Gehenna." "Why so?" "Because, though he knows
there are several Jewish witches in Askelon, he idly suffers them to ply
their infernal trade and does not take any steps to extirpate them." On
the morrow the disciple reported this speech to Simeon the son of
Shetach, who at once proceeded to take action against the obnoxious
witches. He engaged eighty stalwart young men, and choosing a rainy

day, supplied each with an extra garment folded up and stowed away in an
earthern vessel. Thus provided, they were each at a given signal to
snatch up one of the eighty witches and carry her away, a task they
would find of easy execution, as, except in contact with the earth,
these creatures were powerless. Then Simeon the son of Shetach, leaving
his men in ambush, entered the rendezvous of the witches, who, accosting
him, asked, "Who art thou?" He replied, "I am a wizard, and am come to
experiment in magic." "What trick have you to show?" they said. He
answered, "Even though the day is wet, I can produce eighty young men
all in dry clothes." They smiled incredulously and said, "Let us see!"
He went to the door, and at the signal the young men took the dry
clothes out of the jars and put them on, then starting from their
ambush, they rushed into the witches' den, and each seizing one, lifted
her up and carried her off as directed. Thus overpowered, they were
brought before the court, convicted of malpractices and led forth to
execution.

Sanhedrin, fol. 44, col. 2.
