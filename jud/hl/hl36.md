# XXXVI.

Abaii has said, "There are never fewer than thirty-six righteous men in
every generation who receive the presence of the Shechinah; for it is
said (Isa. xxx. 18), 'Blessed are all those who wait upon Him.'" The
numerical value (by Gematria) of Him, is thirty-six.

Sanhedrin, fol. 97, col. 2.
