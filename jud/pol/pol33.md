*Funeral Sermon over a dead Rabbi*.

"My lover goes down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to wander
about in the garden and pluck roses" (Song of Songs).

The world is the garden of my lover, and he my lover is the King of
kings. Like a bed of fragrant spices is Israel, the sweet savour of
piety ascends on high, the perfume of

learning lingers on the passing breeze, and the, bed of beauty is fenced
round by gentle peace. The plants flourish and put forth leaves, leaves
giving grateful shelter to those who suffer from the heats and
disappointment of life, and my lover seeking the most beautiful blossom,
plucks the roses, the students of the law, whose belief is their
delight.

When the devouring flames seize upon the cedar, shall not the lowly
hyssop fear and tremble? When anglers draw the great leviathan from his
mighty deeps, what hope have the fish of the shallow pond? When the
fishing-line is dropped into the dashing torrent, can they feel secure,
the waters of the purling brook?

Mourn for those who are left; mourn not for the one taken by God from
earth. He has entered into the eternal rest, while we are bowed with
sorrow.
