*The Talmud: Selections*, by H. Polano, \[1876\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Rabbi Ishmael, the High Priest*.

Rabbi Ishmael was one of the most prominent and excellent among the
fathers of the Talmudical literature. His doctrines are pure, his ideas
sublime, and his explanations clear and concise. He died a martyr to
Roman persecution, and this end has set the seal of truth and conviction
on all the actions and sayings of his life.

There is an historical immortality, as well as a spiritual immortality;
Rabbi Ishmael has attained the former, and he was a firm believer in the
latter. They who imagine the doctrine of immortality to be an outgrowth
of man's vanity, claiming for himself an imaginary preference above
other creatures; they who believe it an ancient fiction, without which
no courts of law would be able to check the natural proneness of man
towards evil doing, could never rise to the courage and sublimity of
martyrdom. To Ishmael, common observation as well as innate principles
proved the truth of his belief.

First, no atom of matter, in the whole vastness of the universe, is
lost; how, then, can man's soul, which comprises the whole world in one
idea, be lost?

Secondly, in all nature death is but a transformation; with the soul it
is the portal to a new and higher realm.

Thirdly, our thoughts and feelings, emanating from the soul, are not of
an earthly nature.

Rabbi Ishmael also advocated with energy the doctrine of man's free
agency.

"When a man enters upon the path of truth and justice," said he, "God
helps him forward, but when he chooses the

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

way of sin, God says, 'I gave thee reason and free will, go thy way,'
even as the trader will wait upon the customer who purchases a good and
pleasant article, while to one who desires pitch or sulphur he says,
'Go, wait upon thyself.'"

Many ask, "Why does God permit so much corruption and evil?" Rabbi
Ishmael answers, "Not God, but ye, yourselves, are the creators and
supporters of moral evils. When a field is covered by weeds, shall a
farmer complain to God? No; let him blame himself for his carelessness
and neglect. Noble, indeed, is the feeling of the man who reflects that
his virtue is his own work, and truely woful is the profligate who
cannot but know that his guilt is his alone. 'To the pure help cometh
from on high,' was the sentence which cheered our pious forefathers, and
which should encourage us."

His definition of sin, too, is far beyond and above the confused ideas
of many theologians.

"Sin is an obstruction in the heart; an inability to feel and comprehend
all that is noble, true, and great, and to take part in the good." If
man is to be freed from sin, his mind and heart must be opened to the
influence of enlightenment. The power of the passions must be subdued,
and all prejudice, selfishness, and self complacency be removed.

For those who entertain the erroneous opinion that Judaism proclaims God
as unforgiving and rancorous, nothing further should be necessary than
to enumerate the Rabbi's classification of the effects of the Day of
Atonement.

"He who violates an affirmative commandment, and repents, is forgiven
immediately.

"He who does that thing which is forbidden, and repents, is forgiven on
the Day of Atonement.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

"He who commits a sin punishable by extirpation, or the death penalty,
may be forgiven through suffering, but nothing save death may atone for
the one who profanes the name of God."

What is a profanation of the name of God? According to Rab, he who
borrows and does not repay commits that sin. Rabbi Abaya says, "A man
who acts so that God's name is not honoured in his mouth."

And Rabbi Jochanan says, "The man who has abased his character."

Why should a violation of the affirmative commandments be so easily
expiated, as is generally believed, since they are so important? The
Rabbi says that sin committed against man is more grievous in the eyes
of God than that committed against Himself.
