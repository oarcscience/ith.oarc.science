*The Bride and Bridegroom*.

There was once a man who pledged his dearest faith to a maiden,
beautiful and true. For a time all passed pleasantly, and the maiden
lived in happiness. But then the man was called from her side, he left
her; long she waited,

but he did not return. Friends pitied her and rivals mocked her;
tauntingly they pointed at her, and said, "He has left thee; he will
never come back." The maiden sought her chamber, and read in secret the
letters which her lever had written to her, the letters in which he
promised to be ever faithful, ever true. Weeping she read them, but they
brought comfort to her heart; she dried her eyes and doubted not.

A joyous day dawned for her; the man she loved returned, and when he
learned that others had doubted and asked her how she had preserved her
faith, she showed his letters to him, declaring her eternal trust.

Israel, in misery and captivity, was mocked by the nations; her hopes of
redemption were made a laughing-stock; her sages scoffed at; her holy
men derided. Into her synagogues, into her schools went Israel; she read
the letters which her God had written, and believed in the holy promises
which they contained.

God will in time redeem her; and when He says:

"How could you alone be faithful of all the mocking nations?"

She will point to the law and answer:

"Had not Thy law been my delight, I should long since have perished in
my affliction" (Psalm 119).
