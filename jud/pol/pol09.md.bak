### CHAPTER VI.

#### DEATH OF JACOB AND HIS SONS--MOSES--THE DELIVERANCE FROM EGYPT.

JACOB lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years, and all the years
of his life were one hundred and forty-seven.

And Jacob grew very sick, and being old and feeble, he sent for his son
Joseph, and said to him:

"Behold, I am going to die. Listen, my son. The God of your fathers will
surely visit you in the days to come, and carry back His people, as He
has sworn, to the land which He has given to you and your descendants.
Do not bury me in Egypt, but in the cave of Machpelah, in Hebron, in the
land of Canaan, next to my parents."

Jacob made his sons swear to bury him as he had requested, and he said
to them:

"Serve the Lord your God, and He will deliver ye from all trouble, even
as He delivered your fathers." He bade them call all their children
before him, and he blessed them and their fathers also, according to the
blessings which are recorded in Holy Writ.

And Jacob said unto Judah:

"Thou, my son, art stronger than all thy brethren, and from thy loins
will kings arise. Teach thy children how they may protect themselves
from enemies and evil-doers." Then turning to his children, he said:

"Thus shall ye carry me, after my death, to my resting place in the cave
of Machpelah. Ye, my sons, and not your children, shall bear me. Judah,
Issachar, and Zebulun shall

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

carry the eastward corner of my bier; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad shall
carry at the south; Ephraim, Menasseh, and Benjamin at the western end;
and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali to the north.

"Levi shall not carry or help to carry my bier, for his descendants will
bear the ark of God's covenant through Israel's host; neither shall
Joseph assist in carrying, for he is a king; his sons shall take his
place, and walk beside his brother Benjamin. As I have spoken do;
diminish not from my words.

"And it shall come to pass, if ye do as I have commanded, that God will
visit ye with happiness and give peace to your children after ye.

"And now, my sons, honour one another, and live peacefully, family and
family, together. Teach your children to love God, and observe His
commandments, in order that their days may be prolonged, for God will
guard those who do justly and walk in righteousness through all His
ways."

And the sons of Jacob responded, "All that you have commanded us, our
father, we will do. May God be with us."

And Jacob answered:

"The Lord will be with ye if ye depart not from His ways to the right
hand or to the left. Behold. I know that great troubles will come upon
ye, upon your children, and your children's children in this land of
Egypt in the days to come. But serve God, and He will prove your
salvation. He will bring ye out of Egypt, aye, back to the land of your
fathers, to inherit it, and dwell therein in safety."

And when Jacob had finished these words he drew his feet into the bed,
and was gathered unto his fathers.

And when Joseph saw that his father was dead he fell

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

upon the cold face, and wept bitterly, and cried aloud in anguish, "My
father; oh, my father!"

And the family of Jacob, his sons, and their wives and children rent
their garments and clothed themselves in sackcloth and ashes, and
mourned for the patriarch. And the Egyptians who knew Jacob mourned for
him also.

Then Joseph commanded the physicians to embalm his father's body, and
he, with all his family and relatives and Egyptian friends, lamented for
seventy days.

After these days of mourning Joseph approached Pharaoh the king, and
said to him, "Let me go up, I pray thee, to bury my father; I will then
return;" and Pharaoh answered, "Go in peace and bury thy father."

And Joseph arose and prepared with his brethren to carry their father's
body to Canaan, as he had commanded them.

And Pharaoh issued a proclamation requesting the citizens of Egypt to
honour Joseph by participating in Jacob's funeral, and showing the last
marks of respect to him. And the citizens, in large numbers, acquiesced
in the wishes of the king.

And there went up with Joseph and his brethren all the servants of
Pharaoh and the elders of his house, and the elders of the land of
Egypt, and the princes and noblemen, and all attached to Joseph's
household.

And the sons of Jacob carried the bier on which rested their father's
remains, as he had commanded. them, and there rested upon the bier a
sceptre and a crown of gold.

And the troops of Egypt followed Jacob's body, infantry and cavalry, and
the body-guard of Pharaoh, and Joseph's body-guard also.

And it came to pass, when the funeral train reached the threshing-floor
of Atad, beyond the Jordan, they rested there, and mourned with great
lamentation.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

And when the kings of Canaan heard that the funeral cortege of Jacob was
approaching, they started forth to meet the same, to express their grief
and love for the departed patriarch.

And Esau, Jacob's brother, came also with his sons and the men of his
belonging, and then the funeral proceeded to Hebron, to the cave of
Machpelah.

But when they reached the cave, lo, Esau and his sons, and his
followers, approached Joseph and his brethren, saying:

"Jacob shall not be buried here; this cave is ours and our father's."

Then Joseph and his brethren were very wroth, and Joseph said to Esau:

"What is this which thou hast spoken? Did not my father, Jacob, buy from
thee, after the death of Isaac, all thy possessions in the land of
Canaan, aye, five-and-twenty years ago, for a large sum of money, that
it might be an inheritance to his children for ever? Why speakest thou
in this manner?"

And Esau answered:

"I sold naught to Jacob."

"We have the deeds," returned Joseph, "and thine own signature shall
prove that the truth is on our side."

"Bring me the deeds then," said Esau, "and all that I have written will
I do."

Then Joseph called to him his brother Naphtali, who was more swift of
foot than the roebuck, and so light of step that he could run over the
tassel-topped corn and it would bend not beneath his tread.

And Joseph said to Naphtali:

"Get quickly to Egypt and bring to me the deeds for the

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

cave, also the deed whereby Esau sold his birthright to our father; get
thee quickly, and return in haste."

And when Esau learned that Naphtali had departed upon this errand he
stopped further proceeding in the funeral rites, and Joseph and his
brethren guarded their father's body and the burial cave.

With the next day a fight began between the two factions; Esau and his
retainers on the one side, and Joseph, the Hebrews, and those who had
followed the funeral train from Egypt, on the other.

Now among this latter party was Hushim, the son of Dan. He was dumb, and
was placed to keep watch over the coffin containing the remains of his
grandfather. Though not in the conflict, he noticed that something
unusual was occurring, and asking by signs of those who came near him
why the dead was not buried, he learned of Esau's interference, and the
stoppage of the rites.

It came to pass, when he fully understood this, that his anger was
roused, and hurrying into the midst of the combat, he singled out Esau,
and struck his head from his shoulders with one blow. Then the children
of Jacob prevailed over their opponents. Of Esau's company forty men
were killed, while the other party suffered no loss. So with the death
of Esau the fears expressed by Rebecca when Esau intended to kill Jacob,
"Why should I be deprived of both of you in one day?" (Gen. 32: 45),
seemed to be verified.

Then Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah, and the sons of Esau
witnessed the interment. For seven days Joseph and his brethren remained
in their houses, mourning and attending not to their usual avocations;
and after this, though they discharged their daily duties, they mourned
for twelve months, and since that time such has been the custom of the
Jews on the death of a near relative.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

The defeated children of Esau fled with Eliphas, the son of Esau,
carrying Esau's body with them. His head was buried in Hebron, where he
fell, but his body they buried at the mount of Se’ir.

And it came to pass in the thirty-second year after the children of
Israel had gone down into Egypt, that Pharaoh the friend of Joseph died.
Joseph was then seventy-one years of age. Before his death, Pharaoh
commanded his son who succeeded him, to obey Joseph in all things, and
the same instructions he left in writing. This pleased the people of
Egypt, for they loved Joseph and trusted implicitly in him. Thus while
this Pharaoh reigned over Egypt the country was governed by Joseph's
advice and counsel. The Lord was with him, and all his undertakings
proved successful. His wisdom seemed to grow greater daily, and all
Egypt delighted in showing him honour and respect. For eighty years
Joseph ruled Egypt, and his brothers dwelt in Goshen in safety and were
fruitful and multiplied exceedingly; and they served the Lord in the
manner which their father Jacob had taught them.

Joseph lived in Egypt ninety-three years, being as a prince of the
country eighty years of that time; and then the days drew nigh when he
felt the hand of death approaching. He sent for his brothers and all
their children, and they drew around his bed.

"Behold," said he, "I am going to die, but God will surely visit ye and
bring ye out from this land into the land which he hath sworn unto your
fathers to give unto ye. And now when the Eternal thus visits ye and
leads ye out from Egypt, take my bones away from here with ye."

Joseph made the children of Israel swear, for themselves and their
descendants, to carry with them his bones when they should go up out of
Egypt.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

And Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years, in the
seventy-first year after the children of Israel had entered Egypt, and
his body was embalmed and afterwards laid in the ground near the banks
of the river Nile. And all Egypt wept for Joseph seventy days, and his
brethren mourned for him seven days as they did for Jacob his father.

Then Pharaoh took the dominion in his own hands, and governed the people
wisely and in good faith.

In the same year Zebulun, the son of Jacob, died at the age of one
hundred and fourteen years; and five years later Simeon died, aged one
hundred and twenty years. Four years after this Reuben died, aged one
hundred and twenty-five years; and Dan died the next year one hundred
and twenty-four years old. Issachar died a year later, aged one hundred
and twenty-two; and Asher followed him aged one hundred and
twenty-three. Gad departed the next year, one hundred and twenty-five
years old; and Judah the year following at the age of one hundred and
twenty-nine years. Naphtali lived one year later, and died at the age of
a hundred and thirty-two years; and Levi died the year after, one
hundred and thirty-seven years of age, living to a greater age than that
reached by any of his brethren.

After the death of Joseph and his brothers, the Egyptians began to
afflict the Israelities, and they embittered their lives from that day
even until the day when they went up out of the land. They deprived them
of the fruitful land which Joseph had given them, and of the houses
which they had built, and the homes they had made for themselves. The
hand of the Egyptians grew constantly heavier upon the people till their
lives became a burden to them.

In the hundred and second year after Israel went down to Egypt. Pharaoh
the king and that whole generation of

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

people had died out, and a new king and a new people who knew not Joseph
held possession of the land.

Young Pharaoh was forty-nine years of age when he was crowned, and as is
customary upon the assumption of authority by a new ruler, his ministers
came before him to tell of the doings and progress of his kingdom. And
these spoke to him, saying:

"Behold these people, the children of Israel, are greater and mightier
than we. Advise us, we pray, that we may destroy them gradually, lest
they so increase in the land as to prove a snare and a stumbling-block
to us. Perchance if war comes upon us they may add their strength to the
ranks of our enemies and drive us out of our own country."

The king answered:

"This is my advice, and I bid ye heed it well. The fortresses, Pithom
and Ra’amses, are not strong enough for their purpose of protection,
they should be rebuilt and with greater care. Let us deal subtly. Issue
a proclamation in my name, saying:

"'A decree of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Every dutiful citizen is requested
to join in the rebuilding and strengthening of the fortresses Pithom and
Ra’amses, that we may be prepared for enemies in time of war. Every
citizen is called upon to obey this behest, and each day he shall
receive from the treasury, wages for the work which he has done.'

"Then at the outset, ye, too, must go to work, and it shall come to pass
when the Israelites come and join ye, that ye shall pay them, as we
promise, each day their wages. Gradually ye and the other Egyptians may
stay away from the work, until the Israelites are prosecuting it alone;
then appoint Egyptian taskmasters over them; and, finally, when they
come to ye one day for what they have earned, inform them that
henceforth they must labour without payment. If

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

they refuse or rebel, be ready, and compel them to submit by force. Obey
my words in every particular, and happiness to ye will be the result.
Our country will be strengthened and the hard labour will reduce the
numerical strength of this people."

This advice pleased the Egyptians greatly, and they followed it
implicitly. The proclamation was issued, and all the Israelites, with
the exception of the children of Levi, obeyed the orders. Many Egyptians
took part in the work also, and daily received their wages, but they
were gradually dismissed, until in about three months' time the
Israelites were working alone. Then the taskmasters, who had been
appointed over them, withheld from them their wages, and when they
refused to work, compelled them by force to resume their labour.

Thus all the children of Israel, with the exception of those of the
tribe of Levi, who saw the snare of the Egyptians, and who having
refused to work for wages could not now be compelled to labour without
payment, were kept steadily at this work, strengthening all the
strongholds of Egypt, making bricks and labouring in the fields, until
the Lord remembered them and delivered them from the land.

But the heavier the burden laid upon the Israelites, the more rapidly
they appeared to increase in numbers. And in the hundred and
twenty-fifth year after the sons of Jacob had entered Egypt, the
inhabitants of the land saw that what they had intended by their
oppression had failed; that Israel still increased. The elders and wise
men therefore appeared again before the king, and said:

"O king, live for ever! According to the advice which thou didst give us
concerning this people Israel, have we done, and yet it has proved
unavailing. The more we have oppressed them, the greater has been their
increase, and

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

now the land of Goshen is filled with them. To thy wisdom we, with all
thy people, look for advice which shall reduce the number of these
people."

The king answered:

"Let me hear from some of ye; give ye advice as to what can be done to
them."

Then answered Job, from a country in the land of Uz, one of the king's
counsellors, and said:

"If it be pleasing to the king, I will venture to speak. The advice
which the king did give us concerning this people was good, and the
course which we have pursued in its carrying out we will still continue,
and the advice which I give now, with permission of the king, is but in
addition to the same. Behold, we have been fearing for many years that a
war may come upon us; we have been also fearing that the Israelites may
so increase in the land and spread throughout it as to drive us from our
own country. Now, if it please the king, let a royal order be issued,
and let it be written among the laws of Egypt, that it may never be
changed. Let this order decree the shedding of the life-blood of every
male born to these Hebrews. If we follow this advice and destroy every
male, we can have no cause to fear treason from this people in the
future."

This advice met with the approbation of the king, his counsellors and
wise men, and the king did as Job had recommended. A proclamation was
issued throughout the land, dooming every male born to the Hebrews to
immediate destruction.

There lived in the land of Egypt a man named Amram; he was the son of
Kehath, the Son of Levi, the son of Jacob. This man married Yochebed,
the daughter of Levi, his father's sister. And the woman bore a
daughter, whom she called *Mir’yam*, for this was in the days when the
Egyptians

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

embittered the life of the Hebrews. Afterwards she bore a son, and
called him Aaron.

And it came to pass in the one hundred and thirtieth year after Israel
had entered Egypt, that Pharaoh, the king of the land, dreamed that he
was sitting on his throne, and raising his eyes, saw before him an old
man holding in his hand a pair of large balances. The old man hung the
balances, and taking all the elders of Egypt, her princes and officers,
he bound them together and placed them on one of the balances; on the
other he placed a lamb, and lo, to the wonder of the dreaming man, the
lamb weighed heavier than all the mighty men of Egypt.

Pharaoh awoke, and sending for his officers, he related to them this
dream, which caused them both fear and amazement. Now among the
magicians of Egypt there was one whom the king considered especially
wise, Bil’am, the son of Be’or. For him the king sent, and desired an
explanation of the vision. "A great evil will befall Egypt in the latter
days," replied Bil’am, the son of Be’or. "A son will be born in Israel
who will destroy Egypt, kill its inhabitants, and carry his people out
from among them. Now, oh lord and king, give heed to this matter, and
destroy the power of the children of Israel and their future welfare,
before this misfortune to Egypt buds."

"What can we do?" inquired Pharaoh; "we have tried many plans without
success."

Bil’am answered, "Send for thy two nearest counsellors, and we will
consult together."

And Pharaoh sent for Re’uël, the Midianite, and Job, his counsellors,
and they appeared before him accordingly. Then said the king, "Ye have
all heard my dream and its interpretation; now give me your advice; how
may this people Israel be conquered ere this threatened evil falls upon
us?"

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Re’uël, the Midianite, answered and said:

"Oh king, live for ever! If it be pleasing in thy eyes, oh king, cease
to afflict this people. They are the chosen of God from the olden days,
and never have they been oppressed with impunity. Pharaoh of old was
punished for Sarah's sake, as was also Abimelech the Philistine, for the
same cause. Jacob was delivered from the toils both of Esau, his
brother, and his uncle, Laban. Thy great-grandfather exalted their
great-grandfather, Joseph, because he recognised the wisdom which God
had implanted in him, and which saved the people of the land from
starvation. Therefore, oh king, remove thy yoke from them and let them
go hence to Canaan, the land of the sojournings of their forefathers."

These words of Re’uël, the Midianite, angered Pharaoh, and he sent him
in shame from his presence. Re’uël went out from Egypt that day unto his
own country, carrying with him the staff of Joseph.

The king then said to Job, his counsellor:

"What is thy opinion concerning these Hebrews?" And Job answered:

"Are not all the inhabitants of Egypt in the hands of the king? Whatever
may be most pleasing in thy eyes, that do."

Then spoke Bi’lam, and said:

"None of the means proposed for the subduing of the Hebrews will prove
successful. Fire cannot prevail over them, for Abraham was delivered
from its power; the sword will fail, for Isaac was delivered from its
edge, and a ram killed in his stead; they cannot be exterminated by
rigorous labour, for Jacob worked day and night for Laban, and yet
prospered. Listen, oh king, to the advice which I shall give thee. By
this means only wilt thou be able to

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

prevail over them. Command that all the male children born to these
Hebrews be cast into the river, for none of their ancestors ever escaped
from the death in the water." <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

This advice pleased Pharaoh, and his princes and the king did according
to the words of Bi’lam. A proclamation was issued, and Pharaoh sent his
officers through the land of Goshen where the Israelites dwelt, to see
that all the male children were cast into the river on their birth,
while the female infants were kept alive.

It came to pass about this time that Miriam, the daughter of Amram, the
sister of Aaron, prophesied and said, "A second son will be born to my
father and mother, and he will deliver the Israelites from the Egyptian
power."

A second son was born to them according to her words, and when his
mother saw he was a goodly child of handsome appearance, she hid him for
three months in her inner chamber.

Now in those days strict search was made in the houses of the Hebrews
for male infants, and many means were used to ascertain the places where
their parents concealed them. Egyptian women carried infants into the
houses in Goshen, and making these babies cry, the hidden infants would
cry also, thus discovering their place of hiding. The women would then
report to Pharaoh, and officers would seize the babe which parents had
vainly endeavoured to save.

And it came to pass after Yochebed had succeeded in

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

keeping her son concealed for three months, the fact of his birth became
known in the above manner, and his mother taking the child quickly,
before the officers arrived, hid him in a box made of bulrushes, and
concealed the same carefully in the flax which grew along the Nile. She
sent Miriam, her daughter, to watch the box from a distance, and observe
what might happen to it.

And the day was hot and sultry, and the air oppressive, and many of the
people came to find relief from the exhausting heat in the cooling
waters of the Nile. Bathia, the daughter of Pharaoh, came with this
purpose attended by her maidens, and entering the water she chanced to
see the box of bulrushes, and pitying the infant she rescued him from
death.

Many were the names given to the infant thus miraculously preserved.
Bathia called him "*Moses*," saying, "I have *drawn* him from out the
water;" his father called him "*Heber*," because he was *reunited* to
his family; his mother called him "*Yekuthiel*," "for," said she, "I
*hoped in God*," his sister called him "*Yarad*," saying, "I *went down*
to the river to watch him;" Aaron, his brother, called him
"*Abigedore*," for God had *repaired the breach* in the house of Jacob,
and the Egyptians ceased from that time to cast the infants into the
water; his grandfather called him "*Abi Socho*," saying, "for three
months he was *hidden*," and the children of Israel called him,
"*Shemaiah Ben Nethanel*," because in his day God *heard their groaning*
and delivered them from their oppressors.

Moses became even as a son to Bathia, the daughter of Pharaoh, as a
child belonging rightly to the palace of the king.

 

Now it came to pass when Pharaoh saw that the advice

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

of Bi’lam did not prove effective, but that the Israelites, on the
contrary, seemed to increase and multiply even more rapidly than before,
he laid additional labour upon them, and issued orders that if any man
failed in accomplishing his full daily task, his children should be
walled up alive in the building in which he worked. This order continued
in effect for many years.

 

About this time, when Moses was three years old, Pharaoh sitting at his
banquet table, with his queen upon his right, Bathia at his left, and
his two sons, with Bi’lam and the princes of his realm about him, took
Moses upon his lap. The child stretched forth his hand, and taking the
royal crown from Pharaoh's head placed it upon his own.

In this action the king and the people around him imagined they saw a
meaning, and Pharaoh asked:

"How shall this Hebrew boy be punished?"

Then said Bi’lam, the son of Be’or, the magician, "Think not, because
the child is young, that he did this thing thoughtlessly. Remember, oh
king, the dream which thy servant read for thee; the dream of the
balances. The spirit of understanding is already implanted in this
child, and to himself he takes thy kingdom. Such, my lord, hath ever
been the way of his people, to trample down those who have dealt kindly
with them, to deceitfully usurp the power of those who have reared and
protected them. Abraham, their ancestor, deceived Pharaoh, saying of
Sarah, his wife, 'She is my sister;' Isaac, his son, did the same thing;
Jacob obtained surreptitiously the blessing which rightfully belonged to
his brother; he travelled to Mesopotamia, married the daughters of his
uncle, and fled with them secretly, taking large flocks and herds and
immense possessions; the sons of Jacob sold their brother Joseph

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

into slavery; he was afterwards exalted by thy ancestor and made second
in Egypt, and when a famine came upon the land, he brought hither his
father with all his family to feed upon its substance, while the
Egyptians sold themselves for food; and now, my lord, this child arises
to imitate their actions. He mocks thee, oh king, thy elders and thy
princes. Therefore, let his blood be spilled; for the future welfare of
Egypt let this thing be done."

The king replied to the words of Bi’lam:

"We will call our judges together, and if they deem the child deserving
of death he shall be executed."

When the judges and wise men assembled according to the order of the
king, Jithro, the priest of Midian, came with them. The king related the
child's action and the advice which Bi’lam had given him, requesting
their opinions on the same.

Then said Jithro, desirous to preserve the child's life:

"If it be pleasing to the king, let two plates be placed before the
child, one containing fire, the other gold. If the child stretches forth
his hand to grasp the gold, we will know him to be an understanding
being, and consider that he acted towards thee knowingly, deserving
death. But if he grasps the fire, let his life be spared."

This advice met with the king's approval, and two plates, one containing
gold, the other fire, were placed before the infant Moses. The child put
forth his hand, and grasping the fire put it to his mouth, burning his
tongue, and becoming thereafter "heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue," as
mentioned in the Bible. Through this childish action the life of Moses
was saved.

Moses grew up, a handsome lad, in the palace of the king; he dressed
royally, was honoured by the people, and seemed in all things of royal
lineage.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

He visited the land of Goshen daily, observing the rigour with which his
brethren were treated, and inquiring of them why they laboured and were
so oppressed, he learned of all the things which had happened before his
birth; all things concerning the children of Israel and all things
concerning himself. Learning of Bi’lam's desire to have him destroyed in
his infancy, he expressed enmity towards the son of Be’or, who fearing
his power and his favour with the king's daughter, fled to Ethiopia.

Moses urged the king of Egypt to grant the men of Goshen one day of rest
from their labour, in each week, and the king acceded to his
request. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

And the Lord was with Moses, and his fame extended through all the land.

When he was about eighteen years old, Moses visited his father and
mother in Goshen; and going also where his brethren were working he saw
an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, and he killed the Egyptian and fled from
Egypt, as the occurrence is related in the Bible.

It came to pass in those days that the Assyrians rebelled against
Kikanus, the king of Ethiopia, to whom they were under tribute. Kikanus,
appointing Bi’lam, the son of Be’or, who had fled from Egypt, to be his
representative in his absence, marched forth with a large army and
subdued the Assyrians, and imposed heavy taxes upon them.

Bi’lam, the son of Be’or, was unfaithful to his trust, and usurping the
power he was delegated to protect, he induced the people of Ethiopia to
appoint him their king in place of the absent Kikanus. He strengthened
the walls of the capital, built huge fortresses, and dug ditches and
pits between

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

the city and the river Gichon, which compassed all the land of Ethiopia.

When King Kikanus returned with his army, he was amazed to witness the
preparations for defence which had been made during his absence, and he
thought that the people had feared an attack from the kings of Canaan
while he was away, and had prudently made ready for it. But when the
gates of the city were closed against him, and he called in vain to have
them opened, he joined battle with the adherents of Bi’lam. For nine
years the war between Kikanus and Bi’lam continued, with severe losses
to the former.

When Moses fled from Egypt he joined the army of Kikanus, and soon
became a great favourite with the king and with all his companions.

And Kikanus became sick and died, and his soldiers buried him opposite
the city, rearing a monument over his remains, and inscribing upon it
the memorable deeds of his life. Then they said to one another, "What
shall we do? For nine years we have been absent from our homes; if we
attack the city it is likely we shall be again repulsed, and if we
remain here, the kings of Edom, hearing that our leader is dead, will
fall upon us and leave none alive. We had best appoint another king in
the stead of Kikanus."

So the army appointed Moses to be their king and leader, in the hundred
and fifty-seventh year after Israel went down into Egypt.

And Moses found favour in the eyes of the Lord, and he inspired his
soldiers with courage by his voice and his example. He attacked the
fortresses in mass, with the blowing of trumpets and great enthusiasm,
and the city was delivered into his hands; eleven hundred of his
opponents being slain in the battle.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

But Bi’lam, the son of Be’or, escaped and fled back to Egypt, becoming
one of the magicians mentioned in the Scriptures.

And the Ethiopians placed Moses upon their throne and set the crown of
state upon his head, and they gave him the widow of Kikanus for a wife.
Moses remembered, however, the teachings of his fathers--how Abraham
made his servant swear that he would not bring a daughter of the
Canaanites to be the wife of Isaac, and how Isaac had said to his son
Jacob, "Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites,
neither shalt thou intermarry with the descendants of Ham;" therefore
the widow of Kikanus was a wife to Moses in name only.

When Moses was made king of Ethiopia the Assyrians again rebelled, but
Moses subdued them and placed them under yearly tribute to the Ethiopian
dynasty.

 

Now, it happened in the hundred and eightieth year after Israel had gone
down into Egypt, that there arose thirty thousand men of the tribe of
Ephraim, and formed themselves into companies. And they said:

"The time, mentioned by the Lord to Abraham at the covenant of the
pieces (Gen. 15: 13), has arrived; we will go up out of Egypt." And
trusting in their own might these men left Egypt.

They did not take any provisions with them, save what was necessary for
a day's journey; they took naught but gold and silver, saying, "We shall
be able to buy food of the Philistines."

As they travelled towards Gath, they met a party of shepherds and said
to them, "Sell us your flocks, for we are hungry."

But the shepherds replied:

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

"The flocks are ours, and we will not sell them to you."

Then the men of Ephraim seized upon the flocks by force, and the
shepherds made a great outcry, which reached the ears of the inhabitants
of Gath, who assembled to ascertain its cause. And when the Gathites
learned how their brethren had been treated, they armed themselves and
marched forth to battle with the wrongdoers; and many fell from both
parties. On the second day the men of Gath sent messengers to the cities
of the Philistines, saying:

"Come and help us smite these Ephraimites, who have come up from Egypt,
seized our flocks, and battled with us for no cause."

And the Philistines marched forth, about forty thousand strong, and they
smote the Ephraimites, who were suffering from weariness and hunger, and
there escaped from the death dealt out to Ephraim, only ten men.

Thus were the men of Ephraim punished for going up out of Egypt before
the time appointed by the Lord.

The bodies of those who fell remained unburied in the valley of Gath,
and their bones were the same bones which rose up, endowed with life, in
the time of Ezekiel, as his prophecies record.

The ten who escaped returned to Egypt and related to the children of
Israel what had occurred to them.

During this time Moses was reigning in Ethiopia in justice and
righteousness. But the queen of Ethiopia, Adonith, who was a wife to
Moses in name only, said to the people, "Why should this stranger
continue to rule over you? Would it not be more just to place the son of
Kikanus upon his father's throne, for he is one of you?"

The people, however, would not vex Moses, whom they loved, by such a
proposition; but Moses voluntarily resigned the power which they had
given him, and departed from

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

their land. And the people of Ethiopia made him many rich presents, and
dismissed him with great honours.

Moses being still fearful of returning to Egypt, travelled towards
Midian, and sat there to rest by a well of water. And it came to pass
that the seven daughters of Re’uël (or Jithro) came to this well to
water their flocks. The shepherds of Midian drove them away, designing
to keep them waiting until their own flocks had been watered, but Moses
interfered in their behalf, and they returned home early to tell their
father what had occurred. Re’uël then sent for Moses, and the latter
related to him all that had happened them since his flight from Egypt.
And Moses lived with Re’uël, and he looked with favour upon Ziporah, the
daughter of his host, and married her.

 

During this time the Lord smote Pharaoh, king of Egypt, with leprosy.
The disease was exceedingly grievous, and the king suffered
inexpressible agony. And the taskmasters who were placed over the
Israelites complained to the king that the latter were neglecting their
work and becoming lazy.

"They are taking advantage of my sickness," exclaimed the king, and
ordering his chariot, he prepared to ride out himself to upbraid the
workmen, and to see that they did not shirk their labour.

And it happened as he rode through a narrow pass his horses lost their
footing, the chariot was overturned, the king was thrown into the road,
and the wheels of the chariot passed over him. The tender flesh was torn
from his body, and the bones, which had grown brittle with his disease,
broke. His servants laid him upon a bier and carried him to his palace;
but when they laid him upon his bed the king knew that his time to die
had come. And his wife and his

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

princes assembled, weeping, around his bed, and Pharaoh wept with them;
and his officers requested him to name his successor.

Now Pharaoh had two sons and three daughters. The eldest son was a man
of foolish habits and excitable disposition, while the second, who was
intelligent and versed in the sciences of his country, was yet a man of
wicked imagination, disfigured, and a dwarf. Yet the king, taking into
consideration his superior intelligence, named his second son to reign
after him.

For three years Pharaoh suffered intense agony, then he died, and was
buried in the place of the kings; but he was not embalmed, for his body
was in too diseased a state to admit of manipulation.

In the two hundred and sixth year after Israel entered Egypt, this
Pharaoh ascended the throne of the land. And he made the burden on the
children of Israel heavy and oppressive; he would not continue to allow
them the day of rest granted in his father's time, but made idleness
during his father's sickness his excuse for depriving them of it.

And the children of Israel sighed in their heavy bondage, and cried unto
the Lord. And God heard their voices, and remembered his covenant with
Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

Now while Moses was living with Re’uël, the Midianite, he noticed a
staff in the latter's garden, and he took it, to be a walking-stick in
his hand. And this was the same staff, the staff of Joseph, which Re’uël
carried away with him when he fled from Egypt. This same staff Adam
carried with him out of Eden. Noah inherited it, and gave it afterwards
to Shem, his son, It passed through the hands of Shem's descendants
until it came into the possession of

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Abraham. When
Abraham left all his [worldly](errata.htm#0.md) goods to Isaac this staff
was numbered with them, and when Jacob fled from his brother's anger
into Mesopotamia, he carried this staff in his hand, and while residing
in Egypt he gave it to Joseph, his son.

 

And it came to pass at the end of two years that the Lord again sent
Moses unto Pharaoh to bring out the children of Israel from his land.
And Moses spoke to Pharaoh all the words which the Lord had commanded,
but Pharaoh would not hearken to them. Therefore the strength of God was
wielded against the Egyptians, and He smote Pharaoh and his officers,
and his people, with grievous plagues.

Through the hands of Aaron God changed the waters of Egypt into blood.
They who drew water from a matting stream, looked into their vessels,
and lo, their water was red blood; they who sought to drink and slake
their thirst, but filled their mouths with blood, and they who used
water in preparing bread, found blood mixed with the dough upon their
kneading troughs.

Then the rivers brought forth frogs, and they entered into the houses of
the Egyptians, into their feel and into their beds.

And still the Lord's arm was stretched forth in anger over Egypt, and He
smote the land with the grievous plague of lice; lice on man and beast,
on king and queen, and all the people of the land.

Then God sent against Egypt the wild beasts of the forest. And they
entered the inhabited cities and destroyed men and cattle, and made
great havoc in the land. And serpents, and scorpions, and all manner of
reptiles, with mice. weasels, and all manner of vermin and flies, and

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

hornets, and all manner of insects filled the land of Egypt and fed upon
it.

Then God sent a pestilence among the cattle; all but a tenth part of the
cattle of the Egyptians died in one night; but the cattle belonging to
the Israelites in Goshen were not affected; they lost not a single
animal.

Then the bodies of the Egyptians became sore and full of boils, and
noxious, and their flesh was greatly inflamed. Yet still the anger of
God burned against them and His hand was still raised in wrath.

And God sent a hailstorm which destroyed the vines and trees, and green
herbs and growing plants, and the people who ventured out of their
houses, and the unsheltered cattle, were killed by the falling stones.
Then great swarms of locusts filled the land, destroying all that the
hail had spared.

And after this darkness covered all the land, and for three days and
three nights the people could not see even their hands before them.

And during this period of darkness God smote those of the Israelites who
were rebellious of heart, and who were not desirous of obeying his
commands. In the darkness did God do this that the Egyptians might not
rejoice thereat.

And after this God commanded Moses and Aaron to prepare the Passover
sacrifice, saying, "I will pass over the land of Egypt and slay the
first born, both of man and beast." The children of Israel did as they
had been commanded, and it came to pass at midnight that the Lord passed
over the land and smote the first born of Egypt both of man and beast.

Then there was a great and grievous cry through all the land, for there
was not a house without its dead; and

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pharaoh and his
people rose up in alarm and consuming grief.

And Bathia, the daughter of Pharaoh, went forth to seek Moses and Aaron,
and she found them in their dwelling singing praises to the Lord. And
Bathia addressed Moses, saying:

"Lo, I have nourished thee in my arms and loved thee in my heart even
from thy infancy, and how hast thou rewarded my care and affection! Upon
me, upon my people, and upon my father's house, thou hast brought
calamity and affliction."

"Have any of the plagues troubled thee?" inquired Moses; "if so, tell
me, I pray." And Bathia answered, "No." "Thou art also," continued
Moses, "the first born of thy mother, and yet thou art here alive and
well before me. Be comforted, not the slightest harm shall come to
thee."

And Bathia answered:

"Such comfort cannot profit me, when I see this great misfortune bearing
down the king my brother, his servants, and his house."

"They would not hearken to the voice of God," answered Moses, "and
therefore is this punishment meted to them."

Then Pharaoh appeared before Moses and Aaron, and he cried to them:

"Arise, take thy brethren, their flocks and herds, and all they have;
leave naught behind; go, but entreat the Lord for me."

And the Egyptians sent the children of Israel forth with great wealth,
flocks, and herds, and precious things, even as the Lord had promised
Abraham in his vision of the "covenant between the pieces."

The children of [Israel](errata.htm#1.md) did not leave Egypt that night,
for

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

they said, "We are not men of secret ways, to hurry off at midnight."
They waited until morning, obtaining gold and silver vessels from their
late oppressors.

Moses took with him the bones of Joseph, and the others of the people
carried up with them also the bones of Jacob's other sons.

And the children of Israel journeyed from Raämses to Succoth. Two
hundred and ten years after their entrance into Egypt, the Israelites
departed therefrom, six hundred thousand men, with wives and children.

For three days after the departure of the Israelites, the Egyptians were
occupied in burying their dead, and after this they began to talk
together, saying, "Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh, 'We desire to go a
three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our
God;' now let us rise up early and follow after them. If they return to
Egypt we shall know them for faithful men, but if they do not intend
returning, we will bring them back by force."

A great host of the Egyptians followed after the Israelites, and came up
with them while they were encamped before *Pi Hachiroth*, observing the
festival of the Lord.

And the Egyptians called out to them:

"Ye have been gone from Egypt five days, and ye promised to return in
three; do ye not intend to come back?"

Then Moses and Aaron answered, saying:

"The Lord hath commanded us to keep on our way, even to the land flowing
with milk and honey, which He swore unto our ancestors to give to us."

When the Egyptians saw that the Israelites had determined to be
independent of them, they arrayed themselves to fight against their
fleeing servitors. But God strengthened

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

the hearts of His people, and the princes, of E«n pt fled before them
back to their land.

And when Pharaoh learned what had happened to them, and how many of them
had been slain, he exclaimed:

"We have acted foolishly in allowing these slaves to leave us. We shall
miss their services in the manufacture of bricks, and in building up our
fortresses. When our tributaries hear of this tiling, they will rebel
against us, unless we take severe measures with these Israelites, for
they will say, 'If slaves can successfully rebel against them, how much
easier will it be for princes and rulers like ourselves to cast their
yoke from off our necks.'"

Therefore Pharaoh assembled his wise men, his magicians, and his elders,
and taking counsel together they resolved to pursue and recapture their
bondsmen.

And Pharaoh issued a proclamation calling upon every fighting man to
hold himself in readiness for the march, and the hosts of Egypt
assembled accordingly.

Then Pharaoh opened his treasury and gave presents to every man
according to his rank, and he spoke to them in urbane and gracious
tones, saying:

"Behold, in wars, the soldier gains the spoil, but it belongs unto his
king, such is the law; but in this instance I will divide equally with
you.

"The law requires the soldier to advance in battle, even in the front of
the conflict, but on this occasion I will lead and ye shall follow me.
The law commands the king's servants to prepare his chariot, but see,
this day I will pre pare it myself."

The words of Pharaoh pleased the soldiers, and they cheerfully armed
themselves with swords and spears, with bows and arrows.

And the Israelites were encamped by the Red Sea, and

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

lifting up their eyes they beheld the Egyptians marching upon their
rear. And their hearts became filled with terror, for the waters were
before them and their enemies behind, and they cried aloud unto the
Lord.

And there was great division of opinion among them. Those who differed
divided themselves into four parties, and Moses replied to each of them
in a suitable manner.

The first party, composed of the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Issachar,
wished to throw themselves into the sea, for they could see no hope of
escape. But Moses said to them:

"Fear not; stand firm and see the salvation of the Lord that He will do
for ye this day."

The tribes of Zebulun, Naphtali, and Benjamin favoured a return to
Egypt. To them Moses said:

"As ye have seen the Egyptians this day, ye shall not see them again any
more for ever."

The tribes of Judah and Joseph desired to meet the Egyptians and to
fight with them. But Moses said:

"Keep your position; the Lord will fight for ye, and ye shall hold your
peace."

The fourth party, the tribes of Levi, Gad, and Asher, counselled a
sudden attack, a surprise, upon the Egyptians, thinking that it would
confuse and weaken them, and to these Moses said:

"Move not; fear nothing; only call upon the Lord to deliver ye out of
their hands."

And it came to pass after Moses had spoken these words that he rose up
in the midst of the people, and he prayed unto the Lord, saying:

"I beseech thee, oh Lord God of the universe, to save this people which
thou hast brought forth from Egypt. Let

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

not the Egyptians triumph, and say vauntingly, 'Our hand is strong.'"

And the Lord said to Moses:

"Wherefore cry unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel and bid them
to go forward."

And Moses stretched forth his rod over the sea as God commanded and the
waters were divided.

And the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea dryshod, and when
they had passed through, the waters returned as before. And the waters
closed over the Egyptians, and not one was saved of all their hosts.

Then sang Moses and the children of Israel unto the Lord in tones of
gladness

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I will sing unto the Lord, for gloriously hath He
triumphed.  
The horse and the rider He hath cast into the sea."</span>
