*Abtinoss and Garmah*.

There was a certain family, the family of Abtinoss, the members of which
were learned in the art of preparing the

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

incense used in the service. Their knowledge they refused to impart to
others, and the directors of the Temple, fearing that the art might die
with them, discharged them from the service, and brought other parties
from Alexandria, in Egypt, to prepare the sweet perfume. These latter
were unable to afford satisfaction, however, and the directors were
obliged to give the service back into the hands of the family of
Abtinoss, who on their part refused to accept it again, unless the
remuneration for their services was doubled. When asked why they so
persistently refused to impart their skill to others, they replied that
they feared they might teach some unworthy persons, who would afterwards
use their knowledge in an idolatrous worship. The members of this family
were very particular not to use perfume of any kind themselves, lest the
people should imagine that they put the sweet spices used in the
manufacture of the incense to a baser use.

An exactly similar case to the above occurred with the family of Garmah,
which had the monopoly of the knowledge of preparing the show-bread used
in the services of the Temple.

It was in reference to these cases that the son of Azai said, "In thy
name they shall call thee, and in thy city they shall cause thee to
live, and from thy own they will give thee," meaning that trustful
persons should not fear that others might steal their occupations; "for
in thy name they will call thee," as with the families of Abtinoss and
Garmah; "and from thy own they will give thee," meaning that what a man
earns is his own, and cannot be taken away.
