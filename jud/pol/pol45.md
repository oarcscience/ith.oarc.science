*The Reward of Faith*.

The Israelites were commanded to visit Jerusalem on three festivals. It
happened upon one occasion that there was a scarcity of water in the
city. One of the people called upon a certain nobleman who was the owner
of three wells, and asked him for the use of the water which they
contained, promising that they should be refilled by a stated date, and
contracting in default of this to pay a certain large amount in silver
as forfeit. The day came, there had been no rain, and the three wells
were dry. In the morning the owner of the wells sent for the promised
money. Nakdemon, the son of Gurion, the man who had undertaken this
burden for his people's sake, replied, "The day is but begun; there is
yet time."

He entered the Temple and prayed that God might send rain and save him
all his fortune which he had ventured. His prayer was answered. The
clouds gathered and the rain fell. As he passed out of the Temple with a
grateful heart, he was met by his creditor, who said:

"True, the rain has refilled my wells, but it is dark; the day has gone,
and according to our agreement thou must still pay me the promised sum."

Once more Nakdemon prayed, and lo, the clouds lifted and the sinking sun
smiled brightly on the spot where the men stood, showing that the
sunlight of day was still there, though the rain-clouds had temporarily
obscured its gleams.
