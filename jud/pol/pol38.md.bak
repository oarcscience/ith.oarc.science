*The Desert Island*.

A very wealthy man, who was of a kind, benevolent disposition, desired
to make his slave happy. He gave him, therefore, his freedom, and
presented him with a shipload of merchandise.

"Go," said he, "sail to different countries, dispose of these goods, and
that which thou mayest receive for them shall be thy own."

The slave sailed away upon the broad ocean, but before he had been long
upon his voyage a storm overtook him; his ship was driven on a rock and
went to pieces; all on board were lost, all save this slave, who swam to
an island shore near by. Sad, despondent, with naught in the world, he
traversed this island, until he approached a large and beautiful city;
and many people approached him joyously, shouting, "Welcome! welcome!
Long live the king!" They brought a rich carriage, and placing him
therein, escorted him to a magnificent palace, where many servants

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

gathered about him, clothing him in royal garments, addressing him as
their sovereign, and expressing their obedience to his will.

The slave was amazed and dazzled, believing that he was dreaming, and
all that he saw, heard, and experienced was mere passing fantasy.
Becoming convinced of the reality of his condition, he said to some men
about him for whom he experienced a friendly feeling

"How is this? I cannot understand it. That you should thus elevate and
honour a man whom you know not, a poor, naked wanderer, whom you have
never seen before, making him your ruler, causes me more wonder than I
can readily express."

"Sire," they replied, "this island is inhabited by spirits. Long since
they prayed to God to send them yearly a son of man to reign over them,
and He has answered their prayers. Yearly he sends them a son of man,
whom they receive with honour and elevate to the throne; but his dignity
and power ends with the year. With its close his royal garments are
taken from him, he is placed on board a ship and carried to a vast and
desolate island, where, unless he has previously been wise and prepared
for this day, he will find neither friend nor subject, and be obliged to
pass a weary, lonely, miserable life. Then a new king is selected here,
and so year follows year. The kings who preceded thee were careless and
indifferent, enjoying their power to the full, and thinking not of the
day when it should end. Be wiser thou; let our words find rest within
thy heart."

The newly-made king listened attentively to all this, and felt grieved
that he should have lost even the time he had already missed for making
preparations for his loss of power,

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

He addressed the wise man who had spoken, saying, "Advise me, oh, spirit
of wisdom, how I may prepare for the days which will come upon me in the
future."

"Naked thou earnest to us and naked thou wilt be sent to the desolate
island of which I have told thee," replied the other. "At present thou
art king, and may do as pleaseth thee; therefore send workmen to this
island; let them build houses, till the ground, and beautify the
surroundings. The barren soil will be changed into fruitful fields,
people will journey there to live, and thou wilt have established a new
kingdom for thyself, with subjects to welcome thee in gladness when thou
shalt have lost thy power here. The year is short, the work is long;
therefore be earnest and energetic."

The king followed this advice. He sent workmen and materials to the
desolate island, and before the close of his temporary power it had
become a blooming, pleasant, and attractive spot. The rulers who had
preceded him had anticipated the day of their power's close with dread,
or smothered all thought of it in revelry; but he looked forward to it
as a day of joy, when he should enter upon a career of permanent peace
and happiness.

The day came; the freed slave, who had been made king, was deprived of
his authority; with his power he lost his royal garments; naked he was
placed upon a ship, and its sails set for the desolate isle.

When he approached its shores, however, the people whom he had sent
there came to meet him with music, song, and great joy. They made him a
prince among then, and he lived with them ever after in pleasantness and
peace.

The wealthy man of kindly disposition is God, and the slave to whom He
gave freedom is the soul which He,

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

gives to man. The island at which the slave arrives is the world; naked
and weeping he appears to his parents, who are the inhabitants that
greet him warmly and make him their king. The friends who tell him of
the ways of the country are his "good inclinations." The year of his
reign is his span of life, and the desolate island is the future world,
which he must beautify by good deeds, "the workmen and material," or
else live lonely and desolate for ever.
