*Passover*.

The feast of unleavened bread, or "Passover," begins upon the evening of
the 14th day of *Nissan* (April), and was instituted in commemoration of
our ancestors' redemption from Egypt, a memorial for ever. During its
continuance we are strictly forbidden the use of any leavened thing.

Moses said to the Israelites in the name of the Lord:

"Draw out and take for yourselves a lamb," &c.

By the observance of this precept they would deserve well of God and He
would redeem them, for when He spoke they were "naked and bare" of good
deeds and meritorious acts.

"Draw out and take for yourselves a lamb."

Draw yourselves away from the idols which ye are worshipping with the
Egyptians, the calves and lambs of stone and metal, and with one of the
same animals through which ye sin, prepare to fulfil the commandments of
your God.

The planet sign of the month *Nissan* is a lamb therefore, that the
Egyptians might not think that through the powers of the lamb they had
thrown off the yoke of slavery, God commanded His people to take a Iamb
and eat it.

They were commanded to roast it whole and to break no bone of it, so
that the Egyptians might know that it was indeed a lamb which they had
consumed.

The Lord said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel that they shall
borrow of the Egyptians gold and silver vessels," in order that it might
not be afterwards said, "The words 'they will make them serve, and they
will afflict them,' were fulfilled: but the words 'they shall go out
with great substance,' did not come to pass."

When Moses told the Israelites that they, should go up out of Egypt with
great substance, they answered, "Would that we could go even
empty-handed," like to the servant confined in prison.

"To-morrow," said the jailer to him, "I will release thee from prison,
and give thee much money."

"Let me go to-day, and give me nothing," replied the prisoner.

On the seventh day of the Passover the children of Israel passed through
the Red Sea on dry land.

A man was once travelling along the road and his son preceded him on the
way. A robber appeared in the path, and the man put his son behind him.
Then lo, a wolf came after the lad, and his father lifted him up and
carried him within his arms.

The sea was before the Israelites, the Egyptians were behind them, so
God lifted up His child and carried it within His arms.

When Israel suffered from the hot rays of the sun God "spread the cloud
for a covering;" when they were hungry He sent them bread from heaven;
and when they thirsted "He brought forth floods from a rock."
