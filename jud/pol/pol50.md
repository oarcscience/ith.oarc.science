*The Destruction of Bithar*.

It was customary in Bithar when a child was born for the parents to
plant a young cedar tree, to grow up with the infant. It happened upon
one occasion when the daughter of the emperor was riding through the
city, that her chariot

broke down, and her attendants pulled up a young cedar tree to use in
repairing it. The man who had planted the tree, seeing this, attacked
the servants and beat them severely. This action incensed the emperor,
who immediately despatched an army of eighty thousand men against the
city. These captured it and killed the inhabitants, men, women and
children. The rivers ran red with blood, and ‘tis said that the ground
was rich and prolific to the farmers for seven years, from the bodies of
those who perished, said to be four hundred thousand Israelites.
