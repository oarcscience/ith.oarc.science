*Prayer*.

Bless God for the good as well as for the evil. When you hear of a death
say, "Blessed is the righteous Judge."

Prayer is Israel's only weapon, a weapon inherited from its fathers, a
weapon proved in a thousand battles. Even when the gates of prayer are
shut in heaven, those of tears are open.

We read (Ex. 17: 11) that in the contest with Amalek, when Moses lifted
up his arms Israel prevailed. Did Moses's hands affect the war, to make
it or to break it? No; but while the ones of Israel look upward with
humble heart to the Great Father in Heaven, no evil can prevail against
them.

"And Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole; and it came
to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent
of brass he lived" (Numb. 21: 9).

Had the brazen serpent the power of killing or of giving

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

life? No; but while Israel looks upward to the Great Father in Heaven,
He will grant life.

"Has God pleasure in the meat and blood of sacrifices?" ask the
prophets.

No. He has not so much ordained as permitted them. "It is for
yourselves," He says; "not for me, that ye offer."

A king had a son whom he daily discovered carousing with dissolute
companions, eating and drinking.

"Eat at my table," said the king; "eat and drink, my son, even as
pleaseth thee; but let it be at my table, and not with dissolute
companions."

The people loved sacrificing, and they made offerings to strange gods;
therefore, God said to them: "If ye will sacrifice, bring your offerings
at least to me."

Scripture ordains that the Hebrew slave who loves his bondage shall have
his ears pierced against the doorpost. Why?

Because that ear heard from Sinai's heights these words: "They are my
servants; they shall not be sold as bondsmen." My servants, and not my
servant's servants; therefore, pierce the ear of the one who loves his
bondage and rejects the freedom offered him.

He who sacrifices a whole offering shall be rewarded for a whole
offering; he who offers a burnt-offering shall have the reward of a
burnt-offering; but he who offers humility to God and man shall receive
as great a reward as though he had offered all the sacrifices in the
world.

 

The God of Abraham will help the one who appoints a certain place to
pray to the Lord.

Rabbi Henah said, "When such a man dies they will say of him, 'A pious
man, a meek man, hath died; he followed the example of our father
Abraham'"

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

How do we know that Abraham appointed a certain place to pray?

"Abraham rose early in the morning and went to the place where he stood
before the Lord."

Rabbi Chelboh said, "We should not hurry when we leave a place of
worship."

"This," said Abayyeh, "is in reference to leaving a place of worship;
but we should certainly hasten on our way thither, as it is written,
'Let us know and hasten to serve the Lord.'"

Rabbi Zabid said, "When I used to see the Rabbis hurrying to a lecture
in their desire to obtain good seats, I thought to myself, 'they are
violating the Sabbath.' When, however, I heard Rabbi Tarphon say, 'One
should always hasten to perform a commandment even on the Sabbath,' as
it is written, 'They shall follow after the Lord when He roareth like a
lion,' I hurried also, in order to be early in attendance."

That place wherein we can best pray to God is His house; as it is
written:

"To listen to the praises and prayers which Thy servant prays before
Thee." Alluding to the service in the house of God.

Said Rabin, the son of Ada, "Whence do we derive the tradition, that
when ten men are praying in the house of God the Divine Presence rests
among them?

"It is written, 'God stands in the assembly of the mighty.' That an
assembly or congregation consists of not less than ten, we learn from
God's words to Moses in regard to the spies who were sent out to view
the land of Canaan. 'How long,' said he, 'shall indulgence be given to
this evil congregation?' Now the spies numbered twelve men; but Joshua
and Caleb being true and

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

faithful, there remained but ten to form the 'evil congregation.'"

"Whence do we derive the tradition that when even one studies the law,
the Divine Presence rests with him?"

"It is written, 'In every place where I shall permit my name to be
mentioned, I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.'"

 

Four Biblical characters offered up their prayers in a careless,
unthinking manner; three of them God prospered; the other met with
sorrow. They were, Eleazer, the servant of Abraham; Caleb, the son of Ye
Phunneh; Saul, the son of Kish; and Jephtah the Giladite.

Eleazer prayed, "Let it come to pass that the maiden to whom I shall
say, 'Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink;' and she
shall say, 'Drink, and to thy camels also will I give drink;' shall be
the one Thou hast appointed for Thy servant Isaac."

Suppose a slave had appeared and answered all the requirement which
Eleazer proposed, would Abraham and Isaac have been satisfied? But God
prospered his mission, and "Rebecca came out."

Caleb said, "He that will smite *Kiryath-sepher*, and capture it, to
whom will I give ’Achsah, my daughter, for wife" (Judges I: 12).

Would he have given his daughter to a slave or a heathen?

But God prospered him, and "Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger
brother, conquered it, and he gave him ’Achsah, his daughter, for wife."

Saul said, "And it shall be that the man who killeth him (Goliath) will
the king enrich with great riches, and his daughter will he give him" (1
Samuel 17).

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

He ran the same risk as Caleb, and God was good to him also; and David,
the son of Jesse, accomplished that for which he had prayed.

Jephtah expressed himself thus: "If thou wilt indeed deliver the
children of Amon into my hand, then shall it be that whatsoever cometh
forth out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace
from the children of Amon, shall belong to the Lord, and I will offer it
up for a burnt-offering" (Judges 11: 31).

Supposing an ass, or a dog, or a cat, had first met him upon his return,
would he have sacrificed it for a burnt-offering? God did not prosper
this risk, and the Bible says, "And Jephtah came to Mizpah unto his
house, and behold his daughter came out to meet him."

Said Rabbi Simon ben Jochai, "The requests of three persons were granted
before they had finished their prayers--Eleazer, Moses, and Solomon.

"In regard to Eleazer we learn, 'And before he had yet finished speaking
that, behold Rebecca came out.'

"In regard to Moses, we find, 'And it came to pass when he had made an
end of speaking all these words, that the ground that was under them was
cloven asunder, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them.'"
(Korach and his company.)

"In regard to Solomon, we find, 'And just when Solomon had made an end
of praying, a fire came down," &c.
