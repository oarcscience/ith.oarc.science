<p><i>Establish peace, for us, O Lord,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In everlasting grace,<br> Nor let us be of Thee abhorred,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who art our dwelling-place</i>.</p>  
<p>We wander ever to and fro,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Or sit in chains in exile drear,<br> Yet still proclaim where&#146;er we go,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The splendour of Our Lord is here.</p>  
<p>Sore-tried, involved in heathen mesh,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deep-sunk as though in midmost sea,<br> Each morn the thought is roused afresh,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who will arise to set us free?</p>  
<p>From rampart and from mountain reft,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Immured in thick and pitchy gloom,<br> Had not the Lord a remnant left,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Death in the dust had been our doom.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>All realms behold our driven seed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like wounded doves we fly their hate.<br> All nations hunt us and impede<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And in the desert lie in wait.</p>  
<p>Gripped as a bird within a net,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ever pursued in deadly chase,<br> With harsh devices daily met,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance our God will grant us grace.</p>  
<p>How many periods are past,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And we in exile lingering,<br> By enemies encompassed fast,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who jeer that now we have no King!</p>  
<p>They plot and league in lying spite<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;God&#146;s truth with cunning to eclipse,<br> Our tongues, they say, shall give us might,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;We own no master to our lips.</p>  
<p>Shine forth, great God, in splendid flame,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bare Thy great arm of ancient days,<br> Be jealous for Thy glorious name,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not unto us, O Lord, the praise.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>To dust the Arab kingdom sweep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The ravenous beasts who tear and bite,<br> Who rend our scattered sons as sheep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose motto is to seize by might.</p>  
<p>Our heritage they have possessed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Exiled, devoured us at their will,<br> Consumed and wasted and oppressed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And machinate against us still.</p>  
<p>So low our nation hath been brought,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So many masters override,<br> A little more and it were naught,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Had not the Lord been on its side.</p>  
<p>Beneath the feet of slaves we bend,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In pit and prison we are pressed,<br> The hunters at our necks impend,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;We labour still and have no rest.</p>  
<p>Where is that kindness from above<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of which Thy servitors have heard,<br> The boon of Thy peculiar love,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For which we have our fathers&#146; word?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>O glorious sovran of the height,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Abase, destroy their topmost tower,<br> The final marvel bring to light,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Arise and save us, show Thy power.</p>  
<p>Uplift the lowly from the mire,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And make our meditation sweet,<br> The lily gather from the brier,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And our salvation, Lord, complete.</p>  
<p>With joy the lost and wounded bless,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wipe from all eyes the tears that run,<br> Unveil the orb of righteousness,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For unto us is born a son.</p>  
<p>O break the yoke, the slave release,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rebuke the arrogant again,<br> And send Thy messenger of peace,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose feet are welcome as the rain.</p>  
<p>Rejoice, my dear despised, the King<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In all His beauty thou shalt see,<br> And this the song that men shall sing<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In Judah&#146;s land, our own and free.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The prayer of the meek finds grace,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And God will hearken and forgive,<br> Tread down corruption, sin erase,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And in His light will let us live.</p>  
<p>My song of penitence He ranks<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As though an altar-sacrifice.<br> Healed of my sins I give Him thanks,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who &#146;spite our deeds remits the price</p>  
<p>Delight and peace from Thee we hail,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hand Thy people&#146;s sin outscored,<br> Drew o&#146;er iniquity a veil<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor gave wrongdoing its reward.</p>  
<p>Perpetual ascend to Thee<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy people&#146;s and Thy servants&#146; cries,<br> O let us Thy compassion see,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Thy salvation greet our eyes.</p>
