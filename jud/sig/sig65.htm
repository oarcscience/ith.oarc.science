<p>Who shall declare Thy righteousness?<br> For Thou hast compassed the firmament of the moon with a second sphere<br> Without deviation or infraction,<br> And within it is a star called Mercury,<br> And its measure to the earth is like one to twenty-two thousand.<br> And it completeth its turbulent course in ten months<br> And is the stirrer up in the world of strifes and contentions<br> And enmities and cries of complaint, <A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A><br> And it giveth the force to obtain power and to heap up wealth,<br> To gather riches and to lay up abundance,<br> According to the command of Him who created it to be His minister<br> As a servant before a master.<br> And it is the star of prudence and wisdom,<br> "Giving subtlety to the simple<br> And to the young man knowledge and discretion."</p>
