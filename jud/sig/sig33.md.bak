### 30

### GOD DWELLETH HIGH

God dwelleth high above man’s dwelling-place,  
Ye multitudes, come praise and honour Him,  
Huzzah before the King whose name is God,  
Sound joyous flourishes upon the trumpet.  
His creatures fear His glory more than man  
When awful deeds are wrought, for dread is He.  
The day shall be when at the sound of trumpet  
Thy people to the Mount of Olives flock,  
And they, according to Thy word, shall go  
With shouting and with tumult and perceive  
The thunders, lightnings, and the trumpet’s sound.  
Regard the people nestling in Thy shadow,  
And trustfully proclaiming that perchance  
Again the Lord of hosts will gracious be  
And marvels once again be wrought in thunder  
And lightning and thick cloud upon the Mount  
And pealing of the Shofar. Consecrate  
Yourselves again to-day unto His service, <span id="page_48">p.

And should again your glad redemption dawn,  
Uplift yourselves sublime above all else,  
And mark the banner flown upon the mountains  
What time the horn resounds. O Lord, whose dread  
Sets all the world’s inhabitants a-tremble,  
Be herald of good tidings to the people,  
So staunch beneath the adversary’s yoke.

Thus when the ram’s horn poureth forth its note  
And ye shall hear the Shofar’s long-drawn peal,  
Thanksgiving offer up to God and song,  
And tell His mighty deeds and chant His praise  
According to the measure of His greatness.  
O praise Him with the sounding of the trumpet,  
So shall the Merciful show graciousness  
To you who cry, and as of old restore  
Your captives, yea the Lord of hosts o’er you  
Shall keep His watch, with trumpet-blasts for warning.
