### 22

### JUDGMENT

My breast I am smiting,  
My own sins indicting.  
  How then canst Thou draw me  
  To strife and thus awe me,  
And bring Me to judgment?

My branch hangeth ailing,  
My eyelid is failing,  
  My aims to derision  
  Are turned by the vision  
Of Thee bringing judgment.

The creditor calleth,  
The dread decree falleth,  
  The awful day breaking  
  God’s creatures sets quaking  
In fear of His judgment.

Through Thy attributes preaching,  
Almighty, and teaching,  
  O weigh aberration  
  In the scale of salvation,  
Nor bring us to judgment.

In Thy merciful fashion  
Award us compassion,  
  That man who but dust is  
  May handle with justice  
The haters of judgment.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

Like a vapour evanished,  
Man is melted and banished,  
  His birth is coëval  
  With a harvest of evil,  
’Tis Thou must bring judgment.

We await—O behold us—  
Thy love to enfold us.  
  Did Thy warning not hasten  
  Our impulse to chasten?  
For the Lord loveth judgment.
