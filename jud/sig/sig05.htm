<p>My soul shall declare to Thee Thou art her former<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And shall Thee as her maker, O God, testify,<br> At Thy word 'Be, O Soul' did she take on existence,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And from naught didst Thou draw her as light from the eye.</p>  
<p>Of Thee she shall own and affirm, hand uplifted,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#146;Twas Thou that didst breathe her in me, and as due<br> For that work she shall pour out her thanks and bear witness<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That to me she was given Thy bidding to do.</p>  
<p>She serves Thee as handmaid while yet in the body,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the day she returns to the land whence she came,<br> In Thee will she dwell, for in Thee is her being,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Doth she rise, doth she sit, Thou art with her the same.</p>  
<p>She was Thine when unborn ere the day of her breathing,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With wisdom and knowledge by Thee she was fed,<br> And to Thee for her ordinance looks, and subsistence,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Indebted to Thee for her water and bread.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Her gaze is to Thee, and in Thee is her hoping<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When like novice in child-birth she cries in affright.<br> O take her torn heart as a sacrifice offered,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And her ribs lacerated for fiery rite.</p>  
<p>To Thee let her pour out her tears as drink-off&#146;ring,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Let the breath of her sighing as incense-cloud be,<br> At her gate and her doorway she watches with prayer,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;She is burning like flame with her passion for Thee.</p>  
<p>She must ever approach Thee as servant his master,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Or as handmaiden looks to her mistress&#146;s eye,<br> She must spread out her palms in request and petition<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And turn herself humbly to Thee in her cry.</p>  
<p>For call Thee she must, nor endure to be silent,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like a bird in the net her one hope is in flight,<br> In the depth of the night she must rise and keep vigil,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For her work is Thy works to declare and recite.</p>  
<p>For Thee she must pine and of Thee make entreaty,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her hand must be clean and as stainless her thought.<br> Her breach do Thou heal, be her hope and her helper,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When she draws nigh redeem her, her sin count as naught.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Behold her affliction, and hark to her weeping,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the sphere of the soul she with Thee is alone,<br> Repay and restore her, attend to her anguish,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When her sobs and her tears her backslidings bemoan.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bemock, O Almighty, the foes that bemock her,<br> Avenge with due vengeance her insults and shame,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In her stress be a rock of support &#145;gainst her foeman,<br> Nor yield up the child Thou to manhood didst frame.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;No enemy came, whose reproach could be borne with,<br> No cruel one hunted her down in her track,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#146;Twas the friends of her household betrayed her&#151;her passions&#151;<br> &#146;Twas her comrade who bloodily stabbed in the back.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I ever am seeking my body&#146;s best welfare,<br> Yet it in return would my spirit undo.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, truly the fruit of the tree in its root is,<br> The proverb "Like mother, like daughter" is true.</p>
