#### VIII.

Thou art the God of Gods, and the Lord of Lords,  
Ruler of beings celestial and terrestrial,  
For all creatures are Thy witnesses  
And by the glory of this Thy name, every creature is bound to Thy
service.  
Thou art God, and all things formed are Thy servants and worshippers.  
Yet is not Thy glory diminished by reason of those that worship aught
beside Thee,  
For the yearning of them all is to draw nigh Thee, <span id="page_87">p.

But they are like the blind,  
Setting their faces forward on the King’s highway,  
Yet still wandering from the path.  
One sinketh into the well of a pit  
And another falleth into a snare,  
But all imagine they have reached their desire,  
Albeit they have suffered in vain.  
But Thy servants are as those walking clear-eyed in the straight path,  
Turning neither to the right nor the left  
Till they come to the court of the King’s palace.  
Thou art God, by Thy Godhead sustaining all that hath been formed,  
And upholding in Thy Unity all creatures.  
Thou art God, and there is no distinction ’twixt Thy Godhead and Thy
Unity, Thy pre-existence and Thy existence,  
For ’tis all one mystery.  
And although the name of each be different,  
"Yet they are all proceeding to one place."
