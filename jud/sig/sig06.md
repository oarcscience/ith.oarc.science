### THE MESSIAH.

Lord, tell me when  
Shall come to men  
Messiah blest,  
When shall Thy care  
His couch prepare  
To be my guest,  
To sleep on my golden bed,  
  in my palace rest.

Wake, dear gazelle,  
Shake off thy spell,  
Nor slumber still.  
Dawn like a flag  
Surmounts the crag  
Of Tabor’s hill,  
And its flame it unfurls o’er my  
  Hermon, the hoar and chill.

From the wild-ass brood  
To the grace renewed  
Of Thy dainty roe,  
O Lord, return,  
For behold we yearn  
Our love to show,  
And our soul with Thy soul at  
  one as of yore to know.

Thrice welcome he  
Who comes to me  
Of David’s line,  
My palace treasure  
Is at his pleasure  
With all that’s mine,  
My pomegranate, cinnamon, spice, and  
  the jars of my old sweet wine.
