<p>Wonderful are thy works, as my soul overwhelmingly knoweth.<br> Thine, O Lord, are the greatness and the might,<br> the beauty, the triumph, and the splendour.<br> Thine, O Lord, is the Kingdom, and Thou art exalted as head over all.<br> Thine are all riches and honour: Thine the creatures of the heights and depths.<br> They bear witness that they perish, while Thou endurest.<br> Thine is the might in whose mystery our thoughts can find no stay, so far art Thou beyond us.<br> In Thee is the veiled retreat of power, the secret and the foundation. <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A><br> Thine is the name concealed from the sages,<br> The force that sustaineth the world on naught,<br> And that can bring to light every hidden thing.<br> Thine is the loving-kindness that ruleth over all Thy creatures,<br> And the good treasured up for those who fear Thee.<br> Thine are the mysteries that transcend understanding and thought.<br> Thine is the life over which extinction holdeth no sway,<br> And Thy throne is exalted above every sovereignty,<br> And Thy habitation hidden in the shrouded height.<br> Thine is the existence from the shadow of<br> whose light every being was created,<br> Of which we say, in His shadow we live.<br> Thine are the two worlds between which Thou hast set a boundary,<br> The first for deeds and the second for reward.<br> Thine is the reward which Thou for the righteous hast stored up and hidden,<br> Yea, Thou sawest it was goodly and didst hide it.</p>
