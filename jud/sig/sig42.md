### 39

### ASK OF ME

"Ask of Me, beautiful mouth,  
  What dost thou ask of Me?  
For thy suppliant cry  
Hath ascended on high  
  Inclining My ear to thy plea."

"First with the lion we met,  
  Next came the leopard’s leap,  
We were fain to take flight  
From our garden’s delight  
  And into a hiding-place creep.

"Hardly these creatures had passed,  
  Sated with Judah’s spoil,  
Than the wild ass we feared  
Out of midnight appeared  
  To trample and dwell on our soil.

"Ishmael’s offspring command  
  Back to his Arab land,  
As his mother of old  
To her mistress was told  
  To return and submit to her hand."
