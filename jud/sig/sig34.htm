<p>Send forth Thy messenger, Thy interpreter,<br> And let him do wonders with signs and happenings,<br> To cleanse us this night from scandal and defamation!<br> Great God, boundless and unsearchable,<br> Thy righteousness is like mighty mountains,<br> Thy judgments are like the great deep.</p>  
<p>Bare to Thee and spied out is the heart&#146;s imagination and secret,<br> Lo, shaped in iniquity, how shall man justify the evil of his work?<br> Can the grains of his dust justify it that were accounted vanity even while he was still in being?<br> How then after he has perished and every element passed back to its source,<br> When he is driven like chaff before the wind and like smoke from the lattice?</p>  
<p>Who shall stand up for Thy people, and who set them free?<br> If for decision Thou shouldst draw nigh them, and<br> if for judgment Thou shouldst take them,<br> Then judge them, I pray Thee, by Thy righteousness,<br> And reprove them not according to Thy wrath. <A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A><br> For what is the weak that he should contend with the mighty,<br> And how can dry stubble stand in the flame?</p>  
<p>Lo, as the flower fadeth and the wind flitteth by like a shadow,<br> So flesh from spirit is rent asunder;<br> If then Thou wilt stir up chastisement,<br> There is no way of deliverance shouldst Thou press hard;<br> For the worker is sluggish,<br> And the day short and the work abundant.</p>
