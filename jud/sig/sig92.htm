<p>O my God, I know that those who implore<br> favour from Thee<br> Have for ambassadors their antecedent virtues,<br> And the righteousness which they have heaped up,<br> But in me are no good deeds,<br> For I am shaken and emptied like a stripped vine,<br> And I have no righteousness, no rectitude,<br> No piety, no uprightness,<br> No prayer, no plea,<br> No innocence, no faith, <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A><br> No justice, no quality of goodness,<br> Neither service of God nor turning from sin.<br> May it be Thy will, O Lord our God and God of our Fathers,<br> Master of the Worlds,<br> To have mercy upon me,<br> And be Thou near me,<br> To favour me with the visitation of Thy goodwill,<br> And to lift up to me the light of Thy face,<br> And to show me Thy graciousness!<br> Requite me not according to my deeds<br> And make me not a byword to the base.<br> Take me not away in the midst of my days<br> Nor hide Thy face from me.<br> Purify me from my sins,<br> And cast me not out from Thy presence,<br> But quicken me with glory<br> And with glory receive me afterwards.<br> And when Thou shalt bring me out of this world,<br> Bring me in peace to the life of the world to come,<br> And place me in glory among the saints,<br> And number me with those whose portion is appointed in the world of life<br> And purify me to shine in the light of Thy countenance,<br> And restore and revive me<br> And bring me up again from the depths of the earth. <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A><br> Then will I say:<br> I thank Thee, O Lord, that though wroth with me,<br> Thine anger is turned away and Thou hast comforted me.<br> Thine, O Lord, is loving-kindness<br> In all the goodness Thou hast bestowed on me,<br> And which Thou wilt bestow till the day of my death.<br> And for all this it <A HREF="errata.htm#1">behooves</A> me to give thanks,<br> To laud, to glorify, to extol Thee.<br> By the mouth of Thy creatures O yield Thyself praise,<br> By those hallowing Thee be Thou self-sanctified,<br> Through those owning Thy Unity cry Thou Thy oneness,<br> With the lips of Thy glorifiers chant Thee Thy glory,<br> And exalt Thee in rhapsody through Thine exalters,<br> Supremely upborne on Thy worshippers&#146; breath,<br> For &#146;mid the gods and their works, O Lord,<br> there is none like to Thee and Thine.</p>

<p><i>May this word of my mouth and my heart&#146;s true thought<br> Find, O Rock and Redeemer, the favour sought</i>.</p>
