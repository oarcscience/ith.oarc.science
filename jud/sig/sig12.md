### 9

### SIX YEARS WERE DECREED

Six years were decreed for a slave to wait  
  When his freedom he sought at his master’s hand,  
But the years of my bondage lack term or date,  
  It is hard, O my Master, to understand.

Why, Sire, should a hand-maid’s son bear sway,  
  And me with affliction and anguish task?  
There cometh no answer, howe’er I pray,  
  In despite that each day for reply I ask.

What word at the last wilt Thou say, my King?  
  An Thou findest no ransom, O Lord, take me!  
Take me for Thy people as offering,  
  I will serve Thee for ever and ne’er go free.
