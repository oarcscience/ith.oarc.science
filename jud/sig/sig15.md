### 12

### ECSTASY

My thoughts astounded asked me why  
Towards the whirling wheels on high  
In ecstasy I rush and fly.

The living God is my desire,  
It carries me on wings of fire,  
Body and soul to Him aspire.

God is at once my joy and fate,  
This yearning me He did create,  
At thought of Him I palpitate.

Shall song with all its loveliness  
Submerge my soul with happiness  
Before the God of Gods it bless?
