### 8

### POUR OUT THY HEART

Pour out thy heart to the Rock,  
  Pour out thy inmost soul  
To the stronghold naught can shock,  
  As the mornings and evenings roll.

To Him who around and before  
  Is, whether thou rest or roam,  
To Him let thy thoughts upsoar,  
  Be thou on the road or at home.

Thus tested by praise and belief,  
  Thou favour divine shalt gain,  
He will turn His ear to thy grief,  
  He will bend His eye on thy pain.

Behold, He will pay thy reward,  
  Thou shalt share the abode of the blest,  
For the day thou return to the Lord,  
  He will draw thee close to His breast.
