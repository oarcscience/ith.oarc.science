### 23

### PRAYER FOR THE HAZZAN

As the servant longs for the master’s hand, so craves the cantor’s
soul,  
O extend Thy mercy upon him, rend his debt-recording scroll.  
"Unto Me return, then will I to thee"—were this Thy word unsaid,  
Like a captain humbled while at his post he now would droop his head.  
To Thy servant, Lord, Thou wilt surely ope the penitential way,  
May his fruit be sweet as he stands to lead our prayers to Thee
to-day.  
As we watch our brother, behold, we note the grey that streaks his
hair,  
And his heart a-swim in a sense of sin as praying stands he there.  
Let the fervent breath of Thy suppliant be witness for his heart,  
Let him but return to Thee this once, he never will depart.
