<p>Who shall reason of Thy greatness?<br> For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of<br> Jupiter with a seventh sphere,<br> And therein revolveth Saturn.<br> And his body is greater than that of the earth<br> ninety-one times by the measure of him,<br> And he completeth his revolution in thirty years of his course,<br> And stirreth up wars,<br> And spoliation and captivity and famine,<br> For such is his appointed task;<br> And devastateth the lands,<br> And rooteth up kingdoms<br> According to the will of Him<br> "Who hath appointed him to His service,<br> Even such strange service."</p>
