#### X.

Who shall utter Thy mighty deeds,  
For Thou madest a division of the ball of the earth into twain, half dry
land, half water,  
And didst surround the water with the sphere of air,  
In which the wind turneth and turneth in its going,  
And resteth in its circuits,  
And didst encompass the air with the sphere of fire, <span

And the foundations of these four elements are but one foundation,  
And their sources one,  
And from it they issue and are renewed,  
"And from thence was it separated and became four heads."
