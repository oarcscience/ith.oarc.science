<p>God dwelleth high above man&#146;s dwelling-place,<br> Ye multitudes, come praise and honour Him,<br> Huzzah before the King whose name is God,<br> Sound joyous flourishes upon the trumpet.<br> His creatures fear His glory more than man<br> When awful deeds are wrought, for dread is He.<br> The day shall be when at the sound of trumpet<br> Thy people to the Mount of Olives flock,<br> And they, according to Thy word, shall go<br> With shouting and with tumult and perceive<br> The thunders, lightnings, and the trumpet&#146;s sound.<br> Regard the people nestling in Thy shadow,<br> And trustfully proclaiming that perchance<br> Again the Lord of hosts will gracious be<br> And marvels once again be wrought in thunder<br> And lightning and thick cloud upon the Mount<br> And pealing of the Shofar. Consecrate<br> Yourselves again to-day unto His service, <A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A><br> And should again your glad redemption dawn,<br> Uplift yourselves sublime above all else,<br> And mark the banner flown upon the mountains<br> What time the horn resounds. O Lord, whose dread<br> Sets all the world&#146;s inhabitants a-tremble,<br> Be herald of good tidings to the people,<br> So staunch beneath the adversary&#146;s yoke.</p>  
<p>Thus when the ram&#146;s horn poureth forth its note<br> And ye shall hear the Shofar&#146;s long-drawn peal,<br> Thanksgiving offer up to God and song,<br> And tell His mighty deeds and chant His praise<br> According to the measure of His greatness.<br> O praise Him with the sounding of the trumpet,<br> So shall the Merciful show graciousness<br> To you who cry, and as of old restore<br> Your captives, yea the Lord of hosts o&#146;er you<br> Shall keep His watch, with trumpet-blasts for warning.</p>
