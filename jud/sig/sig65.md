#### XIII.

Who shall declare Thy righteousness?  
For Thou hast compassed the firmament of the moon with a second sphere  
Without deviation or infraction,  
And within it is a star called Mercury,  
And its measure to the earth is like one to twenty-two thousand.  
And it completeth its turbulent course in ten months  
And is the stirrer up in the world of strifes and contentions  
And enmities and cries of complaint, <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>  
And it giveth the force to obtain power and to heap up wealth,  
To gather riches and to lay up abundance,  
According to the command of Him who created it to be His minister  
As a servant before a master.  
And it is the star of prudence and wisdom,  
"Giving subtlety to the simple  
And to the young man knowledge and discretion."
