#### XXXVI.

Unworthy am I of all the mercies and all the truth  
Which Thou hast wrought for Thy servant.  
Verily, O Lord my God, will I thank Thee  
For that Thou hast given me a holy soul,  
Though by my deeds I have defiled it,  
Polluted and profaned it with my evil inclination.  
But I know that if I wrought wickedly,  
I harmed but myself, never Thee.  
In sooth, at my right hand my fierce inclination  
As an adversary standeth,  
Allowing me no breathing-space to establish my tranquillity.  
Oft have I purposed with double bridle to lead him,  
From the sea of his lusts to dry land to restore him,  
But I could not prevail.  
My devices he baulked, made profanities flow from my lips.  
I think thoughts of simplicity, he fabricates guile and iniquity,  
I am for peace, and he is for war,  
To the point that he made me his footstool,  
And even in peace-time shed the blood of war.  
How oft have I sallied forth to combat against him,  
And set in battle-array  
My camp of service and repentance,  
And placed the host of Thy mercies beside me for auxiliary, <span

For I said, if my evil inclination  
Shall come to one camp and shall smite it,  
Then the camp that is left shall escape.  
As I thought, so it was.  
For temptation has routed me and scattered my forces,  
So that there is nothing left me but the camp of Thy mercies.  
But yet I know that by these I shall overcome it,  
And they shall be unto me better than a city of refuge.  
Peradventure I shall prevail and smite it and drive it away.
