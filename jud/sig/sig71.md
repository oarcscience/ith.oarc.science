#### XIX.

Who shall find words for Thy tremendous works?  
For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of Mars with a sixth sphere,  
A vast and mighty encompassing sphere,  
Wherein dwelleth the righteous planet (Jupiter). <span id="page_97">p.
97</span>  
And his body is greater than that of the earth seventy-five times  
By the measure of her breadth.  
And he completeth his revolution in twelve years,  
And is as a planet of goodwill and love,  
Stirring up the fear of heaven,  
And righteousness and repentance and every good quality,  
And increasing all crops and fruits,  
And causing wars to cease,  
And enmity and strife;  
And his appointed task is to repair by righteousness every breach,  
"For He judgeth the world in righteousness."
