#### II.

Thou art One, the first of every number, and  
the foundation of every structure,  
Thou art One, and at the mystery of Thy Oneness the wise of heart are
struck dumb,  
For they know not what it is. <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>  
Thou art One, and Thy Oneness can neither be increased nor lessened,  
It lacketh naught, nor doth aught remain over.  
Thou art One, but not like a unit to be grasped or counted,  
For number and change cannot reach Thee.  
Thou art not to be visioned, nor to be figured thus or thus.  
Thou art One, but to put to Thee bound or  
circumference my imagination would fail me.  
Therefore I have said I will guard my ways lest I sin with the tongue.  
Thou art One, Thou art high and exalted beyond abasement or falling,  
"For how should the One fall?"
