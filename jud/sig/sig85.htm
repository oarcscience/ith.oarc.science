<p>O God, I am ashamed and confounded<br> To stand before Thee with this my knowledge<br> That even as the might of Thy greatness,<br> So is the completeness of my poverty and humbleness,<br> That even as the might of Thy potency<br> So is the weakness of my ability,<br> And that even as Thou art perfect, so am I wanting. <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A><br> For Thou art a Unity, and Thou art living,<br> Thou art mighty, and Thou art permanent,<br> And Thou art great, and Thou art wise, and<br> Thou art God!<br> And I am but a clod, and a worm,<br> Dust from the ground,<br> A vessel full of shame,<br> A mute stone,<br> A passing shadow,<br> "A wind that fleeth away and returneth not again."<br> To an asp akin,<br> Deceitful underneath,<br> Uncircumcised of heart,<br> Great in wrath,<br> Craftsman in sin and deception,<br> Haughty of eye,<br> Short in forbearance,<br> Impure of lips,<br> Crooked of ways,<br> And hot-footed.<br> What am I?<br> What is my life?<br> What my might and what my righteousness?<br> Naught is the sum of me all the days of my being,<br> And how much the more so after my death!<br> From nothing I came,<br> And to nothing I go.<br> Lo! before Thee am I come, as one "not according to the law,"<br> With insolence of brow,<br> And uncleanness of thoughts, <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A><br> And a lewd desire<br> On his idols turned,<br> And lust showing itself master;<br> With a soul impure<br> And a heart unclean,<br> Perishing and corrupted,<br> And a body plagued<br> With a rabble of pains<br> Increasing until increase is impossible.</p>
