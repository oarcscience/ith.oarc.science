### DUOLOGUE

*God:*

"Daughter of Zion, tried in Sorrow’s furnace,  
  E’en as I swore thy fathers, be at rest.  
I swore it for My sake, and now thy crying  
  Hath mounted to My habitation blest,  
  And I have heard, for gracious is My breast."

*Israel:*

"Obeisance low I made, for I am feeble,  
  Thy kindliness responds to all who yearn.  
Come back, dear Lord, whose name is linked with pardon,  
  No other saviour Israel can discern,  
  Unto his myriad families return!"

*God:*

"Where’er thy origin, whosoe’er thy master,  
  A man shall come—nay, I—thy cause to plead,  
Whoever holds the bill of thy divorcement.  
  Like wall or tower of fire I guard thy seed,  
  Then wherefore weep or heart affrighted heed?"

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

*Israel:*

"Why do I weep? Because Thou keepest silence,  
  Though violence rages and, all uncontrolled,  
The mob destroys, and we as slaves to strangers,  
  Master and man together, have been sold,  
  And no Redeemer do our eyes behold."

*God:*

"Who art thou thus to shrink from man in terror  
  And be dismayed because of mankind’s scorn?  
My angel I will send, as wrote the prophet,  
  And gather Israel winnowed and new-born:  
  This miracle shall be to-morrow morn."

*Israel:*

"To gather me my chieftains Thou didst promise,  
  The day comes not and miracle is none,  
Nor see I Temple built nor any herald  
  Of Peace arrive to be my Holy One—  
  Ah, wherefore lingers Jesse’s promised son?"

*God:*

"Behold, I keep the oath I swore to gather  
  My captives—kings shall bring their gifts to thee;  
Created for a witness to the nations,  
  My holy ones shall testify to Me—  
  Yea, Jesse’s son Mine eyes already see."
