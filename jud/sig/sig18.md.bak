### 15

### FOR A MARRIAGE

Send to the prince’s daughter  
  Her ruddy, fair-eyed king,  
Like a fruitful branch he blossoms,  
  Transplanted to a spring.

Thy Torah has his worship,  
  He runs, to taste its charms,  
Before Thee like a warrior,  
  Accoutred in his arms.

I day by day am waiting  
  Salvation’s promised day,  
Enquiring how and whence it  
  Will come to be my stay.

Restore the tortured People  
  To the friend of her youth divine,  
And bring the two together  
  To the house of joy and wine.
