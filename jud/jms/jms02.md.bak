### PREFACE

TO UNDERSTAND a people—and through it, humankind—is to see its life
whole. This has been a peculiarly difficult task where Jews are
concerned, for the vision of the world has been obscured by darkly
bias-tinted spectacles. If, on the one hand, Christological and
anti-Semitic prejudices have revealed only an infamous horde of
blasphemers and parasites, on the other, a historical perspective
limited by Scripture has disclosed an exalted band of prophets, hounded
and persecuted as prophets must be for their vision and temerity.
Between these two extremes—which have alike doomed Jews to the
unhappiest of careers—a normal people, with all the faults and virtues
of humanity, has pursued its normal course through history, however
abnormal were the conditions against which it struggled. This is perhaps
the greatest achievement of Jewry, that in the face of an environment as
perennially hostile as any people has had to confront, it has still
maintained its balance, it has remained a normal member of the human
family—even to owning, along with its peculiar virtues and faults, the
common aberrations of the human race.

The Jewish people did not cease to live and grow when the New Testament
was written. The two thousand years since have seen a steady expansion
and development of its inner life. New religious concepts were advanced,
the old were elaborated, and always the effort has been to make these
something more than concepts, to weave them into the pattern of daily
life, so that the Jew might live his religion. This was the sadly
misunderstood "legalism" of Judaism. But alongside this formal
development there was a constant elaboration of what we may call "folk
religion"—ideas and practices that never met with the whole-hearted
approval of the religious leaders, but which enjoyed such wide
popularity that they could not be altogether excluded from the field of
religion. Of this sort were the beliefs concerning demons and angels,
and the many superstitious usages based on these beliefs, which by more
or less devious routes actually became a part of Judaism, and on the
periphery of the religious life, the practices of magic, which never
broke completely with the tenets of the faith, yet stretched them almost
to the breaking-point.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If we call these
"folk religion" it is because they expressed the common attitude of the
people, as against the official attitude of the Synagogue, to the
universe.

The rabbis sought to eradicate these practices, or at least to transmute
their offensive features. But their efforts met with only indifferent
success, and they were often obliged to accord the elements of this folk
religion a grudging recognition and acceptance. "Better is it that
Israel should sin unwittingly than consciously break the law."

In this respect the history of Jewish thought runs parallel with that of
all peoples. Everywhere the common folk has existed on an intellectual
and spiritual plane all its own, and it is only in the most recent
centuries that true science and religion have made inroads into folk
conceptions of the universe and brought them closer—if only a little—to
what we call our modern, rationalist viewpoint. In Jewish scholarship
this phase of folk religion and folk science has been sorely neglected.
The tendency has been to impute to the Jewish people as a whole the
ideas of a few advanced thinkers, to investigate philosophy and
mysticism and law, the cultural and religious creations of the
intellectual élite—valuable studies which, however, provide no insight
into the inner life of the people themselves.

This book offers a contribution to an understanding of folk Judaism, the
beliefs and practices that expressed most eloquently the folk psyche—of
all the vagaries which, coupled with the historic program of the Jewish
faith, made up the everyday religion of the Jewish people. It must be
emphasized, however, if that should be necessary, that it depicts but
this one phase of Judaism, a not altogether legitimate phase; the other
has been described in many competent and sympathetic works.

The material here presented is culled from the literature of Germanic
Jewry (described in the Note About the Sources)—the Jewry of Germany,
Northern France, England, Austria, Poland, which constituted culturally
and historically a single community—from the eleventh century through
the sixteenth. It is with reference to this period that the terms
"medieval" and "Middle Ages" are employed throughout the book. The
cultural history of North European Jewry began to unfold only in the
former century, though the community was in existence long before, and
it retained its medieval aspect through the sixteenth century, and
considerably later in some places. However, the year 1600, or
thereabouts, has been selected as *terminus ad quem*, for during the
succeeding century the so-called

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lurianic
*Kabbalah*, emanating from Safed, introduced a variety of new mystical
elements and emphases, and also at about this time the center of Jewish
life was shifting toward the east, where it came increasingly under the
influence of the Slavic cultures. Until about 1600 the North European
community remained fairly homogeneous, and Germanic.

But we must perforce reach back to earlier periods for a complete
presentation of the subject; the Bible, and predominantly the Talmudic
and Geonic tradition, exercised a profound and determining influence
upon medieval Jewish life. It would be vain to attempt an evaluation of
medieval Jewish magic and superstition without according due weight to
the older sources from which much of it derived. (It should be noted
that the Talmudic period is usually considered to have closed at about
500 C.E.; the Geonic extended through the eleventh century.) And it may
be added that the material here presented still possesses a certain
contemporaneity. To quote Marvin Lowenthal, "Orthodox Jewry as the
western world knows it today is to a great extent the heir, when it is
not the creation, of German Jewry." A study of Germanic Jewry in the
Middle Ages discloses the origin and significance of many present-day
practices.

Biblical superstition and magic have been thoroughly investigated by a
number of scholars; the Talmudic period also has been carefully, if not
so intensively, examined; the Geonic period, unfortunately, has received
much less attention. As for Northern Europe during the Middle Ages, a
single pioneering chapter, very remunerative but necessarily limited, in
Moritz Güdemann's *Geschichte des Erziehungswesens and der Cultur der
abendländischen Juden* has had to suffice. The present work, I trust,
will help to fill the gap in our understanding of the medieval Jew.

Jewry has been divided into two large groups, the *Sephardic*,
representing the culture of Southern Europe (Spain, North Africa, Italy,
and latterly the countries of the eastern Mediterranean), and the
*Ashkenazic*, emanating from the Germanic lands and today constituting
the mass of Jews in Europe and the Americas. The distinction is largely
superficial, for fundamentally they were at one in their adherence to a
common tradition and law, and there was an accelerating interchange of
ideas and literatures which kept them united within the embracing folds
of Judaism. But differences are to be noted, differences in cultural
tone which clearly reflect their environments. The Jewry of the Moslem
lands produced the flowering of

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jewish philosophy
and poetry and science and mysticism. The North produced Talmudists—and
a burgeoning superstition and magic. Throughout this book runs the
thread of the remark in *Sefer Ḥasidim*, "As the Gentiles do, so do the
Jews." The notion that the ghetto Jew of medieval Europe was completely
shut off from the temper of his age is false. The people were in daily
contact, and the ideas and movements that swept Europe invaded the
ghetto as well. The Jews were an integral part of medieval Europe and
their culture reflected, as in a measure it influenced, all the forces
operative in the general culture of the period. This was especially so
in Germany—and nowhere more notably than in the folk beliefs that
constitute the commonest denominator between peoples. Jewish
superstition and magic represent another view, from a hitherto
unexploited angle, of medieval Europe.

Finally, I hope that the readers of this book will find in it some
little contribution to our knowledge of the history of thought—not of
Jewish thought alone, but of human thought. For superstition and magic
are universal and uniform in their manifestations, and constitute an
important chapter in the progress of man's ideas; those minor variations
that appear here and there are but reflections of the infinite variety
and ingenuity of the human mind. Professor Lynn Thorndike has made an
exhaustive and rewarding study of the *History of Magic and Experimental
Science* in medieval Europe, as one aspect of the history of thought. I
may express the wish that this present book be regarded as a humble
appendix to his work.

The reader's attention is called to the list of Abbreviations and Hebrew
Titles, and the Glossary of Hebrew Terms, appended at the end of the
text, which may facilitate the use of this book.

There remains the pleasant duty of acknowledging many obligations. I am
greatly indebted to Professors Salo W. Baron and Lynn Thorndike of
Columbia University and Professor Louis Ginzberg of the Jewish
Theological Seminary who have read the manuscript and offered many
helpful suggestions. My thanks are also due to Professor Alexander Marx
and the staff of the Jewish Theological Seminary Library for their ready
aid in utilizing the rich collection of that institution; to Mr. Louis
Margolis, who so graciously assumed the heavy burden of preparing the
index; and to the members of my congregation, *Brith Shalom*, of Easton,
Pennsylvania, who provided me with the leisure to pursue this work, and
ensured its publication. To my wife belongs my deepest gratitude; she
has a greater share in this book than I can acknowledge.
