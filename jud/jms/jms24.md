#### CHAPTER III

#### THE POWERS OF EVIL

<span id="an_3_1">1</span>. Blau, 15-16; *JE*, IV, 514 ff.

<span id="an_3_2">2</span>. *JE*, IV, 519, 520;—Jacob Mann, "New Studies
in Karaism," *C.C.A.R. Yearbook*, XLIV (1934), 221;—see in particular,
*Sefer Ḥasidim* and the works written by or ascribed to Eleazar of
Worms: *Ḥochmat HaNefesh*, *Sefer Raziel*, the commentary on *Sefer
Yeẓirah*, etc. For a characterization of his ms. *Sefer Malachim* see
Güd. I, 162,.—Rashi, Gen. 6:19.

<span id="an_3_3">3</span>. Moses Taku, *Oẓar Neḥmad*, III, 97.

<span id="an_3_4">4</span>. *Nishmat Ḥayim*, III, 12, 13, 14.

<span id="an_3_5">5</span>. Deut. 32:17; Ps. 106:37. Gesenius interprets
this word as "idols" (i.e., "lords" of the heathen, from the root
*shud*, "to rule") which makes room for its later connotation of demon.
It has, however, more properly been related to the Assyrian *šêdu*. "In
function the *shed*," writes Montgomery (pp. 73-4), "is the Babylonian
*šêdu* *limnu*, 'evil *šêdu*.' In the later Jewish demonology the
*shedim* are the hobgoblins, the prevailing class of demons. They are
the δαιμόνια of the Greeks."

<span id="an_3_6">6</span>. Blau (pp. 14-15), discussing the Talmudic
demonology, writes: "Wie sich Schedim, Mazzikin und die mannigfaltigen
Ruchoth von einander unterscheiden, ist nicht leicht zu sagen; nur
soviel scheint mir sicher, dass Ruchoth ursprünglich die Seelen
Abgeschiedener bedeutet hatte, während Schedim eine eigene Gattung von
Wesen bilden, welche . . . zur Hälfte Menschen und zur Hälfte Engel
sind; . . . Mazzikin scheint beide nach ihren schädlichen Wirkungen zu
benennen." Blau's attempt to distinguish among these categories, even in
Talmudic literature, is forced; certainly, if any distinctions existed
at that time, they had been completely lost by the Middle Ages; none
appear already in Montgomery's incantation texts. Both Blau and Levy
(*ZDMG*, IX, 482) regard the *ruḥot* as ghosts, but, as Montgomery
points out, this view is unwarranted, "as the Rabbinic, Syriac and
Mandaic use of the word shows. They are the πνεύματα

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> πονηρά, or
ἀκάφαρτα of the New Testament, the equivalent of the Babylonian *utukki
limnûti*. This development of *ruaḥ* we may trace in the Old Testament
where 'a spirit of evil,' 'the evil spirit,' appears as an agent of
Jahwe; like the Satan such potencies easily passed into malicious
demons" (p. 75). Cf. also Bischoff, 41 ff., where, however, the *shedim*
are defined as fallen angels.

<span id="an_3_7">7</span>. *Ẓiyuni*, 49a; *Maḥ. Vit.*, p. 541, has a
similar list, which differs in minor details. For *lilin* see *Erub.*
18b; cf. *S. Ḥas.* 1462.

<span id="an_3_8">8</span>. *Kid.* 72a; *S. Ḥas.* 1154, 1160; *Rokeaḥ*
216 and 337; *Asufot*, 157b (in Güd. I, 53); *Tashbeẓ*, 315. We also
read infrequently of the *malach ra‘*, "angel of evil," and *mashḥit*,
"destroyer."

<span id="an_3_9">9</span>. Cf. *Ber.* 6a and Rashi; also *Git.* 68a;
*Pes.* 112b; *Mid. Tehillim*, ed. Buber, ch. 91, p. 398; Rashi on Nu.
22: 23;—De Givry, 126; Reichhelm, abbot of Schöngau, c. 1270, who had
received from God the gift of being able to see demons, "describes their
number as so great that the atmosphere is merely a crowd of them; he
often saw them as a thick dust, or as motes in a sunbeam, or as thickly
falling rain" (Lea, III, 385-2).

<span id="an_3_10">10</span>. Cf. *Abot*, 5:6; *Gen. R.* 7:7, etc.;
*Hadar Zekenim* on Gen. 2:3. The word *la‘asot* is understood to imply
that there still remained something to complete when the Sabbath set in.

<span id="an_3_11">11</span>. Disputation of R. Jeḥiel, 15; cf. *Erub.*
58b; *Gen. R.* 24:6; Rashi on II Sam. 7:14.

<span id="an_3_12">12</span>. *JE*, IV, 520; *S. Ḥas. B* 1170; Ginzberg
(*Legends*, V, 109) writes: "The view found in Josephus (Bell. Jud. VII,
6.3), as well as in Philo (De Gigant. 6-8 and De Somn. x. 133-36), that
demons are the souls of the wicked reappears again in the Kabbalah
(Zohar III, 70a), where it is borrowed from Christian sources, while it
is entirely unknown to the earlier rabbis." This conception need not
have been Christian in source; it may well have been current in the
mystical tradition from which both *S. Ḥasidim* and *Zohar* drew, as a
natural outgrowth of the prevalent view that the spirits of the dead
remain on earth, at least for a time after death. Those who were evilly
inclined in this life might be expected to remain so beyond the grave.
In the later *Kabbalah* we find the view that "the sins of men are
'written' on their bones, and after their death the bones so inscribed
are transformed into demons" (*Kiẓur Shelah*, *Inyane Ta‘anit*, 153-4).

<span id="an_3_13">13</span>. See M. Grünbaum, *Ges. Auf.*, p. 93.

<span id="an_3_14">14</span>. *S. Ḥas.* 1950, p. 473; *S. Ḥas. B* 4;
*Ẓiyuni*, 49b.

<span id="an_3_15">15</span>. *S. Ḥas.* 140, 764; *S. Ḥas. B* 1145;
*Ẓiyuni*, 27b; *Nishmat Ḥayim*, III, 23. When a donkey or horse snorts
suddenly at night and refuses to go forward it should not be driven on,
for a spirit or demon is blocking its path. All animals, and especially
dogs, are sensitive to the presence of spirits; when a dog unaccountably
whines and growls this is taken to be an indication that the Angel of
Death is in town, and consequently is an omen of impending death. This
belief occurs in German folklore also, cf. Grimm, III, 449, §454, 450,
§493; Wuttke, 33.

<span id="an_3_16">16</span>. Ginzberg, *Legends*, V, 108, where he
cites the rabbinic literature; cf. *Maḥ. Vit.*, p. 507.

<span id="an_3_17">17</span>. Rashi, *Erub.* 18b and *San.* 109a
referring to *Nid.* 24b and tacitly to *Hag.* 16a; *Ẓiyuni*, 49b.
Ẓiyuni's views may be compared with those of a contemporary German
writer who maintained that demons are immortal, and cannot generate
their kind or increase their number or eat and drink (Thorndike, IV,
281). Such opinions are common in medieval Christian thought. Prof.
Thorndike suggests that the elemental character which is here attributed
to the demons may well explain why brutes more readily sensed them.

<span id="an_3_18">18</span>. *S. Ḥas. B* 1155; cf. also *Nishmat
Ḥayim*, III, 16; Ginzberg, *Legends*, VI, 192, n. 58: according to
*‘Emek HaMelech* (by Naftali Herz b. Jacob Elḥanan,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

a German Kabbalist of the sixteenth century) 140b, demons, both male and
female, have their bodies and faces covered with hair, but their heads
are bald.—Moses Taku, *Oẓar Neḥmad*, III, 61. The belief that demons
could adopt animal and human forms played an important rôle in German
folklore, which thus preserved the older Teutonic belief in gods who
could invade the earth. It was especially prominent in the later
witch-cults, in which, it was asserted, demons were worshiped in the
shape of cat, goat, bull, dog, etc., or accompanied their
witch-mistresses in these forms as "familiars"—cf. Grimm, II, 546;
Summers, tot ff., 134 ff.; Murray, 205 ff.; also N. Brüll, *Jahrbücher*,
IX (1889), 40.

parallels from many peoples are given. Fear of inhabiting a new house
built upon unoccupied land is universally felt, and similar devices
resorted to.

(1889), 21; simulated burial of the patient is a fairly common
therapeutic device, cf. Seligmann, *Mag. Heil- u. Schutzmittel*, 146
ff.; Samter, 1 o8.

<span id="an_3_25">25</span>. Rashbam, *Pes.* 111a; *Rokeaḥ*, 221; *S.
Ḥas.* 1462; Güd. I, 206, referring to *S. Ḥas. B* 462, reads "like drops
of blood" but I have not found such a text in any of the editions which
I have consulted. *S. Ḥas. B* 1153. The belief that demons dwell or
assemble in trees was also strongly held among the Germans, cf. Grimm,
I, 62 ff., II, 539 ff.; Wuttke, 41.

<span id="an_3_26">26</span>. Cf. Lauterbach, *HUCA*, II (1925), 369, n.
31, where the Talmudic and Midrashic sources are cited; also *Ḥochmat
HaNefesh*, 31c; *Orḥot Ẓadikim*, 95b. *Torat Ha‘Olah*, II, 25, contains
the view that certain sacrifices were slaughtered in the north of the
temple area because they served to protect Israel from the demons who
dwell in the north. According to *Raziel*, 15a, the north, which is the
point of origin of cold and hail and sleet and tempests, was, like the
demons, left uncompleted in the work of creation.

<span id="an_3_27">27</span>. *Ẓiyuni*, 48d; a fifteenth-century German
poet, Michael Behaim of Sulzbach, poked fun at a similar German belief:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Auch sagt man wie daz trollen  
In Norwegen sein sollen.  
Nu hon ich verr durchvarn die lant,  
Das mir kein troll nie wart bekannt. (Hansen, 208)

</div>

<span id="an_3_28">28</span>. Löwinger, *JJV*, II (1925), 166, n. 3, 168
ff.; see Grimm, I, 526 f., on the widely held belief in Northern Europe
that a knife thrown into the heart of a whirlwind will produce a
bloodstain—the blood of the spirit, or of the witch who inhabits the
wind.—*S. Ḥas.* 379, 1463; Güd. I, 204, n. 5; this idea undoubtedly
entered Jewish belief from the German. Thor (Donar), the Teutonic god of
thunder and storms, was believed to fling wedge-shaped stones down from
the heavens, a belief parallel to the classical and Oriental conceptions
of gods who

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

rain shafts and bolts upon the earth during storms. The gradual
transformation of the heathen gods into demons, under the influence of
Christianity, did not affect such attributes, and we find them displayed
by the spirits of a later age. "Uralter Glaube war es, dass von den
Elben gefährliche Pfeile aus der Luft herabgeschossen werden"; cf.
Grimm, I, 138 ff., 149, 381.

<span id="an_3_29">29</span>. The demonology and Satan lore of the
Christian peoples (especially in Northern Europe) were strongly colored
by the residue of heathen mythology which popular Christianity
incorporated. The old gods and heroes and spirits lived on as Satanic
creatures, with their old attributes and characters unaltered. As Wuttke
(p. 36) writes: "Der Teufel des Volksglaubens ist eine bestimmte,
sinnlich wahrnehmbare, körperliche Gestalt, die in allen ihren
Besonderheiten dem Heidentume entlehnt ist and in den christlichen
Urkunden gar keinen Anknüpfungspunkt hat, and auch seine meisten
geistigen Eigentümlichkeiten sind heidnischen Ursprungs." The Jews of
the Middle Ages, on the other hand, were far distant in time from their
heathen origins, and such elements had long since disappeared or had
been so effectively disguised as to have lost their influence in popular
belief. It is significant, in this connection, that a thirteenth-century
gloss to Ezek. 9:3 identifies "the man clothed in linen" of the vision
as the ‏טובלא‎ (*tiuvel*, *Teufel*) rather than by a Hebrew term
(Perles, *Beiträge*, 150).

<span id="an_3_30">30</span>. *Raben*, 271, confused Shibbeta with the
demons of uncleanness, which rest on unwashed hands, rather than on
foodstuffs. R. Tam, however (*Tos. Yoma*, 77b and *Ḥul.* 7b; cf.
*Semag*, I, 69), stated specifically that Shibbeta is not such a spirit.
In either case washing the hands destroys or removes the spirit. Raben
says of Shibbeta that he twists and breaks children's necks. See also
*Joseph Omeẓ*, 349.

<span id="an_3_31">31</span>. For the Talmudic references to these
demons see Jastrow's *Dictionary* s. v.; cf. Abrahams, *Ethical Wills*,
48-9 and Rashi, Ps. 91:6.—See Grünbaum, *Ges. Auf.*, 97, and Löwinger in
*JJV*, II (1925), 157 ff.;—Rashi, II Sam. 7:14; *‘Emek HaMelech*,
*Tikkune HaTeshubah* 6, *Kiriat Arba‘* 126; *S. Ḥas.* 1512.

<span id="an_3_32">32</span>. Shab. 151b;—*San.* 96a; *Nid.*
16b;—Abrahams, op. cit., 48, "Do not leave an infant alone in the house
by day or night, nor pass thou the night alone in any abode. For under
such circumstances Lilit seizes man or child in her fatal embrace."—A
similar conception of the seductive demoness is to be found in the
Avesta; in Babylonia Lilit was called *ardad lili*, the "maid of the
night." See Zoller, *Filologische Schriften*, III (1929), 122. One
version of the Lilit legend has her deliver over to the prophet Elijah
fifteen (or seventeen) of her names, which were to be used to keep off
her unwelcome presence (cf. Gaster, *MGWJ*, XXIX \[1880\], 557 f.) .
These names of Lilit were not known, or at least not used, in the Middle
Ages.

<span id="an_3_33">33</span>. See the following for a discussion of the
origin and development of the Lilit concept: I. Lévi, *REJ*, LXVIII
(1914), 15 ff.; M. Gaster, *MGWJ*, XXIX (1880), 554 ff. and *Folk-Lore*,
XI (1900), 157 ff.; I. Zoller, *Rivista di Antropologia*, XXVII (Rome
1926), and *Filologische Schriften*, III (1929), 121 ff.; Bamberger,
*JJV*, I (1923), 320 ff.; and Ginzberg's comment in his *Legends*, V,
87, n. 40. These writers are mainly interested in the lady's origins and
do not specifically tackle the problem of her change of character in
post-Talmudic times. Levi, however, does consider this question, and it
is his opinion that the lamia aspect of Lilit is not part of the same
tradition as the Talmudic version, and represents late borrowing from
non-Jewish sources. While the germ of the later concept is
unquestionably to be found in the Talmudic literature (Felix Perles,
*Orientalistische Literaturzeitung*, XVIII \[Leipzig 1915\], 180, has
pointed out two passages in the Midrash that imply the Lamaššu character
of Lilit, one of them making her eat her own children), its development
was fostered by outside influences,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

as Lévi suggests. Gaster (in *MGWJ*) also suggests that the later Lilit
legend represents the fusion of two folkloristic streams, the Talmudic
and an oriental source, which he considers to have been Manichæan. This
last, he shows in a fascinating folkloristic excursion, was also
utilized by Bogomil, who in the tenth century founded in Bulgaria the
neo-Manichæan sect which influenced, in somewhat altered form, the
Albigenses in Southern France, and became the fountain out of which
sprang a whole series of Eastern European legends. Gaster, then, places
the fusing of these two elements in the East, during the tenth century
or somewhat earlier; it was during this period that Bogomil lived, and
that the *Alphabet of Ben Sira*, which contains the earliest Jewish
version of this legend, was composed. However, the Lilit legend makes a
much earlier appearance, as Gaster himself later pointed out
(*Folk-Lore*), in a passage in the Testament of Solomon, ch. 57 (*JQR*,
OS, XI \[1899\], 16), and Montgomery (76 ff.) has published a series of
Aramaic incantations dating from about the seventh century, which show
clearly that Lilit was already, at that time, possessed of both the
older Lilit and the Lamaššu characters. This is close enough to Talmudic
times to make it fairly certain that the dual character of Lilit had
already been fashioned during the late Talmudic period, and was
beginning to assert itself in Midrashic texts. It is important to
remember, however, that fertility spirits are indigenous among all
peoples, and that psychologically it is natural to expect that a spirit
that desires men for herself will be jealous of the women who displace
her, and will seek to harm them and their children. Such a development
is especially to be expected when the fertility spirit already possesses
the attributes of a night- or wind-demon which attacks men, as in this
case. My point is that it is possible to belabor unduly the search for
origins outside of the folk-mind and the folk-tradition.

I have used the text of "The Alphabet of Ben Sira," version B, printed
in Eisenstein's *Oẓar Midrashim* (N. Y. 1915) I, 46-7; cf. also
*Tishbi*, s. v. *Lilit*. Other conceptions of Lilit persisted in the
Middle Ages, but we find no trace of them in Northern Europe. According
to David de Pomis (*Ẓemaḥ David*, Venice 1587, p. 73), Lilit is a wild
animal, or an evil spirit, or, as some say, a bird, which flits about
alone at night and fills the air with its wailing. Solomon b. Abraham
ibn Parḥon (in his *Maḥberet Ha‘Aruch*, written in Salerno in 1160),
while he followed the folk-etymology, deriving the name from *layil*,
"night," approached closely the standpoint of modern scholarship which
sees in Lilit a wind-demon, when he said that "Lilit grows out of the
wind just as the salamander grows from the fire." See Zoller,
*Filologische Schriften*, III, 128-9, and Ginzberg, loc. cit.

<span id="an_3_34">34</span>. Estrie, Old French, from the Latin,
*strix*, *striga*, cf. Grimm, II, 868. στριέ originally signified the
night-owl; in the early Middle Ages it came to mean the same as the
German *Hexe*, "worunter man sich bald eine alte, bald eine junge Frau
denkt." The word appears in various forms; cf. Rashi, *Git.* 69a; *S.
Ḥas.* 1465; *Ḥochmat HaNefesh* 17a; *Rokeaḥ* 316; Güd. I, 203, n. 4, and
n. 8; *Toledot Adam veḤavah*, 28:1, p. 182b; *Ẓiyuni* 9a.

*Broxa*, "maleficas et sortilegas mulierculas . . . quae vulgariter
Broxæ nuncupantur" (Ducange, s. v.); Spanish, *bruxa;* Provencal,
*bruesche;* originally denoted an unwholesome night-bird, and came like
*strix* to mean "witch"; cf. Grimm, II, 86g. It appears in *Toledot
Adam*, loc. cit., and in Güd., loc. cit., n. 4.

*Mare*—the origin of this word is uncertain, cf. Grimm, I, 384; *S.
Ḥas.* 1465; *Ḥochmat HaNefesh* 26c; Güd., loc. cit., n. 6 and n. 8;
*Ẓiyuni*, 9a.

*Werwolf*—*S. Ḥas.* 1465; Güd., loc. cit., n. 4 and n. 8; cf. also
Ginzberg, *Adolf Schwarz Festschrift*, Berlin 1917, P. 331.

<span id="an_3_35">35</span>. *S. Ḥas.* 1465; *Ẓiyuni* 9a; Güd., loc.
cit., n. 8. The following, from Ginzberg, *Legends*, V, 203-4, is also
of interest here: "The German mystics (cf. *Ẓiyuni*,

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

end of Noah) identify the woodmen, werwolves and similar monsters, known
in German folklore, with the builders of the tower of Babel, and further
maintain that they were Japhethites, who were punished in this manner."
The source of this view is *Midrash Aggadah*, Gen. 111:8, which "remarks
that when the tower fell, some of the people found inside were thrown
into the water, others into the forest, while still others into the
desert; the first became water-sprites, the second apes, and the third
demons." Here we have in essence an expression of the view that the
wicked become demons.

<span id="an_3_36">36</span>. Cf. *S. Ḥas.* 1465, 1466; *Rokeaḥ* 316;
Güd., loc. cit.

<span id="an_3_37">37</span>. *S. Ḥas.* 1465-7; *Testament of Judah the
Pious*, 5; *Rokeaḥ*, loc. cit.

<span id="an_3_38">38</span>. *Ẓiyuni*, 9a, which adds that some
Kabbalists call these creatures "stones," "night wolves," and "Satans."
*Ḥochmat HaNefesh* 30d speaks of "forest women," who travel in groups of
nine (the *Waldfrauen*, *Waldweiber*, *Waldgeister*, were very popular
characters in German mythology and folklore; cf. Grimm, I, 358f.; Wuttke
47). This passage also mentions a type of demon whose feet are
constructed backward, heels in front and toes behind; the sense is not
altogether clear.—*Ḥochmat HaNefesh*, 26c; Güd., loc. cit., n. 6; cf.
Grimm, I, 384: "Dich hat geriten der mar"; Wuttke, 272 f.; cf. also
Rashi's use of *caucher*, *calcare*, in his comment on Ex. 9:17.

<span id="an_3_39">39</span>. Güd., loc. cit., n. 8; *Ẓiyuni* 7a;
Perles, *Beiträge*, 125; cf. Wuttke, 277; *S. Ḥas.* 1465.

<span id="an_3_40">40</span>. *Ḥochmat HaNefesh* 17a lists the following
obscure types: ‏זחולפו‎ which Güd., loc. cit., n. 7, suggests may be an
error for werwolf, which seems unlikely; this creature also preys on
humans; ‏בורוקולי‎: (which in *Nishmat Ḥayim* occurs as ‏בורקולאקאם‎;
Güd. II, 366, thinks this may be a rendering of the old Slavic,
*vrkodlak*, *vrkodlak*, which appears in Bulgarian and Slovakian as
*vrkolak*, and in the White Russian dialect as *wowkolak*—"werwolf." But
it is unlikely that this Slavic word should be found domesticated in
Western Germany at the beginning of the thirteenth century); ‏מיכיארו‎
and ‏יקונופו‎; cf. Güd. I, 217, n. 5. Perles (*MGWJ*, XXIX \[1880\],
334) suggests that the former word is probably *megære* or *chimæra*.
Güd. (II, 336) thinks it may be a corruption of the Italian *maliardo*,
"sorcerer."

Blondheim and Darmesteter, *Gloses Françaises . de Raschi*, Paris 1929,
p. 102. Tos. *Me‘ila*, loc. cit., has ‏למ״טוך‎, "a spirit having the
appearance of a child, which teases and annoys the women." This word may
be a provincial term for one of the *lutins;* or, as Grünbaum (*Ges.
Auf.*, 205) suggests, perhaps it should be read ‏לעטוך‎, *Létiches*,
*Letices*, which are "Petits animaux très blancs et très agiles; aussi
les prend on pour des esprits doux et folâtres, les âmes des enfants
morts sans baptême." (Am. Bosquet, *La Normandie*, 214). This
corresponds closely with the description in *Tos. Me‘ila*.

<span id="an_3_44">44</span>. Perles, *Beiträge*, 146, 147 (from a
thirteenth-century manuscript); cf. Grimm, I, 365 f. and Wuttke, 46.

<span id="an_3_45">45</span>. *Responsa* of Meir of Rothenburg, ed.
Cremona, 24; *Tos. Yoma* 54b; cf. Grimm, I, 404 f. The *nixe* was often
pictured as a mermaid, cf. Wuttke, 48-9. According to ancient German
myth the nixies drag people who unwarily go in swimming into the depths,
where they drain their blood and then let their souls float up to the
surface to take refuge under overturned pots and dishes; unless

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

someone turns these vessels right side up and releases the captive
spirits, they force them to join the ranks of the water spirits. This
must be the source of the belief, encountered among Germans and Jews,
that in order to discover the spot where the body of a drowned person
has come to rest one should let a wooden dish float freely until it
stops of its own accord; directly beneath it the corpse will be found.
The Jewish authority who calls this belief to our attention, while
himself faintly skeptical, suggests that it is a godsend for all women
whose husbands have been drowned, but who cannot remarry because proof
of their widowhood is lacking (Wuttke, 50, 255; Grimm, I, 411; *Joseph
Omeẓ*, 352).

<span id="an_3_46">46</span>. Rashi, *Bek.* 8a. The commentary on the
*Targum* by David b. Jacob Szczebrzeszyn (Prague 1609) interprets the
‏בני ימא‎ of Targum II to Esther 1:2 as ‏וושר ווייבר בל״א‎,
*Wasserweib*, mhd. wazzerwip—"water-nymph, water-sprite" (see Perles,
*Graetz Jubelschrift*, 9 and Grimm, I, 360 f.). Ginzberg (*Legends*, V,
53, n. 168) writes, "It is uncertain whether this statement of Rashi is
based on a different text or whether, influenced by the belief in fays
and naiads, prevalent in the Middle Ages all through Europe, Rashi
ascribes to the Talmud something which is alien to it." Since Rashi
writes, "There are fish in the sea which are half human and half fish,
called in French ‏שרוונ״א‎," he obviously has in mind the mermaids; we
have seen that he does not hesitate to introduce other medieval spirits
into his commentary. The Tos. on this passage interprets it in strict
consonance with the text as we have it. The term "siren" occurs once or
twice in Talmudic literature; see Jastrow, *Dictionary*, s. v. *sironi*.
Lauterbach, *HUCA*, XI (1936), 214 ff., discusses Jewish beliefs
concerning spirits that reside in bodies of water.

<span id="an_3_47">47</span>. *S. Ḥas.* 1463; Güd. I, 205, n. 3;—*S.
Ḥas.* 379. The dragon plays a dual rôle in medieval folklore, appearing
in his more familiar form, as a fire-spitting serpent (which, however,
is afraid of thunder), and as a demon who may enter a house in the shape
of a man. (See, *e.g.*, Thorndike, II, 562, and Wuttke, 45.) This
account, incorporating elements of both rôles, is a transcription of
some medieval folk-tale.

<span id="an_3_48">48</span>. Cf. *JE*, II, 529, and Grünbaum, *Ges.
Auf.*, 229; see also Wuttke, 27, 66, Grimm, I, 51.—S. Krauss (*MJV*,
LIII \[1915\], 3 ff.) examined the evidence painstakingly and reached
the following conclusions which invalidate this popular theory: the
so-called plaits are not plaits at all, but really two intertwined arms;
this particular shape was not universally required or utilized among
German Jews; the name *Berches* has nothing to do with the goddess
Perchta, but is derived from the Old High German *bergit*, *berchit*,
which designated the loaf also known as *Brezel*, *Prezel*, from the
Middle Latin *bracellus*, *brachellus*, which, in turn, meant "arms."
Krauss is very persuasive. Cf. also B. Kohlbach, "Das Zopfgebäck im
jüdischen Ritus," *Ztschr. Ver. Volksk.*, XXIV (1914), 265-71.

<span id="an_3_49">49</span>. *Or Zarua*, I, 362; *Agguda*, 72b;
*Mordecai, Niddah* 1086, p. 85e; cf. Güd. I, 215, n. 7 and Perles,
*MGWJ*, XXIX (1880), 333.—Grimm, I, 384: "Der Nachthalb, Nachtmar,
wickelt Haar der Menschen, Mähne and Schweif der Pferde in Knoten." In
Tsarist Russia peasants kept a goat in the stable at night to frighten
off demons from entangling the horses’ manes.

<span id="an_3_50">50</span>. Cf. Perles, in *Graetz Jubelschrift*, 25
ff., where the subject is examined in detail; also Landau, *MGJV*, IV
(1899), 146; Grimm, I, 220 ff.

<span id="an_3_51">51</span>. *Responsa* of Moses Minz, 19; also Perles,
loc. cit.; Landau, loc. cit. and *Ztschr. Ver. Volksk.*, IX (1899),

ff. Perles suggested that the second element of the term, *kreisch*, was
a corruption of the word *Kreis* (mhd. *kreiz*), "circle." The most
potent protection against Lilit was afforded by a magic circle drawn
around the bed of the

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

lying-in woman and her baby, a practice known and observed at an early
time. Perles thinks that we have in the word *kreisch*, or *kreiz*, a
reminiscence of a similar device employed against Holle. The facts,
however, do not warrant this stretching of a point, and, indeed, favor
the earlier interpretation which included the shouting in the title;
moreover, noise is as orthodox and effective an anti-demonic measure as
the magic circle, and there is no warrant in the ceremony for ruling out
one in favor of the other.

<span id="an_3_52">52</span>. Perles, loc. cit., 24-5; Grimm, I, 377 and
II, 780. Prof. Ginzberg called my attention to the connection between
the prescription that the egg must be laid on a Thursday and the
creation of fowl on that day (Gen. 1: 20); cf. also [p.
129](jms11.htm#page_129.md) above.
