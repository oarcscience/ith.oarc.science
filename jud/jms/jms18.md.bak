### ASTROLOGY

WE POSSESS no one body of doctrine that describes so pervasive and
dominant a pattern in the fabric of modern life as did the "science" of
astrology in the medieval. According to one of the foremost students of
the Middle Ages, Prof. Lynn Thorndike, "Astrology is the most
widespread, as it is the most pseudo-scientific of any variety of the
magic arts. Indeed, it has ceased to be merely one method of divination
and claims to study and disclose the universal law of nature in the rule
of the stars, by which every fact in nature and every occult influence
in magic may be explained"; it is "the fundamental doctrine of the
medieval *Weltanschauung*." Just as among Christians barely a murmur of
opposition was heard, so Maimonides was the sole Jewish authority of
prominence who dared raise his voice against this superstition. "Know
ye, my masters," he wrote to the congregation in Marseilles, "that all
those matters that appertain to astrology in no wise constitute a true
science, but are wholly folly. . . ." His was "a voice crying in the
wilderness." Menasseh b. Israel once more expressed the prevailing view
when he scornfully waved aside the Maimonidean strictures with a series
of citations from Jewish and non-Jewish literature. "And now, since the
God-given *Torah* and the words of our rabbis prove the truth of this
science, who can deny it?" he challenged. "In all periods there have
been great astrologers among our people, and most notably in the land of
Spain." It is true that astrology produced its foremost Jewish exponents
and practitioners in the south of Europe—many a court, lay and
ecclesiastical, in the Provence and Spain, boasted its Jewish
astrologer; the northerners were amateurs by comparison. I have found
not a single trustworthy reference to a recognized Jewish astrologer in
Germany and France—an instance, perhaps, of typical northern
parochialism which rigorously excluded the Jew from court attendance,
or, again, a commentary on the inferior

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

quality of his skill. But, however short he may have been on theory, the
German Jew was by no means unacquainted with the practical utilities of
the science.[1](jms37.htm#an_16_1.md) Though the literature is not as
informative as one might wish, we may derive from it those general rules
which were the bases of the astrological science.

The debate over the determining rôle of the stars in the life of man,
broached in the Bible and heatedly argued in the pages of the Talmud,
continued unabated through the succeeding centuries. The issue was
hardly at all whether the stars influence men but rather just how vital
and irremediable their influence is. It was generally accepted that
every man has his star in heaven (often regarded as complementary to his
"deputy" angel), whose history is conterminous with his own, that the
special character and position of that star at his birth determine the
general outline of his career, that the heavenly constellations at any
given moment control earthly events and human acts, and that therefore a
study of the heavens can disclose the future. Both their tradition and
the example of their neighbors inclined medieval Jews to acknowledge
such doctrines as axiomatic. But the tenets of Judaism obliged them to
subjoin an important qualification: the stars determine human actions,
but they too are creatures of God, established by Him to perform this
special function, and therefore the influence they exert is subject to
His will. Repentance, prayer, piety, charity, good deeds—the religious
virtues—are the instruments by means of which man can induce God to
alter His decrees, and consequently to modify the fate that is "written
in the stars" for him. This is the purport of a mass of medieval Jewish
discussion of the subject; once granted, there was no check upon the
utilization of astrology for divinatory ends. Several writers expressly
excluded this science from the forbidden category of "magic," and
practically all German-Jewish writers tacitly or openly admitted its aid
in guiding man's footsteps.[2](jms37.htm#an_16_2.md)

The close association that was posited between the angels and the
heavenly bodies also served to foster this divinatory science. The seven
archangels, in particular, were believed to play an important part in
the universal order through their association with the planets and the
constellations. There is some variation, in the different versions, in
the angels assigned to the planets, and even the names of these angels
are subject to sudden change on a single page. The five lists I have
collated[3](jms37.htm#an_16_3.md) (containing some variant readings and
some

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

omissions) give the following result. The numerals represent the number
of times a name appears on these lists.

<div align="center">

|         |                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sun     | Raphael (4), Michael (2)                                        |
| Moon    | Gabriel (4), Aniel (or Anael) (1)                               |
| Venus   | Aniel (4), Ḥasdiel (1)                                          |
| Mercury | Michael (2), Ẓadkiel (1), Barkiel (1), Ḥasdiel (1), Raphael (1) |
| Saturn  | Kafẓiel (3), Michael (1)                                        |
| Jupiter | Ẓadkiel (4), Barkiel (1)                                        |
| Mars    | Samael (4), Gabriel (1)                                         |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I might have
included additional lists, but they would only have raised the numerals
without altering the preponderance of votes for the angels in the first
column. It is interesting to compare with these results a set of these
associations which entered medieval Christian thought by way of the
Moslem philosopher Averroes: the Sun and Michael, the Moon and Gabriel,
Venus and Anael, Mercury and Raphael, Saturn and Cassiel (Kafẓiel),
Jupiter and Sachiel (Ẓadkiel), Mars and Samael. This conception probably
derived from the Gnostic mysticism of the beginning of our era, which in
its turn was unquestionably influenced by such ancient notions as the
Babylonian seven planetary spirits, and the seven Amshaspands of Persia.

Some of the archangels also found themselves bound up with the twelve
signs of the Zodiac and consequently with the months, with new ones
invented or borrowed from ancient sources to make up the required
number. Here, too, there is no permanency about the association; an
angel may be divorced from his stellar charge without notice, and
another substituted. The following is a fair sample of these alliances:
Aries-Michael, Taurus-Gabriel, Gemini-Raphael, Cancer-Uriel, Leo-Guriel,
Virgo-Nuriel, Libra-Yeshamiel, Sagittarius-Ayil, Capricornus-Ubaviel,
etc.[4](jms37.htm#an_16_4.md) It must be remembered, also, that these names
change according to the season of the year, so that there are four
shifts supervising the heavenly bodies.

The usual primitive interpretation of eclipses and comets as portents of
disaster is encountered. Eclipses of the moon were taken to be
especially ominous for the Jewish people. Eclipses of the sun which
occurred on October 26, 1147, and September 4, 1187, threw German Jewry
into consternation; later it was learned that on these days the

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> German Crusaders
had suffered serious reverses in Palestine. In 1456 there occurred one
of the periodical appearances of Halley's comet which was noticed by
almost all the Christian chroniclers of the time, and was variously
interpreted as an omen of great earthquakes, of pestilence (both of
which visited Southern Italy in that year), etc. Not to be outdone,
Israel Isserlein, in Wiener-Neustadt, mounted a tower which stood in
"the street of the Jews" and examined the comet at close range, and then
portentously announced, "Its tail points toward Vienna!" "In the same
year," comments his biographer, "the 'King of Vienna' \[Ladislaus VI
Posthumous\], whose father had initiated anti-Jewish persecutions, was
poisoned in Prague \[by George of Podiebrad\], and the Hungarian king
\[Ladislaus Corvinus\] was murdered in his
capital."[5](jms37.htm#an_16_5.md)

The idea that the planets and the fixed stars rule over the affairs of
the material world was an ancient dogma which had received the sanction
of the foremost astronomer recognized in the Middle Ages, Ptolemy. The
influence of his exposition had made itself felt in Jewish thought even
before his *Tetrabiblos* reached Western Europe in Latin translation
during the twelfth century. Eleazar of Worms, who could not have been
directly acquainted with the astronomer's work, advanced his explanation
that the properties and powers of the heavenly bodies were consequent
upon their composition out of one or more of the four elements, earth,
air, fire, water, and their possession of one or more of the four
elemental properties, hot, cold, dry and moist. But these theoretical
considerations were of secondary import; the human utility of astrology
occupied the major part of Jewish interest and attention. The planets
and the stars were studied with an eye to their expediency in various
divinatory exercises: genethlialogy, or the casting of nativities or
horoscopes; elections, or the selection of favorable hours for beginning
contemplated enterprises; and the so-called judicial astrology,
obtaining answers to specific questions. To these ends tables were set
up delineating the fields of influence of the heavenly bodies. Saturn
governed poverty, wounds, illness, death; Jupiter, life, peace, joy,
wealth, honor, sovereignty; Mars, blood, the sword, evil, war, enmity,
envy, destruction; Venus, grace, beauty, passion, conception, fertility;
Mercury, wisdom, intelligence, learning, trades and occupations; the
sun, daily activities, and sovereignty; the moon, growth and decay, good
and evil. Then there were more detailed tables, giving the planets and

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

stars which rule each hour of the day and night and the nativities and
elections of these hours, on this order:

Second \[i.e., Sunday\] night

<div align="center">

|     |      |         |                                                                                                                 |
|-----|------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st | hour | Jupiter | propitious for setting out on a journey or taking a bride; one born in this hour will be handsome and wise;     |
| 2nd | hour | Mars    | do not approach a woman, and do not engage in trade; nativity—one will be poor, or will die in infancy;         |
| 3rd | hour | Sun     | propitious for every enterprise; nativity—one will be poor, will suffer misfortunes, and will die by the sword; |
| 4th | hour | Venus   | good for trade and marriage; nativity—one will be a conspirator and will be killed;                             |

</div>

and so on through the week. Nativities were also taken according to the
day of the week. While this was not strictly approved astrological
method, the Latin names of the days, paronyms of the planets, led to the
days being credited with the virtues of the stars. Jews never adopted
the week-day names in use in Europe, but for astrological purposes they
accepted the planetary associations. (One writer, for instance,
suggested that Friday was the favorite wedding day because it was
Venus's day.) The length of one's life could be similarly forecast. If
birth occurs in the "house" of Saturn (the heaven was divided into
twelve "houses," each presided over by a planet) the child will enjoy 57
years on earth; if in Jupiter's "house," 79; in Mars's, 66; Venus's 22;
the sun's, 77; etc.[6](jms37.htm#an_16_6.md)

There was also great interest in astrological weather prediction, and
many treatises were written on the subject. We have no extended Jewish
discussion, but ample evidence to indicate that Jews were familiar with
the method and were not averse to utilizing it. Predictions were based
on observations of the sun and its relation to the constellations, on
the phases of the moon, and on the physical appearance of these two
bodies, the color and shape of the clouds, unusual astronomical
phenomena, etc.

Certain periods were also chosen as symptomatic of the weather for the
entire year. Each of the four days between *Yom Kippur* and *Sukkot* was
equated with three months, so that if it rained on the

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

first of these days, one could anticipate heavy showers in the months of
Tishri, Ḥeshvan and Kislev. The days near the summer and winter
solstices were similarly regarded as portentous; the 13th of Tamuz
indicates the weather that will prevail during Tamuz, Ab, Elul and
Tishri, the 14th corresponds to Ḥeshvan, Kislev, Tebet, Shebat, etc. A
late tradition ascribed to Judah the Pious, which is probably authentic
since it tallies with a remark in a thirteenth-century work, displays a
more direct economic concern with the weather: when it rains on the 19th
of Tamuz and not on the 21st, the price of foodstuffs will be high until
the spring, and then will fall; if it rains on the 21st and not on the
19th, prices will be low until spring and will then rise; if it rains on
both days, prices will be high all year; but if it rains on neither day,
food will be abundant and cheap throughout the year. A common method of
predicting weather, among Christians, was on the basis of the twelve
days following Christmas (the season of the winter solstice) . Jews
adopted this practice, eliminating, of course, the reference to
Christmas; one month of the year was assigned to each day from the first
to the twelfth of Tebet (corresponding to the "Twelve Nights") and the
daily weather during this period was accepted as indicative of the
weather during the correlated months.[7](jms37.htm#an_16_7.md)

Lists of unlucky days, sometimes called "Egyptian Days," are of rather
common occurrence in medieval Latin works. Undoubtedly a relic of the
ill-omened days in the ancient Egyptian calendar, they were largely
determined on astrological grounds. These were preeminently days on
which patients should not be bled; in some cases the warning was
extended to cover any work of importance. Such lists based on tradition
and astrology are to be found in medieval Jewish literature as well.
Phlebotomy was regarded as a very dangerous operation when performed on
the eve of a holiday, or on *Hoshana Rabbah;* some included the entire
months of Tamuz, Ab, Elul and Shebat in the list, others only the first
day of Iyar, Elul and Tebet when these fall on a Monday or Wednesday,
and still others included the first of every month, and the period
between Passover and *Lag B’omer*.

Certain days of the week were also singled out as unfavorable: Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday; Sunday, Wednesday and Friday were regarded as
especially opportune for blood-letting. However, if Wednesday fell on a
4th, 14th, 24th, or during the last four days of the month, it was also
included among the inauspicious days. Monday and Wednesday were regarded
as unlucky for new undertakings,

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

and it was an accepted rule that "one does not begin anything on Monday
or Wednesday"; the explanation that "on these days the stars are
unpropitious" is no doubt the correct one. As Mordecai Jaffe, who
offered this reason, continued, "One should not inquire concerning the
astrological portents before beginning an undertaking, but when he knows
that the stars are unfavorable he should not act counter to them and
rely on a miracle." Eleazar of Worms published a list of 59 days through
the year when it was "good to set out on a
journey."[8](jms37.htm#an_16_8.md) The astrological factor was also of
great importance in magical pursuits. As we have seen, special days were
designated as particularly favorable for writing amulets and *mezuzot*.
Besides, the association of the angels with the planets and stars made
it necessary, before invoking angels, to determine just which
astrological influences were dominant. Magic leaned heavily upon
astrology.

According to some, the Roman superstition which forbade marriages in May
was preserved in the Jewish custom not to celebrate a wedding between
Passover and Pentecost, with an exception allowed on *Lag B’omer*. This
prohibition was judaized into a mark of mourning, and was associated
with the tradition that during this period, in the second century, a
great many of Akiba's pupils were destroyed by a plague. A
thirteenth-century manuscript, *Sefer Asufot*, explains it on the ground
that during these months the Jewish communities of the Rhineland were
decimated by marauding Crusaders, but the custom was introduced into
Judaism long before; it is first mentioned in a Geonic responsum of the
eighth or ninth century. As we noticed above, this period was also
considered inopportune for blood-letting. The mourning motif was
emphasized by further prohibitions against cutting the hair, paring
finger-nails, wearing new clothes and working after
sunset.[9](jms37.htm#an_16_9.md)

The moon is universally believed to exert a most powerful influence upon
terrestrial phenomena, and during the Middle Ages Christians and Jews
rarely entered upon an important activity without having first observed
the lunar auspices. The waxing moon advances growth and development, the
waning moon promotes decay and death. Eleazar of Worms diagnosed a
mental ailment as due to the contraction of the brain during the last
quarters of the moon, and its expansion during the first. Again he
warned that clothing soaked in water, trees that have been cut down,
fruits and grains harvested while the moon is diminishing rot away very
rapidly. Marriages were celebrated during a waxing moon, "not for any
superstitious reason,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

but only as a good omen"! A conception that occurred during this phase
of the moon was considered especially auspicious for the child; people
moved into new homes in the first half of the lunar month. The day of
the new moon was the most favorable for new enterprises, children were
brought to school and courses of study begun on that day. A rational
explanation of this last usage was offered, namely, "to give out-of-town
students time to arrive," but even its author realized that it was not
very convincing, and admitted "and also because it is a good omen."
Cutting the hair or finger-nails on new moon day was frowned upon
"because of the danger," for growth should not be checked on the day
which is most auspicious for it. Such beliefs were very prevalent among
German Christians, and though the rabbis often forbade these practices,
their disapproval had little effect on their
flock.[10](jms37.htm#an_16_10.md)

The pagan veneration of the new moon, which had by no means disappeared
in Biblical times, has no direct connection with the ceremony of
blessing the new moon which was outlined in the Talmud and is observed
to this day. But certain superstitious practices have been associated
with the rite, pointing to its continued occult importance in human
affairs. Some of these are first mentioned in a work composed during the
post-Talmudic period, the *Masechet Soferim*, others are medieval
accretions. In the first group are the practices of skipping three times
at the close of the blessing, and addressing the moon three times: "As I
skip before you and do not reach you, so, if others jump before me may
they not strike me," and of then thrice bidding one's neighbor "Peace be
unto you." The ceremony, as well as the threefold repetitions, are
typical of magical acts. In the latter group are the practice of shaking
one's clothes "to cast off the spirits," and the belief that one who has
performed the full rite need not fear death during the ensuing month. In
the sixteenth century the Safed school of Kabbalists instituted the
custom of fasting on the eve of the new moon (the day of the new moon
was a feast day). The practice was probably in vogue at an earlier time
and may be connected with a Christian usage, deplored by a
fifteenth-century German writer, but observed by "many people both laity
and clergy, even including masters," who "bend the knee or bow the head
at new moon or fast on that day, even though it be Sunday or Christmas
when the church forbids fasting." A halting recognition that the fast
was observed because of "the shrinking of the moon" is evidence of the
persistence of primitive apprehensions.[11](jms37.htm#an_16_11.md)

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

An interesting and obscure superstition attached to the four *Tekufot*,
or "turnings of the sun," that is, the solstices and equinoxes. It was
believed that during these periods a mysterious precipitation poisoned
all water, which should therefore not be drawn or drunk at the crucial
moment. The source of this Jewish superstition is very much in the dark.
The solstices in particular, when the day attains its longest and
shortest duration, have captured the imagination of primitive folk, and
have induced sentiments of exaltation and despair. It was believed that
at these times peculiarly potent supernatural forces are at work. During
the Middle Ages, among the non-Jewish peoples of Europe, the advent of
Midsummer Day was greeted with great festivities and bonfires, which,
among other things, were supposed to drive off certain noxious dragons
which polluted the wells and springs by dropping their seed into them as
they copulated in the upper atmosphere.

It has been suggested that this late belief was derived from the Jewish
superstition, which was first mentioned as far back as the tenth
century; Grünbaum's contention that the Jews borrowed it from the
Germans is certainly untenable. Hai Gaon, asked to explain the custom of
not drinking water during the *Tekufot*, replied, "Although we do not
know the reason, it should be meticulously observed, for not without
good reason has it spread through Israel." Apparently it was already, in
the tenth century, sanctioned by long usage. Then he proceeded to offer
the prevailing explanation, to the effect that during the four quarters
of the year the universe is guarded by specially appointed angels, but
at the *Tekufot*, the time of the changing of the watch, when their
supervision is momentarily relaxed, the powers of evil seize the
opportunity to work havoc among men by poisoning their wells. Hai Gaon
also suggested a rationalistic interpretation: the custom is an
expression of man's dislike to begin a new season with so
inconsequential an action as drinking water. This latter explanation was
occasionally repeated during the Middle Ages, but without enthusiasm;
the former was more often advanced as the true
reason.[12](jms37.htm#an_16_12.md)

A slight variant of this superstition is incorporated in the idea that
it is blood, rather than poison, that pollutes the wells. An old legend,
which made its first literary appearance in the *Maḥzor Vitry* (twelfth
century), connects this belief with the following events: God turned the
waters of Egypt into blood in the vernal equinox, and from then on at
the time of the equinox a drop of blood is deposited in the waters and
makes them unfit to drink; the same occurs at the summer solstice,

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

when Moses smote the rock and blood flowed therefrom; at the autumnal
equinox, when Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac, and blood appeared on
his knife; and at the winter solstice, when Jephtha sacrificed his
daughter in fulfillment of his vow. A Kabbalistic explanation has it
that Lilit's menses are the source of these drops of blood. Still
another legend is that the constellations Scorpio and Leo, or Cancer and
Libra, engage in a bitter struggle at these four critical moments, and
their blood taints our water. It is possible that there is some relation
between this blood version of the *Tekufah* superstition and the
medieval German belief that on Midsummer Day (St. John's Day) drops from
the bleeding corpse of John the Baptist, which at that time hovers over
the earth, are to be discerned on the leaves of the *Johanniskraut*
(*Hypericum perforatum*).[13](jms37.htm#an_16_13.md)

Despite the reproof administered by Judah the Pious, and often repeated,
that "the sincerely devout need fear no evil," there was a widespread
indisposition to make use of water drawn during the *Tekufah*, or which
had been left uncovered at that time. Maharil wrote that though he did
not dispute Judah's dictum, "it is best not to count on miracles"!
According to some, the danger was restricted to drinking water at the
instant of the *Tekufah*, and did not apply within a city, but most
people chose to play safe and accepted the broader view. Since the evil
spirits were generally held responsible, it was possible to adopt
certain preventive measures, which were first mentioned in Western
Germany in the thirteenth century, and from there spread throughout the
Jewish communities of Europe. These entailed the suspension of a piece
of iron in the water, or the admixture of some salt, or the sealing of
the vessel, all well-known anti-demonic devices. Thus ensured against
contamination, the water could be imbibed without fear or
danger.[14](jms37.htm#an_16_14.md)

The notion that death would befall anyone who killed a goose during an
undetermined brief period in the months of Tebet and Shebat (from about
the middle of December to the middle of February) produced a general
disinclination to slaughter geese throughout the two months. Some
believed that it was possible to evade this consequence by eating
immediately a bit of the dead fowl. The origin of this notion is
obscure. There may be something to the opinion of a late commentator
that it is based upon the belief that "the demons are at the height of
their power in these months" (the period of the winter solstice) and for
some reason resent the slaughter of a goose.[15](jms37.htm#an_16_15.md)

As a final note to this chapter it should be pointed out that medieval

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

medicine, Christian and Jewish, was strongly influenced by astrological
considerations. The planets and stars were responsible for the
functioning not alone of the universe, but of the human body as well; an
exact and minute correspondence was drawn between the various heavenly
bodies and the human organs. Even the foods that man consumes were
related to the stars, and drew their peculiar natural and occult
qualities from them. Therefore illnesses were often caused by
astrological influences—we have seen how the waning and waxing of the
moon can affect a man's mind (a non-Jewish surgeon advised against
operating on a fractured skull at the full of the moon, because then the
brain expands and fills the cranium)—and medical treatments took these
factors into account.[16](jms37.htm#an_16_16.md)
