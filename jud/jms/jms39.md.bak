### BIBLIOGRAPHY

#### A.—A NOTE ABOUT THE SOURCES

Although this book is concerned primarily with the Jewish Middle Ages
(c. 1000-1600), <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) it has been necessary
to pay considerable attention to source material originating in earlier
periods, particularly to the Talmud. This encyclopedia of Jewish law,
customs and beliefs was accepted as the final word on all matters
appertaining to Judaism, and Jewish life was deliberately patterned
after its dicta. It would therefore be impossible to comprehend any
phase of medieval Jewish life without giving due weight to the influence
of the Talmud in shaping it.

The same is true, to a lesser degree, of the Geonic writings, especially
the responsa, which were frequently accepted as authoritative. Still
another type of material originating in the Geonic period is of
importance for us, namely, the mystical and magical literature and
inscriptions which have been edited by such scholars as Gaster,
Montgomery, and others. *The Sword of Moses* has a great deal in common
with the Aramaic incantation texts derived from magical bowls. This
material represents the transition between Talmudic and medieval magic
and superstition, and is extremely useful in tracing the process of
development. Incidentally, the interesting problem of how the
transference of the Greek-Egyptian magical tradition, the influence of
which this material clearly displays, occurred by way of Babylonia
rather than Palestine warrants investigation.

So far as the medieval sources themselves are concerned, it must be said
at the outset that very few indeed have any direct bearing upon our
subject. There is hardly any Jewish literature in the north of Europe
devoted specifically to magic. *Sefer Raziel*, probably compiled in the
thirteenth century and containing much Geonic mystical material (so
potent were its contents considered that mere possession of the book was
believed to prevent fires), and the anonymous *Shimmush Tehillim*, "The
(Magical) Use of the Psalms," were

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

all, besides some of the works of Eleazar of Worms and his school, such
as *Ḥochmat HaNefesh*, which contain more or less pertinent material. In
recent years several scholars, most notably Professor Max Grunwald of
Vienna, have published extracts from manuscript works dealing with this
subject, which lead one to believe that additional material of this
nature is hidden away in European libraries.

A good deal of information is disclosed by the popular works on ethics
and manners, of which the thirteenth-century *Sefer Ḥasidim*, attributed
to Judah the Pious, is the best and most fertile example. It is a
veritable mine of folklore and superstition. Other such books, as *Orḥot
Ẓadikim*, Moses b. Ḥanoch's *Brantspiegel*, the several versions of the
*Vrauen Büchlein*, etc., though less important, have proved informative.
Collections of legends and folk-tales (*e.g.*, Gaster's translation of
the *Ma’aseh Book*, and N. Brüll's collection in the *Jahrbücher*) also
reveal many beliefs and practices of the period.

Again, there are three works whose primary purpose is legalistic, but
which have a degree of personal orientation, so that it is possible to
glean from them much valuable information. These are Samson b. Ẓadok's
*Tashbeẓ*, the *Maharil*, and Joseph b. Moses’ *Leket Yosher*, which
attempt to present the opinions and decisions and practices, with much
personal comment, of three leading authorities, Meir b. Baruch of
Rothenburg, Jacob Mölln, and Israel Isserlein, respectively. The last
contains a great amount of personal and biographical material, and is
therefore the most interesting and most useful for our purpose.

Most of the literature, however, is legalistic or exegetical, attempting
to codify and interpret Jewish law and precepts. We may distinguish
among these: 1. the large number of codes and expositions of customs
(*Minhagim*), which contain many personal reminiscences and observations
on current usage (such works as Isaac b. Moses’ *Or Zarua*, Eliezer b.
Nathan's *Raben*, Moses b. Jacob's *Semag*, Eliezer b. Joel's *Rabiah*,
and Tyrnau's *Minhagim*, are outstanding in this respect); 2. works such
as Eleazar b. Judah's *Rokeaḥ*, and *HaḤayim*, by Ḥayim b. Beẓalel,
which combine ethical and legalistic subject-matter; 3. the commentaries
on Bible and Talmud (notably Rashi, the Tosafot, Isaac b. Judah's
*Pa‘aneaḥ Raza*, *Ẓiyuni*); 4. the glosses and notes on Codes, such as
Solomon Luria's *‘Amude Shlomo* on *Semag* and the very important
additions of Moses Isserles in the *Shulḥan ‘Aruch*, as well as Mordecai
Jaffe's notes thereto; 5. the codifications of matter pertaining
primarily to the ritual, such as

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Siddur Rashi* and
*Maḥzor Vitry*, the latter being especially useful; 6. and finally, the
vast responsa literature, containing rabbinic decisions and opinions
upon a great variety of disputes and queries relating to law, ritual,
custom, morals, etc.

These works contain a great deal of valuable information, though it is
far from a simple task to ferret it out. Naturally, the direct
references to contemporary conditions are most significant. But they
present also a perplexing problem, namely, to distinguish between mere
recapitulation of old legislation and tradition, and reporting of
contemporaneous practice. The mere fact that Talmudic prescription was
baldly quoted is no indication that it was still observed. It is
necessary, therefore, to weigh carefully internal evidence; these works,
after all, were composed primarily for public use, they were not mere
encyclopedic compendia. Therefore the fact that certain Talmudic
material is included, while other is omitted, that certain matters are
gone into in some detail, and others glossed over, that a degree of
freedom is evidenced in discarding time-worn practices with the
observation that they are no longer observed because of altered
circumstances, that disputes arise concerning proper observance and
occasional notes and anecdotes illustrate differences in observance of
old customs, all help us the better to evaluate what might otherwise
appear to be merely mechanical repetition of Talmudic injunctions. It
must be noted, moreover, that many of the superstitious practices
enumerated in Talmudic and Geonic literature are still observed today,
so that we may not doubt that reference to them in the Middle Ages
represents a true reflection of current observance.

There is little material of a more general nature which is of help, but
the anti-Maimonidean polemic of Moses Taku, *Ketab Tamim*, the
*Disputation of R. Jeḥiel*, and a few other works, contain interesting
information.

I have also used some material later in date than 1600, such as the
writings of the Horowitz family, the commentaries on the *Shulḥan
‘Aruch*, and Menasseh b. Israel's *Nishmat Ḥayim*, as well as a few
books emanating from Southern Europe (Solomon Almoli's *Pitron Ḥalomot*,
Levita's *Tishbi*, Ẓedekiah b. Abraham's *Shibbole HaLeket*, *Kol Bo*,
Menaḥem Recanati's works) because they reflect more or less directly
upon the period and region we are studying.

Unfortunately, none of the interesting pictorial material to be found in
periodicals and the encyclopedias can be definitely ascribed to our
period, and I have therefore refrained from using it.

The Bibliography of Hebrew Sources includes all the Hebrew source
material which has been utilized; the Bibliography of Modern Literature
contains only the material which is more or less directly relevant to
the study of medieval Jewish magic and superstition. Other literature
referred to in the notes is fully indicated there.
