### DIVINATION

#### DETERMINISM VS. FREE WILL

THE THORNY problem of free will, which has defeated greater philosophers
than German Jewry produced, came no nearer a solution than where the
rabbis of the Talmud had left it. The rabbinic authorities of Northern
Europe were not distinguished for their concern with metaphysics; the
problem interested them only in its more immediate and practical
aspects. Is man's life foreordained? Is there any point in trying to
live the good life? Do sincere repentance and piety affect the course of
a man's career? Is it possible to discover future events? These were the
questions that engaged their attention—and to all they resolutely
answered "yes." For rabbinic Judaism straddled the issue of free will by
positing a thoroughgoing determinism which, in some mysterious manner,
still left men free to exercise discretion. While the general course of
man's life is laid out for him at birth, the choice of good or evil
rests with him—thus ran the unfathomable enigma. But "theirs not to
reason why"; the solution had been advanced in Talmudic times and
medieval Jewry didn't pry into its mechanism. As one man put it in
astrological terms: the tenor of his life, which is conditioned by his
"general" star (*mazal hakelali*), can hardly be influenced by a man's
merit; his discrete acts, and the separate events of his life, which are
imposed upon him by "particular" stars (*mazal perati*), only slightly
more. Yet, "It lies within the power of each to do the good or the evil
deed, and no external compulsion or restraint is exerted upon him. . . .
To quote the rabbis, 'Everything is in the hand of God, except the fear
of God' \[*Ber*. 33b\]. If the quality of good or of evil were implanted
in his very nature, it would be as impossible to turn man from good to
evil, or from evil to good, as it is to alter the natural tendency of
matter to fall or of fire to rise." In other words, though a man's
activities are predetermined, he alone is responsible for their moral
complexion.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

The theological issue does not concern us here. What does is the
deterministic view of life which governed the masses. Granting the
credit value of good deeds and repentance on the celestial balance sheet
of a life, it was none the less the general view that "nothing ever
happens to a man except at God's command"; "He decrees who shall be a
scholar, and how much and for how long he shall study, and whether he
will compose one, or two, or three books" and "just how many steps he
will take in his lifetime, and how many men his eyes will
behold."[1](jms35.htm#an_14_1.md) Essentially this was a thorough fatalism,
though the rabbis were careful not to permit it to dominate the
religious view of life.

The corollary of this conception is obvious. What is already decreed in
Heaven ought in some way be ascertainable by man. The universe is one
close-meshed unit; heaven and earth, animals, plants, angels, demons,
man, all are creatures of God, manifestations of His will, all so
sensitively intertwined that each reacts immediately to the slightest
alteration in the composition of the whole. (This doctrine is summed up
in the elaborate comparisons between man and the world, between
microcosmos and macroanthropos, which are to be found in Talmudic and
medieval Jewish literature. Such treatises adduce parallels between the
human body and the universe in the most minute
detail.[2](jms35.htm#an_14_2).md) Events predetermined in the mind of God
impinge upon one or another aspect of His universe long before they
reach the final stage of occurrence on earth; the superior sensitivity
of certain parts of the world, and even of parts of man's immediate
environment and body, makes them responsive to what is yet to be long
before it is. Upon this theory is reared the great science of
divination—perhaps the most important single division, practically
speaking, of the magical technique. Man's task is to discover means of
recognizing and reading the signs which a generous nature spreads before
his eyes. And to this task, however the theory may have been phrased,
man has devoted himself from earliest days. One may venture to say that
human curiosity about the world and study of natural phenomena in the
long pre-scientific millennia were fostered as much by this one motive
as by any other. Even the elementary search for food and shelter did not
require and produce the detailed knowledge of our environment that the
search for the future did. Paradoxically, seeking to learn what will be,
man came to know what is. We need recall only the immense debt which our
knowledge of the heavens owes to the astrological interests of our

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

ancestors, or the anatomical studies pursued originally only for
divinational ends.

#### OMENS

The simplest and most direct means of discerning the future is through
the ability to interpret the natural omens which point it out. Most
often such interpretation indicates merely the advisability or
inadvisability of following a certain course; again, at times the world
about us has a more elaborate story to tell. The ancient literature of
the Jews shows their acquaintance with the art of reading omens—though
they were amateurs at it compared with other peoples, the Babylonians,
or the Romans, for example. The Talmud frowned upon the conscious and
deliberate practice of this art, but acknowledged that one could not
avoid heeding those signs that thrust their lessons under his nose.
"Although one may not deliberately divine by them \[that is, purpose in
advance to employ them for such ends\], a house, an infant and a woman
may be regarded as prognostics." This cryptic remark is amplified by the
commentators in the *Gemara:* if after one has erected a house, or
married a wife, or fathered a child, his affairs are successful or the
reverse on three separate occasions, he may consider these to be
portents of good or bad fortune. This passage was construed in later
times as granting *carte blanche* to pursue the art, and to expand
it.[3](jms35.htm#an_14_3.md)

During the Middle Ages, taking omens from bodily phenomena was a very
popular pastime among Christians and Jews. The following passages, from
thirteenth-century works, seem to have been lifted from non-Jewish
sources. One opens, "Just as the astrologers foresee events from the
stars, so there are some who can foretell the future from human signs.
If the flesh under one's armpit quivers, they will be broaching a match
to him soon, and if it is the flesh at his loins, his wife will be
unclean, or he will sleep alone; if his eyelids quiver, he will be
seeing corpses and graves, and if the skin of his neck, he will soon be
involved in a quarrel. Similarly every part of his body can presage
coming events." The department of "itches" was especially well
developed. "If the sole of one's foot itches . . . he will be journeying
soon to a strange place; . . . his ears, he will hear news; his eyelids,
he will behold a novel sight or read an unfamiliar book; his tongue, he
will speak of new things; his eyebrows, he will behold men or women whom
he has not seen in a long while;

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

his forehead, people are looking for him and want to see him; his palm,
he will hold in his hand gold or silver; his nose \[he will be angry\];
under his eyes and near his nose, he will weep. Itching in any part of
the body is an omen. . . . God apprises man, through bodily phenomena,
of what will transpire."[4](jms35.htm#an_14_4.md)

Sneezes also were regarded as in some degree portentous. According to
primitive views sneezing is the work of the spirits, and this is why,
the world over, a sneeze is met with the customary pious response
calling down the blessing of God on the sneezer. Jewish legend has it
that before the time of Jacob people died suddenly without any warning,
in the nature of illness, of their impending demise; they simply sneezed
and fell dead. The sneeze, then, was an omen of death; hence the
blessing which was intended to negate its prophecy. Various responses
have been used by Jews: "Health!" "God bless thee!" "God help thee!"
etc., while the one who sneezed quoted Gen. 49:18, "For Thy salvation I
wait, O Lord." The ominous nature of the sneeze is not mentioned in
medieval Jewish literature, beyond the recital of this legend, but the
masses were probably alive to it. Several writers repeated the contrary
Talmudic statement to the effect that sneezing during prayers is a good,
and letting wind, a bad sign.[5](jms35.htm#an_14_5.md)

Animals, too, were closely watched for signs of the future. The
disconsolate howling of a dog is a certain indication that the angel of
death is strolling through town. If a dog drags his rump along the floor
in the direction of the door, this too is a token of approaching death.
The starling shrills when it observes in the stars that a guest is about
to pay one a visit. Birds in general, ancient standby of the augur,
presage the future by their cries and the manner of their flight. One of
the medieval mystics has an interesting theory as to how they gain the
information which they thus pass on. It seems that there is a type of
spirit that flits about in the upper atmosphere listening in
surreptitiously on the conversations of the "princes of the stars," who
of course are aware of what is to transpire on earth, and indeed are
responsible for earthly events. These spirits gossip about what they
have overheard, and the birds, flying among them, pick up the bits of
information which they unwittingly disclose to men. The snail, or the
mole, which is noticed burrowing in a house and casting up the earth
behind, is proclaiming that an adulterous act is soon to be committed
there. The admonition that one should keep a rooster indoors to be
warned when God is angry

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

becomes clear when we connect it with the instruction to kill
immediately any goose or cock which upsets a dish or any other vessel.
This is a sign of bad luck which the death of the fowl may help to
avert. One of our authors grudgingly apprises us that "there are wise
men who can foretell the future by means of trees and herbs," and then
drops the subject without going into detail.[6](jms35.htm#an_14_6.md)

"No superstition," wrote Grimm, "struck deeper root throughout the
entire Middle Ages than those omens comprised under the terms *aneganc*,
*widerganc*, *widerlouf*. Every animal, human being or object which one
unexpectedly encountered the first thing in the morning, indicated good
or bad fortune, and admonished either the continuance or the abandonment
of the day's enterprise." The Talmud knew of this type of augury, but
its prohibition did not prevent the Jew from aping his neighbor. "If he
meets an ugly person, or cattle, or a beast, or a bird," scolds the
*Brantspiegel*, "or he hears a cross word, or a curse, he says, 'This is
a bad omen.'" (In certain German districts it was believed that if one
beholds a Jew in the morning it is a very unlucky sign, and if the Jew
peers through the window, the entire week will be ruined.) In the same
way, it was considered unlucky to begin a day, or a week, or a year with
an act that involved some loss, for it was feared that the succeeding
period would take its character from that act. If the tax-collector was
making his rounds, or a friend was so thoughtless as to try to collect
an old debt, they were put off until the next day. Why make bad enough
worse?[7](jms35.htm#an_14_7.md)

A bucolic environment and interest are displayed in the prediction of
weather from the omens. For instance, one list cites the following
phenomena as indications of protracted heavy rains: If the pigs or goats
are in rut and are unsated, if after they have wallowed in mud they
return for more, if the cattle in grazing bury their muzzles into the
earth, or stretch their necks toward the north, if the dogs paw holes in
the ground, if the cattle dip their lips into the water when they are
not thirsty, if spiders’ webs fall off of themselves when there is no
wind to blow them down—all these are certain signs of the coming
floods.[8](jms35.htm#an_14_8.md)

Among other such superstitions I may mention the following: A seminal
pollution on the Day of Atonement was generally believed to token death
within the year, though the Talmudic authorities differed as to its
interpretation. It was a widespread custom to enter upon a period of
fasting when a Pentateuch fell to the ground,

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

which was construed as an ill omen; as a sixteenth-century writer said,
"I haven't seen any support for this custom in any book, but 'I haven't
seen it' is no proof." If anyone who has performed a regular religious
duty for years, such as leading the prayers on a holiday, is unable to
do so one year, this may be taken as an indication that some disaster
will visit his household. An error in prayer also betokened misfortune.
An interesting belief in the Rhineland was to the effect that when the
flames on the hearth leap unusually high, a guest is about to arrive. If
one should douse the fire with water, the visitor will be drowned; "this
is true and irrefutable, for many men have tested it"! German Christians
also held this view, and the idea met with in medieval Lorraine, that by
covering the fire a girl could rid herself of a persistent suitor, is
explicable only on the basis of the same
conception.[9](jms35.htm#an_14_9.md)

Foodstuffs were on occasion regarded as tokens of good fortune. If eggs
were not to be eaten on Saturday evening, the beginning of the week,
because they were associated in folklore and custom with mourning, the
New Year dinner included a variety of foods that were suggestive of
prosperity and happiness: the head of a lamb, "that He may put us at the
head and not at the tail-end" of things, fat meats, and sweets such as
apples dipped in honey, "that the new year may be prosperous and happy,"
pomegranates, "that our merits may be as numerous as its seeds," fish,
which are proverbially symbols of fruitfulness, and others. A fish
called *Barben* (the barbel, *Barbus vulgaris*) was served "because its
name suggests 'mercy'" (in *mhd*. the *Barbe* was called *barm*, which
could be interpreted as a form of *erbarmen*, "to be merciful") . Still
other suggestive foods were excluded from this meal; most notable, as an
indication of the extreme tenuousness of some of these associations, was
the avoidance of nuts, because *egoz* (nut) is arithmetically equivalent
to *ḥet* (sin). In some communities it was customary to set the table
for this meal completely with new linens and utensils, "as a good
omen."[9a](jms35.htm#an_14_9a.md)

The portents which were read out of, or into, the accidents of life,
were no doubt vastly more numerous than the literature discloses. Every
individual could, and probably did, have his private stock of
superstitions, in addition to those that were generally accepted. There
were some who were better trained in this science than others, and these
set up as experts. The degree of skill that was attainable is disclosed
by the statement that "there is a science by which a man, by looking at
a cut of meat, can tell whether the

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

butcher had intercourse the night before"![10](jms35.htm#an_14_10.md) This
may not be foretelling the future, which is, after all, not so difficult
if the alibis are prepared in advance, but it does involve a much rarer
skill, discovering what happened last night, which, as any historian can
testify, is no easy job.

#### THE PROGNOSTIC ARTS

A passive interpretation of omens did not satisfy the lust for
knowledge. The quest proceeded to an active creation of signs and
portents. In common with the foremost non-Jewish thinkers, religious and
lay, the rabbis were forced into the difficult position of forbidding on
moral and religious grounds practices whose efficacy they could not
deny. Try as the Church and Synagogue did to stamp out what they
regarded as a vice, their more or less open admission that this "vice"
could bring results served to advertise its usefulness to the masses.
Whether deriving from the Jewish background, which had had occasion to
assimilate much from the Oriental and the Græco-Roman cultures, or from
its Christian contemporaries, medieval Jewry was acquainted with and
employed a wide variety of the methods of divination commonly resorted
to everywhere. The Germans, in particular, were devoted to this
science—divination had been a prominent feature of the ancient Teutonic
religion and maintained its popularity in Christian times—and the Jews
who inhabited the Germanic lands were strongly subjected to this
influence."

Some of the forms of divination involved merely the application of a
superstitious principle, with no additional magical apparatus. One such
was to set a lighted candle in a place where there was no draught to
extinguish it, during the ten days between *Rosh Hashanah* and *Yom
Kippur*. If the light went out, it signified that the individual would
not live through the year; if it burned down to the end, it meant he
could count on one more year of life, at the least. These ten days are
traditionally accepted as the period during which the fate of each man
is determined in heaven. Light is universally regarded as a symbol of
life. The association is logical and obvious, if we accept the
premises.[12](jms35.htm#an_14_12.md)

Even more intimately bound up with the human being than light is man's
shadow, which among primitive peoples is regarded as a part of the body,
or a projection from it. We are acquainted with

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

the belief that one may harm an individual by treading on, or striking,
or stabbing his shadow. On the night of *Hoshana Rabbah*, the seventh
day of the Feast of Tabernacles, when it was believed that the decision
concerning men's fate during the new year, which had been reached by
*Yom Kippur*, was finally and irrevocably indited in the celestial book
of records, the practice became widespread among medieval Jews to go out
into the moonlight and observe whether the shadows they cast were by
some ill chance devoid of heads. The lack of a head was an unmistakable
sign that the decree which had already been executed upon the shadow
would before long be visited on the body. The colophon of a
sixteenth-century manuscript contains these words by the scribe: "On the
night of *Hoshana Rabbah*, 5315 A.M. \[1556 C.E.\] I saw the shadow of
my head in the moonlight; praised be God, for now I am assured that I
shall not die this year." This belief was and is to be found throughout
the Christian communities of Northern and Eastern Europe, the particular
seasons at which it is observed being, of course, derived from the
Christian calendar: Christmas eve, New Year's eve, Epiphany, etc. The
earliest Jewish reference to it with which I am acquainted is by Eleazar
of Worms; a short time later we find it mentioned by the famous Spanish
commentator and philosopher, Naḥmanides. I should add that the Jewish
basis for this custom was adduced from a rendering of Nu. 14:9 which
gave the sense "their shadow is removed from them" to words which are
usually otherwise translated. This custom was repeatedly mentioned by
later German-Jewish writers.[13](jms35.htm#an_14_13.md)

A related belief was that the reflection of a man who is doomed to die
will show him with his eyes and mouth closed, even though he has them
wide open. According to our sources (Eleazar of Worms, again, is the
first to speak of it), on a certain night of the year the Gentiles would
peer into a basin of water with eyes and mouth gaping wide, to discover
their fate. In time, we learn, this practice (oil occasionally being
used instead of water) was transferred by Jews to the night of *Hoshana
Rabbah*, though some observed it on *Yom
Kippur*.[14](jms35.htm#an_14_14.md)

Of a similar nature was the belief that if one saw his image with a halo
encircling his head, this too was a token of imminent death; when God
has finished His daily stint of signing decrees, runs the explanation,
He wipes His pen on the hair of a worthy man, whom He is about to take
unto Himself, and thus is bestowed upon him

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

the nimbus which his reflection boasts. This was the Midrashic
explanation of the "beams of light" that emanated from Moses’ head, and
in the Middle Ages, it seems, God still clung to His ancient ways. It
is, further, "well known in medicine" that when a man has been bitten by
any virulent animal, such as a mad dog, "if he beholds the image of the
dog when he looks into water, the bite will be
fatal."[15](jms35.htm#an_14_15.md)

The familiar use of Scripture in divining (Bibliomancy) was not unknown
to Jews. The Romans had thus employed Vergil; the Bible was already put
to this use by Christians before the eighth century; in medieval Germany
hymn- and prayer-books served the same purpose. But Jews did not have to
borrow this device from their neighbors. In Talmudic times it was a
common practice to ask children what verses they had studied that day in
school, and to accept them as good or bad omens, an expedient that
persisted throughout the Middle Ages. The more usual procedure of
opening the Bible at random and taking the first word or sentence that
strikes the eye as a portent, was also followed. Similarly, "if, upon
awakening, one recalls a Biblical verse, this is to be regarded as a
'minor prophecy,' and if it is an ominous passage, one should
fast."[19](jms35.htm#an_14_19.md)

These methods required no special skill and could be readily applied by
anyone. Many of the more highly reputed techniques, however, were not
available to the uninitiated. Among these were the rather technical
skills of Anthroposcopy (divining by the features) and Chiromancy (by
the hand), still as widely pursued today as ever. During the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries works on these subjects were very popular in
Christian circles. I know of no extended discussion of them in Jewish
literature, but they were undoubtedly familiar to Jews. The *Zohar*
distinguished four primary facial types, corresponding to the creatures
which appeared in Ezekiel's vision: the man, the lion, the ox, and the
eagle. The formation of the head thus indicates the character and temper
of the man, for "Physiognomy does not consist in the external
lineaments, but in the features which are mysteriously drawn within us.
The features of the face change according to the form which is peculiar
to the inward face of the spirit." Physiognomy was employed not only to
distinguish the true character of a man, but also to prognosticate his
action in the future. The art of interpreting the lines which appear in
the soles and palms, and on the forehead (Metoposcopy), more properly
divinatory, is mentioned in Geonic literature and crops

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

up occasionally in the medieval period. One writer went so far as to
explain the rite of examining the finger-nails by the light of the
*Habdalah* candle on this ground: "We are accustomed to study our hands
in the light because the wise man can read in them our fate and the good
fortune which is about to befall us."[17](jms35.htm#an_14_17.md)

Casting lots (Sortilege) was a common divinatory practice during the
Middle Ages. Though such simple devices as tossing a coin, throwing
dice, etc., were employed, the procedure even in these cases was
complicated by rules specifying when the operation might be performed,
and just how the lot was to be held, and how to interpret the results,
as well as by the recitation of prescribed prayers or charms. A form of
lot which the Jews learned from "Esclavonia" utilized a piece of wood
from which the bark had been peeled on one side; the smooth side was
denominated the "woman," the rough, the "man." It was tossed into the
air twice. If the "man" fell uppermost the first time, followed by the
"woman," this was a good portent; the reverse betokened ill luck, and
two of a kind was taken to be non-committal. There were also Hebrew
"Books of Lots" which, like their Christian counterparts, were of
Arabian origin; the Jewish versions appear to have been composed mainly
in Southern Europe and in the Orient. They were probably used in the
North as well, but there is no such work which can definitely be traced
to Northern Europe. These works comprised sets of rules for finding
answers to specified questions by means of the twelve signs of the
Zodiac, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet, the names of the twelve
tribes, animals, birds, cosmic phenomena, etc.[18](jms35.htm#an_14_18.md)

A man's name, the matrix of his character and personality, was also
useful in deciphering his fate (Onomancy). One method, employed to
determine which of two competitors would triumph, was to calculate the
numerical values of their names, and divide them by nine. If the two
were of the same type, that is, both were Jews, followed the same trade
or profession, possessed the same degree of learning, etc., the one
whose name after the operation left the larger balance, was the
superior. If they were dissimilar in type, then the smaller balance
denoted the successful one.[19](jms35.htm#an_14_19.md)

Geomancy, which, Thorndike says, "seems to have been nearly as popular
in the medieval period as the ouija board is now" (or was in 1923, when
he wrote these words), was well known to Jews as well as Christians.
Thorndike describes it as "a method of divination in which, by marking
down a number of points at random

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

and then connecting or cancelling them by lines, a number or figure is
obtained which is used as a key to sets of tables or to astrological
constellations. The only reason for calling this geomancy, that is,
divination by means of the element earth, would seem to be that at first
the marks were made and figures drawn in the sand or dust. . . . But by
the Middle Ages, at least, any kind of writing material would do as
well." Our sources tell us of "diviners who use sand and stones," and
one refers more specifically to those who "make dots on paper or in
sand." The reference is unmistakably to practitioners of
geomancy.[20](jms35.htm#an_14_20.md)

These instances involved not merely the divinatory process itself, but
also certain magical acts to which was attributed in the end the success
of the venture. Tossing a coin or dice, after all, has significance only
if some supernatural power who knows the future is directing their fall.
The operation of the magic is manifest in these prescriptions: To
discover the identity of a thief, one should knead little balls of clay,
write the name of a suspect on each, and drop them into a pot of water.
Then Psalm 16 is to be recited a number of times, along with its
mystical names, and the command, "Disclose to me the man who stole these
objects." We are solemnly assured that the ball bearing the right name
will promptly rise to the surface. A variation is to write the names
upon stones, heat them in a fire, and then drop them into a hole in the
ground. This, of course, is to be accompanied by the appropriate charms.
The stone that is marked with the thief's name will be the first to
steam. The same device was employed to find the answers to other
problems. A fifteenth-century manuscript gives this version: write "yes"
on one leaf and "no" on another, roll two pills out of virgin earth and
place the leaves in them (or the pills may contain several possible
replies to a given question) . Draw some water secretly from a spring,
pour it into a bowl, slip the pills into it silently, and then say, "I
conjure you by the Lord, who created heaven and earth, to reveal to me
what is true, to conceal what is not true; I conjure you by the staff
with which Moses divided the sea"; etc. Conclude with Ps. 4, 12, 15, 31,
55. The pill which first breaks open and permits its leaf to float to
the top gives the answer to the question propounded. Still another, to
discover the month in which one is destined to die, requires that the
names of the angels who preside over the months be incised on twelve
golden discs, which are to be dropped into oil, over which the charm is
recited. The oil is then to be set out under the stars,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

in a new glass vessel, for seven nights, care being taken that at no
time during this period is it exposed to the rays of the sun. On the
seventh night, at midnight, the proper disc will rise to the surface.
The oil and the discs are to be preserved, for the former now possesses
miraculous healing powers, while the latter make potent amulets against
evil spirits and the evil eye. These receipts indicate clearly the
intimate connection between magic and
divination.[21](jms35.htm#an_14_21.md)

Other methods, equally well known in Christian Europe, were to interpret
the shapes assumed by drops of oil or melted wax floating on the surface
of a basin of water, and to suspend a ring of pure gold over a goblet of
water and divine by the sounds it makes as it strikes against the sides
of the goblet (departments of Hydromancy) . Plants were also utilized
(Botanomancy): "On Monday evening, after sunset, go into a field and
find the yellow, broad-leaved mallow, face the east and dig a hole
there, bow, encircle the spot once, bow again toward the east," and
recite a charm which concludes, "If my venture is to prove successful,
then you must remain in bloom; if not, then must you droop to the
earth." Return in the morning and learn how your undertaking will turn
out.[22](jms35.htm#an_14_22.md)

#### THE DIVINING PRINCES

The most prevalent form of divination practiced by Jews, if we may judge
from the frequency with which it is mentioned—it is often cited as the
type of the magical act—was well known in oriental and classical
antiquity, and was frequently resorted to by medieval Christians. It was
carried out with the aid of a polished or reflective surface—crystal,
finger-nail, wax, sword, arrow- or spearhead, mirror, water, the palm of
the hand smeared with soot and oil, all of these, and more were
used—into which an innocent child was made to gaze fixedly until he
beheld the figures that disclosed the desired information. John of
Salisbury, who died in 1181, writes of his own experience as a boy, when
his instructor, a priest, after performing various adjurations and
sorceries, had him and a companion look into polished basins or
finger-nails smeared with holy oil or chrism and report what they saw.
The other boy saw some ghostly shapes but John thanks God that he saw
nothing and so was not employed henceforth in this manner. He adds that
he has known many *specularii* and that they have all suffered loss of
sight

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

or some other evil. Even the holy patens "daruf man Got in der mess
handelt and wandelt" were used by unscrupulous priests for this
purpose.[23](jms35.htm#an_14_23.md)

This technique was known to Jews in Talmudic times: "It is permitted to
enquire of the 'princes of oil' and the 'princes of eggs,' but \[one
does not do so because\] they lie." It may even be that Joseph's
divining cup (Gen. 44:5) was similarly employed.[24](jms35.htm#an_14_24.md)
During the Middle Ages the Talmudic terminology was retained, and we
read of "princes" of glass, the thumb-nail, etc. The "princes" were the
figures that appeared upon the polished surfaces, and though "they lie"
medieval Jews were nothing loath to take their chances on what they
might reveal.

The procedure seems to have been fairly well fixed. Several medieval
German accounts parallel closely the following instructions from a
fifteenth-century manuscript:

"First take some flax and make a candle wick out of it; then roll the
candle, a span or more in length, from virgin wax. With a finger-nail
incise seven rings around the candle and set it on the ground. Draw
seven circles around it with a sword, and seat yourself in the center,
with the boy on your lap. The lad should not be older than nine years,
and should be short. This operation should be performed on a Saturday or
Monday or Thursday night. The boy grasps the candle in his hand, and you
say into his right ear, 'Adam Ḥavah Abton Absalom Sarfiel Nuriel
Daniel,' and say nine times, '*Gerte*, I conjure you with these seven
names which I have mentioned, to appear in the wax of this candle,
carefully prepared and designated for this purpose, and to answer me
truthfully concerning that which I shall question you.' Then ask the
boy, 'What do you see?' If he says, 'I see a woman' and if she is
dressed in black, order the boy to command her, at his master's wish, to
be clothed in white and to jump and dance. As soon as the boy sees her
he is to say, 'Thy coming be in peace,' and after the jumping, '*Gerte*,
I conjure you in the name of my master, that you show me the
hiding-place of the property stolen from N son of N and where it may now
be found, and that you show it to me in such a way that I may recognize
it.' And if he doesn't recognize it, then the boy is to direct the
woman, in his master's name, to write the location of this place
clearly, in large letters and with the vowel points, so that the boy may
be able to read it. Don't be dismayed and confused if you try this
procedure two or three times and she doesn't appear; she may

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

be asleep. When she departs the boy should say to her, 'Go in peace, and
come again when my master wishes.'"[25](jms35.htm#an_14_25.md)

The details differed for the various materials employed, but the general
outline of the performance was in all cases as it is here given. So
widespread was the use of this device that it was accepted as entirely
proper by pious Jews, and was permitted even on the Sabbath. A case is
recorded in which the plaintiff, evidently a professional diviner, sued
his client, who had appealed to him to discover the whereabouts of some
stolen property, for the stipulated fee, one mark, which had not been
paid him. The defendant claimed that he owed this man only "his hire for
his labor," but R. Isaac b. Samuel (twelfth century) decided for the
diviner on the ground that "in such matters it is customary to pay more
than merely enough to cover the labor involved"—that is, he recognized
the professional status of the plaintiff. It is significant that not a
word of condemnation or censure was expressed in this
decision.[26](jms35.htm#an_14_26.md)

While this means of divination seems to have been most often used in
cases of theft, it was also employed to disclose events that were yet to
occur. The "princes" whom the diviner conjured were bound to reply to
any question put to them, provided, of course, that the sorcerer had the
power to make them respond.

What was the nature of the "princes," and in what degree were the
visions that the boys reported real? In the fourteenth century a French
writer contemptuously dismissed these phenomena with a skepticism that
rings quite modern: "Magicians are especially prone to employ as their
mediums children who are credulous and impressible, and who, influenced
by tales heard from old wives, are ready to see a demon in every
shadow." There were others who accepted the occult significance, if not
the objective reality of such visions, adopting Plato's explanation that
"the soul of the gazer is thrown back upon itself by the luminosity of
the object seen and then exercises its latent powers of natural
divination," thus arguing that one may behold the future while in a
hypnotic trance. But by far most of the medieval and ancient writers,
and the masses too, did not for a moment doubt that these images were
real enough, honest-to-goodness demons, though some few, like the
priests who used their patens as crystals, "hetten glauben das allein
die hailigen engel darin erscheinen möchten and chain tewfel." Dr.
Hartlieb had no patience with such a notion; "dieselben haben gar vast
geirret," he wrote.[27](jms35.htm#an_14_27.md)

The same questions agitated Jewish minds. In general the

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "princes" were
held to be evil spirits, minions of the "power of uncleanness," and the
technique was usually denominated "divining by the invocation of
demons." This was the sole field in which the demons were privileged to
function in behalf of the Jewish magician. Eleazar of Worms, however,
insisted that they were angels, the *memunim* or celestial deputies, who
could be compelled to appear in the shape of their earthly doubles by
the proper invocations. The *memuneh* of a thief, summoned to show
himself in a polished surface, thus gave away the identity of the
malefactor, and re-enacted his actions at the time of the robbery. But
R. Eleazar was not prepared to admit that the child actually beholds
these "princes" in physical form, which was the view of one school of
"philosophers." Other philosophers hold, he wrote, that these visions
are hallucinations, with which demons and angels have the power to
delude men. Still a third group maintains that the angels penetrate the
minds of men and so shape their thoughts as to create a true picture,
which, although it is not perceived through the senses, possesses
nevertheless subjective reality. This last corresponds to his own view
of the matter.[28](jms35.htm#an_14_28.md)

#### NECROMANCY

The ancient art of calling up the spirits of the dead for divinatory
purposes was well known in Biblical and Talmudic times. Though forbidden
by the Law of Moses, Saul resorted to this means to consult with his
deceased mentor, Samuel, through the medium of the famous witch of
Endor. Talmudic strictures were hardly more effectual, for Rab, one of
the leading authorities, among others, questioned the dead. Similarly in
the Middle Ages, while the rabbis maintained the traditional doctrinal
opposition (striking, besides, a note of compassion at times: "The dead
speak only with great difficulty, therefore it is forbidden to force
them by incantations and other means to reveal the future"), the sources
disclose that various methods were known and employed. However, judging
from the comparatively few references, this mode of divination played
only a minor rôle in Jewish magic, due to the consistently condemnatory
judgment of the leaders of Jewish thought, and the deeply ingrained
sentiment of mingled fear and respect and affection for the dead.

Medieval writers repeated the meager traditional lore. We read

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

that the deceased may be interrogated only during the first twelve
months after death, when their bodies remain intact in the grave while
their souls ascend and descend. The ghost, when called upon by name,
rises feet first from the grave. On the Sabbath, however, when the
spirits of dead and living celebrate the day of rest, the necromancer
too must perforce call it a holiday. And finally, it is noted that "the
questioner hears, but sees nothing, the questioned sees, but hears
nothing, and others present neither see nor
hear."[29](jms35.htm#an_14_29.md)

The Talmud knew two kinds of necromancy, one in which the dead is raised
by naming him, the other in which he is questioned by means of a skull.
During the Middle Ages these two types were often mentioned, but it is
questionable whether they were still employed. The references to them do
not carry conviction. Other methods seem to have been more popular, such
as the practice of two friends covenanting that the first to die will
return to reveal the secrets of the celestial realm to the other. He
might do so in a dream, but he could also appear during waking hours.
"The deceased requests of his deputy angel that his intangible spirit be
clothed in and united with matter so that he may carry out his part of
the compact." In so far as the agreement contemplated such an apparition
it may presumably be included among the necromantic arts.

There are several legends reporting such a transient visit from the
grave; one tells of a R. Benjamin b. Zeraḥ who, on his deathbed,
promised to warn the members of his congregation if any disaster
impended. A short while after his demise he appeared in the synagogue
and divulged that at the instant of death he had seen a heavenly decree
inflicting a persecution upon them. Some writers, however, refused to
consider this method necromantic. They made a distinction between
"questioning the immortal spirit," which they claimed included such
compacts as well as an appeal to the spirit of the dead, and is
permitted, and "questioning the corpse" directly, which is forbidden.
But such fine hair-splitting need not concern us, as it didn't medieval
Jews in general. In common with their German neighbors, of whom Michael
Behaim of Sulzbach (fifteenth century) wrote:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Auch wirt unglaub do mit bewert,  
Das man eins toten sel beswert  
Und zwingt das sie erwider vert  
Und sagt wie ir beschichte*,

</div>

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

they invoked the dead, spirit and body, to gain the information they
sought. Indeed, not only the spirit, but actually the body was believed
to rise from the grave, for we are told that "if one were to open the
grave while the necromancer is conversing with the dead it would be
found empty."[30](jms35.htm#an_14_30.md)

Other methods described in the sources comprise: 1. "incantations" at
the grave, which were apparently not favored, for the word *laḥash*
usually denotes a forbidden type of magic; 2. spending the night on the
grave, clothed in a distinctive garment and burning spices and incense
while waving a myrtle wand, "until one hears an exceedingly faint voice
from the grave responding to his questions, so faint that it seems
hardly to be sensed by the ear, but rather to exist in his thoughts";
this method was also frowned upon for it was included in the forbidden
category of magic which depends solely upon "the performance of an act"
for its results; 3. "A man and a woman station themselves at the head
and foot of a grave, and on the earth between them they set a rattle,
which they strike while they recite a secret invocation; then while the
woman looks on the man puts the questions, and the deceased reveals the
future to them"; 4. a method which seems to have been acceptable, for it
invoked the dead by means of angelic names: "Stand before the grave and
recite the names of the angels of the fifth camp of the first firmament,
and hold in your hand a mixture of oil and honey in a new glass bowl,
and say, 'I conjure you, spirit of the grave, Neḥinah, who rests in the
grave upon the bones of the dead, that you accept this offering from my
hand and do my bidding; bring me N son of N who is dead, and make him
stand erect and speak with me without fear, and have him tell me the
truth without fear, and I shall not be afraid of him; let him answer the
question which I shall put to him'; and the deceased will immediately
appear. But if he doesn't, repeat this invocation a second time, and if
necessary, a third. When he appears place the bowl before him, and
converse with him. Hold a myrtle wand in your
hand."[31](jms35.htm#an_14_31.md)

#### BURIED TREASURE

One of the peculiar beliefs that were epidemic during the Middle Ages,
especially in Germany, was in the presence of hidden treasure in the
earth. The folk-tales of Northern Europe have familiarized every child
with the ghostly blue flame that sometimes flickers on the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

ground above the hiding-place of a hoard. But only too rarely were such
fitful markers to be encountered, and people were not content to await
patiently the stroke of luck which would make them rich. The
divining-rod (Rhabdomancy) provided a surer means of uncovering the
riches of the earth. There are some today who still insist that the
forked stick can disclose hidden springs—of water, not of wealth (I have
myself seen the rod incline toward the earth in the hands of credulous
country-folk, but it refused to work for me)—but just as the object of
the search has become prosaic and trivial, so has the technique
degenerated. A modern water-diviner could never hope to find any more
solid treasure than he seeks; the magic has evaporated, the quest has
literally lost its charm.

Several fifteenth-century Jewish formulas for making and using a
divining-rod, which adhere closely to the texts of German recipes, have
been printed. The Yiddish-Deutsch in which the spells are couched, the
names employed in them, the very belief on which they are based, clearly
indicate that they were borrowed from German originals. The following
directions given in one text are characteristic of the entire genre: "On
midsummer night, after sunset, go to a year-old hazel tree and select
four rods which grew that year; bind them together and grasp them in
your left hand, while you pass the right, in which you have placed gold
and silver coins, three times around them, and recite this: 'May these
rods be as successful as our father Jacob's were, for when the flock
beheld them, they bore young in their likeness; may these rods as surely
reveal to me hidden treasures, whether of coin, or valuable objects, or
jewels. I conjure you by the name of El Shaddai, the rock of ages, by
the name I Am That I Am, by the name of Him who knows the future, by the
name of Michael, of Kutiel, of Luel, by the name of Luel, of Kutiel, of
Michael.' Leave the silver and gold there, and in the morning, before
sunrise, go to these rods and cut them, in the direction of the sun, and
in the direction of the four cardinal points, east, west, north, south,
and as you cut each rod, say, \[the preceding is in Hebrew, what
follows, in Yiddish-Deutsch\]: 'Liber Gott, ich bitte dich, dass du
gebst Macht zu diesen Ruthen, dass sie mich müssen weisen auf die Statt
die Rechtfertigkeit, so da liegt verborgen Silber oder Gold, gemünzt
oder ungemünzt, es sei verborgen oder es sei sonst dar kommen, es sei
ober der Erden, es sei unter der Erden, in Gottes Namen Amen.'" There
follows an adjuration of the rods by various names and natural
phenomena. Then slits are cut and they are set into

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

each other to make two forks, while another spell calling on El, Eli,
Eloa, Agla, Adonai, Sabaot, Tetragrammaton, is recited. Two boys carry
these forks into the open fields and the diviner follows them, muttering
fearful spells which make no sense at all in Hebrew but are really
transliterations from the Latin. The invocation ends finally, "I conjure
you by the living God, I conjure you, rods, by the true God, by the holy
God, that from this moment you bend toward the spot where this treasure
is concealed," etc. When the rods have fulfilled their destiny (or
should one say "if"?) and the digging begins, there is another
hocus-pocus jumble of words, in which "hocus-pocus" makes its debut in
literature. And then comes the grand climax, the glitter of gold and
jewels through the broken earth. But at this juncture the
treasure-hunter is apparently struck dumb—or else it is left for him to
find the words which can adequately close his profitable
adventure.[32](jms35.htm#an_14_32.md)

The device was used not only to discover buried wealth, but also to
obtain sought-after information. The rods were prepared in the same way,
but the invocation was adjusted to suit one's needs. This one is
typical: "I conjure you, hazel rods, by the Creator, and by the
Patriarchs . . . that you reveal to me my request concerning my friend.
If he has done it, then go upward; if he has not done it, then remain
still. By the almighty God, Amen." There follows a series of other
conjurations, by "the three who were ready to die for the truth" (Dan.
3:19ff.), by the Torah, by the Tetragrammaton, and by other, less
comprehensible names, intended to impress upon the forked stick its
owner's insistence upon a truthful reply.[33](jms35.htm#an_14_33.md)

There were also other methods of tracing hidden treasure. One of them
required that a certain "holy and pure" name be inscribed on a small
gold plate "which has been refined seven times," and bound with a blue
thread on the neck of a male white dove, which was then to be set loose.
The spot on which it alights conceals the hoard. One must circumambulate
the place seven times before beginning to dig, "and if it is in the
daytime, speak the name of the sun in that season, and if at night, the
name of the moon." Another instructed: "When something is concealed in a
house or in a room, and you don't know where, dig a pit in the center of
the place, a man's height deep and as wide as you please; dry the sides
of the pit as well as you can, and kindle a fire in it. Then put dung or
the like on the fire, cover it with a tub, and damp it well so that no
smoke can come out. Then you will see the smoke issuing out of the
ground

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

in the spot where the hidden thing lies."[34](jms35.htm#an_14_34.md) It
must be a mighty precious "thing" to warrant such heroic measures to
recover it!

#### TRIAL BY ORDEAL

The ordeal is not usually thought of as a divinatory device, but this is
its essential character. It constituted an invocation of supernatural
aid, an appeal to the immediate judgment of God, an elaborated mode of
sortilege. During the Middle Ages various forms of the ordeal were
popular, and were sanctioned by Church and State; indeed special
liturgical formularies were drawn up for its application, and it was
conducted directly under the ægis of the clergy. Jews also occasionally
resorted to the ordeal. The best-known Biblical example is the procedure
employed in the case of a woman suspected of adultery (Nu. 5:11-31),
which was abolished before the year 70 C.E. A privilege issued by Henry
IV to the congregation of Speyer in 1091, providing that "Jews could not
be compelled to undergo ordeals by fire and water," might be construed
as a concession to an active Jewish aversion to ordeals. But medieval
Jews were not opposed to ordeals *per se;* they merely refused to submit
to tests which had been endued with a sectarian character. In fact they
forbade bathing in "unclean water" upon which priests had invoked the
name of their God preparatory to using it for the water-ordeal. This
form was not employed by Jews because its popularity with Christians had
stamped it as "heathenish," but other acceptable forms were recognized.
When some hot-headed young men proposed the immediate execution of
certain suspected sorceresses, "the sage" reproved them with the words,
"Israel is not in his own land!" and suggested instead that an
announcement be made in the synagogue, at a time when the suspects were
present, that if any children were harmed "the teeth of these women
would be ground with the stones that surround the well, and the guilty
ones will die within the hour."[35](jms35.htm#an_14_35.md)

A popular medieval belief which was accepted by Jews was that the wounds
of a murdered person begin to bleed again in the presence of the
murderer—the so-called "trial by blood" or "ordeal of touch." The Jewish
sources note two curious variations on this theme, which are apparently
unique: if a man who has just had some soup draws near, the corpse will
spurt blood (therefore one should always consume a piece of bread after
soup), and also if one

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

approaches it with a knife to which particles of food adhere. A cognate
belief, met with in the folklore of several peoples, is embraced in the
"kinship ordeal," according to which the body of a father possesses an
affinity for the blood of his son. A story is told of Saadia Gaon, and
again, of Solomon, before whom two claimants to an estate appeared, each
maintaining he was the true son and heir. The judge had a bone from the
dead man's body placed successively into two bowls containing blood
drawn from their veins; the bone absorbed the blood of the real son, but
rejected the blood of the impostor.[36](jms35.htm#an_14_36.md)

Israel Isserlein's biographer relates an incident which, while it did
not constitute an actual ordeal by fire for judicial purposes, involved
a challenge reminiscent of Elijah's contest with the priests of Baal. A
preacher and miracle-worker (probably the well-known Franciscan, John
Capistrano, the fifteenth-century scourge of heresy) came to
Wiener-Neustadt, Isserlein's home, and launched a vitriolic attack upon
Judaism. The rabbi publicly offered to follow the cleric through a
bonfire, to test the relative merits of Judaism and Christianity, but
"the priest went his way and nothing came of the
matter."[37](jms35.htm#an_14_37.md)

The trial by combat, or duel, was another form of the ordeal carried out
under ecclesiastical auspices, with the aid of the prescribed ritual. In
theory at least, it was not a test of strength and skill, but of
righteousness, and its special character derives from the faith of the
combatants that God would sustain the arm of the just man. Despite its
superimposed Christian features, however, Jews are to be included among
medieval duellists, though it is possible that the more objectionable
parts of the rite were eliminated when the contestants were Jewish.
Otherwise it is difficult to understand how pious Jews could have
subjected themselves to a trial which involved the invocation of the
Christian deity. At any rate, Frederick I of Austria, in 1244, issued a
privilege to the Jews which provided that if the murderer of a Jew could
not be convicted by direct proof of the commission of the crime, but
strong circumstantial evidence fixed the deed on him, then the relatives
or friends of the Jew could appoint a champion to meet the accused in a
duel. This privilege, which was incorporated in statutes issued by
various Central European rulers, contemplated the appearance of
Christians in the lists in behalf of Jewish litigants. But Jews
themselves also took up the sword or lance to settle a dispute with the
aid of God. On

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> November 28, 1194,
the royal court in London issued the following order: "A day is fixed
for Chermin the Jew and Samson, brother of Brin, for the plea by duel on
the octaves of St. Hilary. . . . Let them come prepared for that duel at
Totelle." The English "Fine and Oblate Rolls" for the years 1204-1206
record that "Elyes Blund, Jew of Lincoln, gives 200 marks and 2 marks of
gold that the duel pledged against him at Nottingham, in the sixth year,
may remain." Nor was it unknown for Jews on the continent to fight
duels, relying upon the supernatural to judge the merit of their
cause.[38](jms35.htm#an_14_38.md)
