#### CHAPTER IV

#### MAN AND THE DEMONS

<span id="an_4_1">1</span>. Ch. V, p. 7a.

<span id="an_4_2">2</span>. *Ber.* 6a and Rashi; *Git.* 68a; Rashi on
Nu. 22:23.

<span id="an_4_3">3</span>. *Nishmat Ḥayim*, III, 27; Isserles to *Yore
Deah* 179:16. Prof. Ginzberg considers the statement "they are more
God-fearing than men are" to be essentially Islamic; Güd. I, 207, n. 3;
*HaḤayim*, IV, so; *Nishmat Ḥayim*, III, 27.

<span id="an_4_4">4</span>. *Ber.* 43b—a man who walks alone is in
danger of attack from demons; two walking together are safe, though they
must be on guard; three walking together need have no fear at all; a
torch may be considered the equivalent of one companion; Judah b.

the Pious*, §43-4; cf. Grimm, III, 435, §14; *Kiẓur Shelah*, 75-7
(*Inyane Tefilat HaDerech*).

<span id="an_4_5">5</span>. Cf. *Pes.* 112b, *Meg.* 3a, *San.* 44a;
*Maḥ. Vit.* 507-8; Güd. I, 294; *S. Ḥas.* 239, 468, 939; Maharil, 86b;
Solomon Luria, quoted in *B’er Heteb* on *Yore Deah* 116:5; *Nishmat

Weil, 74a; cf. Samter, 131 ff.

<span id="an_4_6">6</span>. *Pes.* 112b, *Maḥ. Vit.* 81, 83-4, *S. Ḥas.*
1909; Marmorstein, *JJV*, I (1923), 306, cites an early source which
adds ‏ובמוצאי שבת ובמוצאי יום טוב‎; see also H. Gollancz, *Clavic.
Sal.*, 39;—cf. *Ber.* 6a and *Tos.*, ad loc.; Rashi, *Shab.* 24b;
*Semag*, II, 19; *S. Ḥas. B* 1170; HaTerumah, 94b-c; *Rabiah*, §10, p.
8, and §196, pp. 240-1; *Mordecai*, *Shab.*, §564, p. 13c; *Kol Bo*,
§35; *Maḥ. Vit.*, 280; *HaPardes*, 22a; Tyrnau, *Minhagim*, 4b. The
original reason for introducing a shortened *‘Amidah* in the Friday
night service, as Prof. Ginzberg pointed out to me, was that at first
this was the only evening service during the week; it was given this
superstitious explanation when the *Ma‘arib* became a daily service.

<span id="an_4_7">7</span>. Cf. *Ber.* 54b—"Three require protection
\[from the demons\]: an invalid, a bridegroom and a bride. Another
version has it: an invalid, a woman in confinement, a bride and a groom.
Some add, also a mourner." Cf. also Rashi, ad loc.

<span id="an_4_8">8</span>. Cf. Landshuth, p. xx; Samter, 21 ff.; *JE*,
IV, 92 ff.; Ginzberg, *Legends*, VI, 341, n. 118.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span id="an_4_9">9</span>. "Testament of Solomon," *JQR*, *OS*, XI
(1899), 20; Marmorstein, *JJV*, II (1925), 355 f.

<span id="an_4_10">10</span>. *Ẓiyuni*, Toc, 22b; *S. Ḥas.* 305, 327,
1544; Hut. 94a; Tyrnau's *Minhagim*, 7b, §61; *Nishmat Ḥayim*, II, 26;
*Lebush*, *Yore Deah*, 179: 54; Grimm, II, 698 f., Samter, 79.

<span id="an_4_11">11</span>. Ed. Gaster, 301 ff.; Prof. Ginzberg writes
(p. 686): "This is to my knowledge the earliest story about a Dibbuk,
which is first met with in the writings about Luria and his pupils. The
nearest to that given in the *Ma‘aseh Book* is the one told about Luria
and Vital in the different versions of *Shibḥe HaAri*, which, however,
were published later than the M. B." See, however, Scholem, *EJ*, V,
1099, where mention is made of a Safed protocol of 1571 containing
reference to a Dibbuk. On Kabbalistic metempsychosis see Franck, 200
ff.; C. D. Ginsburg, 124 f.; Bloch, *MGWJ*, XLIX (1905), 160.

<span id="an_4_12">12</span>. Gregory the Great, in his *Dialogues*,
recounted the curious tale of a nun who ate a lettuce-leaf without
making the sign of the cross, and was immediately possessed of a demon,
which had been sitting on the leaf. (Lea, III, 381, Thorndike, I, 639.)
The belief in demonic possession was so strongly held that the Catholic
Church has a rite of "Ordination of Exorcists," *De Ordinatione
Exorcistarum*, and a "Form of Exorcising the Possessed" (Summers, 207
ff., 211 ff.). This far the Synagogue certainly never went, though we
have records of exorcisms utilized by individual Jews (cf. Scholem, loc.
cit., 1099-1100). For the Talmudic view see Blau, 13, 31, 34, 55.

<span id="an_4_13">13</span>. Ḥayim b. Bezalel expressed this view most
clearly in his Sefer *HaḤayim*, IV, 10; Menasseh b. Israel (*Nishmat
Ḥayim*, III, 10) again says the final word in the matter: "This is one
of those traditions which require no proof."

<span id="an_4_14">14</span>. *Zera‘ Kodesh*, by Moses b. Menaḥem of
Prague, Furth 1696, end. The technique of exorcism among Jews and
Gentiles shows a close relationship, even to such fine points as the
requirement that the spirit make its exit through a specified spot on
the body (in the case mentioned, the little toe of the right foot), and
leave a sign of its departure, either on the body, or as here, in a tiny
hole which it was to bore in the window-pane to permit egress. Cf. De
Givry, 164 f.

<span id="an_4_15">15</span>. See Ginzberg, *Legends*, V, 148, n. 47.
This belief was equally widespread in medieval Christendom, and was
accepted as literally true by the Church. In fact, physical relations
between spirits and humans were believed to be the most characteristic
feature of the witch-cults, and some medieval writers attributed the
alarming development of witchcraft to the attractions of such a
relationship. See Lea, III, 383 ff.; Summers, 90 ff.

<span id="an_4_16">16</span>. Cf. *Erub.* 18b and Rashi. This theory was
very popular with the later mystics and appears often in the writings of
the Horowitz family, *e.g.*, *‘Emek Beracha*, II, §52, p. 60b, note by
Isaiah; also p. 61b of the same work; *Yesh Noḥalin*, 18b, n. 17. It is
because of this view that the avoidance of *keri* occupies such a
prominent place in the mystical hygiene of this group.

<span id="an_4_17">17</span>. *Disputation of R. Jeḥiel*, 15. Menasseh
b. Israel (*Nishmat Ḥayim*, III, 16) discusses this question at some
length, and with considerable erudition: one opinion has it that the
demons, themselves without physical attributes of any kind, gather up
the semen and use it to impregnate women and themselves; another, that
demons do possess sex organs and are capable of physical union with men
and women; a third admits of such a possibility only when demons
temporarily assume human forms and seduce the children of men. Menasseh
b. Israel draws here on Christian as well as Jewish sources; he forbears
to commit himself to one or another of these views, but does not
question the possibility of such unnatural carnal relations. These views
find striking expression in medieval Christian thought. Thomas Aquinas
explains how by acting alternately as succubus and

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

incubus, the demon could bear man offspring, while William of Auvergne
"regards demons as incapable of sexual intercourse with human beings,
but he thinks it possible that they may juggle with nature so as to
produce the effects of sexual intercourse." The views of these two
outstanding teachers of the thirteenth century were accepted and often
repeated by their successors. Cf. Lea, III, 385, Thorndike, II, 358, IV,
310.

<span id="an_4_18">18</span>. Such a story is to be found in the
*Ma‘aseh Book*, 383 ff.; Gaster suggests in his notes that this seems to
be a German folktale, but the essential element, a demon marrying a
girl, is as Jewish as it is German, or, indeed, of any other
nationality.

<span id="an_4_19">19</span>. *Ẓiyuni*, 49b. This is an interesting
version of the well-known sociological phenomenon that when members of
two races mate, their offspring are regarded as belonging to that race
which is socially inferior, while within this group they tend to
arrogate to themselves a superior position.

<span id="an_4_20">20</span>. *Or Zarua*, I, §124, p. 22c;—*Responsa* of
R. Meir b. Gedaliah (Maharam) of Lublin, 116.

<span id="an_4_21">21</span>. *Kab HaYashar*, 69. Although the date of
this event, 1681-2, is late, the passage is faithful to the beliefs of
an earlier period. An interesting parallel to the episode of the forced
separation between the demon and her human lover is afforded in an early
Aramaic incantation in which a magical *get* (a bill of divorcement)
achieves a like result; cf. Montgomery, 159.—That the proper habitat of
demons is the desert and the mountain is an ancient and widely held
belief (cf. Mat. 12:43). The banning of demons into these places occurs
often in Babylonian-Assyrian, Hellenistic, and post-Talmudic Aramaic
incantations and exorcisms. Cf. Montgomery, 78, n. 60.

<span id="an_4_22">22</span>. The outstanding work on the subject is S.
Seligmann's *Die Zauberkraft des Auges and das Berufen*, Hamburg, 1922;
cf. also Elworthy, *The Evil Eye*, London 1895; Wuttke, 162 ff.;
Bischoff, 50 ff.

<span id="an_4_23">23</span>. Grünbaum, *Ges. Auf.*, 105 and *Nishmat
Ḥayim*, III, 27.

<span id="an_4_24">24</span>. See Blau, 152 ff.; A. Löwinger, "Der Böse
Blick nach jüdischen Quellen," Menorah, IV (1926), 551-69; Grünbaum,
loc. cit.; R. Lilienthal, "‘Ayin Hara‘," *Yidische Filologye*, I (1924),
245 ff.; Montgomery, 89.

<span id="an_4_25">25</span>. *Ẓiyuni*, 65c: according to the
"scientists," "there are men who can work havoc with the merest glance,"
and also animals "whose roar spreads death a bow-shot away."

<span id="an_4_26">26</span>. *Nishmat Ḥayim*, loc. cit.; Rashi on Nu.
12:1, *Suk.* 53a, and Ex. 30:12 (cf. II Sam. 24: I ff.); *S. Ḥas.* 534;
*Netivot ‘Olam*, 107d;—*Rokeaḥ* 296; *Kol Bo* §74; Gaster, *Studies and
Texts*, III, 228;—*Tashbeẓ*, 190; *Leket Yosher*, II, 38; *Oraḥ Ḥayim*
141:6;—Isserles, *Eben Ha‘Ezer* 62:3; Rashi, *B.B.* 2b. Since the
seventeenth century belief in the evil eye has become very prominent in
Jewish superstitions; the expressions "unbeschrieen," "unberufen," or,
in Hebrew, "no evil eye," have become automatic accompaniments on Jewish
lips of the slightest compliment. See Lilienthal, op. cit., for a
detailed account of East-European Jewish beliefs.

<span id="an_4_27">27</span>. Cf. Elworthy, 8; Thorndike, I, 217, II,
608; *Netivot ‘Olam*, loc. cit.; *S. Ḥas.* 981, 1823.

<span id="an_4_28">28</span>. De Givry, 92.

Bo* 30; *Tashbeẓ*, 551; *Yore Deah* 335:1 and *Ned.* 40a; *S. Ḥas.*
1446.

<span id="an_4_30">30</span>. Schwab, *Vocabulaire*, 7; *Lev Tov*,
6:112, p. 67a; *Testament* of Shabbetai Horowitz, §11; Landau and
Wachstein, *Jüdische Privatbriefe*, passim; etc.

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span id="an_4_31">31</span>. Cf. *S. Ḥas.* 1, 1464, 1435, 1436, 688,
858, 705; *Kiẓur Shelah*, 149; *Leket Yosher*, II, 83. Not all rabbis
were obsessed by this superstition. This same Isserlein, replying to a
query as to whether the statement, "I'll be baptised before I let my
mother-in-law put foot in my house!" was to be regarded as a vow,
limited himself to the immediate question, and passed up an excellent
opportunity for a homily on the evils of making such remarks (*Pesakim
Uketabim*, §192).

<span id="an_4_32">32</span>. 7. *Meg.* I, 72b; *J. Yoma* I, 38d; B.M.

*HaḤayim*, I, 7; cf. *Tos.* *Meg.* 31b. It was customary not to call
anyone to the Torah by name when the *Tochaḥah* was to be read, but the
invitation was extended to "whoever wished" to accept it. In Mainz the
practice was to stipulate, when employing a sexton, that he must read
the chapter when no one else was willing to do so; cf. *Maharil*, *Hil.
Keriat HaTorah*, Isserles, *Oraḥ Ḥayim*, 428:6; *JE*, XII, 175; E. N.
Adler, *Jews in Many Lands*, Phila. 1905, p. 178. Reifmann wrote in 1841
(Zion, I, 184) that he himself saw a man refuse to eat bread which had
been placed before him while he was reading the "chapter of
maledictions."
