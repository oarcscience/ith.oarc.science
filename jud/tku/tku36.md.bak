# CHAPTER XXVIII.

### CONCERNING THE BRAIN AND MEMBRANE OF THE BRAIN OF MICROPROSOPUS.

559\. IN the cavities of the skull three hollow places are found wherein
is located the brain.

560\. And a thin membrane is placed therein, but not a thick membrane,
hidden also as that of the Ancient of Days.

561\. And therefore is this brain expanded, and it shineth (or
proceedeth) in thirty-two <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) paths. The
same is that which is written, Gen. ii. 7: "And a river went forth out
of Eden."

562\. Also we have learned that in the three hollow places of the skull
the brain is contained.

563\. Out of the first cavity proceedeth a certain fountain of the brain
in four directions, and it goeth forth from the skull, in whose cavity
are contained those thirty-two paths which are the spirits of wisdom.

564\. Out of the second cavity there goeth forth and expandeth a second
certain fountain, and the fifty gates (*of the Understanding*) are
opened.

565\. In those fifty gates are contained the fifty days of the law; the
fifty years of the jubilee; and the fifty thousand generations wherein
the most holy God--blessed be He!--intendeth to restore and commemorate
His Spirit in them.

566\. From the third cavity there go forth a thousand times a thousand
conclaves and assemblies, wherein DOTh, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_99.md) *Daath*, Knowledge, is contained and
dwelleth.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

567\. And the hollow place of this cavity is placed between the other
two cavities <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](tku37.htm#fn_100.md) and all
those conclaves are filled from either side.

568\. This is that which is written, Prov. ii. 4: "And in knowledge
shall the conclaves be filled."

569\. And those three are expanded over the whole body, on this side and
on that, and with them doth the whole body cohere, and the body is
contained by them on every side, and through the whole body are they
expanded and diffused.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_98"></span>[180:1](tku36.htm#fr_99.md) These are the
thirty-two paths of the "Sepher Yetzirah," symbolised by the ten numbers
of the decad, and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[180:2](tku36.htm#fr_100.md) It is to be remembered
that, according to the "Book of Concealed Mystery," Daath is the
conjunction of the second and third Sephiroth. Wisdom and Understanding,
the I and H of IHVH, the Supernal Father and Mother.
