# CHAPTER XLI.

### CONCERNING THE SEPARATE MEMBERS OF EACH PERSONIFICATION, AND ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE ARMS OF MICROPROSOPUS.

997\. HEREUNTO have adhered together both the Woman and the Man; now in
Their condition are They separated in arms and limbs.

998\. Of the Male, one arm is right and the other left.

999\. In the first arm (otherwise in the holy arm) three members <span
id="fr_182"></span>[2](#fn_181) (or divisions.md) are bound together.

1000\. And the two arms are completed. And they are perfected in three
members in the right arm, and in three members in the left arm.

1001\. The three members of the right arm correspond to the three
members of the left arm.

1002\. And therefore is mention only made of the one

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

arm. For of the arms there is only made mention of that on the right
side; but in Exod. xv. 6 it is called, "Thy right hand, O
Tetragrammaton!"

1003\. Therefore it is said "the right hand of Tetragrammaton," with
reference to the three divisions of the Patriarchs <span
id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_182.md) who have occupied those parts.

1004\. And if thou shalt say: "Also these are found (*symbolized*) in
the three cavities of the skull."

1005\. We have learned that all these three (*as to their conceptions*)
are expanded through and connected with the whole body (*of
Microprosopus*) through those three which are bound together in the
right arm.

1006\. And therefore David desired Him, and said, Ps. cx. i: "Sit thou
with those on my right hand," that he might be associated with the
Patriarchs, and sit there in the perfect throne.

1007\. And therefore it is written, Ps. cxviii. 22: "The stone which the
builders rejected," because that he sat on the right hand.

1008\. This is that which is written, Dan. xii. 13: "And thou shalt
rest, and rise again in thy lot at the limit of My right hand." <span
id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_183.md)

1009\. Like as if it were said: "Even as he who is worthy of the
friendship of the King is happy when the King extendeth His right hand,
and placeth him at His right hand."

1010\. But when He sitteth, certain members are extended as to this
right hand, but the arm extendeth not the hand (otherwise, when He
sitteth, also the members are not extended, and the arm is not stretched

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

forth but remaineth still), with its three members, of which mention
hath been made before.

1011\. But when sinners are stirred up and spread abroad in the world,
three other members are excited, which are severe judgment, and His arm
is stretched forth.

1012\. And when that arm is stretched forth, it is as it were the right
hand (also); but it is called "the arm of Tetragrammaton": "O
Tetragrammaton! Thine arm hath been stretched forth" (1 Kings viii. 42).

1013\. When these three members are contained in those three, all are
called the right hand, and judgment is exercised and mercy.

10l4. This is that which is said, Exod. xv. 6: "Thy right hand, O
Tetragrammaton, is marvellous in power; with Thy right hand, O
Tetragrammaton, wilt Thou dash in pieces the enemy;" seeing that therein
are stirred up the mercies.

10l5. Also, we have learned that unto this right hand adhere three
hundred and fifty thousand myriads (otherwise, which are called the
right hand, and one hundred and eighty-five thousand myriads) from the
arm, which is called the arm of Tetragrammaton.

1016\. Therefore, from either side is the arm (*i.e., it is either the
right arm or the left arm*), because that it is said (to be) on either
side of Tiphereth. <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_184.md)

1017\. For it is written, Isa. lxiii. 12: "That led Moses to his right
hand, by the arm of his Tiphereth."

1018\. The first expression denoteth the right; but the "arm" denoteth
the left; for it is written, "by the arm of his Tiphereth," one (*side*)
with the other (*i.e., right and left*).

1019\. Moreover, we have learned that to that which is on the left side
there adhere four hundred and fifty <span
id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_185.md)

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

Lords of Shields, and that they adhere unto those separate fingers.

1020\. And in the single fingers there are found ten thousand Lords of
the Shields. Go thou then forth, and number how many of them there are
in the hand.

1021\. And this right hand is called the Holy Aid, which cometh forth
from the right arm, from the three. members (*thereof*).

1022\. And although it be called the hand, yet is it Aid, since it is
written, 2 Sam. iii. 12. "And behold, My Hand is with thee."

1023\. And in it are contained one thousand and four myriads and five
hundred and eight thousand lords, the aiders in every world, <span
id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_186.md) who are called the supernal hand of the
Tetragrammaton, the inferior hand of the Tetragrammaton.

1024\. And although everywhere it be called the hand of Tetragrammaton,
it is understood (*that sometimes*) the left hand <span
id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_187) (*is intended to be spoken of*.md). For if
they be benevolent, it is called the right hand of Tetragrammaton, and
the hand is included in the arm, and is for aid, and is called the hand;
and if, on the other hand, it be not so, the inferior hand of
Tetragrammaton is (*to be understood*).

1025\. We have learned that when the severe judgments are excited so
that they may descend into the world, that then it is written, Ps. xxv.
14: "The Arcanum of Tetragrammaton is over those who fear Him."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_180"></span>[235:1](tku48.htm#fr_181.md) This partakes of
alchemical symbolism--Mezahab, the philosophical Mercury.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[235:2](tku49.htm#fr_182.md) As in the arm there
are three natural divisions, from shoulder to elbow, from elbow to
wrist, and from wrist to the tips of the fingers. The word QShRIN, here
translated "members." means, properly speaking, "zones."

<span id="fn_182"></span>[236:1](tku49.htm#fr_183.md) This word in the
original is ABHThA, *Ebahatha*, which, according to the context, may
mean simply "Fathers"; or in a more emphatic sense, "Patriarchs"; this
latter is the sense in which it is employed in this passage. The three
Patriarchs are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for this word Ebahatha is not
employed to denote the twelve sons of the latter.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[236:2](tku49.htm#fr_184.md) This is usually
translated "at the end of the days." This translation is simply due to a
difference in the *pointing*, the words being the same in
orthography--thus, IMIN.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[237:1](tku49.htm#fr_185.md) See table of the
Sephiroth, &c., in the Introduction, where it will be seen that
Tiphereth is as it were the centre.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[237:2](tku49.htm#fr_186.md) 450 = ThN, *Than*,
which is the root of Serpent or Dragon. Compare Leviathan, which is
probably formed from this root.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[238:1](tku49.htm#fr_187.md) That is, on every
qabalistical plane. (See Introduction regarding the Four Worlds, &c.)

<span id="fn_187"></span>[238:2](tku49.htm#fr_188.md) For in Microprosopus
there is always right and left. Mercy and Justice; while in
Macroprosopus all is said to be "right." But Microprosopus is manifest,
and Macroprosopus is hidden.
