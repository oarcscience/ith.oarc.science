<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.</H3>
<P>559. THE nose of Microprosopus is the form of His countenance, for therethrough is His whole countenance known.</P>
<P>560. This nose is not as the nose of the most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments.</P>
<P>561. For the nose of Him, the Ancient One, is the life of lives for all things, and from His two nostrils rush forth the <I>Ruachin De-Chiin</I>, RVChIN DChIIN, spirits of lives for all.</P>
<P>562. But concerning this (<I>nose of</I>) Microprosopus it is written, Ps. xviii. 9: "A smoke ascendeth in His nose."</P>
<P>563. In this smoke all the colours are contained. In each colour are contained multitudes of lords of most rigorous judgment, who are all comprehended in that smoke.</P>
<P>564. Whence all those are not mitigated save by the smoke of the inferior altar.</P>
<P>565. Hence it is written, Gen. Viii. 21: "And IHVH smelled a sweet savour." It is not written (<I>He smelled</I>) the odour of the sacrifice. What is "sweet" save "rest?" Assuredly the spirit at rest is the mitigation of the Lords of judgment.</P>
<P>566. (<I>When therefore it is said</I>) "And IHVH smelled</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A></P>
<P>the odour of rest," most certainly the odour of the sacrificed victim is not meant, but the odour of the mitigation of all those severities which are referred unto the nose.</P>
<P>567. And all things which adhere unto them, all things, I say, are mitigated. But most of these severities mutually cohere.</P>
<P>568. As it is written, Ps. cvi. 2: "Who shall recount GBVRVTh IHVH, the Geburoth of Tetragrammaton?"</P>
<P>569. And this nose (<I>of Microprosopus</I>) emitteth fire from the two nostrils, which swalloweth up all other fires.</P>
<P>570. From the one nostril (<I>goeth forth</I>) the smoke, and from the other nostril the fire, and they both are found on the altar, as well the fire as the smoke.</P>
<P>571. But when He the most Holy Ancient One is unveiled, all things are at peace. This is that which is said, Isa. xlviii. 9: "And for My praise will I refrain from thee" (<I>literally, "block up thy nostrils"</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>).</P>
<P>572. The nose of the Most Holy Ancient One is long and extended, and He is called Arikh Aphim, Long of Nose.</P>
<P>573. But this nose (<I>of Microprosopus</I>) is short, and when the smoke commenceth, it issueth rapidly forth, and judgment is consummated.</P>
<P>574. But who can oppose the nose of Him the Ancient One? Concerning this, all things are as we have said in the Greater Assembly, where concerning this matter the Companions were exercised.</P>
<P>575. In the book of the treatise of Rav Hamenuna the Elder he thus describeth these two nostrils (<I>of Microprosopus</I>), saying that from the one proceed the smoke and the fire, and from the other, peace and the beneficent spirits.</P>
<P>576. That is, when (<I>Microprosopus</I>) is considered as having (<I>in Himself the symbolism of</I>) right side and left side.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A></P>
<P>As it is written, Hosea xiv. 7: "And his smell like Lebanon."</P>
<P>577. And concerning His Bride it is written, Cant. vii. 9: "And the smell of thy nostril like apples." Which if it be true concerning the Bride, how much more concerning Himself? And this is a notable saying.</P>
<P>578. When therefore it is said, "And Tetragrammaton smelled the odour of peace," the word HNIChCh, <I>Ha-Nichach</I>, of peace," can be understood in a double sense.</P>
<P>579. One sense is primary, when the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments, is manifested; for HVA, <I>Hoa</I>, He, is the peace and mitigation of all things.</P>
<P>580. And the other respecteth the inferior mitigation, which is done through the smoke and fire of the altar.</P>
<P>581. And because of this duplicate meaning is the word NIChCh, <I>Nichach</I>, written with a double Ch. And all these things are said concerning Microprosopus.</P>
