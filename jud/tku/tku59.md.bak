# CHAPTER VI.

### CONCERNING THE BEARD OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT ONE.

150\. From the Beard of the Most Holy Ancient One hangeth the whole
ornament of all, and the Influence; for all things are called from that
beard, Influence.

151\. This is the Ornament of all Ornaments, and this influence do all
the superiors and inferiors alike behold.

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

152\. From this Influence dependeth the life of all things.

153, From this Influence heavens and earth depend, the rains of grace,
and the nourishment of all things.

154\. From this Influence cometh the providence of all things. From this
Influence depend all the superior and inferior hosts.

155\. Thirteen fountains of excellent and precious oil depend from this
beard of most glorious Influence, and they all flow down into
Microprosopus.

156\. Say not thou, however, that all do so, but nine of them are found
(*in Microprosopus*) for the purpose of diverting the judgments.

157\. And whensoever this Influence hangeth down in equilibrium even
unto the heart, all the Holinesses of the Holinesses of Holiness depend
from it.

158\. In that Influence is extended an expansion of the Supernal
Emanation, <span id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_229.md) which is the Head of
all Heads, which is not known nor perfected, and which neither superiors
nor inferiors have known, because from that Influence all things depend.

159\. In this beard the Three Heads concerning which we have spoken are
expanded, and all things are associated together in this Influence, and
are found therein.

160\. And therefore every ornament of ornaments dependeth from that
Influence.

161\. Those letters which depend from this Ancient One all hang in that
beard, and are associated together in that Influence.

162\. And they hang therein for the purpose of establishing the other
letters.

163\. For unless those letters could ascend into the Ancient One, those
other letters could not be established.

164\. And therefore Moses saith when necessary IHVH,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

\[paragraph continues\] IHVH, twice; and so that an accent distinguishes
the one from the other.

165\. For assuredly from the Influence all things depend.

166\. By that Influence are both superiors and inferiors brought into
reverence, and are prostrate before It.

167\. Blessed is he who attaineth hereunto.
