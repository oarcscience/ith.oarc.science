# CHAPTER XV.

### CONCERNING THE FOURTH PART OF THE BEARD OF MACROPROSOPUS.

378\. THE hair is disposed in the fourth conformation, and it descendeth
beneath the mouth from the one side even unto the other side.

379\. That is intimated (in the saying of Micah) in these words: "Of the
remnant of his heritage:" LShAIRITh NChLThV, *Lishairith Nachalatho*.

380\. Like as it is said in 2 Kings xix. 4: "And thou shalt lift up thy
prayer for the remnant that is left." Where every part that is found
truly remaining is called the remnant.

381\. For it is written, Zeph. iii. 13: "The remnant of Israel, ShARITh
IShRAL, *Sharith Israel*, shall not do iniquity."
