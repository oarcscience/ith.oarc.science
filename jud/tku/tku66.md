# CHAPTER XIII.

### CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF MICROPROSOPUS.

496\. THE forehead of the Skull (*of Microprosopus*) is the forehead for
visiting sinners (otherwise, for rooting out sinners).

497\. And when that forehead is uncovered there are excited the Lords of
judgments against those who are shameless in their deeds.

498\. This forehead hath a rosy redness. But at that time when the
forehead of the Ancient one is uncovered over against this forehead, the
latter appeareth white as snow.

499\. And that time is called the Time of Grace for all.

500\. In the "Book of the Teaching of the School of Rav Yeyeva the
Elder" it is said: The forehead is according as the forehead <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_274.md) of the Ancient One. Otherwise, the
letter *Cheth*, Ch, is placed between the other two letters, according

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

to this passage, Num. xxiv. 17: "VMChTz, *VeMachetz*, and shall smite
the corners of Moab?"

501\. And we have elsewhere said that it is also called NTzCh,
*Netzach*, the neighbouring letters (*M and N; neighbouring letters in
the alphabet that is, and allied in sense, for Mem = Water, and Nun =
Fish, that which lives in the water*) being counterchanged. (*Netzach =
Victory, and is the seventh Sephira*).

502\. But many are the NTzChIM, *Netzachim*, Victories; <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_275) so that another (development of.md) Netzach
may be elevated into another path, and other Netzachim may be given
which are extended throughout the whole body (*of Microprosopus*).

503\. But on the day of the Sabbath, at the time of the afternoon
prayers, the forehead of the Most Holy Ancient One is uncovered, so that
the judgments may not be aroused.

504\. And all the judgments are subjected; and although they be there,
yet are they not called forth. (Otherwise, and they are appeased.)

505\. From this forehead depend twenty-four tribunals, for all those who
are shameless in their deeds.

506\. And it is written, Ps. lxxiii. 11: "And they have said, 'How can
El know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?'"

507\. But truly (the tribunals) are only twenty; wherefore are four
added? Assuredly, in respect of the punishments of the inferior
tribunals which depend from the Supernals.

508\. Therefore there remain twenty. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_276.md) And therefore unto none do they adjudge
capital punishment until

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

he shall have fulfilled and reached the age of twenty years in respect
of these twenty tribunals.

509\. But in our doctrine regarding our Arcana have we taught that the
books which are contained in the Law refer back unto these twenty-four.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_274"></span>[309:1](tku66.htm#fr_277.md) The word translated
forehead is MTzCh, *Metzach*; now if a metathesis be formed of this word
by placing the last letter between the first and second letters, we get
*MChTz*, he shall smite. Hence the first form symbolizes Mercy, and the
second, Severity.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[310:1](tku66.htm#fr_278.md) And therefore is the
divine name of Tzabaoth, or hosts, attributed both to Netzach and to
Hod, the seventh and eighth Sephiroth. as may be seen by referring to
the Introduction, and to the "Book of Concealed Mystery," ch. iii. 15,
annotation.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[310:2](tku66.htm#fr_279.md) And 20 is H, *He*, in
the four worlds. for H = 5, which, multiplied by 4 = 20.
