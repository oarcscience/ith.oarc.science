# CHAPTER XXIV.

### CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER CONCERNING MACROPROSOPUS.

494\. RABBI SCHIMEON spake unto his companions, and said: "When that
veil is expanded (*by which is to he understood the representation of
the beard of Macroprosopus*) which ye behold above us, <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_77) I see that all the conformations have
descended therein, and that they shine forth in that place. (*Now like
as if he intended to say, AMN, Amen, the discourse concerning
Macroprosopus being finished, he describeth this particular symbolism,
which is contained in the ensuing symbols*.)

495\. "And a certain covering, even the splendour of the most holy and
blessed God (*otherwise the opening of holiness; but by this is
understood the Tetragrammaton, which, together with the name, ADNI,
Adonai, maketh the number of the word AMN, Amen, that is 91*): is
expanded through four columns on four sides (*which are the four letters
of the holy name, by which he saith that space is surrounded*).

496\. "One column is so placed that it reacheth from the lowest unto the
highest. (*This is the Kingdom of the emanations*, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_78) *the base and lowest Part of the whole
system* <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_79) *of emanation, because it is
said to ascend from the lowest part of the middle column* <span
id="fr_81"></span>[4](#fn_80) *even unto the summit of the Crown*. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[5](#fn_81))

497\. "And therein is a certain MGRVPIA, <span
id="fr_83"></span>[6](#fn_82) *Megerophia*, vessel containing fire (

for like as the fire an the altar could not be touched with bare hands,
so that

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

name, Tetragrammaton, cannot be touched and pronounced by the mouth, but
it is touched and produced by ADNI, Adonai, which is ShM, Sham, His
name; for ShM and MGRVPIA both Yield 340 by Gematria); and in the
fire-containing vessel are four keys, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_83) sharp on every side (*for such was the
form of the keys, in order that they might draw aside the veil, as a
lock is shot back by a key. But the four letters of the name ADNI,
Adonai, are hereby to be understood, which are inserted into and united
with the four letters IHVH, in this manner, IAHDVNHI*); which seize upon
that. veil, and withdraw it from the superiors.

498\. "And thus in the second column <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_84)
and the third column and the fourth column (*that is, the four letters
are applied to the other four letters, as hath just been said*).

499\. "And between one column and another column are contained
eighteen <span id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_85) bases of columns (*here is
to be understood the name expanded through the seventy-two* <span
id="fr_87"></span>[4](#fn_86) *names or numbers; for either pertain unto
Macroprosopus, and four times eighteen yieldeth seventy-two*): and they
shine forth with brilliancy in the openings carved out in

that veil, and so on all four sides. (*By the "openings carved out" is
to be understood the exposition of the name, Tetragrammaton*.)

500\. "I beheld those forms which shine above it, and await the words of
our lips, that they may be crowned and raised each in its own place.

501\. "And when they are expounded by our lips, they ascend singly and
are crowned, and are disposed in that order which is here given forth by
the mouth of whosoever amongst us (*happeneth to be expounding them*).

502\. "And whensoever anyone amongst us openeth his mouth, so that he
may speak concerning any conformation, that form is localized and
awaiteth the voice which goeth forth from our lips, and then it
ascendeth in its place and is crowned.

503\. "And all the columns on this side and on that side rejoice (*here
are understood the holy living creatures, the cherubim, which were
before the columns, and the chiefs of the angelic guards, and they are
said to have come hither*); because they hear that which before they
knew not. <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87) And in the sound of your
voices are heard the rushing of countless chariots (*the noise of the
wings of the hosts of the angelic chariots of God, rushing onwards*);
and they stand here around you in multitudes, awaiting the speech of
your voice.

504\. "O blessed are ye in the world to come! because all the words
which go forth from your mouth are all holy, all true, which err not,
neither on the right nor yet on the left (*seeing they are the holy
names of God*).

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

505\. "God, the holy and blessed one, rejoiceth to hear these things,
and He listeneth unto these words until He himself shall give sentence,
for in the world to come all these holy words shall be enumerated for
the second time.

506\. "Concerning you is it written, Cant. vii. 9: 'And the roof of thy
mouth, like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly,
causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.'

507\. "What is this? 'Causing the lips of those that are asleep to
speak.' Because even in the world to come shall your lips utter the
words of the law before Him."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_77"></span>[169:1](tku32.htm#fr_78) Again alluding to their
symbolical representation of the ten Sephiroth.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[169:2](tku32.htm#fr_79) Malkuth, the tenth
Sephira.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[169:3](tku32.htm#fr_80) The Sephiroth.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[169:4](tku32.htm#fr_81) Or Pillar of Mildness,
consisting of the first, sixth, ninth, and tenth Sephiroth.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[169:5](tku32.htm#fr_82) Kether. "Malkuth is
Kether after another manner," says one of the qabalistic axioms of
Pistorius.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[169:6](tku32.htm#fr_83) I believe the beat
translation of Megerophia is a "fire shovel." Knorr de Rosenroth makes
it "uncus focarius."

<span id="fn_83"></span>[170:1](tku32.htm#fr_84) Quatuor claves traditæ
sunt in manu Domini mundi, quas non tradidit neque ulli Angelo, neque
seraphino: clavis pluviæ: clavis suatentationis: clavis sepulchorum:
clavis sterilitatis, &c. (Zanolini: Lexicon Chaldæo-Rabbinicum," art.
MPThCh, root PThCh.)

<span id="fn_84"></span>[170:2](tku32.htm#fr_85) These four columns also
refer to the four worlds of Atziloth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Asiah. (See
Introduction.)

<span id="fn_85"></span>[170:3](tku32.htm#fr_86) 18 = ChI = Life.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[170:4](tku32.htm#fr_87) In Exodus xiv. are
three verses (19, 20, and 21), which each consist of 72 letters. Now, if
these three verses be written at length one above another, the first
from right to left, the second from left to right. and the third from
right to left (or, as the Greeks would say. *boustrophedon*), they will
give 72 columns of three letters each. Then each column will be a word
of three letters, and as there are 72 columns, there will be 72 words of
three letters, each of which will be the 72 names of the Deity alluded
to in the text. And these are called the Schemahamphorasch, or the
divided name. By writing the verses all from right to left, instead of
*boustrophedon*, &c., there will be other sets of 72 names obtainable.
(See annexed Table of the Schemahamphorasch.)

<span id="fn_87"></span>[171:1](tku32.htm#fr_88) I must again remind the
reader that Rabbi Schimeon and his companions are speaking as
symbolizing the action of the Sephiroth in the creation, and that when
it is said the angels, &c., wait for the words from their lips, it
signifies symbolically the way in which the angels, &c., were created by
the word of the Deity in his Sephirotic form. And when it is said that
"they hear that which before they knew not," it signifies the creation
of forms, powers, and attributes which at the beginning of time existed
not.
