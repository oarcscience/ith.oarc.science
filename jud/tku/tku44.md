# CHAPTER XXXVI.

### CONCERNING THE SECOND PART OF THE BEARD OF MICROPROSOPUS.

862\. "THE second conformation. The hair goeth forth and ascendeth from
the beginning of (*the one side of*) the mouth even unto the beginning
of the other side of the mouth; and descendeth beneath the mouth unto
the other side, hair above hair, in beautiful arrangement. Arise, Rabbi
Abba!"

863\. Rabbi Abba arose, and commenced and said: "When the disposition of
this beard is instituted in the formation of the King, then is He
Himself like a brave hero, strong and beautiful in appearance, valiant
and conquering.

864\. "This is that same which is written, Ps. cxlvii. 5: 'Great is our
Lord and great is His power.'

865\. "And whilst He is mitigated by the disposition of the venerable
and holy beard (*of Macroprosopus*), and this (*beard of Microprosopus*)
reflected that, then through its light is He called 'God merciful,'
Exod. xxxiv. 6: 'and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness
and in truth.' And thus is the second disposition instituted.

866\. "When He shineth in the light of the Ancient

of Days, then is He called 'abundant in Mercy,' and when another of the
other forms is considered, in that form is He called 'and in truth,' for
this is the light of His Countenance."
