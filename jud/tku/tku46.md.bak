# CHAPTER XXXVIII.

### CONCERNING THE SEVEN LAST PORTIONS OF THE BEARD OF MICROPROSOPUS.

880\. "THE fourth conformation. This path of hairs is, disposed, and
ascendeth and descendeth in His cheeks into the place of fragrance.

881\. "This disposition is fair and beautiful in appearance, and it is
Glory and Honour; and it is taught in Barietha that the Supernal Honour,
HVD, *Hod*, goeth forth and is crowned, and floweth down, so that it may
be comprehended in His cheeks, and is called the Honour of the Beard.

882\. "And thence depend Glory and Honour, which are as vestments, and
as very precious purple, so that He may be clothed therewith.

883\. "For it is written, Ps. civ. 1: 'Thou art clothed with Honour and
Majesty.' (Otherwise: In the fourth conformation the hair goeth forth,
and is disposed, and ascendeth and descendeth in the cheeks, in the
places of fragrance. This conformation is elegant and beautiful in
appearance, and it is the supernal glory. And this is the tradition: The
supernal glory goeth forth, and is crowned, and floweth down in the
beauty of the cheeks. And this glory is called the glory of the beard;
and from it depend honour and glory, the vestments of adornment, those
magnificent purple garments wherewith he is clothed. Concerning which it
is written: 'Thou art clothed with honour and majesty, which are the
forms of clothing. In this form of man is he formed, rather than in any
other form.)

884\. "These are the dispositions denoting the clothing (*of the divine
form*), and he is more fitly symbolized

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

under this figure of man than under any other forms.

885\. "Also we have learned, that when this glory (*of Microprosopus*)
is illuminated by the light of the excellent beard, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) and emitteth light into the other
dispositions, then it is called 'Bearing Iniquity' on the one side, and
'Passing over Transgression' on the other side.

886\. "And therefore in Scripture is it called by the name of his
jawbones.

887\. "And in the 'Book of Concealed Mystery' is the same called Glory,
HVD, <span id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_155.md) *Hod*, and Honour, HDR,
*Hadar*, and ThPARTh, <span id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) *Tiphereth*,
Beauty.

888\. "And unto *Tiphereth*, Beauty, appertaineth the title 'Passing
over Transgression,' since it is said, Prov. xix. it 5: 'And it is His
Beauty (*Tiphereth*) to pass over transgression.'

889\. "Also we have learned that we should only refer that *Tiphereth*,
Beauty, unto the ninth conformation (*of the beard of Microprosopus*);
as it is said, Prov. xx. 29: 'And the beauty of young men is their
strength.' And therefore also is it (the ninth conformation) called
Beauty; and when they are weighed together in the balance they are as
one."

890\. Rabbi Schimeon said unto him: "Worthy art thou, O Rabbi Abba! for
which reason mayest thou be blessed by the Most Holy Ancient One, from
whom all blessings proceed.

891\. "The fifth conformation. The hair is wanting, and there appear two
apples, on this side and on that, red as red roses, and they radiate
into two hundred and seventy worlds.

892\. "As to those two apples, when they shine on either side, from the
light of the two supernal apples (*the cheeks of Macroprosopus*),
redness is removed therefrom, and a white brilliance cometh upon them.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

893 "Concerning this is it written, Num. vi. 25: 'Tetragrammaton make
His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee.' Seeing that when
they shine he is blessed by the world.

894\. "But when that redness is stirred up (*in them*), it is written,
*ibid*. 26: 'Tetragrammaton take away His wrath from thee;' as if it
were said: 'It is taken away, and wrath is no longer found in the
world.'

895\. "We have learned that all the lights which shine from the Most
Holy Ancient One are called the former benignities, because all those
lights are the benignities of time.

896\. The sixth conformation. The hair goeth forth as it were in a
certain tress, among the hairs in the circumference of the beard; and
this is called one of the five angles which depend from the ChSD,
*Chesed*, Mercy and Compassions.

897\. "And it is not permitted to lose this benignity, as it is said.

898\. Therefore is it written, Lev. xix. 27: 'Thou shalt not lose the
angle of thy beard.'

899\. "The seventh conformation is that the hairs hang not over the
mouth, and that the mouth is uncovered on every side. Arise thou, Rabbi
Yehudah."

900\. Rabbi Yehudah arose, and commenced, and said, Dan. iv. 17: "'This
matter is by the decree of the Watchers.'

901\. "Many thousands of myriads stand around, and are preserved by this
mouth, and depend therefrom, and all those are called (*by the general
title of*) the mouth.

902\. "As it is written, Ps. xxxiii. 6: 'And all the host of them by the
Spirit of His mouth.'

903\. "And by this Spirit which goeth forth from the mouth are all those
exteriors clothed who depend from that mouth.

904\. "And by that mouth, when that path is opened, are

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

clothed many true prophets; and they are all called the mouth of
Tetragrammaton.

905\. "And in that place where the Spirit goeth forth no other thing is
mingled therewith; for all things wait upon that mouth, that they may be
clothed with the Spirit going forth therefrom.

906\. "And this disposition ruleth over the six (*foregoing
conformations*), because herein are all things established and
comprehended.

907\. "And therefore are the hairs (*of this conformation*) equal around
the mouth, and this itself is uncovered on every side."

908\. Rabbi Schimeon said (*unto him*): "Blessed be thou, by the Most
Holy Ancient One.

909\. "The eighth conformation is that the hairs descend beneath the
beard, covering the throat, that it cannot be seen.

910\. "For we have learned in the exotic tradition that neither the
throat nor any of its parts (*are apparent*) through (*the hair*). And
if in the time of contest (otherwise of Victory, NTzCh, *Netzach* <span
id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_157).md), during such contest any portion of
(*the throat*) be visible, then it appeareth like Strength
(*Geburah*). <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_158.md)

911\. "For we have learned that a thousand worlds are contained thereby.

912\. "This is that which is said, Cant. iv. 4: 'Wherein there hang a
thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.' And this 'thousand
shields' is an Arcanum.

913\. "It is related in the 'Book of Concealed Mystery' that 'all the
shields of the mighty men,' which come from the side of the
rigours, <span id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_159.md) are derived from those
severities (*Geboran*, GBVRAN).

914\. "The ninth conformation is that the hairs flow

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

down in perfect equilibrium even unto those hairs which hang down
beneath, and all of them in beautiful arrangement, like (*that of*) a
brave hero, (*of*) a chief victorious in war.

915\. "Because all the hairs follow those which hang down, and all are
joined unto those which hang down, and each holdeth its own course.

916\. "Concerning this it is written, Prov. xx. 29: 'The beauty of a
young man is his strength.'

917\. "And He appeareth upon the (*Red*) Sea, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](tku47.htm#fn_160.md) like a beautiful youth, which
is written in Cant. v. 16: 'Excellent (or young) as the cedars.'

918\. "Like a hero hath He exhibited His valour, and this is that
ThPARTh, ChILA, VGBVRThA, VRChMI, *Tiphereth*, *Chila*, *Ve Geburatha*,
*Ve Rechemi*, Beauty, Strength, and Valour, and Mercy."
