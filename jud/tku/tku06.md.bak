# CHAPTER III.

1\. Nine are said to be the conformations of the beard (of
Microprosopus). For that which remaineth concealed (that is, the other
four forms, which meanwhile are not found in Microprosopus), and which
is not manifested, is supernal and venerable (that is, properly and of
itself doth not refer to Microprosopus, but nevertheless descendeth upon
him in another manner).

\[It must be remembered that the beard of Macroprosopus had thirteen
divisions, therefore the other four forms are the difference between the
nine of Microprosopus and the thirteen of Macroprosopus.\]

2\. Thus, therefore, is this most excellent beard arranged. The hairs
overhang the hairs from before the opening of the ears, even unto the
beginning of the mouth. (This is the first conformation.)

3\. From the one beginning even unto the other beginning (of the mouth.
This is the second conformation--namely, the beard on the upper lip).

4\. Beneath the two nostrils existeth a path filled with hairs, so that
it appeareth not. (This is the third conformation.)

5\. The cheeks extend on one side and on the other. (This is the fourth
conformation.)

6\. In them appear apples red as roses. (This is the fifth
conformation.)

7\. In one tress hang down those hairs strong and black, even unto the
breast. (This is the sixth conformation.)

8\. Red are the lips as roses, and bare. (This is the seventh
conformation.)

9\. Short hairs descend through the place of the throat and cover the
position of the neck. (This is the eighth conformation.)

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

10\. Long and short descend alike. (This is the ninth conformation.)

11\. Whosoever is found among them, is found strong and robust. (That
is, he who directeth his meditations herein.)

12\. It is written, Ps. cxviii, 4: "I called upon *Yah*, IH, in
distress." (In this place) David commemorateth (these) nine
(conformations) even unto (those words) "all nations compassed me
about," in order that they (the nine above mentioned) might surround and
protect him.

13\. (It is written, Gen. i. 12) "And the earth brought forth
germination, the herb yielding seed after its kind; and the tree bearing
fruit, whose seed is therein, according to its kind."

14\. Those nine (paths of Microprosopus) are evolved from the perfect
name (that is, from the understanding or mother, in whom they were
conceived; for unto her pertaineth the name IHVH, which is
Tetragrammaton expressed and Elohim hidden, which form the nine in
power). And thence are they planted into the perfect name, like as it is
written, Gen. ii. 8: "And IHVH ALHIM planted" (that is, these nine
letters of the perfect masculine and feminine name, so that they may be
a garden--that is, Microprosopus in action).

\[By the expression "Tetragrammaton expressed and Elohim hidden," is
meant that the former is written with the vowel points of the latter.
They "form nine in power," because the four letters IHVH together with
the five letters ALHIM make nine.\]

15\. The conformations of the beard (of Microprosopus) are found to be
thirteen when that which is superior becometh inferior. (That is,
whensoever the beard of Macroprosopus sendeth down its light. But in the
inferior (that is, Microprosopus taken by himself), they are beheld in
nine (parts of that form).

16\. The twenty-two letters are figured forth in their

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

colour; not only when the law is given forth in black fire upon white
fire, but also in ordinary writings, because this beard is black.)

\[The number of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet is twenty-two. "Black
fire" and "white fire" are the colours of the beards of Microprosopus
and of Macroprosopus respectively.\]

17\. Concerning this (beard, that is understood which is said)
concerning him who in his sleep beholdeth the beard. "When any one
dreameth that he taketh the upper beard of a man in his hand, he hath
peace with his Lord, and his enemies are subject unto him."

\[By the "upper beard" is meant the moustache.\]

18\. Much more (if he seeketh to touch) the supernal beard. For the
inferior light, taking its rise from the supernal light which existeth
within the benignity (thus the beard of Macroprosopus is entitled), is
called in Microprosopus the benignity in a more simple manner; but when
it hath its action within the light, and it shineth; then is it called
abounding in benignity. (Others read this passage thus:--He who dreameth
that he toucheth the moustache of a man with his hand, he may be sure
that be hath peace with his Lord, and that his enemies are subject unto
him. If that happeneth because he beholdeth in sleep such a thing as
this only, much more shall it occur if he be found sufficiently worthy
to behold what the supernal beard may be. For this, seeing that it is
the superior, and is called the benignity, irradiateth the inferior. But
in Microprosopus, &c.\]

19\. It is written, Gen. 1. 20: "Let the waters bring forth the reptile
of a living Soul" (Ch-IH, *Chiah*, living creature is to be here noted).

(To this section belongs the annotation which is placed at the end of
this chapter; which see.)

20\. Like as it is said IH, *Yah* (Ch-IH, *Chiah*, the corrected Mantuan
Codex hath it, so that it may explain the word ChIH, *Chiah*, living
creature, out of the eighth

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

path of the understanding, which is that water of the name *Yah*, which
denoteth father and mother. For when) the light of the former is
extended unto the latter (which is the moving of the water) all things
reproduce their kind at one and the same time--the waters of good and
the waters of evil. (That is, there is reproduction as well in divinity
and sanctity as among terrestrial living creatures and man; for by the
reptile form souls are symbolized.)

21\. (For) while it saith: IShRTzV, *Yeshratzu*, "Let them bring forth
abundantly," they have vital motion; and the one form is at once
included in the other form; the living superior, the living inferior;
the living good, the living evil.

22\. (So also it is written, Gen. i. 26) "And Elohim said, Let us make
man." (Where) it is not written HADM, *Ha-Adam*, "this man"; but Adam,
man, simply, in antithesis of the Higher One who hath been made in the
perfect name.

\[Regarding the "form of the heavenly man, see Introduction, § 55.\]

23\. When that one was perfected, this one also was perfected; but
perfected as male and female, for the perfecting of all things.

24\. (When therefore it is said) IHVH, *Yod, He, Vau, He* (then is
expressed), the nature of the male. (When) ALHIM, *Elohim* (is joined
therewith, there is expressed), the nature of the female (who is called
the kingdom).

\["The female who is called the kingdom," *i.e.*, Malkuth, the tenth
Sephira.\]

25\. (Therefore) was the male extended, and formed with his members (in
order that he might have), as it were, regenerative power.

\[The "members of the male" are the six Sephiroth which together form
Microprosopus.\]

26\. By means of this regenerative power those kings,

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

who had been destroyed, were herein restored, and obtained stability.
(For when the lights were sent down through narrow channels in less
abundance, the inferior intelligences could take possession of them.)

\[The "kings who had been destroyed" are the "Edomite kings;" the
"worlds of unbalanced force," "who could not subsist because the form of
the heavenly man" was not as yet. See Introduction, § 41. 56.\]

27\. The rigours (of judgments, which are symbolized by those kings),
which are masculine, are vehement in the beginning; but in the end they
are slackened. In the female the contrary rule obtaineth.

28\. (We have an example of this in this form of the name) VIH (where
the male hath two letters, and the female one only; and the masculine
also the letter in the beginning long, and afterwards short. But also in
this form) the channels of connection are shrouded beneath His covering
(that his, the supernal letters are doubtless connected in marital
conjunction, but they are enshrouded in the letter *Vau*. And) *Yod* (is
in this place) small, (a symbol of the foundation; because) in the very
form (of the female, that is, even as he is hidden within H, *He*, which
also is not the supernal but the inferior H, *He*) he is found. (And all
are judgments, because the supernal influx is wanting.)

29\. But if (these) judgments are to be mitigated, necessarily the
Ancient One is required (that is, the first letters of the
Tetragrammaton, denoting, IH, *Yah*, the father together with the crown,
which is the apex of the primal letter, and is called Macroprosopus.)

30\. The same species of rigours and judgments occurred in the
inferiors. For like as to the *He* of the bride, are added the two
letters *Yod* and *Vau*, under the idea of the leviathan; (so) the
serpent came upon the woman, and formed in her a nucleus of impurity, in
order that he might make the habitation evil.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

31\. Like as it is written., Gen. iv. 1: "And she conceived and brought
forth ATh QIN, *Ath Qain*, Cain, (that is) the nucleus QINA, *Qaina*, of
the abode of evil spirits, and turbulence, and evil occurrences." (See
further in the "Treatise of the Revolutions of the Soul.")

\[The "Treatise of the Revolutions of the Soul" is not published in this
volume.\]

32\. (But this name VIH) is restored (if it be written IHV; and thus) in
that man (the supernal, concerning whom it hath been spoken above; and
also) in those two (namely, the father and the mother, also in the
androgynous Microprosopus; and also partly) in genus (seeing that *Vau*
alone symbolizeth both the Microprosopus and his bride) and in species
(seeing that *Yod* and *He* are placed separately as father and mother).

33\. (But just as much) are they contained in the special
(representation of those spouses, as) also in the general (that is, as
much in father and mother as in Microprosopus with his bride); legs and
arms right and left (that is, the remaining numerations, collected
together in two lateral lines, with the middle line representing *Vau*
and *Yod*.)

34\. (But) this (that is, the supreme equality) is divided in its sides,
because *Yod* and *He* are placed expressly as the father and the
mother; but in another equality) the male is conformed with the female
(like an androgyn, because the last *He* is not added. Whence are made)
IHV.

35\. I, *Yod*, is male (namely, the father); H, *He*, is female (namely,
the mother); V, *Vau* (however, is androgynous, like as) it is written,
Gen. v. 2: "Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and
called their name Adam."

36\. (Thus also) the form and person of a man was seated upon the
throne; and it is written, Ezek. i. 26: "And upon the likeness of the
throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above it."

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

\[This piece alludes to the Tetragrammaton itself, showing the
hieroglyphic form of a man: the I = head, H = arms, V = body, and H =
legs. See Introduction and Table of Alphabet.\]

ANNOTATION.

(*Belonging to* § 19, *foregoing*.)

1\. Another explanation. "Let waters bring forth abundantly." In this
place, in the Chaldee paraphrase, it is said IRChShVN, which hath a
general meaning of movement. As if it should be said: "When his lips by
moving themselves and murmuring, produced the words, like a prayer from
a righteous heart and pure mind, the water produced the living soul."
(The meaning is concerning the act of generating life.)

2\. And when a man wishes to utter his prayers rightly before the Lord,
and his lips move themselves in this manner, (his invocations) rising
upward from him, for the purpose of magnifying the majesty of his Lord
unto the place of abundance of the water where the depth of that
fountain riseth and floweth forth (that is, understanding emanating from
wisdom); then (that fountain floweth forth plentifully, and) spreadeth
abroad so as to send down the influx from the Highest, downwards from
that place of abundance of water, into the paths singly and conjointly,
even unto the last path; in order that her bountiful grace may be
derived into all from the highest downwards.

\[H, *He*, the supernal mother.\]

3\. Then indeed is such a man held to intertwine the connecting links of
(them) all, namely, those connecting links of true and righteous
meditation; and all his petitions shall come to pass, whether his
petition be made in a place of worship, whether in private prayer.

\["Such a man"--*i.e.*, a righteous man, when praying sincerely. "Links
of them"--*i.e.*, the paths.\]

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

4\. But the petition, which a man wisheth to make unto his Lord can
ordinarily be propounded in nine ways.

5\. Either (1) by the alphabet, or (2) by commemorating the attributes
of the most holy and blessed God, merciful and gracious, &c. (according
to the passage in Exodus xxxiv. 6, &c.); or (3) by the venerable names
of the most holy and blessed God; such are these: AHIH, *Eheieh* (in
respect of the Crown), and IH, *Yah* (in respect of the Wisdom); IHV,
*Yod He Vau* (in respect of the Understanding); AL, *El* (in respect of
the Majesty); ALHIM, *Elohim* (in respect of the Severity); IHVH, *Yod
He Vau He* (in respect of the Beauty); TzBAVTh, *Tzabaoth* (in respect
of the Victory and the Glory); ShDI, Shaddai (in respect of the
Foundation); and ADNI, Adonai (in respect of the Kingdom). Or (4) by the
ten Sephiroth or numerations, which are: MLKVTh, *Malkuth*, the Kingdom;
ISVD, *Yesod*, the Foundation; HVD, *Hod*, the Glory; NTzCh, *Netzach*,
the Victory; ThPARTh, *Tiphereth*, the Beauty; GBVRH, *Geburah*, the
Severity; ChSD, *Chesed*, the Benignity; BINH, *Binah*, the
Understanding; ChKMH, *Chokhmah*, the Wisdom; and KThR, *Kether*, the
Crown. Or (5) by the commemoration of just men, such as are patriarchs,
prophets, and kings. Or (6) by those canticles and psalms wherein is the
true Qabalah. And (7), above all these, if any one should know how to
declare the conformations of his Lord, according as it is honourable to
do. Or (8) if he may know how to ascend from that which is below to that
which is above. Or (9) those who know also how to derive the influx from
the highest downward. And in all these nine ways there is need of very
great concentration of attention; because if he doeth not that, it is
written concerning him, 1 Sam. ii. 30: "And they that despise Me shall
be lightly esteemed."

\["(1) by the alphabet"--*i.e.*, according to the mystic qabalistico,
theosophic values of the letters. (2) Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7: "And the LORD
passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, the LORD

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant, in goodness and
truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression
and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's
children, unto the third and to the fourth generation." (3) By the
Divine Names associated with the Sephiroth. (4) The ten Sephiroth. (5)
Those analogous to his desire. (6) Phrases bearing on the subject. (7)
The qabalistical development of Deity. (8) By the paths. (9) The
converse of (8).\]

6\. Hereto also pertaineth the meditation of the word Amen, AMN! which
in itself containeth the two names IHVH, ADNI, *Yod He Vau He Adonaï*
(the numeration of the former alone, and of these two together yielding
the same, 91); of which the one concealeth its goodness and benediction
in that treasury which is called HIKL, *He-yekal*, the palace. (Which
word by equality of numeration is the same as ADNI, *Adonaï*, but this
name is said to be the palace of Tetragrammaton, because, in the first
place it is pronounced by its aid; also, in the second place, it is
mingled with it alternately, letter by letter, in this way--IAHDVNHI.

\[A + M + N = 1 + 40 + 50 = 91. I + H + V + H + A + D + N +I = 10 + 5 +
6 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 50 + 10 = 91. Again: H + I + K + L = 5 + 10 + 20 + 30 =
65. A + D + N + I = 1 + 4 + 50 + 10 = 65. The Jews, when they come to
the word IHVH in reading the Scriptures, either do not pronounce it at
all and make a slight pause, or else substitute for it the word
*Adonaï*, ADNI.\]

7\. And this is pointed out in that saying, Hab. ii. 20: "But the Lord
is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him."
(HIKL, *Ha-yekal*, "the temple, or palace;" HS, *Hes*, "keep silence;"
and ADNI, Adonaï, "Lord;" all have the same numeration--namely, 65.)

\[H + S = 5 + 60 = 65.\]

8\. For which reason our wise men of pious memory have said mystically,
that every good thing of a man is in his house; according to that which
is written, Num. xi.,

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 7: "He is faithful in all Mine house." Which is
the same as if it were said "in all which is with Me."

9\. But if any man attentively meditateth on the nine divisions of these
forms (*see* § 5 *ante*), like as it is meet to do; that man is one who
honoureth the Name of his Lord, even the Holy Name. And hereunto
belongeth that which is written, 1 Sam. ii. 30: "Since those who honour
Me will I honour; and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed." I
will honour him in this world, that I may preserve him, and provide him
with all things of which he hath need, in order that all nations of the
earth may see that the Name of the Lord is called upon by him; and that
they may fear him. And in the world to come he shall be found worthy to
stand in the tabernacle of the righteous.

10\. Wherefore such an one seeketh nothing of which he hath need,
because he is kept under the special providence of his Lord, and can
meditate concerning Him, as it is right to do.

11\. But what is to be understood by that passage--"And they that
despise Me shall be lightly esteemed?" Such an one is that man who can
neither institute the union of the Holy Name, nor bind together the
links of truth, nor derive the supernals into the position required, nor
honour the Name of his Lord. Better were it for that man had he never
been created, and much more for that man who doth not attentively
meditate when he saith Amen!

12\. For which reason, concerning that man especially who moveth his
lips (in prayer), with a pure heart (meditating) on those purifying
waters, in that passage expressly and clearly written, Gen. i. 26: "And
the Elohim said, Let us make man." As if it were said concerning such a
man who knew how to unite image and likeness, as it is right: And they
shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, &c.

Hereunto is the annotation.
