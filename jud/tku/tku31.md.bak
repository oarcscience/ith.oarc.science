# CHAPTER XXIII.

### CONCERNING THE THIRTEENTH PART OF THE BEARD OF MACROPROSOPUS.

466\. THE thirteenth conformation. The hairs which are beneath the beard
hang down on this side and on that in beautiful and excellent dignity,
and form a covering even unto the chest, and nothing is seen of the
countenance and of the places of fragrance save those two brilliant and
beautiful apples.

467\. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: "O how blessed is his portion who
is found in this excellent holy assembly, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_71) wherein we are (assembled.md)! Blessed is his
portion in this world and in the world to come.

468\. "For we are seated in that excellent holiness which surroundeth
us.

469\. "And all those excellent conformations are coordinated, and
crowned, and placed round about, each in its own (*proper*) position, in
the holy form of the beard.

470\. "And this thirteenth disposition is the beautiful disposition
which exciteth in itself so great desire that the head <span
id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) ariseth towards it.

471\. "From it depend all those which are comprehended in Microprosopus;
from it depend alike those which are supernal, those which are inferior.

472\. "This is the form of perfection which consummateth

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

all the dispositions, and which perfecteth all things.

473\. "We have learned by tradition. Those parts <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) are called QDM, *Qadam*, <span
id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_74.md) ancient days, days first of the first. But
those which are found in Microprosopus are called OVLM, Olahm,
everlasting days, or days of the ages.

474\. "Also we have learned that those QDM, *Qadam*, ancient days, are
all conformed in the conformations of the beard, wherein is composed the
Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed of the Concealed Ones. But
this thirteenth (*conformation*) comprehendeth them. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_75.md)

475\. "And all the concealed superiors and inferiors are concealed in
it, and they are comprehended in that influx from which all things
emanate; like as it is said:

476\. "And that day is not comprehended in them, seeing it comprehendeth
all things.

477\. "And in that time wherein is stirred up the Ancient of Days in the
superior conformations, that is called one day wherein He ariseth to
magnify His beard.

478\. "Which is intimated in those words, Zech. xiv. 7: 'One day which
is known to the Lord.'

479\. "That alone prevaileth over all, that includeth all things that is
called by the known name.

480\. "For thus we have learned. In that place where there is day there
is also night, seeing that day cannot exist without night.

481\. "But because in that time shall be the time of the dignity of the
beard, that day is found alone.

482\. "It is called neither day nor night, for it is not

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

called day except for our (*better understanding of the symbolism
involved*), neither is it called night except for the same reason.

483\. "And because that form includeth all things, hence nothing
whatsoever is known or seen concerning it.

484\. "And from it streameth down the oil of magnificence in thirteen
directions, which flow down upon all the inferiors in order that they
may shine forth.

485\. "In that oil are consummated the thirteen parts of the holy and
excellent beard.

486\. "And those forms which are in that beard are disposed and descend
in many directions, neither can it be seen how they are extended nor how
they arise.

487\. "They are hidden in all things, and they are concealed in all
things; and no man knoweth their place, except Him, the Ancient One.

488\. "In their expansion are they all included, like as it is said:

489\. "He is known, and He is not known; He is concealed, and He is
manifest.

490\. "Concerning Him it is written. Isa. xlii. 8: 'ANI IHVH HVA <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_76.md), *Ani Tetragrammaton Hoa*, This is My
name, and My glory I give not unto another.'

491\. "Also it is written, Ps. c. 2: 'HVA, *Hoa*, He, hath made us, and
not we ourselves.'

492\. "Also it is written, Dan. vii. 9: 'The Ancient of Days did sit,'
that is, He remained in His place, and Him hath no man known. He
sitteth, but He is not found.

493\. "Also it is written, Ps. cxxxix. 14: 'I will praise Thee, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_71"></span>[166:1](tku31.htm#fr_72.md) Because this assembly
of ten Rabbis, as I have before remarked, was intended to typify the ten
Sephiroth and their grouping.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[166:2](tku31.htm#fr_73.md) This somewhat obscure
text means this: The number of the parts of the beard are 13, which are
now completed in this disposition. But 13 = AChD, *Achad*, Unity, and
also AHBH, *Ahebah*, Love. Hence love of unity ariseth when the 13 are
complete. And the head of Macroprosopus ariseth, because that is Kether,
the first Sephira, the number one, unity.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[167:1](tku31.htm#fr_74.md) That is, the thirteen
conformations of the beard.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[167:2](tku31.htm#fr_75.md) And hence is
Macroprosopus called the "Ancient of Days." Qadam also means the east,
eastward. "Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden, MQDM, *Miqedem*,
eastward (or of ancient time), in Eden." It is worthy of notice that the
Gematria of QDM and OVLM are 144 and 146 respectively; the least numbers
of which are 9 and 2--Yesod and Chokmah, foundation and wisdom.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[167:3](tku31.htm#fr_76.md) By way of synthesis, as
if it were a repetition of the rest conjointly.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[168:1](tku31.htm#fr_77.md) There are 10 letters in
this phrase = 10 Sephiroth. "Ani Tetragrammaton Hoa, This is My name;"
for in this are contained Macroprosopus, Microprosopus and the
Tetragrammaton. ANI represents Microprosopus; HVA represents
Macroprosopus and is also ABA the Father; and IHVH is between them. Ani
is 61 and ABA is 4 which together give 65, which is ADNI, *Adonai*,
Lord; and IHVH = 26, which added hereunto is 91 = AMN, *Amen*. Now,
apart from the sacred ideas we attach to Amen, it is well to know that
the ancient Egyptians called their greatest Deity *Amen*, AMN, Amen-Ra.
and Ra = Light, AVR in Hebrew; Amen our Light, the light of the two
countenances.
