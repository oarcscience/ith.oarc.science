# CHAPTER IX.

### CONCERNING THE EYES OF MACROPROSOPUS.

112\. THE eyes of the White Head <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) are
diverse from all other eyes. Above the eye is no eyelid, neither is
there an eyebrow over it.

113\. Wherefore? Because it is written, Ps. cxxi. 4: "Behold, He that
keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep;" that is, the superior
Israel.

114\. Also it is written, Jer. xxxii. v. 19: "Whose eyes are open."

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

115\. And this is the tradition. Seeing that all is operated through
mercies, He hath not covering unto His eye, nor eyebrow above His eye;
how little, then; doth the White Head require such.

116\. Rabbi Schimeon spake unto Rabbi Abba, and said: "To what is this
like?" He answered unto him: "To the whales and fishes of the sea, which
have no coverings for their eyes, nor eyebrows above their eyes; who
sleep not, and require not a protection for the eye.

117\. "How much less doth the Ancient of the Ancient Ones require a
protection, seeing that He far above His creatures watcheth over all
things, and all things are nourished by Him, and He Himself sleepeth
not.

118\. "This is that which is written, Ps. cxxi. 4: 'Behold! He that
keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.' That is, the superior
Israel.

119\. "It is written, Ps. xxxiii. 18: 'Behold the eye of the Lord is
upon them that fear Him;' and it is written, Zech. iv. 10: 'They are the
eyes of the Lord, running to and fro throughout the whole earth.

120\. "There is no contrariety (*between these sayings*); one is
concerning Microprosopus, and the other concerning Macroprosopus.

121\. "And further, although there be two eyes, yet they are converted
into one eye.

122\. "This is pure in its whiteness, and so white that it includeth all
whiteness.

123\. "The first whiteness shineth, and ascendeth and descendeth for the
purpose of combining with that which is connected (*with it*) in
connection.

124\. "This is the tradition: That whiteness darteth forth its rays, and
igniteth three lights, which are called HVD, Hod, Glory, VHDR,
*Vehedar*, and Majesty, VChDVH. *Vachedoah*, and Joy; and they radiate
in gladness and in perfection.

125\. "The second whiteness shineth and ascendeth and

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

descendeth, and darteth forth its rays, and igniteth three other lights,
which are called NTzCh, *Netzach*, Victory, ChSD, *Chesed*, and
Benignity, ThPARTh, *Tiphereth*, and Beauty; and they radiate in
perfection and in gladness. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)

126\. "The third whiteness radiateth and shineth, and descendeth and
ascendeth, and goeth forth from the part enclosing the brain, and
darteth forth its rays toward the seventh middle light.

127\. "And it formeth a path to the inferior brain, and formeth a path
to the inferior, and all the inferior lights are thereby ignited."

128\. Rabbi Schimeon said: Thou hast well spoken, and the Ancient of
Days will open this eye upon thee in the time of thy necessity.

129\. Another tradition runneth thus: Whiteness in whiteness, and
whiteness which includeth all other whiteness.

130\. The first whiteness shineth and ascendeth and descendeth in three
lights on the left-hand side, and they radiate and are bathed in that
whiteness, like as when a man batheth his body in good unguents and
odours, in better than he at first possessed.

131\. The second whiteness descendeth and ascendeth and shineth in three
lights on the right-hand side, and they radiate and are bathed in that
whiteness, like as when a man batheth in good [unguents](errata.htm#3.md)
and odours, in better than he at first possessed.

132\. The third whiteness shineth and ascendeth and descendeth, and
goeth forth the light of the inner whiteness of the brain, and darteth
forth its rays when necessary unto the black hair, and unto the head,
and unto the brain of the head.

133\. And it irradiateth the three crowns which remain, when it is
needful, so that it may be uncovered,

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

if that be pleasing unto the Most Ancient One hidden from all.

134\. And this is the tradition: This eye is never closed; and there are
two, and they are converted into one.

135\. All is right; there is no left there. He sleepeth hot and
slumbereth not, and He requireth not protection. He is not such an one
as hath need to defend Himself, for He defendeth all things, and He
Himself waited upon all things, and in the sight of His eye are all
things established.

136\. This is the tradition: Were that eye closed even for one moment,
no thing could subsist.

137\. Therefore it is called the open eye, the holy eye, the excellent
eye, the eye of Providence, the eye which sleepeth not neither
slumbereth, the eye which is the guardian of all things, the eye which
is the subsistence of all things.

138\. And concerning it is it written, Prov. xxii. 9, "The bountiful
eye;" thou shalt not read "the blessed eye," but "it blesseth," for it
is called "the bountiful eye," and by it are all things blessed.

139\. And this is the tradition: There is no light in the inferior eye,
so that it can be bathed in redness and blackness; except when it is
beheld by that white brilliance of the superior eye which is called "the
bountiful eye."

140\. And to no man is it known when this superior holy eye may shine
and may bathe the inferior; and when the just and the supernal blessed
ones are about to be beheld in that Wisdom.

141\. This is that which is written, Isa. lii. 8: "For they shall see
eye to eye;" When? "When the Lord shalt bring again Zion." Also, it is
written, Num. xiv. 14: "That Thou Tetragrammaton, art seen eye to eye."

142\. And unless the bountiful superior eye were to look down upon and
bathe the inferior eye, the universe could not exist even a single
moment.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

143\. This is the tradition in the "Book of Concealed Mystery;"
Providence ariseth from the inferior eye when the highest splendour
shineth down upon it, and that highest splendour goeth forth into the
inferior; for from it are all things illuminated.

144\. This is that which is written, Num. xiv. 14. "That Thou, O
Tetragrammaton! art seen eye to eye." Also it is written, Ps. xxxiii.
18: "Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him." And it is
written, Zech. iv. 10: "The eyes of the Lord running to and fro
throughout the whole earth."

145\. "The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him," if they be
upright. This is the superior eye. On the contrary, when it is said,
"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro," this is the eye which is below.

146\. This is the tradition: On what account was Joseph worthy, so that
the evil eye had no dominion over him? Because that he was worthy of
being beheld by the superior benign eye.

147\. This is what is written, Gen. xlix. 23: "Joseph is the son of a
fruitful bough; the son of a fruitful bough above Ayin." Why, "the son
of a fruitful bough above Ayin?" <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) As
though to imply, "because of that eye which beheld him."

148\. Also it is written, Prov. xxii. 9: "The bountiful eye shall be
blessed." Why? Because it giveth its bread unto the poor.

149\. Why is it said in the singular number? Come and see. In the eyes
which are inferior are a right eye and a left eye, and they are of two
diverse colours.

150\. But in this instance there is no left eye, and they both ascend in
one path, and all are right. And on that account is one eye mentioned,
and not two.

151\. And this is the tradition: This eye, which is the eye of
observation, is ever open, ever smiling, ever glad.

152\. Such are not the inferiors, who in themselves have

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

redness, and blackness, and whiteness--three colours; and are not always
open, for there are eyelids as a protection over these eyes.

153\. And concerning this matter it is written, Ps. xliv. 23: "Awake, O
Lord: why sleepest Thou?" And, 2 Kings xii. 16: "Open Thine eyes, O
Lord."

154\. When they are opened, for some are they opened for good, and on
some are they opened for evil.

155\. Woe unto him upon whom it is opened, so that the eye is mingled
with redness, and unto whom the redness appeareth, spreading across that
eye. Who can escape from it?

156\. But the Ancient of Days is blessed, presiding over that eye the
white brilliance of whiteness, seeing that also it is of such whiteness
that it endureth all whiteness.

157\. Blessed also is his portion whom that brilliance of all whiteness
irradiateth.

158\. And concerning this certainly it is written, Prov. xxii. 9: "The
good eye is to be blessed." And it is written, Isa. ii. 5: "Be ye
present, O house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of
Tetragrammaton!"

159\. This is the tradition: Save in all these instances, the name of
the Ancient One is concealed from all, and is not mentioned in the law,
save in one place, where Microprosopus sware unto Abraham.

160\. Like as it is written, Gen. xxii. 16: "By Myself have I sworn,
saith Tetragrammaton." (*Understand*) that this is said concerning
Microprosopus.

161\. Also it is written, Gen. xlviii. 20: "In thee shall Israel bless."
That is, the superior Israel.

16:. Also it is written, Isa. xlix. 3: "Israel, in whom I will be
glorified." In these passages the Ancient of Days is called Israel.

163\. But we have also stated that the Ancient of Days is called by His
name, yet both this (*statement*) and the other are correct.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

164\. This is the tradition: It is written, Dan. vii. 9: "I beheld until
the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit."

165\. "The thrones were cast down." What is this? He spake unto Rabbi
Yehuda, and said: "Stand in thy place and explain these thrones."

166\. Rabbi Yehuda answered: "It is written (*ibid*): 'His throne is of
fiery flame;' and upon that throne sat the Ancient of Days."

167\. "For what reason? Because thus is the tradition: If the Ancient of
Days were not seated upon that throne, the universe could no longer
exist before that throne.

168\. "When the Ancient of Days sitteth upon that throne, it is subject
unto Him. For He who sitteth upon it ruleth over it.

169\. "But at that time when He departeth from that throne, and sitteth
upon another throne, the first throne is overturned, lest any should
rule over it save the Ancient One, who alone can sit upon it."

170\. Rabbi Schimeon spake unto Rabbi Yehuda, and said: "May thy way be
ordained for thee, and may it be pointed out (unto thee) by the Ancient
of Days!"
