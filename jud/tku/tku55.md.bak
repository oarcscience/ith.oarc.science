# CHAPTER II

### CONCERNING THE SKULL OF THE ANCIENT ONE, AND CONCERNING HIS BRAIN; AND CONCERNING THE THREE HEADS, AND THE HAIR, AND THE DISCRIMINATORY PATHS.

51\. THE skull of the White Head hath not beginning, but its end is the
convexity of its joining together, which is extended, and shineth.

52\. And from it the just shall inherit four hundred <span
id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_214.md) desirable worlds in the world to come.

53\. And from this convexity of the joining together

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

of this White Skull daily distilleth a dew into Microprosopus, into that
place which is called Heaven; and in that very place shall the dead be
raised to life in the time to come.

54\. Like as it is written, Gen. xxvii. 27: "And Elohim shall give thee
from the dew of heaven."

55\. And His head is filled with that dew, and all the place of the
apple-trees distilleth therewith.

56\. He, the Most Holy Ancient One, is hidden and concealed, and in that
Skull is the Supernal Wisdom concealed, who is found and who is not
found.

57\. For assuredly in Him, the Ancient One, nothing is revealed save the
Head alone, seeing that that Head is itself the Head of all heads.

58\. The beginning of that Supernal Wisdom which also is itself the
Head, is hidden therein, and is called the Supernal Brain, the Hidden
Brain, the Tranquil and Calm Brain; neither doth any man know it save He
Himself.

59\. Three Heads have been formed forth, one within the other, and the
other above the other.

60\. One Head is the Concealed Wisdom, which is covered and is not
disclosed.

61\. And this Hidden Wisdom is the Head of all things, and the Head of
the remaining wisdoms.

62\. The Supernal Head is the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with
all Concealments.

63\. The Head of all Heads, the Head which is not a Head <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_215.md)--namely, that which is in that
Head--neither knows nor is known, because it cannot be comprehended
either by Wisdom or Understanding.

64\. And therefore is it read, Num. xxiv. 11: "Fly thee in thy place;"
and Ezek. i. 14. The *Chaioth*, living creatures, are said to run forth
and return.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

65\. And therefore is the Most Holy Ancient One called AIN, Ain, the
Negatively Existent; seeing that back from Him dependeth the AIN, the
Negative Existence. <span id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_216.md)

66\. But all these hairs and all those locks depend from the Hidden
Brain.

67\. And all are calm (otherwise, are disposed) in the Equilibrium;
neither in any manner is the neck seen (*i.e., because of the locks
which overshadow it*).

68\. Because He the Most Holy Ancient One is in an unvarying condition
of joy, neither changeth He from mercy for ever.

69\. But in the thirteen measurements <span
id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_217.md) of mercies is He found, because that
Wisdom hidden in Him is divided into three, <span
id="fr_220"></span>[3](#fn_218.md) paths in a quarternary, and He Himself
the Ancient One comprehendeth them, and through them doth He reign over
all things.

70\. One (*path*) which shineth in the midst of the hairs going forth
from the Skull, is that path by whose light the just are led into the
world to come.

71\. Like as it is written, Prov. iv. 18: "And the path of the just
shineth as the light."

72\. And concerning this it is written, Isa. lviii. 14: "Then shalt thou
delight thyself in Tetragrammaton."

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

73\. And from that path <span id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_219.md) are all
the other paths illuminated which depend from Microprosopus.

74\. He the Eternal Ancient of the Ancient Ones is the highest Crown
among the Supernals, wherewith all Diadems and Crowns are crowned.

75\. And from Him are all the Lights illuminated, and they flash forth
flames and shine.

76\. But He verily is the Supreme Light, which is hidden, which is not
known.

77\. And all the other Lights are kindled by Him, and derive (*their*)
splendour (*from him*).

78\. He the Most Holy Ancient One is found to have three heads, which
are contained in the one Head. <span id="fr_222"></span>[2](#fn_220.md)

79\. And He Himself is that only highest supreme Head.

80\. And since He the Most Holy Ancient One is thus symbolized in the
Triad, hence all the other Lights which shine are included in
Triads. <span id="fr_223"></span>[3](#fn_221.md)

81\. Moreover, the Most Holy Ancient One is also symbolized by the Duad.

82\. And the division of the Ancient One in the Duad

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

is so that the (*one form is*) the Highest Crown of all the Supernals,
the Head of all Heads.

83\. And (*the other is*) that superior Head, and It is not known.

84\. So also all the remaining Lights are mystically divided into Duads.

85\. Furthermore, the Most Holy Ancient One is symbolized and concealed
under the conception of the Unity, for He himself is One, and all things
are One.

86\. And thus all the other Lights are sanctified, are restricted, and
are bound tog-ether in the Unity or Monad, and are One; and all things
are HVA, *Hoa*, Himself.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_213"></span>[264:1](tku54.htm#fr_215.md) The Sephiroth.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[264:2](tku55.htm#fr_216.md) Which is the number
of Th, the last letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, which includes the
symbology of the cross.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[265:1](tku55.htm#fr_217.md) That is to say, which
will hardly admit even of so vague a definition, seeing it is the
Indefinite Absolute in Kether.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[266:1](tku55.htm#fr_218.md) We must be most
careful not to misapprehend the meaning intended to be conveyed in this
passage. Kether, the Ancient One, Macroprosopus, is not in the more
restricted sense of the first Sephira. the AIN, but that that idea links
back from Him must be manifest on consideration. Not even He, the Vast
Countenance, is hidden and concealed; how much more, then, the AIN! From
Negative to Positive. through Potential Existence, eternally vibrates
the Divine Absolute of the Hidden Unity of processional form masked in
the Eternal Abyss of the Unknowable, the synthetical hieroglyph of an
illimitable pastless futureless PRESENT. To the uttermost bounds of
space rushes the Voice of Ages, unheard save in the concentrated unity
of the thought-formulated Abstract, and eternally that Voice formulates
a Word which is glyphed in the vast ocean of limitless life.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[266:2](tku55.htm#fr_219.md) The thirteen
conformations of the beard of Macroprosopus.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[266:3](tku55.htm#fr_220.md) The Trinity completed
by the Quaternary.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[267:1](tku55.htm#fr_221.md) Kether, the first
Sephira, from which all the other Sephiroth, proceed, namely, those
which are summed up in the Tetragrammaton.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[267:2](tku55.htm#fr_222.md) I.e., His
manifestation is triune.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[267:3](tku55.htm#fr_223.md) This refers to the
Triads in the Sephiroth, when the Autz Chaiim. is formed. (See
Introduction.) It will be found that in this arrangement of the ten
Sephiroth there are ten Triads, viz.:

\(1\) Kether, Chokmah, Binah.  
(2) Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth.  
(3) Netzach, Hod, Yesod.  
(4) Chokmah, Chesed, Netzach.  
(5) Tephereth, Yesod, Malkuth.  
(6) Binah, Geburah, Hod.  
(7) Chokmah, Tiphereth, Hod.  
(8) Binah, Tiphereth, Netzach.  
(9) Chesed, Tiphereth, Hod.  
(10) Geburah, Tiphereth, Netzach.

Wherein Kether and Malkuth are each repeated once: Chokmah, Binah,
Chesed, and Geburah thrice; Tiphereth, six times, Netzach and Hod each
four times; and Yesod twice.
