# CHAPTER XXXVII.

### CONCERNING THE THIRD PART OF THE BEARD OF MICROPROSOPUS.

867\. "ALSO we have learned, Bearing iniquity is this second
conformation called, like as in the Holy Ancient One.

868\. "But because that path which goeth forth in the third disposition
beneath the two nostrils is filled with short and rigid hairs; hence
because of that path these conformations are not called 'bearing
iniquity and passing over [transgression](errata.htm#7.md);' but these are
collected together in another place.

869\. "Also we have learned in Barietha that three hundred and
seventy-five mercies are comprehended in the benignity of the Ancient of
Days; which are all called primal benignities.

870\. "Like as it is said, Psalm lxxxix. 50: 'Where are thy former
mercies?' And they are all comprehended in the benignity of the Most
Holy Ancient One, the most concealed of all.

871\. "But the benignity of Microprosopus is called ChSD OVLM, *Chesed
Olahm*, the benignity of time.

872\. "And in the 'Book of Concealed Mystery' (*have we learned*) that
on account of the former benignity of the Ancient of Days is he called
'Abundant in Benignity.' But in Microprosopus (*the word*) 'mercy' is
placed alone and absolutely.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

873\. "And therefore is it here written: 'And abundant in benignity;'
and again it is written: 'Keeping mercy for thousands;' plain and
without addition.

874\. "And now we have taught concerning this Name, 'And abundant in
benignity,' because therefrom is mitigated the (*interior*) benignity,
so that it may shine into all the lights (otherwise, this Name,
'Abundant in mercy,' stretcheth down even unto the 'mercy' which is so
called absolutely, so that it may illuminate it, and kindle the lights).

875\. "For we have learned that that path which descendeth beneath the
two nostrils of the nose is filled with short hairs; and concerning this
path, that it is written: 'Passing over transgression' (otherwise, and
the shorter hairs fill that path. But that path is not called 'Passing
over transgression'); because there is therein no occasion for passing
over; for a double reason.

876\. "Firstly, because that path is a hard place for passing over.
(Otherwise, because the hairs which are found therein are hard.)

877\. "Secondly, because the passing over of that path descendeth even
unto the commencement of the mouth.

878\. "But concerning this it is written, Cant. v. 13: 'His lips like
roses <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_153) (that is, red as roses.md),
dropping sweet-smelling myrrh while passing over;' which denoteth
notable redness.

879\. "And this path of that place is a duplex form, and is not
mitigated, whence he who wisheth to threaten toucheth that path twice
with his hand."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_153"></span>[220:1](tku45.htm#fr_154.md) The English version
of this passage readers it, "His lips like lilies, dropping
sweet-smelling myrrh." The word here translated roses by Knorr de
Rosenroth is ShVShNIM, *Shoshanim*, which I think should undoubtedly be
translated "lilies," as in the ordinary version. The symbology of this
chapter is very difficult and obscure.
