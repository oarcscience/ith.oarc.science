# CHAPTER XLV. <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_201.md)

### CONCLUSION.

1131\. HEREUNTO are the concealed words, and the more secret meaning (of
then; hath been set forth in many Places). Blessed is his portion who
hath known and beheld them, and who erreth not therein.

1132\. Because these words are not given forth save unto the Lords of
Lords and the Reapers of the Field, who have both entered into and
departed therefrom.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

1133\. Like as it is written, Hosea xiv. 9: "For the paths of
Tetragrammaton are right, and the just shall walk in them, but
transgressors shall fall therein."

1134\. This have we learned. Rabbi Schimeon wept, and lifted up his
voice and said: "If on account of our words which be here revealed, the
Companions are to be concealed in the Conclave of the world to come, and
are to be taken away from this world, it is justly and rightly done, in
order that they may not reveal (*these secrets*) unto one of the
children of this world."

1135\. Again he said: "I return unto myself. For truly I have revealed
(*these secrets*) before the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed
One with all Concealments; but not for mine own glory, not for the glory
of the house of my father, not for the glory of these my Companions,
have I done (*this thing*).

1136\. "But in order that they might not err in His paths, nor that they
might enter into the portals of His Palace to be made ashamed, nor that
they might be destroyed for their error. Blessed be my portion with them
in the world to come."

1137\. We have learned that before the companions departed from this
Assembly, Rabbi Yosi, Rabbi Chizqiah, and Rabbi Yisa died.

1138\. And the companions beheld that the holy angels carried them away
into that veil expanded above. And Rabbi Schimeon spake a certain word,
and fell upon his face.

1139\. Rabbi Schimeon cried aloud and said: "Wherefore is this? Because
a certain decree hath been decreed against us to punish us, seeing that
through us that hath been revealed which had not been revealed hitherto,
from that day wherein Moses stood upon the mountain of Sinai.

1140\. "Like as it is written, Exod. xxxiv. 28: 'And he was there with
Tetragrammaton forty days and forty

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

nights.' Why then do I tarry here, if therefor I am to be punished?"

1141\. And a Voice was heard which spake, and said: "Blessed art thou,
Rabbi Schimeon, and blessed is thy portion, and that of those companions
who are with thee; for unto ye hath that been revealed which is not
revealed unto the whole supernal host.

1142\. "But come, behold. It is written, Josh. vi. 26: 'And in his
first-born son shall he establish it, and in his youngest son shall he
set up the gates thereof;' much more than in this instance also are
these taken away, seeing that with most severe and vehement study have
they applied their souls (NPShThHVN, *Nepheschethhun*) hereunto at this
time.

1143\. "Blessed is their portion, for assuredly they have been taken
away in perfection; and such were not those who were before them."

1144\. Wherefore died they? We have learned this. When thus far these
words were revealed, the Supernals and Inferiors of those Chariots were
disturbed, and the Voice which revealed the Ancient Word below resounded
through two hundred and fifty worlds.

1145\. And before that those (*three Rabbis*) could recollect their
souls, NShMThIIHV, *Nesehamathiyehu*, among those words (*of that
Voice*) their souls had gone forth with a kiss <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_202.md); and were joined unto that expanded
veil, and the Supernal Angels carried them away.

1146\. But wherefore those? Because they had entered in, and had not
gone forth alternately, before this time. But all the others had entered
in, and had gone forth.

1147\. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: "How blessed

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

is the portion of those three, and therefore also blessed is our
portion!"

1148\. And a second time that Voice pealed forth and said, Deut. iv. 4:
"But ye that did cleave unto Tetragrammaton, your God, are alive every
one of you this day."

1149\. They arose, and behold there was no place whence a fragrance went
not forth.

1150\. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: "From this I perceive that the
world receiveth blessing on account of us."

1151\. And the faces of them all shone, so that men could not look upon
them.

1152\. We have learned that there were ten (*Rabbis*) entered into (*the
Assembly*), and that seven came forth.

1153\. And Rabbi Schimeon rejoiced, and Rabbi Abba was sad.

1154\. On a certain day Rabbi Schimeon sat, and Rabbi Abba with him.
Rabbi Schimeon spake a certain word.

1153\. And they saw those three (*Rabbis*) who had died, and with them
were most beautiful angels, who were showing unto them the supernal
treasures and conclaves, on account of their great dignity.

1156\. And they were entering into a mountain of pure balm; and the soul
of Rabbi Abba was comforted.

1157\. We have learned that after that day the companions did not quit
the house of Rabbi Schimeon.

1158\. And when Rabbi Schimeon revealed the Arcana, there were found
none present there save those (*companions*).

1159\. And Rabbi Schimeon called them the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton,
like as it is written, Zach. iii. 9: "These are the seven eyes of
Tetragrammaton." And this was said concerning us. <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_203.md)

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

1160\. Rabbi Abba spake and said: "We six are lights which shine forth
from a seventh (*light*); thou art the seventh light (*the origin of*)
us all.

1161\. "For assuredly there is no stability in those six, save (what
they derive) from the seventh. For all things depend from the seventh."

1162\. Rabbi Yehudah called him <span id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_204.md)
the Sabbath of all the six (Rabbi).

1163\. Like as it is written: "The Sabbath for Tetragrammaton, holy unto
Tetragrammaton."

1164\. What is the Sabbath? Holy unto Tetragrammaton; so also Rabbi
Schimeon is, like the Sabbath, holy unto Tetragrammaton.

1165\. Rabbi Schimeon said: "It is strange that he <span
id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_205.md) who is girded about the loins, and
clothed with a heavy garment, was not found in the place of our conclave
when those holy matters were revealed!"

1166\. Meanwhile Elihu entered, and three beams of light shone in his
countenance.

1167\. Rabbi Schimeon said unto him: "Why was it that he was not present
(otherwise, Why was not my lord present) in the sculptured square of his
Lord in the nuptial day?"

1168\. He answered unto him: "Through thy life, Rabbi, seven were chosen
before Him, the Holy One--may He be blessed!--(otherwise, seven days are
prostrate before the blessed God) all those who could come and abide
with Him, before that ye could enter into the House of Conclave.

1169\. "And I prayed that I might come among the others, and I wished to
adhere unto His shoulders (otherwise, And I asked Him, that it might be
permitted me to enter in, but He constrained my shoulders), and I could
not.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

1170\. "For in that day was I sent that I might perform miracles for Rav
Hamenuna the elder and his companions, who had been taken away into the
palace (otherwise: into the prison) of the King.

1171\. "And I performed a miracle for them, and cast down the King's
rampart (otherwise: I cast down the wall of the royal palace for them),
with whose chains they were bound; so that (*their*) forty-five warders
were kept back.

1172\. "And I led forth Rav. Hamenuna and his companions, and brought
them up unto the valley of Aunu; and they have been set free.

1173\. "And I have given unto them bread and water, seeing they had not
eaten for three days.

1174\. "And all the day I quitted them not.

1175\. "And when I returned (*hither*), I found the Veil expanded which
all these Columns <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_206.md) upheld; and
three of the Companions (*had ascended*) above it.

1176\. "And I spake unto them, and they answered: 'This is the portion
of God the most Holy One--may He be blessed!--from the nuptials <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_207.md) of Rabbi Schimeon and his companions.'

1177\. "Blessed art thou, Rabbi Schimeon, and blessed is thy portion,
and that of those companions who are sitting in thy presence.

1178\. "How many paths are prepared for ye in the world to come! how
many lights of lights are prepared that they may enlighten ye!

1179\. "And come, behold! Therefore on this day there are bound together
for thee fifty crowns for Rabbi Benchas Ben Yair, thy father-in-law, and
I walk with him.

1180\. "And all those are rivers of the mountains of pure balm, for
assuredly his place and lot is chosen (otherwise: and I saw that he had,
&c.).

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

1181\. (*Rabbi Schimeon*) said unto him: "Are therefore the just united
by the Union of the Diadems more on the days of the New Moon, of the
feasts, and of the Sabbaths, than on any other days? "

1182\. He answered unto him: "Most certainly; also all those who are
without. Like as it is written, Isa. lxvi. 23: 'And it shall come to
pass that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath unto
another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith
Tetragrammaton.'

1183\. "If those come, how much more the just!

1184\. "Wherefore from one new moon unto another? Because the patriarchs
surround the Holy Chariot.

1185\. "And from one Sabbath unto another Sabbath, because the seventh
day is surrounded by all the other six days.

1186\. "Like as it is written: 'And the Elohim blessed the seventh day,'
&c.

1187\. "And thou, Rabbi Schimeon, art the seventh: thou shalt be the
chief; and thou shalt be more crowned and sanctified than all.

1188\. "And with three most delicious feasts of the seventh day shall
the just be entertained because of thee in the world to come.

1189\. "Also it is written, Isa. lviii. 13: 'Thou shalt call the sabbath
a delight, the holy of Tetragrammaton, honourable.'

1190\. "Who is He, the Holy One of Tetragrammaton? This is Rabbi
Schimeon Ben Yochai, who is called very glorious (*both*) in this world
and in (*the world*) to come."

Hereunto is the Greater Holy Assembly.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_201"></span>[251:1](tku53.htm#fr_203.md) It is worthy of note
that the total number of chapters in the "Idra Rabba Qadisha" is 45,
which is equal to MH, *Mah*, the concealed name of Yetzirah. (See
Introduction concerning the Four Worlds.)

<span id="fn_202"></span>[253:1](tku53.htm#fr_204.md) The palace which is
situate in the secret and most elevated part of heaven is called the
Palace of Love. There dwells the Heavenly King--blessed be He!--with the
holy souls, and is united with them with a loving kiss. This kiss is the
union of the soul with the substance from which it emanated.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[254:1](tku53.htm#fr_205.md) Meaning, I suppose,
that Rabbi Abba adds this by way of note to the test.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[255:1](tku53.htm#fr_206.md) Him: *i.e.*, Rabbi
Schimeon Ben Yochai, who was chief among the seven surviving Rabbis,
like the Sabbath among the days of the week.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[255:2](tku53.htm#fr_207.md) Elihu, who now
enters.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[256:1](tku53.htm#fr_208.md) The columns of the
Sephiroth.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[256:2](tku53.htm#fr_209.md) This term is
occasionally used in a mystical sense to signify the acquisition of
divine wisdom.
