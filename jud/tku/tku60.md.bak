# CHAPTER VII.

### CONCERNING THE BRAIN AND THE WISDOM IN GENERAL.

168\. OF this Most Holy Ancient One, Concealed with all Concealments,
there is no mention made, neither is He found.

169\. For since this Head is the supreme of all the supernals, hence He
is only symbolized as a head alone without body, for the purpose of
establishing all things.

170\. And He Himself is concealed, and hidden, and kept recondite by all
things.

171\. His conformation is that He is formed forth in that brain, the
most hidden of all things, which is expanded and formed forth, and hence
proceedeth the superior and inferior ChSD, *Chesed*, Mercy.

172\. And the superior Chesed is formed forth and expanded, and all
things are comprehended in this concealed brain.

173\. For when that White Brilliance is formed forth in that Light, it
acteth upon that which acteth upon this brain, and it is enlightened.

174\. And the second brain dependeth from that very glorious Influence,
it is expanded into the thirty-two <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_230.md)

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

paths, when it is illuminated, then it shineth from that very glorious
Influence. <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_231.md)

175\. Therefore are the Three Supernal Heads illuminated; Two Heads, and
One which comprehendeth them; and they hang in that Influence, and by It
are they comprehended.

176\. Hence becometh the ornament of the beard to be manifested, which
is the occult Influence.

177\. And those inferiors are conformed, like as the Most Holy Ancient
One.

178\. The Three Heads surround Him; thus all things can appear in the
Three Heads; and when they are illuminated all things depend together
from Him in the Three Heads, whereof two are on the two sides, and one
which includeth them.

179\. And if thou sayest, "Who is the Most Holy Ancient One?" Come and
see. The Supreme Head is that which is not known, nor comprehended, nor
designated, and that (*Head*) comprehendeth all things.

180\. And the Two Heads are contained in Itself. (Otherwise hang, &c.)

181\. And then are all these things thus ordained; truly Himself
existeth not in numeration, nor in system, nor in computation, but in
the judgment of the heart.

182\. Concerning this it is written, Ps. xxxix. 2: "I said I will take
heed unto my ways, that I offend not with my tongue."

183\. The place of commencement is found from the Most Holy Ancient One,
and it is illuminated by the Influence. That is the Light of Wisdom.

184\. And it is extended in thirty-two directions, and departeth from
that hidden brain, from that Light which existeth in Itself.

185\. And because the Most Holy Ancient One shineth in the beginning
(otherwise, in the wisdom), this itself is

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

this. And, the same is that beginning from which manifestation is made.

186\. And is conformed in the Three Heads, which One Head includeth.

187\. And those three are extended into Microprosopus, and from them all
things shine forth.

188\. Thenceforth this Wisdom instituteth a formation, and produceth a
certain river which floweth down and goeth forth to water the garden.

189\. And it entereth into the head of Microprosopus, and formeth a
certain other brain.

190\. And thence it is extended and floweth forth into the whole body,
and watereth all those plants (*of the garden of Eden*).

191\. This is that which standeth written, Gen. ii, 9: "And a river went
out of Eden to water the garden, &c."

192\. But also this Wisdom instituteth another formation, and is
extended and goeth into the head of Microprosopus, and formeth another
brain.

193\. That is the Light from which are produced those two rivulets which
are associated together, carved out hollows in the One Head, which is
called the depth of the fountain. <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_232.md)

194\. Concerning which it is written, Prov. iii. 20: "In DOTh,
*Daath*, <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_233.md) Knowledge, the depths are
broken up."

195\. And it entereth into the head of Microprosopus, and formeth
another brain.

196\. And thenceforth is it extended and goeth into the interior parts
of His body, and filleth all those conclaves and assemblies of His
body. <span id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_234.md)

197\. This is that same which is written, Prov. xxiv. 4: "In Daath shall
the secret places be filled."

198\. And those shine from the Light of that supernal

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

concealed brain which shineth in the Influence, MZL, of the Most Holy
Ancient One.

199\. And all things depend mutually from Himself, and mutually are
bound together unto Himself, until He is known, because all things are
one, and HVA, *Hoa*, He, the Ancient One, is all things, neither from
Him can anything whatsoever be separated.

200\. Into three other Lights, which are called the Fathers, do these
three Lights shine, and these fathers shine into the children, and all
things shine forth from the one place. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_235.md)

201\. When He, that Ancient One, who is the Grace of all Grace, is
manifested, all things are found in light and in perfect happiness.

202\. This Eden is derived from the superior Eden, the Concealed with
all Concealments.

203\. And therefore is that Eden called the beginning in the Ancient
One; neither yet, however, is there beginning or end. <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_236.md)

204\. And since in Him beginning and end exist not, hence He is not
called AThH, *Atah*, Thou; seeing that He is concealed and not revealed.
But HVA, *Hoa*, He, is He called.

205\. But in that aspect wherein the beginning is found, the name AThH,
*Atah*, Thou, hath place, and the name AB, *Ab*, Father. For it is
written, Isa, lxiii. 16: "Since *Atah*, Thou, art *Ab*, our Father."

206\. In the teaching of the school of Rav Yeyeva the Elder, the
universal rule is that Microprosopus be called AThH, *Atah*, Thou; but
that the most Holy Ancient One, who is concealed, be called HVA, *Hoa*,
He; and also with reason.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

207\. Now truly in that place wherein beginning is found, is He thus
called, although He is concealed.

208\. And therefrom is the beginning, and it is called AThH, *Atha*,
Thou; and He is the Father of the Fathers.

20g. And that Father proceedeth from the Most Holy Ancient One, like as
it is written, Job. xxviii. 12: "And ChKMH, *Chokmah*, <span
id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_237.md) Wisdom, is found from AIN, *Ain*, the
Negatively Existent One;" and therefore is He not known.

210\. Come and see! It is written, *ibid*. 22: "The Elohim have known
the path;" His path, properly speaking.

211\. But again, further on: VHVA, *Va-Hoa*, and He Himself knoweth His
place; "His place properly speaking; much more His path; and much more
this WISDOM which is concealed in the Most Holy Ancient One.

212\. This Wisdom is the beginning of all things. Thencefrom are
expanded the thirty-two paths: ShBILIN, *Shebilin*, Paths, I say; and
not ARChIN, *Archin*, Byways.

213\. And in them is the Law comprehended, in the twenty-two letters and
in the ten utterances. <span id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_238.md)

214\. This Chokmah is the Father of Fathers, and in this Chokmah is
beginning and end discovered; and therefore is there one Chokmah
supernal, and another Chokmah inferior.

215\. When Chokmah is extended, then is He called the Father of Fathers,
for in none else are all things comprehended save in Him. (Otherwise,
when they are expanded all things are called Chokmoth, <span
id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_239.md) and the Father of Fathers; all things
are comprehended in no place, save herein.)

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

20\. As it is written, Ps. civ. 25: "All things in Chokmah hast Thou
formed."

217\. Rabbi Schimeon lifted up his hands, and rejoiced, and said:
Assuredly it is Eden or Paradise, and all things have their operation in
this hour.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_230"></span>[276:1](tku60.htm#fr_233.md) The ten numbers and
twenty-two letters.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[277:1](tku60.htm#fr_234.md) MZL = 40 + 7 + 30 =
77, which is OZ, Strength or Vigour. This Gematria is worthy of note as
giving the idea of foundational power.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[278:1](tku60.htm#fr_235.md) *i.e.*, the
containing power.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[278:2](tku60.htm#fr_236.md) Daath is the
conjunction of Chokmah and Binah. (See "Book of Concealed Mystery," ch.
i. § 40.)

<span id="fn_234"></span>[278:3](tku60.htm#fr_237.md) "See Greater Holy
Assembly," ch. xxviii § 566.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[279:1](tku60.htm#fr_238.md) This is analogous to
the teaching of the "Sepher Yetzirah," that the Three Mothers A, M, Sh,
radiate into three paternal forms of the same. A, M, and Sh, symbolize
the potencies of Air, Water, and Fire.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[279:2](tku60.htm#fr_239.md) For commencement
denotes end, and end denotes commencement; how, then, in the Absolute
can there be either. Nevertheless, in the Absolute must we seek for the
hypothetical starting-point of life.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[280:1](tku60.htm#fr_240.md) Let the student
carefully note that this is the second Sephira, the I of IHVH, the
Father proceeding from Macroprosopus, Kether, as He proceedeth from Ain
Soph.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[280:2](tku60.htm#fr_241.md) The Sephiroth, or
numbers.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[280:3](tku60.htm#fr_242.md) Chokmoth is plural of
Chokmah, Wisdom.
