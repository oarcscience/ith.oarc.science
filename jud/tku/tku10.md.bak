# CHAPTER II.

### OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORLD OF VACANCY.

25\. HE manifested the Arcanum, and commencing, said, Gen. xxxvi. 29:
"And those are the kings which reigned in the land of Edom before that a
king could rule over the children of Israel."

26\. Blessed are ye, O just men! because unto you is manifested the
Arcanum of the Arcana of the law, which hath not been manifested unto
the holy superior ones.

27\. Who can follow out this matter? and who is worthy to do so? For it
is the testimony of the truth of truths. Therefore let all our prayers
be undertaken with devotion, lest it be imputed (*to me*) as a sin, that
I am making this matter manifest.

28\. And perchance my companions may speak unto me, because some
objection may arise against these words. For truly this work is not such
a one as may be easily written down, so that by it may appear how many
kings there were before the children of Israel came, and before there
was a king over the children of Israel: how therefore doth this matter
agree? And for this reason my companions have moved the question.

29\. Therefore the Arcanum of Arcana is what men can neither know nor
comprehend, nor can they apply their rules of science to it.

30\. It is said that before the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the
Concealed One of the Concealed Ones, instituted the formations of the
King (

under certain members and paths

of Microprosopus) and the diadems of the diadems (*that is, the varied
coverings whereby the superfluity of the Lights is circumscribed*);
beginning and end existed not (*that is, there was neither communication
nor reception*).

3 1. Therefore He carved out (*that is, hollowed out a space by which he
might flow in*) and instituted proportions in Himself (*in as many ways
as the Lights of his Understanding could be received, whence arose the
paths of the worlds*), and spread out before Him a certain veil (*that
is, produced a certain nature, by which His infinite light could be
modified, which was the first Adam*); and therein carved out and
distributed the kings and their forms by a certain proportion (*that is,
all creatures under a condition of proper activity; by which He Himself
might be known and loved*); but they did not subsist. (*Here is
intimated the fall of the creatures, partly into a condition of quiet,
such as matter; partly into a state of inordinate motion, such as that
of the evil spirits*).

32\. That is the same thing which is said, Gen. xxxvi. 29: "And these
are the kings which reigned in the land of Edom, before that there
reigned a king over the children of Israel." The first king in respect
of the children of Israel (*by the children of Israel are understood the
paths of the restored world*) is the first.

33\. And all those things which were carved out, but subsisted not, are
called by their names (*that is, were divided into certain classes*),
neither yet did they subsist, until He forsook them (*so that they could
receive the lights from the receptacles above themselves*), and hid
Himself before them (in diminished light).
