# CHAPTER XXIX.

### CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.

570\. WE have learned that from the skull of His head (*i.e., of
Microprosopus*) hang one thousand times a thousand myriad myriads of
locks of black hair, and they are intertwined together each to the
other, and they are mingled together.

571\. But there is no classification made of the locks of hair
separately, because pure and impure alike adhere to each other therein,
and here (*the description above given*) mentions both pure and impure
together.

572\. In all those sides which are pure, and in all those which are
impure, there are intricate and dense locks of hair, some of which are
soft, some hard.

573\. And in single locks doth the hair hang down, curls upon curls,
which emit flames, and hang down in beautiful and strong array, like
those of a brave hero victorious in war.

574\. They are excellent as the great and foliated cedars. This is that
which is written, Cant. v. 15: "Excellent as the cedars."

575\. The curling locks are parted on this side and on that above the
head.

576\. Also we have learned that they remain in curls because they
proceed from many fountains of the three canals of the brain.

577\. For from the fountain of one cavity of the skull proceedeth the
hair, and it becomes curls upon curls (formed), from the fountains
proceeding from that cavity.

578\. From the second cavity there go forth fifty fountains, and from
those fountains the hair issueth, and it becometh curls upon curls, and
they are mingled with the other locks.

579\. From the third cavity there go forth a thousand times a thousand
conclaves and assemblies, and from them all the hair issueth; and it
becometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks.

580\. And therefore are those locks so curling, and all the progeny of
them is produced from the three cavities of the brain of the skull.

58t. And all those curls hang down and are spread over the sides of the
ears.

532\. And therefore is it written, Dan. ix. 18: "Incline thine ear, O my
God, and hear."

583\. And in those curls there are found alike right and left, <span
id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_101.md) light and dark, mercy and judgment, and
everything (*that hath in itself the qualities of*) right and left
dependeth thence (*from Microprosopus*), and not from the Ancient
One. <span id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_102.md)

584\. In the parting of the hair appeareth a certain slender path, which
hath a certain connection with that path of the Ancient of Days, and
from that path are divided six hundred and thirteen paths, <span
id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_103.md) which are

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

distributed among the paths of the precepts of the law.

585\. Like as it is written, Ps. xxv. 6: "All the paths of
Tetragrammaton are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and
His testimony."

586\. We have learned that in the single locks a thousand times a
thousand utterances of the speech of Tetragrammaton are found, which
depend from the single locks.

587\. Among them some are hard (*rigorous*) and some soft (*merciful*),
as (*belonging unto*) the Lord of the equilibrium (or, the Lord of
mercy, who is an equilibrium between these); and therefore is He
(*Microprosopus*) said to include right and left.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_100"></span>[181:1](tku36.htm#fr_101.md) As the mediating path
between them.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[182:1](tku37.htm#fr_102.md) Whereas Macroprosopus
is symbolized only by the right side of the profile.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[182:2](tku37.htm#fr_103.md) For the reason I have
given in the preceding note.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[182:3](tku37.htm#fr_104.md) The precepts of the
law are said to be 613 in number, which is also expressed by Gematria in
the words "Moses our Rabbi"; MShH RBINV, *Mosheh Rabbino* = 40 + 300 + 5
+ 200 + 2 + 10 + 50 + 6 = 613.
