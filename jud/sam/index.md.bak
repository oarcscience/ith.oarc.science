# The Samaritans

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ancient sect has close historical ties to the Jewish faith.
However, they have an entirely separate set of traditions and customs
which diverged from Judaism long ago, before it was codified and
homogenized. For instance, they believe that only the Pentateuch is
divinely inspired. Their language is still written using an archaic
version of the Hebrew alphabet. The Samaritans, who were persecuted and
shunned outsiders, are ironically best known because of a short parable
in the New Testament in which a Samaritan does a good deed for a victim
of a mugging ([Luke 10:25](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#10:25).md). Today, about
300 Samaritans live in the West Bank in the vicinity of Nablus on Mount
Gerizim, preserving their customs and language. For more information on
